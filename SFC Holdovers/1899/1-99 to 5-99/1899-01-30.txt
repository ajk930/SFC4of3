MANILA. Jan. 29. â The Spanish civil prisoners have not yet been
released. Tales of suffering, hunger and dishonor co from the pro

His reply was a letter from a dishono; 1 childâ exacted after God

HAVANA, Jan. 29.â Four thousand peo

gaily dressedâ stood amid a pouring rain
in Paula square to-day listening to six
intensely, patriotic eulogies upon Jose
Marti, the Cuban patriot and first Presi
dent of the Cuban revolutionary govern

in a street near by. and eighty-two so

banners, flags and five bands, marched

the patriot, which was loudly cheered
Ihe eulogies contained few references
to the nited States or the military ad
ministration, and the only vituperative
references to the Spaniards .vere quietly
received. *
The tendency of all the speeches was
toward the -â  Tnate independence of
Cuba, which the orators reo â â --ized as a
fart not yet acomplished. They declared
that all Cubans should unite to reach
that great end, to make their desires

the Cubans to go to work.
Juan Gomez, a mulatto with a consider
able reputation as an orator, made the
best speech of the day. He counseled
firmness and determination as means to
obtain t'.e coveted independence
"The power which has intervened be

striving for," he said, "is unfamiliar with
the ways and habits of our race, and nat

which is made again to-day, has in this instance substantial
foundation. Current opinion among the best-informed
Catholics is that the Archbishop's elevation is entirely

NEW LIIiHT ON THE
POISONING MYSTERY
George W. Koutnik Tells of a Man
Who Asked to Take a Package
to Cornish.
NEW YORK. Jan. 29.â Interest in the
Adams poisoning cases centered at police
headquarters to-day. A story was cur
rent that Georgo W. Koutnik, a young
man living in Hoboken, N. J., had fur
nished one of the missing clews to the
police. He said to the police that on the
evening of December 23 he had met a man
at Madison avenue and Fortieth street,
who asked him to deliver a package ad
dressed to Harry Cornish at the Knicker
bocker Athletic Club. This he refused to
do, he said, but agreed to mail the pack
age at the General Postoffiee, which he
did. According to his story the man from
whom he received the package answered
the description of one of the men promi
nently mentioned in the poisoning case.
This afternoon Koutnik was taken before
Chief Devery and Captain McCluskey,
District Attorney Gardiner and others at
police headquarters, and after the confer
ence Chief McCluskoy said that Koutnik
had practically repeated the story to the
officials as he had originally told it.
Koutnik was thereupon detained as a wit
ness In the case. George W. Koutnik has,
however, been before the public eye sev
eral times before.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 29.â At the home
of John Garter, near Clarksburg, hia
youngest son, age" about J2 years, and the
boy's older brother, about 15, did a shot
gun trick to-day whioh resulted in the for
mer's death. They had for some time past
put unloaded cartridge shells in the gun,
dropped a marble in the muzzle, and the
older boy would explode the primer. Inis
had justenough strength to send the mar
ble a few feet, and the younger boy
would catch it in its flight. They were to
have performed the trick to-day, but the
cartridge in the gun. which they sup
posed to be empty, proved to be loaded.
When the gun was discharged the load of
powder and shot took effect in the young
er boy's head, shattering it in a horrid
manner. Death was almost instantan
eous.

DAN BURNS URGES
WRIGHT TO RESIGN
Man From Mexico Has Troubles of
His Own Without Sharing the
Disgraced Speaker's.
MIDNIGHT CONFERENCE
The Oft- Purchased Legislator
Withholds His Decision, but
Is Likely to Follow This
Course.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 29.â Howard E. Wright
returned to this city to-night. He went
to Winters yesterday afternoon, where
his wife is temporarily sojourning. At
Winters he was V guest of Hart
North, ex-Assemblyman, who served in
the Legislature two years ago.
When Wright boarded the train at
Davisville this evening to return to
Sacramento he had not made up his
mind to resign the Speakership of the
Assembly. Shortly alter his arrival
here he was summoned to the presence
of Colonel Burns, and quite a pro
longed conference followed.
WheiV the conference began Wright
was In no frame of mind to listen to
the suggestion that it was in his power
to render the "organization" a service
by resigning. Under the pressure of
argument he was persuaded to view the
situation in the u^ly light of facts.
The result of the interview was not an
nounced for publication. Various ver
sions are afloat concerning the talk
between the Speaker and the Colonel.
Judge Dibble, who was consulted re
garding the peculiar situation, posi
tively declined to s- a word concern
ing the course which Burns has decid
ed to pursue. " The fact Is Burns told
Wright that he could not afford to sus
tain him.
"I have all I can do," caid the Col
onel, "to take cafe of my own fluht,
and at the present time cannot take
your flght on my hands. I cannot af
ford to be denounced from ?very pulpit
in the State and c idemned by the peo
ple for upholding everything and every
body."
Wright left the Golden Eaerle Hotel
immediately after the interview. He
went to his room to get a night's rest.
Actions which sometimes speak louder j
than words indicated that he was fully !
conscious of the fact that he could not |
expect sympathy and support from the i
Burns following in the Legislature, j ,
Wright may decide before morning to ,
tender his resignation, but before the :
decision is finally announced he will
confer with many of his former friends j
to ascertain to a certainty what course '
they intend to adopt. In his mind there
is a lingering hope that sympathy for !
a young man may save him from the 1
disgrace incident to deposition from the j
Speaker's chair.
Before the interview with Burns took I
place Wright was met at the depot by ]
several of his close friends. Their ; 1
friendship of the past had been so close |
and intimate that they deemed it their j
duty to advise Wright as to his future
course. They went over the "round '
with the Speaker and advised him to ; !
write a letter to the Assembly, tender- 1 1
ing his resignation and d?mandine that I
it be accepted. It was suggested that
Wright, in this letter, should present
his own views to the Assembly and to
say in conclusion that he resigned be

tain the position of Speaker as lone ftÂ«
any member of the Assembly consid
ered him guilty of wrongdoing.
When the conference wherein Dibble.
Burns and Wright participated took
place the Speaker was advised that he
could promote harmony and hasten the
termination of the Senatorial struggle
by resigning the Speakership and tak
ing his place on the floor of the As
sembly. Burns spoke freely on the sub
ject, remarking that he had always
stood by his friends, and therefore ad
vised Wright as a friend that the wisest
course to pursue was to tender his res
ignation. He insisted that resistance
would provoke a long and bitter con
test, which would delay legislation and
intensify the existing bitterness, and
In the end Wright would gain nothing
by provoking antagonism. Wright lis
tened, but was not convinced. He asked
more time to consider the proposition,
indicating at the close of the conference
that he would make known his decision
to-morrow morning.
To-night the closest friends of
"Wright believe that he will accept the
advice given him by Burns. The few
inquiries he has made since the ad
journment of the Legislature yester
day have convinced him that several
prominent members on whose support
he counted will vote for the adoption of
the report.
WILL CALL UP PAST
SENATORIAL ELECTIONS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 29.â Sensational features
may mark the debate in the Assembly on
the report of the Wright Investigation
committee.
It is said to-day that one of the lead
ing Republicans in the Legislature and an
active supporter of 1 an Burns is prepar
ing a speech in which he proposes to re
view the Senatorial campaigns in Cali
fornia since 1880. He may not go back to
the Casserly election, when the merchants
of San Francisco contributed more than
$100,000 for disbursement in the Legisla
ture, but he will begin with a review of
the campaign which terminated in the
election of General Miller to the Senate.
Testimony cannot be prouueed to show
the amount disbursed In aid of Senator
Miller's cause, but common report will be
cited to prove that candidates for the
Legislature on the Republican ticket were
materially assisted.
Special reference will be made to the
Hearst campagn, and the lavish use of
that millionaire's coin to debauch a Dem
ocratic Legislature. It will be shown
that Green's disbursements of money to
promote Grant's chances were but little
sprinkles compared with the outpouring
of coin then to assist impecunious Demo
crats. Then, the ugly fact will be pre
sented that the Hearst chattels were of
the Wright ilk. and would not stay bought
after they were purchased the first time,
but compelled the millionaire miner to
put up the second time to obtain their
loyal support. â¢
The history to be reviewed in the speech
will be carried down to the celebrated

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 29.â When
Ulysses S. Grant becomes convinced, and his friends likewise, that he
is an absolute impossibility in the Senatorial fight, he will retire.
But to this retirement of Grant as a factor in the contest there is
one condition attached. Mr. Grant, and his followers, likewise, must
be convinced that his retirement will insure the election of some citizen
of the State other than Daniel M. Burns.
â¢As to who this man is. the Grant men are not at this time ready to
make any statement. All they .will ask is that the man to receive their
support, or the greater portion of it, shall be an honorable, a clean and an
able man.
But the Grant men will not leave their favorite as lonp as there is
the remotest possibility of the election of Burns. They will stand solid
until the end of the session if it is necessary.
This information comes direct from one of Mr. Grant's closest
friends.
ator Stanford. The purpose of bringing
out pas! scandals is to show to Assembly
men that the money spending features of
this campaign were trivial in comparison
with former transactions in the domain of
practical politics.
Reflection may restrain the author of
peech from expressing his sentiments
on the floor of the Assembly. He compre
hends clearly that an utterance of the
character outlined would be construed as
istfncatlon of Gram's conduct in
throwing' out money to assist in the elec
tion of the Republican legislative ticket.
The colonel has defined a course which
his followers are to pursue, but his chief
ppokesman In the Assembly declined tins
afternoon to indicate the lines of that
course. Considerable censure has already
fallen on Colonel Burns for forcing
"Wright to show his hand. It is argued
that the commonest kind of gratitude will
impel Burr.? to care for and shield his dis
graced Speaker. Quick to catch the hint
of Burns' dlUmma. the Grant and Btilla
men hold out no helping hand to save
Wright.
â  nel Burns did expect a substantial
advantage as the result of the Wright
scandaJ. Others thought at first that the
colonel would profit by the â¢ xposure, but
this view of the probable result has un
dergone a marked change. Now it ap
thal Burns will lose rather than
gain strength by reason of the scandal.

attraction to lure others to the Burns
The twisting screws were placed on

to be a dead weight. Burns Is now toreed
to face about in order to protect his

WHY MODERN NOVELISTS ARE
DRAMATISTS.
It has been noticed with some surprise
of late that all the most successful
dramatists of the day are novelists first
of all. and that the dramatists pure and
simple have had to take the second place.
Not many years ago it -was accepted as
an axiom that the arts of the novelist
and of the- dramatist were utterly dis
tinct, and that in the unlikely event of a
novel being: suited for the stage the aid
of a skilled dramatist was necessary.
But now we see the novelists adapting
their own work for the theater, and, what
is more, doing it most successfully. The
fact is. however, that the novel has ut
terly changed of recent years and is no
longer a drawn-out history of a family or
of a man such as "Tom Jones." "Quentin
Durward." "Martin Chuzzlewit" or "Van
ity Fair." None of these works could pos
sibly be put on the stage in their entirety
but 'the modern novel is far removed from
them. The three-volume novel has en
tirely disappeared from amorig us, and
the one-volume novel has taken Its place,
with the result that instead of being spun
out over a number of years from the
hero's birth to his marriage, as used to
be the 'fashion, the latter-day novel deals
with one incident only, and deals with
that much in the same -way as the play
wright builds his piece for the stage. The
novel has ceased to be epic and has be
come dramatic, and consequently needs
but little alteration to make an acceptable
play. The theater remains where it did,
bin' the public taste in novels has altered,
greatly to tbe advantage of the novelist,
who is now able to reap a double harvest
from the reading public and from theater
goers.âLondon Globe.
A Romance in Boston.
It Is not often a real romance Is at
tached to the modern marriage, but there
can be such a remarkable combination,
for it has occurred, in all places of the
world. In this very town. Less than a
year ago a swell young bacheler, break
fasting at his club, began regarding his
morning: mail, which a servant consider
ately brought in with the first course.
Among various Invitations was one for a
dinner party in a fashionable suburb, but
the hostess's name was utterly unknown
to the recipient? Who could this lady be?
Had he ever seen her? No, he thought
not; yet the note was en regie, and the
address was all right, so fearing to make
a blunder, the young gentleman said it
was hotter to accept than to offend some
one whom he had probably met in his
various wanderings, and he would go.
The night of the dinner he therefore pre
sented' himself at the house designated,
but only to ftnd his hosts were utter
strangers, and they equally surprised to
B< c a gentleman who had not been in
vited. A few explanations followed to
the mutual amusement of guest and host
for 11 seems the note of acceptance had
puzzled the latter quite as much as the in
vitation had the guest. But, as It pleas
antly turned out. both were soon in pos
session of those clews to common
acquaintances by which the elect of Bos
ton society hang together, and the
"wrong" guest was cordially given the
prettiest girl in the party, and who hap
pened to be the hostess's niece, to take
out to dinner. The acquaintance thus
begun in an anti-Bostonese fashion was
continued through the summer, and when
a few weeks ago a charming wedding took
place with this young man and young
lady for chief actors, the conventional
and unwritten Brahminical rules of Bos
ton society received a shock that did
them a heap of good. Fate sometimes
resorts yi devious ways to bring true
hearts together, and in spite of it being a
â elfish, practical ago, romance still flour
ishes In It.â Boston Herald.
He Saw the Point.
The following story is told of a Phila
delphia millionaire who has been dead
some years. A young man came to him
one day and asked pecuniary aid to start
him in business.
"Do you drink?" asked the millionaire.
"Once in a while."
"Stop it! Stop it for a year, and then
come and sec me." The young man broke
off the habit at once, and at the end of
the year came to see the millionaire
again.
"Do you smoke?" asked the successful
man.
"Now and then."
"Stop it! Stop It for a year and then
come and see me again. "
The young man went home and broke
away from this habit. It took him some
time, but finally he worried through the
year, and presented himself again.
"Do you chew?" asked the philanthro
pist.
"Yes, I do," was the desperate reply. â 
"Stop it! Stop it for a year; then come
and see me again." The young man
stopped chewing, but he never went back
again. When asked by his anxious friends
why he never called on the millionaire
again he replied that he knew exactly
what the man was driving at. "He'd have
told me that now that I have stopped
drinking and smoking and chewing I must
have saved enough to start mvseli in
business. And I have."â Youth's Com

MENTO, Jan. 29.â Senator John F. Davia
of Amador County, together with Assem
blyman Dunlap of San Joaquin, have
been, since the balloting commenced on
the Senatorship, supporters of the candi
dacy of Irving M. Scott. Senator J>;ivis
States that he will stand by Mr. Scott to
the end. This being the cusp, his rea
sons for continuing to support *>lr. Scott
art of interest.
"Is it true that you never met Irving M.
Scott till he came to Sacramento lately?"
a Call representative asked Senator Davis
this evening.
"That Is the fact," replied Senator
Davis, "except that eight years ago I
heard Mr. Scott reply to a toast at a
banquet given by the Oakland Alliance
Club, when, after the election of Governor
Markham, the Los Angeles delegation re
turned the flag to Alameda County as tae
banner Republican county of the State."
'"Why have you given Mr. Scott your
support?"
"Because I thin* Irving M. Scott is the
man for the crisis."
"Do you object to specifying in what
respect?"
"No, I do not. I feel that the war with
Spain, though begun merely for the
amelioration of humanity, has left us a
legacy of the most momentous problems
that have ever confronted the republic.
Great commercial readjustments have Ir
resistibly come upon us. and California
Is destined, if proper advantage is taken
of her opportunity, to be of all the States
the chief beneficiary of the war. Let uu
look at this matter not as partisans, but
as Californians. California has now the
opportunity for which she has been wait
ing for a Quarter of a century. The
war has already given us the Hawaiian
Islands, has settled the point that the
Pacific railroad debt must be paid, every
dollar, principal and interest, and that
th<^ Nicaragua canal is as certain to be
built as the programme of the MeKinley
administration can make It. Vast groups
of Islands, whether as colonies, protector
ates, territories or otherwise, are to form
stepping-stones to greater Oriental trade.
The construction or the Nicaragua canal
will revolutionize the conditions of trade
on this coast. The inevitable result will
be to force the clutch of monopoly from
off the throat of our merchant marine.
San Francisco and San Pedro harbors are
destined to become hives of activity, and
in fhe resultant creations of new indus
tries and the development of old ones on
this coast the commercial stagnation of
the last twenty years will have gone for
ever. The questions of the immediate fu
ture for California are, in short, essen
tially those incident to commercial ag
grandizement."
"You feel. then, that a man connected
with commercial industries, rather than
8 politician or a lawyer, should be
chosen?"
"Well, the Legislature should bar no
one on account of his profession or busi
ness, provided he is alive to the situa
tion. I cannot help feeling, however, that
Irving M. Scott would, under the exist
ing circumstances, be just the man for
the State. Here Is a man who is a World
beater. He has climbed from the foot of
the ladder. By his own unaided genius,
by the power of his own brain and skill,
against almost inconceivable odds, he has
risen from being a draughtsman in a

of one of the most successful shipbuilding
firms in the world. He has been most
prominently identified with our commer
cial industries and with every movement
for good government. If sent to the
United States Senate, his standing in the
community is such that he could not af
ford to be any less successful than he
has been in private life. California, if
properly represented at this time, IS' des
tined to play as important a part 111
shaping ttte result as she did in shaping
the course of the war. I know of no one
in California at this time who would by
his ability, by his genins, by hts record as
a man of achievement, by his standing at
home and Abroad, bring with him on to
the floor' of the tnited States Bfedate

RUMORS OF WESTERN
RAILROAD DEAL
Broker Talks of the Significance of
the Visit of Mrs. Stanford and
Crocker to New York.
NEW YORK, Jan. 29.â A morning paper
says: A broker in Wall street, who ia
identified with deals in leading Western
railway stocks, said at an up-town club
last night that he regarded the an
nouncement by Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stan
ford, widow of the late Senator Lt'land
Stanford, of her intention to visit this city
as highly significant.
"The lady has admitted," said he, "that
she ts coming on business connected with
the Central Pacific road, of which she
holds a large block of stock. It has been
reported for some time that the Vander
hilts are desirous of getting control of a
Western outletâ one that will connect the
systems which they control with the Pa
cific Coast."
The broker would say nothing definite,
bin he threw out hints about it big deal
in Western railroad shares, which he said
he thought would be closed before the
week was over. Only a few Hays ago one
of the Vanderbilts made a public denial of.
any intention on his part to capture- a
Pacific Coast road and continue the 2Â£ew
York Central system to San Francisco. It
is pretty well known, however, that W.
K. Vanderbilt has been a heavy buyer of
Central Pacific stock during the past two
weeks and has materially strengthened
his hold on the road.
Mrs. Stanford will probably arrive here
on Tuesday or Wednesday. She was pre
reriori by George Crocker, who is also in
terested in Pacific Coast railways. With
Mrs. Stanford and Crocker both here, it
may be assumed that "something will bo
doing" on the stock exchange in a few
days.
REMARKABLE TRIP

SEATTLE. Jan. 29.â The first prospector
to arrive here from the Kayukuk mining
district of Alaska Plnce navigation closed
last fall is B. C. Nichols. His trip is a
most remarkable one, when it is consid
ered that Mr. Nichols is almost blind.
Mr. Nichols came down the Kayukuk to
the Yukon, which he ascended to Dawson
city. He walked a great portion of the
way behind his dog team.
J. Dietrich, a mining engineer of Ran
Francisco, who accompanied Nichols part
of the way, brings news that a relief
party had gone from Seventy-mile Camp
some time ago in search of a party of
six prospectors who were reported to
have had their feet and legs frozen while
crossing Porcupine liiver. The party had
not returned and there was some anxiety
concerning them.
At Fort Selkirk A. L. Breckenridge of
Portland, Or., had brought in G. T. Watts
of Oregon City, who was Fiiffering with
scurvy. Breckenridge reported three
other men sick with scurvy in their
cabins about Forty-mile. They were sadly
in need of assistance and would probably
die before spring If it was not tendered
them.

CLEVER RUSE OF
A COUNTERFEITER
Why Irwin's Sentence
Was Light.
HIS PRETENDED CONFESSION
SAN RAFAEL CITIZEN NAMED AS
ACCOMPLICE.
Henry C. Gieske a Leading Merchant
and Prominent Democratic Politi
cian, "Shadowed" by Secret
Service Agents.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL, Jan. 29.â T0 say that
Henry C. Gieske, a leading merchant
and prominent Democratic politician of
this city, was dumfounded yesterday on
learning that for over a week he has
rested under the suspicion of being an
accomplice of Charles Irwin. the vet
eran counterfeiter, would be to nut the
matter mildly. Yet it is now known
that the aged criminal played the fox
and endeavored to get himself a light
sentence by promising to reveal the
name of an accomplice to one of his
numerous crimes, and finally made a
confession implicating no less impor
tant and respected a person than Gieske
himself.
In the early part of last autumn a
complete counterfeiter's outfit was dis
covered by the authorities hidden in a
culvert on the north side of San Rafael
hill, less than a mile from the center
of town. Secret Service Agent Brown
was apprised of the discovery and
speedily arrived at the conclusion that
the apparatus belonged to Charles Ir
win, who had served several terms in
San Quentin prison for "shoving the
queer." This happy discovery ex
plained where the spurious money .with
which Marin County was flooded Â«t
that time had been coming from, and
why the poolroom men at Sausalito
had their coffers full of the bogus coin.
-v short while ago Irwin was captured
at Napa and taken to San Francisco.
He confessed that he was responsible
for the counterfeit coin so largely cir
culated in Marln County, and was sent
to San Quentin for three years, It be
ing stated at the timp that the light
sentence was given on account of Irwin
being past 70 years of age. Further de
velopments, seem to warrant a belief
that there was another and more co
gent reason.
Last Monday a ' â nger visited
Gieske's store and had him change a
twenty-dollar piece. Later In the day
another stranger came in with non
chalant mien and also dropped a sim
ilar coin on the counter with a request
for change. Since Monday no less than
eight men, none of whom Gieske had
ever seen before, came into his store
and substituted gold coins for silver.
The merchant also soon became aware
of the discomforting fact that all his
movements after twilight were being
shadowed.
For several days the town has seen
more or less of Secret Service Agent
Brown, but no significance was at
tached to this, as nothing was confided
to the local authorities. Yesterday
Gieske was interviewed, and told point
blank that Irwin had made a confession
implicating the merchant as an accom
plice. His astonishment aud anger
knew no bounds.
"I never heard of such a thing as
HENRY C. GIESKE, a Leading San Rafael Merchant, Whom De
tectives Have Been "Shadowing."
From a Photo by Lorillard & Bratt, San Rafael.
this," he said to-day. "I never, to my
recollection, saw this Irwin. It is prob
able that he was working for a small
sentence and accused me in order to
get it.
"Many men come here for change,
and I always keep a large supply of it
on hand. For that reason I attach
no significance to strangers asking for
change. Come to think of it, no less
than tenmen I never saw before have
Seen in here for change since last Mon
day, and I have frequently, while on
the streets at night, thought somebody
was watching me. but the full foive of
the thing never struck me until I heard
yesterday what Irwin had told Brown."
Going to a private drawer, Gieske
brought forth a. small box filled with
coins of various denominations. Most
of them were plugged and one half
dollar was a counterfeit. A dollar was
placarded with the notice of a local
merchant that it woulfi be redeemed
for a larger sum in merchandise than
its face.
"I never try to pass a bad coin that
comes over the counter," said Gieske,
"but place them all in this box. They
are sold to a local jeweler. When I get
a light gold coin I take it to the sub
treasury office and have it redeemed.
I am sure nobody who knows me would
for an instant harbor the idea that I
would pass counterfeit money, but I
wish to be set right before the general
public."
Irwin's alleged confession receive? no
credence whatever in this community.
Mr. Gieske. aside from his prominence
as a merchant and politician, has never
had a blot on his escutcheon, and there
are none who are more widely and fav
orably known â  throuehout Marin
County. â¢ "- '
JACK AND TIM.
A Dog and a Parrot Kind of a Time.
Their Tricks.

affection for me by tousling my skirt,
and I feign to be alarmed at ~him, and
cry "Oh, pease don't. Jack â pease
don't'!" in baby talk, says Mrs. Char

playfully began to nip and bark at him.
With outstretched wings and feathers all

cried: "Oh, pease don't. Jackâ p ease
This dog we were compelled to name
Jack because of Tim. We had owned a
dog of the same breed apd name that was
slain by our country road trolley, and
Tim was continually saddening us by cas
ing him. It was my custom, when the
dog was out in the park somewhere, to
go to the door and call: "Here, .^v.ck*"â
whistlingâ "Here, Jack!"' occasionally
laying to myself. "Where is Jack?" This
the parrot repeated over and over, time
and again, after the deAh of the dog:
"Here Jack!"â whistlingâ "Here, Jack!
Where is Jack?" And that dog used to
run to meet the postman and bring our
mail to the house in his mouth. When
ever I heard the whistle of the poKtmarr
I would call to the dog and tell him to
tret the letter. Tim soon had the com
mand patâ "Come, Jack! Go get the let

in summer time, when he hangs in the
front or the back porch, he often causes
neighbors to run to their doors expecting

great worry of conductors, he learned
how to stop trolley cars that run near
our house. Mimicking the call of a cer

the car, he would cry. "Hey, there!â

times the conductor hurriedly signaled
the motorman, who frantically shut off
the current and put on the brakes. At
first they were quite nonplused at seeing
nobody, for they could not see Tim, be

probably would not have suspected him
if they "had seen him, so human was the

they have in common with the heroines.
They think nothing of making love to the

â¢Bulletin.MRS. MAYBRICK MAY
NOW BE RELEASED
Belief That the American Woman
Will Receive the Much-Sought
for Clemency.
NEW YORK, Jan. 29.â Another determined attempt is to be made to
secure the release of Mrs. Florence Maybriek, an American woman who
has now been ten years in an English prison charged with murdering her
husband by poison. The fight to obtain the liberty of this woman has
been long unprecedented in the history of international communications
in respect to persons convicted of capital offenses. Now, after many
failures, Miss Helen Densmore, one of the chief workers in behalf of the
prisoner, has sent this letter to the Herald:
"It is the custom of the English Home Office to revise long sentences
in the case of female convicts at the end of seven, ten, fifteen and twen
ty years. The present year is the tenth since Mrs. Maybrick's conviction,
and the reply of the Home Secretary to Dr. Clark, M. P., Mr. Davitt,
M. P., and to Mr. Dalziel, M. P., at last summer's session of Parliamentâ
viz: that he. Sir Matthew White Ridley, was aware of the strong opinion
held in America and in England as to Mrs. Maybrick's sentence, also
that she has been adequately punished â has led to strong hopes that
the ten years revision period will result in the release of Mrs. Maybriek,
which would cause much satisfaction in England as well as in this coun
try."
"Friends of Mrs. Maybriek," Miss Densmore said, "are making an
other strong effort with the British Home Secretary for her release and
it is important the people of England should feel that America takes a
great interest in hor unhappy fate."
ANXIOUS ABOUT THE NAVAL PERSONNEL BILL
NEW YORK, Jan. 29.â The Washington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: It is the understnding of members of the Senate Naval
Committee that the naval personnel bill will come up for considera
tion in the Senate during the present week.
Friends of the measure are confident of favorable action, but
they arc apprehensive that it will be loaded down with amendments which
may injuriously affect the service. It is generally understood that a number
of amendments will be introduced in the Senate, and an effort will be made
to have them attached to the bill. The department is anxious that the
measure should become law as it passed the House and without that pro
vision inserted by the Senate committee authorizing the appointment into
the service of volunteer officers who served during the war with Spain and
â who are under twenty-five years at date of appointment. As the Herald
has stated, there are 131 persons who would be eligible to such appoint
ment. It has been found, however, that if the President so chooses he can
make the provision prac ically useless. He is required to make such
appointments within two years from the date of the passage of th~ act.
There are very few recently discharged ifflcers not over twenty-five years,
and I was told to-day it would not be necessary for the President to
make more than thirty appointments, and th'>se in the lower grades.
LONG FRANKLY USES THE WORD "ALLIANCE."
L< Â»NDON, Jan. 29. â lit. Hon. Walter Hume Long, president of the Board
of Agriculture, addressing the Farmers' Club at Newcastle yesterday,
used the word "alliance" in referring to the future relations between
Great Britain and the United States. The frank employment of this term
by a member of the Government is likely to tvoke much discussion, not all
of which will be of the friendliest character, inasmuch as seeking an alli
ance to light England's battles is not regarded as the best policy to promote
an Anglo- American entente. i
Mr. Long had been discussing: the proposals to establish national
granaries, and said that "'after all and as a last resort. England's safety
depends upon having a strong navy to meet any possiV!Â» combinations
the nations coulc] bring against her." proceeded as follows: "I am glad of
cur improved relations with our American cousins, because I believe the
true meaning of that increased friendliness 's that the Americans have
realized our blood relationship and have firmly resolved that if Great Brit
ain is called to face difficulties she shall not face them alone, but in alli
ance with her wealthy and vastly populous sister country, the republic of
the United States. I am confident, seeing that the two countries are pur
suing the s.-ini.- policy and have the same ends in view, they must be friends,
firm and true to one another."
TRACK REPAIRERS RUN DOWN BY A LOCOMOTIVE.
ALTOONA, Pa., Jan. 29. â A eang of twenty-six track repairers were

Special Dispatch to Tlie Call.
PARIS, Jan. 29.â The government's ;
decision to submit to the Chamber of
Deputies to-morrow a 111 providing
tfcat the cases of trial revision shall be
brought before the united sections of
the Court of Cassation has reopened
the floodgates of the Dreyfus agita
tion. The situation appears more con
fusing and menacing than ever.
For days the anti-Dreyfusitee have
been clamoring to have the case re
ferred to the united sections, because
they have considered it certain that
among more than thirty judges they
could rely upon an anti-Dreyfusite ma
jority.
In to-day's Echo d Paris, M. Ques
nay Beaurepaire, who on January 9 re
signed the presidency of the civil sec
tion of the Court of Cassation as a
| protest against the way in which the
criminal section, under the presidency
of I. Loew was conducting the Drey
fusite proceedings, now justifies his ac
tion in a screaming screed and asserts
j that the ministers hold a decisive doeu
| ment, while M. Coppee and Jules Le
Maitre have signed a manifesto on be
half of the organization known as La
Patrie Francaise, claiming credit for
urging the government to take its pres
ent course and declaring that if the
.Dreyfus affair be once submitted to this
truly supreme tribunal it will receive
such a solutiun as will ensure the coun
try's repose.
Mr. Loew, president of the chamber.
who was asked his opinion regarding
the government's proposal, said:
"I am glad to be relieved of the re
i Bpoasibtlity, but the government's ac
tion is revolutionary."
The anti-revisionist papers are jubi
j lant, but the most serious and impartial
journals precate the government's
weakness. In all political centers to
day there has been irfTusual excitement
and activity. It is thought in some
quarters, that the Senate will refuse to
accept the bill, thus producing a con
stitutional crisis.

BEAR ON A RAMPAGE
IN AN OPERA HOUSE
Frenzied Brute Objects to an Effort
to Extract an Ulcerated
Tooth.
OMAHA, Jan. 29.â An enormous silver
tip bear, frenzied with an ulcerated tooth.
Which its master Was trying to extract,
escaped from its cage in the Creighton
Theater to-day and created a panic before
being captured. In addition to frightening
a number of persona the bear seriously
hurt its master, Paul Batty, badly lacer
ated Stagehand McDonald and tore the
clothes off Jacob Rosenthal, the manager
of the theater.
McDonald was assisting Batty to ex
tract the tooth and a crowd of men and
boys surrounded the cage of the enraged
animal to witness the operation. The
brute was fastened down with chains and
leather bands, but when the trainer
touchra the ulcerated tooth the bear
gave a roar and burst his bonds as though
they wore paper. With a sweep of lus
mighty paw he threw Batty and McDon
ald to the floor and turned upon the
crowd around the iron cage.
They lied in every direction, but the
cage was demolished in a moment. Man
ager Rosenthal was climbing into the flies
as the enraged bear passed his hiding
place. The bear made one pass at the
manager, and, catching his frock coat,
carried it completely away with him. He
also tore the shoe from one of Kosenthal's
i< el and then passed on in pursuit of the
crowd.
Jn the maze of scenery back of the
stage the bear vented his fury by de
molishing property right and left. By
this time the trainer had recovered sufn-
Clcntly to direct the heating of irons to
subdue the animal. The bear's roars could
be heard for several blocks. He was
finally driven into the cellar of the the
ater, where, surrounded by a row of red
hot irons, he submitted to being bound.
MORE CASES OF
TRICHINOSIS EXIST
TOMALES. Jan. 29. â Dr. Nief, the
County Veterinary Surgeon, and Dr. Ur
ban, the local health official, visited L ne
Conti ranch yesterday, and burned all the
remaining sausage of the lot which caus
ed the first case <-f trichinosis known to
Marin County. The ranch, which is now
under the control of one Grandi, has been
quarantined for two months. The wife
of Conti will recover, but Anzini lies in
a precarious condition, and his death is
momentarily expected.
It is stated by Dr. Nief that four more
farm hands who ate the infected Â»iork are
now lying '11 at IVtaluma. An examina
tion showed that the hog killed was the
only one having trichinosis. It was
brought* to the ranch from Sonoma Coun
ty. The official deprecates the false alarm
and flurry caused uy Conti a case, and ex
plains that just one hog- was afflicted.
This is the only animal ever known to
have been infected with this parasite in
the history of Marin County.

Kokoma in Danger of Being Carried
Away by an Avalanche,
as It """as in the
Eighties.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Jan. 29.â The snow storm
which has been raging on the mount
ains since early last week has subsided.
The sun broke through the clouds and
the wind abated to-day. In some places
the fall of snow has been the heaviest
in fifteen years. In and about Lead
ville serious results are threatened.
The supply of coal and provisions in the
smaller mountain towns has become ex
hausted, and suffering must result un
less the railroads can be opened to
these places. Snow-slides are reported
from several places, but only from
Apex, where three were killed, has
come information of casualties.
Information from Kokomo is to the
effect that great masses of hard
packed snow overhang the town,
threatening it with serious damage,
should they give way. Kokomo was
carried away by an avalanche in the
early eighties, and the residents are
fearful lest this should be repeated
now.
The South Park road has been tied up
between Como and Leadvllle for nearly
"a week. Several days ago an attempt
was made to run a train with provi
sions westward through the snow. The
train stuck near Dickey, where it has
remained ever since. A snowslide near
Hagerman tunnel on the Colorado road
has blocked that road west of Leadville
and trains to Glenvvood have srone over
the Denver and Rio (Jranrte tracks. Be
tween Como and Leadville the snow has
drifted in the cuts to the depth of thir
ty and forty feet. The only road run
ning west and east from Leadville that
has been clear is the Denver and Rio
Grande, which has felt but little incon
venience from the storm.

tions, says he will not interfere at any
time with the consideration of the
treaty by asking to have appropriation
bills taken up, and as a consequence the
treaty will have complete right of way.
This week will see the close of the
memorable debate, both in executive
session and in open debate, as the vote
is set for 3 o'clock a week from to-mor
row. Notice has been given of set
speeches for every day except Monday
of the present week. Senator Barry
will speak Tuesday, Senator Spooner
Wednesday, Senator Rawli s Thursday,
Senator Money Friday and Senator
Chilton Saturday. These peeches will
be lased upun the varii resolutions
on the general question of expansion
and will be delivered in open session.
They will, however, practically be de
voted to the treaty and will afford Sen
ators an opportunity to say openly
what they would say in secret session
if the resolutions were not under con
sideration. There will be an effort to
get the speeches in before 3 o'clock each
day in order to permit the closing of
the doors at 2 o'clock, in accordance
with the unanimous agreement to that
effect, when the treaty will be taken up
formally and the executive considera
tion of the subject proceeded with.
Senator Bacon and Senator Mason
both announce their intention of con
tinuing their efforts to get action upon
their respective resolutions before the
vote is taken upon the resolution to
ratify the treaty, and hope to succeed
some time during the week.
The friends of the treaty are still
most sanguine of success and most of
them announce that they will accept no
compromise. Others express a willing
ness to accept some such resolution as
that of Senator Sullivan. Those pro
fessing to know say it is the policy to
force the treaty to a vote before tak
ing action on any compromise propo
sition, and if the treaty should by any
chance be beaten, to move to recon
sider and then to consider the question
of accepting some compromise like the
Bacon resolution before final adjourn
ment in March. Almost a month of the
session will be left after the vote of
Monday week, so that if the Senate
should prefer to accept the treaty with
a resolution of construction and in
struction, to postponing action for an
extra session, it could do so.
Interest centers in the army bill in
the House of Representatives during
the early part of the week. The final
vote will be taken at 3 p. m. Tuesday.
Prior to this the debate will be under
the five-minute rule in the main, al
though sufficient time has been re
served to give Bailey and some of the
other leaders an opportunity for ex
tended speeches. Chairman Hull of the
military committee is confident the Mil
will pass, saying that the Republican
disaffection will not exceed ei*rht. while
several affirmative votes will come from
the Democratic side. The opposition
will direct its efforts toward having the
bill recommitted.
With the army bill disposed of. the
House will turn its attention to the
important river and harbor bill, and
then to the military academy appropri
ation bill. The river and harbor bill
probably will have Wednesday, with
two hours' debate on a side. The mili
tary academy bill is not likely to take
more time than is required to read it
through. No exact programme has
been fixed for the rest of the week,
but Chairman Merer of the Committee I
on Public Buildings and Grounds has
been pressing for a hearing on some of â¢
the public building bills now pending. '
and he is likely to get a day. Chair
man Lacey wants a day on public land
questions.
The Hawaiian bill is the most im- |
portant piece of general legislation j
which will be agreed to a hearing, al- '
though its friends may let it go over ;
until next week.
RECALLS THE HANNA
BRIBERY CHARGES
Suit Brought to Compel the Return
of Money Received by
Otis' Attorney.
CINCINNATI, Jan. 29.â Judge Dempsey I
had before him again yesterday the mo
tion to compel Colonel T. C. Campbell to
pay into court the money which it was al- '
leged was given by him last January to
Legislator Otis by H. H. Boyce, who was !
supposed to tÂ»e acting for Senator Hanna j
when the latter was a candidate. A suit |
was filed here and the attempt was made
to garnlshee the money alleged to be in
the possession of Campbell. He appeared
in court and said that the money was in
New York, where it was tied by an order
of court in suits filed there against |
Boyce, and that it could not be brought j
here without incurring the penalty of the j
court there. It was also asserted by coun- I
sel for Campbell that it was not the prop- |
erty of Boyce. but of Senator Hanna.
This was denied and it was asserted that
they could not show that the money ever ,
belonged to the Senator. Judge Dempsey
took the matter under advisement.
John C. Otis is the Republican member
of the Legislature from Cincinnati, who :
claimed a year ago to have been offered !
$1700 for his vote for Senator. Campbell is
his attorney and it was claimed that H.
H. Boyce paid the money to Campbell, i
There are some who deny the whole story, j
claiming that the money was never
turned over to any one or offered to Otis,
and suit is brought both to test the claim
that was thought to have been made for
effect on the Senatorial contest and also '
for the benefit of Boyce's creditors. The >
matter was investigated by the Legisla
ture a year ago by a committee, of which \
Vernon H. Burke of Cleveland was chair- ,
man.
OPPENHEIMEK CONVICTED.
Found Guilty of the Murder of a
Fellow-Convict at Folsom.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 29.â After being
out twenty-three hours, the jury to- '
day found Convict Jacob Oppentieim
er guilty of murder In the sec
ond degree for the killing of Charles Ross,
a fellow convict in the Folsom Prison, on
the last day of September. Two of the
jurors held out for murder in the second
degree, and the other ten, who were for
murder in the first degree, finally gave In.
The murder was a brutal one, and it
is believed that Ross was killed because
he was suspected of having been a stool
pigeon for the officers. Oppenheimer is
already serving a fifty years' term for
killing a man in the San Joaquln Valley
not long ago.
ARCHBISHOP IRELAND
VISITS THE VATICAN
Has a Conference With Cardinal
Rampolla, Papal Secretary
of State.
ROME. Jan. 29.â Archbishop Ireland,
went to the Vatican to-day, where he had
a conference with Cardinal Rampolla, Pa
pal Secretary of State. Many Cardinals
and other high ecclesiastics visited the
Archbishop at the Hotel Bristol, where he
is staying.
In the course of an interview to-day ha
declared that there was absolutely no
foundation for the statement that he had
been charged to represent the I'nited
States at the forthcoming conference re
garding the limitation of armaments. The
United States, he saiu had not yet noraj
inated a delegate. The Archbishop was
very reserved in his replies to questions
respecting religions problems in America
on the ground that it was necessary for
him to wait for the Holy See to pass upon
such matters.
DBOWNED AT MARTINEZ.
BENICIA, Jan. 29.â A clerk named Mal
colm, belonging to the general service,
was drowned to-day at Martinez, lie
came here a few days ago to assist in
making out the muster rolls for the
Eighth California Infantry. His body is
in Martinez in charge of tho Coroner.

(3N OUTBURST OF SPECULATION.
SPECULATION was the .feature of. business all
over the United States' la>t weefc, Wall street
being the center bf disturbance. It was one of
the periodical outbreaks of speculation which' occur
from time to time. When the public rush in and buy
everything in sight for no other reason than that
they think it is a good time for financial pyrotechnics.
'1 he fever to buy began with stocks and merged into
a rampant demand for wheat, which sent up the price
of this cereal at a rapid rate. The noteworthy feature
of tins movement was the avidity with which Wall
street bought wheat, for this feverish mart does not
generally run to speculation in grain. Crop condi-
I no part in this rush to buy wheat, and
rom the different centers of trade throughout
gnored by the eager purchasers. The
and elevators were quick to take advantage of
the booift, and when the price had got high enough
commenced to sell, which had the effect of checking
the advance. The s-amc condition prevailed in stocks.
The public ru>hcd in and- the professionals gave them
vanud. Conservative concerns advised
rneir ru-;r.ir,cr.- I â  r.vly; but their advice had
ffect London, too, saw its chance to turn an
penny and sold Americans freely; but the rise
went on just the same.
ther curious feature of the situation was that
in the midst of all this wild buying the money market
markably easy and Americans were actually
loaning funds to Europe meanwhile. In former years
this condition was unheard of. Whenever there was
a burst of speculation the New Yorkers went to
Europe for money wherewith to operate, and the
money market hardened at once. Herein possibly
lii- the explanation of the vast speculation of last
week. The financial centers of the United States are
known to be gorged with money, and interest rates
arc being lowered all along the line, hence the public,
teeing in current conditions a chance to make a fine
ted their funds in anything in sight that
n advance. As far as the moment was
. '.ed their judgment was certainly correct, for
tocks went up with a buoyancy to suit the
I â  vine speculator. The bank clearings re
spoi.dcd to the boom and showed a gain of 66.9 per
cc.it over the same week last year, while of the
$2,144,768,000 clearings throughout , the country
./x>,ooo was credited to the city of New York.
The clearings of Chicago, which usually leads in grain
speculation, were $139,272,000. and her gain was 56.7
per cent, while that of New York ran up to 88.8 per
cent. No important failures resulted from the boom.
and in fact those of the whole country were only 246,
- i'or the corresponding week in 1898. The
movement hi wheat kept up with the spccula
id were heavy, _ being 3.813,300 bushels from
tic ports, against 2.971,300 during the same week
last year.
While this enormous speculation has been going
on the leading commercial staples have shown- little
change. The iron trade still booms, and the heavy
s is accompanied by an advance in almost all
descriptions, with a desire for combinations which.
We are told, amounts to a virtual craze. Lumber
maintains the firm tone already noted, the dry-goods
trade reports an improvement in several Eastern
cities, railroad receipts are making surprising gains,
and the treasury receipts arc steadily increasing.
Wool alone is weak, and the Western bankers are ad-
Vistng speculative holders to sell, as quotations are
considered too high for the immense stocks on hand.
Conditions here at home show no particular change
beyond the rise in wheat. The interior valleys have
been visited by a hot north wind, which is doing no
1 the crops, and the abnormally hot weather is
sonic anxiety among fruit-growers, who fear
th?t the trees may blossom too early and get caught
I later on. It certainly is strange weather for
January. Otherwise there is little to remark in the
local situation.
There is every reason to suppose that our grand
cl.il. ren will be paying pensions arising from the
Civil War. and that by that time the total will have
to imposing proportions.
An attempt is being made to organize a Farmers'
It will not be a suotesft. Even if the farmers
gether there will be the political gold-brick
man in the midst of them.
After a Sunday at home, soothed and sustained by
the approbation of his neighbors, Speaker Wright
might to be in shape to face the ordeal the day holds
for him.
The Wyoming outfit which offers $20,000 for a fight
between Sharkey and Fitzsimmons would be wiser to
devote the sum to the raising of steers.
THE INNER CIRCLE OF CORRUPTION.
IN this State no Senatorial money has been paid
into the State treasury â not even the thirty thou
sand dollars needed to raise the credit of the can
didate from Mexico to par. Twenty thousand dollars,
supposed to have been used for Republican legislative
tickets, has been traced to one purse, but first the
closed life and next the illness of Milton J. Green
have so far prevented the itemizing of this limited
corruption account. Here and there a few hundred
dollars have been placed. A new ticket office on the
sixth floor "of the railroad building has been uncov
ered. But after all, when the investigation at Sacra
mento'ended, the Burns lobby had been almost dis
credited.
The unearned increment is the most effective ele
ment in that kind of politics that sets the faces of men
like Dan Burns toward Washington. It is more real
in itself, but even less apparent, than the unearned
increment in real estate. It eludes formalities, ac
counts and inquiries under oath. Its jingle is rarely
overheard. Its existence is solid and its sound metal
lic, but to the public ear it is as silent as the sleeping
gold in quartz pockets.
The Assembly committee at Sacramento has de
served and received credit for its use of such ma
terials as it obtained. It exposed some corruption
that struggled for or was pushed toward the light.
It fully justified the cautious and exact statements of
The Call. But, after all, it only scratched the outer
skin of Colonel Maznma and drew a few drops of
his blood. His less important operations, through
raw and inartistic agents, in some degree were ascer
tained. But the inner circle of his influence, where
experience and system work with the delicacy and
with the accuracy of a watch, was hardly touched.
It was touched, however. There is no bond of
honor, of sympathy or of genuine friendship between
conscienceless politicians and an unqualified or dis
qualified candidate for Senatorial preferment The
only tie that unites them is the unearned increment.
The manager for Ulysses S. Grant was certainly a
novice, and his urn of. money was easily unveiled. We
should not be surprised at an effort to convert Grant
into ascapegoat for Dan Burns. But the effort can
not succeed for many reasons, and chiefly and pre
cisely because, as we suggested yesterday and have
repeated to-day, the inner circle of Colonel Mazuma
was touched by the investigating committee.
The Burns artists do not wear broad-brimmed
hats and shaggy eyebrows and invite detectives to fol
low them into dark places. They are at once deft
and simple in their legerdemain. They are trained
and inscrutable witnesses, and their skill is beyond
the reach of a -brief and rapid legislative inquiry.
They can throw a net over unsuspecting integrity
with the dexterity of a Roman gladiator. The one
thing they cannot do is to hide their associations,
their faces and their odor. They are so well known to
interested and scrutinizing citizens that where they
hover conjecture hardens into fact.
The following of Dan Burns is in itself a sufficient
nrc for the people of the State, sound in
heart and sound in brain, who cannot understand how
a filthy political wave can land a political failure, with
out a single qualification, in the Senate of the United
States. Even without legal proof every one knows
the source and the character of his support. And as
we have already suggested, these generalizations were
made specific and driven home by the fall of Speaker
Wright. His quintuple relation to corruption is a
conclusive answer to the question of how Dan Burns
captured him. And that demonstration projects itself
with rational, and unerring certainty into the inner
circle, where the smell would have burst the nose of
Cyrano de Bergerac as it arrested the progress of the
Assembly committee.
The devil, it is said, marks his own. The pang
surrounding Daniel Burns, fuller of babbling integrity
than a rotten egg is of diseased meat, is marked be
yond the possibility of error. These arc the men who
require caricature to identify them with humanity.
They would be probably turned out of the lower re
gions for moral uncleanliness, but they are a pesti
lential concentration at the State Capitol.
Considering their surroundings, the legislators
who, like the venerable Judge Clough, are clean
within and wear the rugged faces of unpurchasable
integrity are almost entitled to rank as heroes, even
if some of them do thirst for journalistic blood and
seek to escape the gallery of legislative immortals.
We hope that. they may substitute right for Wright
in the Speaker's chair and sternly vindicate legisla
tive honor, but we also hope that before they destroy
the press they may avert their own destruction by de
stroying Dan Burns and by honoring the demand of
the citizens of California through the election of a
qualified Federal Senator in the person of a Repub
lican, a statesman and a gentleman.
THE ASSEMBLY ON TRIAL.
WHEN the investigating committee was ap
pointed to inquire into the charges made
against Speaker Wright and the manager of
Grant's Senatorial' campaign the accused parties were
placed on trial: when, a little later, rumors of pos
sible whitewash were circulated from Sacramento
through the State the committee itself was on trial
before the people; and now that the report has been
submitted to the Assembly and reports are current
that an attempt will be made in that body to relieve
the Speaker of the condemnation justly put upon
him the Assembly is on trial.
While the investigating committee did not uncover
all that it might have brought to light had it pursued
its examinations with more vigor, it certainly ob
tained sufficient testimony to confirm the charges
made against the Speaker, and it had the courage and
the honesty to make a straightforward report on the
subject. That report the people expect the Assembly
to sustain. If it be set aside the Assembly will be
condemned. ,
When the report has been adopted it will then be
the duty of the Assembly to go farther and mete out
to Speaker Wright the full measure of penalty his
offenses deserve. The culprit thus exposed, dis
credited, dishonored and disgraced should not be
permitted to occupy for another day the Speaker's
chair. Nor should he be permitted to remain in the
Assembly. He is unfit to represent an honorable
constituency, to legislate for California and to sit
among honest men. His official career should be ter
minated before he can inflict any further disgrace
upon the State.
The signs and evidences that have been noted at
Sacramento of a desire on the part of the Burns gang
to save the Speaker from the consequences of his
actions have increased the public indignation against
the methods of the Mexican boss. No testimony
was submitted during the investigation to show what
Inducements were given to Wright to vote for Burns,
but enough was disclosed to create a moral certainty
that he was moved by some underhand job and in
trigue; and the efforts of the Burns men to shield him
from just punishment increases the suspicion of cor
rupt collusion and strengthens the popular demand
for the expulsion of the Speaker from the Legislature.
It is time for Burns and his following to take
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 30, 1899.
warning. They have escaped by very devious paths
from the shame that has befallen their exposed, col
league, and it is by no means likely that they could
escape again if another investigation should take
place. If they are wise they will leave the Speaker to
his fate and profit by the moral of his fall.
THE PURIFIED JURY BOX.
BY something like a formal ceremony of purifica
tion by fire, Judge Daingerfield, County Clerk
Deane and Chief Deputy Goddard have cleaned
the box containing the lists of jurymen and taken
steps which justify the hope that the stuffing of the
box and the consequent packing of juries will no
longer be included among the scandals of the City
Hall.
The evil has been one of long continuance, and at
times a good deal of attention has been directed to it
by reason of some flagrant offense. While the law
requires that the names placed in the jury-box shall
be selected by Superior Judges, it has been possible
for other parties to put names in the box, and several
attempts have been made to discover persons guilty
of such stuffing, but never with any success.
Thanks to the purification and the new rules
adopted it is now likely we shall have juries honestly
selected at any rate, whatever may happen to them
afterward. The Judge, the County Clerk and the
chief deputy removed from the box all the old names,
and the slips of paper on which these were written
were then burned. When the box was thus cleaned
the newly selected names were placed in it. These
were all written by one person, in a peculiar hand
writing, and therefore it will be easily possible to
determine whether any name hereafter drawn from
the box has been forged or illegally placed there.
The cleaning out of the box and the substitution
of an entirely new lot of names written and deposited
under strict regulations and supervision is a subject
of no small importance to the community. Under
our system of government the whole social fabric
rests upon the honesty of jurymen. To them come
all questions of property, of life and of liberty. When
the jury-box is tainted with fraud the very founda
tion of our civilization is affected. The knowledge
that the jury-box has been stuffed has long consti
tuted one of the gravest of our municipal scandals,
and there is good reason for general gratification over
what has now been done to prevent any such" offenses
in future.
A MISTAKE OF THE FATHERS.
r^ OMMENTING upon the scandals which have
I arisen from Senatorial elections in various parts
of the Union, and with particular reference to
those at Sacramento, the Boston Globe points out
that the whole project of the constitution for improv
ing the personnel of the Senate by requiring the
election of its members by Legislatures instead of by
the people "has been ridiculed by a century of ex-
perience."
It is an indisputable truth that where popular
opinion governs the elections of Senators the best
men are obtained, and where the elections are
'farthest away from the people the Senate fares worst.
The Globe very justly says:
"In New England and the South, speaking gener
ally, the Legislatures choose men who would have no
reason to fear an election by the people, but it is
doubtful how much longer this standard can be main
tained under a false system. New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, In
diana, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota and Ore
gon at least have Senators who would be very re
luctant to submit themselves to the test of a popular
election and who cannot be regarded as an improve
ment upon the men whom the people of these States
choose for Governors."
It requires no elaborate review of Senatorial con
tests for a long series of years to find proof of the ac
curacy of that statement. Ample evidence can be
found in the daily reports of the elections now going
on. The most striking illustration of fraud comes
from Montana. When the legislative session opened
at Helena Senator Whitesidc announced that he had
been given $30,000 to purchase votes for W. A.
Clark, a candidate for the United States Senate, and
in proof of his assertion laid before the Legislature
thirty $1000 bills.
The Legislature ordered the money to be turned
into the State treasury and appointed an investigating
committee. The Grand Jury of the county also took
up the matter. The results of the proceedings were
telegraphed yesterday. Clark was exonerated by the
Grand Jury and Whitesidc was unseated in the Senate
by a vote made up of members of both parties.
On that showing it appears that some one con
cocted a conspiracy against Clark, and in carrying it
out put up $30,000 as evidence that he was engaged in
bribery. The fraud is as bad as if Clark himself had
been the briber, and exhibits in a striking manner the
extent to which money is used in Senatorial contests.
The State of Montana, having confiscated the roll of
$1000 bill?, is to that extent richer, but the disgrace
upon her Legislature and incidentally upon the Sen
ate of the United States is. too great to be gilded
over by all the gold leaf that amount of money could
buy, no matter how thinly it were beaten out.
There is but one remedy for these evils, which are
now so widespread and which threaten even the New
England and Southern States. The mode of
electing Senators must be changed. We must return
to the direct vote of the people.
7n a suit for recovery of damages growing out of
the lynching of Click Mitchell in Ohio the telegraph
btal es briefly that the plaintiff did not get a bean. It
is therefore plain that as a matter of speculation no
bwdy can afford to be hanged by a mob. Advices
arc meager, as the dispatches do not state who sued,
but as the lynching was a success there is hardly a
probability that it was Click himself.
Brandes and his wife want a change of venue. They
would be wise to ask that it be to China, where the
slaughter of the female is viewed with more noncha
lance than our more recent civilization has acquired.
Dennery can't be a Senator, but the blessed privi-
lege of loafing around the lobby and telling how he
loves the colonel is something which cannot be taken
from him.
When California sends people to jail for debt the
necessity for enlargement of the jails will be manifest.
Would it not be wiser to send the creditors to the
asylum?
Clark is to be the Senator from Montana after all.
Thus will virtue, backed by millions in ready cash,
win if the other fellow does not happen to have more.
Now, why should a good-looking man liko Cowan
shy at the thought of a cartoon? As to Works, and
even Johnson, the matter ft easy to understand.
The reason the oratory of Senator Shortridge has
not stirred the multitude is that the gentleman cannot
make it louder than his vest.
Some of the bills sought to be put into circulation

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Several armor clads in tfie Russian navy
are undergoing alterations, among which
the Peter Veliki, which is getting a new
turret armor and 12-lnch guns of 40 caliber
installed. The Herzog Edinburgsky has
had a new propeller put on, which u->on
trial gave a speed of 16.51 knots, against
15.2 of the old screw.
The abolition of joiner work on British
naval vessels has thrown a large number
of joiners out of employment. The dock
yard officials put some at work usually
done by shipwrights, with the result that
the latter made a demonstration, r.nd
there promises to be a lively war of the
unions against tne Admiralty.
The two most prominent torpedo-boat
builders are Thornycroft and Yarrow.
Since 1877 Thornycroit nas built 215 boats,
from 59 feet to 230 feet in length and
ranging in horse-power from 180 to SSOO.
Yarrow has built during the same period
14S boats, of from 56 feet to 220 feet in
length and horse-powers from 86 to
6000.
A robbery of $4500 to $5000 in gold from
the paymaster's cabin of the cruiser Isiobe
at Devonport is puzzling the naval author
ities, and there is not the slightest clew
for the court of inquiry to work with. It
is, believed, however, that the money was
taken in installments, and the police are
prosecuting the most searching in
quiries.
The cost of maintaining the several di-!
visions of the Russian fleet is given as
follows in roubles: The Baltic and White
seas, comprising seven stations, 2,700.328;
Black Sea, 1,863.874; Caspian flotilla, 189,
--773; Siberian fleet, 492,380; voluntary enlist
ed men, 255.350, and ships on detached ser
vice in foreign waters, 5,9*2,486, making a
total of 11.514,230 roublesâ equal to ?S,SG5>i
in American money.
The French submarine boat Gustave
Zede made a successful trip from Totiion
to Marseilles on January 9, making the
distance of about fifty miles in eight
hours, the passage being completed with
complete success, notwithstanding a very
choppy sea. M. Lockroy, Minister of Ma
rine, warmly complimented the command
ing officer, Lieutenant Mottez, and the
crew, on their successful voyage.
In the Oceanica, recently launched from
the yard of Harland & Wolff, Belfast,
Great Britain will acquire a most efficient
auxiliary cruiser. She will be able to
steam 24,000 miles in 81 days, at the rate
of 12 knots an hour, without recoaling.
The next best auxiliary cruisers, so far
as relates to coal endurance, are the Ma
jestic and Teutonic, which can steam
21.600 miles in 90 days, at the rate of 10
knots per hour, without renewing their
coal supply.
M. Lockroy, Minister of Marine of
France, has already done much toward
placing the navy in an efficient condition.
Many of the armored ships were abso
lutely worthless 6n account of their huge
superstructures, which made the ships un
scaworthy. During the past year several
of them have been entirely remodeled in
their upper works, notably the Hoche,
where the medieval castle structure has
been removed. The other ships similarly
improved are the Richelieu, Colbert, Tri
<Teht? Redoubtable. Devastation, Indomita
ble and Tonnant. Even the Massena, only
recently completed, has some changes in
her superstructure and armament.
The London Times of December 27 has
a one column summary of Secretary-
Long's report on the navy of the United
States. The Times' comments are very
complimentary to the navy and Secretary
Long, remarking: "Mr. Long's report is
thoroughly interesting and admirably cal
culated to instruct and appeal to an edu
cated public opinion. As Sir Veasy Hamil
ton has lately pointed out, the advantage
of such lucid and frank statement is de
nied to Parliament and the British peo
ple." Commenting on Mr. Long's recom
mendation of a new system of reward for
merit for naval officers, the Times says:
"Does this presage the establishment of
orders and decorations in the great re
public?"
During the agitation on flogging in the
British army some years ago a society
was formed, called the Anti-Flogging
League. In November last the secretary
of this society wrote to the Admiralty
concerning an alleged severe flogging of
a youth on the training ship Boscawen,
said to have greatly affected the culprit's
health. The Admiralty investigated the
case, and under date of January 9 in
formed the Anti-Flogging Society that
there is no flogging in the navy, and that
birching as a punishment is confined en
tirely to boys of a certain age, and i 3
never inflicted except according to reru
lation and by warrant signed by superior
authority. To the proposition made by the
BOClety that dark cells, with bread and
water, be substituted for flogging, the
Admiralty was of the opinion that such
punishment would be entirely too much
for boys for whom disciplinary measures
of a prompt kind and less likely to in
jure health were preferable.
BOARD OF EDUCA
TION ECONOMY
Editor Call: Why does the Board of!
Education have so much to say about !
economy forcing them to get teachers out
of the department? Why not acknowl
edge that they are prompted solely by po
litical oi- selfisn motives of their own?
Although they have been in office less
than a month, they have caused tne
schools to be infested with a horde of
idle workmen, who wander aimlessly
around, hanging curtains that are never
used, fitting keys in rusty locks that are
not needed and patching knotholes in the
fences. If this sort of thing continues,
the teachers will all have to vacate in a
body and leave the schools to the work
men and their friends on the school board.
The last board, when they wont into of
fice threatened to wipe out all the ap
pointees of their predecessors, and preach
ed reform, etc.. with what result we all
know. Does the present board intend to
emulate their example and consolidate
and retrench, only to have more money
in the school fund for so-called "re
pairs?" Can any one explain why teachers
are being quietly placed in vice-principal
ships without even the formality of an
election, while others are being abol
ished? Why is a gentleman holding Mr.
Marks' position at the Everett School
who has not been publicly appointed as
such?
The teachers will have cause to be
thankful if the adoption of the new char
ter will relieve them from the tyranny of
twelve inexperienced, merciless men who
rush- into office every two years so eager
for spoils that they are ready to take the
scalp of any one who stands in their way.
Their actions upset the entire School
Department and jeopardize . its useful
ness. Every one in the department real
izes by this time what empty mockery
this "reform and economy" is, --so why
keep up this senseless parade of virtue
before the public when no one believes in
it? AT. WAIN WRIGHT,
San Francisco, Jan. 29, 1899.
THE CANDIDATE
AND THE SMILE
To the Editor of The Call-in your edi
torial columns this morning under the
caption "Hastening the Millennial Dawn"
you refer to Assemblyman Caminetti as
either a joker or a joke because he has
introduced into the Assembly a bill to pro
hibit candidates bribing or attempting to
bribe voters With whisky, cigars, etc.
You do not refer to the practice as brib
ery, but it is certainly nothing else. When
a candidate enters a saloon, announces
himself as a candidate and invites those
present to drink or smoke at his expense,
he does it with the hope of influencing
them to vote for him, just as surely as
though ho were distributi ng double
eagles among them. To be sure, he does
not exact a pledge to do so. but it is not
the exacting of pledges, but the offering
of "considerations" that constitutes brib
ery.
The proposed legislation Is not some
thing new and unheard-of, as you seem
to think. You say, "When such a state of
morals exists as will permit a candidate
to wage a campaign without buying a few
cabbage leaves and 'smiling' with his
friends there will be no need of any law
on the matter for the millennium will be
here and drinking and smomng will have
become things of the past.'" A law similar
to that proposed has been in force in Can
â  ada for many years, and yet drinking and
smoking are by no means "things of the
pagt." But the "whisky campaign" is de
cidedly a "thing of the past," tnanks to
the aforesaid law.
I agree with you that the bill, if passed
as at present drafted, will probably not
be properly enforced, but that is no rea
son why It should be voted down. It
should rather bo amended by adding to
the penal clauses one providing that con
viction of the BUCcessiul candidate of the
infraction of any of the provisions of the
bill shall disqualify the candidate and
void the election; or, better still, prive the
office to his opponent, provided he is not
shown to have broken the law in his can
vass. This will make it to the interest of
every defeated candidate to show, if pos
sible, that the law has been violated by
the successful one, and so make the law
virtually self-operative,
If such an obviously necessary and ben
eficial law as this cannot be enforced in
ihis State, we may as well paraphrase the
oft-quoted sentiment and say that our
government is ot the saloon, by the saloon
and for the saloon. J. E. HUGHES.
Crockett, Jan. 28, 1899.
THE BARBERS'
PROPOSED LAW
Editor Call: The interest taken by your
paper in regard to sanitary measures, as
applied to barber shops, prompts us to in
form your readers in general and the bar
bers in particular that Assembly Bill 119â
an act to regulate barbering, intended to
insure the better education of such practi
tioners in the State of Californiaâ was in
troduced at the request of the Barbers'
Association of the Pacific Coast, who held
an open meeting December 18, 1898, when
it was decided unanimously to declare in
favor of such a law as Assembly JiUJ 119.
Similar laws are in force in Eastern
States and there operate admirably well,
both to the public and barbers, benefiting
those who desire improvement and injur
ing the ones that are degenerating, so we
see by the official report of the Barbers'
State" Board of Examiners of Minnesota,
made, to their Legislature.
Our Barbers' Association hasl members
in nearly every town in this State. Those
of Los Angeles send a petition of over
300 to the Legislature, and in this city
the proprietors of the following barber
shops, who favor the proposed legislative
enactment, are: Mr. Bernhard of the
Palace, Mr. Lanber.heimer of the Grand,
Mr. Lippert of the Occidental, Mr. Green
berg of the Safe Deposit, Mr. Finney of
the Merchants' Exchange and 783 others,
including the journeymen. Believing this
matter to be of public interest, you will
please give it space in your valuable
paper. W. C. SEPPICH,
Chairman Legislative Committee.

HAS EVERY MAN HIS PRICE P
Dr. Locke Discourses on Salable and
Unsalable Men.
Dr. Charles Edward Locke's subject at
the Central Methodist Episcopal Church
last evening was "Wanted, Men! Has
Every Man His Price?" Dr. Locke said
in part:
"The pessimistic Elijah, the lachrymose
Jeremiah and the doughty Diogenes have
started a cry which needs to be taken up
by this fin de slecle period. 'Run ye to and
fro and see if ye can find a man. 1
"Civilization in any age is but the in
crease of manhood. Nations have grown
when they could produce men, but have
declined as manliness has disappeared.
"Woe be to that nation whose mothers do
not bear men! National history is but
the achievements of men. Grecian his
tory is the story of Pericles and Socrates;
Roman history tells of Cicero and Julius
ax, and so in modern history the
biographies of Gladstone and Lincoln will
include the great achievements of Eng
land and America.
"The first and final purpose of Chris
j tlanity is the Inculcation of manliness.
Jesus of Nazareth was the manliest of
men. Growth in good is but a growth in
manliness. True religion is known by the
strong characters which it builds. Many
; good men vindicate the claims of the gos
i pol of Jesus in their honorable and blame
i less lives. Such are the men which are
wanted to-day and needed in abundance.
"Haa eVery man his price? let me ask.
â  I believe Horace "Walpole's libelous wail,
[ which was the affirmative answer to this
I question, has many notable exception.-:.
George Jones, as editor of the New York
Times, was offered $f>.000.000 by the Tweed
ring if he would suppress and simply de
j cline to publish certain damaging in-
I formation, but he spurned the gift; Abra
i ham Lincoln could not be bought, and by
his rigid adherence to principles of in
tegrity gained for himself the homely but
i honorable and immortal sobriquet of
! "Honest Old Abo." Knox and Savonarola
j and Patrick Henry could not he bought,
'< and with a host of others are described in
i the lines of our own Lowell:
I honor the man who is willing to sink
I Half his present repute for the freedom to
think.
And when he has thought, be his cause strong
or weak.
Will sink the other half for the freedom to
"But alas! how humiliating the con
fession that must be made. Some men
do, indeed, have tneir price. And some
of these who can be bought are residents
of our own State, and have been chosen
to places of trust. Can anything be a
sadder comment upon the base corruption
of modern political methods than the re
cent revelations which have shriveled the
Speaker of the Assembly into a moral
Liliputian? And while he Is receiving his
deserved punishment for his reprehensible
and utterly sinful actions, let it not be
R rotten that he is, in a Sense, the scape
t for a multitude of notoriously cor
: men. He is the logical sequence of a
c and basely wicked system which
should be fiercely denounced and re
pudiated by all good citizens, namely the
use of large sums of money to secure
election to places of honor. No man
ought to. be elected to the United. States
Senate from California who has pur
chased his seat by a lavish expenditure
of money.
"Our citizenship should arise en masse
and denounce these diabolical methods of
bribery- The result is, of course, that the
most honorable men will not become can
didates. Many of the noblest citizens are
men without means, and an honest man
will not barter his birthright of integrity
for the most distinguished position of
honor in ,the gift of the people.
"It Is to be confidently hoped and
ardently desired that some man will be
elected by the present Legislature whose
moral life will be without reproach. Oh,
that some upheaval of moral sentiment
would startle our legislators into such a
discharge of their duties as will preserve
our magnificent State from, being repre
sented by any man whose hands have
been full of bribes or whose life has been
defiled with rascality and corruption! Let
moral lepers be driven* without the gates
and not sent to the United States Senate.
"Politics will never be cleansed until
men who cannot be bought shall seize the
reigns of government."
LARGE CROWDS VISIT

WARM WEATHER BitINGS OUT
THE CITY PUBLIC.
Minor Accidents on the Roads to tho
Beach â Exercises in Perspiration
and Other Amusements for
Pleasure-Seekers.
The warm weather drew long strings
of people to the Park and CJiff yesterday.
Every avenue and green in the city'=Â»
pleasure ground was packed with men,
women and children. The hottest part of
the day was shortly after noon, when the
mercury registered 72 degrees.
It kept at this temperature for some
time, forcing the pedestrians into the
shade of trees and the "bikers" to the
faucet. The fat men shed perspiration
and the lean did the same out of pure
envy. One "biker," who outweighed
everything else on the Park and Cliff
bicycle line, lost his pedals at the head
of the speed track and landed in a heap
a mile below. He was not injured seri
ously and refused to give his name.
The big crowds on the beach and the
hill to the Cliff were startled out of their
repose about 3 o'clock by a wild runaway
horse The occupants of the rig were un
injured, hut not BO much can be said for
the harness and buggy, both of which,
were carried in pieces to the Park Police
Station.
At the Chutes over 4000 people passed
through the gates.

will disappear by being first well rubbed
with a salve of pure acetic acid and lard'
then with a solution of potash and finally
with hydrochlorir add. A person not used

DROVE HEAD ON
INTO A CAR
MD. HOWELL, and C. H. Wilson
were driving rapidly down the
grade on Bryant street, between
1 Second and Third, last evening,
and they ran head on into an eastbound
street car. The horse was knocked
down and the men thrown from the
buggy, but by the greatest good luck
neither was fatally injured. Wilson's
scalp was badly torn and he was stunned
by the fall on the cobblestones. His
wound is painful, but not serious. How
ell received a bad shaking up and was un
conscioua for several minutes. His in
juries, however, consist only of a few
bruises and a general soreness about the
chest and arms.
In the usual unaccountable manner the
THE MARIA KIP
ORPHANAGE IS
CONSECRATED
Closing Work of the
Episcopalians.
HOME NOW FREE OF DEBT
FOUR BISHOPS ASSISTED IN THE
CEREMONY.
Lady Managers Presented a Beauti
ful Silver Cross to Sister
Anna â Post Conven
tion Services.
Many of the distinguished clergymen
who attended the Episcopalian convention
last week remained in the city yesterday
to participate in several post-convention
ceremonies. While these services were not
a formal part of the convention work they
wore incidental to it and were in the na- '
ture of commemorative celebrations. The .
consecration of tne Maria Kip Orphanage !
was the most important and Impressive
ceremony of the day.
I^ast evening Lord Bishop Perrln of
British Columbia preached at Trinity, and j
a united service, at which Bishop Leonard j
of Utah presided, was held at the Cathe
dral Mission of the uood Samaritan, Sec
ond and Folsom streets. The latter wna
wholly choral. The consecrations at the j
Kip Orphanage were especially interest- i
ing because yesterday was the forty-fifth
anniversary of the arrival of Bishop Kip
In San Francisco. In his short address
Bishop Nichols contrasted the conditions
Of the church when Bishop Kip began his
labors here and those of to-day.
"When Bishop Kip sailed through the
Golden Gate on that Sabbath morning j
forty-five years ago," said his Grace, "he
had no thought that upon the barren sar.d
nill would one day be erected a beautiful
home for orphans which would bear thÂ«
name of his beloved wife. But the char
itable women of the city have built this
Shelter, and with God's blessing upon it it
will endure forever."
The- orphanage is now free of debt and I
the collection yesterday is the nucleus of â 
an endowment fund whica the trustees
are now seeking to raise for the mainten
ance of the Institution.
The consecration ceremony was made :
Impressive by tne presence of four blsti
ops of the Episcopal church and a large |
number of the clergy. Delegations ironni
each paiish in the city were also present.
The services began at 3 o'clock and lasted
over an hour. After the invocation >jish
op Nichols spoke for a few minutes and
wan followed by Lord Bishop Perrin of '
Victoria, who talked to the children.
Bishop Leonard of Utah asked the bene- :
diction, and tho service closed with the
doxology by the assemblage. During the
consecration the children of the orphan- |
age sang several hy;nr.s.
Just before the audience dispersed Blsh- ;
op Nichols, on behalf of tr.e lady man- j
agers of the orphanage, presented a beau- i
tif ut silver cross to Sister Anna, the man
ager of the home.
The clerffy who participated in the ser
vice were: Bishop Nichols of California,
Bishop Leonard of Utah, Bishop More- ;
land of the Sacramento diocese. Lord
Bishop Parrln of British Columbia find
Revs. Drs. Foute. Spauldinn. MeClure,
COoke. Shaw. San ford. Kip. Church, Par
rott and Riley. There are now US r iris at
the orphanage.
Bishop Nichols last evening reviewed
the work of the Episcopalian convention
just closed in these words:
"The convention was most satisfactory i
to us all. Very little time was spent on
unimportant matters, and the real church
work was entered into with good spirit. '
(if course, our convention was almost
wholly routine, but aside from the formal
proceedings therewere many pleasant and
profitable Incidents to relieve the monot
ony, if there was any. A memorable event
Indirectly connected with the convention
T\ns tbe consecration of Bishop Morelacd.
"The most important specili. work done
was the changing of San Joaquin County
from t'nt San Francisco convocation to the
convocation of San Joaquln. Reports of
missionaries throi ghout the State were
. :ul In tone, in spite of the narrow
conditions produced l>\ the drought and
other misfortunes which afflicted tbe
good people of the interior. The future of
our church is brighter than ever, and the
clergy who attended the convention re
turn to their respective Beids of labor
wit-h renewed vigor and courage."

horse got under the car after the col
lision and it was necessary to lift one end
of the car and push it back to release the
kicking animal from its peculiar imprison
ment. Another strange circumstance is
that the only damage to the buggy is a
broken shaft, file end of which tore
through the skin on the side of the horse,
making a wicked-looking wound. The rig
belonged to Cole, the Third-street livery
man. The front end of the car was
smashed in.
The accident was wholly due to the
carelessness of the man driving the
horse. He bad ample room to turn out.

full speed at the time, and the motor

the rig would get out of the car track.

CONVEI. 2ION OF ST. PAUL.
The Rev. Father McCorry 't- Sermon at
St. MaryV Church.
The Rev. Father McCorry delivered a
stirring sormnn last evening to a large
congregation at St. Mary's Church on the
conversion of St. Paul. "Saul: Saul! why
persecuteth thou me?" was the text se
lected by the reverend father for the oc
casion.
"Damascus is still a city to-day," he
said, "with a population of over 130,000,
but in the days of St. Paul it was the
grandest city in existence. St. Paul was
hurrying there to do all in his power to
persecute the Christians, kill all of them
he* could and throw the rest into dark
dungeons. He had almost reached the
end of his journey, Damascus was in
sight, when suddenly fi->/m the heavens
comes a burst of light and behind it
Jesus appears and in a loud voice ex
claims: 'Saul! Saul! why persecuteth
thou me?' St. Paul is thrown to the
ground from his horse, but when ho arises
he is a different man. and whereas before
he was the greatest enemy of the Chris
tians he now becomes the greatest cham
pion of Jesus.
"The first lesson we Wirn from the
conversion of St. Paul Is that God speaks
to us and that we should answes and
obey him when he calls us. Secondly, you
hear people of to-day say that religion is
only good for women and children. Tf a
man with such a great mind as St. Paul
had become converted surely we should.
Finally no doubt St. Paul had heard of
Jesus and also of his great kindness.
Possibly some friend of his had been
healed from slcknes through Jesus or St.
PatU might have been given a description
of Jesus' death by one who was present
and really knew that Jesus was the son
of God, and only wanted a word from
Jesus to bid him follow him."
GIBBS STRICKEN
WITH PARALYSIS
A SLIGHT ATTACK CAME SUD-
DENLY FRIDAY NIGHT.
His Physician Says Quiet and Rest
Will Bring a Complete
Recovery.
J. D. Gibbr., the promoter of prize fights,
was stricken with a slight paralytic
stroke Friday night and is now at home
confined to his bed. His condition is so
far Improved, however, that the attend
ant physician, Dr. Thorn, presages a
speedy recovery.
On Friday Olbbs first noticed the
change In his condition, but deeming it
lemporarj , neglected medical treatment.
On Friday night the shock came, affecting
his left side. The following day he con- '
suited his physician and fainted away in
his presence. He was taken to his home
at once.
The friends of the well-know match
maker have been solicitous about hl.s con
dition and will be pleased to hear that
his illness Is not so serious as was lirsi
reported. Dr. Thorn expects to have his
patient on tho street in a few days.
ABOLISHING CHURCH TAXES.
Example Set by Artaxerxes, Pagan
King of Babylon.
I At the Hamilton-square Baptist Church
! on Post street, near Stelner, Rev. W. E.
Jenkins preached a sermon in which he
advocated the passage of the bill ex- ;
cniptins the taxation of churches r.ow i
pending in the Legislature. He very aptly
1 took for his text the order of Artaxerxes,
KinK of Babylon, exempting the captive
â  Israelites from taxation as they were re
turning home to distant Jerusalem to re
build their temple.
Dr. Jenkins argued that if the idola
trous Persian monarch could abolish tne
Government taxes of his captives an.,
permit them to depart a free people i-ora
his realms, could not a Christian Govern
ment lift the same burdens from the im
poverished Christian churches?
The Christian population of a State is
not bard to govern, he said. "Not very
much public money is expended on the
keeping of the law among church mem
bers. The jails are not Oiled with a Chris
tian class. Christianity maintains the i
peace. The religious faith of this country
has made and upholds the 'lovernment. \
It Is the duty of the State to remove I
every obstruction from the propagation
of Christian precepts. The State owes'
this to Itself. The pagan Persian has set '
California an example.
The churi h dues not ask that Its prop- I
; erty he exempted from taxationâ only

VALUABLE BOOTY RECJVERED
THREE OF THE DESPERATE
GANG ARE BROTHERS.
Detectives Ryan and O'D^a Also Ar
rest a Chinaman to Whom
They Sold Their
Plunder.
Through the efforts of Detectives Ryan
and ODea four of the most desperate
burglars that ever operated in this Â§tty
are behind prison bars. They were ar
rested at an early hour yesterday morn-
Ins and taken to the City Prison. Three
of the pans are brothers. Their names:
are Pat. Albert and O. J. Danis, all of
whom are well known to the police. Their
accomplice is William Green, who recent
ly graduated from the Reform School at
lone.
When taken into custody Green and Pat
Danis. who is known as "Black Pat, had j
In their possession three murderous look- I
Ing revolvers, several knives and a miscel
laneous assortment of skeleton keys.
During the past few weeks the men
have committed at least a dozen burglar
ies. So bold were their operations that
nearly the entire detective force was put
on their track, but the burglars managed
to elude them.
Several days ago Detectives Ryan and
] ODea of the Southern station found sev
â  eral hundred dollars' worth of stuff that
i had been stolen by the quartet, and after
obtaining only a meager description of
i them started out to find them.
It was not until yesterday morning that
their efforts proved successful. Pat
Danis and his brother, Albert, were dis
covered in a lodging house at 17 Howard
street. The detectives, knowing the dcs- |
perate character of the men. promptly
covered them with their revolvers, after
ordering them to throw up their hands.
! Realizing that resistance was futile they |
promptly obeyed the command and sub
. mltted to arrest.
| Green was found in a lodging house at
j Pacific and Stockton streets, engaged in
' smokng opium.
He attempted to reach for his revolver
when the detectives entered his room, but j
', \v;?s quickly seized and handcuffed. O. J. '
, Danis was' found In a saloon on Third '
! street. He offered no resistance and was
at once taken 1 to the City Prison.
On January 13 the quartet of burglars
1 entered the Maybell House at Grove
i street and Van Ness avenue, through the [
basement, and breaking into the room oc- !
cupied by Mrs. it.'iuon, the proprietress,
and her "two daughters, got away with a
large quantity of wearing apparel. On ,
the following day they drove up to the !
residence of Mrs. Lowell at 1221 Mission ;
street, in a wagon, and forcing an en- i
trance to the house stole a trunk contain
ing about i*>o worth of dress goods and
other wearing apparel. They placed the
trunk in their wagon and drove to a lodg- ,
ing house at HHB Folsom street, where I
i they broke it open. Subsequently they j
| sold the content* of the trunk to a second
' hand dealer on Folsom street.
On January 24 they visited a store kept
by Mrs. Dorman at 139 Third street, and |
I while two of them engaged the proprie
-1 tress in conversation Green inserted his
hand in the show case and stole eight
watches and five gold rings. A short trme ;
\ afterward they worked a similar trick on j
I Mrs. Tannebaum, who conducts a pawn
Bhpp at 21" Third street, getting away
with nine watches and several gold rings.
The men are also accused of entering the ;
Hotel Stewart, at Kills and Leavenworth ;
' streets, and stealing four valuable over
coats wheh they sold to a second-hand
dealer on Howard street. There are a
â  number of other burglaries which the po- I
lice say were committed by the gang.
Ryan and ODea have recovered a large i
portion of the property stolen by the prls- j
oners. They found the watches which I
were taken' by the thieves from the two
i stores on Third street, in a Chinese pawn
shop on Stockton street. The proprietor
of the store was arrested and charged
with receiving stolen property. The de
tectives also recovered a trunk, which
' contains a silk waist, with one sleeve un
â¢ finished; two drosses, three silver knives.
live silver forks and several spoons. They
| would like to find the owner of the trunk. I
Since January 17 Ryan and ODea have i
arrested thirteen burglars, a record of |
which they justly feel proud.

RUSKIN AND RELIGION.
Rev. William Racier Lect-.res to a
Large Audience.
A lecture by Rev. William Ruder on
; "Ruskln and Religion" catUKd all the
seats to be tilled at the Third CongTtffa
! tional Church last evening. The discourse
was a scholarly analysis of Ruskin's style
and quality, testifying tho speaker's ap
preciation of the artist-writer's work.
Art in music, painting, sculpture and
literature was provisionally defined as the
reproduction of nature with the added
i portrayal of nature's soul.
"No man," MMd the speaket. "is a true
artist who dees not set' in what he studies
I something of the purpose of the Creator.
I This quality is manifest in all of Ruskin's
! work. To him a yellow primrose by the
river's brim could teach lessons of
wondrous things, and the fossil animal
culae in a piece of chalk could tell the
! story of creation.
! â¢"Ruskin's clear and piercing mental
i vision, his marked personality, freedom
from conventional forms and absolute in
dependence or Intellect wen- doubtless
largely if not entirely due to the facts
that in hi? infancy and childhood he had
! scarcely any companions but his father
1 and mother. Themselves persons of .Â«u
--; pertor intellect, they led him from the
i t'sual vagaries of youth into channels of
| thought that are customarily followed
1 by mature minds."

CELEBRATION
OF THE FEAST
OF ST. PAUL
Impressive Services
at St. Mary's.
SERMON BY REV. C. A. RAMM
solemn high mass said by
father doherty.
Mozart's Great Composition Chanted
by an Augmented Cnoir Un
der the Direction of Miss
Georgiana.
The feast of t. - conversion of St. Paul,
the patronal feast of the Paulist com
munity, was solemnly and Impressively
! commemorated yesterday at St. Mary's
| Church. People from all parts of the city
I flocked to the church to attend the an
| nual services In honor of one of the great
est saints of the Catholic church. The
services were begun with the celebration
of solemn high mass at 11 o'clock by Rev.
Francis Brooke Doherty, C. S. P.. assist
ed by Rev. J. MacCorry as deacon and
Father Thayer as sub-deacon; Rev. vV.
Hopper assisted as master of ceremonies.
immediately after the first gospel an elo
quent panegyric was pronounced by i^ev.
C. A. Ramm of St. Mary's Cathedral.
He paid the highest tribute to the patron
saint, citing his life work and struggles
in behalf of God and his fellow man, and
outlining vividly his characteristics, both
mental and physical. The reason why j
God undoubtedly singled out St. Paul to j
fulfill the mission of converting the Gen
tiles and teaching them his gospel was
given briefly.
"It was his sympathy that was the key
note to his inlluence," said the preacher.
"By it he won the hearts of men and ful
filled the mission that God inspired w.th
in him.
"Paul's adaptability for his work," he
continued, "was a result and consequence
of natural gifts. He combined with a
transcendent pity the love of man. He
had that faculty of spreading the doc
trihos and teachings of the church, and at
the .same tin c â¢â¢ walking among men as
â¢â¢n ; of itiem. In fact, a true conception of
his character can be had when we say.
ti.'t he was Intensely human. He loved
iiiankind as much as he did himself. From
these traits you can clearly see why God
i ti"se at d â¢ ngled him out to spread his
gospel among those indisposed to accept
it â¢ r antagonistic to ft. He knew tue
work, and knew, consequently, the prej
udice the heathen world had against
Christianity."
The speaker dwelt at length on the pi
ety, energy and ability of Paul, declaring
that his successors were posse?sed of tne
same ciualit ; es. He sp-Â»t. of (he primary
and original object of these successors of
their illustrious founderâ that of con
verting unbelievers to the true faith.
"The gift of faith," he said, "is more
than a gift to us; it is a sacred trust.
Every man who lives in the true faith
should be actuated by the ambition to
bring other souls within the true fold that
they might share the same happiness and
glory in the world to come. We must
diffuse God"s light and spread his faith.
By this, our endeavor to bring souls
within the pale of our teachings and our
doctrines, let no man wrongly under
stand that the Catholic church wants and
is earnestly striving to gather together as
many converts as possible simply for Its
own interest.
"In conclusion 1 would say let us go
about the world as Paul did, doing good
to our fellow mon and spreading his
teachings and his gospel in their inter
ests. The conclusion that we must all
come to is that We must guide people,
and in order to do this we need some man
from God."
Mozart's Twelfth Mass was chanted by
an augmented choir undf-r the direction of
Orgftnlst Miss Georgiaiia. In addition to
the organ accompaniment, there was in
strumental music by the orchestra from
the California Theater, under the direc
tion of its leader, Professor Eugene
Schmitz.

breaking *ta.kL was run through without
a hitch.
â  'Yesterday was an ideal day for specta
tors. Five thousand availed themselves
of the opportunity of witnessing the <.\
--citing sport. They were not disappointed.
They saw two of the longest courses ever
run at Ingleside. The hares were in me
fettl< . and ive their natural enemies
plenty of exercise.
â  Dean's Bpeedy Connemara and Rathbc >
were slipped to a '"jack" from tnc wilds
of Kern County. The dogs chased tneir
prey up and down the lielu for live nnn
utes and twenty-on< seconds amid the
t-houts of encouragement fr<jm the packed
grand stand and betting ring. At the
completion of the run both dogs dropped
from sheer exhaustion. This was repeated
some time later, when Fox Kenny and
Brutus trailed lull speed after a "jack"
Tor four minutes and live seconds. .Both
dogs closely followed their tricky prey
with determination, and the "jack," ree-
Ing there was no hope to escape, gave up
the battle and was crunched between the
jaws of his relentless pursuers. Conne
mara and Fox Kenny, tne winners in t..e
above courses, were withdrawn by their
humane owners.
The form displayed by Mr. Deckelman's
entries redounds to the credit of his train
ers, Geary and Kellogg. The dogs ani
bitches entered showed up well in every
round and earned fame and coin for their
masters and trainers. The work of Mira
Monte, the runner-up to his victorious
kennel mate Rocket, was greeted with ap
plause by those present. His tremendous
drives and snappy pickups bordered on
the sensational.
Betting, as is usual, was extremely
heavy. Favorites enjoyed good fortune
during the entire day. Shortenders landed
at various times, but not with enough fre
quency to bring forth the shouts of toy
from those who played them.

TOD SLOAN WOULD SHOOT,
BUT HE HAD NO OPPONENT
Tod Sloan, the hope and pridp of sporting "Lunnon." right bower to Lord
Bereaford Bad pal of the Prince of Wales, has been "trim down," robbed of an
opportunity to further glorify hta name. Yesterday morning at an early hour
t: â  awakening world was expectant and glad that it was not yesterday or to
morrow but "to-day," for "to-day" Sloan was to face the traps, and as his
me gun. a token of esteem from the Prince of Princes, barked its dead
ly salutation and bleeding pigeons fell trembling to the earth, he was to win an
other title, that of champion wing shot of the turf. But to gain such a title
one must nest him who holds it. or claims that he is capable of bearing the
champion. There was the rub.
Bookmaker Coleman. who met with defeat at the hands of Sloan a week
or so ago. had arranged another match with Tod. by which they were to shoot
100 birds, the winner to carry off a prize of $250. The match was booked for Sun
day morning at 10 o'clock. At the hour set the Olympic Gun Club grounds were
still deserted. About noon Sloan, carrying the royal gun. put in his appearance.
He look Coleman, but the "hookey" was non est. Sloan shot a
dash of saliva from between his teethâ one of his habitsâ batted his eyesâ
another noticeable habitâ and remarked that he must have been bamboo dream
ing when he failed to demand the deposit of a forfeit. So he cuddled his â¢ little
self in a chair and mused, all the while hoping against hope that the bright day
would yet bring Coleman forth, but Coleman aid not come.
Soon Ted mingled in the gathering throng and a handicap match was ar
ranged. That blasted British gun fooled Tod in a feellngicss manner. From the
first it refused to hurl th.^ little leaden missies into the quivering flesh of the
startled pigeons, but as a rule far beyond the Hying object a clod of dirt would
leap into the air as though a miniature torpedo had lifted it heavenward. That
gun was choked so hard that the charge of shot hung together like a ball of
mud and Tod was handicapped. Tod also blamed the cap he wore, why he didn't
explain, and. yawning, said that loss of sleep had wrecked hie nerves, sapped his
strength and barred him as a gunner.
In the first five-bird match Sloan winged 2. Ed Fay centered his 5, C C.
Mansfield 4. Charles Dwyer 4 and E. Gains 5. Tod was trailer in this match, but
he braced up for another effort. A twelve-bird match was proposed, and the
guns were soon barking again. Sloan captured five out of the dozen, Fay killed
all cleanly and without depending on his second barrel, Mansfield winged 9,
Dwyer 11, Gains S, C. F. Ireland 11 and "W. Seidenberg 9.
Again Sloan was trailer, but he maintained his nerve until John N. and Jim
X.. the twin brothers of General Shafter. the hero of Sanitago. put in an ap
pearance, and John, who never practiced shooting at Spaniards and had no gun
of royal lineage, put Tod out. Then Tod objected with himself, but he did not
say so, and the day closed. Tod not a champion but a victim of cruel fate.
â¢As I don't go to the track any more." said Tod. "I don't think I will see
Colemai> this week, but if I do we will shoot that match."
The "we will" was uttered with emphasis, so Coleman beware, you're being
pursued.

At Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 2^.â The cours'ng
at Agricultural Park was considerably
above the average, and the large crowd in
attendance witnessed a great day's sport,
though the latter part had to be hurried,
owing to a heavy fog, which drifted in
during the afternoon. The hares ran
strong throughout the day. and in several
courses extra dogs had to be turned into
the field to save those in the course. This
was notably the case of the Stella B-Lady
Napoleon course ia bye'), when three ex
tra dogs were turned loose, and even thÂ»i
the rabbit would have escaped had it not
run into the fence. The programme was
a 40-dog stake for a $200 purse.
Pat Malloy. the San Francisco dog re
cently purchased by Frank Paaaons. won
first money, with Passons' Fleetwood sec
ond and Stella P> third. Slella B had a
good chance until she was Killed oft by
THE INKSTAND
WAS NOT SOLD
T TX the beginning this was merely the narrative of an inkstand. The sub
-5 I ject in question did not promise any Interesting developments, but as time
q I passed by and the inkstand began to unfold its history, personages of local
<Â£. â¢*â¢ renown, to say nothing of a dead President and a distinguished foreigner,
Q became connected with the rather battered ornament, until a story of a pock
+. et depleted by fast living unfolded itself. It is the same old tale that has
6 been told more than once in this land, only in this instance the inkstand
X turned out to be an imposter.
O When only a short while ago Madame Barrios -returned to this country,
â¦ there came with her a friend who may for convenience be called Jones.
O He was not a stranger to California. At one time he was the clerk to the
+ Guatemalan Consul. Jones is a Spaniard and was educated in Salvador. He
O is young, handsome, and distinguished looking. He once resided here at the
4- residence of ex-President Barillas. Like all distinguished foreigners, Jones
O went the pace that burns up very rapidly the yellow gold. He frequented the
+ race courses here and in Guatemala, and at night it is said that the cold bot-
O ties and small birds in conjunction with fair lady friends helped to make in
â¦" roads on the finances of the young man. When he landed here a short time
O ago he approached Interpreter Rebus of the Palace and made known to him
X that he was in need of money. His ancestral jewels, he said, were in pawn,
X but he exhibited to the interpreter a massive inkstand of unique and horsey
0 design, which he said was a present to him from the late President Barrios.
Â£ The Inkstand in question, he said, had been given to tho ill-fated President
p by the Jockey Club of Guatt-maU. Tnis rare and costly gift Jones was willing
X to part with for the consideration of $125.
Q Rebus took the ornament with a view of selling it. Charley Fair. Tom WIII
-q iams, Walter S. Hobart and White Hat McCarty all had a look at it. None cf
" them could see the inkstand at the price asked, and McCarty was so cruel as
Q to say that the Jockey Club of Guatemala was "on the bum" to give such an
S inkstand to a President. Finally it was turned over to Dan Burns to use. and
O he tried it for a month, but he said that he could write just as well with ink
â â¦â  that came out of a 50-cent inkstand. In the meantime Rebus showed the or-
O nament to some jewelers and they offered to duplicate it at the rate of $25
X per inkstand. Then came the disclosure. Rebus learned from reliable and
" original sources that the inkstand had been only the property of some penny
q a-liner in Guatemala, so he took the ornament and returned it to Jones, at
<f the same time telling him what he thought of him. The foreigner was wroth,
â¬ and in no uncertain terms he expressed his estimation of the Americans in
â¦ general and some of them in particular, whom he said did not know a genuine
~ relic and priceless treasure from a hole in the eround. So, after all. poor
q Mr. Jones will h -j to wait until next payday comes.

PERRAULT DOES
NOT POSE AS
A REFORMER
He Does Not Believe
in Undue Haste.
TALKS OF APPROPRIATIONS
LEGACIES OF THE OLD i.OARD TO
BE BEVIEWED.
Supervisor Kalben Explains His Ac
tion Rescinding the Recommenda
tion Allowing Mutual Electr-c
Company to Erect Poles.
Supervisor Perrault disclaims any inten
tion to pose as a reformer, and in ex
planation of his opposition to certain ap
propriations by the board he says he was
actuated by the best of motives and a due
regard for the Inti rests of the city.
"There has been." said Perrault, "much
adverse criticism us to my course in post
poning consideration of these appropria
tions. 1 would like it understood that
my resolution does not cancel them, but
simply defers action until such time as
they ran receive the consideration they
desi rye and until we can become thor
oughly conversant with the city's finances
and its legal responsibilities. 1 believe
our proper course in the matter of the
contracts made by our predecessors and
handed down to us as legacies to be one
of calm deliberation, and I claim the right
to review the acts of the past board in
order to protect the present one.
"In the item of the appropriation of
$12('u fur steps leading up to Joyce street,
I have carefully Investigated the proposi
tion, and 1 find that the property-owners
have been paying for those stops for the
past thirty-five years. The city has never
assumed the responsibility of providing
the Bteps, and it is optional with it to
maintain them or not. Now the proper
method to pursue would be to re-estab
lish the grade so as to open the street to
traffic. Of course, this would leave the
property abutting on it some twenty-five
feet above the grade, but that plan has
been followed on other streets.
"As to (he $25,000 for the condemnation
of Twenty-fifth street, that is another
matter which the Board should not pass
until thorough inquiry has been made
mm it. Although the Street Committee
will undoubtedly report In favor of the
condemnation, 1 believe by postponing
action some of the $75,000 could be saved,
since many of the property-owners are
willing to deed necessary property to the
city and In that way the cost would be
much less than the amount requested.
"lii regard to the appropriation of $50,000
for a new Police Station, the lowest bid
submitted exceeded the appropriation and
new bids will be opened to-day. While the
actual necessity of the station and the
consequent increased expense that it
would entail without commensurate re
sults are apparent to me, still 1 am sure
it could be built for less money.
"In the matter of the appropriation of
$86,000 for furnishing the If all of Justice,
the veto of the Mayor was sustained and
new plans and specifications have been
ordered. I consider that the necessary
furniture can be made for much less than
that figure and thÂ« new bids, I think, will
confirm mo.
"The $OS"n for a -water filter system for
the City Hall is exorbitant on the face of
it. and that amount could be scaled down
and still leave a fair margin of profit.
"The resolution authorizing the em
ployment of twenty-five extra policemen,
which was rescinded, Is only a temporary
affair, as the new charter will give this
city one policeman for every 500 inhabit
ants, and that will make over 60U guar
dians of the peace.
"The $14,000 for the improvement of Hol
ly and Bernal Parks, of which $6250 had
been expended by the old board, merits
our careful consideration, as does the
$1500 for the extension of Van Ness
avenue, although I believe the latter im
provement essential. We desire to see
that the funds are wisely distributed in
order to accomplish the best results.
"The new Gas Inspector. Tupper -will
introduce some needed reforms in the ad
ministration of his office, and these will
go far to pay his first year's salary. For
example, lie will recommend that the pus
lamps situated near electric lights should
not be lit as being superfluous, and
this of itself will effect quite a saving.
Again, he will endeavor to have policemen
act as inspectors, who will note when the
lamps are lit and when extinguished, from
which an estimate can be formed, -c will
also try to have the city districted â itb
regard to contracts for lighting, and the
rates will be regulated accordingly."
Supervisor Perrault is not the only one
on the board who is chagrined at the un
kind things that have been said about
him with reference to Ms official acts.
Supervisor Kalben was very wrothy at th.->
accusation that the Street Committee was
standing in with the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company in refusing ita
rival, the Mutual Electric Light Com
pany, the privilege of erecting poles out
side the fire limits.
"The matter has simply been post
poned," said he "until the committee can
act intelligently upon it. I do not like
the methods pursued in the case by the
Mutual Company. I consider that I
should have been consulted in regard to
it, but when the petition was presented I
was rot at tho meeting, although earlier
in the day representatives of the corpora
tion stated that they had no petition to
make. I don't like to have anything forced
down my throat, and believe that 1 am
entitled to know something about the sub
ject. That is why I signed my name re
scinding action in the margin of the
original recommendation. Let these peo
ple come out in the open, and I am sure
they will receive favorable consideration
if their claims are just. Let the members
of the committee know something about
what they are recommending, and no dis
satisfaction will result."
LIGHT AIRS WAFT
THE OAKLAND NAVY
CANOE WHIM MAKES BEST TIME
KOUND THE COURSE.
First Sailing Race of the Season of
1899 Was Held Yes
terday.
The first sailing race of 1899 was held
yesterday on Oakland Creek in a light but
variable breeze, the prevailing direction
of which was northerly. It was the open
ing race of that formerly famous organi
zation, the Oakland Navy. The course,
officially reckoned at six miles, is trian
gular, and the boats, after sailing along
the first leg, returned to the starting
point and thence sailed twice complete
ly over the three legs of the course. The
wind was for the most part on the quar
ter all round the course, but now and
then the sheets could bo slacked out a
little. The breeze was so light that it
hardly si.; 1 : â â¢â¢ <i to move the larger boats
at any considerable rate of speed, though
the canoes made fair headway under it.
The preparatory signal was fired and
a red flag hoisted at 1:02 o'clock, and the
starting gun, from which the times of
all the boats were reckoned, at 1:07 a. m.
The half-rater. Ninette, made a pretty
start. She crossed the line before the
gun fire, went about, and returning crossed
the line ahead of the other boats. Dur
ing the earlier part of the race the
Ninette kept the lead: then ihc was
passed by the carton Whim, which was
in turn passed by the canoe Gnat, re
christened Brownie. The Gnat, running
into a calm streak, wan passed by the
Whim and the Ninette, the Whim even
tually winning in an elapsed time of 1
hour 48 minui.s and 3G seconds, followed
by the Ninette, whose elapsed time was
1 hour and 51 minutes. The Gnat was
third, having covered the course in 1
hour 52 minutes and 31 seconds. The
Flash was ruled out by the referee, and
her case was referred to the members of
the committee for having taken a new
man on board after the preparatory gun
had been fired. The results of the re
gatta are shown in the table:

STUART AFTER THE BIG FIGHT.
Will Offer a Purse for Sharkey and
Fitzsimmons.
W. K. Wheelock, who was associated
with Dan Stuart in the management of
the Corbett-Fitzsimmons right at Carson,
| is authority for the statement that the
: Texas sport is after the proposed cham
pionship conteet between Fitzsimmons
and Sharkey. Stuart is at present so
journing at Hot Springs. Ark. Mr. Whee
loek has received several letters from the
j famous fight promoter recently, in which
Stuart says he is ready to offer a purse
i for the contest as soon as the men signify
their intention of doing business.
"An early right would probably suit
Fitzsimmons best," said Mr. Wheelock,
"but Sharkey may want to hold off
awhile. There i.s no doubt that Fitz is
i the greatest lighter of the age and is en
; titled to the championship until he is de
f( ated in the ring. But while T beiieve he
was Sharkey's superior at the time he
fought Corbett it is not likely that he is
. any better now, while Sharkey has great
ly Improved since that time. The men
, should enter the ring on even terms, al
i though Fitz, being the champion, would
naturally be a slight favorite. There are
several places where a finish fight could
be brought off now, but I do not think it
advisable to name any place for the con-
I test at this time. The: pavilion at Carson
is still standing and the people of that
. city would give us a warm reception.
Carson labors under the disadvantage
however, of being far from centers of
population and I am afraid the Southern
Pacific would not make the rates suffi
ciently low to wnrrar.t anyone offering a
, large purse for a right in that city. If
! the men come together It will be a finish
i fight, as all championship contests must
!be decided in that way. If the tight is
' brought off by Stuart the public will know
: that it Is getting a square deal and a
' run for its money."
Mr. Wheelock says Stuart will be In San
San Francisco within the next thirty days
and by that time he may have some defin
ite proposition to submit to the tightens.
Rebholtz's Sunday Experience.
William Rebholtz, a green man In a
strange city, while ambulating on Stock
ton street yesterday forenoon, met May
| Holmes, a smiling denizen of the tender
j loin. An acquaintance sprung up be
tween the pair and Rebholtz entered the
spider's web. and after partaking of pome
ambercd liquid, which was freighted in
by the "growler" mute through the
agency of BSiSfl Holmes' lover, Rebholtz
took a nap on a lounge. When he awoke
his pockets were empty, and $6 50, which
1 they had contained before he took his
I snooze, was gone. The loss of the silver
was reported to Officer Thompson, who
] brought Miss Holmes to the California
\ street station and locked her up on a

RAN OVER THE HILL?
Olympic Club Athletes Enjoyed en
Outing at Sausalito.
The Olympic Club held the first cross
country run of this year under the lead
ership of Captain George James yester
day. Forty-three "members took the B
o'clock morning boat to Sausalito. and,
having changed their clothes in the
house of the San Francisco Yacht Club,
the use of which was kindly granted for
the occasion, started at 9 o'clock for a
run through the reservation to Limo
Point, thence over the hills and back to
Sausalito by another route.
All started gaily together, but ere long
the runners had split up into little
bunches according to their rate of speed.
The leaders were Klarman, Kreling. Col
lins, Taylor, McConnell. James, Duffy,
Pierson, Cunningham and Davis. F. R.
Butz started out at a good pace, but
slowed down considerably; however, he
finished in good condition. Superinten
deni Kennedy and E. N. Short kept the
pace up and finished in the second bunch.
Klarman, Davis and McConnell divided
the honor ot finishing first, and the rest
mraggfed in in little knots of two, throe
'â r four. Tho latest comers reached the
yachthouse half an hour after the lead
ing trio.
After a swim in the bay and a well
ii rest, the party dined at Perrier's

WINS THE SILVER TROPEY.
James McCarren on the Subject of
Temperance and Patriotism.
The essay contest between the repre
sentatives of the parishes with the
Third District of the League of the Cross,
yesterday afternoon at Metropolitan
Temple, was won by James McCarren of
Company M. His opponents in the con
were: James Seymour of Company
C, John Dillon of St. Rose's Parish. Wil
liam McMahon of Company H and
Charles Flynn of Company M. The
judges, who rendered the decision, were:
Miss Julia Coffey, George R. E. Maxwell
and Professor Jj. Taafe.
The prize awarded was a silver medal
which entitles the winner to compete i<>r
the Archbishop Rlordan gold medal at
the annual rally of the entire league. The
subject chosen for discussiun was "Tem
perance and Patriotism."
The individual ideas of it by the
different essayists was almost Identical.
Each endeavored to impress upon his
auditors the fact that intemperence is the
greatest of all corses man has to contend
with. A well-defined eamparison was |
drawn between the sober man and the
habitual drunkard. The victory that the
Americans won in the last war was at
tributed not merely to the force of arms,
but the temperance of the commanders
and sailors and soldiers who fought with
success against their foes.
A feature of the rally was an eloquent
address by the Rev. Father Dempsey of
Bt M&nr's Cathedral. In it he reviewed
the subject of the essays and reiterated
the thoughts expressed in them.
Father O'Ryan of St. Mary's Cathedral,
who acted as chairman of the rally, clos
ed the exercises with a prayer.
Return of the Bear.
Latfl last evening the stanch ol'l reve
nue cutter Bear, Captain Tuttle. R. C. S.,
steamed into harbor, four days from Se
attle. This is the return from a long,
perilous cruise in northern waters to the
rescue of the whaling crews strandt .i at
Cape Barrow. She left Seattle Christ
mas day, 1897, loaded with food and cloth
ing for the castaways, and the story of
her gallant plunge through the ice has
been told. The rescue was successful,
and the men were returned to civilization
fomo time ago. The vessel will refit and
otherwise prepare for her coming summer
cruise.

Touching Bit f Patriotism.
A gentleman who was sailing up and
down the coast hist summer in his yacht
told me that one day he put in at Glouces
i ter. and had no sooner come to anchor
1 than he noticed that all the flags in the
| town were flying at half-mast. He had
i had no opportunity to hear the news for
j two or three days, and was inclined by
I the half-masting of the Mags to suppose
I that some public man had died in the in
terval. Perhaps some general had fallen
in the war, he fancied. He lost no time in
j going ashore and making inquiry. Then
j he learned that all these signs of mourn
i Ing were for a private soldier belonging
in Gloucester who had died in the service
of his country and whose body had been
brought home for burial. The yachtsman
was much Impressed by this incident. As
a man who had traveled abroad, he felt
fiirp that in no other country would the
flags of a whole city be half-masted as a
token of mourning at the death of a com
mon soldier, and he was proud of the pub
lic sentiment, at once intensely patriotic
and sincerely and unconsciously demo
cratic which ngprnpted such an honor. â

The English Blue and White.
In 1748 George II accidentally met the
Duchess of Bedford on horseback in a
blue riding habit faced with white, and
was s.o pleased with the effect of it that,
a question having been just raised as to
the propriety of deciding upon some gen
eral dress for the royal navy, he imme
diately commanded the adoption of these
colors, a regulation which appears never
to have been gazetted, nor does it exist
in the records of the Admiralty, although
a subsequent one in 1757 refers to it.â

DISAPPEARS FROM
PACIFIC GROVE
Search Made for the Body of F.
W, Ellis, a Prominent
Citizen.
PACIFIC Gr.OVE, Jan. 29.â This town has been more stirred in the
last two days than ever before in its history by the inexplicable disap
pearance of F. W. Ellis, one of the most highly respected and promi
nent citizens. He was last seen at 1 p. m. Friday on the streets of
Monterey, apparently all right mentally and physicrlly. No further
trace has been found, except a letter signed by Ellis and received by
Charles K. Tuttle. stating that when the letter was received Ellis
would be at the bottom of Monterey Bay. The letter war mailed in
Monterey Friday afternoon. Ellis was a member o. local Masonic and A.
O. U. W. lodges and searching parties have been sent by both organiza
tions throughout the surrounding country for trace 3 of the missing man.
Ellis was despondent from continued business disasterp, and having just
recovered from a severe attack of the grip, is supposed to have been
temporarily mentally unbalanced. When he left home he had a revolver.
Parties have been patrolling the beach along the bay to recover the
body. Ellis has a wife and six daughters.

SUNDAY SCHOOLS
Atlanta to Entertain
Many Guests.
WILL ASSEMBLE IN APRIL
SEVERAL THOUSAND DELE
GATES EXPECTED.
Plans for the Work in Newly Ac
quired Possessions of the
United States to Be
Mapped Out.
Special DispaKh to The Call.
ATLANTA, Ga., Jan. 29.â The local
committee having in charge the ar
ran-cme I"*'1 "*' for the Ninth Jriennial In
ternational Sr.r.day-school convention,
which is to be held here in Anril next
in the Ynung Men's Christian Associa
tion parlnrs, met to-day and took up
the work of carir - for xV > big gather
ing and looking into other details. The
convention will meet on April 27, 2S and
29 and about 2000 delegates from all
parts of the United States, several
South American countries, Canada,
Mexico, England and possibly India
will be here, beveral days before the
convention the international lesson
committee, of which Kjv. John Potts.
D.D., of Toronto, Onto , is chairman,
will meet in Atl. ta to map out the
Sunday-soLool lessons for the next six
years.
Possibly the most important work to
come before the cony on will be the
study of whet Sunday-school work can
and should be done in tl.e newly ac-
quired territory of the United States
and in Cuba, The Baptist, Methodist
and other denominational Sunday
school boards have already begun the
establishment of Sunday-schools in
Porto Rico, Cuba, and even Hawaii.
The international organization will
take up this matter, and these new ac
quisitions to our territory undoubtedly
will be taken into the international field.
If the Philippines are permanently ac
quired the work wi: c carried on over
there.
A number of changes in th Sunday
school work will be discussed and some
important changes inaugurated. The
work among the colored population of
the south will be given es*pecial atten
tion. Mexico has only recently been
taken into the Held, and the work there
must be considered. The convention
does not draw the line at color or race.
There will be a number of negro dele
gates, and in view of this fact two or
three of Atlanta's leading colored citi
zens have 1 placed on the local ar
rangements committee
At to-day s meetin- it was decided to
open the convention with a musical
chorus of 1500 voices at the auditorium
in Exposition Park. The entertainment
committee, headed by H. H. Cabanos,
includes among its members Hoke
Smith and ex-Governor Northen. It
has sub-committees in each of the 110
churches of Atlanta. Rev. F. R. Car
ter, pastor of Â» colored church with
5000 members, is leading the colored
people in the matter.
The convention will represent S.nw ov
Sunday-school scholars and about 200.
--000 schools. The largest gathering in
the history of the international associa-
tion is expected.
ENGLISH SWORDS.
The presentation of a sword to Lord
Kitchener (writes a correspondent) in
vests for the moment the swords gener
erally of our warriors with a certain spe
cial interest. It is useful to know, per
haps, that the average prioe%f a One
! man's sword is 5 guineas, while a guards
man's costs Â£7 10s. The cavalry sword
is r.4 l^ Lnchefl long and weighs 2 pounds
9 ounces. It is an admittedly imperfect
I sword, as it is meant to combine cutting
â  and thrusting, and so is slightly curved.
: The wit of man has not yet devised a
I sword which will be perfect els both a
j cutting and a thrusting weapon. The best
I cutting sword should be heavy and curved
to allow it to bo drawn as you would a
knife through a piece of meat. Our Indian
cavalry have the curved swords, and our
; horsemen used them in the Peninsular
| war. Experience has proved, however,
that a slight punctured wound is much
â  more deadly than a severe cut. An army
; surgeon who had had eleven years' expe
; rience in India once stated that, while he
I had seen the most trifling punctured
wounds terminate fatally, the most fright
: ful cuts were cured. Now the best thrust
: ing sword should be light, narrow, and
! straight, not heavy, broad and curved.
; Our sword is neither one thing nor the
other, but, like so much else in this em
; pire of ours, a compromise. It is slightly
; curved toward the point. Still, on
: the whole, it seems to have served
pretty well at the Omdurman charge. The
, officers' swords, it may be mentioned, are
: generally made of the very best steel ob
tainable, namely, ingot cast steel. The
i metal, however, does not affect the cost
: appreciably. What enhances that is tho
j workmanship, which may be carried to
a very high artistic point, as the Sirdar's
sword proves.â London News.
Strange Funeral Customs.
In an interesting history of his parish
the Rev. James Murray of Kilmaleom,
Renfrewshire, mentions that "nmid the
enjoyments of the people we must not
' fail to notice funerals ; arid he calls at
tention to a curious custom which was
prevalent in connection with them. It ap
pears a sieve containing clay pipes filled
with tobacco was handed around just be
fore the cortege started. Then the mourn
* ers smoked, and when the kirkyard was
; reached, as the grave was being flllled,
i each stepped solemnly forward and cast
his pipe "amang the mools."â Notes and

THE SAD PLIGHT
OF THE UNPAID
CITY TEACHERS
Many on the Verge of
Destitution.
AWAIT SEAWELL'S DECISION
PETITION TOR THE MISSION
COMMERCIAL CLASS.
An Old Order Against the Marriage
of Teachers Which the Board of
Education Is Not Inclined
to Test.
The 27th of this month was expected
by the unpaid teachers to have proved a
"Good Friday" for them, as Judge Sea
well was to have rendered a decision on
that day, which, they hoped, would dis
solve the injunction suit, thus permitting
them to receive at least their salary for
January if not for November and De
cember. But the matter went over to
next Friday, and they. are still waiting.
How Important this salary matter is to
theso employes of the School Department
may be known by the statement that
there are at least 200 unpaid teachers who
are absolutely in want for their three
months' pay. Most of them are. dependent
on their salaries for support from month
to month, not having a dollar laid up fora
rainy day or a school fund deflcit. Rent,
grocery bills and other household ex
penses are staring them in the face, and
no money in sight.
A few instances may show to what des
perate straits those unfortunates are re
duced. One teacher, who had purchased
furniture for her cottage several months
ago on installments, now finds not only
the wolf at her door, but the collector us
well. If the educational money market
or this city does not loosen- up soon she
will lose her furniture and the previous
payments on the. same. Another is three
months In arrears for board and lodging
for herself and little family, and her land
lord, being unfortunately in deep water
from his own business disasters, is on
the verge of closing up his establishment,
ills school teacher tenant is penniless
and the street is threatening her. A third
has been lifting a mortgage from her
nome by monthly payments, but for four
months she has been unable to meet her
obligations and her creditor is clamorous
Panics could be given in many cases
proving that this statement is not imagin
ary, but, of course, such publication will
not be made. While many of the mer
chants and other creditors, who have sup
ply claims against the department, need
their money, their situation is not nearly
so desperate as that of the unpaid teach
ers.
Judge Seawell's decision, if favorable to
an immediate settlement of these claims,
should come speedily. Seven days' delay
means much to a penniless creditor. Tt
has been stated tbkt the decision may
force the entire school system of the city
to shut down for three months. Such
result would bring trouble on trouble for
the already destitute teachers.
In the work of retrenchment and econ
omy such questions as salaried vacations
and the employment of married female
teachers have come into notice. The va
cation matter may be disposed of by the
fact that teachers are really employed by
the year and formerly they were paid in
eight installments, which arrangement
was afterward changed to twelve pay
ments. The matrimonial matter was not
so easily settled. There is an ancient rule,
order or law in the department, that a
married woman shall not be elected as a
teacher and should a teacher marry she
must resign. Several years ago the
board "let down the bars," as an old
bachelor educator expressed it, "and
about a dozen schoolmarms immediately
Jumped over into the matrimonial corral.
This rush to the altar caused the cruel
Directors to put up the bars again. How
ever, there has been a marriage now and
then, but the board has never dared to
make a test of their law, fearing that no
Supreme Court would decide that a bride
was professionally or morally incompe
tent, even if she add her earnings to her
husband's income.
The following petition protesting
against the closing of the Mission High
School commercial department was ac
tively circulated yesterday and over 2000
signatures were obtained.
To the Honorable Board of Education of the
City and County of San Franciscoâ Gentlemen:
The undersigned taxpayers and residents of the
Mission and parents of children attending the
Mission High School, and whose children are
students in the commercial classes of Bald
school, respectfully and earnestly ask you not
to dose the said commercial classes. We
heartily Indorse your determination to correct
the many evils caused by the unlawful and
wrongful action of the late linard, but we ask
you to consider thp welfare of the one hundred
and three pupils in the commercial classes of
the Mission High School, who are now in the
middle of the school year and would be de
prived of all the benefits of their last year's
Btudy If the resolution of your board passed
last Wednesday evening is now enforced. We
believe that you are faithfully endeavoring to
improve the schools of the city, but we ask
you to give us an opportunity to be heard in
this important matter, and we therefore again
urge that the order closing the commercial
classes of the Mission High School should be
suspended and that we be granted a hearing
at the next meeting of your board.
The petition will be presented to the
Board of Education this evening. Princi
pal Bush of the Polytechnic states that
his school can accommodate about eighty
five pupulls from the Mission commercial
classes.
PARIS IS PROVINCIAL.
Thinks Only of Dreyfus and Thinks
All the World Does So, Too.
I went out on Sunday to a little town
just over twenty miles from Paris. I
dined in the innâ a couple of cyclists from
Paris yawning at the other side of the
table, a local notary and a couple of
friends at the top. Afterward, having no
French money, I proposed to pay the bill
with a sovereign. A sovereign is currency
in the remotest village of Norway, in
Turkey, in Egyptian mud bazaars, where
a whlto man is hardly ever seen. But the
French innkeeper, twenty miles from
Paris, had never seen a sovereign and
never heard of one, and he absolutely
declined, with the utmost politeness, to
bid more than 20 francs for it.
That is a parable of the present state of
things In France. In England we are
troubled and grave, preparing our fleets,
regretful that France will be our enemy,
that France insists on having war. But
if war came nobody would be more utter
ly astounded than France. France is
paying absolutely no attention to the
Fashoda question. If we declared war
France would consider it a most unpro
voked aggression, just as she regards the
present plain speaking of our journals as
mere mud throwing, such as she is ac
customed to read in her own press about
the Dreyfus affair.
France, in brief, is just nuw Interested
in something elseâ namely, the affair.
And it is utterly impussili'.e to persuade
her that what absorbs her floea not equal
ly absorb the whole world. The queen of
civilization is wholly and hopelessly
provincial.â London Mail.
One Way to Go Hunting.
A remarkable occurrence is reported
from Millau (Aveyron). Two broth
ers named Perie, living at Peyrcioau,
]i arned that in a crovas.se in the rocit?
near thoir village vsas a i-ave frequented
| by a large number of more or less wild
beasts. They decided to trap them, and
I devisul tin fallowing cruel plan.
Taking to the entrance of the crevasse
a live fox which they had captured, they
soaked the poor animal in petroleum, set
It on fire and drove It into the beasts'
den, after having constructed before the
| mouth of the crevasse a barricade suffl
i ciently strong to check any rush that
I might be made by the inmates.
The latter, maddened by the terrifying
spectacle of the burning fox, which
dashed about In all directions In its
agony, made a desperate rush for the
exit, fighting and tearing one another in
their wild efforts to escape.
In less time than It takes to tell, the
stupefied hunters saw their barricade in
vaded by an avalanche of various kinds
of animals, upon which they threw them
selves and struck out right and left with
clubs and knives. At last all the beasts
were killed, though the hunters did not
escape scot free. When the dead animals
were collected it was found that there
were two badgers, seven wild rabbits,
three martens, eleven weasels, one pole
cat, four foxes, five hedgehogs, nine
squirrels, seventeen snakes, six owls and
fifteen bats.â London Mail.
Old Dundee.
Where docks now line the river front
and merchantmen float, shaggy natives
paddled their little craft and fished They
were hardy and adventurous, and, con
tent neither with gathering shellfish on
the shore nor with hooking the salmon
and Sperling, they attacked and captured
the larger visitors to the firth, notably
the porpoise. They hunted, too, and, with
venison from the forests and beyond the
Law and fish from the river, no doubt
fared sumptuously every day.
These hunters and fishermen lived on
Tayside at a period so remote that tne
most cautious guess concerning it takes
on a shade of recklessness. Less than
twenty years ago they were found to have
left a record of themselves in a rubbish
heap known in scientific nomenclature as
a 'kitchen midden." Raking through the
debris of the life primeval disclosed, says
Mr. Lamb, "shells of edible mollusks
mixed with a quantity of burned wood,
pieces of bone artificially split, porpoise
bones, deers' horns, and stone imple
ments." No doubt was thus left of the
occupation and mode of life of the set
tlers.
Now comes the remarkable part of the
story. The "midden" was covered with
earth twelve feet deep, "either detritus or
the result of a landslip," and eight feet
above the excavators found twelve stone
coffins of the Roman era. "Ages must
have elapsed," says the antiquary, be
tween the time when the Stannergate was
inhabited by these early fishermen and
the Stone Period, when the interments
took place."â Good "Words.
Grewsome Statues.
Seeing that flower fads and even Im
mortelles have but their day. the sorrow
ing family of one gentleman cast about
for some original and enduring way of
perpetuating the memory of their belo'ed
one, and they discovered it. too. Briefly,
they immortalized by metallizing him.
That is to say. they reversed the opera
tion of the pagan gods and changed the
body of what was once a living creature
Into a statue, which is to be seen at the
Cemetery of Pere Laehaise, where it lies
in a triple coffin of glass. The corpse
having been plunged into phenic acid, and
washed in a solution of silver, was placed
in a galvano-plastic bath. The result is
a statue in every respect Identical with
the individual, and. to use a Hibermcism,
strikingly lifelike. The doctor whose
method was successfully .â¢mployed to
bring about this curious transmutation
confidently hopes that in future all public
statue will be made on the same principle.
But the statue-erecting mood no longer
prevails in Paris just now. Indeed, most
politicians and people arc Iconoclasts, and
would gladly demolish many of the ex
isting monuments to dead celebrities, Â«nd
quite a number of living ones to boot.â

Prussian Compulsory Service.
Compulsory Fervico has been in force in
Prussia since 1817, and in 1871 it was ex
tended to the whole of the empire. Every
German, with exceptions similar to those
in France, must serve twelve years in the
army or navy. The term of service in
cludes two years with the colors in the
standing army (three years in the caval
ry and artillery); four years in the re
serve of the standing army, two years in
the Landwehr and four years in the Land
strum. On leaving the active army and
passing into the reserves the men may
he refused permission to emigrate during
their first year of civil life.
After the standing army has been re
cruited to its full strength each year the
surplus conscripts are enrolled in the
Ersatztruppen, and for twelve years un
dergo annual training. Until the age of
42 ; v 1 1 Germans, whether they have served
in the active army or only in the Ersatz
truppen, are liable to be called upon to
serve in the Landstrum. In the infantry
men of good education are allowed, under
certain conditions, to purchase their dis
charge after one year's service. â Cham

Found the Needle After 17 Years.
In the summer of 1881 Miss Emma J.
Keener of Marion, <>.. swallowed a needle
one inch and a fourth long, which she had
used in sewing. At the time It gave her
much alarm, but, suffering no incon
venience, she was advised to await re
sults, as nothing could be done but to let
it have its course. The following year
she married Jacob W. Berry. She is now
the mother of six children, but has not
suffered from any serious illness, occa
sionally complaining of a distress in the
stomach, which was attributed to indi
gestion. For three days past she has
complained of something pricking her in
the pit of the stomach, which sensation
increased in violence, until last evening
she discovered a sharp point protruding
from the stomach just below the eugi
form cartilage, and, upon grasping it,
brought out the broken needle, three
fourths of an inch in length. The ques
tion now that troubles the patient is,
what has become of the other piece of
the needle, and how did it become broken?
She is suffering no Inconvenience, but is
somewhat nervous over the result.âCin

ATTEMPTING TO
HIDE THE SPOTS
OF A LEOPARD
Combine Said
to Be Inactive.
THE LATEST POLITICAL JOKE
IS OAKLAND AH ASYLUM FOR
LUNATICS?
Many Interesting Side-Lights Are
Throwing Their 3-ays on che
Approaching Elec
tion.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 20.
Oakland cm always be depended upon
to act queerly at a municipal election,
and it is very evident that this year is to
be no exception. Judging by some of the
men with official records, who are again
declaring they would like a term of of
fice, one might suppose that such can
didates consider Oakland as being one
large lunatic asylum. Nor would such a
conclusion be altogether unwarranted.
In the past men known to be opposed to
public Interests and personal rights have
been elected several times to succeed
themselves, and just now an attempt is
being made to repeat the trick. It re
mains for the voters to declare their com
petency or non-competency by electing or
repudiating such candidates.
The suggestion is being insidiously
whispered about all over the city that the
water companies are not taking any hand
in this campaign. It is referred to as a
remarkable fact that the combine is do
ing nothing politically and is evidently
content to let matters take their course.
Just why these rumors should be so in
dustriously circulated and in such a man
ner as to appear to possess the imprint
of truth can hardly deceive an intelligent
voter. It might deceive a few individuals
who see in the water companies a means
of purifying politics, but none other.
If anything can be more absurd and
more insulting to an intelligent citizen
than the suggestion that the water com
panies are not interested in a political
campaign, I would like to know what it
â¢ 'akland has developed all kinds of
freaks and freakishness. but has never
yet sent forth such an Insane idea that
twoâ or oneâ powerful corporations are
not interested in their income. To place
nee in such suggestions is to believe
that the corporations do not care whether
water rates are 25 cents or as many dol
lars. Oi course, the water companies are
in politics, and the fact that they are not
working openly on the streets or shout
ing from housetops is the best proof pos
sible that they are gradualjy extending
their tentacles under the surface and do
ing everything possible to elect a Council
that will do their bidding as faithfully as
did the six men last spring.
Comment has often been made on the
fact that in addition to the seven Coun
cilmen, one from each ward, there should
be four t'ouncilmen at large, provided for
by the city charter. The four extra mem
bers cannot be apportioned evenly among
seven wards, and therefore the favored
wards hav>- always been'able by starting
out with two votes, to obtain an ad
vantage over other wards less fortunate.
There can be no doubt that it was not an
accident that the charter provides for
these four extra Councilmen.
A giant â  at Oakland's organic law re- j
veals two facts, the signficance of which j
is not sufficiently appreciated. One is that
the Mayor possesses the power of vetoing
a!! ordinances passed by the Council, the
other is thai eight out of the eleven votes j
are necessary to pass a measure over the
Mayor's veto. Thus it can be seen at a
glance that an agreeable Mayor and four,
agreeable Councilmen control the- situa- :
tlon, and that any interest has only to in
sure the election of the Mayor and four
Councilmen to snap its finger at the re- |
maining seven Councilmen. therefore, su
preme efforts are always made by those
Who would control government for selfish
purposes to center their strength upon the I
Mayor and the Councilmen at largeâ and ;
in one way or other they have generally j
succeeded.
Two years ago they succeeded in cap- i
turing three of the wards, and these three.
with their two Councilmen at large and
Colonel Woodward, given to them by ap
pointment of Mayor Thomas, made the ;
"solid six."
At this time it is well for people who do j
not approve <>f paying a fair rate for i
wr.tf r and an equal amount t'> the compa- j
nies for influencing legislation, to bear
these ideas In mind. I do not believe it !
possible for any of the six Councilmen to i
ho re-elected, nor do I believe it possible :
for the four of the other five who are
seeking re-election to be <!< feated. In
either instance the disgrace to the city
would be perf* ct.
Altogether too much has been said
about Rev. Dr. Coyle's signature being on
Councilman Woodward's petition. The in
cident possesses no Hignfieaneo, and If It
was exploited by Woodward for the pur
pose of drawing votes toward him !t has
proved a positive boomerang. It has
caused Dr. Coyle to state positively that
hf will not vote for Woodward and that
Woodward is aware of Â«. Dr. Coyle act
ed in my judgment in a very straightfor
ward manner. Woodward has a perfect
right to get on the ballot, and this right
of citizenship cannot be taken away from
him by any political party. No doubt on
his petition there are Democrats. Republi
can? and others .and the names possess no
significance except as each represents one
of the number necessary to enable him to
plac< himself in nomination.
It is perhaps better that Woodward
should go before the people on ins merits.
If the Fifth Ward should re-elect him its
residents would he honorably compelled to
consider themselves as bodyguards to any
Councilman whom in the future it might
be necessary to escort home to protect
him from outraged citizens. Any resi
dent in the Fifth Ward should be eager to
have Mr. Woodward's name go before
the. people for municipal honors, for it Is
undoubtedly the best manner poss, â  â â¢â  in
which Mr. Woodward can be assured
that his judgment as a Councilman in
certain matters is not favorable with his
constituents.
It would bo a pretty safe speculation to
support Felton Taylor for a winner in the
race with Major Woodward.
Overzealousness is not commendable in
legislation. This is realised now by those
gentlemen who handled the county gov
ernment bill at Sacramento two years
ago. A wave of economy which, like all
oib.rr good things, comes along' period
ically, pervaded the lawmakers, and Ala
meda County was left in an unenviable
position as regards her county officers.
From being remunerated much too hand
somely they Â«rere cut down to compara
tlvely moderate salaries. The pruning,
however, <iii not end with the principals.
The legislators undertook to arange for
the help of each office. In some instances
they were generous, in others niggardly.
Now those who were generously treated
arc satisfied; i"ne others are hoping for an
amendment, but so far have not met with
much encouragement This is not right.
The county departments in Alameda arc.
as a rule, well managed, and the public
has no right to complain. The argument
is being made at Sacramento that it
would be unconstitutional to increase the
salary of an official while in office. This
is tr<a. But it is niaking no increase 'to
the salary of an official to provide him
with enough deputies t'< do the work of
his office. Under the old plan of making
a lump appropriation for the office, no ad
fiiUon could be made during the term, but
FOR A REPUBLICAN BOARD OF WORKS.

now that the salaries have gone into ef
fect it would seem but just and reason
able that the necessary amendments be
supported by the Legislature.
There is one question I would like to
have answered which directly affects Ala
meda County. In the investigation into
bribery charges at Sacramento a tremen
dous amount of proof has been brought
out concerning the existence of the under
banded methods of Mr. Burns and Mr.
Grant. Yet all these facts have had to
be squeezed out through fear of the re
sult that might follow failure to testify.
How great is the mass of corruption tnat
must actually exist if all that, lias come
to light has had to be obtained under such
immense pressure? Perhaps there arc
some who would be able to speak for
this county. t
It was Indeed very unkind of the San
Francisco girls to take advantage of the
innocence of Oakland's young ladles and
teach them to like punch. In no other way
could the habit have taken a hold on
local society. It Is a very great argu
ment In favor of staying at home. Oak
land is a charming place, and there is no
need for her society to mix with the pre
cocious and punch-loving young people
across the water. The subject has been
so thoroughly raked over that the no
toriety can not fail of good results, li is
safe to predict that there will not be a
punch bowl at any young people's gath
ering for the rest of this season. If any
more dancers collapse on a ball room floor
some other reason must be sought. It
cannot be blamed to the example of those
bad San Francisco girls.

paper.
The bundle had been tied up with much
care and* when Brakeman John Gentry
discovered it he thought he had found a
prize. He was startled to find that the
package contained human flesh and
bones. The lower bones of the arm and
hand were intact and held together by
dry shreds of flesh. The humerus bone
and scapula had been separated, although
much flesh still clung to them.
The Coroner was notified and took
charge of the bones. A thorough Inves
tigation of the case will be made.
The bundle was placed in the car
some time .during the night. The car
reached Alameda two days ago and was
loaded with coal billed to Alameda point.
The work of discharging was completed
last night, when the car was swept out
and moved to the transfer station.
From the tapering fingers and long nails '
still clinging to the bones of the hand ;
some believe that the arm once belonged j
to a Chinaman and had been placed in the !
car by a medical student. On the other
hai^U the authorities think, that it may
point to .-ome horrible crime. This belief ;
is strengthened from the evident desire !
of the party who disposed of the bundle j
to have It carried away in the empty ;
boxcar, to be found at some point fÂ«tt' â 
remote from Alameda, where the possi. j
billty of geting a clue to the man who j
handled it would be extremely slight.
Jt has been suggested that the bones j
might give a clue to the fate of Adolph
Goetx, the Stanford University student,
who disappeared in Alameda last Novem
ber, lie left the hsuse of a friend lab'
at night to keep an appointment with a
strange man, who had written to Goetz
to meet him at a certain place in this city.
From that time nothing has been seen or ,
heard of him, and it is the general im- ,
presslon that he never got beyond tne
city limits.
The vicinity of the oil works is an ideal
place for the commission of crime. Jt is
a lonesome locality, abounding in old,
tumble down buildings, long ago deserted .
by th<*ir owners. It is possible that the I
amputated arm is not the first piece of \
human anatomy that has been put in an '
empty boxcar at West Alameda, and not |
found until the railroad had carried it far |
away. Some one of the old vacant build
ings in the vicinity may contain evidence
that will clear up the mystery and the
police â will to-morrow make a thorough
search of the locality.
A PASTOR ROASTS
THE LEGISLATURE
REV. F. S. BLUSH CAUSTICALLY
DISCUSSES THE SITUATION.
Scathing Reference to the Deadlock
and the Advocates of the Anti-
Cartoon Bill.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 29.â Rev. F. S. Brush,
pastor of the First Presbyterian Church,
discussed politics from his pulpit this
evening.
The title of the sermon was, "Wantedâ
Men. or Partisan Politics versus Patriot
ism." In part Rev. Mr. Brush said:
Recent scenes at Sacramento have given the
citizens of California a peep into the pit of
practical politics. The key to the situation is
that a considerable number of our legislators
have gone to their duties after having pledged
away their freedom as men, and the men who
have bartered away their freedom tor a loan
of money or for the sake of expected spoils
are so compactly organized that they can al
most dictate to the remainder of the Assembly.
The Whole system of pledging men is wrong,
and those most to blame are the pledged men
themselves, who have thus surrendered away
man â  highest and noblest prerogative. The
animus of the machine politician Is evidenced
by the dog-ln-the-manger policy that he pur
sues If his own pet candidate cannot be
elected then he declares he will tie up the
whole Legislature and block the election of
anybody else. It Is thus. In effect, a well
organlzi'd attempt to defeat the will of the
majority. The whole method of partisan poll
tics proves to be unropublican and truly im
moral.
Thus machine politics have been pushed to
the utmost to further the candidacy of a man
whom the whole press of his own party lias
dt-nounc.Ml and repudiated. It has been ;it
tempted to break the force of this fact by
saying that two of the great dailies of San
Francisco had Interested motives. But where
Is there a reputable paper In California that
supports the machine boss for Senator? Must
of us in times past have complained that party
papers would swallow almost anything for the
saJto of thflr party. But in this case all good
men rejoice Rt the outspoken words of the
press of California.
And these men have passed a bill forbidding
cartoons of public men: Germany has enjoyed
such a law for many years. But Germany Is
not America. Who Is afraid of cartoons?
There Is scarcely a wepk passes but that the
comic papers hnve cartoons of ministers. It'
some of them should get together and enter an
action for libel I would think them a parcel of
fools. I laugh at these cartoons heartily my
eelf and would laugh at any on myself pro
vided my conscience was clean. Dr. ParKburst
was cartooned and lampooned in New York. I
never heard that he cared or that he was hurt
by it. Hut when Boss Tweed was r-artooned
Tweed had introduced into the New York Leg
islature an act against cartooning public men.
Comment Is unnecessary-
THE "KID" HAS GONE.
Weller, the Kacehorse Plunger, Left
in Search of a Different Game.
"Kid" Weller. racehorse owner, plunger
and general all-aroÂ»nd sport, has shaken
from his patent leathers the dust of Cali
fornia. It may also be added that the
"Kid" has also shaken from his pockets
no small amount of dust of the delightful
golden kind. The little man, who came
here only a few weeks ago heralded as
the Bismarck of the betting ring, has evi
dently found the same not to his liking.
He left last evening at 5 o'clock for Los
Angeles, where he will spend to-day and
then proceed to the Hot Springs. Once
there the "Kid" proposes to have a go at
the game of faro and the straight Ameri
can poker with a draw.
Weller leaves behind him a number of
his horses. He also has a dozen in Mem
phis. Those that he leaves here in the
care of his trainers will no doubt be
shortly sent East in the effort to regain
what the "Kid" lost on them while here.
It is asserted that Weller's experience is
similar to that of many other sports here,
who have found the winners in California
hard, very hard, to pick. The "Kid,"
from the mere fact that he has sense
enough to jump a game that he can't
beat, will no doubt soon again be in pos
session of his lost shekels in other fields
where the game is of a softer nature.

FIRE CLAIMS TWO

Little Child Burned
to Death.
The Qld Man Left to His
Fate by Excited

Heroism ot a Boy Who
Saved a Baby From
the Flames.
THE San Bruno Hotel, an old land
mark on the San Bruno Road, be
came food for flames shortly before
the noon hour yesterday. An old
man named Matthius Eichorn, who
perved in the capacity of a porter
about the place, was hemmed in by
the elements of destruction on tne second
Rtory and perished before it was even
known that he was in the building. A
lodger named Kansauer leaped from a
third-story window and was severely,
though not fatally, injured.
â¢ The hotel was a three-story frame
building and was run under the manage
ment of Joseph Steiner. About half-past
11 ytsterday morning tire started in a room
c!. the second floor occupied by his chil
dren as sleeping apartments. After its
discovery it gained headway with almost
Incredible rapidity, and soon flames' were
crackling in every part of the structure.
As soon as it was known that the place
was ablaze every one rushed pellmell
through the lower part of the building
without giving a thought to ones who
might be on the upper floors. A baby
about 1 year of age was rsecued by the
heroic efforts of little Theodore Steiner,
wtto made hts way through the thick
smoke and flames to a room where the
child was sleeping, and carried it to the
door below. The youngster is but S years
of age. yet ventured into the building
when the stairway creaked under his
weight and when the fire lapped the walls
around him.
Neighbors who were first to reach the
scene asked the people in charge of the
place tf there was any one in the building.
Id their excitement they forgot old Mat
thius Eichorn and replied no. He was left
to his fate until it was too late to render
him any assistance. He was nearly SO
years of age and a cripple. His back was
bent and his limbs were partially para
lyzed. It is possible that he had suffi
cient time to escape, but hi- feeble condi
tion prevented it. Tl.e room occupied by
him was on the second floor in front. Af
ter the flre had left nothing but the
framework of the old building erect hts
body hung across the charred rafters in
slpht of the firemen and finally fell
through to the ground floor. It was
burned beyond recognition and only a por
tion of the head remained; the limbs were
entirely prone.
Henry Uansauer. an employe of the Cal
ifornia" Glue Works, was the only person
on the third floor when the cry of fire
was raised. When hf bolted into the hall
he found that it was already filled with
smoke, and. thinking that there was no
lie exit, rushed back into his room.
H<- then lost his head and leaped from a
window. He alighted on the roof of a
Bht '1 a few feet above the ground and
â was. picked up and taken to the Receiving
Hospital, lie w;\s injured across the
chest, but not internally. He will recover
shortly. While the lire was at its height
:t bux of cartridges exploded and bullets
whizzed in all directions. One of them
passed within an inch of Police Sergeant
Hlank's head and imbedded itself in a
fence across the street, while the others
made the crowd scatter.
Bnfitoe 13 was the first to reach the
scene, but the firemen seeing the hope
lessness of trying to save any part ol* the
burning structure, turned their efforts to
saving property in the vicinity. It was a
hard tight and several firemen were badly
burned in the attempt. Assistant Chief
Fernandez was burned about the hands
ami Firemen M. Wrtfeht. J. Cheseney and
Fred Wood of Truck 7 were scorched
about tho face.
The loss is estimated at about $.1000 of
v. hich Sl.'iOO will be recovered by insurance.
The building is owned, by Mrs. Theresa

lilT CHANGE
. . . ON . . .
KEARMSTREET.
Â»T THE CLOSE OF THE CENTEN-
. nial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876
the Vienna Model Bakery, which had
been the favorite lunch place at the great
fair, reopened in San Francisco, finding
favor at once with the public, and during
the twenty-three years of its existence
here maintained its popularity without a
rival.
Tho necessity for more modern and
commodious quarters has impelled the
proprietor to lease' and elegantly fit up
the premises on the northwest corner of
Post and Kearny streets, which are now
open. â 
Convenient to the library and shopping
center, ladies out during the day without
escorts will find this an Ideal luncheon
place. The new quarters of the Vienna
Model Bakery, are modern in all their ap-
pointments. The dining room will be on
the street floor, while the light and spa-
clous basement, furnished with the latest
appliances, insures a perfect sanitary
condition. â¢
The Vienna Model Bakery will continue
to be a place where one can get anything
from a good cup of coffee or chocolate or
plate of icecream to a regular dinner, well
cooked, properly served, and with, that
atmosphere of quiet and respectability
that has always made a meal here thor-
oughly enjoyable. V "â '..;<â -â .â 
The catering will be the special care of
the proprietor, Mr. Reinhold Beck, whose
forty years' experience in' the confection-
eries of Europe 'qualifies him to satisfy
the most fastidious tastes, an experience
that has made the Vienna Model Bakery
â ucce4ful and popular.
The Burning of the San Bruno Hotel Made a Corpse of a Cripple and a Hero of a Boy.
Krager and is located at 1540 San Bruno
avenue. It was built years ago and was
raised one story about three years back.
It has always been occupied as a hotel
and the rooms, there are about twenty,
are always occupied. It is fortunate that
the fire did not break out at night, for it
is almost a certainty that most of the oc
cupants would have become victims of the
flames.
Matches handled carelessly by some of
the younger children are supposed to have
been the cause of the conflagration.
The body of Eichorn was removed to the
Morgue. He \Vas a native of Sweden and is
a distant' relative to the proprietor of the
place.
FEARFUL FATE OF
A LITTLE CHILD
The alarm which came in at 4 o'clock
from box 257, Fillmore and Chestnut
streets, carried a message of death. It
was that of the little son of "Thomas TV. ]
Rollet, an employe of the Pacific Gas
Improvement Company.
Thomas Guthen, the superintendent, and
James Owens, the engineer, of the gas
works, observed the shed in the yard on
fire and rushed in to do what they could
to extinguish the flames. On looking into
the corner where the flre originated and
along the side of an oil barrel they saw
the body of a child, burned beyond recog
nition and almost to a cinder. . It was lit
tle Tommy Rollet. With tender hands
they lifted the little form from where it
lay under, an oil tank and took it to an
other part of the yard to render what aid
was possible, but the boy was dead. Only
a few minutes previously the child had
left his mother's house across 'the. street
and had entered the yard of the gas
company in search of amusement.
It is supposed that the child had pro
cured some matches at the house of his
mother,, and on entering the yard went
into the, corner under the shed,. where the
SoaÃed as They Were Io Oil, the Child's Clothes Burned
LiÃe a Torch.
oil barrel was, and in some way turned
on the fnucet, which permitted the oil
to flow, and while playing he struck a
match, which, igniting the oil, at once
enveloped him in the fury of its flames.
After the Fire Department had extin
guished the burning shed the Coroner's
office was notified and the Morgue wakon
hastened to the place arid removed what
whs left of the child's body.
The father of the boy had just returned
from a drive to the park when he was
greeted with the horrifying news. He
said that before leaving home he wanted
to take the litle fellow with him for a
ride, but it was finally decided to' leave
him behind.
Attempted Robbery.
L. H. Pierce, a laborer, was arrested

DAL HAWKINS IN TOWN.
Will Begin Training Wednesday for
His Go With Frank Erne.
Dal Hawkins arrived in the city yester
day from the East. He will begin train
ing Wednesday morning for his go with
Frank Erne, which will be on March 19.
Dal looks well and he says he was never
in better health or spirits. Speaking of
his approaching lierht with Erne the San
Francisco lad said:
"Erne is a good man, and our fight will
be a hot one. Naturally I expect to win,
and I shall train faithfully, so my friends
will know that I mean to win out when
I go into the ring, un my way home I
stopped at Spokane and Seattle and gave
an exhibition in each place."
Hawkins still regrets the loss of his
battle with Sullivan, and thinks he would
win if Me ever meets the Eastern light
weight again. If he wins from Erne he
Intends to take on Lavigne.
John Considine and Billy Dqnegan will
train Hawkins for his coming match.
Training quarters have not been decided
upon, but Dal thinks he will go out to
Ingleside.

Pickpockets ;' Arrested.
Gcorg-e Walton, alias Campbell , and
James Ryan, two well-known pickpock
ets, were arrested yesterday afternoon by
Detective Egan while working the crowds
at the Fillmore and Halght-street trans
fer point. They were locked up in "the
tanks" pending further Investigation as
to the results of their work.
BONDS ACCEPTED
FOR PICKPOCKETS
"AUSTRALIAN EDDIE" CANNOT
BE FOUND BY THE POLICE.
John Piggott Released in Less Than
an Hour After His Arrest Dur
ing the Early Morning
Hours.
Edward Brooks, better known as "Aus
tralian Eddie," one of the most notorious
pickpockets in the country, cannot be
found by the police, and the presumption
I is that he has betaken himself to more
congenial climes. Detectives Egan and
Gibson have been searching for him day
and night since Friday, but not a trace of
j him can be found.
Brooks was arrested Saturday, January
21, by Detective T. B. Gibson, after giving
the detective a sharp run and a' stubborn
fight. He was working the crowd at the
Orpheum when discovered. Three charges
of grand larceny wero booked against
him Monday, and Tuesday the cases were
called in Judge Graham's court, but were
continued until Friday. That day another
continuance was granted until "February
2. and at 6 o'clock that evening Brooks
was released on $3000 bonds, $1000 in each
c-.is*-. accepted by Clerk Kelly of Judge
Graham's court. The police learned of
his release some hours later, and then 'the
seach for him was commenced, as he is
a dangerous character to be at liberty
and ho could be arrested for vagrancy
The police have br-en as yet unable to as
certain whether the bonds are good but
this morning Bond Expert Newman will
be instructed to carefully examine them
and report the result.
As an evidence of the fact that people
of that class have a friend in Clerk Kollv
the case of John Piggott is cited. Pig
gott is a notorious pickpocket, and al
though arrested numerous times for
vagrancy and picking pockets, he has
always managed to beat the cases, much
to thft disgust of tho police. He was ar
rested yesterday morning on Ellis street
by Policeman Barney Harter for
vagrancy. He was booked at the City
Prison at 2:35 a. m. and at 3:30 a, m. he
was released on $300 bonds accepted by
Clerk Kelly. It is about the quickest
work on record, considering the hour of
arrest.

BOGUS COINS
IN HIS POCKETS
Arrest of a Supposed
Counterfeiter.
SEARCHING FOR THE PLANT
FREDERICK BOLENA LOCKED UP
IN THE TANKS.
Thought to Be the Man Who Has
Been Passing the "Queer" on
Unsuspecting Store
keepers.
The police believe they have the man
who has been passing bogus money on
unsuspecting storekeepers. During the
past few months a large amount of spuri
ous coins have been put in circulation
and, despite the efforts of the authorities,
the "shover of the queer" continued un
molested.
While patrolling his beat Saturday Po
lice Officer Chase saw a man who an
swered the description of the counter
feiter. He followed him for several
blocks and finally saw him enter a sa
loon on Third street between Mission and
Howard. Chase slipped into the saloon
unknown to the suspect and. as he ten
dered a quarter In payment for a drink
the officer picked up the coin and pro
ceeded to examine it. The suspect first
pretended to be indignant, but as the
officer discovered that the money was bo
gus, he feigned ignorance of that fact
and promised to return and settle for the
drink.
Convinced that he was the much-want
ed counterfeiter, Chase took him to po
lice headquarters, where he was subjected
to a thorough search. In one of his pock
ets was found $6 50 in bogus quarters and
half dollar pieces. When asked how he
had obtained possession of the counter
feit coins, the prisoner declared that he
had received them from a friend. He
gave his name as Frederick Bolena and
claimed that he had recently arrived
from the East.
The police yesterday endeavored to lo
cate Bolena's room, but without success.
They are satisfied that if they locate his
room they will discover a complete coun
terfeiter's outfit.
Bolena is a well-dressed man of about
40 years of age and is evidently of Span
ish extraction. He refuses to answer
questions, except to say that he is inno
cent of any wrong doing. To-day he will
be turned over to the United States au
thorities.
The bogus coins which were found in his
possession were evidently recently made.
The two-bit pieces are excellent imita
tions and could be passed without much
difficulty. -
Y. M. C. A/S FORTY
SIXTH ANNIVERSARY
APPROPRIATE EXERCISES HELD
IN ASSOCIATION HALL.
President John J. Valentine Tells of
the Good Work Done in thÂ©
Past Year by the Chris
tian Workers.
The forty-sixth anniversary of the T.
M. C. A. of San Francisco was observed
with appropriate exercises In the associa
tion auditorium at the corner of Mason
and Ellis streets yesterday afternoon. The
large hall was well filled and the audience
listened attentively to the addresses of
the speakers and joined heartily in the
singing of the choruses.
The Knickerbocker quartet furnished
excellent vocal music and among the
speakers were Rev. Dr. A. N. Carson,
Rev. Dr. John A. B. Wilson, President
John J. Valentine and Rev. Dr. E R
Dille.
In his review of the work of the assocl-
1 a o t rL or V> for .i he Â£ ear en dlng December 31,
1898, President Valentine declared that In
many respects the past year had been the
most remarkable in its history. He said
the receipts had exceeded expenditures
and although the excess on the credit side
of the ledger was small, it was neverthe
less extremely gratifying. The member
ship is large and interest in the work is
constantly expanding. The association
never had a stronger hold on the young
men, nor has its work ever been more im
peratively needed in the community than
to-day. The speaker referred to the work
among the railroad men and commercial
travelers, in the colleges and in the army
and navy. Speaking of the latter he said:
"The association was in touch with every
regiment organized, and its representa
tivesâpaid agentsâ went to the front with
every army corps and with every naval
expedition as well."
The total liabilities of the association
now amount to $202,492 70, with assets
$100,775 75. leaving the total net indebted
ness $101,716 95. President Valentine ex
pressed the hope that during the present
year sufficient Interest might be aroused
in the great city of San Francisco to in
duce its well-to-do citizens to discharge
the entire indebtedness of the association.
There is no doubt of the prosperous con
dition of the association, as the report of
the general secretary shows that notwith
standing the great number that have left
the city in the past year to go to the
Klondike or enter the army or navy, its
rolls are well filled and new members are
being received at the rate of about 100 a
month.
The anniversary address was delivered
by Dr. Dille. He spoke on "Young Man
hoodâlts Peril and Rescue," and he
handled his subject with rare tact and
eloquence, dilating on the dangers which
beset the path of the youth and urging
the necessity of providing proper safe
guards to protect them from temptation.
SCORES AT SCHUETZEN.
Inaugural Contest for the Prize Do
nated by J. L. Flood.
The first installment of the long horald
ed shoot of the California Schuetzen Club
for the 200 shares of stock in the Califor
nia Schuetzen Park Building and Loan
Association, donated by James L. Flood,
was furnished yesterday. Owing to the
funeral of the father of Judge Bahrs, who
was a member of the San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein, the attendance was
limited to about one-third the active
members of the club, but the weather was
propitious and those present made some
excelent scores.
C. J. Walden took the special prize of $5
for the best five shots on the ring target,
scoring 71. 69, 65, 64 and 62. The top scores
of the next six were as follows: A. Ber
telsen, 68; J. F. Robinson, 65; J. L. Utschig
Jr., 65; R. Langer, 59; A. Rahwyler, 56;
Philo Jacoby, 51.
'iiie first bullseyo and first score of
twenty-five was made by Fred Schumann.
R. Langer made the last bullseye of the
forenoon and the first of the afternoon.
The real contest will take place next
Sunday, but the scores made yesterday
will count then. President Jacoby has
arranged a special prize for the press.
Honoring bt. Savva.
The memory of St. Savva, the patron
saint of Servia, was fittingly celebrated
at the Russian Cathedral on Powell
street yesterday morning. A solemn high
mass was said in commemoration of the
great saint who traveled through Servia
and preached the word of God to the
then unchristianized of that land. As is
the custom with the Servian colony in
this city a banquet was given by the Ser
vian society on Saturday evening, at
which all of the leading members of the
society and their wives ana daughters
were present.

BURGLAR PAID
A VISIT TO
M. H. HECHT
Carries Off Some Val-
uable Jewelry.
THE FAMILY ALL AT DINNER
ENTRANCE EFFECTED THROUGH
AN OPEN WINDOW.
Intruder Left Much That Was Valu
able and Selected His Booty
With an Eye to the
Portable.
A daring burglar broke into the home of
Marcus H. Hecht, 2100 Washington street,
early Saturday evening, and is now richer
to the extent of - handsome Etruscan
gold watch, three valuable rings and J8 in
silver. The estimated value of the haul is
between $400 and $500.
According: to the belief of tho iamily the
burglary was committeed between 7 and 8
o'clock Saturday night. The watch,
which is of special value on account of its
rare novelty and artistic beauty, was in
the possession of Miss Grace Hecht as
late as a quarter, to 7 on the night of the
burglary. A half-hour later her maid dis
covered Its absence, but thinking that it
had been locked vr< by her mistress, made
no mention of this fact at the time. Miss
Hecht left the house at 7, went to the
theater and upon her return it was '*â¢ â i
first discovered that the house had been
burglarized.
The burglar operated while the family
was at dinner, and was evidently stopped
in his work. The watch was missed at
6:45 p. m., but one of the purses, the con
tents of which were appropriated by the
burglar, was not placed within his reach
until a half-hour later. He evidently in
vaded the premises, took the watch, se
creted himself until the family left the
house for the theater, and then finished
his work.
The entrance was effected by means of
an open window on the west side of the
house. The burglar then worked his way
down to the cellar, the doors of which, or
dinarily locked, were found open. From
the rear of the cellar is a staircase which
leads directly to the second floor of the
house, the one In which the sleeping
apartments are located. Miss Grace
Hecht's room was thoroughly explored
by the burglar and it is her property
which was taken. The only other room
visited by the housebreaker was that in
the front of the house on the other side
of Mrs. Hecht's room. It is a singular
thing that the burglar ignored the middle
room, in which some valuable jewelry
was lying about.
No sounds were heard, either by the
family or the servants, during the hours
when the robbery is supposed to have
been committed There were three ser
vants in the bouse during the entire even
ing and no disturbance of any kind was
noticed by them. . _
The silver ornaments and articles of a
similar nature which are fairly strewn
about both the rifled rooms were left in
tact. The police are now working on the
case.
Sold the Cigars He Stole.
Matt Gallagher, a boy 17 years or age,
â¢was booked at the City Prison yesterday
on a charge of burglary. He is accused
of breaking into the store of Marlow &
Stoddard, 5 Glasgow alley, a few nights
ago and stealing $150 worth of cigars
â¢which he sold in the neighborhood at a
reduced price.
