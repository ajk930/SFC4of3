THE PULPIT RISES IN PROTEST
OF THE CURSE OF INGLESIDE
The clergymen of this city have seldom given an expression of their intense interest in a measure of great public moment such as was voiced last
night by ministers of the Gospel, who, as by a common impulse, denounced the terrible evil of horse-racing gambling, and called upon the Supervisors to
stand by their determination to kill the devastating scourge of the racecourse, once and for all, in this city.
In every part of the city clergymen spoke in earnest pleading for the proposed ordinance. Every Christian creed was represented in the crusade.
In support of a great public cause, in scathing condemnation of a great evil that has been raised to the bad dignity of a public curse, creeds were forgotten
and ministers of every denomination found a common ground in the defense of morality.
The spectacle was as unusual as it was impressive. Tens of thousands of men, women and children were addressed and listened to the dark story
of Ingleside as clergymen know it in disgraced men, dishonored women, corrupted children and wrecked homes. Picturing this story of the curse of the
racecourse in San Francisco, these ministers of God called upon the Board of Supervisors to resist the temptations that may be held forth and, in making the
new ordinance a law, earn the gratitude of all who seek the welfare of the city.
This plea is made on the eve of the day when the Supervisors meet to confirm or dishonor their own action. In support of the law the Supervisors
have element of decency, morality and good government. Arrayed against the ordinance are professional bribe takers and givers, gamblers and blacklegs.
The Supervisors will decide with their votes this afternoon under whose colors they wish to serve.
"HOMES DESTROYED (\ND LIVES BLIGHTED."
In the course of his sermon
ast evening Rev. Dr. E. Ne
ander, pastor of the First Ensr
ish Lutheran Church, said:
"We all admire the horse.
We do not believe a horse's
speed is necessarily a sin. But
â¢why should the speed of the
horse be cultured at the ex
pense of human degradation.
The evil begins when th^ bet
ting begins â when fast horses
make fast men. Only those
people who have investigated
the subject have any Idea of
he magnitude of poolroom
gambling in our city. Young
men and boys make ud the
multitude of the patrons of the
poolrooms. Our prisons are full
of men who ascribe their for
gery, thefts and embezzlements
to their infatuation f r pool
room gambling. No form of
gambling offers such tempta
tions, and the very fact that it
requires po little money is why
the first theft from employers is
so easily made. Superintendent
Byrnes of New York City said:
â¢We are sending men to prison
right along on account of the
race gambling craz-.' Personally I know of homes in San Franei^o
that have been destroyed and the lives of young men blighted in the
â a training sohnols of forgery and defalcation.

"IT IS HIGH TIME TO KILL THE GIONT EVIL."
The Rev. Dr. J. N. Beard. $
pastor of Grace MethodiFt â¢?
Episcopal Church, denounced g
with unqualified vehemence last p
night the giant twin evils of Â£
b-okmakins? and poolselling. S
The reverend speaker called p
upon the Supervisors to sus- Â£
tain the action aiready so well p
taken an " to destroy the privi- <%
leges of the gamblers. In sub- *c
stance the pastor spoke as fol-
"I havp supposed that all X
right-thinking people, what- Â£
ever their creed or consistency O
on other matters, could agree
that gambling, even in its more oÂ»
private phases, is evil and only <>
evil. But when it is elevated to â¢*
an institution, shamelessly and -f
gaudily advertised and system- O
at: "ally used to debauch, not
only men, but women and chil- 4 Â«
dr-n as well, it is time for O
public sentiment to assert
itself. I have no sympathy with ..â¢
the mention of business' in O
connection with all this pool-
selling and bookmaking, which ,*
neither make goods nor facili- 9
"-' -ate equitable exchange. I have little personal acquaintance with our g
Â«< present Board of Supervisors, but from their standing as business men gj
H and from the position which I suppose most of them occupy as heaÂ«l.-- H
'â¢'â ' of families, I cannot seÂ»? how they can lend their official sanction to g
\ racetrack gambling, any more than they could vote to establish in our # Â«
midst a Monte Carlo or Baden Baden. S

"THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IS ON TRIOL "
Rev. H. T. Shepard, pastor of
Olivet Congregational Church. *â¢
. . .- â  _ prayed last night that the Board Â£>
of Supervisors should remain Â£jj
firm in their purpose to stamp V,
out the evil of gambling and be Â£Â£
true to their colors as servants Â£>
of the public will. When his i?
prayer was concluded he spoke S
as follows: Â£Â£
"To-morrow shall bean event- â â¢?
ful day for the city of San Fran- H
clsco. Before another sun shall <âº
have passed to its setting those S3
in whose hands we have - in- j~
trusted the safety of our public Â£>
morals will have had an op- ,?
portunity of lifting a curse from Â£
our midst or strengthening the 3
meshes which entangle thou- _ig
sands of our people in the throes '1>
of degradation and despair. 8
"We shall watch our Board of So
Supervisors. They are our ser- &
vants, and when the sentiment- $.
of the people shall have been 8?
made known to them' they are H
bound to do its bidding. The 0
wish of the people is that the â¢Â§
gambling incident to t. ; horse 2
racing at Ingleside shall be S
abolished, and to our city â¦*
fathers we look for the sustain- S
ing of the resolution recently f?
introduced by Dr. Perrault. Â§ **
"I speak in words of love as Â§?
well as law. W.e have seen the #
vitals sapped from our youths, who have fallen from positions of confl- â¢?
dence and of trust. We have seen our daughters descend to prostitu- Â£$
tion and the fathers of our homes starve their offspring that they Â£,
might fill the coffers of the Ingleside bookmakers. Under our own &
observation thousands of lives have been blignted and homes depraved. v
This is the time for action. . â¢ \ 8

"THE RACECOURSE WS BECOME HfICELDfIMA-THE FIELD OF BLOOD."
One of the most scathing denun- iations and most complete ar
raignments of the race course and ts manifold evils was given yes
terday by the Rev. Father Mac- orry of the Paulist Fathers of this
city. " The reverend gentleman is horoughly informed on the terrible
subject and his words are worthy f the most serious consideration.
In part Father MacCorry spoke as ollows:
â It seems to me that one point at east has been conclusively demon
strated by The Call in its present iscuesion of the gambling: plague:
that the race track as It is here and ow conducted is an unmitigated
curse. "Now in saying this there is in
tended no unqualified attack or in- lscriminate assault upon the turf.
A race course can be maintained long the lines of right and moral
principles. The cultivation of a wift-hoofed horse, it seems to me.
is in itself commendable: and to lace a prize within the reach of
the fleetest racer is quite as blame- pss as to reward a farmer who
grows good wheatâ or to give a cube of sugar to our best-conducted
child. That is one way of stimulat- ng progress and developing our
race '-But in racing as in other games
of risk, the sin begins where the rambling begins, and there is little
doubt that with us the gambling has closely approached the
proportions of a national calamity. " In one >' ear ln * ew * or ]L Cl * y
there were seven million dollars laeriflced at the poolrooms-fifty to
a hundred thousand dollars chang- hands at single race tracks .in a
single day. It is estimated that in this country there are three thou
sand five hundred professional gamblers scattered up and down
and across the land. That means professional plunder, professional
rapine, professional theft. Ind- dentally it means three thousand
five hundred people banded in syst ematic warfare to wreck our
homes and make paupers of our children.
â¢To me there is no other human passion so desperately cruel. Once
let its fire charge the blood and there are no depths to which it will
not lower, no cruelty at which it Is appalled, no threat of the Lord God
Almighty that it will not dare. "That to me is the most terrifv
inKfeatur- ..f the vice: it is so piti- !â¢"â¢ Â«> merciless and eft-.*', that
once its victim gets grapplr-d by its tyranny and well under way on the
downward track, it srinetimes seems that man or devil cannot make him stop.
"A gambler sees th dissioation is making shipwreck of his home: that his life is an abiding periurv
against his marriage vow: that his dwds are daggers in c rt of ttre, woman he has made his wife: that his
sons have the taunt of their father's debauchery thrown in their faces: that his daughters par out into life
with the stigma of a disreputable parent on their names. An appreciation of it all breaks in upon him. He
tries to stop. He clutches desperately at the landmarks of a Christian life. But the fire is in his blood and
the madness in his brainâ and it does seem sometimes that he simply cannot stopâ the infatuation is so piti
less, so desperate and strong.
â¢ Mind you, I say nothing against the horse, nothing against the turf, nothing against the tracks as such.
But this I say, that all three have been prostituted and abused until the word 'Racecourse* painted above the
gates should better read 'Haceldamaâ that is to say, 'The Field of Blood."
"Any movement, then, tha*. will save men's souls from such disaster must needs be right. The racing in
terests have, I know, tremendous resources as potent arguments to prove the present movement wrong. But
never mind! We have much faith that the men at present in public office can well be trusted with our children's
safety and the public weal, as their stand and votes on the present question, I am sure, will tell."
'CRUSH OUT ITS WICKED LIFE UNDER THE MUNICIPAL HEEL."
One of the most stirrine con- demnations of the racing evil was
that delivered last night by the RÂ« v - William Rader, pastor of the
Third Congregational Church. The reverend gentleman begged the Su
pervisors in behalf of everything decent to make the proposed ordi
nance a law. In part the reverend gentleman spoke as follows:
"I have been asked, with other clergymen, to say a word on the
evils of the Ingleside racing track. and to lend the support of this
church to the efforts now being made by our Supervisors to control
the great spider of our city, which is weaving its nefarious web over
our social and business life. "A spider is not to be controlled
except for scientific purposes, but killed if poisonous: that is the only
sensible thing to do with the Inele- Bide race track. The Supervisors
could do no better thing for the re- spectable portion of the community
that to crush out its wicked life un- der the municipal heel.
"Ingleside is a disgrace to the city, a dishonor to the State, a
wrecker of homes, a despoiler of womanhood, an enemy to business.
a rendezvous of the worst element of society, a breeder of murders,
bankruptcy, divorces, chicanery. clandestine meetings, Inancial ruin,
dishonesty and the spirit of gam- bling.
"No other city in the land ocr- mits such a foul and vicious mon
ster to continue so long with such brazen disrespect of law, decency
and respectability. "Down with it! Its excuse for
existing is conceived in the passion tor gambling. The whole object of
the thing is rotten through and through. Its influence upon the
city is damaging to the treme. No defense can be made in its be
h. " It is self-condemned. It is a public enemy thus far protected
by law. The Call of this city has recently published a long list of the
reported victims of â¢ Ir.:r!eside track and of the downtown pool
rooms, but The Call .v Wished only a part of the bloody record. Every
pa: tor in the city . iuld acM to the sensational evidence, brandin- the
racing business as the chief evil of San Francisco.
'"The ministers are often remind- ed of the ruin â¢ homes, loss of sit
uations, corrupted and penniless husbands and ruined sons aid
daughtezs. If the rue sto â¢ Ingleside were told I- would make a chapter of - -1 life which we id horrify
the city and compel the Supervisors at their meeting to-morrow night to put a lock which no man cot .d
br ak with money or politics upon the gates of Ingleside, and every offlCf would be compelled to enforce the
po> -oom ordinance downtown.
"I do not hesitate to say th: the Ingleside evil, with its associated vices, is the greatest enemy to the mor
:ty and good order of our city. Crrnh it out! I hope the Sui rvisors will not scotch but kill the thing. It
has been kicked ov. â  the land, from State to State, and -- -n city to city, until at last we give it refuge and
sanction it with our hosp table laws. Shame on us! Why should California be the garbage receptacle for the
United States? Why should San Francisco tolerate annually a horde of loafers who are the bloodsucker 1 - of so
ciety? It is true that many remain here â in our prisons, as the court records show; but why sh :ld we tol
fe such a nuisance? *
"It is the clear duty of the people to speak, that the ramblers may not do all the talking. The contest is
between the gamblers and the resDec table portion of the community. The Board of Supervisors is on trial.
The issue is before us and we are to see what kind of metr.l we have in our Supervisors.
"Therefore let public opinion reinforce theiÂ». Let pulpits and churches be heard. Let every mother who
loves her sons and daughters, every merchant who would trust his clerk and every citizen who believes in
municipal self-respect support the Supervisors in their first great battle with the worst element in the city, and
earnestly work for the ultimate destruction of this disgraceful parasite of the State of California and the City of
San Francisco."
The battle that will be fought to-day in the chamber of the Board of
Supervisors will be one of the greatest ever lost or won in San Francisco.
The gamblers of the racecourse and their allies, the blacklegs of the pool
rooms, have united to save bookmaking and poolselling from destruction in
this city, These combined forces possess enormous influence. They want
the proposed ordinance modified or action postponed. They have wealth and
corrupt power to support their tiemand.
Opposed to them, and as solidly united, are all decent classes in the
community. Merchants and workingmen, employes and employers, bankers,
clerks, clergymen, the press and the pulpit, are combined in earnest, per
sonal support of the final adoption and operation of the prohibitory ordinance.

| 'THE CURSE MUST BE DESTROYED IN THIS CITY.":
The Rev. John Stephens,
pastor of the Simpson
Methodist Episcop 1 Church,
spoke eloquently and earnestly
yesterday upon the great curse
of the track and the necessity
for its destruction. In part the
reverend gentleman spoke as
follows:
"The gambling queition has
become unusually prominent
during the past week through a
resolution passed to print by our
Board of Supervisors. It aims at
the eradi--*" of poolroon* and
racetrack gambling within the
confines of the city. This reso
lution comes up for h.ial con
sideration to-morrow. Its pas
sage will be most desperately
resisted by the fraternity. They
claim it means the death of
racing in San Francsco, for
racing without gambling is a
financial impossibility. Very
well; let racing' cease and the
habitues of the track depart and
our city will be well rid of these
unsavory characters.
"It is not astonishing our mu
nicipal authorities should take
such a step as is proposed if
they have the slightest regard for tne weuare 01 me community wnoso
affairs they are elected to control. One can only marvel at the moral in
sanity of our State Legislature that rejected a very mild measure in
tended to grant relief from conscienceless harpies that prey upon the
prosperity and happiness of our people. With amazing servility the ma
jority knuckled down to these corrupt powers who know so well tie po
litical ways that are dark and tricks that are vain.
"Seneca said of ancient gambling places that they were houses not
afraid of magistrates. Too long has this vice snapped its fingers at the
authorities and defied the moral sentiment of the community. New Jer
sey, New York and Connecticut have driven the gamblers out. and
through California's open door they have come in droves to destroy our
youth and corrupt our people's morals.
"The history of their presence, here Is one of murder, suicide, embez
zlement and every kindred crime. The Superintendent of of New
York City, who evidently thinks the soul of a young man is worth more
than a fast horse, said: 'It would be well to stop racing altogether.
Actual experience has satisfied me that no form of gambling offers
greater temptations to young men to take what is not theirs.' Senator
Chauncey M. Depew declares 'ninety per cent of the defalcations and
thefts and ruin of youths among people who are employed in places of
trust are due directly to gambling. I have come to believe that the com
munity which tolerates public gambling cannot have prosperity in busi
ness, religion in its churches or morality among its people.' Yet we as
a city have meekly submitted to rest under this curse. Ancient Egypt
banished gamblers to the quarries. Let a long-suffering people arise now
to declare that these ministers of crime must either amend their ways
and turn to honest means of livelihood or take their departure, bag and
baggage, from our midst."
"THE INFAMIES fIND CRIMES OF THE RfICE TRACK";
Dr. Alexander N. Carson,
in the Trinity Presbyterian
Church, corner of Twenty-third
and Capp streets, spoke last
night in part as follows on the
"unutterable iniquities, infa
mies and crimes" of the race
course:
"We live in a city that in part
supports two large racetracks
for six or eight months in the
year. Chicago and New York,
each place much larger than
San Francisco and Oakland to
gether, have only two months
of racing:. We are a city of
gamblers imbued with a desire
to make money easily and rap
idly, hence our two flourishing
racecourses. I am told that
often the poolmen here han
dle as much as $80,000 in one
racing day, and that the quar
ter of a million dollars invested
at Ingleside was all returned to
the investors in two seasons.
Think of $250,000 taken from the
dupes, men, women and chil
dren, in two seasons. O Lord,
how long will such conti. .c?
"To-morrow the Board of Supervisors will vote to abolish the devil
ish evil. After its terrible arraignment of horseracing it cannot do less
than sweep it out of this county for good. It is debauching manhood,
womanhood and even childhood.
"No poet has ever described, no painter has ever pictured, no actor
has ever represented the unutterable iniquities, infamies, crimes and
agonies that attend the awful and infernal practices growing out of
these racecourses. It is a perpetual outrage upon every holy instinct
and upon every feeling of humanity. From beginning to end there is
not one redeeming feature in this deadly business. Occasionally some
open atrocity takes place which finds voice and is heralded hrough the
land. But how many thousands and tens of thousands of crimes are
instigated by this foul spirit of hell which are never reported? Only
the eye of God can see the woe and pain and sorrow and shame which
is endured by their hapless victims. He will eventually bl?st and de
stroy the men who aid, abet and countenance this most iniquitous
work. This is the business the State refuses to put a stop to, and
thereby in a sense throws its protection about it. ,
"This is the business that would rule politics and with unlimited
capital purchase venal politicians, dictate United States Senators, crush
out men of responsibility and integrity, fight against the gospel of the
son of God, trample beneath its unclean hoofs every high and holy am
bition of the human race, pull down from their lofty position statesmen,
rulers and men of every grade in life and consign them to pauperism,
degradation, crime and death.
"This is the business that would destroy our children, darken our
homes and polute our land. Shall this curse devour forever? 'How
ing, O Lord, how long?"

CHURCH ARRAYED AGAINST THE GAMBLERS.
i"RfILLY TO THE SUPPORT OF THE SUPERVISORS, "j
At the Howard-street Meth
odist Episcopal Church last
night the pastor, Rev. Dr. uohn
A. B. Wilson, in prelude to his
sermon on "How to Be Born
Again" spoke in part as fol
ows:
"At ono important point in
wide open town the Super
iors have called a halt upon a
firiety of infamy by passing an
ordinance against pool selling
upon races.
"A year ago one of honorable
ineage, prominent in " society
and holding a high fiduciary
position, went down under the
ntluence of this fascination and
s now a criminal. But how
many hundreds of less promi
nent persons have committed
embezzlement, led on by this
ame infatuation? Th^ action
>f the Supervisors is ;: Step In
he right direction. But if they
pul teeth into this ordinance
and secure a rigid enforcement,
t will raise a storm from the
thieves and cutthroats that
manage this business that will make necessary the raiiying of all moral
mdfi of dollars in this thievery that has
bo long been ;â  '>d they will spend tens of thousands to .secure
al of the ordinance or to prevent its enforcement. Or, failing in
both, to ruin our Incorruptible officials. I put this pulpit to-night in
nomination to supp it the Supervisors in their good work. 1 call upon
you. my people, to give heartily and grandly your mural support to
these officers who seem alive to their responsibility. The newspapers
are in line, and if the newspapers and pulpits and Christian people
stand by them in every way possible and proper, even the money of
these gamblers will fail to buy immunity for the furtherance of this
ii' farioue business.
â¢The utter and hopeless demoralization of gambling cannot be
overestimated. It means ruin both to the guilty and to the innocent.
Let every believer in a cleaner city give his moral support to the Su
pervisors who have had the courage to open the fight upon this gang
of miscreants. But the cure for this and other sins is not in palliative
methods. The radical remedy is the new birth. 1 call your attention
to the subject of the evening, 'How to Be Born Again.' 'For except
a man be born of water and of the spirit, ye cannot see the kingdom of
God. 1 (John lli:14.)"
Rev. J. A. B Wilson, Howard-Street M. E.
Church.
"MORE POWER TO THOSE THAT ORE IN THE FIGHT
â  - fa H i
The Rev. J. George Gibson,
> preaching last night, took for
> his text the words in Proverbs,
' xiv:l2. 'There is a way which
j seemeth right unto a man; but
[ the end thereof are the ways of
| death." Referring to the race
j track he said:
j "Every good Christian should
I rejoice that the fight against the
5 racetrack has begun. There
| never was a sadder and truer
j article than appeared in The
I Call last week. If any disease
\ laid low so many people we
; would all be taking measures
! against it. This racetrack has
f been allowed to go on for years.
' Our boys Have been leaving the
| churches, women their homes
> and men their offices. People
> have tried to convince me
> that Pan Francisco contained
> so many poor people. I could
: not believe it when I lived on
Mission street and saw the cars
carry their thousands of pas
sengers to the races. But as
they passed people were pointed
out to me who had not paid
their rent, nor paid for their
clothes, nor even for their food.
In debt, yet going to the races!
"Young men have not enough money to gamble. They borrow and
steal, hoping to pay back before discovered. But the races are not con
ducted on the principle that the many will make money. The few grow
rich, the many become poor. This Is the plan. It is evident, everybody
knows it, yet people get such a love of the races that they will go. Ex
cept for the excitement they might as well fling their money in the tire
and watch it melt. Gambling is called a delusion. There is no delusion
"about it. People like to be foaled. The deep desire to get something for
nothing is at the bottom of it all. Even some of our church people are
"touched with this desire. If we called cmr church rolls and asked each
one if he had ever bought a lottery ticket the answer might surprise us.
"It is time we were setting our face against gambling In all its forms.
To see the women and girls hanging on the cars and sitting on the Bteps
as they go to the races is a vision to sadden any sensible heart. How our
American women are changing: In a few years will it be possible to
find a woman who loves her home and think? it an honor to be a good
wife and mother? And as the girls degenerate so do the boys. Return
ing horn? a little boy said: 'Mother. I saw a man selling his coat at the
â  races.' Yes, but it is a question many a time of selling a life. More

feeling of complacency on her
victories over the darkness o'J the past, ut when sh* turns her eyes on
the raceir. ''':s of our city and their nefarious gamblings she must
blush deeply with shame. Will you picture to yourself the farts as
they are? Young men just starting in life who ought to be laying the
foundation for a successful life and a happy home by saving their
earnings and Improving their time, think of them spending much of
that valuable time by dabbling in race pools, think of them spending all
their spare money on dog races?
"Ah. that is not the worst, for when their own money fails too often
their employers' is turned into the same channel of hell, and then be
gins the rapid descent that ends in defeat, financial, intellectual and
moral. Worse still, too often the married man's hard earnings that
ought to go to feed his children go on the swift wings of the race.
Worse still is the fact that the mother, the intended goddess of the
home and molder of the young lives intrusted to herâ she who ought
to be the glory of humanityâ is found debasing herself by dabbling in
this crude and savage pool gambling. Oh, mothers, do you think more
of the dog race than the child of your breast?
"At these pool gamblings young girl* are seduced into lives of
shame, families are wrecked and homes are ruined. This nefarious
practice of pool gambling is a menace to all honest business enter
prise and stifling to all honest individual effort; it strikes at the foun
dation of all morals and is an enemy that must be throttled if we
would save thousands of our young men from the vagrant's life. In
the name of the God of honest, in tho name of religion, in the name
of civilization, In the name of fair San Francisen, the pearl of the
Pacific, in the name of all that Is noble and elevating, let us trample to
the death this writhing, poisonous serpent of hell."
Rev. J. George Gibson.
Among the many local
clergymen wh<-> addressed their
congregations last night on the
horrors of the race ourse was
the Rev. W. E. Dugan. pastor
of the Stewart Memorial United
Presbyterian Church. In the
course of his sermon the rev
erend gentleman said:
"I am glad that a movement
is being inaugurated against
race gambling in our city. The
city authorities seem to be
aroused on the subject and The
Call is making a commendable
attack against this horrible

of the pulpit and Christian
people to unite with the press

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 13, 1899.
7 HOPE THIS EVIL WILL RECEIVE ITS DEATH BLOW.'
The Rev. Frederic C. Lee, pas
tor of the California -street Meth-
odist Church, added his words
yesterday to the crusade of the
clergymen against the Ingleside
racecourse. The reverend gentle
man spoke in part as follows:
"Ingleside or the right side â
which?
"All hail to our Board of Su
pervisors. All honor to Dr. Per
rault for his resolution concern
ing Ingleside and its 'pools,' into
which plunge men and women,
youth and innocence.
"Perhaps not any one of these
gentlemen will care one whit about
my commendation, but it is no
more than fair play for us to ex
press our approval, and for the
public to show its appreciation,
when our city officials do the
right thing. While we are so
quick to find fault and say sharp
things let us also be quick to
recognize the right and not be too
stinted in our praise. That the
racetrack gambling is a curse that
rests upon our city like a blight
cannot be denied. That it has been
rf-sponpible for the downfall of more men and women than any other one
evil in the community the police and penitentiary records can prove. I
wish it to be distinctly understood that I have nothing: of the narrow
gauge, single track in my make-up.
â¢â I do not expect the city of San Francisco to be run under the
Methodist discipline. I recognize that the discipline is for those who
want it. My right leaves off just where the right of somebody else be
gins. I am free to confess that like the majority of Methodist minis
ters lam fond of a good horseâ a two-thirty one preferred. I do not
deny that there is a large amount of honest fun and excitement in a
genuine horse race. If I was on the road and another man tried to give
me his dust the only way he could do so would be by having a horse that
trotted in a faster class than mine.
'There is a silly impression abroad among Christians and non- f
Christians alike that whatsoever things are stupid, whatsoever things are
slow whatsoever things are dull and dyspeptic, out of date and behind
the age are pre-eminently pious and Christian; that everything religious
is in slow metre and carried on to the tune of the 'Dead March in Saul.'
Therefore the preacher in riding his circuit should drive a ring-boned,
spavined, sprained, coffin-jointed 'skate.' This same reasoning would
compel Christians to cross the ocean in a tramp sailing vessel in place of

"Is it any more impious to ride behind a horse going in 2:10 than it
is to ride behind a locomotive going at the rate of 1:50? Nonsense!
Sleepiness is not synonymous with sanctity. Laziness is not to be mis
taken for piety. Christian character is not developed or improved by urg
ing a broken-winded 'Dobbin' over a corduroy road at the rate of three
miles an hour. We have fast yachts, fast steamships, fast trains, fast
cruisers. By all means let us have fast horses! Let us have improve
ment all along the line. Breed better stock and increase their useful
ness at every possible point. More eggs from our hens, more wool from
our she,ep, more milk from our cows, more beef from our steers, more
speed from our horses. But no one will make the pretense that this is
being done at Ingleside. In place of improving the animal it degrades
the human. Horses here are merely the gambler's toolsâ his loaded dice
and 'brace box,' with which he robs his victims. Here man's best friend
is turned into his worst enemy, which. Mazeppa-like, dashes away with
him to shame and ruin. I hope our honorable body of Supervisors will
at their session to-morrow give this evil its death blow. Then let the
bpttf>r element of our city come to the support of the Supervisors and
demand that this law be enforced to the very letter; that our police be
compelled, by the force of public sentiment, to enforce the law and shut
up these deadfalls and not wink at the violation of the law in letter and
in spirit.
"What we need in our city (as needed in every city) is not more law,
but a fnithful enforcement of the laws we have. I find that it costs the
taxpayers of San Francisco nearly one million dollars every year to fun
its police force and Police Courts, and what are we getting in return?
Are there fewer criminals than there were five or three years ago? Are
there fewer places of evil resortâ where crimes are brooded and hatched
by the black breast of lust and greed? Are the number of brothels,
gambling dens and opium joints less than before? If not, then in the
name of outraged decency and slaughtered innocence, what are we pay
ing for?
."Simply for the privilege of being allowed to live? Thankful for not
being dragged from our beds at midnight, or murdered in broad day
light upon the streets? Is the entire population criminal? Is it half
criminal? Is it not true that the number of professional crooksâ the real
criminal classâ is only a very small proportion of the population? Does
it not appear, then, that there is "something rotten in Denmark' when so
small a minority can terrorize over so large a majority and compel the
honest, industrious, law-abiding citizen to pay so high a price for the
peace and protection â which he does not get?
"Are the number of murders any less? Are the crimes against life
and property any less than they were a year ago? If not, why not? Is
it not true that the police know every crook and blackleg in town? Have
they net his photo and record in their possession? Do they not know
every dive, dope den' and gambling hell in the entire city? If not, why
not? I stand here to say that a Chief of Police wearing no one's tag. and
calling no man master, such a Chief could clean up two-thirds of the
open shame and secret vice of our city, or else let his employersâ the
people â know the reason why.
"Again I say, all hail to our Supervisorsâ may they complete that
which they have begun. Three cheers for Dr. Perraultâ may his tribe
increase!"
"LET NOT THE PLEA BE IN VAIN."
Rev. Dr. Woods is giving, at
the First Baptist Church, a
course of Sunday evening ser
mons on the life of Christ. Last
evening his subject was "'Christ's
Throne of Judgment." In a pre
lude to his sermon he spoke of
the Supervisors and the race
track something as follows:
"The resolutions prohibiting
betting at the racetracks 'and
coursing parks of this city which
were introduced and 'passed to
print' by our Supervisors last
week certainly commend them
selves to all good citizens.
"It is true here, as in other
cities, that this custom has re
sulted in loss of character and
financial ruin to large numbers
of young men and in debauch
ing young girls and women who
bat for this influence would have
been virtuous and respectable
members of society. This is a
growing evil in this city, and the
number of boys and young men
who are coming under its influ
ence is very large.
"The ordinary gambling dens
are outlaws and hide themselves
in dark corners out of sight and
knowledge of the general public.
But the betting ring is by far a
greater evil. It does not hide
itself, but openly and above board it does its work. Women and boys, as
well as men, are' being corrupted by it. Betting at the racetracks is In
fact a school of instruction in gambling. This work is carried on In vio
lation of law and our Supervisors have the power to crush this giant
evil, and with the po-vver there is the responsibility for its use. It is
their duty to guard the Interests of this city. It is not the guilty, hard
ened ones who are the greatest sufferers, but innocent women and chil
dren.
"I believe it Is the duty of every Christian minister to speak out
boldly concerning this terrible evil. It is surely the duty of all go<rd
citizens to join in this demand for the suppression of this source of pollu
tion ar>', iln.
"T> Ifo press has the power to mold public opinion to a large
degree. L.i â  hope that It will speak â with one voice in favor of the
action proi bed by the Supervisors, Let all who have the good of our
city at heart unite In creating a public sentiment which will not tolerate
this ruinous vice.
"Gentlemen of the Beard of Supervisors, we urge you fearlessly to
perform the duty you owe to this community. Your responsibility is
great; the power 1b in your hands; the youth and the homes of our fair
city make to you their plea for protection. Let not their plea be in
vain,"

JAPAN WILL HAVE

Unfounded Rumor That the Island
Empire Was to Adopt
Christianity.
WASHINGTON, March 12.â Much in
terest was manifested to-day in reports
to the effect thnt the Japanese Govern
ment is discussing a plan to adopt
Christianity as the state religion. So
far as it has boon ascertained, however,
the statement lacks credibility or
foundation In fact. The published re
port was to-night shown to Jutaro Ko

asked to make a statement on the sub
ject. In reply, through an attache, he
spoke substantially as follows:
"The statement t*'Â»t Japan is dis
cussing a plan to adopt Christianity
as its state religion is not true, and
there is 'no possibility of this beincr
done. Unlike Russia. England and
other European countries, the Japan
ese Government has no state religion,

liberty to exercise its functions so long
as it does not interfere with or dis

UPRISING OF MOROS
ON PALAWAN ISLAND
TACOMA, March 12.â Advices by the steamship Victoria from the
Orient state that Spanish avarice and misrule have again stirred up a
rebellion in the Philippines. The insurgent Moros of Palawan Island
on the edge of the Philippine group, north of Borneo, found an oppor
tunity t<> strike their oppressors late in January and seized ir. They
â¢ murdered the Spanish Governor of Palawan, residing at Port Royalist
and killed his assistants. His head was severed from his body and car
ried back into the hills to Incite a rebellion among the natives, who had
previously feared Spain's power. Church and other Spanish buildings
were burned, aftor which the rebellious Moros retreated to the hills of
Palawan, carrying with them several dozen men, women and children,
all Spaniards, as prisoners. Tf they are pursued these prisoners will be
held as hostages.
This news comes from Singapore, where it was cabled from Labuan,
capital of British North Borneo. It was brought there by the British
steamship Labuan, whose master. Captain Pfort, made an Investigation
at Port Royalist. He interviewed natives as to the cause of the insur
rection, learning that onerous taxes and other burdens imposed by the
Spanish had caused the natives to strike a blow for freedom. H<- also
found that the Spanish mail steamship which called at Port Royalist
after the massacre did nothing except to make inquiries. Pfort brought
away the Governor's wife, several other women and children, a priest and
twelve soldiers, who were landed at Sandakan.

! Knowing the value of the pioneers I saw,
each of those soldiers, young, vigorous
and used to this climate, by remaining
here, will be of inestimable value to their
country. The only way to Americanize in
these islands is the example of the Amer

CHRISTIAN IA, March 12. â Norwegians are not pleased with the temporary govern
ment of the Crown Prince, who is much stricter than his father and has not shown that
he will not allow Norwegians any little demonstrations of '"independence." He has de
cided that Sweden and Norway will send only one representative to the peace congress at
the Hague. This representative will probably be a Swede.
Some days ago war between Sweden and Norway was hinted at during a debate in the

The Minister of War hotly contradicted the statement, and several other members also crit

THE SCENE.
Will Investigate the County Bank's
Affairs, and It May Be Per

Business.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, March 12.â Bank
Commissioner A. W. Barrett and C.
H. Dunsmoor, secretary of the Bank
Commission, arrived here this evening
and had a long preliminary conference
with R. E. Jack of the County Bank
of San i-uis Obispo. It was finally de
cided to hold a meeting to-morrow for
the purpose of examining into the af
fairs of the institution. This examina
tion, which will mean an inspection of
the books of the bank as well as an
investigation of its methods of busi
ness, may occupy two or more days.
On the result will depend the future of
the bank. It is possible the institu
tion may be permitted to resume busi
ness should its suspension have been
due only to natural causes absolutely
beyond the control of its directorsâ
that is, to the poor seasons produced
by lack of rain and the consequent in
ability to dispose of available assets
in the shape of real estate. But even
it the Bank Commission should be of
a mind to make concessions that would
allow the embarrassed institution to
resume business after satisfactory ar
rangements with its reditors. the di
rectors may. according to remarks
made by Cashier Jack, decide to go
into general liquidation and close its
affairs for good.
The imetin? of the directors of the
Commercial Bank, which had been an
nounced for to-day, was deferred un
til to-morrow.
Commissioner Barrett was inclined to
look upon the situation as being de
void of dangerous features so far as
financial circles are concerned.
â "There is no occasion for any alarm
in regard to banks in general," he
said. "The suspension of the three
banks in this county, so far as we have
bpen able to ascertain at this time, is
due entirely to local cay cs â the lack
of sufficient rain. We have recently ex
amined the banks south of the Teha
chapi and found thei all sound and
in very ood condition, with ample
cash funds on hand o meet every pos
sible demand."
The latter statement was evoked by
a remark that the entire southern Dor
tion of the State wâ suff_-ing from
th^ almost unprecedented drought
and was made to show that the finan
cial situation there was not in any
sense acute.
As soon as the affairs of the County-
Bank have been dispct-ed of those of
the Commercial Bank will be taken in
hand by the Bank Commissioner.

Intelligence That the Tokio Govern
ment Is Considering a Plan as
to Religion.
NEW YORK. March 12.â The Jouranl
says: Dispatches from Tokio received ir>
this city to-day bring the startling intelli
gence that the Japanese Government is
discussing a plan to make Christianity the
religion of the empire. There are 44,000,000
persons in Japan. Only 200,000 of them
profess Christianity, and of these a large
proportion are shaky in their orthodoxy,
from the point of view of the American
missionaries. One native out of ev
ery 220 calls himself a Christian.
The remaining 43,800,000 are divided
between Buddhism and cheerful ag
nosticism, which accords well with the
Oriental temperament. The news from
Tokio foreshadows an attempt to make
hÂ»o people Christians by imperial
proclamation. Persons interested in for
eign missions will be anxious to learn
whether the government will adopt the
dogmas of any particular Christian sect,
or whether it will permit people to con
struct their own state of religion from the
teachings of the Bible.

At the Worst, There Will Be a Ma

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 12.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: Republican ascendency In
thi next Senate is assured, even
though the Legislatures of California,
Delaware and Pennsylvania should ad
journ without electing United States
Senators.
If the Legislatures in all the States
which had Senatorial vacancies this
year had elected Senators of the same
politics as the State Legislatures on
joint ballot the next 'Senate would
have stood 55 Republicans. 26 Demo
crats, 3 Populists, 4 Silver Republicans
and Silverites and 1 Independent.
This would have given the Republi
cans a majority of 22 over the com
bined opposition. The Utah Legisla
ture, which is Democratic, has al
ready adjourned without electing a
Senator, thus cutting down the num
ber of Democrats to 25. The Legisla
tures of California. Delaware and
Pennsylvania are Republican, and if
they should all fail to elect Senators
the Republican membership would be
cut down to 53. At the same time,
however, the total membership of the
Senate would be reduced to 86 by
reason of the four vacancies that
would exist, and the Republicans
would still have a majority of 20 over
the combined opposition.
Further than this, Senator Kyle,
who was elected as an Independent,
can always be depended upon to vote
with the Republicans on the financial
questions. It will be seen, therefore,
that not only have the Republicans an
overwhelming majority on party lines,
but they will be able to command
enough support from outside of their
party on almost any question that may
come up to enable them to disregard
any loss of votes that might occur on
their own side, such as the probable
opposition of Senators Hoar and
Hale on colonial questions, and
possibly the opposition of Senator
Chandler and some of the men from
the mountain States on the financial
question. Should the Republicans In
the Legislatures of California. Dela
ware and Pennsylvania succeed in get
ting together and in electing a Repub
lican from each State, the Republicans
would have a clear majority of 23 over
all opposition.

LONDON, March 12.â There have been
few stranger stories than that of Lord
Sefton, eldest son of Lady Sefton, who
died recently. Before his succes
sion he was thrown from his horse
while hunting and it was thought that
he was dead. He was brought back to
life, but devoid of strength, memory and
reason. For years he has been helpless
and hopeless, but now a sudden
complete transformation has come. Lord
Sefton is rapidly recovering and soon will
be in perfect health. At the time of his
accident Lord Sefton was engaged to
Lady Mary Willoughby, th- lovely young
daughter of the Earl and Countess of
Ancaster. Lady Mary has not married
and society whispers a revival of the en

TWO ATLANTIC
STEAMERS MEET
WITH DISASTER
Big Allan Liner Castilian
Goes Ashore During a
Dense Fog.
The Oswetria, Bound for Man
chester, Stranded in Dunlough
Bay and Is a Total Wreck,
Special Dispat ch to The Call.
HALIFAX, N. S., March 12.â The new
Allan line steamship Castilian, from
Portland, Me., for Halifax, went ashore
at Gannet Rock light, near Yarmouth,
this morning at low tide in a dense fog,
her compass being deranged.
The steamship began leaking imme
diately after she struck, but the best
discipline prevailed among the passen
gers. They returned to their berths
and were called out again to don life
preservers, which many were wearing j
when they reached Yarmouth on tugs
at 8:15 o'clock this evening. The pas- j
sengera and the crew all saved their I
baggage. The steamship went on at
low tide, which will be in her favor.
The place of the disaster is a few miles .
from where tie Moravia of the Allan j
line was lost some years ago.
The Castiilan arrived at Halifax
from Liverpool ten days ago on her
maiden voyage and went to Portland
to load cargo for return, one is 8200 tons
net register, being the largest Allan
line steamer afloat. The ship is in
charge of Captain Barrett and officers
formerly of the steamer Parisian, the
entire crew of the Parisian having
been transfered to the new boat. The
steamer was due to embark mails and
passengers here for Liverpool.
The first and second holds are full of
water. The steamer is aground aft to
the engine room and there is six feet
of water in the engine room. There
is six fathoms of water under her aft.
The captain, three mates, the steward,
engineers and some of the crew remain
on board and three tugs are standing
by. The steamer was fifteen miles out
of her course, with a fresh southwest
wind which would increase the cur
rent The weather has remained mod
erate all day, but if the wind changes
there is no hope of the steamer
ever coming off. There is a fair pros
pect of salvage of the cargo.
The Allan's agent at Halifax has
chartered the steamers Delta and City
of Ghent to go to the scene of the
wreck to-morro%v. The use of the Gov
ernment lighthouse steamer, Aberdeen,
has also been applied for. The passen
gers and crew will leave Yarmouth to
morrow morning to take the mail
steamer Vancouver for England. They
speak in the highe.. terms of the dis- j
cipline maintained after the shiD
struck. She had been moving slowly,
with a sharp outlook In the haze. The
officers wanted to give a wide berth to
Cape Sable, which they feared they j
might be nearing. Nothing of whistle I
or buoy was heard or seen and no sign â 
of land until the shock, which was so
light that many passengers thought it
was a heavy wave.
The engines were reversed, but when
it was found the steamer held fast the !
boats were got ready and the sleeping
passengers awakened and told to pack
up in case it should be necessary to
send them ashore.
Splendid coolness was displayed by
the whole crew. Rockets were fired at
intervals, and at daylight the first of
ficer and purser went ashore in a small
boat to Tusket. They drove nine miles
to Yarmouth for assistance. During
this time the passengers were waiting
for help. The sea began to run high,
and the rolling of the ship became un
pleasant. Lord Archibald Douglas, a
returning Jesuit missionary, conducted
an impressive service on the deck in the
forenoon.
In the afternoon " c boats were
launched and the passengers and crew
taken off in them. Shortly after the :
whistles of the tugs were heard and ]
at 5 o'clock all hands but the captain. !
engineers and some of " c crew were
safely taken off and conveyed to Yar
mouth.
Opinions in Yarmouth differ as to
floating the ship. The el. nces are fa
vorable if the weather continues mod
erate. The work of discharging: the
carfro commences to-morrow. A large
number or sheep in the forward holds
have been found drowned, and the
swelling of grain Ha- thrown ud the
dining saloon deck.

PAVONIA PASSED THROUGH
A TERRIBLE ORDEAL
LIVERPOOL, March 12.â The officers
of the Cunard line steamer Pavonia.
Captain Atkins, from Liverpool Janu
ary 24 for Boston, which was towed
into St. Michaels on February 1 dis
abled, which arrived here yesterday
morning in tow of two tugs from Pun
ta Dflgado, Azores, maintain the ut
most reticence regarding the steamer's
experiences.
It was gleaned from the crew, how
ever, that the Pavonia passed through
a terrible ordeal. Her troubles began
with a terrible gale on January 3d.
For three days the engines were slowed
and mountainous seas tossed the Pavo
nia like a shuttlecock.
Then her boilers began to move in
their cradles and to bump against each
other. Eventually the engineers, after
the most arduous labor, secured the
boilers with ropes and chains and the
bumping ceased, but it was found that
the steam pipes were broken.
The crew assert that the vessel rolled
so tremendously that it would have
been impossible sometimes to walk on
her inner sides. Three boats were lost,
part of the port rail and the galley
were carried away and the bakehouse
was stove in. As the Pavania lies at
the dock she presents a pitiable dam
aged condition.

LOS AXGELES, March 12.â N0
more ideal Sabbath day, with
wealth of sunshine and clearness
of sky, ever dawned upon the
City of the Angels. The much
heralded statements that the ministers
of all denominations would devote their
sermons and prayers ta the question
why rain has not been vouchsafed the

served to till the places of worship to

"If God will quicken the hearts of
men so readily and permit drops of
heavenly grace to fall upon mankind
we have accomplished much," said a
leading divine, as he grasped the hand
of a prominent citizen who is celebrated
for acquiring shekels and equally
known as a non-communicant.
Should the earnest prayers that were
sent heavenward beseeching the throne
of grace to relieve the drought conditions
be answered in a ratio to their intensity
and fervor the parched soil would smile
in an eternal garb o-f verdure.
Rev. Mr. Taylor of St. John's Church
took for his text "The Lord hath con
troversy with his people." It had been
a disputed question, said he, whether
God had control of natural forces or
laws, and whether he could if he de
sired check earthquakes, volcanoes,
tidal waves <>r cyclones. He had per
fect control over them, declared the
divine, and they were sent as punish
ment >-r warning for our transgressions.
Nations and cities that had been de
stroyed had been most wicked ones.
Here in our own country injustice was
dealt out in courts of justice, murder
runs red-handed in the streets. We
ask: Is rain withheld from us for this
reason? Would it be sent if we were
brought to a proper state of repent
ance? There is much need of grace,
hence the earnest prayers and extra
days of devotion for pleading to God
for merciful forgiveness of our sins and
for the bestowal of the much-needed
rain.

General Corbin's declination is probably
unique in army history, as it is extrf-mely
doubtful If any officer ever offered an ap

Rev. Mr. Welsh of the Swedenborgian
Church said: "The distance of the Lord
Is what we make it by our disobedience
of heart. To receive blessings we must
Rain on the Just and the Unjust."
Rev. Mr. Knickerbocker of Trinity
Church had for his text "He Sendeth
Rain on the Just and the Unjust."
"There is no prior reason," he said,
"against invading the physical realm in
our prayers. God is able to answer.
He hangs answers to prayers as ripe
fruit on a stem of intelligence and in
dustry. If we are able by a new process
for invading a hitherto locked reservoir
to supply our need for rain, God will
not send it in answer to prayer. After
man has exhausted ail resources does
God exercise his power."
Rev. Mr. Mason's text was: "Fear
not, I am with thee." He said:
"Waves may roll mountain high; a
little bark may be sinking and every
one on board about to perish, but one
heart cry, "Lord, save me!' and the res

Rev. Mr. Smither of the First Chris

"Jesus' compassion for our race was
the great propelling force that brought
him into the world of sin and sorrow
and shame." said the minister. "Under
his magic touch the blindness of sin
turned into the eyesight of truth, rags
of disobedience into garments of right- j

the desert places of earth were made to
blospnm as the rose and shed forth the
fragrance of divine love. By this means
was the gospel perpetuated, and all

THE PESSIMISTS
Answer of Science to
Despair.
rHE REALITIES OF LIFE
LOVE AND ACTION ANTIDOTES
FOR ENNUI.
Stanford's President Preaches on
Fitzgerald's Version of the
"Hubaiyat" of Omar
Khayyam.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March
12. â President Jordan preached to the
students in the chapel this morning on
"The Philosophy of Despair." His
text was taken from FltzgeraJd's ver
sion of the "Rubalyat" of Omar Khay
yam. The purpose of the address was
to indicate some part of the answer of
science to despair. Said he:
Don't reply. Science has none for
the human wisdom. The ultimate truths
of the universe are no nearer than to the
child. Science knows no ultimate truths.
These are beyond the reach' of man, and
all that man knows must be stated in
terms of his experience. But as to
human experience and conduct, science
has a word to say.
Deeper and more worthy of respect Is
the sadness of science. The effort to see
things as they really are, to get out of
all make-believe and to secure that abso
lute veracity of thought without which
sound action is impossible, does not al
ways lead to hopefulness.
There is much to discourage in human
history, in the facts of human life. The I
common man, after all the ages, is still '
very common. He is ignorant, reckless, j
unjust, selfish, easily misled. All public
affairs bear the sham of his weakness.
Especially is this shown in the prevalence
of war. The boasted progress of civili
zation is dissolved in the 'barbarism of
war. Whether glory of conquest or com
mercial greed be war's purpose, the ulti
mate result of war is death. Its essen- j
tial feature is the slaughter of the young, i
the brave, the ambitious, hopeful," leav
ing the weak, the sickly, the discouraged,
to perpetuate the race. Thus all militant
nations become decadent ones. Thus the
glory of Rome, her conquests and her
splendor of achievements left the Ro- j
mans at home a nation of cowards and
such they are to this day, for those who
survive are not the sons of the heroes,
but of those whom the needs of two thou- !
sands years of warfare could not use.
That there seems no way out of this is j
the cause of the boundless despair of the |
thinking men of Continental Europe. A
chance shot may bring down the tremend
ous engines of war and in the streets of j
any city may be enacted the scenes of j
Paris or Sedan.
Dr. Jordan then took issue with the
pessimists who declare that the only
reality in life is pain. This he held
was not the real truth, for he who
knew no reality save appetite had
never known life at all.
'"The realities of life," he said, "are
love and action â not the desire but the
exercise of our appointed functions."
He continued:
Man's sensations and power to act must
Igo together. Man can know nothing that
I he cannot somehow, weave into action.
; If he fails to do this iii one form or an
] other it â  is through limitations he has
placed on himself. To weave knowledge !
into action is the antidote for ennui. To
plan, to hope, to do, to accomplish the j
full measure of one's power, whatso
ever they may be. is to turn away from
Nirvana to real life. A useful man. a help
ful man. an active man in every sense, j
even though his activity ia misdirected or
harmful, is always a hopeful man.
Optimism in life is a good working hy
pothesis if blindness and self satisfac
tion be not its mainspring. What if there
are so many of us in the ranks of hu
manityâthat the individual be lost in the
i mass as a pebble cast into the seven seas?
I Would you choose a world so small as to
leave room for only you and your satel
lites? Would you ask for problems of
life so tame that even you could grasp
them?
It is to us a question not of hope or de
spair, but of truth; not of optimism nor
! Â».f pessimism, but of wisdom. Wisdom
lis knowing what to do next; virtue is
doing it: religion, the heart impulse that
turns us toward the best and highest.

personal matters says:
As I think I stated in my letter to Mr.
Flower, I am in favor of the initiative

to our conditions, and assisted in the
adoption of such a plank In our State
convention, but I believe an attempt to
give that such prominence as you seem to
give it, means harm rather than advan
tage to the other reforms upon which tie
people are ready to act. I may be mis
taken, but such is my opinion. In your
letter you add the subject of Government
ownership of railroads, although â¢â¢our
circular does not mention this.
Your are in error in supposing that I
have advocated the Government owner
ship of railroads. I have been so ausily
engaged in the study and discussion of
the questions which have been imme
diately before me, that I have never had
opportunity to examine into the effect
of the Government ownership of railroads
in other countries. Even this has forcfd
certain issues into the foreground and
the people are ready to act upon triem.
To invite them to pass over these ques
tions and take up new ones will be con
fession that we were wrong last fall aiid

the reign of plutocracy inaugurated by

EXCURSION MARRED
BY A SAD ACCIDENT
Young Sacramentan Drowned While
on an Outing With a Party
of Foresters.
SACRAMENTO, March 12.â Last night
a large number of members of the Order
of Foresters went down the Sacramento
River by boat to Walnut Grove to assist
in instituting a new lodge there. Among
the Jnumber was Gottlieb Schmitt. a well
known young Sacramentan. The steamer
was moored alongside the bank and a
gangplank afforded means for the excur
sionists to debark. The ceremony of in
stituting the new lodge was gone through
with in the town hall, and then the large
assemblage sat down to a banquet.
The feast had not proceeded far when
the cry, "Man overboard!" was heard
coming from the direction of the river.
A hurried glance down the tables dis
closed the absence of Schmttt. The ban
queters, filled with forebodings, ran to
the steamer and found all In commotion
there. A man's hat had been discovered
on the edge of the boat outside the guard
rait and near the gangplank. Somebody
had heard a splash and a despairing ap
peal for help. Tho hat was examined by
the visiting Foresters and recognized as
thnt of Schmitt. Search was "made for
the missing man. but without avail, and
this morning the excursionists returned
to the city, convinced that their brother
member lay at the bottom of the river.
Younpr Schmitt was never known to
t;istr liquor, and he certainly had drank
nothing on the trip down the river. How
ho came to fall overboard is a mystery.
The theory of suicide is not seriously en
tertained, since so far as known the young
man had no troubles which should lead
him to take his life. While the banquet
was in progress a salute from a small
cannon was sent off at intervals, and it
is thought by Home that Schmitt was on
the gangplank when the first of these re
ports occurred, and that, startled by tho
sudden noise, he lost his balance and fell
into the water.
Schmitt was employed at the candy fac
tory of W. F. Peterson and was unmar
ried. Men dragged the river bed in the
vicinity of the drowning all of to-day
without recovering the body.

Success of Americans on the Sea HaÃ
Attracted World-Wide At
tention to Our
Ships.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, March 12.âLieuten
ant de Faramond of the French navy
recently arrived here in company with
the French Embassador, M. Cabon,
to become naval attache of the French
embassy. Lieutenant de Faramond
has had much experience as a naval
observer, following the Japanese and
Chinese vessels through the China-
Japan war, and now coming here to
study American naval methods. Speak
ing of the American navy to-day Lieu
tenant de Faramond said:
"The American navy has attracted
worldwide attention within the last
year, and this is leading European
countries to send naval attaches to
Washington. This will be the first time
the French Government has had a na
val attache with the embassy. A Ger
man naval officer is coming to the Ger
man embassy, and other countries will
doubtless fallow their example. Dur
inr the Spanish-American war this
country afforded splendid opportunities
for naval study. It was the first real
test of modern fighting vessels, and na
val science must draw its conclusions
largely from what the American navy
accomplished during the war with
Spain. I think it is universally con
ceded in Europe that the American
navy has a splendid record, not only
in a general way, but in technical mat
ters of naval detail. It demonstrated
the effectiveness of the rapid fire gun
of medium caliber rather than the
larger guns. It also seemed to show
that the power of a navy is more in
its weapons of attack and offense, its
capability of giving blows, rather than
in its heavy armor and capability of
resisting blows.
"We in Fiance were quite aware of
the growing power of the American
navy even bef- m the recent war. Our
chief naval constructor, M. Bertin.
came to this country prior to the war
and made a tour of your dockyards,
arsenals, etc. On his return he made
an official report, c' iwine the great
improvements the American naval
constructors had brought about, par
ticularly in the arrangement of bulk
heads and in the distribution of armor
so as to protect vital points. We also
know your American armor, and are
using the Harveyized American process,
which has been found entirely satisfac
tory thus far.
Lieutenant de Faramond says foreign
naval observers are not only interested
in the results of the war, but are also
observing the large amount of naval
construction now in progress in the
United States, and the naval improve
ment it involves. From Italian naval
statistics he shows that the United
States was to-day reckoned second
among the greal powers in point of
warships under construction. The ton
nage by countries is as follows: Great
Britain, 153.132 tons; United States, 56.
--425 tons; Japan, 47,510; Russia. 29,040;
France, 25,668; Germany, 16,545; Italy,
2972.
"An interesting line of inquiry," said
Lieutenant de Faramond, "is as to why
you are building so many heavy ships,
ironclads as we call them, as against
the lighter, swifter cruisers. The iron
clad is essentially a home ship, and is
not fitted, owing to her bulk and lack
of coal capacity, for crossing the ocean,
or for long cruises. The French navy
has in commission fifteen ironclads on
the Mediterranean and eight in the
Northern squadron: but those are
purely defense vessels and never leave
the home ports. The performance of
your battleship Oregon in running
13,000 miles around South America was
remarkable for that reason, and her
present trip across the Pacific is equal
ly remarkable. But, judged by the
usual naval standards, an armored
cruiser would have been much better
equipped for these long voyages. She
has the speed, the coal, and at the
same time sufficient armor to make her
defensive powers almoi equal to those
of the ironclad."
The lieutenant says France has gone
farther in adopting the torpedo boat
as an effective naval weapon than any
other country. She has in all some
250 torpedo boats, some of them very
swift.
Lieutenant de Faramond says he
thinks the adoption of the water tube
boilers in American warships will be a
further improvement and will make
them much more effective for lone:
cruising. This class of boilers, he says,
has been adopted by the British ad
miralty for the Powerful, the Terrible
and ships of that class, and quite gen
erally by the naval authorities of
France, Asia. Japan, Chile. Argentine
and Italy. M. Viaud, a naval con
structor of the French navy, is at pres
ent 1n Washington on an unofficial mis
sion and will confer with our naval
constructors on this new method of
boiler construction.
"Admiral Dewey is generally recog
nized abroad as entitled to rank as one
of the great naval commanders."
said Lieutenant de Faramond. "Such
a man does honor to the naval frater
nity the world over."
MASKED MEl\f R AID A
SACRAMENTO SALOON
SACRAMENTO, March 12. â Two
masked men entered the barroom of the
Sacramento Brewery, at Twenty-eighth
and M streets, at 11 o'clock to-ni^ht and
robbed the bartender and hal a dozen
patrons of the place. Both robbers were
masked with handkerchiefs tied over the
lower portions of their faces. One en
tered the room by the rear door and the
other by way of the front entrance. Both
presented revolvers and demanded that
every person in the room hold un his
hands. The demand was complied with
without loss of timp. The robbers ' then
emptied the till behind the bar and forced
the men to give, up their money and val
uables.
One of the men resisted and was beaten
into submission by one of the robbers,
who used his revolver as a club. In all
the robbers obtained $25 and three
watches. The -ollce have no clew to
their identity, but officers are searching

CONTROVERSY AS
TO THE CANAL
Denial of Statements of
Cannon.
SENATOR FRYE'S EXPLANATION
UNCLE CAM WOULD NOT HAVE
SQUANDERED MILLIONS.
There Was No Intention to Purchase
Worthless Concessions, and the
Matter Was Left to the
President's Discretion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 12.â Some of
the members of the Senate now in the
city take exception to the statement of j
Representative Cannon published Sat
urday concerning the defeat of the
recommendations of the President in
regard to the Nicaragua canal. The
statement to which the Senators make
particular objection is the following
one:
If the Senate bill or any measure pro
posed had been enacted the United States^
would have paid $5,000,000 for a worthlcss<
concession and would have been com
mitted by law to the construction of a
canal along the Nicaragua route, and un
der such conditions it would have been
compelled, before a spadeful of earth was
turned or actual construction begun, to
have acquired by treaty from Nicaragua
and Costa Rica the territory whereon to
construct a canal and the right to con
struct it. Such legislation would have
delayed and embarrassed construction of
an isthmian canal.
Referring to this statement to-night.
Senator Frye, chairman of the commit
tee in the Senate which inserted the
Nicaragua canal amendment in the
river and harbor bill, said:
The statement of Mr. Cannon to the ef
fect that the United States would have
paid $5,000,000 for a worthless concession if ;
either the Senate canal bill or any meas- I
ure proposed had been enacted, is incor- I
rect. The Senate canal bill provided for
the appointment by the President of ap
pralsers to value any property purchased
and the amount to be paid for any such j
property was limited to $5,000,000. If it j
were assumed that the appraisers would
pay $5,000,000 for some worthless thing j
and the President would have approved j
such action, then Mr. Cannon's statement
might be correct. But Mr. Cannon, nor
any one else, assumes that such a thing
would have been possible. Now, as to
the canal amendment Inserted .in the
river and harbor bill, not a word was said
about the payment of $5,000,000 for any |
purpose. That amendment authorized j
the President for and in behalf of the
United States to acquire such portion of
territory now belonging to Costa Rica j
and Nicaragua or such rights, easements, ,
or privileges therein, or connected there-
With, as may be necessary to excavate, i
construct, control and defend a canal, and
so on. There is nothing in that provision
requiring the payment of $5,000,000 or 5
cents Nor Is there anything in that (
provision requiring that any treaty be |
negotiated with Nicaragua and <-Osta
Rica to secure territory. The President
was authorized to acquire it. if he could.
and the money was appropriated to pay
for it Ido not, and did not, interpret j
that amendment as authorizing the Presi
dent to acquire tne concession of property
of any corporation, as I do not believe
such concessions are worth anything.
But if it did authorize him to do so, it is
not true that the United States would
have paid $5,000,000 for a worthless conces
sion unless we are to assume that the
President of the United States would be a
party to it. Ido not think anybody will
assume that. Now. the only other pro
posed measure was the House bill, or the
one reported to the House by Mr. Hep
burn. That bill did not authorize the
payment of a cent lor any concession held
by any corporation. Hence, Ido not see
what could have misled Mr. Cannon
into making such a statement unless it
' was the fact that not being a member
I of any of the committee having this mat
ter in charge, he was misled.
I see that in another part of his state
ment he says that "the United States
cannot afford to enter upon this great
work until it has acquired by a treaty a
zone of territory whereon to construct
the canal." Holding that view, I do not
see how he could object, as he does in
another part of his statement, to
I measures which he says would have com
pelled the United States, before any work
could be done on the canal, to "have ac
quired by treaty from Nicaragua and
j Costa Rica the territory whereon to con
struct a canal and the right to construct
it." The fact is that a good deal was left
In the Senate bill and in the Sonata
amendments to the river and harbor bill,
as far as this subject is concerned, to
the discretion of the President. Nothing
could be done excepting with his ap
proval, and he was not required to pay
out anything, but was merely authorized
to do it. Neither did the Senate amend
ment to the river and harbor bill commit
the President to the Nicaragua route.
The Spooner amendment, which was
adopted, specifically provides that if the
President was unable to make satisfac
tory arrangements over the Nicaragua
route he could negotiate for control of or
right to construct "some other canal con
necting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans."
xYsked what action he thought the
President would take under the pro
vision finally made by Congress, Sena
tor Frye replied:
I think that he will add two members to
the Walker commission, and that he will
direct them to proceed at once to Pan
ama and inspect the canal there and re
port on that route. By tho time that is
done the Walker commission will have
been able to complete its report in regard
to the Nicaragua route. In my opinion
that report will give everything needed
in the way of information as to the Nic
aragua route, and there will be no neces
sity for acquiring any more Information
concerning that route.
WAS CHIEF OF A
GREAT COPPER RING
Death of M. Secretan Whose Opera
tions in 1888 Caused a Panic
in Paris.
PARIS, March 12. âM. Socretan,
founder of the Societe dcs Metaux
and chief agent in the great copper
ring of 1888, died to-day.
The late M. Secretan, in February.
1888, formed a French syndicate to raise
the price of copper, then very low, by
a monopoly. The syndicate had every
thing its own way until March of the
; following year, when it came to grief
' through M. Secretan's wild specula
tions in copper, its collapse being fol
lowed by a widespread panic. M. Sec
, retan's tapestries, china and articles of
vertu, with some of his pictures, were
; sold at public auction, realizing enor
; mous prices. Shortly after several plc
j tures were taken to London, where they
I were so-ld by Messrs. Christie for nearly
Â£30,000. He contrived, however, to
save enough from the wreck to live
comfortably.

CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA- I
MENTO, March 12.â The statement that
the administration at Washington will
not interfere in the contest for United
States Senator now in progress here is t
again corroborated. To-night Genera!
Barnes received a letter from Judge
Waymire in which the latter writes un- J
der date of Modesto, March 12, as fol- I
lows:
"I have a letter from Mr. Hanna, in
Which he expresses great anxiety to
have a Senator elected. Says he has
not taken sides with any one."
3t is known that the "organization"
made an effort to get from Washington j
an expression of some kind favorable to |
the aspirations of D. M. Burns, and it is j
now clear that the attemnt was unsue- j
cessful. The duty of electing a Senator i
will, be performed by the Republican |
majority in the Legislature. The signs
to-night indicate that the deadlock will I
be broken. Colonel J. P. Jackson, Cdl
* lector of the Port of San Francisco,
â went home to-day but will return to
this place to-morrow evening. Senator !
Currier of Los Angeles, who has been j
absent from the Senate for three weeks
or more, returned to-night and will cant
his vote for United States Senator on
the joint ballots to-morrow. It is said
here to-night that he will vote for Gen- i
eral Barnes.
Assemblyman Huber went south day ]
before yesterday. He will probably re- j
turn to-morrow or next day. Assembly
man Le Barron may leave Sacramento
for his home in Sonoma County next
Wednesday evening. His mind is not
tuily made up on this point, but he says j
that business affairs at home demand ,
his personal attention. He will return!
I here provided the session of the Legis
-1 lature is prolonged beyond the coming
â  week.
? All the whispered rumors regarding a
. close relationship between the camps of
Dan Burns and U. S. Grant are given
out for circulation by the chief touts of
the Burns corral. The purpose in view
is to brace up the weak and despondent
followers of the â¢Colonel." The Burns ;
forces are badly d>- .oralixed by the de- J
t of the Harbor Commission reor
ganization schenv- which followed close
on Burns' defeat on poolsellingproposi
ti'iDP.
Several of the supporters of the
"Colonel" began to show signs of de
serting the corral when they saw for
themselves that the boasts of control
ling legislation were empty assertions
of strength. Something had to be done
to brace up the column and keep the
men in line between Saturday night
and Monday morning. The old bluff
Of winning the Senatorship on a cer
tain' day or getting a caucus at a cer
tain time was played out several days
ago. The touts who were capable of
doing a little brain work on their own
account called to mind that Governor
Gage had not vetoed all the legislative
measures which emanated from â¢ the
Grant and Barnes supporters and
neither had he shown any preference I
for the bills emanating from the lead
ers in the Burns corral.
These facts, coupled with others of
equal significance, aroused the sus
picion that the promises of State
patronage, so freely made in the cor
ral, were "bricks." In order to stop a
breakaway a new confidence scheme t
had to be devised. Some one, perhaps
the adroit Lindley, fancied that it
â would be a deep game to spread
abroad the impression that an alliance
between Burns and Grant had been
established. The reports of negotia
tions between Grant and Burns are
utterly false and absurd. Burns can
not make any headway by compromise
or negotiation. He is simply facing an
impassable wall created by the force
and power of public judgment. With
the assistance of Democrats he may
be able to force an adjournment of the
Legislature before a choice for a Sen
ator is reached, but he cannot gain the
prize "himself or name the winner.
Should the Southern Pacific Railroad
refuse to sustain him in the effort to
prc-Vent the election of a Senator, his
chance of success in the scheme would
be very slender.
The fifty-eight members of the
Legislature who have resolved that
there shall be no caucus and that this
State shall not be disgraced by the
ejection of an unworthy man, repre
sent much of the integrity and ability
L of the Legislature. The superior de- |
* haters and the best parliamentary gen- |
erals are among them, they are here |
serving the public without hope of j
â¢" other reward than the commendation i
of the people, and they will stay until
the Legislature adjourns.
Red-eyed hunger has raised a pretty
row in the camp of the Mexican. Sixty
day? of unwonted affluence and ten
days of meager banqueting at Sacra
mento's none-too-beautlfu! lunch count
ers has left the San Francisco gang in a
Bfate of penury that is distressing. Not
one of- them but owes in San Francisco
th.- price of his election to this .session
of the Legislature. Many at them are
in debt for from a hundred to six hun
dred apiece, and those who have homes
; to have been reduced to the
necessity of remittances from that
Quarter for two weeks past. The truth
of th. matter is that then- has been not
a dollar's worth of "business" done, I
Since the gang came up here to vote for
"de Colonel," and no well regulated
"Polly" from the sunny side of Market I
pan exis-t t.irough a prolonged session,
on 1), r diem provided by {\v
State. That, however, is the rub. The
lark of cash might be taken under or
dinary cm umstances as a San Joaquin
..farmer takes a scant rainfall, as a mis
fortune, it i S the well grounded sus
picion th;.t the "stuff" has arrived and
not been doled out that has raised the
rumpus, and it has raised it to the ex- j
tent that yesterday two of the most
prominent members of the metropolitan
delegation called on Burns and on be
half of the crowd delivered its ulti
fiatunx Something must "be doing"
efore adjournment, and the leaders
have got at least to mako a divy of
what is coining into the corral.
The fender bill ran its weary lenerth
through both houses and left no golden
! trail behind it. The harbor bill left the
i same unhallowed memory. Then the
nickle-in-the-slot cinch was punctuated
with no dollar marks, and the gang be
i pan to ask questions. They had seen
' their leaders doing the line with wads
i of long green that would make the eyes
iof a veteran of '91 bulge. They have
i seen the major regaling self and "Jake"
; on French dinners that conjured memo
! ries of happier and more prolific days,
I and have wondered where the price was
j coming from. They carried no sacks.
' and ate no dinners and the most log
ical conclusion possible from the gang
; was that the â¢stuff" was on hand and
i in plenty, but that it was getting no
i farther than headquarters.
Then came the Santa Fe bill. Two
I days before that measure came up .on
I its final passage the gang "hollered
| murder," as it was expressed by a
I prominent member. "No stuff, no vote,"
! was the ultimatum, and fo-r forty-ejght
I hours matters looked serious for the
i bill in the Assembly. An hour before
j it was called up, however, word came
! from headquarters to stand in. The
whip was laid on and had a salutary
effect, and the gang had nothing to
do but throw up its hand and shr,-ut
"aye" when its turn came. Since then
rebellion has been almost open. The
gang cannot be convinced that dollars
I in large numbers were not used in get
ting the measure .through, and they
' insist that the two leaders on the floor
I who engineered matters hogged the
j whole sack. They look at it as a cold
j blooded business proposition and figure
i that they have been bunkoed out of
I their due profit by false pretenses.
It was this that caused the visit of
yesterday to- the colonel. Those who
represented the gang told without em
bellishment ' their tale of woe and in
| formed Burns that while he need not
j fear defection from the ranks it would
! be well for him to remember that the
I crowd would not stand everything, and
that his lieutenants must be instructed
to do the fair thing and give them a
chance to make enough at least to pay
off those pre-election obligations. The
prospect of going back home next week
with empty pockets and nothing but
overdue nc-tes to face is not pleasing
and the week must bring forth profit.
Senator Currier of Los Angeles, who
arrived from the south thi^ evening,.
went at once to his apartments on L
street and gave directir.-ns to deny ad
mission to callers, as he required rest.
While his health is not fully restored
he expects to be able to attend the joint
Assembly to-morrow. His most inti
mate friends say that he will vote for
General Barnes.
Milton Green to-night telephoned to
the Grant people that he would be here
to-morrow forenoon. He expected to
leave Oakland this evening, but his
wife's physicians advised him to remain
at home until Monday morning.
MANY HEARTS TO BE

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March 12.â 1t is expected that
during the present week Governor Gage
will make a number of appointments and
thus make happy many Republicans who
have been slated for several of the places
within the gift of the Chief Executive
since the beginning of the year. It is
necessary that some of the appointments
to be made by the Governor shall be con
firmed by the Senate. Appointments of
this class are the ones that will be an
nounced during the present week that
they may be acted on by the Senate be
fore adjournment of the Legislature.
There are several candidates in the field
for the position of State Labor Commis
sioner. One of these is Lou Martin, ser
geant at arms of the Senate. Martin is
well liked and highly esteemed by men of
all shades of political belief and during
his incumbency of his present position he
has g-ained a host of friends. Contrary
to the general rule in such cases, Martin's
candidacy for the position of Labor Com
missioner is a popular one.

tee held a session to-day anil figured on
appropriations for public institutions, but
there was no material change made in the

they should be given as much as the bill
allows ihem, but it is not expected that
many changes will be made in the Hems.
The "committee will consider the bill to

STAND OF THE PRESIDENT
APPEARED ANXIOUS TO CON
TINUE WAR WITH SPAIN.
It Is Explained, However, That Mc-
Kinley and Day Displayed the
Correct Diplomatic
Attitude.
Special Dispatch to The Call!
NEW YORK, March 12.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent sends
the following: Administration officials
are very much gratified at the ability
and tact displayed by Embassador
Jules Cambon in representing Spain
during: the peace negotiations last sum
mer, as shown by the correspondence
made public in the Spanish red -book
and printed in the Herald this morning.
Embassador Cambon's letter, in
which he says the President and Sec
retary Day seemed to be disappointed
when Spain accepted the terms at
peace, and that it seemed to be appar
ent that they thought Spain would re
ject the terms and afford a greater ex
cuse for forcing the war to an end, will
probably be made much of by political
opponents of the administration. It
will be seized upon by Democrats as an
evidence that the President wanted ta
continue the war for the mere sake
of fighting, and that he wanted to still
further humiliate an already defeated
nation.
Both the President and Mr. Day will
be charged with being jingoes of the
most extreme type, who were not satis
fied with obtaining a relinquishment of
Spanish sovereignty in Cuba, the ces
sion of Porto Rico and Guam and the
submission of the sovereignty of the
Philippines to the peace commission,
but wished to carry the war to the ex
tent of depriving Spain of all. her colo
nies, and perhaps even to the extent of
bombarding the seacoast cities on the
Spanish peninsula.
In opposition to this argument it can
be urged that as M. Boefve, chancellor
of the French embassy, explains, the
disappointment of the President was
not because Spain had accepted, but
MEXICAN DAKi "800 HOO! THEY WON'T LET ME HAVE A CAUCUS."
because she had failed to make an un
conditional acceptance. It can also be
asserted that if the President and Mi-.
Day led the French Embassador to
think that they were anxious to con
tinue the war they took exactly the
j proper method to bring Spain to terms
without more delay.
Whatever may have been their mo
tive, it seems from the corespondence
printed in the red book that the Span
ish Government was impresse.d with
the entire willingness if not anxiety
of the President to continue the war
even to the extent of obliterating the
Spanish kingdom, and the result was
an immediate acceptance by the Span
ish Ministry of the terms offered by
the United States.
CHARGED WITH THE
MURDER OF HIS SON
Nick Bandini's Suicide Story Not
Believed by San Jose Offi
cials.
SAN JOSE, March 12.â Joe Bandlni, who
with his father, Nick Bandini, was a prin
cipal in a cutting and shooting affray last
night, is dead and the parent occupies a
cell in the city prison, accused of having
murdered his "son. Bandini Sr. denies the
charge, and says the boy committed sui
cide. All the circumstances are against
this theory. The old man is nearly wild
with anguish and has expressed a desire
to end his existence. He begs all who
come near to give him poison or a
weapon:
Young Bandini. who was 19 years of age,
died at the receiving hospital this morn
ing at 4 o'clock. The bullet had pene
trated the brain.
Chief of Police Kidward put Nick Ban
dini in the "sweatbox." District Attorney
Campbell was present and the man was
closely questioned through an interpre
ter. "Bandini said he and his son had
been engaged in irrigating "an orchard in
the Willows. After supper the boy left
his home. He started In search of him
and found him visiting Henry Tolesco on
Park avenue, a few blocks away. They
left there at 8:30 for their home on the
corner of San Salvador street and Bird
avenue. After they reached home the
boy declared his intention to go uptown.
The father objected and a quarrel result
ed. Young Bandini started to go and his
father grappled with him. The boy had
a knife in his hand eating a piece of cel
ery, and in the struggle the father was
badly cut in the hand and received a
slash in the neck. Bandini told his son
he had killed him and rushed Into another
part of the house to dress his wounds.
Young Bandini went out the back door
and a few minutes later the father heard
a pistol shot. He ran out and found the
boy lying on the steps with a bullet
wound in the top of his head. The pris
oner stated he was then about to kill
himself with remorse, but a son-in-law,
Innocencla Battalio, prevented the act.

OMAHA, March 12.â A Bee special
from Rapid City, S. D., says: The bliz
zard that swept over the country east
of this city last week was the worst
ever experienced here. Reports Just
coming in say at least two lives were
lost. The son of Shelby Reed, a large
sheep owner, who was out tending
sheep, is missing, and there Is little
doubt that he perished. A mail carrier
named Pearson is missing. Shelby's
horse came home rider-less during the
storm and the saddle has been found.
It Is feared others were caught in the
storm and have perished.
CHEYENNE, Wyo., March 12.â The
latest news received here from the
Cheyenne and Northern passenger
train, snowbound near Iron Mountain
for over two weeks, is that the train is
expected to arrive here about Tuesday.
The relief train sent from here on Fri
day has been unable to make much
headway against the snowdrifts. Al
though the provision supply of the Im
prisoned train is small, it is said there
is no danger of the passengers suffering
for the want of food. The farmers in
the vicinity are supplying them with
what they can spare from their limited
stock on hand.
DETROIT, Mich., March 12.â A spe
cial to the Tribune from Bessemer says:
I The heaviest storm in the history of
the snow belt is prevailing. For forty
eight hours all trains have been snowed
in at different places. Streets are block
ed by banks of snow from four to eight
feet deep. This, with former storms,
I will make the total fall of snow about
eight to twelve feet on an average. In
some places the drifts are from the top
of one roof to another. Telegraph wires
are down and all communications are
by private lines.
A special from Houghton says: A
howling blizzard for the past twenty
| four hours has tied up everything. All
! trains are canceled and no railroad
| communication with the East has been
had since Saturday. A double-header
I sent out this morning over the Mineral
Range struck a snow bank twelve feet
high one mile west of Haycock and a
gang of snow shovelers was dispatched
to shovel the engines out. Snow drifts
eight feet high are in the streets.
Calumet reports the streets complete
ly blocked and in places the drifts
cover the first story of some of the
business houses. Joseph Willmer, a
trammer, was found frozen to death to
day.
MILWAUKEE, March 12.âThrough
out the 'Wisconsin Valley districts the
snow is from one to four feet deep on
the level. Trains to-day were several
hours late. Many of the streams in
Eastern Wisconsin and Northern Wis
consin have overflowed, washing out
railway tracks in many nlaces.
OSHKOSH, Wis, March 12.â A heavy

GOMEZ GLAD
TO SHEATHE
HIS SWORD
Touching Manifesto as to
Removal From flrmy's
Con)n)and.
It Is Believed, However, That a
Majority of Cubans Will Uphold
Their Veteran Leader.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, March 12.â General Go
mez has issued the following state
ment to the Cuban people and army:
By the use of the supreme faculties
with which it is endowed, the Assembly,
representing the army only, has deposed
me as eommander-in-ehief of the Cuban
army, which grade it conferred upon me
during the last war. As eommander-in
chlef I always followed the dictates of
my best conscience and the call of great
national needs. I endeavored in all cir
cumstances to fulfill my duty.
The Assembly considers the fact that I
do not aid it in efforts to raise loans,
which later would compromise the great
est financial and political interests of
Cuba, to be an act of insubordination and
of want of respect. The primary cause
for the action taken against me is my
conviction that Cuba should begin the
exercise of its own sovereignty, as a re
public of union and concord, proclaimed
at Monte Cristo and sustained unimpaired
on the field of battle, free from all com
promise, keeping the nation's honor
spotless.
As for the rest, as a sincere man. I
confess I thank them because they re
lieve me of great political obligations and
also leave me free to return to my aban
doned home, which, during thirty years
of continual strife for the good of this
country that I love so much, has been
my one aspiration. Foreigner as I am,
I did not come to serve this country by
helping it to defend Its just cause as a
mercenary soldier, and consequently,
since the oppressive power of Spain has
withdrawn from this land and left Cuba
in freedom, I have sheathed my sword,
thinking I had finished' the mission I had
voluntarily imposed upon myself. I am
owed nothing. I retire contented and
satisfied at having done all I could for
the benefit of my broth-rs. Wherever
destiny rules that I maka my home,
there can the Cubans defend upon a
friend.
Governor General Brooke was noti
fied last night of the removal of Go
mez, and when seen this morning he
was much interested to learn the de
tails of the Assembly's proceedings. He
said he could not express an opinion
as to the effect of the Assembly's ac
tion upon the future relations between
General Gomez and the United States,
particularly In the matter of disburs
ing the $3,000,000 offert I by Washing
ton to the Cuban trr as a condition
of disbandment, but the impression
among the American authorities seems
to be that, as the Assembly has never
been officially recognized by the United.
States Government, its actions, so far
as "Washington is concerned, will not
amount to more than the resolutions of
any other body of individuals.
The Assembly is being strongly cen
sured by Cubans on all sides, and there
were popular demonstrations this aft
ernoon in favor of the deposed com
mander-in-chief, the crowds shouting
"Long live Gomez" and 'Death to the
Assembly." â
General Gomez during the day re
ceived numerous visitors, all of whom
assured him of their affection and loy
alty, and that the declaration by the
Assembly, on whatever subject, could
not represent even the army, as the
elections which gave its members their
present positions are really voidable
for Illegality and political jobbery.
There is no doubt that a majority of
the people surrnort him as against the
Assembly. The local press will prob
ably attack the Assembly, urging its
dissolution as the best tntng that can
happen and insisting that there is no
reason why the United States authori
ties may not continue to treat with
General Gomez in the matter of the
payment of the troops.
It is said an good authority that the
pay rolls Gomez is preparing to hand
General Brooke are most complete, full
and fair, and that when the army
learns he can aid the troops in- procur
ing $3,000,000, whereas it is problemat
ical whether the Assembly can obtain
anything, there is little doubt as to the
side the army will take in the contro
versy. The troops are tired of the field
and insufficient food and the indica
tions are that they would readily dis
band on receipt of the $3,000,000, unless
deceived by the Assembly with prom
ises of a larger payment in the event
of refusing to disband.
General Gomez enjo-ys the full confi
dence of the American military au
thorities and it is not believed thSt he
will leave Cuba at present.
The question of his successor as com
mander in chief has not yet been con
sidered, but General Mayia Rodriguez
is the next in command.
The patriotic clubs have decided to
abolish the Junta Patric-tica and to es
tablish a patriotic league in its place.
General Gomez. It is said, will be asked
to accept the presidency of the new or
ganization,
TREE OF LIBERTY IS
PLANTED AT SANTIAGO
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, March 12.â A
movement is on foot here to persuade
the Lfnlted States Government to pur
chase San Juan Hill, to be used as a
public park. The idea is that a certain
portion could be set apart to be used
as an American cemetery and the site
of a mortuary church. A few thousand
dollars spent upon the rest would make
a beautiful recreation ground, including
a half-mile racetrack, a baseball dia
mond and tennis ground. General
Wood, military Governor, and other
prominent Americans favor the pro
ject.
Senor Bacardi, Mayor of Santiago, to
day planted a tree of liberty in the
Plaza Dolores in the presence of more
than 3000 children, representing the dif
ferent schools of the city, as well as a
large concourse of citizens. He spoke
of the glorious deeds of Cuban patriots
during the last thirty years and of their
uphill struggle in the face of immense
odds. He paid a warm tribute to the
good work done by General Wood, and
glowingly prophesied regarding what
will be done "when the Cubans manage
their own country without assistance."
RIVERA GOES TO
CONFER WITH GOMEZ
PONCE, Porto Rico, March 12.â
Senor Munoz Rivera, former Secretary
of State in the insular Cabinet, left for
Havana yesterday by the steamer San
Ignacio, en route for the United States.
Before his departure he had a confer
ence with the colonial commission now
inquiring into questions relating to the
civil government of Porto Rico, to
which much importance is attached.
The commissioners declined to make
public the nature of the conference,
on the ground that it must be kept pri
vate for the prr nt.
Before leaving Havana for the United
States Senor Munoz Rivera will confer
with General Maximo Gomez. He was
the recipient of more than a hundred
telegrams and letters wishing htm suc
cess.
ALUMINUM POWER
LINE IS COMPLETED
The Blue Lakes Plant Is Now Ready
to Supply Stockton With
Electricity.
STOCKTON. March 12.â The pole line of
the Blue Lakes Power Plant is now com
pleted from Stockton to Mokelumne Hill
and has been given final inspection by the
best experts the company could engage.
It is expected that power equal to 5000
horsepower will be delivered here over
four wires within forty-five days. The
survey for the line to Oakland is going
forward rapidly. Great interest centers
in how the aluminum wires will work un- ,
der heavy voltage. If entirely success
ful, as the owners have every reason to
expect, the remainder of the great system
will be completed in the same manner.
If not, the company will have to fall back
on copper wire. The pole line is said to
be the finest ever erected in the West.
Encounters a Typhoon.
TACOMA, March 12.â The steamer
Victoria, arriving- to-day from China and
Japan, encountered a terrific typhoon of
four days' duration off the coast of
Japan. She. outrode the storm safely,
and has no word of other vessels being
damaged by it. The steamer brought 200
passengers, mostly Chinese and Japan
ese, and 1900 tons of freight across the
I'acitie. Thr> Asiatics were for Victoria
and this port. Included in the cargo are
300 bales of silks, valued at hundreds of
thousands of dollars. They go east by
the overland express to-night.

THE BUSINESS SITUATION.
ONE of the most gratifying signs of the times of
late is the general advance of wages in certain
industrial lines. The cotton workers, metal'
workers and coal miners are now receiving from 5 to
10 per cent more wages than a week ago. most of the
increase being at the higher figure. This tells .the
of industrial prosperity better than anything
else. Another good sign 19 the marked activity of the
New York dry goods market, which .is reported
booming to such an extent that most lines of cottons
silks are away behind in their orders owing to the
oversold condition of the mills. As for the iron and j
steel trade, it is still characterized by a feverish de
mand, insufficient supplies, further advances in quota-
tions and an increase in the number of old furnaces
being fitted up tor operation. This trade has made
gigantic strides during the past year or two and now
kpds the world. Lumber, too. continues in fine con
dition, the demand is active in most localities and
prices are firm on account of the well-cleaned-up con
n of the market. The state of trade in general
throughout the country is shown by the increase of
49.5 per cent in the weekly bank clearings over the
same week in 1898. and the decline in the number of
failure? from 248 in 1898 to 182 in- 1899. The leading
markets, East and West, report an active spring trade.
ally in dry goods, boots and shoes and clothing.
Though business in Wall street fell off somewhat
there was a stronger tone, though it was; generally
ascribed to bullish manipulation. The only unfavor
able feature- of the week was the continued demor
alization of the wool market, which is still hampered
by immense stocks all over the country. Wheat was
weaker in spite of crop damage reports and a con
tinuation of the large export demand, as there was a
disposition to discount the expected Government rc
of large stocks still in the hands of the farmers
The leport has since been issued and it gives the
amount still in farmers' hands at 198.000,000 bu-i'ic's,
or about 29.2 per cent of last year's crop. This is not
a bad showing, however, as we have passed almost
three-quarters' of the crop year and have used up al
most three-quarters of the yield. The supplies of corn
are also normal and about what they generally are at
this time of the year. So there is nothing discour
aging in the statistical position of- the cereal market.
A striking feature of the week in this State was the
suspension of the county bank of San Luis Obispo,
not through any want of funds but because the di
rectors did not care to go through another dry season,
which seemed imminent. This action seems rather
premature to an outsider, as the same dispatch which
announced the closing of the bank stated that a rain
in a few days would set the county all right, and the
conditions of late have been rather in favor of rain
than against it. A procedure of this sort is apt to
have an unfavorable effect on business and should not
be taken until the apprehended condition has passed
from the mist of contingency into the broad daylight
of settled fact. There is time to cross a bridge when
it is reached. The State, except in a few southern and
centra 1 ! localities, is not suffering from lack of rain,
though it is uselejs to deny that it is needed almost
everywhere. Light rains, however, have been coming
id from the ocean of late, and if they continue we will
get fur ct ops all right.
Every few days a dispatch comes through from the
East informing us that business in California is stag-
l-int on account of dry weather. There is nothing
like going away from home to get the news. If there
n any stagnation in general trade in San Francisco
it has not yet reared its grisly head. Real estate is
dull, but i* has been so for several years. Merchan
dising, however, is going along just as usual, our local
brink clearings exhibit no commercial depression,
failures continue few and small, collections are up to
the average, and there is plenty of money in sight for
solvent borrowers at the established rates of interest.
The crops in the northern part of the State are all
right and the southern portion will make a fair show
ing with the usual spring showers.. Any expectation
of crop failure at the moment, therefore, is simply
discounting n shadowy future which we may never see.
One good rain will effectually lay the menacing
specter which has been scaring timid folk for some
weeks. In any event the crops of the State at large
look a hundred -per cent better than they did nt this
time last year, when we made a pretty fair showing,
nil things considered. Those who are in daily touch
-vith the mercantile element hear no serious com
plaints of dull trade nor many apprehensions as to the
future. And surely the merchants ought to know
how business stands.

THE FIELD OF BLOOD.
WITH voices of righteous indignation the pastors
of the city yesterday united in denouncing the
Inglcside gamblers and the far reaching evil
they maintain at the race course. With the fervor of
men who feel the responsibility resting upon them
as guardians of the moral welfare of the community,
they upheld the action of the Supervisors in taking
steps to put an end to the evil, and urged all good j
citizens t-o support the officials in the work of reform.
The pastors know how great has been the evil
wrought by the race course, with its hordes of pool- i
sellers tempting not only men but young boys and I
even women to enter upon the swift and sure, road j
to ruin. They have watched the dreary record in- ;
crease in the number of ruined lives, wrecked homes j
and disgraced families. They have therefore spoken I
upon the subject with the genuine eloquence of earn- i
est feeling. They stand forth as the champions of ;
the home as well as of the altar, and plead to the
strength of humanity to act in accord with divine law
and save weaker humanity 1 from the curse of the evil
which threatens it.
It was full time for the pastors of the city to speak
out. The issue is one of morality and falls clearly
within the scope of the duty to their profession and j
to their people. The Call is glad to welcome such
strong allies to the cause it has so much at hvart and
for which it has labored so long. It can commend
all they have said in their zeal for the right, because
! in its work of chronicling the daily occurrences of the
city it has had occasion to lay before its. readers a
terrible array of crimes ranging from embezzlement i
! to suicide resulting from the effects and the influ
ences of what one of the pastors so aptly called "the
| field of blood."
The Supervisors having now entered upon the work
of freeing the city of the fearful curse, should not turn
! back nor stay their hands until the task is fully ac
complished. The better portion of the press is with
them, the labor organizations are with them, the mer
chants are with them, mothers are with them and the
j clergy are with them. Indeed every force in the com
munity which makes for good is on their side.
Doubtless the gamblers of the track and their
patrons can rally a host sufficient in numbers and loud
enough in talk to seem strong. Doubtless they can
raise considerable sums of money and get cunning
advocates to fight for the continuance of the nefarious
trade which has proven so profitable to them. Such
strength as they can muster, however, is as nothing to
that which is against them. Business sagacity, which
desires to guard employes against temptation to dis
honesty, is in this instance united in sentiment with
the sacred affections of the home, which seeks the
preservation of family honor.
It is no slight issue that is presented to the Super
visors. The most vital interests of the people are at
stake. Hearts, homes and lives as well as money
are involved. San Francisco must be saved from the
menace and the curse of '"the. field of blood."
BURNS OND THE RAILROAD.
/""* ORPORATIONS, like men, usually work for !
( their own interests, and although it is frequently !
' thought that on account of their advantages they
i-.acquire too much power and too much influence,- they
! are not commonly abused because they are not phil
anthropists, but act upon selfish motives. In this
State, however, the group of corporations now epito
mized by the Southern Pacific Company seems to
have been possessed by an evil and a malicious spirit,
; which has inspired it to antagonize the people even
when the antagonism was unprofitable. Its contempt
for public opinion and its virulent love of power have i
been manifested to a degree that has caused amaze- j
ment at home and abroad. The Central Pacific Rail- |
road had hardly been completed through the munifi
cent endowment of the Federal Government, by the
State and by municipalities before the words "all the
traffic will bear" expressed its undeviating policy. Part
of the ordinary railroad business became the culti
vation, by the establishment of opposition towns, of
inimical relations with thriving communities in the
San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys. Wherever there ;
was a railroad station it was used as a custom house,
from w-hich a tariff, which discriminated between lo
calities and even between individuals and that was
frequently prohibitory, was enforced. The absence
or the suppression of competition for twenty-eight
years or thereabouts and the unrelenting greed and
selfishness of this singularly favored monopoly drew
I into its treasury a very large proportion of the net
l earnings of the State, and through its concentration
of purpose, its close relations with every form of busi
ness and of industry, the skilled intelligence it com-
I manded and its stern and unbending discipline, its
power over politics, society, legislation and, as many
believed, even the administration of the' law, grew to
be almost unlimited and intolerable.
This unnatural position, impossible except under
our isolated condition, was not obtained without
steady and uncompromising resistance, and in a grow
ing American commonwealth, reaching out in all di
rections for connections with the civilized and even
with the uncivilized world, it could not be permanent
ly held. The railroad was always opposed, not within
its legitimate sphere but in its aggressive cupidity
and in its insolent dogmatism, and sometimes it was
beaten. At last a point was reached where two facts
seemed to concur; first, that all practical questions be
tween the railroad and the people were settled and
closed, and, second, that its brand upon a political
organization insured defeat. Our citizens of any rec
ognized party are not sand-lotters nor proletarians.
They have no prejudice against the railroad, no wish
to confiscate its property nor to deprive it of just
compensation for services rendered, but an earnest
desire to protect its substantial interests and for the
permanent restoration of that harmony which would
never have been broken but for its unjust exactions
and its despotic methods. When the campaign of
1898 began it appeared that the time was ripe fdr the
complete assertion of conservative and yet progressive
Americanism through the Republican party, combin
ing in its support the best elements of our population,
and for the seizure and use of unexampled opportuni
ties, with a broad and acute comprehension of their
significance and with a united determination in this
eventful period to place California where she belongs,
in the vanguard of the Union.
It was at this precise time that the railroad, under
Democratic leadership, accomplished its deepest
treachery to the Republican party and to the State.
It proclaimed broadcast its absolute and irrevocable
withdrawal from interference with politics. Its decla
rations were accepted and acted upon in good faith,
and the banner of national Republicanism was carried
to a triumphant success. Hardly was the election
over, however, when the railroad pledges were boldly
repudiated, the determination to send its agent to
Washington avowed and the unprecedented candidacy
THE SAJST FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 13, 189<>.
of Dan Burns disclosed, which was ratified by him
self on January 2, 1890. For nine weeks, in the face
' of unanimous public sentiment among representative
and patriotic citizens within and without the Repub
: lican party, this malignant purpose to substitute a
corporation tool and a disgraced and incompetent
politician for a Federal Senator has been obstinately
pressed, and "rule or ruin" has been the alternative
presented 'by the railroad through its Democratic
i leader, aided surreptitiously by the Examiner, to the
' Republican majority in the Legislature.
The existence of this situation in itself is shameful.
But so far, in the face of such pressure as has been
rajely brought to bear in a similar emergency, the in
; tegrity of the Republican party has been maintained.
Twenty-seven legislators, including members who for
yt^rs have fathered and advocated vicious and cinch
| ing legislation, have denied the representative princi
i pie and violated their' obligations to their constituents,
while fifty-eiirh.t legislators, however divided in their
I preferences, so far have refused to bow their knees to
Baal and to become parties to the conspiracy, of
which Dan Burns is the figurehead, to turn California
I over to the Democracy in 1000. It is upon these gen
tlemen that the people must depend to prevent the
I consummation of this- crowning railroad outrage.
Even though consciously worthy and fit.' if Dan Burns
had possessed a scintilla of statesmanship or political
I manhood he would long ago have realized that the
election of any particular man to a Federal Senatorship
can never be a necessity to a million and a half of
Americans, who arc in possession of the elective
franchise and, with no backing except from a detested
monopoly, he would have yielded to the popular will
and have sacrificed his personal ambition for the sake
'of the party and for 'the common good. But from
him no disinterestedness, no appreciation of the truth,
i no allegiance except to himself and to the corrupt
I power that dominates him need be anticipated. Al
though unqualified and disqualified, although rejected
; by the solid mass of Republicans, he will stick and
; hang, and he and his emissaries will continue to bawl
that the' great' State of California has only one man
; who has a lien upon the Senatorshipand that his name
â¢is Burns. Reliance must therefore still be placed upon
the fifty-eight legislators who have so far saved the
day and who, if they defeat the railroad project, even
though the seat of Senator White remain vacant for
two years, will intrench the political organization to
: which they belong in public confidence and esteem by
proving that it can maintain its own integrity and ful
fill its own obligations against any corrupt and selfish
combination that corporate presumption and political
antagonism can devise. Senator Perkins is respect
able in intellect, in attainments, in experience, in indus
try and in character, but the election of Dan. Burns
would reduce him to the position of a detective for
his State, while locally the Republican party would
be anathema maranatha. This outcome of the dead
lock can only be prevented either, by adjournment
without a choice, or, more effectually, by the prompt
eiection of a Republican, a statesman and a gentleman.
ThjE SEASON OF GRAND OPERA.
rOR the grand opera company, for its brilliart
stars, for the nebulous lesser lights of chorus and
orchestra that surround them, for all parts of the
galaxy of music and song, San Francisco has the most
cordial welcome in her heart. She will manifest it
again and again during the season by the clapping of
hands, by rapturous recalls, by gifts of flowers and,
indeed, by every form of delighted approval the con
ventionalities of our civilization permits.
The fashion of great capitals and imperial courts
has made attendance upon grand opera a high social
function which all people of pretensions have to at
tend, whether they like it or can afford it or not.
Furthermore, there is always in every community a
considerable class who have a dominating desire to
sec and to hear whatever is most talked of, and that
ctoss is always ready to pay a high price for novelties
of any kind whether they be prize-fighters, artists or
stitc dignitaries.
Both the social swells and the curiosity seekers will
be well represented at every performance of the opera,
Kit they will not be sufficiently strong to give the tone
to the audiences or materially affect the spirit with
which the music and its gifted interpreters will be re
ceived. San Francisco is essentially a musical city,
cosmopolitan in its culture and its taste- in that di
rection, capable of drawing from- its population a
host of devotees to the French, the German, the
Italian, c even the Russian school of music, but all
united in a genuine appreciation of whatsoever is high
Lim noble in the art.
The liberal support which will be given to the grand
opera even at the high prices fixed for. chairs, stalls
and boxes cannot be regarded other than as an evi
dence that the people have a profound longing for
what is truly graceful, sweet and marked with the
dignity of lofty endeavor. Schiller has told us "wit
wars with beauty everlastingly." Its lambent flame of
mockery, varying from pleasant jest to offensive
sneer, blazes continually around every temple where
Beauty is enshrined, but never succeeds in destroy
ing it.
Men in their mistaken conceptions of their own
nature may say they like fun and frolic and farces and
something that makes them laugh better than they
like the fair ideals great artists fashion for us, but
when the test comes and a noble form of beauty ap
peals to them they yield a ready homage to its power.
So now when the brilliant stars of the opera siiig for
us the sweetest strains of music to which mortal ears
arc attuned all of us who have the opportunity will
turn aside gladly from coarser joys and live for a
season in the delight of their entrancing art. â¢
According to a Pittsburg paper 'an Alderman of
Chicago has fined a resident of that city $25 for lying.
The statement has every air of improbability. In the
first place an Alderman has no authority for doing
such a thing, and in the second place he would not
recognize a lie as an offense. It must be remembered
that Chicago is the center of the embalmed beef in
dustry-
A naval officer has declined promotion because he
did not think he had earned it. While there is sup
posed to be nothing new under the sun, occasionally
some citizen does manage to establish a precedent.
Perhaps one reason everybody refuses to pull chest
nuts out of the fire for Burns is that they have
scrutinized the coals and ascertained that there is
nothing there but the chance of getting burned.
An Eastern authority declares that the boldest oper
ators on Wall street keep half drunk all the time. We
are inclined to question this. Russell Sage has al
ways been pictured as a model of sobriety.
Admiral Dewey should come home if He feel* like
it. There arc enough "special commissioners" of yel
low sheets in Manila now to run his job.
Porto Rico's glad acclaim over the arrival of the
Americans seems to have been delivered through the
Porto Rican hat.
France has fired a correspondent for failing to main
tain reserve, but had he maintained it his paper would
have fired him.

fail, and several counties north of
Tehachapi are likely to orga-nize and
Join for the first time. The movement
to extend the organization and make
this strong and effective association a
State society In fact is being vigorous
ly pushed by Secretary E. H. Benja
min, whose recent correspondence with
leading mining men of the South prom
| ises success there.
One of the leaders in the movement
down there is O. S. Bresse of the ilia
ing and Metallurgical Journal, who re
cently wrote: "Through persistent in
terviews with leading mining men I
have discovered a surprising ignorance
as to the purposes of the association.
When these purposes are properly ex
plained they take hold of the .proDOsi
tlon 'with considerable enthusiasm.
With the advances made by your or
ganization there is no reason now why
I there should not be an organization in
every county of Southern California."
The idea of one organization with
! headquarters in Los Angeles is also ad
vanced. A preliminary meeting will
! soon be held and when the Legislature
adjourns President Neff and Secretary
Benjamin will make an organizing trip
I through the Southern region. In Tuol
umne County many leading mine own
ers and superintendents are interested
in organization which will soen be ef
fected. The plan is being urged there
of letting every miner employed know
that he is expected to join the county
organization at a cost of $1 a year.
CALIFORNIA ANTIMONY, ITS BOOM
AND PECULIAR MARKET.
The price of antimony has recently ad
vanced, partly in sympathy with th
eral rise In the metal market, and this
and a wider and more lively interest, in
the metal among prospectors and miners
promises an increase in the California
product. Last year but forty tons were
produced in the State, while in former
years the amount has been 130 tons. The
metal cuts a small figure in the mineral
industry of the State, but there are a
good many interesting things to be known
about it.
One thing not generally, known is that
owing to the metallurgical difficulties pi
i working antimony ores none of the big
custom smeltera anywhere produce anti
mony or want anything to do with ores in
which ft is an element. Penalties art
charged for it^ presence. There are but
seven antimony smelters in the world,
and the special plants and processes re
quired are used for nothing else. One is
In San Francisco, two are in London and
there is one eacli in Japan, France, Aus
tria and New York. The San Francisco
smelter is one of San Francisco's unob
served industries. It is a little institution
at Ninth find Division streets, operating
pecret processes and working twenty-four
hours a rlny with 12 men divided Into two
shifts.. During Ik'.<s this smelter produced
300 tons of the commercial metal, the ore
coming from Nevada. Utah. Idaho and
cis. where on the coast, California con
tributing but forty tons. This product
represents the working of about <'> r| o tons
of ore. The ore is stibnite. or sulphide of
antimony. Stibnite is found in many
counties of the State, but especially in an
eight-mile mineral belt in San Benito
County, where it is associated with cin
nabar, and in Kern County. A good many
antimony claims have been located, anil
there are many listed antimony mines in
the State, but only two or three are pro
ducing, and that fitfully. Many others arc
being clung to, exploited and offered for
sale, but the peculiarities of antimony
mining keep the mine owners from dnintr
much besides wondering why they can't
make a little money.
Chemically pure antimony is worth $3
r pounrt. or $6000 a ton, but in its commer
cial forms its price ranges from S to 40
cents. The common form of metallic an
timony lias risr-n here from $.085 to $.096
since December. The price is madp by
the Pacific Coast monopoly, the Chap
man Smelting Works Company, which
regulates its figures by New York and
London prices. The Japanese product is
the only thorn in Its side, and when a
shipment frcm Japan is risked prices are
cut and it is announced that no Japanese
antimony will be allowed to not anybody
a dollar over here. Some time agtj ten
tons wore imported froni Japan for
and it was sold last Friday at $.075. The
Chapman company succeeded three years
ago to the plant and business of the Cjom
pany now operating In New York. A
number of interesting things were told
nbnut the business the otht-r day by c
Solomon Jr., the head of the Pacific Coast
concern.
"The product of the roaet Is yet small,"
he said. "It supplies the coast demand
and leaves some for shipment East. San
Francisco consumes about sixty tons a
year. It is used by machine shops for
Babbitt metal, for chilled shot, by type
founders ami stereotypers and for "the
work of type setting machines. We ship
ped a carload of sixteen tons to St. Louis
tlii' otber day, and have sent several car
loads there in the past few months. Cali
fornia could and will produce a great deal
more, but there is so much about th<=>
business that the miners don't under
stand. There are plenty of antimony
mines in the State, but only a few wiil
pay to work, because the ore is not rich
enough. We refuse to buy ore that car
ries leÂ«s than 40 per cent antimony. Pure
stihnite carries 71.4 of antimony and
28.6 of sulphur. Other metals are always
in the ore, and working is a costly pro
cess. Only forty pounds of ore are
used at a charge, and it goes through the
tire three times. Our commercially pure
product gives this analysis: Antimony.
99.47; arsenic, .132; lead, .042; copper. .015,
and iron, .23, together with some other
Impurities. The smelting processes used
are secret, and, of course, not patented.
The metallurgical methods of refining an
timony are well known, but by following
the books the cost Would be from $1 to
$1 50 a pound. The improvements are kept
as business secrets. We use .the Hallett
process used by one of the London smelt
ers, anfl the Cookson process is used in
New York and by tln> other London firm,
th-' two -American firms having secured
pupils of the originators of the pro
cesses.
"One feature of the business is that the
antimony miners are always kicking and
thinking that they are beirig robbed.
They can't understand some things. They
expect returns on the assay value of th>ir
oreÃ, as with other ores, but some of the
antimony is always lost, and antimony
ores are always paid for by 'quality and
produce 1 only. Another tnystery to them
is that they get nothing for the gold and
silver in their ores. All the ore w<> get
carries gold and silver, but it is .disre
garded and thrown away. Tin' ore will
carry from $2 to $20 a ton in gold and from
five to fifty ounces of silver, but it would
cost from $200 to $300 a ton to get it out. I
have received bo many kicks about this
that I wrote recently to Vivian. Younger
& Bond of London to learn their practice,
and here you see they Bay: 'We could not
make any payment for gold and silver
contents, for you \are doubtless await
that the problem of separating tire
ious metals frum antimony is om of th"
most difficult problems of the day and
the inventor of any cheap process for
doing this would soon make a fortune.'
Not very long ago I offered ore carrying
200 ounces of silver and 40 per cent anti
money V 3 a big Denver smelting company
and they would not give nnythim; for it.
You see, an assay may give a. prospector
a wrong idea of the value of his claim.
The assay may Bhow 50 per cent anti
money and $75 a ton In gold and silver,
and he thinks h<* has a rich find. lie
gets pHirt for 5 to S per cent less anti
mony than the assay shows and nothing
for his gold and silver and he Curses the
smelter.
"A California shipper gets about $IL'
less for his ore than he could get In New
York, but this is the railroad charge to
New York. The Kern County ore we
get averages 50 per cent of antimony.
The miner would receive 130 n tun f.o.b,
at San Francisco. If he is twenty nillcs
from a railroad it -will net him, say, $:::: :it
the mine, which is better than the aver
age gold mine. There arc many large
deposits running from ir. to 88 per cent,
but it does noi pay now to work such ore.
There is a Rood market for th.- ore and
many claim need development more than
they >i" ;i promoter."
That is the California antimony situa
tion and tbese are the terms and oinii
tlons offered by the Pacific Coast
monopoly.. The lending mine now pro
ducing is about twenty miles from M,,
Jave. with on eighty-foot ahuft. Bomt
drifts and 100 tons of ore on the dump,
which the owner will not sell just now.
OBSERVATIONS ON SOME DESERT
MINING DISTRICTS.
W. F. Newell, expert for the Selbys. has
return*! from a three weeks tour of the
Randsburg and adjacent mining districts,
where' he sized the situation up m
"I found Randsburg very quiet . ne
says. "The boom is all over and now is
Quietly flourishing on what is actually
being done in the mines. â¢ eT * h S the
hotel there since the last fire ana tne
streets are quiet The Yellow Aster mine
is the big thing or the camp, producing
from $50,000 .to $60,000 a month- *y ha 9
just started its new thirty-stamp mill and
no longer ships to Barstow. are
other good mines and a number of small
properties are being worked in a email
way by owners without capital*
"The" principal talk and the main at
tention oi ! prospectors is directed to the
Argus and slate ranges just west of the
Panamint district. In the Argus range
John Kosenfeld & Sons are running a
good mine, milling the low grade and
shipping ore that runs $50 a ton or more.
The Slate Kant,'? Mining Company is
operating in that range, and there is a
good â  i ispectinig and developing
going on. In the Rademacher district 1
found the situation quiet, with good op
portunities that need capital. The dis
trict is undeveloped. There are some
good showings of ore, but it is base and
cannot lie miiled to advantage. There
area great many claims located, and some
good mines will result some day. One
hears a good deal about the Panamint
country, but it is so far from anywhere.
With hay at $60 a ton and freight at $20
and $2u, that only high-grade ores can be
handled and shipped. A great develop
ment would follow a railroad thruugn
that mining region.
"There is a good deal of life around
Mojave. "Mojave Mountain, four miles
away, 50 men are working on prospects.
One, the Karma mine, has a 60-foot shaft
in a ten-foot ledge and shows ore averag
ing ?25 to $30. There are a number of
promising prospects, and as the district
is only a few months old there undoubt
edly will be some good mines developed.
There* are two custom mills and a
cyanide plant at Mojave, and one mine
recently shipped 60 tons of $">0 ore to San
Francisco. About 100 tons a month are
corning here from Mojave."
The results of the session of the Legis- !
lature as far as the mining industry [a
concerned will be chiefly two thingsâ the
appropriation for a Paris exhibit in which
the miners will receive fair recognition,
and the amendment to the State law of
location doing away with the preliminary |
notice. The requirement of $5<J worth of
work within sixty days will remain, ac
cording to the present agreement and un- ;
derstanding, but instead of having to post
and ivcord at the county seat a prelimin-: i
ary notice of location and having to file i
a second notice sixty days later, but one |
notice will be required, but this must be
recorded with the County Recorder as |
now.
The State Mining Bureau, which re
viewed the ferry building some weeks ago,

Nearly Two Months
From Hawaii.
BARK DOMINION'S SMART RUN
LEFT THE ISLANDS A MONTH
AFTER THE SHIP.
Made the Voyage in Fifteen Days.
American Bark Carondelet Makes
the Run of the Season
From. Australia.
There are two British vessels named Do
minion, and one of them it* causing ship
ping men and underwriters considerable â 
anxiety. One is an old-timo bark, built j
of wood, twenty-four years ago, and the !
other is a splendid steel ship, constructed
only eight years ago. Strange to say, all
the anxiety is on account of the modern
ship.
The British ship Dominion left Hono
lulu for Puget Sound on January 19 last,
â¢while the British bark Dominion also left
Honolulu for Puget Sound on February
17. The bark reached her destination on
the 4th Inst., after a passage of fifteen
days, while the ship has not been heard
from since she left the islands fifty-two
days ago. Of course the British bark
Woollahara was forty-six days from Ha
waii to Eureka, but then she was thirty
days off port in fog and heavy weather
before a tug picked her up and towed her
in. Neither fog- nor heavy weather could
keep a vessel out of Puget Sound, but the
Dominion may have been driven far up*
north and be now beating her way back.
The ship Dominion was built in Sunder- j
land, England", in 1891, and is 2328 tons net !
burden. She is 294 feet long, 43 feet beam
and 24 feet draft. "When. here in 1897 she
was in command of Captain Meredith, :
and made the run from Swansea in the I
smart time of 117 days. Since then Cap
tain Meredith has left the vessel and I
Captain Jones is in command.
The bark Dominion, that made the very
fast run of fifteen days from Honolulu to j
Puget Sound, was built in Canada in 1875. 'â¢
She is 1214 tons net burden, 199.9 feet long, j
37.1 feet beam and 12.2 feet draft. At one 1
time she was owned by T. P. H. White
law, who put her under the Xicaraguan.
flag. He sent her to Sydney, N. S. \V.,
where the captain sold her and pocketed
the money. Her Australian owners put- her j
back under the English nag and sent her I
to Honolulu with a load of coal,
whence both she and the ship Dominion |
Failed in ballast. In March, 1895, the bark I
was so long making a trip from San Fran
cisco to Puget Sound that she was given
up for lost, and now, two years later, I
the ship is so long overdue that fears are
entertained for her safety.
The schooner Helen N. Kimball is now
out 100 days from Eureka for Panama.
Her owners do not' know what to make
of the long passage, but are in hopes
that the steamer Acapulco, due here next
Thursday from Panama, will bring some '
news of the schooner. Mr. Kimball j
thinks that the vessel has reached her
destination and that the captain â¢ has
failed to notify them of her arrival.
The American bark Carondelet arrived
in port Saturday night, after a very
speedy passage of 63 days fro/n New
castle, N. S. W. The bark Suoma is now
out S3 days, and the bark Prussia 79 days
from the same port, while the Brussels
and the M. P. Grace were so long on the
way that 5 per cent reinsurance was paid i
on them. Of all the vessels in port from
Australia, the 1 â¢ days" run of the Brit
ish <jÂ»jneral is the nearest to the Caron

Maitlnnd hurricane, the insurance men ,
did not favor her chances and 6 per cent |
reinsurance was paid on her. The Brit- i
ish ship Ceutesima and the British bark j
Cardigan Castle were each 82 days, the '
Brenda 84, the Leicester Castle 86 and the
Brussels 100, while the American ship M. j
P. Grace was 102 days coming from Aus- !
tralia to San Francisco. It will easily j
be seen, therefore, than Captain Stetson, |
of the Carondelet, has reason to be proud
of his 68-day run.
During the voyage of the Carondelet
from Puget Sound to Australia, Captain
Stetson sighted a reef which he says is
not down in James Imray & Sons' chart
nor in Findlay's South Pacific directory.
"It was on August 31, 1898, in latitude
5 deg. 35 mm. south, longitude 173 deg. 68
mm. west, that I passed the reef,"
cays Captain Stetson. "We were with
in two miles of It, and I consider
it very dangerous. It extends about
a quarter of a mile northeast by
north and southwest by south, and at
times It was barely noticeable from the |
deck and at others the sea was breaking :
heavily upon it. On my arrival at Ade- I
laide, South Australia, 40 days later, my j
chronometer was 10 miles east. I called
It Carondelet reef."
It was very rough on the bay yester- '
day, and the excursionists who ventured J
out to the battleship lowa and cruiser
Chitose had a rough time. On. the home
ward run from the Japanese warship
everybody aboard the launches got a
ducking. Visitors to either vessel were
very few, and the tug boats that carried
passengers did not pay expenses. During j
the afternoon it blew 40 miles an hour !
from the northwest aÂ£ Point Reyes and j
Point Bonlta, and at. sundown was still
increasing.
During the afternoon the schooner Mil
dred got in from Kahului and the Otillie
Fjord from Harua, H. I. The former took
17 and the latter 14 days to make the
run. Both are sugar laden.
Much interest was manifested in ship- '
ping circles last week over the demand
made by the transport authorities for
Bailing tonnage to convey military stores
to Manila. Major Long, the quarter
master in charge of the transport depart
ment, had over seven thousand tons of
miscellaneous goods, all badly wanted in
Manila on his hands. As no steamers |
were available, he called for tenders for j
Balling vessels, and the owners or agents \
of nearly all the large ships in port sent
in tenders. When the bids were opened ,
on Wednesday last it was found that the
lowest, sent in by J. D. Sprockets & Bros.
Co was for the Bidston Hail, a big
English iron ship of over 4000 tons ca- !
pacity. They offered to carry a full cargo
of weight and measurement for $20,500,
or about $4.50 per ton. The other bids
Tanged up to $5.50 a ton. In accordance j
with the practice of the department, all
the bids were Bent to Washington for j
final acceptance, but there is no doubt |
the offer of the Bldston Hall will be ac- ]
cepted.
Another sailing vessel chartered by the \
Government Is the Marion Chilcott. be
longing to Messrs. Barnesson and Chil- I
cott, of Seattle. The ship is to load at
Seattle and will carry about 2000 tons at '
S5 50 a ton. The steamer Cleveland, be
longing to Messrs. Nelson & Co., of this :
c lv has also been chartered. Her ca
pacity is some UW) tons, but the rate of |
freight is at present unknown. I
Speaking of these transactions, a well- I
known shipping man, who has large in- j
terests on the coast, remarked that San
Francisco has nothing to fear from the
competition of Seattle. "The facilities
here are in even- way better, he said. |
"There is more tonnage available, and
the Government will always get a better
rate from this port.' Even if Seattle does
offer free docks, it would not make up
the difference. All that San Francisco
has to do is to be alive to her own in
terest and to see that every shipping i
facility is granted to the national trans
ports. The best of our docks should be
placed at their disposal, .and no effort
should be spared to retain the trade in
this port." â¢ â

THE OVERDUE BRITISH SHIP DOMINION.
THE above cut is reproduced from The Call of September 25, 1896. On that occasion she made an unusually long voyage and was sixty t
days getting from 30 in the Atlantic to 40 in the Pacific. For weeks at a time she was hove-to, off the Horn, under a goose-winged
lower topsail, and got a terrible battering. She is now out fifty-two days from Honolulu for Puget Sound, and as the bark Dominion,
which left the islands a month after the ship, reached her destination on the 4th inst., much anxiety is felt for her safety.
THE SOUTHERN
PACIFIC BARS
SAN FRANCISCO
Prohibitive Rates Are
Imposed.
THE PAGO-PAGO CONTRACT
WHY THE MATERIAL WAS
SHIPPED IN THE EAST.
The Contractors Unable to Pay High
Railroad Charges â A Large
Shipment Lost to
This City.
The Pago-Pago coaling station contract
affords an admirable illustration, on a
small scale, of the manner in which trade
is lost to San Francisco through the pro
hibitive transcontinental rates imposed
by the Southern Pacific. Some months
ago. when the Washington authorities
finally decided to erect an elaborate coal
ing station in the Samoan group, tenders
were called for in this city. The prize
was awarded to Messrs. Healy/ Tibbits &
Co who undertook the construction of
the' work at a cost, including extras, of
something like two hundred thousand dol
lars The contract called for the con
struction of a long steel wharf, carried
out into deep water, besides a big steel
shed, capable of storing five I thousand
tons of coal, a car track and every mud
ern convenience for handling this most
important article of war. .
Healy Tibbita & Co. having secured the
contract went to work with energy, for
they have to complete .the whole work
within the present year. They soon
found that the conditions of the market
rendered it impossible to get all the iron
work manufactured in San Francisco.
The contract for the steel piling, by far
the heaviest portion of the structure was
given to the Carnegie Works at Pittsburg,
while the smaller iron castings were made
in San Francisco.
Then came the question of shipment
There was a big cargo fifteen hundred
tons of steel piling, a large quantity of
cast iron, machinery, engines tools of all
kinds not to mention 284,000 feet of lum
ber All this amounted to more than
three thousand tons, and the firm entered
into negotiations with several large iron
shins wHh a view df getting the whole
cargo transported to- Pago-Pago in one
bottom The charter was almost, com
nleted when the railway company stepped

ijeniv yesterday. It would na/ie oeeu
much* more convenient for us in every
way But what could we do in the face
rf such prohibitive rates? The fact is,
the railway people thought they had us
in a tight corner, and that we would be
forced to pay their figures. For a time
it looked as If thtir scheme was goln~ to
work We : couldTaot ship from an East
ern port because a sailing vessel would
have taken too long on the voyage, and a
steamer would have cost too much. So
I went to Washington, and. fortunately
the raval authorities allowed us to char
ter-*? a good figure, too-a portion of the
paceon Tward the Abarenda, the collier
which was to take coal to Samoa .
Thus the steel made by Carnegie has
never come West at all. and San Fran
cisco lost the handling of a big cargo.
wnile the Southern Pacific lost a large
sum which it might have gained had it
opened its mouth less widely. The result
is that or.lv some 1200 or 1300 tons of cargo
remains to ship from this port. Yesterday
Healy Tibbits & Co. completed the char
ter of 'a small vessel. for the purpose. The
â¢shin will leave here about the end of
April and should' make Pago-Pago early
in June. Mr. Tibbits will go to Samoa
hi-iself to superintend operations, taking
with him about forty skilled mechanics
and engineers . â - .

Pathetic Suicide of Poor Old William

William G. Bobbins, aged 50 years, a
native of England, committed suicide by
turning on the gas in his room at the
Soto House, 32 Fourth street, sometime
during Saturday night." " There was no
gas fixings in the room, but from the
gas pipe which was intended for use as
a side bracket he unscrewed the cap; but
before doing BO nailed some towels over
the transom and placed hi? clothing at
the bottom of the door so the gas could
not escape. Ho then lay down on the

[LETTER TO MRS. pinkham no. 12,733]
"I am very grateful to you for your
kindness and the interest you have
taken in me, and truly believe your
medicines and advice are worth more
to a woman than all the doctors in the
world. For years I had female troubles
and did nothing for them. Of course
I became no' better and finally broke
down â¢ entirely. My troubles began
with inflammation, and hemorrhages
from the kidneys, then inflammation,'
congestion and falling of the womb
and inflammation of ovaries.
" I underwent local treatment every
day for some time; then after nearly,
two months the doctor gave me permis-
sion to go back to work. I went back,
but in less than a week was com-
pelled to give up and go to bed. On-
breaking down the second time, I de-
cided to let doctors and their medicine
alone and try your remedies. Before
the first bottle was gone I felt the ef-
fects of it. Three bottles of Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and a
package of her Sanative Wash did me
more good than all the doctors' treat-
ments and medicine.
"The -first remark that greets me
now is 'How much better you look!' and
you may be sure I never hesitate to tell
the cause of my health." â Mbs. E. J.

by the clubâ with a score of 17 out of a
possible 20.

steward on tne Kaduk. The two met at Honolulu when they were bo
Thn^rd the Centennial, and Geisson took a strong fancy to the boy At the
request of the young fellow, whose name was Haas. Geisson allowed him tQ
assume the latter name. Last year Geisson shipped as steward of the
Kariuk and his protege as cabin boy. Three months ago. when the whaler
returned to San Francisco. Geisson and the boy secured a room at the Maine
House Cl 4 Kearney street, the former paying the rent. Some time after thjs
Geislon started on a protracted spree, and when the room rent was due
the WiÂ°thout money or' friends, young Geisson was compelled to live as best
he could. By performing odd jobs he managed to secure sufficient fOOO to
keen him -alive, but box cars, wharves and open stables were his sleeping
nKces The hardships he endured brought on an attack of pneumonia. Two
â¢ weeks' ago he met Geisson and they again took a room at the Maine
House Both on last Monday shipped anew on the Kariuk.
. Saturday morning the boy was taken violently ill. He was found on the
floor of his room in a delirium and the landlord, fearing ho might die in the
house notified the police at the California street station that the lad had
taken' rough on rats. The patrol wagon was sent to the house and young
Geisson was taken to the Harbor Hospital with all possible haste,
Dr Yon der Leith was told that the boy had taken poison, and without
investigating used the stomach "pump on the Buffering lad. Gefsson utterly
collapsed during the operation and was placed on a cot. The physician later
discovered that the patient had pneumonia and began treatment for that
disease, but tho boy died shortly before noon, yesterday.
The body was removed to the morgue by Deputy Coroner Sullivan, and
last night Dr. Zabala performed an autopsy. A puncture was found in the
oesophagus, but the immediate cause of death was pneumonia. The punc
ture is believed by Dr. Zabala to be due to some corrosive poison. No poison
was found in the room of young Geisson, but a bottle of whisky and bit
ters which he had was given to the chemist for analysis.
STIFF BREEZE BLEW
ON OAKLAND CREEK
SLOOP FLASH WON THE NAVY
BACE YESTERDAY.
Nereid Alone of the Canoes Com
pleted the Course and Won the
Mayrisca Badge.
On an ebb tide, and with a pood west
erly breeze, that kept freshening all the
time, the canoes Nereid, Whim. Vitesse
and Gnat, and the sloops Beatrice and
Flash, sailed the third race of the Oak
land Navy yesterday over the usual tri
angular course on the San Antonio
estuary. Of the canoes, Nereid was the
only one that finished, the skippers of
Gnat and Vitesse going overboard and
retiring from the race.
The starting gun was flred at 12:49 p.
m.. and the time of all boats taken from
that moment. The wind was stiff enough
to give the sloops an advantage over the
canoes, so that at the end of the first
round the yacht Flash was in the lead,
and increased her lead on each round of
the course, ultimately finishing in. an
elapsed time of 1 hour 18 minutes and 44
seconds, beating the canoe Nereid by
nearly eight minutes. The sloop Beatrice
was sailing well, but in gibing round one
of the marks the strap of the main sheet
carried away and she was compelled to
retire. The canoe Whim completed two
rounds, but did not cross the finishing
line. The results are shown in the table:

SHOT LIVE TARGETS
FOR GOLDEN MEDALS
OLYMPIC GUN GLUB OPENS ITS
ANNUAL SHOOT.
The initial medal shoot of the Olympic
Gun Club for the season opened at the
club's grounds, near Ingleside, yesterday
morning.
The gunners were divided into three
classes, a medal being hung up for each
clasp. All who entered the match wero
arbitrarily classified on the basis of their
known records and ability. The "cham
pion class' contained four of the best
shots on the coast, J. S. Fanning, C.
Nauman, Frank Maskey and C. A.
Haight. The others shot in classes A
and B.
A cold wind was blowing over the traps
when "Slade" faced the mark for the
first bird of his dozen, the match being
at twelve birds. "Slade." class A.
killed 9. Others in the same class scored
as follows: H. H. White 10, C. A. Stone
8, F. Johnson 8, L. D. Owens 11, C. F. |
Grant 9 and M. E. Unger 11. In the cham
pion class Fanning lost one bird, scoring j
11; Haight killed 12, Markey 12 and Nau
mar 12. There promises to be an inter- â¢
I esting battle for the medal in this class. .
I Although Fanning fell behind one bird in :
I yesterday's match, he would perhaps :
stand as favorite against the field if he i
could remain throughout the contest, but, i
as big Eastern tournaments will demand
his attention, he will be unable to finish.
In class B. A. Roos and H. E. Rose
broke even, each killing 10 birds; H. B.
Hosmer centered 6 and Paul Delmas 9.
This ends the line of contestants for |
the medals, but Harvey McMurchy of
Syracuse, N. V., and S. A. Tucker of
Meriden, Conn., as guests of the club
shot out yesterday's score. The guests, j
both well-known wing shots, were classed
with the champions and placed with Fan
ning at thirty-one yards.
Although, as stated, Nauman, Haight
and Maskey each killed all their birds,
and will put up a good tight for the cham
pion class medal, there are still others to
be considered. Next month Will and
Harry Golcher, both "high gun" men,
will shoot up their scores and get even fn
the contest and then the hard shooting
for the first class medal will begin.
The records of some of yesterday's con
testants were doubtless lowered by the
high wind, birds that were centered and j
killed being carried out of bounds.
Tucker lost one bird that dropped dead
outside the bound. White 1, Stone 1,
Johnson 1 and Hosmer 3.

CLOSE OF THE
STORY OF THE
SHARPSHOOTER
Death of Capt. Theo
dore T. Watt.
SHIP AND HEALTH SHATTERED
HEROIC BATTLE ON THE GALE-
SWEPT SEAS.
Never Recovered From the Loss of
His Bark and Died leaving
His Family in Pov
erty.
The end of a life's weary voyage and
an unusually sad story came when Cap
tain Theodore Thomas Watt died at his
residence, 540 Chestnut street, last Satur
day.
Something- over two years have passed
since the most dreary wreck of a craft in
ballast came creeping into this harbor.
All of her upper spars and most of her
lower ones, for that matter, had parted
from her,, and a couple of jury-masts, on
which hung several jury-sails, composed
her rig. She was neither ship bark nor
brig, and old sailors shivered at the
thoughts of what had been Her expe
rience out at sea. Her hull was stained
with iron rust, and the grass grew
long amid the beds of barnacles that
covered the hulk below the water line.
The vessel was the little English iron
bark Sharpshooter, and Captain T. T.
Watt stood on her tiny quarterdeck. By
his side was his wife and three little
children. For weeks they had fought
their way through a fearful storm on the
Mexican coast. Days and nights had
followed each other while the gale swept
around them, beating the spars out of the
bark, drifting here and there over the
tempest-lashed billows. How nobly Cap
tain AVatt had struggled for his ship and
familyâ his all on earthâ the shattered
hulk and awkwardly rigged jury masts
and yards told well. Some steamer had
found the Sharpshooter floundering like
a lame duck in the long swells off the
Mexican shores and dragged her into
port, a pitiful spectacle of wreck, a
broken down captain, a weary wife and
three small children gazing solemnly over
The luck of Captain Watt by no means
came back with his miraculous rescue at
sea. Something went wrong with the in
surance on his all but wrecked bark, and
the poor Sharpshooter lay at her anchor
in the bay a melancholy picture for
months. Finally he disposed of the hulk
and moved his family ashore. The ves
sel was repaired by her new owners, J. t .
Cunningham & Co.. at an expense obout
equal to her total value, and sent to sea
in barkentine rig.
Watt never appeared to recover from
his misfortunes, and the splendid courage
that nerved him to rig jury masts and
yards and save his vessel from the fury
of a Mexican gale seemed to leave him.
The storms that wrecked his vessel shat
tered his health, and he grew weaker un
til his life voyage ended.
He was a native of Newfoundland,
aged 49 years. Mrs. Watt, the heroine of
the Sharpshooter, and the three liitle
children of the wreck survive him.

The Junior Order.
Or. the evening of Friday, the "Ist inst.,
there will be a union meeting of the sev
eral councils of the Junior Order of
United American Mechanics, when V. S.
Grant Council of this city will be the
host. An elaborate programme is being
prepared. It will include addresses from
several of the most prominent members
of the order and features of music and
song.
This council is advancing satisfactorily.
At the last held meeting there were pres
ent at least fifty members, who were en
tertained and instructed by remarks from
delegates to the State Council.
During the current winter months the
council has v paid monthly an average. of
$250 in sick benefits to Its members a
Abraham Lincoln Council has received
a report to Hie effect that one of its mem
bers at the front with thÂ« California Vol
unteers was recently killed in battle on
the Island of Luzon. An inquiry has been
started and if it turns out that the report
is correct the council will perpetuate his
memory.
The delegates from the different coun
cils are interesting themselves with mat
ters that are- to come before the ap
proaching State Council. There will be
many candidates for the several offices
and the greatest interest centers in the
office? of State councilor and State sec
retary. Â«*"THAT METALLIC
RING MEANS
MORE MONEY
Prices of Metal Soar
Skyward.
FOUNDRYMEN ARE IN TROUBLE
NAILS AND TIN CANS MAY BE
LUXURIES.
Steel and Iron Higher, While Copper,
Brass and Tin Rise Fifty to
One Hundred Per
Cent.
The recent phenomenal advances In the
prices of the Industrial metals has been
severely felt by the local manufacturers
and who ; esale jobbers. The pressure is
Just beginning- to be felt by the retail con
"""cr *- and it will be appreciated much
more in the near future, when nearly ev
erything in the metal line, from a tin pail,
a pound of nails or a bunch of wire to a
copper kettle, a brass nozzle or a stove.
will cost from 10 to 50 per cent more than
the prices that have ruled for a good
while.
The effects of the advances in the prices
or trw m, t.iis are various and compli
cated. The chief reason for increasing
prices being the higher cost of raw ma
terial, prices of ma- goods will
advance in about t: .::o as the
proportion of cost represented by the raw
material. When la!. or and skill are the
chief element of cost, prices will ad
vance but little. Wire, nails, structural
steel, rough and large castings, etc., will
advance the most.
With Bteel billets soaring to $22 at Pitts
burg, with every mill and forge, sold up
to six months ahead, and with
plates, sheets, etc., difficult to get at the
advanced prices, many people whose busi
ness â  el materials are in
trouble. Structural material costs $2 a
ton more than on January 1, and builders
must pay the advance.
The difft ; â  Â£ a modern office
building or a steel bridge now and three
months ago would amount to a bigr sum.
Those who will suftVr most are contract
ors who had contracts on hand when the
advance came, for which the steel had
not been secured. ThÂ»- lucky ones were
those who had a big steel" supply
tracted for at the old prices. Man;
pie are speculating- as to how the Fnion
Iron Works stand with the advanc
the Scotts are not telling their bus
The advanc- in pig iron is felt by more
people than the advance in steel. This
has jumped $3 and $4 a ton. and
dries of the ell ally the smaller
oni-s. say that they are runni^
There is such keen competitii n I
are afraid I I i their pri â 
creased m^t of iron. They are holding
their trade and waiting for the gradual
nt that must come. The pig
iron situation was thus treated by S. R.
Church, the metal broker:
â¢'The rise will be felt first by the small
founders, who are generally busy and
. who carry slight stocks. Some "of the
larger concerns have good stocks on hand,
and will benefit by the rise. The bay re
gion consumes about 15.000 tons of pig iron
yearly, exclusive- erf about 3000 tons used
by the Sacramento shops. There is now
on hand about 9800 tons, of Which the
Union Iron Works hold about 2000 tons.
American pig has about displaced Scotch
and English irons here. Half comes from
the List by rail and half by Cape Horn.
The bulk of the supply is from Tona
wanda, X. V. Pig iron here is now at
$20 50 to $22, as compared with $18 25 to
$20 sixty days ago. The furnaces are sold
six months ahead, and there . is every
promise of further advances."
The first advances in prices have natur
ally been made by the jobbers. Stoves
haw- been recently advanced 10 per cent.
A stove that would cost $25 two months
ago will cost $27 50 to-day. The grosser
forms of iron and steel, such as sheet
iron, plates, nails, wire. pipe. etc.. have
advanced in the local wholesale mark- 1
from 30 to 40 per cent over December
prices. Light cast-iron casting, such as
brackets and locks, cost about 10 per
cent more. Galvanized iron has advanc
ed 30 per cent and certain classes of block
iron sheets 20 per cent. The greater ad
vance in galvanized iron is due to the
heavy rise in zinc.
Copper and brass goods are soaring still
higher. Local jobbers quote 22% cents
for copper plates, sold at 14 cents three
months ago. The brass and copper
founders suffer as much as the iron men.
One manufacturer said that prices on
manufactured goods had not risen as
high as they would. Copper pipe was 50
cents a pound, instead of 45 cents, and a
big copper kettle that could have been
bought for $60 before Christmas would
cost $70 now. Ingot copper cost 20 cents
in ton lots here last week, or IS cents In
carload lots, a recent advance of about S
cents. Copper has nearly doubled in
price and simple bra castings, such as
nozzles, are up about 50 per cent.
Then tin goes climbing upward, partly
as a result of the advance in metals and
partly because the new big trust, the
American Tinplate Company, has gained
absolute control. This is going to par
ticularly affect the packers of canned
goods who are the chief consum
ers of tinplate. Local jobbers in tin
plate have advanced prices 50 to 60 per
cent but they do not know what prices
the trust will be pleased to make when it
gets around to that matter. After se
curing control of most of the tinplate
mills the trust ceased quoting prices on
January 1, and has since been getting its
affairs in shape. Since then no pur
chases have been made at the mills.
Local stocks are generally getting low,
though some dealers and canmakers wen?
lucky enough to make good contracts
with Eastern mills before the trust got
them Any additions to the stocks pos
sessed or contracted for before January
have been secured from Eastern jobbers.
The trust has announced that a Pacific
Coast representative will soon be estab
lished here and then prices will be quot
ed Everything awaits the pleasure and
convenience of the trust. No consumer
can now secure an advantageous contract
covering any considerable time.
Afl a general thing, the retailers about
town are afraid to raise prices, and seek
to hold trade by selling their stock on
hand at the old figures and buying as
little new stock as. possible. The market
is demoralized generally, but retail ad
vances for all manner of metal wares will
coon be observed.

FAILS TO GO BY
THE GAS ROUTE
Made Grand Prepara

DISCOVERED OPPORTUNELY
REFUSES TO GIVE INFORMATION
ABOUT HIMSELF.
Had Addressed Envelopes to Four
Women in Los Angeles,
but He Wrote No
Letters.
A man giving his name as Frank
Behne attempted to commit suicide at the
Mariposa House, 116 ft Mission street, early
this morning.
At 12:30 the landlady of the house de
tected a strong odor of gas, and upon
making an investigation found the door
of Behne's room locked, the transom fas
tened down and the keyhole stopped up.
Breaking into the room they found Behne
on the bed unconscious and the gas escap
ing from all the jets.
At the Receiving Hospital he recovered
sufficiently to speak, but refused to tell
why he tried to take his life. He stated
that he had a good reason for wishing to
die. but would not giv. that reason.
Before turning on the gas the would-be
suicide had addressed four envelopes as
follows:
Mrs. A. W. Barrett. 1007 Burlington
street. L<>s Angeles, Cal.
Mrs. J. Mullb^rry, 115 Requena street,
Los Angeles.
Mrs. Mary William?, 1381 East Twenty
! first street. Los Angeles.
Mrs. Capen Ellis, 539 Wolfskin avenue,
Los Angeles.
No letters were found, and it is sup
posed that Behne changed his mind
about writing them after having first
prepared the envelopes. From the deter
mined manner in which he keens his
â  I it is thought that he has somÂ»
urgent reasons for his desire to destroy
himself. Behne appears to be fairly in
telligent, is well <ir"ssÂ« ! and a man of
middle age. He insists thru he desires to
die, but will not give any information

MAKES A GREAT SPRINT
ONE MILE IN 1:35 AGAINST A
HEAVY WIND.
: Hardy Downing Wins the Mile Pro
fessional Event From Good
man and Lawson at San
Jose.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 12.â The bicycle
races this afternoon were run in a
howling northwest gale, but were a
success both In point of number of
spectators and the time made. The
star features in a local way were an
exhibition half mile by Otto Zeigler
and an exhibitioin mile by McFarland.
Neither lowered the world's record, al
though McFarland was announced to
go for the world's mile exhibition time.
While he did not win the coveted honor
he made a magnificent run, and beat
the "infernal" machine, with the
howling wind against him, carrying
clpuds of dust, and with a pace which
was far and away too slow. He made
the mile in 1:35.
This was the last event on the pro
gramme, and two or three laps had to
be made on the third-of-a-mile track
before the "infernal" machine, ridden
by Fournier and Stevens, could get up
steam. When the word was given they
were off at a magnificent burst of
speed. It was not believed McFarland
could hang on to the machine, but he
did. In the final lap the machine could
not respond to McFarland's calls of
"Faster," so on the stretch he rode
around it and beat it out. McFarland's
time at the laps was: :30 1-5, 1:02, and
for the mile 1:35.
Zeigler in his half mile exhibition
was not able to drive the machine, and
was about two yards behind at the fin
ish. Time, :49 3-5. It was a beautiful
race, and Zeigler did well. He had
had but three days' training, and this
marks his return to the track. He ex
pects to go East from here.
In the ten-mile lap race ten started,
but only six finished. The pace was
hot, and Fredericks, Nawn and Charles
Turville were far ahead of Lawaon,
Clem Turville and Julius.
The results were as follows:
One-mile open professional, paced by
tandemâ l 'owning won, Goodman second,
Latrsdn third: time. 2:11 1-5.

yards; "Baby"" Gibson third, with 300
yards. Time. 3:591-5.
Ten-mile lap raceâ Charles Turville
won. Fredericks second, Nawn third;
time. 25:11.
The prizes were awarded according to
the points wonâ that is the lapsâ and the

The cycling season opened yesterday,
and was marked by two of the biggest
runs held by the local clubs in some
time. The Bay City Wheelmen took 51
members to Camp Taylor. The good,
roads and cool weather made the run
very delightful, and the men were agree
ably surprised to find a substantial meal
awaiting them at their destination. The
place has heretofore been noted for its
pour treatment of cyclists, but a new
management has overcome that diffi
culty. The following members, attended
the ride, which covered over 30 milc3 all

Captain Snillane led a party of 45
Olympic Wheelmen to the beach and
back by way of Ingleside to the club's
outdoor grounds, where a new bicycle
track has recently been constructed. A
picnic lunch was pervod there, and the
men spent the remainder of the after
noon trying their sprinting- abilities upon
it. The only actual race was a match
between Charles Albert Adams, James
\V. Mullen and F. G. Montealegre, which
was won by Mullen in 6:22 for the mile.
A half-mile foot race on the cinder path
was won by George Fuller, George James
second. Harry Cosgriff third. Captain
Splllane and Captain Menne say that
judging from the large attendance and
enthusiasm of yesterday's runs tour
ing cycling will probably be much in
favor this year.
A match race on bicycles was ridden
from Oakland to San Jose yesterday
morning between some of the prominent
jockeys at the track. The starters were
Piegott, "Skeets" Martin. Cash Sloan,
Thorpe. Rutter. Eddie Jones, Shields,
Cray and Fremont Sloan. Piggott and
Martin were paced, the former having Al
Welnig and the latter Eddie Leonart.
Piggott won. riding the 42 miles In 2
hours 40 minutes; Martin was five min
utes behind him. Shields. Gray and Fre
mont Slnan were last, half an hour later,
and had to buy dinner for the party in
consequence.

REJOICE THAT
IRE CAMPAIGN
IS ALL OVER
Oniy the Ballots to
Count To-Night.
A CHANCE FOR BUSINESS
SOME CLOSE FINISHES ARE EX
PECTED.
Nothing Lew Has Been Brought Out,
Although Oakland lias Been
in a Ferment for a^
Month.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. March 12.
A f rr-Ur-ET of satisfaction pervades Oak
lard to-night and everybody is congratu
latincr everybody else that it is a l .! over.
Tr-jr. there is to be an election to-mor
row, but that h- comparatively a minor
affair. I* is the campaign to which the
city objects, i specially such a campaign
ns the one just concluded. Oaklanders
are peculiar i:i one respect. They buy
their Hour and their perfume and their
bread. ;;s a rule, from the man who votes
.bp they do. Society and commerce move
In cliques, and the ma;i with anything at
stake is always on pins and needles at
campaign time. Anonymous circulars,
slanders ami cross calumnies all
have a tail in an Oakland campaign, and
a man's standing, although h< may be
perfectly innocent in the matter, can be
materially altered in twenty-four hours.
These tilings are unpleasant. They dis
normai conditions and justify the
cry of the merchants that there Is
much politics in the city tor the city's
good.
re will be a fr-w months during
which this city can turn its attention to
matters that are of equal mommt with
politics, and which produce more lucra
tive and beneficial results. Such intense
Interest is displayed in politics that every
excuse to organize a "campaign" is eager
ly grasped and used as a justification t"..r
turning the town upside down. Mer
chants are Tired of it, the average citizen
Is tired of it and only the political poli
ticians foster the industry for personal
gain and because they do not want to find
them- â  of a job. Such cam
paigns, of course, serve to distribute
money, but they bring no new money
here. What would otherwise go into the
legitimate channels of trade Is gambled
on politics, so that in the end a campaign
has had no other effect that to ruffle the
ordinary course <>t events, which are no
better for being ruffled, but probably
worse. Special elections, primaries and
general elections have disturbed Oakland
for over a year and each event has been
accompanied by a "campaign." Now
there appears to be a chance to do a lit
tle business till the summer of next year,
when the question of a successor to Presi
dent McKlnley will engross public at
tention.
To-night, one can any kind of poli
tics he wants. Such supreme confidence
In the rival camps has rarely been
equaled. Mr. Snow and Mr. Davie are
both to be elected Mayor and the same
in statement is made with regard to
the balance of the tickets. Then; is do
denying th.- fact that there Is not a big
margin on either side, so far as the gen
eral city ticket is concerned. If the Re
publicans i-ote their ticket it will win. if
th<=-y split up it will lose. Will the party
hold together? Experience has shown
that sometimes it duet and sometimes it
does not. The party has great hope in
Mr. Snow, as lie has always carried the
of i he party when running: for ten
years for I'ity Auditor. Somehow or
other, there is generally a surprise in
the vote for Mayor, so that on the whole
to-morrow's election is a thing to conjure
with. 1 do not believe there will he a
majority "!' 500 for anybodj running for
the Board of Public Works, which co
of Mayor, City Attorney and City Engi
neer.
Now that half the politicians of the
riiy have been talking against the other
half for over a month. 1 would like to
know what has been accomplished or
who has been enlightened. Mr. Snow was
as well known two years ago as he is to
night, and John L. Davle has been a pri
vate citizen for me pa.-; two years, and
i verything said for it against him now
was said two years ago. when he was run
ning against Mayor Thomas. The same
is true of the other candidates. The only
Issue that 1 can detect has been that oi
personality. Bach faction has tried io
build up by tearing the other fellow down,
and I do not believe the vote to-morrow
will be any different from what it would
have been had it taken place a month
ago. In the meantime, some reputations
been blasted, some enmities engen
that will live to the grave, and
Truth has been blushing since the first
campaign speech was made. But it Is
all over now, and the folly and useless
ness of much of ii must he admitted by
an impartial judge. The ballots will be
counted befon to-morrow'a midnight, the
crow! that Inhabited Broadway at cam
paign timi-s will have returned to that
bourne which will shelter i; until Mazuma
appears once more, and Oakland will
gladly brush the political down from Its
counter and return to business.
Who knows that there was an ami mi
mem t<> the clty'a constitutional law to
be voted for to-morrow? Probably nut a
hundred \ct. is. and certainly no candi
date has referred to it from the public
platform. So much pains have been
taken to invite voters to inspect the
"op'-n book" of candidates lives that ihis
Important amendment has been entirely
forgotten. However, it Is fitting to call
attention to It, for ii affects ihe very
weeds in our gardens. In fact, it aff- eta
nothing else. Jt vails for an expression
of the people regarding the adoption of
a i.?< cm act of the Legislature regulating
tiit- growth of certain obnoxious weeds.
r;k! should be adopted. The amendment
om< what the same relation to the
rest of tin- ticket as the celebrated poppy
bill to the balance of this year's legisla
tion at Sacramento.
For the political reputations of some of
districts of this city it is sincerely to
be hoped that some plan will be found
In Senator Btratton's primary law. If the
act must stand it is to be desired that
all records ol past primaries will never
be brought up for comparison. Fancy a.
Stratton primary in the Sixth Ward, or
the Fourth, or In the fast two years in
the Seventh, How would it compare with
the returns in the Hilborn-Metcalf pri
mary or the Jordan-LÂ«eckle primary, or
nearly every other primary. or with thai
celebrated primary four years ago, when
more Republican (?) votes were cast than
there were people In the ward?

Preachers and the Election.
OAKLAND, March 12.â The municipal
election, which tak.s place to-anorrow,
was touched upon by some of the local
ministers in their preludes to-night Rev.
c If. Hill. )>astor of the Tenth Avenue
F.aptisi Church, in a clear and forcible
manner explained what he considered the
"voter** du'y," while Rev. C. 11. Hobart,
pastor of the First Baptist Church, spoke
interestingly upon "The American King
and His Ballot-box Throne."
"What Our City Needs" was the sub
ject of Rev. E. R. Dille's discourse at the
First M. E. Church to-night. He treated
the topics as apropos of the election and
also In Its general sense. He pointed out
the need of a civic conscience, and said
the good people of the city must be that
conscience,
"We should not be ruled by partisan
ship," continued the speaker, "and we
must not be cajoled by the term inde
pendent. Some who were Populists last
year are Independents to-day and some
Who were Democrats last year are Re
â¢ publicans now. It reminds me of Jaj
Gould, who, when he was in a Demo-
I cratic State was a Democrat; when in
! a Republican State, he was a Republi
jcan; and he was neutral whenever in a
neutral State, but he was for the Erie
Railway always. Beware of political Hes
sians Who are in politics for revenue only
: and always. We should carry our re
ligion into our politics. A man should
go to the ballot box as reverentially ah
â¢ he goes to tin- communion table.

George Foster, an Alameda contractor,

few days ajju and had it removed from
his groin Mr. Foster swallowed the

him much pain. Later it apparently

time Mr. Foster experienced np trouble.
Gradually however, his health tailed and
his case puzzled the physicians. None ol
their remedies afforded him rellei. For
years he suffered excruciating pains,
which gradually changed their location
from the vicinity of the lungs to the re
gion ot the abdomen. Mr. Foster had
forgotten about the nail, until about ten
days ago when his sickness became so
severe that he was forced to take to
bis bed. , ,
Physicians were summoned and upon
examination found a discolored mark ex
tending across Mr. Foster's body trom
the left lung cavity to the region of the
groin. Beneath the skin over the groin
i the discoloration was most pronounced,
and close examination showed that some
hard substance was imbedded in the

' the substance might be it was the cause
of Mr Foster's illness. The surgeon's
knife was brought into uae and to the
astonishment of the doctors the shingle

previous was removed. The patient has
improved rapidly since the operation and

<THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 13, 1899.
O'BRIEN JURY
CALLED BEFORE
THE GRAND JURY
Could Not Agree Upon
a Verdict.
SENSATION IS LOOKED FOR
SEVERAL UGLY RUMORS OF
JURY FIXING HEARD.
On the Previous Trial the Defendant
Was Convicted and Sentenced to
Ten Years' Imprison
ment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 12.
The jury that tried James F. O'Brien of
Livermore, charged with criminally as
saulting Miss Ogilvie de B. Lopez, has
been cited to appear before the Grand
Jury for investigation next Tuesday
morning, and sensational developments
are looked for.
The case went to the jury shortly after
noon yesterday, and at about 12:30 o'clock
this morning, having failed to arrive at
any agreement as to a verdict, Judge
Ellsworth discharged them. They stood
nine for acquittal and three for convic
tion. The jury was made up as follows:
P. S. Amarel, Henry Hauschildt, John
Seebeck. A. O. Perry, P. Swords, C. E.
Bowman, K. Consadine, 11. Menges, W.
11. Lee, J. -Madden, P. Kerney and Hiram
Bailey.
Ugly rumors wire afloat on the streets
and in the courthouse corridors as soon as
the jury had been selected. In fact, whis
pers of "fixing," of "prejudice" and "fa
voritism" were heard frequently. Much
difficulty was experienced in selecting the
jury. The regular panel had been ex
hausted and a special venire issued. Then
it was stated that friends of the defense
had scattered the right kind of people
along Broadway and near the courtnouse,
so that the dejuty sheriff to whom was
assigned the duty of subpenaing jurors
could not help stumbling against
O'Brien's friends.
It was noticeable when the jurors were
examined as to their qualifications that
the prosecution frequently asked whether
the juror under examination was ac
quainted with a certain local wholesale
liquor dealer. The point involved was
that of an attempt to show partiality, in
asmuch as the defendant's father is en
gaged in the saloon business, as are also
several of the jurors. It was unofficially
charged that a certain brick contractor
had "talked" with some of the jurors,
and during the last few days of the trial
Judge Ellsworth admonished the jury not
to discuss the case with any one. utter
ing the admonition in such stentorian
tones that it attracted no small attention.
That these rumors reached the ears of
the court and prosecution is indicated by
the fact that only a few days ago Judge
Ellsworth, Chief Deputy District Attor
ney Melvin and M. < '. Chapman of coun
sel for the prosecution held a long confer
ence, during which "a suspected juror
was discussed. However, it was deemed
inadvisable to take any action until the
jury had been given an opportunity to
deliberate and determine O'Brien's fate.
Much interest is manifested in the ulti
mate outcome of the O'Brien cause and
the result of the proposed investigation
by the Grand Jury. Although the de
fendant and prosecuting witness are non
residents, the courtroom was thronged
with the friends of cither party until late
last night, awaiting a verdict from the
jury.
O'Brien was first tried last May, and the
case proved one of the must sensational
ever tried in local courts. O'Brien on that
occasion was convicted and sentenced to
ten years' imprisonment, but his attor
neys secured for him a new trial on er
rors. The second trial has been in prog
ress since February 23 last, and has
proved but little less sensational than the
first. And now O'Brien will be put on
trial once more.
At the opening of the case O'Brien's
father was reputed a wealthy man. To
day it is said his property is .-ni timbered
on account of his endeavors to save his
son from prison. The prosecution of
O'Hrien this time was conducted by I>'p
uty District Attorney Phil Walsh, and
associated with him were ex-Mayor M. C.
Chapman and Attorney Tom Scott of Su
nol. The defense's interests were looked
after by Attorney Frank MoGowan of
S:'?i Francisco.
BURNED WITH HOT GREASE.
Frank Metzler, a Cook, Meets With a
Serious Accident.
Frank Metzler. a cook employed In the
New Louvre on O'Farrell street, was se
verely burned about the face and hands
last evening by hot grease. Metzler was
emerging from the kitchen with a pot of
hot stuff when he stumbled and fell, part
of the burning fluid striking him on the
face and hands.
His screams for help attracted the at
tention of Max Strohbaeh. the head
waiter, who went to his assistance After
applying flour to the burns Strohbaeh
summoned a hack and had the unfortu
nate man remove,) to the Receiving Hos
pital. Dr. Maher applied the usual reme

BORN IN A HOSPITAL.
Pitiable Plight of a Woman Who Was
Deserted by Her Husband.
Maggie Powers, a middle-aged woman,
gave birth to a girl baby in the Receiv
ing Hospital last evening. The unfortu
nate woman was found sitting on a door
step on Post street, near Larkin, at 5
o'clock yesterday morning. She was at
once removed to the Receiving Hospital,
where the necessary attention was given
her.
According to her story her husband left
her about two weeks ago, after telling her
that he was going to Seattle, where a
position had been promised him. She had
saved $45. and, realizing that she would
be confined in a short time, she claims she
gave the amount to Mrs. D. Wyeth, a
doctress. who has an office at BIS Post
street.
"As I had not sufficient money to pro
vide even the necessaries of life." tear
fully remarked the woman last night, "I
applied to an employment agent to secure
a position for me as a domestic. After wait
ing several days I finally was sent for to
take a position as servant in a house on
Guerrero street. Yesterday morning I
became ill, and, acting on the suggestion
of my employer, 1 w r ent to the residence
of Dr. Wyeth, but was told that I could
not enter unless I gave up more money.
Disgusted beyond measure I walked
downstairs and sat on the steps of the
house, and groaning I remained there for
several hours, when a citizen, who evi

begged him to take me to the Receiving
Hospital, which he did.
The baby has been named Rosie Keane
Powers by request of the day matron,
who took a great interest in the woman
and intends to see that she does not want
for anything.
Both mother and daughter are doing
well.

EXPOSITION
FAVORED BY
LABOR'S SONS
Opposition of Building Trades
Council Is Withdrawn.
At a Special Meeting Yesterday It Was
Decided That the Organization Would
Support the Proposed Fair.
THE only organized opposition to the
proposed Pacific Ocean and Interna
tional Exposition to be held In 13W
has been overcome and the fair is
now virtually an assured fact. Owing to
a misapprehension on the part o. the
I'.uilding Trades Council, that organiza
tion was at first opposed to the big enter
prise Yesterday a meeting of the council j
was held, and after the matter had been
thoroughly mv. Stigated -i resolution waa
r as=ed which not only indicated that the
proposition would receive no opposition
but assured the prime movers in the un
dertaking that the council was heartily
!n favor of the exposition and would give
substantial support in making it a sue-
When the exposition was first talked of
the Building Trades Council people were
interviewed by some parties interested in
having the plans fail. The members of
the council were told that the proposed
exposition would be under the same man
agement as that of the Midwinter Fair.
At the time the buildings for the latter
exposition were erected there was consid
erable dissatisfaction among the laboring
people on account of the fact that men
were brought from the East to construct
the buildings, when plenty of home labor
could be secured. Wages were cut down
under the schedule set by the trades
unions, and union men could not work for
the money offered.
The Building Trades Council, hearing
that the Pacific Ocean Exposition would
treat labor as did the managers of the
Midwinter Fair, naturally took sided
against the proposed exposition. The Ex- ;
aminer has opposed the exposition, which |
it Is believed will be of great benefit
to California, and when it learned
of the dissatisfaction of the coun
cil made much of it. Members of
the council were told by representatives
of that paper that organized labor would
receive no consideration from the mana- j
gers, and on the strength of this informa- j
tton the council took a decided stand j
against the exposition. Interviews with j
prominent members of the council, who ,
believed what they were told, were print- j
ed in the Examiner and added fuel to ihe i
NICARAGUA CANAL WILL
CERTAINLY BE BUILT;
CONGRESSMAN J. A. BARHAM
SO DECLARES.
He Tells of Difficulties Encountered
by the House Committee in
Having a Favorable Bill
Passed.
"The Nicaragua canal will be built as
sure as the sun shines in the heavens."
These are the words of Congressman Bar
ham of the First District, who has just
returned from Washington, D. C, with
his wife, son and daughter. Mr. Barham
told of the difficulties experienced by the
Interstate and Foreign Commerce
House Committee in having a
measure passed which will insure
the construction of the canal. This
bill authorizes the President to employ
an unlimited force of men to prepare
plans for the proposed improvement, mili
tary and civil engineers among others,
who will present a report at the next ses-
Blon of Congress, when an appropriation
will undoubtedly be made to carry out the
recommendations as to the most feasible
route.
"The great difficulty we encountered,"
continued Mr. Barham, "was that four
members of the committee offered bills
for consideration, and after much discus
-Bion that of Colonel Hepburn of lowa was
found to be the simplest and best of all.
I suggested that his bill be taken up, and
the only objection to it was that it pro
vided that the United States should have
absolute sovereignty over the strip of ter
ritory upon which the canal will be built.
Now the Costa Rican and Nicaraguan
Governments expressly forbid the trasfer
of the sovereignty of any portion of the
soil, and the word "sovereignty" was
stricken out. The bill further ignored
any consideration of the Maritime Canal
Company to pay its claim of $5,000,000, as
embodied In the Morgan bill. There was
to be no concession for the one and a half
miles which the company had constructed,
besides eleven miles of railroad and nu
merous jetties. -That was an after con
sideration for the Government to deter
mine. The bill was to be tacked on to the
river and harbor bill, but the latter passed
the House before the amendment could
be reported.
"f" endeavored to have the Hepburn bill
put on the river and harbor bill in tho
Senate, but it was denied on the ground
that the territory in question was for
eign. This was in direct contravention
to the improvements made by the Gov
ernment at Pearl harbor and Pago Pago.
I told Senator White then that unless it
was put on the sundry civil bill in the
Senate I would move heaven and earth
to defeat the latter measure. The com
promise bill. was the result. This will in
sure the construction of the Nicaragua
canal. Of that I feel quite certain."
MEETING OF EDITORS.
Prepare for National Association's
Convention in Portland.
. The executive committee of the Califor
nia Press Association held a meeting at
the Occidental Hotel Saturday night. E.
B. Willis of the Sacramento Record-Union
presided, and the following editors were
also present: G. M. Francis of the Napa
Register: T. G. Danlells, Alameda Ar
gus; Raleigh Barcar, Vacaville Report
er; F. H. Owen, Winters Express; Dun
can McPherson. Santa Cruz Sentinel; R.
H. Jury, San Mateo Leader; J. A. Filcher,
Auburn Herald, and W. D. Pennycook,
Vallfjo Chronicle.
A subcommittee, consisting of Barcar,
Daniels and Pennycook, was appointed
by the chair to make arrangements for
the spring meeting of the association, to
be held next May. The committee has in
view Nevada City and Sonora as a place
to hold the convention, but it may choose
one not yet considered.
At the spring meeting ten delegates
from this State to the convention of the
National Editorial Association, to be held
in Portland, Or., will be elected.
T. G. Daniells, national committeeman
of the association, read an extended re
port of the meeting of the national com
mittee held last February in St. Louis,
Jn which a Eugene Field session in con
nection with the Portland meeting was
strongly recommended and will be car
ried into effect.
A Switchman Crushed to Death.
James Barley, a switchman in the em
ploy of the Southern Pacific Company,
while engaged in coupling cars at Fourth
and Townsend streets at 11 o'clock Sat
urday night, was caught between two
care and terribly crushed. He was con
veyed to St. Mary's Hospital, where it
wa's found that his ribs had been broken
and his thigh and pelvis injured. Death
ensued at 11 o'clock yesterday forenoon.
Barley was 38 years of age, and had been
in the employ of the company for about
six years.
Anakesis cures Piles, nothing else. Sam
nlÂ« free. Address Anakesis. New York. â¢
flame of opposition which had sprung up
in the council.
Learning- of the position the council
had taken in the matter, Hon. Charles L.
Patton, the chairman of the legislative
committee of the propose... exposition, de
termined to ascertain the cause of the op
position, and discovered that it was en
tirely due to a misapprehension. He
addressed a communication to P. H. Mc-
Carthy, the president of the council, in
viting the organization to thoroughly in
vestigate the methods and motives of the
managers of the proposed exposition.
Acting on the letter of Mr. Patton the
council, ever willing: to be just, appoint
ed a committee to look into the matter.
The committee, composed of Messrs. P.
H. McCarthy, the president; E. L. Mals
bary, L. J. Nevers and W. N. Page, wait
ed on Mr. Patton and heard the story as
told by the people favoring the exposi
tion, which differed materially from the
information given them by the opposi
tion. Further investigation by the com
mittee proved to the members that the
managers of the exposition were friendly
to organized labor and proposed to see
that the interests of the laboring men of
California should be well taken care of.
Yesterday a special meeting of the
Building Trades Council waa called and
the committee made its report. It laid
before the council the result of the thor
ough investigation which had been made
and advised that all opposition should be
withdrawn and that a resolution should
be adopted favoring the holding of the
exposition. The suggestion of the com
mittee was well received and the resolu
tion advised adopted almost unanimously.
The action of the council yesterday vir
tually assures the passage of the $500,000
appropriation bill which is a special order
of business in the Assembly to-day. A
number of the members of the council are
in the Assembly and Senate, and these
on account of the feeling of the building
and trades people have been opposing the
passage of the bill. These legislators will
be notified to-day that the council is
heartily in favor of the exposition and
they will be urged to vote for the appro
priation. A member of the council will be
sent to Sacramento this morning to ac
quaint the Assemblymen with the action
taken by that body yesterday and to ask
them to support the bill. At the next
meeting the council will appoint a com
mittee to work with the managers of the
exposition in their effort to make it a
success.
RUNAWAY ACCIDENTS
ON THE PARK ROADS
JUDGE KERRIGAN NARROWLY
ESCAPES BEING ARRESTED.
H. C. Siem. and a Young- Lady Are
Thrown From a Buggy, but Es
cape Serious Injury.
Despite the fierce north wind that blew
the dust In clouds along- the park roads
yesterday there was the usual large Sun
day crowd gathered for the weekly out-
Jng-.
Late in the afternoon a maddened horse
under the guidance of H. C. Siem broke
his reins and played havoc with the
driver. The horse raced down the north
drive, and upsetting- the buggy at the
juncture of the bicycle path with the main
drive below the Francis Drake cross,
slipped the harness and tore down the
narrow cycle road toward the beach.
Siem was thrown, as was the young lady
with him. The lady was uninjured, but
the driver of the wild steed landed on his
head. He was carried to the Park Emer
gency Hospital, where he was examined.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAKL, MONDAY, MARCH 13, 1899.
SIGNOR CEPPI TO
SING WITH MELBA
The Famous Italian Tenor En
Route to San Francisco.
Manager Charles Ellis was as
happy as a big sunflower yesterday
over the receipt of a dispatch from
Signor Ceppi of the Metropolitan
Opera Company announcing that he
would arrive in San Francisco to
morrow evening. Several weeks ago
Mr. Ellis opened negotiations with
the famous Italian tenor, but at
that time the signor's engagements
in New York precluded the idea of
a trip to the Pacific Coast with the
Ellis Company. That matters have
been so arranged that he will join
the galaxy of stars at the Grand
Opera House so soon is good cause
for rejoicing not only by Mr. Ellis
but by all lovers of grand opera in
San Francisco.
Signor Ceppi is one of the greatest
of Italian heroic tenors. He will
make his debut on Thursday evening
with Gadski in "Aida." This of
course has necessitated a change in
the repertoire of the Ellis Opera
Company, and to-morrow evening
in the place of "Aida" will be given
the double bill of "Cavalleria Rusti
cana." and "I Pagliacci." with Sig
norina Rosalia Chalia in the roles
of Santuzza and Nedda. This double
bill is one of the strongest cards of
the company, and the opportunity
of hearing this great lyric soprano
will no doubt be eagerly welcomed
by the public of San Francisco.
Pandolfini and Bensaude will both
appear to-morrow evening. Chalia,
who is of Spanish extraction, is a
young lady who has already at
but no serious injuries were found by the
attendant medicos..
While returning from the Cliff House
Judge Kerrigan, in company with R. A.
Auzerais, was stopped for fast driving.
Kerrigan, who was handling the reins,
lost control of his horse and a park po
liceman catching sight of the outfit
deemed it wise to arrest its mad career.
The explanations which the Judge of
fered did not satisfy the officer and the |
former would have been placed in the j
lockup had not H. J. Moore arrived Just I
in time to vouch for the Identity of the .
Judge. The officer finally allowed the \
Judge to proceed on the promise that
Auzerals would take the ribbons.
FUNERAL OF DR. MUFFE.
A Great Throng Attends the Services
in Masonic Temple.
Many people who desired to attend the
funeral ceremony of the late Dr. Fred
erick P. Muffe were unable to gain ad
mission into Masonic Temple yesterday
afternoon. Hundreds of friends of the
family crowded the hall long before the
hour set for the services, and when the
Js, are the two men at the bottom of
the bay, or did they abandon the boat
to avoid paying for the use of it?
Lieutenant of Police Anderson of the
Potrero station is inclined to accept
the latter view as the solution of the
mystery. Nevertheless, he is making
every effort to ascertain if anybody is
missing. Policemen in the South San
Francisco district are making inces
sant inquiries and a detail was sent
out to search the wharves yesterday
for anything that would throw light
on the case. Nothing to indicate who
the men were or what became of them
was found. Nobody has been reported
missing to the Potrero station. or to
the Chiefs office.
John Bonner, owner of the boat,
lives near the Arctic Oil Company's
wharf. He says that early Saturday
morning two young men, whom he
thinks, from their manner and accent,
tamed deserved prominence and
fame as an artist. Her voice is
sweet, pure and powerful, and in ad
dition she Is an actress of great nat
ural intensity. Her Santuzza is said
by critics to rank with that of any
actress who has ever played the
part.
Ceppi made his debut at the Thea
tre Dal Verne in Milan in 1894 in the
character of Manrlco. He is a pu
pil of the celebrated Boschini. After
achieving great success in Verdi's
early operas he studied to fit him
self for the greater requirements of
more intricate roles. He has sung
at Rome, Naples, Florence. Turin
and Covent Gardens, and in every
Instance his success has been won

They said they wished to row out to a
vessel at anchor and would pay for
the use of the boat when they return
ed. That was the last he saw of them.
Late in the afternoon he was inform
ed that a skiff had been found adrift
and he identified it as the boat he had
leased in the morning. Bonner's de
scription of the men is as follows:
One was about 25 years of age, 5 feet
11 inches tall, and slender. The sec
ond was about 22 years old, 5 feet 7

wore jean trousers and cap. The
boatman's indefinite description has
not aided the police any in getting a
trace of the men.

beat him out of his money, but left
the boat untied and it drifted down to
the iron works.
YOUNG McNUTT
CHALLENGED
TO A DUEL
" Baron " Rosenow
Thirsts for Blood.
MEDICAL STUDENTS EXCITED
JOKE TO BE EXPIATED ON
THE F IELD OF HONOR.
Sand Dunes in the Vicinity of the
Affiliated Colleges May Be
Drenched With Gore of
Combatants.
"You must fight me; I demand satis
faction for this insult, sir!"
"All right, old boy; what shall it beâ
swords or pistols?"
"Bah! It Is no joke. I shall send my
friend to you at once. Here is my card."
"Good for you. old hoss; here Is mine.
Send him along."
The above conversation, marked by sup
pressed excitement on the part of the
challenger and aggravating- nonchalance
on the part of the challenged, is alleged
to have taken place in the Toland Medical
School of the Affiliated Colleges several
days ago, and has since formed the ab
sorbing topic of discussion among the
student body. The youthful medicos are
now on the qul vive. Bones and tissues
are forgotten, and all interest in the
study of anatomy, osteotomy and kindred
matters are obscured in the prospect of a
real meeting on the field of honor between
a scion of German nobility and an Ameri
can aristocrat. For, be it known, the
central figures in this highly exciting epi
sode are none other than "Baron" Albert
Rosenow, late of Germany, and Fletcher
McNutt, son of Dr. W. F. McNutt of this
city. Both are credited with being fire
eaters and spillers of gore, and when
they come together something Is bound
to happen. In the meantime the dissect
ing room at the college has been con
verted into a debating club, where the
champions of the principals in the pro
posed duel indulge in heated discussions
of the relative merits of the men.
In appearance the "Baron" has the ad
vantage. He has all the earmarks of a
duelist, and it is whispered that he has
at least a dozen bloody victories to his
credit, won on the field of honor in the
old country. Then, too, the "Baron"
ignites with the facility of a parlor match,
something very desirable in a genuine
duellist of the old school, as the display
of pyrotechnics is calculated to fluster
the other fellow and cause him to lose his
nerve.
McNutt is disinclined to take life se
riously, and therefore would be disquali
fied to fight in the realm of the Kaiser, or
In any other realm where dueling is rec
ognized as legitimate among the "best
families." However, the "Baron" realizes
that his opponent has not had, the bene
fit of his experience in the business of sat
isfying honor, and will stretch a point in
McNutt's favor rather than be denied. It
is understood the seconds have been se
lected and the preliminaries all arranged,
and some nice moonlight night two young
men will seek a secluded spot in the vi
cinity of the colleges and proceed to be
spatter the surrounding sand dunes with
each other's gore until the tarnished
honor of the "Baron" has been restored to
its wonted brilliancy. Then they will
shake hands and swear to be friends for
evermore, pledge each other and their
seconds to secrecyâ and send a report of
the affair to the newspapers. That Is the
present programme, according to those
who pretend to be posted, but the con
test may take on a more sanguinary hue,
and instead of shaking hands after the
scrap one of the duelists may be com
pelled to shake the dust of the country
from his feet while the friends of his
late opponent are engaged in packing the
remains of their champion off to the
Morgue-^r the dissecting room.
It is not known just how the misunder- 1
standing arose, but it appears that
young McNutt, who is somewhat of a
joker, has been indulging in his natural
propensity of late s,t the expense of the
"Baron " Both are third-year men, and
the "Baron's" peculiarities of manner
and speech appear to have appealed ir
resistibly to McNutt's sense of humor.
Now the "Baron" has no humor in his
makeup. "With him life Is a serious mat
ter, and besides the "Baron" is a man of
family, which is in itself sufficient to
eliminate levity from the composition of
ordinary beings. As a result McNutt's
jokes, while appreciated by the majority
of his classmates, were not relished by
the noble German. He could not see
where the fun came in, and declared he
was being persecuted. Somebody told
him he could put a stop to the nuisance
only by challenging McNutt to mortal
combat, so the next time he bumped
against that young gentleman he declar
ed himself and issued his defi, which was
as promptly accepted, and now those
who are in on the secret are impatiently
awaiting the denouement.
When seen at his home, 2707 Sacra
mento street, yesterday the "Baron" de
nied that he had issued a challenge.
"I was all a joke," he explained. "We
had a little argument and somebody sug
gested that we should fight a duel with
selzer bottles or something of the kind.
But it is nothing, I assure you."
Probably some friend has Informed the
"Baron" that duels are prohibited in this
country and that If he wants to keep
out of jail he had better not advertise
the proposed set-to too promiscuously.
McNutt discreetly says he has received
no challenge, but does not deny the pos
sibility of being called out by the man
whose just wrath he has aroused. The
students are hopeful, and if the battle is
not pulled off because of police interfer
ence they will be the most disappointed
lot of medicos that ever wielded a
scalpel.
WAS THE CASE FIXED?
Way Yung Hung Acquitted of the
Murder of Wong Ah Loy for
Lack of Evidence.
The preliminary examination of Way
Yung Hung, alias Way Ah Bue, charged
with the murder of Wong Ah Loy, alias
Pon Mon, on Jackson street on February
26, was held before Judge Graham on Sat
urday. The police were unable to get any
Chinese witnesses to testify to the shoot
ing, and the only evidence was that of
Lieutenant Price, who caught the de
fendant while he was running away from
the scene of the crime. Four or five Chi
nese were shooting at the time, and the
defendant was wounded in the hand dur
ing the melee. The Judge had no other
course but to dismiss the case.
The police say that they have definite
information that $500 was paid by friends
of the defendant to the tong to which the
dead man belonged in consideration that
they would not prosecute the defendant.
Unfortunately they were unable to prove
it.

CABLED BABY'S BIBTH.
A Code Signal Flashed Tinder the Sea
From Far West Australia.
There was received in this city Febru
ary 16. 1899. from Coolgardie, Western
Australia, the following cablegram:
COOLGARDIE. W. A., Feb. 17. 1599.
R. Jordan, 2019 Washington St., San Fran
cisco. U. S. A.â Vestina. KEED.
The solution to this brief, mysterious
message appeared in The Call as follows:
REEDâ In Coolgardie. West Australia. Feb
ruary IT, 1899, to the wife of H. Lawrence
Reed, a daughter.
How the short story of this youngster's
advent was flashed over lands and under
seas is an interesting tale in itself. I* rom
the Australian coast the electric current
bearing the eighteen words traveled be
low the Indian Sea to Java, thence to
Singapore; to Penang, in the Malay
Peninsula; to Madras, in British India; to
Bombay; under the Arabian Sea to
Aden- up beneath the Red Sea to Suez:
overland to Alexandria; under the Medi
erranean Sea to Malta: thence to Gib
raltar; to Lisbon; to Penzance, in Eng
land; thence under the Atlantic to Canso.
Nova Scotia; overland to New York, and
the last great lap across the wide conti
nent to San Francisco. ___Â.. ,
The message started in English and
never changed from that tongue till it
landed in this city. There were probably
a dozen transfers, which delayed it about
seven hours, but as Coolgardie is some
thing like fifteen hours' difference in time
the news of the baby's birth was received
several hours before it was born, accord
ing to San Francisco time.
Mr and Mrs. Jordan are the grand
parents cf the young Australian heralded
by the electric spark around the world.
Mrs H. Ij. Reed, formerly Miss Mary
Jordan, removed to Coolgardie about two
years ago with her husband, who is a
mine manager and owner in that place.
Occasionally in their correspondence they
have recourse to the cable, using an ab
breviated private code for economy, as it
would ("bst a fair-sized fortune to tele
graph a family letter from Western Aus
tralia. In arranging the signal for re
porting to San Francisco the birth of the
baby they picked upon the word "Ves
tina" if it was a girl. Even this brief
message cost a goodly number of dollars',
but the cable stretching away under the
sea and over the lands crossing the me
ridians of longitude, ever reaching west
ward carried the word, "Vestina " and
when the telegraphic instruments by the
Golden Gatn had ticked off the dots and
dashes of those seven letters the srrand
parents knew that a little femare de
scendant had come to their line in the far
antipodes. _
HE SWALLOWED ARSENIC.
Daniel Fleming, a Laborer Out of
Work, Tries to Commit Suicide.
Daniel Fleming, a laborer living at 248
Clara street, attempted to commit sui
cide early yesterday morning by swal
lowing a dose of "Rough on Rats." He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital in
the ambulance, and the usual remedies
administered with successful results.
Fleming is a mnrried man about 30
years of age. When asked why he
wanted to dio he said he had been out of
work for two or three weeks, which
made him despondent, and he thought it
was better to get away from any more
trouble. He had been drinking, and it
was suspected that his attempt to poison
himself was more in the shape of a
"bluff" to frighten his wife than any
thing else.
A Bad Man.
Nicholas Mori, a peanut peddler on
the Barbary Coast, has been held to an
swer before the Superior Court by Judge
Graham on a charge of assault with a
deadly weapon in $1000 bonds. February
26 he slashed the face of Joseph Barbetta.
a fish dealer, with a knife. Four years
ago he stabbed a man on the coast, but
was acquitted. About a year ago he used
a knife upon another man and Inflicted
wounds that caused death. On that
charge also he was acquitted oiÂ» the
ground of self-defense.
A Brutal Husband.
Samuel Stare appeared in Judge Gra
ham's court Saturday to answer a charge
of battery upon his -wife. Bessie, who lives
at 101 Minna street. Friday afternoon he
knocked her down, jumped on her and
broke her right arm. She had support
ed him for seven years, as he refused to
work and was in the habit of beating her.
The case will come up to-day.
