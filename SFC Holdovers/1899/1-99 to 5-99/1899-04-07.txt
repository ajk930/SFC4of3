The American Consul, after discover

Torres, withdrew with the American
merchants, who accompanied him to

declined to state what steps will be

A vessel was chartered promptly, and
after considerable difficulty a clearance

The Consul, in these dispatches, asks
that at least two warships be sent to

About 2:30 th^ Presidential party, which

NEW YORK, April 7.â A few min
utes before 2 o'clock this (Friday)
morning fire broke out in the five-story
dwelling at 2 East Sixty-eighth street,
the home of Wallace Andrews, presi
dent of the New York Steam Heating
Company.
The fire spread very rapidly, and
though the firemen made desperate
efforts to get the inmates out of the
he-use they were only partially success
ful, for at least two lives were lost.
The victims are believed to be Mrs. St.
John, the daughter of Mr. Andrews,
who. with her husband and several chil
dren, lived with him, and Austin St.
John, 10 years old, Mr. Andrews' grand
son.
Several other members of the family
placed a bunch of roses on the casket of
their son, John O'Dowd of the Seventh
Infantry. The parents of Lieutenant
/Wood also .came forward and deposited
a beautiful 'wreath of flowers. The sword
of that gallant officer was upon his cas
ket.
Immediately the band broke out in the
sweet strains of "Nearer, My God, to
Thee," and Post Chaplain C. W. Froelajid
of Fort Monroe, with Rev. Father Mo
ot St. Patrick's Church, followed by
their purple-gowned acolytes, advanced
to the graves and the funeral services
began. They were simple, but very im
pressive. Rev. Mr. Frrcland read the mil
itary committal service of the Episcopal
church, beginning with "Man that is born
of woman," and concluding with the
premise of heaven contained in the words.
'I am the resurrection and the life." As
he pronounced the words, "dust to dust,
earth to earth," the soldiers at the side
of each grave crumbled a clod of earth
upon each casket. The vast concourse
bared their heads to the solemn words
<md ret iif and thousands joined in the
Lord's prayer. Rev. Father McGee then
consecrated with the churchly power in
vested in him the earth into which tho
bodies of the Catholic soldiers were
placed.
Meantime from Fort Meyer booming
down the wind came the dull crack of a
gun every half hour and the national en
signs on the staffs there and at the Lee
mansion were run down to half-mast. As
soon as the religious services had been
concluded flanking detachments of the
Fourth and Fifth Artillery fired three
ear-smashing, soul-uplifting volleys, and
in the solemn hush that followed the
salute the bugle sounded "taps."
The last religious and military rites to
the dead heroes were over and the Presi
dential party and the military departed,
leaving the work of actual interment to
follow. As each of the caskets weighs
almost 500 pounds and requires eight men
to handle it. it will be two or three days
before all the' bodies are in their graves.
In order to permit all the Government
employes to attend the services this aft
ernoon all the departments and Federal
courts were closed by an executive order
of the President and all the flags in the
city were half-masted.
were carried out unconscious.
The house is in the very heart of the
district occupied by the homes of New
York's richest millionaires. The house
on the corner is occupied by H. O.
Armour, the wealthy beef packer. The
house at No. 4 Is occupied by Mr
Rothschild.
The firemen found it impossible to
save the Andrews house and devoted
most of their energies to saving the
Armour and Rothschild properties.
Many times both were on fire, but
the vigilance r.-f the firemen as often
put out the flames.

from the Cuban junket such pressure will
be brought to bear upon him as will cause
him to place his resignation in the hands

McKinley served during the war is said
with positiveness to be slated as Alger's

PLAN MEETING FAVOR
Washington Is Willing, but Britain
Might Become Involved in
the Far East.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 6.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele-
graphs: State Department officials are
watching with great interest the crow
ing sentiment among the inhabitants of
Jamaica in favor of the annexation of
the Leeward Islands to the United
States. Thus far, the matter has not
been brought to their attention in any
official way, but It is not doubted that
the American Consuls in these islands
will, if the agitation continues, find it
incumbent upon them to make special
confidential reports on the subject.
Officials of the department consider
the subject rather a delicate one to dis
cuss publicly, but they have been read
ing with keen interest all that has been
said in the Herald concerning: the
proposition for the exchange of the
Philippines for the Leeward Islands.
While not consenting to be quoted on
the subject, they do not hesitate to
say that the United States would
doubtless be glad to make the exchange
if Great Britain would be willing to un
dertake negotiations. They do not con
sider, however, that the administration
could, properly initiate the matter at
this time. A petition from the people
of the islands, formally presented to
the British Government, will, In their
opinion, be the first legitimate move in
the direction of official negotiations.
The general belief among public men
here is that it is mainly a question as
to whether Great Britain would be will
ing to relinquish sovereignty over the
Leeward Islands in return for the
Philippines. As far as the United
States is concerned, it is thought pub
lic sentiment here would be entirely
favorable to the trade.
On this point former Senator Faulk
ner, a member of the recent Canadian
Commission, said to-day that he doubt-
ed very much whether Great Britain
would care to run counter to the opin
ion which would undoubtedly develop
from other European countries against
her acquirement of the eastern archi
pelago and the consequent prestige she
would gain in the Orient.
"Of course, the United States would
be more than willing to make the ex
change," said Mr. Faulkner. "Wo do
not want to keep the Philippines. We
would like the British West Indies.
They would be of immense value to
us, without the grave responsibilities
that surround the holding of the Philip
pines. The Philippines, on the other
hand, would be far more valuable to
Great Britain than the Leeward
Islands. They would give her an im
mense advantage from a military as
well as a commercial standpoint over
other European nations in the Far
East. Yet, I doubt if she could make
the trade without running the risk of
serious European complications. Great
Britain is not the nation to initiate a
movement which would bring about
such a result."

CALIFORNIA BOYS
BEAT THE REBELS
ON NEGROS ISLAND
Governor Smith Sends Four Com
panies Under Duboce and Sime,
Who Do the Trick.
MANILA, April 6.â Colonel Smith,
the Governor of the Island of Negros,
reports that a number of bandits head
ed by a man named Papaissio, attempt
ed a rebellion March 27, and killed
several officials of Jumaamaylan.
He also captured other officials and
issued a proclamation calling upon the
natives to rise and exterminate the
Americans and Spaniards.
Major Sime and two companies of
the California regiment were dis
patched by water to the scene of the
disturbance, and Colonel Duboce and
two other companies of troops were
sent overland.
On April 2 this force marched twelve
miles and captured Labzid, the head
quarters of the bandits, and destroyed
the town.
The troops also captured thirty-five
prisoners and scattered Papaissio's
forces, thus effectually quelling the re
bellion at the outset.
There has been a week's respite in
hostilities, chiefly in order to allow the
Filipinos to digest the proclamation of
the United States Commission. The
rebels remain remarkably quiet.
The sharpshooters of General Law
ton's line have borrowed the Filipino
tactics and are harassing the rebels
at night, picking off some of them
nightly.
Malolos is assuming its natural as
pect, but preparations are being made
to establish a permanent camp for the
troops there and the soldiers are clean
ing the city.
A third of the American force at
Malolos is sent nightly to form an ad
vanced line a mile north of the city,
with patrols and sentries ahead of the
line.
General Mac Arthur's volunteers are
receiving Krag-Jorgensen rifles, the
Filipinos having discovered that they
could effectively fire their Mausers and
retreat before the Americans approach
ed near enough to use their Spring
fields with effect.
'Advices received here from Samar, an
island forming a province of the Phil
ippines, say the revolutionists there are

RIOS REPORTS ON
SPANISH PRISONERS
Impossible to Secure Their Release
During the War Between Ameri
cans and Tagallos.
MADRID, April 7.â General Rios,
Spain's chief commander in the Philip
pines, cables that it is hopeless to ex
pect the liberation of the Spanish pris
oners while the war between the
Americans and the Tagallos continues.
. It is hoped here that when diplomatic
relations are resumed between Madrid
and Washington' on the ratification of
the peace treaty the question of the
prisoners in the hands of the Filipinos
will assume a more favorable phase.
LONDON, April 7.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Times says: The
Government has received a dispatch
from General Rios announcing the re
turn to Manila of tin? commission that
went to secure the liberation of the
Spanish prisoners in the hands of the
Filipinos. The commissioners report
that the prisoners are well treated, but
are scattered all over the, country, so
that Aguinaldo himself is ignorant of
their number and location. General
Rios says the Tagallos require a ran
som for some, but are ready to liberate
many out of friendship. Not a few of
the Spanish prisoners are now living
with the rebels.
THE TAGALLOS MUST
BE EXTERMINATED
An Observer Says That the War
Can Be Ended in No Other
Way.
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
MANILA. March 4.â Among' the uncer
tainties attendant upon the war now go
ing on here is the number of arms which
the rebels possess. That they are being
supplied at frequent intervals from some
unknown source scarcely admits of a
doubt; but in what quantities cannot even
be conjectured. Until a few days ago
there was every indication that the rebels
along our whole front were using home
made ammunition, but now smokeless
powder is again being used, and judging
from the enormous quantity of ammuni
tion expended every twenty-four hours
their supply must be unlimited. At every
village captured so far thousands of
rounds of Mauser cartridges have been
seized, but still there is no appreciable
difference in the amount expended from
day to day.
After the battle of Caloocan, when the
American line was so long and thin that
any further general advance became in
expedient, the rebels made a discovery
which revolutionized their plans and in
spired them with renewed courage. This
was that their rifles had a superior range
to those of the majority of American
weapons. Thereafter their sharpshooters
carefully remained out of range of the
Springfield? carried by the volunteer regi
ments in front of them, but maintained
a constant ahd more or less effective fire
from trees, clumps of bamboo, rocks or
other natural points of vantage, both by
day and night. A more galling situation
. than that in which the American troops2
were placed it would be difficult to imag
ine. Constantly potted at by an unseen
foe, yet unable to silence bis lire except
upon such rare occasions as when the
country was ordered cleared, and then
compelled to retire to their original lines
after having done it. the wonder Is that
the men were kept in check at all.
It must also be remembered that hith
erto the army has been acting in conjunc
tion with the navy, and that LVwey's
ships have very materially assisted In
routing the enemy along the shores of
Manila Bay. while there is a disposition
on the part of many soldiers to belittle
the work done by the other branch of the
service, there can be no Question as to
the effect of the Monadnock's and
Charleston's shells upon the rebel
trenches both at Malftte and Caloocan.
This factor can no longer be counted upon
once the army advances from the coast,
and the rebels re fully alive to that fact.
Unless all signs fall the enemy
may be expected to make a better show
ing" from this time on. In which event
thoso who imagine that the campaign
will b* a walkover for the invaders will
probably tlnd that they underestimated
the native valor.
If their foolhardy and fanatical lead
ers would only see that there can be but
one ontooma to a struggle with such a
nation as the United States all would be
be woll. but. unfortunately for the Ta
gnllos. they deliberately shut their eyes
to the truth and those who know them j
say that nothing short of extermination ;
will Insure peace In the Philippines. In
tome respects, perhaps, this would be a
good thing for the other millions who in- i
habit the archipelago, inhuman though ;
the very suggestion may seem. That they
are the sol instigators of the rebellion :
there can be no doubt and their methods
show that the Instinct of the savage still ;
predominates. For instance, spite their
boasted intelligence and humanitarian
the Tagallos have frequently boon seen
to drive their scared allies Into half-con
structed earthworks at the points of their
bayonets, knowing full well that they
would be shelled out again by the Ameri
can artillery immediately. Again, ono of
their favorite means or decoying their |
foes into the open is thai of - ring a
white flag. Worse still, they have been i
guilty, repeatedly, of the barbarism of j
shooting volleys at hospital ambulances.
both in the o"pen and while returning
from the front. Mutilation of the ene
my's dead is an evidence of their boasted
civilization. If our troops retire for strat
egic movements it is a glorious victory,
hailed all over the country, and, accord
ing to the story relatod by the natives,
more Americans are being killed every
day than have yet been landed on the
islands. In the 'matter of exaggerating
the enemy's loss, however, they are not
alone, for our own troops are very prone
to fall into the same error. In fact, to
hear the men relating the execution they
had done during the day at supper time
one might be led to believe the country !
was strewn with dead Filipinos. Yet,
with the exception of the two big fights, ;
the largest number of killed in one day
has been 113. most of whom were mown
down by the gatlings on the river gun- ;
boat Laguna de Bai, near San Pedro Ma
cate. As a matter of fnct. in nir.e cases
out of ten. when brushes occurred, our ',
own men have no opportunity to hunt for :
the enemy's dead, and the loss is purely
a matter of conjecture.
HULDA JOHNSON'S
SHOCKING DEATH
THE FACTS BEING LAID BEFORE
A JURY.
Big Damage Suit Against the Market
Street Railway Company Now
on Trial Before Judge
Daingerfield.
The circumstances of the death of little
Hulda Johnson, who was crushed beneath
the wheels of a Mission street car be
tween Fifth and Sixth streets on January
20, IS9S. are being: explained to a jury in
Judge Paingerf.eld's court. William John
son, father of the unfortunate child, is
suing the Market Street Railway Com
pany to recover SCO.OOO damages.
When the case went to trial all wit
ness* i were barred from the room, and
after a short time the jury was secured.
Those who were accepted to try the case
are: August Gergus. Joseph Cadenasso,
P. H. Engelbut, A. Hub*r, Herman Heit
mann. Richard A. Bourne, M. J. Hogan,
Adolph Asher. N. Ferroggiaro, Ens. L.
[berg. D. R. A very and Samuel J.
Mitchell.
Mrs. Johnson was the first witness
called. She testified that on the day her
little daughter met her death she and her
husband were busy making shot pockets
to be used at the lecal shot tower. She
noticed her daughter playing in the yard
and continued her work. A short time
afterward her little son came running into
the yard and told her that Hulda had been
kiiled. Mr. Johnson ran from the house
and found that indeed the little boy had
told the truth.
Elizabeth McLaughlin, who was en the
car when the accident occurred, had but
little chance to tell her story. From her
the plaintiff endeavored to establish the
speed of the car that crushed the child,
but this counsel for the defendant headed
off on the grour.d that the witness had
failed to establish the contention that she
was competent to testify as to the speed
of the car, she not .being an expert on
speed. An effort was ma . for some time
to get this information before the jury
from the lips of the witness, but without
success. TiÂ»e persistence of plaintiff's
counsel, however, doubt", had its ef
fect on the jury, as it was easy to tell
that if the rules of evidence had permit
ted the witness would have sworn that
the car was greatly exceeding the speed
allowed by law. Another matter the plain
tiff seeks to establish is that the car had
no fender, contrary to the law.
Theodore Dlerks, an undertaker, whose
place of business is near the scene of tht
accident, testified that be saw the child
in th* center of the track when the car
was some 150 feet away. Later he looked
up ar.d saw the car strike the child and
end her life. Frank Highey and Julia F.
Knott werj called in turn and gave tes
timony along the same line, after which
the case went over until this mornlr.g.
BURGLARY HIS PASTIME.
Jo v McGregor, who was discharged
last November from the Utah Field Bat
tery while in this city, has been making
an unenviable record for himself since
then. Three times he was arrested and
was released Wednesday after serving a
three months' sentence for having burg
lar's tools In his possession.
Wednesday night he broke into the
room of Lee Win;. S43Vs Washington
street, and was caught in the act by Po
licemen Collins and Burke. He struck
Collins a vicious blow and tried to escape,
but a tap on the head from Collins' club
brought him to his senses and he was
soon handcuffed by the two officers. He
had broken open the door of the room
and had also forced open a closet where
the Chinese kept his valuables. In his
pockets were found several clocks and
articles of jewelry.
McGregor fared before Judge Mo
ran yesterday to answer a charge of
burglary, and the case was continued till
to-morrow.

EVIDENCE AS TO
EMBALMED BEEF
Armour â¢& Go. Write of Tkeir pro

Manipulated.
WASHINGTON. April B.â ln the army
Beef Court of Inquiry to-day the letter
of Messrs. Armour & Co., proposing to
use the Powell process for the preserva
tion of beef was submitted as evidence
by Major Lee, acting for General Miles.
It was addressed to the commissary gen
era!, dated at the firm's Washington ot
fice, July 13, 1896, and read as follows:
"As supplementary and explanatory of
our bid to supply dressed beef In Cuba
we wish to say that we have the exclu
sive control of the Powell process for pre
serving fresh meats, and that this pro.
cess has been tested at Tampa, Fla., the
test having been completed with most
satisfactory results. This test was made
under the supervision of Colonel John
Weston Of your department, who had ad
vised you of the results. We are advised.
however, that he received four cases of
beef which we sent from Chicago, duly
refrigerated and treated according to the
Powell process. Part of these carcasses
were enveloped in sacks or canvas and
part were not. The carcasses were dis
tributed to the Third Cavalry, the Sixth
Cavalry, batteries of artillery and the
medical department, and were hung In
the air on the upper deck of the trans
port troopships lying at the wharf in the
hot sun, without any benefit of the fresh
air or movement of the ships. The pieces
that were not wrapped fermented in less
than seventy-two hours, while the pieces
that were covered or wrapped kept about
100 hours.
"These practical tests, made under the
supervision of your own officer, show that
by means of this process wrapped pieces
or carcasses can be kept longer than the
seventy-two hours required by your spe
cifications. We believe we may safely
say that such results have never before
been accomplished in the history of the
fresh meat business, In view of the
tests which we have made in the past
and of the results of the tests made un
der the supervision or your own office
we believe that we are absolutely safe
in the assertion that this is the only pro
cess or method which will secure the re
sults required by your specifications.
Very truly yours, ARMOUR & CO.

by Captain 1.-u^heed. It Is as follows-

THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 7, 1899.
that It was complete. It was then that men
whom he understood to be representatives of
Swift & Co. brought up the question as to the
length of time the beef should keep after Issue.
A memorandum for changes containing the 24
--hour clause mi brought to him by Captain
Davis, assistant commissary general. Details
were lacking and the suggestions as to time
seemed to be conflicting. He had tried to get
details from Captain Davis In regard to the
24-hour clause and was told by him that the
understanding- was that the refrigerators were
to be built on shore and in the rear of the
moving troops, thi tlon being 1 tve the
beef exposed for the minimum time cnljr. V
had at th* time pointed out the appari
between the 14 and the 72-hour
In one other provision General I
Interlined In his own handwriting a iliti?-. v
ferrtng to the time, reading as follows: "V
shall not be more than seventy-two hours from
the time oi storing the Eiune In such refrig
erators."
This clause, Mr. de Calr.drey Bald, he had
Dot at the time understood, but he had no !
authority to strike it out. When the twenty
four-hour clause was inserted General Eagan
appeared dubious about it, but said nothing
more. Mr. de Caindrey said that he had been
Â«n worried by the apparent Inconsistencies in
the contract that he had kept all the memor
anda relating to the matter.
"Are they on file now?" asked Major Lee.
"They are not in the file boxes."
The witness then stated In reply to questions
â¢hat Captain Davis waa In charge of these i
box*?, and that Captain Davis was the especial |
confidant of General Eagan. Asked if he had
had any reason at the time the contract was j
â Irawn to suspect that any of the data had been i
withheld by Kr\Enn or Pavis, Mr. de Caindrey
replied th.-v he hfid no su'h suspicion then, and
that he had none now. Hia impr. -ssi in was that
they wera undertaking to do something which
they had not digested sufficiently to know just j
how they wanted to do it.
Mr. de Calndfey gave some of the particulars â 
. Ing the trial of the Powell process In |
Florida. He spoke of a letter of Arm.mr A Co.
In which they argued that they should be i
â¢ i the contract because they controlled I
this Powell procesÃ,*notwUhstanding thru their \
hid was something higher than th.it ol Swift
A- Co.
"What became of that letter?" asked Major
Lee. :
"A portion of it is In the files." said Mr. de
Caindrey. '-but the bulk of it was returned to
the writer at his request. The portion re
tained was the last page, containing the in
dorsement of the Secretary of War and the
Commissary General."
Witness was then requested to and did read
the letter from Armour & Co., dated July 13.
bearing en this subject, but he said he had no
remembrance of ever having seen the letter be
fore. This letter wag then put In as evidence.
At this point Major Lee asked Mr. de Cain
drey whether he had ever tendered his resigna
tion as an otneial of the War Depart]
and the witness replied that he had done so.
"i tendered my resignation on the day follow
ing General Eacan'B appearance before the
War Commission." he said.
Major Lee was about to proceed with this
line of questions when Colonel Davis objected
On the ground that the inquiries were not
pertinent. Major Lee then desisted, withdraw
ing the first question. â¢
Dr. Richard A. Pyl<\ chief surgeon of the
District of Columbia volunteers, testified that
the refrigerator beef supplied the troops In
Tuba had given them dysentery, but expressed
the opinion that this was due to the fact that
they ate too much of it. He expressed dis
approval of tHe canned beef and paid the men

PROTECTING A GIRL.
The Case of Josephine Naper From

:Â«'.; street, pending developments.
The g!rl and August Beblln, a man
about GO years of age. were on the train
from lehama County Wednesday and
tr.t-:r actions aroused the suspicions of a
railroad detective, who kept his eye on
them till they reached this city. Then he
notified Policeman Dowd. and the girl and
Reblin wt-re taken to the Harbor r
Station and later to police headquarters
Reblin was questioned and said that the
girl's father was a section foreman 'it
Tefcama and he had sent the girl to this
city In his care, an she was to go to the
home of Reblin's brother. A dispatch was
sent to the girl's father and he rers'icd
that Reblin was to take the girl to her
uncle's house. As there was a discrep
ancy between the dispatch and Reblin s
statement, the Young "Women's Associa
tion was notified . and Mrs. E. \Y i
took the girl to the home. A letter
been sent to the girl's father :iski

Only Those Who Have Never Had a

Governments.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, "Wellington Hotel,
Washington, April 6.
Herr Solf, who is to succeed Dr,
Raffel as president of the Municipal
il of Apia, has left "Washington
fur his post He intends to stop in
Chicago for a day or two and also at
Colorado Springs, Colo., planning his
movements so as to be able to take
the steamer at San Francisco some time
between the 10th and loth of next
month.
The State Department has not yet
selected its representative on the Sa
moan commission, but the President is
Hiving the matter his personal atten
tion. Nearly every American who has
had anything to do with Samoa in a
representative capacity in recent years
has turned, up as an applicant for this j
place. But the State Department does j
not feel disposed to choose from among >
them, principally for the reason that it i
is deemed proper to name some person
who has not been involved in any man
ner in the past difficulties on the is
lands. If there is any intention of se
curing an amicable agreement between
the three powers interested in Samoan
affairs it is believed that some such
policy as this is essential.
Therefore the Berlin intimation in
some >>f the press dispatches that Herr j
Schmidt had been selected as the Ger
man Commissioner does not meet with
credence here, for it is well known that
while he was at Apia, first as Vice Con
sul and afterward as president of the :
Municipal Council, Herr Schmidt by j
his uncompromising championship of
the German interests where they con
flicted with those of Americans, became
involved with our Consul, Mr. Mulligan,
to a degree which ltd to the retirement
of both of these officials. If it is
ed essential that the commission- :
ere shouid be experienced in Samoan
affaire, however, that fact will un
doubtedly color the selection of an
American representative by the Presi
dent.
It is possible that there may be a ,
misapprehension regarding the German
Commissioners owing to the large num
ber of Schmidts in the consular office,
one report ne-ing that it 1b Herr
Schmidt, Consui at Caracas.
The German Embassador, Dr. yon
Holleben, called at the State Depart
ment to-day to felicitate Secretary Hay
on the satisfactory adjustment of the
Samoan affair- Even as late as yester
day afternoon the last possibilities of
a hitch had not disappeared, but late
in the day official dispatches were re
ceived from Berlin stating that as a
result of conferences between the Ger
man. British and American represen
tatives a settlement was assured.
The main feature of this conference
was in a determination that the high
commission would act by unanimous
vote and not through a majority. This
the theory that the delegates will
be of high character, that unanimous
agreement will be certain, although
Is, of course, the possibility of a
deadlock. The present tendency is not
to provide a final arbitrator, but to as
sume that the commission will agree
am.ing themselves. This eliminates for
the present King Oscar of Sweden, who
has been mentioned for umpire. The
German Embassador and members of
his staff also made a call to-day at the
British Embassy, thus further evidenc
ing the agreeable relations which have
suddenly taken the place of rather
strained conditions heretofore prevail
ing in Samoa.
REMOVES FURNITURE"
IN DEAD OF NIGHT
Mrs. Spring Strips Her San Jose
Home and Her Husband Wants
to Stop Alimony.
BAN JOSE. April 6.â Mrs. Emily Spring.
who pending the outcome of a divorce
iuit against her husband, H. M. N.
Spring, is residing at Belvedere, returned
a few days ago and removed all the car
furnlf.ire and pictures from their
handsome home at Seventh and San An
tonio streets. She secured half a
dozen drays and a force of men, and in
the dead of night carted away the goods.
When Spring visited the placo the next
day it was bare. The furniture, which is
valued at several thousand dollars, was
traced to San Francisco and then to Bel
vedere, where Mrs. Spring has furnished
a cottage she has taken for the summer.
To-day Spring filed an affidavit asking
that his wife be cited to appear and show
cause why she should not be deprived of
her $200 per month alimony because Of her
removal of furniture and children from
the county. The divorce case promises to
b* interesting because of the prominence
ot both parties.
NEILSON TALKED TOO MUCH.
Therefore He Cannot Serve on the
Murdock Jury.
WILLOWS. April When the Mur
dock case was called this morning the
courtroom was crowded, anticipating the
trial of Juror Neilson as to his state
ments made concerning the case at bar.
Neilson is a money lender and note
scalper, and It was on account of his
prominence that so much interest was
evinced. Nellson. during a severe exam
ination by Attorney Freeman, protested
that he had at no time expressed an opin
ion as to this case and denied that he hud
talked about it.
Ii Â«,ts proved by two reputable wit
nesses this morning that he had not only
discussed the case, but had done so frc-
DUÂ«.tly in a decided and emphatic man
ner. Mr. Neilson was excused, much to
hi-? discomfiture, and his efforts to be a
member of the Murdock jury went for
navght.

GEN. GOMEZ MAY
BE REINSTATED
Likely to Again Control
Cuban Warriors.
NOW POSES AS A PATRIOT
AND BESUMES THE OLD CRY
FOR INDEPENDENCE.
Agitation That May Be Harmful to
Industrial Conditions and Cause
Trouble for the United
States.
Special Disratch to The Call.
HAVANA, April 6.â The Cuban Mili
tary Assembly being dead General
Maximo Gomez will take up his pro
gramme of solidifying the Cuban peo
ple, but without ceasing to urge the
United States to withdraw from the Is
land. His purpose is to make the peo
ple seem to have but one emotion, one
desireâ the thought of independence
and the absolute separation from the
United States.
General Gomez considers the dissolu
tion of the Assembly as his personal
achievement, aided by the military ad
ministration here and countenanced at
Washington. He believes he emerges
from the controversy with the Assem
bly stronger than ever with the better
classes. His theory is that the Cubans,
who before thought him merely an ad
roit guerrilla chief, are now preparing
to regard him as a political leader, and
that a few days more probably will see
him in name general-in-chief of the
army.
Yesterday the Cuban genera!. Pedro
Diaz, who commands in the province
of Pinar del Itio, invited several gen
erals who are friendly to Gomez to a
conference regarding 1 the latter's future
course. As many who were invited were
some distance away, however, and
could not reach here In time for the
meeting, there were only a few actually
present; but the pcssibility of reinstat
ing Gomez as commander-in-chief was
informally discussed, with the result
that little or no opposition to the propo
sition developed.
In order to get a more general ex
pression of opinion it was decided to
defer the formal meeting until to-mor
row morning. No other candidate is
possible, and if any such action is at
tempted it will undoubtedly be carried
through.
General Gomez, if reinstated, would
be of great service to the T'nited States
in the disbursement of the 53,000,000, but
his political programme means the
keeping up of agitation and disturbance
in the minds of the people and the
weakening of American authority by
producing the impression that every
thing done by the Americans is tempo
rary and may sooner or later be over
turned.
American observers consider any such
agitation as extremely harmful to the
industrial revival and the restoration
of Cuban credit. Some who are high in
authority and who have exceptional op
portunities of knowing the character
and ideas' of CJomez think the United
States Government may have, trouble
with him yet. His attitude has always
been consistent regarding independence
for Cuba and he is still working for the
same end. ,
WATER CONTROVERSY
LEFT TO ARBITRATORS
Stephen M. White Makes the Closing
Argument for the Los Angeles
Corporation.
LOS ANGELES, April 6.â The long
drawn-out litigation between the city and
the wtaer company before the Board of
Water Arbitrators came to a conclusion
this morning, when Stephen M. White
closed the arguments for the water com
pany. This question was once the sub
ject" for special political planks, each of
the parties vying in rhetoric to make
their positions unquestionably clear, still
at the cession of the board to-day, the
most momentous in the history of the
contest, aside from brokers, capitalists
and a few Councilmen. but ten plain citi
zens were onlookers, and they peered over
the balcony of the gallery in the Council
chamber. White argued that the city
should pay for the water company's plant
on a basis of "value" and not of "cost."
Its value, as the company's contention
has always been, should he based on its
earning capacity as a utility. He quoted
from the now famous thirty-year contract
to show that it says the city shall pay
the value of improvements. Improvements
mean what has been added to the plant,
and according to his reasoning the valne
of the property to the city should be
based on its present ability to make rev
enue.
At the conclusion of White's address
the attorneys on both sid^s thanked the
arbitrators, to which Chairman Mendell
briefly replied. It was agreed that when
the board shall be ready to announce a
verdict notice will be given for the wind
up. The whole matter rests now with the
three arbitrators to determine how much
the city of Los Angeles shall pay for the
plant of the Los Angeles City Water Com
pany.

Interesting Proclamation Issued by
China's Dowager Empress.
WASHINGTON, April 6.â United States
Minister Conger at Peking has supplied
the State Department with a copy of the
proclamation posted at Tientsin relative
to the treatment of missionaries in China.
In this edict, issued on "27th of tenth
moon," the Empress Dowager rerites the
fact that anti-Christian movements had
taken place In many provinces, and de
clares that these have all been based on a
false sentiment. Bha wishes the people
to understand that the teaching of Chris
tianity i? permitted in China and that
the preachers are to be treated as good
citizens. The Empress Dowager declares
that a good man, whether Christian or
not, will obey the principles of beint* hon
est and true to others, wherefore she de
sires her people to treat foreigners as
their own countrymen and avoid all mis
understanding with them. She commands
the viceroys and cmrials in the prov-nces
to emphasize her sincerity by exertine
themselves to suppress all ap
among the people before anti-Christian
prejudice is displayed.

GRANT REMAINS
AS A CANDIDATE
Yet After the Senatorial
Toga.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 6.â The definite
announcement was made to-day by
James V. Kelley if Governor Gage calls
an extra session of the Legislature to
elect a United States Senator, U. S.
Grant will again be a candidate.
"Why should Mr. Grant not be again
a factor in the contest?" asked Kelley,
during an interview. "He was always
in the lead during the balloting in Sac
ramento and quit that fight with as
many votes as any ene else."
Owing to the relations existing be
tween Grant and Kelley during and
prior to the recent legislative contest,
this announcement is taken as official,
and has renewed interest in political
circles. Kelley admitted that, in view
of the many well-recognized contingen
cies and in view of his announcement
that Grant is still a candidate, a call
for an extra session is not probable.
Kelley insists, however, that if no ses
sion is called Grant's friends will rally
to his support next session in a deter
mined effort to make the Legislature
of 1901 Republican, when Grant's name
will be presented as a successor to
Stephen M. White.
It was whispered to-day that several
of Grant's campaign leaders had ar
ranged to hold a meeting in Los An
geles to map out plans for keeping
the present Grant organization alive.
This organization is to be used as a
nucleus for opposition to the present
Burns-McLaughlin Republican State
machine.
Walter Bacon insists that he knows
nothing of such a meeting. "I have
just received a letter from Grant," said
Bacon. "It is the third since the end
nf the Sacramento campaign, and poli
tics is not referred to in any way. I
doubt if Grant knows himself what his
future political plans are. One thing
is certain: Though Grant may nut be
able to force public opinion to indorse
his Senatorial candidacy one year from
now. I am positive Colonel Burns will
never be able to bring such a result
about for himself. That being the case,
I am convinced Governor Gage wilL
never convene the present Legislature
in extra session."
The assertion is positively made from
a reliable source that should Grant
make another effort to secure the Sena
torial toga Milton J. Green will not be
the captain general in command of the
Grant forces. James P. Brown of San
Francisco will succeed Green, who is
to be retained as one of the many sub
lieutenants.
This same authority says that the
last campaign cost Grant not quite
$65,000. Milton Green's vouchers are
now being overhauled by Grant. Of
the sum expended United States Sena
tor Elkins of West Virginia and Rich
ard Kerens c-f Missouri advanced cer
tain fund?. Mrs. U. B. Grant Sr. and
certain Santa Fe interests were also
represented in the contribution?. It is
stated that the Santa Fe money did
not come from the local funds of the
company or from any of its agents, but
from the personal fortune of a large
stockholder who had known General
Grant intimately.
WESTERN TERMINAL OF
SANTA FE SYSTEM
Stockton Will Celebrate the Arrival
There in July of the New Trans

STOCKTON. April >>.-For a time at
least it appears that Stockton will be the
western terminal of the Santa Fe system,
and as near as can be ascertained Santa
Fe trains may bo expected to reach here
the first week of July. Citizens do not
propose to allow this great event marking
the inauguration of a transcontinental
and competing line to pass without recog
nition. At the n^xt meeting of th<
chants' Association steps will be taken
to prepare for the event. If possible It is
proposed to make the Fourth of July and
the railroad event or.c celebration and in
vite the people from all the surrounding
counties to participate.
Two men. alleged to be representatives
of the Santa Fe. were in the city yester
day. To real estate agents with whom
they had conferences they insisted that
their negotiations be kept quiet. They are
known to have looked at several lots at
the foot of Weber avenue and some prop
erty in the vicinity of Sacramento stri-et
somewhere near the Southern Pacific de
pot. The agents did not wish to let it be
known that they were in town and that
they talked of real estate, and they left
as suddenly as they came.

SECTION HANDS

Promise of the Southern Pacific Hav

the Shasta Route.
REDDING. April 6.â The section crews
along the mountain division of the Shasta
route are being replaced with little diffi
flculty, though it is anticipated that the
Southern Pacific Company will ha\e a
lot of trouble in trying to keep the men
at $1 28 a day for five days a week. The
old crews quit to a man and are seeking
other employment.
A new crew has been put on at P.ed
dingr. but it is believed that none of ihem
will stay very long. Twenty men from
the lower country wer* 5 *ent up the line
yesterday for the various sections be
tween here and Dunsmuir. Others are
expected to follow shortly.
Work in the pineries will soon be In
full blast, and it will be difficult to keep
men on the sections at the reduced wages
the railroad company offers. It is con
tended by the old section crews that the
company will be forced to raise the scale
of wages before the first of May. or de
pend upon an uncertain class of labor in
its track repair department.

the lone cabin where the murderer
is believed to have slept for several
nights.
Late this afternoon Deputy McCol
lough wired Sheriff Getchell that his
posse had searched the neighboring
mountains thoroughly and had failed
completely to track the fugitive further
than Van Appen's Hollow. Like the
â waning colors of a fading rainbow the
trail that promised to lead the authori- |
ties close on the heels of the fleeing fu
gitive dwindled away and was lost in
the tangled underbrush of chaparral
and manzanita. Had the posse cornered
the desperado in Van Appen's Hollow
he would have had a better fighting,
chance for his life than in any refuge
In this vicinity. Once ambushed behind
the gnarled, projecting rocks at the
back of the abandoned cabin a des

unquestioned courage could fortify him
self against a regiment of soldiers, a
score of expert trailers scoured the lo- j
cality about Van Appei a Hollow yes- |

any additional traces of the furtive.
About th fireplace where the fugitive
is supposed to have cooked his meal

on a pine board box and close to the
embers of the lire they found a bunch
of matches The isolated spot was an
ideal retreat for a man in Moore's des

it opened to the fugitive an exit into
a country where he would be tempo

have journeyed from there across Lone

general impression here to-night that
the murderer embraced this oppor- ,
tunity of eluding the manhunters who
are on his trail and is by this time well
into the heart of Yuba County,
Moore could have made his way
aWig the Marysville road to the New
town road, thence along the Excelsior
ditch into the country about Wheat

accustomed to making long journeys
Bfoot he could easily have covered this
distance from the time he was seen in ;

Collough and his posse over at San

him to leave there.

IS RECOVERED
One of the Victims of
the Chilkat.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EUREKA, April 6.â Surfmen Erlck
son and Swanson of the life saving sta
tion, while patrolling the beach last
night, found the body of Alfred Soy
land, one of the seamen of the Chilkat.
It was partly buried in the sand and
there were numerous cuts on the head
and face. The body was attired only
in underclothing and socks.
At the inquest to-day First Officer
Johnson of the Chilkat testified as fol
lows:
"We left the railroad wharf at about
10:15 a. m., Tuesday, April 4, 1839. We
steamed along down the bay to the Jet
ties. The North Fork went over the
bar a little ahead of us. The first
breaker that struck us stove in the
pilothouse and carried away the steer
ing gear. I ordered relieving tackle put
on the tiller. By the time the tackles
were put on she had no headway and
the went broadside to the sea.
"Then we got two or three breakers
which broke her all to pieces. The cap
tain ordered the life preservers on all
those aboard. There were plenty of life
preservers, but all of those aboard did
not put them on. We then launched
one boat which the engineer, assistant
engineer, a fireman, steward, a sailor
and one passenger, in all six, got into
and pulled out over the bar to the
steamer North Fork. We then launched
another boat in which myself, the sec
ond mate, cook, a fireman and one pas
senger got into, and then we pulled
around the wreck and picKed up an
other passenger. Then we got a breaker
and capsized. When we came up we
fuund v raft and climbed onto it. We
then p>t several more breakers and
turned over several times, and finally
lost the raft. We then got scattered
about. We caught hold of a floating
piece of timber whenever we could and
at last myself and two others reached
the beach.
"I saw the captain balling out his
boat when it upset, and he was thrown
into the water, and I saw him" climb
upon some wreckage, and I saw an
other sailor sitting with him. We then
got several breakers again in succes
sion and that was the last I saw of
him. I have viewed the body of the de
ceased and know him to be Alford Soy
land, a sailor on the Chilkiit. His age
was about 21 years, and ho was born
in Norway and was a single man. He
haa been on the Chilkat three times,
about forty days the last time. The
men at the wheel were not hurt."
At low tide the Chilkat is fully ex
posed, keel up, bottom not broken and
propeller intact. She will be sold at
auction by the underwriters.
This afternoon the life saving crew
went out and made a thorough search
for more bodies in the bight where
Soyland was found, but with no suc
cess.
W. C. Morser, one of the rescued pns
sengers, is on the Pomona, to arrive
at San Francisco to-morrow morning.

forts to capture his brother's slayer,
Joe Kilroy sent to-day for the chief of
a band of Indians living in the woods
near here in the hope that he could in
duce some of the band, who are famous
trailers, to take up the scent at San
Juan. Kilroy pointed out the fact that
the Indians could secure the reward
for bringing in the fugitive dead or
alive, but the big chief fought shy of
the proposition.
"Ugh, Indian go over to You Bet to
prospect soon; no can hunt Moore,"
said the copper-colored chief in tones
of disgust.
"Why. you can make more money in
a day by bringing Moore in than you
could if you prospected for a whole
year," said Kilroy assuringly.
"Can't do," retorted the big chief, and
with an imperious stride he journeyed
back to his people.
Sheriff Getchell, when seen by a Call
correspondent to-night, said he did not
intend to give up the search. "I have
good reason to believe that the fugitive
is making his way south in the direc
tion where he was seen by Rancher
Nettleship. I have placed experienced
men in that portion of the county and
it would not surprise me a bit if Moore
was captured while attempting to leave
the county that way."
When asked to express an opinion as
to whether Moore had left the county
Sheriff Getchell said: "Well, I am in
no position to make a statement in that
point. If he has succeeded in getting
out of the county I think he is making
his way south and in that case he will
run directly into the arms of Captain
Nihell's posse."
KNOCKS OUT HIS
FORMER ASSAILANT
Attorney Fairall Fells
Thomas Fitch Jr.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, April 6.â A sensational
encounter took place last evening on
San Joaquin street between Attorney
C. H. Fairall and Thomas Fitch Jr.,
son and namesake of his eloquent
father. Attorney Fairall *has but one
hand. This misfortune Is due to pistol
wounds inflicted by Fitch last summer,
when he emptied a revolver at the un
armed lawyer on a public thorough
fare. But with this remaining hand of
his strong right arm Fairall turned on
Fitch last evening and delivered a pow
erful blow square in the face of his for
mer assailant, sending him upon his
back In the gutter.
The lawyer walked calmly away, and
was soon engaged in a conversation
with a friend a short distance from
where he had left tne object of his
wrath. The trouble arose between the
two when Fairall became the attorney
for Mrs. Fitch in her suit for divorce.
The defendant claimed that the law
yer had been interested in his affairs
in more than a professional capacity.
All of the interested parties were at
the time guests of the Budd House.
Fitch was known to be possessed of a
vivid imagination and an u/igovernable
temper, and his avowals of vengeance
were .shown to be more than mere rav
ings when he attempted to shoot down
Fairall. As it was the lawyer lost his
left hand.
Some sympathy was felt for Fitch, as
many thought he had worked his mind
into such a state that he was not ac
countable for his attempt at murder.
He got off with a fine. Since then he
has been around town, seemingly as
a man of leisure. Fairall naturally
met or passed him frequently. The at
torney, says it has been Fitch's custom
to glare at him as the two approached,
and when nearly opposite to glance at
his empty sleeve and then give a sar
castic leer. The lawyer said human
nature could not stand the continued
insults delivered by unmistakable in
sinuation and manner and in cruel
malice. Last evening the worm turned
and Fitch went down.
The trouble is now reopened, and
there are many who predict a tragedy.
Fitch has lost much of the former sym
pathy shown him, and Fairall is evi
dently of the opinion that patience has
ceased to be a virtue. Fitch applied
for a warrant for Fairall's arrest, but
it was refused him, pending a further
investigation of the encounter by the
Prosecuting Attorney.
STEPHEN CASTRO
GIVEN A DRUBBING
SALINAS, April 6.â Another chapter in
the aftermath of the breaking up of the
Mafia nine which made itself notorious re
cently in Castrovllle by terrorizing the
whole community by bold robberies
and assaults was brought to light to-day
in that place. James Douglass, the hus
| band of the woman who was attacked at
I her own home on the night of March 2,
! clubbed into insensibility and dragged
! some distance and hidden in a brush pile
and supposedly left for dead, met Stephen
Castro, b wdl-known citizen of that place.
on tli<- public street this morning and
gave liim ;t severe drubbing. He clubbed
ro on the head with a pistol and
would have probably used it otherwise
had he not been prevented by a crowd of
j citizens that assembled when the encoun
ter occurred. Castro has had Douglass
arrested, and from assertions made by
I eye-witnesses as well as others who pro
fess to be cognizant of the affair this
late trouble will cause further develop
ments in the Mafia gang.

WASHINGTON, April 6.â The Secre
tary of State has announced the consti
tution of the United States delegation
to the disarmament congress, which will
meet at The Hague in the latter part
of May.
The delegation consists of Andrew D.
White, United States Embassador at
Berlin; Mr. Newell, United States Min
ister to the Netherlands; Professor Low
of the Columbia University, New York;
Captain Crozier, Ordnance Depart
ment, United States army, and Cap
tain A. T. Mahan, retired, United States
navy.
Frederick Holls of New York will be
secretary of the delegation.
The American commission, as a
whole, is regarded as an exceptionally
strong body, being made up of men well
known not only in public and political
life but in the world of letters and in
ternational affairs. They are all men
of scholarship, fine linguists and those
attainments helpful In a congress rep
resenting the nations of the world, con
ducted under the diplomatic usage
which makes French the accepted lan
guage.
Mr. White is best known In the fields
of education and diplomacy. After
graduating at Yale, class of '53, he went
to Europe for several years of historic
study, mainly at Berlin and Paris. For
a time he was an attache of the United
States Legation at St. Petersburg. Re
turning to this country, he began his
university career as professor of Eng
lish literature at the University of
Michigan. Later he became the first
president of Cornell, his service con
j tlnuing from 1867 to 1885, when he re-
I tired through ill health. He was United
States Commissioner to San Domingo in
1871. From 1879 to 1881 he was Minister
to Germany, again taking this impor
tant post under President McKinley.
During the administration of Mr. Cleve
land Mr. White was chosen as one of
the Venezuelan commissioners at the
! time when the affair was at its most
i critical stage. He was also Minister to
; Russia in 1892.
Seth Low also is known as an edu
j cator as well as a man of public af
fairs. He was graduated from Colum
bia University, whose president he be
came in 1890, later giving $1,000,000 for
university buildings. He was Mayor of
Brooklyn in 1881 and again in 188;?, his
service being marked by numerous re
forms.
Stanford Newell was appointed Min
ister to the Netherlands from Minne
sota. His selection as one of the dele-
I gates was expected because he was
i Minister resident at The Hague, where
I the congress is to be held.
Captain William C. Crozier is one of
the most highly accomplished of the
officers of the ordnance corps, which is
generally recognized as containing the
very highest grade of talent in the
United States army.
No name is better known to students
of naval strategy than that of Captain
Alfred T. Mahan, sailor, strategist ar>d
author. Captain Mahan was born in
New York and appointed an active
midshipman in the United States navy
in September, 1856. He reached the
grade of lieutenant at the outbreak of
the civil war in 1861, became a com-
Kin 1871 and a captain on Sep
-13, 1883. He retired November
His last command was that
hicago, then on the European
and he retired upon his own
on in order to pursue the lit
erary work which has made him fam
ous. His most important contribution
to literature is "The Influence of Sea
Power Upon History."
HOBART WILL SOON
RETIRE FROM POLITICS
So "McKinley and Roosevelt" May
Head the Next National Re
publican Ticket.
WASHINGTON, April 6.â There is con
siderable anxiety in political circles con
cerning Vice President Hobart's health.
The impression obtains that he is in a
much more serious condition than has
been reported. Mr. Hobart's physician has
ordered him to take a vacation of at least
six months. It has not been decided
whether he will go to Europe or to Cali
fornia.
"I am satisfied," said one of Mr. Ho
bart's friends to-day, "that he will not be
a candidate for a second term as Vice
President next year. Mr. McKinley and
all his friends are anxious to have him
on the Presidential ticket again, but Mr.
Hobart's health will preclude his accept
ing the honor. He has led a very active
life and is completely broken down. It is
his Intention, I understand, to retire both
from politics and business as soon as pos
sible."
The withdrawal of Mr. Hohart from the
political arena will necessitate the selec
tion of a new running mate for Mr. Mc-
Kinley next year. It is said that Senator
Hanna had an idea that "McKinley and
Roosevelt" would make a strong combi
nation.
STRONG FORCE
TO CRUSH THE
ASSASSINS
Four Hundred Armed Men
Go to Battle With Louis
iana Desperadoes.
POSSES DRIVEN OFF
They Return for Reinforcements,
and a Battle Royal in the South
ern Swamps Expected.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW ORLEANS, April 6.â Four
hundred men armed with rifles, a large
portion of them mounted, are scouring
the parishes of Tangipahoa and Wash
ington in search of men who recently
assassinated Mr. Magee, of the Ban
ner Lumber Company, at Kentwood. in
Tangipahoa.
Magee's assassination is one of a
dozen that have occurred in the parish,
and it seems to have at last aroused
the law and order element.
Bloodhounds were obtained and the
trail of the assassins followed. Since
then the parish has been like an firmed
camp. Several posses set out for the
desperadoes, who are led by Bambert
and Gill. They have been several times
arrested for murder. The desperadoes
were found, but fortified themselves in
a house and drove off the posse, which
returned to Tangipahoa for reinlorce
mer.ts.
The desperadoes retreated into Wash
ington Parish, where some forty or fifty
of them assembled in a house fifteen
miles east of Franklinton. They have
since taken refuge in a swamp on Pearl
River on the boundary line of Louisia
na and Mississippi.
These swamps will be searchÃ-I to
morrow, and a battle royal is expected.
There is a strong determination to
crush out the brigands, who have so
long terrorized that section.
MYSTERY CONNECTED
WITH CONLON'S DEATH
Affairs of the Deceased Semi-Million-
aire Being Rushed by Mrs.
Abbie Kinnes.
SAN JOSE, April 6.â There is an in
creasing mystery surrounding the death
of John P. Conlon, the semi-millionaire
of New York City, which resulted from
apoplexy here yesterday morning. Mrs.
Abbie Kinnes, who occupied the relation
ship of niece and adopted daughter, be
sides passing as Mrs. Conlon, refuses to
give out any information regarding the
deceased. She, however, states that all
of Conlon's property has been left to her.
At the same time she admits she has a
cousin who, but for his wild escapades,
would have come in for equal inheritance.
Mrs. Kinnes will start East to-morrow.
She appears to have an unlimited amount
of cash and has spared no expense in
funeral arrangements. A JSOO casket has
been purchased from W. L. Woodrow, the
undertaker, and other appointments for
the deceased are of the same costly or
der. The body has been embalmed and
will be shipped East to-morrow morning.
It is consigned to George Kendrick, un.
dertaker, 274 Broadway, Brooklyn. N. Y.
This was done on telegraphic instructions
from New York.
Mrs. Klnnt'S to-day engaged Attorneys
Tuttle and Patton to look after her in
terests, and spent most of the day with
them. No will was found among Conlon's
effects, but it is said such an instrument
lies in the vault of an Eastern bank. The
only other relative of Conlon is a
nephew bearing his name, but he has been
disowned and disinherited. Although hei
adopted father gave her much property,
it is said Mrs. Kinnes has deeds of re
cent date to valuable New York real es
tate. These she seems anxious to rush
into record before the nephew can takÂ«
steps to secure his share. Her attorneys
refuse to discuss affairs, but assert that
their client is all she professes to be in
regard to relationship to Tonlon.
Mrs. Kinnes submitted to a short inter
view to-night, and then unceremoniously
bouncod the reporters. She tells several
conflicting stories. She says John P. Con
lon Inherited his wealth from his father,
who bore the same name, and was a ship
builder and contractor. Conlon's wealth
she estimates at over $500,00n, consisting
of tenement houses and warehouses in
New York City. She refused to tell where
the property was located, and finally said
she did not know, as the janitor, who
had been in her uncle's employ for half
a century, attended to the business. Two
years ago she and her uncle kept house
at 437 One Hundred and Twenty-third
street. New York, and at other times
stopped at various hotels. This was the
only address she would give. Mrs. Kinnes
said her husband was Andrew Kinnes,
an employe of the New York Custom
house. She denied being the adopted
daughter, as well as niece of the dead
man. but she showed to the undertaker
a certificate of adoption. Mrs. Kinnes
said her uncle and herself were the only
two remaining relatives of the family and
had traveled together for seven years.

A VICTIM OF SAN

"Ir\ar\itior\."
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. April 6.â
Manuel Rossas, the Portuguese negro
who was thumped into insensibility and
placed in a straitjacket for assaulting
Guard Randolph, died yesterday. In
the death certificate the cause of the
prisoner's death is given as "inanition."
but if the words of reliable guards at
the prison are to be believed, it was a
case of too much straitjacket and too
little medical attention.
As the time draws near when Hale
is to be deposed the mouths of the
guards begin to give forth strange
tales, and the case of Rossas is not
the least of them. In the middle of
February last Rossas refused to take
his proper place in the line for the
chapel, and finally attacked Guard
Randolph. Help for Randolph arrived
in the person of Guard Henry Moller.
who knocked Rossas senseless with a
cane at Captain Edgar's command.
The convict was then placed in a strait
jacket in the dungeon.
At that time he was a magnificent
specimen of physical manhood, over six
FRAUDS MAY HOT
BE INVESTIGATED
Stockton Ballot Jugglers
Likely to Escape.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, April 6.â lt developed
to-day that when the Grand Jury ad
journed last evening it was until the
loth of May, and not till to-day, when it
was supposed the investigation of the
alleged ballot-box stuffing would be
continued.- As the Republican conven
tion assembles Monday the proceeding
the jury may take will come after the
excitement of the convention and elec
tion is over. There is considerable
criticism and speculation over the
jury's action, as a large body of citizens
insist that the frauds, if any were
actually perpetrated, should be probed
without fear or favor. The contesting
delegation in the Third Ward, accord
ing to report, will not carry their case
to the Superior Court, but will demand
recognition in the convention. As the
new law does not empower conventions
to pass on such matters the announce
ment is equivalent to an abandonment
of the contest.
District Attorney Ashley refuses to
state whether any action will be taken
by him in the matter or not, answering
all questions with the reply that his
tongue is tied by law.
William Purcell and Frank Tuttle,
who are said by Watson to have been
present when an attempt was made by
Eckstrom to hush the matter by getting
Visher to help him out, stoutly deny
that they were present at any such
meeting. They say Watson is trying
to implicate them in the case. The
friends of Eckstrom and Patterson are
active in their behalf and assume to
make light of the charges.
The City Clerk was busy to-day mak
ing out certificates of election for dele
gates of both parties. They are issued
in the same form as certificates of elec
tion to office. The delegates must pre
sent them at the convention and on so
doing become members of a legally con
stituted body. A committee on creden
tials in the convention will no longer
be necessary.
"SANTIAGO" MORPHY
AGAIN IN THE TOILS
The Fugitive Mexican Embezzler
Captured by Two Detectives
at Kansas City.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. , April 6.â "Santiago"
Morphy. alias "Mexican Morphy." who is
well known in horse racing circles
throughout this country and who is want
ed in Mexico on a charge of embezzling
$70,000 from a Mexican bank, was arrested
here to-day by Detectives Sanderson and
Schulz. Morphy was captured at the
Stratford House at Eighth and Holmes
streets, where he says he has been for
five weeks.
The detectives had located Morphy and
were waiting for him when he stepped out
of the office door. He recognized Schulz
and ran into the barroom and back into
the office and up the stairs. The officers
were close at his heels, and caught him
as he reached' the third floor. There is a
reward of $500 for Morphy's arrest, which
Schulz and Sanderson will divide.
Morphy was arrested in New Orleans
nn January 14 and turned over to a Mexi
can officer. In broad daylight on a crowd
ed street six of Morphy's friends sur
rounded the pair while the officer was
taking his prisoner to the depot. One of
them felled the officer to the walk with a
blow from a slungshot and Morphy
jumped into a waiting carriage and es
caped. His friends mingled with the
crowd and also escaped.

Soon ugly rumors were circulated that
the man was dying from his Injuries
and lack of medical attention. Both
Dr. Lawlor, the prison physician, and
Warden Hale were interviewed by The
Call correspondent, and both declared
Rossas was shamming, and that this
was conclusively proved by the mirror
and match tests. However, they took
the precaution to place the injured con
vict in the hospital. Yesterday he died,
and Warden Hale attempts to justify
the verdict of "inanition" by asserting
Rossas would not eat, and died of
starvation. Rossas was in a state of
coma from the time he was placed In
the dungeon until he died. The death
of this man under such peculiar cir
cumstances following upon the pub
licity given the inhuman treatment ac
corded eight convicts upon the word
of a stool pigeon afterward discredited
has caused Hale to be criticized In un
measured terms by his own men. and
Dr. Lawlor is not highly complimented.
Inanition is his favorite reason for a
death, even in a case of death by the
use of opium. On account of being so
indefinite a word it is said to have
also met Hale's favor.

ployment. On Sunday morning he was
approached by Norris and Scott and
asked if he wanted work, stating that
they were looking for men to go to
Blakeley to work in a lumber yard.
Benson replied that he would accept
the job, and with a number of others
was taken to Blakeley, where the bark
Troop was being towed out of the har
bor. Their launch circled around thÂ«
vessel until she had got outside the
harbor, when it ran alongside and made
fast. The men were ordered aboard.
All complied except Benson, when he
was struck on the head and one of the
outfit drew a gun and threatened to kill
him. During the scuffle his blankets
were put aboard and, fearing for his
life, he went aboard and the launch
started for Seattle.
When British Consul Rothschild went
aboard the Troop, Benson and two
others refused to ship, and they were
ordered ashore.
Benson claims that Norris and Scott
landed them two miles from town, tell
ing them they could secure work near
there, also that if they came across to
Port Townsend they would be killed.
Later they went to Port Townsend and
laid the matter before Chaplain Terry,
of the Seamen's Bethel, who had war
rants issued for Scott and Norris. They
had left before Deputy Marshal Strin
ger arrived from Seattle to arrest
them. ____________
APTOS BRIDGE SCANDAL.
Trial of Elwell for an Alleged At
tempt at Bribery.
SANTA CRUZ. April 6.â The trial of F.
D. Elwell on a charge of attempted brib
ery was resumed in the Superior Court
to-day. N. Mosher, the principal witness
for the prosecution, failed to remember
some material facts. In substance Mosher
testified that Elwell met him and said.
"What are you going to do with us?"
Mosher replied, "I'm protecting myself in
this competition." Referring to the Aptos
bridge plans, Elwell said, "There's $250
in it to straighten out." Mosher replied
that he did not want to commit perjury.
Elwell said he did not ask him to; that
he would pay Mosher what hie testimony
was worth, not less than $100. Mosher
admitted that subsequently the Supervi
sors advertised for new bridge plans, and
his only were submitted. He testified
that in the conversation with Elwell the
Supervisors on the proposed investiga
tion were not mentioned.
No witnesses to the conversation or
money were produced by Elwell.
Attorney Lindsay asked Judge Smith to
instruct the jury to acquit, owing to the
failure of the prosecution to substantiate
the allegations. The case will go to the
jury to-morrow.

GRAND JURY DOES
BUT LITTLE WORK
THRASHING OVER OLD SCHOOL
BOARD AFEAIRS.
Indictment Found Against P. J.
Wynn on a Charge of Obtain
ing Money by False Pre
tenses.
Yesterday's session of the Grand Jury j
was devoted almost exclusively to the j
consideration of School Department af- 1
fairs. The old straw that was gone over!
by the last Grand Jury is again being I
thrashed, but the prospects of anything j
being accomplished are very vague in- i
deed. For the past few weeks the jury's
expert has been engaged in going over
the accounts of goods and materials pur- j
chased by the old School Board, and the i
result of his investigations in this direc- j
tion was laid before the members yester
day.
The present Grand Jury ha? been in ex
istence since the first of the year, and
all that it has shown for its work is two !
or three indictments against petty of
fenders -who had escaped the clutches of
the law in the Police Courts, and as a
consequence there seems little prospect
that the coming three months will be pro- [
ductive of better results than have the
last three.
At 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon the
Grand Jury repaired to Judge Dainger
tield's department of the Superior Court
and tiled an indictment against P. J. '
Wynn on a charge of obtaining money by
false pretenses. It apears that some time \
ago Wynn represented to a man named \
John King that he owned the stock and
fixtures of a saloon at W3 Mission street.
King agreed to purchase the saloon, and
3>aid Wynn 1145 on account of the pur- â 
chase price. After taking possession he '
ascertained that the saloon fixtures be- j

FORSOOK HER
RECKLESS LIFE
FOR THE GRAVE
Sad End of a Young
and Pretty Woman.
IN LOVE WITH A WAITER
MARRIED. BUT NEGLECTED HIS
FAMILY FOR HER.
She Wrote a Gossipy Letter to
Her Father and Then Took a
Fatal Dose of Carbolic
Acid.
Nellie Shcehan. a young woman about
lit years of age, of i- Bartleti street, was
i found writhing on a bed in her room it
105 Stockton street last night. She was
taken to the Receiving Hospital whore
her case was diagnosed as carbolic acid
poisoninf. The usual remedies were ad
: minif-tertu. but the deadly drug bad taken
its effect, and within an hour she died
and the bedy was taken to the Morgue.
ThÂ« case of the woman is â  somewhat
I shrouded in mystery. The housÂ» where
she t'.'> k the poison is located in â what
1 miv be termed the new tender'oln. It
bears -.he name of .> lodging-nous;;, but
has its own reputation, not to Â»â¢Â» envied.
i The landlady would say nothing. She
claimed, as is the custom at such houses,
; that nothing was known of the *voman; |
she had simply rented a room in the
house for the night and had take;i the
poison there. The landlady had never
' seen her before, did not know her name
. or who her friends were.
When searched at the Morgue there was
â  a portion of a letter inscribed to "ray
dear father" and an American District
Telegraph Company's envelope directed
to "Billy Isaacs." The note Inside the
envelope" was almost unintelligible, but
I so much of it as could be deciphered read
; as follows:
i "If it is convenient for you to meet
I me-"
Who the Billy Isaacs referred to in the
address is can only be surmised, but there
is a man of that name who has served
irregularly as a waiter in the Seal Rock
House and at the Oberon. At the Oberon
â¢ it was stated that Isaacs was a married
| man and his wife had given birth to a
: child about three weeks ago. He had
i been neglecting his wife for a woman
J room at lift Stockton street, whose ap
pearance answers the description of the
I woman who now occupies a slab at the
' Morg Shortly after Isaacs' child was
j born" his wife appeared at the Oberon and
| told Mr. Fisher, the proprietor, that she
j was in destitute circumstances. A collec
tion was taken up among the waiters,
i which plied enough money to pay off
t all outstanding debts and assure food for
; a few days. This is about all that is
] known of' Isaacs and his connection with
j the suicide. He is described as a hand-
I some but reckless man, hose love of the
fair ox is apt to carry him to any ex
! treme. .v"-'- : '.'â â '.
The portion of a letter found on the
' body of the dead woman throws little
j light on her or her life. It is as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO March 23. 15*9.
Dear Father: 1 thought I would write you
! these few lines and let you know that I am

Here the letter ends a*: abruptly as did
the life of its author. She was evidently
a woman who felt hen cast upon the
world for a livelihood and found that the
world used her roughly. The identifica
tion was made by Police Officer Fennell.
but he was neither certain of name nor ad
dress. It is supposed that the mother of
the suicide is dend. and that the "old
lady" mentioned in the letter is her fath
er's second wife.
A man representing himself to be a.
Dr. Shields snatched letters which were
found on the woman's person from Office*
Fennell as he was handling- them at the
Receiving Hospital. He then succeeded
in making good his escape, but the offi

JOE MATTOON'S BOX OF
OOLONG THAT FAILED
CUSTOMS BROKER JOSEPH S. MATTOON is agent for several tea
importers, and as such is an expert on the fragrant herb and a lover
of the decoction brewed therefrom. Until a recent very distressing epi
sode in his career he has been in the habit Of taking his lunch in a
Slavonian restaurant in the neighborhood of the Custom-house.
Restaurant tea not being up to the standard, of Broker Mattoon's taste,
he overcame the objection by bringing to the restaurant a five-pound box
cf choice Oolong, price $1 per pound.
"Here," Spiro." he said. "I can't drink your tea: it's as good as the next,
but not good enough for me- Now, here's a box of the real choice article.
Make my pot of tea out of it every day, and when it's used up, shout, and
111 get you another."
A pot of the aromatic beverage was soon steaming on the table, and the
broker drained the cup in ecstacy with his eyes closed. ,
The next day he imparted his plan to three of his fellow-brokers and
invited them to lunch with him to taste his fine Oolong. They accepted the
invitation, but when the tea was brought they tasted it and sniffed at it
suspiciously.
"Say. Joe," said one of them indignantly. ""What kind of a rig is this
you're putting up on us? This is the real cabbage-leaf mixture."
Broker Mattoan gave one swift glance at his cup. tasted a spoonful,
spat it out, and yelled: "Here. Spire, you scoundrel! What do you mean
by giving me this stuff? Where's my te*. you rascal?"
A i waiter approached t â  â¢ I .
"Spiro sold out yesterday." he said.
"Where's my box of tear' roared Maltoon.
"Spiro took the boi of tea with him," replied the waiter.
It cost XI At to-.-:; three broiled birds to exact a pledge from his friends
to say nothing about the affair. But the tea story leaked, and now Mattoon

THE PAGO PAGO CONTRACT.
The United States Transport Scindia
to Be Sent to Samoa to Guard
the Station.
Since the outbreak of war in Samoa j
the threatening attitude of the natives [
toward the white population has given
the contractors for the Pago-Pago coal- !
ing station a good deal of anxiety. |
Messrs. Healy, Tibbits & Co., wnose
contract for the erection of a wharf, coal
ing sheds, etc., involves an outlay of j
some $200,00.), were naturally concerned !
for the safety of their men and prop- '
erty. The firm has recently chartered
the British iron ship Cardigan Castle to :
take some 1200 tons of material to Sa- |
moa, and forty skilled mechanics are to j
be sent to carry out the work. The
United States armed collier Abarenda i
is to be dispatched from the East with !
the steel piling for the wharf, but as she j
cannot arrive at Pago-Pago within less j
than a month after the contractors' ;
party, there was a pleasant prospect of I.
the whole outfit being exposed to the ray- |
ages of the Tutuila natives, who have the j
reputation of being the fiercest in the j
whole group. Healy, Tibbits & Co. being 1
naturally desirous of carrying on their
business in a peaceful wayâ for war on
a small - &1Â« was not Included in the ;
specifications of their contract â made j
representations to Washington. Though i
the Philadelphia is at Apia, it is hardly !
likely that she could be spared from her !
important diplomatic work at this cen- I
tral port to protect the contractors at j
Pago Pago, some seventy miles away.
However, the news which came vester- i
day lifted a weight of trouble from the j
contractors' brows. The naval authori- ;
I ties have decided to dispatch the armtd E
I transport Scindia with a load of coal !
i to Samoa, and incidentally, while lying S
i in Pago Pago harbor, her quick
j guns will serves to protect the workmen
from native inroads. It is feared that |
the Germans, who are notoriously op
posed to the United States gaining a foot
hold in Samoa, are intriguing with the j
natives in order to induce them to op- j
pose the construction of the coaling sta- â¢
Uon. Hence the dispatch of the 9 India,
which has been decided upon none too
early.
The Scindia, formerly a merchant ves
sel, is a powerful steamer of 2953 tons j
register. She accompanied the lowa as
supply ship on her voyage around the
Horn, and performed her duties with
great sucess. Built as a cargo boat, she
I carries an enormous load, and in addition
has been supplied with an armament of
quick-firing guns, powerful enough to ;
! deal with any native force she may â 
I chance to meet. Since her arrival at !
San Francisco she has been docked and â¢
1 refitted at Mare Island, and has been put
into a condition of thorough fitness for
the long tropical voyage she is to under
take.
WANT POLK STUEZT GRADED.
Its Condition Prevents the Sutter-
Street Cars From Going to
North Beach.
The enterprising: business men on Polk
street, who arethe pioneers in this city
cf modern street illumination, are still m
the field for further progress. The paving
of Polk street from Suiter to Jackson
with bitumen stands paramount to a 11,I 1 ,
other claims for that section of the city.
This improvement is one that will not be
!ost sight of until its consummation has
been secured. Since Van Ness avenue has
been made a boulevard all traiSc leading
into the northwestern side of the city is
forced to pass along Polk street. "This
has driven pusiness -.way from that thor
oughfare and vacant houses and stores
are the consequence.
Aside from this inconvenience the north
end of the street, notwithstanding the
cutting of the "hoe's back" .-.: Green
wich street, cannot be used by the bust
ness men in reaching the commercial cen
ter of the city by the Xorth Beach route.
The obstacle which prevents light deliv
ery wagons from running over "this road
is the unevenness of the grade between
Lombard and Bay streets. The stretch
of roadway along- this line resembles the
letter W inverted. It has two sharp
points; one at Lombard and th other at
Francisco street, with a deep depression
in the center.
Until this street is graded the Poik
street car line carrot be continued to the
bay shore. The Sutter Street Company
has a franchise for this portion of the
street for a continuation of its cable serv
ice and it is willing and anxious to run
cars right through to the bay. Hence it
is that the Polk Street Business Men's
Association will urge the placing of the
street in proper condition out of next
year's tax levy.

The Lieutenant and His Men "Will
Continue to Harass the Chinese
Gamblers and Intimidate
Highbinders.
Lieutenant Price and his squad of of
ficers will not be withdrawn from the Chi
nese qua.; - led that they are in
nocent of the charges of corruption
brought against them, Chief Lees has de
cided not to interfere with them.
Price and his men, smarting- under the
humiliation of being charged with corrupt
practices, yesterday morning visited the
office of Chief Lees and pleaded with him j
to further relieve them of duty in the >
Chinese quarter.
â¢'We might have made mistakes." re- j
marked Price, who acted as spokesman
for the squad, "but I defy any one to
that we accepted a cent from the
gamblers of Chinatown. Now that my
Integrity has been assailed I respectfully
ask that myself and men be taken out of
Che Chinese quarter." .
b, after declaring his belief m ,
a honesty, told him that while he j
was inclined to grant him his request, he
concluded that it was better for tne in
terest of the department that he remain
in Chinatown. . _â
"lm satisfied that you and your men
are honest." remarked the head of the j
department, "and in face of the absurd j
charges that have been brought against
you I think it is proper for you to return
to Chinatown and continue as you aa\e
been d - Â â
Price and his men then filed out of the
Chiefs office and returned to their sta
tions in the Chinese quarter.
"I am thoroughly convinced of the hon
esty of Pr bis men." remarked
Chief Lees last night. ,
gs the Chinese consul
came to me and after reviewing the nu
merous crimes In Chinatown asked that
at Price be detailed to suppress the
murderous highbinders. As Lieutenant
- in charge of the â 
-quad 1 told him 1 would think the matter
. vÂ« r and ask- d him to call a few days
The highbinders seemed to be run
ning things with a high hand and as Eso- |
â  equal to tl n I picked
out rtve of the mo?: ID the
t and with Price as their lead
m in Chinatown after to
ting them as to their duties. That
they faithfully carried out my Insl
lions in the report of Price,
which is on rile in my office.
"I am satisfied with the work of Price
and his men and intend to keep them in
Chinatown until I see fit to relieve them.
"However. I propose to pursue my in- j
vest;- . :he alleged corruption in
the Chinese quarter, and if I fin.:
any of my men have been ace
gai - I will be
for his dismissal from the

A QUIET WEDDING.
] Lieutenant N. C. Twining of the lowa
and Mrs. C. S. Baker Made One.
Lieutenant N. C. Twining. U. S. N., who
is assigned on the battleship lowa, was
married Wednesday to Mrs. C. S. Baker of
Washington, D. C. The ceremony to-.k
place in St. Stephen's Episcopal Church
j and was performed by the pastor. Rev.
Dr. Edgar Lion.
A pretty little romance centers around
the quiet wedding. A few days ago Mrs.
Baker arrived in this city with her broth
in-law, B. W. J. Fox, of New Wk, and
! registered at the California Hotel. She
I had crossed the continent to wed the man
! of her choice and the love match which
j originated some months ago in VVashing-
I ton had its culmination in the marriage
i yesterday. The bride was attended by
Mra L. T. Jones, a daughter of Captain
i F. M. Munger of the revenue cutter ser
vice, and the groom had Chaplain t . C.
Brown for his best man. --Â»â¢ -Â»â 
After the ceremony the bridal part> was
driven to the Palace Hotel where a wed
ding breakfast was enjoyably discussed.
Lieutenant Twining and his wife will
remain in San Francisco during the
lowa's stay in this harbor. In May the
I vessel will' proceed to Puget Sound to be
| docked and Mrs. Twining will await her
.nd's return to this city, when the
. will come back here for orders.
CREDITORS TO CONFER.
Debating the Distribution of a PoÂ«
--sible $35,000.
The merchant creditors of the School
Department are discussing, among them
selves how they shall "divide up the
136,000 they would get by the terms of
fered last Monday by the teachers should
they accept the proposition. There are
two" classes of creditorsâ those whose
claims were submitted December 17 and
those made December 31. The creditors
of December 17 claim they are entitled
to first payment, and as their bills
amount to more than the 535.000, it looked
bad for the creditors of December 31 un
til a conference was decided upon.
The creditors met in the rooms of the
Board of Trade yesterday morning and
appointed a committee which will con
trst with the teachers and then with
itself to decide just how much money is
coming and how it shall be divided. The
committee is composed of the following;
Benjamin Bangs. Thomas Morton, J. A.
Snook, Harry Jones, Oscar Mores. G S.
Graham, J. E. O'Brien and J. J. O Brien.
To Limit Liability.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company
and the Pacific Coast Company have pe
titioned United States District Judge de
Haven to limit the liability of the two
companies for the loss of the cargo of the
steamship Corona off the coast of Alaska
on January _ The petitioners ask
for an appraiser to fix the vaiue of the
vessel and cargo at the time of the wreck.

TRAINING SCHOOL.
The New Building Soon to Appear on Yerba Buena, Alias "Goat Island."
WHEN Congress last May appropriated $100,000 for the erection of a Naval Training School
on this const Yerba Buena Island was selected as the site best suited for the purposes
of such a school, and C;iptajn Henry Glass, who has commanded the Texas and Charles
ton, waa s the Commandant of the school. Captain Glass is one of the most ex
rs in the service and for the past three months he has been busy at work
preparing - rection of the buildings that are to compose the training school. The
contract for I â â â  erection of the school was awarded to Campbell & Pettus of this city,
and the work will be commenced ihis week. Already much has been done toward getting the
irf has been completed and the beach roadway built.
The mar. building, as the picture shows, is unique, especially as regards its interior design.
It is sm ' "m'nine qnany of the characteristics of a ship. It is the first building
that the ant has constructed upon modern barracks principles, and it is the first devised
irs. The structure is classical in its design, especially so for a
â¢ â¢. > of architecture used is attractive to the eye. It is three hundred
. its main part containing the large drill hall on the lower floor, with a
â¢ \ deck above extending the entire length of the building. There are wines at
. !ding sixty feet wide, and which extend a hundred feet to the rear. These

m, library and offices. The .entire interior of the building is open to the roof," and there
pt the gallery, twelve feet wide, which extends all abound the' hall. All
ments have been carefully studied out with the single view of conforming as much
the routine of life on ship.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FBIDAY, APRIL 7, 1899.
The training ship Pensacola, which was brought down from Mare Island ten days ago, is
now anchored off Yerba Buena Island. Captain Glass has established his headquarters on this
ship and Is now busy superintending the enlistment of naval apprentices and matters pertaining
to the building of the Training School. He said yesterday that the school would be completed by
September. There are to be built a number of officers' quarters. Until they are completed Captain
Glass and the seven officers who are to be his assistants in the direction of the affairs of the
schcol will continue to live aboard the Pensacola. In speaking of the school Captain Glass said:
"When it is finished it will be in every particular as nearly perfect as money and experi
ence can make it. The school will meet all requirements and it will be equal to the Training School
at Newport. A new impetus has been given to the naval system of training boys to become 'the
men behind the guns," especially since the importance of good marksmanship was shown at
Majiila and Santiago, where the economy of all the money that had been spent in teaching the
young idea how to shoot was so tellingly emphasized. Nearly all of the men who sighted the
ordnance of the battleships and cruisers with such terrible effect that the entire Spanish force
afloat was annihilated in two battles, each of short duration, had been graduated from the appren
tice training ships. With tho prospect of an enlarged navy the necessity for drilling men-o'-war.'s
men from youth to maturity has materially increased, and the Navy Department has lost no
time in expanding its well-proven system to meet the demand."
Captain Glass reports that apprentices are rapidly enlisting. The training ship Adams which
recently left on a nve months' cruise, carried 160 boys, and tha Mohican will also leave' in the
near future for a cruise nnd will carry all the boys that have been enlisted up to that time The
Pensacola will remain here permanently as the receiving ship, and it is on board this vesÂ«e'l that
all applicants have to appear to be examined.

REV. F. G. TYRRELL
MAY LOCATE HERE
West End Christian
Church After a Dis
tinguished St. Louis
Divine.
THE West End Christian
Church of San Francisco and
the First Christian Church of
Chicago are engaged in a
friendly but spirited rivalry.
Both are anxious for Rev. F. G.
Tyrrell, at present pastor of the
Central Christian Church of St.
Louis, to fill their pulpits, with the
chances of each about even. Rev.
Mr. Tyrrell is a young man, a native
of California and a graduate of the
I niversity of California, who start
ed out to practice law. but decided
to follow In the footsteps of his
father and preach the gospel. In the
nine years he has been pastor of
the St. Louis church Rev. Mr. Tyr
rell gathered together a big congre
gation and built up a reputation as
an eloquent pulpit orator, which re
sulted in his receiving a call from
Chicago as soon as his intention to
resign his pastorate became known
in the Windy City. Rev. Mr. Tyr
rell's reason for severing his connec
tion with the Central Church is his
desire to work in other fields offer
ing larger opportunities. Ho believes
it is not well either for the church
or pastor for the latter to remain
long in one pulpit.
While the West End Church has
not extended a formal call to the St.
Louis divine, the board of trustees
is anxious to secure him as pastor to
succeed the Rev. Dr. Gardiner, who
resigned last September on account
of ill health and is now in Honolulu.
The trustees fear that the church
may not be able to offer sufficient
inducements to a man whose reputa
tion is such that he can practically
name his own price, but Mr. Tyrrell
is coming to San Franclscu during
summer and will hold a protracted
meeting under the auspices of the
put in a rate by way of Guatemala that
would give him all the- business that
could boar transportation by that route,
and he would not need to lose any money
in the undertaking. The long water haul
will enable him to put rates where no
competitor other than the clippers that
go around Cape Horn will he able to
touch them.
The contract of the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company with the Panama Rail
road Company has less than two years
to run, and by the time it expires Hunt
ington will have his Guatemala road from
the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Coast
in shape for operation.
Those who are familiar with Hunting
ton's methods no not believe he will wield
his powerful influence in the interests of
low rates, hut will use his cheap trans
portation facilities for the purpose of
compelling his railroad rivals to give up
to him a larger share of business than he
now receives.
As a result of Huntington's severance
of connection with the Panama line it is
highly probable that the latter will re
sume operations on an independent basis
between the Pacific Coast and the At
lantic, suc-h as it was successfully car
rying on before its aggressiveness forced
the Pacific Mail into entering upon the
present arrangements.
Another motive for this latest stra'getic
move of Huntington lies- in the fact that
it will give employment to his Newport
News shipyards, as the new route will
require several large steamers.
TO REPRODUCE DAWSON.
Gigantic Enterprise of a Company of
Klondike Capitalists.
Robert Blei. general manager of the
Klondike-Yukon Paris Exposition Com
pany, arrived in this city yesterday from
Dawson. The company of which Mr. Blci
Is the general manager is incorporated
with a capital of $1,000,000, the most of
which has been subscribed by leading citi
zens of Dawson. Its object is to repro
duce the city of Dawson at the Paris Ex.
position, or Just outside the exposition
grounds. Every building in the northern
mining city will be faithfully reproduced
full size and every feature of life Includ
ing mining operations, will bo shown Mr
Blei starts for Paris to-day, and when he
gets the work fairly started will return to
this country. He is taking but twenty
five men with him. but expects to employ
at least 1000. Two hundred Indians and
500 dogs will be taken over to give the
city a true local coloring. Gold dust and
Klondike nuggets will be sold in the
transported city.
church. He will spend several
months in California attending a
reunion of the Tyrrell family at
Ferndale and resting from his la
bors. His resignation of his present
pastorate takes effect about the Ist
of June. It is relieved that Mr. Tyr
rell prefers the Pacific Coast to the
East, and from the tone of his let
ters to the trustees of the West End
Church the latter are hopeful that
they will be able to meet his terms.
They have been in correspondence
with him for several months in re
gard to his proposition to hold a
protracted meeting in this city in
August, but it was not known until
a day or two ago that he had re
ceived a call from Chicago. Upon
receipt of that information the
trustees immediately wrote to Mr.
Tyrrell requesting him not to accept
the call until he heard from them
further. Mr. Tyrrell is at present
in Chicago.

THE SCOTCHMAN
AS A HUMORIST
AND AS A LOVER
Second of lan Mao
laren's Lectures.
PECULIARITIES OF THE RACE
APPRECIATE A JOKE IF GIVEN
TIME TO DIGEST IT.
Various Kinds of Humor Character
istics of Different Nations Enter
tainingly Defined by the
Novelist.
"The humor of the Scot and the senti
ment" were described in a most enter
taining manner by Dr. John Watson (lan
Maclaren) before a large and apprecia
tive audience at the California Theater
last evening. Barring a habit of lowering
his voice at the close of a sentence Until
the linal two or three syllables are in
audible and his hearers have to guess
at them, the noted author has a pleasing
delivery and is careful to avoid too much
dialect, except when reading from his
works.
Lan Maclaren has made the character- '
istics of his countrymen, a life study I
that is evident even more from his lectures
than his books; and while he is quick \
to discern the difference in their natures i
from the traits of other peoples, he does
not hesitate to draw comparisons, firm- :
ly believing that the Scots will not suffer '
by the showing. Nor do they.
Born under the dull, gray clouds and !
nurtured by the strong east winds he ;
said it was not surprising the Scotch took
their humor seriously, it might take a !
Scotchman twenty-four hours to give a '
jest the consideration he deemed it neces
sary, but if he finally became convinced :
that it was a jest nobody would do it
greater honor than he.
Humor, said the lecturer, covers a very
wide held, and its different phases are â 
characteristic of different nations If â 
one sought the most delicate flower of
humor, one must go to France. The
light, effervescent humor of the Paris
ian was the acme of wit. At the samp
time humor is it really safe to c^ll
wit numor ;
"What 1 mean by wit is this: Two men
were riding together one day through
Pans. One was exceedingly bright and
clever while the other was correspond
ingly dull. As is usually the case the lat
ter monopolized the conversation The
talk of the dullard had become almost
unendurable, when his companion saw a
man on the street far ahead yawningâ
not the polite, smothered yawn of society
but a good, large gape, with no attempt
whatever at concealment. 'Look,' ex
claimed the first man, 'we are overheard '
"That story divides the sheep from the.
goats. I was telling it once to a Scotch
lady, who remarked: 'How could they
have been overheard at that distance 0 '
'Madam.' I replied, 'that never occurred to
me before.'
"I am sorry to say we have no claim to
wit, nor to John Bull humor, which is
fun. With a stroke of fun an English
speaker will please an entire audience i
Had our own people the sense of fun our I
liv< s would have been better and our re- !
ligion belter. Nor do the Scotch lay any
claim to that irresistible humor called
drollery of our Irish friends.
"The humor of the American people is
hard to class, it is so varied; but there
is still another kind of humor that is most â 
intellectual and ironical, and irony is the
humor of the Scotch. Irony is not genial; i
what I plead for irony is that it is
strong."
The different kinds of humor were il- j
lustrated in an inimitable manner by the '
speaker, and after he had exhausted the :
subject he turned to the sentimental side i
of the. Scot, reading many passages from I
his own works to bring out the strong do- ;
mesilc affections and the intense love of
home of his people.

TAX SHIRKERS fIGAIN REBUFFED.
AMONG the recent decisions which have come
to hand is one by the Supreme Court of
Michigan holding that the tax-shirking ex-
SS, which for upward of a year now
been evading their war taxes, must stamp bills
of lading before issuing them. The case in which this
opi: ndered was an application ior a writ of
c of the Circuit Courts of Michigan
le by Attorney General Maynard at the request of
a number of shippers. The suit was brought against
American Express Company, and the court was
I to order that corporation to stamp its bills of
â¢ .re issuing them.
The opinion, written by Justice Long, is an exten
nation upon the subject of revenue, the
power of Congress to impose stamp taxes, the juris
diction of State courts to issue writs of mandate, and
the duty of express companies under schedule A of
the war revenue act to pay their taxes. In the
course of his observations under the latter head Jus
tice Long says:
"By the act every express company is compelled to
issue to every shipper or consignor a bill of lading
for each shipment received for carriage, to which bill
of lading and duplicate thereof shall be attached and
canceled a stamp of the value of I cent. The law,
therefore, imposes upon the carrier the obligation to
issue the receipt. With this the shipper has nothing
to do. He delivers the package to the company,
pays or tenders the usual charges. This ends the
shipper's duty, and the law then compels the carrier
sue the receipt or bill of lading. This bill must
be stamped and the stamp canceled. It is evident that
it is as much the duty of the company to place the
stamp upon the receipt and cancel it as it is to issue
the receipt. This duty is made more apparent by the
that the act further provides that failure to issue
the receipt makes the carrier so failing amenable to a
heavy penalty."
This states the case succinctly, and in accordance
vith the opinion the Michigan Supreme Court
unanimously ordered the mandate to issue, thus put
fing on record in a practical Way its view of the law.
The American Express Company, however, has ap
pealed to the United States Supreme Court and thus
hung up the decision. In the meantime it is robbing
the shippers of Michigan, as Wells, Fargo & Co. arc
robbing the shippers of California, out of several
thousand dollars per month.
The interesting question in connection with this
matter, however, is, how are the shippers to get even
or. the express companies after the United States Su
preme Court sustains all the decisions rendered by
the State and inferior Federal courts? At present the
shippers arc paying the war taxes of the express
companies. Is there any way in which they can re
coup themselves later on?
In all the talk and wrangle over the various Demo
cratic banquets it is worth while noting that during
the days when they controlled the country and fixed
the tariff the great mass of them had nothing to eat
but crow: but now, thanks to Republican prosper
ity, they can have banquets to tight about.

THE BEEF INQUIRY.
NO matter what may be the verdict of the com
mission now inquiring into the beef ration fur
nished during the Spanish war, American in
terests in meat products are going to suffer.
This country is the largest producer and purveyor
of meat products in the world. Our corn and fodder
facilities are unlimited, and upon them depend our
beef and pork. The proper curing of these meats
with salt, saltpeter and sugar is a comparatively slow
process, but it is wholesome. Pork products cured
by these agents, and smoked, have excellent keeping
qualities and furnish a nourishing element in diet.
It is highly probable that the sudden demand for
large quantities of meat in condition lit for army ra
tions caused the use of novel chemicals and experi
ments in the hasty preparation of the meat for use in
military camps and in the tropics, and that the hurry
orders were responsible for methods that have not
been in use in the preparation of meat for the usual
market. But this fact will not be apt to get due
weight in the mind of the foreign consumer and of our
competitors. No doubt it was a mistake to attempt
the use of a beef ration in the tropics. Experience
demonstrates that a salt pork ration is the best there.
We have always had a large outlet for salted pork
among the laboring population of the West Indies.
! The negro laborers there use it with molasses as a
| condiment, and it seems to be the best meat ration
: for that climate. As there is no prospect that we will
: extricate ourselves from the risk and cost of military
, occupation in the tropics for several years, if at all, it
; will be well to extract some practical policy out of the
, beef scandal.
The military nations of Europe have made the army
ration the subject of the best scientific study. The
German army in the French war was furnished with
a ration that carried the highest amount of nutrition
i:i the smallest possible bulk. The German pea
sausage, scientifically prepared, with nitrogen and all
the elements of a wholesome diet, was probably the
best constituent of a ration ever furnished to a sol
dier. Its preparation was easy, and it taxed digestion
the least while sustaining the soldier in the supreme
exertion of battle better than anything theretofore
tried.
There is a pea grown in Japan that upon analysis
and experiment shows the highest food qualities
found in the leguminous plants. This pea was used
in preparation of the German ration.
-When Mr. T. Sterling Morton was Secretary of
Agriculture he introduced this Japanese pea into this
country, and it is doubtless domesticated and being
grown in many places now. The military authorities
should hunt it up and study the preparation of a ra
tion of which it is the base in combination with pork
product. It is easier of transportation than the raw
bean and is more easily prepared and more serviceable
pn the march or during battle. This pea is especially
a heavy producer in California, and if introduced into
the army ration would be a valuable addition to our
field crops. Our fruit-growers have already asked
the Government to introduce some form of fruit ra
tion, in order to increase the market for our fruits,
and there is equal propriety in asking that such a field
crop be likewise favored.
It seems the height of folly to build refrigerators
and make ice machines part of an army equipment to
keep fresh beef in a poor condition for use in a hot
climate when the military experience of every nation
runs counter to the fresh beef ration, or the attempt
to imitate it by canned roast beef.
We fought the Civil War on the old standard ration
of hardtack and sow-belly, and that would have been
infinitely better in the Spanish war than the em
balmed abominations and refrigerated carrion on
which our soldiers were led. at great cost and with
disastrous results to the health of the troops.
NATIONAL INTEGRITY.
THE victories of our troops over the Filipinos
excite our pride and afford fresh evidence of the
superiority of American citizens over Asiatics
and additional reasons why they could never be
! brought politically together except in the relation that
I conquerors bear toward the subjugated. We bought
the title of Spain to the Philippines and stand in the
shoes of that effete monarchy while we assert our
j right of possession and our political sovereignty
j against the natives, who were fighting against Spain
I for independence when our Declaration was issued
and our Revolutionary War was in progress.
The glaring inconsistency of our present attitude
in the Philippines was logically and powerfully ex
posed by Senator Hoar in his letter recently pub
lished in The Call.
To citizens who really comprehend their own gov
| ernment, and to lovers of constitutional freedom and
| independence" everywhere, thjs bloody strife is fraught
with fearful omens. Our young men, with educated
j intelligence behind their artillery, filled with the dar
j ing courage of their composite race, handled with
I consummate skill and supplied with all the accessories
; that money can buy, like the ancient Romans are
\ practically invincible against semi-barbarians, poorly
i equipped, half naked and half starved. Under more
equal conditions they would achieve greater triumphs.
But success is not always right, and in this instance
| it is more dangerous to the conquerors than to the
j conquered. The lust for dominion is a danger signal
| not only to ourselves but to the world. As Senator
\ Hoar has suggested, the positions in our Revolution
ary War are reversed, and( while the Filipinos, now as
then, are fighting for independence, we have receded
to the attitude of Great Britain. Spain had never
colonized the Philippine archipelago, and her claim
of ownership was based upon an incomplete imperial
i robbery. That was the title we bought under which
we now call the Filipinos "rebels" or "insurgents,"
and wage against them a relentless war, in which
j their comparative loss is probably in the proportion
j of fifty to one.
There will be an end to this condition without an
j opportunity to extract from it party capital. There
! are Democratic expansionists who are the worst of
their class. There are hundreds of thousands of pa
i triotic Republicans who are opposed to Asiatic ex
' pansion, either in the form of annexation or coloni
zation. The people of the Pacific Coast arc united in
their determination to utilize their commercial and
financial advantages, but it is an insult to their intel
ligence for Eastern expansionists to pretend that for
! this purpose they are bound to support territorial
i acquisition in Asia, and to fall into the trap set by the
imperialists.
The sentiment against Asiatic expansion is rapidly
! growing and becoming solid and determined. If the
question were left to the rank and file of the army
; and navy, who are face to face with the problem in
I the Philippine Islands and are manfully upholding
| their national flag in that pestilential region, we are
! credibly informed that 98 per cent would favor an
j honorable withdrawal to our own continent as rap
i idly as the temporary responsibilities, which we have
! brought upon ourselves, could be adjusted. The in
tense advocates of expansion include the worst and
j most dangerous elements in the United States â un

labor, ambitious and reckless seekers for military
glory, toadies to Great Britain, pessimistic unbe
lievers in popular government â every class or faction
to which the constitution is a chart of worn-out sen
timents and the republic an exploded fallacy, and
whose righteousness is the Pharisaical product of
selfishness and greed. In 1859 the British blew Se
poys from their guns and scattered their remains in
order to enlist religious fear in the suppression of
mutiny. A few months ago Lord Kitchener dis
patched wounded Dervishes to arrest the fatal re
sults of their strategic courage. These acts were pos
sible under imperial government, but their imitation
in the Philippines will not be sanctioned by the citi
zens of a republic who have not abandoned the con
stitutional liberty their ancestors wrung from Great
Britain, and who have not yet surrendered their al
legiance to the memory of Washington.
THE OLNEY MOVEMENT.
A BOSTON correspondent of the Milwaukee
Journal announces that a movement is now
under way in Massachusetts to make Richard
Olney the Democratic candidate for President in
1900. It is stated somewhat curiously that he is likely
to be found an available candidate because he is in
favor of expansion but opposed to annexation, and,
while a gold Democrat, has not made himself ob
noxious to the free silver men.
There are reasons for believing strong foundations
exist for this report. The Southern States constitute
the strength of the Democratic party, and it is no
table that leading papers of that section have been
very active of late in making a campaign against
Eryanism. We have several times directed attention
tc their utterances disclosing the dissatisfaction of
Southern men with the present situation of their party
and the policy of its leaders.
For a long time the Southern papers carefully ab
stained from naming a successor to the leadership.
They were content to point out the folly of the Chi
cago platform and the weakness of Bryan as a leader.
The Richmond Times, for example, recently de
clared: "The Democratic party to-day is without
character or standing in the nation. It has lost the
confidence, if not the respect, of the great body of
intelligent, thoughtful men of the country."
The Louisville Courier-Journal has taken an even
bolder tone and has declared that the Chicago plat
form and its candidates must be abandoned. Refer
ring to the charge of "traitor" hurled by the Bryan
ites against all who would repudiate their leadership,
it says: "Is abuse a good answer to the facts of the
case? Does it hurt anybody except the authors? Who
cares for the objurgation of men with the blood of
their party upon their hands?" Then it goes on to
speak of the Democrats of the plain people, "hud
dled like sheep and ruthlessly sacrificed to the inca
pacity and the vanity of a set of politicians who have
nothing to show for their tenure of power except
obloquy and disaster."
This campaign of education having formed popu
lar sentiment, a further step was taken. The
Memphis Commercial-Appeal a shor.t time ago urged
the people of the South to take up Olney as their
candidate, and in his name seek a restoration of
Democratic unity throughout the nation. It was the
Memphis paper that first notified the country that
Mr. Olney is favorable to expansion without im
perialism, and to the gold standard without being
disrespectful to free silver.
Since the Memphis utterance the availability of
Olney has been much discussed. The Massachusetts
organ of mugwumpery, the Springfield Republican,
says: "If the Democracy wants a candidate who will
represent sound doctrine in finance, liberal views on
the income tax, helpfulness in meeting the labor
problem and a vigorous, old-fashioned Americanism
unmixed with false notions concerning Oriental ex
pansion, it can find him in Mr. Olney. The country,
too, would recognize in Mr. Olney a candidate with
plenty of fixedness of purpose and resolution."
Such are the facts of the Olney movement as they
appear on the surface. It is possible, of course, that
the newspaper campaign against Bryan in the South
may have been undertaken by the editors of their
own motion, and that the Olney canvass has been dis
cussed solely because the Memphis Commercial-
Appeal put him forward as an available candidate.
Perhaps Boston and Massachusetts had nothing what
ever to do with the matter. Chicago, however, has
recently disclosed that. the people of Boston have a
habit of catching young herring and canning them
under the name of brook trout, and it is possible
some astute men in the city have been canning Bos
ton politics of the Olney kind and putting it upon the
political market as Southern opinion.
The story that Cardinal Rampolla, Papal Secretary
of State, is exerting every effort to conceal the dan
gerous condition of the Pope with the object of pre
venting the Powers from working in advance for the
next conclave, is a very interesting contribution to
current history, inasmuch as it shows that Europeans
in matters of politics never arrange a programme be
forehand, but wait until the event happens before con
sidering what they will do next. No European power
having an interest in the papacy would presume it
seems to make a slate before the Pope is dead, and
therefore Rampolla has the game in his own hands.
The story is not only interesting, but is important â
if true.
Immediately after pronouncing them husband and
wife the priest who had wedded the high contracting
parties congratulated the bride on having become a Fair
Vanderbilt, and by thus heading off all the chappies
who intended to use that impromptu in their com
pliments, he conferred a true blessing on the couple
and earned a right to smile at the wedding breakfast.
The Cuban Military Assembly has decided to ac
cept the terms of the United States, together
with the $3,000,000, and to disband the pa
triot army and go to work. The wisdom of the
choice is commendable, but it remains to be seen how
the patriots will act after they have spent the money
and tired of work.
The President's proclamation setting apart April h
as a day for commemorating the patriot heroes who
fell in the war with Spain should be respected not by
public officials only, but by all the people. Let every
rlag be at half-mast on that day. Let every house
hold show its sympathy with the national feeling.
While the rush of congratulations is going to Mr.
Vanderbilt and his bride, it is timely to give some to
the public on the fact that we are about to have a rest
from the stories of the wedding presents and the
trousseau.
It is somewhat to be regretted that young Vander
bilt married before completing his college course,
but his wife will probably be able to superintend his
studies and finish his education for him.
For a time the volunteers serving in the Philippines
desired to return home, but now one of them writes
"The boys are no longer homesick. They feel they
are doing something."
DAWSON WATER
FRONT TENANTS
MADE TO VACATE
Holders of Leases Suffer Be=

Â»
agement,
BY SAM W. WALL.
DAWSON, March 15 (via Seattle, April
6).â The flre on the water front on Thurs
day morning, which destroyed several
more of the substantial structures built
there, caused a loss that is estimated at
$20,000, the principal sufferers being well
known San Franciscans. Mrs. Adcock's
two-story building and the entire stock,
valued altogether at $12,000, were destroy
ed. Mrs. Adcock for twenty years kept
a millinery store on Kearny street, near
Market. She and her husband barely
escaped with their lives, being aroused
from sleep in the upper story after the
house was in flames. They came in last
spring.
The small store of Mrs. Frank Fancher
'â¢ was destroyed and only a portion of the
stock saved. The loss Is about $2000.
Frank Fancher was a commissipn mer
chant in San Francisco and later was a
clerk in one of the departments at the
| City Hall. Mr. and Mrs. Fancher arrived
i in the fall of 1897.
This is the third disastrous lire on the
water front within a period of three
weeks. Commissioner Ogilvie has now
served formal notice on the tenants that
they will have to move, buildings and all,
immediately following the Ist of May. The
occupation of the water front has been
the occasion of the same confusion and
cry of corruption that have characterized
everything that has been done by warrant
of the Government in this much-muddled
I and altogether distressed country. The
I Government last year leased the water
I front to Alexander McDonald, with rights
to sublease it. The Government officials
were -changed and the present council,
I court and commissioners have given the
j tenants notice that the lease was unlaw
ful. The tenants some months ago re
fused to pay their ground rent, and the
'> ag.nts of McDonald (McDonald being now
' in the States) did not crowd them in the
j courts in the fear, it is said, that it
; might be shown they had no right to col
lect, whereupon all those who had al
ready paid would sue for recovery. A
finally got into court, however, and
was decided In McDonald's favor. Judge
Dugas holding that the tenant had no
right to question the title of a landlord
after having become a party to a lease.
This has brought greater consternation
! along the front than did the several fires
and tenants' are being levied upon ail
along the line, ejected and Bold out where
they don't promptly pay arrears, for the
tenants of the houses are responsible
t under the law .or the ground rent. In
nearly all cases the stores are not occu
pied by the owners, or at any rate ny
the holders of the ground lease. The
former have paid their rent regularly to
the lease holders, but these have not pain
and many still refuse to pay the ground
rent and much distress and embarrass
ment are suffered by the storekeepers,
who because business has been so bad
are not prepared to pay the rent a sec
ond time. They are rushing into court on
various pretexts to seek relief.
Almost the same confusion exists con
cerning the town site property. Last
summer it was stated authoritatively
that Harper. La Due and Fitzpatrick had
received their patent for the town site
land and Major Walsh, then Commis
sioner gave notice that he would support
the company with the mounted police in
keeping squatters from the land. People
who wished to build a cabin in which to
live without first buying a lot were re
quired to go tt) the hilltops, far distant
from the river and town. Now it appears
that the patent has not been issued or,
at least, the agents of the company here
do not know it if it ha? been, and are
powerless to eject the squatter once he
is fairly located. This uncertainty, of
course, frets the company and the would
be squatter as well, neither knowing his
rights .md both fighting for advantage at â¢
this formative period of the City. The
displacement of the people along the
water front will compel them, all bus
people to seek new locations on Second
avenue. Titles to vacant lots may come
into question and no end of litigation be
the result.
Lawsuits in constantly increasing num
bers are growing out of the muddled con
dition of the mining records here. Claims
hayÂ« been recorded that do not exist,
claims are discovered to be overlapping
each other, and claims are staked from
one period to another under the constant
ly being changed regulations and under
grants allowed in Ottawa that conflict
with the rights of persons already secured
under the regulations here. The confusion
and uncertainty are so great that even
the Canadians are leaving the country in
complete discouragement and disgust, and
all cry alike for the establishment of a
government hero where the laws may be
made by men familiar with the conditions
at which they are directed.
Senator Jere Lynch has just purchased
a bench claim on Adams Hill, on Bo
nanza near the mouth of El Dorado, the
consideration being something like $50,000.
Mr Lyn<!h will put a large force of men
at work with steam thawers. The claim
is thought to be very rich.

The raid on the indecent phonograph
parlors in San Francisco, made through
the efforts of The Call, is as admirable
a piece of work in behalf of morality
and a purer social atmosphere as was
the suppression of gambling at the rac

which, while advertising lotteries, make
a big blow about gambling in China

I shall start to-morrow for Eagle City

rapid tour of the principal creeks in that
and the Forty-mile district on the Amer

diggings there, and if they should develop
any reasonably good pay there will be a
hegira down the river with the breaking
of the ice. Tho reports that have reached
here through the winter from that direc
tion have been of the vaguest and most
conflicting nature. The mines are a long
distance back from the river, and those
who come out are informed only with re
gard to the immediate locality in which
they were working, some of these being
very encouraging 1 and some of them
equally discouraging stories, and neither
can be entirely credited. I have found
that the only way to get the truth is to
go after it. I have delayed the start un
til this late day in order that there may
be something definite to learn when I do
goâ that is. that the work in the mines
shall he sufficiently advanced to deter
mine what is in the ground. The trip
will cover a run of some 400 mile? over the
ice and consume about three weeks 1 time.

while ordinarily of a phlegmatic disposi

still a captain and on shore leave, he was
invited to join a party of equestrians.
During the ride Captain Kautz, whose
horsemanship was perhaps on a par with
that of most men of his profession, was
thrown and got rather a bad fall.
"He was up in a moment, and to the
anxious inquiries of his friends replied
that he was not hurt. It was evident,
however, that the captain had been badly
shaken up, but he stuck to the story that
there was nothing the matter with him.
" 'Hurt? Me hurt!' he said. 'I could
not be hurt by a fall from a horse. Why,
I have a brother who is a lieutenant col

"Captain Kautz was hurt, however, and
had to take to his bed. Some days later
he was visited by several of his friends,

had given for immunity from injury by

who t ccupied a chair to the right of the ;
to&stmaster. On the other wing was LaKe
Pence, laic of Colorado. There were oth
ers, but among them was not Mayor Phe
lan, who had promised to attend. It was
Bald that hts Honor had been obliged to
go to San Diego, for which reason he was
not present. As some of the banqueters
had seen the Mayor near the City Hall j
at 6 o'clock last evening, and as the train
ff>r Sun Diego left at a o'clock, the sus- ,
pirion arose that his Honor had another ,
reason for remaining away.
The proceedings wof? opened about 9:30
o'clock after the guests had been seated, |
when Dr. Edelman recited a short grace j
in ragtime to the accompaniment of an
orchestra of strings. He remarked that [

it was an Innovation at a Democratic ban
quet. It was received with applause, fol
lowed by a charge In phalanx on the good
things in sight and a general interchange
of political confidences that heightened
the relish of the green turtle soup, the
pates a la financiere and the "spring
chick" and put the final seal on the sim
plicity.
Late Pence, who had been associated
with that other Jeffersonian, W. \Y.
Foote, in securing during the day a suc
cessful verdict in a murder case in Oak
land, and who seriously meditated deliv
ering his unflushed argument for the de
fense as an eulogy of Magulre. was pre
vented at the last moment and was In
duced to respond to the toast, "Our Hon
ored Ouest." He spoke of his associa
tion with Maguire in Congress and eulo
fized the "Little Giant, taking, inci
cntally, occasion to remark:
"The more I study Gage, the prouder I
am that I supported Maguire. California
is a big State. It is long and wide; has
a lot of bottom and a heap of top. It is
a broad State and iÂ«hnuld not have a nar
row-gauge Governor."
Before concluding Pence welcomed Ma
guire into the "Has Beens," saying with
Governor McDonald of his own Hoosier
State that the private station was the
post of honor.
Some of Pence's hearers were inclined
to take exception to this unceremonious
relegation of their idol to the private sta
tion, but it transpired later that he
seemed to know that of which he was
talking. The guest of honor, James G.
Maguire, when he arose next to respond
to the toast, "Thomas Jefferson," fully
bore him out.
"I am pleased to-night." he said, "with
the splendid representative character of
this gathering, representing as it does the
best citizenship of the State of which I
am proud to be a citizen. Suggestion was
made by our toastmaster that some of
our political opponents have been un
necessarily concerning themselves about
the banquet. So far as my political am
bitinns are concerned, their fears may
quiet. I have no personal ambition to be a
candidate for any office now or at any
time in the future of which I have any
present thought. I believe that I can in
private life, in the private station, do
more for the cause than by being either a
date for office or the occupant of any
office to which I might aspire."
In his succeeding panegyric of Thomas
rson and the principles he enumer
ated, the speaker grew eloquent again
and again, only to be interrupted by
cheers, and concluded amid a deafening
uproar of approval.
Mr. Maguire was followed by William
H. Alforci, who responded to the toast
"The Outlook for the Future"; St-lh
Mann, who responded to "Democracy,"
and Judge E. A. Bridgford, who respond
ed to "The Financial Question in Poll

FOR MURDERING HER CHILD.
The Motion to Dismiss in the Case of
Mrs. Minnie Adams Argued
and Judgment Reserved.
The argument on the motion to dis
miss in the case of Mrs. Minnie Adams,
charged with the murder of her child,
was held before acting Police Judge Bar
ry yesterday afternoon.
Attorney Caldwell made the motion,
and contended that the prosecution had
utterly failed to prove the corpus delicti
and there was not sufficient evidence to
hold the defendant to answer before the
Superior Court. He argued that no mo
tive had been shown; that Drug Clerk
Pulenky had failed to Identify the de
fendant as the woman who purchased a
bottle of carbolic acid, and he pointed
out the difforencp In time between Police
man Herllhy and Oripman Cox as to
seeing the defendant. Tie believed that
the policeman was mistaken and that Cox
was not telling the truth, but wanted to
pose as a would-be policeman and ama
teur hawkshaw. He also paid his at
tention to Wilson Gray, the father of the
child, whom he characterized as an apol
ogy for a man.
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter replied
briefly and logically. He contended that
th<=> corpus delicti had been proved cir
cumstantially and inferential!}-, and a
motive had been shown in the very fact
that the child was the outcome of illicit
relations between Orav and the mother.
He contended that sufficient evidence had
been adduced to hold the defendant
Attorney Sweeney replied for the 'de
fendant, and the Judge said he would
reserve his decision till next Thursday
$50,000 Insurance Wanted on a Jer
sey Bull.
Application has been made for insur
ance of 550.000 on the famous young Jer
sey bull, Merry Maiden's Son. owned at
Hood farm. I^nwell, Mass. This is the
highest amount of insurance ever astced
for on a hull or cow. Merry Maiden's
Son Is believed to be the irwst famous
Jersey bull living, as he is the son of
Merry Maiden, the champion sweep
stakes cow In all three tests combined
at the World's Fair, and his Fire is Brown
Bessie's Son. whose dam won the 90 days'
and 30 days' tests at the World's Fair
Thus Merry Maiden's Son unites the
blood of these two famous cows and
great results are expected from his
progeny.

on a sightseeing trip.
They were flrht driven through the prin
cipal streets of the city, the Mayor point
ing out the prominent buildings and 'other
places of note. After that the party was

NOT SATISFIED
WITH THE ODD
FELLOWS' HOME
Two Reports as to Its
Condition.
ITS REMOVAL IS URGED
THE GRAND LODGE IS ASKED
TO ACT.
Division of Opinion in Belation to
Soil and Climateâ A Sugges
tion to Sell the
Place.
At the session of the Grand Lodge of
the Independent Order of Odd Fellows
held in this city in 1598 Daniel Flint
(chairman), Samuel F. Smith and J. J.
Loggie were appointed a committee by
the grand master to report on the condi
tion of the Odd Fellows' Home at Ther
mallto and make such recommendations
as it deemed necessary.
The committee has performed its labor
and will present two reports to the Grand
Lodge next month, for the committee is
divided. The majority will be with Smith
and Loggie and the other with Chairman
Flint.
Both reports go into details as to the
home, the land upon which it is located,
the climate, the improvements that have
been made, and each makes suggestions.
The majority says:
The soil of the uplands (all except twenty
five acres In the river bottom) is a red clay,
interspersed and underlaid with gravel; it
varies from twelve inches to twenty-four
inches in depth, is non-productive and
sterile, being deficient In lime, potash and
phosphoric add; it is not adapted to or
suitable for general farming purposes or the
raising of hay, grain, deciduous fruits,
berries or vegetables, and cannot be suc
cessfully used for the growing of those
things most needed at th* home, without
being strengthened by the addition of strong
fertilizer?, and loosened by being mixed
with large quantities of sand.
According to instructions received from
Professor Hilgard samples of the soil
were sent him, and after examination ha
wrote to Past Grand George H. Morrison:
It is certainly not a desirable tract to lo
cate an agricultural colony on, or any insti
tution that desires to gTOW Its own supply
of vegetables.
I should add that I have seen much bet
ter soil samples from Thermalito Colony,
and was not aware that any portion of it
was so little adapted to agricultural use as
ll indicated by the samoles sent.
As to climate, the report says that "it
is hot and dry in summer and cold and
dry in winter, the thermometer ranging
from 26 degrees Fahrenheit in winter to
112 in summer." There is also consider
able malaria and the majority report
says that "we cannot otherwise report
than that the home is located in a mala
rious district and one which is, for that
reason, not adapted for a home for aged
brothers." There is also some complaint
as to distance and cost of transportation,
which is $9 for the round trip from San
Francisco. The conclusions of the ma
jority are:
Firstâ That It should be a healthful loca
tion.
Secondâ That the location and soil should
be guch that all the vegetables, fruits, ber
ries, hay, grain and other produce required
by the institution might be raised at the
home, with the help of the inmates there
of, thus reducing the expense to a mini
mum.
Neither of these requirements is realized
at the home at Thermallto. Malaria is
prevalent to such an extent as to make the
home an undesirable and unsuitable place
01 residence, and the soil is of suuh a na
ture that It Is not adapted for the raising
of those thlnes most needed at the home,
and can be made so only by a larger ex
penditure of money than would be Justified
under the circumstances. Were the home
located un a farm with a fertile and pro
ductive soil, with the labor of the inmates
who are willing, able and anxious to work,
devoted to the raising of vegetables, fruits,
berries hay, grain, chickens, cattle, hogs,
etc., most. If not all, of such things netded
could be raised on the premises, thus reduc
ing- the cost of maintenance from one-half
to two-thirds of its present cost, and under
such conditions it is even probable that suf
ficient surplus produce could be raised to
make a home practically self-supporting,
or If not -wholly self-sustaining, requiring
but little assistance from the Grand Lodge.
Such a location can be obtained at such a
price that it will be true economy to aban
don the present location and to secure a
new one adapted to our needs.
The majority recommends that no more
lands be purchased at the present site;
that no more money be used in making
improvements on tne present holdings;
that the purchased lands be put on the
market and the proceeds be placed in a
"home fund," with which to purchase a
new site; that the trustees enter into
negotiation? with the donors of the prop
erty whereby the property may be sold,
it riot, to rent the property to the best ad
vantage after a new home shall have been
secured; that a small annual per capita
tax be collected from the jurisdiction to
be added to the home fund to purchase a
site when the fund shall amount to $20,000.
and when another $20,000 shall be raised
either by surplus after purchase of site
or otherwise to erect a new home on the
site; that pending the establishment of a
new home the sanitary conditions be im
proved and shade trees be planted, and
that the orchard be fertilized to make it
more salable.
The minority of the committee has a
different opinion as to the soil and ex
presses the opinion that "it responds lib
erally to a dressing of manure and a lib
eral supply of water." He does not think
that the trustees made a good business
stroke in purchasing certain lands near
the home and suggests that they be dis
posed of at the earliest opportunity. He
does not agree with the majority as to
malaria, for he says:
Borne of the members, high up in author
ity, have stated that It was criminal to
keep the home at such a malarious place as
Thermalito. It hardly seems that a person
with cool judgment and an' investigating
turn of mind would make such a rash
statement. "We have to admit that there is
more or less malaria in every county of ths
State, and in certain climates and under
certain conditions It develops sooner and
more severely than in other*. From the high
elevation of the home, on the bluff, eighty
feet above the river, it would hardly seem
that malaria could maintain its existence
amid the gentle breezes that waft the
fragrance from the orchards of the lemon,
orange and olive.
In conclusion the minority says:
After receiving the munificent gift that
the home has from the colony, and the kind
feelings manifested and expressed from the
citizens of Oroville, the amount that ha*
been spent by the order in fitting up the
â  buildings and Improving the premises, and
making things attractive, convenient and
homelike, we say. fully holding ourselves
for the responsibility of this report. it
would be the height of folly and unbusiness
like methods to attempt its removal at pres
ent. I --â 
We cannot urge too -strongly upon the
grand lodge the duty of electing trustees,
and the trustees a superintendent, that v. ill
apply strictly business methods, and fully
in sympathy with the .home and its loca
tion. Every movement, purchase and Im
provement should look well to the future.
Thesf> reports will cause a lengthy and
exciiing debate during the grand session,
fnr th<* representatives of the 30.000 Odd
Fellows in the State are about evenly di
vided on the subject of the home, which
has already cost the order $37,526.

THE BULL AND THE SERGEANT.
A Bovine From Stockton Makes
Trouble on the Water Front.
When the Stockton steamer landed at
Clay street wharf yesterday among her
cargo' was a Hereford bull which was
labeled dangerous. A board was hung
from its horns In front of Its eyes, and to
this fact Sergeant Tom Mahoney and
Johnny ("Rats") Burns owe their escape
.from serious Injuries. The b_u.H ,was bejy^
led off the wharf and when in front of the
chief wharfinger's office made its escape.
It caught sight of Burns from under the
board and charged. Johnny escaped by
taking refuge under his express wagon.
The animal then saw Sergeant Mahoney
and charged again. The police officer
quickly put a telegraph pole between him
and the infuriated brute. Then began a
pretty game of tag, and the sergeant was
kept dodging around that pole until his
collar was wilted and the perspiration
was pouring eff him. Penally the bull was
lassoed and tied vp behind a wagon so
that it could do no more damage. The
sergeant and Johnnny "Rats" will not
forget yesterday's experience in a hurry.
Captain Paul Pohl of the Piper. Aden,
Goodall Company's schooner Brothers
wants the owner for a carrier pigeon with i
the tag W 565 on its leg. Yesterday the
Brothers was sailing down San Pablo !
Bay when Captain Pohl saw a hawk |
chasing a pigeon. The latter flew for the '
I schooner, but before It could reach safety
; the hawk struck it. Both birds fell, and |
! had they struck the deck would have been
instantly killed. They struck tho main
! sail, however, and thnt broke tho'r fall.
i Captain Pohl seized the pigeon and the I
! ship's dog tackled the hawk. The bird i
| made the dos's fur fly and soon drove him j
off. after which it flew away. The pigeon !
| was wounded around the neck, but in a i
' few minutes recovered and is now as
well as ever.
A QUIET WEDDING
AT THE COLONIAL
Mrs. Bell SpafTord was very quietly mar
ried ypsterday afternoonin her apartments
at the Hotel Colonial to R. W. Wellington,
a railroad contractor of Chicago. The
ceremony was performed by the Rev.
Robert Mackenzie, in the presence of the
bride's two daughters and one or two
intimate friends.
The details of the wedding were so
quietly arranged that the utmost seoercy
was preserved up to the very hour of the j
ceremony.
Mr. and Mrs. Wellington left on the
afternoon train for Santa Cruz, where
Mrs. Wellington has a charming home.
They will spend two weeks there and then
go to Chicago to reside.
Chinatown Gamblers.
When the cases of thirty Chinese ar
rested by Lieutenant Esola and posse at
Washington street and "Waverley place
were called In Judge Mogan's court yes
terday the lieutenant did not appear, but
sent Sergeant Christiajisen, who asked
for a continuance till to-morrow. The
continuance was granted, but Attorney
Coffey, who appeared for the defendants,
made a demand for the return of the
J4750 illegally seized by the police at th<?
time of the raid. The Judge said he
would render a decision on the matter
to-day. The five Chinese arrested by
Lieutenant Price and posse for visiting
an opium "joint" were convicted by Judge
Mogan yesterday and ordered to appear
for sentence this mornlnp.

CANNED GOODS IN NEW YORK.
The New York Commercial says:
"There Is a substantial agreement among
ranned goods men that the outlook for the
business was never better. With practically
the entire country prosperous ar.d the prob
abilities bright that it will remain so for years
to come, there is no reason why all canned
goods men should not reap a substantial re
ward for their efforts. Trie only drawback is
the higher price of can manufacturers' mate
rials and the uncertainty as to what turn
prices will take in the future. The sale of fu
tures was ntver so heavy as It has been so far
this season, and the sale of the bulk of the
fruits and most of the fish is yet to come
"It is said that there have been liberal
sales of salmon at prices to be made in the
future. Some of the contracts are made for
positive delivery, but a good many have a
t-.ifety tiause which packers are in
fcertlng wherever possible to save themselves
from such expensive experiences as they had
last year. The outlook for a. large pack is not
encouraging. Not only is the prospect for a
email run of fish, but the cold storage men are
mnkir.R considerable purchases, which will re
duce the number to be sold to packers. The
rnce asked for fish by some of the fishermen
is almost' fabulous, and it is difficult to see
where packers can make a profit. Spot sup
plies are closely cleaned up. It there was any
cheap stuff obtainable it would go at remark
ably good prices for under grades, but the
supply on hand is comparatively short and is
sa:d to be controlled by holders who have
agreed to hold quotations up to the present
nark.
"sardir.es re steady at present, â with ad
vancing tendency noted. There is a probabil
ity that there will be another advance as soon
a? the syndicate actually set the canneries
into their control. Some holders . â â¢â¢ asking $3
already, but the inside figure is about $2 TO
(1/2 75. All who have paid any attention to the
subject insist that the next move will be up
to id.
"Oysters are high, ar.d the quantity avail
able is smaller than usual, though the exact
extent of the reduction is at present uncertain.
It is said that prices will rule high during the
season. The shortage was caused by the cold
weather, which prevented thing when it was
time.
"Lobster is almost unobtainable. There will
be no lower prices on best grades and trade is
quite likely to be restricted by the quotations
now prevailing."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 6.â Stock prices started
badly â¢ lay and eloped weak at the
lowest. CroD advices 'were unfavorable and
these were given color by the advance in
wheat, but â¢he principal cause for the shaking
Of confidence was a renewal of stringency on
the call money market. Discrimination In
loans in certain industrials and specialties
made some brokers disinclined to carry mar
ginal accounts for some of these properties.
This attitude was taken advantage of by the
bear contingent and promiscuous selling of the
general laity group followed. Among the
more conspicuous breaks were Brooklyn Tran

parently, only to afford a new level from which
to let go stocks. The recent continued advance
In many mocks, which eliminated much of the
ehort interest.-, ide the decline rapid as there
was no support from this quarter. Many stop
loss orders were uncovered, thus accelerating
the decline. London early purchased about as
much as it sold yesterday, but the market
there followed local quotations so nearly
that early trade business ceased. There was
much money borrowed early on call- around 6
and S per cent on. railways, but 2 per cent or
more in addition was exacted on Industrial
collateral, and 12 rer cent for call loans was
reached at times during the day. Before the
close money was offered down from S to 4 per
cent on railroad collateral after more urgent re
quirements tor the money had been met but
later loans wfremade at 6 per cent. The con
tinued .high rates for money had not
brought as much money from outside
points as expected. Boston, however loaned"
some money in New York to-day. The demand
for money for interest and dividend payment
together with the recurrent necessity of financ

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. April âThe Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were extremely idle to-day
and the tone was dull. The American market
was merely nominal. It opened at par and
then improved a trifle. New York bought
slightly, but the close was reactionary. New
York bought mainly Mexican Central, but the
Morgans deny the story of a deal. Tintos
were 41%; Anacondas, 8%. Money was in fair
supply on a release of the Government divi

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 6 âThe wheat market was
exceedingly nervous and uncertain. Milder
weather and somewhat lower Liverpool cables
caused some liquidation at the start and a
consequent decline. The sellers were soon
bailed out, however, and as soon as the sell
| Ing preprur^ was removed, the market had a
â  rapid recovery on buying orders from traders
who had further crop damage news from the
country. May opened KO%c lower at from
72*4 C down to 72*Â»c. and after rising to 73c
without any wild stirring of the contending
forces, the price shot suddenly up to 73 e nc.
i July was responsive to the buying on crop
damagt complaints, but for the time being did
not get above 73Sc The price of May gradu
ally receded to around 73c. and then occurred
a struggle among some large scalpers to see
â¢wtio could unload fastest. The selling result
ed in a sudden collapse to 72^c for both May
"and July. Then a recovery set in that was
: about as sudden as th? slump had been. July
was the leader on the second rally, going to
iHe premium for a time. Everything gave
I place to the influence of the shoals of sen
sationally bad crop reports that came from
all directions.
From Nebraska "total ruin" was the cry
from many sections, and Kansas was not :ar
behind, the exception being a report of less
than 50 per cent damage. Many claimed the
lotses to be 75 per cent. The feeling of opera
tion to an advance was not allayed, however
Every advance brought out free offerings from
the local talent which the market was not
broad enough to absorb without yielding tem
porarily. Atlantic port clearances were equal
in wheat and flour to 210,000 bushels. As the
crowd had loaded up on every bulge, the bur
den became too heavy near the end and they
were compelled to drop some of It as tho
session approached the close. May reachei
735;!g73*,c on one of Its upward stretches, and
twice it dropped to 72** c and recovered again
to over 73c. .but finally rested at 72% c. July
closed 'ie higher than May at ~2\r.
a was sluggish and disinclined to ad
vance even when wheat was in a bullish mood
Trading was only on a moderate scale and
chiefly for local account. May corn closed
unchanged.
OATSâ brisk demand from the country was
the main feature. There was a weak spot
early, but the loss was soon regained when
buying orders began to come In. and on re
ports of the backward season. May oats closed
He highey
Lower prices for hogs at the yard started
provisions lower. There was a feeble rally
later on some covering â¢of pork. â¢ May pork

â  Of yesterday's liberal receipts of 648 tons of
Hay the greater part was Alfalfa from the
river and several cars from Nevada and the
North.' The Alfalfa was demoralized, as sup
plies are altogether too heavy, but grain Hay
is in moderate receipt and steady.
Bran and Middlings were unchanged.

BUTTER, CHEESE AND EGGS.
There Is no change in Butter except more
weakness in dairy descriptions. Cheese Is easy
I and unchanged.
The comparative scarcity in Eggs is causing
surprise among the trade, who are unable to
account for it only on the theory that owing to
] the scarcity of feed last year poultry raisers
diminished the product of Incubators and thus
cut down the supply of Hens this year. i
Whether this is true or not the Egg supply of â 
California is certainly not up to normal pro- i
portions this >*ear. and the market is steadily |
advancing in consequence. However, supplies !
r of Eastern are on the way and may affect the
J market next week.

In spite of the pumping operations on the
Comstock the mining stock market is steadily
shrinking, though the daily decline Is slight.
Yesterday's telegram from the pump said: "We
shut down the elevator for three hours last
night. The water rose 21 feet. At 6:30 this
morning the water was within 10 feet of the
lowest point reached, or 132 feet below .the
1750-foot level and 158 feet below the Sutru
drain boxes. We will run the elevator only
long enough to keep the water to about ch-s
point until the water is drained from the Bo
nanza stopes. The water was going down slow
ly at all points when measured. The elevator is
running quite steadily."
An assessment of 20 cents per share has been

leers of the black horse, Ostler Joe,
played in hard luck at Oakland track yes
terday. Tt was the black's first appear
ance in a race since November 22 last, and
In the fourth race on the card, a seven
furlm-.e run, he seemed to have fallen into
p. soft spot. The play on the Corrigan or
Carrol] entry, Daisy F. was so heavy that
the ring laid 7 to 10 against Joe at post
call. Mr. Caldwell paid no more attention
to the favorite than if he had been a post
In the fence, sending the field off with him
turned sideways. But Daisy F did not
win after all. Jingle Jingle, aSO to 1 shot,
resurrected from the dead, made all the
running and on in a gallop. Daisy suc
Â«.^eded in beating Be Happy for the place.
The entire programme wore a smlrchy,
smoky look, and th. attendance was lim
ited. Two choices only were successful.
Ezell's gelding, Kamsin, went to the
post favorite for the six furlong sprint
that opened the afternoon's racing, and
finished third. The 25 to 1 shot. Alumi
num, led until within a few yards of the
wire, where McNUhols on Malay got up
in time to win by a nose. Rev Hooker,
with Macklin up. ran a very peculiar race.
The Corrigan fllly; Basseda, had another
pleasant outing in the two-year-old
scramble. She was an 11 to 20 choice and
won easily from Tar Hill. Burdock fin
ished third, beaten but a head.
Lady Meddlesome was touted about as
the good thing f<>r the third event at Fix
furlongs. It was her first start of the
season, but the ring took no liberties with
Blakel^y's filly, laying but 6 to 6 about
her. Jonos. who had the mount, was
away first, and never headed, disposed of
Alaria at the end without half trying.
Yaruba, a 20 to 1 shot, landed in the show.
Jnnrs also piloted the winner of the
second six furlong dash. He beat the
gate with Prompto, a 4 to 1 chance, and
was never overhauled. Highland Ball
took the place from the weakly ridden
favorite. Opponent.
A heavy plunge was made on Hugh
Penny in the closing mile and a sixteenth
Felling affair. The old horse led to the
paddock, and was there passed by both
Joe I'llman and Merops, the former win
ning by a head in 1:48 flat.

longs covered in slow time. Yesterday
she won galloping at seven furlongs. At
odds, of 3 to 1 the filly was a dog, but
when 30 to 1 was chalked up she proved
a "Hindoo." The trainer was there after
the race with the old threadbare story of
"going broke" on her the day she lost.
And it went.
It is said McNichols Is quite a bettor.
If he is, and wins, ho would confer a
great favor on the public by publishing
his system. Everybody that ever followed
the custom of backing his mounts is now
either digging clams for a living or con
fined in an asylum. Some say this
sprightly youth plays his mounts to show.
If he does, then he uses the "copper"
frequently, for many of them do not
show.
Mr. Caldwell's eyesight is failing; he
should visit an oculist. On Wednesday he
did not see Kitty Kelly standing up at
the barrier when she beat the others
away, and he probably overlooked Ostler
Joe yesterday. It is a rare joke for peo
ple to sea their coin burned up on a 3 to 5
shot that is left, and the white-haired
starter may enjoy funny things himself.
For a few days it seemed as if Macklin
could land horses with any old price
quoted against them in front. Now he
seems unable to finish inside the money
on a 2 to 1 chance. The same old story
of supply and demand.
Jones rode Lady Meddlesome as If he
had nothing to beat but an acre of tomb
stones in a country graveyard. Some of
those behind him must have been awfully
sick.

THE SA3S FRANCISCO CAMj, FBIDAT, APRIL. 7, 1899.
WATSON WILL MAKE A
VERY GOOD REFEREE
Charaeteristie Poses of the Fighters
Who Meet To-Night.
SPEAKING of the twenty-round contest between Green and Smith, which
will take place this evening the referee, Walter Watson, who has been
for many years boxing instructor of the Olympic Club, Baid: "This
will be the first time since my arrival In this city that I have con
sented to referee a boxing match, but with the knowledge I possess of the
honesty of the men who will box on Friday nipht I am satisfied that the
contest will not be a difficult one to referee. Should I detect, however, the
least symptom of hippodrome in an y round of the contest, I shall cer
tainly order the contestants out of the ring and declare the bout a no con
test, which will mean the declaring off of all bets. I am fully satisfied, how
ever, that dreen and Smith will fight a straightforward battle, and that the
public will be pleased with the entertainment."
As there will be only one preliminary bout before the Hon. William Jor
dan, the grand master of fistic ceremonies and director general of saus
ages and divers kinds of meats, will mount the rostrum to announce the
event of the evening and the great necessity for a non-polluted atmosphere,
etc.. It Is presumed that the entertaininment will end earlier than usual.
The fighters will weigh in this afternoon. Green is now 153 pounds and
Smith 147 pounds. The betting is still in favor of Smith; the odds last even
ing were 10 to 6^. with Smith in the lead. Should the mysterious pugilist
defeat Green he will be challenged by Tommy Ryan and Joe Wolcott.
LEAGUE BABIES
ARE GETTING
ALONG NICELY
Watsonville in First
Position.
If anybody doubts the quality of base
ball that lias been served to the public
at home or in the other league towns
since the season opened let him study the
work of the various teams and become
convinced that not even the National
League has ever opened a season with
such a high class article by all the teams.
Local cranks have seen all three games
the home team has played, and notwith
standing the great work It did In all of
them, it lost two out of the three and Is
now at The foot of the column, while
"Watsonvllle, the baby team of the league.
Is at the head with two out >of three
games to its credit. Oakland, Sacramen
to, San Jose and Santa Cruz have each
broken even on two games played. With
a continuance of such ball playing the
Eighth-street grounds will not begin to
accommodate the crowds later in the sea
son. Following is the percentage of the
teams, including last Sunday's games:

Jack Sheridan, the old-time California
League umpire, will be with the Western
League agnln this season.
Iburg, the change pitcher for Frisco,
has entirely recovered from the injury to
his eye caused by a ball striking him
while practicing two days before the
opening of the season, and he will go in
the box for one of the games at Watson
ville this week.
Sacramento Is In great luck In having
secured Meaney permanently. The clever
center fielder was- to go to Newark, N. J.,
this season, but he claims the manage
ment of that team forfeited all right to
his services. Under the National agree
ment all clubs reserving players must
Bend the men a contract not later than
March 1. Newark neglected to forward
Meaney's contract until March 10, there
by invalidating its title to his services.
When it was announced that Hughes
was to pitch last Sunday for Sacramento
1.,<-al cranks of sporting proclivities fig
ured it out that tho Capital Citys had a
2 to 1 <ln<h on tho game and backed their
opinion with their coin. Now they are
sorry that they pinned so much faith in
the National League.
Manager Cripps of Sacramento said last
Sunday that hÂ«' put Hughes into the game
;^e the public demanded drawing
cards, and, moreover, because the Cali
fornia League was not a member of the
National Agreement; that if it was he
would not play under it. Mr. Cripps is
right, with some exceptions. The public
does demand drawing cards â which
Hughes evidently Is notâ but it will not
t . "ringers." Players in regular
League games must be members of the
team with which they play or eligible to
become members or interest in the game
!s destroyed. There has been too much
of patching up teams horr- with National
League players temporarily at liberty,
and the "people have become tired of it.
Again, Cripps' assertion that the Cali
fornia League Is not a member of the
National Agreement Is at variance with
the statements of all the other managers
and If he is right the sooner the league
becomes a member the better it will be
for baseball h^re, even though it were to
result in Manager Cripps withdrawing
from the game. There are others who
would be only too glad to take hold of
the Sacramento club.
San Jose has been somewhat crippled,
owing to the illness of its shortstop,
O'Dea. He Is Improving:, however, and is i
expected to participate in the games thia
week.
It was thought that Watsonville would
have to place its main dependence on j
Harper in the delivery department, but
"old reliable" seems to have a side part- |
ncr in Whelan, who is fully capable of
wrapping up the goods and sending them
home promptly.
The Sacramentos were somewhat han
dicapped in Sunday's game owing to the
illness of tht-ir regular shortstop, L.ock
head. Sheehan, although an exceedingly
clever second baseman, is a comparative
novice, and it was an injustice to him,
though unavoidable, to shift him over to
short. Ho is a great youngster, though,
and promises to make the veterans
scratch gravel before the season Is many
months old. Another "find" for Sacra
mento is "Kid" Reitz, who bears a strik
ing resemblance to his brother Hank,
and handles himself much the same as
does tho elder Reitz.
Harvey, who is at present in the care
of a physician, will sign with Sacramento
as soon as he is able to get into the
game. The champions will then be com
plete.
San Francisco had Russell in uniform
last Sunday, intending to put him in the
box, but Fitzpatrick was so anxious to
go In again against Sacramento that
Harris consented. Fitz's work was ex
traordinary, considering the fact that he
had pitched fourteen innings of almost
flawless ball the day before, and that
after fighting fire all the previous night.
Fitzpatrick seems to be like Chief
Borchers in his palmy days; the mort
he works the better he performs.
There will be a meeting of the league
directors early next week to act upon the
Snn Francisco-Sacramento protest, and
alto to settle up some minor affairs.
Bill Clarke, who made a hit here some
years ago while catching for San Jose
and later on caught for the champion
Baltimores, has been sold to Boston.
Oakland looks to have the fastest
Infield in the league. It seems to be a
trillo weak in the pitching department
compared with the other teams, but with
its heavy batters this weakness promises
to be fully offset.
The report that Chance has been signed
by Milwaukee is an error. The Callfor
nian will be a regular member of the
Chicago team.
Lange and Ryan are both aspirants for
the captaincy of the Chicagos, which pos
tion carries with it increased salary and
much glory should tho team finish near
the top.
I>alrymple of San Jose created quite a
disturbance during last Sunday's game
by disputing a decision of Umpire Levy.
Such tactics should not be tolerated, and
Dalrymple will find himself relegated to
the bench if he continue! his tactics.
The facilities for reaching the Santa
Cruz grounds are meager, and as the
grounds are located on the beach a long
distance from the center of the town it
naturally affects the attendance. Man
ager Tuttle ought to induce the street
railroad company to buy another mule
and charter a narrow-gauge boxcar for
the convenience of patrons on ball days.
Hammond, Oakland's second baseman,
gives every promise of developing into a
!i rat-class man. He is new to the pro
fessional game yet and shows signs of
nervousness, which will wear off when
he becomes accustomed to large crowds.
The ball that cai'sed so much dispute
last Sunday at Reservation Park was
somewhat f*oft and consequently could
not be batted far, but the rules provide
that a ball shall be kept in play as long
as the cover is not ripped or torn or the
ball loses its shape.
The members of the local team are de
lighted over the ?trong partisan feeling
already developed among Recreation
Park patrons. This is entirely new to
San Francisco ball patrons, for heretofore
the cranks have shown no marked pref
erence for the home team but have di
vided their expressions of approval
among them all. This partisanship will
tend to encourage the boys wonderfully.
Baseball teajnÃ are being organized in
many of the leading wholesale houses
and a strong strictly amateur league will
soon be established. The deputies in the
Assessor's and County Clerk's offices
have aJso organized teamÃ, and already
there is a kick over Josh Riley, who is
employed in the Assessor's office. The
Assessors want to play Josh, but the
County Clerks protest on the ground that
he is a professional. The dispute will
be settled this week.
Krug seems to be in company that Is
traveling a trifle faster than ne ever went
before. In other words, while the other
players who were hero last season have
speeded up, Krug apparently has not
fallen into the 'new gait.
The home team makes its first trip
away fmm home this week, playing at
Watsonvtlle Saturday and Sunday. San
Jose will meet Oakland at Recreation
Park, while Santa Cruz will Journey to
Sacramento.
The Oakland grounds are. not completed
yet. although work is progressing on them
rapidly. Manager Ewlng expects to play
the first Sunday morning game on them
the 23d of this month. After that there
will be a regular league game in Oakland
every Sunday forenoon by the teams that
are scheduled to play here in the after
noon.
The first of the Intercollegiate games
between Stanford and Berkeley will be
played at the Sixteenth and Folsom-street
grounds next Saturday. There is great
interest in these games and the students
put up almost as good ball as the profes
sionals.
It peems odd to see "Tip" O'Neil in a
San Francisco uniform after all the years
he has played with Oakland. Time was
when "Tip" and Harris did not get along
comfortably, but Hank is not slow in rec
ognizing a good man, and he made no
mistake in signing O'Neil. In addition to
knowing every point of the game and
being able to take advantage of it in
stantly, "Tip" is a good business man,
and any time Hank finds it inconvenient
to go away with the team he will know
that under "Tip's" charge perfect dis
cipline will be maintained and the busi
ness end competently handled. 1

CONVICTED OF
BREAKING HIS
GIRL'S THIGH
Drink Caused Fay to
Be Cruel.
A WIFE'S UNHAPPY TALE
FIFTEEN TEARS OF MIXED EX
PERIENCE.
Little Laura Ate a Piece of Cake,
Told a Lie and Was Beaten
by Her Drunken
Father.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 6.
Charles H. Fay was convicted to-day by
a jury in Judge Quinn'a court for cruelly
beating his 13-year-old daughter. Laura
Fay'p crime consisted of eating a piece of
Easter cake to which she had helped her
self.
In giving her testimony to-day the- girl
did not seem desirous that her father
should bt- punished for his cruelty. She
seemed anxious to tell the truth, but not
enough of It to hurt her parents, and
Judge Quinn did not insist on her testi
mony.
ATTORNEY W. W. FOOTE CONGRATULATES MRS. MENTEL.
Deputy Marshal Rawson told of the girl
running to his house suffering severely
from being beaten. He said that the back
of the girl's nr-ck and arms were all
bruise*, ami between her shoulders tljere
were some bruises and also the skin w;us
lacerated. Hawson gave some damaging
evidence.
Town Marshal IJo i- d alpo testified as
to the condition of the girl on the even-
Ing of the beating, and said she was so
frightened tha.t she stayed with his fam
ily all night.
Dr. A de Marconnay, who dressed the
girl's wounds, said that non<* of them were
is, though a green stick fracture of
the girl's left thjg-h would cause her con
siderable trouble a-nd take some weeks to
heal. He did no* think the lwnes would
have been fracture*! by an ordinary strap.
The defendant, who conducted his own
case, did not make a very "ood start on
his defense, ile called for a witness his
neighbor, W. B. Pickett. and about all
that Mr. Piokett said was that Fay bore
the reputation o-f oeing a very quarrel
some man. Mrs. Fay then told her story
of unhapplnetss. For fifteen years she has
been the wife of Fay. Part of this time
they have lived happily and part unhap
pily. Drink causes all their troubles,
when Fay Is not drunk he is all right.
Bhe waa not at home at the time of the
beating, and only Knew what the children
told her.
Fay put himself on the stand. He said
that they ha/1 a cake in the house to be
eaten on Easter Sunday. Laura ate some
of it and denied doing so, even though
some of the crumbs were still on her lips.
The defendant excused the severe beating
by saying that he had no Intention of be
ing cruel, but that he punished her for
lying to him. He said he had eaten noth
ing all that day. and when he took a glass
of whisky it went straight to his head.
He cnnf' c se<l to the habit of drinking too
much, and said he was not sober at the
time of the boating, but was very angry.
The jury, after an hour's consideration,
found the defendant guilty but recom
mended him to the extreme mercy of the
court because of the provocation his
3aughter had given. He will be sentenced
to-morrcw morning.
HOW THE WOMAN
WITH THE HOE
GAKLAND, April 6.â The feminine counterpart of Charles Edward 'â 
Marknam's "Man With a Hoe" was developed In Superior Judge
Ellsworth's court this afternoon at the trial of the divorce suit of 'â 
Christina Xeilson-Kirchofer against Gustaf Kirchofer, on the grounds i
of cruelty and failure to provide. The parties were married in Ala- ,
meda April 20, 1897, and the fruit of the marriage ia a bright little â 
girl with golden tresses.
The fair plaintiff, a buxom young woman of twenty-eight summers, with â 
hazel brown eyes, took the witness stand this afternoon and testified that im- i
mediately after becoming the bride of her Switzerland lover they removed to <
Mendocino County, where defendant owned 160 acres of timber land.
"One month after we were married," continued Mrs. Kirchofer, "my
husband compelled me to work in the woods with him, sawing down trees
and chopping wood. As soon as we had several acres cleared we planted
potatoes, and then he mada me take a hoe and work in the patch. We lived
in a little two-room cabin, but there was no bed provided, and we slept on
the floor. For a long time our principal food consisted of beans mixed and
baked with flour.
"It was too much for me, and I soon suffered from hemorrhages of the
lungs. Then people fn>m a nf4ghl>oring claim brought me food, and they
finally removed me back to Alameda, where I have since resided. The clothes !
on my baby's back were donated by friends. My husband is an able-bodied
man, with sufficient means to provide for us. His ranch Is worth $2000. It
contains now 275 fruit trees, and in all twenty acres are plantod. The re
maining 140 acres contain redwood, pine and oak timber, and once my hus
band was offered $2 75 per cord for the tanbark." :
Her attorney, Carltnn W. Greene, also called other witnesses to cor
roborate her testimony, which in the main they did, and the trial will prob
ably close to-morrow.
HER SIMPLE
STORY SECURED
HER ACQUITTAL
Anna Mentel Was
Justified.
SHOT IN SELF DEFENSE
TRIAL FOR MURDER SOON CW
CLTTDED.
After She Was Betrayed by Her Hus
band She Took His Life in
Order to Save
Her Own.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 6.
Anna Mentel is not a murderess. She
did right when she shot her unnatural
husband on the pTreets of Alameda last
December. This afternoon the jury justi
fied her action, convinced by her simple
story of th<' tragedy, told between her
sobF and under the guidance of W. W.
Foote. one of her attorneys.
It was one of the quickest of trials.
Compared with the tedious Brandes case
it was phenomenally quick. There was
not a single challenge of a juror for
cause, not a word of cross-examination
of the witnesses for the defense, not a
single objection made or exception taken,
not a word of argument from either side,
not a single written Instruction handed to
the court. There was proof offered that
a man had been killed, the explanation of
the young woman who tired the pistol
and the verdict; nothing more.
The verdict was tiot a surprise. Since
the story of the tragedy was first told by
Anna Mentel in tile Receiving Hospital
â no one expected a conviction. On the
; fatal night, while the doctors were re
i dressing the wounds in her head through
which she had fired the bullet that she
: hoped would end her life, she confessed
to her unhappy secret marriage and the
; result, and she repeated the facts to the
jury this morning.
"When court opened Attorney Foote
! made a short address to the jury. il<?
said the defense would- prove that Anna
Mf-ntel was a good, home-loving girl and
i that until she became Infatuated with the
! deceased her life was innocent and guile
' less. Under a promise of marriage a
: smooth villain wrecked her life and then
; he hesitated to carry out his promise. He
forced her to consent to illegal methods
to conceal the wrong he had done and
thus added murder to his perfidy. This
man entered Into the solemn covenant of
marriage with no Intention of keeping it,
i and shortly afterward he took steps to
desert his young wife and go East. He
repudiated the marriage and heaped the
bitterest humiliation upon hiE wire until
she in a moment of anger, smarting from
his blows, weak from his cruelty .md
mentally unbalanced from his persistent
cowardice, undertook to defend herself.
' Outraged humanity asserted itself, Mentel
fell and the young girl tried to end her
existence.
| The defense then placed Deputy County
C'lcrk Shvlue of San Jose on the slam!.
He It was who issued the marriage license
to Mentel. He told of Mentel's anxiety
to have the matter kept secret, because
he intended to skip out and desert the
girl.
The story that removed the cloud that
THE SAIS FEAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 7, 1899.
has hung over Anna Mentel for four
months did not take lons in the telling.
] la-1 not the tears flowed so freely it could
have been told in ten minutesâ it did not
occupy more than fifteen. It was clear
and logical and carried with it the burden
of truth. There was no one to contradict
it, and what facts were obtainable helped
to bear it out.
In a few words it was the story of a
good girl deceived by a false suitor, of
betrayal, of a secret marriage, dishonor,
threatened desertion and death, conclud
ing with murder and attempted suicide.
And this was her story:
â¢'1 am Anna Mentel. 1 was married to
William Mentel in SUn Jose October 2 or
last year. After our marriage we came
back to San Francisco and I re
turned home the next day. I
nevejr lived in San Rafael nor
did Mentel ever live th*re. Under
promise of marriage I consented to live
with him as his wife, but he showed no
desire to carry out his promise. I was
eeriously sick at a hospital and he prom
ised me that when I recovered we should
be married. One night on Ellis street he
said he would throttle me. He struck me
and would have struck me again had not
a man pasod by. One evening we met on
Powoll street. I asked him to talk about
our affairs. He said that he did not want
to bother with me at all. I wanted to
know about our marriage. He said he had
to catch the boat to Alameda and told mo
to go there with him. He disappeared at
the ferry and the boat had almost reached
the mole when 1 found Mr. Mentel stand
ing on the front part of the boat. When
he saw me he made an attempt to run
away, but I caught him.
"When the boat stopped we got off and
took the train for Alameda. That was
the first time I was ever in Alameda in
my life. We got off at some street, but
I don't know where. I asked him what he
was going to do with me and asked for
our marriage license. He became angry
and used hard words, calling me vile
names and threatening that if I mention
ed marriage again he would brain me. I
demanded justice of him and he laughed
at my pleading, telling me that marriage
was a farre and that he did not believe
in It. I told him I would wait no longer;
that I wanted to know right then what
he was going to do. Thie made him furi
ous. He said if I referred to the matter
again he would kill me. I was afraid and
told him that I would go and tell his sis
ter and try to g.n justice at her hands.
Then he turned toward me and struck me
severely on the side of the head. The blow
stunned me anÂ«l I reeled and fell to the
sidewalk. T then took my revolver, and
when 1 was trying to get up from the
sidewalk 1 fired. I iired upward some
where."
At this point Attorney Foote stepped
up to the witness chair, took a fur cape
from the table and placed it around the
witness' shoulders, and said: "Now, now,
my child. tak<> your time. There is no
hurry. Don't cry. but tell the jury the
whole truth. The pistol was in this
pocket, was it not, and you took it out
and fired?"
"Did you know whom you were firing
at, or did you fire in thÂ» air?"
"I shot in the air somewhere, but I sup
posed he was there."
"Do you remember what you did after
ward? Did you shoot yourself ?"
"I think I did. 1 was so excited and
so nearly insane that 1 did not know
what I was doing. I do not know how
many times I shot. 1 know I was so mis
erable that I wanted to die right there.
It was my father's pistol." said the wit
ness, "and 1 took It a sHort time after
my marriage for self-protection, because
Mr. Mentel beat me and threatened to
kill me."
The prosecution had no desire to cross
examine the witness, and sobbing she
was led from the stand by Mr. Foote.
Adolph Beth, the defendant's father,
told briefly of his daughter's home life.
He said he never knew Mentel; thai
Anna was always quiet and always at
home, and he had implicit confidence In
her. Tie was not cross-examined, and the
case ended.
Counso] on both sides expressed a de
sire to have no argument, and neither
side wish.-d to submit any written in
structions to the court.
Judge Hal] read the statutory Instruc
tions to the jury at 11 o'clock. The jury
did not return at noon, and lunch was
ordered for it. A few minutes after court
met for the afternoon session the iurors
returned with the verdict exonerating the
defendant.
Mr. Foote shook hands with his young
client and congratulated her, a couple of
minutes was passed in hand-shaking
between the attorneys and the girl's rela
tives, and after Mr. Foote had expressed
his gratitude to the jury the incident waa
closed.

WHOLE FAMILY
WAS AFFLICTED
WITH INSANITY
Henry Collins Sent to
Stockton.
LAST MEMBER OF THE HOUSE
THEY LIVED IN SQUALOR AND
AMASSED A FORTUNE.
Mother Deeded Away Valuable Prop
erty for a Pittance, and Suits
Will Be Instituted to Re
cover It.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 6.
Henry Collins, aged 36 years, was com
mitted to the Stockton Insane Asylum
this afternoon by Superior Judge Greene.
His commitment closes a chapter in the
biography of a whole family of heredi
tary imbeciles. The Collins household
until a few years ago comprised Mrs.
Mary Collins, her feeble-minded husband,
two sons and two daughters, and the ag
gregation for many years was the terror
of the residents in the vicinity of Eighth
and Madison streets. Yet, withal, they
accumulated a fortune that reached close
to $20,000, consisting principally of choice
real estate on Eighth street, reaching
from Alice to Madison.
A few years ago the head of the house
died suddenly and in February, 1897, a
son, Willie, and a daughter died in the
Napa Insane Asylum. And only last year
Mrs. Collins followed them to the grave,
leaving as survivors the son, Henry, and
a daughter, Mary O'Kourke.
Just prior to her death Mrs. Collins
deeded away most of her property for a '
mere pittance. One piece, valued at the i
time at $6000, she gave away for $500. j
What remained was worth about $6W)O
and this Mrs. Collins bequeathed by will
to her only surviving daughter, Mary
O'Rourke, and only recently Mrs. Ellle
Whalen of Temescal was appointed guar
dian of the person and estate of the lat
ter.
Henry Collins was left absolutely noth
ing and yesterday the focal health author
ities found him In a little shack on the
old Collins property at 167 Eighth street
in squalor and filth.
W. B. White is the attorney for Mary I
O'Rourke's guardian, Mrs. Whalen, and
he announces that he will bring several
suits in the very near future to recover
some of the land Mrs. Collins deeded
away.
"Of course, when Mrs. Collins deeded
this property," said Attorney White to
day, "she was incompetent, and while it '
wifl require a great deal of work clearing '
i up titles, etc., I feel sure we can recover
sufficient so that the two surviving chil
dren, Mary and Henry, can be properly
provided for."
NO CHANGES TILL
FISCAL YEAR ENDS
SEDUCTION OF SALARIES IS NOT
OPTIONAL.
Candidates Are Already In the Field
for Every Probable Va
cancy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broad way, April 6.
It Is practically settled that whatever
changes are to be made in the depart
ments of the city government will not be
made until July 1. At that time there will
certainly be many surprises.
The recommendation to pass all the or
dinances which are necessary, in order to
give full forco to the Mayor's message,
shows very clearly what can be expected.
All the employes will have their salaries
reduced 25 per cent, but it will not be ac
cepted as a voluntary gift from the in
dividuals. The reduction will be made in
the salary of each office, and the office
holder will have no option but to draw
his reduced salary. This plan clearly
shows that it is not alone the purpose to j
reduce the salaries, but to make what- :
ever changes are necessary In the de- !
partment.
Had each employe been permitted to
return voluntarily one-fourth of his sal
ary till the t-nd of this fiscal ' year, it
would have been a great exhibition of In.
gratitude on the part of the city to re
move them from office at that time. Hav
ing reduced the salaries, however, they
cannot be raised until the offices are va
cant, and when they are refilled -the ajc
will fall.
Outside of the Police and Fire depart
ments there are likely to be but few if
any changes. It is hardly likely that an
attempt will be made to change the Street
Department, it being an acknowledged
fact that it has given the greatest satis
faction of any department of the govern
ment. In the Police and Fire depart
ments there is much room for specula
tion, but apparently no one is to be dis
turbed for more than two months.
Candidates are already cropping up for
every position the holder of which is con
sidered to be in doubt, but no one is able
to derive any satisfaction from visiting
the City Hall. The manner in which the
City Council has started out to support
the lines drawn by Mr. Snow is proof of
harmony among the heads of the govern
ment, and therefore every change mado
will be the result of deliberation among
the officials as a whole, and not the work
of one or two Individuals working from
personal motives. This has along been
the idea of Mayor Snow.
FRUIT PROSPECTS
WERE NEVER BETTER
ALAMEDA COUNTY MAKES A
FINE REPORT.
Washington Township Has One of
the Largest Crops of Beets
and Cherries.
NILKS, April 6.â At no time during the
year has the crop outlook been as bright
In this portion of Alameda County as at
present. Washington Township Is divid
ed naturally into three districtsâ the fruit,
the vegetable and the sugar-beet districts.
The recent rains, were the salvation of
the entire district, the total for the year
amounting to 14.41 Inches. Irrigation had
already been begun on a large scale.
Thousands of acres were being saturated
when the rains stopped It. The grain and
vegetables received all of the water they
could well stand. The fruit lands needed
more. Already irrigation plants are In
operation again.
The present outlook for sugar-beets is
of the best. The acreage will be immense
and with a few late showers the yield
will exceed anything of former years.
The vegetables are in excellent condi
tion with carloads going forward dally.
This includes rhubarb, potatoes and peas,
peas.
The shipment of nursery stock has ex
ceeded the combined shipments of the
two preceding years.
Grain never looked better. The yield
cannot fail now. The ground has moisture
enough to ripen the immense stand every
whem visible. The acreage is not above
the average.
Apricots promise great things. Some
orchards are falling badly, while others
are overloaded. The prices offered now
are J75 per ton, with prospects of an ad
vance when the yield is certainly fixed.
Oranges are large, sweet and a good crop.
although nearly all gone now. Almonds
promise well if more rain falls. Figs will
be scarce, the first crop having all fallen
off, owing to the drought. Cherries are
looking well. The trees are heavily
loaded and with warm weather will be
ready for picking within six weeks.

TO VOTE ON THE
PARK EXTENSION
Question Will Be Submitted at a
Special Election in May.
fhree and a Half Million Dollars to Be
Provided for Acquisition of the
Necessary Land.
ma
f\H Tuesday, the 23d day of May, the people of this city will Q
%J be called upon to express by vote their wishes regarding Â£>
the proposed extension of Golden Gate Park panhandle to Van &
Ness avenue. The matter will be submitted on the question of $
the issuance of bonds to the amount of $3,500,000. These
bonds will run for twenty years. To meet their payment will re- Â£
quire the setting aside each year of $175,000 as a sinkiag fund %%
with $112,500 a year additional for interest. These figures Â£â¢
have an impressive sound, but when dissected they are not for- Â£*
midable. If you are a taxpayer here is your share of this O
"white man's burden" which you will be called upon to bear. Â£,
If taxed on $100 worth of real estate or personal property 8 â¢',
cents will be added to your bill. If taxed for $1000 the in- Â£
crease will be 80 cents; on $10,000 it will be $8; on $100,000 O
it will be $80. If you are within the charmed circles of the %
millionaires you must pay $800 additional on each million. Â§
to
â  Tho Street Committee of the Supervis- j
ors took definite steps yesterday to place
in the hands of the taxpayers the widely
discussed question as to the expediency
of extending the panhandle of Golden
Gate Park into the very heart of the city.
Mayor Phelan, who has taken a lively
interest in the projected improvement,
conferred with the committee. He pre
eented estimates made by R. D. McElroy,
an expert In real estate, and by William
Curlett, an architect. According to their
Investigations, the land required is worth
f1.529.T67, and the improvements $1,364,755.
For he proposed connecting link between
the park and the Presidio the land is
appraised at $240,000 and improvements
$12,000.
The proposed acquisition of this property
has had the effect, according to his
Honor, of putting a stop to all dealing in
this land and placing it under a cloud.
Its owners are anxious to have the matter
settled once and for all, and this can only
be done by vote of the people. The elec
tion machinery would be placed in mo
tion at once and would be ready on any
â¢ day selected by the Supervisors. The
election will cost $11,000. A two- third
vote in favor of the measure is necessary
for its passage. The resolution which
will be presented to the Board of Super
visors on Monday is as follows:
Whereas, The City and County Attorney
' has rejiorted to the board that an election
lor sewer and scln>ol bonds cannot be held
on the aajne day as an â  lection for Pan
handle extension bonds, and -whereas, an
indebtedness lor tie construction of sewers
and school buildings may bo incurred only
under the municipal Improvement act,
which is . ..ate and distinct from the
park act, under which lands may be ac
â¢ quired lor park or boulevard purposes,
and the board will hereafter determine what
other improvements may be made at this
time, so tiat an election tuereiur may be
called to provide the means required as
soon as the Merchants' Association recom
mends the same and the expense is ascer
tained. The board, however, has decided as
to the desirability of acquiring lands for
the extension of the Panhandle and the con
nection of the I'ark with the Presidio, and
there is nothing inconsistent with other im
provements contemplated in acquiring; this
land now while values are low and private
improvements are tew; therefore,
ltesolved. That a special election be held
on Tuesday May 23, 1&Â»3, at which the peo
ple will be called upon to vote for or
against thÂ« acquisition of lands necessary
to extend the Park Panhandle to Van Ness
' avenue, and to connect the Park with the
' Presidio at a cost not exceeding $3,500,000,
â to be raised by the issuance of bonds to run
twenty years, bearing 3% per cent Inter
est, the board being of the opinion that San
Francisco should be adorned and beautified
and that this improvement will greatly odd
to the city 1 b attractions and thus draw
and hold a desirable population which will
add to the city's wealth; also by connect
ing the Park with the Presidio by the ac
quisition of land between Thirteenth and
Fourteenth avenue* the city practically an
nexes 1500 acres which are contained in the
Presidio reservation to its park system. we
. â  are further impelled to immediate action be
cause the people owning property are en
titled to an early decision as to whether or
not their land is to be acquired by the city
for these great public purposes.
The opinion of City Attorney Lane that
two matters could not be submitted at
one election has' given the proponents of
the measure some concern. They fear the
people of the outlying districts may make
a concerted effort to defeat it on the
ground that its adoption will delay the
improvements for which they are clam
oring. These will, in reality, come under
the direction of the Board of Public
Works and will not be affected by the ap
pro v;. of the park extension. This is ex
plained in the resolution drafted for pre
sentation Monday. .*.Â«_.Â«
The Street Committee showed the incli
nation of the Supervisors to break down
existing monopolies on public utilities. A.
y Martel. a dealer in a small way in light
and power, was granted permission to lay
a two and one-half inch steam pipe and
also conductors for the transmission of
electric power. The territory covered by
his concession la bounded by Third. Mar
ket East and Bush streets. Mr. Martel

to the city. ,

Draymen's Union and of a patent block
pavement company appeared before the
committee. They asked that the blocks
be accepted by the city as a special pave
ment. It is not incjuded in specifications
now The matter was taken under ad
visement. The committee reported in
favor of tho following matters:

VERDICT OF DEATH
GIVEN FOR SEA LIONS
THE REDUCTION OF THE VAST
HERDS IS ADVOCATED.
Many Interested Parties Are Wiling
to Assist the Fish Commis
sioners in the Project.
The resolution of the State Fish and
Game Commissioners to make a big re-
duction of the numbers of sea lions that
are destroying thousands of tons of fish
along- the coast every month, as pub
lished yesterday in The Call, has caused
much comment by men in many walks
of life in this city. As the move appeals
more particularly to those interested in
the fishing industry it is natural to sup
pose that this class is its stanchest sup
porter. At an early hour yesterday a
half dozen or more fish dealers and pro
prietors of .fishing institutions telephoned
to the commission and promised all the
support that the movement requires. Not
a few called and stated that they have
suffered for a long- time from the dep
redations of these rapacious animals,
which have destroyed m-ts to the value
of hundreds of dollars, to say nothing of
the fish they have killed.
Among the visitors was J. P. Haller of
Booth & Haller of the Sacramento River
Packers' Association. The gentleman
stated that for years past he has ob
served the destruction of salmon during
the spawning season at the principal
points up the river and bay by sea lions
and it is not exaggerating the case to say
that these animals kill every season In
the bay more fish than the canneries
pack, and the habit of the sea lion is to
kill SO per cent more than it fais. Tho
canners and fishermen have long wanted
to start a crusade against their common
enemy, but believed that to do so it would
be necessary' to have the backing of the
State officers. Mr. Haller said that his
firm wab willing and would be gl;id to
stand a part of the expense of the thin
ning out of the sea lion herds.
Another iiiteiested party was F. F..
Benjamin, who for years has had ample
opportunity to observe the destructive
propensities of the much-d'\<pi*"d creat
ures. He sent the following letter, ad
dressed to Secretary J. P. Habcock:
Dear Sir: Allow me to express my apprecia
tion of your efforts to' protect r.ur salmon flph
eriea by exterminating the herds of sea lions
alons the coast. 1 am a friend of the salmon
and from personal observations I know that
your statements as pet forth In this morning's
Call are correct In every particular. It is the
sincere hope of myself and numerous friends
that you make a firm stand against the rapa
cious seal, and that no sentimental arguments
in favor of the "majestic and picturesque sea
lion" be allowed to prevail against the fact
that those hordes of useless animals are de
pletlng nur home supply of the finest and most
valuable food and game fish in the world.
TOUTS truly, F. E. BEXJAMTN.
C. S. Benedict Informed Commissioner
Vogelsang thai, the move should bo cac
"Ut by all means. Mr. Benedict has
studied the pea lion from a utilitarian
standpoint and his testimony !s that the
creature is commercially worthless. Sev
eral years ago a man in the southern part
of the State attempted to establish an
industry on his own hook by trying out
sea lions' oil. He got the oil all right, but
after spending much time and money in
an attempt to deodorize it gave up the
project as a had job. No practical U3e
tuv, he made of the thick hide of the
beasts. The Commissioners do not expect
any opposition to the destruction of the
animals except from those who object to
killing from a sentimental standpoint.
The meeting at which the matter will be
discussed will be held within a week or
ten days.

RIGHTS OF CYCLERS
ARE AGAIN SUSTAINED
JUSTICE COOK DECIDES A SUIT
FOR DAMAdES.
California Associated Cycling Clubs
Win a Decisive Victory Over a
Reckless Teamster.
Justice G. W. F. Cook rendered a de
cision yesterday in the case of William
H. Carr, a bicyclist, against Henry Meyn
which is of unusual interest to wheelmen.
The bicycle is so much a vehicle of util
ity, owing to the repaying of Market
street, that this decision denning the
rights of riders will be welcomed by the
fraternity.
Mr. Carr was thrown from his wheel
after a collision with a wagon driven
by Henry Meyn. It appearing that Carr
was not at fault, the California Asso
ciated Cycling Clubs determined to insti
tute a suit. The law firm of Adams &
Adams appeared for the association. Af
ter a spirited presentation of the case it
was then takon under advisement by Jus
tice Cook. His opinion, in favor of the
wheelman, was rendered yesterday, as
follows:
The law applicable to the facts In this
cas* haa been Industriously presented by
the plaintiff: there can be no question as
to the rights of thp road on thn part or
the respective parties as matter of law;
that Is: the party traveling on a street or
road must as a rule of travel pass on the
right s!de of the center of the strpet or
road, in the direction in which he is travel
ing. Not that a traveler may not travel
on the left sMe of the road, but if he do. he
is railed upon t'-> exercise greater vigilance
as to travelers he may meet; that is. more
than ordinary care or vigilance. While the
traveler is on the right side of the road or
street he must use ordinary care and pru
dence or vigilance.
There is no question of law peculiar to the
rights of a bicycle traveler In a given road
or street. He has the same rights and is
subject to the same restrictions In traveling
the road or street as any other vehicle
traveler or any other traveler. The ques
tion here then is one of negligence on the
part of one or the other of the parties in
this case. This question Is one of both
law and fact.
C. P. HUNTINGTON \
"Reuben, Reuben, I've Been Thinking
What a Fine Thing It Would Be
If You'd Build a Whitewashed Fence
All Around This Earth for Me,' 3
I have come to the conclusion on the
evidence and law as stated In the foregoing,
that defendant, be.ing on the wrong side of
the street at the time of the accident, was
bound to be exercising, if not extraordinary
diligence and vigilance, certainly more than
ordinary diligence and vigilance in the con
duct of his vehicle. On the other hand, the
plaintiff had a right to expect a clear road
and was only amenable to the exercise of
ordinary diligence and vigilance when he
turned to the side, where he had a right
to turn, and where he was met by the de
fendant and his vehicle, and where he re
ceived the Injuries complained of.
I find that the defendant was not exercis
ing such diligence and care at the time of
the accident as his position on the wrong
side of the street and the law demanded,
and the plaintiff was at the time using the
care and diligence which the law required
of him and the collision was the defendant s
fault. Judgment, therefore, for plaintiff

HUNTINGTDN'S
ELECTION WAS
NOT UNANIMOUS
Stanford Votes Were
Against Him.
CAST FOR GENERAL HUBBARD
STILLMAN'S OUSTING POOD FOR
COMMENT.
Another Year May See Some Impor
tant Changes in the Official
Personnel of the South
ern Pacific.
C. P. Huntingdon remains president
of the Southern Pacific Company for an
other year at least, though his election
was not the result of a unanimous choice
of the directors. Mrs. Leland Stanford
can neither forgive nor forget Hunting
ton's abuse of her hushand, and her rep
resentatives will never be permitted to
cast a vote that, will do honor to her" hus
band's successor. The votes of Charles
G. Lathrop and R. J. Wilson were for
General Hubhard for president. All the
other directors voted for Huntington. No
changes were made in any of the offices,
which are as follows: President, C. P.
Huntington; vice president, Thomas Tf.
Hubbard; second vice president, Geeorge
Crocker; third vice president, J. C.
Stubbs; fourth vice president and gen
eral manager, J. Kruttschnitt; controller,
William Mahl; secretary and assistant
controller, E. C. Wright; treasurer, N. T.
Smith.
The story published in The Call of how
Stillman was driven from the directorate
of the Southern .Pacific Company, be
cause he would not cringe and bend the
knee to the railroad Caesar, was freely
commented upon yesterday in the rail
road building, and was admitted to be the
true history of events in that connection.
There are those who prophesy that an
other year may see a different result
when the election of officers is held. Had
not death taken Charles F. Crocker dur
ing the past year the predicted change
might have come yesterday.
Since Huntington has become the sole
survivor of the big four who built the
Central Pacific Railroad he has assumed
a manner in the conduct of its affuii;.
that has shown a lack of tact and an ut
ter absence of consideration for the feel
ings and opinions of his associates. He
has virtually arrogated to himself the
powers of a dictator, and those whom
he could not control he has sought to
destroy, much in the style prevailing
among the autocratic Presidents of the
Spanish-American republics.
It was a well-known fact that he and
the late Charles Crocker were not In ac
cord, and that the brothers of the lat
ter shared the dislike of their kinsman.
Evidently fearing the result of a possi
ble combination of the Stanford and
Crocker forces with Stillman, Hunting
ton made up his differences with the
Crockers during the meeting of the
Southern Pacific directorate recently in
the East and thus assured his continu
ance in power. Had General Hubbard
consented to become a candidate for the
presidency two years ago, it is believed
that he would have been elected by the
votes of the Stanford, Crocker and
Searles representatives.
Edward F. Searles. who was elected a
director Wednesday for the first, time
since he became possessed of his large,
block of Southern Pacific Company stock,
is a new factor in the situation. Should
Huntington be impolitic enough to antag
onize him, as he has most of his other
associates, there will probably be some
thing doing at the next annual election
of the Southern Pacific Company.

GAS AND ELECTRIC IS
STEADY AND HIGHER
MARKET QUOTATIONS AD
VAUCE A FULL POINT.
Report That Supervisors Will Re
scind Their Action Restores
Confidence and Arrests
Downward Tendency.
San Francisco Gas and Electric has
practically recovered from the effect of
the action of the Supervisors in fixing the
rate to consumers at $1 10 a thousand, and
this recovery is directly attributed to the
confidence which the holders of stock
place in the report published yesterday
morning to the effect that the Supervisors
would rescind lhr-ir action at the next
meeting of the board and fix the rate at
{] 50. STesterday tne stock moved up a
point, being quoted on t lie Stock and Bond
Exchange at 7;>!'2 to 73%. No sales of suf
ficient size or quantity to unfavorably
affect the market were made. It is he
lieved that these figures will not be ma
terially changed unless new causes for
apprehension should materialize or the
prediction as to the purpose of the Super
visors in the matter should fail of realiza
i tion. The big drop in the value of the
stock following the announcement of the
incorporation of the new Independent
Company is not likely to be followed by
further movement downward, from that
cause at least, as the. bulk of the stock
'is held by a clirjue of capitalists interested
in preventing a further decline, and any
off rrings by the smaller stockholders hav
ing ;i tendency to bear the market will
undoubtedly be taken care of. This fact
was evident yesterday, when the market
remained tirni and even advanced a trifle,
notwithstanding the efforts of the bear
element to force the price down.
There is very little likelihood that the re
ported intention of the Supervisors to
compromise with the gas company will
prove false, for while the members of the
board generally decline to commit them
selves on the subject, there is a marked
tendency on the part of several of the
Supervisors who voted for the resolution
last Monday to reconsider their action.
They intimate that they made a mistake
which they desire to correct.
In response to queries on the subject
yesterday the Supervisors expressed
themselves as follows:
Aigeltingerâ l believe In a fair rate.
Kalbenâ l am a $175 man, but would
compromise on $1 50.
Collinsâ That's my business. You will
Know where I stand when you hear my
vote next Monday.
Lackmannâ lf the rate is raised I would
stand for $135. We can't tell what may
happen.
Deasyâ l don't think we can reconsider.
The action of the hoard was undignified.
One would think it was child's play In
stead of millions being involved. Had
a rate of $1 35 been made it would un
doubtedly stand. A $1 10 rate is not sen
sible.
Phelpsâ l have given the matter no
thought.
Attr'dgeâ lf asl 50 rate is proposed as a
compromise I will vote for It. I want to
do what is right by all.
Hollandâ A $1 10 rate is too low. We
must do right by all.
Byingtonâ l am opposed to a $1 50 rate.
I believe the rate should be cut 30 per
cent.
In the meantime all talk of in
junctions and taking the matter
into court must be regarded as
speculation pure and simple. Should the
Supervisors conclude to leave the rate at
$1 10 some such action would undoubtedly
he taken by the gas company, but for the
present the directors of the corporation
have simply referred the question to their
attorneys, Bishop & Wheeler, for investi
gation. The work of the attorneys will
hardly be ready for several days at least,
and in the meantime the gas directors
say there is no occasion for haste. If the
action of the Supervisors is illegal it will
still be illegal a week hence, and there
is plenty of time in which to institute
legal proceedings to prove that fact and
protect the interests of the company.

Laden with the sirk and sorf> wounded
of those who have gone to Manila to vin
dicate and deff-nd this country's embryonic
policy of imperialism, the transport Ari
zona came into port yesterday with 143 of
ficers and men invalided home for "medi
cal attendance" at the post hospital at
the Presidio.
The Arizona's crew of invalids did not
present so sorry a spectacle as some of
those who have come before. These were
the wounded, thf> men who have gone
shouting into battle and paid for their en
thusiasm in blood and pain and
shattered bones. They were _ not
taken down with fevers generated
in deadly swamps nor with t"he
sicknesses that come of days of In
action in a tropical camp. It was a
bandage here or a stretcher there, or a
splint or a poultice that answered the roll
call when the Arizona's cargo was tn'ilfd
off the deck yesterday and ticketed on the
cars for "home."
Not one of them but offered up thanks
giving. For the better part of the year
they have waited, baked, fought, and suf
fered under the vertical rays of a south
ern sun. Not one of those who came in
yesterday but has spent such time in a
Manila hospital that he recognized the
h faith-giving zephyrs of the temperate
zone the moment the big boat sailed into
it. The testimony of every one of them
is a tale of horror and living death in a
country where none may live save those
who are born to it.
On board the- boat there were many
-whom the surgeons said when steam was
made in Manila would never live to see
this western port. There were fractured
skulls and mangled limbs, body wounds
that refused to heal under the hot suns
of the south and mangled limbs that
looked as though there were no cure in
them. They were all convalescent to a
certain extent, or they never would have
been started home. It is not the sick unto
denth that Uncle Sam sends back. But the
winds and softening sun of the north did
its work, and yesterday when the Arizona
docked there were but three of those who
started in their bunks who were not on
deck to cheer the Golden Gate when it
hove in sight.
Nearly a year of dread experience has
taught the army what a hospital ship
should be, and the Arizona, when she
started and when she brought up here
was all that good Government money
could make her. She was fitted with the
best and every man of the bullet-stric.kon
crew aboard her was loud in his praises
of the corps of surgeons sent out to wait
on their injuries.
Besides the 140 and odd men of the
ranks who fell at the first day's fighting
were Major "Williams of the First Nebras
ka, Captain C. L. Plckens of the First
Oregon and Lieutenant Irwin of the
"Washington Volunteers. Lieutenant
Charles Hogan of the First California
was also among them.
Lieutenant Hogan, who is well and
popularly known in this city, was shot
through the left breast in the first day s
fighting. As he was crossing an open rice
field with his company, Company M, he
was struck by a deadly Mauser that en
tered just above his heart, penetrated his
lung and emerged at his back, leaving a
ghastly wound that the surgeons said
would cause his death within a few hours
But Lieutenant Hogan had not had all
of his vitality baked out of him, and after
thirty days in the hospital was well
enough along to warrant his removal to
this country. He arrived here yesterday
almost well after five weeks of cool ana
invigorating winds and was willing last

evening by one of Detective Curtln's men
night to talk of his experiences on the
other side.
"1 did not know just what to make of
that first day," he said. "The First was
in quarters when the firing began and
was ordered to assemble, when it heard
heavy work going on on the other side
of the Pasig. General Mac Arthur's bri
