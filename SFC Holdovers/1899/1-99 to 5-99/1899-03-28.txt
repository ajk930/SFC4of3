MRS. STANFORD
SELLS CENTRAL
PACIFIC STOCK
Nearly Two Million Dollars
More for the Univer
sity.
The fart that Mrs. Jane Stanford disposed of her entire hold-
Ings In the Central Pacific Railroadâ 33,3oo sharesâ during her recent
visit to New York was made rmbiic for the first time yesterday. This
means that Mrs. Stanford will be able to fully carry out her late hus
band's plans concerning the great university at Palo Alto and that all
financial danger menacing the institution bearing the name, and erected
in memory of the son of the late Leland Stanford is past.
Mrs. Stanford'? Central Pacific stock was sold, it is said, at $52 a
share, making a total of $1,731,600. The profit thus realised by the Stan
ford estate amounts to a million dollars in a little more than four
months. In the winter of 1898 Central Pacific stock was quoted at $20
a share.
The deal by which Mrs. Stanford realizes her enormous profit will, it
is said, have no bearing on the reorganization of the road, nor will it affect
Mrs Stanford's standing in the affairs of the Southern Pacific. It was
known in January that. Mrs. Stanford contemplated the sale of her
Central Pacific stock, and her reason for wishing to sell was equally
known. Since 1593 she has more than once been on the point of dispos
ing of her jewels to keep the doors of the Palo Alto University open.
Probate litigation over the estate of her late husband had tied up
the money of the property to such an extent that the closing of the
university was more than once threatened. But these legal tangles
ill been settled in January, when rumors of Mrs. Stanford's pro
sale of Central Pacific stock were spread. The report was vigorously
denied at that time by Charles G. Lathrop, Mrs. Stanford's brother,
and manager of Stanford's estate in this city. The report, however, was
admitted to be true to-day, though no reason was given for the sale.

into custody in order that the public
might be deceived into thinking the city
administration was really trying to ap
prehend the murderers. :
"Following are the facts in the case,
and Mayor Harrison, 'dinkey Dink
Kenna, the police and others knew them
fully as well yesterday as did eyewit
nesses to the affray:
"James Kinahan was one of the gang
of confidence men who operated under the
protection of the Harrison-Hinkey-Dink
combination, He lived in a Democratic
colony house, 157 Plymouth place, and was
not a legal voter. He, registered under an
assumed name, and was put on the 'sus
pect' lists by the Republicans, He re
ceived a notice informing him ho must
qualify last Saturday night or have his
name erased from the polling lists. He
feared to commit perjury and did not an

"Late Saturday night he met various
members of the Andy Craig confidence
gang and visited numerous levee dives
with them. While in the Maine saloon, a
thieves' resort at 408 State Btreet, Kina
han borrowed a revolver. He then went
to Alderman 'Hinkey Dink' Kenna's
'store' saloon, at 50 Hubbard court. There
he met fifty confidence men and thieves,
all of them known as Harrison's stanch
supporters, because of the protection
granted them by the city's chief magis
trate.
"One of the men In the saloon had lust

Kinanna's resort about 4 o'clock Sunday
morning. As he stepped inside the man
who had been at the registration booth
stepped forward and asked: "Why in hell
didn't you answer the suspect notice,
Jim?' ''Game is too strong for me,' Kina
han replied. 'Republicans are next, and
me if I want to stand for them.'
â¢' 'This is the fellow who is squealing to
the Inter Ocean,' Klnahan's intruder ex
claimed. 'He's the we're
after.'
"With an oath the thus drew his revol

severely. Another thug also drew a re
volver and rushed at the confidence op
erator. Kinahan turned and ran from the
saloon with the two men in pursuit.
When near the corner of Wabash avenue
and liubbard court he turned on the pur
suers <Â«nd emptied his revolver at them.
His shuts went wide, and he turned to
run. but before he had taken two steps
a bullet from the revolver in the hands of

back. Another bullet struck him as he
crossed Wabasb avenue. Wounded unto
death, the fugitive ran into the saloon
at 4iHÂ» Wabash avenue, up a flight of
stairs and into a wineroom, where lie fell
dead.
"The names of the murderers are known
to certain polire officials at. the Harrison
street station, and there would be no dif
ficulty in fastening 1 the crime on the
guilt y persons wore it not for orders from
the Mayor's agents to hush up the affair
until after the campaign. Deputy Cor
oner Weckler, however, is determined to
bring: the murderers to justice, and de
spite the efforts to block the way in the
case, he expects to land thorn behind the
bars of the County Jail before a week
has passed. He declares the most des
perate efforts on the part of the Mayor
and his agents to quiet the case or to
postpone the Inquest until after the elec
tion will not stop him."
A warrant was issued to-night for the
arrest of Alderman John J. Coughlln,
alias Rath House, charging him with as
sault with intention to kill Richard
Hardiman. Hardiman is in a serious con
dition at the County Hospital. The war
rant Is in the hands of Constable Michael
Jonas. Alderman Coughlln is under cover,
and at a late hour to-night had not been
found.
Mayor Harrison's colonization thugs,
led by "Bathhouse." took possession of
thf City Hall to-day. They then pro
ceeded to assault Election Board wit
nesses summoned to give evidence
against the thieves, tramps and vaga
bonds colonized by the Mayor's panel
house Democracy. The- police, acting tin
der instructions from the Mayor's Chief
of Police, declined to preserve order. So
violent became the riot that the Election
Commissioners became convinced that
their lives were in danger and fled to the
county building and the protection of
Sheriff Magerstadt. One witness. Rich
ard Hardiman. a negro, was so severely
beaten that he. may die. The victim says
Coughlln himself inflicted the injuries.
Witnesses corroborate him.
"Bathhouse" Coughlin led the attack on
Republican witnesses in person. He was
standing in the doorway of the Election

JAMAICA IS
ON THE VERGE
OF ANARCHY
Great Britain Forcing the
Islanders to Open
Revolution.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
IfT.-Jd. Copyrighted.. 1535, by James Gor
don Bennett. _
PORT ANTONIO, Jamaica, March
27. â This island of Jamaica, British
West Indies, is passing through a se
vere crisis. The Governor is afraid to
occupy his residence and if anarchism
does not break out it will be entirely
due to the unequaled loyalty of the
! people.
Though the island is taxed to its ut-
most capacity, with a tariff of 60 per
cent on necessaries, a weak govern
ment, in order to provide funds to pre
vent a reduction of its members' sal
aries, has actually introduced a higher
tariff.
The salaries of the Jamaica officers
amount to nearly 50 per cent of the
revenue collectible. The people, while
willing to support these officials, have
not the meaifs to do it.
The home government will not per
mit countervailing duties and thus the
sugar industry is crippled. Coffee can
find no market owing to the enormous
output of the world, and banana grow
ing is the only industry to which the
people can look as a means of support.
Dependence upon even this .article will
soon be impossible. The Boston Fruit
Company, which controls the industry
in Jamaica, is confronted by keen com
petition in (Vntral America and Cuba
and has been compelled to reduce the
purchasing price of bananas to 90 cents
a bunch, with a possibility of a further
reduction if Cuban bananas should be
admitted to the United States free of
duty. Under these circumstances the
cultivation of fruit by small settlers
would be impossible and the peace of
the island would be seriously threat
ened. Jamaica then will be driven by
the British Government to anarchism
or perhaps worseâ rebellion.
The island parliament is in session
and the people's representatives are
fighting hard to throw out the tariff
bill as a measure of relief. As the
Government side is further strength
ened by an additional four members to
outvote the people it will succeed. The
whole country is aroused and indig
nant. The Governor is afraid to re
main at his residence. He is always
traveling away from it, and to-day he
is under the protection of the American
flag, being a guest of the president of
the Boston Fruit Company at this
place.
lin and thP gang during the morning, and
several were Beverely injured. The cries
of the d< CenaelesÃ men resounded through
the corridors of the City Hall, and the
Election Commissioners sent Deputy
Sheriffs to arrest the thugs. As soon as
the deputies appeared they were assault
ed or arrested by constables on warrants
issued by a County Justice and charging
disorderly conduct. As the noon hour ap
proached the Commissioners became con
vinced that their own lives were in dan
ger and they sent for Sheriff Magerstadt
and asked his protection.
A conference was held, and as the po
lice refused to interfere with the thugs
the Sheriff advised the election officials
to move the office into the county build
ing. This advice was accepted, and sur
roundeti by deputies the Commissioners
and clerks left the City Hail and passed
through the corridors to a. room In the
c*unty building. Sheriff Magerstadt, act
ing as custodian of this structure, placed
men on guard at the entrances to the
building and prevented further riots.
To-night the situation was alarming,
and it is feared that murder will be com
mitted before the Commissioners finish
the reviews of election frauds.
Mayor Harrison and his agents are wild
with rage over the practical defeat of
their colonization plans, and the thugs
and thieves under the banner of a panel
house Democracy stand ready to kill as
soon as the Mayor's agents give the word.
AGUINALDO'S MAIN
ARMY IS DEFEATED
BEFORE MARILAO
Americans Drive the Rebels Toward
Malolos, but the Loss on Both
Sides Is Heavy.
MANiLA, March 28, Noon.â The main insurgent army of 5000
men, under the personal command of Aguinaldo, the rebel leader,
has been routed after three hours' hard fighting by General Mac-
Arthur's division. The fight occurred at Marilao, which the Filipinos
burned before deserting the town.
MANILA, March 28. â The armed gunboat Laguna de Bai attacked the insurgents
at Bulacan to-day. Three Americans were wounded.
Mac Arthur's division has crossed the Marilao River on a pontoon bridge and
is now advancing northward toward Malolos.
This afternoon Garcia, a native general, came down from Dagiipan by train with 1000
riflemen and 4000 bolomen and took position at Marilao. A river was between the Ameri
can and the insurgent forces. The South Dakota volunteers and the Third Artillery were
thrown forward, and the South Dakota men charged brilliantly across an open space on the
east of the railway to the edge of some woods. They lost ten killed and eleven wounded, in
cluding three lieutenants.
The Third Artillery, on the right of the railroad, charged and lost nine men wound
ed, two mortally.
Marilao was taken with sixteen prisoners.
On the left the insurgents in a trench east of the river offered stubborn resistance.
Lieutenant Critchlow, with ten guns of the Utah Battery, and Lieutenant Davis, with a
navy Colt gun, forced thirty insurgents in a long trench on the opposite side of the river to
surrender at the close quarters of 100 yards. The rest of the insurgents got out with severe
loss. Yesterday we counted go insurgents dead.
The insurgents attacked the Americans last evening at Marilao, but were repulsed
with severe loss. Our loss was five killed and fourteen wounded.
MANTT-A. March 28.â The Ameri
can advanco began early in the
morning from Meyoauyan.
â¢where our forces 1 had encamped
the night before. Brieadier
Genera) Hale's brigade advanced alone
the right of the railroad and the bri
gade under command of Brigadier Gen
eral Harrison Gray Otis on the loft.
General Wheaton's brigade was held in
resorvp at Meyoauyan.
The American troops had not ad
vanced far when the enemy opened a
heavy fire from the- left on the Third
Artillery, which was mis' advanco
guard. The artillery responded heart
ily to the insurgent attack and drove
the enemy helter skelter across the
river Marilao. ' Here the Filipinos made
a desperate stand. They retired within
their trenches which were only fifty
yards in front of the advancing Ameri
cans. The halt proved fatal to the Fili
pinos, for under repeated volleys from
two guns of the Utah Battery under
Lieutenant Crlchton and an automatic
Colt's under Ensign Davis they were
completely routed, leaving many dead
and wounded on the field.
In the meantime the men of the First
South Dakota had performed one of
the most, no-table feats of the campaign.
Cheering loudly, they charged fearless
ly across the open field against the
main line of the insurgent forces, which
was lying partly concealed in a bamboo
thicket.
It was a daring act, for across the
level plain the insurgents poured a per
f. ct rain of bullets. Ten gallant West
erners were killed and eleven wound
ed. Among tho dead were three lieu
tenants. Bui <>ur men pressed on re
gardless of the rain of death and scat
tered the enemy.
Fearful loss was inflicted on the reb
els in this charge. Eighty-eight are
known to have been killed and 100.
with arms, were captured. The re
mainder fled toward Malolos in wild
disorder.
The pursuit will be maintained dur
ing the day, and it is hoped Mao Arthur
will bivouac in sight of the insurgent
capital to-night.
The American loss in yesterday's
fight is said to have been fifteen killed
and thirty-five wounded.
Owing to the danger of making mis
takes in names. Otis refuses to allow
the correspondents to transmit a list
of casualties.
Tf the statement of the thirty-five
prisoners captured to-day is true, the
main body of the enemy has retreated
to Malolos. There are no more trenches
to encounter, although over thirty vil
lages including the larger settlements
of Bulacan and Guguinta. intervene.
At every railroad station circulars
have been posted signed by the Filipino
commander-in-chief. Antonio Luna,
ordering all spies and bearers of news
to the enemy to be shot without trial
and instructing that all 'looters and
ravishers be treated in the same man
ner. Further, all towns abandoned by
the Filipino troops are first to be
burned.
While deploring the existence of war,
the circular maintains the undeniable
right of the Filipinos to defend their
homes, lives and lands against "would
be dominators who would kill them,
their wives and children," adding that
this motive ought to impel all Filipinos
to sacrifice everything.
The Washington Regiment had an
exciting experience yesterday and dis
played much gallantry. The soldiers
found a band of insurgents concealed
in a stone house over which the French
flag was flying. A private volunteered
to set ftre to the building. He did so
and the troops approached while it was
burning and the Filipinos had appar
ently fled. But they were greeted â with
a sudden volley from the balcony of the
hn llK e. resulting in th" building being
cleared of the enemy in short order.
The T'nitAd States Philippine Com
mission proposes to issue a proclama
tion immediately after the rebel gov
ernment at Maloios is dispersed, be
lieving that the most effective moment
to secure the allegiance of the natives
will be after they have received an ob
ject lesson of the Americans' power.
The shelling of Paranaque to-day
was not premeditated. The Mo
nadnnck anchored off the town, and the
insurgents, emboldened by the long
silence of the warships on guard duty,
opened fire on her with muskets, with
the result that one man was killed and
three were wounded. The Monadnock
then destroyed half the town, including
the church.
AGONCILLO WILL NOW
PROCEED TO MADRID
LONDON. March 27.â Losinado. the
Filipino delegate, has gone to Paris to
meet Agoncilio, Aguinaldo's agent,
who is expected in London shortly. The
Filipino who was chief of the European
junta during Agoncillo's absence in
America, suddenly started on Satur
day for Spain by way of Paris. Un
otln-ial Filipinos here assert that he is
going to Seville on private business and
that he will return on April 16. They
admit, however, that he will confer at
Paris with Agoncilio, who is said to
have been in telegraphic communica
tion with Aguinaldo in order to get
the latter to appoint a delegate to go
td Madrid on a mission connected with
the Spanish prisoners in the hands of
th^ Filipinos. It is therefore thought
probable that. Agoncilio has instructed
th" delegates to proceed to Madrid.
The Filipinos here assert that peace
was in sight hefore the recent fighting,
but that now Major General Otis will
not treat for peace until Malolos, the
Filipino headquarters, is taken.
No Filipino accounts of the recent
fighting have hoen received, and they
are not expected for some days to come.

STRONGLY PROTEST
AGAINST ALLIANCE
German-Americans Go
on Record.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 27.â The Auditor!- |
urn was packed full this evening of !
German-Americans, called together to
protest against an Anglo-American al- |
liance, and the alleged false assertions |
made against Germany in connection
with the recent Spanish-American war. ;
The committee in charge received ap- j
plications for several thousand more j
tickets of admission than there were j
seats in the hall. A chorus of 700 male j
voices was one of the features of the
programme.
Ex-Congressman William Voceck pre- |
sided and delivered the opening ad
dress. Other speeches were made by
William Rapp on "The Immigrated
Germans," Fritz Glouger on "The
American People Not Anglo-Saxon," j
the Rev. Rudolph A. John on "The
American-Born Germans," and the |
Rev. George D. Heldmann on "What ;
We Demand." The meeting was a very |
enthusiastic one and the following de- j
claration was unanimously adopted:
With profoundest indignation we have 4
noticed the persistent efforts of English I
and American newspapers not only .to in
cite in our people vicious prejudices j
against Germany and to defame the char
acter of the German-American, but als>o
to drag the United States into an alliance |
W As FovlTcftizens of this republic it is
our right as. well as our duty to resist
these wicked practices with all due hrm
ness. The emigrants from Germany have
brought with them to this land the
achievements of civilization as high as it
"old Upon every field of the intellectual
of our nation, as well as in commerce,
industry and agriculture, their efforts
have redounded to the weal of our people, ;
and In peace as well as in war they have
at all times faithfully fulfilled their duty. |
No Dart of the American people has done
more for the cultivation of music Bocia
bilitv the arts, science, the churches and
schools than the Germans. As good citi
zens of this country we cheerfully hand
over the achievements of German culture j
to our youthful American' people, still in
a state "of development.
We emphatically object, therefore to |
the attempt to stamp our people as An- ,
glo-Saxons and to make it subservient to â 
English guile. Not England hut tne
whole of Europe is the mother country of j
the white inhabitants of the Lnited
St3,tC J 8
" We demand that not only friendly re
lations be maintained with Germany, that
has been a faithful friend of our people |
for more than 120 years, but that peace â 
and harmony be cultivated with all na
tions, and we will, therefore, true to the
wise counsel of George Washington, at |
all times oppose the formation of all en. |
tangling alliances with England, as well
as with other countries, whereby our
country may be involved in unnecessary
We denounce the dffamera who have
not only instigated pifclic ill-will against

slanderers also when the seeds of discord
were sown among our people, and we sol

We further declare that with all law
ful means at our disposal, especially in |

strenuously oppose all those who favor
the wicked attacks made upon friendly

country in an alliance with England. "W e
call upon the committee thai has charge

â  SYDNEY, N. S. W., March 27. â The, announcement of the discovery 13
jCjj of a sea monster at the island of Suwarrow has excited great interest, p.
& both in scientific circles and among the general public. Only a small S3
2? portion of the skeleton was brought here by the steamship Emu, but it g*.
8 is intended during the next trip of the vessel to call again at Suwarrow a

j. two skulls, with one lower jawbone, a rib, and one of the bones of the Â§5
$ vertebrae. The skulls measure about three feet one of the bones to the- #
vertebrae. The skulls measure about three feet from the neck to the &
S point of the nose, and have a partial resemblance to the skull of an g
cÂ» alligator. The teeth are missing, but there are evidences of the exls- jj
8 tence of two small tusks at the extremity of the lower jaw. There are 0
*3 channels in the skull which seem to have been for the purposes of SS
S breathing. The rib is about 2% feet in length, and the spine is appar- , V

CONFERENCE OF QUAY'S
SUPPORTERS CALLED
Senator Magee and His Followers
May Soon Desert to the
Opposition.
HARRISBURG. Pa.. March 27.â There
are rumors here to-night that a confer
ence of Senator Quay's friends through
out the State will he held at the Execu
tive Mansion on Wednesday to discuss
the Senatorial contest. The story is that
Mr. Quay has notified his friends that he
Is feeling too badly to leave Florida at
this time and that he will leave his can
didacy entirely in their hands. Senator
C. L. Magee or Allegheny and his follow
ers, who have been voting for Mr. Quay
since the beginning of the deadlock, are
expected to break away within ten days,
and this is assigned as the most potent
rgason for the conference. Senator Magee
is not in Harrisburg to-night and will
not reach here till to-morrow. Senator
Mitchell of Jefferson, who assumes to
speak for the Quay legislators, says Mr.
Quay will remain a candidate, no matter
what Senator Magee and his followers
may do. He is the only Quay leader on
the ground to-night.
The anti-Quay Republicans are expect
ed to concentrate on a candidate to-mor
row or Wednesday to show their full
strength. They have hitherto divided
their votes among a dozen different men.
Vhe air is full of all sorts of rumora
about the Senatorship, but none of them
can be traced io any reliable sources ex
cept that Mr. Quay will not come to
Harrisburg this week.

SERIOUS CRISIS IN
RUSSIAN CABINET
NEW YORK, March 27.â A special cable to the Journal from Berlin
says: According to reports received here from St. Petersburg there i 3
a crisis in the Russian Cabinet. The Czar has found out that his Min
isters have been systematically concealing important matters of state
from him, such as for one example, the extent of the famine in Russia.
It is also reported that Ministers acted without authority in taking
extreme measures against the Duchy of Finland. When the Czar be-
came aware of the independent moves of his Cabinet there was a stormy
scene, the Czar declaring to the Ministers that he was ruler, and would
not allow the Cabinet to supersede his authority in any particular.
The Czar was particularly severe on the Minister of the Interior, M.
Goremy Kine, who is likely to be superseded by M. de Witte, Minister
of Finance.
It is also expected that M. Bogolepow, Minister of Instruction, will
be dismissed on account of his conduct in recent student troubles.

Ik
Kingship Question in
Samoa Held Open.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. March 27.â The live
ly discussion of Samoan affairs in the
foreign press seems to be the sequel
of the developments of last week, which
have not been followed by, any material
change in the situation. Secretary Hay
has had further conferences with Em
bassador yon Holleben of Germany,
and Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British
Embassador, but these, it is stated quite
positively, have not advanced the sub
ject toward a settlement.
The Berlin report In one of the Lon
don papers to the effect that the Ger
mans had determined to abandon the
support of King Mataafa in order to
induce the United States to withdraw
Chief Justice Chambers is not borne
out by any proposition made* here. It
is the view of the State Department
that if the Germans withdrew support
from Mataafa the trouble would prac
tically be over, as the kingship is at the
bottom of the present nffair.
Thus far, however, there has been no
intimation that the Germans would
abandon Mataafa. On the contrary,
the understanding has been that the
contention between Mataafa and Ma
lietoa would go over to await fuller in
formation, the only action in the mean
time being restricted to the contro
versy between German, American and
PROGRESS OF
ADVANCE UPON
THE FILIPINOS
Satisfactory Reports Received at
Washington as to American
Operations.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, March 2?.
The third day of fighting north of
Manila brought little of a decisive char
acter from which War Department offi
cials could judge what the final out
come of this movement would be. In
all official quarters the most intense in
terest prevailed, but there was no excite
ment and none of that anxiety and ten
sion shown during the memorable days
of last summer, when the decisive
blows were being struck at Santiago.
Early in the day General Otis cabled
the War Department a brief but com
prehensive dispatch summing up the
situation. It disclosed that severe fight
ing was going on to-day with our forces
advanced as far north as Mariloa, while
the insurgents, under the command of
Aguinaldo, were being driven back with
considerable slaughter. This and the
press dispatches satisfied the officials
that the strategy movement of entrap
ping the insurgents between our lines
had not proved as successful as de
signed, and that the move had now
shifted to a retreat by Aguinaldo's
forces and a pursuit by our. troops. The
insurgent retreat toward Malolos was
slow and dogged and advantage was
taken of one after another of lines of
intrenchments, the burning of bridges
and the interrupting of communication.
General Otis 1 dispatch, although re
ceived early to-day, was sent Monday
evening. Manila time, and summed up
the work of the three days. The fight
ing would proceed into the fourth day
was shown by his closing sentence:
"The column will press on in the morn
ing." This refers to Tuesday.
The engagement has now shaped
itself so that it is looked upon as more
of a chase than the execution of a
strategic movement. With the Ameri
can base advanced to Mariloa and the
insurgent base forced back to Malolos
the main bodies of the two opposing
forces are about ten or twelve miles
apart. This could be quickly covered
in a forced march under fair conditions,
but it is twelve miles of innumerable
difficulties and obstacles, which our
troops must cover before they reach the
insurgents' stronghold.
It is" expected that the engineers with
Mac Arthur are hastily repairing the
burned bridges. This will permit the
artillery to be taken forward as well
as the infantry columns. It is expected
that every mile of the distance to Ma
lolos will be contested by the insur
gents, for General Otis reports that it
is a stretch of country covered with
the intrenchments thrown up during
the last three months. Our men, there
fore, must advance slowly, repairing
the roads as they go and at the same
time they must fight their way through
well-made rebel intrenchments. Seri
ous as the work is there is no lack of
confidence among officials here as t<
the satisfactory outcome of the cam
paign.
Malolos is the insurgent capital,
where the assembly has been sitting
and the insurgent government has been
in operation. It represents more to
the insurgents than any other place
in the Philippines and little doubt is
entertained that they will make a des
perate stand there. The tactics of
Aguinaldo are taking him gradually
beyond the range of Admiral Dewoy's
guns. While the insurgents were at
Malabon on Saturday, they were within
a mile of the water front and easily
within range of the fleet. But as they
have moved northward they have grad
ually gone from the bay. Malolos is
about seven miles back from the bay,
although there are shallow estuaries
which would permit light-draught
boats to get within a mile or two.
With to-day the fighting has lasted
seventy-two hours. Judged by the
standards of great battles, such as
Waterloo, Plevna and others men
tioned by army authorities, this is a
long and intensely arduous engage
ment. But the fighting at Manila is
quite different from the standards of
civilized armies, as it is' a running
brush conflict with only occasional is
sues between organized bodies of
troops. Some of the battles of the Civil
War lasted many days, notably the
battle of the Wilderness and the fight
ing about Richmond.
In speaking of the element of endur
ance. General Ste-nberg said to-day
that he had gone for seven days in the
continuous fighting around Richmond
without renewing the supplies origin
ally issued before the fighting began.
The main question in these long-con
British Consular and municipal offi
cers.
The following from an interview at
Apia with Chief Justice Chambers, pub
lished in the News of Auckland, would in
dicate that outside agencies were at work
in the precipitation of the war in Samoa:
"What was the cause of Mataafa be
ginning the war?" Mr. Chambers was
asked.
"Well," answered the Chief Justice, "I
should sny it was largely owing to the
action of officials in Samoa, who are
neither British nor American officials. I
believe if Mataafa had been left to him
self he would not have aspired to the
kingship but would have contented him
self as high chief of his own district
When my decision was given in favor of
Malietoa Tanu, 1 met the high chiets on
both sides, and I firmly believe those men
Intended to loyally abide by the decision."
"Is there any evidence of the interfer
ence Of Europeans in the kingship ques
"There is plenty evidence of a kind.
For instance, the native Chief Justice and
the native. Secretary of State in the Sa
moan Government called upon President
Raffei for their salaries for the month of
December last. President Raffei. who is
also Treasurer of the Government, told
them that before he could pay them he
must see the German Consul. They went
with him to see the Consul, and were in
formed that their salaries could not be
paid as there was to be a change of Gov
ernment in a few days."
"Did the Samoans receive the assistance
of any Europeans during the war?"
"There is little doubt on that subject,
and there is no doubt that they were per
suaded by Europeans to begin the war."
"\re the reports as to the action of the
German officials during the .lighting cor-
rect ?"
"There is a sworn affidavit from one of
the principal citizens of Apia bearing on
this subject; probably you know of it. It
is well known throughout Apia that Cap
tain Sturdee censured the Consul for the
part he was taking, and censured him
before a number of people."
The Chief Justice, when asked to ac
count for the apparent majority Jn favor
of Mataafa. said that such majority was
more apparent than real. Evidence taken
on this subject before the decision show
ed that the followers of Malletoa Tanu
â¢were as numerous as those of Mataafa,
and Malietoa. without a majority, was
legally entitled to the kingship.

MACARTHUR
GOES OVER
ANDERSON
WASHINGTON, March 27.â A
Washington special to the Her
ald says: As a result of his gal
lantry and judicious manage
ment of the campaign against
the insurgents, the War Depart
ment has practically determined
to appoint Arthur Mac Arthur,
now major general of volunteers
and a lieutenant colonel in the
regular army, to be brigadier
general in the regular service.
General Mac Arthur's appoint
ment will be made immediately
after the retirement of General
Sumner, who will be appointed
to the vacancy in the regular
establishment caused by the re
tirement to-day of Brigadier
General Marcus P. Miller, who
relinquishes his command of the
troops at lloilo.
It was intended that after
General Sumner's appointment
and retirement Major General
Anderson, now on duty with
General Otis, should be appoint
ed a brigadier general in the reg
ular establishment, but General
Mac Arthur's work in pursuing
Aguinaldo's forces has been of
such an excellent character that
the department feels that it will
only be a just reward to appoint
him to the grade.
tinued fights is to have all supplies,
stores, etc., kept abreast of the fighting
force, so that there may be no exhaust
ion. In this respect all the reports of
the fighting about Manila are most
gratifying to the authorities here, in
showing that the quartermaster, com
missary, medical and signal stores are
well up with our righting lines.
The belief is expressed at the War
Department that the Filininos are man
ufacturing the ammunition that is be
ing used with such recklessness. When
General Greene was in the Philippines
he went to the Filipino camps and re
mained some time. His report to the
President shows that the Filipinos ob
tained quite a large supply nf arms and
ammunition when Dewey captured Ca
vite, and that they had heretofore ob
tainqgl a supply of Remingtons and
Mausers.
General Greene also found that the
Filipinos had established a factory for
the manufacture of ammunition for
these rifles, and this factory probably
is still in operation and furnishing a
sufficient supply to the insurgents.
A short time ago the Zealandia and
Puebla left San Francisco with the
Ninth Infantry, bound to Manila. By
the Ist of April four transports are ex
pected to arrive at San Francisco from
Manila and they will return with rein
forcements for Otis about the 25th of
that month.
The Hancock will takÂ° the Twenty
first Infantry, the Warren eight batter
ies of the Sixth Artillery and recruits,
the Newport 250 marines --- " recruits
and the Morgan City six companies of
the Thirteenth Infantry. A little later
the Ohio will arrive and return with the
remainder of the Thirteenth Infantry.
The Senator is also expected later in
the month and can take 1000 men.
The use of Chinese as litter-bearers
is said to he a device to save our own
men for the more serious work. The
Chinese carry a light bamboo litter,
and, being accustomed to the cllmptÂ«
they can travel twice as far as an un
acclimated carrier. The main point,
however, is that the fighting force is
kept intact. While the casualty list is
a source of profound regret in army
quarters, it is said to be comparatively
low. considering the number of men en
gaged and the durition of the action.
This is accounted for by the long-range
shooting of the insurgents, who do not
shoot at a mark but in the general di
rection of our lines. While these stray
bullets do considerable havoc in our
lines, it is far less than the results of
close-range volleys from tit* I**1 ** ranks of
insurgents in the open or from a con
siderable number of sharpshooters.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 27.â Thft
prospect of an increase in passenger
rates to and from San Francisco
when the Santa Fe shall finally reach
there causes speculation in railroad
circles. It has been rumored that at
a meeting of passenger representatives
of the Southern Pacific and Santa Fe
companies it was practically decided to
raise the first-class San Francisco rate
to $15 each way, the figure quoted be
fore the Valley Road compelled a re
duction to the $13 rate now in exist
ence. X was given out positively at
the Santa Fe headquarters to-day that.
an increase was not contemplated. Th-
Santa Fe will be running trains into
San Francisco about December 15, al
though the time for the service may be
fixed at an earlier date. General Pas
senger Agent Byrne said:
"We intend to give the public a
service at least as good as that of the
opposition. It is not yet known how
many trains daily will be run on the
new line."
The Santa Fe Company wffl buy 2000
more freight cars. The recent rains in
sure a heavy graiy crop, the transpor
tation of which will overtax the pres
i ent equipment of the Valley division.
This rolling stock must be delivered in
time to be available for moving the
wheat crop of the San Joaquin Valley.
The Santa Fe is in such a position that
it can take at least one-half the wheat
â¢shipments from the valley this year.
George A. Nickerson of Boston, a
Santa Fe director and well known cap
italist, is in San Francisco. It is his
I intention to inspect the San Joaquin
line, accompanied by Second Vice Pres
ident A. H. Payson.
The company has plrnty of money for
all present needs. The Hellman syndi
cate, which two years ago bought the
$6,000,000 bond issue of the Valley road,
agreeing to pay monthly installments,
has up to the present paid $4,500,000.
The directors count upon the remaining
$1,500,000 to pay for the completion of
the road into San Francisco. It is
stated that the $450,000 recently paid for
freight terminal facilities at tho f>">t
of Bryant street, San Francisco, came
from the treasury of the Santa Fe.

%HELD TO ANSWER
FOR THE WANTON
KILLING OF A BOY
Bail Is Denied Former Deputy
Sheriff Desirello of San
Mateo County.
REDWOOD CITY, March 27.â "Held
to answer and committed to the cus
tody of the Sheriff without bail."
Such was the order of the commit
ting magistrate, James Harmon, this
in the case of former Deputy
Sheriff Frederick Ferdinand Wallace
Desirello, charged with the murder of
James Johnston. The first part of the
order was not unexpected, though from
the evidence introduced it was thought
that possibly the prisoner would be ad
mitted to bail. The courtroom was
thronged with the usual crowd that at
tends cases of this kind. The air be
came so close and stifling that it was
necessary to open the doors and win
dows.
Desirello was accompanied by his
wife. Peter Johnston, the father of
the dead boy, was the first witness
balled for the prosecution. A stir was
caused when the court made an order
directing the Sheriff to search the wit
ness, it having been brought to his at
tention that Johnston had threatened
to kill Desirello upon sight, whether it
be In court, or out. Upon being satisfied
that the father had upon his person no
deadly weapon, the court ordered the
examination to proceed.
Johnston testified that he was the
father of Desrrello's victim, who at the
time of his death was a#out IT years of
age. The boy was on a visit to a mar
ried sister in Culma at the time of the
kii". :
During the cross-examination it was
attempted to show that neither the
complaining witness, the deceased nor
any of their relatives knew or had ever
had trouble with Desirello. The object
was t" show want of malice on the
part of the prisoner. From the trend
â of the questions asked It is evident that
t h e ,j, kg to prove that the kill
ing was accidental. The attorn* 5
the defendant also attempted to prove
that the prosecuting witness hud made
threai â ' the life of Desirello and
that he was actuated by spite and ani
mosity in making the complaint.
Dr Ross testified as to the cause of
death. He held an autopsy upon the
of the deceased and found that the
bullet had entered, about three inches
the lobe of the right ear and
came out at about the same relative
on on the left side. The jugular
, ,c severed and death was caused
by shock and hemorrhage.
â  John Vaocari, the young man who
Iriving the wagon on the night of
told how he. Johnston
and Jensen were driving to Belii's store.
As he was crossing the switch of the
electric railroad near the White House
lie noticed a man st^p out into the mid
dle of the track and then back again.
Their horses were going at an ordinary
trot â "neither too fast nor too slow,"
as he put it. The man he saw said
nothing whatever to him and made no
motion. The horses were und^r perfect
control and were trotting not over six
miles an hour. He could have stopped
them easily within a yard or two. The
boys were making no noise or dis
turbance of any kind. Almost imme
diately after the man Cwho, it Is ad
mitted, was Desirello) stepped back a
phot was fired, which struck the front
wheel of the wagon. A second and
then a third shot were fired. By this
time they were about at Belii's store.
It was then that James Johnston said

to him: "Jack, I'm shot." They pulled 1
up the horses in front of the store and j
Johnston jumped from the wagon and ;
grasped a railing on the porch of the j
store to keep from falling. Desire.io
then came up and caught the wounded j
boy as he was falling. The witness
asked Desirello what he shot at them j
for, he said.
"Fred, you knew who we were. \V c
were doing no harm. Why did you
shoot at us?"
Desirello replied, "Phut your mouth
or I'll put a bullet through you, too.'
Desirello's wife, who was at Colma,
came up on the scene, and said:
"Fred, what have you done? Have
you killed a man?" .
"Yes; and I shot to kill," he replied.
The witness said that a moment later
Desirello corrected himself by saying:
"I shot to kill the horses."
Vaccari testified that some one in the
crowd said a doctor should be sent for.
but that Desirello said it was too late.
He however went to Ocean View, a dis
tance of about one and a half miles and
procured a physician. When he re
turned the boy was dead.
The witness was subjected to a severe
cross-examination but his story with a
few minor exceptions remained un-
shaken. ,
Henry Jensen, the third boy on the
wagon," said he got aboard near the
switch and sat on the left side of the
scat with his back turned to the horses.
He not iced a man step out into the
track and back again. He thought ho
recognized him as Desirello from the
hat he wore. As soon as the man
stepped back he saw him throw his
hand to his back pocket a-s though
reaching for a revolver. Immediately
a first shot was fired, and he could dis
tinctly see the flash of the revolver.
He saw the flash of a second shot, the
bullet passing close to his head. When
the third shot was fired they were al
most at the store and it was then he
heard Johnston say he was shot. So
far as he could see or hear Desirello
neither called to them to stop nor made
any motions to stop them. He did not
see Desirello run along trying to stop
the horses, and, besides, the horse? were
not traveling fast. He corroborated
Vaccari regarding everything that was
said and done at the store after Desir
ello came up.
Daniel Neville, the Constable, testi
fied that Desirello gave himself up and
surrendered his revolver and asked to
be taken to Redwood City. James
Crowe, the Coroner, produced the wea
pon that caused the death.
Here the prosecution rested its case,
and after a short recess "William Mur

defense. He was with Desirello on tho
night in question and at the time of
the shooting. He said the defendant
ordered the boys to halt, as they were
going at a rapid rate, the horses being

Late to-night it was found that six
people who were In the building when
the fire broke out were missing, and

igniting the inflammable material with
which the machines are fed. The

and in three minutes the entire flo<rr
was dense with blinding black smoke.
Men and women left their posts in
frantic rushes to the exits. Many ran
to windows and descended by the flre
escapes, but most groped through the
smoke to the first floor and out the cor
ner entrance.
Jeremiah Steele was bending over his
carding machine when the blaze broke
out. Stifled by the smoke, he staggered
to a window, swung himself over the
sill and held by his ringyrs. Mean
while firemen stretched a net and
shouted to Steele to drop. He did bo,
but crashed to the stone sidewalk.
The Armour felt works burned out
nearly a year ago-. It was replaced by
a substantial five-story structure, 112
by 225 feet, which was completed only
last August. Equipped with special
reference to fire protection in the way
of construction and exterior flre es
capes, the total destruction worked by
to-day's blaze was a source of keen re
gret to the owners. The loss is total.
The insurance is $300,000.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CAT,!,, TUESDAY, IVIABCH 28, 1899.
O'CONNELL SPEAKS
ON AMERICANISM
Special Correspondence of The Call and
New York Herald.
ROME, March 10.â I have been for
tunate enough to have a long talk
to-day with Monsignor O'Connell,
formerly rector of the North Amer
ican College, who is an intimate
friend of Monsignor Ireland and of Mon
signor Keane, who has always been one
of the most fervent apostles of American
ist doctrines. I wished to know what was
the interpretation that this prelate gave
to the letter of the Holy Father on Amer
icanism, and the opinions he was kind
enough to give me on this subject are all
the more valuable inasmuch as they may
be considered as a reflection of the opin
ions of the Archbishop of St. Paul and of
the high dignitaries of the Catholic
church in the United States who have
embraced the doctrines of Father Hecker.
"The question," he said to me, "is not
as obscure or as complicated as it may
appear at first sight. The confusion
which has arisen is due entirely to the
passions which have been stirred up
around it, in Europe more than anywhere
else. Heckerism has been confounded
with Americanismâ that is to say, they
are two things standing entirely without
the other, and one may disappear with
out the -other, the other ceasing to exist."
''Has not the Pope's letter condemned
them all?"
"On the contrary, it condemned certain
theories formulated by Father Hecker.
but it cannot be said that It absolutely
reproved Heckerism as a whole. If one
wishes to be more precise, it may be said
the Pope has censured the exaggerations
which Father Hecker's biographers in
troduced into his doctrine, which were
condemned by AmericanistÃ themselves
long before the august word of the Holy
Father had enlightened them, but the
fundamental work of Father Hecker re
mains intact, and the Pope's letter recog
nizes its legitimacy as far as the Paulist
fathers are concerned."
"Then you do not think that the Paul
ist fathers were condemned "
"It does not become me to judge. I
limit myself to reading and meditating
on what the Holy Father has written.
If there are persons who prefer to unite
in a society without binding themselves
by vows there is no obstacle in the way
of their following their vocation, for this
manner of living is not new in the tra
ditions of the church and is not repre
hensible. Only they must refrain from
placing this conception of community life
in antagonism to other religious orders.
That is what the Holy Father has writ
ten You see, therefore, that the Paulist
fathers may live and prosper with the
approbation of the church and the Holy
Father."
"But they may not assume a position
antagonistic to religious orders?"
"YOU have put your linger on the knot
of the controversy. Those who in Amer
set out to exaggerate the tendencies
of ll.ckerism before letting it be judged
in Europe and those who from this side
of the Atlantic regard it with European
prejudice said: â¢Americanists combat our
religious orders, which they consider as
the creation of the middle ages. They re
proach monastic vows with suppressing
Individuality ana consequently they at
tempi to destroy what Europe considers
an essentially religious institution. Con
â¢ntly they are heretics.'
"But this reasoning is founded on false
promises. In the l.nited States there ex
isLs nothing descended from the middle
ages! What, therefore, is the good of
thinking of destroying what does not ex
ist The product of that soil is exclu
sively indigenous and contemporary;
everything springs forth spontaneously
from the customs and spirit o. the age
and tends to form instiUK.ons appropri
ate to the people and to our time, ana not
to overthrow what has never taken root
""The conclusion is plain. The letter of
the Holy Father reproves those who deny
the good and legitimacy of European re
ligious orders, and Americans have no
kind of reason to feel under the ban of

THE POPE PLEASED
BY THE LETTER OF
NEW YORK BISHOPS
NEW YORK, March 27.â There was issued an official statement in
regard to the letter sent on March 10 last by the Roman Catholic
Bishops of the province of New York to the Pope, expressing their
gratitude for the letter the Pope sentfto this country regarding what
is called "Americanism." In the letter the Bishops said:
"The Bishops receive and accept such letter, word for word, sen
tence for sentence, and in the sense intended by the holy father, which
is no other than the sense of the universal church of all ages. Hence
forth we will regard these questions as settled. Thanks to his Holiness,
the hybrid theories to which the name of Americanism nas been given
died almost at their birth.
"This misconception being removed, the true Americanism is. for us
the subject of pride and glory. "We glory in it because our nation is
great in its institutions, in its enterprises, in its development, in its
untiring energy; but when we come to speak of religion, of dogma, of
discipline, of Christian morality and perfection we take equal pride in
being faithful followers of the Holy See."
The letter concluded with the wish that his Holiness may be spared
for many years to see with his own eyes the happy results of his
watchful care and apostolic benevolence.
By direction of the holy father. Cardinal Rampolla, Secretary of
State, has written to Archbishop Corrigan, under date of March 14, to
acknowledge the receipt of the dutiful address which the Paulist Fath
ers forwarded to Rome on February 28, through his hands, and to ex
press the special pleasure and satisfaction which this document has
afforded his Holiness.
this reproof. They have Paullst Fathers.
Now on this point the Holy Father lo-
I cutus est. They form a religious society
I without the obligation of vows and the
chief of the church has said to them that
they are not to be reproved for that."
"It seems to me. however, that all these
considerations belong to the question of
active or passive virtues."
"Precisely. Now, if there exists in the
United States a religious order which
does not exact from its members vows
Imposing the practice of passive virtues
and the obedience usque ad mortem
wisely recalled in the letter of the Su
preme Pontiff, it does not follow that we
should deny the sacredness of passive
virtues and" supernatural virtues.
"Yet has not the Holy Father written
that he disapproves so-called American
isÂ»n?"
--That is a side of the question we have
not yet touched upon. Up to the present
we have spoken only of Heckerism.
i 'Americanism' is another thing alto
' gether The Pope has condemned cer
tain theories, which In Europe pass
under the name of American Catholicism,
but these theories are not those which the
\merican Bishops profess. True Ameri
canism has for its cornerstone that same
truth which Leo XIII indicated as being
the foundation of the churchy I follow
only Jesus Christ and am bound in fellow
ship to your Holiness-that is to say to
the chair of St. Peter. Upon this rock I
have built the church and whoso gather
! eth not with you scattereth.
"American Catholics have diametncally
opposed other Catholics who wished to
create in America a different church from
that which embraces all countries, and
when German-Americans tried to na
tionalize the administration and to take
from the church of the I mted States its
character of universality, C ardinal Gib
bons Monsignor Ireland and Monsig#or
Keane opposed this attempt in order to
preserve the unity of the Catholic church
in the United States in conformity with
the instructions of the Holy Father.
"This concerns, if I am not mistaken,
the nationality, while the judgments pro
nounce.! by Leo XIII on 'Americanism
concern the doctrine."
"Even from that point of view the Holy
Father has declared himself with wisdom
as lofty as it Is impartial. I advise you
to read again the declaration which Mon
signor Keane made on this subject In a
recent interview: 'Truth is one and un
changeable, while temperaments, cus
toms, places and spirit of times vary.
Mayor Mason of
Portland Is Dead
PORTLAND, Or.. March 27.â Mayor
W. S. Mason died this morning. He was
twice elected to the Mayoralty. His
first term began in 1891, when Port
land, East Portland aond Albina were
consolidated into one municipality. He
served three years. He was re-elected
Mayor last June, his personal popular
ity and integrity giving him a large
majority over the three opposition can
didates combined. Mr. Mason was pres
ident of the Chamber of Commerce for
a number of years. He organized and
was president of the Portland National
Bank, which met disaster in 1893. Mr.
Mason put up over $100,000 of his pri
vate fortune and saved depositors from
loss.
Services over the body of Mayor Ma
son will be held in this city to-morrow
at the First Presbyterian Church, and
immediately afterward the body will be
taken on board the steamer Columbia
for San Francisco. The Columbia prob
ably will arrive in San Francisco on
Friday morning
Mayor Mason was a member of Gold
en Gate Commandery, Knights Tem
plar, and it is by his oxpress wish that
this organization will take charge of his
funeral, in San Francisco. The body
will be interred in Masonic Cemetery,
San Francisco, beside his two sisters.
W. S. Mason came to San Francisco
in 1876 from Illinois, where he had been
connected with th<^ freierht department
<>f the Illinois Central Railroad. Soon
after his arrival he made the ac
quaintance of Peter Donahue, and Mr.
Donahue at once became strongly at
tached to him. He gave him the posi
tion of general freight agent nf the old
San Francisco and North Pacific fiail
way. Later the Omnibus Road was
about to find him. and thus prevented

DEPOSITORS WILL BACK
THE COMMERCIAL BANK
Pledged Their Support to the Extent
of $250,000 Yesterday.
SAN LUIS OBISPO. March 27.â A meet
ing of the stockholders, depositors anrt
customers of the closed Commercial Bank
was held here to-day, the object being
to talk over the situation and if possible
arrive at some conclusion "toward reopen
ing the concern. About 200 were present.
The president of the bank, McD. R. Vena
ble, made a speech, explaining that per
mission had been secured from the Rank
Commissioners to resume business and all
that was needed was tlfe assistance ot
the depositors, who were invited to come
forward and sign an agreement to the
effect that for the next ten months they
would only withdraw their deposits at
the rate of 10 per cent of such deposit
each month, thereby giving the bank an
opportunity to fully recover.
Henry Brunner of San Francisco, a
large stockholder In the bank, follower
"Well read the Pope's letter. It says
textually: Discipline of life does not ex
clude temperaments suggested by diver
sity of time and place, and the Holy
Apostolic See is ever inclined to modify
discipline so well that without injuring
divine right he never neglected to take
into account customs and exigencies
which result from immense diversity of
peoples subject to this discipline."
"American Catholics, therefore, only
apply principles, which have constantly
prompted the conduct of the Holy See.''
"If I have a good memory Monsignor
Keane said, that American Catholics do
not fear the spirit of the age, the ten
dencies of which, on the contrary, they
are disposed to favor."
"That is true. Now read once more
the pontifical letter: 'It is far from our
intention to repudiate the fruit of genius
of our age, for, on the contrary, we see
with pleasure truths acquired by study
and all sound fruits of sound activity
add to the patrimony of science and
widen the horizon of human toil.'
"The Pope thus recognizes the legiti
macy of the most determined and mÂ»st
fruitful principle of Americanism, and
American Catholics may be proud at
finding that, on this point, their con
sciences are in perfect harmony with the
doctrines proclaimed by their infallible
chief."
"But the words which you have just
quoted do not relate to preaching, which
in America they wish to do freely, even
outside the churches."
"Even on this point we are not out of
harmony with pontifical precepts. Leo
XIII wrote Cardinal Gibbons that with
the approval of the Hierarchy religious
propaganda may be conducted elsewhere
than In churches."
"You, therefore, find it logical that Mâ¢r.
Ireland addressed to the Pope his letter
of submission."
"Whatever was the judgment of the
Ho!;- Father, the duty of every good
Catholic was to bow before the word of
truth, but the discharra of this duty must
have been ail thÂ«- more easy to M.er. Ire
land, as the truths proclaimed by the
supreme pontiff are in entire conformity
with those which American Catholics
have always practiced."
"You consider, in brief, that American
ism has not been condemned."
"The only condemnations have been er
rors which certain fanatics had put in
circulation under the name of American
ism. They had forced the phantom of
heresy. The Pope swept away the phan
tom and has made the truth shine."
started and Mr. Mason undertook the
extra burden of superintendent of that
line, &long with his other duties. This
class of -work was altogether new to
him, but being a thorough railroad man
he soon picked up enough about the
business to make him a successful
manager. In 18S2, finding his duties
rather arduous, he resigned his position
in this city to go into business in Port
land. His work on the railroads was
greatly appreciated by Mr. Donahue,
who always spoke of him as the best
railroad man In the country.
and assured the depositors that If they
would agree to the above conditions suf
ficient money would be provided to re
open the bank.
Nearly every depositor present then
signed the agreement. The shareholders
later held a private meeting and decided
to open the concern some time next week.
Deposits to the amount of $250, i)00 wer*
signed for to-dny. There was every evi
dence of good feeling at the meeting and
when the bank opens it will receive the
heartiest support.

MR. SWIFT SAYS
GENERAL EAGAN
WAS MISTAKEN
Controversy Between Beef Con
tractor and Commissary as
to the Meat Supplied.
WASHINGTON, March 27.â The Mil
itary Court of Inquiry appointed by the
President to make an investigation of
the b.^ef furnished the army during the
Spanish war has returned to Washing
ton, and at 2 o'clock to-day resumed
its sittings here. The members of the
commission are hopeful that they will
be able to conclude their work within
the next ten days, and expect to have
some important witnesses before them
in that time, including General Eagan,
who will be recalled. It is also ex
pected that General Miles will be given
an opportunity to testify.
E C Swift, vice president of the Swift
Packing Company, was the first witness
who appeared. He is a resident of Low
ell, Mass., and gives especial attention to
' the Eastern interests of his company. He
I assisted in preparing the contract for
supplying beef for Cuba during the war,
I coming to Washington for that purpose
first on June 23. Mr. Swift said he start
ed to Washington in response to a re-
I quest from General Eagan when .it ap
peared that his firm had made the lowest
bid The conversation with General Eagan
on this occasion was somewhat general,
relating to the conduct of business. He
was here only a day and was told before
| he left that the contract would be award
ed to his firm. General Eagan had, how-
I ever stated at that time that he could
1 not go into details with him until he could
! make some necessary investigation as to
I suitable ships. Mr. Swift made his second
' visit to Washington on the 29th of June,
1 when the contract was submitted to him.
i He had then made some objections to the
i terms of agreement as presented to him.
S One of these objections was to the terms
: which he thought might require the beef
; company to deliver beef by lighter, he
complaining that the company could not
; reasonably be expected to deliver at only
such points as had railroad tracks along
i side the wharves. It was also understood
: that beef was to be supplied only to the
i port towns, the inland points to be fur
j nished with beef killed in the country.
They were to keep on hand a sufficient
; supply for seventy hours' consumption.
this time to be extended twenty-four
hours under special exactions. Shore re
frigeration was contemplated in all the
: conversation and with this understanding
that this was to be had the company had
, agreed that the quality of the beef should
,be maintained for three days and nights.
In response to a question from Major
' Lee, Mr. Swift stated that General Eagan
Bad during the interview with him men
tioned that he had received some BUg
j gestion of a process for preserving- meat,
but General Eagan did not g> Into de
tails, giving no names of the inventor nor
of the process.
Maior Lee then stated that General

for seventy hours after leaving the re
FLOOD WATERS
ARE RECEDING
No Danger Along the
Sacramento.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CUtLUSA. March 27.â The Sacramento
River is falling slowly. The lowlands
on the east side of the river are flood
ed. There will be no damage to crops,
as the water will recede soon. At 9
o'clock last night the fire bell rang for
a break in the levee. The citizens an
swered the alarm immediately. The
break was found to be at the water
works. The engine and pump room was
flooded. The water rushed through
with terrific velocity. It entered the
residence of Mrs. A. Bond, and through
an alley found its way into the street.
The men piled sacks into the break
and stopped it. If the break had oc
curred one hour later the water works
would have been ruined.
WOODLAND, March 27.â A telephone
message from Knights Landing this
morning reports that the Sacramento
River is 16 feet 2 inches at that point
and slowly falling. There is no further
danger of overflow. Land owners are
confident there is not more than half
as much water on reclamation district
No. 108 now as there was after the
freshet last January. A full supply of
fuel was received on Sunday and the
pump was started Sunday afternoon.
The basin will be entirely free from
flood water in a few days. "Doc"
Boyer, who is farming extensively on
Grand Island, is in this city. He is
confident that all danger is past and
that the area of grain which will be
destroyed by flood water will be com
paratively small. He expects the tule
lands will yield big crops this season.
From Knights Landing down the only
crevasse on the west bank of the river
is what is known as the Woods break.
That is above the mouth of Feather
River, and consequently, before the
meeting of the last Legislature, was
not within the jurisdiction <>f the de
partment of public works. Every pos
sible effort was made to induce, the
land owners to dose the break. Most
of them were willing to do so and mm
who "Have no land on the river bank,
offered to subscribe liberally. Some of
those who would have reaped the most
benefit from such work refused to give
anything and the project was necessar
ily abandoned.
A large volume of water is now run
ning out of the Woods break and as a
result a great deal of excellent farm
ing land in that vicinity will be ren
dered prctieally useless for this sea
son. Any one of the principal land
owners will lose more than it would
have cost to fill in the break and con
struct a levee. This flood water will
encroach on considerable pasture land
northeast of Woodland. The general
opinion is that it will not seriously in
terfere with farming operations on the
strip of land along the river, or the
Swingle or Martin farms near Swingle
Station. Neither will it reach Solan"
County in sufficient volume to do seri
ous damage.
THE THISTLE NOT LOST.
Missing Sloop Seen at Anchor in a
Northern Harbor.
VICTORIA. B. C, March 27.â There
seems a strong likelihood that after all
the Ford-Thames party of nine reported
lost with the sloop Thistle between Alert
Bay and Hornby [aland is safe. A ser
geant of the provincial police saw Ford's
sloop at North End Island on March 9,
Ford having gone north to pilot some

frigerator and either on shipboard or on
shore.
"1 can only say," responded Swift,
"that General Eagan at the time of the
interview seemed to have the same un
derstanding of the contract that I had.
in view of his testimony I can only say
that he was mistaken."
.Major Lee asked; "Then the insertion,
Of the clause limiting to twenty-four
hours the time for fresh beef after" being
taken out of the refrigerator was not a
clerical error, as suggested by the gen
eral?"
'That cannot be so. Ho said his agents
would tukr- care to preserve the meat
from the sun. and I assured him that if
this were done the meat would be good
for twenty-four hours after being taken
from the refrigerator."
Swift continued by saying that refrig
i beef in a torrid country would
keep good longer than an ordinary person
would think it good, on account of the
outside appearance. As a consequence of
his representations, the first draft of the
contract had been changed by General
Eagan in several particulars.
Swift said in reply to a question that
tfte dressed beef export business was
growing rapidly at the expense of the ex
portation of live cattle. There was. ho
said, a super-demand abroad for refrig
erated beef, and in London this beef waa
supplied to the best trade.
Charles E. Barry, traveling salesman
for Swift & Co.. followed Swift. He testi
fied to his participation in the negotia
tions with General Eagan to secure the
army contract, saying he had met the
genera] several times on rhis subject, the
first meeting being in May of last year
before the issuance of the' advertisement
for bids. He also understood that the
seventy-two hour clause applied only to
the time that the beef was to be kept in
the refrigerators on shore. There was
an especial understanding with General
Eagan as to the twenty-four hour clause,
limiting the time which the beef could be
kept our of the refrigerator, he agreeing
that it should be kept considerably under
cover.
Barry related that on one day when he
was in General Easran's office, prior to the
letting of the contract, the later com
plained of the number of people who were
writing letters to him concerning the
"processing" of beef. The general had
then handed him a letter from a Mr.
Powell of New York, who claimed to have
a process for prf serving meat, saying he
had shipped beef prepared under it to
points in the Southern States.
"li struck me." said Barry, "from Gen
eral Kazan's behavior that he was dis
gusted -At the thought. He said he wai
depending upon the refrigerator beef and
would only deal with those who could
furnish it."
After hearing Barry, the court at 5:30
o'clock held a brief executive session and
then adjourned until to-morrow.

that it goes down to bed-rock and cures the
disorders that are responsible for the ma-
jority of serious illnesses. It strengthens
the stomach, and makes the appetite keen
and hearty. It invigorates the liver. It
aids the natural processes of secretion and
excretion. It makes the assimilation of
the food perfect. It purifies the blood
and fills it with the life-giving elements
that build new and healthy flesh tissue. It
tones the nerves. It is the great blood-
maker and flesh-builder. It cures 93 per

also an unfailing remedy for all nervous

In this the minority report was attacked
and the claim was made, that its Undines
were based on false premises. It holds
that the price charged for lighting is nu
higher, when the difference in conditions

these was the pledge to reduce the price

his questions at Supervisor Collins, who
dodged them, saying he did not know if
they were in the platform he had signed;
he could not remember. Mr. Collins said
he took the stand that it was not proper
to act on decisions of the Superior Court

should wait until the highest tribunal had

Supervisor Deasy thought the gas com-

urging had no effect, tho majority report,
maintaining .the present price of gas, be
ing adopted. Supervisor Deasy changed
his vote from no to aye and will move for
a reconsideration of tho matter at the i
next meeting. i
Supervisor Perrault endeavored to have i
a new resolution fixing the price of gas j
at ?1 35 per thousand adopted, but the
majority defeated it on the ground that
they did not want to vote on it while I
there was any litigation regarding it
pending. The matter was finally post
poned until Gas Inspector Tupper can
I make a report. This will be presented at
the next meeting.. 'â 
The Building Committee reported ad
versely on the offer of the Mutual Elec
tric Light Company to furnish incan
descent light to the city 40 per cent cheap- \
er than the price now being paid for the
same service. The committee held that
no action should be taken until the Su
preme Court has passed on the validity or
the present contract. , *
The report says the matter of a munici
pal lighting plant, as presented by Civil
Engineer A. M. Hunt, will solve the prob
lem. This will remedy the present dim- ;
culties if inaugurated by the city.
The committee recommends the. board to ;
advertise for proposals for the building
of a police station and furnishing the ;
Hall of Justice so soon as modified plans ;
are received from Architect Shea.
A discussion as to the underground â 
wires in the tire limits and the granting i
of all light companies the right to erect
poles outside those limits ended the con
sideration of the lighting question. Both i
propositions were referred to the Street ;
Committee. Dr. Perrault. who introduced I
the resolutions, explained that he wanted
to place the Mutual Electric Light Com
pany on a competitive basis, so that there
would be a chance for competition when
the next contract for lighting is let. The
resolutions would permit all companies to ,
lay wires. Unless this Is done. Supervisor
Lackmann explained. It would be. a farce
to advertise for bids for lighting.
The members of the board would not
accept the proffered resignation of Dr.
Perrault as chairman of the Finance
Committee. He pressed the matter, but
the board declined to consider it, appre
ciating his usefulness to the city on tna^
committee. He was highly complimented
for his efficient services.
The deplorable condition of the Pest
house was called to the attention of the
board by Dr. Perrault. As the members
had already read in The Call of the un
necessary suffering of the unfortunate in
mates but little time was wasted in dis
cussion. It was determined that the j
members of the Building Committee and
also the Hospital Committee would visit
the place and determine what repairs are
required. A report will be presented at
the next ting of the board, at which
time steps will be taken to relieve the

The. many attempts being made by alleged

which will not be paid by them. we hope will
not succeed. The taxes now collected are
sufficient tor all ordinary public uses, and
fully 000,000 could be saved by curtailing
some of the useless expenditures. The re

pose â the increase of the tax rateâ should
be denied at once, and these schemes thus
disposed of peremptorily.

THE LAUNCH AMY AS SHE WAS AND AS SHE IS.
THE Amy was raised from the bottom of the bay yesterday and placed on Peterson's barge by the tug
Alert. The hull shows the peculiar course the explosion took. The gasoline tank was forward of the
engine and the engine was a little forward of amidship. The deck was blown clean off. The bow of the
launch was split, but not otherwise damaged to any great extent. The engine escaped and the explosion
must have jumped clean over it and shattered the stern. The latter is all torn away, and the wonder is
that the boat floated for an instant after the accident. Looking at the recovered hull the mystery as to
how Captain Wilson escaped with a few burns is all the greater. The engines will be kept for future use
and the hull broken up.

PLATT ON EXPANSION.
The Well-Known Attorney Lectures
Before the Forum Club.
A large audience gathered last night at
Â°Â°3 Sutter street to hear Horace G. Platt
deliver a lecture under the auspices of the
Forum Club. He took for his subject the
timely topic of "Expansion" and handled
it in a way to excite the interest of his
auditors.
"War with Spain," he said, ' came like
a midnight alarm of fire, and our men.
were quick to enlist in the service of their
c.ountrv. The flag of America now waves
where "the red and yellow flag once float
ed and mark* the deathbed of Spain. We
went into that war to put an end to man a
inhumanity to maji. Now that the.Amer
ican flag has been planted in the soil of
Cuba and the Philippines, which have
been made red with the blood of our sol
diers, it should never be lowered.
â¢â¢Tlv result of the war has been the ac
quiring of new possessions by the United
States, and we mjust accept the responsi
bilities now placed upon us. It has been
called imperialism to favor territorial ex
pansion. If it be so our hand is at the
plow and we must furrow to the end. \Ve
must steer our bark by the star or dcs-
tiny. This now territory now belonging
to tho I'nited States will be governed an
CongTess dictates, and Congress alone
will solve the momentous problem."

NO WORD FROM
THE MINERS ON
KOTZEBUE SOUND
Non-Arrival of Ex
pected Letters.
KNIGHT COMMANDER AGAIN
TJNTORTUNATE BARK SHOUT OF
PBO VISIONS.
The Overdue Dominion Supposed to
Be Lost â Brutus Will Carry Coal
to Guam â Nero to Make
Surveys.
1 The first vessel to leave for points north
of St. Michael this year will be the bark
Alaska. She will sail for Golovin Bay,
Port Clarence and Kotzebue Sound about
May 1, and on her return will probably
i bring the first authentic news from those
! points.
Over eight hundred gold miners win
tered on the rivers emptying into Kotze
bue Sound, but since the return of the
i Alaska last y< ar not a word has been
! heard from them. Every one of the men
had two years' supplies with him, and
besides two well stocked stores were es
tablished on the Kuburk River, so there
was no chance of anybody starving-, but
; those who are interested in that region
j are wondering that no news has been
! sent out. "No news," they say, "is good
news," and the general supposition is
that the men have been too busy pros
pecting to send messengers out with news.
Among those who made arrangements to
have information sent out were Lynde &
Hough, Charles D. Lane, the millionaire
mining man, and Captain B. Cogan,
! owner of the bark Alaska. They havo
' been expecting letters all of this month,
but are Ktill in the dark as to what has
been discovered on the rivers of Kotze
bue Sound.
When Captain Cogan left the gold hunt
ers last year the majority of them were
at Cogan's camp, twenty miles beyond
Fort Cosmos. They were then heading
for the Par River and the headwaters of
the Kubuck. In October the ground
would be frozen hard, and then prospect
ing down to bedrock could be done. If
gold in paying quantities was not found
it was the intention of 200 of the gold
hunters to make a three days" journey
overland to the Koyukuk River, where
gold was known to abound. Now news
has i n received from the miners on the
Koyukuk three or four times since last
October, but not a word about any men
having gone over from the Kubuck.
Of those who did not go up to Fort Cos
mos nearly all took up claims on the
Ruckland River. Among these was John
D. Tallant, the banki-r, and they found
traces of gold from the roots of the grass
down, but could not reaoh bedrock until
the ground froze in the winter. Letters
and parcels for the gold hunters are ar
riving dally from all parts of California
and the East, and these will go north on
the Alaska next May.
"It looks to me very much as though
the boys have struck gold and were too
busy to send out a messenger," said Cap
tain Cogan yesterday. "Or they may
have nil been so busy that no one could
bo persuaded to make the journey. One
thing is certain, there will be no starva
tion, as everybody was well supplied with
provisions and there Is fish and game In
abundance. I am certain that T will find
them all well when I get there in June.
At Golovin Bay they have found gold,
and when the Alaska gets there I suppose
wo will get some news."
The British bnrk Knight Commander is
in trouble again. She was spoken on
March 2." by the German steamer Africa
and supplied with provisions. This is the
second time she has run out of supplies.
She left Puget Sound early in last De
cember for Belfast, and when in the vi
cinity of Cape Horn the provisions ran
out. The crew was down to starvation
rations when th" captain managed to
make Port Stanley. Tho supplies received
there were neither extensive nor varied,
but the men had to put up with them
until the Africa was met with on the 25th
Inst.
The Knight Commander was formerly
a ship and has been more or less unfort
unate since her launching. In July, 1873
while on her way from San Francisco
to Newcastle, N. S. \\\, her decks were
swept and everything movable washed
overboard. All the livestock aboard were
drowned and the cabin flooded. In March,
1874, while on her way from San Fran
cisco to Liverpool she lost all her boats
and a suit of sails was blown away. Two
years later while on her way to Calcutta
she was dismasted, and a couple of years
later nearly all her crew died of yellow
fever.
On July 31, 1891, the Knight Commander
met with her worst luck. She was
caught in a hurricane and had to put
into Falkland Islands with her rudder
pintles gone and otherwise so damaged
that her cargo had to be discharged for
repairs. While the ship was being over
hauled many of the crew were taken sick
and died and others ran away on ships
that put in for supplies. The captain
wont to Montevideo and secured a second
crew, but some of them died on the way
to Port Stanley and upon reaching that
place it was found that two of the aii
Â£m n i' Â£ had , fallen from aloft and bee
tilirtL"n Enough men were got from Mon
tevideo to give the ship a full complement
EH? Â« a start was maae for San Francisco,
but she was caught in another storm and
a iv- to ;. put hack lnt Â° 'Stanley with her
rudder damaged.
:Jr ci" l^, 1168 ; the . Knight Commander
left San Francisco for Cork and she was
caught in more heavy weather off the
Horn. In fact, the news reached Eng
land that she had foundered and the ves
sel was given up for lost. She reached
her destination _ in safety, however, and
after that her rig was changed to a 'bark
Since then her accidents have been minor
ones, but she never seems to be able to
pass Port Stanley without putting" in
there. To even up the ill luck of the
Knight Commander her sister ship the
Knight Companion, has been almost a
uniform success.
The ship Erskine M. Phelps will Bail for
Honolulu to load. sugar for New York in
a day or so. She came off the Union
Iron Works dry dock yesterday and went
to Harrison street wharf, where she will
take in ballast. The Phelps will take no
freight but will carry a number of pas
sengers. Captain Graham experts to
make the run down in from ten to twelve
The British ship Dominion, which left
Honolulu for Pugot Sound seventy days
ago, is about given up for lost There
was 9Â° per cent reinsurance offered on her
yesterday but no takers. Indians report
a wreck on QuoÂ«-n Charlotte Sound, and
by some people this is thought to be the
ill-fated vessel. Others again are of the
opinion that the Dominions ballast
shifted and the vessel went down in a
hurricane. , '
The United States collier Brutus is to
come down from Mare Island this work
to load Cardiff coal for Guam. She wi 1
take 4500 tons of the same kind of black
diamonds that the Oregon was Bupplied
with when sho made her famous voyage
around the Horn. The Brutus will sail
about April 8. The Nero is also coming

She will go to Honolulu and will be used

EVANGELIST MOODY'S
FAREWELL LECTURE
SPOKE AT THE FIRST CONGRE-
GATIONAL CHURCH.
Fully Two Thousand People Crowded
Into the Sacred Edifice to
Hear His Parting
Words.
Evangelist Moody preached again yes- |
terday afternoon from trie pulpit of the
First Congregational Church. Fully two
thousand crowded into the edifice and re
mained attentive until Mr. Moody ceased
to speak. About thirty ministers of the
gospel occupied seats on the platform, and
to them, not as individuals but as a
body. Moody pave advice.
"The day is past," said the evangelist,
"when a man of God should endeavor to |
expound his own theories and moralize on
the words of God. Let him teach his flock
the Bible from beginning to end. Christ's
words need no explanation. They are
written in black and white in the holy |
book, and it should be the desire of a mm- ;
ister more thrtn anything < Use to impress (
the importance of studying the Bible on .
those whom he has undertaken to lead to \
heaven.
"This habit of taking a text from the
Bible an a t>LiHin for a sermon and after i
readinfi -t to hi.s congregation overlook it I
altogetl to soar into oratorical flights ;
of fancy la wrong. Oratorical ministers
are never successful unless they adhere
Strictly to the word of God. It should
not l>e the province of a minister to 'give [
his people something new.' That practice j
is wholly improper. I
"Let him teach his flock from the good
old Bible. Of course I am casting no re- ;
flections on the ministers of California.
I have not had the good fortune to attend
Bervlcea here. 1 will pay. fur Instance,
that the practice exists away back in Ohio
or BOtne other place equally distant from
A minister of the gospel cannot
m.'ik-- any headway in his mission of sav
uls by preaching a twenty-minute
sermon once a week. Why, In Glasgow,
where I lectured for five weeks, I know j
of people who study the Bible for six
and seven hours a day. One minister in i
particular taught the words of God to his
listeners to such an extent that I noticed
his influence wherever I went. I could
pick out any chapter in the Bible and |
nearly everybody in the congregation (
could recite it word for word from mem- j
ory. The words of God are in themselves j
powerful morals and it heeds no minister
to select a few of them and then moraiize ,
oratorlcally on them.
"I have heard a great many people say
both privately and publicly that a person
should never reform suddenly. What a
false doctrine. When a person has real
sorrow for his sins he repents. Now re
pentance is not going down to the bay
and standing in water up to your neck for
a day. My definition of repentance is, |
'Halt; right about face.' That's repent
ance. If a man has his back turned to i
God every step he takes brings him one â¢
step nearer the devil. If he turns his !
back to the devil every step he takes
brings him nearer to Gnd."
In the morning Mr. Moody lectured at
the Young Men's Christian Association.
The evangelist left last night for the East.

Status of the Grain-
Rate Case.
RAILROAD MUST NOW ACT
EXPLANATION OF AN AMBIGU
OUS RESOLUTION.
Commissioner Laumeister Gives His
Understanding of the Peculiar
Proceeding He Officially
Approved.
. v In the matter of the 8 per cent grain
rate reduction question, It is now "up to" ;
the Southern Pacific Company. That cor- j
poration must make the next move if the i
farmers are to receive any benefit from
the action of the Railroad Commisssion
ers at their last meeting, Will the rail- ;
road company dismisses the pending suit ,
and the injunction against the commis- ;
Bion is thereby dissolved, the hands of
the Commissioners are tied so far as
making reductions In rates are concerned.
At the last session of the commission It
passed the lowing resolution:
<J> Now, therefore, it is by the Board of <Â£
<s> Railroad Commissioners of the State of <$>
<g> California ordered and resolved that paid <|-
<â¢> resolution above referred to and set <â¢>
4> forth be and the same is hereby re- <Â§>
<5> scinded. annulled, vacated, set aside and <Â«>
<â¢> repealed. â $>
<J> Provided, however, that the board shall <â¢>
<;â  at the regular meeting In April, IS9B, to <$>
<â¢> wit, on the 10th day of said month, pass <$>
<â¦> and adopt a resolution fixing and pro- <*>
<$â¢ mulgating a schedule of grain rates at â¢$>
<s> least equal to an average reduction of fc <j>
<g> per cent as of date, September 14. l>s>s. >â¢>
When this action was taken by the com
mission It was generally construed to
mean that the commission intended to
abandon the defense of the pending ac
tion brought by the Southern Pacific
Company: that the latter would thereby
pet judgment, would allow the temporary
injunction to be dissolved and would per
mit the commission to put into effect an
Â£ per cent reduction in grain rates, based
en the rates as they existed on September
14, ISM.
Such, however, is not the programme,
a- explained by Commissioner Laumeister
yesterday. The resolution which it is pro
posed to" rescind was adopted by the
former commission, and referred to a -a
per cent horizontal reduction, as well as
to the reduction of 8 per cent on grain
rates. According to Commissioner Lau
meister there has been no rescission of
the resolution of the old board. Its abro
gation was made conditional on the power
of the Board of Railroad Commissioner*
to put Into effect on April 10 a schedule
of rates on grain that would be 8 per cent
less than those that were effective Sep
tember 14 1595. If the Southern Pacific
does not have its suit against the com
mission dismissed and the injunction in
connection therewith dissolved, the com
mission will be in contempt of court if it
should order any reduction in rates In the
meantime. . . Â
Simply stated the commission by its ac
tion has made an offer to the Southern
Pacifk- Company to abandon its action.
under the 25 per cent reduction resolu
tion provided the corporation will bring
about the dismissal of the pending liti
gation, including the injunction, ana pro
vided also that the railroad will agree to
en 8 per cent reduction on grain rates as
they were in force on September 14, 1*95.
The Railroad Commission is now making
the railroad company the same offer that
was made to th*Â» former Railroad Com
mission by the railroad company through
W H. Mills, and the members of tri^ com
mission say there is no understanding be
tween the commission and the Southern
Pacific. -
Had the commission abandoned defense
of the pending suit it would have been lia
ble for costs, thÂ» injunction would have
continued in force and its hands would
have been tied. If the programme as now
outlined is Tied out by the railroad
that corporation will have to foot the ex
penses of the suit, the injunction will
be dissolved, the commission will be free ;
to act and all the issues raised will re
main undecided.

Funeral Will Take Place To-Day at

Laid to Rest in the Ma
sonic Cemetery.
Th* Coroner's Inquest held over the re
mains of poor little Kitty Wannenmacher
showed that the child had come to her
death from a wound accidentally inflicted
by a rifle in the hands of Joseph Muller.
and the verdict of the Coroner's jury whs
"we hereby exonerate the said Joseph
Muller from all blame."
The inquest was held yesterday after
noon at the desolate Wannenmacher
home, 406 Frederick street. The solemn
little band of witnesses assembled in the
dining-ro^m of the house, and in tearful
accents told the details of the merry jest
that resulted so unhappily for all.
Mrs. Wannenmacher was the first wit
ness called. Thf broken-hearted mother
explained how Muller had in mock tierce
; ness raised the rifle that was stu riding in
the corner of the kitchen, whore they
were all assembled, and pointed it at
i Ethel Kempster, the friend and enm
i panion of the dead girl. "Ethel whs
afraid and ran to hide behind Kitty." said
I Mrs. Wannenmacher. "I tried to quiet
, her fears and turned to Joseph Muller and
' told him that the (run was not loaded. At
1 my words he fired and Kitty fell."
Reuben Wannenmacher. the nlne-year
: old brother of Kitty, and Ethel Kempster.
her friend, practically told the same
story of the killing as did the unhappy
mother.
Joseph Muller was the last witness to
be examined, and when he told the sad
part he played in the tragedy his voice
was tear-choked, and" he was so pros
trated that.it was found necessary to sup
| port him while he gave his testimony.
Although the family of the dead girl are
prostrated by grief in the midst of their
I unhappiness. they unselfishly condole with
the unfortunate young Muller.
The funeral of Kitty Wannenmacher
will take, place to-day from the residence
of her parents. KB Frederick street, and
the remains will be laid to rest in the
Masonic Cemetery.

THE SAX FRAKCISCO CALL,, TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1899.
CAN THIS BE
THE CAPE WORN
BY MRS. ADAMS?
An Important Find by
the Police.
TWO WITNESSES CONFLICT
TESTIMONY OF OLIVER COX,
GEARY-STREET GRIPMAN.
How He Saw a Woman Resembling
the Defendant Board His Car
and Ride to Parker
Avenue.
The police believe they have found the
cape that Mrs. Minnie* Adams wore on the
Sunday night, two weeks ago, when she
is alleged to have purchased three ounces
of carbolic acid at Loehr's drug store,
with which to murder her two-year-old
child. John Richard Gray. At least they
have in their possession a cape that an
swers in every detail the description of
the one worn by the mysterious woman
who purchased the poison.
The garment has been inspected by Of
ficer John P. Herlihy, who saw the
woman tear the label from the bottle
while waiting for the car on the corner of
Devisadero and Geary streets; by George
1 Purlenky, who sold the woman the poi
son, ami by Oliver T. Cox, the gripman
â  on the Geary strict cable car. who identi
fied Mrs. Adams as the woman who
boarded his car at 9:02 on that Sunday
night in front of the drug store. All
three say it is the same in appearance
i and texture as that which was worn by
; the woman. They will not. however,
swear that it is the same cape, and in this
, fact the defense will find its only ray of
] hope.
The garment is the property of a mcm
i ber of the Kenney family, whose resi
j dence adjoins the Tyrrell house on Park
er avenue, where Mrs. Adams lived with
her father and brothers. The Tyrrell
house is owned by Mrs. Kenney, and
both she and her daughter have all along
been stanch believers in the innocence
of the accused woman. They still be
lieve she did not kill her child and de
clare positively that the cape which the
police are so elated over finding never
to their knowledge adorned the shoulders
of Mrs. Adams. They are certain that
Mrs. Adams did not borrow It on the
â  Sunday night she is alleged to have pur
chased the carbolic acid at Loehr's drug
store.
Sergeant Duke says It has not been de
i cided to offer the cape in evidence, but
in view of the importance with which
the police appear to regard the tind there
is little doubt that the jury will be given
a chance to examine the garment, hear
j the evidence in connection therewith and
then be asked to form their own opinion
i as to whether it had any connection with
the purchase of the poison that caused
| the death of the murdered child.
"We may not offer the cape In evi
| dence," said St-rgeant Puke last night.
"as v.c may not be able to positively
identify it as the garment worn by Mrs.
Adams when she purchased the poison,
â  but we have plenty of evidence u> convict
her without that, with some to. spare."
The value of the cape as evidence, could
it be positively identified, can be better
' understood when it is recalled that the
! only flaw in Officer Herlihy's positive
i identification of Mrs. Adams as the
woman he saw come from the drug store
, and board the car, as well as in that of
I Cox, was the fact that the woman wore
a cape, while it was shown that Mrs.
I Adams had not owned a Raiment of that
description for at least five years.
There are some discrepancies in the
; points of time on which much of the case
j against Minnie Adams hangs. There is
' a precious seven minutes that may mean
j the difference between conviction and ac
! qulttal, and until that space, of time la
i explained away it will serve as a weak
i spot in the case of the prosecution.
Oliver T. Cox, grlpman on the Geary
street line, is the one responsible for the
discrepancy. He was called at the
preliminary examination yesterday after
l noon to tell how. on the night or
March 12. his car was boarded at Geary
and Devisadero streets by a woman
whom he afterward learned, he says, was
j Minnie Adams. She was standing on
! the corner where the drug store is. and
j as he stopped the car to allow a passen
! ger to get off she got on the dummy and
i sat on the side seat and just behind him.
, I'nx went on to say he noticed the wo
; man particularly, because there was
i standing on the same corner a police
! man who looked after her as the car
' went on and she looked back at him.
Cox looked back also, he says, and then,
being curious to know where the woman
lived, he watched her when she got off
at Parker avenue and saw her go down
toward where other testimony . showed
Mrs. Adams lived. The importance of
this is manifest when it is compared with
the statement made by the woman who
li'iupht carbolic acid from the druggist
on ljevisadero and Geary streets. The I
woman who bought the acid gave her I
name as Mrs. Creighton and her address
as 325 Point Lobos avenue, which was
afterward found to be a vacant lot. Po
liceman Herlihy, who was watching her.
says she was the same woman who
boarded the westbound Geary street car,
supposed to be Cox's car,, and Cox says j
she got off at Parker avenue and walked
toward the Tyrrell house, where Mrs*.
Adams lived.
The seven minutes came In Just there,
however. Cox testified that his car on
the trip during which the woman boarded
it started from Geary and Market streets j
at 8:48 and allowing about fourteen min
utes to arrive at Devisadero street he
figured he got there about 9:02. The rec
ord in the drug store shows the acid to
have been sola to "Mrs. Creighton" at |
5:45, and Policeman Herlihy says that |
after seeing the woman board the car he !
went on to the O'Farrell street station !
and reported there about five minutes
tO 9.
Some one is wrong. Somebody's clock, I
or watch, or memory or something. If j
Herlihy reported to the O'Farrell streev I
station at 8:55, after seeing the woman .
who bought the poison board a west- I
bound car, he reported there seven min
utes before Cox says his car reached De- |
visadero street. Cox, however, says he i
saw Herlihy on the corner and recognized !
him as the woman got on th* ;
dummy, but If he did so and is right as
to his own time, then there is something )
wrong with Herlihy's watch. As for the
drug clerk, Purlenky, he says his clock i 3 i
no good any way.
All this leaves the seven minutes from
8:55, when Herlihy says he reported, to I
9:02, when Cox says "his car arrived at |
Devisadero and Geary streets, in a rather j
debatable situation, and they may prove
precious minutes to the defense.
Herlihy, however, does not pretend to
be positive as to the exact time. He
thinks it was a few minutes before I when i
he reached the station, hut says he may ,
have spent more time watching the wo
man on the corner than he realized.
The hrst witness of the afternoon was
10-year-old Harrison Tyrrell, brother of ]
the defendant. He told how he and his
playmates had found a bottle "behind j
Egan'a barn" and had taken it into their
own yard to play with it. When lirst ex
amined he said he left this bottle in the |
outhouse a minute before the child was i
taken sick. Yesterday he said it was an
hour. He told how there was not much
more liquid in the bottle than there was
when it was given to him yesterday, and
he had to slant the bottle until the small
amount of its contents could gather and
be seen, yet there was carbolic acid Bpilled
over the floor of the outhouse, on the
child's face, on its bib and more bespat
tered its mother's dress, and Still there j
must have been at le.ast a teaspoonful
more than all that to kill the child. It is j
for that reason the prosecution argues
that the bottle found cuts no figure in the
case and the child was killed by the acid
its mother bought the night before.
John F. Flanagan and George Laf'nmbp,
employes of the < 'oroner, were called to
tell how they found the bottle the chil
dren had been playing with; how it was
In the same condition as when they saw
it first; how tney took up the acid
soaked boards from the outhouse and
some paper also saturated; and how the
arid had left its telltale marks upon the
dead rhild's face. Then Cox was called.

O O
Cox told how his car was passing Devis
adero street on Geary on the night of
Sunday. March 12, and how he took on
board as a passenger the woman he after
ward saw in the City Prison, Minnie
Adams. She seemed to be waiting for the
car. he said, and although she made no
signal to him to stop, when he did stop
to allow another woman to get off. she
came out from the sidewalk and boarded
the dummy. It was just as he started on
again that he saw and recognized Herlihy
standing on the corner and watching the
woman. . ,
He described the woman as being
dressed in a dark dress, dark cloth cape
with fur trimmings, and a brown sailor
hat. He refused to commit himself as to
the presence or absence of a veil, and de
clared he had not seen her hair, and then,
in response to the Judge's query, he point
ed out the defendant as the woman wno
had been his passenger.
It was on cross-examination that tne
seven unaccounted-for minutes were raked
up, although no direct mention was made
of them. Cox was questioned closely as
to the time schedule of the road, and it
was then he said he left Geary and Mar
ket at 8:48. and arrived in time to pick up
the defendant on Devisadero street at
9:02.
Testifying further under cross-examina
tion Cox said when he saw the story of
the child's death in the papers on the
following Tuesday, he thought he recog
nized in the mother his Sunday passen
ger, and he came to th>- prison to see if
she could bo the same. He was allowed
to see her and identified her.
The defense also brought out the inter
esting fact that Cox has now on file in
the enters office an application for a po
sition on the police force.

! Roll voted for ex-Auditor W. F. Parker.
For the past week there has hopn a
great tussle for the Auditorshlp between
the politicians who were deprived of fat
positions by the victory last November
of the reform forces composed of Good
Government Leaguers, Democrats and
Populists. Therr- were no less than a
dozen in the field. "Johnnie" Mackenzie,
who served the county in the useless po
sition of Game Warden. ex-Justice of the
Peace Kirkpatrick and A. L. Sage, chair
man of Hea's county central committee,
were the most prominent candidates.
A great hue arose over the prospective
appointment of Mackenzie, and Rea's
lieutenant withdrew and got the place
for his friend Morrison. Sage remained
in the tight, and now is mad because the
gang "threw him down."
"When the matter was taken up by the
Board of Supervisors four petitions ask
ing for the place were read. Besides
Morrison and Parker. H. Brosius. the
bookbinder, and Charles J. Llghtstone. of
the Assessor's office, asked for the office.
Supervisor Ayer asked if Mrs. Veuve
could n"t be appointed to her husbaud's
place. District Attorney Campbell Said
the law did not provide for a woman
holding the place. Ayer then wanted the
appointee to promise Mrs. Veuve a depu
tyahip, but Chairman Austin ruled this
out of order. Brosius in his petition said
he would give Mrs. Veuve one-third of
the salary of the office and donate $1000
of the remaining two-thirds to the coun
ty to be dispensed in relieving the poor.
'A vote was taken and Morrison re
ceived three votes to Parker's two.
Morrison is at present Police Commis
sioner of this city, He was the gang's
candidate for County Clerk at the late
election and was defeated by H. A. Pfis
ter by the overwhelming majority of
>7~. Fie is well qualified for the place,
however, having for years been cashier
in two of the leading banks of the city.
The salary of the office is $40no a year.

FINANCIERING
FOR HEALTH
What the New Discovery in Medi-
cal Science Proves,
YOUR HEALTH DEPENDS ON YOUR KIDNEYS.
To Test the Merits of Swamp-Root, the
Great Kidney Remedy, Every Reader of
"The Call" May Have a Sample Bot-
tle Sent Absolutely Free by Mail.
If you wish to be rich in health, you should be as careful
of your kidneys as a good financier is of his cash capital.
Your kidneys arc you capital.
Your health depends principally on them.
If you can keep THEM well, you may possess your health in
Safety.
Now, by this is not meant that good financiering for health is
to overlook all the other organs and merely look after the kidneys.
Your other organs may need careâ but your kdineys most, be-
cause they do most.
If you are sick, begin with your kidneys, because as soon as
they are well, they will help all the other organs to health.
The immediate symptoms and first
proofs of weak kidneys are pain or dull
ache in the back, rheumatism, dizzi-
! ness, headaches, nervousness, heart
i trouble, pain in the limbs, bloating, sal-
i low complexion, puffy or dark circles
: under the eyes, bladder irritation, sup-
I pression of urine, obliged to pass water
often day and night, worn-out, tired
feeling, lack of ambition.
If your water, when allowed to re-
main undisturbed in a glass or bottle
for twenty-four hours, forms a sedi-
ment or settling, or has a cloudy ap-
pearance, it is evidence that your kid-
neys and bladder need immediate at-
tention.
Swamp-Root is the great medical tri-
umph of the nineteenth century; dis-
covered after years of untiring effort
and research by the eminent kidney and
bladder specialist. Dr. Kilmer.
It is pleasant to take, and can be pur-
chased at most drugstores or medicine
dealers in fifty-cent or one-dollar bot-
tles.

THE ELECTION OF SENATORS.
AS was to have been expected the Senatorial
deadlocks in so many States have revived public
rest in the problem of effecting some bene
the system of electing Senators. The
miliar one of so amending the
con , - to provide for election by direct vote
of tl as that change will require years
for its accomplishment other proposals have been
in some quarters are strongly advocated.
We directed attention a few days ago to the plan
pro-- Senator Hoar which provides after the
seventh, ba n by a plurality of the Legis
lature instead of by a majority. Xow comes the San
Jose Mercury with another plan. It says:
"Let every political organization at its regular
State convent .ate the party candidate for
This would obviate all uncertainty or
guesswork. * â¦" * The legislative campaign would
t a Senatorial contest, and lor the
I rs it would be a simple matter of choosing be
tween the Republican nominee Smith, or the Demo
cratic nominee Brown or the Populist nominee Jones,
and the party that should elect a majority of the/
-lature would know as soon as the ballots were
just who the next Senator would be. There
would be no doubts, no subsequent wire-pulling, no
deadlock-. - itorial scandals. The Senatorial
candidate whose party controlled the Legislature
would be elected on the first ballot, and the Legisla
ture would be free to proceed with the business of
legislation and perhaps do some good for the people
of the State."
The objections to this plan are obvious. The
nomination of a Senator by State convention would
put that office in the pools along with State offices
and the preferment would go by bargain and log
rolling as do State offices. When accomplished it
would subordinate State issues involved in the elec
tion of legislators to the rivalry of Senatorial candi
dates. Voters who desired the election of a particular
candidate for United States Senator would have to
vote for his legislative ticket whether it were com
posed of good men or not. Moreover the additional
factor introduced into a campaign by the nomina
tion of a candidate for the United States Senate
would increase the danger of dividing a party into fac
tions, if the candidate happened to be unpopular in
some localities, and would to that extent compromise
the rest of the ticket.
It is in every way desirable to have national politics
as separate from State politics as possible, so that
parties will not be able to carry a weak State ticket
into office by linking it to a strong national ticket.
For that reason no satisfactory- solution of the prob
lem of electing United States Senators can be reached
short of their election by direct vote of the people
without reference to the Legislature.
In the meantime, since that consummation is likely
tc be long delayed, it -would be worth while to experi
ment with the plan of the Mercury. Its defects are so
clear upon the surface that they can be guarded
against to some extent, and at any rate they are not
greater than those of the present system. In fact
hardly anything in the way of change could produce
result? worse than the deadlocks and the scandals
that now prevail at Senatorial contests in all parts of
â {he Union.
An elderly woman of Oakland was sent to jail for
having attempted, to pass two bogus nickels. As yet
there is not the slightest reason to think that she sup
posed the coins to be bogus, and the suspicion that
somebody has acted with brutal haste cannot be
avoided.
The race war in the South seems to have reached
such a stage that white boys shoot colored people
just for the sake of getting into practice so when they
grow up their marksmanship will be creditable to an
advanced civilization.
Forger Crecgan has gone to Folsom for two years,
which is considerably milder a dose than the sen
tence of life imprisonment he once received. Yet no
body but Creegan complained that the first sentence
was too severe.
The Oakland man who with money in his pocket
begged free lodgings in which to commit suicide
cd a decidedly mean trick. He should have paid
for the room, and, in decency, for the gas employed.
The Tacoma druggist who while asleep shot and
killed his wife should either refrain from acquiring a
new one or drop the habit of keeping a loaded re
volver under his pillow.
To comment on the latest fool boy who used an
"unloaded" weapon seems almost useless. He will
not loug be the latest fool boy.
As the leader of an army in retreat Aguinaldo seems
to be the right man in the right place.
THE DINNER CAMPAIGN.
THE Democracy will have two dinners of na
tional import in New York. In these the op
posing factions will line up, one at $i and the
other at $io per plate, and eat and drink defiance at
each other. The dollar a plate party will be led by
Colonel Bryan, who with munitions, consisting of
hash and steam beer, will assault the turkey and
champagne position of the ten dollar party, led by
General Richard Croker. It will be a war to the knife
and fork between the house of want and the house of
have. Mr. Croker, who by honest industry has ac
cumulated a fortune without work, will lead his fly
ing columns against the forces of Colonel Bryan, who
has made a living with his jaw. In the ranks of the
latter will fight Mr. Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont,
who recently deserted the mahogany of the ten-dollar
platers and took his place in the one-dollar trenchers.
He has announced that while personally a gold man
he beTicves the country can get along with silver or
any old standard, provided the national banks are
turned over to a lynching committee and judicial de
cisions are rendered in mass-meetings. He also de
sires public ownership of everything the Belmonts are
not dealing in and thinks State communism is the
remedy for everything in sight.
The dollar platers propose to roar against trusts,
and that is right, but the ten-dollar platers will also
roar against trusts and the Republicans have roared
already, so that between roars the simple citizen and
the Man With a Hoe will be confused as to which is
the original and only roar, with the senior caveat,
among the roars which are making every/trust feel
around for its -lawyer and other weapons of defense.
There are grounds for believing that Mr. Croker's
anti-trust roar will be louder than Colonel Bryan's
and the roar of Mr. Belmont. This belief is based on
Mr. Croker's wide and long experience as a roarer.
In the presence of his stentorian sonorosity a bull of
Basha-n would retire crushed and hide his ineffectual
roar in the bushes.
The campaign is being carefully planned. Mr.
Bryan has been practicing on the South and is now
giving his roar a course of the waters at Hot Springs,
for he knows that when it meets Mr. Croker's it will
be up against the real thing.
This beginning of the campaign of 1900 has the
merit of novelty and will attract widespread attention.
The news will be hardly second in interest to the
battle dispatches from the Philippines. At the
Antipodes the strife is for tie conquest of Aguin
aldo's Capitol, which is built of bamboo, while at
home this battle of the banquets is for the
conquest of the Capitol of the republic, which
is built of brick and marble with a dash
of granite and is honeycombed with offices. Mb.
Croker enjoys the advantage of his ownership of
Greater New York, with its Mayor, munitions, muni
ments and merchandise, its taxes, tithes and tolls.
Colonel Bryan's properties and impediments have not
the physical value of Croker"s equipment, but still he
has his martial voice and the copyrighted trademark
cf the Jefferson cigar. He has ted his forces on em
balmed hope and expectation, stale and stringy to be
sure, but very abundant, so that the quality of the
ration is somewhat compensated by the quantity.
RAINBOW PROSPECTS AHEfID.
NOT in the domain of material things only are
our prospects bright for the coming year. The
rain is not the only thing that has come down
upon us with showers of blessings. The brains of our
reformers, more saturated than the clouds and full of
fogs and mists, continue to pour out upon us an un
ceasing rain of promises and to overarch the land
with a glorious bow of political reform.
A few days ago at the close of a lecture on the
labor problem by Carroll D. Wright in a Massachu
setts city, one of the auditors rose and stated that
after the first day of next September he would answer
ar.y one in any city in the United States and show a
solution for the question of the unemployed that
would stand any test that could be imposed and could
be put into operation at a cost not greater than the
cost of the Civil War.
While it is to be regretted that this solution is not
to be made public at once, it is comforting to learn
that we may expect it before the next rainy season
sets in. It will be wearisome waiting for September,
but that time will come as it always comes and be
tween that date and Thanksgiving day there will be
ample time to so profit by the new philosophy as to
enable every man to have work, wages and a turkey
dinner with a champagne accompaniment at a cost
not greater than the Civil War. It is a lovely rain
bow: distant, but distinct: far off, but enticing.
Furthermore in the city of Wichita, Kans., there is j
a glow of brightness shining along the ragged edges j
of the thunderstorm. The Democrats of that city
have nominated for Mayor a certain James \V. Tapp
of the Salvation Army, and he is reported to have
promised if elected to carry out this programme:
''Ten dollars fine for any girl wearing bloomers on
the street. Any policeman heard swearing to be dis
charged and all will be required to carry Bibles. Re- |
ligious services to be held twice daily in the city
building. Free streetcar service to be given on Sun
day morning to all church-goers. Sunday theaters
and baseball games to be forbidden. Spitting on the
sidewalks to be a finable offense."
With such returns coming in from widery separated
commonwealths like Massachusetts and Kansas, and
with forty-three other States and several Territories
yet to be heard from, what further evidence can be
asked of coming prosperity? What brighter rainbows
could we wish for above the political horizon? Jt is
going to be all right with California. The rest of the
country is clearly yearning for prunes â and Cali
fornia will have a big crop.
DEFECTIVE LEGfJL LOGIC.
A CURIOUS development of the attempt to sup
press gambling at the- Ingleside racetrack is
the appearance on the scene of an attorney who
claims that the Police Department, in apprehending
criminals, possesses no authority to invade property
.inclosed by a fence or protected by any artificial bar
rier. Attorney Ach is not celebrated for his legal
learning nor distinguished for the depth with which
he penetrates legal problems, but in this matter he
has shown that he knows less about the law than ne
ces-sity, which is said tq kt w no law whatever.
It is true that a man's he se is his castle and that
he may within its walls do as he pleases, but this doc
trine is limited by the other and more important doc
trine that a man cdnnot do in his house what the law
forbids him to do elsewhere. It is true that no man
can enter forcibly another's house without warrant of
law. but to say that a police officer, who is authorized
by law to arrest upon the evidence of his own eyes,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1899.
cannot enter a house where a murder is being com
mitted or some one is being beaten into insensibility
is to lay down a doctrine which for absurdity is only
equalled by the injunction logic of Attorney Ach.
Besides, even if a man"s house were his castle to
commit murder in it if he pleases, the Ingleside race
track is neither a house nor a castle. It is an m
closure erected for the purpose of charging an ad
mission fee. If the racetrack gamblers did not want
to collect a dollar from every person who witnesses
their races they would have avoided the expense of
surrounding their grounds with a fence. There is no
resemblance between this fence, either in theory or in
actual contemplation of the law, and the walls of a
man's house.
The fact of the matter is, Attorney Ach's contention
is a legal absurdity, utterly unsupported by authority
oi reason. The police were informed that an ordi
nance of the Board of Supervisors was being vio
lated at the Ingleside racetrack. They thereupon pro
ceeded to the place, entered forcibly, and with their
own eyes saw the bookmakers scooping in the
ducats of the populace. If comparison is admitted at
all the case is similar to that of a peace disturber or
a murderer carrying on his operations inside the walls
of a house. When a crime is being committed the
police are authorized by law to overcome all barriers
between them and the criminal. Attorney Ach ought
to take a reef in his logic or abandon the law and
enter upon mercantile pursuits.
THE OREGON PRUNE TRADE.
OUR esteemed contemporary, the Oregonian,
in commenting upon the organization of the
Prune-Growers' Association in this State, not
only shows a clear appreciation of the importance of
the movement, but directs the attention of the prune
growers of Oregon to the advisability of co-operat
ing with it. The point made by the Oregonian is
that the interests of the industry in the two States
are identical. In illustration of the fact it says:
"The want of trade organization in Oregon, co
operative or other, is not only a serious matter for
our own own prune-growers, but for the growers of
California. During the past year prunes of the forty
to-fifty grade have been fairly waiting for from 7Y2
to 9 cents in growers' hands. Californians readily got
these figures, but the Oregonians accepted anything
offered them, and in the main the Oregon produce of
forty-to-fifty prunes was sold at prices ranging from
3V2 to 5 cents. Any careful regulation of the Cali
fornia market must involve protection against bad
methods of marketing in Oregon. In other words,
Califorina for her own protection must see to it that
Oregon has such opportunities in the markets as will
prevent the Oregon crop from being a demoralizing
factor in each marketing season."
The lesson taught in that statement is not needed
in California, for the prune-growers of this State are
well aware of the desirability of obtaining the co
operation of the growers in Oregon. In fact, the
movement started in San Jose expressly includes a
plan for such co-operation. The value of the argu
ment of the Oregonian is to be sought in the effect
it produces in its own State. It is safe to say that it
is well understood here that "California for her own
protection must see to it that Oregon has such op
portunities in the markets as will prevent the Oregon
crop from being a demoralizing factor in each
marketing season."
The object of the California association is not in
any way to antagonize the interests of the g-owers
of any locality, but to steady the trade and make it
more profitable for all concerned. Good reasons
exist for believing that the present depression in the
industry is due not so much to an oversupply as to
bad methods of marketing. It is said the fluctua
tions in the prices of prunes are so great as to render
the trade something like a speculation, and prudent
merchants hesitate to purchase large stocks. If in
any way the prices can be made more stable the
middlemen will be more willing to handle the goods
and as a consequence the consumption will increase.
In this, and indeed in all other issues, the States of
the Pacific Coast have a harmony of interest. There
ought to be cordial co-operation, and, as far as pos
sible, combination in all efforts for the improvement
of Pacific Coast industries. The Oregonian has been
always a stanch exponent of the truth in this respect,
and it is gratifying to note that it is giving its potent
aid in promoting co-operation in this specific case.
THE HONOR OF THE ARMY.
WHILE the brave soldiers of the republic are
dying under the tropic sun of the Philippines,
and men upon whom there is no stain and no
shadow of suspicion are giving lives for their coun
try, there are matters pertaining to the army at home
too grave in their import to be overlooked. The
honor of the army has always been dear to troopers
and to civilians. Now it has been endangered.
Lieutenant NeaH is about to be tried on a serious
charge.- He absented himself without leave, went
to a foreign country, as a swindler might go, and
having returned seems to expect that his offense will
be condoned. This is for a military court to decide.
Soon we shall know the estimate the army itself
places upon "honor."
There seems to be no denial of the allegation that
when Neall disappeared he took with him funds be
longing to his associates. That upon coming back
he made prompt restitution is certainly to his credit,
and yet even this does not seem to the observer suf
ficient to restore him to standing as an officer and a
gentleman.
To be plain. Neall disgraced the uniform he wore,
the cause he served; violated the tenets of society
and friendship and honesty. That he forgot his oath
and his years of discipline is also plain.
The plea is made for Neall that he is so good a sold
ier the service cannot spare him. This seems to
us a disparagement of the service. There is no one
man who cannot be spared. There is no officer into
whose authority another officer might not step and
fulfill every duty. Just why Neall should have been
singled out as the exception to the rule is far from
clear. He should feel gratified; he might even feel
flattered.
This subject does not concern alone the army. Our
soldiers are citizens before they are soldiers. They
represent the country. In large measure the whole
people will be judged by those among them ad
judged worthy to bear arms. The subject of a sol
dier's honor affects the honor of more than are in
the ranks.
However, a military tribunal is to decide. There
i? no desire to prejudice it. There can only be ex
pressed a hope that it may do its duty fairly and
well. In the meantime much embarrassment and
possibly some scandal could be averted were Neall to
resign. The service, despite an opinion to the con
trary, could spare him.
The appeal issued by the Government to the Fili
pinos is not believed to be of the caliber to impress
them.
If the next census fail to suit Chicago she will take
in a county or two more and order a new census.
RANCH AND RURAL LIFE
The very prolonged drought has finally been entirely broken, and the
soil has been deeply moistened by the March rain.
It is useful to think a little and talk some on the subjec t of tms PÂ«t
drought in California. It has been on for two years, the rainsol an y
and March this year being practically the only rains of an Vâ¢^drouÃht
twenty-four months. Of course that means a prolonged, P c J 81 | te â¢ " a B b '
and yet its effect upon the varied crops and industries of the State was 1
slight. The statistics in the annual report of President Chipman of the i btate
Board of Trade shows that in nearly all lines, and especially in .Â£uit ami
fruit products, the exports last year gained on 1897. There nas v
local distress. Places in the dairy districts have been dried out, ana cisc
where there has been loss of stock due to lack of feed.
But put all the losses of this long drought alongside the dro "f ni ; '"
Eastern States and compare the ability of California to endure with tnai
of the East. In the prairie States eight weeks in the proving season with
out rain means an entire loss of all crops. Two months at sucn seaso in viÂ«u iÂ«
overpasses the limit of endurance without moisture. Here two >ea .
drought by no means materially affected California with disaster. j.Â«.
should be kept in mind by our people and should be widely known amon 8
the people who may look this way for homes and occupation to sustain
them by rural industry related to the soil. .
It is now established that pitiful destruction has occurred by frost m me
orange orchards of Florida. Not only is the crop cut off. but the trees are
frozen down. These disasters have been so frequent in that region that it
is no longer considered a rival of California in citrus fruits.
The American Poultry Journal says that it has been thought whole oats
would not do for chicken feed. Experiments, however, prove this to be
unfounded. Oats are good bone-making feed and are now fed whole with
fine results. Whole barley is highly recommended as a chicken ration, it
should be put in a tight vessel and covered with boiling water, the vessel
being covered to retain the steam. This softens it and it is drained in a
sieve and fed. Bran is good food for producing eggs, the best of all ground
feed.
In Brazil blows a wind like our north wind in California, only worse,
and is there called the '-suicide wind." It disposes men to self destruction
and suicides are frequent while it blows.
Luxuriant growth in fruit trees is not often associated with fine bear
ing. Very thrifty trees are cured of barrenness by pruning the roots. A
trench is dug around the tree at a proper distance to cut off the ends or
the roots, and the dirt taken out is then thrown back. Pear trees often re
quire this treatment.
The foothill orchards are set for a large crop of fruit this year. Orch
ardists should firmly enforce thinning of the fruit. The great drain on the
vitality of a tree is not in perfecting the pulp of such fruits as the peach,
apricot, nectarine, plum and prune, but in perfecting and maturing the seed,
the pit, both shell and kernel. When by thinning the weight of pulp can
be increased, the size and marketable value of the fruit made better and
at the same time the strength of the tree saved by lessening the number
of the pits to be ripened, the saving and profit are worth considering. A
worthless peach, that has ripened its seed, exhausts the tree just as much
as a first-class one.
Bees are reliable weather forecasters. If a storm is coming they will not
leave the hive to work, no matter how fine the morning may be. If a storm
approaches after they are out they hurry home from the blooms as fast as
their wines can carry them.
The hotel child who clatters through the hall
And shouts a weary shout of empty glee,
Until some guest sends down an angered call.
And bellboys tell him he must stop it allâ
Oh, what a life this life of his must be!
He goes to shows, but no tramp dog is his.
To play with him in shed or field or wood.
He looks from windows, sees the white steam fiz:
A forestry of blackened smokestacks is
The sum and substance of his "neighborhood."
His wealthy father buys him pretty clothes;
His mother garbs him out all trig and trim;
But, in all glory decked, do you suppose
That hungry-hearted little magnate knows
One-half the blessings that accrue to him?
He looks sometimes from out his window high
Across the intervening roof and sees
The watchman's child, who shouts a greeting cry
To come young neighbor of a loft near by-
He wishes well he might be one of these.
With uncombed hair and patches at his knees.
The hotel child, unloved but by his own.
Has plays and toys. The watchman's boy has none.
But of all dreams the rich man's heir has known,
The fondest is to be the watchman's son.

STATE NOTES.
Bobwhite quails, just received from the East, have been liberated in
Fresno County.
The drought discovered many resources before unknown. Mr. Strath
earne, in Ventura County, had to carry eight hundred head of cattle through
the dry time and did it by feeding them the prickly pear cactus. The plant
was placed in piles with brush and set on fire to burn the thorns off. The
cattle did well f-eding- on the pulpy leaves. The burning being a troublesome
affair the plant was finally fed chopped up fine, thorns and all, and the
cattle ate it with no inconvenience from the thorns. Milch cows especially
did well on cactus. We may ?onn expect the appearance in the market of
the cactus brand of beef and butter.
The abundant manzanita bloom will help out the California honey crop.
It is one of the best honey blooms we have and the quality of its honey is
equal to white sage.
Mr. Thompson of Lanark Park. Stanislaus County, has a double cutter
that cuts straw and alfalfa together, an inch long, and in that way his
stock eats the alfalfa clean, which is seldom the case when it is fed with
out cutting. He found that mixing in straw made it so good a horse feed
that his stock did all tho plowing and seeding without barley, at a saving
of 5150.
Five acres of sweet potatoes will fatten more hogs than twenty-five
acres of corn. Turning sweet potatoes into pork ought to be profitable here,
where they grow abundantly.
VALIDITY OF Th|E
STRATTON ACT
I learn from one of the attorneys rep
resenting the Non-Partisan party that
the new primary election law is to be
assailed for unconstitutionally; nor am
I surprised to learn that the point of
| attack is to be its lack of uniformity,
i or that the previsions of section 1370
constitute special legislation.
The origin of the act recently ap
proved by the Governor is of no con
sequence except to set in a better light
the conduct of certain Senators with
reference to the feature of the bill to
â be assailed. The feature forming the
point of attack was inserted in the bill
; by amendment and it is proper that an
j explanation be made and the responsi
j bllity placed where it belongs.
For one reason or another all at
i tempts prior to the act of 1599 have
! failed to pass the scrutiny of the courts
on constitutional grounds.
The act of 1897, known as the Strat
ton bill, introduced by Senator Strat
ton, was the worst of all. No less than
fifteen fatal objections were raised
against it in the Supreme Court, one of
them being its lack of uniformity and
total omission of means or methods of
enforcement.
The power to frame any constitution
al act was, immediately after that de
cision, challenged by lawyers and' poli
ticians of high and low degree. The
challenge was accepted by the inter
party conference, the origin of which
is immaterial. It organized and ap
pointed a committee of lawyers to draft
an act which should meet the constitu
tional objections pointed out by the
court in passing upon the Stratton act
of 1897. (Spier vs. Baker, 120 Cal. Re
ports.) Tin committee's work was
completed in December. IS9S, and its
report adopted by the conference at a
meeting held at the rooms of the Union
League Club of San Francisco. This
committee had representatives at both
the Republican and Democratic State
Conventions in 1898 and secured an ap
proval of its plan in both platforms.
At his request Senator Stratton was al
lowed to introduce the bill (Senate bill
30). A committee was appointed to
promote the passage of the bill and re
sist prejudicial amendments.
A member of this committee was in
fluential in procuring the rejection of
all amendments which were not im
provements in phraseology with the ex
ception of one offered by Senator Gil
lette on the floor of the Senate and ig
norantly indorsed by Senator Stratton,
who had charge of the bill. With keen
est regret I must admit that the
amendment renders doubtful the con-,
stitutionality of the entire act. The
subsequent efforts to have It eliminated
by amendment deserve more than a
passing notice. The amendment was
inserted in section 1370 (Code number)
and reads as follows: .
"Where a State convention is to be
held the respective petitions as filed
shall provide that the same delegates
composing - the State convention, who
reside within the j respective 'railroad
commissioner districts and State equal
THE HOTEL, CHILD.
ization districts, shall be the delegates
to the respective conventions to nom
inate candidates for Railroad Commis
sioners and for members of the State
Board of Equalization. And the peti
tions filed by Congressional District
Committees, where there are such com
mittees, shall state whether the dele
gates elected to a State convention,
; within such Congressional District.
shall be the delegates empowered to
! nominate a candidate for Congress in
such district, or whether separate dele
gates shall bo selected in such Congres
sional District for that purpose. And
petitiens filed by Senatorial or Assem
; bly district committees, from districts
! including more than one county, where
! there are such distriefcommittees. shall
i state whether the same delegates to tho
! State Convention residing within such
! district shall nominate the candidate
: for Senator or Assemblyman in such
| district, or whether separate delegates
' shall be elected in such district forthat
I purpose. And unless there shall be
| such district petitions providing for
: such separate delegates in the cases
aforesaid, such district candidates for
Congress. State Senator or Assembly
man shall be nominated by the dele
gates to the State Convention who
come from and reside within such re
j spective districts."
It will be seen that an impotent at
tempt is here made to provide for nom
inations to be made by delegates to a
convention representing: an entirely dif
ferent party than that for which the
nominee is to become the candidate all
of which and the effect of which is
clearly seen by comparison with pre
ceding parts of the same act and sec
tion 11S6 of the Political Code as
amended by Senate bill No. 95 at the
same session and taking effect subs*
quently to the primary act. By Â«Aid
section 1186. as amended, a lawful con
vention must be composed of delesratP*
elected by ballot at a primary election
and representing the party of the po
litical division which polled 3 per cent
of the entire vote of the particular po
litical division The primary act con
tains no provision by which narri"Â«
within political divisions which hVve
no governing committees can narthi
pate in a primary election or hold a
1066 and 13.0 of the act as well as said
section 118b negative the power of any
other assemblage of delegates to do Â«s - O
-and said power is still mor* clearly
negatived in section 1567, where the
various conventions and their powers
are defined and limited. The portions
of section 13(0 preceding the above quo
tation recognize the existence and
right of subdivisional parties which
have no committees, to participate in
the primary to have conventions of
their own and should have provided a
method for such participation, but hav
ing provided no method by which they
can participate the act may with con
siderable force of argument be de
nounced by the Non-Partisans as spe
cial legislation, partial and discrimin
ating in application. By amendments
to section 11S8 of the Political Code
made at the same session, such parties
are deprived of any right to go on the
ballot by petition. Senator Stratton
while admitting these points when
pointed out to him in time to have
amended Senate bill SO, expressed con
fidence that the primary act would be
sustained by the courts on account of
its "general equltableness," which the
legal profession will recognize as a new
element in political law, and will also
remember that the learned Senator un
dertook to reply to the objections to
the "Stratton primary law" with
the same kind of plea and bitterly de
nounced the court for its decision ad
verse to his plea.
Those who had so carefully framed
Senate bill No. 30 urged him to amend
that bill, as to the defects above point,
ed out, before it was finally passed,
failing in which Assembly bill No. 40l
was introduced in the Assembly. The
Committee on Election Laws of the
Assembly, to whom Assembly bill No.
451 was referred, found some objections
to its phraseology and reported a sub
stitute (Assembly bill No. 636). Strat
ton, by representations to members of
the Democratic State Central Commit
tee, caused them to interfere and they
procured the enacting clause to be
stricken out of the substitute. The
necessity of a bill curative of the pri
mary act was again made apparent to
i the Assembly Committee on Election
Laws and that committee introduced
a committee bill (Assembly bill No.
911) from which all possible objections
were eliminated. On final passage in
the Assembly every objection was an
swered and it passed without a dissent
ing vote When it reached the Senate
it was referred to Stratton's com:,
which in due time recommended
passage. On third reading S<
Stratton and others made argunv
favor of its necessity and merits
Braunhart, without assigning a. si
objection, opposed it. On Thurs
March 9, it passed by 26 to 4, and
transmitted to the Assembly for â 
rollment. On the same evening
ton on a pretense of a desire to off.?:
amendments had it recalled and the
vote whereby it passed reconsidered.
But although it remained on the fik
until March 19 and was twice passed
on file he never offered a single amend
ment; and in the small hours of Sun
day morning. March 19, the bill, having
been, through the courtesy of a Senator
other than Stratton. called up for pap
sage, Stratton rose in his seat and said
it was a bad bill and should be de
feated, being unable to point out to the
tired and sleepy Senate any reason
why it was a bad bill. But eight Sena
tors, notwithstanding their drowsiness,
still remembering the logical arguments
of Senators Smith and Davis on its for
mer passage, voted for it. It was lost,
there being present a bare quorum.
The real cause of Stratton's change of
heart was that he preferred the favor
of designing and selfish politicians, and
rather than fail to gain it was willing
to imperil a measure of the greatest
importance to the political welfare of
the State.
The foregoing is written and pub
lished in order that the public may
know in advance of a successful attack
upon the act by the Non-Partisan
party, who is responsible for its failure.
I sincerely hope, as all must who de
sire good government, that the above
points which the Non-Partisans intend
to urtre before the courts may be an
swered, and the act sustained on ac
count of "general equitableness," or on
even more logical grounds, despite the
shortcomings of bungling legislators.

OREGON SHOET LINE.
It Will Soon Be Absorbed by the
Union Pacific.
W. A. Bancroft, general manager of the
Oregon Short Line, running from Hunt
ington to Ogden, is at the Occidental.
Mr. Bancroft says that his visit to this
coast has no special significance. When
seen yesterday he said briefly:
"The published dispatches to the effect
that 75 per cent of the stockholders of
the Oregon Short Line. had agreed to ex
change their stock for stock in the I nion
Pacific Company are substantially cor
rect and the transfers will undoubtedly
soon be made. In this way the Union Pa
ciflc will own a controlling interest In the
absorbed road, but the latter will be oper
ated under a separate management which
w4ll be practically the same at at present
constituted.
"The Utah and Pacific road is now
building an extension to its road fi r^
Milford in Utah in a southwesterly direc
tion to a point in Nevada. From there a
branch line will be built to Pioche. Th>;
line will be operated by the Utah and Pa
cific p.-ople, but they will have a traffic
exchange agreement with the Oregon
Short Line at Milford. "

A committee of schoolteachers met with

yesterday morning and took such action
as will probably result in the institution
of suits agair.pt the members of the old
Board of Education and ex-Auditor Brod
erick for I cry of an aggregate
sum of $242,310. This sum represents the
amount of Indebtedness incurred by the
old Board of Education over and above
the amount of money available in the

The meeting yesterday was held for the
purpose of vis-cussing the situation and
ascertaining, so far as possible, the exact
status of the salary claims held by teach
ers bo that their future acts may be In
telligently directed. While no formal
action was taken, it was agreed that the
teachers will not accept the compromise
recently offered by the merchants, and
they will withdraw* the suit;- now p<

and either trust to the generosity of the

The total outstanding indebtedness in
curred by the old board is $277,980. To
meet this demand there remains in the
treasury but $35,670. Auditor Wells stated
that he v. not audit any demands

Howard-street Methodist Episcopal
Church to interest themselves In the work
of securing the international convention
of that order for the city of San Fran-
Cisco in I9QL H. A. Xeedham acted as
chairman.
There was a prolonged discussion on the
subject, owing to the fact that Los An
geles and Seattle had been putting fortn
every effort for the past year to secure
the convention, and it was stated by some
that they had received encouraging prom
ls< a of support from high sources. An
other fact which prevented the sentiment
of the meeting from being unanimous on
the subject was that the selection will be
made by the national body within three
months and little time is available.
Among thosr- active in the discussion
were Rev. Mr. Woodward, Rev. Mr.
Board. Rolla V. Watt. C. B. Perkins, I.

RAILROAD MAGNATES
ON THEIR WAY WEST
SOUTHERN PACIFIC ELECTION
IS PENDING.
George Crocker Speaks of the Bright
Outlook for California
Crops.
In view of the approaching annual meet
ins of the stockholders of the Southern
Pacific Company, which is to be held in
this city on the sth of April, there is a :
gathering of the high officials of that cor
poration in progress. At this meeting the \
directors for the ensuing year will be â 
elected.
George Crocker, second vice-president !
of the Southern Pacific Company, accom
panied by Baron Randolph Xatili, a
Frenchman of noble birth, and Edwin ;
Hawley, general traffic manager of the j
Southern Pacific at New York, arrived j
here Sunday. Baron Xatili came to Cali
fornia as the guest of Mr. Crocker and |
expects to return East next week in com. j
pany with Mr. Hawley. The party came
by way of New Orleans, the journey
thence being made by daylight, to as to j
permit of an inspection of the road. Side
tripe were made to Guaymas, Sonora, and j
Globe, Ariz.
Mr. Crocker's trip East was undertaken j
to be present at the meeting which effect- I
ed the transfer of the Central Pacific !
Railroad to the Southern Pacific Com- j
pany. At the meetings held in New York
it was also decided, "as Mr. Crocker stated
yesterday, to rush the completion of work |
on the coast division line, particularly the j
closing of the gap between Surf and El
wood, and to construct, a branch from
Surf to Lompoc.
When Mr. Crocker was asked regarding
the report published to the effect that T. j
S. Stillman. one of the representatives of j
the Searles estate, was to be replaced by |
Horace G. Platt, he declared that fo far i
as he knew no such change was conteni
plated. He added that Mr. Stillman would \
not be present at the meeting of the I
stockholders, but that General Thomas j
H. Hubhard. the other representative of j
the Searles holdings, would be. and that i
It was not customary for both representa- j
tives to come out here together. Accord
ing to a telegram received yesterday from j
General Hubbard. that gentleman will ar- i
rive here on Monday next. President j
Huntlngton left New Orleans Sunday and ,
is due in this city in about a week.
Speaking of his trip through California.
Mr. Crocker said that the country was j
looking fine, especially through the Ban j
Joaquin Valley. "California will have a'
crop," he said, "such as she has never ;
had before, provided there is some more
rain about the middle of April."
Elected New Officers.
Owing to the fact that the member? of
ifetbodist Ministers' T'nion at-
a Moody meeting yesterday morninsr. no
paper was read at th* meeting. Instead,
the following officers were elected for the
ensuing term: W. N. Woodward, presi
dent; D. N. Hill, vi â¢ nt; F. N.
Woodward, secretary; programm*
mitteeâ Rev. H. E. Needham, Rev. F. C.
Hill and Rev. E. 11. Brown.

MAIDEN CLASS.

The racing 1 at Oakland yesterday was j
replete with surprises. Some hard-shelled
choices were entrusted Into Starter Fer
guson's hands and possessed of little or i
no class, but two of them reached the
wire first The winning- horses were:
Juva, 5 to 1; Glengaber, 5 to 2; Bathos, 9 j
to 5; Horton, 9 to 10; Cromwell, even, and
Highland Ball, 15 to 1.
The track dried out wonderfully fast,
and is now In fair condition. Jones piloted
two of the winners.
Hugh Jones' big sprinter. Mainstay, was
; a red-hot favorite for the oopening ftve
' furlong sprint, and could not raise a gal
lop. Juva, at odds of 6to 1, led from the
jump, winning easily from Frohman.

stretch, and then won at leisure. Master
Lee, the favorite, finished third, six
lengths behind Pallucas.
The Corrigan entry, Basseda. with
Thorpe in the saddle, "had first call in the
betting in the two-year-old dash, with a
fit-Id of eleven lining up at the barrier.
The filly showed a world of speed, but
met with poor racing luck, and was led
cut half a length by the second choice.
Bathos, piloted by Joe Piggott.
"Daggle" Smith's colt. Hcrton, looked
much the best of the starters in the Blx

A DESPERATE
BUTTLE WITH
A STINGAREE
Thrilling Experience
of a Fisher Boy.
BOAT WAS NEARLY CAPSIZED
THE FIGHTING FISH DRIVEN
OFF WITH AN OAR.
The Boy Became Entangled in the
Line and Was Towed a Long
Distance Before He Was
Rescued.
Audley Harris, a 15-year-old lad, who
lives with his parents at 2116 Clement aye
! nue, Alameda, had a desperate battle
yesterday with a stingaree while fishing
from a skiff near the Bay Farm Island
bridge.
Stingarees hover in great numbers near
the old oyster beds in San Leandro Bay,
but as a rule they have shown little fight
and have never been dreaded by the
youthful fishermen who find lots or sport
in the vicinity of the old bridge.
Young Harris had been fishing for
perch and had made a very eatistactoo
catch, when he felt a tug on his line that
made him think he had caught a whale.
With considerable difficulty he hauled in
his line. There was a great commotion
' in the water, followed by the appearance
! of a great flesh-colored object, with hns
like the wings of a bird and a long spear
' shaped tall. The fish made directly for
Hairi*' boat. It churned up the waves
! near the little craft and struck at it
viciously with its long dartlike sting.
: Hairis was badly frightened, but when
i the stingaree seemed to make a desperate
effort to overturn the boat or get aboard
tlv- young man pulled himself together
and struck at it with an oar. His aim was
poor and his weapon went adrift. Grasp
ing the otht-r oar he renewed the battle
and succeeded in driving off the ferocious
fish, but his remaining oar went with it.
In the encounter he became entangled in
i the fish line, and as the stingaree rapidly
I swam away he felt the cord tighten about
hi? body. His desperate efforts to disen
i tangle himself only resulted in him get
i ting more firmly tied up, when he gave
lup in despair. His boat was being rap-
Idly drawn through the water out into
! the bay, and the young man had almost
! given up hope of ever seeing friends and
home asrain when some men on shore no
ticed his predicament and went to his as
i sistance in a rowboat. After a chase of
j over a mile, when the stingaree. appa
! rently tired and slackened its speed, they
caught up with Harris' craft and aspi?tf<l
! him in landing his big catch. The stinga
! ree weighed over 200 pounds.
Death Was Accidental.
The man supposed to be Rudolph How
ard, who was taken from an alley in Chi
natown Sunday with a fractured skull,
died in the Harbor Hospital yesterday
morning. The police are satisfied that
death was due to an accident and was not
the result of foul play. Officer C. Peters.
who reported the case, paid he saw the
man enter Bartlett alley very much under
the Influence of liquor. He started up
stairs into a house near the corner of
Pacific street and soon afterward plunged
back, head foremost. Into the street, his
head striking on a stone doorstep. There
was no sign of blood on the stairs, as
would in all probability have been the
case had the man been struck with a
hammer while going up the stairs.

LIFE or
DEATH.
A noted educator and philosopher once said:
"Health and disease ar.e conditions on which
depend pleasure or sorrow, happiness or un-
happinesa, success or failure. Health makes
a man equal to any emergency. Disease makes
htm unequal to the ordinary duties of life. It
is economy to be well."

OREGON PRUNES SHORT.
The reports from Henry E. Dosch. Horticul
tural Commissioner of the First District, shows
that much damage has been done to prune
trres by the severe weather of the past winter.
Mr. Doseh pays that the condition is much
more disheartening than he had expected to
find it. All the Italian prune trees, ranging in
age from one to twelve years, planted on low
bottom lands, are sufficiently injured to cause
their licath, the ampium being black in all
trees a'.,d the bark loose on many. None of
these trees, he says, shows any outward sign of
injury They will' leaf out and even bloom,
but by June "will begin to wither and die.
Tf'e Italian prune orchards planted on the
hills especially those sloping to the north and
northwest, are perfectly sound, are Just begin
ning to quicken and possibly will have from
B0 to 60 per cent of fruit, while on the other
hand the French prune orchards on these hill
lands particularly those ping to the south
and soutljwest, are all dead, notably the well
known Cottle orchards, consisting of some forty
acres of French prunes. â¢
â¢'This may seem strange." said Mr. Dosch.
"as the French prune trees are considered
hnrdur than the Italian, and so they are, but I
will explain this paradoxical situation by say
ing that Juiiclng from the bud development
of these French prune trees, they quickened too
Foon under the influence of the warm January
weather, and were full of sap when the freeze
cime: hence their death. This also applies to.
thÂ» Italians on the warm bottom lands.
â¢The apple trees are still dormant, and show
no injury whatever, while the Bartlett pears
show some injury on the southwest side, and
will not have more than a quarter crop.

nearly one and one-quarter million shares. Ag
gressive hull manipulation by the leaders of

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 27.â Previous serious crop
damage reports were supplemented before the
opening by scores of similar communications.
As a result there was a sharp up turn in
wheat right at the start. May began %c high
er, with buyers at from 71% c to 71% c. The
market kept on the jump until it reached 72V*c
Liverpood was %d up to start with, and the
next quotation from there added another %d
to the earlier advance. The weather was un
seasonably cold, and in the Northwest, where
much less than the usual amount of fall plow
ing in preparation for spring seeding had been
done, the prevailing temperatures were close
around, the zero mark. Besides the damage to
wheat in the Southwest, very bad news was
i received from sections of Illinois and Indiana,
previously reporting excellent prospects. Heavy
I Northwest receipts had a modifying effect on
the bull feeling for a while, but this was finally
dissipated by the evidences coming to hand of
crop damages. The fluctuations after the first
advance to 72% c for May were numerous. It
reacted to "Hie, rose to 72% c, dropped again
to 71% c and once more advanced to 72% c, with
closing trades at the last named quotation.
The hears made July the principal object of
attack. It held up well notwithstanding and
closed at 71% c. a gain of l%c for the day.
Light receipts, small country offerings and
higher cables strengthened corn. The demand
from the seaboard for cash corn was much bet
ter than for some time. May opened %@>4c j
; higher and closed %c higher. â ',"â ., '!
1 Buying by shorts on account of delayed seed
, i ing caused an advance in oats. May closed Me
higher.
Buying by packers and short covering on ac
count of the strength In grains helped provis
' ions May pork closed 5c higher; May lard and
ribs each 2%@5c higher.

THE STOCK MARKET.
On the mornlner session of th<Â» Bond Bxchaaga
the sugar stocks ted in activity and were steady
to firm, there being no loss in value. The
other docks were quiet and featureless.
Mining stocks shewed no particular change
and were quiet. The old fire in the Consoli
dated California and Virginia mmÂ« was report
ed extinguished, as will be spf.-n below.
For the week ending March 24 the minrs of
Eureka and neighboring districts in Nevada
shipped the following amounts of ore by rail:
Diamond mine, 142.470 pound*; Eureka Consoli
dated, 79, 950 pounds; Jackson, 33,890 pounds;
Richmond, 38.710 pounds.
The Giant Powder Company has declared its
fourth monthly dividend of 50c per share, paya
blt on the lOtb of April.
The Jamison mine, in Plumas County, will
pay a dividend of 511,700 on April 15. This is
the third dividend In eighteen months, and Is
at the rate of 3c per share.
The official report from the Consolidated Cal
ifornia and Virginia mine states that the Com
etock Pumping Association was engaged in the
following work at the C. and C. shaft during
the past week. 1400-foot levelâ Ail of thÂ«
I heavy and dangerous ground at the point of in
tersection with the northwest and southwest
I drifts has been carefully retimbered and Is now
1 quite safe. The drift to connect with the old
stopes has been started and Is now at a point
409 feet west of the C. and C. shaft 1400-foot
station. This drift will be run a little south
of west for 300 feet and is Intended to connect
with crosscut No. 2, that was started 15 feet
south of the old Consolidated Virginia shaft
and run 300 feet about due east. 1650 levelâNo
work has ' been done on this level
during the week. 1750 ' level â bulk
head that was placed in this drift 400
feet west of the shaft was removed and the
drift carefully examined. The water that was
turned in from the 1650 level in the neighbor-
I hood of the last fire was found to have thor
! oughly drenched and flooded this level. Several
tons of fine rock, timber and charcoal were
washed down from the old stopes and deposited
on this level. The drift has been cleaned out,
repaired and track laid Into the first winze
that connects with the ISOO and 1850 stopes.
This winze is at a point Just south of the
northwest drift and in from the C. and C. shaft
712 feet. The winze station was partially re
paired before the fire. The repairs will be
completed and the old compressor and air hoist
formerly used at this point will be repaired and
i put in position for the required work in the
winze.
In the old Central - tunnel workings of the
Ophlr mine during the past week crosscut No.
1 was extended six feet: total length, twenty
feet, but nothing of value was found. Cross
cut No. 2. started at a point 180 feet northwest
of the main. west, dritt. or fifty-four feet from
the first â  -osscut. is now in eight feet. The
crosscut was started in solid quartz; the face
Is now in quartz, clay and porphyry. The
wes>t drift that was connected with the north
west vein has been cleaned out and repaired
fifty-seven feet; total length, eighty-three feet.
This is the drift that Is Intended for an airway.
Work has been continued on the Sutro tunnel
connection, and the drift extended eight feet;
total length, thirty-nine feet;, face in hard
porphyry.
In the Hale and Norcross mine the work
of cleaning out and repairing the connecting
drift between the main Incline and the Sutro
i tunnel south lateral - branch Is progressing
I favorably.
In the Sierra Nevada mine the north drift
started at a point 457 feet northwest from the
140-foot level station of the shaft was ad
vanced ten feet during the week: total length,
243 feet; face In quartz which assays $1 60 to
$2 50 per ton. At a point 223 feet north from
the west drift have started a raise to con
nect with the Rlley tunnel and have advanced
the same sixteen feet. Said raise when com
' pleted will give ventilation for exploring the
1 ground IGO feet vertically under the Rlley tun
nel. " On the 900-foot level of the Union shaft
workings of the Sierra Nevada, the south drift
from the top of the raise, eighty feet above
this level was advanced ten feet during the
week; total, 122 feet; face In porphyry.
In the Best and Belcher and Gould and
Curry mines work on the connection between
the Sutro tunnel branch and the Osblston
shaft was continued during the week and
enough debris removed to enable them to start
the work of retimberlng the station. Part of
the station sets are Intact, so that but four
sets will be required to repair the station and
put it in first-class condition.

THE FRUITS
OF HER SIN
Sad Story of a Run
away Wife.
HER LOVE TURNED TO HATE
ALFRED NICKELLS, HORSE
TRAINER, IN COURT.
Charged With Threatening to Kill
His Wife. Nora. Who Has
Sued Him for Ali
mony.
Alfred Kickells, horse-trainer for Prince
Poniatowski, appeared before acting Po
lice Judge Barry yesterday on a charge
of threats against life preferred by his
wife, Nora, who lives at 315 Faxton ave
nue, Ingleside.
The threats were alleged to have taken
place on March 12.
â¢ When- the case was called it was dis
covered that no complaint was on tile.
Attorney Frank Drury, who represented
Mrs;. Xickells, stated that he had made
one out and the Judge said he Remem
bered signing it. Attorney Drury suggest
ed, that the "pull" had got in its work
and the Judge continued the case for a
few minutes till a new complaint was
sworn- to.
Mrs. Nickells testified that on March 12 I
her husband came home and asked for
the key of his bedroom. She was busy at j
the time and told him to wait. Finally |
she gave him the key and as he was j
walking- through the dining-room she re
marked, "You had better make yourself
look pretty," and ho rushed at her and
said he would do her up now. She rushed I
out of tire house to save herself. Nickells |
denied threatening to kill her and said he
was angry because his meal was not
ready. The Judge dismissed the case on
â  NickeHs 1 promise that he would keep
away from his wife in future.
An attempt was made to introduce other ;
â¢ evidence of threats and Mrs. Nickells had |
Martin Mullen, a boy, to corroborate her
testimony, but the Judge declined to al
low the evidence to be heard, much to
Mrs. Nickells' disappointment.
Mrs. Nickells, through her attorney,
Frank i rury. instituted suit in the Su
perior Court yesterday gainst her hus
band for alimony, and when the case is
tried some interesting disclosures will be
made, as she is determined to expose her
.husband for all he has made her suffer.
"He has treated me brutally for years,"
she said yesterday, "and on February 5,
In the presence of the boy. Martin Mul
len, and his daughter he seized a carving
krvife and rushing at me called me vile
names ar.d said he -would cut out my
heart and walk on it. His daughter
pulled him back and told him not to kill
me, as the boy would be a witness. Then
he sat down and cried and made another
rush at- me, tearing out my hair. For
two weeks after that he compelled me to
sleep on a hard sofa with a rug for a
covering. Then he apologized, and, wife
like, I forgave him.
â¢'I met Nickella in my husband's hotel,
Burke and Russell streets, Melbourne,
Australia, twelve years ago. My hus
band's name was Willmore. Nickella
then represented himself as a single man,
although I afterward found out that he
had deserted a wife and three young
children in England. I â¢ [oped with him
nine years ago. taking- with me $40,000 and
about $1000 worth of jewelry. We came to
-this country and lived together- as man
ar.-l wife. Nickells purchased racehorses
with my money ar.d squandered it all.
"Four" years ago he learned that his
wife had died in England and I asked
him to do right by me, as my. husband
rhad died a year after I deserted him, and I
w.e were jrinrripd in Oakland. Recently ',
r.nc of his daughters came from England i
and"* since then my life, has been a tor- j
jnent. He has never since I knew him i
'contributed one cent toward my support, ;
. nr.d has arot money recently â¢ rom me on j
the pretext of buying horses. I have laid
claim to the ' directors of the racetrack
to a half interest in the two horses Ma
mie Scott and The <~'al}fornian and will
assert my rights, as my money helped to
purchase them."
Death of H. W. Davis.
H. W. Davis, deputy constable of San
Pablo, died suddenly in the Winchester
â¢_ ion Third street, last night Mr.
Davis registered in the hotel about a
week a*?o and has often complained of
being in bad health. T.ast night at about

; : â¢ VALUE OF CREAM.
â  : As Compared With Meat.
One. of the most valuable items in
one's dietary is good, rich cream.* The
remark is frequently made that "cream
is too expensive- to use. freely." Some
â¢people think they must have meat
every day at 10 and 26 cents per pound
and do not realize that 5 cents worth of
pure cream for breakfast will do more
to put on flesh than 25 or 30 cents worth
of meat*
An ideal. portion of breakfast is that
obtained from Bay, four teaspoons of
JGra'pe-Nuts and a little, pure, thick
cream;- either-cold or hot.
This- is one of the most delicious
-dishes â " fmaginable and is served
without "cooking or trouble of any kind
apd c.annbt be equaled in point of food
v.-due for the human body.

. The Grape-Nuts, consisting largely
"of 'grape sugar, have passed through
â¢pro! esses similar to the first act of di-
ge'stiori and are therefore most easily
digested, and in combination with
cream, .they render the cream itself
easy f -digestion.

A SAWED-OFF
MELODRAMA AT
THE ORPHEUM

From Russia.
MELBA WINS LOS ANGELES
INCENDIARY MELODRAMA FOR
ALHAMBRA PATRONS.
"The Bohemian Girl" Once More at
The Tivoliâ Held-Over Bills
at the Other The
aters.
By Ashton Stevens.
There Is a sawed-off melodrama in
cluded in the Orpheum bill this week
that, while not remarkable in itself, is
at least suggestive of a new scheme In
the short pieces that have become so
popular in the vaudeville houses. This
latest effort is named ''The Counsel for
the Defense," and Is presented by Mr.
and Mrs. William Robyns. It is pecu
liar in that the usual deeds of heroism
and crime do not take place on the
stage; they are told in narrative or else
merely inferred.
An agf-d lawyer who tries to conceal
his softheartedness by means of a gruff
manner, a flowing dressing gown and
a diamond shirtwarmer, ia visited at
his apartments by a young woman
from th.' Bowery. S ne begs him to de
fend the life of her lover, who has been
arrested under suspicious circum
stances and charged with a murder
that is the sensation of the hour. The
lawyer hus read his newspapers and
seems to know all about the case. "I
don't want it," he says. "The fellow
!.- no earthly chance; but I suppose
he has made you believe in his inno
cence."
"Naw; he hasn't said much about it,"
sobs Mollie. "I took de word of him as
done de murder."
"And who was that?"
"Me fadder!"
Then Mollie explains that her parent
is not quite tranquil in his mindâ
"nutty" Js the way she diagnoses it in
her gentle dialectâ that her â¢'steady"
can prove ah alibi; that he was far
away in Brooklyn in company with a
sailor on the fateful night of the crime.
"And the sailor," says the now ex
cited lawyer; "he's your only hope
where is he?"
"Me Gawd," Mollie moans, "he put to
sea this mornin'."
After a little agitated by-play the at
torney discovers his telephone, rings up
the signal station at Sandy Hook, to
find that the vessel in which the needed
witness embarked had sailed three
hours ago. More consternation and de
spair from Mollie, until the lawyer is
reminded of Fire Island, and telephones
to the station there to stop the vessel
by flashlight signal and say that a tug
will set out at once to bring back the
sailor. The tug will cost $100. Mollie
has come fresh from the pawnbroker's
with a depleted wardrobe and the
proud sum of $9 47. But by this time
the lawyer's heart has overcome all
professional scruples, and with genial
profanity and sundry eyewipes he
guarantees all the expense. Mollie
Godblesses him in emotional slang, and
the curtain comes down with the infer
ence that all will end well.
Now, this one is not better than most
melodramas, but it is shorter and
serves to show what could be done on
Bimilar lines by an expert dramatist
and first-rate players. Remove the
blood and thunder, leave nothing but
the sentimental Interest, a touch of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALT,, TUESDAY, MARCH 28, 1809.
humorous character and the feeling of
suspense, and the best of us could en
joy a thirty-minute dose of melodrama.
The subject invites the attention of all
enterprising vaudeville playwriters.
Th>> rest of the show is "variety"
I purr* and simple, with the large bou
! quet for the Matweef troupe of tum
blers, singers and dancers. They are
Russians; six in number, four males,
one female and one person in female
; attire; and they present an act that
is one steady round of nimbleness and
'. excitement. The men are startling
' dancers, doing a "sitting-down" move
! ment much like that of the two Rus
sian girls who were so successful in
the Orpheum some weeks back, and one
breaking all records for spinning him
self top-fashion. The tumbling is
even as remarkable as the dancing.
Three stand in a tower and fall, not as
it usually is done, but backwards, turn
ing about only when a few inches from
the floor. The Matweefs offer one of
th<= most diverting performances ever
| housed in the Orpheum and are ud for
I a big hit.
Another graceful turn is contributed
by the two Dartos, who give Frenchy
variations to the polite dances of the
day. Manning and Weston <a man and
â 1 do a skit that is remarkable for
the boy's singing of popular ballads.
Master Weston has a natural boyish
voiceâ natural even to springing from
the nose half the timeâ and makes
quite an impression. By being a llttl"
] PSS self-conscious he would make a
still bigger one. The children of vau
deville seem to be simply senile in self
adulation.
The Pantzer brothers do feats In
head-to-head balancing that are even
more dangerous than those of their
former visit; the rest of the bill is from
last week.
Melba in Los Angeles.
The opera-house In Los Angeles was
crowded to the doors last night to heai
M( Ibaand the Ellis company In "Faust."
Melba had driven through the town and
surrounding country during the day and
her voice was in the pink of form. In thr
j garden and prison scenes she received
tremendous ovations. Bonnard, says the
telegram, was in better shape than when
!n San Francisco. He sang the Faust that
was denied us on account of his iilnes:
and won a considerable share of the hon
! ors of thr night. The box office; taking?.
: for last night and to-night exceed $10,000.
j I^os Angeles will acquaint itself with De
; Lussan's Carmen to-night. She will re
: hat performance in Sacramento on
Thursday night to the most expensive au
-1 dience ever gathered In the Clunie Opera
, house. The Ellis Company gives a con-.
cert programs in Salt Lake on Saturday
! rclght.
Alhambra.
"Saved From the Flames" is the title
i of the melodrama in five acts that was
played in the Alhambra last night by Ag
nes Herndon, Albert A. Andruss and the
regular stock company. Miss Herndon,
assisted by a live baby, did her usual
large emotional acting, and Mr. Andruss
acquitted himself patnetically of the ex
convict hero. Stolen bonds, revolvers and
a burning tenement house are the prin
cipal properties of the plot. The audience
was numerous in the gallery and signified
its joy In a hundred characteristic ways.
Columbia.
The second week of the Bostonians- In
"Rob Roy" commenced last night to a
large audience. Opinions may differ as
to the value of the opera itself, but the
fact remains that the music and fun
seems to please the most of the people.
Days of the Horse Numbered.
The greatest electrician in the work! declares
that the days of the horse are numbered, and
that In a Bhort time electricity will completely
supplant man's most useful animal. In \!d
years, he asserts, the horse will be a curiosity.
| Diseases of the stomach, liver, kidneys and
' blood would alÂ»o be v curiosity if all sufferers
would take Hostetter'R Stomach Bitter?. Thert
would then be practically no dyspepsia, ner
vousnef-a. sleeplessness, indigestion, constlpa

melodrama in this city i.Â« now playing an

' large audience last night for the new
bill "The Fire Patrol," which was given
an elaborate production with nearly all ]
the old favorites in the cast. Oakland I
h-is long needed a permanent amusement
i house of this kind, where large audiences
make possible the giving of a good chow
at popular prices.
The Chutes.
Derenda, late of Derenda and Breen,
scored quite a hit; Laurant proved him
self a clever magician; Sherman and Mor

An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of ' the well known remedy,
Strut- of Figs, manufactured' by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as .they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy, are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company
printed on the front of every package.

WINDING AN OLD CLOCK.
Its progress is sometimes slow as that of a winding stream crossing a plain; and again it dashes to a conclu
sion with almost the rapidity of galloping consumption. Mr. Fiske's was the slow and sullen variety of the dis
ease Once in a while a sort of sub-crisis in it would occur when the best procurable medical skill was exhaust
ed on the case. So urgent did the doctors deem the situation that one or more of them would remain in the house
days in succession.
When the efforts of the medical men failed to bring about an Improvement in the patient, he himself dis
missed them saying he would take the chances of living or dying without anybody meddling further. "I had loot
faith," he says, "in" doctors and their prescriptions." The only grain of reason in this remark lies in the fact that
none' of their prescriptions benefited him. He was right. For doctors, like all other workers, must be judged not
by what they say, but by what they can do.
At this critical hour it chanced that Mr. Fiske heard of Warner's Safe Cure and began using it. He was an
old man then and the odds were "long" against him. But this time the prescription was right. In two months
he was able to ride out and had gained twelve pounds. Laying aside all other medicines and adhering to this one,
alone he was at length blessed with a perfect recovery. He is now about eighty-five years old, in excellent health,
and among the wealthiest and best-known residents of Lexington, Mass. But the clock was wound up not a mo
ment too soon.

"The human body," said Dr. Oliver Wen
dell Holmes, "is a seventy-year clock. The
Creator winds it up once when we are born,
and then delivers the key into the hands of the
Angel. of the Resurrection."
Yes, but they do not all run seventy years.
It depends largely on how they are treated.
Take the pendulum weight off the end of the
wire, and your clock will rattle away at the
rate of half a dozen hours in one. Neglect it
and it will run irregularly; now fast, now
slow. Break the mainspring or a wheel, and
it stops instantly. Take intelligent care' of it,
and a good clock will serve your grandchil
dren as faithfully as it now serves you.
There is an important difference, however,
between your clock and your body. Even
after the clock is completely run down, and at
a standstill, you can wind it up and set it
going again. Not so with the body. Once
stopped it goes no more.
It follows that if Mr. Orrin W. Fiske had
been "completely run down" at the time he
refers to I should not now be writing of him
as a living man. On a certain occasion a few
years since he sat for five weeks continuously
in a rocking chair, unable to lie down. At that
time he was nearly crushed with a combina
tion of complaintsâ influenza, bronchitis and
organic kidney disease. For a less cause than
this many human clocks have run down alto
gether and stopped dead. An analysis showed
Mr. Fiske's renal affection to be true Bright's
disease; a condition which even the best phy
sicians treat as of professional necessity; with
out expecting to overcome it. It is commonly
the final stage of a series of vascular degene
rations which begins in partial atrophy of the
liver and ends in death.

COUNTY JAIL
Brandes and a Trusty
in Combat.
ACCUSED MURDERERWORSTED
CHARGED P. CARLTON WITH
SCHEMING FOR "DOPE."
Protracted Delays in His Trial Cause
Him to Become Hilarious and
Say "Rubber Neck" to
Visitors.
Oakland Office Sen Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 27.
The large corridor at the County Jail
was the scene this morning of a fierce
and bitter encounter between William A.
Brandes, who is on trial for his life for
the brutal murder of his 13-year-old
daughter. Lillian, and Frank Carlton, a
â â¢trusty" who is serving ninety days for
come minor offense.
The protracted delays in Brandes' trial
have had the effect o"f making him bold,
presumptious and at times almost hilari
ous. W-en visitors call at the iron grat
ing to Bee len friend, Brandes
becomes quite loquacious to the unbear
able ami. name of other prisoners.
This morning shortly after 9 o'clock two
boys were brought into the main corri
dor. Their advent was heralded by
Brandes, who shouted 'â¢rubber neck.'"
"Trusty" Carlton, when the lads turned
to learn who thus accosted them, advised
Brand t to sneak away and hiJe,
but face the music."
Brandes resented this advice and ap
plied a vile epithet to the â¢'trusty," who
attempted to show his authority by
threatening violence. in an instant the
two prisoners were at each other's necks
and stunning blows were dealt. Other
prisoners tri'-d to separate the men, and
liartially succeeded, but the combat was
soon renewed, china and tin cups and
plates being this time used as weapons.
\larm was Immediately given and As
sistant Jailer George Taylor hurried into
the corridor and stopped further conflict
by locking Brandes up in his cell, very
much the worse In appearance. There
the accused murderer was kept the rest
of the day for fear of another outbreak.
There has b< en "bad blood" between
Brandes and "Trusty" Carlton for the
past several days.
"Brandes made an insulting remark to
me last Saturday in the presence of other
prisoners." said Ccrlton to a Call re
â¢â¢I am here because I disturbed
the peace of my folks in Alameda. My
whole troul used by the use of
'dope' and last Saturday a fric-nd of our
family who occasionally does missionary
work" in the jails, vistted this corridor
and 1 inquired of her about the health of
"When she loft Brandes blurted out
that 1 had asked her to sneak some 'dope'
Into the jail for me 1 was still too weak
at the timf and unable to make him eat
that Lie. To-day he shouted 'rubber neck'
at those boys and I told him to 'get next/
when he called me a vile name and tha
mixup followed." , .
Brandes' case will be resumed for argu
ment to-morrow.
CHARGED WITH BEING
CRUEL TO A HORSE
DR. SELFRIDGE ARRESTED BY A
LIVERYMAN.
Warrant Procured on the Advice of
the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Ani
mals.
OAKLAND, March 27.â Dr. Clarence
Gelfridge is charged with driving a valu
able horse in a cruel manner and render-
Ing the animal useless, and on Thursday
morning he will be tried before Justice
Larue in East Oakland.
Three weeks ago Dr. Selfridge hired a
rig from the Simonson stables in East
Oakland. He went away on Tuesday and
returned on Thursday. The animal was
In such a bad condition that It was placed
In charge of a veterinary surgeon. Where
Dr. Selfridge went and what he did with
the horse will be told Thursday morning
and much interest is being shown in the
trial nn account of the prominence of the.
young doctor. The proprietor of the
stable Bays the animal was an excellent
one and that a few days prior to hiring
Th'- rig to Dr. Selfridge he refused $15u
for it.
â¢'When the animal came back," said
he, "she was foundered. I never saw su<h
a wreck in my life, and although I think
now that she will recover she will be good
for nothing but the veriest old peddler's
cart. I called Dr. Selfridge's attention to
â what .he had done, but not until a day or
two hirer did it develop how thoroughly
the nnimal was used up. I don't know
â whether he drove her the â¢ whole of the
two days he was away, but she was a
veTy gpoedy animal and very willing, and
there is nn excuse for making a wreck
of her. I sent to Dr. Selfridge and asked
him to reimburse me, but he snapped his
finger? and told me to do as I pleased."
The case was reported to the Society
for the Prevention <>f Cruelty to animals
and -on the advice of its ncent a warrant
was sworn out in Justice Larue' s court.
CLOSED WITH A CLASH.
Oakland City Council Winds TJp
With a Row.
OAKLAND. March 27.â The old City
Council held its last meeting' to-night,
and next Monday night there will be
Beven new members among the eleven.
With the exception of approving the
minutes of the last meeting and passing a
bill of the Poundkeeper, nothing was
done.
The Poundman's bill produced positively
the last vestige of the regime of the solid
Bix. The bill was read as recommended
by the Finance Committee, and after its
passage it appeared that only two of the
five members had been present, which is
not a quorum. In the hall after adjourn
ment Glrard accused Woodward of at
tempting to "sneak" the bill through.
Colonel Woodward objected to the use of
the word "sneak," but Glrard was obdu
rate. For Severn 1 minutes the battle
raged loud and rapidly. A fist tight was
looked upon as a certainty, when friends
told the two men to go home.
THE RACETRACK MURDER.
Preliminary Hearing of John Epper
son's Alleged Slayer Has Been
Commenced.
OAKLAND, March 27.â The preliminary
examination of James J. Gilligan, charged
with the murder of John Epperson at the
notorious Office saloon at the Emeryville
racetrack, last Tuesday, was commenced
before Justice of the Peace Bradbury this
afternoon. The complaint sworn to by W.
J. Dreyer, proprietor of the saloon where
the alleged crime was committed, had
been dismissed and Deputy Marshal Lane
of Envryville swore to a new complaint.
The preponderance of testimony adduced
at the hearing to-day was most decidedly
favorable to the defendant, and grave
doubts are expressed as to the advisability
of holding Gilligan to appear before the
Superior Court. In fact, the opinion pre
vails that he will be released when the
hearing next Friday shall have been con
cluded.
ROMANTIC LIFE
IS ENDING IN
A MADHOUSE
Ex-Consul Churchill
Is Insane.
MADE HISTORY RAPIDLY
STARTED HIS CAREER IN OAK
LAND.
\
Alleged Proof of Bigamy "Was the
Beginning of the End ol
His Checkered
Career.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, March 27.
William Churchill, newspaper man, ex-
Consul and Bohemian, is in an Eastern
asylum. Six months ago he disappeared
from his home in Brooklyn and his wife
professed to know nothing whatever of
his whereabouts. It -was supposed that
he had committed suicide and his many
Oakland acquaintances believed this to be
the case. News was received to-day that
the once bright Englishman is a lunatic.
Churchill's checkered career commenced
in Oakland. Many years ago he drifted
into this city from Australia and his
hard-up condition appealed to the sym
pathy of many of Oakland's newspaper
men. They put him on his feet and stood
by him until he was independent of as
sistance. Then he showed up in his true
colors. He betrayed the confidence of one
of his best friends, broke up his home and
finally eloped with his friend's wife.
After doing newspaper work in Brook-
Ivn N T for some years Churchill per
suaded President Cleveland to appoint
him Consul to Apia. Soon after going to
the Islands a woman appeared in San
Francisco named Mrs. Holmes. one
declared she was Churchill's wife, he hav
ing married her by contract many years
ago and lived with her for some time
across the bay. Her proofs were appar
ently complete and she laid them all be
fore" Senator Perkins to place before
President McKlnley. Whatever effect
they had it is not known positively, but
some time later and long before his term
had elapsed Churchill was recalled. He
went back to newspaper work and was
enjoying life in the East when he sudden
ly disappeared. Nothing has been heard
o"f him since until to-day, when word was
received of his being confined in a mad
house.
MAY PAY ALIMONY AND
HIS WIFE IS DEAD
QUEER COMPLICATIONS OVER
MRS SHEPARD'S ESTATE.
Daughters Protest Against Their
Father's Account as Adminis
trator of the Deceased
Mother's Property.
OAKLAND. March 27.â John E. Shep
ard will probably find himself in the
strange but legally necessary position of
being compelled to pay alimony, though
his wife has been dead these past two
years.
In ' Judge Hall's court to-day Shepard
presented his account as administrator of
the estate of Catherine Shepard, who was
granted a divorce from him in 18S0. His
two daughters, Violet M., aged 18 years
and Kitty B. nged 16, represented by At
torney Carey Howard, vigorously pro
tested' against the account because he had
put in a claim for SSO as administrator.
The daughters showed that the father
had been ordered in 1880 to pay his di
vorced wife $30 monthly alimony, and that
he had paid but one Installment of $30
since then, leaving their mother to pro
vide -wholly for the family until her
death and he had never paid any back
alimony into the coffers of the estate.
About eighteen months ago Shepard ap- j
plied for letters of administration as did
also Mrs. Lydia Prescott; but he induced
his daughters to sign h'.s petition on the
condition that he would save the estate
from all expenses of administration, and
was granted letters. Now, in his account
he has made charges for money he claims
he advanced to the daughters, when n
reality the latter proved that he had sola
their furniture and given them the money
realized. As the hearing in the matter
Drogressed conditions became more and
more complicated, and Judge Hall de
rided that further testimony must be sub
mitted next Monday.
MRS. PICKETT VICTORIOUS.
She Is Finally Granted Letters on the
Estate of Her Sister, Mrs
Mary Hawley.
OAKLAND. March 27. âNettle F.
Pickett was granted letters of adminis
tration this afternoon by Judge Hall on
the estate of her sister, Mary F. Hawley,
deceased, and the petition of "William G.
Hawkett and others for letters was de.
nied.
Mrs. Hawley was supposed to nay*
committed suicide about a year ago. She
was found dead in bed beside her hus
band, who declared she had shot herself.
William E. Hawley, the husband, some
time ago was denied the probate of an
alleged will of his wife's, which was
shown to have been witnessed and at
tested-two weeks after Mrs. Hawley s
death That will was accordingly de
clared bogus. By Its terms real estate
valued at $20,000 was bequeathed to th*
husband, but a victorious contest ended
with the result named, and for the past
two months Hawley's whereabouts has
been unknown even to Mr. Hawkett, who
â represented him. '
The estate, comprising valuable real es
tate in Napa and Alameda counties, will
now be finally administered upon, and it
is not unlikely that the widower will be
overlooked in the distribution.
ORATORIO OF STABAT MATER.
Cleverly Rendered by Amateur Tal
ent in St. Joseph's Church.
ALAMEDA. March 27.â There was a
very enjoyable rendition of Rossini's Stn
bat Mater given at St. Joseph's Church
in this city on Sunday evening. The great
oratorio was in preparation but four
weeks and great credit is due Mrs. Wil
bourn for the excellent results achieve,].
She was to have sung "Quls Est Homo"
with Miss Marks, but suddenly lost her
voice on Saturday and Mrs. Van Pelt
took her place on this very short notice.
Herbert Williams, who has an unusu
ally pure' tenor voice, appeared to advan
tage in "Cujus Animan. "Pro Peccaris,"
the gem of the evening, a bass solo, fell
to Ed Eckart and "Fae ut Portem" was
cleverly rendered by Miss Clara McDer
mott of San Francisco. The choruses
werf mostly composed of local talent and
had been admirably trained by Mrs. Mar
guerite Wilbourn, the organist and di
rector of St. Joseph's choir.

LADIES RESENT
THE REMARKS
OF ELDER NYE
Speaks in Defense of
Roberts of Utah.
MAKES FUN OF PETITION
WOMEN AND MINISTERS ARE
CALLED IGNORANT.
His Talk Construed as a Reply to
the Mass Meeting at the-
Ebell Some Weeks
Ago.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. March 27.
The ladles of Oakland do not intend to
rest under the slur cast upon their integ
rity and intelligence by Elder E. H. Nye,
president of the California Mormon Mls-
Last nig-ht at a meeting of Oakland
Latter-day Saints. Mr. Nye defended Con
gTessman-eleet Roberts and said that igr-
norance is at the bottom of all the pro
tests against the Mormon church.
"Once the ball was started," said Elder
Nye, "It was very little trouble to get
women's clubs and Presbyterian ministers
to begin passing- resolutions and a petition
containing: hundreds of thousands of wo
men's names was sent to Congress asking
that body not to seat the man with three
wives."
Elder Nye seems to regard this action
as ridiculous, and follows up this senti
ment by saying: "A sum of money was
appropriated by Congress to build a home
for the cast-off Mormon wives. A mag
niiieent structure was built and it
stands to-day a splendid monument to the
national folly. Not one polygamous wo
man has ever crossed its threshold.
Elder Nye placed Mormonism and polyg
amy in a new light. He said: "Yellow
Journalism and our left-handed friends
have given you one view of the Mormon
question. I will give you the facts. B. H.
Roberts was llrst nominated for Congress
three years ago. He was chosen by ac
clamation by a convention led by non-
Mormons. Moses Thatcher was named at
the same time as a choice for Senator.
Shortly afterward both Roberts and
Thatcher were rebuked by the church for
having accepted the nominations, it being
supposed that their duties as apostles re
quired all their time. At once a clamor
was raised and the Mormon church was
charged with having re-entered politics.
The convention was reconvened and every
nnn-Mormon orator exhausted himself in
denunciation of the church for having
tried to govern the State. Not one single
word was spoken aoout polygamy. Tho
Democrats lost tne election.
"Last year Roberts was nominated
again and by tho same non-Mormon lead
ers, who saw in him the strongest man.
The silver question had changed thf> State
from Republicanism and the Republicans
saw that he was likely to win. It was
their time to attack the church, which
they had so encouraged two years before,
when It was rebuking candidate Roberts.
At once there went forth the howl, 'Po
lygamy.' "
A few weeks npro the most prominent
ladies of Oakland held a mass meeting
and uttered some strong language in de
fense <">f the home and in condemnation of
the principles advocated by Elder Nye.
His remarks last night are construed as a
reply to the ladles, who will soon hold
another meeting to resent the insinuations
of Mr. Nye.

A NEW PHASE
OF ALAMEDA'S
SCHOOL WAR
Lie Passed at a Pub
lic Gathering.
SULLIVAN WILL DO POLITICS
BROWN STIBS TTP A HORNETS
NEST AT LAST.
A Bitter Attack on the Board of Edu
cation Brings Out a Reply
That Was to the
Point,
ALAMEDA, March 27.â Brainard C.
Brown made another bitter attack on
the Alameda School Board this evening
at a meeting of the Municipal League.
His remarks were directed particularly
to School Superintendent Sullivan and
Director Lanktree. A sensation was cre
ated when Sullivan, who was in attend
ance, received permission to speak and
during the course of his address called
Brown a liar. It had been rumored
around town that Brown was going to
continue the controversy that has. so â 
wrought up Alameda, and a tremendous
crowd greeted him when he commenced
to speak. Briefly he said:
"That our Board of Education has long
been dominated by Messrs. Lanktree,
Tisdale and Sullivan Is notorious. Mr.
Sullivan, though not a member, Is no
doubt a much more dominant factor than
is Mr. C. A. Brown, who is a member. â¢
"During the last two years the board
has been run by the chairmen of the j
three most important committeesâ Lank- |
tree of the finance, Tisdale of classifica- I
tion and Brown of buildings and grounds.
Lanktree's appointment gave him the
placing of the insurance on the school
buildings. This has been placed at full
rates notwithstanding the fact that
statements were made that a reduced
rate could be obtained. Nor has Lank
tree ever been accused of rebating to the
city any portion of his 15 or 20 per cent
to which, as a broker, he is entitled as a
commission from the Insuring company.
Being an agent for a line of companies,
holding an influential position in the
School Department and Wing the gen
eral reputation of being In the pull 1 cer- ,
tainly his income as an insurance broker |
has not suffered. Quite naturally he de- I
"'"ThaTKossosses any qualification of j
mind training or experience which makes
him desirable as a member of the board
no unprejudiced person will affirm.
Smooth 'Jo Lanktree never opens his
m^uthln a rude or offensive manner, But
the influence of his 'fine Italian hand is
"l, to be a power, and the political ma- j
chine of this city would lose the master
mind which controls it were he to abdi
cate. By removing him from the board
his power in the department can be de- j
stroyed, for thus will he be taken from
his vantage ground, from which for
twelve years he has been able to do poll
tics' in Alameda. Thus will the 'push' be
forced to remove its blighting hand from
our public schools, which must not be al
lowed to suffer while politicians thrive.
Sullivan was white with rage w-hen no
arose to reply on behalf of himself and
Lanktree and Tisdale. He said:
"You have taken up the brown mans
burden and you must carry it. What he
says about me is utterly false. W hen a
man deliberately lies about me I consider
it my duty to tell him to his face that he
is a falsifier. I have been accused of do
ing politics in the school department, and
I deny the charge, but from to-night until
election day Sullivan will do politics and
Brown will feel the effects of It."
Crowds are discussing the affair on
the streets to-night, and friends of the
principals are on the alert to keep them
from clashing.
CHOSE DEATH BECAUSE
HER LOVER LEFT HER
MAY PrPEN"BERG ENDS HER
LIFE WITH CARBOLIC ACID.
Swallowed a Small Bottle of the Poi
son to Make Her Exit Per
fectly Sure.
OAKLAND, March 27.â Because her as
sociate left her. May Pipenberg, aped 2S
years, swallowed an ounce and a half of
carbolic acid to-night at the home of
Andy Ayers, 710 "Webster street, and died
an hour later at the Receiving Hospital.
The woman has passed under the namo
of Mary Donell for some time, and it is
supposed that Frank Donell is the man
she had referred to when she told Mrs.
Avers to-day that she was distrusted with
life on account of his leaving her.
The fatal dose was taken at about 6:30
o'clock. The deceased had Just finished
cleaning the dishes and remarked to Mrs.
Ayers and a visitor, Josanna Gobil, that
Fhe would retire to the bedroom a_nd rest
for a while. She had been out of their
pn-pence but a few moments when she
fell heavily to the, floor, whore John C.
Perry, a lodger, found her writhing: in
p.-Un, with a small bottle that had con
tained the deadly poison by her pule.
The woman was taken to the Receiving:
Hospital, but the efforts of Dr. Sanborn
and Steward IJorchard proved futile, and
before an hour had elapsed her form lay
on a slab in the morfruo. An inquest will
be held to-morrow night.
Deceased was formerly the wife of
Charles Pipenberg. who is serving a sen
| tence in San Quentin for grand larceny.
CORONER'S VERDICTS.
Suicide of a Dairyman and an Acci-
dental Death.
OAKI^AND, March 27.â At the Inquest
to-night of Swan Brown, the San Leandro
dairyman who hanged himself last even
ins, a note was exhibited, which deceased
had left, wherein he wrote that he had
been doctoring for a cancer on his cheek
the past three months and that he felt
worse than when he started; that his pain
had been so excruciating that he could no
longer stand It.
The cancer referred to was the result of
being hit by a stone thrown by a young
hoodlum some months previous. Brown
found death by climbing up a stepladder,
tying a bale rope doubled to a rafter
and jumping off the ladder. The Jury
brought in a verdict in accordance with
these facts. Deceased was a native of
Sweden, aged 75 years, and leaves a
widow in destitute circumstances.
The Coroner's Jury in the case of Ma
thieu Bourrouill, who was asphyxiated at
the Huff House last night while kneeling
by a chair, returned a verdict of acciden
tal death.
THE COURT FOOLED HTM.
John Book, a Chinatown Guide, In-
terferes With a Prisoner.
John Rook, a Chinatown guide, who is a
familiar figure around the Police Courts,
got himself into serious trouble yesterday
by interfering with a prisoner in Judge
Mogan's court.
Eva Smith was in court on a charge of
vagrancy. The Judge called her up and
asked who her bondsmen were. She re
plied that she did not know and the Judge
remarked that they were probably
"straw." He ordered her into custody.
While sitting in court Rook went up to
her and said: "Gome on." He took her
arm and led her out of the courtroom.
Bailiff Barry was notified and he hurried
after them, catching up with them on
McAllister street. He took them back to
the courtroom and the Judge ordered
Rook into custody for contempt, of court
and also ordered that a charge of vag
rancy be booked against him. The woman
was convicted on the charge of vagrancy
and ordered to appear for sentence this
morning.
MARINE FIREMEN'S FINANCES.
Preliminary Examination of Ex-
Financial Secretary Bernard
Ward Concluded.
The preliminary examination of Bernard
Ward ex-financial secretary of the Ma
rine Firemen's Union, on the charge of
felony embezzlement was continued be
fore Judge Conlan yesterday.
The defense put on three witnesses to
break down the evidence of John Dough
erty, ex-treasurer, the star witness for
the prosecution. William McManus tes
tified that Dougherty had told him he
had lost $1000 on the Corbett-Fitzsimmons
fight. Patrick Ward, the financial secre
tary, who succeeded Ward, testified that
Dougherty told him he- had the $4000 al
leged to have been embezzled by Ward in
a bag and lost it on the boat going across
to Oakland. Attorney Clarence Gray tes
tified that Dougherty had agreed to sign
a statement that Ward had nothing to do
with the defalcation.
Ward did not take the stand and the
Judge said he would look over the evi
dence and give his decision this morniny.

irty. A further reward

Oommissibner under the
of Governor
Markham, and served for more than
rears. After nearly nine years of
holding many persons supposed
that Mr. Kilburn would be permitted
to enjoy the sweet solace of private
intrammeled by the cares and re
sponsibilities of official position. The
â¢ of Salinas was not allowed
: :. of rest from public duty, aa
called upon him to
the people for four years more
as pr< sident of the .State Board of Har
ommissioners.
When the board meets to-day Mr.
Kilburn will doubtless present his cre
dentials in a pleasant style, and as his
appointment is recognized as straight
and regularâ free from any suspicion of
bricksâ -he will be invited by Commis
sioners Harney and Herold to take his
place at the head of the table.
F. S. Chadbourne may ap
n arnl present his
: credentials, or he may elect to
me time later In the season.
nel Chadbourne is not a stranger

>hould in- present himself at
. in tu.l uiiiturm Commissioner Ru
dolph Herald might surrender his seat,
but it is surmised that Colonel Chad
bourne will not use military force.
When he presents his credentials the
document will be closely inspected by
Commissioners Kilburn, Harney and
Herold. It <an be predicted to a cer
tainty that the invitation for the
take a seat as a member of
the board will not be unanimous. Many
of the Senators at Sacramento ex
pressed the opinion that Governor Gage
gave Colonel Chadbourne a gold brick.
In fact the Governor himself doubted
whether < hadbourne's appointment
would hold, but in deference to a de
sire among the friends of Colonel Chad
bourne that the appointment should be
made, the name was sent to the Senate,
.bourne has not made up
h's mind whether he will present tin
credentials to-day or later on. He will
confer with his attorneys this forenoon
and be guided by their advice. He went
to Sacramento with Governor Gage
Sunday evening and returned yester
day evening. At the Palace last night
Colonel Chadbourne was asked if he
â was not led to believe that he would
be appointed president of the board â
the position which went to Paris Kil
burnâand in reply said:
â¢'I have nothing to say on that sub
jectâwhether 1 was led to believe or in
fer this thing or that thing makes no
diffei â  >w."
When it was suggested that the ap
pointment which he secured resembled
a 'Sold brick," the colonel resented the
suggestion, Baying that the gold brick
1 as stuff.
"Here is the Issue," continued Colonel
Chadbourne: "I wis appointed Har
bor Commissioner to succeed Commis
r Herold. it was represented that
rrior Budd did not legally appoint
Mr. Herold. and, therefore, a vacancy
exist. 'l which Governor Gage had a
right to mi. 1 was appointed as a
Republican to Bucceed the Democratic
Commissioner. The contest is not he-
Mr. Herold and myself but be
tween the Republican and Democratic
s. It is the judgment of good
lawyers that Mr. Herold's appointment
will )i"t hold in the courts. One year
ago i surrendered the office which Mr.
Herold now holds because my. term of
four years had expired. 1 did not ques
tion "his right to succeed me, but in
troduced him to the board in a pleas
ant, friendly manner. We are still on
friendly terms. I shall not try to
k into the board with an ax and
he wil! r:<Â«t try to drive me from the
with an ax. The duty of making
the contest in the curts may devolve
upon me as the representative of the
blican party and I shall make a
us effort. It shall not be said
that 1 was weak and faltering in the
rmance "f my duty as a Republi
â 
Colonel Chadbourne was asked this
Lion: "Do you understand that
lissioner Herold will occupy the
.. the board -while you make the
st in the courts."
"1 am not prepared to speak on that
point. If I am not seated when mv
credentials are presented I shall insti
tut.- proper proceedings in the court to
obtain the seat."
The point is advanced that Mr. Her
old did not qualify as Commissioner
and file his bond within the time re
quired by the statute. This is one of. if
not the principal point relied upon by
thÂ«? Republicans.
Paris Kiiburn, at his home on the
hills north of Rerkeloy, was interviewed
last nisht. The story of a. private ar
rangement with Commissioner Colnon
is told in th<> Interview as follows:
OAKLAND, March 27.â Paris Kii
burn says he is already a Harbor
Commissioner and President of the
board and hns no necessity to present
credentials to-morrow.
"A few days ago," he said, "I met
I.lr. Colnon, and he said he was ready
to give way to inc. so we went down
to the Harbor Commissioners' office
and he showed me around. I filed my
credentials with the clerk last week,
and have already been a Commission-
er for several cbys. I asked Mr. Col
non whether any particular ceremony
had to be observed, and he said that
he knew of none. Not even a meeting
is necessary for a change of Commis
sioners. Mr. Colnon was presiderrt of
the board and I have succeeded him.
At the meeting to-morrow., if one be
held. I shall preside, and I do not
know if Mr. Colnon will be on hand
at all. He is no longer a member of
the board.
"I do not know anything of what Mr.
Chadbourne may do. hut I will say that
I do not anticipate any trouble or fric
tion whatever. If any contention
should arise between Mr. Herold and
Mr. Chadbourne I suppose thr courts
must settle it. I certainly will not pre
tend to say now which one 1 would rec
ognize at a board meeting, because ! do
not anticipate any such difficulty aris
ing.
"I do not know if Mr. Chadbourne
riled his credentials with the secretary
â¢ a few days ago, as I did, but I am in
clined to think not."
Commissioners Harney and Herold
have no official knowledge that Paris
Kilburn is a member of the board.
They saw Mr. Colnon transacting busi
ness in the usual way at the old stand
yesterday. He was certainly perform
ing the functions belonging to the of
fice of president of the board and no
one questioned the right of perform
ance. His fellow Commissioners were
not apprised of any change in the presi
dency of the commission.
There wili be a meeting a the hoard
this afternoon at 2 o'clock. Commis
sioners Harney and Herold expect that
some preliminary business will be
transacted, after which Mr. Kilburn
will present his credentials, including
the certificate of the Secretary of State
that his bond has been approved and
filed as the law requires. When such
presentation is made the Commission
ers will direct that the credentials be
spread upon the minutes.
In this proceeding there will be no
departure from the usual and time
hnnored course of introducing a new
member of the board. Mr. Kilburn will
not be recognized Its a member of the
board until his credentials are so pre
sented and accepted.
The record of Commissioner Herold's
appointment by Governor Budd will
clear away some erroneous notions on
that point. On March 14. IS<>7, Governor
Budd sent a communication to the Son
ate asking permission to appoint Mr.
Herold for a t^rm beginning March 13,
IS9S. On March 19, ISiiT. the Senate con
firmed the appointment. On March 13,
l*fÂ»s. Governor Budd issued the com
mission to Mr. Herold and on the fol
lowing day Mr. Herold qualified as a
Commissioner.
THERE WILL BE
NO CHILDREN
OF THE OWL
Coming Election in
Bohemia.
There will bo. an election in P.nhemia
noxt month and the. owl is pluming him
self for tho pvpnt. but there is not that
enthusiasm which generally marks the
days preceding the club's annual choice
of officers. There is but one ticket In
tho field so far. and there is not even a.
hint of opposition, .and within three
weeks the one-sided tight will be on un
less some, good Bohemians will get to
gether to raise political trouble.
The election this year will be an event
in more ways than one. Hitherto the
owl has always had two or three of his
own chosen people among the aspiring,
but this year the ticket is given over to
mammon. There is a solitary lawyer in
the bunch, but the rest are from the
walks of trade â birds of the day and not
of the night; creatures of the counting
house and the cash book, not real fancy
free children of the owl. The ancient bird
will sit in solitary state in the council
and long for some kindred spirit to plead
for the men on the tag list and the due
book. It will be a commercial board, a
body of men to whom prompt "payments
ami regular hours are matters of exist
ence and so the owl is not looking for
ward to the election with much interest.
As presented by the nominating com
mittee, the ticket is as follows: Vander
lynn Stow, president ; W. <;. Stafford,
vice president; T. M. I'ennell, secretary;
Howard ( '. Houghton, treasurer; V i'
Grifneld. P. P. Deering, C. O. G. Miller
and Kirkham Wright, directors.
They are all good men and loyal, earn
est club members, but they are not
drawn from the Bohemian clement which
made the club a possibility and then a
success. There is a si^h of regret over
this fact from more than one quarter of
the spacious rooms on Post street, but
the true Bohemian is not a business man
and it has come to pass that the con
cerns of the owl must he looked after by
men who know the clink of gold and who
can keep the glittering circles from fly
ing too fast.

ONE WHO KNOWS TALKS PLAIN
SCHEMES USED TO COERCE LEG
ISLATORS.
Startling Revelations Made in a Pa
per Read Before the Presby
terian Ministerial
Union.
When preachers of tho gopp^l turn their
attention to politics there is likely to bo
a shaking up of things political.
So it was that whon the Rev. Barton
W. Perry was appointed chaplain of the
Assembly during the session of the Leg
islature Just closed, and when he took
an active interest aid part in the polit
as well as the spiritual
that body it was to he < xpected that
something would happen. It happened
yesterday mornintr at a meeting of tho
Presbyterian Ministerial T'nion. of which
tho lato chaplain of tho Assembly is a
member in pood standing.
â¢ During his stay in Sacramento the Rev.
Mr. Perry accumulated a goodly store of
political impressions. That his impression
of Han Runis was not pleasing is staling
the c;.fc- BO mildly as to do the reverend
gentleman a grave injustice. His hatred
and contempt of Burns and his methods
as exemplified during the session of the
legislature would, if printed, make a
largo volume, but for the benefit of his
brethren of the Ministerial I'nion he has
so abbreviated them as to be able to set
them down on a few sheets of paper. This
paper ho nail yesterday morning under
a question of personal privilege.
The charges that Rev. Mr. Terry makes
against Burns and his coworkors in the
political field at Sacramento are suffi
ciently grave to warrant the attention of
every citizen who lias the welfare of the
community at heart. What Ik- has to
say will not he news to a majority of
those who were in Sacramento during the
session and had an Intimate knowledge of
the situation, but it will probobly prove
to b< a revelation to those who wore so
fortunate as to he able to keep away from
the capital during the progress of the
Senatorial contest.
Rev. Mr. Perry also pays a. high com
pliment to the Senatorial candidates other
than Hums and applauds the manhood of
the legislators who resisted evory at
tempt to debauch them and who voted
against Burns to the end in order to save
the good name of the Slate and the Re
publican party. Following is the paper in
full:
It has been my privilege to he associated,
for the past throe months, with the law
makers of the State, in the rapacity of
chaplain of the Assembly. I was appoint
ed by request of Hon. Joseph R. Know
land, a gentleman who supported General
Barnes for Tniteil States Senator. My per
sonal choice for Senator vraa Robert N.
P.ulla. 1 w.ir Inclined to Mr. Bulla from
the first because be was from the south,
the home of the retiring Senator, and be
cause the north was so ably represented
by Senator Perkins. The more 1 saw of
Mr. Bulla the more I realized his great
worth. He is the soul of honor and in
tegrity and has legal and legislative abil
ity of the highest order. General Barnes
surpasses Mr. Bulla in one respectâ that of
oratory. Hut that one item would have
placed <'alif"rnia by the side of New York
and ("hauncey M. DepfeW.
I had little to fay in regard to the Sen
atorial question until near the close of the
Bession, and would not have taken any
active part if the facts which I will sub
mit to you had not come to my attention.
I had good friends among: the Grant,
Barnes, Scott and Bulla forces. I listenpd
to what was told me and after awhile
accumulated quite a fund of information.
Under the circumstances it was n*
to weigh the various rumors with judicial
<ar<- in order to arrive at the truth. My
newspaper experience enabled me to sift
the evidence.
In regard to the following 1 can give the
Banes, dates and places. These facts are
so abominable that no man interested in
the welfare of this State and clean politics
can be silent.
First â Cm a certain day a member, an old
Eoldier, was brought into the joint Assem
bly In a state of intoxication. Certain
workers for D. M. Burns had helped this
man into this Condition; had taken him
to a house of ill-fame, and, while intoxi
cated, had pledged him to vote for L). M.
Burns for Senator.
Secondâ On a certain w*ek a member of
the joint Assembly received from four dif
ferent immoral women, working in the in
terest of r>. M. Burns, invitations to go to
their private rooms.
Thirdâ On a certain day a member of the
joint Assembly, a married man. was filled
â¢with wine: taken to a house of ill-fame in
stead of his boarding house as he requested
When he woke up in the morning he found
he was not alone. Then he waa informed
that If u e did n. t vote for D M. Burns
his wife would he notified. He stood the
teal and never voted for Burns. They, true
to their satanic threat, Bent an anonymous
letter to his wife. She came to Sacramento
â¢ â  told her th>> whole truth,
him because he had no( disgrai '1
â  when sober, bj voting for D. M.
Burns.
Other thinKs came later, such as the offer
of State position! to embers of the joint
Assembly, or, if the position could not he
delivered, the salary would be paid for the
full time, also the attempted bribery of
General Barnes, Irving M. Scott and U.

There were PtKhty-flw Republicans in the
Joint Assembly anil thirty belonged to Dan
Burns. The thirty contained a few brlÃht.
Intelligent men: the others were racetrack
gamblers, forgers, bribe-takers, and one
was under the charge of murder during the
whole session. The fifty-five men repre-
Bented the brains, integrity and honor of
the Republican majority. As it took sixty
one to elect a Senator the fifty-five could
not have succeeded even if they united on
one man.

influence of liquor and left the
house on Sunday.
On Sunday evening he hired a
cheap room in the lodging-house, 417
Hush street. At half-past 5 o'clock
a man sleeping in an adjoining
apartment heard the report of a
firearm in the room occupied by
Straub and notified the landlady.
An entrance was forced into the
room and Straub was found welter
ing in his blood and dead. The body
was taken in charge hy the Coroner.
Mrs. Diedrich said that Straub
had exhausted all his funds and
had become very despondent over
his failure to pet work, but she had
no suspicion that he would attempt
to make away with himself. The
landlady of the Bush-street lodging
house said that the money which
Straub paid for the room seemed to
be all he had.

dition of the pores. CUTICURA SOAP combines delicate emol-
lient properties derived from CUTICURA, the great skin cure,

NEWSBOYS' UNION IN
BUSINESS AND FUN
ELECT OFFICERS AND PERFECT
ORGANIZATION.
Fully three hundred newshoyp crowded
into the old Breeder and Sportsman build-
ing on Bush street lasr. night to elect a
president for their newly formed union.
And these three hundred news mer-
chants, who represent all classes of San
Francisco street life, conducted their
business as seriously as a body of law-
makers. Of course there was little order;
but what power on this earth can still the
tongue or conquer the spirit of the news-
boys. Captain Wittman sent two of his
big, burly policemen to keep the peace
and their presence was regarded as a
gross insult to the dignity of the News-
boys' Union. "Happy Dougherty had
charge of the door, and when the â¢'cops"
made their appearance "Happy" shout-
ed, "Cheese it. pals, we're all pinched"
here cums der bulls."
"Ah. kick yerselt' wid yer good foot
'Happy,' " retorted Geese O'Nie!, "ain't
Mayer Felan gonter be our tresurer.
Dese hun'-a-mont' coots is comin' U r ter
tro' out ded wones."
And the two policemen armed with
slats were allowed to enter the hall.
Slats, however, had no terrors for the
newsboys. They would rather i>.- warm-
ed with a slat in the hands of a "cop"
than sit alongside of a hot stove on a
winter's morning.
When "Bucco" Crowley called the meet-
ing to order "Spider" Foley arose with
due solemnity and suggested that the bal-
loting for president be commenced.
