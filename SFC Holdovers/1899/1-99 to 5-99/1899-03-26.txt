McKINL EY THE CHOICE
OF THE REPUBLICANS
ASHINGTON, March
25. â During the clos
ing days of the
Fifty-fifth Congress
a canvass was made
of the Republican
side of the House of
Representatives for
the purpose of ascer
taining the opinion of the members as
to who will he the Republican nominee
for President in 1900.
One hundred and fifty-three members
v.-ere interviewed and they represent
between 75 and 80 per cent of the at
tendance at the exciting finish of a
" notable Congress.
Every man -was asked: "Who, in
your judgment, will be the choice for
President of the Republican National
Convention which will assemble in the
Bummer of next year?
reason for that
m."
This is a summary of the canvass:
One hundred and twenty-seven mem
bers express? i thÂ» belief or conviction
that President 11 Kinley will be re
nominated: one member believes Ad
miral George Dewe'y will be the choice
of the convention: one v. ember said
that it wag hi? opinion that Governor
Hazen P. Flnjrree of Michigan will be
nominated: only four members refused
to discuss the subject.
Every State whose Congressional del
egation contained -a Republican â with
the exception of Texas, which has one
Republican member out of thirteenâ
is represented.
Those interviewed represent these
States: Alabama. California, Connecti
cut. Illinois', Indiana. lowa, Kansas,
Kentucky. Mai tie. Maryland, Missouri.
Massachusetts. Michigan. Minnesota,
Nebraska; New Hampshire. New Jer
sey, Now York, North Carolina. North
Dakota, Ohio. Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont,
Virginia, West Virginia and Wiscon
sin/
It was my purpose to obtain the
views of a majority of the Republi
cans in every delegation, and with a
few exceptions this was accomplished.
Thus, it is plainly evident there is
practical unanimity of judgment that
McKinley will be renominated.
An analysis of the vote at the St.
Louis convention of 1596 shows that the
vote given to Quay, Morton and Alli
son was merely complimentary, coming
chiefly as it- did from their respective
Ftates. McKinley's leading competitor
for the nomination was Thomas B.
Reed of Maine, though he was far from
formidable, as the figures indicate.
Heed's strength, of course, came from
New England. Local pride as much a.=?
anything else dictated the action of thÂ«? i
d^i^sates from that section.
\ The name of Mr. Reed, in the best i
judgment even of pome of the most :
representative men of the famous gal
axy of States In the Northeast, will not
be considered by the convention in 1900.
"Without a single exception the New :
England members of > the Fifty-fifth
Congress whom I was able to talk to on
the subject failed to mention the name
of the great Speaker as a Presidential
possibility next year. Their opinion Is
unanimous that McKinley will be the
nominee. New England at the close of
the last session had twenty-five Re
publican Representatives. Of this num
ber seventeen answered the queries
propounded.
One member who said McKinley will
be the man requested that his name be
omitted from the list, because he did
not wish to disturb the pleasant rela
tions he had with Speaker Reed.

BUCHANAN
IS PERSONA
NON GRATA
American Minister to Ar-
gentina Not Successful
as an Arbitrator.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Kerala Copyrighted 1.. J. by James Gor

, BUENOS AYRES, March 25.âWil
liam I. Buchanan. United States Minis
ter, has Informed the Argentina. Gov
ernment concerning his award on the
Punta de Atacama question and giving
the territory in dispute to the Chilean
republic. Public opinion generally is
little satisfied.
La Prer.Ka says the cedÂ»d property is
lof little arf-a, and that Argentina
never discussed its material value, but
stood for the unity of her frontier and
the Integrity of her territory. "She
never a< ted as a merchant," it con
tinues, "but as a nation. Although
Chile will not get all she wanted, that
which shÂ» obtained is pure profit. The
award is a now triumph of her tra
ditional policy, which consists in claim
ing much with the object of getting
something."
La Nacion says that the award can
not satisfy the legitimate aspirations
of Argentina- "Mr. Buchanan," it
adds, "evidently obeyed political and |
not purely legal reasons, nevertheless
Argentina respects the award, consid
ering the matter as definitely closed."
El Diario believes that the territory
awarded to Argentina is not what she
hoped to obtain, but is what logically
could be expected in view of the ob
ject pursued by this form of settle
ment.
El Tiempo says that apparently Mr.
Buchanan did r.ot study the matter
with the seriousness which it required.
The same paper blames the Argentine
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and fin
ishes by saying, "Argentina never ob
tained any gain by arbitration.' 1
El Nacional severely blames Mr. Bu
chanan, saying that the award was
contrary to the treaty of 1881, and that
the American Minister has gone be
yond hiÃ functions, giving to Chile ter
ritory situated on this side of the Cor
dilleras. "Mr. Buchanan," it says,
"sought to satisfy both panties and did
not prove to be an impartial Judge."
La Tribuna. President Roca's official
organ, does not comment on the award.

AN EPIDEMIC
OF MURDER
IN ENGLAND
Four Assassinations and One
Execution During
the Week.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. ISO 9, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, March Another et>l
demic of murder seems to have broken
out. Last week there were two mur
ders and two executions. This week
there has been one execution and four
murders, the startling feature about
which is that in no case have the police
so far found any clew to the perpetra
tor of the crimes.
Murder by post, which has been
creating a sensation in New York,
found an imitation here in pieces of
poisoned wedding cake being sent
through the post. Only one death re
sulted, which is fortunate, because an
examination showed that the cake con
tained a very acute poison. No one
seems to know where the cake came
from, which leads the police to sus
pect that the poison did not get int,o
the cake by misadventure, but that the
cake was made with the deliberate In
tent to cause death.
The verger of a church In Cambridge
avenue has been killed by poison and
his wife has disappeared, no one knows
where.
A woman has been found in Ratcliffe
in bed with her ribs broken and head
crushed, and at Newmarket a police
man found a gardener in a most shock
ing condition. It is supposed that he
had disturbed housebreakers, who
killed him to prevent them from being
hunted down.
In another case, out of a spirit of re
venge, some one tried to poison a whole
family with arsenic in pepper, and the
family became very ill and had a nar
row escape, but eventually recovered.

WASHINGTON, March 25 âNaval offi
cers are much interested in the proposi
tion for the organization of a naval re
serve in Hawaii. J. R. Castle of Hono
lulu formerly secretary of the Hawaiian
Legation at Washington, recently applied
to the Navy Department for information
as to the method of forming a naval re

An organization of the kind proposed in
Hawaii will prove a good adjunct to the
regular navy in future operations in the
Pacific, and the movement will therefore
receive cordial support from officials of
the navy.

AMERICANS
IN DANGER
OF DEATH
Six Filibusters to Be Shot
by Central 'American
Authorities.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
N*i:\V FORK. March 25. â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: Besides Immediately dis
ting a gunboat to make an Inves
tigation, Secretary Hay has cabled to
the American Charge d'Affaires at
Guatemala City and the American
Consul ai Tegucigalpa, directing them
to make protests to the Guatemalan
and Honduran governments against
the execution of six Americans who
were arrested a few days ago and sen
tenced to be shot.
Th>- action of the administration was
taken upon the representations. of Sen
ator Cockrell of Missouri, who had re
ceived a telegram from former Gover
nor Stone setting forth the peril of the
men as told by their friends in Mis
souri, and of other advices In the pos
session of the State Department. Gov
ernor Stone's telegram to Senator
Cockrell simply stated that six men
had been arrested, one of them being
C. W: Guthrey, and had been sen
tenced to be shot.
When the Senator presented the dis
patch to Secretary Hay to-day he
urged that official to take all steps pos
sible to protect the Americans.
Secretary Hay at once wired the rep
resentatives of this Government in
Guatemala and Honduras, and then,
as it -tfas the desiFe of the American
Charge d'Affaires at Guatemala City
and at the recommendation of Senator
Cockrell, he requested the Navy De
partment to order the gunboat Machias
to make an investigation. Instructions
were at once sent by Secretary Long to
Commander L. C. Logan, commanding
the Machias, directing him to proceed
promptly to Livingstone, Guatemala,
and make strict investigation of all the
circumstances leading up to the ar-
rests.
There seems to be some doubt as to
the point where the men are impris
oned, but by the time the Maohias ar
rives at Livingstone the American Con
sular offices will have reported and the
Machias will be within a short run of
any port along the coast. Livingstone
lies on the Gulf of Amatique. not far
from the Honduran frontier, and a
short distance from Puerto Cortes,
where the Machias was temporarily
stationed some days ago while Com
mander Logan investigated the mur
der of an American named Frank
Pears.
THE IRISH
NATIONALISTS
TO CONFER
To Hold a Meeting in Dublin
on the Fourth of
April.
PrÂ»cial Dispatch to Thf> Call.
NEW YORK, March 25.â A special
cable to the World from Dublin says:
Trie most serious attempt to reunite
the [rtsh Nationalist members of Par
liament sinre the Parnell split will be
made in the City Hall here on April 4.
The conference, to which all the Na
tionalist members of Parliament of all
sections are invited, will assemble on
that day with the object of arriving at
a Stasis of unity and common action
for the future in and out of Parlia
ment. This conference is the result of
energetic measures taken by the Lim
erick corporation to ascertain the feel
ins of other public bodies throughout
Ireland having Nationalist majorities
I on the subject of reunion and cessation
i of internecine strife.
Dillon and a majority of those whoact
with him immediately accepted the in
vitation to the conference. Healy
| and several of his collagues also sig
nified their intention to be present, but
John Redmond has not yet replied.
Redmond may refuse to have anything
to do with the Dublin conference.
It is not certain, either, whether it
will be attended even by Healy and his
followers if Redmond remains away, as
he almost surely will.
Thus a malign fate seems to follow
every attempt to restore unity to the
Irish factions. The Irish party has no
real chairman at present, the election
having been deferred at Dillon's sug
gestion until after the Dublin confer
ence. If that conference fails the possi
bility of agreeing upon a chairman will
be more remote than ever.

ANILA, March
25. â At 6 o'clock
this morning an
advance was be-
gun all along the
lines from San
Juan del Monte to Caloocan. The
entire division under General
Mac Arthur was engaged in the
movement, the brigades being
commanded by Generals 11. G.
Otis. Hale, Hall and Wheaton.
The Nebraska and Colorado
volunteer regiments encountered
the first strong resistance. This
was at San Francisco del Monte
and in the surrounding trenches.
The cavalry outflanked the
enemy, who broke and ran, suf
fering severe loss, but the enemy
made a stubborn stand in the
woods north of La I -oma Church.
The Twentieth Kansas and the
Tenth Pennsylvania regiments,
with the Montana Volunteers on
the left, protected by the Utah
Battery, advanced over the open
rice fields. The enemy, strongly
entrenched in the woods, kept up
a steady tire until the Americans
were in close quarters. Then the
rebels fled through the woods un
der a raking fire.
It is reported that the bodies
of 125 dead rebels were found in
the trenches and many more in
the woods.
General Hale's brigade was
soon followed by General Harri
son G. Otis' brigade. General
Wheaton's brigade was held back
to wait until the line should
swing in from San Francisco del
Monte to Polo, and thus box up
a large number of insurgents.
The insurgents opened fire on
our right and the fire was grad
ually extended along their whole
line for two miles. Our advance
was over open ground for a mile
and a half. The Third Artillery
acting as infantry at the apex, on
which the line was to turn, got
the hardest fighting. It was in a
perfect hell during a mile and a
half and lost nine per cent of its
men. One mile beyond the open
the artillery reached Talighan
River. The ford was defended
by an insurgent blockhouse, and
Lieutenant Abernathy, of the
Third Artillery, and some of his
men swam the river and flanked
the block house. Lieutenant
England then crossed the ford
under the enemy's fire. The in
surgents fought hard. I counted
twelve dead about the block
house.
The Third Artillery crossed the
river an- hour and a half before
any of the other troops. Later
the KAnsas volunteers came up
on our left and crossed the river
under fire. They lost eight men
and found twenty-seven dead Fil
ipinos on the bank. The insur
gents stopped firing when our
doctors went forward to get the
Filipino wounded.
On the left, toward the sea,
Wheaton's brigade pounded its
way through three series of insur
gent trenches, and the Oregon
regiment lost at least forty men.
Hale's brigade is on the right
and swinging from the right to
morrow, it hopes to surround the
insurgents at Polo.
The insurgents fought well,
and our loss was the greatest in
the campaign in proportion to
the number of troops engaged.

MANILA. March 2<>â 8:15 a. m.~
Twenty-six dead and 150 wounded in a
"hospital is the latest statement of the
American losses in the engagement
.with the Filipinos.
. To-day's fighting furnished a speci
men of the difficulties with which the
'American? have to contend. The Fili
pinos never, except at Malabon, per
mitted their opponents to get' within
â¢several hundred yards of them. They
would-fire a few volleys from their
cover and then Seattle back to another
.rover, repeating these tactics for .miles.
ttt&Wy of the trenches had gullies and
.connecting paths through ttie cane
and brush, enabling them to retreat un
seen.
The problem ;he Americans have to
face is to drive or lure the insurgents
to fight in force. The trenches seem
thinly manned, except in the vicinity of
-Malabon.
The Americans, fighting a hidden foe,
'suffered greater loss in proportion than
..did the enemy. The loss of the Fili
pinos had formerly been estimated
from the number of bodies found scat
â¢ tered in the swamp and through the
.brush. A larger percentage of the en
emy's wounded died than of the Amer
icans, many of them perishing from
neglect, the Americans naturally at
tending their own men first.
â¢ The wounded, after treatment in the
field hospitals, were brought to the hos
pital by train. Several trips were made

with Spain. Every officer was intently
l".,king *or every scrap of information
as to the progress being made by -Gen
eral Otis' gallant expeditionary forces.
It was noted that the movement was
being executed like clockwork. It was
necessarily one of great rapidity, yet ,
the officials noted with delight the per- ',
fection of the arrangements as revealed <
in the press dispatches, the rapid work
of the signal men, well up with the !
troops in the advance running their !
wires, the ambulance corps close up to
the fighting lines and the pressing for- ;
ward of supplies. i
Although the f>nii was not known
when the department closed, the great
est confidence was shown by the offi
cials in the complete success of the
American arms and there was nothing
but praise heard for the strategy ex
hibited by Otis and his generals. Mac-
Arthur especially came in for commen
dation, being the active leader of the
advancing column thrown first against
the insurgents' line. The opinion ex
pressed at the department, was that the
American troope would bivouac on the
field, or rather in the Jur.Ki". ana would
take up th>? forward movement imme
diately the sun rises to-morrow. There
was no question about stopping at this
point. The movement was intended to!
break the rebel power, and it would be
pushed to the utmost until the rebels
surrendered or fled beyond reach in the
mountains and jungles.
It is saicl at the department that Otis
has under his command in Manila and
vicinity about 27,000 soldiers; Aguin
aldo, according to Otis' last report, has
30.000 armed men. General Corbin es
timates that the American flying col
umn was about 10.000 men strong. The
insurgents, according to Otis, had about
men in Jine. But Aguinaldo-'s re
serve, 8000 strong, is not far distant
frr.m the scene of the firing line; in
deed, it is suspected that some r.f them,
including the leader himself, may have
been drawn into to-day's struggle, in
which case the odds would have been
heavily against the Americans. The
latter appear to be taking full advan
tage of the great assistance to be found
in the possession of the railroad, for
their movement to-day was generally
parallel to the road at all points.
There is a possibility of confusion
over the' names of Generals Hale and i
Hall. General Irving Hale was colonel
of the Colorado Infantry and has been
promoted to be brigadier general of
volunteers. General Robert H. Hall
was formerly colonel of the Fourth In
fantry and has been promoted to be
brigadier general of volunteers. Both
of these men were in the engagements
of to-day north of Manila.
An inquiry was made as to Why so
large a proportion of the volunteer
troops were thrown into the advance.
It was answered at the department
that these particular volunteers were
actually more veteranized than many
of the regulars. They have been in
service now nearly a year, and in that
time have seen more fighting than any
other branch of the army. They have
an advantage over the regulars who
have just arrived in their knowledge of
jungle fighting, acquired through their
long stay at Manila. Then it is feid
to be the part of prudence to maintain
a strong reserve of the most reliable
men in such a movement as that now
going on, and General Otis in his dis
patch of yesterday emphasized the ne
i cessity of maintaining the old battle
! lines surrounding the city.
NOT A BELIEVER

A Los Aogeles School Patron
Creates ao Abundarjce
Of Trouble,
LOS ANGELES, March 25.â teachers have been suspended, a
pupil has been debarred from the privileges of the school and a patron of
the Institution makes some unpleasant charges against the Board of
Education. All this results from the refusal of a school patron to comply
with the vaccination law in regard to his son.
Walter Duzan was one of the children who, on February 13, was dis
missed from school because he had not been vaccinated.' The children
that afterward complied with the rule were readmitted to the school".
In the confusion incident to promotions Walter Duzan slipped in and
continued to attend for five weeks before the fact was discovered that
the boy. had no vaccination certificate. The matter was brought to the
notice -of the school superintendent, Professor T. ,L Phillips, the prin
cipal, and George Abrams, the teacher in whose room Duzan studied.
The boy was sent home, but twice each day he is sent to school by his
father. Each time he is led from the school grounds by the substitute
principal now in charge. " .-â 
. . The father says he will continue this course until the board is forced
to arrest the boy. .Then he will fight. the law in the courts.
"My boy shall not be vaccinated and he Shall go to school, said
Duzan.

Have Seized Five
Vessels.
STORIES OF MURDER
Captain and Mate Slain and Other
Members of Crews Are
Missing.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, March 25.â The
steamer Tacoma, which, arrived here
this afternoon, brought news that a
robbery and murder were committed
under peculiar circumstances on the
steamer Kwonghoi, Captain MacKen
zie, which arrived in Manila on the 12th
ult. from Calbayog, in the island of
Samar.
The mate of the Kwonghoi was in
vited ashore to a native â¢'fiesta," from
which he returned late, at night. As he
climbed up the Jacob's ladder on the
ship's deck he saw three of the native
crew dodging down on their knees. be
hind a hatch. This led him to inspect
the deck and then he made the discov
ery that six of the Filipino crew car
ried by the steamer were breaking into
the vessel's treasure room, in which
was a large amount of money to be used
in the purchase of hemp. Upon being
discovered the natives attacked the
mate and beat him over the head with
clubs. While he was in an insensible
condition they threw him into a boat
I alongside. They then abstracted two
cases of $5000 each from the treasure
room and made for the shore in the
ship's boat. Since then nothing was
heard of the men. The body of the un
fortunate mate was found with the
throat cut and horribly mutilated near
a native village. .
Captain MacKenzie thinks the sailors
had plotted the robbery on previous
voyages with coconspirators on shore,
as the steamer frequently takes Jaxge
sums of money to the agencies, of its
owners along the coast.
The Manila Times of February 16 has
another story of Filipino treachery. It
says that a report has reached Manila
of the seizure by the insurgents of five
American steamers the Saturnus, San
Joaquirt, Don Jose, Gloria and San Pe
dro. The captain of the latter was
murdered. All were- seized primarily
by the Filipino members of their crews,
for all steamers freighting in those
waters carry a large number of Fili
pinos. In every case these mutinied,
ran '.he vessels in the nearest port
where .the insurgents were still in
power and turned the steamers over to
them.
The San Joaquin left Manila for Cov
ayan, Currimar and Aparri on Janu
ary 21, and was four days out of port
when the master was jumped on from
behind, trussed and made a prisoner
in . his own cabin. The vessel was
! beached and turned over to the rebels
and the captain, together with a Scotch
engineer, the only two white men on
the boat, were released. : They made
; their way to Manila after an arduous
trip in a small sloop given them by
the natives and reported the loss of
their ship. :â 
The Saturnus left for San Fernando,
Cavayan, Currimar, Aparri and San
Domingo on February 1. She is re
ported to have been seized after a mu
tiny between the first two ports, but '
'he Saturnus left for San Fernando,
vayan, Currimar. Aparri and San
I'lfngo on February 1. She is " re
â 'ed to have been seized after a mu
y between the first two ports, but
no "details were learned.
The Gloria also- left on February 1.
She was bound to Cavayan, Currimar
and Aparri. Beyond the report of her
seizure nothing could be learned of her.
The San Pedro was bound to Aparri
and the two usual way ports. She left
en February 1 and on the 10th her crew
mutinied. The captain put on a bold
front and with revolver in .hand en
deavored to drive the mutinous Fili
pir; is into the forecastle. Suddenly he
wa â ; felled by a blow from a big knife,
thrown by a Filipino at his back. As
he 'ell the natives rushed at him and
bert him to death with belaying pins.
A fciate and two engineers are missing.
.#â ll the steamships mentioned were
lor% overdue when the news of their
seizure reached Manila. Nothing can
be Seamed of the Gloria, news of their
ure reached Manila. Nothing can
earned of the Gloria, but vague re
points have arrived of her seizure.
SPANISH OFFICERS
PREDICT A FAILURE
MADRID. March 25.â Spanish officers
acquainted with the Philippine Islands
continue to predict the failure of Ma
jor General Otis' campaign, notwith
standing the American success. They
say that while the Americans will un
doubtedly win all the battles they will
los<- the "campaign itself, owing to the
aptitude of the "Tagallos to conduct a
war of surprises and ambuscades.
Malolos, the capital of the rebel gov
ernment, they add, will fall into- the
hands of the Americans, but the Span
iards Insist the war will rage as long
as the rebels desire it. â¢
The correspondent at Manila of the
Correspondencia alleges that within six
days from the reopening of hostilities
the Americans lost 1000 men and that
several companies of troops fell into the
hands of the insurgents.
ANGELS CAMP
STAGE ROBBERS
PLEAD GUILTY
Murphy's Confession Results
in the Capture of His
Confederate.
SAN ANDREAS, March 25.â The out
law who was perhaps fatally wounded
by a bullet from Express Messenger
Jackson's rifle while attempting to rob
the Angels and Spring Valley stage
near AltaviHe last evening, has been
identified as Robert Murphy, who had
been employed on a nearby ranch as a
woodchopper. He made a statement
naming as his confederate Henry
Westhall was arrested at his cabin on
ployed with him and shared his cabin.
Westfall was arrested at his cabin on
the Selkirk property, fie appeared be
fore Justice Cooley this morning and
pleaded guilty to the complaint. Mur
phy the wounded man, was at the res
idence of William Brurcer and in a too
serious condition to be removed. H:s
preliminary hearing was held at that
place and he" sullenly pleaded guilty.
Murphy was seen by The Call cor
respondent, and appeared to be in a
very dejected mood. He said he was
19 years of age and hailed from Michi
gan. The town he would not name, as
he did not wish his folks to know of
his escapade. The plan to rob the stage,
he said, was concocted at his cabin
last evening. Westhall, he said, did the
talking when the stage was stopped.
Murphy said his shotgun, a single
barreled one, was loaded with number 4
shot. Asked if he knew messengers
were on the stage, he sarcastically re
plied that he guessed he ought to know.
Murphy does not bear the best - of
reputations. Last summer he stole a
watch from a man, but returned it
when promised there would be no Dro
secution. In January the wagon of a
peddler named Martin was robbed
while standing near the Selkirk resi
dence. To-day the stolen articles, con
sisting of clothing and neckties, were
found in Murphy's trunk.
WeEthall is about the same age as
Murphy, and is evidently one easily
led. He admitted complicity in the at
tempted holdup. Evidently he had lis
tened to Murphy's glowing accounts of
th*-" fruits of a holdup and acted with
him while under his influence. He car
ried a 3S-cal!ber Colt's rifle, which he
had borrowed from Walter Bidwell
previously for the purpose, he said, of
killing a cow which had fallen into a
hole and could not get out. His father
was committed to an insane asylum
last year. He has a sister who lives at
Murphys. thi? county. Undoubtedly
Westhalls mind is not strong.
Murphy is in a serious condition, the
ball striking the small of the back on
the left side and coming out' in front of
the body. The ball dropped to the
floor in iveor pieces when his clothing
was removed.
Both, men were bound over to ap
pear before the Superior Court.

FDeclaJ Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 25.â An im
portant confidential official communi
cation to Aguinaldo from one of his
leaders is among the captured docu
ments from the Philippines which have
been forwarded to Acting Postmaster
General Heath. The document is
marked "most urgent," and addressed
to "Senor Don Fmilio Aguinaldo, Presi
dent of the Philippine republic, Ma
lolos."
It is signed by Bonafaoio Arevalo.
who appears to have been one of Aguin
aldo's trusted agents in Pasig. near
Manila. The handwriting of the letter
i 6 fairly pood, but the spelling: and
punctuation are so illiterate that the
most expert' Spanish translators have
not been able to make a verbatim
translation. The general purpose of
the letter, however, is clearly apparent
and confirms previous information that
a general uprising of Aguinaldo's ad
herents in and around Manila was in
contemplation some time about the end
of January or the beginning of Feb
ruary last. The writer says that he has
2000 men available who will rise at the
hour fixed for the "rupture." He has
cautioned them, he says, that on the
day determined on they must keep in
their houses until night, so as not to
attract the suspicions of the Ameri
cans.
'I am in Pasig." he says, "so as to
be ready at any moment to go to my
district of Sampaloc." He says he has
been warned by a friend who professed
to speak in the name of Major Bell (an
American officer, since reported
wounded) that he had better keep quiet
and stay at home, but that such advice
is repugnant to his feelings. He apolo
gizes for not having levied a prestamo
or forced loan on the citizens of Pasig
as ordered by Senor Sandico in the
name of Aguinaldo. saying that he
could not do so without drawing down
upon himself the attention of the
Americans, who were so numerous all
around him. He closes by an urgent
apÃeal to Aguinaldo to send money to
meet the immediate necessity of his
forces.
The letter is dated January 28, and
was intended to have been sent by
courier to Aguinaldo when intercepted.

o'clock they reached a place with a
clump of brush, a half mile this side of
Altaville. In front of the Keystone
mine two men stepped out and told the
driver, Frank Washburn, to stop.
When he drew rein Messenger McCon.
Nell brought up his gun to fire, but
Jackson said:
"Don't fire, Mac; those men want to
get on the stage. This is the place
where Lee Hendricks and another man
usually get on and ride to Altaville."
Jackson was coon undeceived, for
Outlaw Murphy ordered the driver to
throw out the treasure box. Washburn
reached for the box, but delayed for a
moment, waiting for the messengers to
shoot. McConnell pulled the trigger,
but the cap snapped. The impatient
robber exclaimed:
"Why in hâ l don't you throw the box
out?"
Then Jackson threw himself across
McConnell's knees. The curtains were
partly drawn on the stage and partly
obscured the messenger's view, so that
he could see only a portion of the rob
ber. He fired, but the bullet went
through the robber's hat. Murphy
started to run and Jackson fired again,
shooting him through the body. The
other outlaw was fifteen or twenty feet
behind the stage. He fired at Driver

whipped up the team, and it ran about
seventy-five yards. He then stopped to
see if any one was hurt before proceed

were two passengers on the stage, one

The messengers thought they had

and asked for assistance.
FREE SILVER NOT
THE GREAT ISSUE
Oliver Belmont Advises
Democrats.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 25.â The Herald
will print to-morrow a letter from
Oliver H. P. Belmont, in which he calls
on the Democrats to harmonize their
differences and, close the ranks for the
battle of 1900. He says:
Speaking for myself, I am a gold man,
hut I will unhesitatingly support free
' silver, 16 to 1, should it be made the plat
| form sentiment of the party in 1900. I
1 will give my full support to any candi
date whom the convention selects.
However, I do not regard the question
of finance a-s of primary importance at
any time. It will grow steadily less im-
I portant between now and next election.
I Some suggestion of the truth of this can
i be found by comparing last fall's elec
tions, State by State, with those of 18!*>.
It is not to be denied fhat general in
terest In finance as a question Is falling
away.
Then* is no such general strong silver
demand as there was three years ago.
I That, no doubt, is due. to a condition of
better general business and easier times.
I For myself. I say again, I do not fear sil-
I ver. We have had silver coinage before
'< and succeeded, just as we have had a sin
j gle gold standard now and succeeded. We
i will not meet wreck if we have silver any
I more than ruin is to overtake us under
the single gold standard.
The trusts form the giant evil, imminent
and threatening, in our affairs. There is
no time or room for details here. But
the monster combination of money, called
j the trusts, whose methods contemplate
the bribery of Congresses and Legisla
tures and even the control of courts, must
be destroyed. To this we should have an
income tax and an inheritance tax. We
: should have public ownership of all these
franchises which are now in the hands of
the great railroads, bridge and electrical
companies and all other combinations of
kindred sort. Above all. we should have
the initiative and referendum, and so put
within the actual power of the people at
the polls to propose or pass a law or, if
needs be. power to repeal a law in spite
of any action by venal or corrupt Con
gresses or Legislatures.
We shotild attack government by in
junction and the national bank system.
We should be for the election of Senators
and the United States Judges by tne
people. We should be for an increase in
the navy and against an increase in the
i army. We should be for economy and for
i the cutting down of expenses. We should
be against expansion and the seizing of
the Philippine Islands beyond such har
bors of islands as are necessary for naval
stations.
If we w^re to go in for all these mat
ters and add to them an attack on the
opposition for its rotten war record, for
its roguery of embalmed beef, for its
steals of contracts, there would be no
doubt of Democratic success.
Drought in New South Wales.

BOWLING GREEN, 0.. March 25.â
O. E. Westenhaver of North Baltimore,
one of the best known attorneys in this
county, was murdered at Hoytsville
shortly after noon to-day. He was
trying a case against Paul and John
Zeltner for attorney fees, and when
court adjourned at noon the brothers
demanded certain papers, which he re
fused to surrender. John Zeltner fired
at the attorney, who ran out of doors,
the ball striking Westenhaver in the
right side. Four more shots were fired
at him. but they did not take effect.
At the corner of the building Paul
Zeltner met him and fired two shots at
the attorney, one striking: the leg and
the other going into his forehead. Death
resulted in a few minutes.
COLUMBUS, 0., March 25.â A special
to the State Journal from Hoyts Cor
ner says: After the murder the Zelt
ners fled to their home, pursued by a
crowd of several hundred men. The
Zeltners stood "boldly in their yard all
the t>arly part of the afternoon and de
fied arrest. There was a frequent ex
change of shots between the fugitives
and the crowd at long range, and a
man named Wittenmyer, :\h<> crossed
an open space, was shot through the
heart and instantly killed.
Sheriff Kings Burns and. a po?se of
depuiles were soon on the scene, but
the fusillade of 'shots kept up by the
Zeltners prevented any effort being
made to capture them.
Deputy Sheriff Roach, who took re
fuge behind a tree in the woods, was
made a special target and three bul
lets grazed the tree behind which he
stood. Later in the day the Zeltners
retired within the house and barri
caded it. A hundred shots were firod
into the house, but without effect. The
Sheriff then decided to call for the
Bloomdale Rifles, and in the meantime
a guard was stationed axound the
house. Mrs. Zeltner and her three chil
dren took refuge in the cellar.
This evening a neighbor of the Zelt
ners went into the house under a flag
of truce and tried to Induce them to
surrender, but they declined to do so
before morning, fearing the mob.
Every effort is being made to prevent a
lynching. This will be difficult, in view
of the temper of the people, who are
incensed not only by the killing of
Westenhaver. but by the death of Wit
tenmyer, who is a respected citizen. The
Sheriff will appeal to the Governor for
sufficient force to protect the Zeltners
whon they ar.'' in custody.
The Zeltnerrt seem to have prepared
for the trouble, as they had sold their
farm and bought a large quantity of
ammunition enly yesterday.
SPANISH GJRL KILLED
BY AN AMERICAN SHELL
VICTORIA, B. C, March 25.â A letter
to the China Daily Mail, copies of
which were received to-day by the
steamer Tacoma, describes the terrible
death of a young Spanish girl' named
Engracia Dies daring the boTibard
ment of Iloilo by the American war
ships. One of the shells from the bom
barding squadron struck the house
â where the unfortunate young woman
resided with her mother, and, penetrat
ing the walls, severed the girl's head
from her shoulders. The mother, with
a terrible shriek, threw herself upon the
headless body and was not found un
til some hours afterward, when some
American soldiers, who were looking
through the city they had just bom
barded, broke in upon the horrible
scene.
On the following day the American
soldiers buried the body with full mil
itary honors. The headless trunk was
placed in a beautiful casket made by
the soldiers and mounted on a gun car
riage. Covered with "Old Glory," the
remains of the innocent victim of the
bombardment were drawn In silence to
the graveyard just beyond the city
wall. Thus, the only Spaniard buried
with honors by the Americans during
the war was interred.
The girl was said to have been very
handsome. She was but IS years of
age. Her mother, in addition to this

BRITAIN AND FRANCE
LONDON, March 25.â A red-letter
page in the history of Africa was
turned this week when Great
Britain and France came to an
agreement in parceling out the '
last portion of Africa still open to
"grabbers." The agreement reached !
disposes of hundreds of thousands of !
Bquare miles, leaving only four recog- j
nlzed independent states throughout ;
mtinent â Morocco, Abyssinia, Li- |
beria and the Orange Free State. The
settlement has given satisfaction in
Great Britain, where it* is generally
considered fair for both parties and as
having especial value in finally avert
ing, as far as diplomatics documents
can, future disputes. Moreover, an |
important feature of the agreement
providing equality in the commercial
treatment of the territory between
Lake Tchad and the Nile is that it does
not hamper Great Britain in the least,
as her free trade system would have
secured the commercial rights of
France, while the French concession of
equal rights improves the English po
sition. In the face of French colonial
protection this is a most valuable ad
vantage for Great Britain, which is
fully appreciated here.
The reception of the agreement by
Europe Is decidedly favorable. ' The
Russians do not seem to care, the Ger
mans apparently hope for compensa
tion elsewhere and are not sorry to see
France's hands full of colonial em
barrassments, while in France, except i
for colonial faddists and inveterate ;
Anglophones, the majority are dazzled j
by the empire secured to them, which j
they picture to themselves as a second i
India, and they also heave a sigh of !
relief at the fact that the matter has
finally been adjusted.
As the Spectator remarks: "Only
French Anglophones are discontented,
and they can only complain that the j
English have given away what they !
do not possess. This criticism is quite \
true, but Europe has been doing that |
in Africa for twenty years, and is go
ing to do the same in China. If j
Europe and America have not a grad- 1
ual suzerainty over the world all their j
proceedings are a huge Dacoitry; but
then they affirm, and. when necessary,
enforce their suzerainty."
The French Government is carrying j
the Mil to a ratification, and it is ex- j
pected that it will be voted on by the I
Chamber of Deputies on Monday. M. j
Del Casse. the French Minister of
Foreign Affairs, counts on a good ma- ;
jority.
One good result of the agreement is j
seen in the announcement published in ;
the Echo de Paris to-day of the sus- j
pension of a military defense for the
the defense of Corsica. Algeria and
Tunis, and the return of the troops re- j
cently sent to Algeria and Tunis and I
the coast towns of France, owing to
the tension of the Anglo-French rela
tions.
Soudanese experts predict that the j
French will find they have a hornet's j
nest in the region around Lake Tchad, â 
where era] potentates hold sway.
The leading ruler is Raheh, formerly
a slave in Upper Egypt, who went
westward and carved an empire for
himself with his sword. He is now \
styled the "African Napoleon," has an '
army of 40,000 men, and rules the ter
ritory southwest of Lake Tchad He J
is at* loggerheads with the neighboring
Sultan of Wadai, whose country is In- |
eluded in the French sphere, and who
has nearly 3.000,000 followers among,
the Senoussi. and whose - troops are j
said to be led by Europeans. France's
policy is to foster the mutual hatreds
between Raheh and Wadai, but, if this
leads to an attempt to subdue either of :
them, she will have a tremendous j
struggle before her. and especially in
the case of Wadai, as thousands of j
Senoussi live in Tunis and Algeria, and
would probably take common- cause
with their coreligionists in Wadai, in- I
volving a conflagration in France's j
North African possessions.
Slatin Pasha. In an interview, is
quoted as saying: "France's conquest
of her new protectorate will be very !
difficult and will entail many* sacri
fices." ___

TALK OF INVASION
OF GREAT BRITAIN
Parisiao Writer Tells How FraQce
Could Send a Big fJrmy io
PiQQaces.
LONDON, March 25.â 1n spite of the signing of the Anglo-French
agreement regarding Africa, one of the leading topics of the week both
sides of the channel has been an article published in the Revue dcs Deux
Mondes seriously outlining a fresh scheme for the invasion of Great
Britain. It proposes that 1500 steam pinnaces be built and collected
in the canals and rivers leading to the French coast, that each of them
be armed with two quick-firing guns and that they convoy an army of
170,000 men and 500 cannon, with the necesary ammunition, stores, etc.
The cost of their construction is estimated at 150,000.000 francs, and
the pinnaces are to be provided with torpedoes to keep off hostile ships,
while the quick-firing guns are to repulse torpedo-boat attacks. The
writer of the article says there will be no difficulty in getting the boats
across, pointing out that Napoleon had a far more difficult task at
"Wagram, where he crossed the Danube in the face of an Austrian
army. The English coast defenses are classed as being a negligible
quantity, and the operation is counted on by the writer as being merely
a matter of a few hours. Three divisions of 14.500 men each are to be
landed in Ireland, and the Irish are to be armed with the old Gras rifles.
The English papers poohpooh the scheme, but the French newspa
pers discuss it as being a perfectly sound proposition. The Petit Jour
nal praises the plan, declaring its chief merit is in its simplicity and
unity, and points to the success of the Roman, Saxon, Danish and
Norman invasions as proving the feasibility of the project.

BERLIN. March 25. â Xo sooner hart th*Â»
first terrible card scandal begun to fade
from memory than we have another.
This time the scene was the Turf Club,
where one of the best known members
has for sonv> tirri past been netting large
winnings by m^nns of cheating- Up is
credited with having won 350,000 marks.
Rather than have a scandal the members
made the offender resign, and he has
gone to the I'nited Statin.
The truth is that all the clubs In Ber
lin, with the exception of the Military
Club, in which th^ Kaiser forbade uam
bling. are run merely for the purpo
play. T'pon It they exist. It is perl
useless for his Majesty to prohibit play
in thi> Military Club if it is tolerated in
all other clubs, good and bad alike, in
which officers are heartily welcome.
These clubs, even if swindlors could not
gain admission, are a curse to Berlin.
THE SAN FTJANCISCO CALIi, SUNDAY, MARCH 26, 1899.
CAMBRIDGE BOYS
DEFEAT OXFORD
Easily Win the Annual
Boat Race.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PUTNEY. England, March 25.â The
fifty-sixth annual boat race between
crews representing the Universities of
Oxford and Cambridge was rowed to
day over the usual course, from Putney
to Mortlake. a distance of about four
and a quarter miles, and was won by
Cambridge. for the first time in ten
years.
Cambridge now has twenty-four out
of the fifty-six races rowed to her
credit.
The light blues, as cabled yesterday,
were the favorites in the betting, the
odds then being 11 to 4 on Cambridge,
though this was regarded as extrava
gant. The crews were sent off at
12: Mp. m.
Cambridge, winning: the togs, took
the Surrey side of the river, which,
with a fresh wind blowing. " gave the
light blues a decided advantage.
Cambridge at once assumed a slight
lead, which it increased to one and a
quarter lengths at the Craven Steps,
about five furlongs from the start.
Just beyond that point, however.
Oxford bfgan drawing up, and at the
Crabtiee wharf, 1 mile 1 furlong and
100 yards from the starting point, was
level with Cambridge. The Crabtree
wharf was passed at 1:03.
At Hammersmith bridge, 1 mile 5
furlongs and 100 yards from the start
ing line, Cambridge had again assumed
the lead by half a length, which was
increased to two and a half lengths
at Thorneycroft, some three miles from
the start.
Thence Cambridge continued her po
sition, rowed a fine, steady stroke.
while Oxford splashed badly and was
evidently distressed.
When the light blues reached Barnes
bridge, 3 miles 4 furlongs and 30 yards
from the start, they were four lenghts
ahead, and the race was practically
over, for the Oxfords were going to
pieces and rowing unsteadily.
The Cambridge crew finished strong
four lengths ahead of Oxford. Two of
the Oxford cr<>\v fainted as their boat
crossed the line. The official time was
21 minutes 4 seconds.

of the Thistle.
The party consisted of William Ford,
his aged mother and two sisters, aged
18 and 15, and Mrs. Harry Thames, her
19-year-old daughter and three smaller
children. The ninth member of the
party is thought to have been the
daughter of a Comox farmer. Her
name has not been learned.
William Ford was the son of a
wealthy farmer of Honolulu, and. with
his mother was visiting her old home
stead. The remainder of the party
resided at Quolcum. The Thistle was
of only five tons register.
Owing to the number of inquiries
made it may be stated that the Thistle
is not the vessel belonging to the
Alaska Packers' Association, but hails
from Victoria, B. C.
PRINCE ARTHUR MUST
ACCEPT THE DUKEDOM
His Withdrawal From Eton Shows
That He Will Succeed to Saxe-

NEW YORK, March 25.â A special
cable to the Journal from London says:
The withdrawal of the young Prince
Arthur of Connaught from Eton be
fore the conclusion of the term clearly
foreshadows the fact that he is des
tined to be the heir of the Duke of
Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The result of
the family council at Cimiez, where the
Queen has consulted all three of her
sons, has evidently been the determina
tion that Prince Arthur shall not abdi
cate the succession in Gotha in favor
of the next in line, the delicate little
Duke of Albany.
Prince Arthur is a manly lad to the
backbone. He does not like giving up
his prospects of a military education
at Sandhurst and a commission in the
British army, of which his father is the
destined commander in chief, but the
regal necessities are paramount, and
the Queen is not likely to regard the

WASHINGTON, March 25.â The re

and the appointment of O. H. Curtis of
New York in his place at the instance of
Senator Platt is in no way looked upon
as a forerunner of further removals.
Troy being kept in office by Mr. White
was looked upon as likely to retire with
the California Senator. The fact that he
was paid JI9SO by a special appropriation
in the deficiency bill for â¢â services ren
dered on the floor of the Senate" was an
other reason why it was thought he could
be retired at this time. Thfs extra pay
was urged, it is understood, to make Mr.

at arms, he having been detailed from
duty during that period from the Secre

Three gaping wounds extended across
his throat, ar.d the windpipe was punc
tured.
Mitchell, who was 36 years of age,
was an Englishman, and lived on re
mittances sent from his relative?, who
reside near Leeds and are wealthy. His
brother, Cameron Mitchell, i? man
ager of a cattle ranch comprising 20.
--icres in Montell Canyon, sixty
miles west of Uvalde, Texas. On that
place the suicide spent of the
five years, having been sent there
by his family In th<Â± hope of changing
his methods of living.
Of fine appearance, well educated,
sauve in manner, with a gracious air,
he was murh sought by the social set
In San Antonio and other Texas cities.
In San Antonio he met Mrs. J. Martyn
Black, a sister of A. Frederick Schultz,
the son of the well-known English
powder manufacturer. Although Mrs.
Black was Mitchell's senior by ten
years and the mother of two children,
an attachment spraner up between the
two which led to their undoing, first
by the discovery of their illicit love by
Schultz, then their flight to Los An
geles six weeks ago and the suicide of
both within three days of each other.
The body of the woman lies at the
Long Beach undertaker's quarters
awaiting the disposition of the
brother, who will arrive to-morrow
morning. Among Mrs. Black's effects
are many diamonds of rare value, laces
and trinkets indicating the position she
occupied in social life.
Mitchell's family has been notified of
his death. An inquest will be held to
morrow. ___

Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, March 25.â Another bliz-
z ard has struck Colorado. From all over
the State come reports of snow and
cold weather. Here in Denver it has
been snowing and blowing since about
the middle of the afternoon. The 3torm

have been prevailing in this section for
the past few days have raised havoc
with the Rio Grande Railroad in the
' Black Canyon. The train from the
West, due here yesterday evening, en
i countered fourteen rock and snow slides
and it was 6 o'clock this morning before
I it got through the canyon and reached
'' Sapinero. From the latter place to
Gunnison it was supposed to be clear

1 this side of Sapinero was reached the
train ran into an immense rock slide.
: The engine was completely wrecked

The engineer and fireman both jumped
from the cab and were uninjured. None
|of the passengers were hurt. The mail

THE SAN FRANCISCO .CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 26, 1899.
ENGINEERING SKILL HAS
PREVENTED FLOODS ALONG
THE LOWER SACRAMENTO
Construction of an Easement Diverts Storm
Water Into the Yolo Basin and Insures
Against Breaks in Levees.
SACRAMENTO, March 25.â Chief
Engineer M. A. Nurse of the
Board of Public Works, and a
number of members of the
Auditing Board to-day visited
the levee, or easement, built in the
Sacramento River by the State last
summer. They were joined on the
ground by Public Works Commissioner
E. E. Leake, and together the party
went over the ground. The water was
found to be running over the easement,
carrying the storm water into the great
Yolo basin, thus protecting all down
river levees from any danger of
breaking. The easement was found to
be a perfect success, and few land
owners in the Lower Sacramento Val
ley realize what a splendid thing it is
for them.
Before this work was constructed
at every high water there were re
peated breaks in the levees at most un
fortunate places. As a result of these
breaks thousands of acres of valuable
land was flooded and crops ruined.
Before the breaks occurred the river
often ran bank full, and the islands in
the lower part of Sacramento County,
containing the fruit and vegetable land
In the State, were flooded. To-day's
test proved that this can never occur
in the future.
The easement is built of rock and
concrete, is 2000 feet long and 15 feet
across the top. Being eiprht feet lower
than the levees, which abut on either
end. water will begin flowing over the
easement before the river gets within
six feet of the danger point.
Of course the Board of Public Works
was anxious to see this splendid piece
of engineering construction tested,
and its wish was gratified to-day.
When the members reached the ease
ment they found an immense stream of
water. 2000 feet lung and a foot and a
half deep, flowing gently over the
crown of the concrete without waste to
the fields beyond into the great Yolo
basin.
By thus easing the Lower Sacra
mento there is no danger of future
floods and no danger that breaks will
appear in the levees below the point
where the levee is situated.
The heavy fall of rain within th<= past
few days has had the effect of swell
ing all the streams in this vicinity, and
the banks have given away on the
smaller rivers tributary to the S
mento, causing considerable overflow
in certain localities. The damage, how
ever, will prove slight and many farm
ers appear to be glad that their lands
have been overflowed.
Reports were received to-day of the
overflowing of the hop lands bordering
the American River, about five miles
BITTER COMPLAINT
OF THE GERMANS
Say No Reciprocity Is
Shown by America.
Copyrighted, 189?, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, March 25.â The German
newspapers, in discussing the commer
cial relations between Germany and
the United States, complain more or
less bitterly of the alleged fact that
while here everything is being done to
bring about an improvement, Germany
being willing to sacrifice something: to
that end, no reciprocity has been shown
by the United States, where, it is as
serted, even the calm and moderate
part of the press does not recommend
any steps in that direction. A score
of articles written in this tenor have
appeared in many of the papers. It
is believed that they were inspired by
the Government for a purpose. The
most plain-spoken article was pub
lished in the Cologne Volkszeitung.
which said that the Americans were
greatly mistaken if they imagined that
all the yielding in the efforts to arrange
a treaty would be done by Germany.
Andrew D. White, the United States
Embassador, referring to the Samoan
situation, made the following state
ment to the correspondent of the As
sociated Press:
'The negotiations between Germany
and the United States in regard to Sa
moa which have been partly carried on
here have ceased for the present, and
are now exclusively carried on at
Washington. Among the reasons for
this change is the one that as Wash
ington is nearer in point of time to the
scene of action there will be less delay
in obtaining information. This is the
present status.
"The negotiations in regard to the
commercial treaty are also confined to
Washington, where the bureaus of
John Kasson, special reciprocity com
missioner, and Baron yon Holleben, the.
German Embassador, are handling
them. lam not aware of any interest
ing recent developments in the matter."
Replying to a question as to whether
the- presence and doings in Germany of
Robert P. Porter have had any appre
ciable effect, good or bad, on the re
lations between Germany and the
United States, Mr. White said: "No; so
far as I can judge that has not been
the case."
The Reichstag has adjourned until
April 11. Since it convened it has ac
complished a great deal of work, hav
ing held sixty-one plenary and eleven
special sessions. The various commit
tees (here called commissions) have
also dispatched much business. Of the
bigger bills only the budget was finally
passed. The banking;, judiciary, lex
seinge, or the law against unnatural
crimes, and several other bills, are still
progressing. The postal, telephone,
telegraph and meat inspection bills
have not even had their first reading,
but these measures will come up after
the holidays in the order named.
Before adjourning the Reichstag had
a most exciting discussion on the sub
ject of gambling. Herr Bebel, the So
cialist leader, reiterated his charge
that there was a large percentage of
the army officers In the notorious
Harmlosen Club, adding that a similar
state of things prevailed at the Turf
Club, where heavy play is the main fea
ture. Herr Bebel further asserted
that many officers played there regu
larly In spite of the army regulations
forbiddinp gambling. He added that
among those who frequented the club
were three Princes of a reigning Ger
man house.
The Socialist leader then asked why
the Minister of War, General yon Ooss
ler, usually quick iD preventing papers
east of Sacramento. The bottom lands
on the ranches of Mayor William Land.
John Studarus Sr., a portion of the Earl
Fruit Company's property, Peter Hoey's
and Stephen Quail's ranches, all lo
cated In the neighborhood of Patter
sons Station, are more or less under
water. The bottom lands on the old
Rooney ranch, which, by the way, con
tains the largest hop field in the world,
and the bottom lands on the ranches of
William White, Antone Menk<2 and
Daniel McCarty are inundated.
Said R. D. Stephens, the well-known
fruit shipper, whose land is near the
submerged fields, to The Call corre
spondent this evening:
"It is a mistake to say that this over
flowing of the bottom lands is going to
work an injury to the orchardists and
hop growers. On the contrary, it will
work a distinct benefit. The water holds
a fine sediment, which is deposited on
the bottom lands and enriches it to a
remarkable degree. In fact, some of
the farmers have been hoping for twen
ty-five years that their lands would be
overflowed in this manner. Of course,
if the water remained on the land a
great length of time the effect would
be bad, but you will find that the water
will soon disappear and that the deposit
of sediment it has left will be of great
value to the lands."
It is of interest as showing the tre
mendous force of the current of the
Sacramento to know that the water
which has covered the bottom lands
along the American River is backwater
from the mouth of the American at its
junction with the Sacramento. The
Sacramento i? flowing so fast past the
mouth of the American that the latter
cannot empty its volume into it, and
so the water actually runs hack six or
seven miles to the bottom lands desig
nated.
On the Cosumnes, also, the water has
attained a great height and the banks
have broken in several places, over
flowing lands in the south western part
of the county. The Sacramento River
is five or six feet below the leveos and
there is absolutely no alarm felt any
where along the river. In fact, the
high water is quite generally regarded
as of vast benefit to the grainflelds and
orchards.
Buildings Carried Away.
REDDING, March 25.â Reports from
the East Side, in the track of yesterday's
extraordinary rainstorm show that a
great deal of damage was done. Four
familiea returning from a funeral at Mill
Valley were compelled to camp out all
night on account of high water in a creek
that is ordinarily dry. A dwelling house
and a blacksmith shop were carried down
the stream. A mile over Bella Vista the
storm increased in fury. A river of flood
water ran across the open, carrying away
a barn filled with hay and farming im
p!t m*-nt.Â«. Two wagons went down
stream and a large vineyard was up
rooted and ruined. Fencing in all dl
from speaking disrespectfully of the
army, had not proceeded against the
Tageblatt, which had given details in
connection with these clubs severely re
flecting on army officers. To this query
the Minister made an evasive reply.
Herr Bebel, continuing, said that the
extent to which gambling flourished in
the Turf Club was proved by the fact
that the club last year received 350,000
marks from .card money.
An investigation made by the corre
spondent here of the Associated Press
has more than corroborated the above
statements. It seems that 50 per cent
of the membership of the club consisted
of officers belonging to the active and
reserve forces of the army and that
the frequenters of the club until recent
ly included Emperor William's brother
in-law. Duke Ernest Gunther of Schles
wig-Holstein, three Baden Princes, a
Wurtemburg Prince, a Prince of Thurn
and Taxis and a number of the mem
bers of the Prussian Herrenhaus, Diet
and Reichstag. Any number of scan
dals have occurred in the club recently.
In the Prussian Herrenhaus there was
a hot debate introduced by two Yonkers
for the purpose of forbidding persons of
both sexes under 18 years of age visit
ing dram shops or leaving their native
place without permission and relntro
ducing punishment by whipping.
This feature of the bill has been re
ferred to a committee and will probably
pass. It Is claimed that most of those
who were consulted as to the advisa
bility of reintroducing whipping had
agreed that it was necessary, and
added that it seemed in most cases to
be more humane and more wholesome
than imprisonment.
YOUNG PICO ARRAIGNED
FOR HORSE STEALING
Nephew of the Former Governor of
California on Trial at Los
AngeleÃ.
LOS ANGELES, March 25.â The trial of
Alvino Pico, charged with horspstoniing.
proceeded this morning before Judge
Smith and a jury. The defense of Insanity
Is being attempted by the prisoner.
Pico is a nephew of ex-Governor Pit)
Pico, one of the notable characters In
California history. He Is charged with the
theft of a horse and buggy. It is alleged
Pico took the rig- to a livery stable and
left it, first selling a harness and robe.
The Countess Pico Gottliebson, the wife
of a Danish nobleman, now living in San
Francisco, a sister of the prisoner, testi
fied that his mind had always been weak
and that In his youth he had frequently
given signa of insanity. Cross-examina
tion developed that the Countess has not
been intimately acquainted with her
brother since 1879, for the reason that
since that year he spent most of his time
in Utah, Nevada and California State*
prisons. Count Gottliebson, a portly per
son with a Russian beard, was present at
the trial.
OPENED THE WRONG GRAVE.
WOODLAND. March 25.â Two Chinese
have been arrested in Davisville for body
snatching, and District Attorney Bush
went to that place this afternoon to make
a thorough investigation. The Chinese live
in San Francisco and arrived in Davlsvile
on Friday to obtain the body of a fellow
countryman 'who met death on W. W.
Montgomery's farm about ten years ago
and was buried in the Davisville ceme
tery. In the evening they proceeded to
the cemetery and dug several holes in an
attempt to locate the Chinaman's re
mains. They finally found a body, which
they removed and put into a box.
Some one passing the cemetery noticed
the Chinese digging into the graves and
notified the officers at Davisville. Upon
investigation it was learned that the
Mongolians had disinterred the n.-mains
of an Indian who had been dead about
fifteen years. The remains were identified
by several old residents of Davisville. The
Chinese were then placed under arrest.
It is not believed that they intended to
molest any other grave than that of their
countryman, but they had no authority
to open any grave, and will have to ans
wer to the courts for the offense.

Woodbridge in Danger.
LODI. March 25.â There is grave danger
of a flood along Mokelumne River and
the tule region west of here. The river i
to-night was rising at the rate of two j
inches an hour at Woodbridgre. That place |
is much lower than the river, and if the
levee breaks the town will suffer. Men i
are out watching the levee for miles
along the river.
Santa Cruz in Darkness.
SANTA CRUZ, March 25.â Trains are
again running on schedule time. Owing
to the damage to the flume of the Big
Creek Company the city has been without
Incandescent lights for several nights. To
add to the darkness the gas supply was
cut off last night, as a tree fell against
the boiler at the gas house, destroying
connections.
In Santa Ynez Valley.
LOS OLIVOS, March 25.â Santa Ynez
Valley is receiving the greatest drench

RHODES' MISSION
NOT A SUCCESS
Germany Will Not Fi
nance His Railroad.
BERLIN, March 25.â The result of
| Cecil Rhodes' mission to this country
: is generally spoken of by the press as
; equivalent to a failure. The financial
papers laugh at the idea that the Gov
ernment will furnish guarantees of the
' financial success of that part of the
projected Cape to Cairo railroad which
( is to pass through German East Africa.
Respecting the reasons which pre
vented the Emperor from dissolving the
Reichstag, it now appears that the
whole Bundesrath, Prussia alone ex
| cepted. was against him. Not only the
King of Saxony, but a number of other
sovereigns personally advised his Ma
j jesty against a dissolution, and if the
j Emperor had insisted, in the Bundes
! rath, in putting the motion for a dis
solution it would have been overwhelm
ingly defeated.
The Bundesrath to-day accepted the
Reichstag form of the military bill.
There is a strongly growing senti
ment in favor of excluding foreiern
â¢ born Princes from succession to Ger
i man thrones. The death of the heredi
j tary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha
I and the question of the succession to
the throne of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha
have started a discussion which has
! taken a violent form in some of the
papers.
The Munich Neuste Xachrichten
takes vigorous exception to the fact
that the succession was decided by a
family council of English-speaking
Princes presided over by Queen Vic
toria, and says:
"It is Intolerable that such a deci
sion should be made by Englishmen.
We do not blame the English branch
of the Coburgs for having turned en
tirely English, nor do we blame young
Connaught. He may be the nicest fel
low in the world; but It remains that
an Englishman is out of place on a
German throne."
The paper then advocates passing a
law regulating the succession to Ger
man thrones in a way to forever ex
clude all family rights of succession
held by foreign-born persons.
This is by no means the most vio
lent expression of opinion. Even some
of the newspapers close to the Govern
ment spoke in a similar sense, but with
more caution.
A member of the Bundesrath Informs
the correspondent of the Associated
Press that the Bundesrath has often
discussed the matter during the oast
month, and that while nobody thinks
of excluding the present heir to the
throne of Coburg, some new legislation
on the subject will shortly be proposed
in the Bundesrath jointly by the Ger
man governments and that later it will
be sent to the Reichstag.
The Alle Deutsche Blaetter, in a
flaming article, deplores the fact that
so many Germans fought on sea and
land under the Yankee flag in the late
war, and says America's young colon
ial empire "will be paid for with Ger
man blood, just as the French con
quered in the same way Tonquin, Mad
agascar and Dahomey." It adds: "If
the Yankees, with their coarse brag
ging, threaten to lick us, it is only be
cause they know their own skins are
safe is> my case. With their dollars
they would find enough German asses
and renegades to fight their own moth
erland."

FEAST OF PASSOVER
IS BEING OBSERVED
COMMEMORATIVE OF EXODUS
FROM EGYPT.
The observance of the Feast of the
j Passover began in Jewish circles last
i night. It will continue for seven days,
'< ending Saturday, April 1. The occasion is
' the 3238 th anniversary of the Israelites'
â  exodus from Egypt, 2339 B. C. The oom
i memoration is in accordance with Exo
dus xli. 18-20 . , .
The feast as it Is celebrated to-day, is
â¢symbolical of the fact that God ordained
man to be free in body and free in soul.
It offers a warning to all tyrants and op
i pressora that God will break their power.
Practically the nrst day and night only
compose the Feast of the Passover, lhe
remainder of the week is observed as the
feast of unleavened bread.
Before the festival began last night
each Jewish home was cleared of leav
ened bread. The firstborn son of each
family fasted yesterday to commemorate
the miraculous escape of the Israeli tish
firstborn from the tenth Egyptian
' plague. In each household there was
I solemn prayer and praise and reading of
the narrative of the exodus. The fami
lies then seated themselves around a
table whereon was spread the memorial
of the paschal lamb, the unleavened
bread and bitter herbs. All sat as equals
âparents and children, master and ser
vant host and guest. During the week
nothing but unleavened bread will be
taten.
The orthodox Hebrews meet in the syn
agogue each night and morning to praise
God for his mercies. On the seventh day
the narrative of the wonderful passage
over the Red Sea will be recited and the
"Song of Moses'" sung in the language
used by the patriarchs when they had
! journeyed through the bed of the mighty
waters to escape the ruthless sword of
Pharaoh. .
The first two and last days of the week
are holidays; the intermediate four are
but semi-holidays.
DID NOT DISCUSS GAS.
i Supervisors Postpone Consideration
of Figures Relating to a Munic
ipal Lighting Plant.
The Supervisors are not ready to pass
upon the question of a municipal plant
| for the lighting of streets and public
i buildings. Engineer Hunt was present at
j a meeting of the Street Light Committee
i yesterday, but was not heard regarding
I the figures he submitted last Monday.
His report has been printed and copies
were distributed among the Supervisors
yesterday. As they had no time In which
i to absorb his figures the matter was laid
over one week.
Chairman Kalben questioned Mr. Hunt
in a manner that indicated he had a
grievance. He asked him if he was em
ployed at present. Mr. Hunt replied he
was: that he was installing an electric
plant at Yuba. "You did not have charge
of lighting the Pavilion for the fight last
night, did you?" asked Kalben.
Mr. Hunt denied any connection with
] the affair. "Well, T heard them calling
i for 'Jackson' and the electrician, and I
thought you might have had something
to do with it."
Representatives of the Gas Consumers*
Association were present to protest
against the removal of their gas govern
ors for regulating the quantity of gas
used in the City Hall. The Building Com
mittee gave the privilege to a rival com
pany. After some discussion the matter
was referred to the Building Committee
as the one properly having charge of
such matters.
In the Divorce Court.
James F. Dennan, a police officer, was
granted a divorce from Maggie Herman
yesterday on the ground of exreme cruel
ty. Suits for divorce have been filed by-
Carlos Moncisvaia against Manuela Mon
clsvais, for desertion; Roletta Stella Gus
sander against Fritz A. Gussander, for
cruelty, and Frances L. Kraus against
Bingham Kraus. for failure to provide.

Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899,
by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, March 25.â The French people have heard so much about
the mascots of various American regiments and ships during the war
that it would not be surprising if the example were followed here. At
any rate the officers of the Seventeenth Chasseurs have adopted an
eight-day-old baby found in a railway carriage at Rambouillet. From
pome points of view this is better than selecting a goat or pig for a
ma-scot. but it would be interesting to follow the history of this fllle dv
regiment before passing final Judgment.

Special Pldpatch to The Call.
NEW ORLEANS, March 25.â The
Crescent City Jockey Club's winter
meeting ended In a blaze of glory this
afternoon. Slightly cloudy weather
made it cooler and the track was fast.
A double bill was presented, the New
Orleans handicap and the Crescent City
Derby being its features. In the first
race Lady Ellerslie equaled the track
record for six furlongs, and in the New
Orleans handicap Al Fresco, cleverly
handled by Nutt, reduced the track
rd here a second.
The Derby was called at 4:15 p. m.
The Morris candidate, Kentucky Col
onel, was favorite at 4 to 5 in the open
betting and maintained his place and
price to the end, the public supporting
him heavily. King Barleycorn, at 2 to
1, was supported mainly by his owners,
while Elmer S and Hittick, who were
coupled in the straight and separated
In the place betting, were backed from
20 to 1 to 10 to 1. Some of the books
laid 12 to l on Elmer S a place.
In the parade to the post all of the
starters received warm applause. - The
start was prompt and" good. Elmer S
showing first. Littlefield took Kentucky
Colonel to the front at once and led past
the half. The colt then showed signs
of faltering and dropped rapidly back
to the rear of the bunch, where he
finished. There was no interference of
consequence and no accident. The colt
showed that he was but a sprinter and
disliked a route. Elmer S, which ran
surprisingly well, regained command
and led into the stretch. King Barley
corn who had been rated with extreme
cleverness by Willie Martin, came away
when ready and won as suited him,
lowering the track record for the dis
tance. â . ,
Al Fresco and Necedah were the win
ning favorites.
The stewards have made the suspen
sion of Jockey Coombs indefinite. The
boy was suspended for his ride on
Takanaasee on February 23. Results:

Feeding the Fire.
The most powerful engine must stop if
the fires are not fed. Man is the most won-
derful piece of machinery in the world, yet
no matter how strong and well-made his
bodily frame may be, if the fire of life
within him is not constantly fed his limbs
and muscles become powerless and useless.
The reason men become helpless and
diseased is because the food they eat,
â which is the fuel of life, is not properly
digested and appropriated by the stomach
and nutritive organs. It is not completely
transformed into the strength and working
power which is to man what steam is to
the engine. . .
That wonderful power-making Golden
Medical Discovery," invented by Dr. R. V.
Pierce chief consulting physician of the
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute, of
Buffalo, S. V., imbues the human diges-
tive juices and blood-making glands with
capacity to extract abundant nourishment
from the food. It builds up organic tissue,
nerve fiber, hard muscular flesh and work-
ing force. 'It gives a man steam.
What it did for Mr. F. S. Hughes of Junction.
Hunterdon Co , N. J.. is given in his own words.
He writes: "I received your kind letter, and
iv reply would say that mine was a bad case of
kidney and liver {rouble, and that six bottles of
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery and four
bottles oflittle ' Pellets ' effected a complete cure.
It is well known that almost every eugineer Jf
troubled more or less with kidney trouble, especi-
ally on our fast express trains. I run one hun-
dred and forty-four miles on these trains every
day in the week, and have had no return of the
trouble since taking the remedies, nearly tars*
years ago." ?"â¢':' .' "**â¢â¢
THREE POWERS
WORK IN ACCORD
Modification of the Ber
lin Treaty.
IT RELATES TO TAXATION
GERMANY ASSENTS TO THE
NEW PLAN.
But the Kingship of Samoa Is a
Question That Cannot Be Def
initely Settled for Some
Time.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. March 25.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent sends
the following: As showing that the
signatory powers to the Berlin treaty
are acting in harmony in the discus
sion of questions arising out of the
present Samoan situation, I learned to
day that an agreement has been
reached respecting a modification of
the treaty in regard to taxation, and
authority has been given for the
Municipal Council of Apia, with the ap
proval of the Chief Justice, to pass a
law imposing hard labor.
"While these two points are not in j
themselves important, an official with !
whom I talked told me that they
showed harmony between the three !
powers. Both propositions were adopted
on the suggestion of the United States,
the assent of Germany being presented !
to Secretary Hay to-day. This country i
suggested that the consent of two pow- \
ers would be sufficient, but in her re- 'â 
ply Germany expressly stipulates that ,
her agreement is made with the under- !
standing that her consent does not es- I
tablish a precedent for the solution of j
Samoan questions according to ma- j
jorities. By this action the German
Government prevents the United States
and Great Britain from uniting against .
German wishes to set up^iaiietoa Tanu [
as King.
The German Embassador on Thurs
day presented a note to the Secretary
of State, embodying his Government's
views on the duties of naval command
ers in Samoan waters. Some appr>-hÂ»-n
--sion was felt in Berlin that Rear Ad
miral Kautz might exceed his powers
and create new complications.
Germany is understood to be urging
that the Berlin treaty be adhered to
in the settlement of pending questions,
and as the United States and Great
Britain also wish a strict interpreta
tion of the treaty there should be no
trouble in reaching a satisfactory
agreement.
I understand the proposition made by
this Government respecting taxation
authorized the collection of taxes out
side as well as inside of the municipal
boundaries of Apia. The object >>f this
proposition, of course, is to increase
the revenues of the island in order that
the expenses of the signatory powers
may be reduced. Under the terms of
the treaty the Municipal Council is
authorized to inflict adequate pt-nalties
including imprisonment for violation of
the treaty, under the regulations of the
council, but by the agr>-i-nirnt of tho
powers hard labor is added to the sen
tence which it may in future impose.
It is no longer denied in official cir
cles that the kingship question is an
important one which was to be dis
cussed, as the Herald stated, by the
three consuls on board the flagship
Philadelphia, the only foreign warship
now in the harbor. While the authori
ties are hopeful that an agreement will
be reached it is regarded as extremely
doubtful that such will be the case, and
it is. to prevent the American com
mander from adopting thr> vif-w of the
British and American Consuls, in case
of failure to agree, that the German
Government desired the administration
to understand how it regarded the
proposition of the naval commander in
Samoan waters as determined by the
terms of the Berlin act.
The German Government feels that
Mataafa is overwhelmingly popular,
having been elected by a vote of six
times as gTeat as that received by
Tanu, and that as the purpose of the
act â was to give a popular government
to the natives t.hey should be allowed
to select their own King. On tire other
hand, the American and British gov
ernments claim that Mataafa is barred
by the Berlin act; that the decision of
the Chief Justice was proper, and that
they propo^j to stand by it. It is ex
pected that the matter will finally be
discussed directly by the three govern
ments. In the meantime nothing has
been done looking to the withdrawal of
Herr Rose or Chief Justice Chambers.

ing educator would consent to speak of
the work of his own university.
The speaker first called attention to
the friendly relations existing between
the two colleges, due to the fact that
both undertook their great work at
about the same time and that their
aims were similar. He pointed out the
advantages that both possessed in be
ing upon private foundations and free
from any responsibility to politicians.
State institutions, he claimed, were as
much a necessity as private ones, how
ever.
"They are," he said, "the two arms,
and with either gone education would
be lamed.
"It is a remarkable thing," he con
tinued, "that the newest two of the
great institutions of learning should be

opened as the present wave of higher
education began to spread over the
country. Now there are twice as many
students preparing for college as there
were ten years ago, and there is no
longer the absurd cry of 'too many in
stitutions.' This can never be, for it
is Impossible to have too many colleges
as long as they are properly equipped."
In speaking of the differences be
tween the two colleges. President Har
per called attention to Stanford's 8000
acres and Chicago's twenty-seven; to
our freedom and open air work and
their cramped quarters in a crowded
city. The greatest difference, he said,
was in Stanford having its benefactress
near the university and interested in
every detail of the work.
"Chicago," he said, "misses her great

friend, for he has visited her only one
day since his millions endowed- her.
Both are doing the same work, but they
believe in pursuing different methods."
In conclusion the noted teacher told
of the work Chicago University was
doing. He spoke of its labors along ex-
I tension lines, the extent nf which made
it necessary to have a separate faculty
to lecture throughout different States
and conduct educational work without
the college walls, making it possible
for those who were not fortunate
enough to go to college to acquire an
education. His college, he said, stood
for two other principlesâ the necessity
of assisting the weaker colleges to be
come strong, or, in other words, affilia
tion, instead of the exclusiveness of the
older Eastern universities, and the

economy of shortening the vacations.
In reference to the latter principle he
said:
"The long summer vacation is a dis
tinct injury, especially to children of
the public schools. Chicago believes it
is not reasonable to suppose students
and professors need sixteen weeks rest
out of the year. If the time is em
ployed by the students to earn money
for college or the professors to do in
dividual research work it is different.
If employed merely for rest it is ab
surd. Men who have the burdens of the
world on their shoulders do not need
so much time for idleness. Why should
healthy students waste so much time?"
He ended his talk by congratulating
Stanford on the fact that her average
student came to her from a home over

the Southern boy should go North, the
Eastern boy come West and the West
ern boy study in the East, if he would
be broadened, for. in his mind, there
was much in the story that tho narrow

was born in Boston and educated there,
obtaining a degree from Harvard and
settling in Massachusetts for life.
Dr. Harper's tribute to Dr. Jordan
was a glowing one. He said no act in
the history of education for the last
half-century was greater in strength
and nerve and result than that accom
plished by President Jordan at Stan
ford University.

THE FIRST DUTY_OF THE CITY.
A THOUSAND things in the way of improve
ment and reform await the action of the offi
cials or the citizens of San Francisco, and may
be permitted to wait for some time, but there is One
gto be done at onee â a better home and abiding
place must be prepared for the unfortunates who are
smitten with pestilential diseases.
5 of these dread pests are not criminals,
and yet the community for its own. protection im
prisons them in a hospital shut out from the world
at large. The very nature of their affliction deprives
them of the ordinary and fashionable ministrations
larity. They cannot be visited by the members
.vcr mission?, nor cheered by the consola
of friends or relatives. They are cut off from
the common intercourse of men, and in their isola
tion are speedily overlooked and almost forgotten.
Even the official world neglects them, and it would
that they nre out of the pale of humanity.
a imposed upon them is not in itself
wrong. It is necessary for the general good. Science
commends, law authorizes it, and religion approves
it. Nevertheless, science, law and religion alike de
mand that it should be accompanied by every alle
gation that civilization can provide. The home of
the unfortunates should be comfortable, it should be
clean, warm and suitable to the needs of the sick. It
something of brightness to lighten the
gloom of its halls and to relieve as far as possible
the depression that falls upon its inmates in their
loneli:
The building which San Francisco has provided for
the unfortunates is the very reverse of all â¢ that it
should be. It has not one redeeming quality. It is
hardly more than a shanty, and is a very dilapidated
shanty at that. A member of The Call staff who vis
ite.d the place reports that the walls are so insecure
have to be propped up to prevent them from fall
ing. The decayed rafters cannot hold the roof boards
and the shingles nailed upon them. The shingles are
swept off from time to time by the wind, and when
the rains come the water drips into almost every
apartment in the building.
The scenes described by our reporter need no
strong language to make them impressive to the un
derstanding. On beds upon which sick patients are
lying, to prevent the whole bed from being saturated
buckets have to be placed to catch the water as it
drips. In the dining-room the table has been
crowded to one corner to avoid the rain. Pools of
water lie upon the floors in bedrooms, dining
rooms and corridors. The whole place is in a state of
dilapidation and reeks with the foulness of decay
which the best efforts of the nurses and those in
charge are unable to overcome.
It is not worth while to say of -this that it is a dis
grace to the city. Any comment would but be a
waste of words. The only thing to say is that a new
home for pest-stricken patients must be provided at
once. The case appeals to municipal duty and to pri
vate charity, and before another Sunday dawns upon
us something should be undertaken to relieve the
sufferings of those who have so many claims upon
humanity.
THE PIPE OF DISCORD.
HpHE pipe of peace long ago won a place in his
tory. Now comes the pipe of discord, a per
son named Smith having smoked it in an Ore
gon sanctuary during service, and, having been
bounced therefrom, ultimately fetching up in the
Police Court. What his sentence will be the world
waits to hear.
Smith ought to have known better. If he went
to church in contemplation of ensconcing himself in
a pew and there enjoying a smoke he might at least
have paid to the place and occasion the tribute of a
new pipe and some rniid tobacco. But no. Smith had
the sort of pipe which encountered in the open air
jars the senses, which in a close room, reposing un
lighted in the pocket, is a thing of terror, but which
going full tilt makes strong men turn pale. Smith
was guiity of the further solecism of using a grade of
wft>d suspected of containing leather, wool, rubber â
in fact, almost anything but tobacco. Doubtless the
wretch also scratched a match on the seat of his pew.
We have no desire to interfere with the adminis
tration of justice in Oregon, or to advocate the
obliteration of Smith under a crushing penalty. We
merely suggest that even if he escape mundane pun
ishment, the man who smokes in church seems in a
fair way to get, ultimately, more smoking than he
likes. Perhaps his better nature can be appealed to
and the sinner induced to do his loafing in a tannery,
where his environment would match him, and there
unmolested run his little garbage crematory.
It seems that Bryan still has the privilege of dining
with one of the Belmonts, anyhow.
THE FATALITIES OF WflÃ.
AT the beginning of the Spanish war The Gall
roused attention to the need of Red Cross
work, not only for the battle-field and the suf
ferers in action at arms, but for those sickened with
the diseases of the camp. In that connection we said
the deaths by disease would be rive to every one in
battle.
The officials have compiled the casualties from the
outbreak of the war to the first of the current month.
In that time the army lost in battle and by wounds
472 men and the navy 18, making a total of 490. In
the same period the navy lost by disease 56 men and
the army 5277, a total of 5333. Nearly eleven men
lost their lives by disease to one lost by battle. This
is an unusually high percentage. An enlisted man
stands a better chance, by 11 to I, in battle than he
does from disease.
This is largely due to the scene of the. war being
in the tropics. All temperate zone nations that have
carried on war under a vertical sun have had the
same trying experience. In all ages the tropical cli
mate has been a powerful factor in equalizing the na
tives with a superior force and better equipments
composed of temperate zone soldiers.
This is the sorry part of the Philippine problem.
Since the fighting began the reports are generally
confined to casualties in battle, and the deaths by
disease are not transmitted, but it is highly probable
that the proportion of n to i will be maintained or
exceeded.
Before our land forces moved into the tropics
there was propagated a wrong idea about sanitary
conditions, due to the excellent health of the naval
forces. Dewey's men on shipboard in Manila Bay
were in constant good health, and people at home
jumped to the conclusion that the climate was whole
some. But on shipboard the diet and habits of the
men are under strict discipline and regulation. They
drink only distilled water. Their rations are under
rigid inspection. The preparation of their food is
excellent. Their personal cleanliness and immunity
from the filth accumulations of a camp are great
factors. All these things were not considered, and
even the medical officers of the army gave out re
assuring statements about the salubrity of the cli
mate. But experience has shown the difference be
tween ship and shore. On land the thirst of the men
is inordinate and is quenched with water that is filled
with germs of disease. Regulation of a soldier's diet
is not possible as in the case of the sailor's. Con
tact with the poison of tropical soil and exposure to tho
vertical rays of the sun are unavoidable, and no sani
tary precautions can overcome the natural condi
tions, which are fatal to our race, though the natives
withstand them without injury.
Some surprise has been expressed at the anxiety of
the parents and relatives of the First California Vol
unteers for their return from the Philippines. As
readers of the daily papers are aware, this has taken
the form of an organization of parents, which has
held meetings and formally requested the Govern
ment to release that regiment and send it home.
This feeling is due to the information written home
in private letters that are not published, which are
expressive of the miseries of that service.
While the fighting is on letters that tell of organ
ized or individual acts of heroism, or that give
opinions about the campaign, arc written and read
and published, and there is less information about
conditions that are not related to action in the field.
THE "COMPLETED" CITY HALL.
IT is reported that at the next meeting of the Board
of Supervisors the commission which for upward
of twenty years has been engaged in completing
the City Hall will turn it over to the Building Com
mittee. The architect of the commission is going to
make a report upon what it will cost to put the edi
fice in good condition, which includes the adding of
a wainscot of California marble to the main cor
ridors. When this report is presented Supervisor
Holland, as chairman of the Building Committee of
the Supervisors, will move to accept the City Hall
and thereafter responsibility for maintaining and
completing it will be transferred from the City Hall
Commission to the Board of Supervisors.
Early in January last the City Hall Commission
presented its final report and asked -the Supervisors
to take the municipal elephant off its hands, but the
latter declined to do so on the ground that the plumb
ing is in bad shape, that the iron cornices are falling
away, that many of the rooms are unfinished, and
that a great deal of money will have to be expended
before the building is completed. It seems, howeevr,
that the Supervisors have not been able to make
their point. The commissioners have no money with
which to comply with their demands, and it is a case
of either accepting the hall or leaving it without an
owner.
In connection with this matter it is interesting to !
refer to the historical data which appears in the final
report of the City Hall Commission.
The work of excavating for the structure began on
March 28, 1871. The cornerstone was laid on Feb
ruary 22, 1872, and the building was "completed" on
December 30, 1898. The original estimate of the cost i
was $1,500,000. The amount received from the sale I
of the City Hall lots, which it was thought would pay
for all the work, was $953,900. Up to December 30
last the edifice had cost $5,723,987. It is estimated
that it will take $100,000 more to "complete" it.
The total cost so far does not seem extravagant !
v.hen everything is considered in connection with the
City Hall. If we had a building constructed on a
modern plan and furnished with modern improve
ments, supplied with ventilating and heating sys
tems and with rooms adapted for conducting the pub
lic business, perhaps the people would have no
ground for complaint. But in place of a modern City
Hall we have a dark and dismal pile of masonry, un
healthy, cold, unsupplied with ventilation or artificial
heat, designed to exclude sunshine and air, and ar- i
chitecturally a horrible nightmare. Under the cir
cumstances the public has a right to begrudge the
money.
A FLOOD TIDE OF PROSPERITY.
NOW that abundant rains have fallen to assure
good crops and brisk business in the State for
the coming season, the people of California can
with full sympathy note the evidences of prosperity
that come to us from other parts of the Union. Nor
is there any lack of such evidences. They come to us
from every side and from almost every branch of in
dustry.
So notable, indeed, has become the upward ten
dency of all the great interests of the country that the
record of the facts by which the tendency manifests it
self has grown to be one of the conspicuous features
of the news of the day. In the Eastern States, where
the depression of the Democratic tariff days was more
acutely felt than here, there has been a particularly
marked improvement in trade and industry, and with
the increase in the profits of capitalists a proportion
ate increase in the wages of workingmen.
The current number of the American Economist
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. MARCH 26, 1899.
reviews the condition of manufacturing trades in the
Eastern States and notes a large number of instances
where wages have been increased, or notices given of
an increase to take place in the near future. A still
more comprehensive summary has been made for the
Southern Mississippi Valley States by the St. Louis
Globe-Democrat, and the showing there is not less
prosperous than that in the East.
In many of the instances cited the increase of wages
affects large numbers of workingmen. Thus it is re
ported from Boston that cotton mills representing
nearly half the spindles in New England will raise
wages on April 3 by an average of 11 per cent for all
grades of employes. These mills employ nearly 65,
--000 hands. Several of the largest iron and steel manu
facturers of Pennsylvania have raised wages 10 per
cent, and a single one of these, the Bessemer Furnace
Company, has 4000 employes on its payrolls. Similar
good reports are given from the manufacturing dis
tricts of New York, Ohio and West Virginia.
The review made by the Globe-Democrat shows
that since the enactment of the Dingley tariff there
have been established in Missouri new industries
representing aninvestment of $7,682,000 of capital,
employing 8002 persons and paying $3,710,000 an
nually in wages. In Illinois the new industries have
a capital of $2,821,000, employ 3053 persons and pay
$1,351,000 annually in wages. In Kansas $2,084,000
new capital has been invested, furnishing work to
2604 persons and ' paying annually $1,313,000 in
wages. In Texas the investments amount to $915,000.
the number of hands employed to 664, and the annual
wages to $360,000. . In Arkansas the new capital in
vested equals $1,279,000, persons employed 1213, and
wages $1,421,000 annually.
These statistics are very far from representing the
magnitude of the increase of industry and wages, but
they serve to show the tendency now prevailing from
New England to Texas. They attest the value of the
protective tariff to all parts of the Union and to all
classes of citizens. William McKinley has fully justi
fied the people who during the campaign of 1896
gave him the title, "The advance agent of prosper
ity." The flood tide of industrial activity and good
wages has fairly started in the East and is flowing
westward fast. Californians this season may expect
not only good crops but good prices. The outlook
shows something of promise to every hope of the in
dustrious.
EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.
THE Arena for March contains an able article
upon the plan of blacklisting adopted by rail
road corporations, and prominently mentions a
case recently decided by the Supreme Court of the
United States, in which the word "liberty" as used
in the fourteenth amendment to the constitution was
construed to include the right to earn a livelihood by
following any legal calling. It also fully refers to a
case lately tried in Chicago in which a former employe
ofthe Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company
had a verdict against that corporation for $21,660 33,
of which $1850 was for actual and $19,816 33 for ex
emplary or punitive damages, because during the
strike of the American Railroad Union in 1894 the
plaintiff, a freight conductor, had quit work and was
afterward discharged from the employment of the
Chicago Great Western through an agreement that
no striker should be employed unless he obtained
what is called a "clearance," that is, the written con
sent of the corporation the- service of which he had
abandoned.
It is satisfactory to note that on the question of
blacklisting, as in other directions, there is some
prospect of a return to equality before the law. Here
tofore there has been decided inconsistency in the
judgments of the courts upon controversies identical
in principle but affecting different interests or differ
ent classes of persons. On behalf of a Chinese laun
dtyman. deprived by an invalid municipal order of
the opportunity to follow his vocation, the late Judge
Lorenzo Sawyer of the United States Circuit Court
delivered an eloquent vindication of the divine in
junction that in the sweat of his face man should eat
bread. But when the Mussel Slough settlers formed
an association to protect themselves against the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company, which, by vir
tue of a local track from Goshen to Huron that hap
pened to be on the line on which the Southern Pacific
railroad ought to have been constructed, claimed
their farms under the grant from the United States, it
required a fearless jury to acquit them of a charge of
conspiracy, to which very severq penalties were at
tached. When the great strike of the American Rail
way Union occurred, that combination to paralyze the
railroad business of the country, which produced
much violence and caused severe commercial and
financial derangement, was justly held to be illegal,
and, for the protection of property and of good or
der, injunction after injunction was issued and en
forced. But for years the equally objectionable al
liance between the railroads to drive their former em
ployes to pauperism or crime by depriving them of
employment, unless they secured the written consent
of the corporations they had formerly served, was
permitted to stand without question.
It is idle to talk of equality before the law as a
birthright of American citizens, protected by the Fed
eral constitution, when the same fact is declared legal
in one case and illegal in another, when a railroad
combination to oppress labor is sustained and a labor
combination to assail capital is destroyed. There is
but one law in the United States for all. and every in
dication that inequalities in its administration are
being rectified is an additional evidence of the suffi
ciency of our institutions.
When the people of the South start out on a negro
hunt they may have some shadow of excuse not dis
cernible at this distance, but they ought not to say
that the negroes had deliberately planned the inaug
uration of a race war. That sort of a story might go
in the section which hunts colored men when 'pos
sums are out of season, but it doesn't go here. When
the negroes decide to indulge in suicide they will
doubtless choose some less distressing method. There
is an explanation due, of course, but when it. involves
that the negroes down there are all idiots, and the
white men elsewhere as markedly deficient, it is not
acceptable.
There is now a school furniture combination, and
if it can do a thing to the taxpayers of the community

Collector Jules Gamage of this city
recently drove over an old man and
killed him. The victim was an inof
fensive old man, too, and so far as re
corded did not owe Gamage a cent. One
of the pleasures of driving seems to
horsemen of a certain negative intelli
gence that of making pedestrians jump.
Probably the person at the reins does
not intend to kill anybody. He mere
ly garners joy from observing the nar
row escapes. When the pedestrian
fails to jump quickly enough or far
enough and dies in his tracks the
horseman, is temporarily disconcerted,
and this seems to be the measure of
his discomfort. It is time for an ex
ample to be made, and as raw material
for the manufacture of an example
Gamage is available and promising.
The owner of a horse, unable to con

offenders hanged for the first homicide,
but to be sentenced to a boxstall for
ten years or so, there to be fed on a
Whltehat McCarty ration of hay,
would not be too severe. There are bi
cycle riders, also, furtive, cunning and

cency and common sense, unbelled, un
lamped and unarrested, scorching
their way to a place where the scorch
ing business is supposed to have no in
termission, apparently eager to add to
the mortality list. They have not yet
scored a Gamage triumph, but with
cripples, children and nervous women
exposed to their high-geared assaults
soon or late they will.

Several kindly disposed people have
written to this department under the
impression that they were addressing
the Henry James who writes beautiful
books, in which he says nothing, but
says it so charmingly; who breaks into
the magazines, portrait and all, and
tries to be as English as his good fa
ther was Yankee. The announcement
must be made, and perhaps should be
made with regret, that there is a dis
tinction so wide I can see it myself.
The James I allude to is a literary
flower blooming jn the garden of
phrase. When a breeze of sentiment
strikes him he lets flutter a petal or
two. I never liked his work, save as
specimens of flawless shading, but it
suits many discriminating readers both
here and in the country of the author's
adoption. Few of them could give a
reason for it. On the contrary, the I
humble architect of this column never i
broke into any magazine and proba
bly could more easily break into a safe.
His portrait was never printed, in all
likelihood never will be, and I am
mighty certain never with his consent.
He never wrote a book, expects never
to, and couldn't get it printed if he did.
He is a plain newspaper man, writing
with only the merit of sincerity and
fully assured that nothing he pens will
be rememb/ered a day, and that he him
self would be forgotten in a week were
he to abandon present pursuits and en
ter upon some useful industry like the
digging of ditches. He understands,
furthermore, and so in modesty drops
the first person, that this is considera
ble space to devote to a matter not of
general interest. He merely desires to
square himself with the other Henry
James and state that the occasional
confusion in identities is without con
nivance on the part of this office. The
local man has no desire for credit for
the books and magazine articles of the
Londoner, and he doesn't propose that
the Londoner shall have credit for
roasting rogues, and telling people out
this way how to be goo*. Neverthe
less, it is the only name he has, and
when the Londoner conceives the name
to be overworked, he can take another,
for there will be no change at this end
of the line.

A thoughtful man, by name Henry
E. Allen, has written a pamphlet with j
the title "In Hell and the Way Out." j
That the people are in that unpleasant j
place, with greed fanning the coals, he
demonstrates clearly, but the way out
seems to me beset by impassable bar- j
riers. In other words, I agree that we '
are in hell, but think we are destined :
to stay there until the receptacle en- j
| gulfs t"he last of us, even to those now j
outside, and our after fate must for the
present be left to the prophets. There j
is not space here for an. analysis of j
the book. Evidently it is the work of ;
a person who has devoted, much time to ,
the study of social conditions. He per- j
ceives the ills, apparent to all; the
blight of monopoly spreading over the
land like a shadow of impending disas- 1
ter; the rearing of great fortunes which j
must come from the earnings of the ;
toiler, who meantime grows poorer and
more poor; the heartless task-masters
of the sweatshops â all these are among j
the conditions he mentions in terms I
more profuse than mine. He thinks i
selfishness the root sin. So it is; the
basis of all sin. Yet selfishness has al
ways been the rule of human action,
and always will be. There is no help \
for this save the making over of the
spiritual essAice of man to conform to
the spiritual essence which from the
Mount taught the lesson of love. How
hopeless this task! For hundreds of
years the church has formally sought {
to impress the lesson, and the church
to-day, while generally a moral in
fluence, cannot conquer even within
itself the traits the Master stamped
as base and wicked. Some of the rich
est men in the country, adding to their
store by unclean methods, by crushing i
rivals, by usury, by grinding the faces I
of the poor, by selling rotten beef for
pur soldiers, are pillars in the church, j
Yet did they live as they profess to
desire to live the would regard money
only as a means to aid them in doing
good. And the ministers go where sal
aries are highest. Were they not told
to take no thought for the morrow?
After all these centuries the root sin
has grown an'" flourished so that it in
vades the sanctuary as -well as the
mart. If to inaugurate material reform
selfishness must be banished the future
holds no glimmer of millennial dawn.
Chief among the cures advocated by
Mr. Allen is that of direct legislation.
As set forth by him it seems feasible; |
judged by reality it is a dream. Capital
has so long held sway that so far as
peaceful means are concerned it is in
vincible. Does legislation threaten it?
It buys a legislature. Would a just
construction of a statute be an injury?
It buys a court. Does a faithful public
official brave it? It casts him from
place and seats one of its own .creat- j
ures. Under the existing status thera
can be no enactment inimical to capital I
and at the same time effective, for it j
will be declared null. The fact might !
as well be acknowledged that capital is !
the ruler and labor the ruled, and that j
labor can t help it, for it is j*ust as j
selfish as capital and its individuals i
will never act in harmony nor invar- j
iably resist a bribe. I do not write
those things in the effort to say aught j
that is new, and yet in the beating of
old straw a sound grain may fall to the j
threshing floor. Where is a real remedy j
for potent evils such as mentioned? I
There is none. This nation will go its
course as other nations have done, and
at last, hell overflowing, there will be |
between the patricians of fortune and J
the plebeians of toil a crash more ter
rible than that marking the fall of
Rome. Then there will be chaos, grad- j
ually crystallizing into such relations ;
as now prevail, and in due season the j
same programme over again. There j
will ever be an earthly hell, simply new |

The subsequent career of the Caraanctie
has been uneventful., although she came
very near making history for the na\>
during her first commission. It was tne
practice to take her down the Mare Island
Strait in the morning and enter San Faiy
lo Bay for gun practice. The high bluff
at the lower end of the yard, opposite
the old Starrs Mills, presented a good tar
get for the two 15-inch smoothbores of the
Camanche and the shells buried in the
soft rock. One day. however, the eleva
tion of the guns was higher than usual
and a couple of the 400-pound empty shells
sailed over the bluff, landed on the slope
and rolled down in close proximity to the
nava! magazine. This put a stop to that
kind of target practice and the. two V>
inch guns of the Camanche have been
silent for over thirty-three years.

K. Belles and J. K. Bulger in suspending
for one year the license of M. J. Madsen,
navigating officer of the coasting steamer
Jewel, which was wrecked near Caspar on
January 13 of this year. Assistant En
gineer Home lost his life on that occa
sion. Madsen appealed from the decision
of the local inspectors and Captain Ber
mlngham has decided that Madsen got no
more than his deserts. In passing upon
the matter. Captain Bermineham says:
"The Government has. at vast labor and
expense, surveyed and charted this coast,
and the soundings {riven by the charts for
r are twenty fathoms of water
. half a mile of shore, which in
creases gradually to a depth of seventy
fathoms rive miles off shore. Hence a cast
of the l*>ad thereabout would have given
almost the exact distance of the
from the shore.
"If the appellant, when he wanted to en
below for the night, which was at tim^s
ry and all the time cloudy, had
his chief officer to us
lead and r. I g I the fhore thaTi
forty fathom? of water; when he came
on deck for a few minutes, at 2:30 a. m.
and found the light? of Fort Bragg and
the Caspar slab fire both in sight, which
he and Captain Clausen testified could
not be seen at one and the same time
within lets than five miles from th^
?horeâhad he then given the mate orders
to k^-ep both these lights in sight till day
light, or until he might he called, ho
would have performed his plain duty as a
Fkillfu! navigator. Such would have been
a definite and unmistakable order for the
-ip and would have
undoubtedly sav<=-d her from, destruction
and loss '.uring that night. He did
not do bo, v ;e matter of k^-pinp
his ship off shore entirely to the judgment
0 â  -
"No argument can be introduced to sus
tain such â  the part of the ma?
ter. To my mind it cannot be justified by
any system of reasoning. So many steam
ers have been K>pt Â°n this coast by the
failure to get a casting Of their leads
that the many punishments which
been justly m^t^d out by the local board
should boa sufficient warning to others.
This did Hot seem to be a warning to the
appellant. Hence 4he judgment of the
lower court in this case must stand, and
it is so ordered."

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
DR. PIERCE,
frtmt a Pkatfraph. Inventor.
OUR NEW ESTABLISHMENT.
We hope our old friends and customers will make
a note 01 our change of address, and, when visiting
San Francisco, favor us with a call.
After being established at the corner of Sacramento
and Kearny streets for over 20 years, we realized that
the active, business portion of the city had changed
to other parts and that, in consequence, we had, as
it were, become side-tracked.
Anyone at all acquainted with the city will at once
recognize the fact that, in removing to our present
location, we have secured the bat and most central to
be found in the city of San Francisco.
The number, 620 Market street, is directly opposite
the Paiaee Hotel, and, as we occupy the entire second
and tftird floors of the building aforesaid, no one will
have the slightest trouble in finding the place.
THOUSANDS OF CURES.
Bvidecce of the wonderful curative power of Dr.
Pierces famous Electric Belts and Trusses continues
to arrive from all parts of the country. The follow-
ing selections are made from a large number of simi-
lar letters recently received at our San Francisco
office. Thus from year to year the evidence accumu-
lates and the lonr list of those who have been cured
of weakness and disease by means of the^-e celebrated
electrical appliances continues to increase.
It is true that there are other trusses and belts â
so-called "Electric," â offered for sale in various
parts of the country, some very cheap, and some very
expensive ; but, briefly stated, the fact remains now
as it has during the past twenty years : if you want
the BEST, you must have "Dr. Pierce' "
be* â ~- ,/ >Â»oman suffering from Rupture or from
any chronic weakness or disease should hesitate in sending
for the Truss or Belt required for its relief. Don't
wait until your complaint becomes incurable,

Dr. Piert* *â¢ Sen â
anrroiui : â Last October, while la garrison at Fort Bliss,
SI Paso, Texas, I sent for one of your famous Dr. Pierces Elec-
tric Belts for Rheumatism, etc., and after wearing it only about
two months, my complaints entirely disappeared, and I have
not been troubled with any pain or discomfort since.
I consider your Belt to be the finest Electric Body-battery in
existence, as the current it /ounrful and lasting. I purchased one
of your No. XXX Belts, and after using it several months it is
still as good as new.
I heartily recommend " Dr. Pierces Electric Belt " to all auf-
ferers. "â¢

back as I can remember. At the age of m years I commenced
wearing one of your trusses. Wore it twelve months and laid
it aside and have net had a truss en since.
It has now been thirteen years since I laid your truss aside. I
have rolled logs and done all kinds of farm labor, and my rup-

A CURE BY DR. PIERCE'STRUSS ISA PERMANENT CURE.
Cash's Dwot, South Carolina, March 18th, 1898.
Drs. Pierce if Son, San Francisco, CoJ. â
Dear Doctors : â "Will you please send me your latest pam-
phlet on Rupture with present prices of your wonderful " Mag*
netic Elastic Truss." By referring to your books you will see
that lam an old customer of yours. In the Fall of ISS6 I pur-
chased one of your tresses for a very large, right-side Scrotal
Rupture, which had been present from my infancy, and I was
so years old at the time I bought the truss from you, and the "
protrusion larger than a man 1 Jut. It never came down fully
after I put your Truss on, and I have had no return of the Rup-
ture on my right side in ten (10) years. When I think of how I
suffered before, I always feel grateful to you. I have received
many letters of inquiry about your Truss and have always
advised the parties to use it The reason why I write to you is
that since I was cured of the bad rupture on my right side I
have discovered a small rupture in my U/i groin ; the protru-
sion is small, but is very painful when out. â¢â¢â¦â¢â¦â¢
I am wearing one of my old trusses for it now un*C I can hear
from you. Hoping to hear ham â â¢ou soon, I am.
Yours gratefully, W. J. BROWN.

Dr. Pure* A* Son â
GÂ«stleÂ«s:-I desire to Inform you that the Magnetic
Elastic Truss which I bought front you about six months ago
has already accomplished wonders. I cannot praise it up too
much.
My Rupture is now almost entirely htaJed and I can take off the
truss without any rupture showing itself.
Your truss has done just what you said it would do when you
fitted it to me, and I shall always remain thankful that I
obtained Dr. Pierces Truss when I did. I heartily recommend
it to everybody.

NEARLY SO YEARS OF AOEI CURED I
HAitsnviM.a, Ouooi, January 7th, 1898.
Dr. Pitrct A* Sen, Smm Francisco, Col. : â
Dkai Siss : â I believe it to be my duty to suffering man- ,
kind to state the fact that I have been cured af Rupturx by your
wonderful Magnetic Truss. Before I got your truss I had suf-
fered a great deal with my Rupture and with wearing the old
iron hoop trusses, which I had to wear, but after putting your
truss on I found immediate relief from pain ; la fact, I might
say your Truss is almost "self-adjusting. " Living in the coun-
try, I have had to do much lifting and hard wwk, and In this
way I first caused the Rupture, and found the oKWtyle trasses
very uncomfortable to work in.
I have now been completely cared for more than six months
and can remove my truss without any sign showing that I erer
had been ruptured. My rupture, as before stated, was a very
troublesome case, the intestines coming down into the scrotum.
What makes my cure all the more remarkable, is that / mm
nearly tigkty of mgt; will be eighty the *7th of next June.
If everyone knew as much about your Dr. Pierces Truss as X
do, you could not supply the demand. You may use this letter
as you think best to convince other sufferers.
Yours respectfully, NSIL MT7WRO,
ANOTHER CURE OF RUPTURE I
210 Fiist An , S*attli, Wash., March 17th, 1801
Dr. Puree & Sen â
. Diak Sirs: âla April last yes r I got one of your double
trusses, as I was ruptured on both sides. After wearing it for
about six months, I was pleased to find my left side mrtd. The
right side being the wont of the two and a very old rupture,
although not cured yet, I am glad to say is much improved, and
I have every confidence in the Truss, as it is no trouble to wear
I and is a perfect retainer. I wore several so-called" trusses, but
nothing like yours.
I shall always speak well of and recommend your Truss to
all sufferers. Thanking you and wishing you every success, I
am, sirs.
Yours very respectfully, PHILIP H. COOS.
ELECTRICITY WAS THE REMEDY FOR HIM I
Morr&osc, Colo., May 19th, 1898.
Dr. Pitrct &â¢ Sen â
Gettlemss : â For the Benefit of others I desire to say that I
cm 52 years old ; have been in the mines for twenty-five years,
where I contracted my disease. I have been doctoring for about
eight years and have been to different hot springs without
much benefit. My disease is rheumatism and neuralgia, liver
and stomach troubles and spinal disease. Was almost para-
lyzed, and my blood was poisoned. I contracted these diseases
by working in lead ores and foul air in the mines. I received
your Electric Belt and Spinal Appliance about fi T e months ago,
and from the great benefit I have already received I think I
will soon be * wtllmmm. I was then suffering with pains day
and night, with swelling of the joints and poor circulation of
the blood ; but I am now ever so much benefited by using your
Belt and Appliance.
I am, yours respectfully, CHRIS. JOHNSON.

Dr. Pierce at Sen â
. Dear SiÂ»s : â It has been some little time since I received
your last Belt, and I have been waiting to see how things went.
First of all I must tell you of the one I bought for myself. I
have found that it has ' done me so much good that I feel it is
my duty to tell you something about it. It has ENTIRELY
CURED me of those Nervous Troubles and of what caused
them â rheumatism, neuralgia, etc. â and I have had them so
bad in my ears that I could not sleep. It has entirely cured m e
of Rheumatism, from which I have been a great sufferer for
years, and I feel better all around; digestion is better, stomach
troubles better and feel jollier and more lighthearted. I intend
to recommend it to anybody who wants to know anything
about electric belts. As I tell them, if you want a GOOD Belt
get "DR. PIERCES.

mitted reports regarding 1 rations through .
the regular army channels, and again on
Septemtx r 10. These reports were omitted i
from the published records of the War;
Department, but were to be printed, so he
said. In the next report.
Major Lee applied to the court to order
a copy of Governor Roosevelt's report
to be made a part of the minutes of the
the proceedings.
General Wade ruled in compliance with
the motion, and Governor Roosevelt said
that there were somfl supplementary re
ports to the report of September 10 which
he considered very important.
"They Include," he said, "the statements
of two captains, four lieutenants, a sur
geon and Captain lirown of the regular
Bervic
"Will you tell us," asked Major Lee,
"what, in your opinion. Is the value of
canned roast .beef issued at Cuba and else
where as an army ration?"
"I wish to say. unhesitatingly, that it
was utterly unfit and unwholesome for
troops. My . xperience proves beyond a
shadow of doubt or Question that at its .
the canned roast beef was unpalat
able, and at Its worst It was uneatable
and unwholesome."
Xo one had any further questions to ask \
the Governor and the hearing was closed, j
The court adjourned to Governors Island.
Eugene McAlexander of the Quarter
master's Department, who was on Gen
eral Kent's staff in Cuba, was the first i
witness at the Governors Island session. â¢
aid the cans of roast beef when :
opened presented a gelatinous, whitish '
mass, with some fibrous looking meat be
neath, which looked as if it had been
boiled. |
"Was the meat good to eat?" asked ;
Colonel Davis.
"The majority of the contents of the
cans I saw could not be eaten. The men
refused to eat It," replied the witness.
McAlexander said the greater part of ;
the refrigerated meat appeared very ;
fair. "The men complained they could ,
eat only a very small portion of each can
Of roast beef, if any at all." continued the
witness. "Under the conditions that sur- I
rounded us it was no use to complain. It
could not be bettered. Perhaps six or
eight ounces of the contents of each two
pound can was meat."
Sergeant James D. Guthrie, Company D,
Fifteenth Regiment, testified that the
canned roast beef was not of good odor
and had no nutriment. It became tainted
after the cans had be^n opened five or ten
minutes. None of it was very good. Only
about eight ounces in each two-pound tin
was eatable at all. He only ate the meat
once and then It made him sick to vom
iting. As a rule, the sergeant said, the re
frigerated beef was good, although per- ]
haps 20 per cent of it was tainted.
Captain M. B. Saffold said he had only |
tried the roast beef once. He was told
that it made the men sick, and he made
an inspection.
"It looked," said Captain Saffold, "like
boiled meat, with all the strength boiled
out of it and it tasted like tallow and
water."
"Had you any reason to believe the re
frigerated beef had been treated with
chemicals?"
"Absolutely none," answered Captain
Saffold. "I never thought of such a thing.
The refrigerated beef, so far as I knew,
was good/ __
Corporal Kelly of Company B, Thir
teenth Infantry, was the first witness to
Bay a good word for the much-abused
canned roast beef. He said: "I found no
bad roast beef. I thought It stringy, and
no salt had been used in cooking. I did
not eat much of it. I ate it perhaps fif
teen times. It did not look like roast

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 26, 1899.
STUPIDLY DRUNK WHILE
THEIR CHILDREN STARVE
Three Little McGib
ney Girls Rescued by
the Police.
MAMMA and papa nre drunk.
Please buy sisters and me some
thing to eat."
Such was the remark or
seven-year-old Ethel McGlbney as she
accosted Policeman Koegel on Con
verse street late yesterday afternoon.
"We have had nothing to eat since
yesterday." sh* continued. "I know?
little Ilene will die unless she Is given
some bread and milk."
Touched by her tearful pleading the
officer went to the home of the tot at
121 Converse street and found her pa
rents lying on the floor in a helpless
state of intoxication. A few feet from
them, lying on an Improvised bed,
which principally consisted of gunny
sacks, the officer discovered Ethel's
two sisters, one aged four and the
other two years. â¢
"That's Ilene," remarked the un
fortunate girl, pointing to her little
sister. "I know she is hungry. Won't
you please buy her something to, eat?"
Satisfied that the children were in
need of nourishment the kind-hearted
policeman summoned a neighbor, who
provided them with food. The inhu
man parents were then aroused from
their stupor and placed under arrest.
McGibney at first resisted, but was

troops ordered to the front were the First
Infantry Regiment of regulars, com
manded hy Colonel Evan Miles. That reg
iment at Fort Tampa was made a part of
the second division of the Fifth Army
Corps, commanded by General Lawtmi.
Colonel Miles, In command of a brigade,
was one of the three that fought valiantly
at El Caney. lie was taken sick in the
trenches before Santiago de Cuba, but. re
mained with his command till the surren
der, sharing with his troops all the hard
ships of the campaign.
Leaving Cuba ho was sent to Fort Mc-
Pherson on sick leave, where he remained
several months. October 12, 1898, he was
made a brigadier general and assigned to
a brigade at Greenville, South Carolina.
Continued illness contracted in the
trenches at Santiago forced him to re
linquish his command, and he asks to be
retired in his rank as he feels he will
never recover. With shattered health ho
cannot conscientiously remain on the
active list.
Brigadier General Evan Miles, like his
namesake and superior, General Nelson
A. Miles was appointed to the army
from civil life. The latter officer entered
Uncle Sam's military family aa a captain
soon quieted and removed â  with his
wife to the City Prison, where they
were formally charged with cruelty to
children. Their three unfortunate off
spring were also taken to the prison
and given In charge of the matron.
The house In which the McGlbneys
live was almost barren of furniture.
In the room In which the drunken
parents were found were a number of
that had contained beer. Tho
family larder was empty, except for a
can of herrings, which had not been
opened.
"We have not eaten anything since
yesterday," said the eldest child, who
Is remarkably bright for her age.
"Mamma and papa got drunk and
neglected to provide us with something
from Massacbusetts In May, 1861, -while
the former followed him from Pennsyl
vania, August 5 of the same year. Both
officers servi d with distinction during the
<"ivil War and passed into the Indian con
flict that followed. With the rank of cap
tain Evan Miles served under General O.
O. Howard In the fierce Nez-Perce Indian
war and also in the Bannock troubles in
Eastern Oregon.
For coarage and ability displayed dur
ing these tights he was brovetted major.
Colonel Nelson A. Miles was made a brig
adier general for the same service. Brig
adier General Evan Miles has been re
peatedly mentioned in orders for gallan
try and efficiency on the field of battle
by General O. O. Howard, General N. A.
>iil< s and also Inspector GeneraJ Breek
enridpe In <"Ã¼ba. who speaks of the bri
gade of Colonel Miles as one of the three
that assaulted and carried El Caney.
General Shafter since his return to this
city has spoken many times of the hot
El Caney fight, saying that after order
ing that assault be learned that the posi
tion was too strong for attack with that
force Just at that time, but he could not
recall the advance because the troops
were too impetuous and too full of fight.
Genera] ShnfttT added that a load was
lifted from his mind when he heard that
the three brigades had carried the place
with a rush. As General Shafter said,
nothing could stop the advance of the
soldiers at Xl Caney, and these soldiers
â were led by Chaffee, Bates and Miles.
Brigadier General Miles upon being re
tired will take up his residence on this
coast. Mr.*. Miles being in this city. I.lke
Shatter, he is practically a Calif ornian,
having marched from this State to his
last war. He is 61 years old and would

the matter; Under its contract with the
City Improvement Company the latter;
must keep the pavement in repair for five
years.
President McDonald said yesterday that
the work of replacing the injured pave
ment would be commenced at once. As
the broken places were clearly not the
result of traffic he has endeavored to fix
the responsibility for it This he has not
been able to do up to the present time.
It is intimated that enemies may have
placed coal oil. which is a solvent, on tho
street to injure the contractors who did '
the work of paving originally. It is pos
sible that carelessness on the part of men
delivering oil may have caused the dam-
age.
Some weeks since a resolution was pre- !
: to the Board of Supervisors com- !
pelling persons delivering oil to use re- !
ceptaclea from which the oil cannot leak.
This measure became a law. During the
discussion which ensued over the intro
duction of the resolution an instance of
gross carelessness was cited. An oil
wagon was driven on Market street from
Second to Third, leaving a well defined
trail of oil in its wake. This is thought
to have- contributed chiefly to the present .
condition of the pavement.

One big fleet arrived in port yesterdp-
and another sailed. Those that got away
were windbound and those that got in
couldn't make port sooner on account of
the dense fog that hung over the ocean
like a pall.
"For four days I did not get a glimpse
of sun, moon or stars," said Captain
Jackson, of the French mail boat Tropic
Bird, yesterday. "It was all guesswork
as to my position. I knew I was near
the Golden Gate, but that was all. Yes
terday morning at 1 o'clock I got a
glimpse of the north star and laid my
course by it. Four hours later 1 picked
up Point Reyes and then it was easy
sailing into port." Nearly all the other
masters that made port had an experi
ence similar to Captain Jackson's.
Between 7Â«a. m. and 5 p. m. yesterday
over thirty vessels of all descriptions
made port and fifteen passed out. Those
that came in were from all parts of the
earth, and those that sailed were bound
for widely separated points. From dif
ferent points along the coast came sev
enteen schooners, mostly lumber laden;
from Hawaii came the schooners Emma
Claudina and H. C. Wright, sugar laden;
from Nanaimo and Departure Bay came
I the ships Spartan and Lancing and
steamer Bristol, coal laden; from south
! em ports came the steamer Santa Rosa
with passengers and general merchan
dise; from Newcastle, Australia, came
the American barks Prussia and Sonoma,
coal laden; from Tahiti came the barken
tine Tropic Bird, laden with cocoanuts,
pearl shell, copra and vanilla beans; from
Antwerp came the British ship King
George with cement and general mer
chandise, and from Liverpool came the
British ship Marlborough Hill.
Among the departures was the steamer
China for the Orient, the whaler Gram
pus for the Arctic, the barks Ceylon,
Amy Turner and Martha Davis for Ha
waii and the ship Lucile for Vladivostok.
The Grampus will be gone three years.
She will pass two winters off the mouth
of the Mackenzie River, but only those
of her crew who so elect will remain
away the whole time. Each year the
whaling tender will take up new men to

The remains of Peterson's launch Amy

yesterday. Strange to say, although the
line tank was forward of the engine,
the latter was not damaged; but the cabin

to nieces. The forward part of the launch
is not so badly wrecked, but the engine is
the only part of the boat that will ever be
of any use again.

received from the secretary of the board
an order on the Comptroller for a war
rant. With this order pome of the men
went to Wells, Fargo & Co. and executed
a power of attorney to enable the bank
to collect the money at Sacramento. By
that means they get every $100 back less
$1 commission and 50 cents for a war
stamp. Others went to the brokers and
paid from 3 to 5 per cent besides the war
stamp to get the order cashed. To
make matters worse the money to pay the
men is in the hands of the secretary of
the commission and will remain there un
til it is sent by express to Sacramento at
the end of each month. Nothing better
than the Valentine bill has ever been
passed for the brokers and warrant
shavers of San Francisco. By means of it
they may take $600 a month out of the
employes of the Harbor Commission

CRUSHED BETWEEN
FENDER AND WHARF
Marcus Krogh Killed at
the Ferries While
Mending Fender
Piles.
MARCUS KROGH, a carpenter in the
employ of the Parafflne Paint Com
pany, came to his death in a pecu
liar manner at the ferries yester-
day.
All the slips used by the ferry-boats
are faced with fender piles. These, on
being struck by the steamer when making
a landing, will give about four feet, thus
breaking the force of the blow and sav
ing the vessel from damage. The piles
in question have no greater spring than
the four feet, as when they go back that
distance they bring up against a solid
wharf.
All the fender piles in the new ferry
slips are preserved by the parafflne paint
process. The pile is first painted, then
a wrapper of paraffined paper is put on
and over that Is nailed paraffined slats.
These latter are being constantly knocked
off by the ferry-boats and it was the duty
of Krogh and a man named August Rob
erts to replace them as fast as they were
destroyfd, so as to prevent the deadly te
redo from getting in his work.
Early yesterday morning Krogh and
Roberts went to work on the slip used
by the narrow-gauge steamers. Wharfin
ger Barry warned them several times that
It was dangerous to come up between the
feivie-r Diles and tbÂ«Â» wharf while the fer
of Good Templars of California, is dan
gerously ill at bis residence at Glendale,
in Los Angeles County, and so serious Is
his illness that there is no hope of his re
covery.
Deserted by Her Husband.

Law Library Trustees.
At a meeting of the life members of

terday John T. Doyle, Ralph C. Harri
son Russell J. Wilson, Edward R. Tay
lor John M. Burnett, Warren Olney and
Charles Page were elected trustees to

H. Murphy. 63<J Market st., lends money
on estates and second mortgages. â¢
ry-boats were docking, but they did not
heed him. About 1 p. m. Roberts was at
work in a small punt under the wharf
and Krogh was ashore getting some slats.
At 1:25 Krogh returned and began to de
scend on an improvised ladder on the fen
der piles. Just as his head got on a level
with the main stringer on the wharf the
steamer Newark entered the slip. In
stead of getting into the boat below him
as quickly as possible Krogh remained
where he was, and when' the ferry-boat
struck the fender piles his head was
caught betweeti that structure and the
wharf and crushed beyond recognition.
When the strain on the fender piles was
removed they sprang back into position
and the body dropped into the bay and
sank. A gang of men at once began grap
pling for it, but it was two hours before
they succeeded in recovering the body.
The deceased was a native of Denmark
and 50 years of age. For the last five
years he has been in the employ of the
Farafnne Paint Company and was consid
ered a steady, conscientious worker. Cap
tain Leale of the Newark did not know
anything about the accident until his
vessel came back from Alameda on the
2:30 trip. He did not even know that the
men were at work under the wharf at the
time.

CHIES, CUSTOMS OFFICER.
Arrest of the Latter for Attempting
to Tamper With a Six-Year-
Old Girlâ Her .Uncle
Indignant.
"I want to tell you something," angrily
remarked Jacob Glassman, a well-dressed,
middle-aged man, as he accosted A. J.
Bauchles in the City Prison last evening,
"if the courts do not punish you I will
kill you on sight. You're a dirty brute
and if I have to hang for it I will send
you to the Morgue."
Desk Sergeant Brown, fearing that
Glassman was about to assault Sanchles,
induced him to leave the prison. San
chies, who is a Custom-house officer, was
arrested yesterday afternoon for enticing
a six-year-old girl into a vacant house
and there taking liberties with her. The
alleged victim is the niece of Glassman.
She lives at 1907'^ Devisadero street.
According to the police Sanchies induced
the child to enter a vacant house contig
uous to her home. Her screams at
tracted the attention of one of her play
mates, who lost no time in notifying her
mother. The latter quickly entered the
unoccupied house and as Sanchies sought
to elude her she made a rush for him
after calling to a neighbor to summon a
police officer.
Sergeant Harper happened to be In the
vicinity and on being told of the alleged
crime he entered the house and placed
Sanchies under arrest. To the officer he
said that he entered the house intending
to inspect it with a view of renting it.
As he unlocked the door fie saw the girl
standing on the steps leading to the
house. As he entered she followed him,
after asking him if he intended to "buy
the place A few minutes later, he
claimed, the mother of the girl entered
and accused him of having attempted to
outrage her. He attempted to explain
that the girl followed him into the house,
when Mrs. Glassman made a rush for
him, after declaring that she Intended to
have him arrested.
Failing to convince her of his innocence,
he claimed he started to leave the house,
when he was arrested. ....
Sanchies persistently denied that he
had attempted to take advantage of the
little girl. He is a married man and it
was at the request of his wife that he
visited the house where the alleged crime
occurred. . . ,
The uncle of the girl, however, declares
that Sanchies is guilty of the charge pre
ferred against him.
"I am so convinced of his guilt, he ex
citedly remarked, "that if I had my re
volver I would not hesitate a minute to
kill him. When I heard of the outrage
I nlaoed a revolver in my pocket, intend
ing to visit the prison and shoot the

STETSON SEEKING FUNDS.
Said to Have Endeavored to Sell Stock
of His Road in London.
In a letter received in this city from
London comes the report that J. B. Stet
son, president of the North Pacific Coast
Railroad, has been endeavoring to dis
pose of some of the stock of that line in
FriKland to a syndicate composed of Eng
lishmen. Mr. Stetson is still abroad, and
no confirmation of the report could be ob
tained from any of the officials of the
road in this city. The purpose of the re
norted deal is said to be to obtain funds
with which to construct extensions of the
line as It is not a paying property at the
present time, owing to its restricted field
of operation. Nothing is known as to
what the result of Mr. Stetson's efforts
has been.

FINANCIERING
FOR HEALTH
What the New Discovery in Medi-
cal Science Proves*
YOIR HEALTH DEPENDS ON YOUR KIDNEYS.
To Test the Merits of Swamp-Root, the
Great Kidney Remedy, Every Reader of
"The Call" May Have a Sample Bot-
tle Sent Absolutely Free by Mail.
If you wish to be rich in health, you should be as careful
of your kidneys as a good financier is of his cash capital.
Your kidneys are you capital.
Your health depends principally on them.
If you can keep THEM well, you may possess your health in
Safety.
Now, by this is not meant that good financiering for health is
to overlook all the other organs and merely look after the kidneys.
Your other organs may need careâ but youp kdineys most, be-
cause they do most.
If you are sick, begin with your kidneys, because as soon as
they are well, they will help all the other organs to health.
The immediate symptoms and first
proofs of weak kidneys are pain or dull
ache in the back, rheumatism, dizzi-
ness, headaches, nervousness, heart
trouble, pain in the limbs, bloating, sal-
low complexion, puffy or dark circles
under the eyes, bladder irritation, sup-
pression of urine, obliged to pass water
often day and night, worn-out, tired
feeling, lack of ambition.
If your water, when allowed to re-
main undisturbed in a glass or bottlo j
for twenty-four hours, forms a sedi- j
ment or settling, or has a cloudy ap- j
pearance, it Is evidence that your kid- |
neys and bladder need immediate at-
tention.
Swamp-Root is the great medical tri-
umph of the nineteenth century; dis- j
covered after years of unliring effort
and research by the eminent kidney and !

Burns Handicap.
SATSUMA FINISHED SECOND
WHAT-ER LOU A VERY CLOSE
THIRD.
A Great Equine Struggleâ The Win
ner Piloted by Spencerâ The
Light Weights Could Not
Get Up.
The rich 510,000 Burns handicapâ over
one and a Quarter milesâ was decided at
Oakland track yesterday .and was cap
tured by Fleur de Lis, carrying 116
pounds, with Spencer on her back. The j
attendance was not up to that of last
year but still the spacious grand stand
was 'well filled with people, and the bet
tinig ring was a solid mass of specta
tors The weather had cleared off beau
tifully, but the track was muddy and
holding. Little attention was given the

ing the calling of the big. event on the

Jones, with What-Er Lou, the top
weight, almost as well fancied. The Sac
ramento delegation supported Fleur de
Lis and the mare rated a strong third
choice, with Satsuma, the bald-faced hero
of last year's race, the next most fancied.
Extravagant prices prevailed against all

After one false breakaway, Ferguson re

the procession, with Spencer astride Fleur

the far turn none of those back in the
bunch looked dangerous unless it .was
Napamax, and the result seemed to lie
between the three leaders already men

Er Lou. Then ensued a desperate duel to
the wire. Satsuma swerved the last part
and It costJxim the race, for Fleur de Lib
poked her handsome head over the wire
first by a yard, with What-Er Lou lapped
on their saddle girths, half a length away.
?n2Tl!Â£. Morinel finished a close fourtn,
one'lencth in advance of Napamax.
The winner was decorated with the cus
tomary floral horseshoe, and horse and
rider received an ovation. It was a great
race honestly contested. The keen ad
justment of the weights was a tribute to
the worth of the nandicapper, Brooks.
The best horses are supposed to carry
the heaviest imposts, and the top weights
headed the van The lightweights, from
lack of class and incompetent riders,
failed to prove a factor. This was from
no fault of the handicapper.
Five other events were run off, of which
number favorites took but two. The bet
ting was heavy, and the books had a
prosperous day of it.
Adam Andrew captured the opening
number at seven furlongs from an indif
ferent field, starting a slight favorite over
Bliss Rucker. He was ridden by Ruiz and
led Cardwell out nearly two lengths.
The talent fell heavily over the defeat
of Benamela in the six furlong sprint that
followed. The brown gelding had Spencer
In the saddle, finishing a trapped looking
third. Moringa, the second choice, also
piloted by Ruiz, experienced no difficulty
fn winning easily from Stromo, the light
weight of the company.
To Devin's cheap looking effort could
partly be ascribed the defeat of the warm
favorite, Humidity, in the six and a half
furlong jaunt. He seemed to be asleep
until too late, and then ran into the show.
The heavily backed Gualala, ridden by
Piggott. led Sombre past the judges half
a length, both hard ridden.
Nine selling platers started in the seven
furlong selling affair, fifth on the pro
framme. Through superior saddle work
pencer. on the 4*Â£ to 1 chance, Roadrun
ner, reached the wire first, over two
lengths in advance of Socialist. The fa
vorite. Una Colorado, ran- unplaced.
The finish between Montgomery and Pat
Morrissey in the final short six furlong
dash was the closest of the day, causing
much discussion among racegoers. The
former horse, a hot 4 to 5 favorite, earned
the verdict by a nose, though many
caught Morrissey first. Rubicon ran a
poor third.
Track Notes.
His Excellency. Governor Gagre was an
interested spectator of the races from
the clubhouse balcony.
The fair sex was well represented in the
grandstand. Fleur de Lis was a great
favorite with them.
Jo Terry of Sacramento was so elated
over the victory of his marc in the big
handicap that he invited his friends to
the refreshment booth at the end of the
betting ring and opened a pint bottle of
â¢wine.
Mike Hennessy, who rode What-Er
Lou, was very wrathy after the finish.
He declared that Spencer interfr-rred with
him on more than one occasion, and that
he was tired cf the slim rider's tactics.
Spencer is not above taking- every ad
vantage, but he generally escapes with
out a reprimand from the stang.
The ring was flooded with Montgomery
money, and this may have had something
to do with the showing made by Rubicon.
His exhibition was as bad as the im
provement in form shown lÂ«y Imperious
the day previous was striking.
THE ANGLING SEASON.
Whippers of Mountain Streams Do
Not iiook for Good Sport on the
Opening Day.
On account of the heavy â¢ rains which
we are experiencing, the outlook for fish-
Ing on Saturday next is decidedly bad.
The law, however, kindly allows us seven
months in which to enjoy the sport of
sports (to anglers), hence we graciously
submit to the All Powerful and believe
that he doe* all things for the best. The
rains not only benefit the farmer, the
fruit-grower, etc., but it is what the an
gler has wished forâ even prayed for.
The poor angler (financially) requires
rain and lots of it to insure his pleasures
for the season in the late months. The
well-to-do angler does not require quite
to much rain, as he can come pretty near
getting what he wantsâ to a pond
In front of his suburban home, stocked
with the best the hatcheries produce.
Should the weather moderate, the an
tler can count on any of the coast
â¢treams being in excellent condition with
in a week or ten days, and there is not a
sportsman in San Francisco who would
not willingly wait that length of time or
even longer to nave his expectations

CYCLE RACES POSTPONED.
Wat "Weather Prevents the Holding
of To-Day's Road Events.
The racing committees of the Bay City
Wheelmen and Olympic Wheelmen have
announced the postponement of their re
spective road races scheduled for to
day for one week owing to the wet
weather. The wheelmen are not at all
put out. however, for, together with the
rest of the people of the State, they are
thankful for the downpour and would
willingly postpone a dozen events under
similar conditions.
The announcement that the Olympics
would open their new tylck with a big
meet on April 16 was recfived with much
interest among the club and racing men,
who foresee in this track and the energy
of its owners an active year for the rac
ing end of the sport.
It is apparent now that Champion Jim

THE SAN FBANCISCO CA"LL, SUNDAY, MARCH 26. 1899.
WHY "RID" McCOY
DID NOT KNOCK
CHOYNSKI OUT
The Clever Lad Wants
Smaller Game.
TOO LIGHT FOR BIG MEN
BETTING PROVES THAT THE
FIGHT WAS ALL RIGHT.
The Winner Had No Financial Object
in Allowing His Opponent to
Stay Out the Twenty
Rounds.
There are a few disgruntled sports who
possibly lost a few dimes on the paris
mutuels on the result of the McCoy and
Choynskl fight who are now yelling
"fake." They contend that Billy Brady,
who is looking after McCoy's Interests,
had a deep finger in making up the
"fake" pie and that McCoy deliberately
permitted Choynski to remain on his feet
until the end of the twentieth round so
that those who were "In on the job"
could make a killing in the mutuels.
The absurdity of a statement of this
kind can be seen by a glance at the 'table
of parl mutuel wagers which is posted
in a local poolroom and is as follows:
Rounds. McCoy. Choyn&ki.
1 to 5 $462 *262
6 to 9 861 381:
10 to 13 Â£63 419
14 to 17 620 310
18 and over 694 408
Total number of tickets sold, 5285;
pays $7 20.
It stands to reason that If McCoy or his
dearest friends knew that the contest
would last the limit the line calling for
eighteen and over would have been played
several hundred stronger than the sum
stated in thp table. So much for the ex
plosion of the eighteen rounds and over
statements. ,-.*.*. ..
The fight, however, satisfied the most
expert ludges of the game that Choynsk;
is a dead bird and that McCoy fought a
careful battle, satisfied that if the contest
should go to the limit he would win on
the score of points. It certainly appeared
in some of the rounds that McCoy could
have easily put his opponent to sleep with
a well-directed right-hand punch on the
& if' these opportunities were offered the
question arises, "Why did he not take ad
vantage of the openings and finish the
game then and there? What could have
been his object in prolonging the eon
tP Harry Corbett states most emphatically
that he did not. hold any wagers that
Chovnskl would stand twenty rounds in
front of "the Kid." Possibly there may
have been considerable betting on this
proposition in New York and in the other
Eastern cities that may have caused the
artful McCoy to travel at ease until the
""'hen again, if McCoy was fighting un
der instructions from Brady, what could
have been the difference so far as the
"auction" pool betting is concerned
whether he knocked Choynski out in the
fifth round or allowed him to take pun
ishment until the referee was called upon
to decide the bout, which was McCoy s
from the first to the last round?
The fact of the matter is that McCoy
is as cunning as the proverbial reynard,
and by allowing his heavy-weight oppo
nent to remain, so to speak, on deck un
til the limit of the fistic argument was
reached he would be classed as only a
jabber, without having steam behind his
blows to terminate a battle whenever the
chance for so doing presented itself.
A quick defeat of Choynski by a
knockout blow would, in all probability,
end McCoy's career as a middle-weight,
and such "men as Tommy Ryan, George
Green, Billy Smith, Jno Walcott, etc..
would fight shy of the smiling "Kid,"
Who. by the way, is at present many J
pounds' too light to battle successfully i
against such men as Sharkey, Jeffries, I
Fhzsimmons, Corbett and other weighty
Jawbreakers.
The only thing connected with the fight
that would create suspicio.n that every
thing was not exactly as it should be- was
the selection of J. C. Kennedy as referee.
Kennedy is a particular friend ot Billy I
Hra.lv and he is also a warm friend of
Choynski. Doubtless the principals pre- |
ferred an Eastern man to referee the
game, being aware of the fact that some i
of the local referees are easily ap- |
proached.
If McCoy did agree to allow Choynski
to retire from the ring without suffering
a knock-out by a man who represents the ;
middle-weight class he certainly gave the [
thousands who witnessed the "mill" a ;
"run for their money," and possibly may j
have disappointed the blood-thirsty sports '
â¢who do not take any interest in a boxing j
contest unless they can see a knock-out j
and faces made brilliant by a liberal !
washing in human gore.
Choynski has now retired from the ring
after seeing fourteen years of hard serv- j
ice. He is ornamented with puffed lips and
an enlargement of the nose, the result of
McCoy's frequent visitations. "The Kid"
attended the Oakland races yesterday and
complained of a very sore arm, which
member stopped several hard swings that
were aimed at him by his opponent during
the argument. McCoy pocketed $3737 "37
as his share of the receipts and Choynski
finished his record as a prize-fighter by
taking the loser's end, which amounted to j
$2491 58. I
Several local sportsmen, who witnessed j
the contest and who were Interviewed last |
evening, said that they were thoroughly ;
satisfied with the contest and that McCY>y
acted a very wise part in not taking any
chances of being knocked out by a past
master of the game.

The Oakland golf course is in several
parts so muddy that it is quite heavy
work to go round it. In front of the

the ball must be lofted, while the player

COURSING_IN JTHE SUN.
Winners of the Bun Down of the
Open and Sapling. Stakes at
"Union Park.
A large crowd of men and women -who
take an Interest In the pleasures of
coursing was present at the meeting held
yesterday at Union Park. . The day was
very pleasant, as the sun, which has been
obscured during the week, smiled on the
gathering. The hares at this season of the
year are not in good form, and as a con
sequence the races were comparatively
short; still there were a few runs which
tested the quality of the dogs Maud S.

MR. RUBE LEVY
WILL OPEN THE
BALL SEASON
First League Game
To-Day.
PLACE: RECREATION PARK
NEW MANAGERIAL DEAL WILL
LIVEN THINGS UP.
San Francisco and Oakland Teams
Will Cross Bats This Afternoon
and Both Will Play
for Blood.
Te earlie ballto3ser. yclept R. Levy,
alias Rube, the erstwhile idol of the kin
dergarten, will have the honor of starting
the spheroid in action for the opening of
the California Baseball League season of
1599 at Recreation Prfrk this afternoon.
Mr Levy having been selected to umpire
the game between Cal Ewing's young
men of Oakland and Hank Harris' aggre
gation of home talent, he will be charged
with all the responsibilities that develop
upon the autocrat of the diamond.
A large crowd is expected at the open
ing game to-day, for there is promise of
a big revival of interest in the national
game this season. Although the sport
has enjoyed prosperity in the East, the
lovers of the game on this coast were not
very enthusiastic last season. The reason
was the business was badly managed.
The circumstance of two teams being lo
cated in this city, neither of which could
he â¢ depended upon for a good article of
ball, dampened the ardor of local rooters.
Then there were eight club* on the cir
cuit with one or two so far out of the
race that they failed to arouse interest,
and in addition to those drawbacks the
management continually juggled with the
schedule and forfeited games until people
became thoroughly disgusted with affairs.
Under new and competent management
having interest of the sport at heart, and
with evenly matched teams secured under
national agreement contracts, in a race
for a pennant and a $1000 purse, there
ought to be plenty of spirited rivalry and
improvement all along the line. There
will be no swapping of players this sea
son and the sport will be conducted with
a view of fostering interest in it. Base
ball is the only sport handled by profes
sionals that does not depend on the gam
bling clement for financial success, and
that interest in it is being revived 4n thfs
neck of woods is evidenced from the
fact that amateur teams are being or
ganized all through the State. The prob
ability is that one amateur league will be
formed with an interior circuit, and that
the teams will play on Sunday mornings
at RecreatLon Park. Another good sign
that augurs well for the sport is the
brisk demand for private boxes being
made by representatives of a number of
the prominent social clubs.
The league schedule provides for the
opening game between Watsonville and
Santa Cruz in the former town, but the
grounds were swamped in the recent
storm, and as the Santa Cruz grounds are
under water owing to the overflow from
the San Lorenzo River the game must be
postponed. San Jose will open in Sacra
mento, and the only other opening game
is the one scheduled for this city.
The teams will be distributed "over the
diamond as follows:
San Francisco. Positions. Oakland
Iberg Pitcher Moskiman
Hartman C atcher Hammond

O'Neill Second base L. Hammi-nd
Rellly Third base Lange

fael and enjoy a live-bird shoot through
the invitation of Mr. Lucas, who will
have a select lot of birds gathered for
the occasion.
The Union Gun Club has arranged an
elaborate programme of trap-shooting
events for the season. Shoots will be held
on the fourth Sunday of each month
commencing on March' 26 and ending on
September 24. The contests will take
place on the Lincoln Gun Club grounds in
Alameda. To reach the grounds aporta
men will take quarter to the hour nar
row-gauge boats and Oakland narrow
gauge train, getting off at. the first stop
of train.
Trap-shooting will be in order this
afternoon at the Olympic Gun Club
grounds. After the regular club contests
special match raei-s will be decided.
HO! iOR THE BAY.
To-Day Yachts Will Leave Their
Winter Quarters in the
Lagoon.
The continued rain is delaying the
yachtsmen in their preparations for open
ing' day. for it renders it impossible to
paint their craft, or do any out
side work. To-day the Corinthian
yachts will be brought out of
the lagroon at Tiburon to their an
chorages In front of the clubhouse. When
the drawbridge was raised on October 30
of last year to permit the yachts and
arks to pass into the lagoon it was ar
ranged that the yachts should go in tlrst
and the arks afterward. As the Corinth
ians bear the expense of raising the
bridge, it is only fair that the yachts
should take precedence. The bridge was,
however, raised at 12 o'clock last night
to let the arks out, the tide suiting at that
hour, and there being a moon. The bridge
will be raised again to-day (Sunday.
March 2t">.> at about noon for the yachts
to come out frr^m their winter quarters.
New members are being added qftite
rapidly to the roll of the California Yacht
Club, "about twenty having come in re
cently The schooner Lily V, formerly of
the ("'alifornia Beet, has been sold, and
now lies to the north of rhe Sausalito
ferry slip. Commodore Allen M. Clay has
put a handsome single stick into his sloop
Pactolus and i-< thoroughly overhauling
the boat at Jules Hartman's wharf. So
many yachtsmen are at work on Sundays
on their craft near the California club
house that the scene reminds one of a
shipyard. On June 17 the Corinthians will
cruise up the Oakland Creek and at tho
invitation of Commodore Clay will be the
guests of the CaJfornia' Club. On the
following day the two fleets will cruise
together under the orders of Commodore
Carl Westerfeld out toward the Heads,
returning on the afternoon tide.
The sloop Iris will have her cabin re
decorated and will be put into commission
at an early date; her sail area will be en
larged, and it is stated that her owners
intend to enter her in all the open regat
tas of the season. She will be command
ed by G. E. Dorn and will sail under the
flag of the Encinal Yacht Club.
The Oakland Canoe Club is displaying
great activity and has prepared a quite

WILL ACCEPT THE TRUST.
Merchants' Association Agrees to
Pass Upon Requests for City-
Improvements.
The Merchants' Association has ac
cepted the trust imposed upon It by the
Supervisors recently. This was to pass
upon the requests of improvement clubs
and individuals for various improve
ments. The following cemmunicatior
was received by the Supervisors yester
day:
"On behalf of the board of directors
of the Merchants* Association, we beg
to acknowledge the receipt of Resolu
tion No. 2570 (Fourth Series), and de
sire to express to your honorable
board our deep appreciation of the
highly complimentary evidence 0/
your confidence in the judgment and
labors of the Merchants' Association
While we realize the great difficulty
of the task of complying with your
request, we accept the responsible
trust as a public duty. In view of the
various needs- of the city and the long
list of improvements petitioned for by
improvement clubs and ' others, it be
comes clearly apparent that a correct
solution of the problem to be solved
requires a thorough study of the dif
ferent departments of the city govern
ment and a vÂ« ell-defined and -harmon
ious plan for administration and im
provement.
"The necessary investigation for
this purpose will re ;uire much labor
and research and consume consider
able time, but we hope to be able to
make a report to your honorably
board in time to be of service to you
in making up the tax levy for thÂ«
coming fiscal year. The first steps tÂ«
be taken by this board in this direc
tion will be to place the various ques

held on Thursday evening. March 39

SERIOUS ILLNESS OF

WAS RECENTLY OPERATED ON

tient, a Close Attendant in the
Sick Chamber.
Henry C. Lathrop. the brother of Mr?.
Leland Stanford. Is very ill at the Stan
ford residence, corner of California and
Powell streets, with small possibility of
recovery. For years he has been a suf
ferpr from dropsy, and since his return
from "Washington, on the 15th inst., has
been confined to his bed. So serious h;is
been the condition of the patient that
Mrs. Stanford has been in constant at
tendance in the sick chamber.
A surgical operation was performed
yesterday by Dr. R. H. Curtis, the family
physician, and at a late hour last night
Mr. Lathrop was resting easier. Mrs.
Stafford stated that she believed the
patient would rally, as the tapping opera
tion appeared to give him considerable re
lief. Dr. Curtis made several visits dur
ing the evening and â¢ himself as
hopeful for the best results.
Mr. Lathrop is unmarried and has made
his home at the family mansion for a
number of years.

CLOSE OF THE
OPERA SEASON
BY STEVENS.
THE opera season is over. The
gorgeous opera gowns and
cloaks, the accordeon hat that
in unexpert hands opened with
the petulant pop of the pistol,
may be stowed away to camphorated
comfort against the coming of an
other season. The sumptuous jewels
that have illumined the past :jr
night may be returned to their
raskets, or to their owners. The cab
man, who has been devouring terrapin
every morning during the last two
weeks, may go back to his regular diet
of beans and beer. The transient dress
suit may rest untenanted and recover
its knees and elbows. For the season is
over. The Grand Opera House is dark
and deserted. Only the sound of the
r.ntA falling due, the patferr of the mort
gage on the roof, the lament of the tai
lor and the modiste will remind us of
the glory gone.
The best all round season of opera
that San Francisco ever enjoyed, the
most expensive two weeks since the
Patti engagements of palmy days,
closed yesterday afternoon in the
Grand Opera House. The receipts for
th^ season were, I am authoritatively
informed, in thÂ» vicinity of $$0,000. Mr.
Ellis will, in all probability, return for
a longer ensragement in November
next, bringing with him Melba, the
New York Symphony Orchestra, the
same company (practically) that we
have enjoyed this time, and in addition
a strong rombination of German sing
ers to appear in the Wagner operas.
Mr. Ellis has an, option on the Grand
Opera House for November. If he does
not take advantage of it, Maurice Grau,
with the Metropolitan Opera Company,
will. We have turned out handsomely,
expensively, for the ElHs season; the
wires have told the tale to all the
world; and our good name is regilded in
the minds of- managers. Once again
we can pose opulently as the impre
sarios' Klondike.
The farewell performance of yester- i
day afternoon, which consisted of the J
double bill of "Lucia" and "Pagliacci,"
was notable for a crowd nearly as large,
but better policed, than ttjat of last
Monday night, and for the remarkable
singing of Melba in the title part of
Donizetti's masterpiece. Almost any
six singers can make a success of the â¢
"Ijucla" sextet, which sings itself, so to
speak; but only a wonderful soprano
can lift the part of Lucy, in fact the
whole opera, to success at this time of
day. Mr. Grau has elected to exclude
this, as well as other equally undrama
tic works, from his future repertories;
and it is 6afe to say that Meltoa is per
haps the only active singer of the day
who can make the work acceptable to
a representative American audience.
"Lucia," better than "The Barber," bet
ter even than "Juliet," brings out the
surpassing qualities of her voice and
art. The mad scene we had already
heard Melba sing on several other.occa
sions. The piece is not dramatic, it is
.not real, it might illustrate any phase
of mind and mood better than it does
those of poor, demented Lucy; but it
runs the gamut of birdie vocalization
and spells ridicule for the second-rate
singer who attempts its difficulties, in
this capricious bit of Donizetti Melba
reaches the superlative of her tone and
technique. She shames the flute that
accompanies her. This mad song of

-â  s ..f the great stage while the
others Btand around the "front of the
house" and look Sweet and important
simultaneously doesn't care a rap for
their opinion. He has his views and
is delighted at an opportunity to ex
press them.
.Mr Fried does not rank in impor
tance with Mr. Ellis,. still his services
are invaluable to the big aggregation
of melody jerkers. Mr. Fried is the
chorus master, and his title tells the
story of his labors and struggles. He
it is who is supposed to hustle around
when the company arrives in town
and engage embryo Melbas and Bon
narrts to till up and round out the nu
cleus of a chorus the aggregation car
ries. But he doesn't have to hustle
any so as to be perceptible; the as
pirants for lyric fame do the hustling.
AH Mr. Fried has to do is to make his
selections from the armyâ also his
termsâ and get rid of the surplus
stock.
Mr. Fried is given entire supervi
sion of thi; work, oven to the paying
of the sup. rs, and for the latter he is
allowed $1.30 per man for each per
formance.
Now right h\re is where Mr. Fried
fairly chuckles with glee. That $1.50
per "is all. -'velvet" for him; at least
it has been during the San Francisco
season, for he doesn't have to pay his
"help" a cent; on the contrary, they
fairly tumble over one another in their
efforts to pay him for the proud privi
lege <>f carrying a spear or holding
aloft a tinfoil wine gobk-t and telling
Melba's is an unforgettable lesson in
the possibilities of the human voice.
The enthusiasm was in proportion with
the crowd and the occasion yesterday
afternoon, and after a prolonged ap
plause Meiba sang a song from
"Martha."
There is little else to tell, except that
Ceppi was in the pink of voice and
sang a splendid Edgardo and that the
good old sextet went twice, as usual.
The "Pagliacci" performance was good,
but not as good as before. Pandolfini
had his own part of Canio and acquit
ted himself with honor, lie Vries had
his own part of Silvio, but sickness
was still thick in his voice. Bensaude
again furnished an admirable prologue.
Chalta's Nertda was impressively dra
matic, but her singing was inclined to
be harsh and stringy. This was Chalia's
nd appt.arance during the season.
I think she suffered from underwork.
All in all the season was a great suc
cete. Mr. Ellis will go on record as
one impresario who kept his word, as
well as mortal could, to the last letter.
And we did the rest with pomp and
generosity. We are sure of him and
he is sure of us. and San Francisco will
be writ in capitals on his map for fu
ture seasons. And now we can pack
up our spectacular clothes and go back
to the old thingsâ the Bostnnians, the
Tivoli, the Chutes. and Morosco's,
where' comic opera will reign or ruin,
commencing next Saturday l.ight.

the audience in six verses and, an en
core all about the surpassing quality
of the red liquor it is supposed to con
tain. Small -wonder that. Mr. Fried is
satisfied with the financial success of
the season and deigns to. hand out a
verbal boutonniere or two on the
fondness of San Franciscans for grand
opera, which they can't understand,
much less sing.
That is the reason, too, why the
girls have been somewhat "shy" on
beaux for the past two weeks and
have had/to rely upon tSeir papas to
take them down to the Mission street
aviary. Yes. it is a hard, cold, undis
puted fact that. Mr. Fried has waxed
fat since his arrival here, for not only
has he been enabled to salt down that

the manager, but the aforesaid chorus

For Grip, Influenza and S'ubborn
The First Stage.
If you now think that "77" is a GOOD
cure, try it at the first stage of a Cold
and you will then think it a PERFECT
WONDER, it "breaks up" the Coid so
suddenly.
"77" also "breaks up" Colds that
"hang on," but it takes longer â so that
the Dollar Flask is bestâ if your drug-
gist does not keep this size in stock,
take a 25c vial and ask him to send for
a flask; it is the most economical.
"77" cures Grip, prevents Pneumonia.

men have actually paid him for the
privilege of "going on." Not much,
maybe, but when you consider that in
"Aicla." for instance, there Were over
100 local men employed in the chorus,
even 50 cents apiece would make a
comfortable day's income for the in
genlus little chorus master.
That, too, explains the secret of the
attendance of certain clubmen at the
opera every night; those clubmen who
succeed in breaking into the Bo
hemian, or University, or Cosmos, on
a small salary and drop in of an even
ing and fill out a card party for as
much as fO cents' worth of benedic
tine and brandy after having dined at
a three-for-two rotisserie. It has
all alung been a drop mystery to
other and more favored members of
their set how they managed it, but
the mystery is solved.
It might require considerable shrewd
financiering to scrape up the price of
a ticket each night, but 50 cents to
Mr. Fried is within reach of everybody..
It also accounts for the fact that
only the last to leave the body of the
theater w.-re fortunate enough to catch
a glimpse of these clubmen waiting
under the awning â for their carriages
possiblyâ but then it requires a man
of agility to wash off the grease paint,
fct into his dress suit and reach the
ront of the house In time to display
himself even to the loitering few.
Some of these clubmen can singâ a
little. Others would discredit a frog
with bronchial affection, but as long
as they were prompt with their 50
cents it mattered little to. Mr. Fried,
for there were enough who could
make a noise, aided and abetted by
the orchestra, to satisfy the public.
Xow that the secret is out, swell
dom is mighty careful about telling
the girls about the number nf times
they heard Melba. for fh"e dear crea
tures have an embarrassing way of
lifting their eyebrows and respond
ing, oh, so sweetly:
â Ah. indeed.' from the front of the
house, or tht; stage?"

IS IT A TRIFLE?
THAT COMMON TROUBLE, ACID
DYSPEPSIA OR SOUR
STOMACH.
Now Recognized as a Cause of Se-
rious Disease.
â  Acid dyspepsia, commonly called
heartburn or sour stomach, is a form
of indigestion resulting from fermenta-
tion of the food. The stomach being too
weak to digest it, the food remains un-
til fermentation begins, filling the sto-
mach with gas. and a bitter, sour,
burning" taste in the mouth is often
present. This condition soon becomes
chronic and being an every day occur-
ence is given but little, attention. Be-
cause dyspepsia is not immediately fa-
tal, many people do nothing for the
trouble.
Within a recent period a remedy has
been discovered prepared solely to cure
dyspepsia and stomach troubles. It is
known as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
and is becoming rapidly used and pre-
scribed as a radical cure for every form
of dyspepsia.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets have been
placed before the public and are sold
by all druggists for 50 cents per pack-
age. It is prepared by the F. A. Stuart
Co., Marshall, Mich., and while it
promptly and effectually restores a vig-
orous digestion, at the same time is
perfectly harmless and will not injure
the most delicate stomach, but on the
contrary by giving perfect digestion
strengthens the stomach, improves the
appetite and makes life worth living.

"~~ LEGAL NOTICES.
NOTICE of Testamentary Inquests.â The late
JAMES WEIR, of Saint Clouds. Blackrock. in
the County of Dublin. Esquire, by his will dated
12th of October. ISM, bequeathed the follow-
, Ing legacies, amongst others, namely: One
Thousand Pounds to Mrs. Rachel Sandilan.d;
One Thousand Pounds to the children .of the
late Andrew Brown; One Thousand Pounds to
each of the seven children of Testator's wife's'
sister, Isabella Fallow, namely, Jana*s Fal-
low. William. Fallow, John Fallow. Gavin
Fallow. Janet Fallow, Mary Fallow and Ag-
n es Fallow; One Thousand Pounds to Mrs.
Grace Barr, formerly Steele; One Thousand
Pounds In equal shares amongst the children
of John Steele, son of Mary Steele; One
Thousand Pounds to the Issue living at the
death of the Testator of James Weir, who
died In his lifetime; One Thousand Pounds
to each of â¢ the six children of Testator's
brother, Thomas Weir, deceased, namely, â 
James Weir. Francis Weir, Andrew Weir,
Agnes Weir, Elizabeth Weir and Margaret
Weir. -. V
The Testator recited that Borne of the per-
sons who might be entitled to legacies under
his will were, the Testator believed, resident
In America, Australia and New Zealand, and
It contained the following clause: "I hereby
declare that every person entitled to a legacy
under this my will, shall within a period of
three years from the day of my death, send
In to my trustee or trustees a claim (In writ-
Ing) for such legacy, and any person who
shall not send in such claims, as aforesaid,
shall absolutely forfeit all benefit which he or
she might have otherwise claimed under this
my will, and the legacy hereinbefore be-
queathed to him or her shall be dealt with
as a lapsed legacy." And .the Testator di-
rected his trustees, as Boon as conveniently
might be after his death, to cause advertise-
ments to be Inserted in newspapers, requir-
ing all persons entitled to legacies to send in
their claims. *
The Testator died 30th of October. IS9B, and
said will and one codicil were, on the 18th
November, 189 S. duly proved by Sir William
Flndlater, Robert Bell. James Anderson
Merry, the executors and trustees thereof.
Now. all such of above-named legatees
as have not already done so, and' all
other (If any) persons claiming to be
legatees or to be beneficially entitled
under the said will an! codicil, are
hereby required ' to send In to the
Bald executors and trustees, at the office of
the undersigned solicitors, claims (in writ-
ing) and the necessary proofs of identifica-
tion, and the trustees will, at the expiration
of a period of three years after the death, -
finally wind up the estate and distribute the
then remaining assets of the testator with-
out reference to any claims, except those
which shall have been sent in within said
period. The executors have collected and
realized a very large proportion of the Tes-
tator's assets, and they have paid the Testa-
tor's debts, and thus will shortly be in a po- '
sition to ray the above-mentioned legacies,
and to distribute their Testator's estate (ex-
cept, of course, suoh part of the residuary
property as It may be necessary to retain for
three years). â  â¢
The executors believe that they already pos-
sess the addresses of the above-named lega-
tees, but for extra precaution, and in pur-
suance of their Testator's directions, publish
this advertisement, and particularly request
each named or Indicated legatee to send in
a formal written claim without further delay.

THE SAX FRASTCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 26, 1899.
"ROB ROY" MACDONALD IS
HANDY WITH THE GLOVES
Pride of the Bostonians Wears an Extra Coat of Grease Paint, and
Walter Watson Takes a Vacation.
WALTER WATSON has taken to
the chaparral and will not resume
instructions in the marriy art un
til after the Bostonians conclude
their engagement in this city and are
mibs on their way eastward.
This interruption of Mr. Watson's pro
fessional duties is all due to W. H. Mac-
Donald, who nightly entrances the Co
lumbia patrons with his heroic inperson
ation of the Scottish chieftain. In his
kilts and plaids Mac Donald can easily be

manhood, an Ideal athlete. Y> t few of
his admirers really know him to be such,
for sti'^'o appearances are so deceptive.
Hut Walter Watson can tell you all
about Mac Donald's prowess, for he
knows.
Trouble breaks out between the Mac-
Donald and Watson clans every
time the Bostonians pay a visit to
this city. Ten years ago. during the
company's initial Western tour, the two
WHEAT DEAL
NETTED HIM
A FORTUNE
Denis Kearney's Lot
Changed.
HE KNEW WHEN TO SHORT
ASCRIBES FORTUNE TO HIS OLD
POLITICAL TRAINING.
Intended frying Wall Street, but
Will Stay in This City and
Will Operate in
Sugar.
The dawn of another life is breaking
over the earthy horizon of Denis Kearney.
The man who once held the political des
tiny of San Francisco in the palm of his
hand is now a wealthy operator on the
floor of the local stock exchange, with a
bank roll at his back amounting to some
thing like two hundred thousand dollars,
all of which he made during the last year.
Kearney has been so successful during
the last few months that he contemplated
moving his family across the continent to
New York, where he intended to carry on
his marvelously successful deals on Wall
street. In fact, Mr. Kearney had hid mind
made up to leave with his family for New
York and Wall street within a few days,
but something unexpected happened
which called for a radical change in his
plans.
Dame Fortune is indeed smiling her
brightest on Denis Kearney. He started
Â«Jiis career as a speculator in stocks with
a capital consisting chiefly of brains, ac
tivity and shrewdness, and in one short
year ho has amassed a fortune that will
keep him and his kith and kin on the soft
side of Easy street the rest of their lives.
The man against whose political career,
manipulations and memory many a brick
has been shied is now interested in a
sugar and wheat deal that promises to
add a princely sum to his vast accumu
lations.
'The story of Denis Kearney's career on
the stock exchange and his sudden rise to
wealth is one of dramatic recital. It was
in the recent Leiter wheat deal, which
wrought ruin and disaster to the plucky
young Chicagoan and innumerable
wealthy individuals and concerns who
were in on the deal, that Denis Kearney
made his first real start on the gilded
path to fortune.
When the influence of Joe Lelter's
manipulations in wheat became apparent
in the local market Kearney's shrewdness
asserted Itself. While wildly excited and
mystilied operators in the local wheat pit
were standing aghast at the results of
the Napoleonic manipulations of the
wheat pit, Denis Kearney was coolly fig
uring out the situation.
The price of May wheat steadily ad
vanced to a point over and beyond that
of any of the previous years. There were
few who disputed the power of Leiter to
force the price of wheat up to whatever
point would best suit his fancy. Denis
Kearney was the exception. He watched
the steady rise in the wheat market like
a cat ready to spring upon its victim.
When it reached its topmost price Denis
Kearney felt the impending crisis in his
bones. He risked all he possessed in the
world on his judgment. The daring ten
dencies and aqfite shrewdness of his po
litical days were handy allies in this mo
ment of uncertainty.
Kearney shorted.
If he had faltered or tarried a day long
er the chance of his lifetime would have
been wafted away in 1 the air.
The crash came and the deposed dicta
Hielanders came together for the first
time. Watson was then instructor for
the Olympic Club and had just started
Jim Corbett, his favorite pupil, on his
professional career. Mac Donald saw Cor
bett and admired his fistic abilities. He
wanted to meet the man who had edu
cated so finished a boxer, and the two
soon came to know each other well.
Now. Mac Donald is no lobster. He
stands six feet one inch in his Stewart
plaid stockings and weighs 212 pounds.
He is a Scotchman by birth and comes
from a family of giants. Mac Donald pere
measures six feet four and a half inches,
while the vocalist's brother is six I
three and a half inches tall. An uncle on
his paternal side measured six feet tive
inches and bad the phenomenal chest
measurement Â©f fifty-two inches The
vocalist has "pniv in" for athletics ever
since he was a boy. He is an expert
horseman, can shunt remarkably well and
away down in Maine, where he spends
tor of our political affairs was suddenly
transformed into a man of means. Xi ar
my had sold an immense quantity of
wheat just before the unprecedented drop
in its price occurred. He cleared fully
$100,000 on the downfall of I>eiter's corner. !
Stimulated by his success. Kearney con- ;
tinued to make sharp deals in wheat. J
During the last few months, however, he
has become interested In sugar deals j
whicli have netted him thousands of dol
lars.
When a Call reporter called last night
at the home of Denis Kearney, at 656
Harrison street, to interview him in refer
ence to his intention of moving to New j
York to become a Wall-street operator,
he was first disinclined to discuss his j
affairs. He referred to his recent success !
in an extremely modest manner.
"Well. I did Intend to take a trip to New !
York." he said, "but I have changed my
mind, at least for the present. I will con- j
tinue my operations here for a while ;
longer. I never entertained any serious :
intentions of moving to New York to stay \
there permanently. I have spent the
greater portion of my life in California,
and here I intend to remain.
"Yes, it is true that I have brert quite
successful in my dealings on the Stock
Exchange, but I don't know that that
will interest anybody but my family and
intimate friends. 1 have no desire to es
timate my success. I have made consider
able money, but I cannot say just how
much. I have dealt In stocks more or less
for years back, but of course 1 have not
operated as extensively nor as success
fully as I have during the past year.
"When the Loiter deal was on. I saw a
good chance to clean up some money and
I took advantage of it. I had inside in
formation which 1 coupled v^th my own
judgment and the result was I came out
of the deal with a fortune. In the stock
market a man wants to watch the other
fellow carefully. If he is successful in do
ing that and display? pood cool judgment
the rest comes easy. How did I pet my
sfart? Well, like anybody else. I kept

Heavy Manipulator in Stocks.
his summer vacation, he pulls a boat all
day long on the lake with no other effect
than the Inauguration of widespread
famine.
And Mac Donald can boxâ now. Like
Corbett, he has outstripped his instructor
and is quite competent to put up his
hands with anybody as well as he is to
tear off a yard or two of vocal melody.
Matters reached a critical stage when the
Bostonians were here the last time.
Walter was shy, but the tujiester was in
sistent, so they had two or three animat
ed rounds.
When the company arrived here a week
ago. the first thing MncDonald did after
loading his pockets with silver (he is a
stanch Bryanite), was to dig up his old
friend Watson.
"Just one little round, Walter, old boy,
just to take the stiffness out of my joints,"
pleaded Mac Donald.
"Now, see here. Mac. You know
bloomin" well you have me at a disadvan
tage. You can bat away at me all you
please and it don't make any difference.
but if I should shove me fist against that
pen-pointed nose of yours it would be all
oiT with you for a week. Now sit down
and have a smoke, an' don't go to ban
term' me."
However, Mac was insistent and Wat
son finally consented. In a few seconds
the gloves were adjusted and at it they
went. It was short, but well worth the
price of admission. They shook hands at
the wind-up Just as warmly as they ever
<iid, but Watson deemed it prudent to an
nounce a vacation to his pupils to avoid
further endangering a sincere friendship,
and also to make external applications of
b( efsteafe and oysters.
That is also the reason that Mac Donald
is using large quantities of grease paJnt
on his proboscis this week to give it a
natural appearance.
myself thoroughly posted on the situation
arid when my opportunity came 1
grasped It.
"When Loiter controlled the wheat pit
I thought there was a chance to make
some money if a man played his cards
shrewdly. I watched the price of wheat
steadily rise and when I thought it had
reached its limit I shorted. Of course, I
took a great chance, but then at that
game a man has to take chances in or
der to reap its benefits.
"At present I am engaged in bnlling
sugar, and I expect to add a little more
to my wealth. I think there is consider
able money to be made in wheat this
year and 1 do not intend to overlook the
chance. I have no desire to say anything
further on my success. It is a matter
that concerns me only."
What Company I Is Dome.
Mrs. W. W. Funge received, with the
last mall, two very interesting- letters
from her boys in Company I, First Cali
fornia Volunteers. The stories of the bat
tles in which this company was engaged
are very interesting, though not alto
gether new, as they have already been
(lashed across by cable. Company I was,
at the time the letters were written, do
inp interior guard duty, although it was
kept biisy for five days and nights with
hardly a moment's rest on the trail of
ambushed Filipinos. The men are suffer
ing terribly from the heat, and in one en
gagement thirteen men dropped in ten
minutes from sunstroke. It has suffered
very little, however, fn>m Filipino bullets,
so little, in fact, that after one engage
ment where the bullets were falling like
hail, only one man was killed, and it has
since been christened the "bullet-proof
company." Its members are anxious to
come back home, but are not grumbling,
so long us there is lighting to be done.
The boys apparently enjoy the fighting
thoroughly, but the weather inflicts great
hardships upon them, and the food is not
always of the very best.
PITHS OF THE
BECKER GANG
NOW DIVIDED
James Creegan Sent
to Folsom.
DEAN GIVEN HIS FREEDOM
THE "DUTCHMAN" IS NOW IN
SAN QUENTIN.
McClosker Was Acquitted and Has
Departed â End of the Famous
Nevada Bank Forgery-
Case.
James Crpppan. the famous "middle
man" of the Becker gang, has been taken
to Folsom Trison. where he will serve a
term of two years. thf> sentence being Im
posed upon him yesterday by Judge
Dunne fer his complicity in the big- for
gery in which the Nevada Bank lost Just
$22,000.
Creegan appeared before Judge Dunne
at the opening of court yesterday morn
ing and pleaded guilty to the charge
as;ainst him. A few minutes later the
court pronounced sentence and Creegan
marched back to jail between his guards.
As the prison doors swung open to receive
him out from his cell walked A. H. Dean
into the free world. The iron door swung ,
to again, the bolt was slipped and Cree
gan prepared for his "trip across the
bay."
Not so with Dean. He turned and
looked at the prison that had so long)
held him, bid his friends good-by and,
penniless, started toward the heart of the
city to find a temporary- shelter until he
can arrange to depart for his home In
New York.
Such is the end of the prosecution of the
cleverest "brace" of bank "operators" in
the world to-day. Becker, the penman,
known as the "Dutchman," in whose
many forgeries but one flaw can be found
and "that is his handiwork is more per
fect, more artistic than even the pro- |
ducts from the steel engraver's hand, is [
now "doing" seven years in the peniten- i
tiary. Oeegan has been sentenced, as
stated. Dean has been freed and McClos
k. r. an alleged accomplice, has been
tried, acquitted and discharged from cus
tody. The ends of justice have been sub- â 
served, however, ami the banking world j
rests easy, for Becker, the prince of for
gers, has been takt-n from his lawless
task and now weaves the gunny beside
otht-rs of his ilk.
The matter of the court proceedings
yesterday was of short duration. Judgt;
Dunno had disposed of a few minor cases
and then called that of James Creegan,
forgery. Creegan rose from his seat be
side Captain Seymour and. addressing the
court, said that he pleaded guilty to the
charge against him. waived time and
asked that sentence be imposed.
At this juncture District Attorney Mur
phy walked to the bar and made a plea
for the prisoner. The District Attorney j
first gave a brief history of the crime for :
which the prisoner was about to suffer
sentence; how Dean had drawn a draft
for $12 in a Woodland bank upon the
Crocker- Woolworth Bank of this city,
how Becker had raised it to $22,000, passed j
it successfully through the Nevada Bank
with the assistance of Creegan and Dean,
and how the banking world had stamped
ed when the forgery was discovered in the
clearing house. He then told of the arrest
of the principals; how Dean had turned
State's evidence; about the trial of Becker
and Creegan, their conviction and sen
tence to life imprisonment.
Next he referred to the reversal of the
judgment against the prisoners by the Su
preme Court for lack of evidence corrobo
rating that given by Dean against his
"pals," and concluded by asking the court
to deal leniently with the prisoner, as he
had upon the opening of the last trial,
agreed to turn States evidence with Dean,
thereby furnishing the prosecution with
the necessary corroborative evidence and
assuring the conviction of Becker, the
man as District Attorney Murphy said,
who had "for years shaken the very
foundation of the banking world."
At the conclusion of District Attorney
Murphy's address the court asked if
such leniency would be agreeable to spe
cial counsel for the prosecution and the
Bankers' Association. Upon the state
ment that the request of the District At
torney for Jeniency for the prisoner was
made with the approval of the Bankers
Association and special counsel the court
then passed sentence and Creegan was
taken away to start upon his trip to the
convict's horror, Folsom Prison
Dean was overjoyed when notified that
his long term of confinement in the City
Prison was at an end, and felt like a
new man as he breathed the pure air
once again.
"It has come upon me so utterly unex
pected " he said as he stood outside the
prison, "that I can hardly realize that 1
am a free man* yet. Captain Seymour
told me a few days ago that I might
look forward to being discharged to-day,
but I have had so many disappointments
that f did not place much reliance in the
news. . ..
"I have been over three years in the
prison and I must say that I have noth
ing but feelings of kindness for the offi
cials for the manner in which I have
been treated, and I hope that I will be
kindly remembered by them.
"I have no definite plans for the future.
I like San Francisco and think that it is
the place for a man to live in with a
moderate income, but I want to get back
to New York just as soon as arrange
ments can be made for my transporta
tion I don't suppose that I will ever be
a good man, but I will never be so 'cuss
ed' bad as I have been."
Dean has made many friends during his
Incarceration in the prison and he was
warmly congratulated by many of them
who met him on Market street after his
release He was always courteous and
affable to visitors, and being a connois
seur on tea he was always ready to in
vite them to partake of his brew. He
helped in a good many ways also to make
the work of the prison officials lighter
and they say they will miss him.
He and Joseph McC'losker were brought
from Minnesota on March 12. 1896. by Cap
tain Seymour, and since then Dean has
been confined in the prison.

DIVINE HEALER.
BEDETED
AFTER MANY
LONG YEARS
Remarkable Meeting of
Husband and Wife in
Healer Truth's
Parlors.
/ . _
Both Were 111, and Met by
.Chance After a Separation
of Over Twenty Years.
NOW WELL AND HAPPY
One of the Many Incidents of the Remarkabis
Work Being Accomplished By Healer
Francis Truth at 440 Geary Street.
Absent Cures.
Life is full of startling surprises and
J every day events are occurring which
'awaken the thoughtless to reflection
and afford the romantic opportunities
for indulging in their pastime of study-
i ing the cause -and effect of mundane
happenings.
A few days ago the strange reunion
of a couple who had been separated for
twenty years occurred in the parlors
of Francis Truth, the remarkable heal-
er, at 440 Geary street. Suffering from
ills of long standing and attracted to
Healer Truth by the newspaper ac-
counts of his marvelous victories over
disease, this couple chanced to cross his
1 threshold almost at the same moment.
The husband, afflicted with sciatica,
| sustained himself by crutches; the
! wife, suffering from organic troubles
i and an affection of the knee joints, was
â¢ obliged to use a cane. Both made prog-
ress with difficulty.
Seated side by side and awaiting their
turn to see Healer Truth, the strangely
reunited couple began a conversation,
which resulted in the discovery of their
relationship.' The extravagant joy dis-
played by them as they fell into each
other's arms affected the onlookers
with surprise, and, when they learned
all, with tears of sympathy and joy.
The couple declined to give their
names, and they are known to none but
Healer Truth, who is pledged to se-
crecy. "It was a happy reunion," he
! said to a reporter yesterday; "but for a
time at least I must remain silent con-
cerning it. Both are patients of mine,
and both will in a few days be cured
and able to return to their home in the
I East."
From other sources it was learned
that the couple lived in New Hamp-
shire twenty years ago, when the hus-
band came West to make his fortune.
Ashanled to acknowledge his disap-
pointments, the husband did not write
to his wife for nearly two years. Then
she heard a report of his death. By a
coincidence the husband was informed
that his wife also had died suddenly.
The husband then came to California
and spent many years on the Comstock
lode. Subsequently the supposed widow
came to this city, and for several years
conducted dressmaking â  parlors on
Geary street. Illness crept upon both,
and by a combination of circumstances
they were simultaneously led to Healer
Truth's parlors, where their reunion
occurred as narrated.
This is not the only strange event
that is connected with the career of
Healer Truth in this city. His achieve-
ments have been and are now the won-
der of the medical men everywhere. His
cures, effected in the mildest manner,
are in many respects marvelous. Pa-
tients who were for years hopeless crip-
ples have thrown away their crutches
after their first treatment at his hands.
Persons who were totally blind have
rejoiced In a complete restoration of
their sight. Opium fiends, men with
lost vitality, women who for years suf-
fered from debilitating weakness have
cause to rejoice at the fate that brought
them in contact with Healer Truth.
Many persons who have been cured
recently, and not a few who have been
mentioned in the press, have objected
to the use of their names, for the rea-
son that they have been annoyed by
numberless visitors who called upon
them for a verification of Healer
Truth's cures. For this cause many
have requested that their names be
withheld from publication. Among-
these last week was one woman cured
of female weakness of eighteen years'
standing, another of goitre, several
cases of nasal catarrh, one of . catarrh
of the stomach, several of lost vitality
and one of a terrible skin disease given
up by other physicians. Mrs. M. J. De-
boise of 2127 Mission street, who was a
victim of hip disease, was. after a few-
treatments, radically cured, and she has
discarded her crutches. Miss Dora
Gardmeyer, formerly of 216 O'Farrell
street, but now residing in Livermore,
Cal., could not hear herself talk for
years, and was losing her power of
speech when she met Healer Truth. In
less than six treatments she was.. to her
great joy, permanently cured.
The absent cures of Healer Truth
continue to increase in number. With
every mail come the assurances of his
victories over disease of long standing
which had become chronic. Hundreds
of letters are received daily from all
parts of the country asking for terms,
methods of treatment, etc. These com-
munications are treated with the strict-
est confidence, and not a single com-
plaint has thus far been heard. Mean-
while Healer Truth's offices are the
Mecca of unfortunates of every walk of
life, and the results to all have been
highly gratifying. Not a single failure
thus far has been scored â¢by Healer
Truth â a record unequaled by any
medical practitioner in the State. Hun-
dreds of unfortunate poor have been
treated free of charge with astonishing
; results. ' -.

c-udge Greene Intimates That There
Have Been Many Grave Irreg

Contract.
Oakland OffW San Francisco Call,
adway, March 25.
: ; The contract for the dredging of Lake
.Merriu. awarded by the city to O. P.
Johnson, last November, may be declared
.fevalid and the work stopped. Such at
â¢Vr.ast was the serious intimation given by
â judge Greene late this afternoon in the
.-ircandamus suit instituted by Contractor
'Johnson to compel City Treasurer Gilpin
to pay the first partial payment for ihe
. hedging.
.". The demurrer of City Treasurer Gilpin,
Setting forth that the proceedings before
â¢jttie City Council and Board of Public
VTorks in awarding the contract were not
.regular, was up before Judge Greene for
â¢farther argument to-day, it having been
irgued last Wednesday by Attorney J.
.â C. Bates, in intervention tor F. W. Ru
pert, who originally sought an injunction.
: both City Attorney Dow and Attorney
â Oritge DeGolia on behalf of Contractor
"â¢.jjohnson are seeking to have the demur
rer, overruled. Thus, while it appears
Yon the face to be a three-cornered legal
iattle the merits and demerits of the
-contract and all proceedings that led up
'â /to !t were discussed. -
y - Attorney Bates contended that under
[â¢'section S3 of the city charter no partial
nvavments are permitted in the case at
â¢.liar- ar.d further, that no plans were ever
adopted on which bids for the work were-
Invited: also that changes in the contract
were made after the award; and that the
â¢b f d of Johnson never was accepted; nor
the contract awarded within twenty days
after the opening of the bids, as also re
quired by the charter.
Judge Greene, though announcing that
he would hear further arguments one
week from next Monday, said in summing
up the contentions advanced thus far:
"\s to partial payments in this case.
if you make them you must disregard the
latter part of section S3 of the city char
ter which provides that if such payments
are made the contract is void and the con
tractor receive nothing. Now, suppose,
â¢however, partial payments are made and
the contract never completed, what reme
dy has the city?
""On October 17. 1898. bids were opened
and on November 4 following the board
met again and passed resolutions reject
ing the Quinby bid and awarding the con
tract to Johnson, who had presented two
bidÂ«. Now, under which was the contract
awarded? In reality Johnson's bid was
not accepted.". ,
Judge Greene was also inclined to re
gard the lapse of twenty days after
opening of bids before the award as
being serious; also the fact that no
plans had 'been previously adopted. The
â¢ changes made in the specifications subse
quent to the award he regarded as seri
ously impairing the contract. - â  â 
â¢ Judge Greene in conclusion sain that tie
â¢would withhold- his decision untÂ« further
argument had been offered.
Attorney de Golia remarked that he de
sired an early' ruling. "If we have no
â¢ right to go ahead we want to stop work
â 'on. the lake." said the attorney. But
Judge Greene could not be hastened. "I
never decide a case in a hurry." said his
Honor, "and I never consider whose pock
et \s involved." Th" matter accordingly
went over until April 3.

merchants, and Frank Gowell is the son
of a capitalist who Is generally credited
â with being very nearly the level of a mil
lionaire. Two months have elapsed since
the marriage, but it has only just been
made known. It was very carefully
planned. Miss Champlin has a ma
sister Irving near Healdsburg and- she
wont on a visit to that town. Mr. Gowell.

elopement, met her there and one aftf-r

ty, and a Methodist minister weddc-d
Shortly afterward Gowell telegraphed
his mother of the elopement and Mrs.
Gowell told Mr. Champlin, the bride's fa
ther, but has rot yet told young Gowell'.s
father. Upon the return of the young
couple everybody was sworn to secrecy.
The young lady went back to her father s
home, while young Gowell returned to his
parents.
Recently the news of the wedding came
to Oakland from Fairneld and the parties
were forced to admit the truth.
â¢ -. I suppose you ran call it an elope
ment." paid Mrs. Gowell. who La a
in Oakland society. "Nun.' ot as knew
about it until it was all over. They are
just silly young people and we decided not
to make "the matter public. Mr. Gowell
! objected strongly to the match, but I do
\ not feel called upon to go into family
I affairs. As far as the girl was concerned
! there were, no obstacles in the way of
Frank marrying her if he so desired, but
I did not approve of the manner in which
they were married. They have been com
panions for three years."
Mr. Champlin takes the affair very phil
osophically and says that had they askea
permission first they could have obtained
it. Mrs. Gowell Sr. evidently does not be
lieve In early marriages, for these "silly
young people are" are both 24 years old.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 20, 1899.
MURDERED BY
THE INSURGENTS
NEAR MANILA
Young Huber Dies a
Hero's Death.
HIS BODY CUT TO PIECES
A RED CBOSS NURSE WHO
ACTED AS A SPY.
No Official Advice of His Death Has
Yet Been Given Out by the
War Department
Officials.
Oakland. Office San Francisco Call,
Ms Broadway, March 25.
Harry Huber, a member of the hospital
corps at Manila, has suffered a fearful
â¢death at the hand.-? of the insurgents, ac
cording to private advices received in this
city.
Fred Gatter of lower Broadway re-
rpived a letter to-day from his brother, in
which he says: "You remember the
young fellow who hung advertisements
in the cars at Eighth and Broadway. His
name was Harry Huber. He came out
with us, you know. Two weeks ago he
went to the insurgent lines as an Eng
lishman and \yas taken prisoner. A re
port came in that his body was found
cut to pier-op. 1 wish you would lot his
father know. This report is no doubt
true, and especially so because of this
fighting. I wish you would do this for
me, as the boy was a friend of mine and
a member of the hospital corps in the
National Guard at the same time I was."
Huber is the son of C. O. Huher, the
advertising agent who lives in this city.
The boy was 20 years old and lived in
Oakland all his life. When war broke
out he enlisted and was among the first
to go to Manila. He acted as a Red Cross
nurse and several times went within the
I insurgent camps under disguise. Some
! time ago ho sent his father two swords
which he had taken from a Filipino camp.
Huber gained considerable information
about the insurgents' movements, though
it is not known whether he was commis
sioned as an American spy.
"t hopÂ»Â» this information is not true,"
paid Huber's father this afternoon, "but
my boy was of an adventurous disposi
i tion, and this report soems to fit- his case
! exactly. I havo not heard from him for
some weeks and think it strange that i.o
! report of his death has come through the
j war office, because every day we see com
i plete lists of killed and wounded. I know
nothing more th;tn is contained in the let
ter to Mr. Gatter."
In a recent letter to his mother Harry
Huber told of an exciting experience he
had on January 15, and which bears
out the story of the letter received to
day.
Huber says that on the date mentioned
he borrowed a golf cap and a civilian's
coat, and with a canirade in citizen's
clothes, passed himself off as an English
man. Together the two young- men drove
to Fort Malate, looked around, took pho
tographs, got some rock specimens from
the hole where Dewey's shells pierced a
wall and killed a score of Spaniards.
passed the American guards, passed the
insurgent lines and then returned.
On the way back they were stopped by
an insurgent captain and accused of be
ing Americans. The driver of the kalisc
swore that they were Englishmen and
! they were allowed to pass.
Young Huber also sent his parents an
i old Spanish daggf-r in a primitive hilt and
a cavalier's sword of the fifteenth cen
tury. It seems reasonable to suppose that
Huber, emboldened by the success of
i which he wrote, attempted the task once
JOINT WILL DISPOSES
OF VALUABLE ESTATE
OAKLAND, March 25.â The olographic will of Carl Bruntsch, who died
Jn Alameda last Sunday, was Hied for probate to-day by Clementina
Bruntsch. widow of deceased. The will, a Joint instrument, is most
unique, yet very simple, in that the little sheet on which it is written
also contains the will of the widow, both dated Alameda, January 3, 1898. It
reads:
"This is my last will and testament. I give everything I own or possess to
my dear -wife, Clementina Bruntseh, in order that her income may remain
unimpaired and she thus be enabled to better care for our childrenâMargar
etta Ernst, Herbert, Carl, Tosca and Harold. Witness my hand:
"CARL BRUNTSCH."
Beneath this appears the will of Mrs. Bruntsch, similar in every particu
lar, except the substitution of the proper names, she bequeathing everything
to her husband.
The estate is estimated valued about $20,000, consisting of cash, bonds and
real estate in Alameda and San -Francisco. The widow petitions that letters
of administration be granted to her.

of being suspected of being a spy.
UNIVERSITY OF
CALIFORNIA NEWS
Arrangement Made to Hold the Next
Intercollegiate Field Day on
the Berkeley Campus.
BERKELEY. March 35.â Track Mana
gers P. J. Franklin of California and
Richard Culver of Stanford have .con
cluded to hold the next intercollegiate
track meet here. They reached this de
cision to-day.
That Berkeley should be the scene of
the next contest between the track teams
of the two universities marks an innova
tion in intercollegiate athletics. It is
without doubt the first time in the annual
events between the blue and gold and the
cardinal that one team has had to meet
another on its home field. The point is
an important one, as some advantage 01
-ity lies with men who race in tneir
own training quarters. As far as possi
ble though, a system will be arranged
whereby this advantage may be made to
alternate between the two colleges. By
holding the event one year at Berkeley
and the year following at Stanford the
difficulty can be avoided. It is understood
that the two managers intend to make
this agreement.
The innovation became necessary when
the track officials found that no place
could be had in San Francisco suitable
for the occasion. The old Olympic track,
on which previous field days have been
held, is not available this year. Stantord
immediately made overtures to have the
me-H on the Stanford campus, but Berke
ley" seemed the more convenient, and a
conference between the two managers
settled that it should be here.
A recent decision of the executive com
mittee of the Athletic Association appro
priated a sum of $175 for fencing in the
track on the campus. This will be the
first step toward preparing the grounds
for the next field day, which is to be held
\pril â ** Arrangements will be made at
once for the erection of bleachers in or
der to provide seating capacity sufficient
for the immense crowds whi,ch always
attend.
BIG ASSESSMENT
LEVIED ON STOCK
THE REALTY SYNDICATE WILL
STRENGTHEN ITSELF.
The New Law Places It Under the
Supervision of the State Bank
Commission.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 23,
The Realty Syndicate has. created some
purprise by assessing its stock $30 a share,
which is really fully paid up to the ex
tent of Its issue. The syndicate held a
meeting to-day and decided on the assess
ment. Although capitalized for $5,000,000
only 1700 shares at $100 apiece have been
issued. The assessment will produce
$340,000.
The Realty Syndicate is in the nature
of a banking business. It controls the
street railroads of this city and has enor
mous holdings of land. For the past two
years it has been taking small invest
ments and guaranteeing payment of 6
per cent to the investors. A little circu
lar printed on the blocks of tickets sold
by the street railroad companies outlines
the benefits to be derived from this sys
tem Hundreds of small investors took
advantage of the opportunity to obtain
the high rate of interest offered.
The late Legislature passed a law which
has for its object the placing of invest
ment companies such as the Realty Syn
dicate under the supervision of the Bank
Commission. This will necessitate the
periodical supervision of the condition of
thp syndicate's funds by the Bank Com
missioners and the directors to-day stated
that they welcomed the change.
The directors declare that the $340,000
is to be used for paying off floating in
debtedness and to otherwise improve the
financial standing of the big corporation.
This assessment -will not affect the hold
ers of certificates of investment, which
have been issued to small investors to the
rXtfnt of nbont $1,000,000, but will have
the effect of improving the security. The
holders of investment certificates live all
over the world, as they have been sold In
the Hawaiian Islands and the East for
the purpose of bringing money here to In
vest in Oakland.
The syndicate is anxious to establish its
proposed ferry from Emeryville to Son
Francisco, but at to-day's meeting it was
stated that there is nothing new in the
proposition, although all the schemes of
the corporation are being gradually devel
oped. ________________
NO DANGER NOW
OF A BIG FLOOD
A CEMETERY OFFICIAL SAYS
DAMS ARE STRONG.
While the Storm Was at Its Height
He Was Not so Self-
Assured.
Oakland Office Fnn Francipco Call,
908 Broadway, March 25.
Superintendent A. D. Smith says that
the alarm In regard to the Mountain
View Cemetery reservoirs was simply a
cry of "Wolf." He now pays that the
alarm and anxiety wre unnecessary,
and that now there is no possibility of
danger.
."Some ill-advised individual who could
have known nothing whatever of the con
structions of our dams reported to the
Chief of Police that the dams were about
to hurst," he said to-day. "The Chief sent
warning to all the people to move out at
once, and in doing so fulfilled his duty.
We had arranged in capo of any possibil
ity of flood to give ample warning to
everybody living along the line of the
stTv.-im. Had the storm continued during
Thursday night, we should have been ex
tremely anxious, but a large gang of
skillful workmen was constantly on the
dams during the entire night, and every
thing was able to stand any possibU
strain. The dams were constructed to
meet JiiPt such an emergency, and have
withstood a most crucial test."
The superintendent gave his interview
while the sun waa shining and w'nTTe nine
siphons were running the surplus water
nut of the reservoir. On Thursday night,
when the greatest danger threatened, and
when the rain waa falling heavily. Super
intendent Smith did not talk so reassur
ingly. #
A Plumber's Narrow Escape.
OAKLAND, March 25.â "William John
son, a plumber residing at IS2B Grove
street, came within less than half an inch
of losing his life to-day. As it is, he may
lose the sight of his right eye. Johnson
was at work in a trench when a co-labor
er accidentally struck him in the eye with
the point of a pick, resulting in an abra-
Pion of the cornea and a lacerated con
junction (inner portion). Drs. Stratton
and Rowe, at the Receiving Hospital, at
tended the injured man and united the
conjunction with two stitches. The doc
tors have hopes that the eye may yet be

| SPECIALTY CHRONIC DISEASES J
FOR THE BLOOD, LIVER, LUNGS.
Advanced Medical Science knows of no more
powerful alterative medicine than Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery. Alterative medicines,
so-called because they alter or change the condition
of the system, have ranked among the most valued
of medicines prescribed by physicians. It is by the
skillful and scientific combination of several such
alteratives that Dr. Pierce has produced an altera-
tive remedy, having the specific value of each in-
gredient and the combined and concentrated power
of all these alteratives in union, which are so
blended and so balanced, that they unite the great-
est delicacy of operation with the utmost healing
power. It is these facts which give this greatest
of alteratives a genuine claim to the title of a
"Discovery."
The action of ' ' Golden Medical Discovery is
primarily directed to the stomach and the nutritive
or digestive system. Here is a common starting
place of disease.
What "Weak Stomach" NUana.
There never was a strong man with a "weak
stomach." And a so-called weak stomach may
and often does mean weak heart, weak liver or weak
lungs. Why? Because in the stomach the nour-
ishment for each organ of the body is prepared, and
from the stomach it is distributed. Bread kneaded
in a sour trough will take on the taint of the trough.
Food mixed and prepared in a tainted stomach will
tal the taint and poison of that stomach all over
the system, to finally lodge at the weakest point of
some weak organ. Hence it is that in curing the
stomach and other organs of digestion and nutri-
tion, and in increasing the activity of the blood-
making glands, ' ' Golden Medical Discovery 'â  ' at
once begins to send throughout the body an in-
creased supply of pure blood, because the blood is
made from the food taken into the stomach, and
with the â  ' weak stomach made strong and foul
blood made pure, comes a change to other organs
which gather strength to throw off disease.
' ' Golden Medical Discovery works with Nature ;
it puts into Nature's hand the only weapon with
which she can fight disease.
SIXTEEN YEARS OF SUFFERING.
The power of the ' ' Discovery is best exempli-
fied in its cures of chronic cases, where after years
of suffering, and when doctors had utterly failed to
help, Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery has
made a perfect and permanent cure. Such a case is
that of Mrs. Suggs.
" For the past sixteen years I have had torpid liver and indi-
gestion and tried many doctors and patent medicines but I could
not get a care," writes Mrs. Simeon Suggs, of Clyde, Sabine
Parish, La. "Three montbs ago I thought I would try Dr. R. V.
Pierces Golden Medical Discovery and his ' Pleasant Peilets.' I
got six bottles of each and I received a good result in a week,
and to-day I am cured sound and well. The symptoms were
coated tonoTie, speck 3 before the eyes, disposed to be cross and
irritable, foul stomach, bad taste in mouth, tired feeling, a feel-
ing of fear or dread, headache, yellow skin, etc. These symp-
toms did not all appear at once."
There are thousands of people struggling along
day after day, handicapped by disease who could be
made healthy and happy by the use of ' ' Golden
Medical Discovery." It has cured ninety-eight
people in every hundred who have given it a fair

the complaint recently placed on record
by Mr. Botkin, and in this answer she
sets up what is said to be a valid defense
to the action for divorce directed against
her.
A few weeks ago Mr. Botkirf brought
suit against the condemned murderess
for a divorce on the ground that the de
fendant had been convicted of a felony.
He alleged that she had been tried and
convicted of the murder of Mrs. John P.
Dunning, and under such conviction had
been sentenced to State's Prison for the
term of her natural life.
As to these allegations Mrs. Botkin en
ters a general denial, and to support her
contention that she has a valid defense
she asks the court to grant her alimony
and counsel fees sufficient to enable her
to prosecute her interests to the end. In
addition to the general denial Mrs. Bot
kin makes a defense as follow.-:
On the 10th day of November, 1*37, in the
Superior Court of the city and county of
San Francisco, there was filed an alleged
indictment by the Grand Jury against
Ha Botkin, by which indictment the
Grand Jury accused the defendant of the
crime of murder, committed, as was and is
alleged in the indictment, in Dover, Dela
ware, and therein was alleged that Cordelia
Botkin had administer one Mary
Elizabeth Dunning, otherwise known as
MrÂ«. John P. Dunning.
The defendant was thereafter tried for
the alleged crime in the Superior Court of
this city, and upon the conclusion of th<*
trial the jury rendered a verdWt upon the
indictment mentioned, finding the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree ami
fixed her punishment at imprisonment for
life.
Within the time allowed by law the de
fendant moved for a new trial and also
n v-<l an arfest of the judgment to be
entered on the verdict. The Court there
upon made and entered an order denying
h. .th motions. Subsequently the court pro
nounced sentence upon the verdict, and
thereupon sentenced the defendant to a term
of imprisonment in the State's* prison in
San Quentin tor the term of her natural
life.
Within the time allowed for law by such
purposes the defendant served and filed
net* notice- of appeal from the Judgment.
The court thereafter, and on application
by the defendant, made and entered â¢ Its
order staying the execution of the judgment,
and the execution of the Judgment at the
time of tjfe -commencement of the action
instituted by Welcome A. Bptkin for di
vorce was and now is stayed. The appeal
so taken is now pending in the Supreme
Court.
The defendant in this action is advised
and believes ' that the Judgment rendered
and faithful trial. The trouble is that so many of
these people have become hopeless. They have
dribbled away the savings of years iv doctors' fees,
and without any improvement. They are fixed in
the belief that their cases are a little different from
anybody's else. And those are the very people that
' ' Discovery " cures. It's the people whose diseases
are just a little different, and who are given up by
doctors, the people whose diseases are chronic, and
who try "Golden Medical Discovery" as a last
resort, that form the bulk of that great army of the
cured which numbers o\*er half-a-million persons.
It is absolutely impossible to have a strong body
where there is a " weak stomach or good health
where there is bad blood. The use of the ' ' Dis-
covery " raa V be an experiment with you, but the
experience of others surely warrants the experiment.
"I can say honestly that Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Dis-
covery is the greatest medicine ever compounded for purifying-
the blood," writes Miss Annie Wells, of Fergusson's Wharf,
Isle of Wight Co., Va. "I suffered terribly with rheumatism,
and pimples on the skin and swelling in my knees and feet so
that I could not walk. I spent about twenty dollars paying doc-
tors' bills but received no benefit. About a year ago I decided
to try Dr. Pierce'-i Golden Medical Discovery and 'Favorite
Prescription, 1 and am entirely cured."
But the most remarkable feature of the cures
produced by the use of "Golden Medical Discov-
ery ' ' is where the lungs are ' ' weak. ' '
Proof Positive.
Here is found fullest demonstration pf the theory
that if you can supply Nature with the needed
nourishment she will build up the waste places of
the body into health and wholeness. And here
again it is proved that, the " Discovery " does sup-
ply in the most perfect form that nourishment which
Nature uses to effectually renew the broken down
organs of the body. Those who have suffered with
obstinate coughs, hemorrhages, bronchial affections,
emaciation, night sweats, weakness, and like condi-
tions which when neglected or improperly treated
end in consumption, have found in Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery perfect health.
"Last spring I was taken with severe pains in my chest, and
wti so weak I could hardly walk about the house." says Mrs.
G. E. Kerr, of Fort Dodge, Webster Co., lowa. " I tried several
physicians and they told me I had consumption. I heard of
Dr. Pierces Golden' Medical Discovery and I thought I would
try some of it Before I had taken the first bottle I was very
much better ; I took five bottles of it and have not yet had any
return of the trouble."
"^After using about five bottles of Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery my boy seems to be all right," writes Mr. J. W. Price,
of Ozark, Monroe Co., Ohio. "He was very bad when I com-
menced to give him the 'Golden Medical Discovery.' The doc-
tors claimed be had consumption and we doctored with them
until he was past walking. It has been ten mouths since he
stopped taking your medicine and he is still in good health.
We are very thankful to you for saving our son."
"Last spring I wrote you in regard to my health which at that
time was. very poor," writes Mrs. Mettie M. Barnes, of Garfield,
Pawnee Co., Kansas. "My trouble was bronchial affection.
Symptoms, spitting of blood almost every morning for five
years, shortness of breath, raw and sore throat, loss of strength,
at times almost loss of voice, irregular periods â in fact I thought
I was surely going into consumption. We lived in Ohio when I
consulted you. You advised me to give Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery a trial, which I did, and with happy results.
I got two bottles just before we started for Kansas. I did not
feel as if I ever would get there, but we arrived and I used the
two bottles of ' Golden Medical Discovery ' and health returned
as I used the medicine. I have only raised blood three times
since I began using it. My periods are regular, strength re-
turned, and lam almost a new person. I have all faith in Dr.
Pierces medicine. I know ofa lady that was cured of consump-
tion by this same 'Golden Medical Discovery,' and she always
sings its praise."
and entered against her in the Superior
Court is not now and never has been a floal
Judgment, and in consequence the defend
ant at the time of the commencement of
this action, was not and had not been
convicted of a felony. Defendant is further
advised and believes that the appeal from
the judgment suspended and set aside us
operation and effect, and, therefore, the
plaintiff n.-iiuireÂ«l no right of action by
rea* n of the entry of the judgment ap-
pealed, from. "â . -â "â â  â . : /.
? In consequence defendant alleges that the
plaintiff ouxht not to maintain this .action
because of all the matters set forth in this
complaint. In the notice of motion for
alimony and its accompanying affidavit
Mrs Botkin says "the plaintiff has not paid
her any money to defray the expenses or
defending the alt against her. nor has he
paid anything since the commencement of
the suit, nor for a long time prior thereto,
for her support and maintenance. *urtner
more, defendant is absolutely wH
means, money or property to pay the cost.
charges and expenses of this suit directed
against her. Until recently the plaintiff
was engazed in the- grain business in
. Stockton and in receipt of an income, while
large, the exact amount the defendant is
unable to state. Botkin sold his business
during the month of December, IS9S. and
realized, bo the defendant is informed ana
believe?, the sum of $5000. â . .
Mr. Botkin is a capable man of business
and at the time of his marriage he was and
at present is a man of means and able to
make money through his industry and abil
ity. The plaintiff is able financially to pay
the defendant as alimony, pendente lite,
the sum of ?150 and the additional sum or
J2SO for counsel fees, and she is advised that
these sums are reasonable, considering thÂ«
financial ability of . the plaintiff, and, the
work and services to be performed in tne
proper defense of this -action.
Such is the defense and collateral issue
brought up by Mrs. Botkin to defeat the
effort of her husband to secure a divorce.
It is the opinion of well-informed mem
bers of the bar that her defense is good
until such time as the Supreme Court
shall have passed on the validity of the
Judgment pronounced against her: out it
the Supreme Court should hold that the
judgment Is valid then her defense will
avail her nothing and Botkin will be
freed. â¢ V

GAGE WILL SWING
THE LASH OF POWER
Democrats Likely to Lose the Pat=
ronage of Both Prisons.
The Governor Threatens to Remove a Director If
Aguirre Is Not Elected Warden â A Merry War
of Officials at San Quentin.
The lash with which tfie Democrats
hoped to whip Governor Oage out of
his path as a spoilsman will in all
probability be used upon their own
backs. It is probable that the Demo
crats will not only be whipped into
submission, but they will also find
themselves minus the little StatÂ»> pa
tronage they now enjoy. When they
used the State Board of Prison Direct
ors as a bludsreon with which to re
taliate upon Gage and Burns for their
interference in water-front affairs they
seized upon a dangerous weapon. From
whatever point of view one may look
at least one of the Democratic mem
bers of the Board of Prison Directors
holds his office without authority of
law and may be removed at the pleas
ure of the Governor. With a scratch of
the pen Gage may turn the Democratic
majority in the board into a minority,
and may not only retain the patronage
of San Quentin Prison, but seize that
of Folsom as well. This unexpected
development of the pint of the Demo
crats bus created rvirked excitement in
political circles.
The Board of Prison Directors mot
yestorday to discuss the affair, particu
larly as Governor Gape has plainly in
timated that one of tho Directors must i
gr> it" tho Board of Directors does not
appoint M. J. Aguirre to succeed Hale |
as Warden of San Quentin. The lash
is in Gage's hanrl now, and he has no
particular hesitancy in using it. He is
determined to place his I>s Angles
favorite in a good position, and. as far
as the politicians ran see. he will suc
ceed. Gage's first and most powerful
weapon Is a lesral one. To reinforce
this he hns the sraxirlal and the quar
rels of the present administration at
San Quentin.
The law requires that the Governor
shall appoint Prison Directors as va
cancies occur. Mark D. Ivory was ap
pointed in 1592 by Governor Markham
to succeed Charles Sonntasr on the
board about eighteen months before
there was an actual vacancy. When
Governor Budd took his seat he re
ferred the matter to Attorney General
Fitzgerald for his decision. The Attor
ney < Joneral furnished a written opinion
that the Governor could appoint a Di
rector only at the end of his predeces
sor's term, when an actual vacancy ex
isted. On the strength of this opinion
Governor Budd disregarded Ivory's
appointment and appointed R. M.
Fitzperald of Oakland to tho position.
It was only a short time, however,
until the Governor reversed himsolf
and appointed Don Ray oZ Gait in 1597
to succeed E. J. De Pue nearly a year
beforo the latter's term expired.
This action was directly contrary to
the opinion of Attorney General Fitz
gerald and the belief the Governor
himself had formerly entertained. Now
it is contended that one of the ap
pointments must be wrong. If the At
torney General's opinion will stand the
test of law, Ray has no legal ri^ht to
hold the position; if it is not. then
Ivory is entitled to the seat of Fitz
gerald.
It is known that Gage has had this
card up his sleeve for some time, but
he did not intend to play it until he
was ready. The intention of the Demo
crats to retaliate upon him, however,
has alarmed him and his corps of con
fidential advisers to the extent that
they intend to anticipate any proposed
scheme of revenge. Accordingly it is
given out on good authority, the time
for electing a new Warden being on
April 8, that prior to that time the
question will be pushed to an issue. If
possible one of the Directors will be
ousted before the date in question and
a Republican placed in his position.
That Governor Gage is alarmed over
the turn in affairs there can be no
doubt, for tho prison patronage has
been an object of great concern to him.
Not only does he wish to control the
patronage, but he desires to see Warden
Hale relegated to private life. Hale
and Gape are not on good terms and
have not been since the Warden paid
a visit to Sacramento during the early
part of the legislative session. Hale
went up with colors flying and came
back in an angry mood, which lasted
for over a week.
It seems that a year or two ago the
Board of Prison Directors adopted an
order that none of the guards at San
Quentin should be permitted to visit
any of the saloons of the village. Two
saloons have been conducted for a long
time within a hundred yards of the
prison gates in direct deiiance of the
law, which provides that none shal] be
allowed within two miles of a State
institution. One of these saloons, be
longing to J. F. Robinson, a former
guard, received the bulk of the patron
age, and a large number of guards have
been accustomed to congregate in the
rear room of the "grocery" and drink,
play games and have an all-round
"good time" to their hearts' content.
About once a year the Warden would
make a spasmodic attempt to restrain
the guards from patronizing the saloons
in question, but in a short while word
would be passed around among the
prison attaches that "tbe goose hung
high" and it was all right to go to
Robinson's.
When the Warden went to Sacra
mento some one had evidently given
Gage a "tip." The Warden was told
that these saloons were a disgrace to
San Quentin Prison and that he was
not doing his duty in letting them sell
liquor to the guards. He was informed
that he could soon end the affair by
forbidding the guards to .enter a saloon.
There were some other things said evi
dently not to Hale's liking, for he re
turned at white heat and at once in
formed the guards that any marl caught
trading at these "groceries" would be
discharged. Robinson made a great
ado and declared that his business was
THE SAN FBA^CISCO CALL, STINPAT, MARCH 26, 1899.
heincr ruined to further the Warden's
political ambition. He had several in-
terviews with the head of the prison,
but the latter remained inflexible.
Two weeks later the Warden rame to
Pan Francisco with the intention of re
pairing his political fences. He Earned
something thnt put him on the anxious
seat, for he found it necessary to make
several more visits. What he did or
F.-iirt nohody seems to know, but it was
only a short while before the guards
began to drift hack to the saloons
again. Now a casual visitor can droD
into the rear room of Robinson's at any
time and see the guards enjoying them
selves at the same old stand and in
the same old way.
That Gage has heard of this seems
certain In view of the fact that he re
cently approached a Director in this
city ami asked when- the next election
for a Warden was to be held. He was
told thai April R was the day, and in
return asserted that he intended to take
a hand In ih.^ same himself and wanted
to consult with the board prior to that
day. Tho saloon proposition affords a
legitimate excuse for the politicians
antagonistic to Halo, for a good many
guards have been discharged on ac
count of drunkenness and for going to
sleep on duty after imbibing too freely.
Again, prisoners have been released and
known to have spent all their money
in one or other of the plact s. with the
result that they reached this city pen
niless and soon found themselves be
hind the bars for vagrancy.
Gage is known to have promised
Martin Apuirro, a former Sheriff of Los
Angeles, the first vacancy in the war
denship, and the latter does not wish
to wait a year to become Warden of
Folsom.
Not only has tho aged hoad of San
Quontin prison had to worry over tho
antipathy shown him by Gage, but he
has other troubles of a nature border
ing on the domestic. Captain J. C. Ed
gar, who has charge of tho prison yard.
is at outs with tho Wardon and has
boon for two years. The troublo bo
twoon the two has rosultod in constant
clashing. Edgar has frequontly con
ducted himsolf toward Hale in such a
manner that he would have boon speed
ily consigned to another walk in life
wore it not for foar on the part of
TTalo th;!t ho would find the action a
boomerang.
Tho la tost instance of the contempt
Bhown by Captain Edgar for his su
porior Is tho mannor In which Hale
was "thrown down" beforo th^ convicts
who wore charged with conspiring tn
break out of tho ponitentiary and wore
cast Into tho dungoon. Hale now has
all tho credit â dubious as It ts â for be
ing duped by "Sir" Harry Westwood
Cooper, the cunning schemer who
planned to got himself a pardon by
playing the part of stool pigeon, hut
if common prison talk iB to "be taken
for anything Hale was not only fooled
by Coop.r but by Edgar as well.
This story, which has been traced
bark and found true in fact and in
d.tail, is to thÂ» effect that for all Hale
knew of the intended outbreak until
tho night the convicts were thrown into
tho dunereon, they might have mur
dorrd every guard in the prison, liber
ated all the prisoners and flooded the
State with a thousand criminals of the
most vicious character to be found in-
Pido the walls of a penitentiary.
Ton days before the intended out
broakâaccepting Cooper's tale as true â
Edgar received a confession from Cood
er. He said not a word to Warden
Hal", but held a conference w r ith Coop-
er every day. His idea in this was
plainly to take all the credit of cir
rumventing the conspiracy himsolf. and
he procee&ed with this end in view.
On thr- nieht the conspirators were
thought to be in a fair way to make
the intended break Edgar found that
the Warden must be notified, and go-
ing to him he acquainted him with the
state of affairs. Hale was naturally
furious that a subordinate had shown
such contempt for his authority, but
was in some measure mollified by the
statement of Edgar that he had with
held the facts from the Warden on ac
count of the ill-health of the latter and
did not want to see him worried until
the plan was nipped in the bud. Hale
immediately ordered the men placed in
solitary confinement.
When the next meeting of the Board
of Prison Directors w r as held Hale did
all he could to prevent Guard Shields
from getting a chance to exonerate
himself from the charge, by innuendo,
that he had aided in the plan of escape.
He tacitly admitted that he had been
bunkoed by Cooper by saying at that
meeting that he was going to put
Cooper in the dungeon with the others,
and thus gave Gage other reasons for
antagonizing him for re-election. But
the most significant fact was the ab
sence from the meeting of Captain Ed
gar, which prevented the conspiracy
from being investigated. Fortunately
for all concerned, Edgar was taken ill
a few days before the meeting, and
nothing could be done until April 8.
the day of the appointment of a new
Warden. Edgar is a personal friend
of Lieutenant Governor Jacob Neff.
who has stood behind him at all times.
It was for fear of the influence Neff
might exercise over Gage that
Hale did not make quick work of Ed
gar as soon as he found that he had
been fooled by the so-called conspiracy.
Between Gage's candidate for War
den, the impending struggle over the
ejection of a Democratic Director, the
mutual antipathy of Hale and Edgar
and the desire of the Democrats for
the patronage of the penitentiaries in
retaliation for Gage's attitude over
water front patronage, there's going to
be some merry politics between now
and April 8.

STATE AT PARIS

a Commissioner.
KOWALSKY'S HOPES VANISH
BURNS AND McLATTGHXIN ARE
INDIGNANT.
They Show Their Wrath at the Action
of the Governor â A Chapter
From Local Political
History.
Governor Henry T. Gaere has decided
to appoint M. H. de Young the official
representative and Commissioner from
California to the Paris Exposition.
This announcement will be a surprise
to many and a disappointment to some,
as the honor was eagerly souerht. It
has boen the ambition of Mr. dr> Young
to attend the Paris Exposition in an of
ficial capacity. He is well informed in
the duties of a commissioner and
sought first to represent the United
States Government at tho great expo
sition. The appointment of George \V.
Peck of Chicago to that important post
by President McKinley shattered, how
ever, the hopes of Mr. de Young in that
direction. He will therefore accept the
more modest but still distinguished po
sition of representative for California.
It Is perhaps a matter of loo a ! inter
est that 'the chief rival of Mr. de Young
for the place he will receive was Col
onel Henry I. Kowalsky, who, in hope
ful expectancy, hovered as gracefully
as his avoirdupois would permit around
the gubernatorial presence. The Gov
ernor was not impressed, however, with
the Kowalsky hover ings and the col
onel returned with neither hopo nor
promise from Sacramento. The prize
was for I>e Young.
The affair was all settled on Friday
afternoon. Governor Gage anrl De
Young met in conference and remained
in earnest discussion for something'
over an hour and a half. The news of
the unexpected mooting was not slow
in traveling. It was not long in reach
ing the ears of Colonel Dan Burns and
his faithful attendant. Major Frank Mc-
LaughHn. The colonel was horrified.
and in duty bound the major was
shocked. The colonel swore and the
major took his cue. The colonel gave

expression to several words not found
in a dictionary, and the major looked
around for a cuspidor.
The Governor had thrown them
down. He had gone deliberately into
the camp of the enemy to award his
gubernatorial favors. The colonel feels
as though. he possesses a proprietary
Interest in the Governor, at whose ac
tion he felt hurt. In deference to the
colonel the major expressed a sense of
injury, although he said, with charac
teristic emphasis, that he will follow
Mr. de Young wherever he goes, even
to Paris. The appointment of Mr. de
Young may be therefore the means of
satisfying the major's ambition, at
least one of them.
The anger of Dan Burns and the
sympathetic horror of McLaughlin at
the action of Governor Gage in decid
ing to honor De Young are connected
with some recent and very interesting
politic.il history. It will be remembered
that De Young was a candidate for
the United States Senatorship. It was
understood that in his candidacy he
had the support of the Southern Pa
cific Company and through that cor
poration the support of Dan Burns.
No secret was mado of the fact that the
Mexican was heartily in support of De
Young for Senator. That allegiance
was honestly given by the colonel as
long as the railroad people commanded
him to pivo it.
When the proper time came the rail
road people withdrew their support of
De Young and Burns naturally desert
ed him. Without a word of consulta
tion with De Young Burns set himself
up as a candidate for United States
Senator and De Young opened his box
of hammers. What followed is politi
cal history. Burns chafed under the
attack of De Young and vowed all sorts
of vengeance. That is a habit of the
colonel's, and in view of recent events
at the capital is perhaps pardonable.
Tli-' colonel sworo that as long as he
possessed a vestige of political influ
ence De Xoung would be punished.
And now at the very close of the sen
sational Senatorial campaign at Sac
ramento De Young receives a marked
honor from governor Gage. It is the
fixed conviction of the colonel, and
naturally of the major, that Governor
Gage has played fast and loose with
th.-ir affections and has delivered them
over to be the sport and the playthings
of their enemies.

Prima Donna and Im

SHE WILL SOON BE WITH GRAU
FAVORS HEAVY ROLES IN WAG
NERIAN OPERA.
Reception Tendered the Singer by
William Wolff Atteaded by
a Large Number of
Germans.
When oporatic quepns and impresarios
meet, one with a Krifvanre and the other
with a. determination to conquer, some
thins generally happens. Charles T. Ellis,
proprietor of the opera company which
bears his name, and Mrac. Gadski, the
German prlma donna, have clashed under
those conditions, and now Gad&ki is hap
py and Ellis is sad. Next season the Ger
man diva will not be found with Ellis,
although he had a contract with her that
called for the operatic* season of 189S-99.
The differences that arose between tho
parties resolved itself into a matter of
type. Melba, great and only, was starred.
She was the one bright luminary of tho
Ellis operatic constellation, according to
the Gadski version of affairs. Whenever
her name appeared in print it was In type
at least a half-inch deeper and two
shades blacker than that of Gadski, and
therefore the prima donna grieved and
was sad. But all this could be borne and
endured, though it was tantalizing in the
extreme. The final stroke came with tho
first performance of "Aida" in this city.
That was Gadski's role and she shone for
her brief three hours on the stage, mak
ing what many considered the success of
the season in this city. After this Gad
ski became jealous of her own fame and
with an offer from Grau dangling above
her head she began to make it unpleasant
for Ellis.
A few nights ago the meeting between
Gadskl and Ellis occurred. Gadski has
now her release with the reservation on
the part of Ellis that he may bid for her
services next year. In reality Gadski has
signed with Grau for the London season,
which begins on May 15 and* ends July
8. Grau, with the strongest operatic com
pany in this country, will star Gadski in
heavy German foles. The real reason of
Gadski's contretemps with Ellis seems
hinged on an offer from Grau for next
season. The small and shadowy colored
type merely accentuated Gadski's. con
firmed belief that she was not receiving
the full measure of her worth.
Mme. Gadski was . tendered a reception
and banquet last evening at the home of
"William Wolff, the commission merchant,
1312 Washington street. A number of the
prominent Germans of the city were pres
ent to meet the singer.
"When Mme. Gadski came to San Fran
cisco she voluntarily offered to give a con
cert for the benefit of some German or
ganization. , It was decided that the con
cert should, be held some time this week
and the proceeds were to be devoted to
the use of the Goethe-Schiller Mouhment
Association.
Owing to the fact that Mme. Gadski
is compelled to leave the city to-day the
arrangements for the proposed concert
had to be abandoned, but to show the ap
preciation her countrymen had for the
kind offer made by Mme. Gadski
Charles Bundschu, the president of the
Monument Association, composed a poem
to the lady. This was read at the ban
quet last nigr'H and an illuminated copy
of it presented to Mmc. Gaclaki.

hanging loosely from a bony frame. Often he is seen on the street
with a dark-eyed woman of olive complexion who still retains traces
of fierce Andalusian beauty. The pair are always accompanied by
two children, twins, who have inherited the features and eyes of their
mother. The four live in a. lodpinsr-hou'se and at times -they- are hard

The man is James A'ddison iPeralta> Reavis and â¢ the, â  â¢woman I? Wt
â¢wife. He planned and barely failed of executing the most gigantic, fraud
that was ever conceived against this Government. At one time he had a
fortune of millions within his grasp. Such famous men as Robert G. In
grersoll. Roscoe Conkling. Collis P. Huntingtoh; "William 8. Wood. Reuben
H. Lloyd, Phil B. Thompson, John W. Mackay. Ed S: Stokes, Bourke
Cockran. Charles Crocker. I. M. C. Curry and H. 1). Money espoused his
cause and helped fight hi.= cpse in the cnu>r.
In the end. when his scheme was on the verge of success, when he was
about to receive title from the Government to 12,500.000 acres of land
valued at $100,000,000, the Government succeeded in convicting him of con
spiracy to defraud the Government. His scheme was exploded and he
was sentenced to serve two years in a New Mexican prison. He served
his sentence.
A few days ago he wrote a confession of. the entire conspiracy. Ac
cording to his statements the Government, although it spent $100,000 in de
fending the case, never hit upon the real facts. His conviction, he says,
â was secured upon a mass of false and perjured testimony. He himself,
however, tells for the first time how he -conceived and executed the
fraud.
He tells how he met an Andalu-?lan girl whose parentage was un
known, how he man her and lilt about her a mythical lineage proving
that she was the descendant of one of the noblest families of Spain and
the sole heir to the Poralta [grant of Arizona. He tells how he
searched the archives of Spain and forged and stole ancient documents;
how he and his wife were received by royal and noble families, and how
he built up document by document a title to millions.

parents fought in . the revolution. I
was reared in Henry County. Mo. In
May, 1861, at the age of 18, I enlisted
in the Confederate army and during
my life as a soldier committed my first
crime. I forged an order and being
successful in this I raised a furlough,
and before this expired I surrendered
to the Union f<>r< â 
After the war I worked as a street
car conductor but subsequently opened
a real estate office in St. Louis. I was
successful in forging a title to sustain
a tax title to Borne valuable land I had
bought, not knowing the title was im
perfect. But these are incidents in
â which th^re is little interest. However,
success in these early evils sowed the
6eed that later sprang forth into the
most gigantic fraud of this century.
The plan to secure the Peralta grant
and defraud the Government out of
land valued at $100,000,000 was not con
-1 in a day. It was the result of a
series of crimes extending over nearly
a Kcore of years. At first the stake was
small, but it grew and grew in magni
tude until even I sometimes -was ap
palled at the thought of the possibili
ties. I was playing a game which to
â¢win meant greater wealth than that of
a Gould or a Vanderbilt. My hand con

pleaded my cause and unlimited capi

came absolutely confident of Mirv<--ss.
As I nearer! the verge of triumph I was
exultant and sure. Until the very mo
ment of my downfall I gave no thought
to failure. But my sins found me out
and as in the twinkle of an eye I saw
the millions which had seemed already
In my grasp fade away and heard the
courts doom me to a prison cell.
Now I am growing old and the thing
hangs upon me like a nightmare until
I am driven to make a clean breast of
it all, that I may end my days in peace.
The first I ever knew of the Peralta
prant was when Dr. George M. Will
ing walked Into my real estate office in
Ft. Louis and told me that he had a
land grant of fabulous proportions in
Arizona and wanted me to \ake hold of
it. After a number of Interviews I do
elded to give my whole time to the mat
ter.
Just as I wae about to ptart for the
West my health gave away completely
and I was forced to abandon the trip.
For two years I remained an invalid
at my father's home in Vernon County,
Mo. One night I had a dream that
warned me that I should start for Cali
fornia. I left immediately with scarce
ly any money and without preparations
for tho journey. Once in California mv
health improved and after two more
years I returned to my father's home
for my wife. She refused Â«yen to see
me and to appease my conscience I
placed what means I had accumulated

Four years had elapsed since I had
talked with Willing.
About this tim*> I received a letter
from Mrs. Willing: reciting the death
of her husband and proposing that I
resume the grant matter. I entered
into a contract with her and returned
to California. Here my money ran out
and I went to work on the Los An
geles Daily Star. Subsequently I work-
Ed on daily papers in Ran Francisco
and all the prominent extreme West

did not have the means to examine

I went immediately tb Arizona and
there, after much patient research and
a trip to Mexico, learned that the
Willing: title was purely mythical. The
way of it was this: October 20, 1864,
In Black Canyon, Yavapai County*. Ari
zona, there existed a mining camp, the
principal persons of the camp being
Dr. George M. Willing of St. Louis,
Don Antonio Pablo Peralta, his son
Miguel Peralta, Don Jose Ybarra, M.
Bernatto Guiness, Don Rafael Ma
chado, Don Manuel Ramon and
Charles Lovejoy, a friend of Willing.
Among these originated the idea of the
Peralta grant. Another mythical per
son executed a deed of this parole
grant to Dr. Willing, the paper recit
ine: that the grant had been ceded to
the father of the maker of the deed
by tho King of Spain for military serv
ices in 1158 and that he had been forc
ed to abandon it on account of hostile
Indians. It embraced 300 square
leagues of land located along the Gila
River, thirty leagues from east to west
by ten leagues wide, resting its western
border upon the eastern line of the
Pima reservation.
One of the alleged witnesses, M.
Bernatto Guineas, was a Frenchman
who afterward located in business in
I.os Angeles, Cal.. but died before he
explained. Ms part in the matter, as
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, MARCH 26, 1899.
flld also Don Antonio Pablo Peralta,
The only other Mexican, Don Rafael
MachadO of Rosario, Lower California,
affirmed that a Spaniard named Miguel
Peralta made the deed. The writing
was more that of Don Pablo, and he
suited the hero of Willing's tale bet
ter Than Miguel Peralta.
Willing represented that he had
given a^ pack train of sixteen mule?,
valued at $22,000, for the land. This re
cites in a nutshell all I could determine
about the grant.
Becoming certain that Pinalto. the
name given as the maker of the deed,
was a myth, I forged the documents
necessary to shift the title into the Pe
ralta family. Immediately the Peraltas
became so numerous that I realized
that a title in their names would never
do. After considering the matter sev
eral months I decided to again shift the
title into pome noble family of Spain
that had become extinct.
In the meantime I traveled much In
the towns where I could gain informa
tion concerning the men who might be
interested In this title. I talked with
old residents and stored my mind with
many incidents that proved of great
value in later years. But I will pass
quickly over this period and come down
to the time when the great fraud as it
was presented to the Government be
par. to.- take shape in my r-ind.
.During, .these travels, I met a young
Spanish- â¢ girl. Her features rather in
clined-to the Jewish type;,her eyes were
laFge and of darkest .hazel : : a profusion
. of black and silken hair hung in a great
' mass below her waist; the delicate lines
of .her body and her exquisite grace and
fascination told of noble-Spanish ances
try "She.was of splendid physique. elas .
Â lic-'step.^nd a superb, dancer. She was
* a t 'home in thÂ« water or'on a hrvr?e and
was an adept with rod, gun. or lariat. .-.
I inquired â¢ into the j history of this
child of nature and found-, that she had
been reared from ,her earliest recollec- 1
tion in the fastness, of -the mountains
remote from civilization. No one knew
the history of her birth. Investigation
only threw a deeper mystery about her
parentage. From a baby she had only
Indian children for playmates, having:
been raised by a ranchero's family who
sold her into bondage to John W.
Snowball and wife. "Those who might
have known her history had died, and
the ranchero. claimed that the child
was an Indian waif whose parentage
was unknown. .
I became Infatuated with her â  ana
also saw. in her a possible heir to the
Peralta grant. I Induced her to accom
pany me and returned to San Fran
cisco. I made a satisfactory showing
of a partial title (which I had forged
with the aid of the Willing title) and
John "W. Mackay stood sponsor for me
to go to Spain for the purpose of com
pleting the title and determining of
what lands the grant actually con
sisted. I had a guarantee of $500 per.

HETTY GREEN'S latest freak is
to have a body guard.
For some time past she has,
been living" in fear of abduction,
murder, robbery, arson and
taxes. And the greatest fear of
all is taxes, for X is to ' avoid paying
theso that she exposes herself to- other
dangers by moving from place to place.
With nearly $60 ,000 .000 to her credit, this
strange woman has never paid a cent of
taxes into tho national treasury. â¢
For many years sho found It an eÃsy
matter to avoid the tax collector by fail
ing to have "a place of habitation." She
kept constantly on the go, and for a
time came near to sleeping in a differ
ent bed every night. She used up nearly
all the towns in tho vicinity of New
York, because there is a paragraph in
the law that says something about "a
second residence." This has mado it nec
essary for her to hustle, and avoid giving
the collector time to locate her.
It is this constant moving about in the
SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE WILSON'S ADVICE TO THE AMERICAN FARMERS.
Â â¢ Â«im.Â« nnri Declares That the Old-Fashioi)ed Farmer Must Go. His Golden Prophecy of the Conning Farmer.
He Says That Agricultural Colleges flre Just as Necessary as Universities, ana ueciarÂ«Â»
Like the Indian, the old-fashioned farmer is doomed. James W. Wilson,
Secretary of Agriculture, says his methods are worn out. They must give way
to the wisdom of science. The farmer youth of to-day is the scientific agricul
turist of to-morrow.
Mr. Wilson told me this when I called on him the other day. He said it
was useless to try to hide the fact that something else was needed to make the
farm pay Besides the apprenticeship of following the plow. People, he said
might call these new fangled ideas if they wanted to, but they were sustained
by facts. The farmer must learn how to make his ground yield the most.
This knowledge he would never gain unless he familiarized himself with the sci
ence of the soil. ' â
Science is doing a good deal in the farmer's interest. Mr. Wilson says. It
has learned a secret that has given a new Impetus to the beet sugar industry.
This is a fact that will make Germany pout and Denmark frown. It is that
by feeding dairy cattle the waste of the sugar beet factories, tho milk they yield
provides nutter and cheese that will hold Its own In any tropical climate. Den
mark's dairy products have almost driven ours out of the Orient and elsewhere,
because they would remain good while ours would spoil. Now it will be dif
ferent.
All this means that we are going to make a great deal more beet sugar. It
means also that the United States Government is quietly adopting a new and
more vigorous policy in agricultural science. It is; the same policy that has
sent a man to South Africa to study tho date palm, preliminary to cultivating
It In Arizona and New Mexico.
Secretary Wilson says there's a new era in store for the farmers of the
United StateÃ, and those of New York and the Mississippi Valley in particu
lar. It will be the new-fashioned farmer who will briny it about. He is the
Moses of modern agriculture.
THE farmer of the future must be
a practical scientist. The man
who does not understand the
science of the 601 l has no business
en the farm. If tho boy wants to
be a farmer. It Is Just as neces
sary that he tako a. course at an agricul
tural college as it la to the boy who wants
to be a lawyer, a doctor, a preacher, to
have a university education.
"The great need of the agricultural col
lego has been instructors who could In
struct. Why, out in lowa we could send
to Chicago and get a carload of chemists,
ir w<_ wanted to pay the money for them,
but v.c could not Una a man who could
teach the student the science of making
butter and cheese. The Government can
er.dow agricultural colleges all it wants
to. The more that Is done the better.
But it cannot furnish instructors, because
there have not been any. We are going
to giv^ a few young men a chance at the
department to learn the scientific features
of instruction In agriculture, but we can
only heip a few.
"Tho only way that these instructors
can be maclo is through the agricultural
colleges. Wo don't want the students
taught the theory, but we want the prac
tical facts put before their eyes. At one
college I know of they are making exten
sive experiments with livestock to show
what pirticular breed it is that will pro
duce the best basis for butter and cheese.
Tho students aro being taught that, not
by hearsay, buj by what they can see.
lit sny that every student puts oh
overalls, takes a milking stool and goes
out and milks, though I myself think
that is a pretty pood way to do. Tho
po-r.t is that <ach boy is taught by the
facts that ;:ro laid before himâ living
factsâ the essen.ee r.f certain truths, and
why they are truths.
"There la no lesson as good as an ob
ject lesson. Tha boy who sees expcrl
l In dairying carried on from clay to
day knows when he .sees the rc-smlts how
it ail came aboutâ and it is not because
some one elso told him that !t was thus
and so. He knows tho science of dairy
ing ond has been taurrht it in the most
practical way. The dairy farmer of the
United States Is goir.g to bo a great fac
tor in the future. He is a factor at pres
ent to be sure, but nothing to what he
will be, and I will tell you whyâ because
â¢we have lcarr.ed the secret of Denmark's
butter and cheese keeping so well in
tropical climates.
â¢"The farmers of New York State and
tr-nao of the Mississippi Valley make a3

change.
But she never refuses to see members
of the press and is always ready to talk
about her lawsuits, several of which sho
always has on hand. That is what she
thought I came for and was all ready
with her long tale of oppression.

of our beet sugar factoriesâ nltrogenous
produds. Now then, all we have to do in
this country to make our butter just as
good in the tropics as that of Denmark
Is to raise the sugar beet and feed the
waste of the factories to the dairy cows.
There Is no healthier fodder than thl?.
and it will make the sugar beet a mighty
valuable product in a groat many ways.
Congress has made an appropriation to
help along the cultivation of the sugar
beet. In this way not only is our sugar
production given a great Impetus, but w
are strengthening our dairy products in
the only way In which they were weak.
Now we will not have to tako Becond
place anywhere.
"This shows how necessary it is thai
the farmer should understand the ocienci '
of agriculture. It shows what sr-ionti'ii <
Investigation brings about. If I had not <
wanted to find out why Denmark's butt-- (l
would keep whore ours wouldn't, if I hail i
net sent a man to Denmark to learn thÂ«
scientific reasons, we would not have beei.^
in the position we are to-dayâ able to <
enter into competition with Denmark <
without feeling that nhe has any advan- ,
tage over us In her butter and cheese. It <
Is in everything the farmer has to cul- (
tivate and grow that the reason for his '
being an agricultural scientist Is found <
If he knows the reason why things don't -
grow or do grow, or his crops are largo-,
or small, he gains a wisdom that will,
help him the next year to increase his "
crops and so make his Income greater.
The scientific farmer has a better chance
of making a big Income than any farmer'
ever had. But the man who insists on
following tho old-fashioned methods of,
never learning anything that his father
did not know Is going to have trouble to
make both ends meet.
"There is no placa that the farmer
needs to apply scientific methods raorr
than out where they irrigate th^ir land.
I am going to have that matter thorough
ly looked Into. Hundreds of acres of fine
lafld are being ruinod because the in' n
who irrigate them do not understand the
scientific facts about It. They let ton
much water run on the land; this brings,
the alkali to the surface and tho result
Is that there is no use trying to grow
anything. Now what should bo done is
to study the science of the soil so as to
know how to apply tho water and in what
quantity. If scientific reasoning had been
employed in tho beginning, this Land
would not have been comparatively
worthless to-day.
"The new-fashioned farmer, the scien
tific farmer, must study the feeding of
cattle. Not a pound of cotton r,?ed was
fed to the four hundred thousand cattle
we exported last year, although tho South
raised 000,000 tons of It. That cotton seed
was mostly wasted, or made fertilizer of.
Think what it mi.qht have amounted to if
It had been fed to beef cattle. The
trouble with the farmer is that he don't
know how to make tho best of what he
lms got. and he has got to learn the sci
ence of agriculture to know how.

Mrs. Green told me that she dresses
shabbily for a purpose. She declared
positively that she believes there is a
conspiracy among the lawyers of New
York to take her life.
"They are my arch enemies," she said,
"and not one of them would heÃitate to
kill me if he thought he could do so with
out being found out. 1 make them toe
the chalk'.ine, and that's the reason they
don't like me."
Mrs. Green has a desk at the Chemical
Bank in New York, and has to be there
every day to look alter her vast inter
ests. The traveling back and forth be
tween the back and her home is what
caueed her to get a bodyguard.
"My bodyguard is a nephew of a form

wart young fellow at that. Of course,
I wouldn't have his name published, be
cause that would establish his identity,
and some day when it chanced that he

As she prows older Hetty Green does
not improve in manners. She is careless
!n her speech, drops her final g's and
uses slang freely. Money making and
talking are her chief pleasures, and her
main object in life is to leave to her son,
Edward, who lives in a princely stylo on
his ranch in Texas, a great fortune. She
has proved that, in finance, woman can
be the equal of man. Her energy and
endurance at CO years of age surprise all
who have dealings vrlth her. She is a
woman such as only American soil could
produce.
The accompanying photograph was
taken by flashlight in the back parlor of
the Hohoken boarding house. It is an ex
act likeness and gives a better idea of the
character of the woman than any picture
made heretofore. With all her fear of
assassination, she had no hesitation about
Bitting in front of the camera, even
though the photographer was a stranger
to her. But that is Mrs. Green's dispo
sition; when she trusts people, she does
so implicitly.
Mrs. Green is now in a most happy
frame of mind on account of a big strike
said to have Just been made In one of her
mines in California. "It may amount to
a. million dollars," she said. "And if It
doesn't reach that sum, why, well and
gorxi. Whatever it does realize is that
much gain. A dollar is a dollar."
In the number ot years she has been
around the money markets of America
Hetty Green has changed very little. She

did five years ago. when she attracted
the attention of the financial world by
the boldness of her investmemts and her

a bite at mv leg. But he didn't follow me
in on the instant. The darkness scared
him a little, and that gave us the chance
to get a few feet in the lead and grab
the picks and shovels.
"We wore about forty feet back to the
turn, and as the tunnel is largo there was
considerable light.
" 'Crack tho first one that comes along,"
gasped Henry. 'If you show fear we are
gone. They'Jl be here in a second If they
are coming at all.'
"And in a second' we were right in the
track of a fight. The big fellow that wa3
right behind me only waited for the rest
of the pack to catch up and then dashed
right after us. Our running away seemed
to give the beasts courage.
"The big follow seemed to have singled
me out, for he Jumped Btralght for my
throat. I was ready for him and floored
him with the pick between the eyes. He
went down like a log.
"Then I warmed up to the fight and
went for the wolves without giving them
a chance to come at me. Henry did the
same and we laid about us on all sides,
and wherever we saw a wolf one of us
hit it. But we didn't get in another blow
like my firnt one. Every wolf had to be
struck several tlmep. I hit one fellow on
tho head and rolled him over, but In a
couple of seconds he was on top of my
back with his teeth in my shoulder.
Henry caught him one over the loins with
hiH shovel ,and laid him out. but my left
arm was useless for fighting after that
and things began to look mighty serious.
"Part of the time the wolves would
crowd us, and part of tho time we would
crowd the wolves. Our arms . and legs
were bitten and our faces and hands
scarred, but fortunately we managed to
beat the beasts off.
"After we had killed three wolves and
had all the others pretty badly battered
up a big fellow got up behind me and
knocked me down. For a moment I
thought all was up and expected to feel
the sharp teeth In my neck. But Henry
was on hand. With a swinging blow
from his shovel he caught the wolf under
the Jaw and put it out of the fight.
Another blow on the back of the head
stretched him out good.
"Then I got up and went at it again.
I was badly used up, but so were the re
maining wolves. In a few moments there
was only one wolf left. He lost courage
and started to get out, but Henry cor
nered him and spilt his head with his
shovel. Then we sat down to rest and
cool off.
"We killed eight wolves, and all of them
big fellows. We were badly used up, but
with no serious wounds. We managed
to get back to our cabin, where we found
neighbors. They went up and skinned our
game after seeing us safely in bed. Tho
eight skins are beauties and I guess we
can sell them for enough to pay U3 for
the time we have to spend in bed. I am

close manner of living.
Old Wall street men tell innumerable
stories about the woman's closeness and
about her wonderful success on the
street. She was In Philadelphia one day
when the market suddenly changed, and
she found that unless she reached New
York before the close of the Stock Ex
change she would miss a chance to make
several thousand dollars. No train would
bring her here in time, and she opened
negotiations for a special engine. A price
was named for an engine and one car,
and, after Haggling some few minutes,
Mrs. Green made this final proposition:
"Take off the *:<.r and make it $5 less.
I'll ride in the locomotive cab." She had
a dusty but a speedy ride to this city,
and she reached Wall street in time to
make a successful turn.
At another time she had a large amount
of Reading securities which she had
ordered aei brokers to transfer to Phila
delphia for her. When she Learned that
they would have to pay the express com
pany a rate in proportion to the value of
the securities j-hÂ« was horrified.
"What, pay $100 for taking that bundle
to Philadelphia! I can gq there and back
myself for $4 and save ?Sfi." Sho gath
ered up the securities In her black bag
and carried thorn over to Philadelphia
herself.
Once when John J. Cisco was her bank
er she came into the establishment with
seyeral hundred thousand dollars' worth
of securities In the black bag. She said
she had walked all the way down town
and was tired. The banker expostulated
with her for her recklessness in taking
such a risk of attack and robbery on the
street.
"Why didn't you come down in a car
riage?" he demanded.
"You may be able to ride In cabs, Cis
co," said the richest woman in America,
sharply, "but I can't afford it."
Mrs. Green used to keep all her plate
and diamonds, as well as her securities.
In the strong hoxes of the Clscos, and
once a month she would go down, there
and polish up the articles and cut her
awn coupons. She keeps up the practice
to-day at the Chemical Bank.
One clay a report floated around Wall
street that Cisco was in trouble. The re
port was not verified, but it reached Mrs.
Greens ears, and she went at once to
the bank and demanded every cent of
her account. She had $750,000 on deposit
there. Cisco protested that the with
drawal of such a large single amount In
one day would ruin him, but this mado
no difference to Mrs. Grrcn. She de
manded her money and got it. It re
quired two cabs to carry away all her
strong boxes. The bank failed the next
day.
A few years ago it was discovered in
Chicago that forged deeds to property
owned by Mrs. Hetty Green to the
amount of (1,000,000 were in circulation.
When the attempt of the schemers to
raise money on the forged deeds brought
the plot to light Mrs. Green's attorney.
Mr. Bisbee, set to work to protect her
interests and bag the crooks. A trap was
set for the forgers, and the assistance of

I asked Mr. Wilson if he believed the
statement that we could starve Europe
out if we wanted to; that we really had
control of the food markets of the world.
"There is no doubt about the truth of
the last half of your question." he said.
"As things stand to-day we have what
the speculator calls the bulge on the rest
of the world in breadstuffs. We could
certainly supply the markets of the world

mate some transfer or deal on the for
geries to obtain the forged document it
pelf. Secrecy was the only hope of gain-
Ing proof of guilt, as the law does not
touch the holders, but only the makers
of forged deeds.
Attorney Bisbee was to delay filing a
bill in chancery to quiet the titles to the
property until the thieves were caught.
But the minute Mrs. Green, who was at
Far ftockaway, heard of the arrange
ment she hurried to Chicago and hired
another lawyer to file the necessary bill.
SI i- had a storm\- interview with Mr.
Bisbee, in which she declared that she
hn'\ not the slightest interest in bringing
the forgers to justice, and that he should
have known better than to take any
chances.
"You look after my interests. P.isbe.e,"
she said sharply, "and keep tne titles to
my property clear. That's what I pay
you for. I^et the police catch their own
thieves."
The son, Edward H. R. Green., has de
veloped into a gooii business man, and
while not what might be called extrava
gantly liberal, is not especially noted for
closeness. He has an r>rt' n - ; --i! Ipst. His
knee was injured while coasting when he
was 7 years old and it was never prop
erly attended to. Years afterward, when
It was too late, Mrs. Green secured treat
ment for the lad from a prominent sur
geon of Philadelphia, but he could not
save the limb, nnri after young Green
had attained his majority the amputation
was performed. The operation took place
in a boarding house ;it No. 2f> West
Eighteenth street. The Greens have not
stopped at that house for some years
now.
Once, when Ned was a tall, lanky
youth, he lived with his mother some
where in the neighborhood of Fourth
avenue and Thirteenth street. He spent
most of his leisure time around the Fire
Department house on Thirteenth street,
and Captain Breslin and porno of his men
remember him very well. At that time
his mother allowed him 50 cents a day
for his meals, and he used to eat in a
cheap restaurant on Fourth avenue, just
below Union Square. Up to the time he
was 20 years old Ned Green was accus
tomed to take the newspaper which his
mother bad purchased early in the morn
ing and sell it on the street corner
after she had finished studying the finan
cial page.
The general public learned with aston
ishment that Hetty Green had a husband
and a daughter. Mr. Green has dropped
so completely out of sight during the
last decade that even the financial world
and the brokers who used to know him
In Wall street had forgotten him. He is
a very tall man. very quiet and polite
and a confirmed "club bachelor."
He was a member of the Union Club
for years. He sleep? in a room on West
Nineteenth street and eats and reads and
look? out of the window at the Union
Club. One of his days is very much like
another. He sees his wife occasionally.
It 19 years since they have lived togeth

in the valleys of the Nile and would give
the Russian farmer a chance that â¢ has

they could all do these things In a mo

get along without us that is what they
would do.
"Europe never will get along without
up, however. She will never want to. She
thinks too much of us. And there are no
set (if circumstances that could entirely
stop the shipping of meat and breadstuff s
to Europe. There can be no laws passed
in this country that will do it, and if any
country tries to have an international law
so construed a3 to shut us out anywhere
we will have the law changed. You can
not keep the American farmer down."

lows him a sort of pension from her enor
mous fortune. It suffices ior his modest
wants.
Yet. in his time, this tall, quiet
old man was known as "Spendthrift
Green." He was a high roller before the
war and the gayest of a very gay set.
He came from Bellows Falls, Vt.. and
made a fortune at Manila, the capital of
the Philippine Islands. He lived on the
islands pever.tce-n years, and he had a
million when he met and married Harriet
Robinson. Tlv'ir married life was happy
enough, but after he lost his money spec
ulating in Wall street Mrs. Qreen did not
feel that she could accord him that re
spect and honor due from wife to hus
band. He was too poor r; man of busi
ness, she said; so they agreed to live un
der different roofs.
Miss Sylvia Green, who Is about 30
years old, has led a rather uneventful
life. For several years she has traveled
around with her mother from boarding
bouse to boarding-house, but she tired
of this two years ago. and it was decided
to launch her into society. Miss Annie
Leary, who had always taken a deep In
terest in Sylvia, agreed to Introduce her,
and Sylvia went to some parties and to
Newport for two or three seasons. She
doesn't like society, and she has so de
clared herself several times. She would
like a home of her own with her mother,
but Mrs. Green knows that a permanent
residence means regular visits from the
tax collector, and so she clings to her
boarding-house life. Br&
These are the four people most directly
interested in a fortune of $60.000.000â .the

no taxes, develops no new industries,

own increment. It is as useful to human

A bookseller's opinion of a book may
be as instructive afl a critic's, thoupb the
point of view is different; and a letter
which Literature has received from a
correspondent throws a certain amount
of light upon this branch of the subject:
"For reasons which concern no one but
myself," writes the correspondent, "I re
cently decided to get rid of a certain
number of modern books, and a book
seller duly arrived to look at them and
make an offer.
" 'What I particularly want,' he said,
as he turned them over, 'is rrd books.'
" 'What port Of books?' I asked.
" 'Red booksâ that is to say, books In
red covers,' was his reply.
"And he proceeded to explain: 'Of
course, there are a few people who know
about books, and insist on having tha
book they wart without reference to the
color of the binding; but the great mass
of our customers .nidge by appearances.
Drab books and gray books and brown
books they won't have anything to do
with; green books will pass: blue books
sell a shade better; but red books always
find a market. You can have no idea,
unless you're in the trade, what a differ
ence it makes to a book to be bound In
red.' "

"There never was a time," said Mr. "Wil
son slowly, "when the boy who wanted to
be a farmer, and was willing to go about
It the right way, had a better chance
than he has tn-day, nor as good. He has
got scientific facts to aid him now where
before he had nothing but example.
"So far as making the boy stay on the
farm is concerned, I think it Is a great
mistake to try ' to influence him. Ha

inclined and let him go to the city if ha

"Where do you think the best opportu
nity lies for the young man who wishes
to be a farmer?" I asked. The answer
came with the speed of a Mauser bullet:

I HAVE had my wish. Tan mil

am rich: I am rich! Good-by to
nare and work.
Po epoke Elsie Tyson in the kitch
en of a Humboldt County farm a
few days apo.
In the livinpr room of the farmhouse pat
Thomas Wilson, a lawyer from Sydney,
Australia, who a few moments before had
told Elsie that she was her uncle's heir
ess and could draw on his lawyers for
any amount till the estate is finally set
tled.
When he. first told us Elsie was dum
founded, and I thought the young Eng
lishman -was Joking. But he wasn't. He
had traveled almost around the world
searching for Elsie, and once having
found her lost no time In telling her of
her good fortune.
"You see," he told me afterward. "1
had no doubt of the. ynunp woman's Iden
tity, for Elsie- Tyson resembles her uncle
so strongly that I could have picked her
out of a crowd."
Then I went into the kitchen, where
Elsie was. She had slipped from her
chair onto the floor and snt all doubled
up with her h^ad in her hand.
"Do you know, I almost fainted when
Mr. Wilson told m* of my good fortune."
phe said, ss I laid my hand on her tum
bied hair. "We all thought that T'nrle
Jamrs was dead years ago. We had
heard that he was wealthyâ but $10,000,
--000! I had no idea that it was so much.
And now it Is all mine. Do you hear me,
Carrie? I am rich. I can buy the world.
Everj body will be happy. Oh, I am going
to do lots of Rood.
"No more suffering from poverty, be
ca'.iso 1 know what poverty is. It crushed
out my father's heart and took my moth
er's life. My brothers and sisters died
because of poverty. No, no, no. there will
more poverty, because I have $10,
--â¢ and will stop all the heartaches in
the world."
And then Elsie Tyson forgot, tempor
arily, all that had made her life worth
the living. She had had her trials and
cares but she had also had her joys. Her
simple rural pleasures she now put be
hind her. Her chickens and ducks and
turkeys, the little Jersey calf, her pig
eons, her birds, her flowers and even the
neighbors she loved, all seemed to go out
of her mind. She must begin using that
$10,000,000.
I tried to get her to tell me the details
of how she came by her good fortune,
but she couldn't do it. Her mind was
on other things. I told her it was time
to teed the turkeys, but she told me to
do it. "You may have them all, Car
rie." she said. "I have $10,000,000 to spend
and have no time to look after poultry."
Attorney Wilson came prepared to take
away his heiress In proper style. "Here's
a little to start with," he said as he emp
tied a leather money belt on the rough
kitchen table.
Gold, silver and bank notes lay in a
glittering heap. It dazzled Elsie, even
though it -was all hers, and it dazzled all
thÂ« rest of us. "Ten thousand dollars,"
said Mr. Wilson, counting over the treas
ure. "I guess that will last until you get
to San Francisco, where we can get con
nection with the Bank of England, so I
can identify you and arrange it so you
can write checks for almost any amount
you wish. You are indeed a fortunate
girl."
The next morning an aunt of Mr. "Wil
son's arrived at the Humboldt County
farmhouse, and that afternoon the three
left for Pan Francisco. It was arranged
that "Elsie should stay at the home of
Mr. Wil=nns relatives until the final
proofs were made and she would be sole
mistress over one of the largest estates
!n Australia. In the meantime she could
Bpend the (10,900 as she saw fit.
"And your credit will be good for many
times that amount." said Mr. Wilson,
"as soon as you are known at the
banks."
All day long on that last day at the
farm Elsie danced through the house. "I
am rich! I am rich:" she kept saying.
<a no never wont near the old treasures of
her â art. They were as if they never
had been. "Let me get away quick. I
must see the world; I must know joy;
I must know greatness. I am so happy.
And to think that T am to make every
body else happy. Oh. this is joy. This i 3
happiness. This Is life."
Bofor^ leaving the old HumboMt Coun
ty farm Elsie gave liberally to everybody.
The friends who had given her a home
after her mother's death were well pro
vided for. Bui Elsie went away without
a regret. As she climbed onto the. stage
Phe waved her hand as gayly as if she
â¢wore only going to a picnic. Instead of
leaving her best friends forever.
"She's as heartless as a stone," I
thought as I saw the stags roll over the
distant hill, and went into the farmyard
to look after the flocks that a few days
before had been such a pleasure to her.
A few days later I saw Elsie in San
Francisco, domiciled in an elegant home,
Burrounded by every luxury, with every
want supplied.
'â¢Oh, T am so unhappy," were her first
words a = she came forward to greet me.
'N"f>w that I ran have everything T want,
I don't know what I want. Everything
is arranged, and I am going to start for
Bydney, Australia, by way of Scotland,
next week. You know, all my people
â¢were Scotch."
"But you will enjoy the trip." I paid.
'"No. no." Phe answered, "I will not.
How Is my dear old white hen? Did she
hatch any chickens? You know they
Should have come out last Thursday.
And the big gobbler? I>o my ducks quack
as loudly aa they used to? Sometime* I
used to think they made too mu"h noise,
law I would give worlds to hear
them. The <lp;!r things, they used to give
mÂ» so much pleasure."
"But you have money now, Elsie."
Bald, "and can have all thÂ« ducks and
chickens and things that you want."
The heiress to $10,000,000 grave me a look
I shal! never forget.
"Money!" she said scornfully. "Money
will not buy true friends; it will not huy
a home; it will not buy my dear old
white hen; it will nnt buy living beings
that love you. I would just like to hold
the old white her in my hand .and prrr-s
rt down against my cheek. No,
money will not buy that feeling.
"Aii this money has only brought me
loneliness. If father and mother and
â¢rs and sisters were only alive. It
would be different. I could use it to
make them happy. But I can only spend
it on myself, and when T fee! that I â â mi

have been a few weeks ago.
â¢'Then I went over to the big: hotel
across the way. T had, when I once saw
it long r:g n . thought that I would like
to live there. But the charm had Bed.
They showed me through the gilded
room? fgmlshed In silk and velvet. They
showed me works of art and bric-a-brac.
But it was cold, cheerless, empty and
lonesome xnd made me long for my cozy
room In the Humboldt County forest.
There was love and affection up there.
"I have been everywhere; to the opera,
the theaters, concerts and have seen all
the Interesting points of San Francisco.
I have bought a wardrobe of fine clothes,
but they don't give me the pleasure that
my 'best dress" used to, even though It
cost only a few dollars.
"Wherever I turn is poverty that I can

the other day. expecting that he would
at once rush home and bring joy to his

"Just how all this money can bring me

wish, except that I am unhappy. Per

"And then to think of how T come hy

"They say ho lonkod like father, and I

just as T am now."
Thon Elsie Tyson burst into trars and
I kn<-w that her heart was not as hard
us it had seemed to mo on that day when
she drove away from the Humboldt
County farm. U-aving poverty and hap
piness behind her and going out into the
world to take her place in the ranks of
wealth.
Thon Elsie told mo the story of h<--r
father's family and the chain of strange
Incidents that led up to hor fortune. It
is a long story and goes back m the bo
ginning of the century. At that time
thoro lived in a little town in Scotland,
on the ostato of tho Puke of Argylc, a
farmer namod Thomas Tyson. There was
a groat graystone old-fashioned house
with parlors furnished with -precise
squarely sot furniture, always darkened
and lockod except on very state occa
sions. Little less than a wedding or fun
eral ever saw tho front of the house in
use. All tho lifo centered around the
grent brick-flOored kitchen, whero the
big joints turned on the spits before the
kitohon fro.
Then there were already five little sons
playing about the farmyard among the
calvea and poultry. The eldest, a boy
of only 11 years, knew that he would
have to make his own way in the world
and leave the old place to take care of
the others. His father, a hard-hearted
Scotchman, said "Very well," but the
mother's heart ached as. she put into the
new tin trunk the clothing she had made
for her son. his only earnest of the for
tune he was to find In far-off Australia.
So the boy left home. It was months
before they heard from him, but at last
a letter, like the first chapter from ' Rob
inson Crusoe," came to the quiet old
"home, farm." Many letters passed be
tween the mother and her boy. When
the mother had been dead 40 years and
her boy was an old man of 70 these old
letters were found in the iron box where
James Tyson kept his deeds and the re
ceipts of'alt his great wealth. When he
was dead these letters were used to
trace his birth back to Scotland. The
old church register told Mr. Wilson, the
attorney, that three of tho sons and four
daughters born after James went to Aus
tralia lay buried with their parents out
side in the churchyard. The name of
one son only. Thomns. appeared beside
James on the !>irth record and not among
the deaths.
Where was Thomas? He had married
"FMz-i Coates,. spin.=ter." 4S years brfore
and sailed for America. Twenty years
later, at hi* father's denrh. he had re
turned and settled up his father's estate
and gone back to America.
Attorney Wilson followed the trail of
Thomas to America and to the only ad
dress he hadâ that given In a letter from
a little hoy. ".Jimmle," who wrote to hl3
uncle In Australia 32 yrars ago.
It took the lawyer to Orange, N. Y.
There he found the record of little Jlm
mie's death as "eldest son" of Thomas
and Eliza Tyson.
"Of course," said Mr. Wilson, "T rea-
Foned if Jinimie were the 'eldest son'
there must be younger ones. T could find
r.o trace of the family and every one
had forgotten them. Almost despairing
of the lost heirs. I started into the ceme
tery where Jimmie was burled. I was
surprised to se<Â» that the little grave was
in mv."h better condition than any of the
other gra\ es. There was some attempt
at flowers and the little marble cross had
evidently been placed on the grayÂ« much
â  Inter than the grave Itself had been
made. It gave me an idea. I hunted up
the old verger, or caretaker, as you call
him. He was as decrepit as the graves
he kept. But lie had a bright little
grandchild. While I was asking about
the grave she exclaimed:
"â <>h, grandpa. T know. That In the
grave the lady used to write about, and
she sent some money. No. don't you re
member? I had some of the money be
cause I kept the weeds pulled up. Oh, I
remember.'
" 'Can't you find me one of those old
letters?' I asked.
"The little girl ran up stairs and pretty
soon cam" down all dusty, with her
checks red with excitement. She had a
bundle of letters, and I found jnveral
written by Eliza Coates and giving ncr
address.
"I went to Illinois. The house was gone
whose number Mrs. Tyson had given. I
went to the records again and the ceme

as Tyson. But I found a woman who
had known the family, and she told me
about them. After hor husband's death
Mr?. Kliza Tysnn sold what property they
had, and with Elsie, the only child left of
her family of seven children, she came
out to California."
"Yes," interjected Miss Tyson, telling
her part of the story. "Mother's health
was very poor. I think it was trouble
which broke her down. When Jimmie
died she could not bear to stay in
(â¢r;u:ge, so father sold the place and we
went to Illinois. Then the first winter
my sister Nellie was born, and Tommie
and Mollie died. Then Jack died:
he was 8 years old and the only boy, and
father never got over the shock of hi a
death. Little Jack fell off the barn,
where he was helping father shingle, and
father blamed himself for lotting him go
up with him. Then Nellie died.. I was
tho oldest in the family, and I have
closed the eyes of every one of my broth
ers and sisters, except only Jimmie, and
his death, and being carried to his bod in
the night to say good>by to him. while
my father held me in his arms and some
one else stood near holding two candles,
is the first of my life that I remember.
It has all been like that night.
"Mother and I came to Southern Cali
fornia. Wo had only about $7'Yi and no
way of earning much more. We rented
a little placeand I raised chickens. Mother
had everything she needed, but she was
always worrying about me. I did not
â¢ I only wanted her to live. She
died, though, and then I could not bear
to stay in th" house alono. I felt all the
time as if she must come back, and every
time a door opened I looked up, expecting
to sop her.
"Then some neighbors were going t/>
move up here. They came up to take up
a homestead and raise sheep. They a.-ked
me to come with them, and I did. Every
thing I had in the world till last week
was my stock of turkeys and chickens
and ducks. It seems strange. Just as I
had got used to the life, and I love the
mountains; they are good company when
all your folks are dead."
Miss Tyson is quite at home In her lux
urious surroundings, for Attorney Wilson
has placed her where she can want for
nothing more. No one would imagine
that tho quiet little woman, going and
coming in her shopping, had Just fallen
heir to so much property. She is getting
some "clothes as are clothes." She Is a
country bred woman with simple man
ners, which belong with a genuine
straightforward character.
â¢'I keep finding myself economizing; it
is second nature." she said. "But money
is nice. It is nice to think It is there.
I really rather like It all. But It Isn't
what you would think it would be. I am
not different a bit. You might think it
would be like an earthquake, with me, and
that I WOUld feel different. I don't. I
only feel that I am alone, and keep think

father and all the rest were, only here.
"I was <*o interested tn every r.hicken

"She Is not unlike old Tyson," Mr. Wil
son said. "She has very much the same
dispositionâ Scotch and square-cut, which
nothing can make any different. His
history is almost a history of the pas
toral industry of Australia. He went to
the 'bush' so young that he became a
perfect example of the bushmen who
have made Australia what It Is. They
are moztiy all dead. He was queer, ac
cording *o our notions, but he considered
us and our ways much more 'queer. He
began fi'-st as Rheep herder on a big sta

few hundred pounds and went down to
Sydney to buy cattle to stock a range.
"In those days any one could take land,
for they were all 'squatters.' But Tyson
did not get his cattle. The man who
was his partner went further than Syd

got to Sydney he found he had no money
bo he -went back. He followed the Murray
River, walking and living on fish and
game. When he Btruck across country
he was lost and nearly starved to death.
Then when he arrived at his employer's

"Tyson was a leader In the 'round-up,'
which is called the blackest spot in the
history of Australia. To his dying day
Tyson believed heartily that those dozen
squatters did a service for which they
should have been publicly honored by
their countrymen. Tn ridinj? over his
raiiÃe the son of a cattleman was killed
by natives. Hla murder was but one of
dozens, unprovoked and without cause.
The squatters decided to take matters
into their own hands. They formed a
cordon and drove all the black fellows,
men, women and children, into a pad
dock, just as they rounded up cattle,.
Then they phot every living; one of them.
It ended the troubles with the natives
for a time even more effectually than the
poisoning had done a few years before.
Mr. Tyson'P first year? In Australia were
filled with reverses which would have
overcome ;t weaker man. but he held on.
His dream in early years was to own a
cattle station of his own. Once he had
enough money saved from five years of
hard labor to set up for himself on the
Blllytong River. He had purchased part
of his bullocks, when the bank where his
money was deposited failed. He lost ev
ery penny and had to go back to work.
Three times misfortune took every -cent
from him. Then came the discovery of
gold in the Bendigo mines. Tyson started
at once for 'the diggings, but not with a
shovel. He bought all the bullocks he
could and drove them toward the mines.
There he sold them at an Immense profit,
and then bought more and sold them. He
bought cattle wherever he could and
drove them to the mines, and that was
the beginning of his fortune. Then he
bought land and droves of sheep and cat
tle, and everything he touched prospered.
He had no idea of his wealth. When he
pnld his beeves he sent the money to his
agents in Sydney and they bought la.ml
and built blocks for him. He would go to
Sydney only when he was obliged to
do so.
"I tried to get him to do the town once,"
Mr. Wilson said, "but he would not. To
ward night he got on his Horse as usual
and rode outside the town. He foiind
an open place and under a tree lay down
on the ground with his saddle for a pil
low. On questions of religion his creed
was as pimple as the rest of his life, and
he cared nothing of what people said of
him. It ain't my business,' he used to
say. 'I do what I think in seriously right.
I stand to tnke my chance, and I am not
afraid.' I once asked him if he were
happy in his lonely life, for he lived
alone in his cabin, owning the land for
scores of miles in every direction. His
repiv W&8: 'You see. the fun is In the little
gamp. Every man who chooses has vis
little game, with a fair chance of winning
if he keeps straight. Tt ir, better worth
his while to do what he thinks is seri
ously right. If ho does not he is bound
to lose. Yes, T have had my little game
and enjoyed it, and I am as happy as
most people.'
"Mr. Tyson never married, and never
Haw but one woman he wanted to marry.
He had not the nerve to even suggest it
to her. He saw her only twice, and yet
all bis life he kept her image with himâ

Mr. Wilson, who knew the old man.
James Tyson, as well as any one could
know him. says his niece is not unlike
him in appearance and character. Going
to Australia so young. Mr. Tyson grew up
to be a typical Australian of the class
that is almost extinct. Simple, frugal,
honest, he had no use for the money he
amassed. Tie was a man more than six
fpet in height, he had never been sick in
his life, and was wont to boast that he
had never slept In a city, never worn a
white shirt, never washed with soap-he
used sandâ never been inside a church, a
theater, a school or a public house. He
considered a church just as bad as a pub
lic house, if not worse. A clergyman was
to him an unfathomable mystery. As New
South "Wales increased in population a
church was nepded on one corner of Mr.
Tysons land where a village had grown,
up. After a great deal of discussion, it
was decided to fisW Mr. Tyson to help the
church, though he had never been known
to give away money.
"Yes, I'll help you," he replieJ. "Send
me the bill for the whole thing. I'll pay
it, but don't come to me again." He wrote
out a check forthwith not only fir the
cost of the church and furnishing but also
for a year's salary for the rector. The
next year the trustees of the church asked
Mr. Tyson's assistance again. The old
man was very angry. "I gave the Al
mighty a house. ' If he can't take care of
it he is not worth helping." he said, and
not another cent would he give.
"Mr. Tyson had no idea of the value or
the .power of his wealth. He cared not
a bit what was done with the money
which his fortune earned.
" 'You know about handling the stuff,'
he would say to his lawyers 'just you
buy whatever wnl pay best.'
"lie never questioned the investment. He
wore to the end shabby, ready-made
clothesâ the cheapest in the market. His
cabin he cared for himself, and never,
unless under the most urgent circum
stances, would he sleep away from home.
"We often tried to get him to make his
will, but he would put us off with a
chuckling laugh.
" 'You lawyers know everything. You'll
miss mr> and want sompthing to do when
I'm dead. You can find some one who
wll! take the money and things off your
hands.'
"It was only after his deÃth that we
found that he had come from Argyle.
He never spoke about his antecedents."
"Now he is dead and gone, and the only
living relative he has In the world will
go out to inherit his millions.
"I do not know what I'm going to do
yet," she said. "I shall Rive everything
they can use to the friends who have been
kind to me.
"Mr. Wilson says that will scarcely be
one day's Income. T suppose T shall get
used to having so much money. Some
times I like to think how rich I am or
shall be. but I never" felt so lonely in my
life. I am going to travel, and I shall

In the meantime Mr. Webber had con
ducted me into his orange experimental
station, located In one of the greenhouses
of the department. It was carefully lock

was about 70 degrees. The benches were
filled with plants, averaging about three
feet in height. There were find speci

and the hybrid, the latter showing the
effects of the crossing or hybridization in
a combination of the characteristics of
the parent plants.

In undertaking to hybridize orange
plants due rerartl 1= given to the fact that
in many -â¢-â -- and pis
tils, when in the same flower, mature at
different times. In manipulating orange
flowers mature buds, nearly ready to
open, ire selected. The tips are carefully
pried apart until the stamen's are exposed.
In these flowers the anthers are attached
to the filaments by very slender threads,
which are easily brcken. so that the sim
plest method cf removing the stamens is
to pull them off with fine pointed forceps.
To croEE fertilize the orange it is neces

the -â¢!rrr.a and cut the stamens out.
Then transfer the pollen from the other

of the common orange predominate In
others the ruggedness of the trifoliate is
more marked. The majority of the hy
brids, however, show such gratifying re
sults as to justify the Secretary of
Agriculture to stimulating and encour
aging the pending experiments to the full
extent of the resources of the department.
The results looked for cannot be accom
plished without the exper. re of consid
erable time, patience and money. It may
be ten, fifteen or twenty years before the

occur in this particular department of the
vegetable kingdom. -'.-%*>
Among the possibilities is a successful
cross of the juicy.. and seedless ravel or
ange with the loose-skinned tangerine. A
nation of these two choice varieties
of the golden fruit will tend to Increase
the consumption of oranges in the upper
as well as the lower classes of society.
At present oranges on a dinner table or
at a. reception are used largely for decora
tive purposes. It is too much trouble for
the ordinary guest at social functions to
bother with an orange. Besides, the in
conveniences attending 'he removal of
the skin are greater than the pleas! - of
eating the fruit, so that a hostess is apt
to have but few requests for oranges from
her guests. A combination of the lus
clouyhess of the navel variety and the
easily removed skin of the tangerine
would undoubtedly increase the popular
ity, of the orange at swell social functions.
Within a few weeks Mr. "Webber will
proceed southward with some of the well
developed hybrids and plant them at va
rious points In Florida and Georgia to test
their hardiness. The plants to be thus
tested are about two years old, and they
are expected to begin bearing fruit within
the next two or three years. Their de
velopment will be eagerly noted by all the
orange-growers of the country who are in
sympathy with the movement to produce
an orange tree that will withstand the
treacherous touch of frost.

; Ciil rcany other notable things and was
â  a typical ATnerican speculator, organizer
-
A native of Scarboro, Me., and grandson
of a Scotchman who came to America, in
ITST>. Kali-y received a common school ed
ucation and as a poor boy became a
baker's apprentice. When he had learned
his trade, at the age of 21, he went tc
New York City and there found work.
H:s employer trusted him and sent him
rotmd to collect bills, and then ser.t him
into the country to collect, payics him
not a salary, but a percentage. In the
second yfar Haley had enough money to
start a bskery of his own.
_After Haley had been a baker in New
lork for seven years, with no thought
...... but a baker, an unex
pected incident turned his er.ereies in an
other direction and led him to" become a
builder and manager of an electric tele
graph. The line from Washington â¢ i Bal
timore, thirty miles long, constructed by
a Congressional appropriation for the pur
pose of testing the practical value of a
r\ B. Morse's invention, succeeded In the
transmission of messages, but failed In
the payment of expenses.
"With this idea in the autumn of 1544
Morse went to New York to orz-anis" a
company that should build the proposed
extension. He was accompanied by two of
his partnersâ Amos Kendall of Ken
tucky, who had been Postmaster General
and F. O. J. Smith of Maine, an ex-mem
ber of Congress and a distinguished man
in hjs own State. These three notables
were received with much courtesy by the
leading capitalists and merchants of thÂ»
metropolis, but there their success ended.
After the partners had spent several
weeks to; the city and had appealed in
vain to all the leading business men. men
whom they supposed were leaders, they
agreed that It was useless to continue
solicitations there or to undertake otfao-s
elsewhere. The time, they saw. had not
come for the organization of a telegraph
company. Kendall announced his Inten
tion of going back to Ktntuckv and Smith
prepared to return to Main*. The latte
v.ent to say good-by to his cousin Mrs
John J. Haley, and whiie making hi* fare
well call told her of his pian and diÂ«^p
pointment. Mr. Haley happened to be
present, listened with muca interest and
then asked questions to learn precisely
what the electric telegraph was and how
Morse and his part:.- - had tried to get
subscriptions, to whom they had applied
and what were the reasons for the refus
als. Having satisfied his curiosity, he
said: "Mr. Smith, I can get that sub
scription " for you to-morrow morning "
Through a certain political knowledge
Haley succeeded. Haley also closed sev
eral gaps in the telegraph circuit and also
worked through a line to New Orleans.
A.'-: completing the line to New Or
leans Haley returned to New York, where
he was managing director of the Morse
lines until ISO*.
! Having no desire to return to the baking
! business in New York, and seeing no en
i ticing opportunity there to invest Ida
j mon*y, he determined to try his luck in
! California, He sold out his stocks in the
' Brooklyn ferry and his real estateâln
i eluding forty acres in Brock'.vr.. said to
j be now worth 110.000,00*â bought machln-
Uery and supplies for a quartz mill and
early in 1*62 started for California, bring
ing with him $90,000 in cash. He found a
'quartz mine near Jamestown, In Tuolumne
1 County, bought it and started to erect a
i roiJ!. and got rid of nearly all his money
â¢ before the mill was finished, and then he
j was satisfied that his mine was worthies*.
i He knew nothing of mining or mill man
' agement, and the venture did no credit to
bis judgment.
It was necessary for him to make a
new start, and he decided to return to bis
trade. He hunted a place for a shop In
San Francisco and found it on Commercial
street, then the chief thoroughfare of the
city, because it had the "long wharf."
where most of the bay and river steamers
'â¢ and sloops had their landing places. East
of Battery on the north side of Commer
cial was a restaurant In a or.e-story
wooden building, shabby Inside and out.
The proprietor, discouraged and jrlad to
find a purchaser, sold nut house, fixtures.
. stock on hand and the lot, 55 feet front
I and 60 deep, for $10,000, and Haley took
* immediate possession, tore down the
; house, built a new one with brick, with
an excellent oven, and soon opened a res
taurant that was the most stylish in the
city. The oven was large ana was man
aged by Swain, who excelled In bread
cakes and pies, and afterward made a for
tune in a similar establishment of his
; own.
( Haley opened his Boulevard Restaurant
â¢on the Ist of February. 1&3. and soon
found that he had struck a good lead.
"Within a week receipts ran up to $400
r a. day. and not long afterward he cleared

Having been dm en back to san *****
Cisco, he opened a broker's office dealt .n
real estate and freer backs and *&*Â£Â£
la led in land. He planned the South sa.
Francisco Homestead Association, studied
out plans for giving more convergent ac
ceÂ« to the land south of Islais Cove, per
suaded Henry F. Williams to become the i
head of the new organization, and so.d
his Wi acres at Hunters Point to it for
H59.000 under the condition that he shcUd
contribute one-hair of this sura to aid the ,
construction cf a wagon road and horse
railroad, -with bridges across Mission ani
Islais coves, thus giving direct roads from
the business strict of the city to tÂ«e
eastern parts of the Potrero and of t-e
point beyond It. The bridges had an ag
gregate 'length of a. mile and a Quarter,
and' a= the new road was hard ana j
smooth it became a favorite drive It ad- .
vertised the southern portion cÂ» the city j
and diverted capital and speculation in ,
that direction. _ â¢ ., \

which in ISO he divided up into lots, call
ed the Haley Tract, and soid it for Cw.
-o*o. leaving more than SrÂ».&Â» above all
costs and expenses. Mr. O'Xell. wno nad
tome adjacent land, put it into Haley Â«
har-ds and he sold it as the Haley & ,

purchase, comprising forty acres beiong

About his profit on the one before it I j
have no information. Â« ]
This restless man was persuaded In
1889 that he could greatly enlarge his for
tune by buying and managing a silver ,
mine in Eastern Nevada and fee jumped
Into the new business with characteristic '
energy- The result was the same as In j
his previous mining ventures; he speedily
lost nearly ail that he had saved in year 3 j
of labor. Again he returned to San Fran
cisco and reopened his office as a broker, â 
dealing mainly in real estate, in which he
continued until he employed in 1*.2 :
by the Central Pacific Railroad Company.
to which he had rendered very important
services eight years previously.
The Legislature of Calif -.'ma in 1553
adopted a bill providing that if the people
of fe^n Francisco consented at a special j
election the city should subscribe VJfiJiA
to thÂ«- stock cf " the Central Pacific and '
HB6JOM to that of the Western Paci-c. the ;
latter to connect San Francisco with Sac- !
ramer.to Ly way of San Jc-se. Niles and !
Stockton. When the time came for tr.e
popular vote on the question of the sub- .
sidy the business men. dry cff.ciais and
cewspapers -were bitterly Hostile to tbe
project. The laborers generally were wili- â 
ing to vote money for anything that
would give employment to many men. |
zrA, therefore, were in favor of the sub- i
Fidy. but th*-ir feelings had not been ad
vised by speeches or journalistic advo
cacy of* the railroad scheme, and there
fore many cf them did not feel like going
to the polls. The man who had been in
trusted with th* mans cement of the cam
paign for tbe Central Pacific did not un- :
derstand such business, and by injudicious
tactics did mere harm than g r Â»od to the
tau?e. At neon it wa= known that a large
majority of all the ballots cast and nearly
ail the workers at the jk>lls were against
the railroad. The politicians said the sub-'
scription was certainly defeated. .
Mr. Haley, who was not then in the ser
vice of the Central Pacific, heard about
I o'clock of the situation and started out
to retrieve the day. He went to George
H. Hossefross. foreman cf Monumental
Engine Company, an experienced election
worker, to ieam what he thought of the ;
chances. The reply was that the railroad :
was teater. so far, but that with good
mar.sgemer.t and much labor the result]
might be. changed. Fifty go-od men. whom j
be ; could select, would bring thousands to j
the polls, but these men must be pai-d.
Halev had $13W In his safe and asked .
whether it would be enough. Hossefross
thought it -would, and sent out to summon '
his helpers, while Haley hurried to his
office for the cash. The money was spent,
tbe day was won, and a subsidy of *IJXÂ«&.
--(â¢Â» was saved from defeat. Haley's in- i
vestment was returned to him and the â¢
great value of his service was acknowl- '
edged.
Though the people had given a majority
for the subscription, the Supervisors, sup
ported by the newspapers and business
men generally, refused to appropriate
money for the stock, but after much con
troversy offered to compromise and pay
rrW.COii 'outright, without taking stock.
thus avoiding possible responsibility
for debts that might be incurred by
the companies. This proposition was ac
cepted and an order was made for the
payment. But the Auditor. John C. May
nard. refused to draw his warrant, for the
reason that the Legislature had author
ized the city to buy stock, and not give
away money. His course greatly embar
rassed the Central Pacific directors, who.
counting confidently on getting this con
tribution without delay, had made con
tracts to the amount of hundreds cf thou
sands of dollars,, and were then beset by
creditors clamoring for payment and
threatening lawsuits that would brine dis
crrdit on their enterprise, if not force
them into bankruptcy. They applied to
leadine capitalists of San Francisco. Tev
is. Ralston. Reese and others, for loans,
and failne to get them offered to sell a
majority of the shares in the stock of the
Central Pacific, with the control of the
company, for JI.<VÂ».OC*X They were dis
mayed by the rejection of their proposal;
they could see nothing but trouble before
them. Haley heard of the situation and
made an effort to relieve them. Knowing
Maynard well, he went to him and plead
ed the cause of the railroad, spoke of the
popular demand for an iron track across
the continent, of the act of the Legisla
ture .-nd vote of the people promising
heip. of thÂ» debts incurred on reliance In
the good faith of San Francisco, of the
consent of the companies to reduce the
amount of the contribution, of the obliga
tion of the city to keep its contract and of
the Inability of the Auditor to know how
the Supreme Court would decide if this
matter were submitted to Its judgment.
Whether Maynard was convinced by
Haley's argument or by his own reflec
tions" provoked In the course of this con
versation is unknown, but at Its close he
â¢ said â¢ hat he had changed his mind, and
Haley sent word to Stanford, then in Sac
ramento, to come to San Francisco and
get his wariinl Mr. Stanford did not
let the grass grow under his feet after
receiving that amu until he had the
important paper in his pocket. One of
the San Francisco capitalists, having per
haps heard of Mr. Maynard's change of
position, called en Mr. Stanford while In
the city and said he and some asoeiates
had decided to take the majority of the
Central Pacific at the price mentioned.
Stanford replied: "It's too late: we're out
of the woods." The other. whr> h.ivi made
few mistakes in bargains, said that his
refusal to accept Stanford's otter when
first made was "the mistake of his life."
En MSI, when the Central Pacific Com
pany moved its main offices to San Fran
cisco. Mr. Haley was emnlnyfel as a
broker to buy the lots aeeoed for ter
minal crounds. station &nÂ»i offices, and
when hi? purchases had atnountrd to
$2,000,000 he presented his bill for $3dAV\ a
commission of 1 per cent, charge that
was pa:d without objection. Then it tras
thought cheaper to take him into the
service of the company as agent to pur
chase rights of way and manage buslr.eÂ«Â«
before the Supervisors.
While in their service he planned the
cable road on California street fVon
Kcamy to Central avenue, and submitted
his scheme to Stanford, who said it wmm
not a matter for the company, hut he
would take hold of It as a pcWorM In
vestment if Haley would pet subscribers
for one-third of the stock and obtain "
franchise. Having complied with tnoÂ«2
conditions Hale? hunted for an encjneer
and found Henry Root, who proved to Â£Â£
an excellent man for thÂ« place T'n.Vr
Stanford's direction he built * road much
superior to that on Clay street a Tn<? Â£Â«
proved the grip, which, "as nowus^l "l

steel and concrete Instead of Wood and

notable event in the development ofsVn

"Western Addition " which then sHd.ienlv

-
THE LATE JOHN J. HALEY.
When the directors of the Central PÂ»
--! dfic obtained control of the Western Pi.
ciSc road the terminus in this city was it
the lunction cf Market and Valencia
streets, and connection -with the business
â¢ eerier was made by a steara dummy
' n&micg on Market, from First to Valen
cia street, -with a branch on Hayes street
:to Lacuna. Thi3 dummy road as
â¢ rouphlv built, poorly stocked, had a short
lived franchise, and -was unpopular, be
: cause there were lone- Intervals between
â¢ tralxiS, and many complaints -were made
;' of the use of steam locoraotives on ilar-
I ket street. Stanford was disturbed by the
1 complaints; be saw no prospect cf prour
' in the line after the San Jose station had
moved to Third and Towaseod streets.
' and he considered a street car line be
: neath the dignity cf the Central Pacif c,
i For these reasons he instructed Haley to
; find out the money value of the Market
1 street line and then to hunt m> a jrur
[ chaser.
In accordance with his instructions Ha
. ley studied the value of the property. He
' found out how many people r.ad their
: homes in the southern part of the city.
i how many could get homes there, and
i how much they would cost, and pay for
: transportation to the business center. The
: more he examined the more he disliked
; the project of sellinp out. Ke planned a
cable road. with branches on McAllister.
Hayes. Haizht and Valencia streets, and
after estimating outeo and income de
! cid?d it "was worthy of respectful eonsid
â¢ erati~n by millionaires. He induced them
â  to delay "the proposed sale, but for sev-
I era! years couid net persuade them to re
â¢ build* At last he convinced JHuntinjrtcr.
wh r> r^uested him to attend a. meetirz
at the Central PaciSc Board with his
I plans and estimates. Haley was there
with his paper?, and with his help Hunt
i Ineton induced his associates to consent
1 to" build the Market-street system of ca
ble roads if Haley could get a franenhise
fc- fifty y fc ar=. The reads were built soon
â¢ afterward J and they hare more than ful
: tiled all Mr. Haley's predictions of profit.
After the Haisht-streei branch ' had
â¢ t*en completed to Stanyan street, Mr.
: Half y planned an extension with a rteam
i dummy â the power fcÂ£3 since been
I f-han^d to electricityâ to the ocean
i beach; and a^ain he had to advocate his
i scheme for a Ion? time Before he eouid
' convert his employers. Finally â he built
I the read and he had the satisfaction or

P^.^, -is:? till ISSS Mr. Haley was the
r-anaeer for the Southern and Central
p^ari"^ and thrir associated street com
gSe^ c? all their complicated business
relations with the dtyVofflcials. He had
so much inf.uer.ee with the tuperriscrs
that he was called the thirteenth mepber
of the board, and had the credit cf bein 5
the moFt inSuential among - them. Ha
made himself familiar with their charac
ter* habits, prejudices, weainesise* and.
srnbltions. and foimd how he could please
i them without exposing: his employers cr
himself to formidable public censure- Â± na
newspapers sometimes hinted that he paid
money, but he said that was unnecessary
' and t^des was extremely darg-erous. I o
I the men who helped him he frare cigars.
i wines, lunches and sometimes railroad
', tickets; but usually he relied for succe?s
,on arruments. He said he never askei
' an ofSci&l to do any act that he believed
! contrarj* to the public interest.
On c Tie occasiori a majority cf the Su
; pervisors had declared themselves favor
! able to an ordinance for raising- the rrad-s
!of Market street, between Mason aci
i Stockton, the incres.se of elevation at
I Pcwell street to be a foot and a half.
j This chance would have subjected the

; his principals and they said they did not
I want to appear in the matter. It would

did net want n> antagonize the majority
of the Supervisors, The opposir.c prop

so he studied the Question. He found that
some of the Supervisors favored the i>rc

Then he investigated the motives of this
; man and learned thst if th* irrade were
; raised he w-ould be able to collect a debt
! of $3000 which otherwise misrht never be
I paid. Haley went to this man, spoke of
I the litigation that would certainly follow
I the adoption of the ordinance, of* the de
j lay and uncertainty *in the decision, and
! of the possibility that the property hold

Some years after the larce building used

i and had received a oonvoy*nco i:nÂ«ler or
; der of a Probate Court ruVportinc to con
vey all his interest. The money had be.'n
expended for. his benefit, but the lawyer
who examined the papers for the com
pany had overlooked a serious flaw.
Judire Sanderson and Hall McAllister
ajcreed that the vowr* man's title was
jrood in law, and McAllister sai.l that,
counting the back rents, it would be bet
ter that the company shor.W pay $4A).<V>9
than contest the case to final issue in the
courts. The plaintiff lived in Virginia, and
his attorney in New York City. *o some
one had to take a trip across th<? conti

that as this was a matter cf \e srai techni
cality it should have bc-en intrusted to â¢
lawyer. but Haley -was selected,
i . . .ONE organ grinder in England
seems about to come Into an earl
dom and one of the proudest es
tates in the British isles.
His name is Viscount Hinton and
he stands a good chance, accord
ing to eminent attorneys, of proving that
he Is the oldest son of the late Earl of
Pculett. In fact, according to the rec
ords, there Is no doubt of this, and the
only difficulty will ba a matter of legal
technicality.
Taken altogether, the story 1b one of
the strangest and most romantlo that has
ever been told even in England, that
country of claimants of titles.
There are several stories in circulation
as to how the late Earl of Poulett came
to marry the mother of Viscount Hinton,
the claimant of the earldom. These
agree rema'kably well in most particu
lars, but th<i one that Js mostly told and
is generally accepted as reliable is as
follows:
In IM9 George Poulett (the late Earl)
was a merry young officer stationed at
Portsea with the Twenty-second Regi
ment of British Infantry.
One night the officers of the Junior mesa
were drinking merrily and got to Joking
about marriage, which they should have
known is no Joke. Poulett remarked:
"Any kind of a girl will do for me." For
he had never married and had no Idea
that he would ever succeed to a title,
"See here," eald a young nobleman;
"I'll bet you Â£500 you won't go out and
marry the first woman you meet."
"I'll take that," said Poulett. Ho was
in earrf?t, though the other â wan not. He
was heavily In debt, and feared that his
uncle, the rich Earl Poulett, who had
often come to his assistance with the
money lenders, would not again forgive
his extravagance.
When the mess broke up Pouiett
Bought the man whose bet he had taken
fend said he was ready to start,
"I say. Poulett." eaid the other. "Iâ
âI â dang it, you know, I wasn't in earn
est: I don't mind losing the Â£500, but"â
"Are you trying to back out?" sneered
Poulett.
Now, the other man was trying to do
that very thing, and to his last day
vlshed he had done It. But he bit his
lip and said, "I'm ready."
It was early summer. The two young
idiots set out, with a trail of others fol
lowing at a discreet distance, to find Pou
lett's wife. It was very late, or early,
and there were few women in the street.
At last they met one.
"Look here," said Poulett to her;
''what's your name?"
"Lizzie Newman."
Poulett had heard of her. But he said,
sifter a moment's hesitation: "Well, I
Jfc'ant you to marry me, on a bet."
And on June 22, 1849, Poulett was mar
jried to "Miss Elizabeth Lavlna Newman,
daughter of James Newman, a pilot, of
lÂ»ortsea."
THESE MEN HELPED START THE GAME OF BASEBALL IN CALIFORNIA
THE American game of baseball
first saw the light in California
about forty years ago. At that pe
riod the population of the entire
State was less than half a million,
and the leading industries were
gold mining and cattle raising. San Fran
cisco was the center of population and
everything new that came from abroad,
whether it was a new game or a new
dish, was always tried in San Francisco
before it was allowed to reach the inte
rior.
/A few Englishmen from Canada and
Australia Introduced early In the fifties
the old country gamo of cricket, but the
Americans did not take kindly to it. It
was deemed alow in comparison with the
then popular game of rounders, which
had been imported from New England.
Rounders was played with a rubber ball
of great resilience and hard or soft to
suit the taste- of the players, experts pre
ferring a ball almost as hard and as
heavy as lead, for it afforded more fun
when the unlucky runner between bases
had to be "put out," the process of put
ting cut being to hit the runner with the
ball before he could reach the base to
â¢which he was running. Consequently
the heavier and harder tho ball the more
disinclined would be the put-out man to
eit down and rest himself. There being
no "soaking" in cricket, there was.no real
American fun in it, and the game was
played only by quiet, dignified Britishers.
Out of the game of rounders as played
In California and the East was evolved
the game of baseball. The father of the
national gamÂ© in San Francisco was John
Fisher, a well-known mining man, at.
present retired from business and a prom
inent member of the Pioneers. He and
Fire Marshal John L. Durkee had ob
tained an inkling of the new game as
played in New York, and they, with other
ball cranks, prevailed upon some of the
rounder clubs to try their version of the
now game. Durkee and Fisher made the
only style of ball used in California for
the purpose, it being a sphere of rubber
wound around with yarn and covered
with buckskin. The first regulation ball
and the first set of rules- were brought
to San Francisco from Boston in 1859 by
Martin Cosgrlff. who is now In the re
packing- business on Battery street.
There arrived from New York at about
the same time a Mr. Gelson, who had
played the game in New York and was
conceded to. be the only expert in Cali
fornia at that time.
Fisher, Cosgrlflf. Gclson nnd Durkec. to
gether with Dan Drlscoll, of the Blue
Wing saloon on Montgomery street, ar
c&need a match between the Eacles and
According to this story, which may be
called the theory of the defense, Poulett
did not long live with his wife. A son was
born to her on December 15 of the same
year, who is the present claimant.
But there are those who hold that the
tale of the drunken bet Is too incredible,
and hint that Poulett had known the
womanâ everybody knows everybody in a
little townâ and had married her under
compulsion and lived with her come five
years.
Still another tale Is that Betty Newman
was a good and pure girl whom Poulett
dearly loved and married, but of whom
in time he tired.
All this matters very little in fact. By
British law, which is American law also,
the boy was born in wedlock and la Pou
lett's legitimate eon. He is now 49 years
old and puts In his claim for his father's
title.
â When Newman, as the- claimant was
called in his younger days, in accordance
with the eettl^ment the Earl made upon
Betty Newman, came of age, he asserted
his claim to the title of Viscount Hinton,
which is derived from Hinton St. George,
an estate of 29.000 acres, which has been
In the family since the fifteenth century.
The Ear', denied the claim, but he asked
the young man to call upon him In this
note, which is in evidence:
Earl Pcraletffl compliments to Lord Hin
ton, end will he be kind enough to call
upon him to-morrow at 11 o'clock at 11
Victoria Mansions, Victoria street?
Lord Hinton promptly obeyed. Arriving
at Victoria Mansions he was shown up
stairs. In the entresol he met his father
for the first time. He was well dressed,
and his address was somewhat haughty
as he broke the Ice by suggesting that
Hinton should go abroad.
Lord Hinton said that he objected to
do bo.
Lord Poulett then suggested that he
ehould drop his title, remarking that titles
were expensive to ke*Â»p up.
Lord Hinton demurred.
""Well, you will think it over," said the
Earl. "You want some money?"
"Yea."
"Very well; go to Mr. Annesley, my so
licitor, and he will relieve you."
The interview lasted twenty minutes,
and was not over-cordial. But Lord Pou
lett had by implication admitted Hinton's
right to the title which he had asked him
to drop for considerations of economy,
and ho had promised him an immediate
supply of cash.
The reason for this first and only inter
view was this: The Viscount had become
a professional clown and acrobat and had
the Red Rovers, in the year 1559. and the
bases were marked out in old Butcher
town on the Potrero. It was an experi
ment for the boys, and they mixed up
rounders and baseball in tho most ludi
crous way. In running between bases
they expected to be hit with the ball as
iin rounders before being put out. When
a man dropped the bat and started for
the first base h<? m^<le a home run, and
it was difficult to convince him that he
had been put out before he reached the
first base pimply because he missed the
old feeling of pnin under the coat tails,
which in rounders was the infallible
symptom of failure.
For many years the ball was pitched

made one Lydla Sheppy, a ballet dancer,
VlFcountess Hinton. and the Earl did not
wish them to remain In England.
Hinton's career on the stage was un
lucky. On the fifth night of his engage
ment at the Garrick Theater. White
chapel, he fell down a trap. For three
months he was kept alive by being fed
by a spoon, and a bad scar remains on
his face to show whero he was hurt.
It was about this time that Hinton's
first baby came. Tho Dowager Duchess
of Cleveland. Mrs. Poulett. a distant rela
tive, and other ladles were kind to the
young parents, and tided them over tho
bad times.
In 1572 Viscount and Lady Hinton or
ganized a stage troupe of their own. which
failed disastrously. It was alter this, and
aftrr some adventures abroad which have
been briefly referred to. that Hinton set
up a barrel organ. And this ho has con
tinued to play, because it was proiltable
and because It annoyed the old Earl.
It did annoy him! To the day of his
death Poulett came to I^ondon as seldom
as possible, for he knew that when he
came the organ would promptly appear
under his window, with the placard: "I
am Viscount Hinton, etc." conspicuously
displayed thereon and play sweet har
monies.
It's a very good organ, too. The late
E'.iETf-ne Field, who interviewed Hinton
some years ago, wrote that It had five
cylinders, played fifty tunes, and "must
have cost a small fortune."
The Viscount is a slightly built man,
with rather good features marred by dis
sipation. The. Viscountess, who generally
accompanies him, is a faded, bloated,
commonplace woman, blondined and
flashy of a distinctly Inferior type.
The Hintons have made a good living
with their organ. They are popular with
the London public because they are gen
erous to those less prosperous than them
selves, because they are always willing to
"appear for charity." and because the
people, with Innate British love of fair
play, believe that Earl Poulett should
underhand instead of overhand, as at
present. There were no such things as
curves or erratic twists, speed being the
only quality nought after by the pitcher
and the philosophy of curves being an
unknown quantity. Owing to this fact,
the scores of runs were large; without
this explanation it might be thought that
the boys of forty years ago were very
poor players when the runs on each side
were in many noted games allowed to
mount into the eighties and nineties. Be
cause of the mode of pitching tha batter
was enabled to knock the ball all over
the field, and the fielders were kept on
the move at all stages of the play. None
of the players was allowed to wear

have provided for his .son. The Viscount
has been befriended by many In the aris
tocracy, also, and h!s son and daughter
have been fairly educated.
The tenants on the Hinton St. George
estate, on the other hand, favor the son
of the third marriage, for obvious rea
sons.
That Betty Newman's son will be the
Earl Foulett ami her grandson Viscount
Ilinton in turn there can be little doubt.
It will be a bitter pill for the House of
Lords; but law is law, and the British
courts will uphold it. IÂ»d< ed, had not the
late Karl known that liinton would al
most certainly inherit he would not hava
been In such haste to ruin himself.
Years ago, when Hinton was in trouble
at the Old Bailey, tho main charge
against him was that he had obtained
money on his claim to the Poulett estates,
knowing the claim to bo invalid.
The papers in defense were handed to
the late Sir William Charley, the Com
mon Sergeant, who was sitting as Judge.
After looking them over. Sir William said
that instead of proving that the claim was
bad the deeds secnu/i rather to afford
evidence of its validity. He was not a
conveyancing lawyer, but he had seen
enough to show him that even if the
claimant did not prove his claim, upon the
documents in evidence he had ample ma
terial for believing that his claim was
Â£C(.d.
In other words, no fraud had been com
mitted.
Bo the organ-grinder may put on the
ermine and get what good he can out of
the 29.000 acres of Hinton St. George,
mortgaged to its full earning capacity.
His claim will be fought at every step,
but It Ib difficult to see how it can be de
feated in the end.
So far as a spat in the House of Lords
is concerned, Hinton'p succpps is not so
easily predicahle, aÂ« the House Is. itself
the Judge of the qualifications of its own
members. Still, in the end the noble
gloves or masks as at the present day,
and there was no wall or backstop be
hind the catcher, no that if he let a ball
get past him with men on the bases it
was "all day" with him. The pitcher w.=
not the king-pin of the lot as now. and
all the players had frequent opportuni
ties to distinguish themselves, no matter
In what part of the field they might be
stationed.
The trial game between the Red Rov
ers and the Eagles was so satisfactory
that a baseball club, the first on the Pa
cific coast, was organized shortly after

Club, and its first president was Expert
Gelson. They practiced for a while un-
Lords will doubtless reason that it is
useless to provide the younger disputant
with the Beat without the estate to sup
port it.
And what an estate it is! One of the
finest in England; twelve miles long: with
a model village upon it; with a special
telephone service between its parts; in
cluding portions of eighteen parishes;
with its splendid avenue of cedars; with
one of the stateliest homes in England;
with its great library and its art treas
ures by Van Dyck, Murillo, Corregio, Ru
bens. Rembrandt and others, and its rent
roll of Â£10,310â trusted for the mortgagors.
Yes, it is a fine estate, and there is an
other fine one â Granvllle Hall in Hamp
shire.
There is talk of a compromise, but Hin
ton's solicitor, G. H. Hall, intimates that
he has too good a case.
The circumstances which brought about
the possibility of Viscount Hinton being
a claimant for the earldom of PoulPtt
are Indeed strange. When the late earl
married Billy Newman there were five
lives between him and the sixth earl's
title. He had no expectation of even get
ting It.
But onÂ© after another the fifth Earl's
three son* died, then an elder cousin, then
the heartbroken Earl himself, and Cap
tain Poulett succeeded to the title. He was
not then living with his wife. She died
in 1830, first telling her son that he was
Viscount Hinton. The young man had
been educated at Poulett's expense until
he was IS year? old, at Portsmouth.
The poor woman, who had. by all ac
counts, been a true wife to Poulett. was
not even allowed to dip in peace.
When Viscount Hinton, then just of
age, was summoned to her bedside to re
ceive her last blessing she said to him:
"I am not in pain, but"â then her voice
sank to a nervous whisperâ "there is an
eye that sometimes stares through a

matches between these two attracted
considerable attention from players in

existence and baseball clubs were formed

"It must he a delusion, mother," said
I^rd Hinton. "No one would come and
glower at a dying woman through a crack

"Its true," paid the dying woman. "I've

when I let on tfj be asleep."
Lord Hinton went out to ask the land
lady.
"Yes," she said, after some hesitation,
"it is trup. Emma Johnston comes down
from Rose-bank. Waterloo, to find out how
soon ma is gome to die, and she haa
prepou thrnnph the donr."
What a picture] Emma Johnston was
the lady who. six weeks after the first
Lady Poulett died, became the second
Countess. She died without issue in 1576.
In 1579 Poulett married Rosa, de' Melville,
daughter of Alfred Hugh de Melville, and
her son was recognized by Poulett as hia
heir.

Viscount Hinton, the claimant to the
cnrldnm. has something of a reputation
in America, and from all accounts It la
nothing to be proud of. Just when he came
to this country seems to be a matter of
doubt. But while here he played many
pnrts. He is a man who has been by
turns a tramp, a circus clown and a
mountebank; who has been arrested in
Louisville, Ky., for fraud on the Latonia
race track and driven from Chicago by
the bare recognition of hts fact.
Later, after he got out of this country,
he served Bix months in a military prison
for desertion from his regiment in India
after having swindled Calcutta mer
chants; he was locked up in Port Said for
attempting the life of a croupier in a
gambling house. He then escaped to Eng
land and was soon sent to prison for nine
months for defrauding Jewelers, gun
smiths and others; and has for years

"Mm*?, la Marquise will not withdraw her favors from the painters of her

They had resumed their inspection of the album when the door was
thrown open and a tail man, with small, keen, piercing eyes and malicious

The newcomer remained motionless upon the threshold and gazed
around him. while one of the party stammered forth to the assemblage:

wardrobe; but th.> event* of the day had stirred up a crowd of rÂ«nenÂ»
brances In the heart of the good hostess, remembrances which lingerie
long after the departure of this guest. A vague and Inexplicable aisrun
etude had seized her. and. although the name of this man. Vallet, await
ened no particular train of thought, she could not throw from her tnÂ«
presentiment that rome unknown peril threatened. â 
Vallet was an important agent charged with the duty of attending to
the pleasures of Louis XV and the Marquise de Pompadour. It was he,
the sinister and mysterious man, who supplied the sad and famous
Parc-aux-Cerfs with guests fcr the King.
He had on this same day noticed the charms of Gillette.
Already the beauty of the favorite, Mme. de Pompadour, was waning,
as was also her health.
She was a prey to terrible spells of weariness, of weakness; her eyes
were sunken, wrinkles had made their appearance, and the stamp of grow
ing age had set its seal upon her face. She lived in a state of constant
disquietude, fearing to lose the favor of the King, and suspecting hersell
surrounded by plotters and schemers for her downfall. The institution <>l
the Parc-aux-Cerfs was her latest invention. To replace the youth thr.l
had fled from her. she surrounded the King with a bevy of young women
brought to Versailles by Vallet.
Vallet concealed the character of his infamous calling and presented
himself under the title of commissioner of the chatelet. He, in a word
bought, on account of the King, the house, with its appendages, out
buildings and offices, in the Rue. Saint-Mederic at Versailles.
It was in the first days of the year 1757, in the middle of a severe win
ter. A heavy fall of snow covered the houses, the bridges, the quays and
the barges upon the frozen river. The pedestrians did not linger in the
streets, but hastened on through the biting cold, their cloaks drawn up to
their noses, and shivering in every limb. Night had just closed In; Some
women were leaving Saint-Ge.rmain-l'Auxorrois. Sounds of music floated
lightly through the frosty air. Walking with effort, and leaning upon thÂ«
arm of Gillette, was Mme. Poincelet among the last stragglers in the Rue
B< thlsy.
A carriage without driver, the horses attached to which blocked the
street, compelled the two women to separate and to make their way in
single file along the narrow footpath close to the houses. .
Mme. Poincelet went ahead, and. having reached the corner of the Rue
I'Arbre, turned to retake Gillette's arm.
During the brief time occupied thus the porte cochere of the Malson de
Vallet had been thrown open and Gillette found herself suddenly between a
man of low Stature, who seemed to be looking on the ground for some
thing, and an individual who held the door half open. She stepped aside
to avoid the person who was stooping, and. as she did so. she felt herself
dragged by her cloak. Tn another moment she was within the entrance
and the heavy door had closed upon her, all being .accomplished before
she could suspect a snare or utter a cry. Hurried away, in spite of her
tears and supplications, she was soon conducted by the two men to the
extreme end of the hotel and led into a room, the windows of which werb
securely fastened and hung with draperies bo thick as to prevent the
cries of the prisoner being heard. . â¢
The astonishment that seized Mme. Poincelet on finding herself alone
could not be adequately described. She remained for an instant as though
suddenly seized with vertigo. She was alone In the deserted streets, calling
in vain upon Gillette. She retraced her steps 's quickly as was possible,
for the carriage still obstructed the path. Gazing at the gloomy looking
house, she hurried on to the entrance of the church, cherishing a vague
hope that the young gfrl had re-entered the edifice. The sexton had closed
the doors, and. with the slow and laggard steps peculiar to attendants
in churches, went about extinguishing the lights, one by one. in the chan
cel. The agitated steps of the poor woman echoed in the vault of the de
serted chapel; no other sound broke the stillness, and hurrying on through
the edifice she made her way out by a little side door and was once more
alone in the darkness and cold of the street. Overcome by her emotion,
she burst into tears. Filled with fear and dread; she hastened on through,
the Icy cold and over the frozen pavement, calling In a voice that awak
ened no echo, the name. "Gillette! Gillette!"
Arriving thus before the Cafe Parnasse, she entered quickly and sank,
overcome, upon one of the chairs covered with cloaks.
At this hour the uncertain light of two candles placed upon a table
drawn near the stove alone illumined the Cafe Parnasse.

versed with animation with a young man dressed In the garb of a lackey
of a wealthy house. He was a man with a long, yellow face, who looked
profoundly mysterious, while his grim face seemed as if illumined by
some far-off vision seen only by himself. His thoughts seemed to carry
him far away and to render him oblivious to what Andre Chevallier was
saying. A deep>frown contracted his brows.
Andre Chevallier had known Damiens. for such was his name when
he was a servant in the employ of La Bourdonnais. who returned from thÂ«
Indies, miserable, suspected, calumniated, to die in Paris, overwhelmed
with disgust and Injustice.

his companions could not understand. .
"And you will take with you." continued Mme. Poincelet, trie proof

Her tears flowed anew, and at this Poincelet himself became greatly

Day had dawned, and by its gray light pedestrians could be sw
ing alone thp quay and hurrying- on throtigh the yellow fog.
Mme. Poinoelet trembling In every limb, and gliding rather thar-
Ing, made her way along the Rue de la Barillerie and the Court dv Maj,
which inclosed the palace of the old city.
From the mass of black buildings near the Sainte-Chapelle cam<s thÂ«
murmur of indefinable cries and imprecations that sounded not unlike thÂ«
dull noise of a distant torrent.
As she drew near the clash of swords rang out in the fog, an*, the
clamor of human voices became clearer and clearer as Mme. Poincelet
advanced toward the Court dcs Comptes.
She now distinguished in the faint light a crowd of men and wnmÂ»i
surrounding the little hotel, brandishing sticks, shaking their fists and
utteririg wild cries.
Several police officers and the French guards, who had dischar^M
their guns upon the crowd, having lost their ground by degr â¢><Â»=, |j |
retreated to the steps of the house of the chief or polio*. Below a furious
group drew after them a dark complexioned man, who was stift<vi aji4
suffocating beneath blows that fell thick and fast from the heavy fists of
the mob.
"Take that, rascal; take that, you miserable scamp. So you will un
dertake the defense of those who starve us, will you?"
A woman struck his breast with a stick.
"Go tell the King that the people will burn Versailles, and all, all wtia
lire at the cost of our misery."
"Hang him!" exclaimed a huge man who had made his way throne'n
the crowd. "Hang him! I recognize the fellow; he wa? one of those â whj
has aided in the abductions of the Faubourg Saint-Antoinp â "
The crowd suspended for a moment its wrath and turned toward the
newcomer. The victim raised his head; large drops of perspiration rolled
down his face from the blows which he had received.
"Hang him!" shrieked the enraged crowd. "Death for the drinker of
blood, death for the- purveyor of the King."
Again blows fell upon the unhappy man. Mme. Poincelet recognize
Vallet and shuddered. The situation was critical for him. Ho was leavirs;
the hotel occupied by Berryer, the chief of police, when the mob that had
formed in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine invaded the Court dv Mai.
When Vallet saw the menacing crowd he retreated in hast* toward the
office of the chief of police, striking right and left with his cane.
The Invaders were in power, and Vallet. as he turned from group to
group, had been recognized by one of the confederates of thp Pont-Nauf.
In an Instant Vallet was the object of plebeian rage. Around him surgM
the excited mass of people, thirsting for blood, mad for revenge. Th*
police and the French guards had profited by the respite afforded by thÂ«
besiegers to peek shelter behind the massive doors, which they closed
firmly, while those less intimidated hastened to the Chatelet for assistance.
Vallet. dragged upon the pavement of the court, covered with blood,
pmaned with pain.
His accomplice of the Pont-Neuf had passed a rope around his neck,
detached in haste from a hay wagon, the end being thrown over a lamp
post.
A great cry arose in the court when the executioners suddenly let go
their hold of Vallet. and his form was seen to swing out into space. Hts
face wore a hideous grimace, and the look of wild supplication Been in his
half-oppn eyes silenced the rude Jests and scoffing of the cruel crowd. Th^
final struggles of the miserable man, as he hung from the iron support,
suddenly snapped the bar, and the lantern with its human freight fpll to
the ground with sudden force. The crowd fell back. only, however, to close
in again, as the waters of a stream disturbed for a moment by the fall of
a heavy body.
Little by little the crowd dispersed through the Court de Jerusalem, the
drums of the Chatelet guard resounded In the Rue de la Barillerie, and
thrse most guilty In the execution of Vallet made haste to effect an es
cape through the inclosure of the Palais.
The soldiers arrived by the Court dv Mai. and a bevy of curious spec
tators hung around the Arch de Nazareth and the Court dcs Compfes.
The irresistible movement of the crowd drew with it Mme. Poincelet,
who. in a few moments, found herself on the Quai dcs Orfevres.
She remained there for some minutes, astonished and surprised by
the display of violence she had witnessed . forgetful for a brief instance of
Gillette, whose abduction she had come to announce to the chief of police.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Pamiens had kept the promise he hart made himselfâ "to warn th^
Klni?."' On the night we saw him quit the Cafe Paraasse he had returned
home, walking: like one in a maze, thinking of the misery of the penp]Â»,
the unhappiness of the Poinceleta. all of which awakened in his mystical
foul the desire to he. the heroic avenger of the corrupt century.
Scarcely knowing the purpose of his journey, he had set out for Ver
sailles at 3* o'clock in the morning in a hired carriage, clasping to his breast
a little prayer hook, a small pair of scissors, a knife and a purse contain
ing twenty-five louts.
Andre Chevallier had reached Versailles the day after Damlens. Carry
ing with him the little silk bag containing the effects found with GillettA.
Andre did not doubt that a recital of the unhappiriess of his parents
by adoption and those of Gillette would touch the King, and he deter
mined to implore the protection of Louis XV, no matter where he should
rneef him.
On arriving at Versailles he had been Informed that the King had left
that samn morning for the Trianon.
A now difficulty presented itself. The approach to the park and th*
chateau was carefully surrounded by Swiss troops, whoso well-drilled
sentinr-ls kept up an uninterrupted guard.
It was only at the close of the day, and after diligent search, that ha
sucr-peded in discovering an approach to the chateau hidden behind tha
wood bordering the extremity of the grand canal.
Tn his hiding place he heard the songs and cries of the Swiss soldier*
within the guardhouse between the deep ditches filled with water.
Near evening, tired and exhausted by his long wait, he, drew near tht>
guardhouse, attracted by an unusual degree of excitement caused by tha
men arraying themselves and hurrying toward the chateau.
Only a ffw guardsmen remained at the guardhouse.
Andre Chevallier thought this the moment to put his plan in execution.
Slowly he followed the course of the canal and reached the cloned gat 6,
framed by two columns surmounted by vases. He climbed upon the pedes
tal nnd reached the marble stops, vacated only a few moments before by
the sentinels. An abnormal and troubled stillness had followed the sounds
of life and animation in the little chateau. Without being seen Andre
Chevallier could climb the nerron which led to the pardons, and he entered
through ;< glass door, which was not closed, but led to a long ronm paved
with black and gray marqueterie. He passed on through two small rooms
on the hearths of which a fire burned, but stopped finally behind a door
.eadlng into a room beyond, whence he could hear Bounds indi
cating that it wns occupied.
"By whom?" Andrr- Ohevallier commenced to douht that the King was
at Trianon. The relaxing of the surveillance. the inexplicable retreat of
the sentinels, suggested the thought that the King had taken his de
parture.
At this thought a feeling of Joy thrilled him, and then he realized In
Its full force the temerity of his project.
ITe decided to seek refuge In flight by the same way he had come, an<J
turned tr.ward the windows of the room he had first entered.
He saw lights moving and could hear the sound of the patrol as the
guard wa!l<e ; to and fro, and he seated himself, motionless, upon one of
the armchairs.
A light coughâ a woman's coughâ broke the stillness. T-ight footsteps
resounded, n door within the adjoining room opened, and Andre heard a
voice call softly, "Jeanne! Jeanne!" then silence succeeded. At length
the door leading Into the little room was opened suddenly and a woman's
head appeared. Tt wns a fair face, with clear blue eyes that scanned anx
louslv the darkness wherein Andre Chevallier was sheltered.
The latter, surprised by the apparition, could not repress a sudden
movement, and the creaking of the chair on which he was seated be
trayed nis presence.
T'tterlng a cry of fear, the young woman closed the door quickly, flrri
nt the sound of a bell rung violently the valets hastened to answer the
summons.
Andre ChevMlier was discovered, and entering the drawing room
stood motionless upon the threshold, his eyes raJsed in mute supplication.
The Marouise de Pompadour, whom he thus surprised, stood behind
a gilt table laden with books, engravings and rolls of music, and her
haughty mien, accentuated by the flight of years, indicated more angt r
than fear.
Without taking a step Andre had fallen upon his knees, and In a voice
choked â with emotion said:

And then? Then the -world -will hear

And then Cora Urquhart Potter will ap

The public airing of the Brown Potter
scandal has never been Mrs. Brown Pot
ter's doing. Other willing hands have
laid bare the blot on the family escutch
eon.
It was the Indignant Potter family that
fanned into flame the sensation Mrs.
Brown Potter created when she recited
" "Ostler Joe." And one Ct them hurled
back at her tho Very words with which
she had thrilled her hearers.
Who lured men's souls to the shores of

"Who sang the song that the siren sang on

power of the press and the power of the

woman.
But it was courage born of desperation
and of genii:?, and therefore it triumphed
â not because of obstacles, but in spite
of them.
Inch by Inch. stop by step, the Potter
family fought her as she slowly but stead
ily mounted the ladder of fame.
And yet. when Bishop Potter lay on his
deathbed she stood poised for the top

Mrs. Potter bore, the odium of this un

swerved from the path of silence which
she marked out for herself.'
Will she break it now? If the question
friends are anxiously asking. If James
Brown Potter forces her to it, yes, is the
answer.
Cora Urquhart Potter's position In her
profession is no longer questioned. Her
success as Miladi â¢in Beerbohm Tree's
production of "The Three Musketeers"
has set all London town a talking of this
spectlng his accomplices.
This circumstance caved Andre Chevallier from torture; he knew that
the slightest sign of recognition between himself and Dnmlens wuuirt be
his ruin. He begged without ceasing that the captain of the guard would
permit him to see the Marquise de Pompadour, asserting that between
them thorp existed a secret. V . â¢; .
Convinced by Andre Chcrvalller's manner, the soldier made Known to
the Marquise the pretensions of the prisoner.
After the first excitement of the scene with Chevaliier had subsided
the Marquise had opened the little silk bag, which her attendant had found
upon the floor with Andre's hat.
She thought herself the plaything of a dream when between her fingers
she held up before her the little dress trimmed with lace that Gillette had
worn at the time she had been abandoned. Also little articles of under
wear in fine linen, bearing the coat-of-arms of Lenormanfl d'Etollles, her
first husbandâ the escutcheon of azure, with the head of a lion In silver
gazing at a gold star placed In the corner. A child's little cap lay before
her, Invoking the purest and holiest remembrances ever known to the
heart of the courtesan. Mrao. de Pompadour's heart throbbed wildly In
her breast, and tears, pure and good, rolled down her cheeks.
The news of the trial of Damiens had called forth considerable emo
tion and excitement pit the Palais and at Trianon. The King had been
taken to Marigny immediately after he had been stabbed by his former
servant, and carried to the apartments of the Queen, and for some days
the- favorite had not Been Louis XV, nor had she received news respecting
his health.
The enforced separation of Mine, de Pompadour and the King was
placed to the profit of. the court. ThÂ« confessors had discreetly caused
Louis XV to realize the scandals called forth by his life with the Marquise.
The courtiers of the Queen's house insisted, above all, that the attempt
at assassination of the King had been committed by a valet employed at
Maiigny, a brother of the Marquise, and drew toward the insignificant
dagger thrust given by Damiens all sorts of deductions Inimical to the
Meanwhile Mme. de Pompadour remained alone In her luxurious bou
doir, a prey to sad reflections, and In silence anticipating the disgrace that
threatened her in the midst of her gorgeous abode.
The life of the deserted boudoir where she no longer awaited the com
ing of the King was full of sadness. . Upon the gilt table, on which lay
costly articles and rare ornaments, had been placed the little garments of
Gillette, and the remembrances of the abandoned child possessed her com-
The visitor whose apparition had so greatly alarmed her she desired to
see once more and to learn from his lips something respecting Gillette,
who was perhaps his betrothed.
From the glimpse she had been afforded of the young man m face he
appeared youthful. Who and what was he, and what tie linked him to
She turned again and again between her fingers the little garments of
her daughter, and tho entire romance of the abandonment of Gillette
haunted her. But any attempt upon her part to Interview the prisoner
would have been folly"
She had sought to learn his name and the motive of h.iÂ» Intrusion. All
the doors of the King's house were closed against her; but Â»he had, at
least, recommended the prisoner to mercy to the captain In charge of him.
Days passed thus, days during which she could neither eat nor sleep.
She was burning with fever and filled with the mad desire to go 'and seek
Andre ChevaHler.
At the many attempts she had made at Versailles to gain Information
respecting the King the strange pallor of her face, her look of weariness
and grief had been noted, and all deemed that upon the face of the Mar
quise was written the signs of her approaching downfall.
One evening near 9 o'clock, regardless of the darkness and cold, she
was carried In her chair across the park to the apartments of Louis XV.
The King was occupied in signing many documents placed upon his desk.
On seeing the Marquise, Louis XV could not restrain an Impulse of
111 humor; but. ever gallant, he requested her to be*seated.
"Mme. la Marquise is abroad late.' he said.
"I could not resist, -sire, the desire to see you." she responded. "I have
lived during the past days in a state of wretched uncertainty respecting
the result of your wounds. Oh, sire, It Is cru^l of you to have abandoned

So Mrs. Brown Potter has wÂ«yn not only
fame a3 a player, but social recognition
abroad.
When she started out on her career she
had as a goal only her artistic success.
But she proudly said she would never 9.0

never lift a finger to gain it. She would
conquer by her art In spite of personal
prejudice. . : *. "
So she ha? denied all Interviewers her
version of the family troubles. Her
friends have not been so reticent. They
object to the Injured-air pose of James
Brown Potter. They throw quite another
light on the affair.
When .Cora l.'rquhart married James
Brown Potter there was a plenteous spill-,
Ing of congratulations. â¢ Both were of
distinguished family and money was not'

As she spoke Mme. de Pompadour burst into tears and threw herself
upon her knees before the King.
"Rise, Marquise; I was forbidden by my physicians to visit you."
Then suddenly changing tho subject he added:
"Rut I have been told that you, Mme. la Marquise, have been visited
during my absence."
"No. sire, the man who intruded upon my privacy was a poor madman
whom the guards thrust from the door. He came, he said, to reclaim his
betrothed."
"And you knew him not?"
"No, sire."
"Th" rascal shall be punished for his audacity."
"Pardon him. sire. Restore to liberty this unfortunate whom grief
has distracted and who caused me only alarm by his entrance."
"Since you desire It, Marquise, ana since the man did not offend you,
we will bid M. de Machault to let him go free; butâ take your leave, Mar
quise; dry your beautiful eye*. I will visit you ere long."
With these word* Louis XV offered his hand to Mmo. de Pompadour.
He accompanied her as far as the antechamber, from which a private
staircase fed to the court. Ar< she passed with her attendants, through
the court of the superintendent she saw three great carriages, drawn by
four horses each, surrounded by a crowd of gendarmes. By the light of
their torches she saw, bound within one of the carriages and wrapped In
white covering, a human form that struggled to escape. Two of the pre
vost's guard and a surgeon of the King entered the carriage with the
prisoner. Into the third carriage officer? forced a man to enter whom the
Marquise recognized aa the individual who had been arrested In her apart
ments at Trianon.
The avenues leading to the chateau were full of cavaliers and sergeants
and French tun rein.
Mme. de Pompadour requested hÂ«r chair to be set down upon the pave
ment of the court, and lnotantly approached the Duke d'Ayen, who com
manded the escort.
"Where are you going to take these people, captain?'
"To the Palais at Paris."
"And you are taking with you the man who intruded upon me at
Trianon?"
"I think that a new order concerning him has come from the King.
In any case, however, he will accompany us to Paris."
"You will surely pet him freÂ«. added the Marquise, amiably. "He
did not harm me. and I have asked for his liberty from the King."
Throughout the long route followed by the carriages detachments of
armed men followed nnd troops of cavaliers were on guard.
In the villages through which they passed the Inhabitants were for
bidden to appear at the windows, and the soldiers of the escort were com
manded to fire 'upon any one who should disobey the order.
In vain had Andre Chpvalller tried to draw from his keepers some ray
of light upon the crime he had been accused of and of the fate that
awaited him. They remained mute.
They drove thus through the sleeping villages of Sevres, Issy. Van
girard. Croix-Bouge, and at length entered the Rue de Four, passed down
the Rue Dauphine. Pont-Neuf and the Qual dcs Orfevres and arrived at
the court of the Palais, which was under military rule.
The three officers led Andre Ohovallier to the chief of police, and after
having passed through the hall they entered the presence of Berryer himself.
He was seated Hb a: small room before a table lighted by candles, and on
which Siere lay numerous papers.
The officer handed Berryer a sealed paper which the Duke d'Ayen had
given him at Versailles, and the former, after having scanned Chevallier
through his spectacles, opened the document and read aloud:
"The chief of police accords* liberty to Andre Chevallier to reside in
Paris, after having admonished him severely for having presented him
self at the Chateau de Trianon."
He turned toward the prisoner.
"So it Is you who did not fear to enter the abode of Mme. la Marquise
de Pompadour. Do you kn<"v that the act you have committed might have
taken you to the galleys? For what end did you elude the vigilance of the

'Mr. I'rqrhart's embarrassed financial
condition is gad to have Irritated the
Potter 'family. High-strung Cora Urqu
fcart Potter resented the Bishop's appar
ently slighting attitude toward her fam- ,
ily. ; There was a breach and James'
Brown Potter for the first time in his life i
dared' to question his father. J
Bishop Potter promptly cut off their al
lowance. Mrs. Brown Potter turned her
thoughts more seriously than ever to
ward her art.
She recited even more frequently than
formerly. One night in a crowded draw-
Ing room she gave " 'Ostler Joe."
People commented on this selection at
the time, but It was not until later that
the incident was made the subject of uni
versal and". warm discussion in the public
prints. James ['.town Potter was In finan
cial straits. His wife's father was no
longer in a position" to help them and she .
would not allow him to seek aid from
nis own father. Why shouldn't she go
on the stage? Her husband did not say .
her. nay, and without announcing their
plans the couple left for London. .Ac
counts or" their doings crossed the waters.
Now !t was that they had been among the
guests at 'a drawing room or house party.
Then it was that she had captured the
friendship and praises of Robert Brown
ing by her vivid readings of his poems.
And one day In glaring headlines the pa
pers announced that Mrs. Brown Potter
was going to male her professional debut
in a London theater as the protege of H.
R. It. and other celebrities.
Bishop Potter sent a cablegram com
manding them to give up the insane idea
and return' immediately for parental re
proof and forgiveness. But when the
home-coming steamer landed Its passen
gers only James Brown Potter of the two
walked down the gangplank. He came
to tell his father, the Bishop, that they
had fully determined on their course. He
remained at homo and became converted
to his father's point of view, and later
he tried his best to aid his father in pre
venting Mrs. Potter's further career on
the stage.
But Cora Urquhart-Potter had gone too
far to -withdraw. She had burned 'her
bridges and was anxious to cross the
Rubicon and she made her debut as an
actress.
London spoke encouragingly of this new
aspirant for fame. American papers
heaped upon her columns of abuse and
riricule. The " 'Oetler Joe" Incident was
raked Into the light and made to run the
entire gamut of sensationalism. 'T^fas
paid that she had ostracized herself so
cially by reciting It. and that there was
nothing but the stage left for her.
Every reason but the one which her
friends claim Is the real one has been
givenâ and that Is. that she went on the
staKft at her husband's suggestion and re
fused to heed him when he vacillated to
his father's standpoint. Cora T'nuhart-
Potter has never told this for publication.
She ma,de but one retort to the criticisms
which have been as hitter as the influ
ence of the Potter family could make
them.
"The latchptrtng of my house Is always
open for my wife." said James Brown
PottT to an Interviewer once.
"I see," continued Berryer; "you are one of a faction who "Pr***

Without listening to the protestations of Andre Chevallier the chief of
police took the address of his prisoner, and. threatening him with all tne
severity of the law, notified him that he was at liberty. .
A thunderbolt could not have struck Chevallier more forcibly, and Bo
remained motionless, believing that he had not heard aright.
"Go." repeated Be.rryer. "and guard well your actions. â¢ :
Like a blind man Andre sought the corridor His escort at a sip rrpm

Balnte-Chappejle, opened a little door and thrust his prisoner forth.
He found himself in the Quai dcs Orfevres and but a few steps from the
Pont-Neuf. which, owing to the excitement and troubles of the night, had
been cleared by the troop* and was now deserted.
Mechanically Andre passed down the Pont-N'euf and observed that
many of the windows in the vicinity of the Palais were un ighted. Those
of the Cafe Parnnsse formed.no exception. Knocking gently, he listened,
and then heard Poincelefs voice Inquire behind the closed blinds the name
of his visitor. He replied. In an instant more uncle and nephew were
clasped in each other's arms. Mrne. Polncelet, In her nightgown hastened
to greet him, and at the summons of Polncelet, Gillette heself joined the
family circle around the stove. -â¢."-.
The "Parnasse" appeared entirely changed, and most of the chairs
were placed against th" four walls.
Slnie. Poincelet was the first to break the silence.
"My poor boy." she said, addressing Andre, "we thought you were
lost when we heard of miens' fate and the arrest of a young man who
answered your description. From MM. Boucher and Rameau. whom we
Implored to Intercede for you with the chief of police and M. Machault, we
obtained only hopeless replied. They would not even inform us of what
crime you were accused."
"By what miracle, my good Andre," asked Poincelet, "have you found
your way here?"
Without replying Andre clasped Gillette to his breast, who artlessly
described her fears while detained for three days In the Malson de Vallet.
On th-Â» third day she found the door open; the old duenna and the porters
in charge had disappeared.
Having effected her escape, she had returned home, troubled at the
thought of meeting father ana mother Polncelet, to whom she owed an ex
planation for her absence.
Polncelet explained that their great desire now was that they all
should leave Paris and seek refuge In Brittany, where Mme. Poincelet had
relatives.
The "Pftrnasse" wns deserted; in fact, the ratrons and friends had not

Ar.dre Chevallier, who shared their fear 3. shook his head.
"Ton will not lf-uve me air ne here, my uncle?" he said
Th^ Poincelets and Gillette replied In one voice, "Ynu are to go
with us."
Andre seized the hand of GiU^tte and that of Mme. Polncelet and
pressed them warmly within hia own.
One bright mornlnp the â "Parnasse" remained closed, and sllenc*
reigned. The pnlire who had hrld guard over Andre Chevallier and tho

Facial to the Sunday Call.
WHEN John Burroughs begun
to write about nature thirty
years ago the remarkable abil
ity he possesses of making the
Ct interesting to the gen
eral reader was recognized at
once. He was accorded the foremost
4>lace among American nature writers al
most from the start, and this he has held
â ever since.
Authors who make the out of door world
their theme have multiplied in recent
â years, but a quarter of a century ago
'Burroughs was nearly alone in his chosen
domain. His work had and contin .
have all the charm of original observa
tion In new fields and the fresh, boyish
enthusiasm of his descriptions Is un
equaled. He has been a pioneer blazing
a path Into the unknown. Many now fol
low in his footsteps, but the position of
patriarch of the clan is his by common
consent, and among his fellow craftsmen
he is regarded with universal affection.
Mr. Burroughs' personal appearance is
strikingly typical of his standing among
authors of his class. He has something
of a pion era simplicity of dress and
manner, and he has the snowy hair and
long white beard of the patriarch. If
you see him about his home you would
take him for a farmerâ not one of the
callous handed, dissipated sort who carry
the odor and L T i'i!'-i<- of their calling about
â¢with them, yet one who is used to real
â work, nevertheless. He has a fondness
for the comfort of old clothes and easy
chocs, and he is no stranger to manual
labor, though most of his farming con
sists in planning and directing.
The farm is his chief support, not hirf
literary work. He does not write fur a
living,' but writes only when he feels
moved to do so and because he loves the
â¢wild things of the woods and fields which
he describes with such truth and insight.
In his earlier life Mr. Burroughs was
for a long time a school teacher, and
later for several y.ars held a Govern
ment position in Washington. But the
'country always called to him. and at
length he bought a little farm on the west,

He has named his place "Riverby. It is

! nearly .the entire crew was put aboard drunk. On a Friday
she sailed and twelve hours later her remains were piled on the
ocean beach. The helpless Bailors were washed overboard, one
after the other and drowned in the breakers.
A month later there was another wreck within a short dis

ashore, as they were afraid of the giant powder. Their fears
proved 10 be well grounded, as the pounding of the vessel on
the rocks exploded the powder, blowing the schooner Into
splinters and wrecking the Cliff House.
Coming down to later times, the British ship Gosford was
run ashore in Cojo Harbor, near Point Conception, on Novein

was" "ecu rid out. from K?n Francisco and on November 18 caught

number of attempts Were m?.de to raise her. but they all failed,
and the bones of the Gosford are still aching In Cojo Harbor.

house is much too civilized to suit our
nature lover's shy woodland genius. He

HAVE YOU THE SENSE OF TASTE ? READ THIS
Special to the Sunday Call.
IT would now seem from experiments
which have been carried on in the
University of lowa that we do not
taste many of the things which we
eat at our daily meals. It is asserted
confidently that we merely smell them.
When we drink coffee or tea, for in
stance, we really do not taste them;
it is the effect which they have on the
olfactory nerve that we experience. If
the nobe is tightly closed in the ordinary
man and he is blindfolded, be will not be
able to distinguish coffee from water or
a weak solution of auinine.
This has been proved by experiments
made on many persons. < 'ommon coffee
was said to be water, it was also said to
be quinine. "Water was" said to be coffee.
Tea was ( ailed coffee. Turkey was called
pork. Raw apple was called grape juice.
Malt extract was sherry wine. I.ard was
pronounced butter. In short, experienced
persons were unable to distinguish many
common foods and drinks when sensa
tions of smell were removed, and the odd
conclusion was reached that a person
might even practice economy in eating by
merely blindfolding the eyes and substi
tuting lard, pork and beef for butter, tur
key and venison, while if the further pre
caution was taken to close the nose, a

Building "Slabsides."
This cabin Is built on a ledge of rock
at the borders of the swamp. It is a
fair sized story and a half structure with
one room below stairs and a loft above.
Along one side is a broad piazza with
shaggy cedar' posts. The outer walls are
of slabs, and this hns led its owner to
call it "Blabsldes," a name not altogether
liked by the author's friends. They find
the title too rude, but Mr. Burroughs says
"It's a rough and ready place and why
shouldn't It have a rough and ready
name? I can't stand anything that has
very weak solution of quinine would pass
for good coffee and vinegar for the most
costly wine.
The experiments which led to these con
clusions were carried on by Professor H.
T. W. Patrick of the University of lowa,
who has just communicated some of the
results of his work to the American Psy
chological Society. Professor Patrick was
enabled to attain great accuracy -in his
work by the fact that one of the persons
"he experini.rn.il upon was an anosmic â
that is, absolutely devoid of the sense of
smell. He was enabled thus to determine
which sensations were those of taste and
which were smell. He experimented also
on normal subjects and borne of the re
sults were surprising.
There are only four simple taste sensa
tions, namely, sweet, bitter, sour and salt.
It is said by some that there are only two,
sweet and bitter. All other sensations
which are commonly called tastes are
complex results of sensations of smell,
touch, temperature and sight. The means
by which we distinguish almost all of our
common foods and drinks is not the sense
of taste so much as it is the sense of
smell, touch, temperature and sight. All
the fine differences by which we distin
guish the various fruits, meats and drinks
depend not upon taste at all, but upon
these other senses. Pure sensations of
taste add hardly more than a certain emo
tional element to the complex sensations
Sweet things we call "good," and bitter
the least taint of sentlmentallsm or af
fectation, and I think a coarse-flbered
designation like 'Slabsides' will grow con
stantly more significant and pleasing,
while one would tire of a nams that wu
merely pretty."
The interior of the cabin Is hardly leaÂ«
rustic than Its outer aspect. There are
no carpets or rugs, the unhewn Joists of
the floor above are exposed and have still

things we call "bad," while salt and sour
add a certain piquancy, which is pleasing
when not excessive.
A partial proof of these facts may be
given by merely blindfolding the eyes and
closing the nose and taking various kinds
of foods and drinks lhto the mouth with
out swallowing them. It will then he
found that it is quite impossible to dis
tinguish many of the commonest foods
and drinks.
It is always difficult to eliminate the
sense of smell in normal subjects. Pro
fessor Patrick was able, however, by ex
perimenting with a subject possessing 1 no
sense of smell whatever, and comparing
the results with those obtained from nor
mal subjects, to get more accurate results
ns to the more important part, played by
smell in distinguishing foods and drinks.
It is, of course, generally known that
what is popularly mistaken for the taste
of coffee, tea and wine is only their aroma
or odor. By these experiments, however.
It was shown that coffee and tea have a
distinct taste, which is simply bitter, and
cannot be distinguished from a weak so
lution of quinine. A weak Infusion of
coffee or tea, however, cannot be dis
tingulshed from water. Even with nor
mal subjects, with the eyes and nose
closed, twenty experiments with coffee
gave the following results: It was called
"coffee" once, "bitter" eleven times,
"quinine", four times, "tea" three times,
and "milk" once.

The feature of all others that he takes
pride in Is the great stone chimney. It
is warranted to draw well in all weath

a fireplace that in amplitude rivals those

since she was wrecked, a portion of her masts and some of her
yards are still standing, while the hull from the companion
waj aft and from the foremast forward is intact, and to nil
appearances as sound as when the ship was launched. Amid
ships the seas have made clean breaches through the hull and
nothing remains but the keel nrid keelsons.
The New York was formerly the American ship T. F.
Cakes, and was biiilt in ISS:?, being the first sailing vessel evnr
built of iron in America. Sh" was never a lucky ship, and it
was in hopis that a change of name would do away with the
hoodoo that induced her owners to rechriften her "New York."
She was on her way here from Hongkong when she was lost.
Early in the morning of March 13, 1898, the people of Half
moon Bay saw a ship standing inshore. The people aboard did
not appear to know Just exactly where they were, but finally
the vessel was put about and stood out to sea. How it hap
pened was never discovered, but the ship's course must have
been changed again during a thick fog that came up, and that
night at 8:30 o'clock the New York was hard and fast on the
beach of Halfmoon Bay.
Captain Peabody, now master of the American ship "Wills
cott, was in charge of the New York and he and his family had
a narrow escape. The vessel had a valuable cargo, which was

blundering.
"People who handle the yardstick have but little idea of the
years of study and experiments that were necessary to secure
the standard yard measure," observed an official of the coast
Burvey. "Bird, a famous scientist, made the first standard
yard in 1760, but the English Government did not legalize it
until 1524.
"Ten ypars afterward, when the House of Parliament In
London was destroyed by fire, the standard yard was lost, and
England was aeain without a standard yard of length. Sheeps
hanks next made a standard yard measure, which the English
Government adopted, and, so that it could not be again de-
Ptroyed by fire, four authorized copies were made of it. One
of these was deposited in the Royal Mint, another in the Royal
Society, another in the observatory at Greenwich, and the
fourth was imbedded in the walls of the new House of Parlia
ment.
"The standard yard measures which are owned by the Gov
ernment are copies of the original, one of which Is owned by
the coast survey. The United States Naval Observatory has
one also.
"The delicacy of its construction may he gathered by the
fact that a change of temperature of one-hundredth of a degree
Fahrenheit has been found to produce a sensible effect on the
length of the bar.
"The copies of the standard are made of bronze, for thÂ« rea
son that bronze is lees affected by temperature than any distinct
or single metal.
"The cost of the construction of the original standard yard
measure involved the labor of Bird and his assistants for nÂ«any
six years. Sheepshanks -was eleven years in producing the ac

Speaking for myself, there never was
a time when Dwight L. Moody was in
Buch demand as he is to-day. You
would not credit the facts regarding the
world-wide request for my services.
For many years I have never made a
promise to be at a certain place by a
certain day. I cannot do it. When I
hold a revival in a town, I cannot tell
when It may end. It would be folly to
break off a blessed season of revival
when my Judgment tells me I Bhould
not do so merely because I was due at
gome other place, like a train. Even
now I am six months behind some of
the dates that were fixed for me, and I
do not know how much longer will
elapse before they are kept. This goes
to prove that evangelical, work is as
popular as ever, if I may use such a
term.
You may, if you please, introduce into
the world a new form of so-called re

kind of thing has gone on foT centuries,
and yet what do we find when an evan
gelist comes along?
I will tell you what we find. We find
a bigger demand than ever for the real
old gospel, and this demand is actually
increased because there have been so
many sideshows attempting to rob it of
its. beauty. Anybody that has been
forced to eat crow for twelve months
would relish turkey for a few days, and
this principle is as true in spiritual
matters as in temporal.
Since the first tweive evangelists were
sent on their way the number has
steadily grown. There never were less
tha-n- twelve. Their work also grows,
long after they have departed.

er than at other times. This has been
so from the time when the believers
were first called Christians at Antioch.
History tells us that at certain periods
in certain countries the tyrant and the
oppressor have publicly proclaimed
that r.ot a Christian existed within
their dominions, but what was the
truth in each case? Xo sooner was
such a false boast made than the
Christians rallied and increased more
than ever and proved the falsity of
such statements.
This century now nearlng Its close
has been one of the most marvelous in
regard to the work of evangelists. This
has been in reality an evangelical cen
tury. You could begin ninety-nine
years ago and easily recall a -long list
of men and women "who have moved

There Is no such thing as localism

talk all you like about the excellent

the genuine article even if its face bore
the evidence of having been well
rubbed. And it makes no difference
whether he be an American or an Eng
lishman, a Canadian or a Frenchman,
or a Hindu. None of them like counter
feits. I have been for forty years
spreading the seed of Christianity all
over the globe, and I have never yet
conducted a revival where there were
not genuine conversions. Perhaps no
other single man on earth has such a

Sketched from life.
Mr. Moody does not change. Twenty-five years ago in a little English town I heard him for the first
time, and barring a few more gray hairs and possibly a wrinkle or two he is the same earnest evangelist.
No one talks with him long before being impressed with two facts: One, that the man sincerely bolieves
what he says; the other, that he considers it his duty to lead his fellow beings into the same belief. Mr.
Moody somewhat resembles General Booth. Both are desperately in earnest;
get there. I will go, of course, go any
where if I live long enough, but I can't
fix ,the time.
Here is another letter from Lord Over
ton from Scotland, asking me to let
nothing prevent, my going there as soon
as possible. He tells me of the hun
dreds of churches and the thousands of
Christians that have signed a petition
requi sting me to visit the land of Burns^,
p.nd what is it all for?
To see Moody? Not a bit of It. To
hear Professor Tc-wner lead the choir?
Not by any means. It is simply a repe
tition of the argument that they want
to hear the same old gospel preached
on the same lines as were followed by
the Savior on the njount, and by the
dozen evangelists that he sent out.
Here is another invitatk-n with 15,831
signers from Australia making the same
request; and it is a fair sample of the
others. When I get back to Chicago I
dare not think what I shall find.

to be thankful for. You are doing welt
Public interest in and the result from
evangelical work comes around in cy
cles. California has just commenced on
a new cycle. Of course, you maj' not
notice it as I do. I have not been in this
State for ten years, and I can see the
difference. There is a wonderful im
provement, and it has stretched into the
most remote corners of the State. lam
happy tn see that it has not been con
fined to the town, but there are little
halls and barns and gospel wagons and
traveling evangelists scattered all over,
each one doing its part faithfully.
This is as it should be. The work of
spreading Christianity should not be
spasmodic. It should be permanent
and thorough, and when a man takes
it up he should make it as completely
his business to obey his Divine Master's
command to go into all the world and
preach the .gospel to every creature as
a jnan considers it his business to serve
faithfully his employer, who pays him
his salary in dollars and cents.
California has improved vastly in a
religious way since my last visit, and
I can ccc the change very plainly. I
have just taken a flying trip over
Southern California and am delighted
and astonished at the marked increase
of interest in religious affairs, and at
the spread of good work everywhere.
The religious tone of the State seems
to be far ahead of what it has ever
been before. All the same places have
been reached and the grand work of
evangelization is being organized, and
in organization lies the secret of suc
cess.
Ten years ago California's Christians
paid little attention to the unhappy
beings within her jails and prisons.
But now this work is a special branch
and is being attended to systematically
with splendid results.
Another gratifying feature is that
there are now two hundred gospel wa
gons. Just think of it. An average of
nearly four to every county in the
State going over the highways and into
the little heard of townships and doing
work hitherto neglected. I am told
that in some townships this gospel wa
gon work has been so thorough that not
a single inhabitant has been missed by
the evangelists, and in every instance
there are conversions.
Does this look as if the work of the
evangelists was passing?
Among the ministers of California
revival work is more popular than
ever. On my present trip I have seen
more unity of action than on the four
previous ones, and investigation proves
that the results of revivals are for the
greater part lasting. I shall remain in
California but a few weeks more, and
while here I am moving around too
quickly to be able to obtain an idea of
what the results may be. But I am
just as confident as ever that in the
future my mail will bring me proofs of
the good results accomplish. il.
Is the old evangelical religion becom
ing stale and is the Bible less popular
than it ever was?
I should say not. I have been asked
that question scores of times. Not lone
since a member of the staff of the New
York Sun asked me that question.
We had a discussion in the Sun edi
torial room and it was remarked that
the Bible was getting out of date and
that the people were reading Sunday
newspapers. One of tne editors sent
me out to investigate, and I found that
more Bibles had been sold in New
York in the last three years than ever
before. Why? In one department
store in Philadelphia they are selling
tons of Bibles. The old book is not
worn out yet; let me tell you that
more Bibles have been sold In the last
eight years than in the preceding 1800
years. ,If I read the papers aright,

I DO not believe at all in the fatalist
creed which makes of us all mere
puppets and holds out no incentive
to strive for higher and better things
than which come to us without effort.
Concerning ourselves and our rela
tion to this world, no living person
knows or can know more than two
things: We have come into it, and we
are destined to go out of it. We can
believe anything we choose, but we can
know only this. My belief is that our
lives are ruled by Providence, but that
our own efforts assist very materially
In determining our successes or our
failures. Nobody can fail â¢ to realize
that there is some wonderful creative

during the past few days even the
Pope has advised the whole Christian
world to read the Bible every day.
In Chicago I have my Bible institute
and in connection with it I have a iarg*
Bible class, with a .membership if be-'
tween 6000 and 7000. There are 1100 stu
dents and from sixty to seventy pro
fessora in the faculty, and do you know,
I pay more to a man who can teach the
Bible than to any one who can teach
Greek or Latin.
I have no sympathy with modern
ministers, who believe in a part of the
Bible. It is a calamity for any child of
God to begin to pick the word of God
to pieces. When a man is filled with,
the spirit he gets along pretty well with
the Bible. When he commences to be
come "intellectual" he never knows,
where he will end.
He begins by saying, "I believe some
of the word of God, but I don't believe
it all. I don't believe in some of those
stories of the Old Testament, the story
of Lot's wife, Jonah and the whale,
and the feeding of the children of
Israel with manna and quail in the
dt -<Â»-rt."
When a Christian talks that way and
gets wiser than the son of God he had
better get out of the pulpit. Christ Bet
the seal r f his approval upon almost
everything in the Old Testament that
men cavil about. He connected the
story of Jonah with his own resurrec
tion. When a man begins to cavil at
the story of Jonah in a few months he
will begin to doubt the resurrection of
Christ. Then his hold on the people
will relax; they will become lukewarm
and as soon as an evangelist comes
along they will swarm to hear him tell
of the good old doctrine oÂ£ hell and
heaven.
As the nineteenth century closes I
can look back and rejoice over the pro
gress that Chrtetiunity has made in
that time. It has steadily gone on and
on in every country when it lias been
carried, and it has been carried into
many new countries since the birth of
this century.
All the great inventions of this cen
tury have helped the cause of Chris
tianity. Th, speedy means of trans
portation, whether by steam or elec
tricity, have all been made use of by
those who are carrying on the work
of evangelists.
It is a lie to say that infidelity is in
creasing. There are probably more
atheists to-day than thftre were, but
there are infinitely more Christians in
proportion.
The researches of science and the
marvelous discoveries of the nineteenth
century nave materially aided in the
support of the truths, principles and
history of Christianity, and although
every means have been taken by those
'who would distort the word of God to
make it appear that these discoveries
substantiate their position, they have
invariably failed.
It is the easiest thing in the world
to tear down. It is the hardest thing
to build, and the best proof of the sta
bility of a structure is the amount of
effort and persistence required to tear
it down.
Nearly two thousand years ago Jesua
Christ completed- the structure of Chris
tianity. Since that time every evil
minded person and the strength of
kings has been used to tear it down,
but without effect. And to-day that
structure stands upon a firmer foun
dation than when the keystone of its
arch was placed on Calvary's hillside.
And yet some of our critics tell us
that Christianity is stale; that the
Bible is worn out, and that the work
of the evangelist is passing.

SARAH BERNHARDT`S
STORY OF HER OWN LIFE
Special to The Sunday CalL
FOR some time past Mme. Sarah
gfrnhardt has been engaged in
n . r ,. ine her "Memoirs," and an
nalian journalist, Signor Gaetano
Barbel was recently fortunate
enough 'to be permitted to copy
Serest to the numerous admirers of the
* r Â£L?%!th* glad to know how and
ss s= srss
he^Pr h 7r r in-a millinery shop/ said my
godfather. 'That will be her *Â»Â«Â«â¢
Lace and rags will be her element. The
little one Is too smart not to succeed in
it.' An old friend of my mother, how
ever, who was then Minister, remarked
that the theater offered to me a great
probability of success, and my mother
was of the same opinion. I was not ugly,
and I had what is bettor, namely, a sweet
voice and beautiful teeth, so that T could
smile. I was growing very rapidly, with
a pronounced tendency to become fat. No
body could suppose then that my leanness
would in after years give journalists such
a grand opportunity to make fun of me.
To be brief, it was arranged that Emile
de Girardin should introduce me to M.
Auber.
"My mother, being: Dutch, and not hav
| ing the slightest idea how I should begin
my theatrical career, it was necessary for
my aunt to explain everything to her in
Dutch. The two talked a long time to
the Minister. I was sitting alone in a
corner of the drawing-room with the fear
of the unknown ever before me. I was
thinking, What w.lll be my future? Happy
dreams filled my imagination, though
meanwhile as T listened to my two little
sisters playing in the next room I could
not help feeling sad. The rude accents of
the Dutch language were beating in my
I head, and the mysterious voices of the
speakers in the next room produced in me
a real uneasiness. I heard my godfather
and the Minister talking, and I felt so un
happy that I burst into tears. Just then

The affair was remarkably well attended
considering the poor weather The at
tendance was so great that it became
necessary to open the I'nion Square Hall
for the benefit of the* dancers. An elan
orate programme was rendered, cacti
number of which was heartily encored.
Among those who took part in the even
ing's entertainment were: Mrs. K. &â

Club was held Thursday evening, March

of the evening was the handsome gowns
worn by the young ladies present. * Rom
all indications the club promises to have
a bright future.
my mother and aunt and the two men
approached me.
" 'Why do you cry?' asked my mother,
caressing me tenderly. 'Don't you want to
be an actress?'
" 'I want to be a nun,' I whispered
through my sobs.
" 'You are a fool,' exclaimed my aunt,
shaking me by the shoulder. ' 'Girls nowa
days are really very stupid,' remarked
my godfather.
" 'Go and dress yourself,' said my
mother, 'and don't cry-'
"I kissed my mother tenderly, without
being able to utter a word, and as I left
the drawing room I somewhat regained
my composure.
"On the following day I was Introduced
to M. Girardin, who found me nice and
charming, and a little like Rachel. Ho
promised to take care of me, and he kept
his word. In fact two days later my
mother received a letter from him asking
her to be at the Conservatorium on such
a date. Then came the dressmaker, and
instructions were given to have a black
s!lk dress ready for me to wear on the
eventful day. On the sam" day a hair
dresser was called in, and he curled and
twisted my hair as much as possible, the
result being that when the task was
over my godfather declared that I
looked like a grown girl' and no more
like a mad dog. The short skirt showed
my embroidered underwear, and in the
sleeves, which were made expressly large,
my very thin arms swung loosely. A cor
al necklace attempted to cover in some
measure the thinness and length of my
neck.
"I have not forgotten the powder, of
which my eyebrows and ears were full.
Tricked out in this fashion I was simply
horrible. and when I was introduced to
Auber in company with many other girls,
who were white and pink and nice, he
shook his shoulders, and, muttering
'Why, Girardin is a fool,' he did not
deign to give me another look.
"My nurse let me understand that the
ceremony of introduction was finished and
we went away. The usher put down my
name and informed Mllo. 9e Rrandeber,
my nurse, that the examination for ad
mission would take place in a few days.
" 'What lessons shall I prepare for It?'
I asked him.
" Whatever you like,' was the reply.
"As soon as I reached home a discus
sion bfgan as to the subject which should
he selected for the examination. My
mother, being a foreigner, was unable to
select anything. My piano teacher, be
ing the daughter of a theatrical celebrity,
suggested that I should learn some
verses. My godfather, on the other hand,
suggested a fable. The discussion grew
very lively. Somebody thought it stupid
to recite a fable, yet my godfather's ad
vice prevailed. He had heard Rachel re
cite La Fontaine's 'Fable of Two Pig
eons," and this was finally selected.
"At once a search was made for the
book of fables and, while my mother was
embroidering and my friends were play
ing, while my piano teacher was whis
pering to the Count de X., and my god
father was coughing, I began to study
the "Fable of the Two Pigeons."
"That was one of the most dreadful
evenings of my whole life.
"At last the great day arrived. My hair
on this occasion was not arranged by
the hair dresser, and I appeared at the
Conservatorium in my usual style, with
my little girlish face and my customary
childish self-possession. Many other
young girls were there, handsome, nice
and charming, some talking with anima
tion, others pale and trembling. Each
had hope in the heart arid fear in the
eyes.
"When I was called upon I was fright
ened, and I felt a strong desire to run
away. I went into the room more dead
than alive. All around a large table sat
several gentlemen, talking and arguing.
At the end of the room was a young man
dressed in black and with two large black
eyes. This waa Leotand.
11 'What are you going to recite?" he
asked.
"The 'Fable of Two Pigeons,' I mur
mured, in a very low voice.
" -This is not the place in which to re
cite fables,' he replied, with a laugh.
"Then, as a bell rang, he whispered,
'Make a bow,' and I looked around among
those who were facing me In March of
some one who might Inspire me with con
fidence. For a second I hoped that Au
ber would be the one, but his mocking
smile deterred mo. lie saw hoi* 1 t. li.
and he pointed mo out to M. August."
Brohan, who began to laugh. Tears Mli.-d
my eyes, and only a gentle look of <\i
mille Domet save me a little courage. I
began the fable and I went through It
in one breath.
" "Little one.' said Auber, 'do you know
anything else?'
" 'Yes.' I replied, 'I know the scone
from "Agnese," but not too well."
" 'Well, recke what you know. 1
"When I was through and about to
leave the room Auber turned to the othor
gentlemen and said, 'She's a very m,-,
little girl.' Another gentleman said â¢]
will take her in my class and make some
thing of her.' The speaker was M. Pro
vost. I kissed him and ran away, vny
happy. I was accepted.
"The first time I went to my course* at
the Conservatorium M. Provost made first
the boys and then the girls recito some
thing. When my turn came I was trem
bling with shame. I had learned the role
of Junia in 'Brltannicus' and immediately
I became for Provost a subject of sad
mockery. I could not vibrate or pro
nounce with such emphasis as to give me
a German accent. After I had recited a
few verses Provost mad P me sit down
and declared he would not-glv* me an'
more lessons until I. had learned how to
vibrate. I was consoled by Mile, de Bran
deber, and I tried hard to succeed.
i "â¦>,*'*Â£ c Â° ntinua "y chewing rubber balls
in the hope of thus learning how to vi

from morning until evening and often
from evening till morning I did nothing
.but pronounce alone in my room tl. di, tl

at last was able to accomplish this diffi
cult task."
The "Memoirs," it is said, will contain
a complete a6count of the author's career
on the stage, and, !f only for this reason,
it is safe to say that they will prove high
ly interesting to the reading public.

in the
Biggest Trust irv the World.
T T ERR TAUSCHER, Mme. Gadski's
husband, is almost as important a
"~ personage in the military world as
the great soprano is in that of mv
- - -*â¢ sic. She. of course, retains for pro
fessional purposes the name under
which she. won her fame. He ranks high
In what is probably the biggest trust in
the world to-day.
Herr Tatischer accompanies his wife on
hor present tour, and is now in this city.
H.> is assistant director Of the German
Arms and Ammunition Factory of Efr
>in. The company is capitalized at over
$100,000,000, and controls the world's mar
kets in military firearms. An army of
20,000 men is employed In its various
works day and ni^ht. constantly turning
out rifles," pistols and smokeless powdt r.
The daily output of the works controlled
by the trust is 2500 rifles and 1 .000 .000 car
tridges., if they are run to their full ca
pacity, besides an almost indefinite quan
tity of other munitions of war.
One of the principal articles produrofl
by the company is the famous Mauser
rifle, which was used by the Spanish sol
diers in the recent war. During the last
ten years the company has supplied va
rious governments with over 3,009,000 rifles
of the Mauser pattern. The trust deals
mainly with governments, filling immense
orders, and it is now negotiating with
Germany to supply that nation with an
enormous number of Mauser rifles, which
have come to be regarded as the best
rifles made, in point of precision, pene
tration and simplicity of mechanism. Tho
present pattern is the result of fifteen
years' experimenting with smokeless re
peaters.
The three departments of the trust
which manufacture the Mauser repeating
rifle and its ammunition are the Berlin.
Karlsruhe and the Grotzingen Loading
Works. In the Berlin factories over 3000
machines are operated for the production
of small arms. Each separate piece of
the rifle is taken ;is an entity, and there
are some 1070 distinct operations on earn
rifle. The main works in Karlsruhe are
devoted to the manufacture of cartridge
shells, bullets and loading clips. There
is also a large branch for the manufac
ture of cartridges and the elements of
ammunition. At the Gn>tzing<en Loading
Works, near Karlsruhe, the shells are
primed, loaded and picked. Percussion
caps and primers of all descriptions are
made at tf)urlach. Tn tiie three depart
ments over 2400 machines are in use. Each
of the.se works has its own shooting
range, where all the neoe"ssary tests are
made for the various elements of a car
tridge. The works in Oberndorf on tha
Neckar have 2100 machines for the manu
facture of tools, drop hammers and ma
chinery for the carrying out of special
operations only. The cartridge and load
ing clip undergo some eighty-three dis
tinct operations in thoir production.

Neckar originally belonged to Paul
Mauser, the inventor of the rifle, but it
was absorbed by the combine and he waa
made director of the rifle department. Tha
other concerns controlled by the big trust
are the National Factory of Liege, Bel
gium employing 2500 hands; the Hungary
\rm? and Machine Works of Buda-Pesth,
the Cologne-Rottweiler Powder Factory,
besides all the principal powder works in
Germany.
In addition to all these the trust haa
an immense electrical department and
owns tho rig-hts for all Europe of the
Union Electrical Company and the
Thomson-Houston Electric Company of
Boston. The electric cars for European
street railways will all be constructed by
the trust.
One of the most important productions
ny the German Arms Compaay is thÂ«
Maxim machine gun. which has been sup
plied to the German and other navies.
Another step forward in the progress of
firearm technique has also been made in
the Borchardt automatic rifle and pistol,
which loads automatically by the recoil.
All that is necessary to operate this fire
arm is the pulling of the trigger. There
is no recoil, for the recoil is taken up to
work the mechanism. The rifle carries
to in*Xt yards and is effective at 500. It
weierhs but three pounds in all. and can
be carried almost as easily as a pair of
opera glasses. It has been tested in the
United States Armory at Springfield,
where the functions of the mechanism for
a single shot were found to occupy less
than one-twenty-fifth part of a second.

ly all of Miss Fair's costumes
have been designed or suggested by Miss
Fair herself.
Many of the gowns are exceedingly
and yet so smart In effect that
rgets their severity.
/Ul Kinds of QoWrvs.
One of the prettiest of these simple
- is of sheerest, finest Ivory-white
china silkâ the kind that has a sheen and
shimmer. This is most beautifully made
r a rich rose-pink china silk, which
glows through the white slik like the

effect of the clear white and pink, set off

With this gown Miss Fair will wear a
hat of rough sunburnt straw laden
: trge, full-blown pink rose?.' and a
tall cockade at one side of black velvet
loops, and there are long streamers of
Mack velvet down the back, attached to
the hat by square buckles of fine-cut
Fteql and brilliants.
An exquisite gown for carriage and

Beautiful E\terving Dresses
With this gown Mfsa Fair will wear a
very unusual hat and one after her own
exclusive design, with no thanks to
French milliners for any of the sugges
tions.
It is of long- stems of flowers made over
a frame and caught down at intervals.
It is turned up at the back and worn a lit
tle forward. It is trimmed with a wreath
or circulet of purple grapes, and large
grape leaves and black velvet rosettes
are tucked under the . turned-up back
A cockade of lace is the basis for a mass
of live black paradise plumes.
There are many evening dresses in th
outfit, and one of the prettiest of them
Is of white India gauze with trimmings of
gold and rosettes made of pin
gauze with green leaves. The skirt
trails beautifully about the feet
and is very long- at the back. The whole
skirt Is flounced with deep plisse
flounces of the tulle embroidered delicate
ly at the edge with gold thread and gold
sequins.
The whole body is covered with richest;
closest gold embroidery. It is cut very,
low and has no sleeves â only little wisps
of tulle below the shoulder and bands of
gold filigree over the shoulder itself. The
rosettes of pink gauze look like roses an
they have gold thread in the center to
look like the hearts of flowers. These dec
orate the corsage at one side, and trail
ing out from them over the white flesh
and down the front are leaves made of
pale green gauze edged with gold thread.
These were made by the dressmaker at
Miss Fair's suggestion and the effect of
the gauze leaves and roses against the
white tulle with the gold is fairy-like in
its delicacy.
Dreams of the Jailor.
Another evening gown of quite a differ
ent type is all of lace, excepting the tiny
edge of the skirt. which peeps below the
long lace redingote. This is of soft liber
ty satin in a creamy -white. This lace
dress is a creamy ecru and it fits the fig
ure like a new French glove, the seams
being held tight all the way with feath
erbone. It fastens in the back and is
decollete. Where it fastens there are lit
tle yellow velvet buttons, and a cluster
of black velvet roses with yellow centers
crosses one shoulder.
There are sleeves to this gown, but they
do not extend to the shoulder, looking
more like long mitts.
This gown also trails about the feet
and is exceedingly close-fitting about the
hips, giving an effect of extreme slender
nessâan effect, by the way, which Miss
Fair cultivates in all her gowns.
To Jump from evening robes to street
gowns is to tell about a handsome tailor
gown -which Miss Fair intends to wear
soon after her marriage â fact, it may
be intended as the going-away gown. This
is of light weight spring broadcloth of
the new variety, which has a surface al
most like, satin. It is of a lovely shade
of silver gray, made up ,with strapped
seams and numerous strap decorations.
The gown is odd because of its little
cutaway coat rounding down to a rather
long tab-like tail at the back. This coat
opens broadly In front and has two waist
coats, one of a sort of dull peacock green
and the other of a rich mauve cloth. They
open one over the other, and show a
ruffled shirt of white silk mull or grass
linen. The combination of these two pecu
liar colors with the clear silver gray is
very fetching and decidedly foreign
looking.
Dresses for Ordinary Wear!
A turban of black tulle, jetted finely.
Is to he worn with this gown, and it has
for trimming a single tall white plume in
front, held by a large ornament of fine
cut steel.
The most practical and plain gown in
all the wedding outfit is of navy blue
lightweight serge. This Is made up with
a coat bodice, opening over a bright scar
let vest fastened with gold buttons. There
is a finely tucked shirt of finest white
linen, with a standing collar and mascu
line tie.
Brick-colored gloves and a large rough
straw turban after the Spanish toreador
style will be worn with this gown. A
walking stick will also be carried and a
single magnifying eyeglass will dangle
from a fine gold chain about the neck.
There are a dozen fine white linen shirt
waists for hot summer days, and these
have the yokes and front pieces embroid
ered by hand as delicately as a pocket
handkerchief. They have very high stock
collars, with bows and ends in front, and
white pearl dumbbell studs are in each
cuff, to show how simple are the acces
sories of a shirt waist. Women worth a
few thousands would probably have gold
studs set with diamonds, but not so with
the future Mrs. Vanderbilt.
There are some lovely fresh white pique
gowns also for the hot summer days, and
these have little Jackets, most beautifully
enriched with white braiding, one gown
having the pique cut away in places under
the embroidery.
There is one beautiful, dainty white
muslin with a long, floating skirt covered
with little inch-deep ruffles and having
the bodice set in with the most delicate
needlework. The arms and neck show
through plainly in this, and a pale-blue
sash ties about the waist.
A hat of leghorn heaped, with tumbling
white ostrich plumes will be worn with
this, and will make it an ideal summer
toilet such as one reads about in old
fashioned poetry.

FASHION`S
FRILLS
THE very latest edict as regards
Easter gowns will not be ready
for the public eye until next
week. But from the fountain
head of fashion comes the lat
est as to Easter etceteras.
The trimmings for gowns have had the
definite seal of Dame Fashion placed up
on them. There Is no longer a doubt as
to what Is to be and what Is not to be.
First and foremost, trimmings are ro
lng to be dreadfully expensive. The won
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL,, SUNDAY, MARCH 26, 1899.
derfr.l "mark-down" pales of trimmings
which several of the large shops held re
cently was sufficient clue to the initiated
that it was simply a case of "ring out the
old, ring in the new," for trimmings have
never been fixtures always worth their
price. Once out of style, they are worth
less, though they cost their weight in
gold. In the course of events they come
into fashion again, but it is a dreary
waiting.
The cynics who rail at women for ever
seeking something new in fashion forget
that it is usually a man who starts the
ball a-rolling. Nine out of ten of the nov
elties in fabrics or trimmings are the re
sult of man's ingenuity, and every time
it is a man who stands sponsor for Fash
inn s whims. Madame de Mode is really
a man who seeks safety in the feminine
gender.
Only flat trimmings in braid, chenille
and lace effect* will be vised on cloth, and
there is a hint of embroidery.
On thinner materials, garlands, motifa
and all-overs, composed of combinations
of laces, chenille, net. ribbon work and
paillettes are in vogue. Taffetas, elab
orately wrought in chenille alone or com
bined with silver and gold cord or braid,
and cut out in lace design, are used for
trimmings, yokes, sleeves and even en
tlre !>â¢
Jetted things we have always with us,
and Parisians are wearing incrustations
of jet on white cloth and other ap
pliques. Jetted corsages and bodices of
jet galloon severe in effect are quite the
sweuest things.
The beauty of the new embroidery ran
nnt be overrated. It is gorgeous, glitter
ingly beautiful and at the same time
harmonious. It goes to make a dream of
a gown and a nightmare of a bill.
The popularity of fringe trimming is by
no means on the wane. The very nfwest
design falls from an openwork* founda
tion such as our great-grandmothers
wore on their priceless siFk shawls.
Children must not be neglected in this
season of furnishing the spring wardrobe.
Serge has for years played an important
part in the schoolgirl s wardrobe, but this
season finds the softer materials more in
demand. Cheviots and lightweight
tweeds are considered the most durable
fabrics for hard wear, while cashmere,
voile and the plain wool and silk veil
ings are utilized for dressy gowns.
Girls over 8 years nf age wear shirt
waists and skirts, which is a most sensi
ble and economical plan. The best skirt
is the five-gored affair that fits not too
tightly over the hips, has a proper full
ness at the waist In the back and flares
at the bottom in the regulation grown-up
manner.
Such a skirt is worn with wash or sum
mer silk shirt waists and a smart reefer
or coat of plain cloth of the predom-

TO-DAY my talk shall be ror trie
bt neflt of those p">or sutlering m<r
tals afflicted with red noses. It's
pre^y tough, I know, girls, to be
obliged to go through life with the
danger signal forever hoisted, and from
the number of letters that come to me on
this subject, there must be a lot of you
that are thus afflicted. In such cases one
is apt tn pive such free rein to the im
agination that I doubt not many of these
Fame girls feel perfectly confident that
were they to find themselves within a
bull rir.g it would only be necessary to
flourish the flambuoyant nasal appendage
of the wild animal to infuriate
him to all sorts of deeds of madness. But
never mind, be that nose eVer BO rosy, I
am surt- I can tÂ«*ll you of somtthinjr that
will restore it to Its pristine fairness.
A red nose is one of those distressing
things that comes without respect of per
son. Nor Is it always as stems to be the
popular belief an indication of overindul
:;i the flowing bowl.
ir <-om> s from such a variety of causes
that It Is difficult to suggest a universal
cure. It may be the result of a weakened
circulation; It may come from some stom
â  rangf-nunr. <;r from corsets, bands
or other garments which are so tight as
to Impede the circulation. Sometimes the
caused by too rough usage
with the handkerchief and very often it
la due to a tendency to erysipelas.
First of all. lind out the cause. Until
that Is removed outward applications will
only alleviateâ they will not curt-. If the
cause is poor circulation, contact with the
cold air will expose the fact by quickly
â iing a nose that is ordinarily of a
normal lint. Told hand's and feet art;
often an accompaniment of this condition,
which may bo remedied by frequrnt exer
clse In thÂ« open air, massage, warm baths
and hot loot baths. Sometimes it is nec
t-ssary to restore a weakened circulation
Dy tonics, which should only be taken
under the advice of one's physician. If
the circulation is restricted by outer
causes, equalize it by removing the occa
sioning pnssur>'.
When during or after a hearty meal the
nose becomes scarlet and seems to in
crease in size, it is an indication that too
much has been imposed upon the organs
uf digestion, which have rebelled, sending
the blood to the extremities.
In such cases I would suggest reducing
th.Â» quantity of food and eating only such
as will easily digest. A laxative diet of
vegetables and fruit will be found par
ticularly beneficial in cases of red or
shiny noses. If the redness comes, as it
frequently does, from a clogged or un
healthy condition of the pores of the
skin, remedy )t by frequent bathing in
warm water, using a flesh brush and
pienty of pure castile soap. Also use the
face scrubbing brush freely on the nose.
After the supposed cause has been re
moved and the nose still seems to ab
sorb all the color of the face, then try
outward applications. Witchhazel, al
lowed to dry on, and followed by a liberal
smearing with cold cream, is sometimes
all that is necessary. If this treatment is
not effectual and the red nose comes from
inflammation of the skin, try a lotion
made of rosewater and carbolic acid
three drops of the acid to four ounces
of the rosewater. A paste made
of one part of glycerine, two
parts of water and enough
refined chalk to make
into a paste is often ef
ficacious in reduc
ing the inflam
mation. This
should be
spread
inating color in the skirt. For later use
pique or duck skirts can be made after
the same skirt model.
An exceedingly pretty gown for a child
is of the new nun's veiling in one of the
fashionable reddish tints, and lias a white
yoke collar and epaulets outlined with
braid. . . ,
Pretty gowns of thin soft materials
have the skirts trimmed with chiffon
ruchings, and cream or white lace is in
variably Introduced on the bodice. Child
ish figures need something in the way of
revers epaulets or big collars to give the
gown the proper style. Wash fabrics for
children, such as gingham, lawn, cam
bric percale and the like, are beautiful
in coloring and dainty in design. For the
most part they are Inexpensive and do
up well. These look their best when
made with a gored skirt, with an at
tached graduated flounce, not too wide.
The waists are usually shirred or tucked
on full to a yoke of white tucking or all
over embroidery, which is outlined by a
cord of the material and a frill of em
broidery Puffs are noted on few full
sleeves, which are extremely small.
A word about cleaning, which is an im
portant part of the spring making over.
In nine cases out of ten things can be
cleaned just as well at home as at the
cleaner's. The secret of the so-called
â¢'dry cleaning" is very simple. The
thing that is to be cleaned is merely im
mersed in gasoline and left covered with
the liquid for twenty-four hours. A reg
ular wash boiler is the best vessel to
use, as it can be covered, and by throw
ing' a blanket over the tin cover remain
nearly enough airtight.
After the clothes have soaked a day
and night it will be time to lift them
out. They should not be rubbed, but
soused up and down in the gasoline.
Sometimes if they are really very dirty
they may not be clean even then, in
which case it is best to cover them with
fresh gasoline and leave them another
Here Is a way to get rid of the smell
of gasoline that so often clings to home
cleaned clothes in spite of much frantic
airing and shaking and sunning. It must
be heated out.
When the fabric is thoroughly dry place
it over the radiator or steam pipes, or if
these are unavailable cover it with n thin
cloth and drive the scent out by going
over it well with a hot iron. After all
traces of the gasoline are dispelled from
the woolen stuff then renovate it entire
ly put it right side up on an ironing
board, cover it with a damp cloth and
go over with a hot iron, helng careful to
lift the wet cloth as you move the iron.
This gives the 3team a chance to com*
up from the wool and raise the nap of
the c!,,th. This lifting of the wot cloth
in time to let the steam lift the nap up
is a particular point In renovating cloth.
If. on the other hand, the fabric is
ironed dry through the wet cloth the nap
upon the nose and allowed to remain as
long as convenient, then gently ami care
fully removed and the nose wiped off with
a soft cloth.
People with rosy-tinted noses should
deny themselves all rich and hlglrty sea
soned foods, hot. strong tea or coffee and
every form of stimulant. They should not
eat fresh pork, ham, sausage or bacon.
High, stiff collars, tight belts and sleeves
must also be foresworn.
Where the nose is oily or shiny bathe
it nightly with diluted spirits of cam
phor or water in which a little borax has
been dissolved. When tt is -both red and
shiny without being oily it may be bathed
with tepid water and cologne, dried and
then anointed with cold cream. In a.
few minutes the cream should be removed
and a little rice powder rubbed on.

MICHIGAN has become the thea
ter of events quite as important
as those occurring and about to
occur in Wisconsin. A Bachelor
Girls 1 Association has been formed there
with the object of organizing societies in
every township and city, the members of
which shall pledge themselves not to en
tertain proposals of marriage until they
are thirty.
It is never too late to mend, of course,
but we can't help thinking that should
the association thrive and prosper there
will be many a good time lost. "Comme
je regret te non temps perdu" is a song
with which Beranger acquainted ladies
of a certain age. The air is plaintive, and
so is the sentiment. A woman who holds
off until she is 30 misses her vocation,
misses, too, the charm of youth and of
life. The poets are right. Nothing re
sembles happiness so well as love. To en
tertain proposals of marriage is only less
able than making fhem. It is the
most fascinating of nature's inventions.
There is an art in it also which cornea
but through practice and experience, and
of which real mastery requires an early
start. It is never too late to begin, but it
is never too soon, either. For that mat
ter, the sooner the bettor.

Edwin Danforth," deputy grand master
workman of the jurisdiction of Califor

a surprise In store last Wednesday night
for the district deputies of this city. He
pent to each of the eight deputies a note
to meet him In the office of the grand
recorder, and after ho had talked with
them in an informal way for a short time
lie invited them to accompany him to.Del
monlco's, where he asked them to a salon,
in which was served an excellent supper.
That, he said, was to show his apprecia
tion of the assistance the deputies bad
rendered him during the year. During the
evening there was an interchange of
ideas as to what changes and reforms
could be suggested at the approaching
session of the Grand Lodge. Several of
the suggestions offered were of a prac
tical character, and if the grand body can
be induced to adopt them they will mate
rially advance the cause of the order in
this State. The gathering of the deputy
grand master and the eight deputies, a
very unusual event, was a very pleasant
one.

COURT ACME'S ANNIVERSARY.
Court Acme No. 61 of -the Foresters of
America, which was instituted March 3,
1891, with a few more than five hundred
members, celebrated its eighth anniver
sary' last Tuesday night by a banquet 'in
the Central dining-rooms, which had been
arranged for by the special committee
consisting of E. P. Donovan (chairman),
R. Renilson, J. F. Johnson, D. E. Shee
han, D. J. Cronin nnd J. H. Wickham.
There were four long tables, at which
wefe seated about two hundred persons,
the majority being ladles, for on occa
sions of this kind the court not having
the pleasure of the attendance of ladies
:;t their meetings wishes to have them
with it at its festivities that they may
learn something of the order and Us
work. An excellent menu was served,
and after the ice cream Grand Treasurer
Frank Conklin, who had been selected to
act as toastmaster. called on Grand Sec
retary Cordy to respond to "The Grand

interesting talk. Joe Tlansen favored

touch at his command that he rarely
failed to hit a high mark. Whole poems
or passages from his verse that floated

precious waifs.
Perhaps the poem entitled "Indirection"
has been the most widely copied, based
STRANGE ICE FREAK AT A NEW YORK FIRE.
DURING the recent severÂ© blizzard In New York a house caught flra, and except for the walls was completely de
stroyed. Despite the weather the fire brigade turned out and poured huge jets of water upon the blazing pile.
The dripping water froze aa it fell, coating the walls with vast Icicles, forming a picturesque and weird decora
tion. The reflection of the fire on the forked tongues of ice was a brilliant spectacle.
During the same cold snap the White Star liner Germanic experienced an extraordinary accident while lying
at the pier In Hudson River. So heavy was the weight of ice on her deck that the water reached her open ports
and she began to sink. Fortunately the depth of water In her moorings was on!y about twelve feet, so that not much
real damage was done beyond the wetting of her coal.
Never before have such interesting sights been witnessed in New York harbor. The harbor was, of course, ice
bound, and only the heavier steamers could force their way through the ice. Those, however, that were powerful
enough to cut out a passageway for themselves came through like Bheeted ghosts, the heavy covering of snow and ice
over the hull giving them an almost supernatural appearance. The ferry boats were unable to land, and in some cases
were lifted up high and dry by the pressure of the ice.
All the inconveniences and miseries of a great frost and snowstorm were experienced. Streets were blocked, the
river communication broken, business interrupted and ships Bunk in the harbor and along the coast. The list of deaths
from starvation, frost or lost in the snow was a long one. The terrible suffering entailed by the blockade of the streets
and the accompanying loss of employment is beyond description. Not less than tjO.OOO people in New York were thrown
upon the mercy of the charitable, and the wealthy citizens went deep into their purses to provide the necessaries of life for
the victims of the inclement weather.
Fnonded to "The Press," M. Jones of
fourt Defiance entertained with a song,
jiftcr which Jacob Label of the American
Forester Iteview responded to "The Com
panions of the Forest." JK el Icy favor-
Id with a pong and then Hugh McCabe,
the "Jolly Boy" of Court Acme, in a hu
nvirons speech, responded to "The La
dies." The last toast, "Our Absent
Brothers. " was responded to in a feeling
manner by D. J. Cronln. The affair was
a very pleasant one and did much to con
tinue the good opinion in which Court
Acme has always been held. It was after
midnight before the gathering broke up.
Previous to the banquet there was an in
formal hop in the social hall of the Al
cazar building, where those who were so
inclined danced for an hour.
KNIGHTS AND LADIES OF HONOR.
Aurora Lodge had a good attendance of
members iast Monday night, and after the
disposal of routine business it was decided
that there shall be some kind of pleasing j
rmertainment after the business of each
meeting. It will be the aim of the com- i
as It is upon the perpetual failure of us
all to put In perfect form the bewitching
dreams that dance before our entranced
vision. The first stanza of It is as fol
lows:
Fair are flowers and the children, but their
subtle suggestion Is fairer;
Rare Is the roseburst of dawn, but tha BeorÂ«t
that clasps It is rarer;
Sweet the exultance of song, but the strain
that precedes it is sweeter;
And never was poem yet writ but the mean
ing mastered the meter."
Briefer, but born of a happy skill. Is the
one titled "A Birthday Lily":
In May the rosebud of the flowering year,
A stainless lily came;
Earth shone with light, and every starry
sphere
Burned with diviner flame.
Art, brooding o'er her large beatttudss,
Felt a creative thrill
Run tingling through her splendid varying
moodp
And consentaneous will.
Song, pralced amid her high lnterpretlnifa.
Knew a seraphic fire
Ache In her bosom, and her startled wings
Shook muslo as a lyre.
And round the awful soul of virglnhood
A whiter glory prayed,
And babes unto their mothers crawled and
cooed,
More softly unafraid.
The mention of Massey and Burns In re
spect to Realf Is made merely to show the
species of poetry Into which his work falls,
the style of spirit which was In him, and
by which he was Inspired. In his phrases
and manner of expression he took, In the
main, his own path. One can say that his
poem of "The Agony" has something' like
the swing of "The Raven," and that when
he wrote:
Some fibers In all hearts hold fast to heavenâ
I could not live without the stars.
he might have caught a note from Alex
ander Smith, as he very likely did the
thought, but not the melody, of the fol
lowing octave:
She kissed me, my beautiful darling,
I drunk the delight of her lips;
The universe melted to ether,
Mortality stood In eclipse.
A spirit of light stood before me,
I heard a far rustle of wings; .
The kings of the earth were as beggars.
And the beggars of earth were as kings."

SO many thousand impressions of
palms have been forwarded to this
department for reading that it has

very much better prosperity. You ar,
very honest in all your dealings. Other
people have taken advantage of your

J. W (inert and J. F. Bright. During 'the
evening W. E. Dorn, Hugh McCauley and
H. D. Keefe were admitted into the camp
by initiation. The camp also received ap
plications from three strangers who
want to join, and from three who wish to
be admitted by card.
After the business of the evening the
degree team from Western Addition
Camp took charge and conferred the de
grees on forty-one candidates who ex
pressed a desire to become initiated into
the mysteries of Orientalism. This de
gree has many beautiful features in it
and when so proficient a team as the one
from Western Addition does the work it
is presented with much dramatic effect
and striking situations. .
Golden Gate Camp then organized an
Oriental team and selected John S. Pat
terson as the grand orient, David Oliver
Jr. as grand scrivinator and a full corps
of assistants. As in this degree what the
grand orient says Is law, he thinks he haÃ

costumes and accessories were correct in
every particular and were features in tha
production of the effective dramatic ef

STAGE
THE critics of London, literary or
dramatic, have been having a
good time in slinging adjectives,
laudatory or otherwise, at the
row volume of Maeterlinck plays
published by Messrs. Duckworth. "Al
ladine and Palomides." "Interior," and
"The Death of Tintagiles," are the new
productions, and here are some extracts
of the reviews: The Daily Mail head
lines its article "The Charm of Maeter
linck," and thus prologizes: "They are
all simple to a surprising degree,
strangely unreal and bald, with the
ir Maeterlinckian baldness, which
â¢is like nothing else in literature. Yet
â¢they are elemental. They go down to
the very bed rook of human nature.
Even the reader initially disposed to be
irreverent leaves them with the convic
-1 on that their author is a new force In
the world, a new seer." We have heard
of the baldness of Wordsworth (I refer
to his poems, of course) which Matthew
Arnold said was like that of the moun
tain tops. The Daily Mail reviewer
continues: " 'Alladine and Palomides'
might be described by many a sane and
reasonable person as frankly idiotic It
has passages of much beauty, but a
lamb that fi<rure s In it emphasizes the
grotesque note, and discomposes the
reader beyond recovery. 'Interior.' on
the other hand, is singularly and un
mistakably beautiful."
The Dally Chronicle sums the plays
up a? "Dramas In Whisper," and says
that Maeterlinck is not only original
hut sincere, thus meeting Goethe's
definition of sincerity. In the Daily
Telegraph Mr. W. L,. Courtney says:
"We have not to deal with real life as
we know it, but with a fantastic scene
full of the imagination of a child. The
curtain rises on old castles, with, won
derful subterranean chambers, winding
staircases, secret passages. endless con
ridors, and, not far away, the. sound of
the restless sea. Sometimes we look
down from a circle of mountains upon
some Old "World dungeon or keept
where the shadows which gather
round the walls are emblematic of
danger or evil, and the air of the val
ley is tainted with miasmatic odors.
If the scenery is thus of that primitive
type which appears in the drawings of
a romantic child, the figures of the
drama are equally remote from exper
ence and life, pale, bloodless phantoms,
hovering between the world we see and
the world of which we dream, pure ab
stractions, whose names are of such
little account that to all intents and
purposes they can get along nameless,
being called 'a king,' or 'a servant,' or
P doctor,' or 'a queen,' or, still more
vaguely, an 'old man,' or 'the
anger.' " â¢ â¢
â¢ â¢ â¢
. : Meanwhile Alfred Sutro, the editor of
the volume, describes the' Maeterlinck
plays as "Dramas of unconsciousness
and instinct." Maeterlinck himself de
scribes them as "Three little dramas
for Marionettes."
Â« â¢ â¢
Here Is an extract from the preface to
the printed edition of Mr. Jones' "Tri
umph of the Philistines." which is Just
published by Macmillan: "Having de
termined to vindicate those who find
a didactic purpose in mv plays, I cast
about me for the most suitable moral
to illustrate. Looking around upon my
countrymen, upon their smug and
banal ideals, their smug and banal
ways of living, their smug and banal
forms of religion, their smug and banal
terror and ignorance of art, their smug
and banal haste to make the best of
both worlds, I concluded that the most
necessary moral to drive home to Eng
lishmen to-day is the wholesome one
contained in a verse of Eccleslaates.
'Be not righteous overmuch: why
ehouldest thou destroy thyself?'* Con
sidering the source of this precept, its
authority will hardly be questioned by
the mass of my countrymen. The neces
sity for its rigid enforcement will be
equally apparent, I hope. In my stren
uous endeavor to point a moral I fear I
flid not take care to write a good play."
The preface also gives one to under-
Ftand that Mr. Jones has not a very
high opinion of the character of the
author of the Psalms. Mr. Jones' pref
aces will serve as valuable material for
bis biographer.

As a front piece to "The Ambassa
dor," the social comedy that is Btill In
success at the St. James Theater, Lon
don, Mrs. Craigie (John Oliver' Hobbs)
has written "A Repentance." The crit
ics are not agreed on the value of this
second dramatic work of Mrs. Craigie's.
It seems to lack the "construction"
that was so much commented on in her
first effort. This Is the story of "A Re
pentance":
In 1835 the Countess dcs Escas, a de
voted adherent of the Carlist cause,
was mourning the death of her hus
band, who had fallen in one of the bat
tles of the civil wars so frequent in
Spain. She kneels, dressed in black,
before the altar in a room in her palace
at Bilbao; apparently this room has
been half converted into a memorial
chapel. Over and around the door of
the husband's room the funeral hang
ings still remain, and the grief of the
Countess is only tempered by the fact
that her husband died in the Carllst
*%Ã¼bÂ«*. We learn the sequence of events
=sÂ» a conversation between the Count
ess dcs Escas and the Marquis of Mon
f>ro, and further that a Christinist at
tack is expected on the citadel. Pres
ently there is a howl of the mob out-
Bide, and we understand that a friar
Is being maltreated by a band of gyp-
Bles and the ardently political riff-raff
of the ancient town of Bilbao. The
Countess sends out her servants and
gives the friar shelter; afu-r a very few
words it is clear that the man is a
ppy, and the Marquis de Monfero prom
ises to come in with a picket of men to
watch in case he proves troublesome.
The spy. "vous le devinez " as M. Sar
cey says, is the Count dcs Escas, who
had never been killed at all. After a
long ecene the Count reveals himself.

As soon as the Countess discovers hÂ«r
husband she runs and puils down the
funereal curtains from ' the bridal
chamber, but her joy Is somewhat
marred when she learns that her hus
band has gone over to the other side.
Bhe opposes religious faith to her hus
band's opportunism, but they do not
thrash the subject out, for the Marquis
returns with his men. The Countess

says, has escaped through the window.
The Carlist leader demurs, but finally
consents to be sent away; then Dcs
Escas appears at the door of the room
dressed^ in his uniform. He has given
his promise to his wife, and when the
I'hristlnists enter he refuses to follow
them, and is shot dead before his
wife's eyes.

Lots of persons used to write letters
to the dramatic critic of The Call, won
dering why he reckoned Miss Blanche
Bates among the big actresses of Amer
ica. Perhaps they, as well as her
admirers here â and she has them
by the thousand â will he pleased
to know that in the short time she has
attained to unquestioned position and
no little fame. Her latest success is in
the James O'Neil production of "The
Musketeers" at the Broadway Theater.
She impersonates Milady, and from all
accounts the honors seem to be all
hers, William Winter, reviewing the
adaptation and the playing, has this to
say in the Tribune:
"The triumph of Miss Blanche Bates,
in this harrowing and most exacting
situation, should be recorded as one of
genuine and remarkable power. Amid
all the extravagance of the theatrical
scheme â tlv plotting Cardinal, the
eavesdropping, the secret panel, the talk
of an imperiled Queen, an infatuated
noble, the state's welfare, and the re
wards of falsehood, and all the stuff
and nonsense of a wild and whirling
nove l_she made her auditors forget the
theater, and yield themselves com
pletely to the charm of a bad woman,
superb in her beauty, and, sirenlike,
luring honor to destruction with the in
fernal witchery of sensual love. As to

The Bostonlans, with "Rob Roy" as the
bill, have played to a succession of
crowded housff at the Columbia Theater
in the face of the opposition of the grand
opera season. This ever-welcome organ-
ization emphasizes each year the warm
regard In which it is held in the esteem
of music-lovers. Individual opinions may
differ as to the merits and demerits of
the personnel of the present group of
singers, but the fact rr mains that the en
semble is strong and the performances are
quite up to the high standard set by this
company. From a histrionic standpoint
the work of the organization is good, and
the appearance of Helen Bertram as
prima donna soprano is most welcome,
for her spirited acting is far superior to
that of any of her predecessors.
In "Kob Roy" the Bostonlans have
'tgain scored most heavily, and the de
mand for seats for the lfint performances
to btv given next week is as heavy as it
was previous to the opening performance
of the new work. Like its companion pic
ture of English outlawry, "Robin Hood,"
"Rob Roy" presents a series of more or
less historic Incidents through which is
threaded a legitimate comic element.
Pictorially "Rob Roy" is especially
attractive with its masses or Eng
lish scarlet and Scottish plaids, while
the spirited finales and ensembles
are potent to stir the blood. In.
dividual hits have been scored by Mr.
Barnabee as the provost, and his fun
making is admirably reinforced by those
capable actors, George Frothingham and
Harry Browa. The -principal musical 1

A hit has been scored by the Alcazar
company In the Paulton farce, "Nerves,"
which is doing so well that it will be con
tinued another week. "A Bit of Scan
dal," which was to have gone on to-mor
row night, will be held back for a week.
The story of "Nerves," which was told
in an earlier issue, is very amusing. The
retribution that comes to thos<? petuiant
persons who credit all their bad nature to
their "nerves" is humorously managed,
and the company gives a lively perform
ance. Some nf the settings are striking,
especially the one of a confectionery

were seen hereabout three years ago. They
are credited with having a much strong
er act now than when first here. Manning

G.lds ir\ Warm Glima es.
Colds and allied diseases are so easily
induced in a hot climate, which keeps the
pores of the skin constantly open, that
few people escape being afflicted for
many weeks at a time by some form of
these distressing attacks; and once hay- â 
ing contracted cold in the head, sore
throat, or Inflamed lungs, it is difficult
to assuage the trouble. The hot moist
air in sunshine changing to a subtle chilli
ness under a heavy shower, or to positive
dankness during the clear nights, con
stantly- adds to the inflammation of the
! membranes, unless the utmost caution ia
exercised.
A susceptible person or a -victim to colds
must take prompt, measures to alleviate
the simple trouble, or it may be followed
by pneumonia, or by the far worse and
more insidious disease consumption.
â¢Woolen abdominal bandages are advo
cated as a means of reducing the danger
of rapid changes, in the surface tempera
sure of the body, and are undoubtedly
worthy of consideration. The writer,
however, prefers to dress with a fair de
gree of warmth, generally wearing thin
cotton underclothes, protected by light
woolen ove-rclothes.
While in this way one may become
overheated, the cooling-off process is not
nearly so dangerous with a complete cov
ering of non-conducting woolen mate
rials as it is with the thin cotton and
linen clothes affected by the native popu
lation. It is a good plan always to put
on hoarier clothes at night. If you feel
the slightest chilliness, exercise, or put
on a light overcoat. By following these
suggestions the grave afflictions of local,
congestion may be largely prevented.â

everything from the quays has been cleared.
Business In salmon has shown very little re

within the last week have been mainly stored.
Holders are firm, with the conviction that later

present high prices seem to have reduced the
consumption. The supply of half-pound tins
has been limited, but one vessel With a lair

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. March Stocks were very
strong to-day and with the transactions of over
half a million shares In the two hours' session
material gains were quite general and quota
tions closed at about the best. Expectation that
the bank statement would be favorable was an
early incentive, for purchases, and when it
appeared, although showing an increase of
about $5, 500.0U0 in the discount, the decrease of
only $500,000 In the surplus reserve received a
favorable Interpretation and most stocks con
tinued their progress upward. The firmness for-
American securities in London in anticipation
of the fortnightly settlement, the reappearance
of large factors in the market, less apprehen
sion as to the monetary situation and the
nearness of the close of certain State Legis
latures were all assigned as reasons for confi
dence In market operations. The announcement
of the .formal transfer of the Brooklyn Union
Elevated to the Brooklyn Rapid Transit.Com
pany's stock was made, and rose 4% points on
large dealings.
There was a Jump of 4 points In Long Island
Railroad, which is understood to have a work-
Ing arrangement of the Brooklyn Rapid. Tran
sit. There were sympathetic advances with
Transit In other local transportation shares,
Metropolitan figuring for 3%, Third Avenue 4
and Manhattan a fraction. Among the Indus
trials Continental Tobacco preferred got up 2%,
Gas 1 ' and Consolidated Gas X Among the
Yanderbllte there were advances of 1% in New
York Central and lc for Canadian Central.
Strength was also displayed by Atchlson pre
ferred. Southern Railway preferred and St.
Loula and San Francisco. Although most loans
â were made on Friday to carry over until Mon
day the fact that call rates ruled to-day at 4
per cent was favorably commented upon and
the market cloned strong. About seven-tenths
of the stock dealt In on the Exchange advanced
this week. The dealings, which were about
half a million larger than the week previous,
were mostly influenced by the monetary situa
tion and the Interest attached to the bank
statement was largely as to whether it fore
casted easier or tighter money. Judging from
the course of prices after the bank statement's
appearance speculators seemed to Incline to the
view that for the present call money would
not get above this week's figures. The highest
rate for call money accommodations, 9 per cent,
was reached on Monday. Subsequently the
rale gradually Cased off and closed at 4 per
cent, only slightly above the lowest figure.
Notwithstanding the high rates for call money
prevailing through the week exchange ruled

likely.

over nearly the whole week. Sugar was second \
In activity, nearly half a million shares being ,
dealt in, the 'bulk of which was in the early
part of the week, v 200,000 changing hands on
Monday at the highest quotation in the stock's
history: IS2 was reached. The stock fluctuated
wildly down and up, 154 being the lowest, and
closing with a net locs of 11 points.

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK. March 25.â The Financier says:
The changes In the totals of the New York
bank statement for the current week are
nif-aningless. Judged in the ordinary sense, for
the reason that the totals Include the Astor
National, a new clearing member, and the
Hudson River and Astor Place banks, which,
as branches of the Corn Exchange Bank, are
now cleared through the parent institution.
The new banks carry average deposits of ab-mt
$*.333.000 and loans of over $7,500,000 and the
statement must have been affected by an
amount nearly as large, although the Corn
Exchange totals do not indicate the full change.
Of course, the new banks carry a full reserve,
so that the position of the remaining banks
was nut materially altered, but to get at the
real operations of the clearing house instlui
M',:is It is necessary to deduct at least $6,000,000
both In loans and deposits. On this basis, the
expansion of $5,530,000 In loans, as compared
with the previous week, means that there has
been a slight decrease in the actual discounts
uf the banks whose totals have been hereto
fore reported. The same result holds good In
deposits, for the increase of $3,339,000 does not
equal the addUion of the Astor National's to
tal of $4, 000,000. to say nothing of the deposits
of the other two banks added.
It will be seen, therefore, that the deposit
liabilities of the regular clearing house banks |
were materially reduced last week, as were the
loans. Reserves ought to have shown a cor
responding gain, but the Increase in cash was I
only a third of a million, and as the deposit I
expansion called for about $850, (HX) additional |
requirement, the actual decrease In reserves
w.is $516,750. Perhaps a more accurate way to
get at the position of the banks Is to say thut
thirteen of the sixty-three banks are now be
low the 25 per cent reserve rule, as against
twenty-five for the previous week. A state- I
ment. with factors described eliminated, shows j
that the position of the banks has been rather j
strengthened. The routine operations with the
treasury for the week resulted In a loss of
something like $1,500,000 to the banks, but the
pain from the Interior served In large part to
offset this. The totals have been Influenced
somewhat by the payments made In completing
a large industrial deal.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 25.â The feverish excitement
which ruled In wheat at the close yesterday was
Again iJJ evidence to-day, but ftt the start U>Â«
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 26, 1809.
bulls seemed to waver. Instead of a general
demand for May at 70% c, such as at the close
Friday, there were plenty of sellers at from
6<Â» T down to 68% C. Before the bulls could get
a word In edgewise the price slid off to 69% c.
The bulls soon found their voices, however.
When the bulls got through with the last bar of
the opening chorus May wheat was up to 70% c.
Much milder weather and a spread of \yet snow
for a larze section of the winter wheat area
was the chief cause of the llrst decline. Re
ports of damage in the Southwest received con
firmation from numerous sources and In many
Instances the extent of injury was reported
sensationally heavy. A London cablegram re
ported this season's Indian wheat crop 7% per
cent smaller than that of last year. Another
cold spell was announced to be elbowing Its
way down from the Northwest. As soon as the
Weather Bureau notice was issued the shouting
for wheat became almost hysterical. The price
of May rose Irregularly to the accompaniment
of heavy trading until 72% c was reached. That
was l%c over yesterday's closing prices. It re
: acted to 70% c and closed at 70%@70%c.
Although Influenced largely by wheat, corn
i embraced a good many Independent features.
i May corn closed He higher.
i The excitement In wheat had little effect In
' oats. May oats closed unchanged.
Provisions showed slight weakness at the
start, but gradually Hrmed up on buying by
commission houses for outside account. May

CLARIBEL'S JOURNEY
INTO PICTURE LAND
IT ALL happened on her birthday.
Claribel sat on a green, sunny
knoll. Bhe wasn't doing anything
in particular, just enjoying the
sunshine. After a while Claribel
grew drowsy, and was Just thinking
about taking a nap. when some one
spoke her name close to her.
Claribel was wide awake in an ln-
Btant. Right beside her stood a little
birthday card. He had a head, feet
and hands, to be sure, but otherwise
you would have surely thought he was
one of the pretty cards you buy for
your best chums.
The man was about eight inches tall
and he had a merry, happy look In his
face, as though he expected to have a
good time.
"Claribel," he said again. "Yes. sir."
she answered at last.
"Would you like to go home with
me?" he asked.
"Oh, my!" she exclaimed. "I would
like It so much."
"Well, come, then; we will start, as It
is getting late."
The little man clapped his hands and
& little buggy appeared. It was dec
orated w, flowers, laces, rib
bons, etc., mad was drawn by six black

They both got in the buggy and
Clarib<-i was surprised to see that she
was as small as the little man and as
light as thistle-down.
The buggy skimmed over the fields
and soon stopped at a solitary oak tree.
Then Clal-ibel and the little, man
jumped out and he produced a small
key. from his pocket and applied It to
hat looked like a tiny knot hole in
the tree. What was Clarity's surprise
â when she found this to be the lock of
a tiny door.
They passed into a lons narrow path
that was softly lighted by beautiful
lamps.
After a short walk, without meetine
any one, they turned a corner and
what a picture met their sight.
Before t-h>-m stood a grand fairy pal
ace of what seemed to be gold anu
us stones, hut ap they drew in-nr
er Claribel thought it looked like beau
tiful paptT.
In front of the palace, Instead of a
real garden, violets, forget-me-nots,
roses, pansles and all sorts of flowers
were painted on paper, and the grass on
green paper. ; Everything looked as
natural as life, but even the trees were
paper.
Inside they heard the sound of music
and laughter, and Claribel and the man
went into the wide hall.
Then they climbed a lovely winding
staircase, and were immediately shown
Into a room where the company had
assembled.
On a platform at one end of the
ror.m sat the King and Queen- of Pic
tureland. Th*Â»y sat In beautiful oaner
chairs and ha-1 paper crowns on their
heads, but the paper looked like cold.
All of the people were eleerantlv
dr^asf-d in lace paper, beautiful flowers
scattered on this, and verses and
hearts at whirh tiny Cupids aimed their
Arrows. The King's and the Queen's
coFtumps were the nicest of. all.
Claribel was cordially welcomed by
the King and Queen, who invited her
to sit flown near them. Soon a bell

sat at one end of the long table, and
Claribel and her valentine man at the
other.
It would be hard to tell all they had
that night to eat. Everything was
made of paper â oranges, nuts, candy,
oake and Ice cream â but Claribel
thought that they tasted better than
anything she had ever eaten.
When nearly everything had been
eaten, the King and the Queen and all
the people arose and went back to the
other room.
Claribel noticed that all of the ser-.
vants were comic valentines, and that
none of these were among the guests.
So you see that they are considered
low In the Picture Kingdom.
After awhile the music recommenced
and every erne began dancing. Clari
bel's little man asked her to dance, so
Bhe danced with him and others until
she was tired.
Her partner told Claribel that she
had better go home or her mother
would be anxious. So they said "Good
by" to all the picture people and went
out through the garden and to the
door in the tree. Before they went out
the little man told Claribel that people
often found them in the fields, cut off
their heads, arms and feet and sold
th^m for birthday cards. Then Clari
bel was very sorry.
Th< y then went out of the tree Into
the eotrf air. The beetle team was wait

minutes they were back on the knoll
''laribel had been.
The little man paid, "Now I must go,
Claribel, but if I am alive I will come
next year, so you can be here
then."
"All right," she answered. "Good-
by."
"Good-by," and he Jumped into the
buggy and was whisked out of sight.
ribel half thought she would fol
low him, but Just then hpr mother
called "Claribel, where are you?"
"Here, mamma," she answered,
springing up and rubbing her eyes. The
sun was just setting and she hurried
to the house.
Claribel told her mother all about her
strange visit, but her mother only
laughed and said, "You must have had
a good sleep."
That evening when her father came
home he called Claribel and said, "Look
what I got at the postofflce for you,
dear."
It was a birthday card. As Claribel
drew it out of the envelope she aimost
screamed, for there was her. little man,
without head, hands or feet. She re
membered the verse and the flowers
(forget-me-nots) and the colorsâ pink
and blue.
Some one must have caught the little
man when he was going home.
Claribel felt very sad about it, and
that night She told the birthday card
F he would take good care of him al
ways: so she kept him in a pretty glass
case on her bureau, and often she would
go and talk to him.
Her mother laughed and said she was

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 26, 1899.
THE DONKEY
THAT BRAYED
HARRY had been at school about
a week when Sam Slickens, who
lat next him, offered to sell him
his donkey for only a dollar.
Harry thought this was too good
a chance to be missed, so said he would
buy it with the money he was savins
for Christmas and then surprise the
family.
On Saturday Sam brought the don
key and tied him to a tree in the stable
yard. As he was going off with his
dollar Harry asked him the donkey's
name.
"We call him Donk for short," an
swered Bam.
"I think I'll rail him Prince when I
know him better," said Harry.
"Perhaps you'll call him Bray when
you know him better." With this Sam
darted off whistling for Joy.
Wondering over this, Harry ran to
call out the family. They came, and
were more than surprised. His father
took one good look, shook his head
gravely, and with never a word went
back to the house. His mother feared
the creature was too frisky. His elder
brother, Edgar, wanted to know how
much he had been paid to take him.
But Harry kept cheerful, for he was
sure they would find out this was a
pretty good donkey in spite of his name.
At 3 o'clock the next morning: the
donkey .burst into a bray that aroused
the whole neighborhood, and went on
as if he did not know how- to stop. But
at last he did.
"Harry, what kind of a beast is that
you have brought in the family?" called
his father fro-m the next room.
"I don't know," mourned Harry. "I

The man was so pleased at Dora's
Jittle speech that he said, "Yes."
All the people came to buy from Dora.
By the time the fair was over she had
$1 55. When she reached home her
mamma was much pleased, and gave
her enough to buy her a doll. Dora was
pleased, and thought her mamma very
kind. So the little girl got the doll and
her mamma got a new dress.
FUZZLE CUESSERS.
A WORD with our young corre
spondents. So many letters con
talning answers to puzzles have
been received that there would
not be room for them all in
forty pages. This is to express thanks
for .the Interest shown by you all. Irwin
Bare had bad luck when his puzzle was
published â because of a misprint. Jon
appeared as Jou, and that took the
name of Jones from the list of twenty.
Did that discourage Cecil Heans of
Berkeley? Not at all! Sh<> made the
twelfth name "Allen," and so counted
out twenty. With the name of Jones
added she had twenty-one names, and
so is the champion up to date.
E. Gladys Coffin wrote from Dutch
Flat In reference to the four animals
guess he must have the stomach-ache.
He ate an awful pile of hay."
Here Edgar was heard laughing and
chuckling in his room. So Harry felt
like making for him.
Exactly at 3 o'clock the following
morning Donk took to braying again.
It was "uch-aw, uch-aw, uch-aw," un
til he Beemed to choke. Every one but
Harry hoped he was dead. But he was
not.
After school that day Harry went to
play with Fred Barton, who lived at
the corner. But very soon they got on
the fence to watch the tennis players
in the court that spread from Fred's
yard to the next street.
"WTiy, there goes Donk!" all at once
cried Harry- "He has broken away!"
And Donk it was, hurrying along,
flinging out his heels for gladness.
When he came to the corner he turned
and then slowed down, with his eyes
fixed on a horse and cart tied to a tree
on the grassy space to the right of the
court. A little child named Alfred sat
in the cart watching. the game. The
horse was old and sleepy-looking.
As Harry tells it, Donk stopped to
think a moment and then crept on tip
toe through the gate and up to the
horse. Mrs. Barton says it is true, as
she saw it from her window. She also
says Donk actually put his mouth to
the horse's ear before he struck off in
the worst bray of all. Then, as the
poor horse turned to dash away, Donk
flung himself proudly toward the gate.
The tennis players caught the horse
just after little Alfred had fallen across
the axle. He was picked out, badly
scared, and afterward told his mother
he was dragged two miles before the
horse was stopped.
That night Harry's father gave the
donkey to some gardeners who lived
away off near th>' marsh, and who said
they did not mind brays.

and one tree. Not to be balked by dif
ficulties she found that the links of
sausages (grround hag) represented a
lynx. The grizzly old man (grizzly)
she met brnvely and decided that he
represented a hnre! A natural guess In
each case. Both guesses were clever.
The answers to the San Francfsco
street puzzles of last week are as fol
lows: (1) Jackson, (2) Taylor, (3)
Pierce, (4) Steuart, (5) Post, (6) Chest
nut, (7) Geary. To-day the puzzle
pictures represent birds common to all
the Pacific Coast States and Territories.
Here are some of the young guessers
who answered all the street puzzles
without a mistake: Gertrude Donohue,

Perry street; Milton S. Silverstone, 112
Lyon street; Ernest Ryder, 1627 Hayes
street; Floyd Walker, 1631 Hayes
street. James S. Greer, 4120 Twenty
fourth street, ingeniously flg-ured out
Ppear street for Pierce. The truth Is
that one answer would fit as well as the
other, nnd James will make Bronstrup
think hardâ that his puzzles may be
solved only in one way. Bdna Ralph
of Alvarado must be counted among
those who guessed right.

PAPA'S SHARE
OF THE CANDY
THERE was a bag of candy in the
house and "Little Mister," aged
three years, found it. There was
too much of sweets for him to
Bafely eat and so he was coaxed
to divide his treasures â his by right of
dlacovery â with three larger children.
Then there was too much for "'Little
Mister's" share for his health and he
was coaxed to "save the biggest piece
for papa."
After awhile "Little Mister" had
eaten his candy all up. Down "red
lane" it had pleasantly traveled and
his face plainly said "more, please."
But there was no more â only papa's
share. "Little Mister" was on honor.
He had the share of papa in his keep
ing. Presently he began to creep be
hind a chair. When he came out there
was something in his mouth:
Several pairs of eyes looked at "Littla
Mister." He alone spoke:
"Desg too much canny; make poor
papa sick," he said, holding the candy,
which he had rolled up after nibbling
it behind his back in both chubby little
hands.
"And so you thought you would eat
a little to keep papa from being sick?"
"Dcs, mamma."
The smiles that met this sort of rea
soning seemed to please "Little Mis
ter," who, after a time, was again miss
ing. He wasn't behind the big chair,
nor hiding under the piano, nor was
he playing "choo-choo train" with a
rusty locomotive three Inches long in
the hall.
"Little boy!"
No answer.
"Little boy!"
Again no answer.
"Mamma has lost her little boy. If
she should hear a little squeak Bhe
might find him."
Was there ever a child who could
give up a chance to play hide-and-go
seek? If so "Little Mister" was not
that one. From a distant corner of the
room, where he was hiding in a jungle,
back of the sofa, came out a faint
"queek."
Queek! And now the hunt for this
untamed little burrower was on. As the
hunter follows the sound of his game
so mamma hunted down "Little Mis
ter," and drew him forth, kicking and.
struggling, but bubbling over with
laugh, by one tiny little black shoe.
"Where's the candy, little Mister?"
"Let's pa (play) hide some more,
mamma!"
"Tea, but where is the candy? Have
you losv it?"
"No, mamma."
"Whf-re is it?"
Little Mister lies flat on his stomach
upon the floor and once more works his
way into the Jungle, where he remains
some time, v hHe the specta:>-s wait
patiently. When he comes our he liol.lb
in one hand the "very tiniest little bit of
c:in<'> .
""What have you in your hand, Little
Mister?"
"Papa's canny."
"Does it taste good?"
"Dcs, mamma."
"What are you going to do with that
little piece?"
"Papa don't like dis kind canny,
mamma. No!" (Expression of great
disgust on the little face at the idea of
eating that kind of candy.)
'What will papa say when he comes
home?"
"He say tank 00, darling child."
Did the double phare of candy make
up for the medicine that followed it
"down red lane?" Little Mister had it
all.

Pierce, which is another pointer. Spear
must count as correct, and so Claudie

other answers are all right. Claudie is
one of the youngest puzzlers, aged only
10. A. Partington, 1721 Eddy street,

UNCLE BEN'S STORY
OF FUN IN SCHOOL
I WILL, never forget," said Uncle
Ben, "one funny half hour when I
was a school boy. The principal was
fond of music and fond of showing
off his pupils. At the end of the
term he'd have all the children gather
in one big room and sing and speak
pieces, and then he would give out
prizes. All the people i n the district
came. My sister Rose was a fine organ
player. She was there this day and she
had a fine organ piecn to play and sing.
It was -Behold the Flower.'
"Before school opened Ned Cart
wright and I were at work in the exhi
bition room .tacking up wreaths and
streamers of red, white and blue. I
noticed that Ned chuckled several times
while we were at work, but I did not
think much about it. I was only
anxious for the exercises to begin, for
I was proud of sister Rose's music.
"Every one was there when school
took in. The principal, proud as a
peacock, had on his best clothes and
his exhibition day smile and manners
and his shoes were as shiny as looking
glasses. Every one coughed and said
'hem,' and the principal rang a bell and
we all came marching in, two by two,
to take our placos. I had a place near
the organ. In fact, I had to pump the
bellows to kfpp the pipes full of wind.
" 'We will begin the exercises,' said
the principal gaily, 'with the song "Be
hold the Flower," by Miss Rnse, who
will accompany the song with music on
the pipp organ.'
"There was some applause as Rose
took her seat. T slid anmnd back of the
organ and . gently pumped the oreran
bellows full. Rose played a few chords
and then began to sing 'Behold th<>
Flower. 1
"Suddenly I heard some one snicker.
Then there was a titter, and another
and another, and then some one
laughed. Directly all the visitors were
laughing the hardest possible. I dropped
the organ bellows handle, for Rose had
stopped playing and singing and was

THE
HARPER
Like a drift of faded blossoms
Caught in a slanting rain,
His fingers glimpsed down the strings
of his harp
In a tremulous refrain.
Patter and tinkle, and drip, and drip!
Ah ! but the clwrds were rainy sweet!
And I closed my eyes and I bit my lip,
' As he played there in the street.
Patter, and drip, and tinkle !
And there was the little bed
In the corner of the garret,
And the rafters overhead I
And there was the, little window â
Tinkle, and drip, and drip I

And God's companionship.

"No marvel. Her new blue silk drees

and her face was plastered with white.
What did It all mean? I ran to Rose
and aaked her If she was hurt. The
people were still laughing and the prin
cipal was raging like a lion.

shouted. 'Ben, you were here before
Bchool â did you do it?'
" 'No, sir.'
" 'Who was here with you?'
"I now knew what Ned Cartwright
had been chuckling about. 'Behold the
Flower! 'âso read the programme. Be
hold! Flour had been put in the organ
tubes by Ned, and when I pumped the
wind into the organ the flour all blew
out. The school district committee who
sat in the front row were all white. I
looked at them and then joined every
one there, excepting sister Rose and the
district committeeâ they all looked
solemn enough â in a good laugh, bo I
could not answer the principal.
"Ned was not such a bad boy â only
full of mischief. He and sister Rose
had joked each other, and he had fig
ured it out that it would be a great
joke to flour the organ.
"'I did it, teacher,' he now said,
standing up in his place. 'Ben was
here, but he did not know anything
about it. I did it for a joke and did not
know that the joke would turn out so
badly.'
â " 'Very well.' said the principal, while
a lnok of anger darkened his smile, 'we
will further test your ability to enjoy a
practical joke after the exhibition.
Take your seat, Edward.'

month and earned additional money as |
a correspondent for San Francisco and
New York newspapers.
In Spain I gained admittance to the J
archives under the pretext that I was
hunting up newspaper stories. During
many months I searched these archives |
and pondered over the thing. I found !
that the Peralta family was extinct !
and that the Peraltas in Arizona and
Mexico were descendants of the ser
vants of the family who had taken th*
name of the house.
One day as I was making the rounds
of the curio shops I came across two
ivory portraits of great excellence, evi
dently a husband and wife of Spanish
nobility belo-nging to the period closing
the eighteenth century. I purchased
these pictures and they were the found
ation upon which 1 built the mythical
superstructure that all but stood
against the efforts of the Government
and the great expenditures of money
to tear It down.
I told my wife â for after coming to
Spain I had legally married this Span
ish beauty, having lived until then un
der a secret marriage agreement â that
these portraits were of her great-grand
parents.
Now the reader must understand that
my investigations had proven that no
grant existed, and that there had been
a noble family in Spain named Peralta
that was now extinct. Therefore, with
these two pictures I pushed aside the
mass of forgeries that I had accumu
lated around "the Willing title."
ignored all the past theories and start
ed out entirely anew.
First I traced the history of the
Peralta family and found that the
name originated in a title Pera (a pear)
alta (high), Peralta signifying a high
pear. The family originated in con
ferring a dukedom upon one Enrique
Carrillo.

Then I selected another defunct
family named Silva and made my hero
the issue of these families and called
him Silva de Peralta.
I made the records show that in the
winter of '61 and '62 the second baron
was compelled to abandon Sonora on
account of the French invasion, and
thereupon set out for Spain via Los
Angeles and San Francisco. In the
meantimeâ May 1, 1822â he had mar
ried and to him was born a daughter
who married Don Jose Ramon Carmen
Maso y Castillo September 20, 1858.
With this daughter and her husband
he set out upon his journey. They
were delayed at the crossing of the
Santa Ana River near San Bernardino,
Cal., by the excessive floods of that
season, where there was born of the
daughter a pair of twins, a girl and
boy. The latter and mother dying,
were buried in one coffin at San Sal
vador. The father proceeded en route
to San Francisco. This child surviv
ing was christened Sofia L,oreto Mi
caila Maso y Silva de Peralta.
Such was the mythical lineage I built
for my Spanish bride. You may won
der how I was able to prove all these
details that happened in this genera
tion. I will tell you how. I had visited
towns in California in which I laid the
early history of my wife. I talked with
old settlers and found that there had
been these incidents in the past and
then I built the story of my wife to
conform with what I had been told. An
old rancher would tell me about a
stranger who had gone through that
part of the country in a certain year
and about his wife dying. I would try
and fit my story to this circumstance
and if I succeeded I had a witness who
would go on the stand and swear to the
facts.
Then, too, It was not so difficult to
change ancient records. All that was
Hales.
necessary was to add a son or daughter
to families whose last descendant had
died several generations prior to the
time I did my work, then marry this
son and daughter and I had connected
the families and started the lineage.
All my work was characterized by
absolute simplicity. In every town in
Mexico and Spain are public scribes to
whom you may go and they will copy
or write anything you ask. By going to
different scribes and using caution none
of them suspected the purpose to which
I put their writings. Indeed, they do so
much copying that any particular piece
of work soon slips from their mind.
Then it was easy to slip out pages and
insert papers in the records of the
archives because I Was given the great
est liberty in my work. Patience was
required in the task and I possessed
that quality In abundance.
Recurring to the work in Spain, I
recall that I had stuffed the archives
there in two cities, Madrid and Se
ville, before I sought any copies; in
other words, I always did my work in
that line before I began an investiga
tion, depending upon the investigation
to develop the work that I had depos
ited in the archives, and for this rea
son it took me a great while to do a
very little. I found no inconvenience
in any of this work from the simplicity
with which the officials received me,
as I was always on the outlook for
curiosities to mention in my corre
spondence.
After completing my work in Mexico
I took a rest of some three weeks to
allow the matter to season, and then I
made formal application for a search.
The custodian found this portion of
the archives fairly glued together with
age, so was completely "off his feet,"
certifying with zeal to all this find,
which went forward to startle the
world and set at naught all criticism
ingomuch that my supporters declared
that the Government would be com
pelled to confirm the grant in the Su
preme Court regardless of what the
lower court should, would or could do.
Thus "not a farthing for corruption"
was the motto.
During all this time I never had an
accomplice. I did my work absolutely
alone; therefore there could not possi
bly have existed ground for a charge
of conspiracy to defraud the Govern
ment and all the evidence introduced
by the Government to that end for the
purpose of conviction was false and
vicious. When I started in I could not
speak or write Spanish. I hired public
scribes in Mexico and Spain to do my
copying. During the latter part of our
visit in Spajn my wife and myself were
received in noble families and were en
tertained lavishly. The public Is fa
miliar with my trial and how the great
est men of this country pleaded my
case.
To estimate the expenditures on
either side of this case would lead into
differential calculus. It has been said
that I expended a quarter of a million
dollars, yet the half would strike nearer
the mark, and I would not make a
guess for the Government, understand
ing as I do the various avenues for
Klondiking Uncle Sam in such matters.
The Assistant District Attorney in his
review before the jury at the trial upon
a charge of conspiracy to defraud the
Government, a simple misdemeanor,
stated that the Government had ex
pended $45,000 to convict me and he
hoped the jury would consider that part
and not disagree. Yet this trial did not
cost me one nickel, and the good reason
was. I had it not.
The Government said: "We consider
this one of the greatest schemes to rer
petratt a fraud on the Government that
was ever attempted in this cc.-untry, or
possibly in any other. It has been car
ried on successfully for over a quarter
of a. century, and a large amount of
money obtained, based upon its sup
posed and really prima facie genuine
ness, and for a quarter of a century,

every year continuously, as we will be i
able to show to the court, there has j
! been a persistent, intelligent and ag- .
grtssive effort to manufacture their
claim from top to bottom. â¢ â¢ â¢ 1
will say frankly to the court that this j
case, as it stood, unchallenged by the ;
Government, wo-uld have required this
court to confirm to the original grantee, |
for the benefit, really of the present
claimants. â¢ â¢ * They have presented
their claim based on properly authen
ticated documents, which, as translated
into English and before being analyzed,
make as clean and complete a case of j
a grant as we have ever had before this i
court. It seemed to us that it was j
strange that there should come from
Spain and Mexico so many documents
of the greatest dignity, certified by the
keepers of the archives, fortified again
by the certificates of our own officials,
making them thereby prima facie evi
dence in this court."
Collis P. Huntington said: "While I j
have not entered into the details of tht
title, 1 have not had time, but my old
I friend, Charles Crocker, who examined
into it thoroughly, believed in it, and
I shall do all I can to aid you."
Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll said: "I
have not examined into the matter is
carefully as Frank Hurd has. but I am
satisfied that your wife is entitled to
! that propertyâ she is a charming woman
and deserves to succeed. Come to my
office and make your headquarters, you
are more than welcome." And at an
other time he said: "Yes, if it will be
of any advantage to you, elect me presi
dent of your company."
Roscoe Conkling said: "If this title
stood for a tract of land here in New
York I would consider it unimpeach
able; as it is there is so much politics
in the matter that I cannot say just
what will be the outcome, yet I find a
perfect title in this woman, Mrs.
Reavis."
John W. Mackay said> "I consider
that Mrs. Reavis has as good title to
that immense property as I have to
this hat I hold in my hand, and I paid
my own money for it."
Charles Crocker said: "While I have
always had absolute confidence in your
wife's title to the grant, I think you
will succeed better without our active
support than with it, since our sins
would be weighty for you to bear."
To which I involuntarily responded,
my wife and niece being present: "I
would gladly be billed for heaven in
a hand-basket laden with your sins,"
such was my admiration for that great
son of toil. He was an indefatigable
worker to the last and without ques
tion he was not only the first, but
most important of all my supporters;
and he left the title question to his
attorneys, thereby bringing the entire
syndicate of attorneys and politicians
of the Huntington syndicate into the
scheme through a liberal distribution
! of shares- of stock in the Casa Grande
Improvement Company, which was or
ganized for the purpose of furthering
the schemes in view, the least of which
was the confirmation of the Peralta
grant with its estimated value of $100.
--000,000, the ultimate object of the syn- j
dicate being the irrigation of 15,000,000
acres of land.
I shall close with the exact words
with which I closed the case before the
court of private claims â throwing my
eyeglasses upon the table 'between my- j
self and the court I said: "I would not I
give the value of these glasses to win j
that immense estate and be compelled
to assume the responsibilities involved
