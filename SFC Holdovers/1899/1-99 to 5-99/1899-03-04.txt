LONG'S BITTER
DENUNCIATION
OF CONGRESS
Says It Has Outraged Com
mon Sense and Public
Sentiment.

. His Department Must Discharge
Three 1 honsand Sailors in
Perfect Training.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 3.â The fail
ure of Congress to provide liberally for
the army and navy was the subject of
serious discussion at to-day's Cabinet
meeting. Secretary Long was caustic
ln his comments on the parsimony of
Congress. It is understood that in con
versation â with the President, and fel
low Cabinet members, this morning, he
expressed his views in substance as
follows:
He expected that Congress would re
flect the popular sentiment and insure
the future peace and honor of the
country by most liberal treatment of
the navy and army. This seemed more
reasonable because of the example of
Spanish folly. The navy of that coun
try was fraudulent, and its army was
â¢in a wretched state, because of the
failure of the Government to provide
for the most pressing needs.
In the face of this the dying Con
gress outrages common sense and pop
ular sentiment by a deliberate crippling
of the navy at a time when foreign
attention is directed to our experiment
in colonial government The projected
new warships are delayed and the es
timates for current expenses of the
'.navy. are reduced so that it is neces
sary to weaken our squadrons and dis
charge some 3000 sailors, who are at
this moment perfectly trained and who
cannot be easily replaced should an
emergency arise.
The richest country on earth, re
sponsible for the introduction of civil
ization in the Philippines, for the es
tablishment of a stable government in
Cuba and the Americanization of Porto
Rico, we need a navy second only to
that of Great Britain, for which we
have a superb foundation. At this time

should be an example to Congress. They
have placed their armies under the
newest and best system, from which
politics .is excluded. Yet we, who are
better able than any other to make
ourselves secure a gainst assault by
making the army nd the navy pow
erful, can find no better example than
that of Spain.
There is a natural jealousy and fear
of the American republic among the
European powers because of its wealth,
industrial rivalry, population and gen
eral strength. The demonstration of its
extraordinary naval efficiency,, in the
Spanish war and th . high character
of its soldiers made a deep impression
on European observer and did more to
place thit among the nations of the

And it is a shame. Secretary Long

Highest Naval Officer
of the World.

Treatment of Hobson.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel.
Washington, March 3.
George Dewey, admiral of the United
States navy, takes rank now as the
highest naval officer in the world. His
nomination was sent to the Senate to
day by President McKinley and was
at once confirmed.
Along with the nomination of Dewey
went that of Elwell S. Otis as brevet
major general in the regular army.
Secretary Long sent the following* to
Admiral Dewey immediately after be
ing notified of the confirmation:
President sends his congratulations on
J your confirmation. LONG.
With respect to Rear Admirals Samp
son and Schley, it looks as if the nom
ination of neither of these officers for
advancement for heroic conduct in bat
tle will be confirmed, but the Senate to
night confirmed their nominations as
rear admirals in accordance with nom
inations submitted to-day under the
provisions of the naval personnel law.
This means that Rear Admiral Schley
will remain two numbers above Rear
i Admiral Sampson, much to the delight
j of the friends of the Maryland officer as
well as those of Commodore Watson.
I Commodore Watson was senior to both
' Sampson and Schley before the war,
i and will remain so, provided their nor
n inations for heroic conduct in battle
are not confirmed.
The failure to confirm Rear Admiral
Cchley for his work at Santiago will
[ be deeply regretted by his friends, as
he will suffer the loss of six numbers
i and the difference between a brigadier
! general's and a major general's pay,
j but there Is such a strong current of
feeling against Rear Admiral Sampson
1 "jumping" him that his friends would
1 prefer to see all nominations for heroic
j service go over until the next session
I rather than permit the confirmation of
! nominations which would place Samp
, son above Schley.
Friends of Constructor Hobson are
; very much dissatisfied with President
McKlnley's so-called promotion of the
j young naval officer. They say he de
': served something better for the extra
ordinary heroism which he displayed at
Santiago.
Some time ago, when it was proposed
; to promote Hobson in the staff, his un
cle, Richmond Pearson, a member of j
; Congress from North Carolina, re- :
j quested Secretary Long to defer this
promotion, as he hoped to have a bill
passed by Congress transferring Hob
son from the staff to the line.
Secretary Long consented, Congress
man Pearson introduced his bill and it
was referred to the Committee on Naval
Affairs. It slumbers there now, for
Boutelle of Maine, chairman of that
committee, opposed the bill for reasons
best known to himself. It is intimated,
however, that certain Naval Bureau
chiefs, Jealous of Hobson's popularity,
were instrumental in having Pearson's
bill pigeon-holed. Representative Pear
son became ill and was not able to bring
the matter to the attention of Con
gress.
Then, as the session neared its close
without prospect of Hobson's transfer
to the line, Secretary Long concluded
to promote him in the list of naval
constructors. This was all he could do
without special authority from Con
gress. He might, however, have ad
vanced Hobson fifteen numbers as well
as not. This would have put him next
to the Chief Constructor, Hichborn.
Instead of that, he was only advanced
from the list of assistant constructors,
where he stood number one. head of
the list, and made number eight in the
regular list of constructors. Their or
der will now be as follows: Hichborn.
Varney, Hanscom, Feaster, Bowles,
Linnard, Woodard, Hobson, Taylor,
etc., so it will be a long time before he
can head the list.
Congress may, at its next session,
authorize his transfer to the line.

THE POLICY
OF PARTITION
Italy's Demand Is Said to Be
Backed by Great
Britain.
Meanwhile the Troubles of the An
cient Kingdom Are Increased
by the Rebellion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PEKING, March 3.â The demand
the Italian Government of China for a
lease of San Mun as a coaling station
and naval base, on the same condi
tions as those under which Germany
hold Klaochau Bay, including a de
mand on the part of Italy for the
cession of three islands off the coast
province 'of Chehkiang, with the right
to construct a railroad/from San Mun
Bay to Po Yang Lake and preferential
mining and railroad rights within a
sphere covering the southern two
thirds of Chehkiang . province, has
caused great excitement here, not only
among the Chinese, but also among
diplomats. - - "â >". -..-
The Chinese are firmly convinced
that Great Britain is chiefly responsible
for the Italian demand, and that it was
made in order to emphasize Great Brit
ain's displeasure at the turn which the
Northern Railway question has taken.
They declare, in proof of this asser
tion, that Great Britain has determined
upon a sphere of influence and the
abandonment of the "open door" pol
icy.
The diplomats openly say that the
new- development is the beginning of a
policy of partition upon the part of
the powers. The representative of a
great power, in the course of conversa
tion, is reported as having said that
the moment has now arrived for inter
national control of China, and it is
added that if the policy of the "spheres
of Influence" is really inaugurated, the
United States is expected to have a
say in the matter, and it is further
said there are Indications that America
is likely to prefer the province of Chili.
REBELS ADVANCE

TACOMA, Wash., March 3.â Chinese

startling news that. thousands of rebels

Anhui, Kiangsu, Hunan and Hupeh
have combined their forces and are
wresting an immense territory from

walled villages, have been captured by
the rebels. They are preparing to be

Kanchou. Late in January a series of
battles took â  place about Kuangy. in
which 4700 rebels are known to have
been slain. Hundreds of Chinese troops
were killed. The "rebels were literally
mowed down by the quick-firing guns
and magazine rifles with which several
regiments of imperial troops were
armed. The latter succeeded in recap

SAN QUENTIN PRISON, March S.
Eight desperate convicts lie ln
solitary confinement in the dun
geon to-night and since their in
carceration in the "black hole" the
prison officials have been fervently con
gratulating one another. That these
murderous prisoners did not regain
their freedom and leave behind them
ghastly evidence of added crime writ
fen in human blood is due solely to the
work of a "stool pigeon" and the
prompt action of the custodians of the
penitentiary. Arms had been smuggled
over the walls, the plan of escape was
well laid and the time was ripe for the
intended break for liberty, but the con
spirators were placed where they could
do no harm just as they were gloating
over the dastardly work that would
have been begun in a few hours' time.
With the incarceration of the con
spirators came the discharge of a
trusted guard under circumstances
pointing to a belief in his complicity in
the -scheme of murder and escape.
While the warden and Captains Birlem
and Edgar will not admit that they be
lieve this guard guilty of complicity,
his discharge at such a time and cer
tain admissions made by them show
that they place entire credence in the
story of the "stool pigeon."
Three weeks ago convict H. W.
Hooper, who is serving three years for
a forgery committed in San Francisco,
sent for Warden Hale, and upon the
promise that he would be properly re
warded for his information, told a story
that made that official open his eyes in
amazement. Hooper said that eight of
the worst prisoners in San Quentin had
formed a plan of escape through the
connivance of accomplices on the out
side and that arms and ammunition
had been smuggled in to them through
the connivance of J. F. Shields, a guard
who formerly lived in Solano County.
They were in possession of keys that
fitted the doors of their cells and at a
time agreed upon were to overpower
the inside guards â not stopping at mur
der if necessary make their es
cape.
The ringleaders were George W.
Schlegal, who is serving a life term for
wrecking a train in Solano County
about eighteen months ago, and Ed
ward Morrell, serving a similar term
for robbery from Fresno. The names
and crimes of the other six are as fol
lows": George Bullock, life-termer, for
murder committed at Santa Cruz;
James Roup, serving a life term for
burglary, with a prior conviction, from
Napa; Joseph King, doing five years'
time for a burglary committed In San
Francisco; H. M. Shaw, life sentence,
sent from Monterey County for murder
in the second degree; "Si" Loven, serv
ing a life sentence for a felony com
mitted in Tulare County, and Alton H.
Gould, serving fifteen years, from Santa
Cruz, for burglary in the first degree.
These are eight of the worst convicts
ever sent to San Quentin prison. Mor
rell is the man who aided Chris Evans
to escape from the Fresnp jail, and
Bullock tried to escape from the upper
room of the old hospital four years ago.
Schlegal, the principal of . the ring
leaders, served a prior term for burg
lary, and has the reputation of caring
no more for a man's life than for that
of a dog. Roup is commonly referred
to as "Brockie," on account of num
erous pock marks: on his face. He has
given the officials trouble on various
occasions. Gould is the convict who
escaped from San Quentin on Septem
ber IS last by getting Into the women's

PLOT TO FORCE AN
EXTRA SESSION OF
THE LEGISLATURE
Burns' Latest Scheme to Break Into
the United States Senate.
BETRAYED BY ONE OF HIS TOUTS
Attempt to Adjourn the Legislature Without
Passing the General Appropriation Bill
or Fixing the Tax Levy.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA- ,
MENTO. March To-morrow Dan M.
Burns will see his latest scheme to elect
himself Senator from California go sput
tering out. when a motion to adjourn this !
Legislature is voted down in both Senate
and Assembly. \
This last job of Burns and his versatile j
gang is as cleverly characteristic as any
of the many they have yet put up. It is ;
decidedly more far reaching. It compre- |
bends the adjournment of the present ses- |
sion and the calling of an extra session j
by the Governor, with the unpassed gen
eral appropriation bill as the Executive's
excuse for his action. It contemplates a
general canvass of the Republican major- j
ity after the members have reached their j
homes, where they will be amenable to a j
quiet talk and the strongest pull that Dan
Burns and hfs master, the railroad, can
bring to bear upon them for a general Re- j
publican caucus on the Senatorial question j
when the extra session shall have been
called.
The Governor of the State, the members
of this Legislature, whether they vote
for Burns or not, and every tout and po
litical hanger-on that Dan Burns and Mr.
Herrin can muster, have been figured on
as actors in the whole crooked scheme.
That it will fail to-morrow is due pri
marily to a slip in the management.
All day to-day Grove L. Johnson and
Assemblyman Dibble. Burns' logical lead
ers have canvassed the Legislature.
They have broached the proposition to
adjourn the Legislature to-morrow sine
die despite the tact that the general ap
propriation bill has not been passed nor j
the tax levy made. To win supporters to
their scheme they have pandered to and
argued every condition that might induce
a none too affluent legislator to drop the
work for which he is no longer paid and
go back to his occupation and constitu
ents. â  . ,
The burden of their arguments has been
that under the law none of them will re
ceive remuneration for their labors from
yesterday, and that with the mass of
work before them they will be obliged to
remain here for the next twenty days at
MEXICAN DAN: "Scy.-Cuy. Who Put Me Into This Senatorial Figrht, Anyway?"
least at their own expense. As an alter
native inducement, they are told that the
general appropriation bill need not be
passed until near the end of the present
fiscal year, and that the Governor must
then call an extra session and they will
all receive their mileage and per diem,
and he enabled to not only get the ap
propriation hill through, but call up their
own pet measures if the Governor can be
induced to include general legislation in
his call. v.
They have argued that the one impor
tant duty of the Legislature is to elect a
Senator, and that it is demonstrated that
this cannot be done. Loudly they have
bawled out through the halls to-day that
the deadlock cannot be broken. It has
been a good day's work and not one
thing in the line of persuasive argument
has been overlooked. .and as late as 5
o'clock this afternoon the touts were as
suring each other that the success of the
job was assured.
It might have been but for a slip made
by one of the ringleaders at a meeting to
day of the Assembly Committee on Rules.
Enough of the inside of the job was
thrown down inadvertently to set on foot
an investigation. It began among the
Democrats first, then it became noised
abroad, and there are few in either house
to-night of either party who are not in
formed of every detail. They all. how
ever, disclaim belief that Governor Gage
has knowingly lent himself to the further
ance of the Mexican's plan, although he
was scheduled to play the leading part
and make the whole scheme operative by
calling an extra session. .
With this session adjourned sine die to
morrow Dan Burns would have two
months at least, it was figured, to send
his agents to the home of every repre
sentative in the State. Every pull and
corporate influence the Mexican controls
or can borrow could be quietly used to
get an agreement to caucus on the Sen
atorial question as soon as the extra ses
sion should be called. That Dan Burns
might reasonably look to such an agree
ment is demonstrated by the overwhelm
ing Influence he has brought to bear here
to bring men to his way of thinking at
a time and place where every move has
been watched and chronicled. Under
cover of the privacy of their homes they
might be expected to consent to a plan
which the dread of exposue would hold
them from up here in the broad light of

day.
In adjourning without the appropria
tion bill passed an extra session. would be
assured. The running expenses .of â  the
State are provided for only until July 1,
and the government, could hot continue
for two years longer without the appor
tionment of the State's funds and the fix
ing of the tax levy.
An agreement reached with sixty-one
members.to caucus upon their return here
and the extra session would resolve it
self merely into a scheme for the elec
tion of Burns.
It is this the Mexican has worked for
and lost to-day. Dan Burns cannot be
elected as conditions- are now. He knows
it, and his touts know it; not only faith,
but hope has gone from them. They con
fess it. Not one of them to-day but will
confess himself for the present beaten.
Their fight has resolved itself into noth
ing more patriotic than a determination
to win or maintain this deadlock, and
they themselves concede that the latter
is all they can hope to do. '
To-night the gang gave the fight up as
hopeless. It looked bright up to 5 o'clock,
but as soon as the nigger in Mr. Burns'
latent woodpile came into evidence the
sentiment changed. Those who are still
ready to stand for the scheme are a few
of the Democrats and nearly all the Re
publicans of the San Francisco delegation.
One phase of the layout was blocked by
Valentine, chairman of the "Ways and
Means Committee. In paving the way
for their plan the Burns people have for
several days been attempting to prevail
upon Valentine to report back to the As
sembly the two resolutions introduced
two weeks ago to adjourn to-morrow. To
day he reported them back, but with the
recommendation that they be not adopted,
and a careful canvass of the members
to-night puts beyond the peradvertture of
a doubt that the report will be adopted
to-morrow. The motion to adjourn, how
ever, will be made unless the plan ex
pressed to-night by the Burns people falls
to the ground.
STRATTON'S PRIMARY
ELECTION BILL SIGNED
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 3.â Senator Stratton's
primary bill has become a law. It was
signed by the Governor this morning and
during the afternoon his message of ap
proval was transmitted to the Senate. It
is one of the most important of the elec
tion measures that have been before this
Legislature, and according to its author
it js the best primary law in the coun
try.
The most prominent feature of the act
is that it requires that every nominating
convention shall- be formed by a primary
election, thus knocking out any commit
tees of one hundred, or appointed
bodies controlled by one man or set of
men. It provides for an election con
ducted just as is the general election,
with the same register and the same pre
cautions to secure secrecy, the only prac
tical difference being the ballot used.
The ballot is printed with blank spaces
for the writing in by the voter of the
names of those he wishes to see in the
convention of his party. State, munici
pal, county and district conventions are
all down on the ballot, and there is a
space for the conventions of each of the
parties which east at least 3 per cent of
the vote at the preceding election. To
make sure, however, that nobody votes
for any candidates except those of his
own party it is expressly provided that if
any ballot bears the name* of candidates i
for different political conventions It shall :
be disregarded in the count. It follows :
from this that lf a man starts to vote fo>
the candidates of one party for one con- >
vention he must vote for the candidates of
the same party for the other conventions i
or he will lose his vote altogether. There i
is nothing to prevent him from selecting !
whatever party candidates he wishes, but
having selected he must abide by his'
choice throughout the whole ballot. This i
Insures a. strict party vote.
It is provided that primary elections be ;
called on the second Tuesday in the month

TWO AMENDMENTS TO THE
OAKLAND HARBOR BILL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 3.â Senator Leavitt's
Oakland harbor bill came up on the Sen
ate special file In the Assembly this af
ternoon and Wright of Alameda offered
two amendments to it, which the promot
ers of the measure and the people of Oak
land considered advisable.
The first amendment so changes the de
scription of the. property over which the
proposed Harbor Commissioners shall
have control that it does not tend to con
firm titles claimed to certain sections of
the front by private parties. Under the
amendment the description is as follows:
Section 6. . The Raid commissioners, for the
purposes in this act provided, shall have pos
session and control and jurisdiction over alt the
right, title and interest which the people of
the State of California or the city of Oakland,
or any other municipality, now has or may
hereafter have within all or any of the follow
ing described lands, waters and premises, to
wit: -â ;â---â¢---:â 
Beginning at the point of intersection of the
present northern boundary line of the town of
Berkeley with the line of ordinary high tide
on the east shore of the bay of San Francisco,
and running thence southerly along and fol
lowing said line of ordinary high tide as It
existed previous to artificial filling; to the
mouth of the estuary of San Antonio: thence
easterly along and following said line of ordi
nary high tide as it existed previous to artifi
cial filling up of said estuary to the north arm
thereof, the arm extending up to Lake Merrltt;
thence across said north arm to the line of
ordinary hlch tide as It existed before the
artificial filling on the eastern shore of said
north arm; thence along and following said
line of ordinary high tide as It existed previous
to artificial filling, easterly, southerly and
westerly to the line of ordinary high tide as it
existed previous to artificial filling, along the
east shore of the bay of Han Francisco, that is.
following said line of ordinary high tide as It
existed previous to artificial filling up to and
! around what Is commonly known as the Brook
lyn basin, and thence down said estuary of San
Antonio on and along the line of ordinary high
tide as It existed previous to artificial fllling on
Its south shore to its mouth, thence due west to
the western boundary line of the county of
Alameda.
The second amendment creates a new
section to the bill as follows: .
Nothing contained in. this act shall be con
strued to divest the city of Oakland to any
title to. interest in or right of control over
â aid premises except so far as may be neces
sary to the exercise by said Board of Harbor
Commissioners of the powers hereby conferred j
upon them. X..7: .
The amendments were adopted and the
bill ordered back to the printer.
DRURY MELONE'S SCHEME
MEETS WITH A SETBACK
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 3.â Unless Drury Melone
does some heavy' work among the mem
bers of the Assembly his fond dream of
augmented wealth will be but a myth.
This evening the Assembly Judiciary
Committee reported the bill regarding the
appointment of city officials by the Gov
ernor, where there has been a failure to do
so by the people, for the period of two
years, back to the Assembly with an un
favorable recommendation by a vote of
10 to 4. The bill directly applies to the
town of Placerville. â¢"-.â¢.â¢
The story of the attempt by Drury Mc\
lone, a Napa capitalist, to gain control of
the town of Placerville has been fully told
in The Call. It seems that in the early
sixties the town of Placerville was in need
of a railroad, and the Sacramento Rail
road Company agreed to build one from
the terminus of the Southern Pacific to
Placerville, providing the town would
bond Itself to the Sacramento Railroad
Company for half the cost of the con
struction of the road. The town was bond
ed for $250,000, but the railroad failed to
come up to its agreement and only built
the road part way. Since then the town
has virtually been incorporated, but with
out officers, as by electing them the peo
ple would be throwing the town open to
suit. Drury Melone has of late been buy
ing up the bonds at about one-fourth of
their face value and has conceived the
scheme of using the Legislature to com
pel the people to elect officers so that he
can make collection through the courts.
The flagrancy of the scheme has been dis
covered by the committee, hence its re
port. ' - â

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March The county govern
ment bill made its debut In the Senate
this afternoon, and after being tinkered
with to the extent of two amendments
it went over until Monday for further
consideration. It is a bulky document,
and it will take several days, to get
through with it. The bill changes the
powers of Supervisors in the construction
of public works. so as to allow them to
order work of a value less than $2500
without advertising, and making It op
tional with them as to advertising for
work of greater value than that sum. It
also allows bidders to submit their own
plans when bidding. This change was
opposed by Bulla and Shortridge, and was
finally changed back to the present law.
The present law compels Supervisors to
advertise for all work of a greater value
than $600, and compels the drawing of
plans for all bidders to bid upon. The
bill also allows the taxing of towns for
the road work done on the roads In the
same districts as the towns, and this
Bulla sought to amend by exempting
tn-n'ns from this tax. His amendment was

BURNS DECLARES
HE WILL RULE OR
RUIN THE PARTY
Makes Good His Threat to Issue an
Address to the Public.
DEMANDS A "BOBTAILED" CAUCUS
Brazen Proposition Whereby Thirty-One Mem
bers, or Ten Less Than Half the Re
s publican Majority, Shall Control.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 3.â Pursuant to the agree
ment entered yesterday, Dan Burns to
day, through his supporters, issued an
address to the public, in which he at
tempts to justify the position he now oc
cupies before the people as a -candidate
for the office of United. States Senator.
The address was drawn up by Assembly
men Johnson and Dibble and Senator
Leavltt, Burns' new steering committee,
and in every respect is just such a docu
ment- as might be expected to emanate
from these gentlemen, who are the recog
nized leaders of the Mexican's forces in
the Legislature.
In a speech made to his supporters yes
terday Burns pledged himself and his fol
lowers to force Republican legislators into
a caucus, or, in the event of their re
fusal, to prevent the election of a United
States Senator, and thereby injure the
Republican party and jeopardize the wel
fare of the entire State.
To-day he insults the Republican legis
lators and the people of the State by put
ting those threats in writing and publish
ing them to the world. He states plainly
that the Republican legislators must
accede to his wishes and go into caucus,
or the twenty-seven men who .are now
voting for him will continue to so vote
and thus prevent the election of a Sen
ator.
Those who read the address of the Can
delaria candidate will remember that his
candidacy was announced by W. F. Her
' rin, political manager for the Southern
[ Pacific Company, many weeks before the
! convening of the Legislature, as well as
I before any newspaper in the State thought
of mentioning him as a Senatorial possi
bility; that his acts as a candidate have
been marked by every trick and confi
dence scheme known to politics, and now
that he finds himself defeated he seeks to
justify himself and his acts by setting
forth "a state of alleged facts that do not
and have not existed, and by threatening
to disrupt the party and Injure the State
if his commands are not complied with.
His address is as follows:
When the results of the election held in
1898 were- ascertained. It was found that
eighty-five Republican members of the
Legislature, out of a total membership of
121. had been elected. When the Legisla
ture convened January 2, 1859. it became its
highest duty to elect a United States Sen
tor to succeed Bon. Stephen M. White,
whose term expires March 4. 1.99. Upon
the Republican members, numbering twen
ty-four more than a majority. - rested the
solemn obligation to select a Senator who
would represent the Republican party, and
be a firm supporter of our Republican
President and his administration.
For over eight weeks that obligation has
been unperformed, that duty neglected.
The blame rests upon the Republican ma
jority and must be bÂ»rne by. themâ
though the consequences of this unfulfilled
duty will fall upon the Republican party
at large. That the members of our party
may understand our position and put their
condemnation on the proper persons, .we
Issue this statement:
We have support*- a candidate, Hon.
Daniel M. Burns, who. in our Judgment,
possesses the necessary qualifications to
make a good official and properly repre
sent our Stat. .Â»'-._*->" .
Other Republican legislators, for reasons
sufficient for their judgment, have sup
ported other persons equally fit for the
position. For eight weeks the contest has
continued and now, with but at best a
few days remaining of the session, we are
no nearer, apparently, a conclusion than
at the beginning. Â*,*.'.
Why is this so? . **_ -, '-; â '-'
The answer is plain. Because the time
honor-- custom of all political parties of
holding a caucus to select a candidate has
been abandoned. This country has a rep
resentative government; all selections of
officials are decided by a vote of the per
sons entitled to act thereon, and the selec
tion of a majority, no matter how small
numerically, becomes, by the force of law.
the selection of all. This law of the land
has become by usage the law of political
parties. It is essential to the perpetuity
of our free Institutions that this law should
continue to govern the nation, for without
It anarchy would reign, petty principali
ties would usurp the place of sovereign
States, and the Federal Union become a
meaningless phrase. It is absolutely neces
sary to the preservation of a political party
that this law should govern the delibera
tions of its members, for without it a
party becomes a mere mob, without cohe
sive power, a rope of sand only powerful
to Injure itself and its friends when
sought to be used to benefit the party or
advance its principles.
From the commencement of this Senator
ial struggle to the present hour our can
didate and ourselves have continuously
asked for a caucus of the Republican mem
bers of the Legislature.
That caucus to be one where no
secret ballot would be used, that
caucus to consist of not less than
sixty-one members, a majority of

decide now, as in the past, who
should be the choice of our party
for United States Senator.
Without good reason our respectful re
quests for a caucus have been refused, our
urgent appeals have been denied. The re
sult is apparent to all; no Senator will be
elected; If none is elected at this session
the election of â¢ 1900 will have this ex
traneous Issue forced into it; the best fruit
of our victory of 189S will be turned to dust
in our grasp and the Democratic party will
be given another opportunity to secure a
Senator lost by them ln fair battle.
History teaches us that the result, of
political contests can never be accurately
foretold and that victories in elections in
California frequently change with their fre
quent recurrence.
The loss to our party of a. Senator for
two years will be incalculable, injuring us
daily In new. places and by creating, un

California will be only half represented for

and with only half a delegation they will
suffer without fault on the part of our one
Senator.

His Latest Threat Will Not Force
Them Into a Caucus.
PUBLIC INDIGNATION IS AROUSED
Burns' Impudence in Demanding That the
Majority Shall Rule and Then Refusing
to Obey the. Majority's Will.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 3.â Burns ls squarely
confronted with the decree of the ma
jority that he cannot be elected United
States Senator. He now threatens that
the vacancy in the Senate, that will b.
caused by the retirement of Stephen M.
White, shall not be rilled by this Legis
lature. It remains to be seen whether
he can execute his threat to deprive the
Republican party and the people of Cali
fornia of their just representation in the
Congress of the United States. During
his career as a political boss he has made
some bold bluffs and openly defied public
â¢sentiment, but he has never before dared
to defy the people of this great common
wealth in the high-handed manner that
he now assumes.
The proclamation inspired by Burns,
and written by Assemblymen Johnson
and Dibble, is sure to arouse public in
dignation. It is clearly apparent to-night j
that the so-called address signed by the !
Burns henchmen has crystallized the anti- j
Burns sentiment in the Legislature.
Members who had considered the idea of
going home before the adjournment of j
the Legislature have now resolved to stay
until the finish or until Burns has le
tired from the field.
The opinion is expressed here to-night
by the ablest men of the Legislature that
â the manifesto, stripped of verbiage,
simply means this: "There are twenty
seven out of eighty-five Senators and As
semblymen who support the pretensions
of D. M. Burns for United States Senator, j
We demand that the other fifty-eight
Senators and Assemblymen, or enough of ,
them to elect a Senator, say sixty-one, ,
ehall go into a party convention or cau- j
cus which a bare majority shall control,
and be bound by a vote of forty-three
cr thirty-one, as the case may be. We
can never elect Burns by a majority of
.the Senate and Assembly in joint conven
tion. Therefore Burns demands a party
caucus which we believe we can control
by the help of those who are secretly
allied to us. but not ready to openly _**-
pouse his cause. If Burns is not award
.'td a caucus we will see to it there shall
be no Senator." Â«-â¢__'â "-__ wâ
' This is his demand, and this the penalty
of a refusal. The difficulty of this posi
tion lies in the fact that while the party
may decide the question of a caucus or no
caucus. Burns, simply because he is one
of several candidates competing for Sen- â 
atorial honors, has no right, moral or
otherwise, to demand one. If his right
to demand a caucus is conceded, then any
other candidate has the privilege of de
manding that there be no caucus at ail.
Mr. Grant has openly voting tor him
â  one more legislator than has Burns. He
declares against a caucus, and for reasons
eminently satisfactory to himself asks â 
that Mr. Burns' orders be not complied |
with. Is there any time-honored custom \
that decides which of these candidates
shall have his way? If the answer to this j
query is that neither candidate can de- i
mand anything, but that the whole body,
acting together, shall decide their conten
tions, then It is plain that the question is |
settled against Burns. -;â¢
. A "conference" of all the Republican
members of the Legislature was held a ,
few days ago, when Henry C. Dibble, on ,
Burns' behalf, proposed in effect that
the "conference" resolve itself into a
"caucus," to be governed by such rules as |
the majority might thereafter determine. j
This may not have been the precise word- \
Ing, but is the substance. The result was j
that the party resolved to adjourn sine
die so far as the caucus proposition was
concerned, and did so. Burns had his I
day in court then and there. The verdict
was against him by a vote of 48 to 29.
That ended the caucus business, and with j
It ended the last glimmer of hope that ;
twenty-seven men, with three or four
whom Burns had up his sleeve, could rule
the Republican party of California and
enable him to become, for the sole purpose
' of self-vindication, a United States Sena
tor.
There has never been a doubt that the
Republican party of California as a
whole does not desire Burns as its
representative in the United States Sen
re There is no Senator or Assemblyman
who does not know this to be the fact.
With the exception of certain well-known
-subsidized or controlled newspapers, the
press of the State is against him, and that
mighty power, the public Judgment of the
land, Is protesting that his election would j
be a political crime never to be condoned
or forgotten. He may be right or wrong,
good or bad, sinful or holy, entitled to
vindication from slander and libel, or con
dign punishment for a variety of felonies.
The Republican party has no concern with
either condition, and decides nothing but
that it does not want him and will not
have him for its Senatorial representative.
It has decided the violation of its will
means political death to him who defies
Two-thirds of the Republicans in the
Legislature know this as well
as they all know their pay stopped

demand, emphasized by Grove Johnson s
â¢ Flobbering pen, drive two-thirds, or any
part of them, Into a caucus where the de
mands of their constituents shall be ig

are to be debated and determined in the
face of seventy millions of Americans.
The Republican party itself is not wholly
united. The interests of California de
mand that President McKinley's hands
be hold up and the administration sus
tained. But the Republican party of
California is also aware that we are near
ing another Presidential election. It de
sires that its union shall be so perfect
that the State shall wheel Into the Re
publican column. If Mr. Burns is de
feated and if his threat of "No Senator
unless it be Senator Burns" Is carried into
effect the United States Senate will still
remain where it is; but, if he is elected
by the manipulation of a fragment of our
legislators the party will suffer an in
curable injury and those who help to in
flict this cruel wrong upon the common
decencies of political life will have to
settle with the people for It,
It is for these reasons that an over
whelming majority of the members of
the Legislature have decided that there
shall be no caucus, and that for this rea
son, at least, the political tail shall not
wag the political dog. To this deter
mination the people are giving hearty con
currence, and the Burns-Johnson wail
will go for naught.
The men supporting Barnes, Grant and
Scott regard the Burns manifesto as a
threat that no Senator shall be chosen at
this session. It is in line with Burns' ar
rogant assumption that he is boss of the
State and ls in absolute control.
A few days ago in an interview with a
Southern California member of the Leg
islature Burns remarked:
"I gave Southern California a Gover
nor." -...
Subsequently, in the Republican confer
ence. Senator Shortridge. in a speech
which reflected the feelings of Burns, de
clared that the "Colonel" was entitled to
the distinction of bringing forward to
victory Henry T. Gage. There is nothing
in the past or the future that Burns is
not claiming. The touts are assuming
that Burns has an Individual right to a
caucus, when the fact is well established
that the right of caucus belongs to the
party and not to the individal. The rep
resentatives of the party In the Legisla
ture decided by a vote of 4S to 29 that they
did not desire a caucus. - -
The caucus question has been definitely
settled and will not be reopened, and if it
were reopened Burns would have no
claim to caucus consideration, as he was
not suspected of being a candidate when
the people were called upon to vote for
members of the Legislature. In this sense
he is not a candidate in good faith and is
not entitled to consideration. Comment is
made on the fact that he is now threat
ening to punish the Republican party and
the people of the State with the loss of a
Senator because the members of the Leg
islature refuse to bow to the yoke of the
Southern Pacific.
Reference is made to-night to the many
favors that the Republican party has lav
ished on Boss Burns. He was made Sec
retary of State under the administration
of Governor Perkins. lie was ap
pointed Police Commissioner by
Governor Markham, and his brother
in-law was appointed Registrar of
Voters of San Francisco. Nearly half the
patronage belonging to the loyal Repub
lican;* who supported Markham was
placed at the disposal of Burns, but not
withstanding these rich rewards Burns
paid back the party by bolting the regu
lar legislative nominations in San Fran
cisco and contributing to the election of
a Democratic United States Senator six
years ago. Now he threatens to deprive
the party of its Just representation in
Congress.
Comment also is made on the fact that
the great victory of last November was
achieved because Burns was not con
spicuous.
There is a growing belief that Burns
has gone a step beyond the toleration of
the railroad company â a step that will
provoke a bitter feeling of hostility
toward the corporation in every section of
the State. -Johnson's address, which was
inspired by Burns, approved by Dibble
and applauded by Kenneally. is a direct
slap in the face of the public. The "or
ganization" spits in the eye of the people
with the remark:
"You will take Burns or get no Sena
tor."
To-night the following letter was re
ceived in this city:
SAN FRANCISCO, March 3, 1839.
Hon. W. H. t_ Barnes, Sacramento, Cal. â My
Dear Sir: I have Just heard that It was the
Intention of some of the members of the Rich
mond District Improvement Association to call
a meeting to-night to indorse the candidacy of
Daniel M. Burns. '_'>_._
I have not called any such meeting, neither
do I approve of it, nor will I attend It. So.
should they call the meeting and take such
action or publish any such movement, remem
ber that It ls not done with my consent or
approval.
I am for V?. H. D. Barnes for United States
Senator, have been from the commencement,
and expect to be until your victory is an
nounced.
Hoping you will win the fight, I am very
sincerely yours. CHARLES H. HUBBS,
President Richmond District Improvement As
sociation.
There are no indications to-night of ma
terial change in the joint ballot to
morrow.
Reports are in circulation that more
votes may be added to General Barnes'
list, but the expected accessions may not
be recorded before next Tuesday. The
Grant. managers assert that the ranks of
the San Diego statesman are as firm as
ever and cannot be broken as long as
Burns ls in the neld. The Southern Cali
fornia members who recently joined the
column of General Barnes are receiving
many messages of congratulation and
approval from their constituents.
Assemblyman Hocy of San Francisco is
indignant to-night. The Sacramento Bee
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1899.
this evening made the statement that he
was one of the Democrats who intended
to vote for Dan Burns. He flatly contra
dicts the assertion and distinctly declares,
and authorizes the publication of his dec
laration, that he will never vote for Burns
or any other Republican candidate for
United States Senator. He says he came
here as a Democrat and will vote for a
Democrat until the end of the session.
The general expression of opinion to
night is to the effect that no Senator will
be chosen by this session of the Legis
lature. The Republicans who oppose the
election of Burns on the ground that he is
not a worthy or acceptable man consti
tute more than two-thirds of the Republi
can membership of the Legislature. They
are ready to refer the question back to
the people, firmly believing that the State
would rather be minus one Senator for
two years than submit to the disgrace of
Burns' election for six years.

this Legislature should select the candidate
that all could support. "
Our appeals have fallen upon deaf ears,
our suggestions have been ignored, our re
quests have been denied. We have been
told that no caucus would be held because
a majority might select our candidate, and
at no time has any other reply been made
to us; such an answer Is un-Republican, un
patriotic, devoid of reason, without force
and unworthy cf men anxious to benefit the
party, the people, the State, the nation, and
to perform their duty to the Republicans
who elected them to office.
Now, as ever, we say for our candidate
and ourselves, that In accordance with the
time-honored custom of all political parties,
in obedience to the will of the masses of
the Republican party, we are ready
to enter into a caucus of the Republican
members of the Legislature to consist of
net less than sixty (that being, in conse
quence of the death of one Senator, a ma
jority), and to abide loyally by the decis
ion of the majority of that caucus, no mat
ter what candidate may be selected.
We make no threats, we indulge ln no
boasts, but we are men who know our
duties to our candidate, ourselves and our
party, and we hereby solemnly declare that
It Is our fixed and unalterable purpose to
continue voting for our candidate, Hon.
Daniel M. Burns, until the close of this
session, unless a caucus of the Republican
members of the Legislature ls held in ac
cordance with the views hereinabove ex

AMENDMENTS TO THE
CONSTITUTION PASSED
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March The morning hours of
the Senate session to-day were devoted to
the consideration of constitutional
amendments.
Cutter's Senate amendment providing
for the payment of the salaries of Su
perior Judges by the State was passed.
/Taylor's Senate amendment to exempt
bonds of the State, or any county or mu
nicipal corporation within it from taxa_
tion, was passed. His idea was that the
bonds could never be found by the As
sessor anyway, and If they were exempted
the interest could be reduced, and so the
loss of the tax on the few bonds reached
would be more than made up in the re
duction of the Interest on all.
Merrill's Assembly amendment exempt
ing the Lick school property in San Fran
cisco from taxation was lost, as was also
Cobb's Assembly amendment exempting
from taxation all property belonging to
free schools. The Senate had grown
tired of exempting property, having
obliged the churches and Stanford Uni
versity in that way, and it would stand
no more exemptions. Notice of a mo
tion to reconsider both hills was given.
Morehouse's bill to so change the code
as to allow an heir to set aside a deed
made by an ancestor to defraud him of
his rights in the estate of that ancestor,
was brought up for reconsideration on
motion of Senator Davis. The bill passed
the Senate a few days ago with but little
to spare and after much opposition had
been shown to it. It was characterized
as a dangerous measure and one that
would destrop all security of land titles,
and when the bill was brought up ails
evening the same- arguments were again
threshed over. Davis submitted an
amendment allowing the wife to set
aside such a deed as is described in tne
bill and then Morehouse submitted an
amendment to this amendment auding
the children to this latitude.
Both amendments were voted down, and
the bill went to rollcall for passage. It re
oulred a call of the Senate and a half
hour's hard lobbying on the part of the
friends of the bill to get it through again.
It passed by Just the necessary twenty-
Senator Dickinson submitted a bill un
der suspension of the rules appropriating
$10 000, or as much of it as may be needed,
for the contingent expenses of the Senate.
He also introduced two bills allowing the
clerk of the Supreme Court to appoint five
deputies and providing for their pay. Also
five claims from newspapers for advertis
ing constitutional amendments under the
probably mistaken notion that they would
be paid. " ' .' _ _Â, ' -
Senator Smith introduced a bill appro
priating $800 to pay the expenses of the
funeral of the late State Treasurer Levi
Ratcliffe, who was burled by the State..
A glimpse of the end of the session
came in a joint resolution submitted by
Senator Smith, which provides for the
final adjournment of the Legislature on
Wednesday, March 15, at midnight. "We
have to do something of that sort and
make a start some time,", was Smith's
comment on his resolution. "We will
hardly make It on time, but when we
come to the 15th we must extend the time,
that's all." . ; .;-
As a wind-up to the evening session the
Senate took up Shortridge's bill to make
possible a Hen â  on a horse by the unpaid
blacksmith who shod him, which was de
feated some days ago. Shortridge de
clared that his record as a- statesman de
pended upon the bill, and he appealed to
each Senator personally to vote in its fa
vor. There was great merriment over
his speech and over the entrance of on_
of the sergeants at arms, who bore a gi
gantic floral horseshoe as an offering on
the expected bier of the bill. When the
roll was called there were but three votes
for the bill. Shortridge voted against it
himself, evidently with the intention of
moving for another reconsideration; but
as soon as the roll call had been finished,
and before the result of the vote was an
nounced, Senators began to change from
no to aye and the votes In favor grew
until the bill had two short of enough fo*r
its passage. There was a call of the
House, the two necessary votes were se
cured and with just the required twenty
one votes, the record of Senator Short
ridge as a statesman became assured.
ASSEMBLYMEN MIXED UP
IN A SERIES OF ROWS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March ,3.â The Assembly got'
started off wrong to-day. It got but of
bed on the wrong side, or broke its look
ing-glass, or something, and there was
trouble from rollcall to adjournment.
It developed Into a' warm little three
cornered row this afternoon with Valen
tine, Dibble and Johnson each holding
down a corner, and later it was a combi
nation of Johnson and Dibble against
Valentine and the general appropriation
bill.
Some of Dibble's embroidery work on
the flies started the fuss. As chairman
and the rest of the Rules Committee he
offered a fresh paragraph to the rules,
providing that certain deficiency bills be
taken up to-night. There was no objec
tion to that, but there was to the fact
that certain bills had been ignored. It was

TALK OF MAJORITY RULE
â¢ CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, March J
Â© 3.â D. M. Burns is not the people's candidate for United Â©
Â© States Senator, but was put forward as a candidate by the Â©
' Southern Pacific Company, and as such is not entitled to any
I consideration at the hands of the people. !
I In spite of his knowledge of the fact that, he is held in 1
â¢ disesteem by nine-tenths of the people of the State, he persists â¢
Â© in remaining a candidate at the risk of ruining his party and â¢
Â© robbing the State of a representative in the upper house of Â©

expressed by Valentine, -Who moved as an
amendment that his Assembly bill 581 be
added to the list. Dibble kicked and
Johnson mixed in the row for no other
apparent reason than the fun he could
get out of it. Dibble got the best end of
it, and then Belshaw tried to get on with
a bill of his own. Hanley of San Fran
cisco moved to lay Belshaw's motion on
the table, thinking, that if carried, it
would table Dibble's new rule as well.
Johnson and Valentine were of the same
opinion, and backed Hanley against Dib
ble " ..â "*â â -.
After a warm squabble Speaker Ander
son decided that the motion to table Bel
shaw's amendment did not carry the
rule with it, and Dibble demanded the
previous question. His rule was adopted.
At -4 o'clock the general appropriation
bill was taken up and Johnson got into
line with Dibble in a fight to effect some
changes that for one reason or another
they deemed necessary. The bill was, of
course, considered by the House sitting
in committee of the whole. Valentine was
first to Interrupt the reading with an
amendment to add $1200 to Secretary of
State Curry's printing fund for the pur
pose of printing the constitutional amend
ments to be proposed at the next election.
The amendment was adopted.
Then Johnson threw down his hand. He
moved to increase Curry's $9000 printing
allowance to $12,000. He said Mr. Curry
could not print the State Blue Book un
less the increase were allowed him. Cam-
Inettl said if the blue book missed publi
cation congratulations would be due th.
State. His opinion was echoed by about
everybody in the chamber save the
tongue-tied few whose speeches Johnson
is in the habit of making.
Valentine said Curry's allowance had
been finally passed yesterday, and denied
Johnson's right to call it up again.
Grovel insisted, but tried to hedge by
saying that he only offered the amend
ment at Curry's request. Valentine said
that Curry had told him and the rest of
the Committee on Ways and Means that
$9000 would be quite enough for him.
Johnson said Curry told him quite the
contrary. Dibble got in with Johnson and
the aggregate racket kicked up was any
thing but edifying. Johnson's amend
ment, however, was finally lost.
Dibble cut loose from the Sacramentan
on the next round and went over to Val
entine. The question was on a clerkship
created In the adjutant generals depart
ment by an additional appropriation of
$3200. Dibble wanted the clerk appointed
because he wants some one to collect and
care for relics and mementos of the Re
bellion and -the late war with Spain. He
has a bill coming up shortly which pro
vides for about the same thing, and be
sides helping the project to-day he also
took advantage of the opportunity to
make an eloquent speech in favor of his
forthcoming measure.
Johnson saw a chance to get even for
the defeat of the Curry amendment. He
said that if he could get one of. the San
Francisco delegation to second his motion
he would see to It that not another sec
tion of the bill should be considered until
that clerkship should be cut out. The
delegation sided with him against Dibble
and Valentine, and the section was or
dered stricken from the bill.
The $5000 appropriation for the mainten
ance of the training ships of the Naval
Battalion was so amended that $3000 of
the amount should be for the use of the
Marion and .2000 for the Pinta.
The bill '-ill come up for further consid
eration to-morrow.

It recommends that a new building for
the foundry and machine department be

Shall Women VoteP
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 3.â Senator Shortrld-. .
burst into eloquence this afternoon over
Johnson's Assembly bill to allow women
to vote at school elections and for school
officers. Shortridge wanted the bill put
over until Monday, when there would be
time to properly consider it, and after
some discussion' this was done. The dis
cussion developed two more friends be
sides Shortridgeâ Smith and Morehouseâ
and one opponent, Gillette. There were
a few words said upon the constitution
ality of the bill and a few. more on the
broad question of woman suffrage.
Shortridge said he knew jhe could con
vince the Supreme Court that the bill was
all right. Smith read a list of States in
which a law similar .to the one proposed
in the bill had been put In force, and
then he read another list of those States
in which the law had been attacked and
had been sustained by the Supreme
Courts of those States.
Morehouse believed an intelligent wo
man had as much right to vote as a man,
and Gillette declared if they could allow
women to vote they could allow minors
to do so.
There was no objection to allowing the
bill to remain over until Monday and then
the fight will be on.
A Well-Signed Petition.

thereby created one of ; the faculty of the
veterinarian department of- the State Uni

give their time to the State gratuitously,
or nearly so, and that -they, should be
shown some consideration if.it should
come to pass that a place one of them
could fill should be formed. Already the
petition has received the signatures of

MENTO, March 3.â Milton J. Green has
been given until next Wednesday to appear
before the Assembly and purge : himself
of contempt.' When his name was called
to-day neither himself nor a "certificate"
answered to it. Grove L. Johnson, how
ever, said that when Green was here in
the middle of the week he had explained
to him that he was obliged to return at
once to Oakland because of the sudden
and serious illness of .his wife. Upon this
explanation he asked for further time.
Dibble moved to give him until Wednes
day; Johnson amended by moving to have
Green taken in charge by the- sergeant
at-arms if he should come to Sacramento
between now and Wednesday. The motion
was carried as amended. Altogether it
was a very clear and friendly tip to Mr.
Green to stay- away, and one which Mr.
Green will probably gladly accept.
Pico's Claim Turned Down.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 3.â The claim of Major
Pico came before the Senate Finance
Committee this evening and was reported
back with an unfavorable recommenda
tion. For the past three sessions Pico has
endeavored to get his claim allowed by
the Legislature and this is the first time
it has been turned down by a committee.
Heretofore It has passed opt of the hands
of the committees and has been vetoed by
the Governor, but this time it will prob
ably meet its finish in the Senate. It is
a claim to pay Pico $8111 for equipping
four companies of men during the Mexi
can war. Considerable surprise is evinced
by a number of members of the Legisla
ture on account of the committee's action,
as it was thought the claim would pass. The
committee also reported unfavorably upon
the bill to pay the claim of certain un
dertakers of Los Angeles, who ask $182 50
for the embalming and shipping of the
body of Lieutenant Hartly R. Hodgson,

sembly to-night, with only the votes of
the "push" against it. Mr. Atherton's bill
has pursued somewhat a tortuous legis
lative course. It was first introduced as
Assembly bill 448 and referred to the Com
mittee on Public Morals. The committee
got two pleasant junkets to San Francisco
on the strength of it and then recommend
ed its passage without amendment. There
has been no hard light made against it by
the race track people, but the poolsellers
have wielded their hammers without mer
cy. The bill provides that pools on races
of any kind shall be sold only in the en
closures where races are held, and makes
violation of the law a felony.

EVIDENCE OF SUICIDE.
WOODLAND, March There is a mys
tery surrounding - Miss Philippine Kotto
man's death that even the verdict of the
Coroner's jury cannot clear away. The
account of the finding of her body in a
well on the farm of her stepfather, Fred
erick Hermann, five miles southwest of
Blacks, has been published in The Call.
Coroner Bean and Deputy Coroner Apper
son left for the Hermann farm yesterday
afternoon and held an inquest. After
hearing all the testimony the jury found
a verdict to the effect that the young
lady was 2S years of age and a native of
Missouri, and that she came to her death
by drowning in a well, but whether as a
result of accident or intent could not be
determined. " ________
A short time previous to the drowning
of the young woman, who had always
been of a cheerful disposition, she had a
spell of despondency, and this leads to
the conclusion that she committed sui
cide by jumping into the well.

Beef Inquiry.
CROSS-EXAMINES WITNESSES
COMMANDING GENERAL WANTS
TO BRING OUT ALL FACTS.
Testimony of Colonel Woodruff Con
cerning Supplies in Indian Cam
paigns Is Declared
Incorrect.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 3.â The latest
developments of the War Department
Court of Inquiry into General Miles'
beef charges was the appearance to
day of Major Jesse Lee as counsel for
the general commanding the army. Ma
jor Lee was so introduced to the court
by the recorder, Colonel Davis, at the
beginning of the afternoon session. He
began to cross-examine witnesses at
once, and with the first one antagonized
the court to the extent of demanding
the admission of certain letters as
evidence, but was refused. The pro
ceedings were not marked, however,
by any unpleasant friction between the
court and the new counsel.
The appearance of Major Lee ln the
case is the culmination of considerable
I correspondence between General Miles
and the court as to the accuracy of
some statements made by witnesses on
the stand and which General Miles con
sidered he had official data to prove
incorrect. It began with the testimony
of Colonel "Woodruff several days ago
that beef herds were seldom, if ever,
driven with troops in the Indian cam
paigns of the West.
General Miles called the attention of
the court to this case, and was in
formed by letter that If he chose it was
within his rights to be present or to
be represented by counsel to keep track
of the examination. V.
General Miles replied that it was
sometimes the custom in courts of In
-1 quiry to have present an officer to as
i sist "the recorder in keeping the records
I in shape.
The court replied to this that It did
j not need any "assistance" for its re
â¢ corder, but suggested again that Gen
j eral Miles could be present to aid in the
| examination of witnesses or could be
represented by counsel if he wished.
To this General Miles replied to-day j
that in accordance with custom in such
cases he would be represented here
after by Major Jesse Lee, "for the
purpose of participating in the exami
nation with a view to eliciting the full
truth pertaining to the subject under
discussion." This does not place Gen
eral Miles in the position of defendant
before the court, but gives his coun
sel the right of conducting a cross- j
examination as full as he desires.
WHY HAGGIN'S FILLIES
ARE DENIED REGISTRY
English Breeders Devise a Method of
Preventing American
Competition.
NEW YORK, March 3.â The news from !
London that the entire consignment of j
yearlings sent to England by J. B. Hag- 1
gin and sold there had been refused reg- I
istry in the Stud Book has aroused !
much feeling in turf circles. The send- j
j ing of the fillies to England by Mr. Hag- j
gin was in answer to a demand which
has lately arisen among English breeders ;
for some new blood to infuse into their
lines, and there was a natural turning to i
America for It In the shape of native !
bred fillies. So numerous were the in- â 
quiries that Mr. Haggin, with character- I
istic Yankee alertness, sent the fillies to j
i England instead of waiting for English
j men to come after them.
But the master of Rancho del Paso ,
! made one mistake he sent too many at
i once. The best breeders in England were :
. attracted to his sale, and the fillies
' brought such prices that Mr. Haggin de
termined to sell in England every year. :
! His success attracted other Americans. i
i All over the country men were looking
over their stock with a view to a possible ;
English market. Much of all this was ,
spoken of In the newspapers, both on |
this side and the other, and the English- j
man suddenly realized he was inviting a j
flood of foreign blood into his pedigrees
and that these same Americans would
come into competition with the home
breeder on the Englishman's own land.
It was this realization which stirred up
the breeders over there, and they have
been writing about it. talking about it
i and conceived a scheme to stop it. An
! intimation was sent to this country some
time ago. Mr. Haggin was told that his
I future shipment of fillies would not
i profit him. The Stud Book was not men
! tioned as a weapon of defense, but It was
generally understood weeks ago that
youngsters going to England here- j
I after would not be welcomed. It was
expected the English method would be
1 to question the pedigrees to the minutest
detail and throw out all that were not
clearer than a diamond, thus discouraging
Americans by their harassing exactness.

live to a green old age like the great states-

a little daily thought and regard for health.
If, when a man feels that he is a little out
of sorts, he will resort to the right remedy,
1 he will never have to submit to the more
serious ills of life. Most men, when they

day and are restless during the night, and
find their appetite falling off, pay little or
no heed to these warnings. The inevitable
result is some dangerous and possibly fatal
malady. The doctor may call it consump-
tion, malaria or biliousness, or perhaps
some blood or skin disease. It makes but
little difference. These troubles all have
their inception in the same cause â im-

LAST DAY OF CONGRESS
MUCH CONFUSION
IN THE SENATE
Rush to Dispose of the
Pending Bills.
CONFEREES ARE KEPT BUSY
ARMY APPROPRIATION MEAS
URE FINALLY PASSED.
But the Greatest Difficulty Is En
countered in the Consideration of
the River and Harbor
. ~~- Bill.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 4.â At
3 o'clock the conferees agreed to
report another disagreement on
the armor plate and the battle
ship amendments of the Senate
In the naval bill. They agreed on
all the other provisions. Those
two Items will be submitted to
a vote of the Senate.
The conferees on the river and
harbor bill are unable to make
any change in the bill and it will
be report! d back to the Senate as
it was first agreed upon.
WASHINGTON, March Excite
ment, confusion, heavy strain and hard
work have characterized this, the last
legislative day of the Fifty-fifth Con
gress in the Senate. At times the con
fusion was so great in this usually
staid and decorus body as to render
the transaction of business almost im
possible.
Toward midnight order was being
evolved from the seeming chaos of the
early part of the day and evening and
the prospect was fair that Congress
would adjourn at noon to-morrow with
Its absolutely necessary work com
pleted.
When the Senate convened at 11
o'clock this morning it faced the task
of considering two of the great ap
propriation bills, those Tor the army
and for supplying the general defi
ciency. The former carried appropria
tions exceeding $50,000,000 and the lat
ter about $20,000,000. With a deter
mination to complete the appropriation
bills the Senate began immediately at
11 o'clock to consider the measures, and
at 8 o'clock to-night the army bill was
passed, the deficiency bill having
passed nearly three hours before. A
conference report on the Alaska crim
inal code bill was presented and agreed
to.
A partial report on the sundry civil
appropriation bill was agreed to. but
the inability of the Senate conferees
to secure an agreement on the Ha
waiian cable proposition created a
heated discussion, in the course of
which Speaker Reed was alluded to in
uncomplimentary terms.
To-night when the river and harbor
conference report was presented, a
debate upon the recession of the Sen
ate conferees from the Senate amend
ment providing for reservoirs to irri
gate arid lands at the headwaters of
the Missouri River was precipitated by
the advocates of the proposition. An
effort was made to recommit the bill
to the conferees, but "it failed after an
impassioned speech by Senator Frye,
who submitted the report.
When the Senate convened on its last
legislative session at 11 o'clock more than
the usual number of Senators were on the
floor. Morning business was suspended
practically, and the Senators proceeded
immediately to business looking to ad
journment. The following bills were
passed: To Incorporate the National
White Cross of America and for other
purposes; amending the internal revenue
laws relating to distilled spirits and for
other purposes; authorizing the construc
tion of a bridge over the Tennessee River
at Sheffield, Ala.; authorizing the Wash
ington and Gettysburg Railroad Company
of Maryland to extend its line of road
into the District of Columbia; a bill pro
viding a site for the Washington Public
Library building. â¦
Temporarily, the general deficiency bill
was laid aside, and Allison presented a
partial conference report on the sundry
civil bill. He said there were still
twenty-two items in disagreement. The
Senate amendment which made appro
priations for a large number of public
buildings had been held up by the House
conferees, who insisted that it should con
tain provisions only . for buildings, the
bills for which had passed both the House
and the Senate. ,- . . ~ .â¢< <
One of the important amendments
which the House conferees had declined
to accept was that providing for a Pa
cific cable. As the amendment was agreed
to practically unanimously by the Sen
ate, Allison said the Senate conferees de
cided to refer the matter back to the Sen-
Frye of Maine, chairman of the Com
mittee on Commerce, presented the final
conference report on the river' and har
bor bill. He consented to withhold it in
order that consideration of the general
deficiency bill might be proceeded with.
Hale offered an amendment appropriat
ing $3,000,000 as an emergency fund to be
expended by the President at his discre
tion. The amendment was accepted with
out debate or explanation.
Among the amendments agreed, to were
these: Authorizing' the Secretary of the
Interior to establish at Omaha a ware
house for Indian supplies; the amendment
to carry Into effect existing laws pro
viding two months' extra pay for the vol
unteer officers and volunteer enlisted men
of the navy who served beyond the United
States in "the war with Spain, and one
month's extra pay for similar officers and
men who served during that war only in
the United States.
Consideration of the army appropriation
bill was then begun. The few amend
ments of the Senate committee to the bill
were agreed to as the reading of the
measure proceeded. -"".__ â 
The bill as amended was then passed
without division. '-". '>
At 3:20 a. m. Frye reported no further
agreement could be reached, the House
conferees declining to reopen the river
and harbor agreement already reached.
Warren said he was satisfied that the
conferees had done all they could and
rather than imperil the great appropria
tion bills he would yield the point.
The report was then agreed to without
division. Â _ Tr
The conference report on the \\ ashing*
ton public library bill was agreed to.
A partial report of the conference on
the naval appropriation bill was pre
sented by Hale. He explained that the
Senate's armor plate amendment was the
serious stumoling block, and it had been
suggested that the Senate take a vote
upon the proposition as it now was pre
sented. He declared the situation very
serious, as it would affect the price of
armor not only for the ships authorized
by this bill, but for the ships already
'contracted for. /.â¢-*..â¢

Â© WASHI.TOTON, March 3.â Representative Bailey of Texas an- O

FORTUNE PICKED
UP IN AN ALLEY
Half - Million in Bonds
and Stocks.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. March's.â Mining stocks,
bonds and other papers supposed to be
valued in the aggregate at $400,000 to
$500,000 were found this evening in an
alley in the rear of 22 and 2-4 Custom
House place. The papers are believed
to be the property of J. M. Sigafus,
manager of the Good Hope Mining
Company, whose office is in Ferris,
Riverside County, California. Police
men spent the night in a search for
Sigafus, but they were unable to find
any trace of him. The police have as
yet been unable to determine whether
the bonds are worthless and were
thrown away, or whether Sigafus was
robbed and foully dealt with. One cir
cumstance which combats the theory
that the bonds were thrown away is
that when they were found they were
wrapped in a soiled shirt. Near the
papers was a red leather pocketbook,
two note books and a pamphlet on ci
pher messages.
The bonds were in various mines in
Riverside County. There was a mort
gage on a piece of property at 22
Ninety-sixth street, New York, for
$100,000, dated February 26, 1898, and
papers showing huge dealings with a
gold and silver smelting works at Los
Angeles Cal. Besides these there were
deeds to the Red Jacket and Ophir
mines in California. Among the papers
there was also a letter from the Los
Angeles smelting concern addressed to
Sigafus. The same name was also in
one of the books found.
A small diary was also found in the
package. The last entry was made on
February 26 at Louisville, Ky., and
from the fact that on every day before
that he faithfully kept the private rec
ord, the police argue that the book
must have left his possession on or just
after that date.
The memoranda of the preceding day
shows that Sigafus was in Louisville
and that it was his intention to remain
there two or three days. The last
entry read as follows:
"Am now stopping at the Broadway
House. Met Johnson to-day by ap
pointment." : .*._ .
LOUISVILLE, Ky., March 3.â James
A. Sigafus was at the Broadway Hotel
five days ago from California. What
his business in Louisville was, if any,
is not known, as he told no one. Thurs
day morning he paid his bill and left,

PLOT OF CONVICTS TO
MURDER SAN QUENTIN
GUARDS AND ESCAPE
Continued from First Page.
Merritt, two miles north of Camp Tay
lor, after a running fight.
When the Warden learned the des
perate character of the men with whom
he had to deal and the fact that they
possessed revolvers, knives and plenty
of ammunition, he summoned Captains
Birlem and Edgar and held a consulta
tion. As Cooper was supposed by the
conspirators to be * â¢ of them, and
in a position to lean, /hen the break
for liberty was to be made, it was
finally decided to wait until a chance
presented itself to seize the weapons.
Yesterday afternoon Cooper informed
Warden Hale that Schlegal was to liber
ate himself from his cell at midnight
with a key of his own improvising,
"silence" Sergeant E. V. Ellis of the
first night watch, and secure the keys
to free the others. Then the weapons
were to be brought from their hiding
place and the guards to be over
poweredâwhich, in reality, meant that
murder was to be committed.
Last evening the prisoners were
locked up as usual, but at 9:30 o'clock
the two captains, with nine guards,
took the eight men from their cells and
placed them in solitary confinement in
the dungeon. They were all surprised
and evidently deeply chagrined at the
turn in affairs, but' went sullenly to
their punishment and none made pro
test.
Early this morning fifteen guards
were set at work searching the jute
mill, the carpenter-shop, the old fac
tory building and the hundred other
places where the weapons might have
been hidden. At dusk the search was
abandoned until to-morrow morning.
In Schlegal's cell a hatchet was found
concealed under the mattress of the
bed, and a crudely made key to his
cell door under the pillow. Three partly

| finished knives, made out of files, were
i found in the carpenter-shop. Not a
revolver was discovered, but Warden
Hale declares there is positive evidence
they were smuggled in, and will con
tinue the search until all the weapons
are found.
This morning Shields was summoned
to Warden Hale's office and discharged
from further service. While the head
of the prison admits that Cooper said
Shields was implicated In the conspir
acy, he says the guard was not dis
charged for that reason, but for a
"breach of discipline." This is the
stock excuse usually given when the
officials desire to keep anything secret,
but other admissions make plain what
the Warden discharged the guard for.
"Cooper said Shields was implicat
ed," said Hale, "but we are always
chary about believing the tale of a
convict concerning a free man. I wish
it understood that I myself do not
charge Shields with being in the plan,
but I thought I had good reason to
drop him. I told him that if I were
doing him an injustice he could bring
his case up before the Board of Prison
Directors at its meeting a week from
to-morrow and have a full and impar
tial investigation."
For weeks prior to the detection of
the plan of the prisoners to escape a
number of them had acted in a surly
manner when going about their duties,
and, while not directly disobeying or
ders, had behaved in a way showing
them to be on the edge of revolt. One
of the results of this was seen In the
following significant notice posted in
the office of Captain Birlem on Febru
ary 27; :â  .-.-
After March 1, 1599, no excuse whatever
will be accepted from any employe found
asleep while on duty, and his discharge
will promptly follow.
W. E. HALE, Warden.
Under the direction of Captain Blr
lem the walls were double-manned to
night and extra guards have been sta
tioned about the yard and on the out
side, all being armed with rifles or shot
guns. It is believed other prisoners
were mixed in the affair without the
knowledge of Convict Cooper, and that
the threatened insurrection was. if
anything, more serious than at first an
ticipated. All the malefactors will be
kept in solitary confinement until the
Prison Directors finally dispose of their
cases, and the search for weapons will
be resumed at dawn to-moro%v.

men succeeded in cutting their way
through the cavalry lines and escaped.
A series of battles took place before
the rebels captured Kuyang, in which
3500 rebels were killed. This did not
seem to diminish their numbers, for
owing to the famine and high taxes
large numbers are, joining their ranks
in all five disaffected provinces. In the
last battle before the walls of Kuyang
the local militia barely waited for the
approach the rebels, when they threw
down their arms and scampered inside
the city's gates. The only real fighting
done here by the imperial troops was
that of the Lungshan battalion, which
lost over 200 in killed and wounded, be
sides its commanding officers. The Gov
ernors of the provinces affected are
hurrying forward all the troops at
their command. Little is accomplished,
however, because their various generals
refuse to combine their forces, each
wanting another to make the. forward
movement against the enemy. The
rebels are now too strong to be at
tacked by any one general singly, and
unless some high official is sent to take
supreme command it is apparent the
imperial troops will continue to be de
feated.

TRAGEDY AT TACOMA.

Many Members Clamor
for Recognition.
LIVELY TIMES ON THE FLOOR
FAILURE TO AGREE ON THE
CONFERENCE REPORT.
Insistence Upon Disagreement to Im

dry Bill Causes Sessions
During the Night.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 3.â Crowded
galleries looked down upon the strug
gling members of the House to-day as
the closing scenes of the last legisla
tive day of this Congress were being
enacted. Step by step the leaders in
charge of the appropriation bills
pushed them through the final stages,
and during every lull in the consider
ation of the conference reports, mem
bers clamored for recognition for be
lated local bills in the vain hone of
rescuing them from death on the calen
dar.
At times the House was like bedlam.
Pound as the Speaker would with his
gavel, It was almost impossible to pre
serve order, and to the casual visitor
in the gallery, the proceeding on the
floor must have been about as Intelli
gible as an exciting day ln the wheat
pit would be to a parish priest. The
noise and confusion on the floor, punc
tuated with the constant banging of
the Speaker's gavel or the droning
voice of the clerk; irate members' fac
ing each other and talking at the
same time; pages scurrying up and
down the aislesâ all this was utterly
distracting. But the people in the gal
leries stayed and there were a dozen
persons in line in the corridors wait
ing for every vacant seat, so great ls
the attraction of a dying Congress.
Walker of Massachusetts, after many
unsuccessful attempts, got an opportun
ity during the afternoon to voice his
views on currency reform, and severe
ly criticized some of his Republican
colleagues. When "the great beacon
light on the dome of the Capitol blazed
forth as darkness fell, thousands upon
thousands were attracted to the bril
liantly illuminated wings of the Capi
tol where the two houses were to sit
out the night. In the reserved galleries
of the House were congregated the
elite of the society of the national capi
tal, while the public galleries were
banked to the doors. Stylishly gowned
ladies, and men in evening dress add
ed eclat to the occasion.
The big questions in dispute between
the two houses being naturally the last
to be adjusted, were postponed far into
the night. From time to time short
recesses were taken. These were sim
ply breathing spells, however, and soon
the leaders were at it harder than
ever.
At 11 o'clock the House entered upon the
last legislative day of the session.
When Walker, chairman of the Commit
tee on Banking and Currency, took the
floor under the privilege granted him
earlier in the day, he made a statement,
largely personal, showing the efforts he
had made during a long series of years
to secure monetary legislation. In this
connection he answered published criti
cisms of his course and went into an elab
orate explanation of the long fight in his
committee which resulted in the report of
a bill and its subsequent withdrawal.
His colleague. Barrett (H.) of Massa
chusetts, demanded an opportunity to re
ply, claiming that Walker had agreed to
yield him time. This Walker denied, say
ing he always kept his promises to God
and man, but "not according to the stand
ards of his colleagues."
Barrett denounced the denial as an un
mitigated falsehood."
Walker proceeded to criticize the cur
rency committee selected by Grosvenor,
chairman of the Republican caucus. Walk
er spoke in high terms of H. H. Hanna
of the Indianapolis monetary committee,
but denounced the manner in which he

SAGASTA`S RULE
AT MADRID ENDS
Queen Regent Requests Silvela
to Form a Conservative
Cabinet.
MADRID, March 3.â The Queen Regent, as the result of her con
sultations with the statesmen and political leaders, to-day Informed Sa
gasta that she desired to retain the present Chamber, and then she In
vited him to reconstruct the Cabinet.
Senor Sagas replied that it would be impossible for him to remain
Premier without a dissolution. Thereupon the Queen Regent referred
the same request to Senor Montero Rios, who declined for the same
reason.
Finally Senor Silvela, the Conservative leader, accepted the task, and
it is expected he will submit a Conservative Ministry to her Majesty for
her approval. The newspapers predict that popular demonstrations will
greet a Conservative Ministry.
In the Silvela Cabinet, it is believed, Marquis Pidal, former Vice
President of the Chamber of Deputies, will hold the portfolio of Foreign
Affairs; Lieutenant General Polavieja, who has held the post of Gov
ernor General of Cuba and the Philippines, the portfolio of War, and
Senor Date the portfolio of the Interior. .
The Cortes will be dissolved, the new elections taking place toward
the end of April and the new Chamber of Deputies meeting in May. Count
de Rascon, Spanish Embassador to Great Britain, and Leon y Castillo,

SAT UPON BY
ARGO`S GHOST
A Prisoner Vindicates
Ex-Sheriff Harrison.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, March Augustine
Valencia is a chicken thief, and, in ac
cordance with the ethics of his "pro
fession," not a very courageous man,
but if there is one thing on earth he
dreads more than another it is the so
called specter that is supposed to flit
about the "ghost cell" of the County
Jail. Valencia says ex- Sheriff Harrison
might have played spook once, as
claimed by Peter Nelson, but if he did
he infringed on the domain of the
that that is not material, the !
realm of Argo's ghost. The prisoner
had a visitation last night that caused
him to alarm the other inmates of the
jail and grovel in terror even after he
was placed ln another cell.
Valencia formerly was quartered
with Victor Colwell, but when the
young highwayman sawed the bars of
his cell through Valencia was re
moved and at his own request placed in
the "ghost cell." He laughed at the
idea of a spook, and for a month de
fled the tradition of the Weary Wil
liams of the road.
Shortly after 1 o'clock -this morning
two ex-convicts named Smith and Mc-
Carthy were awakened by yells and
groans in Valencia's cell. In a minute
all was quiet, and then came more
howls and shrieks and prayers.
They called- Jailer Atchley, who went
into Valencia's cell and found him
doubled up on his cot, his face pale
and distorted with fright, and his chin
flecked with blood trickling from the
end of his tongue, which he had bitten
in a paroxysm of terror. He could not
speak when removed -from the "ghost
cell," and tried to force his way !
through an outer door into the corridor. j
He was placed/ in a corner cell, but j
paced restlessly up and down all night
without sleep.
"I was smoking a cigarette," he told
Sheriff Taylor to-day, "and could not
possibly have suffered a nightmare. I
could not see that ghost, hut it came
and lay full length upon me. I felt it
with my hands, and every time I threw
it off it got back. When I tried to get off
the bed it lifted the outer edge up and
threw me against the wall. Then it sat I
on my shoulders. I pinched myself to ,
make sure I was not dreaming, and
when the pinching hurt I was so scared
I couldn't have helped screaming to
save my life."
Out of mischief Taylor told Valencia
this afternoon he would have to go
back into the "spook's cell" again. Al
most in tears the prisoner begged to be
kept in another cell, and when his re
quest was granted he grasped the Sher
iff's hand and clung to it in expression
of his gratitude. "

WASHINGTON, March 3. â President
McKinley will go to the Capitol at 10
o'clock to-morrow morning and remain
there during the closing hours of Con

Only One Bulletin.
NEW YORK, March Rudy ard Kip

condition is satisfactory in one way, and
but one bulletin was issued to-dayâ at
2:55 o'clockâ which was as follows:
"Mr. Kipling has continued to improve,
so that to-day his temperature and pulse
are but little above normal."
Notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Kip
ling is extremely weak and that absolute
rest and quiet have been enjoined by his
physicians, the English author's nature is
such that even in his present condition
he is permitted to entertain himself with
a newspaper now and then.
To-night Dr. Dunham, who is still in

ACCUSES ATTORNEY
BOWDEN OF THEFT
SAN JOSE. March 3.â 11 l feeling exists"
between Attorneys William A. Bowden
and John H. Yoell, and friends Of both
men fear a clash between them that
might result in personal injury. This
feeling was further increased to-day
when Attorney Yoell filed his answer to
a suit brought against him by P. W.
Dougherty to recover $1098 due on a prom
issory note. Dougherty borrowed this
money from Louise Masson, and it was
set forth that he had paid Yoell the
money and Yoell had appropriated it to
his own use. Dougherty was obliged to
pay it over again. Bowden is Dough
erty s attorney. In the complaint Bow
den accused Yoell of embezzlement.
To-day Yoell evened matters in his an
swer by calling Bowden a thief, declaring
Bowden had been jailed for stealing
money from his (Yoell's) father, but had
begged so plteously he was released.
Bowden also is accused of having stolen
records from the Courthouse, and Yoell
says that so notorious is this fact that
when parts of records are missed they
are referred to as being "Bowdenized."
_oell since the suit was begun has paid
Dougherty $1000. He admits owing him
$98 more and asks that judgment be given
against him for that sum.
AGREEMENT REACHED
ON NICARAGUA CANAL
WASHINGTON, March 3.â The confer
ence report on the river and harbor Dili
contains two Oregon items over which
there has been dispute, but which have
been modified. The Yaquina Bay item
is fixed so as to have the project exam-
Ined by a board of engineers. The appro
priation for the proposed improvement of
the Columbia River and the provision fur
the construction of a boat railway ia
stricken out, but the law for the project
is not repealed. * â¢ â  , . Â
The conferees on the sundry civil Mil
disagreed on the items appropriating JbOO
for a telephone line to Table Bluff light
house, California, and $15,000 for the Bur
rows Island light station, Washington. A
further conference, however, win be ha.
on these items. ,____. ._
Senator White said to-night that the
Nicaragua canal agreement reached by
the conferees was not satisfactory to him,
but was the best that could be obtained.
Senator Morgan, special champion or the
canal, had counseled an agreement on
$1,000,000 appropriation for surveys of Pan
ama and Nicaragua routes, and the con
ferees of the Senate yielded to the House
on this point.
WANTS A MONOPOLY
ON OIL PRODUCTION
SANTA BARBARA, March There
was filed this afternoon with the County
Clerk a complaint for an injunction which
on its face seems to be an attempt to set
tle the question which has agitated Sum
merland at various times since IS9O.
Grant Dewlaney, who Is an employe of
J. B. Treadwell, the Southern Pacific
agent at Summerland, and owns some oil
lands there, is the plaintiff, and about
twelve oil producers of Summerland the
defendants.
The injunction is asked for to prevent
these defendants boring for oil on certain
park lands which were recently leased to
them by the Trustees of the town. These
park lands He directly behind Tr.eadwell'a
and the Southern Pacific's property,
which Is covered with oil derricks, and
this company fears that should these prtÂ«
vate owners be allowed to go on with oil
well boring on the parks the supply of
their own wells will be materially de
creased. In asking for the injunction
they declare that If the parks could be
leased the streets could also, and they
claim that as the Trustees are virtually
accountable to no one they can and will
lease the streets for these purposes. This
suit for an injunction is virtually only a
means of attempting to keep oil producers
away from the Southern Pacific's oil ter
ritory.

NAME THEIR MINE
THE DAISY BELLE
Fortunes in Sight for
Shasta Men.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, March ...âAdditional de
rails of the remarkable gold strike at
Furnaeeville prove that the discovery
Is not merely a pocket, but a well de
fined small ledge with an extremely
â¢ii-n ribbon pay streak running through
t. The lucky prospectors traced the
edge along the surface for 100 feet from
me point whence the bulk of the treas
ire was taken. They covered all traces
)f their work, with the exception of the
>pen cut, hastened to Redding, had
*3757 in dust melted into a bar at the
Redding sampling works, shipped it to
'.he. San Francisco Mint, perfected the
ocation of their claim in the Recorder's
.ffice and returned the foil,. wing day to
.heir mine.
W. M. Dale, J. H. Moore and William
silent are the names of the discoverers.
Dale lias been dividing his time be
tween mining on North Cow Creek and
'arming on Oak Run. He has had sev
eral associates. Two years ago and
igain last year he took out considerable
â¢urns in coarse gold and nuggets from
.he bed of the creek. When in Red
ling to sell his gold he said that al
hough he was not an experienced pros
pector he believed there was a ledge
near by. He had made some efforts to
ocate it, but gave up the search and
contented himself with the pickings
!rom the creek, which were far beyond
.he profits of farming.
It is said that either Moore or Silent,
>r both, are experienced prospectors
md when the water got low in the
â¢reek and they were forced to turn their
ittention to ledge prospecting they
vere not long in locating at least one
prolific source of the stream gold.
The discovery is three-quarters of a
mile northwest of the smelters of the
old Afterthought mine, on the Reid toll
â¢pad, and about a half-mile distant
'rom North Cow Creek. In the Record
er's office the name of the mine appears
is the Daisy Belle.
When exhibiting a beautiful $83 speci
men to his friends here Dale said he
md his partners had at least $2000 in
sight without attempting to approxi
mate what the mine might yield. With
vhat had been taken out and what was
eft in sight the miners felt certain in
counting on at least $6000 for a little
jver a week's work.
There will hardly be a rush to the
iistrict by Shasta County prospectors,
.ecause they know that until next win
der there will not be sufficient water to
T-rospect effectively. Should outsiders
'â¢me in they will likely meet disap
pointment, for the same reason which
leters men familiar with the territory
rom flocking to the district. The lo
cality is heavily mineralized, a large
.old-bearing copper deposit lying
icross the creek and about a mile from
:he Daisy Belle mine.
CAN DO WITHOUT RAIN.
WOODLAND. March 3.â The uncer
:alnty of the rainfall for the past two or
hree seasons has emphasized the neces
sity of the utilization of all the resources
tor irrigation at hand. Farmers and fruit
growers along Cache Creek and within the
listrict covered by the Moore ditch are
beginning to realize that there is no r.-a
ion why they should remain in a corral
lon which makes them wholly dependent
-non the elements for a crop.
The Moore ditch, if put in proper con
dition. is capable of irrigating a very
arise area of fruit, wheat and alfalfa .and
>n the south side of the creek. There are
>ther facilities for artificial irrigation, all
>'{ which are likely to be put into use. A
ew small pumping plants were put in
ast season. In most cases Cache reek

ILL-FATED NOMAD
WAS IN COLLISION
Cause of the Schooner's
Destruction.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
j VICTORIA, B. C, March Accord
| ing- to a letter received by a Victoria
i shipping firm from its Honolulu agents,
Hawaiian shipping men, besides finding
; the name plate of the ill-fated schooner
Nomad, have found on the wreck evi
dences of her having been in collision.
A number of Victoria shipping men are
advancing the theory that the vessel
which gave the wrecked Nomad her
death blow was in all probability the
long-missing steamer Pelican, which
left Tacoma on October 12, 1897, and is
about eighteen months overdue. The
Pelican was, of course, long overdue
when the Nomad left Shanghai on her
return voyage to the Sound, but ship
ping men hold that there is good reason
to believe it was her derelict, floating
about buoyed up by the lumber cargo,
that proved the Nomad's death snag.
Others put forward the belief that the
Nomad may have collided with the
Celtic Bard or the Carradoc, sailing
vessels long overdue from the Orient
for this port and now posted as missing.
Unless the wreckage found some time
ago along the uninhabited shores of
Vancouver Island or that found on the
west coast of Queen Charlotte's can be
connected with the wreck of these ves
sels, nothing has ever been heard of
the two big sailing vessels since they
left the Orient.
A report has reached here from Yo
kohama of the finding of some wreck
age and railroad lumber and ties in the
China seas by the British bark Collen
grove on January 3 last, and it is gen
erally believed here that this flotsam
was from the missing Pelican. Dodwell
& Co., her agents, say they have ad
vices which lead them to accept this
belief, but they decline to enter into
details. They point to the fact in con
firmation of their belief that all vessels
carrying railroad lumber which have
left Puget Sound during the past
eighteen months have been accounted j
for.
Many shipping men hold that the
wreckage found was not from the Peli
can. Captain Roos of the schooner
Eric is one of these. He says the
wreckage found by the Collengrove is
in all probability from some Japanese
schooner, a number of which are now
engaged in carrying railroad lumber to
Taku and North China.
BICYCLISTS COLLIDE
AND ONE IS KILLED
David Arata Loses His Life on a
Boad Near Mountain
View.
PALO ALTO, March 3.â a result of
a bicycle collision which occurred at Oak'
Grove at 11 o'clock last night David Arata
lies dead at his parents' home near Moun
tain View, and Dan Murphy of Mayfield
is suffering from internal injuries and a
broken wrist.
The men, thinking the road clear, were
j going at full speed. According to Mur-
p hy, they were covering at least twenty
j miles an hour. The night was extreme
!ly dark, and apparently neither rider
knew of the other's presence until the col
lision. It is thought Arata was killed in
stantly by striking his head against Mur
phy's handlebars. Murphy crawled to a
neighbor's house near by and obtained as
sistance.
The dead man seems to have been fated
j last night. He had hardly got beyond
Mayfield, where he had been spending the
evening, when he came within an ace of
I colliding with three bicyclists on their
( way to Palo Alto. He was going at high
i speed and passed between two of them,
! grazing one of the wheels. Five minutes
â¢ later he met Murphy. He was 24 years
| of age and was reared near Mountain
I View.
Both men have local fame as bicyclists
I and often competed in meets in San
Jose. v*.

ATTEMPT TO SEIZE

A Short Revolution in
Costa Rica.

BLOODSHED AT SAN JOSE
MARTIAL LAW HAS THEREFORE
BEEN PROCLAIMED.
Fifty Armed Men Dash Into the Ar
tillery Barracks and the Fight
ing Is Fierce and
Deadly.
I Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, . 1899. by James Gor
don Bennett.
PANAMA, March, 3. A serious at
) tempt to overturn the Government was
made in San Jose, the capital of Costa
Rica, on February 25, resulting in the
shedding of much blood and , great
alarm by the public.
The constitution has been suspended
and martial law proclaimed. A rigor
i ous censorship was instituted directly
i after the outbreak, and details are dif-
I ficult to secure.
The Herald's correspondent at San
Jose writes via Limon (he not being
I permitted to cable) to the effect that
the revolutionary movement broke out
, on the morning of February 25. caus
! ing great alarm in the caDital.
About fifty men armed with revol
vers and knives made an attack on the
i artillery barracks. General Velarde.
Louis Soto and Senor Quesada. a law
yer, were the leading men. A young
lieutenant was at the door with a
: guard named Frederico J. Velarde, son
of General Velarde, who was evidently
i bought by the revolutionists. He
threw the door of the barracks open to
j the invading mob, who, In entering,
i were attacked by the local troops in-
I side. A brisk firing was kept up for
! half an hour, but on the arrival of a
j detachment of police the assailants
j were dispersed. Some were wounded
i and many arrests were made.
In an hour order was restored, and
! by evening there was complete auiet
i and business was resumed. Casualties
are as follows. The following were
I killed:
COLONEL JUAN ARROYO, com
i mander of the barracks.
COLONEL SOTERO AUTILLON.
: corporal of the guard. "â¢
LIEUTENANT VELARDE and sev
! eral soldiers and policemen.
A few private citizens were wounded.
Lieutenant Velarde killed Colonel
! Autillon. while one of the soldiers of
i the guard killed Lieutenant Velarde.
A brother of Lieutenant Velardp was
severely wounded.
The principal leader. General Vel
arde, escaped arfd is still uncaptured.
The Government does not think the
'â  disorder will in any way affect or has

THE MULES STAMPEDED.
Three Hundred of Uncle Sam's Song
Birds Go on a Midnight Backet.
"The mules came back"â that is to say,
j they were enticed to return home by the
; combined efforts of the city police force,
â  two troops of cavalry and Major Thomp
son. A few days ago Major Thompson
received from St. Louis 300 mules destined
for transportation to the Philippines on
the ship Conemaugh. Uncle Sam re
quested him to take the tourists out to
the Presidio and care for them there un
til they should take passage for tho Or
ient. When they arrived on the reser
vation the mules were quartered In the
unfinished corral.
Everything went along nicely until a
little after midnight. The mules were
to all appearances asleep and dead to the
world. Suddenly there was a commotion
in one of the corrals and the next thing
the guards knew the mules had kicked
off two panels of the fencing and were
stampeding over the reservation. Major
: Thompson was suddenly awakened. He
pulled on one boot, grabbed his sword
and went across the back parade like
j Aguinaldo getting away from the First
California- ; .'.â¢
WHEN JOHN PHILIP
PLAYED THE BAND
AMERICA'S greatest brass band hero,
John Philip Sousa, played in the Al
hambra last night to an audience that
would have done Melba honor. The
flower, fashion and culture of the com
munity were squeezed into the last avail
able Inch of sardine f space. Women
cheered and brave men stormed with heel
and hand and the small boy whistled,
and the only John Philip and his band
played on.
There was a set programme, duly print
ed and distributed at the door, but it was
almost forgotten In the avalanche of en
cores. The applause could have been heard j
in Oakland, and the extra pieces came in
bunches of threes and fours. Nobody will
ever know just how many were played,
and Mr. Sousa had poses and gestures to
lit every one. ] '*:â¢â¢.' â¢ .'
Only one thing was wanting to complete
the glory of the night, and that was Mr.
Sousa's matchless collection of medals.
His chest was entirely unprotected, say.
by his uniform and a medium sized edi
tion of the American flag, worn just over
the heart. But whatever was lacking in
hardware and properties was made up for
in action. Mr. Sousa worked as you never
saw him work before. He was in perpet
ual pantomime, explaining the most In
volved passages of the music by spellbind
ing delsarte and living pictures. When he
played the tremendous scene from "Par
sifal" he illustrated it in slow, procession
al stride. The "war time" movement from
MacDowell's Indian suite he accompa

He gathered his teamsters around him
and set out in pursuit of the mules. They
had scattered to the seven corners of the
peninsula, but the major did not give up
hope. He is intimately acquainted with
the peculiarities of the army mule, so he
and his forces merely camped on the hills
for the night, and sure enough during the
morning the police, the livery â  stable
keepers and people in general from all
over the city began to telephone that they
had taken In stray herds of mules. Po
liceman Ike Tuchler captured forty of
them, but suddenly let thirty-nine of them
go. The remaining four-legged song
bird also concluded to depart and care

on the bosom of the officer's trousers.
At the present writing Tuchler is still en
deavoring to coo! off.
Some of the mules were found in Golden
Gate Park looking at the other animals.
Others were located in the different parks
in the city, where they were engaged In
mowing the lawns. One mule was cap
tured at the ferry just as he was trying
to board the boat for Oakland. They
are now corraled and are surrounded by
a strong guard.

most graceful suggestions of cake-pedes
trianism that has ever been seen on any
stage. And when he played his own
marches, those brave Sousa marches that
make soldiers of us all, there wasn't a
quiet foot nor a still shoulder in the house.
As of yore, the trombones and the cornets
marched down to the front of the stage
and blew until the electric lights flickered,
and the crowd noised for more and more.
But the great climax came at the close
of the medley of national airs when the
whole band rose to its feet and played
to the standing audience "The Star-Span

commission is intended to exercise gen

CYCLERS WILL RACE
AT THE GARDEN CITY
A TWO DAYS' MEET AND SOME
GOOD EVENTS.
McFarland and Gibson Matched for a
Ten-Mile Spin Long-Distance
Men Will Do a Hundred.
Most of the cycle racers who have been
! competing in the indoor tournament here
j recently have gone to San Jose to pre
j pare for a big race meeting to be held
! there to-day and to-morrow. An excep
! tionally fine list of events has been pre
j pared, and as the San Jose track is roomy
and conducive to great speed some good
j sport is expected. The two principal
events will be a 10-mile match to-day be
tween McFarland, the coast champion,
and Harry Gibson of Cincinnati, and a
100-mile race to-morrow between the long
distance cracks. A large number of local
wheelmen, are going down to-day by train
and wheelHo see the races.
Charles W. Miller, the six-day cham
pion, went East with his wife yesterday.
Teddy Hale and Frank Alberts, long-dis
tance men, will go to-day. The rest of the
riders will stay to take part in the San
Jose races.
The regular monthly meeting of the
California Associated Cycling Clubs will
be held this evening at 8 o'clock at room
562 Parrott building. The Kerrigan
amendment to the local rider rule will
come up for final action; also the pro
posed amendment of "Whiskers" Wood
son of Sacramento to drop club member
ships from the association entirely. The
Woodson hallucination will receive a per
emptory quietus, as have all the other
dreamy suggestions emanating from the
same source. It would mean the death of
the C. A. C. C. in no time, as the clubs
are the only means of keeping up Interest
in it, and without them its finish would be
plainly discernable. ' _ v
The fourteenth anniversay party of the
Bay City Wheelmen, postponed from Feb
ruary 8, owing to the death of one of the
members, will be held at the Palace Hotel
Maple room on Wednesday evening. April
5. The invitations issued for the first date
will be accepted on the new date, and no
more will be issued, as the limit has been
reached. _
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold a
members' meeting Thursday evening,
March 9, to be followed by an impromptu
smoker. The club will give its annual
minstrel show in the later part of April.
Captain Menne has called a club run for
Camp Taylor on March 12.
The many friends of the well-known
timer Edwin E. Stoddard, will be pleased
to learn of his recent good fortune, he
having just been appointed exclusive Pa
cific Coast agent for the Victor line.
The track recently used in the Pavilion
has been removed to the Olympic Club's
outside grounds. The Olympic Club
Wheelmen will have charge of the race
course and intend to hold a meet on it
sometime in April.
H. Austin Goddard left the other even
ing on a visit to Cleveland, Ohio, and will
be gone several weeks.
The marriage is announced of George L.
Hall, a prominent member of the Bay
City Wheelmen, and Miss Gussie Mayle
of Berkeley. The happy couple are now
receiving congratulations. _
Chairman Loos of the Road Racing
Board has set the date for the annual 25
--mile road race for Sunday. March 19. A
large entry list is expected and the usual
valuable prizes will be offered. It will be
held over the San Leandro triangle.
WRAPPED HIS HEAD
IN POISONED CLOTHS
W. ANTONrS STRANGE METHOD
OF SUICIDE.
Deliberately Took His Life by Inhal
ing the Fumes of Chloro
form.
W. Antoni, who for some time past has
been employed at the Merchants' Club,
committed suicide in a novel manner yes
terday. He saturated a quantity of cotton
with chloroform, wrapped it around his
head and bound it fast with a towel. He
then lay down on the bed and inhaled the
poisonous fumes until death ensued.
Anton! had been living in a lodging
house at 502 Mason street for the past
four years. No definite reason for his
suicide is known, but there is a little re
mance connected with his life which may
account for it. The house was formerly
leased by Mrs. 'Wells, and Anton! formed
a deep attachment for her. She resented
his advances, however, and about six
months ago gave up the house, it is said,
to rid herself of his unwelcome atten
tions. Since she left Antoni gradually
grew more despondent.
Yesterday afternoon the landlady tried
several times t oenter his room, but al
ways found the door locked on the in
side. She at last became alarmed and
called for assistance. The door was bro
ken open and Antoni was found lying on
the bed fully dressed, with his head
wrapped in the cotton.
cln the middle of a game of tennis in
Central India the other day a tiger bound
ed into the midst of the players.

LED TO DISHONOR.
THERE could have been no more fearful ar
raignment of the racetrack than appeared in this
paper yesterday morning, and this was simply a
record of fact, given without prejudice, a partial list
of those who have fallen through the temptation to
gamble offered by the races. /
Some of these people are in San Quentin. Others
have merely sunken into disgrace, but all have found
a common ruin. There are men and women and
boys on the list. There are people who have been
guilty of embezzlement, forgery, plain theft, murder.
There are those who by flight have escaped the con
sequences of their misdeeds. There are others who
. sought the peace and oblivion of the grave.
It does hot seem to us there is need of extended
comment. The truth is on record and speaks for it
self. Here are the races in almost constant opera
tion. They hold out their deadly lure day after day
and month after month, and all the time the dupes
march in steady procession to the track or the pool
room, there to wager and lose the money they can
command, whether this be their own or belonging
to an employer.
There is nothing to be said in favor of continuous
racing. It is not sport. On the contrary, it is un
clean confidence operating, in which a large part of
the gain is stained with disgrace, even with blood.
That racing should be restricted there is no ques
tion. It has grown from an amusement to a gigantic
evil. It has been wholly perverted from any good
purpose. Now it is a gambling game, with the cards
stackedâ a gold brick device, with the gilding thin.
Nevertheless it catches its prey, and these are entitled
to protection; it supports a lot of touts and vagrants
entitled to no protection, makes rich a lot of specu
lators in human gullibility, and brings many a young
man to prison, to poverty or exile.
THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES.
CECIL RHODES, the British statesman, who is
the foremost representative of British imperial
ism and has been the chief agent in extending
the African dependencies of his native country, has
volunteered apparently to advise the United States to
take up what he interprets to be "the white man's
burden." His gratuitous recommendations have the
merit of Arctic coolness and would be very refresh
ing in warm weather. In order to meet the increased
expense of revolutionizing this Government and
giving us the position of a near wheeler, attached to
the British chariot, he suggests that our pension list
be curtailed, or, in other words, that we transfer a
large part of our receipts from the American to the
British side of our policy, and make our wounded
and dead soldiers and their representatives pay the
cost of stealing Asiatic territory and enslaving
Asiatic populations. This proposition, especially
coming from Cecil Rhodes, will attract the careful
rtt.rition of our people, of their representatives in
Congress, and of the executive branch of the Govern
ment. "Why," he says, as reported, in reference to
colonization, "you are taking to it like mother's
milk, apparently with the greatest delight." It
occurs to us that this kind of "mother's milk" will
probably curdle on the American stomach, and that
the maternal breast that Great Britain has usually
presented to the lips of the barbarians she has as
sumed the right to civilize has yielded blood instead
of milk. A few more interviews such as that asso
ciated with the name of Mr. Rhodes will exercise a
most useful educational influence upon our citizens,
who have already begun to read over our constitution,
to study our national history, and to mutter American
sentiments in the cars of American annexationists.
Congressman Lewis of Washington, he of the
flowing locks and the multitudinous whiskers, lately
inserted his finger in a cigar-cutter. He now has
less finger, but he knows far more than he did.
The Illinois young woman who shot her brother-in
law because she did not like him was guilty of undue
haste. The mere fact of being disliked does not prop
erly constitute a capital offense.
, No Senator will enjoy a junketing trip to Agnews
this year, although there are several who by promis
ing to go there and stay could get the necessary trans
portation by asking for it.
The flag is no longer to be used for advertising purÂ«
poses, although wherever it is seen the world may
know that your Uncle Sam is in business at the old
stand.
THE LIGHT OF DAY.
A/1 OVED, probably, by fear of desertions, Burns
'/ \ has found it necessary to caucus his sup
porters and bind them in a pledge to. prevent
an election of Senator, if they can, unless a secret
caucus, by secret ballot, shall nominate a candidate.
In his address to his supporters Burns said: "I have
made no secret of my operations, but have invited the
light of day into everything that 1 have gone into."
That sounds well, and we hasten to assure Mr. Burns
that if he will continue to invite the light of day it
will cheerfully accept the invitation to the end. But
he attached something more than R. S. V. P. to his
invitation. It is not an unlimited offer of hospitality
to the light of day, for he added: "I am not only will
ing but anxious to go into a caucus in the good old
Republican way, and by the decision of such caucus
it will be my pleasure to abide." From this caucus
the light of day is excluded. It is a secret caucus, and
if the highly prized light of day should get in there
it is evident that Mr. Burns would hot give it the
glad hand.
It is simply a declaration and an admission that in
the open, publicly, and in the light of day, his fight
cannot be won, and that his success depends upon a
trap ready to be sprung while the light of day is
cooling its illuminated and sunsmitten heels in the
anteroom.
Nothing is more obvious than this. If he have the
strength to elect him it can be shown in the joint con
vention, in the light of day, and if his purposes are so
vestal and high it should be his pleasure to show it.
The Republican party of this State does not want a
caucus in the "good old Republican way," because
that way was in the beginning adopted to prevent
men like Burns getting to the Senate, or grasping the
other great prizes of the party offered as a reward of
merit, fitness and fidelity. Like many other good old
ways, it is a lock whose combination has been learned
by the very class of men it was intended to bar out.
Mr. Burns knows the combination and has everything
ready to use the caucus to accomplish that which it
was devised to prevent. The purpose of the caucus,
not the caucus itself, was the good old Republican
way, and in that way and purpose the party desires
to walk now. The methods it devised as means to
reward the worthy being now invoked in behalf of
the unworthy, the party abides by its set purpose
when it intermits the use of those means and seeks
others for the protection of its honor and the preser
vation of its character.
The party wants this Senatorial contest fought out
to the end in the presence of Burns' friend, the light
of day. It wants to know who is now desirous of
going into a corner in secret to cast a caucus ballot
for Burns which cannot be delivered in the" light of
day. The men who have such votes will put on the j
party a grievous responsibility and lay upon it a
heavy burden, and the party wants to know who they :
are. If their work is done in a secret caucus this can
not be known. The responsibility will be dodged by |
them and put upon other shoulders. If they are j
known the party can clean its hands by repudiating j
them. If they are unknown it has no defense against i
their act. Â«
Therefore let the light of day shine on everything !
that is done from now until the end.
BRYAN AND HIS PORTY LEADERS.
COLONEL BRYAN and his party, although
both are out of practical politics at present,
continue to be objects of interest to a consid
erable number of people. It is therefore worth
noting that there is apparently a good deal of con
fusion in the relations of the one to the other.
Judging from the reports that come to us from the
East, it is not clear whether the Democratic leaders
who are loud in proclaiming their Bryanism intend
to follow the Colonel or let him go alone.
Only a short time ago Senator James K. Jones,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
sounded the keynote of the campaign of 1900, putting
Bryan to the front and calling upon a choice galaxy
of silverites to advance the interests of the Democratic
party along the lines of the Chicago platform. There
was enough Bryanism in the note to satisfy the most
extreme partisan, and everything gave outward evi
dence of the most cordial relations between the party j
and its gifted colonel.
A further expression of the same loyalty to the j
platform and the man was made by Mr. Bailey of j
Texas, Democratic leader in the House of Repre- j
sentatives, in a speech on Washington's birthday, j
In ringing tones he declared: "As certain as the i
years go by and the great national convention re
assembles, we will set up the platform made in 1896,
and in Bryan's unsullied name will unfurl the banner
as stainless as his life, and then the great commanders
will give the orders. 'Forward march,' and it will be
a march to victory."
Such is the style of language used by the Democrats
in office when talking in public about their colonel
who is out of office. In private, however, these same
leaders are not so warm toward Bryan as to show
any large amount of steam when they meet him. A
report from Washington informs us that on his re
cent visit to the Capitol the Colonel was very coldly
received. The report says:
"There was as much difference between Mr. Bryan's
reception to-day and that of a few months ago, when
he occupied the same seat in the Marble Room and
told Democratic Senators how to vote on the peace
treaty, as there is between daylight and darkness.
Then men flocked about him like bees in a clover
field. But to-day he was unnoticed. There was not
that rush to shake his hand which was manifest some
months ago. Senators did not hurry out of the
chamber to see him and hear his advice, as they did
then. Nor did they swarm about him as though he
were a party Moses, as they once did. Not more than
five Senators saw Mr. Bryan to-day, and he was in
the Marble Room for more than an hour. Most of
this time he was seated alone, way back in a" dark
corner, while crowds of people passed by and failed
to notice him." ' \
When the practiced politicians at Washington ig
nore a former leader and do not even take the trouble
to shake hands with him we may be sure the day of
the eclipse of his leadership is near. That is why we
"say the relations between Bryan and his party are con
fused. The talk in favor of the old ticket is as strong
as ever, but since the party bosses no longer see him
when he calls, the outlook for the Colonel: is
ominou3.
Morehouse and his kind must excuse the newspaper
crowd for making remarks about them now. It isn't
a capital offense yet.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1899.
CONGRESS FAVORS EXPOSITIONS.
UNDER a suspension the rules, the House of
Representatives on Thursday voted an appro
priation pi $500,000 each for the proposed Pan-
American exposition to be held at Buffalo and the
j Oh-io centennial, to be celebrated at Toledo. The
! fact that such measures passed the House by vir
â  tually unanimous approval is a proof that the value
cf expositions is now fully understood in the East,
and that even the most economical Congressmen no
longer regard expenditures for them as either a
waste or an unwarranted use of money.
In fact, it is only upon the Pacific Coast that expo
sitions are not understood or their benefits duly ap
preciated. There has never been a really large ex
position on the coast, and our people have never had
experience of their benefits. The greatest enterprise
cf the kind ever attempted here was the Midwinter
Fair, and that was prepared hastily and was never
designed to be more than a Western exhibit of
some of the display made at the World's Fair in Chi
cago. That exposition, therefore, afforded no proper
test of what expositions accomplish when planned on
a vast scale and elaborately worked out.
As things near at home impress us more than
greater things afar off, so a large number of Pacific
Coast people judge all expositions by the results at
tained by the Midwinter Fair rather than by what has
been accomplished by the more carefully worked out
enterprises of other sections. The tendency to form
judgments in that way is natural, but it is not wise.
The more sagacious plan would be to note the results
flowing from expositions generally, and to learn from
those who have had most experience in their conduct.
In the East, where expositions on a large scale,
prepared for through years of work, are common,
public sentiment is well nigh unanimous in their fa
vor. While the Pacific Coast has never had 1 an in
ternational exposition, or even a thoroughly com
prehensive American exposition, each of the great
sections of the Eastern States has had several. Even
in the South, where there are no large cities, where
banking capital is scarce, there have been in recent
years two such expositions, while in the richer and
more populous North scarcely a year passes without
seeing the opening of some enterprise of the kind.
As a consequence of this ample experience, expo
sitions are regarded in the East as the most profitable
method of advertising that a widespread community
can devise. The experience has not been lost upon
Congress, and accordingly appropriations for such en
terprises are now made willingly and liberally, as was
shown by the action of the House on Thursday.
It is safe to say that if the State Legislature had
promptly voted the $500,000 required to assure the
Pacific Coast Exposition in California, an equal sum
would have been voted for it by Congress at the
same time the"appropriations were made for Buffalo
and Toledo.- We have lost something in point of
time by the delay of the Legislature, but a State ap
propriation now will enable us to obtain a grant from
Congress when it assembles this fall. The Legislature
should profit by the example set at Washington,
where the value of expositions is more fully under
stood than here. We can safely trust the business in
stincts of the East on subjects concerning which the
East has ample experience and we have had none.
SENATORS BY DIRECT VOTE.
TWO resolutions introduced into the Assembly
by Mr. Caminetti of Amador relative to the
election of United States Senators by! direct
vote of the people have been adopted. One of them
suggests the preparation of a memorial to the Legis
latures of the several States requesting them to pe
tition Congress to sybmit amendments to the na
tional constitution by which Senators may be elected
by the people. The other requests Congress to call a
national convention â¢ for the same purpose. Both
resolutions were adopted by a vote of 54' to 9. .
The positive character of this vote shows that the
-ame sentiment upon the Senatorial question prevails
among the legislators as among the people. When
â¢ proposition calling for an expression upon the sub
ject was submitted to the electors of this State several
years ago it received a 10 to i majority. The beg
garly minority of 13,000 out of a total of nearly
200,000 ballots indicated that there was practically no
sentiment in this State against the proposition.
The remarkable thing about the action of the As
sembly, however, consists, in the fact that the propo
sition came before one of the very houses whose pre
rogatives would be interfered with by the adoption
of the proposed change. Yet the Assembly promptly
registers the same sentiment. Of course many As
semblymen may have voted as they did believing it
to be extremely improbable that their action would
produce any effect, at least in their time; but we
have no right to assume any such condition upon the
face of the record. The fact is that fifty-four Assem
blymen out of eighty, or two-thirds of the most
popular House of the Legislature, have voted to
adopt two resolutions which, if carried into effect,
would put an end forever to Senatorial legislative
scandals.
In the Senate it is quite likely that the majority
will be as great. The Senators are older, more con
servative and more sensible. They certainly know
that the present method of electing United States
Senators is fruitful of scandal and corruption, and
undoubtedly they have long since reached the con
clusion that a change* is advisable. Nearly every re
flecting man in the country has reached this conclu
sion, and it would seem to only a question of time
when the reform must go into effect. Even . the
United States Senate, the chief beneficiary of the
present system, will agree to the change if the pres
sure becomes strong enough. . â â¢ â ?;â -. , _â

SUPERVISORS
IN A MAZE
OF FIGURES
Street Funds a Source
of Trouble.
SOME CREDITORS TO SUFFER
AUDITOR AND FINANCE COM
MITTEE DON'T AGREE.
The Latter Promises to Approve Bills
Which Mr. Wells, Upon the Ad
vice of His Attorney, Will
Not Audit.
The Finance Committee of the Supervis
ors made a determined effort yesterday to
disentangle the knot into which the funds
of the Street Department have been tied.
After a discussion that extended over
several hours the committee decided upon
the following action: The members will
approve Janury bills amounting to^ $14,
--000, and February bills to the amount of
$23,000. As against this $37,000 there are
bills outstanding to the amount of $51,000.
This leaves $14,000 of February bills un
paid.
Although the Supervisors have deter
mined upon this action, they still have
Auditor, Asa It. Wells to deal with. Act
ing upon the advice of his attorney, Mr.
Wells has decided that he will not audit
any bills for December or January until
the close of the fiscal year. At that time
there will, presumably, be a surplus in
some funds which will be available for
any purpose to which the Supervisors
may wish to apply it. He agreed to audit
Street Department bills to the extent of
$34,000 a month henceforth, as that is the
amount allowed the department under the
one-twelfth act.
Chief Deputy Donovan represented the
Street Department at the committee meet
ing. He was served with a notice by the
I committee that the department must be
conducted during the month of March for i
$20,000. This was to include all expenses- !
material, labor, sweeping and contracts
other than those specially provided for.
Mr. Donovan at once threw down the
gauntlet to the committee, saying it was ;
i impossible to do the work for that
I amount. He presented the following
statement as to the monthly expenses of
the department:
! Sweeping streets $16,000
Repair of bitumen pavements 1,718
Buggy hire, head gardener 20
Buggy hire. Street Committee expert 4' l
Rent two corporation yards 115
Repairs Fourth-street bridge (contract)... 100
appointments by Supervisors.... 1,550
Coal and wood, Fourth-street bridge 60
Total 115, 603 j
In addition to this he told of material I
required, such as pipe, gravel, brick, ce
ment, basalt blocks, lumber and also of
repairs to streets in front of city prop- ;
erty. A low estimate of this, he said. â 
would be $5000. This would all have to be ]
paid before one single laborer could be :
employed. He openly scoffed at the idea
as being ridiculous, and said he would
pay no attention to it. Upon this showing ;
the committee withdrew its notice. The
! $9000 a month allowed the department. for |
labor is said to be the lowest for many
years. As far back as December, 1877, the ,
department was allowed under the law
100 men and twenty-five horses and carts.
| Chairman Aigeltinger of the Street Com
mittee was present during- the session and
seconded Mr. Donovan's efforts to pre
vent what he termed the crippling of the
department.
IT WAS A RACE FOR LIFE, j
Remarkable Sight Witnessed by the
Oakland Ferry passengers. '/ â '* h.
The passengers on one of the Oakland
ferry boats were treated to an unusual
eight yesterday afternoon. P. H. Schlotz
hauer of Dimond, Alameda County, took
on board five carrier pigeons, wmch he is
training for a long flight from Oregon.
One of the lot, a beautiful carrier named
Duke of Dimond, who has already flown
home from Tehachapl, was among them
in order to act as a guide for the younger
carriers. As soon as the pigeons were lib
erated they mounted in circles in the air,
heading generally toward the east. It
was a pretty sight, and the passengers
watched with interest the movements of
the intelligent birds until they were a
mile away.
Suddenly what were supposed to be two
of the pigeons were seen to be in rapid
flight toward the ferry boat. On they
came, as swift as the flight of an ar
row, and those who had good eyesight
saw that it was not two carriers, but one
pigeon pursued by a savage hawk. The
race for life was indeed exciting, and of
course the sympathy was with the carrier.
At times the hawk seemed to gain and
again to lose. Strange to say the flight
was in a direct line for the boat, the pur
sued seeming to know that there he had
friends. When a hundred feet high and
almost over the boat the carrier closed
his wings and dropped like a atone to the
deck, with the hawk but a few feet away.
Like a flash the carrier's wings were
spread, a few feet above the upper deck,
â  and he sailed into a group of ladies, safe
from all harm. His pursuer retreated.
The Duke was the hero of the remainder
of the trip. 'â '___

NOW HE WANTS
TO OBTAIN HIS
PRESENTS BACK
Nagle Has His Ex-
Fiancee Arrested.
A RING AND A CARBUNCLE
RATHER MAKE HATS THAN
MARRY THE ATTORNEY.
Touching Tale of a Pretty Geary-
Street Milliner and a Lawyer
Who Declares He Will Not
Be Bunkoed.
Attorney C. G. Nagle swore out a war
rant for the arrest of Mrs. Liilie Rodgers
on the charge of felonious embezzlement
in Judge Mogan's court yesterday morn
ing. .'.".-.".'
So anxious -was the friend of the Rev. C.
O. Brown that the arresting officer should
make no mistake in the performance of
his duty that he accompanied the repre
sentative of the law to the milliner's es
tablishment on Geary street, and with his
own well manicured but unfortunately
ringless finger pointed out the woman
whose detention he prayed the court to
grant.
According to the attorney, the offense
the hat maker Is charged with is having
in her possession a garnet and diamond
ring that should be ornamenting the
Nagle digit. He claims that he has tried
many times and oft to regain possession
of his jewel, but on each and every occa
sion was given the ha-ha by the merry
milliner.
Nagle's story of the loss of his ornament
is a touching tale of a story of unsophis
ticated man's suffering: of how a carbun
cle proved the legitimate successor to the
much abused pleasant "procrastination"
proposition, and a final determined chap
ter that should be entitled "I won't be
bunkoed."
Strangely enough, Mrs. Rodders' story
Is diametrically opposed to the Nagle tale,
and what he cites as facts the lady ridi
cules and terms fiction. According to the
lady, she once honored the attorney by ]
considering herself his affianced wife, yet j
according to Nagle there never was any |
engagement existing between them. ."She
la a divorced woman and has a child," j
says the plaintiff. "My husband is dead !
and I have no family," says the defend- :
ant. If Nagle had not been addicted to ',
carbuncles this trouble would have never I
occurred. On the 20th day of November
a pretty red but unbecoming bud was
preparing to blossom on the Nagle coun- j
tenance. As is the nature of Its kind, the '
flowering was heralded by shooting pains, I
that made the wearer weak and helpless.
To stay his fainting spirit the attorney ;
repaired to the Bay State oyster house, j
on Stockton street, and indulged in a "cup i
of tea and English chops." Mrs. Rodgers
was also present in the oyster house, "but
she was not eating." After his frugal re- i
past Nagle went to the telephone to sum- ,
mon the doctor to ease his handsome face. I
He raised his hand, to the instrument,
Mrs. Rodgers saw the ring andâ according
to Nagleâ that was the last he saw of It.
"Mrs. Rodgers saw the ring while I was \
at the 'phone," the attorney explained,
"and begged that I take It from my finger
and let her examine It. I did so. I had
a chat with the doctor over the line, and 'â¢
he asked me to come out to him. I pre- :
pared to go, and as I was leaving the
restaurant I said to Mrs. Rodgers, 'Give
me back my ring.' She laughed, and said,
'Later,' and I went off.
"About four days after I was going to
a Masonic gathering, and wishing to do !
honor to the affair I thought I would j
wear my ring. So I called on Mrs. Rod
gers and asked her for It, but she said \
she had mislaid It. The time went on,
and I made numerous demands for my
jewel, but was always laughingly put off. j
Finally I sent B. K. Collier to Mrs. Rod- :
gers' home at 3853 Twenty-third street, I
but he received no satisfaction. I had the j
lady arrested this morning, not on ac- j
count of the value of the ring, but I want
to show her she can't bunko me.
"Once when I told her unless she re
turned me the ring I should have her ar
rested she laughed and said, 'You are too
prominent a man to dare to have a
woman arrested.' "
Nagle claims that he first met the mil
liner a year ago last November in a pro
fessional way, and that at that time the
lady was betrothed to the Rev. N. J. B.
Schultz. a Unitarian minister. He further
states that she is the divorced wife of
Joser*h Rodgers of Hanford, that he has
never been engaged to marry the lady and
that at the present time she is receiving
the attentions of Harry R. Fee, a clerk
in the San Francisco Trading Stamp Com
pany.
After her arrest, while waiting in* the
City Prison for the bonds that would re
lease her, the milliner made the following
statement:
"I was engaged to be married to Attor
ney Nagle, and kept company with him
for twelve months. I then gave him up
and started in business. I know nothing
about his ring. I was very much sur
prised when Nagle and a policeman came
into my store this morning and told me I
was under arrest."
The statement that she was a divorcee
and had been betrothed to the Rev. Mr.
Schultz Mrs. Rodgers emphatically de
nied.
The case will come up for trial this
morning at 10 o'clock before Judge Mogan.
"YOU'RE NO GENTLEMAN."
Warm Words Bandied Between I an
j Acting Police Judge and
'". an Attorney.
The air in acting Police Judge Barry's
courtroom was full of sulphur for a few
minutes yesterday morning while the case
of Cash Crosby, charged With vagrancy,
was being heard. ' Crosby is a "stall" for
female pickpockets, and had haunted the
Judge's courtroom, intimidating a young
girl charged with grand larceny till the
Judge ordered him into custody on a
charge of vagrancy.
Attorney Pistoles! appeared for Crosby
and soon he and. the Judge began to ex
change uncomplimentary remarks. The
Judge threatened to put Pistolesi in jail
and the attorney retorted that he could
put the Judge in jail. Then each said the
other was "no gentleman," and from the
loud tones of their voices people in the
corridor thought a fight was on. The
Judge convicted Crosby and ordered him
to appear for sentence to-day, which led
to ft yeauffl_j_f_v o^ ftes___te-^..._Â»* $_**.
I wonder was that Pistoles! was not ordered
into custody for contempt of court.

CHASED AND INTERCEPTED
DETERMINED NOT TO GO AGAIN
TO SAN QUENTIN.
He Is Held on a Charge of Burglary
and Also Has a Charge of
Extortion Against
â  â¢ r
Him.
George Mason, the ex-convict, who is
accused of being the principal in the ex
tortion of Gustav Sehw-arz of the Old
Louvre at the ferry in the beginning of
January, made a bold attempt to escape
..from Judge Slogan's courtroom yesterday
â  -morning, and caused for a few minutes
: . the wildest excitement among the crowd
â¢ .in the courtroom and in the corridor.
â â¢â¢â¢ .Mason had been brought from the City
â  Prison along with a lot of other prison
ers to await his preliminary examination
on/ a charge of burglary for breaking into
the room of Mrs. Cleopatra Hill in the
Hotel Palmerlee. 133 Ellis street, on Jan
uary. 22 last and stealing several articles
of" jewelry. His friend. Clay Markell,
.Charged with him on the extortion com
plaint, was in court, and kept close to the
dock, where Mason was confined.
â¢Policeman Coughlin, who has charge of
the prisoners, had been sent to the City
â  Prison by the Judge with a woman who
was subject to fits, and the Judge had
â¢ called Bailiff Barry to the -bench to talk
/.- to him, when Mason sprang over the
'â¢â¢â â¢wooden partition in the dock to the floor
â¢*, and started on a run for the side door
' .leading from the courtroom past the pros
;,â¢.. itlng attorney's office to the stairs lead
;.;â¢*. ing to the basement. There was a general
-:; : -y-ell in the courtroom, and Bailiff Barry
â  and his assistant, J. Harris, made a break
'â¢:â  for Mason. They were followed by De
â  ..V.'.teCtive Graham and several others.
"-':â¢â  Mason ran swiftly- down the stairs, fol
- -Mowed by the officers ami a crowd. Harris
. '.Veiling all the time: "Catch himâ catch
him.'" Three Chinese who were standing
"i: Mason's way were knocked nearly
. over the balustrade, and he looked like a
â  winner. Unfortunately for him, Coughlin
was returning from the prison, and just
â¢is he emerged from the doorway In the
<â â  fear of the basement he ran into Cough
â¢'"Ol*h's arms. Coughlin grabbed him by the
'.- â '-throat, threw him to the ground and held
,* .him while Bailiff Barry and Detective
-Graham put the handcuffs on him and led
him back to the courtroom.
"J. â¢ gave you a run for your moneys
worth."' panted Mason, as he was led
away. He declared that he would never
spend another term in San Quentin, and
li is thought that if he cannot effect his
escape he will commit suicide.
. When he was taken back to the court
room his case was at once called, and af
ter hearing the evidence the Judge held
hlrh to answer before the Superior Court
on the burglary charge in $3000 bonds.
His and Markell's preliminary examina
tion on the charge of extortion will come
, up this morning.
:>=:!.. Judge Mogan, In speaking of the facil
ity with which Mason was able to Jump
. out of the dock, said: "At the time of the
â¢ â¢â¢shooting by John Shaughnessy of John H.
Hughes In the corridor outside the court
room, when several prisoners attempted
to get out of the dock, 1 petitioned the
: Board of Supervisors to put up an iron
grating, the same as in Judge Conlan's
ft courtroom, to prevent prisoners from do
ing just what Mason has done; but no at
tention was paid to my request, and the
fault lies with them. The place from
where Mason jumped is only- about three
feet from the floor of the dock, and it
can be seeq^ how easy it is for a deter
mined prisoner to attempt to get away."

DIED FOR LOVE OF
POLICEMAN McGOWAN
Mrs. Gertie Reed Quarreled With Him for Drinking
and Committed Suicide by Inhaling Gas.
MRS. GERTIE REED, the sweet
heart of Policeman James Mc-
Gowan, had a quarrel with that
Individual last Thursday night,
and because he did not rejoin her at
the appointed rendezvous she took a
room in the lodging house at 308 Sutter
street, turned on both gas jets and
killed herself.
Her body was in the Morgue before
her sisters knew of her untimely end,
and when they arrived at the Coroner's
office, just before the beginning of the
inquest yesterday morning, they filled
the air with their lamentations.
.The testimony at the inquest showed
that the woman might have been re
suscitated had a physician been sent
with the Doctor's Daughters' ambu
lance, but Chief of Police Lees, who
has charge of the ambulance, evidently
does not think that a doctor need be
sent with the vehicle, for, as everybody
knows, a person injured mortally is al
ways officially supposed to postpone
dying until the arrival of the surgeon.
Joseph La Coste, night watchman Of
Madame Gombert's lodging house at
30S Sutter street, where Mrs. Reed
committed suicide, gave highly sensa
tional testimony regarding the heart
less conduct of the police and of a phy
sician. When the woman was found in
bed at 8 o'clock yesterday morning, ap
parently dead. La Coste assisted in re
moving the body from the room, which
was then filled with the fumes of es
caping gas. He placed his car to the
woman's heart and could detect a faint
fluttering; of that organ. Her flesh was
warm, and even feverishly so. and
when he appealed to the four
policemen In attendance to bring a
physician in order that the unfortu
nate woman might be restored to life,
they paid no heed, and two of them,
Policemen Henry J.'Pyle and John J.
Prendergast, scoffed at him and bru
tally ordered him to "dry up."
The heartlessness of the two police
men was equaled by Dr. Arthur A.
Stern of 246 Sutter street. La Coste
swore that, failng to get the policemen
to do anything, he ran to Dr. Stern's
office and informed the doctor that a
woman was dying from the effects of
gas asphyxiation and that he was
wanted to resuscitate her.
"What house is it?" asked Stern.
"308 Sutter street," replied La Coste.
"Oh, 1 won't go to that house." said
Stern, and slammed the door in La
Coste's face.
The Doctor's Daughters' ambulance
remained in front of the house for half
an hour, and was then driven away,
leaving the body for the Morgue wag
on.
La Coste said that he had known the
deceased and her family for about a
year. She had been in the habit of oc
cupying a room at the lodging house
once a week or so, and on those occa
sions she was accompanied by Police
man McGowan. Last Thursday- night
at about 12 o'clock she came to the
lodging house and paid for a room. She
told La Coete that the policeman would
arrive shortly, and requested La Coste
to notify her when he came. When the
clerk escorted her to the apart
ment usually occupied by her, she
burst into tears.
"What is the matter with you?
asked La Coste. ,
a She explained that McGowan's
NOW LOOK OUT FOR
DANGEROUS DELAYS
CHINESE FISHERMEN EACH RE
LEASED ON A $100 BOND.
Attorney Quinn Wants to Postpone
the Trial Until He Has Time to
"Fix" Matters Up.
Ah Sen, Ah Tow, Ah Hee, Ah Sing and
Ah TI, the Chinese fishermen who were
arrested Thursday in San 'Pablo Bay by
Constable Creed of Marin County for Ille
gal fishing, were allowed bail by Justice
Bellrude of Sausalito yesterday after
noon at .100 each. The ball was furnished
by John J. Quinn of San Francisco, at
torney for the defendants, and Young
Sing of the firm of Quong Lee Chung &
Co., by whom the fishermen were em
ployed. The five Chinamen were taken
from Tiburon yesterday morning to Sau
salito by Constable Creed.
Attorney Quinn, accompanied by Young
Sing, went to Sausallto yesterday after
noon at 2 o'clock prepared to furnish
bonds. When Justice Bellrude fixed the
sum at $100 each, he quickly drew up the
bonds and endeavored to have them ac
cepted at once, but the Justice insisted
on awaiting the arrival of District At
torney Mclsaac. When the District At
torney came he demanded that a local
bondsman be furnished. This Quinn said
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 4. 1899,
friends had Insulted her, and that she
felt badly about it.
"Didn't ho take your part?" inquired
the clerk.
"No," answered Mrs. Reed, "he took
sides with his friends against me."
La Coste advised her to cheer up and
not to think anything about it, and
then he left her. Policeman McGowan
did not put in an appearance during
the night, nor at the inquest in the
morning.
At 4 a. m. a messenger boy who oc
cupied a room across the hall from the
apartment of Mrs. Reed heard her
weeping and sobbing loudly, but not
knowing who was inside he did not
make any inquiry or interfere in any
way.
Sirs. Jennie Moore of 322 Seventh
street and Miss K. E. Fullan of 1112.-
Harrison street, sisters of the dead
woman, were witnesses. Gertie resid
ed with Miss Fullan and was In the
best of spirits on Thursday night.
When she left the house she said that
she was going to meet McGowan and
attend the performance at the Orphe
um, and that she would be home early.
That was the last her sisters saw of
her until they wept over her dead
body in the Morgue. They had never
heard her threaten to kill herself, but
she used to become despondent at
times during attacks of neuralgia in
the head, to which she was subject.
Policeman McGowan knew nothing
of the tragic affair until informed
about it by the sisters of his fiancee
after the inquest. He denied that he
had had any improper relations with
Mrs. Reed, and the tears stood in his
eyes when he spoke of the affection
which he entertained for her. He had
Intended to marry her within a short
time, he said, and he was deeply
shocked when he heard of her death.
While going to meet her that evening
on Market street he met four gentle
men friends and they invited him to
dinner. He excused himself, saying
that he was on the way to meet his
girl. Then they Invited him to bring
his girl alcng. He did so, and they
went to a restaurant on O'Farrell
street. Gertie seemed to be happy and
light-hearted, although she felt a lit
tle embarrassed because she was the
only woman in the party. After din
ner McGowan. desiring to make a
slight return to his friends for their
civility, invited them into a saloon for
a parting drink.
Gertie objected strenuously. She
said that .he did hot want him to go
into the saloon at all: but he went, nev
ertheless, with his friends. telling Ger
tie at the same time that he would not
remain long. He stayed in the saloon
about five minutes, and when he came
out she had disappeared. He never
saw her alive again.
"If I had known that she was In the
room waiting for me," he Bald, "I
would have gone up there at once."
Mme. Gombert, the landlady, made
the jurors laugh. She deplored the loss
of the gas from the two jets left open
by the deceased.
"It's too much trouble for four bits,"
she said. Then she spoke about a
man who committed suicide in her
house in the same way a few weeks
ago and allowed .4 worth of gas to
escape.
"The next time one man comes to
my house to keel heemself I give him
four bits to go to Oakland."
Mrs. Reed was a widow, 24 years old,
and was very pretty. Her husband
committed suicide in Oakland by
asphyxiation about four years ago.
The jury returned a verdict of sui
cide in Mrs. Reed's case.
he was unable to do, and seemed to be
nettled that his bond and that of Young
Sing was not acceptable. The matter
was finally adjusted by Justice Bellrude
accepting the bonds, with an additional
cash bond of $25, which was furnished by
Attorney Quinn. The case was set. for
trial on Tuesday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
Attorney Quinn attempted to secure
more time and wanted the case set for
next Saturday. Constable Creed says he
waE approached D. Quinn as soon as he
reached Sausalito, and that Quinn said to
him:
"Get the case put off until a week from
Saturday. By that time the papers will
let up and we can get this matter fixed
up."
License Collector John H. Davis of the
Board of Fish Commissioners was in
Sausalito yesterday and his attention was
called to the fact that the captured junk
of the Chinamen had no tag on its stern
displaying the number of the license, as
is required. He immediately swore out
a warrant against the captain of the crew
for not having a license. The law reads
that when the number of the license is
not displayed on each side of the stern
of the boat, the license granted by the
Fish Commissioners is to be forfeited.
There is very little chance of the cas.
being tried Tuesday, as Attorney Quinn
intimated to the court that he would
probably want a further continuance at
that time.

The San Francisco Labor Council at Its
meeting last night indorsed the resolu

WILL DEMAND
SEPARATION
FROM A FRAUD
Mrs. Lawczynski Asks
for Freedom.
SUIT TO BE FILED TO-DAY
CHARGES HER FALSE COUNT
WITH DESERTION.
Interesting Details of a Hurried
'Marriage With a Fictitious
Nobleman and Its
Results.
As was exclusively published and pre
dicted in The Call of Sunday last, Mrs.
Teofil de Lawczynski will to-day, through
her attorney, E. F. Bert, file her suit for
separation from the fictitious Count who
duped her into marriage just a year ago.
The complaint will merely charge the
fraudulent nobleman with desertion and
failure to provide; but behind these sim
ple charges is a romance the history of
which has already been told in these col
umns.
Lawczynski arrived in this city during
the early part of last year, and lived a
hand-to-mouth existence. He assumed the
title of Count, and was known to the
habitues of a downtown music-hall by
that high-sounding appellation. He man
aged to be introduced to Mrs. H. L.
Fabry, the complainant, who was the
widow of the well-known merchant of
that name, who was accidentally asphyxi
ated by gas in August, 1897. He believed
her to be possessed of a large sum of
money left her and her son by her first
husband, and he paid ardent court and
won her. Two weeks after their engage
ment he secured a marriage license and
they were united by Judge J. V. Coffey
at the residence of the bride's mother,
Mrs. A. yon Gerzabek, 605 Steiner street.
Within a week after the wedding the
impostor managed to secure $500 and a lot
of jewelry from his wife, and left this
city for Chicago, where he alleged he had
a medical practice. On his arrival in the
windy city he visited his wife's relatives
and borrowed a few hundred dollars on
the jewelry and decamped for Europe,
where he now is, practicing similar
schemes. . ,
Lawczynski was known throughout the
country as a clever faker. It was his
plan to simulate suicide In front of a
handsome residence, and on being cared
for by those who found him he would
work on their sympathies and receive sub
stantial aid to tide him over what he rep
resented to be temporary distress. He
was compelled to flee from the City Of
Mexico and Chicago, as his practice be
came notorious, and he was in danger of
arrest. _ , , . Â
The mother of Mrs. Lawczynski believes
j her daughter was hypnotized by the
' scoundrel, and she was instrumental in
! having the latter take this means of rid
l ding herself of a distasteful name and its
[ unworthy owner.
THE NEXT PRESIDENT.
Joseph Bidwell of Chicago Thinks It
Will Be McKinley.
Joseph E. Bidwell, Railroad and Ware
house Commissioner of Illinois, arrived
in this city yesterday from the southern
part of the State with his wife and is a
guest at the Occidental. He has come
here in search of health, and says that
he has been much benefited during his
two months' sojourn in Los Angeles.
Mr. Bidw'ell has been a member of the
Chicago Council and is a successful poli
tician of the windy city. He is a brother
of "Dick" Bidwell, the well-known prison
keeper at the City Prison. â  He has been
a delegate to three Republican National
Conventions and is well posted on such
matters. Although he is a Reed man, he
believes that McKinley will be renomi
nated for the Presidency by acclamation
at the next convention, and will be
elected by an overwhelming majority, es
pecially- if Bryan gets the Democratic
nomination. '
BOOKS FOR THE HOME.
How Oro Pino Parlor, N. D. O. W.,
Proposes to Lay the Founda
tion of a Library.
Oro Fino Parlor, Native Daughters of
the Golden West, has devised a plan to
build up a library for the Native Daugh
ters' Home. It has decided to give a
social at the home, .25 O'Farrell .tree*,
on next Wednesday evening under the
auspices of the board of relief, and has
fixed the price of admission at one bound
book for each person who shall attend.
There is hardly a Native Daughter or a
Native Son who has not one or more
bound books that he or she can spare,
and such presented as an admission fee
ought to make up a library of which the
home can feel proud. There will be pre
sented a good programme of entertain
ment.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. March Stock dealings were
In moderate volume to-day. which Induced
sharp net gains gen. rally, with a firm tone
prevailing at the close. The realizing, which
appeared yesterday, continued but a short time
and the market quieted down with an appear
ance ln many stocks of a hardening tendency.
Traders were inclined to cover to some ex
tent on the appearance of some so-called good j
buying, which encouraged endeavors for the
long account. Brooklyn Transit and St. Louis
Southewestern preferred were strong and there
were a number of advances among the special
ties, Including Consolidated Gas, Metropolitan. j
General Electric. American Tinplate and To- ;
bacco. The upward manipulation of the latter
stock, which reached 197, was or. the theory ;
that It would have a monopoly of the trade
by its acquisition of the Union Tobacco Com
pany. The success of the Chicago and Alton j
was the subject of favorable comment because
of the beneficial effect on the general rail- I
road situation, which it was assured would re
cult from the deal. Out of town houses were -
purchasers, except those In the West, which :
bought and sold. Arbitrage houses disposed
of some 20,000 shares, a portion of which they
repurchased. A delay In cable service had a :
restricting effect upon -he arbitrage business.
While there was a little activity on the part of i
commission houses, the hulk of the day's op- I
erations appeared to be professional. Some |
room traders fancied that from the nature of
the dealings interests which had recently mar- I
keted large lines of Burlington and Atchison
preferred repurchased some of the former
holdings. The sudden call of 810,000,000 from j
subscribers to the new baking powder com- i
line carried the loaning: rate of call money
sharply upward, a small amount being loaned â 
as hish as 4% per cent. This circumstance
was reflected. in the very* weak sterling market.
Some Irregularity occurred in to-day's bond I
market, which, however, did not Impair the
general undertone of firmness. Louisville,
Evansville and St. Louis fives were again the
feature, rising 3 points and practically losing
the advance. Total sales, $3,375,000.
United States threes, the old fours and the
old fours registered advanced % in the bid
price.

BRADSTREET* S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, March Bradstreet' Finan- j
I cial Review to-morrow will say:
Irregularity ln prices at the beginning of I
I the present week was followed by Increasing j
weakness and evidences of speculative liqui- j
dation, with a sharp upward rally in Friday's :
: transactions. Exceptional strength was shown
by the stocks which most easily reflect the cur- j
! rent boom ln the iron and steel industries. In ,
! spite of this and evidences of support In some
1 other parts of the list, the market acted as
i if the recent advances and the speculative buy
ing which they attracted had left it ripe for <
I reaction. The downward movement beg on
; Tuesday. Some irregular recoveries on Wednes
t day were mingled with further realizing and
1 selling out of weak accounts, while on Thurs- I
i day th% latter process assumed still larger pro
j portions and even carried with It the steel
stocks which had thus far shown strength in
the face of the general declining tendency. The
: larger interests which had taken the lead at the
j beginning of the recent upward movement of
prices were, with some exceptions, passive and
seemed willing to allow prices to settle down
while the professional traders, as was natural
under the circumstances, generally showed an
Inclination to work on the bear side. In fact,
some of the larger people were suspected of
having shifted their forces with the object of
making a turn on the short account. The rise
on Friday was in a great degree due to the
i short interest, which was alarmed by the ap- ;
; pearance of renewed support in some of the :
'. manipulated stocks and specialties. While at
the opening of the week there was a further
moderate amount of buying by commission
'uses, the later days presented increasing cvi
â  dences of selling from such quarters. London
displayed only a restricted interest in Ameri
can securities, and the foreign representatives
here were irregular In their activity, but prob
ably purchased a fair amount of stocks on
: balance. In fact, not only Is it -to be nt ed
that the recent heavy selling of foreign invest- j
ment holdings of our securities has ceased, but
that outgoing European steamers from New !
York are again carrying consignments of our
stocks. In most cases these shipments are
made up of low-priced specialties and stocks
like Ontario and Western,, In which the London
market has learned there are more or less im- |
portant developments pending.
j The slightly firmer tone of the money market |
and the fact that many lenders object to in
dustiials as collateral, while in practically a..
case asking high rates where such I
stock forms any considerable part of
the . security for loans, were discussed
â  more or less, though it cannot be said
j that they furnished ground for the liquidating
i tendency. At the same time such symptoms
I are not without effect after the market has ex
: perienced an exhibition of bullish speculation ,
I and the continued creation of new industrial
I companies, with the attending desire of part of
the public tp buy their securities on margin
for â  speculative purposes, la still regarded In
; some quarters as the weak spot in the market. !

1 dry goods. manufacturing. Industrials and
j other lines are of course noticed in Wall street,
' though the impression that the market has dis
counted them temporarily is very prevalent
I there. It must, however, be observed that the
declines have been on the whole of a moderate
kind and that none of the week's developments
1 have been of a character to seriously disturb
J values, while there were a number which might
serve as prospective reasons for bullish de*.
. monstrations In certain parts of the list.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. March 3.â R. G. Dun's weekly
review of trade will say to-morrow:
The business for the past month was the ,
greatest ever done in February. Clearing ;
! house exchanges were about $7,000,800,000, against |
$5,567,553,844 last year, and 54.2 per cent j
L larger than in 1892. In all the years of weekly :
! commercial reportftig there has been no other I
! week in which the reports from all parts of
the country have been on the whole so good .
as they are this week. Moreover, during the
past week there has been a general advance
In wages, Immediate or prospective. At most j
points the advance of 10 per cent or more was 1
entirely voluntary. It has averaged 5 to 10 j
per cent in tin plate works and about 10 per
cent in other cases, and as it affects much
; over 100,000 hands, it will add greatly to the
i purchasing power of the wagearners.
The returns of failures in February, while
showing larger liabilities than in January, are
highly encouraging. A rather unusual num
ber of large failures in scattered branches of
I manufacture has swelled tne aggregate, in
cluding one concern for $1,000,000 in electrical
apparatus, - but in nearly all branches the
statement indicates a remarkably healthy con
dition in spite of these failures, while ln trad
ing the defaulted liabilities are smaller than '
i in January or any previous winter month for
six years. In prices the striking feature has
been the rapid advance in Iron and steel pro- :
j ducts, resulting from a demand greater than
; the works in the country can supply. All the
i works of importance have been crowded with
orders running to July and later. Belated
I buyers have given life to concerns long in-
I active, and . as these can add but little to
I the output the markets have been entirely con
i trolled by the buying demand. All sorts of
I prices have been paid, some for early de
livery and some for delivery after July, but
I $13 50 is quoted for bessemer pig at Pitts
burg; $12 50 for gray forge, and at the East
j $14 25 Is quoted for anthracite No. 1. Prices \
I of finished products have also been advanced j
$2 per ton for Eastern and Western bars, I
I plates and structured forms, and $3 for wire ,
I nails. The demand has not yet ocen checked j
j and some heavy orders have been taken at '
all points, even at the highest prices named, |
; but the export busines Is likely to be- stopped j
! for the present. Holders of. wheat have been
'â  looking! for the report of the Agricultural De
partment regarding sticks held by farmers ]
March 1, but commercial reports indicate that I
1 such are largest ever held at this date; They
have to support them, the Western receipts, |
I which have been larger than for past years
: in February for four weeks, 12,571,000 bushels,
! against 10,004.600 bushels last year, while At- |
I lantic exports have been for four weeks 12,829,- '.
1 756, against 9.878.636 last year. The Pacific J
j exports have been 605.737 bushels for the week, ]
â¢ against 64,993 last year, and from other ports !
187,828 bushels have been shipped during the j
past week. Rarely if ever lias there been
as great a demand for grain as at this season,
i but the price has yielded l%c for the week,
although corn has advanced %c for spot, the
I receipts having fallen. The textile industries
i are making progress. There has been a strong i
increase in the demand for cotton goods re
; sulting in further advances In the prices for ;
I some, while in woolen goods a slight advance
i appears, notwithstanding a decline in the
prices of wool during February. The decline ,
; has not been general In wool, nor has the I
' advance in goods. The heavyweight season has j
been disappointing, and the manufacturers are 1
I willing to get on for the time as best they
can In the hope that larger demand will come |
: from the clothiers a little later.
Failures for I the week have been, In the |
i United States, 186, against 191 last year, and |
I 47 in Canada, against 32 last year.
i BRADSTREETR ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK, March Bradstreet's to-mor
j row will say: -
An enlarged volume of spring trade, par
ticularly in dry goods, due to spring weather,
i special strength ln the demand and price for
cotton fabrics, an immense and urgent call at
' scaring prices for iron and steel and all its
products, ' and substantial advances in wages, |
I chiefly affecting the above-mentioned . indus
-1 tries and benefiting at a conservative, calcu
i lation 1 110, COO operatives, are among the feat
] ures of the week, going to show that, the
producing elements of the country*" popula
tion are sharing in the present favorable con-
I dition. From many cities East and West come'
! reports of an active demand from Jobbers for
spring dry goods. From the cotton manufac
turing industry come reports of activity, in
ducing manufacturers to grant advances to
their operatives, while the list of advances in
prices of iron and steel products is a virtual
rollcall of ,that industry's products. An en
couraging feature is the small number of
1 strikes for higher wages reported, partly owing
1 to advances being already conceded as a re
sult of sliding scale agreements, the only Im-
I portant labor troubles being reported in the
i coal mining Industry In the Southwest. Ad
! ditional proof that, the export demand for our
I iron and steel manufactures will be checked
I by recent j and pending price ; advances Is not

lacking. In the lumber trade the producer
seems likely also to reap a long delayed re
ward, as buyers became familiar with the
fact that available supplies are well controlled,
while the outlook for building trade activity is
favorable. Our export trade in cereals is re
covering from the check administered by re
cent frigid and stormy weather, but reports
of damage to the winter wheat crop on the
one hand and estimates of superabundant sup
plies of old crop in farmers' hands have about
balanced each other with a slight advantage
as regards prices secured by the bears.
Prices generally, aside from the exceptions
noted, show few important changes. Corn is
slightly higher, while oats are fractionally
lower. The movement of cotton at the South
has proved smaller than anticipated, and as
the current consumption is heavy both at home
and abroad quotations are slightly higher.
Lead and copper continue the retrograde
movement noted last week, and coffee is also
lower. '.
Talk of new combinations in many lines of
trade continues active, but signs are not want
ing that promoters find it harder to place
shares of companies not widely known,
Business failures are down to the minimum,
numbering 177 for the â  week, as against 220
last week, 232 in this week a year ago, 262
in 1897, 270 in 1896, and 252 in 1895.
â¢ Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 5,815.585 bushels, against 3.
- 844.559 bushels last week, 3.252,003 bushel, in
the corresponding week of 1898; 2.075,400 bushels
! in 1887; 2.407,679 bushels in 1898, and 3,272..'27
i bushels in 1895. Since July 1 this season, the
j exports of wheat aggregate 168,712,934 bushels,
I against 164,465,753 bushels last year.
Business failures In the Dominion of Can-
I ada this week number 37, as compared with
39 last week; 27 in this week a year ago; 51
in 1597; 66 in 1896, and 53 In 1895.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 3.â Mild and rainy weather
to be followed by a cold wave, together with
independent strength of the foreign markets,
were the Items of information from which
traders imbibed the slight decoction of bullish
spirit that was indicated by- a %c advance
in the price of May wheat at the start. Ar
gentine shipments during the week amounted
to 1.432,000 bushels wheat, compared with 1,
--296,000 bushels the week before. The Increase
had a bearish effect upon the crowd, but the
news from the country correspondents to com
mission houses concerning the condition ; of
wheat, was generally bad, and. held any ex
tensive selling In check. Advices from > Cali
fornia were to the effect that the rains the
bears have been making so much of here did
not fall where wheat la grown to any extent
and that the drought -till continued, with
wheat ruling at a sharp advance In price.

.-'.''â¢â ', ..Unfortunate Schooner W. S.
Phelps Sailing of the
Brig Galilee.
Tip. British tramp steamer Wyefleld has
had a narrow escape from destruction. In
fact,- just how narrow the escape was no
one knew until the vessel was placed on
the- drydcck last Tuesday. Then It was
disc6vered that a hole twenty inches long
by- ten inches broad had been pierced in
the" keel plate, and that nothing but the
yes. l'_ water tight compartments had
kept tier afloat. 'â¢ ' .
The Wyefield left Nanalmo. B. C, on
February 1. for San Francisco with 4500
tons of coal aboard. While in charge of
the Sound pilot shs struck on a rock, but
floated off. The water tight compartments
were all closed and an examination
showed that one of them was rapidly fill
ing with Water. Captain Cartmer ordered
ah 'examination of all the other compart
ments, and when It was reported that they.
â  were making no water he determined to
proceed. About 300 tons of coal was jet
tisoned, and then the Wyefield came on,
making the run to San Francisco in four
days. Her cargo was discharged as
q-jickly as possible and she was taken to
Hunters Point drydock. The necessary
repairs have been made and she will go to
sea again to-day.
â¢'.The unfortunate schooner W. S. Phelps
is in more trouble. Now that she has
completed her long and uneventful voy
age between San Pedro and San Francisco
via Santa Cruz and has incidentally run
up a large bill of expenses, no one seems
to. -care about appearing as her owner.
â¢'.Directly she reached port her old master
-filed a libel on her in the United States
District Court for wages, and now Captain
Peterson wants to know who is going to
pay him and the crew for the fifty-one
days they were at sea. It was only "after
some maneuvering that a tug to take the
pjchooner to Oakland Creek was secured,
and there the vessel is likely to remain for
â p .me time. It was only a few months
ago that she was sold by the United
States Marshal in San Pedro for her
,-lieb.Sv and It begins to look as though she
would be sold again at auction in this
p.rt.
The brig Galilee, with the French malls
aboard, got away for Tahiti yesterday.
She- took away five passengers, among
whom were H. Atwater, formerly United
States Consul at Papeete; two Mormon
missionaries, and J. J. Muth, who is re
turning to the islands after a visit to
Germany. The Galilee took away an un
usually large cargo; in fact, some of the
freight had to be left behind.
The pig presented by the crew of the bat
â¢ tleship Oregon to Golden Gate Park was
taken from the steamer Australia yester
day. Generalissimo Weyler, as tin- pig is
named, was captured with the Spanish
cruiser Cristobal Colon.. The Jackles kept
the animal, intending to present it to the
park zoo, but when the battleship was
ordered to Manila the m. thought it
bes..t to send the generalissimo on by the
Australia. â  â¢
: A" letter from the captain of the Oregon
to Mayor Phelan accompanied the pig, and
yesterday his Worship sent a wagon for
the present. Chief Officer Lawless and
the crew of the Australia decorated the
pig with red, white and blue bunting and
made'out of him the handsomest pig ever
seen on the water front. When it came
to saying good-by Generalissimo Wey
ler refused to leave the ship and his ship
mates, and it was only with many
squeaks and grunts of protest that he
was finally got over the vessel's side and
into the wagon. Passing along the front
he made one or two attempts at escape
and finally had to be roped down to save
trouble.
The transport Valencia will get away
for Manila this afternoon. She will carry
about 150 soldiers, a number of whom are
young officers just commissioned from
West Point. The Valencia will also take
away $1,500,000 ln treasure, with which to
pay the soldiers.
James Kitterman of the launch Ameri

Judgments Against William Finch
and E. W. Jordan Reversed.
The cases against William Finch, cap
tain of the Gaelic, and F. W. Jordan,
Pilot, who were recently arrested at the
instance of the Board of Health on the
misdemeanor charge of violating the
health ordinance relating to landing from
vessels prior to a clean bill of health be
ing granted by the Quarantine Officer of
the Board of Health, were called yester
day before- the criminal department of
the Superior Court, Judges Cook, Dunne
and Lawlor sitting in bank. Finch and
Jordan were convicted in the Police
Court and lined $10 each, but both took
an appeal. * The arrest was the result of
a clash of authority between Dr. Rose
nau, United States Quarantine Officer,
and Dr. Chalmers, local Quarantine Offi
cer, the men arrested refusing to obey
the order of the latter on the ground that
they had a permit from ffie former offi
cer. Yesterday the court decided in fa
vor of the captain and pilot, and Inci
dently in favor of the United States
officer. The opinion of the court, placing
the United States over the local officer,
and thereby releasing the accused and or
dering the judgment of the Police Court
reversed, Is based on the following state
ments of law:
"There is vested in the State authority
to frame quarantine regulations; similar
authority is vested in the United States
Government. But. when the State regu
lations affecting a certain port do not ap
pear to cover all the ground or efficiently
control all matters concerning the quar
antining of vessels in that port, then the
President has power to issue a procla
mation, setting forth the fact that it ap
pears that the quarantine regulations af
fecting that port are inefficient, and to
himself appoint a Federal Quarantine Offi
cer to fill the breach." ;
DEITZ DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS DIVORCED
NOR THAT AN INJUNCTION HAD
BEj-JN ISSUED.
Was Brought Into Court on an At
tachment and Was Granted the
Privilege of Retaining
Counsel.
John Deltz, an Iron worker employed in
the Union Iron Works, was divorced on
the 23d ult., and was ignorant of the fact
up till yesterday. Some time ago his
wife, Grace Deltz, brought suit for di
vorce against him. alleging cruelty as a
cause of action. Time passed by and the
defendant failed to answer, so a default
was entered against him. The suit was
heard and Mrs. Deitz was granted a di
vorce, together with an injunction re
straining Deitz from drawing his money
from a local bank. A few days ago Deitz
drew some money from the bank and an
attachment was issued for him. that he
might be brought before the court and
show cause why he should not be pun
ished for contempt of court.
Yesterday the attachment was served
and Deitz was brought into court. Sur
prise was manifest on his face and he
immediately took the stand to defend his
position. He explained to the court that
he did not even know that a divorce had
been granted his wife, to say nothing of
his ignorance regarding the restraining
order issued by the court. He said that
he had not been serVed with the restrain
ing order, and when he drew the money
from the bank he was ignorant of its ex
istence. He also informed the court that
he did not wish a divorce from his wife,
although they had had a little misun
derstanding, and asked that he be al
lowed to employ counsel and reopen the
case. â - . ":â ;' _ _ -
His evident honesty impressed Judge
Daingerfield, who . was hearing the case,
and his request was honored. â¢> ? -c"'--~
The young man then deposited $550 with
the Sheriff to secure Mrs. Deitz against
loss and $150 of the amount was given
her for her immediate needs. Without
doubt the case will be reopened and again
heard before Mrs. Deitz can be assured
that she is legally free to take up her
| life- without a husband's aid.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1899.
AMBITION DROVE THIS
YOUTH TO SUICIDE
THE body of Morris A. Levy, bill
clerk for Lebenbaum & Co.,
grocers, was found yesterday
morning lying in the bushes in
Golden Gate Park, opposite the
bronze statue of the baseball player.
A gory face, a bullet wound in the
head and a nickel-plated American
bulldog revolver by his side were the
tragic evidences of suicide.
The dead boyâ for in appearance
he was no more than a lad of 16 or
17 years, though he had passed his
twenty-first birthdayâ bore an excel
lent reputation. He resided with his
parents at 1135 Geary street, and was
a model son. Young Levy gave his
parents no Inkling of the terrible
THE EFFECT OF THE
SWAB ORDINANCE
DR. T. L. MAHONEY'S CONTEN
TION IS SUSTAINED.
A Law Which Has No Effect in Cases
Diagnosed as Diphtheria
ative Only in Doubtful
Cases.
Dr. T. L. Mahoney has been sustained
by the Superior Court in his action refus
ing to submit swabs used on diphtheria
patients for the investigation of the Board
of Health. In sustaining Dr. Mahoney the
court also declared that the ordinance
compelling the "filing" of swabs referred
only to those used ln doubtful cases, not
in cases in which the disease has been
declared diphtheria by the attending phy-
slclan.
The Board of Supervisors, at the sug
gestion of the Board of Health, passed an
ordinance requiring physicians to return
swabs to the Health Office in cases of
suspected diphtheria. Dr. T. L. Mahoney
reported a case of diphtheria and the
swab was demanded, which he refused to
send. He was forthwith arrested and
tried in the Police Court. After an inter
esting trial, in which his testimony was
well sustained by that of Drs.*C. F. Buck
ley Perry, R. J. O'Connell and Dr. Kuhl
man as witnesses for Dr. Mahoney, the
prosecution being represented by Drs. A
P O'Brien, Dr. Rosenau, the federal
quarantine officer, and Dr. Spencer. Dr.
Mahoney was convicted of a violation of
the health ordinance. He appealed the
case to the Superior Court and it was
heard in bank, Judges Cook, Lawlor and
Dunne presiding. The decision of the low
act he had in contemplation. Last
Thursday evening he drew $10 from
the cashier and went out of the
store, returning in a short time with
$8, which he handed back. He re
marked that he had required only $2.
It ls believed that with the- $2 he
bought the cheap second-hand pistol
with which he killed himself.
When the body was searched at
the Morgue the following note was
found in his pocket, written with
pen and Ink. ] .-.- _.
CITY. 312, 1899.
To the General Publicâ your satis
faction I wish to state that this deed
is done for the reason that I failed to
lay the proper foundation for my future,
and, rather than fail, I resign to my self
destruction. ' ..â¢'.-
No boy had a better home than I have;
also being given more than was due me.
MORRIS A. LEVY.
Louis Levy, who keeps a tailor
shop at 83 Eddy street, Is the boy's
father. He testified that his son
never exhibited any signs of insan
ity or mental weakness. George W.
Byrnes, a bookkeeper, said the de- '
ceased was more than usually â 
strong-minded. Of late he had had 'â¢
fits of melancholy and was languid ;
and indisposed. He told the witness :
he was sorry that he was not better ;
off at the age of 21 than he was, but :
he did not say anything indicating ;
that he Intended to kill himself.
The jury returned a verdict of :
death by his own hands. <
er court was reversed, Dr. Mahoney gain
ing his point on the ground that he was
a qualified physician and that his report
of diphtheria was conclusive and did not
require the submitting of a swab to the
bacteriologist's confirmation.
The decision will meet with the approval
of the medical practitioners, who felt
that the submitting of swabs was a lim
itation of their privileges. It balks the
passage of further objectionable ordin
ances restraining physicians in the man
agement of their cases, for which they
are responsible and in the supervision of
which they consider they should not be
hampered. Dr. Mahoney was represented

Charles Lempe's Unpleasant Experi
ence in a Market-Street House.
Charles Lempe, who resides at 2120 Mis
sion street, had an experience last Thurs
day night which he does not wish to have
repeated.
He went, to the theater early ln the
evening, and on his way home stopped
into Sutton's saloon, at 1940 Market street.
After having a few drinks he told Sutton
that he did not care to go out home, and
asked if there were any rooms to be had
for the night in the vicinity. Sutton said
he could accommodate him, and showed
him to a room in a house at the rear of
his establishment. Lempe then retired
for the night and asked to be called at
6 o'clock.
At 3 o'clock ln the morning he was
awakened by a strange noise ln the room
and demanded to know who was there.
Sutton answered him, saying he had come
to call him. Lempe then said he did not
want to be awakened at that hour. The
next minute he received a stunning blow
on the head from the butt end of a pis
tol.
He immediately dressed and went to the
Seventeenth-street station and told his
story to Detectives Graham and Fitz
gerald. As his injuries were of a serious
nature he was sent to the City and Coun
ty Hospital for treatment. Sutton was
arrestee and charged with assault with
a deadly weapon. As Lempe claims to
have lost $4 in the room It l_ probable
that a charge of robbery will also be
placed against the saloon keeper.

BLOODSTAINS
ON THE SKULL
PRECEDED DEATH
A Severe Blow to
Brandes' Defense.
A VERY FATAL ADMISSION
DR. MULLER A REMARKABLE
EXPERT WITNESS.
He Now Says That Lillian Brandes
Died of Meningitis and Ho
Thus Assists the Prose
cution.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
; 90S Broadway, March 3.
The straws at which the defense in the
trial of William A. Brandes, charged with
the murder of his daughter, have been
reaching are rapidly floating away on the
tide of despair.
Another boomerang was developed at
.the trial to-day in the testimony of Dr.
H. E. Muller, an expert witness called by
the defense. Yesterday, in response to
a hypothetical question based on testi
, mony given by the defense's chief expert.
Dr. Woolsey, Dr. Muller gave It as his
opinion that Lillian Brandes died of
pleuro-pneumonia. On cross-examination
to-day Dr. Muller, in response to anofher
hypothetical question, based absolutely
on the facts and conditions as found in
(the remains of the dead girl by the au
topsy physicians, said that the girl died
of meningitis, totally ignoring the theory
of suicidal hanging in either instance. In
fact Dr. Muller, in reply to another ques
tion put by Attorney Bennett, said that
he "was no expert on hanging."
The manner of cross-examination as
conducted by District Attorney Allen and
his able assistant, Harry Melvin, was ex
-eptionally clever. Dr. Woolsey was a
prominent spectator early this afternoon,
and left the courtroom a madder man |
than when he entered, for Melvin rasped
his sensitiveness by announcing that he i
â¢would base no hypothetical questions on j
â any of Dr. Woolsey's testimony.
A most delicate ground was trodden at
one stage of tho proceedings this after- j
noon. Attorney Bennett had asked <
â¢whether Dr. Muller would have been more ;
able to answer certain questions if he ;
had examined the body than if he i
had not seen the remains. Witness an- j
. wered affirmatively. Later the prosecu- I
tion asked Dr. Muller a similar question, j
and before it was answered Juror Sieben
asked Dr. Muller "whether a physician ,
who had examined the body would not i
be better able to testify as to the con
ditions found and the cause of death
than one who had simply seen the skull
cap and membranes." To this question
Attorney Sawyer, for the defense, vigor- j
ously objected, and after some warm
cross firing Judge Hall ruled in favor of
the defense. -_Â_,
The vital part of Dr. Muller s testi- :
monv, however, brought out on cross
examination, was that, although the blood
might have settled in the posterior of Lil- I
lian Brandes' skull, the blood could not
Infiltrate through the tissues post mor
tem, and that therefore the blood stains
were ante-mortem. This is one of the se
verest -blows suffered by the defense thus
far and clearly bears out Dr. Buteau s
theory, discovered accidentally a few days
ago and exploited in yesterday's Call.
Expert Dr. Muller also stated that in
a case where every symptom of hanging
Is absent except the mark on the neck,
and the autopsy develops another sub
stantive cause of death, he would attrib
ute death to that other cause.
The statement published by certain
morning papers to the effect that the pros
ecution proposes to have Dr. Buteau dis
sect a human head in the presence of the
â¢jury is erroneous, and no such ghastly
performance will take place. Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Melvin holding that such
would prove a. vital error in the eyes of
the Supreme Court.
The trial will be resumed next Tuesday
morning at 9:30 o'clock.
CANNOT GET A
CHANCE TO TALK
__. LITTLE PLEASANTRY TN THE
CAMPAIGN.
Only OnÂ© More Week and All Doubts
Will Be Set at
Rest. .
""â "' Oakland' Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 3.
There are two unhappy candidates.
They cannot get a chance to make a
speech, and while some of their friends
[try to persuade them that they are for
tunate, others take an opposite view of it.
! These two unhappy men are D. C. Hins
dale, the Municipal League nominee for
Auditor, and L. J. Hardy, Municipal
League candidate for Councilman at
.large. These two men, not being on the
regular Republican ticket, are out in the
cold so far as campaigning is concerned.
; The Municipal League is making a cam
paign of literature, and in this manner,
of course, Mr. Hinsdale and Mr. ; Hardy
get their fair share of publicity. Every
other candidate, except perhaps for a few
minor offices, is on the Republican ticket,
and as the party is making a thorough
and lively campaign, its' candidates are
having all the opportunity they want to
get before the public. â¢
Mr. Hinsdale's opponent is Arthur H.
Breed, who was the very active chairman
of the Republican Central Committee dur
ing the campaign last fall. Mr. Breed is
' anywhere and everywhere all day long
on platforms, and wherever a coterie of
voters can be found, and seems to be
having everything his own way. .The only
other active candidate is Captain Ed
Hackett, and probably not half of the
captain's Democratic friends know that
he is on the ticket. He has not put out
a card, is not making a single effort to
ward election and once declined to accept
the nomination, but was induced to re
turn. Mr. Hinsdale's friends are conse
quently forced to place their confidence
in "the silent vote," which ls always the
solace of candidates before election and a
cause of speculation and often sorrow af
terward.
L. J. Hardy Jr. has been a library trus
tee and is not unknown in politics; but he
has an opponent in D. H. Welch from the
same ward who has the great advantage
of the Republican nomination and also of
- appearing at every Republican meeting.
He Is taking advantage of it. while his
'friend Hardy is getting in his work on
improvement clubs, buttonholing and
various other campaign tactics. The Mu
nicipal League will probably have a rally
some time next week, but no date has yet
been sent out.
Indorse the Government's Plans.'
ALAMEDA. March The City Trus
tees have addressed a letter to Major W.
H Heuer. engineer in charge of the Oak
land harbor improvements, indorsing the
Government's plans for the bridges over
'the tidal canal. The construction of two
bridges is strongly urgedâ one at Fruit
vale avenue and the other at High street.
It is recommended that the. Fruitvale
avenue bridge be built to accommodate
both railroad and wagon traffic and as
an evidence that this description of bridge
is not dangerous reference isrnad.e to the
Webster street structure, which was suc
cessfully used as a railroad and highway
bridge for over sixteen years.

School Children Are

ASSURED OF EDUCATION
â  ANXIETY ABOUT THE NEW CITY
COUNCIL.
' â V 1 -
After Being Tied Up for Nearly Two
Years the Realty Market
Feels the Effect
Quickly.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 3.
The settlement definitely of the legality
of the annexation proceedings by which
an enormous territory was added tb the
municipality of Oakland has already had
a marked effect upon improvement in the
new district.
James T. Naismlth, one of the prime
movers in the annexation proceedings,
said this morning that the re
moval of all doubt as to the rights of the
school children of the district to attend
i the public schools of Oakland that have
j been conducted in the annexed district for
j eighteen months, has even in twenty-four
I hours been the cause of closing many land
I deals that have been pending, awaiting
the Supreme Court decision.
The number of school children added to
: the school census of Oakland by the an
i nexation is as follows: Bay district, 637;
Piedmont, 196; Peralta. 146; Temescal, 532.
There has been considerable indecision re
garding prospective settlers in the new
territory .on the score of school facilities,
but now the Oakland Board of Education,
which is to be elected March 13, can un
reservedly take charge of education in the
annex and place it on a level with the |
system now in vogue in Oakland, In ad- ,
I dition to these children, quite a number
! of pupils who attend the high school and
'< manuel training school are also as
: sured of complete education In these cen
ters.
The annexed district is greatly interested
I now In the election of the new City Coun
! ell. This district has, of course, suffered
. in the way of improvements in comparison
with the amount of taxes that was paid
! into Oakland's treasury during the liti
j gation. They will now expect a few extra
' appropriations during the next fiscal year,

UNIVERSITY RESENTS WIN.
The Institution as a Corporation Is j
Qualified to Receive Sifts. ;
By a decision of the Supreme Court yesterday the standing of the
university as a public corporation capable of receiving gift, grant or de
vise was established. This is the first time that the question had been
considered, and the ruling sets forth law to insure the safety of all future
endowments as well as the gifts made in the past. The case was that of
the estate of Herman Royer, who, after bequeathing the bulk of his prop
erty to relatives, devised as follows:
"All the rest and residue of my property and estate I do hereby give,
devise and bequeath unto the University of the State of California for the
sole purpose of founding a professorship of political economy, and for no
other purpose whatever. If the said gift and devise shall for any reason
fail, the same shall revert to my next of kin."
The relatives attacked this part of the will and resisted the applica
tion of the Board of Regents, representing the university, for the amount,
$5467 10, bequeathed by Royer. The lower court found that neither the
"University of the State of California" nor the "University of Califor
nia" is now or ever has been a corporation under the laws of this State,
and is not a person; and that each is an entity distinct from the "re
gents of the University of the State of California," which latter are a
corporation duly organized under the laws of the State. The same court
also found that the residue of the estate is insufficient for the purpose of
founding a professorship of political economy, and that the gift has
failed, and by the express provisions of the will has reverted to the next
of kin of the deceased. . Hence the petition of the regents was denied and
that of the heirs for distribution was granted.
The questions Involved are of much importance, as they concern not
only the bequest in issue but previous gifts and grants, as well as the legal
status of the university. For these reasons Commissioner Chipman,
who wrote the opinion, went into the matter at considerable length. The
history of the university shows that the constitution of 1849 directed the
Legislature to take steps to dispose of such lands as had then been or
â¢might be granted by the United States or any person or persons, for the
use of a university. Provision was made for the government of the college.
The ruling body, the regents, was authorized to appoint persons "to solicit
and collect private contributions for the endowment of the university."
After following out the history of the college and its various departments
the court says:
"Throughout the entire legislation of the State the university is
spoken of as having some sort of existence, a part of which, rather than
distinct from it, are the regents." Then' the court cited many legislative
acts "for the endowment of the university," and, continuing, says:
"That the regents are by law made the governing body of the univer
sity and are required to incorporate under the laws of. the State, fs by no
means inconsistent with the continued existence of the university as a
public corporation; and the fact that the organic act in terms provides
that grants and gifts may be made to the regents and to the State and
does not provide in terms that grants and gifts may be made to the uni
versity does not in our opinion indicate that it was intended that the uni
versity was to be incapable of taking by gift, grant or devise. The or
ganic act leaves the property of the university with it, and only gives to
the regents the custody and control of it."
The court further says: "It would seem clear enough that the univer
sity comes plainly within the commonly accepted definition of a public
corporation." The point made by the lower court that the endowment
had failed because the amount is inadequate was disposed of by section
1317, C. C, which provides that where the intention of the testator "can
not have effect to its full extent, it must have effect as far as possible."

ARMSTRONG'S
FAMILY SKELETON
BROUGHT OUT
Grave Charges Made
by Aged Husband.
SENSATIONAL PROPERTY SUIT
DEEDED HIS ALL ON A DEATH
BED AND RECOVERED.
â¢
Wife Now Calls Him an "Old Irish
Chaw and Whisky Bum" and
His Life Has Been
. Threatened.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Maroh 3.
The existence of another well-developed
family skeleton ln the quiet town of Hay
wards was revealed to-day in a sensation
al suit in equity filed by Thomas C. Arm
strong, aged 60 years, against his wife,
Sarah Margaret Armstrong, wherein
plaintiff seeks to have delivered up and
canceled certain deeds.
The complaint, prepared by Attorneys
Langan and Lemos is replete with alle
gations of cruelty, ; threats against life
and the transformation of love and af
fection of a family for husband and
father to hatred and disrespect directed
against the head of the house.
According to the complaint, the parties
were married July 30, 1572, since which
time there has been acquired and ls now
owned by the community of plaintiff and
defendant real estate at Haywards valued
at Sl4 000. the annual rental income being
$905; also nine lots in the Armstrong tract
valued at $2000, bringing an annual reve
nue of $50; also an undivided one-third
interest in real estate at Fourth and
Bryant streets, San Francisco, valued at
$2000, which one-third interest brings in
annually $160.
Since the marriage Mrs. Armstrong also
acquired by devise from her father, the
late John Martin, forty acres in Eden
Township, valued at $16,000, being her sep
arate property, and from which she an
nually receives a revenue of $400.
The family consists of the principals,
two daughters, Margaret C. and Lottie
Armstrong, aged 25 and 19 years respec
tively, and a son, Samuel P. Armstrong,
aged 23 years, all of whom resided to
gether in peace and harmony up to No
vember 12, 189". though the incipiency of
the family estrangement began on June
14. 1897.
On the latter date plaintiff was sick
nigh unto death and his attending physi
cian, Dr. G. E. Reynolds, advised him to
adjust his earthly and financial matters
in contemplation of death. Several deeds
to the property, conveying plaintiff's com
munity interest, amounting to about $10,
--000. and a bill of sale of his personal prop
erty were prepared upon the urgent and
continued solicitations of the wife and
children. However, Mr. Armstrong ral
lied for a time and did not sign the deeds.
On November 11 following, while again

ill, and in fear of death, he signed and
acknowledged them berore James A. Col
lins, a Notary Public, and the documents
were placed in a bureau drawer, plaintiff
not intending to deliver them as yet. The
very next day, according to the com
plaint, -the deeds were taken without the
knowledge or consent of plaintiff and re
corded. The alleged miserable existence
of plaintiff is then related in the com
plaint as follows: , â â â *'-
"Since then the defendant has treated
plaintiff with disrespect, cruelty, calling
him a tramp, ordering him to leave the
house and earn his own living; refusing
him proper care and food; instigated the
children to treat him with disrespect and
Eoisoning and prejudicing the mind of
amuel P. Armstrong until he has fre
qucntlv threatened to strike him. Within
five days after the recording of the deeds
defendant said to plaintnf: 'Get out of
here, you old loafer. I'll not support you,
and calling him 'an old Irish chaw'; also
'a whisky bum.' " .
Continuing, the complaint alleges that
the son accused the father with being
drunk and not sick at all, and that in
July last the daughter, Margaret C. Arm
strong, said to plaintiff: "If I re -,_
man I'd kill you. If I had a knife Id
run it through you. You have robbed
my mother and have robbed us all. You
are keeping other women. I know you
are spending your money for another wo
man and are staying out late at nights
with other women."
Plaintiff also avers that his wife ut
tered the following expression to neigh
bors: "Now, I've got my old fool Just
where I want him. I've got all his prop
erty and whenever I get ready I'll kick
him out." And that on January 15, 189.,
Samuel, the son, threatened to kill him.
He also avers that since the recording of
the deeds his tenants refused and still
refuse to pay him rents, and that he is
now old and feeble and unable to work.
Plaintiff asks that the deeds be can
celed and that he be granted such other
relief as may seem meet and agreeable to
equity.
THOMAS A. SMITH
PASSES AWAY
Was a Prominent Pioneer
of Alameda.
ALAMEDA, March 3.â Thomas A. j
Smith, a pioneer of Alameda County and j
an early resident of this city, died this '
morning at his home, 2304 Buena Vista j
avenue. He was taken ill with pneumonia
early in November, and later was at- j
tacked with dropsy. His death had been
expected daily tor nearly three months,
and on several occasions the report had
spread that he had passed away.
Deceased was born at Sparta, Hancock
County, Ga., April 6, 1835. He came to
California in 1850. For nearly two years ;
he followed mining at Big - Oak Flat,
Tuolumne County, when he returned to :
San Francisco and entered upon the study I
of law in the office of Sloan & Rhodes.
Failing health, however, forced him to !
abandon his chosen profession, and in 1853 ,
he moved to Alameda, then known as the \
Encinal of San Antonio. He engaged in |
farming until 1864, when he established i
the first general merchandise store ln Ala- j
meda. He continued this until 1868, when i
he engaged in the real estate business, ]
which he followed until he was stricken i
with his last sickness.
Mr. Smith occupied many positions or
public trust in Alameda County. In 1858
he was elected Justice of the Peace of ,
Alameda Township, and during his incum- ;
bency was chosen one of the last Asso
ciate Justices of the Court of Sessions. i
He was the first Treasurer of the town of
Alameda, was clerk of the Town Trustees
in 1579 and later was elected a member of
that body. In 1876 he was elected Re
corder of Alameda County on the Demo
cratic ticket. Upon the death of City !
Treasurer N. W. Palmer in 1890 Mr. Smith
was appointed to fill the unexpired term.
He refused to be a candidate for the of
flee at the following election and retired
from public life. He was one of the
founders of Christ Episcopal Church, and .
was a vestryman and senior warden from
the date of its organization.
Deceased leaves a widow and one son, I
Clifford, aged 11 years. His estate, which
consists principally of realty holdings, is
estimated to be worth $30,000. The funeral ,
services will be held Sunday at Christ
Episcopal Church.

THE UNIVERSITY TOWN.
The Basket Ball Team Will Compete i
With Stockton.
BERKELEY, March 3.â The University '<
basket ball team left this afternoon for j
Stockton to play a match game with the ;
girls of the Stockton High School, sched- j
uled to come off to-morrow. It will be
the third contest of the season in which '
the co-eds have taken part, they having
already met the young ladles of Miss
West's school and of Mills College, In â 
both cases the game was carried off by
the blue and gold. It is understood, how
ever, that Stockton has an unusually good
te,am for a high school, so that the college
girls expect the game to be a close one.
California will line up as follows:
Guards. Miss Alma Stockwell, Miss May
Haworth, Miss Ella Stockwell; forwards.
Miss A. Kelshaw, Miss E. Stoer, Miss A. !
Farno; centers. Miss S. Hanscom, Miss G. \
Longmore. Miss L. Linscott. Miss Lulu
Rued, Miss T. V. Kavanaugh and Miss
Edith B. Catton are to accompany the
team as substitutes.
The sophomore class met at students'
hour this morning to consider nominations
for 1901's Blue and Gold. The list of can
didates in the Held for manager and editor
in chief was very small, only two men be- \
ing proposed for each office. Paul Sin
sheimer and Walter Frickstad will contest
the election for the honors of the editorial
chair. For managing the financial part .
of the book the class will choose between !
T. H. Emerson and A. B. Tarpey. The
election has been ordered for next Monday
afternoon. â¢â '.__â¢-â "
A very successful entertainment was
given in Shattuck Hall this evening under
the auspices of the junior class for the
purpose of raising funds for 1900's Blue
and Gold. The programme * consisted of
several well rendered musical numbers by
members of the class and a stereopticon
exhibition of University views by A. V.
Lange. *.

TREPHINED HIS SKULL.
Young Haanstra Undergoes an Opera
tion and His Assailant's Bail
Is Raised.
OAKLAND, March 3.â Harry Rogers,
the driver for the Quaker doctors, who is
charged with having battered young Fred
Haanstra on the head with a revolver
in a street riot last Wednesday, and who
was yesterday released on $50 bail, is
again in custody. His ball has been raised
to $200 and a more serious charge may bo
placed against him.
This was done because young Haan
stra's condition has proved more serious
than was at first found when examined
at the Receiving Hospital. The wound on
the boy's head was sewed up and he was j
sent home yesterday morning, but last
night he was taken back to the hospital I
and Drs. Stratton, Horn and Rowe dis
covered a fracture of the skull and found
it necessary- to trephine the skull, which
has now been successfully accomplished.
The lad's condition, however, is still seri
ous. ;.'.'

SNATCHED THE
TRANSFER FROM
HIS GRASP
Policeman Mulcahey
in More Trouble.
BULLDOZES A YOUNG MAN
THE COMMISSIONERS TO BE TODD
OF HIS CONDUCT.
â 
He Is Not Content With Browbeating
Respectable Citizens, but Tries
ito Suppress Industrious
Newsboys.
Policeman Mulcahey, whose blundering
methods form an Interesting chapter in
the book of errors of the Police Depart
ment, has once more demonstrated his
unfitness for the position which he occu
pies. Not content with bulldozing respect
able citizens by refusing to allow them to
stand in the vicinity of Eddy and Powell
streets, this officious "copper" has de
clared war against the newsboys who
deal in transfers as an incentive to the
purchase of their papers.
Last evening a young man named
George W. Cooney, who is employed at
the Vulcan Iron Works, boarded a street
car near where he is employed. He was
given a transfer to the Market street line,
and after alighting at Eddy street he was
accosted by a colored newsboy, who asked
him for the transfer. As Cooney intended
to wait for a friend, he gave the transfer
to the boy. The mighty Mulcahey wit
nessed the act, and, walking over to the
colored boy, he demanded the transfer.
Thinking that he intended to arrest him,
the boy passed the transfer back to
Cooney. With an oath, Mulcahey snatched
the transfer from Cooney's hand and tore
it in pieces. Cooney attempted to ex
postulate with the officer, but the latter
ordered him away, under penalty of being
given an enforced ride in the patrol
wagon. Cooney afterward visited the
Central station, where he told his story
to the officer in charge. To-day he in
tends to prefer charges against Mulcahey
with the Board of Police Commissioners.
Sergeant Martin has been repeatedly
told of Mulcahey's seemingly tyrannical
methods, but for some reason he allows
him to browbeat and humiliate respec
table citizens who happen to visit his
beat.
Several months ago Mulcahey, who
boasts of his pull with Captain Wlttman,
while on his way home saw a boy look
ing at the number of a house. Convinced
that he was a burglar Mulcahey, always
anxious to make a record, drew his re
volver and sneaking up behind him or
dered him to throw up his hands.
The boy becoming alarmed took to his
heels, followed by the "Drave" police
man. Failing to overtake him Mulcahey
fired at the boy, the bullet fortunately
passing harmlessly over his head. Throw
ing up his arms the thoroughly frightened
boy dropped on his knees and begged the
big policeman not to shoot again. Mul
cahey took the boy to police headquarters,
where he established his identity and was
allowed to go. Mulcahey was roundly
scored at the time by Captain Wittman
for his conduct.

LOCAL SPORTS
Lowered the Colors of
Dal Hawkins.
FINISH WAS A KNOCKOUT
{THE END CAME QUICKLY IN THE
SEVENTH ROUND.
Marvelous Cleverness of the East
erner Prevented Dal From Land
ing His Famous Left
Swing.
The patrons of fistic entertainment wit
nessed a contest last evening at Wood
ward's Pavilion which years will not
efface from the memory.
Pal Hawkins, the flower of the light
weight champions representative of this
coast, met .Frank Erne, the clever two
handed pugilist of Buffalo, N. V.. In
what was to have been a twenty-round
pugilistic contest. The local sports
pinned their faith on "Hawkins, who has
a record of winning many hard battles
against the crackerjacks of the class of
fighters of which he is a representative.
The betting favored Hawkins from
start to finish, or, in other words, Haw
kins was the favorite from the time the
pools opened until they closed. The
betting was 10 to S. with Hawkins on the
long end, and before the contestants en
tered the ring Erne's stock took a tum
ble as odds of $10 to $7 went without
takers. When Hawkins landed a swift
left-hander on Erne's eye in the first
round the effect of which brought the
receiver to the carpet, the news of Haw
kins* success swept like wildfire about
Characters Seen at the Ringside.
town, and when it reached the pool- i
rooms the supporters of the local man
were jubilant, and the Erne money fell â 
from $10 to $7 to $10 to $4. and even at
these latter figures Eastern money was
hard to got.
The sudden defeat of Hawkins was a
great surprise to the local talent, and It i
Is safe to say that many a "hard-earned
pocket" I els to-day the result of last
evening's entertainment at Woodword's
Pavilion. , , Â I
â  The contest was a particularly bril- |
liant oneâ that is, from a scientific point j
of view In the first round Haw_ins
came within a few inches of bringing the
-.port to a very sudden conclusion. After i
the usual fiddling and sparring for open- l
Ings Hawkins swung his dangerous left ;
and his glove landed hard on the right i
eye of Erne. The force of the blow sent !
the Eastern lad to the carpet, where he ,
remained for eight seconds. But. cau
tious and cool as Erne is. he took the j
limit of time to collect his senses, and was
up and at it again before Referee !
Choynski had time to call him out.
Erne saw that another such punch as
he received if landed on the right spot
would quickly end the disturbance and
cunningly he remained on the defensive,
handsomely blocking all left swings that
were afterward Intended for the jaw
no'nt. Hawkins was rapidly scoring points
on his adversary and the admirers of
Erne freely confessed that unless the
Buffalo man had "something up his
sleeve" for future use Hawkins would
win on points if he failed to score a
knockout. In the seventh round Erne,
advised by Barney Feeney, changed his
tactics and Instead of making a long
range fight, which was favorable to Haw
kins he got under the local man's guard
and 'forced a mi-cup at short range. Dal,
who is only what ls called a one-hand
fighter, attempted to ward off the attack
of his opponent, but Erne, who is a llght
ning-quick striker, had Dal at sea imme
diately, and in the mixup he landed a
hard left jolt on Dai's Jaw, which was
followed by a sharp right-hand crook,
also on the jaw point, the force of which
ended all dispute as to the fighting abili
ties of the men. Hawkins fell on his back
and remained dead to the world for some
seconds after being counted out.
The police management of the fight, un
der the command of Captain James W.
Gillen of the Seventeenth street station,
was as perfect as it was possible to have
it All the passageways were kept clear
and the utmost good order was main
-lined throughout the entire building.

harmlessly on his arms. He retaliated
with one good swift punch on Dal s wish
bone. Hawkins rushed him to the ropes,
but Erne clinched and no harm was done.
Hawkins kept up the leading in the
third round, with Erne warding off all the
blows and suffering no punishment, save
one which Hawkins swung into his side,
leaving a large red blotch to denote the
spot where it landed.
Hawkins tried his left swing several
times unsuccessfully in the fourth. Erne
showed great cleverness in warding them
off. Hawkins then tried his right, land
ing lightly on the body. Erne returned
with a swift right In Dai's side. In a
rush both exchanged lefts and rights on
the head and shoulders as the round end
ed, and went to their corners winded.
Hawkins increased the size of the red
spot on Erne's side in the fifth round by
landing several hard left swings, -which
Erne did not guard. Erne did not try a
return, contenting himself with avoiding
punishment and gauging his man.
Erne showed more confidence in the
sixth, opening with a rush and forcing
Dal to clinch. Hawkins landed a light
left on the forehead and again in the
side, and Erne came back at him with
hot rights and lefts on the head that
dazed the Californian. It was the hot
test exchange of the fight thus far.
Hawkins began hostilities in the sev
enth and what proved to be the last
round by rushing his man to the ropes,
swinging his left into Erne's side again.
Erne retaliated with a hard right swing
which landed on the back of. Hawkins*
neck. Erne rushed Hawkins to the ropes,
landing his left and right hard on the
head. Hawkins clinched and backed
away, and Erne, following him up, swung
his left and right across Dai's jaw so
Quickly that Hawkins probably never
knew they. were coming. The blows set
tled Hawkins, probably, but just to show
that there was no frost Erne soaked him
a straight left in the jaw and a right
swing on the side of the head, and Dal
went down like a log. falling straight
backwards and hitting His head a re
sounding thump on the floor. He lay
stretched there without moving a muscle
after the referee counted him out, and
his seconds had to carry him bodily from
the ring. . "
Erne was the favorite with the Eastern
contingent, and they crowded around him
after the battle and showered, their con
gratulations, which he received modestly.
Erne comes far from giving any one the
impression that he is a prize-fighter,
though when stripped he is a perfectly
built athlete. Among those who know
him he Is a quiet, good-looking, curly
haired youth, who might easily be mis
taken for a college man. He has litttle
to say, and nothing when it comes to
speaking of his own achievements. "When
he wins a battle the money gained is not
spent in drink or on the races. He has
no use for these vices, and says that if
he can find some suitable employment he
will retire from the prize-ring and devote
his time to something more elevating.
He was born in Zurich. Switzerland,
twenty-four years ago, but was raised ln
Buffalo, N. Y. which place he calls his
home. .'..--%-..<
The preliminary event of the evening
was to have been a ten-round go between
Charles Johnson and Eugene Mulligan,
both of this city, in the lightweight class.
Both were wild and showed little science.
After six rounds Mulligan had enough,
and made a weak pretense at being un
able to arise after slipping to the floor
from a light body blow. He destroyed the
illusion, however, by jumping up quickly
after the referee had counted him out
and walking briskly to his corner Tor
this little exhibition of cowardice he was
loudly hissed as he left the ring, and the
crowd showed its further de reca s lon w Â«,
veiling "fake." which statement was
probably well grounded. Ned Hogan ref
ereed the unsatisfactory bout.

"After the first round." he added, I

lefts of his clever opponent. Dal was
loth to talk about the outcome of the
battle. He did say, however, that Erne
was a top notcher and won on his merits.
Hawkins said he was confident that he
would win and stated he intended fighting
faster after the tenth round. "I thought
I had him In the first round," he said,
"but I caught him too high. I think I

Suited TTUxillo â An Off
Day at Oakland.
The card at Oakland yesterday was not
a prepossessing one, and the attendance
-was the lightest of the week. Of six
favorites sent to the post four were re
turned winners. Dare 11, an 8 to 1 shot,
and Tom Calvert, at equally long odds,
proved the surprises. The track was very
heavy in spots, especially near the rail.
The underpinning of Truxlllo is not of
the. best, and the stable figured that the
going would be just to his liking. The
bay horse closed favorite for the opening
six furlong scramble and won by him
self. Festoso. a rank outsider, earned
I place honors over Mainbar, another long
j priced one. Campus, the second choice,
made no showing. , V. . -

I most of the way the daughter of Favor
dale shook off Wlnyah in the run home,
| scoring with ease. Thorpe, on Giga,
| picked out the deep footing, finishing
j third.
The defeat of Mistral II ln the seven
j furlong run was a body blow to the tal-
I ent. The Imported horse closed at odds
I of 3 to 5 and. never showing much speed,
I was badly beaten by Tom Calvert. The
I latter, piloted by Eddie Jones, drew away
from the bunch on the back stretch, win
ning eased up. Coda finished in the show.
The Baldwin stable furnished the favor
ite for the six furlong spin following In
El Salado. The good looking mare was
held at a short price in the books and led
Colonial Dame over the line with consid
erable to spare. Distinction, after cut
! ting quite a figure ln the running, was
I only downed ln a drive for the place.
: There was a well defined play on Anno

I crn horse cut a sorry figure.
It appeared that Sloan & Hurst's
! horse. Dare 11, finally found a spot where
I the track conditions and weight were fa
-1 vorable. He was backed down from 8 to
i 4 to 1 to capture the mile and a quarter
i run and did it in clever fashion, stepping
: the distance off in 2:12 flat. Espionage,
; the favorite, ridden in inimitable style by
i Hal Brown, ran second. Although the
: field was a small one Devln, astride Ma
i lav, the second choice, found all the pock
ets possible and was probably fortunate

Track Notes.
Jockey Johnny Woods will leave early

I been engaged to ride for an English firm.
; He is a good judge of pace and should

Ed Richardson, the old-time Sierra Val-
I ley stage-driver, ls down from Truckee,
I and visited the track N yesterday. Ed' Is
used to making short turns and soon
caught on to the curves of the game.
The big Chase & Mendenhall sale will
i take place in the Oakland track paddock
at noon to-day. Tom Ryan will sell thÂ©
record-breaker Dunols, Goal Runner, a
very fast sprinter, Al, The Wooer, Mont
allade and Don't Skip Me. Prince Blazes
and Dare 11, the property of Sloan &
Hurst, will also pass under the hammer.
P. Ryan will send the crack performer
First Call into the ring.
Cash Sloan rendered a bill to the Judges
yesterday of the money he claims Is due
him from Fred Foster. The stand has
the matter under consideration.
John W. Palmer, a starter in the open
ing event, was backed from 100 to 1 down
to 10 with such a rush that the rumor
gained credence that the horse was a
ringer. He was the cynosure of all eyes
in the paddock and finished among the
"also rans."

FIREMEN VS. STANFORD.
Will Line Up for the First Time This
Season in This City.
The Fireman's Fund and the two col- |
lege teams have been playing some very
close games since the beginning of their
schedule, but hitherto the matches were
on the college grounds. To-day for the
first time this season the Stanford and
Firemen will be seen in this city.
They will meet this afternoon at the
Recreation Grounds, Eighth and Harri
son streets. Stanford has not won a game
from the Firemen, while California has
been successful in all their dual engage
ments with the insurance men. It does
not follow that Stanford is a weaker team
than the Californians. Those who have |
watched both nines play say that they
are evenly matched, and that when the j
time comes for the intercollegiate games
there will be some hot battles on the
tapis. ;--<...;
The teams will line up this afternoon
in the following positions:

INTERRUPTED BRIDAL FEAST
A MOURNED-FOR LOVER'S UN
EXPECTED RETURN.
Attorney for Defendant Handled
Plaintiff's Case Against His
Own Interests, but Still
for His Client.
Virginia Magallon was granted a di
vorce from Marion Magallon by Judge
Daingerfield yesterday morning on the
ground of infidelity. The wife just freed
from the galling bonds of matrimony will
leave shortly for the Klondike to wed
Frank Pidgeon. and in the far northern
home _ the name of Marion . Magallon
will be mentioned but with reverence by
husband, and wife alike, who will never
cease to remember the, noble man who
made their wedded happiness possible.
Five years ago Virginia Rieffel, Frank
Pidgeon and Marion Magallon were Insep
arable friends. Miss Rieffel and Pidgeon
were engaged to be married, and Magallon
was the only one besides the lady's fam
ily who was allowed to share their happy
secret. After the engagement had extend-
Ed over the period of a year Pidgeon left
for the Alaskan gold fields in the hope of
amassing a fortune for the fair young
girl he hoped soon to make his wife. He
promised to write daily, and the lovers
parted happy in the thought of their be
ing soon reunited.
Time .passed but no letters came from
the frozen north. No messages of love
reached the girl. Her missives of tender
affection remained unanswered. There
was but one conclusion to be reachedâ
Pidgeon in trying to conquer dazzling for
tune had encountered grim death.
Magallon proved a tender comforter in
those days, and the love born of pity and
sympathy was soon throbbing in both
young hearts.
On September 4. 1898, Virginia Rieffel
and Marion Magallon were married at the
French Catholic Church, Notre Dame dcs
Victoires, on Bush street. Innumerable
tapers made bright the altar and flowers
bloomed everywhere. After the ceremony
there was a bridal banquet at the home
of the bride's parents, 5 Marcy avenue,
to which a large company was bidden.
The health of the newly wedded couple
was just being pledged when an unexpect
ed-guest appeared. Frank Pidgeon, come
back to claim his bride, stood, worn and
travel stained, ln the midst of the merry
gathering. '
The health of the newly wed couple was
never drunk. The wine remained un
tasted. The Joy of the guests was turned
to alarmâ fear for the pale young bride
who had swooned away and could not be
restored to consciousness.
For two days the young wife hovered
between life and death and then cruel
consciousness returned. Her husband
was the first one to be admitted to her
presence. While the physicians were
battling for the young wife, the husband
had been forming his plans to make that
life worth living. These plans he ex

plained to the girl who wedded him.
With two witnesses he started from the
home he would never more return to and
gave his followers proof of the infidelity
that would set his bride free.
With evidence furnished by her hus
band, Virginia Magallon appeared in court
yesterday morning to free herself from
the man she, esteemed aoove all others,
so she might wed the man she loved. On
account of illness. Mr. Magallon's attor
ney was absent, but Abe Ruef, attorney
for defendant, handled both sides, taking
charge of the plaintiff's case against his
own interests, but still in the interest of
his client, whose wish it was that the
woman who bore his name should be left
free to wed the man of her choice.
Mrs. Magallon, who is. but 23 years of
age, will shortly leave with her sister for
the Klondike, where there is no law that
compels lovers with a divorce standing
between them to wait a year before the.
again embrace matrimony.

COURSING AT INGLESIDE.
Lively coursing will be witnessed to-day
at Ingleside Coursing Park, with seventy
two nominations ln the open stake and
sixteen In the puppies. In glancing over
the list of dogs the most notable in the
bunch of flyers are two of the Merced
candidates for honors, namely, Regina
and Tommy Rex; and the long tail that
can defeat either one will have to burn
grass pretty lively on the Ingleside cours
ing sward. Curtis & Sons have no less
than six nominations In this stake, all
of whom are dogs of the first flight. The
grand bitch Maud S, the winner of sec
ond money on Sunday last, is entered in
this stake also. Mr. Curtis' dogs are
always brought to the slips In perfect
condition, and the public can wager their
coin on them with a degree of confidence.

Not, Old Glory. Johnnie R, Thornhill,

Chloe and several other good dogs will
meet to-day. The first race on the card,
between American Eagle and Prince
George, will certainly cause much excite
ment among the crowd, as the dogs are
very nearly matched in speed and staying
qualities. The courses that may land
short enders on top will be the ones be
tween Lawrence and Royal Buck, Fedora
and Hadiwist, Black Bess and Lissak,
Hummer and Maid of Erin, Arab and
Maid of the Hill. Cavalier and Twin City

Tim Cronin has entered three of his
crack runners, and his chances of land
ing a winner are very favorable. Mr. Cro
nln's nominations were not accepted at
the last drawing of the Union Coursing
Park Association on the ground that
he (Cronin) had impugned the decision
of Judge Bull, who decided in favor of
Mr. Rosslter's dog For Freedom as
against Thornhill in the final course of
last Sunday's meeting at Union Park.
Mr. Cronin has been notified to appear
before the directors of Union Park at
their next meeting and explain why ha
disputed the decision of Judge Bull,
whose judgment is always final. Cronln
has stated that he watched the course
from a favorable position in the cours
ing field and that Thornhill defeated For
.Freedom handily, scoring several points
more than the English dog. When the
decision was rendered in favor of For
Freedom Cronin informed Rossiter that
the judge must certainly have made a
mistake, as For Freedom did not run
up to his former style and was beaten
beyond all doubt.
The Waterloo cup was won this year
by Black Fury. Mad Fury-Mischief, "and
Fortuna Farenta was the runner up.
