"There is no question of the
wealth of the new district
have seen the gold. It is coming
out of the country in a steady
stream, and there is plenty yet to
come." â Extract from an inter
view with a recent arrival from the
new placers in Lower California.
<Â»S ANGELES, May 27.â C. C.
LPursley, a mining man. has ar
rived here after a stay of eight
een months in Lower Califor-
nia and gives glowing accounts
of the wealth of the new placer dig
i in the San Rogue district, 300
miles south of Knsenada.
"1 have been prospecting in the coun
try for a ]'>nX time," he said this morn
ing, "but have only lately paid atten
tion to anything but quartz. I have
ral claims in th>- new diggings and
â will return to-morrow to look after
them; they are worth lev. iking after,
he gold is there. Some of the dirt,
good deal of it, runs $20 to the
yard, and the who]-, district is wonder
fully rich. The gold is coarse and the
gravel contains a world of nuggets,
than I ever saw in any other
:â  diggings. In fact, many of them
are as large as marbles. The diggings
are really not new, having been worked
in a haphazard manner by the Indians
for nearly 200 years. The secret of the i
rich diggings was known to few if any
le of the Mexicans and Indians on
the spot, and they say little or nothing.
"There is no question of the weaJth of
the new district. I have seen the gold.
It is coming out of the country in a
ty stream, and there is plenty yet
me."
Speaking of the lack of -water. Mr.
Pursley said that it could be found
nearly anywhere in the district a few j
feel below the surface, and added, what
will be of interest to the man with
little money, that the country was one
of the cheapest in the world in which
to live. He is enthusiastic over the new
field and says it is a "first-class all
round proposition."
J. It. Southworld, who has just re
turned from Knsenada, says that ho
was informed by Don Ismael Sanchez.
ral [nspector of Colonies, that the
Sierra Pintada placers were twenty
eight miles in length and sixteen miles
wide. They run in a northwesterly and
southeasterly direction. On the east
ern side of the range, according to the
inspector, new placers have been found
that have not yet been prospected be

CROWDING THE STEAMSHIPS.
Gold Seekers Eager to Engage Pas
sage From San Diego.
SAX DIEGO. May 27.â There will be
a rush to the big placers of the Sierra
Pintada Range in spite of everything.
More attention was paid to the mines
to-day in this city than yesterday, and
yesterday witnessed more excitement
than on the day previous. Interest in
the diggings continues to increase. T'n
lesa something unexpected happens
Monday will witness even greater ex
cltement and more names enrolled on
the lists <>f schooners and steamers
f-'">n to sail for Ascension Ray. Late
this evening Manager Packard of the
Lower *'a!ifornia Development Com
pany telegraphed to Agent Louis Men
> delson in this city that the steamer St.
Denis would sail from San Diego for
Ascension on June 1 and that berths up
tn the full limit of the steamer could
bf> .s< i]d. The St. Denis has accommoda
tions for thirty-five first-class passen
gers and Agent Mendelson says sev
eral hundred tickets, for Ascension
could be sold if there were adequate
transportation facilities. He is receiving
telegraphic and telephone inquiries
from all over the southern part of the
State from men who desire passage to
Ascension.
The fact that Manager Packard has
ordered the St. Denis to sail from here
for Ascension on June 1 is taken to in
<li< -: 1 1 * - that favorable news has been
Ived .it Bnsenada from the mines,
though hi- s;tid nothing about it in his
telegram to Agent Mendelson.
The schooner Santa Barbara, which
is expected to bring definite and full
Information concerning the placers, is
.-ilxiut due at Ensenada, but up to 5:20
O'clock this evening, when the tele
grapfa office at Ensenada closed, she had
nol put in an appearance. It is not im
probable, however, that the Santa Bar
bara put in at San Quintin this even
ing, and that news of her was received
at ESnsenada by telephone from San
Quintin. The telegraph office at En
senado is not open at night.
k It is considered as suggestive of good
news that the schedule of the St. Denis
h;is been changed so as to send her
down on the Ist instead of the 13th, as

Cuban soldiers applied for their '
Cuban soldiers applied tor their -
share of the $3,000,000 provided
JL JL by the United States at the dis
tributing station here to-day.
Seven were paid. Three were not on
the list and one was not identified.
None turned over his arms, five out of
the seven having been servants in the
army. The other two said they had
given their arms to General Gomez. :
Colonel Randall took their word for
this, asking for no receipt. Colonel
Randall seemed inclined not to attach
much importance to the disposition of
the arms, saying that if the men could
prove they had been in the army in
any capacity he would pay them.
The distribution office remained open
until 5 o'clock this afternoon. At 6
o'clock nine soldiers with rifles applied
for money and were told to come to
morrow. Colonel Cespedes says the
soldiers are not thoroughly informed as
to the time and place of distribution,
and he expects a larger number 'will
accept the money to-morrow and give
up their arms.
The society of Veterans of Independ
ence, which is anti-Gomez, claims a
great victory to-night. Its members
say that nine-tenths of the whole army
will refuse the money, and go home
with their arms. General Gomez is us
ing every effort to have the soldiers
disarm. He tells them to refuse the
money if they wish, but to return home
as peaceful citizens.
He is writing a proclamation calling
on all residents of the island, Cubans
and Spaniards, to unite and work for
Cuban independence.
Colonel Randall has 4317 names of sol
diers to receive money at this distribut
ing station. He says it is doubtful if
fifty respond. As yet the Cubans have
not turned over any arms to the Mayors
or the civil Governor of this province.
The soldiers at Guanabacoa and Ma
tanzas are making preparations to-day

noon at 4 o'clock, arriving at Ascen

WOODLAND. May 27.â Henry Ramko
committed suicide by hanging on the By

strangle himself, and the deed was con
summated in one of the big barns on the
place. He. evidently stood upon an or
dinary fruit box to throw the rope over a
beam and adjust it about his neck, as the
1 box was found just back of him and his
feet were within three, or four inches of
i the ground. When found he had evidently
I been dead about an hour and his body was
not yet cold. He was dressed in his work-
Ing clothes, and his hat was picked up
from the floor of the barn. There was no
evidence of any struggle.
In one of his pockets was found a note.
It was not addressed to any particular
person. The first sentence read. "I'm
tired of living; please don't think me
crazy." Then followed some writing
which was not intelligible. The conclud

THE CUBANS MUST
SURRENDER ARMS
If They Do Not Take Money Now
They Will Be Given
Nothing.
NEW VnKK, May 27. A Washington
special to the Herald says: Little ron
cern is felt in administration circles at
the failure of the Cubans to appear be
fore the American authorities and re
ceive In exchange for their arms and
equipments the $75 allotted them as a
result of the conference getween Gener
als Brooke and Gomez. The equanimity
of the authorities over the matter is en
tirely due to a dispatch recently re
â¢i from Genera] Brooke General
Brooke stated in this message that If
the Cubans did not care to accept the
money he would send it promptly back
to the United States and that he felt
sure he could take eat" of the situation
â¢ yen if the tnen did retain their arms.
Satisfied with Genera] Brooke's confi
dence, the authorities are not at all dis
turbed by the reports of the failure of
the <"Ã¼bans to appear. The explanation
that but few of the enlisted men of the
Cuban army live in Havana is regarded
by officials as the sole reason for their
failure to put in an appearance and
collect the gratuity due them.
Another reason, perhaps, why th" au
thorities are satisfied that there will be
no trouble is the fact that this Govern
ment has an excellent force in the is
land which, even in case of refusal of
the insurants to turn in their arms,
could handle them.
Should General Brooke find it neces
sary to return the money to the Vnited
States it is expected he will take meas
ures for relieving the Cubans of their
arms and equipments and they will re
ceive nothing in return for them.

a force of men employed in the orchard.
He was a very industrious man and appa

his duties. He was a man of fair intel
ligence and talked rationally on all sub
jects except one. He seemed to harbor a
fear that people would believe him crazy,

that the police were trying to appre

Hecke's conversations with him did not
impress him with the idea that this hal

thing desperate.
Mr. Hecke last saw Ramke alive about
8 o'clock Friday evening. He was appa
rently in his usual health and spirits.
Ramke arose from.bed about 3:30 clock
this morning. Other laborers who slept
in the same apartments inquired why he
was getting up so early. He replied that
he had three horses to care for, which
made it necessary for him to get out
early. At fifteen minutes past 5 the men
were called to breakfast. Ramke did
not put in an appearance. After waiting
a few minutes Mr. Hecke concluded to in

a brief search -the unfortunate man was

firm what is already pretty well j
understood at the Vatican â that
Tcherikof, Russian Minister to
the Holy See, will not return to
Rome, and if the Czar's present
temper continues he will not be
represented at the Vatican again.
Before leaving on a so-called six
months' leave Tcherikof had an i
audience with the Pope. For
several months previously he
vainly asked for an audience, but
no notice was taken of his re
quests.
Finally he bluntly inquired of
Cardinal Rampolla what it
meant, and the Papal Secretary
of State informed him that as the
Czar ignored the Pontiff's sover
eign rights by omitting to ask
him to send delegates to the dis
armament, conference, his Holi
ness did not feel called .upon to
receive his Majesty's representa
tive, fcherikof thereupon in-
I formed his Government that his
I position was intolerable and
: begged to be recalled. The result
was the six months' leave.
ARBITRATION URGED
BY THE ENGLISH
LONDON. May 27. â The holidays
have brt-ught stagnation in politics.
Most of public attention has been di
rected to The Hague Peace Conference
and the Anglo-American Commission.
The papers warmly approve of the
unison <>f tho work with the American
and British delegates at the confer
ence, and interest in it. is quickened by i
the prominence unexpectedly given to
the arbitration question, especially in
view of M. de Staal's speech revising j
the arder of the points submitted from j
that <>f the circular of the Russian j
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count
Muravieffe, giving arbitration the first
place and making only a minor refer
'â n<-<' to disarmament, .which was at
first blazoned as the main purpose of
the conference. The Czar's scheme,
presented on Friday, is very elaborate
and detailed, while the American pro
ject is attractive by its businesslike
brevity and simplicity. The Daily News
correspondent at The Hague says it ap
pears to give a satisfactory solution
of the problom presented by the Czar,
and that Great Britain, of course, will
support the American pro-ject.
The scheme of Professor Maartens,
professor of international law at the
University of St. Petersburg and arbi
trator of the Anglo-Venezuelan Arbi
tration Commission is said to contain
the code of procedure which will be
adopted by the Venezuelan arbitration
tribunal at any rate. Three of the five
judges have decided to conduct the
trial under its rule when the tribunal
meets in Paris.
Referring to the proposal which the
American delegates are now pressing to
exempt all private property at sea from
capture, the Daily Chronicle presents
the British view in saying: "The mat
ter is grave. As many contend, Great
Britain yielded more than was wise
when she accepted even the Paris rule.
However, the House of Commons has
always declined to countenance any
idea of withdrawal, and if America will
come in and sign the declaration, which
she practically invoked in the Spanish
war, it will be a material advance in
the humanizing of war, and England
might well reaffirm the rule and abso
lutely bind herself in the future."
THAMES ENTRANCE
RAPIDLY CHOKING UP
Alarming Discovery Made That Ships

LONDON, May 27.â Another very
alarming discovery has just been made
public. It is that the entrance to the
Thames is choking up and that all the
power of man cannot stop it. This is no
fairy tale invented by an alarmist by the
aid of juggling with figures, but is a
hard, cold fact, published In the annual
report of the admiralty hydrographers,
which says that the Duke of Edinburgh
Chancel, which is the principal passage
int/i the Thames for heavy vessels, has
Hi nee ls^L* been reduced from one and a
i half t<> half a mile. The Trinity House
authorities are very much exercised about
the matter, which it is admitted cannot
be controlled by works, and thus arises
the question, what will London do without
the Thames or the shipping that it brings?

NEGROTES ACCEPT
AMERICAN RULE
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 18W, by James Gor

MANILA, May 27. â President Lacson
and the members of the Cabinet of the
insurrectionists on the island of Negros
have signed and issued a proclamation,
fully accepting the constitution pre
pared by General Smith's commission,
acting in conjunction with themselves.
The constitution is similar to that
which had been offered to the warring
Filipinos on the island of Luzon. The
Instrument confers upon the people the
power of electing executive and judicial
officers and .members of the legislative
branches. The proclamation concludes
thus:
"We are thus governed by ourselves
under the wise guidance of the great
American Republic. To all the inhabit
ants of the Island of/ Negros is given
equality before the law."
It is believed that tlje island will set
tle down peacefully under the new
regime.
ADVENTURER SLAIN AND
MUTILATED BY REBELS
LOS ANGELES, May 27.â Details
have been received in this city of the
death of George Ryan, a boy advent
urer and soldier of fortune, who was
shot by insurgents in the Philippines
while digging up money buried near
Manila by a Chinese. The body of
Ryan was lashed to a raft hv the na
tives and was seen floating down a
river and recovered by the American
trocps. It was identified by Dr. Samuel
Karr, who went to Manila from Hono
lulu on the vessel that carried Ryan.
At the time the advices received in this
city were written all that was mortal
of the young adventurer lay on a slab
in the Manila Morgue; mute evidence
of the ferocity and barbarism of the
insurgents. Both of the arms had been
cut off and the body was otherwise
mutilated.
Ryan was 25 years of age and a Ken
tuekian by birth. When a mere boy he
had drifted to San Francisco, where he
became a newsboy and blacked shoes
at "Champion" Lyons' stand on Market
street. As a youngster it was his boast

that he shined the shoes of King Kala
kaua and received $5 for the job.
About thirteen years ago young Ryan
stowed himself away on an Australian |
liner and made his way to Honolulu.
He began selling papers in the Ha
waiian capital and soon became a
favorite. The revenue he derived from
a bootblack stand he set up soon yield
ed him sufficient to enable him to em
bark in more genteel pursuits.
When Queen Liliuokalani disagreed
with her Cabinet in January, 1593, and
the white residents of the islands
formed a provincial army, he was one
of the first to enlist. When the gov- j
ernment of Liliuokalani was over
thrown he obtained Kalakaua's crown
and relieved it of its numerous pre
cious stones. For this he was arrested,
tried and .sentenced to several years'
imprisonment. He served his time and
kept the hiding place of the gems se
cret. When he was released he estab
lished himself in business in Honolulu.
He had not lost prestige because of the
theft of the jewels, for, strange to say,
the swords and plate of the Hawaiian
dynasty has disappeared at the time
he took the crown.
When the Spanish-American war
broke out Ryan wished to enlist in the
American army, but could not get a
chance to come to the United States.
Then the Government commenced
sending troops to Manila and he went
in one of the first vessels as a stow
away. He went to work for a friend at I
Cavite and when the trouble with th<- â 
insurgents broke out he donned a uni
form. He took part in several engage
ments, but his passion for covertly ob
taining wealth led him beyond the
lines, whither he went with the inten
tion of obtaining treasure buried by a
Chinese who had fled into the city at
the outbreak of hostilities. Ho was sur
rounded by insurgents while digging
for the treasure and his death and the
mutilation of his body followed.
PROTESTS AGAINST
DESECRATION OF TOMB
So John Morley Will Oppose the
Proposed Big Grant to Lord

NKW YORK. May 27.â A cable to the
World from Lond\>n says: As the protest
against the desecration of the Mahdi's
tomb, John Morley will oppose the grant
of $150,000 to Lord Kitchener when it is
proposed In Parliament next week. Mr.
Morley says:
"The Mabdi was an Arab who eighteen
or twenty years ago headed the rising
against the tyranny and corruption of the
Egyptian Government of those days. He
was the man who slew our General Gor
don.
"Well now after the victory in Septem
ber last the men, acting under British
command, dug up the moldoring corpse
of this dead enemy of ours; they hacked
or tore off his head, they threw the rest
of the grewsome remains into the Nile,
and according to an artilleryman who
has told this story, they carried the bead
into a gunboat and put it into an empty
kerosene can. It remained there some
days. Then the British officers came and
said, 'I,et us see the head,' and. said the
artilleryman. 'We took a part of . his
beard, indeed I have got a bit of it my
self.' We now understand that the Mah
dl's head is buried at Wady Haifa. Ihia
is the story.
"We shall hear next week whether it is
quite true or that the head of this trophy
of our dead enemy was put into a wooden
box and sent to England and then fetched
back. I have said in the House of Com
mons that this desecration of the grave
of an enemy and this treatment of the
trophy is revolting in itself and reflects
no honor upon either the good sense or
right feelings of those who ordered it,
and it reflects disgrace upon the British

NOT READY "
TO ENLARGE
THE ARMY
But the President May Find
It Necessary to Secure
Additional Troops.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, WEL
INGTON HOTEL, WASHING
TON, May 27.â Dispatches from
Manila stating that more troops
are needed and that the Ameri
can army is suffering embarrassment
and unnecessary losses on account of
the lack of a sufficient force to occupy
territory from which the insurgents are
driven attract much attention here. It
is assumed that the facts are as stated
and that General Otis has his own rea
sons for -wanting them to become
known to the people of this country.
The President's reluctance to enlarge
the army to the full extent authorized
by Congress rentiers it difficult to sup
ply enough trained soldiers for the
Philippine campaign, and it is evident
that our army has been deprived of re
sults that should have followed from
its magnificent operations by being un
able to spare troops to hold positions
gallantly captured. It is believed that
General Otis wants either the retention
of tlfe volunteers he has or an enlist
ment of the full force authorized by
< Congress.
The President, in conversation with
some of his callers to-day, is quoted as
having said that he had hoped the vol
unteers would have an opportunity to
enjoy the full fruits of their magnifi
cent services by participating in the ac
tual pacification of the islands and
coming home as victors. It was mani
fested, however, that they could not
wait to see the matter through, and he
has hastened to have them replaced
with regulars and sent home as speedily
as possible. He said he did not think
there was any serious conflict between
General Otis and the civilian members
of the Peace Commission, and that if
there were he would feel the necessity
of the army being free from interfer
ence. The President is quoted further
as saying that it has become manifest
that the Philippine campaign Bhould
be made as aggressive as possible and
should be carried to a conclusion with
vigor, as advised by Admiral Dewey.
There was a rumor of a possible call
for 35,000 additional troops, but it was
said that the President was not now
giving any serious consideration to that
subject. If it is decided later to send
more troops to the Philippines a call
will be made in time to have the troops
reach the island just before the ending
of the rainy season, so that a swift
campaign can be inaugurated.
The withdrawal of volunteers from
the Philippines and the unsettled state
of affairs throughout the islands ne
cessitates the exercise of the utmost
expedition by the War Department in
the dispatch of reinforcements to Otis'
small but gallant army. The plans of
the department contemplate the send
ing to the Philippines of all available
regular troops not required in the
United States. Cuba, Porto Rico or
Hawaii. The Grant is booked to sail
from San Francisco in a day or two
with the Sixteenth Infantry.
It was originally intended to send the
Nineteenth Infantry to the Philippines
on the Sheridan, which vessel has just
returned to San Francisco, but this plan
has been abandoned owing to the un
expected delay in bringing the regiment
back from Porto Rico. The Nineteenth
Infantry was on the transport Meade
when that vessel ran aground on a reef
just outside of Ponce about two weeks
ago, and it is still detained in that
country awaiting the repair of the
troop ship.
Owing to the exigencies of the service
it has been found inexpedient to hold
the Sheridan at San Francisco for the
Nineteenth Infantry, and that vessel
will start for Manila on the 7th prox.
with about 2000 recruits for various
regiments in the Philippines. These re
cruits are already at San Francisco,
and were eventually scheduled, for duty2
in ill. Philippine s. Thei efore the pres
llte their move
â  ral weeks.
Several transports are now on their
v.;i> to San Francisco from Manila, and
the earliest of them will be used for
1.1 transportation of additional

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 28. 1899.
Inc. On the morning of thelflth of March,
ivy Deputj Collector Aguirre said to the
same official that unless the examination
papers came from Washington by that
rt-'jni'ng's man there w.ui'i be no
examination on that day. as the papers
had not arrived from Washington, v is
also in evidence that Collector Cbenoweth
on the morning of t Â» 1 . - 16th "f March, 18X,
took the envelope containing the examin
ation i apers back to the postofilce before
the arrival of the morning mail and put
i!:-'P> !*rÂ«. the Custom unuw pÂ«#Â«.lj|nÂ».e
box. and then, after 1 1 j â¢ â¢ arrival of the
mall went to 1 1 1 â¢ â¢ Custom-house and re
turned the key which he bad borrowed,
and said that he could n>>t open the i">x
and fur the official to go and see ir ho
could get the mail.
The official went to the postofflce and
opened the box wlthoul any difficulty
whatever, and there among the mail mat
ter was the envelope -containing the ex
amination papers, which had arrived once
before, on the 14th day of March, IS9B.
The three Beals on the envelope had been
carefully cul with some sharp Instru
ment, then reheated and stuck together
again, bui in such a manner as to muti
late the Impression on the seals and oth
erwise t â¢ â¢ give away the crime. Also, th>'
Kogales postmark, dating the arrival of
the package, March n. had been tam
pered with, the original date rubbed out
in pan and the figure "'â¢" marked in with
a lead-pencil, making the date read
"March U." This envelope has been care
fully preserved, and is now In the office of
th. Civil Service Commission at Wash
ington, D. C. it is further In evidence
that Mrs. Chenoweth and Mrs. Aguirre
while in the examination room did not
appear to be working the problems, but
seemed to be copying from other papers,
and went through the ordeal much
. â¢â !â  than the soldier from Huachuca
and Mr. Hitchcock, who participated In
. mination.
Mr. Chenoweth was in the room where
the examination was being held during
the whole of the time that Mrs. Cheno
wetlwand Mrs. Aguirre were being exam
ined, and when the three retired a new
guard was put on to remain until the
other applicants had finished working
their problems, etc.
It i- also In evidence thai Collector
weth, alter the facts of this gigan
tic fraud became known, prepared a paper
for th. signatures of the customs officials,
stating thai there was no fraud practiced
or attempted to be practiced In the ex
ition. Seme of the officials who are
charged with being parties to the fraud
â  â ! the paper, but others refused to
do so. , yen when an attempt was made
to intimidate them, which threats were
backed up by the presence of a profes
sional gunflghter, whom Chenoweth took
along with him when be demanded that
the paper be signed.
It can Ik stated as a fact of public his
tory that about the middle of the past
summer Mrs. Chenoweth was sworn in as
cashier of the Custom-house, and is now
mi the pay roll as such, and. at th< same
time it is announced by Custom-hoilse
brokers who pay large amounts of money
Into the Custom-house that Mrs. Cheno
weth has never acted as cashier and has
never received or receipted for any sum
or sums whatever. Mrs. Aguirre was as
signed t>> some position in the Custom
house and went "ti the pay roll at a later
date.
.Mr. k:^e.j :; s catted OH Mr. McKey and
Mrs. Chenoweth to stand a re-examina
tion, but they refused to participate there
ln. He iiis" asked Mr. Chenoweth to send
for J. J. Chatham In order t" give him
a re-examlnation, but Mr. Chenoweth re
fused to send for Chatham.
It is well known here that other flag
rant charges have been made against
these same official* and reported Investi
gations made. This rnav be so, but it is
believed ber< that if the investigations
have been made the merits of the rase
have never reached the department at
Washington.
This community is satisfied that the
ent Investigation Instigated by Mr.
Klgglns of the Civil Service Commission
will be honestly, fairly and faithfully
done.
Mr. Chenoweth offered to hot not long
Blnce the sum, of $500 that nothing would
come of the investigation, alleging that a
pull at Washington would fix the matter
up and nothing would come of It.

PARIS, May 27.â As the moment for
the opening sitting of the Court of Cas
sation over the Dreyfus case draws
near a feeling of nervous tension seems
to be oppressing everybody. I have It
on good, perhaps the best, authority,
if hi except M. Ballot de Beaupre him
self, that the official reporter's sum
ming up of the case will urge the ab
solute inevitableness of revision.
Tho d( mand for places in court on
Monday is enormous. M. Bergougnan,
president of the judicial press. h;Â«s been
bo harassed by the complaints of jour
nalists about their places that he re
signed his functions last night. All his
work devolves on the vice president,
who refuses to be troubled, leaving the
journalists to fight it out
The Herald has made arrangements
with M. Marcel Prevost, the novelist,
for Bpecial pen-pictures of the sittings
of the court. These will be given sup
ntary to the regular stenographic
r< ports of the proceedings. M. Prevost
has a peculiar faculty for literary pho
tographs of judicial dramas.
Early this afternoon it was rumored
that the president of the civil section of
the Court of Cassation, M. Ballot de
Beaupre, had reported to the Presi
dent of the Court of Cassation, M. Ma
zeau, in favor of a revision of the Drey
fus trial and Bending the prisoner again
before a court-martial. This, later in
the day, was confirmed by a direct
Statement that the president of the
civil section had so reported to the
presideni of the Court of Cassation.
It is believed that it Is practically
C( Main to' be accepted by the Court of
Cassation, and means that Dreyfus
will be brought back to France and re
tried.
The proceedings in the rase will con
sist of the reading of the report of M.
l'.:iil<-t de Beaupre. followed by a
li by Maitre Mornard. counsel for
Mme. Dreyfus, and the address of the
Public Prosecutor, M. Maneau. The
court will then retire to deliberate upon
a verdict, which it is expected will be
rendered on Friday or Saturday.
BIG DEMONSTRATION
TO HONOR MARCHAND
LONDON*. May 27.â A great demon
stration is being prepared in honor of
Major Marchand on his arrival in Paris
on Monday next. The Military Club,
where the African explorer â¢will stay,
is to be ambitiously decorated. General
Zuiiinden, the Military Governor of
Paris, has arranged for delegations of
all arms of the army and navy to re
ceive the major at the club. Everybody
present will be in uniform, so the event
will be one of the most brilliant recep
tions ever se*-n in Paris. The police
have prepared to rope with attempts
to arouse a repetition of the
craze. All seditious emblems will be
seized. Major Marchand, however, is
not desirous of playing the role of a
second Boulanger. His father has re
ceived a letter from his saying:
"The news that some sort of a
grandiose reception is in store fills me
with disappointment, not unmingU>d
with disdain. My sword belongs only
to my country, and I will never dis
honor it by playing the game of a
few facetious Individuals."
It is certain there will be stirring

RAISIN-GROWERS HAVE
WON THEIR FIGHT
NEW YORK, May 27.â Theo H. Kear
ney, president of the California Raisin
Growers' Association, in the course of a
conversation shortly before leaving to
day for a brief trip abroad, taken chiefly
to try the waters at Homburg, said:
"In our efforts to organize last year we
met a certain amount of hostility on the
part of the trade of the East. We were
sorry to encounter it. The management
is extremely anxious to so conduct busi
ness as to win the good will of the trade
in the- East, and we think that if the
trade had really understood what we
were doing we would not have met this
opposition at all.
"One of the greatest sources of diffi
culty to the success of the raisin indus
try was the inferior and sometimes dis
honest packing and the disposition among
brokers and dealers in the East to cut
commissions and prices. Of course we had
in take radical measures to control these
matters, and we insisted upon having
such contracts with brokers as practi
cally deprived them of being free agents
In their own business. This disturbed
connections in the East and West and
created some hostility. We were not
forced to take any hostile action against
the brokers, however, as they agreed to
what we asked and we have left the trade
practically in the same channels it has
always been In. It makes it much bet
ter for trade because trade is assured of
standard quality and gets, as raisins are
sold for twice for what they sold before,
double its commissions on the same
amount of trade."
Lumber Prices Again Advance.
At a special meeting: of the- Pine Manu

rough merchantable lumber of $1 per
thousand and $2 per thousand on uppers.
Nos. 1 and 2 flooring, etc., were announced
to take effect at 12 m. to-day. The in
crease in freights is said to be the prin
cipal cause of the rise In prices.

A FLYING FISH
Large Tuna Wrecks Their Boat,

LOS ANGELES, May 27.â One of the I
most remarkable experiences ever re

Avaldnj Catallna Island, yesterday, al
most resulting in the drowning of three
men, and well illustrating the power
Of game fish of Southern California.
Tin- tournament of the Tuna Club has i
created great Interest, and ten or
twelve members of the Hub have been
trying for the first tuna of the season
night and day. Yesterday C. F. Holder,
president of the Tuna Club, and T. M.
Townsend of Philadelphia, with "Jim" j
Gardner as boatman, started for Long i
Point, towed by the launch Minnehaha.
in charge of Bassett of Pasadena. Off
Whites Landing, four miles from Ava- j
lon, they struck a large school of tunas, j
the Hying flsh darting in every direc
tion.
Townsend had the first strike, but ;
failed to hook. A second later Holder
had a strike. In a moment the boat
was rushing astern after the fish. The
rod was the lightest ever used for tuna:
the line was the Tuna Club regulation
twenty-one strand. After a hard strug
gle the- fish was brought to gaff in i
about forty minutes. Holder passed
the tip of his rod forward; Gardner;
hooked the fish with the caff and pro
ceeded to haul it in.
Just as it was landed the fish gave a
convulsive leap and capsized the boat,
which began to sink. The fishermen j
were about a mile from shore. The;
launch was some distance away, hav
ing kept off to avoid the line when the
fiflh was playing.

The Pope Intends to Promote a Pre
late After the Coming Council
of Bishops.
NEW YORK, May C7.â On its own ac
count and for the direct bearing Its re
sults will have on the problem of the
Catholic church in our new possessions
prelates hero are intently watching the
outcome of the plenary council of Bish
ops of the Latin republics which opens to
morrow in Rome, tt was summoned to
mi â¢ i by a rescript from the Pope, issued
lasi Christmas and addressed to the Bish
ops of South America and Mexico. Ses
sions will be held at the South American
College in Rome and will be presided over
l.\ a Cardinal specially designated by the
Pope. Ten Archbishops and fifty-nine
Bishops are expected to participate In the
proceedings. No stated programme has
bei i! lai<i down for the business of the
council other than the general welfare of
the church in these countries. It is un
derstood, however, that one of the chief
topics will be the difficulties that are con
tinually cropping up in all these repub
lics between Masonic bodies and the
church authorities.
Modifications of existing laws in their
relation to non-Catholic marriages and
burials and their general toleration are
also likely to come up. The whole bear
ing of the teaching of Spanish-American
clergy in contradistinction to the policy
of the- church In the United States will be
a factor in the discussions. This will be
all the more important and prominent
because of the new relationships that the
church must take on in our new posses
sions. It is anticipated that at the end
of the council, which may last for a week
or more, the Pope will announce that he
intends to create one of the attending
prelates a Cardinal at the coming con
sistory. South America has never had a
Cardinal. It Is believed the honor will be
given to Brazil.

Annual Picnic at Biggs.
BIGGS, May 27.â The citizens and
friends held their annual reunion in Biggs
yesterday. From an early hour a steady
string of vehicles bearing" merry picnick
ers arrived in town. The visitors were
from Butte. Glenn and Colusa counties
and the cities of Marysville, Wheatland
Chico. Oroville, Colusa and Gridley. The
features of the forenoon were a speech by
Colonel 11. T. Bartchclder of Oroville, and
the address of welcome by Professor
George H. Stout of Biggs. There were
games, races, a tug of war and other
j sports for prizes. In the afternoon there
i was dancing at the cannery. The base
ball game between the Gridley and Wil
lows teams was won. by the latter. The
day's festivities closed with a ball in
Hamilton Hall.
Holder's end of the boat sank and !
left htm in the water. Seeing that it j
would not hold them all he struck out j
for the launch, which he finally j
reached, greatly exhausted.
Even then the boat would not hold !
the two men and the fish and rolled j
over and over several times, the lone j
wire leader of Holder's line having
wound around Townsend's legs. "Jim" |
Gardner started for the launch, leav
ing Townsend alone in the boat, which
now turned bottom up, allowing
Townsend to climb on the keel and
float.
All this time Gardner held on to
Holder's fish, and he performed a most
remarkable feat of courage and pluck.
He swam from the sunken boat, still
holding the fighting fish. Sometimes he j
was on the fish, sometimes the fish was ;
on him. Three times the game creature
made desperate plunges and carried
him under water. Finally Gardner |
reached the launch exhausted. He j
never released his grasp on the fish i
until Holder, Bassett and Mrs. Gardner i
drey/ it in. Then Gardner was pulled j
over the side, and Townsend, who had
insisted upon the fish being landed be- I
fore he was rescued, was picked up. !
A rope was thrown to him, and as he
let go the boat he was towed to the
launch and hauled in, after a plucky
exhibition.
When the fishermen were rescued iho
water for an acre around looked as
though there had been a wreck. Oars, |
clothr-s, rudders, gaffs, hats and ntht-r
debris floated about.
When Gardner was hauled in Holder's j
hook was found in his clothes. It had
cut his arm. Gardner was badly cut
and scraped by the fish.
REINA MERCEDES CASTS
ANCHOR AT NORFOLK
Captured Spanish Cruiser Turned
Over to the United States
Government.
NORFOLK, Va., May 27.-Amid the
booming of cannon and the screaming of
steam whistles from tugs, bay steamers
and ocean liners the captured Spanish
cruiser Reina Mercedes arrived in port
this afternoon. Accompanying her was a
flotilla of six tugs.- all profusely deco
rated with flags. Cannon saluted as she
was towed through the harbor, and the
tugboats kept their whistles in an almost
continuous scream from the time she
rounded Lambert's Point until the navy
yard was reached. Every craft tied down
the whistle lever, and there was a babel
of notes. The Mercedes was saluted by
every passing steamer and acknowledged
each greeting by a blast of her whistle.
It took considerable time to make the
prize fast to the wharf. After she was
turned over to the United States Govern
ment Captain Seymour, local agent of the
Merritts, received a receipt for the vessel.
MRS. OELRICHS' SPITE
FENCE TORN DOWN
NEW YORK. May 27.â Mrs. Hermann
Oelrlch's alleged spite fence between her
place and that of George E. Parkman at
Newport was reduced to kindling-wood
by her order to-day. The matter has oc
casioned her no end of trouble and an
noyance, for it was not her purpose or
desire to embarrass Mr. Parkman be
cause he would not sell her his estate,
as it was said she had done.
Mrs. Oelrichs and her architect visited
the place this morning and found the :
fence nothing like what she wanted,
and so she ordered its removal. She did
not intend to have it on a line between i
the two estates. A seven-foot fence
will now be erected all around Mrs. Oel
rich"s new house.
YALE OARSMEN WIN.
ANNAPOLIS. Bid., May 27.â The crew j
of Yale University's eight-oared shell !
outrowed the naval cadets to-day over j
a two-mile straighaway course and
crossed the line eleven and a half seconds j
ahead of the middies. The contest was
over the inside course on the Severn, j
Both crews took the water well at the i
sound of the pistol and got away to- I
gether. The superior weight and better j
training of the New Haven boys soon
demonstrated their superiority, and the '
visitors Bteadlly increased their lead to j
the finish. Once or twice Superintendent
Gannon of Annapolis tried to urge his
men. but the Connecticut boys as often
nobly responded to their captain's com
mand, and the advantage gained at the
start was gradually increased. Yale
crossed the line in 10 minutes and 28 sec
onds, with the cadets eleven and a half |
seconds and several lengths astern.
BIG STRIKE OF OIL.
LOS ANGELES, May 27.â A 400-barrel I
oil spouter is the latest thing at Fuller
ton. The well was uncovered yesterday
morning. It belongs to the Gruham-
Loftus Oil Company. Oil was struck at a I
depth of 1460 feet and the well is deeper
than any ever put down in the field. The i
Santa Fe people have a well 1200 feet deep
about 100 foet from the new gusher.
The discovery of the new Graham-Lof- ;
tvs increases the daily production of the j
field to 700 barrels. The field is now .is i
large an actual producer as any other sec
tion in the State. The oil ranges in gray- '
ity between 20 and 22 degrees, although !
oil of 32 degrees gravity has heen found i
in three of the most easterly of the wells I
worked. The oil is now worth here be- 1
tween 80 cents and $1 a barrel.

mont from the university was the re
sult of internal dissen.sir.ua in the hier
archy and of disagreements among
members of the faculty of the institu
tion, some of whom clung to the old
world notions of church polity, while
others, with them Kishop Keane at
their head, advocated more liberal
ideas.
Archbishop SatolH was then in the
ascendancy, and it is believed that his
reports led the "Pope to depose
Bishop Keane. Satolli left the coun
try, to ho succeeded by Mgr. Marti
nf-lli, and while the former was still on
the ocean on his way to the eternal
city Bishop Keane was removed and
summoned to appear before the eccle
siastical authorities. It was feared
that the summons boded no good to the
retiring rector, but the contrary proved
to be the fact, for not long after his ar
rival in Rome Leo XIII began to be
stow favors upon the American Bishop.
He was soon promoted to Archbishop.
With th^ promulgation of the Pope's
recent letter on "Americanism," all
the difficulties in the church on thi3
side of the Atlantic having been adjust
ed. Archbishop Keane"s presence in
Rome became no longer necessary, and
h:s application for a leave of absence
for two years was readily granted.

TRANSPORT SOLACE
HERE FROM MANILA
Brigadier General King Not a Passen-
ger on the Vessel as
Reported.
VALT.KJO, May 27.â The naval trans
port Solace arrived at Mare Island this
afternoon at 6 o'clock, having sailed from
Manila on April 11. She came via Yo
kohama and Honolulu and took twenty
six days' actual running time, though
Captain A. C. Dunlap. her commander,
says the time would have been less had
she been crowded. The run from Hon
olulu was made In eight days. She brings
as passengers Lieutenants Henry Mime.tt
and M. C. Gorgas, Passed Assistant En
gineer Emory Winship and Assistant Pay
master Lewis ' Poessel of the navy and
First Lieutenant B. C. Gilbert of the Sixth
United States Artillery. The Solace
stopped off the Mare Island lighthouse
to land Lieutenant Gorgas, whose family
resides there. Paymaster Poessel is the
last volunteer pay officer remaining In the
service. â¢
The Solace carries a complement of
twelve officers and seventy-four men.
Among the officers is Ensign W. T. Clu
verius, a son-in-law of Admiral Sampson.
The vessel has on board a draft of 173
men to be discharged, 9 prisoners for the
naval prison at the barracks and 22 sick
men. She has a guard of twenty-nine
marines. .
The advices from Honolulu that Briga
dier General Charles King. U. S. A., was
a passenger on the Solace had no foun
dation. Captain Dunlap states that per
mission for the general to come on his
vessel would have had to .be obtained
from Admiral Dewvy and that no request
for the purpose was made. He is at a
loss to know how the rumor started.
The Solace is as clean as can Be im
agined and is in' need of very few re
pairs. The authorities at Mare Islan^
have been expecting her and will do what
repairing Is necessary in a very short
time.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW V<Â»KK. May L'T.â Twenty-live
thousand delirious men and women
saw the good <"lt Haiiastai", owned by
; 'William H. Clark, romp away with the
purse attached to the Brooklyn handi
-1 cap at Gravesend this afternoon. Never
. in the history of the classic turf event
, did a horse win a fairer or finer race,
nor more clearly demonstrate its bu-
I periority over all competitors.
After thÂ»> horses had been twenty
three minutes at the post the red (lag
was dropped with a "Go:" It was a
good start for all but Box, Jefferson
and Don de Oro, they being rather
slow to get goinp, "vvith the latter ap
pearing t>> prop himself. Filigrane was
off with a rare dash, attended by the
black mare Imp and Lanky B.>b. The
| favorite set a heartbreaking pace as
j coon as he was settled in his stride and
j George Keen*' stuck to him like an ad
der. Little McCue bent over Filigrane's
neck, trying to get away from the
i Paget horse, as if it were the last in- â 
j stead of the first furlong of the groat
I struggle, but George Keene had as
much speed as the three-year-old.
When they Hashed past the eighth
: pole in 12 3-5 seconds Filigrane's head
i was in front, with Banastar, Algol,
! Imp and Previous almost locked less
l than a length away from Keene; then
Thomas Cat and Don de Oro, which
had made a whirlwind rush after
j Spencer had got him in motion. Lanky
I Bob was next, with Everett hard at
: him to keep up with the first flight.
The second eighth witnessed a
change. Clawson and George Keene
had wrested thÂ« lead from McCue and
Filigrane and all four were doing their
best to break the hearts of those be
hind them. But Banastar was with
them and Maher appeared to be in no
hurry to try and run them down. The
pace had been growing hotter and hot
ter, for George Keene Hew past the
quarter-pole in 24 4-5 seconds, making
! the second eighth in 12 1-5, or 2-5 faster
than the first. Filigrane was at his
head and Banas'ar a half length away,
with Algol, Imp and Previous at the
Clark horse's neck; then Thomas Cat,
Don de Oro, Lanky Bob and Warren
ton, all close enough to have a grand
chance. All this time Ben Holiaday
was laboring with Jefferson in the rear.
George Keene and Filigrane, heads
apart, continued to hold their places as
pace makers in the third furlong, and
Banastar was still their most danger
ous competitor, though they had in
creased their Lead over the sou of Par
ondale to a length and a half. Maher
sat sphinx-like on his handsome Bteed,
apparently satisfied with his position.
There were no changes in the positions
j of the others, except that imp began
to lose ground ;.s the leaders swung
around the three-eighths pole in 37 sec
onds Hat -the third furlong having been
run in exactly the same time as the
second.
It was evident that both Clawson and
McCue had no waiting orders, for their
mounts were steaming to the utmost.
I and it was only a question of which
would stop first. No horse could Hvo
through that terrific pace. Nobody save
Banastar behind them appeared to
threaten, but there were still many
game and tried ones in the chase, and
the backers of Bangle. Algol and Don
!de Oro were beginning to shout the
I names of their favorite. Spencer was
using his daintiest art on the Don. and
though he was running eighth and about
that many lengths behind the leaders
his supporters were not without hope.
The half mile in 49 1-5 seconds, a; I
still three-quarters to. go! Faster than
the speediest sprinters run. in three 7
i quarter dashes they went. The fourth
furlong was covered in VI 2-5 seconds.
George Keene and Filigrane were still
head and head, and Banastar was hold
| ing his own, with Algol straining . very
n< rye to keep at his neck. And ther-i
were others behind still hopeful of im-
I roving their positions.
"The next, eighth must see a change,"
said an old. gray-haired turfite behind
me. "No three-year-old can stand that
strain."
The fifth furlong did witness a change,
but it was Gec.-rge Keene who began to
show the effect of his magnificent ef
fort. Clawson was at him and the
Paget horse was feeling the sting of.
steel In his heaving gides. Flligrane,
the game three-year-old, was nol i"
be denied, and the five-furlong pole
showed his head in front of his rapidly
tiring competitor. The five furlongs
â  run in 1:02, the fifth eighth havin \
been run in :Yi 4-T>. Banastar had ini
proved his position. He had never been
bothered or hampered, running third,
only a length behind the leaders. The
great crowd yelled for him to :-i<> <>n.
Algol, too, had friends, and Don de Oro
and Lankj Bob mad' determined ef
forts to get away from the rear divis
ion.
I'll the backstretch, nearing the Car
turn, Filigrane and George Keene wen
being ridden desperately. When the
three-quarter pole was reached Pili
grano's head showed first and the
watches indicated 1:14 2-5. The sixth
furlong was faster than the fifth, hav
ing been run in :12 2-5.
Filigrane was doing marvelous work,
but th<- four-year-old from the ('lark
stable had all the best of the weights
and appeared to have a lot in hand.
Scarcely had they made the turn when
Banastar caught the colt and George
Keene and swept past them as it' they
were tied. One, twn, three, four, flvt
lengths' advantage Maher gave his
mount before McCue and Clawson real
ize, i how fast Banastar was going away
In in ih.-m. McCue stuck his heels into
the three-year-old and Filigrane an-
Bwered gamely, but George Keene had
shot his bolt and was rapidly losing
ground.
As Tar as Banastar was concerned the
race was over, for, full of run, he fairly
flew for the mile post in 1:39 2-5, having
run the eighth furlong: in 12 2-f, Becohda
and Hi' 1 quartet in ~'< s wds.
When George Keene cracked, Everett
en Lanky Bob and Spencer on Don do
Oro begun their final efforts and both
horses answered with a will. Straight
ened for home, the run in was only a
<iu>sti"!i of place honors, Banastar
having tlv field soundly beaten. Maher
kepi the ''lark horse going, however,
and the mi 1< â  and a furlong was mail
in 1:52 3-5, the furlong having been run
in 13 seconds.
Behind Banastar the sight was a
thrilling one. Everett drove his spurs
into Lanky Bob's steaming sides and
the son of Lord Hartington answered
gamely. He caught and passed the now
thoroughly tired Filigrane, but could
make no headway on the leader, whom
Maher was simply guiding home.
Don de Oro, too, was struggliiig no
bly. Spencer did not raise his whip nor
us-' his spurs. The Don was doing all
he could, but the distance was too great
to be overcome.
Banastar was taken in hand the last
sixteenth, and Maher brought him
home alone three lengths to the good,
amid piercing shrieks and shrill cries.
Lanky Bob was second, a full length
before the game but tired Filigrane,
and I >< -Ti <).â¢ Oro was fourth, two
lengths away and only a head in front
of Bangle. Then came Algol and Ken
Holladay. the latter never a factor
from the fall of the flag.
The California mare Maxine (for
merly Fleur de Lis), with Doggett up,
was fourth at the start, quickly drop
ping back, and finished twelfth. She
was never prominent in the race. In
the betting Maxine was 40 to 1 straight
and 10 ti; 1 for the place.
The time of the winner, 2:06*4, Is a
new record for the race, the 2:07 of
Dry Monopole having been made in the
first running of the handicap in 18S7.
The time, 2:06*4. might have been a
good bit faster had Maher desired to
make it so. The record of 2:07 has
stood since 1887, when Dry Monopole,
Blue Wing and Hidalgo ran nose and
nose to the most exciting finish ever
witnessed.
The Brooklyn handicap is a stake of
$10,000. of which $8000 poos to the win

AS RICH AS THE
KLDHDSKE FIELD
Cape Nome Creeks Yield
Big Returns.
Special Dispatch to Thn Call.
VICTORIA, ii. C, May 27.âAccord
inging to news received by the steamer
City of Toneka this morning Messrs.
Sloss and Wilson of the Alaska Com
mercial Company, who are en route to
Dawson, received letters while at Skag
uay from representatives of the com
pany both at Dawson City and St.
Michael confirming the news of the
big strikes reported, from the vicinity
of Cape Nome. The St. Michael agent
of the company says the first news of
the strike Mas brought to St. Michael
in December.
' I. ate in that month," says the agent
in his letter to Sloss, "three tawny
looking prospectors came to the settle
ment suddenly and unheralded from
Snake River, the leading waterway of
the new gold fields, which enter
Bering- Sea near < 'ape Nome. They
looked like deadbeats, and when they
ordered big outfits and no small
amount of provisions 1 got leery and
wanted to see the color of their money.
They produced without delay, dropping
a bag of dust on the table which must
have contained some $1200. This, the
trio of miners said, was the product of
a month's work and they wanted their
outfits in a hurry to get back to the
district. Day after day miners con
tinued to reach the settlement with
wonderful tales of lucky finds along
Snake River and its feeders and all had
thf>fst)Ul to back up their stories.
"Itwas not long before the whole
settlement stampeded and I went, too,
together with the North American
Trading and Transportation Company's
men. We got in early and staked some
good properties."
The letters received from Dawson say
that according to advices received by
the agent of the company there the
whole district in the vicinity of Snake
River is richly studded with gold. Cold
is being found on every creek, and even
along the seashore miners are rocking
out dust and nuggets. Great excite
ment prevails all along the lower Yu
kon and crowds are hurrying to the
new-found placers. Preparations are
bring made by the fortunate elaim
owners for development. Rows of sluice
boxes are to be seen and numbers of
men are hauling in provisions.
Quite a town has grown already at
the mouth of Snake River. It is being
laid out in lots and many buildings are
under way.
The stampede has already hampered
the captains of the river steamers. The
crews deserted and joined the stam
pede and the companies cannot get men
at any price.
Prospectors at work in the hills to
the north of Boulder Creek, which runs
into Snake River from the north, are
reported to be taking out from $15 to
$22 to the pan. The agent says Boulder
more than rivals the richest of the
Klondike creeks. The agent says that
a stampede has begun from Dawson
and the camps on the American side
and more will follow shortly. Num
bers are awaiting the opening of the
river to float down in small boats.
DISTRICT PAIR FOR STOCKTON.
Wearied of Waiting for Gage, the Cit-
izens Take Action.
STOCKTON, May 27.â Stockton will
have an old-time fair this year. It was
intended at first to wait until Governor
Gage appointed a now board of agricul
tural district directors and let them put
their shoulders to the wheel, but as the
time is short the business men decided to
take hold oh their own responsibility. An
organization has been effected to lease
the Fair Association property and give
a race meeting: and a pavilion exhibit.
The organization is officered as follows:
George E. Catts. president: W. C. Neu
miller, vice president; J. W. "Willey, sec
retary and treasurer. It will be known
as the Stockton Driving Club.
Business men will be waited upon at
once for pledges and contributions in or
der that the long neglected track may be
put into condition, and the pavilion re
paired. Contributions are coming in most
satisfactorily. It is the intention to of
fer $5000 in purses at the track, and to
bring the best horses on the coast here.
Arrangements will be made to secure the
old fair dates, which are the third week
in September.
Horsemen all over the country will re
member the famous kite-shaped track, on
which many turf records were won. This
track may be put into condition, but it
is more probable that the circular mile
track will be repaired, as it is not in
quite so dilapidated a condition as the
other.

SAVE! By THE
SUGAR BEET
Pine Lands of Michigan
Put to Use.
MANY ACRES ARE UTILIZED
BONANZA FOR SMALL FARMERS
ON "CUT-OVER" TRACTS.
Through Proper Encouragement by
the Legislature the State Prom
ises to Soon Lead in Pro
ducing Sugar.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LANSING. Mich.. May 27.â The Michi
gan Legislature has at last solved the
problem of how to utilize thousands of j
acres of cut-over pine lands, which con
stitute a large portion of the State. The
cut-over pine lands have long been an
eyesore to the people of Michigan. The
soil is sandy and poorly adapted to agri
culture. Farmers who settled in the cut
over country met with little encourage
ment from the sterile soil and thousands
of acres in the lower and upper peninsu
las are unbroken wastes of tangled un
derbrush and sapling cedars.
Eight years ago the State founded an I
experiment station at Gaylurd in the
low^r peninsula to ascertain what use |
could be made of the waste lands. Thou- j
sands of dollars were spent without re- I
suits, and the station was abandoned.
The solution was accidentally hit upon j
two years ago when the Legislature i
passed a bill allowing a bounty for the
production of beet sugar. Experiments
were made all over the State, and it was
found that in the sandy soil of the pine
belt sugar beets grew large and sweet.
The Legislature appropriated $40,000
bounty fnr the production of beet sugar,
and if more is needed it may be drawn
from other funds of the State. But one
factory whs started after the passage of
the law two years ago. It produced
5.500.000 pounds "i" sugar last year and re
celved $58,000 in bounties from the State. '
So profitable did the experiment prove
that eleven factories, none of which is to
cost less than $50,000, are in process of
construction, and farmers all through the
I pine belt are turning their attention to
!â ' .-i raising.
The State will spend at least $2,000,000 in
bounties in the next two years, and in
four years Michigan will be the greatest
sugar producing State in the Union.
Farmers of the upper peninsula have
experimented with beet raising, and sugar
I beets raised in Menominee County average
from 16 to 18 per cent saccharine. The
law allows 1 cent a pound bounty on all
i lei I sugar produced and provides that
factories pay farmers at least $4 a ton
for sugar beets averaging 14 per cent of
saccharine and 50 cents a ton for each
additional per cent of saccharine. This
' insures the farmer $1 a ton profit, with a
chance for more, and as the lands yield
sixteen tons to the acre the beet industry
will prove a bonanza to the farmer.
The State will get its money back in
time in taxes. The waste lands in Meno
minee Count y, which formerly sold for
taxes have been bought recently In blocks
of 2000 and 4000 acres, and the growth of
the industry will mean a great advance
in the value of Michigan farm lands. .

FEARFUL CYCLONE
SWEEPS NEBRASKA
Most Disastrous Storm
in Ten Years.
MUCH PROPERTY DESTROYED
PEOPLE SEEK SAFETY IN THEIR
One Farmer, With His Wife and Son,
Finds a Place of Refuge Under
a Furrow in a Plowed
Field.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, May 27.â The most dlsa*Â»
trous cyclone that has visited Nebraska
since the Bradshaw storm, ten years
years ago, circulated between Minden
and Kenesaw shortly after 8 o'clock
last night and destroyed everything in
its path. There was no loss of life, as
the people saw the danger in time ;^r.d
saved themselves by crawling into cy
clone cellars or by hugging the furrows
in the plowed ground.
The first damage done was at the
farm of John V. Tennant, one mile due
north of Minden. Mr. Tennant, wife
and son saw it coming and ran to the
plowed field, where they buried them
selves in a furrow, tvâ - had â  1 - ncr
dropped to the ground than the cyclone
struck their home. Their two-story
house was wrecked and the corn shed
and barn were crushed as if they had
been made of paper.
At the farm of Joseph Rayer, a mile
east, every building was demolished
and all the stock kill<Â£l. Rayer, his
wife and an infant child took refuge In
a cyclone cellar and escaped with a. few
bruises.
Half a mile from Hartwell the cy
clone struck Peter Billisbach's farm
and swept everything before it. The
family of four were all injured, but
none seriously.
Between Hartwell and Kenesaw John
Mosher'a barn and sheds were de
stroyed and stock '-Hied. The town of
Hartwell was also hit and several
buildings wrecked. Between Hartwell
and Kenesaw the country was inun
dated by a cloudburst, the water rising
five feet along the railroad grade. At
7 o'clock this morning hailstones were
found in the streets of Xenesaw that
measured over four inches in circum
ference.
The path of the cyclone was about
one hundred feet wide and twenty
miles long, but varied in places. Every
thing demolished by the storm is a

Los {Ingeles Undertakers K^ep
Bodies iQ Their Possession
for Years.
LOS ANGEItES, May 27.â An innocent-appearing item has revealed <
the fact thai L lertakers, in defiance of the law, have kept \
for an indefinite time. When Mrs. J. T. j
Phillips arrived in San Francisco from Honolulu on the last steamer she &
learned that her husband had died several months ago in Los Angeles <
and that his body was being kept until she. could be communicated with <
ling its linal disposition. _ _ S
ly of Phillips revealed an unsatisfactory condition ]
r>f affairs. The record? at the health office failed to disclose any entry
he death of Phillips, and as the body could not have been c
buried unless a tifical ere obtained it was evident it was still in <
undertaking firm, if the man had died in the i
city. S
Ail of th undertakers were communicated with, but none had j
the bod J in charge. Some of them had from one to three â¢
in their vaults, and had kept them for periods ranging from one \
to three months. The body Â«* Phillips was not among the number and ?
no trace of it could be found. â¢
In th.- course of the investigation some peculiar facts were brought %
out The undertakers them '<â¢â¢ r were reticent concerning the bodies in \
thÂ«ir â  tted corpses were kept indefinitely before they Â»
r by burial or by sending to friends.
It was said one firm had for years kept three bodies In its vaults. *
One was that of an infant, another that of a man and the third that of c
a woman. In the case of the woman her husband was a miner in a
: field. While ' not be heard from for months at a time he i
always paid for the keeping of the corpse. <
In the case of the infant, it was said the parents were prominent *
people who ha<'. .in: over the State a great deal and did not I
wish to bury the body until they finally decided at what place they would \
make their permanent home. i
Th<> bodies were transferred, along with the paraphernalia of the i

the authorities here became convinced
that an adjustment was hopeless. But
the feeling in London was more hope
ful, and when Sir Julian Pauncefote
reached London on his way to The
Hague, he held conferences with Lord
Salisbury which resulted in a del
proposal for settling the boundary issue
and removing it as an Obstacle of the
commission. The main point of this
proposal was that a separate tribunal
of arbitration should pass on the
boundary question. It was communi
cated to Embassador Choate and by
him to the State Department.
When the plan was received th>*
President was absent at Hot Springs.
Va., and it was felt desirable to await
his return before giving a final answer.
There was little or no doubt that tlv
answer would have beenfavorabie. Just
as the acceptance was about to be giv
en, the officials here were surprised to
have presented what they regard* i as
an extraordinary condition which Can
ada imposed in connection with the
submission of th* question of arbitra
tion. This condition was that Canada
shmld have Pyramid harbor and a
strip of territory on the Lynn Canal,
without reference* to the general con
clusions reached by the tribunal of ar
bitration. This port and strip of terri
tory on the coast would have carried
also the back country leading to the in
terior.
This condition, coming after the ar
bitration plan had been formally pro
posed and was about to be accepted,
caused not only surprise but some in
dignation among the officials here. It
was decided not to accept this condition
and a peremptory refusal was given to
the proposition. Thus the matter
stands. There is every reason \" be
lieve that there will be no yielding of
the officials here to Canada's condition.
If it is withdrawn the arbitration may
â  1 as a means of s<-tt'iin2
the boundary. The opinion in the high
â iuarters seems to he positive that
without some adjustment of the bound
ary matter the resumption of the work
of the joint commission on the many
other topics considered is entirely im
probable. *

VALLEJO GETS DECISION.
May Build a Wharf at the Foot of
Virginia Street.
YALLEJO. May 'Sl.â An important d^ci- \
sion was rendered to-day by Judge j
Uuckles in the case of the Vallejo Ferry
1 Company vs. The City of Vailejo. It was
a suit to enjoin the dty from building a
I wharf from >.'â . foot of Virginia street
: into the bay, on the ground that, if con
| Btructed, it would materially interfere
J with reasonable and proper use of the
â  franchise and ferry of the plaintiff.
Virginia and Georgia streets are parallel
streets in the city of Vallejo, they are
only one block apart and extend to deep
water in the navigable waters between
Mafe Island and Vallejo. The plaintiff
i owns the ferry franchise purchased from
j the city of vallejo, which includes the
ferry .stf-amer landing at the foot of
Georgia street and running to arid from
Mare Island. Virginia street is north of
Georgia street. The city of Vallejo pro
s to erect a wharf at the foot of Vir
ginia street. No work of any kind haa
I been done on the proposed wharf.
Judge Buckles decided that the city
could build the wharf, with a few slight
modifications of the plans. There la re
joicing among the workmen on Mare Isl
lund because of the decision. The case
i has been in the courts more than a ye&t
j It may be appealed by the ferry company.

ENGLAND'S COAL
SUPPLY SHORT
Fifty Years Will Ex-
haust It.
bpeclal Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, im, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, May 27.â 1f Great Britain
had not America to look to in the fu
ture, within even the next half cen
tury this country might be in a pretty
pickle. J. li. Langdon, president of the
Institute of Mining .Engineers, has
been reviving the old alarming story
that the country is being worked out of
minerals, l>ut his story is mure alarm
ing than any that has appeared yet,
for people living in the present day
may see the time when they will have
no coal to burn. England without coal
would certainly be in a sad strait, but
Mr. Langdon produces sure enough tes
timony that the annual output of coal
has increased during the last Quarter
century from 120,00u,000 to 200,0u0,uu0
tons.
The cry of those who do not know
what they are talking about is '"go
deeper" but when we have reached
what is known as millstone grit, the
bottom has been reached and many col
lieries are in that state now.
At the present time it costs this coun
try from 35 to 45 shillings to produce
good pigiron, while in the United States
it can be made for 35 shillings. Some
twenty-five years ago Britain supplied
50 per cent of the world's coal, but now
supplies only 30; whereas at the same
time- the United States has increased
its supply to the world from 15 to 30
per cent. One thing certain, in the ex
opinion of Mr. Langdon, is that
in fifty years England will be dependent
on the United States for coal, iron and
.. and when that comes abuut
England will need an alliance with
America for coaling her navy, unless
some violent change takes place in our
motive power.

LOS ANGELES, May 17.â Governor
Henry T. Gage will appoint a sue-

the Whittier School trustees. He also
will reappoint Dr. Walter Lindley a
member of the board, for fear that the
doctor's previous appointment by Gover-
Hudd may not have been legal, be
cause it was not confirmed by the Sen
ate.
The Governor went to Highlands Asy
lum to-day, where the board of directors
of that institution met this afternoon.
The- Governor was ace impani< d by Dr. F.
W. Hate::. General Superintendent of
Hospitals. There has been more or
speculation Bince yesterday as to
whether the State S^nHte could be con
: in extra session for the purpose of
ng upon the Governor's appoint
â¢-. The consensus of opinion among
lawyers is that the upper nou
meet unless the Governor should call a
session of the Legislature as a whole.
ild such a session be deemed â  â 
sary there would have to be a daily bal

would be again a candidate until dis

BERNHARDT WAS
HIS BENEFACTOR
Why Mendes Cham
pions the Actress.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett. ,
PARIS, May 27.â At the bottom of
their hearts probably neither M. Cat
ralle Mendes nor M. Georges Vanor
cares a rap whether the real Hamlet
was as slim as lime. Sarah Bernhardt
or as fat as Flagstaff. M. Mendes is
keenly susceptible where Mme. Bern
hardt is concerned. It is a rather re
markable thing in this egotistical age,
for his sensitiveness is due to grati
tude. He looks upon the actress as his
savior and as the woman who pre
vented him from living, and dying a
literary machine. I -once heard him
tell the story, and tears came into his
eyes as old memories were revived,
Pew people know that Mendez for over
five years wrote semi-scientific ' and
general literary articles daily for the
Petit Parisien. He had previously gone
through a period of intense poverty, bo
that even slavery seemed better than
starvation. But it was dreary work.
During his starvation days he had
written his superb play, "Meres En
nemie.s," and had sent it to every thea
ter iranager in Paris, always receiving
it back a little more tattered and dir
tier each time. .â -.â '-/
"I was rapidly becoming stupefied, "
said Mendes on the day he related the
story to me.
"1 went to my office in the morning,
wrote until noon, lunched and then be
gan again, spacing out the lines au
tomatically until evening. I had no
ambition, no dreams, no hope. Every
time any theater changed hands 1 got
my 'Meres Ennemies' and sent it in
anew to the director, not with the idea
that it would be accepted, but as a
mere matter of habit.
"One day Bernhardt took the Ambigu
Theater. I happened to be bored, just
at the moment, by a. sort of hanger
on, who, under the excuse of running
errands for me now and again got a
few francs a week out of me. More to
be rid if him than anything else I sent
him off to Sarah's with the eternal
'Meres Ennemies.' A few days later I
was stunned to receive a note from her,
telling me she was about to produce my
play."
Everybody familiar with the theatri
cal history of Paris knows how she
kept her promise, for M. Mendes' play
was a success never equaled until
"Cyrano." It consecrated him as a mas
ter, and the writer has never forgotten
that it was Sarah who brought his ser
vitude to an end. That is why he took
bo much to heart M. Vanox's remarks
that Sarah was but a slender repre
sentative of the fat, scant of breath
Hamlet.
Fortunately, the wound which M.
Mendes received in the duel provoked
by his rather outspoken disapproval of
ML. Vanox's comments is less serious
than thought at first, and probably
within a very short lime he will be at
work again upon a book reviewing the
poetry of the nineteenth century, which
he is commissioned to write by the Min
ister of Beaux Arts for the ex
position. M. Mendes' poetical equip
ment is prodigious. He knows how to
express his thoughts clearly, convinc
ing and eloquently. It is said, in fact,
that some opinions in this official report
are so clearly expressed that there is
likely to be a vast amount of 'heated
discussion when It is published. Prob
ably some more duels are jn the per
j spective. - â¢
KILLED IN SIGHT
OF HER HUSBAND
A Stockton Woman's
Awful Death.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. May 27.â Mrs. Laura Rey
nolds was mangled to death under the
wheels of. a freight train to-night in plain
view of her husband. The Reynoldses. a
popular young married couple, boarded
the 10 o'clock eastbound Main-street car j
for home. The tracks of the electric car |
line and those of the Southern Pacific
cross at Sacramento street. When the
car reached the crossing extra freight
1624 was making up, several cars being
to the south of the street, while on the
north the engine was backing several
cats down for the purpose of making a ,
coupling. Brakeman Brown says he
called to Conductor Morrell to wait, but j
the car was then almost between the '
sections of the train, and in desperation
Motorman Norris turned on the full cur- j
rent and shot the car ahead.
The Reynoldses were sitting on the plat- \
form seat facing the approaching cars.
Either fearing the car would not clear the j
track, or not wanting to take the -isk,
both jumped. Mr. Reynolds alighted clear
of the crossing, but his wife lost her bal- â¢
ance and rolled directly in front of the!
moving cars, now a few feet away. Be- j
fore the husband could act the wheels <
were crushing the life out of his wife, j
She gave one scream and the wheels were
upon her. i
The train was stopped and the mangled j
form extricated and carried to the depot
lawn. The unfortunate woman still !
breathed, but before the ambulance ar
rived death relieved her.
Nearly every bone in her body was
broken and the limbs horribly crushed,,
but the face was unscathed. The body j
was taken to the morgue, while the halt- I
crazed husband was cared for by his
friends.
The couple had been downtown doing i
their Saturday evening shopping, and ;
were within two blocks of home when
death came suddenly upon the young
Wife. William Reynolds, who is a son of ;
O H. Reynolds, the liveryman, is an em
ploye of \Volls-Fargo. Mrs. Reynolds was
Miis Laura Duffy, a young lady reared
in this city.
TWO FRENCH GIRLS
ENGAGE IN A DUEL
â  Cable to Thp Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, IS3S, by James Gor- I
don 1 lennett.
PARIS, May 27.â Dueling is from time ;
to time indulged in by women, but it is
then a formidable and somewhat barbar- !
ous affair instead of the courteous ex- !
change of bullms without result in disa
blement by a scratch of one of the com
batants, that ii is wh<>n all save that)
irascible genusâ pottsâ resort to it.
Two young women, Jeanne Leroy and
Juliette Volant, the first 16 and the other
ira oi age, have had several quar- :
rÂ»-ls lately and finally decided to Bettle
! who was in the right by appealing to ;i :
trial by combat. The meeting-place was
vacant plat of ground in Rue
d'Alesia, over In the Montsouria quartier,
rather conveniently near t<) the mad
house. All approaches to the ground
j were guarded by friends, obligingly zeal- :
OUS to prevent interruption.
The duelists took off their corsetsâ no
Belf-respecting woman would fight a duel
with her corsets onâ then, armed with
knives of the most business-like length.
they got down to work. Both appeared
i to have had a healthy contempt for sci
enc< . and the absorbing desire of each I
I one appears to have been to jab her
j knife deep into the other. Both succeed- '
, cd. which is a tribute to woman's capa
bility of shining in any branch of civil
ized "life.
The police, it is true, Interfered, but the
: two combatants looked like chessboards
with patches of sticking-plaster when the
doctor? at the Broussais Hospital had '
i finished with them.

-LORD ROSEBERT
TALKS OF WEALTH
Small Advantages of the
Millionaires.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, May 27.â Interesting speeches
â¢were delivered this wf-ek by Lord Rose
bery, John Morley and Sir Michael Tlicks-
Beach, Chancellor of the Exchequer. The
first named, after a whimsical suggestion
that the speakers of the two parties
should change about for a time, the Con
servatives addressing Liberals and the
Liberals addressing Conservatives, thus
enabling the public to hear both sides,
spoke on the "exaggerated advantage of
wealth." pointing out that even million
aires could not eat more than one dinner
a day, wear one suit of clothes or ride one
horse at the same time. He added that
the only superiority that they possessed
over the poor was being able to command
the best medical advice and change of
climate, pointing out. however, thai
pitals for the poor had lessened even this
supposition.
These utterances brought forth a crop
of sarcastic comments on the. line of pity
for the poor millionaires.
The Daily Mail say?: "The speech leaves
only one course open to a man holding
those convictionsâ to sell all he ha
give to the poor. But Lord Rosebery. we
are confident, will never adopt such a
harsh measure. He has too much feeling
for the poor."
The Saturday Review speaks straight
out, saying: "From Lord Rosebery'a upa
this kind of moralizing is downright, un
adulterated cant."
Mr. Morley, criticizing Lord Roppbery'a
position in the party, made a happy epi
gram, dubbing his Lordship a 'dark'horse
in a loose box,' which is regarded .
ing a peculiarly appropriate description
of Lord Rosebery's present position
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach says he finds
in office "weariness of political life." and
speaking at Bristol, he expressed prefer
ence for a "live opposition." making the
novel suggestion that it" the opp<
does not win the next general election
the Conservatives "ought to play their
second term."
George W. Smalley. New V,>rk corre
spondent of the London Times, is the
author of a letter this week upon the In
iquity of the New York Custom-house of
tieials. and the papers here comment hu
morously on the subject.
The Speaker says: "It seems that there
! is no remedy fur the distress of the trav
eler but a gratuity which. Collector Bid
well says, is not a bribe. If he can form
a trust with unlimited funds upon which
the custom officials can be Quartered aa
pensioners, as all possible and an im
possible veterans of the Civi! War are
; quartered on the national purse, then la
j dies may be treated by the officials "( ihe
; republic with almost as much dignity aa
if held for ransom by brigands."
ABOUT TWENTY MILLION
PEASANTS ARE STARVING
I Members of the Bussian Aristocracy-
Late in Bealizing the Extent
of the Famine.
LONDON, May 27.â Particulars received
regarding the famine in Russia confirm
the previous harrowing accounts. The
members of the Russian aristocracy seem
to have at last awakened to a full sense
of the gravity of the situation and money
is beginning to How In on all sides for the
, relief of the starving moujiks. Vnfor
. tunately charity is almost too late. The
censor at rlrsi prevented the truth from
1 being published by the Russian press.
' Now that the facts are allowed to appear
i the famine specter is stalking through the
, land. Some authorities estimate that as
, many as twenty million peasants arc
starving. The Rev. Mr. Francis, pastor of

Interest in Tuberculosis
Convention.
Cop>Ticht(vs, JV<!>, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, May 27.â The lull in politi
cal excitement during the vacation of
the Reichstag and Diet was relieved by
the assembling of the tuberculosis
convention, which has attracted ex
traordinary attention. The event is
compared with the Peace Conference,
and as indicative of the progress of fel
lowship among nations. The press
grave the congress a very enthusiastic
welcome, even the Vorwaerts seeing in
Jt the embodiment of labor in 'âhalf of
the poorest classes. This socio-politi
cal feature of the congress is com
mented upon by other papers. It was
especially emphasized by the Minister
of the Interior, Count Posadowskl-
Wehner, in his opening address, as
harmony in social legislation in Ger
many. The opening session of the con
gress was marked by great ceremony,
and brought together a large audience,
including most of the disti - uished
German and foreign medical men, and
. it was noted with satisfaction that
{^France sent a large delegation. It in
cludes the most eminent French scien
tists in this department.
The preserve of the Empress of Ger
many as patroness of the congress was
noticed with appropriate acknowledg
ment by most of the speakers. Dr.
Brouardel of Paris was the first of the
foreigners to allude gracefully to Her
Majestys' presence.
The American delegates were treated
with great attention. Surgeon Boyd,
chairman of the United states d< lega
tion, who represents the United States
Navy Department at the Congress, and
Dr Nuttall, formerly of Johns Hop
kins University, were anointed hon
orary presidents of the first section.
Dr George T. Vailghan of the Cm ted
States Marine Hospital Service read a
paper on the "Climatic Treatment of
Tuberculosis," referring particularly
to the establishment of a sanitary
ranch at Fort Stanton. N. M.. and the
treatment of sailors. Dr. yon Schwein
itz also representing the United
States, read a paper on tht; 'Serum
Treatment of Tuberculosis."
Private conversation of the delegates
in the corridors shows that much at
tention has been attracted to Dr. yon
Bchweinits'S experiments.
Emperor William has shown -* lively
interest in the congress. On Monday
he ordered the Duke of Ratiber to sub
mit a report on the preparations, and
requested that a number of delegates
be introduced to him at Potsdam Sun
t4ay His Majesty had also commanded

ITALIAN LABORERS
FOR PLANTATIONS
Ten Thousand Will Go
to the Islands.
Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, May 19.â The planters are
planning to introduce a large number of j
Italian laborers Into the cane fields ot
Hawaii. A meeting of the trustees of the
I Sugar-planters' Association was held yes
, terday, at which the groundwork for
bringing tho Italians was laid. It will be
\ submitted as soon as possible to a general
meeting.
Colonel F. A. Bchaefer has succeeded in j
bringing about this new and promising j
labor market. In the past nine months j
several litters have passed between him
and the Governmnt at Rome respecting
the matter. The Consul impressed the fact
that only the best of peasant labor was !
desirable here, and the Italian Qovern- j
mint secured from its local representa
tive all information concerning the con
tract system, treatment of laborers and
other details. A few months ago Mr.
Bchaefer Bent to the Italian Government
copies of the labor contract, labor laws
and mil descriptions of plantation ac
commodations. Attention was also drawn
to conditions as they would be when
American laws were extended over tlv;
islands and the contract system abol
ished.
By tho last mail Consul Schaefer re
ceived a letter from Home stating that
the contract and general plan were sat
isfactory. The Italian Government would
!â¢â¢ rmil "the enlistment and shipment of
unlimited numbers of the peasant class
of labor from the northern part of the
kingdom. In dealing with the laborers.
both in shipment and on the plantations
here, the Italian Government desired to
follow the same plan practiced In tlie la
bor transactions between Hawaii and
Portugal.
Mr. Bchaefer stated this morning that
if the scheme was acceptable to the
planters the laborers would be shipped
from Genoa, some by way of Japan and
some via Sydney. They will come by the '
German-Lloyd boats, some of which sail
from Italy to China and Japan, and oth
ers to Australia. Arrangements could be
made for the immigrant boats to come
on over the same routes to Honolulu.
The number of Italians tÂ«. be brought
will (Upend altogether upon the will of
the planters^ II fs primarily assured that
in 000 will be asked for to be Bhipped dur
ing the year. It is not thought that so
many caii be produced on such short no
tice, and that about 5000 will be all that
may arrive here.
Memorial Day at Marysville.
MAUYSYILLK. May 27.â Special Mem
orial day services will be held in the First
Presbyterian Church of this city to-mor
row. Corinth Post. Grand Army of the

j bamont will preach a sermon appropri
ate to the occasion. His subject will be
"Soldierly Qualities of the Apostle Paul."
On Tuesday open-air exercises will be held
on Corte* Square. The graves of the sol
diers in threo cemeteries will be decorat
ed and there will be a parade in which the
returned volunteers, the Grand Army post
and school children will take part. The
decoration of the cenotaph Bacred to the
memory of the unknown of the nation's j
dead will bo an impressive feature of the

TRADE RELATIONS
WITH GERMAN?
No Result of Present
Negotiations.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Pross.
BERLIN, May 27.â The United States
and German trade relations continued
to be discussed this week. The toy
makers of Sonneburg complain that
exports to the United States are declin
ing, and the Coburg Chamber of Com
merce has petitioned the Foreign Office,
asserting that the United States tariffs
are greatly damaging their trade. The
Chambers of Commerce of Worms and
Offenbach, interested in the leather
trade, have petitioned their representa
tive's in the Bundesrath to effect a more
just settlement of the questions at is
sue. The press pronounces the present
position to be untenable and reaction
ary. The Kreuz Zeitung admits there
will be no result from the negotiations,
as it is impossible for Germany to make
concessions.
Whitsuntide, the favorite time for
excursions into the country and moun
tains, has been marred by cold, rainy
weather. In the Hartz Mountains
heavy frosts have prevailed, and all the
mountain resorts have few holiday
makers. Emperor William and his fam
ily spent the holiday at the new palace.
Later in the week he visited the art ex
hibition and a number of Berlin stu
dios.
His Majesty's quarrel with Prince
Frederick Leopold of Prussia has
broken out afresh. Several years ago
Prlncesfl Frederick Leopold, while
skating, was immersed in a pond at
Potsdam and was carried to her home,
where Prince Frederick Leopold and
the Emperor met. The latter was in
censed at the incident and a quarrel
ensued, whereupon the Emperor, as
bead of the Hohenzollern family, ban
ished the Prince and Princess to Cassel.
The Prince, who has estates near Pots
dam, desired to return to them and has
repeatedly begged the Emperor's per
mission to do so. His Majesty has
steadily refused. The petition was re
newed during the Emperor's recent
visit to Cassel, and a refusal led to a
renewal of the quarrel.
Lieutenant Commander W. H. Beeh
ler, United States naval attache at
Rome and Vienna, was presented to
Emperor William at Potsdam on Mon
day. He was cordially welcomed by
his Majesty, who highly complimented
the American navy and illustrated the
voyage of the Oregon from the Pacific
to the West Indies and the battle of
Santiago as examples of its eeffctive
ness. His Majesty displayed marvelous
information regarding the ships and
details of the events of Santiago and
asked. "Where is 'Fighting Bob?' "
Lieutenant Beehler has been invited
to dine at the palace next Tuesday.
Admiral Tirpitz and the other German
naval officials are most cordial toward
him.

VANCOUVER, B. C, May 27.â Joshua
Moody, an American, arrived a few days
ago at the Naas River Indian village of
I Mamarok, after one of the most peculiar
experiences on record of northern adven
ture. Eight years ago Moody left the
village, an<l had not been seen until he
arrived there last week, looking wan and
emaciated after a trip <>f nearly 100 miles.
He was -an American sailor and went up
the toast from San Francisco over ten
years ago, being then v young man. He
found his way to the Indian village, and
had not been there a year before he fell
in love with one of the dusky daughters
Of Ibe north and married her. During the
two years of his life there he became cele
brated as a hunter among the tribe and
frequently headed expeditions into the in
terior.
One day he went out alone. That was
eight yeariÂ« ago. and since that time he
was thought to be dead. For a few
months intermittent search was made for
him and then be was forgotten. As a
matter of fact he was carried away a
slave by Indians in Alaska and lived with
them until three months ago.
"I had been out hunting for several
days," said Moody in telling his story,
"and one night camped at the side of a
stream. I had seen the smoke from In
dian iires two or three days previously,
but thought nothing of it. Alaskan tribes
had never come down that far before.
All at once three Indians ran up and
bound me. They used me very roughly,
and at first 1 thought they would kill me
right then.'. I was dragged away to the
chiefs camp, a mile from there, and from
that time on was made his servant. Close
watch was kept that I did not escape un
til we were well away from the Naas
country. We traveled nearly lUOO miles
toward" the Peace River district.
"My life as a slave of the chief did not
contain many phases but what I was ta
millar with. In a year or two the people
all treated me with respect and the chief
came tt> regard me with marked friendli
ness. The Knowledge that 1 naturally had
of medicine was a decided help. Soon the
chief offered me the hand of bis daugh
ter in marriage. I protested that 1 had
one wife already, but that made no dif
ference, and until a rear ago I was the
principal advisor of the chief. Then dis
ease broke out among the tribe and to
an extent they blamed me for not staying
its ravages.
"At the first of this year I resolved to
get away, and at the end of March 1
started tor the coast. The trip took me
a couple of months, and all the way I had
to pick up enough wild food to keep alive.
The cold weather was the principal dif
flculty and living a great part of the time
alone was trying. 1 have just heard of
the Klondike, and will probably go there.
"Though the natives in the Peace River
country got gold nuggets in several of the
streams, I never expected to get away. Vo
1 bothered very little beyond mere sur
face investigations."
Moody is now living with his first wife.

MILLER OPPOSED
10 GOOD ROADS
May Be Commissioner
Maude's Secretary
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, May 27.â The an
nouncement said to have been semi
officially made at Los Angeles,
where Governor Gage now is. that
J. L. Maude, the new Highway
Commissioner, would appoint Assembly
man J. 11. Miller of Los Angeles his sec
retary has occasioned considerable com
ment here. As a member of the last Leg
islature Miller was the strongest antag
onist of the good roads bill, which em
bodied the best ideas of the department of
highways for a term covering months of
research and experience. In this attitude
of opposition it was declared that he was
acting at the request of the Los Angeles
Board of Supervisors, which was violently
opposed to the measure.
Miller was particularly emphatic in his
opposition to the bill providing that one
half of all road moneys raised each year
should be spent in permanent improve
ments of a character approved by the
advanced science of road building. It
would seem, therefore, that the very last
man who should be selected to promote
the good roads movement in this State
would be Assemblyman J. H. Miller of
LJoa Angeles.
But the announcement as it comes from
Los Angeles occasions small surprise with
all the discussion that has followed it.
During the early part of the session of the
Legislature Miller voted for R. N. Bulla
for United States Senator, but toward the
last he turned about and cast his ballot
for D. M. Burns. Naturally the belief pre
vails here that if there is any truth in the
published story from Los Angeles Miller
will receive his job through the influence
of Burns, notwithstanding the improprie
ty of the selection in view of Miller's well
known attitude against the cause of good
roads.
Commissioner Maude says that Miller
is not a candidate for the office and so
developments are awaited by the capital
habitues. It is int?restlng to know that
the retiring Commissioners of the De
partment of Highways are opposed to
such an appointment as that reported
from Los Angeles.

GEORGE WADE IS
HELD FOR MURDER
Sequel to the Tragedy
on the Australia.
â¦
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, May 19.â William Gil
lespie, the waiter who was shot by
George Wade, a cook, on board the
steamer Australia as she was about to
discharge the pilot on Tuesday even
ing, died at the Queen's Hospital at 2:30
p. m. yesterday. This was just twenty
one hours after the tragedy.
When the men were carried ashore
both were placed in the hospital. The
murderer, having been only stunned,
was shortly afterward removed to the
police station, where the entry, "For
investigation," was made opposite his
name. Wade said he was sorry he had
hurt Gillespie, as he was "his best
friend." He was kept in ignorance of
the desperate condition of his victim
until, after the end, he was charged in
the Police Court with murder. This was
yesterday mornjng.
Wade showed a feeble gait as he was
conducted from the cells below into the
courtroom by Detective Kaapa. Aa he
was settling into a seat in nt of
Judge Peterson he staggered. The big
mulatto's head was bandaged.
Deputy Marshal Hitchcock read the
charge of murder in the first decree to
the prisoner. The same official then
suggested that the case go over until
after the return of the Australia, on
the Sth of June. Wade was asUed if
this were not the best course.
"I suppose so," was his reply.
Then for a few moments Wade was
silent and motionless. In slow tones he
broke the silence with the query, "Is
that fellow dead?"

On being told of the fact and time of
Gillespie's death, he remarked:
"I am awfully sorry."
He was venturing to say more when
Deputy Marshal Hitchcock checked
him with * the usual cautions. Any
thing that he might now utter waa
liable to be used against him as evi
dence.
Immediately after the death of Gil
lespie a Coroners' jury was impaneled.
After having been sworn over Gilles
pie's body, the jury postponed the in
quest until after the return of the Aus
tralia. There is not a person in Hono
lulu who saw the crime.
Poor Gillespie on the way to the hos
pital only murmured that he had not
deserved so cruel a fate, as he had but
tried to restore peace between the two
quarreling men. Wade and "Sidney,"
the butcher. He also spoke of his?
mother, hoping she would believe he
was "all right."
No ante-mortem deposition was ob
tained from the dying man. He had ral
lied wonderfully the morning before his
death, but relapsed into a sinking con
dition and could not be disturbed â not
even to leave his testimony for the
avenging law.
The funeral took place from the hos
pital to the Catholic cemetery yester
day. Rev. Father Valentin conducted
the services. Employes of W. G. Irwiu
& Co. (limited), agents of the Oceanic
Steamship Company, together with
many friends the dead man had known,
here, attended the obsequies. Many
floral emblems were contributed.
These, with the coffin, -were photo
graphed at the grave to form a sad
memento for the bereaved mother.
Mrs. Elizabeth K. Wilder, mother of
Miss Helen Wilder, Avho on board the
Australia called the police officers up
the ladder again when the shooting oc
curred, sent a beautiful cross.
New Laws in Texas.
AUSTIN. Texas. May 27.â The Texas
Legislature adjourned sine die at noon to
day, after having been in session contin
uously for 137 days. It enacted- a drastic
anti-trust law; a law making it a felony
for an employe, agent or any one con
nected with a railway company to give
a rebate or discriminate in rates; a law
creating a State tax commission and a
law authorizing a number of trunk rail
roads in the State to consolidate with
connecting lines. Under the provisions of
these consolidation bills fully 500 miles of
new railroad must be built in Texas rjth
in the next two years. Over two hundred
now laws were passed in all.

THE CONFERENCE A FAILURE.
THE Peace Conference will be abortive. Mr.
White has already sufficiently admitted its
failure.
j:. | .- this outcome are as plain as the re- i
suit itself Since the publicists of Europe ceased to '^
write subjunctively of the United States, and the
"ifs' 1 and "buts" of De Tocqueville were replaced by
the past tense and potential mood in which Professor
has told of what we have done and can do. the
example of the United States has worked certain
formations in several European Governments.
A free people, guaranteed the right to bear arms, in
creasing to seventy millions, with a little army of only
n. presented an example that encouraged the
friends of free institutions everywhere. Heretofore
the United States have been cited as proof that not
mies but larger liberties were needed by the
the Old World for the defense of their in
tions and their territory.
Unfortunately, the people of this republic have not
permitted, or have not seen fit. to properly ap
preciate the value of their policy to themselves or of
their example to the rest of the world. From some
source a sinister influence has gone abroad inoculat
ing them with a thirst for military glory, for power.
for â  . be ruled rather than for citizens to
rule themselves. At present, by these causes, our past
example is obscured: it is in eclipse. We have per
manently more than doubled our standing army.
with the immediate prospect of quadrupling it. We
are paying the usual high price of glory in war taxes.
which there is no prospect of abating. We are well
n the path the farther end of which" has been
reached by the European nations. We are feared by
the weak and hated by the strong.
Wi might have been present in the Peace Con- 1
ferencc in plain clothes, advising the nations to de
velop larger freedom for their people from the germ
of parliamentary government, which all of them on
tht Continent except Russia have taken from u<
We might have pointed to the vast consumptive
power of our lightly taxed people and of their cor
relative power of production, which sends a vast,
wealth-gaining surplus into the markets of the Â«
To the cry of the older countries that markets n â¢Â«
be blown open with gunpowder and trad( |
by the sword, we could have pointed to th<
conquests of our commerce and the mighty m<
ure of results we have achieved by peace by following
the art- of construction and abjuring those of de
struction.
But every American knows that we are not present
in that character, nor able to point with pride to those
thing- Quite to the contrary. Our flag floats over
slaughter in far lands, and the press and the commer
cial spirit raise the new cry that trade follows the
flag â not where it goes in peace, but where it goes
in war. We send military delegates in company with
our diplomats to consult about peace. We are a new
terror let loose in the world, and the awful power
we have accumulated in a century and a quarter by
peaceful pursuits inspires exactly the same feeling in
the world as did the trembling of the earth under the
hard heels of the armies of Xerxes, Alexander.
Caesar, Gengis Khan and Napoleon.
It is well to look facts in the face. We are no
longer propagandists of the principles of the Declara
tion of Independence, but we are abroad in the world
standing on the mere physical brutalities of the Os
ti nd manifesto. The temples of the Prince of Peace
are closed and that of Janus is opened. The declara
tion of Colonel Denby, Commissioner to the Philip
pine?, that having the power to do so we propose by
aggression and conquest to take by force, wherever we
find it. whatever we think will be to our material ad
vantage, is .t frank expression of our present atti
tude to the rest of the world. Our old policy has
demonstrated, in a -hort century and a quarter, a brief
forenoon in the life of a nation, its wisdomin its re
suit- in the progress we have made. The opposite
policy upon which we have entered is a novelty to us,
but its results may be studied in the imperial experi
ments which have gone before.
In the conference we have nothing to offer in our
former character as a non military republic. We are
there just as the other glory-seeking nations are there.
Befpre us and before their vision rises the glorious
panorama of Asiatic splendor. The aroma of the
bloom islands of the tropical sea is in every nostril.
Populations of peaceful people, incapable of defense,
numbering three-quarters of a billion souls, bend to
their task*, while their countries welter in sunshine
and invite conquest and spoliation. The weak every
where shade their eye> and scan the horizon in vain
for a friend. Justice has no temple in which they can'
have a day in court against the strong. In the con
ference opped from pleading their cause.
It is doubtful if even the cruelties of war will i c
checked by agreement. The world's sky is full of
hawks, and the dove of peace flutters to the jungle
for safety.
Instead of illustrating Christian civilization by re
turning armies to the arts of peace, it is probable that
the twentieth century will dawn in widespread slaugh
ter, or will witness the disarmament of the weak and
a movement in retrogression that will retard the rise
ot man into greater freedom and its consequent hap
piness. Americans will wish it were .otherwise and
will deplore the agency of the republic in the per
petration of wholesale bloodshed, but they are help
less in the hands of a sinister influence which hopes to
follow conquest, whip in hand, to secure the profits of
involuntary labor in lands where white men can live
only as masters and rulers of subjects.
DOES HE NEED (\ MONUMENT ?
OL'R esteemed contemporary, the Evening Post.
which of late has devoted its editorial page to
vagrom fancies and curious statistics, put to
itself the question some time ago, "Does Dewey need
a monument?" and after wrestling with it announced
on Friday that he does not.
The conclusion is just. Admiral Dewey needs no
monument, either in his back yard, his front yard or
on board his ship. Indeed, it is difficult to see what
he would do with one were it presented to him. Such
things are useful neither to private citizens nor to
naval officers. A man with a monument thrust upon
him would be about as embarrassed as the peasant
\\a-~ with the elephant.
Had the Post contented itself with announcing its
conclusion on the subject all would have been well
with it. but in an evil moment it permitted itself to
indulge in the rashness of trying to make an argu
ment. It asserts, in the first place, that a shaft, or a
statue, or a monument, in bronze or brass, could not
enhance the fame of the Admiral or render more en
during the honor conferred by a great people. His
name and his fame, it says, are enshrined in the
hearts of his countrymen, and he will live in the pages
of history beyond the term of crumbling stone or
metals corrupted by the rust of ages.
All of which is most excellent fooling. "Because
he needs no praise, shall we be dumb?" Had the peo
ple never praised Dewey. never sounded their appre
ciation of his valor and his patriotism, his deed would
ere this have been forgotten. A feeling or a thought
which is never recalled or never expressed soon fades
from memory. It is only by giving it expression in
enduring forms through the medium of letters or of
art that any sentiment of the brain or feeling of the
heart is perpetuated among men.
There were heroes before Agamemnon, but no
Homer sang their glory, and the world knows them
not. The hero to whose hqnor no song has been
raised, no monument erected, is as obscure in death
as the nameless slaves that served in the cellars of
"the courts where Jamshyd reveled and drank deep."!
Xo hero needs a monument, but a people whose na-l
tional life must be fed with noble memories need alii
forms of monuments, that those memories may be j
forever fresh in their minds and in their hearts.
Pursuing its folly with a fatuous persistency, the
Post goes on to say we have no artists, sculptors or
architects with the genius requisite to provide a
monument worthy of Dewey, and adds: "Let us at
tain to the genius of building monuments to heroes
before we risk the failure that may subject the hero
thus 'honored' to the scorn of future generations not
50 enthusiastic as ourselves over "deeds of heroism'
that may appear less heroic in the pages of a cold, pas
sionless, impartial and accurate history of the event."
The argument that we must not erect monuments
until we have learned to erect them is equivalent to
the old grandmother's advice to the boy not to go
imo the water until he learned to swim. As a matter
of fact we have in this country many artists quite ca
pable of designing and constructing monu
mental works of the highest class. Several of the
kind erected in the Eastern States within the past few
years are equal in magnitude, dignity and artistic
beauty to any recently raised in Europe.
The Pacific Coast needs a monument to Dewey as
an expression of regard for his glorious service to
the republic, as a memorial to future generations of
| his patriotism and of the honor in which it is now j
i held, and as a stimulus to artists and to genius. The
whole republic needs the monument, and it will be
erected.
APPOINTMENT OF SENATORS.
IT is undeniable that in every State in the Union
â¢ rts are being quietly made to commit Federal
'or-, on the score of friendship, to the re
il of uniform precedents and the violation of clear
distinct constitutional law. by seating Matt
â â . . under the appointment of the Governor of
rtsylvania. after he had failed of an election by the
Joint committee of the Legislature of that State.
It i- hard for intelligent and patriotic citizens t.o
conceive that their great national council, filled with
the representatives of autonomous American States,
occupying a legislative position analogous to the ju
dicial distinction of the Supreme Court of the United
.States, in the plan of its construction and in its his
torical dignity powerful and grand beyond compari
son, should be even suspected of an intention to sac
rifice its honor for persona! considerations. Such a
calamity is not to be lightly anticipated. But there
?re many indications that it is believed to be pos
sible. Should it actually occur, it will be accepted
throughout the world as positive evidence that the
Federal Senate is "a millionaire club." and as con
clusively proving the necessity of placing the power
of selection directly in the hands of the people.
Every Senator swears to maintain the constitution
of his country, and, if there are degrees of solemnity
it] the assumption of obligations, his oath binds him
with pre-eminent sanctity. And. on the cases in
which Federal Senators can be appointed, the con
j stitution is free of any trace of ambiguity and as
pellucid as crystal. Ry article 11, section ;?. it pro
. vides that when "during the recess of the Legisla
ture," "by resignation or otherwise." a vacancy oc
curs, it may be filled by the "temporary appointment"
of the Governor of the State "until the next meeting
of the Legislature, which shall then fill such va
cancy."
This language speaks for itself. It needs no ex
pository treatment. It cannot be evaded or doubted
by any man of ordinary intelligence, nor its binding
force upon the conscience of a Senator pledged to
obey it avoided by any quibble or by any sophistry.
['n the records of a hundred and twelve years, so far
as we are advised, no disobedience to its mandate is
to be found. When Senator George Reede of Dela
ware resigned in 1793, and in January. 1794, the Leg
islature of that State adjourned without electing his
successor, the gubernatorial appointee. Kensy
Johns; was rejected, because there had been an op
portunity to elect. When Lamuan of Connecticut
reached the end of his term, March 3. 1825, and was
pointed the next day to succeed himself, he was
refused his seat because it was held that, when a regu
lar term expired, there was no vacancy, within the
meaning of the constitution, even though the Legis
re was in recess. In the Corbett case there was a
Federal Senator to be elected, and when a session of
the Legislature of Oregon began a joint convention
could not be held because the Senate only was or
ganized and the Assembly failed even to choose tem
porary officers. In this instance, if ever, there was an
opportunity to claim an exceptional situation which
justified the appointment by the Governor. But, as
in the Delaware precedent, there had been a chance to
elect, thrown away through legislative perversity, and
Corbett was denied admission by a vote of 50 to 19.
The most remarkable fact about this last evidence
of consistency and of obedience to constitutional law
by the upper house of Congress is that Matt Quay
himself is to be ranged with the majority. He was
then a Senator from Pennsylvania. Senator Morgan
: of Alabama, who, like Senator Perkins of California,
considered that the special facts of the Corbett ap
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 28. 1899.
pointment took it out of the category of the uniform
precedents, was outspoken, as is usual with him, in
ranking himself with the minority. The Congres
sional Record shows that, on February 28. 1898, the
Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections re
ported the resolution declaring that Corbett was not
entitled to admission. This resolution was adopted
by the vote already stated. Senators Morgan and
Quay were paired, and neither actually voted, which
was legally and fully equivalent to a vote by Senator
Quay against Corbett.
On .March 3. 1899. the regular term? of Senators
White. Quay, Gray and Cannon, respectively of Cali
fornia, of Pennsylvania, of Delaware and of Utah, ex
pired, and, in each. of these States, the Legislature in
joint convention was then voting for a Senator, and
a deadlock existed which remained unbroken until
adjournment. On the authority of the Delaware
cr.se. as the term of each of these four Senators ex
pired by limitation, even if the several Legislatures
had not been in session, there could have been no
"vacancy" that it was within gubernatorial authority
to fill. But, as there was no "recess." and the four
Legislatures simply failed to elect, within the distinct
provisions of the constitution no appointment could
be made without palpable usurpation, and no such ap
pointment could be indorsed without dishonor. It is
true that the Senate of the United States resembles
every other legislative body in the fact that it is the
j sole judge of the qualifications of its own members,
'. but it has never been understood that, because it pos
sessed the power, it was justified in violating con
stitutional obligations. It is possible that it might
seat a subject of Great Britain, or of Russia, or a
Tagal, who had never even declared an intention to
be naturalized, and without one of the qualifications
i prescribed in terms by the constitution. Any of these
acts would be no more and possibly less unprincipled
and injurious than the ratification of the gubernatorial
; appointment of Matt Quay or Dan Burns.
Matt Quay at least possesses ability and experience
and he has evidently laid up social capital with his fcl
; low members. Dan Burns is a paragon of incapacity
and of saturated political corruption, whose record
alone amounts to a positive disqualification for any
office. But. without reference to the distinctions be
tween the two men. to seat either through the as
sumption of legislative powers by a State executive
would be a revolutionary proceeding that presump
i tively is impossible in the Federal Senate.
THE BOERS AND ThJE BRITISH-
WERE not public interest in foreign affairs so
distracted from one quarter of the globe to
another by imbroglios in China, Samoa, the j
Philippines and Central Africa, there would b^ much I
both of amusement and instruction to he gained by
studying, or at least closely observing and following,
the course of events in the Transvaal. The mutual
relations of the British and the Boers, when the char
acteristics and the comparative strength of the two
people are considered, are about as interesting as any
thing of the sort to be found in all the pages of his
tory.
It was with a zealous willingness to take up "the j
white manY burden" the British went to the land of
the Bners. They found there a people who were not ;
developing the rich resources of their soil, a people j
so barbarou?*hey would rather take life easy in the
herding of cattle than to work hard in digging gold.
By way* of bearing their burdens for them the British
got possession of the gold mines and then tried to
i get possession of the country also. Just there they
; struck a snag. The Boer preferred to carry his own |
; burden, and even showed a readiness to fight and fight
1 hard before he would let himself be relieved of it.
As the case stands now the Boer has the burden.
He runs the government, and the Britisher has noth
ing to do except to work. He is relieved of all care
and responsibility in the Transvaal. The- Boer prac
-1 tices upon him a policy of '"benevolent assimilation"
as soon as he comes into the country. He is allowed, ;
: encouraged and even gently enforced to pay taxes.
His children are' paternally compelled to learn the
Boer language. He is himself educated in Boer cus
toms, given the wholesome discipline of Boer laws.
j and in every way carefully guarded, nursed and
trained to be fit to take part in the government when
the Boer in his wisdom sees fit to grant it.
British settlers in the Transvaal arc getting, in
fact, just what the British in other lands are dealing
out to the natives. Yet they do not like it. They are
eager to help bear the burden. They desire to under
take some of the laborious responsibilities of holding
j office and administering public affairs. They cannot
! see how well off they are in a region where every
thing is done for them, and where they have nothing
I to do except pay taxes and learn to speak South Af
; rican Dutch.
<)f course the situation cannot long endure. The
] Boers are but a feeble folk in comparison with the
I race whom they have undertaken to hold in leading
strings. Their little primitive republic has been sur-
I rounded by the swelling and advancing tide of British
! aggression, and sooner or later it must be submerged.
Its doom is as plainly written as was that of the pas
' toral Spanish Californians in the old days when the j
first American adventurers crossed the mountains
'"and discovered the richness of their land. Â»
No amount of courage, patriotism or dogged stub
bornness can protect a people in this generation who
stand against civilization. The Boers must either
j swim with the current or perish. That much is sure;
but, nevertheless, they are making a good fight and
giving the world its most interesting lesson on the
subject of "burden bearing" that is now being taught
in any part of the world.
The three Judges of the criminal division of the
Superior Court have announced that, unless the Su
pervisors furnish the wherewithal to feed men en
gaged in jury duty, they will hear no more criminal
; cases. Next thing we know relief committees for the
succor of starving jurors will be all the go in San
Francisco.
The direction of the fence that Collis P. Hunting
< ton is trying to build around the earth will have to
ibe changed again. The Supreme Court has just de
cided that there are several very valuable sections of
land in Los Angeles County that the Southern Pa
cific Railway will have to yield up.
The dispatches announce that Nicaragua is ani
mated by an intense hatred of Americans. There i
have been instances where fear proved to be the only
; highway to popularity, and Nicaragua seems to
, have been looking for a sound thrashing for some
time.
Oom Patil desires reform in the Transvaal, and the
British in that republic desire reform also. Such being
the case, it is a pity that the reform which each de- j
j sires is some law providing a means for running the
other out of the country.
â¢What a godsend it would be to California if its !
Legislatures could be made up of members from the '
Cuban army! Uncle Sam has been trying hard re
cently to give each of them his share of $3,000,000, but
not one sems to be out for the stuff. J
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
PROTEST AGAINST EXAMINATIONS.
To the Editor of The Call: As a parent of four children, all of whom attend
th-e public schools, I wish to submit a vigorous protest againsi the rehabilitation
of the ancient "tried and found wantlng"system of examinations in our public
schools.
In last Monday's Call there appeared a communication from one of the oldest
and best-known teachers, every word of which must haVe struck a responsive
chord in the heart and mind of all parents who in any degree follow the work
done in our public schools.
It happens that I was a pupil in one of the high schools of this State at the
time of the change from promotion by examination to promotion by the recom
mendation s of the teacher. The principal of our lush school at the time was a
man from Columbia College, and he was the direct Instigator of the change in
our city. He appeared before the Board of Education and urged that the teach
er in the grammar and lower grades be made personally responsible for the
pupils promoted from his or her class, He contended that promotions made on
the records, monthly reviews, classroom work and general proriciency of the
child during the year is of far more satisfaction to the teacher about to receive
the child than is the record that he has received (perhaps In return for honest
work, perhaps not) 60 per cent on ten questions.
The principal of whom I speak raised our high school to a standard which
caused it to be one of the first whose graduates were accredited to the uni
versity, and when I afterward entered the public schools of our city as a member
of its corps of teachers 1 found the standard of < xcellence eh vated by the doing
away with examinations. There was less "working for credits." mere work t<>
satisfy the demands of the teacher, who was the one to be satisfied from day t I
day and month to month. Another phase of the subject ta nic Is thai as a pupil
I have seen boys and girls who had done wretched work during the year succeed
in passing an examination by having salient points jotted down on the linen
cuffs, on the under side of an innocent appearing white apron and divers other
â¢ways (veritably did the cheating become a science), so that even under the never
resting vigilance of the keenest teacher did they gain t!?e required per cent; while
right alongside of them sat children who had done good, honest work, but who
became so nervously wrought up that they bungled their answers and made fail
ures of their examinations, and the record of their year's work and their teacher's
testimony hafl to be called in to pass them to the grade for which they were- in
reality well prepared.
As a mother of children, each, one of whom has always ranked among the
"honoraries," I fully realize that a most unfortunate fact of the case is that
both boys and girls are passing through the stage of most rapid physical de
velopment during the very years devoted to their grammar school work, and
that while to keep up a steady, honest devotion to their work from month to
mftnth does not harm them, six weeks of the feverish, nervous strain which
those children are now under, not to mention the days of examination, is actual
robbery from them of good red blood, which goes to supply the forced draught
they are now under, and which, after their year of study, belongs to them to
"have and to hold."
I believe in the schools being conducted for the "greatest good to the greatest
number," and d<> not believe in punishing the many because a few succeed in
being promoted who should not be. In place of being, as President JBergerot
claimed (according to the newspapers! that the order was a Btep forward, it
certainly is a leap of several steps backward in the work of education.
The trouble is not there. When Superintendent Webster shall have been able
to familiarize himself with the work of such teachers as do not receive the
commendation of their principals, and the Board of Education shall as valiantly
"back him up" as they have in this examination proposition, then will the city
be supplied with good teachers. Until then it will not help matters, any to add
to the burdens the poor children and their parents, as well as the many
faithful teachers, already have to bear.
If to have these examinations this year is inevitable, then at least should the
year's average on monthly examinations, which have doubtless in almost if not
â¢ quite every instance been good monthly tests, stand as a half in making up the
required percentage. Sincerely yours, A MOTHER.
THE TEACHERS' SIDE.
To the Editor of The Callâ Some daily papers are saying that the proposed
examination of pupils in our public schools reveals loose methods of teaching,
and that the course of study has been ignored; that now pupils are being pushed
to make up for the deficiency of instructors.
While this may be true of a few it is a libel upon the large majority of teach
ers. As a rule they are hardworking and conscientious. They give more time to
their classes and make greater efforts than is required by their contract. I think
the poorest of them has never been known to sit with her feet on a desk and
read the morning paper for even fifteen minutes after time to begin work, a prac
tice not unknown In any other depa tment of the municipal government.
The real cause of the difficulty over the coming examinations, as I have been
informed by many teachers, is the document known as the "Course of Study."
As it came at first from tho hands of Superintendent Webster it embraced work
in the great m Tiber of books which the old board of malodorous memory desired
to assist the I- ok men to force the people to buy. Besides this, Mr. Webster
was fresh from a high school class and had no knowledge of the capacity of lit
tle children, and since then has developed no aptitude for r, aching down to them.
The department was paralyzed when this course of study firs! reached the
schools, and It was found necessary to revise it before anything could be done.
A second revision had to be made later, and this later one is the circular al
which so much Is now being said. It was sent to the schools at the beginning of
this year and all went to work with might and main to do the best they could
under it.
There were certain pages marked inthe "Advanced Arithmetic"' and "Bail* y's
Mental" and otner textbooks which were to be taught. If a teacher had worked
all day on arithmetic alone she could scarcely have covered the ground, and she
could certainly not have made the little pint jugs before her hold the gallon-sized
problems, for they were at least two years in advance of their ability to reason
What was true of arithmetic was also true pf geography in the lower ir-
They were required to study the earth as a whole, learn its motions, cause of
seasons, zones, climates, winds, ocean currents, products and occupations of in
habitants of the different zones and the different races of men. together with
much more which was as abstract to them as the effect upon the latitude of
Greenwich of the vibrations of the north pole is to most men. But the woman al
the desk took up the â â¢Teachers' Burden" ami faithfully did her best to cram all
this down the resisting throats of the children. Then. she presented :. !i <tti to the
principal, who piously examined them upon this ÃBprofitable work and found it
had been well done.
Then the teacher gave a little timeâ %vhat little, was leftâ to the easy things
all about us which the children could grasp, and supposed she would have
llvo weeks more tor good sensible bard work to fit them up for another step up
the educational ladder, when the thunderbolt fell in the shape of an order for an
examination. In two weeks or thereabouts she must review all the year's
work, for that winch had been dropped. Mother Nature, kindly to the race, had
permitted to drop out us utterly as n" washed away by the Sacramento in
Rood. She must roll up the balls and wjlly-nilly force them down the throats
of her pupils. For one thing, she, the teacher, is to be Judged by what can be
got from these pupils of bers. Can teachers rightfully be held responsible for
not being able to teach our children what they are too immature to grasp? No;
not though "several principals," with each a fad of her own. has accepted the
fails of others for the pleasure of getting her own particular one into this pre
cious course of study.
Give us a course of study made by one man or one woman who understands
children from the little ones upâ not from the top down.
Then teachers are aware how nervous children are and that a very little thing
upsets them. A new teacher is to be put over them while they are passing this
test and one for B '.car accustomed to children a year older than they. A year
is a very long time in the life of a eh d am', means more change thati any of us
who are not t.achers can realize. With his own teacher the child would be much
more apt to tell what he knows, which might be supposed to be what the board
Is after.
This examination will be a strain upon the painstaking children which will
do them infinite haim. And what will it be for the teacher! Faithful, intelligent
work is a thankless task! a. TEACHER.
TWO KINDS OF TREASON.
To the Editor of The Call: There is good food for. thought and reflection in
the editorial appearing in to-day's Call entitled "What Is Treason?" ]t is partic
ularly suggestive of two thingsâ impending danger and the duty of all truly patri
otic citizens to unite in averting it. So wildly enthusiastic over the conquest of
foreign territory are the imperialists of to-day that many of them seem to consid
er it their duty to denounce every man opposed to such a policy as a "traitor."'
By such denunciations the champions of aggression hope to stifle opposition to
the grali game and insure smooth sailing for the greedy, unpatriotic jingoes
who are willing to see every sacred principle of international honor sacrificed for
the sake of their own personal aggrandizement. But it is not supposable that
any honest opponent Of "criminal aggression" who has the courage of his con
victions will be bluffed or intimidated by the senseless cry of treason to the Gov
ernment. The real patriot is composed of sterner stutf.
Now. in my humble judgment, there are two kinds of treason. One kind con
sists of giving aid and comfort to an enemy when our country is engaged in a
just war with a foreign power, or in putting down a rebellion within its own
borders. The other kind of treason consists in repudiating the fundamental prin
ciples on which our government is -founded and seeking t<> substitute theref
for* Igh policy In accordance with the most absolute despotisms of the century.
That is precisely what our wild-eyed critics are doing, though they may no) be
aware of it. Some of them doubtless are ignorant of what man's natural rights
consist of. and they imagine that the code of morals for an aggregation of men
called a nation may safely be different from that which all civilized persons
recognize as binding between man and man. But some of the most vehement
shouters for Imperialistic rule are men of experience In legislation and familiar
with international laws. They knowâ or certainly ought to knowâ that the very
essence of popular government is the theory that Governments derive their Hist
powers from the consent of the governed and that a departure from that fun
damental proposition means that our sbip of state is drifting away from her
moorings into the dangerous waters of perpetual war. with all the horrors per
taining to such an abnormal condition. Such men are guilty of treason to liberty,
and when they charge us with disloyalty we should hurl the charge back into
their faces and promptly show who are the real enemies of our country's best
interests. No man who is loyal to liberty, to free government, to equal rights
for all with special privileges to none, to even-handed justice between nations as
well as between individuals, can be disloyal to his country if his Government
Is worth having. Therefore those who charge the opponents of imperialism
with being guilty of treason either do not know what treason is or they admit
by implication that the Government Is a fraud.
I hope and believe The Call will stand by its anti-imperialistic guns through
thick and thin, come what may. The ri^ht must prevail. RALPH HOYT.

WHEN THE BOYS COME HOME.
To the Editor of Tho Callâ Sir: I have been observing with considerable sat
isfaction and pride the extensive preparations that are being made to give the
First California Volunteers a right royal reception upon their return from Ma
nila. This is right and proper and is only bestowing due honor upon our brave
boys, which they have BO heroically earned on those inhospitable shores. I do not
believe that anything is too g,,<u\ for them; but at the same time 1 would like to
call public attention through your valuable journal to the fad thai "there are
others." On the armed transport Buffalo, which recently arrived in New fork
by way of the Suez canal from Manila, there were several hundred blue jack
ets and marines. They are the men of 1>â¢ wey. who assisted in the destruction
of Admiral Montejo'a fleet of warships and made it possible to land our infan
try. They arp the rvien who saved our Western coast several unpleasant half
hours by the annihilation of lha Spanish Meet of the Pacific, and they held what
they had taken imtiloiir Government sent to their aid transports laden with
soldiers ami supplies. An ; these lads at least a hundred shipped from San
Francisco and neighboring town*, my son being of those from this city. Why not
accord to them a AttlnK reception mid present them also with proper medals."
That would not detraci from the glory of our fighting First, but would show a
larger public generosity and at the same time make many a sailor boy feel
happy. Yours truly, JAMES W. COLLINS, 54 Sixth street.

PEOPLESâ H. S., City. "People" is
used when the more exact term, race,

as "the people of J3nglan,d;"' or in the

in Locksley Hall, has: "With the stand
ards of the peoples plunging thro' the

"And he Bald unto m. . Thou must
prophesy, again before many peoples and
nations and tongues and kings.' â 
LAND TO. SOLDIERSâ A. S., Oakland,
Cal. A soldier who served in the war with
Spain is entitled to take up Government

that he may have the time he served in

the same steps to S'^cure the land thatr
â¢any other citizen would have to take in
the United States Land Office. A soldier
has no authority to sell his right to take

YESTERDAY AFTERNOON Miss Frisco started out on a voyage of dis-
:r}', determined to find the store where one can furnish a home with
dainty ana lasting furniture and carpets without the need of a lavish ex-
enditure of money. Coming down toward Mission street she met a bevy of June
brides, and they said: "Come with us to Pattosien's," and she said, "I will."
low happy she was and claimed a great discovery on her part â a big model
Furniture Exposition Building out in the Mission â nothing like it in San
rancisco. So, taking off her hat and seating herself in one of the large rockers
in the furnished cottage on the first floor, Miss Frisco told the brides that after
seeing all these beautiful houseftirnishings so tastefully displayed, she would let
some good chap propose to her and have a nice flat or cottage furnished by Pat-
tosien's, and live happy ever after.

JURORS' FEES QUESTIONED.
City Attorney Finds No Law Author
izing the Board of Supervisors
to Act.
In an opinion rendered yesterday by
City and County Attorney Lane to the
Board of Supervisors he advises the
board to refuse to audit the" demands of
grand jurors and trial jurors acting in
criminal cases, as he fails to rind in the
Btatutes any authorization for making
Jurors' fees a charge against the city
treasury. In conclusion he says:
"The question is one of such confusion
and doubt that it has seemed to me. in
the interest of the city, that this matter
should be referred to the courts for a
final determination, and to this end, as a
matter of legal form, I advise that you
reject one or more demands of each class
which are otherwise regular in form upon
the cold ground (hat they are without
warrant in law. This course will doubt
less lead to a speedy discovery of the ex
tent to which the Supreme Court Intended
the language of the Hilton-Curry decision
to have application."
Circus Continued.
Commencing yesterday (Saturday)
<',]<-n Park will remain open two days
each week, and the circus performance
will be continued. Miss Elise St. Leon,
the wonderful circus rider, has pre
pared a number of new and difficult
feats of horsemanshiD which she will
introduce for the first time to-morrow
and Sunday. Acrobatic tumbling and
grouping, bounding rope experts, light
and heavy balancing, trapeze perform
ance and trained animals will be some
of the principal features of the bill.
The funny clown will also be there in
some of the riding numbers for the
amusement of the children.
EDSON'S VOTE STILL
SOUGHT BY MR. HERRIN
j
Offered Rebates on His Freight
If He Would Stand In.
Huntington's Original Plan to Control the
Railroad Commission Was Balked by
the Northern Member.
CHAPTER by chapter the story of W. F. Herrin's manipulation 'of , the
State Board of Railroad Commissioners is becoming public property. It's
a tale of blunders, so far as Mr. Heroin's connection goes,' and 1 a tale of
gold bricks as well, for Mr. Herrin has blundered, sadly, and ,' up in the big
building at Market and Montgomery streets it is > whispered : among the
"fourteen heads of departments" that Mr. Huntington, Mr. Herrin's employer,
is quite as well aware of that fact as is Mr. Herrin himself.
Clouded as it has been by a series of political miscalculations, the scheme of \
procedure Mr. Herrin has been pursuing in his relations with his men Friday on
the board (Blackstock and Laumeister), has been difficult to understand.; Mr.
Blackstock's first resolution was one of the things not- easy of . comprehension. â 
Its glaring reflections upon Judge Morrow and the remarkable procedure it pro
posed in applying on behalf of the State for the dismissal of â  the grain
rate suits in which the State was defendant, won/ not the things expected of
the head of the Southern Pacific's law department, nor, for, that- matter, was
Mr. Blackstock's second resolution. The fact trfat the- resolution. did not rescind
the old grain rate schedule as well as the resolution that provided â > for it was
another thing that one of Mr. Huntington's â  self-made heads of â  departments
should not have overlooked. . â¢
In the light of most recent developments,' however, there is some excuse for
Mr. Herrin's infractions of Huntington's tenets. Right down at â  the bottom
a mistake in simple fractions is to blame for it all. If the head of the law de
partment had been afflicted with anything in the line of "higher education, he
would have known that two-thirds do not make a whole, under any circum
stances, and knowing this he would never have thought, he had the whole Board
of Commissioners on his payroll when he had only two of them signed.
Mr. Herrin's original scheme for the control of the board was unique. It
was hatched just before the campaign began last June, and contemplated' tying
up all three of the Railroad Commission â¢ candidates to the railroad's hitching
post. Early in the- game Blackstock and I.aumeister were called to Mr. Herrin's
â¢ office and asked for a declaration of intention. I^aumeister . was so significantly
non-committal that there was no opposition to his candidacy, and Blackstock
was, from all accounts, simply a gift. Ever since. Mr. Blackstock quit .the dea
con business in the Presbyterian, church in Kern County and took to more prof
itable, politics and the law, he has had a hankering for political office. With
the assistance of Mr. Herrin he got it at the subsequent^ election.
Edson was already looked upon as the company's own, without, a struggle.
His freight bills ran up into the thousands of dollars each year, and the com
pany had had opportunity to extend him numerous courtesies, for which he

Herrir).
hart always been deeply grateful. Hervey Llndley, who succeeded Major Frank
Mclaughlin as miPinanaÃcr of Han Burns' light to break Into the United States
Senate, and "Jack" Wright, superintendent of the Sacramento division of the
railroad, were detailed <>n his ease, and the reports they sent in to Herrin were
rosy. Nevertheless Edson w;is called in to talk it oveY, and he said he was not
antagonistic to the railroad and would <lo t hÂ«- lair thins. At the present time Mr.
Herrin Js probably sorry he did not pin Edson down to some more substantial
statement.
"Whether or not the railroad spent money in his election Kdson says he does
not know, but that the company did offer to reimburse him for the several hun
dred dollars Bpent in his own behalf is a matter of fact and of record. The
result of the election was scarcely announced before Kdson received from "Wil
liam E. Qerber, cashier of the California State Hank at Sacramento, who was
one. of his political managers, a polite little note telling him in the most mat
ter of fact manner possible to Bend him a statement of the amount he was out
on the election and that it could be arranged with the company so that he
would lie reimhursi d. .he same courteous Intimation was held out to him by
Hervey Lindley, but Edson declined both proffers with becoming thanks, al
though he renewed his assurance of fair treatment.
Then, it is said. Mr. Herrin proceeded with the elaboration of his scheme of
control and operation. Laumeister was selected as the best man on the board to
take up the tight for the "people." Three or four years of virtue in public office
would put him in good shap. to run lor some local office where he could be of
use or to return to the commission if it should chance that he were needed.
Edson and Deacon Klackstock were lined up to stand the brunt of public dis
approval and to come out openly fn cases where the railroad needed votes. Mr.
Herrin did not consult Kdson on the proposition; he merely assumed that it
would go. He did not discover that in Edson, Lindley and Wright had passed
him a gold brick until the first of those secret meetings held at his residence.
That's where Mr. Hcirin first got oft wrong in his fra >tions. Theii came the
meeting at Herrin's house and the board came togethe" with Mr. Huntington's
lawyer to discuss Mr. Blackstock's second report writ! n by Herrin himself and
the resolution that was to relieve tne Southern Pacific of any possibility of be
ing mulcted for the costs in the grain rate cases.
Laumeister had already started his end of the game by declaring in differ
ent quarters' and with considerable nolso that it he should vote for .such a
measure as Blacks! h k's resolution he would be- ashamed to thereafter live in
the State. The plan was outlined to the member from Siskiyou and to the sur
prise of his confreres he flatly declined to stand for it. He said he was willing to
do the fair thing by ihe railroad, but no more, and he said il emphatically. Her
rin saw his well buiided plans tottering at the Bret blow, but he didn't give up.
Or. the contrary he .;et every piece of jtolitical machinery the railroad boasts of
to work to convince Edson that he was on the wrong tack, but when the sub
sequent meeting, of the board came off and the Itlackstock resolution came up
for action Edson stuck to it and voted aye only that he might be in a position to
move to reconsider il at a future meeting.
Laumeister at once quit talking and voted as he was told, and he joined
forces with Herrin in working on Edson. Every attempt was made to swing
him into line. Lindley and Wright gave up about everything else they had to
do and worked with Edson. They followed him from his cattle ranch at Ga
zelle to his room at the Occidental in San Francisco and offered him every in
ducement to get in with his friends. Lindley finally came to him openly and in
timated to him that if he would sign his own way bills and attend to his
own shipping ''things would be all right down below." "He told rru\" said Ed
son. when questioned on the point, "that T ought to get in where I would have
friends, and that if I would do my own billing I would find things made easy
for me down below." Like the election expenses, the free freight was also de
clined.
Finding their own influence not strong enough. Wright got his father-in
law, C. W. dark of Sacramento, to approach Edson while q>n a trip to this city.
Mr. Clark saw Edson again on the Stockton train while on his way to attend
a conference on the "Stockton differential." He besought him to stand in with
the company, as lie knew the resolution was a just- one. His son-in-law, he
said, had told him so. Mr. Edson, however, did not consider the son-in-law com
petent authority, and Mr. Clark's pleadings resulted in as little as did those of
the others. Still confident that Edson would come around. Herrin next lined up
some of the company's heaviest meat shippers who were doing business with
Edson. Tie selected Frank. M off at, the South San Francisco wholesaler, as the
heaviest representative, and Moffat hunted up his man on the evening of the
last meeting of the board. He urged every argument of policy and trade, and
after an hour's talk gave up the job in disgust. Herrin and Lindley are the
only ones left working.
"These fellows are after me all the time," said Edson. "I can't come to San
Francisco but* they come here to the hotel or stop me on the street and want
to make all sorts of propositions. I have no Quarrel with the railroad, "but I
won't give it any more than it deserves. I did not accept their offer to pay
my election expenses for the simple reason that I am able to pay my own ex
penses and have a disinclination to have any one attempt to buy me. I ignored
Llndley's freight proposition for the same reason. I'm friendly with the com
pany and will treat It squarely, but that's all I am bound to do."

SUPERVISORS TAKE ACTION
DANGER OF INFECTION FROM
RETURNING SOLDIERS.
Lepers Will Be Kept in Their Present
Uncomfortable Quarters for
Some Months at

Supervisors Aigeltlnger, Holland, Deasy
and Byington, accompanied by Health
Officer O'Erien and Colonel Sullivan, the
Mayor's private secretary, visited the
Pest'house yesterday for the purpose of
inspecting the new building that is be
ing constructed for the accommodation of
the lepers. The contractors having the
work in charge are rushing the work of
construction and promise to have the
building ready for occupancy within ten
days.
Health Officer O'Brien showed to the
Supervisors the necessity of having some
pUiee for the care and treatment of small
pox patients. He said that within the
past few days two cases of smallpox have
been discovered in this city, and that the
Health Department authorities had been
compelled to isolate the patients in priv
ate houses for the very good reason that
there is no place at the Pesthouse where
they can be cared for. He also pointed
out the fact that smallpox may be
brought to this city by the troops re
turning from Manila. Should this be the
case, it would be almost impossible for
the health authorities to prevent the
spread of the disease unless they are pro
vided with faciiites for the isolation and
treatment of patients brought from for
eign shores.
The force of these arguments was so
apparent that the Supervisors promised
for the present to allow the lepers to re
main in their present quarters in the old
building ajid to reserve the new build
ing for the reception of smallpox cases
until such a time as there is no longer
any danger, such as now exists by rea
son of the return of the troops from in
fected ports.
CLARK SENTENCED TO
LIFE IMPRISONMENT
MOTION FOE- A NEW TRIAL IS
DENIED BY THE COURT.
Judge Dunne and Counsel for the De
fense Exchange Compliments.
Other Convicts Sentenced.
Joseph Clark. the murderer of Fireman
Joseph P. Gross, was sentenced to im
prisonment for life in Folsom penitentiary
by Judge Dunne yesterday. Prior to the
passing of sentence a motion for a new
tilal was made on behalf of the defend
ant by his counsel. H. Digby Johnston.
It was denied. Associate Counsel Louis
P. Boaruman took an exception to the
denial and sentence was passed. Clark
was not moved and. the ordeal over, he
took his seat.
The murder for which Clark was sen
tenced to a living death occured in No
vember of last year. He accused his
victim of having betrayed his wife and
ruined his home, and deliberately sought
him out and killed him. These conten
tions entered into the defense, together
with a theory of self-defense, and the
doubt raised in the minds of the jury
thereby Bayed Clark's neck.
During the proceedings yesterday Judge
Dunne referred to the friction between
the court and Mr. Johnston during the
trial of the case. Jiidge Dunne said that
in his opinion any remarks that were
made by Mr. Johnston during the trial
were the result of zeal and not desire to
be contemptuous to the court. Mr. Board
man responded and all unpleasantness
was smoothed over and the matter was
declared closed.
John McDonald, convicted of an attempt
to commit burglary, was sentenced to
two years and six months imprisonment
at San Quentin. Warren Wilson, con
victed of grand larceny, was given a term
of ten years in Folsom.'

SUPERVISORS READY
TO BETRAY THE CITY
Will Submit to the Outrageous Demands
of the Railroad.
Market-Street Company's Franchises to Be
Passed to Print â The Betrayal
Vigorously Denounced.
The people of this city will witness
to-morrow a unique spectacle. They
â will see themselves betrayed, as they
have been many times before, and their
rights grossly violated by the Board of
Supervisors, but the outrage will be
perpetrated with a full knowledge of
its meaning and in the face of public
indignation. Supervisors have been
bribed before, but the people of the city
have generally learned of the commis
sion of the crime only after thp of
hecame local history. Municipal
offi( lala have been guilty of gross of
s, but the facts have become pub
public property only when the time for
rÂ«drcss had pass* d and <ondeninati>>n
was little more than an idle formality.
But to-morrow a majority of the
Fnarfl Â°f Supervisors intend to commit
an almost unparalleled outrage upon
the city, ;ind they know, with shame
ful knowledge, that the people of San
Francisco are perfectly aware of what
is to be done and why. The combina
tion which rules the Hoard of Super
visors intends to-morrow to indorse the
recommendation? of the Street Commit
tee in reference tÂ» the franchise? asked
by the Market Street Company and to
give to the corporation the enormously
valuable privileges which have been
demanded and which' should not be
granted. The Supervisors understand
thoroughly that their action will be a
betrayal of the city to the corrupt de
mands of the agents of C. P. Hunting
ton. The Supervisorial combination,
â which will close the deal to-morrow,
knows that the city will be robbed of
enormous revenues by seven official
votes, and that municipal authority will
lÂ«e given to indorse a public outrage.
Members of the clique are aware that
the Market Street Company, with the
votes of seven Supervisors, intends to
rh^at the city, rob the treasury of hun
dreds of thousands of dollars, defeat
the operation of the charter in some of
its most essential features and destroy
a competition that could not be other
wise than beneficial to San Francisco.
The Supervisors know these facts and
Fn do the public. Nevertheless a ma
jority of the Board of Supervisors in
tends to-morrow to give the Market
Street Company all it asks. The peo
ple of the city certainly have a right
to ask why.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors has already acted favor
ably upon the petition of the Market
Street Company for certain franchises
which, if granted, will remain for fifty
years as a stain upon the record of
public officers. The character and the
purpose of these franchises have al
ready been discussed. That they should
be granted seems an outrage- nothing
U ss than a crime, but the combination
in the Board of Supervisors has bowed
to the blandishments of Herrin and in
tends to pass the recommendations of
the Street Committee to print to-mor
row.
The majority members of the board
have assumed an attitude of desperate
unconcern. They know the iniquity of
the action which they will take to
morrow. They are perfectly aware that
th^ sentiment of decent citizens is
against them, but they are impervious
to the shafts of criticism and refuse
even to discuss their own prospective
action. They believe that their term
of official life, because of the charter,
will expire with the year and they are
determined to make the most of it.
So eager are they to obey the com
mands of the Market Street Company
that they are planning how to circum
vont any effort which may be made to
prevent The outrage that they intend
to inflict upon the city. They fear that
some member of the board who is not
a party to their plot, and who in de
cency to his constituents will vote
against the petitioned franchises, .will
change his vote and ask for a recon
sideration. If this is done the major
ity will simply decide to adjourn to an
other hour of the same day or to an.
early hour of the next day. This will
permit the schemers to carry their plan
into execution without delay, as timt
is now a vital factor to the Market
Street Company. No franchise may be
granted within six months of the end
of the present official term and the be
ginning of the charter regime. The
Market Street Company cannot afford,
therefore, to wait very long.
The majority members of the Board
of Supervisors have been correctly in
formed in reference to the policy of the
minority. When the unjust franchises
are passed to print a motion will be
made for a reconsideration, but it will
be made to the "next regular meeting"
and not to the "next meeting." If the
reference were made to the next meet
ing the majority could meet when it
pleased and complete its work. If the
reference be to the next regular meet
ing the champions of honesty in public
office will gain at least a week in which
to secure for their cause the pressure of
public opinion.
Only such an influence, it is expected. '
will have any weight. Representative j
citizens, aware of the outrage which is !
about to be perpetrated on the city, j
have already begun the campaign. They ;
have met in various parts of the city in '
mass meeting to condemn the outrage- !
ous demands of the Market Street Com- \
pany and to denounce the prospective i
action of the Supervisors. The city
knosvs what has been planned as a be
trayal of Its rights, and the peaple in- I
tend to give free expression to their '
opinions of the men who have been per- I
suaded, by whatever means they care !
to suggest, to sacrifice their own honor '
and the city's privileges. A meeting of
indignation was held last night by the i
Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs, and no pains were spared to in- j
form the derelict Supervisors that the .
motive of their policy is thoroughly un- j
derstood. Another meeting will be held
to-morrow night and committees will
wait personally upon the Supervisors to
ask them for an explanation of their
intended action. Everything possible j
will be done to avert the outrage and
the infliction of new indignities by a j
[corporation which has hitherto defied
! every effort to induce it to be decent.

Street Committee absolutely refused to
allow them to explain the vast Injury the
granting of these franchises would "work
' to the residents of the Mission district,
: particularly the much sought franchise
ay a double track railroad through
the Mission district to the southerly line
of the county, the members of the dif>
; ferent clubs assembled to vent their
t wrath on the members of the board who
i have arrayed themselves against the
' P<-"|>le.
The speakers handled thf> lash unmerci
. fuily. and every supervisor who voted in
; favor of granting the franchises was the
recipient or' a scorching denunciation.
j Several of the members of the federation
' went so far as openly to dÂ«-clar* tiK-ir
j willingness to present themselves at the
Hm-etii;;,' of the board to-morrow afternoon
armed with a cml of hemp. This rasl
I deola ration on the part of some of the
members brought forth round after round
of hearty applause. When the excitement
had reached its highest pitch Bernard
Joost arose and. with a tremor of pent-up
rage in his voice, said:
"Gentlemen, if the members of this fed
eration desire to lynch these shameless
: wretches the Jonst Hardware Company
I will furnish you the rope free- of charge
; and be delighted to do it.'
Mr. Joost's considerate offer brought P.
; Harrington, one of the prominent mem
| hers of the Potrero Improvement flub, to
his fft.-t. and that gentleman deliver
1 oration condemning both the Supervisors
and the Southern Pacific Company that
literally "burned with caustic criticisms.
[Mr. Harrington has beer, interested in the
! expansion and prosperity of the munici
pality for yean hack, and he is excep
i tionally well informed on all matters r>.-
--i lating to the graining of franchises. He
; went over the whole ground thoroughly,
| going back to the time when the Southern
I Pacific Com] i was granted by the State
; 120 acres of land at Third and Townsend
I streets, which it was supposed to use as
a terminal for its road. That was thirty
years ago. and at that time the railroad
company practically agreed to enter the
city alone the bay shore route and aban
j don the present route through the densely
populated Mission district.
"When the railroad company was given
these valuable lands." declared Mr. llar-
I rington. "they agreed to abandon the
pri sent methÂ« d of entering the city, but
they have never attempted to utilize the
franchise which they have on the bay
shore route. The Mission district is per
haps the most thickly settled portion of
otir city, and we are certainly entitled to
; at least a hearing before the Supervisors
on this matter. These trains which run
I through our streets, menacing the lives
of our families, have been operating long
enough. The people of the Mission dis
trict have always harbored a steadfast
opposition to the granting of a franchise
which would make it possible for th--
Southern Pacific to lay double tracks,
and they are opposed to it now more than
ever. These shameless Supervisors should
be tarred and feathered and then strug
I up. They have undertaken a thieving
lob that will be somewhat of a tax on
their nerves before they get it through.
The people are becoming tired of being
hoodwinked year after year by dishonest
Supervisors, and I think the time has
come when they are willing to use vioient
measures if necessary to preserve their

"The Southern Pacific people are trying
to freeze out the San Mateo line," con
tinued the speaker, "and if we stand by
! our guns they cannot do it. I was out to
! Oassidy's quarry the other day, and. on
looking over the ridge I saw a roadbed
â¢ ready for the rails. It was the Mission
; street road, sw.d it was built there by this
â  grasping monopoly simply to freoz-j oat

to build up this district out hero. There
is scarcely o foot at land from the buy
I shore to the Seal Rocks that does not lie

Crockers. And now they want to saddle
aonther burden upon the people out here,
and they exepect to do. it through the
medium of dishonest Supervisors. This
outrage calls fur a united opposition on
the part of the people of the Mission."
After Harrington finished he. was ac
! corded a rousing reception. T. V. Slevin,
: Gust Schnee, George Center, August Lil
i lie, W. J. Cuthbertson and Chairman Sta-
I der addressed the meeting and denounced
the proposed action of trie Supervisors.
T. B. Slevin, A. S. Lillie, W. J. Cuthbert
son, G. Schnee and C. Stader were dele
gated to visit the homes- of the Super
visors who have arrayed themselves with
the corporation and invite them to be
present to-morrow afternoon at Mangels
Hall, corner Twenty-fourth and Potrero
avenue, where another indignation meet
ing will be held. In inviting the Super
; visors the committee have been instructed
to state to them that the reason they
have been specially requested to attend â 
is to give them an opportunity to ac
knowledge the influence which induces
them to betray tue people. It is not ex
pected that the members of the commit
tee will find many of -the Supervisors at
home when they call this morning. The
following resolution was unanimously
adopted:
Whereas, The Southern Pacific Company
is anxious to lay a double track railroad
from Third and Townsend streets through
the Mission districts to the southerly line
of the county of San Francisco, and the
petition of said Southern Pacific has been
favorably reported by the Street Committee
of the Board of Supervisors; and
Whereas, The residents of the Mission dis
tricts of the city and count) of San Fran
| cisco realize that the present route of said
railroad has been mainly instrumental in
' causing a depreciation in property values,
I and the passage to and fro of trains, with
the smoke, whistles and noise, have caused
I an insufferable nuisance to the adjoining
property owners, shaking the foundations
of their homes and compelling their sick
to be removed from the sounds of the un
j earthly shrieks of the engine whistle and
the rattling of the wheels. over the rail*.
' which also cause general discomfort: and
Whereas, It is the general belief that a
double track will result in the doubling of
the dancers, abuses, annoyances, and will
further depreciate our interests; and
Whereas. The Increased speed with which
the Southern Pacific proposes to operate Its
trains will greatly increase the danger to
life and property; and
Whereas, The said Southern Pacific Com
pany was given permission by a franchise
granted In IS7I to operate a railroad upon
the east bay shore of San Francisco, which
It has failed to do; and
Whereas. The permission asked by the
Southern Pacific Company to lay a double
track- is simply a subterfuge under which
1 the said company is seeking a franchise
which it is our belief they do not possess,
it having been ascertained that the said
railroad company was never granted the
privilege of operating its trains across the
sidewalks of public streets in the Mission
district; therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Federation of Mission
Improvement Clubs, representing one-third
of the area of San Francisco and 33 per cent
of the residents, do hereby earnestly protest
aca.lnst the granting of a franchise or per
missiivi to the said Southern Pacific Com
pany to lay a double track railroad through
and in the midst of the thickly settled por
tion of the city to our great annoyance and
to the danger of our lives and to the detri
ment and Injury of our property.
Resolved, further. That the Federation of
; Mission Improvement Clubs hereby urge the
Hoard of. Supervisors to order the Southern
Pacific Company to remove their rails from
j the present route of said railroad and oper
! ate the same upon the bay shore according
| to oft-repeated promises to the people of
the Mission.
Resolved, further. That the attention of
the Board of Supervisors be called to the
present violation of a city ordinance by the
Southern Pacific Company In operating its
trains over the sidewalks of public streets
therein, and we urge the removal of said -
tracks and the cessation of said offense.
Resolved.- further. That a committee of ten
be appointed to wait on the Board of Super
visors on Monday afternoon. May 29, 1899,
to present these resolutions and urge that
the petition of the Southern Pacific Com
pany be promptly refused.
Resolved, further. That a copy of these
I resolutions be furnished each of the daily
; . papers.
In' compliance -.with the provisions of
| the resolution a committee of ten was ap
| pointed to wait upon the Mayor and
! Boacd .of Supervisors at their meeting
Monday and urge the rejection of the
! Southern Pacific Company petition. It
I was unanimously decided to forward the
. following petition to the board, as draft- ;
j ed and presented by Gust Schnee:
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors-
Gentlemen: The Federation of the Mission
Improvement Clubs, representing twelve im
provement clubs in the city and county of San '
Francisco, and who own fully one-third of the i
. property- in the city and county, respectfully
requests . your honorable body to defer action
on the matter of granting franchises to the
Southern Pacific Company and to re-refer the !
entire, matter to the Street Committee of your
j board so that the people of the Mission, who j
I are the most interested parties to the transac
tion, and whom the Federation represents, may
have an opportunity to appear before your !
board and explain In detail the vast injury the
granting of these franchises would work.

College, Columbia, S. C. University of Kansas City. Kans., and of Rich

rived at that conclusion after a residence
in Chicago and a two days' stay in this
city, and imparted his knowledge on the
subject of his Satanic Majesty to the
American Baptist Publication Society
at its morning session yesterday.
The reverend gentleman too.k occasion
to bring out this information in the course
of his able address on "Financial and
Theological Correlations." Besides ad
vancing his theory and conclusion Mr.
Henson said;
I don't tliink it is a Bin to be rich, but I do
thtnk it is a sin for a man not to be rich if he
has had an opportunity. I' don't believe that
Lazarus went to heaven because he was poor,
but because he was pious. We Baptists have a
great many rich men with us, and I wish we
had more, because we have greater opportuni
ties to use money than ever before.
We have been crying for "open door," open
ports and the razing of walls which closed us
out. The Lord has seen tit to open the doors,
the ports and let us press through the breach
in the walls and press and rush over the iand
as Joshuas men did when the walls of Jericho
fell. I don't know much about the flag being
flown wherever it ii flung out, but where the
banner of Christ is flung out there, it should
stay forever.
Everything is hopeful now. The farmers are
paying their mortgages and getting good prices.
Financial affairs have taken a new heart, but.
what is the matter with our missionary treas
ury? I'll tell you. There is no system, and
that iÂ« what we must have.
And oh, these moderns with their "advanced"
ideas and easy methods of disposing of all
vital questions! Hear them say:
"Man is not so much a sinner as he is unfor
tunate. Let him alone. It Is heredity. He is
going throueh an evolution. He does not de
serve a hell, hut a hospital. Give a man a
chance to save himself, to work his p.issuge to
heaven.- If it's anywhere it Is here. As for
hell! Hell is nowhere."
But for all that there is a hell and a devil.
I know it. I have lived in Chicago. Yes, and
I have met him here in San Francisco during
my brief sojourn.
The important business feature of the
morning was the report of the commission
on "Systematic Beneficence," whi< h was
laid before the convention by Rev. Dr. T.
J. Morgan, the acting secretary.
The report showed that the ?um of
$319 25 had been received during the year,
and $315 94 had been expended for carry-,
ing on the work of the commission. Thf
object of the commission is to introduce
into the churches an orderly plan of giv
ing. The commission was first organized
May 23, 1899, to continue three years. As
the" work has been only partially organ
ized, the commission asked that it be
given authority to continue for three
J < .irs DQOI c.
Following the reading of the report,
there was a brief discussion, participated
in by Rev. Mr. Quick of Massachusetts.
Rev. Dr. Morehouse of New York and
others. Dr. Morehouse offered the follow
ing 1 motion, which was adopted:
"That It is the sense of those present
r< pr< senting the societies and the
churches that it is desirable that the com
mission on systematic beneficence be con
tinued for three years mure in accordance
with the recommendations of the commis
sion, its work to be along the same lines
and such other lines as experience may
suggest. Further, that this recommenda
tion be reported to the various branches
and boards of the church."
The closing address of the session was
by Rev. Dr. E. R. Chivera, president of
the Baptist Young People's Union. His
subject was "An Enlarged and System
atic Beneficence." â¢ Mr. Chivers said in
part: ' .
â â¢ Christian Riving is at once a duty and a

Local Sluggers Made to Paw the Air
When Hits Would Have Evened
the Score or Won the
Game.
The Santa Cruz aggregation of baseball
. talent invaded this municipality ster
â ay and crowded the local representatives
â¢*m ut of first position in the league race- by
a combination of timely swats nd bat
tery errors on the part of Fireman Fitz
and his first assists I Swindells. It was
not an interesting same, for both teams
played overcautiouslyi making it drag
with the exception of two or three
patches where baseball of the sensational
order was put Up.
Both teams had in their *tar twirlers
and as in the game at Santa Cruz Fitz
suffered by comparison. He was inclined
to >*o up In th air at critical stages, and
some of his passes proved costly. Tie was
touched up for ten hits, with a total of
fourteen base?; which proves that Hank
Han does not control the only bunch of
sluggers in the league!
Donlin was â¢ particularly effective in a
close pinch, as shown by the fact that
twice the locals had the bases full, but
were unable to score, and at another time
âin the fourth inningâ the first four men
up reached first on three singles and a
base on balls, yet only one tally was re
corded. That is baseball. In the second
inning Donlin retired the side on strikes
with the bases full and not a run was
Krugr's work yesterday demonstrated j
to the satisfaction of all that his rightful .
position is in the outfield. He covers no
pround to speak of at short and his bun
gles invariably occur at the most inop
portune periods.
Santa Cruz had a new man. Dronnan, in
ripht field. He formerly played with
Seattle and has a good record.
The star play of the day was made by
Riley in the second Innin when he ran
up ilnst the fence hack of third base ;
f and pulled down a high foul from Don
lin's hat. Santa Cruz cut out three dou
ble plays, all of which were pretty and
with Clark participating In them all. The

GOOD FLY FISHING
IS NOW IN ORDER
Large Catches of Trout Have Been
Made Near Point Reyes â Re
ports from the Rivers.
According to latest reports from the
mountains the McCl >ud River is getting
:id condition for fly fishing.
I Ki-liehor has been enjoying good
sport tor some weeks past and the local
anglers who whipped the stream recently
ed with nice atches of fish. The
Truckee River is also looking well, but it
in a little too early yet for fly fishing on
this popular stream. The report.* that
fish were being killed Indiscriminately by
poachers on the Truckee does not apply
to that part of the river between Boca
and Truckee. The reports state that the
_. w;ts done below Verdi and that
â¢ wing to the obstructions which still re
main in the riverâ that is, on the Nevada
ihe fish cannot ascend the stream,
but i ongregate in large numbers under
lams, where the indlans can capture
th< m easily.
The Fish Commissioners of this State
have done all within their power to have
the obstructions in ihe Truckee removed,
but II seems that the authorities of Ne
vada State have not extended to the gen
en who are working In the interest of
.! cause any assistance.
Fish Commissioner Vogelsang has tried
every means to remedy the existing evil.
so to speak, but he finds that without
issistance from ihe other side of the
line his efforts will prove unavailing.
The near-by streams are panning out

Two striped bass were caught In the

gl^rs have not as yet prospected for large

but it goes without saying that the fishes
are there and can bo caught by those who
will go prepared for their capture.
Two Deputy Fish Commissioners have
been taking small black bass from the
shallow pools of Russian River and plac
ing them in deep water. It is said tnat
are thousands of bass fry land
locked in water whicn will dry quickly in
warm weather and to san-e the little fel
lows the deputies are. now engaged in the
good work of bass fry protection.
Large striped bass are also said to be
enjoying quiet repose in the deep pools
at the mouth of the Russian River. Some
of the expert anglers should give them
a trial.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 28, 1899.
HIGH SCHOOL
GIRLS RICK IT
A DECISION
Basket-Bail Game Ends
in a Storm.
Nine High School girls, filled with an
overflowing wrath, are now nursing an
Indignation of spirit which knows no
bounds. Collectively they are known a?
the Girls High School basket 15811 team,
and as such they have a grievance which
is spending itself in subdued excoriations
against the lady players of the Young
Men's Christian Association.
An athletic combat, a trinity of ref
erees and an error in the keeping of time
are the counts in the complaint which the-
High School players have filed against
the Christian athletes. There was a
game between these two teams yester
day, and th Y. M. C. A. won out by a
score of 7 to 5. This is the second defeat
The F^ecalcitraQt Basket - Ball
Players.
whi^h the High School nine has suffered
at the hands of the Christians, and it ran
kles deep in the maiden heart* of the stu
dents. While the High School young la
dies acknowledge defeat according to the
reading of the score, they claim that it
was not such de facto. With a unanimous
voice they raise their wailing complaints
to the skies above and invoke justice to
punish the referees who cut short the
second half of the game by five minutes,
thereby destroying their chancs for win
ning the game.
The game was played in the gymnasium
of the Young Men's Christian Association
building. The referees selected were
F. R. Shaw. J. A. Heuer and Dr. H. L.
Dietz, all good members of the associa
tion and keen judges of basket ball tech
nique. With tears glistening in her eyes
one High School player said that this was
the first ill omen of a most unfortunate
(lay. "How could we win with all three
against us" she said. " 'Twould be im
possible." Dr. Dietz explains it differ
ently. His version is that the visiting
team bad the right to nominate two of
the officials, which they failed to do, and
in order to play the game he was forced
to find the two who judged the contest.
The first half was smooth sailing., with
hardly a ripple of contention against the
decisions of the officials. Not so at the
end, of the second half. Then the merry
war of nine singing muses on one side
and three bad men on the other began a
short-lived career. The chief referee blew
his whistle for the end of the game. The
score was 7 to 5, with the Y. M. C. A. on
the long end.
An explosion then occurred which shook
the rafters out of joint. The nine High
School athletes surrounded the three offi
cials and midst shrieks and shouts de
clared they had been euchred out of rive
minutes of play. Whirlwinds of femin
ine passion floated through the gymna
sium and the three officials capitulated.
They allowed an extra live minutes of
play, at the end of which the score stood
the same. The additional time did not sat
isfy the High School athletes, however,
and they are still bristling with what
they term a righteous Indignation and a
just wrath. It will be some days before
the emotional storm subsides.

Peel. It Is decidedly strong in batting,
and by no means weak in bowling. The
captains of the teams will be chosen on
the grounds.
No matrh is set down on the schedule
for Decoration day. In previous seasons
a city team has usually visited Placer
County at this time, but the citrus col
ony has been so much thinned out that
cricket in that region is practically dead.
At the last meeting of the California
Cricket Association the rule previously
adopted by the association for calculat
ing the percentages of the clubs in
matches for the Brown pennant for 1899
was annulled and the following rule
adopted: Count one point for each vic
tory, half a point for each drawn game,
and divide the total number of points by
the number of games played.
The first cricket match of the season in
Lake County was played at Burns Valley
between the Lakeport and Burns Valley
clubs The latter team consisted of T.
W. Beakbane. W. T. Bayton, E. E. Gray,
,H. P. H. Haggitt, W z H. Turner. Q. R,
Webber, W. Spaulding. J. Palmer. J.
Purves. J. Davis and C. Noel. In their
first innings they, scored 35 runs. For
Lakeport Captain H. V. Keeling- played a
fine innings, scoring 72 runs before he was
caught by Beakbane off Gray. The inn-
Ings closed for 133.
In their second innings Burns Valley put
together only 2S runs. Lakeport accord
ingly won by an. innings and 70 runs.

The principal event in gun club affairs
is the annual Inanimate Target Associa
tion meeting, which will be held at An
tioch on Monday and Tuesday. Clubs
representing- different counties of the
State will be present to engage in the

SAUSALITO ARE
FINALLY RAIDED
Sheriff Taylor Takes
a Hand.
The expected raid on the Sausalito pool
rooms was reserved for Brooklyn handi
cap day. The big turf event in the East
attracted an unusually large number of
players to the hillside town over the bay
yesterday, and both the rooms of Hum
phrey & Co. and Harvey & Co. were
thronged with people. Three or four of
the race? at Brooklyn track had been
debided, with the usual telegraphic de
scription given by the caller at Harvey
AL- Co. 'a room in the Buffalo Exchange,
when Sheriff Taylor of Marin County,
and a force of deputies, headed by Amos
Lunt, appeared on the scene. Four play
ers, giving thcrr names as T. Brun, E.
Follansbee, John Daniels and E. A. Clark,
were placed under arrest, together with
the entire "crew" of Harvey & Co. The
names furnished of the employes, were:
Morris Rosendom. Max Cohn, J. K. Wil
lis. W. Martin. Harry Hart, B. T. Reilly,
H. Gorman. John H. Knilly James Smith,
L. A. Meyers, E. Bert, J. Connolly and R.
Curt. Joe Harvey, one of the proprietors
of the place, was also arrested.
Very little excitement was caused by
the raid, the players apparently being not
in the least disconcerted, proceeding to
speculate on the different runs as if noth
ing had occurred. The Brooklyn. St.
Louis and Lakeside track.- were- listed, and
though the Sheriff and his men put in
their appearance at l o'clock wagers were
accepted and winning tickets cashed until
shortly after 3:30 o'clock, when the guar
dians "of the law. acting under instruc
tions from Prosecuting Attorney Mclsaac,
ordered the room closed. Three races
were still to be decided at St. Louis and
two at Lakeside track. The closing was
abrupt, and notice was given that "all
bets stood." The Sheriff then gathered
up evidence in the way of sheets, tickets,
etc. and the men under arrest were es
corted to the depot by the deputies in
time to catch the 4 o'clock train for San
Rafael.
The room conducted by John Hum
phrey and Henry Schwartz was unmo
lested for the time being, Joe Harvey hav
ing undoubtedly agreed to make a test
i ase of it. In the complaint Harvey is
charged with willfully and unlawfully
opening, carrying on and conducting a
banking game, played for money, with a
device commonly known as bookmaking.
The rooms at Sausallto are operating tin
der a license granted by the Town Trus
tees. Thf proprietors of the rooms d<Miy
the accusation that they are conducting
a banking game, and contend that if they
ar>- convicted, l.o..kmaking within the
confines of any track in California is il
and th<y will protest against it.
When the men arrived at San Rafael
they were taken at once before Justice
of the Peace George Rodden. The names
Of the men had in the meantime been in
serted in the John Doe warrants. Court
was held In a public hall, the Justice's
< 1 1 1 iâ¢ i being too small to accommodate the
throng. A. Sylva appeared on behalf of
the men. All admitted thp act charged
against them, hut denied that it was an
offi i .-â¢ under the la w.
District Attorney Hugh Mcfeaac Of Ma
rin County appeared as prosecutor and
was assisted by Attorney Daniel Ryan of
this city. Argument on the demurrers en
tered in behalf of the men will he heard
in San Rafael next Saturday. The ac
cused were all released on $mo. This was
furnished by Mr. Harvey, who sat at the
table with "justice Rodden and saw the
letter's pile of gold increase gradually,
until all had been provided for.
Trustee Sylva said that if the Trustees
of Sausalito were granting licenses con
trary to law they were liable to arrest.
He stated it as his intention to have him
self arrested and charged with felony.
He would then sue out a writ of habeas
corpus and take the matter direct to the
Supreme Court. This would determine the
status of the^ase against the bookmak
ers at once.
"Jim" Neal gave the name of James
Smith. Attorney Ryan, knowing his iden
tity, said. "You' don't look like a Smith."
Neal stuck to the name tenaciously.
The bookmakers returned to the city
on the 8 o'clock boat.
THE BIG PUGILISTS
AND THEIR CHANCES
Knowing Ones Contend That Fitz
simmons Is Still Dangerous
for Six Rounds.
It is said that interest in the coming:
hig fight in New York between Jeffries
and Fitzsimmons is hemming very keen
in the East and that the Californian is
gaining admirers daily.
It matters not who the pugilists are,
whenever a fight is announced there will
be found admirers of both men, even
though one of the sloggers may he so far
superior as a boxer to his prospective op
ponent that comparison would seem ridic
ulous. Now, then, all persons who have
seen Fitzsimmons' and Jeffries' perform
ances must admit that Fitzsimmons is
Jeffries' master In all particulars that per
tain t" boxing. Fitz is a better general,
is swifter on his feet, can' use both hands
to good advantage and can certainly de
liver the hardest blow, because of the fact
that he has thoroughly mastered the
game and knows when to hit and how to
Jeffries in his fight with Sharkey. which
\v a s the. only contest from which a good
line can be taken of his ability as a
pugilist, satisfied his most ardent admir
. is that he had much to learn of the art
of self-defense. The right he used only
on .i few occasions and the blow was tel
egraphed so plainly that the sailor was
away from danger when the shot was
fired".
Jeffries' left hand swings, or crooks, as
they arc- termed by the followers nf the
ring, carried dange-r with them each time
that Sharkey's head trot within tiring dis
tance, ;>r<] although they came tolerably
swift at tim^s Sharkey generally avoided
the full force of the blow by ducking un
der the glove or side-sfeppnÃ his oppo
nent. The fact of the matte 1 - was that the
sailor kept a close watch on Jeffries"
movements, and the big fellow when set
tling himself for a lead or a swing . x
posed what was coming by falling into
an awkward position, thus giving Shar
key a chance to get away from trouble.
Time and again Jeffries forced his oppo
nent into some corner of the ring and
acted like a big amateur who did not
know what to do when an opportunity
had offered to administer solid punish
ment to his adversary at close range.
Possibly Jeffries has changed his style of
fighting completely since then, but the
fai t remains nevertheless that his left
swings were not only awkwardly deliv
ered, but the manner in which he held
his hand (sldewise) when about to lead
was sufficient to satisfy experts of the
game that it would be only a question of
time when the member must fall by his
side helpless. Subsequently, when he
fought Parson Da vies' nigger in Now
York, he maimed the left hand by strik
ing his opponent .1 swinging blow on the
bead. Of course, there is always room for
improvement, and it is to be presumed
that Jeffries is a far better man to-day
scientifically than he >vas on the night he
fought the sailor in Mechanics' Pavilion.
Most people who have a predilection
for flstlc sports admit that Fitzsimmons
is far superior to Jeffries in many ways;
that is, he is a better judge of distance,
knows to the second when to strike, how
to stop, how to duck and how to draw
his opponent to him by fiddling and other
ways until he has his quarry within easy
hitting distance. In generalship Fhzsim
mons. has no superior. After summing
up all these important facts the only
question relative to the coming fight that
is open to discussion is in regard to the
effect which years have had on the cham
pion. Many contend that he is too old
to go a hard pace and that if Jeffries ran
land one or two good stiff blows in the
early part of the game Fitz will wilter
and go to pieces. Age undoubtedly cuts
quite a figure In the fighting game and
when it is considered that there is about
sixteen years' difference between the men
and also a difference of about forty
pounds in their weight one would natur
ally be inclined to wonder what possible
chance of success has Fitzsimmons
against the strapping and hair-covered
lad from Southern California.
But on thought, if the fact that a tap
r.n thÂ° .law point properly put must be
considered as meaning defeat to the re
ceiver, which of the two men, allowing for j
the handicap in size and age, would be
most liable to get "the auctioneer?"
Doubtless eight out of ten people would
say "Jeff" will be first to receive.
Age. then, will not count for much in
a short engagement unless a man Is so
tar gone, physically that he is unable to
hit or guard himself from attack. If
Fitzsimmons is anything near as good
a man to-day as he was when he met the
clever Jim Corbett in Carson City he
should certainly defeat Jeffries in five or
six rounds or possibly sooner. Allowing j
that a few ye.ars have lessened his vitality
it is feasible that he can yet journey
through five spirited rounds. All of Fitz
simmons' battles were of short duration
excepting those between Maher. Corbett |
and Dempsey. It can therefore be seen
that Jeffries must cut out a warm pace
from the start and smother Fitzsimmons
quickly if he hopes to win. It is said on
good authority that Fitzsimmons is doing
remarkable work in his training and if
this be a fact the outlook for Jeffries is
bad unless the big feilow is a very much
Improved man.
Late accounts which camp over the â 
wire stated that the men had not be^n
training properly. Of course, in the event
of a prearranged affair comment would
be useless.
WILL SPREAD WHITE
WINGS TO THE WIND
Corinthians and Californias Prepare
to Hold Annual Class Flag Re
gattas ever the Usual
Courees.
The Corinthians will hold their annual
regatta on Tuesday. May â ). The entries
in the five classes into which the yarhts
are divided were given in Fridays Call.
Clara 1. the 36-footers, and the 30-foot
<Mmhs will sail over the "long course,"
yachts of the 25-foot class will take the
"middle course." and the 20-footers will
go over the "short course. " The yachts
in all classes will be started by the firing |
of a single gun, and will be timed from !
the signal, no^ time being allowed for I
rossing the line. If no yacht crosses the I
finishing line within live hours from the
time of starting, the race will be sailed
again. Yachts will receive time allow
ances based on their sailing length, and
calculated by the tables in the club book i
Of 1887. The prizes will be 1899 flags, one
for first and another for second place in
each class; but no prize will be awarded
Unless at least two yachts compete in a
class. All yachts must secur* numbers
before the race. These can be obtained j
at the clubhOTJÂ»Â« on or after to-day, and \
must be returned after the regatta. The j
crews must be composed of amateurs, and
helmsmen must be members of the Corin
thian Yacht Club. H. H. Gorter is the
measurer, and the members of the re
gatta committee are T. J. Kavanaugh,
Douglas Erskine and P. J. fttartensteln.
The sixth annual class-flag regatta of
the California Yacht Club will also be
held on Decoration day. The course be
gins at the southerly pierhead of the
Narrow-gauge Mole, and is officially reck
oned at ten nautical miles. Yachts will
be divided into four classes, the first
class consisting of yachts of 25 feet sail
ing length or less; the second of yachts
exceeding 25 feet and not exceeding 30
feet; the third of yachts exceeding ,10 feet
and not exceeding 40 feet; and the fourth
comprising all craft having a greater sail
ing length than 40 feet. Time allowances
and measurements will be made accord
ing to the rules of the Pacific Interrfub
Yacht Association, published in 1898. The
start will be made at the firing of a sin
gle gun for each class, and no allowance
will be made for crossing the line. The
time within which the course must be
completed to entitle a yacht to a prize is
four hours. The winning boat in each
class will receive a pennant. No profes
sionals may be employed in the crews, ]
and helmsmen must be members of the
California Yacht Club. The yachts will
carry the racing numbers assigned to I
them by the Pacific Interclub Yacht As- j
sociation on the luff of the mainsail, not ;
less than four feet above the boom and
on the starboard side. The numbers were I
given out yesterday at the clubhouse, and !
must be returned after the race to the i
committee. As Blossom Rock buoy, the \
first mark in the course, is also one of I
the marks of the Corinthian course. Call- j
fornia yachts arc instructed to yield the â 
right of way to the Corinthian boats, |
which will have to take in their light
sails and gybe round the buoy. Time lost I
by so doing will be allowed on application 'â 
to the regatta committee within twenty
four hours after the race. The regatta
committee consists of B. W. Bobson,
George turn Sude.n and R. R. l'Homme

WE WILL HAVE

IMPRESARIO
Patrizi Will Import
Musical Talent.
TO REPRESENT MOROSCO
LATEST EFFORTS OF GREAT
COMPOSERS FOR US.
Italy and California to Be Brought
Into Closer Business Relations
by an Exchange of
Products.
Ettore Patrizi, co-editor and proprietor
of I' ltalia, leaves to-morrow for New
York, en route to Italy. His trip is un
dertaken in behalf of art and home prod
ucts, and while abroad he will represent
Manager Morosoo in the ait proposition
and Hugh Craig, ex-president of the
Chamber of Commerce; E. Scott, secre
tary of the Chamber of Commerce, and A.
Bbarbaro, president of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association, in the interest
of home products and manufactures.
Mr. Patrizi's mission Is to brintc Italy
and California into closer business rela
tions, and with this end in view he will
Introduce to his oountrymen sugar of
homo manufacture, hides, tallow, cereals,
seeds and canned fruits. Ilr- will also
satisfy Milan's curiosity as to the Sabin
telephone system in vogue in this State
and said to be the most perfect in prac
tical use.
From Italy Mr. Patrizi will arrange for
the direct Importation of silk, common
glass bottles and asbestos. Heretofore all
the Italian silk that has reached the Cali
fornia market has come by way of
France, a process of migration that neat
ly increases the price of the article before
it finally reaches this coast. Glass bottles
are at present being imported from Ant
werp, and Mr. Patrizi claims that Italian
bottles may be secured at much lower
rates. As to the asbestos, Italy has the
greatest asbestos mini in the world and
is extensively using the product In the
manufacture of window shades, electric
wins, etc.
Mr. Patrizi's Impresario venture is one
that promises to bring Joy to all musical
lovers. Negotiations are to be entered
Into at once with Mascagni, Leoncovallo,
Puccini and Umberto Giordane for the
production here at liorosco's Grand
Opera-hous( of their latest compositions.
Patrizi will bring the artists from Italy
and also me orchestra leader, but the
chorus and orchestra will be made tip en
tirely fpim home talent. It Is proposed
to produce Mascagnl's "l'Amico Fritz,"
"Rantzau" and his very latest Japanese
Â«.]' ra, "Iris," none of which productions
lias ever been heard here.
"Mr. Patrizi hopes to make the feature
of his repertoire the oratorios of Antonio
Perosi, the young Italian priest.
UoroBCO and Patrizi hope to open their
season of grand opera early in the new
year. Although their plans are neces
sarily as yet immature, this much, has
been decidedâ the productions are to be
the latest, the artists the best and the
prices moderate.

BULLETS FLEW
ON THE VALLEJO
STREET WHARF
Charles Murray Was
Attacked.
OUTCOME OF THE STRIKE
IT IS BELIEVED THAT ONE MAN
WAS INJURED.
Murray Was Taking a Non-Union
Sailor to a Ship When a Gang of
Jack Tars Opened Fire With.
Guns and Stones.
The trouble which has been brewing for
months between the Coast Seamen's Un
ion and the Shippers' Association culmi
nated !ast night in a pitched battle on
Vallejo street wharf. Although from fif
teen to twenty shots were fired no one
was injured so far as can be definitely
ascertained, although it is rumored that
one of the- sailors was struck by a bullet
lired by Deputy Shipping Master Charles
Murray. The story of the battle as told
by Mr. Murray is as follows:
"The Shipowners' Association has had
trouble with the union sailors for a long
time. Whenever we try to put a non
union man aboard a vessel a .u-ang of un
ion patrolmen will pounce upon us and
attempt to take him away. Yesterday
afternoon 1 secured the services of Louis
Fein, better known along the froht as
'Frenchy.' who signed for a vessel lying
at Eureka. I arranged with him to take
him down to Vallejo street wharf at 9
o'clock and put him aboard the steamer
Kureka which would sail for that port.
"Fein met me shortly after 8 o'clock
and 1 took him in my buggy along with
my assistant. A. Anderson, and we drove
down to tlie dock. We arrived too early,
and fearing trouble I did not leave him
on the wharf, but drove around a couple
of blocks. When we again approached
the wharf I noticed a number of sailor
patrolmen lurking around in the shadows
under the coal bunkers. I jumped out
and told Fein to drive down the wharf,
saying 1 would walk ahead and sec if the
coast was clear. I had proceeded but a
few steps, when the buggy was greeted
with a shower of stones, one of which
struck Anderson on the thigh. A tall
sailor who had been making trouble
around our office all afternoon then
stepped out from behind Thomas Crow
ley .s boathouse. 1 said. "What are you
going to do." and he replied, 'You know
what I'm going to do you !'
"He then 'hew a revolver and lired di
rectly at me. This .-eemed to t..- a gen
eral signal and we were at once greeted
with a fusillade of bullets from all quar
ters. I .drew my revolver and tired four
shots. I don'l know whether 1 hit any
one or not. but I nope 1 did."
According to the statement of other wit
nesses, who corroborate Murray's story
in every detail, the sailors emptied their
guns and then tied unceremoniously.
Their number is given all the way from
eight to twenty. Sergeant Brophy and
Officer McGowan were early on the scene,
but were powerless to do anything. Mur
ray surrendered himself to the police ."id
accompanied Sergeant Brophy on a round
of the water front resorts. Doping to locate
some of his assailants He says he knows
three of the men well by sight, but does
not know their names.
Louis Fein, the pal, or. was taken down
to the end of the wharf and placed under
a strong guard. His story is the same in
detail as that told by Murray and he
supplements it with the remark, "Yes, I

Home Rupture Cure
Â§
Marvelous Blessing to Those Who
Are Ruptured. \
Cures Reported That Almost Defy
Beliefâ Thrilling Words From
Thos3 Who Recover.
Dr. W. S. Rice of 418 S. Main St., Adams. X. V. ,
has the distinction of perfectly curing even the
most difficult ruptures of long standing. He
does this without causing the patient one bit
MR. N. E. SMITH.
of pain, absolutely without danger, and also
I without the loss of a moment's time from the
daily occupation. He uses no knife and sends
: his method and treatment direct to the suf-
I ferer's home where it can be easily used with-
out assistance ' and brings immediate comfort
I and relief. ' . .
It requires from three to ten weeks for the
j ruptured opening to heal, at the end of which
time the patient can pitch hay. lift. a barrel of
flour, plow. In the fields, or do any kind of
hard work without any danger of the rupture
coming back. Dr. Rice has. cured hundreds of
old men who had been ruptured 30- and 40
â¢ years. ';, y â¢ / ' Â° Â»-â ,->.,.. ,'i â¢.':*â¢/
They write him letters that a few years ago
could not have been possible since never before
has there been a certain cure for rupture. N. E.
Smith . of . Mound City, Kans.,"ls one of the
men- whom Dr. â¢ Rice has restored to perfect
health. Mr. Smith -says: "Although pretty
well along in years and with an old rupture
that might have ended, my days at any time,
! I am Just as glad to "be cured as though. I had
j my life to live over agffln. I was a little, bit
! doubtful about Dr. Rice's claims. ' I have seen
I so many failures ;of â  trusses and â¢ treatments
i that, while the plan looked wonderful, I had
my doubts. ; He cured me all right and I am-
willing to believe that he will any one, I don't
care how bad off they are." It .will-pay any
ruptured man or woman or. the parents of a
ruptured child to write, to. Dr. Rice for a copy
of his book, which he sends free to all. And
If you know â¢ of . any one else who is ruptured
tell Dr.. Rice to also send a book to him. Do
this at once. Don't delay in a matter of such
Importance. Investigate this; marvelous meth-
od that '- Is guaranteed to cure rupture. â  . , * â â :â¢

Some of the eye-witnesses claim that the
tall sailor who seemed to be the ring
leader, was struck, but managed to stag
ger away from the scene at a good pace.
He is probably hidden in one of the board

STRONG AND FAST HARES.
Dogs That Were Completely Pumped
at Yesterday's Meeting â Four

The hares at Union Park yesterday ran
very strongly and completely pumped
many of the dogs. The course between
Hurricane and Battleship was the longest
of the day, lasting 3 minutes 19 seconds.
According to an established rule, after a
brace of dogs contesting In the open stake
runs for three minutes one or more relief

liberated yesterday got in at the kill but
too late to enjoy the running. Winning

This act also abolished minim: districts

Ing of mining claims in precisely the same con
dition in which it was prior to the passe of
tne act of 189,, en far as the statute boo* are
concerned, excepting ns to the duty of the County
Recorder, as will i... hereinafter noted In thÂ«
Bbuenee'of any State law governing the loca
non and recording of mining claims the laws
of Congress and the local rulea and customs
control with reference thereto.
Hon. Curtis U. Llndley, in his valuable work I
on mines, has concisely stated the Federal law i
upon the subject of mining locations and the
recording "'' the same, from which may be
gathered the following provisions with refer
ence thereto:
Location of lode or quartz claims â
The nets necessary to be performed to
constitute a valid lode location under
the Federal law are (1) the discov
ery, (2) the marking of th. location on the
ground so . that Its boundaries can be readily
traced. No nqtlee need be posted or recorded:
no particular kind of ... quired so
long as the boundaries can be readily traced.
Such a discovery having been made as will
satisfy the law, the marking of the location on
the ground including the place of discovery
completes the location and clothes the locator
with the complete possessory title. No labor
need be performed until within the year com
mencing on the Ist day of January succeeding
the date of location
Location of placer claimsâ By the Federal
laws a placer claim is located by marking the
boundaries so that they can t,.- readily traced.
As we said in regard to lode claims, no notice
need be posted, no particular kind of marking
is required, nor is any record made necessary.
In the absence of State or local regulations the
marking of the boundaries perfects . the- loca-
FUcoTding notices of locationâThe Congres
sional laws do not In terms require a notice of
location, but they provide that where a record
of location is made such record shall contain
the name or names of the locators, the date of
the location, and such a description of the
claim located, by reference to some natural ob
ject or permanent monument, as will identi
fy the claim. In the absence of a State law
or local rule or. custom requiring a record to
be made. Congress has not undertaken to pre
scribe the nature of the notices which a miner
may be compelled by such laws, rules or cus
toms to post, or which he may see fit to post
on his own motion. It Is only where such
notice or Its equivalent, is required to ]â re
corded that the provisions of the Federal law
become mandatory. ' Where the State laws or
local rules- or customs require a record to he
made, the recorded instrument â¢must contain
at least the elements provided for by the laws
of Congress. *
Local rules and customsâ These provisions of
the Federal law are supplemented' by local
rules and customs which have the force of
law, excepting where they may conflict with
some State or . Federal law upon the same
subject. These local rules and customs are
not uniform throughout the "State and I could
not here undertake to enumerate their pro

may be recorded. Section 1189 of article 2 pro
vides:' 'â¢Instruments" entitled to be recorded
must be recorded by the County Recorder of
the county in which the real property affected
thereby Is situated." Section 119 of the county

must keep all books, records, maps and papers
deposited in his office."
Section 120 of. the county government net
' provides that the Recorder must record, upon
i the payment of his fees for the game, separate
! ly, in large and well-bound separate books, in
1 fair hand, such writings as are required or per
i mitted by law to be recorded. From the fore
going provisions it would appear that a notice
of location of a mining claim is entitled to be
recorded in the county In which the claim is
â ituated. That it is the duty of the County Ke
trlirders to keep books for that purpose and to
record the same, upon the payment of his fees,
in the same manner as he is required in record-
Ing other instruments.
There is at present no State or Federal law
requiring' notices of location to be recorded,
nor need they be recorded in the absence of any
local rule or custom to that effect. Heretofore
in many of the mining districts in tills State
the local rules and customs required that no
tices of location should he recorded in the office
of the County Recorder of the county In which
the claims were situated. That such notices
when so recorded might constitute a good and
legal record was doubtless the object the leg
islature had in view of making provision for
thf recording of Â«urh notices by the County
Recorder. As before stated, however, such
notices are not required to be recorded with
the County Recorder in the absence of a dis
trict rule or custom requiring the same.
Noteâ Jbere appears to be a slight error in
the wording of the repealing act of lÂ»v>fl, the
effect of which I have not considered. I have
assume.! in the foregoing that the act of IS'J7
was effectually repealed.
DESERTION THE

Senator Shortridge Is
the Defendant.
Mrs. Adele M. Shortridge filed suit yes

In her complaint Mrs. Shortridge says
that she married Senator Shortridge in
this State April 27. 1881. On October 1.
1897, she alleges that Senator Shortridge
deserted her and has since refused to live
with her. For these reasons sin- asks
that an absolute divorce be granted her,
together with the custody of her minor
children and her share of the community
property, which she alleges exceeds $liO,
--000 in value.

ENCINALS ENTERTAIN
Alameda Yachtsmen Open the Season
With a Vaudeville Performance
and a Dance.
Last night the Enoinal Yacht Club
opened the season with a vaudeville enter
tainment and dance in its home at Ala
meda. Dr. C. L. Tisdale in his introduc
tory remarks referred to tho loss by fire
of the annex and bowling alleys, whie})
have now been rebuilt.
The entertainment began with an amus
ing pantomime scene by Joseph Rosbor
ough. representing a Lady dressing and
then a man performing a hurried toilet.
Evidently tho ladles thought the per
formance realistic, for their applause was
generous. Charles Reynolds, prestidigita
teur, showed some clever conjuring tricks,
and James Nounan followed with solus
on the guitar. Mert Ireland, as Miss Hui
tense. newly arrived from Paris, gave a
clever character monologue and told aev
eral funny stories. \Y. J. Hynes kept the
audience laughing with some well told
tales and sang a song, the refrain of
which was "There'll be a hot time in the
old town on the day when Dewey comes
borne." By special request and for the
positively last time ho favored his au<li
ence with his well-known laughing song.
This concluded the entertainment, after
which the floor was cleared and dancing
was enjoyed to the music of Hynes' or
chestra.
All the yacht clubs on the bay are now
open for the season, the opening of the
Encinals having been delayed until ' the
completion of the reconstruction of the
annex.

THE THOMSON
111 HARD LUCK
ONCE MORE
Almost Destroyed by
Fire Last Night.
BURNED OVER THREE HOURS
LOST HER PROPELLER ON THE
LAST TRIP* TO PORT.
Fire Originated Somewhere in tha
Vicinity of the Engine Room.
Full Extent of the Dam
age Ib Not Known.
The "cherub which perches aloft and
watches out for poor Jack" seems to have
deserted the steamship Klihu Thomson.
On her last trip to this port the vessel
lost her propeller, and after having been
carried hither and thither by adverse
winds and currents was finally brought
into port by Captain Whitney, who
crowded canvas on every available pro
jection, even to the smokestack. Captain
Whitney was rewarded handsomely for
his grit. On Friday night last the vessel
again narrowly escaped total destruction,
not by water, but by fire.
When she came into port a Tow clays
ago she tied up at Howard-strest wharf
and discharged her cargo. Since fhen she
has been undergoing a complete overhaul
ing. Last night the watchman aboard
her smelled smoke, and Investigation
showed him that there was a blind lire :a
the vicinity of the engine-room. He noti
fied Officers McGrath and Whipple. wni
turned in a still alarm, bringing the lire
' uig Governor Markham and an en;;'.r â ; t i
1 the scene. A half hour's work Bhowed
that the Maze was still gaining heaawa.y
and an alarm was turned in at 9:30 Crota
hux SS. The firemen found it almost im
possible to get the fire under control.
There is little room to work aboard snl)>,
and the taster the water was pourvi in
the faster the smoke seemed to arse,
bi ating the firemen back and almost ariv-
Ing them ashore. At about 10 o'clock the
vessel began to list to starboard from the
weight of the water and extra lines wet a
thrown out. " , ,
The fire started amidships and workta
its way forward to the wheelhouso. At
about 12 o'clock it was finally under
control, but not until thousands of dollars
damage had been done. The cause of the
fire is unknown and it will be some day 3
before an accurate estimate of the dam
can be made.

Should the ordinance requiring these de
vices be valid, and it is said there is no
doubt as to its validity, the negligent
companies are liable to fines amounting
to immense sums. The ordinance was
passed ally February 23, 1894. It pro
vides that within thirty days after its
passage each company holding franchises
from the city of Oakland shall attach to
its cars a fender device of a practical
nature, standing not more than one and
a half inches above the rails and so con
structed as to prevent any person from
corning in contact with the wheels.
Within ten days after this period a de
scription of the particular device must
be filed with the City Council, and if ap- .'.
proved by that body ninety days are al
lowed in which to attach the accepted de
vice to every car owned by the company.
Under this ordinance by July i, 1894,
every street car running through Oak
land should have a life-saving fender at
tached to it. ....
The only company that complied with
the ordinance was the Piedmont road.
It equipped its cars with the Clark fen
der, which has been approved by officials
on both sides of the bay. The Piedmont
Company filed its notice with the Coun
cil, and later when the syndicate ob
tained control of the Grove street. Cen
tral avenue. Alameda. East Oakland and

two lines of the Southern Pacific have i
paid no attention to the ordinance, whicn
provides a penalty of $500 for each day
that it is disobeyed after the time on
which the fenders should be attached to
the ears. These roads still use a pice of
solid board in front of the trucks, com
ing to a point in the midle. and the
lower edge of which is from six inches to
a foot above the top of the rails. It was
BUch a tender that was attached to the
car that yesterday killed little Mace, and
the burned condition of his body is posi
tive proof that h* came in contact with
the wheels, in addition to being struck
by the board.
The inquest on the death nf Corlis
Mace, killed by the Hayward fenderless
car yesterday, was opened to-night, but
owing to the indisposition of Motorman
Tl. W. MeLane was postponed until next
Monday night.
BERKELEY MAY NOT
HAVE A PRESIDENT
THERE IS NO MONEY FOR HIS
SALARY.
BERKELEY, May 27.â There is every
probability that the Board of Regents of
the LJnlversitj of California will not elect
a president of the university for one and
perhaps two years. Instead of a head of
the faculty, who is also the chief execu
tive officer of the college. It is rumored
that they will resort to an expedient
which will leave vacant for some time to
come the position from which Martin I
Kellogg has recently resigned.
The reason for this sudden and impor
tant change of front on the part of the
regents is said to be due to the deplorable
state of finances which the balancing of
probable receipts and expenditures for the
i oming fiscal year reveals. If the report
el" the finance committee of the board be
correct the outlook for The university in i
a financial way is certainly cause for
alarm. Not only must all the departments I
be run upon the strictest basis of econ
omy but as things stand now the exepcted ;
deficit will result in the dropping cf sev
eral members of the instructing force and
a general retrenchment of salaries.
According to the figures from which the i
board is now estima tin.a: there will be a !
shortage after the next twelve months of
about $50,000. The smallest estimate is
$47,000. Of this amount about $25
counted as additional expense involved by
new buildings and increased attendance,
and about $22,000 for a falling off in annual
receipts. As the president's salary is to
be $10 .'W per annum. a clear saving of this
sum would be quite a consideration to
those who face with anxiety the impend
ing deficit. It is understood that the in
tended plan of the regents in deferring
indefinitely the election of President Kel
loffg's successor comes from a desire to
save the item of that officer's salary from
the expected deficieny.
In place of a president it is said that
the regents expect to resort to the expedi
ent of a governing board. This is to be
composed of one or two members of the
regent body and two or three membi
the faculty. The chairman of the
will be the acting executive official of the
university, with power to sign all neces
sary documents and papers. The name?
of the professors who may act in this ca
pacity have not yet been mentioned.

THE SAN 'FKANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAT 28, 1893.
SOUGHT EAGLES'
NESTS AND MET
A! AWFUL FATE
Disappearance of W.
G. Trimble Solved.
HE DIED AT NYAK, ALASKA
HIS HAT FOUND NEAR THE TOP
OF A HIGH CLiFF.
It Us Supposed He Climbed After an
Eagle's Nest and Losing His
Grip Fell Into the Sea
and Drowned.
, Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. May 27.
The mysterious disappearance and sub
sequent death last May of William G.
Trimble, who formerly resided with his
father at Berkeley, has been solved, and !
the supposed manner of his demise was |
revealed this afternoon through a petition
for letters of administration on the estate
filed by his father, Joel B. Trimble.
The petition sets forth that William G.
Trimble died on May 22, 1898, at Xy.ik.
seven milrs fr^m Karluk, on the Kodiak
Islands. Alaska, and that the estate, so
far as known consists of a $200) life in
surance policy and personal property
amounting to $25.
It develops now that when young Trim
ble left his home in Berkeley in the early
part of last year he went to Alaska there I
to be employed at the fisheries of Hume j
Bros. The season not having opened
Trimble looked about for recreation and
sport, and hit upon the idea of seeking
eagles' nests. He had arranged with an
other young man at ihe fisheries to go to
Nyak on May 22 last for that purpose,
but there was some hitch and the other
man could not accompany him. so that he
was compelled to make the journey alone. I
He w< nt in one of Hume Bros.' boats and
has never been seen since.
The next day, however, men were sent |
to Bearch for him at Nyak. They were I
unable to locate him, but afterward found
Trimble's hat near the top of one of the i
cliffs, where he had evidently climbed to '
reach an eagle's nest. It is the accepted i
theory, therefore, that Trimble lost his
grip and tumbled into the waters below, j
where he was drowned in a depth of
twenty feet. There was no ether means ,
by which he could leave the island alive
than by the company's boat. The body |
has never been recovered, l>ut the facts
as narrated will be used at the hearing of
the father's petition as proof of the son's
death. _

MRS. LAHL WAS KILLED
BY AN UNKNOWN PERSON
EARLY lnst Wednesday morninpr Mrs.
Lucy Lahl, the deserted wife of
Edward Lahl, formerly a con
ductor on the Powell-street
â  cable line, died in the home of her
; mother and stepfather. Mr. and Mrs.
: Stephen C. Glover, 1933 Mason street. An
i autopsy by Morgue Surgeon Zabala dis-
I closed the fact that the woman had died
; from a criminal operation.
The victim was 16 years and 10 months
old and had been married to her heartless
husband only ten months. Thirteen years
ago the father of the girl was killed on
the corner of Twenty-eighth and Church
streets by a man named Mullen. From
the testimony taken yesterday before
Coroner Hill It appeared that the girl had
not lived as comfortably as she should
and that her husband had abused her be
fore he went away.
Mrs. Anne Collins, grandmother of the
dead girl, told a sensational story on the
the call of the President offered their
services and went to the front.
After the close of the address, which
was received with great applause, the
committee announced that dancing was in
order, and there was a programme of
dances that continued until midnight.

HALL COMES TO GRIEF.
After Having a Woman Arrested He
Is Himself Thrown in Jail.
William Hall, a member of the Kansas
regiment, Friday night caused the arrest
of a young woman giving her name as
May Smith for stealing $5 from him. Ac
cording to his story he rode to the Cliff
House on a bicycle and there met the
woman. After buying a number of drinks
Hall found his purse empty and- at the
suggestion of the woman, he claims he
sold his wheel for $r>. While he was con
verslng with her the soldier declares that
the woman deftly abstracted the gold
piece from his pocket. Al't'-r niis.-ing the
money Hall Bummoncd Policeman Mylar,
who, afttr listening to his story, placed
the woman under arrest. At the City
Prison she was formally charged with
larceny.
Last evening Hall was himself arrested
on a charge of misdemeanor embezzle
witness stand. She lives at 70S Howard
street with Mrs. Emma Rollins, formerly
Mrs. Lambert. She swore that Mrs.
Glover had asked her for the loan of $25
fur the purpose of having a criminal op
eration performed upon Mrs. Lahl. Mrs.
(Mover flatly contradicted Mrs. Collins on
this point and said she had no knowledge
whatever as to the author or the mode of
her daughter's death.
The girl called her shortly after mid
night and asked for a cup of coffee, after
drinking which she expired. Mr. Glover

bicycle which he sold from J. T. Barnes, j
who has a cyclery near Golden Gate Park. I
Barnes last night visited the City Prison i
and positively identified Hall as the man I
who had "borrowed" the wheel.

AET SHOW CLOSES.
California Club Ladies Find Their
First Exhibition a Success.
The first annual exhibition of the in
dustrial arts of California under the aus
pices of the California â¢ Club closed last
night at Mechanics' Pavilion after a suc
cessful week. The beautifully furnished
annex held a crowd that found difficulty
in moving- about at â¢ times, so densely .
were the people packed. Almost as great
a throng viewed the artistic handiwork of ,
Californians during the afternoon. On I
both occasions attractive musical pro
grammes were offered the visitors.
The closing day was called "President's
day." in honor of Mrs/ -La veil White, the
head of the club of tireless women. She â 
was assisted in receiving afternoon and '
evening by, the board of directors of the i
club, trie ladies of the finance committee |
of the exhibition, members of the hospital j
section and directors of the Porteous
Club. They were kept busy for many
hours greeting their callers.
In planning the exhibition the ladies of
the California Club had no desire to make
money. They merely wished to put be
fore the people of the State the products
of hands engaged in the industrial arts.
They would have been satisfied even had
they been a little out of pocket, and they
rather expected they would be. They
were, therefore, agreeably disappointed at
the indications early in the week that
they would be on the right side of the
ledger. Day by day the crowds increased
until last night, when the banner throng
assembled.

The Supreme Court has upheld the deci
sion of the lower court of _Los Angeles
County in the case of AY. L. Archer
against Daniel Freeman and the Cente
nela Inglewood Land Company. The suit
was brought to recover damages alleged
to have been sustained by reason of mis
representation. Archer lived in the East,
and claimed that he was induced, together
with a man named Thompson, to purchase
land in the tract of the defendants. He
said that it was represented to him that
the tract was to be improved and upon it
would be built a college to be called the
University of Southern California. Also
that Freeman was to donate $100,000 to the
improvement of the property. He claimed
that it was not until some time after the
purchase that he learned that he had
bought a gold brick, there being no such
improvement as promised. In the lower
court his case was thrown out on a non
suit, the Judge deriding that it was barred
by the statute of limitation.

Died of Laudanum Poisoning.
E^ Hoar, a widow residing at
Kl9 Lombard street, died yesterday after-
Inoon apparently from laudanum poison
; inpr. She has been ill for some time past,
' and Friday night took a strong dose of,
laudanum and paregoric. The double
I opiate rendered her unconscious, and Dr.
Glover was summoned, but he could not
I save her life. It is thought that death
was purely accidental, as her relatives
Bay they know of no reason why she
should take her own life.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Viola Alice Rhodes has sued her hus
hand, Lewis M. Rhodes, for a divorce.
The plaintiff charges her husband with

went at once for his brother. Dr. Cosmas |
Glover, who, after a brief examination, j
pronounced Mrs. Lahl dead and advised
nlnl to notify the Coroner.
Glover corroborated the story told by
his wife. He had neither knowledge nor i
suspicion as to the guilty person. At this :
stage of tne proceedings Coroner Hill â 
interjected dramatically:
"You are under oath, and it is your duty
and my duty to find out who killed this ;
girl. This girl has been murdered. With
proper care and attention, even if a crlmi- i
nal operation had been performed, she
might have recovered. I repeat it, she
was deliberately murdered, and this crime !
must be punished."
The witness persisted that he knew
nothing of the affair other than what he
had told. Dr. Cosmas Glover corroborated
his brother's testimony sis to his having
been called in after the death of the girl.
The jury bro ht in a verdict to the ef
fect that the woman had been murdered
by unknown persons.
Mrs. Elizabeth Bullwinkle caused a
mild sensation by repeating what her son
Fred had told her regarding a statement
made tn him by the deceased to the effect
that Mrs. Lahl suspected Lahl of having
been the man who stole a sack of coin
belonging to the Wells-Fargo Express
Company from a wagon standing in front
of the Anglo-California Bank last March.
Lahl is said to be in Los Angeles at the
present time.
THE LOVER'S LEAP.
The Romance and Reality of
Woman's Love.
Of all lover's leaps sung in song or
told in story, that was the greatest.
Do you remember the story as Mr.
Browning tells it in the rhyme of the
Duchess May? A tale of those fierce
feudal times when might was right and
when the law was writ in the sharp
edge of a man's sword? Sir Guy had
stolen away the bride of a rival suitor.
And now that rival has besieged the
castle, which has sheltered their brief
happiness, until there is no more use in
defense. In despair Sir Guy climbs to
the topmost tower and sends for his
steed. He will take one leap from the
battlements and die like a man. But
his wife hears the steed's hoofs on the
stair, and follows. It was the horse
that had borne them on the night of
their bridal, swift and safe from pur
suing vassals, and her hand was on the
bridle when spouse and steed swept out
upon the tower.
Down, she knelt at her lord's knee
and she looked up silently.
And he kissed her twice and thrice
for that look within her eyes.
Which he could not bear to see.
Then putting her away from him, he
bade her go back to her tiring room
and her maids. But she by wifely
bond and woman's love swore that in
death or life she would not be parted
from him. He turned and sprang to
the saddle, but she caught and clung to
the stirrup rein. With bit and spur he
backed his horse for that wild leap
from the battlements, "whence a hun
dred feet went down." But she still
clung, half swooning, her hair sweeping
the ground and her limbs dragging.
Three times her husband broke her
clasp, and three times her hands closed
again with the same convulsive clutch.
Then, as commending her to God, he
pressed his horse back for the fearful
leap, love gave her almost superhuman
strength and she climbed to the saddle
with himâ "By her love she overcame."
And her head was on his breast,
whore she smiled like one nt rest.
Â» â¢ â¢ â¢
Then the horse in stark despair with his
front hoofs poised in air.
On the last verge rears amain.
â¢ â¢ * â¢
Now he hangs, he rocks between, and
his nostrils curdle in.
Now he shivers head and hoof, and
the flakes of foam fall off.
And his face grows fierce and thin.
Then back-toppling, crashing back.
a dead weight flung out to wrack,
Horse and riders overfell.
Oh! men sigh, that was a woman to
die for. There are no such women now
adays. The high heroism is a thing of
the past. Let the man who thinks so
go into his kitchen a while- and watch
his wife, worn and weary, while he
ponders this saying:
It's harder to live with the average
man than to die with him.
There are doubtless women, worn out,
broken down, crushed by the duties of
wifehood and motherhood, who would
gladly trade all these years of suffering
and pain for the few joyous months
that followed marriage, and then like
the Duchess May, smile at the dark
leap, with the arms of the man she
loved close clasping her.
Every wife, every mother is a hero
ine. Is there no courage in putting that
little hand into yours, and forsaking
father and mother for your sake? Is
there no heroism in assuming the re
sponsibility and risk of motherhood?
It is doubly heroic when the young
woman can look around her and see
what loss marriage so often entails, loss
of health, of figure, of complexion, of
strength.
The best recognition that can be
given to the heroism of women id that
which minimizes its perils and smooths
the path of duty as much as is possi
ble. It's a very beautiful thing to have
a monument setting forth the virtues
of the wife and mother, with a weep
ing husband hanging wreaths about it.
But it is a very much more beautiful
thing to be a happy, healthy woman
and a "joyful mother of children."
The crown of motherhood ought not
to be a crown of martyrdom.
The most practical recognition of the
worth of woman, her courage, her suf
fering and her needs, is to be found in
that "Godsend to women," Doctor
Pierre's Favorite Prescription. There
is no extravagance in that statement.
The martyrdom of motherhood is done
away by the use of this great remedy
for female troubles, debilitating drains,
and the inflammation and ulceration
which cause such suffering.
"I would like to express my grati
tude to you for the benefit I have re
ceived from your wonderful medicine,
Dr. Pierre's Favorite Prescription,"
writes Mrs. H. C Anderson of Smith
Britain, New Haven Co., Conn. (Box
33). "During the first month after I
found I was going to becomp a mother
I could not keep anything on my sto
mach. Was so sick that I had to go
to bed and stay for weeks. In fact. I
went to bed the 28th of June and never
got up till the first of August. I tried
different doctors, but with little bene
fit. I read about many being helped by
using your medicine, so I thought I
would give it a trial. I began to take
your "Favorite Prescription' in Novem
ber and "I hnd a nice little baby girl in
February following. My baby weighed
over eight pounds. I was only in hard
labor about one hour and got along
nicely during confinement; was up and
dressed on the eighth day. I never had
the doctor with me at all; just the
nurse and one or two friends. My
friends thought I was sick a very short
time. I think Dr. Pierces Favorite Pre
scription is indeed a true 'mother's
friend,' for it helped me wonderfully.
It kept me from having a miscarriage.
This makes my second child; with the
first one I did not take "Favorite Pre
scription' and I had a miscarriage.
The little one lived just about two
months and she war-- Pick all the time.
This last baby is as plump and healthy
as any mother could wish. She is about
three weeks old now and is gaining in
flesh every day."
That letter offers a practical exam
ple of what "Favorite Prescription" has
done for thousands of women. Almost
all the letters received by Dr. Pierce
dwell on the wonderful absence of pain,
the cheerful spirits, the perfectly safe
and comfortable feeling as the hour of
trial draws near, and then the crown
ing surprise of all. that tha ordeal of
the birth hour is so short and almost
painless. But a good many other wo
men are pleased to tell the other side
of the story, how robust their health
becomes, how fine the form and fair
the face that follows the use of this
health-giving medicine.
Mrs. Mary E. Lewis of Tanner, Gil-
mer Co., W. Va., writes: "I will al
ways recommend Dr. Pierces Golden
Medical Discovery. â¢Favorite Prescrip
tion' and 'Pleasant Pellets,' for they
cured me when doctors and other medi
cines failed. For fifteen years I suf
fered untold misery. When I com
menced taking Dr. "Pierces medicines
I had given up all hope of ever getting
well. I could not He down to sleep and
everything I ate would almost cramp
me to death. Was very nervous and
could hardly walk across the room. I
only weighed ninety pounds when I
commenced taking these medicines six
years ago; I now weigh one hundred
and forty pounds and am having bet
ter health than ever before. My friends
all say they can hardly believe that I
am the same person; after being sick
so long I have changed to be robust
and rosy cheeked. I have taken fifteen
bottles of the 'Prescription,' fifteen of
the 'Discovery' and fifteen of the 'Pel
lets.' I take great pleasure in recom
mending your medicines to the sick, for
I know that if it had not been for them
I would not have been living to-day.
I am very thankful to God, who put
the great power in your medicines that
cured me."
The secret of these changes in
health and appearance is easily ex
plained. The general health of women
cannot be separated from the local
health of the delicate and sensitive wo
manly organs. When these are dis
eased, the whole health suffers. The
nerves are affected, and the result is
sleeplessness and restlessness. The
functions of the tomach are disturbed
and the body suffers from lack or nu
trition. Offensive drains sap the
strength and undermine the constitu
tion, while female weakness and ulcer
ation and inflammation afflict the mind
as well as affect the body.
The action of "Favorite Prescription"
is such that all the delicate and sensi
tive womanly organs are promptly
helped and purely healed. Debilitating
drains are dried up. inflammation and
ulceration healed, female weakness
cured and the whole of the organs pe
culiarly feminine are given vigor and
elasticity. As a resul* of this the baby's
coming is not dreaded, and its advent
entails no trial beyond the natural
strength. When local health is thus
established the causes of the hollow
cheek, dull eye and thin form are taken
away.
Sick women are invited to consult Dr.
R. V. Pierca by letter without charge.
For more than thirty years as chief
consulting physician of the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute at Buffalo,
N. V., Dr. Pierce has made the treat
ment of diseases of women his special
study. Of half a millii n ases treated
ninety-eight women out of every hun
dred have been perfectly and perma
nently cured. It's a wonderful record,
attested by grateful letters from wo
men in evpry part of the country.
There is positively no charge for such
consultation. Every letter is held as
strictly private and sacredly confiden
tial, and to preserve that privacy
throughout all answers are mailed in
perfectly plain envelopes without
printing or advertising upo them.
Write without fear as without fee.
Designing men sometimes invite wo
men to "write to a woman" on the scor>-Â»
of receiving "a woman's sympathy" and
that "a woman understands woman's
ailments." The "bearded lady" is evi
dently not found in tho dime museum
alone. The fallacy of such statements
is evident when it is considered that if

IS HELPLESS
Si AFRAID
OF HIS LIFE
Attorney P. G. Trus-
seau in Trouble.
Attorney N. FS. Malville, an .old man,
was arrested yesterday on a warrant
charging him with disturbing the peace
and he gave $20 ball for his release. The
complaining witness is Krnest Lang, a
watchmaker at 2821 Mission street.
When the case Is called to-morrow
morning in Acting Police Judge Groez
inger's court Interesting developments are
expected. Lang's mother, Mrs. P. G.
Trusseau, died last Tuesday after a few
days' illness. Trusseau, her husband,
who is an attorney, is practically help
less from paralysis, and when Mrs. M.
Oaborne, Miss Amelia AmiÂ£t and Attorney
Joseph J. Cognet attended the funeral
last Thursday Trusseau wanted to see
them privately, but Lang prevented it.
' Cognet and the two ladies called the
following day to condole with the hus
band, ami while waiting' outside were
joined by Attorney Malvllle, who had
acted for Trusseau and his wife in a pro
fessional capacity. The four went to the
door, which was "nened by Lang. wKo
promptly forbade them to enter the house.
Malville wanted to know where Mrs.
Trusseau's will was. and Lang denied
there was one. Malville then, notwith
standing Lang's threatening attitude,
pushed his way past him and was fol
lowed by Mrs. OsSorne, as they were de
termined to see Trusseau.
Lang got excited and sent for a police
man from the Seventeenth street station
and wanted Malville and Mrs. OSDOrne
arrested, but the officer declined to inter
fere. Malville and Mrs. Osborne saw
Trusseau and he begged them to get him
out of the house and sent somewhere,
even to the City and County Hospital, as
he was afarid of his life; but they had

There is a question of property rights
â which Malvillo, Mrs. Osborno "and the
other witnesses say is at the bottom of
Lang's actions. The day before Mrs.
Trusseau died she made a transfer to
Lang of all her property unknown to her
paralyzed husband, and the friends of the
husband say that they will light the
transfer, as Mrs. Trusseau was dying at
the time and did not know what she was

LEGITIMATE MINING.
The Industry, as Now Conducted in
This State, Is on a Business
Basis.
In place of gambling and speculating in
the purchase of shares of stock in promis
cuous companies, the opportunity is now
presented of acquiring an interest in the
very valuable property owned by the
American Quartz Mining Company on
the most favorable and advantageous
terms.
This company, incorporated under the
laws of the State of California, has a
capital stock of $100,000, divided into 100,000
shares of the par valueof onedollar ($1) per
share. Its property comprises five claims
of 1500 feet by GOO feet on the mother lode,
situated in the French Gulch mining dis
trict, Shasta County, State of California,
at about 24 miles northeasterly of Red
ding, the county seat. It has a mill of ten
stamps, with ample water power to run
the same for eight months In the year,
with an engine and boiler of 30 horsepower
for the remainder of the year, together
with other necessary buildings.
The property has been opened up with
tunnels, shafts, drifts and winzes. Ore
bodies have been tested and proven to be
of great value, average assays by Luck
hardt, Pugh & Fowler showing $14 free
gold.
The successful operations have demon
strated the desirability of attacking the
ore bodies at a further depth of 2;"0 feet.
which will permit the ore to be delivered
4000 feet nearer the mill than from the
present workings. The distance from the
mouth of the proposed tunnel to the mill
will then be 2130 feet, and by means of a
gra\'ity tramway the cost of mining and
delivering the ore to the mill will not ex
ceed $110 per ton, a saving as compared
with the cost of present working of $2 65
per ton.
This property lies in a belt of very rich
gold mines, among- which may be men
tioned the famous Brown Bear mine,
whose productions to date is stated at 11
to 12 millions: the Scorpion mine, with an
output of $375,000: the Shafter, $fKXÂ» oon-

eral productions. $3.f>10,72S having boon ex

The directors now offer for sale to the

able in monthly installments of 10 cents
per share per month, beyond which no
other assessments or payments will be
required.

The New Memorial Day
Oup Soldier Graves in Cuba.
By henry Harrison Lewis, Special Corespondent
Special to The Sunday Call.
_,__HE removal of the soldier dead
j^"" from Cuba and Porto Rico dur-
Oing the past few months has
served to make vacant a great
majority of the graves in those
islands, but the transports, de
spite their frequent trips, have . not
;aken all. There are still enough down
here to make the celebration of May
!0, lS9fÂ». a celebration unparalleled in
>ur history.. â¢
There are men â soldiers who _ have
{night other foes on those pestilential
itiores than the Spanishâ who have a
:la im for the honor and reverence of
heir countrymen. The earth upon their
graves is" newly turned and about them
Lho silent colony grows â augmented
lay by day by. the stricken ones from
the hospitals.
The action of the United States Gov
tnunent in transferring to ..heir own
land those who fell in its service is un
precedented. And it is a source of
wonder to the Cuban native*. These
Â,\u-v have seen, great transports load
id with the dead sail away from their
island many times since the f. rst or the
year, and they marvel at a nation
which is willing and eager to spend
Lime and money in moving those whose
usefulness is past.
And they will marvel still more at
the spirit which will prompt the Amer
ican soldiers on Memorial day to deck
with -flowers and flags mounds of
earth and weep at the memory of com
rades gone to the last call.
In the vicinity of Havana and other
large cities the day will be carefully
observed. The great grave in which
the 'boys of the Maine lie side by Bide,
and those smaller ones filled since that
eventful week in March, 189$, will come
in for the due- share, but in no part of
the island will the day be one of such
tender ceremony and importance as In
the vicinity of Santiago.
Back of that city the battlefield
stretches' for miles. It. extends coast
wise* in the direction of Baiquiri,. and
away to the mountains on the El Ca
ney road. It was fought over Inch by
inch, sprinkled .as . with a . Bummer
shower by the blood of the combatants,
and then sown with the graves of those
who fell. Little care was possible un
der the circumstances, 'and where men
dropped they were buried.'- Some were
enshrouded in the canvas of their shel
ter tents, "but the majority had as their
covering only their uniforms and the
clods of mother earth.
Where the Dead Lie.
There was no orderly arrangement,
no rows and aisles and plots and sec
tions, but merely the convenience of
vicinity and the haphazard use of the
Spanish. and American trenches. On
the Santiago battlefield, after the ces
sation of hostilities, the density of the
craves served as an undeniable evi
The Call Sunday Edition
dence of the mortality at that particu
lar point. At the foot and on the San
Juan Hill they were sown as thickly
as tenants in the God's acre of a popu
lous city.
By permission of the American .Gov
ernment disinterring has been carried
on in a more or less desultory fashion
since last September. Despite the fact
tha"t disturbance of graves in semi
tropical countries like Cuba is strictly
forbidden within five years from date
of burial, friends and undertakers
flocked to the Santiago batttlefield,
armed with permits.. from the War "De
partment at Washington, and removed
a number, of bodies.
It was only through the strenuous
efforts of General Leonard Wood that'
yellow fever victims .were left undis
turbed. In one case an " undertaker
from a Maine town insisted on disin
terring an officer who had died of yel
low fever, and he yielded only to force.
The hasty method of burial followed
during the excitement after the siege
naturally led to' wrong identification in
many cases. When convenient a bottle
containing a paper hearing the name,
regiment and company of the deceased,
was. buried with him. Rude boards ud
un which were painted similar inform
ation were planted at the heads of the
mounds, but despitevthese precautions
the identity of the soldier often re
mained problematical. * â 
When a delegation of Spanish officials
visited Santiago for the purpose of
removing the remains of the brave de
fender of El Caney, Genera] Vara del
Key. they experienced great difficulty
in finding the grave. They were led by
a Cuban guide to a mound in th vi
cinity of the blockhouse, but on open-
Ing the grave disclosed to view the
remains of an army mule. It was a
despicable, Blur and insult cast upon
the memory of a gallant warrior by
natives, whose sense of refinement is
notably absent.
In strong contrast to this is the pa
thetic sympathy felt by the living sol
diers around Santiago for their com
rades in the trenches. There are .very
few graves on the battlefield that have
not .beert the object of tender care.
Decoration day has lasted many long
months in that part of Cuba.
This sympathy has been manifested
in strange ways and in unexpected
quarters. Last October a negro team
ster was discharged from the service
in Santiago as incorrigible. He was a
native of South Carolina, and was a
peculiarly vicious specimen of a vicious
class. He had been arrested and pun
ished so many times without effect that
his dismissal was finally ordered..
He was paid off â poor little sum â
and given a pass on a transport to the
United States. â¢ Sailing day, this de
praved negro visited all the shops in
Santiago and, buying, as many Ameri
can flags as his money permitted, went
out to the trenches and decorated a
number of soldier graves â black, white,
American and. Spanish indiscriminately.
Then he returned to his evil" ways. -.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, MAY 28, 1899.
"LET OUR FL^G WJiVE OVER THEM,
LET OUR FLOWERS DECK, THEIR GRAVES"
General Nelson (\. Miles, Commander-in-Chief, U. S. (\.
SIIK graves of our dead soldiers command the respect and veneration of all. Particularly this year, when there
are at Arlington a large number of new-made mounds; when or. the hillsides of Cuba and Porto Rico, and about
the swamps of the Philippines, other American soldiers are buried, we should think of and decorate the graves
of our heroic dead.
This custom comes to us from the ancient and refined Athenians. They were accustomed to celebrate the
virtues and commemorate the memory of the heroic dead by decorating their graves each year. For us to do
the same thing is certain to result in o'ir benefit. It will perpetuate the spirit of patriotism in our youths and help
them to emulate the example of the men who died bravely. :;ot only iii our Civil War. but in our recent war with
Spain. The idea of and the ceremonies of Decoration day are beautiful. Its purpose is commendable. This year, of all
years, should be observed with patriotic devotion.
During the last twelve months nearly twelve million of people who were living under a tyranny and despotism
hive been freed from their serfdom arid have become a part of the? population of these great United States. Those
among them who really know the changed condition hail the change with joy and gladness. Their gratitude is like that
of Lazarus toward Christ. They realize that the American people has not been slow to offer the flower of its manhood
to rescue them from thralldom and that, if it is given time, it will establish a stable government under which they
can live in peace and happiness. Of course Ido not know more than any one else what is likely to happen in the
Philippines. With other good citizens. I hope that the contest will be short and that the people in our new posses
-!"U-- wiil be willing to listen to reason instead of compelling us to further use force. Our troops there have mani
fested the same bravery, the same heroic fortitude and spirit of self-sacrifice as were shown in Cuba and Porto Rico,
and have been sho\?n since the beginning of American history, and as will be shown until American history ends. We
have !<>-t good men. In warfare those who die are naturally those whom we consider best.
When Memorial day conies there will be new graves. Out at Arlington now the freshly turned earth shows
where the men who died in Cuba and Porto Rico lie buried. Not all of them are dead. Green mounds on the sides of
the hills near (iuasimas. and about San Juan, will be decked with the rxnl. white and blue on the 30th of May. The men
who died in Cuba, the men who died in Porto Rico, the men who died ami are dying in the Philippines, are just a*
much entitled to commendation and consideration as the men who died in any war in our history.
Let our flag wave over them, let our flowers deck their graves wherever they may be; let our reverence, let our
respect, let our love, wreathe their memories.
Heroes all! They deserve all that we can grant them â they deserve more than we can give them!

THE Memo/iaL day of th^ futtire
will mean much more to the
American people than in the
past. Its significance will be
broader, deeper, more truly na
tional.
It will mean not only the commem
oration of those heroes. who fell fight

"but, for the first time since its institu
tion, it "ill be an anniversary of a
common sorrow, the surest and most
effectual peacemaker either in family
or nation.
The Spanish war 'has done more for
Memorial day in the space of one short
year than could have been accom

<;LY in the bare red of its mo
-1 I notony of newly turned clay, the
f I new graves of the soldiers, dead
in the Spanish-American war,
will pitifully bear their flowers
this Memorial day.
It was Sunday afternoon when 1
drove out to Arlington. Holiday-makers
swarmed into the great national grave
yard as if it were a picnic, ground. The
spreading trees and rich turf of the old
cemetery were green and peaceful.
Where lay the dead heroes of our Civil
War was solemnity, but no sadness.
The scars of that great conflict had
been obliterated by time. But where
the new graves are is this great red
blot â a tremendous wound in the sward
to tel! a^Btory, awesome and as full of
heartache as it is of glory.
Almost precisely a year before I had
traveled about from camp to camp and
come to know our soldiers. I had
messed and camped with the gallant
Ninth Cavalry: I had gone to Cuba
with the surgeons and the hospital
corps; I had gone Into battle with the
Rough Riders and fought with them
and bled with them. Among the brave,
black troopers of the Ninth I numbered
scores of friends. Among the Rough
Riders there wns scarcely a man whom
I did not personally know. Day after
day, since the time when battle and
disease began among these my friends,
I had watched the records, and I knew
who were dead. I wanted earnestly to
find their graves. Rut on the long rows
of tiny ' tombstones there^ were no

The day should he sacred as God's

not the intercession and tender solici

From the battlefield of Fredericks

served with a new spirit, the patriotic
offering of a united people.
The American people to-day, live in
the prospect of a glorious future, a
future not only great for themselves
but fraught with happiness and liberty
to the downtrodden millions whom
their valor and justice have made free.
It is not alone that we honor the

names; Each had its. inexpressive, un
romantic number. On one or two some
reverent one had scratched a name in
lead pencil, but they were all strange
names to me. A pleasant man came
from the office of the cemetery with, at
first, some merriment. He showed me
the map of the. graves. I looked at it
with eager interest. I looked away as
quickly when I saw the long rows
marked "unknown."' It seems to me a
pity that our Government does not
make some plan by which the identity
of the men who go out to fight for it
shall be certainly preserved.

Then 1 drove back to the graves.
They were not wreathed with flowers,
as one would have. expected them to be
just after they had been made, but
from each one floated a little flag. They
were pitiful little flags, those bits of
color on our soldiers* new graves. They
were made of. the cheapest cloth, and
the red and the blue in them was sten
cilled on with cheap paint, which will
run down and spoil the white stripes
when the first rain comes. On one or
two of all .the thousand graves were
tiny nosegays. _ I fancy that they had
been put there by a little .girl that
morning. I saw her going about weep
ing, with some other bunches of flowers
in her hands. She told me that no one
she knew had been buried there, but
that her "big brother" had been killed
in the Philippines.
The graves were dug by contract,
doubtless, and are arranged in rows so
regularly that they make straight lines
no matter in what position you stand
as you view them.

brave on Memorial day and bedeck the
graves of those fallen, that freedom
may be perp< tuated, i>ut we make it
;) day of consecrated joy that we still
possess the blessings sn richly won.
The nation has a profound sorrow for
the warring Filipinos and the uncon
tented Cubans to whom as yet these
tributes can have no meaning. The
firm, kind hand of Justice seems to
them only an exchange of masters, but
they will in days to come venerate the
memory of the American soldiers who
sacrifice d their lives to give them lib
erty. They will remember their deeds
of valor, their steady discipline and on
ward rush, and they will not foriet the
grand exhibition of personal heroism,
which was not courage born of the ex

Memorial day will yet be hallowed by
the : people who now spurn our' Hag's

It is a festival of memory made eter

tender recollections cherish the deeds
of those heroes of ours.
It is a day of glad grief that freedom
and unity still reign.26

K. M. HOLLAND, Columbia Theaterâ
This is the hand of a genius especially
adapted to his line of work. His broad
palm Indicates the breadth and scope of
his mind. He is original and adaptable.
Can execute well, but has not the power
to instruct. He lacks patience. He can
portray any character, as his powers of
mimicry are unusual. He is strong
willed and determined. Easily ' Irritated
by the stupidity of others. There Is great
constructive and inventive genius, not
along mechanical lines, but in his- own
profession. \He is an actor by nature
rather than from training. He grasps a
situation Intuitively and If called upon
for a reason could not easily explain why
he comes to his conclusions. This is a
thoroughly natural nature with love for
all the pleasures of the world, yet provi
dent withal. He is thoroughly Bohemian
in his instincts and is not eager for re
sponsibility. It would be best for this
nature not to allow itself to become an
gered, as they lose control when enraged
and would say and -do that which they
would have occasion to regret. This -na
ture cannot endure dictation or re
straint. A natural born leader and can
not take a secondary position. The well
defined knots on the fingers show that the
artistic gifts of a higher order are in
terfered with by a tendency to practica
bility which will not be silenced. He will
be more successful financially, but must
depart from his ideal. This discord will
render the subject at times moody and
dissatisfied.
MISS M. PACIIECO, Guatemalaâ This
palm indicates a pleasure loving, nature.
There is marked musical talent, yet un
less urged this nature would not reach
the highest mark, as there is great" Indo

71 YE, take the "White Man's Burden,"
CjL And glory in the place
Mutations of strange peoples
Have thrust upon your race;
Reck not the price it costs ye,
Thought be "the best ye breed,"
For Freedom is no phantasm,
Nor Liberty mere creed.
Strong in the "White Man's Burden,"
Grand in your brawn and pride.
Ye have the mighty nerve power
'In patience to abide."
Rich generations gave ye
The brain to think and plan;
Gtudge not the aeons' blessings
To the "child-devil" man.
Revere the "White Man's Burden,'* '
To break the iron rod;
To loose the superstitions
Which make of man a clod;
Cleave prison walls of ignorance,
The former centuries' dower.
Let in the light of knowledge,
Though blows seem cruel power.
Yield not the "White Man's Burden,"
Good work for others wrought
Toward high civilization,
"The end for others sought";
The best accepted service
Upon life's altar laid
Is sacrifice for others
In willing offering made.
Scorn not the "White Man's Burden,"
E'en "serf and sweeper toil,"
Nor fear that "heathen folly"
Your labors shall despoil;
believe in courting trouble nor crossing
a bridge until he comes to it." He is
generous and free-hearted and vould have
been much more so if there had not been
a strong influence to balance this ten
dency.
McGINNIS. Yolo Countyâ You have I

your life; two ef the individuals will fall

ble, loving friend, always the first to as

selfish man. Your domestic life has not I
been as it might have been.
C. A. 8., Los Gatosâ This is the hand \
of a man of health and strength, but
weak mentality. You are far too fond of
liquor for your own good. One marriage, j
B. P. WRJEN, Tacomaâ l fear your im- j
â pressions must have been lost. Send \
again and you shall hear from them.
MARK M.. Visaliaâ You are a man of i
power and a public-spirited, energetic
person, but must lead or create trouble, i

life.

practical and methodical. Like wine, you'
improve with age. Very keen observer,
â¢fond of the opposite sex. Sunny disposition
and very imaginative. You will come
near yet escape accidents and dangers.
You have a tendency to grow stout and
to have trouble with your legs. You "will
have an out-of-door existence,' which you j
require for your health. Brain power
goodâ combative, argumentative and de
ceptive. Money matters all right.
MISS E. SANTAâ Heart line is too deep
and you won't listen to advice. You leave
old friends for the new. Reckless and in
different. Going to have a strange life,
many changes which you voluntarily
seek. You had better settle down or you
will regret your folly. You spoil your

Accept the "White Man's Burden,"
As duty's master stroke.

And know your God shall show It
To those who give ye jeers,
There is a verdict higher
Than "judgment of your peers."
Then hail the "White Man's Burden,'*

be pinched or smoothed into better shape.

Answers to Correspor)der)ts.
PUZZLED ONEâ The prepared cream
you mention contains, 1 think, a small
quantity of corrosive sublimate. It acts
d< lightfully with some skins. Whether it
would agree with yours or not of course I
could not possibly say. The only way you
could tell would l>e to experiment with it.
1 myself would prefer to use a little pure
lemon juice in connection with a home
mride cold cream.
ROLY POLYâ If you will send me a
stamped addressed envelope .1 will tell
you where you can get the complexion
brush. Am pleased that you have found
the orange flower skin food a source of
such delight.
NORA BRADFORDâ am sorry I could
not reply by mail, as you requested : .but
you did not Inclose a stamp, and besides
I only answer through the paper unless
it is to give an address or other informa
tion' that cannot be printed in these col
umns. The moles can be removed with
acetic acid. Dip the end of a wooden
toothpick in the acid and with it touch
the center of the mole. Make an appli
cation each night for three nights, then
lei it alone. A scab will form, which in
the arse of a couple of weeks will drop
nff, Icing the mole with it. Care must
be taken not to get the acid on any of
the white skin surrounding the mole, else
a scar will result. There "is nothing
better than sweet cream to remove sun
burn. â¢
B. BRUNETTEâ Buttermilk is a sim
ple and excellent remedy for the removal
of tan. If this is not available, then use
lemon Juice, following its application with

Ini. rr.:Â«! trouble, In either case I should
advise him to consult ;i specialist. When
Di-- spots take on that shiny appearance
there is vrry little hope for coaxing; the
hair to grow in again. However you
mipht try rubbing the spots nipht and

This will sometimes induce a downy
growth. It really would not be worth

is such a small quantity called for in the

MAGNETâ Your first question has been
answered several times in these columns
since your letter was written. I hope you
saw and were Informed. No, witch hazel
will not cause hair to grow. A few appli

how long its use must be continued.
Trousseau, a celebrated French physi
cian, claimed that two grammes of bicar
bonate of soda taken at each meal would
reduce flesh. It will not injure the com

for the toilet vinegar. An excellent lo
tion for clearing the skin and refining
coarse pores Is made with: Five and a
half ounces elderflower water; one ounce
eau de cologne; one ounce fresh,- un
cooked cucumber juice, and one-half
ounce simple tincture of benzoin. Mix
the elderflower water and benzoin and let
them stand a few hours, then strain
through muslin. Mix the eau de cologne
arid cucumber juice, and then add the
other ingredients. Apply several â  times
a day, letting It dry on the skin. As long
as the skin is kept in a state of perfect
cleanliness It doesn't really, matter
whether the bath is taken warm or cold,
as far as beauty is concerned. If you
are sufficiently robust to stand a cold
bath you will find it invigorating and
helpful. If not, then I should advise a
tepid bath. You will find the hot bath,
or vapor bath, most efficacious in reduc
ing flesh. The orange flower skin food
will fill out the hollows in the face.
I doubt if cutting the eyelashes will have

MRS, BURTON HARRISON
IT almost looks as if the houses of the
beau monde had ceased to be homes.
Certainly this is beginning to be
the case in New York, where a
couple owning one of the beautiful
establishments uptown may often be
found in it only for a small part of
the winter season, and are then engaged
Jn a ceaseless round of giving and taking
entertainments to and from their friends.
Most of that set dine out five evenings of
the week, and on the sixth receive people
â in return. When the disposition of the.
! seventh evening comes under discussion,
; and there seems a reasonable prospect of
j a man having to spend it in unbroken
j communion with the partner of his joys,
j there is always the alternative of bring
ing together a few friends in the palm
garden of .a modish restaurant, or of the
la4y retiring to her bedroom, with a book
and a cup of tea, and sending her .husband
to his club.
The old-fashioned Darby and Joan tete-

i in their cribs upstairs,, are so rare as to
hardly enter into consideration of fashion
able folk. When, by accident, these oc

sort finds anything to say to the other.
The demands of so many dinners past has
pumped dry their supply of small talk.
They gaze at each other with somnambu
listic eyes and think how nice it would be
to meet "out" and feel" the impetus of
having to keep up.
Madame has an opportunity to observe
that her lord's hair needs cutting; he,
that her complexion is going a little "off."

one ounce; glycerin, one ounce; tincture

the skin I know of nothing quite so lovely
as cucumber milk, which is not at all
difficult to compound. The formula is:
Two ounces oil of sweet almonds, ten
ounces fresh cucumber juice (boiled), one
fourth ounce powdered castile soap, dis
solved in three ounces of essence of cu

Clocks of Bygone Days-
IN the town of Schramberg, in the
Black Forest district of Wurtemberg,
Germany, where fine of the chief in
dustries is that of clock making, there
has recently been established an interest
ing museum of timepieces. The collection
displays the gradual development in the
making of clocks tor many centuries.
Among the curiosities are many of
great historical value. There is an alarm
Clock constructed in the year 1680 for the
use of travelers. In form it resembles i
lantern, and the interior is designed to
hold a lighted candle.
The candle is slowly pushed upward by
a Bpring, which also controls the mechan
ism of the clock. At little pair of shears
â¢ lips the wick of the candle automati
cally every minute to regulate its light.
The lantern is inclosed with movable
sides, so that the sleeper is not at first
disturbed by the presence of the light.
The alarm is set by inserting a peg
in the second dial plate. When the
quired hour arrives the alarm is sound
ed, ami at the same time the movable
Bides fall, Hooding the room with light.
Among the curiosities is a Japanese saw

rASHIONS
THE evolution of the negligee is as
interesting as it is instructive. The
negligee was once a "combing
jacket;" then it graduated into a
"matinee," and finally evoluted
into a "negligee."
Each of these transformations likewise
marks an epoch in society. In the "comb
ing- jacket" days we were a people with
simple tastes. Each bonny bride num
bered in her trousseau a half dozen
"combing jackets" made of tennis flan
nel and unadorned. Tneir use was exact
ly what their name signifiedâ a jackei to
be warn when combing the hair.
When society began to put on frills the
"combing jacket? discarded its sim
plicity for furbelows. It crept out of its
chrysalis of tennis flannels into lawn and
: silk, ribbons and laces. It took unto itself
a new mime, the "matinee," borrowed
from la belle Parisienne, who had always
I worn these dainty little sacques.
From the "matinee" to the "negligee"
was but a short step. But the first negli
gees were not the "creations" that they
are nowadays. They were simple, loose,
wrapper-llki gowns, and not particularly
beautiful. The ne^li^ee of to-day is a
soft, shimmering affair, with billowy
laces and dainty ribbons. One must pos
sess a half dozen of these, going up the
Male beautiful until a "dream of loveli
ness" is reached, to be worn in the after
neon.
For be it known that it is now the
proper thing in New York to appear in
negligee from 2 until 4 in the afternoon
and to receive all visitors who come dur
um those two hours. The wave of Anglo
maniacism is responsible for this. Ii is
ilit tiling for our English cousins to puff

this custom have likewise become addict

The quarrels of servants, the airs of
governesses, the tantrums of tutors, the
accidents to horses, the failures of chefs,
the inconvenient minor maladies of child
hood that have a fatal way of inter
rupting the pleasures of their elders in
full swing! All of these drawbacks may
conspire against the full enjoyment of so
called home life in summer among our
rich and great.
And supposing that terrible woman
comes into the neighborhood with whom
one's husband set up a flirtation the sea
son before in town. Supposing one's
daughter or son of marriageable age has
taken a fancy to some detrimental person:
Supposing a mother-in-law arrives self
invited for a "good long visit to 'her dear
ones"â this or any other contingency of
like grewsome importâ and pray what
comfort is there to the owner of a great
house and its appendages?
Little by little the home idea vanishes
out of a life cast into such a mold. With
the best intentions to guide them, what
chance has the people who are living it
to cultivate the humble hearthstone vir
tues that flourish best in a quiet, restful
atmosphere?
Their existence is like the ante-cham
ber of a sovereignâ thronged from the
rising of the sun unto its going down with
courtiers who bow and bend and sa>
graceful nothings, yet are set upon fur
thering their own advancement and grati
fication.
The demand upon the means and time of
this variety of our citizens is incessant;
It Is impossible that theirs should be a
purely selfish career; they cannot, if they
would, get away from giving and con
tributing and working for schemes char
itable and humanitarian. But the rush of
It and the strain give them no moments
to call their own. And, indeed, the easi
est and commonest method of dealing
with the problem of home life seems to
be to get out of It for as long a space as
possible. A decade ago we would have
cried out upon such a state of things.
Now we accept it as the end of the cen
tury's immutable decree. â Mrs. Burtou

There is a world of comfort to be had In

that one must indulge in fin de siecle ac
cessories when wearing them. Taking
mine ease in mine negligee is the delight

Miss Leila Ellis, a San Francisco girl,
now playing with the Kelcey-Shannon
company, has some very beautiful negli
gees, as the accompanying photographs
will illustrate. They are not too elaborate,
yet have all that airy-fairy flufflness with
out which a negligee is a dismal failure.
A negligee need not be unduly expen
sive. Using inexpensive material one
could copy these gowns very effectively
and at a very small cost relatively.
The negligees take on two formsâ the
petticoat and sacque, or the loose flowing
robe. The petticoat plays a leading role
with either of these. With the sacque it
divides the attention equally. With the
flowing gown it plays bopeep. But the
. glimpses of the petticoat must reveal a
bewitching combination' of lace and lawn
and baby ribbon.
Slippers and stockings are a serious
consideration with the negligee. They
must be exquisitely daint*- for though the
negligee is long, it is so constructed that
it falls apart, and the feet "like little mice
peep in and out." and if they are not
daintily shod the harmony is destroyed.
A dainty woman never looks as well in
, anything as in one of these negligees. Ii
is the half-concealing, half-revealing
charm of the gown that makes it so tan
talizirigly beautiful.

The bonnet was pretty, too. Can you

JUST now about the happiest girt
in the world is she who expects
to graduate this month or next.
She deserves her happiness, too,
for she has worked hard to win her lau
rels. Let us be careful to find out just
what gift would be most welcome on her
graduation day. and to keep our eyes
open for the prettiest of gowns.
Among gifts of jewelry the little gold
watch with its chain will always stand in
high favor. Cuff links of uncut opals
would be sure to please most girls. A
belt clasp or buckle of the new rose gold
would make an appropriate gift. The al
ways useful stickpin is popular with all
women. The articles <>f jewelry that
would please the girl graduate are end
less.
Another line of appropriate gifts is to
be found in pretty accessories for the
bedroom. For instance, a bureau set
of ivory with monogram in silver. An
outfit for a desk would also make an ex
cellent graduation present. Books with
pretty, dainty bindings are just the thing.
There are pictures innumerable which
would please the average girl.
If she is musical, a banjo, guitar or
mandolin would probably be very wel
come.
Under the head of useful presents would
come an umbrella, parasol, handkerchiefs
or a new dress.
Things in leather make nice gifts.
Among them a grip, traveling clock, cal
endar, pocketbook, cardcase or chate
laine bag, are all suitable for a young
girl. .
A. fan of gauze or silk, ornamented with
a water color or spangles, is always a
popular graduation gift.
On â¢ all the momentous days of a
woman's existence she wears white
gowns, so do not succumb to any passing
notion that a pale blue or pink dress will
do to graduate in. If the gown is made
over a silk slip such materials as mull,
organdie and silk muslin are suitable.
China or India silk gowns are very grace
ful, and perhaps : more in the general
mode.
Where simplicity and a washable dress
are desired, the materials from which to
select are India linen. French nainsook,
Persian lawn, dimities and embroidered
Swisses. Any of these, trimmed with Val
enciennes lace, tucks and ribbons, makes
an ideal graduation gown.

THEY are delightfully interesting chil
dren, these little ones of George J.
Gould. An afternoon spent in their
playrooms in Georgian court, Lake
wood, the winter home of the family, has
left the happiest sort of impression on
my mind.
To be sure, there was rather a formida
ble array of governesses and white
aproned nurses in evidence, and the ex
quisite daintiness of the^ little girls' frocks
and boots made childish frolics quite an
impossibility. Yet they are gracious, af
fectionate little bodies, and must surely
develop into women of charm and beauty.
They have the same dark, glorious eyes
and hair that their mother has and a
grace of movement one rarely sees in
children.
Such playrooms as they have! The en
tir<- floor of one wing Is given over to
them, and there is no end to the pretty,
childish things that go to make it a per

told me. and have just recently been put

coiffure and long trailing' robes, besides

are the daintiest of canopied cradles for
them to lie in and exquisite carriages to
take the air in.

the time for the hunt is near at hand," said Aaron. noinitatlne
There was a pause, and during this pause a hare, a small P al P lta "'Â»
creature, came creeping from the s?dge and sat looking at Aaron : an i i _-
children. Some movement or other frightened her and she bou "^ e t , '', ' s ,;
Old Scar-Face disappeared in the tunnel like a shadow, and P reppnt '-\,Y,,. nY

"What hurt the rabbit ?" asked Sweetest Susan. "I think It s a sname,
she crifd. when Aaron motioned with his hand to indicate the wx. Â£*
she spoke old Scar-Face appeared at the door of the tunnel. At ms ieei
lay the rabbit. Â i^ir^
Sweetest Susan looked appealingly at Aaron; but appealing looKb
couldn't bring the hare hack to life. . ., T . .â¢+
"I feel better." remarked old Scar-Face, licking his chops. I ha\ en t
had a good dinner for two suns. They are hard to catch.
"You are' getting old," suggested Aaron.
"Yes, old; but 1 gave this little creature a fair chance.
"II was a quick ratch." Aaron declared. Â
"Neat, if not quick," said old Scar-Face, with an air of pride. I m old.
!>nt not too old for thisâ not too old to lead into the middle winds this great
dog \ou tell of."
"What are the 'Middle Winds?' " Buster John asked in a whisper.
"Where there is no scent," Aaron explained.
"There la scent enough," remarked old Scar-Face, "but it is lifted from
ground and grass by the winds. Yes, I will lead this wonderful dog into
the middle winds and leave him there; or I will carry him to the barren
places where the ground is red and dry. or where the sand has difted. X
Is now three years since I have done more than trot before the dogs they
bring. What I need, Son of Ben All, is something to stir the blood and
make me thir3ty."
"This dog they will bring will give you what you want," said Aaron.
"He is called HodO."
"What it that, Son of Ben All?"
"It is his name."
"Well, my name is Woodrangor. What do your kind call me, Son of
Ben Ali?"
"II is as good as any." said the fox.
"Yes, one name is as good as another when you have three meals a
day." Aaron assented.
"There was a time." suggested old Scar-Face, "when the Son of Ren
All killed and brought me birds: hut that time is past."
"You are no longer weak nnd young. But 1 came to-day to do you a
better turn than that. I came to warn you of this dog from a strange set
tlement) whose nose is so keen that he never puts it to the ground, and
whose U'trs are so strong that he but touches the top of a ten-rail fence
as he goes over. Take my word for it: iet not another sun rise on you
hero till the grass is green again. ( >o to the river: hide in thf big swamp:
Btay anywhere but here. I-et thp dog with the queer name run down and
kill on- of your brethren. Do you move away for a time, and go where
the hunters m.ny not follow."
Old Scar-Face tried to reach with his hind foot a flea that was tickling
him on the top of his back near his shoulder and in making the effort he
stretched out' his neck, closed his eye and grinned so comically that the
children lauerhed.
"Pome and I'll scratch you." said Aaron.
Old Scar-Face took a step forward, but hppitated. "No. Son of Ben.
Ali." h" said. "It makes me cold to be too near the new ones."
Whereupon Aaron himself took a step forward and scratched old Scar-
Fa in the back with a pine con<\ and this operation seemed to be so
pleasing that the fox kept time to the scratching by patting the ground
with one of his hind fÂ»et. as though he were trying In this way to aid
Aaron. When old Scar-Face had been thoroughly scratched along the
spine] where his hind foot could not reach, he shook himself, licked his
chops and seemed to feel very much better.
"Ancj so you think 1 should move away from my home. Son of Ben
Ali." old Scar-Face remarked. "Well, if you had come saying. 'M_v friend.
you are in danger; fly and remain away many suns.' to-morrow's dawn
would have found me milr>s away. But when you say. 'Beware of tho
U'igs: there- is one called Hodo cOMing to run you down,' that is different.
1 want to hear this strange dog yelping behind me, not too close, but far
i Dough away to make him weary. I want to hear the noise of* his yelp, or
know that he is running wildly hither and yonder, sick to know where the
Woodranger has gone."
"As you please, old friend." said Aaron. "This Hodo has made great
talk among the hunters. 1 have, warned you: it is ail I can do."
"THÂ«rr have been swift dogs aftpr me. Son of Ben AH: but they have
always been behind me. Not one of thr-m has ever untangled the loops of
r;i\ tangle; noi one have 1 ever carried into the middle winds. This strange
ill- I should litfe to carry there if he has strength enough; once there, I'll
bid him Kooil-by."
"You'll be'surprised if he tells you howdy," suggested Aaron.
"So would you. Sun of Ben All."
"No; you're wrong; it would be. no surprise to mo." Aaron replied.
"You have won many a race: you have broken down many a pack of
hounds: but you are not as young as you were. And something tells me
thai If you were in your prime this hound would outfoot you. I know
what \ know."
"And 1 Know what T can do. Son of B<^n Ali; and I'll show you when
the time cornea. I'll give this hound a warm scent, and I'll cut out for him
a journey he'll long remember."
"This thing of remembering." said Aaron, "depends on whether you are
well enough to remember. I hope you'll be well enough for that when the
race Is over."
"Don't worry about me, Son of Ben Ali. Many things I know were

to forestall you in the business of

As to "In Missnura" I have little to

feeling of anything but confidence.
And, as served me ri<-ht, I was hap

The libretto is by Charles Alfred Byrne

brilliant in Its dialogue and charming in
Its music. It affords a splendid oppor

Jhe Burmese Juggling Wonders
THE Orphcuni has found a new phe
nomenon in the race of bipods. It
is in the person of Monng Toon and
MnuriÃ Ohot, the chocolate colored,
young men from Burmah, whose
chief charms are in thoir eloquent
feet that have been taught to take the
plarce of their hands, and while they are
on the suise it seema as though thpso
self-same feet, soft and polished as india
rubber, would run the whole of human
(motions. Mming Tog/i appears on the
stage entirely naked except for a breech
cloth and a turban. He faces the audi
ence in the full glory of his India-ink tat
too, his hands hanging straight down, in
ert and motionless; then he starts in to
juggle two glass halls, such as we would
hang on a Christmas? tree, in a way that
would put to shame the most expert jug
gler, but' all his work In throwing, catch
ing and tossing is done with those elo
quent feet.
He deftly balanced one ball on his
shoulder, a gentle shrug and the shining
t>all glides around his neck more quickly
than the eye can follow .another twist
and the ball slides off the shoulder and is
speeding toward the floor, but the foot
tiles up to meet it and the little globe is
caught in the hollow that lies between the
ankle and shin bone. Another quick jerk
of the foot and again the ball goes back
to the shoulder. Next the ball slides
across the rhoulder and drops, but it
never reaches the floor. The quick foot
is outstretched and this time the ball Is
caught on top of the foot and its out
stretched toes. Moung Toon then pro
ceeds to vary this programme, doing one
trick after another until the audience
stares in wonder.
The first part of the act by Moung
Toon and Moung net is in imitation of a
game of football as played in Burmah.
A small hollow wicker ball is used and the
game as played in their native land may
start with any number of players, who
stand in a circle. One player etarts the
ball and It is the duty of the man toward
whom it may fall to catch it with his
feet before it can strike the ground. He
â¢must then, by striking the ball with his
shoulder, thigh, leg or foot, toss it on to
the next man. Should he miss catching
the ball and let it so to the ground or
.touch it wtih his hands it is a foul and
that player is out. So the game goes on
until only two players remain. Then the
real contest begins, for they are usually
the two crack players of the town.
According to Moung Tonn everybody
plays this kind of tuotball in Burmah.
Children begin it as soon as they are old
enough to play at anything and by the
time they are young men they have de
veloped into experts, but th-ey do not stop
then. Moung Toon say a that old men still
play the game for fun with their children
and for money with rival old men.

Potato Gure for J^Keu^natism
AMONG th>e many curiosities pulled
out of an Irishman's pocket one d;iy
in a vain search for a coin wa.- a
little black object that looked like
a hard, round piece of agate. A friend ex
pressed -astonishment at the man's carry
ing; such a thing in his pocket and asked
him why he did it.
"Why, man alive," Pat exclaimed, "that
is not a stone, bbt just a potato, and,
sure, I carry it with me to cure me rheu
matics. I have two about me," said Pat,
diving down into his other pocket and
bringing forth the mate of the first curi
ous looking potato, as Pat swore it was.
Upon investigation it was fonnd that
Pat had much method in his madness.
Potatoes among old country people have
been looked upon for many years as a
preventive of rheumatism. Small, round,
smooth potatoes are chosen, and are put
in each pocket of the trousers. Soon the
potatoes become black, but they never
rot; they seem to be petrified, and it ia
claimed they take the poison of the dis
ease out of the system.
At any rate, the remedy is a simple
one and'wyii werth a trial.

NEW YOKK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YOKK. May 27.â There was a marked
Alspositlon in the Stock Exchange dealings to
the speculation in railroads anil in
diutrlai specialties. The Immobility of the
standard railroad stocks in the face of the
demoralization In Sugar and -Metropolitan
Railway was strikingly like the mid
numnier markets of yore When Sugar was
likely to absorb a half to three-quarters of
the total dealings and when many of the In
dustrials now traded in had not yet been con
ceived. The bears seemed to have gathered
fresh courage and made quite a savage on
slaught upon Sugar, the Tobacco stocks, the
>>w York municipal stocks, smelter and steel
end Wire. Losses in the railway list were
insignificant in most cases. There was a sim
ultaneous decline in New York <~entrul and
Pennsylvania, which was in rather marked
contrast to tin' later strength of some so-called
differential trunk lines.
The first hour had not expired before an ac
tive demand sprang up tor tlie li>-.i>liiu securi
ties, based "n the strong showing of the April
â  earnings. A decrease in operat-
Kpenses of the coal company and an in
â¢ Lrnings by the railroad com
pany combined to produce an increase in net
earnings for all the companies ol $107,013, In
connection with the good report submitted by
New Jersey Central earlier In the week and
th< May trr.>ss earnings of Ontario and West
ern, i 1 leveloped uuit~ a buoyant tone
loyed substantial wiins all around. Erie
first preferred shared in the advantage. The
rise in ...ese Btocks \\;is carried to other rail
road stocks and checked liy the decline in
the specialties, short covering causing rallies
tween one and two points. The failure
market m show any marked response to
the bank statement induced v fresh raid by
the bears which carried Sugar .i'.wn t" 145,
an extreme decline from yesterday's close of
Ints. The mark. -i yielded in sympathy,
the specialties quit, sharply and the railroads
only slightly. The market closed under pres
ut v*ii net gains remaining tor most
of the railrC&d â â¢'â  eks. â¢
Ide mii unusual show uf
. h for a Saturday with a rise of VS cent
due to the hardening money rate in London
and the demand on that center from the Conti
nent for gold*
In connection with the plethoric condition
here -dosed by the weekly Dank statement, !
there Is some renewed apprehension of gold â 
exports. . . ...â  demand for railroad bonds con
tinue* strong at advancing pries. Heading ;
4f being most conspicuous. The exchange will j
remain closed until Wednesday.
When the exchange <if uncertainty regard- i
ing the fate of the coming crop conies aroimd,
speculation in stocks by the outside public
proverbially falls to a minimum and the stock
market is left to the professional room trad
ers. The very fact of outside neglect â â¢'â¢ the
market deprives it of support, bo that the 1
professionals are almost invariably bears in a
dull stock market and bulls in a dull wheat â¢
market, in accordance with the possible effect
of crop failure In the two markets. That Ims
been the state of affairs during the past week.
Nearly every professional trader on the Stock
Exchange has been a bear this week." The
late recovery in pries is not conclusive evi
dence or a definite Indication of a change of
heart, as the professional traders look with I
apprehension always on a few days' interval '
of inaction and Its possibilities of Important
developments.
The heavy decline in values compared with
the corresponding period of last year, the rise
In value of Import*, and the persistent rise in
the rate of sterling exchange were all inci
dents to reinforce the argument that our ,
credit balance abroad has been exhausted, and
that a movement outward of gold was likely.
The languid tone of securities of numerous in- '
dustrial combinations was a striking indica
tion of the satiated condition of the public de
mand for them, and was taken to foreshow the
danger Âf a break in prices generally of those
which were of inflated value and in weak
hands, which might demoralize prices gener
ally. There were evidences not lost sight of |
by the bears of a desire to realize on some of
the heavy holdings taken over by powerful In- j
terests to check the panic due to Mr. Flower's
death. Much was made also of the Impairment
to values of an Important group of stocks that |
would result from the enactment of a public
franchise tax bill by the New York Legislature. '
On these various assumptions the bean sold
stocks quite assiduously during the early part
of the week. A number of things during the
week changed the confidence in a coming re
action in prices. Most important was the ex
cellent traffic returns of railroad! for the third j
week in May. Heginnlng with St. Paul on
Wednesday with an increase of J3G.000 on gross i
earnings over last year, there was practically
no exception to the favorable returns. As the
comparison Is with an unprecedented period
last year it could not fail to have force. Re
ports of damage to European crops during the
week suggested a future price for wheat that
Would attract a movement of the reserve in !
farmers' hands constituting the invisible sup
ply, the amount of which is believed to be large
In spite of the large movement last year. It i
was sufficiently obvious that the declines In
prices of stocks Induced by the short selling did
not bring out any large offering of stocks, ar
guing confidence in the holders in their future i
value. There has been a pretty steady demand I
from abroad for the standard railroad stock
and outgoing steamers carry large shipments
of securities. The growing caution of the pub
lic toward Issues of new industrial combination* ,
and a falling off of the furore of speculation
in such i,ssu>-s Is unquestionably a healthy
symptom, and makes for financial safety. The
detailed statement of the April foreign trade
showed a number of favorable features es
pecially the large proportion of the Increase of ]
Imports, included in "articles In a crude state
for domestic Industry." Of the total net in-!
crease in imports of 19,148,077 this Item ab- I
sorbed J.".. 316. 417. The prevailing ease or money I
and the activity reported by specialists in the
various departments of trade and business
were all reassuring factors. There has been a
very notable demand for all available issues i
of railroad mortgages during the whole week
There was a moderate absorption of gilt-edged
and government bonds. But the favorites . are
new Issues for refunding and reorganization
purposes in course of disposal by reorganiza
tion syndicates, and which may presumably
hope for a stable higher range of prices
after this floating supply has been absorbed by
Investors. The United States old fours coupons :

NEW YORK'S FINANCIAL CONDITION.
NEW YORK. May 27.â The Financier saysi
The surplus reserve of the New York Clear
ing-house banks is now . higher than reported
for eleven months, the gain of $9,302,200 for the
week ending May 27 having swelled the total to
$43,933,723. The feature of the current exhibit
's the reduction of $17,500,000 In loans and the
contraction of $12,666,000 in deposits. Reserve
requirements, by reason of the heavy deposit
change, were reduced by over $3,000,000, and
this, added to the $6,0u0,000 gain in cash, raised
the excess funds in banks more than $0,000,000.
Taking the known operations of the week as a
basis, the greater part of the cash expansion
should be attributed to Interior movements,
but this is misleading. The National City
Bank, for instance, which figures prominent in
the statement, reports a gain of more than
$?,000,0u0 In cash, nearly all in gold. Its loan*
are down $16,000,000 and deposits nearly $7,000,
--000. This la probably due in part to operations
connected with the financing of the amalgam
ated copper subscriptions. The Interesting fea
lure disclosed by such an analysis is that
whereas the banks as a whole have gained
enormously, the reserves of the majority of the
Institutions do not vary much from those of the
previous week. .In other words, the gain . in
rash has been made by a few banks. It is In
correct, however, to fay that this is actually
the case, for the supply of money* held by
nearly every financial institution in New York
is much in excess of the demand. Considered
broadly, the statement Indicates a prolonged
period of easy rates. One factor which is at
tracting some attention Is the condition of the
sterling exchange market. There is a possi
bility that with a continued piling up of money
here and a falling in rates, international
â  credits cannot be operated to advantage and
actual exports of gold may follow. The only
thing that can well prevent such an occurrence
is the maintenance of money here at something
above the level prevailing abroad. >..
Whether this can be done depends largely on
a revival in speculative activity. It is certain,
however, that* for every dollar of gold which
may be lost this season a greater number will
1* gained from Europe in the fall.

HIDES, TALLOW, WOOL AND HOPS.
Jacob Wollner's circular says: "Our Wool
market this month looks something like the
anti-free Wool tariff days.' There : has been a
rushing business -for the* past five weeks, and
at ; least \ 10,000,000 pounds have changed hands.
Everybody Is busy, \ the scouring -. mills E and
presses are all running and there Is a great de
mand for all kinds of Wool. Of course prices
are not â as ! high as 1 could be expected from a
high protective tariff, but still it Is from 50 to
75 per cent higher than under the free ..Wool
tariff. With the ' condition of the .European
market for fine Wools, we should have much
; better prices, but there are still lota of * old
Wonls and woolen goods on hand which were
rushed In before the tariff went into effect two
years ago, and it may take a year yet before
extreme prices are reached. The people, with
all the prosperity and higher wages, still want
cheap clothing, and manufacturers cannot ob
tain high prices for their goods made entirely
of Wool, so the bulk of goods sold now is made
up largely of very little Wool and a great deal
of shoddy and cotton. The goods so manu
factured look well, but do not wear well. The
country is well cleaned up of Wool and tne
only .Wools to be marketed yet in California
are the Humboldt and Mendocino Wools. Ne
vada is well cleaned up, but In Oregon the
season is late, but old Wools are moving freely.
Sheep and lambs still command good prices."

even to Biddy in the kitchen.
This time Biddy was certainly lifted

Then she seized a broom and snatched

The man seemed surprised.

Then he held up a bottle exactly like
Biddy's.
"The bag is the same, and th* 3 bot

WHO expects to have a good timeâ and adventures â during the vaca

to the country from the cities; some will visit the cities from the
country; others will" stay at home. You will all wish to know how your
friends 'are enjoying the season of freedom from study. How can you get
that knowledge? .The best way will be to write to. the Boys' and Girls' Page
of The Call. The interest will depend largely upon your skill in descrip

The Call could not be made large enough to hold all that you can all write,
for your number is equal to an army. Some stories might be crowded out. The
first" rule is that the best will be printed, providing that the length does not
exceed 500 words. It is necessary to make a limit as to length. There will
be room for good stories. More than this, this promise is held out to you
that the writers of the best six stories will have their portraits in The Call,
with brief biographical sketches of the writers, on the Boys' and Girls' Page.

The Lady in Grey
A DEAR little lady all dressed In gray,
Sits at her door-step spinning
away.
Her bright eyes a-spying all that
go by,
And nodding with pleasure to beo
or to fly.
Under an ivy leaf glossy and green.
This fair little lady's home can be seen,
Everything in it as neat as a pin.
For none but My Lady goes out and
comes in.
She's a great little worker, this lady in
gray.
Spinning webs of fine silk both by night
and by day,
Which she weaves into nets of figures so
line,
Then hangs them to dry by her door on
a line.
In the morn's ruddy sunlight, each tiny
thread
Seoms strung with diamonds and rubies
red.
And the delicate nets of our lady in
gray
Entice all the flyers that fly that way.

Abandon the schoolroom, of wisdom we've store,
The joys of vacation are with us once more!
Loiter the meadow and angle the brook,
Slumber and dream in some leaf-shadowed nook.
Hail the bright sun in his overland race
Till freckles and tan are abloom on your face.
Ho for the woodland, the river, the sea!
Lay down your burdens and laugh with great Glee.
Abandon the schoolroom, of wisdom we've store,
The joys of vacation are with us once more!

t THE SOFT ANSWER THAT
â¦ TURNED AWAY WRATH
WON'T it be fine to see our
stories come out in the pa
per? I really can't believe
it," said Rose, and the dark
eyes sparkled with pleasure.
"If they accept them it will," was
Ethel's quiet response. "That's so,
answered Rose, and the bright look
faded from her face, but instantly
lighted up* again, as she said: "Well, if
they don't accept these we will write
some more. Won't we? Now let us
read." And taking up a volume of
Dickens' works she began to read, but
Ethel interrupted her by saying, "Jes
sie said she would come here to-day,"
then looking at the clock, "it is about
time she was coming."
It was a cold December day and the
girls were sitting in a large old-fash
ioned library in Ethel's home, which
her grandfather had used for his study
when he was living. The walls were
CHAS W. MCCABE
OAKLAND
lined with books, and old-fashioned
pictures hung on the wall. Busts of
musicians, authors and famous men
stared at you from all sides of the
room, looking down from their stands.
Large, old-fashioned chairs, a table
and writing desk, a piano and a violin
completed the furnishings of the room.
Ethel and Rose were fast friends and
both being very fond of reading spent
many pleasant hours in the old study.
They were sitting before a table, both
in one chair. Two manuscripts were
lying before them, tied with blue rib
bons, and they had been looking very
intently on them. They were stories
which the girls had written to send to
the paper and they were anticipating
the pleasure in seeing their stories
come out in print.
Just then Jessie did come, with her
curls bobbing up and down, and im
mediately seated herself, saying,
"Hello, girls. I've brought my sewing.
I'll sew while you read.
Ethel was a blue-eyed girl of four
teen, brown hair, pink cheeks, very
quiet, sweet tempered, kind and happy,
and had altogether a very amiable dis
position.
Rose was a happy, jolly, active,
quick-tempered but kind girl of thir
teen years- '.if age and loved by every
one. She had bright black eyes, short
brown braids, a round, chubby face,
rosy cheeks and a laughing mouth.
Jessie was also thirteen years of age.
She had yellow curls, which bobbed up
and down on all occasions, blue-gray
eyes, fair complexion, and dimpfe's
played on either cheek; rather distant,
very polite and lady-like.
As Jessie entered the room the girls
quickly hid their manuscripts, for it
was to be a secret, and a surprise to
Jessie. But being to perceive
Jessie saw that the girls were hiding
direction. Soon you get into a car, the
nearest one to you. Well, suppose that
it is a Hai^ht-street car. After you
are seated you will no doubt look out
of the car windows. If you were sit
ting on the north side of the car you
would see, looking through the BOUtiS
windows, as you rode along, the tallest
building in the city, the Claus Spreckels
building. You will ride through miles
of streets, lined with stores and resi
dences. Finally you will come to where
the car will stop. That is at the en
trance to Golden Gate Park.
You can now walk along a gravel
path, with beautiful cultivated and
wild flowers on both sides. You come
upon an open space covered with grass
and fenced off with trees, which is the
baseball grounds, and there are amuse
ments for men and boys. After leaving
this you see the children's playground,

something from her and quietly in
quired what it was, but the girls only
smiled in response. Jessie, rising from
her seat, said, "Please, girls, tei) mo
what it is," and going to the writing
desk where Ethel had put the stories.
She opened the lid and took up
the manuscript written by Ethel,
which was entitled. "A 'Garden
of Roses," and with an ex
clamation of delight said, "Oh! I
know what you girls have been doing;
writing stories for the paper." and she
began to read it aloud, but Ethel quick
ly snatched it, Baying, "I shouldn't
think you would do that, Jessie. We
were going to surprise you. Look! you
are tearing it. Plpase be careful," "but
Jessie had fast hold of one end. "I
don't think you should hide things
from me when I come," she said.
Anger sparkled in Rose's dark ey.es as
she beheld the once neat paper
wrinkled and torn, and starting up she
stammered out, "You mean thing."
Ethel had released her hold and wag
looking hopelessly upon her story, and
in a moment of anger Jessie tore the
manuscript into little pieces. Rose
sprang toward her to save it, but it
was too late, for there it lay upon the
carpet, ail wrinkled and torn. Before
either girl could realize what had hap
pened Jessie was walking from the
room, her curls bobbing more than
ever, saying as she went, "If I'm not
wanted here, good-by then," and with
a stiff bow she left the two girls to
look wistfully after her as she went
down the stairs and up the hill without
looking behind once, while Ethel paid:
"Now she \z mad. What shall we do?"
Then she got up, went to the piano
and ran her fingers lightly over the
keys to smooth down P se's ruffled
feelings, but when she realized that the.
story she had worked so hard over wa3
torn and that her other copy had been
destroyed she burst into sobs. "If I
were you I wouldn't care about her,
but when you see her again tell her
she needn't come down here any more
if she is going to act that way," said
â Rose, with an angry toss of her head.
Ethel did not answer, but putting on
her hat said: "I am going to tell Jessie
to come back again and not be angry."
"Going to tell her to come back
again," repeated Rose. "Well, I never
saw such a girl as you are: always for
giving somebody " But Ethel was
down at the gate by that time. It had
started snowing and Jessie was far out
of sight. She ran back into the house,
wrote a note to Jessie, saying she hoped
she was not angry and she was sorry
if she had treated her impolitely. Th n n
putting on her cloak she went out again
into the snow. Rose had gone home to
wait for Ether to return.
Jessie's home was about two miles
from Ethel's home. Ethel kept walk
ing on and on, though the snow waa
falling faster an^l faster and it
kept growing colder and colder.
She reached Jessie's home at last,
put the note under the door, rang the
bell and started on her course home
ward. A great wind had come up and
snow was blowing in all directions, the
storm was still increasing and Ethel
was getting stiff and cold, but she still
ran on. till fairly exhausted she sat to
rest upon the snow.
A long time did Rose wait for Ethel
to return, but no Ethel did return, un
til at last Ethel's mother grew anxious
and sent Ethel's elder brother for her.
They found her lying stiff and cold in
the snow. She was brought home and
put to bed and she tossed all night upon
the bed, but while she lay awake she
felt her reward of forgiveness was the
peace at heart. Two other girls lay
awake that night, one repenting for
her unkind act and wondering how the
other could he so kind, the other wish
ing she had been as kind as her friend.
The next day after school Rose went
over to see Ethel, but they did not sit
in the library, as usual, for Ethel lay
propped up in pillows and Rose was
reading to her, when Mary, the hired
girl, said that a friend wished to see
her. "Bring her in here, Mary," said
Ethel, then turning to Ri>se said, "I
wonder who it is?" Just then the visi
tor was ushered into the room, and who
could it be but the owner of the bob
bing curls, bobbing as usual, but very
meekly now. and she held a bunch of
flowers for Ethel. Ethel held out h^r
hands toward her and Jessie went
quickly to the bedside, saying, "You're
the dearest girl I ever knew. How
could you be so kind and I so unkind?"
Then turning to Rose she said, "I hope
you are not angry?" "Not at all," said
Rose. "I know I should not have spoken
so cross and I'm glad we are all friends
again." Jessie again turned to Ethel
and said, "How could you be so kind?"
Ethel smiled from the depths of the
pillows. "It was mamma. She told
yesterday morning always to return
good for evil, and it just fitted in at
the right time." Jessie turned to the
