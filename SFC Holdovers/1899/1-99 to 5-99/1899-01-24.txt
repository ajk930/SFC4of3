EX-GOVERNOR PACHECO
JOINS THE MAJORITY
The Late Romualdo Pacheco.
OAKLAND, Jan. 23.â Ex-Governor Romualdo Pacheco passed away
at his home, 528 Boulevard Terrace, this city, at 9 o'clock to
night, after nearly four weeks' illness. His death is attributed
to kidney troubles, and he was attended by Dr. Liliencranz. In
the hope that a change might inure to his health, the ex-Gover
nor and his wife, the well-known play writer, a few weeks ago visited
their only child and daughter. Mrs. W. S. Tevis, at Bakersfield. For a
tim. Mr. Pacheco appeared to be rallying, and they returned to their
pretty Oakland home only a week ago last Thursday, Mrs. Tevis accom
panying them. During the past few days the deceased sank steadily
though every comfort was thrown about him. His last hours were
â ful and apparently unattended by pain and suffering. His loving
wife and daughter were by his side at the time of his death.
Mr. Pacheco was born at Santa Harbara, October 31 1831 Hp w- na
educated at home by private tutors and for a time was engaged in
nautical pursuits, but afterward interested himself in agriculture He
was elected to tin- State Legislature in 1853 and in 1855 was chosen as
County Judge. He was in the State Senate in 1857 and 1861 and was
.'â¢^.it.' Treasurer in 1563 and again in the Senate in 1868. In 1871 he" was
ant Governor and became Governor by the election of
rnor Booth t... the United States Senate. He was also elected to the
-fifth Congress, but his seat was successfully contested by p. d
Wigginton. The year following he was again a candidate and held a
seal in the fifty-sixth Congress. He was appointed Minister to Mexico
by President Arthur, where he was very popular and did much to advance
. terests of America in that country.

Tragedy in a Mountain
Cabin.
AGED FERRYMAN FOUND DEAD
JACOB BRAGGER KILLED NEAR.
ANGELS CAMP.
Evidence That the Old Man Was
Murdered as He Slept by Rob
bers in Quest of His
Gold.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANGELS CAMP, Jan. 23.â What ap
pears to have been a murder occurred
at a lonely cabin near Reynolds Ferry,
about eleven miles from this place,
some time last night. The victim was
Jacob Bragger, 72 years of age. He
lived alone and ran a small ferry boat j
across the Stanislaus River, which is
about 200 yards from his cabin. He was
seen several times yesterday by differ
ent persons. Several parties had stopped
at his cabin during the afternoon and
had drank to a greater or less extent.
Bragger had put several of his guests
across the river with the aid of his
small skiff. G. R. Stone, who runs the
Reynolds ferry, about two miles up the
river, was in the vicinity at 4 o'clock.
He says that two men were in the
house with Bragger, and both were the
worse for liquor.
This was the last seen of Bragger
until he was found in his bed dead this
morning by John Wannamaker and
Amizo Morrow. These men came to the
rlver'a brink and called to be put
across. There being no sign of life
around the place. Stone, who was work
ing at placer mining in the vicinity,
took the boat and pulled the men across j
the river. They went directly to the
cabin, and, finding the doors unlocked,
ventured in, to find the corpse.
The news was at once brought to this j
place and Deputy Coroner Prince, ac
companled by an undertaker, started
for the scene. The body was ftmnd ly
ing upon the bed in a side room, garbed
in a nightn.be and with several marks
upon the head, wrist and knee. The
house was in an orderly condition and
nothing appeared to have been dis
turbed, bo at the first glance robbery
was not supposed to- have taken place.
The effects of the dead man were ex
amined ami many papers of minor im
portance discovered. Some of the wit
nesses state that a pap^r was found
upon which was written something
about finding some money.
On., theory ; s that Bragger had *v=Â»<>n
drinking during the day and had left
the house during the night and stum
bled and fell,, inflicting the wounds
upon the face and head; but after a
careful examination the relative posi
tion of the marks do not bear out this
theory. There was an abrasion upon
the right cheekbone as large as a dol
lar and one immediately above the
right temple and triangular in shape.
Another wound was to be seen directly
in the center and on the top of the
head.
This mark was about two inches in
diameter ami was somewhat discolored.
The wound upon the cheekbone was
not a deep one and might have been
made by a fall, but the one directly
above it, triangular in shape, showed
well-defined lines and was undoubtedly
made by some small instrument. Even
granting that these two wounds were
made in falling, the wound on the top
of the head could not have been made
by a fall. No evidence could be found
that Bragger had even been outside of
thf- house. The ground was soft from
the recent rains, but there were no
footprints.
Bragger's neighbors say he handled
much money and as he had continually
indulged in placer mining in the vicin
ity since the early sixties he undoubted
ly had some gold dust. It is believed
that whoever committed the crime was
familiar with the old man's secret and
got away with the gold without dis
turbing the order of the house.
Bragger was always known as a
harmless old man and no one had ever
seen him drunk. This fact disproves
the theory that he was drunk and fell
while staggering around tho place. He
had a niece In St. Louis, Mo., Minnie
Turner, and another niece in Chicago,
Mrs. Carrie Sherman.
EARL POULETT PASSES
AWAY IN LONDON
An Organ-Grinder Will Claim the
Succession to His Title
and Estates.
LONDON, Jan. 23.â William Henry,
Earl Poulett, died In this city yesterday
in his seventy-second year. It is prob
able that the succession to the title and
estates will be disputed.
The deceased Earl was thrice mar
ried. According to gossip he made a
wager, when a harum-scarum youth
and traveling about, that he would
marry the first woman he met on land
ing in England. Accordingly at Port
Sea, in 1849. he married Miss Elizabeth
Virginia Newman, daughter of a land
port pilot. Within a few months she
gave birth to a son, whose paternity
her husband denied. The couple from
that time lived apart, the wife dying in
August, 1871. The child, who now calls
himself Viscount Hintcm and claims the
succession, has long been living on the
streets of London as an organ grinder
! and his pretensions were always sternly
! repudiated by the deceased Earl.
About six weeks after the death of
! his wife Lord Poulett married Miss
1 Emma Sophia Johnson, who died in
! 1876 without issue surviving. In 1879
ihe married Miss Rosa de Melville,
I daughter of Alfred Hugh de Melville,
I and their son is generally recognized as
the rightful heir.
The long-standing quarrel between
the late Earl Poulett and the organ
grinding Viscount has furnished the
material for many a London sensation.
I Only a month ago the claimant to the
! succession issued an appeal to the pub
i lie to take a philanthropic interest in
i the condition of the poor, among whom
I he lived and earned his living.
Killed by Moldy Raisins.
REDDING, Jan. 22.â Eda Neilson, a
four-year-old girl, died in convulsions in
this city on Saturday evening from hav
ing eaten a quantity of moldy raisins
which had been thrown in the back yard
as worthless.
COMMITTEE OF INVESTIGATION
CHANGES ITS OCCUPATION
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SAC
RAMENTO, Jan. 23. â Under
the immediate direction of
Chairman Cosper and Mr. Mel
lick the Assembly investigating com
mittee to-day resolved itself into a
committee for the protection of Dan
Burns.
The deliberations of the body were a
spectacle worth going some distance to
see, for it is not every day that the or
dinary citizen is afforded the oppor
tunity of witnessing a legislator in the
very act of bowing at the feet of his
lords and masters, rt is no more than
fair to the majority of the members of the
committee to say that they took no more
active part in the proceedings than was
necessary for them to insure for them
selves a near at hand view of the self
abasement with which Chairman Cos
j per and Mr. Mellick acknowledged the
presence of their masters.
The kowtows and the genuflections
were induced by the presence on the
witness stand of such high personages
as William F. Herrin, who had the
pleasure some weeks ago of announcing,
on behalf of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, the Senatorial candidacy of Col
onel D. M. Burns; Major F. McLaugh
lln, who draws a fine distinction be
tween McLaughlin, chairman of the
Republican State Central Committee,
and well-wisher of his party, and Me-
BURNS THREATENS TO
WRECK THE PARTY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO. Jan. 23. â Twenty-eight ballots for
United States Senator have been taken and Dan Burns has gained but two votes to add to the
twenty-four he received on the first ballot. But two men have been found who were willing
to betray their constituents and enter the Burns camp. These are WRIGHT OF ALA
MEDA AND JILSON OF SISKIYOU.
Burns' lieutenants and the Southern Pacific Company now declare that if Burns can
not secure the election he will cause a deadlock and California will be left with but one rep
resentative in the United States Senate for the coming two years. It is to be Burns or
nothing from now on to the end. Attention is called to this threat that \he members of the
Legislature ana the people of the State may see for themselves the kind of loyalty Dan
Burns has for his party. If it will not elevate him to a position he should not have he pro
poses to wreck it.
Laughlin, the personal friend and
political supporter of the man from
Mexico; Moses Gunst, promoter of
horse racing and all forms of gambling,
including that of trying to get a man
with a malodorous record into the
United States Senate; and Colonel
Daniel M. Burns, political boss and pos
sessor of a record that includes arrest
on charges nf embezzlement, conviction
of fraud and the betrayal of the most
sacred trust. It was a notable array,
to be sure, and it taxed the ingenuity
of the brainy Cosper to find suitable
expressions to indicate to all the gen
uineness of his servility.
It may be as well to $tate at this
point as another that Chairman Cosper
is the same person who was, a few days
ago, charged with soliciting, through an
agent, a $6000 bribe from U. S. Grant's
political manager on the pretense that
he had already been offered $6000 to
vote for Burns. The charge still stands
as It was made, save for Cosper's de
nial of its truth. The man who, it is
said, adted as Cospor's agent in the
transaction has been subpenaed to ap
pear as a witness before ( the investi
gating committee, but he has refused
to obey the order and no steps have
been taken to punish him for his dis
obedience. The man of whom the bribe
is said to have been solicited is said to
be suffering from temporary illness at
his hotel here in Sacramento, but no
subpena has been issued for him and
no steps have been taken to secure his
deposition. In the meantime the Burns
touts are claiming Cosper for their very
own and do not forget to count his
name when reckoning up the "colonel's"
strength on the umpty-seventh ballot
for Senator.
The testimony of the witnesses named
may be summed up in a very few
words. Herrin, though favorable to
Colonel Burns, knew that the Southern
Pacific Company had never paid out a
dollar to promote his Senatorial candi
dacy. McLaughlin knew Burns to be
an honorable gentleman and the proper
man for Senator, but was positive that
the State Central Committee was doing
nothing to assist him to the United
States Senate nor was the State pa
tronage being used as a lever to hoist
reluctant legislators into line to vote
for him. Gunst had heard that Burns
contributed liberally to the Republican
campaign fund and was certain he
would honor the American Congress by
his presence in it. Burns, with becom
ing modesty, acknowledged his own
honesty and high purpose, not forget
ting to mention the fact that he had
been forced to become a candidate by
the newspapers. He failed to mention
the fact that he still owes the State
about $30,000 which was stolen through
his office while he was Secretary of
State.
Quite incidentally it was developed,
through questions put members of the
committee who refused to be shut off
by Cosper and Mellick, that Herrin has

HIGH POLITICAL LIGHTS ON THE STAND

a new occupation connected with his
employment by the Southern Pacific
Company. When a man wants to get a
ticket over the company's lines it is the
proper thing to send a note to Herrin,
who in his turn sends a clterk after the
desired thing. The next time Herrin
meets the man for whom the ticket was
secured he collects for the same and
presumably turns the money over to
the company's cashier. These facts
w^re brought out in Herrin's testimony
concprning the issuance by him of two
tickets to Assemblyman Merrill of San
Francisco at the written request of
Dan Burns. Herrin testified that he
compiled with Burns' request for the
tickets, which were from San Fran
cisco to New York. Some days later he
met Burns on the street and collected
from him the price of the tickets, a sum
amounting to about $130. A peculiar
circumstance connected with this trans
action was that Herrin could not for
the life of him remember whether he
made collection from Burns before or
after the fact of the issuance of the
tickets was exposed in the San Fran
cisco newspapers.
Pursuing the inquiry along these
lines the inquisitive commltteeman de
veloped the fact that Speaker Wright
had also applied to Herrin for trans
portation over the lines controlled by
Collis P. Huntington. The request
made by Wright was not denied. Mr.
Herrin gave him a mileage ticket for
which, Herrin added, Wright paid in
greenbacks. In view of the fact that
Wright has not yet returned the $1650
he received from U. S. Grant, through
Milton J. Green, in return for a prom
ise to vote for Grant for Senator, this
payment by him of money to Herrin in
return for a mileage ticket, sticks out
on the face of his recent career like a
clam shell on a mud flat. It is barely
possible that Herrin may have had a
financial dream at the moment he
handed the mileage ticket over to
Wright, but he is so positive he han
dled the actual cash that his statement
may be received as truth without en
dangering Wright's reputation for dis
honesty.
Another view of the circumstance
would be that Wright did not know
where the ticket office of the railroad is
located and that during the course of
his search for it he wandered into Her
rin's office. Having explained his pre
dicament Herrin saw an opportunity to
get some o-f the Grant money Wright
was jingling in his pockets, so he sold
his visitor a mileage ticket on the spot.
This is, of course, mere conjecture, but
if it were true it must have been a
great relief to Herrin to be able to sell a
ticket and receive the pay for it in his
office, thus avoiding the manual labc-r
attached to running about the streets
to collect small sums for tickets issued
by him, as he did in the case of Colonel
Burns.
The witnesses whose names have
been mentioned were not the only ones
who appeared beftrre the investigating
committee to-day. Among others was
U. S. Grant. He told the committee
that all of the funds that had been
expended by him in making his canvass
for United States Senator had passed
through the hands of Milton J. Green,
his political manager, and that he had
no personal knowledge of the manner
In which the money was expended. He
had given the money to Mr. Green from
time to time, with the general instruc
tions that it was to be used in a legiti- j
mate manner. None of the money so
provided had been expended other than
legitimately to his knowledge. He ad
mitted having signed a. check for $750
which he gave to Green to give to How
ard Wright, but he denied any knowl
edge of th% other $900 which Wright
admits having received from Green.
Earlier in the day Dan T. Cole, coiner
of the San Francisco Mint, was put on
the witness stand and asked to tell
what disposition he had made of the
$500 given him by Green to expend in
the interest of Mr. Grant's candidacy,
lie said he had paid $400 of the amount
to Assemblyman Jilson of Siskiyou
County, then a candidate for election
to the Assembly. He declared that he
had exacted no pledge from Jilson. but
that it was understood the money was
to he used in promoting the election of
all the candidates on the State ticket.
The remaining 5100, Cole said, was
spent by him in the payment of rail
road fares and hotel bills.
Mr. Jilson corroborated -what Cole
had said by admitting the receipt of

the sum said to have been paid to him.
He denied, however, having expended
the money to secure l.is own election,
but generously scattered it about the
district in the interest of all of the
candidates on the Republican State
ticket.
The Inability of the sergeant at arms
of the committee to find Assemblyman
Dale handicaped the inquiry into che
charge that Dale had been offered a
bribe of $3000 to vote for Senator Bulla
as his second choice candidate for
United States Senator. Dale was not

JILSON'S MONEY?
A Slight Discrepancy That Makes

Man From Siskiyou.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 23.â Jilson of Siskiyou is
finding that the way of the transgressor
is hard. He tiled a sworn statement of
his election expenses as th* 1 law directs
and in this statement set forth that he
expended during the campaign the sum
of $94 60. He swears that he paid the
Yreka Journal $13, the Daily Reporter
$10, the Etna Advance $5, the Dunsmuir
News $3 and the Crescent City News
$5. He expended $19 for sundrieS. The
rest of the money was expended, ac
cording to the sworn statement filed
in the office of the Secretary of State,
in traveling expenses incurred by him
self in journeys to Montague, Treka
and the fort.
Dan T. Cole of San Francisco went
on the witness stand to-day and testi
fied that he gave Jilson $400 and held
out $100 for himself. This testimony
caused some surprise as to the division
of the money. If the figures had been
reversed, giving $100 to the Assembly
man and $400 to Cole, the division would
not have excited special wonder.
What did Jilson do Avith the $400?
The expenses accounted for only
figure up $94 60. Here is the sum of
$305 40 that ought to be returned to
Grant. It is to he hoped, for the honor
of Siskiyou County, that Jilson will not
be as tardy in settling up as was
Wright of Alameda.
Perhaps Jilsnn figured that th^ speech
seconding the nomination of Grant
would be worth $305 40, but that speech
was never delivered in joint convention.

A. Yes; that lived there and Voted in
those places.
Q. Who was it? % .
A. One of them was a manâ l cannot
just remember his name; I know it as
well as 1 do yours. He works in the Mint
And "then I sent a couple of men up tnat
I do not know to vote and to get men to
vote for the ticket along the lineâ the
legislative ticket as Well; and in he val
ley counties where Frank Ryan was run
ning for Congress. They wanted to go up
there and vote, and 1 told them to go up
there. â  â -.. "
Q. Did you give any money to Mr. Jil
son? '
A. Yes. sir.
Q. Flow much?
A. $400. . ' I
Q. What were the circumstances attend
ing that? â â¢ â  â¢..-.':â¢
A. The circumstances were these* Mr
Jilson came down to the cityâ he is an old
friend 4lf mine, by the way, I used to
know him many years ago in Sierra Coun
âand said he was nominated for the As
sembly. Well, I asked him how his fight
was. He sad he thought it was all right.
I said, "Do you need any money?" He
said: "No, I think not. I think 1 won't
need to make much, of a canvass or
fight." Well, I said, "How is the genera]
ticket up there? How is the head of the
ticketâ the Governor. Well, he. said,
"It's pretty strong Maguire up there."
Well, 1 said, "You better take some mon
ey and use it for the ticketâ for the head
of the ticket and for Judge Van Fleet, who
has a very hard fight, and for the -Rail
road Commissioner; also for the State Sen
atorâState Senator from that district."
Of course, my object was to elect a Re
publican Legislature, so we could elect
for United States Senator a Republican.
That is the fight I wls making.
Q. Was there anything said to Mr. Jil
son about.suppbrUng L". S. Grant for Stn
ator?
j A. Well, I told him that he was a friend
: of rriihe; 'that 'is all." lie' never pledged
himself to vote for anybody, nor 1 did not
ask him to.- . .
Q. Let me seeâ what county is that?
A. Tluit.is Sisklyou.
Q. Do you remember the amount y ou
put into other counties?
A. Oh, I do not know the amount, be
â  I did; not put: in any particular
i amount. 1 sent men up there election
1 time â a day or two before election â to do
a little work. They did not have any mon
j ey. Of course, the other hundred dollars
1 spent traveling around myself, in ex
pensi
Mr. Sanfordâ Did Jilson take the $400?
A. He took the $400.
Mr. Burnettâ As to Mr. Cloughâ have
you a copy of your letter to him.
A. I have not. I did not keep any copy.
Q. Have you Mr. Clough's letter to you?
A. No. s-ir.
y. Mr. Clough, in his testimony, in giv
ing the substance of the letter to you, as
near as he could, said this, which is pre
. sumably according to or from your letter
âthat is from his memory?
A. Tea.
y. "Now if you are in favor of Ulysses
S. Grant for Senator"â this is Judge
; Clough's explanation of your letter, or
rather quoting it from memoryâ "now if
you are in iavor of Ulysses S. Grant for
Senator, you can have whatever amount
you recjuire in order to make your can
vass." Do you remember writing that?
A. That is correct. That is correct.
The chairman â In providing this tnevy
to Mr. Jilson, did you instruct him to use
it in such manner as to pledge anybody's
â  influence for Mr. Grant?
A. Not the least in the world.
Q. What instructions, if any, did you
give him with reference to the use of "the
' money?
A. Well, I just stated. 1 will state it
! again, however. To use the moneyâ of
: course, if he needed a little himself, why,
â¢ he could use it, but, otherwise, he could
â  use the balance of it for the State ti< ket,
as 1 have stated before. Of course, we
did not know then that we were going to
have a landslide in this Staie, and we
Were all interested in elrctinaf our Gover
nor and the ticket; and thf vote shows
up there that it did some good.
Mr. La liaree â Mr. Cole, you say you
i sent some money, or did 1 understand you
to say that you sent some money into Te
hama County?
A. Sent a man there. No; I did not
si nd any money; not a dollar there. I
sent a man.
The chairmanâ That is not clear, Mr.
Cole. You sometimes say you sent a man
and sometimes sent money.
A. I did not send any money by him at
all. I bought him a ticket and sent him
up there.
Mr. Mellickâ Who furnished th^se work
ers with money? They had to have some
thing to live on.
A. I do not know; I did not furnish it.
Q. You just gave them the transporta
tion?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. How was the transportationâ by a
pass?
A. No, sir; ticket.
Q. You haven't any idea who paid them?
A. No. He was a man that was interested
u^ there, you know; lived there and voted
at that place. You know fie lived there.
It was not an outsiderâ it was a voter.
Q. Now, as I understand it. in this case
of Clough, you said, "Now, if you are in
favor of U. S. Grant for Senator, you can
have whatever amount you require in or
der to make your canvass." Now in the
case of Mr. Jilson, you gave him four hun
dred dollars. You made this condition in
the case of Clough. Did you not make
some such condition in the case of Jil
son?
A. No, sir. I told him that I was a
friend of his and would like to see him
elected.
Q. Well, now, it was Grant's money, was
it not?
A. I did not know whether it was or
not.
Â«j. Well, it had come from Milton Green?
A. Yes, sir.
(}. And knowing it was Milton Green's
money â the money that Milton Green gave
youâ you took it and used it to try and
elect, you say, a Railroad Commissioner,
Mr. Edson, up there?
A. Sea, sir.
Q. And these other officers. Was it
given to you for that purpose?
A. Well, it was given to me by Mr.
Green to use for what I thought was best,
and he knew if the ticket was elected and
the money was put into the general elec
tion, that it would help Rim up there as
well.
Q. Then why did you pick out this man
and that man? Why did not you say:
"We will give it to the County Central
Committee, up there, of this county," and
then have it used In that way?
A. Well, I knew this way: I have
known Jilson for many years, and knew
he knew everybody up in that country,
and I thought he was the proper man to
take hold of it and handle the money.
Q. Why did you pick out this man and
that man on the ticket and say, "Help
them?"
A. Because I thought they were the
only men that were in danger. I knew
that Van Fleet had a hard Eight, and the
Governor; I know the balance of the
ticket would be elected, but I was afraid
of our Governor at that time.
Q. Was $500 the total amount that you
got?
A. Total amount. Never another dollar.
Q. You had some hundred dollars to buy
these tickets with?
A. Yes.
Q. After the $400 had been expended?
A. Yes.
Q. You just had $100 to buy these tickets
with?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And you went on a trip with Mr
I Grant, did you not?
A. Yes; that was before that.
Q. Then you must have had money be
fore that, had you not?
A.. No, sir: not ;i dollar.
Q. Did he pay all your expenses?
A. He paid my hotel expensi Â».
Q. Then mrit money was furnished out
side of this $500?
A. It was not furnished at all. I did not
; furnish it.
Q. I mean he paid those bills outside
; of thai.
A. He paid those bills. Tie wanted me
i to takf- him around the State and intro
: duce him, and I did.
Q. What did you do on this trip around?
A. I lust introduced him; that is all I
did.
I Q. Bid you try to pledge a candidate to
! him?
A. I do not tnimv there was any candi
i date in the field at. this time.
Q. Any possible candidates?
A. No; I never saw any candidate or
talked with them about it. But I intro
duced him to the people so they could see
j whether they liked him or not.
Q. Did not you write some similar let
i ter to the one that -nu wrote to Clough,
i to some other candidate?
A. No. sir; not a scratch of a pen.
I Q. You are very certain that you did not
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 24, 1899.
tell Mr. Jilson? Well, did you have an
idea, though, that Mr. Jilson was going
to vote for Grant?
A; Well, I thought he would. I thought
he would myself, because I told him I
thought he was the coming man. I told
him he was a strong man.
Q. What did Jilson tell
you that led you to believe
that he was going to vote
for Mr. Grant?
A. Well, nothing in par
ticular; only that I thought
he would.
Q. Why did you think he
would?
A. Wei!, from his talk.
He never pledged himself to
Mr. Grant. 1 would not ask
him to pledge himself, any
way.
Q. But you thought he
was going to vote for
Grant?
A. I did, yes.
Q. And then you gave him
$400 to use up there?
A. Yes.
Mr. Sanfordâ You would
not have given him that
$400 had you not thought
he would vote for Grant,
or would you?
A. Well, I do not know
about that. Ido not know
as I would. 1 perhaps
would not.
Mr. Mellickâ Then you could not have
been using this money to help or aid all
the ticket, could you?
A. Yes. When he said he did not think
he wanted to make any canvass, and did
not need the money, I said: "Take tho
money out there; it will help you, any
way, and put it in the general light.'
That is what I told him to do.
Q. You say now that if you had not
thought he was a Grant man you would
not have given him that money, and yet
you say that money was given to help the
weak places on the whole ticket?
A. "Well, that is what it was.
Q. How do you reconcile your two state
ments; one that you would not have giv
en it to him to spend if you had not
thought he was a Grant man?
A. I did not say that. Just go back
and see what I Bald.
The reporter read the answer of the wit
ness given before.
Mr. Sanfordâ You say you knew the $400
came from Grant?
A. It came from Green.
Q. You knew Green was manager of
Grant's campaign?
A. Yes; I think so.
Q. You knew this money was to help
legislators favorable to Grant, and you
would not have given it to Jilson had you
not thought that he was for Grant?
A. Well, he could help the Legislature
if he was not for Grant. There was a
Senator running up there that I wanted to
see elected.
Q. It was like when you wrote to
Clough; you told him that if he was fa
vorable to Grant he could have all the
caiwass money he wanted.
A. No; I guess not that. I said I would
assist him; that Is my memory of itâ
not that he could have all the money he
wanted.
Q. All the canvass money. Then he
wrote to you that he did not want any
such money, and then, of course, you did
not send him any of that money?
A. No.
Mr. Burnettâ Did Mr. Jilson ask you
whose money it was that you gave him?
A. He did not.
The chairmanâ lf I remember the rec
ord right. Mr. Cole, your language to
Mr. Clough was that if he was favora
ble to Grant yon would assist him. Am I
right?
A. Yes.
Q. Well, by that meansâ l am right in
the Inference, am I not?â you tried to
learn that he was favorable to Grant be
fore you offered him assistance?
A. Well, I do not know. I told him
that I was for Grant, as I said before;
that I was for Grant and that I would
like to see him elected. And he asked me
what I thought of his candidacy, and I
thought he would make a very strong
candidate.
Q. Well, do you remember the reply
that Mr. Clough made to you by letter?.
A. Well, not altogether.
Q. Have you got the letter?
A. No, sir.
Q. Do you know what become of it?
A. It is in the wastebasket or burned
up, I suppose.
Q. Now will you kindly state to the com
mittee all that you can remember of its
contents?
A. Well, the substance of it was this:
That he was not going to make any can
vass, and if he was he did not want any
assistance; he could use his own money.
Q. Was there any statement in that let
ter with reference to what parties, if any
body, had been pledged to Grant?
A I think there was something of this
kind: That he said that he did not think
it a proper thing to pledge himself any
way. In fact, he did not pledge himself,
nor would not, nor did I ask him to; but
you know that. And I did not, according
to my version of my own letterâ l did not
state that any man was pledged to Grant.
Q When you told him these numbers
of people that would vote for Grant you
did not say that they were pledged?
A. Oh. no, no. Oh, no.
Q Did you use any language from
which he could properly infer that?
A Well I do not know. I told him I
thought there wera forty or fifty men
that were favorable to Grant. Of course,
perhaps Mr. Clough would remember
this" letter better than I do. I know that
what Mr. Clough swears to here is to the
best of his belief. I know him so well
that I know he Is a very honorable, up
right man. , .- ..,
Q You would not seek, then, to modify
any of the statements made by Mr.
Clough concerning this correspondence?
A No â really I do not know ex
actly what it was. I do not
know but what I would. I do
not know exactly what it was. But
I know that Mr. Clough said what he
thought was in that letter. Of course he
cannot remember exactly what is in the
letter any more than I can.
Q. Did you reply to Mr. dough's an
swer?
â¢\. Ye=. sir. T thinkâ no, I do not thifak
I did, either. No. I do not think I did. '
Mr. Sanfordâ Well, in Mr. Clough's let
ter, did he not state that he was surprised
that you tried to bribe him?
A. No, sir.
Q. Did you answer and try to explain !
that it was not a bribe?
A. Oh, no. He knew better than thatâ
he knew better than that. He knew that
I would not try to bribe him. He did not
so state either, did he?
Q. He said that when he got the letter
he was somewhat hot, and replied that
you had known him for thirty-five or
forty years and ought to know that he j
would not accept a bribe.
A. No. And there was no bribe in it. I
have testified that way.
Q. Well, the general run of itâ that he
wrote back to youâ was that he was very |
much surprised; he knew that you would j
not offer him a bribe, but it came so near
that sense, that he would be taking can- !
vacs money, that he replied very warmly j
to you; and that you wrote back to him j
saying that you had not meant a bribe, I
but simply canvass money, if he needed it.
Mr. Melleckâ l think you are mistaken ,
about that, Mr. Sanford. He stated like j
this: That they would talk together as
father and son would talk together, or as ]
brothers would talk together, and he |
never thought of such proposition as Dan ; i
Cole proposing to bribe him,
The chairmanâ He answered your letter
Baying that he was surprised that you >
would ever attempt to bribe him or offer I
any inducements?
A. I would not only not bribe him be- |
cause I had known him so long, but 1 1
would not undertake to bribe anybody.
Q. In any of those efforts on your part i
to asist the legislative or State ticket did
you seek in exchange for your assistance
to pledge anybody in their vote in any
manner?
A. No, sir.
TESTIMONY OF C. M. BELSHAW.
, I
C. M. Belshaw, being duly sworn, tes- I
tiffed as follows:
â  The chairmanâ State your name to the j
committee.
A. C. M. Belshaw. â¢;
Q. Your residence.
A. Antioch, Contra Costa county.
Q. You are an Assemblyman of this .
Legislature?
A. I am.
Q. Do you know R. C. Dale?
A. I do. i
Q. Did you have a conversation with R.
C. Dale 'in the Golden Eagle Hotel in
this city recently, in which the subject- ;
matter of a financial offer for his vote i
was under discussion? M
A. Yes. :
Q. In whose presence did that conversa
tion take place?
A. Well, now, I do not know. I think
he was a stranger to me.
Q. Do you remember whether Captain
Barbour "was present? You know Cap- '
tain Barbour, don't you?
A. Yes, I know him. I don't think he
was; 1 don't remember that he was.
Q. Were there any others than your
self, Mr. Dale and the stranger present?
A. Well, it was right in the lobby of the
Golden Eagle Hotel, very close to the
telegraph office there, right against the
door as you go into the office, and there
were a number or people, I guess, around
there. I did not notice them, though; I
did not notice who they were.
Q. Do you know whether they were
close enough to have heard the conver
sation?
A. Well, I do not know. I guess maybe
they did, because, when I talk about
these things, I generally talk loud
enough so people can hear meâunfortu
nately.
Q.When was that conversation?
A. I think it was Friday or Saturday
last.
Q. You may state it to the committee.
A. I cannot give it word for word. I
forget just exactly how the conversation
started; but, if I remember, Mr. Dale
was complaining to me because I had got
ten him into a position so that he would
have to testify before the committee, and
I told him it was his owu fault, and we
went over the conversation again of his
being influenced by somebody to change
his vote to Mr. Bulla. and he told me that
he did not believe it; that he thought it
wasâ thought it did not amount to any
thing; that it was not true. And I said
to him: "What did you say so for, then?
Why didn't you keep it to yourself? And
if you had kept it to yourselfâ if you had
your opinion of itâ if that was your opin
ion, that it was an idle rumor and was
not true," says I, "you wouldn't have had
to go on the stand, probably." "Well,"
he said, "I didn't say anything about it."
"Well," said I, "yes you did." Said 1:
"You told it to Mr. Crowder and Mr.
Crowder told.it to me, and I went to you
to find out about it." And I further said:
"I wanted to find out if Mr. Bulla was of
fering $3000 for votes, and if he was I
wouldn't vote for him"; and he said that
it nut him in a peculiar position to mix up
a friend in this investigation. I presume
he meant the man who had made the
proposition to him, if there was any prop
ositionâif it amounted to anythingâ
would have to be put on the stand. That
was the way I understood it, and that
was the substance of the conversation at
that time; that he did not think I had
done the right thing in putting him in a
position to be brought before this com
mittee. He further stated there, at that
time, that he did not believe it was true
that there was any money being â he
thought it was an idle rumor, or a josh
maybe, or something of that kind; and he
thought possibly It was, further, stated
to break up Mr. Grant's forces.
Q. In that conversation was the subject
of this rumor a part of i your conversa
tion?
A. Why, it was all of the conversation
principally.
Q. What was there stated as to who
was the person who had made the offer?
A. Well, he merely said that it was a
friend of his; that is all.
Q. Did you understand that It .was one
Copeland, an attorney for the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company?
A. No; I tried to get him to give me the
name some days ago. I went to Mr. Dale
when he first told me of the proposition,
and tried to get him to give me the name;
told him that he was not treating us fair
by not giving the name, and he would not
give the name. But at this specialâ this
particular conversation rather, that we
had on Friday or Saturdayâ he did not
give the name, but merely said that it
was a friend.
Q. Did he ever' give you the name?
A. Never did.
Q. Did you ever learn it through any
other source?
A. I never did, no. I think I read it in
the Times that it was somebody by the
name of Copeland. but of my own knowl
edge I know nothing.
Q. Did he state anything as to the
manner in which any supposed offer was
made?
A. Mr. Dale, you mean?
Q. Yes.
A. No, if I am not mistaken I think he
said it was to be a financial considera
tion. I am not positive about that, but
that is the way I understood it.
Q. Was the amount of the financial con
sideration named?
A. Not at all.
Q. Were any of the conditions under
which the consideration is supposed to
have been offered named?
A. No; I think that Mr. /Dale stated,
when I had the conversation before the
Saturday conversation, that the idea was
that he should vote for Karoos or any
body e'se, to break upâ the Idea that lu>
pave me was that it was to break up
Grant's forces. That is the idea that I
got from conversation with him.
Q. Mr. Dale had been voting for Mr.
Grant, had he?
A. Mr. Dale had been voting for Mr.
Grant, and he was to go t<j- Bulla, I ander
I stood him to sayâ or anybody else. The
idea was to break up Mr. Grant's forces.
Q. Was there anything to the effect that
he was to have $3000 to make Bulla his
second choice?
A. Well, Mr. Dale did not tell me so; no.
Q. He did not?
A. No; I have heard that rumorâ as I
say, I read it in the papers.
; Q. Then your information upon that is
1 the article by Mr. Washburn in the Los
i Angeles Times?
j A. Yes; that is the principal source of
information. I have heard' it, of course,
! rumored aroundâ talked aboutâ that there
I was $311110 offered.
I Q. Have you any other information
than the conversation with Mr. Dale that
you refer to. as to whether an offer of
$3000 was made by Bulla, or anybody else
in his behalf, to make Mr. Bulla the
' second choice of Mr. Dale for United
â  States Senator?
A. I have not.
i Q. Have you stated all that you can re
member of the conversation between you
and Mr. Dale on the occasion referred to?
A. Yes. sir; I think I have. I have re
lated parts of two conversations. One
took placeâ the first took place here in
the Assembly chamber and the last one
was in the Golden Eagle Hotel, and I
think I have stated the substance of the
conversations.
Q. Both of th^m?
A. Both of them, yes. The first one I
tried to get from Mr. Dale the name of
the person who had made the offer to
him; and the last one was a conversa
tion as I have said, in whichâ l think
that he started it by complaining to me
because I put him in a position to have
to come before this committee, and testify.
Mr. Burnettâ How did you come to enter
into conversation with him In the first
place in regard to this matter?
A. Mr. Crowder informed me that im
proper methods were being used by the
Bulla people, and I asked him on whom,
â and he told me Mr. Dale. Then I went
to Mr. Dale to find out.
Q. Did Mr. Dale, in that first conver
sation, state that an offer had been made
himâ a financial offer?
A. That is what I understood him, yes
âthat he was to vote for Mr. Bulla for
a consideration, and he further went en
to sayâ l understood him to say for
Barnes, or Barnes either. And from the
rant of the conversation I gleaned that
they wanted him to break up Mr. Grant's
forcesâ that is. to make a break in Grant's
forces.
Q. What did Mr. Crowder state to you
when he said that improper methods were
being used? Did he make any definite
statement?
A. No; except that the Bulla people
were going to the Grant people and mak
ing improper advances. I was finding
fault with the methods that I thought
Mr. Grant was using as Improper; and
Mr. Crowder told me to the effect that
the Bulla people were doing the same
thing, and I oughtn't to find any fault.
Q. And Mr. Dale was the only one that
Mr. Crowder mentioned in that connec
tion?
A. Yes, sir. Mr. Dale was the only one
that he mentioned.
The chairmanâ Do you remember, Mr.
Belshaw, how you got the impression that
Mr. Dale conveyed to your mind the idea
that the whole thins might be a "josh"?
A. Because he told me so.
Mr. Burnettâ Was that the second con
versation?
A. The second conversation, yes; that
he did not believe it at all. And then I
told him furtherâ l told him: "Well, if
you didn't believe it. what did you say
anything about it for? If you had kept
it to yourself, and thought it was a joke,
why, then, you wouldn't have had to have
gone before the committee â that is, I
would not have said anything." Of course
I wanted to find out if Mr. Bulla was
using those methods.
The chairmanâ Yes, I think you have
stated that. '
A. If he was, why, I wouldn't vote for
him.
Mr. Lardnerâ Mr. Belshaw, who was it
that you understood was to furnish the
improper consideration for Mr. Dale to
break away from Mr. Grant? Was it to
be Mr. Barnes, or Mr. Bulla, or some of
his friends, or was it simply to persuade
him to break away and vote for some
body?
A. Well, I think he distinctly said that
he did not think that Mr. Bulla knew
anything about it. Of course the infer
ence would be, from that, that it would
be, possibly, some of Mr. Bulla's friends,
or some friends of somebody interested.
Q. Did he intimate anything as to Mr.
Burns' friends?
A. No, sir.
Q. He simply intimated that it was to
break up Mr. Grant's forces and vote for
somebody?
A. Yes; that was the idea that I had
âthe idea that I got in the first conver
sation.
The chairmanâ How about the second
conversation?
A. Well, the second conversation was
where he intimated that he did not be
lieve it; that he thought it was an idle
rumor: that he did not think there was
anything-in it.
The committee then adjourned to
meet at 2:30 p. m.
THE AFTERNOON SESSION.
The committee of special investiga
tion met in room 73 of the Capitol, pur
suant to adjournment from the morn
ing session, this afternoon at 2:30
o'clock. Present: Chairman Cosper,
Sanford, La Baree, Burnett, Mellick,
Lardner.
The chairmanâ l want to make a sug
gestion. That is, that we confine this
testimony now very closely to what is
the fact, and not what is rumor, because
we are never going to get through if we

COLONEL PRESTON TESTIFIES.
Colonel E. F. Preston was called as a
witness and sworn, and testified as fol
lows:
The chairmanâ State your name to the
committee, please.
A. E. F. Preston.
Q. Where do you reside?
A. Woodside, San Mateo County.
Q. What is your business?
A. Attorney-at-law.
Q. Do you know Moses Gunst?
A. I do.
Q. Do you know Daniel M. Burns 9
A. I do.
Q. Did you ever have a conversation
with Moses Gunst relative to the use of
money to promote the election of a Uni
ted atates Senator?
A. Yes.
Q. State where and when that conver
sation to<* place.
A. As nearly as I can remember, a day
or two before the first of the yearâpos
sibly on Sunday, the first of the year. I
am not certain about that; I might be
off a week or ten daysâ prior. But I
think it was very nearly the first of the
year, in his store on Kearny street in San
Francisco.
Q. Do you remember the substance of
that conversation?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. You may state it to the committee.
Ohâ firstâ who were present?
A. Nobody.
Q. You were there, and Mr. Gunst?
A. Well, 1 am nobody, and Mr. Gunst
was there. .
Q. Now you may state the substance of
the conversation.
A. Mr. Gunst came from the rear of the
store to the front and spoke to me about
the attacks that The Call was making
upon him. I told him I had nothing
whatever to do with the management of
The Call, and was not responsible tor any
articles that appeared in it. Mr. Gunst
said that it would have to stop. "It
must be stopped." I told him that I had
nothing to do with it; that I was the
attorney for The Call, but was in no
way responsible for any articles that ap
peared, never saw them and had nothing
to do with the policy of the paper. From
that it went to a conversation . on the
Senatorial situation and a discussion of
the availability of the candidates, and
Mr. Gunst said, in discussing Mr. Burns'
availability, that he had spent $19,000 of
his own money in the tight. It made an
impression upon my mind at the time,
because it was in conflict with other
statements that I had heard made on the
street, and left a very peculiar condition
of thought in my mind. That is all.
The chairmanâ You say he spent $19,000
in the fight. Was the nature of the fight
denned? What I mean about that is this,
colonel: Was the light spoken of the
fight for the election of a United States
Senator?
A. Yes; we were talking about the
Senatorial tight.
<4. Had It any bearing at all on the
general ticket?
A. No, sir; not to my mind. The gen
eral ticket was not mentioned. We were
discussing the Senatorship.
The chairmanâ Any questions further,
gentlemen?
Mr. Burnettâ Did he tell you how he
came by that knowledge?
A. No, sir.
Q. Did he speak of any particular place
in which Mr. Burns had spent money?
A. No, Fir.
Q. Did he mention the name o. any can
didate or any member of the Legislature?
A. No, sir. We were discussing the
availability of Mr. Grant and of Mr.
Burns' candidacy and Mr. Burns' claims
to be a Senator. I was opposing Mr.
Burns' position, and knowing Mr. Gunst's
relations with Mr. Burns
(J. What are they?
A. Very close relations. So close that
the California Jockey Club, with which
Mr. Burns is connected, is in rooms in
tho new building which Mr. Gunst has
taken on Kearny street; and anybody who
knows politics in San Francisco knows
that Mr. Burns and Mr. Gunst are close
friends. I don't think either Mr. Burns
or Mr. Gunst disputes that. The conver
sation,in my mind, was predicated on just
the same state of affairs as if I was talk
ing to Mr. Burns myself, so far as .the
relations between the men were con
cernedâl can tell you that I was talking
to a very close, Intimate /rlend of his. He
did not say who had the money that was
spent or to whom it was spent; or any
thing of that sort. He did not say the
"State Central Committee"; but he sim
ply said that he knew that Burns hart
spent $19,000 of his money. And we were
discussing the Senatorial fight.
Q. Did you discuss that matter any
further? That is, the amount?
A. No, sir.
Q. Did not ask him how he knew?
A. No, sir.
Mr. La Baree-That is about all the
conversation wit* him?
A. That is about all the conversation.
That is everything that was said.
-Mr. Mellickâ Hart Colonel Burns' candi
dacy been announced at that time?
A. I think it had; yes. sir. I am quite
certain. I knew of Mr. Burns' candidacy
some time before it wasâ that is, I con
sidered it was a fixed fact in my mind
that he was going -.o be a candidate be
fore the papers took it up, or before Mr.
Burns made a public announcement.
Mr. Burnettâ How did you come to that
impression, Mr. Preston?
A. Talk on the street and things that
were said; common rumors and knowl
edge amongst men who were acquainted
with political affairs. Hearsay, of course.
Q. Do you know of any money or other
valuable considerationâ promise of pat
ronage or otherwiseâ that has been offered
any member of the Legislature in rela
tion to his vote for United States Sena-
A. I do not.
Q. Do you know of any source to which
you can point this committee from which
tney can gala the information?
A. I do not. I wish I ciuld.
The chairmanâ lf there are no further
questions to this witness he will be ex
cused.

to me," "How are you, Mose?" I said

through. * They have fooled me and I am

Mr. Burnettâ Was any money placed at
your disposal during the last campaign
to use for the furthering of the 'cam
paign?
A. No, sir.
Mr. Mellickâ Did you spe any legislators
in Colonel Burns' interest?
A. I did not.
Q. You have not seen any of them in
Colonel Burns' interestâ any of the leg
islators?
A. No. sir.
The chairmanâ lf that Is all to be asked
of this witness he will be excused. You
are excused, Mr. Gunst.
WHAT W. F. HEBKIN KNOWS.
W. F. Herrin, being called to the wit
ness stand and sworn, testified as fol
lows:
The chairman â You may state your
name to the committee.
A. William F. Herrin.
Q. What is your business.
A. I am an attorney.
Q. Where is your residence
A. San Francisco.
Q. Do you know Colonel Burns?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. The Colonel Burns who is a candi-
l_Or>Â«Ca JOm.n'/MnD- OAmk.s BOTH FiOOIE
FOR. An OPENING m
date before this Legislature for United
States Senator?
A. Yes.
Q. Do you know the speaker of the As
sembly. Howard Wright?
A. l'do.
Q. Do you know whether Howard E.
Wright ever applied to you or to any of
your clients for financial assistance in
his race for the Assembly?
A. I know that he never applied to me,
and I have no reason to suppose that he
ever applied to any of my clients.
Q. Did you, or any of your clients, with
your knowledge, ever give financial as
sistance to Howard E. Wrlgnt in his
political race for tne Assembly?
A. No.
Mr. Melllckâ Mr. Chairman, I don"t
think the charge was in connection with
the political race. It just said that he
had gotten JW)O from Mr. Herrin. Now
then, you modify your questions so that
it don'"t reach the case.
The chairmanâ Well. T don't mean to do
that I assure you. But here is the prop
osition: If he got $800 from Mr. Herrin for
any other purpose than the political race,
it is not germane to the subject under
examination. â¢.
Mr. Mellickâ Well, we can bring that out
afterward.
The chairmanâ Possibly. Since the open
ing up of the campaign for the election of
this Legislature, have you or your clients
with your knowledge furnished to How
ard E. Wright any money?
A. I have not, and my client has not in
mv knowledge.
6 When you speak of your client, you
mean the Southern Pacific Company?
A. The Southern Pacific Company.
Q Yes Was any application made to
you by Howard E. Wright for such
money?
A. No, sir.
Q. No sum whatever?
A. Never was discussed between usâ
anything of that sort.
Q. Well Mr. Herrin. have you since the
election of this Legislature furnished a
pass over the Southern Pacific Company
line to any person at the request of any
member of this Legislature?
A. No, sir.
Q. Do you know of such a pass having
been issued by the Southern Pacific Com
pany at the request of any member of
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, JANUARY 24, 1899.
this Legislature, through the influence of
Daniel M. Burns or otherwise?
A. I do not. That is probably the an
swer to the question. But if you are re
ferring to the transportation that was
furnished to some one at the instance of
Assemblyman Merrillâ is that what you
want to know?
Q. That is what I want to know.
A. Well, 1 can tell you all 1 know about
that.
Q. Kindly do that.
A. Some time in December, I think it
wasâ the exact date I cannot place, a
gentleman called at my office and intro
duced himself as Assemblyman Merrill.
I had no acquaintance with him, and that
was the first time I ever saw him. He
wanted transportation' for a friend of
his, and so far as I remember, he only
mentioned one person who wanted to go
Eastâ some one. I think he said, who
lived in Philadelphia; that he was under
obligation to this person, and that he
would like to get transportation. I told
him it could not be furnished; that the
law prohibited the granting of free
transportation to any one who was not
an employe of the company. Then he
wanted to know if I could not get some
reductionâ get a reduced rate; a half
rate, I think, he wanted. I told him
"No." that was equally prohibited and I
could not furnish it. He then went away,
and afterward, I don't remember whether
it was that day or the next, some one
came to me. It was not Mr. Merrill,
probably some clerk in the passenger de
partment or it may have been Mr. Worth
ington, but I don't remember as to that,
and presented a request from Colonel
Burns that two tourist tickets from San
Francisco to I think some point in Penn
sylvania. I think it was Ehiladelphia.
And those tickets, as I understood, were
furnished.
Q. Was this a written request from
Daniel Burns?
A. My impression is that it was simplyâ
it is my recollection that it was simply a
request.
Q. Were those tickets paid for, do you
know?
A. They were.
Q. By whom?
A. By Colonel Burns.
Q. Do you know the consideration to
Colonel Burns for those tickets?
A. I do not.
Q. Did you ever have any talk with
Colonel Burns about it?
A. I met him afterward, and I men
tioned the fact that upon his request I
had furnished these tickets, and that the
priceâ l stated what it wasâ either $132 or
$1"3 for the two, and he paid me for it.
Q. At that time?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Did he say at that time anything
about whose money It was he was pay
ing for those tickets?
A. H# did not. We had no conversation
on that subject.
Q. Do you know Assemblyman Mer
rillâsince that time?
A. 1 saw him to-day here.
Q. Did you ever have any conversation
with him' about it?
A. No, sir. I think I did meet him after
ward, and there was some newspaper dis
cussion about it, and I think I met him
about that time, and he seemed somewhat
disturbed by the newspaper reports and
asked me what I thought about it. 1
told him he seemed to hrrve got some un
pleasant notoriety by trying to help
Borne friends. It was just a casual con
versation. There was no significance
to it.
y. Did he, at that conversation, say
anything to you about any consideration
having been "offered Mr. Burns for his
intercession In the matter?
A. Colonel Burns' name was not men
tioned. It never was mentioned be
tween us.
Q. Do you know anything of any sim
ilar transaction in behalf of any other
member of this Legislature?
A. That is the only transaction of that
kind that I know anything about.
y. Have any other passes or tickets,
paid for by any other persons than the
legislators themselves, to your knowl
edge, been furnished for any other mem
bers of the Legislature?
A. They have not.
Q You know that they have not?
A. To my knowledge no such tickets
have been given.
Q. Those things would pass under your
eye if they were given?
A. Oh, well, they would if it came to
me. Of course, I don't run the passenger
department, but â
y. Well, if any member of the Legisla
ture, for political purposes, desired such
a pass or ticket, would it not pass under
your observation and be submitted to
you?
A. It would very likely be submitted to
meâ yes, I think it would.
Q. You are the attorney for the South-
em Pacific Company?
A. Yes, sir; I have no reason to think
that any pass would be givenâ or ticket
without it was referred to me; anything
of that sort.
Q. That is what I want to know. You
have every reason to believe it would be
submitted to you?
A. Sfea, sir: I have.
Q. You are intimate with Colonel
Burns?
A. I know him very well.
Q. Meet him frequently^
A. Well, not frequently. I probably
meet him every week or so â week or ten
day*.
Q. Do you know anything of his having
expended any money in the promotion of
his candidacy for the United States Sena
torship?
A. 1 do not.
Q. Do you know of his having used
patronage or the promise of patronage to
anybody or of any character in the pro
motion of his candidacy for the United
States Senatnrship?
A. I do notâ
Q. Directly or indirectly?
A. 1 do not.
The chairmanâ Any further questions,
gentlemen?
Mr. Mellickâ Did you or the Southern
Pacific Company give Colonel Burns any
money during the campaign, for campaign
purposes?
A. No, sir.
Q. For helping the legislative ticket?
A. We did not.
Q. Did you have a talk with Speaker
Wrightâ or Mr. Wright before he was
Speakerâ in regard to the candidacy of
Colonel Burns?
A. I don't remember any such conversa
tion. We may have mentioned it casually,
but I don't recollect it. There was no sig
nificance to it in my mind.
Q. Did Speaker W r right call on you in
regard to legislative matters at all
A. I do not think he did.
Q. Did he call on you for any other pur
pose and then talk about legislative mat
ters or the Senatorial question?
A. No, sir, I don't remember any par
ticular discussion I ever had with him
about Senatorial matters or about legis
lative matters. One conversation 1 re
member, when he was thinking of being
I the Speaker. He had someâ told me he
was sure of being elected. It was sort
of a congratulatory conversation.
Q. Did Speaker Wright apply to you,
or to any member of your company, with
in your knowledge, for transportation?
A. At what time?
Q. Since lie has been elected?
A. I think he did apply to me for a mile
age ticket and 1 don't remember the
date, but I think it was since he was
elected.
Q. Did he get it?
A. He did."
Q. And did he pay for it?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. How did he pay for it?
A. In coinâ money.
Q. How did he come to apply to you?
Why did he not get it in the regular way?
A. Well, he asked me for it. I simply
sent one of my clerks down to the pas
senger depot to get it. That is very
often the case that people come to me,
thinking I can get it for them cheaper;
and it is sometimes done in that way.
Q. Did he pay the full price for it
A. He did, yes.
Q. Since his nomination, did Mr. Wright
apply to you for any amount of money
whatever?
A. No, sir.
Q Then this story that he came to you
for $1200 and got $800 is absolutely false?
A. Absolutely untrue.
Q. Did you furnish any other transpor
tation to anybody on the request of Col
onel Burnsâ at the request of Colonel
Burns in connection with any legislator?
A. I have no recollection of any .such
transaction.
The chairman â That has been asked
him, Mr. Mellick. You are only going
over ground that has been completely cov
ered.
Mr Mellickâ One other question. You
say that Colonel Burns paid you for that
ticket- that is, for these tickets that were
given to Merrill's friends. How did he
pay you?
A. Paid me in money. '
Q. Full value?
A. Yes, sir. I remember the money that
he gave me was greenbacksâ a $100 billâ
and I remember of giving him some
change to make it even. I think he gave
mo $140. I gave him the changeâ the dif
ference.
Mr. Burnettâ W'ell, are men who want
ticKets in the habit of coming to you to
get them?
A. Some men are. It is a very peculiar
tning that if any man happens to know
me and wants anything, from shipment of
freight to a ticket or anything else, from
the Southern Pacific Company, he is very
liable to come to see me about it, in
stead of going to the right department.
Q. There has been some talk about
passes. Now, do you issue passes to any
one?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. That is, not employes of the rail
road? i:
A. Oh, I issue to others sometimes. Yes,
passes within the State.
Q. Well, what is the difference between
a passenger ticketâ that is, on the face of
itâ is there any difference on the face
from a passenger ticket. '
A. Yes, sir. . : . 1 â
Q. What is the distinguishing differ
ence? â Â
A. Well, a pass in a form of a pass. It
says: "Pass so and so from such station
to" such station; good until such a time,
and has the signature of some officer to
Q. Distinguished from a ticket?
A. Yes, sir. \ou all. know what a ticket
is. It does not purnort to be a pass, but
says: "Good for one first-class passage,
or something like that.
Q. Well, now, did you, Mr. Herrin. or
the Southern Pacific Railroad, to your
knowledge, contribute anything to the
campaign fund of any political party in
the past campaign?
A. Mr. Crocker made, some contribution
of some amount.
Q. Do you know how much he contrib
uted?
U A. I think it was $7500. That was my
recollection. , ' . .. ;
Q. Do you know to whom he contrib
uted? â¢â¢"' "â  â  * !
A. I don't remember. He contributed
it to some member of the committee, I
suppose; probably Mr. Kilburn.
Q. What committee?
A. Republican.
Q. Did you contribute anything to any
other committee?
A. I do not. remember any other con
tribution. , . , ' Â '
Q. In making contributions to commit
tees, what are you governed by? That
is, if you contributed, to one committee
and not to another, how uo you draw
the distinction? Why do you contribute
to one committee and not to another?
A. I suppose because we are asked by
some one connected with the committee.
Q Do I understand by that, then, that
if representatives of both committees or
all the committees in the State would ask
you for funds that you would advance
them to the committees? % -
A. No. that does not follow. It does
rot follow that we should contribute to
any one if we don't want to.
Q But in a case where, you did not con
tribute, what I wish to ask you is: How
do you draw the distinction? On what
grounds did you contribute to one com
mittee and not to any other?
Mr. Mellickâ l don't think that has any
reference to this, case.
Mr. Burnettâ lt might have some refer
ence
The chairmanâ do not see myself how
it is germane to the subject. Mr. Burnett.
The point at issue is improper influence
used for the' election of United States
Senator, and wo might spend a week in
that kind of examination and j discover
nothing.
Mr. Burnettâ you know of any con
ditions that accompanied that contribu
tion as to how it should be used? ; : â¢
A. No, sir. There were no conditions.
It had no reference. I will sayâ there were
no conditions attached to it. It was a
mere contribution by Mr. Crocker.
Q. It was an individual contribution?
A * Yes
q" Not by the company? Made by Mr.
George Crocker. Do you know if the
company contributed anything to any
campaign fund? ' â r â 
A So far as- I know, it did not. The
only contribution is the one I have spoken
of. * I have given $500 myself, of my own
Q Well the Southern Pacific Railroad
was very much interested in the last cam
paign, was it not?
A Well, you would think so to read
some of the papers. I don't: think it was
losing much sleep. No doubt a good many
of the people that were friendly to that
company were very much interested, but
the company itself was not making any
Q Woll did the organization of the
railroad employes throughout the Stateâ
T understood they Were organized in clubs.
Did that have any reference to it? Wore
they organized for the purpose of elect
ing tho legislative ticket?
\ Well. I did not organize those clubs,
but you can got at the men who did.
(Â» Who were they?
A I don't know who they were. You
can find out. There is Mr. Sanborn. for
one and Mr. Heffron, who lives in this
city I can give you a list of the names
that I have hoard of, bttt I have never
heard it suggested that it had anything
to do with the Senatorial question and I
don't believe It was ever thought of in
that connection. -
Q Well, it was stated, Mr. Herrin, that
you stated to Mr. de Young and Mr.
Spreckela that the candidate of the
Southern Pacific Railroad for United
States Senator was Dan Burns.
A. I never made such a statement as
Q. Their statement to that effect Is not
correct, then?
A It is not true that I told them that
Mr. Burns was the candidate of the cora-
J Q Well now. did you or the Southern
Pacific Railroad with your knowledge ad
vance any money to newspapers through-
Mr. Mellickâ Well, that question is not
n< Mr b Burnettâ Well. I don"t know. It
looks to me like it ia a fair question.
Mr. Mellickâ How Is it a fair question?
What reference has it?
Mr Burnettâ lt might have considerable
reference, for instance in my county down
there fhere was somebody advanced
funds to one newspaper which enabled
them to put In a plant and run out a very
large edition, and it had a good deal of
bearing on the election in that county.
Â«Mr. Mellickâ Well, it would be perfectly
legitimate, I suppose, for Mr. Herrin's
company to give me $500 for the news
paper**
Mr. Burnettâ Then the question arises,
What is the consideration?
Mr Mellickâ But if I had not been an
Assemblyman it would not make any dif
ferenceâbut I never got a cent from any
man or corporation in regard to that busi
ness Now. then, it makes no difference
in the case whatever. It simply probes
In to find out something that you are
anxious to find out in your own county af
fairs. I hear you are not voting for Col
onel Burns.
Mr. BurnettâThe money was put in on
the other side.
Mr. Mellickâl do not see how that has
any reference to the other side?
The chairmanâLet us. have, some regard
to "any important methods used to elect a
United States Senator."
Mr. Mellickâ Did you have any conver-
sation with any member of the Legisla-
ture in regard to the United States Sena-
tor. Have you had any talks with any
members of "the Legislature?
A. Oh. I have discussed that , matter
with some of the members of the Legis-

Q. Arguments of the chances of differ
ent candidates?
A. I made no effort to influence any
member of this Legislature on this ques
tion.
Q. Well, you maintain it Is your right,
as a citizen, to present any arguments
you see fit, that are proper arguments, for
one candidate as against another; do you
not?
A. That is very true: but I am giving
you the facts about what I have done.
Mr. Melllckâ lf any member of the Leg
islature should apply for a pass who
would be the proper officer in your com
pany to get it from?
A. I suppose any one that would grant
it to him would be the proper officer, butâ
W- lou can't put a fellow on now?
A. No. No. I could not tell you any one
that would grant a pass just simply for
the asking.
Q. No; but I want to know this: You say
that you are not the officer that issued
the passes. Well, who is?
A. Well, I countersign passes. That is,
I can issue a pass in that way.
Q. Well, now then, who is the officer
that signs passes regularly?
A - } v ? n \ tnp re are several officers that
uo. I don t know how many officers sign
passes. I think each one of the vice pres
idents can do it, and the president and
secretary; and the superintendents of di
visions, I think, have thenoww, although
I don't know about that. Mr. H. E. Hunt
'>}gton is an assistant to the president-
Mr. Stuhbs is one of the vice presidents
he can issue passes; Mr. Kruttschnitt
the general managerâ l think he is also a
vice president.
Q. If a note should come to any of these
gentlemen from Colonel Burns he would
probably issue transportation the same as
you did for this friend. Assemblyman
Merrill?
A. No, I don't think he would. As I
said before that probably would be re
ferred to me and no action taken on it
without referring it to me.
The chairmanâ While you are on that
lot me interrupt you a moment and then
you may go on with your examination,
Mr. Melliek. Suppose Assemblyman Mel
liek would come to you and ask you for
passes for a friend or two and offered to
pay, would you issue them?
A. Yes.
Mr. Melliekâ Offered to pay for It
Mr. Lardnerâ Did the pay from Colonel
Burns come immediately when the tick
ets were Issued or was it after the Chron
icle article came out?
A. I don't remember when it wasâ a few
days after the transactionâ l think the
first time I met the colonel.
Q. After the Chronicle article came out?
A. I think it was before.
Q. But it was not the day you issued
the tickets?
A. No. I think the tickets were issued
late in the afternoon.
Mr. Mellickâ Do you know of any trans
portation having been issued at the re
quest of Senator Bulla?
A. I know of none.
Q. It is charged in the newspapers that
a great many â and here on the stand by
Mr. Brownâ of Mr. Bulla's friends came
up here, the Inference being, on passes.
Do you know of any of them coming in
that way?
The chairman âDo you know of any
passes having been issued to any of the
friends of Ulysses S. Grant to enable them
to travel in promoting his campaign?
A. I do not.
Q. General Barnes or George A. Knight?
A. I don't recall any case of that kind.
Q. Any case of that kind for any candi
date?
A. No. I have given General Barnes'
clerk transportation two or three times to
go to see the general on business. I do
not know whether he was helping him in
his campaign or not. I give you that for
what it is worth. I think it was simply to
attend to the general"s legal business, and
I say business that he was doing for oar
company.
Q. The general was doing some business
for your company, was he?
A. Yes; he is one of our attorneys.
Q. Well, was that pass in the nature of
a pass to an employe?
A. Yes, it was in that line. He told me
that he had to see the general upon liti
gation that was pending that the company
was interested in. and, of course, I gave
it to him as an employe.
Mr. Mellickâ ls James Copeland an at
torney of the Southern Pacific Company?
A. He is not.
Mr. Burnettâ Mr. Herrin, do you know
that the Southern Pacific promised to
meet the campaign expenses of any can
didate for the Legislature?
A. I know they did not.
Mr. Lardnerâ That any reports in ref
erence to that are false?
A. I can say with respect to that, that
early in the campaign, I think before
these candidates for tfte Senate were nom
inated, I understood from New York that
it was the wish of the management of the
company that the company should not
take a part in the Senatorial fight. I
suppose that came about from applica
tions to General Hubbard, perhaps, or
Mr. Huntington, on the part of candidates
to interest them. Being acquainted with
that wish or desire on the part of these
gentlemen I avoided taking any part in
doing anything concerning legislative
candidates.
Q. You received that communication
from General Hubbard, did you?
A. Yes.
Q. Did Hubbard speak of any one hav-
Ing applied to him for their support?
A. Well, it would not be exactly right
to state to you what communications I
received from General Hubbard except to
sayâas I regard them as confidential, and
also communications, from a client to an
attorneyâl only assume that probably it
did come about in that way. I don't know
it- â >.v,.
. R The chairman-General Hubbard. then,
is a client of yours? .
', A M s >* lr- AVell- he is the vice presl
vent of the company. I regard him as
beln& entirely in the attitude of a client.
Â«â **Â«Â»â¢ " t is on that ground that you
would hesitate to answer? <â¢n â¢r Â«n"
A. Yes I think it would be improper un
der the rule with which all lawyers arc
familiar to state any communication re
ceived by an attorney from a client,
Mr. Sanford-You say that the Southern
Pacific Company did not expend any
T^do^Jt^^' CamPaign?
Q. $7500, then, was given by i*fr. Crock
er?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And the railroad took no part prior
to the Senatorial question?
A. None whatever.
Q. And did the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company take any part in the Sen
atorial question after election?
A. No. sir.
Q. Did you promise Mr. de Young or
Mr. Spreckels, or either of tuem, that you
would give them the support of the rail
road for Senator?
A. I never did.
Q. Or you never endeavored to get that
support for either of them?
A. I have discussed that matter with
Mr. de Young, and I felt friendly to Mr.
de Young; but, as I say. the company
determined not to engage In any of these
fights for the Senatorship.
Q. Then the statement that you had
promised Mr. de Young the support of the
railroad after the election was not true?
The chairman â Mr. Sanford. I call your
attention to the fact that Mr. de Young
is not a candidate before the legislature
at this time, and it seems to me that we
would be going out into the unKnown
fields of speculation if we were to ex
amine concerning Mr. de Young or any
man that might in the future be before
us as a candidate. He is certainly not as
yet.
Mr. Sanfordâ lt might have something
to do with Senatorial methods. Mr. de
Young might have been a candidate for
a while, and if the railroad did not take
any part in the campaign the elec
tion of course it is not necessary that
lacy took no part in the campaign after
the election.
The chairmanâ T think we must confine
you to the candidates who are before the
Legislature. I do not mean to shut off
Mr. Sanford if he has any other ques
tions. I simnly want to confine the inves
tigation to lines that are proper, because
we will have all to do that we can, with
proper examination.
Mr. Mellickâ Once upon a time you had
an interview with Mr. Spreckels and Mr.
de Young with reference to the Senator
ial situation?
A. I believe T did: yes, sir.
Q. Now, then, you were advocating Col
onel Burns, weren't you?
A. No, sir. The reference to Colonel
Burns in that interview came about in
this way: That in the interview both
those gentlemen expressed hostility or un
friendliness to Mr. de Young.
Q. To Mr. de Young?
A. I meant to Mr. Burns, and his name
was mentioned as one of the men that
should be consulted concerning the Sen
atorship or any other party matter.
Q. Are you through?
A. I think I have answered your ques
tion.
Q. Now. then, you have been advocating
Colonel Burns; was this at the sugges
tion of C. P. Huntington or Mr. Hub
bard?
A. I did not advocate Colonel Burns. In
that interview, as I say, we were discuss
ing the advisability of trying to agree
upon some man for the Senate. I sug
gested to these gentlemen that we three
people could not make a Senator â could
not agree upon a Senator; that there were
a great many other people to be taken
into consideration. And to that Mr. de
Young replied that "We." meaning him
self and Mr. Spreckels. "represent public
opinion. We publish the leading Repub
lican newspapers, and we have got a right
to have a controlling voice." And I sug
gested that among the others to be con
sulted would be Colonel Burns; and his
name was mentioned and I think other
names. And they both said they would
not consult him; did not propose to
"reckon with him." I think that was the
expression Mr. de Young used, and when
I saw the opposition to Mr. de Young â
Q. You mean Colonel Burns?
A. Yes; to Colonel Burns. I expressed
a friendly feeling for the colonel; said I
thought he was a very good man and
he had a right to his place in Republican'
politics.
Mr. Mellickâ Well, the point that I am
getting at is this: Did C. P. Huntington
or Mr. Hubbard suggest in any shape or"
form to you the advocating of Colonel
Burns for United States Senator?
A. No, sir.
The chairman â Any further questions of
this witness? If not. he will be excused.
Mr. Hcrrln, you are excused.
major Mclaughlin testifies.
Major Frank McLaughlin being
sworn, testified as follows:
The chairmanâ There Is a rule of this
committee, major, that nobody shall be
called before the committee unless upon
the written statement of the person call-
Ing him as to what he shall swear to.
Now, if you waive that, we will go on. If
you do not, we will put it in writing.
A. I waive it, sir. with pleasure.
Q. State your name to the committee.
A. Frank McLaughlin, miner and mine
owner. My residence Is Oroville.
Q. What relation did you bear to the
work of the Republican party in the last
campaign?
A. I was the chairman of the State Cen
tral Committee.
Q. How much money, if any, did Colonel
D. M. Burns furnish to the campaign fund
of the State Central Committee?
A. I could not tell you the exact
amount. That would have to be found
out from the treasurer, Mr. Paris Kllburn.
I do know that Colonel Burns has con
tributed very liberally to the cause dur
ing this campaign, as he did In 1896, and
all years that I have had knowledge of
politics. I should judge it would be in
tne neighborhood of between $10,000 and
$10, 000. I could not of my own knowledge
give a more exact figure than thnt.
Q. These contributions are usually made
with your knowledge, are they not?
A. As a rule, yes. That is, a gentleman
will call and express a willingness to
subscribe to the funds of the committee,
and I will refer him to Mr. Kilburn.
And, in some cases, the money has been
handed to me direct and by me' handed to
Mr. Kilburn.
Q. In the contribution or contributions
that Colonel Burns has made to the cam
paign fund of the Republican party in the
last campaign were any instructions given
or any preferences shown, that that fund
should be used toward the election of the
Legislative ticket?
A. No, sir. It was to be used, as was tho
policy of the State Republican Central
CÂ« mmittee, for the benefit of the entire
ticket from the head of the ticket down.
Of course, we worked to secure a Repub
lican Legislature, but we were not con
trolled in any way by any man's Sena
torial aspirations.
Q. You know Colonel Burns well, do you
not?
A. Intimately and well, sir.
Q. He has had a large Influence aj)<l
voice in the matter of directing the cours*
of the State Central Committee in the
campaign, has he not?
A. Well, having- the most implicit re
liance in the Colonel's stalwart Republi
canism and his astute knowledge of poli
tics and men, I have at all times con
sulted him freely and have been largely
guided by his advice and counsel.
Q. Do you know, Major McLaughlin, of
any special fund or any fund having been
used by the State Central Committee for
the purpose of promoting the election of
the Legislative ticket distinct from the
general ticket?
A. No, sir.
Q. Do y6u know of Colonel Burns him
self, or any agent of his, having used any
money in the election of the Legislative
ticket as distinct from the general ticket?
A. I do not.
Q. Do you know of Colonel Burns hav
ing used any money or any agent of his
having used any money since the election
for the promotion of the Colonel's candi
dacy for the United States Senate?
A. I do not. And having a very intimate
knowledge of the Colonel's proceedings, I
am prepared to say that he has not, nor
has any agent used money for him in that
way.
Q. Do you know of any instance where
in Colonel Burns, or any agent of his, has
used patronage, or the promise of patron
age, to promote his candidacy?
A. I do not.
Q. Can you point this committee to any
means whereby they may learn of any
use of money or patronage, or promise of
money or patronage, for the promotion of
his candidacy?
A. No, sir.
Q. You are familiar with his methods,
are you not?
A. Quite so.
Q. You are familiar with the men to
whom he intrusts the working out of his
political plans?
A. Yes, sir: he trusts the working out
of his political plans largely -to the good
sense of the entire -Republican party.
Mr. Lardnerâ ls the State Republican
Central Committee taking part in Mr.
Burns' candidacy?
A. In no way, sir. Not as a committee.
Probably as individuals they are.
Q. It is Â«toarged that they have moved
their headquarters here and have taken
an active part in this campaign.
A. It wp.s charged, I believe, by The
Call, although 1 clearly explained the sit
uation, as it was a matter of interest to
me. We are simply following out a pro
gramme that we started in 1896. By ref
erence to The Call ajid Chronicle of that
date, two years ago, you will see that
they then commended and upheld the
maintenance of our headquarters here
during the Legislature. The Republican
headquarters have in no way been used by
Colonel Burns or any other Senatorial
aspirant for office, and they have been
maintained and carried on exactly as they
were in 1896.
Q. There was no Senator elected that
year, was there?
A. Yes, there was. At the time the
headquarters were maintained, just as
they are to-day.
Q. As I understand, then, no Senatorial
candidate has the single support or the
undivided support of the party organiza
tion.
A. As a party organization?
Q. The party organization is not lend
ing itself to the support of any one can
didate?
A. We are doing today just exactly as
we did during the last campaign. We de
termined then to do all that we could to
elect a Republican Legislature of un
pledged members, with the knowledge
that such a Legislature would elect a
proper representative as Senator. As to
the truth of that story, I refer you to
every member of^Seaate and Assembly in
the Legislature nere to-day or elsewhere.
There is no member of the Legislature
that had been approached by me in any
form or shape to the time that Colonel
Burns announced himself as a candidate.
Since that time, individually. I have spok

HERRIN SWEARS HE DIDN'T SPEND A CENT FOR POLITICS.
en to two and no more in behalf of Col
onej Hum*, 'mat is a statement that
can be corroborated In Sacramento to
ii;iy.
i,'. It has been stated that the State or
ganisation was lending Itself to the up
holding uf the chances of some one par
ticular candidate. That 1b the reason I
asked that question. That is really con
â  i mn of their province
A. As it WOUld be.
The chairmanâ] want to extend my ex
amination concerning Colonel Hums to the
other candidates. -->o you know, Major
McLaughlln. of any other candidate than
Daniel Burns, for the United States Ben
tilp.atorship, having used money, or
patronage, or the promise of cither, to
promote hi* Senatorial aspirations, after
Th. election of the Legislature omer
than bus been detailed here before this
committee, and that you have learned by
reference to what has been given in the
ports of evidence before
this committee?
A. Well, you refer now to other Sena
torial aspirations?
Q. Other than Daniel Burns. 1 do not
mean now to go over what we hav<
here and thai you have read In the sten
ographic reports, but any other instance?
A. NO, sir.
Mr Burnettâ Do you know ol any er
fori being made by the use of patronage,
or the promise of patronage, or the threat
to withhold patronage, to influence the
of any member of the Legislature
for United "States Senator?
\. Bimply what you read in the news-
Q Have yen, as chairman of the State
Centra] Committee, any understanding
with Governor Gage in regard to having
a share in the distribution of patronage?
The chairmanâ] think. Mr. Mellick, that
should be confined to whether it shall be
In the promotion of th>- candidacy of
LTticular candidate.
Mr. Mellickâ Hold on. 1 think it will be
all right "You wail until I pet through
then 1 am -willing to have it stricken out
if it is not. all right.
The chairmanâ Go ahead.
A. You mean in connection with the
Senatorial matter?
Mr Mellickâ Ko; In connection with the
distribution of patronage.
\ Well at the conclusion of the cam
paign Governor Gage and myself and
other gentlemen had a meeting, and
we were discussing the patronage coming
to his office, and he there decided that
before making appointments he would
consult with us.
Q. The State Central Committee lead
ers '
A. Well, certain leaders in the Repub
lican party. Hut that, of course, had
no bearing whatever upon the Senatorial
matter.
Q. Now, then, following that right up,
Bi ite Central Committee has got its
headquarters her* 5 , has it not?
A. Yes. sir.
Q. Now, then, it seems that it would
be a proper question to ask if you, as
the head of that committee, are ad
vocating Colonel BOTBS? Now. is not it
fair to infer that you will use your sharo
of that patronage toward helping Colonel
Burns?
A. No. sir. No man who knows me and
my connection with politics would so in
fer. 1 shall use whatever power I shall
have in the matter of patronage for the
: and advantage of my party; not
lor Colonel Burns or any other man.
Mr. Lardner â That would all be in your
party anyway, would it not?
A. I trust :-â >.
The chaJrmanâ En that connection,
major, was there wnything said at that
convention of friends that any portion of
that patronage Bhotold bo used so as to
promot, the candidacy of any candidate
for United States Senator?
A. Absolutely no.
Q. Was the discussion with reference to
the use of patronage in connection with
the question of the United States Sena
torship at all?
A. No. sir.
Mr. Mfllick â Mr. CJroen and Mr. Brown
testified here that th*- reason they did not
put their money in the State Central Com
mittee was because you wer" unfriendly
during the campaign to Mr. Qrant'B can
didacy to the United States Senate. Was
that true?
A. Mr. Green and M.V. Brown ene'eavor
ed, during the time tfiat Mr. Grait was
striving to elect a Legislature frigidly to
himself, to induce me to become his friend
to the extent of takijig him to my home
in Oroville and to Santa Cruz, where I
also have a residence, and introducing
him to people there, and I refused.
I took the ground (hat, fis the chairman
of the State Central Committee it was not
my right to indorse any candidate, and I
held aloof from Mr. Grant as much as I
did from any other candJdi n that
they based the idea that 1 was unfriendly
to Mr. Gram. 1 am tree to admit that
1 was unfriendly in the sense that I did
not at any time regard him as a lit rep
resentative of our State and people, and
that largely actuated me in refusing to
further his cause. But had T even been
a.s friendly to him as to Colonel Burns,
I would have refuse,] to have allied my
self with him at that time. That is the
reason that they judged that J was un
friendly to their candidate. That they
withheld mnney from th.- State < 'entra'l
Committee on that account I do not be
lieve is true, because up to within a we* h
Of the close of the campaign Mr. Grant
had promised a subscription to Mr. Kil
luirn, the treasurer. The statement at
that ttnip was that Mr. Grant was out of
town and he could not reach him, but as
soon as he returned he would in all prob
ability make a contribution to the funds.
Mr. Burnetts-Did he do it?
A. No, sir. To the best of my belief he
has not.
Q. Did not contribute anything to the
campaign?
A. No. sir; not to the State Central
Committee.
Q. Y\ hat effort did they make to secure
your friendship to Grants candidacy?
A. Well, by subsequently stating to me
that Mr. Grant was a proper candidate,
that he was a very able gentleman, that
he had strong influences In the East,
which was one thing that somewhat
turned me against Mr. Grant, because in
one Of my visits to Washington Senator
Klkins and Mr. t'tirrnn asked me to enlist
in his behalf, and I told him that we were
â tent to select our own Senator
without their interference, which was one
of my objections in the first place to Mr
Grant.
Mr. Mellickâ Before the election on No
veirber R had Colonel Burns intimated
t-> you in any way that he would be a
candidate for tho United States Senate?
A. No, sir: ho had not
Q. When did be firs! intimate to you
that bÂ« might ho a candidate?
A. Well, Colonel Hums was Interested
In tho candidacy <>f another gentleman,
and he was so unspeakably repulsive to
m<> that it almost led to a severance of
the friendly relations between the Col
onel ami myself. I declined to have any
thing to do v.ith It, and practically re
from the Heir). Tt was not until the
â¢ 1 himself bream" a candidate-, and
not until he In fact became bitterly and
grossly attacked by these organs, that I
championed bis cause, which was, I be
lieve some time about the first of the
Q. That wrus tho ti m <\ then, that he gave
out tho first intimation that ho would be
a candidate.
,v. I es, of course. It was generally
rumored, but I paid no attention to that,
and i had several talks with the Colonel,
but 1 did not until 1 came to Sacramento
no. pardon me. The day before I came to
Sacramento, at the Palace Hotel. I had a
talk with the Colonel, and he then said
that ho would become a candidate for the
United States Senate: I told him that I
was with him.
" Mr. Burnettâ Did Mr. Green or Mr
Grant at any time, when trying to enlist
your support, speak of having a list of
the members of the Legislature pledged
to Mr. Grant, or having a number of legis
lators?
A Well. I could not assert that posi
tively. Mr. Burnett, hut they led me to
believe that they harl the field; that the
battle was practically nver: that they had
a great many men tied up to tlv-m', and
tlmt it would be decided on the first bal
lot.
Q. Did they state any rooson why they
had these men tied up? On what ground?
It was Mr. Green who spoke to you was
" A. Yes. in the presence of Mr. Grant
,\\e had many conversations on the sub
ject. No, I cannot say that they gave
me any special reason why they depended
on the support of the Assemblymen or
Senators.
Q, Did Mr. Green ever speak of the fact
of having advanced money to these can
didates for the Legislature or having nut
money Into their districts as one reason
why those members would support Mr.
'Grant? ; v:.%>tT-.-,
A. No: he did not.
Q. There wore special reasons why they
should support Mr. Grant? â â  v â â  â  â¢
: A. Simply said that they had them
that they had helped them, and they had.
a sufficient number to elect on the first
ballot. Of course it is easy to see that I
- -Â«*Â»â¢ taken Into any of the circles of
the Grant forces after my declaration.
Mr. Mellickâ l}id you have a conversa
tion with Speaker Wright In regard to the
candidacy of Colonel Burns.
A. No, "I did not. â  ,â -j.
Q So far as you are concerned will the
action of any legislator in reference to
the United States Sena-torship have any
thing- to do with the . distribution of pa
tronage?'
A. Certainly not. Â, ' .. â¢.
Q That is, if a man is voting for Grant,
voting for Bulla, voting- for Barnes, as
against Burns, the State Central Commit
tee, so far as you are concerned, will not
throw patronage as against them?
A Surely not. When the subject of
patronage was under general discussion it
was to have the party benefited and
strengthened by the distribution of such
offices a* are within the gift of the Gov
ernor. It was on these lines that we
were discussing patronage. The Sena
torshlp or any man's ambition for the
Senatorship was not even thought of in
any way, shape or form and would not be
thought of.v&alSfS"
The chairmanâ As a matter of fact. Ma
jor, the wise distribution of patronage
may be so made as to strengthen the
party?
A. That is it exactly.
Q. And the unwise distribution, as to
disrupt it and make it weak; is not that
it?
A. I believe that is undoubtedly cor
rect.
Q. And that was the subject-matter of
that discussion?
A. That was the subject-matter of the
discussion. That is. on that general
policy the conversation "was based.
Q. And in that matter I presume It is
your custom to confer with those who are
of acknowledged ability in the matter of
the conduct of political campaigns.
A. Surely. To the victor belongs the
spoils, and to the best victors the spoils
go.
Q. That Is r good old Democratic doc
trine uf Jackson's.
A. Well, it is a good Republican doc
trine. "We will try and follow it out this
time.
D. M. BURNS AS AN ANGEL.
D. M. Burns, being sworn, testified as
follows:
The chairmanâ Have you been sub
penaed, Colonel?
A. No, sir.
Q. Are you willing to come before the
committee without being subpenaed?
A. -Most assuredly.
Q. Your name is Daniel M. Burns?
A. Yes.
CJ. Where is your residence?
A. San Francisco.
<â>. Are you the Daniel M. Burns who is
a candidate before this Legislature for
election to the United States Senatorship?
A. J am.
Q. Mr. Burns, have you used any money
to influence any legislator in the matter
of the election of United States Senator?
A. 1 have not, sir.
Q. Directly or indirectly?
A. I have not.
Q. Have you used any patronage, or the
promise of patronage, or the threat to
withhold patronage, for the purpose of
influencing the vote of any member of the
!-â  gislature on the question of the United
States Senatorship?
A. I have not.
Q. Have you authorized any agent of
yours to use any money or patronage, or
the promise of money or patronage, or the
withholding of patronage, to influence the
vote of any legislator on the question of
the United States Senatorship?
A. I have not, sir.
<J. How long have you been a candidate
before the Legislature, or before the peo
ple, for the office of United States Sen
ator?
A. I arrived at a conclusion in my own
mind to become a candidate the day after
Christmas. I announced my candidacy on
the 2d of January.
Q. It was testified here, Mr. Burns, by
Mr. Herrin, that at one time he issued
passes to persons whose names he could
not remember, two of them, at your so
licitation, I think, in writing, to trans
port two persons to some point in Penn
sylvania, perhaps Philadelphia, and that
you paid for those passes or tickets, as
the case may be.
Mr. Mellick â They were not passes.
They were tickets.
The chairman â Well, either passes or
tickets.
Mr. Mellickâ And, then, at the request
of some other party.
The chairmanâ Well, I will find out
about that. Do you remember any
such instance as that?
A. I do.
Q. Kindly state to the committee how
you came to do that, and at whose solici
tation, if true, and whether it is true,
state.
A. Mr. Merrill came to me, I think,
abut the 10th of December and stated to
me that there was a man and his wife
in his district who were poor, objects of
charity; that if they remained here they
would become a public charge ; that they
were being supported then by contribu
tions raised in his district; that if ho
could get a reduced rateâ that he had been
to the railroad company to try to pet
a reduced rate to send them back to their
friends, and that he was unable to do so.
He wanted to know if I could not assist
him. I said: "What sort of ticket do they
want?" He replied, "Emigrant." "About
what would it cost?" "well," he said, "I
don't know, but you might be able to get
a charity ticket." I said, "I don't ;hlnk
so." But after dlscttfeslng the matter at
some length 1 wrote to Mr. Herrln, ask
ing him if he would give them tickets and
make the best rates that he could. A few
days after Mr. Herrrin said that under the
State, commerce law they could not issue
passes or could not issue tickets, and that
he had directed these tickets to issue and
I would have to pay for them, and I did.
Q. Do you remember the amount you
paid for them?
A. My recollection now is it was ?132 or
$133, something of that kind.
Q. This was at the solicitation, as 1
understand you, of Assemblyman Mer
rill?
A. Yes.
Q. Of what district?
A Thirty-sixth.
Q. You had had a talk with Mr. Merrill
about it?
Q. Now in that talk that you had with
Assemblyman Merrill in connection with
these tickets, this thing of the couple, was
anything said directly or indirectly con
<â > fning his vote for United States Sena
tor?
A. Not a word, and I will state further
that I never talked with Mr. Merrill
about thÂ« Senatorial question or any
body's candidacy until after the roll call
here In the Legislature and he had vote,!
1..r Mr Grant. 1 saw him that afternoon
and discussed the matter with him, and
he said to me that he had voted on a
pique. I will frankly confess that I ex
pected a? much to have Mr. Merrill's vote
as any other member of the delegation,
and furthermore, I never asked .i single
man to vote for me. Many of them have
volunteered to me that they would sup
port me, but personally I never ha\e
asked any one. I have not been in the
condition to ask any one. because I whs
not a candidate, and. as I have stated be
fore 1 had not made up my own mind
to become a candidate until tne day after
o The 26th of December last?
T Such a thought never entered my
mind at any previous time. It never en
â¢red mv mind until after The Call and
the Chronicle commenced to abuse me.
That put the idea into my head more
th (S n Wefl th the B an S use Â«f the Chronicle and
Call might be considered an improper In
fluence brought to bear upon a candidate
for the United States Senate.
A 1 think it has been a very improper
one' I think it has been an outrageous
Â°cT Well. Colonel, were you Influenced in
any manner in paying for these tickets
for the couple mentioned, by the Sena
torial situation or with the hope of secur
ing the vote of Mr. Merrill for a candidate
for United States Senator?
A Not in the slightest degree.
Q Was there any intimation made by
v<vfi' or hv any. agent of yours with your
autno-ity. thSt you would assist Mr. Mer
rill in securing these tickets for the pur
pose of securing his vote for any candi-
H< No m e U wSeve a r I S n e ?Â»r -.Merrill
came to me in the State Central rooms
We went into the back room and he told
me his story, and I impulsively decided to
iiFRIPt him in the matter. charity?
Q. Purely as a matter of charity?
A. Purely. ...
Q. Not as a business transaction In any
sense?
â  A. No, sir.
Q. lias Mr. Merrill repaid you the
money that you paid for those tickets?
A. He has not. I would not expect it.
Q. Has Mr. Merrill, in consideration of
your having paid for those tickets, direct
ly or Indirectly promised, or given It to
be understood to you, that he will vote
for- you for United States Senator?
A. No, sir.
Q. Has he voted for you?
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 24, 18*19.
A. He has not.
Q. Have you interceded in behalf of any
other friends of any Assemblymen or
Senator of this Legislature by securing
for them tickets or transportation or
passes over the Southern Pacific Compa
ny's lines?
A. I have not.
Q. It has been stated here that Moses
Gunst said in a conversation with Colonel
Preston that you had expended $19,000 in
the Senatorial' fight. Will you kindly state
to this committee what truth there Is in
that statement?
A. Absolutely nothing. There is no truth
in it.
Q. I will ask you this question, Colonel:
In any contribution that you made to the
State Central Committee funds, did you
make any limitation or conditions as to
the use that that money should be put to
with reference to the Senatorial fight?
A. No, sir.
Q. Did you put any money into the
hands of the State Central Committee
that should be used directly in the elec
tion of the members of the Legislature
with the purpose of influencing or con
trolling their votes, or the vote of any one
of them, for any candidate for the United
States Senate?
A. I did not.
Q. Did you put any money, whether to
the State Committee or otherwise, into
the fight of any legislative candidate
with the hope or expectation of influ
encing or controlling their votes for any
candidate for United States Senator?
A. 1 did not.
Q. Do you know. Colonel Burns, of
Charles G. Lamberson of Visalia, Cal.,
having had any use of your money, or
any money that you had any control over.
for the purpose of influencing the vote
of any member of this Legislature for any
candidate for the United States Senate?
A. No, sir. Ido not think 1 know Mr.
Lamberson.
Mr. Burnettâ Did you ever receive any
communication from Mr. Lamberson of
Visalia?
A. No, sir. I may in years past, when
I have been on the State Central Com
mittee, but none within the last couple
of years.
The chairmanâ Mr. Burnett, I want to
at this juncture ask Mr. Lardner to be
come the chairman of this committee,
and ask you to investigate the question
as to whether Mr. Burns or anybody in
his behalf had used any influence by
money, or patronage, or the promise of
money or patronage, or the threat to
withhold patronage, to Influence the vote
of Assemblyman Cosper for any candi
date for United States Senator, and I will
take no further part during that partic
ular part of your deliberations.
Mr. Lardnerâ Consider the statement as
a question, and I will ask for an an
swer, Mr. Burns.
A. I have not.
Q. Do you know of any patronage, or
threats to withhold patronage from Mr.
( losper, having been used to influence his
vote one way or the other?
A. No, sir.
Q. Do you know of any offers having
been made to Mr. Cosper of money to in
fluence his vote one way or the other, as
to the Senatorial aspirants?
A. No, sir, 1 do not.
Mr. Cosperâ Particularly the 56000.
A. No, sir.
Mr. Lnrdnerâ Did you read or hear that
rumor in the paper about an offer hav
ing been made to Mr. Cosper of $6000?
A. Yes. I read it in the papers.
Q. And that Mr. Cosper then went to
a friend of Mr. Grant and said that
should he decline to vote for Mr. Burns
and vote for Mr. Grant, lie wanted the
same consideration given to him?
A. I read that, yes. No truth in it, so
far as 1 know.
Q. Do you know of any offer having
been made to Mr. Cosper of 56000 if he
would vote for you?
A. I do not.
Q. Or any other cum, more or less, than
$tk>oo?
A. I do not.
y. Do you know anything of the truth
or falsity of whether Mr. Cosper wont to
Mr. Qrant's friends or any other candi
date's friends, stating to them that if he
refused the supposed offer to you that he
should receive tin- same compensation if
he went to them?
A. I do not. sir.
Mr. Mellick â Did Mr. Cosper come to
you with a request for any concession,
monetary or political?
A. He did not.
Q. If he would vote for you?
A. He did not, sir.
Q. Did he send to you or any of his
friends come to you with any such re
quest?
A. He did not.
Mr. Lardnerâ Did Mr. Cosper or any
friend of his make any application to you
as to any patronage that might be entire
ly controlled or in the control of those
that you are very friendly with, to In
fluence his vote one way or the other?
A. No. sir.
Q. Or withholding 1 of any advantages or
privileges or favorable legislation that he
might hope to have in the Legislature if
he should vote for you or not?
A. No. sir.
Mr. Mellick â Do you have a political
manager?
A. Well. I have about four or five hun
dred, I think.
Q. I mean a financial agent?
A. No, sir. ,
Q. Who handles any funds whatever for
you?
A. No, sir.
Q. Would you like to have one?
Mr. Burnettâ How much has your cam
paign for the United States Senatorship
cost you?
A. Whatever my hotel bills and hack
hire may be here. I have not settled
them yet, Mr. Burnett. They are gener
ally high enough.
Q. You do not consider that your con
tribution to the State Central Committee
is an expenditure in connection with your
candidacy for United States Senator?
A. Why, certainly not. I have been a
contributor for years to the genera! fund.
Mr. Sanfordâ You say that Assembly
man Merrill has not voted for you?
A. No, sir.
Q. Have you expected his vote, did you
sa v
A. I did. That Is, I had no reason to
expect otherwise. He was rrom my home
and there fs a very warm feeling in San
Francisco for me.
Q. Do you expect his vote In view of
the fact that you had secured this trans
portation?
A. Why, certainly not.
Q. Did he explain to you the reason
why he did not vote for you?
A. Yes.
Q. What were his reasons?
A. He had requested me to get him the
chairmanship of a committee and have
him placed on two or three other com
mittees ami he did not get the committees
and blamed me for it. I explained to him
after he had voted that I never saw the
committee list and did not have the op
portunity. The committees were given
out to the Associated Press before I had
an opportunity of consulting with the
Speaker with relation to them. And he
thought that ho had been overlooked. He
was piqued and angry; and that was the
n .ts.in that he gave me.
The chairmanâ When you are through,
gentlemen. I want to ask a few questions.
I do not think you have probed the mat
ter quite deep enough to satisfy me with
reference to myself, and with your per
mission, Mr. Lardner, I will ask some
further questions.
Mr. Lardnerâ l thought I had asked all
reasonable questions.
The chairmanâ Colonel, I desire to ask
you if anybody representing himself as
coming from me or representing himself
as a friend of mine, has solicited you to
pay any money, or uiw any promise of
money, or use any patronage or promise
of patronage, to influence my vote for any
candidate for United States Senator?
A. They have not.
Q. Has anybody told you that if you
would use any money or patronage in
my behalf, thereby you could get favor
able influence with me for my vote for
you?
A. They have not.
Q. Do you know anything that you can
state to this committee that will point
them to any evidence that they can se
cure in that behalf?
A.. I do not, sir.
Q. Is there any understanding, ex
pressed or implied, open or secret, be
tween yourself and any man that in
fluence will or can be used upon Assem
blyman Cosper whereby his vote can be
obtained for you as candidate for United
States Senator?
A. There is not.
Q. Has there been any such understand
ing since this Legislature met or since the
election of the Legislature?
A. None at all, sir.
Q. Then the story, so far as you know
is absolutely without truth or shadow of
truth?
A. Absolutely without truth or founda
tion in fact. x
Mr. Mellickâ Has any State, county or
other officer placed at your disposal any
patronage to furtMer your aspirationa for
United States Senator?
A. There has not.
Q. Did you have a conversation with
Speaker Wright, at any time, in regard to
the change of his vote from Bulla to your
self?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. What was that conversation?
A. It was, let me see: The first ballot
was on Tuesday, if I remember correctly.
The second ballot on WednesdayâWednes
day afternoon, I think. *
Q. It was right after he changed?
â  A. No, before he changed.
Q. What was that conversation?
A. I told him that I had expected his
vote and. he said to me that there had
been some influences directed against his
voting for me. He said he had been in
vestigating the charges that had been
made against : me by The Call and the
Chronicle and had not made up his mind
that he ought to vote for me until the
afternoon that I had the conversation
with him. He said he thought now that
the charges were disproved in his judg
ment and believed that he would be do
ing right to vote for me.
Q. Did you remind him, or did you Inti
mate to him in any. shape or form, that he
owed the Speakership to you?
A. I did not.
A. I considered that I was a factor in
shape or form? *
A. I consider that I was a factor in
making him Speaker.
Q. And to what extent? V - "â¢ â¢ .-"â¢
A. Well, to a considerable extent. My
friends, who are legislators, supported
him or agreed to support him, when he
was first announced, as a candidate. Mr.
Wright and I were on very friendly terms,
but there was no question of considera
tion in that. It was' merely what course
I might pursue with relation to anything.
Q. At some previous time had you prom
ised to give him your influence toward
the Speakership?
A. At some previous time?
Q. Yes. â¢â¢â¢â¢â â  -â¢:.-'â ;
A. Yes, sir. V "W- -
Q. Will v you state the particulars of
that?
A.Weil, that is all there is to it. I
agreed that I would support him long be
fore the election.
Q. Were there any conditions attached?
A. None whatever. 1 had agreed to
support Howard Wright for Speaker a
considerable time before the election.
Mr. Burnettâ whose request, Mr.
Burns, did you agree?
A. It was after a consultation between
him and myself. He told me that he
wished to be Speaker of the House. Ala
meda County had had a very prominent
candidate for Governor. They failed In
securing the nomination. They have had
no place on the ticketâ on State ticketâ
and I thought it was due to Alameda
County to give them the Speakership. I
said to him: "If your county asks this,
and the Assemblymen from your county
desire it, I â¢will assist you."
Q. Did you state to Mr. Wright at the
time that you spoke to him and told him
that you had expected his â did you
state to him the ground upon which you
had expected that?
A. No, sir. .
Q.Weil, upon what grounds did you
base your expectation?
A. That of friendship. It is very rarely,
Mr. Burnett, that I ask a man the direct
question. I do not believe that I have
any recollection now of asking any one
whether he would support me or not.
There are certain lines of friendship that
I believe would indicate the course they,
would pursue without asking a question.
Mr. Wright and 1 have been on very
friendly terms, and I expected his vote
as much as I expected one from- San
Francisco or any one from San Francisco.
The chairman â Colonel, at the time or
Just prior to the time the Speaker of the
Assembly changed his vote from Bulla
to yourself, was any inducement brought
to bear upon Speaker Wright by way of
money, or the promise of money or pa
tronage, or the promise of patronage, or
by way of a threat of withholding pa
tronage, or withholding of influence upon
any legislation that he might desire, to
induce him to change that vote?
A. No,, sir.
Q. By you or by any agent of yours,
to your knowledge?
A. No. sir; It was a voluntary act on the
part of Mr. Wright. I did not send for Mr.
Wright. He sent for mo and said he wa3
ready to make the change. . I did not seek
him. He sent a message to me.
Mr. Mellickâ He sent, what?
A. A message that he wanted to see me.
The chairman â Are there any further
questions? If not, you will be excused,
Mr. Burns. : "
GRANT AND HIS MONEY.
U. S. Grant Jr., being sworn, testified
as follows:
The chairmanâ You have been eub
penaed. have you?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Your name Is Ulysses S. Grant Jr.?
A. Yes, sir.
y. You reside at San Diego, in this
State?
A. Yes, sir,
Q. How lonK have you resided there?
A. Nine years.
Q. You are the IT. S. Grant Jr. who is a
candidate before this Legislature for their
Buttragea as United States Senator?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. I want to pay to you. in this con
nection, Mr. Grant, that you are called
before this committee largely because it
is thought that you might want to make
a statement to them concerning some
facts that have been brought before us.
Mr. Milton J. Green has said that he was
your flnanciaJ agent for you as a candi
date for United States Senator. That Is
correct, is it?
A. That is right.
Q. You have placed certain funds In his
hands to promote your candidacy?
A. I have, as he called for them.
Q. At the time you placed this money in
his hands to promote your candidacy un
der what Instructions did you place such
funds in his hands?
A. I was directed to Mr. Green by Sen
ator Perkins, who said that Mr. Green
had had considerable experience "In assist
ing in his campaign for Senator, and I
agreed with Mr. Green that I would fur
nish him with any funds that were neces
sary for a legitimate prosecution of the
campaign. I limited it, however, to tnat
extent that it must be entirely legitimate,
and I know Mr. Green well enough to
trust him entirely. I trusted him entirely
and believed that he would not use any
moans for any other purpose than what
were perfectly legitimate.
Q. Tn the distribution of this money so
placed in his hands by you did you give
him and direct him in Its distribution or
did you leave that matter to his judg
ment?
A. Entirely to his judgment.
Q. Do you know as to how or In what
manner those funds were distributed?
A. I only know of one case, where a
gentleman told me that he had been
sp.aking throughout the State for the
general State ticket and that he was
traveling at my expense.
Q. Who was that?
A. Captain Crcssy of Los Angeles.
Q. In any other instance he has been
controlled only by his own judgment and
not by a direction of yours?
A. "Well, in this matter, I had not any
direction to give him on the subiect. I
simply became informed of the matter
by the gentleman speaking to me on the
subject.
Q. Has Mr. Green at any time reported
to you the manner in which he used any
portion of the money that did not meet
with your approval?
A. No; he never has.
Q. Or that you consider improper and
contrary to the instructions that you had
given him that it should be only a legiti
mate use of the money?
A. I must say that he has not reported
to me at any time. I expect him to re
port later.
Q. In the matter of distributing your
money, you did not call on him for re
ports from time to time?
A. Not at all.
Mr. Mellickâ Mr. Grant, you drew a
check to Speaker Howard E. Wright for
$750, did you not, or at his request?
A. I drew a check at the request of Mr.
Green, and whether I drew it to Mr.
Green or to Speaker Wright or to his
man Yeazell, that he speaks of, I do not
know.
Q. What did Mr. Green say to j-ou when
you drew the check?
A. I happened to be sitting in his office
when this letter came, and he handed it
over to let me read it, and having read
it I threw it back on the table again, and
I made no remark whatever.
Q. This letter from Mr. Wright?
A. From Mr. Wright. But I think per
haps it may have been next day that he
suggested that I had better draw him a
check for $750, and I did and left it with
him.
Q. And was that a contribution to Mr.
Wright's campaign fund?
A. Mr. Wright's letter said that he was
very anxious to pay off a friend who had
immediate use for the money; that he did
not owe the money to the man at the
present time, or at least yet, but that he
was very anxious to accommodate him.
He promised to pay it back.
Q. At the time that you drew the check.
did you understand it as a contribution
to Mr. Wright, or was it a loan?
A. No: I considered it a loan.
Q. Has it ever been repaid?
A. It has not.
Q. And what evidence of an indebted
ness do you hold?
A. I think Mr. Green holds some evi
dence, but I do not. The letter was a re
quest to Mr. Green and not to me.
Q. Previous to that you had given $900,
had you not?
A. Xo, sir.
Q. Did you have any knowledge of $900?
A. I had not any knowledge of it what
ever.
Q. Did you draw a check or give money
to any other Assemblyman upon the re
quest of Mr. Green?
A. I did not give this to Mr. Wright,
either. I gave this to Mr. Green, and he
did as he pleased with it, and I did not
give any money to any Assemblyman
whatever.
Q. Did you personally put any money
in any legislative district. I mean con
tribute to any?
A. The only contribution that I made
was for the election of Governor Gage
outside of my contribution to Mr. Green.
Q. That was to the State Central Com
mittee?
A. No; to my county committee.
The cbairmanâ Before you leave that
line of questions about the letter. I want
to ask a question.
Mr. Mellickâ All right.
The chairmanâ You dropped a remark,
I think, that Mr. Mellick did not catch
to the effect that there was in this letter
a promise to repayâ the $750. Am I right
about that?
A. That is my recollection.
Mr, Mellickâ No, I did not catch that.
The chairmanâ But you read the letter?
A. I read the letter. I was reading the
newspapers at the time, and I read the
letter and threw it down on the desk and
went on reading the paper, but it is my
recollection that he promised to pay it
back. 1 thought he promised to pay it
back as soon as he came back to town,
but I did not see him again for a long
time, and of course I did not expect it. I
thought he may have perhaps paid it back
to Mr. Green.
Q. You do not know whether he has
paid it to Mr. Green or not?
A. I see in the paper that he has not
paid it back, but otherwise I know noth
ing about it.
Mr. Mellickâ You expected Mr. Wright
to vote for you, did you not?
A. I hoped he would.
Q. And what was the hope built upon?
A. Well, it was built upon the fact that
I saw him personally at Mr. Green's of
fice and because he was extremely pleas
ant to me personally. He took pains
when he saw me to talk to me and on one
occasion he said that my only competitor
would be Mr. do Young, and that he ex
pected to be pledgedâ to give a pledge to
his constituents before he could get
through the campaign that he wÃuld not
vote for Mr. de Young. Otherwise I had
not any promise from him whatever.
Q. He never gave you any promise of
any kind?
A. None whatever, nor did I ever get a
promise from anybody.
The chairmanâ Did Mr. Green, with your
knowledge and consent, at any time spend
any of your money with the understand
ing that a pledge or promise or under
standing should be entered into with any
ol" the legislative candidates for the As
sembly or the Senate? That in consider
ation of that money they should vote for
you as United States Senator?
A. No, sir.
Q. Did you ever instruct Mr. Green
Other than your instructions that his ex
penditures should be legitimate, that he
should not pledge any person to vote for
you to whom he gave financial aid in your
race?
A. No, I never did.
Q. Well, that is for the purnose of get
ting at the force of your instructions to
Mr. Green. Would you consider it, Mr.
Grant, as being- illegitimate for Mr.
Green to expend your money in such a
way as to obtain from the persons whom
he assisted with it a pledge to vote for
you as United States Senator, if they
were elected?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And then, when you instructed him
that the expenditures of your money
should be legitimate you meant to in
clude the fact that he should not seek'
pledges by the use of your money?
A. Yes, sir.
Mr. Burnettâ Did you instruct him to
pledge any candidate for you?
A. No: I did not. I instructed him to
use only legitimate means in my cam
paign.
Q. What do you mean by legitimate
means?
A. Well, this case that I speak of, where
this gentleman went about the State mak
ing Bepublican talks. I think that was
perfectly legitimate. I think it would be
loeltimate to pay the hack hire of an As
semblyman to take him about on his cam
paign to make speeches. Ido not know
that I ever figured out just what was le
gitimate, but I certainly would not think
it was legitimate to pledge a man in re
turn for any favor I granted him.
Q. If I remember Mr. Green's testimony
correctly, he testified that when he hand
ed you â that you were in his office at San
Francisco when he received this letter
from Mr. Wright asking for a loan of
$750; that he handed the letter to you
and said that it was all right, whereupon
you drew your check for $750. That is
Mr. Green's testimony.
A. Well, that is what I testified to ex
actly, except I did not remember whether
it was the same day or the next day that
he told me that was all right.
Q. The question that I want to ask hero
is what you understood by "All right,"
whe-n Mr. Green said that was all right.
What did you understand? What did that
convey to you ?
A. Well, it was perfectly safe to lend
the man the moneyâ Mr. Wrightâ l had
seen him a good many times. Of course,
I did not know much about his past his
tory, but he looked like a man worth
J750.
Q. How much did your campaign for
United States Senator cost you, Mr.
Grant?
A. I have not figured it out.
Q. Well, in what way did you advance
the money to your agent?
A. By checks.
Q. On what bank?
A. Well, on the First National, I think,
in San Diego.
Q. Well, between what days? Did you
advance him money in any other waV "ex
cept by checks on the First National?
A. I think one day I drew a check on
the First National and got the money
myself and handed it to him, but it was
a check on the First National. That was
a cheek for $200. <
Q. Was that the only check you drew
in that way?
A. It is the only one I recall; yes.
Q. Can you tell the committee approxi
mately how much money you advanced
Mr. Green?
A. No; I cannot.
Q. When do you expect Mr. Green to re
port to you?
A. As soon as ever this campaign is
ovpr; as soon as ever a Senator is elected
one! he will have a chance to rest up a
little bit.
Q. Your hank account, I suppose, would
show the amount that you advanced to
Mr. Green, would It not?
A. Yes. sir.
Q. Well, did you advance any money to
any other agent, say Mr. Brown?
A. I never advanced any money at all,
except to or through Mr. Green. I never
gave Mr. Brown any checks.
Q. Did you keep press copies of your
letters to Mr. Green?
A. No.
Q. Did you preserve any of Mr. Green's
letters to you?
A. Yes, I probably did.
Q. Have you got them at the present
time?
A. I think so.
Q. Will you produce them to this com
mittee?
A. I will have to go to San Diego to get
The chairmanâ Do those letters that you
speak of speak of the manner in which
he shall use the money?
A. No. they do not.
Q Did they have any reference to any
Senator or Assemblyman as to how they
are expected to vote by reason of their
having: been financially assisted?
A. Not at all.
Q To pledge any Assemblyman or Sena
tor'to vote for you upon any other ground
than the reasons of your fitness for the
United States Senatorship?
A I have never asked anybody to pledge
any member of either house on my ac
count whatever.
Mr. Burnettâ Did Mr. Green ever sub
mit to you a list of members of the Leg
islature whom he expected, or whom he
said, were pledged to vote for you?
A. No, sir.
Mr. Meliickâ Did Mr. Brown?
A. No, sir.
Q. Or anybody else?
A. No, sir.
Q. Did you see a signed list that pur
ported to be by legislators that were
pledged to you?
A. I did not; no.
Mr. Burnettâ Well, we would like to
know, Mr. Grant, how much money you
have expended in this campaign?
A. Well, you will have to give me a
chance to find out, then.
The Chairmanâ l really think, as a mat
ter of fact, gentlemen of the committep,
that the scope of our inquiry ought to be
limited in that respect to such mon< y aa
has been expended to influence the votes
of the legislators for United States Sena
tor; whether it be Mr. Grant or any other
candidateâ simply because if we do not do
that we go into a limitless field of specu
lation that will take up the time and
money of the State and the time of our
selves that should be used in looking after
legislation that we desire, and without
any profit; and it seems to me that we
ought to confine our examination to that
line of inquiry.
Mr. Burnettâ Mr. Green was your polit
ical manager, was he not?
A. Yes, sir.
Q Managed your campaign for the
United States Senate.
A. Yes.
Q. And the money you advanced to Mr.
Green was advanced to him for the pur
pose of advancing your interests in that
direction?
A. Advancing my interests in any way
that he thought was perfectly proper and
right.
Mr. Sanfordâ What did Green receive
for his services?
A. Nothing whatever.
Mr. La Bareeâ Mr. Grant, you spoke of
putting some money into the Republican
committee â I think in Los Angeles
county.
A. San Diego County.
Q. Was that exclusively for Governor
Gage, the head of the ticket, or was it
for the legislative ticket as well?
A. Well. I subscribed so much to the
general fund of the committeeâ to the
treasurer of the County Committeeâ and
when the campaign was over they com
plained that the State Central Committee
had not given thorn any assistance, an<l
that they were still in debt, and 1 made
good whatever was over.
The chairmanâ Do you remember how
much that was?
A. It on.'- amounted to $450.
Mr. Burnettâ You have no idea how
much you advanced to Mr. Green. Was
it $10,000?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Was it $20,000?
A. I will say so.
Q. Was it as much as $30,000?
A. Well, I would ratherâ l don't see
what interest it is to you.
Q. Well, it is of considerable interest to
the State of California.
A. I would rather find out what the
amount was and let you know.
Q. Well, that would certainly bo the
proper course.
Mr. Lardnerâ Was Mr. Green to have
any position if he were successful in his
efforts?
A. None whatever. He made no request.
Mr. Burnettâ One reason why I ask
tfiese questions is: Mr. Green refuses to
state what he did with fhe money. We
have asked him that question and he has
refused to state.
A. I think he paid he refused to state,
because he did not care to mention names
of gentlemen in this connection. It is a
matter of honor with him not to give
away things that were known to him con
fidentially.
Q. If the money was expended legiti
mately I see no reason why he should
refuse to.
A. It certainly has hurt me to have my
name connected with this investigating
committee.
Q. Well, that is not the fault of the in
vestigating committee.
A. Well, in certain particulars.
Q. Every man in filing his statement, or
making a statement as to his expenses for
making a canvassâ every man on this in
vestigation committee, and every man
that is elected to any office in this State
or who is defeated for any office of this
State, is required by law to file a state
ment of expenses, from Governor down,
and he does not consider it any disgrace
whatever. And the inquiry we have made
in regard to the election of United States
Senator I think is perfectly proper as to
his expenses. And all wo asked in refer
ence to those expenses was whether they
were legitimate or not, and I have asked
this question for the simple reason that
the amount of money that has been ad
vanced by Mr. Grant cannot be traced.
We do not know where it went, or how it
was used.
The chairmanâ l do not remember, Mr.
Burnett, that the purity of election law
says anything about United States Sena
tor.
Mr. Burnettâ No, I say everybody but
United States Senator. It is considered
perfectly honorable for the Governor to
file a statement and to make It public
what he has expended, and there is no
reason why it should be dishonorable for
a candidate for United States Senator,
even if he expended $40,000; if he ex
pends it legitimately it is all right.
The witness â These are sort of pre
liminary expenses that you arc inquiring
into now?
Mr. Burnettâ Well, the campaign, as I
understand it.
Mr. Sanfordâ A re you willing to say
what Mr. Green is to get for his work?
You say that Mr. Green has worked for

<Â§> heavy aching, which is sometimes called "Railroad "Back," because it is sP
X usually the result of the jarring of the nerves in the back as the Â®
Â® train jolts along the rails. Mr. J. J. Rockwell, living at 2123 Howard St., Â£

<| Dear Sir: lam willing to testify to the benefit I have received from |>

g fered for several years with lumbago, dizziness, faint and blind spells if

pletely cured me of all my troubles, and I can now make my run with Â®
Â®, the greatest ease and comfort; in fact, have never had a pain or bad Â®
Â® feeling after five days' use of the Belt, and have more life in me than
Â® I have had for years. I always feel better and livelier than those around #

nothing? What promise of patronage or
what is there for him to do that. ?
Mr. Mellickâ l hardly think that Is a
fair question. 'A- , ' "'. â¢* '' "-''
The witnessâ l tt]l you that there is no
promise of that sort. ' .
Mr. Mellickâ No matter what he has
paid Mr. Green; that would not make any
difference to. us.
The chairmanâ Yoi would consider that
it would be perfectly legitimate that
Mr. Green should be properly recompensed
for his services?
Mr. Sanfordâ Certainly.
The chairmanâ Well, then, that does not
enter Into the scope of our inquiry after
all.
Mr. Mellickâ l want to ask Mr. Grant a
question. Mr. Grant, you have been
charged with knifing the State ticket In
the interests of legis.atlve candidates.
\vhat have y ,, u got to say to that?
A. I have to say that that is utterly
ralse.and I :;or Gage knows that
it is false; that he knows that I have al
ways talked in his favor. He has said as
much to me.
Q. Is it not possible that some of the
workers, have done things that you did
not know anything about?
A. Well, the Question has been mooted
so much that 1 have heard more or lesa
talk about it. and I have vet to find one
man who will admit such a thing as thai.
Q. So far as you know, you do not be
li< ye it?
A. I do not believe it at all.
The chairmanâ There is one line of in
quiry that I do not think I wtnt into, and,
I do not remember that any of the mem
bers of the committee. Mr. Grant, have
you or any of your friends at your sug
gestion, with your knowledge or your
Consent, promised any patronage or any
money or threatened to withhold any
patronage, with the purpose to influence
the vote of any legislator of this Legis
lature for United States Senatorâ any
candidate, yourself or any other?
A. No. They have not."
Mr. Sanfordâ -At the time that you drew
the Check of $750 (qr Mr. Wright. if you had
thought that Mr. Wright would not have
Deed favorable to you, would you hava
drawn the check?
A. Tf Mr. Oreen had advised me to do S3
I would have done it.
Q. Are you in the habit of loaning
money promiscuously?
A. No. I have not been very success
ful as a money lender.
Q. If Mr. Wright had not been a can
didate for the Legislature you would
have loaned the $750 to him?
A. I would if Mr. Green had suggested
it : yes.
The chairmanâ Mr. Grant, In that con
nection did you understand this $7.t0 rep
resented by' the check to Mr. Wright,
through Mr. Green or otherwise, was it
your opinion that that money was purely
a loan?
A. Yes. entirely so.
Q. Was it made for the purpose of plac
ing upon Mr. Wright a moral obligation
to vote for you for the United States
Senate"
A. I do not think I thought about It,
particularly. I expected there might be
such a construction put wpnn It.
Q. Did you go any further than to that
extent?
A. That Is all. I never had a promise
from any member of the Assembly or of
the Senate.
Mr. Mvlliekâ Have you anything to vol
unteer?
A. No.
The chairmanâ ls there anything fur
ther? If not Mr. Grant will be excused.

Q. Do you know, Mr. Jilson, of any
money bavins been expended on behalf of
Y. S. Grunt Jr. in your district to aid in
your election.
A. I do not.
Q. Do you desire to make a statement
to this committee concerning the evidence
that has been connected with your name
that was given here?
A. T do.
Q. You may make any such statement
as you desire.
A. I was in San Francisco during the
campaign and met Mr. Cole, as I think I
always do when I go to San Francisco.
Mr. Cole said to me: "I see you havu
the nomination for Assemblyman from
your district." I said: "Yes, it was ten
dered to me unanimously." He said: "Are
you going to canvass the district?" r
said: "No. Not anything to speak of,
anyway." He said: "Do you think that
you will be elected?" I said: "Without
a doubt." He then asked me in regard to
the head of the ticket. I tola him 1
thought Mag-uireâ l was fearful that Ma
uuire would carry the county. He then
asked me what I thought of Mr. Laird's
fight in the Senatorial district. I told him
that I thought he had quite a hard fight.
And he said to me: "You don't want any
money, yourself?" I said: "I do not."
He said: "Don't you think you had betti r
t;ik( some for the general ticket, na.rt*fii

Fleet, for the Railroad Commissioner and

THE INVESTIGATION
Diametrically Opposite Stories Told by
Testifying Politicians.
Burns Has Captured the Committee and Is Work
ing It Greatly to His Advantage and Conse
quent Detriment of his Opponents.
By HENRY JAMES.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA- I
MENTO, Jan. 28.â Not long ago I wrote
that I would not believe a politician un
tth. To-day demonstrated that to
believe them all would be an Impossibil
ity, for they swore and swore, and that
which some of them said could not have
been true, for it directly denied that
which others had said. Yet not a voice
()unvered and not a t'.ice Rushed. I tried
.i- one without prejudice, and stud
ich witness carefully, but to dis
ttitude which disguises a ts
requires a better student of human
nature.
This has been a notable day in the in- .
itlon. To-night the committee is
and the others who had to remain
â¢luring the afternoon are just as tired.
The session was held in a room about
large enough to swing a cat In, and with
as much ventilation as a. safety vault.
People were standing, all save a lucky i
few, and were, jammed bo tightly that
they could not n ach Into tlieir pockets.
The place was hot, and several cigars
- -ttes made the air reek.
Then â  many witnesses that no

backs them to a nicety, there Is surely a I
nigeer in the woodpile; but instead of be

more wood piled on top of him. Each of
these witnesses got In a slap at the news

This was for him rather an unfortunate i

But i pusneÃS of the wickedness

his evidence calmly and smilingly, i
while Grant's confusion was almost piti- j
ful. Nobody suspected tins was because!
Grant was not tolling the truth, either.
I may have be. n Buspected as to i

Belshaw confirmed the story that Dale
told of a monetary consideration for

At the afternoon session Crowder
"niirnv'd the story. Dale and Cope
land air too shy. It is not right that such
a report should be left in the air.
After Crowder, E. F. Preston of San |
Francisco took the stand. He detailed a I
rsation In which he said Gunst had \
that Burns had spent $19,0X1 of his I
own money on the Senatorial campaign. I
ThÂ»y had been talking about the Sena
torial fight and nothing else. Preston did
not hesitate, and part of the time he
looked straight at Gunst, who was chew
ing gum and did not seem to care.
i Jurist also detailed the conversation as
he remembered it. and he was as certain
reston that he did not remember It.
Th<* two accounts agreed in a few par
ticulars of no consequence and in no par

he had spoken of the generous contribu
tions of the colonel to the State Central
BURNS CLAIMS TO BE
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 23.â The Senatorial situa
tion is unchanged. The twenty-eighth
ballot in joint assembly to-day did not
present a single break or variation in
tho line. Burns has not receded from
his programme to call a caucus as soon
as conditions are favorable for obtain
ing the consent ' members to termin
ate the struggle in that fashion. As the
contest progresses the prospect of ad
justment by the caucus plan diminishes.
The followers "f Grant, Bulla and
Barnes are determined to fight the bat
tle in the open. Burns belie^^ that he
holds the key to the situaTtonand has
r. golved to defy the Legislature and the
State. His supporters assert with great
earnestness that *he "'colonel" will win
or prolong the struggle until the time
arrives for the Legislature to adjourn.
Herrin is said to be unyielding and will
stand by Burns until the latter con
sents to retire.
The resentful and defiant attitude of
Burns is provoking indignation among
ervatlve members of the Legisla
ture, who believe that the time, has
come for respecting the sentiments of
the people of California. Whatever the
touts may say among themselves in
secret they put on a confident front in
ih<- open, asserting that Burns' firm
grasp of the situation will compel mem
bers to yield.
There is no let up in the tide of
remonstrance against Hums from the
people at home. The malls and the
wires carry daily messages to Senators
and Assemblymen urging them to fight
Committee as he-had heard that they had
amounted to $14,000 or $15,000, and hts ref
erence had been solely- to this circum-
Stance, lie admitted that his relations!
with Bums wpm intimate, but that the i
latter hÂ»d told him of an intention to be
come a Senatorial Candidate ho explicitly I
denied. Hums, he said, had been driven
into the contest by the abuse of the news- |
papers. I gathered from his remarks j
that on his own acount Gunst did not
love the newspapers much, and he said r
some real mean things about The. Call.
which lias done so much to point out to i
him the way to lead a bettor life. Gunst |
quit munching- the end of his cane and re- j
tired. As no tumult ensued in the hall
probably Preston had left.
There was a whisper and a craning of
neck: as Herrin came forward. Those in
terested in this matter should read his â 
testimony in full. He stated that the
Southern Pacific had done nothing what- j
ever to promote the candidacy of Burns, j
that it was not in politics, anyhow. The
witness told of the application of As- :
semblyman Merrill for passes or special
rates tor an Impecunious pair and of his
refusal to issue them. Later he had is
sued two tourist tickets on the written j
request of Burns, and the next time he ,
had met the colonel Burns had paid him !
for the tickets, Merrill's name not having j
been mentioned in the transaction. Bur-;
nett wanted to know if money had been ,
put Into the newspapers, but Mellick shut !
.>!'f this line of research. Mellick is an j
editor. Then he asked a question which j
got him laughed at. He wanted to know i
If an Assemblyman desired a pass the
proper officer to whom to apply. He is j
still In the dark. The summary of Her
rin's testimony is that the railroad is not
engaged In making Senators, that Green's
statement of Wright having sought finan- j
rial aid was unutterably false, that no j
campaign expenses had been paid, that
James Copeland was not and never had
been a Southern Pacific attorney, and he j
brought it apparently as an incident that I
General Barnes was one of the company's â¢
lawyers and had recently obtained passes
for a clerk. This was a neat attempt to \
create an impression, but 1 doubt its ef
fectiveness. Before he loft the chair he
had denied every allegation which had
been made concerning the interest of the
road in Burns, and he had avoided hurt- I
ing Burns a little bit. He was not rat
tied, and the committee made no attempt
to rattle him. They let him off gently
and soon. They did not jar him with dis- I
turbing questions. Did he not represent
the Southern Pacific and had not that be
nign corporation declared through him '
that it did not care a whoop either way?
When Cosper excused him, it was as
though he was grateful, although a man
who is voting for Bulla cannot logically ;
be glad to have the path smoothed for a
rival.
It was here that Major McLaughlin
projected his sworn eulogy of Burns and
denunciation of De You rip ami snatched i
a few iaurels for his own brow. The ma- j
jor was warm. He declared that Burns
had spent no money since entering tho
contest, or since determining to enter it, ;
and remarks concerning the papers were
thrown In liberally, as the colonel throws '
money into the coffers of the party.
Colonel Burns told the tale of having)
b. en forced into the campaign by the I
wicked pr< ss and how he had not spent a |
cent since his candidacy nor solicited a !
vote. Every intimation that he had vio
lated any tenet of morals, that he had of
fered patronage, money or threats be
quietly denied, never hesitating. He did
not manifest the least excitement, and his j
demeanor contrasted markedly with that |
ni the preceding witness. The longest ex
planation he had to make was of the rail
road tickets he had paid for, and under the
lucid beams he threw upon this it chang
ed to a beautiful charity. He exp<
the support of Merrill, but never from
having extended this favor. He had given
tickets to strangers because the strang
i eded them. At no place did his tes
timony fail to fit that of his witnesses
who had preceded him, the nicety of the ;
tit almost suggesting a rehearsal. It was
also his duty to state that Wright Had
evaded the truth.
In leaving the chair Burns met Grant
and shook his hand. Grant was the last
important witness of the day and had
the most uncomfortable time. His princi- j
pal work was in defending Milton Green,
in whom he expressed the utmost con
fidence. No money he believed had been
illegitimately spent in his behalf. The,
1760 loan to Wright was only for the pur- |
pose of accommodating a friend of
Green. As Burns had done, he denied ,
having sought any pledges or obtained i
any. He has wisned to help the whole;
ticket. Matters were so entirely in the
hands of Green that he did not know
how money had gone, and no accounting- 1
had been "asked for. It was here that
Burnett asked ti.e question as to the to- ]
tal and got up to $20,000, where he struck
a snag. Grant admitted that the inveati- |
gation had harmed him. He charged j
Governor Gag.- of being guilty of an un- '
truth, but he did so mildly. He Is not a
violent man. Indeed, he was suffering ;
under the ordeal, and they let him go.
The day was finished by a statement
from Jllson that be had received $400 from
Dan Cole, but as everybody knows this
it was not really important. So stands
the investigation, its mechanism captured ;
by Burns, and Its position such that a j
vision of whitewash looms up in the near \
future.
The committee did good work at first,
but grew weary in well doing, and in
stead of being a reformative agency has I
been perverted.
Burns to the finish. Burns' managers
care very little what the people think
or say. "The public be damned " is
their motto in this fight.
Reports are brought to the "colonel"
from his friends who went to San
Francisco Saturday evening and re
turned Sunday evening that a large
majority of the business men of the
metropolis flavor the election of Burns.
Reports of this kind are circulated to
brace up the members from th<' coun
try who are giving their support to
Burns.
To-night the friends of Burns claim
that their candidate will be able to get
a caucus before many days. <mo of his
followers said: "The Republicans have
made a mistake in not going into cau
cus. Caucuses are a tradition with the
Republican party and they should be
adhered to. Had they been in the pres
ent instance the dirty linen of the party
would not have been washed in public
to the delectation of the Democrats."
It was further claimed that Burns
had twelve or fifteen votes that would
come to him in secret caucus that he
could not get in the open. The Grant
men repelled caucus overtures as they
suspected that Burns had some mem
bers pledged for secret work who could
not be persuaded to publicly proclaim
their preference for the "colonel."
The talk of the touts about the tra
ditions of the Republican party and the
cool assumption that the party should
be run in the interest of Burns furnish
a sample of the political impudence of
the Burns crowd. It is on a par with
the plea that the "organization" is fur
Burns. Barnes, Bulla, Grant and other
candidates are regarded as interlopers
in the Republican party.
As the facts come to light regarding
the disbursement of money in Bisklyou
County it seems plain that Senator
Laird, who is now voting for Dan
Burns, got some of the Benefits of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, TUESDAY, JANUARY 24, 1899.
Grant money which Dan Cole gave to
Jilson. Siskiyou County is in the Sena
torial district which Laird was elected
to represent. Laird's conduct in voting
for Burns surprises many of his con
stituents.
McLAUGHLIN'S BLUFF
THAT DIDN'T WORK
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Cal., Jan. 23.â Major MeLaugh
lin has evidently been delegated to bring
Assemblyman George Radcliff of Satjj.a
Cruz into the Burns camp if he has to
use a club to do it. He has so far tried
everything from moral suasion to out
and out hold-up, with the only result that
Radcliff is still voting for Grant.
His latest attempt is more far reaching
and decidedly more complex than any
that have come before it. and involves the
Seaside City's hopes of military glory as
well as two or uiree of its public officials.
As was well known to McLaughlin, Rad
cliff came to Sacramento pledged to in
troduce a bill into the Assembly that was
to have for its object the establishment of
a State militia encampment at Santa
i"ruz. The city is the owner of Laveiiga
Heights, a magnificent stretch of Wood
land overlooking Monterey Bay, and this
property it wanted to offer to the State
for military purposes.
It would further agree to lay necessary
water pipes, do the grading, provide light
ing and everything else necessary to a
model camp of instruction. Radcliff was
informed that ex-District Attorney Lind
say would draught the bill. When he
thought it was time for the bill to arrive
be sought out McLaughlin and asked him
how he stood. McLailghlin told him that
until he came to time and voted for the
Mexican candidate he would never get his
bill through the Legislature. It was a
bluff on the Major's part, for It has been
amply demonstrated that all the votes
Burns is controlling is a scant one-third.
He attempted to make it good by calling
Lindsay to this city. Lindsay had the
bill in his pocket when he arrived, but
after arguing with Radcliff and finding
him obdurate he returned to Santa Cruz,
only to return a second time for the same
purpose.
Meanwhile the press of that town got
to asking why Radellff had not produced
his bill, and he wrote bacn. and told the
truth of the matter. The non-politicians
of the town got together and Lindsay
finally yielded to public opinion and the
bill arrived here last night. McLaughlin
was also called down by his townspeople,
and will throw no obstacles in the path
of the measure, which was regularly in
troduced in the Assembly this morning.
WORKS WANTS HIS
FACE PROTECTED
The Young Gentleman From San
Diego is Tired of Being
Caricatured
fAT.L HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 23.â The younger Mr. Works
of San Diego is .right mad. Justly so no
one who knows him will trouble to deny.
It is not that ripping, crimson article that
finds its vent on street signs and one's
wife, hut that gnawing-worm-to-the-soul
sort that finds surcease only under a cof
fin lid or in the courts. This time it looks
like the courts.
Providence, or whoever 'tis makes
faces, gave to the doughty San Diego As
semblyman what is not really an unlovely
countenance; but providence saw fit to
accentuate some lines; set them in italic,
as it were, with a spare or two of minion
and an em dash thrown in here and there
to lend variety. Providence didn't stop
there. It sent Mr. Works to the Legisla
ture.
And he has been caricatured copiously,
gratuitously, and worst of all, exactly.
wherefor this soul blight. It all started
on Saturday when Mr. Works declined to
become one of the Investigating committee,
forsooth, he would be afraid, tie said, to
return to his San Diego home, and law
practice if he were to vote to censure Mr.
Ulysses S. Grant Jr. It was an ingenious
statement for one of Mr. Works' mature
26 years, and was quite popular in the
J louse for some miuutes at' a lot of real
hearty laughter demonstrated. It also
caught The Call's caricaturist, and next
morning he had Mr. Works astride a
velocipede going it at a record breaking
pace for the. sunny orange groves of the
southland, a string of dust and dolls and
other accessories of youth, including short
pants, trailing: along in the rear.
Mr. Works hasn't even looked at the
press desk Bince. He has sat at his desk
In moody silence and knawed his mus
tache, which, in accord with the above
typographical description of his features.
Is set in agate, and it was evident to
every quaking scribe at the desk that his
hot southern blood was engaged in com
ing to a boil. To-day it came. Without
any perceptible effort young Mr. Works
got to his feet. "Mr. Speaker," faltered
he. "a bill."
"Bright boy," muttered the motherly
Mr. Johnson of Sacramento; "he's be
ginning to take notice."
"A bill from air. Works," smiled Speak
er Wright, approvingly. And, Imbued
with the happy spirit of the moment,
clerk Kyle took Mr. Works' offering to
history, and in his best of legislative in
tonation began to drop shudders down the
back! of the occupants of the press desks
just under his voice.
It all came so suddenly that even the
House didn't know just how to take it for
a few minutes. It was the realization of
the dream of Grove Johnson's .ife, but
he didn't know it for some time. Then
he beamed over at Mr. Cosper of Fresno,
formerly of Indiana, and Mr. Cosper
looked deeply sympathetic. <:oui-feet Mel
lick said "Gee, and Judge ('lough tried
to chew the tip of his heard and smile
all at the same time, and every one whose
distorted likeness had ever got him into
a row at home couldn't sit still, and only
the droning of the succeeding bill put
an end to the admiration uiat went out
to the prodigy of the Assembly, whoso
maiden attempt at law making was along
lines they all had feared to walk in.
Here is what it was nil about:
A new section is hereby added to'
the Penal Code, to be known as sec
tion 258, and to read as follows:
It shall be unlawful to publish in
any newspaper, handbill, paper or
serial for publication or supplement
thereto, the portrait or caricature of
any living person, a resident of Cali
fornia, without the consent of such
person first had and obtained; pro
vided, that it shall be lawful to pub
lish the portrait of a person convicted
for crime.
For violation of this section it
shall be a misdemeanor and shall be
punished by a fine of not less than
SI OO or more than $500 or by im
prisonment in the county jail fpr not
less than one month or more than six
months, or by both such fine and im
prisonment.
All persons concerned in said pub
lication, either as owner or manager,
editor or publisher, or engraver, are
each liable for said publication.
In other words Mr. Works is going to
effect immunity from pictured libel by
recourse to the law rather than do bodily
harm to the offending artist. The law
he has introduced is not original. It is
copied from one introduced at the last
session of the New York Legislature, and
there were those at that session unkind
enough to call it a very ordinary type of
"cinch bill."
Whether it was or not It cost the
publishers of New York City in the neigh
borhood of $100,000 to beat it. which they
finally did. Of course coming from Mr.
Works it would be hardly fair to let the
same impression get out with regard to
his pristine effort. Mr. Works is 26 and
quite old enough to appreciate that the
artist, nt least, had his excuse, but it Is
probable that Mr. Works does not want
the fact advertised.

MENTO, Jan. 23. â For some time past
the county officials and more particu
larly those of Alameda County have
been dissatisfied with the county gov
ernment law and last night and to-day
raw an influx of Alameda County offi
cials to this city, all having more or
less of a grievance. They called for a
meeting of the Alameda County dele
gation and went before it this evening
to air their troubles. They do not
know exactly the best way to break
into the law, but have finally decided
to ask for a revision. The major part
of the officials wish more deputies,
while some think the work and com
pensation do not go hand in hand.
WRIGHT'S WHITEWASH
BEING PREPARED
IN TWO CAMPS
Barns and Grant Forces Must Protect
the Speaker (or Their
Own Good.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 23.â Indications to-night
are that the Assembly Committee of
Investigation appointed to inquire Into
the conduct of Speaker Wright and the
corrupt use of money in the Senatorial
struggle will submit a report this week.
The peculiar position of the Senatorial
fight may suggest a union of the Grant
and Burns forces in the task of coating
Wright with a double-thick coat of
whitewash.
The Grant managers may be forced
to take the position that Wright was
justified in accepting money for his
campaign expenses in order to shield
Grant from the stigma of resorting to
bribery. The supporters of Grant have
the greatest contempt for the Speaker,
but in order to protect their leader from
dishonor may be obliged to save the
Speaker from expulsion.
The Burns men have no admiration
for Wright. They know that he took
Grant's money, and according to their
ethics should have "stayed bought."
Wright, however, is ip the Burns camp
and is therefore entitled to the protec
tion of the touts. Should a nroposition
be made to expel the Speaker the Burns
men will be obliged to uphold him. The
Burns following and the Grant mem
bers in the Assembly can control a few
Democratic votes, and so working to
gether will administer the whitewash.
The committee is well advised of the
condition of affairs in the Assembly
and will doubtless submit conclusions
of testimony without any recommen
dation whatever.
THE ASSEMBLY MEETS,
BUT GREEN IS ABSENT
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- j
MENTO, Jan. 23.â Milton Jay Green, po
litical mismanager to U. S. Grant Jr., siill
Buffers from feet frappe. j
Not he but another certificate answered
to his name this afternoon when he was
called to the bar of the Assembly to say
why he should not be punished for con- |
tempt. i
But the thaw has set in and by Wed
nesday Mr. Green's physician thinks the
Green feet will be running all over every
where. But the thaw has set in. The
same certitttcate brought the glad tid
ings that the fever that has surged in
the Green head has bumped up against
the chill in the other extremity and the
one is neutralizing the other. By Wed
nesday, saith me leech, the process will
doubtless be complete and Milton's feet
weU "ti the run.
Mr. Johnson, who made the same mo
tion on Monday, moved again to-day that
two days more be given for the radiator
and compress of Japanese stoves to get in j
tti<ir work. i
Outside of the non-appearance of Mr. \
Green, nothing broke the monotony of the j
day in the Assembly, unless perhaps
when the following rhetorical pyrotech- j
nics went off from the desk of Assembly- |
man Caminettl of Amador:
Whereas, From time Immemorial valorous |
deeds ot defenders ot their country have been
commemorated by grateful nations;
Whereas, The battle at -Manila, decisive as it |
was glorious, crowning alike the American j
navy and the hero under whose leadership it
was 1 1 night ami won, with immortal renown,
entitle! jtear Admiral George Dewey to the
homage of the republic and the gratitude O f
every patriot; therefore, be it
Resolved, By the Assembly, the Senate con
currlng, that the Legislature of the .State of
California respectfully petitions the Congress
of the United States to enact, and the Presi
dent of the I'nited States to approve, a law j
to revive the rank of admiral In the United
States navy, and confer the same on Hear Ad
mlral George Dewey In honor of the distin- ;
gutshed services he has rendered to the re
public.
The display was enjoyed by every one
save- Judge i. 'lough, who got up to say j
that in begged permission u> suggest to '
the Stat'' vi California that it do not try
to run the whole Congress of the United
States. Mr. Caminetti'B resolution was |
consigned to the Committee on Federal ,
Relations.
Assemblyman O'Brien also had some
concurrent resolutions and along the
same radiant line. They read as Allows
and were referred to the Committee on
Federal Relations:
Whereas, An exposition of the products and
industries of the United States, the Hawaiian !
and Philippine Islands and other countries is |
proposed to be held at the city of San Fran- !
cir.co, State of California, beginning May 1,
1901, and continuing to the end of the year;
Whereas, Such exposition, though originally
proposed to commemorate the fiftieth anni
versary of the admission of California into the
Union, will also commemorate the third anni- j
versary of Admiral Dewey*a victory In Manila |
Bayâ the former following the discovery of I
gold Inaugurated a new epoch In history, the
latter opened forever the gates of the oom
raerce of the Eastern world to the United
States;
Whereas, Such an exposition will be national !
in character, gratifying alike the patriotic
pride of the people and their desire to stimu
late our foreign and domestic commerce;
Whereas, The course Of events guided by the i
valor of our soldiers and sailors makes the time !
and place fixed for such exposition propitious j
and our duty imperative to bold the commer
cial advantages sure to accrue to our country
therefrom; therefore, be it
Resolved, FTy the Assembly, the Senate enn
cu#rin(j. that we respectfully urge the President
and the Congress of the Dnited States to make
a Government exhibit at said exposition; that
we further respectfully urgo an appropriation
by the Vnited States in aid of such exposition; ,
that our Senators be requested and our Repre
sentatives in Congress be instructed to use all
honorable means to secure such Government
exhibit anri appropriation; that the Governor
of California bo requested to forward to the
President of the United States, the Senate, and
House if Representatives and our Senators and
members of Congress a certified copy of these
resolutions.
File work and the introduction of hills
required the areater part of the day.
Nothing at all*was done in the morning,
as the joint ballot of course came on at
noon and the House did not convene until
just a quarter before that hour.
Valentine's bill, creating ,i Paris expo
sition hoard and appropriating $150,000 for
exhibit purposes, came up for llnai pas
sage and was again amended by its au
thor so that the appropriation would read
1120,000 instead of 1140,000, and was sent
back to the State printer.
Sanford of Mendocino sent In a reso
lution carrying his resignation from the
Ways and Means Committee and sug
gesting Camlnetti of Amador to replace
him on the committee. The matter w;is
referred to the Committee on Rules
After a long wrangle over bills oti their
third reading, which was finally declared
out of order, adjournment was taken to
the regular hour to-morrow.
TO AVOID A VOTING
MACHINE SCANDAL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 23.â 1f the bill which
Senator Stratton of Oakland will intro
duce in the Senate to-morrow becomes
a law there will be little danger that
this Legislature will leave any voting
machine scandal behind it to make it
odorous in history.
The exposure of the scheme that was
being patched to work a bill through
the present Legislature which would
put thousands of dollars in the pockets
of the owners of the Chrlstensen voting
machine has put the decent element in
the Senate and Assembly on its guard,
and Senator Stratton's bill is designed
to utterly preclude a possibility of the
consummation of the crooked scheme
that was proposed.
Mr. Stratton's proposition la to cre
ate a commission to consist of the Gov
ernor, the Registrar of Voters for San
Francisco and the Attorney General of
State, whose duty it shall be to ex
amine all voting machines presented
for their consideration. To assist them
they are empowered to employ three
mechanical experts, who shall be paid
$10 per day for each day they may be
employed.
The board shall examine every ma
chine brought before it, and in cases
where the inventor may not have suffi
cient funds with which to build a
model the State will stand the expense
if the experts consider that the work
ing plans are feasible. The opinion of
the experts shall be required on every
machine submitted. All machines that
receive the recommendation of the
board will be given a test at the next
general election to decide which is of
greatest practical use, and a report of
the experiment with accompanying rec
ommendations will be submitted by the
board to the next Legislature. The sum
of $25,000 is appropriated to defray the
expense attached to the investigation.
M'LAUGHLIN SPITS
IN GOUCHER'S EYE
Tlie Southerner Withdrew Without
Haking an Attempt to
Retaliate.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 23.â "Mage" McLaughlin
and W. H. Goucher of Los Angeles
came together to-night in the State
Central Committee headquarters at the
Golden Eagle Hotel and Major Mc-
Laughlin spat in Mr. Gouoher's eye.
Mr. Goucher did not retaliate.
The Los Angelano is a political
hanger-on who has infested committee
headquarters ever since his arrival in
town. A day or so ago McLaughlin
heard that Goucher had been giving
tongue to allegations and charges that
did not suit the McLaughlin palate and
the major promptly called him down.
To-day the same report was carried to
McLaughlin and to-night while he was
standing in the committee rooms he
was approached by Goucher. "I un
derstand you're looking for me," quoth
the Southerner. "Not any," replied Mc-
Laughlin, 'and you get out of here as
fast as you can or I'll spit in your eye."
"Well," said Ooucher, "I heard you
were looking for me and I am here
when you want me."
That settled it right there. The
major mustered all the strength of
his lungs, and the loquacious Southern
er backed away from the scene with a
damp handkerchief clamped to a
damper eye "You're a bigger man
than I am, anyway," he muttered.
"Well, I thought you had figured on
that when you came looking for me,"
retorted McLaughlin. "II you haven't
you can go out and get yourself fixed
and I'll meet you anywhere you
choose."
Goucher departed, and up to the
time of going to press had not returned,
heeled or otherwise.
A WARM SESSION
OVER RAILROADS
The Consolidation Measure
Brings Out Much Heated
Argument.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 23.â The Senate Commit
tee on Corporations hart a warm session
this evening over Senate bill 27, which
enables the purchase or lease of rail
road corporations created under the
laws of this or any other State or Ter
ritory or under the laws of the United
States and the consolidation of the rail
roads so purchased or leased under one
corporate name.
Senator Braunhart stated that he
"thanked God Henry T. Gage is the
Governor of the State" and he also said
that he thanked the Almighty that he
was going to protect the interests of the
people. He said that Gage had been
charged with being a Southern Pacilic
tool, but he knew now that he was
not. This came from a Democratic Sen
ator and a strong supporter vi the
Committee of One Hundred.
Captain Sterry, the general solicitor
of the Santa Fe and Pacific road, by
consent stated succinctly the object of
the bill. The Santa Fe and Pacific
road is a Federal corporation and the
bill as originally presented was to en
able its consolidation with two State
corporations. That was absolutely all
there was to the bill.
Senator Braunhart introduced a sub
stitute for the entire bill, which limits
the life of the act which the Santa Fe
Company desires to three years and
adds a provision that nothing con
tained in the act shall be construed as
authorizing or permitting the purchase
or lease by any railroad company of
any competing line of railroad, and
prcrvides further that in the event of
such a sale or lease it shall be unlaw
ful to increase the rates of passenger
fares or freights above those now es
tablished, and in no event shall such
rates be higher tnan the present fares
and freights. Senator Braunhart's sub
stitute bill provides further that noth
ing contained in it authorizes the sale
or lease o-f any railroad to a competing
company. The third clause of the sub
stitute bill provides that the grantee
shall carry out all contracts made by
the grantor in case of sale or lease, and
makes it unlawful for two or more cor
porations to combine ot be jointly inter
ested in any purchase, sale or lease of
any road, whether competitive or other
wise. The penalty for violation of the
act is forfeiture of franchise.
Captain Sterry stated that he would
prefer no legislation to that proposed
by the substitute. Under its terms, if
the Santa Fe Company desired to build
from Mojave around the Tehachapi
STILL THE BALLOT
IS UNCHANGED
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 23.â The smiles of
Barnes, the happy confidence of Bulla and the boastings of the Burns
phalanx, that brought sunlight into Saturday's murky fog and made the
Golden Eagle bar resound to the echo, have all gone for nothing. Mon
day's, ballot is past and the Grant forces arc lined up as solidly as
ever. The advertised break has not come. No one in this mob of can
didates has shed so much as a vote, nor is there promise that any of
them will do so. The molting season has evidently not sot in.
It only required one ballot to demonstrate to-day that others would
be useless. When Jilson failed to answer Barnes to the call of his name,
and Arnerich and Kelsey stayed fast for Burns, and Chynoweth and the
other Grant adherents all yelled Grant, Senator Davis of Amador came
to the fore and said plainly that it was simply a waste of time to sit
there and ballot the afternoon away when committee work was almost
knee deep, and every one agreed with him and adjournment was taken
to to-morrow noon, when another try will be made.
The candidates who have anticipations are apparently not much put
to it that there were no developments. They have the satisfaction of
knowing that for the present if they can't win no one can, and they are
content to play a waiting game.
The ballot of to-day resulted as follows:

Mountain into Los Angeles it would I
have to do it under another corporation I
name, as it would lie a competing line
and could not bo consolidated with the
Santa Fe and Pacific. The captain ex
plained that if it were not for the fact
that the Santa Fe and Pacific were a
Federal corporation no legislation would
lie asked, for a consolidation could be
effected under the present law. All the
Santa Fe was asking was the same
privilege now eiven to California cor
porations.
Senator Morehouse made a flowery
speech against Braunhart's substitute.
He said it would utterly destroy what
it was nought to accomplish. He said
he was in favor of railroads and he was
willing every one should know it. He
talked about demagogues and gave
tht mi a scoring. He said that the
Santa Fe Company asked no subsidy i
but merely the right to consolidate, and j
a San Francisco man wanted to throvr
restrictions around the bill to make it
inoperative. He said California had
sent a lot of demagogues and sand-lot
ters to Congress and that by their ef
forts the fourth section of tbe inter
state commerce law had been enacted,
which cut off from San Francisco the
trade of five States and two Territories.
Senator Doty of Sacramento then
gave to the Southern Pacific Company
the severest drubbing that corporation
has received in a long time. He said
that he spoke as a plain farmer, and
not as a. railroad attorney. He said that
the people here had suffered so severe
ly at the hands of the Southern Pacific
that they preferred a simple farmer in
the Legislature rather than a railroad
attorney, and Sacramento was the head
center of the Southern Pacific. He said
that corporation had taken the cream
out of every industry in the State. He
wanted the people of th n San Joaquin
Valley protected, for they had given
large subsidir-s to ftie competing line
that had been built. The people of the
State had had the very life crushed out
of them until they were restless. He
asserted that the bone and sinew of the
State, the farmers, had been paying
everything they received for their prod
ucts into the Southern Pacific, and they
were tired. He did not propose to he a
party to legislation that would enable
the elimination of competition.
Senator Morehouse made the point
thaÂ£ the Southern Pacific paid out in
Sacramento $270,000 every month.
"Yes, and they take twice that
amount away from us," said Senator
Doty.
Senator Braunhart grew warm In an
swering Morehouse. He resented the
charge that he was A demagogue and
said that he had introduced his sub
stitute for the reason that he thought
there was a Trojan horse in the original
bill.
Senator Shnrtridge pleaded for time to
consider the substitute and it was given
him. The committee will again take up
the bill to-morrow evening.

AFTER TriE SILURIAN MANNER.
AS was to have been expected the first actual step
taken toward the accomplishment of the pro
posed Pacific Exposition has brought the pro
face to face with silurian opposition. From
this time forth until the success of the enterprise is
I, that antagonism will be met at every step
and will have to be combated incessantly.
. experience in opposing progress has taught
the sil : this country that nothing can be
gained by a direct and open hostility to public enter-
Accordingly for some years past they have
!to more cunning tactics. It is their fashion
lien any great project is under way to declare
themselves in favor of progress, but to insist that it
be better attained by dropping the enterprise in
tting about some other.
Thus the opponents of the Nicaragua Canal
boldly object to the construction of a
short water route across the isthmus, but they main
tain it would be better to construct the canal at
Panama than at Nicaragua. The object of such tac
to divide the people and to create differences of
1 that will lead to such wrangling that the
project will be abandoned or at least in
definitely postponed.
These are the tactics which the siiurians of the city
have already adopted in their opposition to the Pa
cific Exposition. The Examiner, which on Sunday
made itself the mouthpiece of that antagonism, an
nounced that it i- in favor of progress and San Fran
cisco enterprise, but is oppoÃed to the project that has
been undertaken. It is in favor of something that
been undertaken, nor is likely to be under
taken. Moreover, it is safe to say that if the sug
-scheme were taken up, the siiurians would then
object to that and propose something else.
There are undoubtedly many ways by which the ex
ire of a million dollars could be made beneficial
to San Francisco. There is hardly any portion of
the city, from the ferry depot to the Cliff House,
where it could not be judiciously expended to the
public advantage. If we are never to undertake any
enterprise until we have reached a condition where
we have no other use for the money, we shall be
gnant as the silurian-. who have achieved their
destiny and are dead.
The promoti rs^of the great exposition are not likely
to be disturbed by this display of opposition. They
are well aware of the truth of Emerson's sn.ying.
"There are two classes of people in the world; one of
which goes ahead and does something and another
.nds around and complains the thing should
have been done some other way."
All expositions have had to meet opposition of the
kind the Examiner has manifested. It is note
worthy, however, that every important exposition in
this country has been successful, and that as soon as
the success was assured the Silurians who opposed it
have been heard to claim a part, and a large part, of
the honor of getting it up. The results in our case
will not be different from those achieved elsewhere.

LOOK FOR A CLEAN MAN.
IT is evident, to quote from our Sacramento cor
respondence, that "the moral sense of the State is
aroused" against the candidacy of Dan Burns.
It is also clear that Ulysses S. Grant occupies a posi
tion scarcely better. The people have demanded
from the Legislature that it cast aside every aspirant
who is tainted and elect a Senator who possesses the
necessary qualifications of intellect, education and
experience, and who is beyond reproach. Such men
Kn easily be found in the ranks of the Republican
party, without discarding some of the gentlemen who
have already been nominated in the joint convention.
The Call has earned the right to pour this demand
into the ears of the members of the Legislature, and
to insist that it be treated with respect and acted upon
with promptness. The State capital is smeared with
the unclean drippings from two of the candidates and
their agents and followers, and with that part of the
Senatorial conflict it is time for the legislative police
to interfere. On behalf of the State, therefore, and
of overy respectable element it contains, we demand
that Burns and Grant be retired and that a clean Re
publican, who will be just to the public as well as
to the railroad, be forthwith chosen as the successor
of Stephen M. White. The Republican party makes
tliis demand. The Democratic party makes this de
mand. The merchants, the manufacturers, the farm
ers, the horticulturists, the miners, the mechanics, the
laborers, the industrious and decent elements of our
population make this demand. It is indorsed by all
political, moral, religious and social organizations
that are interested in maintaining the honor, the repu
tation and the interests of the State. It represents
the American sentiment, transcending parties and
creeds, of a million and a half of inhabitants, who in
struct their elected agents in the Legislature that they
require their intelligence, their integrity, their neces
sities and their wishes, and not corporate selfishness
or the counterfeit shadow of a great name, to be illus
trated by their Senator at Washington.
Throughout the Union the determination to amend
the Federal constitution so that the Senators or the

sentative bodies of other States. Let it now vindi
cate its own independence and manhood and justify
the confidence and heed the admonitions of the mass
cf citizens by whom it was balloted into existence.
LEGISLATIVE INTERVIEWING.
ONE curious feature of such scandals as is now
in course of development at Sacramento con
sists in the efforts of members to adopt
measures which will prevent their recurrence in the
future. Whenever an exposure occurs involving
the reputation of the legislative boodlers, a large
number of back fires are kindled in various directions,
which often take on a very comical complexion.
In 1891 the last days of tile Legislature were about
as exciting, from a scandalous standpoint, as that
which is now in session. On that occasion a num
ber of boodling consultations took place in the State
Library, the rooms of which are very convenient for
meeting and negotiating, being located about half
way between the Senate and Assembly chambers.
Immediately after the last boodle consultation which
took place in the State Library had been exposed, a
member of the Senate arose and offered a resolution
to investigate the State Library! This was an ex
ceedingly comical method of preventing future
scandals.
The other day Senator Boyce of Santa Barbara in
troduced a resolution in the Senate making reporters
who interview members as to their preference upon
bills guilty of contempt. Mr. Boyce's idea evidently
is that the reporters are responsible for the scandals
which are being investigated by the Assembly, and
he thinks that if he can choke off interviewing he will
prevent any future exposures.
We are compelled to differ upon this point with
the honorable Senator. Interviewing is not the
cause of legislative boodling. It is the effect of it.
If the Senators were all honest men and were actuated
by pure motives in legislating for the people there
would be no occasion for the reporters to suspect
them or to investigate their "views' with reference to
pending bills. It is only when the reporters hear
that there is a "sack"' in the lobby which is being dis
tributed among members that they become curious
and insist upon knowing how the members stand.
Nor do we think it will do any good to adopt Mr.
Boyce's resolution. If the Senators decline to be
interviewed matters will be all the worse, for the re
porters will then redouble their efforts to find out how
they stand and will become more suspicious than ever.
The way to stop legislative scandals is to quit bood
ling. No honest legislator was ever accused and no
honest Legislature was ever successfully scandalized.
SAFETY APPLIANCES ON RAILWAYS.
ONE of the most gratifying features of the re
port just submitted by the Interstate Com
merce Commission is the showing made of
the good results obtained from the law requiring rail
way companies to equip their cars and locomotives
with safety appliances. It is a striking illustration of
what can be accomplished by well directed legislation
in the direction of compelling railroad managers to
exercise due care for the lives of their employes.
It appears from the report that the commission
granted numerous railway companies an extension of
two years from January 1, 1898, within which to com
ply with certain sections of the act, and required them
to make semi-annual reports of their progress in
equipping their roads with the safety appliances. Re
turns for the first six months showed tli^t during
that time 119.938 freight cars were equipped with
automatic couplers and 67.400 were fitted with train
brakes, making a total of 795,253, or 69 per cent, hav
ing automatic couplers, and 511,666, or 44 per cent,
equipped with train brakes, up to June 1, 1898. On
that date 29,175, or 90 per cent, of the total number
of locomotives owned by these reporting carriers
were equipped with driving-wheel brakes.
Returns for the six months ending December 1
have not yet been filed, but it is believed they will
show good progress and indicate the probability that
all roads will be fully supplied with automatic couplers
and train brakes on January 1, 1900, when the exten
sion order will expire. Now for the results thus far
obtained. The report says:
"Since the enactment of the law in 1893 there has
been a decreasing number of casualties. There were
1034 fewer employes killed and 4062 fewer injured
during the year ending June 30, 1897, than during the
year ending June 30, 1893. In the Spanish-American
war 298 men were killed and 1645 were wounded. In
1897 there were 1693 men killed and 27.667 injured
from all causes in railway service. In coupling and
uncoupling cars alone 219 less men were killed and
4994 less were injured in 1897 than in 1893. The num
ber of such employes killed has been reduced one
half, and the number of injured also practically re
duced one-half."
The good and beneficent results obtained by the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, JANUARY 24, 1899.
j law have been noted abroad as well as in this country,
and it is stated that application of the self-coupling
device and other safety appliances is now being seri
ously considered in Great Britain, where the ratio of
lives lost to the number of men employed in coupling
and uncoupling cars is reported to be i to 350. The
ratio in this country has been reduced to 1 man killed
out of each 600 employed in coupling and uncoupling
cars.
Rarely has a law so completely vindicated itself as
this. A statute that extends a protecting hand over
the nation and saves the lives of workers is one of
the highest beneficence, and the framers of this act
may well look back upon their work with satisfaction
and an honest pride.
TNE SflMOfiN PROBLEM.
IT is not surprising that the recent flurry in Samoa
has resulted in a revival of the scheme to divide
the group into three parts, giving one each to the
United States, Great Britain and Germany. The ex
periment with the triple combination protectorate has
been unsatisfactory from the start. There have al
ways been dissensions among the commissioners, and
were it not for the strong restraining hand of the
home governments there would have been fighting
long ago.
There are two strong objections to the proposed
partition. One is that the three powers are bound by
the most solemn treaties to protect the independence
and territorial integrity of the group, and for them
to now divide the islands among themselves would be
spoliation. That, however, is a minor point in mod
ern diplomacy. It would be easy to find excuses for
breaking the treaty. It could be done in the name of
humanity, in the cause of civilization, in the higher
interests of the Samoans themselves; or it could be
placed upon the ground that islanders living outside
of Great Britain have no rights that Great Britain and
Continental nations are bound to respect.
The second objection is one that cannot be so
easily disposed of. It is based upon the fact that
there is no way of making an equal division of the
group. There are three large islands, Upolu, Tutuila
and Savaii. The first named contains the town of
Apia and the great bulk of the population. Which
ever power gets that island gets about all there is
of value in the group except the harbor of Pago-
Pago, which is ours. It is the question of the pos
session of Upolu when the distribution is made that
causes diplomacy to respect the existing treaty.
One possible solution of the difficulty seems to be
overlooked entirely; that of permitting the Samoans
to have the King they desire and to govern their own
country. The adoption of that simple expedient
would at once relieve the tension of the situation.
The Consuls of the three powers could then attend
strictly to their own business and quit interfering in
that of the others. At present each of them seems
desirous of being a king-maker and raises as much
fuss and ruction over it as the average ward boss does
when he undertakes to make a United States Senator.
THE WATERS AND FORESTS.
LAST Saturday there was sucessfully organized
the first concerted movement, in this State,
for the preservation of the forests and waters.
The subject interests our whole population, but is
one on which it has been difficult to arouse public
sentiment. Last summer The Call began a propa
ganda, and sent experts into the mountains to observe
and report upon the various forms of forest destruc
tion, by which the headwater sheds of our rivers are
being laid bare and every stream is being made tor
rential, delivering its water immediately, causing
floods and waste. The dry year touched at last every
interest concerned. The miners and irrigators had
no water for their u=es. The miner, lumberman,
rancher, dairyman, fruit planter, electric power com
panies all discovered that they were touched and hurt
in common by anything that increased the aridity of
the mountains by stripping their forests.
The result has been their combination in this prom
ising movement. They are reinforced by the strong
classes which have a secondary interest, the mer
chants, manufacturers and bankers, who through the
State Board of Trade and other organizations affiliate
with the movement and stand ready to back it.
The force of the Society for Conserving the Forests
and Waters is deposited in an executive committee,
which is under instruction to make a beginning by
memorializing the Governor and Legislature to pro
vide for an unsalaried commission which shall ex
haustively examine the subject and report to the next
Legislature a bill, or bills, for the legislation needed.
This committee is also instructed to ask the Legisla
ture to appropriate $5000 for the establishment in the
State University of a chair of forestry, thereby add
ing a school on that subject. This being done it is
intended that such school shall be instituted in time
to have a class in action by the time legislation is
completed two years hence and that the students shall
be used, under such statute, as the summer patrol of the
forests, to be paid by the State. This will put them
on the ground, in the midst of the subject of their
study, and will constitute a valuable summer school of
forestry. In this way the whole subject will be kept
out of partisan politics and the State will be trainfhg
expert foresters, who will ultimately have charge of
her forest crop, supervise its harvest when ready for
the ax and saw and preserve her forest area for suc
cessive and permanent production. Students who
need to work their way through the university and be
assured of a career when they finish their course will
find in the School of Forestry a most desirable means
to that end. Meantime, the whole State will have its
attention constantly upon this great economic subject,
and will back efficiently every policy which looks to the
permanency of our forests and the perpetuity of lumber
ing, mining, agriculture and all the interests which
are born into possibility when the seed sprouts which
is to make a tree.
The society wisely puts its purpose constantly be
fore the people in the motto chosen for its banner and
legend for its seal, in the old Arab proverb "The tree
is the mother of the fountain."
While Dr. Mallaby succeeded in avoiding payment
of duty on a lot of silk, and escaped conviction, al
though indubitably guilty of smuggling, he lost a
$10,000 position by his fraud, and will have to do a lot
of figuring to find where he comes out ahead in the
deal.
There ought to be an interesting story in connec
tion with a suit just dismissed after having been in the
courts of San Francisco thirty-one years, and the
story would naturally have a moral pointing to the
profitableness of litigation.
While the Kaiser is an impressive figure, the con
tract for impressing the United States and Great
Britain both at once is a large one, and to live up to
the specifications would require war-lording of high
degree.
The rumor in Paris of a Bonapartist revival may be
counted an evidence that for once the Parisians are
incapable of devising a novelty and have to amuse
themselves with any old thing.
NOT PROUD OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVE.
Petalunja Courier
If ever there was a case of a representative totally disregarding the
wishes of his constituents by his vote for United States Senator, our
Assemblyman from this district is that man. We do not believe that
there has been a time since Grant's name was first mentioned that one
fifth of the people in this locality favored him, and certainly during the
past week even this small following has left.
There is not a candidate who has received a vote at Sacramento for
the office of United States Senator who is not more deserving and better
qualified for the place than Grant, and in this vicinity General Barnes
is the choice of Republicans by at least ten to one.
The writer has been one of a few Republicans who has made a
partial canvass of Petaluma during the past few days, and after com
paring notes there was not a single man whom we interviewed who
favored Grant, and fully nineteen out of twenty were strongly in favor
of General Barnes.
We understand that Mr. Le Baron was wired strongly several days
ago, from both Petaluma and elsewhere, to this effect; but it seems he
continues his vote to suit himself, and possibly ex-Assemblyman Price,
who is the only Grant man besides Le Baron we have been able to hear
of in this district. A REPUBLICAN.

PROPOSE A
LIGHTING PLANT
FOR THE CITY
Supervisors Favor
Public Ownership.
WILL INVESTIGATE ITS COST
VALUES TO BE PLACED ON LAND
FOR PABK EXTENSION.
Owners to Submit Estimates of the
Value of Their Property and
Whether They Desire
to Sell.
The first move tending toward public
ownership of the utilities was made at
the regular meeting of the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday. Supervisor Lack
mann presented a resolution which at
once found favor with his collerigues on
the board. The resolution reads:
Whereas, -vast and excessive sums are
being expended yearly In the purchase of
lights for the public buildings and for light-
Ing the ttreets of -San Francisco; and
whereas, it is apparent that the munici
pality is being charged an exorbitant sum
fur the lighting of Mid streets anl pub*
lie buildings; and whereas, reliable sta
tistics indicate that the cost of municipal
lighting can be materially reduced by the
construction of a municipal lighting plant
owned and operated by the city; therefore
be it
Resolved. That it is the sense of this
board that the city and county of San
Francisco should construct a plant capable
of furnishing electric lights for the streets
and also for the lighting of, the public
buildings throughout the city, and that arc
lights should also be eupplied to merchants,
business men and al! residents and property
owners at actual cost whenever demanded;
and be it further
Resolved, That hia Honor the Mayor is
hereby authorized and empowered to em
ploy an expert to prepare a complete report
on the cost, together with a plan for the
construction of a plant which will be suffi
cient for supplying lights as above indi
cated, and also an esttmate on the ap
proximate cost of operating- the same, and
that paid report shall be made and filed
with this board within sixty days from this
date.
It was adopted, the Mayor being au
thorized to employ an expert. The Mayor
will report what progress he has mado
at the next meeting of the board. Su
pervisor Lackmann presented statistics
showing that the city is paying twice as
much for arc lights as is charged else
where.
Upon motion of Supervisor Perrault the
resolution authorizing the employment of
twenty-five extra policemen was' rescind
ed. Lackmann held that the city needed
the extra men, and had for a long time.
Their appointment was authorized by
the last Legislature, and the Police Com
missioners believe they have the power to
appoint. Dr. Perrault objected to the in
creased expenditure, saying the $101,000
debt from the old board should be paid
before others are contracted. He said all
departments of the city government will
suffer this year if expenses are to be
kept within the dollar limit. His ptta for
economy resulted in the defeat 6'f the
proposed measure.
The park panhandle project is being
pressed vigorously by Mayor Phelan. A
resolution was adopted yesterday calling
on all property owners on the line of
the proposed Improvement to submit to
the board before February 4 their esti
mate as to the value of their land and
improvements, and also to say whether
they are willing to sell. The board
pledged itself to provide necessary reve
nue in the manner provided by existing
laws for the acquisition of land for the
panhandle and boulevard.
The board was not apparently ready to
act upon the matter of setting aside ap
propriations to the amount of nearly
$100,000. The matter was again referred
to the Finance Committee, which had
already approved it.
The Southern Pacific Company was re
quested to grant a right of way for an
outlet sewer for the drainage of Sunny
side district at the intersection of Jarnac
street and Circular avenue.
The matter of the liability of the Sutter
street Railroad Company to repair Bush
street where its tracks were formerly
laid was referred to the City and County
Attorney for his opinion and as to what
action should be taken by the board to
compel the railroad company to make
such repairs as the street requires.
Supervisor Lackmann introduced a reso
lution to the effect that all city printing
be done in union offices. It was referred
to the Printing Committee.
The bills for street lighting, amounting
to about $40,000, which were referred at
the last meeting of the board to the
Street Light Committee, were transferred
to the Finance Committee for further
consideration.
The bills for the furnishing of the Stan
yan-street police station, amounting to
|6500, were laid over one week until an
opinion can be received from the City
and County Attorney,
The Superintf-mlont of Streets was em
powered to employ an export to assist in
making assessments for street work is
sued by the Superintendent of Streets.
His compensation will be $150 per month.
I. L. Bevans is the man who has been
recommended for the place.
The City and County Attorney was re
quested to furnish the board with an
opinion as to the obligations devolving
upon the lessor. Dr. D. F. Ragan, in the
matter of making repairs to the building
recently leased by the city from him for
the purposes of a police station at 507
Stanyan street.
Mrs. E. M. Casey, matron in the City
Prison, was discharged and Mrs. N. \V*.
Wright was appointed to the vacancy.
Mrs. Wright was formerly in charge of
the insane ward at the Receiving Hos
pital.
The petition of the Mutual Electric
Light Company to erect pfeles on public
streets outside the fire limits was referred
back to tho Stret Committee.
A resolution was introduced defining
the duties of the Water, Gas and Electric
Light Inspector. Supervisor Perrault had
some quiet fun with it. showing that it
was a physical impossibility for onp man
to fulfill all the requirements as proposed.
Voting for Senator.
The case of Charles F. Kenneally, As
semblyman, charged with manslaughter
in causing the death of Michael Quane,
an old man, was called In Judge Mogan's
court yesterday, and by consent was con
tinued until February 6. Kenneally's at
torney explained to the court that he
was in Sacramento engaged in voting in
the Senatorial contest.
THAT DREADED
LIST OF THE
"UNASSIGNED"
Teachers Waiting for
Roll Call.
A BIT OF LATE-BOARD HISTORY
DESTROYING THE REPORT OF A
FAVORITE'S UNFITNESS.
Issuing January Warrants to the
Teachersâ When Will the Pay
ing Time Come Around
to Them?
The question of whose name will adorn
the dreaded "unassigned list" is worry
ing by day and keeping awake o' nights
many a teacher in this city at present.
While nobody outside of the official who
occupies the School Superintendent's desk
yet knows to a certainty who compose the
fated number, it is well known that the
"list" unseen is growing. First it wan
thirty, then forty, sixty, seventy-five, one
hundred; now there can be no doubt that
the correct number will reach onÂ« hun
dred and twenty-five teachers that will
be consolidated out.
It is with some difficulty that many of
the principals have been made to believe
that the Superintendent meant what he
said when he ordered them to send in
data relative to their classes and pupil
enrollment. In some cases they hesitated
to give the information that would make
changes in the classes of favorite teach
ers, and in others the loss of classes
might mean the regrading of that school.
An eighteen-class school ranks a $200
--princlpal, with two vice principals to sup
port the dignity of the position. From
this it is quite easy to Â«cc now a princi
pal may bring himself to regret any
movement that might affect his financial
and educational grade.
The day school teachers are praying
that the impending stroke will come down
on the evening educators first, as the
scattering of those classes Into their own
will lift them to the fifty-standard and
salvation.
From their recent visits through the I
evf ning schools the visiting Directors have
received much practical education them
selves. They have found schools that
were only schools in name; where pupils
lounged into the class rooms only for
the purpose of finding a place to idle "away
a couple of hours of the early or dull
part of the evening. Discipline lax be
cause, principally, severity would only
drive the pupil from the class, a result
to be deplored by the teacher and
principal. Such condition, of course, does
not apply to all, as the visitors found,
but â¢where the school was topheavy with
instructors and short on the instructed.
A leaf from the history of the old
board has come to light by the publica
tion of the fact that a report was made !
to that body at its last meeting touching j
the ability of Miss L-dia Carroll. She, is
the vice principal of the Mission High I
School, and was charged by Principal i
O'Connor with being "deficient in scholar
ship" and "unable to impart knowledge
to her pupils." O'Connor requested the
board to assign her to some other school,
declaring that she would never leave and
I was of no use to the school. Miss Car
roll is the niece of ex-Director Hammond,
then in office, and was elected to her posi
tion last March, having just graduated
from the High School and her experi
ence as a teacher covered only a few i
months when given her position in the !
Mission School. As Hammond's vote was ;
needed at the last meeting of the board !
to pass one of its outrageous measures,
the report and complaint were destroyed.
O'Connor, however, kept tally on the
matter, and the present board will hear
more from him on the subject.
Regarding the matter of removing a
teacher for incompetency, it is a question
as to whether it can be brought about.
I The burden of proof is on the department
and the mere say so of the principal or j
complaining witness will not pass with
the Superior or Supreme court should
some dismissed teacher take it into his
or her head to fight such case. Years
may roll over such litigation, boards may
come and boards may go, each succeeding
body inheriting the suit from its prede
cessor. Once a teacher, always a teacher,
may be the rule unless the school direc
tory succeed in establishing the prece
dent, as it is trying to do, of abolishing
a teacher by scattering the classes.
Yesterday was warrant dayâ and it used
to be equivalent to pay day, but that is
another storyâ for the teachers. With
the injunctions hanging over the pay
master there is no telling when the coin
will appear. There is fervent talk of a i
resort to mandamus pressures for the j
payment of this month's salaries, and a i
few more troubles will be added to those |
already piled up.
One of the matters which the School
Directors have been discussing since they
assumed office is the chaotic financial j
condition which ha s s confronted them. ,
They were bequeathed an indebtedness of j
over $200,000 by their predecessors, i
Auditor Asa R. "Wells submitted a finan
cial statement to them yesterday that
shows they will have $543,258 62 with which
to run the department for the ensuing

ARMED FORCES
ARE GUARDING
NEVILLS' MINE
Not at His Bidding,
However.
SEEKS RELIEF IN THE COURTS
MILLIONAIRE WOULD ENJOIN
' HIS PAKTNEKS.
He Asks That the Title to the App
Property Be Determined and
That His Associates Make
an Accounting.
Captain William E. Nevills, the mil
lionaire, has been driven from his min
ing properties in Calaveraa County
armed force, he avers, and this miniatur
army still threatens his life and will carry
Its threat into effect if he ventures to
cross the border of the disputed terri
tory. In consequence Captain Nevil]
appealed to the courts, and through
power hopes to recover his own and ren
der his mining partners, William 11. Mar
tin and John Ballard, hors de combat,
or at least force them to arbitrate.
Suit was filed yesterday by Captain
Xevills, through his attorneys, Riordan
& Lande and A. H. Ricketts, for an in
junction, its purpose being to prevent
Martin and Ballard from inter:
I meddling with, working or removing
I or metals from the Rawhide and
i mines, and for an accounting of the prof
-1 its from the mines named during the pe
i riod since the dispossession of Nevills,
; which occurred on the 14th fnst. Inter
esting developments are expected, and
also some trouble, though how much re
mains to be seen.
On the filing of the action for injunc
-1 tion Myer Jacobs was appointed receiver
of the property in dispute. His bonds
i were fixed at $00.000, upon which the Pa
cific Surety Company qualified, and an
other bond of $50,000 was required by
Judge Hebbard as an undertaking on
the temporary restraining order, upon
which the American Surety Company
qualified. Matters being thus arranged
Mr. Jacobs will proceed to take charge of
the mines in dispute, all the stock, money
and other assets, and, being backed by
the order of court, it is expected that he
will have no trouble.
In his petition for an injunction Mr.
Xevills sets forth the various transfers
of the mining property to as many named
corporations. Originally Captain Xevills
j was the owner of all the stock of the
I company that handled the Rawhide
! mine. In August of 1891, fur the consld
[ eration of $swO down and promises upon
paper of $23,000 at future dates he trans
ferred half of the stock of the company
i to the defendants named, and the com
j pany was incorporated under the name of
the Guild Gold Mining Company, with
100,000 shares of stock. In October.
I the name of the corporation was changed
to the Rawhide Gold Mining Company,
with 100,000 shares of stock, which were
divided equally between the plaintiff and
defendants, each taking one-third there
of. Subsequently, on August 2<J, IS9*. the
I company was rein A, with a
capital stock of I v.ith 150,000
shares, and the name of the company was
changed to the App Consolidated Gold
Mining Company, each partner retaining
one-third of the stock. On December 29,
! Mr. Xevills avers, the App mining prop
erty was transferred to the company and
was accepted as the property of the co
partnership. It remained in the peaceful
i possession of the coportnership until the
i 14th inst., when, it is alleged, the de
j fendants, with force of arms, took pos
j session of the App mine and expelled
the plaintiff, and still threaten to kill
him should he venture across the lines.
This action on the part of his mining
partners, Xevills avers, is the result of
' a secret conspiracy to deprive him of
the mine and to secure for Martin and
Ballard the profits accruing there
from.
In the prayer of the petition Captain
I Xevills asks that the court declare that
I the copartnership is the owner of the
mine, to compel defendants to account for
all receipts and disbÂ«rsements since the
petitioner's dispossession and to prohibit
i the defendants from asuming control or
running the mines during the trial of
the action for permanent injunction.
As Judge Hebbard ordered the tem
porary restraining order to issue, the
management of the mines will be, for the
time at least, taken from the hands of
j the defendants, and perhaps perpetually,
] if on the 10th of February, the date set
for the hearing of the issues involved,
they cannot show cause why the tempor
ary restraining order shoud be dissolved
and the management again placed in
their hands.

TOR THE NORMAL SCHOOL.
; The Friends of the Institution Pub
licly Protest Against Its
Abolition.
A citizens' meeting was held in Supe
rior Court Department 6 at the City
Hall last evening to protest against the
action of the Board of Education in abol
ishing the San Francisco Normal School.
The room was crowded with the students
and friends of the institution. W. G. Job
son was chosen chairman and W. H. Bod
j fish secretary.
An organization called the San Fran
cisco League of Education was formed,
j with the following executive committee
to take charge of the matters of the or
ganization between sessions: D. B. Mc-
Neil, M. Cooney, William Henderson, O.
K. Hahn, T. B. Evans, John Moffitt, Wil
liam Oakley, John Dwyer, E. J. Sheehan,
W. G. Jobson and W. H*. Bodfis'h.
Judge Cooney offered the following res
olution, which was adopted:
]:â¢ solved -A. That the Board of Education of
San Francisco be and is hereby requested to
reconsider the vote by which it resolved to
abolish the Normal School of San Francisco.
B. That under do circumstances should the
school be abolished or closed, if at all, until
after the graduation of the present class, and
we most respectfully and most earnestly de
mand its restoration for that purpose at least.
C. That a State Normal School should be estab
lished in San Francisco without delay, and we
ask the present Board of Education and the
Superintendent of Schools to co-operate with
us And use its best efforts toward securing such
a school for our city. D. That the thanks of
this meeting be and are hereby tendered to that
part of the press of San Francisco that has so
ably defended the Normal School and so elo
quently and justly pleaded the rights of the
present normal class.
The following communication was read
disproving the assertion made by the
Board of Education in its reports rela
tive to the refusal of Alameda County to
accept San Francisco's Normal School
diplomas:
Office of the Superintendent of Public Schools
of Alameda County, Cal. Oakland, January
16, ISS9.
The County Board of Education of Alameda
mixes the San Francisco Normal grad
uate?, and on their diploma* with Indorsements
by the city and county of San Francisco grants
grammar grade certificates.
T. O. CRAWFORD, County Superintendent.
Judge Henry E. Highton addressed the
league, giving a somewhat humorous ac
count of the action of the Board of Ed
ucation in its session on the evening so
: fatal to the Normal School.
The following petition of 101 girls of the
school was read:
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 18, 1899.
To the Honorable Board of Education of Ran
Francisco, Gentlemen: We, the under
signed students of the San Francisco Normal
School, make the following statement: We en
tered the school last August in good faith,
answering all the requirements, bought our
books, studied hard, have completed half the
course, passing our examinations In the same,
and did bo for the sole purpose of receiving: a
diploma at the end of the school year. Many
pave up positions to do this, while others have
come from neighboring counties because of the
reputation of the school, and have undergone
expense that they could ill afford.
The students object to taking teachers' ex
aminations on the ground that a certificate
thus obtained does not possess the merit
throughout the State that a diploma from this
school does.
The students petition for a restabHshment of
the San Francisco Normal School and to be
I allowed to contribute such sum to the public
school fund as will be necessary for its support
and maintenance to the end of the fiscal year,
BO that we may be properly graduated. Re
spectfully sumhitted.
ONE HUNDRED AND FOUR STUDENTS.
The meeting adjourned, after announc
ing that the executive committee would
convene this evening in Judge Cooney's
office.
Dr. Tillman's Patient.
Dr. Til I man. interne of the City and
County Hospital, who so gallantly volun
teered to accompany Charles Storey, the
smallpox patient, from tho hospital to
the Pesthouse, reports his patient as
getting better. The young physician ex
pects to be back at hi? work In the
County Hospital in about n month.

an especially catchy one. The wins of
the well backed outsiders. Brown Prince
and Strongoli, to start off with, shook
the ring up, which, followed by the victo
ries of four straight favorites, caused
more than a feeling of unrest among the
layers of odds.
The mile and a sixteenth selling affair
was responsible for the prettiest bit of
racing seen during the afternoon. The
blaze faced Satsuma was Installed first
choice in the betting, but at post time
Rosinante had been played down to equal
favoritism. Pat Dunne and his following
set their checks down on David Tenny,
and only hard luck prevented them from
cashing. The outsider Balllster made the
running for a short distance, when H.
Martin moved to the front with Tenny.
He was followed by Jones, astride of Sat
suma. and when the stretch was reached
the pair engaged in a battle royal. Pass
ing the paddock, with Satsuma beaten,
Martin failed to observe Thorpe coming â 
fast on the outside with Rosinante, and |
was defeated by a head in l:46^i. Satsuma j
was three lengths further away.
A very cheap bunch of platers lined up
in the opening event, with Gratify closing
a3 to 'I favorite. He ran a frightful race,
never showing a particle of speed. Brown j
Prince, ridden by Powell, and 8 and 10 to |
1 in the betting, won easily from Eppin- i
ger.
The sprint for three-year-olds over the |
Futurity course was considered such a
"moral for Lava tor that the odds |
against the Jennings* entry fell to 1 to 2 j
In no time. There was such a well de
fined play on Strongoli that from 15 the !
price was sliced down to 8 and 10.
Hullman got the outsider away first and
he fairly rolled in. four open lengths
ahead of the favorite. The other starters j
did not seem overburdened with speed..
With First < "all scratched from the I
seven furlong run Dunois was sent out a j
4 to S chance. Quickly showing in front, I
Ryan's useful horse galloped in first, a ]
couple of lengths in advance of Whitcomb. I
San Venarto came from the rear, taking
show honors from Recreation.
Tho old sprinter O'Connell was ready
money in the six furlong sprint that fol
lowed. With Piggott on his back he was
In front almost from the jump, winning â¢
cleverly at the finish from Etta H. Cyril
WB4 third. 11. Martin, on Sfy, gave a mis
erable exhibition.
In the closing number on the card Ma
grane's filly Free Lady received most of i
the support, and at odds of 8 to 5 won all
the way. Meadow Lark, to the delight j
of a great many, managed to get the
place from Frohman.
Track Notes.
In future the entry of Gratify will not
be accepted at Oakland track. The judges
so decided after the bad showing made
by the chestnut horee in the opening race.
The official form book, containing all
the races run at both tracks since the
opening of the season, and published by
the Daily Racing News, was again issued
on Saturday.
While Johnny Coleman is away duck
shooting, Hughey Jones chalks up prices
for the Stuyvesant Club.
Seventeen books were doing business
yesterday, and there was no complaint of
lack of play. %
Yellow Tail, the fast two-year-old in the
Burns & Waterhouse stable, will probably
not be seen at the barrier again here. He
will be reserved for his Eastern engage-
! ments. , .
Ed Purser backed Strongoli in every
i book that would take his money, and
made a neat clean-up.
; Sly should be. worth a good bet next
; time out. Not unlike San Venado, the
; mare is consistent if nothing else. One
j good, then a bad race.
Rosinante was made the subject for a
; little boosting. When the mare had pol
ished off David Tenr.y she was put up to
be sold. Entered for $500. Abe Stein bid
her up to $900. the stable, of course, com
ing back with the customary $3 bid. Jim
my Coffey was very wrr.thy. and threat
ened to use "Kid" McCoy's "corkscrew
i punch" on Stein, but nothing came of it.

MISSING MICHAEL FREiiSE.
Disappeared Last September and His
Friends Fear Foul Play.
Michael Freese, sometimes known as
"Balzer," disappeared from this city four
months ago, and nothing has been heard
from him since that time. His friends
and relatives are mystified at his long
absence from home, and are beginning to
believe there has been foul play.
The missing man was employed for a
number of years as floor walker for the
Cutting Packing Company, and at the
time of his disappearance was working
for the corporation, and was considered
by his employers as one of their most
faithful men. The company has interest
ed itself in an endeavor to locate Freese,
and every effort is being made to ascer
tain his whereabouts.
On September 25 last Freese went to
work as usual, accompanied by his wife.
Mrs. Freese went to her husband's place
of business in the evening, and they start
ed home together. Freese entered a sa
loon on Market street while on the way
home, and left his wife standing on the
sidewalk, telling her he would be out in
a few minutes. This is the last time he
has been seen by any of his friends. She
waited for some time, but her husband
not putting in an appearance, she went
to her home, 5 Harrison avenue, alone.
As Freese had been drinking quite heav
ily for two weeks previous to his disap
pearance, his wife thought when he failed
to come home that he had gone on a
spree; but when several days passed and
he had not put in an appearance she be
came alarmed and notified her brother,
who made Inquiries for the missing man.
At the saloon he entered when he left his
wife Freese was not very well known,
and none of the attaches of the place re
membered of having seen any one an
swering his description.
The family relations of the missing man
were amicable, and he was in good finan
cial circumstances, so his relatives are at
a lose for a motive Freese might have
in leaving the city voluntarily. While
they have about come to the conclusion
that he was foully dealt with, his friends
have not entirely given up hope that he
may be found. They are making every
effort to locate him.
CONTRACTORS' OPPORTUNITIES.
Californians to Have an Equal
Chance for Government Work.
Several days ago a dispatch was sent to
â Washington by the Chamber of Com
merce asking that California contractors
be given a chance to bid for contracts for
new constructions contemplated by the
United States In the Pacific. Yesterday
an answer was received from M. T. Endi
cott, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and
Docks, Navy Department, In which he
says:
It has occurred to the bureau that your tele
gram may have been prompted by accounts of
recent lettlngs for work of improvement at
Guam. Ladrone Islands. Just before the ex
piration of the last calendar year an effort was
made to contract for some work there In the
way of buildings, strel pier, eto., and a few
bidders upon this coa3t were assembled In New
York by the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts,
by telegraph, and their proposals received. As
these were not satisfactory, all the bids were
rejected. It has not yet been decided what
step to take In this direction, and if these im
provements are carried out under the direction
of this bureau merchants and contractors on
the Pacific Coast shall have an opportunity
to bid upon them.
Dr. George C. Parties,
Eye. Ear. Nose and Throat, has removed
to Chronicle building, second floor. â¢
Death of James Megannon.
James L. Mcgannon died Sunday night
at his residence, 313 Ellis street. Three
weeks ago he contracted a severp cold,
which developed into pneumonia. He ral
lied somewhat from the f> attack, but the
end finally came. "Jim" Megannon, as
he was familiarly called by his associates,
was a genial, whole-souled fellow and his
friends, of which he had a host, are sin
cerely grieved at his demise. He has held
various positions of trust in the City Hall
and has ever been regarded as honorable
and faithful to a marked degree. He
leaves a. mother and brother to mourn his
loss. He was born in this city thirty-one
years ago. The funeral will take place
from the residence this afternoon at 2
o'clock.

"KID" McCOY
ON HIS WAY
TO THIS CITY
Clever Boxer Needs
Rest and Coin.
HE MAY MEET JOE KENNEDY
JACK BONNEB AND MANAGER
ARRIVE TO-DAY.
The National Club Has Invited "The
Only" Tim Hurst to Referee
the Preliminary Bouts of
This Evening.
"Kid" McCoy â the miniature heavy
weight, who, for reascms best known
to himself, failed to whip "Sailor"
vSharkeyâ will leave Chicago to-day for
this city, where he expects to- enjoy sev
eral weeks of glorious climate and in
cidentally reap a few dollars by the
powers of his fists.
McCoy, in a letter to a friend, stated
that he did not expect "to get on" a
match with any of the enterprising
heavy-weights of Frisco, but that if
there should be any man among them
who aspires to championship form he
(McCoy) may be induced by a little
coaxing to put on the gloves again.
Doubtless a twenty-round contest be
tween McCoy and Joe Kennedy may
be arranged. It will be remembered
that Kennedy was matched to fight Jim
Jeffries in February, and that this pro
posed match fell through because Jef
fries recently accepted a very flattering
offer from an Eastern club to fight
Champion Fitzsimmons. Kennedy has
been training several weeks for the
match and is consequently out in
pocket. However, if some enterprising
club should arrange a bout between
the coy McCoy and Kennedy it would
certainly "pull" a large gathering of
ring patrons, as there are thousands of
sports in this city who are very anxious
to- see the artful "Kid" in fighting ac
tion. McCoy is expected to arrive
about Saturday next.
Jack Bonner and his manager, Bo
gan, will arrive this evening. Bonner
will doubtless be matched to 'fight
George Green; that is, unless the last
named fighter is still desirous of a
much needed rest.
The National Club has completed all
arrangements for its entertainment this
evening. Latest news from the train
ing quarters of the men who are book
ed to meet, is to the effect that McCon
nell and Neill are both in fine condi
tion and that they may be counted
upon to put up a good, stiff argument.
It is whispered around that "Cocker"
Tweedie has been slightly under the
weather for some days past at his
training quarters, which are located at
the Six Mile House, as the result of
an unexpected meeting with Professor
La Grippe. His trainers contend, how
ever, that the "Cocker" is physically
able to go a hard race and that he will
give a first-class account of himself
when he meets Charley Tye.
"Jockey" Maynard and Willie Cole
are both anxious and ready to open
fire and their friends do not hesitate
to say that their bout will be the most
entertaining feature of the evening.
Jim McDonald will referee the McCon
nell and Neill contest and Tim Hurst
has been invited to pass judgment on
the Tweedie and Tye fifteen round bout.
The National Club h*s announced that
with the exception or a few choice seats
the reserved seats have all been pur
chased. _Â«______^___
RELIGIOUS CHANGES OF
THE PAST CENTURY
UNITARIAN CLUB HEARS MANY
VIEWS EXPRESSED.
Jew and Christian Hold That the
Tendency Has Been for a Gen
eral Broadening Out.
The Unitarian Club held its regular
meeting and dinner at the Merchants'
Club rooms on Sansome street last night.
For some time past it has been customary
to have discussion on current topics of
political significance, but last night saw a
departure from the usual order a and the
discussion was turned on "The Religious
Situation at the Close of the Nineteenth
Century."
Rev. J. T. Sunderland of Oakland
opened the discussion by telling of the
religious condition in India, the birthplace
and home of the oldest religions which
have lived unchanged to the present day.
"Asia," he said, "is the mother of re
ligion and sacred books, and India is the
heart and intellect of Asia. Its inhabi
tants are great thinkers, and they think
mostly on religious subjects. Hindooism
or Buddhism is the great religion of
India and is Interwoven with the history
of the country. Next comes Brahmartism,
a foreign religion. Its followers are a
superior people, intelligent, independent,
but unprogresslve and opposed to any
thing and everything contrary to the
Koran. The Christianizing of India will
bo brought about by three things: Eng
lish civilization, now rapidly spreading;
Indian reform movements and missionary
work."
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger then spoke on
religious progress from the Jewish
standpoint, and the wonderful change ef
fected in the condition of the Jew in the
past century. In that time he has been
given a home, his rights are recognized,
he has lost the hunted look which once |
was a mark of the Jew, and is settling
down to broader ideals and a comfortable
home in America.
Rev. Charles R. Brown of Oakland con
sidered the "Growth, Changes and Pros
pects of the Orthodox Churches." Briefly
summarized his opinions were that the old
orthodoxy is dying away in the broader
light of a* new and advanced religious era. |
It is admitting a wider belief, paying less
attention to dogmas than ever and
preaching Christ's message of the
brotherhood of man and universal love.
The evening concluded with a brief his
torical review of the century's religious j
changes by Professor Clyde A. Duniway
of Stanford University. He said that the !
past century was essentially of Pro- ,
testahtismâ not anti-Catholicism. but J
that Protestantism which is rejecting j
forms and stumbling blocks and allowing |
of a freedom of growth.
Rev. W. B. Geoghegan of Berkeley was
to have spoken on the "Basis of Hope for
Religious Unity," but was unable to be
present. Sheldon D. Kellogg, president of
the club read a letter from Rev. Horatio
Stebbins regretting his inability to be
present.
POOLSELLERS' TECHNICALITIES !
The Trial of John Smith Again
Postponed on Defense's Motion.
The fates seem to be against the pros
ecution of John Smith, a clerk of H.
Schwartz, charged with violating the
pool-selling ordinance. Last Friday ob
jection was taken by Attorney Long, for
the defendant, against the venire ueing i
issued for Police Court No. 4, instead of !
the Police Court of the City and County ]
of San Francisco, and the objection was
sustained.
A new venire was issued, and when the !
case was called before Judge Treadwell I
yesterday afternoon it was found that
only 40 of the venire of fifty had been
summoned. Attorney Long promptly
raised the objection that his client was
entitled to the full venire, and the judge
sustained the objection. Another venire
of fifty was ordered. Long then moved
for a dismissal of tue case, but the Judge
declined to grant the motion, and set the
case for Thursday afternoon.
THE PRESIDENT CASE.
Judge De Haven Decides That the
Steamship Must Pay Damages.
United States District Judge de Havon
yesterday decided in favor of the com
plainants in the case of Benjamin F. Gray
and others against the steamship presi
dent, and referred the matter as to the
amount of damages to Court Commis
sioner Manley to ascertain and report
upon the same.
â ~..e complainants alleged that the de
fendant had entered into a contract with
them, on the payment of $15 e.i('h. to
carry them from St. Michael to I.nalakhk
In Alaska, but had refused to allow them
to land at that point and had carried
them to S;in Francisco against their pro
test. They alleged also that they had
received bad food and accommodation,
and the skipper lacerated their feelings
by swearing at them.
Judge de Haven decided that the last
two allegations had not been established
by the evidence, but that the defendant
had violated the contract by not waiting
at Unalaklik a sufficient length of time to
enable them to make a landing.
Stood Up by a Highwayman.
John Hyland, while on his way home at
2 o'clock on Sunday morning, met a
bold, bad highwayman on Mission street,
near Twenty-first, who ordered Hyland to
throw up his hands and then dealt him
a blow on the side of the head with some
blunt instrument, which knocked him un
conscious for the time being. The foot
pad then left him lying on the sidewalk.
When Hyland came to he went to the
City and County Hospital, where Dr.
Roche found that the blow had not only
cut the scalp, but peeled it down the side
of the head. It required seven stitches
to close the wound.
Lecture by E. H. Wells.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 23.â At the Presbyter
ian Church on Tuesday evening of this
week Mr. E. Hazard Wells will deliver
a lecture upon Alaska and the Klondike,
illustrated by sixty stereopticon views.
No admission fee will be charged, the kc
ture being given by request of the Broth
erhood of Andrew and Philip of the
church. Mr. Wells was one of the first
white men to explore Alaska. He com
manded the Arkell and Harrison expedi
tion to Alaska in IRM-91.
, . â¦ .
The Bacon Place Cases.
A jury was obtained in Judge Graham's
court yesterday afternoon on the first of
the Bacon place cases of vagrancy to be
tried. The defendant is Marcella Delorde.
Secretary Kane of the Pacific Coast Soci
ety for the Suppression of Vice was
the only witness examined, and his cross
examination by Attorney Ach had not
finished when court adjourned. The case
will be continued Thursday afternoon.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 23.â Speculation in stocks
to-day passed previous high record marks both
In volume and in prices attained. Transac
tions in stocks figured for 1,620.000 shares, and
the sales of bonds reached $9,046,000. Trading
was furious at the opening and the highest
prices were reached in most of the stocks, on
the initial bulge, with advances of 5 to 10
points in some cases. There were subsequent
violent breaks on realizing of profits. The mar
ket then became quieter until another exhi
bition of strength In the afternoon, when the
coalers and Gould stocks got to the best. The
bank statement, which seemed to assure easy
money, was the mainspring In the market
strength. London opened firm, but declined on
operators taking profits, and then steadied on
curb transactions. The extent of the public's 1
Interest in the market was reflected by the |
congestion of business in the Stock K\''hange
and in the commission houses. For instance,
it was annour.'-ei to a broker's customer to
day that all orders would be subject to delay as
their representatives on the floor were unable
to attend all of their business, and that floor
broknrs Â«^ r^ refusing orders, as they had
n their hands than they could execute.
As an incident conveying an Impression of the
extent ot the early advance, one customer who
hn-l given an order to sell a block of an active
\>-Uf received {20,000 more than the order
called for. Large uperatore are believed to
have realized heavily in the early dealincs
.but there was said to lie considerable taking
back 01 stock in the afternoon that had been
earlier and round amounts of stocks were
i by the traders. Some of the more
sensational movements were an advance of

selling movement dropped prices rapidly.
Brooklyn Transit, Union Pacific, St. Paul. Cen
tral and many oth.-r stocks yielded from 2 to
6 points. The market became dull in the after
noon but livened up later under the leadership
of the coalers. Enormous purchases of Read
ing carried the price up 7%, and other coal
ers were lifted from 14 to 4V4. The movement
spread to Ontario iin.l Western, which jumped
b% on transH<-tions of over 100,000 shares. The
belief swnip.l to t,e that the company would
benefit by the better conditions which were said
to exist in the anthracite coal trade. It was
said that a plan for harmonizing the conflict
ing interests in the trade had reached a pre
liminary stage. The grangers were rather
quiet In the afternoon. Speculative Interest
centered in the specialties. Notwithstanding
the undertone of strenfith In speculation many
shares closed notably lower. The more prom

the reported plan of the controlling interests of
the New York Central ns far as they relate to

CHICAGO MARKETS. V
CHICAGO, Jan. 23.â Higher cables from Liv
erpool and nervousness on the part of the.
shorts started wheat. May opened 'Afi%c higher
at 71(g'71 and made, a further advance during
the next few minutes. Wall-street securities
1 were active as ever and showed the same re
i markable tendency as for some weeks back.
! The wheat speculators here could not help
; being influenced bulllshly by such an exhibition
! of unexplainable strength and as the session
advanced the market became very strong.
1 The world's shipments of wheat to Europe last
I week amounted to 6,406,000 bushels, and all
but 1,208,000 of that was from American ports.
! The â  visible v supply increased 338,000 bushels,
I whereas an increase of 1,000,000 bushels had
been expected. During the afternoon the indi
cations were very apparent that Eastern specu
lators with stock market profits were buyers
lof wheat here. May went up to 72t/724c and
j closed strong at 72c buyers.
I â An increase In speculation and a moderately
firm undertone were the developments In corn,
j which were attributed directly to the rapid
i pace of the New York, stock market. The
' great strength of wheat near the close caused
an excess of energy to be displayed in the
buying of corn and the close was at the top
of the day. a gain of lc.
Oats shared in the general bullish feeling
that prevailed on the floor. May advanced
%c.
The strength in grains and buying developed
a strong undertone in provisions. The offer
ings were readily absorbed and the session
ended â  with -an advance all around, 124 c in
pork, "Vie In lard and 6c in ribs.

' he Senate then, at 2:10 p. m., on mo

tee on Foreign Relations, went into exec
utive session. After the executive ses-
Bion Chandler called up the bill to restore
to their original status officers of the
navy and marine corps who lost their

The bill went over on objection, and at

Britain. In so doing he pointed out
that the Dreibund has been weakened
by the Franco-Italian raprochement
and the Russian - Austrian entente.
France, he added, only desired the
peace of Europe, and to that end
Frenchmen ought to forget their in
ternal dissensions and think more of
France.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, M.
del Casse, ascending the tribune, said
his policy has been directed toward
conserving the permanent general in
terests of France. He recalled the role
of France during the Hispano-Ameri
can war and said the appeal addressed
to France "by one of the two nations,
with which he had equally cordial re
lations," was all to the honor of France
and the Government could not refuse
its assistance, knowing "that it would
not be misconstrued by our friends in
America." The result, he added, was
"a moral advantage for France which
nu one failed to understand."
Referring to the Czar's disarmament
proposals the Minister said France's
whole sympathies supported them for
two reasons â the good of humanity and
respect for the nation, with which her
friendship was never more complete
than now. France, M. del Casse con
tinued, is aware that nothing will be
asked of her in the nature of diminish
ing her strength.
Relative to the protection of Eastern
Christians France's historic position
had not been weakened in the slightest
degree. Unfortunately, he proceded,
there was a reverse side to the picture.
The great states of the world differ,
but he believed their disputes might be
settled in a spirit of conciliation. It
was in this spirit that the Fashoda In
cident had been settled.
M. del Casse then went on to narrate
the diplomatic incidents already known
in connection with the Fashoda ques
tion and praised General Lord Kitch
ener's treatment of Major Marchand,
the French officer who occupied Fash
oda. But, he said, in the general in
terest of France the Government de
cided it was advisable to evacuate
Fashoda. The honor of France was in
no way tarnished, but M. del Casse be
lieved true patriotism was to avert a
conflict which would be a calamity for
the entire world and entail sacrifices
altogether disproportionate to the in
terests at stake.
The Foreign Minister said in con
clusion: "France is always ready to
negotiate, being conscious of her rights.
Great changes are preparing through
out the world, and therefore it is neces
sary to walk prudently. To complete
our task in a dignified manner the full
support of the Chamber is necessary."
The House then adjourned.
AGUINALDO AGAIN
PROCLAIMS HIS REPUBLIC
MANILA, Jan. 23.â Aguinaldo pro
claimed a Philippine republic at Malo
los this morning. There was no public
demonstration in Manila. Spanish civil
prisoners will be set free by the insur
gents. Rival native authorities at Cebu
are reported to be fighting, and the
town is endangered. Aguinaldo's gov
ernment cannot maintain order in the
interior of Luzon, and native authori
ties are robbed and murdered. If
Aguinaldo commences hostilities
against the Americans the northern
province will probably shake off his
yoke.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 24, 1899.
YOUNG VANISHES
TO AVOID TRIAL
Alleged Fire Fiend a
Fugitive.
MRS. YOUNG UNDER ARREST
PECULIAR REDUCTION OF THE
SUSPECT'S BONDS.
Lowered From Two Thousand to One
Thousand Dollars on the Last
Day of District Attorney
Martinelli's Term.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Jan. 23.â E. B. Marti
nelli rests in a political grave, but the
memory of his incumbency was forced
upon the public to-day by the failure
of Henry Young, the alleged incendiary
of Tiburon, to appear at the time set
for his preliminary examination on the
charge of arson. Subsequently it was
discovered that Young's bonds had
been changed and reduced under cir
stances leading to the suspicion that
the accused man intended to flee the
country, the result being that a bench
warrant of arrest was issued. Con
stable Lewis Hughes is now searching
for Young in San Francisco, and the
house of a brother-in-law of the de
fendant in Alameda is being watched
by the officers.
Another sensation was ingrafted into
the tale by the arrest of Mrs. Youns:
on the charge of arson and her incar
ceration in the County Jail, where she
is closely watched to prevent any at
tempt at suicide.
After twelve impatient witnesses
from Tiburon had waited an hour this
morning Attorney J. W. Cochrane in
formed Justice Rodden that Young
was too ill to appear. His request for
a continuance was at first opposed by-
District Attorney Mclsaac, but that
official finally yielded a point and the
case went over until Thursday next.
Later it was discovered that on rec
ommendation of Martinelli, Justice
Rodden had reduced Young's bail from
$2000 to $1000 on December 31, tne last
day of Martinelli's incumbency, and
that Attorney M. F. Cochrane had been
succeeded thereon by Albert C. AVols
show of 460 Pacific a-enue. Alameda,
who is a brother-in-law of the defend
ant. A bench warrant of arrest was
then issued for Young's apprehension.
Mrs. Young w r as arrested on the evi
dence supplied by Matilda Lutzone./a
servant girl, who saw her and her hus
band taking kindling wood Into the
house on the night of the fire. She
cried bitterly when placed in jail, but
was perfectly cool when arrested. She
first declared that her husband lay ill
in San Francisco, but forgot the place
and the attending physician and got
badly mixed as regards the last time
she saw him. Young was seen in Ala
meda on Friday nightâ some claim last
night, and was in this city and in
good health last Thursday.
The general opinion is that Justice
Rodden has been imposed upon. Mar
tinelli has "forgotten the reasons for
the reduction of ball." but thinks it
might have been because of a tele
phonic request from Attorney Coch
rane.
Inquiry at "vVolsshow's house in Ala
meda to-night develops the fact that
Young is supposed to be in San Fran
cisco Officers watched the place this
afternoon and are still on duty to
night.
FIRST SCRIMMAGE
AT CARSON CITY
Senatorial Row in the
Assembly.
Spedal Dispatch to The Call.
CARSON CITY, Jan. 23.â This morn
ing, from the quietude that prevailed,
no one would have thought that a
Senatorial campaign was on. Both
Newlands and Stewart seemed to have
made their canvass and both were rest-
ing on their oars. The first little scrim
mage came off in the Assembly during
the afternoon session. A petition was
presented from Lyon County, denounc
ing Stewart and recommending New
lands to succeed him. Speaker Allen
objected to the petition and declared it
out of order. An objection was raised
and a vote called for. The vote was:
Ayes 14, noes 14, one member absent
and the speaker not voting. The chair
was sustained and the petition dropped.
Stewart and his friends seem to think
that their fight is won, while Newlands
pays that if he is not elected Stewart
cannot be and a deadlock will follow.
This seems to please Russell, Mason
and Flanigan, as they realize that their
only hope is in such a condition. It is
understood that in case of a failure to
elect Stewart, and Newlands has not
the necessary strength, the latter will
trade everything in line to elect Flani
gan, a Republican.
In the Leidy investigation which
came up this morning in the Assembly
the matter was referred to a committee
which will not report until Wednesday.
Little has been shown to substantiate
the charges.
The battle royal is billed for noon to
morrow. __________________
"MEXICAN" MORPHY'S
BREAK FOR LIBERTY
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 23.â Santiago
Morphy, the Mexican bank embezzler,
and American turfman, made two
fights for liberty and the last proved
successful. The first battle was at
law, by habeas corpus, setting up the
expiration of the extradition treaty and
the irregularity of the proceedings.
Judge Partange of the United States
District Court sustained the Govern
ment and to-day turned the prisoner
over to Major Juan Solares, the Mili
tary Chief of Police of the City of Mex
ico. In the evening Solores took his
man >from the Parish Prison to convey
him to the Southern Pacific depot. They
walked along Canal street, the prin
cipal thoroughfare, always crowded at
night, stopped at a small restaurant for
dinner, and when they emerged, Mor
phy's friends had their plan arranged.
The Mexican had gone scarcely half a
square when a crowd pocketed them.
Major Solares was struck on the head.
Morphy rushed through a saloon. Half
a dozen men ran in different directions,
and Bolares was left alone, dazed and
deserted. Morphy jumped Into a cab
and drove out to the rear of the city,
where several race horse trainers live.
The city police are trying to find him.
SCHLEY CHARGED

AT SANTIAGO
During tf)e Discussion of Naval
Promotions It Is Alleged the
Commodore F^ao prom
Cervera's Ships.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â The entire
executive session of the Senate to-day
was devoted wholly to the discussion of
the promotion of Admiral Sampson and
Schley and other naval officers engaged
in the Santiago campaign, over the
heads of officers who were their supe
riors in rank. The controversy was
then postponed for tw-enty days, after
a vote had been taken to call for the
records of the Navy Department bear
ing upon the conduct of all affected by
their advancement. The discussion
arose over the resolution, of which Sen
ator Butler was the author, calling for
these documents. As originally offered
it asked for the reasons for the ad-
vancement, but the resolution was !
modified so as to request the record !
only. The first vote was on, a motion â 
made by Senator Hale to lay the reso- i
lution on the table, and on this the |
ayes and noes were taken, resulting :J
Ayes 27, noes 35. The resolution was!
then allowed to pass without further i
division.
For three hours previous to this, how- !
ever, the Senate had been engaged In a I
very animated verbal battle, which in- i
volved many intricacies and was partici- :
pated in by a large number of Senators. I
The main contests were first over the
general policy of promoting these officers !
over others who were characterized as I
quits as deserving, though less fortunate,
in that they were deprived of such active
participation in the war, and, second, as
to the relative merits of Sampson and
Schley.
Senators Gorman and Wellington of
Maryland, one a Republican and the other
a Democrat, united in a fierce attack upon
the Navy Department for favoring Samp
son over Schley, while Senators Lindsay
l't'ttlgrew, Perkins and Money attacked
the whole system of promotion as "a
species of favoritism which was not war
ranted by the facts."
The method of the administration was
defended by Messrs. Hale, Chandler and
Lodge. Senator Wellington was especially
zealous in his advocacy of the claims of
Admiral Schley, and in his presentation
of reasons why Admiral Sampson should j
not be preferred over Schley, he and hia
Democratic colleague, Gorman, made the
statement that if the otEcial papers were
ordered they would demonstrate beyond |
a possible question the fact that Schley j
and not Sampson fought the battle of
Santiago. They contended that with
Sampson ten miles away he could not be
accredited constructively with having
command of the fleet on the memorable
day when these vessels were sent to the j
bottom. On the contrary, they held that
Schley was on the ground; he was the
senior officer, and that he was engaged
actively and most effectively in the con
flict all the world knew, regardless of the
favors of the Government at Washington.
Senator Lindsay found much in the pro
motion of both Schley and Sampson over
Commodore Watson to condemn. He took
occasion to praise Watson as a man who
undoubtedly would have made a line
record in the war if given the opportunity
he should have had as senior officer, and
said that to deprive him of his rightful
rank while other men were pressed to the
front and were given the posts of honor
was in every way unfair and unworthy
of a great country. Senator Perkins,
Senator Platt of Connecticut and Senator i
Pettigrew also criticized the system as
one liable to result in unfairness unless I

day the different phases of the Suisun

very cautiously entered upon, agreeing
that at any rate the Senate should have
the record, that It might decide for Itself
as to the merits of the men so signally
favored compared with those who had re
ceived none of the loaves and fishes.
Senators Hale and Chandler, both mem
bers of the Naval Committee, defended
the action of the Navy Department in giv
ing preference to the men who took upon
themselves the brunt of the battle In At
lantic waters and in preferring the man
who was in command of the iieet. They
deprecated the opening of the controversy
which Senator Chandler said might lead
to a condition which might prove as un
savory as that which the war investigat
ing commission had developed in connec
tion with the army beef contracts. Sena
tor Lodge joined in deploring this policy,
and, owing to the fact that he had been
recently in the interest of private re
search and made an exhaustive investi
gation, he was enabled to throw much
light upon the controversy in behalf of the
contention that the controversy should not
be stirred.
During the presentation of this side
j much was said in upholding the claims of
i Sampson in preference to those of Schley,
J and the friends of the latter officer were
I warned that if they insisted upon press
j ins the investigation too closely, some
facts would be developed that would not
i be agreeable to them.
tThe charge was made that Schley had
>luntarily left Santiago after reaching
c vicinity of that port and after Cervera
id entered the harbor, and also the
large that when the Spanish fleet had
tiled out through the narrow mouth of
ie channel Admiral (then Commodore) i
?hley had- made a reverse movement
with the Brooklyn and gone in a direction
opposite to that taken by the Spanish
squadron, instead of boldly attacking the
enemy in the beginning. It was asserted
that these facts were among those which
the archives would reveal.
The friends of Admiral Schley declared
they had nothing to fear from having all
the facts known. Explaining his start to
leave Santiago and his refusal to obey de
partment orders before Sampson's arri
val, they said that it was because he had
been unable to coal at sea. When they
were asked how it happened that he had
been able to coal thirty-sLs hours after
ward, they replied that this was due to
the fact that a storm had given place to
Senators Lindsay and Pettigrew, who
were not standing for either Sampson or
Schley, made the point that these devel
opments had merely emphasized the rea
sons why the Senate should be put Into
possession of all the facts before voting.
"I am not the champion of either of
these officers," said Mr. Pettigrew, "and
if Schley ran away from the enemy or
showed a disposition to do so, I want to
know it."
After the decision to send for the rec
ords was arrived at,, there was a general
understanding that the whole matter
should be postponed long enough to per
mit action by both houses upon the Ne
val Committee's bill providing that these
promotions "shall not interfere with the
promotion of officers otherwise entitled
to promotion."
The subsequent effort of the Senate In
open session to pass this bill was the re
sult of the agreement.
During the debate the fact was brought
out that Captain Higginson of the Mas-
I sachusetts had already been promoted to
fill Schley's place as commodore, and the
criticism was made that this action was ir
regular, but Senator Hoar defended
' the promotion, and called attention to the
fact that Schley had been placed in a
precisely similar predicament when he
was made commodore to succeed Com
modore Quackenbush, who was dismissed
and afterward reinstated.
Important testimony will be adduced
showing that Mrs. Daniel Wilson was
aware of her former husband's inten
tions to deed his orchard property to j
Mrs. Virgie O'Brien, a woman with
whom Wilson was infatuated. At the
inquest Mrs. Wilson denied this, but
her son, Dannie Wilson, testified that
he himself had informed his mother of
his father's intentions. Thus a motive
for the crime is established.
Evidence will be given showing
"Squeaky" Wilson's intentions to deed
his property to Mrs. O'Brien had been
discussed by the Wilson family and by
certain members denounced in such a
manner as to prompt malicious action.
When Mrs. Wilson was legally sepa
rated from her husband she was award
ed one-half of the community property.
This did not last the woman long, her
habits being extravagant. At the time
Wilson was murdered Mrs. Wilson was
in dire straits.
Another link of evidence is from a
witness who said Wilson had once
shown him a threatening letter he re
ceived from a person who evidently
was opposed to the manner in which
the man was conducting himself with
certain women on his ranch.
New witnesses have been subpenaed
during the last two or three days whose
testimony will greatly strengthen the
prosecution's case. Miller has not
heard of' the officers' latest acquisition
and seems to think he can establish an
alibi. Under Sheriff Robinson has
stated that he has discovered additional
evidence in support of his contentions
regarding the gun which he secured on
the McEwen ranch last week. Twenty
one witnesses will be called for the
prosecution and eight witnesses for the
defense.

FRANCISCO IN
A BIG HURRY
TO BE MARRIED
His Beloved Occupies
a Cheerless Cell.
SHE SAYS HE WAS "SOFT"
MISS ALICE MOSS TOOK HIS GOOD
GOLD.
New She Declines to Become His
Wife and the Old Man De
clares He WaÂ»
Bunkoed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway. Jan. 23.
Miss Alice Mops, a young woman of
attractive manners hut very ordinary fea
tures, was arrested this morning because
Mnnuol Francisco believes he was bun
koed by her out of $50. Manuel's own
story would make it appear that al
though he was bunkoed it was more the
result of his own loveslokness than of
any scheme on the part of the woman.
Manuel says that the young woman
won his afiVotion the first time he saw
her. Manuel is old enough to be the fath
er of Miss Moss, vith a few years to
spare; but his experience did not render
him proof against the attractions of the
young woman. He met her some weeks
ago. while she was nursing a sick friend
at the Henry House on Ninth street.
Francisco visited the friend and lost his
heart to the nurse. Xfter a little time
he mustered up sufficient courage to pro
pose a walk, then a supper, then the
theater and then matrimony. He says his
efforts were so successful that Alice
promised to marry him any time he
might desire.
Just about a year ago Francisco was
divorced from one wife, and he has been
anxiously counting the months until he
should be legally able to marry again.
The time has just expired, and on Satur
day last Francisco informed Miss Moss
that he was going to the County Clerk
for the necessary license.
The young woman, according to Fran
oisco. was so elated over the prospects of
marriage that she was given about $50 by
him with which to purchase feathers, a
cloak and hat and other things which a
bride-elect is supposed to possess.
Everything went smoothly until the
marriage license was mentioned. Then
Miss Moss said many cruel things to Fran
ciscu. She told him she did not love him;
that she had never loved him: never could
love him; had no desire to love him: in
fact she didn't even have enough regard
for him to return the $".0. which he says
he gave her as a consideration for the
contract to live for and love each other
â¢until death >>r divorce.
When satisfied that Alice was in earn
est Francisco swore out a warrant and
Miss Moss was taken to a horrid cell at
the City Prison.
Miss Moss will not talk. She says that
Francisco did give her money, but did it
voluntarily and as a present. She is posi
tive that she gave him no reason to ex
pect anything in return. Her little story
of innocence and of her receipt of money
&% a gift compares very favorably with
that of another Oaklander recently told
to a legislative committee.
One of her remarks, however, cuts
Francisco very deeply. She says that she
knew him to be "soft" and so she just let
him give her the money because if she
had not taken it he would have given it
to some other woman. In the Police Court
to-morrow Judge Smith will have to lis
ten to this tale of coin and love and de
cide whether the $50 was a gift or a con
sideration.
AN ATTORNEY
FAVORS JAIL
FOR DEBTORS
Judge Greene Gives
Him a Scoring.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 23.
Judge GreenÂ© has discovered one attor
ney who highly approves of the proposed
new law by which Imprisonment would be
a possibility for contempt of court in the
matter of paying bills. O. Q. Heaton was
In the Superior Court this morning, and
gave the Judge a surprise, but in return
he no doubt received a greater one.
Heaton was trying to collect some ali
mony on behalf of Mrs. Sarah Freeman,
who was divorced from her husband sev
eral months ago. Mrs. Freeman has fig
ured in much litigation, one of her suits
being for $10,000 against a woman whom
$he claimed alienated her husband's af
fections. In the decree of divorce Mrs.
Freeman is granted $25 per month ali
mony, but although many months have
passed 6he has only been able to collect
$65 in all. Now she Is threatened with
eviction, as her rent is not paid, and she
has received notice to vacate next month.
But although Mrs. Freeman and her
children are in a bad plight, Judge Green
does not believe in having his court mac
an agency for the collection of legitimat
debts or for the collection of debts b
means not sanctioned by law. In th
testimony a Mr. Kenny was put on th
Btand. who testified that Heaton in a care
less, confidential moment had confided t
him the fact that if he (Heaton) could se
cure the commitment to jail of Freema
for contempt of court, in not paying al
mony, there is a woman living somewher
who would put up money for Freeman
release. The name of the woman wa
not mentioned, but it is guessed that it
Is the lady who figured so prominently in
the divorce proceedings and in the many
sensational incidents leading up to them.
â¢ After Kenny had Given his testimony
Judge Greene, in his usual stentorian tons,
asked Heaton what he had to say.to which
the attorney replied that he would like
Mr. Freeman punished for contempt of
court.
Judge Greene looked over the top of his
desk, and, fixing his eyes squarely on
Heaton for what seemed like ten minutes,
Bald: "Young man, we don't do that kind
of business in this court. The case is
dismissed. You cannot use this court
to put a man In jail under such circum
stances. You have begun this kind of
practice very young, and I would advise
you to make a change."
It was shown during the testimony that
Freeman has earned $550 during the past
year, and Mrs. Freeman declared her in
tention of taking steps to have him ar
rested for failing t- provide for his minor
children.
GIVE UP HOPE.
Relatives of the Missing Boys Aban-
don Themselves to Despair.
BERKELEY, Jan. 23.â 1t seems conclu
sive now that William Seabury and Ed
ward Finn, who went duck hunting last
Friday morning, have met with an acci
dent which cost thorn their lives. T'p to
a late hour to-night no trace whatever
had been heard from them, and no clew
can be started which promises any solu
tion of the mystery of their disappear
ance The ill-fated attempt of yesterday
to send out a search party in quest of the
two boys was repeated to-day but with
no successful buteome. The families of
the younÂ« hunters have accepted the sad
conclusion as inevitable, and nothing fur
ther will be done in searching. for them.
The tugboat McNear started out tnls
morning with a party on board to explore
the marsh lands on the bay snore
for the last time. Two men comprised
the partyâ Joseph Matthews, one of the

WILL OF F. J. FLETTEB.
Valuable Estate Equally Divided
Among the Widow and the
Children.
OAKLAND. Jan. 23.â The will of Free
born J. Fletter, who died suddenly in
Alameda last week, was filed to-day for
probate. The instrument is typewritten,
dated February 26, 189S, and names the
widow. Augusta T. Fletter, a son, Charles
F. Fletter, and J. P. Wallace, executors as
well as trustees of the estate. The peti
tion filed to-day by the last three named
formally values the estate to exceed
$10,000. It Is believed to be worth between
$100,000 and $200,000.
According to the pro-visions of the will,
the trustees are given full power to sell,
mortgage or dispose of the real property
as may seem to the best interests of the
estate. One-fourth is bequeathed to the
widow, and the other three-fourths to the
three sons, Charles F., aged 24 years;
Oliver W. and Wallace T. Fletter, the
latter two minors. Provision is made for
the education of these minors, and at the
age of 25 years the sons are to receive
one-half of their legacy, the remainder
to be paid when they reach the age of
30 years. However, when Charles F.
Fletter is doled out his one-half share,
$10,000 is to be deducted, as this amount
was advanced to him by the testator dur
ing life.
OAKLAND IS FULLY
ASSURED CHEAP GAS
NOT TO EXCEED $1 PER THOU
SAND.
If the Price Is Increased the Com
pany Will Forfeit Its
License.
An article that appeared In The Call of
yesterday with reference to the policy
and obligations of the recently organized
Equitable Gas Company of Oakland may
have been misleading. The theory was
that at the expiration of a stated term of
three years the company might be in a
position to enter into a combination with
:i rival company and advance the price
at pleasure beyond the figure of $1 per
thousand feet named in the franchise.
All of which would be in accordance with
the past history of gas and water cor
porations.
William G. Henshaw, treasurer of the
Equitable Gas Company, is authority for
the statement that by reason of the
license it holds from the owner of the
patent, the price of $1 per thousand can
not be exceeded by his company without
the forfeiture of its license. This restric
tion applies also to the Equitable Com
pany of San Francisco. In this connec
tion the following statement made by J.
W. Chisholm, vice president of the
Equitable Gas Light Company, will be
read with particular satisfaction by the
people of this city and Oakland. Mr.
Chisholm says:
I am the owner for the State of California of
all rights under the patent for the "Hall Pro
cess" of manufacturing gas, and have granted
to the Oakland Equitable Gas Company the
license to manufacture the gas under said pro
cess.
The license to that company Is In terms
similar to the license of the San Francisco
Equitable Gaslight Company, and each of said
licenses contains a clause, under a penalty of
forfeiture thereof, that "the price of gas to be
furnished by said company shall not at any
time nor under any circumstances exceed $1
per 1000 cubic feet."
It will be the policy of all the companies
manufacturing gas under the "Hall Process" to
furnish it to the consumers at the lowest possi
ble orice, but in no event can the price any
where within this State exceed $1 per 1000 cubic
feet, without the company which attempted to
get a higher price forfeiting its license to me.
Mr. Henshaw states that the people of
Oakland will be given the benefit of the
cheap gas at the earliest possible date.
Construction of the works will begin
within the next thirty days.
PRIMARIES AND PROXIES.
Stormy Meeting of the Democratic
City Central Committee.
OAKLAND, Jan. 23.â The Democratic
City Central Committee met to-night and
the deadlock over the election of a com
mitteeman from the Seventh Ward was
broken. O. C. Kirk was elected over
Frank W. Trower. This vote showed that
the Fitzgerald wing was in the minority,
and that the old organization, or Lay
mance division, was in control.
The meeting was stormy from the start.
For several days the old faction has been
at work to capture the organization, and
to-night it demonstrated its success.
Chairman McDonough realized his di
lemma, and did his best under the cir
cumstances, but everything was against
him. There was trouble over everything,
but the prevalence of proxies caused the
liveliest scrimmage. R. M. Fitzgerald and
W. H. High represent the aristocratic
Fifth Ward. Neither was present at the
meeting, but â¢ each gave a proxy with
"full power to act." J. Smith held High's
proxy, while Chairman McDonough rep
resented Fitzgerald. Smith is a Lay
mance man, and the absentees from the
Fifth caused all the trouble.
Smith Introduced a resolution provid
ing that the committeemen from each
ward appoint three men, whose duty it
shall be to appoint twenty-one delegates,
making a convention of 147 delegates.
Chairman McDonough declined to vote,
saying he favored primaries. The oppo
sition declared that primaries without a
law were a stench in the nostrils of all
good Democrats. After a protracted ar
gument the resolution went through.
Smith then proposed a resolution that
the committeemen at once name the nom
inating committee of twenty-one. This
brought the storm to a climax. McDon
ough said he could not, with decency, act ]
for Fitzgerald on such an important mat- !
ter, and wanted to adjourn till to-mor- j
row night. Although the resolution was ;
passed. McDonough declined to vote for
himself or Fitzgerald or McDonald,
whose proxies he held. On a motion to
adjourn, however, the chairman decided
he could vote. This brought on a squall,
and finally tne meeting was adjourned till
Tuesday night.
J. L. SHERMAN INDICTED.
I Grand Jury Acts on the Case of the
Man Who Was Charged With
Embezzlement.
OAKLAND. Jan. 23.â The Grand Jury
to-day filed an indictment charging John
L. Sherman with grand larceny. Sher
man was recently convicted of embez
zling fciOO from a widow, Mrs. Lizzie
Small, but the verdict was set aside. It \
was then proposed to change the charge
to one of obtaining money by false pre
tenses. However, the Grand Jury has
been investigating the case and to-day
indicted Sherman. His bail is fixed at
$2000.
The Grand Jury also inquired into the
letting of a contract by the Supervisors to
Devlin & Devlin to bring suit in the name
of this county against the State Treas
urer for commissions from State taxes;
which contract the Supervisors may yet
rescind. Everything was found satisfac
tory.

GRANT'S MONEY
WENT TO
WRIGHT
Continued from Fourth Page.
around I can do so." So far as myself
was concerned I canvassed â I went to
Yreka a couple of times during the cam
paign, but 1 went on business as much
and more than electioneering. The Sat
urday before the election Major Myers
wrote me that they were going to have a
big whoop-up at Fort JonÂ£s and he wished
that I would go over. 1 spent a little
money at Yreka and I spent a little money
around my own precinct, but that is all
the electioneering that I did. And what
money I had was put out for the general
benefit of the ticket.
y. And for the general ticket?
A. "Well, more particularly for Mr. Gage,
Mr. Van Fleet, Mr. Edson and Mr. Laird.
Q. Did you know at the time that you
got this money whose it was?
A. 1 did not.
Q. Have you learned sinco?
A. I have not, no.
Q. Did you use that money to assist in
electing a portion of the legislative
ticket?
A. Well, if you confine it to Mr. Laird,
I worked for Mr. Laird's interests.
Q. How much of that money, if any,
(Ihi you contribute toward the election of
Mr. Laird and yourself.
A. Not any toward myself, sir.
Q. Well, Mr. Laird.
A. Mr. Laird 1 do not know. I placed
the money around in various places and
worked for Mr. Laird"s interests and for
the interests of the ticket at large.
Q. Did you segregate the nortion that
you applied to the election of Mr. Laird
from that of the election of the general
ticket, as you have named it? ,
A. No, I did not. I had $400.
Q. In that election of yours did you ex
press, directly or indirectly, expressly or
impliedly, a promise to vote for Mr.
Grant?
A. I did not.
Q. In spending this money for Mr.
Laird, did you, in person or by agent, ex
pressly or impliedly, or otherwise secure
from Mr. Laird a promise or an under
standing, express or Implied, that lie
should vote for Mr. Grant.
A. 1 did not.
Q. You left the persons that you ex
ponded that money for, then, absolutely
free to use thoir judgment in any man
ner that they say fit?
A. I never consulted them as to the
money at all. I never consulted Mr.
Laird.
Q. Did you give it to candidates them
selves in person, or to agents of your
own who should distribute it under your
direction?
A. Agents of my own.
Q. And in the instructions to those
agents, did you instruct them to secure
from Mr. I-aird any understanding that
he should vote for Mr. Grant or any oth
er Senatorial candidate?
A. I did not.
The chairmanâ Any other matters, gen
tlemen? If not, you will be excused.
Chairman Cosper read an affidavit
from Charles G. Lamberson of Vlsalia
to the effect that he was engaged in an
important case in court and could not
attend on the committee until Wednes
day.
The chairman â I think our sessions
will be open here until Mr. Lamberson
comes. But it looks to me as though
we were coming toward the close, and
that is the reason why I say what I do.
Mr. Melllck â I have prepared a state
ment, which I will offer in the form of a
suggestion: "Resolved, that the in
sinuations against Assemblyman Cos
per have been wholly disproved, and as
the testimony of Mr. Lamberson is only
called for by idle rumor, it is hereby
moved that this committee proceed
as rapidly as possible without the pres
ence of Mr. Lamberson."
After a discussion the motion was
withdrawn by Mr. Mcl lick.
The chairmanâ Gentlemen, we have an
other communication: "San Francisco,
Cal., Jan. 21. 18!Â»9. This is to certify that
Mr. M. H. fie Young has been under my
professional care for the last twelve days
for a severe attack of la grippe. During
the greater portion of this time he was
confined to hi? home and room, at which
place 1 visited him and prescribed for and
treated him several times daily. Al
though improved, I deem it undesirable
and extremely dangerous to his health
and oven a risk to life for him to leave
the city, as it would then be impossible
for him to carry out the treatment still
necessary for his complete restoration to
health. S. S. BOND. M.D." Subscribed
nn<'. sworn to before a notary public.
Ernest Simpsonâ May I speak in behalf
of Mr. dfl Young in this regard?
The chairman â Yes.
Mr. Simpsonâ Mr. de Young, whom I
saw in San Francisco on Saturday night,
risked me to say to you gentlemen that
ho had no desire -to evade your process
nor to avoid testifying before this com
mittee and that if he should be sufficient
ly Improved in health to leave San Fran
cisco before your session was completed
he would surely come forward and answer
any questions that you may see lit to put
to him. He asked me to say also that
lie had read carefully such reports of this
investigation as have been printed in the
daily newspapers and that he did not be
lieve ho had any Information of his own
knowledge which would be of value to
you or to the Legislature in this respect.
Mr. Mellickâ Could not Mr. Simpson be
sworn and asked a couple of questions?
Ernest S. Simpson being sworn testified
as folllows:
The chairmanâ State your name, please.
A. Ernest S. Simpson.
Mr. Mellickâ Mr. Simpson, have you any
knowledge of Speaker Wright having
gone to Mr. Herrin and gotten $800?
A. No, sir.
Q. What do you know about that?
A. Absolutely nothing, except what I
have heard here and read in newspapers;
heard it as a matter of current report.
Q. Were you not present with Mr. de
Young at the time the news was brought
to you in San Francisco?
A. No. sir.
Clerk Wrayâ Mr. Leake testified that
Mr. de Young had told him (Leake) that
Wright had gone to Mr. Herrin and asked
for $1200, or had solicited $1200 from Mr.
Herrin. and had received $800; that that
statement was m;ide by Mr. de Young to
Mr. Lcako in confidence.
The witnessâ lf I may be permitted I
think as to that. Mr. dp Young's informa
tion was merely hearsay, if he did say
such a thing, and 1 gathered from what
he laid to mo that ho had possibly said
such a thing to Mr. Leake, but not as a
matter of which he had personal knowl
edge, but a matter concerning which he
had received more or less reliable infor
mation. That he knew nothing of it of
his own knowledge.
Mr. Mellickâ The reason I asked Mr.
Simpson this at this time is this: At
the time Mr. Leake asked to have Mr. de
\oung subpenaed he said Simpson knew
about this same thing.
The chairmanâ You know nothing?
A. I know nothing.
The chairmanâ Presumably, then, Mr. de
Young knows nothing.
"he chairmanâ You know nothing.

ALAMEDA "DELEGATION
WILL NOT CAUCUS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 23.â The Senators and
Assemblymen comprising the Alameda
delegation held a conference recently
and agreed to entertain no proposition
for a caucus on United States Senator
while the present conditions exist.
This action on the part of the Alameda
delegation was taken in deference to
the wishes of the Grant forces, who
earnestly requested that nothing should
be done to- promote a caucus while
Grant was under fire. It does not fol
low that the Alameda people will con
sent to a caucus after . Grant emerges
from, the ordeal, but they have agreed
to stay out pending the report of the
investigating committee.
To Recognize Homeopathy.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 23.â Assemblyman Cobb of
San Francisco sent a bill into the As
sembly this morning which is destined
to secure representation of the homeo
pathic medical fraternity of San
Francisco on the Board of Health.
The bill provided that three instead
of two visiting physicians, and three
surgeons shall be appointed for the
City and County Hospital, and provides
that one each shall be nominated by the
College of Physicians and Surgeons, one
each by the medical department of the
State University and one each by Cooper
Alemcal College. Under the present law
there are but two physicians and two
surgeons, who are nominated by the State
University and the Medical College of tire
Pacific. The privilege of attending all
clinics is extended to the College of Phy
sicians and Surgeons of San Francisco,
the medical department of the Univer
sity of California, Cooper Medical College
Hahnemann Hospital and the California
Medical College.
To Protect Electric Wires.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 23.â Senator Bulla wishes
to protect telephone wires as well as lines
for long distance electrical transmission.
He has introduced a bill making it a fel
ony to sever any of these wires, punish
able by imprisonment for not exceeding
two years in the penitentiary and a fine
not exceeding $500. Senator Bulla ex
plained that the object of his bill was to
prevent the cutting of wires conveying
electrical power. In Southern California
the cutting of one wire would stop every
street car in and darken Los Angeles, for
15.000 lights would cease to burn. The
bill was intended, he said, to more par
ticularly protect that character of wires.
District of Columbia Day.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â This was Dis

One of the provisions of the bill grants

Hawaiian flag owned by Hawaiian citi
zens July 7, 1898.

W. H. STACKPOLE
COMPLAINS OF
CORONER HILL
Trouble Over Orr's
Remains.
RELATIVES' DEMAND IGNORED
WANTED TO SEND THE BODY TO
PORTLAND, ME.
The Coroner Finally Delivered the
Cadaver to His Undertaking
Priendâ A Replevin Suit
to Follow To-Day.
The- disposition of the body of Frank
E. Orr, who lost his life in the collision
between a launch and the ferry
steamer Oakland, has resulted in a sit
uation that is anything but a credit to
the new administration of the Coro
ner's office. The young' man was a
cousin of W. 11. Stackpole, an attorney
of this city, who is Jn fact the only
relative of the deceased on this coast.
Accompanied by C S. Chamberlain,
With whom the young man had made
his home, Mr. Stackpole went to the
Coroner'a office yesterday morning and
presented a dispatch from the head of
family in Portland, Me., Instruct
ing the Coroner to turn the body of Orr
over to Chamberlain. They were told
that the matter was in the hands of the
Public Administrator. Stackpole stated
that the i-state of the deceased was too
email to make it an object to adminis
ter 'npon it. It was linally stated that
the difficulty would be adjusted after
the jury had viewed the body. The
Public Administrator put no particular
obstacles in the way, but by reason of
the acts of the administrator's attorney
and the Coroner's olHce Stackpole was
kept dancing back and forth between
the Coroner's office and the office of
the Public Administrator until late in
the afternoon. He urged upon Coroner
Hill the importance of having the body
embalmed at once, in order that it
tuight be properly Bhipped East.
"Ruef told me," said Stackpole, "that
while the Public Administrator waived
the right to special letters he thoueht
that the Coroner wanted to give the
patronage to a friend who occasionally
buried bodies from the office free of
eharg*-. Hill again appeared and I
called his attention to the statement
of Ruef. He sale he certainly wanted
to give thi- business to the city under-
tak^r, to whom he "owed everything.'
I told him that Chamberlain was ready
to advance th.- several hundred dollars
required to prepare and forward the
body, and that 1 had had an under
taker with me since morning waiting
.to take thÂ»- remains; that 1 saw no rea
son for the dangerous delay and want
ed prompt action.
"Coroner Hill finally said he had no
.further objection to my claim, but that
i.nrUÃt procure an order from the Pub-
; lie Administrator before he would de
..â '.."liver the body to me. I went to the
office of that gentleman and he would
â  -hot. act until he saw his attorney. He
Bald ho did not pet- what he had to do
with the case, anyhow. After con
: siderable further delay Ruef learned by
telephone that the remains of mv
cousin had been sent to the California
Undertaking Parlors.
. "I presume it is the intention of that
Institution to force me to pay their
price for putting the body in shape to
forward East. However, the Coroner
had no right in these premises, and I
propose to replevin the remains to
morrow morning. To me this conduct
of the Coroner sterns scandalous, and
I firmly believe it was a matter of com
mission. In my view of the case, the
body nf my relative was made a bone
of contention and hawked about be
tween the Coroner's office and an un
dertaking establishment. I consider it
a disgrace to the Coroner and an out
rage of the feelings of the relatives
and friends nf the dead man."
DUE TO A LIGHTED CIGARETTE.
T. A. Riordan, a Young Man, Se
verely Injured in a Gas Explosion.
T. A. Riordan, an employe of the new
g-as company, was seriously injured yes
terday afternoon by a gas explosion. Ri
ordan and several assistants were sent
to Stockton street, between Sutter and
Post, to make a connection with the
g&s main. By the time they had reached
the spot on excavation had been dug so
as to allow them to make the connection.
Kiordan, who is an expert gas fitter, en
tered the excavation and at once proceed
ed to tap the main pipe. There were a
number of people present, y.-ho were at
tracted to the scene by idle curiosity.
One of them was smoking a cigarette, arid
It is supposed that he accidentally drop
ped it in the pit. The next Instant there
wan an explosion, and as a sheet of
flame shot upward Riordan was seen
crawling out of the excavation. His face
and hands were badly burned, and as he
emerged from the pit he was at once
ff-izca by the assistants, who took him to
a drug store a short distance away.
As it was feared that he was fatally
burned, his friends subsequently had
him removed to the Receiving Hospital
Police Surgeon Weil applied the usual
remedies and then had the injured man
taken to his home.
To a reporter Riordan said he was In
the act of making the connection when
the explosion occurred.
"After I had entered the excavation,"
he remarked, "I noticed a man smoking
a cigar.-tt.;. and called his attention to
the danger. Thinking he would throw
away the cigarette, I paid no further at
tention to him, and proceeded to make
the connection. The usual amount of
gas was escaping from the pipe, and as I
called to one of my assistants to keep
the crowd back, there was an explosion
and I found myself hurled against thÂ«
Fide pf the excavation. After considerable
effort I crawled out of the pit and was as
PiKtod to a drug store and from there'sent
to the Receiving Hospital."
Riordan believes that the straneer
whom he had requested to stop smokTnÂ»
accidentally dropped the lighted cigar
ette into the excavation, with the result
that the explosion followed. U

He Was Not a Highbinder.
T,oule Lee, who was arrested Sunday
night on Washington street for battery
upon Hong Sing, a member of the Chi
nese Educational Society, appeared be
fore Judge Mogan yesterday. He proved
that he was a cook at 2327 Buchanan
street and had no connection with any
hlbghblnder society. He happened to
jostle against the complaining witness,
but did not know anything about the two
other men. who were supposed to be high
binders. The Judge fined him $10, and as
he could not pay the fine he was ordered
into custody.
A NEW RAISIN GRAPE.
California's Viticulture Increased by
a Product From Chile.
California Is soon to have a valuable
raisin producing vine added to her al
ready varied viticultural products. It is
known as the Huasco grape, and comes
from the Huasco Valley or District in
Chile. When J. A. Filcher, manager of
the State Board of Trade, was at .the
World's Fair in Chicago he saw an ex
hibit of those raisins and with several
other Californians, was much pleased
with their appearance. The raisin is as
large as the product of a muscat, and is
of a beautiful light color, an almost
transparent white, and tlie scarcity of
seeds mnkes it a very marketable article.
When cured without artificial means it
looks and tastes like a glace fruit.
Three years ago Mr. Filcher wrote to
several of the United States Consuls in
! Chile, asking them to send cuttings of
the vine, but nothing came of the corre
spondence until yesterday, when a letter
was delivered to him by Captain Thomas
Motley of the British ship Wallacetown.
which arrived recently from the south
-1 em coast and Is now at the Oakland long
i wharf. The letter was from Andrew Kerr,
! the present Consul at Coquimbo, Chili.
I who stated that the letter sent to Consul
J. M. Dobbs several years ago had been
! given to him to answer. The answer was
' that there were about 100 cuttings of the
' much desired vine on the Wallacetown.
Mr. Filcher has sent the cuttings to a
vineyardist at Auburn, and as soon na
the time is ripe cuttings will be distrib
uted by the State Board of Trade.
ON ASPHALT COURTS.

Tennis Players Out Again.
Now that the storm has blown over and
the sun shines once more, the lawn ten

discharge from the First California Vol
unteers on account of ill health. He Is

days, among them bring Misses Eckert,
Bowman. Clarke. Mlddleton, Chese

A special event will probably be ar

details of whi<'h will be piven later.
TOOK JEWELRY AND COIN.
Morris Windt's Residence on San
Bruno Avenue Entered by a Thief.
A thief entered the residence of Morris
Windt, the tanner, at 1424 San Bruno ave
nue, on Sunday evening while the family
was at dinner, and managed to get away
with quite a haul in money and' jewelry.
The thief had a good knowledge of the
house and its contents, as he went direct
to where the valuables were and took such
articles as were easily secreted on his per
son. He took an excellent pair of diamond
earrings.. a diamond pin and a lady's gold
watch and chain, belonging to Mrs.
Windt; a heavy gold chain belonging to
Mr. Windt, and $60 in money.
The police were notified, and after mak
ing an examination of the premises ar
rested the Japanese servant pending fur
ther developments. No charge has been
entered against him. He is held on sus
picion.
The value of the property taken is rated
at over 5700, as the diamonds were of good
value, and the watch, which was a birth
day present from husband to wife, cost
over $150.
TURNER WAS LIBELED.

Hearst of the Examiner.
For the second , time John W. Turner,
an attorney of Eureka, Humboldt County, :
has been awarded damages in his ac- I

ncr sued for damages, and a jury award- j
ed him a judgment of $500. The judg- j
ment was reversed by the Supreme Court,
however, and the case was remanded for
a new trial.

Daingerfield yesterday morning, was sub- I
mitted shortly after 3 p. m.. and an hour
later the jury awarded Turner a verdict
of $150.

Mrs. Grace Allison, indicted for using the
mails for the purpose of defrauding gul
lible country people who n. ort to matri
monial bureaus, was called in the United
States District Court yesterday and was

sence of H. C. Franks, a defaulting wit
ness, who is believed to have been
"shooed" off. It was stated that Franks

Franks and hold him as a defaulting wit
ness until an officer can be sent for him
from this city.

the name was on hand last night to see
them in the new costumes and capers
of "The Wizard of the Nile." From
Ned Greenway in the frontest row.
smiling enough to swallow the trom
bone, to Ward McAllister in a box for
getting to be bored for fully fifteen
consecutive minutes, it was a grand,
glad night. The girls' were .at their
loveliest, ' Daniels at his funniest, colors
were bright and costumes gay, the
bard played on and everybody except
a stray Shakespearean student or two
from the press had a gorgeous time.
Just why they had a gorgeous time is
even harder to answer this week than
it was last. Perhaps it was the flippant
music, perhaps the gaudy robes and
scenery, perhaps the condensed comi
cality of the star, or, what is more
likely, the swing and swish and spell
of the girls. Whatever the cause the
show was a success. Before It com
menced you could see that it was going
to be a success, lor the crowd came
with its mind made up.
"The Wizard of the Nile," which was
written by Victor Herbert and Harry
B. Smith, makes about the same great
drain on your analytical powers as did
these gentlemen's masterpiece of last
week, "The Idol's Eye." The plot is
carefully guarded by jokes and com
plicated stage business and the serious
music invariably concealed by absence.
Horseplay, girl-gambol, silks, scenery,
props and jingle are whipped to the
very froth of nonsense, out of which
perpetually bubbles the funny little
personality of Frank Daniels.
This time Mr. Daniels is a Persian
magician by the fatal name of Kibosh,
who visits Egypt in that remote period
which knew Queen Cleopatra as aguile

veloping those ardent qualities which
afterward m;ide her famous; she al
most ran away with her music teacher,

tional tremolo.

the land, and Cleopatra's papa., Ptol

magician who can conjure up a flood.
Kibosh stands in the way of being kill

magic passes, which cause several eggs
to appear at the indignant lips of
Ptolemy and also -an overflow of the
Nile, such an overflow that the good
King and his court are driven to the
tops of the pyramids to keep their san
dals dry.
I shall not trifle further with . the
mysteries of the plot. As Kibosh, Mr.

as funny in just the same way. Alf C.

Orpheum.
Not since Black Pattl's Troubadours
has the town seen a coon show as
tropical as the one now play
ing 1 at the Orpheum under the
name of "Clorindy, or the Ori
gin of the Cake Walk." The Bkit is
called a rag-time opera and the com
pany numbers thirty dusky dancers
and singers, who are not colored but
born that way. They sing their orig
inal song, "Darktown Is Out To-night,"
which we have heard only feebly pi
rated by other rag specialists, and a
"Chicken" song, a real rag-timer of
real dusky syncopation, to say nothing
of half a dozen others of sentimental
and breakdown variety. The liveliest
feature of "Clorindy" is the concluding
cakewalk, in which the whole company
takes part.
Papinta, who has made a record hit
in her illuminated dances, is in her last
week, and the rest of the bill is well up
to the average.
California.
General Shafter. the hero of Santiago,
received a popular ovation last night at j
the California Theater that must have I
pleased him even more than the formal j
reception accorded him a few evenings
ago.
"A Contented Woman" Is one of Hoyt's
cleverest satires, and the company that
played it last night is one of the cleverest '
that has been seen here for d long time, j
Belle Archer, the Grace Holme of the j
play, is a fine looking figure and knows it.
She also lets the spectators know that
she knows it. This is the only draw
back; but she dresses harmoniously and
acts well, barring the self-conscious
strain.
Henrietta Lee, the Mrs. Ebbsmith of
the play, received the larger share of the
honors last night. She is a handsome wo
man with a good figure, and gives to the
role all the snap and abandon that
make it even more popular than that of
the heroine.
Mrs. Fanny Denham Rouse as Aunt
Jim, and Arthur Gregory as Uncle Tody,
treated the audience to an excellent bit of . I

morning at St. Luke's Church. Rev.
R. C. Foute, rector of Grace Church,
will be masterof ceremonies. Bishop
Tikhon of "the Graeco-Russian
Church with four attendant priests,
will be present, and all the clergy
men of the Episcopal denomination
will assist.
Last night at St. Luke's Church
services of intercession for Sunday
schools were held. Short addresses
were made by the Lord Bishop of
Columbia, Rev. H. L. Duhring of
Philadelphia and Rev. William Hall
Moreland. Representatives from
all the Episcopal Sunday-schools of
the city were present and received
some excellent advice in regard to
the ennobling of their work, which
was described as a life vocation.
As the Rev. Mr. Duhring aptly ex
pressed it, "They were engaged not
in the lower blessedness of receiv
ing, but in the higher blessedness
of giving."
being Bide splitting without infringing
on the probabilities. The variety busi
ness introduced into the comedy is first
class, led by Miss Bonnie Lott"ie, whose
songs and dances called forth encore af
ttr encore. Her singing of 'Tf I Can't
Have the Drink That Pa Had Yesterday I
Don't Want Any Drink at All," was
fetching, and her acrobatic dancing was
a revelation of black stockings coming
just below the knee and meeting flesh
colored tights and lace lingerie.
All the characters are good. The play
could not have been better suited to the
cast nor the cast to the play than it is in
the present company. It should draw
great houses.
New Comedy.
The familiar comedy drama "Tennes
see's Pardner" was presented at the New
Comedy Theater last night by Arthur C.
Alston's company to a crowded house. It
has lost none of its attractiveness. The
company is well balanced.
Alcazar.
Belasco's "Men and Women" filled the
Alcazar Theater last evening, and the
comments of thos* who attended, as they
left the place, showed that all were
greatly pleased. Special mention is due
to Miss Adelaide Fitzallen, who for the
first time since her engagement in this
city has had a part in which *.he could
appear to advantage. Miss Laiira Crews
was placed %n a comnaratively new role
last evening. In which she showed that
she is capable of something stronger than
"little gir!'- parts. The efforts of Ernest
Hastings, George Osbourne, Prank Denl
thorne, Clarence Montaine and Howard
Scott showed that they appreciated the
work they had in hand.
Tivoli.
"The Wedding Day" is a new and
lively comic opera that (Its the Tivoli

it is making a steadily increasing run.
Ed Stevens' song about the maids of
various nationalities, with characteris

Morosco's in Oakland.
Oaklanders have in prospect a two
weeks' engagement of the Morosco
Company in plays picked from the sea
son's successes at the home house.
"Trilby" was the opening bill at the
Dewey Theater last nigrht, and its re
ception augurs a prosperous fortnight
across the bay. "Held by the Enemy"
will also be given this week.
Chutes.
Weston and Herbert, who have the
largest assortment of unique musical
j instruments ever played upon in this
! city, made a great hit at the Chutes
! Free Theater last evening. Pianka ap
peared with four performing lions, and
the rest of the bill was well received by
a crowded house. William F. Sapp, the

WOULD ESCAPE
A LIFE IN
DURANCE VILE
Mrs. Botkin Asks for
a New Trial.
MANY GROUNDS SET FORTH
THE JURY AND COURT ALIKE
WEBE IN ERROR.
The Matter of Jurisdiction Is Touch
ed Upon and It Is Alleged
That New Evidence Has
Been Discovered.
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin, stoical, aa usual,
her eyes half closed, her lips pale and
compressed, sat before Judge Cook yes
terday morning while her counsel plead
ed with the court to grant her a new
trial, to give her another chance to
prove that sho it what she pretends to
beâ an outraged woman, persecuted by
her enemies, not a murderess destitute
of feeling or conscience. Her case was
called before Judge Cook at the opening
of the morning session.
Attorney Knight immediately moved for
a new trial, and handed a bill of excep
tions to the judgment of the court to
the clerk, which was ordered submitted.
After the matter of the bill of excep
tions had been formally accepted, Knight
stated to the court that he wished more
time in which to prepare and tile affidav
its in support of his motion for a new
trial. Would the court grant a stay of
proceedings until Saturday? asked Mr.
Knight. At this point District Attorney
Murphy arose and inquired how long it
would take to put the affidavits in shape
for presentment. Judge Cook ended the
debate by granting the motion for a
stay, and the incident was closed. In
care of her sister, Mrs. Dora Brown, and
in charge of a Deputy Sheriff, Mrs. Bot
kin tripped from the courtroom to return
to her cneerless cell in the Branch County
Jail. _ .
Summarized, the grounds upon which
the defense seeks a new trial are these:
The verdict Is contrary to law.
The verdict Is contrary to the evidence.
The court misdirected the Jury as to matters
of law.
The Jury received and considered evidence out
of court other than and not resulting from a
view of the premises.
The Jury was guilty of misconduct, by which
a fair and impartial consideration of the case
was prevented.
The verdict was decided by means other than
a fair expression of opinion on the part 01 all
the Jurors.
The court erred in the decision of questions
of law arising during the trial of the case.
New evidence has been discovered by the de
fendant material to the case, and -which could
not. with reasonable diligence, have been dis
covered and produced at the trial.
The court has no Jurisdiction or power to try
the defendant for the crime charged in the in
dictment or to render judgment upon the ver
dict.
The evidence proved and established that the
defendant did not commit the crime of murder
or kill Mrs. Elizabeth Dunning, nor did the
dnfendant have any part in such alleged crime.
The crime was committed In the State of
Delaware and not In the State of California,
and the defendant was deprived of her right of
trial by a Jury of the State or county or dis
trict where the alleged crime of murder was
committed. j
There is no law of the State of California
under which the crime of murder committed
out of the State of California is made a crime
within the State of California.
The Indictment of the defendant was In vio
lation of article 3, section 2 of the Constitution
of the United States, which provides that "the
trial of all crimes Fhall he by Jury, and that
Fuch trial shall be held in the State where the
crimes shall have been commlttted."
For the alleged crime of murder and killing
by means of poisnn in the State of Delaware
the defendant could not be tried or convicted
except by an impartial Jury of the State of
Delaware.
Wherefore the defendant asks the court to get
aside the verdlrt of guilty of murder heretofore
rendered against her, to grant her a new trial
of said criminal charge in order that the in
dictment be dismissed and she released from
custody.
The document bears the signature of
the prisoner, and bears date of January
23, 1899. Whether or not it will result
in a new trial and the ultimate freeing
of the condemned murderess rests with
Judge Cook. Pending his decision, the
fair prisoner will remain in her cell and
hope for the best.
HE LEFT NO FUNDS
TO BE LEVIED ON
Capitalist Wells Deser.s His Young
Bride, Leaving Her Perniless
Away From Home.
Mrs. Bertha V. Wells, the six-day bride
of Thomas J. Wells, the aged Chicago
capitalist, has taken heroic measures to
secure some solace for her wounded
heart.
She sued out an attachment yesterday
in the sum of $3000 against money she
supposed he had on deposit at the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank. A Deputy
Sheriff hastened there to levy on the
money, but was met with the answer that
no funds were on deposit in the bank in
the name of Mr. Wells.
The husband is supposed to have started
for Chicago, taking with him all the
wearing apparel of his young bride.
An Unhappy Marriage.
Albert Ryder, a teamster, was arrested
January 2 on complaint of Lizzie O'Con
nor, 45 Jessie street, for betrayal under
promise of marriage. Two days after
ward he married the girl, and Judge
Graham dismissed the charge against
him. Sunday he was arrested on com
plaint of his mother-in-law on the charges
of disturbing the peace and vagrancy.
The cases were called before Judge Tread
well yesterday, and Mrs. Harkins, <he
mother-in-law, testified that since the
marriage Ryder had been living with Mrs.
Alma Donnadieu at 28 First street, who
had been engaged to be married to him.
He refused to live with his wife and was
constantly annoying her. The Judge dis
missed the charges, but warned Ryder to
keep the peace.
Death of Ernest Howard.

which occurred in Los Angeles Saturday,
January 15. Howard was the son of the

inently connected In the early history of

of the Market-street Railroad Com
pany for giving; away his transfer ticket,
which Is a misdemeanor according to

yesterday, and the Judge expressed his
surprise at such a charge being brought
against a respectable citizen. The case
was continued until to-day.
