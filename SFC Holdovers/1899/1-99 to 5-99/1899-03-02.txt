HIS HOLINESS
THE POPE YET
HOLDS HIS OWN
Has Submitted to a Most
Severe Surgical
Operation.
Rallies After It, but He Is an Old
Man and His Illness Greatly
Excites Rome.
â¢: X- X
.ROME, March i. â For some
.' days past the Pope had been
â¢ â¢"suffering from the effect of a cyst
.'.'in the right thigh, which had be
. "come inflamed. Dr. Lapponi, no
ticing that the cyst had produced
'â¢'fever, asked to consult the sur
â : geon of His Holiness, and also
desired that Professor Mazzoni
'* be called. This was done yester
? day evening.
â¢ â â X The professor advised an oper
ation, which was performed this
? .morning with complete success,
.â â¢â¢"though the Pope refused chloro
â 'â 'â  form.
Â° 'â¢". His Holiness' state is relatively
? satisfactory, though the fact that
. -."he is 89 years old renders it diffi
. cult to pronounce as to his re
â¢ : '.covery.
Great excitement prevails here.
.'â ".'â¢ The following official bulletin was is
. sued to-day:
His Holiness underwent an operation at
7*lo "o'clock this morning for the removal
. . .of a long-standing cyst, which sudenly
..became inflamed. His Holiness bore the
' : operation remarkably well,, although it
'". was impossible to use chloroform. The
.-Pope's condition is now fairly satlsfac
"tory. mazzoni.
. y â  LAPPONI.
"-.:â¢ Xt appears that yesterday's, feverish
.."â¢-symptoms were entirely due to the
cyst from which the Pope has long suf
fered. He now has no trace of fever
â¢:â¢ and Dr. Mazzoni thinks no complica
-7 tions will ensue. Strict measures have
..â¢â¢"been taken to exclude outsiders from
â¢ the Vatican.
'.' â  The Pope yesterday desired that the
â¢cyst be simply lanced, but he consent
, 'ed to its removal on the doctors insist
ing upon the point.
.Doctors Mazzoni and Lapponi left the
:: Pope's apartments at 5 o'clock. They
.expressed satisfaction at the condition
â¢ of His Holiness. His temperature was
then" 99.5.
The stream of callers continues, and
.â¢â¢.sincere sympathy is shown in all cir
cles Italian as well as papal. There is
" no- sign of anything unusual at the
Vatican. Cardinal Rampolla took his
.. accustomed ride this afternoon. Dr.
..'â¢Lapponi will sleep at the Vatican.
7 â¢ .-During the operation the Pope asked
his private chaplain, Father Ang'elini,
.'â¢; to. say mass. After the surgeons had
â¢ "completed their task he was in excel
-7; lent spirits and eVen joked with them.
His Holiness slept two- hours during the
. 'day.
â "?â¢ . At 6 o'clock Drs. Mazzoni and Lap
poni* again visited him. and found that
â¢ the pain caused by the operation had
... .BO far abated as to. allow his Holiness
/to' -lie on his back. At that hour his
' r temperature was lower and general
condition favorable.
. The cyst, removed was about the size
of an orange.
â¢ . During Dr. Mazzoni's visit the Pope
' asked him how many female patients
.were accommodated at the Hospital of
. St. John, of which Dr. Mazzoni is the
' rhief surgeon, and he inquired regard
ing the work done at the hospital by
the Sisters of Mercy. He begged Dr.
Mazzoni to inform the sisters that he
blessed them, knowing that they were
praying for him and for his recovery.
- Unless complications, of, which there
is no apprehension, should set in Dr.
Mazzoni will not return to the Vatican
until to-morrow morning.
?â¢ The semi-official Vatican organs, in
â¢ {heir details of the illness of the Pope,
warn the public against the exagger
ated statements published in certain
â¢quarters. The physicians assure the
â¢public that the official bulletins regard
ing the Pope's condition will be scrupu
lously accurate.
' According to Italic His Hollnes suf
fered great pain during the operation
â¢ and remarked afterward to his doctor:
"I understand now the seriousness of
my illness. You must have had great
.: courage to operate upon an old man
..'â¢tYke myself." . *^^i'âÂ«,
â¢â¢' The hematic cyst had been forming.
: -irobably for 30 years. The only persons
â¢present at the operation were Dr. Maz
â¢* eoni Dr. Lapponi. who assisted, and
â¢* ?Dr Pio Centra, the Pope's personal at
tendant. At 9:30 His Holiness was car
ried on a litter to a window of his
â¢â¢'apartments. Smiling, he said to the
Jottora: "Do you want to play these
tricks on me at my age?" Then he lay
â¢ Sown composedly on his right side.
Although the nerve which the patient
3isplaye4 gave the doctors courage,
they feared to use chloroform and used
Instead local anesthetics.
Owing to the size of the growth the
excision occupied some time, but Dr
Mazzoni quickly traced the extent^ of j
â¢ the growth and the actual operation 1
lasted twelve minutes. Tn*e Pope dis- 1
played great fortitude. After the ban- j
â¢ Paging he was carried back to the bed ;
â â¢â¢and. nee the feeling of faintness due j
â â¢â¢ to -shock tnd loss of blood had passed â

fever quickly subsided, confirming the 1

The diplomatic dinner arranged by
Cardinal Rampolla for to-morrow will
not be given, the invitations having
been countermanded.
It was ascertained on inquiry at the
Vatican at a late hour this evening
that the Pope was resting tranquilly.
Dr. Lapponi left the Vatican for a short
time about midnight. He then seemed
very hopeful. The Pope has always
concealed the existence of the tumor.
After the operation, it appears, the
weakness due to loss of blood became
extreme and his Holiness lost con
sciousness, and muttered unintelligible
Latin phrases. ! The Pope's extreme
weakness alarmed his attendants and
the prelates and all knelt, weeping
silently. Presently the Pope asked Dr.
Mazzoni why they wept and whether it
was because he was growing worse.
Dr. Mazzoni replied: "No; they weep
because they love your Holiness."
Dr. Mazzoni then ordered the cham
ber cleared and cordials, broths and
champagne were administered with
good effect. 1 , :
After the operation Mgr. Marzolini,
the Papal Chamberlain, on being asked
what impression the illness had made
abroad, replied that 28,000 telegrams
had been received at the Vatican.
Queen ' Victoria telegraphed direct to
Cardinal Rampolla for news. The Pope
has sent a request to all who have
forwarded telegrams that they should
pray for him and for the church.

NEAR REDDING
Prospectors Take Out a
Thousand Dollars Apiece
in Three Days.
A FORTUNE IN SIGHT
Result of a. Few Hours' Work Sent
to San Francisco in the Shape
of a Yellow Brick. ,
Special Dispatch to The Gall.
REDDING, March I.â remarkable
strike of free-gold ore has just been
made on North Cow Creek. Three pros
pectors named Dale, Moore and Silence
took our over $1000 apiece in three days.
The lucky discoverers brought their
gold to town on Monday, had it reduced
to a brick in the sampling works here
and shipped the brick to the Mint in
San Francisco. The brick was valued
at $3757.
The strike is located a quarter of
a mile from the Afterthought smelter,
across North Cow Creek, twenty- two
miles northeast of Redding. The ex
tremely rich ore is contained in an
eight-inch vein and the rock is wired
together with strings and sheets of
gold.
The. discoverers came in to perfect
their location, as they were afraid
some one would learn of their good for
tune and undertake to make trouble
for them in the Recorder's office. They
estimate they have $2000 in sight in an
open cut. with the prospect that the
vein will widen as they gain in depth.
The men were washing gravel in the
creek bed, encountering plenty of coarse
gold and several handsome specimens
that had evidently come from a quartz
seam. The water got low and they
turned their attention to discovering
whence the seam gold had come. They
found a trace and followed it into the
hill, making an open cut. The seam
rapidly widened out to eight inches.
A beautiful specimen of quartz gold
worth $85 was exhibited. in this city.
, This discovery: has attracted renewed
attention to a district that has I been
neglected by ; the experienced pros
pectors. A deposit of cinnabar was
struck on Clover Creek a couple of
weeks ago, and now,â with this rich
gold strike following so . closely the
cinnabar discovery, a rush of pros
pectors to the new fields is looked for.
The district abounds in coal and copper,
though the coal so far as exploited is
not of the best quality.

DUE WARNING
GIVEN FRANCE
BY THE TEMPS
Plainly Told Not to Monkey
With Anglo-Saxon
Peoples. ,

Special cable to .The Call and the New York !

PARIS, March I. France, or rather
the French* Government, is given grave
warning by Le Temps in its leader to
night. . Its text might be said to be,
"Don't try to monkey with the Anglo-
Saxon peoples," and it's object is to
show in spite of passing disagreements
there is a stronger bond of agreement
between Germany, England and the
United States than the ultra national
ists in France will admit.
Le Temps says Lord Charles Beres
ford's idea of a quadruple alliance ap
peals to the imagination of many in the
United States, and then goes on:
"Nothing is further from our thoughts
than to pretend that when such con
ception has germinated in the public
mind it has at the same time entered
international politics. What, however,
must be noted on one hand is that in
spite of the apparent provocations the
United States is so unjustly suscepti
ble with regard to other powers, dis
plays great patience toward Germany,
and, that, on the other hand, despite
certain actions In the Bay of Manila
and in Samoa, Germany has no idea of
entering into the . struggle with the
powerful transatlantic democracy."
Le Temps then concludes that for
France to direct her policy with the
Idea of a European coalition against
two Anglo-Saxon powers would be to
-Inter heedlessly into a most dangerous
undertaking, and says France has not
yet arrived at a point when she can
write down voluntarily Alsace-Lorraine
in the profit and loss columns by con
senting to play the game of. her enemies
against liberal nations, which put into
plain language seems to mean. 'Le
! Temps counsels, rapprochement with
the United States . through England
rather than fruitless coquetting with

AND HIS NAME WON'T BE DAN BURNS
The Mexican Can Now Read the Writing on the Wall and

Balance and Fonnd Wanting.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, March I.â Events
of to-day clearly demonstrate that D. M. Burns is out of the
fight for the Senatorship.
After-weeks and weeks of boasting that the Bulla men would
obey the command of Herrin and go into caucus and ultimately
round up in the "Burns camp, the supporters of Senator Bulla, with
the single exception of Assemblyman Cosper, have rallied around
the standard of General Barnes. Again to-day Burns encountered
overwhelming defeat in the Republican conference. Yesterday his
man Shortridge cracked the whip over the heads of independent
and honorable Republicans, telling them that they were cowards
â who dared not abide by the will of the Mexican. To-day the con
ference was adjourned sine die, Burns rallied every man on whose
support he could count, and only, twenty-nine responded to vote
against the dissolution of the conference. yl '>*_?.':
The .burns managers, aided by the railroad and the machine,
are working with desperation to-night in order to hold their wav
ering forces from speedy disintegration. The Burns forces may be
held together for a few days longer in order that deals concerning
patronage may be made, but Burns himself is a defeated man and
has lost the power to name the next United States Senator, and
likewise the power to defeat the election of a Senator by this Leg
islature. From every section of California messages are coming
congratulating members of the Legislature on the work of to-day.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March I.â Signs multiply that
the deadlock is. breaking and that a
Republican United States Senator will
be elected at this session of the Leg
islature. '..-\-?--~- - â '.'â 'â . V?'7?7*
Events of this eventful day afford
theme for earnest conversation at the
Capitol. Early this, morning the im
portant news that was^kjibwn.to a few
insiders late last .night was whispered
in the Senate and Assembly chambers.
An audience larger than usual assem
bled at the Capitol at the hour for the
joint convention to meet. Lieutenant
Governor Neff presided on the part of
the -Senate, and, in the absence of
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Speaker Anderson, Assemblyman Dun
lap presided for the Assembly.
The report that the Bulla men had
joined the forces of General Barnes was
soon verified after the call of the roll
began. â¢~7:X' -7
T When Senator Bulla's name was pro
nounced? by the secretary of the Sen
ate, the Senator . responded "W. H. L.
Barnes" in a clear, distinct tone that
was heard throughout the Assembly
chamber. Â« The prolonged applause
which followed, was manifested by the
clapping of hands. The next change
to the Barnes column tr-n_ signaled
when the name of Senator Gillette was
called. Again the members and spec
tators applauded. When the name of
Senator Taylor was called his little girl,
aged 6 years, , pronounced in a
sweet, childish -voice, the name
of "W. H. L. Barnes." The ap
plause and merriment which fol
lowed this vote put the convention in
a happy frame- of mind.
i Senator Flint, who had been voting
for Thomas R. Bard since the begin
ning of the session, voted for Irving M.
Scott. . Senator Rowell, another Bard
man, also voted for Mr. Scott.
On the calling of the Assembly roll
Mr. Belshaw was the first of the Bulla
men to vote for General Barnes and the
change was the signal for sincere and
prolonged applause, which extended
from the floor to the galleries. The
subsequent changes from Bulla to
Barnes were in this order: Boynton,
Conrey, Melick, Miller of Los Angeles,
Robinson and Valentine. Assembly
man Cosper voted for Irving M. Scott.
As announced in" The Call this morn
ing Assemblyman Greenwell, who left
the Grant fold a few days ago and
voted for Thomas R. Bard at the in
stance of the. Ventura County Republi
can Committee, returned to his former
allegiance and received a round of ap
plause from the Grant men in the con
vention.
The transfer of ten votes from Sena
tor Bulla's camp to the column cf Gen
eral Barnes gives the latter twenty-two
votes. Two of the Barnes men were
absent from the convention to-day.
Speaker Anderson was confined to his
room on account . of . sickness and As
semblyman Muenter was away attend
ing the wedding of his sister.
Senator Bulla's example in voting for
General Barnes and opening the way
for his supporters to transfer their
strength to the cause of the general is
highly commended. Senator Bulla has
demonstrated to his associates and to
the public that he is animated by a
spirit of devotion to the Republican
Party and the State. . He has put aside,
for the present session at least, a noble
and cherished ambition to represent the
State of California in the United States
Senate in order to open the way for the
adjustment of party, differences. His
manly and patriotic course gains for
him a legion of friends. His intelli
gence and sense of right- enable him
to . see : that neither, Grant :. nor - Burns
can creditably represent California in
the Senate, and hence gives his own
support and by example the support of
his followers to a clean, honorable and
able . man.
To-night Senator Bulla is receiving
messages from the south commending
him for his noble course. In com
mendation representative Republicans
from every section of the State will
Join. ; The ' report given .? out by the
Burns touts that ', the Bulla supporters
have only. been loaned to Barnes is one
of the silly falsehoods of the campaign.
These \ men from the north and south
who so gallantly,: sustained the cause
of 7 Senator Bulla in sixty-six ballots
are in the Barnes column to stay and
will give the. general a support as sin
cere and enthusiastic as they gave Mr.

BULLA AND BARD
OUT OF THE FIGHT
< , . â¢
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, March I.â Senator Robert
N. Bulla retired gracefully from the Senatorial fight at noon to-day and
then re-entered it by leading his stalwarts over to General W. H. L.
Barnes. He took all of his supporters with him except Assemblyman
Cosper of Tulare County. Mr. Cosper gave his vote to Irving M. Scott,
as did also Senator Rowell? who has been voting for Thomas R. Bard.
There -was another of Bulla's supporters who did not vote for Barnes.
It was Senator Taylor of Alameda County. His bright little daughter,
nowever, took advantage of his inattention to cast his vote for him.
General Barnes said later that that vote would surely be his mascot
through the rest of the race. 7\ v
Those who went into General Barnes' camp were: Senator Bulla of
Los Angeles, Senator Gillette of Humboldt, Senator Taylor of Alameda,.
Assemblymen Belshaw of Contra Costa, Boynton of Humboldt, Conrey
of- Los Angeles, Melick of Los Angeles, Miller of Los Angeles, Robinson
of Placer, Valentine of Los Angeles.
Thomas Flint, president pro tern, of the Senate, who has been voting
for Thomas R. Bard, changed his vote to Irving M. Scott and so did
Senator Rowell. Assemblyman Greenwell .of Ventura, who went over to
Bard a week ago, returned to Grant.
There were two ballots taken and both resulted as follows:

been given to General Barnes by the
Senators and Assemblymen who hon
ored him with their votes to-day. Xyyy?
The transfer of this block of ten
votes from Bulla to Barnes was a hard
if not a final blow- to the hopes of Dan
Burns. Recently a well-known tout
made the declaration in the Golden
Eagel Hotel that six of Bulla's sup
porters were controlled .by the railroad
and would go to Burns whenever the i
Colonel snapped his fingers. The touts
were dejected and dismayed by the ap
plause which followed the frequent ac
cessions to the cause of General Barnes.
Dan Burns met with another disaster
later in the day. He had counted with j
confidence on the ability of his follow- |
ers to extract from the conference some i
sort of an agreement which would lead
by further negotiation and skillful ma
nipulation to the calling of a secret
caucus, but, to his utter surprise and
chagrin, the resolute and sagacious Re
publican majority in the conference
voted to adjourn sine die.
â¢. Burns utterly lost his nerve early in
the afternoon and regardless of the con
sequences of his action publicly sought
his Southern Pacific master to beg for
assistance which could not be given. Jn
all haste the Mexican rushed to the
Southern Pacific depot and for an hour
â¢was closeted in close consultation with
J. B. Wright, the division superinten
dent. â¢ When Burns emerged from the
â¢ conference at the depot his face showed
â¢clearly in its dejection that the inter
view had neither been pleasant nor
profitable.
Before the conference took place the
.parasites of the Mexican knew what
.was to be done at' the session. The
news had passed from mouth to mouth,
â¢that the conference would accomplish
nothing and, with the afternoon, would
. -adjourn sine die. This action the
Burns outfit realized would be disas
trous to them. They saw that they were
â  about to fall into their own trap. Their
opponents would succeed in making
Burns show his real strength. The Mex
ican's boast that he had many votes
masked until the proper time would be
exposed and with the exposure the con
ference would adjourn.
This contingency was' thoroughly un
derstood by the' Burns touts early in
the day, and they busied themselves
among Senators and Assemblymen,
striving to prevent the threatened out
come. They could do nothing, and the
information of their failure was car
ried at once to Burns. He was then at
the Capitol and went without delay to
the Golden Eagle. He remained for a
few minutes and then proceeded to the
Southern Pacific depot to the oflice of
Superintendent Wright.
After the long conference was over
Burns returned to the Golden Eagle,
where he was met by his troubled touts. |
He was disturbed and irritable and
could give no encouragement to his
followers. Wright had acted, as a mat
ter of course, as an intermediary for
Herrin. What the consultation was no
one could tell, but the face of the Mex
ican was evidence enough that no hope
had come from San Francisco.
As one of Burns' touts said bitterly:
"Burns is beginning to realize now the
truth of : the legal axiom that an attor
ney who is his own lawyer has a fool
for a client. Burns has trusted to the
lying misrepresentations of his follow
ers and he finds himself betrayed by
his own confidence. He was assured
that the conference would not adjourn
to-day sine die. His lieutenants gave
him every assurance that no perma
nent adjournment would be taken. As
a result Burns has received the severest
setback of his campaign. . His true
strength In all its inadequacy has been
exposed and he is left in a worse con
dition than he ever was since the Sena
torial fight commenced." f i/ir,
The foregoing is the opinion of one
who wishes to see Burns win. It is
colored and prejudiced as far as such
a wish can influence an observer's
Judgment. It is unfair ; in favor of
Burns as might be expected and it ex
plains why it was that the Mexican in
his excitement deliberately paraded
himself as a chattel of the Southern Pa
cific Company and in desperation
sought- the -office of Division Superin
tendent Wright.
Late to-night the touts were vigor
ously circulating the story that the ten
votes gained by General Barnes to-day
were simply loaned and were not in the
Barnes camp to stay. The Call is in
position to know that the statements
of the touts in this respect are utterly
devoid of truth. The men who went to
General Barnes' support to-day went
there after mature deliberation and
. went there, moreover, to remain until
the finish of the Senatorial struggle.
The despairing and desperate follow
ers of Dan Burns have now exhausted
. every source of strength but that which
springs from boodle and detraction. The
ptory about the loan of votes to Barnes
Is' sprung at this time to brace up the
wavering ranks of the Colonel. His
forces are on the verge of disintegra
tion. The game of wise looks and
empty promises has been played to the
extreme limit. It is evident that Burns
must gain another recruit or get, out
of the race. ... .. ..'. -V '
â¢' A pleasant incident of the Senatorial
struggle Is the following letter from
General Barnes to the little girl, the
daughter of Senator Taylor, who cast
her father's vote to-day. 7 ' .

A WARM TIME OVER
HARBOR INVESTIGATION
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March There was considera
ble damage done to the dignity of the
Senate this morning during the discussion
of the report of the Committee on At
taches and Mileage.
The report dealt with the report of the
investigating committee appointed by the
last Senate to inquire Into public institu
tions. It had been referred to the Com
mittee on Attaches and Mileage and had
been cut down less than $100. As soon as
the report came up there was trouble,
and it continued until the adjournment
for joint ballot.
Senator Dickinson, who was chairman
of the investigating committee, broke
the ice with an explanation of the items
in the expense account. Then the Pro
testants had a chance. There were two
items against which their eloquence was
particularly directed. One of these was
$4507 20 for stenographers'* fees, and an
other was $4460 for expert architects.
Both of these items were bitterly at
tacked, and finally La Rue submitted an
amendment cutting out all stenographers'
fees for the ferry depot investigation, and
also all fees for expert architects. " "..
It was mainly a question of politics that
lent bitterness tb the debate, for the
Democratic members declared they never
wanted the committee, and that it never
should have been appointed, anyway.
Bulla called attention to the resolution
under which the committee had been ap
pointed, and showed how it gave the com
mittee power to incur all necessary ex
penses. He believed the account should
be paid; it was large, he thought, 'but
there was nothing to do but pay. for he
believed It was a debt the S enat e could
not well and honorably escape.
Frick declared that the resolution gave
full power to contract all necessary ex
penses, and he thought it in very poor
taste for the Senate to nullify Its former
action and the powers It had given.
Dwyer said he believed those who per
formed services should be paid, but he
thought the committee should be repri
manded for going to such an expense.
Then it was Braunhart's turn. He pro
ceeded to attack Dickinson at once, say
ing he was the self-elected chairman of
the investigating committee, but he was
promptly set aright by Prisk, who told
him Dickinson had been elected by a vote
of the members of the committee, and
that they had made a very good choice.
Braunhart had just fairly launched
himself on his speech and was beginning
to get down to the political aspect of
the case when his ten minutes expired and
he was called to order. A motion was
made to allow him to proceed, but Boyce
objected, and as it takes unanimous con
sent in such cases, Braunhart had to
subside. /.\y â¢"â - '.'- â  '- -.a
Boyce was next on the floor, and he
proceeded to devote his minutes exclu
sively to Senator Braunhart. He had got
only so far as to say he did not wonder
at the remarks of the Senator from San
Francisco, when he considered .their
source. Scenting, danger ahead. Braun
hart warned Boyce to be guarded in his
remarks, for he would be called to ac
count for them, but Boyce went right
ahead and delivered a scorching criti
cism of the course Braunhart had pur
sued. Braunhart had severely criticized
Reid, the architect, for, as he said, hang
ing around the newspaper offices to re
port the plans of the committee and the
progress of its work. Boyce denied Reid
had dona work of that kind, and pro
ceeded .o compare Braunhart to Reid,
much to Uraunhart's disadvantage. He
also described the luckless- Senator from
San Francisco as sitting In the Senate
two years ago on sufferance, as he then
held a position in the employ of the Har
bor Commission of San Francisco, and he
also spoke of Braunhart as hanging
around the investigating committee, wait
ing to see if he was to be one of the ones
attacked j and trying to hold it off. .
Senator Doty tried to smooth matters
by calling attention to the fact that the
Senate was getting very angry and was
losing Its dignity. He was one of those
who opposed the appointment of the com
mittee two years ago and he. said he still
thought it was a great mistake, but the
work had been done and he believed It
should be paid for. "Let us pay like little
men and stop this discussion," was the
way he put it. â *:.-'-â¢.-"::
The amendment then went to a vote
and was defeated by 23 to 12, and then
the report of the Committee on Attaches
and a resolution ordering the payment of
the items was passed by a vote of 24
to 9.
Braunhart had a chance after the vote
was announced and he proceeded to take
advantage of it. He did so by referring
to "the gratuitous, insolent and premedi
tated insults of the Senator from Santa
Barbara," and saving he made no reply
and he would make no reply because he
considered the source from which they
emanated beneath his contempt. Having
given this little slap Braunhart sat down
and a hatred deep and dark was on be
tween him and Boyce when the Senate
went over for joint ballot.
But when the joint ballot had been com
pleted and the Senate was back in Its
own chamber Boyce rose and apologized.
What he, had said had been said in the
heat of debate, he declared, and. .he meant
nothing. by It. Braunhart responded with
an apology of his own and the breach was
healed. â¢?â :*:â¢â â  -:-, '-.WN 'â ' - ;-*sH&ral_

Wade of Napa offered an amendment
cutting down the percentage to 25 per
cent, and in support of his amendment
said that the State had no right to use
such coercion as proposed in the bill upon
boards.of Supervisors. He said that the
county officers knew better than any one
else what their counties needed, and. they
should be allowed to direct their own ex

Caminetti said that county boards of

passed.

ARGUMENTS ON THE
PLACERVILLE CASE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March The meeting of th/.
Assembly Judiciary Committee was the
scene of considerable discussion on the
j Placerville railroad bond bill this evening.
I Drury Melone appeared and spoke in vol
i uminous terms in fevor of the bill, while
i Judge Williams of Placerville spoke in
| opposition to it.
The bill provides for filling vacancies in
i the public offices of cities where for more
j than two years the people have failed to
â¢ elect officers to govern said -cities. It
! gives the Governor the authority to fill
j the vacancies. This would directly hit
Placerville, for there has been no public
I office filled by law in that city for over
: thirty years, as the people are endeavor
; ing to evade the payment of certain rail
i road bonds, the majority of which are
' held by Drury Melone, a Napa capitalist,
who bought them up for from 15 to 30
I cents on the dollar.
The story of the transaction whereby
the people of Placerville were put in bond
i age by an unscrupulous railroad company
| was fully printed in The Call of recent
â¢ date. The company, after getting the
'. people to bond Placerville for $250,000 for
; the construction of a railroad to said city,
! failed to keep its agreement, and if the
bill is -made a law It will place the people
; of Placerville liable to suit to pay the
bonds, where at present they are not, as
; the town is without officers.
Melone spent considerable time and en
! ergy in his endeavors to convince the
! committee that it should report favorably
I upon the bill, as did likewise Williams in
| his opposition to it. The committee laid
i the matter over until to-morrow, When
It will be acted upon in executive session.
It will probably be reported back with
i out recommendation and be the subject of
1 debate on the floor of the House.
Senate bill 80 and Assembly bill 867 were
! both reported back with favorable recom
: mendation. Bill 80 makes void a convey-
I ance found by a court or jury to have
â¢been formulated by the grantor with
fraudulent Intent. Bill 867 makes It a mis-
I demeanor for owners allowing their hogs

OPPOSITION SHOWN
TO THE EXPOSITION
BILLS IN THE SENATE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, 7 SACRA
MENTO, March I.â delegation? from'
San Francisco appeared before the Sen
ate Finance Committee to-day to sup
port the bills regarding the big expo
sition which are now pending before
the Legislature. Two sessions were de
voted to the consideration of the bill
providing for an appropriation of $500,
--000 by the State, and . even then the
matter" was not put to a final vote!
There was more opposition shown
than was expected, and 44 was thought
better to allow the question of the com
mittee's report to lie over until to-mor
row so the delegation of supporters
could have more time for argument.
On the way up the delegation elected
Charles L. Patton chairman, and he
opened the subject before the commit
tee. He' explained the plans of the pro
moters of the exposition and the de
tails of the organization so far as it
had gone. The bill, however, was not
up to the wishes of the committee, and
all the noon session was devoted to dis
cussing the powers of the commission-
ers to be appointed by the Governor
and their responsibility in the handling
of any money the State might appro
priate.
Senator Wolfe, who Introduced the
bill, explained that the commissioners
would all be under heavy bonds, but
the committee wished their powers def
initely set down in the bill, and also
that .the money be handled through the
State Board of Examiners. Leavitt
suggested that the committee report un
favorably upon the bill presented and
then Senator Wolfe could submit a new
bill with the desired amendments in
corporated, but this the delegation and
Senator Wolfe objected to, and it was
decided to alter the original bill so aa
to conform to the suggestions made.
When the committee convened again
just before the evening session of the
Senate the bill had been brought Into
shape to meet all 1 objections, and then
the merits of the exposition were nut
under the committee's scrutiny. It was
here that the scheme found its first op
position. Senator Smith did not think
,the results of the exposition would be
so great as was reported, and he asked
for the sentiment of the people on the
question. Senator Wolfe explained that
the project had not been given unani
mous support, but that it was yet in
its infancy and most of what opposi
tion it had so far met with was the
result rather of an Ignorance- of the
plans than any direct objection to the
scheme itself. ' ,77; â '. X- X
Senator Rowell wanted to know
, whether it would not be better to ap
propriate what money the State could
spare for the purpose of making a
showing at the Paris Exposition ln
1900.
. Senator Wolfe said he thought it
would be more to the benefit of this
State If money were appropriated for
a home fair than for the one in Paris,
and J. A. Filcher took up the word to
say that most of what was good in
SPAIN MUST FORM
A NEW MINISTRY
But the Cabinet Crisis Is Not
Likely to Affect the Peace a
Treaty.
MADRID, March I.â Senor Sagasta has handed the registration of
the Ministry to. the Queen Regent. -â  .?'
The Cabinet crisis is expected to last for two or three days, as It will
be necessary for the Queen Regent to consult with the presidents and
other political leaders. In the meanwhile the Chambers will adjourn un
til a new Ministry is formed. The Ministerialists hope the Queen Re
gent will support Senor Sagasta and dissolve the Chambers.
Lieutenant General Correa, Minister for War, denies that the United
States Government has protested respecting the conduct of General
Rios, the Spanish commander in the Philippines, or that the Government
has received alarming news from Manila, although he admits an impor
tant dispatch has come from Manila.
. The Queen Regent held several conferences with principal states
men and party leaders concerning the Cabinet crisis. To-morrow she
will see Marshal de Campos and Lieutenant General Ascarraga.
NEW YORK, March I. The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: "The present treaty shall be ratified by the President of
the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate
thereof, and by her Majesty, the Queen Regent of Spain; and ratifica
tions shall be exchanged at Washington within six months . from- the
date thereof, or earlier if possible."
This is the last article of the treaty of peace between- the United
States and Spain.. It was quoted to me to-day by a high official of the
administration to show that the Cortes, whether it rejects the treaty or
not, has absolutely no voice In Its ratification. ; 7;v .
He further said that as one of the preliminaries, the United
States required that the Cortes should give to the Queen Regent the
right to cede territory, and this authority was given.
It is therefore declared by high authorities that it makes little dif
ference whether the Cortes ratifies or rejects the treaty, and that the
resignation of Sagasta's Ministry can have no effect, because the Queen
Regent must by June 10 next either appoint a Minister to exchange rati
fications in Washington or the treaty will fail- and Spain will be de
prived of $20,000,000 which she would otherwise obtain. " â

Prince Ludwig Karl of Loewenstein-
Werthelm, who was reported to have
been last seen in England in ; October
and has recently been advertised for by
a London law firm, is now , acting as a
German spy in the Philippines.
The article denies the statement that
he was- last seen in England In October
and declares that he has really been in
Manila since July, 1898. The Germans
at that time, foreseeing the downfall of
Spain, were secretly trying to obtain
influence ' with the Filipinos, â  and Ger
man officers were helping ; them, while
Prince Ludwig Karl was acting ias a

he believed any money the State would

vertisement, he said, and just now this
State needed advertisement.
Mr. Patton added that in view of the
possibilities in Pacific commerce with
the new possessions to the westward
had opened out it was almost impera
tive that this State and San Francisco
should do something to bring to the
notice of the world the favorable loca
tion of San Francisco as a port of de

atic ports. 7 ."*â  â â â '.".- ""â â ' 7 V
Senator Smith believed there were
better ways than expositions to bring
a city's commercial possibilities before
the world and he said so. He. expressed
himself as not favoring the bill, but
admitted that in two years he might
be willing to allow an appropriation.
He said the country has not yet re
covered from the effects of the Mid
winter Fair, and he was not willing to
go Into another venture of the kind
until he was sure of it. Senator Rowell
spoke in a similar vein, and Senator
Dickinson suggested the same course
of reasoning in the questions he asked
the delegates. The others of the com
mitttee did not express themselves.
The members of the committee were
willing to vote on the bill this ""even
ing, but it looked so unfavorable that
Senator Wolfe suggested that the ques
tion be taken up again to-morrow
morning and it was so decided. The
committee's report will be made to

have frequently stated that If their
votes for a United States Senator ar*
not In accordance with the wishes of
their constituents, It is time their con
stituents made themselves heard. This
is particularly true of the members
from the city of Oakland, who are
steadily voting for Dan Burns.
Seeing that there is little possibility
of the deadlock being broken unless the
two candidates now leading withdraw
from the contest, many prominent Re
publicans of Oakland and Alameda
decided to send some encouragement to
General Barnes, whom they believe to
be a man upon whom the party In the
State can unite and who would be ac
ceptable to all. For the purpose of
testing this opinion Court Commissioner
Babcock and George D. Metcalf, the
law partner of Congressman Metcalf,
did a little canvassing on their own ac
count. They were surprised to find that
among . leading â  men on : both sides of
the estuary there is practically no di
vision of opinion.
Colonel Babcock headed a few sheets
of paper with the following personal
expression of opinion:
"I think W. H. L. Barnes would be
an excellent choice for United States
Senator."
' . These papers were circulated for a
couple of hours and in that time 125
names were obtained and the attempt
was given up solely because there was
no purpose to be served in carrying it
any further. Public opinion was found
to be practically unanimous in favor
of the general. No opinion was asked
regarding any of the other candidates,
but the Idea was found to be common
that nothing can be done while Grant
and Burns are in the field, and that a
man must be found whom the Repub
licans could support solidly and who
would be equally acceptable to all fac
tions.
"This was done as much by way of
experiment as for any other purpose,"
said Commissioner Babcock, "and- we
were all surprised at the result. -In
Alameda I did not find one pereon who
would not willingly see General Barnes
sent. to the United States Senate. In
Oakland I found the same thing. One
hundred and two names were put on
our slips as fast as they were circu
lated, and # we only stopped because
there was really nothing else to do â
everybody being of ' the same opinion."
In Oakland George D. Metcalf pen
ned a strong letter along the same lines
and personally went out on the street
with them. He decided to visit capital
ists, merchants and attorneys, and in
twenty minutes he had fifteen of the
best>known men in Oakland indorsing
his letter, which he sent to General
Barnes. -*
Those who signed at the rate of one
a minute to Mr. Metcalfe opinion were
the following: Judge John Yule, "W. V.
Wltcher, ex-tJresldent Merchants' Ex
change; P. E. Bowles, president First
National Bank; Fred Kahn, dry goods
merchant; J. B. Richardson, attorney
at law; James P. Taylor, president

Oakland Bank of ' Savings; Frank C.
Howe, buggy and - harness maker;
Charles W. Kellogg, cordage : manu
facturer; William Moller,., wholesale
plumber, and George E. Grant.
"These names are merely suggestive
of hundreds of others," said Mr. Met
calf. "No matter where you go the
feeling Is the same. I do not care what
branch of business or what profession
or what portion of town you go to work,
you will find. every reputable Republi
can approving of General Barnes for
United States Senator. There is practi
cally, no opposition to him." 7; . V
: Among the one hundred and more
names signed by ' Republican*-^ Ala
meda are the following: R. J. Van
Voorhees, Ben Lamborn, City Clerk;

Simpson and scores of others.
When the result of to-day's vote at
the Capitol was known there was much
rejoicing among Oakland â¢ Republicans.
The veterans, almost to a man, declared
that the winner had at last been named.
Mayor W. R. Thomas said that. the
general is the best man California can
send East. "If General Barnes should
go to the Senate," said the Mayor,' "it
would ibe I the dawn of a new . era â¢ for
this State in the East. He would teach
them a few things and would materially
raise the standard of Western legis
lators. Â

; FULL SHOWING OF HIS STRENGTH

in His Affairs Was Reached.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
?? MENTO. March I.â Forty-eight Repub
lican legislators out of seventy-seven
. to-day declared that they would have
' nothing more to do with Dan Burns and
â : his scheme for a secret caucus, and
.with the declaration, went glimmering
-â¢ the last hope Burns had of being elect
' ed United States Senator against^ the
â  wishes of. the people of the State,
i "' The vote by. which the Republican
: legislators put the seal of their disap
proval on the political pretensions of
_Â° the Candelaria candidate was fruitful
"of another result. It put a final and
. lasting end to the Senatorial conference
I by which Burns hoped to hold the law
. makers together so that he could effec
â¢ tively wield the lash put in his hands
-â ' by the Southern Pacific Company and
.the State administration to whip re
:.' (factory legislators into a dark lantern
â '. caucus. The conference was adjourned
'? sine die and Mr. Herrin's candidate is
;:â¢ how- looking around for a soft spot on
which' to fall.
;?:â¢. Yesterday Assemblyman Johnson
â¢paid that Burns had offered to with
: draw from the contest, but it devel
?:. oped ,that he spoke without authority.
To-day Assemblyman Dibble spoke for
: Burns and what he had to say may be
. considered indicative of the course
"i Burns will pursue when he comes to a
full realization of his defeatâ a fact
which has been apparent to others for
weeks past. "
'1. have just had a long talk with
Colonel Burns," said Dibble, "and what
; 1 have to say here now comes from
â¢: 'Colonel Burns himself. 1 am authorized
tq say for him that, if we cannot agree
â¢'â¢â¢â¢here and it is shown by a caucus that
he cannot win and that the people do
< not want him for United States Sena
. tor, then he will withdraw from" the
'â¢ contest."
The vote that was taken to adjourn ,
. f he conference is a certain indication
.of .Burns' strength, or rather lack of
'.' strength, in the Legislature. Every
' vote that he could muster was cast in
opposition to the proposition made -by
Senator Stratton of Alameda, to ad
.- journ .the conference sine die. All of
â¢' those opposed to Burns and his caucus

; ited a bribe of $6000 from a Senatorial
candidate; Assemblyman Merrill of San
i Francisco, who. through Dan Burns, re

Angeles.
When the conference was called to
order at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon As
semblyman Johnson wanted to Â» know
whether or not any shorthand report
ers were present. He said that the re
ports of the proceedings of the confer
ence made in the papers were suspi- '
ciously correct and he would like to find !
out how it was done. As no one vol
unteered any information the Sacra- I
mento statesman subsided and was not j
heard from again during the session.
Assemblyman Dibble wanted a cau
cus, and said so. He said he was will- |
ing to go into a caucus and abide by !
its decision regardless of who the cau- j
cus nominee might be. He then an- j
nounced that he had had a conference i
with Burns and that his utterances j
were the utterances of Burns, he was
delegated with authority to say that
if the Republican majority declared :
that Burns was not the choice of the I
people he would withdraw from the I
contest.
"Colonel Burns is willing to go into j
a caucus," he said, "and after a rea
-1 sonable number of ballots he will con
sent to withdraw and I will* withdraw
his name myself. He has not attempt
ed to influence a single vote by im
i proper means, and I challenge any one
to prove that he has. This is a gov
ernment by majorities, and I submit
j that we should go into caucus and sub- !
: mit this matter to a majority of the I
! Republican members of this Legisla
! ture." : 7v7'7
Dibble's speech had the same effect |
! on Assemblyman Clough as the touch- !
; ing of a match to gunpowder. As Dib
ble bobbed . down he nobbed up and j
shouted: "I see what use you are seek
ing to turn this conference to. You are
trying to use it to bring about a cau
cus. I will have no hand in it and I
will withdraw."
Suiting the action to the word, the
elderly legislator started to leave the
chamber, but was taken in hand by ;
friends and persuaded to remain until '
the final vote should be taken.
Poor old Senator Simpson had a word I
to say, but it had small bearing on the
situation. He declared that he had been i
vilified, lampooned and cartooned, but
was more convinced than ever that he
had done right in voting for Burns. "I
cannot help but talk," he concluded,
"because I have been abused and
maligned."
"It has been asserted here," "said
Senator Davis, "that the only way to
break this deadlock is to have a cau
cus. It appears to me that to-day's
vote in joint assembly should convince
any one that there is no need of a cau
cus. The vote to-day demonstrated
that men can transfer their allegiance
from one acceptable candidate to an
other acceptable candidate. I say this
was demonstrated to-day and I say
again that there is no need _.or a cau
cus."
At this point Senator Stratton moved
to adjourn the conference sine die.
This provoked a wrangle as to whether
the motion was debatable. Chairman
Flint ruled that it was and this gave
Senator Shortridge his opportunity to
burst into oratory. But it was not the
Shortridge of yesterday. He was as
calm and placid as a mudpuddle in a
country lane, and where . before were
threats and denunciations was now a
love tale of wondrous sweetness. He
was willing to do anything, vote for
anybody in any way if the kind eentle
men would only be good boys and go
into caucus just for a minute. It was
nice, but ineffective, and then came the
vote and the adjournment which dealt
a death blow to Dan Burns' hope of a
Senatorial toga.
Of the absentees there is but one.
Assemblyman Rickard, that is now vot
ing or will vote for Burns. ~'f-X

EQUINE ARISTOCRATS
FOR HAGGIN'S RANCH
NEW YORK, March I.â The steamship
Marquette brought from England to-day
two notable thoroughbred stallions for J.
B. Haggins Elmendorf stud farm In
Kentucky. Both horses are out of the
noted English brood mare Angelica, and
critics who inspected them at the Ameri
can Horse Exchange pronounced tnem
two of the best bred stallions ever
brought to this country.
Arkle, a breedy looking big 'brown five
year-old, of great length and range, Is by
Ar<klow, full brother of the $150,000 Or
monde. Shapfell, four years old, is by
Kendal, brother In blood to Ormonde. He
Is a compactly made bay or brown horse
of great power, with a pair of deep, slop
ing shoulders. -Both horses were bred by
the Duke of Westminister, the breeder of
Ormonde, Orme and Ben d'Or. Arkle
started and won on the other side, but
the four-year-old has not been raced.
Angelica., the dam of the two stallions,
is a full sister to St. Simon, and also dam
of [biggin's $25,000 stallion, imp. Order,
sire of Ornament and of Blue Green, Mez
zotint, Dingle and Orme. The latter
horse was one of the best colts of his year
on the English turf, and he Is the sire of
the crack Sly Fox, one of the favorites in
the betting for this year's English derby.
Haggin had not seen the two stallions
until he walked down the gangplank of
the Marquette â  to-day, Horace Theobald
having purchased them in England for the
California breeder and turfman. â¢
A cablegram receive,] in this city to-day
brought the surprising news to New York
horsemen that the English Stud Book
authorities have refused to register any
of the eighty-six American-bred yearling
fillies sent abroad last season : by J. B.
Haggin. Some of the turfmen here were
at first disposed to believe this action
would bar the youngsters from the Eng
lish turf, but Horace Theobald and other
experts say American horses may be en
tered' and raced as half-breeds,, notwith
standing disqualification in the Stud
Book. But none of these fillies nor any
of their descendants can ever be record
ed as thoroughbreds on the other side of
the water.
Theobald says this disqualification prob
ably grew out- of -differences- between
English and American definitions of the
term "thoroughbred."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 2, 1899.
HOUSE PASSES
BILL FOR ARMY
REORGANIZATION
Legislation That Disposes of the
Danger of an Extra Ses
sion of Congress.
WASHINGTON, March The last
lingering possibility of an extra session
of Congress disappeared to-day when
the House passed the Senate army re
organization bill. Very considerable
and vigorous opposition to the accept
ance of the Senate bill was voiced on
both sides of the hall and for a time it
appeared possible that the bill would
not secure the necessary two-thirds to
pass it under suspension of the rules.
But the Republican leaders, Henderson,
Grosvenor and Cannon, came to its sup
port on the Republican side, and Bailey,
the Democratic leader, threw the
weight of his influence in favor of It
on the Democratic side, arguing that it
provided for only a temporary increase
of the army which would be made
permanent if Congress were convened
in extra session.
Another big element in the vote was
Hull's recital of a statement made by
the President to him that he would not
construe section 12 as authority to con
script the minority in volunteer organi
zations which should elect to remain in
the service. The bill passedâ 2o3 to 32.
It now goes to the President.
The decks were also cleared of many
other important matters. The general
deficiency appropriation bill, carrying
$21 089 000, was passed under suspension .
of the rules without a word of criticism.
This is the last of the appropriation
bills The Senate amendments to the
river and harbor bill were non-concur
red in and it was sent to conference,
the friends of the Nicaragua canal
amendment having decided to postpone
their fight until the conferees reported.
The conference reports on the omni
bus claims bill, the naval personnel
and many other less Important meas
ures were agreed to. The Senate bill
making -Dewey a full admiral was
passed. The bill now goes to the Presi

Mahon (R?) of Pennsylvania, chairman
of 'the Committee on War Claims pre
sented the conference report upon the bill
to pay certain judgment of the Court or
Claims under the Bowman and Tucker
acts The Senate placed upon it what is
known as the omnibus claims bill, in-
Sg It to $9,030,000. The conference
report reduced the total carried by the
O uVYR rÂ«f California attacked the
conference report and the claims it car
ried lie saw no reason why the claims
of California and Oregon should have
been eliminated from the bill, but even
those claims, he declared, had no founda
tion in equity. As to the French spolia-
on claims, he said, no. one could read
the veto message of "that great man, Mr.
Cleveland," without recognizing this as a
fact
Tne mention of Mr. Cleveland's name
provoked some jeers from the Democratic

who arrived on the steamship Tees this

RESTAURATEURS PERTURBED.
BOS ANGELES, March I.âRestaur
ant men are much perturbed \ over the
recommendations the Police Commis
sioners are considering, to be submitted
to the Council as the basis for a new
liquor ordinance, and . shudder \at the
prospect of being required to pay a re
tail liquor license for the privilege of
selling liquor at: retail. Â;
Before the ordinance, takes tangible
shape there will be organized -factions
ready to ,' fight over it. The first-class
saloon men constitute one class, the
smaller dealers another, the restaurant
men flock by themselves and the church
people will be against the field. >
The conference report was adoptedâ l4B I
to 87. The conference report unpn the na- j
val personnel bill was also adopted..
Burton, chairman of the River and Har
bor Committee, then secured recognition !
and under a suspension of the rules
moved to non-concur in the Senate
amendments to the river and harbor bill
and request a conference. The motion
was carried without division. Burton (R.)
of Ohio, Reeves (R.) of Illinois and Catch
ings (D.) of Mississippi were appointed
conferees. ,
The conference report upon the census
bill* was adopted. !
The Senate bill was passed to set aside
certain lands in the Pacific forest re- j
serves in the State of Washington for tne
Washington National Park. â â 
The conference report upon the bill to
reimburse the Governors of States for
moneys expended in organizing troops for
service in the late Spanish war was
adopted. m 'â¢ '
Cannon, chairman of the Appropria
tions Committee, was then recognized and
moved to pass the general deficiency ap
propriation bill under suspension of the
rules. Under the rule twenty minutes* de
bate was allowed on each side. â¢
Allen (D.) of Mississippi, the wit of the
House, who controlled the time of the
minority, declared that while he was \
proud of the valiant deeds of our soldiers !
and sailors during the late war, lie j
thought the country had not got exactly |
what it paid for. Seriously, he reviewed
and reckoned the war appropriations at
$500,000,000, and these, he said, did not |
represent half of what was yet to come. j
Our grandchildren would be paying the
cost of this war. At the rate expendi
ture was going on he predicted that in |
two years the people would cult licking
revenue stamps and begin licking the Re- |
publican party. He had wrestled with
the white man's burden in the South unu. :
he was tired of It, and he was opposed to '
"coercive liberty and coercive religion. |
The bill was then passed without division. â 
Hull moved the passage of the Senate
army reorganization bill under suspension ;
of the rules. Hull, on behalf of the Com
mittee of Military Affairs, explained the
reasons which induced the committee to
introduce the Senate bill. It was needless
to say that the committee had been con- \
strained to report it. It was not such a \
measure as the committee would recom- ,
mend to the House if there were time j
ahead, but with this Congress in Its dying
hours the committee does not feel war
ranted In taking action that must inevi
tably cause an extra session.
Bailey questioned Hull closely as to cer
tain features of the bill. The Senate, he ,
said, had practically stricken out the age
limit for civilian appointments. Bailey
asked whether the language of the bill
meant that in case a majority of the vol- i
unteer companies who have the right to
be mustered out after the ratification of i
the treaty of peace should desire to re- i
main in the service they could hold the
minority, in other words, conscript them :
Bailey advised the Democrats to ac- j
cept the pending bill, because it met a j
temporary condition with a temporary j
provision. An extra session would fasten :
a large permanent standing army upon ;
the country.
Steele (R.) -of Indian!, earnestly opposed j
the passage of the bill, which he de
nounced as an abortion so full of defects
that it might be construed to create an
army of 23.000 men or an army of 129.000.
After some further remarks by Shafroth
of Colorado. Jett (D.) of Illinois and Will
iams (D.) of Mlssissinoi in favor of pass- I
ing the bill, the question came to a vote.
Henry (D.) of Texas demanded the ayes
and noes, amid cries of "No, no," from :
both sides. ,IS_JEaHB9^a ?;--, , :
' Only eleven* members supported the de
mand, and on division the bill was passed,
203 to 32.
Upon the motion of Boutelle (R.) of
Maine, the Senate bill was passed to cre

MURPHY HEIRS
ARE AT PEACE
Compromise Their Dif
ferences.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN. JOSE, March The long threat
ened contest over the will -of. the late
James T. Murphy will never materialize.
Wilhelmlna Mary Chapman, daughter of
the testator, and the sixteen nieces and
nephews have agreed upon a compromise.
This ; amicable condition was brought
about by B. D. Murphy, uncle of all the
beneficiaries. At the time of Murphy's
death, it Is said, the estate was worth
$250,000. One-half of this was given to
the daughter and the balance divided be
tween his nephews and nieces.
Pretty Mrs. ' Chapman, backed by her
mamma, the divorced Mrs. James T.
Murphy, declared that her cousins had
Influenced her father against her and got
what in reality belonged to her. She was
determined they would never get a penny
of her father's money, and at once con
sulted a lawyer with the intention to con
test the will. She talked freely to the
newspapers at that time, and her words
were anything but complimentary. Her
mother joined in these discussions, and
declared her ex-husband's brothers and
sisters had entered into a conspiracy to
cheat her child out of. her rights. The
nieces and nephews were equally bitter
and determined to get their Inheritances.
Now all this Is changed and the various
heirs are indulging In a love feast. Gen
ial Barney Murphy accomplished the
change. The estate was heavily in debt
and an Immediate squabble over It would
have been disastrous to all interests. A
compromise has been effected. Mrs.'
Chapman agrees ' not to contest her fa
ther will and the nieces and nephews
in turn have agreed to relinaulsh one
half of their share of the estate. The
property relinquished is to be given to
Mrs. Chapman. In all probability the
value of the estate when it Is settled will
not exceed $100,000. The principal property
is a large ranch containing 1100 acres near
Milplta*.. Mrs. J. T. Murphy, mother of
Mrs. Chapman, has a lien against this
place to secure $200 a month alimony for
the balance; of her life. She has con
sented to compromise and will receive a
cash consideration/When the ranch be
comes of a certain value It will be sold
and the different bequests paid.
Judge Hyland agreed to this sort of a
compromise to-day, and he made an order
allowing B. D. Murphy, guardian of Pat
rick W. and Helena D., minors, to enter
into it. The other heirs will at once fol
low suit. ' â â¢' '
It Is not known just what provision was
made for Miss Bertha Smalley, who lived
with Murphy during the last few years of
his life, but It is said she will get a good
slice of the estate. She, too, was threat
ening - a ; contest.- and the supposition is
that-"Lucky" Baldwin, her uncle, was
backing her financially. This would have
brought an Interesting entanglement and
it is said the compromise was effected so
as to shut out the sensational side of
"Jimmy" Murphy's life.

Los Angeles Captures an
â *} Institute.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March I.â Los An
geles has been selected as the place for
the annual meeting of the Summer In
stitute on Indian Schools, after a strug
gle on the part of other places on the
coast, especially Portland. Or. The
date has been fixed and the sessions
will continue two weeks, from July 10
to _S.
The Indian School Institute, as the
name implies, is intended for all super
intendents, teachers and other em
ployes of the Indian school service of
the United States, as well as all per
sons Interested in Indian education.
Last year it was held at Colorado
Springs, Colo., and the attendance dur
ing the two weeks was 200 daily. Los
Angeles, being more favorably located,
will undoubtedly attract a larger num
ber, especially since the National
Teachers' Association will be in ses
sion at the same time. _ -y. '
A large proportion of the Indian
schools are located In the West, prin
cipally New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado,
Nevada, Oregon and Washington, while
there are some in Montana, Minnesota
and the Dakotas. The Indian school
service is conducted under the regula
tions of the Department of the Inte
rior. Miss Estelle Reel of Washington
is the superintendent. There are a num
ber of physicians in the service and a
conference of medical men is usually
called to take place at the time of the
Institute. - y\- :v , "'. f .y
Final arrangements for the Institute
and the physicians' conference have not
been made and programmes will not be
issued for several months. Some of the
leading educators of the country, who
will attend the National Teachers Con
vention, are scheduled to participate.

MEAT PACKERS
HAVE A HEARING
Representatives Before
the Court of Inquiry.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March I.â The court
of inquiry into the beef charges held a
long session to-day, examining officers
and enlisted men .-.nd representatives cf
Western meat firms. The meat pack
ers' representatives gave practically
the same testimony they had previous
ly presented to the War Investigation
Commission, but it is understood that
this is only to get their general state
ment on the court record, and that
their examination will be followed by
a much more detailed examination into
specific incidents connected with meat
furnished to Cuba and Porto Rico dur
ing the war.
Major Jesse Lee, who has attended
the court for some days, it being gen
erally understood that he was present
in behalf of General Miles, appeared
again to-day, taking notes and formu
lating questions. He was allowed to
question the men of his own regiment,
but his questions to other witnesses
were taken under advisement by the
court, and it was understood a decision
will be reached to-morrow as to Major
Lee's standing before the court.
Dr. W. C. Bowden reported on the
beef experiment tried on the enlisted
men yesterday. Dr. Bowden said in
preparing the various sorts of meat
yesterday one plate of stew was from
canned beef bought in open market, a
second was from canned beef brou
back from Porto Rico, a third was of
fresh beef bought in the market here
and boiled thoroughly, while the fourth
was of fresh beef parboiled eight min
utes and subsequently . roasted half an
hour. The latter was the way in which
the packing houses said their canned
roast beef was prepared. Four other
plates of the same variety of meat were
served cold. As a lesuit of the test
four of the enlisted men picked out
the Porto Rico canned beef as what
they had eaten in Cuba. Two selected
the canned meat bought in open mar
ket. Two picked out the fresh beef
which had .been simply boiled. Of the
cold meat two men picked out the Por
to Rican canned beef, four the canned
meat bought in open market and two
the boiled fresh beef. None of them
picked out the fresh beef boiled and
roasted according to the packing house
recipe, t

SUDDEN DEATH OF
LORD HERSCHELL
WASHINGTON, March I.â Lord
' Herschell, one of the High Joint
Commissioners from Great
Britain, died here at 7:30 o'clock this
morning.
Lord Herschell was Lord Chancellor
of Great Britain and was sent to the
United States because of his eminent
attainments to take a leading part in
the negotiations designed to settle all
existing differences between the United
States and Canada. During the win
try weather? when the sidewalks were
slippery, he fell heavily as he was about
to get into his carriage, and broke one
of the pelvic bones.
He Beemed to be progressing favor
ably toward recovery, and was in good
health comparatively until about 7
o'clock this morning, when he was sud
denly stricken with heart failure. Dr.
W. W. Johnson was summoned. He
saw at a glance that the case was a
desperate one, and called Dr. Maddox
in consultation. The two doctors, two
nurses and Lord Herscheil's two secre
taries, W. C. Cartwright and H. E. D.
Worth Williams, were with him when
he died half an hour later.
Death occurred at the Shoreham Ho
tel, where Lord Herschell had been
staying since coming to Washington
some months ago.
Fairer Herschell, first baron of that
name, was born November 2, 1837. He
was a son of the late Rev. Ridley Her
schell of London, and Helen, daughter
of William O. Mowbray, of Edinburgh.
He married in 1876, a third daughter of
Edward Leigh Kinslerley. They have
one son and two daughters living.
Baron Herschell was a Privy Councillor,
a Knight of the (.rand Cross of the
Bath, Doctor of Civil Law, Doctor of
Laws, a Justice of the Peace, Captain
of Deals Castle, Chancellor of London
University, and was appointed British
member of the Venezuela and British
Guiana boundary arbitration tribunal
in 1897. He was knighted in 1880 and
was created a peer In 1886.
Lord Herschell was educated at Lon
don University, where he graduated as
Bachelor of Arts, with classical honors.
He became a barrister df Lincoln's Inn
in 1860; Queen's counsel in 1572; was
Recorder of Carlisle from 1873 to 1880;
Solicitor General from 1880 to 1885. and
was Lord High Chancellor in ISS6 and
from 1892 to 1895.
In politics Lord Herschell was a Lib

VOLCANIC ERUPTION
CAUSES A FLOOD
Melting Snow on a Mountain Side Endan
gers Many Lives in the Cariboo
Country.
VANCOUVER, B. C, March I.â A special correspondent of a local
daily paper this evening sent the following from Lac La Hoche, a camp
in the famous Cariboo gold diggings In this province:
"The gold belt of which this camp is the center is threatened with
destruction and many lives are in danger. The camp is in a valley
which is drained by Moffatt. Horse Fly, One Hundred and Eleven and
other famous gold creeks. On all sides are high mountains, some of
which have never been explored by white men. One of these, called
Lookout, at the extreme end of the valley, has been like a thing of life
the past week and hardy miners ceased work two days ago to watch it. -
"The mountain was covered with snow ten feet in depth in. places
and while the gold hunters watched they saw the snow melt as though
swept by a Chinook wind, while dense clouds of smoke or steam Issued
from the crevices of the mountain.
"Consternation spread through the camp, and it was augmented early ,
yesterday morning when a loud, rumbling noise from the mountain
aroused the miners. They hurriedly dressed, and not too soon, for as
they emerged from their cabins the waters of Horse Fly Creek, which
has overflowed its bank, licked their doorsteps. By noon the several
streams in the valley had overflowed, and fed by a hundred little streams
from the smoking, steaming mountain became raging torrents, carrying
everything before them. _ .
"The miners are fleeing, term*, stricken, to higher ground. The
water is rising hourly and valuable mining claims are in danger of com
plete destruction. Buildings are partially submerged and at the B. X.
C. Company's ranch, hay ricks and outbuildings are in danger of being
swept away. Employes are preparing boats to leave for higher ground,
and the greatest, consternation prevails. Â_â¢â _
"The rumbling from Lookout Mountain increases hourly in volume.
Volcanic action, which undoubtedly has already commenced, is momen
tarily expected to become visible to the terror-stricken inhabitants of
the valley. The mountain's sides are now completely bare of snow and
a hundred little streams are dashing down. Thousands of dollars' worth
of property and a number of llv-_s are said to be in danger.
BANK DIRECTORS MAY
HAVE TO BE OUSTED
Officials of the Union Savings Con
cern Seem Determined to
Hold On.
SAN JOSE, March The stockholders
of the Union Savings Bank have selected
James W. Rea. Amasa Eaton. Cyrus
Jones and L. Callisch to represent them
on the new board of directors that will be
elected to close the bank's business.
These men were chosen at a meeting of
the stockholders' committee this after
noon. It was decided that four of the
..resent directors must resign.
The directors gave the stockholders the
assurance yesterday that they would re
tire but this afternoon a rumor was
afloat .hat they would refuse to keep their
promise. All arrangements have been
completed to begin proceedings to oust
them at once should they fail to do so.
The depositors have been promised a re -
resentative on the board of directors in
the person of F. W. Potter. This leaves
only two places for the old board of di
rectors. It is supposed these five direc
tors will be elected to-morrow and then
the Superior Court >will be asked to con
firm them. _ . .______._.
The news that Attorney General Veould
take steps on Friday to oust the present
directors was received to-day, but the
stockholders have determined not to wait
that long if they fail to resign to-morrow.
The stockholders are wrangling over the
selection of a- receiver and an attorney.
There. will be fat salaries connected with
these places. 'â¢Jim Rea is trying to ob
tain the receivership for P. P. Austin
and the attorneyship for John E. Rich
ards of San Francisco. Thomas F. Morri
son is a candidate for receiver. This pro
gramme does not suit the majority of
stockholders..

South Side butcher, who has been in cus

murdered his first wife, Teresa Becker,
broke down to-night under the long con
tinued cross-questioning of the police and
made a complete confession.
"I killed her on January 27," saidi
Becker defiantly. "We were walking on
the Randolph-street viaduct and began
quarreling. I became angry and threw her
into the lake. Then I went home."
Since Becker's arrest his second wife,
17-year-old Eda Sutterlln, has been In cus

asking the police why she was not re
leased? He was always given an evasive
answer and, apparently receiving the im
pression that Eda would in some way be
connected with the dispappearance of his
first wife. Becker, according to the theory
of the police, made the confession in order
to absolve her from any. blame. The body

MAY HAVE PERISHED
DURING A STORM
Party of Ten Easterners and a Guide
Lost in the "Wilds of Alaska.
SEATTLE, March I.â The steamer City
of Seattle arrived from Alaska to-day
after a stormy trip. She had a number of
passengers, who brought late news from
the Interior. G. T. Howard left Rampart
City about December 15. He brings a story
that a party of ten Eastern "tenderfoots"
started out late in October to go from
Rampart City to the Koyukuk River.
They employed John Folger, an old-time
miner of the lower Yukon, to guide them
across the country. All had as heavy
packs of provisions as they could carry,
but only enough for a flying trip.
After they had been three days on the
trail a snow storm came up. They were
nearing the mountain range that sepa
rates the Yukon from the Koyukuk. The
fulde told them that it would be impossl
le for them to go on. The Easterners
would not turn back, and finally per
suaded him to go on, although he told
them It was as much as their lives were
worth. Three of the party turned back
and reached Rampart safely.
Two days later another blizzard came
up and the mercury dropped to 42 degrees
below zero. Late in November a party
arrived from the Koyukuk and reported
that the men under Folger had not ar
rived. Other parties have been in since
but have heard nothing of them. Mr.
Howard does not know their names.
W. P. McDonald, a -United States mail
carrier, who left Circle City on January
23, brought sixty pounds of. mail. He says
the first mail from St. Michael since navi
gation closed ' last fall reached there
within ten days. Early in January there
were two stampedes, from Circle City to
McKinley and Weber creeks, about thirty
miles away.

RAISIN GROWERS'^ COMBINE.
" FRESNO? March I.â A large mass-meet
ing of raisin growers was in session here
all day, determining the fate of the Cali
fornia Raisin Growers' Association. The
decisive action of the meeting was taken
at the morning session. It evidently was
the unanimous opinion of the , growers
that some modification must be made in
the packers' contracts, as none -of the
packers would. sign them as at present
constituted. A resolution was adopted re
leasing the directors from the obligation
Imposed by a former meeting not to
change the packers', contract, and author
izing the appointment of a committee of
four bankers to confer with the packers
and directors of the association and ar
range some terms to which both could
agree. .
-.-This- action gave general satisfaction,
and. it is thought that it -wll' solve -.-the
difficulties of the association in short or

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., March I.â Mrs.
Laura Browning of Montavilla, a sub
urb, gave her four little children lauda
num yesterday afternoon, then partook
of the poison herself and soon after
ward blew her brains out with a pistol.
One child did not drink the dose pre
pared for it, but the other three are
seriously affected by the poison and
the youngest, a two-year-old girl, may
not recover. Although there Is no evi
dence that the woman had been of un
sound mind, the theory of insanity is
the only one which will account for
such an unnatural crime.
The woman was at home with all four
of the children. She asked them all to
take a dose of laudanum, calling it
"senna tea." The little ones found it
bitter and demurred, but the mother
said, "You must take it," and all par
took except Clyde, the nine-year-old
boy. _'".'. fy
Mrs. Browning then took a dose her
self, went into an adjoining room, lay
down on a bed and placing a pistol
against her right temple fired. The
boy attempted to enter the chamber,
but found the door locked. He went
around in front of the house just as
his father and uncle were approaching.
By this time the three poisoned child
ren were beginning to lose conscious
ness. Neighbors were summoned and
assisted in applying remedies, walking
the children around to keep them
awake. The children affected are Jen
nie, aged 10; Elva, a girl of 11, and
i Ethel, the baby girl of 2. The family
'â¢ arrived several months ago from Illi
nois, having, it is said; left that State
on account of the poor health of the
parents. Mrs. Browning was 36 years
old.
The scene of the tragedy is a small
cottage near the base line road. The
family evidently was in straitened cir
cumstances, according to the immedi
ate surroundings, â¢ the children being
poorly clad and the house bare of fur
niture. â¢ \
PROBING A YOLO
COUNTY SHOOTING
WOODLAND, March I.â Attorney R. E.
H. Epsey and H. Fumikara, representing
the Japanese Consul in San Francisco, ar
rived in this city to-day. The purpose of
their visit was to make an effort to clear
the mystery which surrounds the shoot
ing of a Japanese known as Kishmoto,
which occurred a few weeks ago on a
ranch near Blacks.' ." _,-,
H. C. Howard, the lessee of the ranch,
employed a large number of Japanese to
cut wood. One night he was summoned
to the Japanese camp and found Kish
moto suffering from a pistol shot wound.
The Japanese told him a white man, who
was detected in the act of robbing the
camp, fired the shot and escaped. Kish
moto was brought to the County Hospi
tal and eventually recovered, being dis
charged about a week ago. m
Neither ' Mr. Howard nor the officers,
who made an investigation, credited the
story. From all the circumstances they
deducted the theory that the Japanese
engaged in a quarrel among themselves,
which resulted in the shooting, but they
failed to get any positive evidence sup
porting this theory, and the matter was
finally dropped. ' ' â "*.'â 
Resident Japanese of San Francisco
heard of the matter and, through the Jap
anese Consul, demanded an investigation.
To inquiries made by the Consul the offi
cers made reply in accordance with the
foregoing. The Japanese evidently were
not satisfied with the explanation and the
Consul accordingly sent an attorney and
his personal representative to make fur
ther investigation. They visited the wood
camp and also questioned Mr. Howard.
If they learned- any additional particu
lars they have not as yet disclosed them.

BASEBALL AFFAIRS.
NEW YORK, March I.â The repre
sentatives of the several baseball clubs
of the National League began the an
nual schedule meeting of . the league
this afternoon at the Fifth Avenue Ho
tel. They accomplished very little, how
ever, and after five hours' deliberation
adjourned until to-morrow morning.
Yesterday the board of arbitration
and the board of directors passed upon
the standing of the St. Louis club, and
when they adjourned it 7 looked as
though the franchise of the St. Louis
organization was in danger of being
wiped out, owing to the failure of the
management to pay to the Wilkesbarre
Eastern League club $750 awarded by
the board of arbitration for the release
of Player Sullivan and for the further
failure to pay a claim of $1000 due to
the Chicago club. v
When the magnates met to-day the
first question taken up was the St.
Louis muddle, and after a thorough dis
cussion it was decided by a vote of
seven to four that the report of the di
rectors recommending expulsion be re
ceived and placed on file. In view of
the fact that the assets of the club in
question are to be sold at public auction
in St. Louis on the 14th inst., it would
seem that the magnates had decided
not to take action which might be con
trary to law.
Whether any further move will be
made in the matter during the present
session could not be ascertained to
night, but in all probability a . twelve
club schedule will be adopted, with St,
Louis left in. â¢ .
FORMING A NEW PASTY.
CINCINNATI, March I.â A new politi

The general conference began a session
of â¢ two days at the Odd Fellows' Audi

The new organization is to be called
the Union Reform party, and it will seek
to amalgamate the Silver Republicans,
the Populists, the Social Labor party and
the Liberty partyâ in fact, ; all of the
minor parties except the Prohibitionists.
In response to the call sent out by the
chairman, R. S. Thompson, and Secretary
M. A. Neff , there were seventeen States
represented 7in the national conference.
No credentials were required,' as all who
favor the referendum principles of direct
legislation were admitted. The promoters
of the proposed amalgamation, hope to
have their party organization so perfected
as to become a factor in the Presidential
contest next year.

KIPLING VERY
MUCH IMPROVED
Passes the Crisis in the
Disease.
DOCTORS NOW FEEL EASIER
IN EVERY DIRECTION IMPROVE
MENT IS NOTED.
Telegrams Making Anxious Inquiries
Received, and One Message Is
Said to Come From Queen
Victoria.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March I.â The condi
tion of Rudyard Kipling Is very much
improved to-night. The crisis in the
disease was passed this morning. At
2:15 this afternoon the following bulle
tin was posted:
"Mr. Kipling has -gained since this
morning. The temperature and J pulse
are low and in every direction an im
provement is noted.
... V "E. G. JANEWAY,
' "THEODORE DUNHAM."
This is the ninth day of Kipling's ill
ness. In pneumonia cases the crisis is
usually reached by the seventh or ninth
day, bat it may be delayed until the
fourteenth. Therefore, there were
forty-eight hours during which the
physicians hardly left their patient's
side. During that time Kipling suffered
greatly during his conscious moments,
but he was frequently unconscious or
"suffering from attending delirium.
The most advanced scientific methods
have been adopted for the treatment
and for several days oxygen was forced
into the lungs to tide over the times
that Kipling was unable to breathe suf
ficient air to sustain life. The oxygen
.method was abandoned yesterday, a
hopeful sign. The patient began to
breathe more freely early this morn
ing and after a few hours dropped into
a refreshing sleep, the first in days and
the one essential to restore his fast
waning strength. â¢ Later the tempera
ture dropped rapidly from 104 to 99,
which is about normal. This is the or
dinary course of the disease. y/yf â  y
That the crisis had passed was quick
ly known throughout the hotel. ' Dr.
Dunham came down stairs at 5 a. m.
I and he hardly had to tell the glad
| news. In response to inquiries he said:
i "I am well pleased with Mr. Kipling's
j condition. He is now resting quietly."
j Mrs. Kipling, accompanied . by her
maid, left the hotel and remained out
for an hour's walk.
< From prominent people all over the
country telegrams are still pouring in
with words of condolence to Mrs. Kip
ling and anxious inquiries as to Mr.
Kipling's condition, and there was what
seemed to be an authentic rumor that
Queen Victoria had sent a most solici
ous request for full information regard
ing the author's Illness. Mr. Double
day, one of Mr. Kipling's . publishers,
when asked if this report were true,
replied that It was merely a family
matter and one that he would nbt.dis
. Dr. Janeway remained away from Mr.
Kipling's bedside for nearly the entire
day. He I called at 6 o'clock to-night,
however, and remained an hour. Dr.
Janeway showed how relieved he was,
but would give no positive assurance
of his patient's recovery. "I never tell
more than I know," was his cautious
reply to an inquiry.
Both Dr. Janeway and Dr. Dunham
spent considerable time away from the
patient's apartments to-night. The
former, on leaving the hotel at 7:30
o'clock, gave instructions to warn him
of any change.' He said he would not
return until morning unless some con
tingency made it necessary. At 10
o'clock Mr. Doubleday, who had . just
left the patient's bedside, said:
"Mr. Kipling is resting easily. He
has his consciousness restored and has
put his shoulder to the wheel. And it's
a good shoulder. We shall insist on
Mrs. Kipling taking a long-rest. Poor
little woman, she needs it, for her vigil
has been faithful and unceasing."
The following bulletin was posted at
11:15 p. m.: "Mr. Kipling has contin
ued to improve." XX-/X-
At a late hour Mr. Kipling was rest
ing easily and with every chance of a
restful night. * .

SYDNEY, N. S. W., March I.âAd
vices received here from Apia,
under date of February 17, say
that affairs there are still un
satisfactory. The provisional Gov
ernment, it appears, is interfering with
native and British subjects and also
with the servants of British subjects,
and is taxing the Malietoa people $2 and
Mataafa people $1 each.
Dr. Raffel, the German President of
the Municipal Council at Apia, at the
instigation of the British Consul, has
apologized for boycotting the British
third-class cruiser Porpoise and for in
sulting the Chief Justice and Malietoa's
lawyer while they were guests on board
the Porpoise.
' * A landing party from the Porpoise,
ready with machine guns, was there
fore not sent ashore, though a plan to
make an attack on Mullnuu had. been
all arranged. Several of the Mataafas
have died of wounds, including a
woman, who was shot in the breast.
There is much indignation at the act
of the provisional Government In keep
ing in exile prisoners whose only offense
is loyalty. The house of Chief Sum
manua, whose bravery in saving life

GEORGE DEWEY IS
NOW AN ADMIRAL
NEW YORK. March The Herald's Washington correspond
ent sends the following: Within the next forty-eight hours Rear
Admiral George Dewey will run up on the Olympia the blue flag con-,
taining four white stars, flag of a full admiral of the United States
By unanimous vote of the House of Representatives to-day the
bill which had already passed the Senate, authorizing the President
to appoint by selection and promotion an admiral, was agreed to.
The bill was signed by the President as soon as it reached him and
Admiral Dewey was notified by cable of his promotion. â¢ This will
give Admiral Dewey as high rank as any other naval commander In
the world. It makes him outrank not only all the officers of the
United States navy, but all the officers of the United States army,
for there is no officer in the army higher than major general, which;
is a grade corresponding with that of rear admiral in the navy. This ;
bill is also of importance politically, for it enables Admiral Dewey to
realize his highest ambition, that of being promoted by special act
of Congress to the highest grade of naval command.
Although he has not been a Presidential candidate, and has de
clined to allow his name to be used in connection with the nomina
tion, It is more than ever assured now that he will not? seek political _
honors.

'â¢ RUNAWAY ON BUSH STREET.
Wild Career of a Butcher's Cart Ends
in a Horse's Death.
A wild runaway created considerable
excitement In the vicinity of Bush and
Kearny streets yesterday morning shortly
after 8 o'clock. H. Fletcher, a driver em
ployed by a butcher in Union Square
Market, was driving down Bush street
from Stockton. His horse slipped to his
haunches on the wet pavement, and as
soon as he regained his feet started to
plunge wildly down the hill.
The boy did his best to restrain him,
but was unable to hold the frightened
animal, and the reins soon slipped from
his hands. Other horses along the line
caught the fever 'and started down the
street at a mad pace. One of these' was
a milk wagon, which swayed from side
to side, leaving a line of lacteal fluid in
Its ft. Iv *8 â 
At the corner of Bush and Kearny
streets the horse attached to the butcher
cart fell and broke Its leg. It was found
undesirable to move It, and Police Officer
Pendergast shot it. The* other horses
were stopped before any serious damage
was done.

at San Jose.
James C. Kennedy, fight promoter and
erstwhile manager of the six-day bicycle
race that ended its unsatisfactory course
last week, met his discontented army of
hirelings at the Pavilion yesterday after
noon and listened to their manifold woes.
"Czar" Kennedy was in a discontented
mood. He had been awakened from
sweet slumber earlier in the day and had
to appear in Judge Mogan's court and
answer to a charge of misdemeanor em
bezzlement, placed against him by Wil
liam J. Ryan, a disgruntled trainer. His
feelings were somewhat mollified by the
case being postponed until Saturday next,
but the thought of meeting an army of
claimants later in the day made his choler
rise.
Promptly at 1:30 the six-day riders, their
trainers, doorkeepers and other employes j
were on hand to greet their debtor, but, I
true to his habit, he did not put in an I
appearance until an hour and a half later. j
Some half dozen riders were seated in i
a side room, and as he entered there was I
a noticeable quaking among them. After j
glaring around, the burly manager gruffly
asked: "Ellinghouse here?" to which some .
one meekly replied: "No, sir."
"Well," said Kennedy, "You'll have to I
get out of here. I want this room."
Having possession, he called in the door
keepers and paid their claims, and then
demanded that the six-day riders be
brought before him. When the latter
were lined up at the foot of his throne he
informed Hale, Waller and Albert that
he would furnish them transportation so
that they could leave for the East to
night. To Barnaby, Chapman and a half
dozen lesser stars he calmly said they
would have to get back the best way they
could.
He completely ignored poor little Gib
son, the speedy young cyclist who was
brought out here to give exhibitions. Un
deterred by Kennedy's haughty manner,
the diminutive rider demanded that his
claim of $116 be paid. As this amount was
to be devoted to paying railroad fare and
hotel bills, and was in compensation for
services rendered during the meet, Gib
son was real pressing in his demand for
settlement. Kennedy refused to pay the
amount, but offered to compromise for
$50. Gibson indignantly refused his offer,
and left the building vowing to get legal
satisfaction.
As the trainers were overlooked during
the various conferences, H. D. Rucker
took It upon himself to represent their
interests, and when the "Czar" left his
room he boldly accosted him. As he got
little satisfaction, Rucker raised his voice,
and in the presence of the duped trainers
called Kennedy down for not according
himself and the other caretakers fair
treatment. He even accused Kennedy of
putting up cheap prizes for the amateurs,
and said he proved it by having two of
the prizes valued at a prominent jewelry
house. Kennedy said nothing, . but with
a kingly tread passed out, not, however,
before giving notice that he would be at
the office to-morrow at the same hour to
transact business.
It is said on every hand that if "William
A. Brady had not left tor the East
this trouble would never Rave occurred.
Immediately after his departure numer
ous acts of bad management were com
mitted by his representative, Kennedy,
and it culminated in the troubles that fol
lowed the close of the tournament. As
Is well known, the races did not prove a
paying investment. In fact. is said that
Brady and his partners In the venture
stand to lose many thousand dollars. In
meeting the bills of local people and the
claims of the riders, Kennedy has acted
meanly. In a short, space of two weeks
he has made scores of enemies, who are
taking every means to injure him. He and
his friends know this, and the latter are
defending him by saying that he is sim
ply living up to the contracts signed by
the riders before they left the East.
There has been so much dissatisfaction
among the riders at the outcome of the
meet that a consolation two days' tourna
ment will be held in San Jose on Satur
day and Sunday next. Orlando Stevens
and Floyd McFarland are going to han
dle it, and they expect to have many of
the long-distance riders and sprint men
participate. Gibson anfl McFarland will
probably meet in a match race, and tne
long-distance men will ride eight hours
for moneyed prizes. If this meet is held
it will be a direct slap at fhe management
of the indoor tournament, as the men who
compete were to ride for its benefit.
The stories of bills unpaid, claims dis
regarded and Kennedy's mismanagement
crop up on every hand.
"Bob" Terrill, the well known local cy
clist, was nearly prostrated to receive
$26 50 from Kennedy on Tuesday evening.
The amount has been due him for a year,
and why the "Czar" finally paid it "Bob"
cannot understand. He is subject to heart
failure, and is now at home resting from
the shock. Â_...
The wretched treatment accorded the
men who donated their services as offi
cials during the meet was widely dis
cussed at the different cycling clubs. The
officials were presented with entrance
tickets at the beginning of the meet, but
near its close were asked to pay their
George E. Dixon of the Bay City Wheel
men was promised $3 50 a night if he
would act as clerk of the course, a most
arduous position. As Wilbur Knapp did
not put in an appearance until late in the
meet, they also pressed upon Dixon the
duties of announcer. When the time to
settle came Dixon had $42 50 coming to
him. Kennedy-r aged over It, and said
the demand was an extortion and . he
would not pay it. He offered, however, to
compromise for $25. Dixon refused and
walked away. Later Kennedy sent for
him and gave him a "hard luck story"
about the large amount of money they
had lost on the venture and told Dixon
that if he was truly Interested in the
sport he ought to contribute something
toward it. Kennedy then offered to settle
for $35. which Dixon finally agreed to,
contributing the difference ($7 50) to "the
good of the sport."
Edwin Mohrig had a claim against the
management for repairing Fournler's
motor cycle. He presented It for pay
ment the last day of the meet, but was
refused. Ag he still had parts of the ma
chine in his possession, he- declined to
give them up. and Fournier was unable
to give his usual .exhibition last â¢ Sunday
night on the motor cycle, but came out
with his motor tricycle insteadâ a slow,
unwieldy affair, about ..which Fournier
thinks so little that he has since .sold it
to Charles Miller, the six-day champion.
Mohrig some days later .collected his bill.
The riders swear by Brady and I Powers,
but have no use for Kennedy. They say
that Kennedy is the Judas of the cycling
game; that the only way he came to be
interested in cycling-was because he was
foxy enough to, get a long lease on Madi
son-square Garden, in New York, As
Brady and Powers . are ! interested in the
game, and as Madison-square. ls the only
place in New York where races can be
held indoors, owing to its size,' they had
to take Kennedy into partnership.

ERNE AND HAWKINS
ARE IN GREAT FETTLE
THE CLEVER LIGHTWEIGHTS
READY FOR TROUBLE.
On Friday Evening They Will Fight
for the Glory and Coin at
Woodward's Pavilion.
On Friday evening the Palace Athletic
Club will introduce the clever pugilists,
"Dal" Hawkins of this city and Frank
Erne of New York, to the many admirers
of good pugilism who will be present at
Woodward's Pavilion. . .;7 'â¢
Hawkins is so well known to the sport
ing fraternity of this city that nothing
can be said about him that will be of
j news to the lovers of the game. He is
| a dangerous man in the best of com
j pany, and his many victories in the East
j and also in the West have placed him on
the top rung of the ladder in the class
he represents.
"Dal" is well aware of the fact that
I the opponent he will meet on Friday
evening is " considered by , experienced
judges of the manly art as being as clever
a lad as ever stepped under the ropes,
and knowing what a hard argument he
has to contend against Hawkins has
trained faithfully with the object of giv
ing his friends an agreeable surprise.
Although Hawkins expects to capture
the long end of the purse, he feels that
he cannot afford to let up. on his training
until the last hour. If condition will
! win the battle for the local lad then his
friends can rest easy, as Hawkins Is now
as fit as a fiddle to go a long and hard
Journey.
Erne is of unknown quality to the peo
ple of this city. All that can be gleaned
of his fighting ability is from Eastern .
1 sporting-men who have seen him In bat-
I tie. They contend that he is a marvelously
j clever fellow, a good two-handed fighter
â¢ and an excellent ring general. 'The sport
' ing class of Buffalo are very much in
fatuated with their representative light
; weight, and already several commissions
â¢ have, it is said, been received by â¢ local
j poolsellers with instructions to place the
hard stuff on their man at any odds.
Erne was born in Zurich, Switzerland,
January 8, 1875, and is 5 feet 5% inches in
I height. His record reads: Whipped George
' Siddons on May 22, 1894. in six rounds;
I fought a ten-round draw with Solly Smith
October, 1895; stopped Joe Leonard in two
rounds January 22, 1895; fought a ten
-1 round draw with George Dixon December
i 5, 1895; boxed a four-round draw with
! Young Griff o December 2, 1895; four draws
j with Jack Downey; got a decision over
' George Dixon in a twenty-round contest
â  November 27, 1896, and was beaten by
i Dixon in a twenty-five round contest on
April 7 of the same year. His last fight
of Importance was against George La
vigne on September 28, 1898, at Coney
Island, which ended in a draw.
Manager J. J. Groom announced last
night that Joe Choynski had been agreed
upon to referee the contest.
According to the "dope" book, the only
black marks that appear against Erne
were his defeats by Martin Flaherty and
George Dixon. The Palace Club is making
great preparations to receive a large
crowd on Friday evening.
The San Francisco Athletic Club, will
hold a show at 317 Sixth street on March
7. Twenty-six rounds of fighting -will be
provided. The programme reads: Eight-
J round contest, James Jeffords (S. F. A. C,
j 200 pounds) vs. Fred Jarrett (pupil of Pro
fessor Bean, 200 pounds); three grand six
round contestsâ William Toy (unattached,
145 pounds) vs. Pete Gallagher (S. F. A.
C. 145 pounds'; Jack Dean (S. F. A. C.
I 125 pounds) vs. William Perry (S. F. A. C,
j 125 pounds); Charles S. Vickers (S. F. A.

A. C, 129 pounds).
"Labor" Was His Subject.
S. Goodnough of Oakland addressed the
members and friends of the Liberty
branch of the Socialist Labor . party at
their headquarters on Turk street last

Senate Quickly Passes
the Bill.
COST OF ARMOR REDUCED
PROVISION FOR GOVERNMENT
PLANT IF NECESSARY.
Perkins Called Attention to the Need
of Legislation to Shut Out Con
tract Labor From
' Hawaii.
Special Dispatch j to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March The Sen
ate is rapidly clearing its decks for
final adjournment. The naval appro
priation bill, which. ordinarily occupies
the attention of the Senate for several
days, was passed this afternoon after
less than five hours of debate. In that
time, however, it was amended radi
cally in one respect. , The price to be
paid by the Government for . armor
plate was fixed .in the bill at $300 per
ton, a reduction of the amount fixed by
the House of $445 a ton. In addition the
Secretary of the Navy was authorized
in the event of the refusal of the armor
plate company to supply armor at
$300 a ton, to' proceed to the construc
tion of an armor plate factory to cost
$1,500,000, and placing in the Secretary's
control $2,000,000 with which: to operate
the' Government plant. / . : ??V.
The fight for these amendments was
made by Tillman of South Â»Carolina,
who delivered a characteristically sen*
sational speech in support of the Presi
dential positions. The Senate passed
resolutions of regret at the death of
Lord Herschell, and concluded the day's
session by pronouncing eulogies upon
the late Representative Dingley.
Cullom of Illinois, a member of the
Hawaiian Commission, addressed the
Senate briefly upon the bill creating a
form of government for the Territory
of Hawaii.
Perkins inquired of Cullom whether
any provision existed regarding the
alien contract laws applicable to the
States and Territories of the United
States. â¢ X: -â >
"None whateveh" replied Cullom.
"Unless we take action . before the
close of the present session," suggested
Perkins, "as many contract laborers as
desired may be imported into Hawaii."
"Doubtless that is true," replied Cul
lom. '77 .;; -
Consideration of the naval appropri
ation bill was then begun, the amend
ments of the â  committee being acted
upon as the measure was read. The
reading of the bill was concluded. at 1:50
p. m., all the committee amendments
having been agreed to in the course of
the reading.
An amendment was agreed to author
izing the Secretary of the Navy to con
tract for two' submarine boats of the
Holland type .at a cost not to exceed
$135,000 each.. '-'.;* 7;
' Hanna offered an amendment author
izing the Secretary of the Navy in his
discretion to purchase from the Cath
man Torpedo Gun Company of Chicago
the gun equipment for one or more
harbor defense monitors, subject to the
usual inspection of the Bureau of Ord
nance at a cost not exceeding $250,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Secretary of the Navy was au
thorized to appoint a commission to re
port on a location for a coaling station
on the Pacific Coast south of San Fran
cisco; to appoint a board to consider
the construction of a drydock in the

ALAMEDA. March I.â The Sunset Tel
ephone Company will not yield the $50 a
month it was getting from" the city with
out making a struggle. It refuses to be
lieve that the City Attorney's interpreta
tion of the franchise is either final or cor
rect. Until The Call drew attention to the
fact that under the terms of the franchise
the city was entitled to. telephone service
free of charge the company had been col
lecting tolls from the municipality for
eleven years at the rate of $50 a month.
City Attorney Taylor reported to the City
Trustees that The Call's contention was
correct and that the claims were illegal:
Acting upon this authority the Trustees
refused to pay the telephone company's
demand for Jaunary. Undisturbed by the
provisions of the franchise or the opin
ion of the city's legal adviser the com
pany filed bills to-day" for telephone ser
vice rendered during February. The
Clerk filed the claims, but the Finance
Committee of the City Trustees will not
allow them. The company threatens to
sue the city If the bills are not paid, and
the city is preparing to sue the company
for the money it is claimed it collected
illegally.

CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS
ARE GRANTED LOW RATES
FORCE THE SOUTHERN* PACIFIC
TO COME TO TIME.
Valley Road Used as a Club to Secure
7't.V'?-.'â¢ a One-Fare Rate to the
Convention. 7.:
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. March 1.
The Southern Pacific Company has been
forced to bow before the will of Chris
tian Endeavorers. The transportation
committee has brought the big corpora
tion to Its terms by using the Valley" road
as a club. In consequence there will
probably be not less than 6000 or 7000
delegates to the State convention, which
is to be held in this city from May 18
to 21. ...? 7 , V: ' -. !
The question of transportation has al
ways been the main feature in State con
ventions of all kinds, and the Southern
Pacific has hitherto never consented to
charge less than one and one-third fares
for a return trip. On this occasion the
chairman of the transportation commit
tee visited the Southern Pacific office and
was told that the same rates would pre
vail. A visit was then made to the val
ley road office, and the cheering informa
tion was .imparted that the Valley-road
would carry all passengers to the conven
tion both ways for one fare. When this
became known to 'he Southern Pacific
i another conference was held, and they
j also decided that they could carry dele
i gates back and forth for one fare. These
concessions insure a large attendance
from , all places as far south as Fresno.

Ihe delegates situated along the coast
line are not so fortunate, for unless a
voluntary change is made in the rate the
pressure of competition cannot be brought
to bear.
The arrangements for the big conven
tion are progressing rapidly, and some
mammoth original decorations are planned
for the old tabernacle. Oakland will have
to entertain at least 5000 people for four
days, and this will be the biggest test ever
made of this city's accommodations. The
convention will meet May IS. and will
close the following Sunday evening. The
next Monday will be given over to excur
sions and sight-seeing. The grand con
cert, with a chorus of 500 voices, will be
given in the tabernacle on the Tuesday
night prior to the opening of the con
vention, and it is thought probable that
the Alameda County convention will be
held the following day. May 17. All the
committees are reporting good progress,
and a very successful and largely attend
ed convention is now assured. -...;./>

West of Castro-Street Club.
At a meeting of the West of Castro
Street Improvement Club last night
strong resolutions were adopted in oppo
sition to the rock quarry of Gray Broth
ers, at Clipper^and Douglas streets. It
was charged that the large charges of
giant powder used in blasting rook at.the
quarry are resulting in injury to the
houses in the neighborhood. Besides this
it was said that the dirt and the dust
from the rock crusher is an unmitigated
nuisance, and one that should be abated.
The lack of lights in the Noe Valley was
severely commented upon, and a delega
tion, was appointed to wait on the Su
pervisors to urge the placing of electric
lights throughout the valley. Another
howl went up regarding the school build
ing that had been promised but * which
had never been erected. It was said that
there were quite a number of children de
prived of school facilities by reason of
lack of accommodations.

THE CEMETERY QUESTION.
-"â â  n Ta meeting of the Western Addition Improve
.â¢â  AT ment Club, of the Western Addition Improve
ment Club, held a few nights ago, a petition
; '*.' * now pending before the Board of Supervisors
'asking for the passage of an ordinance closing the
â¢ " 'cemeteries of this city after January I, 1901, was
- â unanimously indorsed. The executive committee of
..* 'jhe club was requested to appear before the Commit
. tee on Health and Police of the board and urge early
' and favorable action in the matter.
,- Xy This subject has previously been discussed in these
â :' columns, and we refer to it at the present time for the
: /purpose merely of calling attention to new conditions.
" .The petition was originally presented by residents of
" the region called Richmond. The late Board of Su
â  .pervisors did not consider it for two or three rea
'â ;. ins, the principal one of which was that it was near
* .the end of its term and did not feel like precipitating
. 'a discussion which could probably not b: terminated
? /.before its members were again private citizens. In
' .short, the subject was referred to the present Board
â¢ of Supervisors as one with which that body would
â¢' have plenty of time to deal.
* ;: - Thus the question whether or not it is good policy
.to order the cemeteries of this closed after
.'January I, 1901, is presented for grave consideration.
Large interests are involved in its proper determina
tion, but, as a matter of public policy, there is not
. the slightest doubt that some such action as that pe
titioned for should be taken. The cemeteries now ex
* isting in the vicinity of Lone Mountain are a per
â  petual bar to the westward progress of the munici
pality. They have already turned the current of resi
dence southward, and as time goes on they will be
.come a still greater menace to the region in which
ihey arc situated.
.â¢' There never will be a time in the history of San
"â¢â  Francisco when burials in these cemeteries can be for
' . bidden with less damage to the material interests of
their lot-owners than the present. The land in these
cemeteries would be nearly twice as valuable for
.'residence purposes as it is for the purposes to which
. it is now devoted, and as a financial proposition we
believe the persons interested, could they be made to
see far enough in the future, would realize that the
time has arrived when the closing of these cemeteries
should be no longer delayed.
*"'. At all events, this matter is one of prime impor
. tance, and it should be fully and freely discussed.
'Millions of dollars' worth of property can be created
and the most beautiful portion of the city given a
: , strong impetus by the adoption of a rational and en
lightened policy at the present time. If there are any
, reasons why these cemeteries should not be closed
they ought to be presented without delay. ./
INQUIRY MADE FARCICAL.
THERE is no question but the people of this
country want the whole truth concerning the
beef scandal brought out. They would regret to
see any official besmirched, and feel a sense of shame
at the revelation that contractors had been guilty of a
j crime involving the murder of soldiers, but yet they
â¢ would not have one of the rascals spared.
.; Apparently the court of inquiry has determined that
the reputations of the accused must be preserved.
Another such silly and undignified exhibition as it
made of itself Tuesday will absolutely shatter a faith
-in it which already wavers. Several plates of stew
were prepared, some of it composed of fresh beef and
â¢ some of a quality supposed to be the same as the
product sent to Cuba. Then enlisted men were or
dered to sample the stews and state which was the
variety formerly given them. vf
This proceeding was senseless, degrading and ut
terly irrelevant. There has been no claim that all the
- beef was bad. Besides, the conditions here are far
. different from those prevailing under a tropical sun.
Meat might be wholesome at Washington and rotten
â¢at Santiago. Prepared by a chef it might be less re
â¦ pellent than if cooked at a campfire. An expert em
ployed by the packers might readily select for the
purpose of a test meat entirely sound and palatable.
* Indeed, the contractors might be induced to pack a
few cans especially adapted to an occasion so august
as a feast of stew with enlisted, men * the unwilling
guests.
; â â¢; Why did not the court slosh its own palate with the
. compound? Its members draw higher pay than a
. soldier in the ranks, and to watch the soldiers strug
gling with the mess and then themselves go elsewhere
and probably gorge on pie was distinctly an impo
sition.

PORTY USAGE.
IN the second Republican conference of legislators
the precedent and authority of party usage were
trotted out as stage properties by the supporters
of Burns. The caucus has been the way heretofore
and must always be the way to settle a Senatorship.
It is precedent, usage and custom, they plead.
The answer to it is that party usage and custom
grow and precedents are established along the line of
action for one time or many times expedient for the
party's welfare and as a means of perpetuating its
power and making it a useful instrumentality for the
public good.
The caucus was originally adopted to keep parties
out of the hands and leadership of their worst ele
ments. It was adopted for the same reason which has
led to the substitution of the secret Australian ballot
for the open ticket system to beat the bosses and main
tain as much purity as possible in the administration of
party affairs. ' The caucus served this purpose at first
and for a considerable time. But the bosses have now
found a way to use it for the very purpose it was de
vised to defeat. In its very secrecy they have found
a means to the ends they wish to accomplish. Take
the Burns candidacy as an example. It rested entirely
on secret bargains made before the election. It was
influenced by forces which the Republican party ex
pressly repudiated in the campaign, and by alliances
which if known would have defeated the party. When
these bargains were made and these alliances formed
it was with the understanding and intention of put
ting them through successfully by pleading party
usage, custom and precedent for the secret caucus.
It was expected that this usage would be unhesi
tatingly assented to because it was' usage, and after it
had done its work and Burns was elected the actors
in the party tragedy would successfully plead prece
dent in avoidance of responsibility.
It soon became plain, however, that precedents es
tablished in processes needful at the time to preserve
party harmony and strength and good repute were to
be used to tarnish the fame and imperil the future of
j the party, and those who have its welfare at heart and
j who have as much right to establish a new precedent
! as had they who established the caucus, and for the
I same purpose, the party's preservation, refuse to go
into secret convention. They do this with no motive
of personal ambition, nor in the spirit of discipleship
to the fortunes of any aspirant, but solely in the in
terest of a party now so well entrenched in public con
fidence that nothing can destroy it but itself. All
party usages are established, in the first. instance, for
the preservation and welfare of the party. When any
custom, no matter how venerable as a precedent, is to
be used for party damage and destruction, in the
spirit which originated it, it should be abandoned for
any plan thai will accomplish the same purpose that
brought it into existence.
Therefore it is that there is only one precedent for
party men to follow, and that is the rule that all
plans shall be laid to preserve and not destroy the
party, to strengthen and not to weaken it, to increase
and not decrease public confidence in it. m
The party men at Sacramento who look for a sur
vival of California Republicanism and desire its
triumph next year comprehend this principle, and if
they stand manfully by will be the saviors of their
party.
PROFESSOR HERRON'S MARE'S NEST
PROFESSOR of lowa College is al
ways ready to shy his castor into the arena, and
any old arena seems to suit his purpose. Just
now he is in Chicago, shying as usual. He says that
the war with Spain was brought on by a plot among
capitalists, who entered into a compact to do all they
could to foment hostilities so that they might reap the
incidental benefit. The professor adds that he has
a- copy of the compact, and may some day reveal its
terms and the names of those party to it.
It is impossible to accept the statement of Herron,
although it is doubtless made by him in good faith.
Somebody must have worked a counterfeit compact
upon him for the sake of hearing him roar. If cap
italists were to do so monstrous a thing as he charges
they should be hanged in a row, even if the row were
to stretch from sea to sea.
Doubtless there are speculators unequipped with
conscience, but even these have sense. If they de
liberately chose to take a course so wicked and des
picable as actual treason, and perhaps even involving
treason, they would hardly put themselves on record.
Burglars about to loot a bank avoid any written
agreement, and surely the capitalists, striving for
larger stakes, must be given credit for perspicuity at
least equal to that of a burglar.
Professor Herron has cut out a clear duty for him
self. He cannot in honor avoid exposing the indi
viduals he denounces in general terms. This would
give them an opportunity for defense, and in case of
failure to clear themselves would afford the country
a chance to hate them and to drive them from a land
their presence disgraces.
Let Herron give to the public a copy of the compact
and a list of signatures. There is not a paper in the
United States but would pay far more than regular
space rates for the matter. " -".'?
PHILADELPHIA DEMOCRACY
AS a general rule a city election in Philadelphia
is a matter of but little interest to any one ex
cept the candidates whose political fortunes
are involved in it. To the sleepy city itself such a
contest is only a passing nightmare - that disturbs'
somewhat, but does not awaken. Throughout Penn
sylvania the rumor runs on these occasions that the
old town is having a hot time in her dreams, but be
yond the confines of that commonwealth hardly any
notice whatever is taken of the matter.
The city election just held, however, while quiet
enough in itself, disclosed certain conditions in Phila
delphia politics that have been found interesting to
the political experts of all sections of the Union. It
appears that Democracy has almost disappeared from
the city, and there is much wonderment as to what
has become of It.
7 When Bryan ran for President Philadelphia gave
him 63,323 votes. As it is certain no Republicans or
independents voted for the .free silver champion, the
vote for him was everywhere regarded as a demonstra
tion of the strength of Philadelphia Democracy, and
people living in the big village began to count upon
it as a factor in their local fights. They, reckoned it
would cut a wide swath in the recent election, but
when the votes were summed up it was \ found that
while the Republican candidate for Mayor had >..a
plurality of over 110,000 votes, his Democratic oppo
nent received but little more than 20,000 votes alto
gether. ' . \ '
What has become of Philadelphia Democracy? The
THE SA?N FRANCISCO CALL, THTJ USD A Y, MARCH 2, 1899:
conundrum engages the attention of experts all over
the East. All. concede that Democracy has disap
peared, but none know where it has gone. We can
not, from this distance, undertake to solve a problem
which perplexes students on the spot, but in our judg
ment some light is thrown upon it by a paragraph in
the Philadelphia Inquirer to the effect that one of its
country exchanges says: "Philadelphia is no longer
a sleepy, respectable city, but a dissolute, wicked
place, with everything wide open."
The Inquirer denounces the statement as false, but
circumstances confirm it. In what way could Democ
racy have disappeared from Philadelphia had there
not been some wicked place in the town wide open
to receive it? -â 
THE ANTI-CARTOON STATUTE.
THE effect of the anti-cartoon law, if its consti
tutionality should be sustained, has been widely,
and inaccurately discussed. Section 248 of the
Penal Code defines a libel to be "a malicious defama
tion, * expressed either by writing, printing, or by
sigqs or pictures, or the like, tending to blacken the
memory of one who is dead, or to impeach the hon
esty, integrity, virtue or reputation,, or publish the
natural or alleged defects of one who is alive, and
thereby to expose him to public hatred, contempt or
ridicule." The next section annexes to the offense
the punishment of a fine not exceeding $5000 or im
prisonment for not more than one year in a county
jail. This punishment is alternative. Both penalties
cannot be inflicted. By section 251, following the
language of section 9 of the Declaration of Rights in
the State constitution, in every prosecution under
these provisions "the jury have the right to determine
the. law and the fact." â¢
This, is the way the code stands, apart from the
adoption of the new section, which does not take
effect for some weeks. Every possible kind of libel
is included in the definition of the offense, but, as to
each, malice is an essential ingredient. The new law
extends the range of the old, as to pictures and car
toons, by making that a crime, irrespective of motive'
which was formerly innocent. The element of malice,
without which under the previous legislation no libel,
criminally punishable, could be perpetrated,' as to two
hew classes of libels is now eliminated. If a dis
tinguished living citizen of this State, not a- public
officer, does an heroic act or renders some notable ser
vice to the public his previous consent must be ob
tained or the publication of his portrait will be a
crime. The beautiful ornaments of a social function
cannot be artistically depicted without an amount of
previous correspondence that would be impracticable.
A caricature, no matter what the motive or what
falsehood it exposes, or what truth it enforces, if it
affects reputation cannot be printed without the com
mission of a misdemeanor. In the cases included
within the new statute the mere fact of publication
constitutes the offense, to which the penalty of a fine
of not less than a hundred nor more than five hun
dred dollars or imprisonment in a county jail for not
less than a month nor more than six months is at
tached. In these instances both penalties may be in
flicted. .
In point of construction merely we are unable
to see where the new law conflicts with the old.
Every libel that is malicious, and none that is not
malicious, is now a crime, for the commission of
which- the larger penalty can be imposed. But, under
the anti-cartoon bill, new offenses are created, to
which a different and lower penalty is attached.
While, however, this view seems to be strictly, accu
rate, and although the press cannot' render judicial
decisions, it appears to us that the anti-cartoon legis
lation is glaringly unconstitutional. It prohibits in
nocent publications, and therefore interferes with the
light of each citizen to "freely speak, write and pub
lish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible
for the abuse of that right." and restrains and
abridges the freedom of the press, in direct violation j
cf the express terms of section 9 of article I of the
constitution. It has been repeatedly held in Great |
Britain, and more emphatically in the , United States, |
under our constitutional provisions, that an injunction !
to prevent the publication of a libel cannot be granted, '
but, in respect to a certain class of publications, the I
new statute would operate as a legislative injunction.
It inhibits in advance praiseworthy acts, within the
very letter of the Declaration of .Rights, and, as to
them, specially discriminates against the press. It
undertakes to invent new crimes without a single ele
ment of criminality except that they controvert the i
legislative will. It incloses residents of the State in
suits of mail, of which visitors and strangers are de
prived. It extends to legislators the most . unre
stricted right to abuse their privilege and strips the
press of a large share of the privilege with which it
is expressly invested by section 47 of the Civil Code.
Under its provisions bribes for votes could be pub
licly offered in a legislative chamber, and the scene
could not be pictorially illustrated in a newspaper. It
is an attempted emasculation not only of the daily
and weekly press, but of permanent literature through
out the State.
Such an expression of impotent wrath and vindic
tiveness cannot and will not stand. Such a caricature
of sensible legislation is ill itself almost a crime. . If
this so-called enactment existed in England the Lon
don Punch would be suppressed.- It. would reach
and destroy every illustrated weekly in New York or
San Francisco. In prosecutions under its definitions,
to quote additional language of the State constitu
tion, defendants could not be acquitted, even though
"the matter charged as libelous" was. "true and pub
lished with good motives and for justifiable ends." '
This is an instance in which even the secular or
religious press can safely express an opinion upon a
constitutional question with a reasonable certainty
that it will be confirmed by the courts. â¢-*'/
The Botkin fashion of sending poison through the
mails is meeting with grave discouragement in New
York, where it was adopted as soon as this lady had
demonstrated the ease and simplicity of it. Her first
and most pretentious imitator is in jail, with the pros
pect of not getting out until taken for the purpose of
interment.
Riders who would enter a six-day race .could not
be suspected of a high order of intelligence, and yet
the management of the affair must be criticized for
trying to deprive them of the promised reward. No
man likes to be a fool for nothing.
With no desire to interfere with a noble and ele
vating sport, we express the opinion that no prize
fighter who puts oil of mustard on the Where

TRAVELING LIBRARIES ON RAILWAY LINES.
Value to California â Incidents of Travel â Books for Railway Men.
'Various Railroad Traveling Library Systems.
SEOOND PAPER.
The traveling library, true to its
name, is rarely long at rest. Its aim
is universal education; its life is in mo
tion. In fact, the most apt description
that can be quoted is to say that, vir
tually,'it is a free public library on
wheels. Its function is to ' bring the
best books into the homes of the com
mon people who live remote from libra
ries; to interest them in what has been
done in this world of ours; to tell them
of .the continual discoveries of science;
to unfold knowledge of the beautiful in
art and poetry; to teach wisdom in the
pages of philosophy ; to brighten trou
bled, perplexed lives With views of all
possible aspects of humanity, and to
lead all willing ones out of themselves
Into close mental contact with the
world. Besides this mental stimulus,
this quickening Of all the powers of the
mind, the traveling library carries in
struction which is of definite pecuniary
benefit. Who. that knows rural Cali
fornia is not aware of its great indus
tries, varied in character and of In
creasing importance? Have the ranch
ers, the stockmen, the dairymen, the
bee keepers, the poultry breeders, the
horticulturists, the lumber men and the
miners of our State gleaned all of the
practical wisdom that can be acquired
in their pursuits without the whole
some aid of books? Can a weekly or a
monthly publication, invaluable as a
good one is, supply all of the teachings
coming from the world's experience in
the past? Among various helps, the
traveling library will prove an able ally
to the farmers' institutes as tHey are
now carried on by the State Univer
sity, for the best books on agriculture
and kindred topics will, with the help
of the granges, be freely circulated. At
this very . time, when delegates from
more than a score of influential organ
izations deem their time well spent by
meeting in convention to discuss the
subject of preserving, our forests, books
and publications treating of this vital
topic could be sent throughout the
State to eminent advantage. Advanced
general intelligence creates public sent
iment; salutary legislation is certain to
follow. ??â¢
But our special theme to-day con
cerns those traveling library systems
which are connected with some of the
great transportation lines of the coun
try. Of all avocations, the operating
department of a railroad is the most
exacting in its requirements; always
demanding highest intelligence, faith
fulness and vigilance; in emergencies
calling for quickened perception and
prompt execution, with a willingness to
give life Itself for its trust.
' The writer will never forget that he
owes his life to the fidelity of the man
at the throttle and air brake, in a cer
tain washout in Wisconsin. A terrific
shock, a sinking, twisting of timbers
and grinding of glass, a lighting con
sciousness that the expected, an acci
dent, had come at last; the fall of a
portion of the train down a steep em
bankment into the swollen creek; all
these occurred in a few seconds. Not
a life was lost, not a bone broken,
thanks to the cool head and prompt ac
tion of the brave man at his post. Nor
that other incident on a heavy grade
near the Horseshoe Curve in Pennsyl
vania, when an engineer, with a glance
which nearly froze him with horror,
saw a detached part of a preceding
freight train which had broken loose
rolling down upon him. Instantly call
ing his fireman to cut the engine from
the train, he pulled the throttle wide
open. and they jumped for their lives.
The huge locomotive, released from its
heavy load, bounded upward to its fate.
There was a fearful crash, a cloud of
splinters, a mass of wood and iron, torn
and' bent in every conceivable shape,
but the scores of passengers half a mile
below were saved. The grateful cor
poration (for there are such bodies),
quick to recognize this splendid act of
decision and courage, gave the hero an
advanced position and permanent
standing on its pay roll. Others may
come and go, but he will not want while
the Pennsylvania Company lives.
Such instances, and others in differ
ent departments of railway life, are su
preme devotion to duty, coupled with
unerring Intelligence, are not rare.
They are the masterly efforts of sound
minds accustomed to instant weighing
of chances and boldness of execution.
In less striking relief, but of- equal need,
are seen the almost unnoticed labors
of the mechanic in the repair shop, the
tester of wheels and springs; the con
ductor, the brafteman, the trackman
and the operator. Everywhere, in sea
son and out of season, must the primal
conditions of vigilance and loyalty to
duty be expected. More and more are
railway managers, who must respond,
to the incessant demands of the public
for swifter trains and to the constant
increase of traffic, requiring not only
sobriety of conduct but capacity? the
ability, which is born, of instruction
through books as well as of discipline
through training, that balance of
powers which comes through the most
perfect development of a man. . i They
speak of such a one as "the best-man"
for such and such a post:, their mean
ing Is, that he i<- the finest example of
well rounded, effective manhood that
they have. . .
Some managers have discovered that
it is an excellent ' investment to pro
mote the diffusion of knowledge among
their employes by establishing travel
ing library systems on their roads. Be
lieving that "knowledge is. power." they
encourage to the utmost the reading of
good books by their men and their fam
ilies. Whatever may be the preference
of the individual reader, whether for
mechanics or fiction, for science or po
etry, for history or art, the wise execu
tive realizes that useful information,
culture, broadens a man's understand
ing, increases his ability to meet com
mon duties or contingencies, exalts his
character and moral power, and thus
the making of a better, a stronger man
insures the highest and most reliable
service to his employers. How. insig
nificant Is the cost of scores of libra
ries compared with" the loss from one
"accident." which might " have - been
averted through superior knowledge.
Of the various roads which are show-
Ing their faith In the value of constant
education to their employes through in
structive literature, - the . Boston and Al
bany road stands first n point of es
tablishment. Full thirty years ago this
road began the system of dispatching
books to . their men and families, and
finding it' successful have maintained
the work ever since. The company
supports the library, whose quarters
are in Springfield, : and the annual , cir
culation, is now between. 3000 and 4000
volumes! This would be much larger
but for the fact that nearly every town
in . Massachusetts ' maintains a local '.li
brary, ': ;so -Â trt home : borrowing proves
most convenient in many Instances. "â 'â '
/ Under totally. different conditions the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, 7 whose
lines * extend ; west ; to the Mississippi
River, began its excellent work of sup
plying employes with books in 1885.
The library .was opened with 4500 vol
umes, which has since been increased
to some 15,000; - they ' are sent out from
Baltimore and -' are distributed through
hundreds .of agencies. The - books are
returned with regularity from all points

Perhaps the most unique in plan and
complete in its appointments for the
physical and intellectual welfare of rail
way men is to be found, in New YorK
city; a building admirably adapted to
its purposes having been erected Dy
Cornelius Vanderbilt in 1887 for the
New York Central employes, and tne
work being conducted as a branch 1.
M. C. A. The* writer recalls with keen
est interest a 7 visit which afforded
views of reading-room and horary,
chessroom, a hall for lectures, plunge
and tub baths, gymnasium and even
dormitories for men arriving on Delated
trains. Of the library of 10,000 volumes
technical .works comprise about one

stations on the New York Central lines
from which, requisitions are. made for

Of more than passing importance to
California is the traveling library sys
tem of the Wells-Fargo Library Asso
ciation, composed of the employes or
the well-known express company, me
library was established in San Fran
cisco during 1890, first .for the use of
local employes.' In 1893 its advantages
were opened to the agents throughout
the coast States, and in 1894 the em
ployes of the Southern Pacific Railroad
were admitted to all Its Privileges, save
to a voice in its management. Cata
logues or supplements are annually
furnished to members and boxes which
hold two books and a magazine are
sent to any point without cost for car
rying in either direction. They are
sent as far north as Portland. 800 miles
to Ogden on the east, 800 miles, and
south to Socorro, New Mexico, about
1500 miles. Employes on every steam
railroad within these limits are eligible
to membership in the association, pro
viding Wells, Fargo & Co. have offices
on the lines, thus allowing free trans
portation. There is no initiation fee.
The membership dues are 25 cents per
month and are wholly devoted to the
purchase of books, so that every new
membership provides for a proportion
ate increase of the library, now amount
ing to nearly 4000 volumes. The current
expenses of the organization are borne
by the express company, which also
makes substantial donations for the
shelves from time to time. Membership
in this association may be continual.
"Once a member/always a member" (if
the dues are kept up) is one of their
mottoes; neither removal nor change of
business relations affects the standing
of any one after enrollment. Hence it
is not surprising that 550 members are
taking Just pride in their organization,
and that the joint circulation of books
and periodicals in IS9B was almost 40,
--000. Whether located in the desolate
surroundings of the Mojave Desert,
among the mining camps of the Sierras,
or in the busy cities" of the valleys, each
member of the association knows that,
at nominal cost, he may learn the les
sons of the past and keep in touch with
the live thought of the present through
the facilities thus liberally afforded
him. . Â«-*- '. v V
Is the question asked: "Does this
really pay?" Yes, that is the gauge of
this practical period, in fact, is the final
test of every new plan. Does it pay to
assist employes occupying responsible
positions, those who had and those who
had not early, advantages, to strengthen !
memory, develop judgment, cultivate I
imagination, quicken conscience, Incul
cate lessons of justice, honesty, honor
and morality, and lift the whole nature
into sympathetic relations with all that
Is best and most ennobling?
There seems to be but one answer to
the query, for, in the new building of
the company, spacious 'and beautiful
rooms are soon to be opened to the
growing wants of the association. The
establishment of four other libraries
within the last two years, conducted on
the same plan. as the San Francisco one,
at Mexico City, Kansas City, Chicago
and Jersey City, confirms opinion of the
entire satisfaction of the company and
its wish to widely extend such benefits.
Another organization, the Library
Association of California, a State body\
formed to promote the welfare of all
libraries, has, for a long time known of
and taken a deep interest in the out
growth of this practical work. Gratify
ing reports are also coming in to this
State society, of library extension work
at different points in California, which
will result in the founding of new
libraries and the further development
of existing ones. Inquiries will be wel
comed concerning any features of
library progress and may be addressed
to F. J. Teggert, librarian of the Me
chanics' Institute, and the newly elect
ed president of this association. -
We have seen by this last-mentioned
sketch that the traveling library sys
tem lives in California; that for six
years past it has been carrying on its
work of improvement efficiently, with
out noise or display; that it is gaining
favor with express and railway men as
its value becomes more widely known,
and that its prospects for growth were
never brighter than to-day. Here is a
system in our midst that Is no longer
an experiment; it is an object lesson
that may be studied by any one. Is
the question raised: "When, shall the
rural parts of California receive the
visits of traveling libraries?" That de
pends upon the liberal spirit of the men
and women of wealth toward this great
educational measure, for it is imprac
ticable for the State to take it up as a
general enterprise at present. Through
the benefactions of individuals and
clubs the traveling library is now doing
its work in a score of Eastern States*
that California will soon respond to
these examples is a moral "certainty

A TALE
OF
TWO SEATS.
Palace Hotel lobby last night about 7:30
o'clock. After mutual salutations "Sned,"
who is something of a joker, said: "Say,
â¢Mul,' I've got two seats -at the California
for this evening, and you are welcome to
one of them. What do you say If we go.?"
Mui'.ahy, whose fondness for the the
ater amounts almost to a passion, glee
fully replied:
"Tickled to death, old man. I saw
Nance O'Neil on her opening night, but I
don't mind seeing her again. Let us wan
der up there, and by the way let us have '
a little something first as a bracer."
After 'doing justice to the "little some
thing," the two cronies walked along
Kearny street, and Mulcahy invited his
friend to have another appetizer . for the
dramatic feast to follow, besides treating
to a couple of Henry Clays to smoke be
tween the acts.
When they reached the theater building
Mulcahy noticed that Snedaker led the
way Into the hotel entrance, but thought
that probably he intended to inquire for
his mail at the office. He was soon unde
ceived, however, for when he got. inside
Snedaker innocently pointed to two
leather-covered chairs, saving:
"Here are the two seats, 'Mul.* You
take this one and I'll sit in the other."
Mulcahy realized then that he had been
jobbed, but accepted the inevitable and
the chair, and, after muttering something
about the bunko games which were be
coming pretty frequent around the hotels
he began to view the somewhat inactive
moving panorama of Bush street; but
"Sned" never even cracked a* smile.
"I don't mind being bunkoed so much,"
said Mulcahy, in telling the story later
to some of his friends; "but I could have
seen the show with the dollar I spent for
the drinks and cigars." ??; : 7l

signed it to the furnace.
;â¢ "A more dangerous or more disgusting
pest never came to our shores," said Mr.

; ".The" maggot first made its appearance
-iri -the islands about a year ago and now
every melon, cucumber and squash patch
in Hawaii loses 75 per cent of its product
by the pest. When the fruit is three
- fourths grown the fly lays its eggs on the
top of it near the stem. When the mag
gots are hatched they burrow into the
fruit and live there until they are fully
gTown. Then they work their way out of
the fruit and burrow into the earth, where
they live until ready to come forth again
â¢.in the spring as a fly. They closely re
.semble the ordinary maggots and liter
ally swarm in the fruit.

The event of the evening was a rattling
six-round contest between "Doc" Fiynn
of the South End Rowing Club and Pete
McGee of the Princeton Athletic Club.
The men fought like Trojans from the
first to the last round. McGee was as
game as a chicken cock, and although
punished badly by Fiynn, he fought every
inch of ground like a game fellow that
he is, hopicg that a chance blow might
land him a winner.
Fiynn fought cautiously during the
bout, and in the f.fth and sixth rounds he
brought a liberal flow of claret from the
nasal appendage of his opponent, which
decorated the floor of the ring in colors
resplendent.
Flvnn was declared the winner, but the
directors of the club, who always appre
ciate a man of game qualities, did not
forget the defeated man. McGee was hon
ored with a special prize, which in point
of value will not be far behind the prize
won by his successful opponent.
The entertainment, although spoiled in
a measure by the "cold feet" fraternity.
was decidedly pleasing to the large and
appreciative assemblage of sport lovers.

with great pride, and he substan
tiates it with the testimony of re
liable witnesses. Golden Lion is
well known to every man who fre
quents the Richelieu Cafe. He is
the high jumping prize winner of the
coast, having a record of 5 feet T.i
inches. In addition to this, he i 3
one of the most sagacious of dogs.
Newman has trained him to do a
number of tricks that display rare
intelligence on the part of an ani
mal. He will send him to his house
from the cafe to bring him his coat,
hat or umbrella, or anything that he
wants, and Golden Lion never makes,
a mistake.
One day last week he sent the dog
home with a basket of potatoes. It
weighed at least thirty-five pounds.
Golden Lion took the basket and
left the cafe. He had hardly been,
gone five minutes before he returned
and, setting down the basket, began
to give forth a series of prolonged

H. P. TAYLOR
IN A SPECIAL
DREAMING PART
Hallucinations About
a Football Team.
WOULD BE A GREAT MANAGER
ATHLETES RIDICULE HIS AB
SURD PROPOSITIONS.
Without Representative Authority
He Arranges for a Schedule of Im
possible Games With the Big
Eastern Colleges.
! Howard P. Taylor, erstwhile football
' player. ex-Olympic Club athlete and the
atrical impresario, has been giving full
sway to his fervid imagination while in
the East, in consequence of which he will
have several unpleasant seances with the
college football men upon his return to
this coast. --_*"'".'â -'
As published In yesterday's Call the
athletic- committee of the University of
California denounced Taylor's action in
regard to the arrangement of a series of
games to be played between an all-Cali
fornia football eleven and the big East
ern teams during the coming fall. It ap
pears that Taylor took it upon himself
to represent the college men of this State
and without delegated authority to ar
range matched games between the picked
California and any or all the giant ag
gregations of football talent in the East
ern States.
The impracticability of his scheme is
apparent on the face of it. The follow
ing is the schedule of gameÂ« Taylor has
or imagines he will arrange: October 28,
Yale at Xew Haven: November 4, Har
vard at Cambridge* November 7. Prince
ton at Princeton; November 11. Columbia
at New York: November 18, University of
Pennsylvania at Philadelphia; November
25, West Point; November 30, the Carlisle
barks, at the same time running out
of the cafe. Newman followed the
animal, which kept turning around
to see if he was coming. â¢ After he
had gone a block or so. he overtook
another large canine, and : without
stopping to parley he immediately
Jumped on his four-legged friend and
began to administer a thrashing to
him. When Newman got to the scene
of conflict he started â¢to separate
the dogs, but â /". Detective Gibson
stopped him.
"Let â¢ him- thrash him," ho
said "for. he deserves "it.
Your dog was coming along Just
now with a basket, when that
dog ran at him and began ; to bite
him on the legs. He simply paid no
attention to the attack, but turned
around and ran . back to your cafe
with his basket. He had too much
sense to chastise his enemy until he
knew the basket. was in. safe keep
ing." -â¢ : â¢ ''X
Newman separated the dogs, and
Golden Lion's assailant was glad to
escape, while fhe big St. Bernard
leaped around his master for joy at
the thought that he had had his re
venge. The other dog is said to-be
long to / Phil Wand of - the Olympic
Club. -
Indians at New York; December 2, Uni
versity of Chicago at Chicago; December
9, Wisconsin at Chicago; December 16.
Butte; December 23, Portland Athletic
Club; and December 25, Multnomah at
Portland.
All this appears in a letter to Pete
Smith, captain of the Olympics, and from
the tone of the communication the sky
soaring date-fixer actually believes what
he writes.
The college men treat Taylor's plans as
mental vagaries. In the first place, he
wipes out ex cathedra the annual inter
collegiate game between California and
Stanford, something which provokes their
contempt for his understanding. Another
glaring hallucination is that the college
men will pack their traps, quit their
studies and embark upon his chimerical
ventures without a forethought and
merely at his bidding. The Eastern
papers seem to take Taylor seriously, and
publish now and then a prospectus of- his
coming ball campaign on the gridiron.
Taylor writes that his team will go into
practice about September 1. work six
weeks on the gridiron and then start out
on their itinerary. His schedule Is such
that no team with the constitution of an
iron horse could possibly play. With in
termissions of three days he would have
his team meet the greatest football elev
ens in the world, which is practically
physical suicide.
The men whom Taylor honors with his
choice are sixteen taken from the follow
ing: >.-*. -; â ;. ..â "_;â¢,.â¢-â¢

Taylor speaks of some probable changes
In the schedule. The men whom he hoped
to play will admit of but one possible
changeâ cessation of Taylor's waking
dreams. ______
WILLIAM J. ROBERTS IS
ACCUSED OF SWINDLING
ENGLISHMAN CHARGED WITH
PASSING BOGUS CHECKS.
Gets $10 From the Clerk of the Occi
dental â Many Victimized for
Small Amounts. -
VT. J. .Roberts registered at the Occi
dental from Oakland on Saturday, Febru
ary IS, and next day broke the Sabbath
and Incidentally the laws of this State by
passing a bogus check calling for $10 on
an accommodating clerk of the hotel.
Roberts made no representations at all
when he engaged a room, but paid the
sum of $2 for two days In advance.
He was never seen lounging around the
office, but on Sunday evening he came
in with C. C. Gardner, an insurance agent
of San Jose. There is a diversity of opin
ion between the clerk and Gardner as to
whether the latter vouched for Roberts,
but the fact is that the smooth young
man got # the $10 and a bogus check now
reposes in the Occidental safe. Of course,
Roberts has not been seen since then and
possibly never will be. It is said he prac
ticed similar methods in San Jose \ and
Santa Cruz, with several other counties
yet to hear from. The proprietor of the
St. George Hotel in Santa Cruz suc
cumbed to his winning wayS and John
Dennis and Bozo Radovich, liquor mer
chants of San Jose, parted with several
dollars each.
Roberts, who is an Englishman about
35 years old, became acquainted with
Gardner in San Jose on the pretext of
getting his life insured, giving his note as
security for the premium. In making out
his application he represented himself as
connected- with a swell English family
and that he was a graduate of Oxford.
He furnished such good proof of his finan
cial and social standing that Gardner was
completely taken in and introduced the
scamp to a number of people of means,
whom he Immediately proceeded to work.
It was his practice, however, to return
whatever sums of money he borrowed of
Gardner, probably to retain, the latter's
good opinion for obvious purposes.
Finally, when Gardner came to this >
city, Roberts followed him, and being in
troduced to more persons of social stand
ing he did them up also and then had the
nerve to invite his victims to the Univer
sity Club. for luncheon, of which he said
he was a member. They all put in an ap
pearance, but the Roberts they looked for
never came. _.-â  .
While he was in this city Roberts took
a great interest in local English affairs.
The amount of each swindling operation
never was more than $20, but the aggre
gate will reach a considerable figure.

ASSAULTED HIS MOTHER.
John Toomey Throws /a Lighted '
Lamp at His Aged Parent.
John Toomey, aged 19 years, living at â 
333 Harriet street, threw a . lighted coal
oil lamp at his mother last evening be- |
cause he did not like the supper she had
prepared for him. The lamp struck her on I
the left side of the face, but fortunately |
did not explode Then, picking up a knife, !
the 'infuriated man rushed at his aged
parent, but before he had a chance to use \
the | weapon his mother ran from the j
house, lustily calling for the police.
Officers Riordan, Dougherty and J. T. I
Murphy responded and proceeded to place j
the Inhuman : son under . arrest. - Toomey I
made a vigorous resistance, but was sub
dued after a short â¢'. struggle. He " was
then taken to the City Prison, where he
was charged with an assault -with a
deadly weapon. â 'â â¢",
Shortly - ' afterward Mrs. Toomey ap
peared and demanded that her son be i
releasejJ. Her face was bruised,' the result j
Of coming in contact with the lamp
hurled by her son, and when asked 1 " by-
Turnkey Hickey \ how she had <" received
the injury, she pretended not to know.
She threatened to bring the arresting offi

claiming that they had "brutally assault
ed her son."
According to the police : Toomey was '
recently released from the County Jail,
where he had served six months f or* bat

BLOWN UP ALL
CHINATOWN
The Bomb Was Filled
With Dynamite.
BOY SMOTHERED THE FUSE
SAM TUPS HELD A SIGNIFICANT
"CONFERENCE.
The Order Has Gone Forth Prohibit
ing All Members of the Tongs
From Testifying Against
Way Yum Hung.
Although on the outside Chinatown
looks calm and peaceful, it Is In anything
but a quiet state. Meetings of the com
panies and tongs are being held at all
hours, and occasionally the police are
finding a quiet little gathering of high
binders. The trouble of late has all been
in the various tongs of the Sam Yups,
and the company is doing all in its power
to patch up a peace.
Investigation was made yesterday in
relation to the bomb found Monday night
in Sullivan alley. It contained enough
explosives to shatter half the houses in
Chinatown and shake the whole city, as
well as giving Oakland and Alameda a
little tremor. There were eleven dyna
mite cartridges, heavily charged, and
three ounces of nitro-glycerine in the In
fernal machine. The credit of preventing
an explosion is not due to one of the
women fa the house throwing water on it,
as first reported, but to a boy who ped
dles soup In the locality. He saw the
sputtering fuse and at once put his foot
on it and smothered the light. Later the
woman threw water on it. A peculiar co
incidence Is found in the fact that a ma
chine was set at the same house fourteen
years ago.
A long meeting of the Sam Yups was
held yesterday; at which the shooting of
Pon Hung and the trouble in the Chin
family were the chief topics of conversa
tion. The trouble in the Chin family has
been patched up.
The result of the conference regarding
the Pon Hung murder is rather discour
aging to the police. Way Yum Hung was
caught running away from the murder by
Lieutenant Price and charged with hav
ing committed the deed. At the meeting
of the Sam Yups, however, a ukase was
issued forbidding any members of | the
tongs connected with this company giv
ing any evidence whatever regarding the
murder. The police have nothing now but
the bare circumstantial evidence, as the
Chinese will sooner break their oaths
than violate an order of the company.
The whole situation is every day be
coming more complicated and the set
tlement will probably be the same Old
one blood.
Says the Woman Is an Imposter.
The officers of the Little Sisters' Infant
Shelter, 512 Minna street, have been much
annoyed lately by a woman, giving the
name of Mrs. Thompson, who represents
herself as authorized to collect money for
the institution. Mrs. Cooper, president of
the charity, has announced that the
woman is in no way connected with the
shelter, and that neither she nor any
one else is authorized to solicit for that
institution. , .
California Eggs Shipped East,
Six carloads of eggs were shipped yes
terday to replenish. the Eastern market,
which has suffered much in consequence
of the recent storms. . In Chicago egg*
have been retailing for 50 cents a dozen.
The demand in the. East caused the price
to rise in this city, but the prospect of
a plentiful supply has pulled the prices
down again.

It is the great medical triumph of the

years of scientific research by the emi-
nent kidney and bladder, specialist, Dr.
Kilmer, and has truly wonderful pow-
ers in curing kidney, liver, bladder and
uric acid diseases. ' '.. X/iy
Kidney trouble is responsible for more
sickness and sudden deaths than any

thousands have It without knowing it.
Thousands owe their health and even
life to Swamp-Root and thousands
more who to-day think themselves be-
yond help, can be made well by the use
of this great remedy.
. Swamp-Root has been " tested in so
many ways, in hospital work, in private
practice, among the helpless, too poor
to purchase relief, and has proved so
successful in every case that a special
arrangement has been made by which
all readers of The Call, who have not
already tried it, may have a sample

Also a book telling more about Swamp-
Root and containing some of the thou-

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March I.â Stocks to-day opened
up anc' then worked lower with some rallies.
Dealings, were on rather a less extensive scale
than of late. The specialties displayed ex
treme Irregularity and the standard stocks
showed weakness most of the day. The open- j
Ing rise was associated > with the more favor- j
able aspect- of the Philippine situation due to. j
Germany's withdrawal of her cruiser, sup- j
posedly lessening the chance of complications. :
The $28,000, ' In dividends and interest which
was payable to-day had but little effect upon
the money market. Atchison preferred and
Burlington had an early appearance of j
strength, but a large volume of selling orders j
appeared which, rightly or wrongly, was at
tributed to some of the leading bull interests
that had been conspicuous purchasers for two
months. The same interests appeared to be !
sellers of the standard stocks. As the market
ran off stop-loss orders were reacned in some
cases, while London was a source of support,
taking about 20,000 shares on balance. The ef
fect of this purchasing was reflected in a
weaker tone for sterling exchange. Prices after
the extreme decline rose on moderate dealings
and then wavered downward and upward In a
sluggish manner, there appearing little pres
sure of offerings or urgent demands. The
specialties which were conspicuous In the Ini
tial advance were about equally prominent on
the declines. Among the high-priced stocks
Third-avenue Railroad, Consolidated Gas and j
Tobacco made notable gains, part of which was
lost In the late trading. The professionals were
ln control of trading most of the day and most
of the large Interests were not very active, |
giving the bears confidence In their aggressive I
tactics. Southern and Central Pacific were
under pressure much of the day! The market
weakened toward the close, the activity being
at the expense of values with considerable
belling of the grangers, and the market left off
with fractional net losses in most stocks, with
the tone weak.
Trading in bonds was considerably mixed,
weakness and strength developing in Important
issues. Total sales, $4,670,000. United States
bonds were unchanged In the bid quotations.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW TORK. March Lâ The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were very inactive to-day.
They were depressed by the Spanish political
outlook and by the Paris settlement. Ameri
cans opened a shade above parities, but there
was no business In them until near 3 o'clock,
when New York sent advance orders, causing
a 'rally. There were sharp setbacks later.
Atchison preferred and St. Paul were the weak
est features. The close was slightly above
the worst. London was sympathetic. Copper
was dull; Utahs, 5.104; Bostons, 6.508; money
was ln fair demand.

CHICAGO WHEAT MARKET.
CHICAGO, March Wheat started about
where It left off yesterday, but the tendency
was rather downward for an hour or so. The
early news brought matter of comfort to both
bulls and bears. The former were encouraged
by the firmness of foreign markets, bad crop
reports and diminishing domestic receipts. The
latter were consoled by rains In California,
where drought has existed, and weather
throughout the .winter wheat country less se
verely cold than had been expected. Thoman's
estimate of wheat in farmers' hands March 1
made the quantity 218,000,000 bushels, and the
market became weak on that /announcement.
New York reported very little inquiry for
export. May opened a shade higher at
73% c and declined to 73%Â©73% c. It reached
its low point on the Thoman figures. The
shorts did the selling, and when they held
their hand a few- minutes the price bobbed
again to 73% c and closed with sellers at 73% c,
a loss of %o%c. /.Â»â .'-..-,:.
Light receipts and heavy clearances held corn
steady within a narrow range. May left off
unchanged.
Oats were dull and followed -corn. The close I
Is unchanged.
Provisions took an unexpected turn. The
market opened heavy, but shorts for some un- '
foreseen reason took alarm and advanced the
prices quickly. Pork closed with a gain of

pace that previously characterized it. A few
large manufacturer** have been seen, but noth-.

sulted from their tmjuiriea.
Prices are steady. I-ow wools have the vogue
now and many persons are of the opinion that
they will continue to be in relatively strong
demand for a very considerable period.
â  We have it on the authority of well-known
retailers that cheviot* an.l ladies" dross goods
are likely next year to be ma.de very largely
of low wools. l^arge sales of carpet wools
were a feature of the week's business. . The

! HELPER ENGINE AND TRAIN
COLLIDE.
I
Crash Together While Running at a
High Si eed at the Foot of White
Plains Grade in
Nevada.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OGDEN, March 1. â An engineer and
two firemen were killed In a collision
on the Central Paciflc near Hot
Springs, Nev., at 11 o'clock last night.
A Raymond special running as the first
section ;of eastbound passenger No. 1
collided with a helper engine on what
is known as White Plains Hill. The
helper had Just pushed a freight over
the heavy grade and was running on
orders against section two of the pas
senger and on combination orders with
the first section. Misunderstanding the
orders, the engineer immediately back
ed his engine down the hill, running
Into the passenger a mile east of Hot

FIREMEN HENDERSHOT, of the
helper.
ENGINEER YEARGIN, of the pas

FIREMAN DILLARD, of the passen

Engineer- Schrieber of the helper is
badly 'injured. A heavy rain at the
time contributed to bring about the ac
cident.
It seems that Engineer Adam
Schrieber of the helper engine misread
! his orders giving him the right of the
I track over the second section of No. 1.
Schrieber evidently thought he had the
right of track for an hour, forgetting
the first section of No. 1. The first sec

ning at a high rate of speed, as was
the Schrieber helper engine, and they
came together at the foot of White
PAPA'S THANKS CAME
WITH THE BUTTER
Actor Hastings Disillusionizes a Little
Country Maid and Earns a
Parent's Gratitude.
ERNEST' HASTINGS, leading man of the Alcazar Theater, has a box
of fresh ranch butter that he does not exactly know what to do with. He
can't give it away, nor raffle It, for It is a present, a token of esteem, and
the ethics of good society discourages such treatment of gifts. The per-,
ishable nature of the offering makes it Impossible for the actor to cherish It
with the other relics of numerous admirers, and in consequence the Thespian
is a very much perplexed though grateful man.
Hastings won his butter by the excellence of his actingâ in privatellfe â and
the eloquence with which he put forth sentiments that were not the play
wright's,-but his own. i^V^.N~-;' 'VVt'-v'' - Vv* : : -
About three weeks ago a sweet little maid from the Napa hills felt the fire
of genius burn iri her veins, and rinsing the dishwater from her little red
hands came to town to study, to hope and to prepare for a life of histrionic
triumphs. Th-Â» little country girl's first visit in town' was to the O'Farrell
street playhouse. The first sight of the manly leading man filled her unsoph
isticated heart to bursting, and after that eventful visit, night after night the
maid from Napa sat in the theater watching with eager eyes the hero of her
fancy The little girl's mad infatuation soon became known to her friends,
who decided to at once notify her father. . â¢ ' , _ .
Papa came to town on Friday last, but instead of arguing with his lass
he went to the actor and laid the case before him. Saturday morning Hast
ings' mail contained the regular missive from the infatuated maid; Saturday
after the matinee a little girl was made happy by receiving a note asking her
to meet the actor on Monday morning in the office of the Alcazar Theater.
It was an eager, excited little girl who went into that office on Monday
morning but it was a very wise and tearful young woman -who came out a
half hour later, after promising a real live actor that she would go home in
afternoon with papa. _._._. of butter: and that is why he says
And that is how Hastings got his box of butter: and that is why he says
he will always keep the accompanying note, which said: "We are home. She
is sad but sensible, and last night, of her own free will, rolled up her
sleeves and helped mother with the dishes. This butter is in gratitude.'' -
The brotherly advice Actor Hastings gave the maiden at the behest of her
father is said to have been onÂ© of the best bits of work he ever did. ;) V-" !; .

OVER A PRECIPICE
INTO A SNOWBANK
Mining Man's Remarkable Escape
Prom Death in the Cariboo
Country.
VANCOUVER, B. C, March I.â The
special correspondent of the Daily Prov
ince sends from Lac La Hoche, in the
Cariboo gold district, the following story
of a well-known mining man's marvelous
escape from a terrible death:
Steve Tingley, who with Captain Irving
of Victoria is now purchasing several
hundred horses for the Atlln district, lost
control of his bronchos while driving on
the summit of a mountain near here the
other day. The animals dashed madly
along- the narrow trail and Tingley was
finally hurled down a precipice, falling a
distance of fifty feet.
At the foot of the precipice are large
jagged rocks, but fortunately they are
now covered by nearly ten feet of snow.
Tingley was thrown into the snow and
for a time lay unconscious, covered by
the fleecy* mantle. Recovering conscious
ness he dug his way out and painfully
dragged himself through the drifts to a.
rancher's house a half mile distant. Ter
ribly shattered In body, but. strange to
say, with no bones broken, his vitality in
the struggle for life through the snow
was marvelous. He was looked after un
til friends who were out searching for his
remains were notified, when he was taken
to his home. The doctors say he will re
cover.

of the town's finances will not permit the
continuance of this expense. The lighting
company offered to supply the regular
twenty lights at the old rate, or a lesser
number at the rate of $10 each a month.
The Trustees tendered the company $96 a
month for twelve lights, to be placed as
designated by the board. This tender was
rejected. It Is probable the lights will not
remain off very long. The people have
commenced "kicking" vigorously over the
action of the board.

MACADIE CLAIMS THE HONOR
REPORTS FROM ALL PARTS OP
THE STATE.
Professor Hammon of the Weather
Bureau Says the Storm Is Likely
to Continue for Several
Days.
Professor MacAdie is the man who did
it. Late Tuesday evening W. H. Ham
mon resigned and received a telegram
from Washington that MacAdie had been
appointed to succeed him as weather fore
caster of this station. Both the old and
the new are now at friendly warâ shout
ing their respective claims to the paterni
ty of the present storm that Is hovering
off our coast.
MacAdie says; "I am the man. Just
I as soon as the wires ticked my appoint
| ment the rain began to trickle on this
i parched earth. We will have nothing else
f as long as I rule the elements. There is
! no need to vociferate about the wet now.
j I shall give you a cornucopic plenty."
Professor Hammon, who is going to
Pittsburg to manage a mastodonic electric j
light plant, denies the proprietary right I
of MacAdie to this dribbling storm. He
! said late yesterday afternoon:
"These are my last few days and I am ;
! happy that my departure is attendant
with such favoring elements. Clouds and |
I rain are sunshine to us now and this is my
; last gift to California. It is not much, of j
| course, but I have a promise for more to â 
! come. I see no Indications of a permanent j
clearing. The storm might break to-night, i
j but I think I can promise you more rain \
within thirty-six hours. We will not have |
a southeaster. As a rule during the month
! of February the southwest wind brings !
rain and that is what we will depend upon J
for our rainfall during this storm."
The forecasters on the top of the Mills
building displayed a professional inter
est in yesterday's storm, but the majority >
of people in this city came nearer to j
earth and separated themselves from sci- |
I ence. To them it was a reduction in the
price of meat and cereals, and that Is why |
they kept a fixed eye on the weather :
vanes to see which way the wind blew. â 
Those who believed in the efficacy of !
prayer continued praying, and the hope-
I ful began to hope again. The storm is ;
! likely to last a few days, although Pro- ;
i fessor Hammon will give no assurance of .
it.
The northern counties benefited by the ;
j downpour, which did not reach fai
enough south to affect that region.
LIGHT SHOWERS PALL-
Drought Broken in Many Sections of
the State.
SAN JOSE, March Two days of
cloudy weather terminated with light
showers this afternoon. About .02 of an
Inch fell. There Is no wind or other indi
cations of a heavy rain, but it is hoped
that the moist weather may continue so
as to avoid the necessity., of winter irri
gation. Crops have not suffered seriously
as yet, as orchardlsts generally have been
irrigating since early in February. Jan
uary rains only wet the ground from fif
teen to twenty inches, not enough for
trees. Grain had plenty of moisture and
has done well, but a trip over the county
now shows that this is beginning to need
more water. It will stand another week
or ten days without serious injury.- In
the foothills and near them fruit trees
' are in full blossom. In the lower vahey
I they are budding rapidly, some trees be
ing in bloom. ' â¢_â¢ ' â¢ -â  "y~: : ."'
MARYSVILLE, March 1 Last night
there were frequent showers, the precipi
tation measuring .22 of an inch, making
the rainfall for the season 8.5 inches. The
prospects are for more to-night.
WOODLAND, March There was a
slight shower of rain Monday night, dur
ing which the precipitation amounted to
.OS of an inch, making a total of 9.03
inches for the season.
MILTON, March I.â Cloudy weather,
with occasional slight showers, has pre
vailed here to-day. The wind is now com
ing from the southeast, the rainy quar
ter, and hopes are entertained of a good
rainfall. Grain is growing nicely in this
section and is not suffering for rain, but
feed is very short, owing to the early
frosts and long contlnuned dry spell. â¢
MONTEREY, March Warm, . soak
ing rain began falling throughout this sec
tion after midnight last night and has not
ceased. Although . the precipitation is
slight, the rain has been of inestimable
benefit to hay, grain, fruit and pasture in
this locality, and if continued for twenty
four hours will be the salvation of the
crops.
STOCKTON, March I.â lt began rain-

SANTA CRUZ. March I.â Showers fell
to-day. The prospects this evening are
favorable for a heavy downpour.
"WALNUT CREEK, March Lâ Since last
night a half-Inch of rain has fallen in this
valley. While the crops were not suffer
ing, they are greatly benefited.
SAN DIEGO, March I.â The rainfall at
this point thus â¢ far this season Is 3.73
inches, while in the grain-growing sec
tions back . from the coast it has been
twice as much. Grain throughout tha
county is vigorous and continued rains
within ten days will insure a good crop.
Two inches of snow fell at Cuyamaca
during the past week and light showers
fell in other parts of the county. De
ciduous fruits are doing well and trees
are. blossoming-. The weather officials
look for rain this week. 7'". 7: - -
SUISUN, March 1. â Rain commenced
falling in this vicinity about midnight and
has continued at intervals. The prospects
are exceedingly good for a continued
downpour. The precipitation will be of
incalculable benefit to orchardlsts and
farmers and grazing lands will be ma
terially benefited.
I.OS ANGELES. March The sky Is
cloudy and threatening, with conditions
favorable for rain to-night. For the past
week the weather has been cool, and light
showers In the southern part of the State
and heavy fogs in the coast districts have
kept the grain looking remarkably well,
though a heavy rainfall is badly needed.
If no rain falls within the next two weeks
the grain will suffer greatly. The early
fruits are blossoming rapidly. A rain is
badly needed also to fill, the reservoirs
and supply places for Irrigation.

AN EXCELLENT COMBINATION.
The pleasant method and beneficial
j effects of the well-known remedy,
Syrup of Figs, manufactured by the
â  California Fig Syrup Company, illus-
! trates the value of obtaining the liquid
i laxative principles of plants known to
be medicinally laxative and presenting
1 them in the form most refreshing to
! the taste and acceptable to the system.
It is the one perfect strengthening lax-
ative, cleansing the system effectually,
i dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
'â  gently yet promptly, and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
i every objectionable quality and sub-
stance and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative. -t .? \
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
i taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
! remedy are obtained from senna and
i other aromatic plants by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
I Company only. In order to get its ben-
I eficial effects and to avoid Imitations,
please remember the full name of the

BLOOD STAINS
CANNOT BE
WASHED AWAY
Lillian Brandes' Skull Proves a
Boomerang for the
Defense.
Testimony of Experts Produced by the Attoi
neys for the Accused Man Strengthens
the Prosecution.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, March 1.
The blood that stains the skull of the j
dead Lillian Brandes cannot be washed i
away, and the introduction by the defense
to-day of the grewsome object, together
with a telescope basket full of other
skulls, has acted as a boomerang in the
trial of William A. Brandes, charged with
his daughter's murder.
The most intense Interest was mani
fest this morningwhen the defense opened
its batteries, with Dr. E. H. Wooisey as
its chief medical expert. The aged doctor
contradicted himself in at least seven in
stances of vital Importance, and addition
al links. in the chain of evidence against
the accused were forged.
When Dr. Wooisey appeared on the wit
ness stand he was accompanied by a bas
ket of skulls, precious relics, as he called
them, that he had gathered after years
of labor. District Attorney Allen and his
able assistant, Harry Melvin. objected to
their introduction as evidence, but Judge
Hall admitted the whole hatch of grew
some objects. Dr. Wooisey then delivered
an interesting lecture on human anatomy,
pathology and the conditions he found on
the body of the dead giri. Briefly, he de
nied that there were any pronounced
bruises on the face or the limbs. The
pathological conditions beneath the scalp
and the extravasations, her said, were no
more than often occurs in ordinary
deaths. He went even further, saying
there was nothing, in the way of lacera
tions or abrasions that might not have
been made by the saws and chisels of the
autopsy physici â¢-â¢.'.
Hypothetical questions, each covering
several typewritten sheets of paper, such
as is used on machines, were put by At
torney Bennett, and, in short, the gist of
Dr. Woolsey's testimony was that Lillian
Brandes could not have lived from Tues
day. when the alleged fatal blows were
struck, until the following Saturday as
suming that she was suffering from con
cussion, shock and meningitis. Witness
stated, not simply as an opinion, but as
an absolute fact, that Lillian Brandes died
from hanging.
Dr. Woolsev at one stage of the direct
examination held that "the extravasa
tions and the alleged bruises were the
result of congestion of the blood during
the process of hanging." Later on he
testified that these marks, bruises, mot
tled appearance of the limbs and extrava
sations were, in his opinion, post-mortem,
clearly contradicting himself.
"Any blow upon the head that might
have caused such extravasation," said the
doctor, "would have smashed the skull,
and in this case the majority of symptoms
are those found In hanging." The slight
depression found on Lillian's scalp even
might be characteristic of apoplexy, suf
focation or strangulation by hanging.
Frequently Deputy District Attorney
Melvin was moved to object to questions
asked as being leading, when It was clear
that witness needed no leading.
The same black and blue marks which
Dr. Woolsev testified as being post-mor
tem were shown by the prosecution to
have been bruises which Brandes had told
Deputy Coroner Streightlff had been in
flicted by Mrs. Brandes when she whipped
Lillian a few days prior to her death.
The prosecution wasted no time in
cross-examining Dr. Wooisey. He was
simply asked whether he had not agreed,
when he and Bennett called at the un
dertaking parlors ln Berkeley to examine
the body. to not mutilate the remains and
leave them as he found them. This ques
tion was repeated four times, and each
time answered in the negative, the last
time Dr. Wooisey adding that any state
ment to the contrary made by Deputy
Coroner Streightiff or Washington Wilson
was "a base fabrication." Witness ad
mitted that he had obtained no order or
permit from the Coroner to remove the
skull cap of Lillian Brandes. With that,
to the surprise of the attorneys for the
defense, the prosecution dismissed the de
fense's chief expert witness, whose sur
prise was perhaps greater than that of
any one in the courtroom. "; : - _,
It was during the direct examination of
the next witness. Dr. G. L. Eaton, whose
testimony was for the most part also
along the line of the theory of suicide by
hanging, that Dr. H. S. Buteau. chief ex
pert and autopsy physician for the prose
cution, stepped into the courtroom. He
was handed the skull cap of the dead
girl. It was the first. time he had seen It
since the autopsy. When Attorney Ben
nett last week asked Dr. Buteau on the
stand why he had not preserved the skull
i and membranes, being aware that the life
of a man depended upon it, the surgeon
and expert answered: " r ..
"I did what I considered was much
safer I summoned half a dozen reputable
physicians of Berkeley to witness the
autopsy, and they can tell what they
saw; but I should have preserved it had
I known that It would have fallen into
disreputable hands afterward."
While Dr. Eaton was testifying Dr.
Buteau fumbled the skullcap and ex
amined it closely, and made a discovery
that will result in his being recalled by
the prosecution. That discovery con
sisted of the important fact that the
blood spots on the skull cannot be re
moved. ' ._â "Â«_ *"x i
Dr Butead, accompanied by Deputy
District Attorney Melvin. unnoticed by
the' attorneys for the defense, took the
skull to an anteroom and made a desper
ate effort to remove the blood with water,
but this could not be accomplished with
out destroying and also removing the tis
sue clearly proving In Dr. Buteau's
oDinion the fact of the blood stains being
ante-mortem. To this Dr. Buteau will
testify when recalled, y-.y-y'-:: â .' - . *
It is believed now that the Introduction
of the skull, though objected to by the
prosecution, will prove of material value
In securing the conviction of Brandes.
MRS. R. W. SNOW GOES
TO HER FINAL REST
Wife of the Auditor and Republican
Candidate for Mayor Passes
Away in Ojai Valley.
OAKLAND, March I.â Mrs. R. W. Snow.
wife of the City Auditor, died last night
at the residence of relatives in Southern
California. Mr. Snow and daughter left
Oakland on Monday night, in response to
an urgent summons, and arrived in Ojai
Valley just a few hours before her death.
Mrs. Snow had been in failing health for
. some time, but although it was known
that her sickness might terminate fatally,
the end was not expected for some weeks.
The life of the deceased in this city
had been one of activity? benevolence and
usefulness; but her sphere was that of a
noble woman who preferred to work in
the home and away from the eyes of the
world rather than seek notoriety and pub
lic approval. For many years Mrs. Snow
was the secretary of the Ladles' Aid So
ciety of the First Congregational Church,
and her duties, conscientiously performed,
were productive of much that will be re
' membered for years.
.Although a sufferer for two years, only
two months ago did Mrs. Snow leave for
the south, even then not thinking . that
she was bidding Oakland farewell forever.
The funeral will be : held to-morrow I in
Ojai Valley, and the remains will : be In
. terred In the family plat, where within
the past year a brother and sister have
been buried. ' .7
Mr. Snow is the Republican candidate
for Mayor, and in his sorrow he has the
sincere sympathy of all parties, who rea
lize that others must carry on till March
13 the campaign he so valiantly started.
In a political speech in West Oakland
to-night ex-Mayor J. L. Davie referred
very feelingly to the bereavement of Mr.
Snow. '

DOW WILL
DEFEND THE
WATER FRONT
Has an Amendment
to the Bill.
PROTECTING THE CITY'S TITLE
SENATOR LEAVITT SAYS IT IS
ALL BIGHT.
The City Council Is Not Satisfied
That the Creation of a Harbor '
Commission "Will Be a
Benefit.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 1.
The bill now before the Legislature
providing for the creation of a commis
sion to manage Oakland harbor has cre
ated much unrest among the attorneys
who are watching the important water
front case now in the courts. They do
not feel assured that the bill is for the
best interests of the city and declare
that they see in it a possibility of hurt
ing the city's case. Some weeks ago
these attorneys supplied an opinion to
the City Council in which they set forth
that the result of such a bill as Is pro
posed might have the effect of casting a
cloud on the city's title, and to that ex
tent hurt its cause.
The City Council and other bodies de
clared against the passage of the bill and
resolutions to this effect were sent to the
Alameda County legislators asking them
to have the bill amended in certain par
ticulars. A reply was received from Sen
ator Leavitt, the. author of the bill, tell
ing the Council that it did not under
stand the situation and that there is no
necessity for alarm. â¢ 7
City Attorney Dow, in conjunction with
"William R. Davis, W. Lair Hill and 11.
A. Powell, has prepared a short amend
ment to the bill and to-night some of
these attorneys left for Sacramento to
argue in favor of the amendment before
the Legislature. They have prepared a
died. General Shaffer spoke of thÂ©
hearty co-operation of the naval forces
and paid a glowing tribute to the
commanders of the vessels whose guns
swept the shores, clearing the way for
the advancing columns of soldiers. It
was a glorious victory, he said, where
a province was won without the loss
of a gun, a prisoner, or. a color.
At the close of the general's speech
the legion sang "When Shafter Comes
Marching Homo."
In reply, to a toast to the navy,
Commodore Watson responded by a
tribute to the gallant Dewey, the men
tion of whose name, lifted the members
of the Loyal Legion to their feet with
loud cheers for the hero of Manila.
Horace Davis spoke for the Sons of
the Revolution, and ; ended his eloquent
remarks by stating that the patriotic
civilian preached war while the sol
dier and sailor practiced with . tneir
guns. -..-.â 'â :â â¢' ' ' "*' , 'â '- '' ' '
Captain Terry of the lowa responded
for his vessel, and stated j that he was .
not permitted to i command I the lowa
during her exploits at Santiago. There
were not enough ships to go , around,
consequently some of the navy ; men
had to stay at home. "At the close of
Captain Terry's remarks the company
sang feelingly, 7 "Remember the
Maine." . â "â¢â â 
printed statement setting forth their ob
jections to the original bill and showing
why it should be amended.
The amendment is as follows:
"Nothing contained in th s act shall be
construed to impair any title which the
city of Oakland has or may have to said
water front, or any part thereof nor to
â¢affect the rights or standing of said city
in or connected with any litigation now
or hereafter pending in which tho title
to or control of said water front is or
may be Involved." . _-. 'â¢ _. *
City Attorney Dow said this afternoon
that 'the proposed amendment is neces
sary and should be passed to preserve to
this city all that she has fought for and
expended so much to gain. Mr. Dow is
prepared to show the alleged weakness of
the original bill and has little doubt that
he will be able In conjunction with the
other attorneys to secure the passage, of
the amendment. '
ENDANGERED THE
LIVES OF LINEMEN
Alameda Office San Francisco Call.
1428 Park street, March 1.
' Alameda's political contest promised to
be a campaign of placards until the candi
dates were threatened with arrest for
pasting. their pictures and tacking their
announcements on every available space
in town.
Probably no objection would have been
made had not the candidates swooped
down on the electric light masts and com
pletely covered them with cards with
glowing announcements. A lineman who
attempted to climb one of the poles and
nearly broke his neck caused the trouble.
His steel spurs struck several tacks that
refused to yield, and the lineman came
down the pole like the time ball on the
ferry depot building. â¢â¢
Fortunately he was not injured, and he
went to City Clerk Lamborn and threat
ened to sue the city for damages to his
nervous system if It allowed the office
seekers to stick full -of tacks the poles he
had to climb. : V .
No arrests have vet been made, but the
City Clerk stated to-day that he had no
tilled the police department of the law
against placarding tne town, and expected
the officers would enforce the provisions
of the ordinance.
"Unquestionably if a lineman got hurt
while climbing those poles by reason of
their being tilled with tacks, in violation
of an ordinance that had not been prop
erly enforced, the city could be held for
damages," said Mr. Lamborn. "The city
has one damage suit on its hands nowâ
the Devoust caseâ we do not want an
other." ' *.
Some of the candidates have torn down
their announcements, and in every in
stance they have been very careful to re
move the tacks. -. _1?7
A RIOTER LAID LOW.

For several days the "doctors" have been
giving free concerts and disposing of their
medicines on a vacant lot at "Ninth and
Clay streets. There has been some fric
tion the last few evenings owing to the
behavior of some young fellows in- the
audience. , . ' ._ , _
â¢These fellows appeared* to take offense
at some of the number, of the programme
carried out on the four-horse wagon, and
tho comedian retorted. Gradually the ill
feeling increased and when the leader of
the gang cried "Fight!" they attempted
to drive the so-called doctors out of the
wagon. Several pistols were produced
and used as clubs, but no shots were fired.
The driver beat the gang off the wagon,
and it was in this way that Haanstra was
injured. The -chairs in the wagon wen
thrown out, causing great excitement and
some bruises, and the riot was only
quelled when the driver lashed up the four
horses and dashed to the City Hall. There
was great excitement for a time and it Is
surprising that more people were not
hurt. Haanstra Is in a semi-stupor at the
hospital, and it is feared he has been se
riously injured. - â  7, ;-â >
Shortly before midnight five of the lead
ers of the riotâ Frank Young, Antone Hi
guera. Charles Buker, James McCloskey
and John Dohertyâ were * arrested and
locked up at the City Prison on charges
of violating the curfew ordinance and dis
turbing the peace. The lads range In
age from 11 to 18 years. Harry Rogers,
the driver of the wagon, was also ar
rested and will be detained awaiting the
developments in Haanstra's condition.
Rogers is 52 years old. There were about
fifty boys implicated in the riot.

ACCUSED OF
EMBEZZLEMENT
BY RELATIVES
Rosie Cornelia Spends
Mother's Money.
ENTERTAINS HER FRIENDS
AMY SMITH SWEARS OUT A
WARRANT FOR A BROTHER.
â  * . â¢
She Charges Her Relative and His
Wife With Embezzling Her
Savings, Intrusted to
Their Care.
, By a singular coincidence two cases of
near relatives being accused of doing
away with considerable money entrusted
to their care came to the notice of the
police yesterday, which was rather an
unusual occurrence.
Mrs. Kate Cornelia, a widow living at
'_2*_ August alley, called upon Chief Lees
with her uaugbter Rosie, who was in the
custody of a policeman. Mrs. Cornelia
stated that until a few months ago she
was possessed of $1800, which she had de
posited with the San Francisco Union
and Savings Company. In October last
she withdrew the money from the bank
and kept it hidden in her house. Then
she decided to again deposit it in the
bank, and personally deposited $700. The
Remainder she gave to her daughter,
Rosie, to deposit. The girl showed her
the bank book with entries of the various
Bums, amounting to $1100, and it was not
till yesterday morning thatÂ«she discovered
the entries were forged and that the girl
had not deposited the money. She re
fused to say what she had done with it,
â¢and Mrs. Cornelia determined to punish
her for her treachery. _'-"_.i"' _
The girl, when questioned, admitted
making the false entries In the bank book,
and said she had spent the $1100 in treat
ing her friends to dinners in restaurants
and presents of silk, pet dogs and articles
of bric-a-brac. She had also given $200 to
a neighbor. Mrs. Cornelia was told that
she could swear to a warrant for her
daughter's arrest for embezzlement, but
after thinking over the matter she was
.waved by her daughter's tears, and said
she "would make up her mind by to-day.
Mother and daughter went away together.
The other case was that of Miss Amy
Smith, 1087 Mission street. She swore to
a complaint in Judge Mogan's court yes
terday charging her brother, Joseph B.
Smith, and his wife, Luella. with felony
embezzlement. She Is a domestic, and
claims that for some years past she has
given her brother her earnings to invest
â¢for her, amounting altogether to about
**500
* On Tuesday she asked him what he had
done with the money, and he and his wife
laughed at her and refused to give her
any satisfaction. She made inquiry and
ascertained that her brother had with
her money built a house on M street.
South San Francisco, and to prevent her
from obtaining it had homesteaded it.
What angered her was that on several oc
casions when she asked her brother how
he invested the money he had shown her
the outside of a bank book and had led
her to believe that he had deposited the
money in a bank in her name.
RICH SYLVANITE ORES.
George L. Carr Tells of Discoveries in j
Trinity County.
'George L. Carr. the prominent mine |
Owner of Carrville, who is staying at the
Buss, reports several discoveries of rich
.sylvanite ores near Coffee Creek in Trin
ity County. He brought a number of
samples from mines now being operated
one from the Red Flag, owned by E. A.
Wagner and himself, assaying $150. ; Ore
from the same claim will average $1500 j
to the ton. The ore carries both sylvan- !
He and tellurium and is the same as the j
Hill ore, which has paid as high as $8000
. a ton. , 1;
. Another sample is from the Burner mine
which the owner works one month in
every twelve, taking out enough gold in ,
a shaft, which is down 125 feet, to keep
himself and a large family for the rest of
the year.
â¢ At the Golden Jubilee mine some rich
ore has been extracted which Is worth
. over a thousand dollars a ton. much of it
having been shipped to Selby's. From the
Forget-Me-Not mine ore has been taken
out running $1332.
One of the most promising mines is the
property of Mr. Carr and called the Bowl
der, from the number of bowlders scat
tered around on the ground, weighing
from ten to fifteen tons and carrying gold
In value from $7 to $800 to the ton. A tun
nel has been run in for 1300 feet and the
ore taken therefrom assays from $2 to $9
per ton in gold.
The sylvanite discoveries are attracting
widespread attention, and it is expected

' Refuge for Widows and Orphans of
7* â¢" 'Â»- Departed Brothers.
The handsome Masonic Home at De- j
coto. Alameda County, formally opened
it's doors yesterday to the widows and
orphans of Masons. There was no demon
stration, and the opening was marked
with little ceremony.
At 1C o'clock the directors assembled
-In the parlors of the institution and were
welcomed by Dr. I. R. Aiken, the superin
tendent, and Mrs. Aiken. They then
visited every apartment of the building
and made a thorough inspection, satisfy
ing themselves that the home was com
plete In every detail.
The das' was one of unusual interest for
the Masonic fraternity, the new home
being the pride of the order. It was first
proposed in 1891, and steps for its estab
lishment were soon after taken by the
Grand Lodge of California, The corner
. stone was laid on October 14, 1896, and the
â¢ present structure was dedicated at the
fast convention of the Grand Lodge.

Pine street, will be glad to learn that
the establishment has outgrown its old
quarters and will open next Saturday
night in a new home at 126 and 128 Geary
street. Great credit is due the enterpris
ing proprietor, Mr. N. P. Loupy, Tor the
' careful and elaborate preparations he has
made for the reception and convenience
of his guests. The new place is a three- ;
story building. The main dining-room,
large enough to accommodate 250 guests,
is on the first floor, while the banquet
hall, seating sixty people, with private
apartments and suites of rooms, occupy
the second and third stories.
All the furnishing is new throughout
the entire establishment and is in ex
cellent taste. A private entrance Is from
119 Union Square avenue.
The prices will be the same as before,
the specialty still being the 50-cent din
ner. The rule will be, too, as before,
that nothing but the best of everything
is good enough for the patrons of the Ne

JACOB EGGERTSEN GOES
TO JOIN HIS DEAD WIFE
A RESTAURANT PROPRIETOR
HANGS HIMSELF.
Mrs. Bora Fuhrig Accused of Mal
practice by the Dying Woman,
but Escapes Conviction.
Jacob Eggertsen, proprietor of the res
taurant at 507 Fourth street, hanged him
self some time. last Tuesday night in his
room and was found dead yesterday
morning. -t';^ " ?__â¦
Eggertsen's story is a sad one. L<ast
September Anna Eggertsen, the wife of
the deceased, was taken to McNutt s Hos
pital in a dying condition. She made a
deathbed statement to the physicians
that her precarious condition was due to
an operation performed by Mrs. Dora
Fuhrig. She died on the Sth of that
month, and the Coroner's jury charged
Mrs. Fuhrig with her murder.
Mrs. Fuhrig has money. When brought
before the lower court she was acquitted
in spite of the dying accusation made by
Mrs Eggertsen, and despite the fact that
she was under indictment for the alleged
murder of three other women.
Eggertsen took the matter of the ac
quittal very much to heart and began
drlnkine heavily. He dearly loved his
wife and ills grief because of her loss
wis inexpressible and equaled only by his
desire to see justice meted out to the wo
man whom hi believed to be the cause of
he a t i h nee the acquittal he kept himself
under the influence of liquor. Only a day
o? two before his death he told two of his
waitresses Ella My rick and Isabella Mc

A SOCK IS A DEADLY WEAPON.
A Deputy Sheriff Almost Killed by
Being. Struck With One.
Is a man's sock a deadly weapon? Su
preme Court Commissioner R. Y. Hayne,
after struggling with this question for
some time, decided that under certain cir
cumstances it is. The Supreme Justices
reviewed his opinion and came to the con
clusion that the Commissioner is right.
The case out of . which this important
question arose came from Butte County,
where John J. Valliere was sentenced to
fourteen years in the State Prison for as
saulting Deputy Sheriff John Boyle with
a deadly weapon with intent to. commit
murder. The accused was a prisoner un
der sentence originally for burglary and
he made an attempt to. escape from jail.
To do so he had to get the jailer's keys,
and when Boyle went to the cell he was
struck with a sock and the blow made
him see stars.
At the trial Dr. Grey was called as an
expert on deadly weapons, and he was
asked the question: "Coujd a man kill an
other with that bag?" meaning the sock;
also, "Is that a deadly weapon?" To the
first the doctor answered: "I presume that
would depend altogether on the portion
of the body it came in contact with, and
the force used."
Judge Hayne In quoting. the law says:
"A deadly weapon is one that Is likely to
produce death or great bodily injury." The
judgment of the lower court was affirmed
and a retrial of the case denied, inasmuch
as the stocking In question .was loaded
with a mixture of salt and niortar moist
ened with water to make It solid. ."_â ,",

SMALL DAMAGE FOR
SERIOUS INJURIES
BESSIE HENEY WINS HER SUIT
AGAINST MRS. WILSON. . \
Because the Coffee Was Not Good the
Young Plaintiff Received a Beat
ing That Made Her a
Cripple for Life.
Little Bessie Heney, pronounced a hope
less cripple by her physicians, hobbled
into court yesterday to prosecute her suit
against Delphine Wilson and her husband,
J. A. Wilson, for damages in the sum of
$5000. Mrs. Wilson was the principal de
fendant, although the law demanded that
her husband be joined as such with her,
and he was.
The youthful plaintiff was employed by
the Wilsons as a domestic in their home,
1110 . Larkin street. One morning Mrs.
Wilson complained of the quality of the
coffee. Bessie was scolded, but said little,
and finally Mrs. Wilson's anger overcame
her, and she beat the girl unmercifully,
it was proved in court, although Mrs.
Wilson avers that she simply took the
girl and gently but firmly put her out of
the house. Bessie, after she had been
so abused, left the Wilson residence and
went to the home of some relatives. A
warrant was sworn out for the arrest of
Mrs. Wilson, and she was taken into cus
tody. She stood trial and was convicted,
notwithstanding a vigorous defense.
Judge Campbell, who tried the case, fined
her $10. Then a civil suit for damages
was filed against Mrs. Wilson and her
husband.
All day yesterday a jury listened to the
testimony Introduced by the plaintiff and
defendant. Reel B. Terry, for the plain
tiff, made a strong plea for his - little
client. The defense followed in argument,
â¢arid the case was submitted. The jury
was out but a few minutes, and returned
a verdict in plaintiff's favor for the sum
of $500. The verdict justified the bringing
of suit, but does not compensate for one
hour of the hundreds that Bessie has suf
fered since she was beaten because the
coffee was not the same as usual. .
SPORTSMEN ARE INDIGNANT.
Dissatisfied With the Police Judges
in the Fish Cases. '
The Fish and Game Commissioners are
highly indignant over the way in which
the Police Court Judges are dealing with
fish dealers arrested for violating the
laws. Several months ago four dealers
were taken into custody for selling
striped bass weighing less than three
pounds, which is prohibited. In the case
of the one arrested on Market street, an
employe of Paladinl, the evidence of the
sale was conclusive, but according to
Commissioner Alex Vogelsang, Judge Mo
gan dismissed the case on the ground
that it was the man's first offense.
"The facts are," said Mr. Vogelsang,
"that the man was only working for Pa
ladinl, who has been in trouble with the
officers on many occasions - for violating
the law. If the man was fined the em
ployer would have to pay the penalty,
and he Is the one we are after.
"There are four other cases, and from
what I can learn one of the Police Judges
went to Departments and asked that
one or more of the law breakers be given
the lowest fine of $20,, with no alterna
tive. This means that, he will neither
pay the fine nor go to jail for failing to
do so. If this is the manner by which
these Police Judges are -paying their po
litical debts, I have to say that they are
making a great mistake: -On account- of
the stand Judges Mogan and Conlan took
before, the election in .the-;. wild duck and
other cases, the sportsmen of this city
rallied to their support. Now the sports
men are as indignant as the Commission
ers, and it is very .-likely, that the sports
men will . take some, action â¢ to ..- show
whether they or the fish sellers have the
most influence. â¢.,.-.
"The facts are that- the State has spent
considerable money in importing these
bass from the East and ' the law is not
unjust in placing the limit at three
pounds, when the fish grow to weigh as
much as fifty pounds. The Commission
ers are spending * the State's ; money . to
uphold the law and certainly . have . the
right ,to expect that the Judges will give
their assistance in punishing those who
openly violate the statutes.
"If this trifling .is continued certain of
the Police Judges-may. .find' themselves
explaining their actions to the Grand
Jury." . ; .-;."-,

ACCUSES HER
GUARDIAN OF
GROSS FRAUD
Carrie- E. Sankey's
Charges. '
SUIT AGAINST C.S. COGGINS
SEEKS TO REGAIN POSSESSION
OF HER LARGE ESTATE,
Says Her Protector, by Threats and
Intimidation, Forced Her to
Transfer All Her Property
to Him.
Carrie E. Sankey, who several years ago
appeared in the Probate Court as the con
testant to the will of -her deceased step
father, Samuel Sankey, who died In the
East November 23, 1886, appeared again
as plaintiff before Judge Belcher yester
day and renewed her battle for her pa
rent's property. -
Shortly after Sankey died his will was
filed In this city for probate. In the doc
ument his adopted, daughter was cut off
with $40.: She immediately filed a contest
and after a bitter legal light the will .was
ordered revoked- and the contestant
awarded the entire estate In litigation.
â¢At the time -of- her -first victory Miss
Sankey was but 16 years of age, and hav
ing no knowledge of business Charles S.
Coggins was appointed her guardian.
From time to time transfers of property
from Miss Sankey to ' Coggins were re
corded, deeds for property in this city
and Chicago were drawn up and signed
by the young girl, and as she grew poorer
Coegins grew richer.
Now Miss Sankey appears in court and,
through a series of allegations, tells the
story of how she came to transfer the
property to her guardian for little or no
consideration. First, she avers that not
long after the property was placed in the
care of Coggins he and his wife, Mary E.
Coggins, began to plot with the object of
swindling her out of her estate. They told
her, she says, that she was guilty of a
heinous crime, the crime consisting of
entertaining a young man, nothing more,
and that if she refused to place her es
tate in their hands they would expose her
and bring upon her the contempt of the
world. Young, Inexperienced and friend
less, and fearful that perhaps her guar
dian and his wife would do her injury,
but how she did not know, she says that
she yielded and signed the documents pre
sented her for that purpose and trans
ferred her lands and personal belongings
to those who threatened her. .
Many other allegations of conspiracy
and fraud are set forth, and in conclusion
the young woman askes that the defend
ants be adjudged guilty of fraud; that
the court revoke all gifts made by her to
them, and that she have an accounting
and judgment against the defendants for
all moneys that have come Into their
hands and have been . appropriated by
them for their use.

STREET DEPARTMENT IN
â¢â¢â  A CRIPPLED CONDITION
EACH OF FUNDS HAMPERS THE
WORK OF FRAGEEY.
Laborers and Merchants Must Wait
Until June for Payment of
Their Claims. ; T
Auditor Asa R. Wells formally notified
! the Supervisors yesterday as to the stand
he takes regarding the finances of the
Street Department. He refuses to assume
the responsibility for auditing the bills of
| the Street Department for December or
January,
According to his attorneys the only
course for the Supervisors to pursue Is
Ito ignore for the present the bills for
; this month. They cannot be paid now
with money that will be presumably on
I hand at the end of the fiscal year. In his
j letter to the board he says:
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors
Gentlemen: After carefully considering the
I condition of the street fund, I am advised
by my attorney that I cannot, at this time,
safely pay bills for that department back
of the present month of FeDruary. Re
spectfully yours,
. ASA R. WELLS, Auditor.
The bills amount to $34,762. Of this
$27,702 Is due laboring men for work on
the public streets, while the balance are
! contract bills. From appearances there
; will be a surplus in various funds at the
j end of the fiscal year in June. This will
I permit of a general balancing of accounts
I between funds showing a surplus and
I those having a deficit. The Auditor can
; not foresee what the surplus will amount
; to, hence his declination to juggle with
J funds at this early date.
The condition is different from that
! which obtains in the School Department.
I There it is generally conceded the money
| due teachers and merchants for Novem
ber and December is lost beyond recov
i cry. On present calculations there will
be ample funds on hand to satisfy the
l claims against the Street Department.
The Street Committee meets this morn
ing, and may devise a way out of the dif
ficulty.
