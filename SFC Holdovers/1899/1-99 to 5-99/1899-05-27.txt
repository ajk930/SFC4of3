that California's tribute to the hero

calling upon the multitude's for their

KILLED BY LIGHTNING
WHILE PREACHING
Awful Death of Rev. H. H. Baldwin
While Conducting Revival
Services in Oklahoma.
NEW YORK, May 26.-A special to the
Bun from Guthrle, O. T., says: Rev, , H.
H. Baldwin, an aged preacher, was killed
by lightning while conducting religious
hers.. at Fountain, in Dewey County,
last night. For a week he had been con
ducting a revival, and the little church
was crowded yesterday. He gave out the
hymn and led in prayer, and then went
to the Bible and gave out bis text. Then
the storm broke. He appealed to' the con
gregation to lead better lives and to feel
spiritual calm after a life of sin, the
roughness and turbulence of which he
compared with the violence of the storm
raging out of doors.
Just then the crash of thunder came,
while a brilliant flash almost blinded those
in the front pews. When they recovered
from the confusion the minister lay on
the floor dead. The congregation was in
a great state of fear, and the men in the
audience, mostly cattlemen, feared to ap
proach the body for some minutes.
Women screamed and some fainted.
Mr. Baldwin had been living in the Ter
ritory several years. He came from ll
nois.
AN APPEAL TO AID

to the other financial matters.
Captain Fletcher submitted
sign for a Bouvenir receipt,
was adopted with a few slight al
terations suggested by the mem
bers present. The souvenir is a
marvel of artistic elegance and will
long be cherished by the fortunate
ssors.
Then the question of raising funds
was brought up and it was decided
after some discussion as to the best
method of proceeding, that it
would be advisable to go before the
people with a positive assurance of
the success of the movement in the
shape of a sufficient sum pledged to
dispel all doubt. Mayor Phelan an
nounced that although First
Vice President Claus Spreckela
has been out of town for
some days, and consequently
unable to attend the meetings
of the committee so far, he had
sent word to the Mayor that he
would be happy to send in his sub
scription to the fund as soon as the
committee was in readiness to re
ceive It. The Mayor was requested
to send a telegram to Mr. Spreckels
inviting him to head the list. The
dispatch was sent and promptly
came the reply that Mr. Spreckels
would head the list with $10,000.
Mayor Phelan told the committee
that he was anxious to pay $5000
for one" of those souvenir receipts;
another member announced that
John W. Mackay's check for a
similar amount was awaiting
the committee's pleasure, and still
another stated that "a friend"
who modestly declined to
have his name made public
just at present was ready
with the third $5000 subscription.

WHEN DOES THE 19TH
CENTURY CLOSE
This Question Takes the Presbyterian
Assembly Longer to Decide Than
the Roberts Case.
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., May 26.â 1t took
the general assembly of the Presbyterian
church longer to decide to-day when the
nineteenth century ends than it took to
pass the resolution against the Mormon
Congressman Roberts and in favor of
the anti-polygamy amendment to the na
tional constitution. These resolutions,
which represent the matured thought of
the Presbyterians of the United States
after many months of consideration, so
exactly expressed the sentiment of every
conunisisoner that they were adopted
without even a single supporting speech.
The commisslone rs generally feel that in
calling for the expulsion of Roberts and
for the adoption of an amendment to the
national constitution detlning legal mar
riage to be monogamic they have started
a movement which will be taken up all
over the country and will reach event
ual success. The adopted resolutions were
originally written bÂ» K<-v. William Paden
of Salt Lake City, but were modified arid
expanded by the committee on bills and
overtures, though not essentially.
As for the end of the nineteenth cen
tury, one of the reports spoke of next
year as the opening of the new century.
I'pon objection and after a little debatt
the stated clerk held that next year is the
last of this century. Presbyterians will
henceforth get along without this exciting
topic of discussion.
DEWEY AMAZED MY
LAVISH PREPARATIONS
NEW YORK, May 27.â The World's
Hongkong corespondent cables he gave
Admiral Dewey to-day the first Informa
tion that the city of New York will ex
pend $150,000 and the State of New York
$7fi.000 in giving a fitting welcome to the
hero of Manila Bay. The Admiral said:
"I am amazcu at such lavish prepara

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, MAY 27. 1899.
with hearty applause, and the
members expressed themselves as
more than satisfied with the out
look. Some of them suggested that
the committee on design would
have to hurry up with Its work or
the money would all be collected
before the plans had been cum
plete 1.
With a quarter of the total
amount pledged at the start, the
committee felt that the people
would feel assured that the monu
ment was beyond the sentimental
stage and had become a reality, and
th"y would respond accordingly.
The city was divided into districts
and every member of the committee
assigned to one section with in
structions to make a most thorough
canvass for funds. Every bank and
insurance company, merchant and
broker, tradesman and professional
man will be called upon to contrib
ute. As the Dewey monument is a
State affair the country is looked to
for support as well as the city, and
for the benefit of those living out of
town as well as residents of the
outlying districts all the local news
papers have been authorized to re
ceive subscriptions. The commit
tee will appoint no collectors and
nobody aside from the business of
fices of the daily papers and the
members of the committee them
selves is authorized to collect sub
scriptions. If you are not nerson
ally acquainted with some member
of the committee the best plan is
for you to drop into one of the
newspaper offices and leave your
contribution or write to the com
mittee for a subscription blank,
which has been prepared and will
be sent to you. Fill this out and
send it in and one of the committee
will call upon you.

raise the second $25,000 in equally as
short a time.
RECOVERS THE BOY
HE MOURNED AS DEAD
Kidnaped Son of T. S. Gardiner Found
With a Family at Otter
Bay.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 26.â The
seven-year-old son of T. S. Gardiner, said
to be a merchant of San Francisco, was
discovered to-day by the police in the pos
session of Samuel Cawker, who lives at
Otter Bay. Three months ago the Gardi
ner boy mysteriously disappeared from
Seattle, where his father had placed him
in a private family. It was learned thai
he had been stolen while on the way to
school, but the father persisted in the be
lief that be was dead. So certain was he
of this that he wrote to a firm of under
takers in this city, asking if they knew
anything about the boy having beeh bur
ied. They did not, and then the case was
placed in the hands of the police.
The boy, who is a bright little fellow,
was enticed away by his stepmother, who
â I' â¢ rted Gardiner two years ago. She
brought him to Vancouver, and here
treated him cruelly. Then she took him
to the Cawkers. which is an out of the
way place, and left him there, promising
to pay for his board. The child was thin
and emaciated. Nothing has been seen of
the stepmother since. She lived at the
place for a while, but used the child so
badly that Cawker, taking a fancy to the
boy, agreed to take care of him.
Oardlner is expected to arrive here next
week after his -son, who will be placed
again in the care of friends at Seattle.
GERMANS ARE JUBILANT.

BERLIN, May 26.â The newspapers
here are jubilating over what they term
Admiral Kautz's "recall."
The Lokal Anzelger says: This shows
anew the American Government's good
will to remove all obstacles to a peaceful
understanding. It also says that a third

ALLEN FRASER TALKS
By the Crudest Methods Indians
and Mexicans Have Taken
Out Fortunes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 26.â Allen G.
Fraser, who has gained prom
inence through having been the
first white man to enter the rich
placer dig-sings j n tne Santa
Clara district. 300 miles south of En
senada. In Lower California, is a fruit
grower, having his home at Arlington,
Riverside County, in an Interview with
James Irving, the assayer, Fraser said:
"I can fully confirm the reports of
discoveries of gold in the placer
grounds in the Santa Clara district.
The half has not been told, neither has
the greatest wealth in that section been
touched. These placer grounds have
been worked in a crude way by Indians
and Mexicans for many years. They
have used the simplest of appliances.
! In keeping with their nature they have
been very secretive. The large quan
tity of gold that came from the lnt< rior
had aroused much speculation, hence
the receni discovery.
"The find that I practically made
covers about fifteen square miles, but
there is another field that la equally
as rich several miles from the first that
has so far not been touched. The fu
ture alone can tell how much the dig
gings will yield. The output will run
i into the seven figures before it is ex
, hausted. Pres mi appliances are so im
perfect that the heaviest gold only is
taken out When modern dry washers
I are in operation the yield through Tiner
gold will rapidly swell the output.
"The lti(ii;ins with their methods took
"Ut from $1 to $20 a day. I have taken
up 250 acres and shall go back as soon
us I complete some business arrange
"One peculiar thing is that after dig
ging down two feet water is encoun
tered, and it iooks to me as if an un
derground swamp had at some time
existed. It is a peculiar condition and
one that offers opportunity for the
student. I think sufficient water can
be developed for all purposes."
Fraser says the process of taking up
claims is Blow and the Mexican Gov
ernment wiil not issue a certificate un
less the claim has been surveyed by the
proper persons. He knows nothing
personally of the $158,000 reported to
have been shipped to Guaymas. That
the report is true he does not deny,
because the field Is rich and the con
tributions of the many would soon
reach that figure if nuggets were in
cluded in the shipment.
The Santa Fe passenger department
is making preparations to accommodate
the travel expected from here. The
new El Dorado can he readied <>nly via
the Santa Fe from San Diego, and in
quiries as to rates and routes are nour
ing in upon the passenger department.
Work will at once be begun upon the
necessary printed matter, showing, in
detail how to reach the district. Kates
of fares will be quoted and dates of the
Bailing of steamers out of San Diego.
Should the bonanza pan out as has been
predicted, a regular passenger service
will be instituted from San Pedro down
the coast. The Southern Pacific pas
senger department may also recom
mend to headquarters at San Francisco
that a steamer line be placed in service
from Port Los Angeles.
THE STAMPEDE IS ON.
Schooner Anita to Take the First
Load of Gold-Seekers.
SAN DlE<;<>. May 26.â Scores of pen
pie are only awaiting an opportunity to
try their fortune in the Cerro Pinta
placers. Captain Dunne of the schooner
Anita, which will sail on Monday for
San Pablo Bay, has been besieged with
applications for passage on his vessel,
and application was made this morning
to the Board of Inspectors of Hulls at
San Francisco to allow the vessel to
take fifty passengers in addition to her
crew.
"We could book 250 passengers on
the Anita," said Agent Mendelson this
morning, "if we could only rind room
for them."
At noon to-day Mr. Mendelson re
ceived a dispatch authorizing the Anita
to take the additional passengers asked
for, and when the vessel sails she will
be loaded to the guards with passen
gers and freight for the placers.
Manager Swain of the Ibarra Mining
Company at Calmalli, who has a thor
ough knowledge of the country where
the excitement is on, believes implicitly
in the reports of the rich gold discov
eries at Sierra Pintada. and has given
local carpenters an unlimited order to
supply him all the dry washers they
can make by Monday at $25 each. They
will be taken down on the Anita, and
will sell at the mines for not less than
$150 each.
The St. Denis is being fitted up with
additional berths, and on her next trip
will go to Ascension Bay. She will
have accommodations for 100 passen
gers.
The next definite news from the
placers will be received by the Santa
Barbara, which is due at Ensenda
about May 30. The schooner was sent
south from that port with a full cargo
of provisions, and is expected to bring
back a quantity of gold.

Mr. Schurman expresed similar views

thereby caused the President to fall
Into the mistake of anticipating peace

The fact that the authorities have

a failure. I understand that the Twen
ty-fourth infantry (colored) has been
Blated for service in the Philippines in
addition to those previously decided
upon. Other regiments are also being
talked of.
ADDITIONAL TROOPS TO
BE SENT TO MANILA
WASHINGTON, May 26. - Additional
troops are to be sent to Manila in accord
ance with the War Department's policy
oi relieving the volunteer regiments as
litiously as circumstances will p> r
mit. Serious doubt it> entertained, how
<v. r. by some of the highest officials
whether it will be nracticable to muster
all volunteers out in view of the latest
developments. Receni instructions from
the War Department provide for the ciis
jatch of several reguiar regiments from
Francisco, the next to depart being
thr Ninth infantry, to be followed by the
first body of men next reaching the coast.
The question of garrisoning posts at
home is becoming a serious one, and
should all the volunteers in Manila be
mustered out on returning home, as they
are promised, the authorities will have
scarcely enough force to care for coast
fortifications and the more important mil
itary posts. It is thought that some of
the volunteer regiments would be willing
to continue in the service if relfeved of the
hard duty at the front in the Philippines.
I'ntil recently the brunt of the fighting
has been borne by these regiments, near
ly all of which are from the far West,
and previous to the insurgent outbreak
last February they conducted the patrol
work at Manila and vicinity. It is said
by War Department officials that the reg
ulars now in the Philippines with those
under orders to go there constitute over
one-third of the full enlisted strength and
that it is neither advisable nor practica
ble to reduce the force in Cuba and Porto
Rico in order to provide more regiments
for Manila.

NEW YORK, May 26.â Frank Moss,

she saw, heard and experienced during
the three months she was imprisoned in

told at length to Mr. Moss to-day. He
said when he had heard it that its recital

in London's prisons.
There are conditions, he s^aid, perhaps

DREYFUS SCORES HIS
PUBLIC PROSECUTORS
PARIS, May 26.â The Figaro pub
lishes to-day some notes written by
Dreyfus in November and December,
1894, when he was awaiting trial.
These in part are as follows:
Durinp the seventeen days following
my arrest I underwent several examina
tions. An officer came In the evenings
with his secretary, anger in his eyes and
insult on his lips. My overtasked brain
could not stand more.
I always asked what were the proofs of
the accusation, but he refused t" show
them, and said that the instrument of
my 80-called crime was a letter. Why
was l tiu; shown it? My condition be

Dreyfus goes oa to express astonish

disarmed because experts asserted that
his writing was similar to thai <>f the
incriminating letter. Throughout the
Investigation they said tn him: "You

To this he replied: "1 declare that a

toward me, a nameless act of coward

MANILA, May 26, 9:55 p. m.â
The Spanish general, Montero,
while on the way hither with
the Spanish garrison from Zam
boanga, on the steamer Leo
XIII, died from wounds receiv
ed in a recent engagement with
the Filipinos in Mindanao.
MADRID, May 26.â The Minister of
War, General Polavieja, has received
:i dispatch announcing the evacuation
i f Zamboanga, island of Mindanao, by
the Spanish garrison. The dispatch
further said that as the Spaniards had
declined to assent to the Filipinos' de
manda that the arms and munitions of
war should be surrendered with . the
city, fighting ensued, the Spaniards
suffering some loss.
The dispatch adds that the natives
continue bitterly opposed to the idea of
American annexation, and that the
conquest of Mindanao will prove to be
a hard task.
Following is the full text of the dis
patch which was sent by General Rios,
Spain's military representative in the
Philippines, from Manila:

The Filipino batteries at Zamboanga, '
Island of Mindanao, continued to shell the
town an<l the port, causing losses in our j
garrison, but finally after a lively attack
by the Spaniards the insurgents fled.
They Buffered numerous losses. Our
losses were two officers and three soldiers
killed and nineteen soldiers wounded.
One company of our troops attacked a I
battery, which the enemy then abandoned |
and two other batteries were dismounted |
by our artillery. After this reverse the
Insurgents declared their adhesion to !
Spain and suspended hostilities.

HENRY CLAY CHIPMAN
DIES AT SACRAMENTO
Was Senior President of the Grand
Parlor of the Native
Souk.
SACRAMENTO, May 26.â Henry Clay
Cbipman died at his home in this city this
afternoon at the age of 46. He was one of
the best known Native Sons In the order,
and had the distinction of having been the
senior past president of Sacramento Par
lor and the senior president of the Grand
Parlor. He served a term in the Legisla
ture as an Assemblyman from one of the
city districts, and was at one time a mem
ber of the City Board of Education.
By occupation Chipman was a sign
writer, and for many years his work was
regarded as of the highest type, com
manding the admiration of his fellow
craftsmen wherever exhibited. It was in |
ihWi that Chiyman engaged himself as an
apprentice with James Calvyn, a pioneer
sign writer, whose work was seen on the j
stores of Huntington, Stanford, Crocker
and other early merchants of Sacramento,
as well as upon the floating palaces which
in those red-letter days of river travel
plied between Sacramento and San Fran
cisco. Calvyn was an artist, hut the
young man who engaged himself with
him in IM>X possessed a skill and taste
which would have brought him great
fame had he been more ambitious and I
sought the higher realm of art. With ;
Chipman sign writing became an art, and
he grew to a master of it. The imprint of
Calvyn and Chipman was to be found
underneath the lettering on every bank
window and upon every costly sign in
Northern California, and for a long time
they hold a monopoly of the business, to
which Chipman in part succeeded twelve
years ago, when Calvyn died.
t'hipman was very popular with the Na
tive Sons and in the personal walks of
life. He was a natlv* of Sacramento. His
widow, the daughter of H. Weinrelch, an
old-time merchant, survives him, as do a
daughter and two sons.

that he was sick and unable to come to

WORLD'S LARGEST
GRAPEVINE DYING
Or)e of the Attractions of Santa
Barbara to Be Cut
Dowq.
BANTA BARBARA, May 26.â The big grapevine in the Montecito
will be cut down on Monday. This vine is the largest of its kind in the
world, and no tourist considers his visit to Santa Barbara complete
without having seen it. It is known the world over. The trunk is over
four feet in circumference and the trellis 75 feet square.
Albert Magee, its owner, is satisfied that the vine is dying, and so
has decided to destroy it. The vine is supposed to be from 75 to 100
years old. There is no definite record of its planting, but the cutting
was set by a Mr. Robles.
Its history is interesting. The original vine, which was taken up
after its death and carried to Philadelphia in 1876 as an exhibit at the
Centennial Exposition, was a cutting from a Mission grape. It had
been used as a riding whip by some senorita who came to visit the Robles
home either from Ventura or Carpinteria. She planted the cutting
with her own hands and it took root and grew undisturbed for years.
From the thrifty young vine the Robles family took another cut
ting and planted it near the first. The soil and other conditions were
extraordinarily favorable, and both vines grow to enormous size.
The trunk will be on exhibition at the Chamber of Commerce.
OCCUPIES RABBI
FIBBER'S PULPIT
Genti c Pastor Preaches
In a Synagogue.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, May 26.â Rev. Reuben H.
Sink, pastor of the First Congregational
Church, delivered the sermon to-night at
the regular Friday evening service in the
Jewish synagogue. The Christian minis
ter was introduced to the congregation
by Rabbi Farber in an address which
was not less significant of the trend of
liberal ideas than was the presence of
the minister in a Jewish place of wor
ship. â¢
"Judaism accepts all truth from where- !
soever it comes," said the rabbi. "Preju- i
dice and superstition must eventually go
down before the irresistible march of
enlightened thought and modern frater
nity. Since my arrival- in this city I have
endeavored not only to be a teacher to
my people, but to meet with those of all
persuasions and enter into the life of
the community. I was gratified to soon j
be able to establish pleasant and helpful
relations with the Ministerial Associa
tion of this city. We exchanged our ]>ri
vate views and often find them to be In
harmony. J have, my people, taken a new !
departure in inviting a representative of j
another congregation to speak here this
evening, and 1 esteem it an unusual pleas
ure tn present to you my friend and col
league, Rev. Mr. Sink."
"It is a pleasure for me to be here, and
I feel that I can indorse the kind senti
ments expressed by your rabbi." said Dr.
Sink. "That you indulge me here speaks
your kindly feelings more than words."
I>r. Sink said he would base his remarks
on Kxodus 111:15, wherein the Almighty de
clared himself to be the God of Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob. The speaker referred
to a visit to Egypt, and how, when he
stood at the Pyramids, it had occurred to
him that the great wonders had been
reared in the gronns of oppressed Israel,
cemented with their life's blood and
washed by their tears. He traced the
history of the Jewish people and spoke of
the distinctive features in the relations
between the three patriarchs and God. To
Abraham he was a God of youth, leading
and directing the founder of Israel when
he went into a strange land. Isaac's re
lations were those of a home builder, and
upon his marriage and life he invoked the
blessing of the Most High. To Jacob God
was a help in time of wrestling and dis
tress.
Dr. Sink said what humanity, regard
less of creed, needed was a personal fjtod.
such as was the one of the patriarchs â
a God of youth, a God of marriage, and
a God of aid in time of distress. The
common father should he set up in the
heart to the exclusion of all else. It would
make better men. better homes and a
happier people. He hoped God would be
exalted in every life, and his reign be
complete in the daily walks of every aud
itor before him.
The only direct reference to Christ was
at the close, when he spoke of the great
example of one whom he believed to be
the Incarnation of God upon earth.
The best families of the city were rep
resented in the congregation, and wide
spread attention will doubtless be at
tracted by the event. Rabbi Farber will
speak in Dr. Sinks's church on Sunday
evening.

DEADLOCK AS TO
BOUNDARY DISPUTE
No Development in the
Canada Controversy.
Specla! Dispatch to Ttu> Call.
NEW YORK. May 26.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: See
r-tary Hay said to-day there were no
new developments in regard to the ne
gotiations looking to a recall of the
Joint High Commission for a settle
ment of all pending questions between
this country and Canada.
This is taken to mean that the dead
lock over the American boundary dis
pute continues. The United States
seems firm in its refusal to separate the
boundary dispute from other pending
questions and to submit it to arbitra
tion as proposed by Great Britain.
Dispatches from Kmbassador Choate
Indicate a willingness on the part of
the British authorities to have the
whole subject come up before the Joint
High Commission again, but the For

certain portion of the concession be
made before the question of boundary
lin<- gees to arbitration.
BRITISH PAPERS PLEAD
FOR ARBITRATION
LONDON, May 27.â The morning papers
discuss the future of the Anglo-American
commission, with an apparent desire to
pacify both Canada and the United States,
though strongly disinclined to give the
colony any lack of moral support.
The Daily Chronicle says: "The whole
boundary dispute is small, but there is
much reason to fear that the lumber
Quarrel, the other cause of friction, has
produced a needlessly hostile temp, r be
iv..een Canada and Washington. Both
sides appear to be thinking of perpetual
retaliations and reprisals. Such a state
of things is full of evil. As the com
mittee affords an opportunity to give
and take, it is urged that a settlement
should be achieved. Should this fail and
should the Nicaraguan arrangements also
fail a very unpleasant reaction might en
sue. A return to any unfriendly temper
between the two branches of the Anglo-
Saxon race would be a disaster to every
one and above all to Canada herself."
The Daily Mail says: "It is obviously
unfair for the United States to expect
the British Empire to do all the giving,
and America to do all the taking. This
is a form of diplomacy to which we are
painfully accustomed in our dealings will
a certain power in the Far East. What
America seeks is an annulment of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and Canada
presses for a decision regarding the Alas

her. If arbitration can anywhere be em

ENGLISH BUTLERS
Arrest of Young Men for
Daring Theft.
Si", Iâ Dispatch to The Call.
NKW YORK, May 26.â George Hird,
32 years old, and Robert "Wright. 20
years old, two English butlers, were
arrested this morning by Brooklyn de
tectives for being concerned in the
theft of $10,000 worth of diamonds from
M rs. Thomas E. Stillman, wife of
Thomas E. Stillman of the law firm of
Stillman & Hubbard. Stillman's
daughter, Miss Mary Stillman, was
presented to the Queen at a recent
drawing room.
About the middle of March Mr. and
Mrs. and Miss Stillman went to Eu
rope, leaving their residence in charge
of the servants, among whom were the
two men who were arrested this morn-
Ing. In a safe in the Stillman house
Mrs. Stillman put about $10,000 worth
of diamonds when she went to Europe.
She and her husband returned home on
May 2, and a few days later Mrs. Still
man went to the safe to get some of the
jewelry. She found that a number of
diamonds and ather precious stones
valued at about $10,000 had been stolen.
Captain Reynolds of the Brooklyn de
tective force was notified, and he and
the detectives worked on tho rase.
Yesterday afternoon Wright went to
Mrs. Stillman and handed her a clover
leaf diamond pin, valued at $2500, which
he said he had found in the parlor.
Mrs. Stillman was delighted to get this
pin and believed Wright's story. A
little later Wright again went to Mrs.
Stillman and handed to her an unset
pearl, an unset diamond and a $o gold
piece, all of which he averred had been
found by him in the parlor.
Mrs. Stillman then remembered that
in the list of jewelry she had furnished
the police there were no pearls men
tioned. She went again to the safe and
found that more jewelry had been
taken since Wednesday. The detectives
went to the house and arrested the two
butlers.
The police announced this afternoon
that they had recovered $5000 worth of
the missing diamonds.
PUTS A CHECK ON
RIVER IMPROVEMENTS
Attorney General Ford's Opinion
Means a Serious Loss
to the State.
WOODLAND, May 28.â 1f the opinion
rendered by Attorney General* Ford in
relation to the office or Commissioner of
Public Works is upheld by the courts the
effect will be to stop any further river
improvement until there can be further
legislation. This will be a serious loss to
the interests concerned, as there still re
mains more than $180,000 in the fund ap
propriated by the State f, )r river improve
ment, and the auditing hoard and Com
missioner had much important work In
view. The work already accomplished
has been generally indorsed and com
mended. To stop the work at this time
will not only be a serious detriment to
the State, but may result in impairing
the efficiency of that already completed
Commissioner Leake says that his views
have not been correctly quoted. He has
DO doubt that the claims which have been
regularly and legally incurred can and
will be paid. Neither has he any doubt
that the auditing board is authorized to
complete all contract work now under
way. When such contracts are finished
its functions will probably cease until
there is some legislative action.
Two eminent lawyers have advised him
that he still holds the office of Commis
sioner of Public Works by virtue of an
unexpired commission issued by Gover
,nor Budd, and by reason of the invalidity
of an amendment to the law which creat
ed the office. The beneficial results that
have followed the completion of the jetty
system, the easement and the "cut-offs"
iri the San Joarjuin River are so great and
have been so generally recognized and the
necessity that river improvement should
be continued is so urgent that he deems
it a matter of justice to himself and a
duty he owes to those who are most in
terested to take such steps as shall have
the law judicially interpreted, provided
competent legal authority holds out a
reasonable hope of success.

"THE BOWERY"
LAID IN ASHES
Coney Island Property
Destroyed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK', May 26.â Coney Island
property to the value of nearly a million
dollars was destroyed by fire early this
morning-, twenty acres in the heart of the
summer resort, the district known as
"the Bowery," being reduced to ashes.
The 200 buildings burned were located
between the Bowery and the ocean, Til
yous walk on the west and the old iron
pier on the east. These buildings ranged
iti size and importance from a wabbly
bath "na*ilion" to the handsome five
story Hygel Hotel, including theaters,
concert balls, dance pavilions, stores of
various kinds, restaurants and hotels of
every grade. The fire made shelterless
for a time a native and transient popula
tion of about 3500, including 500 men and
Women classed as comedians and sou
brettes employed in the district, and si
lenced no less than 100 pianos which have
for years assisted in merrymaking at
Coney Island.
At ;> o'clock the firemen were called out
and extinguished a blaze in a cottage.
Half an hour later they were called out
for a second Ore.
Additional alarms followed in quick suc
cession until twenty engines, some from
as far away as South Brooklyn, were
called. In ten minutes after the second
fire started thÂ« whole Bowery district
was in wild alarm. The thousands im
mediately threatened rushed out attired
as they slept. They were quickly joined
by the entire native and over-night popu
lation of the island, some 10,000, whose
eager interest hampered the firemen. It
was seen that the firemen had determined
to make the Bowery the fighting line, and
then, the last hope of those south of the
Bowery that any of their houses might
be saved being gone, a pellmoll rush for
salvage or- plunder took place. Scores of
thieves broke through the fife lines and
entered the district from the ocean side,
and then the work of looting was whole
sale.
A crowd carrying off a piano was one
Bight which taught th<> police what kind
of crooks they had to deal with.
So far as known only four persons were
injured or burned and all will recover,
Deputy Battalion chief Kirkpatriek says
he is convinced that the fire is of In
cendiary origin. He arrives at this con
clusion owing to the fact that the flames
broke out in two different imrts of the
island at about the same time, both places
being difficult of ac< ess so tar as lire en
gines are concerned, and from the fact
that upon his arrival he found traces of
keiosene <>il along the board walks and
around both houses where the lire origi

OFFICERS CAN'T
ATTEND TRIALS
Ordered Not to Visit
Palace of Justice.
! Dlspatcb to The. Call.
PAKis, May 26.â The Minister r., r
War, Camille Krantz, has issued strin
gent orders that no officer, either in
civilian costume or in uniform, shall
frequent the Palace of Justice or its
precincts next week during the public
hearing of the demand for a revision
of the Dreyfus trial and during the
trial before the Court of Assizes of
Paul de Roulede and M. Marcel-Habert.
on a charge of provoking offenses
against the security of the state and in
citing the army to mutiny.
On the day of the funeral of the late
President Felix Faure of Frances Feb
ruary 23 last, as the troops led by Gen
eral Roget were returning from the
cemetery of Pere la Chaise to the bar
racks at Neuilly-Sur-Seine, Paul de
Roulede, chief of the League of Patri
ots and a violent opponent of Dreyfus
revision, called upon General Roget to
march his troops on to the Elysee Pal
ace. The request was ignored.
M. de Roulede, who was then joined
by M. Marcel-Habert, a member of the
Chamber of Deputies for Rambouilet,
another violent anti-revisionist, headed
a band of men and entered the court
yard of the barracks with the brigade.
De Roulede and Marcel-Habert boldly
proclaimed that they wished to lead the
army into a revolutionary movement
and to replace the parliamentary re
public by a plebiscitary republic. They
refused to quit the barracks and were
placed under arrest. On the following
day the facts were reported to the
Chamber of Deputies, which promptly
authorized the Public Prosecutor to
take proceedings against them on the
charge of attempting to turn the troops
from their duty.
The public hearing of the demand for
the Dreyfus revision is expected to open
on Monday next. The speeches will
probably occupy four days and the de
cision be given on June 2 or 3.

BUT SUFFER
PRIVATIONS
Cape Nome Argonauts Weary
of Their Quest of
Wealth.
RICH CLAIMS STAKED
Gold in Store for Many, but During
the Winter Fourteen Men
Have Died.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
T.ACOMA, May 26.â A letter has been
received from Charles Gould, foÂ»merly
of Seattle. Riving hitherto unpublished
details of winter life and conditions at
Cape Nome. The letter was written on
December 9, at Anvil Creek, fifty-five
miles from Cape Nome. Gould says:
It was in October when we got hero
and we were all out of provisions. We
were not the only onea in that rix, but
there has been enough to las: thr >ugh,
and as soon as we can â : t word to St.
Michael there will be plenty..
We need fuel more than anything else.
No wood of any kind grows within 200
miles of this section. Phe only thing that
grows here that can be mini d is a sort
of sage brush or juniper bush, which
burns up in a jiffy. !t is about like hay to
burn, in .act it could be cut with a scythe
if we had one. It grows from two to four
feet high.
You cannot hire any one here, as all
have claims thai are so rich they havo
got swelled heads and will not work for
others. Of those whose claims have beea
worked much this winter two men figure
that they have (80,000 In the dirt that will
be washed out as soon as it is warm
enough, and must of the others' "hums
are nearly as rich. It is only a few feet
to bedrock and it is all pay dirt. I re
cently washed out about a barrel of dirt
that netted me fully $200 in nuggets and
coarse gold, and my partner, a man
named Hicklln, from Missouri, found one
nugget that weighed li^i ounces.
So much for the gold. We will all have
! plenty, but I would not stay here another
winter for the whole shooting match.
Hardships have been terrible and fourteen
men have died. We. now have 211 here,
seven being women. Food has been
scarce and lack of variety has made al
most all of us sick at times. Improper
shelter has been the worst setback. There
are but three buildings here, the best
being a portable aluminum house, the
other two being practically cowsheds
made of lumber that composed the tem
porary deckhouse on a boat that wa3
towed" up here by rowboats.
! The tents soon cracked and went into
â  shreds from freezing and from the wind,
which is stronger than any zephyr that
ever came my way before. Those having
tents had to double up and by putting
two and three together, one inside tho
other and keeping the snow off the out
si, l.- they have managed to pull through.
but it has made things very crowded,
which, in turn, helped to keep us warm.
r '"h. aluminum house has been turned Into
a hospital and Is altogether the most
comfortable place here.
Some of the boys had to build ice huts
to live in on account of their tents catch
ing fire. Ice huts are much more com
[ortable than one -would imagine, tlin
worst part being ihe ventilation Vrm
would luufth to coÂ» tne Â«ay the boys have
made windows for the store out of glass
bottles, which is the only transparent
stuff they could get hold of. Firearms are
not needed, as there is no game here
about.
GOLD IN A STREET.
Yellow Metal Taken Out of a Marys-
ville Thoroughfare.
MARYSVILLE. May 26.â While digging
a ditch on the main street of this city to
day workmen took out blue gravel which,
when washed yielded gold in heavy flakes.
The dirt is from a gravel pit in the north
ern suburbs of the city, and it is known
that strata of gravel extend in all direc
tions from the pit. A very black sand ap
pears with the gold when the gravel is

Justice Gass' Narrow Escape.
SAN JOSK. May 26.â City Justice J. \V.
Gass had a narrow escape from serious
injury if not death at hi? residence this
morning. By reason of wounds received
in the war he is compelled to use a
â wheeled chair. He has an elevator in his
home to enable him to ascend to the sec
ond floor. The wire rope became unfas
tened this morning and the elevator fell
while the Judge was coming down to
breakfast. His chair was smashed to
splinters and he received a slight blow
on th*> head from the rope. Outside of a
shaking up no serious injury was sus
tained. A physician was called, but after
an investigation Justice Gass was able
to perform his duties in the courtroom.
Jerome B. Johnson Dead.
MARYSVILLE. May 26.â Jerome B.

TIONS AS TO DxSARMAMENT.
All Suggestions and Petitions From
Outsiders Will Be Received and
Then Pigeonholed With
out Consideration.
to The Call.
THE HAGUE, May 26.â 1t can now be I
stated with some degree of confidence
that the delegates to the Peace Con
ference are gradually arriving at the
belief that its outcome will be very
much what Andrew White, United
Embassador at Berlin and head '
of the American delegation here, fore-
I â  â¢':. correspondent of the As
ted Press in the interview cabled
t<i the Tnit. .i States last Monday.
So far as armaments aro concerned, j
the utmost that is expected to be ac
plished is some slight recommenda
tions to the Governments participating.
The various committees have now
1 to work, ami the delegates have :
begun a formal exchange of views. It:
was decided to-day to appoint commit
tees i" re.-eive all suggestions, pro-;
a and petitions emanating from
outsiders, but so far as Is yet ascer- j
talnable these will be pigeonholed with
out consideration, unless they
within the purview of the questions
enumerated in the circular of Count
Mtiravieff, the Russian Minister of For- ;
Affairs, in outlining the subjects
for consideration.
The disarmament committee met this
morning, and M. Bernaert, chief of the
Belgian delegation, who presided, set
forth the points submitted for consid
eration. The two sections immediately !
divided and proceeded to a discussion of j
of firearms and explos- '
Ives, which continued until the hour l"or
adjournment.
The arbitration committee met this
aoon under the presidency of the
chiel of the Fn in h delegation, Leon
Bourgeois, who was Hanked by the;
honorary presidents of tlu- committee.
Sir Julian Pauncefote, chief of the Brit
isfa delegation, and Count Nigra, chief
..t the Italian delegation.
M. I presented the questions
of mediation and arbitration and sug- j
d a programme the committee
might follow, urging recourse to all
pacific means to settle international
Questions before a recourse to war. He'
submitted a long list of possible sub
jects of dispute which might arise be-'
tween nations and yet might find solu- .
tlon In arbitration, closing with the
more difficult problems. He then pre
sented a Bcheme already introduced to
the full conference by a Russian d
.t scheme consisting of forty ar
tides.
Th< nf of M. Bourgeois was
clear ami concise, commanding the
-t attention.
Sir Julian f&uucefote proposed that,
the committee should immediately
all else, to consider the
rmanent tribunal of ar
bitration. He did not, however, sub
mit any plan and eventually withdrew
his motion in view of the suggestions
. by Count Nigra and others, who
I the wisdom of following the pro
tne of the ], resident, in which
the question of a permanent tribunal
s the general subject of arbitra
tion.
M. Bourgeois observed that the com
mittee, by not opposing it, gave adhe
â¢â > the principle favoring a peace
ful polution of international questions
before a recourse to arms.
Recognizing that the committee was â 
too large to consider the Russian pro
posals, M. Bourgeois appointed the fol
lowing sub-committee: Chevalier Des
camps-David, of the Belgian delega
tion; Professor Asser, privy councillor
of The Netherlands delegation; Baron
Estournelles de Constant of the French
delegation; Frederick Holls, secretary
of the United States delegation; M.
I.ammasch of the Austro-Hunirarian ;
-ation; Professor Maartens of the
Russian delegation.; M. F. Odier of the
Swiss delegation, and Dr. Zorn of the
University of Konigsberg, representing;
the German delegation.
Sir Julian Pauncefote and fount
Nigra were appointed honorary presi
dents of the sub-committee and M.
Bourgeois and M. Destal were em- ]
powered to attend its meetings.
This arrangement gives representa
tion to all the great powers as well as
to Holland, Belgium and Switzerland.
Chevalier Deacamps-David was ap
pointed chairman of the sub-commit

WORLD'S RECORD BROKEN.
Pennsylvania University Athlete's
New Broad Jump Mark.
NEW VoliK, May W.â Tho twenty
fourth annual athletic meeting under the
auspices of the Intercollegiate Amateur
Athletic Association to determine the in
tercollegiate championship at field and
track events began this afternoon on
Manhattan Held, where it will be conclud
ed to-morrow, the trials having taken up
the time to-day.
One world's record was smashed. This
was on the running broad jump, and A.
C. Kxaentlein of Pennsylvania, who had
acquitted himself cleverly earlier In tho
afternoon by winning his high and low
hurdle trials, was the <>ne who did the
trick. On bis lir.st jump the Pennsylva
nlan covered 23 feet 10^2 Inches, but
â¢ clipsed his own world"s record of 24 feet
3% Inohea on his second attempt, covering
114 feet 4V-2 inches. There was some doubt
;is t<i whether his jump was a world's rec
ord, but "Father Bill" Curtis dispelled
this by asserting that Xewburn's jump nf
2\ feet d\ inches, ma<l>- at Mullingar, Ire
land, was not accepted by the. Irish or
English associations.
Pennsylvania has certainly the best
chance for the honors, and except some
thing happens to disable, her representa
tives the intercollegiate trophy will re
main In the University of Pennsylvania
for another year. Representatives of
Pennsylvania, Princeton, Harvard. Yale,
Columbia. Cornell, Syracuse and George
town are competing-
McOovern the Winner.
NEW YORK. May 26.â Terry McGovern

COVERACK, Cornwall, May 26. â A supreme effort to float the American
line steamer Paris commenced at 5:10 p. m. to-day. Smoke was then
belching from all her funnels and the tugs assisting her churned the
water into foam. The noise of the straining engines was audible
afar. A fresh east southeast breeze was blowing and the sea was ris
ing, as the attempt was made to refloat the steamer. When the tugs and
engines of the Paris were going at full speed the Paris appeared to be
swaying a trifle, but the leakage in the steamer's engine room was increas
ing.
The wind has veered to the eastward to-night. There is a heavy sea
and the Paris is rolling heavily.

SOME LARGE BETS
ON THE BIG FIGHT
Fitzsimmons a Warm Favorite, but
There Is No Lack of
Jeffries Money.
NEW YORK, Maj 26.â Fitzsimmons is!
a big favorite for the coming flght with j
Jeffries. A good deal of Jeffries money
was in evidence at Dave Hollands to
day. Two wagers of $300 to $450 were
on the Californian. Larry Ryan, a
hot Fitzsimmons enthusiast, laid $100 to
$75 on the champion twice. T. J. Ryan,
the bookmaker, has $2000 to back the
Cornishman. Jerry Fitzpatrick to-day
found a taker for $200. Alf King, mana-
Solly Smith, found a customer for
m ;' his money. Zeke Butler agreed to
lay $1000 against this sum. These are the
largest Odds given against Jeffries since
the flght was Hrsl broached
"Skeets" Martin, the jockey, says he
has $1000 which he wishes to stake againsi
$2 Â«i that Jeffries will win. Peter Daily.
the actor, has placed $1000 to $500 on Fitz
simmons. Joe Little Of Oceanic. N. J..
where Jeffries trained last year to me. ,
Bob Armstrong, was in town with a targe !
wad of greenbacks to hazard on the < alt
fornian at l to 2. "Hilly" Curran, another
Jeffries supporter, has $586 to back the
boiler maker at the prevailing odds.
\s the general impression around town
was that "the battle would be for twenty
rounds the announcement that the limit
of the' encounter had been Increased to
twenty-five rounds naturally caused a
good deal of comment. In consequence m
the change many wagers were made, stip
ulating the number of rounds in wntch
either pugilist would do the trick. 1-ltz
Â«immons has the call in this respect, and
a number of bets at even money were
recorded to-day that he would stop the
brawny boiler-maker in about thirty min
utes.

FOLSOM LINED
WITH WEAPONS
Startling Discovery of
Warden Aull.
; Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, May 26.â Prison- Di
rector James H. 'Wilkins has succeeded in
giving Folsom Penitentiary one of the
most wholesome upheavals in its history,
and incidentally a very disagreeable sur
prise to Warden Aull. The Warden used
to think Folsom remarkably free from
weapons, on account of the limited op
portunity the convicts there have to
manufacture such articles as compared
with San Quentin prison, but he lias
changed his mind.
On account of tho cowardly attack on
Guard Janus McDonald by Jacob Oppen
hetmer and the murder of Showers by
Putt man, both crimes occurring with
only a few hours' difference of time, the
Board of State Prison Directors con
cluded at their late meeting at Folsom
that a drastic method was necessary to
prevent the repetition" of such terrible
events. Accordingly Director Wilkins
drew up a resolution, adopted by. the
board, which provided that any prisoner
caught in future with a deadly weapon in
bis possession should be placed in soli
tary confinement and kept there for the'
remainder of his term, without regard to
its length. \
In' the case of "Toughy" Wilson, also
known as "Shy Red." a convict who had
been punished seventeen times for in
fractions of prison discipline, the law was
made ex post facto. Wilson was brought
before -the board for trying to Stab a
man, the attempt failing on account- of
the assailant stumbling as he â  made- the
thrust, He was exceedingly. defiant and
said he would arm himselr as often as he
'pleased. -- â¢ * -
"Well," said President Fitzgerald, "we
have made a new rule; under which you
will have to serve the remainder of your
term of thirty-six years in solitary con
finement." _ '.-â .-.
"What? Thirty-six years in solitary
confinement!" yelled the now thoroughly
frightened man. He was tokl it meant
that, and was so overcome that he had to
be supported to his cell. The news was
soon disseminated anmng the convicts
and caused a commotion.
Last Wednesday Warden Aull Bet all
the guards available at work to search
the penitentiary and the result nearly
gave him an attack of heart failurJ.
Knives, brass knuckles, "billies," skele
ton keys, "jimmies." and bludgeons wore
found all over the prison. They were dis
covered on convicts, in cells, in the work
shops, around the grounds and in various
Bafe places throughout the different build
ings, the small arsenal piled before War
den Aull at the close making his eyes di
late in wonder.
"Holy smoke:" he exclaimed, "I never
dreamed there were so many weapons in
the prison from the time it was built un
til wp made this search."
What caused the greatest wonder was
the discovery of a murderous dirk knife
of prison manufacture on the "trusty"
who assists Clerk Urainerd S. Smith.
Aull was not nearly so surprised as was
Smith when this discovery was made,
because the "trusty" was thought to be
one of the most reliable convicts at Fol
som.
The prisoners were then all lined up and
addressed by the Warden. He told them
of the new rule and the intention to en
force it, without regard to consequences.
The convicts w.re informed that as the
prison had just been cleared of weapons
th.y had a clear record With which to
start and had better take Lhfl warning.
A pin could have been heard to drop
while Aull was speaking, and it is safe to
say that weapons at Folsom will here
after be manufactured on the retail plan.
Alameda's Tax Money Refused.
SACRAMENTO, May 26.â A tender was
made to State Controller Colgan to-day
of the taxes of Alameda County due the
State, but the Controller declined to ac
cept the tender pending the settlement of
the conUntion relative to the commis
sions of Assessor Dalton for the collec
tion of poll taxes. The amount tendered
was according to Assessor Dalton's cal
culations.
S. M. HUGHES IS NOW
GOVERNMENT ANALYST
UN'i'l.K SAM has created a new
office in the customs department
fn this city, and S. M. Hughes,
Ph. G., the well-known druggist,
has been selected as the first man to
administer it. The position is that of
special analyst for everything except
wines, teas and coffees.
Mr. Hughes' duties are quite numer
ous and arduous. They call for the
chemical analysis of, ores, oils, chem
icals, silks and every import of which
it is necessary for the Government to
know the constituents. Probably the
most important part of Mr. Hughes'
work will be that of polarizing Import
ed sugars to determine their sacchar
ine strength. Another responsible re
quirement of the office, which means
much to the canners of the State, i 3
that of determining the amount of
sugar contained in canned fruits ex
ported from this port, for which the
Government allows the shipper a
drawback.
The now official is a graduate of the
University of California, and has fol
lowed the profession of druggist and
chemist for the last twenty-five years
in this city. By reason of his well
known abilities it goes without say
ing that the exacting duties of the po
sition will be well performed. Mr.
Hughes is now receiving the congratu
lations of his many friends.

when it is known that two hundred rabid
supporters of the Sand Crabs are coming
up from the city by the sea to shout and
root for their pet aggregation of home
talent. Manager Tuttle of Santa Cruz has ;
chartered a special train to convey his
young men and their ardent supporters to
this city and they will arrive this morn- |
ing The fans of Santa Cruz have not
recovered from their indignation aroused
two weeks ago. when their team was
given a walloping on the home diamond. j
They have been laboring under the delu- |
sion that Manager Harris, the. umpire and
Captain Tip (/Neil entered into a con
spiracy to rob them of the game, and they ;
are coming all the way to San Francisco
to get satisfaction. A series of three
games will be played, one of which will
take Place in Oakland Sunday morning, ,
and the visitors will use three pitchers,
commencing with Daubenbis and winding
up on Sunday afternoon with Do nil n. the
kingpin twlrler of the league The Friscos
will depend largely on "Fireman Fitz,
who will do the Pitching this afternoon
and to-morrow afternoon. The only time
he has been batted hard this season was
in the game against Santa Cruz, and he
is cage? for. an opportunity to convince
the Sand Crabs that they are not .the hot
test batters in the game. John P. CahiU,

Buffers for Sins of Others.
J. M. Rademaker. proprietor or" the
Metropole saloon, 733 Market street, is be
ing made to suffer through the sins of
others. Among the arrests for conduct
ing percentage poker games recently was
one Hanson, whose place of business ad
joined the Metropole. In the publication
of the arrest Hanson was referred to as
the proprietor of the "Metropole," where
as his place was known as the "Market
Street Social Club." The same mistake
was made upon Hanson's conviction in
the. Police Court. As a result of these
errors Mr. Rademaker says his business
has been practically ruined. He had
agreed to sell the place to the Golden
Eagle Distilling Company and the papers
were being prepared, but in consequence
of his saloon being confounded with the
poker rooms the deal was declared, off,
and many of his former customers are
now afraid to be seen entering the place.
He asserts that there has not been a
game of cards played in the Metropole in
three months.

Offenses.
Oliver Fairfield, a newspaper <- ;) rripr,
â¢whose route lies in the Mission district, is
what the police term a "Tartar." When
"Ollie's" stomach is filled with wine he "v.
develops exceedingly destructiv< tenden- /
cies, especially true as regards the local
telephone system, and gratifies his desire
to the great discomfort of the blue-coated
stalwarts. After imbibing rai
yesterday Fairlnld blazed his
through several places, and five ;
proved their authority to arrest hit i
ment of the evening only by thi
their brows.
About dusk Fairti'M entered tl
and saloon of A. Speckter at Twi
fifth and Mission streets and proceeded to
smash everything in sight. The police
were notified, but when an officer arrived
the bird had flown to Schubert's saloon
at Sixteenth and Mission streets, where
the performance was repeated. "Ollie" then
went to Mayers' oyster cafe, and. after
breaking a telephone to pieces because
"central" did not answer soon enough to
suit him he started in to demolish the
store.
He was engaged in this work on., the
wholesale plan when two persons un
known banged him on the head with
clubs, inflicting some severe bruises and
a bad cut over the right eye. Officers
Graham, Connell, Fitzgerald, Dalton and
Farrell arrived on the. scene just-as Fa4r
field was recuperating -and look the- ini- .

After a terrific struggle, in which the
establishment' was nearly wrecked, the
man was trussed hand and -foot and Car
ried almost to the Seventeenth-street Sta
tion. Once he got his feet loose and
kicked two of the officers hard enough
for them to remember the occasion for
a long time. Almost arrived at the sta
tion Fairfield broke loose and fled. He
was recaptured and brought back after*
another hard struggle in the street. It
took about ten policemen to put the frac

Charges of disturbing the peace and ma
licious mischief were placed against Fair
field's name. He is said to be a decent
sort of a fellow when sober, but has made
the police trouble on various occasions
while intoxicated- His reputation was so
well known that' the one officer sent at

person with whom he had to deal, sent
for more until the full complement of

THE FRANCHISE GRAB
Residents See No Good in De
mands of Railway.
Iroquois Braves Adopt Condemnatory
Resolutions Which Are Presented
by E. P. E. Troy.
THE residents of Richmond District
are up In arms against the officials
of the Market-street Railway Com
pany in their efforts to make a
grand clean-up of franchises before
the new charter goes into effect on the
first day of next January.
A meeting of the executive committee of
Richmond District Improvement As
pecially railed for the pur
onsiderlng the application of the
V irket-street Railway Company for fran
yf Ises in the Richmond District, was h. ...
j* . st night at Eighth avenue and Clement
Mreot. Many members of the club at
tended.
The unanimous opinion was expressed
that the purpose of the Market-street
company is to destroy the Sutro railroad,
the only competing line In Richmond, to
the end that It may monopolize the Btreet
car traffic of that section of the city.
Resolutions were :k l. >j . t â¢â < J calling the at
tention of the Board of Supervisors to the
fact that the Geary-street Railway fran
chise will soon expire and under the pro
visions of the new charter the city may
truct and own Its first municipal
street railway on Geary street from the
ferries to the <"liff House.
The following committee was appoint
ed t'i represent Richmond District at the*
next meeting of the Board of Supervis
ors and t'> present its objections to the
granting 1 t a franchise on Geary street
ami other parts of ttichmond District: C.
Il.Hubba (chairman). Charles Mueller, F.
TV Curtoni, Mr. Vlleges and E. P. E.
Troy.
Resolutions were also adopted approv
ing of the action of the minority of the
! ', of Supervisors and particularly
commending the vigorous opposition of
rvisor Lewis F. Byington to the at
â  â¢ .! franchise ati ..is.
The people who live under the shadow
one Mountain are suspicious of the
intentions .if the great street railway
: elieving no good can come from
present desire to attain privileges.
They see behind the application for fran
- In Richmond a possibility that the
road, which developed the district
!h;-.n any other factor, will be crip-
Its value ultimately destroyed
through the shutting off of its access to
â¢rt of the city.
The chief concern of the Rlchmondites
Is over the franchise on California street,

CITY SUFFERS
Losses Through New
Patrol System.
The supporters of the new system of po
lice activity to prevent gambling in the
dens of the Mongolian district are legion,
but for reasons heretofore explained in
The Call the larg-est percentage of
supporters is composed of the Chinese
gamblers themselves. Although the pres
ent head of the Chinatown squad. Ser
geant Donovan, fails to strike terror to
the hearts of the almond-eyed gamblers,
as did the "white devil," Sergeant Price,
he cannot be blamed for so gaining the
support of these game-keepers and pa
trons.
The truth Is that Donovan's moves to
euppress the lawless element are Or:
by a board of strategy. Each night he
must report for instructions, and with
i ach instruction goes on his way the less
capable of coping with the situation as he
find it, for he must obey instructions.
The lunacy of the present syst< tn of pe
riodical visits to the various games of the
district has already been exploited by The
Call, but the disastrous financial result,
as far as the collection of fliie.s is con
cerned, has not before been ailuded to. if
the small figures representing the amount
of fines paid into the treasury- since the
inauguration of the new system denoted
a decrease in gambling there would lie
cause for universal rejoicing, but when it
Is manifest that sufficient evidence exists
rove that gambling never flourished
as at present and with so little Interfer

sons profess to see in the application a
possibility of the Sutter-street Company
ending its relations with the Sutro line.
It is pointed out that Robert Morrow and
Mr. Grant, who control the Gutter-street
line, are also the minority stockholders
in the Geary-street road. If the fran
chise Is t.i be abandoned it is held that
their con sen must be obtained before it
can be surrendered." It is expected they
will naturally demand some concession
, for the Sutter-street line. It is reasona
ble to believe the concession would be
joint ownership of the proposed electric
road to the beach. Should that be brought'
about, eventually they would hardly con.
; tinue transferring to the Sutro line. This
I would leave the Sutro line without a con
necting link with the heart of the city.
It would undoubtedly destroy it. leaving
Clement street without a road. This Is
the business street of Richmond, and was
built up by the Sutro Company.
No franchise is asked for Point Lobos
avenue, which is taken as an intimation
that the Market-street Railway Company
expects to hold that great thoroughfare
on an old franchise. On June 3, L 892, .1
franchise was granted the Ocean Beach
Railroad Company, since merged with
the Market-street Railway Company,
from First avenue to the Cliff House
road. This was to run fifty years. No
work has been done on it, hence the claim
is made that the company has no legal

The Iroquois Club has also taken a

the following resolution, presented by K.

Whereas, The Market Street Railway

the Hoard of Supervisors for numerous

Whereas. This corporation has always ex

another smoking. A cursory glance
around would satisfy the squad, it would
leave and instantly in*- games would
open.
This system is still continued. As said
before, it was Inaugurated on April 21. In
cluding that day and tip to and includ
ing May 19, Sergeant Donovan and posse
made seventy-seven arrests. Out of this
batch lines were collected amounting to
(765. Of the seventy-seven gamblers ar- i
rested twenty-five were dismissd and
seven cases arÂ»- still pending. The preced
ing month, from and including March
2\ and up to and including the 18th of
April. Sergeant Price, under the old
system, which was "Investigated" ami
found wanting, made 224 arrests. Pines
were collected from tins.- gamblers
amounting to $2600, forty-flve cases were
dismissed and a few are still pending. In
other words a comparison will show that
under the old system 347 more arrests
were made, tin- city was enriched Sis:',;,
and less gambling was indulged in. The .
19th and 2oth of Aprilâ these dates, as
will be seen, being omitted In the calcu
lationsâwere occupied by Sergeants Prlc â 
and Donovan in consultations. Price was
preparing to turn the district over and
Donovan to receive it, consequently no
am-sts were made.
It will be seen from these figures that
under the new system the city will lose
about $2000 a month, $24,000 a year, and
still the "merry-go-round" continues, and
Chinese continue likewise.
To properly handle the Chinese district
it is evident that experience is required.
During the last two raids made under the
supervision of Lieutenant X.sola seventy
arrests were made, but each and every
case was dismissed.
Insufficient evidence to convict was
taken by the police on these occasions,
but on the long list captured by Price but
forty-live escaped, and the rest donated
to the city treasury for their wrongs.
Doubtless the old system was the best
systemâ the Board of Strategy notwith

The Marine Underwriters Reward
Captain Whitneyâ Captain Pierce
Will Not Be the Master
of the Grant.
There were two collisions on the water
front yesterday. The schooner Harvest
Queen drifted down on the tug Relief and
was nearly sunk, while :he schooner
Ahhie ran into the river steamer City of
Stockton and tore away nearly all her
pert quarter.
The fact that the wind was light and
there was a very strong flood tide ac
counted for both collisions. The Harvest
Queen was bringing a load of shingles
from North Beach, when she got caught
in the tide rip off Mission-street wharf.
H carried her along at a good rate of
speed, and the captain congratulated him-
THEY MET AND THEY PARTED.
THE crew of the schooner Mary Dodge was given a very pleasant surprise at sea on May 22. It was a
beautiful night and right ahead the lookout on the schooner could make out a British bark. The
Dodge rapidly overhauled the larger vessel and then Captain Hansen made her out to be the Moel
Eilian, frrm Pisagua fo~ San Francisco, with nitrate. The Mary Dcdge was on her way here from
Honolulu. As the latter came up all on board heard from the forecastle head of the Britisher the strains
of the "Star-Spangled Banner." This was followed by "Yankee Doodle," "Dixie," "Maryland, '"'Marching
Through Georgia" and other American melodies. The crew of the Moel Eilian is a musical one and it has
a band of its own, composed of a comet, flute, accoidion, tin whistle and two drums. Captain Hansen says
that in all his life he never heard such perfect music as that which floated over the moonlit waters from
the Moel Eilian.
self on the time he was making. Sud- I
â¢ l.iily the wind dropped light and the
Harvest Queen lost steerage way. Be
fore the anchor could be dropped the tide
had carried her across the bow <>f the \
Relief. lying at Folsom-street wharf. -and
the Harvest Queen was cut down to the
water's' edge. Nearly all her cargo had
to li.- lettisoned to keep her from Sinking
and then the tug Amelia took her to the j
Mission mud flats.
'l'h' Ahl>i> was on her way out to Cas- ,
par and the City of Stockton had stopped
t.> allow her v> pass. The wind and tide
again took command and the Abl>ie
sheered into the steamer, carrying away
over twenty-five feet of the steamer's
port quarter.
Captain Pierce is not going out in the i
transport Grant after all. He gave up'
the command of the Centennial in order
to be captain of the big steamer, but the ,
powers that be at Washington havo
changed all that, and a .man is now on :
his way out from the Kast to take com
mand of the transport. It seems to be ',
a case of "very hard lines," but the
chances are that Uncle Sam will take care
of Captain Pierce on some other vessH.
The Grant .will get away next Monday
with about 1500 troops aboard.
The Sheridan came off the drydock yes
terday and will !><â  coaled in the stream.
Bhe will then go back to her berth at the
Government wharf to load for Manila.
The marine underwriters remembered
Captain Whitney of the Klihu Thomson
yesterday. For bringing the steamer
safely into port after she had lost her
propeller they presented him with a gold
watch and chain, a diamond locket and a
check for |600. 'liny also gave him a
check for $250 to divide among the men
who assisted him. On the inside case of
the watch was engraved: "From marine
underwriters on S. S. Klihu Thomson, to
Captain J?. B. Whitney, in recognition or
meritorious services. San Francisco, May,
l>s;Â»9 " The presentation was made by J.
J? I-evison of the Fireman's Fund, and
Captain Whitney responded in a neat
little speech.
In August, 189 S. the board passed a reso
lution to the effect that no employe should
hypothecate his salary on pain of dis
missal This rule has been more honored
in the breacji than in the observance, but
now the Commissioners have issued a
new edict, and the next time a money
lender presents an order the employe who
gave it willbe dismissed.
Captain Lew Williams will take the
bark Alaska out to-day. She is bound for
the gold lields and Captain Cogan was to

THE WHEELS OF
JUSTICE CEASE
THEIR GRIND
No Money to Maintain
Jurors.
JUDGE COOK CALLS A HALT
CRIMINAL DEPARTMENTS HAVE
CLOSED THEIR DOORS.
Â«
The Board of Supervisors Will Take
Steps on Monday to Provide
Such Funds as Are
Necessary.
The public larder is empty and the
wheels of justice have stopped their
grind. Yesterday morning Judge Cook
announced that the criminal departments
of the Superior Court would try no more
cases until provision had been made to
feed the jurors sitting- to determine the
guilt or innocence of accused persons
brought before the bar. This decision
was reached after due deliberation on the
part of the Judges of this branch of th.}
court â Cook, Lawler and Dunne â and they
intend to adhere rigidly to their decision.
All prisoners in custody are entitled to
trial within sixty days after their incar-
eeration, and in event the matter of cre
ating a fund to supply the jurors with
food is not arranged by the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors with
in that time the doors of the city jails
will be thrown open and a dangerous
host of criminals will stalk forth to re
new t heir chosen vocations.
A short time ago it was announced that
the fun,d created to pay restaurant bills
incurred on behalf of the jurors was ex
hausted. Thursday at noon the* jury in
whose hands the fate of John J. llierer,
charged with manslaughter, rested was
ordered into the custody of the Sheriff,
and a deputy was directed to take them
to lunch. The twelve men good and true
were marched to a near by restaurant,
but the keeper refused to feed them with
out money in advance, saying that he
could not trust the city for the outlay.
The jurors were returned to court, and
when Judge Cook's attention was called
to the matter he disbanded the jury and
ordered its various members to return
yesterday morning to deliberate upon a
verdict. At noon yesterday the jury
came into "court and asked for further
time, and then the court instructed them
that they could not l.c fed. The Jury re
turned to the deliberation room and for a
couple of hours these hungry men dis
cussed the evidence in favor of and
against the accused. Finally they came
into court and entered a verdict of not
guilty. The court then dismissed the jury
and went into consultation, with Judges
Lawlor and Dunne. The Judges hold that
juries are entitled to maintenance and
care by the Sheriff during the time they
are in custody, and if maintenance can
not be assured them the Judges will re
fuse to call them into court. Ofttimes,
they say. juries require as many as twen
ty-four hours in which to arrive at a ver
dict, and to prevent a miscarriage of jus
tice they should be properly cared for
during that time and will be, else the
criminal department will close up and the
jails will be emptied.
Later in the day Attorney Peixotto, rep
resenting Sheriff Martin, appeared before
the Finance committee of the Board of
Supervisors and after stating the action
taken by Judge Cook asked that some
steps be at once taken to provide money
for the maintenance of jurors.. In reply
Chairman Perrault stated that the mem
bers of the committee would hold a con
ference with the Auditor and Treasurer
to-day and decide as to how best to meet
the {"mergency. The committee will re
port to the board on Monday, and that
body will no doubt pass whatever author
ization may be necessary In the prem
ises. The action contemplated is the
transfer of money from one fund to an
other.

BUCKLEY WANTS
HIS OLD POWER
BACK AGAIN
Forming Clubs in All
the Districts.
HE IS WORKING VERY QUIETLY
RUMORS CONNECTING HIM WITH
VARIOUS FACTIONS.
The Blanket Ticket Idea Has Not Yet
Been Dropped by the Com
mittee of One Hun
dred.
The blind boss is the coming thorn in
the side of the local Democracy. He is
organizing and all the friends of the Com
mittee of One Hundred can say will not
keep the rank and file of the party out ;
of the secret. He is particularly strong
in the Twenty-ninth, and there are others
of the downtown districts where he is
strong enough to shQw himself in the
open, but there is not a district in the
city that he has not canvassed and in
which he has not men working. Ih some
he has small clubs; in others he has large
clubs, but in all he has some kind of a
footing and he is reaching for more.
There have been all kinds of rumors
regarding the workings Of the Bucktey
f action, many of them, it Is believed, hav
ling been set going by himself. He is
said to have been affiliated with every
wing of the party, respectable and other
wise, since he returned to search for his
former power. He h;is been credited to
the Committee of One Hundred more than
once, but most persistently is he con
nected with the prospects of Phelan. It
is believed that much of the talk con
necting him with Phelan is an outgrowth
of his own desires, but so far there have
been no denials.
Coupled with the rumor of Buckley and
j his Phelan flirtation is the well defined
] idea that if Mr. Phelan wishes to win
[ in his coming campaign he must come
j down to "practical" politics. The Com
mittee of One Hundred is about of the
: same mind concerning itself, but its prac
tical politics is of a nature peculiarly
its own. There is a minority in the com
mittee which has heard the Buckley ru
mors, and these men are asking that be
fore Mr, Phelan becomes their candidate
I he be requested to declare himself free
and loose from all sid.' Issues and petty
i bosses. If he does this he will lose his
1 chance of doing "practical" politics. If
he does not do so, it will probably cause
ail kinds of a row in the committee anil
the little bosses will profli anyway.
Kainey is doing very little so far, but he
has condescended to bury the hatchet In
the Twenty-ninth and join hands with his
! old-time enemy, Buckley. The Twt-nty
, ninth is Braunhart's district. He has al
ways considered himself sole proprietor,
! and when the idea of forming a club was
| broached to him he took it under advise
i ment and allowed the formation of the
j club to drag along listlessly. But now
I he has become most active. Both Buckley
! and Kainey have well organized clubs
; right in his own stronghold, and Braun
. hart is now out with another club of his
j own make into which he hopes to gather
; what he considers the temporarily falth
i less. The worst of it is the two foreign
| clubs seem to be on the best of terms
; with each other; it is practically a join
ing of forces.
The blanket ticket idea of the Commit
-1 tee of One Hundred has not been dropped.
It is still simmering, and if there is the
slightest chance of It going through it
will be the form of ballot submitted to
. the faithful at the next primary. The
i State Central Committee has advised
i that the precincts be given representa
, tion. and it was decided that such a plan
might be a good one. The idea was taken
| as a suggestion only, however, for it was
i pointed out that the State Central Com
i mittee had no jÃwer to do more than ad
! vise the Committee of One Hundred; and
j even if it had, did not the Committee of
One Hundred control the State Central
Committee anywayâ so what was the dlf-
I ferÂ»>nce?
The outgrowth of all this has been the
quiet formulation of a plan of representa*
tion that, while seeming to have sub-
I stance, is really nothing but a shadow
i and a hollow one at that, if such a thing
I exist in the economy of nature. The idea
â to give a representation of sufficient size
to allow of a man from each precincet
I and then to so allot the entire number
I that only the districts solid for the com
! mittee will furnish the men, is one too
attractive and too "practical" for the
committee to let go without a tremor,
and it wUJ keep bobbing up. No one will
be surprised if it should be thrust for
', ward "with the announcement that all
j representatives will be chosen "at large. 1 '

Will Not Audit.
TIME FOR THE WIND-UP

Gage Threatens to Kick Against
the Board of Health Programme
Which Burns Has Pre
pared.
The executive committee of the Repub
lican State Central Committee had very
nearly reached the order of "unfinished
business" when the contest for United
States Senator called some of the mem
bers to Sacramento. The incidents and
events of the Senatorial campaign em
bracing the part which the Republican
"organization" played in the contest are
still so fresh in the minds of the people
that it is hardly necessary to recount the
failures of the session.
The "unfinished business" of the exec
utive committee must be adjusted some
time, and many leading Republicans
fancy that Major Frank McLaughlin
could not do a better thing than call the
members together at once for a final set
tlement of affairs. In the language of
the prize ring fraternity, it is time for the
"wind-up."
The aspect of affairs is not delightful, j
The statement is made by one member of j
the committee that there is no money in !
I the treasury, and yet there are many un- i
: paid accounts. The fact is known that the
Republicans were generous contributors to
theeampaignfund for the election of Henry
1. Gage and his associates. Among the'
: liberal contributors were "sound money" !
I Democrats, who were firmly convinced â ]
j thai the welfare of the State demanded I
the success of the Republican party.
There is a record in the committee's
possession of many cash contributions.
; This record, together with the memoranda
: t,t what might be called cash donations
out of the regular order, ought to show
the aggregate amount of coin received.
The vouchers on hand should show the
disbursements and the amount of the un
j paid claims can be easily ascertained. It
i will be an easy matter, therefore, to de- i
lermine the amount of money required to â 
liquidate all outstanding obligations.
The auditing committee consists of j
Judge Nusbaumer, Phil Lilienthal, Judge .
Hart, Wendell Easton and Paris Kilburn.
The last named is treasurer, but cannot
pay bills unless thf same be audited.
: Several members of the auditing com
â¢ mittee assert that they will never audit :
! bills for certain services at Sacramento. I
' They take the position that the engage- !
! ment of rooms at the Golden Eagle Hotel i
was unauthorized so far as the executive \
committee was concerned and therefore j
cannot be charged to the account of the 'â 
j organization. There is no certainty but j
i only a surmise that the party will be |
' asked to pay certain bills con-tracted at I
Sacramento. An effort was made last |

will put in claims for money expended at
; Sacramento. I am sure that the auditing

claims. There is llkeW to be a lively time
; when the executive committee meets, and
i the meeting must take place sooner or
later. We might as well settle the matter
'â  now as defer the question. 1 know that
, several Republicans will speak their
minds when the committee gets together
to discuss the subject. Th<e power to call
a meeting of the committee rests with
Major Mclaughlin." .
Governor Gage, D. M. Burns. Major Jic-
Laughlin and Phil Crimmins cannot agree
as to Board of Health appointments. So
; far Burns has had things pretty much his
i own way in the distribution of patronage,
: but the report comes that Gage is inclined
to kick against Burns" Board of Health

Governor concerning the limited range of
Burns' Influence in local aff rs.
The Governor has arranged to attend

City Attorney Declares That Seats in
the Stock Board Are Not
Taxable.
The following opinion relating to mat
ters of taxation will be welcome news to
holders of seats in the San Francico Stock
and Bond Exchange:
SAN FRANCISCO. May 26, 1599. j
Washington Dodge, Assessor City and County
- D ear sir; in your communication of the 24th
inst you Inquire If the members of the San
Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange should be
assessed for their seats or the right of mem
bership held by them in such exchange. The
constitution of this State defines property, sub
ject to taxation (Article XIII. Sec. 1) as
â¢â¢moneys debits, bonds, stocks, dues, fran
chises and all other matters and things real,
personal and mixed, capable of private owner
" Does a seat In such an exchange or board fall
â¢within any of the terms used in the constltu-
In ' the cases of Lowenberg vs. Greenbaum
(99 Cal., 162) the court defined a seat upon the
San Francisco Stock and Exchange Board as
being merely "a personal privilege of being
and remaining a member of a voluntary asso
ciation with the assent of the associates." And
in the case of San Francisco vs. Anderson (103
Cal., 70) the court held such a '."seat" to be
too impalpable to go Into any category of tax
able property. "It Is a mere right to belong to
a certain association with the latter' consent,
and to enjoy certain Deri tea] privileges and
advantages which flow from membership of
6iich association. Those privileges and advan
tages cannot be transferred without the con
sent of the association, and a forced sale of
them would not give to the purchaser the right
to occupy said seat."
It has 'also been held that a seat on the San
Francisco Produce Exchange Is not taxable
property (San Francisco vs. Wangenheim, 37
Pac. Ren. 221).
Assuming that the San Francisco Stock and
Bond Exchange js. similar in organization to
the San Francisco Stock and Exchange Board
and the San Francisco Produce Exchange, I
advise that seats upon such exchange are not
subject to taxation. Respectfully.

FROM SMALLPOX
Alarm at the Harbor
Hospital.
A VOLUNTEta HAD MEASLES
SUCCUMBED TO THE DISEASE AT
COUNTY HOSPITAL.
Owing to Suspicions of Contagious
Disease Ail Persons Brought in.
Contact With Him Are
Vaccinated.
The death of James W. Gustin at the
City and County Hospital on Thursday
has created a scare among all the people
with Whom he was brought in contact.
Malignant measles was the cause of
death, but the report gained currency
that he was suffering from smallpox.
"When the Sixth Infantry arrived from
the East last Monday it was accom
panied by W. Gustin. He wore the uni
form of Uncle Sam's men and said he
belonged to the Sixth, but was not at
tached to any company. At the Govern
ment wharf he was taken ill and was re
moved to the Harbor Hogpital. Dr. Hop
per made a cursory examination, and
rinding the man to be seriously ill at once
notified the medical authorities at the
Presidio. After some delay an army doc
tor arrived. After questioning Gustin, he
found he was a discharged volunteer and
did not belong to the regular army. He
therefore declined to have anything' to
do with the man.
In the meantime Gustin was suffering:
a great deal, and as he had all the symp
toms of typhoid fever the City and Coun
ty Hospital officials were notified and he
was moved there. He was placed in a
ward, but owing to the serious condition
of the man he was moved to a room In
which there were other men afflicted with
measles. These men were under the care
of Dr. William W. Kerr, one of the visit
ing physicians. At his suggestion Gustin
was isolated in order to allay the fears
of other patients, who had an impression
he was suffering from smallpox.
The man died on Thursday. Dr. G. E.
Sussdorff, superintendent physician of the
hospital, together with Dr. Reilly of
Cooper College, and Dr. Jules Franken
hHm of Tnland College pronounced it a
case of malignant measles, with suspected
intercurrent measles. No autopsy was
held, it being considered unnecessary. As
there had been a question as to the pres
ence (>f smallpox, Dr. Sussdorff ordered
the body placed in a sealed casket.
As an additional precaution, all persons
exposed to the supposed contagion were
vaccinated, while the rooms were disin
fected. Down at the Harbor Hospital
there was a decided scare.
Mrs. Andrew, the matron, had done
everything in her power for Gustin, and
Driver Kelly had given her assistance.
Drs. Hopper and Fine had examined the
patient, while Drs. Fitzgibbon and Oliver
had been in to see him several times.
Mrs. Reid, the night matron, and George
Liby. the driver who is on night duty,
had also been in attendance upon Gus
tin.
When the news of the death reached
the hospital Dr. Fitzg'bbon at once vac
cinated all the persons named. He de
clined to be treated himself, saying lie
had been vaccinated six months ago. The
others wiinlii not hÂ» denied, hnwover, and
while some held Fitzgibhon, Dr. Fine vac
cinated him over the right knee. Each one
as he was cut with the lancet gave a yell
of pretended pain and fear and by the
time the last operation had been per
formed there was a crowd of several hun
dred people around the hospital.
Dr. Sussdorff hopes the scare will has
ten the erection of a building by the Su
pervisors in which persons suffering from
contagious diseases may be placed. At
present they endanger the health of the
inmates in the great public institution.

VERBAL RAILROAD INSPIRATION.
THE Evening Post of this city ought to be inter
esting to theologians. It is probably the only
existing and conceded specimen of plenary and
literal inspiration. Not dnly its ideas but its lan
guage . such as it is, are inspired directly by the Mills
thai grind unceasingly in the yellow building at the
intersection of Market. Montgomery and Post streets.
On Thursday it transmitted to an incredulous pub
lic a few of the latest railroad falsehoods. The Mar
ket Street Kail way Company has asked the Super
visors for so much of the earth, with two or three
trifling reservations, as lies on the northern side of
th<- city, between Market street, the bay and the
it, and a large proportion of the territory on the
southern side, between Market street, the bay and
the divi-hng line between San Francisco and San
Mateo County. It has pieced out and adjusted its
ing franchises so as to exclude all possible com
petitiou. It pr, /poses to connect the Post street and
the Geary rtrcet systems by a new franchise for one
k on Taylor street, which also unites with an old
unused franchise that ought long since to have
been forfeited It has also directed its agents in the
board to confer upon it a new franchise along Grant
avenue from Geary street to Bush street and down
to Sansome street. It has further ex
n of Montgomery street, of Sansome
street and of Battery street
These are only portions of the intricate network of
franchises and privileges of which the present clean
up of the Market Street Railway Company is composed,
but they arc sufficient for our present object, and the
omitted parts oi the gigantic scheme have been more
than once recapitulated in The Call. Surrounded and
entrenched by all the other franchises and privileges,
it has offered to surrender its existing cable franchise
on Geary street in return for a now franchise "to run
fifty years, but for the initiatory five without any
contribution to the municipal treasury. On this
street, between Grant avenue and Taylor street, it
claims to own another old and unused franchise,
so that on so much of the route it assumes that in
additi -ion it has a double grip. The
Street Railway is now substantially part of the
Market Street Railway system, but it has a s<
lity to bondholders of $671,000 that will not
ire until 1921, or about eighteen years after the
present franchise will expire. This deliberate fraud
is to be ratified by the new franchise, and it hae been
dy pointed out by The Call that, with this ac
quisition for fifty years ami an expenditure of
>00. interest at 5 per cent per annum on at least
two millions could be secured.
The railroad, through the Post, on Thursday last
ited the Geary street application from the re
: of the swindle in which it is an important
element, and, treating it as standing by- it -elf, inquires
why, if it is so valuable, the proprietors of three
morning newspapers that oppose the projected fraud
cannot singly or collectively outbid the Market
Street Railway Company and thus reap the larpe
ley anticipate from the steal. "Does any one
believe," says the railroad or Mr. Huntington or the
or all three â "that if this franchise had one
tenth of the value that it is asserted to have by
, Hearsi and De Young, any of
mid hesitate for a moment to secure
it over the Market street company, which, it is
â¢ think of bidding anything like what
the franchise is worth? Here are three millionairesâ
men who are Looking for business investments â
loudly clamoring that a valuable franchise of the city
is being given away, when any of them could 6ecure
it by making a fair bid therefor."
And, to clinch the proposition, attention is railed
fact that no immediate payment of money is
d, but that the responsible bidder-, offering
the lai .. ntage of gross receipts will take the
â 
There are numerous answers to this correlation of
impudent mendacity. The Market Street Railway
ipany, which evidently has not examined its own
charter in connection with the Illinois decision
Pullman Car Company, considers adver
: tisjng a legitimate part of the railroad business. It
does not follow th;<t the owners of newspapers should
ide the purchase of street railway franchises as
mpaniment of that kind of investment.
But the truth is that, when the deary street franchise
is offered the Maria-: Str< el Railway Company will be
cessarily the # only bidder. Of incalculable value to
If, tin- purchase would he worthless to any other
idual or corporation. The monopoly, with its
dv] . im on four blocks of Geary street and
entire line flanked by and connected with
other branches of its gridironed system, could
afford to corrupt a dozen Boards of Supervisors, at
the highest known rate.-, in order to consummate its
â  '(â -a!'.- robbery. But it can laugh at competition
! the gullibility of any citizen who would believe
one of its false and bold assertions.
There are only two real questions in this business.
in-;. has a bare majority of the Board of Super
under the lead of a majority of the Street
Committee, absolutelj agreed in advance to adopt
the legislation dictated by the monopoly? To this
question an affirmative answer has already been twice
given. â  md, can ;â¢ bare majority control the
'i. or i- it i>. . â¢ ssary to override the veto,-, of
tyor? Th< opinion seems to be that
section 68 of the consolidation act is hoi inconsistent
â .\ii!i the statutes of [893 and i*> 7, and so far there
; no evident c that two more votes arc in the market.
It cannot be too thoroughly drilled into the public
thai this shameless attack upon the municipal

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., SATURDAY, MAY 27. 1809.
MORE REPUBLICAN OPPOSITION.
=I^X-GOVERNOR BOUTWELL of Massachu
setts is among the Republican leaders who op
pose imperialism. He has been Secretary of
the Treasury and has long been prominent in party
affairs and public matters. His words of warning
added to those of Republican United States Senators
and of the President himself deserve attention and
should be heard and heeded.
One of the most eminent of Western Governors
was William Larrabee of lowa, long a member of the
State Senate before his election for two terms as
Governor. He is now, by appointment of Gov
ernor "Shaw, chairman of the Board of Control,
which has charge oi all the State institutions, and is
lecturer on constitutional law and civil government
in the State University. In a recent lecture in that
institution he said:
"The President is not justified in the measures he
is now using and the plan he is following. We who
oppose expansion are called little Americans, while
those 'big' Americans are pursuing a course that
will bring disaster to our nation. The Philippines are
a country totally unfit for habitation by Americans
and offering no advantages except to a few ad
venturers. The people are 10,000,000 of the worst and
most unmanageable in the world. It will take a thou
sand years to teach them the first principles of Ameri
can citizenship, and as long as we hold them we will
have the opportunity to pay war taxes -and stain the
soil with the life blood of our young men. A great
mistake has been made. It was easy at one time to
avoid it. If the President had instructed the Com
missioners who made the Paris treaty to unload them,
instead of paying the price he did for this worthless
class of people and this non-productive land, the
question would not have appeared. It will cost this
country $50,000,000 per year to hold the Philippines
and the blood of many of our citizens. The islands
will be a constant drain on our population and our
purse, and, as for me, I wouldn't give the life of one
lowa boy for the whole land and its ten million
people."
These expressions were received with every demon
stration of favor, tor Governor Larrabee is a much
respected man and of great influence in his State. It
is noteworthy that the thoughtful opposition to im
perialism comes from the Republican party. Colonel
Bryan, who a year a^o wont to Washington and ad
vised war because it would be "good politics," is
crying in more or less of a wilderness against expan
sion, but the motive is the same â a desire to make
politics and seek party advantage. In his case the
(.lenient of principle is lacking, and if positions were
reversed he would as readily join Senator Morgan
and the Democratic expansionists as stand where
he is.
The matter is one for the deepest nnd most pro
found Republican consideration. Neither the Presi
dent nor the party is committed to any permanent
. A strong imperialist party exists within the
tanks of both parties and is trying to manufacture a
for the President and to whip the country into
it. There is no evidence thru these fanatics represent
him or that lie is in sympathy with their repudiation
of the Decalogue, the Declaration of Independence"
and the constitution. Indeed there is every ground
for belief that he will promptly purge himself of any
suspicion of sympathy with their mi-Republican propa
ganda. The most respectable opinion in both par
ti* s is opposed to the imperial scheme. By this we
mean the men who r.re in no sympathy with Bryan's
use of the issue as a jimmy to force free silver into
the treasury policy. Republicans who believe in lAn
roln and revere his memory cannot brook the policy
of holding subject races. To them it is as offensive
as to hold slaves. The hiiji and mighty doctrines of
the party, conceived upon the- best ideals and, held to
1 roled the i as dear to Republicans
now as when they were inscribe. l upon it > banners
in 185 ft and triumphed in iB6O. When those ideals are
exchanged for their antipodes the party will have
parted with its Hf< apd its epitaph may be written.
AN ANNOYING TANGLE.
ATTORNEY GENERAL FORD'S recently
submitted opinion that the office of Commis
sioner of Public Works h.Ts no longer a legal
existence brings to light another evidence of the
carelessness with which legislative work is done at
Sacramento, and the carelessness in this case is the
re annoying because it may compel a cessation of
I river improvement at a time when it is urgently
needed.
It appears from the record that no doubt can exist
as to the intention of the Legislature to continue the
office, which under the original art terminated March
I. The act which was sent to the Governor, however,
and signed by him, was not identical in form with that
which was passed by the two houses of the Legisla
ture. The Attorney General holds that the defect
vitiates the whole act, and consequently that the office
has landed.
A test case on the i^sue will of course be promptly
made up for submission to the Supreme Co.urt, and
ir is fair to presume an early hearing and decision
will be given by that body. In the meantime, how
it is probable the Board of Public Works will
have t-i suspend operations. In fact, H. J. Corcoran,
a member of the auditing committee, is reported to
have said: "The auditing committee's hands are
tied, and not one step further in the direction of
river improvements can be taken until the Legisla
ture meets and passes a new act creating the office."
Mr. Corcoran takes, perhaps, too hopeless a view of
the situation. Where legislative enactments are
vague in their terms Supreme Courts have not in
frequently construed them according to the plain in
tention of the framers, and such a course may he
taken by the court in the present case. Should such
be the decision ol the court the cessation of the work
i if river improvement would he for a shorter time
than Mr. Corcoran fears, and the wrong done to the
State by the carelessness of the officers of the Legis
lature would be less than he supposes.
The incident serve? to point once more the familiar
moral of employing competent and faithful clerks for
the performance of all the clerical work of the legis
: lative body. It has been the custom to make the dis
tribution of clerkships and offices of all kinds in con
nection with legislative sessions the spoils of party
politics. The persons chosen as attaches arc hardly
ever fit to (In anything except the lower sort of cam
paign work. They take their positions at Sacramento
as payment for past services and rarely think of giv
ing any earnest and careful service there. The conse
quence ft that bills are shuffled and huddled along
from one House to another and from the Legislature
to the Goyernor without much regard for accuracy.
Thus, unless the legislators themselves keep close
watch on measures in which they are interested,
blunders are almost certain to be committed. In the
present case the blunder is an annoying one under the
j best 'terms that can be made of it, and may prove to
j be costly in the extreme.

American Baptist Publication Society
in Convention Listened to the
Deeds of Its Noble Workers.
Missionary Sermon to Be Delivered on the
Sabbath Morning by Rev. Mr. Lorimer.
Detroit Gets the Next Baptist
Anniversary Celebration.
MISSION work and SiTnday-^hooi? '
were the all-absorbing topirs at
Baptist convention yesi
day. The American Baptist Pub
lication Society continued to hold
the attention of the convention. The offl
led th. sens of honor on the
platform, and Its speakers delivered the
able addresses and conducted the discus
sions which followed.
Several important announcements were
made. Detroit was decided upon as th*
meeting-place for the annual Raptist
iiration. and Kansas City
was selected for the meeting in 190 L
The morning session opened with the
*;pual devotional exercises, after which
: Emanuel Bap
tist Chun \ â¢: â  ted the re
committee on the publishing
tment. In presenting the report the
er made an earnest appeal for de
nornlnational literature, and ?poke in de
sition to any step toward the j
â¢ -called undenominational liter-]
On this point he said :
"Christian literature givp? an upward
trend to the materialistic life. When we
take up a hook we want to know where
it comes from. Is it from the realms of
or from the -world? Christian
iture tends to bring into the home,
an uplifting Influence. Christian litera
ture is not weak. Anything that fastens '
man's hold on tho immortal Is strong."
Rev. L. 1... Henson, after reading the re
port of the committee that had been ap
pointed on the missionary work of the so
ciety, delivered an address in which he
emphasized the importance of some of
the features of the varied work of the
great society. He began by saying that
he was not before Ihe society to try to
â  Bay anything new, but simply to call at
tention to Borne of the facts which of
themselves were ever new and startling
enough. After making some comparisons
between conditions at the time of the be
ginning of the society's work and those
of the present day, he continued by say
ing that the society does a pioneer work.
The colporteur and missionary, whether on
foot or horseback, whether in wagon or
In car. in seeking for, and in finding the
masses who refuse to come to the gospel
is doing foundation work and will form
the basis for all denominational work In
the future. After noting some of the re
markable things that the society has ac
complished, he said that In this way we
can evangelize the country districts. This
getting hold of the young people before
they go to the city will not only save
them, hut esetablish so many pure foun
tains of Christianity which flow into the
city church.
Rev. Jay Pruden, who has been doing
missionary work in Utah, followed the
Rev. Mr. Henson, and told of his ex
perience among the Mormon* The Mor
mons he declared, were deaf to the words
of the Savior, and many more mission
aries were needed In the land of the Lat
ter Day Saints. , . ;- /â -;
Rev. G. â â  erg of Washington told of hie
work among the Danes and Norwegians,
and Rev. C W. Gowen of Idaho spoke
of the good work of the "Frontier Col
porteur."
In the afternoon the committee on Bible
â work submitted the following report:
Whereas, The open Bible in the bands of the
common people la now and has ever been the
bulwark of l'rotJ-stanfism.
Whereas, Without this book in the hands and
homes of the people the highest forms of pa
triotism ami the loftiest ideals of government
must decline. *â ;, r.
\\h- reas. Philanthropy and all higher forms
of benevolence mitigate- the conditions of
the unfortunate and helpless and Inspire dl
rectly from its teachings and suggested by its
example.
Whereas, The American Baptist Publication
Society is distributing over a million copies of
the Bible, thus greatly aiding and facilitating
the work of both the Mlssl'/nary Union and
Home Mission Society; and
Whereas, The attitude of other Bible societies
In reference to translations to be used among
heathen nations make It a necessity that Bap
tists, if they would give a fully translated
Bible to the heathen, must maintain a Bible
society of their own. And as the recent series
of commentaries and the translation of the Old
Testament to be issued In the Immediate future
an<l the revised New Testament, already in the
hands of the people, are works for which the
Baptist denomination should be i profoundly
thankful; therefore be It ';; -j
Resolved, first, we accord our gratitude to
Almighty Ood for the blessing which haÂ» In the
past attended the effort? of the society In
printing and distributing the word of God.
Secondâ That we indorse its continued efforts
to jive the word of- God to the nationÂ» of the
earth through the DOSt perfect and complete
translation of the original.
Thirdâ That the Baptists of America be urged
to remember more generously the Bible depart
ment of the society and that all churches and
Sunday-schools be requested to emphasize Bibie
d&y and if poslFble to Increase their donations.
Rev. Kerr P. Tupper's- paper, ".The
American Baptist Historical Society."
was the most Important paper of the
afternoon. The speaker pal( i In part:
As our Missionary Union has for its supreme
object and end the sending of the Gospel to all
land*, ana our Home Mission Society labors to
â â  . . .
supply specially the needs of the ehurehless and
the unchurched of the I'nlted States and our
Publication Society to circuit*- the word oi
Â«;â â¢! and other uplifting literature throughout
the land, and our Educational Society di
Its energies to thÂ» endowment and development
n Institutions of learning, so our
His; rical Society is inspired by a deep and tn
nt .lcsire for collecting and preserving the
â¢ God 1 S dealing with his ;
illy it is interested in gathering mate
rial respecting our denomination in Its -â -.â 
uttering tor truths sake, in Its support
and defense of New Testament prlncli â :â¢
doctrine and government.
Few thlnes. perhaps, are more needed anv>ng
Bai tisU than tht> .-ulture of the historic Bpirit
possession and cultivation of thl?
cannot fall to Impart to our brotherhood a
unity, an esprit de corps and efficiency unpos
! sespcd by us at present. True, the history of
i Baptists has In part been toldâ all materials for
a fuller revelation of it are yet "to be gathered
i in Europe and America, and to be intelligently i
! Interpreted to our people. Gathering this mate
rial; We must publish It, BO we may tell anew,
and tell more fully than ever to the world the
wonderful things God has. done for up. and
this cannot well be done without the financial
j aid of the denomination. Every organization
| must have financial basis. Three things the
historical craves and should have: First, an
annual offerUig from each of our churches; sec
ond, $10,000 for a fire-proof building for the
preservation of th" society's library and manu
scripts, and 1100,000 for an endowment fund.
Income, of which could lie applied to the noble
enterprise, to the accomplishment of which the
society has set Itself.
The report of the committee on reso
! lutions, submitted and adopted, was as
follows:
1 Resolved, That In view of ; the vast and
vital interests Involved we express our grati
fication as to the complete agreement con
cerning the prosecution of the work of this
and of the Home Missionary Society.
Resolved, That we rejoice in the manifest
tokens of Cod's blessing upon the chapel cur
work and do commend It to the prayer and
co-operation of the brethren.
Resolved, That the great need of the times
is a more diligent, faithful and Intelligent usÂ«
of the Bible. We urge a vigorous prosecution
of Uible work.
Resolved, That we are In full sympathy with
our brethren of the religious bodies and with
all the lovers of law, order and decency In
their efforts to prevent the gating of Repre
sentative-elect Brigham Roberts, from the
State of Utah, in the National House of Rep
resentatives because of his known and self
confessed practice of polygamy. We emphat
ically urge our national Representatives to take
all proper action in the premises.
Resolved, If agreeable to our sister societies,
that we accept the cordial invitation from De
troit Baptists to hold our next anniversary In
the Woodward Avenue Churon of that city.
We also advise the favorable consideration of a
hearty Invitation from . the eleven Baptist
churches of Kansas City to meet there In 1901.
Resolved. That we thank all railroads for
special rates and courtesies extended to us. .
Resolved, That we hereby express our hearty
appreciation and thanks .to the Baptist pah
tors, brothers and sisters of San Francisco and
vicinity for their generous hospitality and In
terest in our comfort and welfare.
Rev. D. P. Ward closed the afternoon
session with the -following paper on the
Sunday school work on the Pacific Coast.
The first Baptist Sunday school on the Pa
cific Coast was organized - by Henry Sewall in
the house of David Lennox,' at West Union,
near Portland, Oregon, June 9, 3844. K. H.
Lennox, now living In Oakland, was a mem
ber of that Sunday school.
The first Baptist Sunday school In California
â was organized by Rev. 0. . C. Wheeler nt the
house of Charles L. Ross in Sao Francisco,
May 27, lbia. We have to-day 400 .Baptist
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAIAx. SATURDAY, MAY 27, 1899.
Sunday schools on the Pacific Coast, with 22.
--t'"ii members.
The first colporteur of the Publication So-
ciety was Rev. Richard Cheadle, who was
ail-inted for Oregon In 1853. Rev. Orln Crlt
tenden. now residing at Mountain View, was
a faithful colporteur of the Publication So
ciety In California in the fifties.
The first Sunday school missionary was Rev.
W. J. Lough rv appointed for Oregon In 1872.
Â°n the Ut of October, 1895. your speaker
commenced work as Sunday school missionary
"f the Publication Society for California. In
l""klng up new fields I have been in many
Counties never before visited by a Baptist
bunday school missionary.
In the spring of IS'JS I visited Stanislaus and
Tuolunine counties with brother Henry Jack
son, a colporteur of our publication society.
We drove over 200 miles In a cart, and held
ORB in mining camps, school houses and
private houses. One place we visited they had
had but four sermons in eighteen years. We
viMt.-d another j/lare where we found sixty boy*
and L-irls In the public school, and no religious
â¢ii C any kind in the community. Th->
children all held up their Hands and said "WÂ«
want the Sunday BChool." Brother Jackson
returned the following Sunday and organized
a Sunday schoqj.
In the fall of 1596 I visited the northwest
part of the State, and held meetings with
our people In t... great redwood section. Men
â loelno County has the largest per cent of
Baptist Bundav schools, of any county In the
State.
In June, isfts, in company with Robert Whlt
aker, our. genera] missionary, and H. E.
Adams, nf gospel wagon work^ we made a
tnur Into the northeastern part of the State.
In Shasm County I spent a couple of days In
:i town where there were several hundred men
working in a copper mine, and scores of boys
and girla there, but no Sunday school or
â  aay kind whatever.
we organized a Sunday school there. In
ibis same county. In company with Brother
McCart, we organised a Sunday school in seven
<!ays.
A large part of the time of your Sunday
achool missionary has been occupied in visiting
v schools and In holding Sunday-school
institutes. We need better Sunday-school
ing and management as much as we need
more Sun lay-schools. A good, live Sunday
school institute Is one of the best things a
Sunday-school can have during the year.
Hut perhaps the mev-tlngs that your speaker
has enjoyed the most of all have been the
:.â¢ and girls' meetings. Surely If we are
to take this Pacific Coast for Christ it will
t di ne by reaching the boys and girls in our
b and our Sunday-schools.
In three years and seven months I have or
â¢â â¢i fifty Sunday-schools, distributed Z:O2
ipiea of tliH Scrlj'tures, visited and addressed
nday-schoole, held 60 Sunday-school in
-tltutes and given 11S9 addresses arid traveled
J. 075 miles.
We need a genuine revival of Interest In
he Sunday-school work on the part of church
members. Every Christian that Is able to
jet to Sunday-school should be in Sunday-
I every Sunday. How .shall we hold the
rat here in Sunday-school is a more difficult
I roblem than how .Â«hnll we hold the boys.
We need a missionary spirit in our churches
in planting and sustaining new Sunday-schools
In needy Reids in the vicinity of our churches.
Last, but not least, "we need a half-dozen
;olporteura of our publication' society of the
I'ni'le John Vassal type, going from house to
house and from town to . town, loaded with
Maptlst literature and ruble? and Testaments,
'-.oidins boys' and girls' meetings and organ
izing: .â ^iinday-sehools. The Baptists, of this
ast appreciate the Interest of the publica
tion society in sustaining a few laborers on
this coast; but what are these among bo many?
Our State Sunday-school Association reports
"00,000 boys and girls of school age in this
State not in any evangelical Sunday-school.
In a single county there are forty-nine school
nouses in which there is no Sunday-school or
rfiipious service in the community. Let us
not give less for foreign missions; in fact, let
us give more; but let us not forget the .boys
and girls that are perishing for the bread of
life at our very doors.

Tho church was crowded to the doors
in the evening, owinp to the announce
ment that Rev. Dr. rlenson of Chicago
was tn deliver an address <^n the work of
the American Baptist Publication Society.
1 >r. Ileus. hi is nothiiiK if not original, arid
his remarks kept his audience applauding
or laughing almost every moment he re
mained on hla foot. Referring to the fart
that many doubters claimed that the
Bible was comrade-ted by the facts of
modern science,, he assured his hearers
thai they need have no four that any as
certained facts of science would contra
dict the Word of God, toy the hand that
created the Bible created the world. But
there wire other works not created by
God, he said, which Rood Christian's
Bhould ho warned against, He referred
to iho multitude of novels that are being
distributed broadcast all over the land.
He declared they were the works of the
devil and that they were doing more to
aid the work of his Satanic majesty than
anything In tho last century.
"The devil Is no .longer the blackguard
which lie has been painted," said Dr.
Henson. "He Is a polished gentleman,
who floats about in respectable society In
an atmosphere of lavender and writes
novels, the pages of which are tatnfed
with the vilest suggestions and the filthi
est assertions ever evolved in the brain
of a human being. It is no use to preach
against them, for the more we say about
them the rriore anxious the people are to
see for themselves if they are as bad as
we paint them. The only way to do Is to
crowd them out with better literature â
such literature as is published by the
American Baptist Publication Society.
"We have got to work like the 'dlvll' to
boat his Satanic majesty at his own game.
We have got to go way back to the young
people. The American boy of to-day. is a
pretty old boy and the American sinner
of 26 to-day is further advanced in de
pravity than the sinner of 75 a score of
j ( ;'irs ago."
1 >r. Henson deplored the fact that there
Were co many denominations of Chris
tians. He believed that the only religion
was the religion of the Bible, In. this wa .
THREW HIMSELF
IN FRUIT OF A
MOVING CAR
Frederick Rothaus At
tempted Suicide.
WAS HUNGRY AND FRIENDLESS
HIS WIFE SICK AND UNABLE TO
CARE FOR HERSELF.
The Unfortunate Man Claims He Was
Weak From Hunger and
Fell Across the
Track.
In a fit of despondency due to his In
ahility to procure employment Frederick
Rothaus, aged 40 years, living at 9 Carlos
plare, attempted to onimit suicide yes
terday hy throwing himself in front of a
Sutro electric car at Thirty-second and
Clement avenues. Seeing him lying on
the track the motorman quickly reversed
the current and applying the brake
stopped the car when it was within a few
feet of the unfortunate man.
When questioned Kothaus denied that
he contemplated suicide.
"I was walking along the avenue," he
remarked, "when I suddenly became
faint and fell across t lie track. I heard
the car approaching, but was unahlc to
get out of the way."
Notwithstanding his denial the police
say that Rothaus was bent on committing
>uii'i,!,'.
In his report filed with the Chief of Po
lice Officer Richter says that Rothaus
was Kfpn to throw himself across the
track whin the car was within a hundred
feet of him. He appeared perfectly con-
Bcious when rescued from his perilous po
sition, and severely upbraided the police
mar, for what he termed his "show of au
thority."
Thinking ho was mentally deranged
Richter summoned the patrol wagon ami
had him conveyed i" the Receiving Hos
pital. He was closely questioned By the
doctors, and as be did ri> > t exhibit any
symptoms of insanity be was discharged.
To Matron Keane the unfortunate man
said that he formerly worked at tho CHIT
House as v waiter, but was discharged a
short time ago. His wife suddenly be
came sick and as he was financially un
able to engage the services of a physician
he had her Hint to a friends house,
where sht was promised at least enough
i<> eat. Yesterday after brooding over
his troubles, he concluded to visit the
Cliff House in the hope of getting some
thing to cat and perhaps employment. Hi
walked as far as Thirty-second avenue,
when his strength failed him and he fell
across the !r:;ck.
"I am sorry the car did not pass over
me," he lugubriously remarked, "al
though 1 did not think of committing
SUKicle.
"Hunger no doubt made me weak and
unable to continue on my journey to the
i Jliff House and I fell down."
The surgeons in the hospital, tout hed
by Rothaus 1 sad story of poverty and
misfortune, intend to-day to assist him
in procuring employment.
nection lie paid his respects to the parlia
ment of religions Ivld In Chicago during
the World's Fair.
"The parliament of religions was the
greatest menagerie ever gut up," he re
marked. "It brought us all sorts of so
called 'religions' from all parts of the
earthâ Theosophy and Christian Science
among them. Christian Science is nothing
but heathenism brought over and galvan
ized. The devil is busy manufacturing
counterfeit 'religions' all the time, and he

OFFICIALS
WHO BELIEVED
IN PECULATIONS
The Marine Firemen's
Funds Stolen.
PATRICK ROGERS DEFAULTED
WARRANT ISSUED FOR HIS AR
REST FOR EMBEZZLEMENT.
He Has Followed in the Footsteps of
Bernard Ward and John Dough
erty, Now Awaiting
Trial.
The officials of 'the Pacific Coast Marine
Firemen's Association have apparently In
the past Imagined that they had a legiti
mate claim upon the funds of the organi
aztion and Jtilized them for their own
uses and purposes.
Bernard Ward, an ex-treasurer of the
association, and John Dougherty, an ex
tinanclal secretary, are now awaiting their
trials before the Superior Court on
charges of embezzling the funds of the
association to a considerable amount, and
now another ex-financial secretary is
wanted on a similar charge.
Yesterday Andrew Pryal, the present
trtasurer of the association, swore to a
complaint before Judge Mogan for the ar
rest of Patrick Rogers, ex-linanclal secre
tary, on the charge of felony embezzle
ment, the particular amount specified be
ing $50. A demand was made yesterday
upon Rogers by Pryal for the return of
i h<- money, but he said he did not have it,
hence the warrant.
Rogers was appointed financial secre
tary after Dougherty, but was deposed
about three months ago aft^r the expos
ures in connection with Ward and Dough
erty, and since then Pryal and the present
financial secretary, Hell, have been care
fully examining the books. They allege
that they have. already discovered a short
age in Rogers' accounts of nearly $2000,
made up of various small sums, chiefly
Tor initiation fees of $50 each. It will be
impossible for some time to ascertain the
full amount of the defalcations of Rogers,
as books and vouchers required cannot be
found to be submitted to experts who
have been appointed to go through the
books.
Rogers was a witness against Dough
erty, and when Dougherty was examined
he declared that the money he was
charged with embezzling had been given
by him to Rogers.
Rogers was around the City Hall yes
terday afternoon with the object of sur
rendering himself, but when he discovered
ihat he would have to give heavy bonds
he left for the purpose of securing bonds
men. He says he can prove that he has
not embezzled a cent of the money be
longing to the association.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC
LOSES SOME LAND
SUPREME COURT DECIDES IN
FAVOR OF SETTLERS.
Important Question Determined in
Contests for Odd Sections in In
demnity Grant Limits.
A decision of the Superior Court of Los
Angeles County in two important railroad
land cases was upheld yesterday by the
Supreme Court. The Southern Pacific
Railroad Company, brought separate ac
tions against Frank A. Wood and others
and Frederick B. Jacks anjl others. By
an act of Congress of 1866 the railroad
company was granted every odd section
of land lying within ten miles of its line,
which grant was for the purpose of as
sisting in the building of the road. The
lands In question in this action, now well
settled, He within the indemnity 'limits of
the grant to the railroad. The defendants
claim the land under patents Issued to
them as settlers under the land laws of
the United States. To the complaints to
oust them from the lands the defendants
put in a demurrer, explained in the last
decision, and from which the railroad
company appealed. The sustaining of the
demurrer also sustains the claims of the
settlers, and as there are no doubt many
similar cases of settlers within the in
demnity limits of the company, the de
cision is of no small importance. An In
teresting point is brought out by the
higher court in this language:
Whatever right the plarntlff asserts or may
have Is based upon said act of Congress of
1565 and its own arts thereunder, while the
defendants" rights are based upon the pre
emption laws of the United States and their
compliance therewith; and as the defendants'
patent was issued I prior to the selection of the
<ame lands by the plaintiff they must have a
better right if said lands were subject to pre
â¢mptlqn; and that they were so subject unless
withdrawn from pre-emption by the act of
1866 or by executive action thereunder Is not
questioned. Section 6 of said act (above
Tuoted) provides: "And the odd sections of
land hereby granted shall not be liable to gale
or -entry or pre-emption before or after they
are surveyed, except by said company as pro
vided In this act"; but it is further provided
that the pre-emption act of 1841 and the home
stead act of 1562 and the acts amendatory
thereof "shall he and the same are hereby ex
tended to all other lands on the line of said
road where surveyed, â¢ excepting those hereby
granted to said company."
The court upon this point takes the
view that: "The title of the grantee re
lates back to the date of the act, but does
not attach to the lands to which the
United States did not have full title at
that date, or were otherwise excepttd
from operation of the grant, even -though
they should afterward be freed from
claim or possession which excluded them
under the grant," and In conclusion says:
But it Is not necessary to a rtecinion of the
preoent case to decide that question (the right
of the Land Department to withdraw certain
indemnity lands from settlement), for as these
lands were not withdrawn hy force of the
act of Congress, and the withdrawal having
been revoked, and as the complaint does not
allege that Wood?' settlement was made be
fore the revocation, or while they were with
drawn. It Is not shown that his settlement was
Illegal or unauthorized or that the patent was
Improperly Issued.

KNOCKED DOWN
AND KICKED
BY FOOTPADS
Startling Experience
of Dr. Campbell.
FELLED WITH AN INSTRUMENT
WHILE PROSTBATE HE WAS
BEATEN AND KICKED.
His Shouts for Help Brought a Citi
zen to His Assistance and the
Daring Highwaymen
Fled.
Dr. J. H. Campbell, 3153 Twenty-fourth
street, is nursing a pair of blackened eyes
and a swollen face and bruised head, the
\ result of an unexpected meeting with two
footpads late Wednesday night. The de
tectives have been notified of the affair,
but so far no arrests have been made.
Dr. Campbell was on his way home
Wednesday night about 11:30 o'clock, and
when he was walking along Twenty
fourth street, between Florida and Bry
ant, two men jumped out of the shade of
a building and ordered him to throw up
! his hands. He was not quick enough tn
obeying the order and one of them struck
him nn the head with some Instrument,
knocking him down. The blow did not
render him unconscious and he shouted
lustily for help.
This angered the two footpads, and they
kicked the prostrate physician on the
head and face, apparently with the object
of rendering him unconscious. The doctor
continued to shout for help, and fortun
ately a citizen swung round Bryant
street, and as soon as the footpads saw
him they took to their heels and disap
peared. The citizen assisted the doctor
to rise, and helped him home.
Dr. Campbell is still suffering from the
effects of the severe beating he received
and is thankful that he escaped more se
rious injury and that he was not robbed
of his money and watch. He is satisfied
that the men's object was robbery and
they would have accomplished their pur
pose if the citizen had not appeared op
portunely on the scene.
Owing to the darkness he was unable
to give a correct description of the two
men, but one was short and the other
tall, arid both appeared to be young men.
Chief Lees instructed Captain Gillen to
detail Detectives Graham and Fitzgerald
on the case, but there is little chance of
the identity of the footpads being dis
covered. ____________

Mrs. PmKham's Advice Saved
Mrs. Hayes From an Operation.
[LETTER to MRS. PIHKHAM MO. 64,283]
" DearMrp. Pixkham Words cannot
express my thanks to you for your kind
advice to me in regard to my health, I
had been running down in health for
about seven years. I had doctored
with good doctors and taken a great
many patent medicines. .My trouble
began when my first child was born.
I had a very hard time and after its
birth would have severe flooding spells.
" After my second child I had very
' good health until last winter when I
again became pregnant and suffered
very much and miscarried. I came
very near dying, and the doctor said I
must have an operation, which fright-
ened me very much, and concluded to
write to you for your advice, and take
your medicine. Was troubled with the
whites, great pain in back and hips,
sometimes when lying down or sitting
was unable to get up. Would have
such pain in groins could hardly walk.
"I can say I have never seen any-
thing so wonderful as.Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound and Sana-
tive Wash. Your remedies have done
wonders for me. Hoping that many
of my suffering sisters may be led to i
take your merficine from reading this !
letter, I remain, sincerely yours, Mrs.
Mary Hayes, Hardinsburo, Ky."
Letters like the foregoing should
convince everyone that Mrs. Pinkham's
advice is certain help.

OREGON FRUIT AND GRAIN CROPS.
B. S. Pague, section director. United- States
Department of Agriculture for the Climate and i
".ull-tin of the Weather Bureau, Oregon ,
gives the condition of the fruit and ,
grain crops f"r the week ended Monday, Muy (
- follows:
The bulletin for the corresponding week last
y.-ur announced general rains and low tem
perature, bo opportune they were and the
great benefit to crops. The same conditions ;
II this year, but so much weather of I
Line kind bus preceded that, instead of a I
benefit, it has been injurious The soil is
nd wet. Seeding has been delayed, and
now cannot be finished before June 10; then,
(should warm, dry weather prevail, the late
Bprlng crop will not amount to much. Fall
* wn grain lias made little growth, "though it
; . ,\ . llent stand; early sown spring grain
is doing well on the higher land. iVarmer
â  r will be of great benefit to the grain
â 
Fruit continues to drop, and especially so
for prunes. In some orchards the Italian
will be an absolute failure; in others,
v small crop is probable. The Petite and Sil
.nes have not fallen so badly, an.l they
! to give a fair yield. Cherries
,rs have been dropping, but. as a rule,
ropa will be had. The peach crop in
tl> southern counties is good; in the northern
counties there will be very few tor shipment.
Apples are yet blooming and a good crop Is
led. The cause "f the dropping is evi
dently due to the cold soil and absence of
heat to force the sap up the tree; the fruit
is therefore literally starved to death, and it
Irops to the ground. The fruit, to-day,
promises I i be a smaller crop than was ever
grown in the Stius.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 26.â market opened
â¢with a continuance of the upward movement
which was in force yesterday. Yesterday's
sharp advance brought In a moderate vplume
of buying orders to the commission houses,
â¢which were .put in at the opening. There
mini to have been also considerable enthu
siasm awakened in the American department
of the London market by the same cause. The
International stocks were bid up there before
the opening here, and the arbitrage brokers
promptly bid them up to a parity here. It
coon became apparent, however, that the bull
party were no more prepared to make exten
sive commitments on the eve of a holiday than
the bears, and the activity soon came to a
standstill. The feverish and erratic tendency
of Consolidated Gas helped to unsettle the mar
kets. Its sudden drop was supposed by out
eiders to indicate some new possibility in the
franchise tax laws, and other stocks in the
eair.e group fell away in sympathy. When the
announcement was made of the action of the
gas directors in reducing the Quarterly divi
dend rate from 2 per cent to 1% per cent there
â was some recovery in the stocks of other New
York municipal corporations. As a rule the
prominent high-priced specialties were weak.
Sugar was a conspicuous sufferer on account of
the reduction in the price of cube sugar, which
presaged another stage of a war of sugar pro
ducers and effectually demolished the recently
current reports of an agreement upon which
the stock had advanced. The extreme decline
5n Kaa was ten points, and it closed only a
quarter above that. Sugar lost six points, but
rallied three and closed with a net loss of 3%.
Both American and Continental Tobacco,
American Steel and Wire, Anaconda and Amer
ican smelting were points of weakness. Man
hattan, Brooklyn Transit and Metropolitan
Street Railway recovered a large part of their
losses. When the selling movement had spent

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NKW YORK, May 86.â Hradstreet'e review of ,
the stock market to-morrow will say: A. dull
and heavy t .ne prevailed during the early part '
of the week. Support was again Riven to the j
share market by large financial interests, but
this manipulation was not sufficient to over
come the Effects of the liquidation of public ,
speculation holdings. Industrial stocks were |
particularly affected by this tendency and on
Wednesday the declines in a number of the ]
newer securities of that class became rather :
pronounced and encoiinigi-d bear operators to i
attack the general stock list. The strength of I
the railway bund market was a feature, but
neither that nor the steadiness ot some of the
prime dividend-paying railroad shares seemed I
to have any effect "n Btocka in which quota
tlons have been inflated or which are widely
distributed among the speculative public. <>n
Thursday, however, the market rallied and the â 
t^ar interests covered short contracts sufficient ',
to cause some of the earlier declines to be re- I
gained. The fact that the Stock Exchange
market will be closed on Monday, as well as
for the legal holiday of the succeeding day,
tended to induce caution on the part of the ;
newly formed short interest among the pro
! fesslonals, and the support given by powerful !
I houses to various specialties also seemed to
1 have some weight. Another circumstance which
appeared to contribute to this end was the
passage at the extra session of the New York
Legislature of the amended franchise tax law.
The unfavorable reports as to crop conditions
were used with some effect upon the grangers
and Southwestern stocks, but It was noticed j
that the groups in question participated in
Thursday's recovery in the face of a further
advance in the price of wheat, and on Friday
Atchison preferred was conspicuously and ex
ceptionally strong. Little apparent response
was given by the stock market to the comple- j

of the amalgamated copper subscriptions, with

statement of last Saturday, with a gain of j
over $7,000,000 in the surplus reserve, also fell .
flat at first, but some influence, both on the j
demand for bonds and on the general specu
lative situation, may be ascribed to the In
creased ease of money, which was a feature j
in the latter part of the week. London took
little part in the proceedings here at first, the j
markets on the other side beine dominated by
j the usual Whitsuntide holidays. At their con- !
I elusion there was, however, some foreign buy- |

Anacunda shares. Foreign exchange also 'pre-
I Rented renewed evidence of weakness in the
j latter part of the week, largely in consequence
! of this foreign buying of securities. The mar
ket as a whole continues to show that the puh
| lie interest in speculation has been decidedly
checked. Commission house business was far
I from- active and the disposition to liquidate
j speculative holdings asserted itself in the
face of evident efforts to support prices, while,
as was natural under the circumstances, the
be.ar traders have shown much greater activity
than for some time past.
BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK, May 26.â Rradstreet's to-mor
row will say:
Favorable features of current trade still, as
for a long time pa?t, largely outnumber those
of an opposite character. Wholesale distribu
tion Is naturally less active as the season ad
vances, but comparisons with last year are
still very satisfactory. Much is hoped for from
better weather conditions stimulating retail
trade hitherto held in check by the backward
spring season. Industrial activity Is wide
spread and the prices of most staples are either
, vety firm or tendjne upward, except In the
easel of products affettrd by weather condi
tions. That often relied upon barometer of gen
eral business conditions, the iron and steel
trad", report:? increasing rather than lessening
ac ivtty, notwithstanding the approach of
warm weather. In some lines. In fact, the
situation is becoming rather excited. The pres
sure of consumptive demand really seems likely
to either do away with entirely or shorten very
appreciably the summer shut-down period.
Features in this trade are "very heavy buying by
prominent interests in the Central Won. ad-
I vances In :>r.o.-s f f all trades of piiriron and
i many varieties of the more finished product
and predictions of still higher prices to come
coupled with denials by leading Interests of the

cations are. that the volume of business now
beinc done or offered is far in advance of all
pn vious records. Export trade is feeling the
check, due not entirely to advancing prices.
however, but to actual inability to take new
business at any price.
The. market for manufactures of cotton '" n
i second to that of Iron and steel, strencjh
being n feature in nearly all the branches, and
a I'iimber of advances being registered for the
week. The raw product, however, reflects lit
tle of this strength, though the advance in fin
istiec'. products may be taken to have offset
slightly improved crojj conditions, a result of
n led rains. Wool is rather less active so far
as new business is concerned, but reflects re
cent heavy speculative buying and relatively
higher prices at interior points than at the
seaboard in firm quotations. The demand for
lumber and bulldinc materials generally con
tinues unabated, and there is talk of brick
manufacturers following examples set by other
trade--- anil combining to regulate the output.
Raw sugar is firm, and the opening of the fruit
season gives confidence In steady nrices for thÂ»*
regned article. Boots and shoes hold recent ad
vances, and hides and leather are firm in sym
pathy. The trade situation is, however, "not
entirely without Us drawbacks. Reports from

DUN'S WEEKLY REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. Mar 2G.â R. G. Dun's wefkly
review of trade will Kay to-morrow:

than tho habit of fear,. Men have found for ko
many years disaster treading on the heels of
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SATUKDAY, MAY 27, 1899.
apprehension that they lack faith in good
things present and to come. Every year there
is worry about short crops, and yet the crops
grow larger. The specter of monetary trouble
haunts men who know that the country is
strung beyond any need. Promoting methods
alarm men who are already quite aware, that
it is only needful to put promoted stocks in a
class by themselves. But all the time the vol
ume of business is rising, this week"s pay
ments through the chief clearing-houses being
61 1 per cent larger than last year and 68 per
cent larger than in 1592. For the month thus
far the daily average is 57.9 per cent lnrn>>r
than last year and 66.4 per cent larger than
in 1892. Moreover, this week and every other
brings larger wages to many and increased
purchasing power, and the demand for pro
ducts is consequently expanding in all branches
of consumption.
The rise in Bessemer pig iron to }17 65 at
Plttsburg, $2 in two weeks, in grey forge to
$15 25, in Anthracite No. 1 here to $16 75 and in
local and Southern iron at Chicago, results
directly from the fact that suppHes are less
than the demand. Many more furnaces are in
baste to begin work, some succeeding but
others hindered by difficulty of getting prompt
deliveries of needed parts of machines or
prompt supplies of ore and fuel. The natural
remedy that new orders now call for less work
than was done in April or March is for the
â¦Ime hidden by engagement of nearly all con
cerns for months ahead. The largest and best
works are catching up with their orders,
though much behind and obliged to refuse
many, while ethers are entering the field. It
la proof of an astonishing demand that after
nearly five months this congestion continues
and the rise in prices, including advances of
J2 epr ton in plates and bars, is not forced or
unnatural.
Minor metals have followed London so long
that tin sticks at 25.65 cents, though stocks are
large and the demand is remarkably poor and
lead at $4 45, though the demand is slow, while
copper weakens to IS 1 ? cents for lake, British
statistics indicating a fall of nearly a quarter
In consumption for four months this year com
pared with last.
The. heavy sales nf wool, 30.9M.00H pound? at
the three chief markets in three weeks, against
20,780,300 for the same week in 1K97. when the
disastrous speculation of that year had be-
Kiin to turn, and 14,212.150 in 1892, are mostly
to speculators, as manufactureâ¢ are doing
scarcely nothing. Weeks Ago they held that
prices were too high even after some decline,
for the prices at which goods could be sold.
But Western and Eastern speculators have
settled it that the manufacturer will be forced
t,i buy at such prices as they may fix and are
taking large quantities.
The cotton mills have a fairly good de
mand after a 1 considerable advance in
prices of gonds and â  are producing
largely. The market has been steady at S l t c,
with no ground to expect much change, and the
best reports indicate a decrease in acreage of
4 per cent.
Wheat advanced 2 cents, but lost nearly
all the gain on Friday. Western re
ceipts have fallen to about half of last year's
and exports In four weeks from Atlantic and
Pacific ports have been 15,5>90.1CS bushels, flour
Included, against 13,691. 552 bushels last year,
while from Northern lake ports 7, 926. '137 bushels
have pone out this year. But men forget that
foreign demand, if not as large as it was last
year, with famine Impending, is much larger
than in the same weeks of LSItT, when wheat
exports were only 5. 704. "34 bushels, and also
forget I^eiter speculation caused a wholly un
natural May movement last year, for the West
ern receipts in the past four weeks. '.',280.665
bushels, compared with 19,266,263 last year, but
9,961,670 in the same weeks of -1597, and re
serves In that year were not specially reduced,
but closed quite large enough.
Failures for the week have been 142 In the
United States, against 245 last year, and 16
in Canada, against 21 last year. .

the market weakened ajrain and closed within

OREGON.
PORTLAND, Or., May 26.â The local wheat
market took a spurt, this afternoon and 59c was
bid for Walla Walla, with reports that a cent
better had been offered at points in the interior.
But few of the exporters care to quote thii
high, most of them quoting 5Sc. The same par
ties who were paying 55c for Walla Walla re
fused to quote over 59c for valley, but blue
stem can be worked at 61c.
WASHINGTON.

half cent in the local market to-day, under the
effect of an improved tone in the dispatches

from Oregon, 950 tons; two from Newcastle.
N. S. W., 7441 tons: total, 25.353 tons. Sales
and supplies this week -jus* about tally, so that
but little has been hauled Into yard, de
liveries being made from ship's side; this
proves quite an advantage to the sellers. Prices
! remain unchanged, the only grade ', which in
i very firm at asking price is Australian, as j
' tonnage there Is scarce, hence â  freights are
\ strongly maintained. It was naturally antici
pated that with our crop prospects, coal freights
from Australia would have been 50 to 75 cents
per tan lower than are now prevailing, but
the Liverpool wheat market is very low and
shows but little vitality, so that our shippers
are Indifferent about chartering, and grain
freights are neglected. This cannot endure
much longer, the farmer or the shipowner must
| succumb, so charters may be effected.
Coal consumers arc- not suffering, there is
sufficient coast fuel arriving to keep the wheels
turning." .

WRITES TO THE MAYOR
Review of Past and Present Con
ditions in the Islands.
Philippines a Land Rich in Natural Wealth
and Resources Natives Not to
Be Depended On.
MAYOR PHELAX is in receipt of
an interesting letter from Gen
oral James P. Smith, who is at
present in command of the
United States forces in the
Island of Xegros, P. L The letter deals
â with the conditions now existing in the
newly acquired territory and besides
being instructive is particularly inter
esting to Californlans when considered
in the light of the future intimate re
lation?, business and social, that will
prevsiil between this State and the
PhiliÂ£9ises. Following is the letter in
full: '
Headquarters, Sub-military District of
the Isle of Negros, Bacolod, P. L, April
11, 1579.
Hon. James D. Phelan, San Francisco â
Dear Friend: I must apologize to you
sincerely for failure to suitably acknowl
edge up to this time the many courtesies
and kindnesses which you have unremit
tingly extended to this regiment md to
myself. My only plea in mitigation is
that the excitement of campaigning,
changes from one station to another and
routine, and detail work involved my pri
vale correspondence in such confusion
that up to this time 1 have failed to meet
the obligation due both to friendship and
to courtesy.
I have received many letters from
friends and relatives of some of the boys
< f the regiment, asking me to secure
their discharge from the service. To
many 1 have explained that the power
to discharge those unlisted in the service
does DOC reside with me save upon ex
piration of term of enlistment. Many of
those who have commimic-aied with me
on the- subject, however, have not been
answered, as owing to my departure to
the island of Xegros 1 was compelled to
leave much of my correspondence in Mi
nila. Will you be kind enough to have it
announced that such applications must
be : .it- by the enlisted men to the Secre
tary of Wax. through military channels,
a.nd thai until a suitable force of regulars
is on the. ground ready to lake the place
of volunteers it is not likely that such
applications will receive favorable con
sideration unless the enlisted man be so
disabled as to be Unable to perform mill
tary duly.
1 have noticed that some of the papers
have exprÂ«%sed dissatisfaction that 1 have
not ta.kt_n some steps to have the regiment
sent home. That course was not open to
me. inasmuch as every man in the regi
ment pledged his service to the Govern
ment lor two years. Of course there was
a mo: obligatiun on the Government to
dispense with the volunteers as soon as
the necessities of the case would permit,
but for my part 1 felt that the conclusion
of peace with Spain would not be an end
cf the trouble. 1 have always believed
from the very first that the conflict with
Aguinaldo and his ambitious leaders must
comt, and thai neither diplomacy, kind
treatment nor guarantees of any kind
could avert it. From 1 â 'â â¢ time of our
arrival in Luzon on the 30th day of June
to the present hour not one act of kind
ness on the part of AguinaJdo to the army
can be shown as an earnest of his good
will toward the United States. On the
contrary, everything that could bo done
to annoy, harass and embarrass the op
era lions of the. American land forces was
done. With this state, of the case con
sULnllv before my eyes and knowing that
two independent armies could not long
claim jurisdiction over th( same territory
without a collision, I could not well put
the regiment in a. discreditable position
by asking thai it be sent home- when al
most iU. any moment active service might
begin. In that opinion 1 have always felt
1 have had the support of an overwhelm
ing majority in the regiment. I am cer
tain that when the Government has no
further use for their services they will
f>f nd the volunteers to the homes and oc
cupations to which they have been ac
customed, and no one prays more devout
ly for the speedy arrival of that hour
than l do, but the country is the best
judge of the time when our service - can
be dispensed with, and to that judgment
we must obediently submit.
Rumors have come to me from the
United States by private correspondence
and otherwise that I am being out in j
training for some political office. This, in
justice to myself. i cannot permit. I vol
unteered, as did all the others of the
regiment, from no selfish motive, and I
cannot by my conduct give justification
fur the statement, that my service has
been actuated or induced by any other
motive. At present 1 feel that I enjoy the
good will of all the citizens of my State;
not for what I have done, but by reason
of what the regiment has accomplished.
and 1 do not propose to create any other
feeling through the medium of a politi
cad campaign or to take advantage of a
sentiment which belongs to the regiment,
a_n4 not to me.
My out; ambition In life to see active
service has b*-en gratified, and 1 .shall be,
perfectly content to return when the war
[a over to the peaceful pursuits of civil
life, where I may without dispute retain
the friendship and reaped of all my fel
low citize.ns regardless of party or politi
cal affiliations.
Of the Philippine Islands much has been
said in the columns of the papers and
much In the magazine articles concern-
Ing tbÂ«tr beauty and resources, but
they mast be seen to be ap
preciated- The soil is inexhaustibly fer
tile and produces sugar cane, coffee, to
bacco hemp, rice, the ' cacao bean from
which chocolate is made and the fiber of
the ptna and jusi cloth. In th- interior
of ail the islands is to be found great
forests of valuable woods untouched by
the hand of man. Of it 3 mines but little
Is known, save thai coal beds are a cer
tainty and of a great extent. Many ex
perts assert, however, that the coal is
what might more properly be called lig
nite-. Some gold has been found in the
beds of the rivers, and it is said that
there are rich stores of thÂ« valuable metal
in Luzon and Mindanao. .
These tale* of rich gold deposits lack
confirmation, save in the particular that
gold is to be found, but where and in
what quantities has not been definitely
determined. With all its agricultural re
fconrces, wealth of valnable woods, stores
of ecu) and probably gold. 300 years of
Spanish rule has brought about but little
of devclopmtTU and nothing of the nat
ural progress which such resources would
seem to jusiifj-. Spain, as far as her civil
and military administration was con
cerned, appears to have confined her ef
forts to the territory in the vicinity of
the. coast line. Vast â¢-. â¢- of territory
in the interior were ]Â»-ft practically un
der the independent control of the' na
tive tribes and rupees who. with the ex
ception of the missionaries; seldom saw
a Spaniard, and so the development of
the interior has riot been .in proportion
to the resourres, and little development
made can be attributed wholly to the mis
sionaries.
Rice and cane fields are cultivated with
a wooden plow. Cr<-aÂ»s axe out with a
wishbone, ha vice a. rude knifu lixed in
one of the arms. The rice is separated
from the husk by striking it in a wooden
bowl with a long stick and is winnowed
by the slight breezes that sometimes blow
in the Philippines. The sugar cane is J
crashed beneath rude rollers, trodden out !
â¢with the feet, boiled In funny vats and :
finally resolved Into crude brown sugar,
fine la , lily, but nnlmiUngr in appear-
There arc no eairialllji In thÂ«Â» woods.
no pLanlng-xmlls to smooth xtu-. surface or
the lumber, and smooth floors and pol
fahed surfaces -'?"â  produced through the
medium of the hatchet and the exercise
of muscle. The Jukl and pina cloth are
woven with hand loom* and the produc
tion of a single drees tnÂ«-an3 a world of
labor and an eternity of patience, ThÂ»
hemp. or. rather, abaca, is broken out
by hand, bat the factories which make
the rope into which it develops are at
JJongkong. not In the PhlUnpfnes. The
coffee tree* are shaken and those beans
which drop are gathered; those which re
main upon lbe trees are not and are al- i
lowed to spoJL The tobacco industry is I
the most adVatnoed of all those In the |
Island* and is probably the only one In ,
which methods have reached a high slate; J
of perfection. Outside of Manila there
are no electric lights, gas lights,
or lights at all except those fur
nished by candles and coal oil.
Luzon has one steam railroad, 160
miles long. There are no other railroads.
Electricity as a motive power is unknown
and streetcars have no existence outside
, of Manila.
It seems to me, inexperienced as I am,
that the Philippines ought to be a para
dise for the capitalists who wish to in
troduce electricity, put up sugar refin
eries, build sawmills and planlng-mills,
Intro modern agricultural implements
and all kinds of machinery. The Island of
i Negro.-, on which I am at present locat
ed, is rich to a degree, and the sugar
planters live like princes of olden times,
it has progressed more than any of the
other islands in agriculture, yet there is
much to be done to bring it to even a
moderate state of progress. It has 217
rivers and streams emptying into the
ocean, few roads and no kind of transpor
tation save th.-Â» carabao, whose trotting
record Is about a mile a month.
The people of the Islands are not capa
ble of self-government considered as an
entirety. There are certain classes, how
ever, whom 1 think might be safely en
trusted with the reins of local self-gov
ernment. The educated class, the prop
erty-holding class and the householders
who have the responsibilities of families
and property, might, i think, be allowed
the privilege of the ballot, and under
proper protection, encouragement and ad
vice would in all probability in a very
short time establish a stable form of local
government Underlying these three
classes of inhabitants in the Islands are
the irresponsible^, who live from hand
tc mouth and who only work when com
pelled by dire necessity idlers who will
not work at all and prey on their fellows
ana the savages, who, of course, have no
responsibilities and have no desire to as
sume any. In my opinion the idlers and
Lrresponaibles ought to have no voice in
: the government at all, but they form an
i element dangerous to the peace and wel
fare of the community, being read) at all
times to fall in line with the discontented
or ambitious because they are "agin" and
ever prepared to overturn existing condi
tions. I think, however, if the Irresponsi
bles and idlers were utilized for military
purposes and to form a local can:
iary that under the. Influence oi~ discipline
and education they might in time become
i useful citizens.
The present trouble In the islands arose
through no fault of the military power
ati Manila. Everything was one to con
vince the leaders of the insurgents and
the people thai the United States intended
' nothing but what was for ihÂ± welfare of
| those who had been oppressed so long.
i Amicable relations were encouraged in
! every way by General Otis. The insur
i gent soldiery and officers were permitted
j tree entrance into Manila at all times
I and at ail hours and were allowed to come
, and go a.s they pleased; bu: the mortal
offense has been given on the 13th of
August when the insurgent soldiery were
not permitted to enter the city and loot
it to their hearts' content. For that in
jury. th~re was no forgiveness and ex
pressions of open disapproval of the
Americana began and the Government of
the United States which had lifted the
yoke from their necks was openly claimed
to be an enemy to the people greater than
Spain. The American troops were not
j permitted to go into the country with
' out being constantly interfered with, fre
j fluently annoyed uiiJ sometimes arrested.
j Manila was virtually beleaguered by bos
tiles who only waited the word to begin
operations against the forces whose kind
ness, forbearance and leniency the un
grateful Tagalos had mistaken for cow
ardice.
LÂ»ai]y for a month their soldiery stood
: upon the trenches, defied our sentries to
combat, calk-d them women, spat upon
; them and invited them to come over and
have their throats cut. Conferences were
held with the leaders and representatives
of the insurgents, but their demand for
absolute independence, their insistence
th*t our navy should not be further
strengthened, and that the regular troops
should not be permitted to land, coupled
I with the threat that unless these things
were promised the people could not be re
strained, and that trouble would begin,
I rendered futile all efforts to bring about
a more satisfactory condition of affairs.
I The insurgent paper, the Lndependencia,
! took the stand that the attack should be
gin at once on the Americans; that the
regulars were not coming for the pur
pose of relieving the volunteers; that the
conferences- were being had for the pur
pose of accomplishing delay, and that the
Yankees wanted to gain time for rein
forcements to arrive and so be enabled
to cope with the force about Manila.
Insurgent colonels and captains began
to warn their friends in Manila to leave
the town â that it would be certainly de
stroyed.
Arms were secretly smuggled into the
city and secret societies' for the purpose
of murdering American officers and burn
ing the town were formed in every dis
trict. The insurgent lines were advanced
until their sentries brushed elbows with
ours. Enlisted men were- seized within
our own lines and carried to Malolos.
Products were not allowed to be sent Into
the city, and about everything that could
be done was done to cause the American
forces to take the initiative and lire the
first shot. This plan which was probably
the result of deeper counsels than their
own, did not succeeedâ the shot was not
fired.
Then they began to send armed men
across our lines in broad daylight, but
after threats, protests, menaces and nego
tiations would withdraw them. Finally,
on February 4, the Filipinos determined
â¢ to force the first shot, and at night they
sent an armed party across the line of
one of the American sentries located at
Santa Mesa. The sentry called "Halt,"
the armed party halted, consulted and
then retired. In a few minutes it re
l turned. The sentry again called "Halt"
and persisted in calling "Halt" until they
had crossed his lines. They would not
I halt, and then he fired his piece. That
; was the signal the Filipinos were waiting
for. The immense string of insurgent fire
crackers, having its large end at Calocan,
| from which it stretched to Santa Mesa,
, had been ignited at the smallest diameter
: in Santa Mesa and the insurgent fire, at
j will, in a short time spread from one end
: of the insurgent line to the other. They
; rang out the volleys at Santa Mesa. The
Nebraskana had tumbled out of bed and
got to work. Next came the volley firing
at Sanpaloc and vicinityâ the Colorados,
I Montana* and Dakotaa bad rushed to the
support of their threatened outposts and
pickets. Last of all the steady tire of the
i Pennsylvanians, Third Artillery, and
Kansans showed that they had buckled
1 down â to meet .the heavy attack on the
| Calocan front. Now and then a heavy
i gun would "boom," showing by the sound
from the water or from the land whether
the execution was being done by the navy
or the Utah Battery.
â¢ Bo was the second battle of Manila
brought about by the very people on
whom kind treatment was worse than
wasted and by whom courtesy and con
sideration were taken for timidity and
fear. The fight waged ail night on the
north side of the river, and with the break
Of day the conflict spread to Santa Ana,
Singallon and Malate. These are the
facts as 1 understand them concerning
! the commencement of the struggle be
tween the Americans and Filipinos. God
knows an American was compelled to en
dure almost everything rather than do
anything which might bo ground for com
plaint or bring about a rupture of peace
ful relations, yet I am sorry to say emi
nent and able men of my own nation have
seen fit in the halls of Congress and from
the rostrum and pulpit, to denounce the
action of the American soldiery at Ma
nila and to assert that the conflict was
, initiated to force the treaty in the inter
est of annexation and imperialism. The
truth is the insurgents had determined to
crush us before the regular regiments ar
rived and the Americans had the choice
of being crushed or fighting. They were
i not crushed.'
Truly this letter is already too long, so
: I will bring it to a close by renewing: my
' thanks to you for all you have done for
the California- boys, and remaining, as
I ever, yours sincerely, .
JAMES F. SMITH.

REPRESENTS DEWEY'S
FLEET AT ANNAPOLIS
AHX SOLDJVULN, ihe Ycung .Native Son
wfyo H as Received an Appointment
to t^e 13 S. .Naval Jlcademy.
MAX GOLDMAN, an apprentice on the Concord, and a native of this city,
has been appointed to a cadet ship at Annapolis and is ordered to re
port at the academy on September 1 for examination. The fortunate
young Californian has been detached from the Asiatic squadron and
is expected home on the transport Solace.
His appointment is due to the efforts of Congressman Julius Kahn, who
was anxious that a representative from Dewey's victorious fleet be given
an opportunity to rise above the ranks. The choice fell on Max Goldman, and
througH the intervention of Secretary of the Navy Long the native son was
thâ¬ appointment. Goldman and Osborn W. Dignan, the boatswain who
steered the Merrimac \inder the direction of lieutenant Hobson, will enter
the Naval Academy at the same time, the former representing Admiral
Dewey's fleet and tho latter Admiral Sampson's.
Goldman was born at the Potrero and received his education in the Irv
ing M. Scott School. Ho always had a longing for tho sea. and when but
16 years of age he enlisted as an apprentice on the receiving ship Indepen
dence. He was shortly afterward transferred to the Concord, which was
ordered to the Asiatic station. Young Goldman served on the deck of the
Concord with distinction during the battle of Manila Bay, and for his gal
lantry and bravery he was mentioned in general orders and promoted to the
position "f a gunner's male's apprentice.
Having always had an ambition tÂ« go to Annapolis, young Goldman has
pursued his studies aboard ship with unerasing vigor. He has had kind tutors
to direct his studies, and as a result he [g even now ready to undergo the cru
cial test Immediately on his arrival in this city he will be discharged and
will go directly to Annapolis and enter Professor Wilmer's preparatory
school for further instruction.
The friends and neighbors of the Ooldmans, who reside at 1200 Kentucky
street, are greatly interested in the welfare of the young mariner and are do
intr everything in their power to advance his interests. Though but 18 years <>f
age, Goldman is six foot in height and is a splendid specimen of California
manhood. The officers and men on the Concord, and, in fact, in the whole
proud "f him and are. watching his future with deep concern.
WITNESSES SAY
THE CREMATORY
IS NO NUISANCE
More Testimony in the
Garbage Case.
Further testimony was taken by Judg;e
Heacock yesterday in the case of the San
itary Reduction Works of Ban Francisco
vs. the California Reduction Works for an
injunction to restrain the respondents
from collecting sarbajje In the county of
Sun Francisco and removing the same.
,ii;dt;<Â» Hoacock has been engaged for sev
eral weeks in inkinK testimony of wit
nesses as to the Potrero crematory being
a nuisance anil as to tho validity of its
contract with tho city, and several wit
nessea have testified to sickness and death
iii their families caused by the odors and
gases escaping from the chimney of the
crematory whenever lhe wind blew their
way.
Yesterday several witnesses worp ex
amlned to "show that the chimney did not
emit riny unhealthful gases. John Center,
capitalist, swore that he had not been
fible to detect any odor in his neighbor
hood. Thomas Price, chemist, said that
lie had made an examination of thi cre
matory and that hf had found* the com
bustion complete and no bad gases escap
ing. On cross-examination he admitted
that wh*n thf fire was not v. ry hot and
the garbage was smoldering gasos mipht
escape from the chimney, and while they
mi^ht be offensive they would not be poi
sonous.
Dr. Williamson gave hi? opinion that
the crematory was not a menace to pub
lic health.
Is. R. Ellert, president of the company,
swore that he had not beon able to find
a smoke consumer that would consume
"that kind of smokp."

ported that seamen's matters were about
the same as at the last meeting. They
also called attention to the fact that sail
ors from a British ship had deserted in
the harbor last week and requested that
they be treated as. immigrants in accord
ance with a recent decision of the Immi

A joint committee of the Labor Coun
cil and Brewery Men's Union reported
that matters were in a fair way toward
unionizing all brewery employes of the

CHILDREN ON THE STAGE.
Warrants Out for the Arrest of the
Managers of Three Different
Places of Amusement.
The California Society for the Preven

Yesterday warrants were obtained in
Judge Mogan's court for the arrest of Dr.
Fred A. Grazer and Mrs. Ernestine Krel
ing of the Tivoli for permitting the boy,
Arnold Grazer, and the little girl, Hazel
Callahan, to perform on the stage. In
Judge Graham's court a warrant was ob
tained for the arrest of Walter Morosco
in regard to little Mattie Southwell and
against Edward P. Levy of the Chutes and
Mrs. Afldie Sorenson in regard to little
Maud Sorenson. Acting Police Judge
Groezinger issued warrants for the arrest
of John Morrissey of the Orpheum and
Mrs. Lund for permitting little Pearl
Lund to perform.
Kennedy Was Romancing.
Detectives Byan and ODea, who were
detailed en the case of an alleged rob
bery committed in a saloon on the south
east corner of Howard and Fremont
streets, reported yesterday that no such
crime had been committed in the place
named.
The charge was made by Michael Ken
nedy, a machinist, residing at 426 Sixth
street, who stated that he had been held
up in the presence of the bartender in the
place about 11 o'clock Wednesday even
ing and relieved of coin and valuables.
The officers found that Kennedy had been
romancing, as the saloon in question
closes its doors at 8 o'clock. The machin
ist was undoubtedly robbed, but not in
this particular saloon.

DOORS OF THEIR HOME
CLOSED AGAINST THEM
THE LATE WM. PATTON'S SONS
ARE BARRED OUT.
Struggle for Possession of the Dead
Architect's Property Begun on
the Day of His Burial.
ALAMEDA, May 26.â Hardly had the re
mains of the late William Patton, the
pioneer architect, been placed In the grave
his estate became a matter of dis
pute between his housekeeper, Mrs. Fan
nie Ammerman, and his sons. Clarence
and \V;lliam Patton. The boys are barred
from the family residence on Central ave
nue and the housekeeper holds the fort.
The dead architect left an estate rough
worth about $.SO,OOO.
By the terms of bis last will, which
- Senator E. K. Taylor and David
Barry as executors, two-thirds of the
property is bequeathed to the boys and
provision is made for a monthly allowance
for Mrs. Ammerman.
For some time prior t<> Patton's death
hÂ« ;md his sons were estranged. Neither
lived at Th" family residence. They
blamed the housekeeper lor their trou
bles ;iii(l charged that she was consplr
iiiK to get possession uf tlwir lather's
prop< rty after his death.
Yesterday after the Interment at Moun
tain View Cemetery the suns hastened
to Alameda to tak>' possession of the fam
ily residence. .Mrs. Ammerman was there
ahead of them and with the aid of a
Deputj Constable and the assistance "f
the executors of the estate the suns were
k< jit on the outside. They appealed to
the police and Bergeant Kami> went with
and demanded that they be ad
mitted. Those who held the fort only
laughed at the offtv. r.
The boys without stopping to make in
quiries at once jumped at the conclusion
that the housekeeper had triumphed In
her alleged designs on their father's es
tate, and sought Attorney Thomas Grar
rity of Oakland to protect their interests.
SUPERVISORS ARE
ASKED TO ACT
OAKLAND, May 86.â "Resolved, That the Epworth League Alliance of
Alameda County, in convention assembled, heartily indorse and thank the
Supervisor! of the city and county of San Francisco toi tin ir sea] and
Buccesfl in putting down the Ingleside racetrack, and inasmuch :is tlie
gambling mania created and fost<*ic-d at Emeryville is one of the most demor
alising in its effects, we earnestly plead that our county officials take such
action as shall completely remove the evil.
"Resolved, That until such time at; we are able to wholly extirpate the
saloon we are heartily in favor of all ordinances that prohibit side en
trances, that require the removal of screens and forbid the use of rooms that
are locked in connection with the saloon. And we also our hearty in
dorsement to the work of the Anti-Saloon League, which looks to the com
plete overthrow of the saloon."
The above resolutions were passed at the convention of the Epworth
Leaguers last night.
Executor Taylor assured the attorney
that the boys were well provided for in
the father's will, and that if they would
be patient for a few days everything
would terminate satisfactorily.
As has been stated, the sons and the
father have not been on good terms for
a long time. William, the oldest son. went
away from Alameda a long time ago, but
returned when he heard of his father's
illness. A reconciliation was effected the
day before the elder Patton's death. He
assured his son at the time that he had
made ample provisions for him in his will.
Clarence Patton was ordered from his
father's house about two months ago
after he and the housekeeper had had a
dispute. His father agreed to provide him
with food, but forbade him crossing the
threshold of his home. During his term
of banishment he received his meals on
the back porch of his father's house. He
was told that they would be placed there
for him at 9 o'clock every morning and at
3 o'clock every afternoon.
William Patton made many wills, all
of which are in existence. The last one,
made shortly before his death, and which
is most favorable to the sons, omits to
revoke the former testaments and it is
feared that the oversight will bad to se
rious complications in settling up the es
tate.
ENGINEER AGAIN RESIGNS.
More Trouble at the Alameda Electric
Light Works.
ALAMEDA, May 26.â Engineer Messer
of the city electric light plant again re
signed his position to-day. Some weeks
ago, when the City Trustees changed the
rules of the works and so arranged mat
ters that the engineer was forced to work
from twelve to fourteen hours a day, Mes
ser notified them to choose his successor.
The matter was patched up by having
one of the linemen assist the engineer.
Things ran along with comparative
Bmootbness until last night, when Trus
tees Mackie and Schulte of the Electric
Light Committee held a secret conference
lasting until nearly midnight. It resulted
In the order being made that Messer
would have to take care of his engine and
dynamo without assistance. He forth
with resigned. It is stated that there was
a heated discussion at the conference be
iw en the Trustees and Electrician Weise,
and that the bond of official friendship
existing between Schulte and Mackie is
somewhat strained as a result. These
statements were said to have been given
out by the electrician, but he refused
to either deny or affirm them when Inter
viewed by a reporter.
BRAKE BROKE ON
A STEEP INCLINE
NEED OF TWO MEN CLEARLY
DEMONSTRATED.
Accident on Eleventh Avenue to an
Electric Car â Passengers Nar
rowly Escaped.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, May 26.
The breaking of a stout lever this after
noon caused a serious accident on the
Eleventh avenue electric branch road. No
was hurt, but the car was disabled.
But for the presence of the boy who at
tends to the rear end of the cars on this
branch line, there would probably have
been a fatality.
The cars on this branch were for a long
while operated by one man, until an or
dinance passed by the City Council made
it imperative to employ two people on
each car. This afternoon Motorman
Sharp was applying the brake on a steep
grade when the lever snapped right in
two. The iron is fully half an inch thick,
yet it broke with no apparent effort. The
ear at once proceeded to fly down the hill
unrestrained, while the four passengers
wondered how soon they might be thrown
off the track and perhaps killed. The boy
in the rear jumped t" the rear brake and
the motorman quickly reversed his cur
rent, but neither seemed to have much
effect until the car struck the curve at
Twenty-fourth street, when with a si
v. re Jar it was brought to a standstill.
The passengers received nothing more se
vere than a shaking.
ANOTHER SUCCESS BY
THE KNEISEL QUARTET
Partly owing to the excellent impres
sion made during its last appearance here
; and partly owing to the enterprising man
agement of Harry H. Campbell, the Knel
sel Quartet had the pleasure to play to a
', crowded house last evening at Sherman
& Clay Hall. The mere fact that every
i member is a soloist of vast experience
and ability would not suffice to obtain
, such peremptory and effective ensemble
I work. It necessitates a tin.- adjustment
sense of four temperaments to gain
results of such delicacy and distinction.
Particularly impressive was Schu
mann's quartet in F major op. 41, No. 2,
; in which the allegro vivace and scherzo
movements were brought into prominence
; because of the exceedingly dainty and vi
vacious nature <if the quartet's execution.
j Not less Inspiring was the menuetto of
Mozart's D minor quartet and the Largo
'in Smetana's E minor. The latter was
i particularly majestic and rendered with
a breadth and dignity that moved the
audience to enthusiasm.
Altogether the success of the. quartet
was unparalleled in the history of cham
: ber music in San Francisco. "The excel
! lent acoustics of the hall contribute! a
large share toward making the softest
pianissimo and pizzicato easily audible.
! Whoever misses the opportunity to hear
: the Kneisel Quartet will have lost one of
the greatest exhibitions of ensemble work
ever heard. There is but one perfect
: string quartet in America, and that is the
i one of Kneisel.
There is one more concert this after
q, and this is its programme:
H ( v'lnâ Quartet in G major: allegro con
BpiritO, adagio Fustenuto, menuetto (presto),
finale (allegro ma yon troppo)
Beethovenâ Quartet in E flat major, op. 74;
poco adagio (allegro), adagio ma yon troppo,
i>i>;-t(i (allegretto con varlazioni).
S'-huhertâ Quartet in D minor, op. posthum;
alli-yro, andante con molto, scherzo (allegro
i molto), presto.

WILL SEEK REST IN
SUNNY SOUTHERN CLIMES
DR. JOHN GALLWEY LEAVES
FOR AN EXTENDED TRIP.
Will Continue on to Europe to Study
in the Noted Hospitals if His
Health Permits.
Dr. John Gallwey, beloved of a wide
circle of friends, was on the streets yes
terday after a serious siege of illness.
Through too devoted attention to duty,
exhausted nature finally gave way and
the doctor was prostrated. He had as
sumed the exacting duties of Health Offi
cer of this city in the absence of his
friend, Dr. A. P. O'Brien at Manila. This
in addition to his existing practice over
taxed his strength, as he responded to the
calls of all Becking his ministrations.
Dr. Gallwey will leave to-day for Del
Monte for rest. After a brief stay there
be will proceed south to San Diego. If
his health improves, as he and his admir
ers hope it will, he will depart for Eu
rope. While there he will study in the
famous hospitals and clinics. Should he
determine that his health will not per
mit the Euri'pean trip he will return here
after an extended rest and will resume
his practice.

SMUGGLERS DISAPPEAR.
The Boys Miller and Martin Failed to
Appear and the Charges Were
Dismissed.
Thomas Miller and Albert Martin may
now go home, to their parents, whose
fault is that they seem to be unable to
control their children. Yesterday morn
ing Assistant United States Attorney
Banning, by request of United States At
torney Coombs, appeared before United
: States Commissioner Heacock and asked
that the charge of smuggling against the
defendants be dismissed. The reason for
the dismissal was given as the youth of
the defendants, neither being more than
16 years old. The boys had at
i tempted to smuggle 110 cigars between
' them. Smuggling being an offense nun
-1 ishable by imprisonment in the State
] Prison, the United States Attorney did
' not wish to send the boys to the pehiten-
I tiary. He expressed his belief that the ,
boys had been taught a severe lesson and
that they would not again attempt to
commit the same offense.
Since their release on their own recog
nizance the defendants have disappeared.
Martin's mother informed United States
Attorney Coombs that her son left a note
stating that he had left by the Sunset
route and would return "after this trou
ble blows over."
BOYS' SUMMER CAMP.

tion Will Establish an Outing
Grounds for Members.

er, a boys" summer camp will be estab
lished on the southwest coast of Tomales
Bay, in Inverness Valley.
The purpose of the outing is to give the
intermediate class, composed of boys be
tween the ages of 14 and 16 years, a
chance to enjoy camp life. The associa
tion will attend to all the details, and
have everything in readiness for the in
cursion of the young campers. Strictly
military camp discipline will be imposed.
Under "Dr. Dietz, hygienic exercises will
be a feature of the outing, and he will
take charge of the youths who will
make up the party. The camp will be in
readiness for occupation in another week.

HERRIN WAS CALLED
DOWN AT HIS OWN GAME
Mystery of His Action in the Grain
Cases Dispelled.
Edson Gave Away a Plan Hatched by the
State's Attorneys and the Railroad
Was Forced to Quit.
THE mystery that has surrounded
the sudden application of the
S>mhern Pacific Company to
Judge Morrow for a dismissal of
the "grain rate cases" and a dis-
BOlution of the injunction against the
f- per cent rate was dispelled yesterday
vhen the tacts contributing to Mr.
Huntington's sudden action became
public.
Mr. Huntington's motion was made
solely for the purpo?.- of preventing
him and his hirelings on the Board of
Railroad Commissioners plunging into
b pitfall that had been cleverly dug in
The sinuous path they were treading
by the attorneys who have been acting
for the Slat.- in resisting the railroad's
attempt to evade the costs and penal
ties that would accrue when the suits
Bh mid be dismissed. It was a scheme
to entrap the Southern Pacific's presi
dent that would have required all of
the "higher education" that Mr. Herrin
could have mustered to defeat had it
I â  cii that the whole plan was given
away by an inadvertence of Commis
sioner Edson, who, being the one mem
ber on the board who has stood for the
people and his principles, was perforce,
a party to it. As it was Mr. Herrin'a
higher education did the business.
Ever since Commissioner Klaekstock
unveiled the railroads scheme to un
load the costs of the grain rate cases
on the State by introducing Vis resolu
tion the attorneys for the State â Attor
ney General Ford and Attorneys Foote
and Hayne, special counsel for the
commonwealth â have been casting
fib ut for some plan whereby the rail
road's intentions might be circum
vented. They hit upon one when Black
stock, in an open meeting of the board,
asserted that in his opinion no business
â¢ â "Uld be done until the injunctions
dissolved and the cases dismissed,
even if th>- State had to do it. The mi
d, tied the hands <>f the
board and no new schedule of freight
could be adopted until it had been
dissolved.
That tip was all that Mr. Poote
wanted, and calling in Judge Hayne
they decided to appear before the court
and apply, themselves, and in good
faith, to have the injunction dissolved,
but to demand that the suits should be
maintained. Commissioner Edson was
i in and acquainted with the plan
â  lily assented to it.
Tt was arranged that he should go
before Judge Morrow in his official ca
pacity and present affidavits from dif
ferent grain shippers that the injunc
tJcu was no longer a saving agent to
the State, for the reason that the rail
road had be<?n compelled to grant an
even greater reduction than S per cent
by force of competition. He was to
;ikU the court for a 'dissolution of the
injunction, but at the same time was
to make strong objection to a disrrris
9Jil of the suits, upon the ground that
(here were other and more vital ques
lions involved than that of grain rates.
H" was also to demonstrate to the
â mi that the only thing that ham
i the commission in the discharge
its duties was the enjoining order
nd that the dismif-al of the suits was
unnecessary. He was to be followed by
the two attorneys, who would make the
formal motion, based upon his repre
ss i n.tions. Being the only motion be
fore the court, and in line with its
policy, as indicated by Judge Morrow

when he so severely censured the com
mission for applying for dismissal on
behalf of the plaintiffs, there was small
doubt that the motion would be
granted.
Blackstock's declaration that the
hindrance of the injunction was his
reason for moving to dismiss the
suits was nothing more nor less than
;i mask to hide the crafty scheme be
hind it. It was not a question of get
ting to work, but of absolving Mr.
Huntington from tr-> costs of the cases
he had brought and the penalties that
might accrue that actuated his two
hirelings on the commission, and the
fact was plain to any one who cared to
see it.
If the plan of the two attorneys had
succeeded Messrs. Huntingdon, Black
stock and Laumeister would have
found the alleged obstacle removed
from the path of their duty, but with
the cases and the menace they carried
still staring them in the face they
would either have had to go to work
or expose the whole crooked scheme by
making separate application for a dis
missal of the suits. It was a nice dish
of ennv Foote and Hayne had cooked
up for Mr. Huntington and his own,
and thei- might have had the eating of
it but for a slip made by Eds<..n. Armed
with the necessary affidavits he was
told to quietly slide over to Oakland
and wait for the next morning to come
round when he could make his initial
appearance in court. He was warned
to say nothing to nrv ope and particu
larly to beware of his private attorney.
Mr. Edson went to Oakland, but he
disregarded the second half of the in
junction and called upon Morris M.
Estee, his attorney, for advice. To Mr.
Estee he outlined the scheme in all its
elaborate details and discussed it with
him for as much as an hour. Whether
or not Mr. Estee advised him is a mat
ter of inconsiderable importance, but
the fact stands out that within an hour
the whole proposition was ] wn in
the offices of Mr. Herrin an>l a plan to
beat It was already hatching.
As a result, the next morning Attor
ney Plllsbury, Mr. Herrin's associate,
appeared before Judge Morrow without
having given previous notice and moved.
on behalf of the railroad company, for
a dismissal. As Mr. Plllsbury repre
sented, the plaintiff had every right to
dismiss his <i\vn suit, Judge Morrow
granted his request without question,
and the well contrived scheme of the
State fell to the ground.
The only matter left to be settled af
ter the railroad's motion had been
granted was the costs of the suits, and
even in his defeat Mr. Herrin did not
overlook a chance to save his company
from being assessed. Although the mo
tion made by Mr. Pillsbury was for an
absolute dismissal, and made, on be
half of the railroad company, the print
ed application he handed up to the clerk
of the court stated that the plaintiff
did not make the motion, but merely
consented to the motion previously
made by the Railroad Commissioners
on behalf of the State, it was a brazen
scheme to deceive the court and falsify
the records, but it was promptly called
down by the State's counsel and will
have no effect when the court shall
finally fix the costs.

pheasants from New Jersey which will he
immediately distributed for propagation
purposes in a number of counties of the
State. The birds are to be turnea loose
in Santa Barbara, Mariposa, Placer, El
Dorado, Calaveras, Santa Clara and
Humboldt counties. It Is believed that
this kind of game bird will do well in this
State, as they have proved to be very
hardy in even more rigorous climates.
They are protected by State laws and the
Commissioners have had assurance that
the laws will be enforced in the counties
where the birds are liberated.
DIED OF FEVER WHILE
SERVING AT MANILA
BODY OF T. F. SARGENT CAME
HOME ON THE SHERIDAN.
Among the bodies brought back from
Mnnila on the transport Sheridan was
that of Thomas F. Sargent, United States
Hospital Corps, who died in Manila on
August 7, 1898.
Mr. Sargent was a prominent young
man in San Francisco, who had many
friends. He was born in this city and
received his education in the public
schools, graduating at the head of the
class of 1592 and being awarded the Den
man medal. Early in life he evinced great
literary talent and was a prominent mem
ber of several literary and social socie
ties, notably the Athenaeum and Lltera
tium. In the essay contest given by The
Call in 1592 Mr. Sargent won first prize,
the subject of his essay being "Colum
bua." lie often distinguished himself as a
reciter, and many times did the large
halls of this city resound with the echoes
of his masterpiece, "Sparticus' Address
to the Roman Gladiators."
Upon joining the army he was assigned
to the Hospital Corps and detailed as
clerk of Captain Keefer, surgeon of the
Third Artillery. He took sick within a
few days after landing at Cavlte and died
soon after of malignant typhoid fever.
When hostilities with Spain commenced
he had just been appointed to a position
in the United States postal service, hav
ing successfully passed the civil service
examinations; but the thought that he
could better serve his country in other
channels caused him to resign his appoint
ment and go forth to defend the banner of
liberty that he loved and. like many an
other hero, to die, his young life sacri
ficed-on the altar of his country.
Sargent's father fought in the War of
the Rebellion and his brother William
was in the campaign in Cuba with the
Arizona Territorial Regiment.
The funeral will take place to-morrow
morning from the undertaking parlors of
McAvoy & Co., Market street, near Ninth.
An escort detailed from tl*> Hospital ;
Corps will follow the body to St. Pat
rick's Church, where a requiem mass will
be celebrated, commencing at 10 o'clock.
Interment. Holy Cross Cemetery.
IN POLITICAL HARNESS.
Citizens Organizing Clubs With a
View of Purifying the
Municipality.
Somewhat of an innovation in the polit
ical atmosphere is being carried on just
now by the organization of clubs of men
who have affiliated with improvement
clubs up to the present time. Among .lie
clubs organized for political purposes
having in view the production of new ami
better material are:
The Democrats of the Thirty-second
A.->. mbly District, who have just set a
club In motkm by holding a meeting at
959 Bryant street a few evenings ago. At
the organization of this club for better
material the following were elected ofli
cers: Frank Lester, president; Harry
O'Donnell, secretary; John Ryan, vice
president; John Hayden, treasurer, and
James Hamilton, sergeant at arms.. At
the next meeting, which will be held on
next Tuesday at the same place, further
steps will be taken to add other names to
the list of the seventy-five who have al
ready placed their names on the roll lor
good government.
The Republicans, not to be outdone by
their antagonist, have sour Into political*
harness also. The improvement-politico
organization at the west Bide of Castro
street have organized a dub for that por
tion of the city, with the following result:
John Mecredy, president; George B. I>ang,
vice president; C. E. Osgood, secretary;
Samuel Wiedenthal, treasurer, and N. A.
Beck, sergeant at arms.
A federation of Republican clubs was
also organized, with the following offi
cers: President, H. E. Griffith; vice pres
ident. A. C. Brown; secretary, J. Boost;
treasurer, C. K. Osgood, and Joseph Mao
. sergeant at arms. The further en
rollment of members for this organiza
tion will be had on next Wednesday at
Fairmount Hall.
A similar organization of federation of
sts was organized by the Democrats
at 708 Douglas street on Thursday even
ing, at which E. I. Coffee was elected
president A committee with executive
power was appointed, consisting of A. S
Lillie, Captain Anderson, Major B. Mc-
Kinne, James Connors. Robert O'Neill, L,.
Ci. ("lark and J. W. Nixon.
This organization is known as the broad
gauge track, as it will admit all reputable
citizens to membership within its fold,
provided th> y be for gnod government and
for an early and sudden demise of all
"bosses" of the Kelly ~nd Crimmins
breed, who live off "rake-offs" from un
fortunate political worms.
About fifty members of the Thirty
fourth Assembly District met last night
in Harmony Hall, corner of Brie and Mjs
stof, streets, and effected a temporary or
ganization of a Republican club. James
\V. Bounty was elected temporary chair
man. J. E. Johnson temporary secretary
and A. H. Menne, S. J. Hurst. J. Miller,
J. E. Johnson and E. W. Wall were ap
pointed a committee on permanent organi
zation. State Senator S. \Y. Burnett ad
dressed the meeting. It adjourned until
Friday evening next at the same place.

THE FENDERLESS CAR
Life Crushed Out of Little Five-
Year-Old Cortis Mace.
Killed, After Being Mangled Cruelly, in
Front of His Home by a Car of the
Haywards Electric Line.
OAKLAND. May 26.â The electric
trolley car has claimed another vic
tim whose name the clerk of the
death roll can to-night Inscribe be
neath that of little Tommy Kear
ney of San Francisco.
Corlls Mace, 5-year-old son of A. F.
Mace, a widower, residing at 72 East
Twelfth street, was killed in front of his
home by car 38 of the Haywards electric
line shortly before 6 o'clock this evening.
The child had been playing on the oppo
site side of the street with other children
and in running back toward his home the
trolley car struck him. twisted the little
body beneath the ill-improvised board that
could serve only as a fender to remove a
bowlder from the track, and mangled it
into an unrecognizable mass of flesh after
dragging the body about thirty-six feet,
when a pedestrian eye-witness hailed the
motorman to "stop for God's sak>-."
The car had to back in order that the
mangled form might be reached.
The remains were immediately removed
to the child's home, where an inquest will
ho held to-morrow evening.
Motorman If. W. McLane and Conduc
tor G. F. Reinle were in charge of the
electric car, and neither profess to know
how it all happened except that "the
child must have run in front of the car."
James Fell, residing at 061 East Seven
teenth street, was an eye-witness. "Had
there been a proper fender on car 38."
said Fell, to-night, "that child would not
have been killed. I was walking near S. . -
ond avenue and paw the child run across
the street, saw the body si ruck by that
board in front and t isted and rolled up

WOULD PREVENT FRAUDS.
Members of the Iroquois Club adopted
resolutions last night regarding the forth
coming election. The resolutions, present
ed by Max Popper, ask that precincts
contain no more than 200 voters. This
number can be canvassed before midnight,
thus eliminating the danger of fraud. The
resolutions follow:
Resolved. That it is the sense of the
members of the Iroquois Club of San Fran
cisco that the precincts should not contain
more than an average of 200 votes at the
forthcoming municipal election in Novem
ber as it ta deemed inadvisable to Increase
the number of votes cast in one precinct
because of it causing a prolonged count and
relatively tends to produce inaccuracies In
the counting <>f the vote. Be It further
Resolved, That a cony of this resolution
be sent to the Honorable Board of Election
Commissioners.
Distributing Insane Patients.
A. C. Clarke, secretary of the Southern
California State Hospital at Highlands,
arrived in the city yesterday. With him
were twenty-one insane patients, ten of
whom will be sent to Stockton and eleven
to Agnews. This is done to relieve the
congested condition of the Highlands
Asylum. Mr. Clarke states that it has
accommodations for 4fiO patients and they
have been caring for 649, eighty of whom
were obliged to sleep on the floor. It is
proposed to reduce the number at High
lands as quickly as possible.

in a ball and crushed beneath the car. It
all made me sick, but I yelled to the mo
torman to stop, and after the body had
been dragged thirty-six feet he stopped.
Whether the motorman saw the child try-
Ing to cross or not I can't say, but I
heard the bones crack, and afterward told
the motorman he would have to back up
so we could reach the body. It was most
horrible to behold."
Mrs. Wilson, Mr. Mace's housekeeper,
was half beside herself with grief. She
ran out into the street, frantically scream
insr and claimed the remains as one in
her charge. She states that the child had
not been out of her sight over five min
utes when she heard it scream. She was
just preparing supper and says she would
never allow the child to play in the street.
When the father, returning from his
day's work, learned of the awful deatli
of his little boy and viewed the remains,
he wept as though his heart would break.
He was unable to talk.
A careful inspection of the body by Dep
uty Coroner .T. J. Mottel proved that the
child's skull from the forehead to the
back of the head was crushed. The left
side from the armpit to the hip is burned,
the ribs on the left side are scorched,
and the right side is burned through to
the Internal organs, The elbows are
burned. The bone of the right leg is
broken between the knee and hip. and
the knee bone fractured. The jawbone
and nose are crushed.
Some tim<- ago the City Council passed
an ordinance requiring all electric cars to
be provided with suitable fenders for the
protection >>f life and limb. Nearly all
save tlm Haywards line, the Kan Pablo
avenue line, and the Telegraph avenue
linp. In which Huntingdon is interested,
have complied.
Missionites Are Aggressive.
The Mission people are indignant over
the action of the Supervisors in favor
ably considering the proposition of the
Southern Pacific Company to put down a
double railway track along the Mission
belt through the very center of the city.
To give vent to these indignities the
Federated Mission Improvement Clubs
will hold a meeting at Fairmount Hall
Chenery and Miguel streets, to-night at
which prominent speakers will be present
to denounce the newest railroad grab.
Following this meeting will be another
at Mangels' Hall on Folsom and Twenty
fourth streets to-morrow at 2 o'clock in
the aftornoon. This will be in the nature
of a mass meeting, at which all citizen^
are cordially invited to attend.
Town Talk.
The best rartoon that has graced a local
weekly in an age is "They Were All of the
Tom Family," that illustrates one of the
court reporter's pood stories in to-day's
Town Talk. There are some excellent edi
torials in this number, btief comments
upon events of late occurrence at home
and abroad. The critique upon "The
Moth and the Flame" is remarkably in
teresting:, and as a whole the dramatic
department is more than usually
readable this week. The Saunteror has
stories upon Jimmy Swinnerton, "Neally"
O'Sullivan and others, and tells about the
most photographed woman in society.
Plays that have perished, though worthy
of life, is another topic touched upon by
the Saunterer. The usual interesting mu
sical reviews, stories, verses, jokelets and
clever miscellany make up the number. â¢
