to conduct two distinct opera

his Hying column, is moving far around

Norzagay, from which point he will
turn abruptly west toward Calumpit.
This last move will take about ten

The country Is fiat and open and rather

News from the Philippines, though

Filipinos Sunday was not sufficiently

and the gravity o| the work which is

by the officials. The impression pre

CALL HEADQUARTERS. WELLINGTON HOTEL. WASHINGTON,
D. C, April 24. â President McKinley to-day officially recognized
and rewarded the gallant services of Colonel James F. Smith, com
manding the First California Regiment, by making him brigadier gen
eral of volunteers. The Secretary of War said to the Call correspondent
to-night that Colonel Smith's services had been brought to the Presi
dent's attention by the War Department, and that he was regarded high
ly both by President McKinley and himself. The Secretary stated that
Colonel Smith's promotion was made in recognition of his "valiant
service in the Philippines." The War Department realizes that a great
many, if not the majority of volunteers, in the Philippines will desire to
come home, but hopes that general officers will elect to remain there
and that Brigadier General Smith will be of this number.
The Call correspondent to-night tried again to get a definite state
ment from the Secretary of War as to the time the California regiment
may be relieved. The Seci-etary said Otis had not informed him.
"All I can say is that the First California will be the first regiment
mustered out." said he, "and it will be sent home as soon as relieved by
a regular regiment and transportation facilities are provided."

Mac Arthur's lines, now nearly thirty

The signal service corps of the War

FILIPINOS SEIZE
AMERICAN SHIPS
VICTORIA, B. C, April 24.â The Ma
nila Times of March 28, received per
K. M. S. Empress of China, says the
United States gunboat Yorktown has
discovered the long missing trading
steamer San Joaquin hidden in a. creek
near Dugapan. She left Manila on
January 10 for Cagay.-m and Aparri,
and when she was betweeen the ports
of San Fernando and Currimao the
Filipino crew mutined. They murdered
the Spanish captain and the chief en
gineer and took charge of ti-.. ship, the
mates and other officers having es
caped in a launch. They ran the steam
er up the creek and drove her ashore
on a smooth beach. They then looted
her, and after disabling her engines
and demolishing the staterooms, car
ried away all that was valuable in her
cargo.
The long overdue steamers Gloria
and Saturnup also are back at Manila,
The Gloria left on January 10 for Casa
yan and Currimao and the Saturnus
on February 1 for San Fernando and
Aparri. Upon the arrival of each at
Currimao armed insurgents boarded
her and the vessel was ordered to re
main in port. Their cargoes and all
the food they had were taken by the
insurgents, and to cap the climax the
crews deserted, leaving no one to man
the ships. On the insurgents allowing
them to leave port on March 6, the
Gloria left with only the captain, en
gineer and one sailor to man the ship,'
fearing the insurgents would change
their minds and not let them go. The

On March 30 the Yorktown seized
the Spanish steamer Mundara, says
the Manila Times, off the Gulf of Ling
ayen. When first sighted by the York
town the Mundara was entering the
gulf. She turned and ran to sea. The
Yorktown gave chase and fired a six
pounder across her bow and she hove
to. She was brought to Manila. She
is said to have been attempting to fili
buster arms to the Filipinos.
News is given from Leyte Island
that natives of the town of Maltibog
have seized the steamer Victoria, mur
dered the captain and engineer and
captured Mr. Cogan McLeod and the
company's agent, holding them for
ransom. Her Majesty's ship Plover
has gone to the scene.
There still are several American ves
sels missing, among which are the

A BRITISH FLAG
VICTORIA, B. C, April 24.â News
was brought by R. M. S. Empress of
China that H. M. S. Archer, which
sailed on February 26 with sealed or
ders, ha-, returned to Singapore. She
went direct from there to Palawan.
Her orders were received from Eng
land by telegraph. They were to pro
ceed as quickly as possible to Palawan,
where the British flc.g had been hoisted
by the natives. The Archer's mission
was to haul it down.
On arriving off a small settlement on
the Palawan coast the British red en
sign was seen flying, and the ship had
not been at anchor any length of time
before several Filipinos came aboard
and had an interview with Command
er Dare. He informed them he had
been instructed to take the flag down
and that it would be his duty to do
so. Some palaver ensued, in the course
of which it became apparent that the
inhabitants of the town had hoisted
the British flag because they thought
it might afford them protection from

MURDERER
MOORE IS
CAPTURED
Taken Single-Handed by
Sheriff Veale of Contra
Costa County.
OFFICER'S BRAVE ACT
Goes Cut Alone to Meet the Fugi
tive, Who Was Tramping
Toward Martinez,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARTINEZ, April 24.â Without a
doubt Ed Moore, the murderer of Po
liceman Kilroy of Nevada city, is now
lodged in the tanks in the County Jaii
here. The fellow answers the descrip
tion exactly, and he had with him the
Colts revolver of the dead officer. Be
sides he had a sold hunting ease watch
with the initials "I. M. ' engraved on
it. Sheriff Getchell of Nevada City will
arrive here to-morow and take the
murderer back with him.
The credit for the capture belongs t>>
Sheriff R. R. Veale. who accomplished
the feat unaided. Last night a sup
posed tramp called at the farm house
of Janus Kennerly at Bay Point, about
four miles east of Martinez, and asked
if he might sleep under a tree, as he
had walked a great deal that day and
was very tired. 1 Kennerly asked him
why he did not sleep in the small open
railroad station at that point, and he
answered he was afraid the officers
J might arrest him as a hobo. Kennerly
! then told the stranger to sleep in the
barn.
During this conversaton the tramp
was very nervous, and this aroused
I the suspicion of Kennerly. Later in
! the evening a neighbor named Wilds
] came in, and they talked the matter
i over. Both came to the conclusion that
! the tramp must be wanted somewhere.
The more they talked the more con
vinced they became of this. They de
cided to be prepared for anything that
might happen in the morning, and so
loaded several guns about the place.
This morning Kennerly and Wilds
met again, and, on further discussion,
both agreed thai th stranger was none
other than Moore, the murderer of Offi
cer Kilroy of Xevuda City. To be cer
tain of the matter they hunted up a
copy of The Call containing Moore's
picture, and after looking at it and
comparing it with the features of the
stranger, all their doubts were re
moved. After this talk th?y went nut
to the barn where the fellow was lying
down.
Finally Moore got up. shook the hay
from himself, went to the door of the
barn and took a look all around. He
went back, threw his blankets over his
shoulder, picked up his gun, cocked it,
and then started off at a rapid gait
down the railroad track toward Mar
tinez.
Kennerly immediately hitched up a
team and drove to Black Diamond, a
small town about six miles distant, and
telephoned to Sheriff Veale, informing
him of what had occurred. The Sheriff
was in doubt about the identification at
first, but told Kennerly he would go
out to meet the stranger. Kennerly
informed Sheriff Veale piat as Moore
left Bay Point at about 8 o'clock this
morning he must be almost to Mar
tinez.
It was now getting well along to 10
o'clock and Sheriff Veale started two
of his deputies up the railroad track
along the bay shore to meet the
stranger. At 10:42 o'clock Sheriff Veale
took the Stockton train himself. He
was armed with a Winchester repeat
ing rifle of the latest pattern. Getting
on the train, he met a friend named
Samuels. Both men went into the bag
gage car, one taking a position at
either door on opposite sides. In a
short time the train stopped at a small
flag station a few miles above Mar

tinez. Veale looked up the track and
saw a man walking toward the train.
He concluded it was Moore and jumped
off.
Henry Bonzagni. a 14-year-old boy,
who resides here, was on the train, go
ing to visit his sister, and he got off at
this station and started up the track.
'Come back here, Bonzagni!" shouted
Veale.
This the boy did, and the two got into
the station out of sight and through a
knothole watched the advance of the
stranger. In the meantime the Sheriff
put his rifle together. He waited until
Moore was within about forty feet of
him. Then he stepped out, leveled th"
rifle At the murderer and commanded:
"Hands up."
As Moore is hard of hearing he did
not at first understand what was said
to him, but he stopped walking.
"Hands up, or I will shoot you! I
am an officer!" shouted Veale.
At this Moore dropped his bundle and
his shotgun and raised his hands. Veale
told Bonzagni to search Moore. The
boy did so, and in a few moments
pulled out a Smith & Wesson revolver
of the latest patern.
"See if he has not got another re
volver on him," said Veale, but the
boy replied that was all he could find.
SHERIFF R. R. YEALE.
"Get over on this side," shouted veale
to Moore, and the latter did as told.
During this conversation the Sheriff
kept his rifle leveled at Moore. Bon
zagni then picked up the shotgun that
Moore had dropped a.rjd found that it
was not only loaded, but that the ham
mer was up, showing that Moore was
ready for an emergency. The pack of
blankets was Riven back to the mur
derer, and he was made to walk ahead
and marched to town, Sheriff Veale
walking behind, with the Winchester
leveled at the criminal. The distance
from the point where Moore was cap
tured to town is about three miles, and
this Moore was compelled to cover at
the point of the rifle.
At the County Jail Moore had noth
ing to say. He was searched and a
great many articles taken from him.
While the searching was going on one
of the officers unrolled Moore's blan
kets and inside was a Colt's revolver,
the weapon of Police Officer Kilroy, and
by which identification was made al
most complete. When asked what he
was doing with so many revolvers
Moore had nothing to say. Among the
articles taken from Moore was a hunt
ing-case gold watch and chain, with
a compass fob attached to the charm.
On the outside of the case were en
graved the initials "L M." Besides
this there was a diamond ring, a lot of
aid coins, a gold stud, a razor, a flute,
a snuffbox, a shaving brush, a gold
penholder and pen, a bunch of keys, a
purse containing a lot of specimens of
ore, a pair of spectacles, a box of per
cussion caps, a pearl-handled knife, a
plain gold band ring, a gold ring with a
chain setting, a German silver tobacco
bt/x, a time-table of the Southern Pa
cific, a memorandum book, from the
cover of which the name of the owner
had been scratched, and a small bar of
silver with the name "1. Getchell" on it.
After Moore had been thoroughly
searched he told Sheriff Veale he
wished to communicate with a friend,
but when the officer brought him a
telegraph blank and pencil Moore said
he felt tired and would postpone the
matter until later. Moore said he felt
hungry and would like something to
cat. The Sheriff took him to a restau
rant, gave him a good meal, and then
brought him back to the jail. After
he was put into a cell he had a chill
and trembled like an aspen leaf.
Sheriff Veale telephoned to Sheriff
Getchell of Nevada City and told the
officer he had the murderer of Kilroy.
The first question that Getchell asked
was:
"Did he have a gold watch on him
with the initials '1.. M.' on it, and did
he have a Colts revolver with him?"
Getchell v.as informed that he had.
"That is our man, then," replied
Getchell. "See that he is well taken
care of, and do not under any circum
stances '"ow him to get away."
This evening a representative of The
Call had a talk with the murderer. He
stated that when arrested he -was on
his way to Oakland to see E. H. Moore
at 666 Claremont avenue, who is a rel
ative of his. Further than this the
man wouljl not say anything. He is
locked up in a steel tank at the jail
and a watc" of two men will be kept
over him during the night. The Sheriff
from Nevada City will arrive to-mor
row morning.

NEVADA CITY, April 24.â This af

Insisted That the Colored Prisoner

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALMETTO, Ga., April 24.â ThÂ»
body of Lige Strickland, the negro
preacher who was implicated J.n the
Oranford murder by Sam Hose, was
found swinging to the limb of a per
simmon tree within a mile and a quar
ter of this place early to-day. Before
death was allowed to end the sufferings
of the negro his ears were cut off and
the small finger of the left hand was
severed at the second joint. These
trophies were in Palmetto to-day. On
the chest of the netro was a scrap of
blood-stained paper, fastened with an
ordinary pin. On one side of this paper
was written:
"New York Journal: We nust pro
tect our ladies. 23, 99."
The other side of the paper contained
a warning to the negroes "le neigh
borhood. It read as follows:
"Beware, all darkies. You will be
treated the same way."
Before being finally lynchM Strick
land was riven - hance to confess to
the misdeeds of which the mob sup
posed him to be guilty, but he protest
ed his innocence until the end.
Three times the noose was placed
around his neck, and the negro was
drawn up and three times he was let
down, with warnings that death was
in store for him should he fail to con
fess his complicity in the Cranford
murder. Three times Â£ \:kland pro
claimed his torr*""" c, until, weary of
useless torturing, the mob pulled on
the rope and tied the end around the
slender trunk of the persimmon tree.
Not a shot was fired by the mob.
Strickland was strangled to death.
The lynching of Lige Strickland was
not accomplished without a desperate
effort tm the part of his employer to
save his life. The man who pleaded for
the negro is Major W. W. Thomas, an
ex-State Senator and one of the most
distingushed citizens of Coweta Coun
ty. He did all in his power to prevent
the lynching of the negro and did not
discontinue his efforts until he had
fieen assured by the leaders of the mob
that the negro would be taken to jail
at Fairburn. One mile fror- 1 where
this promise was made Lige Strickland
was hanged. The negro was a tenant
on the plantation of Major Thomas.
When Sam Hose, the murderer of Al
fred Cranford and the assailant of his
wife, made his confession immediately
prior to his burning, he implicated Lige
Strickland, Hose contending that he
had been offered money by Stricklajid
to kill Cranford. It was known posi
tively, however, that Hose had made
false statements in his last confession,
and many of those who aided in his
burning were disposed to disregard his
statement in regard to Strickland.
Late Sunday night about fifteen men
went to the plantation of Major Thomas
and took Strickland Trom the little
cabin in the woods that he called home,
leaving his wife and five children to
wail and weep over the fate they knew
was in store for the negro. Their cries
aroused Major Thomas, and that sturdy
old gentleman followed the lynchers in
his buggy, accompanied by his son, W.
M. Thomas, determined to save, if pos
sible, the life of his plantation darkey.
He overtook the lynchers with their
victim at Palmetto, and then ensued,
with only the moonlight to brighten
the faces of these grim men, the weird
est and most dramatic scene this sec
tion has ever known.
Lige Strickland was halted directly
opposite the telegraph office. The
noose was adjusted around his neck
and the end of the rope was thrown
over a tree. Strickland was told he
had a chance before dying to confess
his complicity in the crime. He re
plied:
"I have told you all I know, gentle
men. You can kill me if you wish, but
I know nothing more to tell."
The negro's life might have ended
then but for the arrival of Major
Thomas, who leaped from his buggy
and asked for a hearing. He asked
the crowd to give the negro a chance
for his life here on the streets of Pal
metto, and said:
"Gentlemen, this negro is innocent.
Hose said Lige had promised to give
him $20 to kill Alfred Cranford, and I
believe Lige has not had $20 since he
has been on my place. He has never
done any of you any harm, and now
I want you to promise me that you will
turn him over to the bailiff of this
town in order that he may be given a
hearing. I do not ask that you liber
ate him. Hold him, and if the courls
adjudge him guilty, hang him."
To this the mob replied that Strick
land had inflamed the negroes in the
neighborhood and had a bad reputa
tion, having been run away from East
Point several years ago.
Major Thomas reminded the mob
that the negro had voluntarily told ofÂ«>

wisest plan for protection will be for the
Legislature to take vp the matter and
provide a sufficient Stale militia and
funds to be expended for a patrol in tne ;
country districts."
Former Governor William J. N'orthen
expressed himself as follows: "My lir^t 'â 
suggestion is that all homes should be
made miniature arsenals, at least to the
extent of one good Winchester and one
good pistol; that women. be allowed to
carry weapons and taught the use and
handling of firearms, so that they may \
become their own protectors in the ab- j
sence of the husand or master of the j
house. An occasional negro lying dead '
In the back yard; shot by a brave woman
In defense of her nor, will do more to
stop this awful crime than all the lynch
ings that may occur in a year. I would 1
have every county supplied with at least I
half a dozen well-trained bloodhouncs.
I would have an organization of at least
twenty n*eu in each county, who should
have supervision of all lawlessness and
disorders In the county."
Mrs. H. F>lton, who produced a sensa
tion by her assertion at the agricultural
convention two years ago that - i ousand
negroes should be lynched every week un- !
til the outrages stopped, says she has no
reason to change her opinion.
Attorney General Terrill favors a better
enforcement of the laws. H<Â» says: "The
moans of enforcing our criminal laws
would be very materially Improved if a
system of county police were established
in every county In the State."
Hon. S. M. Inman, one of the wealthiest
citizens of Atlanta, thinks trouble could
1 â¢- averted if emp.ayers In the country
would investigate the character and the
antecedents of me people they employ.
Inspector General O'Bear: ! 'The Sheriff
of each county should organize a regular
posse of competent and determined men
who would be ready at :â  moment's notice
to respond to hi: 1 , ca.t. and in addition
thereto should maint-> - a pack of trained i
dngs to How the trail when a crime is
c mmltted in h s county. No expense or
eiTort should be spared to discover the
criminal and bring him to justice. Women
may assist In their own protection by be
coming miliar with the use of firearms
and having i.iem at hand when the occa
sion demands. It la not the duty of the
niilitia to hunt criminals, but to assist the
civil authorities in protecting them when
called upon."

but during the past ten days the fruit has
dropped disastrously. Irrigation In the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 25, 1899.
COGHLAN WILL
BE DISCIPLINED
First to Lose Command
of the Raleigh.
Frecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 24.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Before the Raleigh leaves
New York to-morrow for Philadelphia
Secretary Long is expected by well
informed officers to take action which
will relieve Captain Joseph B. Coghlan
of his command.
In any event, it is said by these offi
cers, that unless Captain Coghlan's
letter satisfactorily explains the indis
creet speeches made by that officer he
will not he aboard the vessel when the ;
President goes to Philadelphia to par
ticipate in the festivities there.
Secretary Hay having removed all
chance of friction with Germany In
consequence of Captain Coghlan's re
marks by a frank explanation, the only
thing that remains to be done to finally
close the incident is to carry out the
promise made to the Berlin Govern
ment to discipline the Raleigh's com
mander. This will be done immediate
ly upon the receipt of the explanation
which Captain Coghlan has been called
upon to make.
Secretary Hay promptly closed the
diplomatic end of the incident during
a talk he had with Embassador yon
Hollenben, who called at the depart
ment to express the regret of his Gov
ernment that an officer of the United
States navy should go so far as to
discuss the conduct of Germany in the
manner that Captain Coghlan had done
both in the speech before the Union
League Club and that delivered at the
Army and Navy Club banquet Satur
day night. I have authority for the
statement that the Secretary replied
practically in this manner:
The remarks of Captain Coghlan, as j
reported in the press, were indiscreet
and improper in their character. They
were said to have been uttered at a din
ner party given by a private citizen in |
a private room of a club, and cculd
therefore have no public character |
whatever. The Navy Department :
would take such disciplinary measures
as might seem proper.
The German Embassador was natur
ally much gratified at this prompt ex
planation of Secretary Hay, and ac
quainted his Government by cable,
with the result of his call. The em
bassy officials find it difficult to detach
Captain Coghlan from his position as
an oflicer of the United States navy,
and therefore they insist he should
be disciplined. The Embassador is
willing to wait, however, for the. Navy
Department to take action, feeling as
sured that it will be of such a character â¢
as to fully atone for the offense.
I understand the complaint of the
German Embassa<lÂ«.r has been brought
by Secretary Hay to the attention of ,
both the President and Secretary Long.
The latter called at the White House
to-day and talked the matter over with
the President, but so far as could be
subsequently learned there has been no
change in the programme which the
Secretary outlined on Saturday even- ,
ing.
Before taking action the Secretary
will await ih-- receipt of the correct* d
version of Captain Coghlan's speech
from that officer, with a statement in
explanation. He hopes that Captain <
Coghlan mailed his answer this even-
Ing, so that he can get it before the
Raleigh sails to-morrow.
Naval officers scout the idea that j
Admiral Dewey requested Captain
Coghlan to lay the facts regarding the
conduct of the Germans before the
American people, as they say he is too
good a disciplinarian to even entertain
the idea. Admiral Dewey is not con- j
cerned in the matter in any way, as
Captain Coghlan is not now under his!
command, and he will not be consulted j
as to the action which the department j
will take.
The Navy Department has no present
intention of court-martialing Captain
Coghlan and will confine its action to
relieving him of his command, should j
his explanation be unsatisfactory, and
writing him a letter of censure.
"AUFLUbS DER WINEFLAUNE"
SAY GERMAN OFFICIALS
BERLIN. April 24.â 1n official circles the
Coghlan Incident is regarded as an "auf
luss der wineflaune" (expression of wine
humor).
A representative of the Foreign Office
said to the correspondent here of the As
sociated Press:
"The American Government has prompt
ly and efficiently done all we could rea
sonably ask. This alone, even If it were
not for other indications, shows us that
the American Government is not in any
way identified with the utterances of a
solitary officer."
The Tageblatt, in an inspired article, re
calls the fact that the incident is a year
old (referring to the message which Ad
miral Dewey is said to have sent to Ad
miral yon Dledcrichs), and adds: "If we
must admit Admiral Dewey iirst harbored
suspicions of the German squadron, these
suspicions were subsequently removed and
thHr relations became most cordial, Ad
miral Dewey even decorating his ships
with flags on the Empress 1 birthday,
which International etiquette did not com
pel him to do. 1 '
The Lokal Anzeiger, In a somewhat vio
lent denunciation of Captain Coghlan,
says: "He comes of Irish-American line
age which notoriously produces the
roughs, both high and low, of the Amer
ican classes."
The Boersen Courier thinks it strange
th â  Americans recommence to seek a
quarrel with Germany instead of first con
quering the Filipinos, who promise to give
them enough work for some time to come.
COGHLAN HAS WOT
HEARD FROM WASHINGTON
NEW YORK. April 24.â Captain Oogh
lan was s<f en at the Waldorf Astoria to
night, and asked if he had received any
communication from the Navy Depart
ment concerning his recent speeches at
the Union League Club and at the Army
and Navy Club, he said:
"I have received no communication
whatever from the Navy Department
since my arrival at New York, except
sailing orders for the ship, directing me
to take her to Sandy Hook for inspec
tion, and ordering me to take the Ra
leigh to Philadelphia for the purpose of
participating in the dedication of the
Grant monument on Thursday next.
"If there is any intention to court
martial me or relieve me of my command
for what I have said at the two clubs I
have received no intimation whatever of
thp fact. It will be understood that f
occupy a delicate position just at present
and for that reason 1 have nothing to'
say about the interest which my speeches
seem to have made. I cannot discuss the
subject in any way."

some time, but the end was unexuected.
Governor Oglesby was born in Kentucky in 1824, and migrated to Illi

WILDE PROTESTS AGAINST
PROMOTION OF MILLER
WASHINGTON. April 21.-Captaln D.
F. Wilde, U. S. N., of the cruiser Boston
has protested against the promotion of-
Colonel Miller to be a brigadier general
as a reward for the capture of Iloilo. It
appears that this capture was effected
entirely by naval forces under the com
mand of Captain Wilde, and that it was
not until after the capture had been ef
fected that the place was turned over to
Colonel Miller, who up to that time had
nothing to do with the capture. This ac
tion is indorsed by Admiral Dewey.
Wilde's protest comes too late to be ef
fective, as Colonel Miller was promoted
brigadier general February 15, in recogni
tion of his services In the capture of Iloilo,
and was retired in that grade March 27
by operation of law on account of agi
He was in command of the expedition Bent
from Manila for the capture of Iloilo, and
the cruisers Boston ami Petrel wore sent
with him to render assistance. While t he
vessels of theÂ» xptdition were lying on" the
port the natives began to strengthen their
defenses and fired several shots at the Pe
trel, which vessel was anchored nearest
the shore. The commander of that same
warship asked and received permission of
Captain Wilde of the Boston to respond.
At this time, according to naval ad
vices, General Miller's army transports
were far out in the roadstead. Without
communicating with General Miller, the
two warships opened on the shore batter
ies and soon Bllenced them. Lieutenant
Nlblack "f the Boston landed with a bat
talion of marines and sailors and took
possession of the town. They captured
the insurgent flags on the Governor's
house and on the batteries and turned the
city over to General Miller on his arrival,
an hour or so later. They kept the cap
tured flags, however, in spite of General
Miller's demand for them. This is the
naval story of the battle of Iloilo.
The official report of that engagement
first received in Washington was one by
General Miller to the war Department
and siniply announced the surrender of
that city to the American forces under
his command, without going into partlcu
lars. Acting upon this report and in view
of the fact that Genera! Miller had but a
few more weeks to serve on the active
list, the President appointed him to a va
cancy Jhen existing in the list of briga
dier generals. He is now on his way
home from Manila and is expected to
reach San Francisco in a few days.
Y. M. I.'s Congratulations.

ment of the San \ Francisco Council,

RIGIDLY CROSS-EXAMINED
WILLOWS, April Blâ Expert Eisen
schimel, who testified for the defense In
the Murdock case, was cross-examined
to-day. When asked if he visited the of
fices of the defendants' attorneys prior to
the giving of his opinion to Cannon and
Freeman a year ago, he replied that he
had: Eisenschimel testified that if 2000
reputable residents of the county should
testify that they had seen the Murdock
note prior to IS9O. he would not believe
them, and would say they were either
mistaken or were untruthful. He denied
that, while the affidavit of Samuel Mur
dock was being introduced during the
opening of the case by the plaintiff and
before he saw it, he told Kytka to "get
a photograph of it and we will knock it
out."' Plaintiffs attorneys claim to be
able to impeach Eisenschimei. who wu
1, ft in a rather unhappy position when
the cross-examination closed.
The afternoon was consumed in a re
hash of Kytka's testimony. Kytka
probnbly will be on the stand most of to

REJECTED LOVER
TAKES HIS LIFE
Suicide of H. E. Petersen
at Salinas.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, April 24.â Another of those
sad casts wherein a young man des
perately in love -with a pretty maiden
of fickle disposition ends life rather
than be subjected to the taunts of the
gossiping public for having been jilted
culminated in this city this evening,
when H. K. Petersen shot himself in
the head with a revolver and died soon
afterward.
For a long time it has been known
that Peteraen, who was 28 years old,
has been attentive to Miss Bertha Mar
tin, a Watsonville young lady promi
nent in society circles of that city, and
they have lung been regarded as be
trc-thed. This love affair commenced
several years ago and up to only a few
months ago Petersen lived in the town
which was the home of his affianced.
He was employed by the Spreckels
Company, had a fine position, had ac
cumulated quite a little wealth and
was very devoted to Miss Martin.
Several months ago, so the story
goes, Petersen having been removed to
the office of the company near this city,
Miss Martin found another man who
suited her fancy, and as a result Peter
sen did not receive letters as frequently
as he wished. Last Saturday night he
and a companion drove over to Watson
ville to remain over Sunday with rela
tives. W. Wood, who accompanied
Petersen, says the young man seemed
very happy on the trip going over, but
on the return it was different. During
the drive to this city Petersen hinted
there had been a quarrel.
This afternoon at 5 o'clock the pro
prietor of the Spreckels Hotel heard the
report of a revolver in the room of
Petersen. He entered and found the
young man lying on the bed, the blood
streaming from a wound in his head.
A faint cry of "I did it for her," and
Petersen was dead. A note on the
table was found, signed by Peteraen
and addressed to his brother, stating
that he was tired of life.
GREAT BRITAIN'S ACTION
IS SOMEWHAT PECULIAR
While Abrogating the Clayton-Bul
wer Treaty, It Tries to Control
Nicaraguan Transporta
tion Lines.
NEW YORK, April 24.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: President
Iglesius of Costa Rica called at the State
Department this morning and conferred
with Secretary Hay. The Secretary has
impressed upon the Costa Ricans that the
Presideni does not deem it expedient, in
view of the act of Congress directing fur
ther investigation of the isthrniam canal
routes, to construct the Nicaragua canal.
Although Great Britain is willing: to re
linquish her rights to share in the Nica
raguan canal by abrogating the Clayton-
Bolwer treaty in return for a quid pro
quo from the United States, it is apparent
to tile officials of the State Department
that she is taking measures to provide
transportation facilities acroÃS Nicaragua
for her own trade.
No official confirmation has been re
ceived of the dispatch from Managua say
ing President Zelaya had granted an op
tion to the British Consul at Managua or
to any company he may organize to pur
chase the railroads and steamboats of
Nicaragua, with workshops appertaining
to them, for the sum of 6,500,000 pesos
(silver), but the details of the agreement
are expected by the State Department.
It is considered very significant that
the representative of Great Britain should
take measures for placing under British
control transportation facilities in Nica
ragua while negotiations are in progress
between the United States and Great
Britain for the abrogation of the Clayton-
Bulwer treaty and with it the surrender
of all the latter's rights in the Nicaragua
canal.

BIG FISH CAUGHT
IN FEDERAL NET
Prominent Counterfeit
ers in the Toils.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, April 24.â Former
United States District Attorney Ellery
P. Ingham of this city and Deputy
Internal Revenue Collector Samuel B.
Downey of Lancaster were arrested by
secret service officers to-day on the
charge of aiding the Lancaster coun
terfeiters in their efforts to flood the
country with bogus treasury notes and
internal revenue tobacco stamps. The
arrest of Ingham created a great sen
sation on account of his prominence
and his former connection with the
' Government as United States Attorney
for the eastern district of Pennsylva
nia. Those who are now under arrest
charged with complicity in the great
plot are: Ellery H. Ingham, ex-United
j States District Attorney, of this city;
, Henry K. Newitt, ex- Assistant United
; States District Attorney, of this city:
Samuel B. Downey, Deputy Internal
Revenue Collector of the Ninth Inter
ned Revenue District of Pennsylvania,
lof Lancaster, Pa. ; Williams Jacobs of
Lancaster, William F. Kendig of Lan
caster; Thomas Burns, Kendig's fore
man; Arthur Taylor, expert engraver.
of this city, and Baldwin S. Bredell,
expert engraver and mechanic, of this.
| city.
Ever since the conspiracy was un
j earthed last Thursday the air has been
thick with rumors of further arrests.
John E. Wilkie, chief of the secret
service division of the United States
Treasury, and United States District
Attorney James Beck, who is Ingham's
immediate successor, were in Lancas
ter yesterday, accompanied by Captain
W. J. Burns, of the secret service.
With the information gathered at
Lancaster, Mr. Beck early to-day ap
peared before United States Commis
sioner. Edmunds and swore out war
rants for the arrest of Ingham and
Downey. Chief Wilkie and Captain
Burns went to Lancaster this after
noon and arrested Downey, while Dep
uty United States Marshal Foster took
Ingham into custody at the latter^
law office. Mr. Ingham was not sur
prised.
The ex-District Attorney was imme
diately taken before Commissioner Ed
munds and formally charged with con
spiring with Harvey Newitt, his law
partner, "'to promise, offer and give"
the sum of $6000 in monthly payments
of $500 each to William J. McManus of
Philadelphia, a secret service officer,
who was working up the case against
the five men charged with counterfeit
ing revenue stamps and the $100 silver
certificates. Ingham waived a hearing
and was held in $10,000 bail for a fur
ther hearing on Thursday morning.
Newitt's hearing, which had been fixed
for to-morrow, was changed so that
i both men can be arraigned together.
i Joseph R. Grundy of Bristol, Pa.,
I Newitt's bondsman, went Ingham's
ball.
Ellery P. Ingham has been prominent
;as a Republican in State politics. He
; was appointed United States Attorney
I for the eastern district of Pennsylva
| nla by President Harrison, but was
succeeded at the end of his term by
James M. Beck, who received his ap
pointment from President Cleveland.
During the last few years Mr. Ingham
â  has been a prominent figure at State
' conventions, as an adherent of ex-Sen
, ator Quay.
Samuel B. Downey, the deputy reve
j nue collector, was in consultation with
; his attorneys at Lancaster when Cap
j tain Burns took him in custody. He
was unable to give the $10,000 bail fixed
by United States Commissioner Mont
gomery, and was brought to Philadel- j
phia and lodged in the County Jail.
The Secret Service officers say that
Downey received about $1000 from Ja
cobs and Kendig for furnishing them
with information regarding the move
ments of Government detectives.
When interviewed to-night Chief
Wilkie spoke guardedly as to the evi
dence he expects to produce against
the men arrested to-day. He said,
however, that Downey had practically
solicited bribes from the counterfeiters,
! having told Jacobs that he was in fln
i anclal trouble and asked him for ad
vice. Jacobs first loaned him $100, and
later paid him larger sums. Dowmy
promising to keep Jacobs informed as
to what the Government officials were
doing. â¢
In regard to the arrest of Ingham,

Jacobs and the rest of the gang wanted
to get inside information from the Se

and Newitt were formerly United
States attorneys and. knew much of the
inside workings of the Government.
Jacobs knew this and approached them
cautiously, but he finally got there. To

now. lam perfectly satisfied with the
result of our year's work. In results
it was the greatest capture ever made
by the Secret Service. Taylor and
Bredell had already put into circula

amount of $10,000, and Jacobs and Ken

boxes containing between 40,000,000

alone will amount to about $140,000.
CAPTAIN DREYFUS WILL
NEVER BE LIBERATED
LONDON. April 25.â David Christie
Murray publishes this morning the state
ment that he has learned from trust
worthy sources in Paris that the superior
council of war, including General de
Negxier, General Zurlinden. General Gio
vanninelli, General Duchcsne and Gen
oral Jemont, its vice president, none of
whom, except perhaps General Zurlinden.
has heretofore been implicated in the
Dreyfus affair, has decided that, under
no circumstances whatever, shall Dreyfus
be liberated.
He understands also, from the same
source, that negotiations are now pro
ceeding between the Intelligence Bureau
and the judges of the Court of Cassation
to secure a rejection of the request for
revision and that the judges who favor
revision are being subjected to terrible in
timidation. More than this, he learns
thnt everything has been arranged for a
sham trial of Colonel Ploquart, who ia to
be degraded and pentencÂ«d to imprison
ment for ten years.
PARIS, April 24.â The Figaro continues
its publication of the testimony offered
before the Court of Cassation in the Drey
fus revision inquiry. Captain Cuignet,
who described thr discovery of the forgery
of lieutenant Colonel Henry, told the
court that in his opinion Henry was only
an accomplice of Colonel Paty dv
Clam, the principal author of the for
gery, inasmuch as Heniy was never he
fore accused of wrong-doing, while
Paty dv Clam was known to be guilty of
shady practices.
According to Captain Cuiget, Paty
dv Clam had the dossier at the prefecture
of police.

DEMAND RECOGNITION
OF A MINERS' UNION
"WARNER, Idaho, . April 24.â Another
labor strike was started here last night
when the "Wardner Miners' Union de
manded that the Bunker Hill and Sulli
van Company, employing 360 men. ad
vance wages to $3 50 ail around and rec
ognize the union. The company is pay
ing $3 and $2 50 and has not recognized the
union, since the great strike of 1892. The
managers replied that they would never
recognize the union; that rather than do
so they would shut down the mine for
twenty years; but they are willing to ad
vance wages to $3 50 for miners and 13
for car men and shov lera.
The union, which has been working Its
men into the mine for a long time, claims
that 800 men came out on its call last
night. The company claims that it has
lost only 120.
A similar demand was made on the Em
pire State Idaho Company, formerly the
Last Chance. Charles Sweeney, one of the
owners, arrived to-day from Spokane and
ordered the mill and the mine closed. He
will discuss matters with the union to
morrow. There have been no disorders,
but many apprehend there will be.

IS THE WORK OF NATURE IN ITS CO!*-
struction of the complicated and delicate
mechanism of the human organism. Wonder-
ful in its endowment of health, strength, cour-
age, intellect, etc., to this organism. Won-
derful and peculiar in providing a means by
which the health and strength of this delicate
organism may be maintained.
THE GREAT HTJDYAN is nature's wonder-
ful and peculiar remedy, for if there is any
breaking-down of any of the delicate tissues
that go to make up the organism, HUDYAN
at once repairs the evil. HUDYAN gives
health. HUDYAN gives strength.
HUDYAN cures affections of the heart. Since
this most important organ is the hardest
worked one in the body, it very, very often
becomes diseased. Other diseases, that may
seem entirely remote from the Heart, are
directly due to lesion of this important organ.
Heart "Disease and Impaired Digestion are of-
ten associated.''' L." 3
Headache (Fig. 1). Coated Tongue . (Fig. 2),

Weight in Stomach (Fig. 6), Pain in Bide (Fig.
6), Pain In Back (Fig. 7). The above are the
symptoms. Other symptoms are Vertigo,
Dizzy Spells, Weakness, Easily Exhausted,
Swelling of Limbs.
Diagnose your own case, and when you have
done bo the remedy is at hand. HUDYAN
will cure you. It has cured thousands of men
and women; it will do so again. Be warned
in time, before the entire structure of the
Heart is destroyed.
If you notice that you are debilitated: that
your pulse is weak; that you have shortness
of breath, fainting or smothering spells, don't
wait one moment. You may yet be cured.
HUDYAN will cure you. There is rarely a
morning paper issued that does not tell of some
person being stricken down while apparently in
the best of health. We wish to say that
premonitory symptoms always exist, but often
they are attributed to other causes. Don't
make the mistake to overlook heart disease,
and mistake it for some trivial ailment which
you may think will wear off. This fatal error
occurs far too often. Be cured by HUDYA.N.
HUDYAN will cure all Stomach. Liver, Kid-
ney, Nervous and Blood Diseases as well.
HUDYAN' S curative influence reaches every
nerve and fiber of the human organism.

SALINAS, April 24.â The Grand Par
lor, Native Sons of the Golden West,
formally convened in this city at 10
o'clock this morning, and never in
the history of the organization did a j
Grand Parlor begin Its sessions under
more auspicious circumstances.; never did
delegates show more enthusiasm or re- j
spond with greater eagerness to the call
to order of a grant* president than to-day,
when Grand President William M. Conl< y
assumed the executive chair and the
travel of authority.
The city was awakened this morning
by the pound of falling raindrops and
opened its eyes to hold low, black
clouds, from which issued a steady down
pour of rain. It was thus that Jupiter
Pluvius and his "watering pot" took re
venue upon old Pol for having hustled
him out of the way yesterday. The rain
fell steadily till nearly & o'clock, and al
though it h.-ld up for a considerable pe
riod after that hour sudden showers were
the order all day. Of course the decora
tions were iked, many of them being
entirely spoiled. The blaze of yellow glory
of yesterday was so changed that the
city presented the appearance of a big
wet, bedraggled canary bird. Many of
the decorations were renewed during the
.lay, so that by evening the effect was
fully as attractive as before the wetting
i ame.
Nearly all the delegates came without
umbrellas and a lively time was had in
the shops where they were to be bought
The town's entire stock of umbrellas was
exhausted long before noon to-day and

The opening business session of the
â¢ Jrand Parlor occupied nearly all ujp
morning. The work was particularly
notable from the fact that the early his
tory of California, as made In and about
Monterey, the old capital city, its historic
Colton Hall and other buildings :..
prominently In the secret work of the
Native Sons' organization, and this being
the first time a Grand Parlor has ever
convened In Monterey County, these '
points were the more impressive. The
grand officers were all In th-ir places at
the first tap of Grand President Conley s
Bavel iind an unusually large number of |
delegates responded when the parlors .
were call* d.
Already the campaign for grand officers i
IB becoming very heated. Much rivalry. :
though of a friendly character, among the
different candidates is apparent, and each
man's fi lends are busily engaged in
championing hi? cause. As one of the
natives appropriately remarked, there are i
L |f measures allowed at this Grand
r and any delegate who is luke
warm In any respect in being put through
a vigorous warming-up process by those
whn want his support for their friends.
Judge W. M. Conley of Tosemtte Parlor,
Madera the present grand president, will
by virtue of liis office become junior past j
grand president, and. according to prece
dent Grand First Vice President Frank
Mattison of Santa Cruz Parlor will be
come | sident. The line of pro- j
mmion would, according to precedent.
bring Judge R. C. Rust of Excelsior Par
lor Jackson, Amador County, t,<> the '
grade of grand first vice president, and as
tne o f] md orator If the first step !
in the ladder to the grand pn
United States District Attorney F. U
Coombs of Napa Is likely to become grand j
.i vice president. Precedent may be'
disregarded, however, and the Salinas :
Grand Parlor may become notable for a
this time-honored custom.
Th< ' ' centers around the
m oi grand trustees, and it is here \
â  ...inns have full Bwing. There is
i |y a parlor hi the State that has ;
least one candidate for the office of
1 grand trustee, and as only seven are to
be elected a large number are apt to get
snowed under. Some of the more promi
nent aspirants for the grand trusteeships
are: Judge H. R. McNoble of Stockton
Parlor, Judge Fletcher A. Cutler of Hum
bold: Parlor of Woodland (incumbent),
W. D. Shea of California Parlor, San
1 Francisco; M. T. 1 looting of Fremont
Parlor. Hollister; Frank Sabichi of Ra
mona Parlor, Los Angeles; D. W. Edi :
; man of Corona Parlor. Los Angeles; C. E.
McLaughlin of. Quincy Parlor. Plumas
County; P. V. Long of Columbia Parlor,
San Francisco; Frank Barnett of Pied
mont Parlor, Oakland; Joseph E. O'Don
nel of Yerba Huena Parlor, San Fran
cisco; Charles O. Dunbar of Santa Rosa
Parlor; James A. Devoto of Alcalde Par
lor. San Francisco; and John A. Porcher
of Mission Parlor, San Francisco. Those
whose chances are regarded as the best
are: Cutler, McXoble. Dunbar, Sabichi,
McLaughlin, Long and Devoto.
The contestants for the office of grand
orator are Supervisor Lewis F. Byington
of Niantic Parlor and Joseph K. Haw
kins of Pacific Parlor, each at present
I fielding the office of grand trustee. The
I office of grand marshal will go to a mcm
i ber of the parlor In the city In which the
Admission day celebration will be held.
A. W. Fielder of Las Positas Parlor,
Livermore, grand outside sentinel, wants
to be advanced to grand inside sentinel.
Max Glass of Alameda Parlor would like
to be grand outside sentinel. John J. Mc-
Mahon of Mount Diablo Parlor, Mar
tinez, now grand inside sentinel, wants
I to be one of the seven grand trustees to
; be chosen.
The big fight of the' session is between
Byington and Hawkins for the office of
grand orator. Both men have many I
friends working for them and all other
j members of the Grand Parlor are watch
ing the contest with unusual Interest.
1 These elections all occur on the last day
of the session, and in the meantime all
the candidates and their friends can do
, is to vigorously "pull the wires."
After an early luncheon to-day the Na
tives, accompanied by the Fifth Regi
ment band of San Jose, boarded the
dummy line trains to visit Sprockets and
be shown over the great sugar factory.
At the entrance to the factory grounds
they were met by Superintendent W. C.
Waters and a corps of guides, and all
climbed about amid the ponderous ma
chinery from the ground floor to the top
iof the enormous building. Everything
was interesting, not only because of the
'â  size of the plant and the monetary outlay
represented, but because of the beauty of
1 the machinery and the skill of the me
chanics who constructed so vast and
complicated a plant. The building and
its equipments are yet incompleted, and
those among the Natives who under
stand machinery were diverted by watch
ing the small army of workmen em
ployed about the place. Each visitor was
handed a card with the following sta
tistics printed on It as a souvenir of the
afternoon:
The *reat factory will cost about $2,500,000.

demands of the factory. Salinas Valley af
fords 90,000 acrea for beet cultivation.
Prom the top of the building the visi
tors viewed the town of Spr<ekels and
the outlying ten-acre bert ranches, and
were greatly interested to the success of
the colonization scheme Inaugurated by
Mr. Spreckels. Two of the notable elimb
era t<> the '"p of the factory were C. w.
Clough of the Balinas Democrat and
Grand Treasurer Henry Martin, the fat
man of this. Grand Parlor. dough
weighs 3G9 pounds, outweighing Martin by
sixteen pounds, and is six feel two and a
half Inches tall. Martin goes ahead of
Clough in extent of girth, however, by
nine Inches. The Salinas man is well
built and muscular and is an all-around
athlete of considerable skill. Some lively
"joshing" at the expense of these two
heavy- weights was indulged In i>y the Na
tives who saw them together." Martin,
who has held the palm for bigness at the
(â rand Parlors sm long, lias at last met
!i!s betterâ or biggerâ and feels greatly
aggrieved at the appearane.fi of Editor
Clough in the ranks of the delegates,
Descending from the main building, the
Natives visited the immense boiler plant
and the adjacent mar-hine shops and en
gine bouse, and crossing the trestle to the
elevator returned t" the town of Spreck
els, where they inspected the hotel and
cottages. Altogether the visit was one not
soon to be forgotten.
A short concert was given on Main
street by the Salinas band when the Na
tives returned to town, after which the
Grand Parlor assembled in the second
session of the day. It has seemed that
the appearance to-day of either of th'
three official bands has been tlu signal
f^r a heavy downpour of rain and the
city and her guests enjoyed their music
under difficulties.

posed the young man became overcome
by the gases and fell head foremost into
the pit beneath the tanks, his head strik
ing on the timbers. His neck was broken.

A CARDINAL
IN CURIA MAY
BE CHOSEN
New Catholic Official Likely
to Represent the United
States.
ROME HIS RESIDENCE
Archbishop Keane Has Great Popu
larity at the Vatican and Is
Mentioned for Elevation.
t
Special Dispatch to The <'ai!.
NEW FORK, April 24.â Private ad
vices from Rome Indicate the proba
bility of important changes in the of
ficial relations of the Catholic church
here with the Vatican. A Cardinal in
curia to represent the United States
may be appointed.
Mgr. Martinelli is mentioned as the
coming nuncio to Paris.
A Cardinal from South America is
considered a certainty.
Cardinals in curia are prelates who
form the in .ediate entourage of the
Pope's administration. They are in
vested with such authority as enables
them to be heard directly on affairs of
the nations th represent. These
Cardinals always reside in Rome.
They are important functionaries in
the diplomatic intercourse of the Vat
ican. European powers are very jeal
ous and eager about their selection.
Of course, as the United States has
no official political connection with the
Vatican, similar relations could not be
established for the American republic,
but it is said the authorities in Wash
ington have been indirectly approached
in the matter. Churchmen who will
talk about the subject hint that when
Archbishop Ireland and Archbishop
Keane return here something more
denufto will be available on this point.
Archbishop Keane returns to take up
the work of collecting indorsements for
the Catholic University at Washington,
of which he was the first rector. His
name, of course, is mentioned in con- '
nection with the nomination of Cardi- <
nal in curia. His great popularity in |
Rome among Vatican officials would
make his elevation acceptable. What
opposition might be made on this side)
of tho Atlantic will have to be devel- I
oped lat^r. If his personal wishes are '
consulted, the Archbishop, his intimate j
friends say, would rather stay on this I
sid< of the ocean, but he is so valuable i
an adjunct to the Papal court that j
while the present Pope lives he will !
probably be kept abroad.
To several of the Cardinals who are i
mentioned as likely to succeed Leu I
XIII he is even more acceptable, and j
I added honors are sure to follow the I
elevation of either of them to the Papal ;
throne. The nomination may also be ,
hastened by a change in the Apostolic
delegation at Washington.
The recent death of the nuncio to
Paris leaves a vacancy at that impor
tant post. It is current gossip that
Mgr. Martinelli may be transferred
from Washington to Paris as nuncio, \
thus receiving a reward for his work j
here and prefacing his early elevation
to the sacred college, in which his
brother, the late Cardinal Thomas |
Martinelli, was long one of the Pope's j
most active and helpful friends. Such j
a change would necessitate a readjust- !
ment of the official machinery of the !
church all along the line. The coming
consistory will have an important
bearing on the whole subject.

of one dark night
on the skirmish line
during the war. When on the instant that
his musket was aimed to kill a Union pick-
et the latter, suddenly inspired with a
sense of his own defenceless condition,
began to sing those beautiful words: " Cov-

Death sometimes spares the one who

Many a man who seemed picked out for
death by consumption has found respite
and safety through the use of that wonder-

Dr. R. V. Pierce, of Buffalo, N. V., invented
thirty years ago, and which has brought
new life and hope to almost countless
thousands of men and women.

medicines and his advice have done to
restore health and happiness to homes

reigned supreme.
A gentleman living in Stillwater, Washington

" In the spring of 1884, I was taken ill with
consumption, and after trying everything I

MERCHANTS WANTED TO
BANQUET HUNTINGTON
Herrin's Scheme to Diversify the
Programme at the Annual
Railroad Banquet
Subordinates May Extol the Chief, but Must Not in
the Future Shower Each Other With Praise.
Merchants Fail to Respond.
WF. HERRIN has conceived
the happy notion of present
ing his patron, < '. P. Hunt-
I ington, Bomething original
in the form <<f an annual
hanquet. At certain seasons of the
year the chief of the Southern Pacific
law department is vivacious as well as
itile. li is only In the higher
sph re i i" politics that he is uniformly
dull ami stupid.
His latest scheme to impress, enlight
en an'i gratify the president of the
Southern Pacific is to diversify the an
nual bang by the sub..'..:
railroaders by the Introduction of re
sponses from merchants and business
men of .^a:i Fra Hitherto it has
been the custom for the employes of
the corporation to make all th..'
hea Herrin favored expansion.
He proposed to take In the merchants
and bankers to eulogize Mr. Hunting
ton.
Perhaps Huntington had grown
weary of railroad flattery and desired
diversion. He must groan in spirit
when he recalls the pasi gatherings at
inquet board. No doubt he recol
g things at the
annual dinner. It is the custom, as all
know, tor W. n. Mills to leadoutamong
the first in praise of his chief as a boss,
and sliphtly diminished praise of Vice
President Stubbs as a traffic manager.
Then Mr. Stubbs follows with a eulogy
of Huntington and a glowing tribute
to the literary and land selling accom
plishments of V.
The law department comes to the
front with boui the old man,"
a pansy for the freight office and a
daisy for literary Mills. Last of all,
and la - the operating
rtments represented by "Fatty"
Fillm ster or Richardson, with a
choice lot of eulogies for the head of
department and a load of compli
ments for Herrin as a lawyer, for
Ptubbs as a freight trafficker and for
Mills as an orator. To break the mo
ny "f railroad push. General
Barn< lly brought forth to

era!. Joe Redding is specially lntro
ik an intellectual lance
with the land department for the edifi
â  n of his chief. When the s< I w-"
--pramme is finished all arise and sing
in chorus the i C. I. Huming
ton.
There has been bo little diversity in
the exen ises >>f the annual banquet
that the underlings who subscribe for
the feast at-" "kicking." In order,
therefore, to appease them and satisfy
"the head of the corporation," Herrin
Is wnrkins his brain for all "the traffic
will bear" < I some novelties.
Festerday he completed and unfolded
his plans expanded entertain
ment. In the first place, the plans con

Grand Opera-House
ThÂ« Southwell Opera Company Is at Its
template that solid and respectable ;
merchants of San Francisco shall be \
the chief talkers. When the health of
C. I. Huntington is proposed the re
spected merchant, according to the
programme, will arise, adjust hi.s vest
and strike an attitude of veneration.
He will refer to the promoters and
builders of the Central Pacific in a gen
eral way, but reserve the special fund
of praise for Huntington. Of course,
he must be careful not to "slop over"
in the presence of the young Crockeis.
who still retain a memory of their
father's achievements as a railroad
builder.
The respected merchant will tell how
gallantly Mr. Huntington suppr< ssed
the Mussel Slough rebellion and ex
pelled from a fertile region of Cali
fornia all the settlers who were not
In defending their homes. Kefer
svUl he made, with delicate shad
ing, to the blending of railroad busi
ness and politics during the period that
Governor Stanford was president of
the company, and then the great re
form wrought by Huntington in di
vorcing the road from politics will be
alluded to. This reference, according
to the programme, will elicit eh
but the youngsters in the Bervice of the
company will blush for Herrin while
they cheer for Huntington.
When the programme was unfolded
in the yellow building all praised its
originality and none questioned its
ity, but when Herrin sallied forth
to find the merchants to praise his
master he found many willing to feed,
but none read to Hatter. The day
which opened so bright and promising
Herrin closed in gloom. All the
merchants of Front. Market and Bat
tery streets were shy. None wanted to
talk at the banquet.
To-day Vice President Stubbs may
try his eloquence on some of the big
shippers to induce them to come and
â  Ktol Huntington for his public spirit
in reducing tariffs on freight. If the
new scheme, conceived by Herrin, ut
terly fails in practical operation, the
railroad banqueters will "be compelled
to fall back on the original crowd of
after-dinner orators. In that event
Douty, Sproule and the new passenger
agent. McCormick, may be i
to service to introduce something new
in the lexicon of praise. The banquet
will take place as usual, and Mr. Hunt-
Ington will be there.
The story goes that George < 'rocker
has taken alarm at the prospect and
has arranged his affairs to l^ave San
Francisco for New York before the
banquet begins.
Late last night it was decided at the
yellow building that something unique
and edifying should lie presented. If
no merchant can be found to extol the
president of the corporation one must
he brought in. by force, if necessary, to
make a speech in the presence of the
magnate, and to assert in that speech
that W. F. Herrin of the law depart
ment made a superb fight in the legis
lature to elect Dan Burns United States
Senator. It was resolved, whether or
not a merchant can be persuaded to
speak, that Manager Fillmore should
nd to the toast. "Why 1 Was Not

GAS RATES IRE
FIXED FIRMLY
FOR ONE YEAR
$1.10 Is All Company
Can Charge.
SUPERVISORS' ACTION FINAL
THE BOARD NOW HAS NO POWER
TO RECONSIDER.
Issue Lies Between the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company and
the Consumers of the
Product.
Â»#<?>*<Â«>*<?>*-â¢ * Â£*â¦ * <SÂ»*<S>*<?>*.3>Â«-s>#<s
According to the ruling of
competent authority the rate
of $1 10 per thousand cubic
feet for gas must stand for one
year. It replaces the former
rate of $1 75 which house
holders have been paying for
years. Mayor Phelan held at
a meeting of the Board of
Supervisors yesterday that the
matter of fixing a rate was no
longer before the board, its
action in naming a rate of
$1 10 being final and not sub
ject to revision. Hence the
bills presented to consumers
for the month of April should
be at the reduced rate.
The issue as to the rate which house- |
holders In this city shall pay for Kas for
the next year now lies between the con-!
sinners and the company. The Super- ',
visors have apparently accepted the dic
tum of Mayor Phelan. that once having
fixed a rate, the law does not countenance
their changing their action for the period !
of one year. ,
The rate fixed by the board a fortnight;
was $1 in per thousand cubic i â¢â .â¢l.
This replaces the rate of $175, which has
been charged for years. It now remains j
for :> consumer to refuse to pay any bill
rendered In which he is charged more
than $1 '." per thousand feet. It has been
intimated by the attorneys for the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company that .
they will resort to the courts before ac
cepting this rate, <>n tin- ground that it ,
does not give them a reasonable return
Invested. The low rate
was originally named in jest, the minority
members â â :' the board righting fur Ji 35, or
at thr outside Si 50. The company was
willing " : voluntarily a reduction
from $1 7." tv $1 >''>'. but would not entertain
anj proposal below that.
It was expected the matter nf fixing a .
rate would iÂ»- .main discussed yesterday.
Bishop and Xix, accompanied .
by a stenographer, were present to take
part, if necessary, in any discussion
might develop. It was nearly 7
k in the evening before the busi
ness .'i' the board was completed. As the ,
members were about to adjourn, Super- i
visor Perrault said:
"I thought the gas question was com
ing up for further consideration to-day!"
"I guess that is all settled." said his
â  the Mayor, and there was no one j
to take issue with him.
The matter is "'up to the rate pay
ers now" for them to determine what .
shall pay for illuminating fluid for
I ensuing twelve months.

GOVERNOR GAGE UNDER
THE RAILROAD YOKE
His Conference With W. F. Herrin
Creates Commotion at
the Palace.
Friends of the Cbief Executive Advised to Instruct
Him in the Duties and Responsibilities of
His High Office in the State.
THE flying visit of Governor Gage
to San Francisco has occasioned
â widespread comment in this
city. Men of affairs were as
tounded that the chief executive
of the State would so far forget the
dignity of his office, and whatever self
i respect he may possess, as willingly
; and brazenly to submit himself pub
; licly to the domination of an influence
[ that is notorious in its corruption
iof public men. When Governor
! Gape, hurriedly and secretly, en
| tered the Palace Hotel on Sunday af
i ternoon to meet William F. Herrin of
the Southern Pacific Company it was
impossible to misconstrue the purpose
of the Governor's mission.
William F. Herrin occupies no official
station in California. He is not auali
' fied either by authority or association
to be an adviser of the chief executive
of California. The chief of the law de
partment of the Southern Pacific Com
pany is hired by a powerful corpora
tion to manipulate public affairs and
influence public men. His advice is
sought by public men in secret and by
stealth, and Governor Gape stands ar
raigned as the first Governor of Cali
fornia who has flown in the face r.f
decent public opinion and prostrai >d
himself before the representative and
agent of a corporation whose name is
a synonym for evil.
It is the boast of Governor Gape that
before he was elected Governt/r of Cali
fornia he never held public office. He
may be ignorant therefore of the policy
of public men. He should learn that a
-nor (if California does not tran-
Bact public business as a hunted fugi
tive. He should know that associated
with his high office is a dignity and a
responsibility to the people which his
predecessors have honored and ob
served. His friends should inform him
that a Governor of California who has
putation to lose does not take a
gambling blackleg for a dictator and a
railroad employe for a counselor.
Governor c,;ige should be told that
the Chief Executive of this State does
not welcome aa a guard of honor in a
public hotel a horde of gamblers,
thieves, political roustabouts and ras-
I;. Governors of California have not
n in the habit of having such men
their train. They do not slip by
ilth into a public place to confer
NEW CITY TRUSTEES
TAKE THEIR OFFICE
FORDERER FORCED TO YIELD
THE GAVEL TO BRICK.
The Trustees Promise to Try and
Conduct the City Affairs Within
the Dollar Limit.
AX.AMEDA, April 24.â The new Hoard
of City Trustees took office this evening.
Joseph Forderer, who >ias been chairman
for the past six years, was forced to re
tire and was succeeded by John G. Brick.
George H. Miller nominated Brick and in.
doing so said:
"1 am sorry that Mr. Forderer cannot
be continued as chairman. The vote by
which he was returned to this board
shows that the people approve his course,
but political changes make it necessary
to place a new man in the chair, and I
hope he will get the unanimous vote of
the members and save him the humilia
tion of being forced to vote for him
self."
Mr. Forderer seconded the nomination
of Mx. Brick. He said:
"I was told by the opposition that it
was an absolute political necessity for me
to step down and out and that none of
the reform measures promised by the
party in control could be carried nut with
me in the chair. I am n<>t an obstruc
tionist and proposes to give the other fel
lows fvil! swing."
Mr. Crick stated that no one would he
discharged from the city's employ who
did his duty. No changes were contem
plated, be said, except in the electric
fight department, which is to be conduct
ed "M more economical plans. The new
Trustees will try to conduct the city af
fairs within the dollar limit. Mr. Brick
appointed the following committees:
Judiciaryâ Brick. Mackie.
Auditing and Financeâ Mackie. Sehulte.
Lights, Water, Printing and Advertis
ingâ Sehulte, Mackie.
Fire, Police and Public BuildingsâFor
derer, Miller.

of the maiority and minority on the Bame
committees. The old Board of Health was
reappolnted.

with men whose counsel the people
condemn. They have not acted as if
they feared the law rather than con
tributed to its creation. When they
have come to this city they have come
clothed with the dignity of their office.
They have signed their names upon ho
tel registers and have not winked a
clerk Into secrecy concerning their
presence.
They have secured, where they stop
ped, a local habitation and a name, and
have not sneaked to a secret rendez
vous for a secret conference upon af
fairs of public moment. When they ate
they have not swelled themselves with
1 pompous importance and conceived the
thought that their digestion was a
secret process of state to be set in
operation through the medium of a
hotel speaking-tube.
They have not shamelessly sought
the personal and direct dictation of
men who are known to ill-fame be
cause they buy public officers. Gov
j ernors of California have not, when
they contemplated the appointment of
United States Senators, sought the
counsel of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. Nor have Governors of Califor-
I nia who preceded Governor Gage slunk
â  from a hotel by a secret stairway to
j avoid the detection of an act that
merited public condemnation. Gov
ernor Ga?e has said that his adminis
tration will speak for itself. He for
j got to say what words would be spok
en. They may be an appeal to high
heaven before Governor Gage is rele
gated to private life.
The Governor's visit to the city and
j his conference with William F. Herrin
â¢ raised a commotion at the Palace Ho
tel. Governor Gage went to Herrin to
! be instructed in reference to the Sena
\ t-.rial situation. The instructions were
given and Gage received full confirma
tion of his understanding that the
Southern Pacific Company, through
him, will appoint D. M. Burns United
States Senator at the proper time.
Gage has neither made the appoint
ment nor has he said so. The people
of California understand what he will
do when the time comes. He will do as
he did on Sunday, permit himself to be
submitted to the indignity of an asso
ciation that condemns him, dishonors
the high station he occupies and sub
jects the State to the contempt and de
rision of the nation.

A rattling good baseball game was
played last Saturday at Santa Clara be
tween the nine representing the State
Normal School and the Santa Clara ('ol
lege team. The Santa Clara boys upheld
their reputation as champion athletes and
handsomely defeated their opponents by a
score of 5 to 1.
The Normal School boys are not satis
fled with their defeat, and it is expected
that a return match will Boon be played
on the old grounds. The Santa Clara
baseball team Is regarded by the players
of the country as being the strongest
amateur nine in the State.
CALLED TO ST. LUKES.
Rev. D. C. Garrett of Portland Will

It is more than probable that the Rev.
D. C. Garrett of Trinity Episcopal
Church, Oregon, may be the next pastor
of St. l.nkg's Church in this city. He
preached hero twice on Sunday and made
a most favorable impression. He is a fine
orator ;m<l possesses a magnetic deliv
ery. At a meeting of the vestry of St.
Luke's, held yesterday in the office of A.
N Drown. 104 Sutter street. Rev. Mr. Gar
rett appeared and discussed the advisa
bility- of his accepting the call. He in
formed the vestry that he would advise
them as to his decision. He left last night
for his home in Portland. This Is the
second time that he has been called to
this city.
RECOVERED HER PIN.
' Mrs. Rose Finds Her Diamond Cres
cent Which She Lost.
Mrs. George Rose, wife of the hook
makpr, recently lost a diamond crescent,
: which she valued at $500. She offered a
i reward of $100 for the recovery of the lost
' grem. Several days ago a man named
I Hirsch, who conducts a dry goods store
at 221 Montgomery avenue, visited her
house and offered to return the crescent if
she gave him $150.
Mrs. Rose visited police headquarters
and informed Captain Bohen of the
demand made by Hirsch. She explained
that she was willing to give him the
amount offered, but refused to pay the
exorbitant demand of Hirsch.
Captain Bohen Instructed Mrs. Rose to
visit Hirsch's store and ask to be allowed
to see the pin. He showed it to Mrs.
Rose, who, acting under instructions from
! Detectives Dinap and Tom Gibson, who
; were standing on the opposite side of the
; street. Bhe took it tn her hand, and un
i der th^ pretense that the light was dim in
the store, stepped outside.
Just as she did the detectives stepped
up to her and took possession of the pin.
Hirsch showed a disposition to resent the
Interference of the detectives, but finally
consented to allow the crescent to be
placed in the hands of the property clerk
of the Police Department until the matter
is adjusted In the Police Court.
Hirsch claims be bought the pin from
a man named Eckstein for $40. The latter
claimed he had found it on Larkin street,
near Sutter.

DIFFICULTY

Commission Will Supersede Existing
Government of the Islands and
Has Power to Modify
Berlin Treaty.
The members of the Samoan High Com
mission arrived in this city last night
from Washington and took quarters at
the Palace. The commission consists of
Bartlett Tripp of Yankton, S. D., the
American representative, E. Elliott, the
British member, and Baron Sternburg,
â who will look after Germany's interests.
They will proceed to Samoa on the trans
port Badger, which sails to-morrow. Each
CommiHsioner carries the individual in
structions of his Government, and last
night Mr. Tripp summed them up sub
stantially as follows:
The commission is given full authority
to carry on a provisional government for
Samoa. This Government may be stable
or temporary, as the conditions may war
rant. It is provided that the duties of all
those exercising authority in Samoa,
either under the treaty of Berlin or in
the service of either of the Governments,
Fhail be suspended in order that the High
Commission may direct the affairs of the
islands undisturbed. In doing this the
Instructions carefully prescribe the pres
ervation of order and the security of life
and property.
The commission will make a report upon
the recent collisions and the causes lead-
In?? up to them: the administration of the
islands, the rights of the several claim
ants to the kingship and also as to what
changes arc desirable in the methods pro
vided by the treaty of Berlin. The final
Bgrcr m<nt calls for unanimity of action,
which is to be conclusive, except when
it suspends a provision of the treaty of
Berlin. In that case a provision of the
treaty may be suspended by unanimous
agreement of the members, but the sus
pension is not final until the three Gov
ernments approve or disapprove.
Mr. Tripp has been Judge of the Su
preme Court of South Dakota, was Min
ister to Austria under President Cleve
land and is an experienced diplomat.
Baron Bternburg has been first secretary
of the German embassy, and .Mr. Elliot
was second secretary of the English em
bassy to lie United States. Both gentle
men have also been connected with Ori
ental legations and are likewise well
versed in the art of diplomacy.
In speaking of the affair, Judge Tripp
said:
"It is our desire to avoid International
complications in the settlement of the
problem. The three members are in strict
accord on the main issues. We realize
that It is a delicate question, for," he
added significantly, "grave consequences
have ensued for a smaller cause than the
one at issue."
Closed the Alhambra.
Edmund J. Holden has sued his asso-

MUDDY GOING AT OAKLAND
MARY BLACK BEATEN IN A SEN
Â« SATIONAL FINISH.
Rosinante Came From the Clouds and
â Satsuma in Bare Fettle.
Amasa Beaten by Harry
Thoburn.
Golden Rule, the enterprising son of
Imp. Golden Garter and Lucille Murphy,
added the Candelaria handicap to his
string of victories at Oakland yesterday.
;An indifferent field of low class two
year-olds opposed him, and he handled
his 127 pounds over the five-furlong run
without effort. Bathos alone was con
ceded a chance to beat the favorite, but
Ferguson gave the Daly youngster the
Klondike face at the start, and the
ground thus lost never made him trouble
! some. The muddy going gave Golden
; Rule no trouble, for he won as he wished
in 1:06. Bathos led Racetto out two
j lengths for the place.
Showery weather and the difficulty of
j picking winners over a muddy course kept
many away from the track. Favorites
about held their own by winning three \
events.
The most sensational event of the after
noon was the mile and a furlong run, for
which Mary Black ruled a decided favor
ite. Shouldering John ReifC and 101
pounds she started off at a heart-break
ing pace, actually losing her field the first
mile, which was reeled off in 1:42%. It
was too warm, for the mare began Stop
! ping the last part, and Rosinante, with
! Jenkins in the saddle, dropped from the
I clouds, winning by a neck.
Harry Thoburn's well-known iiking for
slushy going sent him to the post a slight
favorite over Amasa and Sly for the open
ing sprint. Basslnger had the leg up, and
trailing Amasa into the stretch, passed
the latter at the paddock, winning ridden
out by a couple of lengths. Sly finished
a close third.
Bald-faced Satsuma came out fresh and
frisky as a two-year-old, taking the nolle
purse run in a common canter. A pro
nounced favorite in the betting ring.
Rosormonde led him to the stretch, where
Dr. Rowel's horse took the lead, and it
was all over. Lost Girl managed to get
the show from San Venado.
A poor start ruined the chances of
Plan, the 7 to 10 favorite for the mile and
a sixteenth selling number. After get
. ting away poorly, Ruiz persevered with
; the gelding, but was late in getting up,
and met defeat by a head from Widow
Jones, which led from the jump.
Wyoming went to the post first choice i
! for the seven-furlong event, which closed
the day's racing, but was beaten in hol
low fashion by Imperious, the second
choice.

"Before I purchased your Belt I was nothing but a wreck, without any energy a
J or life whatever. To-day I am as strong as any man and can do as much work as v
Sthe next. My mind is clear as glass, my step quickened and feel better than I have Q
for years," writes F. J. MAKTINKTTI, Nevada City. Cal. Q
13 "I was for years a sad wreck before using your Belt. I suffered so with Vari- *r j
n '"'le, rheumatism, insomnia and other trouble? that I was on the verge of col- O
J lapse. Now, since using your Belt, all my troubles have disappeared and I feel a
U twenty years younger, and look It. The Belt has removed every sign of the weak- **
_ ness. JAS. MACCA.SKIE, 563 Mission street, San Francisco, Cal." Â©
"I had been troubled with Constipation and Indigestion for over thirty years Q

_ can truthfully say that I have received a permanent cure. I had tried all kinds of O
J remedies before commencing the use of the Belt, and therefore appreciate its great Â«

I weighed 14S pounds; now I weigh 175. and am gaining every day. I can now do Q

ThjE CARTOON AS (\ MORfIL WEAPON.
IZ^OR the anti-cartoon law which has now gone
into effect the press of the State almost uni
versally holds The Call responsible. A car
toon, "Johnson, the penman," published in this paper
during the session of the Legislature is said to have
been the spur which made the galled jade of official
corruption wince and buck to the extent of enacting
the law.
1: this be true. The Call has no regrets for its
course; no apologies to offer. On the contrary, it
cites that very fact as a convincing evidence of the
usefulness of the cartoon to the press and to the pub
lic, a proof of its effectiveness as a moral weapon, a
demonstration of its potency to so hold the mirror
up to rascality and folly that the guilty offender
biushes at his depravity and "weeps to find it fame."
For years the ablest writers and the ablest orators
of California have employed every weapon of argu
ment, reason, satire and invective to pierce the thick
hide of Johnson's self-conceit and shameless audac
ity, to expose his true nature so clearly that not only
would it be plain to all the world, but that even he,
!;iind as he is in his besotted egotism, might see him
self as others see him and realize his moral degrada
tion.
All these efforts of tongue and pen were vain. It
was in vain the eloquent Edgerton, that master of
an oratory whose invective burned and flamed like
tire, assailed the impudence of Johnson; it was in
vain McClatchy of the Bee, one of the most virile
and vitriolic writers who ever essayed to drive cor
ruption from politics, opposed his pretensions and
exposed his record. In vain many another orator
and many another writer tried each in turn to make
him feel in his heart the -sting of public scorn. Ail
words of tongue and pen were vain; they were futile;
they had no effect.
Then The Call published its cartoon. Grove John
son was pictured visibly so that the eye could see
him as he is. With that pictured page before them
the people saw what his record is and what he is.
lie himself saw himself, and knew at last how the
people sec him. and the hide of his egotism was
pierred, his very impudence was shamed into re
morse; he broke down and wept.
An intelligent public can demand no stronger or
more convincing proof of the effectiveness of the"
cartoon as a moral weapon. The pencil of the skilled
artist succeeds where all words fail. It carries con
viction not only to the public, but to the mind of
rascality itself. It is the most potent means which
virtue has to expose vice, folly, fraud and hypocrisy
and make their hideousness so clear that even those
who practice them shrink from them in dismay.
A free press charged with the duty of exposing
evil and driving from high places all who practice
it cannot surrendar this effective weapon at the com- |
mand of malicious rascality. The anti-cartoon law
enacted in a moment of fright and malice is uncon
stitutional. It is a violation of the fundamental
rights of the press. The Call will continue in the
future as in the past to cartoon vicious men, fools in
high office, boodlers, criminals, betrayers of public
trust, corrupt legislators, and, in, short, all kinds and
sorts of rascals who by trickery and knavery have
attained power or position in the State. It has
proven the potent sharpness of the cartoon as a
moral weapon and will not lay it down so long as
there is a battle to be fought for virtue and honesty
in California.
The San Francisco Chronicle has added new laurels
tc the many it has won for its aggressive defense of
what is right and its uncompromising defiance of
,_. . .... f
what is wrong. The brilliant stand taken yesterday j
by the Chronicle against the injustice of the anti
cartoon law merits commendation. The Chronicle
has deserved many a meed of praise for its eloquent
fashes of silence.
Emperor William of Germany is getting into all
sorts of trouble. Italy threatens to form an alliance
with France, desert the Triple Alliance and leave Ger
many facing the jaws of the English lion. And Em
peror William wanted to pick a quarrel with Uncle
Sam.
*The season has arrived when the chief ambition of
ship captains along the coast seems to be to take their
vessels overland. The collision of the Glenogle and
City of Kingston off Browns Point is the initial per
formance in that line this season.
WHAT IS TREASON?
AMERICANS have a profound respect for their
Government as created and supported by them.
This generates in the feeling that if the prin
ciples of the constitution are enforced the Govern
ment compels respect for the popular rights which are
secured by law.
The anti-imperialist sentiment of the country has
its origin in this regard of the people for the prin
ciples of their Government, and their fear that those
principles may Sustain a deathly shock by the exer
cise of powers beyond our continental borders which
the constitution docs not permit to the Government
within those borders.
When a major general in the United States army
said last January that it makes no difference if im
perialism is a violation of the constitution, for the
republic has outgrown that instrument and it is no
longer worth discussing, he was not rebuked by the
Government, nor was his destructive utterance dis
avowed by imperialists. Others, prominent in civil
life, have entered upon a regular campaign, as they
declare, to teach the people the absurdity of the
Declaration of Independence and the nonsense of the
statement therein that Governments derive their just
powers from the consent of the governed.
The course followed on these two lines has seemed
to a large number of thoughtful people as leading to
the destruction of our insiitutions.
The effect of the policy it is intended to justify has
developed quite rapidly. Within ten day. an impe-ial
i ist organ in this city has declared that we must pro-
I ccc : without mercy to the suhdtiing of the rebellion
S of "our subjects" in the Philippines, and the term
"subjects" hi this country in the same connection has
appeared twice since in news dispatches in which the
matter has been discussed.
There are men and patriots in the country who be
lieve that "subjects" and "citizens" cannot long exist
under a Government which derives all of its powers,
| and all of its sovereignty, and all of its jurisdiction
â¢ from the constitution. They believe that the tendency
of events will be to make all men under that sover
eignty "subjects" or Filipinos "citizens," and they re
gard either as disastrous to our institutions.
In order to discredit these sentiments, which a year
ago were universally held by the American people, it
has become necessary to stamp them as treason to the
Government, and this is being done by charging the
anti-imperialists with sending dispatches to troops in
the Philippines, advising against their re-enlistment in
the hard service in which they have borne themselves
so gallantly for the last two months. It is probably true
that parents of volunteers whose enlistment has ex
pired have exhorted them to come home, but it is
probably untrue that other parties, not in the pa
rental relation to volunteers nor moved by domestic
affection, have used the cable or the mail for any such
purpose. The last form of the story that cablegrams
have been sent signed "committee" is still less prob
able, for any one with intelligence and resources
enough to semi lengthy cablegrams knows that the
cable to the Philippines i.> in possession of our mili
tary authorities and that such dispatches \s<-uld never
reach the men in the camps or the field. The state
ment has been propagated that these dispatches have
changed the spirit of the volunteers and that they no
longer desire to re-enlist, and at the same time it is
.red that the dispatches were seized and held by
the military authorities. The two statements are in
consistent and destroy each other.
The censorship at Manila is unleakably strict, and
even as public news nothing passes that is not agree
able to the military censor.
As far as developed, the anti-imperial sentiment i-i
this country is unaffected by war or peace in the Phil
ippines. The complete pacification of the islands to- j
morrow would in no way change it. It is a sentiment
held from the point of view of our welfare at home
and arises in a desire lor the perpetuity of our free
institutions and the peaceful development of our re
sources by a free people.
In its essence this sentiment is nut partisan. It
has no sympathy with Mr. Bryan's labored effort to
make politics out of it. With Senator Morgan, the
Democratic leader of the Senate, advocating expan
sion, standing for the killing of all the Samoans and
Filipinos as a necessary precedent to the introductioi
of civilization, and Sep.;;: or Hoar, the Republica
leader of the Senate, opposing expansion, imperialism
I and slaughter, and supported by Republicans like

REVIVE THE OLD PLAN.
T F the Board of Supervisors desires to secure a
I practical plan for adapting the present sever sys
tem of San Francisco to a new system which will
provide the city with adequate drainage, it would bet
ter abandon its attempt to get funds by transfer and
adopt the resolutions under which one of ils prede
cessors a few years ago began the same work.
As we recall the history of the former sewer com
mission, it was composed of three unsalaried com
missioners, who were authorized to employ engin
eers and supervise their work. An appropriation of
$30,000 was made and a general plan of operations
ted. But before any tangible results had been
produced the Board of Supervisors which created
this commission went out <>! ot'fice and a machine-
Democratic board came in. The members of the
latter were unable to control the patronage of the
â on as it had been embodied, and in order
to secure the appropriation for their dependents, they
repealed the sewer resolutions, dismissed the com
â  loners and turned the money into the Street De
partment fund.
This was a triumph for machine politics which re
sulted in the entire eclipse of the movement for
sewer reform. Professor Davidson, Irving M. Scott
and Engineer Mendell, as we remember, comprised
the sewer commission. They employed Engineers
Manson and Grunsky, who. with a force of draughts
men, were proceeding to reduce the sewerage prob
lem of San Francisco to a scientific basis, when the
entire scheme was interrupted by the appearance of
the political bosses and the repealing orders of the
Board of Supervisors.
Nothing has occurred since the dismissal of this
commission to render its plans obsolete, and the
work should be taken up now exactly where it was
then left off. The same gentlemen are still alive
and available for commissioners. Doubtless all three
would accept an appointment at the hands of this
Board of Supervisors and serve without compensa
tion. But at the outset the hoard must make up its
mind to one thingâ it can procure no plans that will
command respect, nor secure the services of compe
tent commissioners or engineers, unless politics is en

tirely eliminated from the movement. If the work
is to be done by the City Hall politicians nothing
will be accomplished toward the solution of the
problem, and when the time comes to vote bonds
the people will bury the entire scheme under a shoal
of ballots.
If the present Board of Supervisors appoints a
commission it should thereafter turn it loose with
instructions to report a scientific plan, not one de
signed to promote the interests of sewer builders,
street contractors or private interests of any kind.
FLAUNTING IMMORALITY.
IN the course of its campaign for the purification of
the city from the grosser evils which corrupt its
youth The Call has accomplished much in the way
of reform. The racetrack gambling, which led to the
ruin of so many lives, has been suppressed, and the
exposure of indecent pictures in the phonograph par
lors has been restricted by the conviction and the
punishment of several of the proprietors of such
places.
In the campaign thus far the object of The Call has
been to direct attention to corrupting evils wherever
carried on, whether downtown or out at the racetrack;
but it has now to point out that some evils are the
more offensive by reason of the place where they are
maintained. A public scandal is more pernicious than
a hidden scandal, inasmuch as it poisons a larger num
ber of minds, and so a gambling room or other nefa
rious place increases in its pernicious influence in
proportion to the openness and boldness with which
it is carried on.
In the course of its fight against gambling rooms,
poolrooms and lewd picture rooms The Call has had
occasion to point out that a considerable number of
such places are conducted along Market street and
flaunt their iniquity in the face of all who pass up and
down that thoroughfare. As it is the main highway
of the retail trade of the city, the promenade along
which pass the great mass of men and women engaged
in shopping, and the avenue over which the great
htrcetcar lines run, any corrupting evil tolerated there
becomes in the very nature of things the cause of a
far greater injury to the community than if hidden
away from sight in the slums or among the less tra
versed streets, and its suppression is, therefore, of the
greater importance.
It is of course impossible to rid a community alto
gether of the vicious elements of humanity. There
will be always more or less depravity in every con
siderable city so long as the human race remains what
it is. It is not too much to demand, however, that
vice shall be made to hide itself and depravity to seek
concealment. There is no reason why dives, gam
bling rooms, nickel-in-the-slot machines, indecent
picture?, lewd and vicious places of almost all kinds
should be tolerated on Market street.
The police and the Commissioners above them have
been very indulgent to certain forms of vice along
Market street and in neighborhoods almost as well
known and frequented. There have been suspicions
iif men high in authority in police circles being inter
( sted in gambling rooms and dives and worse. Pos
sibly some of the proprietors of these places on Mar
treet may have protection in high quarters. If it
be so. it is time the public should know it. If not,
why arc they tolerated in their shameless depravity?
rROM all parts of the State come reports of
extraordinary preparations for the celebration of
Dewcy day. It is to he a festival in the true
sense of the word. The occasion is not one to be
commemorated with perfunctory ceremonies, but by
the spontaneous outbursting of popular rejoicing over
a great victory in honor of the hero who accom
plished it.
As the day is to he one of unusual interest it will
he one in which every citizen should have the privi
lege of joining. All will delight in taking some part
in the celebration of tiie day and all ought to have
full freedom to do so. The festival should be made a
true public holiday, so that all business men and their
employes may have their share in the pleasures it will
â  1 to the patriotic.
It has been the custom of a considerable number
of people in California to ignore public holidays as
far a.- possible and to keep their employes at work
and their places of business open as on ordinary days.
Such people are probably animated in adopting that
course less by motives of avarice than by an indiffer
ence to the occasion of the holiday. They lack sym
pathy with popular movements and go on about their
lions in life as if there were nothing in the world
worth living for except business.
liven such people can hardly afford to ignore
Dewey day. The great victory of last May is too
fresh in the public mind to have been forgotten by
any; and surely none is so unpatriotic as not to feel a
patriotic pride in it. Therefore, we may expert that
on this occasion every store, shop, factory and ofrke
in the city will be closed and that all will take part in
the festival. Dewey day in San Francisco should be a
holiday for every man, woman and child in the city.

is absolutely necessary to public convenience.
The English army authorities complain of a lack

JUSTICE TO PROCEED.
The Majority Members of the Board
Apparently Favor the Reopen

;
After a struggle waged bitterly for
weeks past, the Mutual Electric Light
Company was granted permission yester
day to erect poles for Its wires throughout
the- city except In that portion of the
business section which is designated as
the fire limits. The action of the board
was a surprise to all parties interested.
From appearances such action was not
contemplated, and the matter passed the
board beyond recall before some members
of the majority realized what had hap
pened.
At the last meeting of the board the
order was passed to print. Subsequently
Supervisor Attridge said he had voted
under a misapprehension and it was gen
erally understood he would vote against
the measure yesterday when it came up
for final passage. It was late in the after
noon when the board was acting on un
finished business. The clerk reads merely
the title of the order, and a number of
minor matters had been finally passed
When he reached the measure which in
sures competition In lighting. This was
read, and Mayor Phelan, following his
usual custom, said: "On final passage.
Hearing no objection, finally passed."
The minority members of the board
smiled, and their exhibition of mirth at
tracted the attention of their associates.
Supervisor Phelps was the first to realize
the action that was taken, and- said: "I
object. 1 did not hear what was going
on." Messrs. Lackmann, Perrault and
Deasy objected to reopening, the matter,
saying they heard and understood and
voted with full knowledge in the premises.
Supervisor Phelps then asked to be re
corded as voting in the negative. Super
visor Kalben made the same request. Su
pervisor Attridge said he understood the
matter was not coming up at the meeting
owing to the absence of Supervisor Bying
ton at Salinas. He was informed there
was much opposition in the Mission to
streets being disfigured with additional
posts
Supervisor Lackmann cut short his ex
planation, saying the question had been
finally disposed of. He raised this as a
point of order, and Mayor Phelan held it
was well taken. Phelps thereupon ap
pealed from the decision of the chair. Six
voted against' sustaining the chairman,
â  but it required nine votes, hence the chair
was sustained.
Lackmann then said that in view of the
board placing Itself on record regarding
the matter of poles outside the fire limits,
he requested the Mayor to affix his signa
ture to the measure, making it a law be
yond recall. For reply his Honor said:
"If the clerk will hand it to me 1 will
' Sign it." This he did.
Three separate times during the subse
quent proceedings Supervisor Phelps tried
to have the minutes of the meeting show
that he voted against the measure. He
first tried to give notice tor a reconsidera
tion, but this was ruled out of order. As
it was signed and approved it had passed
out of possession of the board. Phelps
said he did not like to be "fiimfiammed out
<>!' his vote." The matter was finally
drop] â 
Dr. Perrault Introduced a resolution
that City and County Attorney Lane be
directed to dismiss the apneal in the case
of the Mutual Electric Light Company vs.
the Board of Supervisors. This was
passed. It is an appeal from the decision
of Judge Seawell, and which really fa
vored the city, as it held the Mutual Com
pany had the same right to erect poles
as that enjoyed by any other company.
This closes the incident as far as compe
tition is concerned.
The matter of opening bids for the fur
nishing of the Hall of Justice precipitated
a heated discussion and an acrimonious
debate between Supervisor Perrault and
Architect Frank Shea. The matter was
i introduced by Supervisor Holland, who
asked that Messrs. Byington, aPeasy
Lackmann and Phelps be added to the
regular Building Committee of the board
to share the responsibility of outfitting
the Hall of Justice and building the Mis
sion Police Station. This was adopted.
Supervisor Perrault then moved that b'ds
be rejected and/advertised for again. He
picked the specifications to pieces and
said they were "rotten" and framed to
favor some firm. He assailed the archi
tects, Shea & Shea, placing the burden of
blame on them.
Frank Shea, who was present, replied
feelingly to the allegations. He said he
was thunderstruck that a member of the
Board of Supervisors not familiar with
past proceedings of the board could stand
there and east reflections on a firm as
honorable as that of the member who
had just spoken. He characterized his
utterances such as a child would not
make, they were so easily refuted. He
objected to a statement that there was
a "Takedown" coming to the architect.
His remark that the gentleman was prob
ably acquainted with such matters was
applauded by the lobby.
After some general discussion, partici
pated in by persons who had bid on the
furnishing, Supervisor Collins moved
the bids be opened at once. The bids were
ns follows:
For furnishings and fittingsâ George II Fuller
Desk Company, $45,456; Lenny Bros., $51,500;
Joseph Frederick & Co., $56,208; J. i". Oakes,

$69,021. The former bid, which was. vetoed by
Mayor Phelan, was $77,990.
The Superintendent of Streets was
given positive orders to move the fence
which surrounds the Baldwin Hotel ruins
back to the line of the building. At pres
ent It shuts off all the sidewalk and a
portion of the street on Ellis street, to
the damage of all the shopkeepers in tne
neighborhood and J to the discomfort of
pedestrians. ,''â¢',"
The order presented at the last meet-
Ing of the board permitting betting on
coursing was passed to print by a vote
of 7 to 4. It will come before the board
for a final passage at the next meeting.
Supervisor Deasy objected to the board
sanctioning the gambling on the ground
that there was no difference between
coursing dogs and racing horses for men
to bet upon them. Deasy, Heyer, Lack
mann and Perrault represented the
minority in the vote.
All dally newspapers published in this
city can bid upon the printing of the de
linquent tax list. An effort was made to
shut out papers having less than SOOO cir
culation, but this was defeated.
The following resolution was adopted
as preliminary to one Inviting proposals
for the repaying of Bush street, made
necessary by the*removal of the rails
owned by the Sutter-streel Railway
Company. It reads:
Resolved, That the subject matter of said
communication be and Is hereby referred to
g the City and County Attorney tor his opin
ion as to whether or not the action pro-
posed 1? proper, in order to enable the city
and county to recover the cost of said work
las proposed, and damages from the Gut
ter-street Hallway Company; also the laid
City and County Attorney Is hereby direct
ed to bring such suite against said rail
way company, at the time and in the man
ner an in his judgment may be proper.
The following resolution regarding the
opening of Twenty-seventh street
through the property of St. Luke Hos
pital Association was adopted:
Whereas, a petition of property owners
was filed on March 21. 1899, for the open
ing of Twenty-seventh street, from San
Jose avenue to Valencia street, and, where
as, it appears that this is one of the
streets that should be extended to Valen
cia street, and that there can be no doubt
the board of directors of St. Luke's Hos
pital will' be reasonable in Its demands
as to the value of the property necessary
for said extension, therefore
Resolved, That no further consideration
of this matter will be had by this board
until the property owners and parties in
terested in the extension of said street
meet, confer and decide as to the value
of the property to be acquired for said ex
tension, and the district to be assessed
therefor, and flle a report thereon with
the board.
In order that the number of citizens to
assume charge of the Fourth of July cele
bration be equally divided and all sections
of the city represented each member of
the board was requested to select and
submit the names of eight citizens from
his ward to the Committee on Finance
and Auditing on or before Tuesday, May
2, 1899, so that the call for a meeting may
be made in sufficient Lime to allow suit
able preparations for the saiu celebra
tion.
The subject matter of a communication
filed by Fred A. Elliott was referred to
a special committee consisting of Super
visors Deasy, Byington and Lackmann.
It submits a general outline of the pur
poses and duties to be subserved and per
formed in the service of a suitable per
son to be continuously employed as an
examiner and expert of the records and
accounts of the municipal institutions and
departments, and of such officials who
collect fees that are required to be paid
into the city and county treasury or for
which the city and county is accountable.
The Independent Order of Odd Fellows
was granted permission to extend a ban
ner across Market street at Seventh.
The following order granting the Mar
ket-street Railway Company permission
to operate street cars over certain streets
by means of electricity was again referred
to the Street Committee. Efforts have
been made to keep the company oft' Geary
street as far as an electric road is con
cerned. The company declines to build
unless allowed to traverse Geary street.
The resolution reads:
The people of the city and county of San
Francisco do ordain as follows: Section 1.
Permission is hereby granted to the Mar
ket-street Railway Company to operate by
means of electricity, with modern improve
ments and appliances, or by such other
means as may be sanctioned by law, all
those certain street railroads within the
city and county of San Francisco for which
said company is now the holder, by as
signment from or successor to the grantees
therein named, of franchises heretofore
granted by the Board of Supervisors of
said city and county upon the following
named streets: Sixth street, from Brannan

chise for an electric line commencing at
Geary street and Grant avenue and con
necting with the tracks of the Market
Street Railway Company on Geary street,
and thence along Grant avenue to Bush
street and on Bush street to Sansome
street, connecting with the same system
at that point. It was referred to the
Street Committee.
Spring Valley Water Works protested
against the action of the' Finance Com
mittee in reducing its bill for March. The
bill called for the sum of $20,996 63, but
$6110 91 was taken therefrom.

RUSSIANS IN ALASKA
Editor of The Call: Unjustly offend
ed and feeling the insult given to 35,000
members of the orthodox church, peo
ple and clergy, living under the pro
tection of the Stars and Stripes, I pub
licly protest against the unfounded as
sertions publicly made by Mr. Curtis
P. Coe, as published in the Examiner
on last Tuesday morning-, in the re
view on clerical club proceedings un
der he caption, "Movement to Close
Theaters on Sundays."
First Among many an American
born citizen, and as a canonically or
dained minister, I worked in this field
since ISSS. Previous to this' I was a
missionary assistant in Alaska. Among
many Americans, Governor Swineford
is one who approved of our work in
Alaska. *
Secondâ To show the falsity of Mr.
Coe's assertion, with which he so bit
terly attacks the Greek church, I am
compelled to set forth the fact that I
have been connected for some years
with the diocesan consistory, to which
all priests must report, and I do not
know of any case of the kind to which
our accuser refers. I admit there have
been instances in which our preachers
declared that non-Christian unbeliev
ers have sometimes fallen to the level
of the brute.
Third â Mr. Cue declares that in the
field, to which he has not been called,
"most of the people belonged to the
Greek church and knew nothing of
morality." I repeat that he is correct
in regard to the population, for actual
ly nine-tenths of all the people on the
Island Kodiak and the surrounding
places are members of the orthodox
church. Now, naturally arises this
question: Is this missionary of the
Baptist slighted because the parish
priests of the orthodox church in his
neighborhood prove to be a barrier to
the prosperity of his work by their zeal
in their own holy mission?
Fourth â About the "morality in the
Greek church": for want of time and
space I shall put forth but this one
statement: Look into San ntin,
which contains over a thousand pris
oners, and you will find that only five
of the number were baptized in the
orthodox church. And out of these
five there is but one Russian, one Cir
cassian, etc. Yours truly,
SEBASTIAN DABOVICH,
A priest of the Holy Orthodox Church,

''When I have a difference
with a business man I go to
him and talk it over with him;
I do not stay away f-'-om him
and listen to what his ene
mies have to say. I have been
working- hard these past few
weeks formulating a new grain
rate schedule that will, I
think, be satisfactory to the
people. Instead of staying
away I have gone to Mr.
Stubbs of the Southern Pacific
Company, and he has assisted
me materially in arranging
the new schedule. I am not
schooled in railroad matters,
but I have learned that a
'horizontal seale 1 is not effi
cacious, and in making up the
new schedule I am dipping
the present rates from
place to place and making re
ductions where I think they
are compatible with good
business sense. In this Mr.
Stubbs has been of the utmost
value to me, for his knowl
edge of rates and freight mat

that cannot be denied." â
[From an explanation made
by Railroad Commissioner
Laumeister to a representative
of The Call of how he will pro
mulgate the new grain rate
schedule that is "to -work the
salvation of the California
farmer.'']
As in most matters that affect its
purse, the Southern Pacific of Kentucky
has won in the grain rate case. By a res
olution adopted by the Railroad Commis
sioners yesterday the Blackstock resolu
tion, as amendi-d by its author, was
adopted by the votes of Commissioners
Blnckstoek and Laumeister, Commission
er Edson voting against it.
When the resolution passed it was
so amended that it directed the Attorney
General to apply at once to the Federal
ruurt for a dismissal of the injunction
suit now pending against the railroad,
and, upon fin opinion by Attorney General
Ford himself, such an order is all that is
necessary- to compel him to call the suit
oft and subject the California farmers
again to the arbitrary and ruinous rates
on grain transportation that the Southern
Pacific has in the past been pleased to
This action by the railroad element of
the Board of Railroad Commissioners was
not effected, however, without a fight.
Commissioner Edson stood to his guns
find had them well trained on the trenches
the railroad company has thrown up
n round, its usurped prerogatives. He
opened the day's meeting by introducing
a resolution to "reconsider, repeal and re
scind" the Blackstock resolution, and
made a l'>ng and strong speech in favor
C'f his measure, notwithstanding it was
a foregone conclusion before he began
that the Southern Pacific's will would be
done despite him.
Commissioner Laumeistfr, who Is ar
ranging an entirely new schedule on new
and unique lines, voted to pass the Black-
Ftock resolution, and intimated that he
was a friend of the people and an enemy
of C. I. Huntlngton's cinch upon them.
A few minutes later. In conversation with
a representative of The Call, he acknowl
edged that J. C. Stubbs, third Ice presi
dent of the Southern Pacific, was author
ity for and author of most of the figures
that are going into the new schedule that
the .Southern Pacific's end of the Board of
Commissioners is promulgating.
In speaking to his resolution to recon
sider and repeal. Commissioner Edson
"In voting for the Blackstock resolution
in the first place I did so that i might
be in a position to move for its reconsid
eration when the next meeting of the [
board should occur. ,
"I wish to say in the beginning that
1 am no enemy of the railroad and I do
not think there was a single individual
that voted for me that looked upon me as
their enemy. The peopie are not enemies
of the railroad. There are many grave
questions in dispute, as the complainant
in this case; denies the right of the Board
of Railroad Commissioners to fix any

"The Attorney General estimates the
cost, and in my opinion he is quite )lb

"The assessed valuation of the property
of the State by the 'a.-i assessment was

sand dollars would raise over $6.8,000.
Th^re are over 300,000 voters in the State

would raise the amount. Who that votes

"Let us, then, rescind the Blackstock
resolution and go on and Investigati . ana
if we find discriminations or excessive
charges try and have them corrected, ana
we can keep below the B per cent <>n
grain and far below the 25 per C< nt on

ask or expect." ( ,
Commissioner Edson's resolution to re
scind and repeal" the resolution ol Jr.
Blackstock did not go unchallenged i>y
that gentleman. He was on his feet as
soon as Mr. Kdson hnd finished ana od
jocted strenuously to the words "rescind
and repeal." and moved thai they be
mricken out. After Borne parley Mr. 1-..1-
Bon agreed and the resolution was adopt
ed as amended. Then Mr. Blackstock
asked permission to withdraw his meas
ure before final action was taken, and it
was nunted. He amended by substitut
ing a clause In place of the Laumeister
addition to the original resolution, which
directed The Attorney General to at oneo
request the Federal court to discontinue
and dismiss the grain rate case. Then
th.Â» resolution as amended was offered
for action and adopted, only Edson voting
against it. . .
Excusing this action and endeavoring: to
vindicate their championship of the
Southern Pacific's int. rests, Laumeister
and Blackstock both sought the floor in
order to make a speech. Laumeister got
it, and in speaking said:
"1 know that Mr. Kdson is a friend of
the railroad. I know, too. that the rail
road would rather this case go on than
lismlssed. With this case in the
courts our hands are tied, but if we dis
miss it we are free to go into the rate
matter as business men should and fix
another rate. In time for this year's crop,
that will be satisfactory to the people.
This w Â«? are already fixing and
will be ready to present it at the next
ag."
Failli B to pet the floor at the first
iump Mr. Blackstock failed to explain at
all With the adoption of the Blaekstoek
resolution, as meagerly amended, the
Commissioners dropped the matter of
rate entirely and took up the case of
the Stockton differential. I-aumiester
r. ported that there were many residents
i :' Stockton who desired to consult with
the board on that proposition, and on his
motion it went over to the next meeting,
OFF ON DIFFERENT TACKS.
THE British ships Bidston Hill and Lancing towed out together yesterday and sailed away in different

go for the Government troops in the Philippines.
when the Stocktonians will be requested
to be on hand at 10 o'clock in the morn

In speaking of grain rates later, Mr.
Lauvniester said to a Call reporter: "I
have now nearly prepared a new schedule
which will. I think, be satisfactory to th*>
people. The people have held the S. P.
up as an enemy, but when I have a dif
ference with a business man I go to him
and talk it over. I have Bought the as
sistance of Mr. Btubbs of the S. P. In the
fixing of this new rate, and have found
bis knowledge of such matters of the tit
most value to me. The new schedule will
be ready for presentation at the next
meeting. Already we have figured an

met in conference yesterday with me
directors of the Merchants' Association
for the purpose of discussing a feasible
plan by which the central portion of the
city can be stripped of overground cur-

The plan submitted divided the central
portion of th* city into four parts. The
tir.-t of these divisions comprises tiie
heavily traveled thoroughfares, where
live and exposed wires are most danger
ous. The other three districts are classi
fied according to their Importance. No

third Within twenty-four months and
titose In the fourth within thirty-six
months. Thin plan appeared satisfactory

Assistant Chief Wharfinger Scott !

The British ship Bidston Hill sailed for
Manila yesterday and the American ship
Tacoma left Manila for San Francisco
last Sunday. The captain of the Britisher
â¢ X] i eta to make the run down in steam- i
boat time. The new tug Fearless had to
give the Bidston Hill a long tow off shore.
Side by side with the Fearless and her
tow went the tug S.->a King and the Brit
ish ship Lancing. The latter 18 bound for
md to load coal and the two vessels
made a pretty picture as they made sail
after being cast off by the tups.
The Bidston Hill did not take away
within 300 tons of her carrying capacity.
When Bhe was chartered there was no
certainty aa to when the steamers would
get back from Manila. They all came in
in a bunch, and of curse all the merchan
on hand was loaded Into them. This
left the sailing vessel with a light load,
and a considerable quantity of hay was
put aboard to fill up. Still, the vessel
d everything that the soldiers re
quire and H..ni.- supplies for the warships.
In her case it is lit. rally true that there
v as "everything from a needle to an an
chor" in her hold. There is food for man
: is:: clothing for the soldiers and
harness for the mules; needles for the
boys to mend their uniforms and under
clothing and a couple of anchors tor
Dewey'a fleet. Incidentally, the Bidston
Mill took down a large consignment ol
coffins. Even -with all this assortment she
v.i ii! away rather light.
The ship Tacoma, now on her way here
from Manila, will probably be a long time
making the voyage. She has been away
from San Francisco quite a while, and I
must be very foul. In the tropics It :
does not take the barnacles long to grow
on a vessel's bottom, and the Tacoma has
undoubtedly got her share of them. On
her arrival here she will be drydocked and
overhauled and will then start fur Manila
again with another load of cattle.
The transport. Morgan City will get
away for Manila to-day. Captain Dillon
will not go out in her and a new third
officer will also be appointed this morn

of office Mr. Scott has proved a most ef
ficient officer and has made a host of
friends. He retires from the service of
the State and enters that of the United
States with the good wishes of everybody
on the front.
gcott'S retirement brings forth a host
( ,f candidates for the position of assist

Dryden, wharfinger at Main street; Tom
Casey wharfinger at Steuart street; D.
M Angeir. wharfinger at Third street,
and a dozen others are after the place.
Crowley and Dryden are Republicans and
base their hones on the fact that the
President of the board is generally con
ceded the appointment. The Democrats,
however, do not like the attempt being
made by the Governor to foist I. S. C nad
bourno'lnto the commission, nnd as they
are in the majority they may retaliate
by making ihe appointment themselves.
It is on this state of affairs that Casey
and Angeir baÂ»Â« their hopes. Scott's res
ignation will be handed in to-day, and
the wire pulling will begin.
The schooner Vine, after lying off
Meiggs wharf for nearly a week, .secured
a non-union crow and got away for Nico
ki yesterday.
The missionary schooner Hiram Bing
haxn, which ' Captain Challeston of the
barkentlne Kuth thought was loajt,
reached port from Kusaie yesterday. Bat
was sixty-three days making the run,
while the Ruth came from Guam In
thirty-six days. The Hiram Hingham
was s<-'nt out by the American Hoard of
Foreign Missions about two years ago,
and since then has visited the Caroline,
Marshall, Marquesas and Gilbert groups
hi Islands, attending to the wants of the
missionaries. She comes here for an over
hauling and to be refitted. Captain Wal
kup reports that he experienced nothing
but ll^ht winds and calms during the
to San Francisco.
The Polynesian Steamship Company that
was organized in the East to run between
San Francisco, Hawaii, Tahiti and the
Marquesas has received Its quietus for
the time bring. The Cramps were Inter
ested in the line and they were to build
the ships. Plnet & Co. of this city, who
operate the line of sailing vessels now
carrying the French mail to Tahiti, were
also in the scheme and the sailing vessels
were to give way for the steamers. The
sailing vessels will continue running,
however, and no one knows when the
steamers will be built.
The Governor of Tahiti had agreed to
pay the Polynesian line a large subsidy
and that was the main incentive to the
building of the vessels. The French Gov
ernment took a hand in the business and
cabled the Governor to enter into no con
tract and give no subsidy in any circum
stance to a foreign me, as the French
Government bad under consideration the
running of a line of steamers between
France and Tahiti. That settled the
whole business and the Polynesian Steam
ship Company now exists in name only.
lieutenant Buhne took charge of the
ex-warship Thetis yesterday. The vessel
is being fixed up for a cruise to Siberia,
but it will take more 'nan a general over
hauling and a few coats of paint to make
her a comfortable vessel. One thing is
certain â ehe will never carry any rein
deer, as there is no place on deck for
them. There is a small space amidship
where a few might be corraled, but the
deer would have a lively time of it keep
ing their horns out of the way of the main
boom. The Rev. Sheldon Jackson la going
up on the vessel, but his duties and those
of Lieutenant Buhne will be confined to
making inquiries about reindeer alone, as
the vessel will not be able to carry any
back with her.
The Thetis is not considered a fit ves
sel to send to Siberia and the Navy De
partment ought to know it. She was con
demned three years ago and since then
has been lying in "rotten row" at the
navy yard. Now she goes into commis
sion as a revenue cutter and will sail
shortly for Siberia. Her hull and engines
are fairly good, but the boilers are in bad
shape and will have to be thoroughly
overhauled. The officers' quarters are
vary poor and the 3ailors do not fare
much better.

THE PRESIDIO RIOT.
Three Soldiers Convicted and Ordered
by Judge -raham to Appear for
Sentence To-Day.
The cases of C. M. Cauder, Arthur Bil
lings. P. Simmons and Charles Leiska, the
four soldiers charged with malicious mis
chief and disturbing the peace, were
called before Judge Graham yesterday
morning.
The complaining witness, Adolph Reh
feld, saloon-keeper, Greenwich and Lyon
streets, was in court with his wife and
live children, who have been made home
less by the destruction of their property
by lire caused by the soldiers during the
riot a week ago last Sunday night. Reh
feld identified. Killings, Simmons and
Leiska as three of the soldiers who threw
rocks at his place and yelled to burn it
down. He was corroborated by Henry A.
Wells, a cook, and as far as Leiska was
concerned by Policeman Herring, who
testified that he saw Leiska with his coat
off throwing rocks at the saloon and yell
ing, "Burn her down."
The Judge dismissed the case against
Cauder but found the other three defend
ants guilty and ordered them to appear
for sentence this morning. Lieutenant
Devore interceded for the men, as they
were going to Manila probably to-day to
fight for their country, and asked that they
be reprimanded and set at liberty, and the
Judge said he would give his decision to
day. __________^_
FEARS COMPETITION
FROM FILIPINOS
J. W. KERR WARNS LOCAL MAN
UFACTURES OF DANGER.
The Proposition tc Change the Tariff
Means Death to Some of the
Western Industries.
At a recent executive meeting of the di
rectors of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association a resolution was in
troduced by J. "W. Kerr, and adopted
which was of more than ordinary signifi
cance. It relates to one of the principal
subjects that is now agitating the coun
try, whether imperialism shall or shall not
prevail. The resolution reads as follows:
Whereas, In tho dispatches from the Philip
pines to-day there appears a statement to the
effect "that the American merchants in
Manila have sent a communication tv the
Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco re
questing that body to secure certain changes
in the tariff affecting goods from that port;"
and whereas, the manufacturerers and indus
tries of the Pacific Coast and th 'He depend
ing upon them stand in as much need Of pro
tection from thf Orient to-day us ever the
Atlantic s.;il ;i!'l c!M from the manufacturers
of Europe; therefore, be it
Resolved, Thai the president of this asso
ciation communicate with the Chamber of
Commerce and keep this association informed
on this matter, to the end that no action he
taken which would injuriously affect our home
market and our struggling Industries.
In presenting the matter Mr. Kerr stat
ed that in the Philippine islands there are
millions of people who are glad to work
fur a very few rents a day, as food, cloth
ing and shelter costs but little. Already
capital is looking toward the new territory
with a view of investment, the principal
advantages being cheap fuel, cheap ma
terial, ami. above all. cheap labor. La
boring men of the United States would
not have a ghost of a show In competition
with the 10-cents-a-day natives of
Islands. While the present protective tar
iff is in force the laborers of this coast.
and the United States, in fact, have i>ut
little to fear from the islanders, but the
iiT an â¢â â¢iit the tariff is removed wages will
tumble, because neither local manufac
turers nor laborers can enter into compe
tition. He i illed attention to the first
move in this directionâ the effort (if the
merchants of -Manila to Becure certain
changes in the tariff on goods from that
port. It i? 1 the entering wedge, he said.
;.inl the association should be on its guard
to see thai it finds no crack Into which it
can be Inserted.
'.elpless and Starving.
A peculiar cnsf of want and gr-ncral
misfortune is In the hands of Secretary
Wadham of the Eureka Society for the

mer, the eminent kidney and bladder
specialist, after years of study and re-
search, and after test on test that
never varied in the grand result, an-
nounced the discovery of Swamp-Root
which has proven itself a most won-
derful cure for all diseases of the kid-
neys and bladder.
The immediate symptoms and first
proofs of weak kidneys are pain or dull
ache in the back, rheumatism, dizzi-
ness, headaches, nervousness, heart
trouble, pain in the limbs, bloating,
sallow complexion, puffy or dark cir-
cles under the eyes, bladder irritation,
suppression of urine, obliged to pass
water often day and night, worn-out,
tired feeling, lack of ambition.
If your water, when allowed to re-
main undisturbed in a glass or bottle
for twenty-four hours, forms a sedi-
ment or settling, or has a cloudy ap-
pearance, it is evidence that your kid-
neys and bladder need immediate at-
tention.
Swamp-Root has been tested in so
many ways, in hospital work, in pri-
vate practice, among the helpless too
poor to purchase relief, and has proved
so successful in every case that a spe-
cial arrangement has been made by
which all readers of The Call who have
not already tried it may have a sam-
ple bottle sent absolutely free by mail.
Also a book telling more about Swamp-
Root and containing some of the thou-
sands upon thousands of testimonial
letters received from men and women
who owe their good healthâ in fact,
their very livesâ to the wonderful cur-
ative properties of Swamp-Root. Be
sure and mention The San Francisco
| Daily Call when sending your address
to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton, N. Y.
This great modern discovery is for
j sale at most drug stores in fifty-cent
and one-dollar sizes. Don't make any
mistake, but make a note of the namp.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 24.â Trading was of a
listless sort to-day, and except for an early
spurt in the specialties, prices declined to the
end. when the market was weak. \
Smart recessions appeared in many stocks j
while most of the active list was lower. No j
â¢very serious consideration teemed to be given i
to the ; test of the German Embassador I
against the utterances of a naval officer just j
returned from Manila. The strength of ster
ling exchange attracted some attention, con- |
tir.uing as ft does In spite of comparative easl- I
ness of money, which ranged from 3 to 4 per
cent for call loans. The favorable bank state- j
ment of Saturday failed to arouse any notice- j
able Increase In outside Interest in the mar
ket and the bears accordingly reasoned that it |
was opportune to try some such ventures.
Anaconda mining was very strong, rising 8
points, only one of which it lost before the i
close. The advance In Anaconda was associ
ated with reports of me deal in connection
â with a copper combination; moreover copper
advanced abroad. London was a seller of |
Eome 30,000 shares of stock and the West as ,
â well .- large traders also sold.
Commission business was very light. Crop
uncertainties may account for me neavy feel
ing ol the market, and private crop advices
were said to have been received which were;
not altogether favorable. This received some
credence because of the firmness of the wheat
market. The market was altogemer uninter
esting and almost featureless. i
Irregularity cropped out to-day In the bond j
market, but the changes generally -were nar- .
row and there was a consistent demand for
the newer Issues at improved prices. Total
sales, $3,905,000. U. S. new 4s coupon and the 5s ;
coupon advanced V 4, and do reg. % in the |
bid price.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 24.â Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were idle to-day except ;
for mines and coppers. The tendency was to
dullness. The Philippine news caused realiz- j
ing sales by recent American bulls and prices
steadily sagged, closed heavy at the bottom. I
The exceptions were Norfolk and Western and |
Denver and Rio Grande preferred, which were
both bought here and by New York. Coppers
were the feature. New York Bent Anacondas
at 11%, and they closed near 12. principally
on American buying in the afternoon. Tintos !
was 46%. Spanish fours were 59. Fifty-four j
thousands pounds gold in bars was bought by
the bank. Bullion dealers expect silver to be I
twisted up soon on the smelters' combination.
. NEW YORK GRAIN AND PRODUCE.
NEW YORK, April Flour receipts, 24,118
barrels; exports, 9269. Easy on spring patents,
but steady for winter wheat brands. Wheat

Options opened easy on rainy news from the
West, but developed subsequent strength on I
an unexpectedly large visible supply de- ;
crease. By reason of a big shrinkage in local |
stock the May option was strong all day. The :
latter was helped by covering and higher
freight quotations; closed strong at %@%c ad

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April Wheat started rather
firm, but offerings were freer than could be I
absorbed at the opening prices, and the tend
ency became downward. The weakness did
not last long, however, and a reaction set in :
that put short sellers to rout and sent prices

THE STOCK MARKET.
Local securities were very active on the
morning session and prices showed numerous
fluctuations, Paauhau Plantation advanced to
$43 r>o, Giant Powder t ntra Water
to $71 12'->, Hawaiian Commercial to $105 and
Hutchinson to $34 25. The general tone of the
market was strong.
Jn the afternoon Hawaiian advanced an
other point, but others of the leaders showed
some weakness.
Mining stocks were stronger at an ad
vance- of a few cents. The telegram from the
pump said: "Elevator working Steadily.
Water In the 1750 level winze is 31 feet 4
inches below the station. The second eleva
tor arrived last night."
The following ore shipments were made by
rail from the mines of Eureka district, Ne
vada, for the week ending April 21: Diamond
mine, GG.340 pounds; Eureka Consolidated, 155,
--730; Jackson, 67.460; Joe Flynn-Mineral Hill,
36,000.
Annual meetings are announced as follows:
North Star Mining Company, May 10; Origi
nal Empire Mill and Mining Company, May
10; Union Gold Mining Company, May 6; Grass
Valley Water Company, May 10; East Sierra
Nevada Mining Company, May S.
At the Consolidated California and Virginia
mine during the past week the C. and C.
shaft has been cleaned out and all necessary
repairs made for a depth of 36 feet below the
1850 level, the shaft being ready to receive the
new elevator. On the surface work has been
continued on the hoisting engine for the 1750
winze and the compressor to be used for work
below that point. 1400 levelâ The west drift
has been extended 17 feet; total distance west
from C. and C shaft, 470 feet The face is in
soft hanging wall rock, showing less water
than for the past two weeks. 16.10 levelâ The
bulkhead of brick and cement to retain the
water from the upper levels has been com
pleted. The raise from this level to the drift
connecting with the Opnir shaft has been
cleaned out :.i"l the connecting drift is being
repaired, as this drift and raise must be kept
open for ventilation. The pipe system from
the 1650 down through the old stopes connect
ing with the northwest passage on the 1750
Is being repaired, so that the water may be
carried into the old stopes through to the
Houth end of the stopes. 1750 level â The winze
station is being repaired and put in order to
receive the compressed air hoist. The water
in the winze is now 29 feet below the sta
tion.
In the Best & Belcher and Gould & Curry
mines, in the Oshlston shaft connection, a
light platform has been built on the Sutro
tunnel level to catch up water falling down
the shaft, and a fair percentage of the water
is caught up and sent out to the Sutro tun
nel. The water has fallen in the shaft during
the past week 3 feet 10 inches. Total depth
below station. 70 feet 4 inches. They have
removed the boiler from the Bonner shaft to
this shaft and have started in the collar of
the shaft getting timbers in place preparatory
to repairing the shaft.
In the Sierra Nevada mine, on the 140 level,
the raise started in the north drift at a point
223 feet north from the west drift to connect
with the Riley tunnel hay been advanced 21
feet: total height, 79 feet; top in porphyry and
clay, with seams of Quartz through it. 900 level
âThe north drift started in west crosscut 2
has been advanced 12 feet; total length. 20
feet; face in a mixture of porphyry and clay.
In the Ophir mine, in the old Central tunnel
workings, the second crosscut from the north
west drift was extended 5 feet; total, 30 feet.
In the last five feet the formation has
changed. After passing through solid quartz
a siram of black clay was found, beyond the
clay a mixture of clay, quartz and porphyry,
and now in the face more quartz is found.
In the west drift an air passage has been
opened, giving much better air. This drift
was cleaned out for 13 feet; total, 139 feet,
through very heavy ground that required care
ful timbering. They have a few seta now to
put in before the ground will be all caught
up. The Sutro tunnel connection was ex
tended 12 feet; total, DO feet; face in hard
hanging wall rock. The drift northeast from
the Sutro tunnel, following a stringer of
quartz, has been extended 4 feet; total length,
12 feet The quartz Btill continues through the
formation and is irregular. The walls of this
stringer are now mixed with quartz. There is
a well-defined clay seam on the footwall of the
quartz stringer.

INSTEAD OF THE
SURGEON'S KNIFE
The Tragic Suicide of
H. Garcelon.
ILLNESS PARTLY FANCIED
BLEW OUT HIS BRAINS WITH A
REVOLVER.
His Physicians Tried to Persuade
Him That His Sickness Was Not
as Serious as He
* Imagined.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call, \
1428 Park street, April 24.
Because he fancied that he would have
to undergo a surgical ration and
dreaded the ordeal. Horace Garcelon,
formerly a bookkeeper in the employ of
Lev! Strauss & Co., blew out his brains
this afternoon with a 44-caliber Colt's re
volver of ancient pattern.
Garcelon had been living with his wid
owed mother at 1553 Rail] avenue. He |
had long complained of kidney trouble,
and about three months ago pave up his
position on account of his ailment. Drs. |
Stafford and Keys, ho had been attend- ;
ing him, assured him that his sickness j
was not serious, and he insisted that he j
would die unless an operation was per- I
formed, which the physicians declared i
was unnecessary.
Garcelon's mother left him in the house I
about 3 i clock this afternoon while she I
went to visit a neighbor. She returned \
nt 4 o'clock to lind the house filled with
Graoke. She detected the smell of burned j
powder and at once imagined the worst. ,
Hastening to Joseph Murizio, a neighbor, i
she told him of her fears. Marizio rushed !
to the house and found Garcelon lying on !
his bed with the clothing saturated with
hia blood. There was a gaping wound in j
the head, which told plainly of the cause
of death. The deceased left no message
explaining why he had taken his life.
Three chambers of the revolver were
empty, but only one of the shots fired
took "effect. One went through the side
of the building and another cut a wire
holding a picture, dropping It on the
bod beside the suicide.
Deceased was about 45 years old and a
widower. Deputy Coroner Fowler de
cided not to remove the body to the !
Morgue, but will hold the inquest at the
house.
The doctors who had been attending
Garcelon state that his sickness was not
as serious as he imagined and i eve that
he worried over the matter until he be
came temporarily insane. As an evidence
that Garcelon had contemplated suicide
for some time and that he had finally
iixed upon to-day as the time for his
self-destruction, it is stated that '<..â  has
been urging his mother and daughter to
take- a trip into the country for several
weeks past.
This morning he visited Rev. John Han
non of the Methodist Church, South, and
asked to be baptized. The minister want
ed him to wait until next Sunday night,
ns it was not customary to attend to
such matters on week days. < rarcelon
insisted that he wished to join the church
at once, so that if anything happened to
him he would be prepared to meet his
Maker at once. His earnestness so im
pressed Rev. Mr. Hannon that he finally
administered the rite of baptism.

Oakland Office San Francisco < all,
COS Broadway, April 24.
Frank Reardon and James Keef* will
Aot be detained long in jail under suspi
cion of being Implicated in the murder of
John McCann yesterday afternoon. C. H.
Townsend, Edward Roach and Frank Ile
millard will be kept under arrest until af
ter the inqueFt to-morrow night. The In
vestigation of the detectives so far points
to Townsend as the most guilty party, j
Townsend is a member of the Democratic j
County Central Committee and an active
politician.
Detectives Holland, Hodgkins and
Quig.' have been working on the case \
to-day and have discovered several wit
nesses to the murder. The testimony of j
pome hoys corroborates the story of Mrs.
Ivanrovfch that Towiutend was the man
Who knocked McCann Into the gutter and
beat him on the head and face.
During the day hundreds of young f.-i- .
lows around town have swarmed a.roupijnt

dered man signed a notice which he re- |
qupptad the oner to nut on the Morgue !
door stating that no one will be permitted
to view the body except relatives or per
sonal friends. Several women alsi ap
plied for permission â â > see the remains,
but their requests were denied. All the |
evidence so far obtained points to an or
dinary drunken brawl In which all parties
were Intoxicated and when fighting com
mpnend Mc('ann was made the victim of |
his companions. .;..!â 
The autopsy conducted to-night. showed
that Me "arm died from concussion of the

Greene in the Fink divorce suit this after- |
noon !s respected and executed A. "\\ . I
Fink will vacate the palatial family resi
dence at 1024 Union street, Alameda, by
next Wednesday, and fiCrs. May K. Fink,
the plaintiff wife, will assume full con
trol of the property together with $100
monthly alimony, pending the suit.
The matter came up before Judge
i Greene on an order citing Mr. Fink to
I appear and show cause way he should not
pay alimony pending the trial. Mrs. Fink
alleges cruelty in her complaint. She
stated to-day that her husband was in
possession of the family residence and
that she and her children were in need
of maintenance. Eugene P. Bert is her
attorney.
In reply to Mrs. Fink's claims for ali
mony, Mr. Fink's affidavit was presented
in court by Emil Nusbaumer. his attor
[ ney. In this affidavit Mr. Fink avers that
' his wife now has in her own right Ala
meda property worth JlS.Ouo, which, with
the Improvements, is valued at $21,000;
that since the commencement of the suit
she has rented the family residence for
$45 per month and the tenants are to oc
cupy the place on May 1, and that Mrs.
Fink is at present residing in San Fran
cisco with ncr daughter, aged 21 years,
while the husband and a 16-year-old son
have been stopping in the Alameda ;
home.
Defendant then denies that he is a man |
of means His Polk street (San Fran- ;
! cisco> property he values at but $4500; !
i Golden Gate avenue property at $15,000; i
Berkeley property at $5000; the aggregate I
monthly revenue from which is Joo. His j
bank account, he claims, la overdrawn
and his income of not over $250 monthly
Is scarcely sufficient to meet his taxes, in
surance and dally needs.
Mr, Fink moreover avers that "he does
not think ho should be required to mort- j
!.;* property for the purpose of i
humoring this plaintiff in bringing actions i
for divorce against him, this being the !
I action since October 21, 1897.
"The other divorce suit." continues Mr.
Fink's affidavit, "was dismissed October I
â¢7. and at the same time defendant |
made a deed of gift to plaintiff of Ala-
I meda property -worth $18,000 and at- :
ys fees. $250. in consideration that
-hould thereafter treat defendant
kindly and affectionately; but she subse
quently boasted in the presence of other
'is that she had compelled this de
fendant to make the deed. Defendant
i lievea this action is another Bcheme to
endeavor to wrest from him more of his j
property."
The affidavit concludes with the aver
ment that the wife is abundantly able to
irt herself; that defendant has a i
and meritorious defense to her ac
tlon; and a prayer that he be not re
quired to pay her one cent and that the
order to show cause be dismissed.
After making the order above jrlvon
Greene continued the matter until
May 2. and late this afternoon Mr. Fink,
through his attorney, filed a demurrer to ,
the divorce complaint.
The Finks are very well known in Ala
â¢ meda society, and the filing of divorce |
proceedings created quite a sensation.

â  Ã¼bllshed since the U. C. stu-
Hrst assumed a prerogative of
r : i!i^ ami caricaturing the
and vudent body. But the
feel that Masters has used his pen a little more freely than he
â¢ hence their summary action.
The academic council met this morning and the matter came up there.
â¢' the professors introduced the fiubject, stating that he thought the
the hook such as to warrant the most stringent measures being taken
; â¢:â  ose responsible for Its publication. The council with but little dis
â¢\ unanimously ordered the following notice to be placed upon the bul
â -1 r 1 1 :
"At a meeting of the faculty of the college of letters, held this flay, it
was Voted, In accordance with a recommendation of the academic council,
that the â  hief editor of this year's Blue and Gold be dismissed from the uni
versity.
"It was ordered, further, that notice of this action be posted on the unl
verslty bulletin board.
"Atl "JAMBS ST'TTON,
"Recorder of the Faculties."
When seen this afternoon the members of the faculty declined to discuss
the question or to state the special parts of the book which they considered
deserving of censure. They admitted that not one of the instructors who
had been most heavily Joshed had s< nt In any complaint, but insisted that
their attitude was toward the book as a whole.
President Martin J. Kejfogg said: "This is a most unfortunate affair. In
common with the other members "f the faculty, though, I do not see what
else could have be< n Blue and Gold has this time passed beyond all
bearable limits, and l^tead of the legitimate fun which all can enjoy, has
Stooped in vulgarit- ....r which ! feel very much ashamed. Its tone is some
thing which ap a ' wverslty we cannot possibly tolerate. It would seriously
affect "ijr dignity to let such a mntter pass by unnoticed. I do not care to
State what portions of the bonk we think the most objectionable; It is enough
that from cover to cover the faculty feel it has passed beyond the point at
which we can allow such license to go."
The opinion of thf president was echoed by most of the faculty. Professor
Walter Magee, who comes in for several caricatures, explained that it was the
general tone of the publication which, he thought, deserved censure, "I don't
>ie said, "how any student can dare to publish such things as appear in
this year's annual without expecting to be dismissed from college. Our atti
tude is the only one which can be consistently taken. Of course, we regret
very fhueh to inflict this penalty, especially upon a student who otherwise is
held in esteem. But I fail to see what else can be done. The dignity of the
college, and its reputation without, cannot surfer such indiscriminate lam
pooning to be ignored. It was ungentlemanly, to say the least, for any college
man to give such an impression of our college life to the public as must be
gathered from the pages of the Blue and Cold. It represents us as anything
but gentlemen, and that Is enough to warrant our dismissal of the editor."
Masters was called to the president's office this afternoon and President
Kellogg there acquainted him with the faculty's decision. He was told simply
that he would be allowed to remain at the university no longer and that he
might consider himself dismissed. No word of explanation was given save
that as editor of the Hlue and Gold he was deserving of the extreme penalty
Which the faculty could impose, and that he must submit to their decision.
When the news of this became generally known throughout the university
it created a tremendous excitement. The student body as a whole resents the
action of the professors. Petitions at once began to circulate asking that the
decision of the academic council be reconsidered. Practically every student In
the college will attach his signature, and every effort will be made to have
Masters reinstated. Several members of the faculty, though, state that their
action will stand, and that on no account will their order be revoked. The
college men are talking of appealing to the Board of Regents-, and rash
threats are being made that the whole junior class will leave the university
unless Masters is taken back.
THJS SAJN UItAJN UISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 25, 1899.
FABIOLA DAY
CONDEMNED BY
THE MINISTERS
Dr. Dille Leads the
Opposition.
GENEROUS OFFER IS MADE
TWO LADIES WOULD PREFER
TO GIVE THOUSANDS.
Lady Managers Are Surprised That
the Matter Has Been Brought Up
and Are Busy Selling
Tickets.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 24.
Many of the Oakland ministers attended
the usual Monday meeting In San Fran
cisco to-day and decided to denounce in
every way possible the holding 1 of a Fabi
ola Derby day. Rev. E. R. Dille. D. D.,
presided and made a short speech, stat
ing that the curse of Alameda County
and at this time of San Francisco is
Emeryville. He referred to the pernicious
influences of the racetrack and said that
such an institution as Fahiola should be
far above accepting any of the proceeds
from such a disreputable concern as the
racetrack.
Dr. Dille said that many ladies in this
city condemned the project and an
nounced that Mrs. Cooke, who has re
cently given a very valuable children's
annex to the hospital, and another lady
whose name he was not at liberty to men
ticn had assured him that they would
give $1000 apiece rather than have a bene
fit for Fabiola at the racetrack.
Several other ministers expressed the
same sentiments, and It was decided to do
everything possible to let it be known
that the ministers objected seriously to
the Fabiola Derby day. The Alameda
County ministers present were: Rev. C.
R. Brown, Rev. Dr. E. R. Dille, Rev. E.
S. Chapman, Rev. A. T. Needham, Rev.
W. W. Si udder. Rev. B. J. Perry, Rev.
T. H. Robinson and Rev. L. J. Garber.
Next Wednesday evening at their reg
ular prayer-meeting these ministers will
cause their sentiments to be known.
The lady managers of Fabiola are doing
everything possible to make the Derby
day a success. Tickets are being sold ail
over the county, and a large attendance is
assured. One of the lady managers who
told of the action of the ministers
said: "I thought this matter was thor
oughly threshed out last year. I do not
think there Is anything new to be said.
If I remember rightly. Dr. Dille led the
opposition i" us last year, and somebody
prayed that it might rain on that occa
sion. It did rain, but whether in answer
to prayer or not 1 do not know. But I do
know that we received a substantial bene
fit tor Fnbiola. Rabbi Levy took our
part, and 1 presume that public opinion
is divided the same to-day as it was last
year. All the ladies on the board, I must
admit, are not unanimous on this propo
sition; but the majority of us arc. and
personally 1 cannot see any difference \x -
tween a gambler giving a check to Fabi
ola or putting one on a church plate.
I hope it will be a glorious day and that
there will be a large attendance, for Fa
biola needs .nil the encouragement that
can be given it."
Passing Counterfeit Coin.
Joseph Ray and Thomas Phillips, wh>>
Rive their occupations a* waiters, wre
arrested yesterday morning by Policemen
McGee and Coleman on Turk street for
having counterfeit money in their posses
sion. The officers found that the two
men had been passing counterfeit half
dollars on saloon keepers in the "tender
loin district", and arrested them on Turk
street. When searched at the City Prison
Ray had three counterfeit half dollars in
his pockets and. Phillips two. Secret Ser
vice Agent Brown was notified and ques
tioned the men, as several plaster of
parls casts of half dollars were found in
tht^r rooms by the two officers, but he
could not get anything out of them.

AN ENTERTAINING SOCIAL.
The Pacific Coast Women's Press As
sociation Discusses "Incidents
of Travel."
There is always some distinctive feature
about the social meetings of the Pacific
Coast Women's Press Association that
renders these gatherings peculiarly in
teresting and instructive. At the gather-
Ing of the association yesterday afternoon
"Incidents of Travel" was the topic, and
most refreshingly was it handled. In
stead of a dry discussion, each of the
speakers told of some experience or ob
servation, thereby lending a personality
to their remarks which made them all the
more interesting. Those who spoke on
travel were: -Mrs. M. F. Grey, Miss Bessie
Riimsey, Mrs. Alice Klngsbury Cooley,
Mrs. W. A. Truesdell. Miss S. Hartman
and Mrs. E. M. North. Mrs. Abbie E.
Krebs, the president of the association,
presided at the meeting and introduced
the speakers.
In addition to the literary part of the
programme there was a piano solo by
Miss Katheiine Nolan and a vocal solo
by Miss Cornelia Stanley. Miss Rita Mar
chand recited a humorous poem by Miss
H. X. Skidmore. Among those who were
present were Mrs. Mary E. Hart, the
first vie? president of the association,
who has just returned from a six weeks'
visit to L.HB Angeles, and Mrs. E. F. Wel
ler of the same place, who is a visiting
member of the association.
TRACEY A FAVORITE
IN THE BETTING
WALTER WATSON WILL DECIDE
ON POINTS ONLY.
Olympic Club Will Hold the Finals
of the Welter-Weight on
Wednesday Evening.
At a meeting of the managers of Tracey
nnd Neill which was held yesterday Wal
ter Watson, formerly boxing instructor of
i the Olympic Club, was chosen to referee
i the fight which will be held this evening
in Woodward's Pavilion, as heretofore
! stated. The betting is in favor of Tracey,
i but Neill's friends will doubtless flood
'â  the poolbozes to-night with money, as
' they are confident that Neill is too husky
: a fighter for Tracey to whip by mere
Jabbing tactics.
The fact that Walter Watson has been
' selected referee is an evidence in itself
that the patrons of the game will get a
; run for their money to-night.
Tracey will be â¢ squired by Al Smith,
Arthur ' Walker and De Witt Nan Court,
and Neil will be seconded by H. Maginnis,
: Tim McGrath and Milton Hayes.
The Olympic Club will have a great

TWO VERDICTS.
Juror Patrick Kelly Files a Special
Opinion in the Inquest on
Christine Buttner.
The rare spectacle of a Coroner's Jury
rendering two verdicts In the c me case
at the same time was witnessed yesterday
at the inquest on .ne body of Mrs. Chris
tine Buttner, the demented widow who
cut her throat with a carving knife last
Baturday at her residence, 20U Taylor
street.
Clara Buttner, stepdaughter of the de
ceased, after telling the jury what she
had seen of the horrible act, said that
Mrs Buttner had brooded for a long time
over the delusion that Mr. and Mrs.
Kroeger held her responsible for the
death of their child. The child had be< n
placed in thr- care of Mrs. Buttner, and
died of cholera infantum. She had done
for the ehilil all that was In her power,
and the Kroegera had not even thought
of blaming her. Bul Bhe was under the
halucination that the Kroegers were ac
cusing her and talking about her. She
was continually afraid of being arrested.
Ml the jurors but one Bigned" a verdict
that the deceased bad committed Buicide
while temporarily Insane. Patrick Kelly,
a hatmaker of 51 Fifth street, returned a
verdict of suicide, with the recommenda
tion "that the Coroner censure Mrs. "Wolff
and Mr. Kroeger for the manner in which
they had persecuted the deceased by us-
Ing scandalous language about her/
Coroner Hill approved and signed the
maiority verdict, but declined to approve
of !\tr. Kelly's recommendation.
BOARD OF HEALTH.
Belief That Governor Gage Has Made
Up the SlÃte for Appointments.
There is widespread belief among the
politicians that Governor Gage has
finished his slate for the Board of Health,
but diversity of opinion exists as to the
names written thereon. It is paid that
Dr. Keeney, Pr. M<y< rs. I>r. Cooper and
Dr! Vorbet will be announced as the
board. It is known that a strong effort
is being made to induce the Governor to
appoint Dr. Peter A. Kearney, who was
defeated at the last election for Super
visor from the Seventh Ward. He carried
every precind in his ward, but certain
combinations against him in the Western
Addition which united the Young Men's
Institute and the Native Bons in favor of
Mr. Bylngton caused the doctor's undoing.
Kelly and Crimmins waited on the Gov
ernor at the Palace Hotel hist Sunday to
present Dr. Kearney's claims for a place
on the Board of Health, and it would be
no surprise if the requested recognition
â were granted.
RAILROAD EXTENSION.
Seven Hundred Men at Work on the
Santa Barbara Line.
Colonel George Stone of the firm of Mc-
Murtry & Stone, contractors for grading
the Santa Barbara extension of the
Southern Pacific, arrived in the city Sun
day night from the scene of the work.
The distance to be graded is fifty-one
miles. Owing to the ruggedness of the
country along the base of the Santa Ynex
mountains, the heavy work cannot be
finished short of eighteen months. Big
bridges and culverts must be put in, as
the river beds carry torrents of water in
the rainy w ason.
The distance from San Francisco to Los
Angeles, via San Tails Obispo and Santa
Barbara, is not less than that of the
route through the San Joaquin Valley and
across the Tehachapi from this city to
Los Angeles, but the grade of the lint
along the coast is nominal and trains
may be moved at a high rate of speed.
The contractors have now 700 men at
work between Surf and Elwood and the
force will be increased.
FUNERAL OF JUDGE BREEN.
Services Held at St. Agnes Church
and the Remains Taken to
San Juan.
Funeral services wore held over the re
mains of the late Judge J. F. Breen at
St. Agnes Church on Masonic avenue
yesterday, Rev. Father William Kirby
officiating. The pall-bearers were Judge
William P. Lawlor, William D. English,
P. J. Herein P. P. Deering. Thomas B.
Flynn ana Garret McEnerney. The re
mains were taken to the old home of
Judge Breen in San Juan, where final in
terment will take place to-day.
A Contralto's Suit.
The suit of Eunice West water against
the wardens, vestry and rector of Grace
Church to recover $15,001 damages for in
jury to her reputation as a contralto and
her health, was called by Judge Hunt yes
terday morning, but as the plaintiff waa
not ready to pay her jury fees the case
was continued until such time as the fair
singer deposits 134 for that purpose in
court Miss "Westwater was dismissed
from the choir of the church mentioned
contrary, she alleges, to the form, force
and effect of a contract entered into be
tween herself and the defendants. Hence
the suit for damages.
DR. CHAPMAN COMMENDED.
Superintendent of the Anti-Saloon
League Complimented by His
Brother Ministers.
"Resolved, That we congratulate the
people of the city of Berkeley upon the
Signal and glorious triumph won by them
at the polls on the 10th of this month, by
which their will was registered that the
saloon should be banished from that fair
<.ityâ the city of our State University.
"Resolved, Thai we congratulate Dr. E.
S. Chapman upon the successful cor.clv-
Blon of a years labors as superintendent
of the Anti-Saloon League, and thank him
especially for his most efficient, heroic
and self-sacrificing work, which made the
splendid result in Berkeley possible, and
we pledge him in the future, as in the
past, our prayers and active and practical
co-opemtion."
The above resolutions, introduced by the
Rev. Dr. Dille at the joint meeting of the
ministers of this city and BUrrounding
cities, held In the auditorium of the Y. M.
('. A. building yesterday morning, were
unanimously adopted.

George C. Adams. In a few fitting sen
tences he told why they had met, and
then introduced Dr. Chapman as the lion
of the occasion. Despite his age the lat
ter is wonderfully active. He told of the
hard strug^l'- the league had had and of
[he victories it had attained in Riverside
and Ventura counties, in Berkeley. San
Luis Obispo, Pomona, Redlamls, Petaluma
ami Pasadena.
Rev. Dr. Atkinson of Petaluma. Rev.
Dr. Dobbins of Berkeley, Rev. Frederick
Doane of this city. Rev. li. C. Brown of
Oakland, Dr. I'rmy and Rev. John A. B.
Wilson followed with commendatory
speeches.
ANTHRACITE COAL.
Judge Morrow Decides That It Must
Pay Duty if It Does Not Contain
Sufficient Fixed Carbon.
United States Judge Morrow yesterday
handed down an opinion in the matter of
the appeal of Charles P. Coles from a
ruling of the Collector of the Port and
from a ruling of the Board of General Ap
praisers of New York.
On July 24, 1897, Coles imported from
Swansea." Wales, a cargo of coal on the
British ship Muskoko. The Collector
classified it as containing less than 92 per
cent of fixed carbon and held that it was
therefore dutiable under the act of July
24. 1897, at the rate of 67 cents per ton.
The Board of General Appraisers upheld
the Collector. Judge Morrow decided
that coal of any description or name con
taining less than 92 per cent of fixed
in is liable to duty, while anthracite
coal containing 02 per cent or more fixed
carbon is duty free. He therefore upheld
the Collector and the Board of Apprais
ers.
Marine Firemen's Funds.
The preliminary examination of John
Dougherty, ex-treasurer of the Marine
Firemen's Union, charged with felony
embezzlement, was concluded before
Judge Conlan yesterday afternoon, and
th. Judge said he would deliver his de
cision this morning.
In the Divorce Court.
James L Pool has been granted a
divorce from Kittle Pool on the grounds
of cruelty and intemperance. Fannie E.
\very has sued Edward C. Avery for a
divorce, alleging failure to provide as a
cause of action.
Sons of Temperance to Meet.
The Grand Division ol the Sons of Tem
perance will meet this morning in Pythian
Castle ai 10 -â â¢lock. Business of impor
tance to the order will be transacted and
a full attendance Is requested.
An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Strui- of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by a method i
known to the California Fig Syrup j
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial j
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company j
printed on the front of every package.

SEWER SYSTEM
PROPOSITION IS
UNDER THE BAN
Question of Funds
May Defeat It.
ENGINEERS WANT THEIR PAY
POWER OF SUPERVISORS IS
QUESTIONED.
Transfer of Money While Creditors
Remain Unpaid May Precipitate
a Long and Acrimonious
Legal Controversy.
The Mayor and the Hoard of Supervis
ors have declared in favor of a bond Issue
to provide funds for the establishment of
an Improved sewer By stem, but there is a
strong probability that the question will
not be submitted to the people this year
on account of lack of funds to insure the
performance of tha necessary preliminary
work.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday I
passed to print an ordinance declaring the j
Intention of the board to appropriate the
sum of $20,000 for the purpose of fray
ing the expense of preparing the neces-
Bar} plane and estimates for the proposed
sewer system prior to the submission of
the question to the people. It is slated In
this ordinance, or resolution, that the
money cannot be appropriated for this
purpose until the end of the present fiscal
ynar. at which time a surplus in the
street lighting fund can be transferred
to the street fund and thus become avail
able, It Is on the question of the ability
of the board to transfer this money from
one fund to another as Intended thai the
whole question hinges.
Marsden Man eon and C. E. Grunsky,
who have been named as engineers to
conduct the work of perfecting the plans
for a sewer system and who are to be
paid $4000 each for their services, called
upon Auditor Wells yesterday and asked
his advice as to what course they should
pursue. They declared their unwilling- j
ness to proceed with i he work unless they I
were assured of compensation and they
wanted to know what prospect there was j
of setting the money that the Board of j
Supervisors promised to appropriate at
the end of the present fiscal year.
Auditor Wells informed them that there
was a large deficiency in the Street De- I
partment fund and that there are now in j
his hands many demands against that j
fund, some of them dating back as far as j
January of the present year, which re
main unpaid for lack of funds. The con
tractors who hold these demands have
been patiently waiting- for their money
with the understanding that at the end
of the fiscal year the surplus in the street
lighting fund would be transferred to the
Street Department fund and their de
mands against the latter fund would then
be audited and paid. The Auditor said
that if the Board of Supervisors entered
into new contracts for the use of this j
money with the knowledge that debts still
unpaid were left unprovided for the con- i
tractors would probably claim such act
on the part of the board to be Illegal and
would take such legal action as would
effectually tie up all of the funds Involved
In the controversy. So far as the engi
neers are concerned, the question is left
in so unsatisfactory a condition that it is j
likely they will refuse to go on with the [
work until they are given more substan- j
tial assurance that they will be paid for i
the labors they are expected to perform.
Following is the ordinance passed to print
by the Board of Supervisors yesterday:
Whereas, under section 4 of the muni
cipal Improvement act, approved March 19,
l^'.i, this board. contemplating permanent â 
public Improvements, the cost of which
Will be too great to be paid 'it of the
onlinnry annual income and revenue of the
municipality, is required to have plans and
estimates of the rust of such improvements
made prior to submitting the question of
issuing bonds at a special election to the j
qualified voters of this city and county; and
whereas, thin board hereby determine*
that the public Interests demand the eon- j
struction of main OUtlet sewers to promote
and improve the sanitary condition of the
city and county and insure drainage and
protection to property, and will provide at
the proper time for a special election, to
be held as soon after the plans and esti
mates of. cost are received as the provis
ions of the statute will permit; and
whereas, this board, in order to afford
the relief demanded by our citizens, is re
quired to take all preparatory steps to as
certain and determine the costs to be in
curred from an examination of the condi
tion as to defective sewerage of the pres
ent system, and in the additional construc
tion of main sewers In the various districts
now Buffering from a want of sewerage
fodlif and whereas, no appropriation
has been made this fiscal year for this pur
pose, but the condition of the street light
fund from the expenditures heretofore
made, and the limit of the amounts to be
p;ild monthly for the services of light
ing the public streets show that there will
be a surplus exceeding $40,000 unexpended
in said fund at the close of the fiscal
year; therefore,
Resolved, That this board hereby appoints
C S. Tllton. C. E. Grunsky and Marsden
Manson. civil engineers, to constitute a
board of engineers, whose duty it shall be
to prepare and submit plans and estimates
of the expense to be Incurred, and to that
end it Is necessary to oorrect the defects
and inefficiencies of existing sewers and to
prescribe the salient features of the sys
tem required for districts not now sew
ered; to determine the method of sewage
collection and disposal and the points of
outfall; to determine the location, size and
character of the main sewers for each of
the districts Into which the city Ib divided
by topographical features, and the mode
of delivering district sewage to the points
of the outfall; to recommend the order in
which- main sewers and works should be
constructed and to designate those which
should be constructed at once, with a
plan of the same; to make an estimate of
the cost Of constructing the main sewers
and works suggested for immediate con
struction, which plans and estimates must
be submitted and are hereby required to be
filed with this board on or before October
16, ISM.
Resolved, That the compensation to be
paid each of paid engineers is hereby fixed
at $4000. and the expenses necessitated by
such employment In the examination, sur
veys, compilation of data, preparation of
plans and estimates of expense and other
incidental expenses required by said board
of engineers Is hereby fixed at $8000, the
whole or so much of said appropriation to
be expended on said engineers as may be
necessary in their Judgment to obtain all
the Information required.

gineers herein appointed, the mm of $20,000,
to enable this work to be prosecuted and
completed as provided for, in defraying the
' expenses of the employment and Incidental

Resolved, That the Auditors Â»nd Treas
urer's attention is respectfully called to the
provisions of this resolution, and said of
ficers are further empowered and requested
to consider this appropriation as being
made bo that the demands for the Inci
dental expenses to be incurred by the said
Board of Engineers shall be audited and

this board and until such time In the
month of June when the transfer can be

recelve part payment of the compensation
herein provided, an follows: On July 3,

architects of the City Hall for use of the
Board of Engineers If necessary.
Resolved. That this board will hereafter I

The Call's Crusade
Against Vice Has
Again Brought
Good Re
sults.
ONCE more has public opinion
forced act/on on the part of
the Police Department, and
THE CALL'S crusade against
flaunting vice has again borne
fruit.
Three notorious gambling
houses â the Cafe Royal, at Fourth
and Market streets; Metropole,
823 Market street, and Palace sa
loon, 869 Market street â were
raided last evening, and a number
of frequenters of these debasers
of morals were taken to prison.
Months ago THE CALL began
its crusade, showing the perni
cious evils which were permitted
by a complaisant Police Depart
ment to debauch and corrupt the
youth and young manhood of San
Francisco. The vile dens of China
town, where illicit games were in
progress night and day, nere ex
posed, and the slave traffic of that
portion of the community shown in
such colors as to attract the at
tention of the entire city, and the
result was an upheaval in the per
sonnel of the Chinatown squad
and the constant raiding of the
dens.
Months ago attention was called
to the faro games running at
prominent hotels, and again public
opinion compelled action on the
part of the head of the Police De
partment.
The evils of racetrack gam
bling, with the terrible sequels of
crime in the business community,
resulting in defaulters, absconders,
fugitives from justice, murders
and suicides, were fully set forth
in THE CALL, and the entire com

Harry Wilson, the mulatto In the City
Prlsnn, positively Identified by two
women as the perpetrator of a bold rob
bery, and suspected by the police of any
number of others, denies that he is the
strangler who choked the lives out of two
women in this city several years ago be
fore he went to Denver to duplicate his
awful crimes. It would be difficult at
thi* late date, the police admit, to con
vict Wilson of these murders, even were
he guilty, but that they are making an
effort to fix something darker than rob
bery upon him could easily be gathered
last night by their actions. Chief Lets and
Captains Bohen and Seymour had the
man in the "sweat box" for an hour, and
during the day and night half a dozen
detectives were on the case.
More than this, an attempt was made
to throw a light on the record of the pris
oner that would be of no earthly us>- to
secure his conviction for robbery. Thomas
Young, who resides at 4407 Point Loboa
avenue, called at headquarters last nigh:
and after being closeted With Captain Bo
hen and Detective T. B. Gibson was taken
to the prison, where Wilson was brought
out so that thr> visitor could have a look
at him. The reason for this was that
Young had told the police that h>- was a
Deputy Sheriff at Placquemine, Iberville
Parish, La., in 1882, when a mulatto named
('â¢â¢ orge Wilson was hanged for the murder
of a woman. On the scaffold. Young said,
the condemned man had asserted his inno
cence, claiming that he was being sacri

who had really committed the murder arid

Price.
The moment Young clapped eyes on
Harry Wilson last night he turned to De
tective Gibson and saJd: "That's the
man; he's the dead image of George AVil
son, the man 1 saw hanged." Later, to
a reporter for The Call, Young said that
he had been induced to call at police
headquarters from a conversation he had
had yesterday morning with John F.
Neely, a mining man of San Diego, at
present a guest at the (Jrtlden West Ho

to further the ends of justice by taking
such a course.
It was after the Identification of Wilson
as a twin to thf condemned man. whether
by birth or wonderful resemblance, that
the prison.-r was taken to the Chief's of
fice. The rumor had reached there that
J. N. E. Wilson, tho attorney for the man
held in custody, had remarked that he
was of the impression that his client had
been arrested some years ago for some
theft from a woman. A search of the
records convinced Chii f Leea that such
was not the case, and he remarked "This
fellow has never been arrested hen- "
Chi-f Lees said that Wilson admitted that
lie was a poker player, who bad been in
Humboldt and Monterey counties Some
seven years ago he was in Louisiana with
lace horses. Wilson claims to be 35 years
of age and says he was born in Kentucky
"The women who saw the Spaniard'"'
said Chief Lees last night, after Wilson
had been returned to his cell, "have made
many changes of renldence sine,. t nf .

demnation from the decent element
of the city that the proprietors of
the phonograph parlors were ar

THE CALL began the fight for
decency and morality and waged it
alone for months, being sustained
and supported by the moral ele
ment of the city, headed by minis

Powell street. On Thursday night, shortly

A dispatch received last night from
Denver reads as follows: "Harry Wilson,
the mulatto under arrest in San Fran

the records of the police department
show. The police of this city say they
bave no reason to suspect that he is the

Carroll on charges of incompetence, lack
of tact and scholarship.
There was a full board present when
the meeting was called and the members ;
got down tii business at once by demand
ing from the Superintendent the list of i
those who were booked for trial. There j
were threeâ Kilpatrick, who prevented
the progress of his trial a week ago by
writs of prohibition from the Superior
Court; Dr. Wiedeman, who was too ill
to appear, and Miss Carroll. Miss Carroll
was ready and asked that her case bo
brought before the board In executive ses

the boardroom was cleared of every one
but the defendant and her attorney, F.
P. Deering, and the board went into com
mittee of the whole.
There were five witnesses examined,
and their examination occupied from !â¢ '
o'clock until 12. Then the committee of
the whole adjourned and reported that I
the charges had not been sustained by the
evidence. The report was adopted by the
board without dissent.
The charges were brought by Joseph
O'Connor, principal of the Mission High
School, of which the accused teacher is
vice principal.
When the board adjourned it was until
next Monday evening, when the charges
against the other teachers mentioned will
be brought up and perhaps tried. The
trial of Kilpatrick is expected to be a
long one.

people began to feel that decency

The Examiner then joined the
crusade and gave able and welcome
assistance to THE CALL in its
cleansing efforts. Following close
ly on the lines laid down by THE
CALL, the Examiner did valiant
work in the interests of decency,
and last night's raids were the
beginning of the end of the reign
I of evil in San Francisco.
Acting under instructions from Chief
Lees, Sergeant Conboy, Officers Tyrrell
and Esola and posse began their evening's
work. They were all in citizen's dress,
and although recognized by many hang
ers-on about the places afterward raided,
the alarm was not given, as it was
thought they were on a peaceful mission.
Sergeant Conboy entered the Cafe Royal
and proceeded back to the apartment set
aside for gaming. He watched the men at
the tables, and after satisfying himself
that the "dealer" had taken a percentage
out of the game, he placed the latter and
the men who were gambling under arrest.
When he ordered them into custody the
gamblers started up in affright and tried
to escape. Those playing at the other
tables thinking they, too, would be taken
to prison, made a dash for liberty. Ser
geant Conboy and his assistants made no
effort to detain the fleeing gamblers, be
ing satisfied with those- seated at the un
fortunate table. The latter were hustl.-d
out to the curbstone and placed in the
waiting patrol wagon, along with the
green baize table and other evidence. F.
H. Ryder; Joseph Barry, the game-keeper;
Peter Hayes, Thomas Sonogni and A.
Austin were charged with violating sec
tion 330 of the Penal Code. H. Hornlein,
one of the proprietors of the Cafe Royal,
! having been informed of the visit paid' his
I place by the police, voluntarily visited the
City Prison a half hour aver the raid and
surrendered himself. A similar charge
was placed against him. He put up the
necessary cash bail for the men who
played in his house, and in doing so stated'
that he was protecting his fellow prison
ers.
Hardly had the patrol wagon driven
away from the Cafe Royal when the gam
blers resumed thHr interesting pastime as
if nothing had disturbed them in their ef
forts to win a -ortune.
Officer Esola and posse visited the Met
ropole saloon, which is under the Midway
Plai.sance. Esola duplicated ii.s superior
officer's action by waiting for one of the
players to cash his chips, and he placed
the men under arrest. The table, the
cards and the chips were gathered in,
and another load of players was
carted to the City Prison. The men who
were booked were Frank Winn, \V. Park
er, C. Sipe, Proprietor L. Hanson, Alfred
Berrard, Julius Kline, "Budd" Williams,
and John Mason, the. game-keener.

prisoners.
Setsoont Coogan and posse attempted
to raid the "Our House" at 993 Market,
owned by B. Conway, but before they
could carry their intention into effect
their pr< sence was discovered and no ot
