BAD TERMS
The Story Told by a Span

respondent.
He Also Makes Some Serious
Charges Against the Admin
istrative Morality of
Americans.
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
BARCELONA, Jan. 28. â The Manila correspondent of
the Diario says he has discovered that the relations between
Major General Otis and Rear Admiral Dewey are most
strained, owing to the profound rivalry which exists between the
land and sea forces of the United States in the islands.
"The administrative morality of the Americans," says the
correspondent, "is below par. The gambling hells of Manila are
taxed $1200 each, and the police are highwaymen, who make ar
bitrary arrests and then demand from $10 to $20 each for the re-
lease of prisoners."
The correspondent further declares that the Americans
have monopolized all the trade and swamped the markets with
their products, rendering European competition impossible. As
an instance of this, he alleges that California wines are sold in
Manila as genuine Bordeaux.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2S â The
Call correspondent inter
viewed Agoncillo to-day. He
was apparently very anxious
about the Senate's action on
the treaty. Whether he has any hope
that the treaty -will be rejected, or
whether he is anxioiwHto secure definite
Information fn advance concerning- the
Senate's probable action is not clear,
but it Is certain that he in turn seeks
to ir.tervlew every correspondent who
approaches him.
The Call correspondent was reliably
informed to-day that Agoncillo and his
party have already made their arrange
ments to go to Canada when the peace
treaty is ratified. This would seem to
Indicate that the Filipinos are resolved
to fight. It will be remembered that
the Spanish Minister departed for Can
ada after being given his passports.
Agoncillo and his confederates are
shadowed wherever they go by treas
ury detectives. This is very annoying,
and they are naturally suspicious of all
strangers who approach them. Senor
Lopez of the party, when handed The
Call representative's card to-day scru
tinized the reporter closely and ex
amined the card carefully and then held
a whispered consultation with one of
his associates.
Agoncillo cannot understand how his
telegram to Aguinaldo became public.
He inquired at the Western Union office
to-day, through one of his paid em
ployes, whether it was usual for a tele
gram filed with that company to be
made known to others and was in
formed that the Western Union rules
of secrecy were rigid and inviolate.
The Filipinos have plenty of money.
They live in fine style at the Arlington
Hotel. They are greatly impressed
with the beauties of the national capi
tal, especially the imposing buildings.

*Â° land, is a niece by marriage' to the
88 man whoâ according to the lady â went

other members of the English-speaking
race and to promote their co-operation
in the great work of civilization, which
appears to be the mission of the Anglo-
Saxon race."
Speaking of the Government's im
perial policy, Mr. Chamberlain said:
"Providence shapes our ends and in
tends us to be a great governing power,
conquering in order to civilize, admin
ister and develop vast' areas of the
world's surface,, primarily- to our ad
vantage, but to their own advantage as
well.
"As to the result of this mission hith
erto an impartial witness, Ad

out driving.
"Jane, do you know what I am go
ing to do with you, that is, if you will
let me?" said the ardent millionaire,
â¢ with n well defined tremulo.
"What?" responded Jane.
"I'm going to marry you." And
those are the fateful words that will
probably cost the Oakland capitalist
a very neat sum.
The millionaire's love ran smoothly
but for ten short days, lie proposed
on November 10; called daily to see
his loved one until November 15, when
he took her on a long drive, during
which they discussed their plans for
the future. Then Miss Maizie Nicholl,
eldest unmarried daughter of the aged
swain, took a hand in the matter and
declared her papa's engagement off.
Miss Hodge, when seen In regard to
the matter of her contemplated suit
against Millionaire Nicholl for breach
of promise, freely admitted the truth
of the report and made the following
statement:
"I became engaged to John Nicholl
on November 10. For more than one
year he has been wanting to put the
question to me, and I finally decided
to give him the opportunity. On the
9th of November Mr. Nicholl called
upon me, and as he was getting into
his buggy, preparatory to leaving,
said in the presence of Mr. and Mrs.
Berry: 'Jane, I think you need a com
panion. Will you come out with me
to-morrow and talk It over?' I an
swered 'Yes.' The nature of his re
mark was such that I had ti; have an
explanation.
"The nett day he called early, and
when I opened the door for him he
said: 'Get your duds on and come on
with me.' We went riding together.
We had gone but a Httle distance from
the house when he said: 'Jane, do
you know what I am going to do
with you? That la. if you will let me
do it?' And when I answered 'what?'
he said. 'Marry you.' 'Yes?' I
queried, and then he said, 'Didn't
you know that I wanted to marry
you? I thought for some time that
you did. What do you say about it?'
'Well. I think I had better marry you,'
I answered, and he embraced me and
said. 'God bless us in the union.'
"We spoke about his children and he
remarked he did not want to sacrifice
his daughters to his comfort. Hester
Nicholl had said she considered it her
duty to remain with him and he sup
posed Maizie felt the same way.
"We laid plans for the girls. Maizie
was to return to Paris to study art
and Hester was to marry, as Mr.
Nicholl felt she wished to. Mr. Nicholl

WILL FIGHT TO
SAVE WRIGHT
FROM DISGRACE
Burns' Lieutenants in the Assembly Have
Received Their Orders.
STRONG EFFORTS TO BE MADE MONDAY
A Pretty Fight Promised When Attempts Are Made to
Eliminate the Severe Recommendations of the
Committee of Investigation.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 28.â The report of the
Assembly investigating committee is
not to be considered until Monday
afternoon at 2:30 o'clock. This was de
cided to-day by a vote of the Assem
bly in accordance with an agreement
entered into between the Burns and the
Grant forces. The agreement by which
the consideration of the report was de
layed extends no further than the post
ponement, but the Burns men hope to
be able to effect some combination ben
eficial to themselves before a vote is
taken. This hoped-for combination
contemplates some method whereby the
disgraced Speaker, Howard E. Wright,
may be saved from the consequences
of his own infamous acts.
The fact that the investigating com
mittee recommended that Wright be
either deposed as Speaker or expelled
from the Assembly has had the effect
of causing Burns to issue orders that
Wright is to be saved at whatever cost.
Dibble of San Francisco and Johnson
of Sacramento have been named as the
men who are to carry out Burns' or
i ders on the floor of the Assembly. They
'â  will attempt to secure the adoption of
| such amendments to the report on Mon
: day as will eliminate the severe recom
! mendations which the committee saw
| fit to propose as a just punishment for
j the grave offenses of which they found
Wright guilty.
Whether the Grant forces will oppose
any such action on the part of the
Burns followers remains to be seen. It
is certain, however, that the followers
of Bulla and Barnes, as well as the
minority members of the Assembly, will
fight any attempt on the part of the
Burns men to shelve the report of the
committee. To-day the Grant men also
say that they will fight the proposi
tion made by Burns' followers that
Wright be whitewashed. Unless some
change is effected before Monday after
noon a very pretty contest will be wit
nessed on the floor of the Assembly.
Burns' lieutenants frankly admit
that Wright Is guilty of all and more
than has been charged against him.
but they say that he alone should not
be punished when others are equally
guilty. They decline to say who the
other members are who are guilty of
the offenses charged against Wright,
but they insist that Wright should be
protected. That this view of the case
does not fit in with the opinions held
by a majority of the members of the
Assembly is apparent. This feeling is
so strong that unless Burns can suc
ceed in inducing Grant to believe that
his interest lies in "standing: in." the
vote Monday afternoon will be in fay.or
of the acceptance of the report of the
committee.
Although the consideration of the re
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
port had been made a special order for
11 o'clock this morning, the matter was
disposed of before that hour. The
members of the committee found that
they had made a mistake in findine
that Wright had promised his vote to
Bulla in return for Bulla's support of
Wright for Speaker. This fact was not
brought out in evidence, but the mis
take of the committee was a natural
one, as it Is well known that Wrierht
did make such a promise. The failure
of the committee to secure testimony
on this point was not due to lack of
diligence, but rather to foreetfulness.
At any rate, the point was immaterial,
but Assemblyman Melick, in a spirit
of fairness, offered an amendment mak
ing the necessary correction. Dibble
moved that the amendment to the re
port of the committee be printed in the
journal, and that the consideration of
the whole matter be postponed until
Monday afternoon. This was opposed
by several members of the committee,
but as postponement had been agreed
upon in advance by a majority of the
members, the motion finally prevailed.
It is again asserted to-night that
Wright may resign the Speakership of
the Assembly on Monday.
The House will convene at 11:30 a. m.
on that day and as soon as the pre
liminaries have been gone through it
is possible that Wright will rise and
offer his resignation as Speaker o-f the
body.
But with the resignation, if it is sub
mitted, will go an explanation in writ
ing, which Wright will ask to have
printed in the journal.
That resignation will set up his claim
that he is an innocent man; that his
actions have been misinterpreted and
misconstrued; that he is an honest man'
hounded by a prejudiced press and per
sonal enemies.
But Wright, so it is claimed, will rec
ognize the report of the committee fur
ther, to this extent: He will cite the
fact that the report has placed him in
a position where he feels that he can
not longer, as an "honorable" man
possessing due regard for his friends
on the floor, whose sympathy he be
lieves he has, serve as the presiding
officer of the Assembly.
It is reported further that this after
noon some very strong pressure was
brought to bear upon Wright to force
him to resign and thereby save himself
from bein. the subject of bitter com
ment in debate on the floor, which wil!
surely result if an attempt is made to
let him off with a mere resolution of
censure, which the committee of in
vestigation has specifically stated is
not adequate punishment for him.
The last heard to-night was that
[ Wright wanted until to-morrow even2
INCIDENTS OF THE DAY AT SACRAMENTO.
A LIGHT VOTE
AND NO CHANCE
$ CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 28.â The monotony
O of the joint Senatorial ballot was broken this morning. UJysses S. Grant

S with young Works of San Diego during the time when his remaining
Q supporters were reading those thankful telegrams from Washington.
There was no change in the v< te, however. Being Saturday and the
S last legislative day of the week, there were, of course, more absentees

ing to form his judgment as to what
he would do.
If Wright does not resign, as he h^s
by some people been advised to do, the
disposition the Assembly is to make of
the report of the investigating com
mittee will certainly cause a debate
that is liable to be bitter and long.
If Mr. Wright passes over his resig
nation and explanation before the
House acts or has a chance to act, then
the report of the committee will simply
be adopted and the committee dis
charged. But if Wright fails to retire
as Speaker, then Mr. Melick of Los An
geles, a member of the Investigating
committee, will, at the proper time in
the discussion of the report, offer a
resolution deposing Wright from the
Speakership. Mr. Melick will not do
this if any other man of courage can
be found who is willing to perform the
duty. The members of the committee
propose to stand by their report to a
man and defend it on the floor. Cosper
is a fair talker and so is Sanford and
other members.
Should Wright wait for the resolution
of deposition to be offered before he
resigns it is understood that the Grant
men. unless they change their plans be
tween now and Monday morning, will
ask to be excused from voting on the
resolution on the ground that Daniel
M. Burns and his supporters made
Wright Speaker and that therefore
upon the colonel's shoulders should rest
the responsibility of his either continu
ing as Speaker or ordering him from
the chair.
But the Grant men cannot avoid this
responsibility. They can be compelled
to vote, unless consent is given for
them to take a neutral stand. The
Grant men will, so it is claimed, have
as their leaders on the floor during the
contest over the report of the commit
tee RadclifC of Santa Cruz, McDonald
of Alameda and Works of San Diego.
They expect to do some talking, and
It is quite evident that the Grant men
â will stand together in whatever they
do.
The Bulla men are all now quite en
thusiastic in favor of supporting the
committee, but the Burns men, under
the direction of their foxy leaders, are
adroitly working some scheme. If
they attempt to uphold Wright it will
Interfere materially with a plan which
they have on hand to break the dead
lock. That plan is to have Republican
committees throughout the various
counties of the State pass a resolution
asking their representatives in the Leg
islature to consent to participate in and
be bound by a Republican legislative
caucus. That means, of course, Burns'
election. But if by the vote of the
Burns contingent Wright is continued
In the Speaker's chair after he has been
found guilty by the committee of in
vestigation then the colonel will be
held personally responsible by the in
dignant army of Republican voters
throughout the State, who look upon
Wright as having disgraced the honor
able position he holds. If Burns saves
Wright these voters will not.be willing
to further any scheme whereby the
eaid Dan will land in the Senate of the
United States as a representative of
California. If Burns sustains Wright
it will mean the positive defeat of the '
caucus resolution in nearly every
county in the State except those that
have already indorsed Burns.
JOHNSON WORKED HIS
CARTOON BILL THROUGH
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 28.â The Johnson-Works
cartoon bill failed of reconsideration
this morning when It came up before
the Assembly pursuant to the notice
given yesterday by Cowan of Santa
Rosa. The vote stood 41 to 17 against
It, and, as on yesterday, when it came
up on its final passage, it was the
"push" that Grove Johnson has gath
ered round him by threats of legisla
tive retaliation that did the work.
From the day the bill first made its
appearance, Johnson has given all of
his time to this unique scheme he has
hatched to satisfy his own petty spite.
He has assiduously "worked" every one
on the floor who is willing to be seen
talking to him, and by virtue of the
Influence he swings as chairman of the
Judiciary Committee he has succeeded
In gathering enough of a following to
accomplish his personal ends. John
son however, has not stopped at using
his influence as chairman of the Judi
ciary Committee. He has come openly
out on the floor and traded votes with
other members who have bills on the
file they want passed. When he has
not been able to trade he has threat
ened. He approached Cowan of Santa
Rosa and told him that if he did not
vote with him he need not hope to get
the bills passed that he now has be
fore the House. He told the same thing
to McDonald of Alcmeda and to Rad
cliff of Santa Cruz, and he, or his fol
lowers, have made the same threat to
other members on the floor.
When the bill came un this morning
it found no lack of opponents. All it
lacked was votes. Melick, Cosper and
Burnett of the investigating commit
tee, who have been cartooned and cari
catured to the limit during the past
few days, all spoke openly and at length
against it. Cowan of Santa Rosa
opened the fight with one of his char
acteristically sty ly speeches, and Fe
liz of Monterey, who has a voice and a
brain of his own, followed him. Owen
Wade of Napa, who has been pitf.ured
more generously than any other man
on the floor, also lent his voice against
Uui measure, but to no avail; the gang
| that Johnson had intimidated into vot
' ing for his measure on the day before
stood with him still, and the result
showed a difference of only three votes
from the previous day's record. The
bill got the constitutional majority and
it will make its next appearance before
the Senate.
SUNDAY OBSERVANCE
IN THE ASSEMBLY
CAIJ. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 28.â Sunday observance pe
titions were in order in the Assembly this
morning. There was a whole grist of
them handed up to Clerk Kyle, most of
them from the sunny southern section of
the State, where sweltering orange groves
and the fragrance of their blossoms burn
out ambition for baseball on Sundays and
lull to sleep the desire for the traps and
double-barreled shotgun. The petitions
pray for the enactment of laws that will
prohibit sports and active pastimes on the
Sabbath, effect the rigid observance of
the day by the business guild and put a
stop to everything save the harnessing of
the family horse at church time and the
inevitable Sunday dinner.
Conrey of Los Angeles handed in one
from that county that carried 1420 names;
Burnett of San Luls-Obispo County offer
ed one with 40 names: works of San
Diego had 22 signers; Meserve of San
Bernardino had 730; Feliz of Monterey,
who yesterday introduced a resolution
ahollshing Sunday In everything save its
history, handed up one with 26 names, and
Melice of Orange and Riverside had one
from each county. The Riverside list had
46 names, the Orange list 1352. They
were all placed on file.
The better part of the morning was
taken up with the supplementary report
of tho committee on investigation and the
rather warm debate that ensued when the
Johnsi.n-Works cartoon bill came up for
the reconsideration moved by Cowan of
Santa Rosa. Reconsideration was voted
down by a vote of 41 to 17.
Senate joint resolution 10 relating to the
Nicaragua canal came up on the special
order tile and Wade of Napa made a.
strong speech in favor of its passage, but
Camtnettl of Amador again called atten
tion to the fact that it made no reference
to the 1 desire of this State to have the
canal built and operated by the Govern
ment, and ho moved to so amend the
resolution that it would ask for the build
ing of the canal by the Government and
the operation of it by the Government
and not under its auspices, as originally
provided. The amendment was carried
and the resolution was ordered back to
the printer.
Knighta of Sacramento introduced a
resolution which provided that the ser
geant-at-arms of the Assembly should be
empowered to purchase the flags now
hanging in the Assembly chamber at a
coat not to exceed $3S. It was so ordered
and the Assembly quieted down to await
the arrival of the Senate at the bar of the
House for the daily joint ballot. After
that was finished adjournment was
taken on motion of Dibble until the regu
lar hour on Monday morning.

MRS. GRANT APPRECIATES
SUPPORT FOR HER SON
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2S.â Every one of the twenty-eight members^ of the Legis
lature who have been voting for Grant this morning received the following telegram:
It Is undoubtedly true that every supporter of Mr. Grant feels very proud of the above telegram he has re
ceived from the wife of the great commander. They will, almost to a man, preserve them as mementoes to be
handed down In their families to future generations.
One Grant man from Northern California, whose further support of Grant was a subject of doubt, said:

To Increase Attorney's Fees.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 28.â An endeavor was made
in the Senate this morning to strike out
that rule which limits fees of attorney in
case of contested legislative seats to $200
for fees for the sitting member and $100
for the contestant.
Senator St ration moved to strike it out
and explained that the Dennery-Ashe con
test had been on before the Election Com
mittee for two weeks and the fee allowed
under the rule was not sufficient com
pensation for service rendered.
Senators Dickinson, Burnett and Smith
opposed the amendment and Senator Da
vis favored It.
Finally Senator Stratton withdrew his
motion to amend the joint rules and they
were adopted.
After they had been adopted Senator
Shortridge said that It was all folly to
tiHk about paying attorneys $1 per day
just :is sheepherders and prune growers.
The Senator added that he contemplated
entering the profession himself and he did
not propose to stand idly by and see its
members poorly paid.
The understanding is that the attor-
neys in the Dennery-Ashe contest are to
receive special consideration as to their
fees. This will he sought by a suspension
of the rules under a two-thirds vote.

other hills of that character that have yet

licensed pool-selling. The bill also pro
hibits pool-selling generally, except on

STRONG OPPOSITION

Possible.
Stratton Fully Explains the Measure and the
Necessity for It in an Article Written
for The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 28.â Senator -Stratton's
bill "providing for and concerning the
election of delegates to nominating con
ventions of political parties at elections,
designated as primary elections" was
before the Senate this morning on sec
ond, reading.
It was plairjly evidenced by the .pol
icy and course pursued by certain Sen
ators that the bill is' going to meet with
strong opposition. Senator Shortridge
announced that he would not support
It, and it was given out that Martin
Kelly and Phil Crimmins could see no
reform in the measure.
Senator Cutter proposed an amend
ment which was really the only impor
tant one that was suggested. His
change would make the necessary ex
pense in holding all State, district and
local primaries a charge, not upon the
county or city, as provided for in the
bill, but upon the State.
Senator Cutter's argument waa that
the bill would be of benefit only to the
more populous counties of the State
about, seven In number. The remain
ing had no need for the bill and its
provisions. This being the case, the
State should pay all the charges and
expense incurred in holding primaries
under the reform law proposed, and not
burden fifty counties in which the law
was not required.
A number of unimportant amend
ments were adopted and it was then
decided to have the bill, with all
amendments, passed and proposed and
to be proposed printed with the bill and

on Monday the measure to be the sub
ject of further consideration.
Senator Stratton has written for The
I Call the following article relative to the
i bill:
â I I have been requested to give my views
relative to pending legislation affecting
suffrage and the purification of primary
and general elections.
My connection with this matter ha 3
been without sentiment, and I have en
deavored to look at the questions involved
from a practical standpoint. The subject
is. while somewhat technical, an impor
i tant and interesting one. The enactment
j of a new primary election law is called
! for by a great majority of the citizens of
I the State, regardless of party affiliations.
The proposed law now reported favorably
by the joint Senate and Assembly Elec
tions Committee embraces in its pro
visions five salient features. The bill is
in its term* and operation both simple
and inexpensive. All of the primaries of
the various political parties are held at
the same time and place, respectively.
These elections are guarded by the same
provisions and safeguards as apply in
cases of general elections. They are under
the control of the State and the applica
tion is made of the Australian ballot sys
tem.
In addition to this it has been the aim
of the measure to prevent frauds as well
as to penalize them. Experience has
shown that to merely punish an offense
does not. as to primary elections, correct
the evil; abuses must be made impossible
as well as punished as felonies if perpe
trated.
It is to be hoped that the friends of this
measure will in large part disregard im
material objections as to the details of
the bill and will unite in urging its
passage. in view of the great good to re
sult therefrom. It seems to be, and I
think properly, considered that One of the
dangers to the republic lies in the primary
election system and that a reform should
well begin there.
In addition to this a second measure
pending provides in detail for the punish
ment of each and every offense against
the provisions of the primary election bill.
This, therefore, would insure not only
prevention, but punishment as weil.
Another matter connected closely with
this subject is that of a change in our
system of registration, whereby the same
will be not only simplified but rendered
much less expensive.
One of the demands of the State seems
further to be the adoption of some voting
machine which will prevent frauds in the
count as well as in the casting and tabu
lation of the vote.
In view of the fact that the merits of
the respective voting- machines have not
been sufficiently tested a bill has been In
troduced providing for the appointment
of a commission, consisting of the Gover
nor. Attorney General and Registrar of.
Voters of San Francisco, whose duty It
will be to employ practical mechanical
experts and to exhaustively test all votingr
machines submitted.
The commission Is authorized and di
rected to manufacture not less than five,
nor more than ten, of all machines of such,
design as commend themselves for the
experiment, so that at the next general
election in San Francisco and elsewhere
If desired these voting machines may be
put to a practical test, whereby all voters
who desire may informally cast their bal
lots by or through them. This will pre
clude the chance of any improper report
or manipulation, and will be so open as to
be above suspicion or opportunity of
fraudulent manipulation.
The commission will thereupon be re
quired to report the result of their ex
periments to the Legislature, together
with contracts which they are obliged to
secure from patentees, showing the exact
cost to the State of the adoption of any
particular machine. There will be there
fore, an open, practical test, and the cost
of the machines will he known before the
Legislature shall be asked to act
"\\ c can afford to wait two year* for
an innovation of this kind, and the\imÂ«
consumed in the meanwhile will not have
been lost.
There are other technical measures con
nected with elections now pending which
need not be gone into.
It seems unfair for the public to con
nect any one individual too hastily with
reforms of this kind to the exclusion of
other officials and citizens, regardless of
party, who are assisting in this movement
and are lending their hearty co-operation
to the enactment of these necessary laws.

Armory Rents Bill Passed.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 28.â Senator Dickinson's
bill to provide for the payment of armory
rents of the National Guard was finally
passed by the Senate this morning 1 .
Senator Bulla objected to the manner in
which the amounts due were to be ascer
tained by a special detail of the National
Guard. He thought the adjutant general
should determine the amount of the
claims and that a special detail to do the
work was not needed.
The bill was passed, however, by a vote
of 24 to 5.WRIGHT LOST TO

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- ]
MEMO, Jan. The spectacle of j
. Howard Wright presiding over the de- â 
' liberations of the Assembly to-day has
caused his few remaining friends to
dejDlore his utter lack of shame. Be- i
lore the charges against him were in- I
vestigated he had the thin excuse of !
â¢ Saying that the accusation against his
Integrity were newspaper assertions. |
Even then, had he possessed a single '
Jt>t of moral sensibility, he would have j
refused to take his place as presiding]
officer while the accusations were con
; fronting him. To the amazement of
his few apologists he took his place at
the Speaker's desk to-day after a com- ;
mittee of the House had rendered a
report which, in effect, recommends ,
his expulsion.
; The transgressor in money transac- j
tions who seeks to lead an honest life
. .makes restitution of money dishonestly
'obtained as a preliminary step to prove
the sincerity of his repentance. Wright
appears to be destitute of shame and
..sorrow. There is less sympath.
him to-day than there was yesterday.
His brazen effrontery in going to the
Speaker's desk was an insult to the
Assembly, and many of the members
are in v frame of mind to resent it. He
might as well have said to every mean- ;
jcjer ably, "I did take
Grant's money, and you would have
done the same thing it" the opportunity
to take it had been presented to you as
it was to me."
The Senatorial situation will remain
unchanged until next Tuesday and
perhaps longer. There are no indica
tions to-night that the ballot in joint
assembly next Monday will differ
the ballot cast to-day. The Grant men
have again n stand together
as long as Grant is in the field as a
cand ih<* Sc-natorihip. Grant >

There is considerable comment to
night regarding the telegrams sent by
M>. Grant to the ioyai supporters of
The impression obtains here j
that the suggestion to send the tele- j
. grams emanated frum the Grant camp '

This is the first introduction of the j

urging the latter to use her influence j
to prcmute the election of U. S. Grant j
Jr. to th-r Senate. Reference was made
in the letter to the warm friendship j
which had existed between General
Grant and Leland Stanford. It la
that Mrs. Stanford was deeply touched \
by the letter and was on the point of i
advocating the election of Grant, but I
was so earnestly advised by her law- i
yers to refrain from interference in the ;
struggl- that she did not respond to i
Mrp. Grant's wishes. The information 1
published then because The
Call did nut desire to bring the ladiea j
into the contest. Mrs. Grants message !

tion devoutly to be wished by Colonel
Burns. Every hour adds strength to
the belief that the colonel's campaign
can make no further progress in the
bright light of day, and therefore the
influences of a dark caucus are needed
to give it headway.
He has tried bluffing, boasting and
persuasion of the smoothest sort, but
there is such an open and widespread
public sentiment against his election to
thf Senate that his cause cannot be
advanced by the legitimate methods of
a Senatorial campaign. In a caucus
where the secret ballot could be intro
duced and the methoa sprung of drop
ping the lowest man on each ballot, the
colonel, by stealth, might get the ad
vantage of other candidates and ob
tain the caucus nomination. The paper
calling a caucus has not yet been
passed around for signatures.
The colonel has been sounding all
the depths and shallows of the Leeis
lature to ascertain if the caucus boat
could be navigated, but he is not satis
fled that the trip can be successfully
accomplished. In the Burns camr> the
feeling exists that a caucus could be
had if the Grant forces could be dis
integrated.
Thf> Buila men are confident that the
breaking of the Grant camp would not
give Burns a sufficient number of votes
to insure the success of a caucus
scheme.
General Barnes' heroic eleven sup
porters are serene and steady. They are
confident that the general is really the
first choice of a majority of the mem
bers of the Legislature, and as soon as
peculiar obligations are discharged the
voting for Barnes will begin and con
tinue until he is elected' Senator. Many
members frankly admit that the gen
eral is their second choice. The eleven
stalwart supporters of General Barnes
represent every section of California
but the metropolis from which the gen
eral hails. It is cited as a remarkable
fact significant of the domination of
bosses or boodle that the people of San
Francisco, who are largely In favor of
General Barnes' election to the Senate,
cannot find one man of the San Fran
cisco delegation to express their wishes.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 25.-Assemblyman Knights
of Sacramento added a supplement to-day
to the bill which he recently introduced,
making an appropriation of J59.500 for the
building of a mansion for the Governor
The supplement provides for the living
expenses of the executive and further
provides that such expense shall bÂ« paid
out of the genera! appropriation. The bill
directs that the renewal of furniture, the
pay of necessary servants and other ex
penses shall be jpaid out of the general
appropriation. No reason appears in the
bill why the cost of renewed furniture
should not be paid by special appropria
tion â¢when necessary." As it is, it leaves
the choice of amount and quality solely to
the occupant of the Gubernatorial man
sion. The bill is in the hands of the Com
mittee on Ways and Means.

MUCH-WANTED CONVICT.
Murder Charge Hanging Over a Man
iSentenced for Burglary.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2S.â A convict
serving a term for burglary in a peni
tentiary of this State is wanted in Ne
vada to answer to a charge of murder.
The Governor of Nevada has made a
requisition vn Governor Gage for the
prisoner, but the Governor of the com
monwealth cannot see how he can com-
ply with the demand for the release
of the burglar. If the Governor of
Nevada wUI be patient and wait until
the California term for burglary ex
pires, the . prisoner may then be ar
rested here and sent to Nevada, on
proper requisition, to be tried for the
crime of murder.
Quarles Has a Good Chance.
MADISON. Wi?.. Jan. 28.â Another
week has closed without any change in
the Senatorial deadlock. Two ballots
were taken in open caucus to-day and
one in joint assembly, without any ma
terial change. The talked-of combina
tion of the field against Quaries is
looked upon as possible as the Mil
waukee man is said to be the second
choice of many supporters of the op
posing candidates. If Quarles continues
to hold his present strength over till
Monday the chances for taking the
prize would seem to greatly favor him.

NEW YORK. Jan. 2S.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Only President McKinley ;
stands to-day between Brigadier Gen- j
eral Eagan, commissary general, and j
dismissal from the military service of
the United States. Without delay the j
court signed this morning its verdict, j
the text of which was made public In
the Herald this morning, and Lieuten- i
ant Colonel Davis, the judge advocate, j
delivered the record ana findlnsr to th'i
Secretary of War. The court then ad
journed sine die, and Lieutenant Col
onel Davis left to-night for West Point.
Tp', view of the order convening the j
court requiring it to try General Easran. \
"and such other persona as may' be :
ij^u&n*- ueloie it,' mere were some j
who thought and hoped developments'
would occur during the trial which
would enable it to bring General Miles
before the court. But it !s explained
at the department that the order was
in the usual form, and that even If the
administration had any charge to pre
fer against General Miles it cjul.i not
bring him before the Eagan court, be
cause of its final adjournment.
It was reported to-day that the
President, In view of the testimony
brought out during the 1 trial, would,
as has been done before, order a medi
cal board to determine whether General
Eagan was responsible for the state
ments he made, and, if the board should
so recommend, to retire him. No such
action was taken to-day, however, and
it is not thought that it is contemplat
ed. In any event, it seems to be the
general impression that the President
will mitigate the sentence.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28.â The War
Investigation Commission continued in
executive session all the forenoon, no
witnesses appearing. Several cases of
canned meats bearing the labels of Chi
cago packers arrived at the rooms of
the commission early in the day. but
the members denied all knowledge of
these new shipments, and would not
say whether or rot any fresh tests of
the meat were tr> be made.
WILL GREATLY AID
SUBMARINE SERVICE
France Possesses a Secret That May
Aid in Making Her Navy
Powerful.
PARIS, Jan. 28.â A1l eyes are centered
on the navy, particularly on the sub
marine branch of it. Opinions vary
about the value of the latest example
of this arm of the service, but hcp.?s
are certainly running high. People are
looking forward to the day when Eng
land can be called to toe the line by
France's fleet of submarine torpedo
boats, and the matter is being studi-.-d
out closely.
Another contribution was made to it
at Wednesday's meeting of the Acade
my of Sciences, where it was demon
strated by Dr. Labordi that Georges
Jaubert has discovered a chemical sub
stance enabling by a very simple opera
tion air to be purified again and again
in a closed space, all noxious elements
being eliminated as though by magic.
It is said that with between three and
four kilos of this new product one man
can bo enabled to live in a tiny space
hermetically sealed for twenty-four
hours. Experiments have been made
with animals in the first place, and then
with men. All were perfectly suc
cessful.
The Ministry of Marine is a|3o ex
perimenting with the Bubstacc-i in view
of using It in connection with sub
marine boats. Jules Verne's romances
seem on the point Â»>f becoming realities.

ss at any moment. gj
$ The party was composed of F. Riede, Harry Obitz and Phil and $

Capture and Con
fession.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN ANDREAS, Jan. 28.â In the Su
! perior Court at this place to-day John
! Long, alias "Slivers," pleaded guilty to
charges of burglary and robbery and
| was sentenced to serve eighteen years
iin State prison. This ends what
j was one of the most puzzling criminal
I cases that ever confronted the officers
j of this county.
Long is the man who in last Febru
-1 ary looted a house at O'Byrne's Ferry,
I this county, and escaped. Alter this
exploit the desperado robbed the same
house in the following June, but ob
tained less plunder than before, when
he got $300 in money. Not satisfied
i with his spoils, "Slivers" walked over
i to a store on the public highway and
i in broad daylight held up the two men
who were in charge and robbed them
! of everything of value about the place.
' He then committed an assault upon
one of the men, beating him about the
' head in such a manner that the victim
i barely escaped with his life.
The robber was masked and made
good his escape. All trace of the man
was lost, but Sheriff Thome stuck to
the trail and continued the search un
til last November, when he obtained a
i clew that soon led to the arrest of the
1 culprit. The fellow was in Stockton
i and was arrested and brought to this
â¢ place. He strenuously maintained ais
â  innocence, but the Sheriff continued to
work on the case and at length ob
i tamed from him a confession.
To-day "Slivers" confessed in open
court that he had committed the crimes
!he was charged with and pleaded
; guilty, receiving the sentence of eight
j een years. '
AIMED AGAINST THE
SWEATSHOP SYSTEM
Quartermaster General Ludington to
Inaugurate Reforms in Cloth
ing Contracts.
NEW YORK, Jan. 28.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Brigadier
General Ludington. quartermaster
general, has determined to prevent
hereafter the manufacture of clothing
for troops under the sweatshop system.
This matter has been under careful in
vestigation by Lieutenant Colonel Wil
liam S. Patton, one of General Lud
ington's assistants, who has been con
sidering a plan for putting an end to
the practice several New York con
tractors are known to have pursued of
rutting out clothing and then giving
th<= pieces to tenement families to sew
together. Lieutenant Colonel Patton
has been assisted by regular inspectors
of the Government, by the New York
State authorities and by the contract
ors themselves, who have frequently
made reports against each other.
It is understood the quartermaster
general will hereafter award the con
tracts to firms, calling only for such
quantities of clothing as they will be
able to furnish with their own facili
ties.

Standard the Duke of Abruzzi Hopes
to Raise Over the
North Pole.
LONDON, Jan. 28.â There is much in
terest here in the Duke of Abruzzi's
north pole expedition. Before his de
parture from Rome Queen Margaret, his
aunt, presented him with an Italian flag
embroidered by her own hands, with
"Sempre avanti Savoia" (Always for
ward Savoy), .a motto identified with
the family. In receiving the gift the
Prince said: "This flag shall wave
over the north pole or I shall not re

The Queen had difficulty in suppress
ing her emotion and pressed his hands,

You will return."
STRIKE RIOTS IN COLON.
Stores Closed to Prevent Them Being
Looted by a Mob.
COLON, Colombia, Jan. 28,â There
was much commotion in Colon to-day
arising from the strike of the dockmen
and railway employes, and large crowd*
of men and women gathered at various
points in the city. The military guards
were reinforced and a number of shots
were fired in the air for the purpose of
intimidating the crowds. During th.;
demonstration several persons were
wounded.
A number of stores have been closed,
the proprietors fearing that their es
tablishments would be looted by the
mobs. Efforts are being made by the
strikers to prevent the workmen in the
machine shops and the switchmen from
continuing work.
CUBAN SOLDIERS
SHOULD BE PAID
Views of Havana's Civil
Governor.
SENOR MORA TALKS PLAINLY
IMPORTANCE OF THIS QUESTION
NOT REALIZED.
Money Needed to Enable Island War
riors to Get a Start in the
Work of Agricul
ture,
SpecUU Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Jan. 28.â Senor Fredrico
Mora, the civil Governor of Havana, in
an interview to-day declared that the
question of the payment of the Cuban
army was of much greater importance
than the Washington Government
seemed to realize. He said if the
Cubans were to collect the customs of
the island, which were their property,
their first action would be to meet
Cuba's sacred obligation to the army
by payment in full of the soldiers. The
customs administration being in the
hands of the Americans, the Cubans
made a simple business proposition to
the United States Government that it
should advance money to pay tha
troops, holding the customs as security.
If the Americans were not present,
Senor _Mora further said, Cuba could
easily obtain the necessary .. .loatt. The
distribution of this money to the army
was essential to permit the country to
proceed with the work at agriculture,
which must form the foundation of its
reconstruction. The army - contained
many men who considered that Cuba
was in a position to demand the full
payment of the army by the United
States, and asserted that other action
on the part of the American Govern
ment would be worse tyranny than was
exercised under a Spanish sovereignty.
Senor Mora considers the underesti
mation of the importance of this mat
ter unfortunate, and his views are held
,by a majority of the Cubans. The heat
of the discussion is daily increasing and
the newspapers of the island are full of
arguments in favor of the payment of
the army.
General Snyder reports that 500 or
600 members of the Cuban army are
camped near Sancti Spiritus, loafing
about and pilfering and begging food.
General Snyder sent word to them that
if they would come to Sancti Spiritus
to help the Americans clean the town
they would receive pay and rations,
but the ofTer was refused, the Cubans
replying that they were soldiers, not
scavengers.
A prominent Spaniard, long a. resi
dent of Cuba, all of whose interests are
here, declares that if the Americans to
morrow demanded the disarmament of
the Cuban army without pay a storm
of passionate protests would follow,
but the army would obey, possibly a
few becoming bandits and taking to the
hills. He says the most salutary steps
taken by the Americans since their ar
rival on the island have been those en
forcing obedience to and respect for
their authority. A policy of too great
consideration in the Americans' rela
tions with the Cubans produced the
impression that the Americans feared
them.
The recent strikes in the country on
plantations and railways are said to
be due to the fact that the Havana
police and other Cuban servants of the
Government are paid tuo much. This
breeds discontent among the laborers,
who consequently demand more than
the farmers can afford to pay.
WALTERS ARRAIGNED
IN SUPERIOR COURT
Slayer of Alfred Cook at Napa Given
Until Monday to
Plead.
NAPA, Jan. 2S.â Jesse Walters was
arraigned before Judge Ham In the Su
perior Court this morning on the charge
of having murdered Alfred Cook, and
was given until Monday to plead.
Before the time for pleading was set
Attorney Beerstecher, on behalf of the
defendant, made a motion to have the
prisoner discharged on the ground that
there was no reasonable ground to be
lieve him guilty of the offense charged
or of any public offense, and that the
defendant had not been legally com
mitted by a magistrate.
District Attorney Bell read a recent
decision of the Supreme Court that
whore a magistrate had held a prelimi
nary examination and had committed
the defendant the Superior Court could
not review the evidence on a motion to
dismiss the charge. This could only
be done by habeas corpus proceedings.
It was on this showing that the court
denied the motion.
TOPEKA'S BOILERS DISABLED.
The Cruiser Examined by Surveyors
and Condemned.
SAN JUAN DE PORTO RICO, Jan.
28. â The United States cruiser Topeka
left here to-day in tow of the supply
ship Sterling. Several days ago orders
were received for the Topeka to con
tinue her cruise, but her engineer re
ported that her boilers were disabled
and that It would be unsafe to pro
ceed. The local board of surveyors
made an examination and condemned
the vessel.
It is the opinion of prominent naval
officers that the disabling of the To
peka will lead to an investigation by
the Secretary of the Navy.

For the First Time Since Her Incar
carceration She Permits the
Attendance of a Phy
sician.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 28.â For four
days Mrs. Augusta Young, the pretty
wife of the alleged incendiary of Ti
buron, who "Jumped" his bail and fled
the country to avoid trial has stood up
bravely and thrown down the gauntlet
to all her enemies. Though ill. she
has utterly refused to see a physician
or take any medicine.
To-day the collapse came. The ex
cited condition of the fair prisoner's
mind and her overwrought nerves,
taken in conjunction with her refusal
to eat a proper amount of food, proved
too great a strain for her frail consti
tution. Sheriff Taylor entered the cell
to find Mrs. Young in a high fever.
Dropping her mantle of reserve, she
demanded that a physician be immedi
ately summoned. Dr. W. F. Jones was
sent for and pronounced the patient to
be in a serious condition. He pre
scribed for her and returned later in
the evening to see how she was pro
gressing. Nobody but the officials and
the physician are now permitted to en
ter the cell.
Mrs. Young has admitted to Sheriff
Taylor and District Attorney Mclsaac
that when she came to San Rafael last
Monday she was unaware that her hus
band had deserted her. This entirely
destroys the "martyr" theory of yellow
journalism. She has also unwittingly
corroborated a strong point in the evi
dence of an important witness. If her
physical condition does not improve
soon it may never be necessary to try
her.

ARE BOUND TO WIN
There is not much interest In such a struggle as this. The man of
brawny frame, of big muscles and generally large development can do every- >
thing better than his puny neighbor. In the everyday affairs of life he is
superior to those who -are weaklings. Do you know which end of that rope
you would be on if you were properly placed? You would be with the poor ;
mortals whose legs ; but barely support them. The state that you find '
yourself In' is due to causes that you might have prevented had you been
wise. .There is no reason why you should not be full of strength. There is
no reason why- others should be strong and you afraid to acknowledge even
to yourself how weak you are. You have a weak back; you have no con- '
fidence in yourself; you feel tired when you should be bright and full of
energy; and you are wasting your vitality daily. You know all this. Why
do you not seek to alter matters? Your strength is being sapped, and you
are less able to fulfill the duties of a perfect man to-day than you were
even a year ago. It is time .to act.

The fact that you tpiay have tried to get well and have received no -
benefit means nothing. You have not tried in the proper way, that is all.
Nature is punishing you because you have abused some one or more of the
powers with which you were endowed. But nature is generous. She will
respond when properly treated. Would you again. have that grand sense of
perfect health? Would you feel , that you are no longer more like a boy
than a man? - If you would, ask about "Hudyan." the grand remedio-treat-
ment which has made the Hudsonian physicians ..famous the wide world
over. Purely vegetable and perfectly harmless, it acts with, marvelous
force. It recreates vitality; it reproduces strength; it sends the warm life's
'* blood bounding through your veins to every portion of your system, making

your face and air your actions are that of one of the finest specimens of the
human race. But "Hudyan" and "Hudyan" alone can do this' grand work..
It is Indorsed by; 20,000 permanently cured men. They sing. its praise in no
uncertain tone. "Hudyan" replaces in man all the vital force, that he has
lost. It works rapidly as well as certainly, and it will not fail. Failure is

MAIL ROUTE AND
MILITARY POSTS
Copper Rrver Country to
Be Improved.
PLANS OF THE GOVERNMENT
THREE EXPEDITIONS WILL BE
SENT NORTHWARD.
Within Two Years Trains May Be
Running From Vaidez Straight
Through to Eagle
City.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SEATTLE, Jan. 28.â Private word
reached Seattle to-day that the Gov
ernment Is contemplating vast improve
ments in the Coppe* .River country and
I will this year send three detachment*
of militia there to lay out a mail route
to the Yukon and establish posts.
The three bodies of military men will
go northward from Seattle in the early
spring, the first detachment leaving
here probably in March. They will be
thoroughly equipped with surveying in-
struments and other tools and in a po
sition to have the trail complete by the
end of the season and ready for use
next winter.
The route will be from Vaidez around
the Vaidez Glacier and straight north
east past lake Abercrombie to Copper
Center; thence over the Millard trail to
the mouth of the Slina River; on north
west to Forty Mile Creek, following
that stream to its junction with the
Yukon and ending near Eagle City,
sixty miles below Dawson.
Three military posts will be estab
lished at important points on the trail,
one of which will be where the road
crosses the Tanana River, another near
Eagle City and the third somewhere
between Valdez and the headwaters of
Copper River.
These stations will be occupied the
year round and supplied with provis
ions and accommodations for mail-car
riers and others who use the trail. It
is intended to send the mail to the
Yukon over that route in the future.
There already has been a railway
right of way granted and it is believed
that within two years one may board a
train at Valdez and ride straight
through the 400 miles to Eagle City.
This will revolutionize travel to inner
Alaska, and, it is believed, result in the
opening of the rich agricultural and
stock-raising districts that are around
the headwaters of the Copper and Ta
nana. ,

of the Court of Cassation Ap-
pear to Have Been Well
Founded.
Eper'al Plepateh to The Ca.ll.
PARIS. Jan. 28.â A semi-official note
Issued this afternoon says that an ex
traordinary meeting of the Cabinet has
decided that the of Justice. M.
Labret, shall submit to the Chamber of
Deputies on Monday next c bill pro
viding that cases of trial revisions are
to be brought before the united sections
of the Court of Cassation whenever the
criminal section shall have pronounced
upon the advisability of an application
for the reviatoa of a previous juugment,
and *hall proceed with a preliminary
inquiry conducted by a delegation con
sisting of more than le-third of all
the members of the court.
In the pr amble of the bill, the Gov
ernment reciting the conclusions of ML
Mazeau, the first president of the Court
of Cassation, on the charges brought
by M. Quesnay de Baurepaire. the presi
dent Of the civil section of that court at
the time of his resignation, will say:
"From the facts adduced by If. Mazeau
It would look wise to entrust the iudg
ment of the Dreyfus affair to the crim
inal section alone."
A lively discussion of the bill is ex
pected to take place in the Chamber of
Deputies, though the measure probably
will be finally \
The facts adduced in M. Mazeau's
report are not, it is said, sufficient
to lead to disciplinary measures
against the criminal court magistrates,
though they are possibly sufficient to
create doubts as to their impartiality
in the public mind.
The decision of the Government is
most unfavorable to the revisionists,
and is a serious reflection upon the
criminal court, though its ultimate ef
fect, if the united courts of Cassation
should favor a revision of the Dreyfus
trial, would undoubtedly leave the anti
revisionists no ground for further asi
tation.
In the meantime the Government's
decision Justifies the charges of M.
Quesnay de Beaurepaire.
In the lobbies o| the Chamber of
Deputies it ta believed that the Gov
ernments bill will not lead to the
resignation of any member of the crim
inal division of the Court of Cassation.
Even if that should result, it would not
change the situation, and the Dreyfus
revision inquiry would proceed. When
it [8 terminated the result will be sub
mitted to the combined Court of Qas
n, in the event of the bill being:
â¢ d.
It is understood that on Monday the
Government will propose that the bill
be submitted to a special committee of
thi Chamber, to which M. Mazeau's re
fill be communicated. The actual
wr-rds or" the conclusion of M. Mazeau's
: t are as follows:
"Without suspecting the honor of the
criminal sect:-: U â  v-urt of Cassa
tion, which remains intact, it appears
wise not to leave it to bear alone the
â¢-.sibility for the definite judgment
which has to be pronounced."

FRENCH IMPERIALISTS
CRY FOR THE RETURN OF
THE BONAPARTE DYNASTY
Enthusiastic Responses by an Audierjce in a Thea

Special Cable to The Call .and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 189?. by James Gcr
den Bennett. â¢ â¢ â  ?.<;:/??; â¢ / r 'â ^â  ;
PARIS. Jan. 28.â Never has the Im
perialist party shown its hand so
boldly as last night, when an as
tounding manifestation was made
by about fifteen hundred support
ers of the Bonaparte dynasty at Nou
veau Theater. At this place a drama
in five acts is being played. It is
called "Le Rni de Rome." If is based on
incidents of the first empire and ap
pears to have found favor. The play
opens with a ball scene at the British
Embassy at Vienna. Here are grouped
the Emperor of Austria, Metternich, all
â rr^at personages of the empire and
Marmont The son of Emperor Na
poleon is shown melancholy and uncer
tain. But his soul awakes in the t>vo
next scenes. In the third he is enam
ored of the Countess Olga de Meik.
In the second an attempted abduc
tion by Jacques Chambert, a Bonapart
ist conspirator, is depicted. It is on thÂ»
point of succeeding, when the Prince
shows hihiself a true son of the con
queror at Austerlitz. After this he goes
on to commit imprudence after imprud
ence; his health fails and in the last
scene his death in the presence of his
mother, murmuring of French victo
ries in his delirium, brings down the
curtain.
At last night's performance word had
been passed for the Imperialist party
to attend in force.
In the first act one of the characters
says. "France longs for the empire."
At this a wild cry of "Oui! Oui!" went
up.
Then afterward, "France is greatly
changed; she has become the prey of
a sang of intriguers. Napoleon's son
has no business in this den of thieves.
Napoleonic tradition is quite dead."

Salisbury Figuring on Combinations
in the Far East Con
troversy.
LONDON. Jan. 25.â Little has been
heard recently of international rivalries
in China, but this does not indicate the
situation has substantially improved.
There is good reason to believe that Lord
Salisbury regards acute trouble in the
spring as certain, unless diplomacy should
meantime find some means of averting it.
He, therefore, is playing a double pame
just now, his main object being to arrive
at a friendly understanding with Russia
and he seems fairly sanguine.
He is also endeavoring to insure a pow
erful coalition against Russia in case she
develops her aggressive policy to an un
bearable extent between now and May.
Here he has not received anything but
generalities in response to his cautions
inquiries as to the extent to which
America would go for the protection of
American interests in the Far East.
Italy, it is understood, has intimated she
will not act without her partners in the
triple alliance. Austria does not regard
her interests as sufficiently great to war
rant her doing anything against Russia,
and the German Emperor this week as
f;ood as declared he would await events.
France is regarded as so surely Russian
that tbfl French Government has not been
approached.

OMAHA, Jan. -â¢s.â The Fremont Hot

condition attached is that the training

Four Years' Search for the Defendant

PORTLAND. Or.. Jan. 2S.â A special to
the Oregonian from Spokane says: After
being followed all over the world for four
years. Mrs. Hattie E. Lowe has been lo
cated in this city, where she has lived for
some months under the name of Helen
Simpson.
She is ordered by. the Superior Court of
Yolo County, California, to appear and
show cause on Monday. March 15, why a
former order in the divorce case of O. A.
Lowe vs. Hattie E. Lowe should not be
modified and the custody of the 8-year-old
girl be given absolutely to the father.
In September. 1593, O. A. Lowe began an
action for a divorce from Hattie E. Lowe
in the Superior Court of Yolo County,
Cal. A cross-complaint was filed by the
woman, and some months later the de
cree of divorce was granted. At the time i
of the granting of the decree an order was
made by the court directing that the little
pirl should remain in the custody of the
father.
Mrs. Lowe succeeded In getting posses
sion of the child and has since been trav
eling. Mrs. Lowe admitted the principal
allegations in the citation sent her from
California and she said she would answer
when the time came.
May Defeat the Naval Bill.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2S.â The introduc

Naval Affairs, permitting the direct ap-
poinunent in the navy of civilian*, has
united all branches of the service in op
position and it is asserted at the Navy
Department to-day that if the amendment
Is persisted in the whole bill will be lost.
The main argument is that the appoint

create just tfuch a "hump" as resulted
from the appointments made during the
civil war. whfch cau^d the stagnation

The general enthusiasm increased as
the piece went on. When Mme. Sans
Gene was spoken of as having become
a marshal's wife from a washer
woman some one asks: "Where is the
only country where such a thing is
possible?"
"France," is the reply. The audience
w^nt wild, crying "Vive IFrance!"
At the close the artists were called
before the curtain as often as though
the performance had been a first night
at an Italian opera house. The death
of the King of Rome brought the au
dience to its feet â with shouts of "Vive
l'Empereur! Vive Prince Victor!"
To-day the enthusiasts are saying
it is the beginning, and, skeptics add,
or else the end. Which will prove to be
in the right?

Automatic Couplers for British Rail
ways.
It is now an open secret that, as the
! result of the recent visit of â¢F. J. S.
: Hopwood, assistant secretary of the Boad
. of Trade, to the United States, the board
'. is seriously contemplating the promotion
of an act of Parliament similar to the law
lately passed in America, to make the use
of automatic couplers compulsory on the
railways of the United Kingdom. The
possibility, of such legislation is a very
serious matter for our railway companies.
Involving as it may, in the estimate of
one general manager., an expenditure of
. no less than Â£7.000,000 of money in refit
l ting the existing rolling stock, besides ;
i having a most important* bearing upon
the safety both of employes and passen
gers, and Transport has within the last ,
, few 1 days interviewed half a dozen of the J
most responsible of our railway menâ <
of them general managers and the other j
: two directorsâ with the object of ascer
taining their views on the situation. One '.
! of those interviewedâ ex-manager, now
â  directorâ expressed himself in favor,
notwithstanding the cost to the com
panies, of legislative action by the Board
! of Trade on the lines above Indicated.
I but the other five pronounced against
j such legislation in . more or less strong
i terms. As the result of its Inquiries,
I Transport has no doubt that a bill to
i empower the Board of Trade to enforce
j the adoption of automatic couplings on â¢
; our lines within a stated period would
: meet ; with strenuous opposition from the
; railway companies; but.' on the other
, hand, the railway authorities display
every disposition to support the board in
; pursuing its investigations into the sub
s ject, and, If a proposal is made by the >
board to hold a public inquiry into the
relative merits of the. coupling systems of
'-. England and America; it will. Transport
. thinks, meet with hearty support on all
i hands.â London Transport.

Old Sumptuary Laws.
The sumptuary, laws that were passed
in the middle ages are quite foreign to
the spirit and temper of the nineteenth
century.-. They j aimed, at keeping each
within his proper sphere by fixing limits
to : the expenditure of citiwns upon ap
parel and other personal concerns. A
1 complete schedule of â  the clothing that
should be worn in every class of society
. was prescribed in the act of the third
year of Edward IV (1464). Apparently an
excess in attire sprang up that had not
: been provided for in this act, for another
, one followed in the ensuing year, pro
; hibiting the wearinsr of shoes with long,
peaked -toes.. The pictures of the people
of the Elizabethan age depict what many
would consider an artistic taste in ap
parel, but which was looked upon at ttib
time as an excess, and called for a proc
lamation (1580) agatpst broad > ruff s, â¢ long

RUSHING FOR
OUR SECURITIES
Change Among British
Investors.
AFTER AMERICAN HOLDINGS
BUYING TAKES THE PLACE OF
THE SELLING ORDERS.
An Interesting Story of How Cecil
Rhodes Aided Kitchener's Vic
torious Campaign in the
Soudan.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, Jan. 28.â The attitude of
British investors toward American
business underwent a notable change
during the past week. The mind of the
British public is always slow to grasp
changes, and people here are only just
beginning to realize what financiers
and politicians have for months con
sidered the most important fact of the
year â the tremendous commercial ad
vancement of the United States. Ever
since the Venezuelan affair the only
idea of British holders of American se
curities has been to sell whenever they
could do so with any profit or without
too great a loss. In the beginning of
the present upward rush of American
stocks both speculators and conserva- â¢
tive holders of transatlantic securities j
were eager to take advantage of the !
opportunity to unload, the former sell
ing for profit in view of the crash in
the market which was deemed inevit- j
able; the latter to get rid of what they j
regarded as unsafe property which they
had been long holding.
Both British and American financiers
who have talked with a representative
of the Associated Press on the subject
agree that the pendulum has now be
gun to swing in the other direction.
Investors, seeing that the anticipated
disasters do not materialize and that
the United States is apparently in for
a period of great prosperity, are com
ing to the conclusion that they weTe
over-hasty in unloading their American
holdings. They are retracing their
steps and are giving orders to their
brokers to rebuy the stocks they dis
carded with a feeling of joy at getting
rid of deadwood, though the news
papers are still croaking dismally over
the panic which Wall street is destined
to witness in the near future, accord
ing to all their prophecies.
Business men who have been inter
viewed agree that, so far as all the
lines of legitimate industry are con
cerned, the United States has every i
reason to be optimistic. Alfred Charles
de Rothschild of X. M. Rothschild &
Sons spoke enthusiastically of the
American outlook. He said: "There
seems to be a period of unparalleled
prosperity before America. So far as
American investments are concerned
the public must, as in any other field,
diPi riminate between what is good and
what is bad. But your crops, manu
factures and commerce all seem to com
bine to place the country on an un-
I usually sound basis, which cannot fail
to awaken admiration throughout the
! world."
One of the most prominent bankers
i remarked: "The United States is rather
l too enterprising for the peace of mind
of Europe. It is rather hard to bt -
lieve that the statistics of American
exports can be true.' His comment
1 seems to represent the views of others.
The Statist is not sure the figures of
Ameriean-'business represent increased^
prosperity. From the decrease in im
ports it argues that the high tariff ;s
compelling the poorer classes to deny
themselves many comforts and that the
farmers, during the years of depression,
contracted debts which they are deter
mined to pay before they allow them
selves their customary comforts.
The Spectator sermonizes on the ef
fect of the speculative boom on the na
tional character and says: "Ten per
cent of the whole population are hav
ing a good big gamble and. being Amer
icans, who don't care much when they
are ruined, they are enjoying them
selves mightily."
This paper believes that the princi
pal effect of such booms is to increase
national sanguineness, adding: "No
typical American ever fears any result
of his own actions: but there are few
typical Americans without some look of
care."'
England has been enjoying a little
boom of her own in South African min
ing enterprises, to which an impetus
has been given by the presence here
of Cecil Rhodes, the South African
magnate, but which attracted small at
tention in the newspapers in compari
son with the more sensational business
across the Atlantic.
Mr. Rhodes' agent. Dr. Rutherford
Harris, says: the Cabinet has promised
an imperial guarantee for the railway
from Buluwayo to the Zambesi River,
a distance of 350 miles, and that when
that section is completed the Govern
ment will guarantee the road to Lake
Tanganyika.
There is an interesting story of Mr. {
Rhodes' services in connection with the !
Soudan campaign which incidentally i
played an important part in influencing !
the Cabinet in his favor. The Govern- !
mem, it appears, could not buy the en- '
gir.es and plant necessary to operate I
General Kitchener's strategic railroad. '
which was an unusual gauge, and when
Mr. Rhodes heard of this he sacrificed
the ecuiipment bought for the British :
Chartaled South Africa Company, and !
so enabled the campaign to be finished |

nearly a year sooner than would have
been possible if he had not come to the
rescue.
A correspondent had an interview
with the Rev. Dr. Werner of the Amer
ican Presbyterian Congo Mission, who
has just arrived in England on his way
to America after four years' residence
at Luebo, in the Kasai district. He
said: "The present mutiny ia prac-
tic-ally the last desperate attempt to
throw off the white man's control. It is
also the most serious outbreak on ac
count of the inaccessibility of the re
gion. When it is remembered that
Baron Dhanis (the Belgian com-
mander) is 300 miles from his base of
supplies with only a handful of whites,
it is no small wonder that so many
Europeans have already been sacri
ficed, and it will ocea^on no surprise if
further disasters awftit the Belgians.
Nothing but building a railway is lik-?ly
to effectually suppress the rebellion.
According to my latest information
Baron Dhanis is practically surrounded

that pa.rric reigns throughout the Congo

true."
Mr. Werner admitted that there had
been some isolated cases of bad conduct
on the part of the subordinate white of
ficers. But, he explained, the adminis
tration as a whole is well intentioned
and improving.

America Not Looked For.
Nobody wanted to discover America.
They wanted to reach India by sea. to
reach Cathay or China and Cipango; a
fabulous island of fabulous wealth, who?a
image seems to have been formed, parti v
from Plato's legend of the island Atlantis,
partly, perhaps-, from rumors of Japan
brought over land, from mouth to mouth,
by Oriental traders, who had never been
further than ("h;ra. and. since tr
venture of Marco Polo, never so far. Mr.
Fiske's admirable book. "The Discover
of America." and the old maps which he
reproduces in it. show that Columbus and
Amerigo Vespucci both died without a
suspicion that they had discovered Amer
ica. They and others after them for jreftra
practically omitted the extent of the Pa
cific from their conception of the glob*-,

However. No Decisive Steps or Nego

Full Reports Arrive From
the Islands.
ghted, 18iÂ«P, by the Associated Press.
RL.IN, Jan. 28.â Public opinion was
focused nil tru* ijamoan question this
week. The United States Embassa
dur, Andrew White, has informed the
correspondent hore of the Associated
that he has had several meet
ings with the Minister of Foreign Af-
Baron yon Bulow, and that as
surances were given on both sides of a
nature calculated to promote a speedy
and successful solution of the question.
Haron yon Bulow'a whole attitude
tended to show that the German Gov
ernment means to d.> its full share in
settling the matter fairly and amica
bly.
Embassador White has been inter
viewed regarding the statements that
the United States wants Germany to
I the German Consul at Samoa,
lit rr F. Ko.sl'. The Embassador said:
"The statements are incorrect. The
truth is that both sides are awaiting
fuller information. Each side decided
ly inclines to believe that mistakes
have been made all around. But just
how far each is responsible there is no
means of telling until the dispatches
arrive her^ and at Washington. The
two governments have discussed the
matter in the most friendly manner and
each haa avowed its readiness to do
whatever is just and righ,t, including
the disavowal of any action of one or
of its agents which may be shown
t" have been contrary to the treaty or
imity of ill-, nations concerned."
From another authentic source the
following learned: The pre
liminary negotiations thus far have not
mutual assurances of a
: friendly and equitable arÂ«
I and the negotiations will
tangible shape until
led . .ail reports are received
Ibe three powers at
This will Involve a delay of
a month In the case of Germany,
though the reports will reach the
United States and Great Britain ear-
Until then no decisive steps or
ati"!;s can be undertaken. The
â¢ s of the German Gov
haa been meager.
- . â¢ 1 partition of the Sa
gTOup among the three powers
which has been discussed in the Ger
man press has not been* broached, the
dent is reliably assured, in
any form by either power.
â jj-.v German press commented on the
an matter variously. The general
xpressed was that the tripar
tite a| t is a failure and ought to
be changed, but opinions differed
cting the remedy. The Kreuz Zei
tung recommends the partition of the
islands, while the semi-official Ham
burg- :;z claims that th^ir
tion is impossible, because of the
;hat the three powers would un
doubtedly want the one valuable island
â Upolu.

Emperor "William's action at Hanover
Is regarded as being of great political
significance. From a member of his
Majt-sty's entourage who accompanied
him to Hamburg, the following has
been learned: The Emperor had ac
cepted an invitation to attend, this
. the silver anniversary wedding
of the Duke and Duchess of Saxe-Co
burg and Gotha, but heard with cha
grin that the Duke of Cumberland, the
Guelph claimant of Hanover and
Brunswick, had also been invited.
Thereupon he sent a strong expression
h dissatisfaction. The Duke of
Cumberland in the meanwhile had ex
pressed regret at his inability to at
tend, the Emperor remaining in high
dudgeon and staying away. There have
persistent rumors lately to the
: that the eldest son of the Duke
of Cumberland might one day ascend
the ducal throne of Brunswick if he
consents to adjure all claim to the
throne of Hanover, demonstrates his
loyalty to Prussia and accepts the
status quo by becoming an officer in a
Prussian regiment of the Guards. The
'â Emperdr, however, seems to have made
his excursion to Hanover in order to
repudiate any Intention of a reap
hment with the former Guelph dy
nasty, and by the proclamation of his
providing for the identification of
thr- Prussian regiments of Hanover
â with the regiments of the old Hano
verian army he has made it plain that
nsiders the union of Hanover and
Prussia to be an unalterable fact. He
thus gave the deathblow to the hopes
of the <lv' Iph party. The Emperor has
established a permanent bond be
, the old Hanoverian regiment and
the pi-sent Tenth Army Corps, which
Is recruited almost entirely from the
province of Hanover.
His Majesty also presented hfc Han
overian I'hlans with a helmet badge
Inscribed ''Peninsula- Waterloo -Garcia-
Hefnandez," and he presented the Han
overian artillery with a badge with the
words "Peninsula -Waterloo-Gohrde."
Ii is said in court circles that the
Emperor for some time past has been
aware of recenfc utterances of the
'.Duke of Cumberland regarding his. Ma
jesty, which have deeply wounded his
steem.
During a long debate in th<> Diet this
. on the expulsion of Danes from
g, th< Ministers certain
ly advanced a number Of reasons justi
fying th* recent measures. The most
convincing came from Dele
gate Behlmann. who described the anti-
German agitation carried on by the
Panes, and furnished a large number
of instances showing thai their object
was clearly to secure a separation of
Northern Schleswig from Prussia.
Those of the speakers who rebuked the
ii of the German press which
1 with the Danes elicited loudest
applause. *
The decoration of Baron yon Koeller,
the Governor of Schleswlg-Holstein,
with the Grand Cross of the Red Eagle
strikingly testifies th.- Emperor's appro
bation of his anti-Danish policy in
North Schleswig.
A high imperial official tells the cor
respondent of thÂ» Associated Press that
the chances of the meat inspection bill
in the Reichstag are good. The Reich
stag will pass it In spite of the Agra
rian opposition. Some members of the
Reichspartel support It. so the Govern
ment feels sure of a strong majority.

TIBURON. Jan. 28.â Luke T^m:iy -md
Antono Sllvn, fisherman of the Marln
Islands, nearly lost their Hves by the cap
sizing of a small boat in the bay yester
day. After clinging; for an hour to the
overturned boat, which they managed to
reach after a hard struggle, the two were
rescued by Charles McNeill in the launch
Norwood." Lemay and Sllvn started to
father driftwood in a flat-bottomed skiff
with a crude kind of centrrboanl. This
centerboard became loosened in Raccoon
Straits, and in trying to adjust it the skill
was capsized. Silva was unable to swim.
1., may caught hold of him and started to
swim for the skiff, which had floated
twenty or thirty feet away. Silva lost his
head, and very nearly succeeded in stran
gling his rescUCf, but both finally reached
the boat in an exhausted condition. They
I clung to it for over an hour, anil became
so thoroughly chilled that their numb
lingers were scarcely able to retain their
hold 'Their cries for help were unheard.
and as dusk was coming on, both feared
they would drift unnoticed out through
the Golden Gate.
Captain < 'Maries McNeill caught sight
of a strange object in the bay from his
boathouse, and went out in thÂ«> launch
Norwood to see what it was. Roth men
were dragged on board, more dead than
alive, and brought to Tiburon. wh-rc they
were given a cnange of garments and
stimulants. They were able to return to
j their homes to-Bay.

TO HANDLE THE
PRUNE OUTPUT
New Fruit Association
Organized.
MILLION DOLLARS CAPITAL
EMBRACES THE ENTIRE PA
CIFIC COAST.
The Corporation to Pack and Market
the Crop and Maintain the
Highest possible
Prices.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Â«ax- toctt Tur. 9R ThÂ» Ponlfl
SAN JOSE, Jan. 28.âThe Pacific
Coast Fruit Association, having for its
object the handling of the entire prune
crop of California, Oregon and Wash-
inpton. was formally organized here to-
day with a capital of $1,000,000. The |
stock is divided into 100,000 shares of j
the par value of 510 each. Articles of
incorporation will be filed, and the fol
lowing board of directors has been
named for that purpose: D. M. Delmas.
president; D. F. Graham, secretary; W.
P. Cragin. Philo Hersey, S. R. Johnson,
C. W. Childs. Jai.es Farwell. E. A.
Hayes, F. W. Crandall. This board is
only temporary, and as soon as incor- I
poratlon is effected a meeting will be
called and directors chosen who will
represent all sections of the Pacific
Coast.
In combining the prune-growers of
California, Oregon and Washington in
the Pacific Coast Fruit Association the
fruit industry will be materially ad
vanced, the market [strengthened and
growers obtain better prices for their
product. It is to become active and od
erative with 75 per cent of the prune
men of the three States enrolled, and
from the interest already manifested
this will be but a few weeks hence.
The organization does not propose to
"bear" the market, but will transact
its business with and through the exist
ing channels of trade. The by-laws
and constitution and the contract
which the growers enter into with the
association are similar to those of the
Raisin Growers' Association.
The agreement between the growers
and the association will be in substance
'aa fÂ°"< )Ws: The grower agrees to trans
; fcr to the association 5 per cent of the
crop of prunes now growing or to be
; grown during the years 1899 and 1900.
In consideration of this transfer the as-
I sociation agrees to undertake the pack
ing and sale of the entire crop and to
establish and maintain uniform grades
of prunes and packing to be done in
conformity therewith; also to make
trades under its own trademark and
guarantee the quality and to make said
sales as speedily as possible and at the
highest obtainable prices. The associa
tion agrees to store the crop and to
keep it insured pending sale, and to ad
vance money to pay the expense of
packing and storing. The grower must
care for and cultivate at his own ex
pense said crop and cure it lo the satis
faction of the inspector of the associa
tion and deliver it at some packing
house selected by the association. After
the crop shall have been delivered the
association agrees to advance to grow
ers 1 cent per pound on their crop, such
advance to bear interest at a rate not
exceeding 8 per cent; the prunes of all
growers shall be mixed and sold in that
manner and shall be accounted for at
an average price for the entire year
and payments made as soon as the pro
ceeds are received. It is provided that
should the grower fail to carry out his
part of the contract the association
may without legal process take control
of the crop and market it.

MISSING BOND FOUND.
Developments in the Aptos Bridge
Contract Fraud.
SANTA CRUZ, Jan. 25.-The Supervis
ors to-day resumed the investigation of
the substitution of certain plans for the
original in the contract for the Aptos
bridge. Employes of the San Francisco
contractor who was aworded the contract
admitted the plans under consideration
were not those which were originally
adopted, but claimed they did not know
who substituted them. They produced a
copy of the original plans and announced
their willingness to follow them. The Su
pervisors decided to postpone action un
til the regular meeting and examine close
ly the plans. The missing bond given by
the contractor has been found.

Project Advocated by the Citizens of
Mill Valley.
MILLS VALLEY. Jan. 28.â The resi
dents of this place have thoroughly tired
of the notoriety gained by tho suits con
stantly being brought by the Tamalpals
Land and Ferry Company to restrain cer
tain persons from violating the articles
of their agreement made in purchasing
land by selling liquor, and will try to stop
the litigation which is fast injuring the
name of Mill Valley as a summer resort.
Public sympathy is with th^ company, for
the sale of liquor has caused many dis
turbances of the peace and what are al
leged to have been two attempts at rob
bery.
The latest project advocated to stop the
practice which has made a "Jagtnwn '
possible is to Incorporate thy town. afte,r
which a town ordinance forbidding the
pale of liquor can be adopted. According
ly, the plan has been agitated until its
pYomoters are satisfied the citizens will
vote for incorporation. A mass meeting
to consider The question will be held next

MAY SUE WARDEN
HALE FOR DAMAGES
San Quentin Saloon-Keeper Claims
He Is Being Boycotted by Order
of the Official.
SAN QVENTIN. Jan. 2S.â The order of
Warden Hale forbidding guards to visit
saloons has resulted In a new complica
tion. J. R. Robinson threatens to sue the
Warden for causing his business to be
boycotted. Some time ago Hale and Rob
inson had a disagreement because the lat
ter refused to vote to suit the head of
the prison when acting as delegate to the
Republican county convention. Since
then they have been, at dagger points.
Robinson asserts that the order forbid
ding the guards to visit a saloon was
made to apply only to his resort and that
the men wore even forbidden to enter
there to purchase groceries. He asserts
that his business will be ruined as a re
sult of what he terms a boycott on the
part of Warden Hale, "practiced to help
him retain his position," and went to San
Kafael to-day to see an attorney with
the Intention of bringing suit against
Hale for boycott

THE ONTI-CARTOON BILL.
THERE is journalism and journalism. Let it be
a'trnitted that the control of publicity by a news
paper can be abused, and is often abused. But
when persistently abused it carries its own remedy in
olute loss of reliability and sacrifice of public
confidence.
Jetterson was much subjected to mere personal
by the press of hi? day. but when solicited in
favor of measures to limit the freedom of the press,
- that it might be shorn of the power to abuse
that freedom, he responded that as between govern
ment without freedom of the press, and freedom of
the press without government, he preferred the latter.
The House at Sacramento has passed a bill amxing
a misdemeanor .penalty to the publication of cartoons
in a newspaper. It has been urged to passage by
certain members whose experiences in public life have
included cartoon attacks on them that were without
the element of humor and. as they conceive, were
merely malicious and malignant. These members
seem to be unaware that as iar as these cartoons were
merely malicious they were without influence upon the
public mind. A cartoon that is extravagantly malig
nant, like the '"coffin handbill" circulated against An
drew Jackson, that does not graphically represent a
truth, is really ineffective, and no upright man has
ever been permanently harmed by it. The injury has
aiways been reactive in its nature and has fallen upon
the paper itself.
When Samuel J. Tilden entered upon the prosecu
tion of Tweed and Tammany in the Courthouse
frauds, by which $29,000,000 had been stolen from the
taxpayers, his most powerful coadjutor was Thomas
the father of American cartooning. His pic
â¢: Tweed had in them the element of humor,
together with a savage sense of justice, and did more
tc break the power oi Tweed over public opinion than
anything els?. The Tammany Judges, even, flinched
in protecting their patron in the presence of Nast's
avenging pencil.
The lampoon long preceded the cartoon. It was
used in leaflet iorm. That prince of pamphleteers,
William Cobbett, was also the master of lampoon
ing, but his art was used in the merciless flaying of
those who deserved to be flayed, and it did not em
barrass his advancement to respectable literary repu
tation, even when his talent as a lampooner appeared
in his "History of the English Reformation."
Butler's Hudibras is nothing more than a lam
poon in doggerel, and to Hogarth's illustrations pub
lished in it may lie precisely the same objections
which members of the Legislature make to the news
paper cartoon. That the caricatures of Gilbert, issued
in London in sheets, before the processes for printing
pictures in newspapers were invented, were useful in
their day in exposing the follies and vices of the Eng
lish court and the corruptions of politicians, was a
fact of current acknowledgment, and after a century
has gone by they are now accepted as a valuable part
of the history oi the time in which they were issued.
There is no doubt that his whimsical and malicious
cartoon of Burke drawing a dagger and flinging it
upon the floor of the House of Commons as the
climax of a speech annoyed that statesman, but it did
not affront him half as much as the exclamation of a
fellow member, "Yes, there's the knife, but where's
the fork?" The reputation of Burke, however, sur
vived both.
That the reading public discriminates in its accept
ance of cartoons, and, while discriminating, desires
and does not repudiate their use, is proved by their
popularity, which has required the founding of art
schools of newspaper illustration.
This general fact may be affirmed of the practice,
that no upright and strong man whose injury would
be harmful to society and the State by abridging his
usefulness, was ever hurt by a cartoon, while many
a rascal whose exile from public life is a distinct pub
lic berittfit has been run to cover by them.
The California Legislature cannot afford to pass
a law that would have taken from the pencils of Ho
garth, Leech and Nast their power and usefulness. It
cannot in justice to itself affirm that the people are
without judgment and sense. It cannot, in view of
its own reputation, afford to say that its members are
i-o vulnerable or so weak that they can be destroyed
by a picture.
Therefore, it will rise above the importunities of a
few whose thin skins have been punctured by a pen
cil point, and will ascribe to the people their just
merit of the power to sift evidence, whether in words
or pictures, and reach a just conclusion.
The bill for extension of the seawall southward has
not passed the Senate, but merely to a third reading.
However, the merits of it are so generally recognized
that it is not expected to encounter any serious ob
stacle when put upon its final passage.
THE CALL VINDICATED.
AS we have often said heretofore, it is not a
pleasant task to go sternh and firmly to the
duty that fell to The Calj in the case of
Speaker Wright.
It would be a pleasure to know that in the legisla
tive incidents collateral to the election of a Senator
there was no call to such a duty as we have had put
upon us. Its discharge has been unaffected by any
personal rancor, and we have been vindicated by the
report of the investigating committee, in the appoint
ment of which we had no choice, and by an investiga-
tion that The Call did not direct nor iniluence even
in the calling of a witness, except by a plain statement
of truth and facts made by .Mr. Leake. which of
necessity divulged the lines along which the investi
gation must follow, if projected in the direction of
the resolution which ordered it. In Mr. Leake's tes
timony he very carefully separated the information
which was primary and secondary. The latter, being
hearsay, was given only its legitimate place in the
narrative, and. as is the fate and fortune of secondary
evidence, some of it has been affirmed and some has
been denied by subsequent revelations. This primary
evidence has been vindicated to the letter. Not a jot
of it stands impeached, and the conclusion reached
unanimously by the committee stamps it with the offi
cial seal of perfect credibility.
That testimony presented Wright in the attitude of
a conscript in the Burns camp and a spy and confi
dence operator in the ranks of Bulla, a hired and paid
parasite of Grant, and a suppliant to The Call for help
and confidence which he betrayed. We put the coat
on the back of this man, and the committee report
is that it fit? him and it will stay buttoned to him
always.
What we have done in the matter was (of the honor
of our State and party. The good name of neither
can long survive such conduct as Wright's. The
committee has appreciated this and did not evade its
duty to cut to the line.
But the report tells more than it tells. It paints
Wjight as he is. sneaking into five antagonistic
camps, swearing allegiance to five antagonistic poli
cies, making himself a polygamist of pledges and
plighted faith and binding implications. Having be
trayed The Call, after seeking voluntarily our help in
his ambitions; having betrayed Grant, after taking
his money: having betrayed Bulla, after using his
friends as a footstool to the Speakership, does any
one believe that this five-ply intriguer inscribed his
name on the Burns black list from any innocent mo-
tive? Does any one believe that virtue rose in him
and took his hand and led him into the Burns camp
and washed his sins of betrayal away? Such a belief
would be inconsistent with common sense. Picking
up votes by pledge? to'Bulla. and influence by volun
tary promises to The Call, and money by professing
support of Grant, what did he pick up by crawling
into the Burns tent under the canvas? The situation
illuminates the Burns campaign and exposes it as
mercilessly as if words and phrases had been used to
do it by the committee.
To those who hope tor a Republican future, for the
good name of the State, for the elevation of public life
and honor in high places. The^Call sends greeting
and warning that the fight for.tfiese is not won until
it is won. We are merely the instrument of public
opinion in making that fight. The people must sup
port it. Speaker Wright may be plucked from his
chair by the hand of justice, or he may sit there to
defile the place, as the people choose to have it. We
believe they don't desire to share his disgrace by per
mitting its parade in a high station, and it is for them
to burst through the asbestos of selfishness and design
which encrusts the carcasses of managers, touts and
tools at Sacramento and insist that judgment fall upon
this culprit to the end that fear may fall upon any who
would imitate him.

Siam, it is learned that Lord Charles Beresford,
now on his way home from an extended tour of the
Orient, will probably be in San Francisco at some
time during the month of February, and Mr. Barrett
suggests that arrangements be made to invite him to
address the Chamber of Commerce upon the possibili
ties of commercial extension in that part of the world.
The reason for the suggestion is the growing impor
tance of the Oriental trade, and Lord Beresford's ac
curate knowledge of the situation there. He has
just made a prolonged visit to China for the purpose
of investigating the political, industrial and trade con
ditions of the people, and Mr. Barrett says, "No other
prominent foreigner has had such opportunities for
getting at the truth."
Our interests in the trade of the Orient are so great
that no opportunity of learning the latest phases of
the situation should be neglected. It is unquestion
able that a man of Lord Beresford's known ability,
who has made a comprehensive study on the spot of
the trade affairs of Chinese ports, can give us much
information that will be of value to us.
Mr. Barrett has been one of the most zealous offi
cials who have represented the United States abroad.
While in Siam he was ever vigilant in watching for
commercial chances, and prompt to report them as
soon as discovered. His letter shows that he is, still
as keenly interested as ever in such issues, and de
sires to arouse in San Francisco the energy needed to
profit by them. The eminent position held by Beres
ford in Great Britain entitles him to distinguished
consideration when he arrives in this city, and it
would be doubly gratifying to obtain from him an
address on a subject of so much importance to our
commercial welfare as that which Mr. Barrett sug
gests.
It now appears that it was Miller of San Francisco
and not Merrill who introduced the bill for the im
prisonment of debtors. Being thus absolved from the
responsibility of this act, Mr. Merrill may yet be
brought to a proper realization of his obligation to
Mexican Burns on account of those railroad tickets.
Senator Cutter need not at this late day howl that
there were no Grant men on the investigating com
mittee. The Grant men had every opportunity to be
represented, and declined.
.If there are any Senatorial candidates who can
demonstrate that Wright had not promised to support
them, they will have on hand plenty of raw material
for a boom.
Wright was one of the presiding officers of the
joint session yesterday, but there is nothing in the
report to show that he looked happy.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 29, 1899.
AMERICANISM VERSUS IMPERIALISM
THE rise of Americanism against the Imperialists
was at first slow, but it is now rapidly spread
ing and becoming more and more effective. Its
latest expression in both houses of Congress will at
tract the notice of the civilized world. A number of
arguments have been made by Senators and Represen
tatives that recall the Augustan days of the republic,
and, without detracting from the merits of others, it
may be truthfully said that the speech of Mr. Johnson
of Indiana almost deserves to rank as a classic.
The extraordinary feature of the annexation
scheme, fomented by mercenary greed and by that
vaulting ambition which "o'erleaps itself." is that,
under our constitutional Government, it should have
had any .serious advocates. And, whatever might be
said about other parts of the country, that, in the
State of California, it should have attracted either
popular or legislative support is doubly unaccount
able. The inconsistencies and the glaring disregard
of our most important interests, into which the local
attorneys for the annexationists have been betrayed,
a c alone sufficient to repel the sympathy of our in
telligent citizens, and especially those who are not
avariciously speculating upon the wealth of the Phil
ippines.
The Chronicle and the Examiner, in many respects
antagonistic, are a unit upon Asiatic annexation.
They profess themselves to be strongly opposed to
the retention of the Philippines as colonial dependen
cies with the "open door" policy for the special bene
fit of Great Britain, but favor their incorporation into
the territory of the United States, with citizenship
and all other rights flowing from that relation to the
Government. The Pacific Coast has been and is
unanimously against Asiatic immigration, and, in the
face of long-continued opposition in the East, after
vainly clamoring for years, succeeded in having the
exclusion law passed. In this State a special vote on
the subject was taken, and only a few straggling bal
lots were cast in favor of the Chinese. The intelli
gent discussion of the danger threatened by peaceful
Mongolian invasion, the practical experience of cities
ir other States, to which the aggressive Chinese rap
idly spread, and the excellent results of the exclusion
laws, even when inefficiently and dishonestly admin
istered, converted every other part of the Union to
our policy, and it is true that when war with Spain
was declared there was no sentiment in the country in
favor of the Mongolians except among a few monopo
lists who desired cheap labor. George C. Gorham
once publicly canvassed the State for Governor, but
his friendship for the Chinese swept him into political
oblivion. . C. P. Huntington always wanted cheap
labor for the railroad, but in the San Joaquin and
Sacramento valleys, in more places than one, his
Asiatic employes were not permitted to leave the
track. In iS'to. at a Fourth of July celebration in
Oakland, Senator Stewart of Nevada delivered a
philippic on behalf of the Chinese. But, for some
years, this entire nation has been held together for
the benefit of the white race and of our fellow citizens
of African descent, upon whom the inestimable boon
of freedom was conferred by the Civil War, and thus
our national life brought into harmony with our in
stitutions.
The Chronicle and the Examiner were forced to
express and to maintain the settled public opinion
and the legislation that warned Asia against any at
tempt to evade America. It is not so long ago, in
deed, that the tocsin of alarm was rung against "the
little brown men" of Japan, elated by their victory
over China, and suspected of the preposterous belief
that they could compel us to receive them in unlim
ited numbers. When, however, the war with Spain
began, this Caucasian republic had presented an im
pregnable front to the hordes of Asia and the paupers
and criminals of Europe. America was for Ameri
cans, who combined the best strains of the great races
of the earth.
Now, however, the Chronicle and Examiner â par
nobile fratrum â in their desperate effort to justify the
unconstitutional annexation of Asiatic territory, have
deliberately turned upon the people, whose rights and
whose interests they have pretended to represent. So
far as we are apprised they antagonize the administra
tion, which in the Examiner is not so remarkable,
and they antagonize every member of Congress who
has so far spoken for expansion, by insisting upon the
investment of the Philippines with the full legal right
and privileges that belong to American territory.
They know that absolute freedom of locomotion is an
element of American citizenship of which, even
though the constitution has been "outgrown," it can
not yet be deprived. They know that the Filipinos,
once received as American citizens, can spread them
selves over every part of the republic. The facilities
of intercourse with the Philippines in these modern
times, when steam and electricity have become the
handmaids of man, is one of the chief arguments used
to justify the American people in plunging headlong
into the Asiatic maelstrom, and these papers know
that, when cheap laborers are available, capital will
speedily devise means to bring the demand and the
supply together. It follows that all the arguments
against annexation in Asia that grow out of the legal
framework of our Government, the history and the
character of our people, and the spirit of our civili
zation, in a purely utilitarian sense, are overtopped by
the danger to industry involved in the forcible absorp
tion of the Filipinos, under a claim of divine right,
purchased from Spain, and that on 4he borders of the
Pacific these arguments, specialized by the Chronicle
and the Examiner, repudiate our uniform policy and
our uniform demands and constitute the deepest
treachery to our people, who are ready for the com
mercial and financial supremacy of the twentieth
century, but are welded in the determination to pre
serve our existing standard of race and of blood, and
equally to reject political and individual contact with
Asiatic barbarians and polygamists who could never
assimilate with us, and who could only be ruled by
us as slaves and through a standing army.
We shall observe with interest, in the midst of the
distressing revelations at Sacramento, the "future
course of the Legislature in reference to the Asiatic
question, that has been brought so nearly home, and
the expansion or contraction of the revolutionized
policy of the Chronicle and the Examiner in pitting
the Philippine archipelago against California and, the
Union.
It is to be hoped that Senator Morehouse can pos
sess himself in patience for a little while. He would
create trouble for himself by killing any newspaper
men now. In the interval before the passage of his
bill he might profitably devote himself to target prac
tice.
The fact that the Works anti-cartoon bill got
through the Assembly demonstrates that Assembly
men are not averse to a joke. But for the knowledge
that the measure would be smothered in the Senate
it would not have had a ghost of a show.
The mere fact that the other fellow got more votes
lias been sufficient to knock Dcnnery out. Naturally
he feels aggrieved, and thinks justice is dead.
To the members of the joint Assembly: "Now will
you be good?"
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
To resume work tn this department,
which has made for me so manytfriends
and so many enemies, is a genuine
pleasure. Greeting to both and to the
latter confusion. For several weeks I
have been among the statesmen trying
to learn of them and finding they have
little to teach save that which is con
veyed through their attitude as a lot
of terrible examples. My impression
that the professional politician belongs
to a low order, that his word is worth
less, his ambition mercenary, has been
fully confirmed. When a set of men
get together and have not sense and
principle enough among them to elect
a United States Senator it is time for
the matter to be taken out of their
hands. When they are afraid to vote
on any measure without first having
consulted their owners it is time to
keep them at home and try the effect
of intellect and honesty in public places.
But this condemnation does not by any
means include all the legislators. There
are in both houses members above sus
picion or reproach.
That there is corruption at Sacra
mento is beyond question. Its agents
are on the spot. So gross and palpable
are the workings <*f evil iniluence that
a man can hardly mingle with the leg
islative mob and escape the suspicion
of being dishonest. This truth shines
with particular effulgence in connection
with the contest for Senator. When a
band of lawmakers stands by Burns
and declares that nothing can weaken
its fealty it must be there is something
wrong. I would not deny to Burns the
possession of many good qualities, but
he is not adapted by training to take
a seat in the Senate of the nation. As
to his record, I say nothing. To me it
is a matter of hearsay. But when
Burns on the stand swears he has not
expended a cent to promote his own
candidacy, credulity braces up and de
cjares that it has endured, to the limit.
Even with Gunst, Herrin and Mc-
Laughlin to back the story it still
seems to lack the most essential ele
ment. Yet in a business transaction
the word of any of these men would be
accepted without bond. 'In social- re
lations there would not rise occasion
for questioning their veracity. In poli
tics it is different.
â¢ â¢
As this is written the report of the
investigation committee has not been
received and I have no idea as to the
character ot it. Nevertheless, the fact
is clear that the Burns people captured
the committee, whether with or without
the consent of the prisoners I do not
say. There was never better politics
than they exercised, and there was
never politics more shameful. The
terms are equivalent. Politics as now
operated constitutes an organized sin.
The regrettable feature about the In
vestigation has been that it set rumor
in motion, and rumor spares none.
Honest Assemblymen, honest Senators
and honest journalists have been as
sailed. Perhaps this will not harm
them, but it Is far from a desirable ex
perience. But for all the theory of a
"sack" my three weeks at the capital
led to the belief that the talk is based
largely on hope. Money has doubtless
been expended, but to go into the open
market now with bids for votes or in
fluence would require the courage to
face exposure and disgrace.
* * â¢
It seems to me that of all the people
summoned before the committee to ex
plain, Grant was the gentleman. He
acknowledged having spent money and
considerable of it. He did not think
there was anything reprehensible in
having done so, for his manager had
been instructed to expend it legiti
mately. There are certainly legitimate
expenses connected with a campaign â
fare and compensation for speakers,
printing, carriage and the hire of halls.
Yet as Grant told the truth about that
which he had done he blushed, and the
witnesses who on the stand before him
and after had smoothly lied while every
listener knew them to be lying had
never turned a hair. It was a strange
exhibition. Grant went upon record
condemned, by his own words. The
others had a moral bill of health sworn
to by themselves, but perforce, accept
able. In the minutes of the session
they stood unspotted. How were their
consciences?
* â¢ â¢
I do not propose either to rehash or
to prognosticate. The story has been
told day by day, and as for the future,
one has as much right to peer into it
as another. I simply give the guess
that no Senator will be elected, and
since Burns and Grant are out of it,
Bulla never in it, Scott a vain hope
and Barnes with only his Intellect and
the charm of his oratory and his fine
presence to commend him, there seems
nothing left but a continuation of the
deadlock. Barnes would be a credit to
the State. The Southern Pacific does
not want him. He is scholarly, decent,
dignified, able, and with no golden coin
wherewith to pave his way. Therefore
does he fail to appeal to the senses,
not of the people, but of the material
the people have chosen to represent
them. If Burns secures a caucus this
is all off. The caucus is the refuge of
the coward and the shield of the pur
chased. Burns might come out of a
caucus triumphant.
* â¢ â¢
An amusing feature of legislation is
the attitude of the mighty toward the
newspapers that made them. There is
Senator Ashe, a Democrat whom the
papers helped because of the notorious
unfitness of his rival, now trying to
curtail the freedom of the press. There
is Morehouse, whom the papers have
never wantonly abused, trying to secure
for himself the privilege of slaying such
editors as may fail to pay him the
deference he deems proper. These fel
lows make me* tired. I do not use the
term in the ordinary and perhaps vul
gar sense, but to see the assumption of
superiority on the part of men who are
in no manner superior is a bit trying.
My belief is that the average reporter
does more brain work in a day than the
average Senator, partly because he has
more brain.

To write concerning a Legislature
and its hangers on is a duty I would
have been glad to have escaped. To
tell the truth is to wound, as there are
many things which do not look well in
print. I found at Sacramento that
there was necessity for attacking
friends, for they were on the wrong
side and employing methods upon
which Heaven could not smile. The
politician has a dual existence, but I
am unable to trace the dividing line.
In whacking the politician I more than
once bruised a good fellow, and it was
in the latter capacity that he came to
me later to protest.

There has been so much ba-ad talk
at Sacramento that it is a wonder no
body has been thumped, cut or shot.
The climax of hostility seems to have
been reached when Major MoLaughlin
spat in the face of Goucher. Like many
others the major is there in a double
capacity. As chairman of the State
Central Committee he is working for
the glorification and advancement of
the party. As plain Major McLaughlin
he is whooping it up for Burns. I do
not know in which capacity he does his
spitting.

Senator Simpson has introduced &
measure which will in all likelihood be
killed, as he will advocate it himself.
But it richly deserves' this fate for the
principle of it is bad and vicious. This
bill is a Sunday law. For many re
formers one can have respect, but the
ultra-Sabbatarian is ignorant, narrow
minded and selfish, a crank whom the
impulse to thrust from the lobby, speed
ing his departure with a kick, is natural
and laudable. I have neither space nor
patience to go extensively into the
question he raises. There is only one
argument in favor of a Sunday law
and this is that everybody is entitled
to one day of rest in seven. There is
not a craft nor calling in which the
employe cannot get a day off, and when
he gets that day I believe the attempt
to dictate to him what he shall do with
it is a piece of inexcusable imperti
nence. The ministers think that if on
Sunday they could close every avenue
to pleasure and recreation thre multi
tude could be forced to go to church.
They would have the parks shut up, the
trains to suburban resorts stopped, an
outing deemed a crime. Now people
will not go to church, because there
usually Is neither profit nor joy in go
ing, and they do not propose that the
voice from the pulpit, to which they
do not listen, shall dictate to them as
to the conduct of their daily lives. They
will continue to take the children Sun
day and go out to the beach or the
woods, and the effort to prevent them
will not be tolerated. For my part,
after six days of toil, I am grateful to
get into the blessed sunshine and the
country air, and do not propose to turn
from this scheme to a sanctuary where
in gathers a highly reputable social
club, somewhat exclusive, listening to
doctrines the members do not practice,
and pretending to worship a master
from every tenet of whose sublime
teachings they have departed. For the
sincere Christian, who follows as close
ly as he may the footsteps of this great
teacher I have a warm regard, but it
is not this type which is now demand
ing a Sunday law for California. On
the contrary, it is the canting, snivel
ing, hypocritical, holier-than-thou va
riety, who constitute a burden to the
church itself and a nuisance to all
without the fold. Unless Simpson shall
succeed in talking this iniquitous meas
ure to death I shall take the liberty
hereafter of making a few remarks
about it.

If the Legislature has done anything
tending to the restriction of races I
have overlooked it, and yet the subject
is important. Racing as conducted in
this town and in Oakland is wicked,
representing not sport but gambling. It
thrives through the gullibility of suck
ers. It has lured countless young men
to ruin and dragged women to shame;
broken up families, caused embezzle
ment, suicide and murder. Racing sup
ports an army of touts and vagrants,
and fills the pockets of a few con
scienceless speculators. On its local
basis it is intrinsically a fraud, a me
nace to public morals, a drain on in
dustry. There is no good to set over
against the ruin it accomplishes, but it
fattens the bookies and other grafters
and is permitted to go on unhindered.
This is an outrage and a shame. If
the money the race tracks take in could
appear to the promoters as it is, stained
with blood and dishonor, they might
not spend it sn gaily. If the victims
could see themselves, flies struggling
helpless in a web, they might abandon
the game. Bat neither will see. The
races should either be regulated or pub
lic indignation should close them. As
all the year round temptations they
blight and curse the community.
One Greene has arrived at Vancouver
with a wild .tale of cannibalism to
which eleven of his comrades fell vic
tims, while he, possibly being less suc
culent", escaped. Among other evidences
of his veracity Greene points to the
fact that the horrors he witnessed while
awaiting his turn to go into the pot
changed his hair snow white. With
every possible sympathy for Greene I
take the liberty of thinking that there
is not a wo(d of truth in his tale. The
hair climax spoils the whole business.
The only circumstance under which
hair turns white all at once is when
the dye runs in the wash.
I do not believe the members of the
First California would approve of all
this yowl for their speedy return. They
enlisted for two years, they are not
children, and glad as we would all be
to see them back we do not want it
thought they shirked any possible duty.
They have acquitted themselves well
and may have a chance to add to their
record for bravery. Certainly when put
in the attitude of begging to come home
they are adding nothing to it.
Supervisor Perrauit says he is not a
reformer, which leads me to the belief
that he is a genuine one. The men

That not to live to self has man been

Because to .grant us it were not the best.

me if I would take the child and

I wrote to Mr. Garcia, and he said
he had no objections, and F told the

bills were paid for its keep. He was
very kind and attentive, and I con
sidered everything all right.
"However, before the baby was
taken away it was considered neces
sary to baptize it. and one morning.
When Mr. Shea was in town, the in
fant waÂ§, taken to the Church
Guadalupe. on Broadway, and bap
tized as 'Thomas Albert Shea.' Mr.
Shea said he did not care to go,
and he stayed in bed in ihe apart
ments of the woman who called her
self Mrs. Shea, and who was other
wise known as Ivy West, Maria
Migratti and other names.
"When we returned from the bap
tism Mr. Shea was very happy, and
that evening he gave us all a ban
quet in honor of the christening at
the cafe in the Baldwin Hotel. At
that time he remarked to my brothi r
that it was rather trying to have to
support two families and raise chil
dren. Then I took the child to my
home in Santa Barbara, where I
kÂ«-pt it for a year and a half. A long
time after that I had received but
$1."., and I kept getting promising
letters but no more money. Then
the mother came to visit me and
see how the baby was getting along.
She had no money but plenty of
promises, and before she went away
she had borrowed the money to pay
for her ticket on the steamer. I
have not seen that money yet, or
any further payments on account
of "the debt. I heard that she was
given some money to send to me,
but that she went away to Portland,
Or., and had a good time with it.
"Finally 1 brought the child back
to this " city on the agreement
that I would receive my Day in full.
A woman friend of Mrs. Shea.or Ivy
West, came up to me and asked to
take the child out for an airing.
That was the last I saw of the little
one. I understand it is now being
cared for by this same woman in
this city. However. I could not
very well have held the child for the
debt, under the circumstances. I
do not want to make trouble for
anybody, but we are poor people and
LECTURES ON RUSSIA.
Marsden Manson Talks of the Land
of the Czar.
The popularity of the Mechanics' Insti
tute's series of lectures is on the increase,
judging by the immense throng that filled
its lecture hall last evening to listen to
Mart-den Manson's description of his trip
through Russia. The well-known civil en
; gineer spoke interestingly for ovfÂ»r an
' hour, and his remarks were illustrated
with stereoptlcon views of the scenes he
visited.
The lecture was complete in detail and
was punctuated with humorous anecdotes.
! The large audience was enlightened on the
contents and history of important uni
versity and public buildings: the habits
of the people and their government. At
the conclusion of his entertaining talk he
was warmly applauded.
Dr. Harold VT. Fairbanks will deliver
j the next lecture of the series on Satur-
I day evening. February 4. His subject will
j be "How the Sierra Nevada Mountains
I Were Made."
Kicked by a Horse.
-.Thomas Page, residing at the corner of

The other side of the story is es
sentially different. "Con" Shea, the '
principal defendant, does not deny
a knowledge of the woman Ivy
West, but says that she is using- the
court and other people to blackmail ,
him. It is understood that she has
absorbed substantial sums of his
money heretofore through threats
and promises that sh.> would never
ask for more. He proposes to fight
the matter to a finish, and declares
that while it cannot be shown that
he is the father of the child, he can
prove that she is a woman of bad
reputation and has been an inmate
of three several houses of ill repute
in this city and elsewhere. '

for sensational developments when

COURSING ON
CARPET GREEN
AT INGLESIDE
Saplings Ran With
Vim and Dash.
THE BETTING WAS HEAVY

THE OLD DOGS SPRINT.
Silkwood Was Withdrawn, as He Is
Matched to Run a Stake Race
To-Day at San Jose â The
Probable Winners.
"Coursing is all right. I did not antici
pate the pleasure the afternoon afforded
me. It was the first time I witnessed a
coursing meeting, but you can rest satis
fied that in future I will be a stanch pat
ron of the game."
The foregoing remarks were made by
James Woodward, a prominent Eastern
sportsman, who is on a pleasure visit to
this coast. Mr. Woodward attended the
big meeting at Ingle?ide Park yesterday
and he retired from the grounds well sat-:
isfied with the sport, which he Unhesitat
ingly said was the most interesting of all
outdoor amusements. He will be present
in the company of several Eastern friends}
to witness the finals of the all-age and
sapling stakes which will be completed
this afternoon. The coursing yesterday
was of the very best, and why not? The
haresâ to use a familiar saying of Tom
my Hall, the Prince of the Merced cours
ing fraternity â had their running shoes
on and cut out merry clips for their pur
suers. The races were not as severe on
the dogts UK old timers have experienced,
that in, when the grass was short and
dry; still there wns enough hard running
to tent the good and bad qualities of the
hounds and also to a&tiufy the large and
enthusiastic crowd of sport lovers in at
tendance.
The day was most propitious for the
sport, and the betting was exceedingly
spirited. The sapling stake was the first
on the programme, and the dogs entered
for this event were occasioned very little
delay, in entering the slips. With the ex
ception of Belle Anderson, who sold first
choice in the betting, the favorites won
rather handsomely.'
In the all-aged stake there were a few
hard Upsets to the talent. Old Glory was
defeated by Gladiator, a 3 to 5 shot; Tul
lamore sent Hotstuff to his kennel minus
a Hag, and O'Grady romped away from
Victor Queen, who sold a strong favorite
at 2 to 1. :â¢ .
Silkwood was entered against Gilt Edge,
but his owner would â  not allow him to
compete, as he is matched to run against
Angeline to-day, best three in live
courses, at San Jose, for $230 a side. Last
Sunday Jack Sheehan, the judge of the
San Jose Coursing Association, decided
in favor of Silkwood, but the owner of
Angeline was of the opinion that his rep
resentative had won and a match race
resulted from an argument that followed.
It is dollars to little apples that Silkwood
will walk off with the long end of the
long green this afternoon.
Revolver ran a bye with Gilt' Edge and
won a comparatively easy course. Miss
Grizzle and Tod Sloan ran a no-go, but
in the run-off Miss Grizzle proved that
she was Tod's superior in the long run.

CROWNING DISCOVERY
OF THE CENTURY
A New System of Medicine Discovered by
an Eminent Scientistjfor the^ Positiv^
Cure of Consumption, Lung
Troubles^ and All Wasting
Diseases.
CONSUMPTION CAN BE CURED.
Do you cough? t
Do your lungs pain you?
Is your throat sore and inilamed?
Do you spit up phlegm?
Does your head ache?
Is your appetite bad?
Are you losing flesh?
Are you pale and thin?
Are your lungs delicate?
Do you lack stamina?
These symptoms are proof that y;>'i
have in your body the seeds of the most
dangerous malady that has ever devas- |
tatfd the carth â consumption.
Consumption, the bane of those who
have been brought up in the old-fash
ioned beliefs that this disease was here
ditary, that it was fatal, that none I
could recover who were once firmly
clasped in itr. relentless grip.
Bur. now. known to be curable, made
sn by the world-stirring discoveries of
that man whose name has been given to
tliis rf~w system of treatment.
Now known to be preventable and j
curable by following and practicing his !
hygienic teachings.
The new system of medicine will \
cure you of consumption and of all dis- I
eases which can be traced back to weak
lungs as a foundation.
It is not a drug system, but a system ;
of germ annihilation and body building.
Not guesswork, but science.
UNION MEN JOIN
HANDS IN THE DANCE
SUCCESSFUL BALL OF THE
BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL.
A Night at Scottish Hall to Be For
ever Marked With a White
Stone.
The ball of the Building Trades Coun
cil, in Scottish Hall last night, was a suc
cess, both socially and financially. Not
only this, but it was a general reunion of
the hundreds of men of different trades,
â¢who are bound together by the one tie,
"In union there is strength."
This ball is the first affair of the kind
ever run by the Building Trades Counfil
as it is to-day, and the members of the
body are naturally pleased at the success
of their first social venture. The year
past has given trades union men much to
be thankful forâ it marked the burial of
the hatchet between the two central bod
ies, which for a long time past have been
internally at war with one another, and
the dawn of a new era seems to be
breaking. Men affiliated with the two
one-time rival organizations met, chatted
pleasantly, danced with one another's
sweethearts and gave the winning; invita
tion to "have one with me."
Everybody of importance was there. P.
H. McCarthy, with his winning smile and
an extra curl on liis mustache, was la

out Jim Rose and Walter Goff. but Wal

his smiles were scarcer than usual, but
everybody knows "Billy" was there.

Miss Sophia H. Hutton installed the last
set of officers of the local Rebckah lodges
in Excelsior Hall last night. The installa
tion was public and the officers who were
inducted into office were those of Mission
Rebekah Lodge. In the work she was as
sisted by Miss Gussie Hooper as marshal.
The hall, which was beautifully decorated
with evergreens, flowers and colored lan
terns, was so crowded with members of
the order and friends that there was
hardly room for the officers to move to
their "respective stations.
The officers who were obligated and will
rule the lodge for the current term of six
months are: Miss Gertie Wimmer. past

FRYE URGES THE
RATIFICATION OF
TREATY OF PEACE
Declares That Owing to t\)e Pov
erty of SpaiQ the Best Terms
Possible Were Made.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28.â Senator
Frye continued his argument for the
ratification of the peace treaty with
Spain in to-day's executive session of
the Senate. He talked for <".n hour
and a half and again made the
h of the .. lon.
The principal questions under con
sideration to-day were those relating
to the payment of claims against the
Spanish Government, the reasons for
agreeing to pay Spain for the improve
ments made in the Philippines and ex
tending to Spain the benefit of an open
door policy in her former possessions.
There were various interruptions by
other Senators, who, however, confined
themselves to questions. In reply to
one of these questions relating to the
President's instructions, Frye said the
commissioners were in constant com
munication with the President and that
the latter bad cabled them to use their
best judgment in reaching conclusions.
Frye Bald that the question of claims
of American citizens against Spain had
required much time and had been the
subject of much â  anxious thought on
the part of the commission, but there
was no other practical solution of the
problem in view of the poverty of
Spain, and in fact no other policy was
compatible with the reputation of the
United States as a nation which knew
how to be generous a3 well as just.
He said there were about $12,000,000
of these claims and possibly the amount
might reach $15,000,000. Spain had
agreed as an offset to this concession
on our part to pay the claims of Spa
ish citizens against the United States
Government, but Frye admitted that
thÂ« aggregate of these counter claims
was not large.

GENERAL MERRIAM
WOULD GIVE SPAIN
THE PHILIPPINES
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 28.â Major Gen
eral H. C. Merriam left Los Aneeles
this morning on his way east from Sa.n
Francisco, where he has just been re
li^v^d by General Shafter, who goes
back to his old command. General Mer
riam will hereafter command the De
partment of the Colorado and reside
permanently in Denver.
General Merriam discussed freely the
policy of the Government toward the
Philippines. "I concede that tne senti
ment on this coast Is overwhelmingly in
favor of holding all we can get in the.
Orient." said Merriam. "This is nat
ural, in view of the trade advantages
which will accrue to merchants, but
in the East the sentiment against an
nexation or a protectorate is growing
rapidly. I concede that very great ad
vantages in trade would come from
holding the Islands, but the cost of
keeping so large a population In check
in a climate, bo unsuited to our Deople
as a permanent place of abode is too
heavy to justify bo radical a departure
from the traditions of our country."
When asked what he would do with
the islands, he did not shirk the aues
tion, but answered boldly:
1 would have let them alone. We
had no responsibility as to the DeoDle
of the islands. Should i be asked if I
would let Spain reassert authority oVer
the people I would say, 'Yes, if she
could do it,' " he said, with perfect
frankness.
â¢'I think expansion will lead this na
tion Into the most serious complications
with other powers, who are all hostile
to our holding the islands, and jealous
of our extending our sway." s h i <.l Mer
rlam. "I Bee no immediate necessity
for a large army. However, this L; v.
question of military policy. Every
thing depends upon the temper of Con
. If this body desires the reten
tion of territory captured it will be
necessary for it to supply men and
money."
In response to a direct question as to
his persona] opinion of the Philippines
Meniam said:
"Acaumlsg that the possession and
retention of these islands is decided
upon, that makes us responsible for the
behavior of ten millions of people of
â whom we know little except that they
are half savage. The islands are in a
climate not congenial to American sol-
diers or citizens. They are surrounded
by countries unfriendly both to us and
our style of government. History shows
come races have developed character

Telegraphic instructions of January 24,
directing the discharge of Private Harry
E. Sutton, Hospital Corps, Presidio of
San Francisco, are confirmed. Private
Frank H. Bates, Hospital Corps, now at
Presidio of San Francisco, will be dis
of the open door policy, but whether
or not the United States meant to
â¢ that policy upon the whole, he
ft it sure that history would commend
the course in the present instance. The
â¢ of the American commissioners
cure control of the Caroline Isl
ands was also explained, Frye stating
that the Spanish commissioners had
absolutely refused to discuss the prop
osition. "Our offer of Si. ! or the
islur.ds had a;> have no effect
whatever. Th< 'â  n declined in
the most ; positive manner to cede one
of the islands of this group as a cable
station.
Referring to the present situation in
th'- Philippines, Senator Tillman asked
Senator Frye if he was willing to have
troops tire on the Filipinos, to
which Frye replied that the firing stage
had not yet b< <a v ..â  hed there, and he
hoped that the treaty would soon be
ratified and this stage thus probably
averted for good. In conclusion he re
ferred to the great improvement in a
religious and spiritual way that would
result from American occupation of the
islands, saying that no man who would
have tho gospel preached to all nations
could view with equanimity the pros
tration of the islands to
:. or their partiti-:: â  iher
nations. To reject the treaty meant
the restoration of the status quo, to

put by .-â  snator Mason. The question
was whether it was the purpose of the
Unit- - to pay the 120,000,000 in
demnity until the United Stat"s should
come into full possession and occupa
tion of the country. "I want to knotv,"
the Illinois Senator said, "whether we
are to pay the money before the goods
are delivered.' 1
Davis referred Mason to the text of
treaty for his reply. He said the

are none of them distinguished fur in

are a mixture of Hindoo, Malay and
Chinese. The fact that Great Britain
hap accomplished wonders in India,
however, should be some encourage
ment to those of our people inclined to
adopt a similar policy, but I do not
believe these are in the majority."
When asked if military departments
would be reorganized as they were be
fore the war Merriam said:
"It is. a matter which Congress will
decide. The Departments of Columbia,
Dakota and Missouri were depleted by
drafts for troops for foreign s-ervice. If
the bill before Congress to increase the
standing army to 100.000 becomes a law
then these departments will be reparri
poned. It is not of the first importance
that these posts should be regarrisoned
â that is, not because of danger of In
dian drpredatic-ns. The Indians are
quiet now."
CORTEZ BROTHERS SEEK TO
REGAIN MANILA PROPERTY
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28.â The Cortez
brothers, two Philippine citizens now
in Washington, through Attorney
Ralstur, to-day made an argument be
fore Assistant Judge Advocate General
Morrison at the War Department to
skew why a large quantity of valuable
property in Manila, in the possession of
the United States military authorities,
should be restored to them.
Theee interests reach nearly a million
dollars, and about forty other claim
ants are in a similar position. This
property was seized by the Spanish
Government at Manila during the in
surrection preceding our own war, un
der the claims that the Cortez brothers
were rebels. The Spaniards collected
several thousand dollars monthly in
rentals from the property. Later on
they issued a proclamation stating that
the property would be restored to the
rightful owners upon their return to
Manila. But, the city being blockaded
by Dewey, the brothers could not have
reach*'! Manila, even had they chosen
to do so. So, when the American forces
captured the town they possessed
themselves of this property as part of
the Spanish Government property.
General Otis has confirmed this state
ment of the facts and has referred the
claim to the War Department for ad
judication.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 29, 1899.
B ETTER PAY FOR
SOME ATTACHES
Consular Salaries Also
Increased.
UNCLE SAM'S PARSIMONY
ONLY RICH YOUNG J&.EN CAN BE
LEGATION SECRETARIES.
An Interesting Debate in Which Gal
linger Calls Attention to the
Compensation of United
States Senators.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2Sâ A spirited
debate was precipitated in the Senate
to-day while the diplomatic and con
sular appropriation bill was under con
sideration. The appropriations com
mittee was sharply criticized for not
providing adequate salaries for some of
the consular ofTicers and secretaries of
legations of this Government in foreign
countries, and tho parsimony of the
Government in this respect was de
nounced as a disgrace.
Gallinger said he desired to call at
tention to the starvation wages paid
to the United States consular represen
tatives abroad.
Hale, in charge of the bill, explained
that the appropriation committee had
not considered the compensation of
consular officers, and suggested that
the Committee on Foreign Relations
take up the question and make some
recommendation.
'"Have you ever known," inquired
Cockrell of Missouri, "any applicant for
consulships to object to the salaries be
fore taking office?"
Replying to Cockrell Gallinger said
that his question was not in any sense
an argument.
"Senators," said Gallinger, "receive
15000 a* year. Many others would take
the position for half that sum. Some
men in Montana and other States, judg
ing from accounts in the newspapers,
are willing to pay a bonus for a seat
in this body. But that is no reason why
Senators should not receive decent
salaries; nor is it a reason why some
of the young men abroad should not be
paid proper salaries. Some of those
salaries are meanly inadequate. Our
consular service is verging in this re
spect upon what I deem disgraceful."
Morgan of Alabama offered an
amendment increasing the salaries of
the secretaries of legations in the Ar
gentine Republic, Venezuela, Peru, Li
beria ar.d Korea from $1500to$1800. Mor
ipoke at length on his amendment.
!!â â¢ said that our consular s< rvlce, In
South America particularly, was being
degraded and cut down. The positions
were taken by men who either them
selves or through their fathers had
private means with which to support
the social elegancies â one of the feat
ures of office holding in those coun
tries. He sharply criticised the United
Stat-s Government for its parsimonious
policy, declaring that it was a disgrace
to the country.
After further discussion the salaries
of secretaries of legation to the Argen
tine Republic, Venezuela and Peru were
increased from $1500 to $1800 and of the
consuls at La Guayama, Venezuela,
from $1800 to $2000, and at pernambuco,
Brazil, from $2000 to $2500. The allow
ance for clerks at consulates was in
creased from $1600 to $3 4 J00.
The salaries of three third secretaries
of embassy, at London, Paris and Ber
lin, were Oxed at $1600 each. The con
sulate at Naples was placed in the
class; the consulate at Colling
l, Canada, in th- $2000 class and
the consulate at Niagara Falls in the
â¢ lass.
The bill as amended was then passed.
At 2 o'clock the Senate took a n
until 3:30 and on reassembling th<*
ate, on motion of Davis, went immedi
ately into executive session.
ARGUMENT ON ARMY
REORGANIZATION BILL
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28.â The House
to-day continued the consideration of
the army reorganization bill until 2
o'clock, when the members paid their
tribute to the memory of the late Rep
resentative Simpkins of Massachusetts.
Very little progress was made with the
army bill, the only amendment, made
being that offered by the committee to
give veterinarians in cavalry regiments
the rank, pay and allowances of second
lieutenants. The time before the eulo
gies began was chiefly devoted to a
continuation of the debate on the ad
visability of retaining the Philippines.
During the debate on the army bill
Representative Loud of California sur
prised everybody by making a bitter
attack on the proposed increase. His
speech created something of a sensa
tion. He characterized Chairman
Hull's amendment, fixing the minimum
of 50,000 men, as a subterfuge. He told
his party associates that they could
not catch suckers with bare hook like
that. He advocated an army of 50.000.
and a certain number of volunteers to
be called out if needed. He said that
no system had been devised that would
pay the expenses of the proposed army
and wound up by advising the military
committee to withdraw its bill and re
organize its particulars.
Chairman Hull refused to -withdraw
hte bill. He said it could be reorgan
ized on the lloor. Cannon also defend
ed the bill against the assertions of
Loud. V. r a!ker of Massachusetts spoke
passionately on the expansion question,
claiming that the army named in the
bill was an absolute necessity. He
paid that no one would be more anxious
to r< duce the army than the President.
THE BRITISH NAVY
GREATLY STRENGTHENED
England Will Have More Ships Than
All the Other Nations in
the World.
LONDON, Jan. 28.â The record num
ber of British warships is now building,
amounting to 119 vessels, ranging from
the heaviest battleships to the tiny
torpedo boat destroyers, the figures be
ing 16 first-class ironclads, 36 cruisers,
14 sloops and gunboats and 53 torpedo
boat destroyers. Chatham dockyard is
credited with the unparalleled achieve
ment of launching three of the heaviest
battleships from the same slip within
ten months. The armored ships build
ing at a cost of over Â£26,000,000 number
twenty-eight, with a tonnage of over
350,000 tons, the number exceeding by
two the entire Russian fleet of battle
ships and treble the number of armored
vessels in the American navy. The
whole of these ships will be added to
the effective strength of the British
navy by March 1, 1903. while the First
Lord of the Admiralty, George J.
Goschen, in two months* time will ask
the House of Commons for credits to
still further strengthen the British
fleet. â  .
ALGER'S SUCCESSOR
SOON TO BE NAMED
Ex=Governor Merriam of Minne=
sota Seems Slated for
the Place.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 28.â Mr. Hitchcock, Secretary of the Interior,
has started from his post at St. Petersburg for this country, and is ex
pected to reach Washtngton within the next ten days. Mr. Bliss will
hold on until his successor arrives. It is said that Mr. McKinlev
hopes to be able at that time to announce the name of a Secretary of
War. The report of the Aleer relief commission will be handed to
the President, it is said, some time next week, and Mr. Alger will
no longer have the excuse of not wishing to retire under fire. No
serious apprehension, however, is felt on that score by Mr. Alger or
his friends. It is still thought that former Governor W. R. Merriam
of Minnesota will succeed Secretary Alger.
The report has been revived that Secretary Long intends to with
draw from the Cabinet some time during the coming spring or sum
mer. His health is not very good, and this is advanced as the rea
son for his wishing to retire. If he goes out his successor probably
will come from New York or New England. That New York will
make a grab for the place goes without saying. Her citizens feel very
keenly the loss of prestige to the Empire State through her not
having a representative in the Cabinet. It will be a condition that
has never existed before in any Republican administration.

Admiral William T. Sampson to-night,
and principal among the other guests was
tary of the Navy John D. Long.
Secretary Long made an address in which
he referred to Admiral Sampson's action
â¢ luring the movements around Santiago.
He said Sampson was given his orders to
be carried out, and the desired result was
accomplished. It was, he said, of no more
consequence that Sampson was seven
miles away at the time of the fierce en
gagement at Santiago than it was that
Grant was at Chattanooga during the
fight at Missionary Ridge.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 28.â People re
siding in the neighborhood of Larkspur
are at a loss to understand why fortune
seekers should brave the wintry bJasis
of the Klondike in search of gold when
they can find the genuine article within
an hour's ride of San Francisco. The
discovery of a gold mine by Jean E3
calle, a prominent winemaker, resid
ing near Larkspur, has caused no little
excitement in the neighborhood and the
surrounding hills are being diligently
prospected for the yellow metal.
Escalle found his mine about a year
ago, but kept the secret so well that
the public had been in ignorance that
treasure lies undeveloped so near. The
recent visit of Alfred Kelly of the Hi
bernia Bank, in company with an ex
! pert', has given wide publicity to Es
. calle's good fortune and it is now on
the tip of every one's tongue.
The mine is situated on a spur of |
Tamalpais Mountain, within 200 yards
of the track of the San Francisco and
North Pacific Coast Railroad. The vein
lies in a deep, rocky gully. It was dis
covered by Escalle while he was boring
for water. Specimens were sent to
Jean Jehu of San Francisco and his
ass&y places a value of $1 45 a ton.
These specimens, however, were taken
from the surface, and, it is asserted, do
not show the true richness of the ore.
At present the shaft, which has been
sunk a distance of thirty-five feet, is i
filled with water and no work can be |
done. Escalle is in no hurry to de
velop his property and says he will
wait until the rainy season is over. He
is confident that it will prove valuable
and has tref used an offer from a San
Francisco mining man to take out the
ore and pay him a royalty of 26 per
cent.
C. W. Wright, president of the Amer
ican .Land and Trust Company, who
owns 'most of the property in the vicin
itiy of Larkspur, has found gold above
i Escalle's rriine.

Dr W S. Rice of 418 B Main street, Adams,

any rupture, no matter how old or seve Â» Â«
case it may be. It would be good news II he
only assured his patients of comfort, but

the publication of his .
cured patients, Mr. H. G. Brown of E
Or., a fine old gentleman, consented to
his picture to accompany his statement :
Ing the marvelous cure which Dr. Kice caused
in his case.
! Mr. Brown says: "I am very happy to ac-
I knowledse that Dr. Rice's method completely
cured me of a dangerous rupture. I have since
! done all kinds of hard work on a farm and
I have been as strong and capable as in my
j younger days before being ruptured. II all
, ruptured people would try this method I am
f certain they would be cured, as Dr. Rice baa
, a system that is simpie, cheap, comfortable.
I heal'insr and satisfactory to such a degree that
from the very first day a man !â

1 METEOROLOGICAL MYSTERY
LOVELIEST WEATHER SCARES
THE STATE.
Salifornia Still Heating Under the
Hottest Winter Sun It Has
Known â The Why of
the Phenomenon.
â â¢>; : This is the most sensational weather
" : ."X.haj, California ever weathered since the
v-.vrhite man came to these parts. There is
." s.omo oat physical mystery back of it.
â â¢bVit in the absence of any evidence that
:i..;the:' earth has suddenly changed the in
:.-:cHnation of its axis there is no clew to
â¢' -the solution of the mystery.
â¢; f-- The State has bad five days of the hot
â¢*;-,t.est weather the records record, not only
';â â  .for. January, but for the whole three
v/.' ."winter" months of December, January
â¢..ahd February.
f â â  â Furtfiermore, the memory of man can
.":' hot rocali a week of past winter weather
â  â¢..lti^Callfornia which was so nearly perfect
\'-\-^po evenly tempered to the blood, having
â¢such cloudless skies, such still and balmy
'. airs, such clear visions of distant heights,
.'Vs.uch ardent wooings of buds and blos
:;â¢ :><ims, such temptations to go afield.
/â 'There is hardly a resident of the State
."â¢lie'low the snow and frost lines that has
\>*iot said daily: "Isn't this a glorious
;..:Â£ay?" *
:,y_ 'If Lowell had been writing that poem in
i .Calif arnia during the past week he would
; ; y-iave penned:
v,.V-An<i what is so rare as a day in January 7
:. . :.Then, ii ever, con perfect days.
:;.,'-Tis as ca?y then for the heart to be true
'â¢â  â¢,sâ ;; for grass to bo green or the Flues to bo blue,
;â â .â¢'â¢ '-'.Ti3 the naturai way of living.
â â¢;â¢"â¢ 'And at these perfect, peaceful, blessed
.'clays the State is beginning to fairly shud-
X'jd'er. in fright.
:â ' '''"Rain! Rain!" say people who look
:.;' ahead. "Are we going to have another
.'â¢;\<;urÃed dry year? And then this summer
'â ' .Wpather will start all the fruit buds and
'â¢'â¢the-; blossoms and the wneat to growing,
'; Find then .the frosts will come â Great
â ': Scott! And haps hardly any more rain
,;;on. top of that. This is glorious winter
â weather, but Oh, my!"
:..". This magnificent spell of climate is in
:'â -. teresting in more ways than one. It is a
. :: '.'. tefiular record-breaker all around. On
.'. Ne\v Year' a day it began to rain after a
</--y.ni-z throat of another dry year and peo
-.f.. : : ple; voiced a glad ah: It "rained for a
â¢:.:w*ek and "the farmers were jubilant."
â¢.:.and so were others. Then it turned off
I.nice fcr a week and then it got nicer.
::.':. About Hve days ago it began to warm
''â¢tip.- It warmed up first along the coast
â  Ai-nd it has boon steadily warming up all
through the interior and it is still tiring
iijtrp.; On Thursday San Francisco had the
: .."Warmest winter day in its recorded me
" \teerolGgical history. It registered 7S de

â  -has tho daily record been broken, but the
' â¢\v.t-a;her spell is phenomenal for its con
' tihuance. It is still warmer in the in
.* terior. but this San Francisco record Is
â¢ ;.typlcal of the whole State, for the whole
. â .â¢S.Ui.te is governed by a general weather
â¢â â¢â¢â Con.dUion. >
. ; '.' : -..The natural philosophy of it all Is this:
â â¢â¢â¢Succeeding the long early January storm
; a groat area of hieh pressure settled over
â¢ :.t'h.e west and northwest, keeping out any
: ocean storms that might drift this way.
A week apo this "high" got shaped into
.a long sort of ridge of high pressure,
' atrttchinar from the Oregon coast to Utah.
Naturally, the air currents have been
pouring out from it in all directions. Cali
fornia has for days received such steady
â 'â¢currents from over the Siskiyou Mo in
.â¢â¢Xains and over the .-â¢:.. Nevadas. We
have been having a "norther." No wind
' frtim the sea has chilled the State sine*
Sunday or Monday last. This dry north
wind lias been steadily warmed up by the
â¢FJUn from a clear skj- as it traveled south.
Mt'is the wind from over the Siskiyoua
. from Oregon, warmed through its long
'.'.travel down the Sacramento Valley that
'has given San Francisco its warm weath
,:..'f>r. At first the currents from over the
â â  â¢Kierra Nevadas predominated in the San
"â '.â Joaquin Valley and the interior kept
â 'â â 'â - :'steadily a fc-w degrees cooler than San
â¢ â¢'Kr-JuK'ii-co. Thursday was the city's hot
:â¢'â¢ t^i-'t <Jay. 1-ut the interior has kept warm
:â¢::â¢ Jri.LT Up I dally and to-day may be hotter
ever. Yesterday El Verano, in Son
:-'-'>'iTiii County: and Indio and Pomona, in
California, had 85 degrees. Hay-
: -w;>idÂ« Napa and other places registered
I'zih: -degrees. The whole Interior of the
â â¢â  : 'S'.a'te stood at between 70 and SO degrees.
ivX\Until that "high" lets go the only cool-
will be the sea air, and that
â â¢'Wim How in iust as soon as the land i -m-
â  =. : VÂ»--nture gets above that of he sea air.
'â â i iliC-r two or three days there has been
N : 'tiejarly an even balance. On Friday
.â¢j'.*vtehlng tho shifting balance let a very
y.-fcyhtle draught of sea air reach the city,
;: ; s. in mo.-.- may come at any time, almost
â 'â 'â . lately. If the interior warms up

CARS ON SAN BRUNO ROAD.
The Electric Line Had Its Trial Trip
Yesterday, Which Was Successful.
A trial trip of the new electric cars
over the San Bruno road was success
fully made yesterday afternoon. At 2:30
o'clock Constructor H. H. Lynch, Michael
D. Stein, division superintendent, S. L.
Foster, G. H. Fairchild and Foreman of
Constructions Thomas B. Egan, with
John "P. Graham, president of the Precita
Valley Improvement Club, a Call repre
sentative and a few other invited guests
boarded one of the Folsom street cars at
Precita avenue and Folsom and started
over the new line. The trip, a distance
of three miles, was made in fifteen min
utes without a hitch. As the pioneer car
passed along the roadway the inhaoitants
deserted their houses and rushed to the
roadside to hail the first electric car over
that line. _ _ . ,
On the return trip the railroad officials
were greeted with one continuous round
of cheering from men, women ana chil
dren who had congregated along the car
track to salute those who had opened the
road for quick travel.
The present line runs over the ono here
tofore traveled by the horse car since the
Omnibus line was built twelve years ago.
Its terminus is at the Five Mile Houce.
Later in the afternoon Superintendent
Vining. with a few invited friends, went
over the line and was very much pleased
with its construction, so much so that ha
publicly congratulated Constructor Lynch
and Foreman Egan for the excellence of
their work. By an improved protest of
pouring melted metal into the Joints at
the end of each rail the old systjm of
bolting the rails to the sleepers is obvi
ated and the rail becomes one solid bar
from end to end, thus preventing that
jolting motion experienced on cheaply
constructed ros well as tiie es
cape of the motive power.
Superintendent Vining has made sr
ranK-rnents by which transfers will bo
â  : as follows: Every second car of
tlit- Fnlfcom street line leaving the ferry
will continue out Prectia avenue to the
end of the line, returning by the way of
Army st:eet and switching into Folsom.

DEANE WILL PRFVENT
JURY-BOX STUFFING
UNUSUAL PRECAUTIONS ARE
TAKEN THIS lERM.
Old Slips Are All Burned in the Pres
ence of the Presiding Judge and
He Will Seal the Box.
Jury-box stuffing, owing to the precau
tions tak^n by County Clerk William A.
Deane, will worry no Judge or other offi
cial this term. The appearance of names
in the Jury box that did not belong there
has long been a cause of anxiety and
scandal, but the little gamo of drawing
a juror's salary illegally is now at an
end.
At the Instance of County Clerk Deane
the big jury box was carried before Pre
siding Judge Daingerfield yesterday and
an order was made by the court that all
the old names, some 3000 in number, were
ordered withdrawn and consigned to the
flames. With the j order in hand Chief
Deputy Goddard caused the box toÂ» be
carried Into the Grand Jury room. Judge
Daingerfield followed, a fire was kindled
in the grate and the little slips of paper
were soon in ashes. "If your honor pleas,e ;
I would ask that you inspect the box,'
said Mr. GodUard, "in order to be assured
that no names or slips remain therein.
Judge Daingerfield took a match, lit it,
and after inserting it through the little
opening, made a careful inspection. No
names remained in the box and the work
of folding the new names and dropping
them in the box was begun. The names
of 2400 citizens,, selected by the Superior
Court in bank, were ordered written on
the slips by County Clerk Deane by one
man. The" writer of the slips employed
an artistic but unusual hand in which to
write the slips, and in event any name

SEEKING THE
LAUNCH SUNK
BY THE OAKLAND
Divers Have Located
the William D.
WINE AND SPIRITS FOR MANILA
A CARGO GOING OVER ON THE
SCHOONER BESSIE STEVENS.
Menagerie on the Wallacetown â A
Change of Captains on the
Henry B. Hyde â The
Seawall Repaired.
The launch William D, sunk in col
lision with the ferry steamer Oakland last
Sunday, is still at the bottom of the bay.
During the week men in whitehalls have
be< .1 dragging: for her, but it was only
yesterday that the hull was located. Di
vers Roach and Martin have undertaken
to raise the launch, but they find great
difficulty in making anything fast to the
sunken launch. They were out in the
launch Amy during the day, and after
the men in the Whitehall boats had lo
cated the wreck they tried to make fast
to It with grappling irons, but failed. The
William D is evidently lying in the mm.
bottom up. The upper works are sunk
in the soft ooze, so that the only thing
to get hold of is the rudder and screw.
Once a hold is secured there will not be
much trouble in passing a sling under
the hull and hauling her into shallow
water.
Boatmen and others are keeping a
bright lookout for the bodies of the
lads. Seabury and Finn were probably
drowned last Friday, and their remains
will come to the surface to-day, while the
body of young Wattles, who was drowned
in the collision, will not Moat until to
morrow. It will probably come up near
Goat Island, as there is a big sink there,
caused by the eddy from the southerly
end of the island, into which everything
that goes down near it is carried.
The little schooner Bessie E. Stevens is
being fitted out for a voyage to Manila.
She is only twenty-five tons burden, and
came here from Seattle. She was eigh
teen days coming down, and Captain Hes
ner says she rode out the gales like a
bird. The Stevens will take a cargo of
about forty tons to Manila. It will oe
composed almost entirely of whisky and
California wines, so the native sons now
in the Philippines will be able to drink
the vintage of the Golden State as soon
as the Stevens reaches Manila.
The schooners Gotaina, Viking and Mel
nncthon arrived from Coos Bay yester
day in a bunch. They crossed out Bye
days ago in company, kept together all
the way down the coast and came in over
the bar together. Captain Johannessen
of the Gotama says that given a fair
wind and his vessel would have beafen
the others. Captain Peterson of the Vik
ing says the run was a coincidence, and
that his vessel is the fastest, while Cap
tain Olsen nf the Melancthon says he
will give the Viking and the Gotama a Hve
mile start over the same course and beat
them. The next time the schooners sail
in company there will be plenty of sail
carried.
The British ship "Wallacetown, now ly
ing at section 3 of the seawall, at first
glance might be mistaken fur a portion
of the Mission Park and Zoo. Captain
Motley and bis wife have been gathering
curios from all parts of the world, and in
consequence there are all kinds of things
living and dead on the ship. There are
canaries from Antwerp, parrots from
Australia, peacocks from France, pigeons
from the Cape of Good Hope, a wildcat
from Chile, a fox-terru-r from England
and a host of other things. For the
smaller birds Mrs. Motiey has an aviary,
but the animals and peacocks roam the
deck at will. The wildcat is as tame as
a kitten, and it and the fox-terrier are
great friends. Captain Motley says the
cat is the best ratter he has ever seen.
The cabin is a regular bower with flowers
and tropical plants growing in swinging
trays like the famous gardens of Baby
lon.
The American ship Henry B. Hyde sails
in a few dnys*>r Honolulu to load .sugar
for New YorWP Captain Colcord will not
go out in her, however, as he and his wife
are going back to thoir home in the East.
Captain Lenbner is now on his way here
from New York to take command of the
Hyde.
Repairs to the. seawall are now almost
completed. The norther and the high
tides carried away nearly all the earth
filling at sections 2 and .1. while the south
easter and the high tides played havoc
with East street between Market and Fol
som. Chief Engineer Holmes and Assist
ant Chief Ryan of the Harbor Commis
sion did not let the grass grow under
their feet. Gangs of men from the belt
railroad under the foremanship of Fred
Raabe were pat to work and kept at it
day and night until now the wall is in
better condition than It was before the
storms.
No Embezzlement Proved.
The charge of felony embezzlement
against W. J. Dunn, pool seller, preferred
by his former partner, Sidney H. Perry,
was dismissed by Judge Graham yester
day. Dunn swore that he loaned Perry
$150. and got the book-making machine,
which he. was charged with embezzling,
as security. Perry denied getting the
money, hut it was shown that Dunn was
always ready to give up the machine and
could not therefore be accused of embez
zling it.

SHEEHAN
Tax Collector Wants
More Clerks.
MAY INVOKE AID OF THE LAW
THREATENS TO REPORT MEM
BERS TO GRAND JURY.
Definite Action Will Be Outlined Af
ter the Stand Taken by the
Board at Its Meeting
on Monday.
Tax Collector Edward I. Sheehan has
ceased hostilities with the Supervisors
in the battle over the appropriation for
his office until Monday, at the regular
meeting of the board. Unless the matter
is adjusted at that time he threatens sum
mary proceedings against the men whom
he charges with interfering with the busi
ness of the cltv.
At the meeting of the Finance Com
mittee on Friday he insisted that tho
votes of the members be recorded on the
matter of allowing the extra appropria-
tlon to his office. He directed his request !
particularly to Supervisor Attrldge. When
asked yesterday what his purpose was In !
the matter he said he would report the j
men to the Grand Jury and charge them
with crippling his department if the mat- I
ter were not satisfactorily settled.
As to the contention he has raised as to j
the date upon which the new charter
takes effect, he holds that there is a wide
difterence of opinion and that it should
be settled now rather than at a later I
date. The fact of the charter carrying a
date docs not settle it definitely, he says,
as it cannot run counter to the constitu
tion. This latter instrument, according to i
some lawyers, makes the charter opera
tive so soon as it is approved by the
Legislature.
Mayor Phelan. Clerk Russell and other
authorities on the new organic law hold j
different views In the premises, saying '
there must be some specified time for it
to go into effect, otherwise there would
be endless confusion. The matter has
been referred to the City and County At
torney for his opinion, which will be
awaited with interest by the army of j
office holders and by the citizens at large
If he holds that it is in operation he wili
upset the present city government and
create much friction.
On the question of extra clerks Mr
Sheehan Fays he will make an aggres
sive light, to the end that his office may
be placed on such a footing as will enable I
it to handle the volume of business which !
the collection of the city's taxes entails
The proceedings of the Supervisors ori
Monday should be enlivened by the open

Government. He has been notified of his
appointment as Consul General at Porto
Rico, yicc George W. Crawford, deceased,
which position has measurably increased

ONLY A BOLOGNA
IN THE BARREL
Why Badger-Baiting Is No Longer
Popular With Some of the
Men About Town.
THERE Is not a bookmaker in town who would not consider it
equivalent to a challenge to combat to ask him to lay odds on a
badger-baitting contest now; or for that matter on any other noc
turnal sport with which Walter Scott Hobart had anything to do.
They had some experience in that line one night last week and it proved
neither profitable nor exhilarating.
The trouble occurred in this manner: Several days ago Mr. Hobart
passed the tip around to a number of his friends and acquaintances of
sporting proclivities that he had arranged for a badger-baiting match
out at Trocadero that night, and that carriages would be in waiting to
convey the party to the place of combat. It was stated that the beet
badger dog in the State had been brought down from Sacramento espe
cially for the occasion, and that he w r as warranted to whip any badger
that ever sought refuge in a hollow log. The baiting, it was given out,
had been arranged for the particular amusement of several Eastern
gentlemen who had never witnessed that form of sport, but who were
assured that a dog fight was not a marker to it. Besides, there would
be something else doing before the night was over.
There was, and lots of it.
The carriages were in readiness at the appointed time and so were
the guests. Not one was missing and the Palace Hotel court had a de
serted appearance that night. It was dark and the roads after getting
well out of town, were in a mushy condition, but all went well until the
party reached a point near the entrance to the long lane leading down
to Trocadero. The carriages stopped and the drivers declared their ut
ter inability to proceed any farther because of the horrible condition
of the roads.
Undaunted by this announcement, the sports clambered out of the
vehicles and proceeded on foot to their destination. On they floun
dered through mud too deep for teams, and after an hour's wallowing
they arrived at the wayside inn, exhausted and in such a woeful state
that they were denied the privilege of washing off in the horse trough
until after they had scraped away the outer covering of clay with chips.
But the dog was there with his owner, capering about a stout looking
barrel standing in a conspicuous place that it was whispered contained
the badger. These accoutrements dissipated in a measure the misery of
the unfortunates, and after making themselves fairly presentable and
trying a liquid application for cold feet, they announced themselves
ready for the entertainment. Everybody crowded around the barrel and
bets "began to be laid on the outcome. The Eastern contingent, with
no knowledge of the game and only a hazy idea of the prowess of the
badger, rather favored that quadruped, while the race track men, rely
ing on Hobarfs quiet tip on the good qualities of the dog, parted them
selves from their money unhesitatingly on that end of the proposition.
It was funny to hear that crowd of sports talk about badger-ba.iting.
It is doubtful if there were three among them who had ever witnessed
such a mill, but the way they discussed the merits of the two animals
was enough to stave in the barrel.
When the last cent In the party had been staked Hobart suddenly
gave a warning cry and kicked over the barrel. There was a wild
stampede of sports, who momentarily expected that badger to couple
onto them, but one by one they rounded themselves up and looked back.
The dog sat on his haunches, an air of unspeakable disgust enveloping
him, while Hobart and one or two attaches of the house were examin
ing the badger that lay on the ground.
Gradually the sports returned, inquiring as they approached if it was
all over. Then their eyes fell upon the late occupant of the barrel and
the flow of eloquence that followed has never been surpassed at any
gathering.
For instead of a badger Mr. Hobart had thoughtfully provided a
nice, large, fat, succulent bologna sausage for that Sacramento canine
to chew on.
Sadly those sports hit the back trail to the carriages, nor would
they listen to their host's explanations. They didn't want any explain
ing then; what they longed for Just then was solitude and a stone pave
ment.
Laboriously they toiled up the long hill only to find that every car
riage had disappeared. Then the torrent of eloquence broke forth anew,
but oratory did not help them to any appreciable extent, so for the third
time they plowed their way through the mire and hours after mid
night found them again at the hostelry.
Now, Trocadero boasts of only four guest chambers, which were to
tally inadequate to accommodate that party, but after another hoeing
down the tired sports distributed themselves as best they could In the
chairs and on the floor. Their sleep was profound after their night's
adventure, and it was late in the morning when the first of the outfit
was astir. He had drawn one of the four beds and before retiring had
shed his bedraggled raiment. It had vanished like the carriages the
night before, and his troubles broke out anew. But there were othersâ
in fact all of them â and there was a mad scramble for coats, shoes and
such other articles as could be spared by those who had camped down
stairs.
Finally one of the number made a search of the big fireplace in the Â£
gÂ« dining-room and discovered, tucked way up the chimney, the missing ?
t articles. It was difficult to identify them through the layers of mud SS
S3 and soot, but eventually each man. was fitted out, only to find fresh Â£.
â¦ troubles. Some who had turned in with a comfortable sum of money â  +
â¢I in their pockets, found themselves broke, while others who had been Â§5
*f practically in that condition the night before located bonanzas in their A
X clothes and right there began to appreciate the humor of the whole af-
4 fair. After much difficulty a redistribution of property was made and 2S

Seventy-First New York
Volunteers.
The entertainment to be given at Odd
Fellows 1 Hall on Thursday. February 2,
for the benefit of Private Henry Martin,
Company E. Seventy-first New York Vcl
entecrs, should appeal to the patriotism
and generosity of the public, for he is In
every way worthy of assistance.
The vounr nvm wÂ» s wounded on July 4
IBEt in the taking of the blockhouse at
San Juan Hill. He was brought to Mon
tauk Point, Long Island, placed In a hos
pital tent, and a tag put on him calling
for the amputation of his leg. He was
resolved not to lose his limb, and crawled
out of the tent and rejoined his regiment,
which was camped near by. Since then
he has received his honorable discharge,
through the aid of Colonel Roosevelt and
ex-Congressman Quigg of New York. He
came to this city, hoping that the milder
climate would help him in the aavng of
the injured limb. While he is willing to
work and has performed odd services now
nnd then the wounded leg needs atten
tion, and t is with this object in view that
Mrs W Ralph Elliott and other ladles
have interested themselves in the unfor
tunate Martin, and the benefit perform;
ance for which the Columbian Ladies'
Minstrels and other local talent have

The tickets for reserved seats are on

best and any one will be aiding a deserv

Last Friday night the membership of

gave a cake walk in Washington Hal!,
\vhlch was crowded to its utmost capac
ity There were four couples who gave
an exhibition of how to walk to the time
of popular music each couple being
blacked up and attired in very attrac
tive coatumes. The judges decided that
the most graceful couple were Police Of
ficer Henry Janes and his daughter and
the applause that followed the decision
was an evidence that the judges were not
in error During the evening there was
a short programme which had for its
most attractive feature a walk by two
little pickaninnies, and their imitation of
the older ones was a decided hit. Danc
ing followed the programme and all had
a very pleasant time. *. , *
Pocahontas Council will give a bask at
social and hop in Laurel Hall, Shiels

16th of February.
His Life in Danger.
H. W. Gendar, 1811 Devisadero street,
swore to a complaint in Judge. Graham's
court yesterday for the arrest of "John
Doe." a race track sport, on the charge
of battery. Gendar and his friend, Wil
liam H. Brown, were leaving the Co
lumbia Theater January 20, when Brown
made a remark to Gendar about hurry
ing to catch a car. "John Doe," DOaei
bly imagining that the remark was in
tended for him, turned round and struck
Brown a blow on the neck that knocked
him down. Thr.ee physicians have reen
in attendance upon Brown, and his life is
still in danger.

BRYAN'S WARNING
TO DICK CHOKER
Advice the New Yorker
Scorned.
READ OUT OF THE PARTY
CONTENTS OF A LETTER MADE
PUBLIC.
Declared That if Tammany Repu
diated the Chicago Platform
It Would Be Considered
Hostile.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW TORK, Jan. 2S.â The following
letter from William J. Bryan to Willis
J. Abbott, written in March, 189S, was
Kiven out by Mr. Abbott to-day. Mr.
Abbott explains th â  circumstances in
connection with it as follows:
In March. 1898, some of Mr. Bryan's ad
mirers In New York learned that he ex
pected to be in the East in the following,
month and would pass through New York.
They came to me, baying that a reception
should be tendered him and that he should
be â  â â â¢': to speak. l responded that in
my opinion the regular Democratic or
ganization should be the one to give the
reception and that Mr. Bryan ought not
to be asked to speak under my auspices.
I consulted Mr. Carroll, and was by -him
referred to Mr. Croker. Mr. Croker "asked
me to write to Mr. Bryan and rind out
whether he would be willing to speak in
New York, but refrain from discussing
the money question, i wrote to Mr. Bryan
accordingly, and received the answer
which follows.
This letter I wrote to Mr. Croker at the
Democratic Club, in order that he might
nave no illusion concerning Mr. Bryan's
position. As Mr. Croker has now definite
ly antagonized the Democrats who hold
to the Chicago platform, it is the belief
of many friends of Mr. Bryan that- this
letter in which he declares that New
York Democrats should stiow their hands
or accept the hostility of the members of
the party in the South and West should
be made public:
,_.... _ "March 16, 1593.
Willis J. Abbott, New Yorkâ My Dear
Abbott: I am just In receipt of your let
ter. Please say to Mr. Croker that I shall
riot be able to come East until about
April 13. At that time I shall be pleased to
meet him and talk over the political situ
ation. If, as 1 have heard, he is com
pelled to leave for Europe before that
time, express my regret to him.
'1 appreciate his Invitation to speak
there, but be will, upon reflection, realize
that I could not afford to make a speech
upon the lines suggested. The national
platform declares the money question to
be the paramount issue and 1 fully in
dorse that question. So believing I could
not directly or Indirectly encourage any
State to abandon the national platform.
While the Democrats of the West and
South have no right to force the national
platform upon the people of New York,
yet the Democracy of the nation does
have a right to expect the Democrats of
New York to stand by the platform or an
nounce their hostility. We ought to know
whether the New York Democracy means
peace or war.
"To ignore the national platform in a
State convention will be notice that the
Democrats of New York are hostile to
that platform, but lack the courage to de
clare it openly.
"The platform of 1896 will be reaffirmed
In 1900. and I for one would like to know
as soon as possible whether we are to re
gard the New York Democrats as allies
or enemies. If the Democrats of New
York invite me to speak while in the East
1 shall accept the Invitation with pleas
ure, but it must be with an understanding
that 1 .shall not be restricted as to the
subject of discussion. â  I do not care to be
a guest where the Chicago platform is
denied a hearing.
"1 believe that the restoration of bi
metallism is necessary and that 10 to 1 is
the only ratio at which bimetallism can
be restored, and I have no right to ex
pect favors from those who are hostile
to this doctrine. I can say to bimetallism
at 16 to 1 as Ruth said to Naomi: "En
treat me not to leave thee, or to return
from following after thee; for whither
thou goest 1 will go. and where thou
lodgest I will lodge. Thy people shall be my
people and thy God my God. Where thou
diest will I die and there will 1 be buried.
The Lord do so to me and more also if
aught but death part thee and me.'
"No one is compelled to accept my judg
ment and I must myself be guided by it,
and in my judgment the attempt to chain
the nation to a gold standard is so cruel
and wicked that 1 would be beneath con
tempt if 1 should trade my convictions
upon this subject for any political ad
vantage which the New York Democrats
might be willing to offer.
"Let me add another word: It is not
only right that -the New York State con
vention should stand by the Chicago plat
form, but it is good policy. Bimetallism
â¢will be as strong in New York when it Is
fully understood .is it is now in the West
and South, and the sooner the Democracy
of New York gins the defense of the
Chicago platform the sooner the- work
of education will be completed.' To ig
nore the platform when all the States
west and south indorse it will have all the
force of a declaration against the plat
form, and such a course will make it
more dlfllcult .to indorse the platform
hereafter.
"We were embarrassed in the last cam
paign by the fact that the Democrats of
your State went t<i Chicago to oppose the
platform which was adocted. Unless the
party in New York expects to repeat this
experiment In 1900 it should lose no time
in taking a firm stand upon the Chicago
platform, in urging this course upon
Tammany and the Democracy ot" New
York I ought to suggest that" the party
in New York has something at stake as
well as the party in the fiation.
"Tammany needs the Democracy of the
nation as much as the national party
needs Tammany, and Tammany should
nlse this fact. Democratic princi
ples have too firm a hold upon the plain
people to give the party In any section
ruiy promise of success by abandoning
them. Democracy was defined at Chicago
and the definition Is ro satisfactory that
no material change will be made In thpt

A Tale of Wong and Bun Tuck.
The Right Hon. Richard Seddon, Pre
mier of New Zealand, will be known for
ever and a day as Bun Tuck, the Eng
lish partner in a mining syndicate of the
days of long ago. George Hutchison,
the irrepressible member for Patea, some
two months back announced that Mr.
Seddon had once "gone whacks with two
itialÃ in a gold claim. The Premier
vigorously denounced the base insinua
tion, consequently Mr. Hutchison threat
ened to produce a duly signed statement
made by one of the Premier s L hinese
partners. He did so, and read it in the
House. Here It la: t
"Listen to me: Wong Shung V\ ai and
Tsai Chung (Which is this narrator) were
gold picking ai Knappers Gully on the
Six-mile Run. He who rules the Govern
ment came to our camp one night. We
had heard of him before, and we were
alarmed. He had to be with everything
at the place called Stafford Town. His
name among the English was Dick Bed
don. After we had eaten rice he had
much talk with Worn;, who was very
learned in all languages. He could talk
In the language of the country as much
as the Mandarin Seddon. Then they did
some writing, and this narrator also put
names to the end of the writing. When
the mandarin had gone Wong told this
narrator that we were row brothers In
the claim, but that our brotherhood was
not to he talked of. Wons s:iid that Sed
don would be known as Bun Tuck. He
said our brother was powerful before the
warden as an advocate, and sometimes
vint to the place of government and was
feared there for his great talk. Wong
was also a person of much talk, but our
people did not always listen to him. He
said Bun Tuck was very clever, but not
clever enough. We had plenty provisions
then, and we had much joy, and our per
spiration ran very free. One day Wong
went away, because the constable wa.s
looking for him. He only left a message
to say that he had been like a rat drag
ging a shovel, and that our claim was
sold to a number of while devils, and
that I had b< tter leave the place quietly.
I'.ut this narrator was very poor. I had
entered my <Mflin. as they say in China,
and been buried, so I went to Bun Tuck.
But he raised the wratn matter and told
mo I was descended from stupid people.
He said, moreover, Wong Shung Wai had
got the best of the squeeze. Nevertheless,
he gave me 20 taels. This narrator then
nr far away. 1 went to China, but
have since returned. Bun Tuck is much
changed Blnce then, but I know him when
I B( c him. Declared by Tsai Chung as a
true history, and Figni-d by him."
Of course Mr. Seddon was furious, and
demanded the withdrawal of what he sad
v. as nothing but a skit. The member for
Patea declared solemnly that the state
ment was actual fact, and that he would
not withdraw it, so into Hansard "Bun
Tuck" has entered in all his glory.â Pall

A Misunderstanding.
There was a new ticket agent at Cadil
lac for the Grand Rapids and Indiana
road. One of his first patrons was a big
rough man. with a voice to match.
"Mossback," said the big man, as he
laid a $.", bill on the shelf.
"Say," responded the new agent. "I sup
pose that you are one of. these wild West
erners that think they are born terrors
who can insult everybody with impunity
But you've waked up the wrong passenger
this time."
"What's gnawin' you. young feller?
Haint you the ticket agent?"
"Yes; but I haven't hired out to be
abused. You can't come around here call
ing me names and get away with it."
"I guess you must 1"' w'heely. I said
Mossback, I mean Mosshark, a"nd 1 want
to take a Mossback train."
"Just you Btep aside till I get through
with the rest of these people, and I'll
make you wish you'd never seen me or this
road. Too're carrying entirely too much
foliage, my overgrown friend, and I'll un

"Pardon me. gentlemen, ' interrupted a i
healthy looking young woman with red I
cheeks and laughing eyes. "I'm afraid
you misunderstand. There is a 'Moss
back' in Kalkaskt* County. I teach school
there: but it is back a ways from the rail
road line."
"Now do you get it through your head?"
snapped the big man.
"Yes; but I sell tickets on this road, not
dirt roads."

Certainly nobility is of blood and birth,

foolish old courtiers of Louis XIV, and
think that nobility consists- in "Le droit

forget that what is called blue blood is
often very bad blood. I know a family of

WILLIAM LOOKS
MORE SERIOUS
Kaiser Passes Danger of
Stoutness.
IS NOW UNUSUALLY ACTIVE
SECURES ART WORKS AT HERR
MENZEL'S SUGGESTION.
One of These Recalls the Peculiar
Experience Sculptor Magnus-
Ben Had With Prince
Bisarck.
Special Table to Thp Tall and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 189;), by James Gor
don Benrn.-ti.
BERLIN, Jan. 28.â For those who
have not seen the Kaiser of late it will
be interesting to : know how his Ma
jesty looks. . The writer had not seen
him for a couple of years and was
therefore in a position, to judge if there
is any change in his appearance.
First, the Emperor has grown to look
very much more serious than he did.
His features have developed, his nose
has strengthened and that upward
twist of his mustache gives him an air
of sovereignty. His Majesty a few
years ago threatened to become very
stout, but that danger seems passed.
He is now quite as stout as is good for
a man, but not more so. I remarked
to a German about his Majesty having
become thinner. His reply was that
the Palestine tour did not agree with
him, as it did with the Empress, who
came back in splendid health. The Em
peror does not stand extremes of heat
and cold so well. He suffered from
heat.
On Wednesday evening the first court
ball was given. Every one noticed the
activity of the Kaiser, who did not re
main still the whole evening. He wore
a full dress Hussar uniform. The Em
press was gowned in a blue damask
covered with jewels.
The latest addition to the coveted Or
der of the Black Eagle, Herr yon Men
zel, was there and constantly at the
elbow of the Kaiser. Herr yon Menzel
is now an intimate artistic adviser of
the Emperor, and it was he who at
Defilee de la Cour suggested the visit
to the studio of Otto Magnussen, the
sculptor. Much has been written about
that visit, which ended in the Kaiser
purchasing the great work of Frederick
the Great on his deathbed, and the
famous statue of Bismarck wearing his
big-brimmed hat.
After looking at the former work the
Kaiser said: "There is but one appro
priate place for that splendid inspira
tion. It is in the death chamber of
Frederick the Great at Sans Souci."
This shows that the Kaiser has ad
vanced in his appreciation of art, for
six years agu ho saw the same work
and passed it after making some re
mark ahout what a pity it was to chisel
Frederick the Great in his night shirt.
The famous Bismarck statue, which
the Kaiser also purchased, has its un
told history, showing that the project
of making it was nearly nipped in the
bud. It happened thus: After much
trouble and through the medium of Dr.
Schwenlnger, the former Chancellor
had been persuaded to give sittings.
Otto Magnussen, in haste, sent a post
card to a friend with whom he had an
engagement, expressing regret that he
could not come as Prince Bismarck had
given him an appointment at Fried
richsruhe. The genius is generally care
less, and then Magnussen forgot to ad
dress the card, but posted it. The post
officials in d<>ubt sent it to Friedriehs
ruhe. Bismarck was furious. He tele

thought proper to make public a private

SANTIAGO DB CUBA. Jan. 20.â For
the last month there have been big flres
on the hill tops, reminding Americans
here of the days when they used to
read in the naming papers of the burn
ing of sugar cane, tobacco, etc., by the
Insurgent forces. But the present fires
are kindled for the purpose of clearing
the land for farmers' use.
The smail planters are returning to
their work and their homes. Many of
them have since the Spanish surren
der been working for the Govern
ment either in the street cleaning de
partment or some similar branch *>f the
Government service, where they have
earned from $1 to $1 50 a day, and as
they have got living down to a fine art,
and in aJI probability their wives and
children ha c been drawing indigent
rations in quantity sufficient to keep
the entire family, most of the wages
have been saved by them. Hundreds
of Cubans who have been working for
the various Government departments
during the last filfe months have from
$100 to $150 saved.
This returning to work in the coun
try means the cultivation of land that
was never previously anything but
waste. It means vacancies in the san
tary and quartermaster's departments,
which will be given to other Cubans,
who, in the course of a few months,
will also have saved sufficient money
to take up an acre or two of land and
go into the country with their families.
A horseback trip through the coun
try, accompanied by a guide, from
.Santiago to San Luis, returning via
Songo, a journey of nearly fifty miles,
taking two days to perform, reveals
an extraordinary change in the situ
ation during the last few months. Three
months ago there were only a dozen or
so small agriculturists engaged in their
occupation throughout the entire dis
trict, while to-day there must be about
2000. Then one would see nothing but
waste lands, overgrown with weeds.
To-day acres upon acres of small hold
ings are carefully attended to and yield
ing luscious fruits and vegetables.
Some small capitalists possessing a
few hundred dollars and a few acres of
land are starting on a more ambitious
scale with the intention of establish
ing coffee plantations, but as it takes
three years for a coffee plantation to
begin to pay even running expenses, a
few acres adjoining are generally put
Into banana and other fruit trees.
Vegetables also are grown for the mar
ket. These more than pay the expenses
attendant upon the starting of a coffee
plantation.
The cost of living to the small agri
culturist is practically nil, for he
grows almost everything needed on his
own bit of land.

STREET.
The Wounded Man Is Suffering
From Concussion of the Brain
and Is Likely to
Die.
J-M.Soldanelh, alias "Fingers," a well
known race track habitue, was arrested
last evening by Officer McGrayn of the
Southern station and charged with bat
tery. It is expected that a more seri
ous charge will be placed against him
to-day.
About a week ago "Fingers," as he
is more familiarly known, assaulted W.
H. Brown, an assayer, with a "black
jack." Brown, after returning to his
home at 1116 Leavenworth street, be
came seriously ill and a physician was
sent for. An examination disclosed that
the unfortunate man was suffering
from concussion of the brain, the re
sult of the blow. Yesterday afternoon
H. W. Jendar, who was with Brown
when he was struck, visited police
headquarters and swore to a complaint
iigainst "Fingers," charging him with
battery. Policeman McGrayn, who was
given the warrant to serve, found
Brown's assailant at the Emeryville
race track. He willingly consented to
accompany the officer to this city.
"When formally charged at the City
Prison "Fingers" vigorously denied
that he used a "black jack" on Brown.
â¢ He claimed that he was accompanied
by two women on the night of the
trouble and as he passed Brown and a
â male companion the former made some
disparaging remarks about his female
consorts. Becoming exasperated he
struck Brown with his clenched fist,
knocking him down.
Brown, however, tells an entirely dif
ferent story.
He says that he and his friend Jen
dar were walking along O'Farrell street
and when near Powell he was struck
behind the ear by "Fingers." Not think
ing he was seriously injured by the
"blow he left the scone and walked down
Powell street. A short time afterward
he became dazed and was taken home
in a hac". by two of his friends.
Brown is satisfied that "Fingers"
struck him with some blunt instrument,
presumably a "black jack." He strenu
.ously denied that he passed any re
marks about the women who were with
his assailant and is at a loss to ex
plain why "Fingers" should have as
saulted hiijn. __- â  ,';

C. H. Raymond Fears He Will Be
Killed by C. E. Crandall.
C. H. Raymond, a decorator, latt night

Raymond owed him.
Crandall is also a decorator, and some

Annual Ball of the Schwaben Verein
Is Most Successful â Striking
Tableaux and Handsome
Costumes.
Turner Hall, on Turk street, was a
scene of gayety and color last evening.
The annual masquerade ball of the San
Francisco Bchwahen Verein crowded its
confines with revelers, who mad.- merry
until the wee sma' hours. There was
hardly a character known to man that
was not depicted. SonT> were charming,
some ludicrous, others fanciful and many
capricious. Fair maids and gallants trip
ped the fantastic and Cyranoes and
clowns floundered on the slippery floor.
No expense was spared by the society
in making the affair a memorable one.
The Interior of the hall was decorated in
pink and white, resplendent with silver
stars, and the cnsttiming and stage set
tings In the tableaux presented were gor
geous.
Emperor William's pilgrimage to the
Holy City whs the subject of the
tableaux. The first scone depicted th
land of the crescent. As the curtain arose
the Sultan was Been seated ox< a tbron*
by the seashore with his vassals around
him. In the distance was a German man- â¢
of-war. After a guard of honor had j
marched across the stage, an excellent !
counterfeit presentment of the German
Emperor and consort gracefully iloated
in in a small boat. A fitting welcome was
given him and the act closed with a song
from the participants. The next scene i
wa.s the interior of the Sutan's palace.
After the Emperor had been introduced to
all the dignitaries present he was enter
tained with a pretty dance by his brother
ruler's maids. The concluding tableaux
Kmperor William's arrival in
Jerusalem. Toasts and speeches were de
livered in German and the curtain was
rung down amid the singing of a ballad.
The grand march followed and it was a
pleasing picture to the large crowd of
spectators in the gallery. A vari-col
ored limelight heightened the effect of
the costumes, and although no prizes
were offered the criticisms were free and
many. . ,
Among the queer sights witnessed was
p half-dozen ladies and gentlemen parad
ing around the hall attired in their robes
de nult and holding lighted candles in
their hands. They were looking for their
better halves and their search was re
tarded by the revelers extinguishing their

THE SA3 FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. JANUARY 23, 1809.
GEORGE E. WHITE
FILES A PETITION
IN INSOLVENCY
Cattle King Says He
Is Bankrupt..
LIABILITIES ARE $200,000
ASKS TO BE ALLOWED TO KEEP
HIS HOMESTEAD.
Latest Chapter in the Sensational
Career of the Lord of Round Val
ley â Troubles Date From
Wife's Divorce.
George E. White, the uncrowned kine
of Mendocino County, has surrendered
his sovereignty and asked the court to
divide the vast domain over which he
has so long ruled with a rod of iron
among his creditors. In a petition in
insolvency filed in the United States
District Court yesterday morning, the
man whose will has for years been
practically the only law recognized by
the half-wild vaqueros of the Round
Valley district, voluntarily abdicates
his authority, confesses his utter ina
bility to pay his debts and pleads for
the law he has so often defied in the
past to come to his rescue and set apart
a remnant of his former great posses
sions for his support in his old age.
According to the statement of lia
bilities and assets appended to the peti
tion, the one-time cattle kine owes
claims having a face value of $181,153.
but which, together with accrued inter
est, etc.. will aggregate over $200,000.
The value of the assets as given in the
statement is $110,000, including all the
real estate, which is mortgaged for
$109,000. The largest single claim is
that of the Sun Insurance Company,
which holds an unsatisfied mortgage
for JSS.OOO. The amount due this con
cern was originally $70,000. but unpaid
interest piled up until a judgment was
recently secured for a total of $92,368.
On January of this year the Supreme
Court, on appeal, cut this amount down
to $88,000. Of the other claims men
tioned in the schedule the only ones of
more than a few thousand dollars are
those of White's divorced wife for $40.
--000 and a mortgage for $28,000 held by
Costigan & Cohen of this city. It is for
the acknowledged nurpose of ridding
himself of these annoying debts that
the lord of Round Valley seeks to be
legally declared a bankrupt. He de
clares he has been harassed and pur
sued by his creditors, meaning his ex
wifp, until he has been driven almost
to distraction, and now professes his
willingness to throw all his immense
holdings into th<- ring and let those
having claims against him fight for the
spoils. All he asks for himself is his
homestead In Mendocino County. con
sisting pf l<so acres, and valued at $5000,
together with about $1000 worth <>f oer
boobJ property, which hf claims the law
allows him. Those who know White
besl are inclined to suspect some
scheme to defeat the law. They inti
mate that it will be found that White
has made away with the most valuable
portion of his holdings, and that his
petition in insolvency is only a blind.
His record suggests such a course, and
he may find obstacles in the way of
securing a discharge from his Indebt
edness at the hands of the court. A
similar petition was filed by White in
the Superior Court of Mendocino Coun
ty last summer, but was successfully
fought by his ex-wife's attorneys.
Whether they will attempt to interfere
in the present proceedings remains to
bÂ« seen.
George E. White's troubles, financial
and otherwise, date from the inaugura
tion of divorce proceedings by Mrs.
Frankie White in 1883. At that time
he was rated a millionaire and wielded
a tremendous influence in the Round
Valley district, where he owned Im
mense herds of cattle. In addition to
great tracts of land in Mendocino,
Trinity and Humboldt counties in the
north he also held the title to other
vast tracts in Kings, Kern and Tulare
counties, altogether more than 40,000
acres. Notwithstanding this great em
nlre held in his own light, he invaded
th Government reservations and fat
tened his cattle for the market on fod
der grown on the preserves of Uncle
Sam, in defiance of the Federal authori
ties. This man apparently knew no
law but his own sweet will, and fought
with tigerish ferocity every attempt to
curtail the authority he had usurped.
In Round Valley he was feared and
avoided by the law abiding element
and won his title of Cattle King as
m*uch by the terror he inspired as by
the immensity of his herds.
When his wife instituted her suit for
divorce every man who expressed him
self as favoring her cause took his life
in his hands. Those who went on the
witness stand and testified in her be
half were given up as lost by their
friends and events proved that their
fears were well founded. Murders, more
or less mysterious, began to occur with
alarming frequency, and In almost
every instance the victims were men
who had taken sides against the Cattle
King. White was not charged with
taking an active part in the assasslna
tions, but he had a horde of cowboys
in his employ always ready to do his
bidding, and whether rightly or wrong
ly, the community felt that he was met
ing out vengeance to his enemies for
daring to openly defy his wishes and
take the part of the wife who had re
pudiated him. But although he fought
the divorce and the accompanying peti
tion for a division of the property with
all the immense power at his command,
both in court and out, he was defeated.
Mrs. White was given a decree and
finally awarded $100,000 alimony. Then
followed a long series of legal contests,
by which Mrs. White sought to compel
the payment of the award and the Cat
tle King tried to prevent her receiving
any benefit from the court's decree.
Finally one of White's ranches was
levied on and sold to satisfy the judg
ment, and at the sale of the property
it was bid in by the woman for $70,000.
This is all she ever realized. With thÂ«
accrued interest, the amount still dvÂ«
now foots up to over $40,000. As a last
resort to avoid paying this and other
claims against him the Cattle King of
Mendocino County, the man whose
minions held the entire community in
a state bordering closely upon terror
for year? by their reckless disregard for
all law, comes into court as a suppliant
and asks that he be declared a bank
rupt. His great herds of cattle ar*
gone, his almost limitless domain of
land is plastered with mortgages for
nearly their full value, and with the
disappearance of his wealth his poweÂ»>
and claim to the title of "king" have
vanished. He no longer dictates to his
neighbor, but pleads with the court that
h? be left a small slice of hfs great
estate in order that he may still hayÂ«
a home. Since Mrs. White secured he*
divorce White has married again.

able, the affliction is more marked when
he IB excited, for then he finds the great
est difficulty in talking, the excitement
seeming to act as a hindrance to his
speech.
One day last week he was engaged in
conversation with a friend who made a
certain assertion, the truth of which was
denied by the other. They engaged in a
wordy war, and the dispute waxed hot,
which had the effect of causing the stut
tering one to stammer considerably. At
last the latter offered to bet $10 that he
was correct on the proposition, but he
was much chagrined to find that he
did not have the ready cash.
However, he happened to espy another
friend near by and to him he determined
to apply for" the loan. He approached
him. but by that time he had become so
much excited over his argument with his
other friend that speech became difficult
to him and he spoke something after this

WINEMAKERS
TO COMBINE
ON NEW BASIS
California Concern to
Reorganize.
CONVENTION IN THIS CITY
PRESIDENT HENRY CROCKER
ISSUES AN ADDRESS.
Says Viticultural Prospects Are Ex
cellent â Urges Co-operation of
90 Per Cent of the Inter
ests Involved.
The period of five years for which the
California "Wine-makers Corporation was
organized will expire with the present
year's vintage, and President Henry J.
Crocker is now arranging preliminaries
looking to the reorganization of the con
cern upon a sounder and more harmonious
basis. His suggestion is that a conven
tion be held in this city at which plans
may be perfected for a solid and lasting
organization of the wine interests. He
has Issued an address on the subject
which will be forwarded to every wine
maker and grower in California.
Copies of the address will also be sent
to the banks of England, which have re
quested exhaustive information about
California's wine industry. This tends to
show that foreign capital is desirous of
interesting itself in one of the most pro
ductive resources of the State.
The California Wine-makers' Corpora
tion was never in better condition than
It is at the present time," said President
Crocker. "The lawsuits brought against
it have all been settled, one in particu
lar in which judgment was obtained by
the California Wine Association for $130,
--000, and appealed by us to the Supreme
Court, having been compromised for
$8000. I am happy to say that the deal
ers have come together and have recog
nized the importance of co-operating with
the growers, and they have united to pro
mote harmony. The corporation has been
strengthened by the addition of Lack
mann & Jacobi, who will purchase wine
from it.
"The prospects from a vltieultural
standpoint are excellent. The vines
which were made sick by last year's
drought have been put in splendid shape
for next year's crop."
In his address Mr. Crocker says the
vineyard interests form one of the great
est natural resources of California, and
have upward of $100,000,000 capital invest
ed. While the wine industry never looked
better at present, the outlook for the fu
ture is not so reassuring. The principal
difficulties with which the management of
the corporation has had to contend have
arisen from the discontent and lack of
co-operation on the part of the members
themselves. Many of them not under
standing business methods necessary to
achieve success, have grown restless un
der delayed payments which the tight for
the markets rendered necessary, and the
corporation management has had to con
tend with not only its natural enemies,
but its own members.
The example of the raisin growers, who
have formed an association of 2000 mem
bers. Is cited as a good one to follow.
By their organization the price of raisins
in the sweat boxes went from I*4 to over
3 cents a pound, and the value of the
year's product increased approximately
$1 400 000. The secret of their success lies
m their unanimity and harmqny of ac
tion. The prune growers of the State
have recently come together and no doubt
they will accomplish similar results if
they pursue the same tactics as the raisin
Those most familiar with the subject
say the winemakers should reorganize
next year on a new and better basis, tak
ing knowledge and wisdom from the mis
takes of the past. They should follow the
example of the raisin growers, who have
98 per cent of their total number en
rolled in one corporate body. There can
be no hope for permanent prosperity in
the wine business unless this is done. The
grape grower and winemaker. under a 90
per cent co-operation, could control the
situation to such an extent as to estab
lish a steady price for grapes and wines.
At least $10 a ton would be the ruling
price of grapes, and the certificates of
the corporation would pass as current as
a gold note among the bankers. The price
of wine would be in proportion and placed
at a figure that would give the wine
maker a good profit on his investment.
The dealer would recognize a steady and
sure profit instead of the speculative na
ture which had ' before surrounded the
wine business. If the grape growers and
winemakers will band themselves to the
extent of 90 per cent of the interests in
volved Mr. Crocker will reorganize the
corporation on such a sound basis that
It will exist for years to come.
The plan of reorganization should have
its inception in the different wine dis
tricts, where meetings could be called and
initial organization be made that would
send delegates to a convention in San
Francisco to form a more lasting organi
zation. The dire effects of failure to organ

ZACHARINI IN HARD LUCK.
Loses a Sack Containing Nearly
Five Hundred Dollars.
M. Zacharini. a recent arrival from the
East, mourns the loss of $475, which he
lost in a saloon at 7 Stockton street yes
terday afternoon.
Zacharini had the money in a sack, and
after having a drink he went to an out
house in the rear of the saloon. He took
the sark containing the money out of his
pocket and placed it on the floor. On
leaving the place he forgot about his
money and when he returned a short time
afterward he was surprised to find the
money gone. He at once notified the po
lice, but up to a late hour last night no
trace of the missing coin was found.
Methodist Revival Service.
The Methodist churches of the city have
united on a great revival service to con
tinue through the months of January and
February. The pastors take turns in
preaching, and meetings are held simul
taneously in three churches for a period
of two weeks. The meetings last week
were held in Simpson Memorial. Epworth
and First churches. The audiences* have
been large and intensely interested. Scores
of people have already signified their
purpose to become active Christians. The
sermons last week were delivered by
Revs-:. Dr. J. N. Beard. Charles Edward
Locke. John A. B. Wilson, Frederick C,
Lee, T. H. Woodward, George Baugh, S.
M. Woodward and W. D. Crabb. A spe
cial feature of the meetings is the excel
lent singing. A new book is being used.
Cordial invitations are extended to the
public to attend these meetings.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with

FATE OF CORDELIA BOTKIN
HANGS IN THE BALANCE
The Matter of the Court's Juris
diction Has Been Argued
and Submitted.
90 TF section 27 of the Penal Code â 
O o I âpresumably the only barrier <Â«
â¦ â¦ I that stands between the con- C
o o x demned murderess. Cordelia <|
â f-f Botkin, and libertyâ had nerves ?
it would quit its job. No statutory sj
enactment that ever crept be- &
tween the leaves of a work of law o
has been the subject of more <g
wrangling and the genius of the V
city is at variance as to its in- A
tent, its meaning, its effect and %
its legality. Mrs. Botkin, 'whose $
crime has no precedent, and Dis- v&
trlct Attorney Murphy thanks God X
that it is bo, was up again before <Q>
Judge Cook yesterday, but the <Â«
center of attack and censure was V
directed, not at the criminal, who 33
sat smiling at her counsel, but at <Â£
puzzling section 27, and the end is Â§
not yet. Yesterday's meeting in w
Judge Cook's court was occasioned '<$>'
by a desire on the part of defend- Â§
ant's counsel to argue the matter $
of Jurisdiction. Judge Angellotti #
of Marin occupied the bench with
Judge Cook and next Saturday v&
they will decide whether or not <Â§>
the woman whom twelve men with 6
naught but Justice in mind ' have <Â§>
determined should pass her re- *?
maining days in prison for an ap- ft
palling crime shall suffer for her <Â§>
sins or walk from the court room &
free, amenable to no law yet Â®
framed. Â£
Mrs.- Botkin was represented by '. Â£>
george A. Knight and Frank Me- "
Go wan, while District Attorney X
Murphy and John A. Hosmer, who *r
prosecuted the prisoner, and Chief X
Lees represented the forces of the X
"- State. i -, 'ro l
Mr. Knight first took the floor, X
and after remarking that as the A
court had an associate he would,<Â£
â¢ go more fully into the details of the o
crime charged, proceeded to give <â¢>
a history of the case from the Â£>
sending of the poisoned candy to <Â£
the death of its partakers, a duty O
which District Attorney Murphy x
also performed when his time for V
argument came. Concluding the x
history of the case Knight V
launched out into the matter of A
jurisdiction. When the matter of *r
extradition was argued Knight *
and associate counsel contended V;
that the State of Delaware had A
nothing to do with the case at bar X
and admitted that the case could A
be tried in this State. : v\ <Â§>
The District Attorney contend- 6
ed that the prisoner could not be <X
tried in this State, but urged her o
extradition. The status of the case <Â»
is now reversed, Knight holding &
that the courts of this State have <Â«>
no Jurisdiction, the District Attor- Â£*
ney contending that they have, Â£>
Knight won in the first instance V
and it is the consensus of opinion X
that he will win in the matter of V
jurisdiction. The law is peculiar Â£
and Knight proceeded to take ad- V
. vantage of its peculiarities. X
Knight, when he entered into his 3*
peroration on jurisdiction,, took an w
opening shot at the District At- **
torney. â¢â â ?;.;- ... Â®

I pie would not have dared to sug- m
\ grest that this court had jurisdic- â 
i tion," he Bald, "had there been Â£
; no popular clamor, no outcry. But "
\ the people raised their hands in sf>
> horror at the thought that this w
woman should escape, and the I
District Attorney demanded the ,Â«
trial of this woman whom he X
knows, even though she admitted !<j
the crime charged, is not amena- i
ble to the laws of California." i
Knight, then . addressed the \
court and asked if a man should o
purchase a gun In this State and %
go to Nevada and then murder v
the State executive, could he be h
tried under section 27 of the Penal 9
Code, which provides that "a per- Â«
. son is punishable in this State for y
â¢ any crime committed in whole" or 2
in part In this State?" This is the *
only law the District Attorney can '4
find to authorize him to try the ac- %
cused. and he has clutched at it <
to appease. the clamor of the nor- %
rifled public." Mr. Knight then be- i
gan the citation of authorities. *
The case of Stewart vs. Jessup,' '<
reported in the nineteenth volume X
of the American Reports, was <
cited. Stewart was arrested and <
confined in Pennsylvania for ob- Â£
taining property (a carload of <;
horses) in New York under false -C
pretenses. The Pennsylvania '<
court released the prisoner, how- $
ever, holding that 4 Stewart could <2
not be punished in one State for a 'â *
crime completed in another. In 5
its opinion in this case the court â *
said that "it may be assumed, as 4
a general proposition, that the i
criminal laws of a State do not <
bind and cannot affect those out I
of the territorial limits of the <
State." .-; ". â  . ; i-'.-;v" :;j
If it is the law that the crimi- <
nal laws of one State cannot bind J
those out of its territorial limits, '<
then this prisoner should go free* Â£
he said, for the authorities of ages i
agree that in \ the crime of mur- \
der the crime is completed where $
the blow was struck, and the blow )
in this case was struck in Dela- o
ware, not in California. Citation *
followed citation, but that most 3
directly bearing on the case was '
taken from "Horton on Criminal 3
Law, which holds that "where ?
poison administered in one juris- 5
diction operates in another the lat- 2
ter jurisdiction is- that of the 2
trial." Other citations proved that Â«
it- has long been held that where Â£
injury was inflicted In one coun- 2
ty and had its effect in another *
the latter was the proper place for ?.
trial, as is the case when a mur- ij
der is committed across the boun- Â«
dary line of a State and when lot- c
tery tickets are mailed' from one '4
country to the other. A quotation $,
from an Ohio case } which reads, .3
"The overt act of poisoning is not X
merely the prescription and fur- $
nishing the same, but its conse- \
quences. So. where poison is pre- a
scribed and furnished In one coun- *
ty and the victim takes it In an- 0
other, and there dies, the latter j
county is the place where the i
crime is consummated and the iur- 2
Isdiction for trial rests", Knight "y
fortified his position well with '2
such citations and then said: ; "If v

Is Discussed.

MENTS IN SERVICE.

Reception.
The exclusive announcement in The
Call to the effect that Colonel William K.
Smedberg is the possible winner of the
adjutant generalship was the talk in Na
tion Guard circles yesterday, and it came
in the nature of a surprise, for the colonel,
while mentioned in some quarters as a
possibility, was not Uooked upon as the
coming man. There aÂ»re some of the wlsa
men of the guard wbjo believe that the*'
can see through the nolitical wall as far
as the next nuin, and they say that the
next adjutant general, as well aa the as
sistant general und the clerk in the of
fire. will all be men from the southern
part of the State. The clerk who is there
iiuw is trum the south, and was at onÂ«
time in the office of Governor Gage.
The Sixth and the Seventh regiments of
infantry are now again a part of the Na
tional Guard, and it is stated that the
majority of the men, who as volunteers
did guard duty for so many months and
were disappointed at not being sent to
Manila, have resumed their positions in
the several companies from which they
volunteered.
Lieutenant Colonel A. B. C. Dohrmann,
inspector on the staff of the division com
mander, has applied for a leave of absence
for six months wfth permission to leave
the State and the Lnited States.
The bill introduced for the reorganiza
tion of the guard reduces the staff of the
commander-ln-chief one-half, and is not
so top-heavy as it is at present. The
numerical force is twelve instead of twen
ty-four, and there are not so many col
onels as at present. Those composing the
staff are the adjutant general with the
rank of brigadier, adjutant general with,
the rank of colonel, ten aides-de-camp,
four to be named by the Governor and six
to be selected from the officers of the
military and naval branches of ihe guard.
On the staff of the major general there
will be an assistant adjutant general, with,
the rank of colonel; surgeon, with the
rank of colonel, to be the head of the
Sanitary' Corps; inspector, with rank of
colonel, to be inspector general; engineer,
with rank of colonel, to be engineer in
chief; quartermaster, with rank of lieu
tenant colonel, to be quartermaster gen
eral; paymaster, lieutenant colonel, to be
paymaster general; commisary of sub
sistence, lieutenant colonel, to be com
missary general; judge advocate, lieuten
ant colonel, to be judge advocate general;
two inspectors of small arms and ord
nance, one chief signal officer, two order
lies with the rank of major; the senior
aid may be assistant adjutant general,
and two non-commissioned officers with
the grade of sergeant major and the uni
form of such in the cavalry.
The change on the staff of the brigadier
generals gives three lieutenant colonels,
six majors and two aids with the rank of
captain. The new bill provides that offi
cers of the Naval Militia must be selected
from those who have served in the United
States navy, in the volunteer navy, the
auxiliary navy (that is, those who Berved
in the late war), or the United States rev
enue marine service. The idea of thia
is to give those who served during the
late war in the auxiliary navy an oppor
tunity to be promoted.
A secret in connection with tfte Naval
Militia of this State has just come out,
and that is that there was an order from
the Naval Department that the entire
Naval Militia was to be ordered to Mare
Island to be placed on the Independence
or other suitable vessels there and mus
tered into the service as were the men of
the military branch; but for some reason
the orders of the Navy Department were
never carried out, and instead of having
nearly 500 men in the auxiliary navy the
State of California was represented by
only about eighty men. Now the naval
branch of the guard is anxious to know
Who smothered the order.
Roscoe Howard, who served In the
auxiliary navy, has been elected to the
command of the third division of the
militia at San Diego, vice Chandler.
Under a decision of the Navy Depart
ment officers of the engineer corps are
classed as line officers and entitled to all
the privileges of such.
Lieutenant Junior Grade A. A. Morgan,
navigation officer of the Pinta, has ten
dered his resignation.
In the preparing of the bill that has
been introduced at Sacramento the naval
militia is placed on exactly the same lines
as the United States navy, so far as it
can be done without coming in conflict
with the laws of the State. There is *
provision that the ordnance officer and
the signal officers shall not be assigned
to any other duty. It also provides that
a marine band may be maintained and a
chaplain appointed.
At present the several companies are al
lowed a fixed amount to pay armory rent,
but the new bill proposes to take this
away from the companies and allow
armory Tent to be paid from headquarters
at Sacramento. This is raising a wave
of dissatisfaction in the several com
panies, and there are many who will urge
that the State, own its own armories in
the large cities, where the troops could be
concentrated.
The reception given to Corporal William
J. Stock of the Signal Corps of the Sec
ond Brigade, recently returned from serv
ice at Manila, and the farewell to J. W.
Hobbs, adjutant of the Veteran Signal
Corps, was attended by about thirty-five
of that corps, and a very pleasant even
ing was spent. The company listened
with interest to the recital of the man
from the front and then there was an
evening of music and song, congratula
tions to the returned and the wishing of
godspeed to the departing guest.

Board of Trustees, held at the Town Hall
last night.
The controversy dates back several
yeara ago to the time when the Southern
Pacific Railway Company laid its spur
track to the West Berkeley local line in
order to facilitate transportation for the
factories at the west end. The track was
laid across the property of the Heywood
Lumber Company, with only a provisional
right of way, subject to withdrawal at
any time by the owners of the Heywood
property. The owners of the property
have announced their intention on Beveral
occasions lately of having the track re
moved, and have even threatened to un
dertake the removal themselves if their
request were not complied with.
The only other thoroughfare to which
tho railroad could look was the portion of
Becond street between Rose ano Holyoke
streets. They accordingly petitioned the
Board of Trustees for a franchise along
Second street for that distance. To this
the residents in that portion of the city
strenuously objected, and through the in
fluence of their representations and peti
tions the board refused the franchise. The
position of the factory owners was at
lirst neutral, but the prospect of being
without any railroad connection at all
threw their influence on the side of
pr.-iuting the franchise. Petition and
counter-petition accordingly poured in
upon the Board of Trustees, who with
held action until last night. On the un
derstanding that the track crossing the
Heyweod property would be taken up
within a short time the board finally set
tled the matter by granting the franchise.
HORRIBLE HALLUCINATION.
John Wilson Says Gophers Enter His
Stomach and Rob Him of
Nourishment.
OAKLAND. Jan. 28.â John Wilson, re
siding with his aged mother on East Six
teenth street, was examined for insanity
by Dr.Â«. Milton and Burchard to-day and
"â¢'immitted to the Napa Asylum by Judge
Ellsworth.
Wilson's case is a peculiarly sad one.
He is nearly 80 yeari of age and has been
an unbearable burden to his aged mother
for the last two years. The unfortunate
i man imagines that each time he partakes
! of food gophers enter his stomach and
rob him of all nourishment; that these
gophers come as spirits which infest his
home. On account of this strange hal
lucination, and in the hope that a change
of residence might Hnallv rid her son of
these horrible thoughts, Mrs. Wilson has
moved about to different parts of Oak
land nt least fifteen times during the past
year, but all to no avail. She gave up all
hope yesterday and it was at her request
that the son was examine.].

OAKLAND, Jan. 2X.-\VhUe engaged in
applying a layer of tar to tho roof of the
Hall of Records yesterday N. O. Winters

painful experience. He and a. Rial were

Winters' act almost immediately after

PLAY NOTHING NOW
BUT INNOCENT KENO
PERIODICAL CLEANUP OF GAM
BUNG DENS.
Police Declare That There Is Not a
Forbidden Game in the
City.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 28.
The periodical war gainst gambling and
nlckel-in-the-slot machines has broken
out again and police officers are busy
raiding crap games, inspecting gambling
establishments and appropriating nickel â¢
in-the-slot machines which are not run
legally.
Five well-known saloon keepers were
arrested last night with their machines.
This morning, in the police court, they
each forfeited $20 bail rather than be
bothered with a trial, and were allowed
to depart with thetr machines. The law
permits the machine to be run with
checks, but not with nickels, and in fu
ture checks will be used.
The recent decision of the local court
that keno is not a game prohibited by
law has somewhat relieved the situation.
In all parts of town keno is being openly
played, and has taken the place of craps,
faro and other forbidden games.
Chief Fletcher now positively declares :
that there Is not a forbidden game run
ning in town and that Chinese lotteries
have been absolutely driven out. In
scores of saloons nickel-in-the-slot ma
<-nines and keno engage the attention of
large crowds and apparently there is
more gambling than ever before, because;
it is not considered any longer necessary
to play under cover. But everybody is
certain that nothing but keno is being
played,
scores of saloons nickel-in-the-slot ma-
PICKING BRIDGE FLAWS.
C. E. Kinard, Nemesis of Constables
and Justices, on a New Tack.
OAKLAND, Jan. 28.â C. E. Kinard, who
has proved a Nemesis to Constables and
Justices of the Peace, is now on a new
tack. Ho claims to have discovered ir
regularities In the contract and work of
Cotton Bros, on the reconstructed Alice
street bridge, which he will submit to tho
Grand Jury. Kinard has been going over
the plans and specifications carefully, se
curing data upon which to base his
charges. He says, for instance, that
lighter nails or spikes were used than the
specifications called for, and where five
stringers were ordered but two were
placed, and that in work calling for bolts
pimple spikes were used. He also as
serts that the last payment was made by
the Supervisors on January 3. when the
reconstructed bridge was accepted on De
cember 12 last, and the law requires that
thirty-five days elapse between the time
of acceptance and last payment.
Kinard is carrying on a similar crusade
on the construction of the new Webster
street bridge.

LIBERTINE IS
STILL IN STAKE
WINNING FORM
Won the Follansbee
by a Nose.
HORATIO FINISHED SECOND
SAM McKEEVER NOSED OUT BY
SURVIVOR.
A Day of Extremely Close Finishes
at Oakland â Hohenzollern Beat
Torsida â O'Connell Only
Winning Favorite.
The finishes at Oakland yesterday were
close and exciting enough to have
unstrung the nerves of the cold
and clammy Napoleon if that great
ruler were still an inhabitant of
this earthly sphere. On four different
occasions did the winner get the verdict
by a nose, and great beads of perspira
tion as large as the three gilded balls in
front of a pawnbroker's establishment
stood out on the brow of many a specu
lator. It was also a day of disaster for
the talent, for many a well-meant one
finished back in the ruck and dust. As
the curtain was about to' drop old O'Con
nell won at odds of 1 to 2â the solitary
choice to score.
The result of the Follansbee handicap
valued at $1250, at seven furlongsâ was one
of the many surprises. Seven faced the
issue, with "Skeets" Martin's mount,
Maud Ferguson, favorite in the betting.
The filly opened at 8 to â¢Â§, to 3
to 1. She showed no speed whatever,
greatly perplexing th^ stable as well as
the public. Libertine, assigned 119
pounds and ridden by Henry Shields,
caught Horatio a few yards from the wire
and in a desperate drive won by a nose.
Gauntlet, the Burns & Waterhouse entry,
and plainly the best, was third. The
winner, at one time as good as 15 to 1,
closed at fi. Mary Black, carrying top
weight, 119 pounds, was never a con
tender.
Perhaps tho saddest hlow of all was the
defeat of San McKeover by Survivor.
Previous to this event, the fifth, the for
mer colt changed hands, running in the
colors of Fred Foster. A terrific plunge
was made on him. the Montana bred
youngster closing at 7 to 10 in the ring.
The start was one of Ferguson'H worst
efforts. Cash Sloan had the mount on
the good thing, and when the barrier was
released, not thinking it a go, started to
pull up. The recall flag was not brougnt
into requisition, and McKeevrr got much
the worst of it. Senora Caesar was loft
altogether. Miss Marion then led Sur
vivor for six furlongs, when Martin, on
the latter, took command, and in a fierce
drive breasted the tape a nose in front of
the favorite in I:4OV*.
Still another very expensive piece of
guessing for the crowd was tho downfall
of Torsida. "Daggie" Smith's good mare
was heavily backed to beat Honenzollern
in the mile purse run, and failed. Spen
cer, on the Elmwood Farm entry, took
matters very coolly, just getting up in
time to beat Torsida over the line by a
nose in 1:40 flat.
The talent received a solar plexis at the
very outset. Eleven good, bad and in
Â«!!(?Â»' rent sprinters lined up in a five fur
long scramble, with Roariwarmer nnd
Rey. Hooker the mostly backed. After a

Track Notes.
Garnet Ferguson was greatly disap
pointed over the showing made by his
filly, Maud Ferguson. He said after the
race he knows she can beat Sam Mc-
Keever. and was at a loss to account for
her run.
The Australian plunger and bookmaker,
Hill, was reported to have bet $5000 on
Sam McKeever. It was a hard wager to
lose. . . __
Sam McKeever ran In the colors, of Fred
Foster yesterday. Previous to his race
Garnet Ferguson was offered and accept

OAKLAND NAVY RACES.
San Antonio Estuary Will Be Dotted
With White-Winged Craft.
To the ordinary spectator, unskilled in
the calculation of sail area, load water
line and time allowance, a yacht race has
hitherto been an almost unintelligible af
fair. It is the only contest of speed in
which the first past the winning post,
though guilty of no fouling or other im
propriety, may be adjudged absolutely
last in the race. Then the elaborate divi
sion into classes according to sailing
length and rig breeds confusion in the
spectator's mind, which confusion is still
fur.ther augmented by the fact that
yachts appear to start when they please,
and not at a given signal, as is usual in
all other sports.
With a view to rendering yacht racing
more interesting and generally intelligi
ble the Oakland Navy adopts what is
known as the "one-gun start ; that is,
all boats start at the signal, and the first
to cross the starting line gains the advan
tage. The first to cross the winning line
is declared the winner, the times of all
the boats being taken from the signal
gun, without regard to the time at which
the boat may actually have crossed the
starting line. To-day is the hrst or a
series of such races to be held every
month during the present year. At 12:55
p. m. an American flag will be hoisted as
a preparatory signal on the piazza of the
house of the Alameda Boat Club on San
AntÂ«nlo Estuary. At Ip. m. the stars and
stripes will be hauled down, a red flag
displayed, and the starting gun fired.
After all the boats have crossed the start
ing line the red flag will be hauled down
and the national emblem run up. A white
flag will denote the postponement or
abandonment of the race.
The course will be between six and
seven miles in length and triangular in
Bh*pe. Craft of any rig, build, size,
measurement, length or sail area may en
ter, and will be divided into two classesâ
the red and the whiteâ according to
"mean length." The red class will include
all boats having a "mean length" cf
eighteen feet or IpjÂ»s, and the white class
will comprise all others. "Mean length"
is half the length over all anil on the
water line.
Th'^ committoempn in whose charge the
races will bo are Vice Commodore H. C.
Hinckley, Charles Stewart, Jules Hart
man. P. W. Hurndall and C. L. Taylor
Jr. Jules Hartman is measurer and R. R.

that will take part in the rac?s are the

there should have been mixed foursomes,
but though four ladies and several gen
tlemen were on the links, the contest did
not take place. Miss Eleanor Morrow of
San Rafael went round the course in 83
and Miss T. C. Morgan in 81. Miss Smed
berg and Miss Genevieve Carolan were
out, but made no returns.
William Thomas has returned from the
East, and yesterday went twice round the
links, making, the lirst nine holes in 53
and the second nine in 46. C. F. Mullins

POLITICIANS
ARE TRAVELING
A ROUGH ROAD
Minority Members of the Board
of Education Will Demand
Impartiality in the Dis
missal of Teachers.
A Majority of the Directors Favor a Be
consideration of the Abolition of the
Commercial Departments of the
Mission High School.
Everything is now in practical readiness
for the meeting of the Board of Educa
tion which will- be held to-morrow niprht.
This session will have at least the merit
of removing the anxiety that rules
throughout the School Department. Those
teachers who are under the ban will know
the fact beyond question and those that
are not will be relieved from doubt. No
full list of the teachers to be dismissed
has yet been published and none
will bo until Tuesrluy morning. Su
perintendent "Webster has almost
finished his report. and when it
is completed the members of the School
Board intend to scan It very olose
ly and critically, as the Superintendent
has already given good ground for the
suspicion that he leans rather heavily on
occasions upon jokers.
The minority members of the board are
determined that the majority shall be
scrupulously fair in carrying out the or
ders of dismissal and consolidation which
have already been made. Every effort Is
being made by politicians of both par
ties to save favorites at the expense of
teachers who under the general orders of
the board should not be dismissed. At
tempts are being made to juggle some
teachers out and keep others in, but the
minority believes that for decency's sake
at Last the work of reform should be
honestly done.
The records of the Board of Education
â will be the proof of the justice or the in
justice of the action of the directors.
Every teacher in the department, day,
night, regular and special instructor,
knows the date of his or her appointment.
Each has the absolute right to know
under the ruling of the board itself th-it
every teacher appointed after her must be
dismissed before she is disturbed. IC this
is not done the board will stultif- itself
and justify the assertion that politics and
not reform animates its actions. The
last leaehfrs appointed must b\ under
the ruling of the board, the first to go
A serious complication has already
presented itself in reference to this ruling
The records show that in some cases as
â¢n Â£ aS twenty teachers were appointed
on the same da >L by the last board The
way will n be -without difficulty if. for ex
ample, all of the twenty are to be con
Â«?L 1U tn tC out. but if only some of than
finn winÂ°, dsmls |f d a question of <I<scre
tlon will arise. Every one of the tweii'v
teachers will v have the right to lav that
she shall be the last to go It
has been suggested that in such
cases as these lots be drawn by
the teachers to decide who shall
go Whatever policy is adopted the
matter will not be left to the discretion of
fcut.erintendent Webster jr
â Â°hin^l l nesda V night the board adopted
a blanket resolution providing that all
teachers appointed to the department on
a. nd after August 1 - 189S, shall be summar-
Ilj dismissed. This resolution has a much
deeper significance than was at first sup
posed. It was intended to strike, not
only at substitute and probationary
teachers appointed since August 1, but at
teachers who were transferred from the
evening to the day schools since that
elate. In one instance a teacher who had
been several years in the night schools
was transferred to the day class. Her ap
pointment to the department will date
from .her entrance into the day school.
All her service in the night school will
count for nothing. In this way certain
teachers recently appointed to the depart
ment will be saved at the expense of oth
ers, who have been longer in the service.
Since the work of consolidation has be
gun it has been suggested that the mar
ried teachers in the department be asked
to give up their places before their un
married rivals. It is argued that the mar
ried teachers have husbands to support
them and can with better grace retire be
fore those who must support them
selves. There is a standing rule of
the Board of Education covering
this subject, but it has not been
enforced. The new board has the power
to make it operative now and may
do so. If married teachers are retired
many of the recent appointees to the de
partment will be saved from dismissal.
An agitation is also being raised to save
the department of sewing from destruc
tion. This department. It is claimed, has
done a vast amount of good in the poorer
districts in teaching the children of poor

" TETTER ON HANDS CURED
I had been troubled with tetter for several
years. At times my hands would be sore all
over, so that I could not use them at all, and
were so tender that clear water, even, smarted
like tire, and it spread over arms, neck and
face. I had been treated by physicians, but
without benefit, when I began the CUTICURA
remedies. I found relief before I had taken
the first bottle. I used three or four bottles of
CUTICURA RESOLVENT, one cake of CUTI-
CURA SOAP and one box of CUTICURA (oint-
ment), and It has never troubled me since.

people the elements of plain sewing. Girls
are taught to make their own garments
and this is a matter of very great con
cern to people of poor or limited means.
Every effort will be made by the poorer
classes, ther. fore, to induce the board to
retain the department of, sewing. The
matter is now under consideration and
will he decided next Monday night by the
board.
However commendable the motives of
the Board of Education in seeking to
overcome the financial difficulties of the
SchooJ Department, it is evident that the
closing of the commercial classes of the
Mission High School has raised a storm
of protests. The Mission i$ a large and
prominent division of this city, and every
single man. woman and scholar inhabit
ing that territory is working to retain the
abolished portion of the High School.
Each member of the board has been peti
tioned to reconsider the matter until the
Directors have come to believe that the
question was of greater dimensions than
it appeared to be at first sight. Superin
tendent Webster proposed the measure,
and the Directors voted on his recom
mendation, so they say. without going
far into the matter. However, the board
is assailed by protests which will be
heard.
The Directors state in one voice that Su
perintendent Webster offered the Mission
High School proposition for the action of
the board, and explained that the Poly
technic at Bush and Stockton streets
could accommodate the commercial
classes of the Mission school, and by so
doing the latter institution would be what
it was intended to be, an academy and
not a mixed or business concern. The
members accepted his explanations, rea
sons and arguments and passed the order
closing the classes.
The executive committee of the Mission
High School Society yesterday detailed
certain of its members to interview the
Directors in order to learn their individ
ual views on the question. Sevenâ Stow,
Head, Holbrook. Cole. Brandenstein,
Conlon and Staffordâ were favorable to
consideration, while Eelis was strongly
opposed to such action. Bergerot and
Armstrong were not seen, and Kemp and
Gedge were non-committal.
Director Stafford said that he voted
solely on the advice of Superintendent
Webster. He was in no position to ex
amine deeply into the matter and took the
word of an experienced teacher such as
Mr. Webster undoubtedly is. He will vote
to reconsider if the question is favorably
received by the board.
Holbrook Is willing to take up the ques
tion again in the next board meeting. The
idea, which was Webster's, was to clear
all work out of the Mission Hight School
that was not purely academic, and that
appearing to be a good idea he voted for
It.
Stow was open to a change of heart,
but with him it was a matter of economy.
The board was in a deplorable state and
he will stand by any measure that will
save money.
Cole said the question was little con
sidered in the board meeting. It was
stated to be a wise, prudent and econom
ical measure and was simply moving the
commercial classes to their proper places.
He now saw there was a joker in the mat
ter and was favorable to reconsideration.
Eeli.s was unwilling to rescind any ac
tion. He wanted to see the institution a
High School and not a mere commercial
Institution.
Head was vary pronounced in favor of
reconsideration and rescinding the order.
He did not understand the question fully
when he voted for It, thinking the change
was merely to put the school on the same
course of study as the Lowell and Girls'
High schools. The thing had been rushed
through without sufficient thought.
Conlon misunderstood the full import of
abolishing a department of 103 pupils and
expressed himself as favorable to recon
sideration.
Kemp was non-committal and was dis
posed to stand by the action of the board.
Gedge wrapped himself in mystery and
answered his visitor's question by the
irrelevant query as to the whereabouts of
"that $10,000 worth of typewriters out in
the Mission High School." He could not
get away from the fact that his visitor
was not a newspaper man, and was asked
no more questions.
Dr. Clinton, chairman of the Mission
High School Society, at its meeting last
evening stated that he understood the
Polytechnic classes were so crowded that
it was utterly impossible to accommodate
any more students. He asked, if the Mis
sion commercial teachers must follow
their pupils to another school across the
city, why make the change? The Poly
technic classes now number from fifty to
sixty pupils, as many for each as one
teacher could handle. Director Head was
reported to have said that he was willing
to vote that the commercial department
of the Mission High School be continued
till June 30, when the present class will
finish the course.
. Over 100 petitions are being actively cir
culated through the Mission district for
signatures, and will contain several thou
sand names when they are presented in
protest to the board next Monday evening.
The alleged list of ousted teachers
which appeared in the Examiner yester
day morning occasioned considerable
fright to the owners of those names and
much amusement to the clerks in the
office of the Board of Education. A large
number of those teachers have been in
the School Department for a dozen years,
and only seven were elected since August
1, 1878.
Director Holbrook, chairman of the Fi
nance Committee, stated positively yes
terday that the board will not assume
nny debts contracted by the Normal
School after February 1. He also stated
that as Judge Seawell has rendered no de
cision the hands of the Directors are tied
up and no money can be paid out for sal
aries. The matter of this payment was
to have been settled at the meeting set
for next Monday evening, but now all
must await the decision of the court.
AN UNCONQUERED BRITISHER
Captain Johnson of the Ship Drum
craig Fined for Contempt of
Port.
Captain Johnson of the British ship
Drumcralp will shudder hereafter when
ever he hears the tune of "Yankee Doo
dle." His good ship was at the Mission
street wharf last Friday and the greater
part of her cargo was discharged there.
The remainder was to be discharged at a
wharf on Oakland CreÂ«k, and the captain
removed his ship thither without permis
sion of the Collector of the Port.
The matter was reported yesterday
moning to Collector Jackson by"Surveyor
Spear. The Collector imposed a line of
$500 upon the uneonquered Britisher, and
Xhv Drumcraip won't be allowed to move a
foot until the tine is paid in good Ameri
can gold.
Meyer Held for Trial.
Mortimer L. Meyer, tht young clerk
who took Miss Florence Cladding's dia
monds "Just for fun," was yesterday held
by Acting Judge Barry to answer before
the Superior Court on a charge of grand
larceny in JlOOti bonds. The Judge thought
it would be better to refer the question
of leniency to a Jury.

ODD FELLOWS
PREPARING FOR
IDE JUBILEE
Celebration Slated for
This City.
WILL BE HELD IN OCTOBER
THREE DAYS SET APART FOR
ITS OBSERVANCE.
The Convention Meets, Appoints Com
mittees and Adopts a Rough
Draft of the General
Programme.
The golden jubilee convention, which is
arranging for the celebration of the fifti
eth anniversary of the foundation of Odd
Fellowship in this State, met In Remem
brance Hall, Odd Fallows' building, last
night, and transacted a great deal of pre
liminary business. A rough draft of the
programme for the three days' celebra
tion, which will be held in this city, was
adopted, and chairmen for the various
committees were appointed. These chair
men, with President H. S. Jones, Secre
tary U. S. G. Clifford and Treasurer
George T. Shaw, will form the executive
committee and will establish headquarters
in room 1, Odd Fellows" building.
The first work of the convention last
night was the adoption of a skeleton pro
pnimme and the fixing of the actual dntes
for the celebration. Grand Secretary
Shaw and Past Grand Master Morrison
spoke at some length on this subject. Both
favored the selection of certain days
when the jubilee would be held in this
city and both were in favor of giving
lodges outside the city the privilege of
holding local celebrations at some pre
vious date. It was finally agreed that the
regular jubilee celebration be held in this
city on October 18, 19 and 20, and that out
side lodges be advised to hold their local
celebrations on or about the 9th of Sep
tember. This it is believed will prove
more than satisfactory, as the Odd Fel
lows throughout the State will be en
abled to celebrate both the jubilee day
of the State and their own anniversary
at one and the same time.
The programme was drafted and ac
cepted last night, as follows:
October 18â Grand reception In Wood
ward's Pavilion at 8 p. m., with addresses
by Mayor Phelan and prominent Odd Fel
lows.
October 19â Day grand street parade,
â with cantons in uniform and lodges In re
galia. Eveningâ Competitive drill by can
tons of Patriarchs Militant and Rebckah
Drill Corps in Mechanics' Pavilion. â 
October Excursion on the bay. Even
ingâDress parade, review and awarding
of prizes, closing with a grand ball.
This â is only a -skeleton of the pro
gramme. It is expected that it will be.
elaborated considerably and new and In
teresting features added, but all the fea
tures mentioned will be carried out.
The following chairmen of committees
were appointed by President Jones' and
ratified by the convention: Carriages â

The committee on souvenir badges was
Instructed to select a badge which will be
a novelty in its way. The design of this
badge will be kept secret until just before
the jubilee. Every member of the order
will be presented with one and they will
'also be for sale at some one designated
place. This will be the official badge and

of thousands is awarded by Judge Heb
bard, whose court is that of original ju
risdiction In the case, they may enjoy,
with the receiver, his hard-earned coin.
Yesterday the Supreme Court took an
unusual stand in the case. On the presen
tation of certain facts to the court by
E. S. Pillsbury and Garret McEnerney,
who are representing W. H. Martin and
John Ballard. defendants in the action re
cently instituted by Captain W. .A. Nev
ills, the Supreme Court put itself in the
place of the lower court, or court of orig
inal jurisdiction, and over the head of
Judge Hebbard, and fixed the amount of
the surety to be placed In the hands of the
court to guarantee against loss on the
appeal from the order appointing the re
ceiver.
The history of the case up to the time
the Supreme Court took this unusual
step is interesting, the step of the Su
preme Court being the most interesting,
however. Nevills filed suit last Monday
morning for the purpose of establishing
a copartnership over the Add mine,
claiming that with Martin and Ballard he
was the owner of the mine, but had been
driven from his lands by an armed force.
The complaint was taken before Judge
Hebbard, and without delay, on the mo
tion of Nevills' attorneys, he appointed
Myer Jacobs receiver. With all haste
Jacobs hurried to the mines, and Wednes
day a telegram was received by Judge
Hebbard, in which it was stated that the
receiver was in possession of the mines.
Tuesday morning, the day after the orig
inal complaint was filed, E. S. Pillsburv
went before Judge Hebbard and asked
that the court ftx the amount of bond on
appeal from the order. Judge Hebbard
put the matter over, and the following
day another delay resulted, and when the
matter finally came b#fore the courtâ its
object being to prevent the receiver from
taking possession of the minesâ Judge
Hebbard stated that the receiver was
already in charge, and he refused to fix
the bond. T 1 'S was a surpising setback
for Mr. Pillstjury. and it was decided to
take the matter before the Supreme
Court. In terse language this court made
the desired order, and immediately on
filing the bond required by the court Mr.
Jacobs will step down and out until the
order of the lower court has either been
ordered revoked or ratified. In event of
the first condition Mr. Jacobs will be out
of office for good, in the latter visions of
his fee will doubtless render his labor
one of love. The order of the Supreme
Court fixing the amount of the bond and
on its fulfillment removing Jacobs reads:
Good cause therefor appearing, it is hereby
ordered that upon the execution and filing with
the clerk of this court of a written under
taking on the part of appellants in the penal
sum of $50,000, with sureties to be approved
by Hon. W. H. Beatty. Chief Justice of this
court, to the effect that if the order appoint
ins a receiver made and filed in the Superior
S? urt , of the State 6t California in and for
the city and county of San Francisco; on the
23d day of January, 1899. in that certain action
entitled W. A. Nevills. plaintiff, vs. William
H. Martin and John Ballard, defendants and
numbered No. 67.262 on the records of said
court, and from which said order an appeal
has been taken to this court, be affirmed or
the appeal be dismissed, the appellants will
pay all damages which the respondents, or
either of them, may sustain by reason of such
stay, not exceeding said amount, then that all
proceedings under said order in the court be
low be stayed pending this appeal, and that
upon the filing of said undertaking Myer Ja
cobs Esq., the receiver, be and he is hereby
ordered to forthwith restore and surrender all
property of whatsoever kind or nature taken
or held by him under or by virtue of said order
appointing him receiver to the parties from
whom said property was taken.
So matters stand. Nevills has two suits
on file in this city, one to determine the
co-partnership, the other to declare that
the stock held by Martin an- Ballard Is
simply held in trust by them for the
benefit of himself and wife. He has also
carried the matter into the courts of
Tuolumne County, and the receiver has
been appointed at the instance of his
lawyers. For a time things came his way,
but the Supreme Court has reversed mat
ters and the Issues of the controversy will
be determined by due process of law,
whether or not a receiver Is deprived of a
generous fee and his following doomed to
disappointment.

FIGHTING FOR SAMOA
0- beach road at Apia, close
to where the point of Mataatu
forms the eastern horn of the
bay, there stands a wooden
house. It is a well-to-do re
spectable dwelling, of the roomy
tropical typÂ«, with wide, cool veran
das, screened by lattice work. You
can see dozens of such houses in Apia,
but this one is remarkable chiefly be
cause it supplies a tragic reminiscence
cf the great Sarnoan battle fought at
Mataatu in ISS3.
It was one of the fiercest fights that
. thÂ» Samoans. within the memory of
white men. have ever had. and the
curious thing is that history is now re
peating itself. An exactly similar con
dition of affairs prevails to-day in Sa
moa as ten years ago, the only differ
ence being that Mataafa, instead of
defending. Is now holding the position.
All day long the fight raged around
this point and the house I have men
tioned stood right fn the line of fire.
Here the only white man who lost his
. ! life In the struggle was slain, and even
cow you can see the hole in the veran
da post made by the heavy Snider
" bullet after it had passed through the
man's body. The lawyer who lives
there delights to tell the story. "He
was the captain of a trading schooner
then In port," he said, -and had com*
to see mÂ© on a matter of Dusmess. ** Â©
â wot* standing on th* steps talking, Just
her*, when "suddenly he threw up his
arms and pitched headlong down the
stairs. I got him into the house quick
enough, for I was scared of stray bul
lÂ«ts myself. Of course it was an ac
cident and the Sampans were very sorry
about It. It Is a wonder more Euro
' peans were not killed in the same way,
for the shot were dropping about thÂ«
town all day."
At that time Tamasese held thÂ«
peninsula of "Mulinuu. where Mataafa
" Is now encamped with several thou- \
ar: of his followers. This spot has
â¢ been looJUd upon from time immemo
â¢ â¢ rial as th* King's special residence.
â¢ Why it is hard to understand, because
It possesses no natural advantages, and
from a strategical point of view Is a
very undesirable place for an army to
occupy.
The peninsula simply a long sandy
â¢ spit, raised but a few feet above the
. level of the lagoon, and Joined to Apia
by a narrow neck of land. On one side
It faces a shallow, marshy lagoon, and
Is therefore very unhealthy, while no
fresh water is to be obtained on It.
Hence all the enemy has "to do is to
blockade the narrow end of the spit
. and the place becomes untenable for
any length of time. Â»
For this reason Tamasese did not
â wait to be attacked on llulinuu, but
â¢ spread out his lines so as to embrace
the whole of Apia Bay. Mataafa, se
cure in the mountainous, scrub-covered
country to the rear, chose his own time
for attack, and outflanking Tamasese,
drove him step by, step back to lluli
: nuu. whence he # was eventually com
â¢pelled to withdraw.
The Samoans are certainly not pci
entiflc fighters. They have very little
knowledge of tactics, and no effective
method of organizing their forces. Dis
cipline can hardly be said to- exist, the
armies consist merely of an aggrega
tion of untrained, half-naked "savages,
*ach one of whom fights or -runs away
at his own sweet pleasure. And a

Increased the loss of life in these eon-
En the recent, great battle, when
Mataafa succeeded in ambushing Mj
lietoa, and several thousand men were
engaged, only -thirteen were said to
have been slain. In the old days. In
stead of firing away at each other from
a safe distance the warriors rushed to
close quarters and the battle became a
series of personal combats. One or the
other or perhaps both of the fighters
was bound to go down, and there was
an end of him. No quarter was shown,
the Samoan's one idea being to secure'
the head of his fallen enemy and carry
It j around with him in order that he
may exhibit It as a trophy. No youth,
Is considered a. full-fledged warrior un- j
til he has slain his man. and the head
is his certificate of graduation.
In spite of the opposition of the mis
sionaries this practice of head -cutting
still prevails, and there are plenty of '
men in Apia who will, tell you how the
natives returned from battle, walking
through the streets of Apia, each man
carrying his ghastly trophy In a basket.
And after the fight at Mataatu one of "'
the most tragic incidents conceivable |
occurred. . i .â -
Night had fallen and a group of na- â¢
tives were seated in one of the large
houses, which was Illumined only by a
flickering flare of cocoanut shells. With
them, too, were the women, grieving
sorely, ! for the chief of the household
had fallen in battle, and no one knew
where his head was. Then, from the '
darkness outside there came a great
shout, as from an enemy, and a round
object- was hurled into the house. \ It
rolled around the floor, staining the
clean mats as it pursued Its ghastly
course, and then came to a stop before
the daughter of the. house, who was
weeping bitterly. It was her father's
head.
The chivalrous manner in which the
Samoans treat their women during war
Is In' pleasant contrast to this barbarity.
.The women are privileged neutrals;
they can go and come between the lines
as they choose, bringing food and water
to their husbands or relatives, and car
rying backward and forward all the
gossip of the war. It is considered the
most; disgraceful, of all acts to kill a
woman; the man who does so becomes
an outcast. Consequently, even ia the
fiercest battle the women's lives are
.r.deed. a chance shot
strikes them.
It is hard to say how the conflict
now raging in Samoa will end. If
Mataafa maintains the supremacy
which he seems to have gained over
Tanu the treaty powers will
probably have to recognise his rule.
But Chief Justice Chambers has ex
pressly declared that Mataafa's election
by the na" - - ,ry to the pro
aa of the Berlin treaty and that
the young Bfattetoa is Kin?. If the Ber
lin treaty is to be regarded as anything
more than a farcical document this de
- n will have to be upheld by force
of arms, or else the prestige of Euro
peans in Samoa will be gone for ever.
The whole trouble has been brought
about by the unfortunate consent of the
-* to the return of Mataafa from
his "X:la on Jaluit. Nobody, of course,
could foresee that the chief would re
turn just at the time of old Malietoa"3
death, and just when his presence
would do thÂ« most harm. Had Mataafa,
been away, it la probable that the na
tives would have quietly elected a Kin*
for themselves, all the sectarian bitter
ness which has been stirred up -would
have : been -avoided â¢- and Saznoan. life â¢
would have S gone on In : the good j old
fashioned," sleepy manner..
It Is Impossible to overlook the fact
that the complications are due entirely
to the Intrigues of German : officials at
Apia. For years the Germans have
cherished the 'most. intense hatred of t
Mataafa, yer suddenly! they, consent to
his return from exile. They have never
forgiven Mataafa since the day when he ,
Inflicted a disastrous defeat on their
sailors at Vanele r yet now they propose -
to make him King. ' ;
There Is a monument Â«at Mullnuu, - a
handsome granite affair, '"â  erected in
honor of some forty brave Germans
who were killed' by Mataafa's men, and .
who, as the Inscription puts It, rest
there for their country's sake.
The point is a very sore one .to Ger

lAM a fatalist, most certainly. I
believe that "whatever is to be will
be," and that no amount of study
or plan or personal effort can
change a man's career or his destiny.
Perhaps my Scotch Presbyterian an
cestry and my early training in the
doctrines of predestination, foreordina
tion, and the like, influence me in the
belief which 1 hold. I do not admit
that there is either such a thing aB ac
cident or free will in the story of hu
man life.
If a man starts to go across the street
and for some reason â or no reason aD
parer.tly â turns back and thus escapes
the death which Beemingly waited for
him on the other side, it is clear to me
that that especial form of death was
not waiting for him at all, but for the
man whom It caught.
Fate, which I consider to be the man
ifestation of the will of Providence,
governs all things. Born with certain
forces, many of which I inheritedâ for
WHY I BROKE AWAY FROM CHRISTIAN SCIENCE.
WITH the rise .nnd tremendous spread of healing by faith-cure,
mind-cure, spiritualism, Christian science, or hypnotism (for
the working basis is the same in all, namely, passivity under
oral or mental suggestion*, the subject finds himself swept
away by what seems a new revelation; whereas he is only wit
nessing or experiencing the repetition of phenomena as old as
human nature.
The experience of finding one's bodily Bymptoms changed, without the
aid of customary remedies, and simply at another's dictation, almost In
variably unfits the convalescent for logical thought or sober action.
To the neophyte any analysis of cause and effect is bewildering; and
this is the precise reason why it ought not to be considered unpardonable,
if a ior.g-suffeiing invalid, finding, relief through a novel remedy, tem
porarily evinces excessive exuberance and irrational enthusiasm. The
remedy may bo of any natureâ a patent decoction, a trip to sunny dimes
or Immersion in saline waters; but the effects on the patient's mind are
akin.
Gratitude for the cure and pronencss to overestimate the curative
mot red invariably follow unexpected restoration to health. Furthermore,
temperamental ardor nnd a disposition to require a helper are commend
able reelings, which rightly influence the recipient of a boon or benefit.
The ir.lnd. thus on duty bent, naturally exalts the healing agency Into
a divine personality, endowing the human personality with supernatural.
n>-'t to say delfic. power; ar.d. as a rule, all obstructions or arguments
brought to bear against this determined line of action only serve to fix the
misdirection oven more immovably. Some such tendencies arc seen when
parents wish and attempt to detach a daughter's affections from one whom
they deem unworthy. Opposition quickens instead of quenching girlish
ardor.
Were the mind of the convalescent !ess absorbed in the curative won
der reason would urge the necessity and wisdom of looking more deeply
into the history of such phenomena; and of fortifying one's self against
misjudgment and reaction by a careful comparison of the case in hand
with the multiplicity of similar rases, relieved through such noted men as
Kesmcr. Qreatrake*. Oassner, Braid, Richter, the Abbot Prince of Hohen
loho and a host of others.
That such- a course was not pursued by a newly recovrred patient under
the so-called Christian science method upward of twenty years ago might
y,o excusable; since at that date It was almost impossible to find books
devoted to the history and analysis of mental phenomena. Able thinkprn
had not then begun the study of psychology in dead earnest, or with llxed
heredity Is a great factor In this world 'â 
â I was played upon by circumstances j
and became what I am. My fate was \
marked out for me and I followed It. ;

As to '"individual effort," the man '
who thinks he Is "self-made" generally j
worships his creator too blindly to pay
any unselfish attention to anything; or
any one else, and his example is not
usually good to follow.

WHAT Is fate? In its first mean
ing it is the thing spoken. It
implies a speaker who de
termines what is to be. Ancient poly
thelsts made fate an unexplainable
necessity, to whiÂ«*h even the gods must
bcnv. If we are monotheists we need no
such impersonal power. I have no use
for fate. I have a profound belief in
an all-wise and overruling: Providence.
I recognise him in the orderings of my
own life, in the careers of others, in
the world movements of the age.

this world of ours. We hav^ become
accustomed to trace back certain ef

his dominions at the expense of the

As far as man's individuality is con

of good judgment, is the mainspring of
his career. A man with good judgment
will order his life along lines which will J
not conflict with existing conditions,
and he therefore will make the best of
himself and his opportunities. From
whatever source he receives his good

COD has offered to the people of
the United States the fairest field
on earth for working out success
fully the problems of social life.
In extent of territory and varie
ties of soil and climate; in wood,
coal and the useful and precious
metals; in its ocean frontage and mag
nificent harbors, its watercourses,
great lakes and rivers, no country sur
passes it.
In its institutions, civil and religious
liberty are guaranteed to every citizen.
The Declaration of Independence, a
sort of preamble to our constitution, de
clares that life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness are man's inalienable
birthrights. When that declaration was
made good by seven years of success
ful revolution, and a form of govern
ment had to be framed for the new na
tionality, we embodied in our constitu
tion, State and Federal, the principle
that this is a government of the people,
by the people, for the people.
Are we equal to the task of doing our
part to realize the opportunities af
forded by a beneficent Providence and
by wise legislative enactment? It is
an important question. Our ship of
suitf must have a harbor and must
have an anchorage. Storms arise on
the most pacific sea|fc and without this
harbor and this anchorage the ship will
founder or be drive;; upon the recks.
That harbor is in religion; that anchor
age is in the hearts or consciences of
men.
Gentlemen, I speak a plain truth. It
is borne out by every page of human
history. lam not speaking at this mo
ment as a dogmatist, but as a common
citizen and a student of history. I
am not speaking as a denominational
ist, but uttering a universal proposi
tion. Society is not a mere human
compact between men to live together
after a certain form of civil govern
ment, such as two or more men enter
into in forming a partnership to carry
on a stated business. The forms that
shall govern in civil life are left to the
free choice of men to determine, but
society itself is heaven-born. It is as
divine in its origin as is religion Itself.
By nature and by destiny man Is at one
and the same time a social being and a
religious being, and it is God that has
made him so.
* â¦ â¢
While God has revealed and ordained
certain things in the religious require
ments of life, he has left man to frame
the laws that suit him best or please
him best in civil life. But. so intimately
are his religious life and his civil life
allied to each other that the principles
which shall enable him to carry out
successfully a civil code to secure to
man the protection of life, liberty and
character come from and are anchored
in religion. In a word, God is the au
thor of civil society, as he is the author
of the religious society; but while giv
ing the form of the religious society he
has left man free to choose whatever
form he prefers for civil lifeâmonar
chial, imperial or republican. The end of
civil society, however, nd matter what
its form, is the same â to secure man his
civil rights, life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness.
Man, therefore, can make laws In
civil life. But he cannot make princi
ples. God gives these, and, in forming
these two societies he lays down the
principles underlying both. All the ele
ments of civil life existed in germ when
there were but two people on the earth.
The two societies were then and there
formed. And God who placed men there
provided fully for tiielr life, liberty and
happiness when he started them on
their term of earthly existence. He laid
down a code of laws that should em
conviction that psychology involved a science; though evidence was not
lacking, did one know how and where to search for it, which would have
gone far to prove "there was nothing new under the sun"; plenty of
things new to the ignorant, but. old, so old. to the wise.
Paracelsus, as far back as the fifteenth century, wrote as follows:
"Whether the object of your faith be real or false, you will nevertheless
obtain the same effects. Thus, if I believe in St. Peter's statue, as I should
have believed In Kt. Peter himself. I shall obtain the same effects that I
should have obtained from St. Peter. But that is superstition. Faith,
however, produces miracles; and whether It Is a true or a false faith It
will always work the same wonders. â¢ â¢' â¢ One belief, theory or faith
works as well as another, provided the operator believes thoroughly in his
own method and practice."
In view of these facts Is It necessary to believe, even though many
euros are wrought by Christian scientists, that Mary Eddy, their leader,
is therefore the human wonder in heaven mentioned in the Book of Rev
elation, or that her "Science and Health" is literally the "little
book" therein described?
Going farther, is !t of the slightest importance, bo far as the healthful
results are concerned, that Christian science should be considered a "spe
cial revelation" to ar.d through its chief exponent? All testimony proves
to the contrary If students believe the fundamental tenets of the doctrine,
that alone is requisite for the desired results.
As regards Christian science, note the opinion of Thomas Jay Hudson,
1.L.D., in his book called "The Law of Psychic Phenomena." He says:
"The healers by this pystx-m have stumbled upon the machinery of mental
thcrapetitlcs without having the least comprehension of the real princi
ples which underlie their 80-callfrd science, or that its ancient history is
the record of the supcrsitions of all the nations of the earth. It Is "not
known whether the founder of this school of Christian science ever stopped
to reduce the foundation principles to the form of a syllogism. Let us see
how thc-y would look in the form of a syllogism: Matter has no existence;
our bodies are composed of matter; therefore our bodies have no exist
ence. It follows, of course, that disease cannot exist in a non-existent
body. Of course no serious argument can be adduced against such a self
evident absurdity.
"It would shock the commonsense and Insult the Intelligence of patients
wore it not for the all-powerful counter-fact before his senses that health
Is restored and another victory scored for the healer; another recruit
added to the ranks of the great army which had agreed not t.o question,
not to think."
This book of Hudson's is one of a series which has appeared within
tive power exists, giving direction to
life's actions. A great preacher said
with emphasis, outstretching his long
arms and bending his bony fingers in
energetic grip: "Young man, you want
success in lifeâ take it." I would add:
"Man, you desire happiness â take it.
You want heaven here as well as here
afterâtake it. It is within your reactt.
Be not a plaything; be a man. You may
rule, be king, if you so will."

I AM no believer In the beautiful
theory that we are moved in all
things by a power stronger than
ourselves. It Is all rot and non

power of the Almighty is to a certain
extent guided 'by- Providence simply
because he loves God. But the sugges
tion that this man is preordained to be
a lawyer, and that man a doctor, and
you a Journalist and I a politician, is
to my mind ridiculous. Circumstances
aro what we make them; they do not
make or unmake us. Man of his own
will seeks his vocation in life; takes up
one calling .and drops it; takes up an
other and drops that, and so goes on
until he finds his natural groove. Ef
fort, effort, effort, therein lies the se
cret. Nothing was ever accomplished

That code embraces the principles
that must underlie every civil govern
ment â else the government is a sham
and a snare. And not only must the
principles of the code inhere in the civil
state, but the civil state cannot enforce
its own enactments without them and
without the author of them â God. The
code in question is known to the world
as the "Ten Commandments." The
home, the family, is the unit of society.
It is sacred. The true man lives in and
for his home. Society is to protect
him in this. There Is the field wherein
he is labor for life, liberty and happi
ness in their fullness. For this property
is necessary. Property, therefore, is sa
cred. For this happiness his honor and
his good name are the highest species
of possession. He must be protected
in them. All this was ordained by God
when he made man. See how he pro
vides for it.
After asserting his own absolute right
and dominion and declaring that his
name must not be profaned, God com
mands that one day in seven be conse
crated to him in a religious rest. Thus,
by divine ordinance the weary, toil
laden workingman is secured one day
in seven to spend, with wife and fam
ily, and recruit his wasted strength.
Worklngmen of America, I say to you,
do not set' little store on this divine
law. ; Ifi-a public sentiment in Amer
ica, declares that by right divine .you:
are entitled to this day of rest, it has
grown / out of this commandment. Do
not be too ready to say, "Hands off,
we want no religious legislation."
When greed and gold rule this land
entirely, you shall have no day of rest.
Human life is abundant and. conse
quently cheap. See to it that you rec
ognize the power that is your friend.
â¢ Â« - * ,
The remaining commandments speci
fically provide for the security of life,
liberty and happiness, if their spirit
be theoretically and practically in
grafted upon the civil law. "Honor thy
father and thy mother" establishes the
home, the normal condition of man.
The home is the cradle and the nur
sery of society. The nation's strength
consists in the number and the inde
pendence of its homes; in their comfort,
their peace, their happiness. For the
success of this home a sancity must
surround it and enshrine it in the
hearts of the children and the esteem
of men; and for this end God. in an
other commandment, provides that hus
band and wife shall be faithful to each
other. Blight that sancity, cast even
suspicion upon it, and the light and
happiness have gone out from it; one
of the pillars of the nation is shaken,
for you corrupt society in its source.
Life is sacred. No man has an ab
solute right even to his own life. It
belongs to God who gave it. There
fore, "Thou shalt not kill." Property
is sacred. Therefore, "Thou shalt not
steal." Nay, more, thou shalt not even
covet thy neighbor's goods. Honor,
character is sacred. Therefore, "Thou
shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbor."
â¢ * *
In these are embraced the things that
make up life, liberty and happiness.
Civil laws are intended to compass
these and secure men in them. They

HALL CAINE ON
JOURNAL
ISM
LONDON, Jan. 16.â Hall Calne has
returned to England with his
experience of men and things
vastly widened and improved by
a close acquaintance with Amer-
lean journalism. I called upon
Mr. Came soon after his arrival in
London, being prompted to do so to
some extent by the publication in a
leading newspaper here of an interview
with himself, in which he records his
experience with the literary gentlemen
of the United States in his own clever
way.
"The mistake made by many who
but cannot even then reform the cul
prit.
But what does the code of the ten
commandments say? "Thou shalt not
covet thy neighbor's wife"; not even
entertain a thought that might lead to
it or to sully the beauty of thine own
soul. "Thou shalt not kill," indeed; but
more than that, thou shalt not be an
gry with thy brother, not envy him in
his rightful possessions; not even
against thine enemy shalt thou harbor
any hatred or ill will. "Thou shalt not
steal," indeed; but more than that,
thou shalt not even covet what belongs
to another, not desire another's goods
without wishing to make compensation
for them. "Thou shalt not bear false
witness against thy neighbor" â not
falsely swear away his good name, his
reputation; but more than that, thou
shalt not even judge him rashly or un
justly, though the judgment be never
uttered.
** . *
The civil law cannot enter Into man's
heart and will; and yet there is where
adulteries and murders and robberies
and perjuries take their rise. .
God made man for civil life, but he
has a higher life, and that civil life can
not reach his ideal disconnected with
the principles of this higher life. And
this appeals to common-sense as well
as to the individual experience of men
and the history of the world.
Take a society, no matter what the
form of government be, every member
of which is imbued with- these everlast
ing and eternal principles of right and
justice â with God behind them reward
ing and jpunishing-;-and tell me if the
civil law has not heÂ»re an auxiliary that
no mere human legislation can fashion
for itself? Unless conscience controls
in the inner court of the soul, civil law
is a lifeless thing. At any moment our
life, our property, our honor, may be
brought into jeopardy. The civil law
must protect us in these. They depend
for their protection upon the oath of a
juror, a witness, a Judge, a lawyer.
The.=e several officials raise their hands
to high heaven and call on God to wit
ness the integrity of their word and
act, and upon that integrity all de
pends. I say if these men attach no
religious Importance to their oath, then
no civil law, however equitable the let
ter of its enactments may be, can af
ford us any ample protection. There
fore do I say that our heaven of refuge
is in religion; the anchorage of our
hopes in God.
Washington himself confirms this. He
did not place our greatness in extent
of territory, its fertility, its commerce;
nor in our army, our navy, nor even In
our just and wise legislation. No, but
he placed it just where I have placed
it. He says: "Let it simply be asked,
where is the security for property, for
reputation, for life itself, if the sense
of religious obligation deserts the oaths
that are the Instruments of Investiga
tion in courts of justice?"
â¢ * *
There is the principle in a nutshell.
In our form of government, a dele
gated government, not only the ordi
nary courts of law are the courts of
justice for us. But our executive of
fices, our Legislatures, State and na
tional, are for us courts of justice; and
fidelity in them, according to Washing
ton, is secured by the sense of relig
ious obligation which the official atÂ«
taches to the oath he takes when ac
cepting the power we delegate to him.
Abundant natural resources, just laws
written on paper, beautiful declarations
of rights, powerful armies and navies,
cannot secure to us life, liberty and
happiness, unless this law of God con
trol in our civil affairs.
Gentlemen, here is something for the
workingmen of America to study. We
cannot change the laws that underlie
human life and human nature any more
than we can change the law of gravi
tation, and the nation or the people
that ignores them and thinks it can
dispense with them invites upon Itself

the last two decades, and muÃt lead to investigation and research.
With reference to the alleged Inspiration of "Science and Health" It Is
often asked of those who sojconsider it which of the hundred editions Is
the correct one. since the changes are many? It Is Interesting to compare
the contradictory views held by Mrs. Eddy on various topics since 1875, the
date of her first editions.
Note what she has published about organization, for instance. In tho
original "Science and Health," issued in 1875, pages 166 and 167, the author
says: "The mistake the disciples madeâ to found religious organizations
and church rites, if, indeed, they did thisâ was one the Master did not
make. * â¦ â¢ No time was lost by our Master in organizations, rites and
ceremonies, or in proselyting for certain fcrms of belief. â¢ â¢ â¢ We have
no record that forms of church worship were-lnstituted by our great
spiritual teacher, Jesus of Nazareth; and we learn the improbability of this
In the science of God, which he taught and demonstrated. â¢ * â¢ A mag
nificent edifice was not tho sign of the church of Christ."
Some years afterward Mrs. Eddy says: "At a meeting of the Christian
Scientists Association in April, 1879, it was voted to organize a church to
commemorate tho words and works of our Master."
Again in ISS9 Mrs. Eddy says, on pages 53 and 54 of "Retrospection":
"This church was dissolved because I saw the time had come when much
lime and attention must be given to defend this church from the envy
and molestation of other churches, and the danger to its members which
lies in Christian warfare. â¢ â¦ â¢ Despite the prosperity of my church, it
was learned that material organization has its value and peril, and that
organization is requisite only in the earliest periods of Christian history- "
In the November, 1891. issue of the Christian Science Journal she says:
"To organize and support churches is the proper way at present to build
up tho cause of Christian science."
On page 32 of her "Miscellaneous Writings" Mrs. Eddy says; "Distinct
denominational and social organizations and societies are at present neces
sary for the Individual and for the cause."
We read on page 01 of the same book: "It Is not Indispensable to or
ganize materially Christ's churches; it is not absolutely necessary to or
dain pastors and dedicate churches; but if this is done, let it be in conces
sion to tho period and not as a perpetual or indispensable ceremonial of
the church. If our church is organized it is to meet the demand. Suffer
it to be so now!"
Page 127: "God hath indeed smiled upon my churchâ this daughter of
Zion. She sltteth in high places; and to deride her is to incur the penalty
of which the Hebrew bard spoke these words, 'The Lord shall havo them
In derision!
have written disparaging things about
the American newspaper man," said
Mr. Calne, "Is In supposing that the
gentleman who Interviews you. who
meets you at the steamer dock, and
calls you out of bed at midnight to'
ask some trivial question, is the whole
field of American journalism. Too
many travelers in America do that. The
extraordinary vigor of the every-day
work of the American journalist is
what first impresses you. He is always
'on the nail. 1 To-day's subject is to
day's need, and whether It is the fate
of the Philippines or how to sweep the
snow out of the streets, the journalist
tackles it for all it Is worth. Then the
general enterprise of the American
press is beyond comparison greater
than that of almost every other press
in the world. Not even the London
Times, or Telegraph, or Standard, with
their correspondents in every capital,
can suwpass the amazing enterprise of
the best papers in America.
"Remember that by reason of dis
tance the material of the American
paper costs incomparably more, and
that nearly every day's paper contains
columns of cabled news. Then the
Sunday papers of America, whatever
we may think of them as literary pro
ducts, are examples of journalistic en
terprise without parallel in the world.
Outside London there is nothing pub
lished, whether in' Paris, Berlin, Vienna
or Rome, which for interest or duality
or yet bulk bears a moment's compari
son with the best American Sunday
papers.
"Then the imagination shown In the
construction and mapping out of a typ
ical American newspaper, to meet the
needs of the largest number of read
ers, is another striking characteristic.
Therefore, when we gibe, as it is so
easy to do, at the unconscientious and
even vulgar aspects of some American
journalism, we should remember its
good qualities, which are neither few
nor hard to find."
"Can you give me some of your ex
periences with the American interview
er, Mr. Caine?"- 1 asked.
"There were many varieties of them,"
was the reply. "Some were honest.
Some were entirely indifferent to the
correctness of their interviews and
made me say many things that I should
no more think of saying than of trying
to fly. More lady journalists are now
engaged as interviewers than formerly
and they do their work well. As migfit
be expected their personal descriptions
are embarrassingly precise. The color
of your hair and eyes and the pattern
of your clothes are facts of the first im
portance. Hardly any American in
terviewers, male or female, write short
hand, and as a consequence the visitor
talks the idiom of the reporter. In
certain interviews I found myself say
ing: 'It makes me tired' and 'it tickles
me to death.'
"Several imaginary interviews with
me were published during my stay in
New York. In one of these I called Mr.
Winter a 'liar.' In another I gave a
modest description of my own head,
saying 'the upper part' resembled
Shakespeare and the 'lower part' re
sembled Christ! These flamboyant fic
tions are, I observe, the tit-bits oftenest
quoted in England by journals which
most affect to look down on American
journalism. But whatever the inter
viewer may be it is folly of the English
man in America to attempt to escape
him. As a general statement I think it
would be true that whether you allow
yourself {o be interviewed or refuse to
allow yourself to be interviewed you
are equally certain to regret It. But
that has been my experience In Eng
land also.
"But you asked me for experiences
with the interviewer. Here are a few:
During the run of 'The Christian" at
the Knickerbocker Theater there was
a sad and terrible incident. A young
actress died of heart disease in the
course of a performance. I chanced
to be in the theater at the moment of
the death, and I was still suffering
from the shock when I returned to the
hotel. Between midnight and 1 o'clock
in the morning a reporter sent up his
card. He must see me at once, if only
for a moment. I saw him at the door of
my bedroom. 'It's about this poor
young lady,' he said. "Well?' 'She
Again Mrs. Eddy writes on page 319: "Our church edifice must be built
In 1894. Take thither thy saintly offerings and lay them In the out
stretched hand of God. No doubt must intervene between the promise
and the event. Push upward our prayer In stone, and God will give thÂ©
benediction."
On page 270 we read: "Shall we depart from the example of the Mas
ter in Christian science, Jesus of Nazareth, than whom mankind has no
higher ideal?"
Once more, on page 273, she says: "I close my college (organization)
to work in other directions, where I seem to be most needed."
In 1889 Mrs. Eddy wrote: "In the scant history of Jesus and of his
disciples we have no biblical authority for a public institution."
On page 145 of "Miscellaneous Writings" she says: "The church, more
than any other institution at present, is the cement of society; but tha
time cometh when It will need no organization to express It."
It is but natural that the promulgator of any doctrine or system should
wish and attempt to provide for the permanence and dissemination of hla
Ideas.
Therefore he seeks and is sure to find adherents whose minds can be
molded to suit the teacher's views, and who will utilize the weaknesses
of their fellow men in making converts to the proposed new gospel, and
this leads irresistibly into organization.
Every leader in a new religious direction declares that his inspiration
is from on high, but in most cases he goes farther. He not only asserts a
partnership with the Almighty but claims such nearness to God as makes
his own human personality the immediate and only channel of communi
cation between Deity and humanity.
Into what dubious moral tangles and jungles this procedure may lead
who can say?
The astute prophet, once embarked on this ship of oracular divination,
makes it a special study how to gain credit for supernatural information
if the results of prediction are satisfactorily popular or how to avoid dis
graceful responsibility if the tide turns the other way.
The priestesses of the Delphi oracle were vexed with the same problem
that greets soothsayersâ how to make the fame words mean opposita
things accordingly as the utterance is understood by different listeners.
Of this doubleness we have a very ancient example To a general inquir
ing about his chances of success the oracle replied, "I tell thee, O Pyrr
hus. that you the Romans are able to overcome!" a response which might
mean that Pyrrhus should overcome the Romans or that they might over
come Pyrrhus. Such predictions are sure of being verified, whatever tha
result.

way, Mr. Calne, I haven't read your

an extraordinary coincidence?' 'Per
haps it is, but for mercy's sake don't

VOLUMES have been published eulogizing the work done by our
brave soldiers and sailors during the late war. But nothing so
far has been placed before the public of the real work done by
women during the awful days following San Juan and Manila.
The Call, through its columns to-day, presents to its read

their turn earned and will receive the plaudits of both men and women.
The symposium which the Sunday Call presents to its readers to

men; and to those who acted and to those who were merely onlookers
the words of these heroic women will send a thrill of pride and admir

Worsen of California Rose to the Occasion.
By Mrs. W. B. Harrington,
Pnsident of the State Red Cross Societ/.
THE Red Cross of California may
well be termed a searchlight of ex
ceeding power. It brought to light
in every hamlet in the Stat<^ women
of brains and executive ability, who,
when called from the humdrum duties
of everyday life, responded quickly and
intelligently.
The Red Cross auxiliaries of Califor
nia number over 100. To them has been
intrusted tho responsibility- of caring
for every detail of work, of placing the
means of collecting funds and of using
the best methods of disbursement. Thus
the latent power of woman was brought
out.
The opinion prevailed to some extent
that a largo class of the women of Cal
ifornia, at least in our cities, were in
capable of earnest effort and that those
with hom^s on ranches and away
from the rush and excitement were not
fitted to cope with philanthropic work
on a large scale. How false are both

kindly appreciations of Red Cross work
received daily from mothers, sisters and
sweethearts of our country's defenders
show that the women of the Golden

patriotism.
Throughout the East it has been
thought a marvel by those to whom the
planning and executing of great works
of charity is a familiar task, that the

extent their experience, should in such
a brief period have originated and car

My first trip among the business
houses of our city, however, completely
reconciled me to my lot, for in three
days I collected over $3500, many of the
sums given being accompanied by cor
dial invitations to "come again" if
necessary. I was struck, even in those
first days, by the widespread feeling of
generosity, the willingness with which
even those who could ill afford to give
! anything gave what they could and
gladly. People seemed to have learned
by inspiration, almost, the lesson of
giving, and while some gave hundreds
of dollars others bound themselves to
pay 25 cents a month, and scarcely any
one refused to add a mite to the general
fund.

President of the Oakland Convalescent Soldiers' Home.
IWISH to speak in terms of the
highest praise concerning the work
done by our Oakland women during
the past ten months for the relief,
the rare and the comfort of our coun

Mrs. Granville Abbott, president of
the Oakland Red Cross, is peculiarly
Jit tod for tho duties of that onerous po
sition, and she guided and directed her
enthusiastic co-workers with judgment
so excellent and tact so unfailing that
no hiatus of supply nor friction of opin

of the organization. Her executive
board was composed of ladies who for
the time being devoted themselves ut

sult that perfect order and system pre
vailed and all that was done was well
done.
While I had charge of the Oakland
table at the ferry my thirty-live as

of Oakland society â rose at 4 in the

By Mrs. Russell Sage.
MY interest in the Woman's Na

first awakened by Mrs. Ellen Har
din Walworth, who called to see
me one afternoon long before war was
proclaimedâ at a time when there was
even a possibility that the Vexed Cu
ban question would be settled by arbi
tration. When she first broached her
plan to me of a society of women band
ed together for the relief of soldiers
in a war which had not been declared
as yet, I exclaimed In astonishment at
the very idea of such a thing being
necessary.
She said: "We must be in shape to
take hold of It when it comes. Will
you allow your name to be used?"
I consented to this on condition that
I was put on no committee, as I was

before, how warm are Californian
hearts, and it was more than a pleasure
to see how the plea "for the soldiers"
found a ready response everywhere.
San Francisco alone contributed over
$60,000 for Red Cross work, and over
10.000 badges at $1 each were sold to
add to the amount collected.
The school children should be par
ticularly mentioned here, for they
proved themselves veritable little pa
triots. Many of them denied themselves
in different ways to send in a few
nickels each month. Some devoted all
the time possible outside school hours
to earning, "soldier money." Others
held fairs and parlor sales for the same
object, and scarcely one failed to con
tribute in some way to the Red Cross
treasury, by means of which so much
real good was accomplished.

While we worked in the lunch room'
other Oakland women were busy col
lecting and forwarding fresh miik. eggs,
butter and vegetables and raising
money to buy the other necessary ar
ticles and to pay the two men whom
we kept at the ferry nil night to look
after sick and straggling soldiers. The
generous response made by our Oak
land people to every call for material
assistance is too well known to require
comment.
It is not necessary to speak here at |
length of our Convalescent Soldiers' j
Home, where we have cared for so
many. Organized soon after the begin
ning of the war. it was never empty
until its closing last wo"k, and the good
done through Its instrumentality can
not br- overestimated. The grateful let
ters which have come, and are still
constantly coming, to us attest this
fact.
I am proud of the work done by the
ladies on this side of the bay and wish
here publicly to thank all those who
labored with me in the good cause,
those who gave their time, those who
gave their money and those who gave
both to cheer, comfort and assistance
to our brave soldiers in their hours of
need.
Not long after that Miss Could re
ceived a letter asking her to join, urg
ing upon her the fact that I had al
ready done so.
After war was proclaimed and the
need of such an organization became
more apparent, a board of directors was
chosen, consisting of the following la
dies as officers:
Mrs. Ellen Hardin Walworth, direc
tor general; Mrs. Daniel Butterfield,
chairman; Mrs. Russell Sage, vice
chairman; Mrs. McLean, corresponding
secretary; Miss Anne Rhoades, record
ing secretary; Mrs. Raymond, treas
urer.
Funds poured in upon us, contribu
tions and donations, until our ex
chequer was a full one. There was no
particular system at that time. The
war relief women were all enthusiastic
and working themselves to death, but
without any business detail or sys
tematized routine of work. Into this
breach stepped Miss Helen Gould.
She wrote a letter inquiring as to the
disposition nf the funds. She perceived
that a head was needed, and, never tak
ing unto herself tho credit for the exe
cutive ability which she so distinctly
inherits from her father, in her quiet,
unobtrusive way, she set to work to
bring order out of chaos.

Miss Helen Gould's executive ability
put the v.ar re! iff in shape. She not
only gave her money, which to her was
a bagatelle, but she gave her time, her
strength, and bent every energy of her
mind to the duty which she saw b-fore
liÂ« p.
When the soldiers were being sent
home from Santiago Miss Gould made
a personal supervision of all th? hos
pitals on Ptaten Island, on Governors
Island, at Fort Hamilton, in Brooklyn
and in New York City. No detail was
too small or too Insignificant for her
personal supervision, and a want once

Modest Summary of the WorK Accomplished. ;
By Miss Heleo Gould.
Acting Dre^tor Gensral of trn Women's National War Relief Association.
IN response to your request that I
give you a report of the work of
the Women's National War Relief
Association, I would refer you to Mrs.
Walworth, the director general of our
society, who is familiar with the details
and who worked untiredly through the
summer and autumn. Her daughter's
life was siven in tho cause, for she con
tracted the fever while nursing in the
detention hospital at Montauk, and she
died soon after.
All American women seem to have
considered it a privilege to .do what
they could to show their affection foi
their country in the emergency that
arose, and in many instances it has
been touching to watch the enthusiasm
and energy with which they worked.
Eastern Appreciation of Our Women's WorK-
By Mrs. John F- Merrill,
President of the San Francisco Red Cross Society.
THE work done during this past
summer by our San Francisco
women has been in every way cred
itable. Without going into details,
which our public reports have made
common property, 1 feel that I have
every cause to congratulate most
warmly the members of our local or
ganization upon what they have ac
complished since they began their pa
triotic labors.
Believing as I do that no body of
women did more or better work for our
country's defenders than was done here
on this coast, it has been a very great
and special pleasure to me during my
recent trip East to see how widely rec
ognized is this fact in our sister States.
In every one of the thirty cities in
which I made a brief stay, praises for
our Red Cross work were to be heard
on every side. Miss Clara Barton,
whom I visited at her home in Glen
Echo, Maryland, expressed herself most
enthusiastically concerning it, and
whenever I was in any city from which
soldiers had been sent here, I, as our
Red Cross representative, was almost
overwhelmed with the heartfelt grati
tude expressed by all whom I met.' My
reception by the Cuban Relief Commit
When the camp was opened at Mon
tauk Miss Gould left the city for Camp
Wikoff, returning to the city at 2
o'clock in the morning of the following
day. For days she investigated all the
needs and requirements of the men and
established a diet kitchen at her own
expense.
Her home at Irvington was, literally
speaking, turned over to the soldiers.
It is needless to speak of what she did
for the sick soldiers in the hospitals at
Ynnkers, the cottages at Irvington and
Tarrytown, and no one save one who
knew her as intimately and loved her
as dearly as I do has any idea of tho
strength and energy she expended in
giving, doing and organizing.
In actual money, I am sure she gave
more than $30,000 to the war relief fund,
besides the $100,000 which she gave to
the Government at the beginning of the
war.
I can only say in closing this
record of the Woman's National War
Relief, which is really synonymous with
Helen Gould:
"That God has given her his Holy
Spirit, and through her flows his bene
ficence to all mankind."
One of our neighbors and her daugh
ters worked for months as hard as
though they were working for a liveli
hood. They distributed garments for
both the Red Cross Society and our
own; their barn was used as a work
shop through the summer, and the wo
men and young village girls spent many
hours in sewing under their direction,
as well as taking garments home. It
was touching to see women with large
families of children, and with husbands
on small salaries, who still found time
to do a great amount of this work.
The experience of the last few
months, where people from all over the
country have united in giving their
time, money and services for a common
cause, makes us feel more strongly
than ever that we are a nation and not
simply a loose federation of States.
â¢
tee is also one of the exceptionally
pleasant memories left by my trip
We are Inclined to feel sometimes,
here in California, that we are some
what isolated and are working alone
as it were, but my visit East this time
has for me destroyed all this impression
forever. I realize now that we Callfor
nians are part of a great whole, bound
together by ties of warmest affection
and truest sympathy.
I think that the work for the sol
diers which was done on the coast this
summer has not only helped them, but
has helped all the .workers. It has
made them more patriotic, more con
siderate and more unselfish, and has
created between the hundreds of men
and women who were for a time united
In earnest labor for a noble cause a
bond of sympathy that cannot readily
be broken.
Until the reign of the Empress Jose
phine a handerehief was thought In
France so shocking an object that a lady
would never have dared to use It before
any one. The word, even, was carefully
avoided In refined conversation. An actor
who would have used a handkerchief on
the stage, even In the most tearful mo
ments of the play, would have been un
mercifully hissed; and It .was only in the
19
beginning of the present century that a
celebrated actress, Mile. Duehesnois.
dared to appear with a handerchief in her
hand. Having to speak of this handker
chief in the course of the piece, she never
could summon enough courage to call it
by its true name, but referred to it as "a
light tissue."
The Oldest Emigrant to California.
ON a beautiful ranch, three miles
from Santa Rosa, lives one of the
daintiest and sweetest little old
women that ever was seen. True,
her complexion is not quite as fair and
smooth as it was eighty years ago. nor
her kindly eyes quite as bright, but
her laugh is just as merry, and her
heart just as light and happy, and her
daughter. Mrs. Hyers, the dear, digni
fied elderly lady with whom she makes
her home, calls her, and with good rea
son, "the sunshine of the house."
Just 102 years and seven months aero
a pretty little baby girl was born to
Mr?. Mellissa M. Myers of St. Lawrence
County, in the State of Now York, and
this little baby girl has lived on and
on until now, when she has seen over
V j years and a half more than a cen
tury of existence, and is looking for
ward to passing at lea t several years
more under our pleasant California
skies.
Little Mary Myers grew up to be a
very comely young woman, well versed
in the ways of good housekeepers, and
when the hour and the man arrived she
married a clever young fellow named
Dv Plaunty, and made the pleasantest
kind of a home for him and the little
ones who came afterward.
After Mr. Dv Plaunty's death his
widow made a brav.^ li^ht for some
time to care for herself and her chil
dren alone, but after a time made a
second, and very happy, marriage with
a Mr. Stuart, whose widow she now is.
Mrs. Stuart has been the mother of
a large family, five members of which
were sons. Two of her boys she gave
to her country in its hour of need thir
ty-seven years ago, and though she
gave them with loyal willingness she
has never yet ceased, in her mother
heart, to mourn their loss. One died
at Memphis, and the otner In Anderson
ville and the mention of either place,
or of them, still brings tears to the eyes
that watched the boys march away
nearly forty years since.
Mrs. Stuart's claim to public interest
lies not alone in the fact of her ad
vanced age, but to her belongs the dis
tinction of being undoubtedly the old
est person who ever emigrated to our
hospitable State. Last spring, wh^n
she lacked only six weeks of being 102
years old, Mrs. Stuart started from her
home of many years in Penamo, Mo..
eighty miles south of Kansas City, and
came straight through to San Francis
co. She is delighted with California, its
climate and the conditions which sur
round her here, and only regrets that
she did not make the trip earlier
in life. "My mother lived to be 104."
she says, "away back there in the
freezing East; if she had come here she
might have lived years longer. I feel
now as if I might live to be at least
110." And all her many friends hope
that she may.
Wire pence Telephones.
Telephonic communication has beon ef
fected between a number of farms in
Australia by means of wire fences. The
Australian Agriculturist publishes a note
from a coYrespondent writing from a sta
tion near Cobar, stating that it was easy
to converse with friends at a station
eight miles distant with instruments con
nected on the wire fences, and the same
kind of communication was established
over a distance of thirteen miles. A large
number of stations are connected in this
way, and the system, if widely adopted,
will do mtirh to relieve the monotony of
back-country life.20

Assistance of the Press.
As far back as the murder of Lord Wil
liam Russell by Courvoisier the publica
tion of the story in the press led to the
first dew to the murderer. Mine. Paoline,
tel-keeper, read the story of his ar
ind recognized him as the man who

other articles of value. The police Iden
tified the whole as part of the. property
abstracted from Lord William Russell's.
Hitherto the evidence had been mainly
circumstantial, but here was a link that
directly connected Courvoisier with the
murder, and eventually led to his capture
and execution.
The famous murder of Mr. Briggs in
the compartment Â«>f a London bound
train, which convulsed all England in the
year l^T, furnishes another Instance of
the value of newspaper publication. The
chief clew was a Jiat found in the com
partment, which bore the maker's name.
inside the cover. A cabman who read
Vthis fact in a newspaper at once came
forward with the information that he
lind bought that hat at that maker's for
a German named Franc Muller, a former
lodger of his. Muller had given his little
daughter a jeweler's cardboard box bear
ing the curiously ominous name of
"Death, CheapÃide." Now, Mr. Death had
already produced the murdered man's
goM chain, which he said had been dis
posed of to him by a man whom he be
lieved to be a German. There could now
bfÂ» little doubt that Muller was the mur
derer. His movements were readily
traced. He had started for America in a
Bailing vessel and was easily forestalled
by a fast Atlantic liner, which carried the
detective officers, the jeweler and the
cabman.
Trifles as Clews.
The smallest thing has often sufficed to
establish a clew. Four letters, half a word
scratched upon a chisel, have led to the
Identification of its guilty owner. A but
ton dropped after a burglary has been
found to correspond with those of a man
in custody fur another nffense, and the
evidence has been clinched by the f.ict
that his coat lacked a button.
In the famous Gervais case, in France,
proof depended greatly upon the date
when the roof of a cellar had been dis
turbed. This was shown to have been ne
cessarily some time before, for in the in
terval the cochineal Insects had laid
their eggs, which they only do at a par
ticular season.
The Ineffaceable odor of musk and other
Strong perfumes has more than once
brought home robbery and murder to
their perpetrators. An interesting oase is
recorded in India, where in the plunder of
a native banker an entire pot of musk,
exactly as it had been cut from the deer,
was carried off with a number of val
uables. Musk is rare and costly, being
obtained generally from far off" Thibet.
The police, in following up a band of da
colts, Invaded their tanda and were at
once conscious of an unmistakable and
overpowering smell of musk, which was
presently our up with a number of coins
of an uncommon currency, that were
identified by t-e banker.
The Murder in the Hue Mazarin.
For close, hard, logical deductions from
small indications, growing gradually into
strong surmise and then into a certainty,
the Frenchman Mace's detection of the
famous murderer in the Rue Mazarin Is
better than anything ever invented by
Gaboriau. On a January afternoon a ser
geant de vllle hurrying home after being
relieved from duty, was stopped by the
owner of a small restaurant in the Rue
Princess with a horrible story. From the
depths of the well in his courtyard he had
fished up a package containing a human
leg in an advanced stage of decomposi
tion. The commissary of the quarter. M.
Gustave Mace, then a young man on the
threshold of a distinguished detective ca
reer, was summoned to the spot. He made
a close investigation of the well and suc
ceeded in fishing up another parcel. The
cover was a black glazed calico. Each
end was simply knotted, but the middle
was sewed with black thread. The re
moval of this exterior covering revealed
another covering made of a qart of a
trousers leg In iron gray cloth. Inside of
all was another human leg. I>lke the oth
er, which was probably its fellow, It was
thin and shrunken and with little calf to
it. There was only one telltale indication
part of a sock bearing the initial "B. "
with a simple cross on each side of it,
thus:
x B. x
Now. ... _.y a week or two previous a hu
man thigh bone had been picked up in
the Rue Jacob. Subsequently a few mor
sels of human flesh had been fished out
of the Seine and the Saint Martin Ctanal.
Other Fragments Found.
The popular excitement ran wila when
the officials of the Morgue reported that
just before Christmas a human thigh,
wrapped up in a common blue knitted
shawl and bearing traces of having been
only a few days in the water, had been
deposited In the mortuary chamber. Then
the proprietor of a riverside laundry
near the Quay Valmy came forward with
a story of how about midnight on Decem
ber 19 he had happened upon a short man
In a long coat and tall hat industriously
engaged in throwing or scattering some
thing in the river by handfuls. They
looked like scraps of meat. When inter
rogated he had laughingly replied, "I am
a keen fisherman. To-morrow is a holi
day. I am baiting the river for a big
day's sport."
Now this date, the 19th, was just two
days later than the discovery of the thigh
tied up in the old shawl. Everything
pointed to a cold-blooded crime, and one
of a ghastly nature. Dr. Tardieu of the
Morgue decided that the legs were those
of a man advanced in years. A clearly
marked scar, only recently healed, was
found on one leg. Another fact had been
shrewdly and quickly verified by Mace.
The elased Calico cover, the peculiarly
knotted ends, the stitching with black
cottonâ all these seemed to tiim the handi
work of a tailor. From the concierge he
dr^w out the fact that a young seam
stress, Mlie. Dard, had recently given up
her apartment in the house, and that
among her visitors was tailor who
brought her occasional work and who
used to carry up water from her from the
well.
Voirbo, the Tailor.
Through Mile. Dard herself it was sub
sequently learned that the name of the
water-carrying tailor was Voirbo. She
could not supply his address, as she had
not seen him since his marriage, a few
weeks previous. But she. unhesitatingly
gave all information that she could.
Amonp other facts Mace learned that
Voirbo'B only constant companion was a
man named Desire Bodasse. whose aunt,
Mme. Bodasse, was a bandage-maker,
living In the Rue de Mesles. The bandage
maker when interviewed, described her
nephew as a tapestry worker who had
saved money, but who was eccentric and
miserly. She had not seen him for a
whole "month, but she was not anxious,
for he had often disappeared for weeks.
The last time she had seen him was on
Sunday, December 13, with his friend,
Voirbo.
"Please describe Voirbo."
"He is short, and generally wears a long
overcoat and tall hat."
For the first time the scent was begin
ning to grow warm. Voirbo's trade and
his intimacy with the old man whose
name began with the initial "B" were
good starting points. Mme. Bodasse was
driven over U> tfie Morgue. She identi
fied all the fragments of clothing as hav
ing belonged to her nephew. She herself
had marked the socks with the "B" be
tween the two crosses. As to the scar on
the leg, she remembered that her nephew
had cut himself badly by falling on the
sharp edge of a broken bottle.
Voirbo and Bodasse.
Mace traced Voirbo from his old address
in the Rue Mnzarin to a now one In the
Rue de la Martin. From a woman who
cleanrd Voirbo's apartment more particu
lars were gleanod. She spoke of his in
timacy with Desire Bodasse and ex
pressed her surprise that the latter had
not been present at Voirbo's marriage.
Voirbo himself had appeared much an
noyed at this.
"I wished him to be my principal wit
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAKL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 29, 1899.
ness," he had been heard to say, but
he has chosen to go off on a long Journey
the very day before the ceremony.'
There were differences between them In
epite of their intimacy. Voirbo hated
Kodasse for his avarictousness. He had
begged his friend to help forward his
marriage by a loan of 10,000 francs, but
the miser had refused. Here was a mo
tive for the crime if Hodasse was really
the victim. But Bodasse's apartmentstn
the Rue Mazarin were fast locked. The
concierge explained that he frequently
lacked himself up for days or, even week*
"There Was an Immediate Change in Voirbo's Derrjeanor. Terror Seized Him- He
Could Hardly Keep H is Seat, He Clinched His Hands, His Face Grew Ashy Pale,
and His Staring Eyes, Fixed Upon tfoe Water-Jug, Followed Every Movement
of M. Mace's Hand 1 ."
at a time. She was pure that, he was at
home, as she had heard movements and
seen lights in the windows during the last
six weeks. Mace decided to force the
lock. The place was in perfect order, but
there was a slight layer of dust on the
furniture. The i*ed had not been slept In.
On the floor above the fireplace were the
remains of seventeen lucifer matches.
Above on the mantelpiece were two paper
candle boxes, one empty, the pther con
taining a single candle. These boxes were
of the kind that hold eight candles each.
Jt would appear, therefore, that fifteen
had been burned. As two of the matches
had missed fire, this exactly corresponded
with the number of burnt matches on the
floor. In fact, the concierge declared that
she had noticed a light in the room Just
fifteen times during the previous six
weeks.
Who Was the VisitorP
Some one had evidently come there on
purposeâ that some one was probably not
Bodaf.se. The suspicion was increased
by the fact that a one-day clock was go
ing with a regular tick. tick. Bodarse's
hatâ the only one be ownedâ his favorite
walking stick and a large silver watch
and chain, without which he never left
the house, were found in the room. But
a green pocketbook. in which Mme. Bo
dasse declared that he kept all his valu
ables, and of whose secret hiding place
she was aware, had disappeared. A
scrap of pink paper, however, was found
by M. Mace inside the watch. This con
tained a long list of numbers of securi
ties In Italian Government stock of the is
sue of 1861, all payable to bearer. In the
hopes that the mysterious visitor to the
rooms might be caught on his next call,
M. Mace organized a close watch and
concealed two officers in an alcove of the
principal room. But unfortunately they
nad not been warned to look out for
Yoirbo, whom they knew, and being fat
witted folk, they actually informed him of
their surveillance.
Thus he was put upon his guard. Foil
ed In this part of his scheme. Mace
prosecuted his investigations into the
character of the man. At the Rue Maz
arin he learned that Volrbo, before leav
ing his ay>artmentÃ had paid his rent with
a five hundred franc share of Italian
stock of ]S6l. which corresponded with one
of the missing numbers.
Another Compromising Bevelation.
Voirbo'a old servant revealed another
suspicious fact. On arriving- for work
quite early on the morning of December
17 she had found her master already up
and dressed and the room swept out ana
garnished. It was not like Voirbo to do
his own cleaning. More, he had actually
taken pains to wash the floor. A part of
the tiles were still wet and shiny. Then
came another still more damaging reve
lation. The missing stocks were found in
the new apartments to which he had re
moved on his marriage. - v
â¢ Voirbo was, arrested. btlJfl&c&xoQlsL him
to his old lodgings in the Rue : Mazarln.
He betrayed no anxiety, believing prob
ably that he had left no traces of his
crime.
And now followed an extraordinary
coupâ one of the most brilliant bits of
detective sagacity known to criminal an
nals.
A Brilliant Coup.
M. Mace had been struck on his first
survey of the apartment with a certain
peculiarity in the room. The tiled floor
sloped downward from the window to
ward the bed in the recess.
He had also realized from the quantity
and position of the furniture in Voirbo's
time that the only part of the room in
which there was room to move freely was
ifround a. circular table which had occu
pied the center. He concluded therefore
that if the murder had been committed
there it must have been near that table,
and further, that probably the dismem
berment had been performed upon it.
Then, taking up a jug full of water,
said aloud:
"I notice a slope on the floor. Now, if
a body was cut up on this table the effu
sion of blood would have been great, and
the fluid must have followed this slope.
Any other lluid thrown down here must
follow the same direction. I will empty
this jug upon the floor, and we will see
what happens."
There was an immediate change in Voir
bo's demeanor. Terror seized him. He
could hardly keep his seat, he clinched his
hands, his face grew ashy pale, and his
staring eyes, fixed upon the water-jug,
followed every movement of M. Mace s
hand.
The water flowed straight toward the
bed and collected beneath it in two
great pools. The exact spot thus indi
cated was carefully sponged dry, and a
mason summoned to take up the tiles of
the floor.
A quantity of dark stuff, presumably
dried blood, was found below. The infer
ence was obvious. The blood had flowed
from the body and percolated the inter
stices of the tiles, thus evading the wash
ing of the floor and proving the in
completeness of Voirbo's precautions.
This terrible discovery effected in his
own presence finished Volrbo. Then and
there he made a full confession of the
crime.
Voirbo's Confession.
He had frequently begged of Bodasse
to lend him 10.000 francs to help him to
his marriage, but the miser had refused
DyfIIAjQRARJtiUR
GRIFFITHS
steadily, so Volrbo resolved to kill and
despoil him.
The victim came unsuspectingly to his
friend's rooms and was taken from be
hind near the round table. A single blow
from a heavy flatlron had stunned him,
but the deed was not completed until
the throat had been cut from ear to ear.
Then the corpse had been dismembered
and the fragments gradually disposed of.
Molten lead had been poured into the
mouth and ears of the head, which, thus
weighted, had been Bunk in the Seine.
The murderer, like our own Martin Thorn,
knew that the head was the part most
recognizable and most valuable In estab
lishing the identity of the victim. It will
be seen, indeed, that in many ways this
crime resembles the Guldensuppe murder,
but the story of its detection is infinitely
roller of ingenious subtleties of infer
ence and deduction. Indeed, It Is the
most thoroughly representative story In
the criminal annals of France.
Volrbo foiled justice in the end. He
committed suicide almost immediately on
his reception at Mazas, the great cellular
prison of Paris. He was waiting his turn
to be inscribed on the prison register,
when he tore open a long loaf he was
carrying under his arm, took out a razor
blade and quickly cut his throat.
Tact and Promptitude.
The French detective often shows great
tact and promptitude. One of them one
day recognized a face without being able
to put a name to it, and followed his man
into a bus. "Don't arrest me here," said
the other. "I'll come with you quietly
when we leave the omnibus." It proved
to be a prisoner who had escaped that
very morning from the Prefecture whom
the police officer had only seen for a mo
ment in the passage. Perpetual suspicion
becomes second nature with the detec
tive; he has to be constantly on the alert,
his imagination active; he must readily
invent tricks and dodges when the occa
sion demands. There is a positive order
that an arrest must be made quietly, if
possible unobserved, and not in any cafe,
theater or public place. This obliges him
to have recourse to artifice to entrap his
prey. Fortunately, most criminals are
simplicity Itself, and readily give them
selves away. It is enough to send a mes
sage for the man wanted and he â¢will ap
pear at the wineshop around the corner,
bringing, say, his tools to do some Imag
inary Job.
Stupidity of Criminals.
Criminals continually "give themselves
away" by their own carelessness, their
stupid, incautious behavior. It is almost
an axiom in detective work to watch the
scene of a crime for the visit of a crimi
nal. He seems. drawn thither by an irre
sistible Impulse. The same impulse at
tracts the French murderer to the
Morgue, where his victim lies in full pub
lic view. This is so thoroughly under
stood In Paris that the police station of
ficers in plain clothes are always
among the crowd ever filing past
the plate glass windows that sep
arate the public from the marble
slopes on which the bodies are exposed.
Numerous instances might be quoted in
which an offender betrays his crime by
ill-advised ostentation, the reckless dis
play or expenditure of money after a pe
riod of known poverty, the parading
around in the clothes or the Jewelry of
the murdered. A curious instance of the
neglect of ordinary precaution was that
of Wainwright, the murderer of Hannah
Urown, who left the corpus delicti, the
damning proof of his guilt, to the prying
curiosity of an outsider, while he went off
in search of a cab.
Poisoners have repeatedly betrayed
themselves by their avowed study of
toxicology. One, a doctor, Castaing, ex
perimented on animals and kept a care
rul record of the effect of the poison he
administered to his victims. The
Marchioness of Brlnvilliers, while await
ing trial, wrote a minute and detailed ac
count of her crimes. The poisoner Cas
truccio kept a careful record in his diary
of the occasions on which he gave arsenic,
and one of the facts brought against him
was a demand for work on poisons pre
sented at a public library and signed in
bis own handwriting. The Spanish pois
oner Vlllamayor, who destroyed a whole
family, laughed openly at the doctors
when they ignored the real symptoms and
treated for gastritis the victims who were
dying of poison.
Ellison, the Bodmln murderer, went the
very morning after the deed to have his
hair and whiskers trimmed at the local
barber's. The hairdresser noticed that his
hair was ragged and that his beard was
brown, while the hair on his head was
fray. The murdered woman was found
o have a handful of brown hair in one
tightly clenched hand, and of gray in the
other. They had evidently been torn out
in the fierce struggle for life, and they
were positively identified as similar to
those which had been cut and trimmed.
Excess of Caution.
The murderer's stupidity is sometimes
as clearly shown in the excess of precau
tion as in the want of it. Troppmann, the
youth of 19 who slaughtered a whole fam
ily, and whose intelligence was of such
a high order that the prison chaplain
called him a genius, was yet foolish
enough to make a drawing, or
plan, explaining exactly how tne
murder was committed by Kinck,
whom Troppmann accused of the murder.
He described the scene of the crime so ac
curately that it was concluded he must
have been there himself, and thus
Btrengthened the suspicion against him.
The suggestion that death has been
caused by suicide is often attempted, but
in a fashion that provides its own de
nial.
The fact of the knife or weapon being
held loosely must generally defeat the
object of the murderer who places it in
the victim's hand. As a rule, the weapon
after suicide is tightly grasped. The force
necessary for the act is continued, and
passes into what doctors call the "cadav
eric spasm"; the hand becomes rigid, the
hold contracted and clenched. Doctors
are not quite agreed whether the mur
derer can or cannot create this effect.
Many affirm that the hand of a dead per
eon while still warm is pliant and cannot
be made to grasp anything so tightly as
the muscular contraction which comes on
at the last moment of life. On the other
hand, it has been shown that if the
weapon is held long enough and the fin
gers have been pressed around the imple
ment, it becomes more or less fixed when
the second stage, that of rigidity, is
reached.
Jack the Ripper.
The outside public may think that the
identity of "Jack the Kipper" was never
revealed. Major Griffiths acknowledges
that so far as actual knowledge goes, this
is undoubtedly true. But the police, after
the last murder, had brought their inves
tigations to the point of strongly suspect
ing several persons, all of them known to
be homicidal lunatics, and against three
of these they held very plausible and rea
sonable grounds of suspicion. Concern
ing two of them the case was weak, al
though it was based on certain colorable
facts. One was a Polish Jew, a known
lunatic, who was at large in the district
of Whltechapel at the time of the njurtlers
and who, having afterward developed
homicidal tendencies, was confined in an
asylum. This man was said to resemble
the murderer by the one person who got
a glimpse of himâ the police constable in
Mitre Court. The second possible crimi
nal was a Russian doctor, also insane,
who had been a convict both in England
and Siberia. This man was in the habit
of carrying about surgical knives and in
struments in his pockets; his antecedents
were of the very worst, and at the time â 
of the Whitechapel murders he was in
hiding, or at least his whereabouts was
never exactly known.
The Probable Culprit.
The third person was of the same type,
but the suspicion in his case was stronger
and there was every reason to believe
that his own friends entertained grave
doubts about him. He was also a doctor
in the prime of life, and believed to be
Insane or on the borderland of insanity,
who disappeared immediately after the
last murder, that in Miller's court, on the
9th of November, 1888. On the last day
of that year, seven weeks later, his body
was found floating in the Thames, and
was said to have been in the water &
month. The theory in this case was that
after his last exploit, which was the most
fiendish of all, his brain entirely gave way
and he became furiously insane and com
mitted suicide. It is at least a strong pre
sumption that "Jack the Ripper" died or
was put under restraint after the Miller's
court affair, which ended this series of
crimes. It would be interesting to know
whether in this third case the man was
left-handed or ambidextrous both sug
gestions having been advanced by medical
experts after viewing the victims. Cer
tain other doctors disagreed on this
point, which may be said to add another
to the many instances in which medical
evidence has been conflicting, not to say
confusing.
Yet the incontestable fact remains, un
satisfactory and disquieting, that many
murder mysteries have baffled all in
quiry and that the long list of undiscov
ered crimes continually receives many
mysterious additions. An erroneous im
pression, however, prevails that such fail
ures are more common in Anglo-Saxon
countries than elsewhere. No doubt our
police are greatly handicapped by the
law's limitations, which act always in
protecting the accused. But with all their
advantages and the power to make ar
rests on suspicion, to interrogate the ac
cused parties and force on self-incrimlna
tion, tne police of Continental Europe
meet with many rebuffs. Numbers of
cases are "classed," as it is officially
called In Paris, put by, pigeonholed for
ever and a day, wanting sufficient proofs
for trial, in the utter absence, indeed, of
any suspected person to try. In every
country and at all times, past and present,
there have been crimes that defied de
tection.
Secret Poisoning.
It is generally held that secret poison
ing has much diminished in these later
days, and no doubt the law, assisted by
science, affords better protection to the
general public nowadays. We are now
closely safeguarded by the regulations
that govern the sale of poisons; science
has a deeper insight into the properties
of lethal drugs and better aids detection
by improved methods of analysis ajnd a
readier, more positive recognition of the
traces and effects of poison. Again, the
Btringent and precise rules in force aa to
death certificates, the law that the cause
of death must be in all cases attested by
a properly qualified medical practitioner.
Is a great guarantee, although, as we
shall see, its value may be diminished
under new conditions of interment.
A chief obstacle no fioubt to a free, un
lawful use of poison is the difficulty of
access to the person threatened. Now
and again the reckless homicide, who kllli
for mere pleasure of it, casts his or her
poisonous net over a whole circle, some
family, some gathering of people, by the
casual distribution of poisoned food,
cakes, confectionery and so forth, to take
effect as it may. But if there is a definite,
deliberate intention to murder a particu
lar victim, facility of access is a first,
indispensable condition. As a natural
consequence the use of poison is very
largely limited to particular agents, who
enjoy special advantages of time and
place, to women and doctors, in short,
whose ways of life bring them into daily
contact with those they have marked
down. It will be found that this is al
most a general law. The most notorious
poisoners of modern time have been mem
bers of the medical profession, chemists
and females, whether wives, nurses, com
panions, cooks or servants, intimately as
sociated with others by natural, family
or domestic ties. American statistics show
that some five-eighths of female homi
cides by poison in the United States were
in personal serviceâ housewives, house
keepers, servants, washerwomen and
Does Science Aid the Criminals P
An uncomfortable feeling prevails that
modern science is not altogether on tne
side of defense. It may assist detedtlon,
yet it has multiplied the methods of pois
oning by many chemical and other dis
coveries. Some of the newer processes fa
vor the criminal; many products, animal,
vegetable and mineral, are available
which leave little or no trace if cau
tiously administered. Improved knowl
edge, again, has developed the practice
of chronic or gradual poisoning, of sap
ping life by small deleterious doses that
eventually cause death, but only after
simulating the symptoms of natural dis
ease.
Sir Henry Thompson, in the spring of
last year, when engaged in a controversy
as regards cremation and its possible ef
fects in encouraging crime, strongly
urged the appointment of a special expert
medical officer to examine all bodies be
fore they are disposed of for cremation.
He believed that in the future . "easily
decomposed compounds are likely to be
used, the existence of which it is difficult
if not impossible to verify after two or
three days." Can it be that the present
infrequency of criminal poisoning, as
evinced by the daily records, is
due to the employment of these safer
lethal substances to which Sir Henry
Thompson refers? An uncomfortable
feeling has been aroused by the out
spoken evidence of another eminent med
ical man. Sir J. Crichton Brown at a
public lecture stated explicitly there were
organic poisons well known to experts
which could be used with impunity with
out the slightest fear of detection. "A
connoisseur in poisons could, by keeping
microbes," he explained, ''slaughter hun
dreds of innocent persons without the
slightest fear of his crime coming to
light." He, however, qualified this
sweeping assertion by stating his belief
that these poisons, in his wide experience,
were rarely, if ever, illegitimately used.
The stories about Frenchmen eating
snails are believed by many people to
have no foundation in fact, but snails
are eaten and to a very considerable
extent in France. Nearly 100,000 pounds'
weight of snails Is sold dally in the
Paris market, to be eaten by dwellers
in that city. They are carefully reared
for the purpose in extensive snail gar
dens in the provinces and fed on aro
matic herbs to give them a fine flavor.
One such garden in Dijon is said to
bring in to its proprietor several thou
sand francs a year.
Many Swiss cantons contain largre
snail gardens, where they are reared
with great pains. They are not only
regarded as a great delicacy, but are
considered very nutritious. Hygienista
state that they contain 17 per cent of
nitrogenous matter and that they are
equal to oysters in nutritive properties.
Snails are also extensively used as
an article of food in Austria, Spain,
Italy and Egypt and the countries on
the African side of the Mediterranean.
Indeed the habit of eating snails as
food has existed in various parts of
Europe for many centuries.MAKING A

ANTI-IMPERIALISM: BY DAVID STARR JORDAN.
CAST May I spoke before my peo
ple at home on the subject of
Imperialism. I took my title, as
I take now my text, from Kip
ling's "Recessional," the noblest
hymn of our century: "Lest we
forget." For It seemed to me then,
Just after the battle of Manila, that
we might forget who we are and what
we stand for. In the sudden intoxica
tion of far-off victory, with the con
sciousness of power and courage, with
the feeling that all the world is talking
of us, our great stern mother patting
us on the back, and all the lesser peo
ples looking on in fear or envy, we
might lose our heads.
But greater glory than this has been
ours before. For more than a century
our nation has stood for something
higher and nobler than success in war,
something not enhanced by a victory
at sea, or a wild, bold charge over a hill
lined with ma; ed batteries. We have
stood for civic ideals, and the greatest
of these, that government should make
men by giving them freedom to make
themselves. The glory of the American
republic is that it is the embodiment
of American manhood. It was the
dream of the fathers that this should
always be so â that American govern
ment and republican manhood should
be coextensive, that the nation shall
not go where freedom cannot go.
Colonial expansion Is not national
growth. By the spirit of our constitu
tion our nation can expand only with
the growth of freedom. It is composed
not of land but of men. It Is a self
governing people, gathered in self-gov
erning United States. There is no ob
jection to national expansion where
honorably brought about. If there were
any more space to be occupied by
American citizens, who could take care
of themselves, we would cheerfully
overflow and fill it. But colonial ag
grandizement Is not national expan
sion; slaves are not men. Wherever
degenerate, dependent or alien races
are within our borders to-day, they are
not part of the United States. They
constitute a social problem; a menace
to peace and welfare. There is no solu
tion of race problem or class problem
until race or class can solve it for itself.
Unless the negro can make a man of
himself through the agencies of free
dom, free ballot, free schools, free re
ligions, there can be no solution of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 29, 1899.
It was yonder," he said, pointing* to a
group of buildings, "that Jean Gobelin, in
the days of the middle ages, establish* 1
an institution for dyeing. The scarlet that
he produced was the most wonderful that
the world had ever seen. In fact, men
had never known the real beauty of scar
let before the days of Jean Gobelin, and
the secret was in the waters of the
Bievre."
"So this muddy little stream possesses
magical qualities for turning things red.
Its appearance is certainly deceptive. It
looks as though it could only turn things
brown."
"Yes. it is crown nowadays," said the
old man. "It has lost much of Its magic.
The new generations have invented other
processes of dyeing, and we do not need
the Bievre, but truly we are indebted to
this little river for the first Gobelin tapes
tries. Had it not been for the beauty and
durability of the coloring which Jean
Gobelin produced, the idea of makingthese
beautiful pictures in wool would never
have been born. There are people nowa
days who declare that the Bievre never
possessed this quality; that it is all a
played-out tradition, but I know that it is
true. 1 had it from my grandfather, who
learned it from his grandfather."
"And the tapestries are manufactured
race problem. Already Booker Wash
ington warns us that this problem un
settled Is a national danger greater
than the attack of armies within or
without. The race problems of the
tropics are perennial and insoluble, for
free institutions cannot exist where free
men cannot live.
The territorial expansion now con
templated would not extend our institu
tions, because the proposed colonies are
incapable of civilized self-government.
It would not extend our nation, because
these regions are already full of alien
races, and are not habitable by Anglo-
Saxon people. The strength of Anglo-
Saxon civilization lies in the mental
and physical activity of men and in thÂ»:
growth of the home. Where activity is
fatal to life, the Anglo-Saxon decays,
mentally, morally, physically. The
home cannot endure In the climate of
the tropics. Mr. Ingersoll once said
that if a colony of New England
preachers and Yankee schoolma'ams
were established in the West Indies the
third generation would be seen riding
bareback on Sunday to the cock-fights.
Civilization Is, as it were, suffocated in
the tropics. It lives, as Benjamin Kidd
suggests, as though under deficiency of
oxygen. The only American who can
live in the tropics without demoraliza
tion is the one who has duties at home
and will never go there.
The freedom of Spanish America Is
for the most part miiltary despotism.
It Is said of the government of Russia
that it is "despotism tempered by as
sassination." That of most of our sis
ter republics is assassination tempered
by despotism. Mexico, the best of them,
is not a republic; it is a despotism, the
splendid tyranny of a man strong and
wise, who knows Mexico and how to
govern her, a humane and beneficent
tyrant.
We shall find in Cuba all the prob
lems that vex Latin America. There
are three things inseparable from the
life of the Cuban people â the cigarette,

These stand for vice, superstition and

We are pledged to give self-govern
ment to Cuba. This we cannot do in
full without the risk of seeing it re
lapse Into an anarchy as repulsive, if
not as hopeless, as the tyranny of
Spain. Only the splendid apparition of

to an end. The dictator may bring law,
but not democracy. Its ultimate fate

the group of buildings. "I have intended
for a long time to visit this institution
If I may enter I shall go to-day."
"Yes, this Is Saturday. It is open to
day to the public. If you hurry you will
yet have time to see a good deal," he
said, leaning forward to look at the clock
of the brasserie.
"Very well, I will go, but first tell me
if there are other families* who have been
employes at this occupation throughout
generattons. Is your case a- uniqij'lft one?"
"Ah. no, my lady." he answered, "there
are families who have been making Gobe
lin tnpestrlcs for a longer time than my
family. They count their connection with
the institution by cenuries. You know it
is a groat honor to be a Gobelin tapestry
worker. We do not receive very much
money for our labor, but when we are old
the Government gives us each a pension
and a house and garden and we pass our

has succeeded me and his son will suc

"You must be sure to look at the tapes
try they are making for the Czarina," he
said, after I had thanked him and had
started on my way.
With these words in my ears, naturally
the first thing that I sought was the
tapestry for the Czarina, which will be a
present from President Felix Faure. Two
years ago when the Czarina visited Paris
raved a beautiful picture of sweet
maternity that hung in the forsaken gal
tery ut Versailles. It was Mme. Lebrun's
portrait of Marie Antoinette and her
children. Herself a young mother and a
Queen, the picture is said to have touched
the Csarina to tears. What else could the
gallant French President do? He could not
Cuba, but not at once. We must take
our time, ami do it in decency and or
der, as we ha%"e taken Alaska and Ha
waii. We take Cuba, Porto Rico and
Hawaii, not because we want them, but
because we have no friends who can
manage them well and give us no
trouble, and it is possible that in a cen
tury or so they may become part of our
nation as well as of our territory.
American enterprise will ilow into Cu
ba, no doubt, when Cuba Is free. It will
clean up the cities, stamp out the
fevers, build roads where the trails for
mule sleds are, and railroads where the
current of traffic goes. Doubtless a
great industrial awakening will follow
our occupation of Cuba when we have
taken away the barrier of our tariffs.
The Anglo-Saxon nations have cer
tain ideals on which their political
superstructure rests. The great politi
cal service of England is to teach re
spect for law. The British empire rests
on British law. The great political
service of the United States is to teach
respect for the individual man. The
American republic rests on individual
manhood, the "right divine of man, the
million trained to be free." The chief
agency in the development of free man
hood is the recognition of the individual
man as the responsible unit of govern
ment. This recognition is not confined
to local and municipal affairs, as is
practically the case in England, but ex
tends to all branches of government.
It is the axiom of democracy that
"government must derive its Just pow
ers from the consent of the governed."
No such consent justifies slavery; hence
our Union "could not endure half slave,
half free." No such consent justifies
our hold on Alaska, Hawaii, Cuba,
Porto Rico, the Ladrones or the Philip
pines. The people do not want us, our
ways, our business, or our government.
It is said nowadays that wherever our
flag is raised it must never be hauled
down. To haul down an American flag
is an Insult to Old Glory. But this
patriotism rings counterfeit. It would
touch a truer note to say that wherever
our flag goes it shall bring good gov
ernment.
Take the Philippines or leave them!
No half-way measures can be perma
nent. To rule at arm's length is to fail
in government. These islands must be
long to the United States, or else they
must belong to the people who inhabit
them. If we govern the Philippines, so
in their degree must the Philippines
govern us.

ligently favor colonial extension to-day

give her the original; it was not his to
bestow, and so he promised her a copy of
the picture done in Gobelin tapestry.
The tapestry makers commenced the
work at once, and although four persons
have given their entir4 tlm<? t0 st since,
it is not yet more than half completed.
So beautiful is the tapestry even thus in
complete that one longs for a few Czar
ina tears, those that were sufficiently ef
fective to precipitate such a presentation.
If the tapestry can possibly be finished,
it Is expected that it' will be one of the
attractions of the exposition of 1900, where
it will be exhibited before its presenta
tion.
Can an artisan produce a work of art
is a question that naturally suggests it
self in watching the tapestry workers.
The tapestries are surely works of art,
the laborers as surely artisans, clever
and skillful in a remarkable degree but
not artists. Each worker fias his partic
ular corner, at which he stitches away
without the slightest attention to his
neighbor. He is seated always behind the
frame, the picture that is being copied be
hind him; .thus he does not see either
the model or the work that he is execut
ingâtwo inconveniences which there
seems to be no way of rectifying.
In the olden times the cleverest workers
were employed exclusively on the faces
and figures, others passed their lives with
draperies, backgrounds, leaves and flow
ers; but nowadays the much better sys
tem exists of training the young people
to execute heads and flesh as well as ac
cessories. The cleverest worker cannot
possibly complete more than three and a
half yards in a year, while an average
worker does not execute annually more
than one yard. And how much do they
ernment. A dose of imperialism would
stiffen the back of our democracy.
It is true, no doubt, that our standing
in the world is lowered because our
best statesmen are not in politics to
the degree that they are in England.
The rules of the game shut them out.
But I believe that we can change these
rules by forces now at work. Wiser
voters will demand better representa
tives, but these must keep in touch
with the people, acting with them and
through them, never in their stead. For
reasons I shall give later on I believe
that to adopt British forma, with all
their unquestioned advantages, would
be a step backward and downward.
The chief real argument for the re
tention of the Philippines rests on the
belief that if we do not take them they
will fall into worse hands. This may
be true, but it is open to question. It
is easy to treat them as Spain has done;
but none of the eloquent voices raised
for annexation has yet suggested any
thing better. We must also recognize
that the nerve and courage of Dewey
and his associates seem spent to little
avail if we cast away what we have
won. To leave the Philippines, after all
this, seems like patriotism under false
pretenses. But nothing could have in
duced us to accept these islands, if of
fered for nothing, before the battle of
Manila.
So far aa the Philippines are con
cerned, the only righteous thing to do
would be to recognize the independence
of the Philippines under American pro
tection, and to lend them our army and
navy and our wisest counselors, our
Dewey and our Merritt, not our poli
ticians, but our jurists, our teachers,
with foresters, electricians, manufac
turers, mining experts and experts in
the various Industries. Then, after they
have hÂ£d a fair chance and shown that
they cannot care for themselves, we
should turn them over quietly to the
paternalism of peace-loving Holland or
peace-compelling Great Britain. We
should not get our money back, but we
should save our honor. The only sensi
ble thing to do would be to pull out
some dark night and escape from the
great problem of the Orient as sud
denly and as dramatically as we got
into it.
As for trade, to take a weak nation
by the throat is not the righteous way
to win its trade. It is not true that
"trade follows the flag." Trade flies
through the open door. To open the
door of the Orient is to open our own*
doors to Asia. To do this hurries us
on toward the final "manifest destiny,"
the leveling of the nations. Where the
barriers are all broken down, and the.

After five or six years of apprenticeship

In the institution not more than $SOO, with
$1000 for the superintendents. Of course
the pension and the house for old age
ameliorate these conditions. The honor
too, as my old man indicated, counts for
much.
Twelve or fifteen years of constant la
bor are at least necessary before one is
considered an experienced worker and
sufficiently qualified to labor on the finest
tapestries. We will never have any Gobe
lin tapestries In America I thought
when this last statement was made to
me. To leave a man in a Government po
sition until he was qualified to do some
thing would be considered a sin crying
out to heaven for vengeance. Imaglno

The Gobelin tapestries are beyond the
power of money. The Government of
France will not sell them under any con
ditions, but reserves them for the decora
tion of public bulldinps or for gifts to
friendly monarchs. Under the old regime
when kings and palaces were the fashion
in France there were more opportunities
for th.' tapestry workers â there were
more whims to gratify.
However, one feels that it Is well that
these hands have nfit lost their cunning,
for the days of kings and whims might
come again. After visiting Fontalnebleau
and Versailles and Baint Germain, where
these silent palaces are always ready for
occupancy, one receives an irradlcable im
pression that France is half expecting the
king to arrive, at any hour of the night.

About 50 per cent of these vessels became
total wrecks, all the crews being lost.

American institutions cannot exist. But
the spirit of freedom goes with its
deeds.
I do not urge the money cost of hold
ing the Philippines as an argument
against annexation. No dependent
colony, honestly administered, ever re
paid its cost to the government, and
this colony holds out not the slightest
promise of such a result. In fact, the
cost of conquest and maintenance in
life and gold is in grotesque excess of
any possible advantage to trade or to
civilization. Individuals grow rich, but
no honest government gets its money
back. But with all this, if annexation
is a duty, it is such regardless of cost.
But America has governmental ideals
of the development of the individual
man. England has no care for the man,
only for .civic order. This unfits Amer
ica for certain tasks for which England
is prepared.
But though one in blood with Eng
land, our course of political activities
has not lain parallel wilh hers. We
were estranged in the beginning, and
we have had other affairs on our hands.
We have turned our faces westward,
and our work has made us strong. We
have had our forests to clear, our
prairies to break, our rivers to harness,
our own problem of slavery to adjust.
While England has been making trade
we have been making men. We have
no machinery to govern colonies well.
We want no such machinery if we can
help It. The habit of our people and
the tendency of our forms of govern
ment are to lead people to mind their
own business. Only the business of in
dividuals or groups of individuals re
ceives attention. Our representatives
In Congress are our attorneys, retained
to look after our interests, the interest
of the State or district, not of the na
tion. A colony has no attorney, and
its demands, as matters now stand,
must go by default. This is the reason
why we fail in the government of colo
nies. This is the reason why our con
sular service is weak and inefficient.
This is the reason why our forests are
wasted year by year. Nothing is well
done in a republic unless it touches the
interest or catches the attention of the
people. Unless a colony knows what
good government Is and insists loudly
on ,2" \! ng [t ' with some means to make
itself heard, it will be neglected and
abused. This is why every body of
people under the American flag must
have a share in the American govern
ment. When a colony knows what good
government is it ceases to be a colony
and can take care of itself.
To do what England does we must
take lessons of England's methods.
Toward- the English system we muÃt
approach more and more closely If we
are to deal with foreign interests in
large fashion. The town-meeting idea
must give way to centralization of
power. We must look away from our
own affairs, neglect them even, until
the pressure of growing expenditure
forces us to attend to them again more
carefully than we ever yet have done.
One reason England is governed well is
that misgovernment anywhere on any
large scale would be fatal to her credit
and fatal to her power. She must call
her best men to her service because
without them she would perish. Our
government must be changed for our
changing needs. We must give up our
whole protective system at the demand
of commerce. I. for one, shall never
weep at that. But we must abandon
our childish notions that America is
a world of herself, big enough to main
tain a separate basis of coinage, a free
man's scale of wages or a social order
of her own.
We must give up the checks and bal
ances in our constitution. It is said
that our great battleship Oregon can
turn about, end for end, within her own
length. The dominant nation must have
the same power. She must be capable
of reversing her action in a minute, or
turning around within her own length.
This "our prate of statutes and of
state" makes impossible. We shall re
ceive many hard knocks before we
reach this condition, but we must reach
it If we are to "work mightily" in the
affairs of the other nations. If we are
to deal with crises in foreign affairs we
must hold them with a steadier grasp
than that with which we have held the
Cuban question. The Spanish Peace
Commission knows well that It is no
empire with which it has to deal. An
empire knows its own mind and never
yields a point. As matters are now
President, Senate and House check
each other's movements, and the State
falls over its own feet.
The question Is not whether Great
Britain or the United States has the
better form of government or the nobler
civic mission. There is room in the
world for two types of Anglo-Saxon
nations, and nothing has yet happened
to show that civilization would gain if
either were to take up the function of
the other. We may not belittle the tre
mendous services of England in the en
forcement of laws amid barbarism. We
may not deny that every aggression of
hers on weaker nations results in good
to the conquered, but we insist that our
own function of turning masses into
men, of "knowing men by name," is as
noble as hers. Better for the world that
the whole British empire should be dis
solved, as it must be late or soon, than
that the United States should forget
her own mission In a mad chase of
emulation. He reads history to little
purpose who finds in Imperial dominion
a result, a cause or even a sign of na
tional greatness. Infinitely stronger for
the cause of freedom, says Justice
Brewer, "than the power of our armies,
is the force of our example."
We may have a navy and coaling
stations to meet our commercial needs
without entering on colonial expansion.
It takes no war to accomplish this hon
orably. Whatever land we may need
in our business we may buy in the open
market as we buy coal. If the owners
will accept our price it needs no Im
perialism to foot the bills. But the
question of such need is one for com
mercial experts, not for politicians. Our
decision should be in the Interest of
commerce, not of sea power. We need,
no doubt, navy enough to protect us
from insults, even though every battle
ship, Charles Sumner pointed out fifty
years ago, costs as much as Harvard
College, and though schools, not battle
ships, make the strength of the United
States.
Some great changes in our system
are inevitable, and belong to the coursa
of natural progress. Against these I
have nothing to say. Whatever our part
in the affairs of the world, we should
play it manfully. I make no plea tot
self-sufficiency, indifference, or isola
tion for isolation's sake. To shirk tha
world-movements or to drift with tha
current would be alike unworthy of our
origin, our history and our ideals.
In closing let me repeat what seem
to me the three main reasons for oppos
ing every step toward imperialism.
First, dominion is brute force. To fur
nish such power we shall need a colon
ial bureau, with its force of extra-na
tional police. A large army and navy
must justify itself by doing something.
An army and navy we must maintain
for our own defense, but beyond that
they can do little that does not hurt,
and they must be used if they would
be kept alive.
The other reasons concern the integ
rity of the republic itself. This was
the lesson of slavery, that no republic
can "endure half slave and half free."
The republics of antiquity fell because
they were republics of the free only.
for each citizen rested on the backs of
nine slaves. A republic cannot be an
oligarchy as well. Whatever form of
control we adopt, we shall be in fact
slave-drivers, and the business of slave
driving will react upon us. Slavery
itself was a disease which came to us
from the British West Indies. It breeds
in the tropics like yellow fever and
leprosy. Can even an imperial republic
last, part slave, part free?
â¢ Â« â¢
Meanwhile, the real problems of civi
lization develop and ripen. They care
nothing for the greatness of empire or
the glitter of imperialism. They must
be solved by men, and each man must
help solve his own problems. The de
velopment of republican manhood is
just now the most important matter
that any nation in the world has on
hand. We have been fairly suc
cessful thus far, but perhaps only
fairly. Our government is careless,
wasterful and unjust, but our men are
growing self-contained and wise. De
spite the annual invasion of foreign il
literacy, despite the degeneration of
congested cities, the individual intel
ligence of men stands higher in Amer
ica than in any other part of the world.
The bearing of the people at large in
these days is a lesson in itself.
The day of the nations as nations
is passing. National ambitions, na
tional hopes, national aggrandizement â
all these may become public nuisances.
Imperialism, like feudalism, belongs to
the past. The men of the world as men,
not as nations, are drawing closer and
closer together. The final guarantee of
peace and good will among men will be
not the parliament of nations, but the
self-control of men. Whatever the fate
ful twentieth century may bring, the
first great duty of Americans is never
to forget that men are more than na
tions, that wisdom is more than glory,
and virtue more than dominion of the
sea. The nation exists for its men,
never the men for the nation. "The
only government that I recognize,"
said Thoreau, "and it matters not how
few are at the head of it or how small
its army, is the power that established
justice in the land, never that which
established injustice." The will of free
men to be just one toward another is
our best guarantee that "government
of the people, for the people, and by the
people, shall not perish from the earth."

FOUND AND PHOTOGRAPHED THE ONLY IDOL IN ALASKA.
Worshiped by the Natives
and Sacrifices Made to It
Until Very Recently.
ONE of the most remarkable trips
ever made from San Francisco
to Alaska and back has just been
finished by Arthur C. Pillsbury,
a Palo Alto student.
During his absence Mr. Pills-
V>ury accomplished the astonishing feat
of journeying frotn Seattle to Alaska in
a 20-foot gasoline launch. He followed
the same route aa the big ocean steam
ers and covered the 700 miles to Alas
kan waters in safety. The entire trip
was one series of adventures.
At Dlxor.s Entrance, after a stretch
of fifty miles of open sea voyage In a
storm, his small craft was dashed on
the rocks and broken in two. But he
pot another boat and continued his voy
age to Wrangel, from which point he
worked out into the country in all di
rections. He found the only idol on
American soil that is worshiped to-day
nnd also took a flashlight photograph
of a potlatch dance in full blast. A 6
far as known, this is the only photo
graph of one of these mysterious In
dian ceremonies that has ever been
taken.
While in the interior of Alaska, M>.
Pillsbury had numbers of adventures,
and on several occasions had to beat
a hasty retreat for violating some of
the Indians' ideas of what ought to be
photographed. But he escaped with
a sound skin and feels amply repaid
for the dangers of the trip, as he ac
complished a great deal and secured a
number of valuable relics of the old
days before the white men came.
In d small room at Palo Alto Mr.
Pillsbury has his study. Here he is
surrounded by all sorts of Alaskan cu
rios and photographs. Of the latter h*
has many hundred, but the place of
honor Is given to the one of the mon
strous Idol, which has a remarkable
value, because it is the only one in
existence.
"I went to Alaska for the
purpose of studying the
country and to get
what satisfaction I could out of the
trip," said Mr. Pillsbury when speaking
of the matter.
"It took me a long time to make up
my mind to go, but after I had done so
I concluded to go in the best shape pos
sible and to see as much of the un
usual as I could. I also determined to
take as many photographs of unusual
scenes as possible. In this I have been
more successful than I expected. But
the trip was an exciting one.

Strange Ways of Making Oath
There is more than a touch of the
grotesque, as well as of the solemn, in
the modes of administering oaths in
certain countries, says Tit-Bits. When
a Chinaman swears to tell the truth
he kneels down and a china saucer is
given to him. This he proceeds to
break- in pieces, and the following oath
ia then administered: "You shall tell
the truth and the whole truth. The
eaucer is cracked, and if you do not
tell (he truth your soul will be cracked
like the saucer."
ether symbolic variations of the Chi
nese oath are the extinguishing of a
candle or cutting off a cock's head,
the iight of the candle representing the
witness' soul and the fate of the cock
eyir.bolizing the fate of a perjurer.
In certain parts of India tigers' and
lizards' skins take the place of the
Bible of Christian countries, and the
penalty of breaking the oath is that in
one case the witness will become the
prey of a tiger, and in the other that
his body will be covered with scales
like a lizard.
One of the most terrible of European
oaths is that administered in Nor
wegian courts of law. The prelude to
the oath proper is a long homily on
the sanctity of the oath and the- terri
ble consequences of not keeping it.
Part of this lengthy sermon takes this
form :
"If you swear a falpe oath the pood
ness and mercy of God will not avail
you, but you will be punished eternally
In hell as a perverse and hardened sin
ner. If you swear falsely, all your pos
uesslons will be cursed; your land and
meadows, so that they will yield you no
fruit" your cattle and sheep will be
barren, and all that you enjoy in this
world will become a curse to you."
When the witness is duly crushed by
the sense of his fearful responsibility
tb* oath is administered, while he holds
a 20-foot gasoline launch, the Madrone.
At Seattle I left the big steamer and
continued the Journey to Alaska in the
launch. In order to be supplied with
gasoline I sent quantities of It ahead
and picked it up as I went along.
"My launch was a comfortable one,
with hardwood cabin and all sorts of
conveniences, but it was none too com
fortable considering the rigors of the
climate. My father was with me, but
he didn't enjoy the trip In the least,
as he is not used to boats and certain
kinds of hardships.
"When we left Seattle the weather
was simply beautiful and we went
down the river at a lively rate, but in
a few hours we were buried in fog and
didn't dare go forward or backward.
I had never been in that part of the
â¢world before, and had not the least
Idea of where land was. There was
nothing to do but to lie there in mo
mentary danger of being run down by
some vessel. This was most trying
and wearing to the nerves. All night
long the fog lasted, but when momingr
came the sun burst through and a
breeze came up. I then saw that we
were not 200 yards from a jagged,
rocky reef that would have cut our
Journey short right there if we had run
into it.
"Clear, weather followed for a week,
nnd by this time we were up behind
Vancouver, where the water was
smooth and the air warm. I made no
attempt to hurry along, but simply let
the boat make such time as it could
without crowding. When we came to
a nice place we stopped until we got
tired. I don't think our rate of travel
was more than. 100 miles a week.
"The sight of such a small craft run
ning along through those lonely waters
naturally attracted attention, and
we were in considerable dan-
ger of being robbed. When
we tied up at night,
unless we were near
some settlement, we
always kept far from
shore. Once a band of In
dians chased us in thair canoes.
But of course the launch was able
to show a clean pair of heels, greatly
to their surprise. A few shots were
fired, but fortunately none struck us.
"Once we got stuck on a sandbar at
the mouth of a creek and didn't get
off for two days. Another time we ran
sideways on a log and almost upset.
Â«Mr boat sprung a leak one night and,
I while we slept, almost filled with
â water. If we had slept an hour longer
It would have sunk. To repair this
took several days. At night, when we
were close to shore, we could hear the
wild animals barking and howling.
They had a scent of us and were close
to the water's edge, waiting In the hope
that they might reach us. I killed
several of these. There are the skins
over there.
"For most of the journey up behind
the islands the weather was simply per
fection. There were a few rainy days,
but none of them very disagreeable.
But just as we needed the fine weather
we didn't got it.
"This was when we crossed from
aloft his thumb and fore and middle
lingers, as an emblem of the Trinity.
It is a little curious that the expres
sion, "the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth," in very slightly
varied forms, runs through almost all
the oaths administered in European
courts.
The Mohammedan takes the oath
with his forehead reverently resting on
the open Koran. He takes his "bible"
in his hands, and, stooping low, as if
in the presence of a higher power,
slowly bows his head until it touches
the book, which to him is inspired. In
the reverence of his acts and the un
swerving loyalty to an oath many Eu
ropeans have much to learn, from a
follower of Mohammed.
In certain parts of Spain the witness,
when taking an oath, crosses the thumb
of one hand over the forefinger of the
other, and kjssing this symbolic, if
primitive, cross, says, "By this cross I
swear to tell the truth."
In the mure usual form of administer
ing the oath in Spain, the witness
kneels solemnly before the Bible and
places his ri.uht hand reverently upon
it. The Judge then asks him: "Will
you swear, in the name of God and
his holy hook, to speak the truth in
answer to all questions that may be
asked you?" The witness answers: "I
swear." The Judge then concludes: "If
you do this God will reward you; but
if you fail he will require an account
of you."
An Austrian takes his oath in front
of a crucifix, flanked by lighted candles.
With upraised right hand he says: "I
swear by the all powerful and all wise
God that 1 will speak the whole and
clean truth, and nothing but the truth,
in answer to any questions that may be
asked in this court."
"Papa," said Tommy Tredway.
"Now, Tommy," replied Mr. Tredway,
"I shall answer only one more question
to-day. So be careful what you ask."
"Yes, papa.'"
"Well, go on."

Sea?"â Household Words.

awfully squeamish when I realized
what a tiny shell we were in out in that
ocean of wild water.
"So I opened the valves as wide as
possible and let her go at her best.
How that boat did roll and rock! The
waves became larger and larger and the
storm increased in fury.
"Before we were half way across to
Dixons Entrance I felt that we would
never reach our destination. Our little
cork of a boat was buried in the trough
of the sea one moment and the next
riding on the crest of a mountain wave.
Then we plunged down and half of the
wave came tumbling on top of us. Our
little boat was buried in foam and
water. But we plowed ahead every
moment even though we had to tie our
selves in to keep from being injured by
being bumped against the sides of the
boat. I knew there was only one hope
for us and that was to reach land. If
the boat capsized or became disabled
we were doomed, as escape after that
was impossible.
"Our worst trouble came when we ran
into a cross sea. Here the waves seemed
to jump and dash in all directions at
once. Water came down our exhaust

"When at last land did come in sight
I had little idea that we could reach it.
The sea was rougher than ever, and it
was almost impossible to manage the
boat. When we got near enough to
see the houses on land I saw that there
was no harbor or landing place. Only
a bare, sandy beach, with mountain
waves tumbling on it in wild confusion.
"There was only one thing to do and
that was to try and make our boat hit
the beach as square as possible. I kept

In this city of estates which were for sale
in the provinces, and, after obtaining in

intended victims, started boldly on their
campaign.
One of them called, as if by the merest
chance, to look at the property in ques
tion, explaining that he thought it would
just suit a friend, who might wish to run
down there now and then. An appoint
ment was made, and in the course of a
few days an accomplice appeared, in com
pany with the original visitor, and was
introduced as tho likely purchaser. The
bargain was discussed over a good de
jeuner, and then it was suggested by one
of the strangers that so many thousand
francs should be put down as a guaranty
in the event of the buyer eventually
changing his mind, a like sum also being
deposited by the seller, who would also
forfeit it if he determined, after all, on
retaining the house and grounds.
In not a few cases the proposition was
gladly accepted; the money was placed
by the owner of the estate In a cash box,
which, in turn, was inclosed In a small
portmanteau, which one of the visitors
volunteered to leave with him, and which
was specially arranged for the trick.

and shook their heads.
"After this, though, they told me all
about the idol. it seems that the
wooden image was carved about 150
years ago and ever since then the tribe
has worshiped it and made sacrifices
to It. As late as 1880 human beings
were sacrificed to it, and would be to

dous heights birds sometimes traverse the
air. Of course, most of our common Brit

do not as a rule rise higher than the tree
tops, except when migrating: then they
fly at an average height of 200 feet of 300
feetâ higher or lower, according to the
prevailing air currents. Herons and wild
ducks, geose and swans, when traveling
long distances fly at greater heights, often
as much as 2000 feet. But it is the hawk,
and more particularly the vulture tribe,
that constantly wing the air at far greater
limits than these. The common buzzard

scattered after them with a great deal of threatening, and intention

of <io'i and Washington" upon the deluded tribe and drive them back
like sh^op to their fold. Besides, after the morning's amusement, the hot
sun mado rest welcome.
"Sound the recall." said Pillogg to his senior trumpeter, and at once
threw himself from his horse, lay at full length on the grass, and produced
his flask and cigar case.
The bugle rang brightly over the plain, and, as its clear command filled
the distant hollows and rang from bluff to bluff, the distant shouting and
firing gradually censed. While the captain puffed hia cigar at ease, and
the trumpeter stood holding the horses beside him, the roar of the first
sergeant forming the troop came to their ears, and In a few minutes, with
much snorting of excited horses, and clatter of steel, the men came gallop-

"Call thÂ« roll." said Captain Pillogg. remounting, and the first ser

tled off the names, while the officer eyed tach man critically as he an
swered "Here." There were soma casualties. One man was badly hurt
by a shot in the side; others were scratched, but one alone was missing.
The captain, who had led the fip-ht in the beginning of the affair, thought
con?ilinglv of the number of Indians bowled over, who had mostly been
carried off by their comrades. The first sergeant swung his horse about
and saluted.
"One man missing, sir," he reported. "The second trumpeter, Thomas
Cox."
"Anybody know anything about him? Anybody see him drop?"
A trooper replied that "Tommy" was riding hard-mouthed Rip, and.in
the pursuit, appeared to have all he could do to hold the horse in. The
trooper opined that Rip. being half crazy at the best of times, had gone
mad with excitement and borne Tommy Cox "into the next county." The
captain had Just ordered the sergeant to detail a corporal and men to look
up the missing, when, from the direction of the Indians' flight, there came
a mad clatter of hoofs and a shout. Up chaxped the missing bugler, a
smooth-faced lad, with saber rattling wildly upainst his side, his bugle
pounding his back, and his bridle hand, though touching the rein, evidently
powerless to control his foaming, wild-eyed horse, who dashed pellmell
into the troop, and came to a standstill only when it had Jammed itself
between two bruised and cursing troopers. Tommy's right arm desper
ately embraced a wiggling bundle of dirty shirt and red-brown skin, and
from this bundle came a hideous succession of howls and snarling lamen
tations. The troopers leaned forward on their horses" necks to look, and
at once there ran from right to left a rumble of sardonic laughter.
"What is that, sir?" the captain asked, and peered disgustedly at tha
bundle.
"Please, sir." said Tommy, a year in the service and glorying In his
first expedition, "a prisoner, sir."
"Oh. !" cried Pilloge. and the troopers roared. "Let the papoose

"No, sir." said Tommy, very red and anxious. "But he's such a little
devil, and he's hurt, and Iâ l'm afraid I've killed his father, so Iâ l thought
I'd bring him along. O! Ah! O!"
The wrippling Indian child had writhed about until it got Tommy's
hand between its teeth, and was now biting: like a rat. When the next
man in rank? overcame his laughter sufficiently to release the bugler the
captain was smilintr.
"You killed the father, eh? How did it happen you did not keep up
â with the troop?"
Tommy eager to excuse himself, and hot at the laughter of the
grizzled troop, hastily explained.
"Rip pot a bit the best of me." he Jerked out, "and ran wild. "We lost
sight of the other fellows, sir. an' over there the horse bolted up a coulee.
ThTe was an In.iun without a pony, an' he turned an' fired on me. So I
fired back with my revolver, an' (Tommy grinned with modest pride) I
dropped the sonâ dropped him. sir, deader "than stuffing. This here kid
howled; I guess the bullet grazed him. An'â an' I got Rip in hand an'
dismounted an' took the kid; he fought like a wildcat, an' he bitesâ Jlng!
can't he bite'"
"If you'd taken the rifle It would have been more, sensible," Pillogg
drawled. "What do you want to do -with him?"
"He can't walk, sir," Tommy protested, "an' I was kinder sorry for
him. He's so durned cute when he wrastles an' bites, an' he'd die If I
left him there all night."
The captain turned away.
"When these beggars Have come to their senses again," he said,
"they'll send for him. You can bring him along If you'll guarantee to
nurse him. 'Tentlon! right forward, fours right, march!"
In this manner the Weasel was brought to Fort 8. and Introduced to
the mysteries of civilization. His father and mother dead, none of his
tribe claimed him, and Tommy Cox, the bugler, became, despite of the
men's frequent jests, a father, tutor and friend to him. Tommy was yet
young enough to retain great freshness of soul and simplicity of heart.
The fact that he had shot the little savage's father and made an orphan
of the Weasel weighed upon his conscience, and he was very zealous In
his care of the Indian. Nevertheless, a seven-year-old redskin is a
troublesome anomaly In the garrison, where the women of laundress* row
looked on him as they might upon the direct spawn of the devil, haling:
their own offspring from him when the Weasel would have shared their
games. Had they had their way the boy would have been sent back to
the reservation. A powerful Influence ' was exerted,-'' however, -in the
"Weasel's Behalf, an influence than which none greater was felt In Fort S.
Miss Toonle Adalr. little six-year-old daughter of the colonel, who had
been christened Judith (a name to which she never answered), to the hor
ror of all the laundresses, took a fancy to the Weasel and at once adopted
him as her own special protege. What T6onle said, when she said it from
the colonel's knee, with her arm round his neck, invariably was accepted
as a post order, and the Weasel's position was assured.
"You're a dreadful wicked little savage." said Toonle, seated on the
colonel's porch, with the Weasel squatting In front of her. his big black
eyes solemnly staring Into the deeps of tier big blue ones. "Ain't you
sorry God boraed you a savage? Do you like blue eyes? My eyes are blue,
and they're very pretty. When you know how to speak English, you must
tell me I have pretty blue eyes. Everybody doesâ everybody I like. Did
you ever scalp anybody? If you were to scalp me my father would kill
youâ he would, with a pistol and sword, because he says my hair Is the
prettiest In the world. You've black hair. It's not pretty; it's savage.

fault you was horned an Injun, and. if you're good, I'll make you a
Christian, and then p'raps God will make your eyes blue and pretty like
mine." â¢ .
To these remarks of Miss Toonie the Weasel could make no reply, but
he developed a great natural quickness and intelligence, and between the
labor of Tommy Cox and the chatter of Toonle he speedily began to un
derstand and make himself understood.
Little Miss Adatr. in those artless days, was intensely military. A
civilian was for her a thing to look upon with, pity, not unmlngled with
contempt. She Insisted upon having her frocks made of light blue kers.ey
of the same stuff as her father's regimental trousers. Her favorite reefer
was, similarly, of dark blue cloth, with cavalry stamped brass buttons
and her brown curls were usually adorned by a small-sized forage cap

Dangers of Student Life in Paris.
Mrs. Frye, wife of Senator FryÂ©, accompanied him to Paris. While he attended the sessions
of the Peace Commission she investigated student life in Paris, and the following is her warning to
American girls:
Among: American art students and their friends the recent ut
terances of Mrs. Frye on the subject of student life in Paris have
caused a great deal of comment. Mrs. Frye is the wife of Senator
Frye, who, as everybody knows, was a member of the Peace Com
mission.
When the Senator sailed for foreign shorc3 he took his wife with
him. While he wrestled with the knotty problems confronting the
members of the commission Mrs. Frye studied Paris, particularly
the Liatln Quarter. She formed some strong convictions and has ex
pressed them since her return with engaging candor. Several of
these found their way Into print and thus into American studios.
Mrs. Frye has consented to an interview, which to-day for the first
time gives fully and correctly her views on the subject in which she
feels so deep an interest.
I FIRMLY believe that In sounding
the warning note concernlnlg stu
dent life in Paris I am doing a
kindness to thousands of Ameri
can parents who are ignorant of
the real conditions that surround
their children who are studying abroad.
I have been asked by many people if
my objection to the art study In Paris
is founded on the constant use of nude
models for classes including both sexes.
I have replied that I make no com
plaint on this ground. The study of
the nude is necessary in the pursuit of
art. We have art schools in our own
country attended by both sexes.
My objection to Paris life for stu
dents is the total lack of decorous re
straint which should exist between
young people. I object to the break
ing down of barriers to which the peo
ple of thf> United States are accus
tomed. There h> no Sundayâ all days
are alike for enjoyment and dissipa
tion. There are no restrictions, and
morals are entirely a matter of private
concern, about which no one is sup
posed to inquire.
This universal license cannot but be
productive of sad results. I saw many
sad Fights and I heard pathetic stories
during my frequent visits to tho Latin
Quarter. I know whereof I speak when
I say it is better for our young people
never to learn art or music than to
learn them under such terrible odds.

AMONG the many curious trades
into which the modern young
woman has ventured In her search

There arc several young women engaged
in this trade in San Francisco, but the
pioneers in the field are the Misses Anna

About five years ago Miss Agnes, fresh
from the classroom, discovered her voca

her table, no matter whore she put it,
made the room appear small. She went to
the furniture stores looking in vain for
an oak table about four feet long and two
feet wide with an upper and lower shelf.
At last, when a carpenter suggested that
he could make one the thought struck

Full of her new idea she invested in a
of tools and made a trip to the

I tried to get some exact statistics

"Papa!" she cried, la the first enthusiasm of her liking for the little
Bavage. "Now I'm a real, real colonel, just like you. I'm going: to have
an orderly. And, please, papa, may he have a uniform?"
The laundresses and all ethers ill disposed toward the little Indian had
now no, word to say. Toonie's orderly became a feature of Fort 8. Where
the little girl went, there went he, even to accompanying herâ at the regu
lation distance behind, for Toonie was nothing if not disciplinarian, and
kept him in his placeâ on her sudden dashes, ponyback. into the surround
ing country and about the post. For himâ wnen the big black eyes soft
ened It was at Toonie's voice; when he bent to study his lessons it was at
Toonie's behest; when he returned, as he did several times, after running
away in search of savage freedom, It was to stand meekly and mourn
fully before Toonie's tearful rebuke. For Tommy Cox he had a regard,
varied by sudden outbursts of. passionate disobedience; to Toonie his de
votion was always unbrokenly simple and doglike in its faithfulness.
Sometimes the officers Joked the little maid on her orderly, but never after
the year in which she was nine and the Weasel about 10.
She had dashed away on one of her willful trips of exploration, fol
lowed at a gallop by the Weasel. It was glaring summertime, and by the
river, far from the post, grew big, red plums, In succulent profusion, cool
and Juicy. To feast on these at leisure the girl dismounted, and the Weasel
tied the ponies to a tree. He was not yet finished with this, office, Toonie
plunging at once In the bushes, when the boy was startled by a terrible
cry. He quickly made the ponies fast and darted to the child's aid. She
sat upon the ground In tearful fright, white and sobbing.
"The snake! The snake!" she cried. "A great big rattlesnakeâ lt bit
me!"
She clutched her ankle and moaned. The little Indian did not hesitate;
he did not lose his head. At some time In his life with his own people he
muat have witnessed some such scenes, for now he acted with decision
and knowledge In a oaae where a white boy would have been helpless. He
tore the low shoe and little stocking away, and there, already, was the
swelling redness of the serpent's bite. He owned a knife, the gift of a
orotheriy trooper, and this he whipped out. No doubt his black eyes
gleamed strangely with excitement, for Toonle was overcome with new
terror at sight of them and of the sharp and shining blade. In spite of her
screams the grimly silent Weasel seized the lex and deliberately and firmly

filled the air, but the boy uttered never a word, only stopping now and
then to peer into his mistress' blue and frightened eyes anxiously. These
did not dim; her rigor did not lessen, and the W easel sucked away with
confidence. At last he took her handkerchief and bound up the wound,
dragged her to her pony and helped her mount. She was a wonderfully
strong and healthful young person, and did not whimper nor faint, only
howled in a sturdy and wholesome way. The Weasel rode by her side at
a tearing gallop back to the post and straight to the hospital. The doctor
applied his remedies, but they were not needed, for the rude promptitude
of the Indian's action had drawn the poison. Toonie bore an ugly scar
afterward, and betrayed an awed respect for and a little fear of her or
derly for a long time, but the doctor was enthusiastic, and the colonel let
It be understood that the Weasel was henceforth his own particular
a And now his position was firmly assured. No longer did Trumpeter
Tommy have to bear ridicule on account of his pet; no more did the laun
dresses dare to speak of him as an outrageous heathen But the Weasel
seemed to care absolutely nothing for compliments and praise. He was
conscious that he had saved Toonie's life, and In many little ways he
showed that he considered himself no longer merely her messenger, but
her duly authorized protector. ,
In the passage of time It became necessary for the girl to desert the
wild but beautiful life of the Western plains and go East to be educated.
The colonel decided to send Weasel away at the same time to one of these
great institutions which are maintained for the benefit of the nation a
wards. Thus it came that the two parted, the mistress and the orderly.
Toonie gave him her photograph with tears.
"You're never, never to forget me. she said; promise.
"Never," said the Weasel, with Badly earnest eyes. â,ââ,Â«Â« ..
"And when I come back you'll be my orderly Just the same, promise.
"Just the Bame." said the Weasel.
But when she came back she was no longer , Toonie .the child. She
was Miss Adalr, no further opposed to being called Judith; indeed, pre
ferring it to the loving pet name of her babyhood which, she said, was
silly. The Indian was back on the plains, very tall and straight, in neat
garments of civilization. He had passed through the school with much
honor, and was now to act as a missionary among his own people. Trie
colonel was amusedly proud of htm, as of a fine dog of his own breeding.
He sent for him on the night of Judith Adalr's arrival.
"Here's your old orderly, my dear," said he.
She looked up from the chair where she was reading some letters
looking at him with a smile of curiosity. . , .
"Well, I never, papa!" she said. "He looks quite civilized. I am glad
to hear you get on so well," she added with a nod to the Weasel, and re
sumed her reading. . __. _ ,
The Indian went out silently, nor looked so tall and straight and hap
pily expectant as when he entered.
He had ridden in from the mission, ten miles from the post, where he
was quartered. The moon was up when he silently left the post after that
chilling, indifferent greeting. The clouds that scurried low between earth,
and moon cast flickering, hasty shadows on the uneven plain, but the
shadow that had fallen on his life never lifted. Before him, as he rode,
stretched the shimmering, shallow river, darkly fringed by those low
bushes whence the rattlesnake had dartedâ so short a time ago. It had
seemed to him so short a time, until to-night. Now he realized that an age
had passed. Perhaps it had never happened; It was a dream. It must have
been a dream, or the chill young lady In the parlor he had left, who had
told him so carelessly he was quite civilized, would have remembered. Ha
was civilized. For years he had lived with white people. He barely re
membered the baby days of tepoes and squaws and ponies and bows and
arrows. She had civilized himâ she and the long, happy thoughts of her
In the days at school and college when his own blood brothers had been
things of pity to him, because tfiey had never been blessed by friendship
with herâ when his teachers had wondered at his towering ambition and
his Intense industry. His horse, unhindered, fell to walking leisurely. The
Indian's head drooped. Swiftly there came to him a conviction of the
wrong done him. Over all those great plains there were two other peoples,
two great familiesâ the white and the red. Each member of these nad his
brother, hie father, close ties of kinship. In all the breadth of the land he
Stood utterly alone and apart. He was civilizedâ half and half, neither one
thing nor the other. He had turned away from his brothers at thÂ« beck
of his teachers. He had done his task; he had succeeded. He had been
held up as a shining light, an example of what might be done with one
of his race There It stopped. He had dreamed of being a white among
whites, whose creed had been dinned in his earsâ "all men are equal!
Only to-night had she. by a glance and a word, let him realize how he had
deceived himself. To please her he had obeyed as a child, studied as a boy,
labored at college. To please her.
"Well, I never. He looks quite dvillzed. I am glad to hear you are
getting on so well," she had said.
He would not go back to the post nor to the mission. He cared notn
tng for their good will if he was not to be one of them. What then?
At a crossing of trails he met an old Indian freighter going to the poet
to sell watermelons to the soldiers. The Weasel stopped him and gave nlm
some money and made a bargain, and the old freighter went on his way
with a good Buit of clothes from the East, and the weasel dashed into the
darkness, where hid far, far away the Indian reservation, and on his legs
and feet were frftiged and beaded moccasins, and round him was wrapped
a gaudy blanket. He had chosen his family, his people, among whom he
would be an equal at least. He had retrograded, lapsed into savagery.
One of the chief delights of his Eastern teachers, when showing off their
star pupil to Congressmen and inquiring philanthropists, had been to dwell
upon the fact that the lad belonged to one of the most unruly and hope
lessly savage tribes on the plainsâ a tribe which was constantly restless,
an annual annoyance to the Indian Bureau, addicted to sun dances, ghost
dances, raiding and other symptoms of Incurable Indian fever. Just at
this time they were disturbed unusually by the prominence among them
of a certain young buck who aspired to leadership and was Inciting his
comrades to all manner of Indian deviltry.
As the Weasel rode toward the reservation that night, and while yet
many miles from the legally constituted camp, he heard the beat of savage
drums in a lonely valley off the trail, and. In the somber despair of his
heart, he galloped toward the sound, eager to join his kin, and have the
ordeal of return over. H*> came on a scene which made him rein in ab
ruptly. By moonlight and the glare of fires he saw the fearful crowd,
painted, plumed and feathered, flourishing guns and old-fashioned toma
hawks, leaping, howling, dancing In devilish circles of frenzied eyes and
convulsed limbs, while the drums beat and the singers chanted a war
song. Not that alone! In the middle of the circle they had erected a kind
of gallows, and from it depended ropes, with barbed hooks at the end. By
these hooks, imbedded in the muscles of their shoulders, hung young men,
with grim, determined, silent lips and sweating brows, waiting stoically
until the flesh would tear away and allow them to drop. Through such an
ordeal they would pass to a rank of warriors. Did they falter and cry out
and beg to be cut down, their place would be with the women and chil
dren. The Weasel, fresh from civilization, from school and study, from
church and chapel, sickened at the sight of his brothers thus employed.
Th*y saw him speedily, and were soon about him, recognizing him, for his
history was well known in the tribe. They applauded his blanket, sign of
return to his own folk; they Jeered him for staying so long away, and he
found, to his distress, that his tongue, so long unused to it, halted when
he sought to answer them in their own, his own. language. He told them
that he had come back for good; that the talk of the white man was de
ceitful, and no red man could ever be one of them; that such a one as he
must submit to be an inferior, an object of mingled curiosity and con
tempt. He, he said, had the heart of a proud man, of a free man, and
must live with his fellow men as an equal in all things, or die. They danced
about him. and sang improvised songs about him. Then suddenly the
young brave who led them leaped forward and made a speech, and said
that their brother was welcome, but he must prove that he was fit to rank
With the braves of the nation. Then, with shrieks and howls, they led
him to the hooks, and he was pressed to undergo the ordeal and assert
his manhood.
At that the Weasel trembled and shook. Not all his studies, nor the
teachings of the East, could make him a mate for white people, fit to In
termarry with them, but they had indeed succeeded in killing the savage

TRYING TO MAKE SAN FRANCISCO ONE OF THE FINEST CITIES IN THE WORLD.
Officers and Directors Express Their
Views as to the Best Way of Im
proving and Beautifying the City.
THE Merchants' Association was
born April 5, 1894, and is there
fore less than five years old. But
it has never had any childhood.
It sprang full grow./, and thor
oughly equipped for its arduous task.
There were just forty-seven business
den at that first meeting. They were
very enthusiastic and hopeful. But it
was enthusiasm tempered by clear
prained common sense, and hope that
could not be crushed out by repeated
failure.
Bit by bit they piled up a founda
tion upon which the association could
rest secure. At the beginning they
adopted certain cardinal principles.
They determined first that party poli
tics should be strictly excluded from
its proceedings. The influence of the
association must be constantly exerted
In measures of public interest, but no
part must be taken in party politics or
political patronage.
The Merchants' Association must no*
resort to personal abuse or vitupera
-1 Whenever possible, it must co-operaU
with public officials in carrying out all
ordinances and laws for the comfort,
safety, health and prosperity of the
community.
Its relations with the press must bÂ«
of the most cordial and candid nature.
In its reforms it must not aim far
above or far below the mark. The worst
afflictions of municipalities are ordin
ary ones, and should be handled and
treated in an ordinary manner.
Before attempting any change or im
provement the association must ascer
tain carefully whether the proposed
work is feasible and the contemplated
plan of action practicable.
These cardinal principles the mem
bora felt would ultimately mean sue-

' But it is neither this fact nor their
long membership roll which has com
mand.<i the respect and gratitude of
the entire community.
It is because they do necessary
things not dream them all day long.
They first earned their spurs by
sweeping the streets of San Francisco.
And they did it so well that even the
"I told you so" of the wiseacres did not
drown the chorus of thanks that ech

were a source of caricature abroad and
discomfort at home.
The association determined as its In
itial effort to correct this glaring evil.
By offering an extremely low bid the
Supervisors awarded the contract to
the Merchants' Association. The 580.
--000 appropriated annually for cleaning
the streets proved inadequate to do the
work properly and thoroughly.
The Merchants' Association, there
fore, raised $30,000 by voluntary sub
scriptions from merchants and prop
erty owners. This sum, added to the
city appropriation, enabled the associa
tion to execute the contract success
fully durinr a period of eight months.
This practical experiment proved so
satisfactory that plans and specifica
tions for perpetuating the system were
carefully prepared and submitted to the
city authorities. The Board of Super
visors approved the system, and has
repeatedly adopted it. To-day the
streets of San Francisco are swept and
cleaned according to these specifica
tions, and under the constant supervi
sion of the association. To venture
forth into the streets is no longer a
plunge into a dust bath.
This feat placed the association In a
determined niche In the body politic.
It proved that this organization, com
posed almost entirely of members of
business firms, could not be overlooked.
Its members employ in the aggregate at
least 15,000 persons and represent about
one-half the assessed property in this
city. Comparatively speaking the
Merchants' Association is now numeri
cally stronger than any other commer
cial organization In the United States.
Having proved their power for public
good they did not rest on their laurels.
They next aimed a timely and well
directed blow at the cobblestones. The
street pavements have long been a
municipal nuisance. We never mention
thorn, even in whispers, outside of our
boundaries. A loyal San Franciscan
may casually hint at an occasional fog,
but to breathe of our antediluvian
pavements taboos him as a traitor.
All the sweeping in the world cannot
make the cobblestones aught but an
eyesore to the artistic and an Irritant to
corns.
Under the law the city must keep ac
cepted streets only In needed repair.
Any repavement must be provided by
the adjacent property owners. The
Merchants' Association, by strenuous
efforts, finally succeeded in securing
sufficient voluntary subscriptions from
property owners to repave some of the
principal blocks of the city.
The smooth modern pavement that
now makes Market street a thorough
fare worthy of a progressive city is due
entirely to the efforts of the Merchants'
AFPociation.
The next nuisance upon which the
association frowned was municipal
moonlight. Turning out the city lights
on calendar moonlight benefited no one
Bave the footpad. As the city was
bound to this system by a two years'
contract nothing could be done speedily
to make an official change. .
Fully realizing the benefit of a mod
ern method of publio lighting, the
Merchants' Association resolved to give
San Francisco another object lesson.
Voluntary subscriptions therefore were
again solicited for the placing of arc
lights upon a few principal business
streets.
The idea at once became contagious
and other streets asked the privilege of
Joining the movement. Subscriptions'
amounting to $15,000 were quickly
signed, and 228 powerful electric arc
lights of 2000 candle power each were
suspended along the center of the main
thoroughfares of the city.
This experiment has been so suc
cessful that this Improved system of
street lighting has now been \ perma
nently adopted by the municipality.
Electric lights will soon be strune
throughout the city, and ; San Francis
co will be one the best illuminated
cities in the United States.

worked for the successful establish

University of California. Following

F. W. DOHRMANN-Now that the
new charter is adopted it becomes the
duty of those who worked and voted for
it to see that the opportunities for im
proving our municipal conditions under

To my mind it is of little consequence

favor the re-election of all who now
hold offices if they perform their duties
during the present year satisfactorily.
My reasons are:
Firstâ That duty well performed
should always be appreciated and re
warded by re-election.
Secondâ That the experience gained
during the present term is of value to
the city and will enable them to give
better service than inexperienced men
could do.
Thirdâ That such officers are entitled
to preference since the charter will cut
short the term for which they were
elected last fall.
Outside of this and particularly for
the new offices such as Board of Public
Works and Civil Service Commission,
I favor selection of perfectly compe
tent, honest and reliable men without
regard to politics, as one of the prin
cipal purposes of the new charter is to
take the municipal government out of
party politics and thereby secure us a
business management of the business
affairs of our city.
I favor the thorough study, of, full

preparation for and careful execution
of. the civil service measure provided
in the charter. This feature, more than
anything else in it, will bring about
a pure, effective municipal administra
tion.
I advise that the Merchants' Associa
tion appoint committees of competent
men, familiar with our conditions and
surroundings, to study the material
wants of our city, to meet together and
discuss the recommendations of the
separate committees and then prepare
a municipal programme as to sewers,
streets, hospitals, public buildings,
schools, fire and other protection and
other public necessities, figuring up
probable cost, estimate our resources
and income, and what can be covered
by taxation or what should be paid for
by bonding, and thus prepare an e.CQÂ»
nomical but progressive plan for mak
ing our city an economical, well-gov
erned, modern, progressive community.
Such a platform, together with the
recommendations of Mrs. HearÃt's com
mittee for beautifying the city, so far
as they can be financially and practi
cally carried out, would give us a muni
cipal policy which once approved and
adopted by the people should be con
stantly followed by our Boards of Su
pervisors and other officers for years
to come and until new issues arise
which require changes and additions.
If this is done I believe San Francisco
will enter upon an era of growth, im
provements and prosperity beyond the
expectation of Its most patriotic well
wishers and inhabitants.

A. S. BALDWlNâ Firstâ Make City
Hall avenue 300 feet wide. Do this by
condemning 100 feet of the Market
street frontage on each side of the ave
nue and convert each piece into a small
park. This will cost probably $750,
--000.
Secondâ Extend the paxk panhandle
to Market street and Van Ness avenue
and acquire the seven blocks north of
the park between Thirteenth and Four
teenth avenues, as already proposed by
the Mayor and Supervisors, at a cost
perhaps of $3,500,000.
Third â Construct new school build
ings and put those now built in a good
and sanitary condition; allow about
$750,000.
Fourth â Condemn the lands owned by
the Sutro estate which are planted in
trees, commencing Just south or the Af
filiated Colleges and extending to In
gleside. Construct roads and maintain
the property as a forest park. I pre
sume the area would be about 800 acres
and imagine the value would not exceed
$1,500,000.
Fifth â Construct one main sewer
from Ocean View to the bay, to drain
about 2000 acres, at a cost of about
$400,000.
Sixthâ Establish a municipal lighting
plant, as proposed by the Supervisors.
This probably would not involve an
outlay of more than $600,000. Making a
total of about $7,500,000.
With another million dollars added
for the improvement of the new parks
and. drives, San Francisco could be
made one of the most attractive cities
in the world. The new charter should
be amended as to the provision relat
ing to parks and boulevards. The max
imum appropriation allowed under it is
7 cents on each hundred dollars. This
would only produce about $250,000 per
annum, about one-half cf what the an
nual appropriation should be.
â¢ â¢ â¢
WALLACE BRADFORDâ I should
liTce to see this city one of the most
beautiful ones in the world. With our
climate and natural advantages there
is no reason why it should not be. If
the park be extended to "Van Ness ave
nue and a boulevard made of that
street we will then have a beautiful
driveway that the citizens will be proud
of. The Merchants' Association will
certainly not leave a stone unturned to
make this not only the Queen City of
the Golden State, but one that can fa
vorably compare to any other in the
world.
Believing that San Francisco Is Just
beginning a decade of prosperity which
will astonish the people of our entire
country, and being an enthusiastic pe
liever in the idea that San Francisco is
destined to be the second largest city
in the United States, I believe that
when the new charter comes into oper

less than $100,000,000 bonds to be used
in the immediate improvement of our
city.

MARSHAL HALEâ The Merchants'
Association of San Francisco has done
a great deal toward developing our city.
It has aided the city government in
many ways. But there is a greater
field for U3. The Merchants' Associa
tions of New York and Chicago have
reached out to bring trade to their re
spective cities. The future development
of the Hawaiian Islands and the Philip
pines will open great possibilities
whether we hold our new possessions
or not. If we can turn the tide of trade
toward San Francisco and develop the
commerce of the Pacific Ocean with the
United States through the Golden Gate
wo will accomplish a great thing. Let
us make San Francisco the center of
the Pacific Ocean trade as New York
Is the center of the Atlantic Ocean
trade. We can then develop a city
second only to New York.
GEORGE LIEBESâ The new charter
limits the borrowing capacity of the
city to fifteen (15) per cent of the as
sessed valuation of the property; con
sequently the necessity of discreet and
systematic expenditures of all money
is apparent.
Before any municipal improvement is
commenced it should be well consid
ered as to the part it shall fill as to
ward the completed whole. If we have
no programme or plan to start with, we
are liable to find a most hodge-podge
arrangement at the completion of any
individual improvement, hence the first
necessity of our city is to decide upon
all the improvements needed, and then
to select that which is needed most, that
it may be first accomplished.

JOSEPH D. GRANTâ Every seaside
city and town in Europe that sprinkles
the streets at ell uses sea water for
that purpose. Salt -water does not dry
bo quickly as fresh water.
It binds the dirt together between the
paving stones, so that no loose dirt is
raised by the wind.
It absorbs moisture from the air dur
ing the night, so that in the morning
the street has the appearance of being
freshly watered.
No injurious effects have been no
ticed on the cements and metals In the
sewers.
Salt water has no detrimental effect
on good bituminous pavement.
Why, then, should not the city of
San Francisco use salt water for
sprinkling the streets?

HUGO ROTHSCHILD â While the
Merchants' Association does not lose
sight of the immediate wants and im

will be it also looks forward to the
future. One of the main ambitions ac
cording to my idea of this common
wealth should be the acquisition of our
own gas and electric plants and of
water works of sufficient capacity for
all purposes for a large city. As water
Is necessary for the existence of every
living being the dispensing of the same

But I firmly hold it is the duty of the

who would have sufficient influence at

method of law making 1 was reversed.
The Merchants' Association called upon
the citizens of San Francisco to create
as well as ratify the charter. Its three
cardinal principles of homo rule, eco

vice are the natural product of the
heart and brain of the voters of the

JOSEPH BRITTONâ San Francisco
has through long years run under a
grovernment that was good when
formed by the enactment of the con

stitution was made had become de
moralized by acts of the Legislature
procured by political spoilsmen. The
framers of the new constitution, seeing
this drift of legislative acts to make a
prey of San Francisco, put a clause in
the ccnstitution giving us the right to
frame a charter for our self-govern
ment. This advantage is now extended
to almost all cities of any size. We have
been fighting long to avail ourselves
of this privilege, and at last, after sev
eral failures, have succeeded in adopt
ing a charter which sweeps out of ex
istence all those laws and customs by
which bosses live. StilJ we have not
killed the bosses, nor can we. Vice al
ways lives in large communities and

expenditure of a like energy that won
the charter San Francisco will have a
great and noble government, and her
people will rise to a high political plane.

The members tiptoed in and out, as <

There had already been heavy losses.

card it will be nearer to the 5 top or
nearer to one corner than another. \ n
this way, all playing cards, no matter
what the patterns of their backs may
be, are divisible Into two sets, bai ii
with an easily distinguished character.
By patiently sorting hundreds of packs,
Chopard produced a numb -r of packs'
suited to bis purpose. The backs of |
the eights and nines had always an ir
regularity. The backs of all the others
were perfectly regular. Thus, without
putting so much as a scratch or erasure
111 L 'V ~~ lA I B
I on a card, his cards were marked ef
i fectually.
It is admittedly the most subtle fraud
at baccarat. The banker has the cards
in his hands. If the first card, that on
<Â§>$> â¦ <Â£â¢ <B><S> <S> $> <Â§> <$> <S> <S> <S> <$>
top, is a nine, the chances of the right-
I hand group of players, to whom he
should deal it, are remarkably aug
mented by the fact. For suppose the
second card given them turns out to bt;
a ten, a jack, a queen or a king, the
right-hand group will call â¢'nine" and
win. It is true that the banker may
also have a nine, but the chances are
immensely the other way. Without
going Into the mathematics of the thing
it will be sufficient to say that the
knowledge of where the eights and
nines are coming, just before each turn,
is equal to a rebate of 20 per cent at
the game of baccarat. Of course this
advantage is all against the bank. It
appears that Chopard was willing it
should be so. When he banked he lost
as much as he won. But the beauty of
it was that the large winners were most
always his confederates. They were
I lucky young fellows, as they thought,
j while winning. Now they are wander
ers with ruined reputations. Chopard
kept a strict account with them. He
took the lion's share of their wicked
gains.
When Chopard entered there was al
ways a great stir. His influence was
always in favor of high play. Rich
men, who would have been quite as
content with smaller stakes, were
drawn into higher play by his example.
An honest man would be dealing. The
sharper would cell out "Five hundred I
marks on the left!" He had an even |
chance to win or lose. When he saw
v. hat nobody else could see â a nine on
top â he would lay down 2000 marks
upon the right.
The men he played against were not
simpletons. Chopard has been tailed
the king of card manipulators. This is
true, for there is no trick in the hand
ling of a pack he has not at his finger
ends. His success is, however, still due
more to his diplomacy. How to win two
large bets in every three and yet not
be suspected was his triumph. When I
he and his confederates had broken up |
a bank Chopard might then take a
bank himself. He had the same chance !
to win as any other banker. Little by |
little his confederates would draw the
money out when they could see a lucky
nine on top the pack. "Yes, Chopard
won enormously," the crowd would say
the next day, â¢'but he lost it all with
the next bank he took."
The interest in society now centers in
the fate of the accomplices of Chopard.
â¢ of them â young men of good
family â are in flight. It is whispered
there are others trembling to-day upon
the verge of suicide. One of those who
i had helped to Introduce Chopard into
the club is now branded as a known
BWindler. As he is far away they do
| not hesitate to give his story in full.

This affair of the "Prinzen-jeu" was

disappeared to make a short tour of the

TWO FAMOUS STRUGGLES FOR CHAMPIONSHIPS.
HARDEST FIGHT
I Ever Had.
By FraoK Eroe.
Risiog Middle- Weight
WHENEVER a man or a woman obtains in this world .that prominence or distinction in any particular line
or profession which wins fame and renown, the word of that man or woman becomes of value By rleht
of their prowess or iitness, whichever you choose to term it, they have the privilege to speak 'and their
words are as truth. Last week there arrived here Frank Erne, who some say will be the champion light
weight fighter of this country, and Jimmy Michael, who at middle distances on the bicycle can ride
faster than any man in the business. Erne comes here to "fight Dal Hawkins, while Michael will demonstrate in
the bicycle tournament shortly to be held here that he has no equal. In their particular lines they have no supe
riors. They have won and kept their laurels by sheer right of their prowess
When I called on them last week at the Palace, I was most affably 'received. Michael I found to be a wee
specimen of humanity no larger than a pin. but a manly little fellow, while the modesty of Erne was his most
striking characteristic. Following is what they have to say of the hardest contests they ever had in their respective
THÂ£ hardest fight that I ever hard in
my life was with Jack Skelly. As
everybody knows, Skelly was a fight
er of no mean ability in his day. It
will he recalled by those who are well
posted in the history of the ring that it
was Skelly who fought George Dlxon in
X*-w Orleans at the time that Corbett
ended the career of John L. Sullivan. At
that famous carnival Skr-Uy pave Dixon
a clean, hard and scientific argument, and
the little negro had all ho wanted to win
his victory. Well, I was matched to meet
Skelly in 1893 for ten rounds and a decis
ion In the light weight class. I had heard
a good deal of Bkelly and his prowness as
a lighter, but I guess, like all youngsters,
I had a case of the swelled head and I
did not reckon on any especial trouble in
disposing of my game. I knew that I
had a li^ht on my hands, but I thought
that in two rounds 1 would be able to
finish my man. 1 want you to understand
that this fight taught mo a lesson. Be
lieving that 1 haÂ«i my man easy I .lid not
half train, so that when I entered tho
ring on the night of the fight I was not
really in the condition that I should have
1m .11.
I shall never forget it. Tim Hurst was
the referee, in the betting 1 was a 3 to 1
favorite and I have since understood that
there were few takers even at that price
on Skelly. 1 had given my friends t lie quiet
tip that I would finish Skelly In the sec
ond or third round, and I honestly ex
pected to <l't BO; but, as you will see, I
had underestimated my game.
When time wan railed [ sailed in. My
plan of action was to go right at my man
and never give him a moment's rest. I
wanted to make riuiek work of him and
end ih" H^ht. This was about the way I
had sized it up, but there was something
I hart faik-fl to count on and that wan the
cleverness and staying powers of Skelly.
I went at my man in the first round, but
he- was not there. I chased him. but he
kept out of the way. This nettled me, so
in the next round I was hot. I rushed
him hard, but I could not reach Skelly,
and what was worse-, I got badly punished
for my trouble. The third round saw me
with a badly swollen eye. I want to tell
you that in all my experience in the ring
I was never so badly punished as in this
fight. My left eye was lying out on my
cheek, my lips were cut and swollen,

who holds the record with sixty-three

while the blood was running from my
nose in such a stream that I could hardly
breathe.
In a very little while I realized that I
was up against It. I had started the rush
ing tactics and I knew that I hud to keep
it up or lose the fight, as Skelly had out
pointed me. I was aware that if I altered
my game the public would say that Skel
ly had made it so warm for me that 1 had
to quit. You can imagine my feelings
when I tell you that as I came up for
each round I knew that I was getting
weaker, while, as far as I could see there
was no let-up on Skelly's part. He showed
up fresh and appeared to be getting
stronger as the game wpnt on. I was des
perate. I knew wiiat defeat meant, and I
summoned all of my strength to my aid
For the first time in my life I realized
the hitter meaning of the word "overcon
fident," and I resolved that 1 would never
ugain underestimate my man.
This was how the fight stood up to the
beginning of the seventh round. When
this round opened I knew that If I was
to Win I had to get to work. Skelly
seemed strong, and, let me tell you, he
was showing lots of cleverness. He came
at me like a whirlwind. He punished me
worse than I had ever been punished in
my life, before or since. I felt that vic
tory was slipping from my grasp. I was
wild. I was mad. In fact, I felt that the
end of my life had come. In my despera
tion I summoned to my aid all of my
strength. I went at Skelly and. for some
reason, he allowed himself to be drawn
or rushed into his corner. I saw my one
opportunityâ indeed, my last opportunity.
I femted for Skelly's stomach. This was
his weak point. When I marie thf feint
he lowered bis guard and in an Instant
I shot my right to his chin. I threw the
weight of my whole body Into the blow.
He went down like an ox. As he tried to
rise I put him out.
I did not get over the effects of my
punishment for a month, but the fight
was of great benfit to me. as it has
taught me the lesson that a man should
never underestimate his opponent.

By "Jirrjroy" Michael,
Champion Middle-Distance f^ider.
THE hardest middle distance race
that I ever rodo was with Tom Lin
ton on the Manhattan Beach track.
In my humble estimation it was the
hardest race ever run in thi.s or any
other country. Mv reasons for saying this
are not a few. There were .many condi
tions that made the race a hard one. To
me the purse was no consideration. To
begin with, there was between Linton and
myself the keenest rivalry; such ri
valry, in fact, that either of us would
have given all he possessed In the world
if any one could have satisfied him be
fore the race that he would win. Back
of the rivalry of which I speak is a story,
and it la a story that will explain why
the race was the hardest 1 ever rode.
Tom Linton and I were schoolmates. We
were born and brought up in thr> same
town. It was in Aberanien, Aberdare,
South Wales, that we lived. Our homes
were not a quarter of a mile apart. There
had existed between Linton and myself
a rivalry from the time when wo were
little boys. As we grew up and wore able
to take part in sports and games this
spirit of rivalry grew stronger. This was
the state of affairs between Linton and
myself in 1891, when we both took to the
wheel.
Then it was that the fight became
harder for me. This -was due to the
difference in our occupations. Linton was
a miner, while I was learning to be a
butcher. Naturally my rival had the
greater following. The miners in the
town greatly outnumbered tin- butchers,
and they stood by Linton lo a man
through all his ups and downs. During
the first few years our greatest ambition
was to defeat each other. When we
finally branched out as full-fledged pro
fessionals. I believe that cither of us
would rather be beaten a dozen times by
any one else than by the other.
In 1595 under the management of
Choppy Warburton, the famous runner,
I gained many %-ictories in Paris and
other parts of the world, among them
being eight victories over Tom Linton, who
always had some plausible excuse to give
for his defeat. It was in Paris that I met
Champion Zimmerman, and it was from
Shot the Spanish Officer Sent to Arrest
Him and Appealed to the .Native Sol
diers to 'Strike fop Freedom.
than 1200 francs a year, and the elder
Aguinaldo had great difficulty to make
buth ends meet.
At St. Jean de Lateran the student is
drilled in Spanish and Latin and the
him that I learned how good the Ameri
can riders were and how much harder
the game was In this country than in Eu
rope. In 1596. when Johnson, McDonald
and Weinig visited Europe, I met them,
and it was then that I decided to come
to America.
On my leaving Europe Llnton at once
started the report that I Had crossed the
pond to avoid meeting him. You can run
over my records of that year. I raced
until late in the fall, and I placed many
records to the credit of the New Orleans
track. After such a long strain of hard
work I thought I was entitled to a rest.
It was just at this time tfiat the six days'
race, which was managed by Kennedy,
Brady and Powers, began In New 'i ork.
Llnton, with Teddy Hale, the wjnner of
the race, and many other noted bicyclists,
came to this country under the manage
ment of Plummer to participate in the
race. Well, just as bad luck would have
it, I had to go to England, being sud
denly called there to appear in a case
which was in the courts at that 'time.
I had to go to exonerate a friend of mine
from damaging blame that had been laid
at his door as the result of an accident
to us while training with a triplet on a
road in England.
Of course, just as soon as I left Linton
at once began to say that he had driven
me from Europe and that he had also
driven me from America because I was
afraid to meet him. You can imagine
how I felt when I knew what a false
game he was playing. Just to show you
how he was bluffing, Linton met defeat
at the hands of J. F. Starbuck, the Phil
adelphia crack middle distance' man. In
]Sfi7 I.inton failed to show up in this coun
try, but last year the desire again to
meet his old s< hoolmate was so strong in
him that he came to this country to meet
me. I met him and McDuffie. In the
race with the latter at Boston my han
dle-bar broke, and. of course. I was de
feated. My hard luck kept with me. for
when I met Linton I punctured a tire and
he won a victory. These two victories
were so hollow that unnther race was ue
manded, which resulted in a victory for
me.
Now to sum up my story, for I am go
ing to tell you of the last, final and great
race. You will understand what were my |
feelings when I entered the race. As I !
have pp. id. 1 was to meet Linton at the
Manhattan Beach track. The conditions
of the rai c were of the hardest kind. To
begin with, you know the state of my
feelings. Now the Manhattan Beach I
track is one of the most difficult on which \
to break records nr follow pacemakers,
because of the sharp turns which will al
most unseat a rider. Then, again, there
is the stiff breeze from the ocean that
you have to ride against. This in itself
is enough to discourage a man.
Well, we started from the opposite ends i
of the track. We were each to have un- ;
limited pacing, and let me tell you that I
the machines used were quintets. You
can have some Idea nf the race from this
fact alone. It was a hard race. At the
crack of the pistol -ecords began to fall
by the wayside. New. taking the track j
into consideration, to say nothing of our j
intense desire to defeat each other, you '
can readily see how little it would take
to lose the ra^e. Owing to the immense i
crowd that thronged the course T was j
unable at any time to locate Linton. I !
knew what to do. so I got down to steady
riding in a hurry. 1 never once let my
self entirely out. This la a rule that 1
always observe, for when your opponent
gets "too close to you if you have not any
extra steam you are lest.
Well, we both went at it determined to
do or die. Only once during the race did
Linton get within eighty yards of me. I
won ihe race, and the victory was dear
and sweet, but I had to work for it. and
I want to say right here that it was the
hardest race that I ever rode.

Thomas. This, like the college, ia under
the Dominicans. In the university the
principal studies are physics, meta
-1 physics, theology, jurisprudence, law and
> medicine.
> Aguinaldo was adjudged a very dull
, student and gave no promise of distir.c-
( tion. In fact, the Dominicans finally Bent
him home in sheer despair. AguinaMo
' then entered the normal school of the
â¢ Jesuits. Here he made some progress;
. but at this time his father died, when tha
, youth was forced to return home to take
care of his patrimony, which was threat
ened by the lawsuits instituted by the
' Order of the Recollectosâ an organization
â¢ composed of the greatest land proprietors
> of the colony.
, It waa in 1893 that Dr. Rizal created the
i Philippine League, the object of which
was to unite politically the various parts
'of the archipelago. Rizal was banished.
> but shortly afterward the order of Kati
( pu nan was formed, which soon had more
than 200,000 members. The object of this
, society was co-operation for the protec
tion of the colonists.
The Government then, fearing an alll
â¢ ance of this society with the Free Masons
, and the various secret orders hostile to
Spanish rule, began to take active meas
â  ures against it. Aguinaldo was suspected
.of being one of the leaders. A Spanish
officer, with a SQuad of native soldiers,
came to arrest him. Aguinaldo, when
â  confronted by the officer, promptly shot
, him. then eloquently appealed to his com
panions to leave the service of their for
â¢ eign oppressors and strike a blow for
. liberty.
The soldiers received his words with ac
claim and instantly chose him as their
leader. He then sought the fastnesses
of the forest, where he was soon joined
by thousands of his countrymen â all
flaming to join the standard of revolt.
, Aguinaldo is short of sature, with a
well knit figure. He has the Japanese
cast of face and wears a black pompa
dour, which heightens that impression;
his countenance is imperturbable; it is
notable for its serious expression. During
the rebellion he was in hourly fear of as
sassination a reward of $25,000 had been
offered by the Spaniards for his head, and
this prize had brought into his camp a
host of mercenaries seeking a convenient
opportunity to gain the coveted reward.
He has unbounded influence with his own
â¢ countrymen, and no one betrayed him or
attempted to make an assault upon his
life for the reward.
â¢ The headquarters of Aguinaldo were in
, the former house of a rich native of Ca
vite. With him were his staff and his
' mother and several of his relatives. These
> he kept with him to secure them from
Spanish vengeance. In front of the broad,
' roomy house, is a paved court, and on
> each side a trusted number of stalwart
, Insurgents constantly keep guard. The
' uniform of these soldiers ip a cheap na
âº-iti'e homespun; their arms are of the
k crudest description; but they made up In
loyalty what they lacked in training.
âº" The general himself usually wore a spot
> less- suit of white linen, a white shirt, with
a well-polished front, a high collar and
' a black necktie. He wore red velvet slip
. pers, embroidered In gold. In his office
was a modern desk, piled high with docu
ments, a large mirror, two large, strong
1 iron boxes, which served as a safe for the
moneys of the insurgent government, and
a grand piano of Spanish make. Against
a. hatrack leaned the rebel standard, and
on the wall hung a map of the province.
This the general used to scan eagerly,
tracing the movements and disposition of
his troops.
Aguinaldo was usually surrounded by
various members of his staff, none of
whom, however, was as impressive as
himself. I believe Aguinaldo to be sincere
and patriotic. He has surely proved him
self an able general. He Is bravely per
sonified, and inasmuch as the Filipinos
admire this above all other attributes,
Agufnaldo is always at the head. He is a
born leader, and has just enough tact to
adopt expediencies and make compro
mises, yet he does not seem to do so.
In everything he takes the initiative.
In no event does he consult any one. He
brooks no opposition. He has had no
rivals In reality. There have been one or
two would-be ones, but they could not
withstand him. He- is perhaps not alwayÃ
scrupulous as to the attainment of his
ends, yet his proclamations are wise and
moderate, his conduct all one would desire
In even a European dictator. Moreover,
few have shown themselves so modest
and so merciful.
Thrro is a tremendous magnetism about
the man, and whenever he addresses his
troops he holds them with a grip that
would be spellbound but for the rapt at
tention and for the devotion that is vo
ciferously manifested. The natives, too.
seem to be unable as well as unwilling to
get away from his power, and. to all ap
pearance, he is to the islanders the man
of the hour.
Of course. I do not agree with him in
everything ho does. but. knowing his sin
cerity and believing that he makes his
spectacular display merely to impress the
natives and hold their allegiance. I there
fore admire him, and hope that the
Americans will co-operate with him to
give us a stable Philippine government.
At all events, the man's strong person
ality and his large following cannot, I
believe, well be ignored by the American
Government.

With them. Only once did he let anger
pet the better of him. That was when a
sturdy priest tried to prevent him from
plundering his home. Viola would not
stand that, and so he promptly slew the
unfortunate priest.
Viola's great desire at present is to
form a partnership with another bandit
named Raimondo Pare, for whom the
police arc also looking. These two men
are well known throughout the district
of Aquila. and many think that for that
very reason the authorities ought to be
able to capture them easily. Viola how
ever, has many friends and relatives
there, and whenever the police or soldiers
show themselves these loyal fellows
promptly send word to the bandits and
thus enable them to get into a safe hiding
place. B
As a matter of fact, too, the number of
policemen in the district is entirely in

other brigands do pretty much as they

GOSSIP OF A SOCIETY BUD
DEAREST MARGUERITE: E'en
your failings lean to virtue's side.
What a loyal little girl you are,
and liqw straight from the shoul
der you can administer a scolding.
But, I like you all the better, for It proves
you would put on the gloves for me.
However. 1 plead not guilty to your
charges. You know lam as fond of Flora
Dean as you are. I knew you would bo
interested in hearing even of her reported
engagement, and as for the rest of It, 1
â¢Imply meant that she has a nalvo uncon
ventional way of putting things. It is
very refreshing in this age and generation
of mediocrity.
I have always said that Flora was head
and shoulders above any of the other
"'West" girls and 1 am still perfectly will
ing to take off my rhapeau to her.
Have I reinstated myself in your good
graces? You say my apologies arc simply
egotism wrong side out, but on this oc
casion I have tried to bow the head and
bend the knee with better grace.
The great problem, more difficult than
that propounded by the Sphynx ol old,
has, at last been answered. With due
deliberation the chaperons have decided
that we. who know more about a chup
alone. may Â«o to the Mardi Gras.
At first things did not seem to come our
way. The matrons and brides announced
their Intention of going and then with
tantalizing slowness dallied with the
pros and cons of the buds and belles ap
pearing. But I believe it is now settled
that WÂ« may go.
Mrs. Magee and Mrs. Tobin are going to
chaperon a ha.f dozen of us. we are
nil going in costume and it Is proving a
severe .strain on our gray mutter. ;is weil
as our purses to evolve something new
and original to wear. All the details have
been settled and the King. Queen and
Jester have been chosen. I have been let
Into the secret of their identity. but I gave
Mr. Greenway a "cross my heart and hope
to die" promise that I would not tel'..
So until he absolves me it is silence a la
mort.
1 have been devoting all my spare think
ing moments for the benefit of the Chil
dren's Hospital. W<; are going to give a
bazaar on the 11th and we want it to be
an overwhelming success. Mrs. Hobart
has offered us her house for thf occasion
with permission to turn it upside down,
from garret to cellar. Lottie Cunning
ham and I are cultivating wrinkles In
the endeavor to make ourselves useful.
There is plenty to do, for there are 130
children to be trained for the Mother
Goose entertainment, besides all the other
details. Mrs. Richardson and Mr. Bruce
Porter are going to pose the tableau.

sent us some very valuable suggestions.
And both of her daughters are aiding us
and will take charge of one of the booths.
I am so interested in this and in the
bal masque that I have forgotten to com
plain at the dearth of all things social.
A significant hoarse croak in my voice
was taken by the mater as a note of
warning from the "grip"' and she refused
to let me go to the Friday Fortnightly,
which was the only offering laid at the
feet of Terpsichore this week.
Colds or a bona fide attack of the grip
kept one or two other girls away, but
despite our absence all went merry. Dick
says the girls looked particularly pretty.
Monday night I went to the theater. We
are becoming regular first-nighters. The
boys all accepted with alacrity our in
vitation to see Daniels. The fact that
he has a lady fair in the company who is
guaranteed to make the heart of a club
Johnny do a two-step Is not lost upon us.
Miss Merrill was m the party and she
amused us at supper afterward with some
vi'i-y droll Btorlea of tlic way we Califor
nians are regarded outside of the State
limits.
Wednesday night Bishop ;;nd Mrs.
Nichols Rave a reception to Bishop More
land. Every one was there who recog
nizes the peal "f a church bell, and there
were others whose unbounding faith in
getting to heaven anew through the eye
of a needle Is not so great. It was really
not a very solemn affairâ due, probably,
to the excellence of the light refresh-
ments. . .
Jean and Florence Hush called yester
day. They told me all about the Kitt
redge reception and dinnerâ a very swell
affair. The girls say things are very live
ly over in Oaklandâ and they indignantly
refute the assertion that the strength of
the cotillon punch has anything to do
with it.
Oh. yes; I forgot to tell you that faro
Crockett gave us a dinner. Caro Intended

though she has given us several dinners

Crocked was quito ill. so of course C*t*O

nurse's cap. When Mrs. Crockett was
well. Caro declared that even if unaided
and abetted she would, tinge this winter
with at least a touch of the gayety that
has enlivened former seasons.
Then poor Mrs. Hopkins became sud
denly so very ill. and that has deprived
us not only of the Hopkins girls, but of
Caro as well. Both Helen and Edna
Hopkins axe simply devoted to Caxo, and

one writer, but many. There was Bab,
gay, , brilliant, light-hearted Bab, be
neath whose most mocking sallies of wit
one could detect the true, sweet womanli
ness of the generous hearted writer. Then
there was Ruth Ashmore, the discreet and
tactful gentlewoman who wrote enter
taining axioms for the guidance of uncer
tain girlhood, standing, more diffident
than reluctant, at the half open door,
which means the step from childhood to
womanhood, wondering, with all the self
cgnsciousneas of youth, just how this step
might be most gracefully accomplished.
Thousands of young girls in America con
sidered Ruth Ashmore the last court of
appeal in mooted questions of etiquette
and propriety. In the role of an author
ity on fashion Mrs. Mallon had atill a
third audience, with an occasional one un
der her own name for short stories of fic
tion.
Her death, while a surprise to the out
side world, was not altogether unexpect
ed. For some months Mrs. Mallon'3
health had been bad. Her mother, to
whom the daughter had always been de
voted and who for many years had been
her constant companion and friend, diol
in October. This preyed on the mind of
the gifted, high-strung- woman and made
the conquest of disease an easy matter.
She died the day after the Christmas hol
iday. December 27. Once Bab said:
"After all, we Southern women don't
know very much, anyhow, except how to
love and be loyal to what we low."
Mrs. Mallon was a native of the pictur
esque city of Baltimore, whose boast it ts
that all its women are beautiful and all
its men brave and chivalrous. Her mother
belonged to one of the most distinguished
families of Delaware, and her father's
people, the Sloans, for live generations
had occupied the old mansion in which
the writer was born.
The little Isabel had every advantase
which wealth could give her, fashionable
governesses and masters. When *he was
little more than a child she married Will
iam Mallon. a good looking: young Irish
man of fine family and prospects. Ever
since she was 12 years old she had known
him. and the match met with the entire
approhation of both families, with th<?
single objection to the youthful years of
the bride. She was 16 and Mr. Mallon waa
seven years her senior.
After the wedding they went abroad and
several yours were spent in travel. On
their return they made their home in New
York city. Unfortunately Mr. Mallon was
not strong, and after a few years con
sumption began to make fatal inroads on
his health. With this came financial dis
aster, and the young woman who had
never known what it meant to have a
spoken wish ungratiried found herself
with an invalid husband and no means of
support.
She made an effort 10 secure employ
ment. The daughters of luxury do not
often bring marketable wares into the
business world, but she was an exception.
The manager of a great publishing house
to whom she applied was struck by her
courage and sincerity.
"What can you do?" he asked.
"Anything,"" she replied, choking back
a sob; "scrub your floor, if you've noth
ing bettor for me t<> do!"
The publisher thought the matter over.
He had a man to scrub his floors, and
while he did not doubt the will of the
Blender, pale-faced young woman who
stood before him he much doubted her
physical ability to keep his floors Ammac
ulate. So he snid doubtfully:
"Do you think you could write fash
ions?"
She thought she could, and was engaged
at a salary of $10 a week. She worked
nine hours a day at a dingy desk in a
dingy office, and was glad of the chance
because it enabled her to make her hus
band's descent to the grave a little easier.
For three years she worked thus, and in
that period her salary was raised a num
ber, of times. . â¢
In her position she made the acquaint
ance of other writers, and some of these
advised her to contribute to other papers
in addition to her modest work for the
great pattern publishing firm.

And that can be taken as a keynof to
the rest of the wardrobe. They bought
dimities and organdies when the dealers
wore getting ready to put away their
Bummer goods and were displaying furs.
They bought olrgant heavy materi.il for
a winter gown when airy chiffons were

A great many of the new organdies and
dimities show the "Dolly Varden" pat
tern. This;, the shopkeeper assured me,
!s going to be the favorite pattern in
summer materials. Flower designs seem
to have entirely displaced the dainty
stripes and plaids of last season. Won
drously beautiful are some of the blos
soms that trail in exquisite colorings over
a dainty but contrasting background.
Then there nre some so dazzling in their
color scheme that the person v.ho la
color blind has the best of his loss for
tunate neighbor. Brilliant carmine, burnt
ornr;ee. sapphire and castor are spilled
together on a shrimp pink background!
However, so little of the foundation color
shows and the other shades are so

a distance. We shall probably even
l.je.tn to gaze upon it at closer view with

The shirt waist comes with tfee spring
as purely as the swallows homeward fly.
The new models differ somewhat from
their sisters of a summer ago. There are
B">me very mannish ones, closely enough
akin to the genuine brotner article to
atlsfy the masculine longing of any
maiden. The sleeves, save the cuffs, and
the back, are made of perfectly plain
material and have very little starch. The
front is stiffly starched, Is or the same

tiny design of some sort. The front

Hair dressing and neck dressing are
two important parts with the Parisian
woman. This winter she is wearing her
hair, both day and evening, in b?aut'fm
soft waves, and ornamenting it with .jew
eled pins.
With low-necked bodices she is -wearing
stocks of velvet caught with jeweled
slides, find broad "dog collars" composed
of several strings of pearl beads. Both
of theÃe are very becoming, and if there
Is a suspicion of bones it Is much prettier
that going with the neck perfectly bare.
This is a fancy that the Princess of Wales
has long adhered to.
White and bright shades of blue are fa
vorites for house wear. Hussar blue, the
shade worn by the military in Paris, is
the most popular. This >.olor looks es-
pecially well with furs both dark and
light.
Mitten sleeves are very new and chic.
They are made of the lace-like texture
that was used for old-fashioned mittens.
The arm shows through, and the sleeves
are cut so long they fall to the fingers.
No gloves are worn.
Jacket effects are very stylish. The lace
jacket must be long and the velvet jacket
shortâ more in bolero Btyle.
White velveteen is being used for tea
gowns. It is less expensive than velvet
and fully as effective.
The air tuck is the newest variety of
tucking. It is small in size and stands out
from the bottom edge of the tuck forming
its front, and gives the effect of being
lilted with air.
Silk crepe, a new kind of grenadine and
poplin are the most popular materials ia
black for spring wear.
The new tunic must be so long that it
does not show the bottom of the skirt.
and it must cross over the front of the
bodices showing a chemisette of pleated
white chiffon.

THE CARE
OF KID GLOVES
fp=^CONOMY in small things is often
r^ overlooked, and if only more con
r ? sideration were given to this sub-
ject quite a considerable sum of
money might be saved annually. The
careless manner In which a very large
number of ladies treat their gloves is an
instance in point, and perhaps the fol
lowing hints may serve to show how
the reasonable care of kid gloves would
result In a reduction of expenditure:
In the first place, it may be pointed

' disastrous to kid gloves, and It very

Cheap gloves are generally risky In
vestments, but pome of the best shops
keep a fairly good line of gloves at low
prices-, which are worth buying for com
mon wear. If strong and well made
they will serve for shopping and morn

ELLA WHEELER WILCOX'S OPINION
OF SELF-RESPECTING GIRLS
A CHARMING lady and well known
actress was recently brought Into
brief unpleasant notice through
being mentioned as a corespond
ent in a divorce suit.
The lady proved herself to be
innocent of the charges made against her
by valet and maid servant, and her
women friends have rallied to her de
fense as valiantly as men stand by one
another under similar circumstances.
This shows decided progress In woman
toward broader standards of friendship,
and should shut the mouths of K<-r de
tractors who love to harp upon the obso
lete theme of woman's enmity to woman.
Meantime, this maligned young woman
in the course of her testimony confessed
to having driven some distance, with a
married man on a matter of business, and
having accepted some Inexpensive pres
ents from the man, which facts had been
distorted and perverted by servants and
enemies.
Xevertheless, had tills young woman in
the beginning of her career drawn tbo line
sharply between single and married men
she might have escaped this disagreeable
experience.
There Is only one wise, discreet and safe
course for a young woman to pursue
When she enters upon a self-supporting
career. That course is to absolutely re
fuse the slightest attention from any mar
ried man, unless he acts as an emissary
from his wife. Even thÂ»n, if the young
woman is an actress, she should realize
that she is a target for the world's curi
ous glances and refuse to drive alone with
a married man, evt>n upon a matter of
business and even with the wife's appro
val.
The moment a girl relaxes her ideals in
regard to these matters she endangers
her reputation. It is useless for her to
talk about the cruelty of the world, which
will not allow a woman to enjoy a pla
tonlc friendship. The world, no doubt
is cruel and suspicious often, but platonic
friendships are rare game, and the young
woman who goes seeking them through
marital forests is frequently accused ot
poaching.
The man who Is happily married and is
a good husband does not go about seek
ing the society of professional young
women.
The married man who wants to dine
and drive with a single woman, no mat
ter what his excuse may be, is the one
she needs to be on her guard against.
He is always selfish In his motives.
Were he not he would not subject her to
the misconstruction which such actions
invariably give rise to. â¢

and dexterity, and when well done pays
admirably for the pains taken. Glove
powder should form one of the adjuncts

stretcher another*.
French women set a 'good example,
and have made quite an art of putting
on gloves, and this is why a Parisi
enne's gloves last her four times as long
as anybody else's.
Buttoning gloves should never be
done in a hurry. The wrist should be
carefully and gently pulled straight and
the buttons insinuated gently into the
holes. Use a glove butt oner always; it
ruins both the button holes and the
ringer tips to button them without.
After purchasing a new pair of gloves
always sew the buttons on before wear
ing them. The annoyance- of having the
buttons drop off will then be avolde^.â

Since the new year came in I have heard
of two events which have renewed my
faith in the goodness of humanity.
A man in a suburban town has pen
sioned his carriage horses ivhicn have
served him twenty years, and a him in
this city has pensioned an employe who
has grown old In working for the inter
ests of the business.
New voting horses are to draw the
family carriage in the future, but the
old pair will be given a Vavr.i stall in
winter and a green pasture in summer
while they live, in recognition of past
toil.
A younger man will serve the business
house, but the old man will receive a com
petence to the Â«>nd of his life.
This Is beautiful and just and right. It i
would be as beautiful were it not so un
common.
I do not know the name of this firm,
but I wish it might be spoken from every
pulpit in the land. It calls for a sermon
and a praise service.
There is no fate much sadder for a man
who has passed the half century mark
than to find himself, set out in the cold
to hunt for a new vocation or a new posi
tion.' He is like an old vine torn from
the trunk of a tree about which it has
clung all its life. He finds it almost im
possible to lift himself from the earth and
attempt to climb anew.
Yes. In these days of soulless corpora
tions and machine-like trusts, such events
are frequent. A man whose whole work
ing life has been connected with a busi
ness is considered no more than a fly on
the branch of a tree which the wood
man fells, if the corporation decides on
making changes. _ â¢
Many business houses whose heads pride
themselves on their fine sense of honor
in all business transactions never think
to bring this honor to bear upon their
treatment of employes who are no longer
serviceable to them. The men are dis
charged and given letters of recommenda
tion, and that is the end of it so far as
they are concerned; but for the dis
charged man it is often the beginning of
a tragedy. Every newspaper in the land
ought to give an editorial to the New
York firm which has established a new
and admirable precedent. .. . ..

The Bath as an Aid to Beauty

-^ the bath, when properly taken. Is
the greatest aid to beauty that

There is a story told of a famous beauty

I am sure, a tender spot In the heart for
the little newsboys, many of them mere
babies who should be rocked to sleep in
their mothers' arms instead of braving
cold and heat to help keep the family pot
boiling.
But it does seem a great pity that so
many of these boys seek to add to the
receipts of their legitimate business by
street begging. "When a tiny newsboy
s;rs. "Won't you please give a poor hoy
a penny, lady?" it in hard to refuse, yet
if we grant the request is it not encourag
ing the child to become a tramp and a
"dead beat"?
The moment a boy or man gets the idea
in his head of obtaining something- for
nothing he is lowering his moral nature
and dwarfing his spirit of independence.
It strikes me there is a large field here.
for Sunday-school teachers, teachers of
kindergartens and primary schools all
over the city. Every boy and girl should
have the truth drilled into their young
minds that all money transactions must
he "for value received,'' if they wish to
bo considered respectable and worthy citi
zens. A great deal more can be done in
this way for the rising generation than
by teaching the catechism or explaining
Bible parables. Let the little folks be
taught self-reliance and self-respect, and
lÂ«t them realize that business and begging
should never go hand in hand. The boy
who keeps his mind on selling his papers
will realize more profit than the one who

big, husky fellow, and he used to throw
my collectors out."
"Then why didn't you employ a

to a woman."

and sent her around, but she never
came back."

|of her loveliness. The clever old doctor ;
to whom she appealed gave her a vial ;
containing a colorless liquid, and in
structed her to take a daily bath of soft ,
! water in which were three drops of the
I precious liquid. His advice was followed
1 for years, and the lady preserved l>er ;
i beauty to a good old age. Meanwhile H >
| had been secretly discovered that the '
I elixir given her by her physician was
j nothing more or less than some of *ne '
same weu-r used for her baths. It waa â 
a ruseâ the only one which could have in- ,
duced her to take a daily bath, the mer
its of which the sage old fellow knew
full well.
The load to beauty was !".r.own to th a
Greek and Roman women hundreds of |
years ago. They did not begin to have t'ne '
resources in cosmetic arts that we have
now, but they understood thoroughly that
the two vital points in tne pursuit of
comeliness were cleanliness and health, j
To this end they bathed incessantly. Ath
letic games also occupied a large portion
of their time, and thereby liangs the se- J
cret of their well-developed forms and
fine, stately carriages. Oil of cocoanut
and almond oil formed tfhe basis of all
their lotions for the face.
These beauties of the past, no doubt. !
had much more leisure for their games
and baths than have the busy women of
the present day. but we might do worse
than follow In the wake of their most ex
cellent teachings. Their matchless love
liness proved the wisdom of their meth
ods.
The bathrooms in even the most ordi

veniently planned that ba.hlng. instead
of being a trouble, is a most invigorating
pleasure. I am a firm believer In the

thorough soapy scrubbing is necessary
each day, but I believe in the plunge and
quick sponge. Then once a week and in
many cases twice during the seven days
a thorough scrubbing should be indulged
in. In no other way can the flesh be kept
firm and healthy.
The cold bath, if one is robust enough
to stand it. is invigorating and a pre
ventive against taking cold, but for a
person of delicate physique would mean
almost certain suicide. Therefore. I do
not advise it as a general thing, for the
shock of the cold water immediately
closes the pores, and they retain impuri
ties that should be cast out. The best
way is to take a tepid sponge, letting the
cold water run until the bath Is pretty !
well chilled.
While the cold bath Is invigorating, the :
warm, soapy bath is necessary for actual
cleansing-. When taking this soapy bath
use plenty of pure castile soap artd a
flesh brush, a brisk scrubbing with which
will rid the cuticle of the tiny flakes that

the pores of their oily secretions as noth

The temperature of the water should
never be more than 90 or 95 degrees. 889
There is much diversity of opinion as
to whether a bath should be taken at
night or In the morning, which question,
I think, is best decided by the Individual.
It Is often claimed that a warm bath I
taken at night will soothe the nerves antJ
make one sleep like a baby, but I have j
known. many persons to whom It was an j
impossibility, making them restless and |

The bath taken before going to bed is
desirable for one reason: That is. that it
opens the pores of the skin and leaves It
in excellent condition to absorb a good
skin food, thus whitening and beautifying
the skin.
Take care not to take cold after a
warm bath. Envelop the body in a huge
Turkish towel and with it rub the body
briskly, dealing more gently with the
neck and face. If you can follow your
bath with a glass of warm milk and a
little trip to slumberland so much the
better. There. is nothing more restful.
A little salt thrown Into the bath is a
pleasant tonic when one Is worn out or
weary.' A little cornstarch in the water
will sometimes whiten the skin. Turkish
baths, indulged in occasionally, are splen
did complexion makers. When the skin
is dry and feverish a dry bath or massage
will assist the circulation and bring about
a more healthy condition of the skin.
If you wish a fragrant bath and one
which will give the skin a charming, vel
vety appearance, make yourselves some
bath bags. Formula for a very elaborate
one was given in the Sunday Call of Oc
tober 2. It Is a treasure and I hope a
lot of you .have tried' it. However, to
those of you who prefer something more
simple. I would suggest one that has been
used since the time of your grand
mothers. It is made by combining equal
parts of shaved castile soap, almond meal
and powdered orris root. Make your
bags out of cheese cloth and never' use
one a second time, as the meal is apt to
sour after using.

Answers to Correspondents.
S. M. H.â l think your physician w&s
right, in a way. The spots upon your
nose and the hard white lumps must be
a form of acne. These cases are obsti
nate always and when underneath the
skin, as in your case, particularly hard
to reach. I can only suggest the face
scrubbing brush and " thorough massage
with cold cream each night. Then see to
it that the blood Is kept In a state of ab
solute purity by strict attention to the
diet, exercise and baths. Avoid all rich,
greasy foods and sweets as well as acids.
Magnesia will not injure your skin.
G. E. M.â Sage tea la a splendid tonic
for the hair, and if made very strong will
also darken it slightly. Take a handful
of sage leaves and boil them into a tea.
Add two tablespoonfuls of alcohol to ' ach
quart, of the tea. and apply to the roots
of the hair with a small sponge just l
before going to bed at night, i Trim the
ends of the hair once a month, cleanse It
from dust collected during the day by
the use of the brush ea^h night and
shampoo every two v.-oeks. v
TOtJRRAINE C. â Scrubbing the face
each night with a camel's' hair complexion
brush, tepid water and Castile soap will
prevent the black specks from getting
into the pores and making you unhappy.
. Follow the scrubbing with application
of a good cold cream. Camphor ice Is ex>
cellent for chapped hands. The sage tea
just spoken ot in letter to a. K. will
be better than ordinary ten. for the eye
brows, as the latter will have no effect
upon their growth. Be careful though
about using it on the eyelashes, as almost
anything used upon them is liable to get
into the eyes and inflame them.
JESSIEâ There are a number of things
that can be used upon the hair to bring
out the reddish tints, but as you have
such a fine head of hair I have not the
conscience to advise any of them. Bleach
ing the hair is a kind of slavery, for as
the hair grows out of course it comes the
natural color and the bleach has to be ap
plied to the roots again and again. It is
almost sure to gpt too light in the end,
and when the roots are dark It gives the
head a most untidy appearance. So do
try ami be satisfied with your hair as it
is." I am sure it is prettier than it would
be if changed by artificial means. A tai
lor-made street gown is eminently proper
to wear to church, and whereas a Fedora
hat is not inappropriate, something a
trifle more dressy would be more suitable-.
Black and green are very pretty together,
and your idea for trimming your hat is
charming, except that I should omit the
aigrette, as they are but little worn now.
A READERâ For the red nose and face
try frequent applications of diluted witch
hazel, and sfe to it that the clothing is
loose, particularly about the waist and
neck. Also soak the hands and feet in hot
water every night. The liquid face pow
der that vnu are using is as good or better
than any T could give formula for. You
can use. it with perfect safety.
MRS. EMILY J. LEWISâ Apply witch
hazÂ»l to the dark circles under the eyes.
i If they are caused by some internal trou-
I ble, which ie more than likely, mediein*
I prescribed by a physician Is the only
thing that will do away with them per
manently.
M. P. 99â The orange flower skin food,
! which contains both lanolin and cocoa
nut oil, is used particularly to obliterate
; wrinkles. The other formula that I have
; given is a simplo cold cream. Use thÂ»
: skin food every night. The alum bath is
- to be used only in case of flabbiness of the
1 skin. I cannot possibly tell how long it
. will be before any effect will be noticed,
; as some skins respond more quickly to
treatment than others. I am really afraid
â  to suggest anything at all to darken the
; eyelashes. It is so dreadfully rlÃky to
'â¢â  apply any sort of a lotion. It Is sure to
get Into the eyes and injure or weaken
them lam sorry. The flesh at the back
of the neck can be reduced by rubbing
the flesh between the fingers. This will
dissolve the fatty tissues. Smear the
skin with cold cream before beginning
the massage. I prefer the camel's hair
complexion brush to all others. Am very
much pleased that you have found my
recipes so beneficial

CUTS OFF A CONTINENT.
Tremendous Effect a Canal Across the Isth
mus Will Have on Ocean
Trade.
AFTER pome seventy years of in
termittent contemplation of the
project the United States Gov
ernment seems now about to
take the work of constructing
the Nicaragua canal into its own hands.
The enabling legislation necessary
therefor has been well covered by the
very able bill drawn by Senator Mor
gan, which, with sÂ«->jne desirable amend
ments, was passed almost unanimously
by the Senate on the 21st inst. and is
now before the House.
A powerful lobby, including a depu
tation from the reorganized Panama
Canal Company, is at work attempting
to prevent or indefinitely delay favor
able action by that body, but from all
indications the measure will meet with
the same favor at its hands that it did
in th" Si Date. That the President will
promptly append his signature to the
bill is well understood. The project has
lon^ had his approval and he has been
in close touch with the friends of the
measure from the first.
The report of the commission appoint
ed Borne two years ago t<> estimate the
of the work puts it at a figure
Borne sixty millions less than the esti
mate for the completion of the Panama
canal abandoned since 1889.
The prowiise is* good that long inside
of the next decade passengers and
fr- i^'ht will be carried by sea from San
Francisco to New York in a minimum
of fourteen days, without change; that
a mighty bridge t water high up above
the kv>! pf the sea will carry the larg
est â  umers and men-of-war
dose under the shadow of the Central
American volcanoes across the narrow
strip of land that separates the oceans
and save marly 11,000 miles of sea
travel.
Though the total distance from sea
to sea on the route to be followed is
some 17'j miles, the total length of canal
ex< avation j* but twenty-eight miles.
Lake Nicaragua, the great reservoir of
feed for ' th ends of the canal, iies bow
with its surface 105 feet above the sea
level. A dam at Ochoa, on the San
Juan River, sixty-four and a half miles
the lake, will raise the level to
110 feet and mak" that much of the
Ban Juan River navigable for ocean
going vessels ot the deepest draught,
ake will be connected \ ith the Pa
cific by two sections of excavated canal
and the Tola basin, and with the At
lantic by slack water navigation on the
San Juan .id a series of basins in the
Valleys of San Francisco and Deseado
rivers connected by short sections of
canal.
The sea level on each side is to be
reached by tree locks located as nearly
as possible to the extremities of the
canal, which gi .-.-* a clear summit level
1W feet above the sea of 154 miles in
length. A most ' remarkable fact, only
possible by reason of the unique feat
ures above mentioned and which dem
onstrates the peculiar advantages of
this route above all others
Lake Nicaragua, the important and
controlling feature of the whole plan
has a surface area of 2GOO square miles'
and- the area of its water shed is 8000
The â¢ comparative sizes of these two
features render the lake and its outlet
the San Juan River, very stable In the
matter of surface level, the averae*
yearly rise, and fall being about five
feet.. The low water mark is 105
feet abo the sea level and the high
water line, which was chosen as the
summit level of the canal, 110 feet
above.
An even supply of water to maintain
this " vel is one of the most prominent
and certain features of this project.

One of the flourishing businesses of
Northern China is that of the brigand
insurance companies. These organiza
tions, for a specified fee, undertake to
protect the traveler from robbers. Be
fore starting on a journey arrange
ments are made with one of these con
cerns, and they send an escort of one
or two ao-called riflemen. Each com
pany has a distinguishing flag, which
is put in some conspicuous place either
mi the cart or boat, as the case may
be. Now, in meeting a band of brig
ands the convoy goes on ahead and
holds a parley, informing them that he
represents such and such an insurance
company, and if they recognize him as
a friend all well and good; if not, the
matter has to be fought out, which
usually results in the riflemen running
away.
It is very evident to any one that
these guarantee companies are merely
agents for the brigands, and as long as
this system is permitted to flourish so
long will Northern China be a robbers'
den.
The truth of the matter is that the
brigands in Manchuria are nothing
more than soldiers who were disbanded
after the late Japanese war and who
carried their rifles and ammunition
with them.
They are, however, a cowardly lot,
only making attacks between sunset
and sunrise.

The reports read dining the evening
showed thar the chapter during the year
bad a net gain of forty-three members,
and that the prospects for further in
crease are very good. One of the mem
bers said that one of the features of the
order was the one which exempts the
members from all chapter dues and ex
tra assessments. The ladies of the chap
ter have arranged for a grand entertain

the night of the Ist of February. There
will be a good musical and literary pro

bers of Richmond Camp held an open
meeting in their hall in the Richmond
District. There was a good attendance of
the friends of the members, and there
was presented a very entertaining pro
c:T:imrriÂ». which was followed by a social
and refreshments. The affair was well
â .Manned and well carried out. There were
present a number of members of other
camps.
Last Monday night Golden Gate ''amp
had two initiations, and after the induc
tion of the new members a committee of
five was named to assist the committee
on Woodmen's headquarters, and was
instructed to present a detailed plan at
the next meeting. The proposition is to
secure headquarters where the several
camps of the city can hold sessions, and
to have It so prominent that every one
may know where to find Woodmen when
wanted. The camp also, by a rising vote,
adopted resolutions to the memory of the
late Past Consul Commander Farrell.

BELLE JIROHER
IN
"J\ C ntented Woman."
EITHER Miss Belle Archer is con
siderably less of an actress than
she used to be or else my taste
in piay-acting is something bet-
tcr than it was in the old Fraw
1< y Company days. Then I thoueht
Miss Archer to be an actress of de
lightful address, a bit careless in her
work sometimes, but fairly easy and
accurate in the technique of her craft
and possessed of a certain worldly
thai was admirable in many
raits. Seeing her at the California the
other night in "A Contented Woman."
I suffered all sorts of disenchantment.
It was almost as bad a performance of
ihe part ot Grace -iolme as the one
pi yen by the late Caroline Miskell Hoyt.
and certainly it was Just as overposed
and amateurish. A good stage balance
is such a hard thing for a player to
acquire that, having once acquired it.
you wonder how it ive. can be foreot
ten. Miss Archer seemed to have start
ed work all over again, and in decided
ly the wrong way. Even in her voice
there is change; it is high-pitched.
cold and stringy and monotonously
cadenced. The lines that are supposed
\o be retaliatory' and satiric she reads
with the obvious emphasis that young:
girls, in their school day encounters
put upon such phrases as "Indeed!"
and "You don't say so?" Her gestures.
too, are misfit. They would be more
than adequate to the role of Lady Mac
beth. There is no illusion whatever
in the impersonation. In fact, it is not
an impersonation at all; it Is exagger
ated make-believe from one end to the
othi r, hardly more human in effect than
when children play at being adults.
The only amiable feature of Miss Arch
er's stellar venture that I can see is
her gowning. There is a personality
in dress as in all things, and Miss
An hers graceful costumes appear to
have been tailored eÂ»- cclally for her
oelf. They are to be admired without
Btlnt, but it dues seem a pity that Belle
Archer, as we i Ito know her. should
he left out of them.
. With one exception the rest of the
company is the usual vague crowd of
the Huyt revivalâ staccato women and
men whose deportment is hampered by
evening clothes. I've often wondered
how so many men of uniformly strange
manners contrive to find their way into
the â¢dress suits" of the Hoyt plays.
Perhaps they are the gentlemen whom
the reformed "legitimates" have crowd
i 1 out of the vaudeville business. Their
manners especially are most curi
ous. Mr. Hoyt'a "dross suits" are in
variably accompanied by cigars, which
in ordinary moments are usually worn
in the hand, until such time as the
smoker approaches a woman, where
upon he promptly transfers his weed
to his teeth, and saturates her coun
tenance in rich gray smoke. I noticed
this happen several times the other
nipht in "A Contented Woman." In
one instance a young: lady came peril
ously near Â»<> smashing: the carefully
nurs'd ash of a perfecto on her chin.
â¢ say that if she had spoiled that
smoke the performance â  would have
been parted in the middle. Another
Hoyt '-haracteriPtic was the plenitude
of profanity.. There were times when
"damns" and "helle" were as thick as
telegraph poles out of a railway car
riage window. I wondered if Mr. Hoyt
supplied them all, or did the actors
sulphur their lines at will. There ought
to bo a limit. Profanity is too popular
a form of comic emphasis to lose its
potency through over usage. The ex
ception mentioned in the beginning of
this paragraph is Mrs. Fanny Denham
Rouse, who gives a vigorous identity to
the part of Aunt Jim, the best char
acter work of the new-woman mother
in-law variety that I have seen.
â¢ â¢ â¢
In the Aldazar's performance of
"Men and Women," I noticed some bad
g that was strikingly similar to
Miss Archer's, It was contributed prin
cipally by the new leading woman, Miss
Adelaide Fitzallen, in the part of Agnes
Hodman. This part, one of the most
Laura Jean Libbyish ever achieved by
David Belasco, will stand for a great
deal of strenuous treatment without
seeming any more comical than it
really is. But Miss Fitzallen, in her
enthusiasm, quite exceeded the possi
bilities of any role in the literature of
the theater. Her effort was simply
prodigious. She loosed upon the char
acter what was easily the emotions of
three strong women and ten men. And
her gesturesâ well, put Miss Fitzallen
and her gestures in "A Contented
"Woman" and I'd like to see the middle
weight cigar specialist who would blow
smoke into her beautiful features. As
I was saying, it was Miss Archer's case
over again â large, obvious, make-be
lieve play acting. I am coming to
think that good acting, like a good cock
tall, depends more on what you leave
out than what you put in.
Howard Scott, who played the lawyer
â with stupendous elaboration, would do
well to bear this in mind. Nearly
everybody in the company worked too
hard for this world, except perhaps the
ptage manager, whose restraining hand
was nowhere felt. The Alcazar people
<i;iys make quite a snug little
company, and 1 believe that they can
;i much more definite performance
than this of the past week. Mr. Os
bourne, of course, did his usual strong,
deliberate work in the Jewish banker,
and Ernest Hastings handled the un
fortunate cashier with likely dignity
preoccupation. In the "handcuff"
scene Mr. Hastings' performance was
in remarkably good poise.

"The Idol's Eye," which of the two Her

Harry Webster. C. Jay Williams. Rose
Stu-irt. Blanche Chapman. Gertrude
Roosevelt, Rose Bnyder, Dorothy Usner
and Jessie Conant.
At the end of the first act occurs the in
cident which explains why Mr. Smith left
home. His conduct is placed in an ex
tremely equivocal light and hi.s wife*
aunt, who has had two matrimonial fail
ures of her own. easily induces her niece
to do the important thins in such a cir
cumstance. Out of this grows the plot,
which is said to lie happily between the
frivolity of farce and the credibility of
comedy.
The /\lcazar.
Sol Smith Russell's old success, "Peace
ful Valley," will be given at the Alcazar
thifl week. The piece is by Edward Kid
der, author of "A Poor Relation," and
successfully played by Mr. Russell for
several seasons. San Franciscans last
Â«aw the piece in IS9O. when Mr. Russell
produced it at the Baldwin. The plot is
laid in the White Mountains in New
Hampshire. The first act opens up on the
Age Top House, a summer resort, on the
summit, and finds Hottes Howe, a coun
try lad living on one of the heavily mort
gaged highland farms with his mother.
Hosea is working in a menial capacity at
the summer hotel, at which are stopping
several wealthy New Yorkers, among
them a young heiress by the name ot
Virgie Rand. Hosea happens to see Miss
Vlrgie in company with a man whom he
recognizes as the betrayer of his sister
Hosea separates the couple, gives the
guilty one a thrashing and explains his
Iction to Virgie. After that she finds
favor -with Hosea. who soon after lea\es
for New York, to find his sister, liquidate
the mortgage and finish his schooling. The
sequel finds Virgie and Hosea engaged
and everybody happy.

The Orphcum has four new acts for this

to the theatergoers of this city are Mil

made a great hit in vaudeville. Giaclnta
Delia Kocco, th<> vtolinlste, is another

Last Thursday night the New Tork
Casino presented "La Belle Helena.," an
up to date edition of the noted French
opera bouffe. "Rialtoized." as one critic
calls it. Libretto improved by Louis Har
rison and music added to Offenbach by
Englander. It was a success.
The public often wonders what is the
attitude of opera singers toward news
paper criticisms. The De Reszkes, Nor
dica and Sembrich read their press notices
very carefully; Melba is indifferent as to
what is written about her, and Eames'
husband uses the scissors liberally before
he permits his wife to read the critics.
Listen to J. E. Dodson on the eternal
cubject of acting as an art: "Of course,
I consider acting an art, but I know there
are many who do not. To be sure, it ta
much abused, and, like many other arts,
often deteriorates into a trade. An actor
is born, not made. I do not believe in tbe
made-to-order actor, and while I admit
that by training one may reach a state
of respectable mediocrity, unless he pos
sess that indefinable something, call it
what you will, ho never becomes an artist,
but always remains a piece of mechanism,

amount of training received. Do not un
derstand me as trying to belittle dramatic
studies, for my intention is anything but
that. What I wish to convey is that, in
my opinion, no amount of study will make
an actor out of a man unless it is born in
him. Studyâ and constant studyâ ls to be
desired at all times, and no matter how
talented an actor is, if he does not ap
ply himself with the greatest ardor to
his profession he is not much better off
than his less gifted brother.
"Speaking of mechanical actors." con
tinued Mr. Dodson, "naturally leads up
to the much-disputed point as to whether
an actor should or should not f<-el the
emotion which he is depicting. It is a
subject which would be discussed with
interest ad infinitum. and. of course, there
would be people who would always take
opposite sides, as now. In my humble
opinion, an actor should to a certain ex
tent feel the depicted emotion, but at the
same time he must control it by his art.
and never let it take such hold of him
as to make him forget it. He must pos
sess a dual consciousness, as it were. As
I once heard it expressed, the balance
counterpoise. There is nothing less pa
thetic to me than a crying woman unless
I know and am interested in her. With
red nose and eyes, she is anything but
pitiful to me. Now, on the stage an act
ress portraying a weeping mother or wife
Is expected to make it so effective as to
hold the sympathy of an audience, and
this she cannot do if she allows her emo
tions to get control of ier intelligence so
as to make them dormant, when she
should be guiding them by her art."
Mr. Belasco's "Zaza" and Mr. Belasco's
"Mrs. Carter" are the talk of the hour
In New York. This is part of what Ed
vjard A. Dithmar writes on the subject
in the Times:
The portrayal by Mrs. Leslie Carter of
Zaza In the shocking play taken from the
French of MM. Simon and lierton by
David Belasco is noteworthy for unfail
ing verity, extraordinary vitality, variety
of expression and moving force. It is
audacious beyond comparison with any
but very few theatrical exhibitions insep
arably allied with dramatic art ever seen
here. The variety halls and some of
the less reputable theaters have some
times put performances on view quite as
coarse and audacious, but they have
never commanded the attention, as this
exhibition does, of decent persons who
view the drama as an art, because they
have had no esthetic value. The es
thetic value of Mrs. Carter's portrayal of
Zaza, the female outlaw, Is indisputable.
Moreover, the play ia an uncommonly

! skillful example of dramatic realism â
. From beginning to end, in every episode,
does Mrs. Carter's acting have the effect
I of direct, undeviating, often deplorable,
truth to nature. Only in act I can it be
called positively indecent. There vice,
unrelieved, is rampurt. The central fig
ure is a low woman employing her
arts. But as the play proceeds It is all
found to be as common and vulgar as the
life it treats of. It la. also, from first to
j last, human and understandable, and the
realistic art employed in it is potent and
powerful if not refined and beautiful â
That, however, will never excuse "Zaza"
in the minds of persons who think the
theater should be the abiding place of
childlike innocence and purity. Such folks
ought to be warned away from "Zaza."
Charles Frohman, in accordance with
his declared Intention, makes a new pro
duction each year at the Boston Museum,
of which house hc> is one of the lessees
and managers. For iuh production this
season he selected the latest work
from the pen of William Gillette, adapted
by that gentleman from the French of
Bisson and Leclerq. and entitled "Because
She Loved Him So âa title that, for those
who are familiar with Mr. Gillette's jug
glery with captions, is pregnant with nu
merous farcical possibilities. The piece j
has just been produced in New York.
This is the story:
Though the most jealous and unreason
able of her sex. with a firm conviction
that all men are monsters of infeiuity,
Gertrude West is really, if she would be
lieve it, one of the happiest of women.
Married to a husband who adores her, she |
would have, but for her suspicious nature, j
no bitter drops in her matrimonial cup. It I
Is true that there is some seeming cause ',
for alarm. By a Mephistophelian ruse, |
Susan, her maid, who baa her reasons for i
wishing to provoke a domestic broil, spills '
upon her master's coat some most com- f
promising perfume, ana places on his i
sleeve two of her own long, golden hairs, t
Quite enough evidence is this to arouse I
Gertrude to fury, and she begin? to think :
of nothing short of divorce. Warned be- |
forehand of the impending avalanche, Mr. j
and Mrs. Wotherby. her father and moth
er, make arrangements to meet it.
In order to disgust the young couple ;
with the notion of quarreling, they adopt
the system of the Spartans, who, as a |
cure for inebriety, exhibited to their j
children a drunken Helot. As a result,
they were found by their daughter and
son-in-law in a blaze of conjugal strife,
though in a married life of thirty odd
years they have never had a cross word.
Far a time, accordingly, until this confla
gration can be extinguished, the hero and
heroine have to sink their own grievances
and declare a truce. So rooted In her j
belief In masculine baseness <s Gertrude i
that she strives at once to prove her !
father at fault. By an accident she brings j
to light a past escapade of Mr. Weather
by, and converts Into a real quarrel the
mock feud.
As at the same time hor inquisitorial
proceedings succeed in setting by the ears
Mr. and Mrs. Jackson, previously one of
i the happiest of married couples, and
ruining the matrimonial chances of her

At first thought it may seem para
doxical to say that a man is the most
original of writers and at the same time
the greatest of plagiarists. Yet ac
cording to Literature (December 3) thia
statement would not be altogether ab
surd if applied to Shakespeare, for in
stance. The moral of this is that
"original" and "originality" are words
possessed of a certain amount of am
biguity. The writer says:
"We all know J that Shakespeare's
borrowing arm was a very long one in
deed. Old chronicles, North's 'Plutarch,*
medieval English poetry, Italian novel
ists, contemporary playwrights â
were laid under contribution; and in
the same way Milton probably .. con- :
veyed 'L' Allegro*, and 'II Penseroso'
from Burton's 'Abstract of Melancholy,'
ami certainly made considerable- use.
of the Dutch poet's 'Lucifer' in
the construction of 'Paradise Lost.'
'Tristram ' Shandy' is one of the
most 'original' books in English litera
ture, and yet it is a patchwork of out
rageous thefts, and Melancholy Burton
himself, from wTiom Sterne stole, con
trived to get the effect of 'originality'
into his 'Anatomy,' which is a mere
cento of quotations.
. "In -one sense of the word there is no
such thing as originality, in another,
sense it is not uncommon. The Italian
novelists from, whom Shakespeare pla
giarized were themselves but copyists
from older sources, and folklorists axe
aware that the Europeans of the mid
dle ages enjoyed tales that had amused'
Asia in far antiquity. The matter of
a literary work of art may come from
nature, from life, or from another book,
while the form is created by the author.
"In some of Poe's tales it is easy
enough to detect the influence of Mrs.
Radcliffe, and Mrs. Radcliffe drew her
stories from a very imperfect and dis
torted notion of medieval romance, and
medieval romance was founded to a
considerable extent on early Celtic
legends, and Celtic legends must owe
a good deal to prehistoric Turanian in
fluence â and so the ladder mounts till
it vanishes as in the Indian juggler's
trick; but for all that the 'Fall of the
House of Usher' is original. It is barely
possible, of course, that the Paleolithic
Age swarmed not only with monsters
(now happily extinct), but with purely
original geniuses, but in modern times
It would be as useless to search for the
one as for the other."
Parliamentary candidates will find
something to interest them in the most
recent puti.ication of the Historical Manu
scripts Commission. Among tne Ailes
hury papers we read that at Jfarlborough
in 1712 the Duke of Somerset â¢ffereu an
elector for his vote, on behalf of a nomi
nee, a pension of $li<o per annum for lifp,
and to make him porter of Sion Housp.
To another he offered a pension of $200,
with a post worth another $200 a year:
and to others he grave sums of money
varying from $1000 to $1250. Again, he
promised to educate the son of a hurgfss
and present him to a good living as soon
as he was old enough. Strane-e to say,
the Duke's candidate was unsuccessful.
He was a Whig, and it is suggested that
the Tories must have been more liberal.
To prevent domestics breaking any
thingâkeep a cat in the house, and
you will never hear of anything being
broken by the servants. _^__^

CANNED FRUIT AND SALMON IN EN
GLAND.
The London Grocers' Gazette of January 14
Fays: There is as yet no news of the vessels
bringing last year's pack of California fruit,
and until the arrival of these, business in this
department la at a standstill. The llrst ship
is now rather overdue, and there is every
prospect of a good ide In f.'aJlf'miian aprl
cots, pears and peaches. Prices are linn,
though somewhat higher than la: t year. The
supply of lin<> fruits and really good stand
ards will be scarce. Demand Cor salmon is sat-
Isfactory for the season, though still light. A
good business la, however, anticipated during
the coming month or two. Prices are very
firm, and advancing for 'i-lb tins. The sup
ply of l-lli flats is ely to be short for the
Reason, but quotation* being very much high
er will lessen the demand. The arrival of last
season's pack is anxiously looked for, and lm
mediately this begins to come to hand a con
siderable Increase In business will result.

NEW YORK MONEY MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 2S.â The Financier says:
Estimates as to the amount of cash gained j
by the New York Clearing-house banks for the
week ending January 27 were very much at
variance with the actual results disclosed by
Saturday's statement.
Treasury figures proved that the operations
: for the past six days were against the banks
> by nearly or quite $600,000. The interior move
: ment had been counted upon to swell cash totals
about $3,000,000. Instead of that, however, the
reported gain was no less than $7,679,200, of
which $4,411,800 was in tlie form of specie.
Obviously this expansion does not represent
exclusive interior receipts. This conclusion is
borne out by the fact that one large bank
alone reports an Increase of nearly S.'.'l'Kt.Ofl') in
gold, or almost 6Â» per cent of the total cash
gains for the week. In other words, the In
â  10 in loam by all the banks
hi i ight down the reserves of some Individual
institutions even in the face of very heavy
gains In the average surplus holdings. The
deposits, owing to the loan and cash expansion,
Bhow an Increase "f $12,563,400, bringing the
t"tal t.> $861,637,500, a figure altogether unpre
cedented. Despite thÂ« Increased reserve re
quirements the surplus is $4,500,000 higher than
a week I.L". and is now $39,232,025. Such a
statement forecasts but one condition â a con
: tlnuc-.l easy money market, accompanied prob
ably by further manifestations of tli" expansion
which has been a prominent factor for some
weeks past. Still, the policy of the banks Is
' one of conservatism ar,Â«J they are not making
extraordinary efforts to employ their surplus
in any but secure channels. The spirit of dls
, crimination aeainst over-Inflated collateral Is
based on soundest Judgment, and while the
; institutions have not protited on the present
uprise in value.-, ;hey are in a position where
! they can direct to a large extent the course of
! future speculation in safer directions. In the
opinion of some conservative officers the pres
ent condition yf the money market is rendering
imperative some changes in existing bank
â  practices as applied to the flow and ebb of
money from this center.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
1 CHICAGO, Jan. Wheat opened without
excitement. %@%C higher at 7'< I Â«'u7S%c, but
after a little backing and filling at starting
figures it began to yield a little to selling by
local speculators. The latter were influenced
to take the course they did owing to the ab
sence of any heavy buying orders from the out
side and in the indifference that Liverpool trad
ers appeared to have for the strength prevail
ing on this side, quotations from there show-
Ing a decline of ',i@Ud. About this time Corn
! began to show such decided strength that May
recovered from 77% cto 78% c. The bulls derived
1 some comfort for a time irom a London cable
: gram which told of severe Irost prevailing
throughout Southern Russia without any snow
to protect the fall wheat. During the latter
j part of the session longs liquidated freely, and
i as the demand dropped off the selling increased
I In volume, becoming very large near the close.
| May sold down to 76% c, a break of l%c from
! the top price of the day. The bears did not dis
pute the rally that set In on buying to even up
over Sunday. In the last five minutes May
rose to 77% c buyers, where it closed. â¢
Corn opened firm and then yielded quickly
on account of local selling. Wall street was
buying heavily and the price recovered in a
lively fashion to a point within a small fraction
of the highest figure it had previously sold at
this season, but was once more trampled down
by local selling. May closed with a loss of 1
%Â©%c.
Oats were treated to heavy selling while the !
market shared In the general nervousness
j which attended 'trade in the other grains, and i
! prices eventually settled upon a downward
course. May closed %@%c lower.
Provisions were firm with the volume of
speculation large. Packers did considerable
selling at the start, but the offerings were soon
i put out of the way by commission house buy
! ing, and an advance set in all around. Toward
the end, when the grain markets developed
decided weakness, the Improvement was all
lost. The range in lard and ribs was small.
The close was practically unchanged from yes
terday.

PRINCE
I DON`T CARE
RINCE I DON'T CARE ran rapidly
toward the castle, that he might enter
before the news of the death of Gor
bozo reached the ears of the daughter
forbozd. Hearing footsteps behind
him. the Prince looked around and was
surprised to see the giant's dog, Blood
fillikin, following. He crouched be-
Bide the road, hoping to escape the
notice of the dog, and, to his sur
prise, the â¢'.â >Â£ ran rapidly by with
out iooking around. When he saw
that the dog bumped into a tree he
at once knew that Bloodfillikin had
. ;, made blind, and he shrewdly
guessed that the giantess had put the dog's eyes out so
that the animal might not tear him to pieces "I am
lucky, as usual," said the Pri.ice. "I can deal :th giants
better than I can with dogs." He then made bold to call
log, which "at once turned about and rushed madly
In his direction.
"Slowly and gently." said the- Prince, as he stepped
aside and lot the great animal go by; "you must know
that I am the master now. Gorbozo is dead and I am
going to the castle to be the king as long as it suits
me. But there is no reason why we should not be friend?.
To tell the truth, I am sorry that you are blind. I would
Hk-i to take you hunting with me. If I Will get you back
SfOttr sight what will you do?"
It may seem strange- that the Prince should talk to the
I xhaps stranger it was that tho dog should
understand and be able to answer: but he understood, and
Ised thai if he could have his sight back he would
he the friend of the Prince, and woifld follow him and
him at all times. "Very well," said the Prince:
with me." He led the way to a cave, where a very
Wise man lived, and soon the wise man had cured the
that he could see as well as ever, using magic to
Âuck the lost siÂ«!:t.
The Prince and Bloodflllikin passr-d through the castle
gate together and entered the castle. Grundalkin, the
plant's daughter, heard them coining, and met them on
the great stairway. "Where is my father?" she asked
â  of the Prince. "I killed him," answered the Prince
boldly, "because he was an enemy to all honest men.
â¢Now I am come to be the new master of the house. I want
<=(,n!P dinner for myself and my dog, and be quick about it."
â  The giantess already knew that her father was dead.
A bird had brought the news while the Prince was at the
-inn's with r>ioodfiliikin. She was surprised that the
Prjnce should be bold enough ;<â  t<i! about what he had
done, and was very angry to have him give orders to her.
"My little Prince." she screamed, "I will have to give you
a \rs3lm which you very much Deed." So saying, she tried
to seize the Prince, but he was much too quick for her.
Around and around she chased him. until she fell over
ihe dog, which had run in front of her just as she was
.â bout to seize the brave Prince. Grundalkin's fall shook
the castle to its foundation. From its place on the wall

TED`S STORY
BY B.E.VELÂ» STOUT- PLACERVILIX .
S\Y. there's a baby at our house,
Only came last night â
Mouth the size of a buttonhole,
Tiny little mite.
Rut I wish it was a boy,
Oh, yes. you bet I do;
There's but one boy in our family.
And I wish that there were two.
Next time the doctor comes
And brings a baby here.
He'll have to bring a baby boy
< >r else I'll interfere.
For I'm awful tired of sistersâ
They are always dressed up so,
At least my sisters always are,
And cross as any crow.
I've pnx a grown-up sister,
And 1 forgot to say
That she mended' up my trousers
And I've got them on to-day.
I'll tell you how it came about:
When 1 went out to swim
I ton my trousers nearly off â
I caught 'em on a limb.
If I hadn't been a thinkin'
Of Bill and Larry Oout
I wouldn'thave donned these trousers,
I'd have known what I was about.
themselves that they were superb and
had never looked so lovely before.
"We must all look our best," said th*
Marechal Neil rose, with an admiring
glance at herself, "for Princess will
come soon." and she was right.
Soon the Princess Rosebud appeared,
looking lovely in her simple white dress
adorned with pink ribbons. The chief
â ncr followed. She had not gone
far when the three elegant roses met
her eyes. An exclamation of delight
broke from her and her blue eyes grew>
down fell the hunting spear of her father, Gorbozo, having
been jarred from its place by Grundalkin's fall. Its keen
point pierced the right hand of the unfortunate giantess,
and she could not rise until the Prince would pull out the
spear. "What will you do if I will give you freedom?"
asked the Prince.
"Be a good Prince and do not take vengeance upon me
and I will serve you forever."
So the Prince now had two servants. Grundalkin and
Bloodfillikin. He remained at the castle only three days
before he was ready to go out in search of more giants,
for he had promised the King of the country that he would
rid the land of all the giants, and BloodfiHikin, who had
become very fond of his new master, had told him all
about where three giants (brothers) lived in a castle in
the Gloomy Forest, and waylaid and robbed travelers,
often going out into the surrounding country and carry
ing off men, women and children, whom the giants held
as slaves, and compelled them to work in a coal mine,
deep under the ground. These three giants were named
Corafix, Lejundire and Kavallaâ the last named being
otherwise known as "the battle ax," from the huge battle
ax which he had always by hie side, waking or sleeping.â
for he was afraid of his two brothers, and he had many
enemies among the giants, who were then quite common
in the land. "I will visit these giants at once," said the
courageous Prince. Bloodfillikin was ready to go. and
they went away in company, the Prince not forgetting to
command Grundalkin that she should not open the gate of
Gorbozo's castle to any one except the Prince.
Now Grundalkin waÂ« fond of the Prince. Her father
had been so cruel to her that she had long been afraid that
he would kill her. She knew that he had planned to sell
her as a slave to Kavalla. She knew also that Kavalla
was aa wise as he was mighty. Hardly had the Prince
left the castle of Gorbozo before Grundalkin had locked
the gates securely and was follnwing the Prince and
Bloodflllikin as they went to hunt the three giant brothers.
The Prince came to an enchanted bridge, across which,
according to the law of the country, no man could pas?.
He wished to go over, for night was coming on, and he
did not like to pass the night in the Gloomy Forest, be
cause of the great numbers of wild beasts that roamed by
night, fierce and dangerous.
"It Is written, good master," said Bloodflllikin, "that
the man who walks or rides a horse over this bridge will
surely be eaten by the wild beasts-"

"How lovely!" she exclaimed.

"Wait until I see them all," she an

She looked at all the flowers, and at

Its head bent shyly as her gaze rested

'Oh." she cried, stooping to inhale

So the Violets were plucked and made

them in her fair hands, and they were

IN DANCER.
BY ANNIE E. HALL
MRS. MOSS was sitting at her
sewing when she heard foot
steps. Her husband was away
at work in the next town, and
there were no neighbors living
near. Her three children were playing
upon the floor. By her side was Harry,
her eldest child. He looked out and
exclaimed:
"Mamma, there is an Indian in our
yard."
Mrs. Moss quickly put the small chil
dren in a closet and locked the door, as
she had done 'many times before, when
Indians were near. Harry, who was
used to Indians, could keep the chil
dren quiet, although he was but 6 years
old. Willie was 5 and Carrie was 4.
The Indian who had been first seen
came to the door, followed by three
Now I'm going to see the baby
And ask what I can do.
[Time â Two weeks later.]
Oh, yes, you needn't be laughin'
'Bout what I said two weeks ago.
I didn't know the baby then â
Andâ now â 1 do, you know!
The girls their minds can be changing.
To change triem I've heard is their
joy.
A chance at a second thought, surely
You would not deny to a boy.
My trousers now are clean worn out,
They won't be patched any more;
They met their ruin yesterday,
When I slammed ma s bedroom door.
Then I hung the remains of my trous
ers
High up in the cherry tree,
And I gave a cheer for the patches,
The national colors three.
Now I've got a new pair of trousers.
But the patched ones were the best,
For the patches were quite firm,
While the shingle wore out the rest.
The shingle! Ma kept it well poUshed!
And oft 'twould have made a bad
bother
If under the trousers aforesaid
I hadn't carried its brother.
others, and asked for some whisky.
Mrs. Moss told the Indians that she
could not. get the liquor for them, as
h< r husband had the key of the closet
in which it was kept. She also said
her husband would not be home for an
hour.
So thp Indians sat down and waited.
Mrs. Moss got her children into the
next room by a back door without the
knowledge of the Indians. She did
not wish to leave the house, for she
knew that the Indians would look for
To this the Prince said: "If I should wait to hear what
any one has said or written I would never enter the castle.
I am not afraid to ride, but see, I will get over without
breaking the law." So saying, he jumped upon the back
of Bloodflllikin and was carried over by the dog. The gate
to the castle of the three brothers was suddenly thrown
open. At the same instant a sound like thunder smote
the air. Looking in the direction from which the noise
came the Prince saw a huge coach, as large as a house,
drawn by sixteen monstrous horses, and having on the
front seat the largest giant in all the land. It was rapidly
drawing near the gate of the castle, which had. in fact,
been thrown open for it to enter. There were three giants
in the coach, who were, in fact, the three brothers.
Kavalla saw the Prince and knew him.
"Ha, ha, ha," 'bawled the fierce giant; "see the Prince
of giant hunters."
The three giants leaned to one side of the coach to see
the Prince, of whom they had all heard, and their weight
turned the coach over with a great clatter. The Prince
did not waft for them to get out from under the coach,
but ran inside of the castle, marveling much that his
luck was still so good. Here he was in the castle with the
three giants, who soon arrived, and all he had to do was
to make his plans and carry them out. Would you have
trembled had you been placed in such a situation? "But."
said the Prince, "there are only three of them, and I don't
care."
The Prince hid in a box, in which Kavalla kept his
helmet of solid steel. Through a hole in the side of the
box he received fresh air and was able to see out. "Broth
ers," said Kavalla, "I know that Prince I Don't Care is
very near, for I smell him." To this the helmet, which
was enchanted, replied: "He is indeed near. He is in
me, the helmet." Kavalla picked up the helmet box and
then discovered the Prince. The little hero looked so
small that, when the giant held him in his hand, all the
giants laughed loudly at the idea that so small a human
being could be dangerous to three giants. "Let's amuse
ourselves with him, and see If he is as clever as we have
heard," commanded Kavalla. Call in Grimalkin, and let
the two do battle." No sooner said than done. Grimalkin
was a cat as large as an ordinary lion, and just as fierce.

1 v. If they found that she had gone
away they might kill her three chil
dren. So she locked up the children In
a stronger closet and gave them a plate
of cookies to keep them from crying.
Hardly had she done this when the
Indians seized and bound her and led
Yipv away to where some ponies stood
fastened. They tied her to a pony and
mounted the other ponies, being care
ful to set the house on fire. After
they had ridden some miles they were
joined by a band of Indians. They
then took Mrs. Moss and bound her to
a tree. After piling brush around the
tree the Indians lay down and went to
Bleep t<> wait for morning. Mrs. Moss
struggled with the rope and finally
managed to get free. As she was a
good rider, she mounted an Indian
pony and rode away, starting very
slowly that she might not awaken the
Indians.
Her distress of mind was great. All
the way homeward she thought of the
three children whom she had been com
pelled to leave in the burning house.
She thought, too, of Tier husband and
of the horror he must have experienced
when he saw his ruined home. As it
grew lighter she saw that she was
drawing near where her home had been.
All at once the house ca- c into sight.
She went in and greeted her husband
and children.
Mr. Moss told her that he had come
home and had noticed a corner of the
house smoking. After he had nut out
the fire he went in and discovered that
his wife and children were gone. Pretty
soon he heard Harry calling him. and,
the children told him, after- they had
been let out of the closet, that the
Indians had been around. He knew
then th.it the Indians had carried
Moss away.
He sent for neighbors â¢to hunt for
her. He did not dare to leave the chil
dren alone. So he had waited, and now
he was delighted to see her. The Dartv
to hunt the Indians was made up and
drove the savages off. But Mr. Moss
would not live longer where there was
so much danger to his family, and soon
moved into town.
Bobbyâ What is candy?
Pa â Glucose, flavor and toothache.
The Prince could only draw his sword when the cat made
ready and sprang at him. "Play dead," Bloodflllikin had
whispered to him. The Prince obeyed, stiffening out and
closing his eyes partly. Grimalkin was puzzled and stood
still. Kavalla roared: "What a pretty mess is this? The
lit lie Prince is a coward, after all. See, he has fainted."
With that Kavalla soused the Prince in a great drinking
bowl, where he was nearly drowned. When the Prince,
gave signs of life Kavalla once more looked at him scorn-,
fully. "A pretty Prince is this," he said, "who boasts of.
killing giants, and who faints at the mere sight of a cat."-
With that all the giants lost interest in the Prince
and did not fear him longer. He was allowed to walk'
about the floor while the giants ate and drank. They did
not think that he could get away, as the doors of the castle
had been all barred by them. They shouted and sang and
laughed until late at night. Then Kavalla thought to in
quire where the Prince was. They searched everywhere,
but the Prince, secretly advised by Bloodflllikin, had found
a hiding place in which he could not be found. At last
the giants went to bed. At midnight, just as the castle
clocks were striking the hour, there was a great clatter
at the castle gate. "Let me in," pleaded a voice. "I bring
you news of Gorbozo, your friend and my father." It was
Grundalkin, Who, fearing that harm had befallen the
Prince, had taken this way to find out. The Prince, whose
temper was none of the best, and who was without (ear,
slipped from his hiding place and his voice was he^arc
above the noise made by the giants as they threw open
the castle windows to find out what Grundalkin meantâ
"Go home, Grundalkin. and mind the castle, as I bade
you. lam here, and I will destroy all the giants. Go
home, lest they should take possession of my castle, which
was Gorbozo's until I slew him." At this news the three
giants were furious. The Prince had really destroyed Gor
bozo, then, and he was boasting, in their castle and in
their hearing, that he would destroy them. Kavalla'
caught the Prince before he could get back to the hiding,
place from which he had boldly rushed./ "Oh, yes," he said,.
"I have disposed of Gorbozo, and I have come to kill you
all." At this Kavalla opened a window and threw the'
Prince out. Had he fallen to the ground the Prince would]
surely have been killed. Luckily, he caught hold of a- vine,
that grew by the window, and held fast. His presence of<
mind did not forsake him even then. Pulling his scabbard
loose, he threw that to the ground with much force. It<
struck so heaviliy that Kavalla thought that the Prince"
had met his death from the fall. Being lazy, the giants
went to sleep again, and once more the castle was still.]
But Grundalkin. waiting near, knew what had happened.]
When the Prince saw her he was glad, after all, that she. ;
had not obeyed him. At his command she raised a huge,
ladder and placed it against the side of the castle, oppo-'
site Kavalla's bedroom. Running nimbly up the ladder."
Prince I Don't Care stepped into Kavalla's room so quietly]
that the giant did not awaken. The Prince had been told]
that Kavalla's courage would leave him if his battle ax.
were taken away. There it stood beside the giant's bed-<
side, heavy and keen as a knife. The Prince was unable"
to lift it without help. He found a rope and threw one]
end of the rope out of the window, having fastened the,
other. end to the ax. Then Grundalkin pulled on the rope..
The ax was hoisted to the level of the window shelf and
fell upon the ground below with a terrific noise. Kavalla;
heard the crash, leaped from his bed, found that his ax.
was gone and realized that with it his courage was gone.,
At the door of the bedroom, with drawn sword, stood.
Prince I Don't Care. "Stand still," ordered the Prince ;<
"one step in my direction at your peril." The giant was
inclined to laugh, but the Prince stood firmly at his post'
and did not budge an inch. D. H. W. "

A VIStT TO BUG HOLLOW.
BY ALMA S. BEMENDERFER.
PROFESSOR GROSVOLT was con
sidered one of the most talented
of entomologists. Complaints ar
rived from all over the country.
More came from a certain farm
ing section in regard to a strange in
sect. Letters were received from all
classes, and the letters on file in his
office were a curious collection.
Professor Grosvolt at last decided Â±o
visit that part of the country and make
a personal investigation; so, armed
with a large valise, filled with an odd
assortment of appliances for the study
of bugs, he took the train to the affect
ed district.
Indeed, tnere wan nothing in the Pro
fessor's appearance to cause excite
ment. He was unobtrusive and of a
quite gentle demeanor. When he got
off at the place which he mentally
dubbed "Bug Hollow," it was with a
grave manner. As he did not like to
consult with his colleagues till he could
make a business-like statement, he had
only given orders for a boy to meet
him at the station and conduct him to
the locality where the curious parasites
were making alarming inroads on crops,
crops.
A barefooted boy in knickerbockt >-s
met him on the platform as the train
was steaming out, and, taking the va
lise, guided him along a dusty road
toward an adjacent field.
"Ah!" remarked the professor, as he
walked through an open gate into a
wheat field, and stood looking at the
standing grain on all sides.
It was a rich piece of bottom-land,
in a hollow. On one side was the riv< r,
from which the ground was irrigated.
But as he stooped to examine a head
of wheat he drew it closer in amaze
ment and put his glasses on more firm
ly. Each grain had been skilfully re
moved and the head stood on the stalk
empty.
"This is very strange," said he.
"Yes," answered the boy; "that's the
way it mostly happens hereabouts."
Professor Grosvolt, after some labor,
caught some specimen bugs and put
them under a powerful magnifying
glass. He jumped backward in sur
prise, scarcely daring to believe in his
eyes. Before him. under the glass, hs
saw minute human beings, dressed in
queer garments and looking in face and
form like people of the nineteenth cen
tury. They were running around on the
plate and seemed greatly frightened
and distressed.
Investigating, he learned that these
little beings had undermined the wheat
field and built cities, which were won
ders of . architectural beauty. Their
granaries were full of wheat and vari
ous farm products, and their only care
seemed to be to gather in all that was
raised by the farmers. They had ap
parently time for the practice of learn
ing quite foreign to the farmers, who
tilled the soil and sent in reports as tv
their depredations.
The professor studied them for some
time, and often lamented their curious
position, and longed to be able to reach
and elevate them to a higher plane and
have them recognized by the citizens
at large. The idea was generous, but
they were no larger than specks and
could not be reached in any way, al
though they seemed to be intellectual.
They could not stand on an equal foot
ing with other citizens, and must be
classed as parasites!
AVhle the professor sat in his room
at the hotel and pondered over this
weighty matter the small boy carn^
running in, hatless and excited, to tell
him that a dam above, on the river, had
broken, and "Bug Hollow" had been
washed away.

have to do would be to dig out the gold
sell it to Uncle Sam and that I
would be able to sell all that I could
get. I have asked some friends if they
knew some rich man who has a gold

that the first thing I will do when I get

AMERICAN JOURNALISM.
By Hall Came.
Continued from Page Eighteen.
and call for your answer in an hour.'
"They put the manuscript on a side
board and went away.
"Half an hour later another man
came up. I thought he looked both
nervous and audacious.
"Our editor has sent me for Holmes'
story, and to know if you have decided
to review it,' he said.
" 'tfo, there it is still, take it away
with you,' I answered.
"Then, glancing up quickly, I saw the
man reaching out his hand for the
manuscript. There was a greedy look
in his eye, which made me uneasy.
'Wait,' I said, 'I'm an old journalist
myself, you know, and I think it would
be better form to give the thing back
to the men who brought it.'
" "Well, if you prefer to, ,' said
the fellow, and edged out.
"In half an hour more the two earlier
visitors returned. "I hope you've de
cided to do that review,' said one of the ' â¢
gentlemen. 'No, I've not, and I've told
your editor so already by the messen- j .
ger he sent a little while ago,' I replied. | .
"Then the men looked at me in blank j
astonishment. 'What messenger?' they'! ]
asked. I described the man who had j ,
come for the manuscipt. They stared â 
into each other's face.
" 'Good . It's that fellow on ,
the !'
"A journalist on a rival 'yellow' jour
nal, getting wind of their errand, had ;
tried to 'scoop' both the murderer's
manuscript and my review.
"Then I can give you a good story
of the American photographer who ac
companies the interviewer and whose
business it is to take snapshots of hi 3
subjects in characteristic and, if pog- I
sible. ridiculous attitudes, at unwary |
moments. One of the photographic
'hawks' came aboard the Campania in
the customs boat early on the morning
of our arrival in New York. For some ;
time he wandered about the ship, I
without doing anything which attract
ed my attention. . ,
"Then, as we steamed to the ship s
berth, his writing confrere came up to
me. The sun was shining, we were
standing upon the promenade deck, un
der the shade of the hurricane deck,
and he drew me to the ship's side while
he pointed out his own lodgings on the i
fourteenth floor of a lofty sky-scraper. J
I didn't feel an absorbing interest in his
story and I was rather at a loss to
know why he told it to me. A few
minutes afterward I heard him telling j
the same story to Lord Brassey.
"It began to strike me as funny that i
this person should be so zealously cir
culating such valuable information
about himself, when all at once I be
came aware that the snap-shot man
was usy behind him. The promenade i
deck was in the shadow, and this was
the place of collusion by which that
artful pair of hawks got their subjects
into the sun.
" 'You did him pretty well,' I said to
the photographer, when he had finished :
with Lord Brassey.
" 'Oh, he's not the first I've done, i
see!'
And the fellow showed me the list \
of his morning's 'takings.' The fiend
had got three separate snap-shots of
myself.
"Apparently there is no libel law in
America strong enough and swift i
enough to cope with the doings of the j
worst of the newspapers. When a New-
York newspaper published a false ac
cusation of myself and followed it up
by a still more false apology and I con
templated an action at law my friend,
Goldwin Smith, said: 'You might as
well take action against a mosquito.'
"While I was at Washington I dis
cussed this aspect of the lower Ameri
can journalism with an official of state,
who stands too high to be named in
such a connection.
" 'No libel law, however rigorous, will
meet the case,' he said. 'There's only
one thing that will meet it.' 'What's
that?' I asked.
" 'A horsewhip,' he answered.
"In the Bowery of New York I made
the acquaintance of a typical New
York boy, who had won laurels as a
prizefighter, and I found his views of
journalistic justice strangely similar,
with only some trifling differences as
to the means."
WILL HONOR FATHER SHEEHY
The Irish Patriot Priest to Be Pre
sented With a Testimonial.
The public of the city will have the
opportunity of again hearing Rev. Father
Sheehy, the Irish patriot priest, lecture
before his final departure for Ireland.
The lecture has been advertised for Feb
ruary 7. It will be on the subject of
"Topics of Special Interest in Ireland's
Past and Present."
Father Sheehy, before ho leaves the j
city, will be presented with a testimonial I
by many of the prominent Catholics of I
the city. A meeting for the purpose was !
held in the California Hotel last Tues- !
day evening. Thomas R. Bannerman j
was chosen president and R. J. Roche !
secretary.
In order to insure a perfect success of
the lecture it was decided that immedi- ;
ate steps should be taken to have a
crowded house to, greet him. in token of
his noble efforts as an Irish Nationalist i
for the cause of the motherland. Sev
eral addresses were made at the meet
ing, prominent among which was that de
livered by R. C. O'Connor. After con
sideration it was decided to call the la
dies in to assist in making the lecture
a success. Tickets were distributed at !
the meeting and undoubtedly the sales i
will be unusually large.- . â¢
The lecture promises to be one of the
most interesting and Instructive enter
tainments ever given in the city. It will |
be profusely illustrated- with views from
all parts of Ireland.

attempts. It was submitted to the ed
itor of the New York Star, and in it he
saw si i much wit a. nd originality that he
arranged for a series of them, paying her
for a single letter more than her salary as
a fashion writer. She then gave up the
latter work and devoted herself to news
paper writing, of which the Bab articles
were the most conspicuous examples.
The letters were widely copied, and at
â  the advice of friends she syndicated them,
receiving for her article weekly more
I than any other writer has ever bi>en
paid for a similar one. For twenty years
she has written these lettersâ bright,
breezy and up to date â when illness rob
bed her pen of its fluency and death for
ever laid it down.
In addition to her Bab letters for a long
time Mrs. Mallon had been associate ed
itor of The Ladies' Home Journal.
With her mother Mrs. Mallon had for
some years occupied apartments on
Fourth avenue, New York. They were
daintily and prettily furnished, as its
mistress was always faultlessly arrayed.
She had a womanly love of pretty things,
and the large sums that she realized
through her work enabled' h<r to gratify
her- taste.
Red was her favorite color. Her favorite
authors were Thackeray, Balzac and
Swinburne. Mrs. Mallon's ideal of beauty
was Mrs. Langtry at her best, "the most
beautiful creature 1 ever saw."' Rings
the was fond of, and although she liked
other trinkets she seldom wore .them. She
did not have much faith in women's love
of work for work's sake, and thought
that the present craze for self-support
would wear Itself out and the coming wo
man resume her conventional place In the
home, if she had one.
Although the dark-eyed, golden-haired
Bab, with her wit and talents and charm
of manner, had been admired by many,
she always preferred to remain faithful
to her first love.
"As for me," she would say, "I have
seen in my life as much happiness as
comes to one woman."
in her tiny drawing room stood a hand
some rosewood piano. In the old days
when she was a bride she and her hand
some young husband had often spent
happy evenings beside it, for they were
both music loving, but on the day he died
the piano was closed, and although others
have played upon it, from that day until
her own death she herself never touched
It.
Here are a few random selections from
some of the more recent Bab letters. It
will be noticed, as many of her readers
doubtless have noted, that Mrs. Mallon's
thoughts .of late turned continually
toward death:
"If you honor and respect every man,
woman, child and dog that you meet in
your daily walks; if you give the cour
tesy due them, you can be very certain
that respect will be shown you. The dog
you kick is going to bite. The woman to
HALES. |
whom you are rude is going to snub you.
The child you don't consider worth polite
ness is going to be impertinent. Where
you give honor and respect, my friend,
you will get them in return."
"Modesty is complex. The modest
woman is the one who wears her heart
where the daws cannot peck at it. and
who k?eps her own affairs to herself. She
is the woman who doesn't talk loudly in
public and who doesn't overdress. Mod
esty does not cover; it simply does not
recognize the existence of some sins.
There are women who are as exquisitely
modest as the ar.gels, women who could
put out their hands and lift up the other
woman who has fallen and never feel
they were soiling the tips of their fingers.
The modest woman is the charitable one,
for modesty and charity are twin sis
ters."
"I was glad as I walked along to be one
in that Easter procession on Fifth ave
nue. I was glad to be there because I
love to look at pretty women and dream
of lovely things. And there are so many
of both in the worldâ this great new
world, so rich in everything that is good
Somebody near me whispers that in a lit
tle while it will be all changed; others
will form the procession, and you and I
will beâ where? To-day we are not think
ing of that. We are thinking of the
pretty women and the flowers."â (Easter
And how many laughs conceal sorrow
ful hearts? How many smiles are masks
for sadness untold? Ah, my friend, you
Will see that the hardest part to play is
that of the jester, the one who always
laughs! Yet we can't go around with
tears in our eyes, with quivering lips and
throbbing hearts. Oh, no. You and your
neighbor have to put on a smile, have to
laugh with those who expect to luugh and
have to be glad, or appear to be so
whether the world has brought the good
things to you or to your neighbor."
"People are fond of saying that God is
just: but for me, I like to think of him as
merciful."
"To me there is nothing so fine as a
gentlewoman; but she Is the result of the
same good breeding that Is necessary to
make thoroughbred horses, and if'you will
take the trouble to look at it you will nnd
that the women who are clamoring to be
called Women with a capital \Y are thp
first of their kind. They are strong in
muscle and in brain, and in another gen
eration they will have the edges rubbed
off by the pumice-stone of society, for not
one of these women wants her'daue-hter
to be what she is." uaugnier

yet that is the art of living. It is worth
