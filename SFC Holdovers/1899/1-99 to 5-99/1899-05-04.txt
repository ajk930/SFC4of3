James Neal Plumb Slays One of the

Business Men.
Â»
Special Dispatch t" The Tall,
NEW YORK. May 3.â Alexander
Masterton, a director of the Farme.s'
Loan and Trust Company. 72 years
of age, was shot and killed this after
noon by James Neal Plumb in the
Burlington Hotel, on West Thirtieth
street. Masterton was shot five times
and died within an hour or two. The
murder was premeditated, as is evi
denced by a voluminous statement
written in advance by Plumb, and
given out after his arrest.
At present tlie real motive for the
crime is unknown. Plumb, In his state
ment issued "to the public," and en
titled 'Why I, J. seal Plumb, Shot
Alexander Masterton." declared that
he had been actuated to do the shoot
ing because of a systematical hounding
of him by Masterton. Plumb declared
.Masterton had not only ruined him
financially" but had attempted to alien
ate the affections of his wife and chil
dren and to cause his social downfall.
Plumb's statement, one copy of which
was addressed to the Associated Press,
deals with a period of his career em
bracing the past thirty-five years. It is
rambling in many places and concludes
*.\ ith the following:
No man has a higher regard for human
life than I have. But the just and right
eous punishment of Alexander Masterton
is decreed by an outraged God. and I am
simply the humble instrument In his
hand, as he has selected me as his chosen
instrument of wrathful vengeance. I
have rid the world of a man who is not
fit to live, and whose death a thousand
times over could never tone for the mon
strous wrongs done me.
Masterton and Plumb met by agree
ment in the Burlington Hotel at 1:30
p. m., in the apartments occupied by
Manager Cole. They had been there
but a short time when five ahotfi *ver.
tired In rapid succession. Plumb then
came out and walked inter the reception
room, awaiting arrest. The murderer
was taken before Police Captain Price
of the Tenderloin precinct, of whom he
is an intimate friend. .He was taken
later before a magistrate in the Jeffer
son Market Police Court and held.
In his statement Plumb writes as fol
lows:
The reason for taking this serious step
was that for upward of thirty-five years,
commencing as far back as 1862, at the
time of my marriage engagement, this
man has followed me like a Bleuthhound
irorn that time to this, and yet I was
never able to discover the cause or mo
tive of his animosity toward me. as when
he commenced to attack me I had never
seen the man or ever heard of him.
Again in 1885, .ii my return from Cali
fornia, after three years' absence, he* at
once renewed the intrigues against me
in my family and in public, secretly do
ing me all the injury in his power, so
cially and financially.
After all these years, down to 1876, this
man was constantly plotting and conspir
ing against me, endeavoring to under
mine my wife's confidence in me by
covert insinuations, and endeavoring in
every way to alienate the affections of
my wife and children, and he had a pow
erful influence, being the trustee of my
wife's large estate.
In 1877 Mrs. Plumb died in Paris and
Plumb returned here and went to live
at Islip, L. l. lb recites a number of
circumstances showing Masterton'a al
leged conspiracy to alienate the affec
tions of his children, a French maid
acting as spy for Masterton. Plumb re
fers to another "conspiracy," begun in
InS5. which he says is known to his
friends in New York and Washington
as the "Washington conspiracy," where
his eldest da tighter, Minnie, laid a trap
for Masterton and his lawyers by
means of decoy letters and telegrams.
His enemy fell Into the trap and did
not know he had been entrapped until
Plumb's daughter displayed the motive
of these telegrams in Surrogate Rollins'
court during an action brought in con
nection with the case.
After reciting the story of the mar
riage of his son, J. I vers Plumb, in
ISBS, with a woman named Anna Bur
ton, of whom he speaks in no com
plimentary terms, and laying the blame
for this undesirable marriage at Mas
terton's door, he refers to what he calls
the last conspiracy of Alexander Mas
terton, which has culminated his long
years of cruel, vindictive oppression by
his punishment reed by an out
raged God."
He says that soon after his son's
graceful marriage," he went to
Europe, intending to make his home in
Southampton, England, and he and his
daughters were as happy there as they
could be with a cloud hanging over
them In the moral death of his son.
He next refers to the kidnaping of
his daughter Leonita in 1 588, after they
had returned to New York. She was
forced Into a carriage by the agents
of Masterton, he avers, and taken to
the Victoria Hotel. Later she was
taken to Troy. She subsequently re
gained her freedom. The object of the
abduction. Plumb claims, was to force
the girl to give up her father. Plumb
declares the wrongs which Masterton
had done him no law could reach. His
words are:
"The man who brought all this trou
ble in my declining years no law can
reach."
In addition to these conspiracies
Plumb goes into lengthy details re
garding the alleged efforts of Master
son and others to bring about a mar
riage between one of his daughters and
a worthless fortune-seeking English
man, who had made the boast that he
"could win the little American miss."
Plumb appeared cool Immediately
upon his arrest, but when at the police
station word came that Masterson had
died, Plumb broke down and said, "it
had to be."
A chambermaid at the Burlington,
l ho was th" only one near the room in
which the shooting occurred, told the
police that she heard the men in angry
conversation just before she heard the
Pistol shots. One of the men, she saidâ

APIA, Samoa, April 27 (via Auckland. N. Z., May 3). â
Mataafa, the rebel chieftan, has accepted an armistice.

COGHLAN'S SPEECH
HELPS THE KAISER
TO A NEW NAVY
BERLTN, May 3.â The Coghlan inci
dent, 1 am told, worried his Majesty
! the Kaiser not a little at first. Full
i details were cabled to him from Wash
ington and led to a long confferenca
with Count Wolff -Metternich, who on
his trips accompanies his Majesty as
the representative of the Foreign Of
fice.
What shocked him most was the lack
|of discipline in an officer under any
circumstances permitting himself such
liberties of comment. In Germany any
such breach would be summarily pun
ished, but its occurrence would be a
; thing unheard of. The Kaiser felt the
affront all the more because he consid-
I ers that he long ago made the amende
honorable when he personally rebuked
Admiral yon Deiderichs, recalled him
and placed Prince Henry in his place,
with instructions to be specially con
ciliatory to Americans.
All that is over and the disagreeable
incidents referred to are more than a
year old and therefore are considered as
bygones. But in the whole affair the
Kaiser has found consolation, because
out of it he has extracted yet another
fact which would appeal to the German
nation in the cause which he has had
at heart for yearsâ the increase of the
German navy. Captain Coghlan can
take it that in this dinner he has been
the ally of the Kaiser.
Yesterday I was talking with one of
the most peace-loving men in this coun
try, but even he had become a jingo on
the' question of an increase of the navy.
The newspapers are more than ever
full of the same subject. There is abso-

Alexander Masterton was a leading
resident of Mount Vernon, where he oc
cupied a handsome home with his wife
and two daughters. Mrs. C. B. Tibbats
and Mrs. W. H. Ferris. He was for
merly connected with the old Manu
facturers' and Merchants' Bank of
New York, and later was interested in
the Farmers' Loan and Trust Com
j pany. He had the management of
many estates, and was interested

sage relative to the suspension of hos
tilities, as it was the desire of the three
governments during the investigation
to be made by the commission that
peace and order should exist in the
island. In view of this well-known de
sire surprise is expressed at the re
ported refusal of Herr Rose to sign the
proclamation unless it contained some
expressions which he regarded as in
juring Germany's cause.
In view of the dispatch from Auck
land it is expected by the department
that it will receive a message within
the next twenty-four hours from Rear
Admiral Kautz reporting the situation.
Under his instructions he is required
to communicate with the department
as often as possible.
lutely no doubt that in the immediate
future a measure for a large increase
in the German navy will be submitted j
by the Government and carried in the j
face of recent events. V â¢:,
It has been said concerning the peace
conference, which has been described as
a modern phantasmagoria born under
great difficulties, that the Kaiser would
take this opportunity for making some
proclamation as to his sentiments of
amnesty to all political prisoners. This
is without foundation. His Majesty has
no sentimental ideas about the possi
bilities of universal peace. His voice
is to be heard in his appointment of
an apostle of increased . armaments,
Professor Stengel, as counselor to the
Count yon Munster. His Majesty has
often expressed his opinion that peace
can only be maintained by being pre
pared .for war, by having the force
necessary to command respect. Since
the Spanish war he realizes more than
ever that his theory is right.
"How long will the peace conference
last?" I asked of one who will take
part in it.
"It is difficult to say," he replied,
"but we may count on a month or six
weeks, according to how the delegates
agree as to the best means of assuring
peace. All we know definitely now is
that the various governments have se
cured rooms for their delegates at The
Hague for the 17th inst., that the con
ference will begin on the 18th, and that
until the delegates do meet there will
be no programme announced. Some of
the delegates up to the present time
have received absolutely no instruc
tions." '.'*'â '.".

WARDNER, Idaho. May 3.â A1l day
I long the work of arresting the men be
lieved to have been connected with the !
Bunker Hill outrages has been in
progress. To-night 104 prisoners are
under guard in the barn that has been
turned Into a jail for their detention.
Among them are many ringleaders in
the organization. More of the chief
dynamiters, however, have fled and are
now getting out of the country as best
they may. Their capture is a matter of
time.- They will not escape. The State
, will go bankrupt, if necessary, in order
to bring about their conviction.
By 10 o'clock this morning the work
of drawing the formal complaint
against the more notorious strikers had
A been completed. The document was a
lengthy one, and in it were set down
the names of about fifty suspects. Then
the work of making the arrests com
menced.
As martial law had not at that time
been declared, the local constables were
deputed to serve the warrants, but
they were not alone in the work. Cap- j
tain Batchelor of Company M put a
squad of his colored fighters at the
command of the constables, and they
began the hunt. Up to the head of the
gulch marched the pursuers, and then,
turning back, they commenced a search
of every point where the rioters might
be in concealment. Their coming in
caused a panic among the strikers.
. There was a wild scramble among them
i up the sides of the canyon, but they
were not to escape in that way. As
> they dodged through the brush on the
. mountain side the constables and their
. deputies started in pursuit, and in most
. cases the chase was a short one.
. The sight of the dusky soldiers' erlis
â¢ tening rifles was generally sufficient to !
make them meekly surrender. Lined
' up two abreast and oo]_*ely guarded by '
' the soldiers, the captives were marched
. back down to the camp at the station
in little bunches of twenty or thirty.
i There they were turned into a vacant
: lot and kept under guard until about
5 o'clock, when they were transferred
, to the loft of a near-by barn.
While the arrest of the men in Ward
ner was under way searching parties of
soldiers, headed by the newly created
constables, were sent out all around
the surrounding country to pick up the
fugitives. â ;.:/, -.->â¢â 
As it was known that many rioters
were trying to escape over the hills
toward Harrison. Auditor Sinclair, who
is in charge of the campaign, engaged
a special train, which was rushed down
there. It brought hack five strikers.
Five or six more armed with rifles were
seen from the train, but owing to the
nearness of other trains it was impos
sible to stop the special and start in
pursuit of them.
Among the men under arrest are five
or six Deputy Sheriffs, who were ele
vated to that office by Deputy Sheriff
Bell since the trouble started.
WHITE PASS LOCOMOTIVE
CRUSHED BY AVALANCHE
Immense Slide on the Trail to Daw
son Wrecks One of the En

VICTORIA, B. C, May 3.â The usual
springtime avalanches are occurring on
the White Pass. According to late ar
rivals from the trail many slides have oc
curred during the past month, although
fortunately none have yet been the cause
of any loss of life as far as can be as
certained. The deadly avalanche, how
ever, is responsible for the derailment of
an engine of the White Pass and Yukon
Railway with considerable damage to the
Arctic Iron horse. It was on April 27 that
the slide took place. A heavy mass of
snow and Ice, carrying quite a quantity of
earth and general debris with it. swept
down the hillside on the White. Pass and
Yukon track, about midway between
Glacier and the tunnel above that station.
It struck an engine standing there and
swept it from the rails. The locomotive
was badly Injured, but no further damage
was done. A large mass of snow and ice
covered the track for some distance. Men
were put on to clear It. and it was ex
pected that traffic would not be delayed
long.

MERRITT IS
ANXIOUS TO
OUST MILES
Explanation of His Fulsome
Praise of General
Alger.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW TORK, May The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele-
graphs: Considerable comment has
been caused in army circles here by
Major General Merritt's fulsome praise
of Secretary Alger, in his speech in
Detroit, last night, before the Michigan
Society of Sons of the Revolution.
Several of the officers on duty at the
War Department recalled that thirty
five years ago General Merritt placed
an indorsement on General Alger's
record which caused an enmity be
tween the two men lasting from that
day until about a year ago. Then the
difficulty was patched up by the action
of Secretary Alger in tendering Gen
eral Merritt the command of the ex
pedition to Manila and to placing at
his disposal all the troops and supplies
needed to make the expedition success
ful.
Army officers with whom I talked
ridiculed General Merritt's change of
mind. In 1864 he wrote upon the papers
regarding General Alger's absence
without leave: "Severe measures
should be taken to prevent a recurrence
of this evil."
In 1899 he declares that Secretary
Alger "is the best Secretary of War
the world has ever seen."
It has been hinted for some time
that it is General Merritt's ambition
to be commanding general of the army.
It is known that at one time General
Alger strongly urged the President to
appoint him as successor to General
Miles. General Miles, however, has not
been relieved and General Merritt will
be placed on the retired list next year
in all probability, as commanding gen
eral of the Department of the East. â¢

OPPOSED TO
TEACHING OF
EVOLUTION
Important Decision Is Ex
pected Soon From
Rome.
Special Dispatch to The Tall.
NEW TORK, May According to
current report in Catholic circles an
other Important decision is expected
soon from Rome. It will affect the
scientific teaching of evolution as op
posed to special creation. It is said
that in ecclesiastical circles the opinion
is that the decision will be adverse to
the theory of evolution. As in other
recent controversies that have agitated
Catholic circles ' the inspection and
propagation of this new cult in Ca
tholicism comes from the West. In
its teaching the most ardent advocates
have been friends and associates of
Archbishop Ireland. Notably prominent
as a leader of this school of thought
is Rev. Dr. John Zamm, once professor
of science at Notre Dame . University,
but now superior in America of the
teaching and missionary order known
as the Fathers of the Holy Cross, nu
merous and popular in the West. Rev.
Dr. Zamm is the author of several
widely known volumes, notably those
entitled "Catholic Science and Scien
tists," "Bible Science and Faith" and
"Dogma and Evolution."
Although he had long been held in
special repute as a scientist wider at
tention was drawn to his views by a
series of lectures he delivered three
years ago at the sessions of the Catholic
Summer School at Plattsburg, N. Y. In
these his advanced themes on the an
tiquity of the world, the time God took
to create it, the extent of the Noachian
deluge and the compatibility of certain
evolutionary processes with the Catho
lic faith and dogma created sharp and
extended, criticisms. In publications
recognized as speaking for the Jesuits
the appropriateness and advisability of
such speculative theories as a part of
Catholic teachings were strongly de-
nied. Â , 9.
- After the subject had been widely dis
cussed Dr. Zamm was called to Rome.
It was known that his theories had
been referred to a commission of Car
dinal's, to be investigated and passed
upon and It was thought he would be
disciplined. But he was received with
honor made a doctor of philosophy and
later the representative of his order in
Rome as procurator general. He was
then sent back to the United States as
superior of the order here.
Nothing was heard of the Cardinals'
investigation until the present report
that they will find against the evolu
tion theory. '

MEETS STRONG
RESISTANCE
The Filipinos Set Another
r Town on Fire Before
Abandoning It.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, Thursday, May
â The American forces
under General Mac A
rthur this morning attacked a
large force of insurgents, well
intrenched, near San Tomas, a
few miles northwest of Calum
pit. They are meeting with
stubborn resistance and seem
unable to make any impres
sion upon the enemy.
Fire has broken out in a
score of places in the be
leaguered town, which is
taken as an indication that
the insurgents are preparing
to evacuate.
MANILA, May 3, 8 p. m.â Fili
pino envoys. Major Manuel Arguelezs
and Lieutenant Jose Bernal, have
abandoned the pretense under which
they came to General Otis, that they
represented General Antonio Luna, and
to-day announced that they came as
representatives of Aguinaldo himself.
The two emissaries used all their wiles
to secure a reply from General Otis to
the letter from Senor Mahini. Agui
naldo's Prime Minister and Minister of
Foreign Affairs in the dictator's Cabi
net, which they presented yesterday,
but General Otis refused to make any
reply, on the ground that to do so
would be equivalent to a recognition
of the so-called government of the
Filipinos.
â¢ Arguelezs said that Aguinaldo knew
he would be overpowered in time, but
that he would be able to continue' the
fight for months and that he would do
so unless he were given what Major
Arguelezs termed "peace with dignity."
Mr. Schurman. president of the
United States Philippine Commission,
expresses . the opinion that the inter
views accorded by General Otis to the
Filipino representatives* will have a
good moral effect as tending to con
; vince Aguinaldo's representatives that
i the American authorities mean to give
the Filipinos a good government, and
not one of the Spanish sort.
Certainly it has had a civilizing in
' fluence in inducing them to observe the
S amenities of war and consent to the
I Americans furnishing food for Ameri
' can prisoners.
The exodus of natives from the mi
i surgent lines continues.
By filling in the roads where it was
required, putting canoes on the rivers
, and plowing fields south of Malolos, the
: army is in a fine position for the ex
pected decisive blow.
General Mac Arthur has moved his
headquarters to San Vicente, across the
j Rio Grande. General Wheaton's brig-
I ade has advanced beyond Alapit.
General Hale has returned to co
' operate with General Lawton. At Bali-
I bag last evening there was a running
] fight, during which one* soldier was
i killed and three wounded. The rebels
j scattered before General Law*ton and
General Hale.
Yesterday, while Captain Wheeler
with a detachment of the Fourth Cav
alry was covering General Hale's ad
vance, he discovered a large body of2
rebels at Fulilan. The cavalry opened J
fire, but there was no response. Think- l
ing that the rebels wanted to surrender
Lieutenant Bell went forward to par
ley with them. The Filipinos replied
that they did not wish to surrender,
but that they had been ordered to re
frain from fighting during the negotia
tions. They asked what Lieutenant j
Bell wanted and In response were given
half an hour in which to retire, which |
they Improved, j
A Spanish prisoner who escaped Into
the American lines reports that after
General Hale's advance on Quingan
two hundred Filipinos were burled,
thirty-five in one trench and twenty
seven in another. This is the largest
.number of rebels that have been killed
in any engagement for several months.

SHOT BY A CLIENT,
WHO KILLS HERSELF
A Chicago Lawyer Probably Fatally
Wounded by a Young Woman
Without Provocation.
CHICAGO, May 3.-David J. Wit.-, an
attorney, lies at the Post Graduate Hos
pital probably fatally wounded by three
shots fired by a young woman named
Mabel Blrk. After wounding Wlte, Miss
Birk shot and killed herself.
The shooting occurred this afternoon in
a parlor of the Hotel Anthony. Accord
ing to the lawyer's statement, he had met
.Miss Birk in a professional way only.
He met her on the street to-day acci
dentally, he claims, and the young wo
man asked him to accompany her to the
hotel, where she would sing for him.
Wite was seated on the piano stool, run
ning over the keys, when without any
warning his companion shot him three
times. One of the bullets struck Wite
just above the small of the back, an
other lodged in his neck and a third
back of his right ear. The single missile
which ended the life of the young wo
man penetrated the breast.
Wite is well known in Chicago legal
circles and has a considerable practice.
He is married. He says he cannot con
ceive of any reason for the young wo
man's act.

REDWOOD CITY, May 3.â took the
entire morning and until 3 o'clock this
afternoon to complete the jury to try ex-

who was driving the wagon on which
Johnston rode, described the killing. To
morrow the cross-examination of Baccari

TOWER WANTS RUSSIA TO
ARBITRATE SEALING CLAIMS
NEW YORK, May 3.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Embassador
Tower, the new representative of this
country in Russia, is strongly pressing
the St. Petersburg Government for a set
tlement of the sealing claims filed by
American citizens.
The-** claims, amounting to about
$300,000, have been pending for several
years, and though they have been brought
repeatedly to the attention of the Rus
sian Minister of Foreign Affairs, no set
tlement has been effected.
Embassador Tower has proposed to the
Russan Government that the claims be
arbitrated, and he understands that the
proposition is being seriously considered.
The claims are said by officials of the
State Department to be well based, and
they are confident that If presented to an
Impartial arbitrator he will find in favor
of the claimants.
PRICE OF REFINED
SUGAR HAS ADVANCED
NEW YORK, May 3.â The American
Sugar Refining Company to-day advanced
the price of all refined sugars sold by it
one-eighth of a cent per pound. Standard
granulated was placed at 5% cents,
, against .V cents yesterday and ">** cents
I a month ago. The move was quickly fol
lowed by all . the independent refineries.
The current advance was really begun in
London, where refined sugar prices have
been hardening for some days. It was
forced by the decided firmness in raw
sugar, which cut down decidedly the mar
gin of refiners' profits. Imports of raw
sugar into the United States during March
increased 102,000,000 pounds over 'March,
1898, and in the nine months since last
June the increase was fully a thousand
! â million pounds.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CLARA, May 3.â The Forest
ers of America, in grand court assem
bled, were out very early this morning,
notwithstanding that the degree of S.
I". C. was conferred on sixty candidates
last night. Grand Chief Ranger J.
Samuels called the Grand Court to or
der at 10 o'clock. The grand officers
submitted their annual reports. The
question of biennial sessions was taken
up and provoked an extended discus
sion. The vote was: Ayes, 111; noes,
64. There not being two-thirds in fa
vor the question was lost and the
Grand Court will meet a.gain next year.
San Luis Obispo will have the honor
of entertaining the Grand Court next
time. The advantages of four places
were set forth, but that city won from
Chico, Petaluma and San Francisco.
In the afternoon the election of offi
cers took place, with the following re
sults: Grand chief ranger, Judge J.
W. Hughes, Sacramento; grand sub
chief ranger, Hugo K. Asher, San Fran
cisco; grand treasurer, Frank Conklin,
San Francisco; grand secretary, i John

â H. A. Gabriel, Santa Clara (by ac
clamation); Dr. George Pasche, Los
Angeles; E. Lampe, San Francisco. The
only contests were on the election of
junior beadle and trustees.
An adjournment was taken until 9
o'clock to-morrow. The flrst business
to come up in the morning is the elec
tion of supreme representatives. These
are the most coveted offices and there
are thirty or more candidates, with
thirteen to be elected. It is impossible
to forecast the result. The several can
didates have all they can do to keep
their fences in repair. Combinations
are made, only to be broken in an hour.
In many respects the scenes around the
hotels and clubs remind one of political
conventions. However, every one is
good-natured and those who will be
defeated to-morrow are prepared to
make graceful submission. ', -
The remaining business to be tran
sacted to-morrow will be the considera
tion of resolutions heretofore intro
duced. There are several proposed
amendments to the constitution to be
acted upon. One is to elect Officers by
secret instead of open ballot. The spe
cial committee to consider the placing
of State organizers in the field will
probably submit a report.
This evening Senator E. I. Wolfe de
livered an address on the benefits of
the order to a large audience at Wid
ney Hall. This was followed by a
dance. A banquet will take place to
morrow night.

LOUISVILLE, Ky.. May 3.-Four good
i colts, game and true, with two more
whose chances to start will be governed
entirely by the weather conditions, will
face the starter to-morrow in the twenty
fifth renewal of the Kentucky Derby. The
city is crowded with visitors and good
judges predict that the largest crowd ever
seen at Churchill Downs will witness the
struggle, provided the day is fair. The
track is in superb condition.
Manuel will be the choice of the talent,
with Corsine and His Lordship well sup

by anybody who can remember the name
of his owner, John F. Madden. In his
I trials Manuel has shown a mile and a
I quarter in 2:10%. while Corslne's best time
for the Derby route has been 2:15. His
Lordship has negotiated the distance in
2:12, and Mazo has passed over the route
in 2:13 i.
As far as looks go there is little to
choose between the starters. All are fit

RACES AT REDDING.
REDDING, May 3.â The second day of
the race meeting here proved as Interest

large and the betting as heavy. The only
bad feature in the programme was the
delay in starting, especially in the first
race. In the second heat of that event
it was necessary to give the horses a
standing start after a half-hour's Jock
eying. Many are still of the opinion that
Black Bess, who was distanced ln th*
third race, could beat her opponent with
another trial. Black Bess' rider fell off
just after the start because of his stir

LOS ANGELES, May 3.â A drunken Mexican confined in the cala
boose at San Gabriel for assault on 14-year-old Maria Valenzuela,
broke jail yesterday in a somewhat remarkable way.
The prison is a stone building containing one room. A small open
ing, barred with two pieces of 2x4 scantling, admits light and air. On
Monday morning Mrs. M. S. Wilson, wife of the Justice of Peace, saw
a prisoner climb through the opening and escape. She notified the
Constable. He found that the Mexican, had gnawed one of the scant
lings apart, and although he had handcuffs on, succeeded in escaping.
Yesterday he found the Mexican in an abandoned adobe hut at San
Gabriel Mission. The recaptured assailant steadfastly refuses to reveal
his name or speak regarding his crime. He is a stranger in San Ga

CRANIUM'S SHAPE
DECIDES DESTINY
Theory Being Exploited
by Scientists.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May 3.â
Dr. C. C. Closson of Harvard, a gradu
i ate in sociology, is at present at Stan
' ford University engaged in measuring
the heads of students in the gymnasium
to determine certain questions of
heredity. He takes the length and
breadth of the skull and asks questions
concerning the occupation, character,
health and movements of the student's
ancestry. 'Dr. Closson is one of a new
school of scientists who are studying
anthropology, with a particular view to
: the effect of the shape of the human
! head on race movements and develop
-1 ments.
Interest in the matter originated
' after the report of a commission or
i ganized in the Grand Duchy of Baden,
j under the direction of Lapouge, to ob
' tain a scientific description of the popu
lation. The scientists found there was
a difference between the shape of the
j heads of the urban and rural popula
tion. * The large majority of the latter
I were of a broad headed or Alpine type,
while the former were found to be long
or narrow leaded. As the latter type,
j which is now called the North Euro
j pean type, is the more energetic, ner
-1 vous and migratory, the theory was
! advanced that this difference in race
psychology might account for the
movements of men and nations.
The Baden commission, examined 20,
--! 000 persons; It found that the mass of
: the upper class were of the long-headed
i type, and also that the most of the
persons who moved from the country
Into the city possessed the same head
characteristics. It was shown that the
j narrow-headed type had smaller fam
ilies and the tendency was for the type
to decrease. Further investigation re
vealed that this type of man dwelt
chiefly in the north of Europe, and that
it has taken more than its share in the
migratory movements to the United
States. As the examinations extended
' over the south Of Germany it was dis
covered that the broad-headed type
predominated, both there and in
France.
The results seemed to go to prove a
nascent selection in society, which has
a great sociological interest, and a
number of eminent scientists de
termined to secure further data. Dr.
Callignon investigated in France, and
others in Austria and Switzerland.
They even went so far as to seek in
formation in the catacombs, and it is
now alleged by them that the great
movements in Roman and French his
tory can be traced to these differences

i America being a new country, built
:up principally by emigrations from
Europe, the men interested in the study
are attempting to verify the findings
of the Baden commission by experi
ments in the United States. It is con
tended that where the broad-headed
type have emigrated they will be
found principally in the East, while the
long-headed type pushed on, and are
primarily responsible for the settle
ment of the West. It was thought that
a representative test could be made
easiest by the examinations of college
students and the members of large so
cieties or clubs. Dr. Sasgent of Har
vard has had examinations made in the
gymnasium there and Dr. Ripley at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and at Columbia, while Dr. Closson
came West.
He first examined the German,
French and Swiss inhabitants of Los
Angeles, and it was discovered that the
large majority of them belonged to the
long-headed type. Although the reports
of the American examinations have not
been published, it is said that every test
so far made has strengthened the the
ories. If this extensive study of stu
dents in the East and West is satis
factory the examinations will no longer
have to be made by individuals upon
their own responsibility, but the mat
ter will become of sufficient importance
to be taken up by colleges and scientific
societies. "

TWO MOURNERS
AT HER GRAVE
Mrs. Hassell Buried at
Stockton.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, May 3.â The Hassell -
Hickman inquest to-day was a formal
affair. The jury promptly found that
Mrs. Hassell shot her companion and
then ended her own career.
H. Addison Hassell, husband "of the
Countess, testified that after his mar
riage his wife had confessed that in
England she had experienced a strange
infatuation for a woman. Speaking of
Mrs. Hickman, whom she had but re
cently met, Mrs. Hassell sain she felt
that she could love that woman. Mrs.
Hassell, it is said, was jealous of Hick
man, the husband of her victim.
Edith Cox, Mrs. Hassell'u former
maid, came to the defense of her for
mer mistress in a statement to-day, in
which she said substantially that while
Mrs. Hassell might have been eccentric
she was nevertheless oft correct life.
She declared both of the women must
have committed suicide and refused to
believe Mrs. Hassell was guilty of mur
der.
The murderess was a remarkable
woman. She talked French, was a
pianist of marked ability and had a
cultured voice. She rode well and in
dulged in any and all athletics, from
swimming to fencing.
The funeral of Mrs. Hassell occurred
to-day. Hassell and Miss Cox were the
only mourners, and the pallbearers,
numbering six, made up the party that
gathered at the grave. .There were
flowers and a pretty burial service was
read by the Rev. Dr. Evans of the
Methodist church.
Mrs. Hickman will be buried to-mor
row. Mrs. Hickman was highly con
nected and more than one family feels
the gloom and shock of the affair.

FOR A BIG ESTATE
A Battle Begun for Vast Property
Interests.
-
Mrs. Pauline Franklin Sued by a Redskin
Woman Who Claims to Be the Lawful
Widow of Julius L. Franklin.
TWO complaints will be filed in the
County Clerk's offlce to-day which
will fall like a bomb on the house
hold of Mrs. Pauline Franklin. The
â¢plaintiff in both suits is Mary Franklin.
T. :. Indian man, who declares herself
to be the lawful *vldow of Julius L.
Franklin, and who will ask the courts to
give her a one-half interest in all the
real property owned by him and also a
one-half interest ln certain personal prop
erty that has been transferred to Mrs.
Pauline Franklin. Both suits Involve
nearly a half-million dollars and the legit
imate rights of wifehood of a woman who
has for almost three decades borne the
name of Julius 1.. Franklin.
There is offspring from both unions.
The living Issue of the first, some of
whom have contested the will of Julius
Franklin, who died on December 20, IST9,
are two children, Ben Franklin, aged 35,
and Mrs. Mollle Wilson,, aged 31, and a
grandchild. Karl Porter, the son of Mrs.
Lena Porter. The children of the second
union are well known in this city. They
are .Philip and Harry Franklin and Ber
tha Solomons, the wife of Frank Solo
mons.
The complaints re highly sensational
in character, inasmuch as they accuse
Mrs. Pauline Franklin, a woman of the
highest reputation in this community, as
being the cause of all the suffering and
exclusion of Mary Franklin, the dusky
plaintiff, from her community rights in
the estate of Julius L. Franklin.
The great amount of money involved
ami the picturesque background lends a
romantic interest to what promises to be
a protracted lawsuit and in which some
six attorneys have been engaged on one

Eide alone. It will be a legal battle for
the partition of a vast estate, for the
surrender of large vested interestsâ all of
the property is in the name of Pauline
Franklinâ and the arduous undertaking to
prove the rights of the first wife.
Julius L. Franklin was one of the pio
neers of the Northwest. He began his
adventurous life as a fur trader in Brit
ish Columbia, making friends of the
chiefs of the tribes and building up a
large and remunerative trade. This con
tinued for some years, during which time

TIRED-OUT NERVES
Many Disorders Are Di-

**â¢ Nerves.
HOW TO OVERCOME A CONDITION THAT
MAY LEAD TO SERIOUS EVIL
Tears devoted to the study of the nervous
system, and the application of remedies to
debilitated condition- of the nervous system,
has led to the discovery of the great HUDYAN,
the wonderful specific that nature Intended for
the rebuilding of weakened nerves. Besides
those diseases, that relate directly to the
nerves, such as Nervous â  haustii m, Nervous
Prostration, Nervous Debility, Epilepsy, st.
Vitus Daace, we have weakened conditions of
the Stomach, the Heart, the Liver, the Kid-
neys, the Lungs, that are due to a weakened
condition of the r.erves tnat govern these
organs. HUDYAN will cure all such disorders,
There is no remedy on earth that will relieve
and cure Nervous Dyspepsia so quickly as
Will HUDYAN. In most Instances those dis- ,
orders peculiar to women are solely .vie to
â  weakened nerves. HUDYAN will correct the
evil. HUDYAN has a peculiar remedial ef-
fect upon broken-down nerve tissue that no
other remedy possesses.
'â VAN will restore broken-down constitu-
tions. It will Infuse new life and vigor into
weak, exhausted systems. HUDYAN furnishes
* Ftrength and nourishment for the nerves.
If you cannot sleep well or if you suffer with
headaches, you need HUDYAN. It will re-
lieve these conditions and remove the cause
Of them within a few hours. HUDYAN Is
soothing to the nerves, and yet li contains
no narcotic drugs. The weakest stomach In
this world will tolerate HUDYAN.

the fur trader met the woman who is
now suing for a community share of
the fortune which he amassed in later
years. As the complaints filed yesterday
"recite. Julius Franklin and the plaintiff
were married on July 5, ISGI. Ten years
later, it is alleged, he deserted her.
The actual estate left by Julius Frank
lin, and of which Pauline Franklin is the
duly appointed executrix, did not amount
to more than $3000. The bulk- of his prop
erty, real and personal, had been trans
ferred to his second wife during the lat
ter years of his life. It consists of land
and Improvements in various parts of
the city, shares in the Spring Valley
Water Works, mortgage bonds of the
Market street railroad, shares of capital
stock in the San Francisco Gas and Elec
tric Company, the California Street Rail
road Company, the Alaska Packers' As
sociation, the Anglo-Californlan Bank. In
terests In $15,000 and $10,000 promissory
notes, secured by mortgages on real prop
erty and other choses in action. The abo
riginee now comes forward for one-half
of all this representation of wealth.
When Franklin quit the forset and the
camp he moved to Portland with his In
dian wife and children. He recognized
the offspring of the union as his own and
educated them in the ways of civiliza
tion. This period of life continued for
some years, until 1871, at which time, ac
cording to an allegation in the complaint,
the deceased deserted his first choice in
matrimony. After that there is a gap
in the life' of the former fur trader until
his second marriage and the beginning
of his business endeavors in this city.
The sensational allegation which ap
pears in both complaints reads as fol
lows:
"That at the time of the execution of
said Instrumentsâ the transferences of
property to Pauline Franklinâ Julius
Franklin and the defendant, Pauline
Franklin, were living together and hold
ing themselves out to the world as hus-
band and wife, and had been so living
! together for a period of twenty years.
"That during said period defendant,
Pauline Franklin, obtained a great de
! gree of influence and control over the
| mind and character of Julius L. Franklin
I and by means of constant importunities
j and persuasion unduly influenced him to
j execute the aforesaid instruments and to
; make over by gift and conveyance to her
! self all the property described therein, to
: the exclusion of plaintiff and in depriva
tion of her rights as the wife of said
j Julius Franklin, deceased. And In this
I behalf plaintiff alleges that Pauline
i Franklin at and prior to the execution of
the aforesaid instruments constantly rep
resented and stated to him that she was
his lawful and true wife and that this
plaintiff was not his wife, and therefore
not entitled to receive at his death any
portion of his property, and furthermore
stated to him that if he did not execute
: the aforesaid Instruments that after his
death this plaintiff would seek to enforce
the rights of a widow, and that great
loss might therefore be entailed upon said
defendant. Pauline Franklin; that at or
prior to the execution of the aforesaid in
strument Pauline Franklin constantly
stated and represent.- to Julius L.
Franklin that .this plaintiff, his true and
lawful wife, was, a woman of low origin,
ignorant, illiterate, uncouth and but a
i semi-civilized Indian squaw; that she this
plaintiff, was old, ugly and undesirable in
every respect as a wife and companion for
said Julius L. Franklin; that furthermore
this plaintiff was living in a foreign
country and that in all probability he.
Julius L. Franklin, would never see her
again; that the said plaintiff had no more
claim on him or his property; that it is
| true that this plaintiff Is of the American
â¢ Indian birth and for thirty years has
lived outside the State of California, sep
arate and apart from Julius Franklin, he
having deserted her in or about the year
i 1871; that by means of said statements" and
representations and the constant repeti
. tion thereof by Pauline Franklin, the
mind and affection of Julius L. Franklin
became alienated from this plaintiff, and
â¢he became persuaded that it was his
j moral duty to prevent this plaintiff from
ever having it in her power to enforce her
rights as a wife. That yielding to the said
I entreaties, importunities and representa-
I tions of defendant. Pauline Franklin.
Julius L. Franklin executed the aforesaid
I instruments."
The relief prayed for by the Indian wife
is multiplex. She not only asks for an
annulment of all the deeds of gift from
: Julius L. to Pauline Franklin and a de
cree that the latter acquired no title to
the transferred property, it* being the
community Interests of the parties of the
first marriage, but also for an accounting
of rents and profits accruing from its use,
an injunction restraining defendants from
. conveying or incumbering the property
and that a receiver should be appointed
pending the trial of the case.
The plaintiff is represented by J. F.
Riley F. H. Merzbach, L. Solomons and
Carter, Dozler ft Wells. One of the at
torneys undertook the trip to British
j Columbia, where he located the plaintiff,
Mary Franklin, and it is claimed that she

Strange Discovery of
Grave-Diggers.
â â¦ â
INTERRED EIGHTEEN YEARS
â â¦ â
REMAINS OF A MAN APPEAR
JUST AS IN LIFE.
Â»
Rare Case of Petrifaction, in Which
the Clothes and Hair Seem
to Have Defied
Time.
On Tuesday grave-diggers at the Lau
rei Hill Cemetery made a singular dis
covery. While they dug in quest of what
they believed to be a lot of withered
bones, the result of twenty years' inter
ment, they Were startled by the uncover
ing of a petrified body almost in as per
fect a state of preservation as on the
date of burial.
John W. Brown, a Prussian. 62 years
of age, died at Yokohama, Japan, o.n
April 24. 1881. Shortly after his death
he was brought to San Francisco and his
remains deposited in Laurel Hill Ceme
tery. Or) the same steamer which
brought the remains of Brown to this city
the body of a relative, H. O. Brown, who
died in Japan in LBBO, was also trans
ported. Both bodies were given a rest
ing-place side by side until Tuesday.
A short time ago relatives of the de
ceased men concluded to transfer the
remains of the men to a plat in an Ala
meda cemetery. a local undertaking es
tablishment was given the contract, and
its men went to the burial grounds Tues
day for the purpose of executing the rel
atives' wishes. With them they took two
small boxes. In these they expected to
gather the fragments of a pair of shriv
eled skeletons.
The grave of H. O. Brown was first
opened. His bones were heaped Into one
of the boxes. When the remains of John
Brown were reached the shovels of the
diggers struck some hard substance. It
was first thought to be bedrock, but in
vestigation proved that it had human
form and was perfectly clothed. Instant
ly picks and shovels were dropped and
the men, leaving their find untouched,
rushed to the cemetery office to spread
the information. Many people followed
them back, and the cold lump of apparent
stone was lifted to the surface. The un
dertakers were then obliged to wait for
another box, as the remaining receptacle
was not calculated to encase a life-size
body. When the coffin arrived Brown's
body was hastily taken to the undertak
ing parlors and kept behind closed doors.
Special effort was made to suppress the
story, but it soon had fallen on hundreds
of ears, and frequently during Tuesday
night a long line of the curious awaited
admission for the purpose of viewing the
strange case. They were all promptly
turned away. The relatives ordered a
very quiet reinterment, and yesterday
morning the body was wrapped in a her
metically sealed casket and shipped
across the bay.
Brown's body had been unnaturally pre
served. It had reached an advanced
stage of petrifaction and had endured the
ravages of a score of years of interment
without a shrink or a shrivel. Neither
had It swollen or twisted. From appear
ances the man tipped the scales at about
200 pounds in life and the present weight
of the body would probably approximate
those figures. The coffin had decayed
and fine earth had filtered through the
Intact clothing covering the body and
limbs. When this was scraped off, the
flesh was found to â.ave retained its nat
ural color.
The head and face had been protected
from the earth, and the skin color was
clearly preserved in some spots about the
forehead and temples. The muscles and
lines of the face were as plainly depicted
as on a living body, as were those of the
body and limbs. His hair, of a reddish
hue, was found neatly combed and his
mustache and goatee were as well pre
served as his body. Mummies when taken
from the sarcophagus, are generally be
yond recognition, but Brown was as nat
ural in apperance as on the day of his
death. His complexion had been of a
bronzed hue. and about the face where
the earth had not fallen, it had been con
siderably darkened by the dampness.
The clothing was in such a good state
of preservation that it had to be cut from
the body, and the shoes were in good con
dition, except that they were shrunk con
siderably. The cloth of his burial suit
was of a fine texture and retained . Its
firmness. Where it had not been too bad
ly stained by moistened earth the pattern
could be seen.
The body had become converted Into a
white fibrous substance and had not yet
reached the state of crystallization. The
fingers were pliable, and the arms and
legs could be moved slightly in their
sockets. The chest gave a little under
pressure, but the skin on the body was
solid as rock. .
NEW ROAD TO LAKE TAHOE.
The Line Will Follow a Picturesque
Course and Cross the Truckee
River Three Times.
D. L. Bliss, one of the constructors of
the new narrow-gauge railroad from
Truckee to Lake Tahoe, is authority for
the statement that the new survey for
the line will begin in a lew days. It will
be an entirely new survey. The first one
was made in May. 1897, and was on the
west side of the Truckee River. The one
now under consideration will run near
the old survey most of the way, but will
cross the river and go up on the east
side along the canyon above where the
Deer Park road turns off.
The road will run along the south side
of the Central Pacific Railroad track to
the Truckee Hotel. It is expected that
the latter company will build a sidetrack
so that trains can be backed down and
passengers and freight can be easily
transferred to the new line running to
Lake Tahoe.
Work on the construction of the road,
which will be fourteen miles long, will
be commenced about the middle of May
and will be completed in August. Work
will begin on the farther end of the" line
as the rolling stock and locomotives used
are to be transferred from Glenbrook on
the eastern shore of the lake. A substan
tial roadbed will be built. As the road
will cross the river three times as many
bridges will be constructed of steel. Two
passenger coaches and a baggage car
have already been purchased by the com
pany from the St. Louis Southeastern
Railroad. *.

RUINED HIS

Real Estate Firm.

HE WAS A TRUSTED PARTNER
â â
LEFT TWO WEEKS AGO AND
HAS NOT RETURNED.

He Went to Spanishtown to Collect
Funds, but Cleaned Out the
Safe Before Taking
His Departure.
â¦
Misplaced confidence in a partner with
whom he had been associated in business
for several years has proven the finan
cial ruin of _. A. Souc, the well-known
Mission real estate man. Albert Horiger,
the partner of Souc, has left foj parts un
known and he managed to take with him
all the ready cash of the 'firm, besides
leaving the books of th? concern in such
a jumble and chaotic state that it will
take an expert to ascertain the exact
amount of his peculations, which cover a
period of several ears. Despite this,
however, Souc has done the right thing
by the creditors of the firm. He has
turned over to Madison & Burke all of the
property and Attorney Bull of the firm
of Crandall & Bull declares that all of the
creditors will be satisfied and their losses
made good. There are about 170 separate
accounts which need adjustment and
these claims will amount to $1000. Madi
son & Burke on Tuesday collected 5750
due the firm and this amount will be used
first in liquidating some of the claims.
In the meantime Souc has notified the
j police of the disappearance of his former
J partner and everything will be done to
' apprehend Horiger in order that he may
: be brought back to answer for his mis
deeds. It is the same old story, only in
this Instance Horiger had no visible vices
such as gambling or drinking which
might have given Sotic any clew as to
what he was doing. Horiger has been in
San Francisco about six years. He came
here from Columbus, Ohio, and was to all
appearances an honest and thrifty fellow.
When the partnership was formed Hori
ger kept the bocks and did the office work
while Souc did the hustling on "the out
side. Two weeks ago yesterday Horiger
left for Spanishtown, saying that he was
going to collect some money that was due
the firm. He stated that he might prob
ably be gone a day or so. Nothing was
thought of the fact that he did not re
turn Immediately, but about the last of
the week Mrs. Smith of 431 Twenty-sev
enth street, with whom Horiger boarded,
came to the offlce with a note for one of
the employes of the office named Wallace
Gould. The note was from Horiger and
rtad as follows:
April IS, 1899.
Dear Wallace: If I should not get back to
the city you will please give to Jack (Mrs.
1 Smith's father) the $145 that we ' owe him out
! of the 1260 he loaned US, even if it is the last
money In the box. If I don't get any money in
; Spanishtown 1 will keep going and find some-
I thing to do. I can't stand the pressure if
anything happens. A. HORIGER.
This was the first intimation Souc had
that there was anything wrong. He then
made a hasty examination of the books
and found that they had not been kept
for the past two years and that they
were in a hopelessly mixed up state. Next
; skeleton keys were used to open the safe,
when it was found that It had been
cleaned of everything. It appears that
Horiger had been making a quiet "draw
down" all this time. Souc trusted him
completely, for to all appearances Hori
ger was a steady and hardworking man.
A* present Souc Is entirely broken up as
far as his business is concerned, but he

RETAIL GROCERS WILL
HAVE A GRAND OUTING
PREPARATIONS COMPLETE FOR
THEIR PICNIC.
Schuetzen Park Will Be Crowded
With Members and Friends on
Wednesday Next Long
List of Prizes.
For twenty-eight successive years the
wholesale grocers and the retail trade
have united to make the outing of the
local Retail Grocers' Association a suc
cess. This year extra efforts are being
put forth and the event, which comes off
on Wednesday, May 10, at Schuetzen
Park, will be marked by several unique
events and a number of prizes much out
of the ordinary.
Over COO prizes have already been con
tributed by the wholesale dealers who
always participate in the affair. More
still are promised and the various events
should be rich with prizes by next Wed
nesday.
Besides the usual races for all comers,
there will be special prizes at the shoot
ing range for the wholesale grocers, for
the commercial travelers and the press
representatives, as well as the retail gro
cers. There is also to be a "Massacre
(for prizes) of infant Filipinos" by the
city salesmen, who will be armed with
baseballs. Another queer event Is to be
a wooden shoe race for grocery clerks. In
which the winner must cross the line with
both shoes on. There will also be some
odd races for the little boys, while the
ladies will be given a chance to win
twenty-three prizes by guessing the num
ber of Inches ln an unwound ball of
twine.
For the retail grocers there is to be a
special drawing for a fifty-four-gallon
barrel of Kentucky whisky. There will
also be distributed a little over 400 articles
as gate prizes, to which every person en
tering the gates will have a chance.
A final meeting of the picnic committee
of the Retail Grocers' Association was
held last night, at which President Jo
seph A. Stulz presided. A long list of the
firms contributing prizes was read and
those who had promised prizes were also
enumerated. It was decided to have an
orchestra of forty pieces and two extra
trains were arranged for to accommodate
the crowds.
There is to be a final meeting of the
committee on Monday evening.
Larkspur Will Celebrate.
Arrangements are making at the village
of Larkspur for a big celebration to oc
cur on Sunday next, when the citizens of
that pretty resort will get together with
their hammers and saws to lav 2200 feet
of sidewalk from the postofflce to the
glen and camp ground.
Larkspur's one great need since the
camp there was opened has been a sub
stantial board walk, and finally the citi
zens and friends of the place have pooled
their spare cash and bought $300 worth
of lumber for the purpose. They will
build it themselves, and the day will be
made one of much celebration. There will
be a picnic at the glen and other festivi
ties, and a cordial invitation is extended
to every one to be present and assist in
the pleasure and work.
New 'â¢Owl" Schedule.
The Southern Pacific has announced a
change in time in the moving of the
"owl train to and from Los Angeles, to
take effect on and after Sunday next.
The "owl" will leave this city at 6
o'clock in the evening, instead of 5 o'clock
as at present, and will leave Los Angeles
at 5 o'clock, instead of at 5:30 as under
the present schedule. The train up from
Los Angeles will also carry a dining car
after that date, which will greatly add
to the convenience of the service. '

ST. LUKE'S HOSPITAL AFFAIRS.
Increase in the Number of Patients
Necessitates Additional Buildings.
At a meeting of the board of directors
of St. Luke's Hospital last night the res
ignation of President Dr. J. V. D. Mid
dletoh was received from New York. Dr.
Mlddleton stated as his reason for resign
ing the presidency of the corporation that
he was going to Europe on a lengthy tour.
The resignation was accepted and the di
rectors elected C. V. S. Gibbs, the former
president of the board, to the vacant
chair. President Gibbs has been identi
fied with the directory of St. Luke's Hos
pital for a number of years and has dur
ing this period spent more time and given
more financial aid to it than any other
one man connected with the corporation.
The question of extending Twenty-sev
enth street through the northern side of
the grounds as advocated by an improve
ment club in that portion of the Mission
was discussed in an informal sort of way.
Sufficient, however, of the feeling of the
directors was elicited to learn that the
scheme will be resisted by the stockhold
ers of St. Luke's Hospital. As to the pro
gressive spirit of the directors in aiding
improvements in that portion of the Mis
sion they will join hands with the pro
gressionists in opening Duncan street on
the southwest side of the hospital lot
and will cheerfully contribute one-half
oi" the expense attending the grading,
sewering and paving of the same, putting
it in that condition which will authorize
its acceptance by the city.
The question of providing more room
for patients was discussed by the mem
bers of the board. It was stated that the
hospital was now overcrowded and appli
cants had to be refused accommodation
in consequence.
To provide for more ward accommoda
tion C. V. S. Gibbs, Dr. George H. Pow
ers and Judge F. W. Van Reynegom were
appointed a committee to procure an ad
ditional building, the expense of which is
not to exceed $10,000. This limit, the di
rectors explained, was because it is the
intention to erect an entire new building
in the near future which will be an up
to-date affair, possessing all the very lat
est improvements known to medical sci-
ence. â¢ ' â 
The present building was erected nearly
thirty years ago and at the time It was
put up the site was on an island, in the
middle of the Mission Creek. Access to
it was over a wooden bridge from Twen
ty-sixth street. Ever since its construc
tion it has been a very popular place for
patients and has had the name of being
well managed.
SHE KNEW OF THE WILL.
Interesting Testimony in the Suit of
Carrie Sankey Against the
Cogginses.
The action of Miss Carrie Sankey
against her ex-guardians, Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Coggins, to recover property
valued at about $30,000, is drawing to a
close before Judge Belcher. The rebuttal
opened when the case was called yester
day morning, and some interesting facts
were elicited. Mrs. Coggins, in her testi
mony given on direct examination, said
that she did not know Miss Sankey had
made a will in her favor. This testimony
was refuted by Miss Bachus and Mrs.
Katie A. Carter, both of these witnesses
positively testifying that on several occa
sions Mrs. Coggins had conversed with
them regarding this matter. Miss Sankey
was recalled for examination, and testi
fied that when she signed a release of all
demands against her ex-guardians she
was in a state of health bordering on col
lapse and did not know what she was do
ing. This testimony was the subject of
numerous objections, but it all got In and
will doubtless materially affect the de
termination of the case.

GAGE CLOSETED IN A
PATRONAGE CONFERENCE
Plans to Strengthen the Republican
Party Discussed.
The Governor, Wendell Easton, D. M. Burns
and Major McLaughlin Together Three
Hours at the Palace.
GOVERNOR GAGE, Wendell Eas
ton, D. M. Burns and Frank
McLaughlin were in conference
at a room in the Palace Hotel
from 2 o'clock until nearly 5
yesterday afternoon. E. F. Preston
was expected but did not attend. The
attendants after waiting nearly an
hour for Mr. Preston began to discuss
the subject which the conference was
called to consider.
Governor Gage, having determined to
make a good many appointments to of
fice when he reaches Sacramento the
latter part of this week, expressed a
desire to confer with certain Repub
licans who were active in the campaign
last fall before announcing his selec
tions. In bringing the topic to the at
tention of the conference yesterday he
spoke of his former declaration that he
intended to recognize, in the distribu
tion of the patronage at the bestowal
of the executive, the interests which
largely contributed to the success of
the party last November. He indicated
that he had not changed his mind and
would endeavor to recognize the lead
ing elements of the party in the dis
tribution of official patronage.
The Governor is reported as having
said that he would be guided by a de
sire to unite the conflicting elements in
the party and so strengthen the party
organization for the next campaign. He
disclaimed any intention to reward in
dividuals for personal favors. He
asked the men present to speak with
out resorvation. concerning the merit
and fitness of applicants for the vari
ous positions.
The story goes that some plain talk
followed and more than a little feeling
was exhibited when the talk became
decidedly pointed. Surprise was mani
fested over the declaration that the
Governor intended to recognize the
wishes of certain leading Republicans,
but there was no open remonstrance.
One of the attendants had. no hesita
tion in saying that the future success
of the party depended upon a recog
nition of all the leaders who had con
tributed to the success of the Repub
lican party in the election last Novem
ber.
When . the names of applicants for
office, together with the names of their
respective indorsers, were read the in
terest in the proceedings became ani
mated. The Governor invited unre
A MORAL WAVE
HITS EMERYVILLE
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call, 90S Broadway, May 3.
EMERYVILLE is becoming moral.
The keno-players will have to move on. After being driven out of
Oakland by Councilman Girard's ordinance they took refuge in Emery
ville, and for a week several express wagons have been busy carting
gambling paraphernalia out to Emeryville. A section of the San Pablo road
north of Thirty-seventh street is in Emeryville and instantly became a favor
ite place for gamblers.
If there be any money in Emeryville to spare for gambling it is all
wanted at the racetrack, so it was not surprising that the Emeryville Trus
tees should decide that keno is an unwelcome, immoral innovation in their
little town, and take steps to prohibt it. Last night an ordinance was in
troduced making it illegal to deal, play, carry on, either as owner or em
ploye, any game of keno, or to play or bet in any such game within the town
of Emeryville. It is also made a misdemeanor to rent any place in which
keno shall be played. The fine for violating any provision of the ordinance
is fixed at $300, or three months' imprisonment, or both.
There is no doubt that the ordinance will be finally passed. It is worthy
of remark that this moral measure was introduced by W. Fieldwick, man
ager of the racetrack and a Trustee of the town of Emeryville.

served comment or criticism and at
least one member of the conference ac
cepted the suggestion and spoke his
mind freely as he had no favors to ask,
no friends to reward and no enemies to
punish. He professed to speak for what
he believed to be the good of the service
and the party welfare.
As far as can be ascertained no agree
ment was reached yesterday in favor of
any applicant. In some instances the
members of the conference were not
wide apart in their views, but the Gov
ernor did not signify that his choice
was fixed. In two or three cases ob
jection to leading aspirants for political
favor was so pronounced that a "turn
down" was regarded as inevitable. It
was whispered last night that Jacob
Steppacher would not be nominated
Registrar of Voters.
It was the sense of the conference
that it would be wise for the Governor
to recognize the labor organizations in
the appointment of the Commissioner
of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but
the fact was stated that the organiza
tions had presented but one name.
There was no enthusiasm for the one
recommended.
The Governor advised the conference
that he had appointed Major Ben
C. Truman to represent the region of
Southern California at the Paris Expo
sition. Many names were canvassed
for the other two places â to repre
sent the central and the other the
northern part of the State. An effort
is being made to induce the Governor
to appoint the Democratic commis
sioner from the central part of the
State, and E. B. Pond has been sug
gested as a proper man for the place.
Drury Melone is said to be doing some
missionary work in Pond's behalf. The
idea is advanced that one of the com
missioners at least should be a rich
man, so that he could afford to spend
money lavishly at the exposition.
The slate fixed up at Sacramento
some weeks ago contained the names
of Ben Truman, Mark L. McDonald and
M. H. de Young for the Paris Exposi
tion Commission. The declination of
De Young affords opportunity for the
revision of the general plan so as to
take a Democrat from San Francisco
and put in a Republican from the
northern part of the State instead of
McDonald. The Governor is said to be
casting about for an acceptable Repub
lican in Sacramento. Herrin is said to
have a friend in Shasta County who
would be glad to get the job. After the
conference dissolved the Governor was
asked if anything had been done with
reference to Mark McDonald's case,
and he replied that no action was taken
thereon.

Schell has made a report to Chief North
of the case of Clara Sture, alias Clara
Stewart, an 18-year-old girl, who arrived
from England in July, IS9S. The girl had
been subject to epileptic fits before her
arrival here, and Immediately after her
arrival was sent to the City and County
Hospital to be treated for the fits and a
loathsome disease. The girl was then
placed in the California Girls' Training
School, and was afterward committed to
the Stockton Insane Asylum. Her sister.
Mrs. Minnie Sture of Mississippi street in
this city, informed Captain Schell that
she was unable to provide for the unfor
tunate girl and that she had no other
relatives here. Captain Schell urges that
Clara be sent back to England.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROME, May The Italian Ministry
has resigned as a special sequel to the
scene in the Chamber of Deputies yes
terday.
In the course of a prolonged and ani
mated discussion regarding the Govern
ment's foreign policy the Minister for
Foreign Affairs, Admiral Canavaro. cre
ated a lively sensation by producing,
in response to the attacks upon his pol
icy at San Mun Bay, an official letter
signed by Count Benin Longare, Under
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
in the Cabinet of Marquis di Rudini.
and addressed to the then Minister of
Marine, Signor Brin, requesting him to
initiate some action that would secure
for Italy a station in China. This let
ter showed that the present leaders of
the opposition . initiated the policy
which they are criticizing. Admiral
Canavaro's action in making public a
secret document evoked sharp comment
from Marquis di Rudini, Signor Crispi
and other leading members of the
Chamber of Deputies. Signor Crispi, in,
the course of his protest, said:
"We are giving, with light hearts, a !
sorry spectacle to Europe. I ask the
Chamber to* cease his discussion." As
he closed Signor â¢ .rispi was greeted
with an extraordinary demonstration,
several members rising and exclaiming,
"He is our only man."
Immediately upon the opening of the j
Chamber of Deputies to-day General
Pellieux, the Premier and Minister of
the Interior, arose and addressed an
attentive house. He said that in con
sequence of the interpellations touch
ing the Chinese question the Govern
ment had considered the gravity of the
situation. The effect of yesterday's
debate showed a la.. minority in the
Chamber of Deputies against the Min
istry's action in China, which would be
supported by only a weak majority.
Therefore, the Prime Minister said,
there could be no useful result from
further discussion.
General Pellieux said he wondered I
how a modest commercial initiative in I
China could justify fears of military ;
expansion in Erythrea. The Govern
ment, he said, could not consent to
withdraw Italian warships from the
Yellow Sea, and then I resigned.
The Prime Minister's statement was
greeted by loud murmurs from the
Leftists. General Pellieux concluded
by announcing the resignation of the
Cabinet.
The adjournment of the house having
been moved a number of Deputies pro
tested loudly against the habit of Min
isters resigning on the eve of an ad
verse vote. Finally in the midst of
considerable uproar the Chamber ad
journed amid great excitement.
King Humbert has reserved his de
cision relative to the resignation of the
Ministry, but the Cabinet will remain
in office for the dispatch of current
business.
It is understood that the occupation
of San Mun Bay, China, will take place
immediately, thus making it un fait ac
compli for the incoming Premier.
Late to-night a report is in circula
tion that General Pellieux has already
received an informal mandate to recon
struct the Ministry.
BROKE THE BRIC-A-BRAC
AND REFUSED TO ?[ V
Colonel Ingersoll the Defendant in a
Suit Brought by His Former
Landlord.
NEW YORK, May 3. Colonel Robert
G. Ingersoll was defendant In a suit yes
terday before Justice Martin, the plain
tiff being Dr. Ellas M. 1.. Bristol, who
wanted to recover $133 50. The doctor
says the colonel, who had leased his Mad
ison avenue residence, damaged furniture
and bric-a-brac to that amount and de
clined to pay for it. Artists, tradesmen,
experts, lawyers and principals were In
court, and a cracked bust of Charles
Dickens was placed beside a patched-up
Japanese vase on a table before the Jus
tice's bench.
Colonel Ingersoll occupied Dr. Bristol's
furnished house at an annual rental of
$6503 until last fall, when the rent being
raised to 17500 the colonel moved to Gram
ercy Park. It was in moving that the
bust of Dickens was knocked over and
cracked and the tall vase had its top
shattered. Hence the litigation. When
Colonel Ingersoll was asked in court if
he would swear when called to give his
testimony, he smiled and said, "What's
the use of troubling the Almighty about
such a little case as this?"
Colonel Ingersoll affirmed that he had
been ready to pay a reasonable price for
the broken articles.
"I sent $20 In gold to Dr. Bristol's at
torn, he said. "sls for th. statuette
and $5 for the vase. The broken furniture
bill was an aft. rthoughl on the doctor's
part. I was told of it weeks later. At
first there was no claim except for the
vase and the statuette."
Justice Martin reserved his decision

ARMED MEN FOR
MINERS' PLACES
Plan of Arkansas Coal
Operators.
â â¦ â
Special Dispatch to Tlie Call.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., May 3.âGov
ernor Jones has been Informed of a
move to bring into the coal mine dis
trict an armed body of men to take the
places of the strikers. He has given in
structions to the State authorities to
summon every able-bodied man in Se
bastian County, if necessary, to enforce
the injunction of Judge Rowe. All such
armed men are to be met at the State
line and placed under arrest, as are
also those who supply the arms.
Mine operators will be arrested by
the State authorities when they at
tempt to bring in armed laborers un
der the protection of Deputy Marshals.
The injunctions issued by the State
and Federal courts are in direct con
flict, and the Governor regards the sit
uation as critical. He is determined
that the writ of the State court shall
be carried out, and if necessary will
go to the mining district in person and
direct the carrying out of the court's
order, which he believes to be the only
way in which bloodshed can be averted.
The strikers are armed and a san
guinary conflict is said to be inevitable
if non-union men are imported.

Nickel Machines Must Go.
LOS ANGELES, May Mayor Fred
Eaton called a special meeting of the Po
lice Commission to-day to take action in
removing nickel -ln-the-slot machines
from saloons. He presented a lengthy
communication in which he suggested
that a license be placed upon them so
heavy as to be prohibitive. This feature
the Mayor embodied in a series of reso
lutions that he had prepared, and he de
manded that the Council take cognizance
of the growing evil. As the commission
is empowered by ordinance to revoke the
licenses of saloons that maintain nickel,
machines,, it is expected the board will
act Independently if the Council fall at
its next meeting to take the matter up.

OTIS WILL LOCK
HORNS WITH GAGE
The General Denounces
Dan Burns.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 3.â lt is quite
evident from an interview with Briga
dier General Harrison Gray Otis to-day
that while he disavows any quarrel
with Governor Gage, and while he as
serts he is seeking none and expresses
surprise that there should even be a
hint that there is any feeling of un
pleasantness between them, he will not
run away from a fight that may fol
low his intended crusade against Dan
Burns. Otis opposed some of the meth
ods adopted by Nominee Gage, and it
is said by those who are fully aware
of the facts that if Governor Gage has
any Intention of carrying these earlier
matters through his tenure of office the
('tis pen will speedily disclose the at
titude to be expected.
As Otis does not disguise the fact that
he will oppose Burns at all stages Of
the Mexican's political ambitions, it is
apparent upon the first day of the Gen
eral's arrival that the only terms of
peace between Otis and Gage must be
the elimination of Dan Burns as a fac
tor in the situation. Owing to the
friendship of Governor Gage for Burns
the presumption Is warranted that this
concession will not be probable, and
that Otis will soon be "in the game."
General Otis is not prepared to make
peace overtures to Governor Henry T.
Gage; neither does he expect any large
sized olive branches bearing the com
pliments of the California executive will
be left at his door. 'â '..'â¢.'â¢ ;.â¢';.
"If Daniel M. Burns has been ap
pointed United States Senator," said
Otis, "I must deplore that fact as an
humble citizen of the State of Califor
nia, and I certainly hope that Colonel
Burns will not two years hence be
elected to that position."
"Do you approve of the course of the
Times in supporting U. S. Grant?" was
asked. â¢ i
"I say 'yes* to that question, most
emphatically. While there are other
men in the State more qualified for the
position none are more worthy. At the
particular time there was no other al
ternative than for every good citizen
to Ret in behind U. S. Grant.
"The statement made while I was in
the Philippines that I had cabled an
agreement to support Grant in return
for his relinquishing the seat to me at
a stated period was never suggested
in any form." continued Otis, "as I was
not then and am not now a candidate."
The statements reported to have been
made by Governor Gage wherein the
Governor threw down a deft to General
Otis have angered the general, who In
tends to write to Gage in a few days,
asking him if he was correctly quoted. â¢

CLOSING IN ON
FOES OF DREYFUS
General Staff in a Sad
Plight.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS. May 3.â Slowly but steadily the
net Is closing around the French general
staff in the Dreyfus revision inquiry.
General Marcler, who was Minister of
War at the time Dreyfus was condemned,
on being called upon by M. de Freyclnet,
the present Minister of War, to produce
the* report regarding the secret dossier,
which Lieutenant Colonel Paty dv
Clam testified he had sent to Mercier, re
plied that he had destroyed It, and he
called General Gonz as a witness to the
truth of the statement. Unfortunately for
Mercier, General Gonz had already testi
fied before the Court of Cassation that
although Mercier had destroyed the orig
inal, he kept a copy.
Another anti-Dreyfus argument has re
ceived Its death blow. General Zurlinden,
Military Governor at Paris, and others,
While testifying before the Court of Cas
sation, attached great importance to the
closing sentence of the bordereau, "I am
starting for the maneuvers," as proving
the guilt of Dreyfus and the innocence of
Esterhazy, Inasmuch as the staff proba
tioners were only notified on August 29
that they would not be required to attend
the maneuvers.
It has now been proved that this notifi
cation was actually dated May 17. There
fore Dreyfus could not have written "I
am starting for the maneuvers" in the
following August.
It Is rumored that it was lieutenant
Colonel Paty dv Clam himself who com
municated to the Figaro the depositions
made before the Court of Cassation

THE WEEKLY CALLT
I $1 per Year.ALL THE BOW-WOWS OF
HIGH DEGREE WERE THERE
The Dog Show Opens and
Gives Promise of Being
a Great Success in Every
Respect.
Sidelights ar) d
Incidents of
the Bench.
THE third annual dog show of the
San Francisco Kennel Club is now in
full blast at Mechanics' Pavilion.
Considering that yesterday was the
first day of the exhibition the crowd pres
ent to see the big and little bowwows
was large, compos.- principally of the.
class of people who take an interest ln
the welfare of "man's best friend."
The benching of dogs is an rove
ment on shows of the past, as it is lower
than formerly and gives spectators a bet
ter opportunity of seeing the dogs In their
highly polished coats of rough and
â¢smooth hair.
Th- numbering on the respective ken
nels is decidedly poor, but this defect will
doubtless be attended to to-day so that
the readers of catalogues hy a reference
to the book can learn the owners -of the
dogs benched.
The fox terriers are a first-class lot. es
pecially those that belong to the kennels
of J. R Martin and D. Shannon of this
city and Rev. J. \V. Finton of Victoria.
B. C. The deerhounds are not an improve
ment on the past. The foxhounds are of
about the same quality exhibited at the
la_-t show. The Irish water spaniels are
of hieh class, hut they ar* f*w in num
ber. The Irish terriers show a slight im
provement on the past. The greyhounds
are very few compared to the display of
lor.gtails that have been exhihited in past
years. Those on the bench are. however.
of high standard. Dogs like Systematic.
Victor King and Rock Island Boy are
prod enough to mingle in the hest of com
pany.
The reason assigned for the poor splay
of greyhounds this year is the favoritism
displayed hy Judge Bell who. for some
reason hest known to himself, awarded
winning colors at the last show held in
this city to dogs owned . v a certain in
dividual who. in the language of a popu
lar leashman. were said to have "strings
on the judge."
The mastiffs are not a very good lot,
although a slight improvement ln the
stock is noticeable.
The Newfoundlands are not up to the
standard of excellence expected.
The Great Danes are not of high class.
although there are a few good ones
ami r.e the gathering.
The St. Bernards are worth going a dis
tance to see. Th* class of does on exhi
bition is excellent and reflects much
creu.t on the St. Bernard Club of this
city.
Th* setters and pointers are also of a
high class and present a very fin* ap
pearance. Among the dogs that are i
prized hy the sportsman are several well- j
known bench show winn*rs.
Although there is a good display of
collies, it cannot b* said that there is a
noticeable improvement in the stock.
The hull terriers are very well repre- .
sented ar.d arrfong the fighters there are
several good ones. The Boston terriers
â¢;o not show a marked improvement on !
th* past.
The cocker spaniels show up very well
on this occasion: they can compare fa
â  â -â -â .;.* with those exhibited at Eastern !
'"nampion Havoc and Champion ;
Viscount ar* of very hieh class and will !
ibtless catch th* eye of Judge Laoey.
Among the cookers is the little bitch I
Florita. the property of â¢-â  A. Sweeney of
s nta Cruz, that is very much mired
by the fancy. Florita. although housed
by herself and away from th* big ken
nels of cockers, will doubtless be heard
from when she makes her appearance
in the ring. Mrs. W. a. Deane has "a
cinch" on the Itaiian greyhound exhibits,
as she is th* only lady represented with
this breed of dogs at "the show. The la
dies' p*ts ar* num*rous and command al
most the exclusive attention of the fair
ones.
The manaKement of the show, consid
ering that yesterday was the Inaugu
ral day. was very eood and doubtless
th* San Francisco" TOnn^l Clnb will re
ceive the thanks of the exhibitors when
the exhibition will have ended.

own way at the dog show. There are the
flowers, the bright-hued ribbon bows, the
decorated "cages." the satin-lined bas
kets, the young maids, the old maids, the
imported judge and Llnvllleâ the Billy
Jordan of the kennel clubs.
Linvllle outside the dog arena is a plain,
every-day Kearny-sti special. At the
show he comes before the canines. His
padded shoulders square and massive as
the case of a baby grand piano, his high
cap (specially manufactured for the occa
sion.. his summer girl shirt and his ruby j
ring make him the observed of all observ- j
ers.
"Say. mister." queried a delicate patri
cian youngster yesterday, "aren't you the j
Judge of all the show?" Condescendingly
the ulcer looked down from his great
height, patronizingly smiled at the admir
ing circle of femininity clustered around
him and thus made answer:
"No, sonny; I ain't. But if the manage
ment of this here show had known their
j businessâ l have been the chief attraction
of dog- shows for the past thirty years.
There, there, clear the way: that lady
| over there wants to consult me about her
poodle."
The dog show has divided the sexes.
Apparently there has been no educa
tion in dogology. Woman at the show
, naturally drifts toward the diminutive
animals, the "freak end", while man
sticks to the real, life-size dog.
The "freaks" are in cages lined with
. tufted satin, decorated with choice blos
soms and wearing brilliant-hued ribbon
I harness. Round the "freak end" the air
i is thick with the love language specially
coined for doting womankind for the wee
] things she pets and loves. Every doggie

has its "mamma" who loves it and will
take care of it and see that her little
petsie-wetsie gets the prixey-wlzey she â 
deserves.
The "dearest thing" at the show Is the j
dog that calls Miss Mason "mamma."
The proud "parent" of doggie stands be- j
side her cage and gives pointers to the
admiring women who admire the sleek â 
little brown body and the bright, intelli
gent eves. Every compliment paid to
doggie is fondly cherished by her mis- !
tress who tempers all outside praise with \
a "bless her heart.'
There was not much "fashion" yester
day at j the show. Society has tared j
against "openings" from a strictly fash
ionable standpoint, and the closing night
now claims exclusively the attention of
the swells. - , , '
Those who did attend the show yester
day forgot all about class distinction, took ;
off their gloves, patted all the animals,
carefully examined their catalogues, dis- I
cussed dog biscuits and now and then
rubbed noses with a "sweet thing" behind \
flower-decked frail bars. _â¢â¢â â¢. â¢-;->â¢->
Lacev, the noted judge, especially im- I

Similar Action to Be Taken Against

t Notorious Card
Joints.
The Police Commissioners last night
aimed an effective blow at the gambling
joints south of Market street by refusing
to renew the license of the Metropole sa
loon.
The condemned saloon is at 773 Market
street, and unless the proprietor obtains
the signatures of twelve property-owner-*
in the Immediate vicinity the action of
the Commissioners will be final.
Immediately on being notified of the
action of the police board the proprietor
extinguished the lights in the saloon and
closed the place.
The Metropole is one of the notorious
joints which were raided by the police.
Percentage poker games were carried on
in open violation of the law. and even
continued after Captain Spillane and his
men had raided the place. Determined
to suppress the games. Captain Spillane
found it necessary to station one of his
officers in the saloon, with instructions
not to allow a card to be turned. The
proprietor, a man named Hansen, evi
dently realizing that the police meant
business, sold out his interest in the sa
loon. The license expired last Tuesday,
and when the new proprietor appeared
before the Police Commissioners last
evening for a renewal of the license his
request was promptly denied. Similar ac
tion will be taken when the proprietors
of the Cafe Royal. "Our House" and
other gambling joints ask for a renewal
of their licenses.
"Gambling must stop." remarked Judge
Tobin, the president of the board, after
the meeting. "Our refusal to grant a re
newal of the license issued to the Metro
pole will be followed by similar refusals.
By this means we hope to effectually stop
unlawful gambling in this city."
The Commissioners also adopted the
following resolution, a copy of which will
be transmitted to the Board of Supervis
ors to-day:
Whereas, saloons are at present in too close
proximity to the Presidio reservation and thus
detrimental to the best interest and discipline
of the soldiers stationed at such reseratlon,
causing riots and destruction of property, now,
therefore, be It
Resolved. That the honorable Board of Su
pervisors be and are hereby petitioned to
adopt a resolution prohibiting the issuance of
liquor license? to any saloon situate.) any
where within two blocks of the easterly line _f
said reservation, and be it further
Resolved, That the clerk of this beard be
and is hereby Instructed to forward to said
Board of Supervisors a copy of this resolu
tion.
The resolution Is intended to prevent a
repetition of the outrage which was com
mitted by drunken soldiers several weeks
ago. In their drunken fury they attacked
a saloon contiguous to the Presidio and
after wrecking the place set fire to it, en
dangering the lives an' property of the
people adjoining.
The board appointed Frank Norman,
the popular clerk in the office of the Chief
of Police, to the office of corporal, made
vacant by the retirement of John Heaney.
The appointment of a successor to former
Lieutenant Price, who was disrated at a
recent meeting, was deferred for one
week. .
Little Egypt in More Trouble.
"Little Egypt," who was recently fined
$100 by Judge Mo-ran for giving an inde
cent performance at the Midway Plai
sance on Market street, has enlisted the
services of the police in assisting her in
procuring her trunk, which she claims is
being held by Ed Homan. the proprietor
of the place. Shortly after her conviction
the woman was released on an appeal
bond, which was furnished by Homan.
He fears that she Is about to leave the
city, and to indemnify himself against
any loss he has taken possession of her
trunk. To-day she Intends to get out a
search warrant for the recovery of the
trunk.

The Pacific Unitarian Conference, now
in session at the First Unitarian Church,
has drawn a large attendance from all i
over the State.
To-day's proceedings were opened by :
Rev. N. A. Haskell, who treated of I
Christ as a social rather than a religious
leader. Judge Works of Los Angeles was
then elected chairman, in place of Hon.
Horace Davis, who was unable to be !
present.
The reports of the various committees
were read, and showed that L'nitarianism
is making great progress on this coast. !
Committees were appointed as follows: j
Businessâ Rev. J. T. Sunderland. Rev. C.
J. K. Jones of Los Angeles. Rev. X. A.
Haskell. Charles A. Murdock, Rev. George !
R. Dodson and Sheldon Kellogg. Resolu

was particularly generous to the Pacific
Coast. sending $-â¢â¢""" out here to help the
church and receiving but $500 in return.
Mr. Brooke declared that at this time
Unitarianism is endangered by the fact j
that there is a rising tide of clericalism
sweeping toward the East, which must be
resisted and the free church upheld.
A letter from Rev. Dr. Wendte was
read stating that his health is much im
proved and the conference passed a reso
lution ordering its congratulations to be
sent to the First Church's pastor.
The condition and needs of the church
on the coast were discussed by Rev. A. J.
Wells of San. Francisco.
This evening "Our Gospel was the sub
ject, and it was handled by Chaplain
Frederic C. Brown. U. S. N.; Rabbi Jacob

AN INADEQUATE QUARANTINE.
rROM the appearance of a case of smallpox at
the Presidio among the soldiers recently j
brought from Manila by the transport Sher
man, it is evident the quarantine inspection was not
adequate to the needs of the emergency. The disease
has been permitted to find its way into the city in
this one case certainly, and it will be due to good
fortune rather than to good management it further
outbreaks of the malady do not occur.
The record hows that one of the passengers on the
transport died from smallpox about fourteen days
before she arrived at tins port. No other case of the
disease was manifest during the voyage, and after de
taining the ship in quarantine for two days after her
arrival the quarantine officials concluded the danger
was passed and permitted her crew and passengers to
come ashore. This action was based upon the belief
of the quarantine physicians that smallpox germs
do not develop after sixteen day*, and that if any :
such germs should survive that period they would
be destroyed by the fumigation practiced at the sta
tion.
The case at the Presidio effectively disproves such,
assumptions. The disease germ lurked with unabated
force, but without showing itself, during the whole
period of sixteen days, and was not destroyed by
fumigation. It has now begun its virulent work on
shore, and vigilance will be required to prevent it
from spreading further.
It is clear there is needed at the quarantine station
a more drastic process of dealing with such diseases.
It would not be too much to hold a ship at the sta
tion until fully twenty days had passed since a death
by smallpox among her crew. Moreover, the purifi
cation of the ship and of her crew must be attended
to with greater care. One evidence of the inadequacy
of the service has been given. We should not have
another.
THE IMPORTANCE OF FLAX.
OUR recent reference to the experiments made
at Walla Walla penitentiary in the manufac
ture of grain bags from flax tow, raised in
California, has roused considerable interest among
farmers and manufacturers. It is developed that im
proved machinery for conversion of the fiber into
tow awaits an opportunity for trial, and that the
double crop of seed and fiber is possible. We import
largely of Calcutta linseed oil for use on this coast, and
there seems no good reason why we should not pro
duce it all here. The tariff on linseed oil is 20 cents
a gallon, raw or boiled; on flax tow it is $20 a ton,
and on flaxseed 25 cents per bushel of fifty-six
pounds.
The success in using our flax tow with the jute
machinery of Washington penitentiary would indicate
that it is time for our farmers to take advantage of
the protection given by the Dingley bill to the flax
industry. The bottom lands of the Sacramento,
Feather and Yuba rivers no doubt offer as good ad
vantages as can be found anywhere for growing flax,
and the same may be found in the San Joaquin Val
ley. It is a good crop for rotation, and where the
production of seed is sufficient to warrant the use of
the oil mill the use of the oil cake in feeding stock
returns the elements of fertility to the soil. In Tulare
County increasing attention is being paid to dairy
ranching, and there is much land there adapted to
flax. The linseed oil cake would find a ready mar
ket as part of a dairy ration.
During the spring many Farmers' Institutes will
be held all over the State, and those who attend them
should secure some information from experts on the
cultivation and preparation of flax. This crop was
produced by the pioneers in the States of the Upper
Mississippi Valley, where it was retted and the fiber
prepared and woven into a coarse but very durable
tow for garments. As the domestic loom was re
tired from service flax came to be raised for the
seed alone and was found profitable.
We have no statistics of the production per acre of
seed and tow, but they are attainable and should be
studied. The first point for experiment is with the
jute machinery in San Quentin.
Two industries are quite peculiar to California and
are related to our permanent resources. These are
the manufacture of grain bags and that of fruit boxes.
Anything that affects them is of vast and enduring
interest. It is supposed that the annual consumption
of bags is about sixty millions.
If the raw jute import prove an annoying Compe
tition the tariff can be at any time amended to ex
clude it. It is only necessary to demonstrate that this
State can produce the raw material for all the bags
used, and there will be no lack of protection.
As we have intimated, this most primitive use of
flax tow may lead to the discovery of localities where
its more refined uses for linen fabrics can be carried
on. Its extra quality for that purpose having been al
ready demonstrated in Belgium, when a crop is pro
duced experiment will go on here.
This State has spent some public money and offi
cial effort upon the production of silk, and we have
produced it to discover that the industry is not fitted"
to our labor system. The opposite is the case with
flax. Now all that is required is that the Prison
Directors pay some official attention to the matter
and secure the tow required for experiment on the
jute machinery.
THE RUSSIONIZATION OF FINLAND.
THE CALL has already referred to this subject,
to which throughout Europe the deepest inter
est has been attached. The preparations for the
International Peace Conference at The Hague and
the extirpation of Finnish autonomy and of Finnish
liberty proceed side by side. The Czar, who initiated
the conference and who uttered the pithy expression,
"Power must honor right," needs no transformation
of identity to reveal the duality of his nature. He
simultaneously enacts the characters of Dr. Jekyll and
of Mr. Hyde.
Finland is an ancient country, possessed of an ad
vanced civilization and pervaded by deeply religious
sentiment. As early as 1157 she was attached to
Sweden, but was substantially governed by her own
laws. Allusion has been already made in these
columns to the solemn oath taken by Alexander I, in
1809, when she was annexed to Russia, in which he
promised to "confirm and establish the religion and
the fundamental laws of the country and the privi
leges and rights of every class," embracing the Lu
theran clergy, the burgesses and the peasantry, and
"to maintain all these privileges and laws firm and
unbroken in their full force." This oath was renewed
by each of his successors, and by the present Czar at
the deathbed of his father. It was further confirmed
by positive statutes or governmental rules, in which,
by section 40, it was provided that "the ruler may not
create new laws or abolish any old law without the
consent of the Diet," and by section 71 that "unani
mous consent" was required. Section 83 enacted
that the fundamental law or the constitution of Fin
land should "remain unchangeable," except through
the same parliamentary unanimity. On April 3, 1869,
by Alexander II these rules were declared to be ir
revocable.
It is these sacred and repeated guarantees that, by
his imperial manifesto of February 15, 1800, the pres
ent Czar has wantonly repudiated. As far back as
July of last year he had exacted a new and oppressive
army bill from an extra session of the Diet. He has
now placed the Diet itself, which consists of four
chambers, under the control of the Russian Council
of State. He refused to receive the highest officers
of the Finnish local government, sent to plead for the
life of Finnish institutions. One of the most pathetic
memorials ever framed, signed by 527,009 Finns and
taken to St. Petersburg by 500 deputies, representing
all the electoral wards of Finland, he declined to hear
and answered by abruptly directing the deputies to
return to their native country. He turned a deaf
ear to such touching words as these, offered with an
admirable mixture of deference and firmness: "And
the right of a weak people is as holy as that of the
greatest nation â its love of country is before Al
mighty God a grace from which it never should turn."
In order to prove the extremity of his determination
he has destroyed journalistic liberty and inaugurated
a plan of exiling the Finns who even passively re
sist his tyrannical edict. Every article published in
the local press must be sanctioned by an official
censor, and the newspapers received from Finland
are mottled with blank spaces, the proofs of the
exercise of this arbitrary authority. In Helsingfors
lately an editor devised the expedient of printing
literal texts from the Scriptures on the accountability
of rulers, which he sent by a boy for the inspection
of the censor. "Who composed them?" inquired the
censor. "God," answered the awe-stricken messen
ger. "Off, you rascal tell them this is shameful,"
was the close of the brief dialogue. Christian people
all over the globe will observe with indignation the
power of a petty autocrat to suppress the publication
and the possible transmission to his imperial master
of sentences impressed under both the Lutheran and
the Greek creeds with the authority of the King of
kings and Lord of lords:
"If a man * * * swear an oath to bind his soul
with a bond he shall not break his word."
"He that ruleth over men must be just."
"It is an abomination to kings to commit wicked
ness, for the throne is established by righteousness."
The partition of Poland left an ineffaceable stain
upon the three powers that divided its territory. The
wholesale destruction of the constitutional govern
ment of the God-fearing and civilized Finns, habitu
ated for centuries to the exercise of some at least of
the inalienable rights of freemen, and the obliteration
of their nationality, is an equally heart-rending
tragedy. Their patriotism is deeply impressive.
Their developed resources, their industry, their fru
gality, their artistic perceptions, are worthy of uni
versal respect. Their principal city, Helsingfors,
founded in 1550 and in 1819 made their capital, is
architecturally beautiful and filled with educated and
refined inhabitants. Their university, established in
1640 and subsequently removed to Helsingfors, is a
splendid pile of buildings, where both sexes find the
higher education accessible, under a faculty that re
ceives the general recognition of scholastic Europe.
Their history is pervaded by romance, as their lake
studded land, with its old castles and its medieval
relics, preserved in the midst of modern development,
shines under the northern sun like a succession of
gems. Their national epic, the Kalevala, is one of
the valued possessions of literature. To the Finnish
people Alexander 11, who was true to all his pledges,
is a heroic memory, and around the base of his mag
nificent statue they gather in thousands, in the deep
est mourning, and scatter beautiful flowers,- while
they sing their national songs, including "Our Land,"
composed by their great poet, Johan Ludvig Rune
berg, which is considered by many critics to be
among the finest of the melodious tributes to pa
triotism.
The Russianization of Finland is a harrowing spec
tacle that appeals to the heart of Christendom. The
educated classes in Russia witness this rapid destruc
tion of a nation with silent displeasure. Leo Tolstoi
boldly applauds the tenacity with which the Finns
cling to their "rightful interests." In Great Britain
a committee, mainly composed of members of Par
liament, is acting vigorously, large protesting meet
ings have been held, in which Liberals and Conserva
tives have united in their denunciations, and a news
paper called the Finland has been established to aid
in subjecting the Czar to the pressure of that public
opinion which is the voice of the civilized world.
There are between three and four thousand Finns
in California, and many thousands in other parts of
the United States. If we can spare time from the
work of annexing the Philippines and remember how
the eloquence of Webster and other great Americans
aided the emancipation of Greece and self-govern
ment in Ireland, some public manifestation of sym
pathy with the Finnish martyrdom would be a re
freshing interlude in the drama of American im
perialism. The Finns are far closer to our race than
the Tagals and Vizcayans.
If any further argument were needed against the
expediency of permitting Governors to appoint Sen
ators when Legislatures fail to elect it would be found
in the fact that it is now proposed by the executives
of California and Pennsylvania to appoint such men
as Matthew Quay and Dan Burns.
â¦ .
It looks as if it would be advisable to put the quar
antine itself into quarantine for a while and see if it
.could not be made to attend to business better.
THE SA.N FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AY 4, 1899.
TRfIDE COMBINATIONS.
CLOSELY following the movement started in
San Jose to form a combination of prune
growers along lines similar to those which have
led the raisin-growers of Fresno to prosperity comes
the undertaking of an enterprise to form an association
of California fruit-packers. for the promotion of that
industry. It will be seen, therefore, that it is not in
the East alone the advantages of such combinations
are appreciated. California has learned the lesson
and has profited by.it.
All recent experience proves that in a considerable
number of industries something is gained in economy
by every enlargement of the unit of control. Three
or four small railways that are unprofitable when
operated separately become a valuable property when
converted into a trunk line and placed under a sin
gle management Small mills and factories that have
ceased to be paying investments are made profitable
when combined in a single corporation and operated
on that basis.
This experience has taught the industrial and com
mercial world the expediency of forming large com
binations wherever possible, and, accordingly, in all
the progressive nations of the earth such combina
tions are now common. It seems to be destined by
the working of an unavoidable law of economic de
velopment that certain industries must be carried on
hereafter upon a large scale. Only by great combi
nations of capital, by the establishment of large
plants, and by purchasing supplies and selling
products at wholesale rates, can such lines of business
be conducted profitably in face of the intense com
petition of our times.
The only question of doubt in the matter is to de
termine what industries can be profitably developed
in that way. Up to this time the teaching of expe
rience seems that most rural industries are most
profitable when conducted on a comparatively small
scale. An orchard of a thousand acres rarely yields
as much in proportion as one of ten acres, nor have
the big ranches of many thousands of acres been as
profitably worked as small farms. On the other hand,
most manufacturing work has been found to be profit
able exactly in proportion to the extent of the plant
and the annual amount of the output.
The line of separation between the two classes of
work, however, cannot be drawn along that which
distinguishes farm work from factory work. There
are some kinds of rural industry, like that of sugar
producing, that can be best carried on when under
taken upon a large scale, and, on the other hand,
there are several kinds of manufacturing work that
are better managed in small shops than in large fac
tories.
The prevailing tendency of the time, however, is
toward the formation of large combinations, and it
would appear that fruit-packing is one of the trades
that can be best managed in that way. It is an in
dustry that is exposed to the illegitimate competition
of adulterated or sophisticated fruit preserves, it has
to contend against the practice of false labeling,
which prevails to such an extent in all parts of the
United States, and, finally,. it is a trade that has to
seek markets in all parts of the world, and therefore
needs large capital or a thorough system of co
operative management for its full development.
Certain it is that California must follow the great
States of the East and the nations of Europe in this
respect, or her industries will be crowded to the wall
despite any protection that a tariff can give. As was
recently stated by Governor Flower of New York,
any. combination which enables an article of staple
use to be placed upon the market at a cheaper rate to
consumers is sure to be profitable if judiciously man
aged. That is the principle on which all great com
binations for industrial enterprises have been made,
and its soundness seems indisputable.
PURE FOOD Lf-IWS IN ILLINOIS.
ILLINOIS is now to be added to the States that
have taken steps to protect consumers against
fraudulent and impure foods. An act has been re
cently adopted which is said to be very stringent in
its nature, and the supporters of the crusade for pure
food are sanguine it will produce results of the high
est benefit to the community. In fact, the Inter Ocean
says if the Legislature had done no more than enact
that one law it would not have assembled in vain.
We have had reasons for suspecting that California
has been the dumping ground of all kinds of adul
terated food, but evidence submitted to the Illinois
Legislature inclines to the* belief that Chicago has
fared worse than San Francisco, and that the peo
ple of Illinois have been consuming not only worse
things but a much larger variety of worse things
than have ever been dumped into our market.
Adulteration of food is now practiced to such an
extent that even the cheapest foods are no longer
pure. Articles sold to consumers at so low a price
that one would suppose any sort of adulteration to be
unprofitable are still subject to fraud. Thus it is
noted that a man in search of New Orleans open
kettle molasses could find only one place in Chicago
where the unadulterated article could be secured, and
this in spite of the fact that the pure article costs only
18 cents per gallon. He found hundreds of places
where an article was sold in neatly printed and la
beled tin cans, "guaranteed pure N. O. O. K. mo
lasses," but not a grain of the golden yellow svgar â
a sure test of the pure article could be found in the
bottom of the cans.
It is recognized that a considerable proportion of
the adulterated foods are not absolutely harmful to
health, and therefore the Illinois law permits the sale
of such articles provided they are distinctly labeled
and branded so that every purchaser may know
exactly what they contain. An important feature of
the bill refers to candies and confectioneries, as it
has been found that much of the cheap candy is so
adulterated as to be virtually a mixture of vile com
pounds and seriously injurious to the health of chil
dren, who are the more tempted by it because they
can get what is commonly called "an all day lick" for
about a penny.
By a curious clause of the law it is provided that it
shall not go into effect until July, 1900. That gives
the dealers in impure food something more than a
year in which to work off their frauds and their
poisons. The law in effect declares that certain prac
tices are fraudulent and dangerous, and yet in defer
ence to those who are engaged in them the suppres
sion of them will be postponed until all the vile stuff
now on their hands can be disposed of upon an un
suspecting public. Bad as that provision is for Il
linois, it may perhaps be beneficial to the rest of the
country. Had the law been put into force at once
the Chicago adulterations might have been shipped
elsewhere and other communities would have suf
fered because Illinois is virtuous.
The twelve monkeys which were thrown overboard
from the transport ships to prevent the spread of
smallpox died in vain, and it is evident the practice
of quarantine by drowning harmless animals is not a
success.
"Shaking the plum tree" yields very poor fruit as
a rule, but we seem to have got the worst green Gage
in the bunch.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
CHINESE EDITOR ON POLL TAX.
-To the Editor of the Call-Dear Sir: Knowing as Ido the honesty -and Impar
tiality of your widely read and influential journal. I take the Â»hert> Â°* aG
dressing you on the present occasion in regard to a practical grievance anect
ing the Chinese community. - . _.._'â __â* âââ i) .
I am perfectly well aware that the poll tax should be lawfully and *^ vi tably
assessed, but I respectfully maintain that all subject to the tax should be ' treated
alike. Many a time and oft it has been my unhappy experience to notice in
rough and rude, not to say unjust, way wherein Chinese are treated in tne col
lection of. the tax. , How different is the treatment accorded to men of otner " a "
tionalities! It is by no means unusual for Deputy Assessors to stand at <_"
ferry and rudely assail Chinese, demanding at the same time the immediate pro
duction of the poll tax receipt, under circumstances very humiliating Â«*
Chinese self-respect, and threatening, should the request not be Imm^t^y
complied with, to take away by violent means whatever property the Â°" I^= c
may have in their possession or carry in their hands, while Americans and peo
ple of the other nationalities are treated with justice and courtesy by the very
same Assessors. Nor should it be forgotten that Chinese on their return trom
their native land are forced by the Deputy Assessors on their way to Chinatown
in wagons to pay the poll tax, failing in which their trunks and other effects are
taken possession of, to be redeemed only when the friends of the Chinese de
liver to the deputies the $2 demanded. As some of these Chinese are country mer
chants, it is oftentimes very difficult for them to obtain at once $2.
In conclusion, Mr. Editor, thanking you for your courtesy, I may be permitted
to add that I like all my countrymen to comply with the law, but at the same
time I hate to see them treated as an inferior class of human beings. Yours
respectfully; TONG K. CHONG,
Editor of San Francisco Chinese Worid.
FEATHER RIVER IMPROVEMENT.
Editor San Francisco Call: Congressman Marion de Vries of Stockton came
up to view the Feather River Saturday, at the request of the citizens, as they
wished him to see the necessity of obtaining immediate aid from the Federal
Government.
The navigability of Feather River is of vast importance, as it is the direct
outlet for a large scope of valuable productive and rich section of country.
Levee District No. 2 has been fighting the battles alone for the last twenty
five years, which has been such a burden that the property holders have be
come very much embarrassed, and if Government aid is not received Feather
River will cease to be navigable soon and a large scope of valuable country be
ruined. Feather River has never had any Government work done on it yet, and
it is high time something is done to keep it in the banks. J. J. WATSON.
Nicolaus, Cal., April 25, 1899.
IMPERIALISM, NOT DEMOCRACY.
Editor San Francisco Call: You're all right. Keep hitting it. Imperial-
Ism is not democracy. Thousands are gaining more encouragement from the
bold stand you have taken against what amounts to treason against the only
America 1 and any other genuine American cares to recognize.

Muller Loses His Memory.
1 **â¢*â¢ steamer Rival arrived from Clip
perton Island yesterday after a passage
of thirteen days. She brought four pas
sengers and a cargo of guano : for
Macondray & Co. The passengers were
men who were left on the island last year
to work the guano beds and get a cargo
ready for the return of the steamer. It
was quite rough while the Rival was at
Cllpperton and it took considerable time
to lighter the stuff from the shore to the
vessel. The men who returned from the
island say the crabs are just as big as
ever and Clipperton the dreariest spot
on in. face of the earth.

A POINT IN CASINOâ H. X.. City. In
playing casino a player may throw a card
on one on the table, ..ay. a four upon a

can place an ace on that build and call
it ten; but at the time he does so he must
have a ten to take it with in case the
first player has not a ten with which he
can take it. Should the second player
not have a ten he would be charged with
having made a false Duild and he would
forfeit the game.
OLIVESâ J. IL, City. Dr. Remondlno,
at one time a member of the State Board
of Health, said of the olive: "If preven
tion is better than cure, Americans should
cultivate the taste, habit and use of the
olive; it is eminently and essentially na
ture's food for the variable and either ex
treme weather of* the middle regions,
where animal fats would be injurious dur
ing the nearly tropical heat of the sum
mer. Statistics have shown that among
the French troops serving in Africa those
coming from the southern and largely
olive consuming provinces are not as
subject to hepatic or liver diseases as
their more animal-dieted fellow soldiers
coming from the Rhine or Belgian bor
der."

THE TELEPHONEâ Subscriber, City.
The principle of the telephoneâ that is
to say, that sounds could be conveyed to
a distance by means of a distended wire
was demonstrated by Robert Hook in 1667,
but no practical application of the prin
ciple was made of the discovery until 1821,
when Professor Wheatstone exhibited his
enchanted lyre, by which the sounds of
a music-box were conveyed from a cellar
to upper rooms. The first true discoverer
of the speaking telephone is said to have
been Johann Philip Reis, a German scien
tist and professor in the Institute at
Frederichshof. On the 25th of April. 1861,
he exhibited at Frankfort his telephone,
which contained all the essential features
of the modern telephone. He failed to
arouse an interest in his discovery, and
died in 1874 without having reaped any
advantage from it. In the meantime the
idea was being worked into more practical
shape by Professor Elisha Gray and Pro
fessor Alexander Bell, and later by Thom
as Edison. Gray's successful experiments
antedate those of Bell, but the latter was
the first to perfect his patent. On Febru
ary 12, 1877, Bell's articulating telephone
was tested in Boston, Mass., and sounds
were distinctly heard at Salem, eighteen
miles away. The Examiner of Patents at
Washington. D. C, on July 21, 1883, de
cided that Professor Bell was the first
inventor because he was the first to
complete his invention and secure a full
patent.
GRAIN CASES TO

Forty-Three Thousand Dollars to Be
Taken Out of the Treasury and
Nothing to Show
for It.
Pursuant to instructions contained In
the Blackstock resolution adopted re
cently by the Board of Railroad Commis
sioners. Attorney General Ford yester
day filed in the United States Circuit
Court a notice to the Southern Pacific
Company that next Monday morning at
10 o'clock he would move to dismiss the
action brought by the railroad com;
to restrain the Commissioners from put
ting in force the reductions in the freight
schedule adopted by the previous Board
of Railroad Commissioners. The motion
to dismiss will be supplemented by a mo
tion that each side pay its own costs.
The Blackstock resolution rescinded and
repealed the resolution adopted Septem
ber 26, 1895, reducing grain rates 8 per cent
and reducing' all other classes of freight
25 per cent. As the suit was brought by
the railroad company to prevent the Com
missioners from putting the new rates in
to effect, and as the obnoxious resolution
has been repealed, it is believed that the
railroad company will not oppose the mo
tion to dismiss, the purposes of their
suit having been accomplished in an
i easier way.
The motion that each side pay its own
â  costs is to the advantage of the railroad
! company, for the costs accrued on be
i half of the State, according to Mr. Black
! stock's estimate, have already reached
; upward of $43,000, and according to the
estimate made by the Attorney General
in his report to the Legislature they
would amount to $110,000 if fought to a
, finish. This would be a neat little sum
for the railroad to pay in case it should
be defeated in the trial before the Cir
i cuit Court, as it certainly would be.
But the majority of the Board of Rail
. road Commissioners have removed this
I item of expense to the railroad corpora
! tion and have placed it upon the shoul
ders of the taxpayers.

McGLADE MAY
ESCAPE ON A
TECHNICALITY
Important Point for
Cook to Decide.
â â
EVIDENCE MAY BE BARRED
â â
EIGHT OVER THE ADMISSION
OF DOCUMENTS.
- â â
Defense Claims the Alleged Forged
Claim Was Void on Its Face
and Should Never Have
Been Allowed.
The fate of Peter W. McG!ad-> will prob
ably be determined this morning, when
Superior Judge Carrol' Cook will render
his decision on the admissibility as evi
dence of the forged document by means
of which the former deputy Street Super
intendent is alleged to have swindled tht
,_ ty out of $96. Should the objections of
Attorney Patrick Reddy on behalf of the
defendant be sustained and the incrim
inating document barred, the prosecution
will come to naught, for the piece of
paper over which the technical battle was
waged all of yesterday is the sole basis
for the case of the prosecution. On the
other hand, if the document is admitted
the conviction of MeGlade appears prac
tically certain to follow.
The specific charge on which the ex
deputy is being tried is but one of a
number of similar charge? pending, but as
all are based on forged documents similar
in all essential details to the one in con
troversy, the decision of the court, if ad
verse to the prosecution, will naturally
result in the discharge of the prisoner.
Ir. substance the defendant contends
that the document or demand on which
the money was obtained was not a de
mand which the Board nf Supervisors,
the Treasurer or the Auditor was author
ized by law to allow, even if genuine, and
that the allowance of the demand was
contrary to law; that the indorsement of !
said demand by MeGlade as deputy Su
perintendent of Streets is not the subject
of forgery for the reason that it was not
a forgery for the defendant to sign his
own name; that the certificate signed by
Thomas J. Clark, a clerk in the office of
the Superintendent of Streets, was, upon
its face, illegal and void, as it was not
signed in the name of his principal; that
there was no authority in taw authoriz
ing T. B. McGlnnis, as assistant clerk of
the Board of Supervisors or otherwise, to
â  :*r.:r*:ster oaths, and his jurat, which
appears on the face of the demand, is
therefore void. In fact. Attorney Reddy
. '.aimed that every indorsement that ap
***> ears on the back of the claim or demand
is illegal and void: and he further claimed
that there was no allegation in the com
plaint that the document was ever pre
sented for payment to the Treasurer.
The attorney quoted copiously from a
stack of lawbooks to convince the court
that his contentions were well founded.
Assistant District Attorney Black, who
la conducting the prosecution, argued that
the claims of the defendant's counsel
were in most instances very far-fetched
and that the indorsements that appear on
the demand alleged to have been pre
sented and cashed by MeGlade were borne
by hundreds of other claims filed at the
same time, the legality of which has
never been questioned; and that the in
dorsing of claims by officials referred to
as well as the administering of oaths by
an assistant clerk of the Board of Super
visors are of daily occurrence.
He maintained that the court should
not allow a tangle of technical objections
raised by the defense to obscure the fact
that the criminal tent had been shown
by the defendant.
The court promised to render a decision
on the point involved at 10 o'clock this
morning.

.
Societies Are All Operating Under
Charters and the Owners Think
Police Can Be Kept
Out.
The activity of Sergeant Donovan and
sauad in Chinatown has practically put a
j stop to all fantan games at the regular
; clubs. A? was told exclusively in The
Call a f^w days ago a new schema has
; been introduced which blocks the same?.
I The 'police are now traveling around in
j er-uples and each club if visited at I^ast
j four times an hour. If any loiterer? are
! found in the club rooms they are prompts
â  ly turned out.
This severe discipline is galling to the
! Chinese. They did lot particularly ob
i ject to the spasmodic raids when a door
; or two would be battered down and a
i hunch of gamblers taken into custody;
It was very easy to -I raw on the funds
of the society which owned the club raid
ed and pay the fines. But now that all
i business has been stopped for over a
i week the Mongolians ar^ becoming de
i spondent and have determined to reply
} to the United States courts for relief.
It is not generally known, but it Is
i nevertheless a fact that all the gambling
1 clubs in Chinatown nold charters from
,' the Secretary of State, many of them
! dating back for twenty years or more.
i exactly the same as thosp held by the
Pacific Union, the Bohemian or any 'other
white man's club. The police neither raid
nor systematically visit the clubs of the
I white men. so the Chinese have finally
; decided that they have just as much right
!to run clubs as their lighter skinned ;
i hrethren.
In view of this fact a prominent firm
! of attorneys has been engaged to take
! care of the clubs. Twenty-rive Chinese
I socfeties have come together and sub
[ scribed a handsome retainer for the law
' yers. The fir?- action taken will be an
! application in the Federal courts for an
! injunction restraining the police from vis
! king clubs, breaking down doors or in- \
! any way interfering with their business.
It is confidently believed by the attor- :
; neys that th<\v will win without the :
i slightest difficulty, as the clubs are each !
| running under an authorized charter and !
! the police have no authority to enter them !
i without a search warrant.

pleasure and comfort of those who go
has been made. An unusually large
list of gate and game prizes will be

FRIEND OF THE REINDEER
EN ROUTE TO FAR NORTH
REV. DR. SHELDON JACKSON.
REV. DR. SHELDON JACKSON. United States General Agent of Edu
cation in Alaska, arrived from Washington, D. C. , yesterday and regis
tered at the Palace. Pr Jacks i is a member of the Educational Bu
reau of the Department of the Interior and will leave on the revenue
cutter Thetis for the purpose of purchasing reindeer in the Russian posses
sions in Siberia. Congress lately appropriated $25,000 in order to replace the
depleted herds it the Teller reindeer station In Alaska. Five hundred of
the animals were used in the exhibition sent to Point Barrow some time ago
for the relief of the ice-imprisoned whalers
** Dr. Jackson has been identified for the last twenty-two years in efforts Â£J
8 to save and educate the native population of Alaska. In 1-77 he began a R
a mission at Fort Wrangel in the name of the Presbyterian church. The In- ,-*>
jg defatigable work of his man cannot he easily computed. Suffice it to say Â£?
0 that there are now ten Presbyterian stations, namely: Wrangel. St. Law- 0
Â»*, rence Island; Juneau; Haines. Hoonah, Sitka. Saxman, Jackson, Point Bar- *_?
row and Skaguay. Ministers are now on the way to establish three more R
R at Circle City. Rampart and Eagle. q
*- t His reports to the Interior Department from 1885 down to the present ot
g time cover a wide range regarding the conditions prevailing in Alaska and re
0 have proved invaluable. These reports give comprehensive data on tea- 0
.* tion in the northwest territory, schools for Indian children, on the agri- â¢*
0 cultural resources of and the introduction of reindeer into Alaska. 8
*? Part of the year he is in Alaska and a part he is at Washington, fur- *.â¢
R nishing information and aiding the Commissioner of Education in administer- â¢__
0 ing the schools. The enormous distances which he travels will be under- .V
2* stood by the statement that his annual trip Includes some 17.000 miles by R
V land and water, now in the majestic steamer or the dory or the great dug- a
i out of the natives. But the least indicative of the man is his gift of $50,000 Â£â¢
.*. to found a Christian college in Utah. 8
.* "The first reindeer station." said Dr. Jackson in an interview, "was es- .*
0 tablished at Port Clarence, which is considered the best harbor on Bering R
â¢* Sea. The forwarders of the enterprise obtained 171 deer and established the *Â£-;
v station near the point chosen for the proposed Russia-American telegraph 8
V; in _867. The new station was named Teller in honor of Henry M. Teller of "w
R Colors. to whose ardent efforts the success of obtaining active Congres- gj
0 slona! support for the great enterprise was due. 0
*,â¦, "Every difficulty that was raised against the habilitation of reindeer in %*
O. the northwest has been entirely surmounted. The Siberians are perfectly re
O willing to sell them and the deer take quite kindly to their new home and Â£.â¢
_? reproduce their kind. There are now oyer 2000 reindeer domesticated in v
R Alaska, but the 500 sent to the relief of the whalers at Point Barrow makes _
it necessary to procure at least that many more. The near future will see '-.
iÂ« great herds of the wonderfully useful animals all through the ice-bound in- Â§
0 terior of Alaska and British Columbia." R

WITH A BRIEF
DEFENSE NEALL
CLOSED HIS CASE
Plea That He Was 1 11
and Overworked.
â â
SUDDEN ENDING OF THE TRIAL
â â¦ â
!
THE ACCUSED CONTRADICTED
I NONE OF THE EVIDENCE.
i
.
Relies on the Technical Point That
Dividends Had Never Been Le
i
gaily Declared From the
Post Exchange.
The defense in the case against Lieu
tenant Neall has opened and closed, and
the case has been finished so far as the
taking of testimony is concerned. Mr.
Thornton, Neall's attorney, promised that
his case would not take more than two
days. Yesterday morning hp modified this
to one day. and then in the afternoon
he took up the defense and finished It
within half an. hour.
The defense has been foreshadowed by
the questions counsel for the defense has
been putting to the witness all through
the trial. Neall was ill and overworked
is the contention, but beyond that there
will also be the claim that he could not
have paid any of the unfortunate divi
dends which have landed him In such a
peck of trouble because they were never
legally declared. Colonel Compton testi
fied that he refused to approve the divi
dends declared for January because they
were not made out by the exchange coun
cil or even by a majority of it. Under
these circumstances the dividend could
not have been paid is the c....m of the
defense; but it is also in evidence that no
such excuse as that was ever given by
Neall for his failure to pay. He put it
on the ground that he would have to get
the Nolan checks indorsed, and this was
shown to have been but a flimsy excuse,
and those to whom it was made brand It
as a deliberate attempt at deception. De
ception is conduct unbecoming an officer
and a gentleman, and that is the most
serious charge against Neall. The mere
fact that he had no right to pay the divi
dends, even should It be so shown, does
not mitigate the charge of deception.
The last witness was called by . the
court. It was Captain Pratt, one of the
members of the court, who commands
Battery E of the Third Artillery. He
was called to tell that in the beginning
of February he received a dividend of
over $60 from the post exchange paid by
Neall because of the withdrawal of Bat
tery E from the Presidio to new quarters
at Fort Mason. The Intent of this was
to show that while Neall was refusing to
pay dividends on the ground of the fail
ure to get the checks indorsed, he did
pay one of the dividends and the infer
ence is that he could pay them all less |
the amount of the checks, and that he '
knew this to be the case.
The principal part of the defense was
the reading and the Identification of the i
orders issued last May detailing Neall to
the various duties which the defense al- >
lege finally broke his health. He was as
signed to the duty of laying out the
camps for all the troops, volunteers and
regulars, not part of the garrison of the
Presidio; he was made commissary and
quartermaster md was appointed* to a
board to survey mules; he was give
charge of the policing of the post and
the temporary camps and in addition had
his duties as commander of Troop B, his
own troop. All these orders were Iden
tified by Major Edward Field. Second Ar
tillery, and acting inspector general, who I
was at that time acting adjutant gen- i
eral.
The orders having been read. Mr.
Thornton read the following extract from
the rules governing the post exchange:
Distribution of profitsâ When an exchange is
absolutely free from debt a sum sufficient to
cover all anticipated expenses for at least one
month will, at the end of each quarter, or
oftener if deemed advisable by the council and
Commanding officer. Be taken from the cash
on hand and set aside as a reserve fund, and
the remainder, which will represent the net
profits of the exchange for the period specified
will be disposed of in the following manner':
(a) Five per cent will be paid into the regi
mental fund if a band be serving at the post:
(b) such sum as the council, with the approval
of the commanding officer, may determine will

The remaining money may be divided among
the organizations contributing to the exchange,
on such equitable basis as shall be determined
by the council, with the approval of the com

respect arise between the council and the com
manding officer the decision of the department
commander will be final. The money thus dis
tributed will be paid into the company or de

for the hospital detachment the proportionate
amounts for the sick in the hospital Who belong
to the various companies or detachments that
are members of the exchange wilt be turned
over to the surgeon. Any variation from these
rules requires the sanction of the Secretary of
War.
It was then announced that the defense
had closed Its case.
For the first time Neall appeared in
the double bars of the captain's rank, and
during the afternoon it was* formally an
nounced by the judge advocate that the
accused had received his commission as Â»
captain and that he was entitled to the
title and priveliges of that rank.
The case will not be argued orally un
less the written arguments which M.
Thornton and Judge Advocate Noble will
prepare are thought insufficient by the
court. Mr. Thornton asked three days in
which to prepare his argument and he
promised to submit it to the Judge ad
vocate next Saturday afternoon. The
judge advocate then announced that un
der those circumstances he would have
his answering argument ready by Monday
morning, and to that time the court ad
journed. ______^__^^___

ROLL OF HONOR.
One of tne Native Sons of the Golden
West Who Served in the Vol
unteer Service.
The grand secretary of the Native Sons
of the Golden West has called the atten
tion of all the parlors In the State to the
roll of honor of the members of the order
who have done or are now doing service
in the Philippines. In his letter to the par
iols he says:
So many members of the order have enlisted
in the service of our country that a record of
their names would make an interesting roll of
honor. If the secretaries will kindly furnish
me with the names of their members who have
enlisted in the army or navy, I will take pleas
ure in preparing a rolf of honor, which will
become of historic Interest long after our boys
have returnedâ as we pray they mayâ from the
victorious fields of tropical countries to the
peaceful "land of sunshine, fruit and flowers."
It is probable that some of the secretaries
failed to comply with the request, and it is
possible that there may be errors in this list.
If the delegates from the parlors will kindly
notify me of omissions or errors I shall be
clad to make corrections before making this
roll an enduring record ln the proceedings of
this Grand Parlor.
If there are errors or omissions in this list,
or parlcrs whose names have not yet been re
ported, the secretaries will please report them
to me within one week, as the reports go to
press on May S. 1*93.

Administrators to Spare.
Four applications for letters of adminis
tration upon the estate of the late Ed
ward Barrett, filed by J. Duffy. Theresa
Hartnett, J. Daly and the Public Admin
istrator, were heard by Judge Coffey yes
terday. Barrett died intestate a short
time since, leaving an only daughter, Mrs.
the municipal home at the direction of -6
men who, even .hough they have^
more learning, draw less salary. Buty
coal oil! This was awful. The Sheriff .Â£
groaned, not beneath his own weightâ *?
he is used to thatâ but the weight ofÂ£
his woes. Still he did not wish toX
turn his own keys upon himself. htt-Â§
close himself in a bastile under his-_;

SUFFERERS.
The New Cure for Kidney, Bladder
and Upie Acid Troubles.
*
Almost everybody who reads the
newspapers is sure to know of Swamp-
Root, the great kidney remedy.
It is the great medical triumph of the
nineteenth century; discovered after
years of scientific research by the emi-
nent kidney and bladder specialist, Dr.
Kilmer, and has truly wonderful pow-
ers in curing kidney, liver, bladder and
; uric acid diseases.
Kidney trouble is -responsible for
more sickness and sudden deaths than
any other disease, and is so deceptive
that thousands have it without know-
ing it.
Thousands owe their health and even
life to Swamp-Root and thousands
more who to-day think themselves be-
yond help can be made well by the use
of this great remedy.
Swamp-Root has been tested in so
many ways, in hospial work, in private
practice, among the helpless, too poor
to purchase relief, and has proved so
successful in every case that a special
arrangement has been made by which
all readers of The Call, who have not
already tried it, may have a sample
bottle sent absolutely free by mail.
Also a book telling more about Swamp-
Root and containing some of the thou-
sands upon thousands of testimonial
letters received from men and women
who owe their good health, in fact,
their very lives, to the wonderful cura-
tive properties of Swamp-Root. Be
sure and mention the San Francisco
Daily Call when sending your address
to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton. N. Y.
If you are already convinced that
Swamp-Root is what you need, you can
purchase the regular fifty-cent and one-
: dollar sizfl bottles at drugstores.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW* YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 3.â The stock market
moved In an uncertain manner to-day and
left off generally lower with the declines most
accentuated In the coalers. Consolidated Gas,
Sugar and American Spirits. Commission
house business was small and London and
some professionals realized on stocks bought
nt the low figures yesterday. Much of the
buying appeared to be covering of shorts. The
early trading continued the strength of yes
terday's trading, but realizing sales on the
theory that the recovery nao been too rapid
took the snap out of the market. The weak
ness of the coalers was on heavy sales by a
prominent holder who had been carrying a
long line of these properties. Disappointment
was expressed in some quarters that no an
nouncement was forthcoming concerning a coal
deal, now that the New Jersey Legislature
has been adjourned for some time. The steel
and wire stocks displayed firmness on the be
lief that negotiations were pending to con
solidate a number of properties. Although
nothing positive as to details could he learned,
it was said that a capitalization of over half
a billion dollars was contemplated. The P r>
pllcation of American Steel and Wire to he
listed by the exchange, together with dividend
gossip was an aid to that stock. Brooklyn
Rapid Transit fluctuated widely and closed
with over a point advance. People's Gas and
Pacific Mail were also strong. The general
railways list was fractionally lower. Consoli
dated Gas recovered somewhat, but on the in
creased cutting of gas prices again broke sev
eral points and closed nearly two off on the
day. The arrangement to retire the first pre
ferred stock of Minneapolis and St. Louis
caused a rlFe of over four points In the sec
ond preferred. The closing of pool accounts
In American Spirits and Sugar was said to
account for the weakness In these properties.
The market closed weak. Most of the prominent
bond Issues scored improvements to-day wit
the advances quite irked in some Instances,
uotal sales, $ fc ,l,-.* ,000.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, May 3.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
Aside from the purchases made by a local
dealer on speculative account and the rale of
a considerable amount of Australian wool In
bond for export, there has been really very
little business done in the past week. The
transactions referred to, however, added to
what has been actually taken for manufac
turers' use, bringing the total of the week's
business up to a large amount; nearly 68.000,
--000 poundsâ and there is reason for believing
that this does not represent all that has been
done, some of the houses not reporting all of
their sales. - !.- V/'Â«*

Prior to the passim** of sentence on Wil
liam A. Brandes. Judge Hall to-day lis
tened patiently to the arguments of At
torneys Sawyer and Bennett on motion
for a new trial. This proved a tedious
review, and frequently the court appeared
slightly annoyed.
Brandes' attorneys based their client's
right to a new trial upon errors in the
court's instructions, improper conduct of
the jurors and the prosecution; that there
was no evidence to warrant a verdict of
murder ln the second degree, since no
malice had been shown; and that the
photographs made by E. R. Jackson,
which purported to portray the bruises
on the dead girl's body, should not have
been admitted.
The defense also submitted affidavits of
Attorney Bennett to the effect that Jurors
B. S. Marston, A. L. Brown. A. A. Jonas,
A. J. Long and Philip Sieben had stated
to him that from the testimony and at the
time of the verdict they did believe that
Lillian Brandes came to her death by
blows delivered upon her head by "VV. A.
Brandes, but at the time of the delivery
of these blows they (the jurors) did not
believe the defendant had malice or
hatred of or against Lillian; but that the
blows were delivered without intent to
kill and that in the cause of correcting
her defendant had beaten her more than
he Intended:
These affidavits Judge Hall ruled in
admissible, saying that the only Instance
in which verdicts might be thus im
peached is in tbe case of lance verdicts.
It had also been claimed by Brandt at
torneys that there was no evidence to
..how that a deadly weapon had been
used. The court on this point held that
It had been shown that the girl had been
struck on the bead with something pro
ducing meningitis. As to the question of
malice, the court said it was shown be
yond all question of doubt that the de
fendant believed his daughter had stolen
$15. and this created the provoking
cause of malice. The evidence supports
the jury in its conclusion of malice afore
thought. The introduction of the photo
graphs the court held was merely a
method of describing objects and was
clearly admissible. In conclusion Judge
Hall denied the motion for a new trial and
commanded Brandes to stand up.
Brandes, who had been seated beside
his wife, Etta Brandes. and their little
son. Milton, arose and stepped directly in
front of the clerk's desk and below the
Judge's bench. Judge Hall then briefly
reviewed the facts of Brandes' case, de
claring that the jury that tried him had
been selected with (Treat care and were
men of exceptionally high character; that
the case had been carelully presented and
the conduct of the attorneys for the State
had been fair and humane. In conclusion
Judge Hall said:
it now remains for me to pronounce the
Judgment of the law. I will not worry you
by detailing the circumstances of the case

If one cares for good, sturdy health
with which to build up a business or
peacefully and happily conduct a
household, attention must be paid to
the food. Bad food, or good food poor-
ly cooked, causes dyspepsia, poorly
nourished bodies and general irritation.
People ho use Grape-Nuts for
breakfast can depend op having the
highest quality of nourishment, and
that perfectly cooked, for the food is
finished at the factory and goes into
the packages crisp, fully cooked and
ready for Instant use with either hot
milk or cream or with cold thick cream
or syrup.
Either form gives a delicious dish
hat one craves morning after morning,
and brain-workers notice a distinct
gain in mental power, for the delicate
particles of natural phosphate of pot-
ash ken from the grains unites with
the albumen and goes directly to re-
build brain and nerve centers.
To find the proof in one's own body
is the best argument. * Try Grape-
Nuts ten days. A good sturdy set of
brains may start you into a great

HER MANDOLIN WILL ENTRANCE
AUDIENCES OF THE OLD WORLD
MISS JULIA NOY Accepts a Most Flattering Offer
From Paris.
ALAMEDA, May Miss Julia Noy, one of the most prominent of Ala
meda's young society ladies, will depart Wednesday for Paris to, ac
cept a most flattering offer to take the part of first mandolin in a sep
tet organized by Professor Joseph Bancho, to give a series of concerts
in the French capital, to be followed by a professional tour throughout
the countries of Europe.
That Professor Sancho should find It to his advantage to send to
California for a mandolin player Wh.n he had the choice of the most expert
performers of the Old World is considered a flattering tribute to Miss Noy'S
talent as a musician. The young lady is a graduate of the Columbian
School of Art of San Francisco, and would have adopted the stage as a pro
fession long ago had it not been for the strenuous objections of her father.
Professor Sancho ''amp to California about ten years ago as a member
of the famous Spanish Students and remained In San Francisco until a year
ago as a teacher of the mandolin. Miss Noy was one of his pupils. He con
sidered her the most accomplished member of. his class and gave as his opin
ion that her equal as a mandolin player could not be found on the coast.
Professor Sancho went to Paris about a year ago. Recently he had offers of
concert engagements and he arranged for a season to begin May 14. He
wrote Miss Noy, asking her to join his company, but again her father's ob-.
jections stood in the way of accepting. To Intimate friends she confided that
she had determined to take advantage of the opportunity to go to Paris, and
that if her father could not be reconciled to her departure she would be
forced to defy his wishes.
Sunday Professor Sancho renewed his offer by cablegram, and Mr. Noy
finally consented that his daughter might satisfy her ambition. In the septet
Professor Sancho will play the bandurria, his wife the lute and Miss Say
the mandolin. The other instruments In the septet will be taken by French
and Spanish musicians. It is intended to make the organization one of the
leading of its kind in France, lf not in all Europe.
Miss Noy is the eldest daughter of W. H. Noy of 1536 Pay street. She is
a brunette of very striking features and figure. She Is about 21 years of
age and has resided in Alameda since childhood. Her skill as a musician
is well known here, where her playing has often been heard at public con
certs and social gatherings. She has been a popular figure in society, and
while her many friends regret that she is going to leave them, they rejoice
at her deserved good fortune in gaining so prominent and nattering a posi
tion in the musical world.
Suffice It to nay that in my judgment the
crime was amply proved and the verdict
of the Jury was Just, and the circumstances .
of the crime merit the judgment I am now
about to pronounce upon you.
It Is th" Judgment of this court that you,
W. A. I'randes. for a crime of which you
have been found guilty in this court, be
confined In the State's Prison at San Quen
tin for the term of your natural life. You
are now remanded to the custody of the
Sheriff for the execution of this Judgment.
Brandes' then raised his right hand and
1 proclaimed his Innocence in the words
given above, and, walking over to his wife
and son, embraced them and wept wildly.
< His case will be appealed to the Supreme
Court and a certificate of probable cause
staying execution of Judgment has been
1 Issued.
The matter of Etta Brandes, also
, charged with the murder of Lillian, was
then brought up on habeas corpus pro
ceedings, but on motion of District At
torney Allen she was forthwith dis
! charged and given her free*_om.
A SENATOR'S APOLOGY.
Samuel Braunhart Thought He Was
Superior to the Law, but Found
He Was Mistaken.
Owing to the fact that Senator Samuel
Braunhart, Port Warden, considered
himself superior to the law, the case of
Robert Mlnar, Frank Rodgers and W.
Harney, charged with cruelty to animals
by Secretary Hoibrook ln dragging cattle
on board ship by the horns Instead of by
slings, had to be postponed in Judge Gra
ham's court yesterday till to-morrow.
Braunhart is the principal witness for
the prosecution, and wnen the case was
called Bailiff O'Connor shouted his name
three times at the door of the courtroom,
but he failed to respond. Another wit
ness explained to the Judge that Braun
hart had told him in the morning to be
sure and be In court, otherwise an at
tachment would be Issued against him;
but he was beyond that, and as he could
not attend the Judge would not dare is
sue an attachment against him.
' This statement not only surprised but
incensed the Judge, and he promptly or
dered an attachment Issued against
Braunhart and continued the case till to
morrow. The attachment was sent to the
harbor police station to be served, but
Braunhart got wind of it and hurried
AGED MRS. CLAPP
BURNED TO DEATH
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, 90S Broadway, May 3.
MRS. RUTH (LAPP was burned to death to-day in West Oakland, as
the result of dropping a lighted coal oil lamp. Her husband, Dr.
Clapp, is partially paralyzed and was almost unable to help his aged
wife, even while she lay on the floor In fearful agony, with all her
clothes in flames. There is some doubt regarding the origin of the
fatality, as Mrs. Clapp died before she could give any explanation to her
husband, who was the only other occupant .of the house at the corner of
Chase and Campbell streets. Dr. Clapp says that he was ln the kitchen
preparing to light a fire, having left his wife in the bedroom. As she did
not appear he went to the room and found It to be full of smoke. After
opening the window, he saw his wife on the floor with her clothes on fire.
The woman had fallen on top of the lamp. Her husband, although partial
ly helpless, succeeded in subduing the flames and at once summoned help.
Several doctors responded, but the woman only lived till noon, never regain
ing consciousness.
"I cannot tell how It happened." said the sorrow-stricken husband; "but
as my wife was subject to fainting spells, I think one must have overtaken
her while carrying the lamp. She was unconscious when I found her in
flames on the floor and only for a moment did she appear to gain conscious
ness afterward. About an hour before her death I asked her if I should put
a pillow under her head, and she whispered. "No; it is no use.' That was
all she said." "'..""**'.-'

ham and apologized to him for not being
in attendance as a witness, and said he
meant no disrespect to the court. The
Judge accepted the apology and sent

THE LEAGUE DISPLEASED.
It Passes Resolutions Censuring the
Legislature for Not Electing
a Senator.
There was a warm time at the meeting
of the Continental League, which was
held it Saratoga Hall last night. Presi
dent F. D. Worth presided and there was
a large attendance of the members of
the club. The fun commenced when H.
S. Linnell, chairman of the finance com
mittee, proposed the following resolution:
Whereas, At the last general election held
in the State of California, In November. 1898,
the people of that State elected to the Legis
lature gentlemen who were pledged to elect
a succssor to the Hon. Stephen M. White, then
United States Senator. That having become
displeased with the said Senator they elected
those representing the Republican party. Hav
ing been in session seventy days they, tho
representatives of the people, failed to elect
such successor. Therefore, be It
Resolved. That the Contln'Sual League of
the city and county of San Francisco deplores
the action of said Legislature in not giving
to the State and to the administration a
United States Senator. That it considers those
member- of the legislature, who steadfastly
refused to enter into and abide by the de
cision of a party caucus, as false to their
trust In considering their own personal desires
to the obligation they owed their constituents
and the Republican party.
Resolved. That a copy of these resolutions
be spread upon the minutes and that a copy
be girt I to each of the dally papers.
After much discussion the resolutions
were adopt) d. The bylaws of the league
were changed so as to make the president
and the recording secretary active mem
bers of the executive committee. Twelve
new members were proposed and fifteen
elected. After some further routine busi
ness the league adjourned.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with

A MEETING THAT WILL MEET
â  â â .
STATE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
GATHERS TO-DAY.
Â«
But the Heeney Appeal Will Proba
bly Go Over â Another
Primary Election
Plan. .
The local Democracy awaits with cu
rious interest the meeting to-day of the
executive committee of the State Central
Committee, which has been called by
Chairman Seth Mann to consider the
"Heeney appeal," involving the party le
gality of the committee of one hundred.
It does not appear likely that anything
much will be done to-day to disturb the
interesting situation. It Is a little too
early foi drastic measures and most of
the forces at work at this uncertain pe
riod are playing for time. It is thought
likely that the executive committee will
not do more than take some perfunctory
action about the $400) debt of the State
Central Committee and quietly postpone
the Heeney appeal once more..
Mayor Pheian has been making espe
cially strenuous efforts to secure a put
ting off of the row. He is now in Los
Angeles and is expected back Sunday.
Yesterday Colonel Sullivan, his secretary.
saw Chairman Mann and in behalf of
Mr. Pheian suggested and asked a post
ponement of the meeting. It is under
stood that later in 'Jie day a telegram
to the same effect came to Mr. Mann
from Mr. Pheian. and that Mr. Mann's
decision was that as the meeting had
been called it should not be postponed.
The committee might postpone action or
do anything It saw fit to do. Because
of Mayor Phelan's efforts and for other
reasons It is not likely that any impor
tant action will be taken to-day.
As the main reason *.nd motive for the
awakening of the factional row which
this Heeney appeal now causes was the
matter at appointing delegates under the
new primary law, this question still re
mains a leading one. It may be of great
significance whether delegates to the mu
nicipal convention are voted for at large
or by districts or precincts, and about
this question the party powers are spar
ring in an uncertain way.
The latest proposition is a new one put
forward by Max Popper. This is that
delegations to the municipal convention
shall be elected by primary election pre
cincts. Mr. Popper argues that this plan
is the most truly representative and
brings the convention "closest to the peo
ple." It will make a Dig difference in the
membership and boss control of the con
vention whether convention delegates are
elected by precincts, by Assembly district
or by the city at large. This is In the
jurisdiction of the recognized governing
organization, which Is the Committee of
One Hundred, and the latitude for maneu
vering and rowing is evident to those who
are politically wise. The postponement of
the Issue will evidence the great efforts
to secure "harmony" that ls not.

Paul Egry Missing.
When the case of Paul Egry, the well-
known violinist, charged with misde
meanor embezzlement for obtaining and
pawning a violin from Zeno Mauvais &
Co.. was called In Judge Graham's court
yesterday Egry failed to appear and the
Judge issued a" bench warrant for his ar
rest. Attorney McGregor, who appeared
for Egry, said he was on a drunk in San
Jose and would be present in court this
morning.
TTEDEMANN-S BODY.
It Will Be Exhumed, Coroner Hill
Notwithstanding.
Coroner Hill appeared in Judge j
Murasky's court yesterday as his own j
lawyer to defend himself against the ac- |
cusation that he has acted strangely in
the disposition of the body of the late :
William Tiedemann, who died at the Pres- |
cott House two weeks ago, but the Coro
ner failed to clear himself of the charge.
When Judge Murasky called the case he
asked the friends of the dead man to step
to the bar, whereupon a number of men
who were seated in the court came for
ward and stated that they had known the
deceased for some time, in fact a number
of years. These friends wanted to know
whether or not the body had been decent
ly burled, and the Coroner stated that it ;
had. A. Puef, who represented the Public
Administrator, said that the statement of
the Coroner was doubtless correct, but
still as some of the dead man's friends did
not know whether or not a coffin full of
stones had been buried and the body sold
to a medical college, they wanted the body
exhumed. The insinuation that a coffin
full of stones had been burled in place of |
the body of the mourned Tiedemann made ;
Coroner Hill wild, but his anger had no
effect, Judge Murasky suddenly shut the
controversy off by authorizing the friends
of the deceased to apply to the Board of
Health for an order to exhume the body,
and .Undertaker Metzler will bury it as j
was 'flrst desired by the many friends of i
the deceased. i
HE LECTURED ON "THE
AWAKENING OF MEXICO"
' SOCIALISTS ADDRESSED BY DA
VID STARR JORDAN.
:
He Praised President Diaz and Pro
phesied a Bright Future for Our
Sister Republic.
Professor David Starr Jordan of Stan- j
! ford University, at Socialist Hall last
' evening, gave to the Liberty Branch of :
j the Propaganda Club for Socialism the !
! benefit of his personal Impressions and
â  observations of Mexico. Dr. Jordan visit- |
i ed Mexico last winter and spent some lit- |
tle time in traveling through the country. :
When he returned he wrote a lecture upon !
his travels which he calls "The Awaken
ing of Mexico." This lecture he has de
livered before the student body of the I
university oyer which he presides. Last
evening he delivered it before an audience
that fittingly represented the Socialist
Labor party. After he had talked about
i an hour he gave a series of views of
different scenes in Mexico, which were
exceedingly Interesting as well as beau- !
] tiful. These scenes were from pictures ,
that Dr. Jordan took while on his trip,
while others were made from views that
were loaned him.
In substance Dr. Jordan's address was |
simply a history of Mexico from the earli- ;
est time. He explained in detail many of !
the evolutions that have taken place in I
: the country, dealing with Its various
forms of civilization, religion and natural
developments. Regarding the future of
the country Dr. Jordan said that it was
exceedingly bright. He believes Mexico
to be one of the. coming republics and he
gave to President Diaz unstinted praise
for all that he has accomplished. He be
lieves that our relations with Mexico will
grow stronger with each administration,
le said that at present Mexico Is being
peacefully invaded by America, and he
characterized this kind of invasion as the
best and noblest. The lecture was ex
tremely interesting ami at the conclusion
of his remarks Dr. Jordan was warmly
applauded.
PRESIDENT 33 YEARS.
D. J. Staples' Seventy-Fifth Anniver-
sary Celebrated.
David J. Staples, the president of the
Fireman's Fund Insurance Company of
this city, celebrated the seventy-fifth an
niversary of his birth yesterday. He was
born in 1824 in the old commonwealth of
Massachusetts and has been a resident of
California for fifty years, having been
for two years acting president of the So
ciety of Pioneers.
Mr. Staples was a delegate to the Na
tional Republican Convention at Chicago
in 1860 which nominated the great Abra
ham Lincoln, and was la.ter on a port
warden. He has never held any other of
fice, but has always taken a prominent
part In public affairs. Just, thirty-three
years ago to-day he was elected to the
presidency of this time-honored company
and has held the office ever since to the
complete satisfaction of its stockholders.
Mr. Staples has had quite a severe spell
of sickness not long since,, but has almost
entirely recovered from it and ls daily at
tending to the business of the company.
His inner sanctum was converted early
yesterday morning into a veritable bower
of roses by the numerous employes and j
ex-employes of the company over which
he has so long presided.
FOSTER WAS RELEASED.
A New Bond Was Procured and a
Writ of Habeas Corpus Sworn Out. G
Fred Foster, charged with having ob
tained money from his. partner, P. How
ard, under false pretenses, was released
yesterday by Judge Lawlor. upon a bond
of $20,000 being filed, upon which Edward
and John Hackett and William Kent went
as sureties. Next Saturday a writ of
habeas corpus, sworn out on behalf of the
accused, will be heard by Judge Lawlor,
and It will be determined whether or not
Foster is legally held.
When the matter of releasing Foster on
bonds came up a bond was presented to
the court signed by the same sureties
that were finally accepted, but the bond
was fatally defective. It. did not demand
the presence of the defendant in court at
any time and therefore was worthless
as far as Its face was concerned. Ex-
Assistant District Attorney Joe Dunne ex
posed this defect and a new bond was
drawn up. upon which the accused was
released.
Raid on Hackmen.
Several hackmen were arrested yester
day by Sergeant Gorman and Corporal
Bowlen, Hack Inspectors, on warrants
charging them with violating, the hack
ordinance by not having a number on
their hacks or lamps. The hackmen have
been evading the license tax. and the ab
sence of numbers prevents the police and
others from identifying the hacks.

WYOMING TOOK
THE DARKTOWN
DERBY WALKING
Piloted by Col. Mun

â Â« â
RACING DRAWING TO A CLOSE
â â¦â -
FINAL DAY OF THE CALIFOItNIA
JOCKEY CLUB.
Light Crowd in Attendanceâ People
Have Tired of tne Sport â
Favorites in Front â
mus a Good One.
The California Jockey Club brought its
long season of racing to a close at Oak
land track yesterday, with the Darktown
Derby as the feature extraordinary. It
was tbe last on the programme, and was
made the occasion for quite a demonstra
tion. When post time arrived Homeier's
bandâ playing ragtime musicâ headed the
field of starters past the band, with
Felix Carr marching at its head, dressed
in his best and stepping off a cake walk.
Assisted by James Bluegrass Ferguson,
Carr also operated the starting: gate.
Wyoming, the mount of Colonel Munroe
Johnson, was a 6 to 1 favorite, and won
without effort from Durward.
The attendance plainly betokened the
fact that people are tiring of the game,
nnd there was little plunging indulged in.
Four choices led their fields over the
finishing line.
Dr. Etowell's filly Elizabeth R was sent
to the post an odds on choice for the
opening seven furlong run, with Mc-
Nlchols on her back. After running up
in fourth position to the bend for home,
she was bumped and fell out of it.
Festoso, a 6 to 1 chance, led throughout,
winning in a gallop from Nllgar, a 20 to
1 shot.
The Lassen stable's mare Sly looked
away arid above the best of the eight
starters in the six furlong sprint follow
ing, and the 7 to 10 offered about her was
snapped up. She went out, and racing
Dolore to a standstill downed February
in a drive. Xovia at odds of 15 to "l
finished third.
Oremus, the daughter of Ormonde and
Santa Cruz, showed she had staying
..uaiities as well as speed ln the five fur
long dash for two-year-olds. Backed
from 7 to 5 to 4 to 5, Piggott took her out
in front and made a show Of the field,
winning hands down from Tar Hill in
1:02%. San Toma:*. the Burns & Water
house entry, came from the far rear, tak
ing, the show.
The first mile selling affair proved oil
from the can for Daisy F. Sent out a 6 to
5 chance, Jenkins had only to sit still to
win. Passing Bernardillo and Storm King
at the stretch turn, Carroll's mare
reached the wire nearly four lengths In
advance of the former horse, hard held.
The mile Belling run, next decide.!, saw
the red hot favorite Opponent beaten out
a head by Widow Jones. Johnny Reiff
rode the latter, and in a hard drive was
first past the judges by a very narrow
margin.
Track Notes.
Thomas H. Williams Jr. left for Chicago
last evening*. E. C. Hopper, associate
judge in the stand at Oakland, also de
parted for Latonla in the same train.
The ride of McNlchols on Elizabeth R
â was carefully looked Into by the stand,
but passed over without any action being
taken.
Lester Reiff and Henry Shields were
reinstated by the stewards of Oakland
track yesterday.
Thomas Welch, formerly a rider of con
siderable repute, died at the City and
County Hospital in Oakland yesterday of
stomach trouble. The boy was once in
the employ of Mat Byrnes. Like many of
his profession, he was penniless, and Jim
_S".-il busied himself yesterday taking up
a collection to see that the body was
given a decent burial.
Somebody framed tip a good joke on
Bob Freeman, the rider of Texarkana.
Previous to the race Bob was handed a
$50 show ticket on his mount and the way
the colored rider aroused himself to cash
the ticket was -, caution. He landed,
though, and scarcely stopped to take the
colors off before he was out in the bet
ting- ring. Presenting the ticket at a book
he was told to "go away, bo." It was a
"phony." The last seen of Freeman he
was sharpening a big razor on a borrowed
boot, and there certainly will be some
thing doin* when he meets the enemy.

I the evening service ln the Cen
X tral Methodist Church on Ml
sion street has so Increased sine
thÂ© ministration of the present pastor,
Rev. Charles Edward Locke, that the
church trustees were compelled to
look around for more commodious
quarters. The most suitable place to
bo found ln the vicinity of the church
was that at the Metropolitan Temp
on Fifth street. Heretofore it was no
uncommon occurrence to And worship
ers crowding into the sacred edifice at
"the hour of 6:30 on Sunday evening for the purpose of securing seats -within
the building. In order to try as an experiment the holding of the evening
services In a more capacious building, the trustees of the church have secured
Metropolitan Temple on Fifth street for this purpose.
The services under these arrangements will commence next Sunday
evening at 7:45 o'clock and will continue for the balance of the present
month. This period has been given by the Fire Wardens as a compliment
to the Central Church folks, after which the owner of the temple will be
"compelled to make better facilities for the public to enter and leave the build
ing in case of Are or other danger. After the alterations have been made It
ls probable that the evening services will continue to be held in the temple
right along, as Dr. Locke, while not a sensational preacher in any sense of the
â word, is still a man of "up-to-date" ideas, full of magnetism and an eloquent
speaker who holds his hearers close to himself and the subject on which he
discourses.

Major Matthews Discovered That
George Godley of the First Col
orado Regiment Was In
fected With It*
On Monday there were sent to the hos
pital at the Presidio forty-seven soldiers
who had returned on the transport Sher
man. 'ii- of these. Private George God
ley, Company G, First Colorado Regi
ment, was apparently suffering with dy
sentery. On Monday afternoon Godley,
with twelve other soldiers, was placed in
one of th** wards with two hospital stew
ards to attend to them. Tuesday Major
Matthews examined the man and found
that he had symptoms of smallpox. He
Immediately had him placed In an iso
lated tent and a guard placed over him,
SHERMAN BEING TOWED BACK TO QUARANTINE,
while the other men and the two stew
ard:- were confined to the ward and not
allowed to communicate with any one.
Major .Matthews at once notified Chief
Surgeon Forwood of this department,
Who gave him orders to ' 1 mediately com
municate with the Federal authorities.
This he did. an ' yesterday morning God
ley and the twelve soldiers who were in
the same ward with him and also the
two hospital stewards were taken
to Angel Island, where they are now in
quarantine. Major Matthews took the
precautions yesterday to have the ward
In which the men we're iced thoroughly'
disinfected and fumigated, and he also
had the tent in which Godley was con
fined burned. The other thirty-three sol
diers, who were indirectly exposed to the
disease in that they 1 ame over on the
Sherman, are at present confined in a
â¢ward to themselves. No one is allowed
to communicate with them and there is
a guard to prevent the men from getting
out. Major Matthews does not anticipate
a spread of the disease, but he cannot
say at present what the results may be.
The Sherman has been ordered back into
quarantine by Quarantine Officer Brooks.
Major Matthews thinks that the men
were discharged from the Sherman he

4jets flat on his back, unable to do a stroke
of work. He becomes obliged to spend no
end of money for doctors and even at that
can hardly save his life.
How much more sensible, and in the end
how much cheaper at the first 6igns of phy-
sical weakness to write to Dr. R. V. Pierce,
chief consulting physician of the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute, of Buffalo,

In quarantine. He declared that danger
threatens the city and will continue to
threaten It unless the greatest care is
taken in thoroughly fumigating the
transports that are to bring back the sol
diers from the Philippines. He believes
that the vessels should be disinfected and
fumigated both here and at Manila.
There Is risk, he says, in bringing sol
diers from the Philippines, for the reason
that the men may go aboard ship in
fected with the disease, which breaks out
after the transport is at sea. The ques
tion whether or not smallpox can be kept
out of this country with the return of
the soldiers is a serious one. Major Mat
thews does not hesitate to say that some
one is to blame for the Sherman being
allowed to leave her quarantine BO soon.
The Sherman was taken back Into quar
antine yesterday afternoon. During the
voyage from Manila a case of smallpox ;
aeveiopea, but the patient was left at I
Nagasaki, and as there was **>) more sick
ness during the run to San Francisco the
vessel was held in Quarantine only atÂ«w !
hours. All the members of the crew and
steerage passengers were vaccinated,
after which Quarantine Office Brooks
gave the vessel pratique.
The Sherman's cabin passengers were
landed last Sunday and the vessel docked
Monday morning. As soon as she was
alongside the wharf the sick soldiers were
landed and sent out to the Presidio. The
members of the crew were then given
shore leave, and they made every use
of their opportunities. Tuesday afternoon j
when the case developed word was at
once telephoned to the Government dock
and the transports Sherman and Cen
tennial were placed in quarantine. Patrol
wagons were sent out and the services of
the harbor police invoked, with the re
sult that nearly every member of the two
crews was rounded up and put back
aboard the transports.
During the early hours of the morning
the news reached the Board of Health,
and State Quarantine Officer Chalmers and
Health Officer O'Brien at once went down
!to the transports. They made a careful
examination of every than on the Sher
man and Centennial and vaccinated some
of the men on the latter who had been i
overlooked by Dr. Brooks. Some of the
men were Buffering from various causes.
but not one of them showed a trace of
smallpox. Half an hour after they left
the transports the orders arrived from
the United States Marine Hospital and
the Sherman was taken in tow by the
tugs Relief and Fearless and towed over
to Angel Island, where she Joined the
Grant in quarantine.
A gang of 150 men was to have pone to
work on the Sherman yesterday morning,
and then the vessel was to have been tak
en to the Hunters Point drydock, where
she was to have been thoroughly over
hauled, cleaned, and painted. A number
of painters and riggers were aboard the
vessel when the orders came to place her
in quarantine and they will have to re
main aboard until the ship is released.
The Centennial will not be held In
quarantine but will take the Sherman's
place on Hunters Point drydock to-day,
and will be got ready as quickly as pos
sible to start again for Manila.
TO STAY IN QUARANTINE.
Board of Health Will Not Per
mit Dockage for Sixteen
Days.
The members of the San Francisco
Board of Health held a special meeting
last night.
The meeting was attended by Dr. Wil
liamson, Dr. Fltzgibbon, Dr. Baum, Dr.
A. P. O'Brien, the Health Officer, and
Dr. Chalmers, the Quarantine Officer. It
was determined to make a decided stand
to prevent the introduction of infectious
diseases in the ships coming from orien
tal ports. The first step was to order the
transport Sherman detained in quaran
tine sixteen days to await the develop
ment of new cases .vhich may be in
course of incubation.
The discussion was opened by Dr.
O'Brien, who told of the occurrences of
the day. He was informed by Dr. Chal
mers of the rumors regarding smallpox
on the transports Centennial and Sher
man and together they investigated tie
matter. They went first to the Centen
nial and after a thorough examination
determined there was no reason why she
should not dock. No illness had devel
oped during the past twenty-four days.
The master of the ship presented an af
fidavit covering the period since he en
tered the port. The affidavit developed a
remarkable laxness in the methods pur
sued by Dr. Brooks, the Federal Quaran
tine Officer. It recited that the latter had
boarded the vessel upon her arrival. He
could not vaccinate all the crew, as he
did not have sufficient vaccine points.
Notwithstanding this he gave a clear bill
of health and the vessel docked. Twenty
six hours afterward he sent an assistant
who completed the work.
Drs. O'Brien and Chalmers next went
to the Sherman. They could find no
evidence of contagious disease, but
heard, accidentally, that a case of small
pox had developed at the Presidio after
the patient had left, the ship. A visit was
paid army headquarters, Pheian building,
where they learned from Dr. Forward,
deputy surgeon general, of a case found
in a passenger on the Sherman. He said
the sufferer and fourteen men, who were
exposed to the disease, had been re
moved to Angel Island, where they could
be readily isolated. Recognizing the
gravity of the situation, the medical de
partment. United States army, imme
diately ordered the Sherman back to the
quarantine station. Dr. O'Brien asked
the members of the board to fix the time
at which they would allow the vessel to
be docked.
Dr. Fltzgibbon at once moved that the
Sherman be detained sixteen days in
quarantine and that she be fumigated
under the direction of representatives of
the Board of Health. He thought a
grave responsibility rested upon the
board to protect the people of this city
from contagion. In keening with this
Idea it was determined to order Dr
Chalmers, representing the board, to
prevent, by legal or forcible methods, the
dockage of any vessel without letters of
pratique. These permit the landing of
crew and passengers.
Secretary Dunne was instructed to
communicate with the members of the
State Board of Health asking for a con
ference between the two boards at once.

A FIGHT IN
PROSPECT OVER
A SHIP'S CREW
Men Sent North Under
a Strong Guard.
â â¦â â
FOR THE HOWARD D. TROOP
â â¦ â
BOARDING MASTERS ARE ON
THE SAILORS' TRAIL.
Â»
All Parties to the Anticipated Mix-
Up Sailed Together on the
Steamer Columbia for
Portland Yesterday.
There will be lively times and maybe
a shooting scrape on the steamer Colum- '
bia before she lands her passengers at '
Astoria to-day. "When the vessel left here I
yesterday morning for the Columbia Riv- '
er she had fourteen men for the British
ship Howard D. Troop in the steerage.
Accompanying the sailors were two
watchmen, armed to the teeth, while in
another part of the ship are two hoarding
masters who have taken an oath to pre
vent the Troop or any other deep-water ,
ship getting a crew except on the terms
imposed by the Boarding Masters' Asso- j
elation of Portland. These two men are
equally as well armed as the watchmen,
and there is sure to he a ciash when the
attempt ls made to put the sailors aboard
the Troop at Astoria.
The trouble began on February 20 last
when the new law passed ir- Congress
went Into effect. Accordin**' to Â.s pro
visions, the captain of any vessel, Amer
ican or foreign, is only allowed to give
one month's advance to a Bailor. Before
the law went into effect the rate In
Oregon for a sailor was $40 'two months'
pay) advance, $10 "olood money" and $5
shipping fee. Almost every cent of this
$55 went Into the nocket of the shipping
master, and wnen Congress cut the sum
down to $20 there was an outcry. The
boarding masters got together and deter
mined to attack the law through the â¢
pockets of the British ship-owners. They
reasoned that if the price of a sailor was
advanced to $100 ("blood money") the
twist to the lion's tail would be more
than he could bear, and that he would do
something to make the United ' States
take it- hands out of his pockets and once
more put It in "poor Jack's."
The boarding masters now assert that
they were correct in their surmise, and
that such pressure will be brought to
bear on Congress by the British ship
owners that next November or December
will see the law repealed. Whether the
boarding masters will win their point and
the way they say remains to be seem.
One thing is certain â they are a power
In Portland politics. At the last Session
' of the Oregon Legislature a bill to abol
ish "blood money" was introduced, but
; It was pigeon-holed through the Influence
of the water front, so 'tis said.
When the new law went into effect the
â¢ boarding masters held a consultation, and
! then Issued their ultimatum. They re
; fused to accept an advance in any shape or
; form. They controlled the supply of sail
i ors and told the captains that men would
be supplied their vessels at a uniform rate
of $100 per man. Then the row began.
The captain of the British ship Balmoral
was ready for sea and wanted a crew.
He laughed at the idea of $100 "blood
money,' but the boarding masters only
remarked "He laughs best who laughs
last." Not a man could be got for the
Balmoral, and in despair the captain
wrote to San Francisco.
In port here and lying at the seawall is
the British ship Dunstaffnage. She and the
Balmoral belong to the same owners, and
to Captain Forbes of the Dunstaffnage
i Captain Campbell of the Balmoral made
j his appeal. Now the Dunstaffnage only
j arrived from Calcutta a short time ago
I and nearly all the crew was by her. Cap-
I tain Forbes at once took them before the
| British Consul and paid them off. He
! then shipped them on the Balmoral, each
man getting a "gift" over and above his
! pay. The men were shipped to Portland
| on the State of California in charge of a
. watchman, but the boarding master's rep
resentative also went along, and the result
was that the men from the Dunstaffnage
refused point blank to go aboard the
I Balmoral. They made all kinds of ex-
I cuses, and finally in despair Captain
Campbell paid $50 apiece for the privilege
| of keeping his own men.
Then came the Howard D. Troop, the
source of the present trouble. The cap
tain wanted thirteen men and a cook and
the boarding masters asked $1400 "blood
money" for them. Captain Corning of
fered $ s 5 a man with "a piece back, and
I the boarding masters promptly replied by
j raising the "blood money" to $112 a man.
> Then Captain Corning sent his mate and
I an agent to San Francisco to gather up
! a crew, but the boarding masters followed
the sailors from San Francisco to Astoria
! took them off the steamer, in spite of
Captain Coming's protests, and shipped
i them on another vessel, getting $100
; "blood money" for each man.
Now comes the tug of war. Captain
I Corning wrote and laid his case before
< Balfour, Guthrie & Co. of this city. The
firm is agent for the Troop, and it was
decided to get a crew for her. The job
was intrusted* to Thomas Chandler and
Charles McCarthy and they secured the
menâ eight from the Sailors' Home and
five from Tom Murray. These men were
signed before the British Consul at the
rate of $20 a month, and each man got his
: month's advance and "a gift" of $25 be
i sides.
I The men wore now secured and it be

came a question of getting them to As- .
toria. Tickets to that place were pur- |
chased and two watchmen, named Robin- ;
son and Thomas, hired to look after the !
men. The watchmen get $10 a day while I
they are away and all expenses, and their j
Instructions are to fight at the drop of the
hat. The men were rounded up and put
aboard the steamer Columbia early yes- j
terday morning and are now well on their ]
way to the Columbia River. Yesterday |
afternoon Balfour, Guthrie & Co. paid the
advance notes and the Incident was sup
posed to be closed.
While the men were being shipped the
Boarding Masters' Association was not
Idle, however. Two of its membersâ R.
McCarron and T. Murphyâ were in the
city and knew exactly what was being
done. When they learned that the sailors'
tickets read from "San Francisco to As
toria" they laughed in their sleeve and
took passage on the Columbia, consider
ing the fight as good as won. The How
ard D. Troop has already been detained
nine days waiting for a crew and the
boarding masters say. she will wait nine
more, or until Captain Corning pays $112
"blood money" per man.
What made the boarding masters jubi- ;
lant is this. The sailors who shipped for
the Troop cannot he put ashore except at
Astoria, unless they so elect. The two
men now in the Columbia will see to It
that they are landed at Astoria only. If
necessary each sailor will be given $30 or
$40 to side with the boarding masters.
The men will jump at the offer and then â¢
the fight will begin. When the fight be
tween union and non-union men was most '
bitter some time ago a vessel was tied
up at Eureka for want of a crew. The |
men were secured here and were shipped
on the Pomona, but their tickets only \
read from "San Francisco to the Hum- |
boldt Bar." When the Pomona got there
the union men had got in their work and
the men refused to go into the tug wait
ing to put them aboard the ships. Then
there was almost bloodshed and one
boarding master nearly lost the number
of his mess. Captain Cousins soon settled
the matter, however. He demanded to
see the sailors' tickets, and when he saw !
that their voyage ended at the Hum
boldt Bar he gave them five minutes to
get over the side or else be put ln Irons. j
The sailors boarded the tug and the union I
was outwitted. The men for the Troop
are booked to Astoria, and there Captain ',
Green must land them If they so desire.
The Boarding Masters' Association of i
Portland is one of the most powerful or- j

THRALL'S NEW SCHEME.
Superintendent's Plans for Expedit
ing Mails for the Orient Have
Been Inaugurated.
J. M. Johnson, chief clerk of the rail
way mail service at Los Angeles, has been
detailed to go to Honolulu to take charge
of the transfer of mails at that port for
the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand
and the Orient. By this arrangement the
dispatch of mail matter from this city
! will be expedited by three days. Before
j this change of system was adopted by
, the Postofflce Department It was neces
; sary to send all mail for the Orient to
i Vancouver to be placed on board the
| steamer at that point. Letters may be
j mailed under the new system at " San
Francisco and will be taken to Honolulu
from which point they will be trans
ferred to the steamers arriving from Van
couver. The business public of the State
is indebted to Superintendent Thrall for
the conception and carrying out of the
system. Â.,.â

SCHOOL DIRECTORS DO
NOT APPROVE ADVICE
MAYOR SNOW'S SUGGESTIONS
NOT RELISHED.
Board of Education Says It Is the
Best Judge of How Much Money
to Spend.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 3.
The Board of Education does not. take
kindly to the suggestions of Mayor Snow
made at its last meeting. The Finance
Committee of the hoard has filed a
lengthy report in which it criticizes and
Clearly resents what it considers an inter
ference with its prerogatives by the May
or and City Council. â¢ It plainly states its
view of the situation in the follow. -ing
paragraph:
"The Boards of Education are empow
ered to establish and maintain as many
and such schools as they shall deem ne
cessary and to expend all school funds
and are alone responsible for the success
or failure of the schools establish.',]. The
only duty in regard to schools entrusted
by law to the Mayor and City Council is
the fixing of the percentage of taxes to
be levied and collected each year for
school purposes."
The Mayor has suggested that the
School Board attempt to conduct the
grammar and primary schools for the
next fiscal year upon the income to be de
rived from the State and county taxes
without any supplement from the city
treasury. In this connection the report
says:
"This board therefore should do its
wflole duty and plan for the best schools
and sufficient accommodations and In its
annual estimate notify the City Council
through the City Auditor of the amount
of money required for such purposes or
it will he derelict in its duty.
"Therefore your committee recommends
that the third suggestion of the Mayor be
disregarded."
