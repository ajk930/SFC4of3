VOLUME LXXXT-SO. 109.
LEGISLATIVE WORK WILL GO ON
UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK TO-DAY
SOUTHERN PACIFIC'S
POLITICAL REGIME HAS
BEEN OVERTHROWN
Daniel M. Burns Goes Down to
Oblivion in the Wreck.
But Three Men Dared to Face the Contempt
of the People by Deserting Their
Cause and Voting for the Mexican.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA-]
MENTO, March IS.â The efforts of the
railroad and Burns to finish the Sena- :
torial contest in a midnight session of
the joint convention were defeated to- 1
day in one of the hardest and closest I
battles ever fought in the Legislature
of California. In opposition to the .
scheme the Grant men, aided by the
Democrats and stalwart friends of the
people in the camps of Barnes and
Scott, lined up and won a splendid vic
tory. The result of the day's contest is
the defeat of Burns' aspirations for the
Senatorship and the overthrow of the
political regime of the Southern Pacific
Company in this State.
The chief fight of Dibble, leading the
Burns contingent, was to obtain a re
cess until 4 o'clock in the afternoon and
then at the approach of darkness be
gin the work of manipulation. The Call
this morning apprised the members of
the Legislature of the dangers lurking
uehind a dark session and the good ana "
true men were on their guard.
The first changes to-day were regis
tered on the fourth ballot immediately
after Dibble's motion for a recess had
been defeated. On this ballot Assem
blyman Cosper went from the Scott
camp to Burns and Assemblyman Mar
vin went out of the Grant camp to the
corral of the colonel. Assemblyman
Reserve, a Democrat, voted for Grant,
which enabled the San Diego states
man to hold his own numerically. .
At the close of the seventh ballot
Senator Cutter introduced a resolution
to take twelve ballots and then adjourn
the convention sine die if no choice had
been reached. The resolution was
adopted; ayes 61, noes 57. On the sec
ond ballot of the closing series of
twelve Assemblyman Muenter left the
Barnes camp and voted for Van R.
Paterson. On the next ballot Senator
Taylor joined Muenter in voting for
Paterson. On the ballot following La
Baree left Scott and voted for Pater
son On the tenth ballot of the series
of twelve Assemblyman Miller of Los
Angeles deserted Barnes and went to
Burns. No other changes were record
ed An hour before Miller left the
Barnes camp it was known to Senator
Bulla and Assemblyman Valentine that
he was going and they endeavored to
prevent the change, not that they
feared the result, but they sincerely
desired 'hat Miller should not cloud .lis
future by such a step.
It was frequently mentioned this
evening as a significant fact that the
three staked-out Burns men were
drawn from three separate camps.
Cosper me from Scott's camp. Mar
vin from Grant's and Miller from the
camp of General Barnes. ,â_.Â«.â
Several efforts were made during the
afternoon to reconsider the Cutter res
olution but the Grant men were on
the alert and the Democrats were vigi
lant At the conclusion of the thir
teenth ballot points of order were
raised. Dibble raised the point that
.he adjournment of the joint conven
tion sine die could not be fixed by res
oltUion-asa Federal statute governed
.ne proceedings. Senator Flint Vo pre
siding, sustained Dibble in so far as
the resolution applied to,sine die : ad
journment, but when the final defeat
of the motion to rescind the resolution
was announced he declared the Joint
convention adjourned on the approval
of the Journal of its proceedings.
During the session of six hours, from
noon until 6 o'clock, the air of the con
vention was filled with ugly rumors of
the use and the promise or money to in
fluence the course of legislators. The
Burns followers were thick on the floor
and in the lobby of the Assembly
chamber. They raised a great uproar
in lieu of applause when Cosper and
"Marvin entered the corral. When Mr.
Miller of Los Angeles changed from
General Barnes to Burns there was a
tumultuous uproar. The noise did not
alarm any one as no signs of a stam
pede were observed. Men reflected
what a night session would be if legis
lators were in joint convention voting
â for a Senator. The thoughts of many
reverted to Moses when the lights went
The Senatorial candidates to-night
have but little to say. General Barnes
said he was glad the contest was over
and that he was satisfied with the re
sult. U. S. Grant had nothing to say
on the subject beyond remarking that
he would not be called upon to wear
the Senatorial toga. Irving M. Scott
went out of the fight with four votes,
two more than he had when he went
in. General Barnes had eighteen sup
porters when the last ballot was taken.
A new element of danger was sus
pected to-night when Dibble's resolu
tion was adopted to extend the Legis
lative session until 11 a. m. to-morrow.
Assurance was given to the Assembly
that no effort would be made to take
another ballot for Senator. When Dib
ble gave that assurance Caminettl
asked if he spoke for the Republican
majority, and the Republicans were
appealed to if any one questioned Dib- '
ble's right to speak for the majority. I

There was no dissent, and all the mem
bers accepted the assurance. It is the
judgment almost unanimous of the
Legislature that not another ballot will
be taken for Senator.
Dibble says he asked Colonel Burns
if the fight was finished, and the lat
ter remarked: "Absolutely finished."

LEGISLATORS READY
TO BLOCK A TRICK
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, March 18.â There is much
comment here to-night over the action of the Legislature in prolonging,
by joint resolution, the session until 11 o'clock to-morrow morning. It is
asserted by some that this action will necessitate the taking of an
other ballot for Senator. The constitution provides that the joint as
sembly shall meet at noon on each legislative day and take at least one
ballot for United States Senator. To-morrow having been made a legis
lative day by virtue of the joint resolution adopted this evening, it be
comes a question as to whether or not it will not be necessary to comply
with the constitution in spite of the fact that final adjournment has
been fixed for a time one hour prior to the noon hour. If this desire
to extend the time of final adjournment proves to be a trick on the
part of the Burns men to secure for themselves another opportunity to
ballot for Senator, it is not likely that the honest men in the Legis
lature will permit the promoters of the scheme to reap a profit
from their sharp practice.
Dibble asked if he could assure the
Assembly that no more ballotir/g would
ensue if the session was extended un
til 11 a. m. to-morrow, if he could
pledge his word of honor to that ef
fect. Burns replied that he could, so
far as his men were concerned.
There are some members who have
an apprehension that something not
anticipated may happen to-morrow. ;
Senator Davis is confident ; that not
another ballot will be taken, and he |
says to-night that he does not know of
a single Senator who believes that an
other ballot will be taken. Speaker An
derson declares that he will declare the
Assembly adjourned sine die at 11 a. m.
to-morrow.
The point is discussed to-night
whether the way will not be opened
for the* Governor to make an appoint
ment of United States Senator that
will be recognized as valid if the
Legislature fails to ballot to-morrow.
The contention is advanced that the
\ Legislature, failing to ballot, would
fail to obey the Federal statute, and
therefore the Governor could ap
| point.
TIME EXTENDED FOR
FINAL ADJOURNMENT
FOR ELEVEN HOURS
Like Drowning Men the Burns Con
tingent Grasps at Straws.
Dibble Gives Personal Promise That No Fur
ther Extension of Grace Will Be Asked
When the Period Specified Elapses.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 18. "The Senatorial
contest of this session is over. For
myself, I will promise that when 11
o'clock comes to-morrow morning I
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
1 shall not consent to any further ex
tension of time."
Mr. Dibble was speaking to a resolu
i tion he introduced when this evening's
session began, overriding Belshaw's
resolution fixing 12 o'clock to-night a3
the hour of adjournment side die, and
fixing 11 o'clock a. m. to-morrow as
the hour. \-
Incidentally Mr. Dibble was also an
swering some rather pointed questions
asked of him by Mr. "Works of San
Diego and . Mr. Caminetti of Amador
and the minority.
It was precisely the resolution that
the opposition to Burns expected would
be sprung when the Mexican's beaten
forces went downcast out of the As
sembly chamber this afternoon.
President pro tern. Flint ruled this
afternoon that should the Legislature
extend over another legislative day the
adjournment sine die of the joint ballot
would be annulled. The yell of triumph
that went up from the Burns gang
when the decision was announced was
evidence enough that the next play
would be a fight for extension.
Dibble began to-night's proceedings
with the expected resolution. It read
as follows:
"Assembly Concurrent Resolution No.
Resolved, By the Assembly, the Sen
ate concurring, that the time for ad
journment sine die by this Legislature
be extended until Sunday, March 19,
1899, at 11 o'clock a. m."
It was adopted by a vote of 41 to 20.
In offering his resolution Mr. Dibble
said that it was for the one sole pur
pose of passing fifty-eight Senate bills
remaining on the Assembly file, some
of which were of importance and should
become laws. He argued that to-night
there would not be time to complete the
work, but that there would be if his
resolution were adopted.
Mr. Works attempted to get recogni
tion but Mr. Conrey came up with a
point of order. He suggested that the
new resolution could not be considered
until the vote by which the original
resolution was passed had been recon
sidered.
Speaker Anderson declared the point
not well taken and then Mr. Works got
pertinent. He remarked that he real
ized the necessity of more time for the
reconsideration of bills but did not see
the necessity of further balloting upon
the Senatorial question. "We have
amply demonstrated this afternoon,"
said he, "that we ' can elect no man
Senator. I will support this resolution
upon the understanding with the gen
tleman from San Francisco that when
11 o'clock comes to-morrow we shall
adjourn and that no attempt shall be
made to get an extension beyond that
hour."
The "gentleman from San Francisco"
vouchsafed no such promise, and Val
entine of Los Angeles got up to demand
another reading of the resolution.
Then Mr. Caminetti took a hand. "I
will support this resolution," said he,
"If the leaders of the Republicans will
give us assurance that when the hour
comes we shall adjourn. I think It
right that if the majority will not agree
to this its representatives say so now.".
"I will say. as I have said before,"
said Mr. Dibble, "that the Senatorial
contest of this session is over. For
myself, I will promise that when 11
o'clock comes to-morrow morning I
shall not consent to any further ex
tension of time."
"Do you speak for yourself alone or
for the Republican majority?" pointedly
asked Caminetti.
"I think." retorted Dibble, "that by
this time I have the right to speak for
the Republicans of this House."
It was an equivocal answer, and it
was significant that not one in the
House save Dibble concurred in his own
agreement.
It apparently was satisfactory to the
opposition, arid by the subsequent vote
the Assembly decided to take the
chance. The resolution was at once
sent to the Senate.
The resolution caused some debate
in the Assembly, but when it came to
the Senate all the bitterness of beaten
ambition was called up and it lent to
the words of the speakers a venom that
was startling. "Coward,* "hireling,"
"tool," every term to express political
slavery and degradation, was turned
back and forth across the chamber,
regardless of the president's active
gavel and the sergeants at arms, and
the ceiling shook with the shouts and
yells of the rooters and heelers and
touts, who were there to whoop for
every trick the Burns faction turned.
And it even got so far as a hissâ
distinct hissâ when, after a volcanic
speech by Shortridge, Davis, white with
anger and his eyes a-glitter, rose to
reply to some of the epithets which had
been applied to him. _/_â¢'â '_â .
Points of order, questions, objections,
every dodge known to the skilled par
liamentarian, were heaped one upon
the other to keep the Amador man from2

height of injustice, that Davis flna.lj
Sad his say. It will be long before the
Senate walls will again echo such an
3. d dross. _
The resolution came before the Sen
ate as an Assembly message. On mo
tion' of Dickinson It was taken up un
der a motion to suspend the rules and
adopt the measure at once. It pro
vided that the Legislature when it ad
journed to-night should do so only un
til to-morrow, and that it should ad- >
journ sine die at 11 o'clock to-morrow
morning. ,
Instantly a trio of Senators rose and .
claimed the floor, and Lieutenant Gov
ernor Neff, who was presiding, recog- j
nized Wolfe. â  . â¢-* v.; y- ; 7-' yy
â  Wolfe had a substitute which pro- |
vided that the hour of the final ad- j
journment of the Legislature should be
at noon on Wednesday, March 22, ail
resolutions in conflict notwithstanding.
It was the claw in the paw and it
needed no words from Wolfe to show I
the sharpness of it. Wolfe opined that
there was something important to be
considered or such a resolution as had ;
come from the Assembly would never
have passed that body, and he thought
this was something of sufficient impor
tance to carry the session on for two
or three days longer. And then the
Burns faith and honor and capacity for
fairness and open dealing was paraded
before the Senate and the crowds which
thronged its lobbies.
Despite the action of the joint As- |
sembly and the repeated votes, which
with sledge-hammer force drove home
the fact that the power of Burns was
a punctured bubble, Wolfe went on to
declare that it was for the taking of
further joint ballots that he wanted the
extra time. It was such a narrow vote
that had defeated them, he said, and he
thought it was "but fair." t was their
duty, he said, they owed to "their party,
and he asked that his substitute be
adopted.
Simpson added his word to Wolfe's,
and then Dickinson made an explana
tion of the measure.
Dickinson explained that the resolu
tion was for the purpose of allowing
consideration of bills and was not for
the purpose of another joint ballot. The
Senatorial question did not enter into
the matter at all. It was for the pur
pose of transacting business, he said,
and for no other purpose. So far as he
was concerned, he said, the Senatorial
question had ended to-day. His re
marks were directed entirely to the
resolution as it came from the Assem
bly. He then went on to say that there
would be no request for an extension
of the time and he called upon any one
who would move for an extension of the
time, and none arising he declared the
Senators pledged on their honor to
make no such demand.
Davis referred to the pledge and said
if it was understood it was upon the
honor of the Senators that no one i
would rise to-morrow and ask to ex
tend the time beyond the true 11 o'clock
without putting the clock back, he was
willing to entertain the resolution. He
also asked a pledge from the Senate j
and no one rose to say he would move
to have the time extended.
Shortridge took up the discussion at
this point and grew eloquent over the
spectacle which he conjured up for
himself of the Republican party
"bound hand and foot and in its cof
fin."
So long as the Senator from the
mountain tops had a few paltry bills,
he said, he was willing to bury his j
party by 11 o'clock in the morning.
He referred to his efforts to secure
a caucus, to get the Republicans to
gether and select some one to repre
sent the State and to the refusal of
the other factions to follow his exam
ple. He referred in slighting terms to
Davis and to the position he said Da
vis had assumed, for he insinuated that
Davis had affiliated himself with the i
Democrats and the enemies of Burns, j
to betray the Republican party. He |
spoke of cowards who feared to go into
a caucus, and of traitors who would be
tray, to everything a politician thinks
is bad and calculated to injure an en
emy. :;'
Davis demanded the floor as Short
ridge ceased. Bettman raised the point
of order that Davis had spoken once on
the question and could not speak again.
The point was declared well taken.
Then Davis demanded a question of
personal privilege and Leavitt raised
another point to the effect that such a
question was only in order after the
vote, and Davis was silenced until after
the question and could not speak again.
Smith favored the resolution, not the
substitute, but he objected to binding
himself with a pledge. He said he
would do as he saw fit, and if all the
candidates now running for the United
States Senate would withdraw he
would be willing to continue the
session, but with the present candidates
In the field was sure further balloting
would be useless.
Davis again demanded the floor, and
after sweeping aside several points of
order, he was allowed to speak to a
question of personal privilege. He took
up the charge of cowardice first and
compared himself and his colleagues
voting in the open to the men who
could not change their vote on a mo
tion to take up a bill until a messenger
had come up the aisle and whispered in
their ears; who, when they* wanted to
speak and were told to sit down, would
sit down without question. No man, he
said, could intimidate or buy or cajole
him. VM/*
"I have been grossly insulted." he
cried. "It ill becomes any one to say
to me or to those who have remained
loyal to such men as we have voted
for that we are 'cowards' and 'trim
mers.' We cannot.be put in the posi
tion where any one can say the railroad
had crammed. Dan Burns down our
throats. . If we go back to our homes
without a Senator we can say that
Grant and Barnes and Scott have kept
the State from having a man whom the
State said she would not have. I have .
nothing to say of the personal charac
ter of D. M. Burns, but he is not the
choice of the people of this State, but
the Senators know we can all go home
and say to the Republican party that
we have done our duty honorably and
honestly, unbought, uncajoled and un
lntimidated."
For twenty minutes he poured a tor
rent of verbal vitriol over -the Burns
camp and sat down only when his voice
began to fail.
Boyce took the floor with another
roast for the plan to hold over, de
nouncing it as a subterfuge to evade
the first resolution passed in good faith
last week. , ..-" ' _ *_
Then Senator Morehouse got a hold.
He agreed to the Assembly resolution
and to the pledge referred to by Davis,
SSfhe did not want Wolfe's substitute.
He believed that if they adopted the
resolution it should be done without
injecting the Senatorial question into
thai of adjournment, v....;
Wolfe explained in answer to the
criticisms on his substitute that he in
troduced it at the order of no man.
He did it, he said, because he believed
the Republicans should use every ef
fort to elect a Senator. He said it was
not long since Burns was recognized as
the head of the Republican party in
this State, and he would still be the
Jeader had it not been for the. press.
Wolfe then referred to his attitude re
garding the other candidates, and he
begged that the followers of Burns
would not be charged with being driven
because of their loyalty to the man of
their choice.
He said he knew his substitute would
be beaten because the Senator from
Amador had the solid Democratic vote
of the Senate at his back. He said ln
couclusic-n that he would withdraw
the substitute, and when he did so the
Senatorial contest was over for him.
"Boyce wanted a question of personal
privilege to say he had never looked
upon Burns as the head of the Repub
lican party in California and he was al
lowed to speak, despite several points
of order raised to stop him. Boyce said
Burns had never been the leader and
had he been so he would have been Sen
ator to-day. He was deposed by his
own acts and methods.
Then Dickinson moved for a call of
the roll and the Assembly resolution
was adopted by this vote:
Ayes: Ashe, Bettman, Boyce, Braun
hart, Bulla, Burnett, Chapman, Currier,
Curtin. Cutter, Davis, Dickinson. Doty,

Senate Amendment and
Passed the Bill.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- i
MENTO, March To-night the Assem- :
bly concurred in the amendment added by J
the Senate to the Pacific and Interna
tional Exposition bill. The amendment |
cuts the appropriation rom $500,000 to $250,- j

rains, the committee so earnestly engaged '
in working the gigantic scheme up de- j
clares itself highly satisfied. Charles L.

military bill providing for the partial re

Only an hour or so of the morning was j
given over to routine work, and that hour ;
was pleasantly interrupted by the eccen
tric caperings of W. C. Coward, an ex-
San Francisco real estate operator.
Coward came into the chamber and
took a seat near Grove L. Johnson. Grove
trembled . and reached for his boot, but '
didn't find what he was after. * Then ..e I
lumped to his feet and frantically de- >
manded from the Speaker protection from \
the man at his side.
In tear-dewed tremulous tones he ex- i
plained that Coward had been sending
threatening messages to members of the
Assembly for some days past; that he
was crazy and dangerous when he had his :
fits.
Coward sprang to his feet and opened
a wild harangue that rivaled the best
efforts of Assemblyman Kenneally when ,

SENATE TRIED TO DO
A BIG DAY'S WORK
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March IS.â The Senate started
out this morning with every intention of
doing a big day's work, and one of the
first steps toward such an end was More
house's half-forgotten resolution refusing
the privileges of the floor to any but
legislators, their personally invited
friends and the representatives of the
press. The resolution was adopted and
the floor was partially cleared of visitors,
but that did not help matters particularly
so far as order was concerned, for Sen
ators were running over the floor all the
morning trading for" votes in the interest
of their own measures.
Rickard's Assembly bill relating to box
ing contests was passed. The bill is to
prohibit boxing contests except those for
a limited number of rounds which are
held under the auspices of some regular
ly incorporated club, which must pay a
yearly license for the privilege of holding
such exhibitions. The bill further pro-
vides that the clubs must have a physi
cian in attendance at every ring contest.
Assemblyman Mead's bill, making the
expense of giving a bond by administrat
ors, executors, trustees, receivers and as
signees an expense payable as an expense
of administration, was lost after much
more discussion than the time warranted.
Further time was consumed in a motion
to suspend the rules and reconsider the
losing vote, but this, too, failed.
In the evening, when the Senators came
back from the joint ballot, the tax levy
Assembly bill 1015â was taken up un
der an urgency resolution introduced by
Stratton, was read the second and third
times and passed, and all within ten min
utes. When the Senate convened in the
evening matters legislative were at fever
heat, and as soon as the Senate was
called to ! order Senator Curtin opened
matters by asking leave to introduce an
urgency resolution under which he could
put through a measure as corrected sub
stitute for his bill relating to the salaries
of Superior Judges in Tuolumne County, a
bill which the Governor vetoed last night
for an error in the title. Leavitt was mad
over something and refused to allow
unanimous consent, so the bill was put
through on rollcall.
It was difficult to start proceedings, for
as the Senatorial fight was considered
practically over the Senators did not feel
called upon to show that overflow of cour
tesy which has been their wont. Besides,
it had been a hard afternoon and the leg
islators were tired and irritable.
They were in that state when the free ,
market bill bobbed up under Assembly
messages as blithely as if it had never
been amended to pieces twice and had
been gathered together again when every
one thought it should finally stay dead.
This time, however, it found its finish, for
the Senate refused to concur in the
amendment the Assembly had tacked on
to it, and so the bill ended its race. Dur
ing the discussion Senator Stratton took
occasion to say that the claim that the
bill was hi the interest of the farmers was
a fake, -or of 1500 letters sent out over
the State to ascertain the feeling regard
ing the establishment of a free market on
the water front of San Francisco but
eleven answers favoring it were received.
He asked, too, how long was it since
Kelly, Rainey and Wright of the railroad
started to work for the farmers. He
said the bill was a railroad measure and
predicted the defeat that overtook it.
THE SESSION CLOSED .
IN A LOVE FEAST
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 18.â The valedictory to
this the thirty-third session of the Legis
lature was said . in the Assembly this
evening.
The bills, the politics, the fights and
all the things that go .to render each suc
ceeding session more famous than the
last were all cast up i and to the Speaker
and the leaders on the floor was paid
great tribute.
To Speaker Anderson was presented as
handsome a silver service as money could
purchase. Mr. Works made the presenta
tion speech; to Judge Dibble and , his
splendid executive ability as leader and
legislator the encomiums of all the mem
bers on the floor of no matter what creed
were directed; to Grove L. Johnson was
the same meed of friendship and praise.
Major Kyle, chief clerk, and all of the
officers of the Assembly, not forgetting
Sergeant at Arms William Banks, were
presented with appropriate tokens of the
esteem in which they are held. There was
some: mighty spellbinding and good fel
lowship ran riot all through the chamber.
It was the usual close to the biennial ses
sftm.
EX-SENATOR WHITE ON
POLITICAL CONDITIONS
LOS ANGELES, March 18.â Ex-Senator
Stephen M. White, guest of the Mer
chants* and Manufacturers' Association,
in an address to business men, advised
them to take more Interest in politics, and
said that it was necessary from a personal
as well as patriotic standpoint. Continu
ing, Mr. White said:
"I have always thought if I lived in a
California community from which a good,
intelligent, active man had been sent to
Congress. I would rather vote for his re
election than for any new man, no mat
ter what was his politics."
He spoke of the necessity of placing in
the Senate men who have at heart the
good of the people they represent, and
keeping them there long enough that they
may learn how Senatorial business is
done to accomplish the best results.
"Look at the situation in California.",
he said. "The chances are that we will
not have a Senator to succeed myself. . I
can say I would rather have Perkins
alone than Perkins with some one who
might be elected. I am convinced that
the people favor the election of Senators
by popular vote, and I believe this senti
ment is growing in Congress. This may
in time remedy some of the difficulties we
are now experiencing. To-day California
stands with less chance of influencing
Congress, with less weight in national af
fairs, than ever before. I do not say this
in any spirit of reflection on the present
delegation, but from . the fact that new
men are to take the places of those who
have learned their business." yyy.iy-

HIS FULL STRENGTH FINALLY EXPOSED
Thirty Votes Were All That Went to the Mexican Despite
the Many Boasts and Hard Work of the Touts
of the Candelarian.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 18.â Every available
foot of space on the main floor and In
the gallery of the Assembly chamber
was occupied this morning long before
the hour set for the joint session of the
Legislature. It was for the wind-up in
the Senatorial fight, and the struggle
for a place of vantage from which to
view the proceedings gave evidence of
the interest the long-drawn-out con
test has excited in the public mind.
The routine proceedings of the As
sembly were so badly hampered by the
rush for seats within the chamber that
it became necessary to adopt a resolu
tion to exclude all persons except mem
bers from the floor for the time being.
This order became a dead letter almost
as soon as it was made, and those who
wished to expedite the business of leg
islation were forced to accept the situa
tion and do the best they could.
When, at last, the noon hour arrived,
the chamber and gallery were packed
to suffocation, and over all there was
an air of expectancy that spoke vol- '
umes for what the events of the next
few hours might be expected to bring
forth. The reading of the min
utes of yesterday was pro
ceeded with in the ordinary way,
and when it was concluded the secre
taries at the desk were ordered to call
the roll on the vote for Senator. At
this there was a general stir and cran
ing of necks, a fact which went far to
prove that the confident assertions of
the Burns followers that they had the j
fight won and all that was necessary i
for them to do was to call in their
votes had had its effect on those not
familiar with the situation. y'-:y
If a wholesale landslide from one
candidate to another was expected, the
onlookers were badly disappointed, for
the first ballot showed not the change
of a single vote, and the second and
third were no different. Then the
Burns men showed their hands. As
semblyman Dibble, who is the recog
nized leader of the Burns forces on the
floor of the joint Assembly, offered-, a
resolution providing for a recess until
4 o'clock in the afternoon and moved
that it be adopted.
Before the motion was fairly j
launched Senator Boyce was on his
feet demanding recognition from the I
chair. When he got it he proceeded to i
present the views of the Grant forces |
in a way that was forcible and <at the j
same time extremely uncomplimentary j
to the Burns following.
"The time has come," said he, "for |
every member of this Legislature to
step forward and show his manhood in
the broad light of the. day that God
has given us. The manhood that has
resisted every attempt at corruption
that has been made during the past
months cannot falter at this, the
eleventh hour. Therefore I believe that
those who have the power to utter their
belief as to the questions that now con
front us can and should do so now. I
believe that these men will not agree *-
a recess that will give to those who
have before sought to corrupt the hon
est men of this body the opportunity
for which they seekâ the opportunity to
take legislators Into dark corners and
there seek to so Influence them that
they will do something that will defeat
the will of the people."
Dibble got up to defend his resolution
and In reply to Boyce said:
"I have no reply to make to such a
speech.- I have reasons to urge in my
support of my resolution, and one of
them is that a United States Senator
should be elected and we should do
everything within our power to bring
about such an election. There seems to
have been a crystallization of the oppo
sition in this Senatorial contest. I hope
and believe that the followers of each
of the candidates are casting their
votes as they do because they believe
it Is their loyal duty to do so. None
of us are going to leave our candidates
without their consent. Let us then take
a recess and thus give to our'candi
dates an opportunity to get together
and decide among themselves as to who
should be the successful one. Give
them a chance." *
Considering the poor material upon
which he had to base an argument,
Dibble's effort was a good one. Sena
tor Leavitt thought so at least, for he
moved the previous question in order
to shut off debate and bring the ques
tion to a vote, while Dibble's sophistry
was still undigested. The roll was
called and the resolution failed of
adoption by a vote of 56 ayes to 62 noes.
This was defeat No. 1 for the Burns
following. The Grant people voted al
most solidly against the resolution and
they were aided materially by a few
scattering votes from the Barnes
forces. The Democratic members voted
solidly against the. resolution.
Another ballot was taken without re
sult, but on the fifth ballot Burns pulled
In two members of his much-boasted
reserve strength. They were Assembly
men Marvin and Cosper. It has been
known these many weeks that Cosper
was a Burns man in disguise. It was
known when he was accused before the
invesigating committee ' with having,
through an agent, solicited a bribe of
$6000 from U. S. Grant, the statement
being made that he had received an of
fer of a like amount if he would vote
for Burns. Marvin has been promised
the position of superintendent of Ag
news 'Asylum if he would vote for
Burns for Senator.
The Burns claquers in all parts of
the chamber set up a great cheer when
Marvin changed from Barnes to Burns
and when Cosper changed from Scott
to Burns. The cheers had little effect
on the forces . of the ' other candidates.
Before the end of the rollcall was
reached Meserve of San Diego, A Dem
ocrat, voted for Grant and brought
that' candidate's total number of votes
up to thirty again. ,*
Having made the show of gaining
two , votes, Dibble took advantage of
the situation to again bring forth his
resolution for a recess. Before any ac
tion could be taken on it Senator Cut
ter offered a substitute resolution
which provided that the joint Assembly
should proceed to take ten more bal
lots, and if at the end of the tenth bal
lot no Senator had been elected the
joint Assembly should then stand ad
journed sine die.
This brought Senator Davis to his
feet. He said he was opposed to both
the substitute and the original motion.
He did not want the balloting limited
to ten ballots, and he did not believe
it was the proper time to ask for a re
cess at the very time when the change
of several votes indicated that the se
lection of a Senator was possible.
Acting on this suggestion. Cutter
withdrew his substitute, and Dibble,
seeing that his recess resolution was
doomed to defeat, very wisely asked
leave to withdraw it. .-'â :
Two more ballots were taken without
any additional changes being recorded,
# and then Senator Stratton offered a
resolution providing for the taking of
a recess until 7:30 o'clock this evening.
Cutter was on hand with another sub
stutute. This one provided for the tak
ing of twelve more ballots, and If, after
the twelfth ballot had been announced,
it was ' found that no Senator had
been chosen, the joint convention should
adjourn sine die.
Senator Smith voiced his own senti
ments and not those of the Grant men
when he announced that he was in fa
vor of defeating the substitute and
adopting the resolution providing for
a recess.
McDonald of Alameda stated in a
j manner that left no room for doubt as
I to his sincerity that he was in favor of
| the substitute. "We all have our minds
j made up," he said, "and if we are hon-
e st we will fight it out here and now."
The question was finally put to a vote
and the substitute was adopted by a
vote of 61 ayes to 57 noes. This was
the final turning point in the battle.
The vote made it apparent even to
those who would not see that Burns
I was a defeated candidate, and that he
| was not to be allowed the opportunity
to corrupt members during a recess.
This having been decided, the joint
I assembly settled down to the business
of balloting. On the second ballot of
j the series of twelve provided for by the
resolution, Muenter of San Joaquin
I changed from Barnes to Van R. Pater
-1 son. On- the third- Taylor of Alameda
1 changed from Barnes to Paterson, and
I on the fourth La Baree changed from
Barnes to Paterson. These changes
created but little stir, as it seemed to
be generally recognized that Paterson
was not even a dangerous possibility.
Burns fired his last gun during the
tenth ballot of the series. Miller of Los
Angeles was induced to vote for Burns,
and when his vote was announced his
clacquers set up another howl of ap
plause. This was the last change of
the day and left the two leading candi
dates Burns and Grant, with thirty
votes apiece.
After the twelfth ballot had been
taken President Flint ordered the min
utes of the joint assembly read in order
that they might be approved prior to
adjournment sine die.
When this had been done Dibble
raised the point of order that the joint
assembly could not adjourn sine die
for the reason that the Legislature had
not yet adjourned, and the constitu
tion provides that a ballot must be
taken on every day the Legislature is
in session. Speaker Anderson ruled the
point of order well taken, and the
Burns met set up another howl of de
light. Their joy . was destined to be
short lived, for the Speaker immediate
ly ruled that the joint assembly stood
adjourned sine die, unless the Legisla
ture remained in session another day.
He then announced that the joint as
sembly stood adjourned.
In all nineteen ballots were taken
during the afternoon, the joint assem
bly being constantly in session from
noon till 5:30 o'clock. During the bal
loting friends and supporters of Burns
were busy among the members, and
rumors of offers of money for votes
were flying from mouth to mouth.
Several members were taken to room
40 in the Capitol, which is used by
Burns as headquarters. What trans
pired there is known only to Burns and
those who visited him.
IS BARRED FROM
SEEING HIS FRIENDS
TOM WAUCUM ARRESTED AND
LODGED IN THE TANKS.
Was Discharged From the Palace Ho
tel and His Suddenly' Acquired
- Wealth Arouses Suspicion.
Tom Waucum, formerly a bellboy in the
Palace Hotel, was arrested last evening
by Policeman Baxter, and now occupies
a berth in the "tanks," pending an inves
tigation of his conduct during the past
week. He was removed from Stockton and
Market streets by the policeman, and
without an opportunity to" notify friends
of his 'incarceration he was lodged among
other men who are under ' suspicion of
having committed crime.
Waucum was a victim of his own lack
of wisdom. Earlier in the evening he
flashed a wallet containing a large num
ber of greenbacks among his friends and
enemies, and the latter having heard that
he was discharged from the Palace for
stealing, informed on him.
Since his discharge from the hotel he
has been on his "uppers." Out of kind
ness to him members of the "Comic" Club
at 850 Market street permitted him to
sleep there. Ho abused their kindness by
inviting a number of boon companions to
the place, and between, them they con
sumed all the liquor in the club. Last
night he repaired his breach of hospitality
by paying the club for the liquids im
bibed by himself and companions. A few
hours later he was placed in custody and
will remain secluded until the police in
vestigation is completed.
Benefit to Colburn.
A benefit entertainment was tendered to
Frank S. Colburn, globe trotter, humorist
and living image of the popular carica

gave general satisfaction. He will handle

The race that excited the greatest in

field looking for game, when suddenly
Emm saw something sneaking catlike
along the upper or southeast fence ot tne
oark and immediately gave chase. Mercy
May followed, but she was handicapped
by at least one hundred yards and did
not catch her opponent until Emm had
scored a turn. Mercy then got in or^ a
turn, driving the hare into Emm's mouth.
The course was not altogether satisfac
tory to the sportsmen who witnessed it.
still the race was judged according to
rule and Emm was declared the winner.
Golden Russett ran like a "flier" yester
day, and should she defeat Theron to
day in the second round the stake will
doubtless be hers. She will meet Jersey
Lily in the first round to-day, and unless
some accident happens her she should
easily win the flag. CApadUra was cer
tainly a sick dog when he entered the
slip, as he made no attempt at running, and
was easily defeated by Christmas Day.
Rusty Gold was defeated by Jennie Wil
son in a short run. Jennie was lucky that
she was slipped to a poor running hare.

THE PARIS COMMUNE.
Socialists Celebrate Its Twenty-
Eighth Anniversary in an Ap
propriate Manner.
The twenty-eighth anniversary of the
Paris Commune of IS7I was appropriately
celebrated by the Socialist Labor party
in Union-square Hall last night. M. W.
Wilkens acted as chairman of the even
ing, and made an introductory speech in
which he said: "The cause of the com
munists was the same as that of the so
cialists of to-day, but now it Is a politi
cal fight of labor against capital." He
then introduced G. B. Benham as the
speaker of the evening.
Mr. Benham in a few words painted a
picture of the cruelty which was inflicted
on the working classes by the capitalists
who were in control of the French Na
tional Assembly, and drew from it the
following lesson for the working classes:
"The intellectual leaders of the French
Commune were the officers of the Work
ingmen' International, an organization
which afterward spread throughout the
world, reaching as far as the Pacific
Coast. It was a secret organization, and
because it was it failed. The same les
son may be learned in regard to the nihi
lists, fighting against oppression in Rus
sia, and the Fenians in Ireland; it was
also the downfall of the Paris Commune.
The working classes have since fought in
the open by political action. They are
daily gaining in strength, and as * they
grow are weaving a fabric out of which
two garments will be madeâ one a shroud
for the capitalist system, and the other
the wedding garment of civilizationâ the
co-operative commonwealth of the work
ers of the world." â¢ <":â â '
Aside from the speeches an excellent
literary and musical programme was ren
dered. The "Marseillaise" was sung by the
Mannerchoir; solos were rendered by
Miss Martha Aspden, and George Aspden
gave several recitations. Short speeches
were delivered by members of the Social
ist Labor party.
ASSAULTED AN OFFICER.
John Aitkenson while drunk yesterday
boarded electric car 1124 of the Kentucky
street branch on Third street and com
menced to use vulgar and abusive lan
guage.. G. M. Lewis, the conductor, at
tempted to eject him, but met with resist
ance and a struggle, in which Aitkenson
clutched him by the throat, ensued.
Policeman C. L. Naylor witnessed the af
fair and at once undertook to separate
the pair. He was successful in handcuff
ing the burly offender and took him to
the corner of Mission and Third streets
to await the arrival of the patrol wagon.
While the officer was engaged in turning
in the call Aitkenson grasped the oppor
tunity, and striking his captor with the
cuffs made a dash for liberty. He was
promptly knocked out by a well-directed
blow from the officer's fists, and did not
regain consciousness until he . was near
the Central station. '* \
Naylor's nose was badly cut from the
blow he received. His wound was dressed
at the Receiving Hospital. Two charges
were booked against Aitkenson at the
station, and Conductor Lewis immediate
ly presented himself and added two more
âa charge of battery and having used
abusive and vulgar language.

HER KIDNAPED
INFANT CHILD
Mrs.O. C. Saake Again
Made Happy.
OFFICER M'MURRAY'S FIND
DISCOVERS THE MISSING GIRL
BY ACCIDENT.
A Romantic Story of a Bold Crime
That Nearly Drove a Woman
Into the Arms of
Despair.
Through the efforts of Officer H. Mc-
Murray of the California Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty, Mrs. O. C. Saake
ci 221- South Bunker Hill avenue, Los An
geles, has recovered her 5-year-old daugh
ter, Marie Manco. She was stolen by a
Mrs. Lillie Whittier some two and a half
years ago.
Mrs. Saake made every effort to find a
trace of her child, but without success.
The Whittier woman had been caring for
the young one while the mother was at
work and had taken a violent fancy to it, j
owing to its beauty and happy tempera- j
ment.
November 27, 1898, Mrs. Saake received a
letter from a man who signed himself Ed
Jarvis and gave his residence as 122 Turk
street. In this an attempt was made to
open negotiations for the return of the
child. A second letter from Jarvis fol
lowed, but nothing came of It.
Mrs. Saake on December 8 received an
other communication from a man named
Frank West of 613 Mission street in which
the latter claimed to know where
the child was, and offered to return it to
her if she would pay $150. West claimed
that he had fallen out with Mrs. Whit
tier, who had offered him the amount
mentioaed If he would take the child
East. He also stated that he wanted to
revenge himself on Mrs. Whittier, and
could do so by returning the child to her.
He also inclosed a picture of it.
Ail the communications were placed in
the hands of Chief of Police Glass of
Los Angeles, who on February 25 ad
dressed a letter to Chief Lees In which
lie stated that Marie Manco was the child
by Mrs. Haake's first marriage to a
Joseph Manco. He inclosed the picture
Bent by West, and also the correspond
ence of the latter and Jarvis, and request
ed that an officer be detailed on the case.
The matter was turned over to Officer
McMurray, who visited the residences
given by "the two men. but could find no
trace of them. He now believes they
were written by the kidnaper, who was
"tired of the child and wanted to get rid
of it. â '*-"'â  ' _ _. â
Through pure accident he discovered
t ll e child's wherer.bouts a day or two ago.
He was at the Maria Kip Orphanage on
business and saw the girl among the many
children out there. He intuitively picked
it up and its resemblance to the photo
graph furnished by West occurred to
him He questioned the little one and
learned that she came from Nanamlo.
B C where her father had died. He
found the girl was entered in the insti
tution under the name of Edith \N hltta

fact that she was Mrs. Saake kidnaped

SCHLEY DID NOT
ENTRAP CERVERA
The Spaniard "Bottled"
Himself.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. March IS. â Captain
Robley D. Evans contributes a chapter
to W. A. M. Goode's book, "With Samp
son Through the War," just issued.
Captain Evans describes how the lowa
joined Admiral Schley off Cienfuegos
on -May 22. After saluting the commo
dore the lowa became one of the flying
squadron and "proceeded to. drift leis
urely with it, off and on, Micawber
like, waiting for somethingâ hoped
the Spanish squadronâ to turn up."
Summing up the much-discussed
question of how Cervera was "bottled."
Captain Evans, after telling of the dis
covery of the Cristobal Colon on May
29, in the mouth of Santiago harbor,
writes as follows:
We signaled to the flagship (Brooklyn)
that the Spanish cruiser Cristobal Colon
was in the harbor, and the answer came
promptly. "I understand.". A moment
later a second Spanish cruiser supposed
to be the Maria Teresa, was discovered
to the left of Cayo Smith, and still. later ;
! the spars of a third were seen over the |
! land. The lowa was at once cleared for j
' action and everything was made ready
for battler as we felt sure the "Spaniards |
1 meant to fight. If they had wanted to j
escape they certainly had had every op
portunity to do so. Later on it was found
that Admiral Cervera had entered the j
' harbor of Santiago May 15, the day and
almost the hour the flying squadron lett
Key West for Cienfuegos.
It is, therefore, evident that the maneu
vering of the flying squadron had noth
ing to do with either forcing Cervera into
Santiago or preventing his escape there
from up to 7.45 a. m. May 29. '-'â  .-..- "-.
On June 1 Admiral Sampson arrived on
the New York and the lowa ceased to be
a vessel of the flying squadron. Th ad
miral's pian of blockade was substituted
for that of Commodore Schley and the be
j ginning of the end was in sight.
In another chapter entitled "A Bat
tleship in and Out of Action." the cap
tain gives the lesson that in a general
| way he deduced from the war:
First â absolute necessity for fast
armored cruisers capable of long sea en
durance. ;;â ;â¢';
.- â _.*-<.â ,. miâ supply of torpedo-boat
.destroyers. Â
Thirdâ absolute necessity for proper
colliers and supply vessels.
Fourthâ The absolute necessity for
smokeless powder.
Fifthâ The need of some instrument by
which the range can be accurately and I
rapidly obtained.
Sixthâ The necessity for a more perfect
system of communication, both as re
gards the ship herself and as between dif
ferent ships of the same squadron.
Seventhâ Necessity for smokeless fuel.
Eighthâ lnefficiency of lire from ships
against earthworks properly constructed.
Ninthâ Necessity for two conning tow
ers, one fore and one aft.
Regarding the best place from which
to fight a battleship Captain Evans
writes :
I know of no more devilish place than
the conning tower of a battle-ship in ac
tion.
Yet the former commander of the
lowa is forced to admit that, taking
into consideration the tactical value of
the captain's life, the conning tower is,
after all, the best, but by no means the
most pleasant place in action. Captain
Evans stated that he believed the effect j
of the rapid fire had been overestimated j
by the hasty conclusions drawn from j
the battle of July 3. Regarding water j
supply for ships Captain Evans writes: j
The effect of using salt water in the j
boilers of our battle-ships during the
late war was so injurious that it seems j
to me it would be j criminal to allow it to
occur again. We must either have a dis- j
tilling ship for, say two battle-ships in
our fleet, or else, knowing the amount ;
necessary to make good our waste, put !
in a battle-ship a distilling plant capable i
of distilling the amount required.

TORNADOES DEAL
DEATH TO MANY
Terrific Storms in the
South.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MEMPHIS, Term., March 18.â A. se
ries of windstorms swept through por
tions of Alabama, Mississippi and Ar
kansas to-day, doing an immense \
amount of property damage and kill- !
ing a number of people. The storms j
covered a radius of several hundred i
miles, destroying telegraph wires and
cutting off communication with a large i
part of the affected country. Cleburne
County, Alabama, seems to have suf
fered the most severely, the storm
there assuming the proportions of a i
tornado. The reports of fatalities in
the county vary from six to twenty
and many persons are said to have
been injured. At Sellers and Luverne,
Ala., much damage Is reported, and at
Rob Roy, Ark., one man was killed and
i several were badly injured. Dumas,
| Ark., was practically wiped out of ex- ''
I istence and several other towns in the
| vicinity suffered severely. One person j
:is reported killed at Hickory Flat, ;
'. Miss., and as the farmhouses in the vi- '
cinity suffered heavily. It is not un
' likely that many fatalities occurred
which have not yet been reached.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., March ISâ A
cyclone passed through the country
I here to-day, creating great havoc be- .
i tween Haflin and Edwardsville. It is
: known that seven members of the fam- I
I ily of Mr. Coffee, a farmer, are dead,
', and it is thought many others are in
jured, although on account c-f the dam- j
; age done by the storm to the telegraph i
\ wires it is impossible to give details.
; The house contained eleven persons
when it was struck by the storm. Thu
building was entirely demolished and
seven inmates were killed outright.
The path of the storm was about
twenty-five miles wide and the tornado
tore everything to pieces that lay be
fore it. Telegraph wires and poles are
down in every direction and trains are
delayed greatly on account of i.bris
piled on the track. It Is thought that
great damage has been done in the
farming district, but it is not believed
the cyclone struck any town.
HICKORY FLAT, Miss., March 18.â
A tornado struck this place to-day. The
school building and two churches were
j demolished and twenty-five dwellings
! blown down or unroofed. Several per
i sons received painful injuries. A fam
i ily living west of here lost its dwelling
\ and a young lady, name as yet un
known, was killed. Trees were torn up
; by the roots or twisted off like reeds,
and all fencing in the path of the cy
; clone leveled to the ground. On some
I farms near here hardly a building was
I left standing. Doubtless other fatali
ties will be reported, but news from the
district swept is meager. The course
j of the storm was from southwest to
northeast and its track was nearly a
| half mile wide, i
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., March 18.âA
i tornado passed through portions of Jef
j ferson and Desha counties this after
noon. Telegraph wires were blown
; down and the details are coming In
! slowly. At Rob Roy five houses, were
I blown down and one man killed. The
i town of Dumas, in Desha County, was
j struck and considerable damage don*.
j Nearly all the houses in the town were
j either blown down or damaged and
i several persons were Injured, but, so
I far as can be learned, no lives were lest.
i There are several small towns in the
j section through which the storm passed
| and as yet no news can be received
: from any of them.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., March 18.â
Cyclones passed over different portions
of the State to-day, but on account of
telegraph wires being down no particu
lars can be learned. At Selma. the
spire of the First Methodist Church
was blown down, crushing through the
roof and doing much damage. At Sel
lers, a small station on the Plant sys
tem, south of Montgomery, the entire
town, except three houses, was de
stroyed. Lucerne suffered greatly, but
no details can be got.
STANFORD VICTORIOUS.
Defeats the Fireman's Fund Team at
Baseball.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 18.â
By superior hitting the Varsity to-day ad
ministered its second defeat of the season
to the Fireman's Fund nine. The score
was 4 to .1. The visitors were unable to
connect with Lanagan, making but three
hits. The collegians, however, batted
Moskiman heavily, piling up eight hit*
against him. The game was a loose one,
j owing greatly to the inability of either
team to practice on account of the week's
rain. Eleven errors were rfiade, five of
which stand against the Varsity.

BERLIN, March 18.â The unex
pected Reichstag crisis, which has
overshadowed everything this week,
was brought about by the fact that the
Reichstag, judging from the words and
manner of the Minister of War, Gen
eral yon Gossler, was led to believe
that the Emparor and Bundesrath were
satisfied with the military bill as fixed
by the budget commission's report,
granting everything demanded in the
shape of reorganization of the artillery
and cavalry and an increase of the
army peace footing, except that only
7000 men were granted out of the 23,000
asked for. This, however. is really not
the case, so far as the Emperor is con
cerned, and it was only after the Min
ister of War suddenly announced that
i the report was considered insufficient
that it was discovered his Majesty in
sisted upon the passage of the bill in
its original shape, or else the Reich
stag would be dissolved and new elec
! tions ordered on this issue.
Those who are close to the Emperor
have repeated his sayings on the sub
ject which leave no room to doubt his
Majesty's attitude. But he is virtually
alone in the stand taken, since a ma
jority of the Bundesrath made it clear
to the Imperial Chancellor, Prince yon
Hohenlohe. on Wednesday that their
I governments were satisfied with the

bill in the shape reported. They fur
ther declared that a dissolution of the
Reichstag on such a trifling matter
seemed undesirable and injudicious.
The Bundesrath being constitutionally
the .final arbitrator in the matter, the
Emperor risked being discredited if he
carried out his intention of dissolving
the Reichstag, and it also seemed clear
that the result of an election would not
be more favorable to the Emperor's
wishes. The popular votes represented
by the majority rejecting the increase
in the peace footing of the army . on
Tuesday, the vote standing 209 to 141,
outnumbered the votes rejecting other
proposals by almost two to one.
The statements of the leaders of the
Reichstag carried much weight, Dr.
Lieber, spokesman of the Centre party,
showing that within a few. years, be
sides the regular military appropria
tions, the Reichstag has voted 733,000,
--000 marks, but the peace strength of
the army is much stronger than ap
pears from the bill, being really con
siderably over 600,000 men.
This effective arraignment of the in
satiable military demands, and the
statements of the other opposition lead
ers made a considerable impression.
Herr Richter; the German radical
leader, said: "If the Reichstag was
now dissolved it would not be because
of this trifling reduction in the mili
tary bill, but because another Reich
stag is wanted, one which will pass a
reactionary anti-strike bill and modify
the election laws, and its motto will bÂ»
autocratic, absolute government and
destruction of the Reichstag's inde
pendence.' "
This sally and similar remarks made
b%' another speaker were heartily ap
plauded by the whole Right, and it was
openly declared that the members of
the party were not eager to enter into
a new fight at the polls.
Nevertheless, it was very hard to
change the Emperor's mind, and it was
only at the last moment before he
started for Friedrichsruhe to attend the
entombment of the remains of Prince
and Princess Bismarck, two hours be
fore the decision of the Reichstag, that
he told the Imperial Chancellor and
Count yon Posadowsky-Wehner, Sec
retary of State for the Interior, that he
would content himself with the reduc
tion, and this was only after it was
shown to him that, by the additional
resolution, the Government would be
assured a few years hence of what it
contended for.
Still the Emperor felt that the Reichs
tag's action was a personal defeat and
his mortification was.correspondingly
great, for the Influence of the court
military party for weeks has been
strongly exerted in the decision of not
yielding in this matter. The triumphal
shoutings and spoutings of the opposi
tion on Tuesday, when it became evi
dent that the Government and the Em
peror would yield and utterances of a
like nature in the opposition press have
helped to intensify his Majesty's morti
fication. It is said that he feels dis
i satisfied with Prince Hohenlohe, Gen

was seen by The Call correspondent to

beef investigation and the rumor that he
is supplying evidence to General Mile*.
Dr. Webb said: -".- ." v
"I really haven't anything to say in re

the blame upon those who deserve it."
In regard to his supplying evidence to
General Miles Dr. Webb would say noth
ing whatever, and he declined to discuss
he present aspect of the beef inquiry or
.is personal interest ln the case. He said,
however, that his opinion was still that
General Miles was right and had been
right from the first; the beef was bad and
Mile- had the courage to say so. He be
lieves Miles is a man who has the best
interest! of his soldiers at heart and ia
altogether a credit to the army.
Dr. Webb thinks the treatment of the
commanding general in this matter haa

SO BATTLES FOUGHT
Says Skirmishes Are Magnified by
the Press Censor Into Des
perate Fights.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 19.â Jour
nal's Manila correspondent sends the
following via Hongkong to escape the
rigorous censorship established at Ma
nila:
The movements of General Wh<.ot
on's flying brigade around Pasig dur
ing the past week have been largely ex
aggerated. The censor has refused to
allow correspondents to report the plain
fact that the insurgents simply ran
away before the advances of the Ameri
can troops. He seemed to wish that all
dispatches sent should represent small
skirmishes as serious battles, with the
natives resisting furiously. The com
plaisant correspondents were made to
represent the insurgent losses as
enormous.
General Otis' advances, however, ac
tually' consist of elaborate skirmishes,
with few losses, with no decided for
ward movement. Indeed, there is much
delay, and Lawton has not been as
signed to duty. Admiral Dewey ex
pressed satisfaction over the arrival of
General Lawton and said:
"I am in favor of going ahead
right now and taking everything in
sight. We have forces enough to end
the war if we go right in and fight.
My opinion is the hostilities are car
ried on almost exclusively by Tagallos.'
We ought to be able to crush their op
position quickly. I do not anticipate
any difficulty in occupying the south
ern islands of the archipelago. After
the present hostilities end we ought not
to need a great naval force in the Phil- j
ippines. Spain had to maintain an ex
pensive squadron here, because she al- '
ways had the screws on the people. It
was a continued military occupation,
but that is not our style of govern
ment." _____

ILOILO, Island of Panay, March 12.
via Manila, March 18. The situation
here is practically unchanged despite
the plucky but abortive attempt of a
British officer to effect a compromise.
Yesterday Lieutenant Commander
Cowper of the British gunboat Plover,
accompanied by an English resident
and Raimundo Melliza, former presi
dent of the Filipino congress for Panay,
crossed the lines unofficially and at
tempted to advise the natives to aban
don their opposition to the Americans,
their intention to do so having been
previously communicated to General
Miller, who granted them facilities.
Senor Melliza is a leading merchant,
having large interests in Iloilo and the
, surrounding country. When a collision
i with the Americans seemed inevitable
I Senor Melliza resigned the presidency,
which is now held by Victorino Mapa, i
The party went by way of Molo to
i the town of Mandurrlao, where they
| dismounted and under a flag of truce
i walked two miles to the first insurgent
i trenches. They were met by sixteen
of the leading political and military' in
surgents, but not by Pablo Arreta, the
principal Visayan general, President
Mapa, nor Diogno, the Tagallo general,
who acts as adviser and as Aguinaldo's
representative.
The conference was held in a house
i and lasted for a considerable time,
those attending speaking in Spanish.
Lieutenant Commander Cowper was
much impressed by the youthfulness
and smartness of the leaders. He coun
seled an agreement with the Amer
icans, who, he said, had no intention
to rule in the spirit old Spain did, but
to improve the country for the benefit
of the people.
The natives reiterated their charges
that the Americans were acting in bad
faith; that their acts were not in ac
cordance with fair words. . They as
sured Lieutenant Commander Cowper
that they were not fighting from choice
and were desirous of resuming their
business and peaceful pursuits, but
were determined to make no com
promise without consulting Aguinaldo.
They will stand or fall with the island
of Luzon. They treated Lieutenant
Commander Cowper and his compan
ions courteously.
When asked by him as a last resort
what suggestion they had to make
toward a solution, they assured him
frankly they were willing to negotiate
for peace through one of the great pow
ers, preferably Great Britain.
Lieutenant Commander Cowper re
ported the result of the conference to
General Miller. Despite this failure
the kind treatment by the Americans
under General Miller's express orders i
is having an excellent effect on the j
lower class of natives, whose daily oc
cupations ' are conducted in the fields
close to the American lines. The na
tives come and go. bringing produce,
and the only precaution is a search to
prevent the introduction of weapons.
Owing to the daily increase In the num
ber of laborers in the city It is hoped
business will soon resume its former

It is evident the military and Tagal
element is preventing the collapse of
the hostile movement. They are circu
lating absurd stories of Filipino suc
cesses in the vicinity of Manila and the
capture of numerous American pris
oners.
Yesterday I drove through to Molo
and over a mile outside the lines with
Major Cheetham of the Tennessee Reg
iment. "We found the natives ex
tremely friendly and peaceful and busy
with their' marketing. We visited Cor
nelllo Melliza, an old native planter,
father of Raimundo. He spoke hope
fully of a speedy settlement and regret

Since February 11 the Molo end of the
line has been quiet. At the Jaro end
there have been a few shots, but no
casualties, the insurgents never ap
proaching our position in large num
bers. The British gunboat Pigmy left
Cebu on March 1 and visited Tacloban,
in the island of Leyte, Barugo, Cal
bayon, Catbalogan and Lagranga in
Samar and Gubat and Legaspi in Lu
zon, inquiring as to the safety of Brit
ish subjects.
So far as the officials learned, the
lives and property of the British are
safe, but the Filipino leaders admitted
the difficulty of controlling men who do
not belong to the districts visited and
who evidently are holding together
with the prospect of loot, the majority
being soldiers from the city of Manila,
whom the local people are supporting
half-heartedly. Commander Greene
found a strong hostile feeling toward
the Americans among these imported
braves.
Many untrue reports are circulated
among ignorant people of the alleged
cruelty of the Americans. The stories
formerly told against the Spaniards of
looting and . ravishing are " being re
peated against the Americans. At Call
bayou, in Samar, an American named
Rescott, employed by Warner, Barnes
& Co., a British firm, is held under
parole. Commander Greene, accom
panied by James Macleod of Warners,
saw General Luekban at Catbalogan
and told him he would be held respon
sible for any harm to Mr. Scott. After
assurances of good will Mr. Scott was
returned to Callbayou.
From Barugo, one Guisti, an Ameri

OTIS TO SEND OUT
A SECOND COLUMN
WASHINGTON, March 18.â General
Otis is planning, another blow at the
insurgents in the execution of his gen
eral scheme of hastening the ending of
the rebellion in Luzon before the ad
vent of the rainy season. The fact ap
peared quite incidentally in a cable
gram received from him, in which he
replied to an inquiry from the War De
partment relative to the discharge of
the volunteer soldiers serving in his
army. These soldiers are entitled, by
the promise of the War Department,
and, perhaps, by the terms of their en
listment, to be sent home as soon as
they can be relieved by regulars.
General Otis said the men were will
ing to stay in the Philippines as long
as they could be of active service, and
then he added that he was about to
have some work of importance for
them, indicating that another general
movement forward was in prospect.
This understanding is confirmed by the
report from Manila that another col
umn, in addition to that of Wheaton,
is being formed under Lawton's lead,
and it is believed this will be pushed
rapidly northward from Manila, in
closing between itself and Wheaton's
column the largest body of the insur
gents remaining in the neighborhood of

The advance was discovered by the

the rebels were in force, and three com

VAST TASK OF
CONQUEST AND
OCCUPATION
Cecil Rhodes' Talk on Ameri
can Expansion Brings Out
Sensational Comment.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, March 18.â The newspap
ers this week reprinted from the Am
erican papers the interview which a
correspondent of the Associated Press
had with Cecil Rhodes on board the
steamer Hapsburg, on the Mediterran
ean, and which was mailed from Alex
andria, Egypt, on February 11, and
printed on March 3, in America. The
remarks of Mr. Rhodes on America's
imperial future have attracted a great
deal of attention.
The Spectator, however, suggests
that the energy of the Americans may
not prove persistent enough for the
vast task of conquest and occupation
which the South African statesman
sets before them, adding: "Their sys
tem, though it produces men of ability,
ls probably not favorable to the de
velopment of a meteoric genius, and
without such a man the work can
hardly be done rapidly. Eating up
South America like an artichoke. State
by State, is a task to overstrain any
people, even the Americans. The car
rying out of the work, too. might bring
to a head the great danger of the
United Statesâ the difference in the
ideal and permanent tendency between
the North and South. It is true that
the State system of America, is a won
derful system of empire; but it is also
a wonderful provision for disintegra
tion. The North may refuse to persist
In a career of conquest, which wearies
It, and with Canada may elect to form
a republic with another ideal than gov
erning, which, although attractive,
wears out the surplus energy of the
governors. If any one tells us the
United States will expand to the Straits
of Magellan in spite of themselves we
may believe him. But if he says, as
Mr. Rhodes says, that this expansion
will be deliberate we shall hesitate and
ask for evidence that they wish the
expansion to last."
Mr. Rhodes' striking personality stood
out in bold relief this week against the
political background of minor interests.
The press of three countries, Great
Britain, Germany and France, was full
of him. His visit to Berlin marks an
important onward step in the Anglo-
German understanding, and the French
papers realize this, and the idea that
the assistance of Germany might even
tually be counted upon in a war be
tween France and Great Britain is
preposterous.
The Figaro sees in Mr. Rhodes' re
ception at Berlin sure proof of a secret
convention between Great Britain and
Germany, while the Temps says:
"Frankly, it is impossible to overrate
its importance. It is plain proof of
Emperor William's desire for a rap
prochement with Great Britain, and the
power and \welght of such a combina
tion cannot be exaggerated. It ought
-to furnish food for reflection for those
who fancied that France only had to
make overtures in order to bring Ger
many to her feet, and who, acting un
der this delusion, have been striving to
bring about a rupture with Great Brit
ain."

ranged a hard and fast agreement re
specting the Cape to Cairo railroad.
Politically Mr. Rhodes and the Em
peror have agreed, but financially their
arrangement is hanging fire and the
negotiations between Mr. Rhodes and
a German syndicate respecting finan
cing the German portion of the road
have not yet been concluded, though
Mr. Rhodes has expressed the hope
that an early agreement will be ar
rived at. 7, _, ,'
Further, it appears that Mr. Rhodes
expressed astonishment at the German
Emperor's surprising knowledge of the
details of the matter, and German offl-'
rials in their turn, were surprised at
Mr. Rhodes' candid allusion to future
political projects, including an Anglo-
German partition of Portugal's East
Africa possessions, which Mr. Rhodes
fully expects that Portugal will be will
ing to sell the two powers within three
years. At present Mr. Rhodes is in

PUGILISTIC BOUTS
Los Aogeles Police f^aid a Baro
Where F ghtiog Is in
Progress.
LOS ANGELES, March 18.â More tha.n forty boys, ranging in age
from 12 to 17 years, crowded the loft of a barn In Boyle Heights and
witnessed pugilistic contests by youthful slopgcrs. There was a roped
arena, towels, bottles, sponges and all other accessories of a prize
fight, and there were fighters, seconds and time-keepers galore. Two
youngsters fought a six-round draw, and other preliminaries had been
pulled off when the crowd of boys that swarmed around the barn at
tracted attention to the juvenile pugilists, causing a squad of police to
appear in response to a telephone message.
- The policemen entered without paying, the price being a nlckle, and
Jumped into the ring at a moment when the principals of the main con
test, stripped to the skin, had Just marched to the center and were
going It hammer and tongs. They declared the fight off and arrested
seven of the principals, who were taken to thÂ« police station. They
gave as their names: Walter Greening. Walter Relnachild, Robert Cole
man, Clarence Reese, Jerome Raleigh. Plumber Montgomery and Rob
ert Valle. Â«"
The youngsters had been fighting in bouts for several hours and the
bloodshed was considerable. Arnica, courtplaster and hot bath 3 were
greatly in evidence ln many fashionable east-side homes after 4:30
o'clock this afternoon.

Special Dispatch to The- Call.
SEATTLE. March 18.â Francis A.
Holterman. who has just arrived here
from Copper River, Alaska, tells a
story of the fortunate rescue of him
self and son by a missionary after they
had been abandoned by Indians whom
they had employed to guide them to
the coast.
Holterman, with his son Bernard.
James Morris and Angelo Jenkins, were
prospecting on the Altesek River. Their
provisions were reduced to a six days'
supply and they arranged with a party
of Indians to guide them to Yokutat,
about fifty miles down the coast. The
Indians compelled them to leave their
baggage behind, which they afterward
appropriated. After taking Hotter
man and his party down the coast a
short distance the Indian guides de
serted them in the expectation that
they would perish. Holterman thinks,
and that they would fall heir to all the
prospectors' effects. After traveling a
few weeks the party was found by Rev.
Mr. Hendrickson, a missionary of Yo
kutat Bay. Holterman and his son
â were unconscious and Morris and Jen
kins were both delirious. The miners
of Yokutat organized a party to pun
ish the Indians, but they had disap
peared. ~,~y,i ,
While wandering around Holterman s
son accidentally shot himself through
the wrist. Both Holterman and his son
are suffering from the effects of scurvy.
RAIN CHANGES THE
FINANCIAL OUTLOOK
SAN LUIS OBISPO, March 18.â Cashier
Jack of the suspended County Bank says
the question of reopening the bank soon
will depend upon the actions of the direc
tors, who will meet shortly. The situation
has changed within the last few days, be
cause of the rain. When asked in regard
to the sale of beet lands which had been
pending during the winter he could not
cay whether the deal would be closed
now. It is late in the season to get the
land into shape for beets. Although the
sale is not acually off. he could not say
what action th.- prospective purchasers
would take. Mr. Jack added that since
the rains had changed the outlook from
gloom to brightness the bank had had
many inquiries for lands, and it was the
intention to dispose of as much as pos
sible and he felt confident a great deal
could be placed within a short time.

HEART DISEASE.
SOME FACTS REGARDING THE RAPID IN-
CREASE OF HEART TROUBLES.
Do Not Be Alarmed, but Look for
the Cause.
Heart troubles, at least among the
Americans, are certainly Increasing, and
while this may be largely due to the ex-
citement and worry of American business
life, it ls more often the result of weak
stomachs, of poor digestion.
Real organic disease Is incurable: but
not one case in a hundred of heart trouble
is organic.
The close relation between heart trouble
and poor digestion is because both organs
are controlled by the same great nerves,
the Sympathetic and Pneumogastrlc.
In another way, also, the heart, ls af-
fected by the form of poor digestion,
which causes gas and fermentation from
half digested food. There is a feeling of
oppression and heaviness in the cheat
caused by pressure of the distended stom-
ach on the heart and lungs, interfering
with their action; hence arises palpitation
and short breath.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood,
making it thin and watery, which irritates
and weakens the heart. w _- .
The most sensible treatment for heart
trouble is to Improve the digestion and to
insure the prompt assimilation of food.
This can be done by the regular use
after meals of some safe, pleasant and ef-
fective digestive preparation, like Stuarts
Dyspepsia Tablets, which may be found
at most, drug stores and which conta n
valuable, harmless digestive elements in
a pleasant, convenient form.
It is safe to say that the regular persis-
tent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets at
meal time will cure any form of stomach
trouble except cancer of the stomach.
Full sized package of these tablets sold
by druggists at 50 cents. Little book on
Btomach troubles mailed free. Address

TRADE FIGURES
NOT CORRECT
Germans Argue on a
False Basis.
PORTER'S WORK HANDICAPPED
GOODS IN TRANSIT CLASSED AS
IMPORTS.
It Is Erroneously Asserted by Berlin
Officials That the Balance of
Trade Is Going Too Much
the American Way.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, March 18.â The newspapers
are discussing the chances of effecting
a commercial treaty with the United
States, taking as a basis the arguments
for and against the figures quoted by
Count yon Posadowsky-Wehner in the
Reichstag a month ago, purporting to
give the official statistics of the im
ports, and exports of Germany and the
United States. These are seriously in
correct and do not tally with the
figures furnished to Robert P. Porter
since he has been here by Oscar P.
Austin, chief of the Bureau of Statistics
of the United States Treasury Depart
ment. The latter has collected" official j
figures dealing with both fiscal calen- ;
| dars for the year 1898 and they both !
show an enormous discrepancy com- i
pared with the figures of Count yon i
Posadowsky-Wehner. The latter set i
forth that the excess of imports of
American goods compared with the ex
ports to the United States in 1898 was
507,500,000 marks, the imports being
852,000,000 marks and the exports 344,
--000,000 marks. According to the United |
States Treasury Department the Amer
ican exports to Germany during the
last fiscal year were about 624,000,000
marks, while for the calendar year they
were 172,000,000 marks below Count yon j
Posadowsky-Wehner's figures. This '.
enormous and unexplained discrepancy
is greatly hampering the negotiations
for a "commercial treaty and almost
bars Mr. Porter's way for the present.
Germany claims that the balance of
trade has lately been going, under the
| Dingley law, too much the American
I way to make a treaty under the ex
isting conditions profitable to Germany. ,
In proof of this the German officials
adduce the alleged enormous American
surplus, of __9_.
According to the American figures
I the excess of American exports to Ger-
I many during the ten years between 1888
! and 1898 is only $115,000,000, or less than
' the excess which Germany claims for
1898 alone. During 1889-90-91 and '93
; Germany exported an excess to the
! United States, while the annual aver
! age of America's excess of exports to
Germany for ten years is only a little
1 over $11,000,000, a trifle in so enormous
'â  a trade, of which, moreover, 2,240,000
i marks were raw material cotton, cop
â  per, tobacco and petroleum â from the
United States and produced in Ger
many, whereof the latter enhances the
value by manufacturing, showing that
trade with the United States was a
source of great profit to Germany in
stead of loss.
An American expert here has fur
nished the correspondent of the Asso
ciated Press with what seems to be a
i good explanation of the above discrep
ancy. Count yon Posadowsky-Wehner's
figures include among the imports from
the United States all goods passing
through Germany in transit, which
form a very large amount, but Just how ;
large cannot.be stated precisely.
The expert does not take into account
the fact that nearly the whole carry
ing of exports from the United States
to Germany is done in German vessels,
the profits of which are also large. A
German expert showed these figures to
a British statesman, and the latter,
after carefully studying them, said: "A j
magnificent showing for Germany. It
would be a magnificent showing for any
country."
According to the butchers' organ, the
Government has decided to place Amer
ican "hard sausage" on a higher tariff
as a luxury. This Increases the duty
from 17 to 60 marks per 100 kilos.
Referring to the visit here of Cecil
Rhodes, a number of papers have dis
cussed whether it would not be best to
Insist upon Samoa in exchange for Ger
many's consent to the building of the
Cape-to-Cairo railroad through Ger
man East Africa. The Deutsche Zei
' tung approves of the scheme.
In the meanwhile the United States'
Embassador, Andrew D. White, tells ]
the correspondent that though he has !
not received any recent instructions on j
the subject, he does not doubt tne cor- '
rectness of the dispatches -from Wash- :
ington saying the status quo will be
maintained at Samoa, and that Herr J
Solf, the new municipal president of
! Apia, will be confirmed by the United
'â  States and Great Britain. Mr. Whit-?
j added that Herr Solf seemed to be the
proper man for the position, and that
I if Mataafa behaves decently and if the
ineligibility of Malletoa Tanu be shown
there probably will be no objection to
Mataafa's continuance on the throne.
The Embassador further remarked that
so far, except with a possible singular
particular, it has been shown that Chief
Justice Chambers had behaved cor
rectly.

work of canals touching at Dortmund,
Magdeburg, Osnabruck, Mlnden, Lin

wide at the bottom and thirty meters
wide at the surface. The state assumes

SLIGHT REDUCTION
IN INSURANCE RATES
Hre Underwriters Take Action Af
fecting Downtown Districts
in San Francisco.
DEL MONTE. March 18.â Board of
Fire Underwriters â¢of the Pacific- _ con
j 2 THE EMPORIUM. ;
cluded its last session at this place at 10
o'clock to-night and adjourned to | San
Francisco. This course was necessary for
the reasonsâ first, because the business
was unfinished and second, because the
members of the board cannot remain here
longer than to-morrow. Three long ses
sions were held to-day.
The morning session was devoted to fur
ther consideration of rates for San Fran
cisco which resulted in action making
some reduction of rates in downtown dis
tricts of the city, chiefly in connection
with what is called coinsurance. The
reduction will be made in some instances
onlyâ not in all. The competition of board
companies with non-board companies
was given further consideration, but no
action beyond that of yesterday was
taken.
The chief question before the board at
both afternoon and evening sessions re
ferred to Insurance solicitors and was dis
cussed in two phasesâ first, as regards
compensation . to be paid solicitors.; and
second, as to qualifications needed to en
title a man to be a solicitor. No definite
action was taken in either.
The members of the board -will j leave
I THE EMPORIUM.
here to-morrow morning and open their
final session in San Francisco on Mon
day morning. The work there will consist
chiefly, says President Charles D. Haven,
of gathering up t.he threads of subjects
worked upon during the past week and
disposing of them for the coming year.
COUNTY GOVERNMENT
ACT DENOUNCED
Santa Clara County Citizens Ask Mr.

Measure.
SAN JOSE, March 18.â Senator More
house's amendment to the county govern
ment act giving Santa Clara County a
License Collector at $150 a month, a Pros
ecuting Attorney at $100 and the District
Attorney a clerk at $50 a month does not
meet the approval of taxpayers. Never
before has there been such universal con
demnation of 'a * measure, and its author
I THE EMPORIUM.
is undoubtedly the most unpopular Sena
tor-ever sent from this county. To-day
several hundred telegraph messages' were
sent to Governor Gage urging him to veto
the measure. The Farmers' Club and
the Republican Good Government League
adopted resolutions condemning the act
and have forwarded them to Sacramento.
By the terms of the bill the running ex
penses of the county are greatly in
creased, besides the creating of these use
less positions for three or four politicians,
if the measure be not vetoed the citizens
have expressed a determination to test
its constitutionality. "

POLITICS AND PORT CHARGES.
NOT since the disclosures made by The Call of
the jobs carried out in the construction of the
ferry depot has there been such a thorough
revelation of the waste of money by the Harbor
Commissioners as that set forth in the current num
ber of the Merchants' Association Review by John E.
Quinn.
The theme of Mr. Quinn's article is "Politics'and
Port Charges," and its object is to show that one rea
son why the commerce of the city is handicapped by
excessive charges is that the administration of the
water front is conducted, not in the interests of the
community, but of office-seekers and tax-eaters. As
Mr. Quinn says, â¢"There seems to be no interest in
anything but the political machine and how to pro
mote it."
The general charges of the paper are backed up by
specific statements of offenses. Thus it is said a
delegation of Los Angeles politicians demanded a
part of the water front spoils, and they were given
the office of storekeeper, with a salary of $175 a
month. To that there was added an assistant at $75
a month and a teamster at $125 a month.
Other examples are hardly less glaring. "A promi
nent politician demanded a place for one of his
her.chmen. There being no vacancy, the office of
grain inspector, at $100 a month, with nothing to do,
was created-. The superintendent of repairs receives
$200 per month, the assistant superintendent $150,
boss carpenter $100, janitor to take care of the office
(one room) $75â -$525 monthly for this department,
which the commission claims is a dead loss, as all
the work that they do costs the State three times as
much as it would if contracted for."
An itemized statement is given showing that the j
monthly salary roll of the ferry depot employes I
amounts to $2732 .30. while the total revenues de- !
rived from rents reach no larger sum that $1795, leav- j
ing a monthly deficit of $937 30.
.One of the notable disclosures of the article is that j
when asked why the Southern Pacific and other rail- j
roads were not paying their share for the maintenance |
of the depot, the secretary of the Harbor Commission
replied they had not been able to come to an agree- j
ment with the roads as yet. When further questioned
how they had arrived at the rent for the postoffice, I
news stand and others who were paying rent, the i
reply was that it was a mistake not to have had the ;
terms for the railroads arranged before they entered""
the building, but now that they were there the small
roads were pleading poverty, and the large one
claimed that it had not increased its business and
did not see why it should be compelled to pay inter
est on such an expensive structure.
Discussing the problem of a remedy for the evil
Mr. Quinn suggests the appointment of a strong
committee of investigation to collect all the facts
showing the abuses and then making on that foun
dation an appeal to the Governor for relief. In the
absence of any better plan that proposed ought to be
tried. It may prove, in the end, to be no more than
another kick, but that will be better than a silent :
submission to the wrong which by tolerating it con- i
sents to it. 'â¢-

cesspool involves humiliation.
P There will be no fault found with the police for

TRIUMPH OF THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY,
THE defeat of Dan Burns and of the railroad in
fluence behind him is a marked triumph of the
Republican party. In the history of this State
it has not been paralleled. The railroad, during the
last campaign, deliberately cheated the press and the
people. It declared, through its representatives in*
San Francisco and all over the State,' in terms that
would bind the honor of any individual or organiza
tion, that it was out of politics. The moment the
election was over it did not even preserve the forms"
through which prudent men sometimes endeavor to <
conceal their lack of integrity, but arrogantly and
openly scouted its pledges and revealed the candidacy
of Dan Burns, which, to the last moment, it forced
upon the Legislature. That it ultimately failed is
largely due to the efforts of The Call and the Chron
icle, assisted by other Republican newspapers and the
mass of the Republican party.
We do not feel inclined to indulge in congratula
tions. It was a burning shame that a man like Dan
Burns, a mere creature of an unprincipled monopoly,
could maintain a deadlock and for two years deprive
California of half of its representation in the Senate
of the United States. Every man who voted for him
during the long and monotonous struggle that has
just ended was untrue to himself, untrue to his party,
untrue to his country," and controlled by influences
directly opposed to the public welfare. The only
ground for exultation is that, for the first time in the*
history of the* State, since the railroad assumed the
direction of its politics, that audacious and formid
able power "has been beaten. To elect a man who is
fit for the Senatorship was impossible without the aid
of th- Democratic minority, and from the beginning
to the end of the struggle the organ of that minority
used whatever force it possessed to assist the railroad
designs. Whatever the motives by which some of
them were actuated, at least fifty- five members of the
Republican majority were not captured for or by Dan
Burns, and while, as we have already suggested, this
number even if united could not have elected a Senator,
they were sufficient to prevent a secret caucus and to
maintain the honor and the integrity of their party.
Even the Examiner now, with all its unscrupulous-
ness, can scarcely have the audacity to claim that the
Republican State Convention of last year was manipu
lated by the railroad, or that the Republican party or
the Republican press deceived the people. With all
its money and with all its power, from twenty-four to
thirty legislators represented the entire delegation the
railroad was enabled to secure, and these sen-ants of
corruption lost their fight and individually and col
lectively will be promptly relegated to the obscurity
from which they should never have emerged. There
have been few sessions of the Legislature in which
more than thirty Democratic votes could not be relied
upon by the railroad.
Dan Burns is politically dead, and in the same-con
dition in which Lazarus was found after he had lain
four days in the tomb. He will never be resurrected.
The railroad power is disrupted. The history of the
legislative session will be an enduring and effective
lesson to the people. The Republican party of Cali
fornia will enter the Presidential campaign of 1900
with cleansed skirts, and the purpose of the railroad,
under its Democratic management, aided by the Ex
aminer, to steal the State for the Democracy, will be
frustrated.
It is due to Governor Gage to say that, however
injudiciously he may have been betrayed into the ex
pression of an individual preference for Dan Burns,
chiefly based upon a supposed but imaginary debt of
gratitude, he held aloof from the actual contest and
maintained the dignity of his high office. The atti
tude of Ulysses S. Grant at the beginning of the ses
sion and as exposed by the investigation was not
creditable, but it was half redeemed by the rejection
of the proffered coalition with Burns. The remain
ing candidates preserved their personal self-respect
and refused entangling and disreputable alliances. It
is fortunate that in Senator Perkins the State has a
representative by whom it will not be discredited, and
there is no probability that two years hence, or at
any future period, the degrading experience of 1899
will be repeated.
fl SECULAR VIEW OF THE CHURCH-
IN the United States church and state are com
pletely separated, all religious tests abolished, and,
within broad and definite limits, absolute toleration
established. The Government is not pagan nor
atheistic, but it is unsectarian, and rests upon the
moral law, as recognized by all sects and in all creeds
that are consistent with modern civilization.
Because, however, the wise and liberal founders of
this republic eliminated from the political system they
devised and perfected the seeds of factional discord
that had rent Europe asunder, it is not to be inferred"
that they disregarded or thrust aside the religious
element in that broad sense which included Christian
ity and Judaism. The signers of the Declaration of
Independence and the framers of the constitution,
with few exceptions, were devout men, representing
almost every form of religious activity. In all their
acts they recognized the existence of a Supreme
Being, to whom they appealed and upon whom they
relied. Washington scarcely wrote a proclamation as
General, or a state paper as President, in which this
fundamental belief was not expressed. From his day
tc the present time every President, not excepting
Jefferson, has followed his example. In statesman
ship, in diplomacy, in military and in naval opera
tions, in the decisions of the courts, in Congressional
and in legislative enactments, in the stable literature
of the country, in all the phases through which s our
national life has passed, there has so far been 'no de
viation from the foundation upon which our institu
tions were originally placed.
The only aspect, therefore, in which the secular
press in the United States can logically regard the
church is that which, discarding theologies and separ
ating boundaries and diversities, treats it as represent
ing the essential unities that hold all men together
within the political edifice that our fathers con
structedâthat is to say, belief in a Supreme Being
and in the moral law. Treated . from that point of
view, and excluding every element of dissension that
can exist among civilized men, it must be regarded
as the mightiest and most controlling force that has
entered into human life and influenced the develop
ment of the world. Strike out from history Judaism,
that inexorably maintained' the Conception of the
Deity, Christianity, that formulated the principle of
fraternity, that as regards the relations between . men
is the essence of the moral law, and their blended
force in the movement^ of humanity since the dawn

of the Christian era, and Europe, . America, Aus
tralasia, and their combined spheres of influence,
morally, intellectually and even materially, would be
without an intelligible reason for their existence,
The part that the church or religion, in the sense in
which those words are now used, has taken in the
rise and progress of individual, social and national
life is the solvent and the explanation of the mys
terious energies that have produced the political and
intellectual triumphs of the nineteenth century, and
as the twentieth century approaches sound the ex
ulting note of incomparable progress. The wars, the
persecutions, the cruelties, the corruptions, that as we
look backward are so prominent in the line of the
centuries, though coupled with religious names and
with religious organizations, when stripped of their
false coverings and reduced to their realities have
represented the obstructive and ever-diminishing
power of barbarism in all its multifarious forms, and
in a great degree have had a political origin and mo
tive. But the progress of education, the increase of
mental and moral strength in individuals, the ad
herence to monogamy as defining the true relation
between the sexes, the growing enfranchisement of
women, the progress of society, the multiplication of
employments and of avenues for skilled labor, the
application of inventive genius to the necessities and
to the comforts of life, the diffusion and the exten
sion of commerce, the simplification of art, science
and philosophy so that they are at once deeper and
truer and yet within the reach of average intelligence,
the universality of literature in its transient and in its
permanent forms, and guaranteeing and aiding all
these elements of advancement, the successful assertion
of fundamental protected by self-government,
are directly traceable to the operation and influence
of religion through all the ramifications of human
existence and intercourse. The world is not only
better because of these unities which have been briefly
sketched, but, in a true sense, they have poured into
the world its vitality and its germinating and fructi
fying processes. The man who sums up modern
civilization, including all that the word implies as well
as expresses, as the outcome of human reason and
human effort in antagonism to faith, has not even
skimmed over the surface of the phenomena of nine
teen hundred years. There is not a home, a school,
a hall of justice, an institution of learning, a monu
ment to philanthropy or charity, a library, any one
distinctive feature of the present elevation of man
kind, that does not demonstrate the necessity of re
ligion and its dominance in the suppression of
savagery and ignorance and in the uplifting of the
practical toward the ideal. The spires that point
toward the stars and receive the diurnal baptism of
the sun will survive armies and navies, all the essen
tial but deplorable brutalities of government, and will
sentinel the coming ages of peace, order and plenty
under free institutions when the ashes of imperialism
shall have been swept into the waste places of eternity.
THE TRfICK GAMBLERS.
NO one expected that the : profits of track
gambling would be surrendered without a
struggle. The revenues have been large, and
accumulated profits will be used liberally in litigating
the prohibitory ordinance.
The Supervisors have simply put 'into law the wish
of the community. They reflected the public desire
to have the stain erased from the city's fame and
name. They could not restore the good names lost,
the lives blighted, the bread taken from families, the
money stolen from employers, the public funds offi
cially embezzled, to go into the pockets of the idle
and vicious schemers who fatten on the bread and
ruin of others. But the Supervisors could and did
say that for the future this lure shall be removed and
prohibited, and that no more money shall be lost, no
more stolen, no more embezzled, and that the
morgue', prison and insane asylums shall get no more
recruits from the pool-box and books. These vicious
revenues have amounted to thousands of dollars every
day, and nearly every one the price of honor. Let any
one watch the crowds that go to the track and esti
mate how many are drawn there by love of the horse
or a wholesome admiration for a noble sport. Such
are in a minority so small that if they were the only
ones to be present the stand would be almost empty.
The fact is that the lovers of the horse and enthusiasts
in trials of speed and endurance are kept away from
the track by the presence there of gamblers and their
victims. The track has become as much the means
of gambling as the green cloth and box and dealer of
a faro game. No one visits a faro den to admire the
dexterity of the dealer, the watchfulness of the look
out, the color of the cards, or the structure of the
box or table. All these are merely the accessories
necessary to the game of chance. In like manner the
track, the horses, jockeys, starter and judges are
merely necessary parts of a process upon which
money may be laid, to be lost by victims of the
gambling craze and won by the skilled student of
chance.
The prohibitory ordinance will be picked to pieces
ar far as skilled attorneys can do it, and the people
should stand guard over it. They should back up
the Supervisors. They should keep vital the present
condition of public attention to the matter. The
ordinance must have more than a perfunctory defense
in the courts. If it show flaws under the judicial eye
its defense must be such as to compel the courts to
develop and bound and delimit the extent of public
authority over the question, resting in the Board of
Supervisors, to the end that if this ordinance fall
another may take its place securing the same object
and able to stand an assault in the courts.
All the ingenuity that money can employ will enter
the lists against it.. If it stand the judicial test, then all
the craft that greed engenders will be called into play
to evade it. Then will come the necessity of constant
vigilance to smoke out and prevent these evasions
and violations of the law.
The vice has been so long permitted that it has
taken on the character of a fixed habit, and as such
has lived on , the toleration of the community. If it
can be prevented long enough to make its prevention
a habit, there will be little danger of its reappearance.

Mrs. Minnie Adams has been arrested
for the murder of her illegitimate
child, the charge being that she ad
ministered carbolic acid to the little
one. While the ascertaining of the
truth will naturally be left to the courts
any man has a right to his opinion, and
my opinion is that the woman is not
guilty. Even if she is guilty the father
of the child, who deserted her and then
was eager to bring an accusation
against her, is no better. Everybody
knows that the natural tendency of a
child upon finding an object, liquid or
solid, is to swallow it. If the youngster
who died from carbolic acid had found
a bottle containing the deadly fluid he
probably followed the precedents set by
countless generations of his kind and
endeavored to gulp the contents down.
The mother is not of a high order

would hardly have had the thoughtful
ness in buying poison to give a ficti

says that he identifies her, but the
identification given by a policeman may
be an error. His unsupported word
ought to be insufficient to convict. If
the woman is guilty, despite her wrongs
and her griefs, there is no palliation for
her. As yet, however, the astute re
porter and the eager detective com
bined have in no measure convinced the

For many years Evangelist Moody
has been garnering human souls and
has done very well. He is now in this
neighborhood and 1 hope will meet with
his usual success. But with all his en
thusiasm, his ardor, which- seems little
less than an inspiration, Mr. Moody can
afford to talk sense. He spoke the other
night about the Bible and said: "Ac
cept it all or reject every line." To ac
cept every line of the Bible literally is
impossible to the normal intelligence
of many worthy people. In parts 'of it
the Creator of the universe, it seems
to them, is* portrayed as a monster,
cruel, vindictive and small; subject to
the passions of anger, avarice and
vanity. With a reverence for God, the
maker of worlds, I am glad not to be
able to believe'this of the Infinite. Nor
do I think, as Mr. Moody implies, that
the salvation of any soul hinges on in
dorsement of the tale that Jonah was
three days in the belly of a whale, that
blowing on ramshorns ever knocked
down a wall, or that at the bidding of
Joshua the sun stood still. Let Mr.
Moody teach the beautiful morality of
the sermon on the mount and no scoffer
can rise up to condemn. But his dic
tum of literal acceptance is a demand
that people turn not wholly to a better
life, but that in great measure they
turn to heathenism, ignorance and su
perstition. I - would not offend Mr.
Moody. He is not only a gentleman,
but one of the most astute jadvertisers
of modern times.

Most of the vetoes of Governor Gage !
have been admirable, but I wish he
could have seen his way to assisting
the State to make reparation to an in
dividual who had been wronged beyond
the power of word to express. Th;s j
man had been in prison for ten years
for. a crime of which he was innocent.
An effort was made to pay to him as
some slight compensation the sum of
515,000, and while the Legislature ap
proved, the executive would not pass
It. Yet the State owes that man more
than could ever be repaid. Even the,
tender of the pitiful sum mentioned
would be only a suggestion of recom
pense. There should be a law for the
protection of such unfortunates, and
they should be entitled at least to a
sum equal to that they would have
earned in freedom, as well as a sub
stantial pension.

My friend, the cable car conductor
has written a book. j Perhaps the little
volume is not in itself remarkable, but
that it s should have been written by a
representative toller, one to whom the
hours of rest are few and the hours of
labor crowded with vexations, taken in
consideration with the character and
treatment of the chosen subject, seems
to me deeply significant. The conduc
tor is Wallace E. Nevill, and for years
he has attended to 7 his calling' on a
I Jackson street car, thoughtful, courte
ous and apparently absorbed in the
performance of his duties. He has
â¢ termed the book "When the Cable Car
i Stopped," and.it is the relation of a
supposititious dream, in which is ex
ploited a study of cooperation. On the
visionary car he has such* pu^g
as Mayor Phelan, Drs. Hemphill and
Stebbins and Mr. Vining. His theorie,
are unfolded by means of a conversa
tion among these gentlemen, and the
scheme is carried out consistently and
pleasingly; universal co-operation of
course receiving indorsement, ail the
talkers clasping hands td the sentiment
"Brotherhood and Humanity. Mr.
Wallace Nevill does not claim great
originality, but he has grouped ideas in
such a way as to show he iB a carefu
student. The work is of high moral
tone and there is much in it to set peo
ple thinking. This is particularly clear
for the reason that the author is not a
professor of economics, but. one who
earns a daily wage with his hands. If
the people who do not often express
themselves in print' are, pondering over
this great problem, solution may De
nearer than we know.

HIS SONG NOT
INTENDED FOR
VULGAR EARS
Bohemian Joseph D.
Redding Is Angry.
HE SUES MUSIC PUBLISHERS
PRINTED HIS COMPOSITION
WITHOUT ATJTHOBITY.
Joseph Asks to Have the Press
Stopped and to Be Awarded
Heavy Damages for
the Outrage.
A deathless song Is alleged to have been
stolen, both words and music; an. impious
hand has dared to snatch the laurels from
a gifted brow, and that is why Joseph D.
fcedding. Bohemian, musician, bon vivant,
art connoisseur, lawyer and society Idol ,
nurses his wrath In wicked New York.
Eight years ago Mr. Redding paid a ;
visit to Honolulu, and when he returned to
this' city with the scent of the orange :
groves in his hair he sate him down in his
boudoir on a sad. misty San Francisco
summer eve and poured forth hi- soul In i
song. Then he breathed into the verses j
the breath of melody and sang them to ,
his friends, who pronounced them beauti- â 
fdi beyond compare. â  \ -7 - , --Â
For years the song was cherished as nis j
own. It was not intended for vulgar ears, j
upon- whose tympani the soulful sentiment j
and the harmony would fall as seed on
barren ground; but the author sang thÂ» j
tender verses to the select ln Bohemia ana
ADVERTISEMENTS.
at the festal board of the Four Hundred
in New York City, where the poet-mu
sician has made his home for the past
three years. .' â_ _ _â
One day not long ago Mr. Redding
chanced to glance In at the window of a
music store on Broadway and to hi
amazement saw the child of his brain In
print, with the announcement that the
song had been "arranged" by J. S. LlDor
nio. He bought a copy and saw that not
a word had been changed nor a note of
music altered. Then wrote the poet to a
lawyer friend in this city, and yesterday
a suit was filed in the United States Cir
cuit Court against E. MV. Armstrong and
th* Model music store of San Francisco to
enjoin them from continuing to expose the
beauties of his song in print to the coarse
gaze of a hard, senseless world, and to
order the defendants to render an account
of their sales of the said song (if any)
and to pay him damages. .â  , .
The complaint contains a cop> of the
printed words and music and a. -manu
script copy in the author's own handwrit
ing. There are only eight lines, divided
into two stanzas, but they are great, as
will be seen by the following:
A SONG TO HAWAII.
The wind from over the see.
Sings sweetly, Aloha, to me:
The waves as they fall on the sand
Say Aloha: and bid me to land.
The last line of the stanza quoted deli
cately and lngeneously proclaims to the
world the hospitable character of the Al
oha wave. Now, the average wave that
-rolTs and froths in equatorial regions is
not in the habit of bidding the stranger
to land except upon a coral reef or in the
capacious maw of a 20-foot shark. But
the Alhoa wave is different. It Is not only
a welcome, but a wharf and a hotel as
well. One cannot linger long on this de
lightful theme and must pass to the sec
ond stanza.
The myriad flowers In bloom.
Waft Aloha in everj* perfume.
I read In each lovelit eye
Aloha. Aloha! WUI OE!
Observe, the easy manner In which
"bloom" Is made to rhyme with the noun
"perfume" and how gracefully the poet
has availed himself of the license of his
craft as to shift the accent from the first
to the second syllable of the latter word.
For the last line. "Aloha! Aloha! Nui
oe'" criticism has nothing to offer. The
line, no doubt, has reference to each
lovelit eye", in which the poet read the
Aloha and so forth. yyy â â â â â 
At the end appears the following.

AN UNCOMPLETED GIFT.
An Important Decision of Supreme
Court Affecting All Beneficiary-
Societies.
A decision of importance to beneficiary
bodies was rendered yesterday by the
Supreme Court. It was in the case of
the Supreme Council of the" American Le
gion of Honor against Albrecht Gehren
beck et *al. and Jacob Kornahrens, ad
ministrator. The council Issued to one
of its members a beneficiary certificate
for -$3000, which was in favor of the mem
ber's wife. Marguerite Gehrenbeck. She
died a few months before her husband,
and after the husband's death the admin
istrator set up a claim for the money, due
on the beneficiary certificate as a part of
her estate. Gehrenbeck's children by a
former wife contested the claim, assert
ing that the money should go to them. In
the meantime the council paid the amount
Into court. The children by the former
wife obtained judgment, from which the
administrator of the second wife ap
pealed. * "~, : '-.;- V: '
The Supreme Justices hold that the in
terest of the beneficiary is that of an ex
pectance of an uncompleted gift, which,
like a will, is subject to revocation, and
"the beneficiary having died before any
rights had become vested in her, this
mere expectancy died with her. so there
is nothing left for her heirs to succeed
to." Hence the first wife's children are
entitled to the money, and the judgment
of the lower court was affirmed..

HORSES.
Fat Dunne's Survivor Also Remem
bered â Won the Farewell Handi
âFleur de Lis a Factor
in Future Events.
To use a turf expression, "there was not '
much doln' " at Ingleside yesterday. The j
stand contained a scanty gathering of the j
fair sex and down ln the betting ring were I
knots of bookmakers standing about here I
and there, with possibly, in all, about 150
members of the talent. The majority of
these passed through the turnstiles on
complimentary badges. The police were j
very active and the attempts to accept j
bets on the handbook plan were most !
feeble ones. Fearing arrest, the principal
members of the bookmaking fraternity
made no effort to violate the ordinance. '
The fields were small, permitting of five !
straight favorites to catch the eye of the
judges first. "Skeets" Martin piloted three
of the winning horses.
The 4-year-old Opponent was delegated
by popular choice to take the opening mile j
and a sixteenth selling run, which he did j
at odds of 6to 5. Waiting on his company j
until the stretch was reached, Martin ;
gave Kid Weller's horse his head, and he
won easily from Wyoming. Joe Mussle
disposed of the others for the show.
Ab Stemler's mare Fleur de Lis dis
played Improving form in the mile run.
Closing a strong favorite, Llmewater gave
her only a mild argument, being downed
a length at the wire after the daughter of ,
Maxim had led from the start.
The. steeplechase could not get away
from the Corrigan household. McAuiiffe
on Vanity waited until the others were all
out or had fallen, and then challenging
Lord Chesterfield downed that jumper a
length. Huntsman was third. Our Cli
mate would undoubtedly have won had he
not come to grief at the first jump.
Corrlgan's filly Sardine, with a soft spot
arranged for her. was asked to beat a
most ordinary bunch of two-year-olds ln
the fourth event. The race was farcical,
for she had speed to burn, winning in a
canter. Ned Dennis took the place from
Ella Boland.
The "farewell" handicap at one and a
quarter miles was another extravaganza.
Survivor was called on to beat nothing,
and galloped over the top of his field,
leading Sardonic past the wire with
pounds to spare.
Track Notes.
Sardonic ran her last race yesterday. ,
She will be bred to imp. Bassetlow.
"Skeets" Martin will pilot Sardine ln
the stake at Oakland to-morrow, leaving
for the East In the evening. Rutter will

same time.

SUTHERLAND
PROVED TO BE
UNFAITHFUL
Cast Aside Charming
Mrs. Webber.
SUIT FILED IN CONSEQUENCE
DAMAGES ASKED FOR BREACH
OF PROMISE TO MARRY.
:
Widow of a Chicago Physician Re
fuses to Let a Local Capitalist
Tamper With Her Af
â *"â  fections. t <
Through no fault of hers Mrs. Jennie
Webber will not become the bride of Colo
nel W. J. Sutherland, but she demands
$20,000 damages to fill the void in her
abused affections. Mrs. Webber filed suit
against Colonel Sutherland for breach of
promise yesterday afternoon and asked
that judgment be entered in her favor
In the amount named.
The plaintiff In the case is a charming
widow, who arrived from the East in Au
gust last. Colonel Sutherland is. presi
dent of the Holmes Mining Company and
is at present quartered at the Palace Ho
tel. Taking into consideration the sphere
of life ln which both have traveled it is
manifest that an interesting trial will* be
the fruit of the action.
The complaint filed is very brief. It
simply -sets forth that in September of
lS3h, being a single woman and therefore
capable of contracting marriage, Mrs.
Webber accepted a proposal from Colonel
Sutherland and promised to become his
bride. Ever since that time, she avers,
she has been ready and willing to appear
before the altar with the colonel, but he
absolutely refuses to consider her rights
at all and consequently she will make an
effort to make him pay for his perfidy.
A pretty romance is tangled in this suit
for damages. Mrs. Webber is the widow
of a once well-known Chicago physician.
Possessed of some means she decided to
take a trip to this coast and last August
arrived here, accompanied by her little
daughter. She spent a few days at the
Palace and then took apartments at the
Berkshire, where she resides at present.
When she came to this city she brought
letters of Introduction to Colonel Suther
land, who is reputed to be about 50 years
of age and quite wealthy. They soon be
came great friends, often dining together,
and ultimately, as Mrs. Webber states,
became engaged. As evidence of this con
tention Mrs. Webber holds a handsome
solitaire pearl engagement ring, which
the groom-to-be was happy to see her
tv ear until about two weeks ago. They
had a quarrel at that time and Colonel
Sutherland broke the engagement. Then
Mrs. Webber began preparing her plans
to sue him for breach of promise and re
tained H. I. Kowalsky and T. J. Crowley
to prosecute the action.
When Colonel Sutherland heard that
suit was to be filed Mrs. Webber states
that she received an invitation from him
to dinner, but she refused and continued
strengthening her position for the action
ln court.
It is understood that while Colonel
Sutherland admits his friendship for Mrs.
Webber he denies that he ever asked her
to be his bride, so consequently there win
be two sides to the story when it is called
In court for adjudication.
HAS TO DA JUMPED HIS BONDS?
Reported That He Left for Japan on
the Hongkong Maru.
"When the case of K. Toda, charged
with carrying on an immoral traffic in
Japanese girls, particularly relative to a
young girl named Chlyo, was called again
In Judge Conlan's court yesterday an
other continuance for a week was grant
ed at the request of Justice of .the Peace
Groezinger, who heard the testimony.
It was reported yesterday that Toda,
who is out on bonds, had left for Japan
Friday on the steamer Hongkong Maru,
but no notification of the fact was made
to the court.

DR. KILMER'S REMEDIES.
THEIffINEirSPECIATj^
AND HIS GREAT DISCOVERY
The Discoverer of Swamp-Root at Work la His Laboratory.
Hoi to Promptly Cnre Kidney,
Bladder and Uric Acid Troubles.
You May Have a Sample Bottle of This Great
Discovery Sent Free by Mail.
As we are by nature subject to many "
diseases, the only way to guard against
all attacks on our health is to make a
study of our own physical self.
If a peculiar pain attacks you., try to
locate its origin and discover which or-
gan of the body is sick and in need of
attention. !
If the kidneys are at faultâ and in al-
most every case in the failing of our |
health they areâ look well to their res- ;
toration to health and strength.
They are the great filterers of our
body, and, consequently, the purity of
the blood is entirely dependent on their
cleansing power?.
If the kidneys are not In a healthy
condition, the blood becomes impregnat- [
ed with impurities and a decay of the '
kidneys soon takes place. If your desire -
to relieve yourself of water increases I
and you find it necessary to arise many
times during sleeping hours, your kid- j
mj-s are sick. As they reach a more un-
healthy stage, a scalding and irritation
takes place as the water flows, and pain
or dull ache in the back makes you mis-
erable. If your water, when allowed to
remain undisturbed for twenty-four
hours, forms a settling or sediment, or
has a cloudy appearance, you are in the :
grasp of most serious kidney disorder.
If neglected now the disease advances
until the face looks pale or sallow, puffy
or dark circles under the eyes, the feet
swell and sometimes the heart acts
badly.
There is no more serious menace to
health and strength than any derange-
ment of the kidneys.
Swamp-Root is the great discovery of I
A JAPANESE TELLS
OF NATIVE CUSTOMS
SHEGETARO MABIKTJBO AT ME
CHANICS' INSTITUTE.
Delivers an Interesting and Highly
Intelligent Discourse on Chry
santhemum Land and
Its Beauties.
Shegetaro Marikubo, a Japanese, lec
tured before a large audience at the Me
chanics' Institute Library building last
evening. Marikubo has been in the United
States eight years and has attended the
State University at Berkeley. Previous
to his departure from Japan he grad
uated from the Tokio Academy. The sub
ject to which he has devoted the most
study has been philosophy.
Throughout his remarks he interspersed
wit, which with the unique manner of his
expression highly amused his listeners.
The subject of his discourse was "Char
acteristics of Japan." He omitted any
reference to modern advancement in
Japan, but confined himself entirely -to
a history of the prevailing usages. He
touched upon the Japanese idea of
beauty, and its idea of celibacy, marriage
and divorce. â
"Few Japanese remain single, he said.
"It is their nature to marry, and they are
careful In the selection of one who is to
be their partner in life. Beauty, of
course, is admired," but it is not regarded
as an element of high quality or of good
ness." -'"â â¢"*â "__ .
The queer requisites for those who are
about to unite their hearts and hands
brought smiles to many faces in the au
dience. Marriage he declared to be the
momentous event of life, and every ef
fort is made to thwart a union which is
likely to prove unsuccessful. Among the
preliminaries of engagement is an ex
change of courtesies between the parents
of the contracting parties, which consists
in most cases, of five barrels of wine and
five species of fish. The bride shaves
her eyebrow as a sign that her heart is
to be the property of her future husband
forever. Silence is observed at the mar
riage feast, and nothing but the clinking
of goblets breaks the stillness tor some
time. The bride is attired in white, and
purple is* prohibited, being the symbol, ot
a fading flower and not representing joy
or life The rule of absolute submission
must be observed closely by her.
â¢â¢Divorce " said Martkufeo, "is consid
ered by the Japanese to "oe disgraceful
and degrading. Once united, husband and
% "'fe wiH suffer much to prevent a dis
ruDtion of the bonds of matrimony. Di
vorce is seldom heard of in the country,
and Generally marriages -are happy ones.
The ground.-, on which a dissolution may
be granted are much the same as the
American law, on the subject.
MRS. ADAMS ARRAIGNED.
Attorneys Expect to Clear Her of the
Charge of Murdering Her Child.
Mrs. Minnie Adams was taken to Act
ing Police Judge Barry's court yesterday
morning. and after Sergeant Duke had
sworn to the complaint charging her with
the murder of her child she' was instruct
ed and arraigned. Attorney J. P. Swee
ney on her behalf asked for a continuance
till next Thursday, afternoon. As there
â was no objection by Prosecuting Attor
ney Carpenter the Judge granted the re-
GUt-St
Q Mrs. Adams begins to show signs of the
awful strain upon her and looked hag
gard and drawn as she sat patiently
waiting in court till her case was called.
She seemed listless and indifferent and
took no interest in what was going on
around her. . ._-_____
Attorney Sweeney has associated with
him Attorneys Gullfoye and Caldwell and
Dr. Kilmer, the eminent physician and
specialist, and will be found just what
is needed in cases of kidney and blad-
der disorders and Uric Acid troubles
due to weak kidneys, such as lame
back, lumbago, catarrh of the bladder,
gravel*, rheumatism and Bright's dis-
ease, which is the worst form of kid-
ney disease.
It corrects inability to hold water and
promptly overcomes that unpleasant
necessity of being compelled to go often
during the day and to get up many
times at right.
The mild and extraordinary effect of
this great remedy is soon realized. It
stands the highest for its wonderful
cures, and is sold by druggists in fifty-
cent and one-dollar bottles. Make a
note of the name, SWAMP-ROOT, Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, and remember
it is prepared only by Dr. Kilmer & Co.,
Binghamton, N. T.
Swamp-Root has been tested in so
many ways, in hospital work. in private
practice, among the helpless too poor to
purchase relief, and has proved so suc-
cessful in every case that a special ar-
rangement has been made by which all
readers of The Call, who have not al-
ready tried it. may have a sample bot-
tle sent absolutely free by mall. Also
a book telling more about Swamp-Root
and containing some of the thousands

received from men and women who owe
their good health, in fact their very
lives, to the wonderful curative proper-
ties of Swamp-Root. Be sure and men-
tion the San Francisco Sunday Call when
sending your address to Dr. Kilmer &
Co., Binghamton, N. Y.
he says he has no fear of the result. He
asserts the defense has discovered the
woman who purchased the carbolic acid
at â¢ hr's drugstore last Sunday night
and will produce her at the proper time.
She was not Mrs. Adams, he says, and
Policeman Herlihy was mistaken in his
positive identification.

CZAR'S ACT MORE
CRUEL THAN WAR
Russification of Finland
Going On.
Special Cable to The Call and the New Tor-
Herald. Copyrighted, ISM, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, March IS.â While the
apostles of disarmament are packing
their trunks for Holland, the author of
this pious conference is committing in
Finland an act more brutal than war.
By solemn treaties the Finns have been
since ISOS bound to Russia by the same
rule. Their own successive Czars have
renewed the pledges, and the Finns
have shown their gratitude by loyally
keeping the .ice.
Suddenly this Czar orders a Russifl
ration of the country, and it is being
flone quietly, but forcibly, as though it
were another Poland. A monster pe
tition Is now preparing from Finns in
different parts of the world, and if the
Russian police refuse it access to
the throne it might possibly prove
an interesting document at the interna
tional peace conference.
Peace conferences, by the way,
have become epidemic in England.
There is one every day or so, where
professional philanthropists and ama
teur speakers find an indulgent audi
ence and do very little harm.
So long as the Government main
tains Its policy of military prepared
ness America, should cherish no illu
sions 'on the subject of disarmament.
America needs an army of at least 100,
--)00 regulars and a supplementary mili
tary school besides West Point. Its
navy, should be doubled, and when it
has got thus far then it will be in a
position to command peace, for peace
3oes not come to those who merely talk
about it. y
OUTBREAK OF RIOTOUS
STRIKERS AT SKAGUAY
Town Placed Under Martial Law
, After an Attack on a Railway
Camp.
VICTORIA, B. <'Â March 18. â The
steamer Amur, which arrived this morn
ing, reports a riotous outbreak of rail
road strikers at Skaguay. The strikers
made an unsuccessful attempt to drive
non-striking workmen from Camp 1.
White, the ringleader, led a body of men
to Camp 1, where Dr. Whiting, the rail
road surgeon, and a few men stood guard.
White advanced in front of the party,
parleyed for a few minutes and then
â¢sprang for Whiting, who knocked him
Sown with a rifle, breaking the weapon
and stunning White. The rioters then
dispersed. White will recover.
A hundred men have been sworn in to
isslst the Marshal, and the town is un
3er martial law. The saloons and gam
bling houses have been closed.
A movement is on foot in Skaguay to
-harter a steamer and send the strikers
jvho are causing trouble here, home. Most

GREEN CANDY IS
NOT ACCEPTABLE
Present Promptly Sent
to the Police.
Special Dispatoh to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 18.â Mrs. Julia
A. Mays of 240 Fifth avenue to-day re
ceived by mail a small box of inferior
grade candy, most of it of a green color,
accompanied by a card bearing this in
scription: "To Mrs. Julia Mays', from
Mary, March 17." The woman knew of
no one named Mary whose presents
might assume such form, and she sent
the box, contents and wrapper in which
it was received to the police station by
a hallboy, together with a message that
she thought the candy was poisoned.
Police Captain Price put three de
tectives on the case. At the conclusion
of the day's labors they made their re
port behind closed doors and no part
of it was made public.
"The box came in the early mail,"
said Mrs. Mays, 'and was brought to
my room by the hallboy. 1 noticed that
the writing was perpendicular, but nec
essarily disguised. The box was lined
with green ribbon of a cheap quality.
On top of the candy lay a shamrock
and card.' The first thing that struck
me* as queer was the small quantity
and then the poor quality of the candy.
Coupled with the fact that I knew no
one likely' to send such a gift nor any
one who might see significance in mak
nig me a present on St. Patrick's day,
these made me distrustful, and I imme
diately sent everything to the police."
Mrs. Mays said she had not noticed
at what station the package had been
mailed; neither had she thought to
compare the card with the writing on
the paper.
"I have no violent enemies," she de
clared. "I don't think there is a soul
alive wishful of my death. I don't say
that I believe the candy was poisoned,
j but I am not going to take any
chances."
RETJNION OF PIONEERS.
Sonora Would Entertain the Tuol-

JAMESTOWN, March 18.â Preliminary
steps have been taken with the object of
having the annual picnic and reunion of
the Tuolumne Association of San Fran
cisco held next June in Sonora. The
project has been under discussion since
the completion of the Sierra Railway to
that city, and is received with enthu
siasm in all parts of the county. B. T.
Booze, general passenger agent of the
Sierra Railway, says his company will
grant low rates for the occasion, and it
is reasonably certain the Southern Pacific
will do likewise.
Scattered over the State are thousands
of men and women who formerly resided
in this county who have love for old
Tuolumne and will gladly avail them
selves of low rates and. travel by rail to
visit their old stamping grounds.
FIRE AT WELLINGTON.
The Town Opera House and Other
Buildings Burned.
VANCOUVER, B. C. March 18.â A spe
cial from Nanaimo says: While 300
dancers were enjoying themselves in the
Wellington Opera-house early this morn
ing some one in a candy store below over
turned a lamp and tne whole building
was ln flames in a few minutes. The
dancers fled from the building in confu
sion. The flames succeeded in reducing
the opera-house, Grant Jessop's drug
store, a barber-shop and Henderson's con
fectionery establishment to ashes before
they were got under -control. The total
loss is $20,000, about half covered by in

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 19. 1899.
LIEUTENANT LANE
IS IN DISGRACE
Accused of Scandalous
Conduct.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. March IS.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Charges
of scandalous conduct have been pre
ferred against Lieutenant Clarence E.
Lang of the Second Artillery which will
probably result in the court martial of
that officer, and may lead to a divorce
suit. Lieutenant Lang's domestic
affairs have caused the department
much trouble in the past.
Lieutenant Lang has been ordered to
report to the colonel commanding,
Washington Barracks, pending action
by the War Department on formal
charges which have been made against
him by Major John S. Sewall of the
Engineer Corps. The specific charges
are conduct unbecoming an officer and
gentleman and scandalous conduct
prejudicial to good order and military
discipline. The specifications which
Major Sewall- has also prepared set
forth that Lieutenant Lang, who is a
married man, has been living for the
last five days at a fashionable boarding
house in X street, this city, under the
name of Mr. Daniels, and that a woman
not his wife has been with him, who
has passed as Mrs. Daniels.
Major Sewall lives at the same board
ing house. He was at the Military
Academy at the time Lieutenant Lang
was a cadet there, and recognized his
old schoolmate, but was astonished to
find he was traveling under an assumed
name. He knew that Lieutenant Lang
had married the daughter of a commis
sary sergeant at West Point, and, while
making due allowance for the few years
that have passed since he was ac
quainted with Mrs. Lang as a girl, he
recognized at once that the woman
with the artillery officer was not his
wife.
Major Sewall promptly reported the
matter to his superior officers, who ad
vised him to put his charges into writ
ing, which he has done. He also spoke
to the landlady, and "Mr. and Mrs.
Daniels" are no longer under the .same
roof with Major Sewall.
The matter was taken up at army
headquarters yesterday and an order
was issued directing Lieutenant Lang
to report to General Miles at 10 o'clock,
when he received instructions to report
without delay to the colonel command
ing, Washington Barracks. "Mrs. Dan
iels" left, unaccompanied by "Mr. Dan-
iels."
Lieutenant Lang came to this city on
Monday last on sick leave. He is eli
gible for promotion, and the intention
was to order him before the board in
this city for examination for that pur
pose. An effort is being made to in
duce him to resign so as to avoid the
scandal of a court martial. It is re
ported here that Lieutenant Lang
separated from his wife about a year
ago. !

McKINLEY AGAINST
HIS OLD OPPONENT
The Tickets for Nineteen
Hundred.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, March 18.
The meeting of President McKinley,
Senator Hanna and Mr. Piatt in
Thomasville, Ga., the Belmont din
ner in New York and the early discus
sion of the place of holding the national :
conventions Indicate that the Presi
dential campaign has opened a year ;
ahead of the usual time.
The friends of Reed, too, gave a din
ner, said to have been for the purpose
of launching his Presidential boom.
The distribution of patronage has, as
usual, made a good many enemies for
the Presidential incumbent, and these
dissatisfied place hunters and their
friends propose to rally round the Reed
standard. Failing in this it is generally
believed they will fall into the Roose
velt camp.
Mr. Hanna has doubtless observed
this, and it probably explains why he
has summoned a council of the friends
of the President to take Immediate
I stops to head it off and prevent it from
becoming dangerous. As soon as Sen
ator Hanna returns from Thomasville,
which will be about the Ist of April, it
is understood he will call a meeting of
the executive committee of the Repub
lican National Committee. The meeting
will take place in Washington and the
machinery of the party will be set in
motion.
In this way Senator Hanna hopes to
forestall any opposition to Mr. McKin
ley that may be developed. While Mc-
Kinley and Bryan are strong favorites
for the Republican and Democratic
nominations there is a big minority in
each organization that is working
against them. General opinion hero is
that if the national conventions should
be held within the next few months
both McKinley and Bryan would prob
ably be nominated without serious op
position, but the events of the next
twelve or fourteen months may change
the situation materially.
"Mr. Bryan's friends," said a Bryan
man to-day, "will certainly control the
i Democratic National Convention next
year. They will organize the conven
tion and appoint the committee on con
tested seats. It is safe to say that
there will be contesting delegations
from New York and every State where
the men in control of the party ma
chinery refuse to indorse tho Chicago
platform of 1896. We will not admit
delegates that do not stand squarely
â¢upon the Chicago platform, as the
point will be made that they are not
Democrats. A majority of the conven
tion will have absolute control of this
matter and can act as it sees fit. Un
less the anti-Bryan people can capture
a clear majority of the delegates to the
Democratic National Convention they
will not be able to defeat Mr. Bryan's
nomination. Two-thirds rule or no
two-thirds rule, we do not propose to
let the tail wag the dog."

SAMOAN AFFAIRS
ONLY PATCHED UP
Whole Question Not Yet
Settled.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, March IS.â Dealing with
the report that an arrangement has
been arrived at* on the subject of Sa
moa, the Morning Post to-day says:
"It is a mistake to suppose that the
whole question is in a sure way to sat
isfactory settlement. This is impossible
while the Berlin act remains in force,
and, as the present would be a most un
desirable moment to make a change, it
may be assumed that things will be
patched up for a while. Just now, when
the relations between Germany and
Great Britain and the United States are
the most friendly in many years, it
would never do to run the risk of a
sudden rupture by getting matters in
disorder in Samoa. Perhaps the diffi
culty will solve Itself. At any rate, the
Australian federation should assist in
the solution, as not only will the federa
tion increase the Interest of Australia
in Somoa, but, in any diplomatic nego
tiations in the future, * federated Aus
tralia will greatly strengthen the case
for Great Britain."
The Indian Government bill imposing
countervailing duties on bounty-fed
sugar has caused a flutter in Radical
circles. It is frankly and avowedly a
protectionist measure. The Secretary
of State for India, Lord George Hamil
ton, in the House of Commons declared
that the object of the bill was to pre
vent the indigenous trade of India from
being undermined by subsidized foreign
products.
This, the Radicals point out, is a pro
tection pure and simple, and they ex
press fear that it may the thin edge of
the protection wedge, and that it may
eventually be transplanted to Great
Britain with quite as much reason as in
its adoption in America.
The Daily Chronicle remarks! "There
Is a strong Impression that this Indian
duty is intended as a feeler to an Eng
lish duty, and the whole free trade posi
tion is imperiled."
Henry Labouchtrt In Truth calls
the bill a "contemptible and Iniquitous
measure," and says: "The Government
is going to try an Indian reactionary
protectionist policy, which It would not
dare to Introduce m home. The bill
may be the firm step toward a general
system of protection, which will doÂ«
cide our claims of* supremacy once and
for all." â 'â -,-*"-

NO BOOK BETTING
ON PARIS RACES
Layers of Odds Driven Out iQ
the Interest of the Paris
Mutuels.
PARIS, March 18.â A feature of the week has been the decision of
the authorities to put a stop to book betting on racecourses, in the in
terests of the paris mutuels. Two per cent is levied for charities upon
money which goes through this machine and this is held to be in some
sense a justification of its existence. Owners and heavy bettors object
to the mutuels because one cannot tell what odds are likely to come
out and without an occasional coup, made by betting, few owners could
afford to keep up their racing stables.
Encouraged, possibly, by the recent decision of the English House of
Lords, the bookmakers and their patrons are thinking of going to law
to ascertain whether book bets are really contrary to legislation. An
act of 1891 forbids "bookies" to offer to bet with all comers, and it is
desired to obtain a judicial declaration as to the exact meaning of those
words.
Meanwhile a delegation of the fraternity- waited on the Prefect of Po
lice with two suggestions: One that the ring be established as in Eng
land; the second, that a special book be issued with stubs, which would
form a check on transactions and enable taxes to be collected for chari
ties, as in the paris mutuels. They contend that in the latter case
the receipts for the poor would be doubled.

IN WINDSOR'S RUINS
NEW YORK, March 18.â Through
the incessant rain to-day, their
efforts hindered by a choking
smoke that arose from the half
quenches ruins, more than 200
men from the building, police and fire
departments sought, but with only
half-satisfactory results, for bodies of
persons believed to have perished in
yesterday's fire at the Windsor Hotel.
Most of the time the smoke was so
dense that the workmen could scarce
ly see their hands before their faces,
and the heat from the mass of debris,
glowing red in places, held the rescuers
almost beyond its limits. Besides, the
remnants of the walls left standing
were so shaky and threatening that it
would have been dangerous to allow !
the men to work about the mass of
riveted j iron and brick. Efforts were
concentrated on clearing away the de
bris, removing weak walls, drilling the
chimneys and other parts of the walls
for blasting and making the way safe
for the men to dig in the ruins for the
bodies.
No more bodies were taken from the
seething mass of ruins to-day. The
latest estimate to-night ls sixteen dead,
sixty-six missing and fifty-seven In
jured. It is believed the men will be
able to proceed with the grewsome
search to-morrow with more satisfac
tory results. Several engines had kept
their stations all night long, throwing
heavy streams of water on the ruins.
Occasionally a mass of flame would
struggle up from some unnoticed spot
like a bubble and burst away as the
streams played on it. Through the day
explosions of gas punctuated the con*
tinual pumping of the engines.
The scene of devastation in the im
mediate vicinity of the fire can scarcely
be Imagined. Broken and blackened j
windows, wrecked doors, smashed rail- |
ings, dirt and general debris surround I
almost every house. Countless thou
eands of spectators, pouring from every
street and avenue and from every tran- j
sit line that passed near the scene of j
the great holocaust and from the pri- J
vate carriages as well, packed the sur
rounding thoroughfares all day, press
ing as close to the ruins as the restrain
ing police lines would permit, and
straining their eyes in the hope of
catching sight of some ghastly part of
the spectacle. One hundred policemen
held back the crowd.
At intervals the lifting smoke showed
the fire engines, puffing almost solemn
ly, and their silent attendants at their
sides. Beyond, where all eyes sought
to reach, rose two gaunt columns of
masonry, all that remained standing of
the hotel.
Warren F. Leland, the proprietor of
the Windsor, had somewhat recovered
to-day, but was still in a feeble condi
tion. He is as yet unable to account
for the origin of the fire.
It was learned to-day that Elbridge
T. Gerry had the building and furni
ture that belonged to the hotel fully In
sured, and even the annual rental, for
which he indemnified himself with poli
cies aggregating $75,000. Mr. Gerry car
' ried policies aggregating $595,000 on the
building and had insurance for $120,000
on the furniture. In addition to this j
Mr. Leland had policies aggregating
$100,000 on his own furniture in the ho

POSTUM CEREAL.
ABOUT COMPLEXIONS.
A Subject Nearest a Woman's
Heart.
"What a good fresh color you have!"
said my friend Mrs. S. one morning
about a year ago. "Do tell me what
you have been, doing to yourself?"
- ' I laughed and said, "If I should tell
you, you would hardly believe it, and
yet I want you to look at me again and
pee if you really appreciate what a
great difference there is between my
present looks and how I was two or
three months ago."
"Well," she said, "my dear, I don't
want to flatter you, but really I don't
know when I have seen as beautiful a
complexion as you have, and (pinching
my cheek) 1 believe it is all natural."
"Yes." I said, "it is all natural. It is
a complexion made on the inside and
not on the out." "Well, do tell me
about it," she said. "I am a perfect
martyr to dyspepsia and feel almost
discouraged, having tried so many dif-
ferent kinds of medicines, and got no
relief."
I said, "You will have to stop coffee
entirely!" "Oh, bless your heart, â¢ I
can't do that," she said. "Well, that
is what I thought, but Dr. said,
'You will never know the difference in
leaving off coffee if you will use Pos-
tum Food coffee, being sure that it is
properly boiled to bring out the flavor,'
and he added, 'there are certain ele-
ments in the food coffee that I know
from experience with patients really
go to build up a strong, healthy ner-
vous system, and that is the foundation
for true health.'
"So I went at it, and I want to em-
phasize the necessity of following the
directions in making Postum, for when
I first began to use it I did not heed
. them strictly, and the beverage was al-
most a failure, but I concluded that the
fault must be mine, and tried again,
with the most gratifying results."
A week or two later I met my friend
. again, and she scarcely looked like the
same woman. "I am feeling so well."
she exclaimed, "and I owe you the
thanks. Why, when I was talking to
* you before I had such a headache and
a burning distress in my stomach,
while all the time my liver was dis-
turbed, I was constipated and the kid-
neys more or less affected. All the
.world looked blue," and she laughed
heartily as she told of the old troubles,
* "but they have gone now, and to-day
everything is rose colored. How can
I thank you enough and I can tell you
now that I was. in danger of losing my
position (she is a deputy in the offlce
of the land commissioner at the State
House). I don't understand how peo-
ple can get into and keep along with
such habits, but they don't really know
what the trouble is. That was the case
-with me, and I suppose It was the
case with you, was it not? ."."*',
I said, "and, by the way, I want to tell
you another item. My baby boy, two
years old, was a puny, fretful, crying
child until 1 began feeding him on
lightly toasted bread broken into Pos-

NOVELIST GUNTER
PROBABLY PERISHED
NEW YORK, March 18.â Archibald Clavering Gunter, the well-known
novelist, was a patron of the Windsor Hotel, and it is feared by friends
who have not seen him since the fire that he lost his life with his child.
Colonel Thomas Ochiltree said to-night: "Mr. Gunter was in my
apartments an hour before the fire, and I have no doubt that his body
will be discovered in the ruins of the. hotel. He was a very large, stout
man and was a constant sufferer from asthma, and would find it difficult
to make his escape through the smoke."

No estimate can be made of the pre

stood the flames and lie hidden In the
embers and wreckage of the great ho

$200 000 and the total will run up some
where near $1,000,000. How much has
been picked up and carried away can j
never be known nor can all ever be re
covered.
Mrs. Nancy Kirk, who lost her life,
tnd her daughter, Miss Mary Kirk, had

either his wife or daughter, supposed
to live in Lordsburg, N. M.; Aaron
Bischoffshaven, Germany.
The work of removing the debris was
begun late to-night, when a gang of
about 200 experienced men were
put to work. The timbers and bricks
were so hot and the smoke still so thick
that the work progressed slowly. Gas
oline tanks and electric light plants
were placed in various places. The men
devoted most. of their time to the Fifth
avenue and Forty-sixth street sides. As
they cleared away the outer portion of
the debris, they found portions of the
ground floor still intact. Up to a late
hour the only articles found to. reward
the laborers were three battered trunks
partly filled with clothing.
In front of the hotel, where the bal
cony had stood and where the struc
ture had been eight stories high, there
was a pile of bricks and twisted iron
supports forty feet high. The wall of
this part fell neither in nor out. It col
lapsed and fell upon Itself. With its
fall, which was early in the fire, all
hope for any one left in the building
was gone. How many had managed
to reach the doorway when it fell will
not be known until the mass ls cleared
away. That will be several days.
The men who are clearing the wreck
will work in shifts and be watched by
the police and a corps of inspectors to
guard against the possibility of mak
ing way with any valuables they may
find. Nearly every guest who was saved
lost expensive jewelry or jewels. Some
lost diamonds to the value of many
thousands.
In front of the building a one-story
frame house has been erected. This
will be the office of the contractor and
the police headauarters also. To this
all valuables will be taken.
When the hour of the change of shifts
arrives the men coming off duty will be
called into this place and searched for
valuables. No laborer will be per
mitted to leave his work and go out
side the lines or communicate with a
person inside the lines while at work.
The last will and testament of Benja
min E. Jones, executed May 17, 1894,
was found this afternoon. It disposed
of a quarter of a million dollars in
property. Attached to it was a codicil
which provides for the disposition of
ether property. The will was turned
over to the building department. Near
the same spot some railroad bonds were
picked up. They were wet and badly
burned. What bonds they were could
not be determined.
Some of the bodies in the ruins may
be recovered Monday or Tuesday. It
will take a week to get at some of them,
and perhaps it will take twice that
long to get at those in the cellar.
Every preparation has been made for
handling of bodies. Wagons with
stretchers will be inside the lines and
the Coroner will take charge of the
bodies at once.
The home of Helen Gould was a point
of interest to-day to sightseers. Hun
dreds who managed to get inside the
lines waited around in hope of catch
ing a glimpse of the woman whose
charitable acts yesterday and to-day
were so spontaneous. The police threw
a guard around the house. It had been
slightly damaged by fire. Miss Gould
and her brother Frank occupied the
house Friday night although they had
permitted it to be turned into a hos
pital and morgue during the fire. To
day three men were slightly hurt while
working about the walls. They were
taken to the Gould home and waited
there until the arrival of an ambulance.
CARDINAL HATS FOR
IRELAND AND CORRIGAN
NEW YORK, March 18.â special cable
to the Sun from London says:' Cardinal
Vaughan is reported to have received in
formation leaving little doubt that the
Pope has decided to raise Archbishops
Corrigan and Ireland to the Card in aI.
and accord a similar honor to a British
prelate. It is not likely the promotion
will be announced in the coming con
sistory, because the programme of that
function was settled several months ago.
Nevertheless, if it is permissible to ap
praise such matters by the ordinary mun
dane standard, the chances are small for
either Archbishop Ireland or Archbishop
Corrigan to receive a red hat from Leo
XIII. ' The Pope can scarcely live until
the next consistory, and It Is almost im
possible that he will be in this world when
the summer consistory should be held.

DEPOSITORS JOE
WEARY OF DELAY
Threaten to Sue Union
Bank Directors.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 18.â executive
committee of the organized depositors
of the Union Savings Bank have de
cided to make a formal demand for 25
per cent of the amount due depositors
just as soon as there is a legal board
of directors to manage the affairs of
the Union Savings Bank. This was
decided on at the meeting of the com
mittee to-day. The delays that are oc
curing have angered the depositors
and these 1500 victims of the bank are
now clamoring for their money and
demading that the stockholders be
sued. Twenty-five per cent of deposits
will be demanded in thirty days from
the time of notice. If the coin is not
forthcoming the directors will be sued
and asked to pay their proportion and
costs Only those financially respon
sible'will be sued. It is believed such
suits will cause the directors to take
speedy action. .
The writ of review asked by C. P.
Breslan of Judge Lorigan's action in
appointing a board of trustees will
come up before Judge Beattie Monday,
and after this decision is rendered it
is not believed there will be a hitch over
a directorate.
BARTON'S PRACTICABLE
FLYING MACHINE
The Airship Starts on Wheels and
When Afloat Is Driven by-
Clockwork.
NEW YORK, March 18.â special cable
to the World from London says: A prac
ticable flying machine has been invented
by Dr. Barton of Beckenham, near Lon
don. The World correspondent was present
Thursday at the first exhibition of Bar
ton's airship. The experiment was also
witnessed by Colonel Yorke, representing
the military ballooning department.
The Woolwich experimental machine ls
a huge toy twenty-one feet long, depen
dent on a complicated bamboo arrange
ment rigged fort; and aft with aerophones,
a sail in front and a rudder In the rear.
Above is an elongated balloon. The ship
starts on wheels, and when afloat is
driven by clockwork.
After some trouble the ship rose in the
air and made two trips about a quarter
of a mile each. The motions were some
what erratic, but the Inventor explained
that "this is not a fair example of its
capabilities. The strong, gusty wind pre
vailing subjects it to a severe test.
Colonel Yorke considered the apparatus i
uncertain.

LOUBET GENEROUS
TO THE RUBBLE
Causes Prosecutions to
Be Dropped.

don Bennett. '
j PARIS, March 18.â remember
,the agitation which signalized the elec
tion of M. Loubet, some 250 arrests be
ing made in all during the fortnight.
These manifestants had been making
their appearance a dozen per day be
fore the Police Courts, generally re
ceiving fines from 10 to 15 francs, when
orders came from headquarters to drop
the prosecutions. This was at the in
stance of M. Loubet, who further ob
tained a remission of the fines paid by
those tried before he intervened.
President Loubet has been sitting for
a photograph which will be distributed
to the Comites throughout France. 36,
--000 proofs being struck off and dis
patched as rapidly as possible. The
Government has decided that each
Maire shall keep on show portraits of
the different Presidents, so as to form
a sort of gallery of heads of the re

are as yet in possession of photographs
of M. Carnot only, and a lot remains
to be done. .-.__, -_

The question of Americanism, though
disposed of from the standpoint of doc

NOT TOO SICK TO
INDULGE IN WIT
Pope Leo's Jo^e at tl>e Expense of
th)e Cardial Chamberlain aod
F^is Silver Hammer.
LONDON, March 18.â The Pope has just indulged in a joke at tfie
expense of Cardinal Oreglia di Santo Stefano, who, as cardinal cham
berlain of the church and prefect of the congregation of ceremonial, has
to make sure that the Pope is dead by tapping him three times on the
forehead with a little silver hammer. "When Cardinal Santo Stefano
was summoned to the Vatican in hot haste on the first news of the ill
ness of the Pontiff, he put the hammer in his pocket, as it might be
needed. The story reached the Pope's ears and afterward, receiving the
Cardinal, his Holiness thanked him, commented on his foresight, and
said: "And, as a token of our sincere appreciation of your thoughtful
attention, we ask your Eminence to accept this little golden hammer as
a souvenir of our recovery."

Paris.
Special Cable to The Call and the New Tork
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, March IS.â There Is a rich Odes
sa merchant"" who was decorated by M.
Faure during the latter's visit to Russia,
and desired to have a Franco-Russian al
liance all his own. He came to Paris to
get a wife, and found much more than he
bargained for. He began his researches
in Montmartre, where he had little diffi
culty in meeting a young lady who seemed
entirely to fulfill his ideal. Indeed, most
men's ideals can be discovered without
much trouble on the sacred hill. The Rus.
sian merchant's ideal told him she waa
perfecting her artistic education.
To cut a long story short, the Russian
proposed, was accepted, the banns were
published at a suburban mairie, the knot
was tied and monsieur and madame went
to the latter's apartments, where cham
pagne was opened to celebrate the joyous
occasion. The wine went to the gentle
man's head sooner than it usually does to
Russians, and he was dropping asleep
when he was startled by the apparition
of a big man armed with a revolver, who
merely wanted the newly made benedick
to sign a check for 60,000 francs. The
Russian preferred to die rather than sign
the check, and finally the accomplices
left, with the Russian's ready money and
valuables.

Francis Truth's Flattering
Offer to Travel and
Heal the Sick.
Says He Is Well Satisfied With
San Francisco and Does
Not Care to Leave.
CROWDS ARE GETTING LARGER.
Oruto-es, StioVs, Thick Soled Shoes, Ear
Trumpets, Trusses, Spectacles and
Last Doses of Opium and Mor-
phine Are Accumulating
on His Walls.
The remarkable cures now being ef-
fected by Healer Truth at 440 Geary
Btreet, San Francisco, have attracted
widespread attention, the result being
an Immense number of inquiries as to
his practice from all parts of the coun-
try.
Among those who were attracted to
Healer Truth's marvelous operations
Was a well-known business man and
manager. The latter called upon the
healer a few days since and made him
an offer to travel and exhibit his rare
healing powers on the public platform.
For one year's contract Healer Truth
was offered $30,000 and expenses for
"himself and family.
"I refused the offer," said Healer
Truth to a reporter yesterday. "I did
not refuse It because that sum of money
has no attractions for me, but merely'
because I preferred to take my chance
In San Francisco. I told the gentleman
who was desirous of having me travel
tinder his direction that San Francisco
was good enough for me, and that I had
faith enough In her people to Indulge
the hope that my refusal would cost m
no loss in my practice. I do not care to
have outsiders make money off m
powers. I therefore resolved to remain
In this city and continue my practice
which is increasing to a remarkable
degree."
Healer Truth's reputation has become
go widespread and the visits to his of-
flees so frequent by sufferers that he
has found it necessary to enlarge his j
accommodations. With this end .in
view some four apartments are being
added to his present quarters, which
Will be devoted to consulting and wait-
Ing purposes. The new apartments will
be richly finished and elegantly ap-
pointed with the latest and best appli-
ances known to the builder's art.
' Healer Truth's chambers are the
Mecca of unfortunates who, failing to
find relief from physical ills after years
of trials elsewhere, are astonished at
the miraculous results that follow their
meeting with Healer Truth. Many crip-
ples have entered his office and within
a short time have been enabled to
throw away their crutches with cries
of "Hallelujah!" The main consulting
room of the establishment is decorated
with crutches of every length and style,
ear trumpets, trusses, spectacles, etc.,
end they speak volumes in praise of the
really remarkable work in which Healer
Truth is engaged.
Among the wonderful cures effected
by Healer Truth may be mentioned
that of Miss Dora Gardemeyer of 216
O'Farrell street, who was cured of total
deafness after one or two treatments.
The daughter of Mrs. J. M. Brooks of
Fresno was almost totally blind and
suffered excruciating torture from rup-
ture. She consulted Healer Truth and
was cured in a few weeks. Gilbert
Mansfield, a music teacher of 289 Va-
lencia street, was cured of nervous pros-
tration, and Charles Harper of 149 Tay-
lor street, who carried about for many
years a useless, withered leg, was en-
abled within a few weeks to throw
away his crutches and go to work.
Many similar cases of cures effected
by Healer Truth might be mentioned.
Some of these are: William H. Barden,
441 Geary street, cured of the morphine
habit and paralysis of the optic nerve;
Miss Maggie Gale-wan, whose voice was
lost, recovered it again after only three
treatments; Frank A. Bemis, suffering
from lost vitality, weak back, failing
memory, was permanently cured in a
short time; Mrs. J. Leavezi of 322 Sev-
enth street, after wearing crutches for
lameness caused by a disease of the
knee Joints, was enabled to throw away
her crutches the first time she met
â¢Healer Truth and go home unaided;
Mrs. S. McKeon, 2110 Steiner street, San
Francisco, suffered from a cracking jaw
for a year or more and found it impos-
sible to thrust out her tongue. She was
cured after a few treatments. ,
Although the local business of Healer
Truth is increasing enormously, he finds
time to pay attention to hundreds of
leases of patients living outside this city.
He accomplishes cures in all parts of
the country. Among some of his absent
cures may be mentioned H. R. Frost of
Los Angeles, who was cured in a brief
period of a bad case of catarrh. Mrs.
Walter Miller of 98 Main street, Broad
Brook, Conn., was cured of paralysis of
the optic nerve and after years of blind-
ness is now, owing to Healer Truth's
treatment, able to see again. Mrs. Sarah
â¢H. Bester of Salt Lake City was cured
after suffering for fifty years from an
aggravated form of female weakness.
The young son of Mrs. Jane Murphy of
407 Clementina street, who .was lame for
years, was able to walk erect after one
treatment. Mrs. C. B. Barden of 77
.Pleasant avenue, San Jose, cured of a
tumor in the breast and who was to be
operated upon by other physicians for
cancer. yy
Every mall from abroad carries with
lt to Healer Truth the thanks of suffer-
ers who were fortunate enough to come
under his treatment. While Healer
Truth does not aim to exercise his pow-
ers without remuneration, he has, nev-
ertheless, among his patients some poor
' people whom he treats free of charge.
It is this liberality of treatment,
coupled with an affable manner and re-
suits which are gratifying, both to pa-
tients and healer, which â¢ have ? made
Healer Truth famous in this city and a
â¢Â»owÂ«r la the medical world. i y -.--
LIEUT. J. M. NEALL
HAS RETURNED FROM
HERMOSILLO, MEX.
Reported Last Night at Presidio.
Will Stand Trial and Make
Good All He Owes.
First Lieutenant John M. Neall, Troop
B, Fourth United States Cavalry, has re
turned to face his accusers like a soldier
and a man. He reported at the Presidio
shortly after 10 o'clock last night. Ever
since the lieutenant left, over a month
ago, his friends have been actively at
work in his behalf. They have been quiet
ly endeavoring to ascertain what could
be done. It was shortly discovered that
nothing could be hoped for unless the of
ficer returned and gave himself up to the
military authorities. Some tin* ago, when
Mrs. Neall wrote, to Major General Shaft
er asking that he use his influence ln be
half of her husband, he replied he could
not promise anything, until the lieutenant
came back. As soon as Lieutenant Neall's
friends learned this they at once commu
nicated with him. and it was then the
officer determined to return and take his
trial and its consequences.
Lieutenant Neall has been in Hermo
sillo, Sonora, Mexico. As soon as he re
ceived the advices of his friends telling
him that nothing could be done until he
came back he at once left his Place Â°
hiding. He arrived here yesterday after
noon on the -:45 train from the south. He
came directly to the city and went to the
Buss House, where he was met by his
friends Never was an officer extended a
warmer or more sincere welcome. It was
the true kind of Christian friendship.
There was sympathy and support .ln
everything that they did or said Lieuten
ant Neall remained in consultation with
bis friends until after 9 o'clock when he
took a carriage and drove out to the Pre
sidio. Mrs. Neall and her children were
there awaiting him.
Lieutenant Neall had very little tp say.
He stated that he had returned and that
through his friends he would make good
every cent he owed. Regarding his future
plans he can say nothing at present.
Much depends upon his trial, which, he
says, he has returned to stand. This will
no doubt be commenced some time this
weekâ that is, if there is to be oneâ for
everything depends upon the charges that
Colonel Compton may prefer against
Lieutenant Neall. The case as it now
stands, according to a well-informed of
ficer is this: Lieutenant Neall has been
absent without leave, for which military
offense he must suffer. As for any short
age, he is prepared to make that good.
Under these conditions there is nothing
that can be done. Besides it is positively

ostentatious charitable work has been
favorably commented on during the past
years by those who have learned of it.
The society's success has been due to

TWO RUNAWAY BOYS.
Police of Oakland and This City
Searching for John Mills and
Harry Tucker.
John Mills and Harry Tucker, two lads
of 12, left the "Nursery," corner of Mis
sion and Twelfth streets, yesterday morn
ing and have not returned.
The father of young Mills called at the
Chief of Police's office last night and re
ported their disappearance. He described
them as being attired in overalls, dark
coats and gray hats. As Tucker sings in
the choir of the Church of the Advent in
Oakland it was thought he was over
there. An investigation disclosed the fact
that the boy had not been there, as there
was no rehearsal yesterday.. The police
department of Oakland has been notified
of the boys' disappearance and are
searching for them. This will make the
second time Tucker has left the home. - â
The Organ Is a Nuisance.
Charles B. Tufts was convicted by
Judge Ccnlan yesterday .of maintaining
a nuisance in his store on Pine street,
near Kearny, in the shape of an organ
worked by electricity. He was ordered
to appear for sentence to-morrow. The
Judge had personal experience of the fact
as to whether the organ was a nuisance.

known that General Shafter will extend
to the unfortunate officer every possible
leniency.
There is much that tends to mitigate
the offense of Lieutenant Neall. First,
the mere fact that he has returned is ln
his favor, and that everything will bo
made good is also a mitigation. More than
all else is the fine record of the past that
Lieutenant Neall has to his credit. Gen
eral Miles, commanding the army, has
complimented him for his efficiency, and
even now is interested in his behalf.
There never was a better officer in the
service, and bo his faults what they may
his previous unblemished record and ster
ling qualities will have much to do in ex
tenuation of his punishment. It is gen
erally thought at department headquar
ters that Lieutenant Neall will be lightly
dealt with. Officers higher in authority
than Colonel Compton are deeply interest
ed in his behalf. 1

Mechanics of Oakland and San Fran

of Eight Hours.
OAKLAND, March 18.â mass-meet
ing of carpenters of this city and vicinity
was held to-night at Y. M. I. Hall and the'
building trades outlook for the coming
summer was discussed. The meeting was
held under the auspices of Oakland Union
No. 36, United Brotherhood of Carpenters
and Joiners of America. Prominent
among the speakers were Harry Saun
ders, aspirant to the appointment of La
bor Commissioner, and District Organizer
Marlsbury of the brotherhood.
Both touched upon the benefits of or
ganized labor and the advantage of unity
and harmony. Both argued that to Im
prove the future the present must be dis
turbed, and it was announced that on and
after May 1 the carpenters and joiners of
San Francisco will enforce the wage
schedule of $3 per day of eight hours^ and
Oakland mechanics who go to San ."_ ran
cisco seeking work must have the union
card. Mr. Marlsbury, while recognizing
that there has been a general depression
and hard times for the past twelve
months, predicted that during the coming
summer and the next two years a large
amount of work will be done.
There will be three big government jobs
In the vicinity of San Francisco that will
require not less than 400 carpenters. He
urged mechanics to bury past differences
and foster the union, for grudges only
tend to disrupt. The speaker admonished
his listeners against strikes. "I do not
like them," he said, " and they should be
resorted to only as a final means of se
curing justice where all others have
failed." Â«.'Â«__--
The' local union at present has a mem

night hold another meeting of a social
nature, to which ladies will be Invited.

Solution of the difficulty. .
â  Miss Aime E. Gariyau, principal of Bar
rington School, voiced the sentiments of
many teachers last night. She, in com
pany with hosts of people, believe the city
should pay the men and women charged
with the education of the children- She is
opposed to the proposed compromise on
the ground that if it is effected the teach
ers will not realize 15 cents on the dollar.
She says the teachers are indignant at
being asked to compromise; that they
ehould not be asked to help merchants
collect their bills. In discussing the situ- j
ation Miss Gariyau said:
The teachers instituted legal proceedings !
to compel the Board of Education to issue
them their salary demands for the months
of ember and December, 1898. A prin
ciple was Involved. Services were rendered
ior these two months. The city of San
Francisco appropriated for the School De-
! partment for the fiscal year IS9S-S9 the sum
of $1,03., 000. The Supervisors in allowing
this amount were assured that {900,000 was
needed to pay the teaching force as it stood
when the levy was made. The Board of
Education had a moral right, if nothing
else, to give the money to those for whom
it was granted.
The teachers are â¢ confronted with the
fact that there is at present ln the treasury
to the credit of the school fund for the
months of November and December about
fSO.OOO. while the salary demands alone for
those months foot up 1186.000. The litigation
to far has come to naught. The legal tan
gle is bewildering. "Deficits," merchants'

and the dire Intimation that unless we com
promise we may never draw another sal
aryâthese are ideas fraught with such
terrible Import that we are glad to with
draw from all litigation.
The teachers cannot draw the $M>,ooo be
cause the merchant creditors have claims
amounting to more than $70,000, which they
are protecting with an injunction. Judge
Seawell tells teachers and merchants that
bills contracted in excess of the one-twelfth
of the revenue for any one month are il
legal claims and cannot be paid with the
public moneys. We know that our salar
ies are legal claims. The merchants con
cede that about â¢ one-half of their claims
cannot be collected legally. They do not say,
however, which half. Instead they propose
to raise the injunction, -allow, the teachers
$3", 000 and take the other $35,0.t0. provided
the teachers assign their claim to the No
vember and December salaries to a trustee,
who, in the event of the city at some future
day making good the teachers' salaries for
these months, shall pay to the merchants
the (33,000 that the law will not allow
them to collect.
There are about one thousand teachers
interested in these proceedings. About two
hundred did not Join in the suit. Of the
remainder many do not understand the le
gal phraseology that is presented to them
think they are going to get one-half of
their salaries. As a matter of fact if they
accept this proposition, allowing for heavy
expenses, they will get perhaps 15 cents on
the dollar.
There are, however, a large body of teach
ers, who are justly indignant . that they
should be even asked to discuss a compro
mise. These teachers do not want to be
misunderstood. They are not fighting the
merchants and never'have been, neither are
they battling to help these men to collect
their bills.
We feel that either we are entitled to our
November and December salaries or we are
not. There i.- no middle ground. That the
money for these salaries has been diverted
to other channels we are convinced, but to
establish this fact and to get a judgment
can be accomplished only with great loss
cf time and money and at the sacrifice of
our peace of mind. All of this would tend
to impair our professional useful!
We are willing to let the great and gen
erous city of San Francis. decide whether
she will accept services from her teachers
for a period of two months and then repu
diate the payment of their salaries.

TRIES TO HANG HIMSELF.
James Mackey, While Drunk in His
Cell, Attempts to Take His Life.
James Mackey, a one time wealthy man
and proprietor of a sailors' boarding
house on the water front, attempted sui
cide last evening by hanging himself to a
beam in his cell at the City Prison.
Turnkey Hickey was attracted to his
cell by his groans and immediately en
tered to ascertain the cause. He found
Mackey hanging from the beam by means
of a bandana handkerchief, and cut him
down. The prisoner, was unconscious and
purple in the face, and had he been left
there five minutes more would have died.
Mackey was hurriedly taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital and attended by Drs.
Tormey and Rumwell. Tne prisoner had
been brought from the California street
station earlier in the day and placed in
the drunkards' cell.

JAMES RILEY CAME TO CELE
BRATE ST. PATRICK'S DAY. .
He Met a Well-Dressed Stranger and
Was Induced to Play Poker
With the Usual
Result.
The number of men who come from the
country on a visit with money in their
pockets and Imagine they can beat a
bunko man at poker Is surprising. Al
though cases are published in the press
from time to time, the bunko men con
tinue to gather In victims. After coming
to the conclusion that they have been
swindled, the victims apply to the police
for assistance in recovering their money.
When the bunko men are arrested the
victims get a return of a portion or the
whole of the money from friends of the
prisoners and depart for home. This re
sults in cases against the bunko men
being dismissed for lack of prosecution.
A young man. accompanied by a friend,
called at the office of the Chief of Police
yesterday morning. He said he had been
robbed by bunko men of between $300 and
$400, and he wanted the police to get back
the money. When asked for his name he
refused to give it, remarking that the
police could get his money without his
name. He was informed that the Police
Department was not a collection agency
and unless he gave his name and partic
ulars of where and how he lost the money
no action would be taken.
He consulted with his friend, and then
said his name was James Riley and that
he was a ranch hand In Sonoma County,
which may not be true. He had saved up
between $300 and $400, and thought he
would come to the city and celebrate St.
Patrick's day. He celebrated ln good
style, and yesterday morning, when he
was walking along Market street, a young
man, well dressed and jj smooth spoken,
accosted him. The young man wore a
shamrock, and said he had arrived Friday
morning to spend the day. Riley and his
new acquaintance had a few drinks to
gether, and then he was steered to a room
in a house on Kearny street. Where he
was Introduced to "the Judge" and three
other men. After chatting for a few min
utes the ''Judge" suggested a game of
cards, and Riley's friend took a hand,
winning considerable money. Riley be
came excited and was soon Induced to join
in the game. Luck was dead against him
and he foolishly parted with all his
money. _
Captain Bohen detailed Detectives Sil
vey and Crockett on the case, 'but the
chances are that the bunko men will not
be found. The two sleuths are under the
impression that the bunko men will not
realize the fact that they have done any
thing wrong, and unless the papers say
that they have they will remain in the
city and allow themselves to be gathered
in. Bunko men, as a rule, are not built
that way. - '

For this breach of polite etiquette Singer
had the fair maid arrested and charged
with "felonious embezzlement. The case
came up before Judge Mogan yesterday.
Singer, who. is a little, tailor who bites
his 'finger-nails and parts his hair from
brow to collar, explained in a highly sea
soned Teutonic English his courtship and
engagement to the fair and blushing Ray.
A "match-maker" led the tailor to the
home of the lady, and on , the same even
ing of the meeting, after a mutual hand-,
shake, the subject of marriage was imme
diately broached. The inopportune en
trance of the family put a stop to the
love-making. However, six days after
the first meeting Ray Cerekle had prom
ised to let the tailor support her for the
balance of her life. .â¢
"On Thursday evening we were. about to
become engaged,' explained Singer, "and

would you like to have to bind our en
gagement?' 'Well, it looks nice to bind
an engagement with a diamond ring,' said
Miss Cerekle, and so I went the next day
with her brother to buy one. Her brother
said he could take me to. a place where I
could get a good ring reasonable. The
ring I bought is worth about $40. I paid
$60 for it. After we were engaged I used

Trial Package of a Remarkable Remedy to Con-
vince People It Actually Grows Hair.
Prevents Hair Falling Out, Removes Dandruff, Restores
Prematurely Gray Hair to Natural Color, Stops Itching
and Restores Luxuriant Growth to Eyebrows,
Eyelashes and Shining Scalps.
_-â¢â ':-â  MRS.. J. .8. WEED-
Those who are losing their hair or have part-
ed with their locks can have it restored by a
remedy that is sent free to all. A Cincinnati
firm has concluded that the best way to con-
vince people that hair can be grown on any
head is to let them try it and see for them-
selves. All sorts of theories have been ad-
vanced to account for falling hair, but after
all. it Is the remedy we are after and not
the theory. People who need more hair, or
are anxious to save what they have, or from
sickness, dandruff or other causes have lost
their hair, should at once send their name and
address to the Altenheim Medical Dispensary,
616 Selves building, Cincinnati, Ohio, enclosing
4 cents in stamps to cover postage, and they
will forward prepaid by mall a sufficient free
trial package of their remedy to fully prove
its remarkable action in quickly removing all
trace of dandruff and scalp diseases and forc-
ing a new growth of hair. The remedy is not
a new experiment and no one need fear that
it is harmful.' It cured , John Bruner, Post-
master of Millvllle, Henry County, Ind., and
he strongly urges every one to try it. A
Methodist preacher, Victor A. Falgaux of
Tracy City, Term.. was perfectly bald on his
forehead for many years, but has now a fine
'growth. Mrs. C. W. Castleman, 843 Main st.,
Riverside, Cal.. reports her husband's shiny
head now covered with soft, fine hair, and she,
too, has derived wonderful benefit. Among
others who have used the remedy are Geo.
Dlefenbach,- general agent of the Big Four
Railroad, of Dayton, Ohio, whose wife was
entirely cured of â¢ baldness.
The president of Falrmount College, Sulphur,
Ky., Prof. B. F. Turner, . was bald for thirty
years and now has a splendid growth of hair
from having tried this remarkable rtmedy^
Write to-day for ft free trial package. It .will j
to take her out to the theater and to sup
per, but she always would take her sister
along. I did not like her to take her sis
ter with her. I didn't want to marry the
whole family, and I told her so. 'I don't
care,' she said, and then the family got
cross and I went away and the engage
ment was broken off.'
Miss Cerekle followed Singer on the
stand, and looking the man she was once
willing to call her very own straight In
the face swore she wouldn't marry him
because he was so cheap. "Every 5-cent
piece he spent he noted down in a book,
said Ray. "and when he spent over 15
cents he would mark it down in great big
red figures so that every time he would
open the book it would be there staring
at him. When he took me to the theater
we would go up in the gallery, and after
the theater he would send me home alone
in the car. so as to save his car fare. Our
natures did not agree," concluded Mis*
Cerekle. "He was too cheap for me, and
so I broke the engagement.
When Ray left the witness stand
the Judge paused for a moment
and then with becoming dignity made the
new law of the betrothal ring that is sure
to make a boom in the social editor's en
gagement column.

was dismissed on a similar- promise. Both
Judges said that fines would be imposed

HER HAIR RETURNS
Remarkable Action of a New and
Wonderful Cure for Baldness.
Lady Prominent in G. A. R. Circles
Regains Her Hair, Although
Past Fifty.
Mrs. J. S. Weed, treasurer of Swartz Corps
No 91, W. R. C, with headquarters at New
Albany, Bradford County. Pa., owes a luxuri-
ant growth of hair to a new and valuable
remedy discovered by a Cincinnati dispensary.
In response to their offer to send free trials
of their preparations Mrs. Weed used the
remedies and although she was past fifty years
of age, at.a time in life when people Imagine
their baldness is hopeless, her hair grew out
with astonishing luxuriance, much to her sur-
prise and delight. Mrs. Weed kindly consented
to permit her photographs to be sketched, one
taken some time ago when she was premature-
ly bald and a later one taken recently show-
ing the beautiful effects of this remarkable
hair grower.
The remedy also cures itching and dandruff,
sure signs of approaching baldness, and it
also restores gray hair to natural color and
produces thick and lustrouo eyebrows and eye-
lashes. By sending your name and address to
the Alterheim Medical Dispensary. 616 Selves

CHANGE OF CLIMATE
WONT CURE CONSUMPTION
The Slocum System Is Needed.
A Curative Medicinal Treatment Founded on Modern
Scientific Truths Is More Potent
Than Air Alone.
FREE TREATMENT FOR LUNG WEAKNESS.
If those of our readers who reside in
the most highly favored sections of this
country, where the climate is healthy
and Invigorating, with a dry and tonic
atmosphere, will look about them, they
will see a greater or less number of
their friends and neighbors dying of
consumption, while many others have
already been carried off by that dread
malady.
These deaths have occurred from
time to time amid the refreshing prai-
rie breezes of summer; in the fair and
mellow days of autumn, and also in
the dry and sunny seasons of a south-
ern winter.
Such deaths amid such favorable
surroundings afford positive and con-
vincing proof that climate alone will
not cure consumption; that neither
pine-laden breezes nor bracing mount-
ain air will restore weak lungs or build
up a constitution that is being under-
mined and broken down by the insid-
ious germs of a fatal disease.
But, on the other hand, many thou-
sands of testimonials from grateful
people all over this country, who have
been cured by the Dr. Slocum System
of Treatment, and are to-day in the en-
joyment of perfectly restored health
and strength, afford the most convinc-
ing evidence that this treatment, aided
by favorable climatic conditions and
surroundings, is a positive cure for
Consumption, Asthma and all other
chronic diseases of the Throat, Chest
and Lungs.
Therefore, those who go to the
mountains, the seashore or to southern
climates, as well as those who already
reside in such favored localities, should
not fail to take the Dr. Slocum System
of Treatment if they wish to derive the

full benefits of favorable climatic con-

The Dr. Slocum System of Treat-
ment (consisting of Four Preparations)
is both medicine and food. The medi-
cines used in it allay the cough and
lung Irritation, heal the soreness and
subdue the pains in the throat, over-
come shortness of breath, improve the
appetite and digestion, and bring com-
fort, rest and refreshing sleep, while
its food properties are building up the
constitution, enriching the blood and
infusing the sufferer with new life and
vigor.
No single remedy will accomplish al!
this, but the Four Remedies embodied
in the Dr. Slocum System of Treatment
will. More than a quarter of a century
has been devoted to perfecting this
System of Treatment; every indication,
every symptom in Consumption and
other diseases of the Throat and Lungs
has been carefully studied in the de-
velopment of this Treatment; therefore
those who take it and give it a fair
trial certainly avail themselves of all
that modern science and skill have to
offer for the cure of Consumption and
all forms of wasting diseases.
Dr. Slocum's faith in the efficacy of
his System of Treatment is so strong,
and his interest in the welfare of hu-
manity so great, that he will cheer-
fully send his complete System of
Treatment (Four Preparations) FREE
to all sufferers who ask for it.
Write the Doctor.
Simply write, giving your full name
and address, to Dr. T. A. Slocum, Lab-
oratories, 96 and 98 Pine street, New
York City, stating that you read this
article in The San Francisco Call, when
the - FOUR FREE PREPARATIONS
will be sent you, together with free ad-
vice adapted to your case.

The Testator recited that some of the per-
sons who might be entitled to legacies under

' In America, Australia and New Zealand, and
* it contained the following clause: "I hereby .
declare that even' person entitled to a legacy ,
under this mv will, shall within a period of ;
three years from the day of my death, send I
; . in to mv trustee or trustees a claim (In writ- j
ing) for such legacy, and any person who.
shall not send In such claims, as aforesaid,
shall absolutely forfeit all benefit which he or ]
, she might have otherwise claimed under this i
' my will, and the legacy hereinbefore be- :
I mieathed to him or her shall be dealt with
1 as a lapsed legacy." And the Testator dl- !
* rected his trustees, as soon as conveniently
. might be attar his death, to cause advertise- ,
ments to be inserted ln newspapers, requir- |
I ing all persons entitled to legacies to send in \
their claims.

which shall have been sent in within said j

BUCK CANNOT COLLECT.
A Special Attorney Loses His Fees
Under the Law.
S. M. Buck sued*"the city of Eureka,
Humboldt County, for a large sum _0I
money for services as attorney in two
cases. In one some Chinese sued the city
for big damages for the action of its citi
zens in running out the Chinese residents
nearly twenty years ago. The other case
was that of the prosecution of Barnej
Croghan. The demand of the attorney
was g for $10,000, but a jury awarded him
$4700. The case was appealed by the city .
It was shown the attorney's work was
done on an implied contract, the City
Council passing a resolution engaging
hI I?'was also shown that in the year to
which he was engaged there was no ap
propriation by the city to meet "ieJoWl
gation. and on this point the Supreme
Court says: v:*' , â te +v,_t-_
"It should have been learned if there
was enough in the appropriated revenues
to meet the obligation, for if there was
not there will be no liability resting on
the city and the claimant will have no
right to a judgment in any torn. )}' J* 111 **-
the point is not new. the Supreme Court
has frequently to reiterate It, because of
difficulties arising out of municipalities
overreaching their finances and attempt
ing to pay one year's bills out of another
year's revenues. â

CHOYNSKI WHEN A BOY.
q -TT^ HE above picture of Joe Choynski was taken when the heavy- Â©
_ j weight pugilist was matched to fight Jim Corbett to a finish. The Â©
Â° I battle was held on May 30, 1*"89, in a barn near Fairfax, but it was Â©
O 1 stopped in the fourth round by the referee, when the scouts who Â©
8-*- were on the lookout for the enemy reported the Sheriff and his Â©
Â© deputies were coming. "-'/*;â¢.. /â ',". -.-.V, &
Â© The contest was then postponed, and . the second meeting was held Q
Â© on June 5 of the same year on a barge ywhich was anchored in Car- Â©
Â© quinez. Straits, near Benicia. *" After a hard fight, . which lasted twenty- Â©
Â© seven rounds, the referee, Patsey Hogan, - decided in favor of Corbett. Â©
Â© Choynski has had several hard fistic engagements since then. In Aus- Â©
Â© tralia he faced Joe Goddard, the "Barrier Champion." on two occa- O
O sions and lost. On February 10, 1891, he was knocked out by Goddard Â©
Â© in the fourth, round of , the most ferocious battle that had. ever taken Â©
Â© place ln the Australias. Choynski cut Goddard'a face into ribbons and Q
Â© knocked the big fellow down several times, but was unable to stand the Q
Â© dreadful pace which was cut out by "the Barrier Champion." The sec- Q
Â©ond time he met Goddard was on July 20 of the same year in Melbourne Â©
O for the Australian heavy-weight championship and $10,000. This was a O
Â© repetition of the previous fight, and the Californian again suffered defeat Q
O in the fourth round. Goddard was so weak that he could not stand on his Â©
Â© ' feet after the referee had counted Choynski out. 77^ 7777/ Â©
Â© Ten years of fighting has not seemingly taken the wind out of Choyn- Â©

Â© his fight against McCoy he will immediately 'Â»-;ue a wide-spread chal- Â©

THE MELBA MATINEE
OF ROSSINI'S " BARBER"
Ellis Company Gave an Industrious Per
formance of the Old Farce-Opera.
MELBA AS ROSINA.
.--,â â 3 HE Grand Opera House was
good to gaze upon and sweet to
sniff yesterday afternoon. It was
.J a Melba matinee and the women
of this and the surrounding counties
attended in a crush. A bargain counter
could not have attracted a fairer crowd.
Men were few and yards between, and
the wineroom apothecaries yawned and
slumbered even between acts. It was
ladies* day with. a vengence.
The opera was "The Barber of Se
ville," but it was Melba, I fancy, more
than the opera that drew the throng.
"The Barber" is a good old comic
stand-by, but at this o'clock it is not
what you Would call a popular piece.
Only when some great singer romps
through the part of Rosina does It
make its appeal to the public; and even
BY ASHTON STEVENS. .
then you will notice that the largest ap
plause is given to the interpolations.
There are gems in the Rossini music â
gems graceful, difficult and comic, and
a large measure of melodic satire; but
the pages and pages of colloquial pas
sages, semi-recitative in character, are
deadly dull and absolutely painful to an
English speaking audience. There were
times yesterday when the whole audi
ence seemed to sleep. * The first curtain
went down- to no applause at all and
the handful of men in the back rows
filed out mournfully for their cigarettes
and consolation.
The truth is that the farce around
which Rossini's music is woven offers
little fun to the modern palate. We
have better books and as little horse
play in the worst comic operas that
are builded here in America. The plot
of "The Barber" is hopelessly hopeful;
the dialogue, even when you have mas
tered the Italian text, is far from bril
liant; the situations are banal and
slow. Horse play of a kind unknown
to the modern stage â horse play in
which the game* of "tag" and the
spanking of sundry gentlemen with the
flat of a sword are potent features â
the only hope. And even this, with
the best regulated cast, is not always
a success.
So, after all, it comes down to the
matter of music and the singing. No
one could And fault with the acting
yesterday afternoon. It as indus
trious, incessant. But It was only the
singing that counted, and not all of
that, for at least half of the music with
its thin, trickling orchestration, is mo
notonous and meaningless. "The Bar
ber of Seville," sawed off to vaudeville
dimensions, would. I dare say, make a
lively entertainment; but in' its entire
ty there is too much for a good joke.
Melba's Rosina is not new to San
Francisco. "We heard it on that me
morable night when war with Spain
was declared and the Spanish Rosina
introduced "The Star-spangled Banner"
in the music lesson scene, and the au
dience went daft with enthusiasm. So
Melba, as you already know, is very
good in this part, very alert and girlish.
As there is only one other female char
acter, and that a subsidiary one, Rosina
stands little chance of becoming tire
some. She shines nearly all the time
by right of sex and contrast. Melba
makes her very playful and very, sim
ple. She seems- to enjoy the Irresponsi
bility of the part. She acts with glee
and she sings the embroidered music
apparently with the artlessness of a
canary. Her "una voce poco pa" was of
course faultless, and in the music les
â¢ son, where everything Is ad lib., she
ranged from Lucia's mad frills to the
"Suwanee River." She sang no less
than five pieces in this scene, so great
was the applause. "In Vano" and
"Mattenati," ' by Tosti, and Bohm's
"Still wie die Nacht" gave delightful
opportunity in boudoir singing.
Pandoflni took Bonnard's role of Al
maviva, singing with considerable
humor, but not always with tonal in
tegrity. Bensaude for the sixth time
in six consecutive performances sang
the barytone part. I will wager he
doesn't regret to-day being Sunday. His
Figaro was jaunty in conception, and
his phrasing and enunciation in the
fleet music were admirable. Boudour
esque was the Basilio, distinguishing
himself especially in the "Calumny"
song, and Rosa really managed to get
a little fun out of the tiresome Bartolo.

A NOVELTY IN DIVORCE.
The Courts Find a New Position for a
Receiver.
Henrietta Anderson of Los Angeles sued
her husband, William H. Anderson, for
divorce and maintenance. * She complained
he was of a cruel and a morose disposi
tion, and that he had deserted" her, going
to New York. The cruelty, she said, con
sisted of actions and accusations instead
of violence. The lady asserted that her
husband is rich, owning valuable proper
ties in Los Angeles and also in New York,
but that he would not support her and
her invalid daughter and minor son. In
the court below the Judge found the cru
elty complained of, while painful to the
lady, was not of such a nature as to
warrant the granting of a divorce. How
ever, his Honor decided that the husband
must support the 19-y e Â«-Â° ld _Â£& Snrt
daughter, the minor son and the wife, and
$150 per month was allowed.
That the order of court should be ob
served and the interests of the wife ana
children preserved the court adopted a
course that is somewhat unusual in di
vorce cases. He appointed a receiver to
attend to the community and other prop
erties in the southern part of the State.
As might be expected, the husband ap
pealed to the Supreme Court, but his ap
peal was of no avail, as the judgment and
order of the Judge of the lower court were
affirmed.

Rupture Is Curable.
Startling Assertion by a Well
Known New Yorker.
Cites the Case of Wm. A. Berry as
Absolute Evidence.
Dr. W. S. Rice of 41SH Main street, Adams,
N. V., says that any kind of rupture can be
cured at the patient's home without the slight-
est pain, danger, operation or detention from
MR. WM. A. BERRY. Bristol. N. H.
daily work. He gives the names and addresses
of several hundred prominent people whom he
has cured, one of which, William A. Berry of
Bristol, N. H., will serve to show the work-
ings .of this wonderful plan. Dr. Rice has
devised a new system that holds any rupture,
no matter how large it is, and at the same
time causes the ruptural opening to grow to-
gether and become solid flesh and muscle. He
explains the system fully in a book which he
mails free to all who write. Mr. Berry is a
business man and well known manufacturer
of Bristol and had a difficult rupture, for
which he had tried electricity, spring and
other kinds of trusses, belts and various treat-
ments without benefit.
He had .been told by all who fitted trusses
that he could not be cured and that a surgical
operation, while not a certainty but extremely
dangerous, was the nearest approach to a
cure. As Mr. Berry had already paid out over
a hundred dollars for treatment without the
slightest benefit he was somewhat discouraged
against trying the new Rice method, but final-
ly summoned sufficient courage to make one
more effort. Mr. Berry says of the cure. "It
is complete; the severed muscles are securely
healed. It is eighteen months since I stopped
treatment and not a sign of rupture have I
had since notwithstanding the fact that I have
done all kinds of work with impunity"â
experience will undoubtedly Interest everyone
who is ruptured, and readers should write to
Dr. Rice for his free book. Write to-day and
investigate this' method that assures a com-
plete and permanent cure of any kind of
rupture.

CLOSING HAYS
OF THE BRANDES
MURDER TRIAL
Accused Suspected
His Wife.
HIS TESTIMONY CONCLUDED
PROSECUTION THINKS BRANDES
HAS BEEN CORNERED.
The Trunk With Which He Accounts
for the Noises Could Not Have
Been Drawn Down the
Stairway.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March IS.
"William A. Brandes. charged with the
murder of his little daughter, has been
evidently cornered by the shrewd prose
cution. He was again on the witness
stand to-day in his own behalf and made
extravagant use of his forgetfulness and
refused to answer vital and material
Questions on cross-examination.
Both he and the woman who is accused
with him have' testified that the noises
which neighbors had heard on the night
-Lillian is alleged to have been terribly
beaten were caused not by blows and the
hurling of* Lillian's body against the
walls but were made "while Brandes was
drawing the girl's trunk downstairs into
the basement. Both have declared that
this trunk is longer and wider than the
stenographer's desk in front of them.
Now the prosecution proposes to show
that the trunk could not have been taken
down the stairs, as it is wider than the
hallway.
Brandes to-day admitted that he was a
â¢\swearing and cursing man," but he de
nied that he swore at Lillian on this oc
casion. "I was swearing at Mrs. Brandes
"and the boy at that time," said .mess.
Deputy District Attorney Melvin here
confused Brandes.
"Why, I thoueht you had already told
us that Mrs.- Brandes was in the parlor
â with Mrs. Godfrey?" said Melvin. inquir
ir.glv. Witness assented, and replied:
"Yes. but I mean I was cursing to my
self. I frequently did this."
Brandes denied that he asked Herschell
McDonald, a Berkeley newspaper re
.porter, to "be easy on him in his write
' tip." In fact, he didn't remember Mc-
Donald. In brief, Brandes denied every
statement that the prosecution has shown
him to have made subsequent to the al
leged murder.
Continuiner. he said that he never sus
pected Lillian had taken the missing 515.
"Whom did you -suspect?" inquired
Juror Furry.
â¢The reply proved a stunner.
"1 Â«uspected my wife," said Brandes.
â¢*i was very reckless about laying money
down, and she had taken it before."
Attorney Melvin here again thought he
saw- an opportunity to clear up the re
lations existing between the two accused
murderers. He asked:
"Is Mrs. Etta Brandes your wife.
Witness cringed in his chair and looked
at his attorneys, one of whom, Sawyer,
vigorously objected. _
"This is misconduct upon the part of
the restrict Attorney." said Sawyer, "for i
he knows well what the answer would be
and this man is on trial for murder."
A lone argument followed and Judge
Ha.i again advised witness that if the
answer, to the last question should tend j
to degrade hint he need not respond,
whereupon Brandes, regaining his com
posure, said he did not wish to answer it
then.
"And," continued Brandes, now recall
ing his slip of the tongue, "I wish to cor
rect what I said a few moments ago. I
said 'my wife;' I meant to say 'Mrs.
Brandes.' "
Brandes was next shown the photo
graphs of his dead daughter and declared
they did not resemble her, as there were
more bruises depicted than he. had seen
on her face.
"Isn't it a fact that the mark, on the
forehead was made when you struck your
daughter with a piece of hose?" asked
â  Mr. Melvin sharply.
Witness quickly responded negatively
and denied that there had been a piece
of hose about the house at the time.
"Isn't that piece of hose now in the
possession of your attorneys?" inquiring
ly continued Melvin. "Witness again "did
riot know."
This practically ' ended Brandes* trying
ordeal and the trial was continued until
next Tuesday, at which time, the defense
* announces, it will introduce but one or
two more witnesses.- The prosecution will
thereafter put in its rebuttal-
BARNEY VINDICATED.
No Cause to Remove Him From the
Receivership.
OAKLAXD, March 13.â The petition of
E. C. Sessions for the removal of A. S.
Barney as receiver of the Highland Park
and Fruitvale Railway Company came
up for hearing before Judge Ogden's de
partment of the Superior Court yesterday
morning. Mr. Sessions was the only wit
ness who appeared against the receiver.
After a lengthy hearing the court de
cided that upon the evidence no act of
Mr. Barney during his administration
of the affairs of the company made him
subject to criticism, much less was there
any cause shown for his removal.
Mr. Sessions' attorney asked leave to
dismiss his application, which was grant
ed. The outcome of this matter is that
Mr. Barney is exonerated from all the
charges made against him 'by Mr. Ses
sions.

Two Schoolboys in
Serious Trouble.
ONE LANDS IN A PRISON CELL
ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE
GOOD BOYS.
Samuel Stewart and Jack McChesney
Start on an Industrious Ca
reer of Crime Which
Promised Well.
Oakland Office San Francisco CalL
90S Broadway. March IS.
Samuel Stewart, 14 years old, and Jack
McChesney, a year his senior, are not
the good little boys that their parents and
acquaintances thought. Nearly three
weeks ago these two schoolboys left their
homes, and enough facts were discovered
to show that their sudden departure was
premeditated. The lad? were of a roman
tic turn of mind and had been well
brought up. The police and the Children's
Society were notified of the lads' depart
ure, but were unable to learn anything
until this morning, when a dispatch from
Woodland stated that McChesney is in
jail for stealing a shotgun and Stewart
had made his escape from the Constable.
This happened last Sunday, but the ar- j
rest was not made till Wednesday, when !
the boys were put off a freight train at
Davisville. McChesney was taken before j
the Justice, pleaded guilty and was held I
to answer before the Superior Court on a
charge of burglary. The Stewart boy is
supposed to be beating his way back to i
this city.
The two lads after leaving home, ac
cording to the Davisville Constable, start
ed on a tour of crime, and when arrested
were evidently preparing to arm them
selves for the purpose of self-protection. j
Some ammunition and provisions were
stolen from the farm of Charles Cufts.
between Sacramento and Davisville. and
on the same day a cabin at Sheep Camp .
was robbed of provisions. Last Sunday
they stole a shotgun from A. Fissel, near
Davisville, and they were beating their
way toward Oakland on a freight train
when they were arrested. The Stewart
boy got away from the Constable and hid
in the willows near the Putah Canal.
The news of the boys' adventures was a
great surprise to those who were seeking
for them. They had never run away be
fore and both have enjoyed good reputa
tions. An investigation by the detectives
revealed the fact that one of the lads fre
quently stayed away from home till very
late in the night, but no suspicion appears
to have been attached to his behavior. The
Stewarts have only lived in this country
for a few months, and as soon as they ar
rived their boy made some acquaintances,
the evil effect of which is now apparent.

PARKS WERE
FAVORED IN
THE ELECTION
Submission of Propo
sitions Probable.
FAVORED BY THE MAYOR
MR. SNOW WAS ONE OF THE
'prime MOVERS.
The Municipal League Platform of
Progress Will Undoubtedly Be
Carried Out by the Incom
ing Government.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March IS.
The result of the municipal election is
taken as an indorsement of the project to
obtain public parks for Oakland. The
platform of the Municipal League and of
the Republican party contains a plank fa
voring parks if the same can be obtained
without drawing the city into some
scheme of real estate men, and the ad
ministration-elect will no doubt proceed
to carry out its platform.
Mayor-elect Snow was one of the orig
inal committee of three to advocate parks,
his confreres being Rev. Dr. J. K. McLean
and John A. Britton. Mr. Snow worked
enthusiastically for many months, and his
large majority can mean nothing but an
indorsement of his plans. After the fail
ure of the measure at the special election
held last summer it was generally be
lieved that a little more campaigning
would have resulted in the passage of the
plan calling for $3*20,000 of a bond issue
to purchase the Adams Point property
and institute marked improvements in
East, West and North Oakland. That
this idea was justified was apparent dur
ing the recent campaign, for all quarters
of town were opposed to introducing op
position to the park project as an issue in
the campaign. â¢
Mr. Snow is an enthusiastic promoter of
this improvement, and he is now in a po
sition where his advocacy of the measure
will of necessity have great weight. Dur
ing the last park agitation he compiled
figures showing how lightly the burden
would fall upon the average taxpayer,
and it is known that he is still of the same
mind.
About three months before the recent
election an effort was made to secure an
other special election on the bond issue,
but the coming of the municipal campaign
caused it to be allowed to lapse. This was
partly because of a desire to test public
feeling on the question by its choice of
city officials. This has been done, and
now nothing remains but to take up the
question and submit it at a special elec
tion, which will doubtless be held this
summer. _____________________
Liked Her Toddy Too Well.
OAKLAND, March IS.â Mrs. Robert J.
Wright's fondness for the flowing bowl
is given in her husband's divorce com
plaint as the cause of the breaking up
of their erstwhile happy home.
According to the deposition of Samuel
Ballentine the couple were married in
Philadelphia eight years ago. After a
few brief months of married bliss Mrs.
Wright developed an appetite for strong
drink. Soon this taste grew into habit,
and finally she became a confirmed slave
to its deceptive influences, and within six
months after the marriage she began
having regular sprees, until It be
came unbearable for plaintiff and hence
the divorce suit.
DINGEE ANSWERS STANLEY.
Denies the Latter's Charges of Ma-
nip .dating Water Stock to His
Disadvantage.
OAKLAND, March IS.â W. J. Dingee
filed an answer this afternoon in the suit
instituted by James Stanley against Mr.
Dingee, Frank Moffitt and the Livermore
Water and Power Company. It is to test
the ownership of 200 shares of capital
stock and bonds in the latter corporation.
Mr. Dingee avers the 200 shares which
plaintiff alleges were deposited with him
were in reality purchased by him for
$90,000 and that Stanley at present has no
interest, right or title in the same. He
asks the court to so decree. The Liver
more "Water and Power Company has
filed a similar answer also, denying Stan
ley's allegations.
Mr. Stanley, in his complaint filed some
weeks ago, claimed he had deposited with
defendants the 200 shares involved in the
suit and that it had been agreed that he
should get 10 per cent of all profits from
the sale of the shares; that Dingee and
Moffitt secured the issue of 200 bonds on
the strength of his shares and from the
sale of 100 of these bonds they received
$50,000, of which amount only $25,000 was
applied to debts of the corporation, the
other $25,000 being divided between Dingee
and Moffitt. He now seeks to recover
$2500, the 10 per cent profit from the sale
of bonds, and also asks that his 200 shares
be reconveyed to him.
DARING BURGLARS CAUGHT.
Vehicle in Which They Were Taking
Their Plunder Away Broke Down.
OAKLAND, March IS.â breaking of
a buggy axle beneath the heavy burden
of their plunder led to the unexpected
capture of two bold thieves to-night.
While the night-watch at the railroad
yards was off guard, shortly after 9
o'clock this evening, William Connelly
and a companion named Halpin, both
aged IS, drove fn a buggy to one of the

of Honor.
sheds and loaded their vehicle with about I
700 pounds of brass bearings and drove '
off again.
When they reached Fifth and Brush
streets the front axle of their buggy [
broke under the strain. Officer Andrews
investigated and identified the brass as â 
belonging to the Southern Pacific Com- I
pany. The patrol wagon was called and
the stolen metal and its possessors were j
taken to the City Prison, where the young
men were registered on the small book.
They will be charged with grand larceny
or burglary. The prisoners had hired I
their buggy at French's stables on Broad- i
way, near Fifth street, and it is presumed
had already bargained with a junk man
for a profitable disposition of their booty. â â 
Will Appeal Her Case.
OAKLAND, March IS.â "Judgment in
favor of plaintiff in the sum of 50 cents,
without costs." So reads an entry made
by ex- Justice of the Peace Clift on Jan
uary 11, 1838. in the suit of Bertha Bos
chau versus Charles Jackson. To-day
the fair plaintiff filed the necessary pa
pers in an appeal from what she consid
ers a very inferior court, forsooth, to the
Superior Court of Alameda County. She
threatens if her hopes of justice are not
realized she will go with her case to the
highest tribunal where justice is doled
out in this State.
Bertha sued Charles Jackson in the Jus
tice's Court two days, after Christmas of
1596 for the recovery of $12 50 for money
borrowed and $12 for board and lodging.
The case hung fire for months and
months, until it was finally tried and de
cided, and then it hung fire some more.
The preponderance of evidence was In
favor of the alleged delinquent boarder.
Still, he offered to allow judgment for $5
to be taken against him. * Plaintiff scorned
the proferred generosity and asked that
judgment be no longer delayed. Judg
ment came in the sum of 50 cents.

CRUEL MURDER
OF A BOY BY
A CONSTABLE
Fred Desirello, at Colma,
Duplicates the Wanton
Crime of Rosser.
fIEPUTY SHERIFF FRED DESIRELLO of Baden deliberately and
*â *â¢"* without the slightest provocation murdered James Johnson, a
17-year-old boy, at Colma last evening about 7:15 o'clock. The
crime was as atrocious as that of Walter Rosser, who shot down
Henry Hildebrand in the Spreckels Market several months ago.
After seeing the result of his wanton act Desirello threatened to
kill two boys who accompanied his victim, and also pointed his pistol
at a bystander who called for a doctor to minister to the dying
boy, and declared he would put a bullet in any one v. ho moved.
The murderer Desirello is In the
Redwood City Jail and the victim of
his lust for slaughter lies blood-stained
and cold in the little parlor of his grlef
atricken sister's home, not far from the
scene of the killing.
No one can Imagine what impelled
the peace officer to deliberately
murder an inoffensive boy who was in
no wise disturbing the peace or who
had not spoken a word to his slayer.
Young Johnson with two other lads,
John Yaccari and Henry Jansen, aged
16 and 14 years respectively, was riding
on a milk wagon when Desirello, with
out warning of any sort, fired three
shots at them. The first bullet struck
a wheel, the second grazed the rim of
young Jansen's hat and the third pen
etrated Johnson's neck, severing the
main artery, causing almost instant
death. The bullet entered the right
side of the neck, passed completely
through and cut the Jugular on both
sides. The boy jumped from the wagon
when he was shot, sank to the earth
and expired at once. A few moments
later the body of the poor youth was
placed in the same wagon and conveyed
to the home of his brother-in-law, J.
Guglimoni, who lives a short distance
from the streetcar line.
Young Johnson has been stopping
with his relative for a few days while
he was out of work. He is an apprentice
molder and his parents live at Eighth
and Folsom streets. His father is the
engineer at the Fairmount Hotel in this
city. A messenger was sent from Colma
to inform the unhappy parents of the
cruel fate which had befallen their only
son, and late last night they reached
the death chamber, where the body of
their boy lies. The poor mother's grief
v. as terrible when she saw the closed
eyes and bloody lips of her son and she
vainly tried to embrace the remains,
but the Coroner had not arrived and
she was forcibly restrained as no one
could be permitted to touch the body
until that official had viewed it.
Disirello committed the murder just
at twilight, in plain view of several
bystanders, and but for his wife it is
more than probable he would have shot
down one or two more people. He was
not drunk, though he had taken a few
drinks, and he appeared to be perfectly
sane. When Johnson sank down, ex
piring, with the blood gushing from
both sides of his neck, saturating his
clothing, the murderer ran over to him
and looked uncompassionately upon
the dying boy. When the body was
carried away he sent his wife to a
nearby saloon for a drink of whisky,
which he gulped down, and then went

over to the home of Constable Dan
Nevills and gave himself up.
He told Nevills he had shot the boy
because he was driving too fast, and
when Nevills attempted to arrest him
he resisted. Thus he added a falsehood
to the capital crime.
Half a dozen persons saw the boys
driving by the White House and they
were not going rapidly. These eyewit
nesses declare that the horses could not
travel a mile in six minutes, even if
they were running away. Desirello
was not the peace officer of the town
and no one expected him to make ar
rests for fast driving, should the occa
sion arise.
The shooting took place in the cen
ter of town, directly in front of Belli
Bros.' store. . The rapid reports of the
three shots startled a number of per
sons in the saloons and stores and they
rushed out to ascertain the cause. They
saw the Deputy Constable, pistol in
hand, rush over to where his victim
had fallen, and heard the murderer
threaten the two frightened boys who
had so narrowly escaped a similar fate.
It was no fault of Desirello's that he
did not kill all three.
John Vaccari, who was driving the
team when Johnson was so wantonly
slain, was sitting beside the dead body
of his companion when he gave the
details of the crime. His face was still
blanched from the fright he received
and the threats of Desirello. The boy
said: .-:â ..â 
"About 7 o'clock I hitched a team
to a milk wagon to go over to Belli's at
Colma and get two bales of hay. As I
was driving up town Jim Johnson
asked me where I was going, and he
jumped in to ride with me. A moment
or two later Henry Jansen also got into
the wagon. We turned the corner in
front of the "White House and crossed
the electric car track to go to Belli's
store. Just then Desirello came out
in the street and began shooting at us.
"He did not shout or say anything
at all. The first bullet struck the wheel
and Jim Johnson said, 'Somebody is
shooting at us.' Then another bullet
whistled by, ticking Henry Jansen's
hat, and the next thing I knew Jim says
'I'm shot.' He never uttered another
word. When the bullet struck him Jim
jumped from the wagon and dropped
down right on Belli's porch. I stopped
the team and Henry and
I also jumped out and ran to Jim. Hen
ry said, 'Some one go for a doctor.' and
Desirello turned furiously" upon him
and threatened to kill him if he moved
a step. Desirello waved his pistol in
the air and shouted that he had 'three
bullets left for any one who made a
move.'
"I asked the Constable why he shot
at us, and he told me to 'shut my
mouth or he would put a bullet in me.'
"By this time a crowd had gathered,
and some one said Jim was dead. A
man started to Baden for a doctor, and
Jim's body was put In the wagon and
taken home. "We were not driving fast
and I do not know why the officer shot
at us. When Jim was lying on the
ground Desirello said we were driving
too fast and might have run over a
child and killed it. I told him I was not
driving fast, and he said I lied."
Henry Jansen, the other boy on the
wagon, corroborated his companion's
statement in every detail.
The Coroner was notified of the mur
der and he sent word to Colma that
a jury would be impaneled to-day.

The Chronicle Bar.
Mr. P. "W. Wobber has opened to the
public under his personal supervision
at 644 Market street (under Chronicle
building) one of the most beautiful bar
rooms of the city. The bar and interior
finish are done entirely in mahogany,
the soft pink tint of which forms a
pleasing contrast to the solid white
of the tile floor and the light, delicate
shades of the walls and ceiling. Two
paintings of unusual merit decorate the
walls. One, "Health to Our Guest," the
other, "A Slave Merchant rat the
Harem,'-' are works of art. The chief
feature of the Chronicle Bar will be the
purity and quality of its wines and
liquors. Mr. Wobber extends a cordial
invitation to the public and connois

FOUNDLING BABES LEFT
BY HEARTLESS MOTHERS
AMONG the manifold blessings that came probably with the rain were
two wee babies found on doorsteps recently after a shower. One, a
chubby girl, blue-eyed, golden-haired, and only a few days old, was
placed at the door of William Wyber*s residence, 2734 Folsom street. Its
only protection against the elements was a heavy black shawl. Upon this
was pinned a note stating the parents were too poor to take care of the
infant. It was so good and so pretty that Mrs. Wyber was almost heart
broken when a lady visitor who had just lost her own baby carried the lit
tle rain waif away to a secure home.
The second castaway was found by Charles Cohn on his doorstep at 208
Polk street late Friday evening. This was also a girl, and was wrapped
in a soldier's cape.* She has a dark complexion and is probably ' Spanish.
In her hands was a bottle of milk, with a long rubber tube and nursing
nipple. From this the motherless youngster was industriously extracting
her supper when Mr. Cohn almost stumbled over her In the dark. If she is a
soldier's baby her gallant father can find her at the St. Joseph Orphan
Asylum when he cornea home from Manilaâ that is, if the Filipinos don't
get him.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, ! MARCH 19, 1899.
IMPLORE THE COURT TO
LICENSE LAWBREAKING
The Scheme of the Promoters of
Racetrack Poolselling Is Finally
Made Plain.
Ask That the Original Restraining Order Against the
Police Be Restoredâ Judge Murasky Refuses,
but Will Hear More Argument.
THERE was no poolselling at Ingle
side yesterday, and a vigilant police
force prevented the hand books from
doing any business. The disgusted
gamblers could only stand around and
curse the authorities who have put a
stop to the blight which has too long
rested upon the city! It was the last day
of the two -weeks' season, and the asso
ciation decided to run off the card
whether or not the daily largess was re
ceived from the gullible public.
Realizing perhaps that the people are
determined to end poolselling at the track
and that the efforts of the police to en
force the law will be indorsed by public
opinion and upheld by the courts, the
gamblers remained downtown. Only a

few spectators watched the horses gal
loping around the track, and their inter
est was halfhearted. Chief of Police
Lees sent a squad of officers to prevent
betting, and his orders were so well exe
cuted that very little money changed
hands on results. .
The gamblers continued their efforts
through Attorney Ach, to secure a li
cense to resume their game, but nothing
to their advantage was. accomplished. In
the morning Judge Murasky denied a
motion to vacate the modified injunction
issued by Judge Daingerfield on Friday

full power to carry on his endeavor to
stamp out a great evil. The cases of all

and that the existence of a law is suffi
cient warrant for a peace officer to make
forcible entry to prevent crime.
District Attorney Murphy. City and
County Attorney Lane and Garret Mc-
Enerney are conducting the fight In court
for law- and order, and Henry Ach is the
champion of the poolsellers.
Judge Murasky held two sessions of De
partment 8 of the Superior Court yester
day to hear arguments on a motion to
vacate the modified injunction issued by
Judge Daingerfield, which permits the
Police Department to perform its duty in
enforcing the anti-pool ordinance. _,
Attorney Aqh, for the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club, sought to have the modified,
injunction vacated and the original order
by Judge Daingerfield, which was ob
tained on an ex parte statement, and re
stricted the police from entering the race
track gates to arrest violators of the or
der passed by the Board of Supervisors,
and subsequently modified on a state
ment of fact by the attorneys for the
Chief of Police restored. He based his
argument on allegations In the complaint
on which Judge Dalngerfleld issued tho
original order restraining the police from
interfering with the poolsellers. The
Jockey Club's attorney contended that the
other "side must move against the original
injunction by answer and affidavit and
that the modified order was in excess of
the authority of the Judge who made it.
He claimed the second order was improvi
dently made, adding: "You cannot cut
me off without an opportunity to be
heard," to which District Attorney.
Murphy replied:
"We have the right to proceed ex parte,
as you did, inasmuch as the injunction
proceedings are palpably an attempt to
tie the hands of the policeâ a most re
markable proceeding to prevent the police
doing their sworn duty." The District
Attorney further argued that the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club .had no right to move
to vacate the modified injunction, stating
that the modification was In fact and ef
fect an absolute abrogation of the orig
inal injunction. All the plaintiff could
now do is to ask for a new injunction,
which, he added, would be promptly and
vigorously, contested.
The application of counsel for the po
lice for time to prepare and file affidavits
and answer in opposition to the motion
to dismiss the modified order was bitterly
objected to by Attorney Ach. He drew a
pitiful picture of a large find vicious body
of. police forcibly entering the private
pleasure ground of a legitimate corpora
tion and devastating the property, fright
ening away the patrons and admirers of
an ennobling sport and otherwise invad
ing the rights of property and liberty
guaranteed to every individual by the
constitution of the United States and the
Declaration of Independence. The acts
of the police, headed by Chief Lees, the
principal defendant in this case, he con
tended, were a violent trespass, without
any warrant in law. At the conclusion of
Lawyer Ach's outburst Attorney McEn
erney had an inning. He said:
"We propose to show by affidavits that
a crime was being committed within the
Ingleside inclosure, and also that, the po
lice were not there to and did not inter
fere with the usual course of the horse
races in progress. The officers of the law
were there for the sole purpose of pre
venting crime. They molested none but
the violators of the law, and only per
formed their sworn duty in taking prop
erty, which was evidence of such infrac
tion of the law as was committed. We have
the right to file such affidavits, and the
court must grant us reasonable time in
which to prepare them.
"The plaintiffs' complaint," continued
Mr. McEnerney, "alleges that the police
were guilty of trespass, that they en
tered .and drove patrons from the race
track, and upon this complaint Judge
Daingerfield issued the original injunction
preventing the police from entering the
Ingleside grounds unless they paid the
regular admission fee, and further for
bade them taking any property from the
place. Upon application made by the de
fendants Judge Daingerfield modified that
order so that it read, 'Unless you, as such
officers, believe a public offense is being
committed, and then you are authorized
to enter.' yâ . â¢-
"In our opinion the original injunction
was void upon its face," argued Mc-
Enerney, '.'and we were prepared to in
struct the Chief of Police to proceed and
defy, it, which we would have done had
not the modification been granted. The
police did not, as alleged in the plain
tiffs' complaint, intend to remove or de
stroy property, but slmpl" to take any
property used in an offense, to be im
pounded as evidence. This privilege was
also granted in the modification of the in
junction.
"To say the police shall not enter a
racetrack without due process of law is
extremely vague and uncertain, it being
in the discretion of any gatekeeper to
interpret what is due process of law.
This injunction was obtained, it is ob
vious, without due . process of law - and
for the reason that with the plaintiff's
connivance, procurement and consent il
legal acts were sought to â ; be * protected.
The plaintiff was intercepted in the com
mission of crime and in defiance of the
law now chooses to come into court with
unclean hands and ask equitable relief
at the hands of the chancellor."
"I may be. dull of comprehension," said
Attorney Ach, in answer, "but I don't un
derstand counsel's argument. Let these
men arrest parties they claim are vio
lating the law and we will meet them on
that issue. If the Chief* believes ' he has
the right to march into *" plaintiff's ' place
of business because he believes a law
is being violated he has a right to march
his men down into the Grand Opera
House if he hears | that some one may
commit battery on a man therein, and in
consequence clean out the house. The
acts Â« of the police are in violation of
every principle of liberty." v-7 ': 1
At this â¢ point the : argument .went over
till 3l p. m. 'When court reconvened the
people s attorneys filed with the clerk an
answer *a -the â¢ Jockey. - Club's y complaint, .
and a joint affidavit sworn to by Chief of
Police Lees, Police Captains Wittman
and Gillen, District Attorney Murphy,
City and County Attorney Lane and At
torney McEnerney. The answer contains
general and specific contradictions of the
allegation of the complaint, and the affi
davit recites the facts of the arrests at
Ingleside, and, further, that the modifica
tion of the injunction was not improvi
dently or erroneously made, but the re
sult of a full, fair statement of facts to
his Honor, Judge Dalngerfleld.
District Attorney Murphy asked that the
proceedings, which are of grave public
importance, be taken by the shorthand re
porter, and Mr. Ach resumed his argu
ment. He asked that his motion to va
cate the modified injunction be granted,
and disputed the argument of the other
side that the only remedy to prevent a
police invasion of Ingleside was to secure
a new order. It was conceded by both
sides that the court has the power to re
instate the original injunction, but Mc-
Enerney reiterated his contention that the
flrst order was void and that the second
necessarily fell with it, thus leaving the
police free to discharge their duty. Judge
Murasky interrupted the argument at this
point, saying:
"I have looked up the law during the
recess and failed to find any statute per
mitting the police to enter private prop
erty unless a felony is being committed."
"That makes no difference in this case."
interrupted Mr. McEnerney. "If the po
lice exceeded their authority and commit
ted trespass the complainant has redress
in a common law action, and not other
wise. The Jockey Club should have
brought a civil action and not asked for
an injunction, which will not lie."
Mr. Ach renewed his argument of the
earlier session and drew a simile of homes
and theaters being forcibly invaded by
overzealous policemen without warrant of
law. He conceded that a Board of Super
visors could not be restrained from pass
ing ordinances, nor could the police be
restrained by order of the court from en
forcing them. ' ,
"The question of selling or buying pools
on races," said Mr. Ach, "does not enter
here. The police had no right to force
their way through the gates of the Ingle
side track, even if they did believe an
ordinance was being violated. Suppose,
for the sake of argument, that Mr. F. H.
Green, the secretary of the Jockey Club,
should announce in public that he would
commit battery at the track some day
next week. The police could not arrest
him for that, nor have they the right to
march out there and force' an entry into
the track to prevent him from assaulting
any one. They could bind him over to
keep the peace and that's all they could
do. Admitting, even, that the order of
the Board of Supervisors is legal, still the
police have no right to enter the gate
without paying the usual admission fee.
"The very Idea is abhorrent," declared
Mr. Ach. "The Chief of Police has no
authority to arrest any person in advance
of the commission of an offense, and they
have no right to forcibly enter a private
house, a church or a place of amuse
ment." vy.yy
"There Is no contention on that, is
there?" inquired the Judge.
"Yes, there is," replied McEnerney.
"While we admit the rule we take ex
ception to it." yyy y
About this time the courtroom became
insufferably hot, the result of a cold
blooded bailiff's ability to build a hot fire,
and Attorney Ach proposed an adjourn
ment. He said his argument would take
up a couple of hours and in addition he

He suggested that the affidavit and .an
swer by the defense be admitted to file
and the question at issue be submitted on
briefs Messrs. Murphy and McEnerney
demurred. They preferred to argue the
case, and it was finally agreed that argu
ments would begin next Friday at 11
o'clock. Judge Murasky will devote that
day to the case, the time to be equally
divided between both sides.
Before ordering an adjournment Judge
Murasky announced that in his opinion
the modified injunction was in excess of
the power of the court and that there
fore the original might be in force. That
point, however, he will decide after argu
ments are made and precedents cited.
Replying to this point the defense claimed
that the court had no authority to issue
the original.
Mr. Ach then concluded his talk for the
day. He referred to the remarks of the
opposing counsel at the morning session
where he was accused of coming into
court with "unclean hands." "That cuts
no 'figure," he acrimoniously declared.
"The directors of the Jockey Club sought
to protect the association's property."
"You came into a court of equity,"
burst in District Attorney Murphy, "and
ask the court to license a violation of the
law."
"We are not asking for a license," rÂ«
torted Ach.
"Yes you are," the District Attorney re
plied, "and you won't get it."
The hearing was then postponed until
next Friday. ***&*-__*
CLERK RICE OPENLY
VIOLATED THE LAW
An Ordinance Forbids Acceptance of
Bail Bonds â¢ Outside Police
Court Chambers.
The action of Clerk Rice of Judge Con
lan's court in accepting bonds at the race
track last Tuesday for the men arrested
was severely, criticized by the police, but
Rice claimed that he had a perfect right
to accept bonds anywhere so long as the
sureties were responsible people.
Captain Seymour discovered yesterday
that Rice was guilty of a gross violation
of an ordinance passed by the Board of
Supervisors April 28, 1593, owing to the
practice of clerks of. Police Courts accept
ing bonds in saloons and other places at
all hours of the night. Section 1 of the
ordinance reads as follows:
The clerks of the Police Courts
shall be in attendance in their re
spective court rooms or offices at
tached thereto from 9 o'clock a. m.
until 4 o'clock p. m. every day in the
week, Sundays and holidays except
ed, to perform the duties imposed and
as required by law. The clerks of
the Police Courts shall also alternate
so that one clerk in turn shall be in
attendance at the court room or office
attached thereto every evening in the
week from 7:30 to 10 o'clock and on
Sundays and holidays from 10 a. m.
to 2 p. m. for the purpose of taking
bail bonds when a sufficiency and
qualification of securities are exam
ined into and approved.
The clerks of the Police Courts
shall not accept securities on bail
bonds except within the places and
within the time prescribed in this
section.
The. attention of the Police Judges will
be drawn to this section of the ordinance,
and they will be asked to see that it is
enforced.

A "WHITE MAN has at last wit
nessed the secret rites of the fire
worshipers of America. He ac
complished this after . years of
unremitting effort to convince
these people of his friendliness.
It was not, however, until he entered the
Mogul priesthood that he was successful.
The fortunate man is J. Walter Fewkes,
who has done more toward supplying the
connecting links between ancient and
modern Indians than any other man. His
work along these lines has made him
famous the world over.
The Moqui Indians are the sole repre
sentatives of what their sort of Indian
was In past centuries. They are almost
the same to-day as when Coronado's men
found them early ln the sixteenth cen
tury. In the village where Mr. Fewkes
lived, Walpi, the houses are centuries old,
located on the brow of a cliff hundreds
of feet above a great plain, and are not
one jot different from the dwellings that
have occupied that site for perhaps a
thousand years. The scientist lived
among the Indians as one of them, and
In this isolation from the white folks has
been alone, except during the latter years
of his investigation when Mrs. Fewkes
accompanied him, the first white woman
ever looked on with favor by the Moqui
race.
The customs of their neighbors, the
Apaches, as well as : those of the other
Indian tribes with whom people are fa
miliar, are utterly unlike the ways and
habits of the Moquis. In the '80*8, when
the white men of science flrst visited
them, they were still using stone imple-
m ents, and. in fact, living -in just the
' way that we are taught the Indians lived
when Columbus made his entrance on the
scene.
.While history is unable to give any in
formation of the Moquis before the ad
vent of Coronado's men, investigation of
the graves made by Mr. : , Fewkes furnishes
conclusive proof that the symbols of the
tribe were as ancient in the sixteenth
century as they are regarded by the Mo
quis of to-day. .\'"._ _â¢â ;".
' While Mr. Fewkes had no difficulty In,
witnessing a number of the Moqui cere
monies, he was well aware that there
were very Interesting secrets in-connec
tion with the religious rites of the In
dians of which he was entirely ignorant.
Every effort he made to learn was check
mated, and he found that as an outsider
he was at the end of his investigation.
"I saw," he said, when telling me the
result of his investigations, "that it was
through the priesthood I must get at the
facts. The Moquis were distinctly fire
worshipers, though unlike any other of
the â¢ re worshiping sect of which I ever
beard. -They created their sacred fireâ
this I knewâ but how it was all done was
beyond me. It took a very long time, and
the utmost care, to convince the Indians
that I meant only good and that I did not
want to use the Information I gained to
their disadvantage. At last I brought
them to a frame of mind where they
agreed that I should enter their priest
hood and be Initiated into the secrets of
their underground temples, for the more
* important features of the Moqui ritual
are performed in these caves.. :"'-._
.. "It was in one of these temples that I
â¢witnessed what to me was as interesting
a thing as could be seen,* of all the more
interest because I knew that I was the
first white man whom the Moquis had
ever permitted to be present on such an
'occasion. To the Moqui fire is a living,
* breathing thing. Its creation Is to him
exactly the same as the birth of a child.
â¢It iÂ« a sacred creation, however, and the
Indian pays to the flame as great a trib
ute -as he can conceive of-no one is per
mitted to light either a pipe or cigarette
from it. And when you stop to think that
' with the Indian all things begin and end
with a smoke you see the significance of
his action.ifl_|SfiS , â _, â  â¢â¢_",'
"The ritual observed in the creation or
. the fire is so simple that it Is impressive.
The members of the priesthood present
gather in a semicircle in front of the al
tar. and the priest upon whom falls the
duty of bringing the fire into being takes
a notched piece of wood and in that notch
places a stick which nearly fills it. This
' stick he rapidly rotate*!. Directly be
neath the earth has been covered with
Bltredded cedar. A hush that .is Impres
sive follows, nothing being heard except
the grinding noise made by the two pieces
of wood. The friction of the wood is con
tinued for not more than 'a minute when
a spark falls upon the cedar, and . then
_ another. The blaze is Instantly nursed
- .and presently is of sufficient size to per
mit a torch to be lighted from it. The
sacred fire has come into being.
"Then one of the priests is selected to
carry the fire and the news from house
to house. In every dwelling the squaws
are waiting for him, the pile of fuel is
ready and he. lights it with his torch. The
proceeding is the same in every dwelling
and after a while every house in the vil
lage has its, flame, which will not be al
lowed =to die out -until, summer comes.
That is all that happens the day of the
fire's creation, but the day following is
celebrated by-- processions and Incanta
tions of various sorts, of a nature which
does not permit of description. It is all
along the line of the Indians' idea of the
resemblance of the birth of fire to that of
a human being.
"The ceremonies do not, I think, have
the same weight with the younger genera
tion of Indians that they, do With the
elders. In fact. I am inclined to believe
that the younger element would willing
ly break away from this sort of thing if
It could. This ceremony of the flre crea
tion seemed all j the more interesting to
me -because it Is an- undeniable fact that
the -rites I saw in the caves had never
before been witnessed by a white man.
"The Moqui priesthood is made up of a

number of different degrees and I suc
ceeded in being admitted to four. of the
priesthoods. Further progress was re
fused me by the older priests on the
ground that they did not think I could
stand the ordeal. I rather doubt the
truth of that statement, because I do not
think the ordeal was very severe, judg
ing from what I had already endured.
As it is, however, I was enabled through
my membership of the priesthood to gain
a knowledge of the aboriginal rites that
has hitherto been unknown to history.
I know of none more interesting than
that of the creation of fire.
"There is a great deal more to learn
with the Moquis, but every year robs
them of more and more of their aborigi
nal traits. In ten years' time I believe
their racial distinction will have entirely
disappeared. In the absence of an epi
demic, a census which I took several
years ago shows the tribe can about hold
Its own in point of numbers. The out
break of smallpox which forced me to re
turn East is likely to carry off a great
many of the Moquis, and a loss of this
sort can never be made up. ,v, -;

within the last year white people have
taken to going to the village in numbers.
The, village is located about eighty miles
west of the Grand Canyon and thirty
miles from the Santa Fe Railroad. The
railroad people have been running excur
sions from the road to the village at the
time the snake dance, the flute dance and
the basket dance have taken place. The
excursionists have been loaded into four
mule wagons, driven to the village, where
they camped that night; witnessed the
dance and returned to the railroad the
following day. This has caused the In
dians to learn the ways of the white man
ip one respectâ they ask every visitor to
contribute some money in return for the
privilege of seeing the dance, and in this
way quite a deal of money is put into
circulation among them. When I- first
knew them they did not know what it
was to have money.
"By nature the Moquis are a peaceful
people. They are short of stature and
slight. At first they clung very closely
to the customs of their ancestors a.nd
resented the first attempt made to intro
duce the white man's education among
them. I remember when I first visited
them years ago, Just after it had been
decided to try to educate them, a young
lieutenant of cavalry with six men rode
over to my camp from the railroad to get
some information about the Moquis. He
was on his way to another village, a
larger one, where he proposed to enforce
the Government order that some of the
Indian children be sent to an Indian
school, a building . for which had been
- erected fifteen miles distant. The lieu
-1 tenant wanted me to go with f him. but I
refused, because it would have been fatal
to my plan to learn the Indian rites. .
"The* cavalrymen camped with me that
night, and the next morning rode over to
the other village. That afternoon they
returned, but without any children. The
lieutenant said that when he reached the
village he ' found every Inhabitant armed ,
and saw that if .he attempted any force
he and his soldiers would be wiped out.
He said he was going back to the rail
road and* telegraph' for four. companies of 'â¢
cavalry "to .come from the nearest fort to
his assistance. The Indians., he said, '
would be made to. give up", their children.
"The day's went- by and- all sorts of ;
rumors began to circulate as to what was I
going to happen. I had learned the In
dian language fairly well, and the old
chiefs told me that over at the other vil
lage they believed the whole United
States army, whatever that was, was
coming. A few days later I noticed a
commotion among the Indians, and saw
away out on the prairie a long line of
blue marching in our direction. It proved
to be the four companies of regulars,
headed by Major, now Adjutant-General,
Corbin." The troops went into camp on
the mesa below the cliff where the ob
stinate villagers lived. I camped with
them, and the next morning Major Cor
bin sent a message up to the Indians to
send down six of their chiefs for a par
ley.
"After a while the chiefs came down
and were very meek indeed. After a bit
the colonel ordered an advance, and we
marched up to the village. , What was
our amazement to find the place deserted.
There was not an Indian in sight. But
at last one of our prisoners told me that
they were out on the pointâ that is, a
point of land stretching out north away
from the village and out of sight of the
dwellings. We followed this up and found
it to be true. There they were, huddled
together, SOO men, women and children,
expecting to. be killed. I suppose.' They
had no Idea there were so many white
men in the world, and were, simply terri
fied at the thought that Washingtonâ for
to the Indian every Government official
and the Government is Washingtonâ had
come out in such array against them.
"Major Corbin talked to them and ex
plained how impossible it was for them
to resist Washington and how their chil
dren were going to be educated whether
they wanted them to be or not. Just to
emphasize his words about the power of
the soldiers, the Major ordered one of the
two mountain howitzers discharged. Now
those howitzers carried a very ugly little
shell which would make a decided com
motion. The gun was. discharged and
threw the shell about a mile out on the
mesa, where It tore the sand up and dug
a big hole. The Indians were almost par
alyzed with fright, except' one of the
chiefs whom the troops were holding as
hostages. .â At the report of the gun, he
went over the side of the . cliff, which
must have been. at least twenty feet high,
as* if he had been shot, and though the
troops fired in the direction he had gone
and hunted for him, we never saw him
again. ."â .?;'.'â ;
"After parleying a while longer. Major
Corbin Induced the chiefs to select a"
number of. children to be sent to the
school." smoked the' pipe, of peace with the
head men and led his troops back to the
railroad, taking the young Indians with
him. That was the end of the Moqui at
tempt *to resist ' Washington's' Ideas of
education."
It may surprise some readers to have It
recalled that even Burns, who has been
designated, par excellence, the "Bard of
Nature," neither in his poetry nor his
. letters shows any appreciation of the
picturesque in nature. From his farm at
Mossgiel he commanded one of the finest
views ln Scotland, embracing Ben-Lo
mond, Ben-Venue and the other moun
tains keeping watch around Loch Lomond
and Loch Katrine, and the exquisite
Firth of Clyde with its numerous lochs
winding away northward among tne
lonely pastoral' hills of Argyleshlre.
Above all, Arran. with its grandly ro
mantic mountain farms, was daily before
his eyes, as wen as the giant mass of
Allsa, rising sentinel-like, sheer and soli
tary, out of the water where the firth
merges into the Irish Sea. Yet not once
will you find him making mention of this
noble land and sea scape so constantly
in his view. In his northern tour he trav

Alger: Most Talked of Man of the Hour: Algerism.
How He Climbed
From the Plow
to a Position
in the Cabinet.
WHEREVER a number of
Americans get together fhe dis
cussion sooner or laterâ usually
much soonerâ sure to turn
upon the great happenings at
home and abroad in which our
army and navy have been en
gaged I have participated in hundreds
Of such talks, and I have been most forci
bly struck with the turn the discussion al
ways takes. Dewey's deeds 4 are always
spoken of with unstinted praise; all men
seem to agree that no matter what the
emergency Dewey will not fail to do ex
actly the right thing. Then the whole
navy is praised and sincere regret ex
pressed that unwisdom and too great per
sonal friendliness should have provoked
any discussion as to the merits of the sea
services of those who destroyed Cervera's
ships and so enabled Shafter to win his
hazardous campaign.
Shafter is talked of, too, but not as he
was months ago. Now he appears to be
regarded as an Incident, almost an acci
dental incident, of occurrences too big for
him to control, though he was nominally
In control. Of the real fighting men of
the army the praise is in superlatives, and
officers and men are held In the highest
esteem conceivable as types of American
manhood of which we have every right
to be proud. * . .
, The President is always spoken of
.throughout all these discussions, and
there is no denying that both Democrats
and Republicans feel kindly disposed to
him. They think he has made grave mis
takes, but the general verdict is that he
is a well meaning and patriotic man,
whose mistakes have been those of a
weak reliance on some weak men to whom
he has unwisely given his confidence.
At the Other End.
But there Is one man who stands some
what as Dewey stands, except that it is
at the opposite end of popular favor. This
man Is Russell A. Alger, the Secretary of
War In McKinley's Cabinet. This man is
to-day perhaps the most unpopular man
in the United States, and in the discus
sions just alluded to men not given to
profanity or to forcefulness of expression
swear like pirates and say that they be
lieve him capable of every great crime
and every little meanness that could be
mentioned.
Alger is the man of the hour, and
Democrats and | Republicans alike
agree that the McKinley administra
tion will be judged at the polls,- not
by the victories of the army and
navy, not by the revival of trade and
a renewal of business prosperity, but
by what has come to be known as
Algerism. .
Alger's Early Life.
General Alger, like so many Americans
who have achieved prominence in the
last forty years, is a native of Ohio. He
was born in Lafayette Township, Medi
na County, February 27, _**_6, so that we
see he is now just 63 years old. His pa
rents were poor, farmers or country
storekeeper? or something of that sort'
When his father died the present Secre;
tary of War was 12 years old. It was ne
cessary for him to go to work at once.
And so from 12 to 19 he worked on farms
ln Richfield, Ohio. At the beginning of
this apprenticeship he went with some
regularity to a country school during the
short terms which then prevailed. Wtiat
he did between 1855 and 1857 I have not
heard, but presumably he followed the
plow and worked ln the harvest field
much as he had done in the years before.
He went to Akron ln I**s7 to study law.
While Alger was studying law ln Akron
McKinley was at school only a few miles
away. Little did the people of that prim
itive neighborhood dream that two youth

learned enough to hurt. At any rate, his

Alger's War Record.
Now let us look at the Alger war rec
ord, a war record the greater part of
which was as fine as he could have
wished.
He enlisted In the army August 19, 1861,
and was made f captain In the Second
Michigan Cavalry on September 2 of the
same year. He was thrown from his
horse the next July and -hit in the stom
ach, so he went. on leave of absence. He
Stayed away some-two months and re
turned to service ln September. During
his absence he had been promoted to be
major, and in October, he was again pro
moted, so that he was now. a lieutenant
colonel and transferred" to the Sixth Michi
gan Cavalry- On June 30, 1863. he was
made colonel of the Fifth Michigan Cav
alry. As such he remained for some fif
teen months, when his service ended as
will presently be shown. â â¢.-._. ,

As a fighting man -Alger had won very
generous recognition from those Imme
diately over him in rank, and Generals
Custer, Merritt, Pleasanton, Kllpatrick,
Torbert and Sheridan united in recom
mending - him for a brigadier general's
commission as early as 1863. â  Here is Gen
eral Custer's letter of October 19, 1863,
with the indorsement of Kllpatrick,
Pleasanton and Meade:

ONE OF THESE CARDINALS MAY BE THE "POPE OF FIRE"
Singular Prophecy Made by the Irish Saint Regarding t&e Succession of Popes.
ONE of the most active factors in
the prevailing gossip In Rome
about a successor to Pope Leo Is
a series of prophecies concerning
occupants of the chair of St. Peter
, made by an Irish monk, St. Ma
lachy, more than seven hundred years
ago.: St.Malachy's remarkable success in
predicting 'the line of papal succession In
the past leads many people to think his
predictions will be again fulfilled on the
death of the present Pope. According to
the Irish saint . the next wearer of the
tiara will be a "man of fire." '
There are several canonical decrees pro

ancient customs of Denmark, they are

certainty of the date of official summons
to the conclave the speculation as to its
possible choice goes on. A few weeks ago
Pope Leo, speaking to a foreign bishop
who was visiting him, said:

And here is General Judson Kilpatrick's
Indorsement: "I have witnessed the gal
lantry and skill of Colonel Alger, - "com
manding Fifth Michigan Cavalry, on
many occasions. His prompt and ener
getic action yesterday saved a large por
tion of my command from being captured,
Ed me."
Four years ago, in September of- 1894,
there was also much talk about the Papal
succession. A statement made, by Cardi
nal Parocchl started it. Pope' Leo, re
ferring to . this gossip in a conversation
he had with the Duke of Montalto; said
that perhaps the conclave was yet. far
off, as .he' came of a long-lived family.,
most of the Peccis having been over 90
when they died; and then he added:
"So it seems to me that certain Cardi

. Leo XIII Ib now in the twenty-second
year of his pontificate. Only seven of
the 262 Popes preceding him reigned twen
ty-one years. The average length of the
papal reign Is a little more than seven
years. Ten Popes died within a month
after their election. The shortest reign
was that of Stephen llâ three days. The
choice- of the Pope is usually made from
the Cardinals, but it is not generally
known that a layman might legally be
chosen, provided he shall take holy or
ders before his coronation.
General Meade, however, made this re
mark: "Respectfully forwarded, with the
remark that this recommendation has
been sent in without any call for me for '
recommendation for the appointment of
brigadier general." *- â¢
This effort, it will be seen, was squelched
by General Meade, without any reflec
tions, however, on the merits of Alger ;
himself. So General Custer bided his
time, and then renewed his recommenda
tion, as follows: .......---.
Custer's Recommendation.
"June 26, 1864.
"I have the honor to recommend that
Colonel R. A. Alger, Fifth Michigan Cav
alry, be promoted to the- rank of briga
dier general United States volunteers.
"This recommendation is based upon the
valuable service of -this officer, in the field..
He has been in the service since the com
mencement of the war. During this pe
riod He has served with distinction lln
every grade from that of captain up to
colonel. He has distinguished himself on
almost every occasion in which our cav
alry has been engaged. His gallantry at
Gettysburg rendered him conspicuous:
also at Boonsboro, where he received a*
severe wound while leading his regiment
In- a charge upon the enemy.
"In the engagements of more recent
date Colonel Alger has borne an Impor
tant part in the battle of Yellow Tavern,
which resulted In the death of the rebel
General Stuart and the capture of two
pieces of artillery. Too much praise can
not be given Colonel Alger for the gal
lantry he displayed. He is particularly
â  â¢ .. .
well qualified for the command of cav
alry; Therefore I respectfully but earn
estly recommend him for promotion."
'This was approved by General Torbert,;
and General Sheridan wrote as follows:
'"I respectfully recommend the appoint
ment of Colonel Alger. Fifth Michigan
Cavalry, to rank of brigadier general of
volunteers. Colonel Alger has distin
guished himself in the engagements at
Todd's Tavern, Meadow Bridge, in front
'of Richmond and at Han's Shop and Tre
villlan Station, in the present campaign,
and has heretofore by his ability and gal
lant conduct rendered important services
to the Government."
' Sheridan to the Rescue.
Meade made the same remark as be
fore, and General Sheridan, fearing that
nothing would be done for Alger, wrote
another letter ten days or so -after his
letter just quoted. It Is as follows, and.
as will be seen, this time It was approved
by Meade: . , : .

It is known, though, that international
as weir as ecclesiastical politics plays a
considerable part in the election. There
are two parties now in formal active In
fluence among the Cardinalsâ intran
sigents, or supporters, of the rights of
temporal sovereignty, and the concilia
tlonlsts, who advocate a certain 'measure
of compromise with the Italian Govern
ment. Of the first Cardinal Parocchl, the
present vicar of the Pope. Is the candi
date; of the second Cardinal Vincenzo
Vannutelli Is the leader. Cardinal Ram-
Tolla, the Secretary of State, is believed
to be the ablest man in, the Sacred Col
lege, but, like many another statesman,
this strength Is his greatest weakness as
a candidate. Cardinals Oreglia, Jacoblni
and Satolli are also regarded as avail
able In the clash of the two groups.
There are. of course, outsiders, and it
is in the consideration of these that the
forecasts of St. Malachy's prophecies
come into immediate view In their appli
cation to the personality of the next
Pope. ' - ;'" :-
The Prophet and His Signs.
St. Malachy was an Irish saint, born in
Armagh In the year 1094. He became in
time Archbishop of that see. He was an
Intimate friend of St. Bernard. Abbot of
Clalrvaux. France, and vied in the lat
ter's arms *on November 2. 1148, in his
fifty-fourth year.
His series of prophecies concerning the
succession of Popes has for several hun
dred years been a marvel to succeeding
generations. They are mentioned first In
print by Arnold Wion. a monk of Monte
Casino, in 1595, in his book, "Lignum
Vltae." Another work, written In 1670 by
John Germano and published in Naples,
Is called "The Life, Works and Prophe
cies of Holy St. Malachy." The prophe
cies are also to be found in a "History of
the Popes." dated Lyons, 1688; in the Abbe
de Vallemonfs "Elements de l'Histoire,"
1702, -.nd other volumes of more recent
date. â¢â¢-""â¢"-â¢ .* .''-â â - â-_. _
These predictions are short forecasts,
giving some noticeable trait of all the
future Popes, from Celestlne 11, who was
elected in the year 1130, until the end of
time, which. In accordance with this
scheme, will come with the tenth Pontiff
after the incumbent's reign is over.
As the good saint has.' however, not in
dicated the duration of each reign, the
average mortal of. to-day need have no
immediate terror of the general judg
ment. The coincidences of the predictions
have In many instances been most re
markable. It would take up too much
space to go over the whole list. Those
for the Pontiffs of the present century
will serve 'to show the scefpe of the proph
ecies and their seeming accuracy.

Pope Pius VI was elected February 15.

"Peregrlnus Apostollcus"â the Apostolic

journeying in France. The titles predict
ed for his 'successors were as follows:

General Meade approved this, but Gen
eral Grant sent lt to the War Department
with this letter:
"Respectfully forwarded with the re
mark that the officers herein recommend
ed are worthy, meritorious and worthy of
promotion to till any vacancies that may
exist, but I would respectfully suggest
that if any promotions are to be made or
vacancies filled justice to the entire army
would demand that they be not made un
til recommendations for promotion, etc.,
for meritorious services can also be (> ob
tained from the Southwestern army.
So here it will be seen that It was Gen-
eral Grant "who stood In the way of Al
ger's immediate promotion. We find him,
therefore, much discouraged and most
anxious to get away -so as -to ..look.- after
things In Washington or to go to Michi
gan and attend to his plunging business.
Promotion in the army had come to him
rapidly, and it was galling to him to re
main in one grade for more than a year.
We have seen what his commanders
thought of himâ they approved of him
most highly, they wanted him to be ad
vanced. But his zeal was gone; he had
tired of being a mere colonel.
Then again his pine lands needed at
tentionâsomething might happen to
them. And so the gallant Colonel, as we
will see by a further glimpse at his rec
ord, deliberately threw his career away.
His applications for leave when he was
needed with his command and his ab
sences without leave wore out the pati
ence of Custer, who had him reported to
Sheridan's headquarters. Custer was
asked for a further report, and sent In

St. Bridget of Sweden Is also credited
with . a prophecy that the world would
end In 1999.
Who Is the Man?
Such being the forecast, whenever a
Pope's reign ended there has been much
speculation as to the Cardinal whose per
sonality would fit the prediction for the
next one. A Cardinal who Is a likely can
didate is called "papabile," and his ad
herents "papegglantl." At present two
names are suggested from the roll of the
Sacred College as those for whom the
Malachlan prophecy was intended. One
is that of the former general of the bare
footed Carmelites, Cardinal Glrolamo
Gottl. The other ls that of Cardinal
Dominico Svampa, Archbishop .of Bo
logna. â¢ *
The title given by St. Malachy for the
next Pope, it will be remembered, Is
"Ignis Ardens"â ardent or blazing fire.
Admirers of Cardinal Gottl say his piety,
zeal and fervor for the Papacy and the
church fUi.y carry out this allegorical
designation. He is the son of a dock la
borer, and was born at Genoa March 29,
1834. It Is a notable fact about the pres
ent College of Cardinals that a majority
of them, and with only two or three ex
ceptions, the leading members are all
men of the most democratic and humble
origin, who have risen to their present
rank by sheer force of their intellectual
ability.Special to Th* Sunday Call. Copyright-: IS-3,

in the eastern sky. two of the mulattos,
Blanco and Duranno. crept silently up
behind the seaman and struck him
down with handspikes.
Early, the English lad. who knew
nothing of the plot, was looking out
on the forecastle head at the time.
Above the humming of the foresail
above him and the lapping of the water,
he heard a sudden crash and the voice
of the mate calling murder. He ran
aft and found Duranno. with horrible
persistence, still beating the mate about
the head. When he attempted to Inter
fere the fellow ordered him sternly into
the deckhouse and he obeyed. . In the
deckhouse the Norwegian carpenter
and Candereau, the French seaman,
were sleeping, both of whom were
among the honest men. The boy Early
told them what had occurred, his story
belng corroborated by the screeches
of the mate from outside. The car
penter ran out and found the unfortu
nate fellow with his arm broken and
his face horribly muitllated.
"Who's that.'" he cried, as he heard
steps approaching.
"It's me the carpenter."
"For God's sak : get me into the
cabin!" " 7... -
The carpenter had stooped with the
intention of doing so, but Marsollno,
one of the conspirators, hit him on the
back of the neck and knocked him
down. The blow was not a dangerous
one, rut the carpenter took it as a
sign that he should mind his own
business, for he went back with impo
tent tears to his deckhouse. In the
meanwhile Blanco, who was the giant
of the party, with the help of another
mutineer, had raised Karswell, and
hurled htm. still yelling for help, over
the bulwarks into the sea. He had been
the first attacked, but he was not the
first to die.
The first of those below to hear the
dreadful summons from the deck was
the captain's brother, George Smith â
the one who had come for a pleasure
trip. He ran up the companion and
had his head beaten to pieces with
handspikes as he emerged. Of the per
sonal characteristics of this pleasure
tripper the only item which has been
handed down is the grim fact that he
was so slight that one man was able
to throw his dead body overboard. The
captain had been aroused at the same
time and had rushed from his room
into the cabin. Thither he was fol
lowed by Leon, "Watto and Lopez, who
stabbed him to death with their knives.
There only, remained Taffir. the second
mate, and his adventures may be treat
ed with less reticence since they were
happier in their outcome.
He was awakened In the first gray
of dawn by the sounds of smashing
and hammering upon the companion.
To so experienced a seaman those
sounds at such an hour could have
carried but one meaning, and that the
most terrible which an officer at sea
can ever learn. With a sinking heart
he sprang from his - bunk and rushed
to the companion. It was choked by
the sprawling figure of the captain's
brother, upon whose head a rain of
blows was still descending. In trying
to push his way up Taffir received a
crack which knocked him backward.
Half distracted he rushed back Into
the cabin and turned down the lamp.
which was smoking badly â a graphic
little touch which helps us to realize
the agitation of the last hand which
lit it. He then caught sight of the
body of the captain pierced with many
stabs and lying in his blood-mottled
nightgown upon the carpet. Horrified
at the sight he ran back into his berth
and locked the door, waiting in a help
less quiver of apprehension for the
next move of the mutineers. He may
not have been of a very virile char
acter, but the circumstances were
enough to shake the most stout-heart
ed. It is not an hour at which a man
Is at his best, that chill hour of the
opening dawn, and to have seen the

the night before, lying in their blood.
seems to have completely unnerved
him. Shivering and weeping he lis
tened with straining ears for the foot
steps which would be the forerunners
of death.
At last they came, and of a half
dozen men at least, clumping heavily
down the brass-clamped steps of the
companion. A hand beat roughly upon
his door and ordered him out. He
knew that his frail lock was no protec
tion, so he turned the key and stepped
forth. It might well have frightened a
stouter man, for the murderers were
all â Leon. Carlos. Santos, Blanco,
Duranno. Watto dreadful looking folk
most of them at the best of times, but
now. armed with their dripping knives
and crimson cudgels, and seen in that
dim morning light, as terrible a group
as ever a writer of romance hos con
jured up in his imagination. The Manila
men stood in a silent semicircle round
the door, with their savage Mongolian
faces turned upon him.
"What are you going to do with me?"
he cried. "Are you going to kill me?"
He tried to cling to Leon as he spoke,
for as the only one who could speak
English he had become the leader. : .. -
"No," said Leon; "we are not going
to kill you. But we have killed the
captain and the mate. Nobody on
board knows anything of navigation.
You must navigate us to where we can
land."
The trembling mate, hardly believing
th" comforting assurance of safety,
eagerly accepted the commission.
"Where shall I navigate you to?" he
asked. .v.y^y.i
There, was a whispering in Spanish
among the dark-faced men. and it was
Carlos who answered in broken Eng
lish. 7--:*--7 v '-*
Take up River Platte," said he.
"Good country' Plenty Spanish!" And
so it was agreed.
And now a cold fit of disgust seems
to have passed through those callous
ruffians, for they brought down mops
and cleaned out the cabin. A rope was
slung round the captain and he was
hauled on deck. Taffir, to his credit be
It told. Interfering to impart some de
cency to the ceremony of his burial.
"There goes the captain," cried Watto,
the handsome Levantine lad, as he
heard the splash of the body. "He'll
never call us names any more." Then
all hands were called into the saloon
with the exception of Candereau, the
Frenchman, who. remained at the
wheel. Those who were Innocent hac
to pretend approval of the crime to save
their own lives.
The captain's effects were laid ouv

teen shares. Watto insisted that it
should only be eight shares, as only
eight were concerned In the mutiny,. but
Leon with greater sagacity argued that
every one should be equally involved in
the crime by taking their share of the
booty. There were money and clothes
to divide, and a big box of boots which
represented some little commercial ven
ture of the captain's. Every one was
stamping about in a new pair. The ac
tual money came to about Â£10 each,
and the watch was set aside to be sold
and divided later. Then the mutineers
took permanent possession of the cabin,
the course of the ship was altered for
South America and the 111-fated bark
began the second chapter of her in
famous voyage.
The cargo had been broached and
the decks were littered with open cases
of champagne from which every one
helped himself as he passed. -There
was a fusillade of popping corks all
day, and the air was full of the faint,
sickly sweet smell of the wine. The
second mate was nominally command
er, but he was a commander without
the power to command. From- morn
ing to night' he was. threatened and in
sulted, and it was only Leon's inter
ference and the well-grounded convic
tion that they could never make the
land without him, which saved him
from their daily menaces. They gave
a zest to their champagne carousals by
brandishing their knives - In -his face.
All the honest men were subjected to
the same treatment. 'â¢ â :-_;.-'â 
Santos and Watto came to the Nor
wegian carpenter's whetstone to shar
pen their knives, explaining to him as
they did so that they would soon use
them on his throat. Watto, the hand
some lad, declared that he had already
killed sixteen men. He ' wantonly
stabbed the Inoffensive Chinese stew
ard through the fleshy part of the arm.
Santos said to Candereau, the French
man, "In two or three days I shall kill
you!"
"Kill me then!" cried Candereau with
spirit. " :.â
"This knife." said the bully, "will
serve you the same that it has the
captain."
There seems to have been no attempt
upon the part of the nine honest men
to combine against the eight rogues.
As they were all of different races and
spoke different languages it is not sur
prising that they were unable to make
head against the armed and unanimous
mutineers.
And then there befell one of those
Incidents which breaks the monotony of
long sea voyages. The topsails of a
ship showed above the horizon and
soon there rose her hull. Her course
would take her across their bows, and
the mate asked leave to hall her, as he
was doubtful as to his latitude.
* "You may do so," said Leon. "But
if you say a word about us you are a
dead man."
The strange ship .hauled her yard
aback when she saw that the other
wished to speak her. and the two lay
rolling in the Atlantic swell within
a hundred yards of each other.
"We are the Friend â of 'Liverpool,"
cried an officer. "Who are you?"
"We are the Louisa, seven days out
from Dieppe for Valparaiso," answered
the unhappy mate, repeating what
the mutineers whispered to him. The
longitude was asked and given, and
the two vessels parted company. With
yearning eyes the harassed man looked
at the orderly decks and the well
served officer of the Liverpool ship.
while he in turn noticed with surprise
those signs of careless handling which
would strike the eye of a sailor in the
rig and management of the Flowewy
Land. Soon the vessel was hull down
upon the horizon and in an hour, the
guilty ship was again alone in the vast
ring of the ocean.
This meeting was very nearly being
a fatal one to the mate, for it took all
Leon's influence to convince the other
ignorant and suspicious seamen that
they had not been betrayed. But a
more dangerous time still was before
him. It must have been evident to him
that when they had made their landfall
then was the time when he was no
longer necessary to the crew and when
they were likely to silence him forever.
That which was their goal was likely
to prove his death warrant.
Every day brought him nearer to this
Inevitable crisis, and then at last on
the night of the 2d of October the look
out man reported land ahead. The
ship was at once put about, and in the
morning the South American coast was
a dim haze upon the western horizon.
When the mate came upon deck he
found the mutineers in earnest con
clave about the forehatch, and their
looks and gestures told him that it was
his fate which was being debated. Leon
-was again on the side of mercy. "If
you like to kill the carpenter and the
mate, you can: I shall not doit." said
he. There was a sharp difference of
opinion upon the matter, and the poor,
helpless mate waited like a sheep near
a knot of butchers.
"What are they going to do with
me?" he cried to Leon, but received no
reply. "Are they going to kill me?" he
asked Marsollno.
"I am not, but Blanco is," was the
discouraging reply.
However, the thoughts of the muti
neers were happily diverted by other
things. First, they clewed up the sails
and dropped the boats alongside. The
mate having been deposed from his
command there . was no commander at
all. so that everything was chaos. Some
got into the boats and some remained
upon the decks of- the vessel. The mate
found himself in one boat, which con
tained Watto. Paul the Sclavonlan,
Early, the ship's boy. and the Chinese
cook. They rowed a hundred yards
away from the ship, but were recalled
by Blanco and . Leon. It shows how
absolutely - the honest men had lost
their spirit; that though they were four
to one in this particular boat they
meekly : returned when they were re
called. ' _,'â "'-- _7-
The' Chinese cook was ordered on
deck, and the others were allowed to
float astern. The unfortunate steward
had descended Into another boat, -but
Duranno pushed him overboard. .He
swam for a long time, bepgihg hard for
his life, but "Leon and Duranno pelted

from the deck until one of them struck
him on the head and sent him to tha
bottom. The same men took Cassap,
the little Chines^ boy. into the cabin.
Candereau, the French sailor, heard
him cry out. "Finish me quickly then'"
and they were the last words that he
ever spoke. ..' .."r-. â 
â  In the meantime the carpenter had
been led Into the hold by the other mu
tineers and ordered to scuttle thÂ» ship.
He bored four holes forward and four
aft, and the water began to pour In.
The crew sprang into the boats, one
small one and one large one. the former

thoughtless were they that they were

well laden with plunder, made slowly
for the shore. - - ,- r. 'â¢ '**
It was 4 In the afternoon upon the
4th of October that they ran their boats
upon the South American beach.. It
was a desolate spot, so they . tramped
inland, rolling along 'with the gait of
seamen ashore, their bundles .upon
their shoulders. Their story was that,
they were the shipwrecked crew of an
American ship from Peru to Bordeaux.
She had foundered a hundred miles out,
and - the captain and - officers were in
another boat which had parted com
pany. They had been five days and
nichts upon the sea.
Toward evening they came upon the
estancla of a lonely farmer, to -whom
they told their tale, and from whom
they received every hospitality. Next
day â¢hey were all driven over to the
nearest town of Rocha. Candereau and
the mate got an opportunity, of escap
ing that night, and within twenty-four .
hours their story had beer, told to the
authorities, and the mutineers were all
in the hands of the police.
Of the twenty .men who had started
from London in the Flowery Land six
had' met their deaths from violence.
There remained fourteen, of whom
eight were, mutineers and six were des
tined to be the witnesses against them.
No more striking example could be
given of the long arm and steel hand
of the British law than that within a
very few* months this mixed erew â
Sclavonlan, negro, Manila ' men, Nor
wegian. Turk and Frenchman â gath
ered on the shore of the distant Ar
gentine were all brought face to face at
the Central Criminal Court in the heart
of London town.
The trial excited great attention on
account of the singular crew and the
monstrous nature of their crimes. The
death of the officers did less to rouse
the prejudice of the public and to in
fluence the jury than the callous mur
der.of the unoffending Chinaman. The
great difficulty was that of apportion
ing the blame among so many men and
of determining which had realty been
active in the shedding of blood. Taf

In the spring the Sacramento gets up sometimes. the theoretical

â¢millions of horse-power. All the machinery in America would pro
vide a small Job for all the Sierra Nevada s streams
The western slope of the Sierra Nevadas sends down an aver
age annual water supply of 1,757,028,240,000 cubic feet, but it runs away
and people want rain. The Sacramento River drains off enough wa
ter yearly to flood that valley ten feet deep.
THERE are some remarkable things
to be told about California waters,
and the recent movement to do .
something toward saving and us- ,
ing them makes their telling
timely.
There Is ln general hut a very
Blight conception of the significance and .
the possibilities of the swarm of streams .
that ceaselessly rush down the mountain
slopes of the State to find the restless sea.
Few would guess that tho Sacramento
and San Joaquin would make three Niag
aras, when the spring floods have gather- '
ed In their channels, and that the incon
ceivable power generated by these waters
in their descent would turn every wheel
In America and leave a few million horse
power for Europe. t
These mountain streams are nature s
greatest gift to California, and the one
most lavishly wasted. There is a wide
difference between the theoretical and the
practicable possibilities of a water supply,
but the former are easier dealt with on
paper and they illustrate the latter.
The "floor" of the great central valley
of the Stateâ the comparatively level plain
bounded by the base line of the foothills
âis 15,709 square miles in area. Of this
the floor of the San Joaquin Valley occu
pies 11,513 square miles, and the floor of
the Sacramento Valley 4196 square miles.
Now the water that flows through the
Sacramento Valley, taking the average
discharge of the Sacramento River for a
period of years, would yearly cover the
floor of this valley to a depth of 10.22 feet.
The average annual discharge of the San
Joaquin River system would similarly Â«
cover the floor of that valley to a depth
of about a foot and a half. The total
average discharge of both rivers would
cover the two valley floors to a depth of
about four feet.
It is not easy to comprehend the vast
volume of water that pours through this
central valley." Most of lt comes down
the western slope of the Sierra Nevada
Range, through thickly set water courses
that are wild and deep. The streams
pause and muster below, and all meet In
Suisun Bay. The whole drainage area Is
56.213 square miles, more than the area
of the State of New New York. At times
of greatest flood the streams . draining
through this central valley are estimated
to discharge a total of about 1,080,000 cubla
feet per second. The estimated average
discharge of the Niagara River is 275,000
cubic feet per second, or a little more
than a quarter of what all of the Interior
streams of California could show at their
best. This does not mean that anything
like this amount of water reaches the
lower courses of the Sacramento and San,
Joaquin. It ls merely an aggregate of
the estimated maximum floods of all the
streams, little and big.
The figures used in this article are
taken mainly from the reports of State
Engineer W. Ham Hall for 1880 and other
years of that period when an extensive
study of the State's water problems was
made. The estimates were largely made
by C. F. Grunsky and Marsden Manson,
two eminent engineers of the State. Other
data is afforded by reports of Government
engineers.
Taking the average of dry and wet sea
sons, the Sacramento River discharges
about 1.197,300,000,000 cubic feet a year. If
this water were put in a tank one mile
square at the base, the tank would have
to be over eight miles high.
This Is not very much, either, for In
many years the river beats this record by
a few hundred billion cubic feet. For the
whole year 1879-80 the average discharge
was 44.370 cubic, feet per second, and the
estimated quantity 1,402,886,000,000 cubic
feet. !
The Sacramento discharges between
three and four times as much water as
the San Joaquin. * Measurements or estl-j
mates of the flow of the separate streams
of the San Joaquin system where they
enter the valley show an average aggre
gate of 16,083 cubic feet 'per second. A
number of the smaller streams run dry
in summer; the average for the period of
August, September and October Is 3,927
cubic feet per second, while * for May,
June and July lt ls 40,4... The San Joaquin
valley receives an average yearly flow of
water from the. Sierra Nevada slope of
507,729,600,000 cubic feet, which, would,
cover an area of 18,248 square miles one
foot deep. *' 'â¢
The whole western slope of the Sierra
Nevada range pours into the central val
ley an average mean yearly flow of 55,715
cubic feet per second, less the small flow
of Coast Range Creek, and this means
that tHe mountains give to the central
valley an average annual supply of 1,757,
--028,240,000 cubic feet, or enough to cover
an area of 63,024 square miles . one foot
deep. yy":
That looks like plenty of water If It
could be saved up and distributed when
and where It would do the most good.
As things are now, lt does much harm
while doing ' little good. The fall and
spring floods that rush down over the
lowlands work - tremendous devastation.
The lands subject to submergence at
extreme "high water are estimated at
2750 square miles, or more than the area
of Delaware, and every, acre of these
lands is marvelously fertile. 7*"-
The most* striking feature of all this
magnificent water supply is the Incon
ceivable power-latent in It. The might
as well as the majesty, of Niagara has
been the wonder of the world.: The Ni
agara is a babe beside the mighty Sacra
mento in its potentiality, though no one
would guess It to look at the- dirty, lazy
California stream and then at the awe
inspiring cataract.
It is estimated that Niagara has a the
oretical power, of 7,000,000 horsepower, of
which several hundred â¢ thousand horse
power can be practically used. Accord
ing to eminent authority there is now In
use within a radius of 400 miles of the
falls 2,733,000 horsepower by : a population
of ,11,150,000 people. This Includes the great
manufacturing region of America. Within
a radius of 300 miles there is in use
1.967.000 horsepower by a population of
8,246,000.7 It is estimated that the theo
retical power of the falls Is equal to that
of* all the coal mined In the world dally
about 200.000 tons.
Now let us look at the Sacramento. The
great bulk of Its- water comes from the
high altitudes of the Sierra Nevadas. The
valley rainfall is low. It increases with
altitude until over a long portion of the
range It exceeds 60 Inches. The average
height; of the range is over. 8000 feet. These
mountain tops are storm gatherers,; and
the snows are piled deep.. . The drainage
area. of the Sacramento basin Is 26,187
square miles. The valley Itself occupies
but 4200 square miles. As most of the
water comes from high regions, it would
be a conservative estimate to assume that
all the water of the Sacramento comes
from an average elevation of 4500 feet. *-..
: Electrical" engineers assume that one
miner's inch of water, or one and one-half
cubic feet a minute falling 450 feet, will
produce one horse-power. If the average
annual flow of the Sacramentoâ 37,632 cu
bic feet per secondâ be assumed to come
from a height of 4500 feet, we have pro
duced 15,052,800' horse-power.. "With the
conservative assumptions here used, we
have in the Sacramento a steady average
potentiality year in and year out that is
moie than double that of Niagara. wan
Francisco uses 60,000 horse-power, at a
yearly cost of $7,200,000. At the value of
$100 a year per horse-power, we find the
Sacramento to be worth at least $1,505,280,
--000 a year for power alone if it could all
be used and sold. This is just the Sacra
mento and Its tributaries taken together.
The San Joaquin system is also mighty to
the extent of a few million horse-power.
The Yuba Is fourth In importance among
the streams that feed the Sacramento, but
it will do for an illustration. It drains an
area of 1329 square miles, and Its head
waters turn the big stamp mills of Ne
vada City and Grass Valley, supply towns
and Irrigate orchards, with small tax on
Its abilities. Like all those streams, its
volume varies greatly. Its extreme low
stage Is 500 cubic feet a second, Its mean
discharge perhaps 1500 cubic feet a second,
and in flood It runs 26,000 cubic feet a sec
ond. Thirty miles above the junction with
the Feather Its altitude is 2650 feet and
its grade 56 feet to the mile. It drains
high areas of Nevada, Sierra and Yuba
Counties. Now this little Yuba, when It
is flooded and discharging 2600 feet a sec
ond is generating a theoretical force of
10 350,000 horse-power, or 50 per cent more
than Niagara Falls. This Is on the as
sumption that all Its water falls on an
average 4500 feet.
The practicability of using economically
this Inconceivable reservoir of power is
another matter,' but nowhere on earth is
there so much available water power so
widely distributed. Nature seems to have
planned those mountains to that end.
High in the mountains are strung for 300
miles clustering lakes without number,
often set in amphitheaters of which the
exits may be dammed. Other amphlthe
ters are natural reservoir sites.. When he
was State Engineer, W. Ham Hall lo
cated seventy-three reservoir sites. The
United Stale's Geological Survey has lo
cated forty-four. California is already
the world's greatest field for electric
power transmission and holds the record
for distance at 80 miles. Power plants
will steadily multiply. Power is already
being brought to Stockton ,from the
mountains, and , an lnflnitesimally small
part of that mountain power will soon be
turning wheels in San Francisco.

ends of which water can be easily taken
to secure a good fall. Nature bore does
a good deal toward storing water. It Is
stored in the form of snow, which melts
gradually later, and there are a great
many lakes and reservoir; sites which of
fer storage at high altitudes. ' In develop
ing water power- it Is easier to store and
control a small amount of water with a
high fall than a large amount with a low
fall. The Installation of high-head plants
Is cheaper than the Installation of low

peculiarly favorable to the development
of electric power."
All this affords a graphic hint of the
possibilities of California waters. The
coast streams and those of Southern Cal
ifornia have mighty potentialities and
promises. In Lassen County, on the east
ern slope of the Sierra Nevadas, Is- Eagle
Lake, altitude 6115 feet, 1500 feet deep,
covering 85,000 acres and storing water
enough to Irrigate 600,000 acres of now
worthless lands lying below It that will
be rich when water comes. A 7,000-foot
tunnel is needed. Tahoe has a mighty
future, when, if ever, a tunnel shall tap Its
vast store of water at an altitude of 6,200
feet , and allow the water to be flumed
to where It can be used at high pressure.
The Yuba Water Company is ready to
supply power for a Holyoke near Cape
Horn.
The Sierra Nevada Mountains thus sup
ply enough water to flood the central val
ley of the State four feet deep yearly,
generate the power of several Niagaras
and provide the means for storing its
waters and for preventing or easing the
floods. It is estimated that in these two
valleys there are 12,000,000 acres of irri
gable land, easy to irrigate and that for
every square mile of Irrigable land there
are three and one-half square miles of
watershed with abundant rainfall.

the consummation of a very pic

of practical sentimentality in these pro
saic days. When Joseph B. Stevens and
Nellie Marshall were joined in wedlock on
the 21st Of last month another chapter
was added to a latter-day love story that
would be a veritable gem In the hands of
a literary artist. The philosophers who

the little affair of two hearts herewith
narrated. - *..'-'â '.â¢*â¢'â 
The time of the opening act In this ro
mance was the winter of 1894-95. The
scene was the brown-painted wooden
orange-packing house of. the Fruit Grow
ers' Exchange at Azusa. The beginning
was prosaic enough. Hundreds of people
have done the same thing before, but
none ever had the romantic turn that this
act of , Miss Nellie Marshall's had.
Among the residents In the foothill
hamlet of Glendora, close to Azusa, in
Los Angeles County, several years ago
was Mrs. Agnes Marshall, widow of John
P. Marshall. She had two daughters,
Nellie and Emma, aged 15 and 13 respec
tively. Mrs. Marshall had a few, acres of
Intractable land near the foothills and a
pension of an army veteran's widow. She
and her daughters had comÂ© from Kansas
City during 1890, shortly after Mr. Mar
shall's death.
Miss Nellie Marshall was a particularly
prepossessing girl. W hen she lived in
Kansas City, a child in short dresses, she
was queen of a school children's carnival,
and her rosy cheeks and sparkling black
eyes made her beauty remarked wherever
her mother took her. Among all the girls
In the eastern end of San Gabriel Valleyâ
Indeed, all that regionâ Nellie Marshall
was the undisputed beauty. But she
never seemed to know that. Her fresh
pink and white complexion, her chic little
chin, her wealth of hairâ black as a
raven's wingâ her soft, gentle expression,
her big, brilliant dark eyes, and especially
her graceful, petite ways were the chief
elements of her attractiveness. But her
beaming good-nature, her jollity and her

The state chamber In the Waldorf-
Astoria is the most costly in the house.
It is not of great size, but in magnificence
rivals the most famous bedchambers of
European palaces. "V.y.
The room is furnished and decorated
in the style of Francis I. The four-poster
bedstead, with Its canopy, is an exact re
production in walnut of the original in
the museum at Cluny. The cost of the
bed alone. is $3500. The prie dleu in the
room cost $1000. Draperies, carpets, tapes
tries and paintings frame ln rare bric-a
brac and make the room one of beauty
and splendor. .
Meanwhile the couple from New Eng
land were serenely content in their quar
ters at the Waldorf-Astoria. A pretty,
bright room, with adjoining bath and all
modern conveniences, cost them $4 a day.
Three meals, ordered Judiciously from the
elaborate menu, amounted to $6. The
combined tips of husband and -wife
reached the sum of $1, making a total of
$11.

These two young people enjoyed the
public dining-room. Seeing well-dressed
guests at table was one of the sights of
their trips. There were music, lights and'
flowers galore in the hotel, which they
were at as much liberty to enjoy for their
$11 as the Western pair for their $700.
musical laugh made her even more pleas
ing among all who knew her.
Once when she was in Los Angeles on a
visit a florist, who had designed a chariot J
of red roses arid white carnations for the
great floral parade during la fiesta week,
vainly begged, pursued and finally offered
a good-sized sum of money to Nellie Mar
shall to ride In his floral chariot during
the parades, and thereby add to the at
tractiveness of the display.
The widow Marshall and . her two
-daughters, found their foothill property
unproductive without irrigation, and they
had no money to buy water with. Times
grew harder and more serious with the
little family. The girls left school and
went to work to do their share toward
paying off _ the mortgage on the home
place. The mother got out to work
with her horse and plow to save a man's
hire. Nellie* and Emma worked in the
apricot and prune drying yards in the
fall of 1894. They were -nimble workers,
and, throwing their whole soul into their
work, they each earned 75 cents a day at
cutting fruit and arranging it on the
wooden trays for drying out in the sun
shine.
When the orange harvesting season
came on ln January Nellie, like nearly all
the country girls In the locality, went
over to Azusa to pack oranges. For weeks
the Marshall family had looked forward
to that time, and it was considered a
thankful boon which the fruit shippers
were granting in permitting Nellie to
earn a few dollars there. By, faithful
work and deftness ln handling and wrap
ping the fruit and then "-placing it in a
box, according to Its particular size, the
girl could earn sometimes $1 a day. For
weeks she rose six days in the week at
5 o'clock, walked two miles to the pack
ing house, ate a cold bite of a meal out
of her basket at noon, and walked home
at night.
But there were times of jollity and joke
ln the orange packing house. Once dur
ing the noon hour while the girls were
resting some one proposed that lt would
be fun to write a lot of humorous and
sentimental messages on bits of paper
and to wrap the same ln with the oranges
they were that day packing for the East
ern markets. Some of the girls had heard
of such things, and it appealed to their
sense of a lark. The scheme was dis
cussed in whispers among the stacks of
orange boxes and the heaps of oranges.
Of course the foreman must not know the
girls' scheme, much less the superintend
ent at the packing house.
Several girls got pencils and wrote la
conic messages, as funny as they knew
how, on tiny pieces of paper. One or two
wrote couplets they remembered having
seen on valentines. The messages and
sentiments were signed by genuine or fic
titious names. That afternoon the little
papers bearing' the schoolgirl penmanship
were one by one stealthily tucked in
among the oranges and their tissue paper
wrappers.
Nellie Marshall was in the scheme.
She always participated in any girlish
lark projected In her bailiwick. She
wrote a dozen or a score of notes, all
substantially the same, as follows:
"These oranges were packed by a ro
mantic girl in the wild and woolly West.
If you wish- further information let Nel
lie Marshall, Azusa, Cal., know It."
The oranges went away in a carload lot
the following day, and in a few days the
girls In the packing house forgot about
their message-writing lark. Once *or
twice during the season other messagesâ
sometimes bits of comic verse, sometimes
a bit of innocent fun and other times ad
dresses onlyâ were written, and, unknown
to the foreman, were tucked In with the
packed oranges. *.'.-. yy :-', '"â¢; â â ' ; "
The days of the orange shipments pass
ed. Carload after carload of the fruit
rolled away to the East. Winter merged
into spring. The girls at the packing
house never spoke more of the notes they
had sent to market with the oranges.
The season was drawing to a close. Nel
lie Marshall had left the packing, house
and had gone home to the Glendora ranch
to help her ill" mother.
Among the advertised letters at the
Azusa postoffice one day in May was a
letter for Miss Nellie Marshall. When It
was brought to the foothill home over at
Glendora every one there was surprised to
find that It was from one Joseph B. Stev
ens of Rochester, N. Y. -
Then the secret of the messages that,
the girls In the packing house had writ
ten for fun was recalled and told. Mr.
Stevens wrote that he had bought some
Los Angeles oranges, and among them
was a note from Nellie Marshall. His
curiosity was aroused, inasmuch as he
had relatives' in Pasadena, and he had
spent a winter In the San Gabriel Valley
a year previous. He politely asked " the
Information vouchsafed in the note he
had found wrapped among his oranges.
Now some conventional girls would
have tossed the letter from a stranger
Into the fire, and have blushed at the
memory of a schoolgirl epistolatory larK
Some mothers would have reprimanded
their daughters for writing notes Indis
, criminately to people. But Nellie Marshall
believed she saw an. honest young man
back of the letter she., had, and her
mother, after some mental debate, saw no
harm in at least a civil message n â¢, n f '
ing receipt, of _ a letter from 3000 miles
away. 'â¢'- â â '". '*. â~_.-â
From that a regular correspondence
grew. At- flrst the letters- were brief ana
formal. Mr. Stevens, gave references as
to his reputation and family. He tola or
people, in Pasadena who* had known him
from his birth, and his parents for yea"
before that. When the summer of 1895
had slid into fall the letters between tho
little white house on the foothill ranch
and Rochester, N. V., became more fre
quent. Photographs were exchanged, and
at once there came a big fat letter with a
row of postage stamps upon the envelope,
showing that the correspondent in Roch
ester was charmed at the picture of his
California correspondent. â  "<â¢â 
Very quickly a cousin of Mr. Stevens
drove out from Pasadena and called upon
the Marshalls. Then the Marshalls were
invited to visit in Pasadena. Meanwhile
the mails between Glendora and Roches
ter were not neglected. Important let
ters shuttled also between Pasadena and
Rochester. More photographs were ex
changed and then came the period of gift
making.
In the winter of 1895-96 Mrs. Marshall
and her daughters sold their foothill
home and moved to Los Angeles, where
Miss Nellie became a clerk in a candy
store. Mr. Stevens came to Southern Cali
fornia, on a flying trip between his pro
fessional duties. One of the carriage
rides he took with Miss Marshall was a
drive to Azusa to the orange packing
house, where his flrst message among the
oranges a year before had he-en written.
When Mr. Stevens went back to Roches
ter he left a solitaire diamond ring on
the hand of his fiancee.
The course of true love, as the poet
says, never did run true. In this case it
ran over boulders so huge and surged
curves so sharp that many a stream of
love would have spent itself among the
rocks before it reached the broad and
smooth river of matrimony. Mr. Ste
vens* parents had hopes for marriage in
another direction, and both they and Mrs.
Marshall objected to a marriage with a
young lady under 18. Some impatient let
ters went between Los Angeles and Roch
ester. Then the letters grew more infre
quent. Then shorter. Finally they
ceased, and there was a return of former
gifts. Each resolved to forget the other,
and each thought their romance closed.
Mr. Stevens inherited a large fortune in
the fall of 1896, and he went to Europe
with bis sisters. While in Italy In the.
winter of 1896-97 he met an old school-*
mate of his from Rochester, who was
traveling with her parents. . Before he left
for America he was engaged to marry
her. Meanwhile Mrs. Marshall had died
and her daughters went to live in the
family of an uncle in Ventura, where
Miss Nellie was employed in the â¢fflce of
a nursery concern.
The marriage of Mr. Stevens and his
affianced was fixed for the early summer
of 1897. He built a beautiful home at Vlck
Park, in Rochester,- and was planning for
Its furnishing with all that. wealth could
buy, when his promised bride took 111 and
died with pneumonia. He was almost
crazed with grief, fHe went to Mexico
and Cuba and sold the home he had built.
A year ago he came out to Los An
geles. Very naturally his mind went back
to his last former visit in .Southern Cali
fornia. His relatives in Pasadena told
him they had lost track of Miss Nellie
Marshall after she" had moved away from
Los Angeles. The candy-store where she
was once employed behind the counter
had changed hands, and no one there
could answer Mr. Stevens' adroit ques
tions concerning Miss Marshall. Some one
said she had married and moved away to
San Francisco.
He had given up his quest (for simple
curiosity) after Miss Marshall, when he
happened to run across a picture of her
In a showcase In a photographer's gal
lery. All his old-time love came surging
back. He renewed his inquiries and he
came across a friend whom he had piet
In Los Angeles two years before,, and
then he learned that Miss Marshall was
In Ventura. . : . "
The next chapter In the romance covers
several, weeks In the spring of 1888. Mr.
Stevens ' .went to. .Ventura and wandered
about the town until he met Miss Mar
shall. He renewed his suit and was final
ly accepted. Miss Marshall visited at the
home of his relatives in Pasadena. A
date for the wedding was set last June, i
but suddenly there came the news of the-*
death of Mr. Stevens' .-brother, with
Shafter in Cuba," and he had to hasten to
Florida. ' â¢..-*-*-
Letters passed between" Pasadena and
Rochester daily for -weeks. Mr. Stevens
planned a dozen times to ! come to Cali
fornia and claim his bride, but he had
securities that the war demanded his con
stant watching. 7:. Last. November Miss
Marshall and her sister, went East to
visit an aunt at Rose, N. Y. There Mis*.
Marshall was stricken with the grip early
in December,; and for weeks she was
alarmingly ill. -
She recovered measurably in February,
and at the earliest opportunity she and
Mr. Stevens were married. It was a sim
ple wedding at the home of the bride's
aunt on a New' York farm. In the* hour
of their joy the bride and groom did not
forget the romantic way they became ac
quainted." Amid the many..telegrams of

TO MAKE
RAIN
LAST week Professor Lowe asked the Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce to pay the charges in his attempt to ' break the
drought in that vicinity by artificial means. Called before the
chamber to explain what he proposed doing to produce the
much-needed rain he said he would Ignite gases and high ex
plosives in the air and by condensation produce rain. Professor Lowe
stated that 58000 would cover the cost of the explosives required and
also furnish a plant that might be used in the future. His offer was
taken under advisement. < /._-
The proposition he made again brings forward the arguments and
demonstrations of the "rain- makers" of the past decade. * Professor
Lowe is a stanch advocate of the plan. Below will "be found the
Story of the experiments and studies he made to arrive at his conclu
sions and also the ideas of eminent professors on the same subject â
rain-making.
LOS ANGELES, March Can ra n
be artificially produced in South- S
crn California? is the leading topic
which engrosses all manner of
men.* Its solution, in a way to
prove the contentions favoring the
theories declaring its possibility, would be
of untold value to this region.
The declaration that Professor T. 8. C.
Lowe of Mount Lowe makes, that rain
can be produced by the employment of
scientific apparatus of his own designing,
has created a discussion In this land of
sunshine that is aching for rain that will
not subside until the experiment has
shown that he is right or that his deduc
tions are wrong.
Opinion is divided as to the practicabil
ity of Professor Lowe's novel plans, but
ln that he has an advantage over rftany
other scientific savants before him, and
now over many of his 'earlier experiences,
In that he is not alone In his belief.
The Chamber of Commerce has taken up
the question of attempting to produce
rain by artificial means, in the hope that
moisture may be produced to relieve the
thousands of dry acres In vine, fruit and
grain.
Professor Lowe tells the Chamber of
Commerce that it is flulte possible to pro
duce rain by artificial means when the
â¢atmospheric conditions are favorable, as
they are oftener than there Is need of a
downpour. : 'â 'â / "V
In order to produce moisture Professor
lx>we says that he would apply his own .
â ystem of aeronautics with additions of
detonating and gaseous explosion, so de
signed to change, the upper atmosphere rs
to force together the elements, which un
der natural conditions result In rainfall.
Professor Lowe was called upon by the
Chamber of Commerce for a statement of
DR. EISEN DECLARES THE IDEfI IMPRAC
TIC^BLE.
"How can you get moisture cut of ths air' when
there is no moisture in it? If there is more mois
ture in the air than it will hold at a certain ter
n" perature it will fall in the form ct rain. I 1
the air is warm and full of water if will b<"
. precipitated if suddenly cooled. But thir
- cooling cannot be done by artificial
- means except, possibly, to a very iim
ited extent. The explosion of a few
thousand pounds of powder in
the expanse of the upper
. stratum of atmosphere
. would have no more ef
- feet on general condi
tions than a fire
' cracker exploded
in the bay would
have on the

In reply to numerous adverse criticisms
Professor Lowe says that a notable In
stance of artificial rain was the battle, of
Buena Vista, which was fought in the
midst of the dry season in Mexico and
there had been no . rain for many
months before the battle. The occur
rences upon the second day at Buena Vis
ta, as stated by Brevet Major General
H. W. Benham of the United States En
gineer Corps, were: "From 8 to 9 in the
morning of that day the artillery was en
gaged in heavy cannonading, after which
between 11 and 12 o'clock a most violent
shower of rain fell.
"And what was positive proof to me
that these rains were the direct result of
the artillery firing," writes General .Ben
ham, "was that no rain had fallen, as I
was informed, for a number of months
before this battleâ l was told eight
months; and none fell for three months
after .the battle, which I knew was the
case, as I remained at the same station
during that time.
"The battles of Palo Alto, Molino del
Bey. Chcrubusco, Monterey and Chapul

and each was followed by heavy rains."

high as 99 without precipitation."
Professor Lowe in making the foregoing
statement lias put himself in opposition
to the leading university men throughout
the State. Not a single physicist inclines
to his theory of rain-making. "
Professor Claypoole and others of
Throop 'University at Pasadena denounce
the theory as baseless. The professor
said: "I think if you could know about"
the great battles of -the world and their
effect upon the atmosphere you would
find that rain has not in nearly every
case followed the roar of battle, and that
when such has been the case rain would
have fallen if there had been no battle.
It is impossible to produce rain just
when we want it. When the air is dry
artificial means will not create moisture.
Anybody that professes to be able to do
this is a quack.''
Said Professor Jordan of Stanford:
"From the newspaper notes, nothing is
suggested that could have the slightest
effect in bringing on a storm. The ex
plosion of all the gunpowder in the world
would not do this, though by disturbing
or heating the atmosphere it might keep
off a storm five minutes. In a general
way, as has been shown, the effect of
explosions on the movement of a storm
Is about as great as a jumping flea would
be on the movements of a steamer.
"I should not wish .to condemn Mr.
Lowe's scheme without knowing what It
is. If it Is once tried it. will no doubt
condemn itself."
Professor Fernando Sanford. head of
the department of physics, who is one
of the leading authorities of the â¢country
on this subject of rain-making, said: "I
know nothing of the details of Mr.
Lowe's plan for producing rain. I do
know, however, that all such schemes
are fakes."
Professor Sanford then named over a
number of the best known fiascos in rain
making. Among these, is the Baker fake,
at Pixley. Callfornia/Tri 15.., and the Py
renforth scheme for artificial rain-making
tried at San Antonio, Texas, November
25, 1892.
"To acompllsh the desired result in the
latter case," said Professor Sanford, "the
temperature of the air was raised by
heat-producing explosives. Eight bal
loons. 150 shells and 4000 pounds of rosel
lite were fired off. No rain appeared.
One balloon exploded within a black rain
cloud, but failed to produce any precipi
tation.
"On the following Wednesday, with a
clear sky. ten balloons, 175 shells ami
5000 pounds of rosellite were exploded and
the sky remained clear.
"On the following night the remaining
stock of explosives were fired off, regard
less of consequences, to get rid of tnem."
Frederick Slate, professor of physics in
the University of California, offered the
following opinion of artificial rain-mak
ing: V * v
"Do I think the theory of producing rain
by explosive balloons feasible? Judging
by the recent experiments in Texas, it
would seem not. There, you will remem
ber, a reward even was offered If the
scheme tried should work. But we all
know It failed most signally, and in itself
that ought to be a sufficient answer to.
such inquiries. The experiments were
conducted under quite favorable circum
stances and the generally . accepted
elusion is that they were a; failure. Gen
erally speaking. I should, say that the
idea is not feasible; that is, for all prac
tical conditions."
"Can you Imagine conditions in which
explosive balloons might be effective for
producing rain?" 7.7"
"Tes; as far as that goes, they can be
imagined very easily, but they are hardly
ever likely to exist.
"Of course such conditions coma exist
as well in California as any where else,
but they are not the conditions which
would explain the present scarcity of
rain. Our rain comes to us from storm
clouds which pass over the State in an
easterly direction, or rather in a south
easterly direction. It not infrequently
happens that some disturbing influence
produces an oscillation in their path
which deflects them to the north. What
the disturbing influence is we have no
means of finding out. It may possibly
turn thorn toward the extreme south. in
which case also we should be deprived
of rain. But It is very easy to see that
no explosive balloon can change the os
cillation of the storm currents.
"In cases of supersaturatlon In a per
fectly' homogeneous body the Introduction
of an outside' substance may form a cen
ter of precipitation. For instance, take
any jar containing a solution of salt in
such proportion as to amount to a super
saturation. If we are able to keep the
solution* homogeneous throughout, with
out any jarring or. sudden lowering of
temperature, the salt will not crystallize.
It is even possible, provided the solution
be kept perfectly homogeneous, to lower
Its temperature a great deal without In
ducing any change. If, however, a for
eign substance were suddenly Introduced,
for Instance a small crystal, it would
form Instantly what is termed a center of
precipitation and the salt would go to
the bottom. In the same way we might
imagine . atmospheric conditions- which
were perfectly homogeneous throughout,
without any disturbing Influence what
ever, from wind or jar of any kind. Then
under such circumstances an explosive
balloon* or the firing of guns might
make centers of precipitation which
would start a fall of rain. The conditions,
however, are improbable to the highest
degree. ,
"The old stories of rain falling after bat
tles are nothing but popular supersti
tions." ; - " ... . -. .' ',-.. â ' .
"Is there, then, no relation of cause
and effect between the heavy firing dur
ing a battle and the fall of rain after
ward?" - - "â  â¢'â â â 
"That would be incautious to say. But
most probably there is not. It is really
nothing but a popular superstition which
the Texas experiments ought surely to
disprove." - . <>:â 
Gustav Risen. Ph.D.. of the Academy of
Sciences, said the- whole idea was laugh
able In the extreme and had really been
disproved long ago. In speaking of the
matter he said:
"How can you get moisture out of the
air when there is no moisture in it? II
there is more moisture in the air than it
will hold at a certain temperature it will
fall In the form of rain. If the air Is
warm and full of water It will be precip
itated if suddenly cooled. But this cool
ing cannot be. done by artificial means ex
cept, possibly!' to a very limited extent.
The explosion of a few thousand pounds
of powder in the expanse of the upper
stratum of atmosphere would have no
more effect on general conditions than a
firecracker exploded In the bay would
have on the tides."
So as the case. stands Professor Lowe
Is in a position to make himself famousâ
that is, provided his scheme works.

WITH mv niece Lucy and my nephew Jack I was on my way to
St. Petersburg. I had spent a part of a summer in that water
soaked city; had shown my passport until it was a mere shred;
had sworn to my nationality and age times without number,
and had stood up against a gendarme who found me talking
to a beggar. I had given him a few kopeks and was asking
him his name, when the awful voice of the gendarme said to me: "I can
tell you. It Isâ" â¢ ,_.,,*â _
I didn't catch it. I only heard the words: "We have been looking for
him some time. Come with me!"
This last to the poor wretch, whose face took on a different expression
from the one it had worn when he asked me for alms. Then it was the
face of a peasant; now it was that of a man resolute and defiant, but re
fined and educated, He had been playing a hazardous game and had lost.
He was a prisoner with no means of escape. . Offering me the kopeks I
had given him, he said, in excellent English: "Thank you. lady, but I
shan't need them where I am going. Write to No. , Nevsky, and tell
her 1 have been arrested."
The gendarme sternly demanded to know what he said. I told him
all. except that I was to write to No. , on the Nevsky. There was a
gleam of intense satisfaction in the man's eyes, which thanked me more
lhan words could have done, and then he was marched toward the gloomy
fortress. In my excitement I grasped his hand with a "Good-by, and God
pity you!"
It was a bold thing to do, but I felt no fear. I could speak Russian
fluently; I was an American, and wore the colors of my country in a knot
cf ribbon on my dress, and knew this badge protected me quite as much
as my passport, and that afternoon I wrote my letter, with no clew to
guide me as to the person I was to address except the word her. It was
a woman, and I addressed her as "Madame" and told her the particulars
of the arrest, and hired a messenger to deliver my note at No. ,
Nevsky prospect. Three weeks later I read that several Nihilists were to
start for Siberia that day. Something told me that my beggar was among
them, and 1 wrote down the number of his house and the date of departure
for Siberia, and put them with the kopeks I bad given him as souvenirs
of mv adventure with the Russian gendarmes.
_______ *â¢_**â¢-_
Ten years later I was again en route for St. Petersburg with my
nephew "and niece. Lucy was anxious to see the Czarina and Jack to see
the fortress and a Nihilist. Our only companion across the country to
the frontier whs a young lady â Russianâ who gave her name as Sophie
Scholaskle. She had been at school in London two years, she said, and
this accounted for her fluent English. Her mother was a widow, who lived
in St. Petersburg, and her twin brother, Ivan, was in Paris, at the Bon
Ma re he.
"We look very much alike." she said, "although he Is small for a man.
and I am big for a woman. We can wear each other's gloves." and she
held up two large white hands. "Number seven and very strong," she
continued, opening and shutting them rapidly.
She was very communicative, and before we reached the frontier we
knew that her grandfather had been one of the minor nobility at the time
of the emancipation act, by which he lost his serfs and a portion of his
land. After that he migrated to the city, where he received an office
under the Government. His home was on the Nevsky, where she was
born, for her father and grandfather lived together untilâ She hesitated
a moment: then added: "I lost both my father and my grandfather. We
gave up our house on the Nevsky, and now live in apartments."
We were at the frontier by this time, where some of her friends met
her. and we saw no more of her until we reached St. Petersburg, where
we met her again as we were struggling with our baggage and the porters
and officials. Some of them seemed to know her, for, at a word I did not
catch, we were at once attended to and were soon at our hotel.
Those first days in the city were full of interest, even to me, who had
seen everything worth seeing ten years before. The enthusiasm of the
young people aroused a like feeling In me. and I went wherever they
wished to go. whether to St. Isaac's, or the Winter Palace, or No. , on
the Nevskv, where I had hard work to keep Jack from ringing the bell
and asking if the man sent to Siberia had ever been heard from. That
house had a great fascination for Jack, and no matter where we were
walking he generally managed to bring us past it: and it was there that
HOW "JIM" KEENE MADE $6,000,000
Story of His RernarÃable Life Amid the Booms and Bonanzas of the Comstock. and of Wall Street.
Special to the Sunday Call.
NEW YORK, March 16.â 1n the recent Wall street boom James R.
Keene recovered his old-time position as the most daring and successful
speculator on change. He was the only prominent trader who saw the ad
vance coming, and he has made between $5,000,000 and $6,000,000 in six
weeks, with more in prospect. .
But Keene has helped the public as well as himself. On December 6
last he came out with an interview in which he predicted a general and
sustained rise in values. In the three months since then the stocks and
securities handled in Wall street have advanced over $100,000,000. A large
part of this increase has gone to small investors all over the country, who
took Keene's advice and went in at the beginning of the advance.
Nobody except Keene could have done it. There are bigger operators
here and men whose names are more familiar, but not one who occupies
his unique position. For one thing he is the veteran, or one of the vet
erans, of- the street. He was here in the days of Jay Gould and the elder
Vanderbilt. He has seen the rise and fall of many fortunes, Including his
own. He has made millions, lost them and made others to replace them.
But the chief influence that led investors to accept his judgment as to the
course of prices was his reputation for absolute honesty. Everybody
knows that Jim Keene Is honest. If another man had come out with the
fame statements he would have been accused of trying to Influence the
market for the benefit of deals that he had on foot. When Keene said it
the people believed it.
Keene has vindicated his financial sagacity by accumulating two great
fortunes. .He has done battle with some of the masters of the "street"
and has not come off vanquished. He may not be so great a manager as
Flower or Pierpont Morgan, but he is the king of speculators. His honesty
was proved when he paid $2,000,000 for which he was not legally responsible.
He has been in many deals and has always acted on the square. He has
been "euchred," "sold out," ruined by men whom he trusted, and some
of whom he bad made, but Keene himself has never been accused of a
mean or dishonest act. â 
The James R. Kern-? of to-day is a man of medium height and compact
build. His gray beard, close-cropped to the chin, does not hide the firm
outlines of his jaw. His gray eyes are searching, kindly and bright. His
manner In transacting business Is abrupt and decisive. But he will stop
In the middle of the most important transaction to shake hands with an
eld friend or to give ear to a dependent acquaintance, and lie has many
of the latter. '
Keene's charities are characteristic of the man. During the recent
blizzard in New York he was sitting with two friends in the Waldorf-As
toria. "This Is the time," said Keene, "when the well-to-do ought to put
their hands into their pockets to relieve the poor. Tho people in this hotel
should give $10,000 toward it, and if .they don't. I will."
"I'll give $1000." said one of his companions.
"I'll do the same," said the other.
Keene walked to the telephone, called up the Mayor and told him that
$5000 was waiting to relieve the sufferings of the destitute poor. The only
stipulation was that it should reach them immediately.
It was a holiday, and the Mayor had to get hold of the Commissioner
of Charities before he could promise that the money would be applied Im
mediately. Meanwhile Keene .sent for the head of one of the principal
charitable organizations of the city and placed. In his hands $1..000â
from his own pocket and two from his two friends. The, only proviso at
tached to the gift was. "Get it to the needy to-day."
A little later the Mayor, having made his arrangements, called up Mr.
Keene and announced that his gift was accepted. Keene's response was,
"All right." and so gave $13.**Â©0 to a very practical charity instead of the
$5000 ho had at first Intended for the purpose.
Keene's rise 7 to fortune has been a remarkable and In some respects a
romantic one. He was born in London a little more than sixty years ago.
He came to America at the age of 17. For a few years he "lived in -the
South and studied law there. As soon as he was admitted to the bar, in
the late fifties, he joined the throng of young men drawn westward by the
California gold discoveries, and began his practice in San Francisco.
The young lawyer's practice related chiefly to mining claims. He be
came familiar with mining stocks and properties, and soon was more a
mining speculator than a lawyer. He made money in his ventures, but his
health was poor, and a physician advised him to take a long trip. So he
closed up his business affairs,, packed his effects and started for the At
lantic coast, to be absent a >ear.
Th&t was an important trip for Keene. It made him a rich man.
Some time before he had become possessed of some shares of a mining
stock that was selling at almost nothing. It was believed to be practi
cally worthless, but soon after Keene's departure It panned out wonder
full) rich. The stock went up like a rocket from one figure to three.
Keene was away; news traveled slowly In those days. He knew nothing
of his good fortune for a long time, but when he returned to San Fran
cisco he found that his few hundreds had grown to $200,000. Had he re
mained at home he would have sold out probably at the first advance,
netting perhaps one-tenth of what he actually realized. As he himself
says, it .was a lucky journey. ......
The former lawyer, having brains, confidence, sound judgment and
$200,000 at his command, was ready to attempt larger affairs. He became

"And I say," Jack chimed in, "who lives In this house?"
"How should I know, and why do you ask?" Sophie replied.
"Because," Jack went on, "we know a lot about lt â or Aunt Susan
does. Po you sympathize with the Nihilists?"
"Jack!" I interposed, while Sophie said, very low: "You should not ask
such questions in the streetâ don't you know the very cobblestones have
ears?"
Walking rapidly on we scon reached our hotel, which Sophie entered
with us. In our room she threw off her wraps, and, leaning back in her
chair, said, "Now tell me what you know about that house."
It was Jack who told the story, with sundry additions which I tried to
correct, while Sophie listened with a hard look on her face and in her eyes.
When Jack had finished she said:
"That house was once my home: more I cannot tell you now, but come
and see mother. She never makes calls, but will be glad to meet you; come
to-morrow night." , ,
She put on her wraps and was gone before we had recovered from our
surprise. The next night, just after dinner, a messenger came, saying he
was to conduct us to Mme. Scholaskie's rooms, which were on a side
street, in an apartment house which sheltered a hundred or more families,
and was in striking contrast to the house on the Nevsky. There was but
one servantâ a woman wrinkled and old. but straight as an arrow, with a
look in her eyes as if she were always on the alert. The Scholaskles
rooms were on the third floor, and surprised us with their handsome fur
nishings, from the golden-framed icon to the ivy-covered screen which
shut off on" end of the salon. Madame, too, was a surprise, as, with her
snow-white hair and faded velvet gown, which told of better days, she
came forward to greet us. That sne was a lady showed in her manner,
her language and her voice. The latter was much softer and sweeter than
Sophie's, which had Impressed us as rather masculine. We were scarcely
seated when Ursula, the servant, brought us cups of hot tea from the
samovar steaming on a Bide table. As I was drinking mine madame took
from her pocket a paper, and, holding it toward me, said. "You sent this
to me ten years ago." - _
I recognized it as the note I had written for the beggar, and answered
in the affirmative. For a moment the woman hesitated; then she said:

undertakings. vvy> vy .-,>?. â :â 
Those were days of great speculation in San Francisco. Mackay,
Flood. Fair and O'Brien were the leaders. Keene took his place with these
men, became one of the board and soon had a reputation for good luck and
sound judgment.
The boom and the rush of money for Investment had forced prices to a
very high point. Keene saw that the inflation could not last. When he
believed that the turn was close at hand he went short of the Comstock
securities, which had received more attention and had been forced higher
than any others. In taking this course he had Mackay, Flood, Fair and the
powerful Bank of California against him. For a time there was a lively
contest between these rival influences, then the market began to sag under
the influence of Keene's persistent sales and soon it was going down
with a rush. In the smash-up of values that ensued Keene realized three
millions from his short Interest in the Belcher, Crown Point and Ophir
mines. This coup made him famous nil over the country as the flrst man
who had successfully fought the Pacific Coast triumvirate before named.
Although Keene had been on the bear side of the market, he was not
then, or afterward, a destroyer of values. In this case he simply took ad
vantage of a condition of affairs that was certain to bring about the same
result. After the crash, when values were on a saner level, he did his ut
most to restore prosperity. The Bank of California had been dragged
down in the ruin, and Keene set to work to rehabilitate it. and put up a
million dollars, along with D. O. Mills and "Lucky" Baldwin, for the pur
pose. It was duo to the combined efforts of these men that the slump did
not extend further. ;â ".'." u-X-'VK'i
Keene continued his speculative career in California until. In 1577, his
fortune had grown to $4,000,000. Then he started for Europe to recuperate
his health again. By that time the unvarying success of his operations
had made his name known to financiers and speculators, though he had
confined his attention entirely to the Pacific Coast.
It was In 1877. in the course of his journey, that Keene flrst appeared
in Wall street. He came to. see, but he remained to conquer. The attrac
tion of the larger market, the opportunity for great undertakings, were
Irresistible. Keene transferred his interests to New York and at once be
came one of the prominent figures in Wall street.
One fact that, the California millionaire soon learned was that ho
could not run the Wall street market to suit himself as he had done In
San Francisco. When he threw out thousands of shares In an effort to
send the market down it sagged only a point or two. instead of taking a
big drop, as had been the case In his earlier field. But he soon adjusted
himself to his new surroundings. One of the first big deals that he went
Into was the Western Union pool, which Jay Gould was engineering. In
this they netted a million between them.
Six years had elapsed since the panic of IS7*!. Prices were at their low
est ebb. Keene. carefully studying the market and the conditions of the
country, as he has always done, was convinced that rock bottom had been
reached and that a great advance was coming. He -bought heavily, stak
ing the hulk of his fortune on his judgment in the matter. The rise in val
ues came and continued beyond the expectation of those who had predict
ed It. Keene added between eight and nine millions to his fortune.
Peoule looked at Keene in wonder. Here was a man who had made a
fortune of fourteen millions by speculation, who had cleared* nearly ten
millions in Wall street in three years. His fortune was without parallel
for the rapidity of its accumulation. He came to be looked upon as a sort
of financial wizard. It was said that he could not lose. Perhaps Keene
came to have a little of the same feeling.
After his great success Keene branched out in every direction. He lived
in the princely fashion agreeable to his nature. He gave away thousands
and gave advice to his friends, on which they made thousands. He was
fond of racing, so he bought a stable and became a leading figure In turf
affairs. At the same time he speculated in oil, wheat, stocks, anything.
It was in 15 6 ." that Keene. In vulgar parlance, bit off more than he
could chew. He tried to corner the wheat market, an attempt that has
been a fatal stumbling block to other able financiers. In this same year
his horse Foxhall won the Grand Prix in Paris. It was an honor that
Keene prized dearly, and when it came he was engaged in a struggle that
Involved practically his whole fortune. Under the stimulus of rising prices
the Western farmers rushed their wheat to market faster than Keene with
his millions could absorb it. Jay Gould had been watching Keene's course
with interest and saw the vulnerable spot. With Addison Cammack he
set out to bear the market on the Interests that Keene was concerned In.
At the "same time the newspapers began denouncing the corner and its
backers. Some of Keene's partners In the combine became timid and sold
out. The load was too heavy fcr the Californian to carry alone and he went
down under it. Over seven millions of his accumulations were swept away.
He tried desperately to recoup himself on what: remained, but could not do
ft. Men whom he had aided before were willing to profit by his downfall,
and in the language of the street, he was "sold out.'' He had the mortifi
cation of seeing the shares that he was unable to hold on to advance over
50 per cent within a few months under the skillful manipulation of Gould
and his associates. . â¢*.
Keene was not overwhelmed by his misfortune. He set to work quietly
to regain what he had lost. For a time he was heard of but little. He
was In Wall street, and was making progress, but he did not attempt any
Napoleonic maneuvers.. Still he made money at a rate that could not be
accounted otherwise than rapid. He paid off all the obligations remaining
from his disastrous venture and gradually returned to something like his
eld rc-f'.Hnn in the affairs of t__s street .-â â â â â

favorite, and had done him good service. many times, but failed him at the
last. He was arrested and tried, and sent to Siberia, where he died within
two years. He had spent a great deal of money for the cause he believed
to be right; our house on the Nevsky was heavily mortgaged; we lost It
and came here. It is a special Providence" which has thrown you in my
way to thank you for your kindness to him. I try to be cheerful, but I
know we are living over a volcano which may engulf us at any time."
"But what harm can come to you. living here alone?" I asked; and
before she could reply Sophie said, fiercely:
"None whatever; she is nervous, and has been so ever since they took
my father away. It has a different effect on me; it makesâ meâ But why
talk about it? Po you all play cards?"
She turned to Lucy, who. knowing the Russian habit, answered:
"Yes â but not for money, as you do."
"I knowâ you play for fun; then let lt be fun. Ursula, bring the table."
Jack would not play, and I took his place, with madame for my part
ner, while Lucy played with Sophie. We had played one hand, and Sophie
was dealing for the second when Ursula came in. and closing the door
said, in a whisper, "There "Is an officer here asking to see madame."
For an instant madame's face was like a corpse, and there was a look
of terror In her eyes as she glanced toward her daughter. Sophie was per
fectly calm, and kept on dealing as she said, loud enough to be heard out
side If one were listening, "Show him in."
He came in, and, bowing politely, said to madame: "I did not know
you had company, but my business admits of no delay. I am here to ar
rest your son, Ivan Scholaskle, as head and front of a plot we have been
unearthing for some time."
Again that corpselike pallor spread over madame's face, as she re
plied: "When my son last wrote me he was in Paris; you will have to
seek him there." J*.
"He might have been in Paris when he last wrote you, but at 12 o'clock
last night he was seen to enter this house. It is my duty to search for
him. although, I assure you, I am sorry to give you trouble," the gendarme
replied.
I was horrified to find myself mixed up in a second affair of gendarme
rie and nihilism, while Jack and Lucy looked anxiously at me. Sophie
alone was calm; she turned up the ace of spades, and was adjusting
her cards as if nothing unusual was happening.
"Let him search," she said to her mother; "but as I have a good hand
and want to play it. there's no reason why we should not go on with our
game, unless you wish to look under the table flrst." -.
This to the gendarme, as she swept aside the folds of her dress, disclos
ing nothing worse than four pairs of feet huddled together in a small
space, for the table was not a large one.
The gendarme smiled and said: "I do not think he is under the table,
and I have no special wish to arrest him, except as I must obey orders.
Your servant, perhaps, will take me through the rooms?"
"Certainly." Sophie said. "Ursula, show this man wherever there Is a
chance for one to be hiding. It's your lead. I believe. Spades are
trumps," she added, turning to me, who was shaking so I could scarcely
hold my cards.
"By George! Jack cried, when the officer had gone and the matter was
explained to him. "I shall get mixed up in a Nihilist scrape, after all, and
that is what I wanted." .?-.^ > â¢
"Would you like to be one of the chief actors?" Sophie asked, and
Jack replied: "No. sir; and I wonder you could keep so cool with that
man hunting for your brother."
"I knew he would not find him, she said, and tried to smile; but it
was forced, as were all her actions after that.
' Lucy said nothing. She was very pale, and so absent-minded that she
at last threw down her cards, saying she was tired and wanted to go
home. As she stood in the dressing room Sophie stooped over her and
"May 1 kiss you once as a dear little girl from over the sea, where I
wish to heaven I had been born?"
Lucy hesitated a moment, then lifted her face for the kisses Sophie
crave herâ passionate kisses, such as women seldom give to each other.

complimentary things of the Russian Government, and that the officers
had called him a silly boy to fall in love with a man! Whereupon he had

Lucy was silent. Indeed, she had talked but little since the arrest, and
I was told that when questioned by the police she had pleaded. for Sophie,
asking that her punishment might be of tbe mildest. She was not taunted
with being in love as Jack had been, but was treated with a deference
and kindness one hardly expected from those grim Russians.
We had been home more than a year when there came a letter from
Ivan who was ln Southern Siberia, and his mother was with him. He was
happier he wrote, than he had been since he had sworn to avenge his
father' death The fever of excitement and dread of detection were over;
he had met his fate, and lt was not as bad as he had feared. Southern
Siberia was not like the dreary north. He was an exile. it was true, and
unden surveillance, but he scarcely felt it, as he had nothing to conceal,
and since his mother had joined him. he was tolerably content. He had
heard of Jack's daring defense and Lucy's eloquent pleading for him, and
thanked them for ft. . _._.., _

There is not very much to the station
located above the clouds, but what there
is Is of the best quality and most ap
proved pattern. High on the apex of the
peak is the wind vane. The top of this Is
over half a mile above sea level, where
the wind has an uninterrupted sweep
from all directions. Two hundred feet by

proper, which consists "of a pretty- shingle
building for offices, etc, and an outdoor
shelter for Instruments. With these three
points well looked after and directly con
nected by wire with the offices in the
Mills building, th.* service la a. most per
fect one, and Official Hammon thinks it
the most valuable addition ever made to
the weather service.
The station on tin top of Mount Tamai
pais is in charge of Officer Reed, who has
a great deal to do In keeping track of
the various instruments and reporting
their behavior to headquarters.
- The most arduous work of all is mak
ing the regular examination of the wind
vane on th peak. in stormy weather
this Is somewhat dangerous, as the Iron
support has to be climbed for about
thirty feet, and a slip of the hand or foot
would mean a serious if not fatal fall
to the rocks below. When tin* work has
to be done in a snow storm it becomes
doubly dangerous, as the iron steps on
the column become slippery with ice. . .
Keeping track of the other Instruments
is not unpleasant, but It requires a good
memory and Bound judgment to be sure
of just what they are doing. Official Ham

STRANGE DREAMS
That Came True.
NOBODY* will accuse Mr. . Melton
Trior, the well-known war corre
spond* : ' of the illustrated London
News, of being an unpractical vis
ionary, yet it la apparently owing
to a dream that his active pencil still
plies. When on board the German, going
out to the Zulu war, he twice dreamed of
an experience which did not strike him
cheerfully; he saw himself shot dead and
attended his own funeral. Naturally this
dream, being repeated, made some im
pression, and when, soon after arriving
at Durban, the artist received a letter
from his mother, relating a precisely sim
ilar dream which had come to her and
begging him not to go to Etchowe, he
paused to consider th. matter.

me in a burst of confidence that he "had
eaten many white men, but never a white

had not Included at least one in his bill
of. fare before swearing off on that kind
of food. The last Prince of Wallangra
also became very friendly with me and
told me many stories of his people and
himself, gallantly declaring that, had I
come to his land before his glory had de
parted, he would have made me his
Queen.
In Samoa I was the guest of a London
mission, and had a most delightful visit.
I found the natives most, gentle, kindly
and courteous, and can believe nothing
of the tales told of their ferocity and
cruelty. Princess Fa'amu, a daughter of
ties I have been present at and witnessed
and sketched, such an idea as 'keeping
out of It' never occurred to me." On this
occasion, however, the Idea seems to have
occurred pretty vividly; so much so that
personal- and fcnaternal warnings won the
day and the artist engaged a substitute,
an efficient amateur, who was willing to
take sketches, on the spot and send them
down to, Melton Prior to be retouched.
Whether the substitute was aware that
he was taking the place of a man doomed
by vision and laughed at the risk we are
not told. Anyhow, the war artist made
no secret of the contract, but wrote to the
proprietors of his paper, to whom he com
municated all the details. Mr. (now
Sir) William Ingram answered by cable:
"Regret your not going Into battle at
Etchowe. ," Perhaps our special artist is
preserved for better things to come."
The cablegram sounds sarcastic, hut the
conclusion "to the story Is tragically sug
gestive:
"The man who went up for me was one
of the first killed in the fighting!"
Now the question arises: What had this
poor substitute done that he should not
also be warned in a dream?
A later story comes with all the fresh
ness of novelty as showing that the dead
may hold converse with the living in very
unusual fashion. We know all about the
family ghost who frightens his descend
ants out of their lives at unseemly hours
with no apparent object. But we are not
familiar with the artistic ghost who takes
his proteges in hand and regulates their
proceedings on the platform. Yet one of

There Is not the/slightest doubt that
Mme. Thebes, the celebrated astrologlst,
and Mile. Couedon, the no less celebrat
ed vovante of the Rue Paradls,- foretold
the death of Felix Faure during the pres
ent year. The prediction of Mme. Thebes
was' published in the Oaulois on New
New Year's day. That of Mile. Couedon,
which has "been several times, repeated,
was first given "to the world more than a
year ago. Both these present day seers
agree in insisting on the bloody agitations
through which France must pass.
"Yes. it Is true that I foretold the death
of Felix Faure," said Mme. Thebes yes
terday In a short but very sensational in
terview. "Bui do not forget that I also
announced deaths by assassinations. The
astral influences of the year are deplor
able. It will not pass without great and
terrible events."
More than this the general public will
not learn from Mme. Thebes, the high
priestess of aristocratic horoscopes, the
lust paid prophetess of modern times.
The warnings of Mile. Couedon, on the
contrary, are given to the public unre
servedly, and their character is so re
markable that the greatest skeptics are
astonished at them. The uncertainty of
the French future in view of the pres
ent troubles has prepared the minds of
many to be Influenced by these two
strange women. It is remembered that
th. old-time prophecies of Nostradamus.
Orval and the Christian Kabbalists agree
with their forebodings of the century's
end.
"Perhaps." they say, "there may be

If the test of prophecy is that the thing
should happen, both Orval and Nostrada

vogue In France, la attributed to Philip
Olivarius, a Cistercian monk, whose man
uscript la said to have been dated 1541.
The monk never hesitated to give dates.
In truth, dates gave -the greatest eclat
to his nam.-, as they did, in a less de
gree, to that of Nostradamus. Through
out the centuries his dates ' have struck
home with remarkable exactness. The
Cistercian monk .has but one fault, ac
cording to the needs of modern times.
He is clear and definite In his allusions
to God, Popes and Kings; but he seems
to have had a presentiment of the action
of the masses only in a confused and agi
tated way. bo that his vision becomes the
more obscure the more people them
selves force their way. About 1848 the
accuracy with which he had foreseen the
rise and fall of Louis Philippe was made
matter of general admiration in the
Paris papers. Orval had set â¢ down the
events for 1850, as be always dealt in de
cades, no.t in odd years.
"The cock shall blot out the white
flower," the old Latin text reads. "The
man shall call himself king of the peo
ple. There shall be great commotion
among the nations, because the crown
shall be placed in the hands of the work
ingmen who have waged war in the great
cities."
Nothing could be more exact than this
prediction of the fall of the Bourbon lilies,
the rise of the citizen King, who was not
called "King of France," but "Roi dcs
King Mallet and the only native I met
who dressed in European costume, grew
very fond of me and we were much to
gether. It was laughable, however, to
see her sit down flat on the ground In all
her finery and drag off her shoes and
stockings when we were alone together.
In order, as she said, "to have a little
comfort now and then." ' **
In conclusion let me say that. If I
thought on the 14th of July, 1802, that I
was attempting something rather heroic
I have long ago found out my mistake.
I have found it all so easy; all has gone
so smoothly, and people everywhere have,
been so kind, that I have not once been
in a position where more than ordinary
courage and strength of will was nec
essary. *
lic only the other day and in that most
unromantic quarter, the busy, bustling
city of Liverpool, England. Miss Regina
de Sales is an American singer who is
rapidly acquiring European distinction
and who not long since returned to Eng
land from a successful- tour in Germany.
Apparently while there she had become
strongly Imbued with the spirit of Handel
and the grateful musician was determined
to reward her In the most appropriate
way.
The "Messiah" "was in progress. Miss de
Sales was singing the principal part, arid
the audience was enthustlcally apprecia
tive. The conductor alone was not satis
fled. Again and again he gave the Ameri
can singer the beat, only to find himself
absolutely ignored: she grew intensely ex
cited, forcing the time here, retarding it
there, following her own sweet fancy as
though she had never heard of conductors
and batons. . _
In the greenroom the inevitable storm
broke. "Why. did you not follow my
beat?" cried the incensed leader. â¢
"Why, Indeed?" cried . Miss de Sales.

seriously; the conductor laughed good

he supposed.

"The reign of evil men shall increase,
continues the text, "but let them hasten.
The thoughts of the Gaulish Celt will
clash together."
They have been clashing ever since.
Orval put the Franco-Prussian war
down for 1870. "Woe to you, great city."
he said, speaking to France. "Behold the
kings armed by the Lord! Already the
flre brings you to the earth. Yet the just
shall not perish. God has listened to
them. The place of crime Is purified by

Fourteen times six and six times thir
teen moons makes seventy-eight moons,
or fourteen years. This brings us to 1887.
and the rise of Boulangism, French col
onial expansion, anarchy and anti-Sem
itism, the seeds of all the present trou
bles.
This Is tho last clear vision of PhfllP
Olivarius, the Cistercian monk. The light
begins to blind his eyes. Quite out of his
ordinary habit, he sets down a terrible
event for an odd year, 1886. "In the year
1896 Paris will disappear, to reappear no
more. There will be much evil and no
good " For the events to follow, the text,
almost finished, is composed of obscure
phrases, each of which would need pro
found study, as his latest commentator,
In 1839, admits naively. As a conclusion,
the monk evidently fears for this fin de
Blecle a new cataclysm like that which
was, erroneously, foretold for the year
1000. His prophecy ends with 1899. Let
everything become separate. The century
of the end has begun. God fights for his
two just ones, but the man of evil pre
vails. But it is done. The high God
erects a wall of fire which dazzles my un
derstanding, and I see no more.
In occult circles it is well known whom
the evil man is. He is Antemos. alive to
day, 44 years old. and already directing.
from his secret place, those forces which
shall upset the world a few years hence.
As will be seen, the venerable 01 **" 2 ";
who wrote In 1-68, is perfectly clear about
him. The antichrist of Cnristlan .rev ela
tion, every interpreter of St. John has
fixed his date, approximately, at the end
of the nineteenth or the beginning of the
twentieth century. Nostradamus, an as
trologer pure and simple, with no claim to
supernatural vision, had a glimpse of him.
The predictions of this Frenchman,
Michael Nostradamus, who wrote some
where about 1570, are so well known and
so accessible in libraries that his triumphs
over his own future in our past need no
recital. Essentially French, he dealt
largely with the fate of his own country.
Two hundred years before the Frencn
revolution he told that great upheaval to
the very date. For 1792 he wrote:
"Beginning in this year there will be
the greatest persecution of the Christian
church. Nobles and Bishops shall be de
â  stroyed The fair land of France shaU
be desolated by flre and sword. These
unhappinesses will cause a renewal of the
world, which is to last a hundred years.
At the expiration of this hundred years
the troubles are to recommence, "The
land will be torn apart. Brother sha I
strive against brother. A great and evil
genius rises, who shall contend with the
stars themselves."
The occultists of Paris have what they
consider a perfect answer to the objec
tion of vagueness In the ancient prophets
and astrologlsts. They say, first, that
the predictions are not vague because the
dates are given. The old seers beheld
the future in broad lines. If you want
prophecies with clearer details, dealing
more minutely with the present times,
you have but to consult the utterances of
Mile. Couedon. Every one will remember
the first excitement over the voyante of
tho Rue Paradls in 1896, when she was
consulted by personages as diverse as
Charcot. Zola, Felix Faure and the Arch
bishop of Paris. Being chosen, according
to her firm conviction, to warn her con
temporaries of great events prepared for
flte near future, she has never ceased to
prophesy. Her foretelling of the fire of
the charity bazaar ls admittedly Inexpli
cable on rational grounds; while her pre
diction of the death of Felix Faure and
the voting of the retroactive law which
is to remove the Dreyfus case from the
Jurisdiction of the Criminal Chamber are
circumstantial enough to satisfy the moat
exacting, y...
It was in May, 1896, during a visit of the
Comtesse de Maille and several other
fashionable ladles, that Mile Couedon fell
into a trance and repeated the following
verses:
"Near to the Champa Elysees,
I see a place that Is not high.
That is not for piety,
But approached for charityâ
X Which is not the verity....
I see the flre lift itself;
I hear the people screaming....
I see flesh grilled
And bodies calcinedâ
I see them by shovelfuls."
Interrogated by the ladies, she declared
that none of mem should perish in the
fire This turned out as true as the sinis
ter prediction itself, for in May, 1597-a
year later-on the date of the catastrophe
two of these ladies were traveling, while
the Comtesse de Maille made a miraculous
escape from the burning shed itself.
The prophecies of Mile. Couedon are
given to the world in doggerel verse of
such monotonous character that no vio
lence is done to It in a simple prose trans
lation Her rhymes almost " invariably
end in "c" or "er," the commonest French
termination, which may be compared to
"tag" in English. It Is as if a poet should
write: - Â . _
As I was walking
I heard some one talking.
Her first Intimation of the taking off of
Felix Faure . and the terrible tragedies
that are to follow was published In May,
1898, when she said: "France will be chas
tised. Paris will ,be the city the most
tried. Epidemics and catastrophes of all
sorts will desolate the country at the end
of the year. The war will break out. I
see people massacred and the Seine red
with blood. At this, moment Felix^Faure
will have been put down. Nations will be
dismembered." All these chastisements
But that night Miss Edith Martin, the
harpist, sleeping beside Miss de Sales, was
wakened by a loud cry of "Bravo!" Sit
ting up suddenly in alarm she caught her
breath and trembled, for there, standing
gravely at the foot of the bed. was Handel
ln person, wig, frills and etceteras all
complete, vigorously conducting with the
roll of music in his hand.
The frightened girl turned round to
rouse her companion when 10. shock the
second came. Miss de Sales was likewise
sitting up, but with no manner of fear
upon her. In fact - she was still fast
asleep. But her hands moved, her throat
quivered,' her lips worked, her mouth
formed the correct singing oval; in short
she was evidently rehearsing, in soundless
fashion, a slnglhg part. This uncanny pro
ceeding lasted some time, till at last the
gentleman of the wig took j his departure,
the singer lay down calmly, as though
nothing had' happened, and Miss Martin
bided the dawn with as much nerv#Â» as
she could muster. * -.TV:
She said nothing at first: probably she
was afraid of being laughed at; the aver
age listener eyes rather superciliously the
young woman. who owns to. extraordinary
night visions while wide awake. But at
breakfast Miss Martin heard Miss de
Sales recounting some experience with
considerable animation; she -listened, and
behold, the singer was telling of the won
derful dream she had had when Handel
came to the foot. of her bed and carefully
put her through her part for that day.
Then Miss Martin considered herself free
to speak as an independent and greatly
scared witness. A R. ROSE-SOL.EY.
are to have no other end than to prepare
for the return of royalty. The successor
of Felix Faure will not remain long In
offlce. Civil war will intervene. Then a
man whom the people will take for the
savior of France will impose himself upon
the people. But he, too, shall pass. Can
lt be Antemos? Most believers think that
one of the Napoleons is indicated.
In July, 1898, Mile. Couedon again re
ferred to the successor of Felix Faure* and
foretold with exactness the voting of the
ex-post facto law. Mt is to be noted that
the lawâ which has not yet passed the
Senateâ mentioned after the succession
of the Presidency and not before it. "One
will succeed to him that you see. But he
will only pass. Then a law will be voted,
and you shall be terrified." Revolution ls
in the air: "I see them revolting. Peo
ple's minds are mixed up. I see knives
lifted." It is. however, at the end of this
remarkable prophecy that she sees most
unmistakably the death of the late Presi
dent. "For him we should pray. He can
not remain. He cannot remain. He can
not remain. His life is to efface itself.
God has, as it were, removed him for a
utility. All is premeditated by the Divin
ity."
To the occultists of Paris it is not strange
or contradictory that modern and ancient
astrologers like Mme. Thebes and Michael
Nostradamus should be in agreement with
modern and ancient prophets speaking in
the name of religion, like Mile. Couedon
and the Cistercian Olivarius. These cho
sen ones may be compared, they say, to
bits of stained glass, misshapen and per
haps soiled, through which the light
struggles, variously colored and perhaps
deflected; but It is still the light. Pore
Necton, who died In 1772. said: "Paris
shall be entirely destroyed." Sister Ma
rianne, of the Ursullnes of Blois, who
died in ISO 4, prophesied the same thing.
A certain Trappist of Notre Dame dcs
Gardes, in 1815, saw the capital burning.
The Seer of Bellcy, who died in 1820. said:
"Babylon is reduced to cinders. Unhap
plness to you, accursed city." The Abbe
Souffrant, who died In IX2S, also pro
claimed: "The great Babylon shall be
overthrown. Paris shall be destroyed."
The sheperdess-prophetess, Marianne Gal
tler, said: "The great prostitute shall be
destroyed by fire, but God will warn the
Just of Paris." And in our own day has
not Marie Martel foretold that "Paris
shall be burned, but Montmartre shall be
preserved"?

These Are San Francisco Firemen Who Have Received the Scannell for Bravery.
Â«, i i
THB-ScaimeU^ medal does more'than
reward once a year some heroic
member of the San Francisco Flre
Department. It recalls the fact
that the heroes are not all registered
in the records of grim war. It
brings into clearer view heroes of the life
about us, and in so doing raises up ex
amples of human nobilty and helps one's
faith in human nature.
So it was not all for Messrs. Shaugh
nessy, Cumisky and Sayers that nearly
the whole Fire Department marched
down Market street on Washington's
birthday escorted by a big battalion of
police and a brass band, and helped All
Metropolitan Hall to the doors, while
they and the Fire Commissioners and
other big men heard words of praise and
saw the Mayor of the City and the
president of the Merchants' Association
pin heavy gold badges of honor "for he
roism" on. the breasts of three blue
coats. It was good for every man and
woman there to see and hear the tribute
to brave deeds paid amid flowers, music
and oratory.
When old Dave Scannell died he left
$2000 to be invested with the provision
that the interest should be used to pur
chase annually a gold medal to be pre
sented to some member of the department
who had distinguished himself in the per
formance of his duty, particularly in sav
ing human life.
Five members of the Flre Department
have been thus decorated since the prac
tice began in 1896.
When at 3 a. m. of November 23 that
ever-dreaded fire alarm from box 47
brought fire apparatus from all parts of
the city to the Baldwin Hotel it was on
the Ellis street side that the most thrill
ing scenes were witnessed. District En
gineer Shaughnessy, who had come at a
.gallop from Stockton and Greenwich
â¢ streets, dashed up as the water tower
was getting Into action in Ellis street.
Chief Sullivan was directing its opera
tions.
"Shaughnessyl" said that district en
gineer to the busy chief by way of re
porting for orders.
"Go to Market street," was all the chief
said.
At that moment the fast-swelling
crowds of onlookers on the Ellis-street
side were thrilled by a sight far up above
them. A white-clad woman stood on the
broad cornice by the mansard roof above
the fifth floor. She was beside the fire
escape, but was apparently too bewil
dered to go down it. If she fainted or
loosed her hold she would fall to the
street below. Fire was above and near
about her, and flames were beginning to
leap out from the windows below. Help
must come soon or 'it would be too late.
The crowd watched and shuddered.
Shaughnessy was hurrying to his as
signed post and James Cumisky, nomi
nally tillerman of truck No. 6, but acting
as assistant to Engineer Wills, was pull
ing at hose lines in another part of the
street. They saw t.he soman's peril and
both instantly started for the fire es
cape. Neither had received an order, but
they hesitated not an instant.
Somebody had set up a long scenery* box
from the theater in standing position to
reach to the bottom of the iron ladder at
the first story. Cumisky, who had been a
sailor, caught up a long rope and with it
over his shoulder scrambled up the scen
ery box. Shaughm was at his heels.
At the bottom landing Cumisky gave his
fellow-fireman a hand, and then up they
went together, face to face, the sailor
fireman on the outside of the little iron
ladder and the boss of a district on the
inside. No fire was yet leaping out of the
windows next the flre escape.
At the fourth floor landing Shaughnessy
stopped for Cumisky to go up and let the
woman down by the rope to him, when
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1899.
he would carry her to the street.
"The ladder was getting pretty hot af
ter the fourth story and the fire was get
ting pretty close," said Cumisky, in tell
ing the story. "When I got up there she
was standing in the cornice, holding with
a death grip to the standpjpe. She was a
good-looking, tolerably large woman,
about 30, I guess. Her hair was all down,
her feet were bare and she had on only a
skirt over her nightdress. She was
screaming when I got up there, and did
not seem to realize where she was. One
foot was out over the cornice and if she'd
let go that grip she'd have fallen. Before
I reached her I expected to see her drop
any minute. When I took hold of her I
whipped a bowline knot around her and
then she fainted.
"The fire began to come out of the man
FIGHTING FOR A THRONE IN SAMOA.
A"nifi oti," killing knife, is the pride
and delight of the modern Samoan
warrior's heart. In olden days, be
fore the white man had brought in
struments of civilization into use,
he was satisfied with the heavy club,
which stunned an enemy; but now every
man fit for fighting considers himself un
armed unless he be the happy possessor
of a murderous looking butcher's knife,
with Its sharp point cut off. He wraps
the handle round with slnnett, so as to
insure a good grasp, and then woe betide
the fallen enemy whose head lies at his
mercy.
In times of peace the nifi ott Is in
daily use without unpleasant associations;
it is satisfactory when a pig requires dis
memberment or cocoanuts and bananas
need cutting down, but otherwise lt
comes mainly into play for mimic warfare
and warlike dance. You may Bee an of
ficial jester tossing it as he stands on the
sard story near us and it was getting hot
ter every minute. Oh, no; I wasn't scared
myself, because I knew whatever hap
pened I could slide down the rope In a
minute. I've seen ropes before. I gave
the rope a turn around an Iron, so I
could pay it out, and . then dropped her
gently down inside the ladder. Just then
the stream from the water tower struck
us and It seemed to revive her a little.
She couldn't do anything for herself, and
when I had dropped her to Shaughnessy
he packed her the rest of the way."
"I Just packed her down to the street
and left her, and then went around to
Market," said Shaughnessy, modestly.
"Do you know how to pack a person
down" a ladder? They just straddle the
back of your neck and you can hold their
legs tight in front of you and use your
bands in the ladder, too. I had her that
way, while Cumisky kept the rope taut
above. I Just left her in the street and
some people took her off to some drug
store, I believe."

and no harm ever results.
It is a different matter, however, when
the kirtled and smudged warrior capers

has taught him to use, but he has the
â /aguest taeas about taking aim. 11 it Da

and shriek of the victor he is down on the
fallen foe, the nifi oti comes into vigorous
action and a dripping human head is tri

That was how two medals were won.
Shaughnessy hurried on around to the post
he had been absent from for eight or ten
minutes in technical violation of orders,
and for long hours he and Assistant En
gineer Wills fought the flames from the
Baldwin annex. Cumisky came down the
heating ladder like a squirrel and went
to work about the water tower with little
further thought of the rescued.
It was but a few minutes Jater that the
crowd was thrilled again. Away up on
that same cornice, six stories above
ground, a man was running back and
forth, half hidden by the smoke and
quickly \o be reached by the eager
flames.
"Look! Look!" yelled the crowd.
Fred Savers, a fireman with Engine
Company No. 1, heard and looked up.
There were two fire escapes on the Ellis
umphantly held up in evidence of his
prowess.
Of late years missionary effort partially
abolished the barbarous custom and vic
tors were content with a victim's ear as
a badge of courage. The man who could
show the most ears was the hero of the
hour. This, however, did not altogether
commend itself to the Samoan mind, and
for reasons. It was discovered that brag
garts had a habit of slicing off both ears
thereby multiplying their feats unwar
rantably, and in this last war the ghast
ly heads have again been displayed.
The heads are invariably male. Hith
erto the Samoan woman has borne a
charmed life. She has been allowed free
access to opposing camps, has carried pro
visions, waterâ occasionally useful
Informationâ to her belligerent relatives,
and no finger has been raised to harm
Her. A Tight has even been temporarily
stopped because a woman was seen cross
ing between the lines, and If a fatality
occurred it was caused by the similarity
of dress and headgear which made It ior"
possible to detect sex at a distance
street side, but the excited man away Up
there amid the smoke did not see them.
"I'll get him down," said -Sayers, and
he made a dash for the same fire escape
that had presented the spectacular feat
of a few minutes before.
A. J. Christie, a Milwaukee traveling
man, in an outside room on the mansard
story, had been awakened by the break
ing of his transom and the shooting in of
flames. Pulling on a pair of trousers,
which he did not stop to fasten, he rushed
to the window and sprang out upon the
broad cornice. Smoke arid fire seemed
ail about him. He ran along the cornice,
but missed the iron ladders and could see
no possibility of .escape. Deciding quick
ly that he would not be burned alive, he
hurried back to â¢ his room, secured a
razor and was out on' the cornice again,
ready at the last moment to cut his own
throat.
With this resolution he stood there,
razor in hand, giving a last thought to
the wife and children he had. left 2000
miles away, when he realized a loud,
calm voice calling to him.
'Here, throw that away," it said. "Now
keep cool. I'll get you down." It was
Fireman Bayers speaking from out of
the smoke, twenty feet below.
"Keep your head and you'll be all
right," repeated Sayers in a matter-of
fact way as be came up. "Fix up your
suspenders there. Now, can you climb?"
"Yes."
"Well, as I go down you drop your legs
over my shoulders, and I'll help you
down."
With this burden on his shoulders the
strong young fireman went quickly down
ward through the smoke, past windows
where great tongues of flame from within
and the stream from the water-tower
were alternately striking and countering.
Safe on the ground at last and relieved of
his human burden he. too, went coolly and
quietly back to his hose lines.
The first Scannell medal went to As
slstant Engineer Wills for heroism at the
collapse of the Brighton lodging house at
22 Fifth street on June 22, 1896. An exca
vation next the four-story building under
mined its foundations and the whole
building fell in a tangled mass of debris,
burying a score of people. Many were
quickly rescued by willing hands. "Wills
made two especially perilous trips far Into
the mass of still creaking and falling tim
bers, safely dragging out Miss Bessie
Wilson and taking out also Mrs. Ernestine
Silversteln, who soon died.
District Engineer Dolan distinguished
himself in April, 1897, at a fire on Bu
chanan street, near Ellis, at which he was
in charge. A narrow passage beside a no
tion store led to the coal yard and stable
of John H. Rulffs, in the rear. Several
cans of oil in the rear of the store
quickly set store and stable afire.
Rulffs and a young man he employed ram
to the stable to save three horses, but the
blazing oil cut off their retreat and
quickly surrounded them by fire. Tho
young man escaped through the stable
roof, but the older man was overpowered
by the smoke and fumes.
Dolan, working in the passageway,
thought he heard* groans. The little coal
yard was getting to be a veritable fur
nace, but into it Dolan sprang. Past
the nearest flames, he groped around in
the dense smoke. Then the stream
struck him and bowled him over, knock
ing him against the insensible form of
Rulffs. The burden was a heavy one,
and Dolan was half overcome. He called
for assistance. Foreman William Ken
nealy heard him and came. In a mo
ment they together dragged out the old
man to safety. He could have lived in
that fiery atmosphere but little longer.
That is the sort of stuff the San Fran
cisco Fire Department is made of. They
are proud of their big gold medals, but
to them their deeds were merely part cf
a fireman's duty.'(fpP| PAGES hJ^

ality may not affect the audience of an
other clime. Yet this is true only in a
slight degree. On the surface the child
of the blue sunny skies is very different
from the child of the northern star. And
what touches one on the surface does
not move the other. But- after all they
are brothers with | the same elemental
feelings, and if you strike deep down in
their hearts you find the same chord vi
brating. .
Whether an audience is moved and
knows technically, the wherefore or
whether it simply feels without asking
the why matters not.
American audiences feel. Who shall say
otherwise? Not one who has looked out
Upon that sea of mobile listening faces.
Not one who has seen- them sway with
a common impulse toward the singer.
"Not one who has, felt their magnetism,
their responsiveness, their sympathy.
Not one who through the glare has
watched eyes soft with unshed tears or
brimming over with laughter.
When an audience gives an artist this
she can ask nothing more. The American
audience does give it. The soul of the
singer and the soul of the audience clasp
hands across the footlights in America
â¢just as tenderly and earnestly as In any
other spot on the globe. :-. .
If you asked me whether the American
people as a whole are as musical as other
Nationalities, that would be quite another
matter. those who frequent the
Sera those who make up the American
Sonce, differ very little from other au
diences. It is not alone the crowded
Souse but there is the same enthusiasm
to Inspire the artist. vy
It would.be almost impossible for me
to nlac-* any one American city above an
other as far as musically Intelligent audi
ences are concerned.
Teor as I said before, audiences are
ve^ much the same the wide world
round. ,7 #

QADSKI: The striking dif
ference in American and
European audiences is
that the ladies here take
more interest and are so
much more' appreciative
than the men. 1 think in
every branch of art m
America it is the same
the ladies lead.
-. n OUR years ago I first came to
Ig? America. When I returned to
F=* Germany I had a neat little stock
{ of opinions concerning ' America
& which I carefully brought with me
TmTrU cC has d chLg/rso'much that in
a^ance fj-ft"^
"T.n ill Sing. , my views to suit
cfrcumstanfes, .0 this last time
I was prepared : for the long musical
stride which America had taken in so
short a space of time.
American audiences progress as rapidly
musically as does America commercially.
Each time that I have sung here I find
that the faults of the previous year have*
either become less noticeable or are en
tirely mended.
Four years ago, on my first visit, I was
charmed. Each succeeding season showed
such a marked improvement that now I
am doubly charmed with America. This
may not be good arithmetic, but it has
the saving quality of truth.
America progresses so rapidly that
what we say of her to-day will to-mor
row no longer hold good. It is a won
derful soil on which to transplant tho
European arts. Fifty years hence Amer
ica will have advanced musically beyond
recognition. Time has proven that tho
danger lies not in .predicting too much
but in predicting too little for America.
The striking difference in American and
European audiences Is â¢ that the ladies
here take more interest and are so much
more appreciative than the men. I think
in every branch of art in America it Is the
,same the ladies lead.
But this is perfectly natural growth.
First comes the business of a nation, then
the art. American men have been too
busy with affairs of State to cultivate art.
While the men have been devoting them
selves to business, the ladies have had
an opportunity to study the artistic.
As I said before, America moves so
rapidly up the scale that It is hard to
place her musically with other nations.
But. l think T may Say that the two most
musical American cities in which I have
sung are Boston and Philadelphia. They
are typical American cities, and it Is only
such that I am considering when I make
this assertion. New York Is too cosmo
politan to serve as a model of American
audiences. People from every clime and
of every nationality go to make up its
audiences.
I never received a more delightful trib
ute than in "Adia" last Thursday night.
No one could ask more of an audience,
that small In numbers, was so great In
appreciation. But of course I can not
place San Francisco musically from one
or two performances. Its musical In
telligence Is certainly of. a high order.
They tell me that San Francisco Is as
cosmopolitan as New York, so perhaps
it Â»' would not be fair after all to rank it
with typical American cities.
The time is coming when the American
man 'will 'take the- same interest in mu
sic- that the American woman-does. And
then the problem, of. why. America doe*
not give the world "a great composer will
be solved.

DE LUSS/\J. : This blend
ing of races has made of
the American audience a
thing like, yet unlike,
event other audience in the
iv Grid. There is the sure
footed applause of the for
eign element, which knows
whereof it applauds, and
the applause equally gen
uine but more timid from
those who are not to opera
houses born.
â â 3 HE American audience is very
much like the French audience.
If It thrills to your notes. there is
,i . the same genuine generous out
burst of enthusiasm.
An English audience may appreciate
the artist fully, but the Anglo-Saxon
coldness Is a constant checkrein on.en
thusiasm. They may love you as much
but they are not so demonstrative. They
make no outer show of appreciation, yet
the artist feels the silent bond of sympa
thy.
Since America is first cousin to England
one might expect very, much the same
from American audiences. But who are
cousins scarcely less removed? Italy,
France, Spain, Germany and a dozen
other countries have a right to claim dis
tant relationship. For from each and
every one of these places America has
added- to her population and to her cos
mopolitan aspect.
This blending of races has made of the
American audience a thing like, yet un
like, every other audience ln the world.
There is the sure-footed applause of the
foreign element which knows whereof it
applauds, and the applause equally gen
uine but more timid from those who are
not to opera-houses born.
For in Europe where every city has its
own opera-house the people go nightly
to the opera. The market woman hums
an air from the opera over her wares,
the urchins sing at their play and there
Is literally music in the air. The music
of the streets is from some opera that has
caught the popular ear.
And that the ears of the masses of such
countries should be attuned to good mu
sic Is natural. Likewise a country where
music is reserved for especial occasions
has not the 'musical capacity of a more
fortunate land. In Europe for a cent
one may hear a band beyond compare,
and for Httle more money drink In the
sweet sounds at the opera.
There is this great difference In the
massesâ the American urchin whistles
the latest coon songâ the French raga
muffin sings an air from the opera.
But the American people who do have
musical advantages, who do hear opera,
they make a charming audience before
which any artist Is glad to stand.
There Is no more Interesting audience
in the world than the American and
none more Inspiring. For almost every;
nationality is represented and the typi
cal American, with his keen understand
ing, rare responsiveness and willingness
to learn, gives to the assemblage a naive
touch not found elsewhere.
San Francisco Is Jno exception, and
whatever nationalities go to make up Its
audiences, the whole is certainly delight
ful for the artist to whose lot falls the
sweet pleasure of appearing before them.

GH/.LI/\ : Br ava for Amer
ica ! I say. For when you
consider her disadvan
tages and youth you can
not but marvel at the mu
sical intelligence of her
audiences. There is good
raw material in the Amer
ican audience that some
dayâ when good opera is
as much apart of the city
life as street sweeping
will develop into the high
est musical intelligence.
i}-.v> MERICAN audiences - are over
j .\\ indulgent. An artist is always In
/ \ danger of being spoiled by their
li . _â¢> good nature. An open expression
of disapproval is sometimes as necessary
for the careless- artist ' as Is a spank
ing for the spoiled child. In this coun
try If an artist does not feel well or is
lazy she need not take the -usual note and
tb â  audience will not complain. Abroad
such a proceeding would meet with mark
ed uibapproval."'
But 1 love the American audiences Just
the same, and I am glad to say that all
good-humored Indulgences In the â¢ world
could not make me less painstaking and
conscientious. .'â  .
Italy and Spain are the only two coun
tries abroad in which I have sung. I
have been on the stage but four years,
so I. have not yet had an opportunity to
sing for many nations. But I am sure
that to be weighed musically in the same
scale with Italy and Spain is a suffi
ciently severe test.
Brava for America! I say. For when
you consider her disadvantages and youth
you cannot but marvel at the musical
Intelligence of her audiences. They feel
intuitively what they lack In technical
knowledge. There is good raw material
in the American audience that some day
âwhen good opera Is as much a part of
the city life as street sweepingâ de
velop Into ". the 'highest musical intelli
gence. Â.'--.- r
The vital spark is thereâ without which
neither singer nor audience can. fill their
respective places. . For an audience, like
a singer, that is bubbling over with mag
netism can be forgiven much. And be
cause American audiences have this qual
ity they will some day have the techni
cal as well as the Intuitive appreciation.
That the American audiences are like
those In Milan or Madrid I cannot say.
Why, even the beggars go nightly to the
operas there, as have their fathers for
generations before them. Music is bred
in the bone and breathed in the air. It
is as much a part of their lives as eat
ing and drinking.
In San Francisco, more than in any
other American city in which I hay*;
sung, I am reminded of .the Latin aud
ences. Why, even on the streets I see
type constantly. And of course they
very sympathetic to me. - v ~
Oil the first night that 1 sang I saw on
the faces of my audience the same ex
pression that has inspired me in Milan
and . Madrid. That means more to me
than handclapping and shouts.
It Is really hard for me to say what the
American audience is for I keep think
ing of what they will be.
DE LUSSAN'S IDEA
of the
Character of Carmen
To begin you must know I * consider
Carmen a very fascinating person. True,
she was utterly devoid of any moral prin
ciple, for her passions were those of an
animal; but for all that, she was a wo
man, which extenuation monsieur must
admit covers a multitude of faults, or a?
ln Carmen's caseâ sins.
To my mind. Carmen's last love was al
ways hÂ«r strongest. It was If you choosa
the dominant force in her existence. She
was a woman at once thoroughly fasci
nating and wicked, and it was the latter
that made her the former. There was
absolutely nothing sweet about Carmen.
I believe she was capable of loving a
man sufficiently well to kill him. for a
study of the character shows her to have
been ruled by i.er passing passions. But
she was* not capable of fidelity er a last-
Ghalia,
ffi) 25t0 32 WB?'
Ing love. Fidelity was foreign to her na
ture.
I have studied Carmen long and seri
ously. Of course, I have been guided by
precedent, but I have striven also for
originality in my interpretation. The li
bretto gives Carmen as she was, and that
portions of it are of necessity omitted* is
sufficient proof as to the kind of woman
she was.
There is but one sad moment in bar
men's life, and that is when she is read
ing her cards. They tell her she must
die, and being Imbued with superstition
she Is depressed; but the entrance of the
Toreador banishes it in the twinkling of
an eye. â¢ These are some of the finer
phases of the character dwelt upon by
all artists. Their very suggestion tells
that portion of. the story which it is phys
ically and morally Impossible to portray.
How do I prepare for a performance of
Carmen? VÂ«'>
Very much as one does for any physi
cal contest. The performance is exhaust
ing to a great degree. The day of the
evening upon which I am to appear I
rest quietly and never speak. I receive
no visitors. A performance of Carmen
completely exhausts meâ lt is positively
killing. I have many changes to make,
and from the beginning I have to be all
life and fire. Carmen demands that an
artist be ever ready and attractive, ana
this can only be obtained by one's keep
ing in tKe^>_nk*Â«_- condition. . - -

the tracks of anxiety sufficiently. The

However, we are improving nightly, ana
by the time the season is over our opera
manners will be beyond criticism. They
were mostly sins of omissionâ neglecting
to cover up unsightly bones or hideous
rolls of fat. For "lovely woman en
masse in decollete Is not a thing of
beauty ' Pretty shoulders were displayed
and were. appreciated. But since the fiat
had gone forth that low-necked gowns
were In order, women uncovered shoul
ders that were not good to look upon.
And yet some one raised a hue and cry
because the entire feminine audience was
not decollete.
Heaven forbid! say I. For why con
vert the opera house Into a museum of
anatomy? 'Twere a sin to hide pretty
throats and dimpled shoulders-and like
wise 'tis a sin not to cover up those that
are hungry looking or cushiony.

It was just 8 o'clock when we sat down

QUEEN VICTORIA'S NEW $1,500,000 YACHT
UEEN VICTORIA'S new yacht ls almost completed. It
is pronounced by experts to be the finest vessel of its
class in the world. 77 -7:
I I The royal yacht Is now building at the dockyard
at Pembroke, herewith is presented the dockyard
at Pembroke, and herewith ls presented the first pic
ture as yet published in America of this very interest
ing vessel. No name for the yacht has 'been selected,
but It is understood that the vessel will be christened either
Enchantress or Balmoral. The yacht Is now so near comple
tion that May 9 has been set as the date of the launch, and
the christening ceremony will be performed, if present ar
rangements be carried out, by the Duchess of York. The first
keel was laid December 23, 1897, and It Is expected that the
yacht will be ready to go Into commission by the close of the
resent year.
According to some representations, the British admiralty
has sought to maintain a considerable degree of secrecy re
garding the plans for the boat, but there ls excellent reason for
doubting the authenticity of these reports. The new yacht is
420 feet over all' by 50 feet beam, and will have a draft of 18
feet on a displacement of 4600 tons. It will thus be seen that

A very pleasant birthday party was ten
dered to Miss Millie Sideman last Tues
day. Among those present were: The
she is of 1000 tons less burden than the Russian Imperial yacht
Standart, and 423 tons in excess of the German Emperor's
yacht Hohenzollern, which is not, however, strictly speaking,
"entitled to classification, with the other royal yachts. inasmuch
as she Is nothing less than an armored cruiser with apart
ments fitted up for the Emperor.
The yacht now building at Pembroke will be fitted up with
twin screws and will be the first of the British royal yachts to
be thus propelled. Boilers will be of the Belleville water tube
type in three groups. The hull Is to be of steel, sheathed
with wood and covered with copper. As will be seen from the
picture, the yacht will have three funnels and three masts.
Compared with the largest private yachts In the world
this new vessel will, of course, stand out in striking contrast.
The William K. Vanderbilt yacht Valiant, which is at the head
of the list of private yachts, is only 332 feet over all, 39 feet
beam, 16 feet draft and of 1823 gross tons. The Payne yacht,
now building at the Bath Iron Works. Bath, Me., and the J.
Plerpont Morgan yacht Corsair, under construction at the yard
of T. S. Marvel & Co.. Newburg, N. V., are 303 feet and 302
feet over all, respectively. It may also be noted that the Eng
lish yacht is expected to cost in the neighborhood of $1,500,000,
which is about twice the amount expended on any of the
large private yachts. . . >

AVERAGE WOMAN`S STRENGTH
IT Is an admitted fact that woman is
the weaker vesselâ always was and al
ways will be. This, no doubt, is be
cause man, on the whole, prefers in
woman grace and tenderness, while
she prefers in man strength and ac
tivity. There is, of course, no good rea
son why woman should equal man in
physical or mental strength. Yet it is
cf more than ordinary Interest to know
the why and the wherefore of and the
comparative difference in the strength of
"the two sexes.

It will be seen 'at a glance that the dif
ference is very marked. It is the pecu
liarity of these differentiations that are
more than Interesting. You will notice
that the hand flexors In men have just
twice the strength of the arm flexors,
while in women the hand flexors are near
ly three times as strong as those of the
arm. y *n â '-.
It is only in some few muscles, how
ever, that woman is, comparatively,
stronger than man. Altogether, man is
two and a half times stronger than
woman. The reason for the greater weak
ness in certain muscles in woman is very
manifest. Women engage less In the la
borious employments which call into play
all the muscles of the body.
That woman is stronger in the legs Is
due. no doubt, to their being of necessity
more used than any of the other muscles.
The legs of women being shorter than
in men accounts in part for the greater
strength of the thigh flexors.
The same rule will hold good for the
thigh abductors and adductors, -which are
relatively the strongest muscles possessed
by women, the muscles that are relatively
weakest in woman being in the arm.
Perhaps the most interesting point to
be traced out of the table given is that the
strength of the average woman, in com
parison with her weight, is less than two
thirds that of the average man, and the
strength of the average woman In com
parison with her height is only four-sev
enths that of the average man.
The total strength of the average wom
an, as compared with the total strength
of the average man, Is .53.
The same as to weight is .86.
The same as to height Is .92.
It Is Interesting to note that the
strength of each division of the body is
more than sufficient to lift the entire
body. Even the smallest total found
that for the chest in womanâ is able to
life one and one-quarter times the weight
of the body.
Thus the inferiority of woman to man
only in a mere matter of muscles and
strength, rememberâ has been conclusive
ly shown, < And so long as she remains
this frail, dependent creature, man will
rejoice to take l^r to his bosom to be the
dear partner of his joys and superior
strength.â Magazine.

"Let's," said the rounder.
"Well, I never did get that hat again.
i The ashman put it up for a drink and
the barkeeper _<__ld it for 25 cents to the
j bootblack and the bootblack traded it
for another hat that would fit him in a
second-hand store, and the proprietor
sold it to some unknown man. 'Now,
what do you think of that? I suppose
some tramp has it now, with two nice
twenties folded up in the band. Let's

"Let's," said the rounder.
"Of course, I had to tell my wife why
I was* so anxious to get that hat back
and she said it served me just right.
I was pretty humble then, and reg

" 'Sir!' she said, giving me a cold

"Well you could have â¢ knocked me
down with a feather. The girls laugh
ed, the rakish-looking young fellow
who had given his seat to my wife
moved up closer and -ive me an ugly
look, and the conductor rang the bell
to stop the car and put me off. If I had
had a grain of sense I would have got
off and preserved the secret of that

tions of opera gowns given else
where that even the most exact
! ing could demand. But here are
Â£-> a few generalities that can be re
duced from fashion as seen thus
far at the opera.
Black and white are the most effective
shades. Why? Because they stand out
well if cut decollete. If not. they are
taboo. For only when snowy throat and
shoulders rise out of billowy masses of
black or white are they pretty. if you
wear a high-necked gown choose a color,
but choose wisely and think twice.
.. : ; For a gown of brilliant hue may turn
-garish when next to a shade that does
'Hot' harmonize. Or a delicate shell-like
tint may fade into insignificance when
subjected to unkind contrast with a
neighboring hue.
Remember that colors are usually at
daggers' ends with each other and choose
a shade that Is capable of holding its own
against all comers. If we could select
for our next neighbor at the opera what
they shall wear, then we could give our
own color fancy full play. But unfor
tunately it is not until too late that we
flijd a pink gown next to our own pink,
each of which kills the other.
So If you go to the opera In decollete,
go In black or white varied by spangles
or what not. Â» If fate has not been kind
enough to permit of this sort of gown,
then work out your own salvation,
Choose a shade that can be depended
uponâ neither to deepen Into extravagant
gorishness nor pale to sickly hue.

is extinct, killed by its own unbecoming
ness. The skirts were trimmed with lace,
flowers or. ribbon: many of them, how
ever, having overskirts made entirely of
lace. The bodices are extremely simple,
fitting closely in graceful, soft folds.
Several gowns In princess effects were
worn, but evidently they are not as pop
ular here as elsewhere.
The popularity of spangled trimming
was evident. Nine gowns out of ten

gowns were worn during the week by

figure and splendid carriage lending an
additional charm.

Fringes have arrived, and women are
taking them into serious consideration in
ordering spring and summer gowns. The
revival is accompanied by a novelty. Ihe
novelty is that the new fringes look like
a new kind of silk lace. The threads are
king and loose and thickly crowded to
gether in the design. The soft crumpled
effect, however, is very telling, and will
trim most satisfactorily as well as
smartly. , _ â¢
JEWELED walking canes and wigs
are among the latest freaks of fash
lon to which English women are
giving themselves up. To see a
lady of fashion. walking in the est End
with a cane in her hand, according to a
London daily paper, is not a new sight,
but It seems to be a fashion which is be
coming a rather extravagant one, judg
ing from the richness of the cane heads,
some of which have been seen mcrusted
with jewels. The wearing of wigs Is also
creating a greater extravagance in head-
Coiffures are becoming more elaborate
and are lending themselves to greater
adornment with jewels and richly deco
rated combs. It is a craze for wavy hair
heedless of the effects of the use of hot
tongs, which has caused such a havoc
among women's hair that hair dressers
have been forced to create wigs for their
lady customers, ladies taking very kindly
to the new idea, for much time is saved.
They can delight in all the picturesque
effects of an elaborate headdress without
sitting for hours under the hands of the
hairdresser, for wigs, dressed on blocks,
are afterward placed on their heads.

Flowers are high in favor, set in great
bunches with their foliage on one side of
the toque, and as the spring advances we
shall see more and more of the flower

which in France go by the name of Nice
hats, will again appeal to an almost cer
tain favor, for they are most becoming.
Some of the new hats are very coquettish

T'S a fortunate thing that these are
the days of comparative Idleness, for
what with keeping one's nose proper
ly powdered and one's hair In .curl
ii there hasn't been much time for any
thing else. The moist weather of the
past week has straightened out the most
beautifully curled tresses with a persist
ency that was positively heartrending.
But don't you care, girls! Think of the
crops and the "bodful" Easter bonnets
that lt will probably mean to you.
Speaking of Easter bonnets reminds me.
Now is the time of all the year when you
should coddle your complexions. Unless
you see to It that the skin Is well nour
ished, carefully powdered and shielded
from the March breezes by a serviceable
chiffon veil, you will find the gorgeous
beauty of that Easter head adornment
most horribly embarrassed by a red lit
tle nose and weather-beaten cheeks.
These March winds sometimes develop
Into a raging, roaring tempest that can
create havoc both dire and dreadful to a
delicate skin. , . . â7_,.;_
So look out for them and put Income
of your spare moments during this bless
ed Lenten time that are not devoted to
sewing bees or afternoon service to fluff
ing up some good cold creams and washes
for the complexion, so that you may be
able to Join in the Easter dress parade
with the happy consciousness that the
splendor of your toilet is not dimmed by
an utterly impossible complexion.
First of all you must have a good, pure
cold cream. If you do not happen to
have this already, here is a formula for
one that Is excellent, not only for soft
ening the skin, but for whitening it as

Mme. Holton wore a' figured grenadine
over a foundation skirt of gray silk.
The grenadine was in black and white
with apple green figures running through
it. The overskirt was trimmed at inter
vals with narrow ruffles of black and
white Chantilly lace, and a sash was
formed of the lace, which hung down in
two long ends over the train. The other
decoration was long clusters of green
chiffon roses hanging frojji their stems
in graceful bunches. The bodice was
trimmed in the same manner with chif
fon puffs running around it in serpen
tine effect. The neck was finished with
a bunch of green chiffon roses on one
shoulder. A turquoise blue velvet belt
and long mousquetalre sleeves with the
lace falling over completed this beautiful
gown.
Miss Gertie Mcc wore a Cyrano pink
mousseline princesse of a Renaissance
pattern. The skirt was a yoke skirt, the
lower part being formed of Cyrano chif
fon accordion pleated edged with rose
petals. The yoke part of the skirt was

fine sieve and then through bolting cloth.
Do the same thing with the oxide of zinc,
the magnesia and the boracic acid before
adding them to the rice powder. When
all are combined put twice through bolt

any particles that remain. Add the attar

â diet, bathing and exercise.

massage also, rubbing always across the
lines. Try witchhazel on the red spot on
nose. I can tell you of no cure for the
red veins. As they are out of sl^ht, 1

ing exercises and swinging Indian clubs,
will do more for the hollows ln the shoul

C. W.â the coarse pores ln your
case 1 should advise a nightly scrubbing
with a complexion brush and castile soap,
followed by massage with the orange

times a day, it will, I am sure, improve
their condition. The only way to reduce
the fleshy parts Is to massage, picking up
the flesh between the thumb and fingers

you can without bruising the flesh. The
simplest lotion for removing freckles is
made by dissolving fifteen grains of

ply to the face at night after washing.
Let it dry on the skin and then apply a

removing freckles permanently except by
keeping out of the sun and wind.

tial properties of the two waters are
about the same. So, If you prefer using

SWEET SWEETPEAâ the face Is
too red for comfort it can be remedied
by active pedestrlanlsm, a well-ventilated
bedroom, no tight bands or corsets and
a diet of ripe pears, oranges and figs.
Put the hands and feet ln hot mustard
water every night. Avoid hot drinks, eat
very slowly and be out In the open air
as much as possible. The exercise of
standing with the, heels close together,
bending over and trying to touch the floor
with the tips of the Angers, if repeated
a * number of times each morning, will
often prove -of wonderful benefit in re
ducing large hips. Try IV. Sage tea. If

process of shedding Itself, and ' wear that
switch ;as little as possible. Cannot you
discard lt entirely? Wearing . a switch'
heats the scalp and Is , really detrimental
to the growth of the hair. Let your hair
hang and give it a sun bath as often as
you can. And use this tonic: Four

NO. 4711, G.â Blonde hair should always
be washed with the yolk of an egg, as
: that will make It keep its golden tint*.
Mixing the egg with a pinch of borax
and a pint of warm water Is a good plan.
I should not advise you to use very much
alcohol on your hair. It is apt to make
it harsh and dry. *
ZAZAâ If the growth of hair on your
face Is too abundant to be removed by
the electric needle, why not try bleach
ing out the hairs with peroxide of hydro
gen. To three tablespoonfuls of the per
oxide add one teaspoonful of ammonia.
Apply twice a day the first week and
then not quite so frequently. The per
oxide will bleach the hairs and make
them less noticeable, and the ammonia
will finally deaden the little pests. If
this treatment is not efficacious, write to
me again and I will suggest something
else.

MISS D. PATIENCEâ Your complexion
Is not in a healthy condition or It would
not be so dry and peel off in that dis
tressing way. Better not use any soap
on your face for awhile, since it will only
help to remove the small quantity of oil
there is in the cuticle. In fact, until your
skin gets into better shape I would ad
vise you to use very little water on it.
Cleanse it thoroughly each night with
the orange flower skin food, formula for
which is given in foregoing reply to
Cytherea.' if this does not help you write
to me again.
DOTTIE D.-An occasional steaming of
the faceâ say once in two weeks â do
the skin no harm.- Full directions were
given for steaming in last Sunday's Beau
ty Talk. The alum wash is to be used
only when the skin is very flabby. . A
piece of alum the size of a bean in a pint
of water Is sufficient. Massage with the
orange flower skin food will plumpen the
face. Directions for massaging the little
wrinkles around the eyes will be found In

SCHEMES FOR MAKING MONEY
EVERY day some woman Is trying
some new avenue toward the ac
cumulation of a bank account, or at
least a little extra pin money.
A French woman, who has a most ar
tistic little home, found herself with more
time on her hands than she knew what to
do with. All of her friends admired the
artistic arrangement of her home, and
one day one of them asked If she would
object to, going over to the friend's home
and rearranging the furniture, for every
thing looked so stiff, altnough she had
plenty of pretty things.
Such a success was made by the young
French woman that she concluded It
would not be a bad idea to see what she
could do for strangers in this way and
make a little extra money. She adver
tised to do dusting and artistic arrange
ment "by the hour." She had several an
swers, and her customers were so pleased
that they recommended her to their
friends, until now she has all she can do.
Another young woman of refinement
does mending, reading, writing and shop
ping by the hour for an invalid, and finds
herself most genially employed. Persons
who do not care to employ a companion
constantly find this a pleasant plan. This
young woman finds she can serve three or
four customers every day and still have
her evenings at her disposal. She is free
to come and go. and the change of em
ployers she finds most Interesting.
Another young woman, thoroughly in
structed in the art of china painting,
finding that it had grown old fashioned,
discovered a new way in which to apply
her art. She makes a business of replac
ing broken pieces in fine sets of china. All
she needs is one of the other pieces, and
she can match it so that no one can tell
the difference between the fine Imported
china and the hand-painted copy unless
his attention Is especially called to It.
Still another young woman has found a
way to fill the slender purse without leav
ing her own home. She was left an or
phan, but with a houseful of furniture.
She managed to fill up the bedrooms with
"roomers." but still she found the rent a
burden. She had three large parlors run
ning the full extent of the house, with
archways and folding doors, so that the
first floor could be thrown together. These
were handsomely furnished, but she never
entertained, and she conceived the Idea of
allowing other people to entertain In her
parlors. .'â¢..' _
Her friends were told of her plan, and
they were only too glad to avail them
selves of the opportunity. She now has
to figure pretty closely to arrange for all
the card parties, club meetings, dancing
classes and afternoon teas which demand
the use of her pretty rooms. She has a
small dais ln the back parlor for the use
of a lecturer or for amateur theatricals,
while the orchestra for dances Is stationed
in the large hall.
This young woman soon found - that
everybody demanded refreshment of some
kind, and so she added catering to her
other business, and now serves anything
from tea and wafers to a full course din
ner. Persons who live In small apart
ments, poorly arranged houses or hotels
find this a most convenient arrangement,
for they escape all the trouble of get
ting ready for company and the disagree
able task of "cleaning up" afterward.
WOMEN once had a limited num
ber of ways of turning an hon
est penny, and there their op
portunities ended. There were
sewing, teaching, domestic ser
viceâwell, the list could be told
off on the fingers of one hand. To-day a
Brlareus with his hundred hands would
scarcely have fingers * enough to go
around. At the woman's exchanges It
seems as if some one is continually dis
covering a new path to a livelihood. Even
the managers, seasoned as they are by a
long experience in this line, are often
amazed at the Ingenious, and sometimes
Ingenuous, plans for capturing the dollar
which women once found so elusive.
One young woman has recently worked
up quite a business in exercising dogs.
She charges a fixed price per hour, has a
book in which she records her now nu
merous appointments, and, being 'an ex
cellent walker, she says that, aside from
the pleasing consciousness that they are
profitable, she really enjoys her prome
nades. A more recent applicant at one

will make the white hairs the color of the
rest of your hair, and this I cannot rec
ommend. I have never heard of the rec
ipe you sent me. Sage tea and alcohol
is an excellent tonic, but the other in
gredient mentioned I never even heard of.
so cannot advise you. Liquid powders
are so seldom used in these days that I
haven't formula for one that I consider,
good. If you will send mo a stamped
addressed envelope I will send you the
name of a prepared liquid powder that is
as good as any I know of.
E. S. S.â The hair frequently falls be
cause the roots are not sufficiently nour
ished. A good way to invigorate the hair
roots is to gently massage the scalp with
the finger tips dipped in clear, lukewarm
water. This brings the blood to the sur
face and removes the particles of dead
skin. At night apply the following ..nic
to the scalp: Two drams tincture of
cantharides, six drams essence of rose
mary and eleven ounces elder-flower
water. Also wear your hat as little as
possible.
ROONEY R.â The Beauty Talk last
Sunday will, I feel certain, have given
you ail the information you desired. If
not, write to me again.
MARIANâ Try fifteen grams of borax
dissolved In one ounce of lemon juice for
those bothersome little freckles. Apply
directly after coming in out of the sun
and again at bedtime. Follow each ap
plication with a smearing of cold cream.
To darken the eyebrows, boll slowly an
ounce of walnut bark in a pint of water
for one hour. "Set" the dye by adding
a lump of alum the size of a hazel nut.
Keep this in a bottle and apply to the
eyebrows with a small camel's hair,
brush. Massage the- bony neck each
night with equal parts of lanollne. cocoa
butter and coeoanut oil melted together.
IRENEâ Let me beg of you not to do
anything so foolish as to change the color
of your hair. You are sure to regret It
if you do, for as the hair grows out the
natural color the roots will have to be
touched up and you will find it the great
est nuisance imaginable. The sample
you sent me is a very rich, pretty color,
and probably harmonizes with your skin
and eyes better than would an artificial
color. Now please don't vote Mme. Hy
geia "a disagreeable old thing." but be a
sensible little girlie and make up your
mind to let well enough alone. Are we
still friends? : "; y

of the exchanges announced that she
wanted to wash pet cats! She said that
she was particularly fond of cats, and as
they ought to be washed, she thought. her
offer might fill a want which would prove
to be real, even if it had not been long
felt. Two or three young women write
verses to orderâ verses of the kind which
may be described as dinner poetry;
rhymes with a personal flavor, familiar
features of many social functions.
A country girl, whose accomplishments
ln the dairy line were not in demand in
the city, happened to mention incident
ally that she could handle a saw and
hammer as easily as most women manage
a needle and thimble. She was soon en
gaged to teach a rich woman's small son,
who had a yearning for carpenter's tools,
how to use them without danger to life
and limb. It is a universal blessing that
women are learning to put to use their
own individual talents or accomplish
ments. Once the girl who now wants to
wash cats would have been spoiling tern â¢
pers and dresses, and the country girl ac
customed to a hammer and a saw would
have been making Impossible desserts.
Truly, the world grows not only better,
but more sensible.
THERE is scarcely any branch in
which medicine has not advanced
within the last twenty years, but
ln no one branch has more im
provement been shown than in the
compounding and putting together
of drugs. No more is the unwilling pa
tient made to swallow large doses of nau
seating medicine, for sugar-coated pills,
capsules and wafers have come into
use and patients can now take the most
vile tasting medicines without any dis
comfort. Now comes along a Frenchman
with a still more Ingenious plan which
opens up to pharmacy unbounded possi
bilities of going still further ahead.
On account of the difficulty of assimila
ting Iron as a medicine a French drug
gist has sought to Introduce It in a digest
ible way by what he terms ferruginous
eggs.
Hens can digest Iron easily, while ren
dering it back through the albumen of
their eggs in a form which is easily di
gested by the weaker stomach of man
kind. A salt of iron Is given to the hens
with grains of wheat. A dozen of these
medicated grains of wheat a day makes
the hens, after three or four days, lay
eggs, which are very rich In Iron already
digested. y- '"'- ' 'â [' v â : ._,
The Frenchman is experimenting fur
ther with other drugs, and it Is not with
out the bounds of possibility that we shall
shortly be able to take all our medicine
in the form of eggs.

TAKE them, my boy, and do 'with
them as you please after I am
gone."
So spoke Robert Browning shortly
before he died as he gave into the
hands of his son an inlaid box con
taining the love letters that had passed
between himself and Elizabeth Barrett
before he married her. They were all
there side by side, and none were ever
written afterward, because the two were
never separated after this wedding.
And now it has pleased the son, Robert
W. B. Browning, the artist, to publish
1 Whether this is just right is a question
some of us may have difficulty in decid
ing for ourselves. book at it from an
unselfish standpoint and there is a harsh
ness about the act. Even the son must
have felt this, for he begins his book
with an excuse, as if he were a little
ashamed of what he had done. He says
that he had to either publish the letters
or destroy th.-m. and the latter he felt
he had no right to do. The reader can
judge of this aspect of the case for him
self. . .
Certainly no tenderer love story was
ever written than is revealed in these let
ters as the\ r appear in book form in the
sequence of their writing. 'Tis the love
story of a poet and poetess told in their
correspondence. '7'il, ,
The story of the Browning courtship in
Its larger outlines is a familiar one. In
the book the more intimate details are
filled in. Mrs. Browning, as Miss Bar
rett, had been an ardent worshiper of her
great contemporary long before she met
him. In her "i_ady Geraldine's Court
ship." published in 1844, she makes the
peasant poet, her hero, read to his lady
love passages from ancient poets:
Or at times a modern volume, Wordsworth's
solemn, thoughtful Idyl.
Howitt's ballad verse, or Tennyson s en-
chanted reverie â
Of from Browning some "Pomegranate,
which if cut deep down the middle,
Shows a heart within, blood tinctured, of a
veined humanity.
Browning at the time was absent from
England. He, on his side, had known and
appreciated at its true worth the poetic
value of Miss Barrett's work. He, how
ever, had never sought to intrude his far
off admiration upon the author's person
ality The poets had, indeed, a mutual
friend in Miss Barrett's cousin, Mr. Ken
yon. But from John Kenyon Browning
had learned the sad facts of his relative's
life So far back as 1840 she had burst a
blood vessel in the lungs, and after a
twelvemonth's confinement at her home,
In London, had been ordered to a milder
climate. With some relatives she had
taken up her residence in Torquay. There
a fatal event had taken place. Her favor
ite brother, with two of his friends, hav
ing embarked on board a small vessel for
a sail of a few hours, the boat had gone
down. All on hoard had perished.
It was long before Miss Barrett s health

shock to allow of her being brought home
again to London, where many years

Browningâ
But why retell a story which Browning
himself has recalled reverently and ten
derly in one of these very letters written
shortly after his engagement:
"Always remember," he reminds Miss
Barrett. "I never wrote you, all the years,
on the strength of your poetry, though I
constantly heard of you through Mr. K.
and was near seeing you once, and might
have easily availed myself of his inter
vention to commend any letter to your
notice, so as to reach you out of the fool
ish crowd of rushers-in upon genius, who
come and eat their bread and cheese on
the high altar, and talk of reverence with
out one of its surest instinctsâ never quiet
till they cut their initials on the cheek of
the Medicean Venus to prove they wor
ship her."
This first letter written by Browning
was graciously answered by the Invalid,
and so a correspondence began that was
not for some months to ripen Into actual
acquaintanceship. Little by little, how
ever, you see how the two kindred souls
were brought into nearer relationship.
The letters, begun formally enough, grew
more and more intimate. The correspond
ents exchange views on life, on philoso
phy, on literature, on each other's poems.
Then the personal note begins to Inter
vene. On March 12. 1845. we find Brown
ing saying: "Will you grant me a great
favor? Always when you write, though
about your own works, not Greek plays
merely, put me in. always, a little e>rn
clal bulletin line that shall say. 'I am bet
ter,' or 'still better,' will you?" And a
little further along in the same letter
crops in the query, "Do you think I shall
see you In two months, three months.
Then the writer passes on to a denuncia
tion of society, which Miss Barrett feels
the need of as a means of self-develop
ment "For me," he exclaims, "I always
hated have put up with It these six or
seven years past, lest by foregoing it I
should let some unknown good escape me,
in the true time of it, and only discover
mv fault when too late; and now that I

God." . _,â*,_.,
Miss Browning's answer Is dated
March 20. 1845. "It was kind of you. she
begins, "to wish to know how I was. and

THE SAN / FRANCISCO CALL., SUNDAY, MARCH 19, 1899.
GOSJ OF MAQAZINES.
It becomes every' year a more costly
business to float an important periodical.
I see that Mr. Harmsworth of the London
Mall and a dozen other publications, dis
cussed at the recent annual meeting of
the shareholders of his company, that it
had cost $100,000 to Introduce the new
Harmsworth Magazine and get out the
first four numbers. That is a pretty good
sum--SIOO,OOO, and four numbers, even in
the swiftest flight to success, don't carry
a periodical so very far.
Yet this is about what any one must be
equal to. If he would undertake to found a
new monthly or weekly. People who un
dertake these ventures without knowing
well beforehand what they require are
apt to make the mistake of supposing
that when they have figured out, with
reasonable cleverness, the- cost of produc
ing a single number, and have made
financial provision for paying such a sum
at the required intervals through a cer
tain term, the provision is ample.
Editing so much, literature so much,
and art, typesetting, printing, paper, bind
ing, distributing, and so forth, all so much
more: this Is a comparatively easy sum.
It leaves out of calculation the cost of
getting your publication known; and that
is perhaps the toughest of all the prob
lems. You can produce a year s numbers
(that is, twelve numbers) of a very good
magazine, in editions of pretty good size,
for $60,000 or $70,000. But there has been
as much as the larger of these sums, and
probably more, spent by a single period
ical in the course of three months simply
In advertising itself in other periodicals.
Add to this the cost of circulars and reg
ular and special notices, distributed for
the most part through the mall, and see
what a total results as the cost merely of
selling your -production.
The effort a few years ago to conjure
with a familiar name and revive a period
ical long since defunct ls said to have cost
each of three or four successive owners a
small fortune. Every penny of the large
expenditure went for naught, --id the at
tempt had finally to be entirely aban
doned.

a lonely life, growing green like the grass

the grass. And so time passed and passed

awarded a handsome prize.
The new parlor Instituted at 'Hollister
No. 105, has been named Copa de Oro (Pun

Interesting and entertaining party to

sworn to keep mum as to what the en

. WOODMEN OF THE WORLD.
Last Monday night Golden Gate Camp, '
Woodmen of the World, after the close
of routine business, opened wide Its doors
and admitted a number of friends into
Shasta Hall, Native Sons* building, after !
which the membership and visitors were
treated to a select programme of enter
tainment which had been arranged by
John S. Patterson, George J. Strong and
E. McCourtney, the social committee. !
This included an overture on the piano !
by Professor Welsel, a cornet solo by Mr. j
Maynard and then a tenor solo by J. H. '
Desmond, followed "by selections on the I
gramophone introduced. by the most mod- '
est member of the camp, fancy dancing
by the Misses Kaufman, a violin solo by
Miss Guthrie, accompanied by Miss
Sehernstein; a recitation by Miss Rear
don, a song by Mr. Garratt and other j
numbers, .which kept the company to- !
gether until after 11 o'clock.
The camp has on the tapis a proposition
breathe) that I had stood blind In this
temple I was about to leaveâ that I had
seen no human nature, that my brothers
and sisters of the earth were names to
me; that I had beheld no great mountain
or river, nothing, in fact. I was as a
man dying who had not read Shakes
peare, and it was too late! Do you un
derstand?
"And do you also know what a disad
vantage this ignorance is to my art?
Why, if I live on and yet do not escape
from this seclusion, do you not perceive
that I labor under signal disadvantages
âthat I am, in a manner, as a blind poet?
Certainly there is a. compensation to a
degree. I have had much of the inner
life, and from the habit of self-conscious
ness and self-analysis I have made great
guesses at human nature in the main.
But how willingly I would, as a poet, ex
change some of this lumbering, ponder
ous, helpless knowledge of books for some
experience of life and man."
Browning In reply urges that all you
gain from society and travel Is the dis
covery that you have gained nothing, and
have done rightly in trusting your innate
ideasâ not rightly in distrusting them,
as the case may be. *â¢*â¢
The letters follow in their order and
show how the poet and poetess grew
eloper and closer In their sentiments, un
til they met and courted.
Here is a charming passage In which
Browning attempts to elucidate his feel
ings for his fiancee: "Now, love, I do be
lieveânow, when I am utterly blest In
this gift of your love, and least able to
Imagine what I should do without itâ l
cannot but believe, I say, that had you
given me once a 'refusal' clearly derived
from your own feelings,' and quite apart
from any fancied consideration for my in
terestsâhad this come upon me, whether
slowly but inevitably in the course of
events, or suddenly as precipitated by
any step of mme â I should, believing you,
have never again renewed directly or in
directly such solicitation; I should have
begun to count how many other ways
were yet open to serve you and devote
myself to youâ but from the outside, now,
and not in your livery! For your own
part in that matter, seeing: it with all
the light you have since given me (and
then not inadequately by my own light),
I could. I do kiss your feet, kiss every
letter in your name, bless you with my
whole heart and soul if I could pour them
out, from me, before you, to stay and
be yours; when I think on your motives
and pure, perfect generosity. -
It was on September 12. 1546, that all
deception came to an end with the pri
vate marriage at St. Marylebone Parish
Church of Elizabeth Barrett to Robert
Browning. "It was a runaway match,"
notes the gossip. Miss Mitford. "Never
was I so much astonished. He prevailed
on her to meet him at church with only
the two necessary witnesses. They went
by rail to Southampton, crossed to Havre,
up the Seine to Rouen, to Paris by rail
way. Here they. stayed a week. Happen
ing to meet with Mrs. Jameson, she joined
them in their journey to Pisa."
At Pisa the couple remained six months,
and then settled in Florence. It may be i
added that Mr. Barrett never forgave his* i
daughter's preference of her lover and I
husband for him, notwithstanding all ap
peals. At Casa Guidi, in Florence, made
famous by her sonnets, her son, her own
young Florentine, Robert Barrett Brown
ing, now the painter and sculptor, was
born on March 9, 1849, two and a half ,
years after her marriage. At Casa Guidi,
Mrs. Browning died in 1861. Harper Broth

A Summing Up of This Week and a Forecast of Next.
* \ ff R * EL ' L ' IS has llve d UP to his
MR. ELLIS promises. up to has
steepest promises. He has
\l I brought to San Francisco a
_._.Y__L company thoroughly equipped
for the operas in its repertory.
Up to the time of writing (Saturday
morning) we have had five per
formances, all of which but one have
been artistically complete in both in
tention and execution. The "Faust"
opening was not all that we expected,
owing principally to the smothering of
half the orchestra in a patent "shell"
that had been built under the apron of
the stage, but even with this disad
vantage the spell of Melba's Marguerite
made itself felt; so the night was by
no means wasted. Since then the mu
sicians have been in sight and sound
of the audience, and we have come to
find out that the New York symphony
orchestra is the finest operatic orches
tra in the country, as fine, perhaps, as
any in the world. The orchestral direc
tion of Seppilli has been notably good.
His authority over his bandsmen is ab
solute, and in the various operas he has
displayed a remarkable versatility, sat
urating himself, so to speak, in the
musical atmosphere of each piece. The
man who can play with equal success
such vastly different scores as those of
"Aida," "Boheme" and "Carmen" is
' a leader of prodigious resource. Sep
pillt is the true virtuoso, and when all
ls over he will not be the least remem
bered artist of our first big Ellis season.
Since the opening night the perform
ances have sustained a steady standard
of excellence. The ensembles have been
as .nearly perfect as one could expect
to hear them, the scenlng and robing
have been generous and artistic, and
the stage management of William
Parry has been the best that San Fran
cisco has ever known. Melba, in Mar
guerite and in Mimi, has more than
lived up to her promise of last season
in the lighter and more ornamental
operas. She has been something more
than the greatest vocalist of the period.
She has given us delicate, beautiful Im
personations. And the season has by
no means been a Melba season, despite
the fact that the big crowds have been
provincial enough to turn out only on
Melba nights. "We have had the operas,
with the singers that belonged in them.
Gadski, De Lussan and Chalia have
given distinguished performances of
parts to which their voices and tem
-.lents are specially adapted.
Among the m_n Ceppi has contrib
uted a good robust Rhadames, Bou
douresque a lithe, humor-lit Mephis
topheles; Pandolfini has done well In
every thing except "Faust," and Ben
saude, by his versatility and staying
powers, unaided has held up the bary
tone end of the casts with honor. Bon
'* nard, although not at his best in the
â¢ opening scenes of "Carmen," gave a
splendid Don Jose before the perform
ance was over, and instantly took rank
as the best tenor of the company. With
the exception of the one disaster al
ready mentioned the season, so far as
It has gone, has been a vigorous suc
cess. Quite naturally It has been a
stirring event in San Francisco, and
the newspapers have devoted pictorial
: and reportorial attention to it that,
would he deemed excessive in the
greater cities of the East. But for a
long time real opera has been very
rare with us. and almost any amount
of enthusiasm (journalistic and other
wise) may be pardoned on this occasion.
We can become more urban after a
while. Mr. Ellis has given San Fran
cisco a permanent place on his map
and Grau is watching us with a kindly
eye.
Â» â¢ â¢
This, the second and last week of the
Ellis season, will open to-morrow night
with "The Huguenots," employing, as
far as the resources of the company
admit, an "all-star" cast. Melba will
be the Marguerite, Gadski the Valen
tine. De Lussan the L'rbano, Ceppi the
R'aoul, Boudouresque the Marcel, Ben
saude the Nevers and Rains the St.
Bris. With these singers and the great
orchestra and chorus the ensemble
should be tremendous.
On Tuesday night "Bnheme" will be
repeated with practically the same cast
as before. Its triumph of last Wednes
day night is now a matter of local his
tory. <â¢:
Another success, "Aida," will be re
peated Wednesday night, with Gadski
and Ceppi in the cast.
Thursday night will be a big one, for
then Melba will sing for the first time
here a role In which her fame is largely
i identifiedâ Juliet in Gounod's setting of
Shakespeare's love tragedy. Bonnard
will be the Romeo.
De Lussan will repeat her vivid
Carmen on Friday night. For the fare
well Saturday matinee a double bill of
"Lucia" and "Pagliacci" will be given.
Chalia will again be heard as Nedda in
the Leoncavallo piece, a part In which
â¢she made a vital hit last Tuesday night.
Melba will sing Lucia. We heard her
last season in the "mad scene," and can
safely anticipate some matchless feats
in coloratura singing.
The suggestion offered in an earlier
issue of The Call, that Seppilli and the
orchestra give a Sunday night concert,
will probably be acted on. If so Gadski
will sing from the Wagner operas that
we were compelled to miss.
ASHTON STEVEN'S.
Jhe Columbia.
We will have both kinds of opera In
town till? week, for our old popular
friends, the Bostonlans, open at the Co
lumbia to-morrow night. Their comic
opera is "Rob Roy," written by De
Koven and Smith, an established favorite
in the East, but brand new to us. The
story of "Rob Roy" has more or less to
do with Scott's romance of the same
name. The composer ls credited with
having caught the local atmosphere and
written some music that is quite as tak
ing, if indeed more ambitious, than tbat
of "Robin Hood."
â¢ Mac Donald will be the chief of the Mac-
Gregor clan, Wiilian I^avln will be the
" Young Pretender, Jessie Bartlett Davis
will be the Flora Mat Donald, daughter of
' the chief of the Clan Donald, and Henry
Clay Barnabee, tin* juvenile prodigy, will
be the provost, MacWheeble. Helen Ber
tram, who is now the leading soprano
( f the organization, will appear as the
Provost's daughter, and Frothingham
" will be his henchman, Taminal Mac-
Sorlie. William Broderick, Josephine
Bartlett and Harry Brown will appear
â¢-respectively as Lochiel of Cameron, Cap
tain Ralph Sheridan and Sandy Mc-
Sherry.

favorites in San Francisco. Their per

they have everything their own way.
Ths /\!caza-.
"Nerves," a farcical three-act comedy
from the French of "Les Femmes Ner
veuses," by J. Comyns Carr, will be
played by the stock company of the Al
cazar this week. Feminine nerves are
made the base of excuse of two very pet
ulent dispositions fostered by Mrs. Cap- <
tain Armatage and her mother, Mrs. Brit
tle. The former, though hardly out of her
honeymoon, with everything to live for,
possesses one of the most disagreeable
dispositions imaginable. The mother is
even worse than her spoiled daughter, and
to the husbands home and life is not j
worth the living. What devilment the
young woman does not invent herself the
old one does, and so on it goes, that two
families are in a turmoil all the time and |
several servants and others that cross
their path are drawn into the web of do
mestic discord. Two acts are thus taken
up. The last act finds the tables com
pletely turned around, for the young Mrs.
Armatage in a fit of temper writes a love
note to a certain French confectioner, and
when it is found out and she discovered
In his apartments by her husband and
mother the real climax is reached, and
when the curtain rings down two very
much penetent women fall into 'heir hus
bands' arms vowing that a husband is a
pleasure as well as a necessity.
Jhe TiVo
"The Mikado." Gilbert and Sullivan's
most popular satire, will be revived at
the Tivoli this week. The cast will In

The new week's b..l at the Orpheum In
cludes five new acts. Mr. and Mrs. Robyns
come with their little comedy, "Straight
Tip Jim," which is credited with having
made the Eastern vaudeville hit of the
season. The Gypsy Quintet are said to be
about the best in their class that have
ever appeared at the Orpheum. Charles
King, the famous tenor of "The Little
Church Around the Corner," is one of the
stars of the quintet. The D'ArteS come
from the FoUes Bergere, Paris, and in
their line are said to be very clever.
Barmes and Sisslon come with a new act
introducing new songs and dances. Percy
Henri is a musical specialist of note.

TOO MANY DECEPTIONS.
Good Reasons Why an Insurance Pol-
icy Was Not Paid.
Underlying a decision of the Supreme
Court rendered yesterday is the implied
advice, "Do not try to deceive an insur
ance company." Mrs. Gertrude K. Bayley
sued the Employers' Liability Assurance
Corporation to recover the amount of a
policy on the life of her husband, /who
was killed by accident. In the lower court
she was successful In her suit.
The contention of the company was
that, first, the Insured had represented
that he had never been proposed and de
clined by any other company, and, second,
that he had never previously received
compensation from any other company on
a policy for accidents sustained. It was
conclusively shown that both statements
were untrue. The contention of the widow
was that at the time the statement was
made that Bayley had not received com
pensation for accident injuries the agent
of the defendant knew well that it was
false. And further, that knowing this and
accepting the money and issuing the pre
mium was a waiver on the part of the
company. _Â__â¢ _"- "V
In a former decision by Justice Temple
the law was established in these words:
"Nor are misstatements fatal to the claim
of the plaintiff which the agent well knew
to be false when he made out the applica-
tion, received the money and Issued the
policy." This was all well so far as the
widow's claim went, but it was shown
that back of the knowledge of the com
pany's agent of one accident there was
still another accident of which the agent
knew nothing. In fact, the insured had
met with several accidents of which the
defendant had no knowledge, and on the
several deceptions the judgment of the
lower court was reversed.

Boneless Wonder.
ETHEL LYNWOOD is one of the most
remarkable contortionists in the
world. Human boa constrictor would
be the better name for her, as she
ties herself into knots and unties her
self as easily as the ordinary mortal
walks The average contortionist prides
himself on a back, a forward or a side
bend but Lynwood accomplishes them all.
When she "performs her first feat, walking
through her hands, she actually turns her
arms completely in the sockets. As the
arm turns under one hears a little snap
that in the ordinary person would mean
dislocation, but with Ethel Lynwood the
member slips easily and smoothly Into
Her height is five feet three inches,
weight 125 pounds, and withal she is one
of the few perfectly proportioned and de
veloped women. She is fleet of foot, wil
lowy of figure and with a rather small
head, crowned with short brown hair, and
admirably poised on square, broad shoul
ders that might easily cause a tinge of
envy to thrill the heart of many an ath
lete of the sterner sex.
In one respect she Is really built differ
ently from other people, for she has more
loose or floating ribs than the normal in
dividual, and this is a great advantage in
â¢her wor'_. She is a German Jewess, just
22 yea -i old. and while she Is not strictly
beautiful she has good features and
"makes up" most effectively.
"My success," says Miss Lynwood, "is
largely due to constant practice. I had
a natural love for athletic sports of all
kinds. Inherited from my father, who not
only taught gymnastics in a college but
was also uctor in a large turn verein
'in Germany. I was a small boned and
loose jointed child, and at an early age
developed a passion for all sorts of sports.
In this I was encouraged by my father,
who personally trained me. When I was
six years old I commenced my profes
sional career." ~

THE HAY MARKET.
The circular of Scott & Magner says of
Pay:
"Arrivals of Hay during this week have con
tinued moderate. The total quantity received
has been but 1564 tons. The market opened
up the first of the week very strong and ac- |
tive, and an advance on ail qualities waa
noted. The long looked for and welcome rain
that has at last reached the State has dis
turbed trading a little. It is expected by ,
many of the consumers that the rains should ;
have" a weakening effect on the Hay market,
but this expectation may not be realized to
any extent. The stocks of Hay on hand avail- |
able for the San Francisco market are con
sidered moderate, and it is still an open ques
tion what the course of the market may ]*Â»
when the weather again settles. The feeling
here at this time tends toward a steady
market."
The circular of George Morrow & Co. says:
"The rain caused wheat and barley to drop
good and hard. Oats ami hay are unaffected, !
because the visible supply Is so light that it j
is doubtful If both oats and hay do not be- j
come scarce before the new crops are avail- .
able. One must remember fills came near
being the second dry' year.
"The market has not wavered or weakened j
a particle. True the buoyant dry season has
happily been dispelled, but the demand con
tinues good."

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 18.â The change in
stock prices compared with yesterday was very
narrow. In the early trading prices drifted
downward, notably Continental Tobacco, â¢ In
ternational Paper, Glucose, American Steel
and Wire, Brooklyn Transit, Burlington, Texas
â¢and Paclflc and Metropolitan Street Railway.
The movement seemed to be in the nature of
discounting an unfavorable bank statement,
for when it was published, showing a de
crease of over $4, 000.000. ln the surplus reserve,
but a contraction of some three and a half
millions in loans, a covering of soft con
tracts set ln. Metropolitan, Brooklyn Rapid
.Transit and most of the other stocks which
had shown earlier recessions were lifted smart
ly. Interest very largely centered in Sugar
again to-day, and the stock closed within a
â¢ fraction of the high point, 172%, yesterday's
closing being 164%. Tennessee Coal and Iron
also showed Improvement on the day. There
â¢were declines of from fractions to 3 per cent
In Tobacco and some of the new Industrials,
'including Continental Tobacco, International
.Paper, American Tin Plate and American Steel
end AA'lre. The railways left off practically
on a parity with yesterday's closing. The
market closed strong and active.
The stock market was of a very professional
character throughout the week, with standard
shares generally receding, as did a number of
'unseasoned Industrials, but Sugar was marked
up over 30 points, with some Influence on cer
tain stocks. The money market was the all
Important Influence, call money averaging 4
per cent, although at one time it touched 6.
There was a reflex easing in sterling exchange
and a hardening of money rates ln all the
.markets. Banks were In receipt of urgent
requests for notes, especially* from .Western
banks, but the scarcity of currency here was
reflected in the payment early this morning
of 8 per cent of the customs duties in gold.
The payment of $6,000,000 to the Government
In partial payment of the Central Paclflc ob
ligation, together with the purchase of Chi
cago and Alton stock, for which a large sum
â¢was transferred to the former owners, were
partly responsible for the hardening ln the
money market. An unfavorable bank state
ment had been expected, and when it ap
peared there was some covering. The de
crease in surplus reserve of over $4,000,000 was
thought to be largely due to those special
transactions. The uncertainty at this season
regarding winter wheat, together with predic
tions that February net traffic returns would
,not be up to expectations, had a depressing
â Influence in the railways. On the other hand,
earnings for the flrst week in March showed
"an increase of about 1 per cent. The de
crease of some eight and a quarter million
dollars in value of the excess of the Febru
ary exports, compared with last year, was a
subject of comment ln relation to our foreign
"trade situation, but that it was showing in
crease ln tho exports of manufactured articles
â¢was the source of gratification.
The signing of the peace treaty by the Queen
Regent of Spain being expected, caused, no
response in the market. The industrials and
specialties were more prominent in the deal
ings than at any time hitherto. All the ad
vances of note were made In securities of this
class, with Sugar the leader. This stock after
remaining comparatively steady suddenly
sprang into activity on Thursday on transac
tions of over a quarter of a million shares, rose
29% polnls above the price of the previous day,
reaching 170, and then reacted to 151, and on
Saturday it again rushed up to 172%.- Various
rumor? attended the remarkable movement in
Sugar. All these stories met prompt denial.
Among the other notable advances were New
York Air Brake 19%, Tobacco 13%, Brooklyn
Rapid Transit 7%, Glucose 7%, while Chicago
Terminal. Great Northern preferred. People's
Gas. Tennessee Coal and Iron and Iron and
Metropolitan Street Railway were up about 4

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEAA' YORK, March IS.â The Financier says:
The statement of the New York Clearing-house
banks for the week ending March 18 ls not as j
unfavorable as the changes at first sight might 1
indicate. The averages were made over a
period covering some unusually large opera
tions, and in addition to this the full effect of
the previous week's transfer of $6,000,000 of Pa
cific payments to the Treasury has been In- |
eluded In the current exhibit. This accounts
In large part for the decrease of over $6,000,000
ln specie reported, although it does not explain
the contraction In full, since one or more heavy â 
consignments of specie have been received from I
the AA'est in the meantime. The settlement of
the Chicago and Alton deal was responsible for |
a great deal of shifting of funds, and this ;
duobtless has had no small part ln determin- j
ing the character of the statement. An im
portant feature of the report Is the contrac
tion of $3,593,000 in loans, which In the last
two weeks have fallen off over $6,600,000. The
higher rates ruling in money perhaps Influenced
some liquidation, but the consummation of sev
eral Industrial deals and lessened Stock Ex
change transactions are to be taken into ac
count. The call of loans of course strengthens
the position of the banks. The decrease of I
$7.803**,500 In deposits lessened reserve liability;
more than $2,000,000, so that despite the loss of
$6 000,000 in cash the excess reserve ls only a
little over $4,000,000 less. It Is Interesting to
observe that there was a slight Increase ln
legal tenders, showing the effect of money that
i has been received from the Interior. While it
is idle to predict what forthcoming bank state
ments may show It is yet true that the banks
begin to recover from their spring contraction
about the' end of March and from that time
into the crop season accumulate funds rapidly.
The money market, therefore, ought to show
I decided ease within a very short time. The
decrease of over $500,000 in the circulation of
the banks last week certainly indicates a feel-
I Ing that the market ls not ln a dangerous con
dition, for If this were the case circulation
would expand rather than contract.
LONDON MARKET.

j with which trading commenced, but the most
important was the fact that the selling pres
| sure was greatly relaxed. This led a good
1 many operators to believe that the heavy li
quidation of the past three days had about run
Its course. Another strengthening Influence was
an advance of %d to %d ln the Liverpool mar
ket, whereas a decline had been confidently
looked for. Furthermore, the weather bureau
announced that a cold wave was threatening the
wheat fields in the Southwest. There were also
many bad crop reports, and as many were ac
companied by buying orders, the reports at
i tracted considerable attention. New York re
ported that foreigners were more inclined to
buy for export, American wheat being for the
moment the cheapest in the market. It was an
evening uu trade to a considerable extent and
shorts were in anticipation of an upturn Mon
day. May opened %c to lc higher, at 67%@67%c,
improved to 67% c, then reacted to 67%@67%c.
and closed at 67U(367%c.
Complete Indifference of the foreign market
to the decline here yesterday, together with
light receipts, strengthened corn. May im
proved %c to %c.
There was quite a large business In oats.
Free selling by longs, however, caused a re
action from the ton. May closed %c to %c
higher.
Provisions started at an advance, but near
the end of the session sellers found buyers well
supplied and the early gain was lost. May
pork left off unchanged and lard 2%c lower.
Ribs unchanged.

by the small quantity of foreign coals arriving
for the past several months. The storm of this
week has Isjcreased household consumption
largely, delivery wagons have been on the run
filling orders. The general liberal rainfall
throughout the State has changed entirely the
future aspect of the coal market, as ship
owners will now solicit charters to carry for
eign fuel here, where last week they demanded
fancy figures for the business. Already oruers
are being sought after at a generous discount
on the asking rates prevailing a few weeks
ago." :-'â¢'. : ~ â¢â¢â ; .

_ , two of their enemies were be
fore them and that the third was hidden in the same room.
"How has the knowledge of magic gained since we were last to
gether, brothers?" asked King Atrophole.
This was a challenge for all the magicians to do their greatest
feats.
"Let me begin," said King Atrophole. "I will show you our three
enemiesâ Egbert, Arthur and Alfred."
The Three Princes did not know whether they had been found
out. They were so brave and so cool that they did not even start
surrounded as they were by hundreds of their enemiesâ none of whom
suspcted them.
'. King Atrophole held up a globe- of red liquid and set fire to it.
He then placed the globe on the banquet table and addressed it in
these words:
â * v * "ALL SECRETS ' IN YOUR DEPTHS I'D SEE.
REVEAL TO US THE PRINCES THREE."
The blazing liquid turned into fiery bubbles, and every bubble
held a picture telling of the lives of the Three Princes. There was
the home in which they had passed their childhood; then they were
at school and at college; there they were as young menâ setting out
to fight giants; then there was a view of the kingdom of the good.
King under the spell placed upon it by the wicked Atollâ the
little 'children crying in the streets, and the animals running wild
through the towns and cities. Then came the scene upon the cliff
where Atoll let the Three Princes see the peril of the Lady of the
Black Robe. Next was a scene showing Egbert upon his lonely rock
in the ocean. Alfred in his dungeon under ground and Arthur flounder
ing to get out of the deadly quicksand. ,
Egbert knew that he must break the globe or it would presently
shew how he got into the Kingdoms of Zykobar and then he would
killed before the eyes of all the black dwarfs. One blow with his
sword and the globe was shattered into one thousand Pieces.
"Enough, enough, good Atrophole, of that," said Egbert "We
have seen that you are the greatest of magicians. Let us think no

HE feast of the three Kings
of Zykobar was ready. All the
great magicians were there.
Arthur half-famished, for he
had not eaten for many hours,
looked on hungrily from his
hiding place in the case of a
great, old-fashioned clock,
peeking through the keyhole.
He could see and hear all that
was said. He saw through the
disguise of his brother Egbert,
Who was now a King. He also
saw and knew his brother Al
fred, who was dressed like a
farmer. Egbert and Alfred
here met for the first time
since the Three Princes were
separated. Both wondered
what had become of Arthur,
and both naturally wondered
at the strange chance that had
brought them together under
such conditions. They said
nothing and no one of .-the
black dwarfs dreamed that

somehow, in a way she never could ex
plain, this little boy, looking up at her
with his bright eyes, quite won her
heart. Was there ever a nicer boy
than this c-ne? she asked herself. Noth
ing could prevent her taking him in,
light then and there, and doing every
thing she could him within her nar
row means. He was not lost appar
ently, judging from his happy, content
ed manner.
But where did he came from and
whither was he going? He didn't tell,
and she, odd as it may seem, forgot to
ask.
The boy, evidently, soon felt at home
and allowed the ferrryman's wife to
make him as comfortable as she want
ed. He made friends quickly and chat
ted busily and pleasantly, in a way
quite old and wise, too, for so small a
boy. He made the sober ferryman's
wife feel gay and young again. She
listened and laughed and wondered and
time sped on. He sang a little song,
so sweet and beautiful was it that she
sat as if bewitched. For long years

more of the Three Princes, for they must surely be dead. They never
could have escaped not being magicians as we are â from the rock,
the pit and the quicksand. Let as see what our brother can show
to us." '
Atrophole would have been very angry had he not been so flat
tered by Egbert, who saw that he liked flattery.
Forth then stood King Atreus to give proof of his skill in magic.
"I am the King, indeed, of magicians," said King Atreus. "I will
now give proof. I plant weeds in the fields and, behold, when the
harvest is ripe, I reap every season a new and strange crop. Ho,
Balthazar, stand forth." '"*â¢Â«*. _ . _ _
Now Balthazar was the name of that black dwarf who had been
carried off by a Roc when Prince Alfred so strangely reached the
Three Kingdoms. As Balthazar was not there to come forward Prince
Alfred stood forth in his place.
"What have you grown this year, Balthazar, from my seed.'
asked King Atreus.
"You shall see." . _,
Alfred had in one of his pockets the seeds of a strange and
mighty vine, which is proof against most magic. These seeds he had
found in the desert.
"Waterâ a dish of pure water."
A deep bowl of water was placed before Prince Alfred.
"Two sharp swords." _,-__â¢__Â«. 'â _â¢â  , tv ._...
"Bring'the swords for Balthazar," commanded the King, and they
were brought. . â Â â_.___
"I will grow you a plant before your very eyes. said Prince
Alfred, "which shall grow as never before plant has grown. I will
show you fruit such as never has been seen in all the Three Kingdoms,
and you shall all feast to your content. Lo, the time of growing and
the time of showing is here." ,_,,,_
Saying these words Prince Alfred cast into the deep bowl filled
with water a handful of seeds. ...
â¢Well done, Balthazar," said King Atreus. 'I will give to him
who can stay the growth of this plant my crown and my kingdom.
There is none who can kill the plant when once it has taken root.
Now this King was wicked. He wished only to make the other
Kings envious of his power and he had planned with one of his fol
lowers to overturn the water bowl at a sign. What was his astonish

THE STRANGE LITTLE VISITOR
after the melody in those tones lingered
in her memory. How came this little
boy by so wonderful a voice?
The clock struck the hour and she
rose with great agitation from her old
wicker rocker, exclaiming:
"Why, boy, I've forgotten the ferry
man, a thing that has never happened
before. Dear me, how could I? A half
hour ago I should have been down at

besides, was nicely rested by this time.
"Yes, come. If the ferryman is near

might disappear if she left him. â¢ The

On reaching f the, bank the old wife
looked with anxious eyes across the
river to see if her husband was coming.
Yes, far, far on the other side she saw
him slowly making his way. Ao old
bent man with long gray beard, he was,
but though his figure was bent he
seemed strong and muscular, as indeed
he was. Satisfied that all was well, the
ferryman's wife returned with her little
guest.
"We'll* have a nice, cozy supper to
gether, you and I," spoke she on reach
ing the cottage kitchen, "as the ferry
man doesn't come home till late to
night. He has been rowing great num
bers of people across to-day. Something
must have happened on the other side."
"Does he blow a horn, lady, to let
you know when he lands?" the boy
asked, thinking if he did he would run
down to meet him. -:,.;--â¢.Â»
"Dear me, no," replied she. "The
ferryman comes and goes at any time
and so silent and quiet is he that I
often do not know when he is around.
Noise of any kind disturbs him and the
dipping of his oars in the water is the
only music his ear enjoys."
"Strange old ferryman!" exclaimed
the boy thoughtfully. He* ate the simple
supper the ferryman's I wife prepared
and after this both lapsed into an un
usual silence which was quite soothing
to the boy. for he was soon nodding
drowsily. Hi 3 hostess saw this, touched
him gently and bade him follow her.
Into a smalL soft bed he crept, and
ment when the plant, taking root, suddenly shot long arms in all
directions. Like a devil fish the arms clung to everything that they
touched and with the strength of steel wires. So rapidly did the
devil fish plant spread that before King Atreus could give the signal
for the bowl to be broken the plant had wrapped itself around the
arms of his friend, who was to have helped him to fool the other
magicians. Yes, more than that, it had in the space of a minute
bound its steel wires around fifty magicians and did not spare King
Atreus, who was now fettered by so many bands that he could hardly
breathe. Every second the bands squeezed harder. ~
All the magicians tried to either overturn the bowl or kilr the
plant. All in vain. Alfred, who had become a master of magic,
stood by, smiling, and the plant did not come near him. No other
person could safely near the bowl for the magic plant drew in and
made a prisoner of every one that it could reach. How it spread!
Soon half the banquet hall was filled with its waving arms that were
feeling for new victims. The magicians saw with fear and with
wonder that whenever they cut off one of the arms of the plant the
severed arm falling upon the floor of the room at once took root
and from it a new plant sprang up with dozens of devil fish arms.
Amid the excited throng only two persons sat unmoved. These
were Prince Egbert and Prince Alfred.
"We are lost." The cry resounded through the room. "Who will
save us from this dreadful plant, that will overrun all the Three
Kingdoms and strangle us all?" yv
"l will do that," said Prince Alfred, "if the King will renew his
promise to give to him who can kill the plant his crown and his
kingdom."
"It is yours, for I am helpless; only kill the plant at once, good
Balthazar." So spoke King Atreus to Alfred.
"I will take your piece of the Black Robe and your crown and
scepter before I do my part of the work," answered Prince Alfred,
"for you might change your mind, as Kings have been known to do
before." . *-â ..â .'-.*.. _â¢ i. J ._ 1_
Alfred took the crown and placed it upon his own head, it having
fallen from the head of King Aliens. Then he took up the scepter
and with his own hands, drew from under the bands that held King
Atreus a prisoner his piece of the Black Robe. This having been
done all the magic that had belonged to King Atreus was his.
Then, at a whispered word, which the magicians tried in vain to
hear Alfred spoke to the vine, which withered as before a fierce fire.
From its withering branches fell its fruit, rich and juicy. There was
enough for a royal feast for all who were in the banquet hall.
"Hail to King Balthazar. Long may he rule as our mightiest
magician." yy :. __ â¢; ;"**. '' . -
The cry filled the palace with noise. Queen Atoll, listening in
her underground dungeon, in the palace of Egbert, ground her teeth
together in helpless rage. But so much had Egbert learned of magic
in the Three Kingdoms that be was in no fear that she would be
able to escape. Filled with joy now was Egbert; proud and happy
was Alfred. The two brothers were Kings of magicians and had
proved themselves to be more powerful than any of the black dwarfs.
But in their moment of triumph, they were still troubled, for they
knew that, until they could find the Lady of the Black Robe and
take her to their father, the good King, the spell would still make
the kingdom unhappy. â -,'- "'--
It was now Egbert's turn to prove his magic. The black dwarfs
watched him eagerly as he began to work his charm.
Soft and sweet music was heard. Louder and louder it grew
until now it was a marchâ the music of the march played whenever
the good King, the father of the Three Princes, had, in the old, happy
days, come home from the wars in victory. What was that? From
the old clock case â from the clock which had not made a sound for
many yearsâ came the voice of a deep-toned bell, beating time to the
music Egbert and Alfred were as much astonished as were the

her naughty 4-year-old son. "All right,
mamma," replied the precocious young
ster, "and after you've whipped me
nestling there was in short time fast
asleep. . . v
"Such a beautiful boy to be wander
ing so," thought she, smoothing the
pretty curls, and then left him with a
sigh.
But the boy wasn't to slumber, as
peacefully as it looked he might. He
had a dream, and such a dream! This
is how he himself told it next morning
to the ferryman's wife:
"Lady, it was so very.very strange,"
he began. "I thought I was with the
ferryman and helped him row such odd
little people across an awful river. The
water rushed onward, continuously on
ward, with mighty motion, and the dis
tant, opposite shore. was dim, always
dim. ' . . *~yy
"The ferryman had grown very old
and white-looking* and his long, thin,
wrinkled hand:; shook with age. He
looked as if hundreds -of years had
passed over his head and so feeble that
I wondered how he managed to row.
But his boat gilded on and on, swiftly
and surely. _*VC Vv^V
"None of his passengers ever spoke
nor smiled nor did they seem to hear
when I spoke to them. Their eyes with
hopeful joy were looking at something
I couldn't see far away. What was it?
I wondered. Could it be that ever, dis
tant opposite shore that they were
watching? I asked this, softly whisper
ing to a little creature beside me, but
my question wasn't heard. I asked it
of each one and not one knew I spoke.
"At last I turned to the old ferryman,
but he was like all the rest and I saw
A REAL UP-TO-DATE CASABIANCA.
THE boy stood on the burning
roof.
In his heart was black despair,
He looked aloft, he looked aloof,
No power could save him there.
And soon around that fearless youth
The firemen aimed a streahi,
But it was useless work forsooth â
The water turned to steam.
Then through the horror-stricken
crowd
A man began to grope;
There's always life, he cried aloud,
Wherever there is soap (hope).
Then" picking up a large-sized cake
He held it up on high;
"Play on that soap for goodness sake,
That poor boy must not die!"
And on that bar of yellow soap
The water soon did gather,
And then the boy with new-born hope
Slid safely down the "lather!"- .
Another time that self-same lad
Stood on the burning deck,
ANNIE NIGHUS.
may I have the whip to play horse
with?" . ..
A bright little girl of 4, who was
watching a balloon ascension, suddenly
exclaimed: "Mamma, I shouldn't think
the Lord would like to have that man
come up to heaven alive."
creeping into his eyes the same far-off
look of hopeful joy and peace. I grew
half afraid, but I must keep my fears to
myself.
"I tried to stop the motion of my oars
to rest my tired arms, but couldn't.
Then I called to the ferryman to stop
his boat, if only for a mi :te, but my
voice didn't sound at all. We just
glided on an on in the sa;_ie unceasing,
never-ending, noiseless way. I noticed
with astonishment that the little crea
tures around me grew more and more
beautiful and their eyes almost dpy.z
me. They- grew so wondrously lovely
that I looked at them in awe, but still
they neither spoke nor smiled. I tried
to take my hand from my oar to touch
one, but this 'me neither would my
hand leave its work. I must always
row, it seemed, but so tired had I now
become I felt nothing but pain, pain.
It made no difference, I must ever con
tinue.
"What would happen, and would this
journey never, never end, I thought
wearily. My h d inside seemed to
whirl, and finally, with great effort, I
awoke. ' y'y X
"Oh, with what joy, lady, did I find
myself in that comfortable bed, and
how glad to be under your roof and
once more awake." He sighed as if
he never could feel relieved enough.
black dwarfs. They knew then that their brother must be in the
clock, ringing the bell. : r' _ I â_.,_.â¢
"I have captured." said Egbert to the dwarfs, suddenly changing
his plan "a son of the good King and have him a prisoner in the
clock case. With my own hands will I bring him forth that he may
be thrown into a dungeon. How I have worked this magic I will not
say; butâ here he is!" 77' _. . , ,
Egbert, saying this, opened the door of the clock case, and out
stepped Arthur. 7 ; \7i' : _. Â
The sons of Atrid drew their swords and would have" fallen upon
Arthur had not Egbert, who had thought out all his plan in an instant,
called to them: . 7-77 _*
' "What ho! Stand back! This man is my prisoner. Let no one
harm him at his peril."
The dwarfs stopped to listen.
"I have a fancy, brother King Atrophole," said Egbert, coolly,
"to teach this foolish man a lesson. He has dared to come into our
kingdoms to seek for the Lady of the Black Robe. Let us turn him
into the wilderness. He mocks us. We will mock him and his father,
the good King, bitterly. Give me your piece of the Black Robe, that
I may work my will. The beasts, seeing him with only a piece of
the Robe, will tear him to pieces."
King Atrophole, not dreaming that there was danger to himself
in what he was about to do, mockingly placed on the form of Arthur
his piece of the Black Robe. *â¢* . 7-7*7.
Now. at last, the Black Robe was all held by the Three Princes.
"Lady of the Black Robe," said Egbert loudly, "I command you
to arise." _ , , .
Before the surprised eyes of all the dwarfs the Lady came into
view.
At that instant there was a noise like thunder at the gate..
The dwarfs opened the gates only to see before them the three
good giants who had been the friends of Alfred in the desert. They
forced their way through the crowd of dwarfs and, bowing low, made
themselves a bodyguard for Arthur, nor did any of the dwarfs dare
to trouble Arthur then. 7' : -Â-_.,_._-__ i
"To the gates. Let us go at once," said the Lady of the Black
Robe to Egbert. - V v
"At once; forward," answered Egbert, Alfred and Arthur in one
breath.
Then the dwarfs for the flrst time knew that the Three Princes
stood before them with the Lady of the Black Robe. Swiftly flew
they to the dungeon of Queen Atoll and struck off the chains that
bad held her so long. d :'-.â¢Â»â¢'â¢ '".-â 
The Three Princes and the Lady of the Black Robe had passed
out through the gates, which were closed behind them.
" "They flee, but shall not yet escape us," screamed AtolL
LIONS OF THE THORNY WAY,
LIONS OF THE DESERT PATH,
LIONS OF MOST AWFUL WRATH,
SEE THREE PRINCES FOR YOUR PREY!
When these words had been spoken scores of fierce lions suddenly
appeared and were running toward the Princes and the Lady when
the Lady of the Black Robe said:
â :."-.-- "Quickly, now. my robe restore. I will make it whole once more."
The Three Princes quickly gave their pieces of the Black Robe to
the Lady and the pieces knit together and the Lady threw her Robe
over her shoulders. Then all her magic was hers once again.
The roaring lions were turned to stone. The black dwarfs dared
not open their gates to pursue. Atoll, pursuing, was changed to a
crocodile and has remained a crocodile ever since.
Soon the Three Princes were in the kingdom of their father once
again. The spell that had troubled the kingdom was removed. Prince
Egbert was married to the Lady of the Black Robe. They reigned
when the King died and had one son, who wasâ Prince I Don't Care.
As I was looking through a trunk full of queer things from Arabia
the other day I found a writing which told me something about the
further adventures of Prince I Don't Care. I will begin to tell you
about them soon, if you wish. D. H. W.
(The End.)
BY EUGENE A. BEAUCE
His outlook now is more than sad,
He'll soon sink with the wreck.
But hope has been renewed again
Just when all hope seemed lost,
And now to him with might and main
A bar of soap is tossed.
The boy for life begins to cope,
He will be saved once more,
For grabbing up that bar of soap
He washed himself ashore.
A Sweet Washday in Candy Town.
But he was too happy and light
hearted to bother much about anything
and when he waved good-by to the
ferryman's wife as she stood at the
cottage gate watching him, it was with
the same bright Joyous face that had
looked in at her dcor the day before.
She followed the boy with eyes full
of longing and regret. She saw him
greeted with glad, loud shouts by some
tiny children in the distance, coming
from she knew not where. He joined
the merry group as if he belonged to
them. Turnln he waved a parting
farewell to the ferryman's wife. She
smiled in - nswer and smiling, sobbed
and tears fell fast and many, showing
how sadly she felt.
"Such a beautiful boy. such a beau
tiful boy," she murmured.
When her eyes cleared enough to see
again they had all disappeared into. the*
deep dark woods.
She stood meditatively for awhile
after he had gone, then gave herself a
little shake. Thoughtfully she drew her
hand across her eyes, saying, ponder
ingly. aloud, "Is this all a dream? Have
I been sleeping or am I awake?"
No answer came and ihe returned
methodically to her work. She never
quite knew what to think of this little
child who came apparently from no
where and wentâ where?

ALGER THE MAN OF THE HOUR.
Continued From Page Eighteen.
the general commanding the division, I
have the honor to submit the following
'report on the case of Colonel R. A. Al
ger, Fifth Michigan Cavalry, stating the
time at which he left the command, for
what purpose, by what authority and his
present whereabouts.'
"Colonel Alger left this command the
morning of August 28, as It marched
through Harper's Ferry to rejoin the di
vision near Halltown. He has been ab
sent since that date. I was not aware
of his absence until this brigade halted
to feed near Halltown, when Assistant
Surgeon St. Clair, of the First Michigan-
Cavalry, Informed me that Colonel Alger,
owing to some Indisposition, had remain
ed at a house in Harper's Ferry. At the
same ' time Assistant Surgeon St. Clair
presented for my approval an application
from Colonel Alger for leave of absence
for twenty days.
"As Colonel Alger had two. or three
times previous to this applied* for a simi
lar leave of absence when ln my opinion
he was fit for duty, and which opinion
subsequently proved to be correct, as -it
has in the case now referred to, - I re
turned Colonel Alger's application with
out my approval. He failed to join his
command. I first heard of him again as
stopping at the Eutaw House- in Balti
more, Md. - 1 now have authentic and re
liable information that he is staying at
one of the hotels in Washington, D. C.
and that he has been placed on duty in
the latter city as a member of a general
court martial. How he came to bo de
tailed* I cannot say.
"He left his command without author
ity, and after having been refused a leave
of absence from. these headquarters, and
I have directed that, he be reported 'ab
sent without leave' on the muster rolls
of his* regiment."
General Merritt . made this indorse
ment: "Respectfully forwarded for the
action of the chief of cavalry. The case
mentioned within Is the third in which
Colonel Alger has absented himself from
the command without proper authority
since the commencement of the present
year's campaign. Severe measures should
be taken to prevent a recurrence of this
evil." â  yyv yy-y â
* And General Torbert said: Respect
fully ' forwarded, with the recommenda
tion that he be dismissed from the serv
ice for absence without leave, subject to
the approval of the President. Such cases
are too numerous, and the scarcity of of
ficers requires immediate action to be
taken." *'*.'/
To this General Sheridan added: "Re
spectfully forwarded. I understand that
Colonel Alger is on some military duty at
Washington, but It Is evident that he has
left his command without authority, and
it appears that he has done so before. I
have always considered Colonel Alger a
good officer, but I cannot excuse his con
duct or withhold my approval to the rec
ommendation of his immediate command
ers." -"
< Irregular Resignation.
Here we see that the very men who had
been his zealous friends in endeavoring to
secure for him promotion had condemned
condemned him regretfully but firm
ly. But Alger was In Washington and
was not idle. He says he was 111, but he
was not too 111 to put such machinery in
motion that his resignation was accepted,
though 11 was very irregularly offeredâ
that Is, not through his Immediate com
manders. They were within a day of.
Washington. He preferred, however, to
get out without any assistance from
them, and so, on September 6, 1864, ' â¢ he'
sent his resignation directly to the Sec
retary of War, giving as his reason for
throwing up his commission the necessity
f or his presence at home. This resigna
tion reached the President and Mr. Lin
coln wrote on it "Let this resignation be
accepted." *- - '-%.." . J ''.â } '
Something appears to have gone wrong,
for nothing more was done with the Al
ger resignation. It may be that Mr. Stan

Hales.
rich confirmation veilings, gloves, ribbons, dress goods: swell Easter novelties now on display!
I self, held it up to see why Alger was In
; such a hurry to put off his uniform and
j the responsibilities of it. At any rate,
j on September 16 Alger filed another res
; ignation, very much in the same terms
!as that of ten days before. This went
j through like a whistle. The same day.
, Mr. Lincoln wrote on it "Let this resig-
I nation be accepted;" the next day Mr.
j Stanton Indorsed it "Accepted," and on
I September 19, 1864, Edward Townsend,
! acting adjutant-general, announced in
j special orders No. 311 that Colonel R. A.
: Alger was "honorably discharged."
' â  Moral and Physical Characteristics.
And so he who to-day is the head of the
j War Department, civil commander of the
army, and the man of the hour, by a
! short cut got ahead of the greatest cav
alrymen ln the. service and escaped the
punishment they thought he merited.
. In thus' running away from the conse
quences of his own acts Alger showed
early in his career a characteristic which
j has marked it all the way through. He
has a short-lived physical courage and no
moral courage whatever. In action he is
a physical Dr. Jekyll: in office he is a
moral Mr. Hyde. This disposition toward
moral cowardice is best shown by his ex
planation of his military record when that
was brought forth as a bar to his politi
cal ambition. â¢ V*7*
He who. had resigned in irregular fash
ion said he never dreamed that there was
anything against, him in his record.
Probably he did not know that in the de
partment he now presides over all the
official documents are preserved. When he
did learn it he placed all the, blame on
Custerâ Custer and his broother Tom, two
gallant officers who fell in the battle of
the Little Rosebud in 1876. yy':
Custer, Fays Alger, wanted Alger to se
cure for Tom Custer a lieutenancy in Al
ger's regiment, so that Tom Custer might
serve on his brother's staff. The virtu
ous Alger declined, and so Custer, to get
even, sent in the reports which Merritt.
Torbert and Sheridan indorsed. Had
they also asked favors of Alger? Tom
Custer, it must be said, was one of the
most gallant of the ; young men in the
army. Nothing so added to the disgust
that army officers felt for the man who
Is now Secretary of "War as this dragging

loved as his brother was admired. -\\ . ty
Business Life.
Colonel Alpcr went to . his home in
Grand : Rapids when he . had . finished his
business with the War Department in 15..4,
and presumably he settled up satisfac
torily the business which: made him anx
ious. , lie* stayed In that \ town- till 1867.
when he moved' to Detroit, where, the
firm of Moore & Alger, dealers in pine
lands, was organized. : Dater this was
changed to Alger, Smith & Co., and. If I
mistake not, this firm still exists. . These
firms engaged in the buying and selling
of . timber lands on their own account
rather than for clients, and were success
ful, becoming rich. ,~. 7 7:7*
- Colonel' Alger, brevetted . brigadier gen
eral when the war was over and' brevets
were given to all who asked for them,
began to be -looked- upon twenty years
and more ago as a rich _ man, and early
became; a personage" in the business life
of Detroit. He joined the Grand Army of
the Republic when that body was:organ
ized, and after -'he ' had entered politics
became the national commander. He has
been an* active , member"' always, ; and
speaks at the camp fires on every oppor
tunity. At these camp fires, by the way.
he has the reputation of making the most
inane and platitudinous speeches of any
comrade who is permitted to speak. But
then lt must be remembered that we will
tolerate in a millionaire what we will
stand from no other kind of bore.

with great regularity. In his family life
he is, I am told, everything that is ad
mirable. He may not be very entertain
ing, to be sure, for he lacks the sense of
humor; but he has been a good provider,
to use a homely and honest old expres
sion, and his nature Is affectionate and
kindly. He lacks polish both in manner
and speech, but in our rough and ready
society we forgive a man such shortcom
ings with much readiness. In his family
life he Is rather commonplace and unin
teresting, which is greatly to his credit.
He has not intruded this on the public,
and the public has no right to invade his
privacy. " .7' .
But with his business and political life
it is different. As a politician he ; has
achieved what distinction has come to
him by reason of his business success;
and his business success has been mainly
due to short cuts, cuts short and sharp,
like that he took when he got his resigna
tion from the army accepted. For in
stance, here is a specimen:
A Little Speculation.
In IRS3 he. and his associates were the
owners of large tracts of pine lands. It
would be a fine thing to cut the timber
off this great area provided it could bo
brought to a good market. A railroad
was needed. But a railroad costs a lot
of money, and when the forest was cut
from this area of Alger lands the railway
would no longer pay, as agriculturally
the territory was almost valueless. The
thing to do was to get some one to build
the road or rather supply the money. Now,
no sane railroad man would go Into the
venture for. the ordinary traffic of the road,
so it was evident that the thing to do was
to get the money from those who did not
understand the situation. The freight
from the proposed road would be taken
to the Michigan Central, so that com
pany was interested in the road to the
extent of the freight while the timber
was being moved.
So General Alger evolved this scheme.
So long as the forest cutting was going
on the road would pay. â¢ That was evi
dent, and the period was fixedâ say It was
five or -ten years. But any one can look
It up In Poor's Manual. With this Idea
General Alger got Mr. Ledyard, president
of the Michigan Central,, to guarantee the
coupons of the bonds' for the period,
whatever it was, agreed upon. This made
the bonds absolutely good for that pe
riod. They were sold in New York, one,
and it may be more than one, life in
surance company purchasing a large
block.
During the gathering and marketing of
the timber everything was lovelyâ the
road made money and the coupons were
regularly paid up to and beyond the.ex
piration of the guarantee by the Michi
gan Central- In 1892 ' the outstanding 6
per cent bonds of the Detroit, Bay City
and Alpena Railroad were $2,500,000. ,' Gen
eral Alger was president, and on the di
rectory with him were Messrs. T. H. New
berry. James McMillan, Hugh McMillan,
M. S. Smith and J. C. McCaul, all of De
troit. -. - â "â¢77.. .â  . - -
% In July, 1893, the road defaulted on its
bonds and Don M. Dickinson was ap
pointed receiver in October. The road
was sold under foreclosure on November
8, 1894. It has since been reorganized as
the Detroit and Mackinac Railroad. ..*'.* Mr.
Hawks of Detroit is president, and Mr.
Edward ;N.-Gibbs of New York is in the
directory. It has a capital stock of $2,075,
--000 and a funded debt of $2,918,000.
' That, must -have* been a very profitable
enterprise for Alger and his associates.
The particular -.life .insurance company
changed its "management subsequent to
this very profitable' investment In- the
bonds of the Detroit", Bay City & Alpena
Railroad. But General Alger got his lum
ber to market and Mr. Ledyard carried
the freight.
Rich. Man in Politics.
In such wily ways Alger became rich
and has long been counted a millionaire.
Millionaires have their uses in politics,
and so Alger was enlisted actively in
the cause of Republicanism, in which he
had always been Interested, because pos
Hales.
sibly of natural bent and perhaps some
what by reason of the protection to his
lumber from Canada competition. He
was sent as a delegate to the National
Convention at Chicago in 1884, and he is
said to have liked the experience im
mensely. So when he got back home he
accepted the Republican nomination for
Governor, and was elected by 3.953 votes.
He served only one term, but the Presi
dential bee took permanent lodgment in
his bonnet. It was put there by wily ad
venturers such as Kellogg of Louisiana
and Clayton of Arkansas. These Republi
cans in the South need a man with a
barrel. They cannot keep their negro
supporters together without money. /
So Alger got the Presidential bee in his
bonnet, and he has been a more or less
ridiculous figure ever since, despoiled by
the political adventurers and laughed at
by the politicians who were really in con
trol. At the convention of 1888 he went
there with the support of his State and
was supposed to have a really substantial
boom. On the sixth ballot he had 143
votes, having secured votes from the
dusky delegates of the South. â¢ .
* This was a serious disarrangement of
John Sherman's plans. Indeed, Sherman,
in his book, had this to say of it:
Buying Sherman's Votes.
"I believe and had, as I thought, con
clusive proof that the friends of General
Alger substantially purchased the votes
of many of the delegates from the
Southern States who had been Instructed
by their conventions to vote for me.
"There were eight ballots taken in the
convention, in all of which I had a- large
plurality of 'votes until the last one."
(Harrison was not considered party to
any deal.)
"The only feeling of resentment I en
tertained was in regard to the action of
the friends of --General Alger ln tempting
with money poor negroes to violate the
instructions of their constituents."
Some others took Alger's interference
more gayly. For instance, this colloquy
was reported as having taken place be
tween Butterworth of Ohio and Palmer of
Michigan just after the convention:
Butterworthâ lt was a mean thing.
Palmer, to buy our niggers away from us.
Palmerâ Well, we bought 'em first.
When General Harrison was elected Al
ger sought to go Into his Cabinet, but
Harrison made him no offer. It was
freely hinted when McKinley. was seeking
the nomination that Alger's experience in
getting delegates In the. South was used
by ' Hanna; and when Alger was invited
to a place in the Cabinet there was a sus
picion that Alger helped with something
more substantial than experience. The
experiences of the last year lead many to
believe that the obligations to Alger are
very heavy/ else he would not be re
tained. .-. yyyyi
â¢' It is quite impossible to believe that
McKinley would have selected Alger for
War Secretary had be expected that we
should have war. He was unfitted for
the" duty *in even* way. He* has really
had little administrative experience. His
fortune was accumulated, by speculation,
and not in ordinary business. His short
term as Governor of Michigan was really
about all *. the . administrative experience
he ever had. Then he was oldâ not old
in years, but actually old, for time had
used him hardlyâ and he was out of
health. He was quite unfit for the larger
duties to which he was called.
In his manner of conducting business
he has two methods. One is to be agree
able. When he has this fit he is apolo
getic rather than genial. The other is
when he means to be commanding. Then
he is merely rudely truculent. At either
time he impresses you with the fact that
he is a weak man who would be con
sidered strong, and that he is least of
all a gentleman.
Such was the man who was placed at
the head of an army the officers of which
despised him. With the prejudice against
him. with his lack of experience, with
his weak vanity and with his broken
health, he fell an easy victim to War De
partment politics, and thereafter, except
when he surprised himself with a silly
squeak, such as his Roosevelt letter, he
never knew that his name was his own.
