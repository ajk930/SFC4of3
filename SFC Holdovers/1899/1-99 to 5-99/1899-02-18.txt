movement, and that he is in favor
of a complete cleaning out of the
Dreyfus. question. This fits in so
well with the. alleged sentiments
of Prince Victor and his brother,
Louis, in : favor of Dreyfus re

some forthcoming action on the
part of the Princes is increased,
and the secret encouragement of

STRANGELY DISAPPEARS

Accounts and Make Some

Startling Discoveries.
The Hills of the Army Reservation Searched in Vain
for the Missing Man His Friends Fear That
Suicide Followed Disgrace.
First Lieutenant John M. Neall, one !
of the most popular and widely known
regular army officers stationed at the
Presidio, is missing and his friends are
excited by the gravest fears. The lieu
tenant was last seen on Wednesday,
and although the most thorough search
has been made for him he cannot bo
found. Certain facts in connection with
his disappearance have given cause for
the suspicion that he has made away
with himself and that his dead body is
hidden somewhere on the Presidio
reservation.
On the afternoon "of the day of his
disappearance Lieutenant Neall should
have reported to his superiors. His
failure to do so led to the inquiry. It
was rumored that the officer had been
playing cards heavily of late and his
accounts at the reservation were ex
amined. The result was a discovery
that startled the friends and associates
of the missing man. The investigators
have reported that Lieutenant Neall is
short in his accounts, but to what ex
tent has not yet been ascertained. It
is believed that the amount is at least
$5000. â¢ .-P--
The affair has created a sensation at
the Presidio . and at the local clubs
where Lieutenant . Neall . was a frequent
and welcome visitor. For several years I
the missing lieutenant has been secre- I
tary and treasurer of the Presidio Club. j
He was also canteen ; officer of the
reservation. In both i capacities he |
handled large sums of 'money and, so |
far as any of his friends knew, fulfilled
his trust honorably. As secretary and
treasurer of the Presidio Club Lieuten
ar' Neali h .. kecv&fc .he fUTffis
contributed by the r officers l of the reser- l
ration. As canteen officer the ' missing |
man had charge of the receipts which
accumulated from r the dally purchases
of the men Of the reservation. An in
vestigation'of -both accounts, as far as,
it has progressed, shows, it is claimed,
that $1000 of the. funds of the Presidio
Club and about $4000 of the money of
the canteen are missing. It is expected
that the 7 inquiry will be concluded to
day, when the result will be submitted
to General Shafter.
The disappearance and disgrace of
Lieutenant Neall have. shocked all. who j
knew him, and he was known to many. !
He is a Californian and was' graduated I
from West Point- in 1883 as a second
lieutenant. He was assigned to "Troop
B of the Fourth United States Cavalry.
Throughout all his service in the Fe- j
eral army he remained with this troop
and in 1890 was promoted to the rank of
first lieutenant. His service brought
him to the frontier and he distinguished
himself early as a most competent offi
cer of exceptional bravery. For many
years he was in the field with General
Miles, whose commendation he earned.
During his stay at the Presidio Lieu
tenant Neall made himself a general fa
vorite with officers and men. Lieuten
ant "Jack's" word was more than a
command where a command is law to
those who hear . it. He tempered dis
cipline with 'courtesy; to the meanest
private within the range of his author
ity. That is one reason why the Pre
sidio hills have been searched for two
days since the moment it was reported
that Lieutenant Jack Neall was re
ported missing, and the suspicion of his
closest friends was authority for the'
fear that he had taken his own life.
In other than military circles. Lieu
tenant Neall was also : a.' universal " fa
vorite. He was a familiar figure at the
Bohemian arid. University,- clubs, and if
he handled the cards too often and lost
too frequently his friends shrugged
their shoulders and said that he could
afford 1 to do so. He rarely gambled. at
the reservation | and no one i suspected
that his losses elsewhere were material.
This was Lieutenant "Jack" as his
friends knew him. , But last Wednesday
night another phase of: his character
was revealed and those who 1 ' heard the
story of it were pained and,' shocked
rather than indignant. .;â  -
Lieutenant Neall did- not report to
his superiors as it was his. duty to do.
He had neither a leave of absence nor
an excuse from service. He knew quite
as well as his superiors the penalty for
his absence. '.His own rigid regard for
discipline made his superior officers
immediately suspicious that something
of . a serious nature had happened to
him. , : . ; '\ -."; '. ';': â ;' v
Inquiry was at . once made at his
home, but he was not ~ there, and his
distracted wife i could give no explana
tion for his disappearance. He had. been
seen on the â¢ reservation during the
afternoon,' but no one' could : tell where
he had gone.; He had 'seemed ; to be in
his .usual mood, but his neglect of duty
was proof that something -was seriously
wrong. A search of j the | Presidio, hills
was made, but : the missing lieutenant
could not be found. Inquiry was] made
at downtown clubs and at places that
Lieutenant ; Neall - frequented, but ? the
inquiries were fruitless. '.; : ,\ %\ X V -.' ..'_-.
'-/An.- investigation I.'1 .' of Lieutenant
Neall's | books | was | then' '-.under
the orders of Colonel Charles E. Como
ton.'This investigation has revealed
the fact that $4000 which was on deposit
:In a \ local Â§ bank to the | credit of the
Presidio * canteen - has been * drawn out
and the officers and men. of the reser
vation are that much poorer.
Lieutenant Neall has been canteen,
officer of the Presidio for about two
months. The general belief in his
probity and his popularity won him the
position. As canteen officer he had ab
solute control of canteen funds, and as
such officer he appropriated the funds.
This unexpected discovery was ' fol
lowed by another equally- as startling.
The books of the Presidio Club were
examined and the investigators found
that Lieutenant Neall's accounts
showed a discrepancy of approximately
$1000. This is why the friends of Lieu
tenant Neall believe that they will not
see him again until they attend his
funeral and the Presidio has the record
of another tragedy as sad as that of
Colonel Upton.
MISSING FROM HIS
HOME IN SAN JOSE
Friends of Remain Lassere Fear He
Has Been Foully Dealt
With.
SAN JOSE, Feb. Remain Lassere,
who for the past fifteen years has been
employed as bookkeeper for Victor
Cauhape, the wholesale butcher, has mys
teriously disappeared. His friends and
family fear he has been- foully
dealt with. On Sunday morning Lassere
left; his home on South Eleventh . street,
near Margaret, to go to South; San Fran
cisco to. see about purchasing some, cat
tle. â¢; He took the. 4:3o train. The conduc
tor remembers having seen him. but after
this all trace. of him was lost. ,He intend
ed fo rptaijn. the same evening. ;
Lassere had left Cauhape's employment
the night before, intending to go into the
butcher business on his own account: At
that time he turned over $1400 to the new
bookkeeper, which was., the collections of
the day. â  His books are, straight, and
Cauhape says he cannot account for Las
sere's disappearance. Lassere has a wife
and child,- and his home life was particu
larly happy. The missing man was both
brother-in-law and nephew of Cauhape.
He possessed property and money. Lassere
was very punctual in his habits, and
neither drank nor gambled.
Lassere is 35 years of age. 5 feet 7 inches
tall and ' weighs about 130 . pounds. He'
carried considerable money with him. and
it is feared he has been foully dealt with
or met with some accident. His friends
are making a diligent search for him,
and police of the various cities have been
notified. - â¢ .

, CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 17.â The way of the
transgressor is hard. Poor old Senator
Simpson slept and wept all afternoon
in his seat in the Senate chamber. Be
fore' sundown he was carried by two
touts to his room at 611 X street.
His condition was pitiable in the ex
treme. Before he was completely over
come he opened and read' mapy tele
grams from his former friends in Los
Angeles County. The rebukes admin
istered must have been scathing arid
racking, as he' destroyed many of the
telegrams without permitting his fam
ily to perceive their contents. At mid
night his condition was deplorable if
not critical. Attendants were at his
bedside to 'do whatever could be done
to mitigate the physical . and mental
distress of the disgraced and suffer
ing man. It would be no surprise if. a
complete collapse of the Senator should
follow. Physicians and nurses may
be able to get him on his feet again,
but. his usefulness In public and pro
fessional life is at an end.
To-night in every Senatorial camp
other than the corral. of touts there are
words of contempt and censure .for the
methods employed by "Burns to aug
ment his .'strength.' It is regarded as
shameful that Burns should have taken
advantages of the infirmities of a weak
old . I man to induce him teff Betray" his"
neighbors and forfeit the respect of his
associates. - ; The history of the \ Wright
case" is ; repeated, ; and Burns ! has weak
ened ; rather than strengthened his
cause by the employment- of heartless
measures to bring men into line. When
the protest was lodged against the ex
treme cruelty of forcing Wright into
the corral Burns exclaimed:..
"The vote belongs to me and I will
have it." .
In the Simpson case the vote did not
belong to . L. rns. It 'belonged to a
Southern California candidate, and the
method employed by the touts to get
it were no more creditable t:.an the act
of ."rolling" a drunk and robbing him.
Burns has fallen several degrees in the
estimation of the reputable members
of the -Legislature since he accom
plished the undoing of Simpson. ' In the
minds of decent and respectable Sena
tors and Assemblymen there is a sen
timent that such measures as Burns
employed to win the vote of Simpson
are degrading, and should be rebuked

The silliest and. most, absurd '.fake
story of the campaign was published
this evening in 'the subsidized ? San

to-be a report of a conversation with

credited, with ' expressions .commenda

that the whole story was false from be

that every "~ meeting ,or . conference â' re

The purpose to defeat Dan Burns and
avert disgrace "to the "State grows
stronger .every hour.- It is clearly com
prehended that Burns cannot win with
out a caucus, and- in order to make sure
of his defeat.-a secret caucus, is resisted.

THE NEW LIBRARIAN
JAMES L. GILLIS.
R * CALL HEADQUARTERS', SACRAMENTO. Feb. 17. -The State Librarian
-'Q ,to succeed' Frank " L. Coombs will be James L. Gillis. There were several
i? candidates for the. position when the trustees selected Mr. Coombs, and
<"& among, others was Mr. Gillis. He was an active worker to bring about the
. *3 election of the present board of library, trustees, and when the board was
Â§ elected by the Legislature two years ago it was thought that Gillts had
, 'ft won his fight for the place. A : -"
8 Mr.. Coombs was recently appointed United States Attorney for the
Â« Northern District of California,' but will not take charge of the office before
'Â°,'BS..the first day of March,, although he. will be entitled to take possession on
O tho'2oth inst. When he surrenders his office as State Librarian on March 1
.15 he will' be succeeded by Mr. Gillis.
S There. was seme talk of Frank D. Ryan to succeed Mr. Coombs, but his
Â« friends, after considering the question in all its bearings, came to the con
ga elusion that it would not be proper for the Board of Trustees to elect one
ft of its own members to the position of Librarian. The board will meet either
SS In this city or San Francisco before the first of next month to fill the vacancy
ÂÂ£ and J. L. Gillis will be elected to succeed Mr. Coombs. '
men stood firm and the Grant. column
.was solid.'. Poor old Simpson is all that
â¢Burns can show for a month's work,
with the- assistance of the Republican
State Executive Committee, the South
ern-Pacific support and the influence of
| the- Mose Gunst gambling fraternity.
.- The touts are circulating, a rumor
i .that when General Barnes goes to San
! Francisco to-morrow' he will not return
to Sacramento," but will' stay away and
leave: his. eleven supporters in the air.
Such a statement was made to Assem
blyman Knights to-day. .There is. not
a-: particle- of. truth- on . which to base
such' an assertion. General Barnes will
I return .f rom -. San ' Francisco Sunday
evening and will stay in this Senatorial
contest until trie finish. His chances of
success were never as bright as they
are. to-day." ..Many of â¢ the ablest poli
ticians of . the State. regard him as the
logical - candidate whose' election can be
'accomplished without disrupting the
Republican party. . .
The' fact . is â¢ accepted by the best
judges that Burns cannot get a caucus,
and. without. a caucus' cannot win. The
determination of the Grant men to re
main firm; and immovable as long as
Burns is a candidate grows stronger
every, hour.- .Burns could not be elected
if all -the' Bulla men should enter the
.Caridelarla corral. As long as Grant re
mains in. the field- Burns cannot get
near the winning mark and the Grant
men .believe "they are in a position to
'save the State from lasting disgrace by
standing between Dan Burns and the
United. States Senate. The supporters
of Grant are commended for this exhi
bition of loyalty to California.
Herrin's independent agents, who
have been here this week, will probably
file their reports to-morrow at the same
! time that Dan files his weekly sum-
I mary of operations at the Legislature.
In view of the capture of the Pasadena \
I derelict the Southern Pacific may grant

SENATE AFRAID OF
WORKS' CARTOON BILL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 17.â The Senate Is not anx
ious to consider young Mr. Works' legis
lative child, his bill for the protection of
the be-featured. It has the same desire to '
go at it- as the moth has for investigat
ing the candle flame, but the Senate
knows it may be burned. Still it dallies
with the measure and tosses it from one .
place on the file to another and from one :
day to' another. It has twice been
passed on the file, and now it is over j
again until Monday.
It was suggested to have the matter j
put on the file for this evening's session,
but the Senators wanted a full house ;
present, so to-morrow was suggested.
Then it was remembered that to-morrow
might not do either for the same reason, :
it being Saturday, so Monday was finally j
decided upon. â _, , *
In the meantime young Mr. Works and ;
the honorable Mr. Wright come into the i
Senate chamber every time the bill ap- !
proaches consideration, and having each
secured the ear of some unsuspecting i
Senator they talk for the measure and
show what a blessing it will be for man
kind if the Senators will only vote. aye.
It remains to oe seen what good they
have done by depriving the Assembly of
their legislative powers.

GREENWELL WILL CHANGE
FROM GRANT TO BARD
Ventura's Assemblyman Will Abandon the San Diegan
To-Day at the Request of His Constituents.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRAMENTO, Feb. 17.â Assemblyman C. B. Greenwell will change his vote
to-morrow from U. S. Grant to Thomas R. Bard. This will be the beginning of what Mr.- Bard's friends hope
will be a Senatorial landslide. It is known that several of Mr. Grant's supporters are pledged to vote for Bard
as their second choice candidate, and the fact that Greenwell intends to leave the San Diegan at this time
may be significant. Mr. Greenwell has been confined to his bed for several days with an attack of grip, but
he expects to be able to attend the joint session to-morrow. -'
"I think I will be able to get to the Capitol to-morrow," he said to-night, "and if I am, I will cast my
vote for Thomas R. Bard for United States Senator. I would have left Mr. Grant several days ago had I
been able to attend the sessions and cast my vote. I do not know whether Mr. Bard will be credited with
an- other gain than that of my vote, but I hope he will. If Mr. Grant's supporters would go to Bard he would
be elected Senator, for he is a man who Is in every way fitted for the place, and to whom every Republican in
the State could conscientiously give support." â  . '' â¢
VENTURA Feb 17 â E. S. Hall, chairman of the Republican County Central Committee, has issued a call
for a meeting to be held in the Town Hall to-morrow afternoon, at 2 o'clock. It is generally understood that
the purpose of this meeting is to adopt a resolution concerning the Senatorial contest. It is highly probable
that Assemblyman Greenwell will be Instructed to change his vote from Grant to Thomas R. Bard of Hueneme.
POOLSELLINE
DISCUSSED BY
THE SENATORS
Consideration of the
Braunhart Bill.
ALL AMENDMENTS DEFEATED
GOES OVER TO MONDAY, WHEN
A VOTE WILL BE TAKEN.
Prohibits the Selling of Pools Any
where but on Race Tracks, and
Limits It There to Thirty .
Days a Year.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 17.â This was poolsellers'
day before the Senate, and it was a day
of alternating clouds and sunshine. Sen
ator' Braunhart's bill to restrict poolsell
ing came up for final passage, fought its
way through the morning session until
the Senate had to adjourn for the joint
ballot at noon. The last of a half-dozen
amendments had just been voted down,
and still the bill held its own. The bill
provides that : there shall be no poolselling
anywhere in the State except at a race
track, and then not to exceed thirty days
in a year In any county.\There are other
things which it prohibits, but they are
already in the gambling statute, and were
merely copied into the bill, all but "hokey
pokey."
Upon close inspection of the .statute
Senator Bulla found that the word "hokey
pokey" had been omitted from the bill, and
he gravely arose to amend by adding the
word "hokey-pokey." He was asked to ex
plain, but he declined on the ground of
Ignorance and innocence, and then the
Senate voted down the amendment.
Senator Braunhart raked the poolrooms
over and over, and when he rose to speak
in support of his measure he had to fight
against the adverse report of the Commit
tee on Public Morals, to which it had been
referred, and to have time enough he se
lected the bill for his place on the urgency
file which was under consideration to-day.
Braunhart declared he cared nothing for
the report of the Committee on Public
Morals, for he said he knew well what in
fluences had been brought to bear there,
a statement which afterward brought
Leavitt to his feet with the remark that
Braunhart was not responsible. Braun
hart replied by saying that Leavitt would
not be favoring the bill if he had not the
programme concession at the Oakland
track. Then the gavel drowned further
words. : -^" â¢ , ,'.
Senator Ashe was first in with an
amendment. He wanted to strike oof.u f . that
part of the act which included the pool
sellers and all his clients and employes.
Ashe explained that be was in favor of
restricting racing; there was too much of
it altogether, he thought; but he believed
it would kill racing if betting was stopped.
It was unconstitutional, he declared, to
allow pool selling at the race track and
prohibit it elsewhere, and, besides, he
said he was opposed to that class of leg
islation.
Senator Jones, who seldom rises to
speak, grew sufficiently enthusiastic to
warn the Senate against fostering any
thing that would "injure any man or his
son. Braunhart declared he would will
ingly accept an amendment prohibiting
poll selling on tracks, too, If some Sena
tor would Introduce it, but nobody would.
Then Leavitt called on the Senate to beat
all the amendments and then beat the bill,
an appeal which brought Senator Short
ridge in evidence.
Shortridge wanted to strike out the en
acting clause, but he was declared out of
order. Then he pronounced all such leg
islation nonsense, declared that private
business and the regulation of private
affairs was no concern of the Senate and
he objected to meddling.
The amendment was voted upon and de
feated. It was at this time that Bulla
discovered his . "hokey-pokey" bug, and
vainly submitted his amendment supply
ing the unfortunate deficiency. Cutter
wanted to know something about "hokey
pokey" and Dickinson suggested it might
have some relation to "keno," but it was
plain the Senators had not run against
the. game. â â¢ ' â¢â¢â¢'-'
Senator Rowell moved to strike out that
portion which exempts race tracks from
the prohibition clause, saying if poolsell
ing Is bad anywhere it is equally so
everywhere. ' Gillette supported him and
Curtin seemed to favor a general prohi
bition or none, but the amendment fol
lowed its predecessors. Then Ashe tried
again by adding a little to Powell's pre
vious amendment. His effort was voted
down. Stratton moved to add a few
words allowing poolselling on "Fabiola
day" in Oakland, but again the noes had
'It. "! Â..'>-' â  :
Curtin submitted an amendment allow
ing sixty days' racing, instead of thirty.
It was a new tack and the Senate rose to
the bait. Leavitt, however,, declared if
racing was bad it should be stopped alto
gether, but - Boyce saw the claw in the
catspaw and said it was right and proper
to begin by degrees, and when he found
the enemy opposing anything he believed
it was good. . Ashe favored the amend
ment, but Jones grew 'voluble again, and
said it would only give more time for
harm. He thought harm enough could
be done in thirty days.
, Wolfe wanted the time extended even
beyond sixty days, for he said under tnat
I limit it i would not pay Eastern men to
I bring their horses out here.
Braunhart offered an amendment to the
1 amendment making it forty-five daya in
! stead of sixty. It was lost. Then the
: sixty day amendment was voted on and
lost. It ; was 12 o'clock and the Senate
! had , to adjourn for the Joint ballot, ;so
I Braunhart's bill, still unamended, was
I laid aside. In the afternoon it was taken
{ up again, only to be laid over until Mon
day, when the Senate will have another
go 'at" it. " Â£'â¢'â '_'",_
There was hardly a Senator who had
not something to say about the bill, and
those who did not talk worked for or
against the measure on the floor. Bett
man led the opposition on the floor. He
voted and worked against the bill In com
mittee and is keeping up the fight in trie
Senate. There are others working for it.
and altogether Braunhart has supplied
food for legislation for some time. â 
There are four sections to the bill, and
the Senate is not yet through with the
first. â¢ â  _'

NEWSPAPER CLAIMS TO
BE TAKEN INTO COURT
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 17.â The Assembly Commit
tee on Ways and Means and the Senate
Committee on Finance met In joint ses
sion to-night to consider the grist of
newspaper claims that has come in for
the publishing of the constitutional
amendments at the last election. Since
Governor Gage repudiated the contracts
that were entered into In good faith by
Governor Budd each day in both houses
has seen a flood of claims come in for
enactment and they have all been re
ferred |o the committees mentioned. H,'
To-night the committee decided to seg
regate the claims authorized by Gover
nor Budd from those not so authorized
and give them first consideration. It fur
ther announced that it would probably
scale all the claims down to a large ex
tent whether they were authorized or not.
â  In reply to this rather remarkable and
arbitrary proposition a representative of
The Call stated that The Call would ac
cept the full amount of Its claim' or noth
ing. He said that either the claim was
legal or it was not. Cutting it down from
the regular rate charged would certainly
not legalize It. If it was illegal, then
The Call did not want a penny of it, but
if It was it wanted the full amount, or
It would take the privilege of testing in
the courts whether legitimate and author
ized claims against the State could be ar
bitrarily scaled. He finished by asking a*
a favor that the committee recommend
that the bill be not passed.
From a representative of the Examiner
It is learned that that journal will take
the same course, and will decline to ac
cept any but the amount charged in its
authorized claim, and It is understood
that other of the large dailies of the State
will pursue the same course.
The committee will meet again to
morrow or Monday evening to resume the
consideration of the accounts before it.

BITTER FIGHT
AGAINST THE
FENDER HILL
Powerful Lobby Led
by Vining.
MAGNATES AT THE CAPITAL
MARKET-STREET MANAGER AND
BRAUNHART .DISAGREE.
The Senator's Measure Denounced as
a "Cinch" of the First Order.
Adverse Report of the
Assembly Committee.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 17.â E. P. Vlnlng, manager I
of the Market Street Railway system, this
evening accused Senator Braunhart of
having introduced Senate bill 72,, the
"fender bill," for the sole purpose of forc
ing the Market street people and other
railroad corporations to "put up." Mr. j
Braunhart, in turn,, accused Mr. Vining i
of having circulated a printed statement j
to the effect that the two-and-a-half-cent .
fare bill, ; introduced by him two years j
ago, was a cinch" bill. ' Mr.- Vining modest- |
ly confessed*-' that this was so and Senator j
Braunhart waxed angry. . J '. ':.'â " .*.'
Incidentally the Assembly committee on
corporations, before which this edifying
squabble took place; reported the bill back
to the Assembly with the recommenda
tion that it do not pass.
No matter for what purpose or with
what bright hopes Braunhart really of
fered the bill, it has resulted in the gath- :
ering here of a powerful lobby. Mr. Vin
ing sent none of his minions nor an at
torney; he came himself to tell how it is
that people get in front of his cars and
are of a consequence killed, and of the
virtuous intention of his company to equip
in time all of Its cars with life-saving
fenders.
The San Mateo and San Francisco line
was represented by its secretary,' Willlarii
Clayton; the Oakland, San Leandro and
Haywards line by its vice president and
secretary, William J. Landers and S. B.
McLanigan, and the San Jose and Santa
Clara road by J. P. Burke.
. The bill which these men have come .up
here to defeat is in effect as follows:
"No person, company â¢ or corpora
tion operating cars â¢on the streets '
of cities or towns, or on the
county roads within the State, for
the conveyance of passengers, propeUed
by means of wire ropes attached to sta
tionary engines, or by electricity or com
pressed air, shall run, operate or use any
car or dummy unless each car and
dummy, while in use, shall have a suit
able fender or appliance placed In front
or attached to the trucks of such dummy
or car, for the purpose of removing and
clearing obstructions from the track and
preventing any obstacles, obstructions or
person - on the track- from getting under
said dummy or car and remove the same
out of danger and out of the way of said
dummy or car. And no person, company
or corporation operating cars on the streets
of cities or towns or on the county roads
within the State for the conveyance of
passengers shall run. operate or use any
such car unless each car, while in use,
shall be fitted with a brake capable of
bringing such car to a stop within a rea
sonable distance." . v : â â â .
The exception taken to it by the trans
portation people is that it is vague in its
Intent and its requirements. In speaking
of this Mr. Clayton said;
"My first objection to Senate bill 72 Is
that it is so vague and at the same time
so arbitrary in some of its conditions that
I do not believe it possible for any rail
road to comply with It. The bill practi
cally states that all street railway cars
must have a fender which will prevent
the â¢ Wheels from injuring â¢ a person who
may be struck by a car. Our failure to
provide a fender as called for by this bill
could, under a statute, be very unfairly
construed -as negligence upon our part.
Take a supposititious case: A boy plays
ball in the street. He runs suddenly â¢ in.
front of the car, eight or ten feet away,
trips, falls flat and In such a position as
to make it impossible for the fender to
pick him up. He Is run over :by the car.
Both his legs are crushed and subsequent
ly amputated. He recovers, but. is crip
pled for life. If we had a fender on the
car that fulfilled the conditions imposed !
by that statute, which it especially states
shall be of a character suitable to prevent
the car from running over a person, most
certainly the boy would not have lost his
legs. Consequently, our failure to provide
such a fender is negligence and it is due
to that negligence on our part that the
boy's legs were cut off."
Mr. Vlnlng said practically the same
thing. He said that no fender had yet
been invented that would in every case
protect a person from being ground under
the wheels; that his - company was . con
stantly experimenting and spending
money in trying to find a fender that
would. There is the strongest incentive,
he said, for every company to .put life
saving fenders on its cars, from" the fact
that they, would save thousands of dollars
each year In' damage suits. *<
Besides all this, Mr. Vining asserted
that not one of the scores of unfortu
nates who have been sacrificed on his road
was killed by the negligence of the com
pany. "Not one person who has been
killed," he said, "was in possession. of all
his faculties. They l were all infirm in
some particular. . They either had fits in
front of the cars, or , were , crippled, â¢ or
blind, or drunk, or had bad teeth, or were
otherwise rendered liable to being run
into and over by a car going at full
speed." /â¢ â¢â -. _ â¢'â¢.' 'â¢â -â .â  "-''
Senator Braunhart came down from the
Senate, which i was in ! evening session up
stairs, to put in a -counter argument," but
his,, dislike for Wining, ; engendered â¢ two
, years ago, got the upper hand I and. he
; turned on the Market street magnate and
accused him of having circulated in the

If every map could live an out-dob: | life,
passing his time with gun and fishinr-rod
and canoe, there would be less Ulnealin-
the world. Unfortunately, the demands of
modern civilization will permit Very iew
men to live this ideal, healthful life.. .' \
Many men have to pass the day shut to
in offices and stores, and the nights in clos?
apartments in crowded cities. They gel
little out-door exercise.. One of the results,
of this unhealthy, sedentary living is the
awful prevalence of that dread disease â
consumption. One-sixth "of all the deaths
each year are due to this relentless enemy.
Formerly' physicians .pronounced this dis-
ease incurable.' It is now. generally known
that there is a marvelous medicine that for
the past thirty years has been curing con- -
sumption almost without a failure. It is
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery. It
Cures 98 per cent, of all cases of consump-
tion, -bronchitis, asthma, laryngitis and
other diseases of the air-passages, it is the
great re-builder. It tears down, carries off
and excretes old, inert tissues and replaces
them with the firm tissues of health. It
restores the lost appetite and makes the
digestion perfect. .'
' " Four years ago I had an attack of grip that
left my throit and lungs in a bad condition,"
â  writes Mrs. Mary Hartman, of 300 Harker St.,
Mansfield. Ohio. " The doctor said I had dis-
ease of the throat and -bronchial tubes. I con-
tinued to grow worse. I Had pain in the upper
tjart of my chest and a severe cough, which
grew worse at night and in the morning, with
heavy expectoration. I would cough up mat-
tery' scabs, after which I would experience a
burnirig-and smarting sensation in my throat.
I took the doctor's prescriptions without num-
ber, but they did me no good-. I took sixteen
bottles of coil liver oil and was as bad as ever. I
then took five- bottles of Dr. Pierces. Golden
Medical Discovery, and three of the 'Pellets.'
I began to improve iri every way~and now en-
joy good health and have taken no medicine far
over six months." ;
was preceded by a brief argument by
Senator Morgan, in which he went over
the general grounds favorable to the
construction of the canal. He con
troverted the opinion that the addi
tional amendment would be detrimental
to the. interests of the river and harbor
bill, and expressed a preference for the
river and. harbor bill over the sundry
civil appropriation bill as a vehicle to
carry the canal bill. There was no pro
longed discussion among the members
of the commiteee. and there seemed lit
tle division of opinion as to the wisdom
of attaching the amendment to one of
the appropriation measures. Some of
the. members expressed the desire that
the amendment should go on the sun
dry civil bill, but a motion to recom
mend that it be .incorporated in that
measure was voted down, seven nays
to four ayes.
i Senator Morgan then moved the
amendment to the river and harbor
bill, which prevailed, seven to four, as
follows: Ayesâ Nelson, Berry, Penrose,
McÃride, McMillan, Elkins and Jones
of Nevada. Senator Frye, chairman of
the committee did not vote. Nays â
Caffery. Mills, Pascoe and Murphy.
While Senator Caffery voted against
the amendment he did not indicate any
purpose to oppose the passage of the
bill in the Senate because of the incor
poration of the canal provision. He
joined with all. the other members of
the committee in the vote to report the

HUNTINGTON'S BARGAIN.
NEW YORK, Feb. 17.-A special to the
Journal from Washington says: One hun
! dred and thirty-two delegates to the next
Republican National Convention. That is
' what Collis P. Huntington, transconti
nental railway magnate and multi-mil
lionaire, has pledged to deliver to Thomas
B. Reed, Speaker of the House of Repre
sentatives, Republican aspirant for the
Presidency in 1900. The votes are to be
delivered only on condition that Speaker
â  Reed prevents the passage of the Nicar
agua canal bill.- '
| The story, of this combination between
I Collis P. Huntington and Speaker Reed is
persistently current here. The fate of
the Nicaragua canal bill means millions
to. Mr. Huntington. If it becomes a law
!it means, millions in loss. If it is defeated
I it: means millions In profits, because it
| perpetuates, perhaps for years, a monop
oly of the carrying, trade' between the At
lantic and Pacific seaboards now enjoyed
by the transcontinental railways owned
and controlled by Huntington. That is
Huntington's side. of the case.
-.The fate of the Nicaragua bill means
much to Speaker Reed, if the promise bo
kept. â¢ Animated by ambition to become
â¢President of the United States, and ham
pered Jn his ambitions by lack of money
necessary to conduct a winning campaign,
the. tempting offer of 132 delegates in a
.bunch has made him a foe of the isthmian
waterway:. That is Reed's side of the
proposition. That is the explanation of
the House finding itself unable to consider
or pass any Nicaraguan canal bill.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURD AT, FEBRUARY 18, 1899.
McKINLEY MAKES
RINGING SPEECHES
President Talks to Grand Army Veterans,
Commercial Men and Massachusetts
Legislators at Boston.
BOSTON, Feb. 17.â The last day of
President McKinley's visit to Boston
was spent in one continual round of
pleasure, and â¢ the different events
which were crowded into the few re
maining hours followed each other with
bewildering rapidity. The President
arose and breakfasted at 9 o'clock,- and
at 10 o'clock was en route to Tremont
Temple, where he spoke to the members
of the Massachusetts Department of
the G. A. R., who were assembled in
annual convention.
The President and his associates
were received with cheers by the old
soldiers. President McKinley was In
troduced and made a brief address, re
calling the spirit with which they en
tered the war of the rebellion and their
loyalty and faithfulness to the repub
lic. He referred to the stirring scenes
of the last year, which, he said, he was
glad they had lived to see, and closed
by suggesting that the Spanish war
veterans should be admitted to mem
bership in the G. A. R. The suggestion
was received with cries of "Good" and
â  applause.
j In response to calls Secretaries Alger,
j Long, Gage and Smith spoke briefly
! and the party then proceeded to the
! State Capitol to visit the Legislature.
The members of the Legislature
i gathered with unusual promptness at
! the Statehouse in anticipation of the
j visit of President McKinley. An hour
i before the time announced for his ar
i rival the corridors were thronged and
| as soon as the balconies of the House
i were opened the crowd pushed in until
{ every seat was taken. The entire floor
was reserved : for members of the twb
branches of the general court, the ex
ecutive department and the distin
guished guests.
The President and his party arrived
promptly at the time scheduled and
after being received by Governor Wol
cott under escort of Sergeant-at-Arms
J. B. Adams, the party proceeded to the
House. They passed down the main
aisle amid cheers of all present, who
arose the moment President McKinley
was announced.
President George " F. Smith, for the
Massachusetts Senate, welcomed the
distinguished guest in a brief speech
and Introduced him to the convention.
As the President arose a wave of ap
plause rolled through the hall and cheer
i upon cheer rang out. When it was
! possible for him to be heard the Presi

MURDERER KNOTT
DECLARED INSANE
Slayer of Knauer Will
Not Be Hanged.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL,, Feb. 17.â "1 tell you
I am not Insane. I am as much in my
right mind as any of you and I think
it a shame that I should be treated in
this manner. Somebody will be sorry
for it yet." V'i~â v.-', ""\~'-J
With the tears streaming down his
cheeks and his voice husky with the
violence of his passion A. L. Knott
stood in the center of a group of in
terested auditors and uttered these
! words to-day after a jury had decided
j that he was * insane and therefore
j should not be hanged. The examina
! tion of the condemned murderer was
I the first of the kind ever held in this
State and the strangeness of the pro
ceedings attracted a large crowd.
On July 6, 1897, Knott 'shot and killed
Joseph Knauer, a San -Francisco bar
' ber, because the latter had kicked the
j murderer's dog eighteen months pre-
I viously. He was convicted and sen
| tenced by Judge Wallace to be hanged.
j The case went before the Supreme
! Court on appeal and the judgment of
I the lower court was affirmed. Knott
thereupon was sentenced to be hanged
j on March 21.
Some time ago Warden Hale became
1 convinced that Knott was insane. He
! desired that Governor Gage hear the
i evidence regarding his sanity, as Gov
ernor Budd had considered the cases of
Worden, the train wrecker, and Mc-
Carthy, the Sonoma murderer. This
Mr. Gage refused to do, saying that
legal procedure, as laid down in section
1221, et seq., of the Penal Code, should
first be exhausted.
Accordingly Warden Hale had a jury
summoned and. to-day occupied the po-
sition of Superior Judge. Judge Angel
lotti sat merely as his adviser. District
Attorneys Murphy of San Francisco
and Mclsaacs of Marin County con
ducted the case for the people and At
torney Henry Ach for the defendant.
The affidavit of about twenty-five
leading merchants of the metropolis,
asserting their belief that Knott was
insane at the time the deed' was com
mitted, was read. Then followed the
affidavits of Dr. Lawlor, the prison
physician, and Drs. Rethers and Lus
tig of the State Lunacy Commission.
Drs. Lustig and Lawlor also testified
in person. Eight witnesses from San
Francisco, including Under . Sheriff
Martin, appeared and gave their testi
mony. â¢â â â *} ;' ;â ";-'."'<:":--' i '"*' " ; -''.~>-
Knott was decided insane by the jury
a few minutes after, the evidence was
all in. Judge Murphy admitted that he
had no doubt Knott was Insane.
As soon as the verdict was reached
Knott broke forth into a tirade, de
claring himself as sane as anybody and
threatening to "get even." The vero
indefinitely postpones his execution and
he will now be sent to an asylum. The
law is such, however, that if at any
time he should be adjudged to have re
gained his reason the Governor may
order him to be executed. It is stated
that at the time of his trial Knott re
fused to let any evidence regarding his
_ sanity *-Â» .introduced. *

We may regard the situation before us

The applause that followed the re
marks of the .President continued for
some minutes.' The members of the
joint convention were then introduced
to the President, standing in front of
the Speaker's'desk.
After the members had resumed their
seats, there were loud cries for Secre

Gage to the convention.
Secretary Gage closed the speech

The party then proceeded to the Al

PLAN TO FORM
A NEW STATE
Project Being Agitated
in Texas.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FORT WORTH, Tex., Feb. 17.â The
creation of a new State out of the
Territory of New Mexico and that por
tion of the State of Texas lying- be
tween the Pecos and Rio Grande rivers
is being agitated and may assume for
midable shape. The matter is particu
larly being discussed by the people of
El Paso, who want that place to be
made the capital of the proposed new
State. It is a fact that El Paso Is the
leading city between Fort Worth and
Los Angeles, and a place destined to
become a great city.
The scheme as proposed means the
formation of a "great State." The
Llewellyn memorial now pending in
the legislative Assembly asks that' the
present Governors of New Mexico and
Texas - appoint a commission of three
Congressmen, three Senators and . 100
citizens of Texas to meet in Demine.
N. M., July 4, 1899, to consider a basis
upon which the cession of territory
from the State of Texas may be ac
complished. â _
The report comes that a majority of
the citizens of El Paso are anxious for
annexation to New Mexico for the for
mation of a new State. They j claim
El Paso is the tail end of Texas, and
is as much isolated as if situated in
California. In the politics of the State,
her citizens claim, they have never re
ceived recognition; hence they want to
become part of the new State. It is
conceded that the extreme west end of
the State is not and never was .under
Democratic rule, a factor of the politics
of the Lone Star State. It is commer

ble than he has been for many years. He
has taken on new courage and confidence.
He Is satisfied with the revenue and finan
cial policies of his country. He can now
make accurate calculations on .the fu
ture.
The past year has recorded a volume of
business, domestic and foreign, unparal
leled in any former operations of the
United States. Our enormous export trade
had made American balances satisfac
tory, and almost for the first time the
money of the country has been so abun
dant and the wealth of the country so
great that our capitalists have sought
foreign investments. We are fast going
from a debtor to a creditor nation. I
hope nothing will check it. We have quit
discussing the tariff and have turned our
attention to getting trade wherever it can
be found. It will be a long time before
any change can be had or any change de
sired in the present discal policy except
to strengthen it. The differences on this
question which have existed have disap
peared. We have turned from academic
theories to trade conditions and are seek
ing our share of the world's market.
Not only is our business good, but our
money is good. There' is no longer fear of
debased currency; it has been happily dis
pelled. The highest and best standard
recognized by the leading commercial na
tions has been maintained, and it has been
done without a resort to loans. The cause
of sound money has advanced in the last
two years. Honest finance has made posi
tive gains. Ido not think we quite appre
ciate yet the full measure of its success.
Both branches of Congress on the fourth
of March next will have an unquestioned
majority opposed to any demoralization
of our currency and committed to up
hold the world's standard. Certainly for
two years every branch of the national
Government will be united for goood cur
rency and the involubllity of our national
obligations and credit. The investments
and other enterprises of the people can
therefore not be unsettled by sudden
changes.
We have been engaged in war. Two
hundred and seventy thousand of our
â 4-<s> â¬>-â¦- citizens have
â¦ <Â£> been in the field.

ity and prosperity.
Our domestic situation is fortunate in
deed, considering the new questions which
we must meet and solve. That they will
be settled on the lines of right, and duty
I cannot doubt, and that the business
men of Boston and the whole country will
be active and helpful in the rightful so
lution I confidently believe.
After a short reception the Presiden
tial party was taken on a tour throuerh
the subway and thence to the Algon
quin Club, where a breakfast was ten
dered to the gentlemen by the mem
bers of the Commercial Club. .
At 4:50 the party was taken to the
South Terminal station and they left

at 5:10. Secretary Long did not return
with the party, preferring to go to his
home at Higham, with Mrs. Loner, and

and Chihuahua.
It is said but few people in that part
of Texas oppose the annexation
scheme, while quite an opposition is
said to exist among people in New
Mexico, especially among Democrats,
as they fear if a new State is created
it will become Republican, and on this
theory are opposing-it. Those of New
Mexico who favor annexation believe
that if it is ever accomplished the
Statehood question would at once be
settled, and for this reason those who
want to come into the Union are work
ing hard for annexation. There are
those, however, who look upon the
move as -in impossibility, and among
this class is Judge W. S. Smallwood.
who lives at El Paso. He said:
"Texas will not cede one foot' of her
territory. In my opinion agitation of
the annexation question Is useless, for
Texas would never agree to it. Texas
glories in. her length and breadth, and.
above all things, she is proud of her
size. I do not believe the people gen
erally want annexation."
SAN JOSE COUNCILMAN
WARNED BY A CRANK
Threatened With Death Because the
Board Is Beautifying the
Streets.
SAN JOSE, Feb. . This city is pos
sessed of a bloodthirsty crank who ob
jects to the. City Council making street
improvements and otherwise beautifying
the thoroughfares. So strong is he in his
objections that he had decided to take
things into his hands, and. if necessary
to stop street work, proposes to anni
hilate the whole Council.
Councilman H. M. Spring, qhairman of
the street committee, has received a warn
ing, in the shape of a letter, that unless
he "quits ordering street improvements
he will be paid for it with a bullet in his
brain." This is written with red ink and
accompanied by the customary skull and
crossbones. The writer is supposed to be
some crank, and no attention will be paid
to his threatening missive. -.;'

HOWARD SHIELDS
BANK OFFICIALS
Says the Wrights Were
Not His Partners. f-
Special Dispatch to. The Call. -' . .
SAN JOSE,' Feb. 17.â The bankruptcy
petition of E, B. Howard, whose gamb
ling in fruit, wrecked the Union Sav
ings Bank, will be filed to-morrow af
ternoon in the United States Court at
San Francisco. Just what â¦disclosures
will be made his attorneys ' refuse to
say, but it is hinted the papers will
make interesting reading. .. It is expect
ed the liabilities will run from $300,000
to $500,000, with practically no assets-
Howard's attorneys have said positive
ly that the papers will in no way con
nect the Wrights with their client's
dealings, despite all the street talk that
they had a secret partnership. '.: '.
The directors of the Union Savings
Bank will hold another meeting to-mor
row. ' The affairs of the bank will be
thoroughly discussed and an ;.' effort
made to find out just how badly things
are mixed. This will be done in order
that a report may made to the stock
holders when they meet on the 28th
inst. Bank Commissioner Barrett Is' in
town superintending affairs.
District Attorney Campbell to-day
made a vigorous denial of the story to
th'; effect that he had refused to prose
cute the directors of the Union Savings
Bank when requested, to do so at the
instance of a depositor. Yesterday
afternoon just as Mr. Campbell was
about to argue in his election contest
D. F. Leffler and another man came to
him and asked for a warrant for. the
arrest of the directors of ' the ; bank.
They exhibited a clipping from. a news
paper and said they wanted the officials
prosecuted for making false statements
to the Bank Commission. He told Mr.
Leffler that he would look into the case
and he would do whatever was war
ranted. Leffler demanded immediate
attention and was referred to Assistant
District Attorney Coolidge. -He.- was
told to give his data to Coolidge and
the. subject would investigated and
if proof was forthcoming he would pre
pare papers for him. This Leffler re-:
fused to do and made a tragical de
mand for justice that smacked. strongly
of politics. - '
Campbell said to-day that, he stood
ready to prosecute all wrongdoers, but
he intended to investigate cases before
issuing warrants, especially when the
warrants are for prominent men, who
would not be liable to run away.
W. J. Edwards to-day transferred a
lot on William street", to the Union. Sav
ings Bank. Edwards is an employe- of
the institution- and he undoubtedly held,
the property for the bank.
Attorney. J. R. Welch; representing a

EMILE LOUBET
THE FAVORITE
Will Probably Secure!
the Presidency.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Press.
PARIS. Feb. Everything is very
quiet in Paris to-day. There is no dan- j
ger of a coup d'etat. The favorite can
didate for the Presidency is M. Emile
Loubet, now President of the Senate.
Still the Ministers whom I saw to-day j
think that Faure's death is a misfor- i
tune at the present juncture, and this is !
the conventional talk. They had all
looked forward to his having soon to i
resign, and they spoke to-day of . the
possible effect of his death on the
courts of Europe.
If M. Loubet be elected European j
sovereigns would soon transfer to him j
their friendly regards. He .is a good,
unaffected, level-headed man of honest, |
open life and of far more intellectual
culture than poor Faure. He is an ad- j
vocate and practiced at the Montilemar j
bar, in the department of the Drome. j
Montilemar is his native town.
As a precaution against a coup d'etat I
or any attempts of the sort the troops
have been ordered to keep within bar- j
racks' in all the garrisons.
M. Faure's body, now embalmed, is
lying in state in the Salles dcs Fetes of !
the theater built by President Carnot ;
for. concerts and dramatic entertain- j
ments. The corpse is on .-an. .inclined
plane, the head being eighteen inches I
higher than the feet. The body is
dressed in evening coat- and the im- j
maculate well-known white waistcoat, i
athwart which' is the broad red ribbon j
of watered silk of the Legion of Honor.
The eyes are closed and fill out the eye- j
lids. The hands, of the color of ivory,
are crossed on the breast. The black
canopy, bordered' with silver braid,
overshadows the couch. Previous to ;
embalming the body : lay on a brass j
bedstead In the President's sitting- i
room. Two sisters of charity watched i
beside it. Before the operation, which j
lasted an hour, took place an informal
dead mass was celebrated in the Elysee
Chapel. ">*Â» ? - ,* - '
â¢ To-day the whole official world has
paid formal visits of condolence at the
palace* the formality consisting in
writing the visitor's name on the regis
ter. Piles of telegrams from corporate
bodies, personal friends, sympathizers
in all parts of France, and indeed Eu
rope and even Asia, have arrived. . The
first to telegraph to Mme. Faure was
Emperor William: the next Prince
Ferdinand of Bulgaria. The army has
been ordered to go into mourning until
after the obsequies.
Public events in France have a
strange suddenness and - take sponta
neously a dramatic character. Thus
M. Faure's body lies in a salles dcs
fetes, or hall of festivities. The cards
had been issued to 6000 persons to at-'
tend a state ball next Thursday. . To
day the tapestry of the ballroom has
been taken down that the room may be
hung in black. -M. Faure had looked
forward with delight to the Elysee be
; ing in 1900 the resort of sovereigns.
The last letter he had from Emperor
Nicholas was an acceptance of his (M.
Faure's) invitation. He took great
pleasure, also, in thinking that mem
bership in the Order of the Annuncia
tion would make him ' a "cousin"' of
King Humbert, and the insignia of that
order was to have . been presented to
i him by a special embassy this month.-
But his soul was suddenly required of
him, and all connected with his Presi-
I dential career, is . over. His death
preaches a sermon upon the vanity of
; human' ambition. '
I M. Lockroy, the Minister of Marine,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 18,: 1899.
"The report Is inaccurate," she con
tinued, "in many respects besides the
main fact of the' elopement. I have
lived in this city for four months and
until recently Mr. Dehlholm has been
with me and my little child. He agreed
that it would be better for us to stay
here for a while and he returned to
Salinas. : -'-."â¢
"Last Monday he returned and pro
ducing an anonymous letter with vile
words accused me of infidelity. Though
I denied knowledge of Mr. Widemann's
whereabouts he attacked me, beating
my face and body, so that I was obliged
to seek neighbors' protection. The po
lice wanted me to prosecute him, but I
dreaded the notoriety.
"We have been married for about
seven years, but were never congenial,
although I have been a good wife to
him. It was not a love match and
since he has returned from the Klon
dike, when he only allowed me $15 a
month for myself and child, I think he
has been mentally changed.' I have'
been working to support myself and
child and this story, which I have no
doubt originated with .him, and his
brutal attack on me have decided me
to commence proceedings for divorce at
once."
is especially struck with the example
M. Faure's death gives of the fragility
of human greatness. Twice yesterday
he communicated with the ; President
on naval affairs. M. Faure, as a for
mer ship agent and charterer at Havre,
and once himself Minister of Marine,
deemed himself a naval authority. His.
naval hobby was a fleet of Corsair
cruisers to attack in case of war
English transatlantic steamers. M.
Lockroy humored him and often con
sulted him, and now he cannot realize
that the President is no more. He says
he feels as he did once during an earth
quake.
The total eclipse of the Elyslan prep
arations for festivity by the deepest
mourning also comes home to Lock
roy. ;. *â 'â¢
Some fatality follows the Presidents
of the French republic. Of the six we
have had only President Grew lived
through a full term of office, and he
was forced to resign by a hostile vote
of Parliament. Marshal MacMahon
found he could not remain President
with dignity. M. Casimlr-Perler's mo
tives for throwing up the situation are
still a mystery. Carnot- was assassinat
ed and Faure smitten as If by a thun
derbolt.
M. Lockroy, who was present at the
death, thinks it was 'painless. Dr.
Lanne-Longue shares this opinion, but
believes there was in the early stages
of apoplectic seizure agonizing pain.
The doctor attributes the break down
in the President's health to Fashoda.
President Faure had fostered the
scheme Major Marchand was sent to
accomplish, and he was terrified at Its
possible consequences. Dr. Lanne-
Longue tells me that after the Fashoda
incident M. Faure lost his appetite. It
was then he began to feel so limp in
the legs that he feared to ride on horse
back. Yesterday the sense of limpness
was so distressing that he gave up the
idea of a canter in the Pols de Bou
logne. He usually went there between
8 and 10 in the morning mounted on
a thoroughbred. He was rond of sroine:
to. small morning reviews at Lone
champs and of taking up a position be
tide the reviewing general.
I have been to see the Abbe Penault.
who gave M. Faure absolution in ex
tremis. Mme. Faure, on seeing that
death was hastening, begged that mes
sengers should be sent to summon
three different priests and a Domini
can. . All the- priests, she thought,
would not be out dining, the Dominican
would surely be at his monastery. She
also begged that if any messenger met
a priest in the streets he should bring
him at once; to the Elysee.
Abbe Renault is the humblest of the
humble, being chaplain to the House
of Detention, or lock-up, at the Pre
fecture of Police. Yesterday he had
dined with some relatives who have a
small Shop in the Fauborg St. Honore.
After dinner he was going home when
suddenly a soldier on a bicycle came
up, - descended from the machine and
caught him with visible agitation by
the arm, saying, "Come with me."
.. Father Renault went and learned
where he was going at the Palace gate.
There the soldier said: "The President
is dying. Do what you can for him.
He is not a bad. chap."
At the door a porter met the Abbe
and conducted him to the sitting-room.
The President was lying on a mattress
upon the floor. He was in a flannel
shirt and covered with draperies; his '
feet were wrapped in steaming, flan
nels, his nostrils assailed' with the
mingled smells of mustard and ether,
and blood flowing from his temples,
neck and forearm, for leeches, cup
ping, hypodermic Interjections and
bleeding had been tried. The face was
almost black with . congestion. One
doctor had drawn the tongue to keep
the lungs alive; another held a bag of
oxygen to his nose and was rubbing
the hands. But no sign of returning
animation was given. Dr. Lanne-
Longue said: "We have â¢ done all we
can. Let religion to console "the family
now come .'ln." ... ... ..â ;'â â .
j The Abbe dropped on his knees, all
present doing likewise and gave absolu
tion In extremis. He had no holy oil to
administer, extreme: unction. In ' the
next room the ladies were sobbing. The
i Ministers came in and dropped on their ,

Auspicious Opening of the Bey=

Cioverdale.
CLOVERDALE, Feb. 17.â The sev
enth annual citrus fair opened to-night
under favorable auspices. It was to
have opened at noon, but the exhibitors
were slow and the exhibits are large
and require much time and labor. The
pavilion at noon was almost in a state
of chaos, but out of this chaos has
come order and beauty, and to-night
the vast pavilion was a veritable Gar
den of Eden. No such a display has
ever greeted the eyes of visitors to
citrus fairs of the past. ,";.,;
Magnificent are the decorations this
year, a San Francisco decorator having
Instituted new ideas in this line. Myr
iads of large and small flags of white,
green and orange and the national flag
bedeck the high arch above the main
hall and are festooned in every nook
and corner. Many and varied are the
exhibits, and all of an artistic nature.
A. Coughey has four pyramids of
large navel oranges.
The Preston exhibit, a collective one
from the little village three miles north
of Cloverdale, occupies prominent space
on the right of the entrance. It con
sists of a twenty-foot table laden with
large navel oranges, Mediterranean
sweets and lemons in pyramids and
piles, with the name "Preston" .in
large letters spelled, with immense
oranges over the exhibit. In this ex
hibit are a dozen mammoth navel
oranges from a three-year-old tree.
George H. Black of Geyserville dis
plays oranges raised at Geyser Peak,
3500 feet above the sea level, the dis
play representing a rustic stile embow
ered with growing orange trees bear
ing fruit. , ,
The Misses Lena Brush of Cloverdale
and Mayme Potter and Bonnie Wag
goner of Sacramento have one of the
unique exhibits of the fair in the way
of an art studio or curiosity room.
Ancient and recent works of art in all
lines vie with large oranges and lemons,
all placed In , one harmonious whole,
which is pleasing and catching to the
eye.
Secretary H. Fred Domine is soaring
high, as one visitor expressed it, with
his Jacob's ladder built of citrus fruits
embellished with hothouse plants on a
foundation of blue grass. ; .;' ;
Director G- Hagmayer has a large
i pyramid of navel oranges and lemons.
Mrs. L. A. Domine has an excellent
imitation of the Russian River bridge
near Cloverdale built of oranges and
lemons with a mirror deceit of water
beneath with electric effects.
E. G. Furber's attractive display is
a globe formed of navel oranges and
artistically decorated.
President William Caldwell has a
miniature representation of the San
knees. As the clock on the mantel
struck ten a doctor said "All is over."
Some persons went into the next room
to inform Mme. Faure and her daugh
ters. She soon came out, and .with,
great composure, as if her grief was
suddenly hushed, ordered that the body
be placed on the President's brass
railed-bed and be kept until embalmed
as long as possible. She thanked the
priest for rendering the last offices to
a Christian and said that before the
President lost consciousness he had
prayed for forgiveness of all whom he
might have offended. "His tongue was
paralyzed as he spoke," she said, and
again "the poor have lost in his death a
good friend." At her request some
prayers were recited by the Abbe, who
was profoundly affected by the whole
scene. ,
The German Emperor's telegram is
effusive. Dowager Queen Emma and
Queen Wilhelmlna of the Netherlands
have telegraphed heartfelt condolences.
Queen Victoria as ' yet has made no
sign, but Lord Salisbury has in a mes
sage to M. Delcasse. The Czar and
Czarina are full of sympathy and the
Russian Grand Dukes now in Paris
have called at the Palace.
M. FaUre's death has calmed rather
than excited political parties. The sit
uation is grave and the people every
where feel this. I was struck at the
Chamber of Deputies with the. absence
of wild excitement. The wish is to se
lect the best man for President, irre
spective of party considerations. M.
Loubet is therefore the favorite. M.
Dupuy is a candidate, and Paul Des
chanel, the President of the Chamber,
will be a candidate, but on second bal
lot. He has charm of manner, but is
lacking in weight. M. de Freycinet. the
War Minister, is clever, but he has no
great following in Parliament.

NERVOUS DEPRESSION.
[A TALK WITH MRS. PINKHAM.] .
A woman with the blues is a very un-
comfortable person. She is illogical,
unhappy and frequently hysterical.
The condition of the mind known as
" the blues," nearly always, with wo-
men, results from diseased organs of
generation.
It is a source of wonder that in this
age of advanced medical science, any
person should still* believe that mere
force of will and determination will
overcome depressed spirits and nerv-
ousness in women. These troubles are
indications of disease.
Every woman who doesn't under-
stand her condition should write to
Lynn, Mass., to Mrs. Pinkham for her
advice. Her advice is thorough com-
mon sense, and is the counsel of a.
learned woman of great experience.
Bead the story of Mrs. $. S. Bennett,-
Westphalia, Kansas, as told in the fol-
lowing letter:
M Dear Mrs. PrNEHAM:â I have suf-
fered for over two years with falling,
enlargement and ulceration of the
womb, and this â¢ spring, being in such .
a weakened condition, caused me to
flow for nearly six months. Some time
ago, urged by friends, I wrote to you
for advice. After using the treatment
which you advised for a short time,
that terrible flow stopped.
"I am now gaining strength and !
flesh, and have better health than I
have had for the past ten years. I
wish to say to all distressed, suffer-
ing women, do not suffer longer, when
there is one so kind and willing to
aid you."

pound is a woman's remedy for. wo-
man's ills. More than a million wo-
men have been benefited by it

The official certificate sets forth that
the death of the President was caused
by congestion and hemorrhage of the
brain.
Although M. Loubet, possessing al
most the unanimous support of the
Senate, is so strong a favorite for the
Presidency, it would be rash to predict
his election. In the election of 1895,
when M. Faure was chosen, W. Wal
deck-Rousseau was an almost equally
hot favorite, but in the first ballot he
only obtained 185 votes against 314 cast
in favor of M. Brisson. The precedents
therefore are unfavorable to M. Loubet.
Furthermore, there is a large sec
tion of Deputies who strongly favor M.
Meline. When at the meeting of pro
gressive republican Deputies to-day M.
Meline announced his withdrawal on
the ground that a continuance of his
candidature would divide the party and
perhaps cause its defeat, a noisy dis
cussion followed. A large â¢ section
firmly opposed the withdrawal, Un
able to arrive at a unanimous decision,
the group adjourned until to-night,
when It reassembled at half-past 9
o'clock. Resolutions were then adopt
ed unanimously in favor of M. Meline's
candidature, and the leaders of the
party In the chamber were directed to
endeavor to arrange an understanding
on the subject with the leaders in the
Senate.

CHARACTER TO
SLAY HIS WIFE
TACOMA, Feb. 17.â John L. Tait. :
County Superintendent of Schools until
last month and since made a member
.of the High School faculty, is either a
victim of one of the strangest hallucin
ations that ever disturbed the eouiDoise
of a steady brain, or else with guilty
cunning he has planned the murder of
hif own wife.
Tait says the allegations against him
are all a mistake, averring that pub
;lie reports and the incriminating cir
cumstances exposed by the investiga
tion that the police have made are the
resiilt or' his ardent application to the
study of sociology and of the villainy
or gullibility of Timothy O'Hrit-n.
O'Brien is a rough character who has
several tinves turned State's evidence
against his pals to save himself from
jail. It is -with O'Brien that Tait is
charged with having carried on nego
tiations for the murder of his wife.
Two weeks ago Tait approached
O'Brien, the latter says, and asked
him if he was willing to undertake a
dangerous job providing there was
enough money in it. O'Brien said he
was. There were subsequently meet
ings of the two, at which Professor
Tait desired O'Brien to kill his wife,
for which deed he would pay him $500.
Tait's self-confessed object was to get
the insurance on his wife's life and val
uable papers which he could not obtain
while she lived.
All this time, however, O'Brien was
â¢in touch with the police and posting
them on the progress being made, with
the determination of turning Tait over
'to the authorities when the right time
arrived.
. The plan was at last matured. Pro
fessor Tait. Mrs. Tait and the profes
sor's sister were to make a call on Fif
teenth, .street, O'Brien was to meet the]
trip as they left the house, and under |
the .'pretense, of holding them up. was
to shoot Mrs.. Tait through the head.

i Mr: Tait was to throw up his arm as
if in protection and O'Brien was to
shoot him through the arm. thus di
verting suspicion. -Miss Tait would
have been an uninjured witness.
The sequel came on Wednesday
night, when the last meeting between
them was held. O'Brien notified the
police, and Chief Read, accompanied
by two detectives, was in hiding be
hind a fence where they met. Tait
and O'Brien then arranged that the
murder should take place on Thursday
night. As they were separating the
detectives arrested them both.
Tait was put in the "sweatbox" and
subjected to a most, crucial examina
tion. He declared he was studying
[ criminology and had. procured from
former City Detective Con Cannon the
names of fifteen criminals living here.
| Tait said that he ..wanted to study the
workings of their minds while engaged
in criminal operations. He selected
O'Brien and proposed the killing of
his own wife because it seemed the
most terrible crime that another man
could be hired to commit.
Tait was finally released on condition
that he leave the city, the police find
ing he could not be held for "con
spiracy" because his confederate had
had no guilty intent. Mrs. Tait re
fuses to believe her husband had any
guilty intention. She left with him
last night for Rossland, where her
mother lives, the object/being to re
lieve Tait of the nervous strain he has
been undergoing.
Tait's mother and sister say he has
been studying criminology for months,
having announced his intention to
write better detective stories than
Conan Doyle. Tait is one of the best
educated men in the city and a deacon
in the First Presbyterian Church. He
frequently has preached sermons. Mrs.
Tait's life, it seems, is insured for $2500
in the name of their two little children.
Tait telegraphed this evening from
Rossland that he would . return next
week. â¢'.'',' \\:~~".z : '"'-

WOMAN WITNESS
SCORES DR. CRABB
Says He Should Be in
San Quentin.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
: SAN JOSE, Feb. 17.â "A man who
would railroad a woman to an insane ;
asylum ought to be sent to San Quen
tin, and I would take pleasure In bring
ing him there."
These words were uttered by Mrs. H.
A. McCormack, a witness for the de
fendant in the divorce case of the Rev.
W. H. Crabb against his wife. Hattle.
The woman who made the bold state
ment was instrumental in effecting
Mrs. Crabb's release from the State
asylum at Agnews and. since the lat
ter's liberation, has cared for her. The
reply was made, to a question put by
Attorney C. H. Cobb in cross-examina
tion, and he, his client and the large
audience present were astounded at her
answer.
Unabashed at the attack on the doc
tor, the youthful lawyer returned to the
fray, but received a still greater shock
when Mrs. McCormack, in unqualified
terms, accused his client of beine a j
prevaricator and of having been proved j
as such. Before leaving the witness
stand she informed the court that in a
conversation with Dr. Crabb she asked
him how he dared preach after what
he had done.
Numerous letters written by the pas
tor were introduced in evidence by At
torney Thompson to show the former's
kindly feeling toward his wife. Coun
sel for the plaintiff was satisfied with
the epistles, as they proved that the
doctor had warned his wife not to talk
about him. â  > :-â 
Mrs. E. B. McClure of Gilroy was
placed on the stand by the defense, and
testified to the pleasant relations be
tween the minister and his wife during
their residence in Gilroy. She said she
was shocked by the doctor asking her
at her home whether she noticed any
thing strange in his wife's actions. At
torney Burchard was desirous of cross
examining the witness, but was de
tained at home by illness, and the
woman w as excused until Monday.
Dr. F. M. Sponogle also testified, and
the balance of the day was devoted to
the reading of correspondence.
CATHEDBAL MISSION.
Bedemptorist Fathers Will Be at St.

The Redemptorist Fathers will open a

der will conduct the mission. Two of
them. Rev. Fathers Bond and Hlld, have
already arrived in the city, and the third,
Father Brown, will arrive to-day.
The opening sermon will be preached at
the 11 o'clock high mass to-morrow. The
evening devotions will begin at 7:30
o'clock. - .
During the week the first mass with
sermon will begin at 5:30. o'clock. The
second mass and sermon will be at 9
o'clock and the evening devotions at 7:30
o'clock.
LASSIES AS FIRE LADDIES.
A Serious Conflagration at St. Luke's
Hospital Averted by Nurses.
But for the bravery and energetic ef
forts of the nurses; at St. Luke's Hospital
that well-known institution might ' have
been destroyed yesterday afternoon and
the lives of many helpless inmates lost.
Fire was discovered in the east wing
about 4 o'clock, and the young ladles
who minister to the wants of the Injured
and afflicted were warned, and they
quickly formed themselves into an em
bryo fire brigade. While some of the
ladies mounted to the blazing roof others
stood on the ladder and passed up water
and the flames were extinguished before
the arrival of the Fire Department. The
fire is attributed to falling sparks from
an adjoining chimney, and the damage to
the building is placed at $30. "> - : V

AMERICANS AID
IN THE UPRISING
Fighting Under Reyes in
Nicaragua.
Special Dispatch to j The Call.
NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 17. â The
steamship Condor arrived to-day from
Bluefields, Nicaragua, and brought
mail advices from the Reyes revolution.
In the beginning of the year Reyes
sent his resignation to Zelaya, accus
ing the latter of mismanagement and
dishonesty. On January 26 the authori
ties commenced gathering troops, os
tensibly as a protection against Hon
duras insurgents, and the defenses of
the city were manned. Reyes an
nounced that General Aurelio Estrada
had been named as his successor and
would arrive on January 31. On Janu
ary 30 the people held a mass meeting
and protested against anybody taking
the place of Reyes.
On February 2 General Estrada ar
rived with seventy men to fill various
Government positions. After being
talked to by Reyes and the citizens.
Estrada refused to accept the office of
Governor, but said he would go to the
interior and return with troops to set
tle the trouble with fire and blood.
Reyes insisted on turning affairs over,
but Estrada left, leaving the depart
ment without a Governor. Troops and
citizens called on Reyes and insisted on
his taking charge. He consented and
issued a call to arms, "to precipitate
the impertinent oppressor that has the
republic in horrible agony," and of
fering to die at the front in the cause
of liberty.
On Saturday, February 4, Reyes ap
pointed Ignacio Suarez Governor,
lowered the duties and organized his
army. On Sunday a number of Ameri
cans and other foreigners joined him
and a company was organized, com
manded by J. C. Kennedy of the Louis
iana Field Artillery, New Orleans; Cap
tain Forsgard of the Seeley Rifles of
Galveston and Burt Umstatt, an old
Indian scout, as lieutenants. Reyes has
2000 Remington, rifles and plenty of
ammunition.' . - y
On Saturday night Reyes and 350
men left for Greytown, but their boat
struck shoals, so they marched over
land to Roma, which will require three
days. The rebels seized the lake
steamer and a Hotchkiss gun. News
from the interior says the insurgent
army is growing steadily. The Marietta
had not arrived up to February 10.
TEACHERS WILL ENJOIN.
A Bemarkable Compromise Proposed
by the Merchant Creditors.
Mrs. Clara Arguello.a teacher recently
dismissed from her position, filed an ap
plication yesterday for a writ of mandate,
ordering the Board of Education to re
instate her in the department. Her attor
neys are Judge W. L. Pierce and Henley &
Costello, and she represents sixteen teach
ers, who were removed at the same time.
The injunction . case . of Elisha Brooks,
principal of the Girls' High School,
against Auditor Wells,' now being tried
In Judge Seawell's court, was continued
yesterday morning for one week on a joint :
motion of the attorneys. It is understood
that a compromise is being arranged be
tween the teachers and merchants, by
which the teachers will, withdraw their
suit, permitting the merchant creditors
to recover as much of the money due
them as the state. of the fund will allow.
For this concession the merchants will
loan the teachers 30 per cent of .what may
be recovered, and if the teachers succeed
afterward in getting any of their Novem
ber and December salaries they will re
turn the loan. "TjnWIIWWPIBHBOO

TAX COLLECTOR
DENIED RIGHT
OF PATRONAGE
No Power to Hire
"Extra" Clerks.
Judge Hebbard handed down a decision
: yesterday in the case of Homer C. War
! ren against the Board of Supervisors, in
which the plaintiff, who was an "extra"
deputy in the Tax Collector's office,
sought to compel the defendant, by writ
] of mandate, to audit his demands for
salary. Warren Was appointed by Tax
| Collector Sheehan without the approval
j of the Board of Supervisors, as required
\by law. When his demand, together with
those of eight deputies in the same pre
, dicament, were presented, approval was
j denied. Hence the application for the
! writ of mandate. ,
Judge Hebbard holds that the deputy
was illegally appointed, as were the oth
ers. The court denied the application for
| the writ, and his opinion reached even
I further, which has led to' wailing and
! gnashing of teeth in the offices of the As
| sessor and Auditor as well as that of the
â  Tax Collector. It was earnestly hoped
J by many politicians that the court would
decide otherwise. In fact, Judge Heb-
I bard received a letter from a prominent
i citizen, whose name he refuses to divulge,
' directly requesting the court to decide in
i favor of the deputy. The action of the
! writer of the letter is questionable, but
: whether any steps will be taken against
; him or not of course rests solely with the
I The decision, stripped of the above facts,
j rendered by Judge Hebbard reads:
It appears that of the appropriation of
i $30,000 made by the board in October, 1898,
I for the extra expenses of the Tax Collec-
I tor for the fiscal year from July 1, 1898, to
I July 1, 1899, there remains but the sum of
$1750. The Board of Supervisors, respond
ent herein, claims that the petition does
not state facts sufficient to warrant the
court in directing a writ to issue to com
! pel the board to approve the claim of pe
i titioner, and that the showing made by
respondent is a complete defense in this
proceeding. .'% , , . .
On March 25, IS6B, the Legislature passed
an act, section 1 of which is as follows:
"The Tax Collector of said city and
county shall be allowed, in lieu of the dep
uties and clerks now allowed by law, one
chief deputy and one cash deputy, each at
I a monthly salary of $200; three general
deputies, each at a monthy salary of $150;
also extra clerks at salaries at the rate
of $150 a month each for the time actually
employed; provided, said Tax Collector
shall not be allowed exceeding $12,000 for
| salaries of all such deputies and clerks
' during any one fiscal year.
"The Auditor of said city and county is
hereby directed to audit and the Treas
urer to pay in United States gold coin out
of the general fund of said city and coun
ty the several salaries herein provided
for. all demands therefor to (be first ap
proved and certified as correct by said
Tax Collector."
On March 30, 1872, the Legislature passed
an act which is in part as follows: "The
Board of Supervisors of the city and coun
ty of San Francisco are hereby authorized
and empowered to appropriate, allow and
order paid out of the general fund the
several sums of money hereinafter men
i tioned, and to exercise the following pow
ers, to wit: :'9*gS*
"To authorize the employment of such
extra clerks as may be required by the
Tax Collector in his office from time to
time at a salary not to exceed $150 per
month each."
"To allow and order paid out of the
general fund such sums as they may deem
absolutely necessary for extra assistance
in the office of Assessor, Tax Collector
and Auditor." . . - . / y -
The foregoing statutes are the only ones
cited or relied upon. The questions in
volved in this proceeding may be deter
mined largely from the language of that
portion of the act of March 30, 1872, which
is amendatory of the act of March 25, 1868.
Under the act of 1868 the Tax Collector
could appoint his extra clerks as well as
his regular force of deputies, and up to the
limit of $12,000. a year, could draw upon
the treasury through the Auditor for pay
ment of their salaries. The Board of
Supervisors had nothing to do or say. in
the matter. : But under the act of 1872 the
board was given power to authorize the
employment of the extra clerks and to
fix their salaries, not to exceed $150 per
month each, and to allow and order paid
such sums as they deemed absolutely
necessary for extra asistance in the office
of the Assessor, Tax Collector and Audi
tor, and to this extent the act took away
from the Tax Collector and gave to : the
Board of Supervisors : all power respect
ing the exercise of judgment and discre
tlon concerning the- necessity for extra
clerks, the authority to employ them and
the right to audit, allow and approve their
claims for services rendered. * *--
It is in evidence in this proceeding that
the Tax Collector never asked the board
to appoint petitioner an extra clerk:
that he never informed the board of his
appointment, and that the board did not
authorize his appointment.
â¢The petitioner relies much upon What
he claims has been the custom for many
years, in that the Tax Collector has al
ways apointed his extra clerks.
This is the first time the issue has
ever been raised between the " Tax Col
lector and the board, and the Clerk of
the board testifies that the Finance Com
mittee has always been advised when
ever the necessity for extra clerks has
arisen, and that there has always been
an understanding between heads of de
partments and the board. No doubt this
has been the custom.
Under the statutes relating to the
subject" it- is within the jurisdiction of
the Board of Supervisors, in the exer
cise of sound judgment, wise discretion
and with due regard for the necessities
of the head officers of the. various de
partments of the city and county gov
ernment on the one hand and the. rights'
of the taxpayers to have the public,
funds honestly and economically expend
ed on the other hand, to appoint these
clerks and see them paid.
- For these reasons â  alone the court can
not grant the relief demanded by peti
tioner in this proceeding. Further rea
sons which justify the court in refusing
to Issue the writ are found in the resolu
tions and orders of the Board of Super
visors of various dates, as follows: "No
extra clerks or employes shall hereafter
be employed in the public offices of this
city and county from and after this date
except in cases where the services of
extra clerks or employe's are on examina
tion deemed to be absolutely necessary
for the public Interest by the Finance
Committee of said board. "*
"Resolved, That the Finance Committee
is hereby required to take no application
for extra assistance unless the same be
In writing and unless the reasons are
specifically set forth therein.
"Each and every board, officer and de
partment of the city and county govern
ment are limited in their respective ex
penditures during each fiscal year to the
actual amount of money estimated as suf
ficient for such board, officer or depart
ment at the time of making the annual

of the city and county government for
the fiscal year to one-twelfth thereof each
month." â â ';-- :-' -'
And it appears from the evidence in
this proceeding that the sum of $30,000 was
appropriated for the expenses of the Tax
Collector's extra clerks for this fiscal
year. Of this sum $28,250 has already been
absorbed, leaving a balance of only $1750
for the last five months of the fiscal year,
a deficit of $10,750 according to the limita
tions of said order No. 126. The writ is
denied.
As the majority of clerks employed in
the offices of the Tax Collector, Auditor
and Assessor are what are called "extra."
the decision practically deprives those
offices of patronage and throws a great
opportunity into the hands of the Board
of Supervisors to pay several "political
debts." It is said that the matter will
be appealed to the Supreme Court, and
the disappointed ex-office-holders ex
pect to reverse Judge Hebbard's decision
before the higher court.
SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL
TEACHERS ARE WORRIED
APPBEHENSION CAUSED BY AS
SEMBLY BILL NO. 639.
Fear It Is Intended to Nullify the
- Civil Service Section of the
New Charter.
The woes of the San Francisco school
teachers are many, but as if the withhold
ing of their salaries until many of them
, are bankrupt In purse - and almost in
credit, and the turmoil and uncertainty
produced by the efforts of the new board
to undo the scandalous work of its pred
ecessor, were not enough to wreck their
nervous systems, along comes a new
cause for worry, and now the teachers
are sitting up nights trying to figure out
what will become of them if this thing
continues.
;, The latest bugbear to upset the equa
nimity of -the harassed employes of the
Board of Education is subdivision 6 of
section 1617 at Assembly bill No. 639. in
troduced In the Legislature by the Com
mittee on Education of the lower house,
to amend certain sections and to add one
new section to the Political Code relating
to the public schools of California. Sec
tion 1617 relates to the powers and duties
of trustees of school districts and boards
of education in cities, and the subdivision
which excites so much apprehension In the
breasts of the teachers reads as follows:
Sixthâ To employ the teachers, and imme
diately notify the County Superintendent of
Schools. in writing, of such employment,
naming the grade of certificate held by - the
teachers employed: provided, that on or before
the 20th day of : June of any year the Board
of School Trustees. or the city Board of Edu
cation shall meet and. by ballot, elect teach
ers for . the ensuing . school s year. Failure to
comply 'with .this provision shall continue the
teachers' last employed -in ' their positions -for
the ensuing: school " year, -arid ' In' the. event of
said teachers declining, to- be continued- In-s aid â¢
positions-; . it shall be the duty of the county
or city superintendent of Schools, respectively.''
to appoint teachers .to. 'fill -said positions .-for
the ensuing school year. .:. â¢ â¢:."'â -. .' â¢. L
The new charter provides that the
School Department of .San Francisco shall
be governed by civil service rules,: and the
teachers see in the proposed .amendment
an attempt oh .the part of sbm.e. one": to
nullify this, charter provision .and- place
them again at the mercy. of political ma
nipulators-, hence, their alarm. They are
preparing a vigorous protest against, the '
passage of the bill- as it stands, "and-.: ill

There is nothing .in this proposition that militates
a gainst the policy of; economy to which the Legisla
ture and the administration- are pledged .An appro
priation fpran exposition of the kind- proposed will
. 1 v. not so much an expenditure as art- investment. In
the! fcrst place, not one. dollar ot the amount asked for
will go outride the State: It is .not to be like the ex
penditure for the State display at Chicago, an. outlay
abroad.; but ah â investment a* home which will give "
employment to: home, labor '.and- make a- new demand
for many kinds home .products.
The investment' wdl pay from : the. start, for the
first result of it, even before, the exposition opens, will,
be an appropriation at Washington- of ; $500,000 â¢to be
expended in the State! - That in itself will be . a con
siderable addition to the money in circulation and
will "materially, aid in stimulating business. -and indus
try ; but it will be but a small." fraction of the amount
which 'will- be drawn into the channels. of local trade
by the enterprise. If., therefore,, we â  were to take ac
count only:, of the : sUms that will he brought to Cali
fornia, from the National Government, 1 from the va
rious States, and from, exhibitors from abroad^ the
income would be still so large as-to- amply justify. the
expenditure asked from the State to. promote, the
movement at -.the start. .
. ; The great, profit that is to be derived from the â in
vestment, however, is the far-reaching .effect it will
have upon California iii every part of her widespread
domain.. The astonishing change brought about in the
Southern States by the expositions- winch revealed to
Northern capitalists the resources of. that, section, of
the .country constitutes the most remarkable feature
.ef our industrial history for. the last five years. There
. :{ has been something like a- .revolution. in the South,
arid what was once a strictly agricultural section is
rapidly becoming.; a strong competitor of New Eng
.'land in the. manufacture of .cotton arid of " Pennsyl
vania in the manufacture of : iron..
'": There never was a time m pur. history more pro
â¢ pitious ; for -an investment in an exposition than that
which is now approaching. The Paris Exposition of
1000 will give a new stimulus to industrial and com
mercial/activity, and energetic men will be looking
for the best channels for trade with the Orient. If at
that time California invites the. world to consider her
.advantages for the Pacific Ocean commerce the profit
is sure' to be of incalculable value. It is, then, an in
vestment^ and not .an expenditure" that is asked from
the State' government, and as such the common sense
Â°of business , men will approve it. â

CANDIDATES DIFFERENTIATED.
IT is a fact that ought to sink deeply into the minds
of the intelligent citizens of this State and of their
legislative representatives that of all the candidates
for the Federal Senate Daniel M. Burns and Ulysses S.
Grant are the only two without a single qualification.
Except in weak political manipulation, the lives of
these two men, in their relation to the public, are
merely blanks. They are equally unknown in de
bate, in orator}', in the higher walks of business, or
in any single element that could possibly embellish
a Senatorial career. They have been as dumb as
oysters on every great political question. They have
shown no capacity for expression with the voice or
with the pen. They have no scholastic or literary
! standing. They have forced their candidacy, with
j utter disregard of any standard of intelligence, knowl
edge, experience or character, and in the face of a
million and- a half of people, evidently credited by
them with mental and moral stolidity, have dead
locked a hundred and nineteen legislative representa
tives, fresh from their constituencies.
There have been degrading struggles of conflicting
interests and ambitions upon low planes in other
States, but' none to compare with the situation at
Sacramento. Whether reaching to or falling below
the full measure of qualification for the highest sta- |
tion, within the gift of a State^every other candidate j
but these two has done something or has been some
body before the public eye. Senator Bulla has made
a respectable professional and legislative record.
General Barnes has tried great cases, delivered fine
orations and discussed important political issues.
Irving M. Scott has taken a leading part in the con
struction of mighty vessels of war, and has delivered
many addresses upon interesting topics. Thomas R.
Bard has been a successful leader in enterprise and
holds a strong business position. M. M. Estee has been
heard all over the State. He represented the Re
i publican party in joint discussions on the tariff with
Stephen M. White, and is also justly esteemed as a
vigorous writer and an able lawyer. Charles N. Fel
ton has been in each House* of Congress and mani
fested both ability and integrity. These Republican
gentlemen, who are all clean and distinguished, at
least in some degree, are over-weighted by Dan
Burns, who is not only destitute of merit, but has no
distinctive mark except the railroad brand, and by
Ulysses S. Grant, whose name is his sole capital, and
who. has achieved notoriety through his indiscreet
use of money.
This is a charming picture for the citizens of Cali
fornia to contemplate! It constitutes a fine parade of
our brains, our manhood and our dignity before the ]
Union and before the world! And, as if to add the '
last possible ingredient to the foulness of the seeth- j
ing caldron, a high Federal officer is reported as
having said that the only points he considers in the
choice of a Senator are geographical position and
the interests of his friend. We will reproduce the
language attributed between quotation marks to this
gentleman, so that the full measure of our humilia
tion may be accurately gauged:
"My position is simply that of a friend of Sen
ator Perkins. His following recognizes that it is for
his interest to have a Senator from the south this
time, so that the geographical situation would not be
inimical to him at the next election of a Senator.
We went to Grant on this account simply because he
seemed to have the most votes, but if Mr. Bulla or
any other southern man can get the prize we shall j
not cry over the result."
So the personality of Grant or of Bulla is of no
consequence! Their qualifications are immaterial! ]
But they both come from the southern end of the \
State, and, for that reason, whichever of them has ;
the most votes will command Federal support! The
people of California who furnish soldiers to the
Union and whose gifted sons are among the hon
ored of the earth, are expected to doff their pride,
abandon their self-respect and stand hat in hand be
fore " intellectual nonentity and moral obliquity
which for five weeks deadlock their Legislature at
the bidding of a railroad corporation, drunk with a
political success it did not gain, and of individual as
pirations regulated by geography.
Again we say of Burns and Grant, "A plague on
both your houses." Again we reiterate the vociferous
demand for the prompt election of a Republican, a
statesman and a gentleman.
DEFEAT THE VONDOLS.
SANTA BARBARA and other coast towns are
expressing great indignation over the intro
duction of a bill which if permitted to become
a law will work a serious hardship and mar the
natural beauty of the beach, utterly destroying any
attractions to tourists. Under the terms of this bill
Santa Barbara's water front would be an array of
unsightly derricks. If any profit accrued it would be
to a lot of vandal speculators. The proposition is so
unjust that we freely indorse the indignation of the
southern city, and hope the scheme will be defeated,
as it deserves to be. Probably it was introduced
without full realization of the mischief it would work
unless killed by the sober judgment of the legislators.
There is no occasion for the law outlined in this bill.
Even if oil could be found in paying quantity along
the beach, it could not be found in such quality as to
justify destruction of all the attractiveness which now
causes the south to be sought as a place for visiting
and for the erection of homes, many of them pala
tial. The citizens whose welfare is threatened are
circulating petitions denouncing the measure, and the
list of signatures is growing so fast as to indicate the
depths of feeling. It is apparent that any legislator
voting for the measure will do so at his political
peril.
In appearance the bill is innocent enough, but there
is a bug in it. It is entitled, "An act authorizing the
location and sale of mining claims upon public lands
of the State."
. "Such an act as this is unheard of," says the Santa
Barbara Press, after a careful analysis, "and exists in
no other commonwealth. It has within itself the
power to work confiscation on the upland owners of
lands bordering the ocean, who have, bought and im
proved their property with the ocean as its natural
boundary, and relying upon the protection of the
State and the understanding that it would be true to
its trust and hold the beach free for public use and
without the limits of private ownership, by permitting
obstructions and nuisances to be created in front of
their properties, rendering them comparatively value
less." j w â  ;â ..;.'., '^Z*
Which, being true, is a hint to the legislators to
oppose an aÂ£t which would be the authorization for
vandalism. -

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 1899.
PROSPECTS OF THE CANAL BILL.
WHILE the defeat in the House of the attempt
to attach the Nicaragua canal bill ,to the
sundry civil bill was a serious setback to the
j measure, it must not be regarded as an expression of
I the sentiment of the House on the merits of the en
| terprise. The motion was an unprecedented one in
[ parliamentary practice, and many genuine friends of
! the canal voted against it on the ground that the es
tablishment of such a precedent might result in evil
consequences.
The measure was not treated as a partisan one, and
party lines were not observed either during the de
bate or in the vote. Stalwart Democrats like Dockery
stood with stanch Republicans like Cannon in up
holding the decision of the chair against the pro
posed amendment, while the leadership of the fight
against the chair was taken by Grosvenor. of Ohio,
who is supposed to be the spokesman of the admin
istration in the House, and he was supported by
Bailey, the Democratic leader:
The debate brought out very clearly the fact that
the opposition was directed wholly against the man
ner in which the bill was presented, and not against
the bill itself. Dockery, for example, declared him
self in favor of the canal, because it would advance
commercial expansion, which he preferred to im
perial expansion, but he warned the Democrats that
if they set up the new rule they would sweep away
for all time a regulation which was established by
the fathers of Congress for the protection of mi
norities.
Cannon was equally emphatic in his declarations
in favor of the canal. In answer to a statement of
Grosvenor that the failure to pass the bill in the way
it was presented would be tantamount to an abandon
ment of the enterprise by the United States, he em
phatically maintained the opposite. His explicit as
sertions seem to have been convincing to Grosvenor
himself, for as soon as the vote was taken, which sus
tained the ruling of the chair, Grosvenor presented a
resolution fixing February 20 for consideration of
the Hepburn bill, with a vote on February 21.
The outlook for the passage of the bill at this ses
sion is therefore not altogether hopeless. Never
theless, it is unquestionable that the defeat is a
serious one, and that the chances of getting the bill
through are now slight. The time for adjournment
approaches rapidly, and there is much to be done.
Under such circumstances the friends of the measure
will be justified in making a fight for it even to the
extent of blocking all other legislation and forcing
an extra session. If they do that the people will sus
tain them. Better have three months more than
usual of Congressional talk than a year's delay in 1
such important measures as those now waiting for
action. 4
SENATOR SIMPSON has gone over to the
Burns camp. There is nothing surprising in
this. Those who have watched his career ex
pected that he would seek pastures where the grass
was longest.
Simpson has been a Bulla man. If recollection
serves us he had the honor of nominating that gen
tleman. The speech he made was so aimless and
rambling that no listener had any idea , where it
would end. As a climax he named Bulla, and had
been voting for him ever since.
But Simpson has gone over to join Jilson and
Wright, those twins of purity who took Grant money
before election and broke their contract early in the
deal. There has been no charge that Bulla bought
support, and hence the persistency of Simpson in
sticking to him has caused some surprise.
The first sign of wavering was when Simpson de
clared in favor of the caucus, in advocacy of which
Burns' touts have been expanding their lungs and
concentrating their energies. Then was apparent the
fact that he was weakening, that his devotion to
Bulla was a pretense, and while there is no ground
for the assertion that he was waiting for a bid, there
will be persons who will take this view of his flop.
Simpson is a weak character. He has at no time
displayed a sign of ability. On the floor he has been
silly and inane. His prohibition constituents would
be surprised at the heroic methods he adopted to rid
himself of the grip. A verbose and chattering light
weight, he has merely gone where he belongs and
where he has yearned to be. There is something
wrong with a man who proclaims that Burns is the
grandest Republican in California. Possibly Simpson
is paving the way for a plea of insanity.
I 7 HILE most of the cities and counties which a
WHILE most of the cities California winter a
few years ago made our California winter a
X * season of continuous gala days have for one
reason or another abandoned their fetes and festivals,
Sonoma continues to manifest the old-time joyous
ness, and Cloverdale arrays herself in glory and in
vites all the world to the enjoyment of her exposition,
her hospitality, her beauty and her climate.
This year everything has been unusually propitious
to the efforts made at Cloverdale to surpass all pre
vious attainments in the way of a midwinter fruit
festival. The weather has been as balmy as that of
the golden isles the poets dream of. While the
whole Eastern region of the country from the Rocky
Mountains to the Atlantic coast has been smitten with
snow and blasted with blizzards, California has been
breathing the perfume of flowers, the odors of ripen
ing oranges and living in the sunshine of halcyon
days.
Nowhere have the delights of the season been
more rare or more exquisite than in Sonoma, and
accordingly in preparing for the citrus fair the pe
plc have been animated with something of a frolic as
well as an earnest spirit. While designed primarily
as a display of the products of their industry, the oc
casion is to be made a festival as well as a fair. Re
ports tell us that the exposition pavilion is radiant
with floral decorations and is graced with exhibits
arranged with artistic taste ahd skill.
Cloverdale, in fact, is enjoying the gayest season
of her year, and Sonoma is in her glory. The city
and the country invite the world to see what California
can do in midwinter, and in' years that are unpro
pitious by reason of the lack of rain. The festival is
one that merits the attention of the whole country.
In no other land could such a fair be held at such a
season. As one of the few remaining midwinter fes
tivals it deserves a liberal patronage, and all San

SIMPSON, THE SLUMPER.
SONOMO IN HER GLORY.
THE PACIFIC COAST JOCKEY CLUB
SUCH la the announcement now placarding the deadwalls of the city and
being circulated by cards which touts and tipsters, vagrants and con
fidence men distribute with great glee, leaving on each the mark of a
thumb long unwashed. ''â  ; , , âÂ«âÂ«,;Â»
Nevertheless, The Call appears this morning, and even has clearly a.nnea
plans for coming out again to-morrow., Ever anxious to oblige, it feels useii

Although the matter is of little importance, perhaps an explanation would
not be amiss. This paper has recognized that racing as carried on in San ran-
Cisco is a potent source of ruin: that it has caused theft, suicide, murder; has
divided homes, has destroyed reputations and prospects. It has been sought to
set forth in these columns the truth about the matter, and the truth has hurt.
In warning business men not to allow their trusted employes to attend the
races, in trying to have enacted some law for the abatement of a sport which
has degenerated into a vicious nuisance. The Call has jarred the sensatHe
nerves of the gamblers, and they regard their return master stroke as a seda-
V In upholding the honor and weal of the public, necessity has arisen for mak
ing remarks involving the characters of D. M. Burns and of Moses Gunst. two
precious individuals who lend their active sanction to every form .gambling
in which there is a sufficient rake-off. These men are the frights of the track.
Their pockets bulge with the earnings of the men and women The Call desires
to protect. This fresh instance of the displeasure of the rogues at the drawing
of the halter cannot be viewed with surprise, nor yet regret. The rogues need
the halter, and this paper does not need their affection. --/.; âÂ»â¦>,â
They are welcome to plaster deadwalls, to scatter the cards even as the
sands of the sea for number, but they must not think the withdrawal of their
patronage has broken any hearts or changed any opinions. The continuous per
formance on the racetrack is still the peril to the community that it was before
this master stroke of the great minds who engineer the gulling of the people and
divide the loot, and a toga for Burns would be as marked a misfit as though he
heralded his gold brick schemes to the extent of pages daily.
The Call will continue the exposure of crookedness, the war on fraud, and
it does not ask either approval or support from bunko men. Neither is it im
pelled to tearful mood when a lot of gamblers solemnly express dislike for it.
and post in view of every eye the fact that they have been caught, and are real
mad about it.
THE ACT OF A TRAITOR
Senator Simpson of Pasadena voted for Burns on the
fifty-third joint ballot to-day, thus virtually acting the part of a
traitor, and breaking the solemn pledge entered into by the
Los Angeles County delegation not to withdraw support
from Mr. Bulla until the majority of the delegation should
so decide.
Mr. Simpson is also false to his constituents. Pasa
dena is for Bulla, first, last and all the time.
Mr. Simpson is false to Southern California, which de
mands that a Senator shall be chosen from the south.
He is false to the Republican party because he seeks to
fasten upon it the odium of electing such a man as Burns.
In the light of his vote to-day Senator Simpson has
acted the part of a hypocrite as well as of a traitor. Pre
tending to be the firm friend and supporter of Mr. Bulla, he
has deserted that gentleman at a critical period. His action
on its face is a plain endeavor to prevent a combination of
the anti-Burns and anti-Grant legislators, thus giving Mr.
Bulla, Mr. Barnes and the remaining candidates a possible
opportunity to triumph over the objectionable candidates.
Mr. Simpson can never explain away the consequences
of his treacherous act nor relieve Himself of the odium that
attaches to it. He has forfeited the respect of the people of
Southern California. He may eulogize Burns to the skies,
but his voice will come from the depths below.' â Sacra

GAS PRICES
MUST UNDERGO
INVESTIGATION
A Searching Inquiry
Will Be Made.
TO FIX THE CITY RATES
PRESIDENT CROCKETT MAKES
AN IMPLIED THREAT.
-
His Company Might Refuse to Sup
ply Gas if tne Bills Now-
Due Are Not
Paid.
The affairs of the San Franclco Gas and
Electric Light Company are to be venti
lated by the Supervisors after the manner
now being pursued in the case of the
Spring Valley Water Works.
This was determined yesterday by the
Finance Committee of the board. Chair
man Perrault was ready to proceed at
once, but Supervisor Collins, also of the
committee, will be out of town next week,
hence delay is necessary. The question
of the Inquisition developed through a
discussion before the Finance Committee
as to the disposal of the company's bills
for December, aggregating $26,700.
City and County Attorney Franklin K.
Lane was present, while President J. B.
Crockett and Attorney Rix represented
the interests of the gas company. Attor
ney Lane, in interpreting a decision ren
dered by Judge Hebbard, advised the com
mittee of three methods it could pursue.
First, the committee could hold the con
tract between the city and the company
valid and binding and approve the j de
mands under the contract; second, it
could hold It invalid and not binding and
vet pay the bills if the members thought
the figures reasonable; or lastly, they
could fix any figure they think reason
able. If this latter proposition does not
meet with the approval of the company
it has its recourse In law and can sue for
the value of the gas supplied.
Attorney Lane outlined these courses,
but declined to be placed in a position ad
vising what action should be pursued.
The representatives of the gas company
urged payment of the bills. Mr. Crockett
said that if a fight In the courts developed
it would tie up large sums of money. Un
der those conditions he said it would not
be reasonable for the company to go on
and light the streets. He maintained that
the board could not refuse to pay bills
and yet order the company to supply gas.
Mr. Lane called the attention cf Mr.
Crockett to his implied threat, and that
gentleman was quick to explain he did
not mean his remarks to be so understood.
The committee finally determined upon
an investigation. When Mr. Crockett
learned of its scope he said it would take
weeks and probably months to make the
exhaustive examination of the company's
books as outlined.
Although the investigation is nominally
to fix rates for gas supplied the city, it
may have a more far-reaching effect. If
It develops that the company can afford
to sell gas to the city at a low rate the
general consumers will demand that the
price charged them be reduced.^
The Street Light Committee of the
board, which has jurisdiction over this
matter, has not been consulted in the
premises, although any inquiry should,
properly, come within its jurisdiction.
Chairman Perrault is displeased at the
action of the Street Committee at its meet
ing Thursday in transferring $35,000 from
the street light fund to the street fund
proper. It is expected there will be a
struggle over the matter at the meeting
of the board on Monday. The Finance
Committee questions the right of the
Street Committee' to change funds and
claims that the matter should have been
passed upon by the Finance Committee.
The warrant of Homer Warren for work
performed in the office of Tax Collector
Sheehan was approved. This is the war
rant upon which suit was brought to com
pel payment of salaries of men employed
in the office.
The application of Mr. Sheehan for
clerks for March was referred to the
board without any recommendation.
ADOLPH SCHMID'S MURDER.
Al C. Flanders and Charles Forrest,
Arrested on Suspicion, Are
Released From Prison.
The murder of Adolph Schmid. who
was hacked with a hatchet in his room
815 Stockton street, will in all probabili
ty be classed among the mysterious trag
edies in the archives of the Police De
partment. . ; ?\ ~~ : '
From statements made by Schmid be
fore his death the police arrested Charles
Forrest, an ex-convict, and Al C. Flan
ders, master of the tug Millie. Schmid
stated that Flanders had a grudge against
him and on the morning of the assault
Flanders called at his room. Almost im
mediately after Flanders left Forrest and
another man, whom Schmid did not
know, came into the room and attacked
him with a hatchet.
o Both Flanders and Forrest denied
Schmid's assertions and claimed they
could prove an alibi. Flanders said he
had not seen Schmid for two months be
fore the assault and Forrest for "" two
weeks.
The evidence taken at the Coroner's in
quest was submitted to Judge Mogan and
after carefully examining it the Judge
notified the police yesterday morning that
it would be a waste of time to charge
Flanders and Forrest with the crime of
murder on the uncorroborated statement
of Schmid. Flanders and Forrest wer/
accordingly released from custody yeste^
; day morning. /

THE SAJST FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 18997
and was in the saloon about five minutes.
When he came out the case of whisky
and the two demijohns had disappeared.
The place where the robbery was com
mitted is about a block from the Califor
nia street station. Miesner at once re
ported his loss. " He states that the ser
geant in charge of the station told him
he was lucky not to lose his wagon and
showed him scant courtesy in the matter
of trying to locate the thieves. It is re
ported that several other robberies of the
same nature were committed the same
day in close proximity to the California
station , but none of the thieves were ap
prehended.

CALDWELL DID
NOT SEE GEYSER
AND LEFT HIM
Corrigan Horse a 1 to
5 Favorite.
BLUNDER SUITED THE BOOKS
MISS ROWENA ANNEXED AN
OTHER HANDICAP.
Racivan Once More a Startling Sur
prise â Beat Jinks and Others
at Long Odds â Fa
vorites Grew Weary.
Tales of woe without number filled the
air at Ingleside track yesterday at the
termination of the third event on the
card. Caldwell left Geyser standing still
at the post. It was the Corri^an horse's
first start this season, and a .soft spot
had been framed up for him so soft
that the ring laid but 2 to 9 against the
stake horse. Many a close figurer put
big money to draw down very little, and
It proved a severe blow to their finances.
The field was only a moderate sized one,
and at the post Jim Bozeman acted very
badly. Finally, in disgust, Caldwell re
leased, the barrier, intending that Hen
nessy on Bozeman should take chances
in getting away. He faile^ to observe
Martin astride the favorite turned the
reverse way, and as the field shot away
both were left. In a hard drive Chappie,
the second choice, reached the wire first,
a head before Distinction.
Aside from this, the sport was marked
by nothing eventful, unless it was the
victory of the rank outsider Racivan,
which defeated Jinks and others In a
sprint at odds of 40 to 1. Three favorites
in all suffered defeat.
The flying Miss Rowena made a superb
showing in the six-furlong handicap, for
which Aiiyar enjoyed first call in the bet
ting. Shouldering 118 pounds .and Joe
Piggott, she made the pace from the
jump, and, driving hard, led the favorite
out a neck in 1:14^4. Highland Ball came
with a rush at the end, finishing lapped
on the leaders.
The smart ones figured that there was
nothing to the fifth event, at five
and a half furlongs, but Jinks, and
Dunne's filly went into Caldwell's
hands a 7 to 10 choice. Ach held
her safe into the stretch and looked
to be winning, when Rutter hustled Ra
civan along, and the outsider responded
with a vim, defeating Ach over two
lengths. Jinks showed none of her old
time speed.
A three-furlong scramble for two-year
olds opened the afternoon's sport, and
proved a gift for Corrigan's filly Sardine.
She had r 'Skeets" Martin in the saddle,
and, starting a prohibitive favorite, won
all the wav Tn romping fashion. Winyah,
from Ezell's stable, excellently ridden by
Hennessy, took the place from Mounte
bank.
An Immense field of maidens, seventeen
in all, started in the five-furlong sprint
next decided. Elsin ruled an 11 to 5 favor
ite and experienced little difficulty in lead
ing the bunch out. Watossa was first
into the stretch, but tired badly near the
close, being beaten out for second place
by Florence Fink.
"With Paul Griges and the best ones
scratched from the mile and a sixteenth
selling affair, nothing was left to give
Ferrler an argument. Hobart's horse
faced the barrier a 11 to 20 choice and
won without effort. Cabrillo made all the
running, and fighting it out gamely took
the place by a head from Judge Wofford.
Track Notes.
Yellow Tall, the crack two-year-old of
the Burns & Waterhouse string, has
changed hands. Some days ago Fred
Foster, the owner of Dr. Rice, Dr. Shep
pard, Sam McKeever and others, asked
Mr. Waterhouse to set a price on the
youngster. On Thursday Mr. Waterhouse
said $10,000 would buy him, and to his as
tonishment the offer was accepted, and
Foster at once proceeded to tender a
check to bind the sale. Yesterday the
stable reluctantly turned the handsome
colt over to his new owner. Yellow Tail
started but three times and on two occa
sions earned brackets,* his victories being
most impressive ones.
Fly, the fast sprinter owned by Hanlon
Bros., died on Thursday, having burst a
blood vessel. He was bred by \ the de
ceased turfman, By Holly.
Fred Chase and Wallace Wendenhall
have succeeded the old firm of Klllip &
Co. The new firm will continue in the
pool selling and auction business. Both
gentlemen are popular with all classes of
horseman and should do a lucrative busi
ness. . â â â¢â .-.'.
' W. 08.. Macdonough, famous in the
turf world as the owner of Ormonde, was
a visitor at the track yesterday. . He was
much interested in the two-year-olds by
his great horse, now being galloped at
the track. /
Ed Games figured Racivan a chance and
made a mild clean-up over the outsider's
win. ' ':

Demartini's Nemesis.
Gladys Matheney, the young woman
who has been making the life of Victor
Demartini, the Italian interpreter, mis
erable for the past two years, appeared
before Judge Graham yesterday on the
charge of ' vagrancy. She had demanded
a jury trial, but after reflection in the
City Prison she told the Judge yesterdfcy
that she would agree to leave the c#y
and not trouble Demartini again. The
Judge released her on the condition that
she would depart within three days, and
if she should show her face again here
within a year she would be promptly ar
rested and sent to jail for six months.

What Is Friction? ; .
It is one of the natural laws which pre-
vents an old style ball-touch-ball bearing '
from revolving at a higher rate of speed
than 13,000 revolutions a minute. . It is
also a natural law that admits of. the new Cleveland ball and ,
roller bearing revolving 35,000 revolutions a minute without
1 heating. "Twice as easy" well describes the running of the
Cleveland cycle fitted with these bearings.
Can Yon Keep Out of the Dust?
Every ball and roller bearing is protected by a combina-
tion rawhide and felt washer. A ton of dust would, never
affect these bearings. They are absolutely dust-proof. -J.

Life's Vanished Joys
are the continual source of misery to those who j
suffer from nervous debility and prostration j
i They never cease mentally comparing them- i
selves with the rosy-cheeked women or stalwart
men that come In their way.
GLOOM, FOKGETFULNESS AND ;
DESPAIK sometimes drive them to insanity,
or else into the grip of some chronic ailment
like consumption. Vitality being crushed in ,
them they merely endure llfo. THEY DO
NOT REALLY LIVE!

BRADSTREETS FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Feb. 17.â Bradstreefs Financial j
Review to-morrow will say Reopening on ,
Tuesday, after a three days' recess, to find
mail and railroad communication Interrupted ;
by the storm, and the attendance In Wall
street seriously reduced, the stock market de- i
veloped unexpected strength. This, in fact, j
continued to be its chief feature throughout j
the rest of the week, though the total trans- '
actions were rather below the recent level and '
there was at first much more evidence of pro- '
fessional than of public support. More or less j
commission house purchasing was attracted |
within the last day or so by the steadiness and
advancing quotations, but the market as a !
whole had the appearance of following the lead j
of manipulators to a greater extent than has ;
been witnessed since last autumn. The inter- ;
est of the street was centered mainly on a few j
stocks In which influence of the kind just re
ferred to were conspicuous, Burlington being |
the principal feature, while the Pacific- and i
some others came in for more or less atten
tion of a 'sinjHar character. There were few
developments calculated to Influence specula- :
tion. Rumors, were, however, plentiful, and ]
had 'much, to do with the movement in the
active securities. There was a decided dispo
sition to .accept any favorable intelligence or
views; and the street, apparently, made up its
mind to disregard any adverse Incidents, such
as' the Interruption of general business and t
railroad traffic by. the storm or the damage
which it may have done In the "South or other
sections. On the other hand, It seemed to be
accented as a proved fact that the liquidation .
of weak' speculative accounts tnat has been in J
progress since the latter part of January had t
exhausted Itself, and that the continued ease j
of money- was calculated to cause renewed pur- '
chases, even If the Investment demand has |
been .largely satisfied. London sales of our |
securities haÃ slackened largely, it would j
seem, because the supply is exhausted, but ;
every incoming steamer still brings large con- .
signments of securities, principally of dividend- |
paying stocks standing In the names of foreign j
investors. This mass of securities adds to the
floating supply in Wall street and causes In- ;
creased borrowing, but no effect either on tho ]
abundance of supplies of money or on the cur- !
rent rates of interest can be observed. In 1
fact, the disposition which existed in some
.quarters to look on a tightening of the finan
cial situation as among the possibilities of the j
Immediate future has measurably subsided.
Unfavorable comment is naturally heard re- |
garding the rapidity with which new indus
trial combinations are formed and the vast ;
increase in the amount of securities of such
concerns. It seems, however, that the conser
vative way in which they are treated in finan- !
cial circles tends to lessen any danger from
that source, and speculation in them is largely- j
confined to outright purchases of the securi- j
ties. Good railroad earnings continue to be
the rule, and the street has been encouraged to !
look for some extremely favorable results in â 
regard to net earnings as an effect of the pres
ent maintenance of rates and the adherence of |
the companies to established tariffs. The prin
cipal speculative influences, of the week have
thus been bullish, and though some of the lead- ;
ers are inactive, the Interests which took a i
position on the long side have found ample |
following among the smaller professionals and i
the large section of the public which the recent
strength of the market has brought, perma
nently It would appear, back Into Wall street.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, Feb. 17.â R. G. Dun's Weekly
Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
Beyond question business is expanding and
in many branches it is larger, notwithstndtng
speculative combinations which tend to reduce
It. All monopolies or attempted monopolies*
stimulate business while they are coming, but
tend to stifle It after they come, and the throng
of combinations and trusts which have been
formed or proposed has given a temporary
but very questionable Impetus to trade. But
beyond the influence of these there is a genu
ine and substantial enlargement of business I
due to the unexampled prosperity of a grow
ing population.
The week's output of plgiron February 1 was
237,639 tons, against 243,516 January 1, and 23.".,
--521 December 1. The average weekly produc
tion thus indicated was about 1000 tons greater
In January than in December, and the unsold
stocks were reduced 43.671 tons In January,
against 37,449 In December, so that the appar
ent consumption In manufacture was in Janu
ary 1.110.079 tons, against 1,098.176 in Decem
ber. The stoppage of several lurnaces for
necessary repairs at a time when the demand
is almost pressing has caused some fear of
famine, although quite a number of furnaces '
have started since February 1, or are about to
start. Plgiron has advanced, but the largest
consumption ever recorded in any month is in
part due to the hasty purchases of products
about to be controlled or advanced in price
by a combination. There are so many of these
in the iron and steel industry that the present
market does not clearly Indicate the magnitude j
of the demand, and disappointment in some i
branches is not imorobable. But the rise of .
$1 in steel rails, with the entire capacity of
all .works engaged until after July 1. Is not !
unnatural, nor Is the strength of plates, the
legitimate use for which is beyond all prece
dent, and the same is true of bars, the quan
tity required for cars, railway and agricultural
works being enormous. In pipe the associa
tion lifted prices five per cent, with a very
heavy order from Indiana gas works.
No fictitious demand has caused the rise in
grain, for the exports continue so heavy In
wheat and corn that the advance of 3% cents
in wheat Is abundantly Justified, and the rise
of % of a cent in corn seems scarcely enough
for the occasion. Atlantic exports have been
retarded by the blizzard, but have been 2.265,
--615 bushels, flour Included, against 3.142.057 last
year, and for the crop year thus far the ex
ports. Including flour, have been 156,787,740
bushels, against 143,714.142 last year. When It
Is remembered that the exports of corn are al
most as large as the largest ever known there
Is reason for astonishment at the continued
foreign demand. That it persisted in spite of
the strong advance in prices here since Septem
ber 1 is most encouraging. It Is obviously im
possible to Judge how far it may go. There is
much inquiry for wool, and the manufac
turers have a larger demand for heavyweight
goods, but they maintain that they cannot pay
prices now demanded, and most of the pur
chasers made appear to have been at some
concessions. Sales at the three chief markets
were 6,160,200 pounds, which is about the I
weekly consumption with Eastern mills well
employed, but they were partly on speculative
account, and In fine and fine medium territory
sales are mentioned at 40 cents cleaned and in
Ohio XX at 26 cents and upward.
The minor metals have been running weaker j
with a reduction in London, although the in
dustries have shown no abatement -of tfÂ»mand >
In this country, and the rise in prices here is
largely due to increased consumption.
Failures for the week have been 176 in the
United States, against 295 last year, and 18 in
Canada, against 35 last year. ,--v; ; .. 'â â %
BRADSTREETS ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK, Feb. 17.â Bradstreefs to-mor- I
row will say:
Following the long continued cold wave, cul- !
minating In heavy snow and sleet storms and
Inclement weather generally throughout nearly
all sections of the country, come reports of re
viving spring trade and of efforts to ascertain
the extent to which material Interests have
suffered. All things considered, the damage
so far Indicated, while serious in some sec
tions, has proved less than might have been
expected in view of the. severity of the visita
tion. .Exception is of course made in the case
of the winter wheat. crop, from which trust
worthy reports as to damage - are - not forth
coming at this early period of the year. - From
the â  South come reports of more serious dam
age, particularly to the growing fruit and
vegetable . crops. Even here, however, per
manent damage, aside from the reported loss
of the unpicked cotton, seems to be centered
in the States of Georgia, Florida . and Louisi
ana. Satisfactory reports of a resumption of
spring distribution come .from the .West, in
duced by a considerable rise : in temperature,
and a good volume of business Is reported in
the East and in the Middle States as a result
of the receipt of delayed i mail orders, though
transportation is still Interfered with. Re
ceipts of livestock have been checked at West
ern ' centers, . but â¢ estimates of losses of cattle
do ~ not much exceed 15 per cent, ranging
downward .to as â¢ low as 8 per cent, and this
only in the case of cattle ! on the â¢ ranges. I A
satisfactory business appears ' to be doing on
the Pacific Coast, and export business is fairly
active. San Francisco reports a conservatism

among merchants on account of the dry
weather. Relief is hoped for. . however, from ;
the usual spring rains. Business in wool has ]
naturally been quiet, but Boston reports large
transactions in foreign wools pending. Among
the industries iron and < steel - are still ex
tremely active and further advances are re
ported, shared in by sympathetic gains in cop- |
per and spelter. Consumers of plgiron who j
delayed covering their wants are reported ;
anxious regarding: supplies of materials. A
regretable feature from one point of view Is
the reported growing indifference on the part :
of the American producers toward export j
though excuse for this is found in the fact j
that domestic demand is sufficient to keep j
them fully employed. Shipbuilding is likely
to be very active and reflection or this demand i
is found in the urgent inquiry for steel plates :
at a number of centers. While the demand for I
and movement of t lumber has been interfered I
with the strength of prices Is unimpaired.

Harrison's circular says: . "During the week
there have been six arrivals of coal from Wash
ington with 9711 tons; four from Oregon, 1945
tons; one from British Columbia, 2000 tons; two
from Australia, 5971 tons: total, 19.627 tons.
Although the quantity : at hand is about one
half the amount received last week, yet the
needs of all are fairly well supplied, as the
warm weather this week has cut down the con
sumption for household purposes fully 60 per
cent. When the Honolulu contracts for British
Columbia coals shall have been shipped, there
will be no difficulty In having this market
promptly supplied from that section. â¢If this
dry weather should continue for a few weeks
longer, there may probably be some marking
up of values, as coal . freights from Australia
and Great Britain will assuredly advance. There j
being no business awaiting them on arrival
here, ship owners will surely avoid this port.
They will not name any reasonable freight j
rates at present, awaiting the rains to declare
themselves. < Our coast colliery proprietors J
naturally avail themselves of the higher cost I
of competing foreign fuel and act accordingly
by- raisings prices. This applies only to coals
for steam uses, as there is no likelihood â  of
any change of quotations for domestic grades.
Another dry season would ' prove fatal also to
the coal trade. Although the prices to steam
producers would be higher, the quantity con
sumed would be materially diminished. The
outlook for the moment is certainly discourag
ing, although there Is ample time yet to save
our crops."

TWO MEN MEET VIOLENT
DEATHS AT THE CLIFF
George Wolf.
TWO men met violent deaths at the cliff near Signal Point yesterday and
their dead bodies were found lying within a hundred yards of each other.
George Wolf, a tailor, 63 years of age, committed' suicide by shooting
himself in the head, and an unknown man fell, from the cliff and was so
badly cut and crushed by the stones that death must have been Instantaneous.
George Wolf resided at 6368 Natoma street with his wife. He. had been
out of work for some time, and despondency over financial troubles Is sup
posed to be his reason, for suicide. His body was found on a rock part way ,
down the cliff, and it is believed that It was his intention to throw himself
Into the water after shooting himself. His intention' miscarried, as he fell
backward Instead of forward. The pistol was not found, and probably fell
into the water. Wolf left a letter to his wife, telling her that he was going
to end his life, and that she would never see him again.
The body of the unknown man was found by Frank Farran in the surf at'
the foot of the cliff. The deceased had evidently fallen from the top of the
cliff. His head was badly cut toy the rocks, and his ribs were broken. After
the fall the tide dashed the body against the rocks, causing other cuts. Dr.
Cabala performed an autopsy last night and found that hemorrhage of the
internal organs, resulting from the blows on the body, caused the man's
death. A silver watch, smashed to pieces, was found on the beach, and this
was all which the dead man had on his person. He wore a black sack coat,
brown vest, brown hat, striped cotton shirt and heavy boots.
PERRAULT TO
RESIGN HIS
CHAIRMANSHIP
Wants to Retire From
Active Work.
SEIZED ALL THE PATRONAGE
HIS JOB LOST ITS CHARMS WHEN
HIS FRIENDS WERE PLACED.
r. Â» .
He Says He May Not Go Out Until
the End of the Fiscal Year.
Scramble for His Job
Expected.
â  â  .
Supervisor Eduard L. Perrault is about
to retire from active duties of the Board of
Supervisors and if the storm raised is not
too' high will resign the chairmanship
of the Finance Committee.
This announcement, made quietly, cre
ated a sensation around the City Hall
ve3terday. It has been known for some
time that Dr. Perrault was, to say the
least.unpopular. His chairmanship of the
Finance Committee gave him a monopoly
of the patronage and he succeeded in
boosting many of his friends into fat lit
tle sinecures. Others who had a hungry
favorite or two watched his actions and
their eyes grew greener. But Dr. Per
rault was chairman of one of the most
important committees, and a Czar in
miniature, and to secure his direct antag
onism would mean digging- a political
grave and lying down quietly in it for the
next year or two.
Now the offices are all filled. Hungry-
Jack Homers have taken all the fat,
Juicy little plums and wink knowingly
When Dr. Perrault passes by. As soon as
he has succeeded the wily politician an
nounces bis intention of resigning from
the- chairmanship, thus to leave the big
work and no direct patronage for another.
This has caused the prophecy that next
campaign the. doctor will be a dead one.
When seen last night he made no de
nial of the statement, but said that he
would talk the matter over fully with
other members of the board. If there are
enough strings to hold him where he is
for the present he will not overwork him
â self, but will positively resign at the
close of the fiscal year in June.
Although the best part of the patronage
i 3 cone, there will be a scramble for Dr.
Perrault's place for the chairman of the
Finance. Committee, even though he may
not be able to help a weary heeler up the
ladder, can still do many a good turn for
his friends. . , . ..
Supervisors have not been slow to tell
friends on the" outside that the doctor has
controlled matters with a high hand. His
word is law. They claim he acts without
consulting them in many matters, but is
jealous of his own rights when any one
presumes on them.
Notorious Slave Dealer Jailed.
Deong Quan Sing, one of the most noto
rious of the Chinese slave importers, was
brought before United States District
Judge de Haven yesterday on a bench
warrant for the purpose of having his bail
increased. . Leong had been indicted by
the Federal ' Grand Jury on a charge of
importing Chinese women Into California
for improper purposes, and the evidence
on the preliminary examination was over
whelming. He was released pending his
trial on the ridiculously small bail of $300.

FATHER AND MOTHER
FIGHT FOR A CHILD
CHEATED A SCENE NEAR THE
AG ASSIZ SCHOOL.
The Prompt Appearance of a Police
man Put a Temporary Stop
to the Trouble.
The sight of a father attempting to drag
his child away from its mother's arms
created a great deal of excitement in
front of the Agasslz School on Bartlett
street, between Twenty-second and
Twenty-third streets, . yesterday after
noon. - ' yy "-
The trouble between the couple, Mr.. and
Mrs. de Bonnet,. is of long standing, and
has arisen to the dignity of a scandal in
the Mission. "-Both parties are well to do,
and De Bonnet claims to be connected
with the crowned heads of Europe.
About two years ago husband and wife
separated, Mrs. de Bonnet going to live
with her mother, Mrs. Pollard, at Twen
tieth and Mission streets., At the open
ing of the last school year Mrs. Pollard
senior brought a child to the Agassiz
School and requested the principal to
have his name entered on the books as
Pollard, saying that she did not wish to
have him bear his father's name. She
also gave instructions that the boy be
only permitted to go home with its
mother, or some one designated by her.
The instructions were faithfully car
ried out, but yesterday afternoon the
father visited the school and requested
to see his child. The mother heard of it
and asked Sergeant Perrine of the Sev
enteenth street station to detail a man at
the school. In explanation she said that
she feared for the life of herself and
child, as Mr. de Bonnet had threatened to
disfigure them both. : ..,.
The officer concealed himself in the vi
cinity of the school and awaited develop
ments. When Mrs. de Bonnet came out
with the boy the ' husband suddenly
rushed forward, stuck one hand in â¢ his
hip pocket and started to drag the boy
away with the - other. The policeman
then appeared on the scene and. ordered
him to go home quietly and leave the
child with its mother. He at once said
he would, and permitted the officer to
search him. It was found that he car
ried neither a gun nor a bottle of vitriol,
but further trouble is expected, and it
is probable that the school will again be
watched Monday. - .â -"<: â â¢'â ;

charged by the captain of the Alice
Blanchard for not having prepared break

LEAPED FROM THE

ARMS OF DEATH
Tragic Suicide of J.
W. Tracey.
HE WAS DETERMINED TO DIE
A BRAVE OFFICER OF THE CORO
NA RESCUES THE BODY.
Wild Consternation on Board â
Hapless Deputy Sheriff De
spondent Through Aber
ration.
J. W. Tracey, a deputy Sheriff of this
city, committed suicide shortly after 1
o'clock on Thursday afternoon by plung
ing Into the ocean from the northbound
steamer Corona on her way from San
; Diego to San Francisco, about an hour
i after leaving Port Harford.
j Deputy Tracey had gone down to Whlt
i tier with some prisoners on the preceding
I southbound trip of the Corona, and had
acted very strangely on that occasion,
being missing at one time for such a long
period that the officers of the vessel were
notified and search, was made. "When
found he could not make any explanation
beyond saying that he had been "think
ing."
On the return trip his mind seemed more
at ease. He had been chatting with Mr.
I Nash', the chief officer, when he suddenly
! excused himself and started for his state
| room. Mr. Nash inquired what he was
; going to do, and Tracey replied, "I was
, just thinking," and passed on to his room.
Shortly afterward some passengers
standing on the starboard deck near his
stateroom door saw him steal out of the
room in his underclothes. Upon seeing
them he immediately went in again.
Their attention was diverted for an in
stant, and in that 'moment he stepped
again from his room and plunged directly
overboard. He came to the surface and j
struck out instantly in good shape.
In spite of the great confusion which
prevailed, a small boat was lowered al
most immediately from the still moving
vessel, which was swung around to re
turn to the place where Tracey could
plainly be seen swimming. ,â¢
The water was so smooth the small
boat could be easily managed, but so
skillfully was the Corona handled that in
spite of the fact that she was going ahead j
full speed when the accident occurred she
got back to where Mr. Tracey was swim
! ming before the small boat could reach |
him, the bow of the vessel passing within i
| twenty feet of him. Life buoys and ropes
were thrown to him from the vessel.
Tracey was swimming with cool, regular
| strokes, apparently mechanically, until he
j saw the hull of the vessel loom up near
j him and a buoy landed within a few
inches of him. Then he seemed to realize j
that the act of desperation which he had i
deliberately committed, and which the
shock of the water had driven from . his
mind, was about to be undone. He drew
j his hands back from the buoy and delib
erately turned his face down into the
water, apparently making no further ef
fort to save his own life.
Seeing that the body was going to sink
I before the small boat could reach It, the
j second officer, Mr. Zeh, jumped over
board, half dressed, and with no life line, ;
I taking the chances of being drowned by
the death grasp of the now entirely un- i
i conscious man, Zeh grabbed Tracey, a line
was thrown to him and he was dragged
with his burden Into the small boat, From
there they were hoisted to the saloon
Every effort was immediately made to
resuscitate the unfortunate Tracey by Dr.
W. J. May and another of the passengers.
L. D. Tandy, engineer of the "General
Electric Company, who has had consid
erable experience with reviving people
after electric shocks, using the D Arson
ville method of artificial respiration.
After working for nearly an hour the
hopeless task was abandoned and the
| body was laid out in one of the state
rooms. , i. "i ':".!_ â 
The wildest excitement prevailed on
'â  board the Corona, and the passengers
! stood around in groups the rest of the
day discussing the occurrence from every
possible standpoint.
No information could be obtained from
any of Tracey's fellow-travelers as to his j
mental condition. â  Chief Officer Nash, who j
! was the last one who talked with him, !
I did not notice anything unusual In his !
1 manner, but some of his friends In this ;
i city say that he' had been subject to epi
i leptic seizures, which had made him very |
i despondent, He was in the habit of
â drinking heavily and having fits of de
' pression as a result, and he had also been
worrying about his business affairs lately, i
He had been employed as a deputy un
der ex-Sheriff "Whelan, and had been given j
intermittent work under the new regime,
but he feared that this was only tempo- j
rary, although those in the office "with
him say .there was no danger of bis being
deposed, as he was both popular and effl-
Upon the arrival of the steamer Corona
yesterday morning at 8 clock the body
was removed to the Morgue and from
there to the rooms of the United Under
takers " " "" -~- - â 
After the Inquest the body was taken to I
the residence of a relative, Mr. McClellan,
lat Fifteenth and Castro streets. The
I funeral will be held from there _
Mr Tracey was a widower, with 'wo
' children. He had been living with ms
! sister, who will retain the care of the
children for the present.

SAILORS PROTECTED.
The Amended Law to Go Into Effect
Next Monday.
The United States Shipping Commis
sioners have received a notification
; from Washington that the amended sail
| ors' allotment law would go into effect
next Monday. The law is designed to
protect deep-water sailors from the ray-
I ages of boarding-house keepers and other
' land sharks, and it limits the amounts of
claims that may be made against a sail
| or's advance money or wages by real or
pretended creditors. Â«_.Â«__.
The amended law provides that between
ports of the United States on the Pacific
' Ocean and American or foreign ports on
i the Atlantic or Indian oceans, the allot
: ment shall not exceed twenty days' pay.,
Heretofore' it has been from $30 to $40.
Between ports of the United States on
the Pacific Ocean and ports of the Pa
cific west of the hundred and eightieth
meridian or south of the equator, and
Asia, Australia and New Zealand the al
lotment must not exceed fifteen days' pay.
It ranged formerly from $2o to $30. Be
tween ports of the United States on the
Pacific Ocean and foreign ports on the
Pacific east of the hundred and eightieth
meridian and north of the equator the al
lotment must not exceed ten days' pay.
Sailors on coasting vessels are aireaay
protected by a separate law.

Surmosed Show-Window Bobbers.
Silas Leowcr and Gerald Richardson
were arrested yesterday, by Detectives
Ryan and ODea on suspicion of having"
robbed the show window of Goldstein &
Cohn. 822 Market street, of the.Elntracht
Club prizes on Wednesday â¢ morning.
Loewer was taken' at the corner, of Pine
and Kearny streets and had tucked under
his vest four pairs of opera glasses which
he had taken from a show window at 310
California street. It is supposed that
Richardson assisted in both crimes.
Against Cheap Bricklayers.
'At the regular meeting of the San Fran
cisco Bricklayers' Association held . on
Wednesday evening, February 15, the fol
lowing resolutions were adopted:
"Whereas, There was an article pub
lished in some of the daily papers on the
7th inst., by .the International Bricklay
ers' Union, calling the attention of the
public to the carpenters setting terra
cotta. on the Hall of Justice and claim
ing that the San Francisco Bricklayers'
Association was organized for the benefit
of the Master Masons, and was not an
organization of journeymen;
"Resolved, i That the San Francisco
Bricklayers' Association is the only bona
fide bricklayers' union in this city, with
branches in Oakland, San Jose and Sac
ramento, and is recognized as such by all
the architects and legitimate contractors
in San Francisco, having been organized
since 1882 with a standard of per day,
which we still maintain.
"Resolved. That we call the attention
of all mechanics to the work on said
building to show that the International
Bricklayers' Union does not consist of
competent men, and we deplore the fact
that the contractor of said public build
ing saw fit to employ cheap and incom
petent bricklayers and refused the mem
bers of our association, who pay taxes,
the privilege of working on said build
ing.'"

AN EXCELLENT COMBINATION.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well-known remedy,
Syrup of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Company, illus-
trates the value of obtaining the liquid
laxative principles of plants known to
be medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to
the taste and acceptable to the system.
It is the one perfect strengthening lax-
ative, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly, and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make It the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
arte used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Company only. In order to get its ben-
eficial effects and to avoid imitations,
please remember the full name of the
company, printed on the front of every
package.

labors with his scientific examination of
the prosecution's experts. Dr. Buteau,
an old-time physician, was on the stand
many hours and appeared rather to enjoy
what resembled a clinical lecture. The
jurors were at first interested, then bored
and finally tired with the long, big word
ed and not always explicit queries and
answers.
There are, however, two lives hanging
on the evidence to be adduced from the
skull which has been carefully preserved
from the time it was stolen from the
murdered girl's coffin at the Berkeley
Morgue. It has not yet been introduced
In evidence, but it. is promiseu for the
proper time. The defense, both at the
preliminary examination and at the trial,
has attempted to get all the experts for
the prosecution so definitely on record in
regard to all the details, so that they may
hope to overturn the evidence by the con
dition of the skull itself. So confident
do Brandes' attorneys appear of securing
a favorable verdict based on the condl
! since the disease first* appeared in the

TO COMPROMISE ON
ARMY REORGANIZATION
Republican Leaders Start a Move
ment Intended to Prevent an
Extra Session.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17.â There was a
pronounced movement in the Senate to
day looking to a compromise on the army
reorganization bill. The movement orig
inated with several Republican Senators,
who advanced the opinion that a compro
mise was preferable to an extra session
of Congress. The Cockrell bill was ac
cepted by them as the first advance on the
part of the Democrats toward an under
standing, and many felt they would go
farther In that direction in case the Re
publicans should indicate a willingness to
meet them half way. - The movement
grew wholly out of the desire to avoid a
special session and was participated in
by some of the Republican leaders.
"When the matter was brought to the
attention of Senator Hawley, chairman
of the Committee on Military Affairs, he
gave it" no countenance whatever, declar
ing that he was not willing to yield any
thing. He was critical of the Cockrell
bill finding especial fault with its pro
visions for natives of the new possessions
In the American army. He announced his
purpose to stand by his notice to call up
the bill reported by the Republican mem
bers and insist on consideration on that
baois, and that only.

Otto E. Yon Rhein Will Sue His Wife
for Divorce on the Ground
. of Desertion.
Otto E. yon Rhein, son of the well
[ known real estate dealer, will enter suit
! to-day against his wife Ida for divorce
on the ground of desertion.
Mrs. yon Rhein was formerly Miss Ida
A. Son, daughter of A. A. Son. Announce
ment of her engagement to Yon Rhein
was made about the first of October, 1897.
1 Her parents were somewhat opposed to
: the marriage, and decided to send her
i abroad before it could be consummated.
Cupid was not to be thwarted in this
way, however, and the two were secretly
i married on October 12. 1897. On the 30th
: of the same month the bride went to Eu
; rope and took her secret with her. While
! there the secret of the marriage leaked
I out and the parents of the couple held j
, a consultation, at which it was decided
i that a dissolution of the marriage bonds
I would be satisfactory to all parties. Mrs.
i yon Rhein returned to this country last
February, but did not .go back to her
j husband. She will not oppose the suit.

INSANE WOMAN'S WEALTH
SEWED IN HER HIP PADS
OAKLAND. Feb. 17.â Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Brady, who was found wan
dering about the streets last night, Is detained at the Receiving Hos
pital for insanity. This morning she turned over to Insane Keeper
Keating a pair of curious hip pads, in the lining of which was sewed
up $1400 in $20 gold pieces, which she requested be kept where her husband
cannot get at the money. Each of the pads was square in shape, made
of plain black cloth, and the twenties were sewed in very tight, some
singly and in some Instances fiv together, making a most costly as well
as weighty adornment for the female figure. Mrs. Brady says she saved
these twenties one by one.
Mrs. Brady Is about 70 years old, and together with her husband, Jim
Brady, has resided at Dutch Slsft for the past forty-five years. She
arrived in this city last Wednesday evening, but it has not been learned
where she stopped.. \. 7. ; :f . - '- . - â 
To Drs. Childs and Mauzy, who partially examined her for insanity
to-day, she stated that her husband has on several occasions tried to poi
son her, once pouring a cup full of iodine into her mouth while she was
asleep. She stated, also, that since arriving in Oakland an old sea captain
has been following her about, to her great annoyance.
During the day Mr. and Mrs. John Nichols called on the unfortunate
woman at the hospital. They scoff at her statements as to her husband's
alleged threats, and expressed much surprise over the fact of so much
money having been 'found in her possession. Mr. Brady has been advised
by telegraph of his wife's arrest, and is expected to arrive to-night.

tion of th* skull that they have conceded
many points usually considered material
to the prosecution.
This afternoon Attorney Bennett asked
Dr. Buteau a question which practically
amounted to an insinuation that the wit
ness was a liar. He asked him if he did
not testify to certain conditions of the
heart to bear out a condition of asphyxia
tion and later testify to opposite facts
when he wanted to upset the asphyxia
tion theory. "That question is very much
like asking me to call myself a liar," said
Dr. Buteau. Bennett smiled and his part
ner, Sawyer, stepped up and said, "I will
get between you, doctor." "Oh. never
mind." said Buteau; "I guess I am able
to lick the pair of you. Then the ex
amination proceeded.
Great efforts are expected on both sides
â¢when Dr. Woolsey shall testify for the
defense. The doctor is an old hand at
court practice, having been surgical ex
pert for the Southern Pacific Company
lor twenty years. He glories in a battle,
and it is known that he has spent man)
studious hours comparing the testimony
of the physicians opposed to him with thÂ»
conditions of the skull.
It is not altogether improbable that thÂ»
prosecution may yet steal the thunder
of the defense and try to secure an order
of court requiring the production of the
skull as an exhibit from -the State, with
out waiting for its production by the de
fense. /
LIVED FIVE SCORE
AND FOUR YEARS
MIT-iOiN - THOMAS.
BERKELEY, Feb. 17.â Milon Thomas.
a centenarian, aged 104 years, died this
morning at the residence of Mrs. C. H.
Spring, on Wolsey street, Lorln.
Deceased was born in Seneca Falls, N.
T., in 1795. He came of a family the
members of which for three generations
have lived beyond the century mark, his
father reaching 104 years, his grand
father, according to the family tradition,
having even, exceeded that age.
Their remarkable longevity they gener
ally attributed to frugal, temperate hab
its, all carefully refraining from tobacco
and stimulants of any kind. Milon, the
last of the three, was a splendid speci
men of physical and mental vigor, his
faculties remaining quite unimpaired un
til the last. He stood In height about C
feet 3 Inches, and with a robust constitu
tion was able to do manual labor in his
hundredth year. His friends say that
when about 50 years old he seemed for a
while to grow younger, and never in his
later years did he betray any signs of
extreme age.
Sixteen years ago he came to California
after a varied life in the East. He lived
for a while in Siskiyou County, and later
in Benicia before coming to Dorln. De

KERRIGAN SAYS
TODA'S ATTORNEY
DECEIVED HIM
Slave Owner's Bond
Is Increased.
BENCH WARRANT IS ISSUED
JAPANESE PUT UP TWELVE
HUNDRED DOLLARS.
Geffeney Denies That He Accepted
Bribes From the Gang Engaged
in Importing .Young Girls
From Japan.
Justice of the Peace Kerrigan was mad
clear through yesterday when he learned
how he had been tricked Into releasing
the Japanese procurer, Toda, on $2iw
bonds when charged with a felony. I*3
immediately took steps to rectify his mis
take, and at his instance Justice of the
Peace Groezinger, who was acting in the
place of Police Judge Conlan, raised the
bond to $1200 and issued a bench warrant
for the rearrest of the slippery slave
dealer. * Kerrigan says he was deceived in
the matter by Attorney D. J. Donavon,
who appeared for the Jap and who rep
resented that the charge constituted' a
simple misdemeanor. The Judge was not
aware of the seriousness of the offense
until Secretary Kane went to him yes
terday and informed him that Toda was
charged with a felony. When Bond Ex
pert Newman, after examining the bond,
pronounced it worthless, the case was
stated to Groezinger and the bench war
rant issued. Donavon attempted to stave
off action, but when he found his efforts
unavailing he notified his client and the
latter appeared at the City Hall in the
afternoon and gave new bonds in the
larger sum. '"
laraanaka, the chief of the syndicate
of slave dealers, called a meeting of the
members of the gang immediately after
the raid on Toda'a den, and the malado
rous gang assembled in the basement of
his bamboo factory late Thursday night.
The disclosures in regard to the nefarious
business as published in The Call evi
dently caused them considerable appre
hension, but just what action was taken
to throw the authorities off the track la
not known. ,/ , ; ,
Deputy Commissioner of Immigration
Geffeney is very much upset by the alle
gations that he has been accepting bribes
from the slave dealers to allow girls des
tined lor the vile dens to be landed at
this port. He protests that there is no
truth in the charges against him, and
declares that he is the victim of mall
clous enemies. ' â  '->;% â  â  â 
In regard to the landing of the Japan
ese Kito he said yesterday that Kito had
a passport and $40 in money when he ar
rived Here and that he allowed him to
land, together with his wife, on the
strength of his passport alone. Kito
maintains that he had no passport, and
that he was not allowed to land until he
had given his friend Morakamo $50. Mor
akamo says he paid the money to Gef
feney and took a receipt, which he turned
over to Kito. Geffeney is particularly in
censed at the story told by Mrs. I'amam
ora, the Japanese boarding house keeper,
to the effect that she paid him $250 before
he would allow her to land when she came
to America, seven years ago.
The matter has been reported to the
Japanese Consul, who has started an in
vestigation. , â¢ , ,
Officer L. C. Clark, Chief Lees' personal
representative, held a long conference
â¢ with Geffeney in the latter's office yes
terday, although for what purpose is not
definitely known. Possibly the Chief
fears that some of his pets on the force
are in danger because of their connection
with the slave traffic and sent his agent
to consult with Geffeney, who is in the
same boat, to concoct some plan to clear
their skirts and thus prevent the possi
bility of the department's reputation from
being smirched. It is hardly likely that
the old fossil would take the trouble to
Investigate his subordinates, as he might
find out something he does not care to
know or does not want people to think he
knows. But if the antiquated head of
the Police Department will shake off his
lethargy long enough to make a few
inquiries, properly directed, he may
learn something. For instance, he might
look up one Carey, to whom has. been del
egated the task of collecting to cents a
head each week on all the women owned
in this city by the members of the slave
dealers' syndicate as the price of police
protection. As there, are forty such
women living in slavish degradation In
the neighborhood of Brooklyn alley the
bribe-taking officers are enjoying a com
fortable "rake-off of $120 each, month
from this source alone. Unless the Chief
prefers to shut his eyes to the glitter of
gold and the corrupt practices of his of
ficers, he should either demand his
"divvy" or correct the abuse.
For some unaccountable reason, Cnier.
Lees appears to take a fatherly interest
in the prosperity of the denkeepers and
slave owners of the Chinatown district.
When Crowley was Chief of the San
Francisco Police Department he was al
ways willing to extend aid to the missions
in their efforts to rescue the unfortunate
slave girls from' the dens where they
were confined; but since the advent of the
senile decrepit individual who succeeded
him it is like pulling teeth to get any as
sistance from the police. Lees will not
allow his men to force an entrance into j
any of these places, no matter what the
urgency of the case. He insists that in \
all cases warrants for the parties wanted i
must first be secured, but whether his j
object is to give friendly, warning to the i
divekeepers the public must judge for it
self. Certain it is that whenever a war
rant is sworn out the birds have been
spirited away by the time the officers ar
rive upon the scene.
TERESA ' KERR ACQUITTED.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 17.â The Jury this
afternoon returned a verdict of not guil
ty in the case of . Teresa Kerr, charged
with the murder of George Bloom King,
the Deputy City Engineer, several weeks
ago. The verdict was rendered after a
deliberation of exactly nine minutes. The
defense proved that the shooting of King
was accidental, it having been the inten
tion of Miss Kerr to commit suicide. King
was shot while attempting to take the re

apparently insignificant resolution
I passed by the Supervisors, last Mon

portance to the taxpayers of this city was
submitted to the City and County Attor
ney. It Involved the question of who had
the right to assess electric or other street
car lines operated In more than one coun
tyâwhether the County Assessors of the
different counties In which such road was
operated or the State Board of Equaliza
tion.
... The resolution In' question asked .the
City and County Attorney to pass upon
"the Issue in relation to the San Mateo and
Ban Francisco Electric Railroad, Whose line
.extends from this county, into that of San
Mateo, and which Is how assessed by the
: State Board of Equalization. It Is known,
however, that the inspiration for the In-.
: traduction of the resolution, canfe from
the fear that the. same -question might
' soon have to be decided In" reference to.
the Market Street Railway Company, and
not from any great .desire to secure con-,
trol of the assessment for the San Mateo
and San Francisco line for the Assessor
of this city- and county. â¢ .â ''â '*'
In the constitution of the State is the
following provision under the head .of
revenue and taxation:
.. The franchise, roadway, .' roadbed, rails and
rolling, stock of . all railroads operated in more
than one county in this. State shall be assessed
by the State Board of Equalization at their
actual value, and the same ' shall -he appor
tioned to. the counties, cities and counties,

made a mistake yesterday afternoon that
cost her her life. For two years she had

noon she was seized with a violent fit of
coughing and ran into her bedroom to
swallow a dose of the medicine On her
: table was a bottle of carbolic acid along
side the bottle of medicine,, and she took
a swallow out of the wrong bottle. Shriek
. ing with pain she rushed into the kitchen
and startled her mother by exclaiming,
"My God. I have taken a sup out of the
.wrong bottle."..
Mrs. Fleming made her swallow doses

TORTURING DISFIGURING HUMORS
ITCHING BURNING AND SCALY ERUPTIONS
OF THE SKIN AND SCALP WITH
LOSS OF HAIR.
The agonizing itching and burning of the skin, as in Eczema; the
frightful scaling, as in psoriasis ; the loss of hair and crusting of the
scalp, as in scalled, head ; the facial disfigurement, as in pimples ana
ringworm the awful suffering of infants and the anxiety of worn-out
parents, as in milk crust, tetter, and salt rheum â all demand a remedy
'of almost superhuman virtues to successfully cope with them. That
Cuticura remedies are such stands proven beyond all doubt. r No state-
: ment is made regarding them that is not justified by the strongest evi-
dence. The purity and sweetness, . the power to* afford immediate
relief, the certainty of speedy and permanent cure, the absolute safety
and great economy, have made them the standard skin cures, and hu-
. mor remedies of the civilized world.
â¢ Those who have suffered long and hopelessly and who have lost
faith in doctors and medicines may make trial of these great curatives
. with the most gratifying success. The treatment is simple, direct,
agreeable, and economical, and is adapted to the youngest infant as well
as adults of every age. Bathe the affected parts with Hot Water and
<* Cuticura Soap to cleanse the surface of crusts and scales, and soften the
\ " thickened cuticle. Dry, without hard rubbing, and apply Cuticura Oint-
" ment freely, to allay itching, irritation, and inflammation, and soothe and
- heal, and lastly take the Cuticura Resolvent to cool and cleanse the blood.
â¢This sweet and wholesome treatment affords instant relief, permits res'*
and sleep in the severest forms of eczema and other itching, burning,
and scaly humors of the skin, scalp, and blood, and points to a speedy,
permanent, and economical cure when all other remedies and even the
best physicians fail.; The SET, costing $1.25, consisting of Soap, 25c,
. Ointment, 50c., and Resolvent (half size), 500, or each separately, may
be had of all chemists and stores where medicines are sold throughout
the world. . f

tended to apply only to steam railroads,
and that In consequence the assessing of
street railroads, even though they oper
ate in two or more counties, must remain
in the hands of the respective County
Assessors.
Mayor Phelan's fears were aroused on
this subject, by the dangerous proximity
of the Market-street Railway Company's
tracks to the San Mateo County line.
They now extend to within about one
thousand feet of the boundary between
that county and San Francisco. The
Mayor is apprehensive that this thousand
feet may be bridged, and that the- line
may 1 even be extended so as to lap over
into the neighboring county, thus, accord
ing to the present condition of things,
taking the nower of assessing the entire
railway system of that corporation from
. San Francisco's Assessor and giving it
to the State Board of Equalization. With
the very small interest that some of the
counties represented on the Board of
Equalization have in street railroads of
any: kind, it is feared that San Francisco
would be a great sufferer from the appre
hended change. The ideas of some of the
members of the Board of Equalization as
to the .value of the Market-street Rail
way Company's property might fall far
short of that of the local Assessor.
Should the Market-street Company ex
tend Its lines by ever so few feet into San
Mateo County, this action would, accord
ing to the prevailing interpretation of the
constitution, give jurisdiction to the State
Board of Equalization.
It is well known that about a year ago
the Market-street Railway Company con
templated asking for a franchise to ex
tend its cars to the San Mateo County
line, but no application was made to the
Supervisors, and nothing has been heard
of the proposition since.

son, as spokesman, .said that Stockton
had done much in the interest of the
Valley road, and it would be but just for
the Santa Fe to erect the machine shops

Mr. Watt replied that Stockton no doubt
was entitled to recognition, but the Val
ley road was powerless in the matter.
He thought the shops now at Bakersfleld,
Fresno and Stockton were sufficient for
present purposes and for some time to
come. However, he would lay the case
before the Santa Fe officials, who no
doubt would favorably consider the rep
resentations of the committee. The Stock
tohians returned much pleased with the
result of their visit. o* "

FROM HERO TO BURGLAR
John Allen, an ex-Soldier, Arrested
for Breaking Into a Cigar-Store.
. John Allen, an ex-soldier, was arrested
yesterday afternoon by Policeman Mort

bility.

proved to be Allen. Goldwater was
threatened with death if he attempted to
hold Allen, and, as there was no police
man in sight, he let him go.
. Yesterday afternoon Goldwater notified
Captain Spillane that the burglar was
hovering around the place again and
Policeman Moriarity was sent to arrest
him. Allen does not deny that he went

he did not steal anything. He had been

Three islanders arrived . here from far
Pltcairn last Thursday, night on the Brit
ish ship General Roberts. The vessel was
thirty-seven days out from Newcastle, N.
S. W., when the island was sighted. As
the wind was favorable Captain Tearon
decided to run down to the speck in the
ocean and secure a supply of fruit and
vegetables. When a boat put off from
j the island to the General Roberta, Thomas
Christian was one of the crew, and he
asked for a passage for himself and wife
and brother to San Francisco. The gal
lant captain and his wife were agreeable,
so the three islanders took passage on the
ship.
Mrs. Christian Is an American, having
beein born and raised in South Dakota.
j Over a year ago she came to California
i on a visit, where she met and .married
', Thomas Christian, a descendant â of one
of the mutineers of the Bounty. From
here .they went to Pitcairn, on the British
ship Hyderbad and are now back in the
State again for a visit. -
There are only five family names on
Pltcairn. They are McCoy, Warren,
Christian, Young and Coffin. A family by
the name of Smith have taken up their
abode on the island during the past year,
but they have not as yet joined the col
ony.
"Mr. Smith came aboard the General
Roberts to see us off," . said Mrs. Chris
tian yesterday, "and the last thing he
said to me was, 'Tell my friends in Cali
fornia that I am going to end my days
on Pltcairn." Mr. Smith's initials are- J.
C, and he used to own a ranch in lowa-
He came to California for his health
thirteen years ago, and owned a ranch
at Lomoore, Kings County. He and his
wife, his daughter Lizzie, aged 20, and
son Robbie, aged 18, went to Pitcairn on
the Hyderbad, and while Robbie and Liz
zie would like to visit the States again
I think Mr. and Mrs. Smith will end their
days on Pitcairn. On their arrival they
were given a piece of land and a house
was built for them, and now -they â¢ are
quite comfortable and contented." â  ; .
The story of the murder of Clara War
ren and her. child by Harry Christian on
Pitcairn has been -partially told exclu
sively! in The Call. Last November the
murderer was taken to Fiji 'on the British
man-of-war Royalist, and there hanged
for his crime. The arm of British jus
tice Is very long when it comes to giving
the slayer of a woman and child his de
serts.
"Harry Christian brought the first real
horror they had ever known into the. lives
of the islanders," said. Mrs. Christian, on
board the General Roberts yesterday.-. "He
murdered â¢ the - woman who was 'Â looked
upon as his wife, and his child. Harry
fell in love â¢ with Clara f Warren,, and >. she
bore him a daughter. When the child was
about eighteen months old he got- tired of
his old love and wanted to get rid of her,
as he was smitten with Edith Young,
niece of Rose Young,; the author of the
'Story of the Bounty,' Â» and wanted to
marry her. She would have nothing to
do with him, and he laid it at the door
of Clara Warren and his child. How the -
thing happened will never be known, but
Harry,- Clara and . the : child were seen
on the cliffs one evening. The next morn
ing Harry was around as usual, but Clara
and the child were never seen again. Some
of their I clothing was found .on the rocks
below when the tide went out, but that
was the only trace ever . recovered of
Clara and her child. ' â¢-. â " _

To -Day's Wasp.
A double-page illustration of a satirical
poem. "Never Speak 111 of the Beef," is a j
leading feature of the Wasp this week. j
The verses are good, and .witty, and the
caricatures of Julius Caesar, Joshua, Na
poleon, etc., are in Gordon Ross' best
vein. The half-tones are very beautiful,
this week's picture in the "Our Oriental
Neighbors" series being a scene in Tokio.
Japan. The Alcazar and Orpheum are
written up by Touchstone in light style;
Carreno is commented upon by R. A. Luc
chesi, and Teresa Doane contributes some
capital stories in her Social Sidelights.
The first page cartoon is a graphic pic
ture of an editor's bullet-proof suit, such
as may be needed by journalists.
Mrs. Began _ Case.
Argument on the writ, of habeas corpus
presented on behalf of Mrs. Elizabeth
Regan, charged with the murder of Officer
Kennedy, was heard by Judge Cook yes
terday morning. As the transcript of tes
timony from the Police Court was not
ready. Judge Cook gave Attorney ' Long
until this afternoon at 5 o'clock in which
to present it. The matter was taken under
advisement by Judge Cook and will be
decided next week.

-Must Suffer the Penalty. V
Some time . ago George C. Owens of
Stanislaus County killed his wife, from
whom he had separated, and wounded his â¢
daughter with a pistol. He was tried for.
murder and found guilty in the first de- â¢
gree. During the trial his plea *â¢ was In- _"
sanity, and from the judgment he ap
pealed on several technical, grounds. The -
Justices of the Supreme Court -would . not
recognize any of them and refused to in-.
terfere with the judgment. Therefore his
only hope to escape the rope lies in the â¢
Governor. -S ' 'â 'â¢ 'â¢
