NEW YORK, May 14.â Wash
ington correspondent of the
Herald telegraphs: A satis
factory conclusion is expected ,
by administration officials from |
the conference which will be held hv ;
the American Philippine Commission
with the mission which Aeuinaldo
proposes to send to Manila.
In his dispatch to the War Depart
ment to-day General Otis announced
that n.aldr. had sent a messenger to j
him expressing a wish to send a com
mie-sinf *ntÂ« arranpe terms of peace."
Administration officials express the !
opinion that this commission will sub
mit to President Schurman and his j
associates the answer of Aguinaldo to j
the proposition made by the American !
commission to Colonel \re:uflles. Aeul
naldo's emissary, regarding the char
' 'i- acter of povernment which would he
â¢ given to the Filipinos and which Ar- ;
guell^s declared was satisfactory.
It is probably apparent to the Fili
pinos that there is nothing to be grained
by conducting negotiations for the nur-
Ipose of obtaining a temporary cessation
of hostilities. General Otis will not
grant an armistice; and he has shown
that he does not propose to stop ficht
â¢ing. no matter how many peace emis-
Baries Aguinaldo may send to Manila, j
unless they agre^ to unconditional sur- I
render. In his dispatch. General Otis i
shows that despite the fact that Agui- j
naldo stau-s his purpose to nd a com- j
mission to arrange peace he is making i
preparations to continue military j
operations.
It is evident to the officials from this I
dispatch that General Otis has found it j
necessary to change his plans. He has
been making preparations to attack
Bacolor. where 9000 insurgents are be- !
!iÂ«ved to be encamped, and it is pre- I
fumed that th-> movements reported to- j
day still have that point as the ob
jective. General L.awton is maklncr ex
cellent progress in his northward
march, and the dispatch of Major
Kobbe with 1500 men up the Rio
Grande, supported by gunboats and |
cascoes. is for the purpose of enabling j
General Lav/ton to cross the Rio
Grande without molestation by the en- i
â¢ emy.
: . : â¢ The plan apparently- contemplates the
rapid swinging of Law ton to the west, i
General Mac Arthur to remain at San
Fernando, between the Insurgents at
Bacolor arid those at Mexico, and
Kobbe is to take station so as to pre
vent them from crossing the Rio
Grande. Mac Arthur Is also needed at
.^[ his present point to protect communi- :
"^cation with Manila.

WASHINGTON, May 14.â Admiral
Dewey's home coming by way of the
Mediterranean is likely to give occasion
for distinguished honors from the
navies of Europe, most of them being
represented by extensive squadrons in
those waters, and some of them having
their chief naval stations at Mediter
, ranean ports Already Ambassador
i Cam bo of France has called the atten
j tion of the authorities at Paris to the
return of Admiral Dewey by way of the
Mediterranean and the probable. sailing j
lof his flagship, the Olympia, past the
| French naval ports in Algiers. These j
j are opposite the British possessions of
| Gibraltar and Malta, at the entrance to j
the Mediterranean, and are easy and j
natural Estopping places along- that \
route. It is hardly expected that the
Admiral will touch at Toulon, the great
naval depot of France.
At the ports of French Algiers he '
| will be accorded every honor due, not
only to his rank, but to the universal
esteem in which he is held by the naval
fraternity.
The British authorities have taken
no steps thus far to have the Admiral
."top at British ports, but it was stated
to-day by one of the British officers
that Dewey would be assured a. most
enthusiastic greeting if he stopped at
any British station, and that undoubt
edly step? would be taken to induce
him to touch at Plymouth and Ports
mouth, the southern naval depots of
England, if there was any prospects
of his acceptance. In any event, it is
said, the Admiral was quite likely to
stop at Malta ami Gibraltar, as these
are the usual coaling places, and this
would give an opportunity for an ex
pression of British esteem for him. in
the event that the admiral could be in
duced to stop in England en route
home, it is said he probably would be :

ALGER MAY
YET LEAVE
THE CABINET
Struggle for the Senatorship '
Likely to Lead to His
Retirement.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW TORK, .May 14.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Michi
gan political complications may ac- ;
complish whai public opinion and the
scandal failed to do. They may ;
force Secretary of War Alger out of
the Cabinet.
The situation in Michigan briefly
stated is this: Secretary Alger wants
to be sent to the Senate and thus se
cure a vindication from his own State.
Senator McMillan wishes to be re
c-lected to the Senate. Governor Pin
gree wants the support of the Michigan
delegation to the next Republican con
vention for the Presidential nomina
tion. Senator McMillan has refused al
liance with the Pingree faction. He
will make his fight for the Senatorship
as a supporter of the administration
and an advocate of Michigan's vote in
the convention being cast for the re
nomination of President McKinley.
Seen tary Alger cannot hope to win if i
he antagonizes both Senator McMillan
and Governor Plngree. To secure the
Senatorship he must make an alliance
with Governor Pingree against McMil
lan. Alliance with Governor Pinsree
means that he must oppose the admin
istration and endeavor to secure a dele- I
â  '.' to the P Ã¼blican convention
antagoni. ti to President McKinlev. To
do this and remain in th<- Cabinet is
impossible. Secretary Alger is at the
parting of tin- ways. He must either
give up his Senatorial ambition or he
must resign from the War Department.
There has not yet been am- open |
breach between Secretary Alger and
Senator McMillan, but partisans of both
sidep say it cannot be much longer
avoided. There [s every prospect of aj
lively fight within the Republican ranks
in Mulligan, and as it will involve th<
admi: istration it will interest the whole
country.

BRANDS IT
OUTRAGE ON
THE PEOPLE
La Rue's Caustic Language
on Attempt to Dismiss
Grain Rate Cases.
MILLS MADE PROMISE
But the Southern Pacific Company
Avoided Putting Its Proposi
tion in Writing.
EX-RAILROAD COMMISSIONER
LA RUE was seen at his Sacra
mento home last evening by a
representative of The Call, and in the
course of an exhaustive interview,
branded in his most vigorous lan
guage as an outrage upon the people
of this State the efforts of the South
ern Pacific to have the grain-rate
cases dismissed through the agency
of the company's creatures on the
Railroad Commission â Laumeister
and Blackstock.
He read the expose of Mr.
Herrin's manipulations in The Call of
yesterday morning and -was familiar
with every phase of the case. Con
cerning the statement made in the
original report on the casÂ«s, made by
Blackstock and suppressed by Her
; rin. to the effect that he had informed
Blackstock that the railroad had ap
proached him with a proposition to i
dismiss the grain-rate cases provided
the commission would recede from its i
| 25 per cent resolution, he said that j
he had been so approached on behalf
of the company by William H. Mills; j
but he denied ever having so in- !
formed Blackstock.
Mr. La Rue's opinion of this latest j
job of the railroad and his evidence I
! in the case is best told in the wired !
report of the interview had with him |
in Sacramento, v.hich follows:
SACRAMENTO. May 14.-Said ex
; Railroad Commissioner La Rue. when
; asked to-night by The Call corre
! spondent for a statement with reference
to the story appearing' In to-day's Call
fastening the authorship of Black
stock's grain rate case report upon TV
F. Herrin:
"I consider the proposition to dismiss
this grain casr one of the greatest out
rages ever perpetrated upon the tax
payers of California. The questions in
volved in that case relate to the power
of the Commission to reduce or estab
lish rates not only now but in the fu
ture. They are questions which must
be settled some time, and they were in
a fair way to settlement when the pres
ent Railroad Commission decided to
ask for a withdrawal of the litigation.
thus rescinding the action of the former
Commission.
"Between 130,000 and $40 000 of the peo
ple's money had been expended In the
prosecution of the matter and there was
a fair assurance that we would win.
"Naturally it was to the railroad
company's advantage to have the cases
dismissed, since, had it lost it would
have been liable for many thousands of
dollars in damages.
"Other questions than the mere right
of the Railroad Commission to enforce
a reduction were involved. For one
thing, the legality of the leases under
which the Southern Pacific of Kentucky
operated the variously named divisions
in this State would have been de
termined. Of course, it was to the in
terest of the railroad company to avoid
an issue with such vital consequences
to it."
Mr. La Rue said that he did not re
member ever having spoken personally
to Blackstock upon the subject of the
grain rate case, as related in Black
stock's report. What statements he did
make, he said, were made before the
entire board.
"About a year before the expiration
of the term of office of the former
board," continued he, "Attorney Pills
bury, who represented the Hubbard-
Searles interests in the East, said that
his clients were tired of the litigation,
and that he would like to arrive at a
settlement. Nothing, however, ever
came of this.
"Last year W. H. Mills of the
Southern Pacific Company came to me
and stated that his company was tired
of the litigation, and was willing to
dismiss the injunction suit and put the
8 per cent grain reduction in opera
tion, provided the Railroad Commission
would withdraw the resolution favoring
an eventual 23 per cent general redac
tion on freight rates.
"I called on Judge Hayne of counsel
for the Railroad Commission, and we
discussed Mills' proposition. I thought
it would be a good thing to accept it.
since by that means we would gain all
we desired.
"Judge Hayne thought favorably ->f
the proposition and I then had a meet
ing with Mr Mills, stating that if he
would put his proposition in writing I
would bring it before the board. .ills
answered that it was all right and that
he would have the company put in
writing its agreement to dismiss the in
junction suit and accept the S per cent
reduction on grain. ..;-.
"I saw no more of him for ten days,
when he informed me that the company
had decided not to put the proposition
in writing, but that one of the railroad
attorneys would see Attorney-General
Fitzgerald and arrange the matter with
him V
"Subsequently Attorney-General Fitz
gerald informed me that he had never
been approached upon the subject. I
stated these facts to the Railroad Com
mission about January Ist last. I nev< r
had any talk with Blackstockon the
subject that I can remember.
"Mr. Mills was very nice in making
the proposition, but when he was asked
to put it before the board in writing he
failed to act; the railroad â¢ company
never made the proposition to the board

Action in Idaho.
Special PispHfh to ThÂ» Call.
NEW rORK, May 14. Tho Central
Federated Labor Union unanimously
adopted resolutions to-day denouncing
General Merriam for ordering the dis
bandment of the miners' unions in Idaho
and instructing the secretary to ask the.
War Department whether it is respon
sible for ( r-ral Merriam's conduct.
The resolutions adopted are:
Resolved, That the Central Federated
Union of New York protests against Gen
eral Merriam's unwarranted use ot mili
t irv power to browbeat the striking min
ers of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and for de
claring martial law under which he com
mands the disorganisation of all unions
and orders employers to discharge every
miner who does not withdraw from his
trades union.
dyed. That the secretary write to
the War Department, asking whether it
is responsible for General Merriam's con
duct and if bo, stating that it will be
held to answer for the possible conse
quences Of such aggravating methods.
Delegate Harris of the International j
Cigarmakers' Onion said that through i
General Merriam's edict, the miners' I
trades unions have been placed outside
of the pale of the law and the union
should demand the withdraw;.! of the
cdii t and the Investigation and court
martial of i â¢ neral Merriam.
"President McKlnley should be called
upon to order an investigation." he
said.
Georgf "Warner, busin-ess agent of
New York City Lodge of International
Machinists' Union, said: "A conference
of all labor leaders in the country
should be called to decide on action to
be taken at the ballot box."
Delegate Rubin of the Waiters' Un
ion said: "All this is the outcome of
imperialism."
A voice: "Shoulder a gun."
Delegate Kelly of the Theatrical Pro
tective Union said: "Something should
be done by organized labor to prevent
the disruption of trades unions through
Federal interference."
HI': LENA. Mont., May 14. â Governor
Smith has addressed a letter to Gen
eral Merriam, commanding general of
the military forces in the Coeur
d'Alene whtle that district is under
martial law, to the effect that no more
arrests of persons suspected of having
been implicated in the Wardner riot
may be made in Montana without
proper authority from the State. It
! had been represented to the Governor
I by a committee from the labor unions,
which waited on him four days ago,
1 that steps were being taken by General
Merriam to arrest all miners in Mon
tana suspected of leaving the Coeur
j d'Alene, and that if the military was
permitted to do so many men innocent
of any offense would be deprived of
their liberty without process of law.

SHANGHAI, May 14.â The Tsung Li
Tamen (Chinese foreign office) has re
plied to the Russian Minister at PeKing.
M. de Giers, that the Government is
unable to accede to the Russian de
mand, made last Wednesday, for a new
railway concession connecting Peking
with Russia's present system in Man
churia.
Not since the taking of Port Arthur
by Russia have the Chinese been so
agitated as over this demand. Whether
M; de Giers named a specific route is
not yet ascertained, some officials as
serting that only a preliminary notice
was given by Russia and others that
she is asking- for a line direct from
Peking to Shanghai Kwon.
Certainly the British legation in !
Peking had no previous knowledge that
such proposal was coming from St
Petersburg. The concession asked for
would ruin the existing northern rail
ways, in which British capital to the
amount of Â£2,000,000 is invested, but
there seems to be no alternative route
without interfering with plans for rail
way extension which the Chinese them
selves have in mind.
It is believed that Russia's action in
this matter is intended to demonstrate
to the world that the recent convention
with Great Britain respecting spheres
of influence iiÂ» China, which was com
municated to the Chinese Government
almost before this latest concession was
demanded, has not fettered the action
of Russin at the Court of Peking and
alr-o to strengthen Russia's -restige
with the Chinese, which was unfavor
ably affected by her withdrawal of her
late protest respecting the northern
railways.

DR. BRIGGS
ORDAINED
A PRIEST
Admitted to the Episcopal
Church Without Per

BISHOP POTTER iCTS
All the Officiating Clergymen Very
Nervous and the Ceremonies
Hurried Through.
Special Dippatrh to The Call.
NEW YORK. May 14.â 1n the pro
cathedral on Stanton street. Rev. Dr.
Brir^rs, who was suspended for heresy
by the Presbyterian Assembly, was or
dain< d a priest of the Episcopal church.
He was ordained together with the Rev.
Charles N. Snedeker, and the ordina
tion c- monies were conducted by
Bishop Potter. The little church was
crowded with people, and the cere
monies were notable for the auiteness
tl at prevailed.
Those who expected from the great
outcry of the past three of four weeks
pome sensational features were disap
pointed. There was no scene, no ex
citement, and no protest was filed at
the beginning, during or at the close of
the ordination.
There was nothing notable in the ser
mon preached by Rev. Dr. George Wil
liam Douglass.
The ceremonies were %'cry long, com
mencing at 10:30 o'clock and continuing
until late in the afternoon. If any
thing, the services were hurried a lit
tle, and the general communion which
followed the communion of the postu
lents, or candidates, tended to extend
the time.
There was a large crowd about the
little pro-cathedral church as early as
7:30 o'clock. This increased as the time
for the ordination ceremonies ap
proached After the Sunday school had
finished its exercises, the vicar. Rev.
Dr. Paddock, v.as approached by In
spector Cross of the police, who held a
conversation with him. Several police
men were outside the church and some
in the church.
The church does not seat more than
500 people, ana ;h â "â¢â¢ about fvice
that number sitting and standing.
Bishop Potter drove to the church with
the candidates for admission. Rev. Dr.
Charles A. Brigcs and Rev. Dr. C. A.
Snedeker.
Dr. C. B. Smith, who was to present
Dr. Briggs, and who is r eritus rector
of St. James' church, and Dr. George P.
Nelson, who was to present Dr.
Snedeker, and who is one of the as
sistant secretaries of the diocese, ar
rived later together. With them was
Rev. L>;\ Osborne of Trinity Ch.rch.
Trenton N. J. All of the?r> went to the
office of the vicar. Bishop Potter was
asked what he had to say preliminary
to the ceremonies. He said he had no
notice of protest, and had received no
protest. He smiled at the thought of
any of the objecting cler- aen appear
ing in the church and making a scene.
He, however, said that he ha<l received
a letter from a layman protesting
against the ordination of Dr. Briggs.
and as this letter v.'as written under a
misapprehension of the facts and law.
he had wered. H â¢ did nr>t desire to
give the name of the layman who. he
said, was high up in the councils of the
church.
Rev. Dr. Briggs was somewhat ner
vous, though he did not betray it in the
church during the services. There was
a semblance of nervousness in all the
celebrants. There seemed to lie a ten
dency to hurry through the ceremonies.
The church was not decorated. Only a
few potted â  !;t:its and a few lillies were
in the chancel.
Promptly at 1:30 o'clock the organist
began an organ voluntary. He had
Bcarcel' 1 ' finished it when the opening
strains of the processional were heard.
The usual order was observed in the
processional. After the choir came the
vicar, Rev. Dr. Paddock, th<~-n the can
didates, Rev. Doctors Briggs and Sne
deker, their s onsors, Rev. Doctors
Smith and Osborne. and lastly the
bishop. Rev. Dr. Briggs wore the stole
of a ademical degree, as also did Rev.
Dr. Snedeker.
The congregation stood during the

Prospector Finds Ore Yielding Twen

Metal.
TACOMA, May 14.â Kor nearly two
years A. L. Mattison, a miner of Port
land, Or., has been quietly prospecting in
the Olympic mountains, which have been
searched unsuccessfully heretofore for
mineral veins. Mattison went deeper into
the mountains than earlier prospectors
and has been rewarded by uncovering
some ledges that are likely to cause big
mining excitement in the Olympic pejiin
sula. His nearest locations are in Elwha
Valley, twelve miles southeast of Port
Angels. He has penetrated ledges with
drifts and tunnels, obtaining ore running
$20 to the ton. One ledge has a width of
200 feet, carrying gold, silver and copper
ore. Mattison has just taken numerous
samples to San Francisco to be assayed.

SPAIN WILL WITHDRAW
TROOPS FROM PHILIPPINES
MADRID, May 14.â Senor Don Francis- j
co Bilvela, the Spanish Premier, in an in
terview to-day regarding the attack by
the Filipinos upon the Spanish garrison
at Zamboanga, island of Mindanao, in
which two Spanish officers and three men
were wounded and one man killed, said:
"It is very painful to us to have sus
tained these losses in a territory which
dr.es not belong to US. We left these
troops in the Philippines in the hope that
they might aid in securing the release of
the Spanish prisoners in the hands of the
Filipinos. Our efforts in this direction
have been fruitless. Aguinaldo refusi
with us, and a Frenchman (,M. Du
marais) who had offered on our behalf
tn treat with the enemy, was killed by
them.
"America has not yet succeeded, as she
has no more authority than we had. We

ritory that we are obliged to defend, and
I ha â  .1 1 Rios to use
three steamers for the Immediate trans
portation of our troops from Zamboanga

American commander may possess the
territory we art- abandoning. "

manifesto to the press declaring "that
the Filipino Government" will reject all
tiatlons for peace on the part of the
Americans based upon any scheme of au
tonomy and will demand that the United

the declaration of war with Spain. The
manifesto denied that General Antonio
Luna has surrendered, and asserts that
Major.-General Lawton is routed and that

FORMER NEGRO
SLAVES DUPED
Victims of a Gig-antic
Fraud.
THOUSANDS GIVE UP MONEY
TOLD THEY ARE ABOUT TOjBE
PENSIONED.
Willingly Contribute Twenty-Five
Cents Each to Have Their
Names Placed on
the Lists.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 14.â A Washiner
ton special to the Herald says:
Thousands of colored men in this coun
try are being induced to believe that |
they are to be pensioned by the United i
States Government upon being: able to i
show that they were formerly slaves.
The promoters of this scheme have been
at work for several years and it is
estimated that more than $150,000 has
been collected by those having the pro
ject in hand.
The matter came to the surface
through some correspondence .between ]
a colored preacher and a United States !
Senator. The preacher told the Sena
tor that many colored people in his
State had been assessed to defray the
expenses of obtaining proposed legisla- ]
tlon. The Senator, who is one of the j
most influential members of that body, j
instituted an investigation, and this is
the substance of what he reported to !
the colored divine:
During the last ten years the Ex- j
Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and. Pen- I
sion Association of the United States j
of America has sent agents f o every !
State in the Union for the .rpose of
i locating all former slaves. These
â  former slaves are told that legislation
is now pending before Congress to give
them these pensions: Persons seventy ]
years old or mure to receive $500 and
| $15 a month, persons sixty years old to
; receive $300 and $S a month, persons
i less than fifty years to receive $4 a
'. month. All supposed beneficiaries of
\ the proposed legislation are required to
i pay the association 25 cents as a resris-
I tration fee. It is said that more than
! 600,000 former slaves have been reeis
| tered.
The circular sent out by the associa
i tion calls attention to the bill to per
' sion former slaves introduced in the
i House of Representatives on June 24.
; 1890, by then Representative Connell of
! Nebraska. In the Fifty-fourth Con
' gress Senator Thurston introduced the
' Connell bill in the Senate. The circular
; calls especial attention to thÂ«:> fart that
i the hill "passed two readings and was
I referred to the pension committee."
To those who are not familiar with
the parliamentary proceedings of Sen
ate "passed to the second reading"
sounds like making considerable pro
greSÃ. As a matter of fact the Connell
j bill, or a similar measure, has been in
; troduced at every session of Congress
; during the last ten years and Bent to
i pensions committee, but never' con
i sidered. _____________

Monterey's Historic Seal.
MONTEREY. May 14.â An interesting
bit of municipal history was brought to

Court of this county last week. E. L. Wil

course of his testimonw a description of
the first seal adopted by the Ayunta- â 
miento (Common Council) of Monterey
City and the manner in which it was
used. The seal was a round piece of
brass, without the present lever attach
ment, and was designed to make impres
sions on sealing -wax. The seal was
adopted on April 10. IS.V), at a time when
the present seals for impressing the paper
Itself wore unheard of. The old seal is 'â 
still used by the Monterey city offli ials,
but IS now mounted in a modern ma
chine, with the usual lever attachment
and leaden die for making the impression

Suicide.
MRS. BERRILL'S COMPLAINT
THINKS THE OFFICIALS ACTED !
TOO HASTILY.
Says They Should Have Discovered ;
That Her Husband's Hania
Tended Toward Self-
Destruction.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN JOSE, May 14.â Mrs. Grace Ber
rill of Fruitvale charges that undue
haste on the part of Judge Carroll
Cook and Drs. LustU and Reithers to
commit her husband, C. L. Berrill, to
the Stockton Insane Asylum, together
with negligence on the part of the
management of St. Luke's Hospital, Is
responsible for her widowhood. She
will demand an investigation of the
commitment by the State Lunacy Com
mission and may bring civil and crim
inal actions against those she declares
are at fault. Mrs, Berrill has engaged
Attorney John G. Jury of this city, and
he has been investigating for the past
ten days.
Berrili was a bookkeeper in the
Wells-Fargo Bank in San Francisco
for a number of years. He overworked
himself, and about April 1 was com- I
pelled to take a vacation. On Friday,
April 28, he returned to his home in bad
mental condition. His hallucinations
turned to electrical subjects and he
searched in every conceivable place to
find batteries. After supper he started
from home for San Francisco, but his
wife detained him. Berrill attempted
! suicide by strychnine and later threat
ened to jump from a ferryboat.
Mrs. Berrill decided to take her hus
-1 band to St. Luke's Hospital, and at
I about 9 o'clock that evening she left j
! her husband there. A nurse was hired
to sit up with him and temporary ar
, rangements made. She was to have
called the next day and perfect details,
i If any change occurred in the mean
time, she says, she was to have been
notified.
At about midnight Berrill became
violent and attacked the attendant
with a knife. Dr. Van Dyke, in charge
, of the hospital, called the police and
! had Berrill removed to the Receiving
itaL He was booked as insane.
Mrs. Berrill says she was not notified.
At 11 o'clock the next morning Berrill
I was taken before Judge Cook and after
an examination committed to the
I Stockton asylum. Doctors Lustig and
Iteithers were the examining physl
< inns. Dr. Van Dyke, the widow al
leges, was the only witness examined,
although her address was known. The i
commitment stated that Berrill was
â  possessed of homicidal tendencies. Mrs.
I Berrill claims that had she been n>
, tified her testimony would have proved |
that the tendencies were suicidal and
not homicidal.
On a Saturday afternoon Berrill was j
i taken to Stockton, and the following
I Sunday night committed suicide by
; hanging himself to a bedpost. The
widow charges that the haste of the
Judge and the physicians was respon
sible for his death, for had she been
summoned she would have proved he |
was possessed of a desire to kill him
self and the asylum authorities would
have taken precautions to guard
against it.
The widow alleges that the manner
:in which Berrlll's body was shipped
from Stockton was inhuman and bar
barous. When the casket was opened
at his home in the presence of the fam
ily the body was stark naked, she de
clares, and on top of it had been
thrown some old underclothing. At

Standard probably will adapt a similar
course. The question of Importing miners
to operate them has been considered, but
the proposal has been turned down, No
imported labor may bo looked for. Here j
in Warflner a suspension of work on the
Last Chance also may be expected. The
property is working about 100 union men,
and practically none have applied for a
working permit. The Last Chance with
the mines up Canyon Creek doubtless will I

authorities. , _
The work of const ructinc the Bunker
Hill mill is going rapidly ahead. Most of
the debris has been cleared away, ana it
has been found that the damage was
much less than had been expected. Ihe
strikers, with all day on their hands and
3000 pounds of powder, were too swift in
distributing their dynamite, and instead
of blowing the mill to atoms they still left
much valuable machinery standing. Al
ready a fac simile of the old seventy-drill
compresser has been ordered and will be
rushed through. About 120 men are at
work rebuilding the mill. One hundred
are taking out shipping ore at the mine
and thirty are driving the new long tun

ANTI-TAMMANY CLUBS.
Chicago Platform Democrats Organ
izing in New York.
NEW YORK, May 14.â The preliminary
Steps toward the formation of an anti-
Tammany organization which William J.
Bryan is expected to recognize as the real
Democratic party in this city were taken
to-night. A committee of twenty Chica
j go platform Democrats was appointed to
perfect organization in every Assembly
district in Manhattan, and the auuounce
ment was made that an organization by
Assembly districts already had been made
j in Brooklyn.
Politicians who have been awaiting the
results of the recent visit of Mr. Bryan
to this city, anu of the later visit of for
mer Governor William J. Stone, see in
to-night's action the sequel to the Bryan
dinners last month. The starting of a
systematic movement to form a new par
ty organization here is regarded as the
natural result of Mr. Bryan's refusal to
attend the $10 dinner of the Democratic
! Club and of his presence at the $1 dinner
' of the Chicago platform Democrats.

GOOD MEN PUT
UP FOR MAYOR
Municipal Campaign in
Stockton.
CANDIDATES ARE VERY ACTIVE
â¢ \ i
THEIR CANVASS FREE FROM
;1v PERSONAL ABUSE.
Issues Involving the Progress of the
City Are to Be Decided in the
Battle at the
Polls.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. May 14.-The closing days
of the local municipal campaign are char
acterized by great activity in behalf of
the respective nominees. I Both the Re
publican and Democratic nominees are
good men. W. Bruce Harrison, the Demo
cratic candidate for Mayor, Is a man of
high character and ability, but his candi
dacy Is recognized to be weak inasmuch
as he Is manager for a corporation and all
of his nearest interests are linked with
the exclusive business community on the
waterfront. As the sentiment In behalf of
a Stockton harbor and a canal to tide
water is growing daily, and the voters do
not believe Mr. Harrison is in sympathy
with these ideas on account of his busi
ness connections, his personal standing is
not sufficient to overcome the prejudice.
Mr. Harrison is not an office seeker and
did not enter the campaign through any
Inclination of his own.
The Republican convention put up an
| equally good man In George W. Lang
i ridge. Mr. Langridge Is a young mer
chant with advanced ideas on municipal
matters and has come out with a positive
advocacy of certain projects which are
not only of Interest to Stockton but the
entire State as well. The Stockton Har
bor project provides for certain dredging
and "cut offs" which will make a harbor
one-fifth of a mile square, where now
there is only the shallow slough. Mr.
Langridge says on this subject:
The water front Is the key to our city's great
ness. It should be improved, . but not in such
j a manner or under such restrictions that a few
j shall receive exclusive advantages, or that ex
isting corporate interests shall hamper pro
gress. Throueh the foresight of our earlier i
officials our water front has not been given
away to private corporations and still remains
the property of the city, and If properly devel
oped under a broad and generous policy will
bring to our doors mercantile, shipping and
manufacturing interests of vast proportions.
In reference to the canal to tide water
he says:
According: to recent estimates a canal to deep
water from Stockton Channel can be built for
about $350,000. Such an enterprise would make
our city a grain center rivaling any in the
world; would bring capital to our doors; would
furnish employment for labor; would dispose
of the differentials, and, following the results
obtained elsewhere, would not add a cent to
the tax rate. The Manchester canal cost ex
ceeded $75,000,000, and not one cent was added
to the tax rate, owing to the consequent lnfluex
of capital and large Increase of population.
A popular chord is struck by the follow
ing declaration:
Municipal ownership of the public utilities,
especially water and public light, is a matter
of vital importance to this community. I be
lieve that the water supply is too close to the
people's lives, too vital a necessity to be left
in the hands of any private corporation. Every
i inhabitant of this city la entitled to receive an
adequate sudplv of pure, wholesome water,
furnished absolutely at cost. At the same time
regard must be had for vested private inter
; ests. I shall use my very best effort to have
! this question submitted to the people for their
decision by ballot. >
Mr. Harrison has not defined his posi
tion on any of these subjects. The cam
paign is entirely free from personal abuse
and the result will depend more upon the
i principles Involved than upon the men,
. as both nominees stand high in the public
favor. \i _, â 
Another feature is the presence of a So
cialist ticket in the field and some interest
is felt as to how large a vote will be
polled. Ross I. But-11. the mayorality
nominee of the Section, is a brother of
P. A. Buell, the lumber dealer and plan-
Ing mill owner.
TRAPDOORS IN WALKS
DECLARED A NUISANCE
Owners of Property and Not the Ten
ants Are Responsible for Any
Accidents.
STOCKTON, May 14.â The instructions
given on Thursday by Judge Budd to the
jury in the case of E. A. Rider vs. Clark,
Henery and Wood, defendants, for $7600
claimed as damages, will be of general in
terest to property-owners throughout the
State. The facts are briefly as follows:
Defendants Clark and Henery two years
ago constructed a modern three-story
building on their premises in this city and
surrounded it with the latest improved
concrete sidewalk. Upon the sidewalk
they erected two iron doors leading into
the basement, and then leased one of
the stores to a tenant, Defendant "Wood,
who had full charge, possession and con
trol.
E. A. Rider was an extraman in the
employ of the Stockton Fire Department.
Last November, responding to an alarm,
he ran down Sutler street. Wood was
using the doors In the sidewalk, which,
when open, stood twenty-four inches
above the walk. Rider did not see ihe
doors. He ran ngainst them, fell into
the opening, losing several teeth and be
ing otherwise injured.
t'minsel for the defendants submitted
sixteen instructions to the court, all of
which were refused, including an instruc
tion to the effect that under certain con
ditions if warranted by the evidence, the
lury might find a verdict in favor of
plaintiff and against the tenant, Wood,
and might also find in favor of the de
fendant owners, Clark and Henery, as
against the plaintiff. The court virtually
instructed the jury that sidewalk doors
when open were virtually a nuisance per
se for which the owners of the building
were liiable. The jury found a verdict
against all of the defendants in the sum
of $1000.
A motion for a new trial will be made,
and if denied, the case will be appealed to
the Supreme Court by reason of the fact
that a great principle of law is involved
affecting every property-owner in cities in
this State. If the instructions given to
the jury be correct, then the owners of
all modern buildings, having sidewalk
doors will be compelled to cement and
close the doors unless they stand guard
in order to prevent loss by reason of care
lessness or negligence on the part of ten
ants.
Did Not Murder Her Husband.
GEORGETOWN, Colo., May 14.â The
trial of Mrs. Jane Fish, accused of having

made by the Woodmen of the World,
from which order Mrs. Fish sought to col
lect insurance on her husband's life.
Benefit for Parson Harris.
NEW YORK, May 14.â Rev. James H.
W. Harris, formerly of Oakland, Cal.,

pear. At the close Mr. Harris, clad in
clerical garb, thanked the audience for
its attendance and expressed his sorrow
at the fact that all those announced had
not taken part.

FALSE REPORT OF
CLEVELAND'S DEATH
F^umor GaiQS Currency That tf)e
Ex-President Died While
Fishing.
TOLEDO, Ohio, May 14.â 1n some manner a rumor that ex-Presi
dent Cleveland had died while on a fishing jaunt at Middle Bass Island
gained currency this afternoon, and to-night the telegraph offices here
and at other lake points were swamped with messages asking for infor
mation. For hours it was impossible to get news from the island to re
lieve the anxiety. Finally, at 11 o'clock to-night, the steamer State of
New York arrived, and Harry Scribner, a prominent attorney of this
city, who was with Mr. Cleveland at 4 o'clock, reported that the ex-
President was enjoying good health at that time.
PRINCETON, N. J., May 14.â A telegram has reached Mrs. Grover
Cleveland from Sandusky, Ohio, stating that Mr. Cleveland is all right.
A special from Sandusky says the steamer Arrow arrived at 10:50 from
the island. The captain said he saw Mr. Cleveland at 9 o'clock to-night.
He was then alive and well.
DENIES THAT Y\E IS DEAD.
TOLEDO O. May 14. â The special tug: sent to Middle Bass Isla.id
last night to 'confirm or deny the rumor of the :.::. of ex-President
Cleveland reached Sandusk - a few r.-.1.-vtes before 2 o'clock. Mr. Cleve
land is alive and very well indeed. When informed of the rum >rs of
his death he was much provoked and said: "It is simply absurd." He
turned around and walked into the clubht use.
HAS FAITH IN
GENERAL GOMEZ
Rumors Do Not Alarm
Brooke.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, May 14.â General Gomez has
sent a message to Governor General
P.rooke that he will call at headquarters
to-morrow for a further conference re
garding the payment of the Cuban troops.
The appointment for the interview is the
result of a direct inquiry as to what Gen
eral Gomez intended to do in view of
the resignation and non-appearance of
all the Cuban officers nominated by him |
to represent the several corps in the dis
tribution of the $3,000,000.
General Brooke, it is said, has deter
mined to disregard for the present the i
reports that reach him from various j
sources as to the alleged intention of j
Gomez to withdraw his co-operation and
thus throw into confusion the careful'y
matured plans for distributing the lund.
It la believed that the personal interview
I to-morrow ought to adjust the matter
j and to point the way out of the ter
n: porary perplexity. He is unwilling to
i consider Gomez as insincere or as acting
in bad faith. The Governor General, how-
I ever, still retains the discretion. reposed in
i him by President McKinley to abandon
; the effort to disband the late insurgents
' with the gratuity and to send back the
j enttre amount to the United States.
The Cuban General Rafael Rodriguez,
speaking for General Gomez to-day, said
the reports of a difference with General
Brooke were absolutely untrue. The at
-1 tltude of Gomez, he declared, had under
; gone no change, and the principal gen
erals of the Cuban army, as well as the
rank and file, continued to support Go
i mfz as they always had. He explained
! that all the talk about a revolt in the
army against the surrendering of the
\ anna was the work of members of the
i former military assembly, "a group of
1 malcontents behind Manuel Sanguilly,
! who can give considerable trouble."
A report is in circulation this evening
i that the Cuban Colonel Agurdina. who
has been employed in the preparation of
the Cuban army lists, has been detected
padding the rolls so as to defraud the
distributors. The military authorities,
however, deny the report.
General Gomez called upon friends in
Havana to-day and attended services in
1 memory of Captain Esvironde. who was
! killed two years ago at Cienfuegos.
MAJOR MARCHAND TO
BE WARMLY WELCOMED
Frenchmen Glad to Find Some Army
Officers Who Deserve
Homage.
Sperial Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1599. by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, May 14.â Pari shad a brief scarp
this week owing to the publication of the
report that Major Marcharul, now on his
way from Harrar to Djibouti, had been
assassinated. It is true that the report
did not meet with general credence
and was soon denied, yet the
incident served to bring to light the
warm feelings with which Frenchmen
regard the heroic explorer. His return to
France is exciting intense interest
throughout the country. Marehand will
probably reach France in the second
week in June. His mission is due at
Djibouti about the 20th, but already tele
graphic Invitations to receptions and
banquets are being showered upon him.
The Cercle Militaire has just received
Marchand's acceptance of an invitation
to a grand military fete to be held in his
honor in Paris. The general impression ob
tained from editorials of the Paris papers
is that Frenchmen, feeling that certain i
prominent army officers -have not shown to ;
advantage in the Dreyfus case, are glad
of an opportunity of honoring before the
world an officer of whom they can be
justly proud. Another officer who is
"likely to profit from this state of the
public mind is General Gallien). now on
his way home from Madagascar, where
his energetic, soldierlike administration
has done much for the colony and has
provoked the admiration of his country
men.

$â¢1000 the total value of the estate so far
as known being $10,000. It is thought
Cook must have had another secret place
wherein he deposited money.

NEW YORK. May 14.â Lord Charles
Beresford's new book, "The Break-Up
of China," just issued, marks a new
epoch In the much-discussed question
of trade in the far East, because for
the first time the people of the United
f States have set before them a calm,
straightforward statement of the situ
ation in the East to-day, of the diffl-
A rulties that beset the foreign merchant
In China, and of the close connection
that exists there between diplomatic
and political affairs.
Lord Beresford visited the principal
cities alone: the Chinese coast. After
making inquiries, receiving opinions
and talking with British, American and
German merchants in the different
oities, he is of the opinion that unless"
the policy of "The Open Door" is en
â  forced in China in the near future, it is
more than probable that the Chinese
Empire will be completely broken up
and partitioned among the European
powers. The "sphere-of-influence"
method of partitioning China is, in his
opinion, dangerous, since it constantly
causes international complications
which disturb trade. To-day France,
Germany and Russia are all in posses
sion of certain portions of the Chinese ;
Empire, each of which portion is under '
what is called the "influence" of its
governmentâ that is, trade with that
particular territory is limited to
Frenchmen, Germans or Russians, as ,
the case may be. If this policy is en
larged, there are many difficulties like- |
ly to follow, not the least of which will ,
be strained relations between the Eu- j
ropean powers, not only in regard to
commerce and trade, but in the matters j
of bound. and of government. On
the other hand, If the integrity of the
Chinese Empire Is maintained, and the
<â¢ ntire country thrown open to the trade |
* <.f all nations, the resources of China
are likely to benefit the whole world.
The author's recommendation is that
some method be adopted by which the j
Chinese army shall be organized under
one head, drilled and trained by Euro
pean officers and fitted to maintain or
der and protect personal property and
life, whether of foreigners or natives,
within the empire, and that the mer
chants of any or all nations be allowed
equal rights to carry on commerce and
trade with all others as in the civilized
countries of the earth. He sees less
need for the Increase and training of
the navy, as the difficulties and hind
rances to commerce in China to-day are
internal rather than external. These
hindrances are classified by the reports
received from Chinese officials and for-,
eign residents under the general heads
of antiquated Chinese systems of du
ties and tolls exacted on all the rivers
running from one province to another
and along the coast- the extraordinary
amount of piracy which flourishes on
all the waterways; the difficulty of re
ceiving fair treatment at the hands of
the Chinese inhabitants, who distrust
' any plans for Increasing trade, and the
political complications arising from the
control of special territories by Euro
pean powers. __

THE SAN FTtAN CISCO CALL., MONDAY, MAT 15, 1899.
INCREASES THE
CUBAN BURDEN
Claims for Damages
From Foreigners.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, May 14,â The State
Department has been informally advised
that claims aggregating a considerable
amount have been made by British,
French and German residents Jn Cuba j
during the recent insurrection and that i
these ultimately will be pressed against
the United States Government. The
claims themselves have not yet been pre
sented, but are being collected by the
several foreign offices as the claimants
send them in. In some cases schedules
have been made and the aggregate stated
to the authorities here. The French
claims aggregate between 12,000,000 and
15,000,000 francs. The German claims are
understood to be slightly under those of
the French, while British claims are sajd
to be considerably more than either the
French or German.
These foreign claims are quite distinct
from those of the citizens of the United
States originally against Spain for dam
ages sustained in Cuba during the insur
rection. The peace treaty specifically
provided for these American claimants,
releasing Spain and stating that the
United States would make such settle
ment as was proper. Under this clause
claims aggregating several millions have
been filed. No provision, however, was
made by the treaty for foreign claimants
and there appears to be much doubt as
to who is liable since the sovereignty
over Cuba has passed from the hands of
Spain. The United States having under
taken to look after the American claims,
the foreigners are desirous of being
treated in the same manner. It was
stated at one of the foreign establish
ments that there was no disposition to
push the claims unduly, but to bring
them to the attention of the United
States Government in order that the
question of liability might be determined
and such relief granted as the merits of
the cases warranted. It is appreciated
in these foreign quarters that payments
will bo largely a matter of discretion
with the United States, as the obligation
to look after the American claimants was
assumed voluntarily, and there is no obli
gation, either in the treaty or on gen
eral principles of law, for assuming the
claims growing out of Spain's inability
to maintain order in Cuba during the
period of Spanish rule.
These foreign claims cover damages to
plantations, personal property, etc., of
French, British and German residents of
Cuba, and are not connected with the
bonded debt of Cuba in foreign hands,
which debt was assumed in Spain.

GALE MAKES TROUBLE
ABOARD THE LIGHTSHIP
BROKE HER MOORINGS AND CAME IN.
THE gale which came whistling through the Golden Gate yesterday afternoon and set everything movable awhirl
made things lively outside the heads. When it was at its fiercest the lightship broke away from her moorings
and began to drift. An effort was made to bring her back, but the sea was too high and the captain finally de
cided to run her into the bay and wait until the weather moderated. She came inside the heads at just about
nightfall and puzzled the lookouts at the Merchants' Exchange for a few minutes. They finally made out the
strange-looking craft to be the ship which should be doing duty outside. She came into the harbor just as though she
belonged there and anchored off Meiggs Wharf. An effort was made to send a boat out and see if all was well aboard,
but the sea was running so high that it was impossible to launch a Whitehall.
The lightship San Francisco, No. 70, was sent out in the latter part of March, IS9B, to take the place of the old whist
ling buoy. She is under command of Captain A. J. Lowell and carries a crew of eleven men. Eacb man is allowed a
month's leave of absence after three months' service, and all will probably welcome the unexpected trip to the city.

HE FEARED DEATH
BUT HE SOUGHT IT
o ' Â°
TOE ROSS, a young man who makes his summer home at Belvedere with +
"*" his parents, had an experience yesterday that he will not forget as long o
Â° tJ as he lives. He was blown out into the bay in a small skiff and the agony 4.
+ v of waiting for what he considered an inevitable death became so great O
Â° that to end his misery he jumped overboard. Luckily help was at hand and +
"*" Joe was saved from a watery grave. O
Early in the day Ross went down to Tiburon and hired a small skiff to q
Â£ paddle around in the smooth water near the ferry slips. As he pulled around +
+ he gained confidence and got further and further from the shore until the o
O wind and tide took possession of the skiff and carried it out into the bay. +
+ Joe yelled and waved his handkerchief, but no one noticed his predica- O
O ment. "*"
+ Past Angel Tsland drifted the boat, gathering way as she got into the full +
9 force of the blast. Alcatraz hove in sight and Joe tried again and again to ?
q attract the attention of the soldiers on the island, but all in vain. Every few q
+ minutes he would stop waving his signals of distress, but he was so rattled +
O that he tried to row against both wind and tide instead of using both of them O
â â¦â¢ to help him in to the wharves. "â¦"
O As he passed Fishermen's wharf three Italian fishermen saw the lad's
q predicament and at once started to his assistance. At the same time Oscar q
+ A. Tolle, a clerk in the County Clerk's office, and J. K. Martiny got into a +
0 Whitehall and started to the rescue. Before the fishermen were well under q
a way Tolle, who is an old yachtsman, had made sail on the Whitehall and was +
o racing toward the skiff. In the meantime Captain Leale on the ferry steamer o
Newark had seen the boy's frantic signaling and stopping the steamer pre- a
O pared to lower a boat. He saw the Whitehall coming, however, and got un- o
a der way again. +
o When Ross saw the steamer proceeding he thought his last hour had o
a come. He got down on his knees in the bottom of the boat and began to +
O pray. Then the men in the Whitehall saw him get to his feet and the next o
>â  moment spring overboard. The water must have been too cold or something, -f
O because as soon as Joe rose to the surface after his plunge he swam back O
+ to the skiff and held on. A few minutes later the Whitehall was alongside
Â° and Tolle pulled the shivering lad into it. Tolle and Martiny then rowed in 2
to the Folsom street steps and landed Ross. As soon as Joe found himself +
2 on firm ground again he got down on his knees and said "Thank God, I'm O
O saved." Then he took to his heels and ran to the Tiburon ferry and caught >
+ the 3:30 p. m. boat for home. Tolle and Martiny took the skiff in tow and Â°
O towed it back to Fishermen's wharf, where Joseph can get it to-day if he so "*"
+ desires.

"Old Paths Methodistic."
â¢ At the Howard Street Methodist Epis
copal Church yesterday morning the pas
tor, Rev. Dr. John A. B. Wilson, preached
the third of a series of sermons on "Old
Paths Methodistic." The fundamental
principles as announced by its founder
and that which underlie the system were
examined into as to their Biblical char
acter, the philosophy of their relation to
American Methodistic growth and as an
inspiration for future effort and sacrifice.
His text was Jeremiah vi:l6â"Stand ye
in the way and seek and ask for the old j
paths," etc.
The immediate principle under examina
tion was the declaration of Wesley when j
thrust out of the churches of the estab
lishment of whii.ii he was a minister.
"The world is my parish," he said. |
"You may find fault with Methodism, but I
it yet remains to be accounted for. It
has made mo broad enough to rejoice in
the success of every other body of be
lievers. But with its severest of all con
ditions found in modern Christianity
Methodism has yet proven true to human
nature, and so divine in its origin, so
Biblical in its teachings and methods, that
in 133 years of its origin it has grown to
6 000 000 of actual communicants and 24,
--000.000 of the population; divided into six
teen branches upon questions of govern
ment but separated by no fundamental
principle of doctrine. Our own Methodist
Episcopal Church, the parent stem of
American Methodism, numbers to-day
3 000 000 members and 12.000,000 adherents;
17 468 pastors, J. 5,000 local preachers, 2G.114
churches. And so, far from ancient,
Methodism Is more potential than
modern. Of these great numbers the last
thirty-four years have added 10.293 minis
ters, 16,073 churches. 2,000,000 of communi
cants and of adherents 8.000,000, while
2,700,000 Sunday school scholars are being
trained at her altars, and property values
have increased from $35,000,000 to $163,000,
--000." :: w: : :

An Unknown Body Found.
The body of an unknown man was
found at 6 o'clock yesterday morning
in the bay at Broadway wharf by
Watchman Malcolm. When seen the body
was lying alongside the steamer Uma
tilla. From the appearance of the fea-
tures of the dead man it was surmised
that he had not been long dead. He is
about 45 years of age, 5 feet 10 inches in
height, weighs about 160 pounds, dark
hair turning gray. He wore a dark sack
coat with checked linings, black vest
white standing collar and black necktie
The Coroner was notified and the body
was removed to the Morgue.
The indolent man is the first to claim
that he never had an opportunity.

DEPARTURE OF
A. WHITE BROWN
CAUSES GRIEF
Young Swell Suddenly
Disappears.
UNPAID BILLS LEFT BEHIND
FAMILIAR FIGURE THAT GRACE!
THE LINE.
Led a Torrid Life and Contracted
Very Many Debts During
His Visit to This
City.
With the exodus of the turfmen A
White Brown of decorative appearanci
has disappeared from this city, leaving
an army of tradesmen and other unsus
pecting people full of wrath and strong
intentions to invoke the law to come te
their assistance. For several month!
Brown, who was a figure on the line and
at the racetrack, has played false witk
men of easy confidence and women whosi
hearts were easily pierced by his soft
suave manner.
Among his frtends A. White Brown wai
known as "Browny." Never in his Sat
Francisco career was he known to com
mit a breach of the fantastic proprietiei
of dress. When he first arrived in thfi
city he took apartments at the Palace,
but as soon as he became established
there he moved to another but none thÂ«
less luxurious environment. Three hours
a day he would exhibit himself in the
Palace court, appareled in multi-colorec
clothes of the most perfect fit. His onl>
seeming occupation was the consumptior
of ornate and highly scented cigarettes
and the consistent changing of his dress.
His credit was good on the line and off
Haberdashers, tailors, restaurateurs, sa
loon men, even bookmakers, invited hire
to try their wares, and Brown obliginglj
accepted their invitations. From the Clifl
House to the Oakland track the young
New Yorker was a most familiar tigure
Not to know him was to argue yoursel!
unknown. Just at present there are a
number of people in this city who arÂ«
most anxious to know one other thing
and that is how can the departed Mr
Brown of New York be reached. They arÂ«
waving bills in their hands, and thej
would very much like to receipt them
What is particularly galling to the wrath
ful creditors is that Brown has left thÂ«
city so unceremoniously. Some of then:
are confident that their bills against hiir
would have been paid had they had an
opportunity to present them. Others are
not so sanguine, and they are now burn
ing incense for the departed and inci
dentally perfecting themselves in a dic
tion that is not found in the standard dic
tionaries.
Brown came to San Francisco with thÂ«
best of reputations. He is a young man
of large, liquid blue eyes and a complex
ion that was the envy of the tenderloin
district. He was given cards to some ol
the prominent clubs in this city, being
a frequent guest at the Union League.
His money, which was spent free
ly on all kinds of amusements, was
thought to be unlimited. Upon his arriv
al he was introduced to the electric-lighi
contingent as the son of the celebrated
manufacturer of cough medicines ami
troches, and was supposed to be im
mensely wealthy. At any rate, his pock
ets were always heavy with clinking
money.
Brown did not leave without an ordei
for the forwarding of his mail. His let
ters are to be sent to St. Louis, where
he will pass a short vacation. Otherwise
they must be mailed to his home in New
York. Mr. Brown will receive a hearty
welcome upon his return to this city.
A CHANCE FOB CALIFORNIA.
Failure of the Fruit Crop of the South
Should Bring Good Prices.
That there has been a good deal more
frost in the fruit districts of the South
than the growers have been willing to ad
mit is the opinion of T. M. Ferguson, who
has Just returned from a trip to Cuth
bert, Ga., his birthplace.
"I rode for miles through peach orch
ards," said Ferguson, "and I have
talked with the leading fruit growers in
the southern part of Georgia, They all
say there will be no peach or orange croc
this year, and that all the fruit that
would otherwise have been ordered from
Georgia must now come from California.
It has been the coldest spring the South
has ever experienced. In January the ther
mometer went down as far as three de
grees below zero, and fifteen or twenty
above zero is as cold as the weather has
ever been down there. Old shade trees
that I remember from the time I was a
boy have been killedâ that is, not killed
outright, but all the shoots and branches
are dead and the trees have to start
again with shoots from the trunk.
"The orange crop is also frozen and
there will not be oranges enough in the
South to pay for the picking. Where the
output in oranges and peaches used to be
thousands of carloads, there is now no
prospect of furnishing the section with
fruit enough to eat. If Georgians want to
eat peaches this summer they will have to
be purchased in California: and if Florida
people want to eat oranges they will have
to be from California. There is no fruit
in the South, and the place it occupied in
the Eastern market will have to be taken
by California fruit. It ought to be a good
year for the fruit growers of this State."

CURRENT COMMERCIAL CONDITIONS.
THERE was less feature to general trade last
week. The gain in bank clearings fell off to 43.7
per cent over the same week last year, whereas
il preceding weeks it was much more pro
nounced. But as l"ng a<- the country can show a
gain in business of 43 per cent it cannot complain of
trade condition?. The commercial failures were 169.
as compared with 250 for tire corresponding week a
year ago. For a year or more the failures have stead
ily decreased, showing either greater conservatism
in business or a much more prosperous condition of
trade â probabiy both.
The reports from sll over the country are generally
favorable. The chief features are advanced quota
tions for many descriptions of iron and steel, in
creased activity in building, as shown by heavy sales
vi lumber at rising prices, larger railway earnings, a
firmer tone in cotton goods and an advance of 10 per
cent in hides at Chicago, with receipts of cattle in four
Months of 100,000 head less than during the same
period last year, and over 200,000 less than in 1803-4.
in spite of the gain in population. Offsetting these
favorable signs, however, we have a quieting down
in the wholesale distributing demand, notably for dry
s and clothing, and a further weakening in cereal
values in the face of less promising crop conditions.
The export of wheat shows some falling off. the fig
ures for the past week being 3.284.000 bushels, against
.?.. 484,000 for the same week in 1898. though the ex
ports thus far this crop year are 203,058.000 bushels,
against 202.523.000 last year. In opposition to this
is the marked increase in the production of iron and
steel, which has averaged during the past four months
.'8.027 tons daily, against 32,209 last year.
There was a decline in manufacturing stocks in
Wall street during the week, but it was not due. as
many supposed, to any decline in industries, but to the
overbought condition of the market. Stocks accumu
lated on the hands of speculators who figured on a
me. and as it failed to materialize they naturally sold.
We are told, however, that the public taste for specu
lation in industrials is not yet sated, as shown by the
recent subscription of $412,000,000 to the $75,000,000
stock in the new copper combine, while the rejected
subscriptions raised the figure to about $1,000,000,000.
Meanwhile the money market continues easy, the sup
ply of funds showing a notable increase, while interest
rates are easier.
In the local market the leading features are con
tinued activity in all kinds of provisions at very firm
prices, a similar condition in the live stock market, a
good demand for wool, an advance in lumber and
unusually high prices for fresh fruit, which is in sharp
demand in the Eastern markets. As high as $8 25
per ten-pound box has been paid for California cher
ries in the New York market, and sales at $5 and $6
are of daily occurrence. The fruit reports fail to state
what class of people in New York eat cherries at 60
cents to 80 cents per pound. They evidently have>
money tp burn. We are glad they haye â they may
have our cherries. Another Eastern buyer came out
here a few days ago and bought 150 carloads of last
year's prunes. Shut your eyes and imagine the length
of a train of 150 cars of prunes and you will get a
fair idea of the size of this little transaction. This will
be a great year for California fruit.
We are doing a pretty good business all around
out here in California. The wholesalers in all lines
are busy and the dealers in farming tools report a
great rush for extra parts' of harvesting machines,
which point- to large crops. Never have trade condi
tions extended more promise. The export trade of
San Francisco and the northern coast ports is too
active for the number of steamers employed, and more
arc needed, especially on the Panama and Oriental
routes. Indeed, sailing vessels have been found
necessary to supplement the steamers. Coastwise lum
ber freights have advanced in sympathy with grain
rr.tes, and, in brief, the shipping and export business
of the port are on a very satisfactory basis.
A witness who appeared the other day before the
Washington Industrial Commission, which is making
an inquiry into the operation of trusts, said he knew
of men who are paid a bonus for being idle. That wit
can win an eternal place in the esteem of man
kind if he will give the secret away.
And some people will not believe yet that the Cu
banj are Americanized. According to latest advices
150,000 of them are applicants for office under Uncle
THE SECRET RAILROAD DOSSIER.
THE exposure in The Call of yesterday of the
revision of the report originally prepared by
Railroad Commissioner Blackstock in reference
to the "grain case," so called, pending before the
Circuit Court of the United States, is prosaically as
tounding and reveals such shameless corruption upon j
the part of the principal counsel for the railroad and
Commissioners Blackstock and Laumeister as noth- j
ing but the experience of the last thirty years would I
accredit. The fact that, through its false assertion of j
its complete withdrawal from politics last year, the
railroad was enabled to handle both sides of a pending
litigation would be in itself an insufferable degrada- j
tion. But the proof now furnished that William F. |
Herrin actually dictated not merely the treacherous J
action of the two Commissioners controlling' the pro- j
ceedings of the board, but the very terms in which i
their corruption was ultimately expressed, transcends
ail the revelations of which there is any accessible
record.
Commissioner Blackstock, in his report as first pre
pared, evidently supposed that he was accomplishing
the purpose for which he was elected. But in framing i
an argument to sustain his contemplated misconduct |
his astuteness was hot equal to the exigencies of the
situation. The railroad, in invoking the equitable as
sistance of the Circuit Court of the United States, as ;
it was constituted when the suit was commenced, had
tendered issues of the most comprehensive character,
going to the foundation of the powers of the Railroad
Commission and which, if sustained, would have
bound the State hand and foot. In its bill of com
plaint not only was the horizontal reduction of 25 per ,
cent assumed to have been perfected so far as the i
commission had the right to act, but the entire rail
road schedule was treated as so completely fair and
reasonable, and even so generous to the public and so |
parsimonious toward itself, that it was beyond any
possible interference, even though the plenary author- j
ity of the commission had been conceded. The Com
missioners, moreover, under the guidance of their
able and faithful special counsel, backed by the Attor
ney General of the State, raised questions affecting i
the validity of the attempted concentration of railroad
interests in the Southern Pacific Company of Ken
tacky and asserted the existence of fictitious and
fraudulent elements in the basis adopted by the rail
road, upon which fair and reasonable returns upon
the investment were to be computed. When the or
iginal injunction was restricted to the grain rates, |
which covered a reduction of 8 per cent. Judge Me- |
Kenna acted upon the affidavit of the Railroad Com- ;
missioners then in office to the effect that the resolu- j
tion altering the rates horizontally had not been fol
lowed by a schedule, which was necessary for its com
pletion, and that there was no existing intention of
further proceedings in that direction.
Notwithstanding the modification of the provisional ;
injunction, however, the issues offered by the railroad
remained in the case for trial and for decision. When
Commissioner Blackstock framed his report he was
not sufficiently comprehensive to satisfy the railroad 'â 
on the proposition that all the questions embraced
in the litigation except that of the grain rate had been
completely settled. That question had become com- j
parativcly unimportant, as the competition of the San j
Joaquin Railroad and other causes, influencing Hunt
ingtori's policy, had led to voluntary reductions, j
which, as we understand the fact, amounted on the
average to about 5 per cent. In this report also Com- !
missioner Blackstock prominently alluded to an oral j
application for a compromise made to the commission
by the railroad some years ago, the substance of
Which was that if the 25 per cent resolution was re
scinded the railroad would dismiss its suit. Finally
he suggested that the entire action of the commission. !
as prevjously constituted, embracing the 8 per cent
grain rate, should be repealed and the present com
mission be left footloose to deal with the question of j
rates de novo.
The expurgated and revised edition of Commission- ;
er Blackstock's report, molded by William F. Herrin \
to suit the wishes of the railroad, duplicates much of
the original, but is designed: First, to show that, un
der Judge McKenna's decision on the provisional in
junction, the commission was effectually and perma- ;
.ient!y estopped from raising the most vital proposi- j
tions that naturally arose under the bill of complaint
at filed; second, to avoid the necessity of any explana
tion of the surreptitious attempt to compromise, j
which the railroad declined to formulate in writing, !
although requested to do so by Commissioner La
Roe and the special counsel of the Commission; third,
that there was nothing left in the case but the grain !
rate of 8 per cent, which had become immaterial and i
superfluous; and, fourth, that the enormous expense I
of a trial justified the commission in sacrificing the ;
$43,000 already spent. In this way the ground was |
cleared so that the foundation might be laid for a new I
litigation of equal duration and of similar complexity, |
in which the whole work would have to be repeated, j
The central point was that the suit before Judge Mor- j
row was to be ended by the commission itself, with
out any apparent participation upon the part of the
complainant, and the railroad hands untied so that it
might proceed with fresh aggressions upon the rights
and the interests of the public.
A reflected light is thrown upon this treacherous
and infamous conduct by the repeated declarations of
Mr. Huntington that the railroad traffic would have
to pay the entire indebtedness of the Central Pacific !
Railroad Company, as finally adjusted with the Fed- \
eral Government. But far more disgusting than any
matter of dollars and cents is the proof that in this
State and in this country it is possible for the sanctity
of the courts to be invaded without their own conniv
ance, and both sides of a great legal controversy, in
volving the deepest principles, to be controlled by a
railroad attorney, using the virtue of hospitality as a
cover for the crime of official infidelity to sworn duty,
to individual pledges and to the vital necessities of the
commonwealth.
ORATORICAL MR. HUNTINGTON.
THE speech of Mr. C. P. Huntington on last
Saturday night to his own employes and to his
trusted friends was not quite up to the standard
of Mr. W. H. Mills. This does not imply that it was
actually composed or written by Mr. Mills, although
the "masters, lords and rulers in all lands" frequently
employ their prime ministers to do such work for
| them. But Mr. Huntington's life having been prin
cipally occupied with business activities, he has had
| no leisure for the cultivation of literature, as was
fully exemplified in what are known as the "Colton
letters," and, therefore, it has been noticed for years
that, when he uses social occasions to convey his ideas
to the public, as closely as possible he follows the
style of Mr. Mills. This accounts for his occasional
references to ancient and to modern history and to
other sources of information that to a hard-headed
railroad manager are necessarily recondite.
But Mr. Huntington this year has talked too much.
His tenth speech was certainly his worst. In his first
paragraph he made a mistake of fact which any of his
subordinates could have corrected and which was a
bad example for young men. In a touching adapta
tion of the conference of the witches in "Macbeth,"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 15, 1899.
"when shall we three meet again," he observed, "With
the year passes the century." Mr. Huntington should
have known better. Any one of the callow youths
seated around his table, to whom he so frequently and
j tenderly referred, could have told him that the twen
; tieth century does not begin until January I, ioo 1
j He was a long way ahead of time, a serious fault in
I railroading, for which there is no precedent in any
of the lines with which he is connected.
But, in many other and important respects, Mr.
Huntington for once was unfortunate. He was speak
ing in a fine house, not equal to his New York man
sion, but still fine and surrounded by other fine
houses, all of which taken together have dedicated the
crest of Nob Hill to railroad and mining opulence.
He reached out in every direction for more fields for
the indulgence of his ruling passion for saving and
gaining. Cheap labor as usual was his hobby, but he
proposes to secure it now by investing the Filipinos
with American citizenship. The order of his sen
tences is not precisely the order of his ideas and there
fore we may be pardoned for bringing detached parts
oi his oracular utterance together. After speaking of
the American republic as having set "her foot upon
the threshold" of Eastern Asiatic trade and having
recommended a close alliance between the oldest and
the youngest nation, he added: "I do not see why
we should be any more afraid of the Chinaman than
the people of other countries are, and they will wel
-1 come him as a factor in their development." For a
I great many years the people of this coast and for ten
or twelve years the people of the United States have
I not agreed with Mr. Huntington, and with decided
! unanimity they have rejected the Chinese factor in
i their industrial progress and have also secured legis
lation that has long been more or less effective.
Isn. however, the United States becomes the new
:mpire r.nd introduces its fresh leaven into Chinese
erialism, while it joins hands with the other des
c powers of the globe, doubtless it will matter
little what citizenship thinks or what its interests
and, for the repeal of the exclusion laws may not
lire Congressional sanction,
has often been remarked that Mr. Huntington
the courage of his interests, always identical with
convictions. His views on Asiatic expansion,
efore, are even more pronounced than the si
lenced advocates of a "national policy" ever promul-
Jited. He believes that the only way to destroy
mcricanism is to adulterate it. Consequently he is
ptirely clear in favor of taking the Philippines into
c Union and throwing the Filipinos into the body
our free population. Having some connection
ith Africa and having studied the uses of "spheres of
Huence," he proposes that his own country shall im
mediately become a convert to that method for the
j partition of the world. "Strange peoples," he says,
"are to come more into our life and these peoples,
by and by, are going to render a verdict on our
trial." That is to say, the ten millions of our Filipino
fellow citizens will ultimately determine whether our
Itivation of an Asiatic "sphere of influence has
n successful. And of the fact that they are well
ilified for absorption into our composite race, Mr.
ntington has no doubt: "The Filipinos have
iwn us that they do not lack independence of spirit,
irage. determination and pereverance. These are
qualities that make good citizenship in a repub-
It is not strange that Mr. Huntington delivered a
mock rhapsody on equality before the law, which rail
road litigation has so pointedly illustrated and which,
in his estimation, as shown by his acts rather than by
hi? words, means the destruction of American nation
ality between the upper millstone of speculative mo
nopoly and the nether millstone of Mongolian Ameri
canism. Looking at all these questions from a purely
money-getting point of view, it was also quite natural j
for him to complain of "higher education for the i
masses." The time spent by young men between 16
and 21 in studying the institutions and the history of
tir country and in learning to revere the great
nders of organized liberty on this continent is time
: from the acquisition of that practiced smartness
t would enable them to save pennies and to expand
m into eagles, ready to be deposited in the capa
cious pockets wide open to receive them.
Seated around the lucky horseshoe table that minis
tered to American simplicity were gifted and learned
men whose mental digestion must have been superb
if they absorbed and assimilated the whole of the im
perial feast presented to them by Mr. Huntington.
The tyrannical domination of the American con
querors is beginning to torture in Cuba. The Mayor
of Havana, under direction of the American Military
Governor, has issued a decree to certain classes of the
population commanding them, under pain of severe
punishment, to wear costumes at least somewhat more
elaborate than undershirts. It appears that the Cv-
Es have been slightly negligent in matters of attire,

ried away parts of the old log house, almost demol

of Santiago thousands have been trying to tear the
old soldier himself to pieces. There is sometimes a
difference before and after.
It is a safe wager that not one man out of ten even
in the most intelligent circles can tell offhand how
many capitals have been taken from the Filipinos
since the advance began. In fact a good many pro
fessional critics of the war have lost. their scorecards

NEWS OF THE MINES.
That long-hoped-for and ever deferred
report of the California Debris Commis
sion on how the $500,300 voted for restrain
ing dams should be spent will probably
be forthcoming this summer. The Fed
eral engineers do not discuss the pros
pects of the report or the progress of their
investigation, but it may be stated that
there is little or no doubt that an ex
tensive and detailed report on this par
ticular matter will accompany their annu
al report, which is supposed to be ready
in July.
This is very cheering as far as it goes.
Whether or not the report will be very
cheering cannot be told. Mining interests
wanting some larger practical results
from Congressional and State legisla
tion, secured with great effort years ago,
have naturally been Jmpatient at the very
long delay. The attitude of many has
been, "Get In and spend the money some
how," but Federal engineers are gener
erally very self-possessed, and the Cali
fornia Debris Commission has used Its
own time any way. The fact that the
three engineers composing the commission
A Typical Private Restraining Dam for Hydraulic Mining in a Moun
ta\n Canyon as Approved by the Federal Engineers.
have also had in hand all the other ex- !
tensive Government work of the coast,
including harbors, fortifications and war
work, gives the main explanation -for the ;
delay.
However, the commission took hold of
the matter about eighteen months ago
and since then investigations have been
vigorously pursued mainly by Hubert
Vischer, who has been an assistant en
gineer in this employ for several years.
Part of Mr. Vlacher's time has been given
to inspecting private restraining dams
licensed by the commission, but he has
been mainly employed in surveys which '
have reference to the restraining of de
bris in the tributaries of the Sacramento.
His attention lias been given principally
to the Yuba, which has so great a deposit
of tailings along its "nod. Extensive sur
veys have been made at the Narrows and
at Dc GuejTe Point, above Marysville.
At the former place a series of borings
showed that bedrock was about eigtaty
five feet below the river bed and that a
dam there would jonsume most of the
$500,000. Incidental attention has been
given to the attitude of property-owners
and the cost of land used or submerged.
Besides the study of dam sites close topo
graphical and other studies of the Yuba
have been made from the Narrows to
Marysville, a distance of forty miles.
Years ago the condition of this* stream.
the amount of debris in It, the relation of
its debris to flow and overflow, etc.. were |
carefully studied. It is probable that the
information of the past will be collated
and supplemented by that recently gained,
so that the report will be an interesting
and important one â¢â¢oncerning the condi
tion of the Yuba. The possibilities of a
partial diversion of the Yuba will be dis- !
cussed among other things.
Mr. Vincher is now spending much of i
his time in that field while working up a i
voluminous report, which will be consid
ered by Colonel Mansfield, Major Hucur '.'
and Lieutenant Dekeayn, and which will
fono the basis of their report. There is j
thus a prospect that the California De- |
bris Commission will soon submit to the |
Chief of Engineers at Washington a
definite and comprehensive report on the
expenditure of $500,000 and the further
needs of the contemplated work.
Mixed up with the problem are the pos
sibilities of electric-power slants at any
I dams which may be built. For instance, a 1
I great dam on tne Yuba at the Narrows a j
hundred or more feet high would have
splendid economic possibilities in this j
line. There lies a small but interesting
! chance for government-ownership people j
I to talk. Smart men have been alert to !
1 this chance from the start, and among
them are the members of two companies,
largely composed of Marysville people, ;
who are waiting with all eyes open for a â 
chance to make money out of any water
power Uncle Sam may create on the
Yuba. They have carefully looked after j
their water rights in such a case and '
such water rights may become of legal
importance in the future.
The California Debris Commission has, '
since the passage of the Caminettl law, '
licensed over 300 miners or -lining com- i
panics to mine by the hydraulic process
behind restraining dams of their own i
construction built on approved plans, in
j spected on completion by a member of
i the commission and inspected at intervals
I afterward. No court or departmental rul- j
ings have so far affected the absolute con- '
trol of the California Debris Commission !
over hydraulic mining within the water- i
sheds of the navigable streams of the !
State. On the Klamath and Trinity rlv- I
ers hydraulic mining remains unrestricted ,
and unregulated.
The dams built on authorized plans and
duly licensed do not represent large in
vestments as a rule, and not all of the
licensed mines are operating; but In the !
aggregate they represent the employment
of many men and a considerable in
crease in the gold output. They are
nearly all built of logs and brush, gen
erally in a canyon not far below the scene
of operations. They are supposed to |
catch and to permanently hold practical- 1
ly all of the tailings, even if they are |
built of wood. The only dams that have j
failed so far have been two or three that
have been blown up with dynamite at
night by placer miners who objected to
the lessened current and the deposit of
gravel near their own claims. The ac
companying picture shows a dam about
filfed with tailings. More logs and brush
are supposed to raise the dam' for further
hydraulic operations.
A convention of the miners of Tuol
umne County will be held at Sonora on
the 20th inst. to organize a county branch
of the California Miners' Association.
At a recent meeting of the stockhold- i
ers of the Gwin mine the following offl- j

The Mountain Copper Company has
made public its second annual report. The
report shows an expenditure of Â£.V2BB in
California and Â£487 in New Jersey during
1898. The net profits amount to f160,230,
against Â£63,145 in 1897. A dividend of 7V6
plr cent has been declared. The Quantity
of ore tak<*n out of the mine was 221,89 a
tons, averaging 8.42 per cent copper or
740 tons per working day, against 160,060
tons, averaging 8.56 per cent copper, or
550 a day in 1897; an increase of 56,830 tons,
or 190 tons a day. The quantity of ore
smelted was 168,541 tons, producing 10. .21
tons copper in matte form, against 97,18,)
tons producing 7238 tons matte in 1597.
This is an increase of 71.356 tons of ore
and 34^3 tons of matte. The quantity of
finished copper marketed was 5273 tons,
against 6025 tons in 1897, an increase of
2248 tons. J. O. DENNY.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The Minin. an armored cruiser in the
Russian navy, of 6136 tons and built in
1878, has been in the hands of dockyard
workmen for a couple of years past, and
when the alterations shall finally be com
\ pleted, some time not yet definitely de
cided upon, the ship will be used for
training purposes.
The keel of the battleship Bulwark was
laid at Devonport on March 20, and twen
ty-one days later the work had pro
gressed so far that several of the water
tight compartments in the double bottom
were tested. At this rate of speed of
! shipbuilding, the British dockyards are
I able to complete a 15,000-ton battleship In
j about twelve months, barring unforeseen
I delays in material, and there is no pri- '
vate shipyards in the United Kingdom to !
approach this record.
On January 1, 1899, there were 31 naval

The Sheldrake, gunboat, has returned i
to Devonport from the first of a series
of trials to test the working of the Bab
cock and Wilcox water-tube boilers, with
which the vessel has been fitted. The first
run, of 1000 miles, was made between
Plymouth and the Isle of Man, under fa
vorable conditions, with three-fourths
I boiler power, and an average of 1500
horsepower was realized. The grate sur-
I face was IS9 square feet, and the heating
rurface 6528 square feet. The coal con
sumption was 12.31 pounds per square fool
of grate surface, and 1.61 pounds per
horsepower. The total amount of coai
used on the run of 1000 miles was 71- f
tons, which is regarded as highly saU.-'v
factory, as the engine-room staff had r\*\
previous experience with this type ol
boiler.
As soon as the vessels built abroad for
the Japanese navy have been completed
the Navy Department intends to have a
series of competitive trial? of the ships
built in the United States, Great Britain,
France and Germany. The recently
formed Japanese Institute of Naval Arch
itects will thus have a good opportunity
of laying before the naval experts of the
world an interesting and instructive re
port of ships' trials.
The Eritish torpedo-boat destroyer Al
batross, built by Thorneycroft, had a pre
liminary trial last month and gave every
indication of coming up to the contract
speed of 32 knots. The wind and sea were
very unfavorable for a speed trial, but
her speed was nevertheless 30.3 knots
against wind and tide and 34.20 knots with
the wind and tide. The Albatross is 227
feet in length, 21 feet 3 inches beam and
displaces 360 tons on a draught of 8 feet
â¢5 inches. The boiler? carried a steam
pressure of 245 pounds during her trial
and the revolutions of the engines aver- L
aged 400.
The British cruiser Ariadne. 11,000 tons,
one of eight sister ships, has passed
through her acceptance trials with suc
cess. The first thirty hours' trial under
one-fifth power gave 375S horsepower, 13.3
knot speed and a coal consumption of
2.05 pounds per horsepower. The eight
hours' natural draught trial under full
power developed 1P. 156 horsepower, StLS
knot speed and a coal consumption of 1.6<?
pounds. The steam pressure was 28S
pounds and the revolutions 119. The Ari
adne was built by Thomson. Clydebank,
the contract exacting 18.000 horsepower
and a speed of 20.75. both of which re
quirements were exceeded.

A SHARP CRITICISM ON
POLICE COURT METHODS
REV. F. C. LEES FEARLESS
UTTERANCES.
He Deplores the Weakness of Judges
and the Worthlessness of Their
Clerks â Other Thoughts.
In a prelude to his regular sermon last
evening the Rev. Frederick C. Lee of the
California Methodist Episcopal Church
delivered a sharp criticism on the ineth
f ods In vogue in the criminal courts. He
j stated that the latter were the refuge of
I criminals. In part he said:
From recent decisions It would appear that
[ those who sit for the upholding of the law and
i for the punishment of crime are laboring
under the delusion that they are the attorney
for the defendant; are on the bench not to
punish crime but to protect it; that the Polloe
Courts are the "'cities of refuge" for rogues
and rascals. Like a certain judge, whose
dough face can be seen upstairs in the Em
porium, they "crucify Christ and release
Barabas. Now Barabas was a robber."
Look at the clerk of the Police Court, so
anxious to accommodate the touts and gam
biers arrested at Ingleside that he went out
there carrying the court In his hat. Look at
Kelly, taking straw bail for the negro Wilson,
, doing court work in the dives and deadfalls of
the very thugs who are violating the law; ac
cepting bonds not worth the ink they were
â written with. Tell me that a Police Judge who
understood his business would not be aware
of such rascality and percentage game with
criminals? Look at the wholesale discharge
of Chinese gamblers and lottery men, arrested
with enough evidence to hang every oneâ if
gambling was a capital offense. Look at the
Jones case. Taking three Judges to try one
case. First, before Judge Moganâ result, dis
agreement; second, Judge Tread well â result,
sickness; third, Groezingerâ result, "three
times and out."
In the police raids on Market street among
the gamblers arrested was one Hoffman. In
â¢side of ten days Hoffman was sent up for six
months, but the proprietor of the den where
the gambling was going on was discharged.
i Huffman was a "vag," the proprietor a "per-
I centage politician" with a pull. Consider the
decision given during the last week by the
"acting" (good word) Justice of the Peace
that the ordinance passed by the Supervisors
: and signed by the Mayor was unconstitutional.
A decision so rank and foul as to lead us to
brlieve that it Issued from the sub-basement
of the City Hall and not from a court room.
Why this uniform tendency and unseemly
haÂ«t>-" on the part of clerks and Judges to
favor the thugs and blacklegs? These law
breakers and criminals are favored and toadied
â¢ every turn. Technicalities twisted in
their behalf but no technicality can count
against them. With their guilt patent to all.
the court takes delight in declaring "Go and
sin some more."
How can one help but feel that the whole
machinery, of our police system from curb to
Itanda for the protection and not for the
punishment of a certain class of criminals. In
place of the law being a terror to the evil
doer thp evil-doer rushes Into court knowing
that there he can find "sanctuary rights"
and any Fixbit police court pettifogger can
stand between him and the punishment he de
serves.
That rrime is on the Increase all over our
land is beyond denial, and I lay the fault at
the doors of our courts â In their delays, retrials
and acquittals of the guilty. What mean
these lynchintrs and mob-murders North as
well as South? They are due to the fact that
the faith of the people in the courts to do Jus
tice and punish crime has bepn shaken, and as
a result men have taken tho law Into their
own hands. Lynch law Ib to be deploredâ but
better lynch law than no law. Better mob
law than allow crime and violence to go un
whipped of Justice.
Ask some old - 49er about the vigilance com
mittee? from '51 to T>6. Ask about old "Fort
Gunny bags," ami find out if therp was any
JuggllnK' with Jurlps, any questioning of the
records, any browbeating by a shyster criminal
lawyer of the Judge who hung Jenkins and
Ptuart. Casey and Cora. Thrpp. taps on the
old engine house bell meant the court was in
session, and woe be to the man who inter
fered!
What we need right here and now Is a
firmer, prompter, rarer administration of law
against crimes of all character and in all our
Whether the law shall act as a de
terrent to crime depends entirely upon the
certainty of its execution, hut our whole Judi
ciary is brought into wpU-mPrltPd contempt
whÂ»n the criminal knows that In thp courts
and behind the law he finds his best protec
tion.
I wonder what influence the new charter and
the coming election had upon these raocUt
"Dogberry decisions?" Verily I believe some
of these "dispensers of Justicp" must have
bÂ«Â»en reading Holy Writ and following literally
the exhortation, "Make to yourselves frlpnds of
the Mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye
are cast out they may receive you."

with it a knife was used by Adolphus

I cia and Simon Garcia Into the patrol
I wagon and booked the three latter with :
! battery, while Bertugo had the honor of
an attempt to commit murder placed
against his name. In the meantime
Ar*na, having had his wounds dressed,
returned to his home, and, finding: no
Gpmbatant worthy of his attention,
Started in to beat his wife and her sis
ter. The ladies ran out of the house,
each blowing a police whistle and call
ing out "murder," "police" and every
other exclamation known by which as
sistance might be brought to their aid.
Officer J. Tuchler heard their cries and
hastened to their assistance. When he
arrived at the house he found Arana
master of the situation. He was soon
j cowed, however, and yanked to the sta-
I tion to keep company with his late ban-
I queting companions. The boisterous
quintet were conveyed to the Central sta
tion, where they were permitted to sleep
off the effects of red wine and embalmed
tamales. __^^_^^_________
SPRING FESTIVAL AND
MOONLIGHT PICNIC
â  : â # â  .
UNITED GERMAN SOCIETIES
â¢ GATHER AT SHELL MOUND.
Six Organizations Join in Giving an
Annual Reunion â Three Thou
sand' People in Attendance.
The eighth spring festival and moon
light picnic of the United German Socie
ties was held at Shell Mound Park yes
terday.. The societi?s represented were:
The Hessen Unterstuetzurigs ' Verein,
Baiern Bund, Schwaben Verein, Badischer
Verein, Sued Deutscher Verein. and Gam
brinus Verein. These six societies have
Joined in having an annual reunion for the
past eight years and the festivals have
always been uniformly successful.
Three thousand people gathered at the
grounds and enjoyed themselves to their
hearts' content. Five hundred little ones
were made happy, each being presented
with a prize, and the grown-up guests
patronized both pavilions/ where dancing
was kept up in full swing until 11 o'clock
last night. All the amusements at I the
park came in for a large share of atten
tion, the wheel of I fortune being especial
ly well favored -in that regard. '
The committees worked hard to insure
the success of the affair, which eclipsed
all former ones given by the joint socie
ties. â ' ; .-â  â â¢ â  â  ;â¢! -r Â£.^.

HOSPITAL FENCE BLOWN DOWN.
The Wind Plays Pranks at the City
and County Institution.
Yesterday's zephyr with its gentle
touch visited the old rotten walls of the
City and County Hospital and In its
course leveled about 100 feet of the fence.
The crash was heard by the inmates
throughout the entire building, and for
a time there was the greatest confusion
among the more helpless of the sick, who
thought that the end of the world had
come. The young interns picked up their
kits and hurried for a safe retreat
through the back doors, while Steward
Edwards looked to his limited stores to
see what effect the racket had on his
store of molasses. Dr. Sussdorf hastened
into his private rooms and picked up a
life preserver. The corps of attendants
rushed into the back yard and got the
hose cart out with extended lines. In the
meantime the night watchman made a
hasty examination of the premises and
reported that nothing worse than a few
rods of the wooden fence had been blown
down. Quiet reigned at once when It was
found that the lower portion of the stone
wall had remained intact.
Out of all the damage done the Hospi
tal proper is the beneficiary, inasmuch as
it will have sufficient tire wood for the
balance of the fiscal year. About $100
will repair the damage done by the little
blast.
STABBED HIS MOTHER.
John Murphy While Drunk Demands
Money and Uses a Penknife.
Mrs. Bridget Murphy, a widow living at i
23 Clara street, was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital at an early hour yesterday
morning to be treated for a knife wound
In her abdomen, which she said was in
flicted by her son John. The wound Is
not serious.
She said that John, who was for some
years an extraman in the Fire Depart
ment and is married, had been drinking
heaviiy for some weeks, and about 1
o'clock yesterday morning he came to her
house with a man named John Brlckley.
He demanded money from her, and she
gave him some. Then he pulled a pen
knife out of his pocket and stabbed her.
The police were searching all day yes
terday for John and his friend Brickley.
but they could not be found.

OAKLAND TAKES
TWO FROM THE
WATSONVILLES
Again Up Among the
Leaders.
PLAYS CHAMPIONSHIP BALL
AFTERNOON GAME THE BEST OF
THE SEASON.
a
Visitors Shut Out, While the Dudes
Score a Single Tally â Frisco
and Sacramento Break
Even.
Oakland made it three straight yester
day, barring a protest, by defeating: Wat-
Eonvllle In the morning and afternoon.
thereby jumping from fourth to second
place, providing Manager Btruve's protest
is disallowed. This protest came in the
afternoon and is a double-barreled shot
at the Dudes. It alleges that the members
of the Oakland team made up a pool be
fore the afternoon game and wagered with
an enthusiastic Watsonvillian that they
would take that contest As a second
cause for complaint he alleges that Fred
l^ange plnyed ball behind the umpire's
Lack in ihc sixth inning and prevented
Hanson from scoring. As for the first
charge. It remains for President Moran
to decide; the second Is childish, for
Lange merely blocked the inner corner
of third base, making Hanson run around
him when the runner attempted to go in
from second on Brockhoff's single to right.
This gave Hurdle plenty of time to get
the ball to Hammond, who effectually
blocked Hanson, cutting him off at least
three feet from satety as he came In on a
slide. It was good ball playing on Veteran
1- red s part and stupid base running on
Hanson's, for the latter, instead of slid
. ing. ought to have "roughed it" under |
the circumstances, seeing that his path
was blocked, and jolted Hammond out of
the way if he could. But such is base
tail.
The morning game was not worth look
. Jng at, unless one considered "Little
tgypt a thing of beauty. Oakland, re
inforced by Johnson, who played first for
(the Athletics last year, and is as good as
the best of them in the position, simply
toyed with the Sugar Beets, killing two
Pitchers and paralyzing the third, and
winning by a score of 10 to 2. Hines
started in to do up packages for the vis
itors. He did the same work for the Ath
letics last year, with indifferent success
In the second inning, after he had given
a base on balls and been touched up for

GERMAN COUNT
UNDER ARREST
Accused of Taking
a Woman's Purse
With Felonious
Intent.
PARL WERNER, who claims he
is a German Count, is locked up
I. In the City Prison charged with
v>^ felony embezzlement.
Werner, who is also known as Max
Webber, recently went to San Jose
and became infatuated with a woman
named Blanche Westbrook. He took
her for a drive, and on their return
to San Jose Werner asked his female
companion for her purse, after prom
ising to take care of it until she re
covered from the "effects" of the
drive. The following day the woman
went in search of Werner, expecting to
get her purse, which contained $18 in
money and two valuable diamond
rings. To her surprise she discovered
that he had left San Jose, taking the
purse and the precious contents with
him.
Miss Westbrook lost no time In hunting up Justice of the Peace Rosen
thai, who after listening to her story issued a warrant for the arrest of
Wrrner on a charge of embezzlement.. The warrant was sent to Chief Lees
and turned over to Detective Anthony to be served. . ... '
Yesterday Anthony located the alleged Count in a house. on Albion ave
nue and took him into custody. Ho was immediately escorted to the City
prison and locked 'up in a cell In default of the necessary bonds. â¢
When questioned, the prisoner denied that he had taken Miss Westbrook* s
purse.
"I had about a hundred dollars In my pocket, and, anxious to have a
good time, I took the train for San Jose. While walking along one of the
principal streets I met Miss Westbrook, whom I have known for. some time.
We had several bottles of wine together, and at her suggestion I; hired a
team and we went for a drive. She became Intoxicated, and thinking she might
lose her pursÂ« I asked her for It, after telling her that I would, return it to
her as soon a 6 she got sober. After we had returned from the drive she
asked me for the purse and I gave It to her. I left San JoÃe that evening
and came, to this city."
. Werner declared that the woman was angry with him on account of hla
refusal to marry her. He claims that he receives a monthly allowance from
Germany, but admits he is frequently compelled to do menial work to ~sup
port himself. The claim that he Is a German nobleman is not believed by the
police.

played ball, and to enumerate the star

by a large crowd of "fans," who followed

Senators Win a Game.
SAN JOSE, May 14.â The San Joscs and
Sacramentos broke even in the two
games they played here yesterday and
to-day. The visitors won to-day, the
soon* being 10 to 3 in their favor. A high
wind and clouds of dust interfered with
the playing. Doyle pitched a fine game
for the Sacramentos. He struck out
seven men, to four by Borchers. Six
costly errors made by the home team
and a failure to connect -with the sphere >
with their bats at critical times tells the
story of their defeat. Truck Egan again
played with the Senators, and San Jose
again protested the game on that ac
count. There was a large attendance.

California Cricketers Defeat Pacifies
After a Close Struggle.
Yesterday the Pacifies met the newly
organized California cricket team for the
first time. The Pacifies went to the bat
first, but none of them except Myers and
Simmonds (the former of whom scored
2S and the latter 16 not out) made any
stand against the bowling of Cookson
and Sloman. Throe wickets were down '
for 45 runs, and the Innings closed for
54. Of the Californias, Dlckenson, who
scored 42. was the only batsman to make
double figures, and the innings ended for i
63 runs. Sewell bowled well for the Pa- 'â¢
clfics taking five wickets for 34 runs.
On going to the wickets for the second
time only Myers and Simmonds made any :
stand against the bowling of Cookson,
who took .five wickets for 3 runs, or an
average of three-fifths of a run per
wicket.
When six wickets had fallen Captain
George Theobald declared the Innings
closed, the total for both innings being 92
runs. California thus had 30 runs to
make to win, and succeeded In doing so
for a loss of four Wickets. California
thus won its first match of its season,
and the Pacifies lost their second. The

CONNEMARA WINS
THE OPEN STAKE
AT UNION PARK
Outclasses Log Boy,
the Runner-Up.
BIG DAY FOR SHORTENDERS
JOHN GRACE ENGAGED TO SUC
CEED JUDGE BULL.
He Forsakes Ingleside for Its Rival.
Santa Ana Dies Suddenly in Her
Kennel After Finishing
a Course.
Connemara won the- open stake at
Union Coursing Park yesterday afternoon
In the presence of nearly 4000 spectators,
the runner-up being I,og Boy. The lat
ter, who won- his preliminary courses in
a creditable manner, although slightly
favored in one or two instances by the
hare, was clearly outclassed in the final
course with the black dog, who was a 6
to 1 favorite. The fact that Connemara
was the stake favorite was one of the
few examples of sound judgment exhib
ited by the talent during the day, for the
short-enders got the flag with distressing
regularity in the preliminary rounds. j.ae
first course of the day proved to be a
regular Waterloo for the favorites, no
less than twelve short-enders displaying
winning form, while in the succeeding
courses the average of wins by the rear
guard was pretty well maintained.
Commodore Nash was the first to upset |
the calculations of the talent, defeating I
Lawrence, a 5 to 1 favorite. For Glory,
at 1 to 5, beat Victor; Las Palmas, at 1
to 4, beat Rollicking Airs; Rosie Clalr, at
3 to 5, beat Kid McCoy; Flying Faster, at
1 to 6, beat Lowlander after a. "no go";
Soubrette beat Emm Pasha at 3 to 5;
Maori Land, at 3 to 5, beat Battleship;
Firm Friend, at 2 to 5, beat Petronius;
Miss Skyrocket, at 1 to 5, beat Golden
Russett; Lady Emma, 3 to 5. beat Patria;
and Santiago beat Minerva, 4 to 5, all in
the lirst round.
A stiff breeze swept over the field and
through the grand stand all day, much
to the discomfort of the spectators. The
hares did not take kindly to the wind,
and the courses as a rule were short,
but the sport was nevertheless exciting. !
John Grace, judge at the Ingleside
Coursing Park, has entered into a con
tract with the Union Coursing Associa
tion whereby he is to act as judge at
Union I'ark. negotiations to that end,
which have been pending for some time
past, having been consummated. The an- j
nouncement was made yesterday after
noon. The exact date when Judge Grace
will assume his official duties is undeter- j
mined for the present, but a decision will 1
probably be arrived at some time this
week. Judge Bull's contract with the!
association does not expire until the Ist !
of September, but he has expressed his !
desire to return to his hom^ in England,!
and it is possible that he may taku advan
tage of the present opportunity, in which j
event Judge Grace will soon be seen on I
the field, where he is surt to meet with a !
warm welcome. James Grace has been I
engaged as slipper.
Santa Ana, the promising' young bitch
owned by R. B. deÃ. Lopez, died sudden
ly in her kennel a few minutes after be
ing brought in from the field after her
course with Log Boy. A rumor gained
circulation that she had been poisoned,
but there seems to be no ground for such
an assumption. Mr. Lopez took Santiago
into the slips, and when he returned I
Santa Ana was dead. She was about 19
months old, and was one of the four San- I
tas. all of whom are well and favorably j
known by breeders and racers of the long I
tails.
Miss Grizzle was the winner of the Ex
tra stake, the final rounds of which were

With His Bride.

HEBE ALL SUMMER,
The "Well-Advertised Couple Arrived
on Last Night's Overland and
Registered at the
Palace.
"The line" will soon have J. Waldere

ited this city last summer and Introduced

Dudes.
panied by his wife. Baroness Blanc, whom
he recently married in Chicago. Their ar
rival terminates :v honeymoon tour across
the continent. Waldere's presence will be
considered by many a blessing, for he is
both a good fellow and a good thingâ on
the rialto.
The fashion plate and "Baroness
Blanc," whose name and history are
linked with several sensational divorce
proceedings which set Eastern soclety
gossips a-wagging their tongues on more
than one occasion, will probably remain
in this city throughout the summer
months. Mr! Kirk is quite fond of yacht
ing, and his experiences on the bay, par
ticularly at Sausalito last year, will al
ways be fresh in his memory. The King
of the Dudes fell an easy victim to the
pranks of several local club men while
taking a cruise on the bay and the story
is quite too good to be left untold.
J Waldere was invited to attend a
yachting party given by several promi
nent society gentlemen and he immedi
ate ly paid a visit to a Montgomery street
furnisher, where he spent a small part Â«)f
his salary for a swell yachting suit. Wal
dere had everything else in the dress
line in his wardrobe, but he unfortunately
had neglected to bring along his Coney
Island out lit.
Mr. Kirk's reputation was at stake and
he spared no expense to secure a yacht
ing costume that would stamp him as the
best dressed gentleman in the party. The
King of the Dudes was the first to the
wire. In Patsy Carroll's vernacular, Mr.
Kirk was certainly the goods. He pro
duced his precious self aboard the yacht,
looking like a rainbow tinted nightmare,
but before the day's cruise was over and
the party broke up Mr. Kirk resembled
a tinted wall more than he did anything
else. During the early hours of the cruise
wine llowed copiously and everybody was
happy. After dinner more wine flowed
ana everybody began to tread the gold
lined borders of that blissful state where
everybody grosvs garrulously confidential
and justly prdfid of his right name.
It was at this ecstatic juncture that the
placid J. Waldere came to grief. Wearied
of the yacht's cargo of pretty girls and
gallant gentlemen, and bowed down by
the weight of his own cargo within, the
fashion plate sank into a blissful sleep
on the stern of the yacht. The company
was shocked and the host was sadly dis
appointed.
They all gathered around the prostrate
form "of the king of the dudes, vaguely
surmising the kaleidoscopic visions that
were probably flitting through Waldere's
drowsy brain.
"Such a nice boy, too," said one of the
buds, as she tickled him under the chin
with the point of her parasol.
"Pity he drinks," chimed in another.
"So early in the game, too," chirped a
third, and everybody in the crowd poked
fun at the sleeping swell.
Then somebody in the bunch came to
the cruel conclusion that J. Waldere
looked a bit too ravishing in that Mont
gomery street finery, so they all sallied
down into the galley and ordered the
cook to furnish thorn with large quanti
ties of pot black. To nay that J. Waldere
experienced an inglorious finish would j
be putting it rather mildly. When he |
came out of his trance the yacht was at j
her moorings and the guests had depart
A WOMAN AND AN OPEN GRAVE
ON a mound not a stone's throw from the boathouse at Stow Lake, in
Golden Gate Park, and almost under the shadow of Bible Cross, is a hole,
dug within a few days, of the exact dimensions of a grave. It was dis
covered by Park Policeman Clark, who reported it to Captain Thompson,
and all the attaches and employes of the big resort are speculating on
who the digger may be.
Captain Thompson is inclined to the opinion that it is the work of boys, but
others scout this theory, as the spot is quite secluded and would not be likely
to attract children.
Albert Chaquet, foreman of the laborers employed about the lake, tells of a
recent occurrence that may have some bearing on the mystery. He says that
some days ago a handsome, stylishly dressed woman asked him to show her the
exact spot where some time before he had found the body of a man hanging from
a tree. When they reached the place the woman exclaimed:
"What a beautiful spot to choose in which to die! It Is ideal."
Chaquet asked her if she had known the suicide, to which she replied no,
that she had merely wished to locate the spot. He thought then that she might
be contemplating self-destruction, so he told her that, close watch was always
kept on the spot. The expression on the woman's face made such an impression
on Chaquet that for several days he frequently visited the place, half expecting
to find the woman's body there.
Knowing of Chaquet's strange visitor some of the park employes now con
nect her with the newly found grave. They think she may have dug it herself,
Intending at a favorable opportunity to He down in it and swallow poison. From
its exposed position the strong west winds would Uuickly rill the grave with
sand, and in a few days there would be nothing whatever to Indicate that some
unfortunate had taken this means to shut herself out from the cares and sor
rows of the world.
Whatever may be the explanation of the mysterious grave, the park police
will keep close watch over that vicinity hereafter.
"I don't attach any importance to the matter," said Captain Thompson when
seen yesterday. "I am convinced that it is the work of children. No sane person
would believe otherwise. Several children have been playing up there near the
lake and they have undoubtedly shallowed out the ground there."
ed. J. Waldere was alone with the cook,
and his nice new yachting suit looked like
the rig of a circus clown. It Is needless
to state that it was J. Waldere Kirks
The dude is quite a pleasant chap, and
during his stay here he made Hosts or
friends. .x , . .
The Baroness Blanc is one of the best
known women in America. Her maiden
name was Elizabeth Nicholson, and her
home was in Philadelphia, where her
parents were prominent society people.
The Baroness, before taking her
first matrimonial plunge, was the Pam
pered and petted society belle of Philadel
phia. She first married Alfred Lawrence
Riegle, but forsook him for the stage.
Then she married the Baron Blanc, but
after a time the Baron became jealous of
the attentions which a chap named Fred
Youngling was said to be paying his wife
and he, too, sought relief from his matri
monial obligations. After the divorce was
granted the Baron sued out a writ of pro
hibition, which stopped the Baroness from
making capital of his name in the tre
atrical business.
Evolution and Religion.
Rev. William Rader delivered a sermon
on "Evolution and Religion" last night
before the members of the Third Congre
gational Church. He spoke from the text:
"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and
His righteousness and all these things
shall be added unto" you." In part he
said:
Professor Joseph LÂ« Conte, our eminent
scientist, has given the best definition of
evolution, "a continuous progressive change ac
cording to certain laws and by means of resi
dent forces." By evolution Is meant the way
God does things, and the discovery of this way
Is called science. It Is found that the world
waa not manufactured as men build a house,
but that it grew as a tree grfJws. The stars -
were not made as one turns on the gas, but
gradually according to law and by means of
resident forces. ,
Man has evolved, so has the Bible, which is
only saying that revelation Is progressive.
Society, the church and religion have been
subject to the same law. Because evolution
does not explain the origin but only the pro
cess of life it is as consistent with religion aa
it is with the formation of rock or the growth
of a flower. Evolution has now the honor of
being the last great word in science and re
ligion.

TREADWELL TO
RESUME WORK
ON JUNE 1st
Has No Intention of
Resigning.
HE SCORES JUDGEGROEZINGER
HIS RULING ON THE INGLESIDE
ORDINANCE ABSURD.
Would Like It Understood That He
Was Not Responsible for the
Justice Being on the
Police Bench.
A silly story was published in a mornÂ«
ing paper to the effect that Police Judge
Tread well was to send in his resignation
in a few days to the Board of Supervis
ors, to take effect June 1, and that Prose
cuting Attorney Carpenter had been slat
ed to succeed him.
"The statement in to-day's Chronicle
that I will resign," said Judge Treadwell
yesterday, "is totally unfounded. I have
no intention of resigning my position, and
my physicians assure me that on June 1
I will be perfectly atle to resume my
work on the bench. I walked five miles
to-day, and my ribs, which were injured
in an accident, do not pain me at all now.
It seems that there are certain people
who desire my position before I am dead.
"I wish to embrace this oportunity of
declaring that I greatly deplore the action
of Justice Groezinger in declaring the In
gleside ordinance invalid. He went en
tirely out of his jurisdiction to take upon
himself the function of the Supreme
Court. It is my opinion that his decision,
even if he had any authority to make it,
was a mere quibble. In view of Groez
inger's action it pleases me to say that
the Mayor is the one who appoints those
who take the places of any temporarily
incapacitated official. I am totally inno
cent of Justice Groezinger's appoint
ment."
The only foundation for the story was
the fact that Judges Graham and Mogan
had expressed dissatisfaction at the way
in which Justice of -.he Peace Groezinger
was dispensing justice in Department 4,
particularly in regard to the racetrack
and nickel-in-the-slot machine cases,
which had brought, they thought, dis
credit upon the other courts through at
tacks in the press.
â¢ Judge Treadwell's friends say that he
never had any thought of sending in his
resignation and are amused at the Idea
which is so absurd to those who know the
Judge.
Howard Vernon, the stenographer in
Judge Treadwell's court, saw the Judge
I in Sausalito Saturday afternoon and to
him the Judge dictated the following let
ter, which was sent to the Board of Su
pervisors:
SAN FRANCISCO, May 13, 1899.
To the â¢ Honorable the Board of Supervisors
of the City and County of San FranciscoâGen
tlemen: The condition of the courtroom of
Police Court. Department No. 4, has been the
prime cause of my present sickness. The nau
seating atmosphere and the general condition
of the sewerage and heating pipes and the un
cleanliness of the same are such that it is un
fit for occupancy. My condition being much
improved at the present time. I expect to re
sume my duties shortly, and I most respect
fully request your honorable body that you
provide me with some other suitable quarters
in which to hold court. Very respectfully,
A. B. TREADWELL,
Judge of Police Court. Department No, 4.

when the church was moved to its
nt home on Van Ness and Sacra
mento.
The romantic history of his charge w; s
]t. Mackenzie's inspiration for his Ec-r
--inon of yesterday morning. He turned to j
Genesis for his text and read from the
er which tells ol the pilgrimage of
ham and Sarah into the land of
in, where he builded his first altar.
"It is with special design 1 turn to Gene-
I be. "Genesis is the book
iieginning. Abraham was the lirst pio
neer and his altar the first in the west.
]t is with beginnings and pioneers and al
in the west that we have to do on
flay of jubilee.
"Abraham is not without his successors;
his Bu weft- not lacking in the
surging multitude that thronged here In |
The tent and the altar then were the i
liret care of many and especially of the
founders of this church. They first pitched
a tent for some Sarah and her children,
and then they pitched a tent for God and
the altar for his worship.
"No mansions of marble, no cathedrals
of stone, yet to be raised on these ave
nues can stand for more than those two
weather-stained tenta where our pioneer
sheltered his Sarah and worshiped his
God. The flrst of these as an organized
church was a tent bearing the legend,
'First Presbyterian Church.' "
<< '.'irrying out his parallel. Dr. Macken
zie led his congregation on from the time
of the pitching of the tent on through the
days when the word became dominant
and the tents gave way to the more sub
stantial altor9 of the present day. He
was filled with his theme and spoke with
a feeling that held his hearers as wrapt
as himself until he had finished.
In the evening he allowed those who had
come in to congratulate and give assur
ances of good will to do the talking.
Mayor Phelan, though not of the Protest
ant" faith, occupied a prominent seat, and
when Introduced by Dr. Mackenzie paid
a glowing tribute to the church, its his
tory and the good It has done, and ended
with a well deserved eulogy of its pas
tor.
William Pierson, for years a pillar of
the church, followed him with some rem
iniscences of those who had gone and of
the early life of the church itself, and ho
In turn was followed by George D. Gray
of Oakland, and Gates D. Fahnestock,
who spoke along similar lines. The mv-
Fie and the decorations were in keeping
â¢with the spirit of the day, and the choir
never sang in better voice.
LEAGUE OF THE CROSS.

The League of the Cross Cadets had a
practice drill in Mechanics' Pavilion
yesterday afternoon that lasted for near

CHILDREN RALLY IN THE
CAUSE OF TEMPERANCE
INTERESTING MEETING AT MET
ROPOLITAN TEMPLE.
Mrs. Stevens and Miss Gordon Are
Given a Warm Welcome by the
Little Crusaders.
Nearly 500 children rallied In Metropol
itan Temple yesterday afternoon to wel
come Mrs. Lillien M. N. Stevens, presi
dent of the National Woman's Christian
Temperance Union, and Miss Anna A.
Gordon, the vice-president-at-large, and
to further attest their willingness to con
tinue to aid the leaders in their grand
undertaking.
]n the gallery the parents and others
interested in the organization were in
terested spectators. The distinguished
visitors sat on the platform surrounded
by the leading members of the W. C. T.
U. The stage was prettily decorated with
(lowers and a large picture of the late
Miss Francis Willard, who so ably watch
ed over the society. In the back
ground were the silken banners of the
various legions represented in the body
of the hall.
The meeting opened with the entire au
dience singing Miss Gordon's song, "On
ward We Are Marching, Alcohol to
Fight." This was followed by a prayer
by the Rev. Mr. Vinton of lowa. Mrs.
M. L. Gray, county president of the W.
C. T. U., then stated the object of the
rally and introduced Mrs. E. L. Mc-
Cracken, superintendent of the local
work. After complimenting the little
ones on their fine showing the latter call
ed for a salute to the Hag. .Little Mabel
McNorton held the silken flag while the
children pledged their allegiance to it.
This was followed by the singing of the
national hymn by the entire audience,
led by Mrs. B. Mills.
The "Ethel Margaret Gllley" branch
then arose and saluted the leaders by re
citing "I pledge my head, my heart and
this right hand for God, and home and
native land." Another branch sent a
bunch of white roses to Miss Gordon and
gave her a "Ciiautauqua " salute.
Miss Gordon then addressed the gath
ering and soon won the hearts of every
one by her kindly speech. She had her
little auditors reciting appropriate selec
tions from the Bible after her, responding
to her inquiries and crying at the pathetic
little stories she told to illustrate her
meaning. . â..,, Â
After singing Miss Francis E. \\ lllards
famous song "Saloons Must Go, the
chairman Introduced Mrs. Stevens who
gave a short talk along the lines of tem
perance. Her words of advice were at
tentively listened to by the children and
their elders. She concluded her short ad
d-ess by blessing the former for their
good work and the latter for their sup
port. The meeting closed with the sing
ing of the temperance doxology.
MRS. STEVENS ON TEMPERANCE.
She Tells of the Rise. Progress and
Hope of the W. C. T. U.
Mrs. Stevens occupied the pulpit in the
First Congregational Church last even
ing and delivered an interesting discourse
on the "Rise, Progress and Hope of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union."
"The great temperance crusade inaug
urated twenty-five years ago," said Mrs.
Stevens, "was crystallized into the Wom
an's Christian Temperance Union, the
largest organization of its kind in the
world. By the great work to which the
revered Frances Willard gave her precious
life there has been established fifty de
partments, all of which are accomplishing
extraordinary results. Next to the evange
listic phase of the Woman s Christian
Temperance Union, the educational fea
ture is considered the most important.
The right training of children is a subject
which comes in for a large share of atten
tion. The Legislatures in all of the
States save three, and in all the Terri
tories, have passed laws requiring that
the pupilÃ be taught the nature and ef
fects of alcohol. As to the reformatory,
phase, we are caring for many men who
; have gone astray, as well as for members
of our own sex. though of these latter
there are comparatively few.
"While we believe the Keeley cure is
doing good, it is our special aim to save
boys and girls from going at all to such
an institution, which is simply a place of
confession.. In prisons we have secured
the appointment of matrons who care for
the unfortunate women who are brought
to the portals of the station house through
the evils of drink. As to the legal phase,
I can point to the excellent results at
tained in the State of Maine, which be
fore the prohibition law was passed was
a miserable place to live in, but since
then has grown into the noble, beautiful
State that she now is.
"The forces of righteousness are gath
ering, and I believe that God himself is
going to settle the liquor problem. There
is a great temperance monument now be
ing erected that will reach toward heaven.
The Woman's Christian Temperance
Union is working steadfastly- and faith
fully to place a capstone on Its top, and
that capstone Is to prohibit the manu
facture and sale of strong liquor through
out the world."

THE "TWO-THIRDS OF A MAN."
Metropolitan Temple Overflow Is
Checked by the Police De
partment.
At half-past 7 o'clock yesterday even
ing every seat in the body and In the
galleries of the Metropolitan Temple was
occupied and In five minutes thereafter
the services of Sergeant Coogan with ca
ncers George Treacy and John Kelly were
called into requisition to keep the anx
ious comers from crowding into the build-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 15, 1899.
Ing. Even with this obstacle thrown in
their way several of the better informed
ones, knowing that there is a side en
trance on Jessie street, rushed into the
building through this passage. The jam
became so great thit Sergeant Coogan :
had to get out and lind more of his offl- j
cers to blockade this passage. From the
hour above mentioned until 8 o'clock fully j
20<x> persons were refused admittance by
the police.
The subject on which Dr. Locke dis
coursed on this his second Sunday in the '
Temple was on the "Two-thirds of a ;
Man." He said:
There has always been a vociferous demand
for men. Men of three-thirds are needed; men :
with strong, healthful bodies; with robust, tena
cious intellects, and with their spiritual natures |
sensitive to the call of God and able to divine
the purposes of their creator in their gener
ation.
As the beauty and durability of a nation's
architecture depends upon the quality of its
building material, bo the achievements of an
9ge depend upon the type of manhood. The prox
imity of the PentelUan quarries and the ex- j
quislte texture of the marble made It p'jsnihle to |
place the matchless Parthenon, like a glisten
ing crown, on the Acropolis of ancient Athens.
It Is therefore a nation's duty to itself, and
an obligation it owes to the Individual, to maka
conditions most favorable for the development
and defense of true character. My shibboleth,
to-night Is, 'Give the man a chance." There j
Is many a shapeless, rejected block of human- j
ity which under better conditions can be trans- |
formed into a majestic masterpiece. Angelo's !
statue of David In Florence was carved from
a piece of marble, thrown aside as worthless.
Give the poor as well as the rich a chance; |
the servant as well as the master; the man of
muscle as well as the man of mind. Most men
are not responsible for the environment which
surrounds them. It should be the supreme effort :
of society and church and government to cor
rect whatever may be the false and hindering
conditions which surround the individual citi
zen. If the Individual must lose himself In the
Buunea which surge and moan around him then '
civilization must fail. Kach person Is a cos- \
mos and his orbit must be respected.
c :\c the weak man a chance. Those who are
â trong ought to bear the infirmities of those
who are weak. As this principle of Christ,
which is a fundamental doctrine of social!
, is regarded, tlu> solidarity of society ,
becomes more secure. Because the vicious prey
Upon the innocent and the strong victimize
the weak laws against vice have to be passed
and enforced. When all men gallantly defend
their weaker brothers then all legislation for
the prev< ntli n of crime will cease.
We i ughl to stand by efforts now being made
to suppress gambling in our city, because gam- j
bling Is another Illustration of the strong de- ,
vourtng the weak. It has been shown that
men go fn-m house to house begging cast-off
garments that they may pawn them for money
with which to satisfy their feverish d
to play at games of chance. It is said that
in certain gambling houses in this city men
take the very coats off their backs and bor- !
row money on them from the demons who
operate the gaming tables In the vain Dope
nf retrieving their lost fortunes. The time
Will come in this city when, if the custodians
of the peace and the Judges who administer
the law do not close these gates of hell which
are plainly against tho law and protect the i
weak and tempted and helpless men, I say
thÂ« time will come When outraged public 6en
timont will arise en manse and drive these
agencies of the devil out of the precincts of
uur beautiful city.
we a great and sacred duty to the fallen
men and women who are about us. Most of j
these poor creatures are where they are be
cause of the failure of the authorities to en- j
force the laws against vice. We must give j
them a chance, first, by removing the surg
ing evilfi which engulf them; and second, by
attracting them away from vice by love and ,
sympathy.
We must give the black man a chance as \
well as the white man. It is to be regretted i
that after all these years of freedom it is j
nprr-ssary to raise a voice of protest against
any racial prejudice which hinders the prog
reas "f any of our fellow-citizens. One cannot I
read the horrifying details of the recent lynch- :
Ing ol two negPOM in the South without the j
deepest shame and humiliation. What a spec- ;
tacle to have been enacted in a nation which
boapts of Its advanced civilization. I have no |
defense for the deedfl of the dastardly vil
lains who commit crimes for which the pro
cesses of the law will speedily punish them. I
Rut what of the old preachT who, on the tes- j
tlmony of a confessed murderer, 1b seized by
an lnfuria<ed mob and not only hurried to
death, but mutilated as If in the hands of
savage cannibals. I recognize any act of no
ble chivalry which In ordinary emergencies
goes beyond the law and visits penalty upon
the offender, but there can be no logical rela
tion between such chivalry and the blood
curdling atrocities of lynch law. With South
ern blood flowing In my own veins and with j
ties of kinship which bind me with deep af
fection to a people who are not surpassed in all ;
the exquisite adornments of true character, I j
enter my most earnest and vehement protest I
against such crimes against good government
and against a race which Is In this nation be
cause of the white man and which has dem
onstrated Its fitness to remain among us and
become permanent factors In thrift, loyalty
and manhood.
THEY WILL ASK AID
FROM THE PASTORS
WORK OF VIGILANCE COMMIT
TEE AGAINST CHINATOWN.
It Is Hoped the Slave Traffic Will Be
Denounced From Every Pulpit
in the State.
The fight against the slave evil of
Chinatown will be brought to the notice
of the ministers of the city and State
to-day by a circular letter addressed by
the vigilant committee. In this letter
the earnest co-operation of the ministers
is asked for, and enclosed is the pream
ble of the committee explaining the work
it has set out for itself and the ends
it hopes to accomplish. The communica
tion is as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, May 13, 1889.
RevÂ«rend Sir: We wish to call your atten
tion to the enclosed preamble, which fully seta
forth the Intention of our society, and to ac
complish which we will call upon all the
pastors in the city and county of San Francisco
and the State of California to unite with us
. and aid us by your hearty co-operation. We
have taken great pleasure in placing your name
on our list of honorary members, trusting that
you will accept and act in unison with us. We
realize that In this matter we will need not
only workers but the united and unbroken
moral support of all Christian people in this
city and State. We hope you will make this a
special object of prayer and that you will from
time to time bring Its needs before your con
gregation, urging upon them the importance of
making this a personal matter, as the future
welfare of our city and State rests in their
hands. With this combined effort we feel as
sured that failure will bÂ« impossible and that
Chinese slavery and the Importation ( f women
and children for Immoral purposes will cease
and that law and order will be enforced.
The work of sending away these ad
dresses will be performed to-day, and
before the end of the week it Is hoped
that something will be said of the ques
tion of slavery from every pulpit In the
State.
INDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS.

WILMERDING
PREPARES TO

Temporary Structure
Being Put Up.
i
TO CO-OPERATE WITH LICK
BEGULATIONS CONCERNING AD
MISSION OF PUPILS.
Fundamental Principles Will Not
Suffer at the Expense of Me-'
chanical Training and
< Education.
Â»
On the second day of October the WII
-merdlng School of Industrial Arts, un
der the administration of the Regents of
the University of California, will be ready
to receive pupils.
The school will occupy a block of land,
200 by 400 feet, at the corner of Sixteenth
and Utah streets, directly opposite the
California School of Mechanical Arts, and
it is intended to have the two institutions
supplement each other and co-operate as
far as possible.' An exchange of classes
between the two institutions may also
prove feasible.
The building, a new two-story brick
structure, 60 by 160 feet, will be substan
tial and convenient, although but tempo
rary in design. It is the intention of the
management to have the students of the
school, in the near future, plan, erect,
finish and fully equip a permanent build
ing of brick and stoneâ model of archi
tectural design, usefulness and conven
ience.
The number of weeks. the school will be
open in a year and the length of a term
have not been decided upon.
The curriculum of the "Wilmerding
School includes a long list of building
tradesâ carpentry, cabinet work, brick
laying, plastering, plumbing, stonecut
ting and architectural drawing, a distinct
benefit to the Lick School, which hereto
fore has been compelled to extend its ef
forts over a very wide field of instruction
in order to meet the average needs of a
large clientage, drawn from nearly every
county of the State and representing all
classes of the community. It will be the
policy of the Lick School to expand along
the line of the machine pattern
making, model-making, forgework, mold-
Ing, machine shop practice, electrical
construction, etc., leaving the field of the
building trades to the Wilmarding School.
The school will be free of charge for tui
tion, and will be open to any boy or girl
of this State who has completed the
eighth grade of the grammar schools,
upon the following conditions:
Applicants will be admitted upon satis
factory recommendation from their for
mer teachers, principals, or school super
intendent. Up to June 1 of each year
places are reserved for qualified appli
cants. Applications received after June
1 are not acted upon until July 15, and if
the number of such applications exceeds
the number of places remaining, then
competitive examinations will be held for
those whose, applications were filed later
than June 1. This examination will be
written, and the applicant's qualifications
will be judged by his ability to express
himself clearly and correctly by means of
simple English sentences; by his knowl
edge of the processes of arithmetic, and
by his acquaintance with the leading
facts of United States history and de
scriptive geography. . . ..
The number admitted at the beginning
of the next school year, July 31, ISO!*, will
be limited to 75 boys and 30 girls.
Applicants admitted to the school will
be assigned work on the day of their ad
mission in all departments in the five
months' manual training or preliminary
course which all students must take as a
needful preparation for the work In their
chosen trade. ,
A large part of the day will be given to
shop work and the essentials of a purely
mechanical education, not neglecting,
however, the general training In English,
history, geography, arithmetic, geometry,
physics, art, and other fundamentals that
are important in the education of a first
class mechanic.
A tried and thorough system will be fol
lowed in all departments based on peda
gogical and mechanical principles.
It will take three years to complete a
course which will be pursued in learning
any one of the trades.
The school will not attempt any more
theoretical instruction than is necessary
and practical for the carrying out of the
idea of a first-class trade school.
SLASHED WITH A PENKNIFE.
A Soldier and Two Citizens Have a
Fight in Front of the City Hall.
Jack King, who is employed in Lei
bold's harness store on Larkin street op
posite the City Hall, -was under the in
fluence of liquor in front of the store
yesterday afternoon. His wife was en
deavoring to get him home and he used
strong language toward her that at
tracted the attention of two soldiers who
ware passing. They stood looking on,
when Harry Newton, alias Harry W.
Williams, went up to them and ordered
them in an insolent manner to move on.
The soldiers claimed they had a right
to stand on the sidewalk, and just then
King struck one of themâ William Stev
ens of the Fourth Cavalryâ and ran
away. Newton took up King's fight, and
as he squared off Stevens pulled a pen
knife out of his pocket and slashed him
on the right wrist. Stevens was arrested
by Policeman M. Murphy and booked at
the City Prison on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon, anil King was ar
rested by Policeman McMurray and
booked as a drunk. Newton had his
wounded wrist dressed at the Receiving
Hospital. He gave two addresses, one at
1609 Larkin street and the other at 1622
Larkin street.

KELLOGG ON SYMPATHY.
Baccalaureate Sermon Before the Uni
versity of California Graduates
by Their President.
BERKELEY. May 14.â President Mar-
tin Kellogg of the University of Cali
fornia delivered the annual baccalaureate
sermon this afternoon to the mem
bers of the graduating class. The occa
sion was memorable as being the last,
probably, on which the venerable head of
the faculty will speak to the students in
his official capacity.
The sermon was given in the audi
torium of the First Congregational
Church, on Dana street, 'iho graduates,
with their friends, completely filled the
building. Appropriate music was ren
dered by the church choir.
President Kellogg had chosen for his
subject "The Sympathetic Life." His ad
dreas was an appeal to the college bred
man and woman to keep constantly in
touch with their fellow-beings, and "with
all the means of higher culture. He ar
gued at length for an attitude toward
based upon sympathy, with a con
stant endeavor to exact the good, tne
beautiful and the true. True sympathy
with these three ideals and with hu
manity, he concluded, meant untlmately
a true sympathy with man's creator.
ARIEL OARSMEN
OPEN THE SEASON
WILSON BROTHERS' CREW WON
THE BARGE RACK
Two weeks ago the Ariel Rowing Club
proposed to hold the opening regatta of
the season at Long Bridge, and prepared
a programme of nine events. But on the
appointed day a drenching rainstorm came
on, and later an earthquake struck the
boathouse and shook it to its very foun
dations. Yesterday there was no rain, but
a violent northeasterly wind and rough
water caused the programme to 1"
rloualy curtailed. The shell and outrigged
skiff races were declared off, though W.
Growney and W. McCausland gave a
short exhibition in skiffs. In the senior
versus intermediate barge race the "Wil
son crew, rowing well within themselves,
and in much better form than their oppo
nents, won by about two lengths. The
winning crew was made up as follows:
Wilson, bow; C. Wilson, Xo. 2; E.
Wilson, No. 3; James Wilson, stroke, and
Roy West, cockswain. The intermediate
crew consisted of E. MeDonough,
bow; A. Haughton, No. 2: Frank Lott,
N.>. 3; EL Lynch, stroke, and Harry Smith.
cockswain.
The only other event that was pulled off
was the race between the "Irish" ami
"German" barge crews, the former boat
carrying a green ti;iic and the latter a tri
colored one in her bows. But, though the
"Irish" crew was composed of Hiber
nians, the "German" crew was by no
means exclusively made up of Teutons.
The course was from a starting point near
the Ariel boathouse to a schooner, round
it and back to the starting point. The
tide and wind set strongly toward the
mark, which was easily reached, but in
the windward work to the goal both
barges became half full of water. The
"Irish" crew, however, won easily from
the Teutonico-Hibornian nggrtgation.
1 The afternoon was whi!e<i away by songs,
! recitations and seeches in the boathouse,
: where refreshments were served. The
jinks were in charge of E. Lynch. H. A.
Pleas, A. Taylor, G. T. McGinness, W.
Howe and J. R. Bookman. The officials
of the regatta were as follows: J. I. No
lan, marshal of course; D. J. Sheehan,
referee; P. J. Enright. starter; H. Pleas,
J. It. Cockman and J. Hardie. judges, and
Walter Blake, timekeeper. The Dolphins
were represented by A. P. Rothkopf and
George Baker and several Pioneers were
on hand.
The regatta committee of the Pacific
Association has received an offer from the
California Northwestern Railway for a
regatta at El Campo, and will m^t next
lesday evening to consider the pro
posal. If it is accepted the committee will
set a date and proceed to arrange a pro
gramme.
AMATEUR ATHLETES.
i Next Championship Regatta Will Be
Held Over an Accurately Meas
ured Course.
At a meeting of the Pacific Association
of the Amateur Athletic Union, held last
night, the following members of the
board of managers were present: J. R.
Bookman, in the chair; S. J. Pembroke,
C. Dole, H. A. Keelor, W. Espy, George
Jamrs, H. Hauser, A. P. Rothkopf. li.
A. "Widemann and a representative of the
Columbia Boys' Club. President Bock
man read a communication from J. E.
Sullivan, secretary of the A. A. U., -with
regard to the fees to be paid to the Pa
cific Association for sanctions for foot
ball and other sports. The representative
from Stanford University was requested
to use his influence to have the delinquent
fees for football sanctions paid by the
! executive committee of the university.
Secretary Keeler was instructed to write
j to J. D. Mahoney. formerly secretary of
the association, asking him to forward
all records in his possession. Notice was
given of three proposed amendments to
the constitution of the Pacific Association
âfirst, that each club have three (instead
of one. aa at present) representatives on
the board of managers; second, that none
but bona-flde amateurs have seats on the
board; third, that no member of the
board be permitted to bid for medals or
other trophies to be awarded as prizes
by the association. The secretary was
instructed to send notices of the amend
ments to all the members of the board,
the amendment to come up for ac
ceptance or rejection at the next meet
ing of the board.
| An amendment was made that tho
Alameda Boating Club will make an
endeavor to have the next championship
rowing regatta held on Oakland (reek,
where the water Is smooth and the facili-
I ties for viewing the races are much great
i er than at Long Bridge. $. course is to
be surveyed and distances accurately
! measured, so that the times made over
the course may be worthy of record and |
may enable California oarsmen to com- i
pare their performances with those of
men In other parts of the United
States.
The members of the board were ask
!ed to use their best efforts to make
ihe indoor tournament to be held under |
â  the auspices of the P. A. A. on Thursday ;
evening, May 25. in the gymnasium of
the < )lymplc Club, as great a success as
| possible.
Importance of Invisible Things.
Rev. Mardon D. Wilson, pastor of St.
Peter's Episcopal Church, preached a
very interesting sermon on "Reality and
Importance of Invisible Things" last
evening. He touched upon things which
are closest the heart of man, and ex
plained the conscience which should be
exercised In treating them. In part he
said:
One distinguishing mark of a righteously re
ligious man is his attitude toward invisible
things. He discerns them, others do not. The
Bible ix full of illustrations, of which we
mention two. Ellsha saw the countless thou
sands of the armies of the Lord who were his
protection when the King of Syria came to
take him at Dothan. His servant could not
\t the baptism of our Lord by John the
Baptist he heard the voice of his Father speak
ing to him; others round him said it
thundered.
Evidently things Invisible to mortal eyes are
the subject matter of the Christian faith, and
for them the Scripture claims the utmost re
ality, '^d, his providence. Immortality are the
eFÃenco of Christian verity, and St. Paul says,
"We look not on the things which are seen but
on the things which are not seen; for the
thing? which are seen are temporal, and the
things which are not seen are eternal."
Upon what doea this power of Christian

vision rest? Ca) Primarily and mainly upon
the righteousness of the individual, which rests
upon the promise of the Master, "The pure in
heart shall see God."
(b) But it rests also on the analogy of what
we call natural things. Gravity, electricity,
evaporation, other forces and powers of nature,
are quite as Invisible to the human eye as the
unseen things of Christianity. So morally
men's motives are more real than their ac
tions.
This belief In the spiritual vision of invisible
things is no more against the spirit of our age
than against the spirit of the age of Christ:
it is really against the spirit of any age, but
this is only in this case evidence of its truth.
"The voice of the people is not always the
voice of ' God."
80, then, we justify our faith in the invisible
by its results. As the law of gravity made its
place by the problems it solved, so this faith
In the Invisible Is Justified by the clear moral
judgment* of those who s^e because they are
: pure in heart. The Christian then becomes a
city set upon a hill, and by the radiance of his
deeds the world Judges of the truth of the in
| visible things which he believes. This is a re
| sponsibillty which Christians cannot shirk.
TARGETS PUNCTURED BY
BY MANY RIFLEMEN
A DAY'S SHOOTING AT SHELL
MOUND RANGES.
Five shooting organizations gathered at
I the Shell Mound ranges yesterday and a
large number of marksmen kept up a
| ceaseless fusillade at the targets from
' early mor*hing until darkness compelled
them to desist.
The day was far from favorable for
good results. The wind, which blew a per
i feet gale, played sad havoc with the judg

IT WAS A MILKMEN'S PARTY.
A Big Row Over the Rejection of an
Applicant for Union Membership.
The Swiss milkmen, not to be outdone
by the kid-glove aristocracy, had a select
party of their own out on the Mission
road on Saturday night.
The affair was advertised to come off at
the saloon of Joseph Hess and Joseph
Deschuranble, both of whom are expert
milkers, and as a consequence took par
ticular pains to have a select gathering
of their own kind. In this they succeeded
far beyond their expectations, for every
! dairy along the Mission road was deserted
< and ail hands assembled at the place
designated.
Hesa acted as master of ceremonies and
as soon as the floor was properly set his
whistle gave the dancers notice that all
social formalities had b<?en set aside and
each couple, whether paired off by mem
bers of the opposite sex or otherwise, was
given to understand that the affair would
be a go-as-you-please racket.
During the early hours of the morning
and when the musicians had been com
pletely pumped out it was proposed to
hold a meeting of the recently-organized
Milkeis' Union. This motion prevailed
and it would have been better for all
hands if it had been voted down, for it
i brought a whole lot of trouble to all who
participated in its deliberations.
The whole trouble arose over the ad
mission of a can cleaner from Fessler's
dairy. His proposition for membership
was objected to by the drawers of the
lacteal fluid. They could not stomach a
can cleaner as one of their members.
From angry words to blows was the
shortest road to an adjustment of the
trouble. In short, there was a large
sized fight on hand in less' time than It
takes to spell the words. The barroom
that was the pride of the residents of the
, Six-Mile House was in smithereens In a
I few minutes. Then the party adjourned
to the sidewalk and opened a fusillade of
rocks on the windows and side of the
house.
The racket was heard by Sergeant.
Blank, who was on duty on College Hill,
and he at once railed for an auxiliary
force from the Seventeenth Street Sta
tion. Captain Gillin responded and dis
patched Officers Tom O'Connor, E. J.
Thompson, Tom Connell and A. Winslow
with the patrol wagon.
On the arrival of the reserve force at
the scene the sidewalk was dyed a purple
hue, and half a dozen or more of the
late dancers were laid out. Blank, with
the assistance of his force, gathered In
the following and charged them with
drunkenness: Joseph Underalben, Alexan
der Renner, Ben Van Weurgert. Frank
Emhoff, Louis Blattler, Antone Anderag,
C. Gost, Joseph Zehner and John Betchet.
The two proprietors, Joseph Hess and
Joseph Desehuranble, were locked up on
the charge of conducting a disorderly
house. By the time the merrymakers ar
rived at the Seventeeenth Street Station
the clock had pointed to the hour of 6 in
the morning.
AT THE PARK AND BEACH.
High Winds Make Pleasure-Seeking
a Labor of Love.
Notwithstanding the dust and flying
gravel and the harmony-dissipating, bone
chilling wind that blew all yesterday
afternoon, the Park band played on and
did not complete the elaborate programme
until 'nearly 5 o'clock. The small au
| dience was not unduly appreciative, being
I occupied chasing hats and downing skirts
i that wafted heavenward. In consequence
j but little enjoyment was to be found at
the city's rleasure ground.
The drive was small and wheelmen
scarce. No accidents occurred and a
spirit of ennui pervaded the Emergency
Hospital and Police Station. Superin
tendent McLaren reports that the grading
i has been completed on the new lake out
! toward the beach and this week work will
be i-ummcnced on the road running to it
from First avenue. The grading of the
lake was a big undertaking, and the park
officials are pieased at its completion, as
attention can now be turned to other im-
provements.
At the Chutes the usual large crowd
congregated. The programme in tho
theater is of high standard and the house
was packed. The Arizona Snake Charm
ers, The Merry Midget and a performing
bear are the attractions in the Zoo this
week, while a new galloping horse merry
go-round and the tiny passenger train
amuse the crowd outside. Owing to the
high wind Markeberg did not make an as
(â ciisior. yesterday, postponing the event
until next Sunday, at which time the
ascension will be made, the weather per
mitting, 'wi.

both men bclpg roundly applauded at the con-

detectives judge by disappearances.
POINT LOMA CONGRESS
OF THE THEOSOPHISTS
UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD DIS
CUSSES ITS FEATURES.
Dr. Jerome Anderson Tells About the
Project of Establishing a Colony
for Uplifting Humanity.
The regular meeting: of the Universal
Brotherhood, Theosophists of America,
was held last evening: at the Academy of
Sciences building. The meeting partook
of the nature of a symposium and was
devoted strictly to a consideration of the
recent congress of the brotherhood held
at Point Loma, Cal., and of the good re
sults which are to result from the con
vention of men interested in the uplift
ing of humanity.
A large audience gathered to hear Dr.
Jerome A. Anderson, Mrs. H. H. Somers
and Professor Oettl give their individual
impressions of the congress. Professor
Oettl also entertained his hearers with
musical selections which were well re
ceived.
Mrs. Somers stated that the dedication
of the corner stone of the building which
is to be erected by the brotherhood at
Point Loma was symbolical to her of a
rededication of the organization to hu
manity. To her it appeared that a mighty
temple of truth will rise on the site,
which will be a power throughout the
land.
Dr. Anderson devoted himself princi
pally to the colonization project of the
brotherhood which the congress had de
cided to establish at Point Loma.
"All nations," he said, "wfn be repre
sented in the colony, for we believe that
no man should be excepted in the gen
eral endeavor to uplift humanity. Schools
will be established, substantial houses
will be built and in fact everything that
goes to make a perfect colony will be
incorporated in the movement. Some
colonists are even now ready to go into
it, and there will be plenty to take ad
vantage of the inducements offered to de
serving applicants.
"The inspiration that I received from
the congress was that we are going to
accomplish a noble work and one that
cannot fail to have a substantial bearing
on the future state of society. Earnest
and steadfast support, however, is ab
solutely necessary if you would see the
successful fruition of the grand project."
After the speakers had concluded their
addresses a general discussion followed
on the subject in which several present
took part. The usual questions by inquir
ing persons were put and satisfactorily
answered by the members.

"Bunt" Smith, the Bay City man, punc

so much time in the consequent ex
changes that his club was completely out
of It. The finish was therefore left to
E. F. Russ, the Olympic rider, and J. B.
Wing, the Garden City man. They rode
together, exchanging pace, to within
two blocks of the tape on Central avenue,
Alameda, when each bent over his han
dle-bars and the real test began. Slowly
but surely Russ gained inch by inch, and
as they Bashed under the wire he was a
wheel's length and one-fifth of a second
to the good. The Bay Citys finished nine
minutes later and the Acmes eleven min

After Russ had crossed the tape his
club mates, hardly realizing the good for- |
tune that was theirs, hoisted him on their
bhouldera and yelled themselves hoarse
with joy, and none begrudged them the j
sweets of victory. An immense crowd
had gathered at the finish and along the !
avenue hading to it, and many lingered
for an hour after the race was over, lis- !
tening to the stories of the riders and i
talking about the event.
The race was onlirely free from com- !
plaint, the victory fairly won, and no >
ground for complaint or protest was even
suggested.
In the packet carried by the men was a I
letter from Mayor Phelan to the presi- |
dent of the Board of Trustees of Alameda,

Funeral of Jack Lippman, Who Died
at Manila.
Jack H. T>ippman. Troop X', Fourth Cav
alry, was buried yesterday from the res
idence of his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Hy
man I..ippman, 1412 McAllister street, with
military honors. The. remains of the !
young soldier, who died at Manila, were I
brought to this port by the transport
Grant recently. The hearse bearing the
remains of the young soldier left the resi
dence at 10:30 a. m., preceded by a squad
of mounted cavalrymen, while eight dis
mounted men from the same regiment
acted as pall bearers. The escort accom
panied the coffin as far as the Third and
Townsend station, where a special train
conveyed the large funeral party to Hills
of Eternity Cemetery. Rabbi Nieto de
livered an eloquent funeral sermon in the
chapel at the cemetery, praising the sac
rifices made and the accomplishments of
the American soldiers in the Philippines,
especially those who had responded to
the President's call for volunteers to en
gage in the war against Spain, or whom
young L,ippman was one. "These are the
boys," said Dr. Nieto, " whose sacrifices
in the cause of humanity and whose de
votion to their country's flag have made
these United States what they are."
The display of floral tributes was of the
most beautiful and elaborate nature.

WINE MEN ARE
WORRYING ABOUT
THE SITUATION
Future of the Produc
ers' Corporation.
COMPACT MAY BE ABOLISHED
SONOMA COUNTY WINEMAKERS
OPPOSE CONTINUATION.
Directors of the Big Combine Will
Hold a Meeting To-Day to De
termine This Year's
Policy.
The clear-headed wine men of the
State are regarding- with much anxiety
; the present situation of the combination
of wine makers known as the California
; Wine Makers" Corporation, which com
â  prises about 80 per cent of the producers
' of dry wine in California.
There is considerable dissatisfaction
. among many of the members, and unless
1 this discontented element is placated the
continuation of the combination will be
impossible. This fact, and the further fact
: that the co-operation of wine makers has
| been practically the salvation of the in
] dustry in the past two years, are what
I makes wise men look worried when they
see. a prospect of the corporation going to
pieces. Even the merchants who fought
i the producers' combine fast and furious
] for several years now acknowledge that
! the destruction of the combine would re
sult in the return of the old situation
| when wine sold at 5 cents per gallon.
They say there can be no other outcome,
' for the producers will cut each other's
throat in competition, and that the mer
chants will take advantage of the situa
tion and force prices down if they get
the opportunity.
The Santa Clara County wine men ap
pear to appreciate the gravity of the
crisis, and by means of a couple of peti
tion-; signed in thai section have urged
the directors of the corporation to take
active steps u> reorganize f'>r handling
the coming crop, which as yet has not
been contracted for, notwithstanding the
lateness of the season. They ask for a
modification of last year's contract.
On the other band, the big northern
Bectlon of Sonoma County comes forward
with a robust kick. The producers met
the other day and adopted a set "f reso
lutions that plainly show tha.t they will
ii"t be in this years combine. At a large
meeting held in Healdsburg resolutions
were adopted setting forth that the wine
makers of that district would not join
the corporation for the handling of tae
1R99 vintage unless the officers of the cor
poration secured the contracts of itO per
cont or more of the dry wine makers of
the State. The resolution further sug
that the corporation wind up Its af
fairs as soon as may be without loss to
the individual members. There are some
further sharp features of the resolution
which indicate that the Sonoma County
producers have a large hammer out for
the institution.
So far as the proposition of securing 90
per cent of the dry wine makers of the
State in a compart Is concerned, it is
considered Impossible. However, hy rea
son of the attitude of the producers of
these two great districts, the directors of
the California Wine Makers' Â« 'orporation
will hold a special meeting to-day to con
sider what shall be done for the best in
terests of the industry-, as represented by
the corporation.
One of the important subjects that will
call for the consideration of the board is
the resignation of President Henry J.
Crocker, which was handed in a few days
ago, and which rather severely criticizes
the inaction of the officers in not having
secured the needed contracts hefore this
time. MY. Crocker characterizes this kind
of policy as "suicidal. " Mr. Crocker's de
parture* from the helm of the big institu
tion will be embarrassing, as he has done
much to force wines up to the present
living riasis and place the producers on
something of an independent footing â a
place they had not been for many years
before. The result of this meeting, there

DAY OF WORK AND REJOI < NG
A NEEDED IMPROVEMENT MADE
IN A HURRY.
Bullshead Luncheon in Shula's Grove
and a Programme of Song
Round Out the Auspi
cious Day.
"Two-forty on the old plank road" was
nothing to the pace set yesterday by the
dwellers at Larkspur in the construction
of their new plank walk. It had taken
a lot of public spirit and the better part
of a month to get the money together to
purchase the material, but little more
than half a day to make one of the most
noticeable improvements in the pretty
Marln County resort.
"The better the day the better the
deed," thought the citizens of Larkspur,
and so they chose Sunday for the work.
Anton Shula, who puts in the better part
of six days in the week in this city in the
cigar business and the seventh in his
vine-embowered home at the head of
Larkspur canyon, acted as generalissimo
of the. occasion. He was up wjth the
chickens yesterday morning and took per
sonal care to see that every other person
that had promised a hand in the work
had an early call and a good breakfast at
the. Shula table. More than twenty able
bodied residents and campers responded
to the Shula " 'raus mit 'ihm," appearing
in their oldest clothes, carrying saws and
sledges, picks and mattocks for the work
in hand.
At the tap of 7 they set to work, having
been reinforced by that time by a crowd
of small boys who acted as water and
nail carriers. From "Ward street, which
is opposite the depot, to Madrone avenue,
which marks the entrance to the canyon,
the force of citizen laborers strung out
along Magnolia avenue, and the buzz of
tbÂ«e saw and the -rap of the hammer was
heard in the land. Sawdust filled the air,
which stirred early with a lively breeze,
and chips flew in every direction. Men
hurried this way and that with the
planks, and other men grabbed and nailed
them into position.
Never before in all Marin County was
there such a rush of work. Fiends incar
nate were never in such a hurry as the
husky twenty on thnt plank walk They
threw dirt right and loft; they cut and
laid stringers; they swung sledges and
(Jrove nails, and that beautiful board
walk began stretching Its magnificent dis
tance to the camping grounds.
Shula, who had been appointed a depu
ty sheriff for the occasion, was every
where along the line, carrying planks,
sawing some and hammering others His
chief assistants were Charles Dodge his
brother-in-law, and William Martin who
dwells at Inglenook in Larkspur Canavon
when he is not busy in Wells, Fargo &
Co.'s auditing department. The idea of
tli,. plank walk originated with Shula and
in his efforts to raise a popular subscrip
tion to purchase the materials lie found
no readier supporter than Martin, and in
the laying out of it the same hearty co
operation was shown.
So steadily did the volunteers work that
by noon, when the lunch bell rang out
the walk had been almost completed fo
Madrone avenue, 1300 feet from the place
of beginning. Jt was a good morning's
work and the amateur carpenters were
hungry, and although they would not ad
mit it. a little bit tired. They were not
slow to knock off for a bite to eat, but
they -were, not prepared for the feast that
awaited them in the grove. On long ta
bles set around in the shadow of the red
woods a number of the ladies of Larkspur
had set a most attractive luncheon, bulls
head being the chief attraction. In ad
dition, with their own fair hands they
fed the hungry to the number of sixty,
some of the drones having joined trie
busy bees who had been buzzing and
buzz-sawing all morning.
The fair cooks, who acted as hand
maidens to the feasting workers, were:
Mrs. William Martin, Mrs. Samuel Rice
Mrs. T. Howell. Mrs. Mc<iivney. .Mrs.
Patterson and the Misses Nettie and Fan
nie Cobb. Their reward came in the way
the luncheon disappeared and in the
knowledge that the new walk was more
for their sakes than for any others.
After the luncheon half an hour was
taken for play, during which an impromp
tu song programme was r< ndered be
tween cooling drinks. W. Moore sang a
solo, "Because," the Occidental Trio
joining in the chorus. P. J. Eisenmann"s
barytone was heard in "Once in the Pur-
pie Twilight," and Ed Moore sang the
raptime ecstasy "Zizzy Zee Zum Zum."
Back the workers went and farther
stretched the walk, until it passed from
Magnolia Into Madrone avenue, where
Miss Octavla Dupais. in lieu of a golden
; spike, fixed it with a 20-penny nail. About
'â â  this time the lumber save nut and a nalt
i had to be called on the work, but not be
fore the worst of it was over. It had been
the intention to laytheentire 2200 feet sep
arating Ward street from the camping
grounds, 1300 feet to Madrone avenue
j four feet wide, and the remainder up the
canyon two feet wide, the accepted di
mension for the best regulated Lovers'
Lane. The moat of the four-foot walk
was laid, and all the stringers and part of
the planking for the narrow strip. Next
