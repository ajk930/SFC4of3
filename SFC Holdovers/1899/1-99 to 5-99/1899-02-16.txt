MANILA, Feb. 16, 11:45
A. M.â Four companies ,
of the California volun
teers which had been
clearing the country in'
the' vicinity of Pateros, i
ten miles southeast of
Manila, and which had
been recalled, were fol
lowed by the enemy to
day as they retired. .
On reaching San Pedro I
Macate the Americans
made a stand near the
churchyard, and the ;
rebels were driven back. ;
The Californians again
advanced and are now 1
occupying the same
ridge, commanding the
vaHey of the river,
which they held yester
day.
Every one was on the
gui vive last night. Sev
eral shots were fired
from the fleet into the
Paranaque district, and I
searchlights were
sweeping the coast
north and south of the
city.
In a house close to
Colonel Funston's head
quarters, in Binondo
Church, 150 Filipinos
were arrested at a meet
ing. They had no arms,
but had 400 uniforms.
In accordance with the policy
of General Otis not to extend his
lines about Manila any farther at
present, the line front already
being nearly twenty-five miles
long, portions of the California
and Washington regiments, the
Fourth Cavalry, and Lieutenant
Hawthorne's mountain . battery,
which were about to make a,con
certed attack on the insurgents
below Pateros, had been ordered
to withdraw last- night to their
former positions along the river.
A thousand or twelve hundred
insurgents were reported to be
massing in the vicinity, some
' coming from the north. The
rebels had hoisted white flags at
Pateros some days ago, and they
secretly assembled under the
shelter of -these white flags yester
day and fired upon the American
outposts. ,
Colonel James F. Smith, with
Companies L, D and M of the
California'" Volunteers, proceeded
to clean out the enemy along his
front.
The rebels opposed him from
the brush and several skirmishes
occurred, during which six Cali
fornians were wounded before
the rebels were driven out. The
The San Francisco Call.
enemy was driven out of Pateros
and routed in the stand which
he attempted ,to . make south
of â¢ that place. , This movement
was carried out rapidly and vig
orously, a river boat shelling the
'villages .and working . its rapid
fife guns very effectively on the
jungle.. Ten companies of the
California Regiment, four com
panies of the Washington Regi
ment, two , companies of the
Idaho Regiment and a battery of
the Sixth Artillery were en
gaged. The rebels were driven
toward Laguna de Bai.
All is quiet along the rest of
the line, with the exception of an
occasional exchange of shots be
tween sharpshooters breaking
the monotony of the day. ,
Lieutenant Potter of the signal
corps arrived from Iloilo yester
day evening with dispatches from
Brigadier General M. D. Miller
to Major General Otis, . com
manding the United States forces
in the Philippine Islands. On
Sunday afternoon General Miller
ordered a reconnoissance in
force to ascertain the enemy's po
sition. Major Cheatham's bat
talion of the Tennessee Volun
teer Regiment marched beyond
Molo without finding the enemy
and returned to Iloilo. .

' CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 15. â There is more ten
sion and less agitation to-night than at
any other time since the Senatorial
struggle began. In every camp de
velopments are awaited. The diver
sion jof a few votes from the tail
enoers to Bulla did not take place to
day as expected. No resistance what
ever was* made to the motion to ad
journ immediately after the first and
only ballot of to-day's joint session.
- By common consent the supporters of
all the candidates ; readily agreed to
await the outcome of the minority con
ference.
Last week Colonel Burns designate!
Thursday of this week as the day when
all the touts should be gathered on the
scene of action to witness the advance
of [the Burns column. Since then the
event has been postponed until Friday.
--' Stephen M. White, whose term of six
years in the United States Senate ex
pires on the 4th of next month, passed
through Sacramento to-night *, on 3 his
way to Washington. He was invited by
friends to stop over for a day or two,
but he declined the - invitation on the
ground that his presence here might
be construed as an expression of a de
sire for re-election.
Governor Gage and Judge Carpenter
went down to Benicia and there met
Senator White. They returned on the
eastbound overland, : which arrived
here at 10 o'clock to-night. The Sen
ator continued, his Eastern . journey.
General : Barnes left* the Senatorial
arena ' for a flying trip , to Dixon this
afternoon. At that place this evening
he delivered a lecture in favor of terri
torial expansion,' the first of the 'Dixon
High School course. The next lecture
of the course will be given by. Professor
Jordan, who will talk against the ad
ministration's policy of expansion. The
general j returned *â¢ here to-night, arriv
ing on the Oregon express.
Reports received late to-night from
the | various Senatorial camps do not
foreshadow any changes in the ballot
ing to-morrow. The touts keep up a
show of confidence, but have again
postponed the date for Burns' parade of
his reserve forces. Early this evening
Friday of this week was named as the
time for important developments. Late
to-night the prediction was uttered that
Colonel Burns' - commission as United
States Senator would be issued about
Wednesday of next week. On empty
assurances of this flimsy and* shadowy
nature the ! touts are expected *to get
outside and whisper to the members of
the "Legislature that it is all settled.
Hints are thrown out that the Grant
forces are on the verge of dissolution
and cannot hold together for more than
three or four days. The real facts of
the situation are that the Grant men
are more determined than ever before
to stand by the San Diego candidate as
long as Burns is in the field. They
advance the idea now that they are in
a position to render the State of Cali
fornia lasting service by defeating
Burns for the Senatorship. By pursu
ing this course they count on receiving
the eternal gratitude of the people of
this State. v
The railroad organs are now busily
engaged in obtaining expressions from
people throughout the State to the ef
fect that the deadlock ought to be
broken: Everybody is in favor of break
ing the deadlock. : Why 'do not the
railroad journals, that are so free
to give advice to the members of the
Legislature, come out and tell the peo
ple the name of the candidate who is
responsible for the deadlock ? â¢ Burns is
| the only aspirant for the Senatorship
: who has not openly avowed a readiness
! to retire from the field in order that an
acceptable candidate may be elected.-
Grant has distinctly expressed a will
ingness to stand aside provided Burns
would agi*ee to get out of the way.
General Barnes and Senator Bulla have
declared their readiness to yield for the
sake of harmony in the party. Burns
i is the only obstinate man In the lot.
j The party is nothing to him. It can go
: to hades for all he cares. He is here
for a ''vindication" and wants to be
vindicated jby election to the office of
United States Senator. .
Republicans and Democrats alike in
California do earnestly desire that this
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
â 
State shall have a full representation
in Congress when measures vital to the
commonwealth are under consideration,
but their wishes in this regard must
be put aside because Burns desires a
"vindication." Is it not time, then,
that the people of the Stateâ the farm
ers, the merchants, the . workingmen
and all others unite in a demand that
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
abandon the hopeless effort to force an
undesirable man on the Legislature?
Must one man's selfish ambitions stand
i in the way of State representation in
the Senate of the United States?
Every day at Sacramento this ques
tion is seriously asked: "Why do not
the friends of Colonel Burns and the
leading men of the Republican party
go to him and say that the future of
the party and the welfare of the State
demand that he should accept Grant's
proposition and step aside in order
that the State may not be deprived of
the services of a Senator in Congress?"
This much and more has been said
to Burns by men who have the right te
speak to him, but he resents every sug
gestion for his own withdrawal. He
would have the other candidates with
draw or enter into an agreement for a
caucus. Whatever may be said by the
touts concerning the usages and cus
toms of political parties, the caucus
proposition is repugnant to the mem
bers of this Legislature. When the
suspicion. is universal that the proposed
caucus is a trap, sensible and inde
pendent men are to be commended for
avoiding its dangers.
The political managers in the camp of
Dan Burns who have the sense to judge
the situation and the courage to give
expression to their judgment know
that the cause of the colonel is lost,
but they do not insist on his retirement
from the struggle because they know
that the colonel is in the fight for a
"vindication."
The colonel has around him a shabby
lot of advisers. For example, two ex-
Harbor Commissioners, Cole and Chad
bourne, whose records are written in
the pages of the contracts for the con
struction of the San Francisco depot,
are touting for Dan Burns.
Only a short time ago Cole was dis
bursing money in the interest of Grant.
His own testimony ought to exclude
him from any Senatorial camp, but he
is here advocating the election of
Burns. *
The other day a railroad tout made
the I assertion that Burns by snapping
his finger could r take six of the sup
porters of General Barnes and as many
from the camp of Bulla. These insult
ing allusions create a bitter feeling of
hostility toward the "Colonel" and the
Southern Pacific. From the outset
Burns' campaign In Sacramento has
been managed with consummate stu
pidity. With the same influences at
his command as the "organization"
controls Martin Kelly could elect Phil
Crimmins to the Senate.
SUPERIOR JUDGES' SALARIES
MAY YET BE INCREASED
CALI. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 15.â Assemblyman Cami
netti of Amador called up Senate bill 56
in the Assembly this afternoon on a mo
tion to reconsider, of which he gave no
tice yesterday, when the measure failed
of passage. The bill provides for an in
crease of $1000 per annum to the salaries
of the Superior Judges of San Francisco,
Tuolumne and Shasta counties.
â  There was considerable opposition to the
reconsideration, and most of it was voiced
by Belshaw of Contra Costa, who, while
he would favor the increased stipend in
the cases of Tuolumne and Shasta coun
ties, would oppose the San Francisco
clause.
Dibble roasted his fellow members for
what he termed their provincial proclivi
ties and their inclination to kick at any
measure beneficial to San Francisco.
He explained that he wanted the bill
reconsidered* so '-that he could withdraw
the San Francisco amendment, if it could
not pass, and leave Shasta and Tuolumne
to go it alone and unhampered.
The vote was reconsidered and the bill
was passed on the file till to-morrow.
Senate bill 571, a special urgency meas
ure to appropriate $18,000 for the contin
gent expenses of the Senate, was brought
in from the upper house and passed un
der a suspension of the rules.

COMBINE AGAINST BURNS

Supporters of the Other Senatorial Candidates
Hold a Conference.
Twenty-Three Legislators Present and All Agree to the
General Terms of the Planâ Another Meeting
Set for To-Day,
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRAMENTO. Feb. 15.â Twenty-three members of the Legislature who are voting for
Senatorial candidates other than Burns and Grant met in executive conference this afternoon for the purpose of for
mulating some plana whereby they can agree to vote as a unit for some one of the various candidates they represent.
These are Barnes, Bulla. Bard, Felton, Scott and Estee." *.â¢""-''*'"â "
X.. decision was arrived at aside from a general agreement for all parties to the conference to consult with their
candidates, after which they shall confer again to-morrow afternoon and determine upon some definite course of ac
tion. 3*Â°33v--3f -333:- Â° . ' 7%7y
Those present at the conference were Senator* Morehouse. Rowell. Dickinson, Stratton, Taylor, Davis, Currier,
Simpson and Gillette. Assemblymen Lardner, Knights, Muenter. Boynton, Knowland, Valentine. Brown, Belshaw, Cos
per. Miller of Los Angeles. Conrey. Robinson. La Bare* and Mellck. The only absentees were Assemblymen Wade and
Dunlap and five of the supporters of General Barnes. >
The incident of the" conference worthy of particular mention was the position taken by Senator Simpson, who had
been allowed to act as chairman as a matter of courtesy. After all the members present had expressed their views
and it was seen that there was a unanimous feeling of opposition to a general Senatorial caucus. Simpson claimed the
floor and announced he was in favor of a general caucus. He said that on account of the contrary views hold by the
other members present he would resign his position as chairman of the conference. He sought to justify his position
by a speceh in which he went hack to the days" before the civil war and gradually followed his own personal history
up to the present day and ended by declaring that he was the greatest Republican of his size and mental attain
ments in this or any other State. 'â¢ . '
Having listened patiently to the Simpson oratory, which is not always entertaining, the members quietly accepted
his resignation of the position, which he held only by courtesy, and proceeded to fleet Senator Gillette as chairman.
All the parties to the conference except Simpson agreed that "the thirty members now voting for candidates
other than Burns and Grant should stand together and vote for some one of their candidates. The only difference of
opinion was as to the manner of selecting the candidate to be voted for and also how long the conference vote should
be cast for him after he was so selected. A majority believed that first one candidate and -then another should be
given the benefit of the conference vote, the length of time he should be made the recipient of this favor to be deter
mined by a majority vote of the members of the conference. If. after all the minority candidates have been voted for
and no election has resulted, then the conference may select some new candidate nnd cast the conference vote for him.
Each member has some, slight variation of this plan to propose, but the general outline seemed satisfactory to
all, and it only remains for the candidates themselves to be consulted in order that they may- express to their sup
porters their views on the subject. From expressions of opinion obtained to-night, it seems probable that there will be
no decided opposition put forth by the candidates Immediately Interested. : 7'.7'77
No decision will lie arrived at, however, until to-morrow, the time for holding the conference having been fixed
for 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Even then no definite action will be taken', for if a plan of procedure is agreed upon the
balloting necessary to the choice of tbe first candidate to be voted for will not occur until the next day.
KENNEALLY MARS THE
ASSEMBLY PROCEEDINGS
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 15.â Although two resolu
tion were introduced in the Assembly to- j
day to adjourn that body. sine die on the I
4th of March, it is not probable that the j
immense volume of business the Legis
lature has piled up before It will be dis- I
posed of before the middle of the month.
Over half o the bills that have been intro
duced are still in committee and those !
that have been reported back have only 'â 
served to congest the files, upon which
scarcely an impression has been made.
Chairman Valentine of the Ways and
Means Committee -has only just â  begun
work on the general appropriation bill
and that will not be ready for introduc
tion before Tuesday at the earliest. The
session to-night was given over wholly
to the second reading file, and nothing
of even passing interest was accom
plished. The day session, however, was
different. All the proposed tax amend
ments that have been introduced came up
in a bunch and all of them were acted
upon. Assembly constitutional amend
ment 232. a substitute for the measure
introduced by Clark of Santa Clara, to
confirm the rounding of Leland Stanford
University and exempt its properties from
taxation, was passed and Clark's amend
ment withdrawn. .......
La Baree of Trinity gave notice that he
would move to reconsider the vote.
Assembly constitutional amendment No.
7, by Cobb, led to a hot discussion. It
provided as follows: '.'All school houses,
academies, colleges, universities and sem
inaries of learning, with the books and
furniture therein, where the management
thereof ls not for pecuniary profit" and
the grounds attached to said buildings
necessary for their proper occupancy, use'
and enjoyment, and not leased or other
wise used with a view to profit, are ex
empt from ' \alion."
Mr. Cobb .und plenty of champions
for his measure; he also found two oi
three strong opponents. Ex-Speaker I
Wright attacked it with all the vigor of
his English. Johnson poured out his op
position, and Felix* of Monterey spoke at
considerable length In its disfavor. Dib
ble, Wade. Melick, White, Cosper, Brown,
O'Brien and Caminetti all came out
warmly in its favor, and when it came
to a vote it won out, though not by a
large margin.
Senator Davis' Senate bill 36, which pro
vides for the building of a wagon road
from Mono Lake Basin to the Tioga road,
was passed, as was also Morehouse's Sen
ate bill 46, relating to the appointment
of Supreme Court Commissioners and the
appointment by them of a secretary.
Another of Senator Stratton's election
laws. Senate bill 95, relating to conven
tions, was taken up and passed without
debate. * â  ''-;â * â â¢â â¢* _ - -"3iP* si>: .
Assembly bill 48. by Dunlap, relating to
franchises, and Assembly bill .151, by Mc-
Keen, authorizing the organization of
rural cemetery associations, were passed,
and Brown's Assembly bill 465. relating to
the appointment of trustees, went through
the same course. Kenneally's Assembly
bill 54, which provides, that only native
born or naturalized citizens of the State
may be employed upon public works, was
passed after a hard fight, but its success
was not due to the effort of its author.
While the debate was on his bill he left
his seat in the back of the chamber and
took one next Assemblyman Clough of
Plumas, where he sat and roundly and
audibly cursed every one * who voted
against his measure. Judge Clough him
self came in for a flood of billingsgate that
never should have gone unpunished on the
Assembly floor. The hot-headed Ken
neally used his filthy oaths regardless of
the near presence of the wives and
friends of members who were in the
chamber, and only Judge Dibble's prompt
ness prevented him making an outburst
that would have caused the sergeant at
arms to throw him off the floor.
Wade of Napa, who was incensed at
the unwarranted attack made upon Judge
Clough, changed his vote and announced
that to-morrow he would move for a re
consideration. . .
Arnerich's Assembly bill 245. which is
designed to reorganize the State normal
school system, was passed with only nine
dissenting votes. - â¢ ... .
Governor Gage's recent veto messages
were on the special order flies and both
of them â¢ were unanimously sustained.
The first, Arnerich's Assembly bill 160,
making an appropriation of $10,000, was
called for by Dibble, and when the vote
to overrule the veto was ordered, the
minority joined with the majority in vot
ing to sustain. The same action was
taken in the case of Assembly bill 69, by
Belshaw. relating to the powers of guard
ians in partition.
Governor Gages message concerning
tbe claims of the different newspapers
In the State for publishing the consti
tutional amendments proposed at the last
election, was referred to the Committee
on Ways and Means, to- which commit
tee have also been consigned the claims
that have been coming in during the past

. The report of the committee was re
i ferred to the Finance and Claims Com- j
mittee for consideration of the items, and j
to the Committee on Rules for the pur- j
pose of having the rules suspended for its *
passage.
Senator Braunhart's bill providing for a ,
1 tax on collateral inheritances provoked
a momentary stir when it came up for |
: passage. There was a disposition to pass ;
I the third reading file and take' up the |
! urgency file, but Braunhart objected. He ;
! wanted his bill considered and passed,
i particularly, he said, as there was a man
'â â  on the floor working against it. and he
! nodded significantly at Alex Vogelsang,
! who was earnestly talking to two Sena
i tors. "Some one is working against my ,
I bill on the floor of the House in viola- ,
: tion of its rules," he declared, and I
want it stopped or I will ask that the ser :
geant-at-arms be directed to do his duty. !
There was nothing done about it, for the j
bill was taken up, amended and sent bacK
to the printers. ' '
Assemblyman Cobb's bill for the prac
tice of horseshoeing as a fine art and for
i the licensing of blacksmiths was then i
taken up. Smith opposed the bill, and so j
did Sims. , . , TT .
Smith opposed the bill bitterly. He de- j
! clared himself against such legislation. !
1 It established a trust of labor; it was the
granting of special* privileges; it was \
hampering trade and the chances of the
young man; it was a line of legislation
vicious unnecessary, useless and ruinous.
Senator Taylor delivered a lecture on
' the formation of the horse's hoof and how
! nearly every disease of the hoof is caused ,
| by improper shoeing. j
i Tha bill was amended to make it apply ,
'â  to the whole State instead of to counties
! of a certain class and also to require two
years' apprenticeship before eligibility for i
] examination. The question was on the ,
1 amendments, and both were adopted and
j the bill was passed to print. ;
I Senator Bettman introduced a resolution ,
; In which it was resolved to adjourn on
I this' the anniversary of the date of the â¢
blowing up of the Maine, out of respect â¢
i to the memory of those who went down *
i with the battle-ship. The resolution was ;
! adopted, and in pursuance of it when the â 
Senate adjourned it did so in memory j
of the Maine." , - â¢
Assembly bill 607, providing for an ap
propriation of $75,000 for the expenses of

substitute for Senator Morehouse's blood
thirsty bill for the annihilation of news
paper men should be reported back to

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1899.
YOLO WILL NOT GET '
A STRIP OF SOLANO
= CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA- I
MENTO, Feb. 15.â An unfortunate, letter
to the Dixon Tribune was mainly respon- |
sible for the report of the Committee on [
County Government this evening. As
semblyman G. W. Pierce of Yolo wrote
the letter, and the decision was against â¢
moving the county line between Yolo and
Solano counties in order to give Yolo $1,- j
200,000 worth of taxable property, In his
letter to the Tribune, dated some months
ago, Mr. Pierce declared that. . Solano
had done all that was possible for the
people who 'now wish to go over to Yolo
and that Yolo had better hot meddle in
Solano affairs. Now Mr. Pierce is the
champion of the disaffected.
On Tuesday night the rebels were heard
before the committee, and this evening
the Solano people told their story. It
began with the reading of Pierces letter .
by the editor of the Tribune, F. A. Hut
ton. Then the witnesses began to tear to
pieces the petitions _igncd by the dis
affected, and managed to have nearly half
the names stricken from them, the sign
ers not having been found to be on the
assessment roll of Solano County. .
It was further shown that the tax rate
in Yolo is $1 10 on an assessed valuation
of $14,000,000; of Solano $1 50 on a valuation
of $15,000,000. The change of the strip as
sessed, at $1,200,000 would bring Solano up
to nearly $1 60 and Yolo down to $1 30,
and in this the committee saw one of the
[joints of the desire for flight into Yolo.
The report was that the bill providing
for the changing of the boundary line do
not pass. Those who were heard were:
F. A. Hutton; O. C. Schulze, manager for
Eppinger & Co., the grain men; E. E.
Long, County Assessor; T. B. Bucking
ham, Supervisor of the revolting district,
and Dr. Baker, the oldest inhabitant.
The case for Solano County was ably
handled by Hon. Alden Anderson. Speaker
of the Assembly and the representative of
Solano County In the House. He took en
tire charge of the matter, collected the
evidence, compiled the statistics and ex
amined the witnesses, and to him is due
the unanimous vote of the joint com
mittee in favor of his county.
TO GOVERN THE LICENSING
OF MEDICAL GRADUATES
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
' MENTO, Feb. 15.â Senator Rowell has a
I bill almost ready for introduction which
j will upset a great deal of the law relat
; ing to the medical profession that is now

i of a board of examining physicians, nine
j in number, Aye of whom shall be appoint
] ed by the regular State Medical Society,
j two by the State "Homeopathic Society
j and two by the State Eclectic Society.
The idea is that all candidates for license
I to practice medicine shall be examined
; before this board in the general branches
of medicine, but when the examination
: progresses as far as materia medica, ther
apeutics and the theory and practice of
medicine, then the candidate shall be cx
i amined by those members of the board of
. medical faith which he has decided to
practice in. "
The board will examine all graduates
i from a legally chartered medical school
J or institution and upon satisfactory evi
dence of their fitness to practice it shall
! issue a certificate to them. This certifi
! cate must be recorded with the County
i Clerk of each county and it must be re
i corded again in the clerk's office of any
i county which he may move into. . The
; bill also provides that physicians coming
i from other States must* appear before
: the board in the regular manner and re-
I ceive a certificate allowing them to prac

I newly graduated. ... .
The bill further provides that the board
I may at any time revoke or refuse to grant

BURNS' CAUCUS SCHEME
RECEIVES ITS QUIETUS
Forty Republican Legislators Have
Openly Declared Their Unal=
terable Opposition to It.
Â¥ ...
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Feb. 15.â Forty of the eighty-five
Republican members of the Legislature have publicly expressed themselves
as being opposed to a general caucus on the question of the election of a
United States Senator. Many others who are known to be opposed to the,
caucus scheme have declined to express themselves on the ground that by
so doing they might engender opposition to matters of legislation in which
they are partlcuarly Interested.* V 3,. 3 7~ ' â 'â 
With only his immediate following favorable to the caucus scheme Dan
Burns finds himself driven out of his last ditch and forced either to with
draw from the conest or resort to outright bribery, with money furnished
him by the Southern Pacific Company, in order to obtain votes he has been
unable to get by the offer of patronage in the gift of the Governor, intimi
dation or the petty political tricks that he has sought to work out through
the medium of an army of paid touts. v ; *..- ' â '-â .*. '**' 7.
The Southern Pacific Company's threat of political damnation to all who
refuse to go into a caucus has failed of effect and the fact has been demon
strated, temporarily, at least, that a majority of the Republican members of
the Legislature are not owned and controlled by the giant corporation.
Few people aside from those here in Sacramento who were immediately in
terested in the Senatorial contest have more than a partial knowledge of
what a Senatorial caucus would mean to Dan Burns. Assemblyman Henry
C. Dibble, who is Burns' right hand man in the Legislature, is chairman of.
the Republican caucus, and by virtue of his position he would have full
charge of the caucus were It called to decide the Senatorial question. As
chairman he would appoint the tellers, whose duty it is to collect the secret
ballots that are cast for Senator. It Is within the power of these tellers
to substitute ballots" written and prepared in advance for those handed
them by the members. There is no means by which such a substitution
could be detected, because the ballot is a secret one. As an illustration,
let It be presumed that a dozen men cast their votes for a man named
Smith. If. when the ballots were counted, but one vote for Smith was
found In the hat, each one of the men who voted for him would believe he
bad cast the vote, for the reason that he had no means of knowing if any
body else voted for the same man.
But Burns will not get a caucus, in spite of all the pull that has been
brought to bear to bring about that result. His political methods are so well
known thats^he friends of the other candidates are determined he shall not
bo given an opportunity to win the Senatorial seat by such methods as are
most familiar to him. â¢ 7-.7'7y.
The opinions of some of those legislators who have not yet publicly ex
pressed themselves are given herewith:
Assemblyman R. de Lancieâ "l am opposed to a secret caucus. About
a caucus on the open floor I have .not made up my mind. But I do not see
what good such a caucus would do." .

SUFFERING FARMERS ASK
RELIEF FROM TAXATION
TALL HEADQUARTERS, . SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 15.â Assemblyman Burnett
to-day offered In the Assembly. a petition
from the residents of the drought-strick
en district of San Luis Obispo County,
praying that the collection of taxes in the
district be suspended until such time as
there has been a paying crop. The signers
of the petition are the same unfortunate
farmer- to whom aid was lately extended
by the State.. With the money that was
advanced them they were enabled to lay
in food supplies and after the first rains
there was every prosepect that their
troubles were at an end for the time being
at least. Now. however, the winds and
the dry spell have played havoc with their
sprouting grain and the prospect is as
black as it ever was. Another hard sea

THERE WAS NO
SHOOTING IN THE
ZINKAND AFFAIR
A Mountain Made of
a Molehill.
THE PRINCIPALS ARE KNOWN
BOTH LADY AND GENTLEMAN
1 ARE FAMILIAR FIGURES.
A Bald Fake Perpetrated by a News
paper on the Public Shown
Up in Its True "7..
. Light.
The sensational story of a prominent
society woman having been shot in the
Cafe Zinkand as published in a daily
paper for the last two days is without ex
ception the rankest fake ever perpetrated
on the public. The Call is in a position
'to state to its readers this morning that
the episode about which the .newspaper
raised such a sensation was nothing 'more
than a case of a woman not of the four
hundred drinking a little too much
and falling down in the lavatory of the
cafe, inflicting a painful injury on the
side of her head which rendered her un
conscious for some time.
The "prominent society man" who the
newspaper said accompanied the woman
is a well-known character of the tender
loin, likewise a well-known ward poli
tician. The Call discovered the; identity
of the woman yesterday, but as the in
cident in the cafe has absolutely no news
value, inasmuch as the unfortunate lady
who was the object of the newspaper's
sensation is.. as before stated, not a so
ciety lady, her name will be withheld. .
At the time the lady was discovered
lying unconscious in the ladies' lavatory
a reporter was taking refreshments at
the bar. He noticed a commotion and
immediately yellow brain surmised that
one of the four hundred had been the
victim of a shooting" affray. He . tele
phoned his suspicions to the newspaper
office and immediately a horde of report
ers were detailed to ferret out the mys
tery. '
Without investigating the matter, the
paper published a scandalous fake on the
word of its reporter, ; who happened to
stray into Zinkand's.
All day yesterday and the * day before
the. newspaper men hovered about Zink
and's, offering large sums of money to
waiters and others employed at the cafe
to disclose the woman's identity.
The morning paper that, published the
story has been trying to get a real, good
sensation for some time, and failing in its
frantic efforts, decided that the little af
fair in Zinkand's gave an opportunity to
exercise its well-known tendencies to
publish fakes and falsehoods. 3

GERMANS WHO

Question) or Commercial Relations
Seems to hjave Stirred Up
Bitter Feeling.
BERLIN, Feb. 15.â The question of
| the commercial relations of Germany
with the United States seems not un
likely to lead to a partial ministerial
crisis.
Addressing an Agrarian meeting re
cently, Baron yon Manteuffel, Conser
vative, said: "Had we increased our
navy sooner the United States would
not have dared to use such language
toward Germany."
At the annual congress of the Agra
: rian League this week similar senti
ments were heard. ' One speaker refer
ring to the speech of Herr yon Bulow
in the Reichstag last Saturday, said:
"It Is useless to serve the Americans
with such sugar bread. If we want to
impress them we must show them out
fists. We want deeds from the Gov
ernment, not flne words. A great power
like Germany cannot allow herself to
be made a fool of. as we so far have
done with regard to "America."
After other speeches characterized
by vigor of exaggeration, the Agrarian
League adopted a resolution congratu
lating Itself upon the alleged "return
of the Government to Bismarck's com
mercial policy."
CONVENTION OF
THE SUPERVISORS
Thirty-one Counties Are
Represented.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
I SACRAMENTO, Feb. 15.â State
convention of Supervisors was begun
to-day. William Curtis, chairman of
the Sacramento County hoard, was
chosen to preside, and W. B. Hamil
ton, clerk of the same board, was
elected secretary. Thirty-one counties
, were represented, the delegates num
i bering about 100. ' Various committees
j were appointed. ;;3; -
The first paper presented was by A.
E. Davis of Los Angeles. It was on the
subject "Roads, Their Construction and
Treatment." The discussion that fol
lowed developed the fact that most of
the Supervisors had come loaded with
! bricks to throw at any laws calculated
to curtail the privileges heretofore en
joyed by Supervisors in the handling
of county road moneys. Even the State
Highway Commission is not in favor
with them because of its proposed State
legislation.
1 D. Horn of Siskiyou, J. H. West of
San Bernardino, P. Tormey of Contra
Costa, T. D. Wells of Alameda, L. D. :
Adams of Placer, S. F. Ayer of Santa j
Clara and Charles Roeth of,' Alameda
all spoke against the bill. * v : 1
Wells said the State should^ have
given the counties, for road . purposes
thousands of dollars it expended in the
salaries and. expenses of the Commis
sioners of the Department of High
ways. He said ex-Assemblyman Clark
of Alameda introduced an obnoxious j
road bill in the Legislature two years j
ago and as a result killed himself po
litically. 3f* .
Supervisor Roeth asked If any Su
pervisor was present who favored the
bill. Not one responded.
At the afternoon session the Commit
tee on Roads and Highways reported
recommending favorably an amend
ment to section 2643 of the road laws:
also recommending the repeal of all
other road laws, and the repeal of the
act creating the Department of High
ways. It was recommended that the
Legislature be asked to provide that
the moneys derived from the collection
of licenses be paid into the general road
fund. The committee's report was re
ferred back to the committee to make
such changes as "it deemed best.
A paper by John Roll oh "Bicycle
Paths" was read and discussed and
various members told what had "been
done in their counties.
The matter of an amendment to the
law that provides that boards must an
nually fix the rate for county advertis
ing was referred to the Legislative
committee. "City and County Districts;
the Mutual Relations of Inhabitants;
Value of Good Roads to Each," and
"County Hospitals, Their Use and
Abuse," will be the subjects of discus
sion to-morrow.

The newspapers, including the offi

ing of the ministerial dissensions. It
is asserted that the Agrarian utter
ances of Baron yon Hammersteln-Lex
ten. Minister of Agriculture, have so
disturbed diplomatic negotiations that
whole sentences of his speeches have

correct possible mistakes. For instance*,
on January 30. he violently attacked

several policemen mounted the stage. At
the time the police interfered Maher had
Conroy in the latter's corner and was
hitting him with both hands. Conroy
tried -to run away and held his hands to
his face. He was apparently helpless.
Conroy was in good condition at the
close of the fight. There was no blood
spilled. The bout was for ten rounds for
$1200, the loser to take $400. Maher rushed
Conrov in the first and the Troy man
showed to poor advantage. He improved
in the following rounds and landed sev

in the only uppercut of the fight. In the
fifth round Conroy was knocked down,
but was up quickly. He showed little

CEBU OCCUPIED
BY THIS TIME
NEW YORK, Feb. 15.â A Tribune
special : from Washington says: The
authorities at the "War Department ex
pect dispatches from General Otis by
the end of this week announcing the
occupation by an American force of
Cebu, the third city of importance in
the Philippines. When General Miller
started for Iloilo his instructions were,
after establishing American authority
at that port, to proceed Immediately to
Cebu and occupy that place. For this
purpose the Fifty-first lowa Volunteer
Regiment was sent after him. but on
account of unexpected opposition to the
landing of General Millers troops at
Iloilo, compelling a tedious delay of
the forces on shipboard, the lowa Regi
ment was returned to Manila last week
and the First Tennessee was sent to
take its place for the purpose of gar
risoning Cebu. It appears that that reg
iment was landed with other troops at
Iloilo on Saturday and Sunday, but in
view of the ease wit/i which Iloilo can
be guarded against attack on the part
of the natives it is thought -that by this
time General Miller has found it pos
sible to re-embark . a portion of his
forces to 'carry oat the original pro
gramme of securing Cebu.

To the People of the Philippine Islands:
Instructions of his Excellency the Presi
dent of the United States relative to the
administration of affairs in the Philippine
Islands have been transmitted to me by
direction of the Honorable the Secretary
of War, under date of December 28, is***-*-".
They direct me to publish and proclaim
in the most public manner to the inhabi
tants of these islands that in the war
against Spain the United States forces
came here to destroy the power of that
nation and to give the blessings of peace
and individual freedom to the Philippine
i people; that we are here as friends of the
rilipinos to protect them in their homes,
their employments, their individual and
religious liberty; that all persons who,
either by active aid or honest endeavor,
en-operate with the Government of the
United States to give effect to these bene
ficent purposes will receive the reward of
its support and protection.
The President of the United States has
assumed that the municipal laws of the
country in respect to private rights and
pronerty and the repression of crime are
to be considered as continuing in force.
in so far as they may be applicable to a
free people, and should be administered
by the ordinary tribunals of justice, pre
sided over by representatives of the peo
ple and those in thorough sympathy with
them in their desires for good govern
ment; that the functions and duties con
nected with civil and municipal adminis
tration are to be performed by such offi
cers as wish to accept the assistance of
the United States, chosen in so far as it
may be practicable from the inhabitants
of the islands; that while the manage
ment of public property and rev
enues and the use of all pub
lic means of transportation are to be
conducted under the military authorities
until such authorities can be replaced by
civil administration, all private property,
whether of individuals or corporations,
must be respected and protected. If pri
vate property be taken for military uses
it shall be paid for at a fair valuation, In
cash if possible; and when payment in
cash is not practicable at the time, re
ceipts therefor will be given to be taken
up and liquidated as soon as the cash be
comes available.** The ports of the Philip
pine Islands shall be open to the com
merce of all foreign nations, and goods
and merchandise not prohibited for mili
tary reasons by the military authorities
shall be admitted upon payment of such
duties and charges as shall be in force
at the time of importation.
The President concludes his instructions
in the following language:
Finally, it should be the earnest and para- i
mount aim of the administration to win the
confidence, respect and affection of the in- |
habitants of the Philippines by insuring to
them In every possible way the full measure â 
of Individual rights and liberty which is the I
heritage of a free people, and by proving to j
them that the mission of â¢ the L'nited States is
one of beneficent assimilation which will sub
stitute the mild sway of Justice and right for
arbitrary rule. In the fulfillment of this high
mission, while upholding the temporary ad
ministration of affairs fur the greatest good of
the governed, there will be sedulously main
tained 'he strong arm of authority to repress
disturbance arid to overcome all obstacles to j
the bestowal of the blessings of good . and,
stable . government upon the people of the
-Philippine Islands. .;.7r.-7.
From the tenor and substance of the j
above instructions of the President I am
fully of the opinion that it is the inten- '.
tion of the United States Government,
while directing affairs generally, to ap
point the representative men now form
ing the controlling element of the Fili
pinos to civil positions of trust and re
fcponsibilitv, and It will be my aim to ap
point thereto such Filipinos as may be ac
ceptable to the supreme authorities at
Washington.
It is also my belief that it is the inten
tion of the United states Government to
draw from the Filipino people so much
of the military force of the islands as
possible and consistent with a free and i
w>ll constituted government of the coun- !
try: and it is my desire to inaugurate a
po'licv of that character. I am also con
vinced that it is the intention - of the
United States Government to seek the es
tablishment of a most liberal government |
for the islands, in which the people them
selves shall have as full representation
as the maintenance of order and law will
permit, and which shall be susceptible of
development on lines of increased repre
sentation and the bestowal of increased
powers into a* government as free and
independent as .is enjoyed by the most fa
vored provinces of the world.
I' will he mv constant endeavor to co
operate with- the Filipino people, seeking
the good of the country, and I invite their
full confidence and aid. -.â,,â

MANILA, Jan. 12.â The following
proclamation was posted on the street
corners throughout the city on Satur
day last:
SUPPLEMENT.
El Heraldo de la Revolution.
Official.
Manifesto of the President of the Revo
lutionary Government. _ ? 3 â¢ â¢ Â
To my brothers, the Filipinos, and to all
the Consuls and other foreigners.^
The proclamation of General E. S. Otis,
of the Volunteers of the L nited States,
published yesterday in the paper_ of Ma
nila, obliges me to circulate the present
so that all may know who read and un
derstand this, mv most solemn protest
against what is contained in General Otis
proclamation. It is my duty, before ray
conscience, before God, before my polit
ical engagements with my loved country
and in view of mv relations in particular
with the officials of North America. Gen
eral Otis calls himself in the proclamation
referred to "Military Governor of the
Philippine Islands." and I protest once
and a thousand times and with all the
energy of my soul against such authority.
I solemnly proclaim that I have never
had, neither in Singapore nor in Hong
kong nor here in the Philippines, any
undertaking or agreement, neither by
word nor by writing, to recognize the
soveroigntv of Aemrica in this my loved
country. On the contrary. I say that I
returned to these islands on board an
American warship on the 19th of May of
last year with the decided and manifest
propostion to carry on the war with the
Spaniards, to reconquer our liberty and
our independence. I stated this in my offi
cial proclamation on the 24th of the said
month of May and it was published in a
manifesto to the Philippine people on the
12th of last June, when ln my native town
of Ca-Vite I exhibited for the first time
our holy national banner as a sacred em
blem of that supreme aspiration; and fur
ther, this was confirmed by the American
General, Senor Merritt, the predecessor of
General Otis, in the manifesto which he
directed to the Philippine people days be
fore he intimated to the Spanish General
Jandares that the town of Manila had
capitulated: In which manifesto it was
clearly and definitely stated that the sea
and land forces of the United States had
come here to give us our liberty, over
throwing the bad Spanish Government.
Finally, to state the case once and for
all. nationals and foreigners are wit
nesses that the land and sea forces which
are here of the United States, have recog
nized, even if only If their acts, the Fili
pinos as belligerents, not only as they
have publlclv saluted the Philippine flag
which triumphantly sailed in these seas
before the eves of all foreign nations, rep
resented here by their respective consuls.
In the proclamation of General Otis he
alludes to Instructions written for him by
his Excellency, the President of the
United States, referring to the adminstra
tion of affairs in the Philippine Islands.
I solemnly protest in the name of Goo*,
the root and fountain of all justice, and of
all right, and who has given to mo the
power to direct my dear brothers in the \
difficult work of our regeneration, against |
his intrusion of the Government of the |
United States in the sovereignty of these j
islands. Equally I protest in the name of
all the Philippine people against this in- j
trusion, because when they gave me their
vote of confidence, electing me. though
unworthy, as the President of the nation, |
when they did this they Imposed on me |
the duty to sustain to the death their
liberty and Independence.
Lastly, I protest against this act. so lit
tle expected, of the sovereignty of Amer
ica In these islands, in the name of all
that has passed, of which I have proofs in
mv possession, referring to my relations
with the American authorities, which
prove ln the most unequivocal manner
that the United States did not bring me
from Hongkong to make war against the
Spaniards to benefit the Americans, but
to help us to gain our liberty and inde
pendence, for the attainment of which
object the American authorities promised
me verbally their decided and efficacious
co-operation. And so you must under
stand, my dear brothers, that, united by
bonds which It will be impossible to
break, such is the idea of our liberty and
our absolute independence, which have
been our noble aspirations, all must
work together to arrive at this happy
end, with the force which gives convic
tion, already so generally felt among all
the people, to never turn back in the road
of glory. on which we have already so
far advanced. EMILIO AGUINALDO.
ARMS FOR INSURGENTS
IN HIDING AT HANKOW
. NEW YORK. Feb. 15.â A Hongkong
cable to the.Journal says: Large quan
tities of arms purchased by Aguinaldo
in Japan are now held in hiding at
Hankow. The insurgent agents are
waiting for an opportunity to ship them
to the Philippines.
United States Consul General Wild
man has a close watch kept on the
Filipinos and the shipping at Hankow
to prevent the arms being smuggled
out. Unless Aguinaldo secures those
guns and ammunition, prolonged resist
ance on the part of the Filipinos will
be impossible.

THE SAN "â ' FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1899.
REORGANIZATION
BILL MUST PASS
Otherwise Extra Session
Is Inevitable.
NO MAKESHIFT COMPROMISE
PERMANENT INCREASE IN REG
ULAR ARMY DEMANDED.
As to the McEnery Resolution There
Seems Little Chance for Its
Passage in the
House.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 15.
There is an impression at the Capitol
that the administration is bluffing in
threatening to call an extra session if
some kind of an army reorganization
bill is not passed at the present session.
At the last moment, it is claimed, the
administration will back down and ac
cept a makeshift compromise. This is
emphatically denied, however, by those
who are close to the President. Mr.
McKinley is more determined than ever,
they say, to accept no temporary make
shift as a substitute for the army bill,
and will surely call an extra session if
a bill is not passed at, the present ses
sion providing for a permanent in
crease in the regular army. It is ab
solutely necessary, it is said, in his j
judgment, to enable the Government to j
meet the new conditions that con- |
front it.
Apparently there is no weakening on j
the part of Cockrell and Jones and j
other Democratic Senators who are an- j
tagonizing the reorganization measure; j
hence an extra session may be regarded j
as almost inevitable.
Speaker Reed, it is understood, is not ]
likely to interpose any obstacles to the I
taking of a vote on the McEnery resolu- j
tion in the House. In fact, if the !
Speaker does anything regarding the j
resolution it will be to help it along, j
However, for the present, the fate of ]
the McEnery resolution in the House j
rests with Chairman Hitt of the For- |
eign Affairs Committee. Hitt is a |
strong administration man, and he will
probably be governed to a great extent
by the wishes of the President in the
matter.
So far as is known Mr. McKinley has
not expressed any opinion regarding the j
McEnery resolution. It has been the j
desire of the administration, however, j
to be left free to act as it sees fit and j
not to be hampered by the passage of j
any resolution declaring a future policy I
of the country toward our recent ac
quired possessions. The McEnery reso
lution is probably as harmless as any I
resolution on that subject could be, but j
it is believed the President would pre
fer not to have it passed at this time, j
If this should prove to be true it is j
more than likely that Hitt will be in no
particular haste to report the resolution
back to the House. if the resolution
should be passed during the last ten;
days of the session the President could
kill it by refusing to sign it. But it is â 
doubtful in the judgment of a good
many people whether the McEnery
resolution can pass the House.. It does
not meet the approval of the minority,
and a large number of Republicans do j
not believe it will be wise to handicap
the President in the slightest degree at
this time.
HOW THE STEAMSHIP
BULGARIA WAS DISABLED
Rudder Broke During- a Gale and the
Vessel Then Sprang a
Leak.
NEW YORK, Feb. 15.â sailors
rescued from the missing steamer Bul
garia of the Hamburg-American line,
which is supposed to have been lost off
i the Azores the latter part of last week,
have made a statement before the Ger
man Consul in Punta del Gada, who
has cabled it to this city:
"On February 2, during a severe
northwest gale, the rudder broke and
three large and five collapsible boats
were borne away. The ship being then
without a helm pounded tremendously i
and sprang a leak. On the 3d there
was eight feet of water in compartment
No. 4 and the ship heeled over to port.
Over 1000 bags of freight were shifted
from port to starboard without success.
On February 5 we sighted the Weehaw
ken and requested assistance. The first
boat of the Bulgaria took ten passen
gers, but before we were able to take
more the boat was torn away by heavy
seas. The second boat, with Second Of
ficer Sherges and four men, was also :
torn away by the sea before the pas- j
sengers could be taken and we lost j
sight of the vessel. The Weehawken j
launched two boats; one filled with
water and the other saved eight per- i
sons. The Weehawken remained until j
noon on the 6th without seeing the |
Bulgaria again. Two other unknown
steamers were near the Bulgaria, but !
we do not know what aid they gave."

THE SUPREME COURT
Marin County Judge Decides That
Stephen Wade Was Illegally
Imprisoned.
SAN" RAFAEL, Feb. 15.â sentence [
of Stephen Wade was the sentence that j
failed. The convict appeared before Su- [
perior ; Judge F.M. Angellotti in habeas j
corpus proceedings last Monday and to
day his Honor decided that the. prisoner
was entitled to his release from San
Quentln Prison. As the case has been in
the Supreme Court of the State Judge
Angellotti's decision will doubtless be re
plete'with Interest to the California bar.
Wade was convicted of betrayal and
sentenced by the Superior Court of Santa
Clara County to pay a fine of $3000 or
serve 750 days, In the State Prison. The |
case was before the Supreme Court, the i
decision of the lower court was affirmed '
and Wade went to prison.
Last Monday the prisoner appeared be
fore Angellotti on a writ of habeas cor
pus procured by Attorney John E. Rich- !
ards, who made an excellent plea for his i
client on legal lines.* To-day the court !
decided that a man could not be impris
oned in a State Prison for non-payment of !
a fine and Warden Hale was ordered to i
release Wade from custody. He complied ;
with the mandate and the former prisoner j
went en his way rejoicing.

cable to the Journal, dated "Manila,
Feb. 16, 4 a. m.," says: There is much
firing going on to-night In the outskirts

COSTLY FIRE AT
BROOKLYN YARD
Navy Loses Property
Worth a Million.
MACHINE SHOP DESTROYED
FLAMES SWEEP AN OIL-SOAKED
BUILDING.
Many Fine Patterns and Models of
Battleships Lost and the Work
of the Yard Greatly
Retarded-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 15.â Over a million
dollars' worth of Government property
was destroyed by a fire which started
to-night in the large machine shop of
the Brooklyn Navy Yard, known as
machine shop No. 28, and the workings
of the navy yard have received a seri
ous setback. Many flne models and
patterns of battleships, their parts and
plans have been destroyed; and some of
them cannot be obtained again except
by going over the work mapped out in
the beginning.
The steam engineering department of
the Brooklyn yard is practically wiped
out and the work done in that building
will have to be thrown temporarily
upon the department of yards and
docks and that of construction and re
pair.
The fire was discovered and the alarm
given at 6:30 o'clock to-night by the
man on watch of the battleship Massa
chusetts. The men of the Massachu
setts scurried down to the machine
shop about 300 yards away, and with
the aid of a hose reel picked up in the
yard got a small stream playing on the
fire. The building was about 100 feet
in width and 325 feet long. It was four
stories in height and built of stone and
brick. The wood of the inside was
thoroughly saturated with oil and the
flames rapidly gained headway. It was
seen that the Massachusetts* men could !
do but little against the blaze and
Colonel Huntington, in command of the
marines, Joined in the work.
All the engines in the neighborhood of
the navy yard responded to the alarm,
but the firemen found the great ma
chine shop completely enveloped in
flames and attention had to be paid
to the foundry and other buildings in
the vicinity. Several times the flames
got a start on the foundry roof, but
the firemen quickly put them out. A
small corrugated iron building in the
rear of the machine shop was burned,
but the loss on this is insignificant.
The fire made such rapid progress in
CENTRAL PACIFIC
TO PAY ITS DEBT
Definite Arrangement Made at
Last tor Settlement With)
:"â 
Uncle Sam.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â definite agreement for the adjustment of
the debt of the Central .Pacific Railroad to the Government has been ar
rived at between the Government commission and the bankers represent
ing the railroad. Mr. Speyer, the bankers and Secretary Bliss and At
torney General Griggs were at the White House to-day in conference
with the President. It is expected that the papers closing the settlement
will be signed at almost any time. It is understood that the plan con
templates the payment of $58,000,000 to the Government in semi-annual
3 per cent notes, the last expiring ten years from date. These notes will
be secured by Â° a deposit of Central Pacific 4 per cent bonds.
The agreement, it was later learned, will, not be signed for several
days yet and it will depend upon circumstances when it will be finally
concluded, though its general terms have been outlined. Secretary Gage,
one of the members of the Government commission, is out of the city
and of -course final action will not be taken in his absence.
the machine shop that by 8:30 o clock ;
it was pronounced an utter loss. At 11
o'clock the fire had spent itself.
Machine shop No. 28 was occupied by
the coppersmiths, the boiler-makers,
the carpenters and machinists. About
600 people were employed there, but
only two watchmen were in the build
ing at the time of the outbreak of the
fire. Aside from being filled with a
great mass of machinery, more or less I
used, the building was occupied as a
pattern and model shop. Here were j
kept all the models, plans, drawings j
and specifications of work to be done j
on any one of the naval vessels that
were to be repaired at the yard. Many
models of battleships and warships
built from time to time were kept j
there. These were mostly copies of !
models, and their loss, while footing up
considerable from a pecuniary point,
will not be irreparable. The steam en
gineering department had a number of
elaborate plans which were originated
in this yard, and they cannot be re
placed. Â , , I
In the machine shop very little work
was on hand. A number of small or
ders were being filled for the torpedo- |
boats McKee, Rogers, Foote and Por- j
ter, and some engine fittings were be- !
ing turned out for the Newark, Scor- I
pion and Indiana.
The records and models of the battle- |
ship Maine, which was blown up in I
Havana harbor on February 15. 1898,
were also destroyed. The loss to the ]
building is placed at $350,000: that on !
the machinery and lathes in the build
ing at $400,000. The cost of the models
and patterns is variously estimated,
but officials In the yard put the total
loss at a little over $1,000,000. The cause
of the fire is unknown as yet.

REV. DR. CRABB
WROTE BURNING
WORDS OF LOVE
Alleged Note in Which He Told His Wife of
His Infatuation for Miss
Perry.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 15.â The Rev. Wil
liam D. Crabb never spent a more un
comfortable afternoon in his life than
he did to-day in Judge Kittredge's
courtroom. As chief witness for him
j self, in the divorce . suit that has
' shocked the church-going community
of this State, he was, metaphorically
speaking, grilled by his wife's attor
ney, M. C. Hassett. The latter was
unmerciful in his inquiries, compelling
the reverend gentleman from San
1 Francisco to give a complete history
| of his past and minutely examining
I into the evidence he gave on direct ex
'â â  amination. This had the effect of
; making him very weary and the an
nouncement of adjournment was a wel
come relief.
/' Shortly before he was permitted to
leave his unenviable seat, the defend
ant's counsel sprang the sensation of
the day. It was in the form of a doc
ument in the handwriting of his wife
and, when it was presented to him for
perusal, a , perceptible tremor passed :
over him, as it was virtually a con
fession of his affection for Miss Carrie
I Perry, the choir singer of Gilroy, who
j under the biblical name of "Esther"
! was honored with burning thoughts
I that coursed through the doctor's pen,
and which he styled "poetry." Al
though the witness remembered hav
ing seen the lines, he was loth to ad
mit authorship. Strenuous objection
was made against its admission by At
torney Cobb, for the plaintiff, who ap
preciated the importance of the docu
ment, and the court ruled it out for
the present on the ground that there
was not sufficient evidence to show that
the original had ever existed. The
most material parts of this startling
confession of " love read as follows:
"We both love each other with all the
powers of our being, with an all-con
suming love. We wish one another's
company as much as we can have it.
We tell one another these things and
express in writing words of affection.
* * * But all words and writing are
pure. If I should outlive you we may
be married, if she still feels as now toÂ»
ward me. * * * She knows how bar
ren and dead my heart was until sud
denly awakened to life and a depth of
love never surpassed. Her love for me
absorbs all her very being. We will
be pure and seek only our good and
not work to harm any one else. Be pa
tient with us, by the knowledge you
have of an all-consuming love. We
beg of you to be patient with us and
let us be a comfort to one another."
According to Mrs. Crabb's counsel,

she exhibited it to Crabb's brother in
Pomona, in the presence of her hus
band. He denies having written the
original, of which this paper was a
copy. Mrs. Crabb's counsel intends
proving by her and reliable witnesses
that he did write the document. They
declare he gained possession of the or
iginal and destroyed it. Â° '
Another feature of the day was a let
ter written to Dr. Crabb by his wife,
in which she criticized the trustees of
the Methodist church at Gilroy fop
their action in concurring with Dr.
Crabb that it would be best for her to
remain in ' California, it sarcastically
dubbing them "sweet Christians of
Gilroy, in the influence and power of a
lone woman."
The doctor will be on the witness
stand again to-morrow to finish his
cross-examination and be confronted
with the numerous letters to his wife
after their separation in January, 1897.
MORE REINFORCEMENTS.
PROMOTION FOR OTIS
NEW/- YORK, Feb. 15.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
That it may be available for service
in the Philippines, should Otis consider
. additional troops necessary, the War
Department to-day issued orders di
recting the Ninth Regiment of Infan
try, now stationed at Madison Bar
racks and other posts in New York
State, to proceed at once to the De
partment of California.
While the authorities have insisted
that Otis has sufficient troops to main
tain his position and to pursue Agui
naldo's forces should he deem it advis
able to do so, it is apDre-iated that it
will soon be necessary to station gar
risons at practically all points in the
islands which were occupied by Span
ish troops before the war. Otis will be
reinforced by about 7000 men when all
the troops now under orders to pro
ceed to Manila reach their destination,
making a total force of about 30,000
men, including those at; Iloilo.
Besides the expected prompt ratifica
tion of the Paris treaty, by. the Spanish
Government will make it necessary to
relieve the volunteer troops and bring
them to the United States. It is there
fore considered desirable to have sev
eral regiments in readiness to dispatch
to Manila, and the Ninth la the first
selected.
Instructions have been sent to Otis
directing him to instruct Miller to put
In force at Iloilo the same tariff in ope
ration at Manila. It la proposed to
place this tariff in force at all ports in
the islands immediately after they are
occupied by American troops. i
Miller's appointment as brigadier
general in the regular army has been
greeted with much satisfaction in army
circles as indicative of the intention of
the President to reward every officer
and man in the Philippines distinguish
ing himself.
The authorities are desirous of re
warding Otis, and he will probably re
ceive the brevet of major general in
the regular service, he now being se
nior brigadier general, though holding
a volunteer commission as major gen
eral.
There Is reason to believe that Gen
eral Otis would be one of the first of
ficers promoted to the grade of ma jot
general should the army reorganiza
tion bill become a law, and his friends
say* that his services entitle him to
consideration in connection with the of
fice of lieutenant general in case. that
grade should be revived. It is expected j
that the board on brevets now in
session will be directed to consider the
meritorious and gallant services of of
ficers iii connection with the campaign
against the insurgents.
BARNESON TO MANAGE
THE TRANSPORT FLEET
Official Recognition of the Expert '
Handling of the Troopship
Arizona.
3 TACOMA, Feb. To.â Friends of Cap- I
tain John Barneson of Port Townsend
believe \ that within a few days ihe will
be given the management of the United
States transport fleet operating be
tween San Francisco and Manila, with
the title of assistant quartermaster. He
is said to have received the indorse
ments of. Admiral Dewey, and General
Merritt, .which were given in ! conse
quence of Barneso'n's expert handling
of the troopship Arizona, last summer.
: Within five days after the Arizona's ar
rival at Manila he had her .': cleared ; of
I all soldiers, besides several thousand,
tons of supplies. This rapid work was
in* marked contrast with" the unloading
of the other transports, j causing Barne- }
son's retention by the Government ; to *
load other troop ships at* San Fran- |
cisco. Captain- W. .W. Robinson, as
sistant quartermaster, U. S. A., now in
Washington, has strongly recommend
ed Barneson. - 3

WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â the
meeting of the Woman's Council to

Union, delivered an address on "The
Relations Between the Council and
Peace and Arbitration." At the com

of the world would ask the nations for
nothing less than disarmament.
There was considerable discussion on
the subject matter of the address, those
participating including Mrs. Belva A.
Lockwood of this city and Mrs. Eliza

latter declared the Spanish war was
simply a matter of brute force and set
tled only which country had the most
money and ability to defeat the other.

LIVED MORE THAN
FIVE SCORE YEARS
Passing of a Yaqui( Who Was
Born Before the Present
-***. Century.
SALINAS, Feb. 10.-Antonio Parito, one of the Yaqul tribe of Mexi
can Indians, supposed to be the oldest inhabitant of Monterey
County, as well as. of this portion of the State, is dead, after "ax
ing lived more than five score years. The exact age of Parito Â«
not known, and even himself was not aware how old he was When
asked the question he would become quite angered, and would reply inÂ«
-c â â  . _ he did not know and did not
care, philosophically explain
ing that if he did know he
would -worry and consequently
die .sooner. Some of the old
est inhabitants claim that the
old man must have been.near
ly 110. He was in these parts
In the early in these was
h.*- early '50s, and was
even then past the prime of *,
life, 'although robust and a Â°
hard-working man.
From the records kept I **â¢
r the Catholic priests and other
data, Parito was at least IC*
years old. He was alwav* a
devout Romanist. Just b*fvÂ«^e
his death he Best for Â»** p-ftes*
of this parish, but b*fc*re th*.
priest could get to the Ntd*i>S*
of the dying Indian it wa* svx>
lateâ the old YaquTs awil had
departed for th* -'_-*â¢*>'*Â»*
hunting ground--" Purt-ie
Parito's long aflttlatleto with
the church he never lost the
tribal belief, the "happy hunt
ing ground tradition, Â«d
--though in every other respect he was entirely Christian-,
Parito was always averse to telling his life's history, but it Is known
it was filled with romance and adventure. He always said he would
die at the close of this century, and lately asserted thai he- would liv*
until the end of this week.
Parito was born on the Yaaui River. Sonora, at about IT3O, He was
banished with the rest of his tribe in IS.*. He did not arrive tn this
part of the country until early In the *50's. Parito was accompanied
on his departure from his native heath by another Taqui Indian. Pedro
Locero. and these two remained life-long friends. Locero was older
than his companion. He died here about two months ago. and was
about 11- years old. From Locero it was gained that he and Parito when
banished went from place to place, always coming north. They flnally
reached the Los Angeles Mission, where they remained some time and
were converted to the Romanist faith. The two men parted company
and did not see each other for many years. Both turned up in this
county and remained together ever afterward.
Parito's first work in this county was that of herding sheep for S. B.
Gordon Sr., near Jamesburg. in the foothills south of this city. During
this employment a strange trait evinced itself in the Indian. He made it
a rule not to draw any pay for at least three years and then demand it
all at once. He would disappear and be gone about a week, part of ,
which time was spent in carousals in this city. After the spree was over
and he was poorer by about $1500 he would return- to work for another
three years. Mexican saloon-keepers would present bills * against
Parito for sums as high as $500. Unlike his race,' he would always order
them paid by his employer, although many times he did not owe such
large amounts. He remained in the employ of Mr. Gordon twenty
seven years, after which he earned a livelihood by chopping wood until
he was taken to the County Hospital. 3
THE- LATE ANTONIO PARITO
SILL INVESTORS
LOSE THEIR LAND
Bought on the Install
ment Plan.
REAL ESTATE FIRM FAILS
HAD SOLD A BONDED TRACT
TO ITS PATRONS.
Property Reverts to Its Original
Owners and the Investors Are
Out the Payments They
Hade.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS. Feb. 15.â Through a de
cision of Judge Dorn in the Superior
Court of this county many persons in
San Francisco who can ill afford it will
lose not only the property that they
thought would soon be theirs, but also
the money they have already invested
in it. They have absolutely no re
dress upon the owners of the prop
erty.
33 A former real estate firm of San
Francisco, the Carnall-Hopkins Com
pany, now out of business, sold land
upon the installment plan to small sal
aried men and women. The firm- went
through insolvency and the people who
had been putting up their small pay
ments for several years lost through
the failure. The case which brought
these facts to light was that of C. G.
Meyer, a grocery-man of San Fran
cisco,' vs. Francis Doud of Monterey,
the owner of the property in question.
Meyer sued Doud for possession of the
land.
From the testimony It seems so. _
time in IS&4 the Carnall-Hopkins Com
pany bonded a large area of land near
Monterey and just adjoining this city,
agreeing to pay a large sum, which it
hoped to realize by selling the land in
town lots to San Franciscans on small
payments and light interest. The land
was platted and the purchasers were
many. In the case of Meyer he shows
receipts fur about $1400 paid in.
When the real estate firm failed he
owed a balance of about $100. This
amount he offered to Doud and asked
for a deed to the property. .. The deed
was not forthcoming, as Doud had re
ceived none of the money on any of
the Installments, and, in fact, the con
tract with the real estate dealers had
been forfeited. Meyer brought suit in
San Francisco, but I >oud got a change
of venue 'to this court. The case has
been tried. Meyer's attorneys claimed-
Doud was responsible for the acts of
his agents, but the defendant's attor
neys produced Doud's contract with the
Carnall-Hopkins Company and made a
motion for a nonsuit, which was
granted.
Judge- Dorn in granting the motion
said there was nothing to show that
the defendant had obtained any money
or that he knew anything about indi
vidual sales. The purchaser should
have inquired Into the contract before
investing. -â  . . / 7. .-â â  ;-â  â â ','";.
Many San Franciscans who are In a
position Identical with that of Meyer
are affected by the decision.
STANFORD'S VICE PRESIDENT.
Dr. John Caspar Branner Advanced
to the Position.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 15-
Dr. Branner, head of the geology depart
ment and chairman of tho ways and
means committee, was to-day made per-
I S , v, nen L vice P r Â«ident of the university.
, This office, although created by -Senator
1 Stanford, has never been regularly filled,

John Caspar Branner was a classmate of
Dri Jordan at Cornell. Before taking his
â  degrees, however, he had much valuable
! experience as a geologist. From 1-75-78
he was assistant geologist on the imperial
geological survey of Brazil. Later he
i became a special botanist for Thomas A.
i Edison in Brazil. He took his B.S. degree
at Cornell in 1882, and then became spe
cial agent of the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture for investigating cot
: ton and insects affecting it in. Brazil.. In
19-5 he took his doctor s decree at the
University of Indiana, accepting soon af
terward the chair of geology in this insti
tution. This place he filled until 1891,
when he came to Stanford. From 18_7
I to 1592 he was also State Geologist of Ar

s-ome of his â â¢tors, who already
have obtained judgments against him.
Tc-day Wright had tv\o heeds to his

from H. Ward Wright to Mary G.

Of the Union Savings Bank, In which
he states that on that date Wright In

property to his wife. The certificate

Is attached, and shows that Wright ac
knowledged the deed before him on
January' SO, 1599. This was two days
before the bank failure and shows con

for the crash. " /L-
A few minutes later a deed was filed
in which H. Ward Wright and his wife
convey the same property to the Union
Savings Bank. No consideration is
mentioned, but revenue stamps on the
document show it to be $15,000. This
last document is dated February 15.
On December 20 last Wright had a
deed recorded by which his home was
transferred to G. W. Miller. The in

and acknowledged December 20, 1898.
On the following day a deed, in which
Miller transferred the same .property
back to Wright, a cnt on record. It
was dated January 4. 1897, and ac

wife he says that on June 2. 1898,
! Wright told him he had deeded the
place to his wife. This is a curious
j state of affairs, for after that time
Miller had a deed placed on record In
which he owned the property conveyed
to Mrs. Wright. About the time Wright
conveyed the property to Miller in Jan
uary, 1897, the bank was tottering and
about to collapse. The making of the
deed to Miller is believed to have been
done to save something from the wreck
that was then expected, but which did
not come till two years later.
The Wright residence has been levied
upon on an attachment issued in Tu
lare County to secure the payment of
a $4000 promissory note. The attach
ment was filed nearly a- week ago and
consequently will hold against these
deeds. '. ' .
On Monday Wright deeded eighty
two acres ( of land at Wrights station
to the bank, but this was done only
afte*- - the* property was levied upon to
satisfy a $2000 judgment.
The stockholders of the Union Sav
ings Bank have held a meeting and
several of them are In favor of fight
ing the levying of assessments. They
have appointed a committee, consisting
of Dr. Ledyard, J. L. Leiter and J, W.
Rea, to look Into the matter. The
stockholders are opposed to the pres
ent board of directors settling up the
bank's business, and they will, it is
said, ask it to resign. This commutes
will report at a meeting of the stock
holders to be held in about a week.

spondent of the Dally News says: It
turns .nit that -General Mercier, In his

ant of the fact that this was an illegal
proceeding, adding that In his profes
sional experience it had often been
done before. Mercier further asserted
thai M. Dupuy. M. Faure and M.

TO A DUMB BEAST
SAN RAFAEL. Feb. 15.â A. P. Towne.
a capitalist who owns nearly all the Und
between Point San Pedro and McNear a
Point, and 1$ estimated to be worth $150,
--000. was arrested to-day for a flagrant
case of cruelty to animals. He pleaded
guilty and was fined $10.

vention of Cruelty to Animals saw Towne
driving a horse so emaciated that every
rib could be counted. He warned Towne
not to drive the animal again under pen
alty of arrest. To-day the horse was
driven again and the arrest followed.
Towne admitted that he was in the
wrong, as the horse was nearly 53 years
of age, but pleaded that he was afraid
to drive a young animal. Justice Rodden
excoriated Towne. but fined him only $10
on account of it being the first offense.

KNOCKED OUT
FOR SESSION
Fate of Nicaragua Canal
Bill Settled.
HEPBURN'S PLAN DEFEATED
. \ .
AMENDMENT TO SUNDRY CIVIL
BILL VOTED DOWN.
An Exceedingly Spirited Debate Fol
lowed by the Decision to Uphold
the Ruling of the Chair
on House Rules.
Special Dispatch to The Call. , ,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â House
to-day settled the fate of the Nicara
gua canal bill in this Congress by re
fusing to override the decision of the
chair in committee of the whole, when
the chair held that the canal bill of
fered as an amendment by Hepburn
was out of order. The friends of the
Nicaragua bill were very confident yes
terday and to-day that they would tri
umph, but after four hours of debate
the chair was sustained, 127 to 109.
Bailey, the Democratic leader, made
an argument in favor of the view that
the amendment was Injirder.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio bore the brunt
of the argument to-day in behalf of
this contention. Moody (R.) of Massa
chusetts, Dockery (D.) of Missouri and
Fleming (D.) of ueorgia were pitted
against him. The debate throughout
the day was exceedingly spirited, and
in the end a majority of the members
refused to override the* House rules.
No record is made of the vote in com
mittee of the whole. Party lines were
not adhered to, the division In favor
and in opposition to sustaining the
chair's decision being about equal on
both sides of the political aisles.
About ten pages of the sundry civil bill
were disposed of.
Chinaman's Sudden Death.
WOODLAND, Feb. 13.â A Chinaman
employed on the Scofleld farm, near Dun
nlgan, in cutting wood, went to town on
Tuesday to celebrate Chinese New Year.
Some time during the afternoon he left
for home, apparently in good health. He
was not again seen until his lifeless body
was found in the evening, lying under a
tree on the farm on which he worked.
There was nothing in the surroundings to
indicate foul play and the presumption is
that he died from natural causes. Depu
ty Coroner Apperson left for Dunnlgan
this morning to Investigate.
Yolo County Needs Bain.
WOODLAND, Feb. 15.â The tempera
ture has fallen several degrees during the
last twenty-four hours. A strong north
wind prevails and farmers and fruit
growers are becoming seriously concerned
about the lack of rain. Neither grain nor
trees yet show signs of suffering, but the
lateness of the season and the backward
ness of the crops arouse apprehension.

MENTO, Feb. 15.â Mayor Phelan, Charles
L. Pat ton, Henry Crocker, JohnLackmann
and J. a. Filcher appeared to-night be
fore the Committee on Ways and Means
of the Assembly, to set forth the plans
they have matured for the big Pacific
Coast and International Exposition, to
take place in San Francisco in the spring,
summer and autumn of 1901. The expo
sition of their plans' was simply explana
tory of and secondary to the bill which
they had had introduced In both Senate
and Assembly, which binds the State to
donate $500 toward the success of the
big undertaking. " . -'"3
The bill was introduced by Assembly
man Cobb of San Francisco early In the
week, and it has since been hurried
through the State Printing Office and
placed early on the file of the committee.
When the .San. Francisco delegation ar
rived at the Capitol to-night they were
prepared to make every argument and
defend every point that might be brought
up, but they found no use for either
3 course. The committee , was already en
: thused over the plan and thoroughly con
â¢vinced of its feasibility and of the Im
mense profit that would come out of It to
' the State. The only question was on the
.-form of v the bill and upon the best In

.- amount of money that is asked for.

GOVERNOR GAGE FAVORS THE
INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION
:' : 3. : 3 ;'-"â .-: â  CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Feb. 15.
**-â¢â¢' The exposition committee, consisting of Charles L. Patton, Henry J. Crocker, John Lackmann and J A.
â¢ 'Filcher, of San Francisco, and Mayor Land of Sacramento, had an extended audience .with Governor Gage this
: afternoon. The Governor manifested a keen interest in everything that the members of the committee had to
offer in support of the enterprise. He asked many questions concerning the plans of the exposition, the grounds
: the; buildings and the general scope and purposes of the project. Mayor Land of this city co-operated with the
San Francisco delegates and gave his hearty commendation of the scheme. ; ..-.
*;.â¢â¢:â¢. ;'â¢ The Governor was guarded in his expression as to the amount that should be appropriated for the expo
sition. He did. not say in so many words that he would approve an appropriation but what he did say gave : the
(â¢: committeemen encouragement and left the impression on their. minds that he was decidedly favorable to the expo
-3 sition measure now pending in the Legislature. . - Â«!â--â¢Â«,â
â¢"3.:-.- "The Governor explained to Messrs. Crocker, Patton. Lackmann, Filcher and Land that the money ap
propriated should be made payable in 1000 and 1901, and should not be drawn from the funds at present in the State
--treasury. It was suggested by Mayor Land that an appropriation of $350,000 might be sufficient support for the
State to extend in aid of the enterprise. / . c-',.- Â«-.;;._
V : After the conference with the Governor the members of the committee saw quite a number of Senators
and/Assemblymen, and derived from them assurance that the bill providing for an allowance oi public money to
â further the exposition project would receive fair consideration. A favorable report is expected from the As
' - sembly Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Finance Committee.

money in one single payment. He was as
sured by the delegation that it would not j
be necessary. More than anything else,
they wanted " the State's assurance that
the $500,000 asked for would be eventually
forthcoming. It might be paid over in
two "payments in two fiscal years, or it
might be arranged any way that would
beSt suit, the finances of the State. It :
was the assurance and the standing that j
Â« -500,000 credit would give that the com- â 
mittee desired mere than the actual cash.
Mayor Phelan was first to address the
committee.- He explained at some length j
the plan that has been arranged for j
financing the scheme and of the prom- I
ise of success that is held out. He said
It was the intention of the committee to 1
ask the Federal Government for another
$500,000; and that there is practically no j
doubt that the Government will comply 1
with the request, as it has already es
tablished a precedent in the cases of the
.Tennessee, Omaha and other expositions, j
It is also the intention, he said, to ask j
the city of San Francisco- for $750,000,
making an aggregate of $1,750,000 which '
the fair promoters will have as a work- ,
ing capital. I
Charles L. Paton backed up the Mayor s
"remarks and added a few of his own, and j
... was followed by Henry Crocker, who j
spoke from a purely commercial, stand
point to illustrate the impetus that would |
be given trade both transcontinental and j
transpacific by such an exposition as is j
proposed. Already the increase in our
Oriental trade is so noticeable that San ;
Francisco merchants are complaining be
cause their freight is sidetracked to make
wav for the through freight bound from
the South to the Orient. He said that
California was the nearest seaboard to all
the vast trade of China, and that with
the "open door" policy in operation Cali
fornia, and particularly San Francisco,
would be the greatest beneficiary as the
only port of entry. "John Lackmann and
J. A. Filcher also spoke at length on the
project. The committee, by unanimous
vote, agreed to recommend the bill for j
passage. . '
SILURIAN ELEMENT IN MINORITY.
-- â  - â â â -.'â â -. â  - ,
All propositions of progress and im
provement are alike to seme people, just
bo soon as it appears that they are not
to gain all the prestige or profit. No mat
ter what the intrinsic merits of the en
terprise may be, or how great is to be
the benefit to 99 per cent of ,. the, people
nt large, this Silurian element, either will
fully or mistakenly presumes to present
Its narrow-minded views as those of the
general public. It has been so in the
case of the projected Pacific Ocean Ex
position. \-
Notwithstanding that the Fall 'of 1901
has back of it the approval and support
of the best men in the city of Sal. Fran
cisco and of the State, as shown by the
facts already published in relation to it,
this discredited element has had it lit
tle hammer out ever since the project has
been under discussion. The latest disrepu
table and covert attack made on the x
position is the claim that the labor!
classes and the bankers are opposed *<*>
It, and that fairs are of no benefit to the
city or section in which they are held.

A.S. BALDWIN EXPOSES
ABSURD ARGUMENTS
A. 'â '&. Baldwin, a member of the real |
estate firm of Baldwin & Hammond, and
who has the reputation of being one of
the most progressive and public-spirited
men of the State, is one of the original
fifteen men appointed on the Pacific j
Ocean and International Committee by !
Mayor Phelan. Speaking of these sophis- j
ticated. objections to the grand enterprise j
of bringing San Francisco before the
world as the great commercial metropolis
of the United States on the Pacific Ocean, |
be said:
"It has been falsely argued that
the workingmen of San Francisco and
California will not be benefited by
the fair because it will attract un
employed mechanics from other sec
tions of. the country. This argument
is not worth considering, for nothing j
is easier than to give the preference \
to our own mechanics. Look at the *
Dewey boulevard. Were : not the |
workingmen of San Francisco em
ployed in preference to those from ,
outside the State? * Even if the fair
does bring mechanics to our city, it
will not prevent our own from hav
ing the first choice, and besides, there
will be work enough for all, so that
as far as this absurd argument is
concerned, any sensible person may
dismiss it once and for all.
"It is true the banks are begin
ning to make ugly faces because they
claim their business will be affected
by the increased taxation. The in
creased taxation will be so infinitesi
mally small that it will not be felt
by the banks. It is a display of poor
judgment on their part to throw any
sort of a damper on such an im
portant event, especially when as a
result of the fair the increase in valu
ation to property in San Francisco
will be hundreds of times more than '
any increase in taxation. The banks
will be greatly benefited as a result
of this fair being held here.
"The final and most absurd reason
against the holding of the fair is that
such exhibitions are not successful,
and that as a result of the war the
one that it is proposed to hold here
will be materially affected. I would
like to call attention to the recent
exposition/, held at Omaha. It was
attended by every disadvantage that
could possible have arisen as a result
of the war, and yet it was such an
unprecedented success that its man
agers have organized an exposition
corporation which will hold an ex
position this year to be known as the
Greater American Exposition for the
purpose of showing the novel and at- j
tractive exhibits, peoples, products
and manufactures of the islands of
the sea recently acquired by the
United States.
"Now, if this can be done by a city
situated as Omaha what should not be
done by San Francis.- In the fair it is
proposed to hold here this city has a fu
ture that not even criminal negligence
can excuse for it not being grasped and
made the most. of. As a result of the
events of the past year, which have
caused San Francisco to suddenly become
the second city of importance in the
United States, it is absolutely necessary
that this fair should be held to prove to
the world, and especially to the people
of this country, that our advantages and
natural location here gives us our de
served prominence.
OAKLAND IS SOLID.
! OAKLAND, Feb. Mayor Thomas-
There cannot surely be two opinions as
to the duty of Californlans to have a
great exposition on this coast- The value
of such an exhibition of the possibilities
of the coast as it is proposed to make
cannot be overestimated. California needs
nothing so much as advertising. If people
will only come here there -will be no
trouble in building up a great population,
for the natural resources of the State will
do the rest. It is a duty to bring all the
money and people to California that we
possibly can. I cannot see a single valid
objection that can be raised against the
proposed exposition of 1901.. -.
George W. Arper, president Merchants'
Exchangeâ California's greatest necessity
at this time is a great exposition. We go
East and tell people of this State and
they will not believe us. The only way to
convince Eastern folk of the truth of the
claims we make for California is to get
them out here and let them see for them
selves. The Paciiic Ocean Exposition will
do more for this coast than anything else
I can think of. It will attract people
from all parts of the world and- every
visitor who comes will henceforth be â¢ a
missionary of progress for California. The
Merchants' Exchange has not yet taken
up the matter officially, but it is safe to
say that it will get to work at the proper
time and do all it can to boom the enter
prise.
E. C. Sessions, director Board of Tradeâ
This great opportunity to do something
truly great for California should be made
the most of. Our board has already dis
cussed the matter and will do everything
ced the matter and will do everything
to advance the exposition. California is
well able to do something that will as
tonish the world and it is her duty to
do it.
CALIFORNIA'S BIG OPPORTUNITY.
STOCKTON, Feb. 15.â Mayor William
Inglis when seen this evening said:
"I am heartily in favor of the exposi
tion and would like to see the Legislature
Insure the success of the project by a .
substantial appropriation. San Francisco
is, by the- trend of national .events, des
tined to become a second Liverpool. That
dry cannot progress without ihe res. of
:. â¢ State sharing its glory and. pros
perity- For every dollar the State spends
on the exposition it will reap a hundred
lolii. I believe the entire community will
lend -hearty co-operation to the promot
ers tfithe enterprise when they understand
the matter more fully. As for me, I
favor It. I do not see how any citizen
-imbued, with the proper spirit can feel
otherwise.' . : '-'â 'â¢ â :â â¢'â > â -.. ,^-* V
Supervisor Orrin S. .Henderson said:
"The State cannot afford to allow this
great opportunity to" pass. The Legisla
ture should take action as soon as pos
sible. Tii members * will certainly do so
if the people make their, wishes known.
California the State most favored under
our newlj 'acquired- commercial advan
tages, mus*. show the other States and the
world that she is equal to her opportuni- \
ties. If 'the Legislature will take action ,
the counties and cities will do so. This j

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THTJR SPAT, FEBRUARY 16, 1899.,
Joaquin Valley "favorable to the holding
of an elaborate international exposition
on a broad and comprehensive plan in the
city of' San Francisco in 1901. - No one of
the prominent business men of the town
thus far interviewed by The Call corre
spondent has opposed the project. The
popular sentiment is set forth in an in
terview had with Mr. E. H. Chapin, the
chairman of the Board of Supervisors. In
response to the many questions on the
subject Mr. Chapin Said':
"There is no question in my mind that
since the passage by the United States
Senate of the peace treaty, which prac
tically insures a great increase in our
trade with the Orient, the center of
trade will naturally move from -the East
to San Francisco, and I think it is the
duty of every wide-awake citizen of this
State to do all in his power to help along
the movement that plainly means the im
mediate development of this coast and
particularly California. Our trouble here
tofore has been that our territory being
limited the demand for our products was
also limited. It is a well-known fact that
one great trouble has been and ls now in
being unable to get the people of the
East to come to this coast in order that
they might know what we can produce.
An exposition on a grand scale, held at
a time of the year when the people are
freezing to death in the East, as they are
just now, would do more than any other
one thing to turn the tide of immigration
our wav, advertise our products^ stimt*u
late trade, as well as tend to develop the
manufacturing industries by creating a
new demand for their output. Whatever
brings population, whatever helps intro
duce our resources and increases trade
and commerce should be encouraged. \\ c
should do all in our power to manufacture
our own raw material . and not ship it
East to be manufactured and shipped
back for our consumption, as we are do
ing at present. I believe that such an
exposition would be "1" very material ben
efit to this coast and am convinced that
the people of this State would be war
ranted in uniting their efforts and going
to any â¢ reasonable expense to show the
world what we have for sale."

THE MINING INDUSTRY
WOULD BE BENEFITED
NEVADA CITY, Feb. 15.â Mayor Jackson, who is also
County Treasurer, said to-night: "Months ago,
when The Call first advanced the proposition to
hold a world's fair in San Francisco in 1901, the Board of
Trustees of Nevada City saw the wisdom of the suggestion,
and by a resolution that was unanimously adopted and
! ordered spread upon the minutes gave its enthusiastic
and .unqualified indorsement to the proposition. We
have seen no reason since to reconsider that action. On
the other hand, as the time originally set for the exposi
tion draws nearer and nearer, we have grown stronger
in the belief that would be for. the substantial and
lasting benefit of the whole State and Coast to carry out
The Call's suggestion. ; .. 33. Â;
"The Legislature could not do anything for us that
would accomplish more real good than to make a liberal
appropriation to this end. The gold mining industry,
which is the mainstay of this part of the State, would
receive a tremendous impetus from a proper representa
tion of its methods, products and possibilities in such an
exposition."
doubtedly fall in love with a land where
the sun shines and the flowers . bloom;
while all the Eastern cities are undergo
ing the hardships of blizzards, and would
make their future homes here. To my
mind this project deserves the support of
every Senator, and Assemblyman new at
Sacramento, and a bill providing for a
suitable appropriation should go through
with a rush."- : : -3*.:- ;
TAKES MONEY AND BRAINS.
HEALDSBURG. Feb. Mayor Wil
liam H." Barnes said, regarding the pro
posed fair:
. "I. believe an exposition in 1901, of. the
character contemplated, would be of vast
benefit to the State of California. With
our new possessions San Francisco is des
tined to become one of the leading com
mercial cities of the continent and no bet- |
ter method of advertising the city and
State could, be adopted tnan by holding !
this exposition. It will take money, I
brains and enterprise to carry it through i
successfully, and. obtain lasting benefit, j
but if San Francisco and the State of
California are to take advantage of their
opportunities that are now in their hands :
the people must furnish these requisites." I

nent young business men of this place:
P. W. Morseâ am in' favor, of the
projected exposition in 1901. _â¢'
James Sheehy, merchantâ heartily
indorse the proposition. We need more
people here, more industrial enterprises,
and the way to obtain them is to adver
tise. The exposition would be the best
advertisement we could have.
R. P. Quinnâ need to draw people
here to learn our resources. Many erron
eous impressions are abroad concerning
California, which will be corrected by per
sonal acquaintance with the State, so by
all means let us have the exposition.
JUST THE PROPER TIME.
SANTA CRUZ, Feb. 15.â H. Lamb,
Mayor of the city of Santa Cruz, when
interviewed this evening on the advisabil
ity of holding an exposition in San Fran
cisco in 1901, was enthusiastic over the
matter, saying: . .
"I am heartily in favor of holding the ex
position and think it just the proper thing
at the present time in view of the favor
able outlook for business here and abroad,
especially in the far East.** I think the
people of this county will be heartily in
favor of it. I believe a very liberal ap
propriation of money should be made by
our representatives in the Assembly and
Senate, as It is certainly greatly to tho
interest of California and entire coast to
have an exposition of this kind."

BEAUTIFUL WATER COLORS/
J Frank McComas Opens His Ex
hibition at W. K. Vickery's.
J. Frank McComas of Australia has on
exhibition at the gallery, o. W. K. vVicK
erv 23* Post street, an exhibition, of wa
ter'colors. The exhibition opened yes
.erday and will be on for the next two
weeks The subjects treated are mainly
rand-cape- views .of Australia, Samoa.
Hawaii and California. The young
artist who has only teen in this country
for two months, has worked hard and
covered a vast area of ground, tor the
exhibition contains no less than a dozen
sfudies of California, and the range is
from Tamalpais to Monterey, taking in
San Francisco and Mill Valley. ;
Mr McComas Is a young artist, who
has 'in view several years of study, in
Europe for the purpose Â« of comparing
schools, broadening his- own ideas . and
Perfecting himself generally in his art.
{__ comes by the way of America for the
purpoâ¢ of trying to familiarize j himself
with our country and to see something of
our native art. To begin with the exhl
hiton i" striking. While It Is true that
Mr McComas has so far limited himself,
that is in his present exhibition, to water
colors there ,'is no denying the fact that
his work bears the imprint of true genius.
This is best vouched for by the individual
and intelligent style the artist has de
veloped. 'In his treatment of solid colors
the effect is very pronounced' and pleas
ing while none of the less noticeable ls
the suggestive result of "the subject
treated.
It may be said that perhaps Mr. Mc-
Comas has to a greater or less degree
worked out his ideas along imitative lines.
This would be hardly fair to him. for
while he has observed some well-known
laws of construction, that are so pro
nounced in certain celebrated artists, still
there Is originality in every sweep of his
brush. It speaks for itself and is not to
be denied.
"Ferry Lane," Sydney, and "The
Storm," in tha Hawaiian Islands, are two
examples of brush work that defy criti
cism.' They are original and bold, hav
ing been built on genius rather than law.
They, stand for something new that must
be respected in the way of a departure,
until the world shall decide whether the.
new genius has taken undue license with
art. * . â  -* â¢ 33:-:

TRAGEDY AND . DESTINY.
YESTERDAY flags were flying half-masted in
'honorvpf-the men who a year, ago perished
is the : 'M'aine went "d'owr- They had been mur
dered by treachery most foul, but so far as it is per
mitted human agency, to avenge a wrong the score
has been more than evened. For life, life has. been
exacted, and for the destruction of our ship, fleets
have, been -swept from the sea.
But great as was. the horror at the deed of unpro
voked slaughter, keen as was the thirst for-jus
tice; it is hardly probable that anybody could pierce
the future so as to discern that which since has hap
pened. The tragedy of a ship has become the tragedy
of a nation. : and it may be that the very life of
another and a greater nation will some day go out
because of ihe policy inaugurated when America,
quivering with holy wrath, arose in her awful might
to "remember the Maine." ' ' : â 'â¢â â 
Because one* ship was destroyed, and the brave
men- who c -were sleeping, unsuspicious and unafraid,
were coffined in her shattered hulk, to-day Spain is
without a navy, her valiant soldiers rest in unnamed
.graves, -her possessions have been taken from her.
and there is left to her nothing but the -memory of
glory departed. But we have not been - unscathed.
On alien shores is heard the tread of our. armies.-
Under the heights of Santiago and* the walls of.
Manila our dead are at peace. -We think of them
with heartache and with tears, even as of those above
whom affection strewed flowers yesterday at Havana.
The Maine has been remembered, and forever it
will be remembered, for when .those who live now and
know its story shall have been called, there will still
remain a consciousness that even in war with a
weaker power Americans displayed courage and
achieved fame. And there will remain problems the
blowing up of the Maine made possible, questions of
policy, mayhap the chance of fatal error. " .";
For the time let all this pass. Let us. honor the
bravery that went to death, and the bravery which is
ready to go, nor dwell upon the somber problems
which patriotism and diplomacy must face.
REGULATE THE SHYLOCKS.
-.' .*,,*â¢ 3 " â*
THERE are in this city, and probably in ail
other cities, a set of men who lend, money on
terms a burglar would blush to exact. They
demand triple security, extortionate interest, payable
in advance, and as a rule,* after having received in
interest much more than the face of the loan,
take advantage of the first lapse and foreclose. They
are simply pawnbrokers who do not pay license, and
they should be made, not only to do this, but to so
transact their business that it would not be robbery,
as now it often is. A person once in the clutches of
one of these financiers is a helpless serf, toiling to
fatten a master, and unhappily the law permits it.
When necessity forces a man to mortgage his humble
possessions, and pay io per cent a month interest. !
that man is being as cruelly despoiled as though held
up at the point of a pistol.
The class of brokers who shave warrants seem also
tt need attention. If a teacher hypothecate his salary
warrant for a certain month, and the city, having- ac
cepted his services, refuse to pay for them, upon the
broker should be the discomfort. He can better af
ford to wait than can the teacher, and if not willing
to take the chance of waiting has no business to :
enter upon the contract. If he buy a November
salary, and there happen to be no November salary,
the fault not resting with the teacher, the loaner has
no moral right to take the salary of a succeeding
â  month. The trouble is. however, that these note
shavers do as they please, and do hot care whether it
â *.t or not.
There is no occasion for surprise that the Chinese
are slaying the missionaries. It must be remembered
that these good "men and women arc representatives
of the godly nations which are even now scheming
to steal China, and discussing the project with all the
candor of a band of burglars.

- THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THUBSPAY, FEBRUARY 16, 1899,
STATE ECONOMY.

np.HE .people* of this State expect the Legislature
- " to zealously of this State expect the Legislature
to zealously second the economical policy of the
''}â  ***- Governor for the coming biennium. No doubt
is felt of his 'absolute 'â  integrity of intention to that
end, and there is already evidence that he will use his
veto to enforce it. 3-
The demands by many State institutions for new build
ings and. betterments need a searching examination.
In many instances it seems quite unlikely that impera
tive necessity, has arisen since the last Legislature
adjourned. There is needed for each reform school,
especially, a â¢ painstaking management, capable of
finding out the numerous instances in which parents
willfully shift, their parental responsibility upon
the "State and -needlessly put off their
n&tural obligation : for the care and discip
line of their children. In too many instances
reform of vicious . parents is needed more than re
form of their unfortunate children. In the insane
asylums is a . great field for reform. In them the
State is burdened with obligations which by nature
belong to individuals who conceal their capacity to
discharge them.
California has an extensive and costly equipment of
eleemosynary institutions, and we are within the facts j
when we say that not only other States but foreign J
countries take advantage of the kindness of this State
to the defective classes by the deliberate expatriation
of their own citizens of these classes to this State to
become the objects of its care" and increase the bur
dens of its taxpayers.
.3 A business Governor, if he can take the time and
can go, like Harou'n Al Raschid/appearing unex
pectedly and investigating quietly, can find out much
in the interest of economy in our public institutions.
This involves no charge of extravagance against
their local boards of control, because, as a fact -of
record, our incorrigible, penal and defective classes
in these institutions have long been maintained at a
cheaper rate per capita than in similar institutions in
representative Eastern States. The extravagance is
tt be sought in the number cared for by the public/
who should be charged to individuals, relatives, who
are abundantly able to observe in that respect their
natural obligations, and in the useless expense put
into buildings and the enlargement of quarters in the
expectation of a future demand for their use. The 'â 
State is in ; thorough sympathy with the Governors ;
! inaugural declarations in these matters, and the Ways
and Means Committee of the House and the Finance
'. Committee of 3 the Senate should scan carefully
every demand.
- It is unfortunate that; the management of our State.
institutions*- being. largely partisan, a newly inaugur
ated Governor begins his administration with 3 di
rectors and trustees of public institutions opposed to
him in. politics; When 'these officers, without visibly
good ..reasons,, call for a scale of appropriations and
expenditures from which they refrained under the ad- [
ministration of their own party, it is quite worth
while to inquire searchingly into the justifying cir- j
cumstances. -The. intricate relation of politics to the
whole question is unfortunate. In a Republican j
county, with Senators and Representatives of that
party in the Legislature, may be public institutions
at this moment under Democratic boards of control
asking large appropriations. It is only natural that
the members strive to get them passed, lest the peo
ple at home accuse them of neglecting local interests. j
The system makes against economy, and it is highly
probable that the Governor, who represents the whole j
State and no one locality, will have to bear the re- j
sponsibility of drastic enforcement of economy, and j
therein he will certainly require public support and
should receive popular approbation.
It is noticeable that already many propositions are
made for the establishment of new commissions for
various purposes, principally necessary and praise
worthy, and that they are to serve without salary or
expense to the State. This is a distinct innovation,
but even it requires to be guarded. Out of every
such commission may in. the future grow a salaried
and expensive establishment. Therefore care should :
be taken that the organic act creating it states speci
fically its duties and limits and terminates the time for
their execution, and then repeals itself by providing
that the position or office shall cease, end and have :
no further existence.
THE WAR COMMISSION, REPORT.
OF the report made by the War' Commission to
the President it may be said it is so dis
appointing in its nature that few people will be
willing to accept.it as the final word on the'subject.'
It is long without .being comprehensive, full of detail
without being definite and critical without being con
clusive. ' â¢
On the subject of the controversy between General ;
Miles and the Commissary Department, concerning
the nature of the meat supplies of the army, the re
port is particularly weak, and yet it is upon that point j
the people were most' eager for a complete and au- !
thoritative decision. From the summary of the re
port that has been given to the press it would appear
the commission regarded the issue as a minor one in
the conduct of the war, instead of being one of the
most serious with which it had to deal.
General Miles testified that much of the beef fur- j
nished the army was preserved with chemicals; that it !
v. as virtually embalmed beef; that some of it was
covered with a green mold; that the odor was four
and that the troops could not eat it. The testimony
ci the general was confirmed by reports of many of
the army inspectors and regimental officers. It
showed a vile conspiracy on the part of the contrac
.tors to enrich themselves by supplying the army not
with the good beef for which the Government paid,
but with stuff so foul it . was almost poisonous to j
those who fed upon it. J.
The publication of this evidence roused the people
tc a glow of indignation which was increased when
Eagan replied to the charges' of Miles with that out
burst of blackguardism which has led to his forced
retirement from the army. With so much public
feeling displayed in the matter we had a right to ex
pect of the commission an exhaustive review of the
subject with recommendations that would lead to the
punishment of the guilty parties; for surely some- j
body is guilty: either the contractors have defrauded
the' Government and endangered the lives of the
troops or Miles and his officers are as many kinds of '
liars as 3Eagan said they were. -.
Yet on this subject the commission contents itseif !
with censuring General Miles for not reporting the I
matter earlier and declaring the neglect on his part
was a "dereliction of duty." . It places the same con- ;
demnation upon Dr. W. H. Daly, major and chief
.surgeon of United States Volunteers, whose reports
agree with the. testimony of Miles as to the nature of
the beef. .3 Â° *" â¢ 3
Upon the main issue the report says the commis
sion obtained a number of samples of canned and of
refrigerated beef and had them examined 3 by*, the
Agricultural Department and they were found to be
free from chemicals. It adds: o ;
"The- unanimous report shows that a number of
officers testified that canned beef was unpalatable.
| It is also elicited that in a tropical country, where
it is -subjected to intense heat, the meat presents a
repulsive appearance at first. Furthermore, it tran
spires that occasionally an inferior article is found.
But the records of the army prove that canned beef
has been used for many years." ..
It is not likely that the controversy can be closed
with such a report as that. It has never been charged
that all the canned meat was bad or that all the fresh
beef was embalmed. The country expects an inves
tigation of the specific charges made by General Miles
and not a vague review of this kind. For that reason,
therefore, the report of the commission will not be
accepted as final. The issue remains open.
THE STATE AND THE EXPOSITION
PUBLIC opinion throughout the State is
strongly in favor of the proposed Pacific Expo
- sition. That much is made certain by the in
terviews with officials and leading people in various
cities published in The Call of yesterday and. to-day,
and the natural inference is that -when the movement
has become better understood the sentiment in its
favor will be almost universal.
Our reports came from Woodland, Oakland, Sac
ramento, Stockton, San Rafael,. Healdsburg,- Santa
Rosa, Bakersfield, San Jose, Suisun, Salinas, Napa,
Hanford, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino
and other important points, and from all these
places, with but few . exceptions, the prevailing
opinion of the people was shown to be one of strong
approval of the enterprise. Indeed in most places the
sentiment in favor of. the project might be fairly de
scribed as enthusiastic, so cordially did the progres
sive citizens indorse the undertaking.
That there would be some opposition to the expo
sition was of course foreseen: No matter what move
ment of a public nature: is projected there are al
ways persons who think some other movement would
be better, or that the. particular project would- be
good enough provided it were postponed for a year
or two.; 3 Such Opposition â ', has to be met and over
come in every new enterprise, and it is gratifying that
in this instance it has been found to be of compara
tively small 'proportions. 3 . â¢>~
There are many reasons why the State at large
should be eager to provide for the proposed expo
sition. California has reached the point in her de
velopment where there is required a diversification of
her industries and a new market for the products of
existing industries. We need an infusion of capital
into manufacturing plants and a large expansion of
commerce, and the attainment of both will be aided
by the proposed: exposition, which will attract the at
tention of the world to the advantages of San Fran
cisco as a commercial metropolis and to the thousand
opportunities offered in all parts of California for
industrial investments.
The strange objection has been made in some
quarters that the exposition .would not be profitable.
It is difficult to understand from what, source such
an idea has been derived. There have been many ex
positions in the United States, and the results have
invariably been of a nature to encourage others.
Thus within the last few years the exposition in At
lanta was so successful that Nashville was induced
to undertake one, and that in turn yielded such good
results that Omaha followed the example/and now,
stimulated by the accomplishments of that city, no
less than five other American comriiunities, not
counting San Francisco, are engaged *in making
preparations for expositions in the near future.
Experience is the best teacher, and the practical
common sense of the American people knows how to
profit by its lessons'. To assert that expositions are
not profitable to the cities where they arc held and
to wide districts of country round about is equivalent
to asserting that the business men of the East are
fools. They have tried expositions, and it is in the
light of an ample experience they are now preparing
more of them. . .
The Atlanta Exposition benefited not only that
city, but the entire South/and it was the conscious
ness of the fact that led the Tennesseeans to follow it
with another at Nashville. The results of the two
were that Northern capital has been turned in a
; steady stream to the South, and manufacturing plants
i of all kinds are being put up throughout the Southern
States with extraordinary rapidity.
California needs the exposition, and the sooner she
can open it the better. The tide of commercial ec
tivity is now flowing strongly toward the Pacific
Ocean, and if we are' wise we will hasten to profit by
the stream.
REFORM THE POUND.
THE other day Acting -Police Judge Barry is
sued warrants for the arrest of three deputy
poundkeepers on a charge of stealing a horse
from John Brennan, who resides at 2622 Gough J
street. Brennan's story is that the deputies broke into
an inclosed lot at the corner of Green and Gough
streets and deliberately drove his horse out into the
street. When he protested against the outrage the
deputies gathered around him and threatened to give
him a good licking if he did not immediately go
about his business. - r
Reference is made to this matter at the present time
for the purpose of colling attention once more to the
necessity of reforming the public pound. The late
Board of Supervisors took the institution away from j
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals â 
and placed it in charge of a politician. In spite of j
the numerous charges and complaints presented to j
them these Supervisors refused to restore the pound j
to its original managers. In other words, they con
sidered politics as paramount to the public interest,
and they turned a deaf ear to all exhortations by
press and people. , .
The lawlessness to which we now call attention may
very properly be considered by the present Board of
Supervisors, the members of which are showing
many signs of a desire to improve municipal condi
tions. We know of no department of the govern
ment in which the board could strike a more effective
blow for reform than in the department of the public 1
pound. What should be done is to . dismiss the
poundkeeper and restore the institution to the con
trol of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. Whether, this is done or not, the pound
should be taken out of politics.
â¢Impounding estray animals is not an agreeable
business, but there are men who will undertake it and 1
manifest some regard for the interests and feelings of
the people. - At " all events*, it is unnecessary for the
poundkeeper to employ hoodlums and lawbreakers.
Throughout the long period during which the pound
was in charge of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals no scandals appeared in connec
tion with it. Since it has become a political attach
ment, however, the Police Court is constantly oc
cupied with complaints against its managers.
. An interesting feature of the story that Gomez has
offered his sword to Porto Rico is the nerve of the
person promulgating it. Porto Rico is not in need

HE WAS DEAD,
BUT IS VERY
MUCH ALIVE
Strange Tale From
Alaska Wilds.
THE WRONG SAM ROBERTS
MRS. GEER LEARNS THAT HER
BROTHER WAS NOT SLAIN.
Three Men Are Now in San Quentin
for Robbing and Killing a
Man Who Is Really at
Skaguay.
;â â 'â¢.â¢ 3V With love to mother and your
self, I remain, your brother, who is very
much alive. . . SAM ROBERTS."
The letter of which the foregoing is the
conclusion brought joy to a family in this
city, for the writer had long been given
up as lostâ foully murdered for his gold
in the wilds of Alaska. Several years ago
Sam Roberts, son of Mrs. L. A.. Roberts
and brother of Mrs. Addle Geer of 1425
Golden Gate avenue, went out into the j
world to seek his fortune. He engaged in
the cattle and land business in Arizona;
but the Mexican cattle thieves drove off
his herds and the price of land 'fell. Next
heard of him, he was with relatives in the
State of Washington, and last came the
information that the glitter of gold in the
new fields of Alaska had turned his foot"
--steps to the frozen north. ." ' ;
The next Information of the wanderer
was a severe shock to the family. The
daily papers told a tale of how Sam Rob
erts was murdered for his gold in a lonely
cabin on the Dyea trail. The story "was
that the unfortunate man had cleaned up
about $32,000 in gold from his claims and
was last seen alive in the company of
three well-known desperate charactersâ
Fitzpatrick, Brooks and Corbett by name.
The next the. body was found murdered
In the cabin and all of the money gone.
A crowd of the rough but honest miners
of the north made search and found the
men suspected of having committed the '
crime. But for the strenuous efforts of
the law and order committee the three
would have been hanged to the nearest j
tree on the trail. The Alaska court was
not slow, and the circumstantial evidence
was so .strong against them that impris- |
onment was the verdict.
For Fitzpatrick the judgment was life |
imprisonment, he being considered to be
the most guilty of the trio. Brooks and
Corbett were sentenced for ten years :
each. There being no State prisons in
Alaska, the three convicts were sent to
California, and after nearly escaping from
the deputies in charge were landed in San
Quentin. Mrs. Geer communicated with |
the authorities in Alaska and described
her brother, even to the mole on the right j
side of his nose. The answer dashed all I
hope to the ground, for the description
of the murdered man corresponded to a
dot with that of the long absent brother,
and the mother, daughter and younger [
children mourned him as lost. One day â 
they received a strange visitor. She in- I
troduced herself as Mrs. Dlckerson of I
Alameda, sister of Fitzpatrick ln San
Qjientln. She said that she had talked
with her brother in the prison and was ;
sure that he never killed Sam Roberts in |
Alaska.
Mrs. Dickinson asserted that the three
convicted men were victims of circum
stances and the fury of an unreasonable
mob of gold hunters who were deter
mined to have blood for blood, and that
the unfortunate Sam Roberts had been
killed by some one else. Mrs. Dicker
son . evidently was looking toward the
time when the crime would pass from
the minds of the public and when a par
don might be obtained for her brother.
Without any opposition from the family
of the murdered man the task would be
much easier.
Several * months ago by chance Mrs.
Geer happened to hear .of a man named
Roberts who was interested in a news
paper in who was and although she be
ier ln Skaguay, and although she be
lieved that her brother was dead and bu
ried, she wrote to the Roberts of the
Skaguay paper. Yesterday mother and
children received a surprise that nearly
took away their senses, for when the
postman handed them a letter the ad
dress as in a handwriting too well
known to be mistaken. The chirography
of the supposed murdered man was al
most Identical with that of his father,
the late Judge Roberts of this city.
It was from Sam Roberts, not him
whose lonely grave is beside the Dyea
trail and whose identity may never be
known, but from the son and brother
mourned as dead. The writer saiH that
he knew of "the other Sam Roberts" and
of his tragic end, but never thought that
any attention would be paid to it here, j
because so many poor fellows have met j
with similar fates in Alaska, of which
the outside world knows nothing. Rob- .
crts gave the cheering Information that
he Is in excellent health, owns a part in- i
terest in a daily ' newspaper tn Skaguav |
and owns several .Timing claims,, besides
being "very much alive.'' The other fea
tures deal with family affairs and con
cludes in the language already quoted, i

QUALIFICATIONS
OF HORSESHOERS
Editor of The Call: There appeared in
your valuable paper of February 9 an ar
ticle under the head of "Paternalism Gone
Mad." If you will kindly grant space for
a reply I will endeavor to cast some light
on the subject. You claim to never before
i have heard of a State establishing a
I board to pass upon the qualifications of
I horseshoers. and you venture to say that
i the annals of legislation will, be searched
|in vain for an instance in which a
! State has actually Interfered with the
feet of its beasts of burden. Now, let us
look at the facts in the case. In 1895,
when the first measure to regulate the
practice of horseshoeing .was introduced
into the Legislatures of Illinois and New
York some people were wont to take n
surprise at tho suggestion that.horse
sheers would demand the passage of such
a law as they had proposed. Little by
little the reasonableness of the proposi
tion became apparent, and when it. was
shown that in the almost unknown prov
inces of Western Europe similar laws to
those we were seeking were in force, and
that, after all, it was but a measure of
j an educational character that we sought, j
i opposition faded away and the open-eyed
legislators acquiesced in many instances
to the wishes of the craft as well as to.
those of a horse-loving community, whose
support of the proposed law was strong
and earnest. " 'â¢ . '
Legislation for horseshoers may still be
said to be in its infancy, but it is a
healthy infant, and its kind throughout
the v States and Canada is being willingly
I fostered. This is solely due to the Master
j Horseshoers' National Protective Associa
tion, whose indefatigable workers for the
betterment of the craft were instrumental
in pushing legislation that was of a ben
eficial as well as of. a protective nature.
Once being recognized, it was seized upon
by all associations interested. Now we
have enacted laws in the States of New-
York, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois and
Maryland. ' . ;â ?*?â -.â 
Word comes from many sources that
bills are framed for a number of States
which will be enacted into laws ere the
Ist of March; 1899. That legislation is
necessary for the craft and the public is
apparent. The horseshoer wants. pay for
his work and the public wants a man
to do its work who knows the mechanism
and construction of the animal to be shod
and who has the" ability to do the work
right. The restrictive laws cover, all this
and should be enacted where, a spark 'of
humanity lurks in the breast of horse
owners and members of the craft. With
general all-round assistance the work can
be crowned with success.
In the cities in recent years
roads are paved with all kinds of
indestructible material, while in the
country roads are graveled and
macadamized. This tests the work
manship and skill of the horseshoer more
than wnen dirt roads were all a horse
foot had to contend with. One realizes
at a glance that this state of affairs de
mands more skill than when a flat shoe
met all the requirements. Now a horse
shoer must know not only that a shoe
fits, but must know the kind of shoe that
will do the work to be performed over the
roads to be traveled, and whether the
conformation of .the animal is such that
such a shoe will cripple or malm it. This
requires thought and study T a knowledge
not only of the horseshoer trade, but
also of the anatomy of the- animal to be
shod. The restrictive laws passed^ in the
various States are for the purpose of com
pelling all horseshoers to be up to the
standard before they can obtain admis
sion to a city or village and Entice. Such
is the best legislation ever effected for the
owners of horseflesh. . \.;3â,^_
If I may be pardoned for prophesying
in conclusion that the time iÂ«Â» not far dis
tant when the owner of a horse or mule
will not ask a shoer whether he can shoe
the animal. He will demand of him. Are
you a member of the Master worse
sheers' National Protective Association?
And is the restrictive law in force in jour
State' This will be the countersign and
password to all as . â  it will be \nown
throughout our ' broad land that any one
who can answer in the affirmative Is a
workman who has knowledge Â£" trnst
combined and is honest and to be trust-

AN APPEAL TO THE SUPREME
COURT INVOLVING MUCH.
Yesterday's Argument in the Case
of Fox vs. Mackay, Jones
and Flood.
The argument on appeal from the judg
ment rendered' by Judge Seawell in the
Superior Court of this city in the case of
Theodore Fox vs. John W. Mackay, Sen
ator John P. Jones and the Comstock
Mining Company was had yesterday in
Department 2 of the Supreme Court. H.
G. Sieberst and S. H. Regensburger ap
peared for the plaintiff, while .the de
fendants' interests were looked after by
W. E. F. Deal and Edmund. Tauszky.
The case, which involves several mil
lions of dollars, presents many â  of -.lie
features of the celebrated Hale & Is 01
--cross suit. Flood. Mackay and Jones
constituted the milling company which
secured the contract to mill the ore from
the Consolidated California and "Virginia
Mining Company, of which company Fox
is a stockholder. - * - . .'-':
Mackay was also a stockholder in the
mining company, in which concern he
owned the controlling interest. Fox. the
plaintiff, alleged that the mining companj
was. through a conspiracy, controlled b.
Mackav. Flood and Jones, charged an ex
orbitant price by the milling company for
its service and that the conspiracy was
made possible and the extortion allowed
through the influence of Mackay, who
controlled the mining company, while
being part owner in the mill. tie
therefore brought suit to compel Mac
kay Jones, Flood and- the mill company
to account for moneys received and to
make restitution of all gains resulting
from the alleged fraud. " a â a â ra n
The case was heard by Judge Seawell
in the Superior Court, and on ' December
6, 1895. a judgment was rendered by him
in favor of the defendant, he holding that
as for over three years all the stockhold
ers of the mining company had full
knowledge of the contract* with the mill
company, and as they acquiesced in all
the material points it contained they by
such acquiescence ratified them and lost
by their laches the right to demand it be
set aside.

Tucked away in one stall of the Corri

horseflesh as has been sprung this year

lap for oyer a furlong." to let St. An

mond took third money. Yellow Tail, the
crack of the Burns & Watershduse string,
could most likely give the son of Golden
Garter and Lucille Murphy an argument, .
but he certainly holds all others safe thus
far shown. At his maiden essay he won
hands down at odds of 10 to 1, and yes
terday showed himself capable of giving
the track record of 0:4S& for four furlongs
a hard rub. ,
The day's sport was marked by some
very* exciting finishes, in nearly every in
stance the winner being returned only in
a hard drive. Favorites again just man
aged to hold their own, by taking three of
the events decided. Bullman piloted two
winners.
The mile handicap was a very tasty rac
ing morsel, the weights being nicely ad
justed. With his 112 pounds up the crowd
went with Satsuma. the bald-faced horse
closing an even money choice. David
Tenny. Adolph Spreckels . and Morelllto
were all overlooked in the rush to get
aboard Dr. Howell's horse. There was
no "pace set the first part, and contrary
to orders, Cash Sloan, on the favorite,
went to the front. In the run home
"Skeets" Martin, astride David Tenny,
challenged the leader and in a long, hard *
drive gained the decision by a scant head I
in 1:42:-..
Primrose was made favorite for the
opening six furlong run, but warmed up I
lame and ran unplaced. He also received
a very poor ride at Frawley's hands. Se
voy. a 20 to 1 shot, piloted by Hahn, was
in front from the start, winning hands
down from Socialist. Carrie U, a 100 to 1
shot, finished in the show.

after a severe Illness, had the pleasure of
seeing his gelding. Our Climate, win the
mile and a sixteenth event. The St. Car

he took a long rest during the day and his
competitors piled up miles behind them
during his absence, leaving the "old
man" in the ruck. He remounted pluckily
late in the afternoon, however, and
started on another long grind. Pierce,
who was the leader Tuesday, also took a
good rest, but it cost him . the lead and
he will have a hard time making it up.
Louis Gimm, a German-American, led
the bunch up to a late hour last night,
smashng record after record as he passed
the mile posts. Up to the forty-seventh
hour Gimm had rested but one hour, had
not slept at all in that time and was over
fifty-seven miles ahead of the previous
record. . _
Miller has rested 109 minutes. Barnaby
154, Frederick 194, Nawn 169, Pierce 156,
Hale 89. None of these men have as yet
had any sleep, and their only nutriment
has been liquid foods and fruit. â¢
Beyond the fatigue incident to the long
ride, the greatest foe the men have to
combat is sleep, and many are the ways
in which they right off drowsiness. While
the pace is slow and steady they are like
ly to dose, but they awaken quickly
enough when a sprint comes and some one
is trying to steal a lap. During the day
time and the early hours of the morning
when most people are peacefully reposing
on their downy couches, it is hardest for
them to keep awake. Then it. is .that the
trainers take a hand and by yells of en
couragement or threats of punishment
urge them on to greater efforts. One of
the best methods in doing: this has been
found to be of yelling out to a man the
amount of the purse he .is riding for..
$1500. :* When he gets thinking Of that all
thoughts of sleep or rest leave his mind
for the time being arid he is .good for an
other ten miles
But the hardest part of the race is yet
to come. The trainers. say that all the
.men now on. the track are comparatively
fresh; -that few hours' sleep would bring
them all out as chipper as a sparrow.
Only a third of the journey, .two days, has
so far been covcrMi * however. Wait un
til they have been. four days, : five days, six
days on. their dreary way arid things will
be different. Then they will hardly, have
strength left to stay oil their wheels, let
alone make up lost ground, and the gait
the men are now maintaining, averaging
twenty h.ik-s an hour, will be decreased
somewhat. It seems a cruel test, and yet
the crowds stay around the track until
the small hours of the morning and come
early in the day to watch the ceaseless
grind. It is said that people do not
watch a balloon ascension and parachute
drop, for the sake of it, but in the expecta
tion that the man may fall, and this seems
to apply aptly to the six-day race.
In the short distance events during the
evening the feature was the breaking of
a world's record by Champion Harry
Elkes, who rode two " miles paced in
3:53 2-5, lowering the best previous record
for an indoor track fully a second. .Elkes I
has grown into great popularity with the I
spectators, and his nightly record-break
ing contests are awaited with breathless i
interest.
The match race on, tandems between I
Hardy Downing and Frank Cotter of Cal
ifornia and Jay Eaton and Teddy Good
man of New York resulted in a victory for
the California team in two straight heats,
the first in 2:07 and the second in 1:59 3-5.
In both starts the Californians won the
toss for position, taking the inside. They
won by a big margin the first time, but
were hard pressed and "all out" the sec
ond, barely crossing the tape in the lead. ;
Notes of the Meet.
Harry Elkes' two mile paced exhibition
ride, in which he broke the world's in
door record, was the prettiest paced ex
hibition yet seen on the track. He was
carried the distance by two tandems, and
the fact that one of the pick-ups was poor
lends added interest to the time, which
would doubtless have been about three
seconds faster had the* exchange been
quickly made.
Edwin E. Stoddard, the famous timer,
and one-time holder of the coast ten-mile
road record, arrived from the south yes
terday morning and assumed his official
position in the evening.
Jimmy Michael's mile exhibition ride,
paced by Fournier, was the slowest he
has yet done here, the time being 2:03.
This is attributed to the fact that he had
to ride wide all the time, thus covering
somewhat more than the actual mile, as
the track is eight laps to the mile, meas
ured on the Inside.
Fournier, on his "infernal machine,"
rode a mile exhibition in 1:57. and the
champion sprinter, Eddie Bald, rode a
half.mile in 58 seconds.
During the afternoon the trainer of
Teddy Hale in the six-day race, ran
alongside of his man as he passed and
yelled: "Good boy, Teddy; keep it up;
you're doing fine. I think Gimm is get
ting cerebro-spinal meningitis." The next
time Teddy came around he yelled back:
"Get me some, too."
To-day's programme of short events is
as follows: Afternoon, at 2:20, unlimited
pursuit race between Frank Waller and
John Chapman; exhibitions by Michael,
Bald, Fournier and Elkes. Evening, at
9 o'clock, tandem pursuit race between
Waller and Stevens, Eaton and Goodman,
Chapman and Lawsori, Turvllle brothers,
Gibson and LeonaTt, besides the usual
exhibitions.
Frank Waller has recovered the use of
his eyesight, which he lost entirely after
riding twenty hours in the six-day race,
and will ride against Chapman this after
noon.
The betting on the six day last night
j was as follows: Gimm and Miller, 6 to 5;
Frederick, Barnaby and Pierce, 8 to 1;
Nawn, 10; -Hale, 15; Alberts, 30; Lawson
and Julius, 200 to 1; Ashinger, 200; Pilk
ington, 100. This shows that the odds have
lengthened on all except Gimm, who' was
3 to li If he continues in the lead another
day his odds will shorten even more.
"Pop" Elkes, father of Harry Elkes,
the American wonder at middle distance
racing, and also his. manager, Is a true
sport. Speaking of his boy last night, he
.said: "I want the people here to see
Harry in a race instead of exhibitions,
and am willing to make almost any rea
sonable match, providing it is at our dis
tanceâfrom twenty to thirty-three miles
paced by as many machines as we like.
He will take on four of the California
boys, say Downing, Cotter, McFarland
and any other, they to relay each other
as they please, Harry to ride the entire
distance; or he -will take on any one of
them and give him a handicap of a quar
ter of a mile in every ten."
" The management is anxious to make the
match' so if the local men are willing it
will probably come off. .

NEW YORK. Feb. 15.â Many stocks were ma
terially advanced on the Stock- Exc'ange to-day,
with dealinsrs considerably -larger, than yes
terday. Generally the early market was more
animated than of late and strength developed |

point London was selling, enormous blocks of
stocks were absorbed, although the price hung
for a long time at 53%. The advance In this
stock progressed .in spite of the dissemination
of a report that the officials of the company de- '
nied that the preferred stock would- be retired :
or that such a project had been considered. j
As Northrn Pacitic common was the feature
of strength, so was Burlington prominently.

It left oft with a net decline of two points.
The weakness of Burlington had- but little ef- |

more or less strength at intervals. Northern. ;

New Yorw Air Brake, which had been rather
neglected of late, made a sensational advance
of 10%: During the afternoon there were nu
merous sharp recessions, nut prices picked up
and continued to improve to the close, the

Cotton Reporter will ftay to-morrow: There is
a good volume of business to report for the
past week, notwithstanding the cold * and.
stormy weather, * which practically ' brought

Manufacturers are petting some orders for
goods and there is a little more inquiry.' for
wool. * Orders for goods for the most part,* how
ver, have been small, the clothing trade buy
ing with great conservatism, so that thus far
the result of the heavy-weight season has been
a disappointment with most. of the mills. â 
The sales of the week in Boston amounted to
3,087.000 pounds domestic and 1.280,500 foreign, a

The Southern* Pacific Company's freight
-teamer Transit met with a peculiar ac- i
:ident yesterday. She hung herself up on ;
the end of the Mail- Company's wharf. ;
0 wit as luck would have it very little dam
age was done toXhe vessel and she will I
be running again to-day on her regular i
*oute as though nothing had happened:
The Transit left the railway freight ]
â lip in Oakland Creek shortly after
> a. m. She had nineteen carloads of \
sheep and bullocks besides some general
merchandise aboard, so she was well |
oaded down. All went well until the San [
Francisco side of the bay was reached.
Then the fog and the ebb tide got in their '
York., Captain Anderson thought he was.
â¢lose to his slip and stopped he engines.
While trying to ascertain his position the
tide carried the big freight boat down
>n the Mall Company's wharf. Before,
talf the- crew knew what had happened
he vessel's guard was over the end of
he wharf and the vessel was hard and
â¢ast. "-'*-] : ;3 -' :.-**â¢â¢:. : v
Captain Anderson made an examination
md found that his vessel was in a most {
iwkward predicament. She was jammed I
10 close to the wharf that .the paddle :
â â 'heels could not be used and.when the
Hail Company's tug Milieu * Griffith was '
>ressed into service she was unable to
>u_ge the big freighter. â¢'. * 3 j
This happened about 6a. m. and. the f
Transit had to remain hung up on the :
vharf until 3 p. m.. when she was got j
iff at high water. When she went on the
'"de had run about half out, so for an- :
other three hours her port side kept go
ng lower and lower, until the. deck was
Ike an inclined plane and the : deckload
vas kept from going, overboard by ropes.
* hen the back wash from a passing
iteamer came along the Transit's beams I
you d creak and groan and at one time
t^was feared that sjTe would break In ;
wo.
Along about 9 a- m . the tide began ." to
food, out it was two hours later before :
t began to make any showing on the *
erry. boat. About noon she was resting I
n an easier position and from that time
'2.-I she gradually got on an: even keel J
md at 3 p. m.* she was towed off. Her I
n y damage was the loss of a few standi
hions under the guard, while the wharf
ost. a few stringers and fender piles.

og* he was not certain of his position, I
.nd knowing, that be had. run 3 his dis
ance stopped, the vessel in order to find

ast Sunday. Men and women fought '
vith each other to get a place on the .
â¢ aunches and fought again when it came
o getting aboard the warship. All who ;

â  They were given the precedence over the

Victor Genereaux the hero. of the Kenil

bis oldish? friends yesterday. ; .
It will he remembered that the Ameri

New York On July' *..s'. the cargo was
found to be on fire, and that, night: Cap

When the. â¢ nil wort h. finally : reached
New York Gener.auX was given a 'holiday.
and was told by Captain Taylor the new
master 3 that on his .return.'' he would sail
as chief officer. As he had saved the ship
and crew from destruction and later, by
his cleverness, got the vessel towed into
port for a -song when it might have; tost
$10,. 00*, the : promotion': was ..'ell -deserved,,

â¢ 908 Broadway, Feb. 15.
The special meeting of the Contra Costa
Water Company's shareholders will be
held to-morrow and the consolidation
with the Oaklandâ or Dingeeâ company
will be closed. All the facts in the case
were exclusively presented In The Call
several weeks ago. The Contra Costa
directors controlled by Henry Pierce alone
opposed the scheme, and to-morrow they
will be instructed by the shareholders to
close the deal.
It is now figured out that W. J. lMngeel
and Alvinza Hayward have cleared
nearly a million apiece by their venture.
The general estimate of the amount of
actual investment in the Oakland com
pany is from $1,-00,000 to $1,700,000. As
there is no means by which the details
of the investment can be secured, the
estimate is based on testimony given by
Mr. Dlngee before the committee of the
City Council last year. Should the Con
tra Costa stock issued to Dingee and
Hayward came to par it would represent
over a million and a half of profit. At
present a $100 share of stock is worth $67,
and is increasing on the market. |
In this particular speculation Hayward
has played in-rare luck, and but for the
two dry years the' consolidation would not
have been effected.. The extreme drought
of last year made such, drafts on the
catchment:- supply* of . the Contra Costa
company that it was in no condition to
meet a second drought this. year. if from
time to time there is not a good supply of
rain this city will require all the water
from the Alameda wells to supplement
the supply of the old company.
At the time when Mr. Dingee had 'de
veloped th. Piedmont water supply and
was ius't contemplating the Alvarado en
terprise- there' were v negotiations to sell to
the Contra Costa Water ; Company.: .-The
price set- is said to have, been $250,000, and
the Contra Costa people .- regarded this
as excesive, though compared with : their
estimated loss ,â :' $2,000,000. the -opportunity ;
to buy. out ; a dangerous rival- offered itself
very -Cheap. It is also stated that the
Contra Costs Company had at one time
considered a proposition to buy the Alva- j
rado wells before Mr Dingee turned, ins
attention" to 'them; The price at that timet
was '4-5-,-OOQ, and. It is clear that it would .
have been an advantageous -buy-;
The* combination of the two companies
may have a material effect on the water |
rates to be fixed by the Council.

PREPARING FOR

> Brandes Not Feeling
at Ease. '
JURORS ARE INQUISITIVE
LILLIAN'S FATHER'S THREATS
TO TAKE HER LIFE.
i . â¢ â 
Several Witnesses Testify to His
Hatred for His Daughter.
Doctors Will Quiz Each
Other in Court.
. .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Feb. 15.
Brandes' possibility of conviction of the
I murder of his daughter was strength
ened to-day when Mrs. Mary Gamboa of
1 Santa Cruz testified that she had heard
! the prisoner threaten to take the life of
his daughter if she did not do as he
wished. Mrs. Gamboa testified that her
1 conversation with Brandes occurred about ;
; two years ago and that she remembered
! It as soon as she heard of Lillian's death.
Ramon Arana, another witness from j
; Santa Cruz, also heard Brandes say that ,
' unless his girl behaved herself he would j
| kill her. - 3.: -.3 ; *
Everybody is waiting for the battle on j
' the skull. "It is expected that this will
i be one of the bitterest scientific fights ever
seen in the Alameda courts. A dozen
physicians have been subpenaed to give
expert testimony and they will be dl- !
. vided into factions. Dr. Buteau will j
handle the medical testimony for the
prosecution and Dr. Woolsey will attend
to the defense. It was Dr. Woolsey who i
in company with Brandes' attorneys took
the skull from the coffin of Lillian
Brandes while the murdered girl's re- :
i mains were at. the Berkeley Morgue.
The skull will shortly be introduced in ;
evidence and the defense is relying upon |
being able to prove that there were no !
bruises upon the head that could possibly j
have caused death. It is in the custody
of the defense and will be the bone of con- ,
tention over which the medicos will fight j
: and lose their tempers. Drs. Buteau and |
, Woolsey were once friends. Fifteen years j
ago they were not rivals and although |
. they have frequently differed in opinion, !
this case is the first where the two
prominent physicians have had a square
i opportunity to face each other in court
and try to undo each other. .Both men
are experts of long experience and. each
Is well qualified to tackle the delicate con- ;
troversy Involving* the skull of Lillian
Brandes. .. â â 
3 The attorneys for the defendant declare
that the skull is in good care and that it
will be presented in precisely the same
condition as when it was taken from the'
head of. the murdered girl. ; Six doctors I
inspected the skull before it was secured j
I from the coffin, and should any accident,
have happened, to it in the interval, it j
Would be easily detected.
"_' Brandes is not so self-composed as he
was at the. beginning of the trial. He
Is much thinner than at the time of the :
girl's death, .and shows his anxiety. The
jurors do not reassure the prisoner. They |
have -cultivated a habit of asking ques- I
. tions of the witnesses that show how close
: ly they are following the evidence.* Some
of the. questions asked by jurors are sig
-1 nificant of their Ideas, .as for instance
â  when questions were asked with great
, detail: regarding the condition of Lillian's
throat. *
W. J. Richardson, a neighbor of
. Brandes, told of cruel treatment Inflicted:
on * Lillian, * and: of an 3 occasion when
Brandes swore and made threats at his:
daughter. It is not unlikely that the de
fense will put both Brdndes and his wife :
on tin- stand to testify in behalf of the !
! prisoner. '

Mining and Milling Company, five shares
of the Giant Powder Company, 1000 shares
of the Oakland Artificial Stone Company
and other stock and valuable realty.
After certain legacies were distributed
In April, 1891, the remainder of the estate
went to a trust provided for by the will.
From the income of the trust the defend
ant trustees were to pay .to the heirs
monthly allowances ranging from $50 to
$100 each; and after these allowances the
trustees were to divide annually the bal
ance among the heirs, and In the event
of an heir's death the share was to go
to the remaining heirs. The total yearly
Income required to pay said monthly al
lowance is $3300.
The plaintiffs in the suit filed to-day are
as follows: Frank Varney and Thomas
1.. Varney (by their guardian at litem,
John W. Varney), Charles Varney,
George W. Varney, Fred H. Varney, Car
lie Varley- Eastman, Kate D. Green,
George V. Pope, Hannah Edson, Emily
A. V. Brownell, James Gllson Dean, I
Charles H. Stanton, "William J. Stanton j
Jr. and Susie Wells. Joined as defend- |
ants are Mary C. B. Varney, Thomas H.
B. Varney and H. B. Varney, because i
they refuse to join as plaintiffs.
The complaint alleges that the trustees
have never paid any allowance except
that of Emily A. V. Bromwell, and '
that they have managed and used
the funds in their own interests.
The . : trustees . are 3 also charged i
with causing themselves: to be appointed
to offices in corporations wherein the es
tate holds controlling interests; that the
trustees have paid to themselves large
salaries out of the trust estate and as of
ficers of said corporations.
The heirs now ask that the Superior
Court require the trustees to make an ac
counting: that they be compelled to re
turn to the estate all moneys paid .: to
themselves as salaries;: also such salaries
as were received from the corporations;
also that they be compelled-. to pay. over
money that has been idle, with legal in
terest.
[â *. It is alleged that there Is: now in the
i trust, estate $350,000 to which the heirs are
; entitled, and tha $55,500 would be an am
ple fund for the trustees to retain in their
hands and invest for purposes of paying
â the: monthly Incomes to the heirs.-. â¢3*' ; -* l

Agricultural Department, *; U. C, to
Remain at Berkeley.
BERKELEY, Feb. 15.â The professors
and Instructors of the agricultural de
partment, University of California, were
surprised to read in this morning's pa
pers that the Board of Regents had de
cided to move their college from its pres
ent station at Berkeley to the Flood man
sion at Menlo Park. As no previous inti
mation whatever had been given of the
change in contemplation steps were, taken
to have the report confirmed by the sec
retary of. the Board of .Regents. The min
utes of yesterday's meeting were looked
Into, and;, they Showed that the; report
had been unfounded. The mistake arose
from.. the misunderstanding of a motion;
put,: which, instead. of calling for the ac
tual transfer to be made, merely left the
matter in the hands of ay committee to
â¢ take under consideration.
Professor 1-". W. Hilgard. dean of the
College of. Agriculture, .said: this after
noon that the move, if decided upon,
would bring about a radical change in his
department, as it would : make one more
affiliated college for the university. This
could riot be done without the expenditure
of a large sum of money, at the same
time depriving the agricultural students
of the academic work in natural science
Which 3 riecessarilS' .supplements their
course, and : which is only given at the
College of Natural Science in Berkeley.
Professor Hilgard and the corps of In
structors associated with him look unfa
vorably upon the change proposed.

VICTIMS OF MISFORTUNE.
Reasons for the Failure of the Cali
fornia Grocery Company.
The attachment of the California Gro
cery â  Company on Monday by the cred
itors of that concern has caused the pro
moter/ W. F. Connolley. considerable an
noyance, because, the published accounts
of the failure cast discredit upon his in-,
tegrity. The gentleman has been in the
grocery business for many years and has
always been highly esteemed. The com
pany was formed recently, after Mr. Con
nolley had received the. assurance that
the means would be forthcoming to. carry.
it on properly In speaking of the failure
he says:
'At the inception of the enterprise . l hail '. every
assurance of ample capital to carry it to a
successful' issue.* It was simply.- -a. series of
misfortunes.and.dlssppalntmentsvromlng. sim
ultaneously* that made. It impossible to con
tinue business; .As to. the bills which came,
flue f.n the l*Ttt li Inst., (about $''.<Â»'. and. not
$10,000, as stated)*. I had every *-Â«ason to be
lieve, that .we * would be In a jv . tlon to meet
them when due. . _ â¢â¢ â¢>
â¢ I had expected $5000 on Saturday. I. wag also
negotiating with a gentleman who desired to
invest $5000 more,' another gentleman, who warn
already a member of the firm.- was to . add
$5000 on. the first of April. " -This $15,000, togeth
er with the' business of $Co<*oa month, â¢ which
we 'were doing, would - have started us all
right, â¢ in forming the organization I : did so
only.' after/ careful Investigation, :. and. -with
honest belief that I -was doing only what. was
'right, and I am satisfied that an Impartial In
quiry will prove that I have done no wrong.

From statements of the people in* the
locality, the three men were in the habit
of idling much of the time around the
house and in the company of Mrs. Shep

appears that one method of entertaining
the woman was getting drunk and taking
turns: at fighting. According to Mrs.

CARRENO, THE RAO-TIME
MAN AND TWO CRITICS
A small audience, mostly women, at
tended Carreno's farewell recital in. the
Metropolitan Temple Tuesday afternoon.
| But whatever the audience lacked in size
it made up in appreciation. At the close
of the programme Mme. Carreno was re
called again and again. Men cheered and
women shouted "Bravo!" at the tops of.
their voices. A score of corsage bouquets
were thrown to the artist.- â¢ The pro
gramme was a happy blend of Beethoven,
Chopin and Schumann together with a
j group of moderns. Beethoven was repre
sented by the "Appassionata" sonata, and
I that famous work was given a superb
reading under the thrilling fingers of Car-
I reno. 7 'â â  :.'â¢â¢
Several people remained after Carreno's
I concert to hear a new rag-time pianist
discovered by a well-known newspaper
man, and a fierce fight that broke out be
tween Mr. Lucchesi, music critic of the
Wasp, and Mr. Bosworth, who represents
a daily paper in a . like capacity. The
quarrel was the outcome of a recent para
graph of Mr. Bosworth's,* ln which the
sons of Italy were alluded to as Dagos.
Mr. Lucchesi, a torrid Italian, took this
opportunity to call his colleague to ac
count. The weapons were adjectives, and
when the combatants in the bloodless 'at
tle separated each regarded himself at the
victor. The rag-time pianist, who is real
ly a wonder, had hardly commenced play
ing when Mme. Carreno sent a young
woman from her dressing room to request
him. to be silent. ' Sadly the young rag
timer â¢ wandered out into' the world.
. "Well," he said, "maybe Carreno will
want to play on my piano some day."

One Victim Is Rescued From a Brothel on
Brooklyn Alley by Secretary Kane of
the Society for the Suppres
sion of Vice.
. Secretary Frank J. Kane of the Society
for the Suppression of Vice, headed a
raid on the Japanese brothels in Brooklyn
ally last" night In search of evidence
against a gang of slave-dealers and slave
owners who have plied their nefarious,
vocation .in this city with r^narkabjo
success for the last three years. The raid
was a success, although instead of res
cuing three of the enslaved females but
one was taken from the vile den where
she had been confined for six months,
compelled to receive the Chinese patrons
of the place in order that her master
might fill his coffers with the price of her
degradation.
This one will prove a valuable witness
and as a result of her release from dur
ance some sensational developments are
expected within the next few days, im
plicating members of the police force and
a Federal official. The officers were
obliged to drag her from the foul smell
ing den by main force, us, while she was
anxious to be free, she feared the venge
ance of her master and his minions, and
as long as they were by she trembled
with apprehension. After being safely
lodged ln the Presbyterian Mission, how
ever, and assured that the liberty she had
so long prayed for was -hers at last, she
recovered her composure In a measure

was the beginning of a fistic .battle;
resulting in * bloodshed and wounded

There was little time wasted in get
ting down to business. Martin, who is â¢
the proprietor of . a last resort estab
lished on Geary street, bore an an
cient grievance , against Faber and he, ,
deliberately J resolved to wipe lit out by -
wiping the pavements with the latter.
With fire in his eye and unrest in his ,
fists he -sought y Faber. in the place
where he works, the California Under
periority is worse than Imbecile in his
connection with the practice of importing
young girls for the purpose of compelling
them to live a life of shame for the profit
.of* men too lazy to earn an honest living
by the sweat of their, brows. Lees was
informed of the existence of the malodor
ous gang a month ago by Dr. Sturge of
the Presbyterian Mission and Rev. M. C.
Harris of the Methodist Japanese Mission,
who gave him the names of three of the
unfortunates who were being debauched
in the Brooklyn alley dens against their
will.
Instead of taking such action the senile
old chief grinned patronizingly in the
faces of his informants and assured them
that dens of vice were a necessary evil
in San Francisco, even though they were
stocked with young girls whose sobs and
pleas for liberty had aroused a feeling of
pity even in the calloused breasts of the
habitues of the resorts where they were
confined. This head of the Police De
partment of the great city of San Fran
cisco absolutely â¢ refused to exercise his
authority in behalf of these poor unfortu
nates, preferring to allow them to remain
and rot in the vapor of immorality in
which they were forced to live. It was
then that the matter was placed in the
hands of Secretary Kane. Before he
could take action the girls were removed
to other lodgings and it became neces
sary to locate them again. This was ac
complished several days ago and prepar
ations for the raid were at once begun.
At 10 o'clock last night Mr. Kane, ac
companied by Special Officers F. C. 80--
den, J. W. Bird and P. J. Millett, visited
the dens kept by the Suglyama brothers
and a Japanese named Toda, in the three
story brick building at the corner, of Sac
ramento street and the alley and a place
kept' by one Sugiura a few doors away, in
search of the three girls, Chiyo, Klku and
Koysoshi. They found Chiyo in Toda's
place and took her to the Presbyterian
Mission, â  but the other girls * had â  disap
peared. With the aid of Rev. Sugeta and
Mr. Furuga, who acted as interpreter,
the girl told her story.
She' said Toda visited her home in the
taking 'Parlors. â¢ Not. wishing to de
molish the furniture of a rival in busi
ness, Martin ; politely invited Faber' to
step out on the sidewalk. Faber was
agreeable and then was ushered in the
battle of the undertakers.-
The tide of battle favored Under
taker Faber. In a" fierce but short
engagement he carried off the honors
of warfare, the first and only blood
coming from the lips of Mr. .Martin.
The other casualties were visited upon
his 'spectacles, which were triturated
by v the shoes of the two men as they,
sparred for wind. Undertakers poured
in from every : direction, making a
ring for the principals and waiting
with eagerness for the corpse. Once
some one , tried to cut short the argu

northern part of Japan about seven
months ago and requested her parents to
allow her to return to America with him.
He represented that he was well able to
care for her and would send her to school
so she might obtain an education and pre
pare herself for a life of greater ease
than she could possibly hope for if she
remained at home. The prospects ap
pealed to the unsophisticated Japanese
girl and when her parents refused to give
their consent she ran away and joined
Toda. Kiku " and Koyoshi were also
brought over by Toda on this trip, the
consent of their parents having been ob
tained by him by similar representation as
ln the ease of Chiyo. When they reached
this country instead of being given an
opportunity to attend school they were
caged, in a brothel.
Secretary Kane has in his possession
ample evidence to prove the existence of
the gang of Japanese slave owners, and
last night's raid was but the opening
move In the crusade which has been in
augurated under his direction with the ob
ject of suppressing the vice and the pun
ishment of all those concerned in promot
ing and abetting the unlawful practice.
The facts gathered, by Mr. Kane are of a
sensational character and involve, not
only the actual owners of the human
chattels, but others, including at least one
white man, a Government official, whose
duty it is to prevent the landing at this
port of women brought here for immoral
purposes. This Government official is Al
bert H. Geffeney, Deputy United States
Commissioner of Immigration and Japa
nese interpreter.
According to the information in the pos
session of -Mr.*. Kane, Geffeney has been a
silent but active partner in the traffic, and
while he has kept in , the background , so
far as any actual. bargaining for the bod
ies of the unfortunate Japanese girls was j
concerned he has "stood in" on every i
transaction and received his share for
every woman from the land of the Mikado
landed from the steamers that brought
them to these shores. As Deputy Com
missioner of Immigration this was a com
paratively easy task for Geffeney, and as
Japanese Interpreter he was able to pre
vent his superiors and brother officials
from discovering that anything wrong
was going on under their noses. y J .3 . 'â¢.
The active members of the gang are:
T. and K. Yamanaka. Toda, Sugiura, Yo
kota, Klrjma, Fuiyita and Yashu. Mu
rata is the procurer," who is said to have j
brought to this : country, hundreds of
young girls, all of whom, it is alleged, (
have been landed through the accommo- !
dating Mr. Geffeney.
I. Yamanaka, who with his brother runs â 
one of the dens visited by the officers last i
night under the name of Sugiyana, is the
recognized head of the gang and attends
to the bribery, using as a go-between one
Hiraiyumi. Two policemen on whose
beats the dens are located are also said
to have accepted bribes to afford "pro
tection" to the keepers of the vile joints;
Charges will be preferred against Geffe
ney and the policemen and the members
of the gang will also be prosecuted.
