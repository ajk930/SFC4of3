MANILA. March 6. 10:30 a. m.â ln
the last two days there has been a very
noticeable change in Manila for the bet

Numbers of people are seen upon the
streets and the amount of business
transacted in the stores has marvelous

was blocked with carriages for the first
time since the outbreak, and the band

NEEDS SMALL VESSELS
TO CATCH FILIBUSTERS
NEW YORK, March 5.â A "Washing
ton special to the Herald says: The
necessity of suppressing filibustering
itions is the cause of Admiral
Dewey asking that th^ Navy Depart
ment send him more vessels of a light
draught. On account of the number
of the Philippine islands the natives
are able to transport from the Asiatic
coast a large quantity of munitions of
war in small schooners. Admiral Dewey

sposal which can follow such yes r
Eels into shallow water. The Wheel
BUILDINGS BLOWN
DOWN BY TORNADO
Three Persons filled, Many In
jured and a Dozer) Houses
Destroyed.
ATHENS, Term., March 5. â A tornado, about seventy yards wide,
struck a portion of Madisonvllle last night, killing three persons, wound
ing ten or twelve others and completely destroying twelve or fifteen houses
and several barns, The killed are;
MR. AND MRS. JACK M< -SER.
ED. L. HORTON.
Wounded: Miss Willie Ervine, Miss Delia Mason, Mrs. E. L. Hortnn,
Mrs. L. A. Kohinsnn. Mr. L. A. Robinson, Hobert Robinson, Miss Rodg
ers, Mr. Moser, Professor Kdlin. ,
The Horton and Robinson residences are both complete wrecks, not
one timber being 1- ft above another. The escape of the inmates was
miraculous, some of th^m being blown a distance of a hundred yards and
only receiving sliglit biuines.
TV. F. Ervine's residence had one end torn away; Dillon Rodgers*
house is almost wrecked; Erskine Lowry's residence moved the distance
of ten feet and was almost wrenched out of shape. Telephone and tele
graph wires are blown down and all communication shut off.
The storm came up with alarming suddenness and swept everything
in its path. It was accompanied by a terrible roar. Frightened inhabit
ants rushed for their cellars and places of safety. In the country great
damage was done to orchards and crops by the wind and hail that fol
lowed. It is reported that further casualties resulted in outlying rural
districts, but no particulars have been received.
Jack Biose* met a horrible deat.h He was hurled a distance of 700
yards, until hia progress was impeded by a wire fence, which completely
Severed his head from the body. The 12-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs.
Moser escaped.
In addition to the loss of life and destruction of residence property
many barns were swept away and stock killed. The woodworking and
milling plant of J. H. Burleson, containing costly machinery, was dam
aged. Most crt the damaged property Is uninsured.
At upper East Tennessee points heavy rains did untold damage to
crops and it is conservatively estimated that this torrent, coupled with
the recent freeze and bad weather, will mean a loss of $1,000,000 to farmers
In that section.
The San Francisco Call.
ing has already started for Manila and
the Vixen will go by the last of this
month. The department may send
others.
The authorities were glad to hear
that General Law ton would arrive at
Manila about March 10, as he will then
be put in control of military opera
tions, thus giving General Otis an op
portunity to aid the Philippine Commis
sion as well as take care of many ques
tions constantly arising. After General
Lawton"s arrival one of the brigadier
generals at Manila will probably be sent
t<> Iloilo to relieve General Miller, who
will go on the retired list March 27.
OTIS REPORTS ARRIVAL

GIRLS CATCH A BURGLAR
AFTER A LIVELY CHASE
SANTA CRUZ, March 6.â Mis* Ma
mie Mirandl Is the heroine of the
hour In Santa Cruz, and from Bun
up to-day till dark the plucky young
lady has been receiving the congratu
lations of friends and neighbors on "her
remarkable feat of bravery yesterday,
â when she encompassed the capture of
a burglar whom she detected in the act
of robbing the home of A. Jennings,
in the residence portion of the city. It
was an act of daring seldom dupli
cated by one of the fair sex in any city
in any land, and all Santa Cruz is
proud of pretty Miss Mirandi. Three
other young ladies who assisted in the
pursuit and capture of the culprit are
coming in for their share of praise.
They displayed the inherent grit of Cal
ifornia girls, and in a manner not often
equaled for its daring.
The Jennings family was away from
home yesterday. It resides at the cor
ner of Clay street and Broadway. The
Mlrandl homo Is about 100 yards from
that of Jenning-s, with no hou.se be
tween. It was at about 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, and Miss Mirandi was sit
ting by the bedside of a. sick brother.
She chanced to look out of the window
and saw a well dressed man walking
around the Jennings dwelling and look
ing into the windows. A little later
she saw the shadow of a man pass the
window on the Inside of the neighbor's
home.
"There is a burglar in that house,"
said the young lady to her brother.
With gTit and bravery not often dis
played by one of the fair sex. the girl
ran to the Jennings home. The front

CHINA REFUSES TO YIELD
TO THE DEMANDS OF ITALY
PEKING March s.â The Tsung-11-Yamen (Chinese Foreign Office) has
returned to the Italian Charge d'Affaires, Marquis Sal v ago Raggo, his
dispatch containing the demand of the Italian Government for a lease
on Ran Mun Bay, on the same conditions as those under which Ger
many holds Kiaochau Bay, accompanying It wtth a letter declaring that the
Chinese Government is unable to granf the request.
The demand of the Italian Government of a ninety-nine years' lease on
San Mun Bay, province of Che Kang, as a coaling station and naval base,
Included also a demand for the concession of throe islands off the coast of
Che Kang, with the right to construct a railroad from San Mun Bay to Po-
Yang Lake and to preferential and railroad and mining privileges within a
sphere of influence covering the southern two-thirds of Che Rang province.
According to a dispatch to the Associated Press from Peking last Fri
day the action of the Italian Government had caused great excitement
there not only among the Chinese, but also among the foreign diplomats,
the Chinese' being convinced that Great Britain was chiefly responsible for
the demand and that it had been made to emphasize Great Britain's dis
pleasure at the turn which the northern railroad question had taken.
The representative of the great power, according to the same dispatch,
was" reported to have said that the moment had arrived for international
control of China and it was also asserted that if the policy of "spheres of
RIVERS OVERFLOW BANKS.
CHARLESTOWN W. VA. SUBMERGED
CHARLESTOWN, W. Va., March s.â The Kanawha Valley waa visited
to-day by one of the worst floods in local history. After several days
of heavy rainfall the Kanawha Elk River, in an unprecedented short
time, has covered almost the entire valley. Charlestown is almost en
tirely under water, four feet surrounding the State Capitol. The Mayor and
leading citizens have opened a relief station and are distributing provis
ions and clothing among the suffering. Considerable damage has been
caused to the local coal property and a dozen barges swept away. The
Black Cat coal tipple, near the east bank, was destroyed. To-night the
water works, both gas plants and the electric light works are shut down
and the city is in darkness. Hundreds of families are quartered in the Capi
tol Courthouse and other buildings. Much distress prevails. For a consid
erable distance the Kanawha and Michigan Railway, between here and
Point Pleasant, is under water, and it will be four or five days before traffic
is resumed. The indications, however, are that to-night the flood has
reached its height and will commence to fall by morning.
CINCINNATI, March s.â During the last two days there lias been a
heavy rainfall, principally so-uth and east of the Ohio River, extending
from below the Kentucky River up to Morgantown, W. Va. To-night two
thirds of Charlestown, W. Va., is under water. The river at that point at this
writing is forty-one feet and two-fifths of an inch, which equals the highest
previous record at that point. The United States engineer says it will likely
reach one foot higher, making forty-two feet arid two-fifths of an inch. On
the north side of the Kentucky the streams are full, but not dangerous.
\bove Parkersburg to the source of the river the streams are high, but
not at all dangerous to the extent of those in West Virginia and Kentucky.
The Weather Bureau at this point sent out to-nigrht danger signals to Point
Pleasant, Catlettsburg and Portsmouth. The heaviest rise Is In the Great
ing off the lock of the door with a burglar was emptying burpau drawers
chisel, which he afterward threw away and overhauling them thoroughly In
and which was subsequently found, search of valuables.
She ran through the parlor and sittlnp When she confronted the man Miss
room right into the room where the Mirandi stamped her foot and ex-
influence" was to be inaugurated the United States would doubtless have
a say in the matter, with the probable preference for the province of Ctii-Li.
ROM K, March s.â Little attention is paid here trr the refusal of the Chi
nese Government to grant the requested lease of San Mun Bay, to be used
as a naval base and coaling station. No doubt is -entertained that the con
cession will be made after further negotiations. Rear Admiral Grenet em
barked to-day on the Italian cruiser Stromboli at Naples to take command
of the Italian squadron in Chinese waters.
LONDON, March 5. â The Rome correspondent of the Daily Mail says:
The Italian warships have landed marines at San Mun Bay, thus virtually
takfng possession. Ttaly will pay nearly Â£80,nno for the concession. The
Tsung-li-Yamen wishes to reduce the lease to fifty years.
According to the Peking correspondent of the Times the Tsung-li-Ya
men supports Great Britain against the protest of the Russian Government
regarding the terms of the Niu Chwang Railroad extension loan, recently
subscribed in London, the ground of Russia's objection being that the clause
appointing a British subject chief engineer of the lfne is in conflict with the
Russo-Chinese agreement.
The Peking correspondent of the Times says: It is asserted that since
the Tsung-li-Yamen returned Italy's dispatch Sir Claude Macdonald, British
Minister to China, has presented a note supporting Italy's demand, and it is
probable that Italy will now take possession of San Mun Bay, encountering
practically no resistance.
Kanawha, but the Little Kanawha, the Big Sandy, the Licking and the Ken
tucky rivers are pouring in tremendous floods. Nothing yet has been heard
from the Tennessee and the Cumberland, but from reports of the rainfall in
the watershed of the rivers it is presumed that they are keeping pace with
the rivers above them on the left bank of the Ohio. A saving clause in the
situation is the fact that everywhere south and east of the Ohio River the
weather to-night is windy, clear and cold. Still another condition favorable
to a comparatively slight flood in the Ohio is the fact that during the
warm weather of the ten days preceding this storm all the snow was melted
in the mountains and the floods there have been carried well down the river.
At all points on the Ohio River from Gallipolis down to the Kentucky
River the Ohio is rising. At Catlettsburg, where the Big Sandy comes in,
it is highest, forty-nine feet, and rising six inches an hour. There seems to
have been a trough of very heavy rainfall in West Virginia between the base
of the Alleghanies and the Ohio River. At Cincinnati the river was forty
eight feet at 9 o'clock to-night and has been rising three inches per hour for
the last fifteen hours. Unless the floods in the Tennessee and Cumberland
Rivers should prove much greater than anticipated and thus cause back
water the maximum stage here at Cincinnati will probably not exceed fifty
six feet. Should it reach that stage it will stop cars from running into the
Union Central Station, which will be a comparatively slight embarrassment.
No other roads here will be affected in the slightest by the stage of the river.
This prediction is based on the presumption that the weather will remain
fair for four or five days. __
RICHMOND, Va., March s.â The water in the James River is up twenty
nine feet at Columbia and is still rising. There is a heavy flush here and
fears are entertained of a disastrous flood to-morrow when the up-country
waters come down.. Merchants In the lower part of the city are removing
their goods. . ...
claimed:
"Get out! What are you doing?"
She then ran out of the house and
cried "Thief! Burglar!" and contin
ued to the home of Mrs. George Heard
on the next corner. Mrs. Heard was
hurriedly informed of the burglary and
telephoned for the Chief erf Police.
After Miss Mirandi left the Jennings
house the burglar fled. Three girls who
reside on Clay streetâ Hattie Fitzslm
mons, Olive Twombly and Bessie
Twomblyâ who had heard Miss Miran
di's cries, started in pursuit of the man,
Mis? Mirandi joining them after emerg
ing from the Heard home. They kept
close at the burglar's heels, running
from Clay street on Broadway to Riv-
erside avenue, down Riverside avenue
to Barson street and from Barson to
the Cnt Bias bridge. There the fellow
ran plump into the arms of Charles
Fitzsimmons and was captured. Chief
of Police Rawle was soon on the spot,
and within fifteen minutes after hav
ing first been detected the burglar was
in jail.
The fellow protests that he is inno
cent, but his story carries no weight,
as all the young ladies identify him.
In fact, after he was first detected he
never was lost to sight. He refused to
give his name to Sheriff Bess.
The culprit is a man of good appear
ance, has a smooth face and ruddy
complexion and was very well dressed.
On his person were found burglar tools
and two discharges from ships. One,
in the name of Thomas Dickson, was a
discharge from the ship Ventura, dated
at New York; the other, with the name
Harold Diekman, was dated at Hong
kong and was a discharge from the
ship Bedston Hill.

TOULON. March 5.â The naval
magazine of La Gouhrana, be
tween Lazyne and Toulon, in the
department of Var, Southern
France, exploded at 2:30 o'clock this
morning 1 . All of the soldiers on duty at
the magazine were killed and a number
of inhabitants of the district buildings,
which were razed, also fell victims.
Forty corpses have already been recov
ered. The cause of the explosion is
not known.
Fifty thousand kilogrammes of black
powder exploded. It looks as though
a volcanic eruption hafi occurred, the
country being swept almost bare within
a radius of two miles, houses destroyed,
trees overturned and distorted, fields
devastated and covered with stones and
impalpable black dust.
Some of the stones are enormous. One
weighing fifty kilogrammes fell in the
suburb of Pone de Las. Signs of the
explosion are evident in all the suburbs
of Toulon and in the city itself. Even
at St. Jean de Var, five miles distant,
windows were shattered and doors bat
tered in.
Later reports show that of the seven
sentries four were killed outright and
the others severely injured, the corporal
being literally scalped and the scalp
overhanging his face like a veil.
A large number of soldiers are now
I employed in clearing away the debris,
â  but the work is very difficult.
!' It is impossible to ascertain accurate
; ly the number killed, but it is believed
i that no fewer than a hundred -were
I injured.
Although it was a. clear night, the
I explosion was so terrific as to produce
a slight rainfall.
Fortunately the neighboring rmaga
zines escaped. It is now believed that
the explosion originated in chemical
decomposition in smokeless powder.
j There is no suggestion of foul play.
To-day the whole city is in mourning,
flags are at half-mast, the theaters are
draped and the casinos closed.
Both the government and municipal
authorities are forwarding relief funds.
M. Lockeroy, Minister of Marine, has
telegraphed 10,000 francs toward the
maintenance of the families of the vic
tims, and a public subscription has
been opened here.
Four of the injured have succumbed
to their injuries. It is believed that
fifteen are still buried in the debris.
All the bodies found or recovered are
terribly mutilated. Sixteen were found
in the rocks near the shore and it is
feared that others were precipitated
into the sea. A vehicle moving along
the road near the sea was lifted bodily
into the water by the force of the ex
plosion, two of its occupants being
drowned. The scene at the village of
La Goubrana was appalling.
Telegrams from Nice say the ex
plosidn was distinctly felt there.
TERRIBLE ACCIDENT
TO A CAR BUILDER

SAUSALITO. March s.â Daniel Whaley,
a car builder in the employ of the North
Pacific Coast Railway Company, was the
victim of a terrible accident yesterday af
ternoon which will probably cost him his
life. The accident was of a peculiar na
ture and due to carelessness on the part
of Whaley.
A train was pulling out of the shops ana
Whaley jumped on the rear of a coach to
deposit a nackage before the coach
emerged from the doorway. He was
caught between the coach and the door
way and literally made into a human roll
er Four ribs and a collarbone were brok
en and severe internal injuries were re
ceived by the unfortunate man. As the
train left the doorway he dropped to the
ground and was carried by his Fellow em
ployes to his home, where Drs.. Maya and
Crumpton rendered medical assistance.
Whaley has steadily grown worse, an*
thi<* evening Dr. Wickman was summoned
from San Rafael. The unfortunate man
is married and has two children.

of the Election of the Mexican Next Wednesday.
There Will Be No Extra Session.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. March s.â There is talk to
night that Jesse D. Grant will get a
block of Democratic votes to-morrow.
The scheme to vote for Jesse was
hatched early in the session and for
several days it was whispered as a
profound secret that nearly all of the
Democrats would line up for him, and
in the end make a strong pull to get
supporters of his brother, U. S. Grant,
to join them. The plan was not dcc"mcd
practical, as many members doubted
whether Jesse D. Grant was a resident
of California. However, the Grant fam
ily will poll a bigger vote than usual
to-morrow if the plans agreed upon to
night are not changed before the con
vention assembles.
The supporters of U. S. Grant are as
firm to-night as they have been at any
time since the balloting began. Indeed,
the claim is advanced that Grant is in
position to call into his camp three or
four new voter*, but is not inclined to
bring them in at this time, as a small
gain would not give him a decided ad
vantage and he does not care to take
any step at this time unless he takes a
decisive one.
The political Filipinos of the Burns
corral axe casting wistful glances at
the Grant column. The only explana
tion that can be given of Johnson's
remark that Burns would be chosen
Senator next Wednesday is based on
ihe hopes of those in the corral that
some of the Grant men will come out
and "vindicate" the "Colonel." Judge
Dibble, who is supposed to possess and
enjoy the confidence of Colonel Burns,
cannot give any explanation of John
son's prediction and does not seem to
attach any importance to the state
ment. Doubtless it was made as a bluff
to brace up the despondent touts.
Burns continues to hold daily confer
ences over the wire with his niastei,
Herrin, of the railroad company. The
long distance conversations take place
at Colonel "Wright's office, in the rail
road depot in this city. Herrin, in the

HAILS AMERICA'S ADVENT
AS A NEW POWER
LONDON, March s.â ln the introduc
tion of his new history of British India,
to be published to-morrow, Sir William
Wilson Hunter, former member of the
Indian Legislative Council and former
president of the Indian Education Com
mission, referring to the advent of the
United States as a colonizing power,
says:
"America starts upon her career of
Asiatic rule with an amplitude of re
sources and a sense of moral responsi
bility which no previous state of Chris
tendom brought to the work. In her
splendid and difficult task she will be
trammeled by no Portuguese inquisi
tion of the sixteenth century, nor by the
slave colonization of Holland In the
seventeenth, nor by the cynical rule for
gain of the rulers which, for a time,
darkened the British acquisition of In
dia in the eighteenth.
"The United States, in the govern
ment of their dependencies, will repre
sent the political conscience of the
nineteenth century. I hail their advent
ail previous performances in the polit
ical arena. It has come to this pass,
that a man aspiring to the high office of
United States Senator, to represent the
people of California and asking the
support of the Ilepublican members of
the Legislature, daily seeks his instruc
tions, n4* from the people or the repre
sentatives of the people, but from the
chief counsel of the Southern Pacific
Kailroad.
The best judges of the Senatorial sit
uation to-nipht predict that the Legis
lature will adjourn a week from next
Saturday. There is a belief that the
Burns touts will from this time on
fight to prevent the- choice of a Sen
ator. So far as Burns is concerned,
the handwriting is on the -.sail. Ho
cannot get a caucus, and without a cau
cus there is not the slightest chance of
his flection. It is extremely doubtful
if he could succeed with a caucus, but
as the majority of the Republicans in
the Legislature decided in the confer
ence that the party did not want a
caucus that settled the question.
There is some gossip concerning ad
journment next Saturday, but the
Speaker of the Assembly and leading
Senators figure that the session must
be prolonged another week. That view
is also expressed by Judge Dibble, who
is well advised as to the business on
hand and the length of time requ^-Â°d
to close up everything essential. It is
a settled fact that Governor Gage will
not call an extra session of the Legis
lature, no matter what happens.
Aft^r the arrival of the trains from
Pan Francisco to-night there was con
siderable talk ahout adjournment at
an earlier date than March IR. A de
termined effort may be made to-morrow
to fix an early time. Among the touts
i the threat is constantly made: "Burns
!cr no Senator." The supporters of
Barnes, Grant and Scott are fully de
termined that Burns shall not be
elected, and before the session ends
They may resolve to elect a Senator
despite the command of Burns to the

vate James Foley and Mrs. 'Williams, the
wife of Ordnance Sergeant Williams, and
bruising several others badly.
Eight soldiers, including Mrs. Williams
and her husband, were on their way to
the post. They met a team opposite the
powder magazine, a mile from town. They
â¢ took the outer side, when a check broke
and the mules became unmanageable.
The wagon and team rolled over twice be
fore they reached the bottom of the em
bankment.' Foley's head was caught un
der the wagon box and would have been
crushed if Mrs. Williams' shoulder had
not sustained the weight of the wagon.
Foley was badly cut and bruised, Mrs.
! Williams' shoulder was bruised and her
left ankle sprained, while two soldiers
were knocked senseless.

Change in the River Current Re-
moves All Trace of Illinois'
First Capital.
NASHVILLE, 111., March s.â By another
of those sudden shifts in current so com
mon to the -waters of the Mississippi
River, almost all of what little remained
of the historic town of old Kaskaskia, the
first settlement in the Mississippi Valley,
the first capital of the State of Illinois,
I and at one time the metropolis of the great
j Middle "West, was swept away to-day.
Ever since the change in the channel
of the Mississippi the ground upon which
the town stood has been crumbling away.
All the historic old' buildings, including
Governor Bond's mansion, ana the da
! State House, have tumbled into the river.
The few people who inhabited the tumbler
! down houses up to the present time were
I completely shut off from the outside
I world.
The remains of Berrlen Minard, the first
Lieutenant Governor of the State, which
rest in a vault of Italian marble, are ciose
to the river's edge, and but a few days
will elapse until the cemetery and the last
trace of the old town is obliterated.

BRUSSELS, March s.â Queen Marie Henriette, who has been suf
fering from broncho-pneumonia, had â  a serious relapse at noon to-day.
Her physicians were in constant attendance throughout the afternoon
and early this evening the last sacrament was administered. At that
hour there seemed no- hope of recovery, but a bulletin at 10 o'clock this
evening showed a slight improvement and afforded a base for reviving
hope. All the members of the family have been summoned.
Queen Marie Henriette of Belgium, a daughter of the late Archduke
Joseph of Austria, was born August 23, 1836. She married King Leopold
II of Belgium, then a Belgium Crown Prince, on August 22, 1853. Leo

ICE BREAKS UP IN
THE UPPER HUDSON
The Result Is a Flood at Troy Which
Threatens to Be Dis
astrous.
TROY. X. V., March s.â The ice in the
upper Hudson, the Mohawk and the Hos
sick River broke up to-night after several
days' thaw and a warm rain. The result
is a flood at this point and north of here
which threatens to be disastrous. The ice
is heavy and at Mechanicsvllle has formed
a gorge of great strength.
The back-up caused by this gorge has
submerged all adjoining lowlands and the
roadways are under water. Between this
city and Albany the ice became wedged in
Schuyler Creek and the mouth of Dry
River running through Watervllet.
Streets have been flooded in the latter
place and the Albany City Railway
tracks between Menands and Watervliet
are submerged, making it possible to use
but one track.
The docks along the river front here
are under water and the indications are'
that the freshet will reach the highest
point in many_yÂ£arÃ^

Rumor has it he so forgot his obligations
as a married man as to deceive a young
lady in that city.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, March s.â El
Porventra, discussing the situation
brought about by the orders from Ha
vana limiting the total expenditures
upon the departments of the provincial
administration to $10,000, says:
"There is only one course open to men
who are without work and food, namely,
to become banditti. Hunger demands
bread. The proceedings of the United
States authorities at Havana are evi
dently antagonistic to Major General
"Wood, and born of jealousy of his suc
cess and popularity among all classes
of Cubans. Three thousand men have
been thrown out of employment with
only a day's notice which must mean a
serious menace to public peace and
property."
The Independenria, El Cubano and
the Santiago Herald comment in much
the same strain.
Two companies of the Fourth Immune
Regiment are in the city to-day, nomi
nally to receive horses, but it is ex
pected that they will remain at least a

The court-martial .of Private John
Williams of the Ninth Immune Regi
ment, charged with complictiy in the
murderous affray at San Luis on No
vember 14. is still in session. Thus far,
the prosecution has offered two eye-wit
nesses, but the other testimony is con
flicting. The Judge Advocate com
plains that there is considerable per
jury among the officers of the regiment.
The accused is defended by Major Har
rison, whose orderly he was at the
time. The case will probably last an
other ten days, and a conviction is pos
sible.
GENERAL CAREY WILL
PAY THE CUBAN TROOPS
NEW YORK, March 5.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Pay
master General Carey has perfected ar-
rangements for going to Cuba next
week to pay off the Cuban army.
This means that an agreement has been
reached by General Gomez and Major
General Brooke regarding the payment
of the Cubans on the basis of the Pres
ident's suggestion to General Gomez
through Mr. Porter.
General Carey will take the entire
appropriation of $3,000,000 to Cuba, $1,
--500,000 of which will be in silver and the
remainder either in gold or in bills. He
will leave New York on one of the gov
ernment transports, to which the money
will be transported from the sub-treas
ury, and upon his arrival at Havana
he will report to General Brooke.
Immediately upon the payment of the
officers and men the troops will be dis
banded and the Cubans will return to
their ordinary avocations. As soon as
the army is disbanded the question of
the withdrawal of the American troops
will be considered.

VAST APPROPRIATIONS
OF THE LAST CONGRESS
In All $1,566,890,016 Has Been Set Aside for National
Expenses, lint Nearly One-Third ol This Is
Owing to the War With Spain.
WASHINGTON. March s.â The of
ficial statement of Representative Jo
seph G. Cannon of Illinois, the chair
man of the House Appropriations Com
mittee, summing up the appropriations
of the Fifty-fifth Congress, shows an
aggregate appropriation by the entire
Congress of $1,566,890,016, and for the
session just closed a total of $fi7.Xfi58,400,
with authority for contracts subject to
future appropriations amounting to
$50,000,000. Chairman Cannon's state
ment in full follows:
The appropriations made at tho session
of Congress just closed amount approxi
mately to $673,658,400, and show an appar
ent reduction of $210,071.000 under the ap
propriations made at the preceding ses
sion. This is attributable to the large ex
penses occasioned by the war with Spain
that were provided for during: the preced
ing session. The entire appropriations
made by the Fifty-fifth Congress aggre
gate $1.58fi,590.016 28. Of this -sum J482.562,
--083 17 is directly chargeable to our late
war with Spain nr incident thereto. De
ducting this charge from the whole
amount of the appropriations, the re
mainder, $1,084,327,632 81 represents the
ordinary or normal appropriations made
by the Fifty-fifth Congress.
The appropriations made by the pre
ceding Congress, the Fifty-fourth,
amounted to $1,044,580,273 87. A compari
son shows an increase in ordinary appro
priations made by this Congress over the
Fifty-fourth of $39,747,000, but this appar
ent increase is more than accounted for
by increases under eight items alone,
namely: For pensions, $4,000,000; for the
postal service, $16,000,000; for rivers and
harbors, including work under contracts
previously authorized, $3,600,000; for new
ships for the navy, $6,000,000; for begin
ning the work of the twelfth census,
$1,000,000; for the Paris Exposition, $1,200,
--000; for new public buildings, including
the building for the Department of Jus
tice, and for site, and partial construc
tion of the new Government printing of
fice, about $5,000,000, and for payment of
judgments rendered against the Govern
ment on account of French spoliations
and under the Bowman act, $3,100,000.
These very natural and necessary in
creases in public expenditures, on ac
count of the pension list, the growth of
the postal service in response to the de
mands of commerce, the improvement of
the great waterways of the country and
for Increase of the navy, the construction
of needed buildings to accommodate the
Government service in the cities of the
country, the taking of the census, the
participation of the nation in the great
exposition to be held at Paris next year
and the payment of the French spoliation
judgment and Bowman act case's so long
(.oiisidered by and pressed upon Congress
aggregate $39,900,000â more than dissipat
ing the entire apparent increase in the
ordinary appropriations by this Congress
over those made by the Fifty-fourth Con
gress.
In addition to the direct appropriations
made at this session, contracts were au
thorized, subject to future appropriations
to be made by Congress, amounting to
about $70,000,000. cf this amount $44,000,000
is for additional ships for the navy, $22.
--500,000 is for work on rivers and harbors,
and something over $3,000,000 is for public
buildings. The contract system is of ne
cessity applied to the construction of new
warships, which require periods' of years
for their construction. In the case of
river and harbor improvements and the
construction of public buildings experi
ence has shown that the authorization of
contracts tends materially to expedite and
cheapen the same.
Dockery of Missouri, the ranking
Democratic member of the House Ap
propriations Committee, made the fol
lowing statement, giving the Democrat
ic view:
This Congress easily surpac-.es all its
predecessors in the stupendous aggregate
of its appropriations. It was thought that
the Fifty-first Congress, commonly known
as the ''Billion-Dollar Congress," had in
point of extravagance of appropriations
touched a limit which would not be
reached or at least surpassed by any of
its successors. This Congress, however,
has far exceeded the appalling total of
appropriations there made, and it will be
remembered that the "Billion-Dollar Con
gress" was followed by overwhelming dis
aster to the Republican party at the en
suing election. ;â¢Â£".;-â¢â ;.
Confronted with a war with Spain, re-'
quiring the imposition of additional taxa
tion, tt is obvious that rigid economy
should have been applied in all other di
rections to the expenditure of public
money. The people were willing to meet
all the demands upon the national treas
ury made necessary by the Spanish war,
but it is fair to presume that they ex
pected their representatives, in view of tne
cheerful disposition manifested to meet
these added burdens, to limit the ordinary
apropriations to the necessities ,of a wise
and economical administration, These ex
pectations have not been realized.
The result is an annual deficiency in
the country's revenues amounting on the
first of this month to $99,109,554 50. This
deficiency, as shown by a recent conserva
tive estimate by Chairman Cannon of the
Appropriations Committee, will probably
reach $159,000,000 on the 30th of June next.
It is impossible to estimate with absolute
accuracy the treasury deficiency for the
coming fiscal year. The Secretary of the
Treasury, in his annual report made in
December last, estimates it at about $31 -
000,000, but it is now apparent that It will
not be less than $100,000,000. It is almost
certain, therefore, that the Government
will be compelled during .the calendar
year 1900 to face an actual treasury defi
ciency. The $462,000,000 of income arising
from the sale of bonds under this admin
istration ana that of President Cleveland
will then have been exhausted, and the
treasury will pass from the condition of
a borrowed surplus to an actual defi
ciency. Such a condition must be met,
either by increased taxation or by the is
sue of treasury certificates, or by an ad
ditional bond issue.
Notwithstanding this deplorable treas
ury situation, which has been called over
and over again to the attention of Con
gress and the country, appropriations
have been made which, in many cases
have not been warranted by the interests
of the public service, or which, if proper
in themselves, should have been post
poned until the national income should be
ample to meet all Its liabilities without
the necessity of bond, Issues.
The appropriations of the original "bil
lion dollar Congress amounted to $1,035.
--680,109 94. The appropriations of the Con
gress just ended reach the mighty aggre
gate of $1,566,890,014 28. It is fair to deduct
from this total $482,562,083 47,. made neces
sary to meet the liabilities of the Spanish
war. So if we deduct from the grand
total the liabilities on account of the war
with Spain, it appears that the appropria
tions for the ordinary expenses of the
Government are $1,084,327,932 81. The ap
propriations of the Congress just ended
to meet the ordinary governmental ex
penses exceed those of the preceding
(Fifty-fourth) Congress by $39,747.65*5 9C
Not only this, but the contract liabilities
authorized by the Congress just expired
for new ships and their armament, pub
lic buildings, rivers and harbors and mis
cellaneous items amount to $70,602,524. If
therefore, to the ordinary appropriations
is added the liabilities on .account of these
authorized contracts, iwe ascertain that
the appropriations and contract liabilities
9' m 456 n Bl to the tremendous total of $1,154,-
These increased appropriations have
gone for French spoliation claims, pub
lic buildings, rivers and harbors; Bowman
act claims and hundreds of other projects
some meritorious, but many of them not
entitled to recognition by the National
Government. In nearly every branch of
the civil service of the Government there
has been an increase of appropriations.
The time has come to reform the scale
of national expenditures. The reckless
improvidence of the outgoing Congress
will at least serve the good purpose of
arousing the people and of causing them
to send representatives to the national
capital who will reduce the burdens im
posed by rioteus appropriations.

EVIDENCE OF MURDER.
Suspicious Death of a Young Woman
in New York.
NEW YORK, March s.â Miss Magda
lene Dorn, 20 years old, died last night
in a room occupied by James J. Conley
at 211 West Eighty-second street, under
circumstances so suspicious that Conley
was taken into custody pending an in
vestigation by the Coroner.
Conley called at the home of Dr. Brink
er and urged him to accompany him at
once to his room to attend a young wom
an who, he said, had fallen seriously 111.
When they arrived at the place they
found Miss Dorn lying on the bed, dead.
Gas was flowing from two gas jets. Con
ley seemed greatly agitated and ex
plained that the young woman had been
visiting him and was taken suddenly ill.
He left her to go for the doctor. He says
she must have turned on the gas during
his absence and become asphyxiated.
The police did not take kindly to thi3
theory and placed Conley under arrest.
Conley was reticent about his relations
with Miss Dorn.

NEW YORK. March s.â The Call cor

of George Crocker, second vice presi
dent of the Southern Pacific Company,
to the statement made by C. P. Hunt
ington, president of the company, in a
letter addressed to Edward Ivison of

Mr. Crocker said: "It has never been

The Call correspondent in her apart
ments at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, and
when he had stated his mission she
said:
"Mr. Crocker and I have not deferred
the closing of the gap between Surf and

j ular reason ivh . â¢â â â¢ construction of
j the road had been delayed. If the rail

Kindly say that I am not an obstruc

"It is only during the last two

I 'that 1 have felt that I was a free

"There has been a disagreement over
I this matter," said Mr. Huntington,
j when seen at his residence this even
ing. "We made the promise years ago
to close the gap, and certainly should

I and myself met and considered the ad

ito proceed. I have given instructions
to push things vigorously, and I am

I stated at the beginning â that we have

Building Trades Council they promptly
refused to do so. Delegate Archibald
said that since that time a strong effort
has been made to force the paper
hangers at work upon the University
Club to strike.
This effort is still being made by the
Building Trades Council. A committee
from the latter body informed the con
tractor who employs the painters that
if he continued to permit the men to
stay at work they would order strikes
on all buildings where men of unions
affiliated with the Building Trades

steps to remove the friction.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, MARCH 6. 1899.
SAYS HIS WIFE
BROKE A PLEDGE
George Thalman Fights
a Divorce Case.
SENSATIONAL SALINAS SUIT
RANCHER RETURNS TO OPPOSE
A SEPARATION.
After Twenty Years of Married Life
He Left the State on the Promise
That No Action Would
Be Brought.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, March s.â After twenty
years of married life Mr. and Mrs.
George Thalman, residents of Prune
dale, but prominent here and at Wat
sonville, have separated, and the re
sult is a divorce case brought under
peculiar circumstances and promising
to be prolific in sensations.
George Thalman, a prominent archi
tect of Little Rock, Ark., married a
lady of the same city in IS7B. Two chil
dren were born, a son and daughter,
and both are living. About three years
ago the couple moved to California, set
tling in Watsonville, where Mr. Thal
| man conducted a lucrative business.
Last May they purchased a fruit ranch
in Prunedale, abovft seven miles from
! this city. There they have since re
' sided, owing to the husband's ill health.
llt is at this place that the family
i troubles appear to have become serious,
; although the wife claims that for the
j last seventeen years she has been medi
tating on leaving her husband.
Two weeks ago she and her two chil
dren left the orchard home and moved
into this city. The husband remained
there several days and then followed
them to Salinas. He sought an inter
view with his wife, and, according to
| her story, during her absence he gained
i admission to her apartment at a local
I hotel, hid himself, and when she en
i tered sprang upon her and threatened
to end her life with a knife if she did
i not return to the ranch. By promising
i to go she escaped and then sent for the
Sheriff.
Thalman was arrested and placed un-
I der heavy bonds, which he could not
give, for the reason, as he claimed, his
wife had all the pr<rperty in her name.
The wife relented on the promise that
her husband would deed everything to
her and leave the country and she would
not prosecute him. On her part she
agreed, it is said, that she would ask
for no divorce for alleged cruelty.
All was arranged and Mr. Thalman
' left home children and property to
battle with life alone in an Eastern
State No sooner had he left than the
woman commenced suit for divorce on
' the ground of cruelty. Friends of the
husband informed him by wire at
Truckee, and as a result he is back
I in Salinas and asserts th.t now he will
i see the matter out at any cost or come
: what may. Thalman, it is asserted,
will be placed under heavy bonds to-
I morrow to keep the peace. When the
divorce case comes up it will prove
highly sensational and many scandal
ous assertions will be made. Certain
prominent Watsonville people will be
implicated. The son, it is asserted, has
taken his father's side. Mrs. Thalman
is at present on the ranch, while Mr.
Thalman is here.
Thalman was at one time in the As
sembly of the State of Washington and
I a very influential man.

The Novelist's Daughter, Josephine,
Dangerously 111 With
Pneumonia.
NEW YORK, March s.â According to
the reports of his physicians. Rudyard
Kipling is now far advanced on the way
to recovery. All through the hours of
Saturday niprht and early this morning
the favorable conditions increased. He
slept peacefully many hours, and when
he awoke it was clear that he had made
another powerful stride toward health.
"The improvement in Mr. Kipling s con
dition " said Mr. Doubleday this morn
ing '"'is perhaps more marked than at
any previous period of his illness. He Is
emphatically a winner this time."
The following official bulletin was post
ed at the Hotel Grenoble at 2 o clock this
afternoon: , . ...
"Mr Kipling is convalescing, with
slight" continuing fever. The resolution
in the lungs has advanced, though it is
U Â°l\ \vas C said Mr. Kipling's daugh
ter Josephine is dangerously ill at the
home of Miss De Forrest. She is report
ed to have suffered a slight relapse dur

in the condition of Elsie, the youngest
daughter, who is= suffering from pneu
monia at the Hotel Grenoble.

HIS HOLINESS SHOWS
MARKED IMPROVEMENT
Surprises His Physicians by Reciting
a Lengthy Section From
Dante's "Paradise."
ROME, March s.â The Pope, who was In
excellent spirits on rising this morning,
desired the attendants In the antecham
ber to attend mass in his own room. The
following bulletin was issued at la. m.:
"His Holiness passed a quiet night, get
ting several hours' sleep. All his natural
functions, the pulse and the temperature
are normal. It has not been necessary to
re-examine the wound. No medical bul
letin will be issued this evening."
His Holiness, who arose at 10:30, re
turned to bed at 1:30 p. m. He has,re
sumed his ordlniary diet and his condi
tion mentally and physically, is good. He
engaged his physicians in conversation
and to their amazement recited the en
tire last portion of the seventh canto of
Dante's â¢'Paradise." commenting upon
various passages as he proceeded. Pro
fessor Mazzonl afterward said:
"He Is indeed a marvelous man."
Dr Lapponi hopes to be able to dis
pense with the bulletins altogether in the
course of two or three days.
STORIES OF THE CZAR'S
HEALTH NOT TRUE
Published in a Copenhagen Paper Be
cause of a Resentful Feeling
of the Danes.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gor
don Bennett.
BERLIN, March 5.â 1 have heard much
of the total collapse of the Czar's health.
No one believed the reports until they
were published in a somewhat circum
stantial form by a Copenhagen paper.
The stories are untrue.
It appears that the Inhabitants of Den
mark are annoyed because the Czar used
his influence with the Kaiser to prevent
recent events in Schleswig-Holsteln, and
secondly because he is considered to have
neglected Denmark by not visiting Copen
hagen every summer; also these points
are accentuated by the Czar not having
given way in all matters to his mother.

â  TACOMA, March s.â Two more French missionaries have been mur- â .

O the disturbed conditions of that entire section. At Ichang it is known o

Â° Scholars are being withdrawn from the mission schools and mission o
Â£ work has been almost suspended. Native Christians are treated with the >

-â¦- was stripped of her clothing, tied to a wall and whipped until she sur- +
o rendered deeds to the family homestead. The usual excuse for these pro- O
Â£ ceedings is that the Christians are no longer Chinese. J
+ The rebellion has now spread into Shangtung, where some German +
O mineral prospectors were recently attacked and beaten. The mission- o
Â£ aries are hoping Germany will take steps to end the anarchy now Â£

SCHLEY REMAINS
SAMPSON'S SENIOR
Outcome of the Senate's
Failure to Act.
NO REWARD FOR BRAVERY
NOMINATIONS FOB, HEROIC ACTS
ALL HELD UP.
Naval Officers Indignant Over the
Result of the Controversy Be
tween Sampson and
Schiey.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 5.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: In view
of the failure of the Senate to confirm
the nomination of Rear Admiral Schley
and Rear Admiral Sampson for ad
vancement for heroic conduct In bat
tle, speculation is rife in naval circles
as to the action which will be taken
by the department.
One thing is certain: Secretary Long
will not submit to the President for
transmission to the Seriate in Decem
ber next the nominations of these of
ficers for advancement. And it is there
fore plainly apparent that Rear Ad
miral Schley will remain senior to Rear
Admiral Sampson unless the depart
ment should establish the correctness
of the reflections upon Rear Admiral
Schley.
Such an investtgtion Is by no means
an improbability. Serious consideration
has been given the matter by Secretary
Long, and some of the officials of the
department are urging him to take such
a step.
It is announced that if Rear Admiral
Schley asks for a court of inquiry the
department will promptly order it. In
the meantime Rear Admiral Schley will
enjoy the pay and allowances of a major
general of the army, while Rear Ad
miral Sampson will draw the pay and
allowances of a brigadier general.
Naval officers are indignant at the ac
tion of the Senate in holding up all
other nominations for advancement as
a result of the battle of Santiago be
cause of the Sohley-Sampson contro
versy, when they say that they were
not concerned in any way in it. The
department does not intend, however,
to permit any further developments in
the controversy, unless it be through a
court of inquiry, and to this end will
not transmit any nominations to the
Senate in December next unless It be
that of Naval Constructor Hobson and
officers recommended for advancement
by Rear Admiral Dewey.
"THE AMERICAN BOY"
PROJECT FAILED
But Agitation to Have a Battleship
So Named Will Be Continued
in the Next Congress.
CINCINNATI, March 5.-Amonf( the pro
jects to which the short session rf Con
gress was unable to give favorable con
sideration was that to have a battleship
named "The American Boy." The na
tional committee of the American Boy
Association, January 20, decided to visit
Washington in a body and appeal to the
President, Secretary Long and members
of Congress to name one of the new ships
"the American Boy" and allow r-nntribu
tlons which the youth of the country have
sent here and will continue to send from
the first installment for its construction.
This committee reached Washington
January 26 and had a satisfactory inter
view with President McKinley, after
ward seeing Senators, Representatives
and others on January 30. Representa
tive Bromwell of Cincinnati offered a joint
resolution authorizing the Secretary of
the Navy to call the next battleship con
structed "the American Boy" and to re
ceive and deposit in the United States
Treasury as a special fund for the con
struction of said battleship all contribu
tions which may be tendered to him for
the purpose of defraying the expensed
thereof, said contributions to be in addi
tion to any amount that mi^ht be appro
priated for the construction of battle
ships.
Secretary Long has advised the com
mittee of the law to name all battleships
after States, cruisers after cities, cxc.
This measure was favorably reported by
the Naval Committee, but it was killed in
the House on a point of order by Boutelie.
The boys have returned from Washington
determined to press their work harder
than ever and they say they are receiving
letters of encouragment from all partÃ of
the country. They pay their own ex
penses and* deposit all contributions in
the Market National Bank, and are con
fident that they will succeed at the next
session of Congress.
Santa Cruz's Powder Output.
SANTA CRUZ, March s.â The powder
works are again running full blast. Over
200 men were employed yesterday. Ten
thousand dollars is paid monthly in
wages. The present output daily is 700
fcega Of blasting powder and 6000 pounds
of smokeless powder. All of the latter
goes East. It has been found by the
Navy Department that the smokeless i
powder manufactured here is most suc
cessful with the ten, twelve and thirteen- |
inch guns. Plans are under way to en
large the plant. Within the next few
months there will he constructed a new
glaze mill, a pulverizer, a tar drying
house and a foundry. There are suf
ficient contracts for powder to keep tne
mills running night and day for the next
two years.
GENERAL MILES
AND BAD BEEF
Depends on Testimony
of Enlisted Men
TO PROVE HIS CHARGES
BELIEVES THAT HE AND NOT
THE MEAT IS MADE ISSUE.
The Commanding Officer of the Army
May Decide to Challenge the Im
partiality of Judge Advo
cate Davis.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March s.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: Upon the "men who ate
the beef" â enlisted regulars and volun
teer officers and men â General Miles is
relying to prove the allegations he made
that the army foc-d supply was re
sponsible for the illness among soldiers
during the war with Spain. He read
with equanimity reports of the testi
mony before the court of Inquiry of
commanding and commissary officers
that they had heard no complaints from
their men and that "the food was bet
ter than most of them had before en
tering the army," because he believed
their motives were self-evident.
He refused at first to admit his con
viction that the administration was
trying to bolster up the War Investi
gating- Committee's report that he was
derelict in performing his duty, in order
eventually to open a way to depose him
from command of the army. But he
was led, it appears, to conclude that
he and not bad beef was "issue joined"
in th<! case when the court allowed the
extraordinary statements by Colonel
Woodruff, assistant commissary gen
eral, to go unchallenged, and when the
cc-urt put non-commissioned officers to
the test of mixed-up dishes of roast
beef. General Miles has openly called
this a deliberate effort to discredit his
honest witnesses.
An effort has been made to show that
the complaints of bad rations issued to
the men on the Yale, on which General
Miles went to Porto Rico, were made
to him on shipboard, and that he
neither reported nor heeded them. The
court of inquiry thinks this vital sup
port of the charge against Miles of
neglect of duty.
General Miles will show when recalled
that he knew there was "rotten" meat
and short rations on board, and that
he personally secured the use of the
ship's galleys for the men, so that they
could cook their bacon and warm their
tomato stew.
Evidence as to the chemical treat
ment of refrigerated beef will be sub
mitted at the last sessions of the Court
cf Inquiry. It promises to be convin
cing.
It is asserted that General Miles may
be led to challenge the impartiality of
Judge Advocate Davis, if he persists in
his apparent disposition to let evidence
unfavorable to any of the food supply
except canned roast beef get on record.
Friends of Miles recall that Colonel
Davis wrote a report several years ago
adverse to the bill to make General
Miles a lieutenant general.
CASE OF SMALLPOX
FOUND AT CLEVELAND
Inmates of a Large Apartment House
Placed Under Strict Quaran
tine.
CLEVELAND, March 5.â A case of
smallpox was discovered to-day in a big
down town apartment house, in which
nearly 400 people are living. The victim
is an attorney and he is the room
mate of Frederick L. Taft, Assistant
County Solicitor. The sick man was sent
to the* Smalpox Hospital, while Mr. Taft
was committed to the Detention House
and all the inmates of the building were
quarantined in the apartment house.
The situation is ludicrous in some re
spects. Those who were in could not get
out, and those who were out when tne
case was discovered were refused admit
tance to their rooms unless they were will-
Ing to submit to the quarantine regula
tions. Most of the people took it good-na
turediy. They communicated with their
friends by telephone and some of them
let down flaskets by ropes from the upper
stories and hauled up various supplies, of
which they were in need.
WOOLEN GOODS COMBINE.
PHILADELPHIA, March s.â lt seems
to be generally anticipated in wool circles
in this city that the amalgamation of a
number of the larger woolen manufactur
ing concerns of this city into a large com
pany is a matter of the near future. This
is expected 10 follow as a result of the re
cent formation in New York of the Amer
ican 'Woolen Association.
All the wool manufacturers who were
approached on the subject preserved a
strict reticence. Some of the wool deliv
erers, however., who are in close touch
with the manufacturers, intimated that
the woolen goods market had been in a
very unsatisfactory condition for some
time past and if there was any movement
looking to a consolidation of interests it
was due to this cause. Methods in vogue,
it wa.s said, had placed the manufacturer
at the mercy of the buyer, and trade
agreements had proved of little benefit to
the former.

SANTA ROSA MAN ROBBED

One Malefactor Escapes and Another
Makes a Break for Liberty at
Sausalito, but Is Recap

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TIBURON, March s.â Six of the pea
and shell game operators who reaped a
rich harvest at the expense of the un
wary last summer returned to their old
"stamping ground" to-day and met with
a warm reception. All were arrested and
sufficient evidence to convict them was
obtained before they fully realized what
was going on, but the element of excite
ment was added to the affair by two at
tempts to escape from the clutches of
the officers, one of which was success
ful. One of the malefactors broke away
and managed to get as far as San Fran
cisco, but was caught by Creed just as
he was trying to sneak off the boat at
the slip.
The six men came to Tiburon this aft
ernoon and soon had their illegal game In
full blast. They finally fleeced a promi
nent Santa Rosa contractor out of $115
and a merry row resulted. While the
contractor, whose name could not be

ing about the scene a machinist named
Harris telephoned a friend in Sausallto
to inform Constable Garrity of what was
going on. Instead of Garrity, Creed came
over in a boat and placed the six under
arrest. One of them broke away and
jumped aboard the train for San Rafael
as It was pulling out of the station. The
others offered to refund the contractor's
money, but Creed grabbed it and kept it
as evidence.
Justice Bellrude was sent for, and took
the men to Sausallto. They gave the
names of J. Schubner, George Brooks, E.
Goldberg, H. Hickley and John Smith..
While they were at the ferry slip under
charge of I^ouis Becker, Creed being ab
sent, Brooks ran through the gate and
aboard the last boat for the metropolis.
Creed returned in time to get aboard as
the boat was leaving the slip. He discov

the San Francisco ferry and gave him
Into the charge of two policemen, who
took him to the Harbor Police Station.
All the men were charged with having
violated a State gaming law, and it is the
intention of the authorities of Marin
County to make an example of them. The
four at Sausalito tried to get bondsmen,
but failed and werf locked up in the
town jail for the night.

SALE OF UNION
PACIFIC LANDS
Six Million Acres to Be
Disposed Of.
GREAT AUCTION AT OMAHA
COMPANY CERTAIN TO BID IN
THE PROPERTY.
Following Confirmation of the Sale
the Large Tracts Will Be Put
on the Market at
Once.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, March s.â At 10 o'clock vo
morrow morning, at the Courthouse in
this city, the Union Pacific Railway
Company will begin one of the heaviest
auction sales of public lands ever held
in the country. The lands aggregate
6,000,000 acres and are covered by the
sinking fund mortgage given by the
company on December 18, 1873, to the
Union Trust Company of New York as
trustee. The lands are located in Ne
braska, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah.
The disposition c-f the property and the
confirmation of the same will practi
cally bind up all the financial difficul
ties of the road incurred previous to
the taking control by the present man
agement.
The number of acres and their loca
tion are approximately as fallows: Ne
braska, 1,107,759; Colorado, 342,534; Wyo
ming, 4,062,640, and Utah, 618,824 acres.
Sherman R. Day, as special master,
will make the sale, and he will offer the
various tracts separately and then as a
whole, disposing of the property in the
manner which brings the most money.
The upset price is $4,605,000 for all the
land in the four States, which is 6,131,559
acres.
It probably will require about thirty
days after the sale before it will be
confirmed by the United States Court,
but after the confirmation the Union
Pacinc Company will put the land on
the market without delay.
There is little question that the prop
erty will be bid in by the Union Pa
cific Company, represented by Vice
President Cornish, who arrived in the
city to-day. After the sale to-morrow
Mr. Cornish will go to Colorado, Wyo
ming and Utah to attend the sales of
the lands in those States, which will
be held during the week. The officials
of the Union Pacinc Company antici
pate an almost unparalleled influx of
settlers to these lands during the com
ing year. _^_________

THE BUSINESS OF RECORD-BREAKING
THE United States seems to have gone into the
business of record-breaking. Each succeeding
month breaks the record of its predecessor in
some way or other. This cheerful procedure has been
going on for a year or more, and the end is apparently
not yet. November was the busiest ever known; De
cember beat it with distance to spare; January was the
heaviest opening month in the history of the country;
and now comes February with an exhibit at which
we are expected to hold up our hands in mute admira
tion. The Clearing-house exchanges of the country
were about $7,000,000,000, against $5, 567, 553-000 in
February. 1898. In all the years of weekly commercial
reporting there has been no week in which the
country made such a general good showing as it did
last week. The gain in bank clearings was large,
being 39.4 per cent, and there was a marked advance
in wages, voluntary in most cases, an immense and
urgent call for iron and steel manufactures at soaring
prices, a marked improvement in the demand for cot
ten and dry goods, and a decrease in failures to 177,
against 232 for the same week last year.
But it must not be forgotten that there is always an
increase in trade when the conditions are normal.
The population is continually increasing, and if there
were no increase in the volume of business it would
show that commerce was not keeping up with the
gain in population. So some of this extraordinary
gain that we are continually hearing about is really
no gain at all. Still, it cannot be gainsaid that the
country on the whole is extremely prosperous, and
excepting here on the Pacific coast, where the dry
weather checks trade the business of the United States
is really very large and increasing.
There are certain indications, however, that the
tables are being slightly turned in some directions. In
a recent financial circular Henry Clews, the New York
banker, who keeps pretty close watch on commercial
conditions, called attention to the fact that the ratio
of exports to imports had begun to decrease, though
the balance of trade is still enormously in favor of
this country. Wall street, too, has apparently scented
a mare's nest somewhere, for there was quite a decline
in stocks last week, those stocks which have lately
been booming being the chief sufferers. The money
market, too, hardened somewhat, and the money
lenders showed a disposition to object to industrials
as collateral. As an offset to this, however, the recent
heavy selling of our securities by foreigners has
ceased, and they are now buying again, as shown by
the fact that outgoing steamers from New York are
once more carrying away large blocks of our stocks,
principally low-priced securities, which, being com
paratively cheap now. promise a profit later on. It
is proper to add in this connection that the decline
was not serious. The cause of the current distrust
of industrials is a curious one; the demand was so
sharp that prices advanced to a point where foreigners
could buy more cheaply elsewhere, and as they have
already begun to do this the long heads in Wall street
are becoming cautious. It seems to be a case of too
much prosperity, which, we are told, is harder to bear
than adversity.
Local conditions show no change whatever. We are
still wholly dependent on the weather. The threat
ened rainstorm in the middle of the week did not get
below San Francisco, and the northern part of the
State got only from a quarter to half an inch, though
this was sufficient to keep the crops growing another
month in that section. The coast counties as usual
got the lion's share. The San Joaquin and Salinas
valleys are still dry, and unless they get rain very soon
the painful experiences of 1898 are likely to be re
peated. They can run along for a little time yet,
however.
Of course this has a quieting effect on local trade.
California is essentially a producing State, and if the
farmer is not prosperous none of the rest of us are.
The conditions are ripe for a season of commercial
activity, but nothing short of a good rain all over the
State will set the wheels running. As a rule, however,
thanks to the copious rainfall in the early part of
January, the crops are in better condition than at this
time last year, and last year we had enough to eat and
some to sell besides. So even at the worst we are not
very badly off.
A wise person has said that the poorest use possible
to make of a man was to hang him. This is a good
rule generally, but it docs not apply to highbinders.
Just now there is current a rumor that Dreyfus is to
he set free. Every such rumor naves the way for a
denial, and thus keeps alive interest in the matter.
Bailey has balked as leader of the House minority,
but a suspicion exists that the minority balked first
FOR THE STATE OND FOR THE PARTY
AS the time draws nearer for the adjournment of
the Legislature the Senatorial contest becomes
more critical. Public attention is turned with
increasing intentness to Sacramento, where the ma
jority of the Republican legislators are standing firmly
for the honor of the party and of the State against the
assaults, the intrigues and the machinations of a gang
of self-seeking politicians backed by the corrupt and j
corrupting power of the Southern Pacific Company.
The Republican party pledged itself to the people j
in the last campaign that the railroad was out of poli- j
tics. The representatives of the party in the Legisla- |
ture have now to maintain that pledge by shutting the j
door against the railroad in its desire to elect one i
of its most unscrupulous allies to the United \
States Senate. The duty thus far has been performed
by a two-thirds majority of the Republicans with a j
notable firmness. The railroad and its hirelings have
been able to win over to Burns but a mere fraction
o. f the party, and it is safe to say every member of that
fraction will disappear from politics when his pres
ent term of office is over.
In the meantime the railroad and the political ;
traitors who have sought to ruin the Republican party j
in California have resorted to every means their cun- j
ning could devise or their courage undertake to ac- j
complish their end. The threats of bullies and the i
cajolery of tricksters have alike been used to win
votes, but with the exception of the threeâ Wright,
Jilson and Simpsonâ their efforts have been vain.
! The overwhelming majority of the representatives of j
the party have remained true to their Republicanism
and their pledges. They have yielded nothing to
bribes, bullying or cunning.
Baffled in its efforts to get back into power in poli
tics by a direct way, the railroad has been seeking to
sneak in through a secret caucus and win by indirec
tion. Every argument the most ingenious casuistry
can construct has been set up in favor of this specious
scheme, and it is certain that extreme tactics will be
made use of to carry it through before the Legisla
ture adjourns
The time is now short and the conspirators against
the State and the party are desperate. The crisis in
the contest has surely been reached. It is that fact j
that attracts public attention and fixes it so intently
upon Sacramento. It is safe to say that not even
during the stress of the ballotings of the first week will j
so close a watch be kept on the vote as will be from !
this time on.
It is not likely that any Republican who has stood
firm for the right so long will fail now. No sane man
will follow the example and share the disgrace of the j
three weaklings who yielded to Burns and Herrin,
when by holding on the course they kept in the past
they can return with honor to their constituents and
be greeted with the words, "Well done, good and j
faithful servant."
PROFESSIONAL FEES.
DOCTORS complain that wealthy people refuse
to pay the legitimate price for being snatched
as brands from the burning. (The figure is,
perhaps, unfortunate, but let it go.) In other words,
they say that the rich balk at the charges the doctors
make. The question is of course a delicate one, and
members of the medical fraternity are in a stew, for
when they turn to the courts they do not find the
ready sympathy for which they pine. There are few
jurymen who have not at some time been flabber
gasted and paralyzed by violent contact with a bill for
medical attendence.
Nearly as a layman may be permitted to judge the
legitimate, reasonable fee of a doctor is the sum he
can get. He might lance a boil that a poor man
brought to his office and expect only $2 or such a
trifle. He might be called to the house of Dives, find
there a similar boil and, lancing it, calmly send a bill
for $1000. In the first instance he would be satisfied.
In the second instance he would rebel at any tendency
to demur, and, taking the matter into the tribunal of
justice, swear and get a regiment of fellow-practition
ers to swear that $1000 was only unreasonable in being
too modest. They would tell of the long years of
training necessary to equip one for the successful
lancing of a boil, the nights of study, the nervous
strain, and in all likelihood get a verdict for a respect
able sum.
We have no quarrel with the doctors, and they are
welcome to all they can recover; only when they re
ceive for a few days' work an amount which to a wage
worker would represent a year's income, and while
earning this have also the privilege of attending on
other patients, they must not expect outside their own
ranks an active indorsement.
It is understood that some of them are preparing a
blacklist to embrace the names of obdurate million
aires who decline to pay a fortune for services which
would cost others only a few months' salary. The
millionaires refuse to place on their own soundness
of body the estimate which appears in accounts ren
dered, and they are to be taught a lesson. This is a
matter in which people in ordinary circumstances need
not take an active interest. They are merely specta
tors at a battle of giants and have a right to hope that
the best giant will win.
THE HARBOR COMMISSION^ BILL.
WHEN Senator Dickinson's Harbor Commis
sion bill came up for consideration on Satur
day he submitted a substitute measure de
signed to avoid some of the objections made to it in
committee. The action of the Senator was well
enough as far as it went, but it did not go far enough.
He would have done better to have withdrawn his
bill altogether and applied for leave to file it in the
waste basket.
Not a single argument can be advanced in favor of
increasing the number of Harbor Commissioners to
five, which will not of itself raise up a stronger argu
ment against the proposition. It is doubtful whether
five men would constitute a more efficient commission
than a smaller number, but it is certain they would
draw more salaries and thereby lessen the amount of
money available for harbor purposes. Five men might
have more honesty than the lesser number, but it is
equally true they might have more corruption; and
while they might form a stronger body to oppose the
persistence of place-hunters, they are likely to have
more friends to reward and a larger number of hench
men to support.
The State of California has not only as many com
missions but as many commissioners as the taxpayers
are willing to support. A bill to increase the mem
bers on any salaried commission is just about as oH
jectionable as one to create a new commission. In
the one case as in the other there would be an increase
of expenditures for official salaries, and to that there
ir. a decided objection.
The only reform needed in the Harbor Commission
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1899.
is the enactment of some law by which members of
it can be brought to trial and punishment, if guilty, of
wasting the funds intrusted to their care, or of any
form of corruption in office. A recent official report
shows that in the construction of the ferry depot the
Harbor Commission then in office committed acts
which bear every evidence of mismanagement and
fraud, and yet the same report declares there is no
law under which the perpetrators of the wrong can
be punished. From facts set forth in the report con
clusive evidence can be drawn that we need more
laws, but neither in that report nor elsewhere are
there to be found any facts tending to the conclusion
that we need more commissioners.
THE MULLAN CLAIM VETO.
ONCE more Governor Gage has exercised the
veto power in a way that merits general ap
proval. He has refused his assent to a bill ap
propriating $45,616 30 to pay the notorious Mullan
claim against the State, which Assemblyman Johnson
succeeded in getting through the Legislature.
This claim, which has been persistently urged for a
long time, is without justification. The State is under
neither a legal nor a moral obligation to pay it. An
attempt was at one time made to obtain from the
courts a judgment in favor of the claim, but the courts
declared it invalid. Since then recourse has been had
to legislators, and with such success on the part of the
claimant that the State would have been a loser of that
amount of money had it not been for the Governor's
veto.
The full story of the claim was told in The Call on
Sunday, and it is not worth while to repeat. Suffice
it that John Mullan was appointed in 1882 by Gov
| ernor Perkins to collect from the General Govern
ment the amount of money due under the act pro
viding for the repayment to the various States the
I sums levied upon them by the direct war tax. The
appointment was ratified by the Legislature in 1883
and Mullan went to work. Two installments of the
tax were paid by the Government and Mullan received
his authorized commission on them. In fact upon
one of them he received more than the commission
due him. In 1888 his appointment was revoked on the
ground that his services were entirely unnecessary,
and the result confirmed that view of the case, for the
Government paid the balance due without delay.
Mullan now claims he is entitled to a 20 per cent
commission on the whole amount. The courts have
declared his appointment was illegal, and the facts
show that he was paid more than was really due him
on the amounts he collected. The Governor has
therefore acted in accordance with justice as well as
cf economy in vetoing the bill. He has checked a
heavy raid on the State treasury and deserves credit
for it.
A FREEZE OUT FOR NEW ORLEANS.
WHILE the recent cold wave in the East cov
ered an area extending from the Rocky Moun
tains to the Azores and from the St. Lawrence
River to Tampa Bay, carrying disaster to all sections
cf that wide expanse, its most grievous effects ap
pear to have been produced in Louisiana. In fact, it
was one of the features of the storm that it was
colder in the South than in the North, and when at
the extreme of its severity the temperature was lower
in Atlanta than in New York.
New Orleans was ready for her annual Mardi Gras
festival when the cold wave set in. The temperature
did not sink so low there as in Atlanta, but it sank
low enough to give that city the coldest day in its
history. The New Orleans Picayune says that for
four days in succession the residents of the city be
held the unwonted sight of vast floes of heavy ice
floating down the Mississippi River. The floes
passed on unmelted to the Gulf of Mexico, and pre
sented an extraordinary spectacle in the water of that
sea, which is largely within the tropics.
Of the effect upon the crops of the State the Pica
yune says: "Th,ere is little room to hope that the
orange trees have escaped practically total destruc
tion. Except where uncommonly well protected the
trees have probably been killed, and the result will be
that for several years to come the orange crop of this
State will be virtually nil. By far the most serious
consequence of the freeze has been the damage to
sugar interests. It is reported that the ground has
been frozen all the way from three to four inches be
low the surface, and that as a result much of the
stubble in the cane fields has suffered."
Concerning the effects of the blizzard upon
Mardi Gras the Picayune says little, but a correspon
dent of the Chicago Times-Herald, who attended the
festivities, reports that when the cold wave came it
had New Orleans completely at its mercy, and that
the Northern visitors suffered more than the natives,
for as they went South expecting to find sunshine and
tropic warmth they were equipped with thin suits,
light summer underwear and spring overcoats.
Against these adverse conditions, says the Times-
Herald, New Orleans hospitality, which is proverbial
for its warmth, struggled in vain. The city was
crowded, for the Mardi Gras of that city is the great
est of American festivals â indeed, one of the greatest
in the world, and draws visitors from all parts of the
continent. Clubs and private residences were
thrown open to the public, and everything in the
range of possibility was done to care for the visiting
multitudes. The grand processions were held as a
concession to the strangers who had come so far to
see them, but owing to the cold, the sleet and the
wind there was little pleasure to the spectators, and
all the enthusiasm of the frolic was expended at the
grand ball.
With such a record in the gayest of Eastern winter
resorts we ought to revive our midwinter festivals
and give pleasure-seekers in search of February sun
shine a place where they can be s*afe from blizzards.
A Mardi Gras in San Francisco would never be In
tenupted by storms of sleet, nor marked by the sight
of heavy ice floes drifting across the bay to the sta.
When President Jordan of Stanford University
stated that Mr. McKinley had put a fool in the Cab
inet he ought to have been more explicit.
Admiral Dewey had the advantage of not mixing
in any squabbles except of the dignified sort to be
settled by a few broadsides.
It is to be regretted that so many of the impas
sioned legislative remarks have to be represented
thus: !
It is well that Burns made a speech and thereby
surprised his following. He is likely to have so few
opportunities.
Â«
Murders in San Francisco would be less frequent if
the trap were to fall with greater frequency at San
Quentin.
If Sampson felt at liberty to express himself he
would probably refer to the other fellow as ''devilish
Schley."
The Post uses the headline, "Foul Play Sus
picioned." This is a worse fate than foul play de
serves.
CLEVER CAPTURE
OF A BRACE OF
COUNTERFEITERS
Caught in an Oakland
Cottage.
PART OF THE OUTFIT FOUND
GOOD WORK OF SECRET SERVICE
OFFICER BROWNE.
When Confronted With Evidence of
Their Guilt One of the Pris
oners Makes a Con
fession.
A counterfeiting 1 pcheme was cleverly
nipped in the bud in Oakland late yester
day afternoon by United States Secret
Service Officers Browne and Cronin, when
two men, giving their names as Amos H.
Vliet, aged :u years, and H. D. Pell, 44
years, were arrested on suspicion of coun
terfeiting.
They are charged with felony on tne
small book at the Oakland City Prison,
where they occupy separate cells. The of
ficers have possession of part of the out
fit, consisting of crucibles, metal, plaster
of paris and other appliances used by the
counterfeiters, also a bogus dollar.
About three weeks ago Vliet and Pell
rented the small cottage at 520 iorty
i fourth street. No furniture, however, was
j moved in. During the daytime the nouse
was deserted, but at night there was ac
tivity in one of the rear rooms and the
men usually remained up all night. There
was usually considerable hammering dur
ing the night and this attracted the at
tention of neighbors, who last Wednesday
notified the police that the place and its
occupants would bear watching.
Friday night Chief of Police Fletcher
had Officers Kahn and Pardee visit the
cottage at 520 Forty-fourth street, but
though the officers searched carefully they
found nothing aside from an old blanket
and a large valise. The counterfeiters,
moreover, did not put in an appearance
that night.
When Secret Service Officers Cronin and
Browne arrested the prisoners the latter
offered no resistance.
Pell has virtually confessed his connec
tion with the scheme. His story is that
of a man who, being unable to earn money
with which to secure the comforts of life,
decided to manufacture money.
Both prisoners claim to be from the I
East. Pell was raised in Kentucky,
while Vliet says he hails from New York.
They met in San Francisco four weeks |
ago. Vliet claims to be a carpenter, while j
Pell's occupation is given by him as a
piano tuner.
Both feigned reticence to reporters. ;
"Never mind, we don't care to talk to re
| porters about this affair at all," said
Vliet to a Call reporter. "We didn tdo |
anything wrong am. lived in that cot
tage because it was cheaper than living
In San Francisco. What kept us up late ;
at night was the fact that Pell usually
didn't get home until 11 o'clock or so. ,
He's a piano tuner and gives lessons, too,
and we can live here for 50 cents a day.
The officers found no money on me, for I
hadn't a bean."
Pell after a time admitted that it was j
their intention to manufacture counterfeit |
money. . _
"You see, as a matter of fact, we had
hardly got started," said Pell. "It was
more of an experiment, but it hadn't prov
ed a success thus far.
"The dollar the officers found might
have been dropped by me, but you see I'd
rather not talk about this business until i
I have engaged counsel. We only had a
little of the metal, only about half a ;
pound, and. as I tell you, it was simply j
an experiment."
Pell seemed very much concerned as to i
what court his case will bo tried before.
"If it is to be tried in San Francisco,"
he continued, "why. I have lots of ac
quaintances over there. I am a piano
tuner by occupation, but things have been
rather dull lately. I was born in Ken
tucky, and came to San Francisco nine
years ago. About four weeks ago I met
Vliet. He's a carpenter and he was hard
up, too, so we decided to rent a little
cottage over in Oakland, because it was
cheaper than living in San Francisco.
"What kind of coins did we propose to
make? Why, I suppose dollars, but as I
told you before we hadn't made any yet;
we were only experimenting."
There has been an unusually large
amount of spurious money in dimes and j
nickels, as well as dollars, turned into |
local circulation of late and the authori
ties feel confident that they now have be
hind the bars two men whom they believe !
are none other than clever counterfeiters. |
The accused counterfeiters are men of i
medium stature. Both have sandy mus- j
taches, and are anything but neat of per
sonal appearance. While apparently not I
endowed with an overabundance of intel
ligence, they evidently knew enough to
destroy some of the utensils used In their
enterprise, or at least hide them where
the officers have been unable to locate
them, for while the authorities secured
what they believe to be sufficient evidence
to convict, they have thus far failed to
discover any dies, milling apparatus or
hammers, the noise of which aroused the
suspicion of neighbors and led to their
capture.
Secret Service Officer Browne said:
"Some time ago we were informed that.
counterfeit halves and uuarters were be- ]
ing passed in San Jose. A little later there !
came to us a similar complaint from Oak
land, and mis in turn was followed by one
from San Francisco. The halves and
quarters were of a very superior kind and
quality.
"About ten days ago I received notice
from one of my special agents in Oakland I
that two strange men had rented a house
at 520 Forty-fourth street. The curiosity of !
the people living in the vicinity of this
house was attracted by the fact that a
light was kept burning nearly all night, j
and this, added to the additional fact that
no one seemed to know anything 1 of the
men, had aroused their suspicions. By
my orders the men were shadowed. They
came frequently to San Francisco and j
were largely in evidence in the tenderloin, j
Finally we decided that they were the
men we wanted and J. F. Cronin, one of
my deputies, and myself made the arrest.
"The men were gTeatly surprised when |
we informed them that we were Federal
officers, and that we wanted to search the
premises. At first they denied being
counterfeiters or having any counterfeit i
paraphernalia. After considerable ques- |
tionlng, in which I managed to tangle
them up. Vliet confessed that they had
been making counteneit dollars. We re
covered a crucible that they melted
their metal in and also some plaster of
paris, which they used for making molds.
I also have in my possession a sample of
one of the counterfeit dollars that was
made by them. It is light in weight and
the lettering is crudely done, but other
wise it is a good counterfeit anu could be
passed. We found in the house a small
brick oven that had been built In one of
the rooms. The men wore using coke in
this, which fact in itself is very suspi
cious. I am not certain yet that these are
the men who have been operating in San
Jose. Oakland and this city. There is at
present in circulation in San Francisco a
counterfeit nickel that is an excellent im
itation."
CAPTAIN BABNES RECOVERING.
Ex-District Attorney Had a Narrow
Escape From a Serious Attack
of Pneumonia.
Captain William S. Barnes. ex-District
Attorney, has just passed through an or
deal dangerously close to dread pneumo
nia. For forty-eight hours Dr. McGettl
gan, the attending physician, was very
doubtful as to the result of the conges
tion which affected the patient's lungs.
Fortunately the attack was less severe
than was anticipated and the captain is
now safely on the road to recovery.
Dr. McGettigan thinks all danger is
past, unless a relapse occurs. Every pro
caution will be taken to insure convales
cence, as Captain Barnes' physique is
such that pneumonia would almost cer
tainly prove fatal.

NEWS OF FOEEIGN NAVIES.
Armstrong & Whitworth, at Newcastle,
have the exclusive order of supplying guns
and gun-mounts for all the ships buiiding
lin Europe for the Japanese navy. These
! contracts aggregate about $10,000,000.
The Freya, a German second-class
cruiser of 5650 tons, is ready for sea. She
made 20 knots with 10,500 horsepower.
Three sister ships, named Hertha, Victo
ria Luise and Vlneta, are approaching
completion.
The Russian admiralty has given a con
tract for ten torpedo-boat destroyers to
the Belgian Shipbuilding: Company
at Nicolaieff and Bellino-Foudench at
Odessa. They are to be completed within
two years, and are intended for the Pa
cific squadron, whither they will be sent
in parts on the steamers of the volun
teer rleet, and put together either at Port
Arthur or at Vladivostok.
The French cruiser Protet, of 4065 tons
displacement, built by contract at Bor
deaux, has passed through her steam
trials. Under full power the engines de
veloped 9300 horsepower and a speed of 20
knots, exceeding the contract by 300 horse
power and one knot. During the twenty
four-hour trial under two-third power the
engines developed 6500 horsepower, and the
coal consumption was only 1.7 pounds.
The German battle-ship Kaiser Fried
rich lllâ the first of five new shipsâ has
been completed, and made a speed of IS
knots under full power, the engines giv
ing 13.500 horsepower. She was designed
to make 18 knots with 13,000 horsepower,
and while the speed has been realized
there appears to be a waste of power. She
was begun In 1596 at Wllhelmshafen, is
11,130 tons displacement and is reported to
have cost $3,530,000.
Of the forty-eight ships of the German
navy in commission twenty-three are on
foreign stations. Of this number ten are
in the Pacific, five on the African coast,
two in Brazilian waters, two in the Medi
terranean, two in the West Indies and two
training ships are cruising. Only two ar
mored ships, the Deutschland and Kaiser,
are in commission abroad and the greater
number of vessels on stations away from
home are small cruisers and gunboats.
Lord Beresford has no confidence in sub
marine beats, and is quoted as saying:
"It is quite useless as a fighting machine,
owing to the necessary absence of morale
among a crew, which would be in a blue
funk c.f it all the time." The probability
is that partly submerged boats â on the
line of the Nordenfelt, which exposes only
a small surfaceâ will prove of more prac
tical utility and be more remunerative
to the Inventor.
The Hongkong and Whampoa Dock
Company has declined to accept the re
sponsibility of docking the British bat
tle-ship Victorious, the very sufficient rea
son being given that there is only six
inches to spare at the dock entrance. It
is not likely that the naval authorities
will dock the ship on their own responsi
bility, and the Victorious will probably be
detached from the China station and or
dered home and another armored ship of
less gigantic dimensions substituted. The
Victorious has a beam of 75 feet, while the
Oregon, now on her way to Manila, has
only 69 feet beam and draws about two
feet less water than the British battle
ship, and the Oregon will, therefore, ex
perience no difficulty in docking and thus
maintain her efficiency.
There are two 11-inch Krupp puns in the
Kimpai forts near Fuchau, which until
two years ago were in perfect condition.
The Chinese general at that time attempt
ed to experiment with a lot of Chinese
cracker powder, made to imitate the
proper prismatic powder, and ordered one
of the guns fired with a full charge of
352 pounds. The first charge strained the
gun so that the breech-block could not
be opened. Instead of taking warning
by this he ordered the other gun to be
fired, and the result was that the breech
was blown to the rear, killing- about twen
ty soldiers. The Chinese did not like to
lose both guns, and they were sent to the
Shanghai arsenal, where new screw
breeches were made, and on January 10
last both guns were fired with full charges
and the guns stood the strain.
France is building a number of com
merce destroyers, one of which, named
Guichen. is ready for her steam trials.
She is 8277 tons, about 900 tons larger than
the Columbia and Minneapolis of the
United States navy, and is to make a
speed of 23 knots. The ship was built by
contract at St. Nazaire, begun in October,
1895, launched Octoer 27, 1897. and her con
tract cost is $3,059,725. The series of trials
include three hours under full power to
develop 24,000 horsepower and 23 knots,
subject to penalties tor failure of speed
and excess of coal consumption, the ship
to be rejected if the speed falls to reach
21 knots. Next in order is a trial of twen
ty-four hours' durations with fire under
twenty-six of her thirty-six boilers, to de
velop 14,500 horsepower, and a fine of $30
per gramme of coal per horsepower con
sumed in excess of contract stipulations.
The series of trials conclude with eight
hours under 19,000 horsepower and a like
period under SSOO. The Guichen is fitted
with three screws and has a bunker ca
pacity of 1460 tons, calculated to give her
a steaming radius of 10,000 miles at a speed
of ten knots.
By the end of December, 1899, the British
navy will have in hand no less than six
teen battle-ships and twelve armored
cruisers in course of construction or com
pletion. Contracts for four battle-ships
cf 14,000 tons each were recently given out,
two going to the Thames Iron Works, one
to Laird and the fourth to Palmer's. Of
the twelve armored cruisers, eight are
already in course of building and three
have been contracted for at Fair-field,
Clydebank and at Barrows, and a fourth
is to be built at the Pembroke Dockyard.
The armored cruisers will be of 14.100 tons.
30,000 horsepower and have a speed of 23
knots. These eight ships represent 112,
--400 tons. 196,000 horsepower, and a cost,
exclusive of armament, of $40,000,000.
BESTOWAL OF
THE BRUCE MEDAL
To the eminent German scientist. Dr.
Arthur Auwers, the Bruce gold medal has
been recently awarded for distinguished
services to astronomy. This artistic token
of recognition, of which the Astronomical
Society of the Pacific is the trustee, was
awarded for the first time a year ago,
the recipient then being Professor Simon
Newcomb of "Washington. Dr. Auwers la
a native of Gottingen and is now in his
sixty-first year. For some time he was
connected with the observatory of Kon
igsberg, but since 1866 has been in the
Royal Observatory of Berlin and is sec
retary of the Academy of Sciences of that
rity. Many years ago he received the gold
medal of the Royal Astronomical Society
of London and also the Watson medal
from the Academy of Sciences of Wash
ington. These were bestowed chiefly in
recognition of his valuable work In the
calculation of stellar positions and mo
tions. With tireless zeal he has unrav
eled the abstruse complexities of stellar
parallax, stardrift, and the orbits of dou
ble stars, and according to Newcomb.
who is particularly qualified to form an
estimate of his labors, is a model investi
gator, and in industry and precision the
foremost of German astronomers. Among
the Important works published by Auwers
are four volumes on the Germa- observa
tions of the transit of Venus, and the re
roduction of Bradley's observations,
which latter has been invaluable to Struve
and other astronomers who have calcu
lated the apex of the sun's way. In a gra
cious letter of acceptance received a few
days ago Dr. Auwers expresses approval
of the method in which the selection of a
Bruce medallist is made, and also his
gratification in sharing the honor con
ferred previously on the eminent Ameri
can scientist, Professor newcomb.

CHINESE FAVORED.
A Honolulu Merchant Complains of
the Action of Commanders of
United States Vessels.
To the Editor of the San Francisco
j Callâ Sir: I would like to call your at
| tention to a state of affairs, which I
think is not generally known even in . a
i small city, much less on the coast. I am
a constant reader of The Call, and the at-
I titude of that paper toward the hinese
lis well known. One of the great objec
) tions offered to annexation was the Chi
â  nese population in this country, and we
! constantly hear the cry "The Chinese
Must Go." Yet every American warship
â  and troopship Is supplied with stores by
! the Chinese, to the utter exclusion of
1 white traders. I, myself, have been re
fused permission to go on board a trans
i port, while a Chinaman walked up the
'â  gangplank at the same time. About ten
clays ago, when the Morgan City ar
â¢â  rived I boarded her as soon as she came
j alongside the wharf and submitted my
â  price list to the steward, who informed
Ime that the prices were lower than he
| paid last trip. He took me to the cap
-1 tain who was also satisfied, and told
Ime as it was late, to come down the
first thing in the morning and he would
give me the order. On going on board
,In the morning I was informed that tne
1 order had been handed to a Chinaman.
j I naturally felt disappointed, and asked
:if his prices were lower than mine. The
steward said. "No; not as low." I again
called on the captain, who in a very
pompous manner told me, '"Sir, lean pat
ronize the devil If I want to. If the ed
itor of The Call was in Honolulu for six
I months he would see that the Chinese
! are here to stuy, and that his own coun
: trvmen are the ones to help him. No

SULLIVAN TO
OPEN A HOTEL
IN NEW YORK
Will Soon Abandon
the Stage.
A HOME FOR BACHELORS
NOVEL SCHEME WHICH JOHN
THINKS HIGHLY OF.
Intends to Conduct an Apartment-
House With Restaurant Attached,
Though He Admits He Is
Off on Cooking.
John' L. Sullivan has decided to retire
from the stage, at least he so stated last
night, and will, after he has closed his
present theatrical season, open a small
hotel in New York on the "stag" plan, as
he describes it. He says the theatrical
profession in a lucrative sense Is a thing
of the past, and that there is more money
in renting rooms and looking after the
comforts of bachelor sports In New York
than there is in treading the boards and
being responsible for the salaries of twen
ty-six actors and actresses at the end of
each week.
"It is just this way," said John, "when
I return to New York I am going to quit
the stage for good, because thore
i-s nothing doing. I have carefully
considered a plan to run a hotel
on the European plan for bach
elors only. I will give them a
room for a dollar a day and then If they
want It I will have a restaurant in con
nection with the place to give them a
good breakfast in the morning for 50
cents. I am a little to the bad on -cooking
myself, but I will get a swell chef who
will give them a breakfasr for ,30 cent 3
that will skin the other restaurants to
death.
"I am out of politics for good and will
give others a chance in that line, and will
devote my whole time to the hotel busi-
Just fancy the number of steamers
that arrive in Now York in one week, and
when the world knows that I have opened
a hotel you bet I will get my share of
transient guests."
Sullivan leaves early this morning for
Banta Cruz and regrets that he will be un
to attend the Smith-Lavigne fight,
which he states will be a great contest.
He thinks it is a very even match, and

AT PARK AND BEACH.
Immense Crowds at the Various
Pleasure Resorts.
The park and ocean beach swarmed
with pleasure-seekers from early morn
ing till long after nightfall last evening,
and it would be hard to decide which por
tion of the day was the most enjoyable.
During the day, unless one sought the
shelter of foliage, the sun was almost too
warm for comfort, while at nifht the air
was soft and balmyâ such a day as rarely
comes to San Francisco. Vehicles of every
description filled the roadways, while the
bicycle paths were fairly alive witii
wheels.
Four accidents marred the day and
forcibly reminded the park police that
a certain class of riders must be brought
up with a short turn. On Sundays a
certain class of young men and boys in
vade the park on wheels and the minute
they are out of sight of the police tney
dash heedlessly along the paths, or coast
down the grades to the imminent danger
of pedestrians. There are ordinances
r. sulating the speed of bicyclists and pro
:g coasting in the park, and to tne
credit of the clubmen and regular riaers
they scrupulously respect the law, but
with the casual riders it is different, and
the accident to Mrs. W. B. "Webster is
the result.
At the Chutes another large crowd was
gathered. The balloon ascension and
parachute drop by Emil Markeberg be
ing the principal attraction. The daring

Sermon on Thomas Caxlyle.
Rev. William Rader of the Third Con
gregational Church delivered a sermon on
â¢'Thomas Carlyle, a Calvlnistic Skeptic,"
last evening. Introductory to the sermon
the speaker briefly reviewed the lives of
other authors â Hume, Burns, Scott and
Shakespeareâ and compared the produc
tions of their pens with the genius of
Carlyle. Continuing he said:
"This writer possessed a satirical vein
extraneous to other authors. He became
famous shortly after the appearance of
his essays in Frasier's Magazine in 1838.
In these he convinced people of his re
formatory nature, and later in his
sketches on the French revolution he laid
the leaders of the French factions on the
griddle, exposing their personal charac
ters and the motives which prompted
their action in the struggle. He was re
ligious but was also skeptical. His
views were always expressed with entire
frankness and with little heed of the re
sult. It is said that once while in the
presence of Queen Victoria he remarked:
"Pardon me if I sit, as I can always talk
better while sitting."
The speaker concluded by saying that
it might be well if the shade of Carlyle
could invade the halls of legislation at
mento and teach a lesson of right
eousness and honesty among the lawmak
ers there assembled.
Entertain Officers and Sailors.
A most enjoyable time is anticipated at
the "i'oung Men's Christian Association
to-morrow evening 1 , when large numbers
of cftioers and men of the United States
battle-ship lowa will be entertained by
the reception committee. Complimentary
cards of invitation and reserved seats

ONLY A CALIFORNIA
SUN COULD DO THIS
CELLULOID IGNITED BY A GLASS CASE.
gg fTJHE Fire Department received a shock yesterday about the noon hour m
0 I when an alarm came In from Taylor and Market streets. An excited $
m* I citizen saw a blaze seemingly coming from the center of the Wein- Â£*
& â¢*- stock & Lubin dry goods store, and he rushed to the first fire box in the O
83 vicinity and began working the lever which costs the city a lot of money S
8 every time it is pulled. When the section of the department assigned to that Â§
0 part of the town arrived it hunted for evidences of a fire, and hunted in Â§
*? vain. &
Â£Â£ '-^ \ But there was a fire. "Weinstock & Lubln had arranged an artistic array 'fit
S3 of celluloid goods in a show case on the outside of their store. "Without tak- 2?
Â£ ing any thermometrical measurements of the intensity of a California sun's 8
25 rays during March weather they negligently left the case unshaded and ex- So
*5 posed to the fierce beating of the world's great luminary. â d
25 At first there was a sizzling, then a melting and finally a bursting forth of 88
Â£> flame. The paper decorations and the entire stock in the case were fast dis- <&
80 appearing from heat effects when one of the neighbors, armed with hammer 88
Â§f and chisel, broke open the case and saved the big brick building from pos- <Â£

Mad Act of a Love
lorn Youth.
ARRESTED AFTER A FIGHT
HARRY LEIGHTON CREATES A
SCENE IN A HOTEL.
Failing to IndueÂ© Ethel Hall to Be
come His Wife He Robs Her
of Her Dia
monds.
Armed with a revolver Harry Lelghton,
a well-dressed young man, last night vis
ited the partments of Ethel Hall at the
Silver State House on Mason street with
the avowed intention of compelling her to
marry him or making her a subject for j
the Coroner. The fair Ethel was seated I
on a lounge conversing wun two other
women when the bloodthirsty youth en
tered. Raising his revolver on a level
with the young woman's head Leighton
demanded to know if she had considered
his proposition of marriage.
"You cannot escape me this time," he
remarked, with a tinge of anger in his
tone. "Consent to become my wife or I
will kill you."
With a wild scream the thoroughly
frightened woman rolled off the lounge,
while her two companions ran from the
room shrieking for help.
The manager of the hotel, fearing that
murder was being committed, hastened
to the room to rind Leighton standing over
the prostrate form of Miss Hall. As he
entered the room Leighton , with an oath,
turned his revolver on him after threat
ening to riddle him with bullets unless he
beat a hasty retreat. Thinking that the
love-smitten youth would not hesitate to
carry his threat into execution, the man
ager went in search of a policeman. He
soon discovered Officers Fennell and Wil
son, who, after hearing the story, lost no
time in reaching the hotel.
Leighton had disappeared, but the
woman was found lying on the floor of
her room, momentarily fearing that he
would return and kill her.
To the officers the woman said that
after her two friends had rushed from
the room Leighton, who still covered her
with the revolver, seized her left hand
and dragged three rings from her fingers.
He then left, after threatening to return j
and murder her if she reported the oc
currence to the police.
After leaving the house Leighton went
to a saloon on O'Farrell street, where he
wrote a note to Miss Hall, demanding of !
her to meet him, and threatening to kill I
her if she refused. The note was turned i
over to the policemen and they at once |
started for the saloon. Leightnon was
found seated at a table in the act of
writing another note to the woman. Of
ficer Wilson, who knew him, accosted
him and told him he was under arrest.
Jumping from his sent Leighton at
tempted to reach for the revolver, but
was quickly overpowered. He was taken I
to the City Prison, where he was charged ;
with carrying a concealed weapon. The ;
rings which he had taken from Miss Hall j
were found In his possession. The police
say that Leighton's attack on the woman
was precipitated by her informing him
that she was tired of him and intended to
return to her parents in San Jose.
Trinity Presbyterian Church.
Trinity Presbyterian Church enjoyed an
unusually refreshing service yesterday,
j when the attendance of worshipers was
very large. The occasion was the observ
i ance of the Lord's Supper, which was ad
; ministered by the pastor. Rev. Dr. Car
son, whose remarks were of a very inter
esting and impressive character, as mi
i deed were all the other exercises. Twenty
new members were received, nine by let
i ters from sister churches and eleven on
i profession of their faith. Two of the lat
ter were baptized, their baptism in ln
i fancy having beÂ«n neglected.

ATTORNEYS FOR
THE CHINAMEN
GET THE MONEY
Steps Taken to Stop
Illegal Fishing.
DEPUTIES ARE INNOCENT
COMMISSIONERS SATISFIED OF
THEIR HONESTY.
Shrimp Fishing May Be Stopped lor
a Stated Period Each Year in
Order to Protect
Fry.
The depletion of the fine marketable
fish in San Francisco and San Pablo bays
by the Chinese shrimp fishers has aroused
the State Fish Commission, and if their
plans do not miscarry some salient
j changes will soon be made in the existing
I fish laws of this State.
Last Friday morning The Call published
an account of the arrest of five Chinamen
engaged in illegal fishing, and the leader
confessed to a payment of money to se
cure immunity from interference by the
authorities while occupied in his lawless
acts.
Alexander T. Vogelsang, who has lately
been appointed a member of the commis
sion, and has displayed great energy In
the prosecution of his duties as Commis
sioner, is full of hope for an improvement
of present conditions.
"I think the officer who made the arrest
last Thursday should be congratulated,"
he said. "If the authorities would enforce
the law against the abuses brought about
by shrimp fishing we would not suffer
from the scarcity of marketable fish. The
only genuine way to save the fish is to
close the shrimp fishing during certain
months in the year. That will cut off the
supply during these months, but some
thing of this sort must be done. During
the drying season great quantities of
shrimps are sent to China, enough to sup
ply this coast for the entire year."
In regard to the alleged corruption of
deputies of the commission Mr. Vogelsang
said: "I have heard that Chinese mer
chants have paid their attorneys monthly
tolls on boats in order to be frai from
molestation while they caught young fioh
at the same time they did their Phrirap
fishing. I am positive the deputies are
j honest and no corruption exists among
them. If any money has been paid by tho
Chinese it has been paid to their attor
neys, who secure all exactions for them
selVes. At any rate I have not been able
to detect any crookedness among the dep
uties and I have investigated the matter
I thoroughly."
L>cores the Ring Contests.
"Why More Men Do Not Go to Church"
was Dr. Charles Edward Locke's subject
last evening at the Central Methodist
Episcopal Church. Dr. Locke referred to
reasons in the church itself why men do
; not attend, such as inconsistencies
I among some of the membrrs, impractical
â  sermons, etc. He then found reasons for
i which the men themselves are responsi
ble, such as indifference, overwork during
the week, Sunday labor and Sunday
pleasure, the lives and business meth
ods of some men which make the church
distasteful, the saloon and drink habit
and all kinds of licensed vices. Continu
ing. Dr. Locke said:
"If you still ask me why more men do
not go to church, I must remind you of
all the satanlc influences at work, espe
cially in the cities, to destroy men. When
a man gets into the viselike grip of a bad
habit he does not care for the church;
some men are ashamed to go to church.
Thu man who frequents the saloon, the
gambling table, the brothel, or the prize
tight, is not often seen In the church.
When a man is rendering faithful serv
ice to the devil he makes himself believe
that there is no sin. no God, no heaven,
and no hell. He tries to ridicule the
church.
"The ring contests which are being held
every week in our city are training our
youth for San Quentin and the gallows,
it is high time that righteous men should
make themselves heard, and that good
and brave men shall be elevated to of
fice who will give to San Francisco such
a government as will put a premium n n
virtue and manhood and honor. At the
present time the city and authorities ap
pear to be held up by Sabbath-breakers,
me whisky power and corrupt politi
cians."

"When a physician discovers, studies or classifies a disease his name is
given to it by his fellow doctors. They think that in this way they pay him
a compliment, although the discoverer need not have found a cure for the dis-
ease. Dr. Richard Bright, an Englishman, is condemned to a sad immortality
-which associates his name with a terrible disorder of the kidneys. Bright's
disease appears in several forms, it springs from several causes and the
older works on medicine positively declare it to be incurable.
To say that a man has Bright's disease was once considered equivalent
to saying that he stood in the valley of the shadow of death. The end was
only a question of time. But that was before Warner's Safe Cure had spread
its benefits over the land. The story of C. H. Lincoln of Medford.Mass., shows
how this wonderful medicine raised a man from his sick bed, even when his
closest friends believed they were hoping against hope.
Mr. Lincoln says:
"I had typhoid fever and after it came kidney trouble. I tried a dozen
doctors and still grew worse. After taking doctors' medicine enough to sink
a ship I heard it whispered around that I had Bright's disease of the kid-
neys. I knew what that meant, so I pitched the medicine I had outdoors.
I then bought one bottle of Warner's Safe Cure and took it according to
directions. The first bottle gave me relief and I bought a second. Before
that was gone I had gained nearly ten pounds. I continued taking Safe Cure
and it cured mf.
"I am fifty-nine years old and enjoy as good health as any man of my
age. If any one has kidney trouble and Warner's Safe Cure will not cure
him nothing this side of the grave will. I believe it the best and only cure
for kidney disease on earth."
Mr. Lincoln is a veteran fireman with a wide acquaintance in Medford.
Unconsciously he makes a valuable suggestion to sufferers from kidney dis-
ease. Do not wait until you have taken "medicine enough to sink a ship."
May be in the course of your investigations you will light on a good remedy
you never heard of before. But probabilities are all against it.
Nowhere does the proverb "Delays are dangerous" apply with such force
as in kidney derangement. When Bright's disease has set in the kidney
tissue is breaking down and passing away every minute. The strength of the
body is sapped steadily, surely.
Inasmuch as Warner's Safe Cure alone stops kidney degeneration, should
it not be used without an hour's delay when pain in the back and head, a
cold skin and bad digestion give unmistakable warnings?

In popular favor. Nearly five thou

and witnessed some of the

months.
The sensational course between H. A.

Thompson's Lowlander caused intense ex
it in the betting ring and grand
stand. The hare 1- d the dogs once up
the Reid and then sharply turned and
took his pursuers past the grandstand
times and dropped as if heart
stricken, und was placed out of danger
by Field Steward Mcllugh. During the
piueilng course, Billy Thompson, one of
wners of Lowlander. tried to pre
his dog from continuing the race,
but without success. Bettors and'specta
like appealed to Judge Grace to let

pr< vi nted him doing so.
When the race ended the score stood 26

for the course was 5 minutes and 18 sec-
Fox Kenny was carried off the
field and was withdrawn by his owner.
Lowlander managed to walk off, but
showed the effects of his long run.
Thornhill was put out by Maud S in
the ar?t round. While his defeat occa
sioned some surprise, experts seem to
think that Thornhill had not recupirat-d
from her hard courses for the Grace cup
on the previous Sunday at another park.
The running of Tommy Rex astounded
coursing men. .On Saturday he ran a I
minute-and-45-srconds course and after
the kill picked up another "jack" and ran
it all over the field. Yesterday he went
out and beat Wild Tralee and was barely
put out by Cavalier in the second round.

THE BAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1899.
MONEY FOR THE
TROOPS IN THE
PHILIPPINES
Sailing of the Trans
port Valencia.
PAYMASTER COFFIN'S CHARGE
A MILLION AND A HALF IN COIN
GOES OUT.
Horrible Suicide of Steward McKenna
of the Puebla While Suffering
From Delirium Tremens.
Visitors to the lowa.
Yesterday afternoon the United States
transport Valencia sailed for Manila, by
way of Honolulu, carrying thirteen army
officers and a detachment of troops, to be
distributed among the regiments sta
tioned in the Philippines. The officers
were Major Eugene Coffin, Surgeon Rob
ert J. McAdory and Second Lieutenants
Munton, Minus, Bushfield, Bundill. Si
monds, Kerr, Herron, Way, Merry, Har
ris and Foster. The eleven second lieu
tenants are this year's graduates from
Weft Point, on their way to take their
baptism of fire in the jungles. Ordinarily
they would have graduated in June, but
by a special act of Congress they were
"rushed" out of the cadet-gray into the
army-blue and sent out to Manila ahead
of the six regiments that will soon be
transported to that warm field of action.
Major Coffin's baggage Is about the
most valuable that any officer has car
rind out to the front from this port. It
is worth something like J1.500,000, and con
sists of gold and silver coin. The major
is a paymaster, and with the exception
of Jio.ooo he will leave with the soldiers
at Honolulu he will distribute all the mill
ion and a half among the troops in the
Philippines. Major Coffin was an officer
in the Twentv-thlrd Ohio Infantry dur
ing the Civil War, a lieutenant In Captain
William McKinley's company. He re
entered the service at the first call to
arms of his old commander and has re
turned from Cuba to go to distant Ma
nila.
The transport Puebla arrived in this
port early yesterday morning, thirty clays
from Manila, including a stay of six days
at Nagasaki, Japan. She brought as pas
sengers a number of Invalid soldiers, six
sailors from the cruiser Boston, en route
home for discharge, and two volunteer
army officers, Lieutenants Goodale and
Wadley. the latter a resident of Los An
geles. Miss West, a Red Cross nurse, was
also a passenger on the Pueblo.
The only incident of note which trans
pired on the run across the Pacific was
the horrible suicide of Chief Steward John
McKenna at sea a few days out from
Nagasaki. He went on a spree in the
Japanese port, the wind-up of a long
drinking bout in Manila, which resulted
In an attack of delirium trenuns. By or
ders of Captain H. C. Thomas, the man
was placed under restraint in his room
and attended by Surgeon George H.
Strowbridge, the ship's surgeon. He asked
to have his curtains drawn that his room
might be darkened, and a few hours af
terward the attendant saw blood issuing
from under his door. When the door was
opened McKenna was discovered stabbing
himself in a savage manner in the throat
with a corkscrew. He had punctured his
larynx and windpipe six or seven tinif-s.
When the instrument was wrencned from
him he tried to tear the wounds with his
lingers, and was with difficulty prevented
from completing his self-destruction with
his naked hands. He died the noxt day,
February 20, and was buried at sea on the
22d. McKenna was about 40 years old and
well known In this city and in the Pacific
Coast steamship service.
The Pwebla had rather more than her
share of*crazy people on board during her
trip. James Jameson, a sailor, belonging
to the steamer, became crazy and had to
be kept in irons. He was violent at times
and will be examined by the Lunacy Com
mission. Another man, a passenger, nam
ed Wilson, drank himself into a demented
state at Nagasaki and was a general
nuisance for a portion of the time. The
Puebla Will probably be returned to
Manila with a load of soldiers and muni
tions of war.
The battleship lowa in popularity bids
fair to rival the Oregon in this port. Yes
terday afternoon six or seven tugs and
launches were busy carrying visitors out
to the big white ship. They wore re
ceived on board by the officers and crew,
who vied with one another in pointing out
the objects of interest to the strangers.
First the guests were shown the four mas
sive 12-inchers that helped beat down the
Viscaya, the 8-inchers that disabled the
Maria Teresa, and the 4-lnchers that
wrecked the Spanish torpedo boats at
Santiago do Cuba. They were also snown

SHELL MOUND PARK.
Twentieth Annual Opening of the
Favorite Pleasure Besort.
Captain L. Siebo, proprietor of Shell
Mound Park, opened the well-known
pleasure resort yesterday for the present
season of 1899. It was the twentieth an
niversary of these events, for the captain
has spent a large part of his life in the
same place, endeavoring to please the
public. During the past week or more
he hns sent to the officers of the many
charitable and fraternal organizations of
this city and Oakland upward of 1000
tickets of admission and the response was
liberal, almost that number of invitations
being accepted.
The day was all that the pleasure seek
ers could desire and, judging from ap
pearances, all had an enjoyable time.
Dancing was the order of the day, both
big pavilions being crowded with danc
ers until the late trains started for home.
HUMAN CRUELTY HIS TEXT.
Interesting Sermon Before the Cal
varian Society by *cv. T. A.
Caraher.
"Human Cruelty" was the subject of an
interesting and instructive address
ered yesterday afternoon by Rev. T. A.
Caraher before the Calvarian society. Tne
theme was drawn from the Biblical text,
"Then, therefore, Pilate took Jesus and
scourged him, and the soldiers, making a
crown of thorns, put it on his head.
The speaker emphasized the idea of yie
cruelty of the generation of to-day toward
the Redeemer. Every thought, he said,
should be of Him in preference to the
world. Worldly ambitions should always
be subjected to that extent that we
should think of God not only in the hour
of adversity, but in the hour of prosperity.
Our passions should be mastered and a
love and practice of virtue made a sud-
Stitute for the gratification of passions.
At the Cathedral In the evening the mis
sion under the direction of the Redemp
torist Fathers was concluded impressive
ly with the administration of a Papal
blessing to all those of the congregation
who had faithfully kept it.
CHANGES IN RELIGION.
Rev. R. Mackenzie Compares Old and
New Methods of Reform.
Rev. R. Mackenzie of the First Presby
terian Church delivered the first of a se
ries of lectures last night on the
"Changes in the Protestant Religion."
"Fundamental changes have taken
place in the Protestant religion in late
years," he said, "that have come by evo-
lution. and not revolution. The days of
conclave an<l council, by which sweeping
changes were made, have passed. The
changes which are now wrought are due
to natural development of life in the
heart of the church, and not by art or
artifice. These minor innovations are un
noticed at the time, but their accumula
tion makes a great change."
FEUDNER AND NORMAN
WERE "HIGH GUNS"
OPENING OF THE CALIFORNIA
WING CLUB SHOOT.
The Contest for Golden Trophies
Will Be Decided on
the First Sunday in
September.
Members of the California Wing Shoot-
Ing Club swung into line at the Olympic
Gun Club grounds yesterday and opened
the battle for honor, gold and golden
trophies. The crack 3of this crack, club
loaded their weapons, donned -un shades
for the interesting contest and 'he game
opened.
Jack Fanning, who has made l:nown to
all the sporting world the existence of the
Olympic Gun Club, was first to face the
traps. The trap lifted and this expert
had slain the first bird of the contest.
Fanning phot at thirty-one yards, a
handicap of three yards over him being
enjoyed by his opponents, but ho would
not have it otherwise. In Eastern and
international contests Fanning takes the
thirty-one-yard mark, and much shooting
at a lesser distance might result in con
fusing his calculations. So he stayed at
tlie farther mark. C. A. Ilaight, at
twenty-eight yards, as were all other con
testants, was second at the traps. From
Haight down the line-up stood: L.. D.
Owens, C. P. Grant, F. Vernon, IT. Ver
non, A. Rose, A. M. Shields, J. J. Sweeney,
C. C. Nauman, W. H. Williamson, H. F.
Wagner, I. R. D. Grubb, J. Kullman and
Otto Feudnrr.
In this aggregation of experts Fanning
fell behind, hut his records, established
in past matches, was sufficient to call
forth various explanations as to how he
failed to hold "high gun." Fanning, out
of 12 birds got 10, using a second on 9
occasions. Haight winged 9, Owens 10,
Grant 8. F. Vernon 9, H. Vernon 4. Roos
S Shields 10, Sweeny 11, Nauman 12, Wil
liamson 10. Wagner 11. Grubb 3, Coleman
7 Fay stopped 3, after which he withdrew;
Kullman 8 and Otto Feudner 12.
Feudner and Nauman, it will be seen,
held "high guns." each killing his alloted
number. To win a trophy, three of which
arÂ« hung up as incentives to good marks
manship, "high guns" must be held once
a month, or rather a majority of months
between now and September, on the first
Sunday of which the final shoot will be
held. , , ,
At the conclusion of the medal shoot a
sweepstakes of six birds for $2 50 a corner
was shot off with the following result:
Fanning 5, Fuedner 6. Nauman 6, Coleman
5, F. Vernon 5, Haight 6, Burrell 6, Roos
5, H. Kullman 3, Holby 3, Wagner 6 and
Williamson 4.

bers of the union who departed on the

printing at Manila. The cablegram re
qu.-stiiis that printers be sent was re
ceived only a couple of days ago, but the
matter was handled so promptly by
Colonel Long that the boys were on
board, bag and bagpage, ready to com
mence the trip yesterday. The colonel ex
erted every effort in their behalf and pre
sented himself at the wharf, that he
might attend personally to things per

B. H. ROBERTS
President Nye Talks
of Mormonism.
SAYS POLYGAMY IS DEAD
DECLARES THE CHURCH IS OUT
OF POLITICS.
Representative of the Latter Bay
Saints Claims the TJtah Congress
man Was Elected by Votes
of Gentiles.
President E. 71. Nye of the California
Mission of the Latter-Day Saints
preached to a very large assemblage In
Pythian Castle last right. It had been
announced that he would reply to the at
tacks being made on the church because
at the election to Congress from Utah of
B. H. Roberts, a Mormon and the hus
band of a plurality of wives, and this fact
undoubtedly was in a large measure re
ptile for the big attendance.
The speaker repudiated the allegation
that the Mormon church is in politics or
that it was in any way responsible for the
election of Roberts. He also denied that
polygamy was being or had been prac
ticed in Utah since the passage of the
Edmunds-Tucker act or that there was
any desire whatever among the members
of the church for a resumption of the
practice. He did not deny that there were
members of the church who had more
than one wife, but claimed that in every
such instance the plural marriages had
heen contracted pre% - ious to the act re
ferred to. and argued that it would be a
crime for the husbands of these women
to refuse to provide for them. Roberts
was one of them, ar.d he was doing just
what any man deserving to be called such
would do. That portion of President
Nye'a address referring to Roberts was
in substance as follows:
"In view of the fact that so many hard
things have recently been published about
the Saints, and tne further fact that the
newspapers have absolutely refused to
pub!:sh anything In our favor, I propose
to tell you some facts in relation to the
matter. The election of B. H. Roberts as
Congressman from Utah has stirred the
nation to its depths. There have been
:. misters al lover the land
and the "ministers have given expr
lr views, lavishly and recklessly.
â¢., too, have held mass meetings
;rpose of denouncing Roberts
and the church. Not that I depreciate the
-. th<?re are but few sections of the
country where women are appreciated as
they are In Utah. We have given them
the franchise and a woman is a member
of our State Senate; so we are certainly
at the forefront on this question.
"Some twenty-odd State Legislatures
have felt called upon to appeal to Con-
Roberts to take
it. Just remember that these grand
old solons, these wise old men, have done

had entered into an agreement with the

more than his record. ThÂ»y cried,

A MURDEROUS BEGGAR
FLOURISHES A KNIFE
Thomas Murphy Arrested for Begging
and Assault With a Deadly
Weapon.
THE vile abuse heaped upon re
spectable citizens by beggars on
their refusal to give them
money has been the subject of
repeated complaints to the police,
and Police Judges have in several
cases severely punished that class
of offenders.
Yesterday morning about 9 o'clock
O. Eritt, a young man living at the
Cosmopolitan Hotel, was walking
along Market street, and at Grant
avenue was approached by a man
who asked him in a surly tone for
a dime. Britt remarked that from
the strong Emell of his breath he
was not in need of a dime and con
tinued his walk. The man uttered
an oath and, drawing a knife out
of his pocket, opened the blade
which is about three inches long,
and followed Britt, threatening to
slash him.
Britt saw Policeman Orr on the
other side of the street and at once
told him what had occurred. Orr
GILLESPIE AND
KINNE ON THE
FIGHTING LINE
Peace Hath Fled the
Populist Camp.
VOLLIES FOR DR. GRISWOLD
A SHOT OR TWO FOR MR. MON
TEITH IN PASSING.
George H. Clough, the Municipal
Convention Secretary, Suffers
From Some Warm Long
Range Firing.
Gentle peace hath fled the local Popu
listic camp. The war broke out during
the last political campaign and has raged
with fervor ever since. The factions are
Dr. Griswold, George H. Clough and their
follow members of an investigating com
mittee on one side, and the Purity of
Elections Committee of the party, promi
nent in which are George D. Gillespie and
A. B. Kinne, on the other. A few days
ago Dr. Griswold published the report of
his committee, in which he arraigned the
Purity Committee for much political im
purity. This has brought Messrs. Gil
lespie and Kinne again up to the fighting
line.
"It is quite refreshing," said Mr. Gil
lespie, "to hear Dr. Griswold talk about
corruption since he v. as openly convicted
of stuffing the ballot box at the election j
of officers in the People's Party County
Committee in 1892. and narrowly escaped
being thrown out of the window. He
trained with the middle-of-the-road wing
of the party in 1&0S till they Ignored him
in making up their slate for delegates to
the State convention. He then flopped
over to the fusion side and was elected a
delegate on their ticket, and by them
made chairman of the delegation. He be
trayed this trust the first opportunity by
voting against fusion in the convention,
in what was considered a test vote. Since
then we have never trusted him, so he
is now attempting to rule or ruin the
party in this city, and is ably assisted by
George W. Monteith. who betrayed his
party in 1596 by defeating our candidate
for Congress in the First District. Mon
teith wanted to be nominated for Con
gress in 1898. but was rejected because of
his treachery in 1596. and was compelled
to resign from the State Central Commit
tee, State Executive Committee and Fu
sion Committee. Hence, sore-head No. 2.
Georee H. Clough was never heard of un
til Mr. Kinne and myself made him sec
retary of the County Committee and sec
retary of the municipal convention.
"When the Purity of Elections Committee
was appointed he thought he should be
made its secretary, but the committee
considered P. J. Pye much more compe
tent for the place and elected him to do
the work. This made Clousrh mad and he
has since been trying to get even on the
Purity of .elections Committee, notwith
standing the fact that the committee al
lowed him $S6 for his services as secretary
of the municipal convention, which was
the only extravagant expenditure that we
made during the campaign.
"In regard to the charge of paying our
selves salaries: In previous campaigns
the secretary of the Purity of Elections
Committee received $25 per week. Last
year we only paid MR. The purity com
mittee was investigated by the executive
committee and exonerated of every charge
to the satisfaction of all parties, with the
exception of a few persons of the Gris
wold stripe."
A B. Kinne also rakes the Griswold
party fore and aft with several hot vol
lies. Relative to Dr. Griswold's printing
patronage charges he says as proprietor
of the party paper he. of course, got much
of the printing, which amount' 1 to 1580.
Dr. Griswold used a large portion of the
space paid for out of the party funds.
George D. Griswold received $150 for his
entire summer's labor. Then committee
men, who gave their entire time and ser
vices to the campaign, were paid ?3 per
day. Mr. Kinne spe-akÃ as follows:
"The suggestion that any member of
the Purity of ElectlonsCommittee received
money or solicited money other than the
legitimate contributions which are ac
counted for, is an infamous attempt to
blacken the character of honest nten with
out incurring the responsibility therefor.
The statement that Mayor Phelan and
myself had any understanding before elec
tion with reference to my position in the
Health Office is on a par with the rest
of their statements, and also absolutely
without foundation. The subject was
1 never mentioned between us.'

placed the man under arrest and
sent him to the City Prison, where
charges of begging and assault with
a deadly weapon were booked
against him. The murderous mendi
cant gave the name of Thomas Mur
phy and his occupation a molder.
The knife was booked as evidence
against him. When searched a razor
was found concealed under his col
lar, and in his pockets were 60 cents
and five meal tickets.
Murphy denied that "he asked Britt
for money or drew a knife upon
him. He said he pulled out his knife
to cut his finger nails and was doing
so when the policeman arrested him.
He said he came here from Sacra
mento Saturday morning and in
tended to apply at the Union Iron
Works for a job. He could not give
the name or number of the hotel
where he said he slept Saturday
night. His appearance is not pre
possessing, and the police believe
that he is a professional beggar.
THE ASSESSOR
WOULD BE THE
CITY'S MAYOR
But Mr. Dodge Has
His Troubles.
AMBITION AND PATRONAGE
A HUNGRY BRIGADE SHARP
ENS LONG KNIVES.
The Doctor Makes the First Move in
the Local Campaign, but the
Examiner's Patronage
Makes Trouble.
The local Democratic barometer
is C:<playing to all competent poli
tical forecasters signs of the com
ing: storm which will begin gath
ering strength in a very perceptible
way within twenty-four hours after the
adjournment of the Legislature. Ine
"pollies" are anticipating an exceptionally
hot local campaign this year, owing to
the new charter, which will go into effect
on January 1 under the administration of
a new set of officials, to be elected on
November 7.
"With the new order of things tho
Mayor's office will at once assume trans
cendant importance to every practical
politician interested in municipal patron
age, and this office will be the political
storm center from the start.
It is only among the local Democracy
that prospective candidates for Mayor can
yet to be seen to loom. Phelan will be a
candidate, as everybody knows, and a
great portion of the Democracy will be
out to defeat his nomination. Hundreds
of the boys vaguely turn to Colonel J. F.
Smith as a possible Moses, but nobody
knows whether or not he will be back in
time or whether he would accept a noml
j nation if he could get it.
Acording to general local Democratic
information there la only one candidate
who is thus early laying underground
wires to capture the nomination, and that
man is Assessor Dodge, who happens to
be the subject of more political gossip and
adverse criticism Just now than any other
officer of the municipality. Mr. Dodge is
laying for the big nomination. Charles
Wesley Reed is his biggest Warwick, and
he has come assistant Warwicks in the
persons of Dr. Kagan, Gavin McNab, Ed
ward Godchaux and others who are cred
ited among the practical Democratic poli
ticians with directing the distribution of
i the main portion of his patronage,
! amounting to forty-two deputies and
about 100 extra men. As Mr. Dodge was
the only Democrat elected to a dispensa
tion of any good patronage the entire
j local army of place hunters have turned
their hungry eyes on the Assessor's office
and Mr. Dodge has been having a most
exciting experience.
It was a great anct wise Democratic
leader who once said that if a man gave
one man a place he made one ingrate and
nine enemies, and the talk about Mr.
Dodge recalls the maxim.
Assessor Dodge is finding his road to
fame beset with thorns. The thorns are
all over the tenderloin. and all over South
of-Market. The disposition of the As
sessor's patronage is discussed far more in
certain wide circles than the policy of ex-
I pansion. One thorn that Mr. Dodge has
i been pricked with is Major Harney, Har
bor Commissioner, and chairman of one
faction of the local Democracy. Mr.
Harney and his friends are whetting long
! knives for Dodge, because he refused to
: honor some patronage drafts drawn by
I the Examiner.
Late in the recent campaign the Ex
i amincr secured a conference of party
i leaders with a view to getting the beaten
I Raihevites to stand in and support tne
local ticket. M. F. Tarpey on behalf of
I the Examiner promised one-third of the
local patronage to the Rainey wing as tne
price. Chairman Harney, Secretary Mc-
Govern and some others of the 450 agreed
I to the proposition, but a meeting of the
whole committee on the proposition broke
| up in a great row and only eighty-one
i stood by the local Democratic ticket
j nominated by the Committee of One
Hundred.
When the election was over Mr. Dodge
j was â¢.â¢ailed upon by the Examiner to rec
! ognize the bargain and did so. The Ex
! aminer allowed Harney srx deputies and
' fifteen extras, and Dodge, it is said, told
I Harney to send in his list and it would
! be all right. Harney's list included Secre
-1 tary John F. McGovern, who had long
done valiant work for the Rainey organi
zation; S. T. Kohlman and George A.
Love, two other local war horses. The
other three were John G. Fitzgerald, late
of the Sheriff's office; John Bennett, from
the Recorder's office, and Tom Clark,
formerly of the Street Department. The
last three were appointed and tho first
three were not. Harney and his friends
charge that the three appointed got there
only through other influences.
Recently Harney went out to the Asses
sor's office to see about the three that
were turned down, but got no satisfaction.
The upshot mi an exchange of hot lan
guage and as Harney left he is reported
to have said to Dodge:
"You have gone back on your word. All
agreements between us are off and just
remember that I am still in politics."
Thus Harney, McGovern and their friends
â  have no further use for Dodge or for Me
' Nab, Reed, et al., to whose influence the
turning down is partly charged.
"Harry" Zemansky was slated for an
important deputyship and was downed, it
is said, because he was a friend of Max
Popper. The only failure that Charles
Wesley Reed has scored on Assessor's
patronage is said to be in the case of
"I arry" Conlon. the robust young hero of
! many a Buckley primary in the Twenty
eighth Reed recommended Larry, and
when he asked about it later Mr. Dodge
is reported to have said: "Why. Mr.
] Reed, I am surprised at -your making
such a recommendation. Mr. McNab tells
me that he is nothing but a hoodlum and
a Buckley lamb." Larry is desperate and
swears that he is going to ''punch McNab
in the snoot." . . . d
The disgruntled legion charge that
Dodge through Reed. Ragan and other
Warwi'cks, has appointed all sorts of
Raineyites who knifed him and the rest of
the Democratic ticket, and the roar that
is going up is an interesting accompani
ment to the progress of Mr. Dodge toward
the Mayor's chair.
SNOWBOUND TRAIN
WITHOUT PROVISIONS
Starvation Confronts Passengers on
an Overland Stalled at Iron
Mountain.
CHEYENNE, Wye., March s.â An ur
gent message for relief was received to
day from the Cheyenne and Northern
train in the snow at Iron Mountain. The
provisions are reduced to a few beans
and a little coffee, with forty-two per
sons to be fed. They have been snowed
in for six days. The conditions are des
perate as the adjacent ranches where
food has heretofore been obtained are
about out of provisions.
Hon John F. McDermott, John Foxton
and W. K. Foxton. who walked in from
the imprisoned train, report the cuts
drifted level full of hard snow between
here and Iron Mountain, and that the
only way of getting through with a train
will be by shoveling. A relief train with
a supply of provisions and 100 shovelers
was sent out this morning, but it can
not reach the imprisoned train before to
morrow morning.
The blockade on the Tjnion Pacific was
raised to-day and trains are now running.
It was with great difficulty that the ro
taries and wedge plows managed to push
through as the cuts were all piled full
of hard packed snow. The trains that
were Imprisoned at Laramie came
through all the way from seven to twelve
hours late. The weather to-night ia
warm and fair.

OLD CLOTHES ARE AN ISSUE
THE AFFIDAVIT MAN IS IN THE
POLITICAL ARENA.
Many Unusual Incidents Make the
Election Next Week One of the
Most Interesting in
Years.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, | -,
308 Broadway. March 5. j 1
If a hundred candidates want to earn j J
the undying gratitude of a suffering city i
they should resolve not to inflict a single j â 
speech on their victims during the coming i
â¢week. I don't think a hundred votes will be | Â«
changed by tlfe oratory, argument, facts ; ,
.and fancies and vilification promised dur
ing the last seven days of the campaign. j 1
For a year and a half Oakland has been ; '
upset by political campaigns of one kind ,
or another, and by special elections. Now !
the only people who are attending the
meetings are the followers of the speak- ; <
era, who go to make a snowing and cer- ]
tainly not to be convinced or entertained. â 
It is surprising how few can be induced to â¢
spend the evening listening to denuncia- '
turns and promises, even when a few na- '
tional firebrands are thrown in. Nothing I
new Is brought up, and each side is kept | â¢
busy contradicting what the other camp j '
says, so that in the end everybody winds | i
up pretty much where they started out. â 
I can conceive of there being va.ue to the I
orators in some 01 the stump speeches | ]
made, if Barnum were alive and looking ' :
out for freaks for the cap and bells ap- | _
pendix to his circus, but outside of this : .
field some of the ambitious declaim are '
very much out of place.
One of the most amusing "issues" -* the ;
campaign so far has been a suit of the 1 ,
Street Superintendent's rÂ»'-* clothes. Une â¢
issue was set up by Mr. Miller's political .
opponents, who declared that HÂ» had once , j
employed a man who was broke â¦â Â» do
gome work at his home and had paid him :
with a suit of old clothes. The inference i )
â was made that Mr. Miller had employed ! ,
the man on the streets and had paid him â¢
â¢with old clothes, to the financial advan- â 
tape of said Mr. Miller. This was very se- j
rious and although I doubt if anybody i '
â who will help to elect Mr. Miller placed ! ;
any reliance on the story, it was consid- i '
ered necessary to resort to the affidavit ! â 
man, and when all the sworn testimony ' ]
â¢was in it appeared that a certain man had |
been employed by Mr. Miller to work at ]
his home and that Mr. Miller had given (
him for his day's work, a dollar, some
meals, and a suit of clothes "of as much : 1
value as a new $15 suit," and that said ]
man had afterward been given work on ' 'â¢â 
the streets, for which he received his j ;
.â warrant.-; and was regularly paid. The ; â¢
next tirr.Â»Â». Miller wants a 'lay's work done j \
â¢around h'.a home I wish he would let me i ;
know. ! J
' Then) hare been more than rumors dur- j j
Ing the past two days of certain nasty | .
prevoiailons to be sprung this week con- ! i
cerninsr Home of the candidates now run- I
Jiing for -ward Counetlmen. Details of â 
â¢<iivorcÂ«Â« suits and of squandered fortunes jj
me promised, with all the attendant evils. ]
I sincerely hope that any candidate wno
â will open up such a campaign will be j ,
juried so deeply next Monday that he wni
Jiever be heard from in public -ife again.
The public heart goes out to Auditor
Enow in his greatest sorrow. Sometimes,
In the busy humdrum of public life we are
apt to acquire the habit of regarding an j
official as a machineâ or a register of facts
and figures. Such men are found to be I
convenient in daily life, especially to j
newspaper men, but it is not easy always j
to associate the individual with the of- j
fice. With Mr. Snow, tm9 is not true. !
It is no trouble to him to enter into the j
spirit of a visitor's query and to explain j
anything that may be insufficiently under- j
stood. The Auditor has seemed to Know ]
his business so thoroughly that it is a |
pleasure to know him and to note me |
sincerity with which he enters Into his :
duties " Still, to the mass of the public I
he was "Auditor" Snow, a man of figures i
and practical ideas. Now it is different, j
"We know another Mr. Snow. The unwel
come hand of Death has reveale^ the bet
ter side of this worthy official's char
acter and the secrets of his home nave i
been, of necessity, brought out. Now it j
Is known that for years he has been tak- ,
Ing a part in the human drama more I
noble even than serving the public and of
â¢which few knew anything. And â <th this
load of added anxiety the busy work of
his office went on with unfailing regu
larity This is manhood and represents
the character of the Republican nominee
for Mayor.
Perhaps for the first time since <_o.,viand
Was a big city, her political complexion is j
to be definitely determined next Monday. ]
to a single vote. On looking at tna
cample ballot it is seen that there are but
two names for City Attorney. This is
the most important office in the city gov
ernment, not even excepting the Mayor.
The two candidates are City Attorney
Dow, the choice of the Republicans and
Municipal League, and Thomas F. Gar- |
rity the choice of the Independents and i
the Democrats. In former years there
have always been three leading candi
dates and "some others, but this time tne
line is drawn squarely. It is one of the
most interesting points to be decided at
the election. Mr. Dem's friends claim 1000
majority. Mr . Garrlty's friends say
"walk over." t , . , .
Another cause of much speculation Is
the vote Councilman "Woodward will re
ceive in his ward. One of the shrewdest
politicians has said seventy-five. I am in
clined to double that estimate, it being a
big ward. Mr. Woodward is confident he
â¢will succeed himself.
Here is the- latest piece of campaign
experience that has come my way. I will
give It verbatim. "There ie a certain place
in town where there are about thirty citi
zens who will vote as you tell them to if
' you do the right thing. Hire a room down
there and, you know, the saloons are
closed on election days. Well, put a few
gallons of wine in there and a few sand- I
wiches, and during the lunch hour march
in your men. Let them have plenty of
'dago red' and then give them your num
ber and march them to the polls. You
can do it easily with a trustworthy man
and about eight dollars. Remember, Da
vie was only beaten art: the last election
by about forty men." This was all said
in such evident good faith, or I would
give away all the details. If I should re
" ceivc thirty-one votes I hope 1 shall not
be credited with the purchase of the other
thirty for eight dollars handled by a
"trustworthy" man.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1899.
ALL KINDS OF
JOKERS MAY
BE EXPECTED
Water Rates WiH Be
Fixed To-Night.
OAKLAND'S ANNUAL STRIFE
THE SOLID SIX APPEAR TO BE
BEPENTANT.
After the Experience of Past Years
Any Kind of a Surprise May Be
Confidently Looked
Tor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 5.
The most important meeting of the year
will be held by the City Council on Mon
day night. The business of fixing the wa
ter rates will be taken up and no one is
able to guess what may happen. There
have been some most remarkable Bur
prises in the Council chamber over the
fixing of water rates, and last year it was
the cause of several riots.
The ordinance handed in to the commit
tee last night by Councilman Earl has up
set all the calculations regarding the pro
gramme of the "solid six." Everybody
had expected that Earl's ordinance would
be a high one, especially as only two of
the members of the six are seeking re
election. It is, in reality, the well-known
"non-partisan" ordinance of 1897, gener
ally considered to be the low-st rates ever
passed by the Council. Mr. Upton, on the
other hand, has introduced an ordinance '
much higher than that of Mr. Earl; but |
j much lower than the rates in the infam- j
i ous document passed last year.
There will undoubtedly be some warm
debating at the meeting. If indications â¢
; are faithful the "solid six" have gone to
I pieces and the city can depend upon a j
fair rate for both public and private use. j
i Whether the Earl or tfle Upton ordinance \
will pass is doubtful. If the six stand â 
â¢ t'.rm for the low rates they can pass them ;
! and the lobby will be regaled with the pc- j
; culiar exhibition of the men who voted to j
j rob the citizens last year fixin- a lower >
! rate than that favored by the five men
, who have been loy-l to their trusts
throughout.
There are those, however, who would
not be surprised to see UÂ»e six spring a
totally new ordinance to-morrow night.
Such "things have hannencHi before.
Independents Meet To-Night.
OAKLAND, March s.â There -will be a j
meeting of the Independents at Gibbs'
store, North Oakland, to-morrow night.
Hon. John L. Davie. R. M. Clement,
Colonel Thomas F. Garrity and others
will address the voters on that occasion.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS, j
THE VAUDEVILLE STAGEâ C. D. H..
Los Angeles. Cal. If you have an ambi
tion to appear on the vaudeville stage j
file an application with the manager of I
the theater at which you would like to |
I appear.
HOMES FOR CHILDRENâ A. S., City.
i A person who is unable to support a child
I by reason of misfortune and inability to
obtain employment should notify the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
I Ch'ldren and it will take steps to have
the child cared for.
PROPERTY AND POLlCYâ Subscriber,
Sierra Valley, Cal. The question asked in
regard to property and Insurance is not
sufficiently clear to enable this depart
ment to ascertain what the writer wishes
to have answered. This department c;in
not guess the meaning of correspondents.
THE SHARKEY-JEFFRIES FIGHTâ
A reader, Redding, Cal. The published
reports of the match between Sharkey
! and Jeffries in San Francisco May 6, 1898,
' fail to show that Sharkey was knocked
! down by what is known as "a square
blow." ~lf that had occurred it certainly
I would appear in the reports.
KANSAS CITYâ T. J. L., City. There Is
a Kansas City in Kansas and one in Mis
souri. The reason why there is a general
i belief that there is but one city of that
; name Is explained in an answer to another
! correspondent published under the head
lof "As to Kansas City," February 8,
| 1899. in Answers to Correspondents in The
Call.
A LANDLORD'S RIGHTâ E. S. G.,
City. The question as to a landlord's
: rights in the matter of a tenant holding
over for a short period beyond the time
for which rent was paid would depend
' on the contract or understanding between
! the tenant and the landlord, and without
a knowledge of the terms of the contract
a. definite answer cannot be given.
EVERETT AND BELLâ E. M. L., City.
It was not W. M. Everett, but Edward
Everett of Massachusetts who was a can
j didate for Vice President in ISGO with
! John Bell of Tennessee, and It was not
M. W. Everett who was Secretary of
i State in the Cabinet of President Hayes;
but the Secretary of State who served
in the Haves Cabinet from 1877 to 1S&1 was
William Maxwell Evarts.
FOUNDATIONS.â A correspondent who
believes that the answer given recently
in this department in relation to founda
tions was not full enough writes: An
owner may excavate to any depth under
fourteen feet below the curb level and
shall notify the adjoining owner to sup
port his building during said excavation.
! On the other hand, if the owner desires
| to excavate below a depth of fourteen
feet he is compelled to support the house
adjoining, which is not down to a depth
of fourteen feet.
DYING INTESTATEâ Subscribers, Car
ter, Cal. "If a woman dies, leaving no
will, no debts and a piece of property,
say 320 acres of land, can the three chil
dren, the only heirs, by any procesÃ of
deeding the property to one another avoid
the trouble and expense of probating the
estate in court, and could they give a
clear title to an intending purchaser?" Is
a question that is answered by stating
that it cannot be done. The estate must
go to probate In order that the heirs may
Becure their legal rights.
THE NEXT LEAP YEAR-Subscriber,
Canyon, El Dorado County, Cal. In order
to correct the slight variation of time,
which takes place every year since the
adoption of the present calendar, it was
ordered that to make the time as nearly
correct as possible every hundredth year,
except such as is dlvisable by four hun
dred, should not be a leap year. The year
1896 was a leap year, but as 1900 cannot be
divided by 400 there will not be twenty
nine days in the February of that year.
The next leap year will fall In the year
1904.
ELECTRIC RAILWAY-J. M. 8., City.
In the overhead circuit system of elec
tric railways one or two conducting wires
are carried along the road or by its side
or directly over the center of the track.
Each motor car takes its current from
the conductor by a flexible wire or other
connection attached to a little car or trol
ley that rolls along the conductor. In some
systems two parallel wires are carried
from tho dynamo station, and the trolley
by double lead 3 throws the car motor into
a bridge circuit from wire to wire. In
other cases but a single overhead con
ductor is provided ana the motor takes
current from it, and then through the
wheels, rails and perhaps WRter and gas
mains connected with the rails Is ground
ed. Then the current passing from wheel
to rail increases the tractive force of the
wheels, but if the rails are dirty the
grounding is imperfect and resistance is
set up.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March s.â John Lawson
of Chicago, known as the "Terrible
Swede," won the great long distance
race here this afternoon by a narrow
margin, and thousands of throats
cheered him and thousands of eyes saw
him to it. Not only did he win it. but
in so doing he established a new
world's record for 100 miles of 4 hours
34 minutes and 30 seconds, the best pre
vious mark being 4:40.
The cycle meet, which commenced
here s'esterday, was continued to -ri w
befo-" nn Immense audience, remind
ing one of the halcyon clays of cycling
in 1896-7, when the Garden City Club
had to enlarge its grandstands after
every meet to accommodate the in
creasing crowds. It augers well for
the season of 1899, and the club here
is quite pleased in consequence.
The principal event on to-day's pro
gramme was the 100-mile race between
all the long-distance cracks who have j
recently been competing in San Fran
csico. Added interest wa3 given the \
race because "Charley" Wells, the big
Bay City rider, started, and considering
that this was his first long distance
race he did phenomenally well. A spe- t
cial prize had been offered by the man- j
agement for the man leading the most i
number of laps, and Wells won it, head
ing the bunch eighty-seven times,
against Barnaby's seventy and Fred- |
cricks' forty-seven. Wells finished the j
race in sixth position. At one time, on j
the forty-fourth mile, it looked as if
he would gain a lap and thereby win, j
as no one could hope to regain it on j
him. An amateur sprint race was on, \
and as the men flew by the hundred- j
milers on the last lap, Wells, who was
leading the long distance men, tacked i
on behind the sprinters and by follow
ing them gained half a lap on his op
ponents. The sprint race ended then, !
however, and as he had no one to pace
him further the bunch soon caught up
again and he was back in his old posi- j
tion.
The starters in ... the big race were i
Nawn, Stevens, Goodman, Chapman, ;
Clem Turville, Charles Turville, Barna
by, Wells, John Lawson, Iver Lawson,
Pilkington, Fredericks, Ashinger, Aron- !
son and Julius, fifteen in all. They i
were sent away at 1:20 p. m. Ashinger
and Aronson dropped out at eleven
j miles on account of the killing pace,
I and Pilkington lost a lap on the nine
j teenth mile from the same cause. Clem
' Turville lost two laps on the thirty
fifth and then quit, and spent the re
mainder of the afternoon on the front
! seat of Fournler's "infernal machine.
Iver Lawson and Fredericks gave it up
j at sixty-five miles, and the remaining
ten finished the race.
The finish was wildly exciting, the
ten men all being bunched on the last
lap. Barnaby and Chapman were in
front and started the sprint. Barnaby
I rode wide to let his team mate, Chap
| man, through to win, but it also let
I Lawson through, and the sturdy Swede
beat out the Georgian by less than a
foot right at the tape. The order at the
finish was: Lawson, Chapman, Good-
I man, Stevens, Charles Turville, Wells,
j Julius, Barnaby, Nawn and Pilkington,
! and they all finished within inches of
I each other.

He is looked upon as a coming man.
The Bay City Wheelmen's riders cap- |
tured both the short distance open j
events. W. G. Furman of that club
won the mile open professional in two j
straight heats from a field composed of
Weinig, Gibson, Cotter. Downing, Leon
art Eaton and Wyman, paced by Ald
ridge Downing was second and Leon
art third in both heats, and they hal
'it out with Furman each time. Furman
is in wonderful shape, as he must well
be to beat those men. He won the mile
open Saturday from a similarly fast
Ralph Robinson, a recent addition to
the Bay City Club, won the amateur
mile his closest competitors being M.
E Francis, George Doll and "Brother
in-law" Wastle. Robinson showed rare
speed and used good judgment, win
ning two straight heats. '
Henri Fournier and Clem Turville
put up an astounding ride on the "in
fernal" tandem. They covered a third
of a mile in 29 3-5 seconds, which is at
the rate of 1:28 4-5 for the mile. Four
nier's seat came loose and they did not :
atempt a mile, for, as the Frenchman j
expressed it, at the gait they were yo
ing he preferred his saddle more secure,
because Turville did not know how to
manage the motor, and if he (Henri)
fell off there was no telling what might
become of the outfit.
Fournier was offered and refused
$2000 In cash to-day for his "infernal"
tandem. He sets no price on it. He
sold his motor tricycle for $500 to Miller,
the six-day champion, and his motor
bicycle for $1000 to a San Francisco
millionaire, whose name he says he was
requested not to disclose for the pres
ent.
To add to the record breaking fea
tures of the splendid day's sport, Or
lando L. Stevens of lowa went a mila
paced by Fournier & Co. In 1:40 3-5,
which beats McFarland's California
record six seconds.
The San Francisco wheelmen all re
turned home on to-night's train, but
the Easterners will remain here for
several weeks to complete their training
for the: Eastern circuit, as the track
and climatic conditions suit them per
fectly. Another meet will be held here
next Sunday under the same conditions,
including a long distance event, prob
ably at 100 miles, and several short dis
tance races. Floyd McFarland, jvho
has been ill, will go into the competi
tion to show his San Jose friends -what
he can do, and some good sport Is
looked for.

When the War in the South Ended.
During the Civil AVar the majority of
volunteers enlisted for "three years or
during the war." In the popular minds
that conflict ended at Appornattox. with
the surrender of General Lee. Of course
it did not end then, because General John
ston kept the field for pome days after
that event and General E. Klrby Smith
did not surrender the troops west oi the
Mississippi until still later. The Supreme
Court in one of its derisions where the
question arose decided that the Civil War
both began and ended, legally, on the
dates of certain proclamations by the
President. The legal beginning was held
to be April 19, 1861, as to South Carolina,
Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi.
Louisiana and Texas, and as to Virginia
and North Carolina April 27, 1-1. April
â¢' IKC.6 President Johnson issued a procla
mation declaring the war at an end In
Virginia, North Carolina, South < arolina,
Georgia Florida. Mississippi. Tennessee.
Alabama. Louisiana and Arkansas and
August 30 of that year another proclaim
ing the war at an end In Texas. As Lee
Bun-endered April ?. 1865, the popu.ar .imp
for the end oi the Civil War.it will be
seen thai a year, less a week, elapsea
from that event and the first .of the Presi
dent's proclamations fÂ°â¢alÂ£ proclaim
ing the war at an end in Virginia and
certain other States and more than six
teen months till Texas was Proclaimed l to
be In a pacific frame of mind.â Chicago

A Bailroad's Bed Aflame.
A portion of the Buffalo. Rochester and
Pittsburg Railroad will have to be rebuilt
at Punxsutawney, Pa. When the work
was started last spring the contractors
mok a lot <>f cinders and cuke dust from
the Walston cokeyarda for the foundation
of a large tilling at the lower end of the
town Dirt was piled on top of this arid
the road apparently completed. Recently
clouds of smoke Issued from under the
ilirt pile, the filling began to Bag, and it
became apparent that the coke pile under
the dirt was on fire. Holes were dug in
the mound and thousands of gallons of
water poured \ n to quench the fire. It
had r.o effect, and now the whole dirt pile
will have to be removed or a new track
built.â Pittsrmrg (Pa.) Times.

LOVE THAT WOULD
NOT BROOK DELAY
Chicago Lovers
Came Here
to Wed.
Pretty Lillian Leddy
and Allen Dowler
Were Super
stitious.
"True love hates and will not bear de
lay" is a sentiment as old as love itself,
and when coupled in lovers' hearts with
the equally ancient superstition that to
a wedding day is sure to bring
bad lack, a marriage is oftentimes cele
brated under unusual rircumstanees. This
Bupersitition Impelled a pretty young Chi
cago p:r! i the snow-clad continent
alone, that she might become a bride on
the day she appointed when her lover
asked h r to become his wife. Six months
a p (1 Mis-; Lillian Leddy, a prominent and
popular young lady of Chicago, met Allen
Dowler, a prosperous young business
nan. They soon became lovers,' and, (Us
ing the opposition of the girls
family, they decided to wed. Saturday,
March 4. was th* date set for the con
summation of their vows, and that no
misfortune might follow a postponement,
the fair bride, in "response to her lovers
request came to San Francisco and tney
were married soon after her arrival.
The groom was compelled by the iron
laws of business to make a trip to ( aliror

bride at th< â â  So ho telegraphed

where they would begin their honeymoon
glowing warmth of a summer sun.
BMding farewell to her relatives, the
bride-to-be started on th..' journey.
While his sweetheart was traveling
across tho mountains and plains the
groom made all necessary arrangements
for the wedding ceremony. â 
A marriage license was secured, the

bride wl i to arrive hero Fri

delayed by snowstorms, and when the
groom hurriedly searched the

THE FAST CHITOSE
TO RECEIVE GUESTS
A BRILLIANT GARDEN PARTY
FOR WEDNESDAY.
High Naval and Military Officials to
Attend â A Private Reception
and Lunch Yesterday.
His Imperial Japanese Majesty's world- |
beating cruiser Chitose, the latest output I
of the Union Iron Works, is fast taking |
on her finishing touches and will soon
depart for the land of the chrysanthe
mum. there to receive her armament and
go into commission.
Before the splendid ship leaves this
port it Is the intention of her officers to j
afford the people of this city ample op
portunity to inspect her. For this pur
pose a reception will be given to foreign
ers on Saturday next from 8 to 11 a. m.
and 1 to 4 p. m. On Sunday next the big
fighting ship will be thrown open only to
the Japanese residents, who ate prepar
ing for a great gala day.
The special social event on hoard the ;
Chitose will occur, however, on Wednes
day of this week. It is to be a Japanese
"garden party," at which there will be
present General Shatter, Commodore
â¢Watson, Captain Terrill and other of
ficers of the battle ship lowa, Mayor Phe
lan, military and naval officers generally
and four hundred of the most prominent
officials and citizens of San Francisco.
The crack cruiser will be elaborately
decorated and no efforts are to be spared
to make the occasion a brilliant one. .
At the Invitation of Paymaster H. Ya
inasakf and Second Lieutenant U. Suzuki,
a party consisting of Captain E. B. Hat
field. Captain J. T. Norman Callaway and
Mr and Mrs. J. V. Van Eaton enjoyed a
private inspection of the vessel yesterday
afternoon. The Chitose, even to those
who have seen the best warships that
have been built here or have visited this
port Is a marvel of construction, particu
larly in the matter of her scientific equip
ments Every advantageous device for
labor-saving, quickness of action and
creature comfort has been employed, and
â when she goes into commission the Eiti-
T>eror will have the satisfaction of know-
Ire that he possesses one of the most up
to-date cruisers in the world.-
After the inspection an appetizing lunch
was served in the handsome wardroom,
during which toasts were given to "The
Jananese Emperor." "The Chitose and
Her Crew." "The Only Dewey" and "The
Builders of the Warship." A proof of the
hi" h regard in which the officers hold the
American navy was shown by the fact
that the most conspicuous decorations
of the ward room were large portraits of
Admiral Dewey and Rear Admiral Samp-
Son.
Bishop Montgomery to Lecture.
BishOD Montgomery of Los Angeles will
appointed and perturbed at not finding
the object of his love. He Bought the
conductor, and was Informed that the
train had come on without the Chicago
coaches. Mr. Dowler returned to tho city
and, with a lover' 3 Impatience, awaited
the arrival of the delayed train. The
creeping hours finally passed and bis
bride was by his side. The happy lovers
hastened to the Rev. Charles E. Locke
and were united Saturday afternoon, the
day set when their troth was plighted.
In the happiness of the moment the
happy pair did not forget their relatives
at home, some of whom had opposed the
match, but as usual the opposition only
increased the flame of love. A dispatch
was sent to the bride's family inform
ing them of the wedding, and later they
received a telegram from Mrs. Leddy,
conveying her blessing and wishes for a
life of uninterrupted happiness.
CHICAGO, March s.â Through a tele
gram to the bride's mother, Mrs. Bridget
Leddy, 171 Oakwood boulevard, it became
known to-day that A. L. Dowler, travel
ing representative of the liquor house of
Clark Bros.. Peoria, 111., and Miss Lillian
Leddy of this city were married Satur
day in San Francisco. The young people
first met a year ago at a social function.
Dowler was favorably known to the'
family of the bride, but objections to the
wedding Were made by Mrs. Leddy and
the elder sisters on account of Lillian's
youth. A week ago Miss Leddy received
a telegram from her lover from San Fran
cisco, asking her to come immediately.
Last Tuesday she left her home on Oak
wood boulevard and arrived in San Fran
cisco two days ago. No further particu
lars have been received by the family.
Since leaving college at I>ake Forest two
years ago, Miss Leddy has been a favorite
in South Side and North Side society cir
cles, and her home, with her mother, Mrs.
B. Leddy, and her sist< r, Mrs. S. B.
Jones, has been the Mecca of many ad
mirers.
The engagement with Mr. Dowler was
of but six months' duration. Miss Leddy
would allow nothing to separate her and
her lover. â  ,
Two weeks ago Mrs. Dowler, a former
wife, from whom Mr. Dowler had sep
arated, was granted a decree of divorce,
and no time was lOStby Mr. Dowler in
Bending for his Chicago fiancee.
"We were opposed to the marriage at
first " said Mrs. Jones, a sister of the
bride, "on account of Lillian's extreme
youth but she was determined to marry
Mr. Dowler. and this morning we were
much pleased to learn that the marriage
had taken place. Mr. Dowler has many
friends in Chicago and is popular with all
who know him."-
Mrs. H. Axton. sister of the bnde, is a
ââ ell-known actress, her stage name being â 
Marie Leddy. She was last seen hrre in I
the Frohman production of "Charley s j
A FEORIA. 111.. March 6.â M. A. Dowler
has traveled for Clark Bros., rectifiers
and liquor dealers of this city, for many
years, and is very highly regarded in a
business way at least by his employers.
BUTTE, Mont.. March 5. -Elizabeth M.
Dowler was granted a divorce from A. L. j
Dowler by Judge Clancy on February 9, j
on the ground of desertion. Defendant

She claimed to have seen her husband
there about two months ago and endeav
ored to effect a reconciliation and resume
the obligations of a wife, but her husband
would not consent. She claimed that since
the separation she has been living
on the income from an estate left by
! her father. Mrs. Dowler is a strikingly
i handsome woman, and has been in Butte

Sport at Sutro Baths.
The swimming contests at Sutro Baths
yesterday attracted a big crowd. Beforo
! the races and after their conclusion the
j immense tank was filled with bathers, who
â¢ disported themselves in the water to their
[ hearts' content. The first race, a 50-yard
dash for novices, was won by H. McKen
zie. with A. Beysess second.' J. Guerin
won the 100-yard dash for juveniles, with
O. Beysess second. The obstacle race
afforded much amusement and was won
by C. Strahlin, with H. McKenzie second.
J. A. Jackson won the open to all under

Beysess proved the best trick and fancy
springboard diver. J. Carroll being a close

How a Brave Deed Was Rewarded.
Morris Bean, the Merchants' Exchange
boatman, who. with Officer James Fergu
son, rescued James Kltterman and four
other persons from the bay near Meiggs
wharf last Friday, has been rewarded for
his deed. Mr. Kittrrman gave him $5, and
as some of the men struggling in the
water by the side of their overturned
boat would in all probability have been
drowned, Mr. Kitterman and the others
cannot be Classed as spendthrifts. Kit
terman offered Ferguson the same sum,
but he refused it. saying that a portion
of his duty was to save life. Bean gave
another boatman who assisted in the-res
cue a portion of the reward. So it cost
Mr. Kitterman $. r i to have himself and
four friends saved from drowning.
Death of Captain Madison.
Captain Hans Madison, the well-known
ship owner of this city, died in Fruit

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, MABCH fi. 1899.
HORSE RACING
IS NOW TO BE
RESTRICTED
Supervisors Will Pass
an Ordinance.
GAMBLING TO BE PROHIBITED
AIGELTINOER WILL PRESENT
RESOLUTIONS TO-DAY.
Sentiment of the City Fathers Is !
Strongly Against the Perni
cious Operations of the
Racetracks.
The article punished in last Friday's
. Call, in which It was clearly shown that
â¢ the people of San Francisco are reaping
' a bitter harvest of disgrace, demoraliza
tion and death from the insidious opera
| , tions of the race tracks has determined
, | the Board of Supervisors to take imme
. diate action upon this question of mo
mentous import to the community at
' large.
At to-day's meeting of the board Su
pervisor Aigeltinger will introduce an or
j dinance having for its purpose the pro
| hibition of gambling on the races in this
city and county. This, it is believed, will
effectually stop horse racing, because it
is the gambling proposition which is the
mainstay of the sport. Take away the
betting and the game is not profitable
enough to satisfy its promoters.
Clerk John A. Russell of the board, at
| the request of Supervisor Aigeltinger, has
| been busy for the past few days prepar
! ing the draft of a resolution covering the
case. He has several ordinances which
came up before former -boards, but failed
: of passage. He will incorporate the best
J portions of these measures into one which
! will allow no legal loophole and be sweep
! ing its character.
It is thought, too, that in this way the
\ poolroom evil, a pernicious adjunct of the
! race?, will be successfully coped with, and
, that those institutions will be wiped out
of existence.
If it be found that the ordinance pro
' hihiting gambling entirely will not stand
the constitutional test, or cannot pass in
the board by reason of its arbitrary rul
ing, then another will be introduced pro
viding for the limitation of horse racing
to thirty or sixty days. In that event the
desired result might be attained, Inas
much as horse owners would find it a
Inking proposition to bring their horses
here for such a short period. In either
case the long record of murder, suicide,
embezzlement, arson and thefts in this
i city would be materially reduced. Su
-1 pervisor Aigeltinger whra seen yesterday
; in regard to his proposed ordinance said:
"It is time that something be done to
! prevent the terrible damago that horse
: racing has inflicted upon San Francisco
I and its citizens. I have for a long time
I been considering the advisability of pre
senting an ordinance covering the case,
and the able article in Friday's Call has
spurred me on. The presentation of the or
dinance at our meeting to-morrow will be
! the outcome of the worthy agitation. The
' horse racing proposition and its attendant
j evils have gone too far already and I am
j in favor of any measure that will provide
I the necessary remedy. I feel quite certain
that, my colleagues are keenly alive to the
danger and will stand by me in the mat
ter. If the prohibition of gambling will !
not correct the evil then we will limit the :
period for racing, and I guess that will do i
it.
"I am not an enemy of horse racing, for
in it=elf it is a noble, sport, but I am un
alterably opposed to the pernicious influ
! ence it exerts upon our younger genera
! tlon in the gambling on the race course. I
! am vice president of fhe San Francisco
i Driving Club and even at our last meet
ing at Ingleside we, were powerless to
prevent certain bookmakers from fixing
one of the races. It is this element that
! degrades the sport. Why, the 'touts'
who lure people, to bet are provided with
frco passes to the races so they can ply
i their nefarious vocation.
"I maintain that we must act on the
i question, and quickly, too. for the com
i munity is 'entitled to some protection."
Supervisor Perrault was equally as cm
i phatic as his coleagues on the necessity of
' legislation on the racing evil.
"I am in favor," said he, "of restricting
! horse racing. There have been too many
lives wrecked or lost in the passion for
gambling at Jr."-leside. and in public and
private affairs the racing habit has been
1 productive of sad results. I will support
i any measure which will properly contend
â  with the problem, and I heartily concur
I with Supervisor Aigeltinger in his earnest
i efforts to drive the terrible evil from our
I midst."

JAMES T. RUCKER DIES
AFTER A WEEK'S ILLNESS
He Was Taken With a Chill, Which Rapidly De
veloped Into Pneumonia.
JAMES T. RUCKER. one of the best known citizens of California, who for
the past year has been a resident of San Francisco, died Saturday afternoon
at 3 o'clock at his residence, lf<2l Vallejo street, of pneumonia. On Monday
last he was taken with a chill while down town attending to some business.
He had only recently returned from a trip through Oregon and "Washington, and
it is thought by his friends that he contracted a cold, that left his system in a
weakened condition. He rapidly grew worse and while, he received the best
of medical attention, nothing was able to stop* the ravages which finally resulted
in his death.
Mr. Rucker was a native of Santa Clara County, and was 36 years of age.
Some years ago he married Miss Anna Bliss, the daughter of George D. Bliss,
who survives him with three small children. He was associated with his
brother. Samuel N. Rucker, in the furniture business in San Jose. Their business
was extensive ;ind the. deceased was also -interested in a number of furniture
agencies throughout Oregon and Washington. By his honesty and courtesy he
made a success in commercial life and was in most comfortable circumstances.
Mr. Rucker was also prominently identified with the Native Sons' organization,
and was the grand marshal at their last annual reunion, which was held in
San Jose.
Samuel N. Rucker, ex-Mayor of San Jose, and formerly a member of the
legislature, is a twin brother of the deceased. The likeness between them v i
so striking that not even thrir most intimate friends were able to tell them apart.
Mr. Rucker had a host of friends to whom his death will mean a personal loss.
He possessed those sterling characteristics of manhood that endeared him to all
with whom ho came in contact. The funeral will take place at 2 o'clock tins
afternoon from his late residence, and the interment will be in Calvary Ceme
tery.

CYCLISTS COLLIDE
WITH FEARFUL FORCE
Mrs. Walter B. Webster the Victim of
a Careless Youth.
MRS. WALTER B. WEBSTER met
with an accident while cycling in
Golden Gate Park yesterday that
may cost the lady her lite.
Mr. Webster, who is a department man
ager for W. W. Montague & Co., and his
wife started from their home at 416 Lyon
street about noon for a spin to the beach
on their wheels. They took the bicycle
path along the main road, Mrs. Webster
being some distance in front of her hus
band. The lady was going down the grade
near the westerly entrance to the speed
track wholly unconscious of danger, when
a boy of about 18 years dashed down the
path behind her at furious speed and
crashed into her wheel.
Mrs. Webster was thrown violently to
the ground, striking on her back. Sev
eral persons who witnessed the collision
hurried to the injured lady's assistance.
The park ambulance was summoned and
Mrs. Webster was hurried 10 the Emer
gency Hospital. Drs. Sweeney and Simon
made an examination and found she had
sustained severe injury to the spine, with
indications of a fracture, although that
could not be determined at the time.
Mrs. Webster was entirely conscious
and suffered little pain, though the lower
part of her body and limbs were para
lyzed, Mr. Webster eumpioned a carriage
city attended th* funeral and many floral
tributes were placed on the casket of the
j departed poet. Among: these was a hand
; some harp sent by the German Press
i Club, the members of which attended the
; services. Hon. Charles ' Bundschu dcliv
! ered a eulogy on the dead poet at the
I house and at the cemetery read a poem,
j by himself, entitled "The Last Tribute to
I the Dead Poet." M. Greenblatt, the pro
i prietor of the German Pemokrat, deliv
ered a eulogistic oration at the cemetery.
An instrumental quartet furnished the
music at the services.
The honorary pallbearers were: Consul
i General A. Rosr-nthal. F. W. Dohrmann,
: Charles Bundschu. Joseph Brandenstein,
: Dr. Dresel, M. Greenblatt, E. C. Preiber,
Dr. Saenger. Professor G. Goebel, Profes
sor William Zimmermann, Max Heilbronn,
, Professor A. Herbst, A. Schoeman and
M. . Wunsch.

medicinal use because It Is pure.
and the lady was removed to their home.
It will be a day or two yet before the
full extent of her Injuries can be deter
mined.
The boy who ran Mrs. Webster down
escaped without injury, and before those
who witnessed the affair could interfere
he had remounted his wheel and sped
swiftly away to the beach. The police
were unable to find him and nobody knew
who he was.
Earlier in the day S. H. Tarr of 1404
Van Ness avenue was run down by a bi
cyclist in the park and was treated at
the Park Hospital for a contusion on the
right side of the chest.
J. S. Morris of 414 Capp street fell off
his wheel while riding in the park and
tore some of the flesh from his hand and
knee. He, too, was patched up at the
hospital.
Late in the afternoon S. B. Davidson,
an elderly man. emerged from the park
panhandle onto Fell street, when he was
struck by a bicyclist and thrown to the
pavement with great violence. . He was
picked up unconscious and taken to the
Park Hospital, where he was soon re
stored sufficiently to depart for hia home.
The bicyclist, who declined to give his
name, was badly cut about the head and
mouth, but he pluckily rendered all the
assistance to Davidson that lay in his
power. The collision was purely acci
dental, for the old man stepped from the
badge directly In front of the wheelman*
