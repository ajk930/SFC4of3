MAJOR GENERAL LAWTON.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26.âThe War Department has received the follow
ing telegram from General Lawton, now on his way aboard the transport"
Grant with reinforcements for General Otis:
"COLOMBO. Feb. 25. âSituation unchanged since last cable. No serious'
illness; sick improving. Sail to-night for Singapore."'
<
MANILA, Feb. 26.â An
idea of the extent of
the loss by fires in the sub
urbs of Manila since Wed
nesday may be obtained
from the figures herewith
given: Sixty buildings of
stone and 150 substan
tial wooden structures with
iron roofs were destroy
ed. In addition 8000 nifa
houses of natives were
burned.
MANILA, Feb. 26.â Last night the i
rebels concentrated in such numbers j
near the Chinese cemetery that General
Mac Arthur anticipated, an attack and
asked for reinforcements. Two compa
nies of the Twenty-third regulars were
cent to Caloocan and a battalion of the j
Twentieth regulars to the cemetery at
about i- :dnight. But the expected at- j
tack was not made. The rebels, after,!
imaking a great noise with bugle calls
and yells of "Viva independencia" and
"Macho malo Americanos," and firing
volleys, disappeared in the woods.
It is believed their leaders are getting
desp ate and are attempting to force j
the I'nited State- troops to make an
attack, in the hope of breaking through j
the American lines, but the rebels are j
evidently unwilling to be pacified when i
facing the Americans. It is just possi- i
ble, however, '." it they may be goaded j
into such a move before more reinforce-
ments arrive.
All is quiet this afternoon inside and
outside of Manila, except near Caloo
can, where the enemy's sharpshooters
continue to annoy our troops at a com
paratively close range. One man of the
Twentieth Kansas Volunteers was
killed in Arequina village, which was
burned last night, and four were
. â wounded in the skirmish, one of the
Idaho, one of the Minnesota and two of
the Pennsylvania volunteer regiments.
No such emergency exists here as is
presented by reports circulated in the
United Statesâ and cabled back to
Manila â to the effect that Admiral
Dewey has had a collision of a forcible

WHAT THIS WAR CONGRESS
HAS SO FAR ACCOMPLISHED
It Has Covered a Most Eventful Period In the Country's
History, but Much Needed Legislation Remains
to Be Acted Upon.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26. âAn
eventful period in the coun
try's history is covered by the
work of the Fifty-fifth Con-
gress, which is drawing to a
close. It has been a period of stirring
and dramatic action, with questio-ns of
vast magnitude constantly engaging at
tention, forming an epoch alongside
those other American epochs, the
Revolution and the Civil War. This
Congress has declared war against a
foreign foe, and the treaty-making
branch has participated in ratifying
the treaty by which that war was ter
minated. It has provided a great vol
unteer army, has enlarged the regular
army and has expanded the navy to
meet war emergencies and new condi
tions.
The tariff has been revised, first by
the Dingley law and then by the war
revenue act; a bond issue known as
the war loan has been provided. But,
far reaching as these war measures are,
the Congress has had time also to enact
other legislation which under ordinary
circumstances would make its session
memorable. This includes the annexa
tion af Hawaii; the rejection by the
Senate of the general treaty of arbi
tration with Great Britain; the enact
ment of a national bankruptcy law;
provision for taking the twelfth cen
sus; reorganization of the personnel
of the navy. To this list may yet be
added other important subjects still
pending, including the Nicaragua canal,
the increase of the regular army, the
anti-scalping measure, the Hawaiian
bill and the proposed encouragement of
American shipping. Some of the most
important general measures are in the
final legislative stages and it will not
be until the last hours arrive that the
success or failure of these measures will
be determined definitely.
The present Congress began its work
almost simultaneously with the open
ing of President McKinley's adminis
tration. Two days after his inaugura
tion he issued the call for an extra ses
sion, and in pursuance of this call Con
gress assembled on March 1 ">. 1897. The
special message to CongTess was direct
ed to the need of a tariff law that
would provide ample revenue for the
support of the Government. No other
subject of legislation was mentioned,
and the tariff bill at once became the
all-absorbing feature of the session.
Chairman Dingley of the Ways and
Means Committee and his Republican
associates had already done much work
on the bill, and three days after the ex
tra session began the Dingley tariff bill
was reported. It passed the House
within two weeks of the opening of the
session; passed the Senate May 7; be
came a law July 24. Hardly less im
portant was the consideration in the
Senate of the general treaty of arbitra
tion negotiated by President Cleveland
with Great Britain. The progress of the
treaty in the executive sessions of the
Senate attracted world-wide attention,
finally resulting in the defeat of the
instrument. The extra session also
brought forth four appropriation bills,
but they were those which failed of
passage "in the preceding Congress, and
were not considered as properly charge
able to this Congress. Some general
legislation was enacted. including:
the suspension of President Cleve
land's order setting aside 21.
--000,000 acres of forest reserves:
providing for a gradual abandonment
of sectarian Indian schools; extend
ing relief to Mississippi flood sufferers
and to the destitute in Cuba and in
India. The Cuban problem began to
present an acute phase at this early
session and the Senate passed a reso
lution recognizing the Cubans as bel
ligerents, which, however, did not pass
the House.
The second session of the present
Congress is remembered as the great
war session. It saw the culmination
of the pent-up sympathy for suffering
Cuba; the declaration that the people
of Cuba ought to be and are free and
independent; the declaration of war
against Spain, and the enactment of
those vast emergency measures for
prosecuting the war. There were many
messages from the President as the
war clouds darkened, ranging from th*
submission of the report on the Maine
disaster to the call for a declaration
of war. The first real war legislation
was when Congress placed at the
disposal of the President. with
out limitation, $50,000,000 as an
emergency fund for national de
fense. On April 11 the President
committed the entire Cuban question to
Congress, and just one week later the
Congressional resolution became a law,
declaring Cuba free and independent,
demanding that Spain withdraw its
land and naval forces from Cuba and
Cuban waters and directing the use of
WHOLESALE MURDER
PLANNED AT MANILA
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gordon Bennett.
MANILA, Feb. 26.â Great encouragement to persist In war is given to the Philippine insurgents because
of the known existence in America of an anti-annexationiat party, and. a letter from an Insurgent official in
Manila to his chief at Malolos found on a dead man emphasized the great influence of these anti-annexation-
Ists. It was represented that they meditated the assassination of McKinley. In view of these facts the letter
urged the prosecution of a guerrilla war by the Filipinos.
The terrible crisis through %\hich the city has passed and the admirable work of the provost marshal, Gen
eral Hughes, is shown by the order of the insurrectionist Government at Malolos to the officers of militia of bola
men in Manila. This order is now in the hands of the authorities here. The document says substantially that
on February 15 the territorial militia were to be on the streets of Manila armed for action with bolas, revolvers
and rifles; that Filipino families only were to be respected and th^se were not to be molested, but all other in
dividuals of whatsoever race were to be killed wfthout pity. After the extermination of the American forces,
the order further says, an attack from outsiders was to* be the signal for an uprising in various quarters of Ma
nila.
The order ends by saying that the war on Americans should be without quarter because Americans have
betrayed them. It is signed by Sandego, Minister of the Interior. It orders the murder of the whole foreign
population of Manila. Such is Aguinaldo's government.
our land and naval forces to enforce the
resolutions. Within another week, viz.,
April 24, the declaration of war was
passed by Congress and approved. Then
came the rush of war legislation on a
stupendous scale, the work proceeding
while actual hostilities were under way
and the Dewey victory was achieved.
The act creating the volunteer army
had been approved three days before
the declaration of war, and under it
the President was enabled to call into
service the 250,000 men augmenting the
regular forces. The latter, also, had
been expanded and improved by the
act establishing the three battalion
formation in time of war. A further
force was provided by authorizing the
enlistment of 10,000 men adapted to
tropical climate, since known as "im
munes." Another act added two addi
tional artillery regiments to the regu
lar army, with a total of 1610 men.
These and many lesser army measures
were speedily enacted.
With these war measures were the
important acts for raising revenue ade
quate to meet the vast war expendi
tures. The first of these was the war
revenue act, designed to raise $150,000.
--000, and in this connection Congress au
thorized a bond issue of $200,000,000,
known as the "war loan." After news
of the Dewey victory was received,
resolutions of thanks to the victor were
passed, and Congress authorized the
presentation of a sword to him and
medals to his officers.
Although the second session was ab
sorbed with the war, there was time
for much important general legislation.
The annexation of Hawaii was accom
plished by a resolution, the treaty of
annexation not having been ratified in
the Senate. A general bankruptcy law
was enacted, providing for both volun
tary and involuntary bankruptcy.
Other general measures enacted were:
Prohibiting the killing of seals in the
North Pacific and importation of seal
skins Into this country; appropriating
$473,171 to settle the Bering Sea arbi
tration; relieving suffering miners in
the Yukpn; establishment of an indus
trial commission.
The total appropriation of the sec
ond or war session footed almost $900,
--000.000, of which upward of $350,000,000
was for purely war purposes.
The present or third session of the
Fifty-fifth Congress dealt with those
far-reaching results growing out of the
war. The most important of these was
the consideration of the peace treaty in
the Senate. The treaty was transmit
ted to the Senate by the President on
the 4th of January. It was then re
ferred to the Committee on Foreign Re
lations, and after being held for just a
week by the committee was reported
back to the Senate on the 11th of Janu
ary. The Senate had the treaty under
consideration for less than a month,
the vote on ratification being taken on
the 6th of February. There was intense
interest in the progress of the question
from the beginning of the discussion
until the close, and this interest was
intensified by the doubt felt as to the
result of the vote. When the Senate
went into executive session on the 6th
of February, half an hour before the
time set for the final vote, the friends
of the treaty were certain of only fifty
five of the fifty-six votes necessary to
insure the adoption of the resolution
of ratification. Soon afterward they
secured promises from Senators Jones
of Nevada and McEnery of Louisiana,
and when the vote was taken the result
stood 57 ayes to 27 noes, or one vote
more than was necessary under the re
quirements of a two-thirds majority.
While the treaty w r as exclusively be
fore the Senate the House had some in
direct participation with subjects cov
ered by the treaty. As the branch
originating all revenue measures it pro
vided an appropriation of $20,000,000 to
pay Spain, according to the terms of
the treaty. This was first proposed as
an amendment to the sundry civil bill,
but was ruled out on technical grounds.
Later It passed as an independent
measure. Efforts were made to add to
it a declaration of the policy of the
Government as to the Philippines, but
this was defeated by the overwhelming
vote of 213 to 34. The resolution of
Senator McEnery, declaring the policy
toward the Philippines, came to the
House and was referred to the Commit
tee on Foreign Affairs, but no final ac
tion is probable.
Another Important measure resulting
from the war is that known as
the Hull bill, or the Hull-Hawley
bill, for the Increase and reorganization
of the regular army. Following the
new conditions arising; two plans of
army increase were presented to Con
gress. The House Military Committee
first .took up tl. s subject, and after elab
orate hearings presented through Chair
man Hull a bill having the approval of
the War Department. It increased the
army to approximately 100.000 men.
When considered in the House the
grade of lieutenant general was
struck out. discretion was given
the President to reduce the size of com
panies so that the total force would
be about 60,000 men. and some other
amendments were made, but the bill
substantially as presented was passed.
In the Senate the Committee on Mili
tary Affairs divided equally on the bill.
General Hawley, the chairman, and four
others reporting a bill similar. to that
presented in the House, while five other
Senators made a minority report, op
posing the proposed increase and sug
gesting a plan of temporary continu
ance of the military establishment at
62,000 men, with an additional force of
35,000 men to be used in outlying in
sular possessions. The latest. phase of
the subject is presented in a compro
mise presented by the party leaders in
the Senate after conferring with the
executive authorities. The compromise
proposes only a slight permanent in
crease in the regular army, as given by
detail, and authorize* the President, un
til July 1, 1899, to maintain the army
at 65,000 men, and to raise a force of
not more than 35.000 volunteer infantry
organized as thirty regiments. This
plan is now pending before the Senate.
These several propositions have aroused
wide differences, and it will not be until
the last days of the session, if at all,
that the final form of the measure can
be determined.
The Nicaragua canal question also
has' taken a prominent place in the
work of this session. At the outset
Morgan had the subject made the un
finished business of the Senate, and
with this right of way it was kept con
stantly before the Senate, when not in
executive session, until finally passed.
The essential feature of the Morgan
bill provides that the United States
shall participate in the construction of
the canal, subscribing for 925.000 shares
at $100 each, out of a total of 1.000.000.
and that the work of the Maritime
Canal Company of Nicaragua, in exe
cuting the work, . shall be practically
under the direction of, the United
States: When this- bill â¢ reached the
House Committee on Commerce all after
the enacting clause Nicaragua, out and
the work, shall be practically
the direction of the United
, When this bill reached the
Committee on Commerce all after
acting clause was struck out and
what is known as the Hepburn p]an,
drafted by Representative Hepburn of
lowa, chairman of the House Commit
tee on Interstate and Foreign Com
merce, substituted. The essential feat
ure of the Hepburn substitute is mak
ing the canal exclusively a Govern
ment undertaking. It authorizes the
President to acquire by purchase from
Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the terri
tory necessary, "to excavate and con
struct, control and defend, a canal."
etc. Such sum as is necessary for pur
chasing the right of way is appropri
ated. . When the route is thus secured
the President is authorized to have. the
Secretary of War excavate and con
struct the canal from a point near
Greytown, via. Lake Nicaragua, to a
point, near Brito, on the Pacific. The
sum of $115,000,000 is appropriated for
the completion of the work authorized.
As it was feared the lateness of the
session might prevent consideration of
either, the Morgan bill or the Hepburn
plan in the House various plans were
adopted to secure action by way of one
of the general appropriation bills. The
first movement of this kind was when
Hepburn offered his plan as an amend
ment to the sundry civil bill. After
animated discussion the amendment
was ruled out of order, and on an ap
peal from this decision the chairman,
Hopkins, was sustained. The next
move wag made in the Senate, when,
at the instance of Morgan, the Commit
tee on Commerce presented an amended
form of the Hepburn plan as an amend
ment to the' river and harbor bill. The
canal amendment reported from the
Senate Commerce Committee as an
amendment to the river and harbor bill
was agreed to by the Senate and the
bill passed. It is now before the House
Committee on . Rivers and Harbors,
with the outcome in doubt on the canal
item and the bill as a whole. - â¢
The bill providing for taking the
twelfth census was first passed by the
Senate and provided a comprehensive
plan for executing this important work.
When the measure reached the House
a substitute was presented. The House
measure differs from that of the Sen
ate mainly in making the census bu
reau an irdependent organization not
Under Che Interior Department and in
the method of appointments.
An important measure which has
passed both houses and doubtless will
become a law is known as the "naval
personnel" bill, and is entitled a bill
to reorganize and increase the effi
ciency of the personnel of the navy, and
the marine corps. Its main features
were drawn up by a board of emi
nent naval officers and were designed
to overcome the stagnation in some of
the grades, to expand the personnel to
keep pace with the up- building of the
new navy and to reorganize the marine
corps. It passed the House and the
Senate in amended form and is pass
ing through the final stages of confer
ence.
The Hawaiian bill was presented to
both branches of Congress, having been
framed by the Hawaiian commission
appointed by the President, with a
view to carrying out the Congressional
resolution annexing Hawaii. It pro

FRANCE HOT
ON THE TRAIL
OF ROYALISTS
Dupuy's Cabinet May Dis
solve the League of
Patriots.
Deroulede Anxious for a Heavy
Sentence That Will Crown Him
With a Martyr's Halo.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gordon
Bennett.
PARIS, Feb. 26.â There is
only one man in France who
takes Paul Deroulede's escape
tragically, and that is Deroulede
himself. He is anxious for a
sensational trial with a heavy
sentence that will crown him with
a martyr's halo for his followers.
He accordingly is doing all he can
to exaggerate his offense by de
claring verbally to officials his de
sign to overturn the republic and
writing letters to the same effect.
Nobody else, however, looks
upon him as anything but a lu
natic. As a journalist here said
to-day the worst punishment that
could be given Deroulede would
be to sentence him to be confined
as non compos mentis, and one
is compelled to admit that this
would be making the punishment
fit the crime.
There seems some probability
that the Ligue dcs Patriotes may
be dissolved. Yesterday in parlia
mentary circles it was held that
action in this direction was. about
to be taken by the Dupuy Cabi
net. How much truth there is
in the rumor it is hard to say, but
it would not be astonishing if all
leagues were dissolved by order,
as after all they are only royalist
or imperialist camps in disguise.
FRENCH DETECTIVES
SHADOW ROYALISTS
Special Table to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gordon
Bennett.
BRUSSELS. Feb. 26.â The Due d'Or
leans, who came to Brussels six days
ago to watch events in Paris, last even
ing took the train to Turin, confessing
that he had no chance against the re
public. He allowed an interview, in
which he asserted that M. Deroulede
had not acted on the Royalist account,
but on the contrary had blundered ter
ribly and destroyed Royalist chances.
During the whole of the Duke's stay
in Brussels, where he led a quiet, un
eventful life, he has been watched and
followed, step by step, by French de
tectives, some in disguise, some riding
bicycles and some on foot. One suc
ceeded in passing himself off as a Paris
ian monarchical journalist and inter
viewed the Duke, who confided his
hopes to him.
Prince Victor Napoleon Is considered
here a much more serious pretender,
because less impatient, more dignified
and absolutely silent. He also is
watched by French detectives. They
learned that he often drives an au
tomobile and sometimes even ven
tures a few miles into French terri
tory. So they got an automobile from
Paris to follow him in case of need.
One notable feature of the stay of
the Due d'Orleans is that although he
went to the royal palace of the Count
of Flanders he was neither received by
the King nor the King's brother. He
only received a visit from the Duke of
Vendome. It is believed that the King
discreetly advised him through the lat
ter to prolong his stay in Belgium as
little as possible.
TURIN. Feb. 26.â The Due d'Orleans
arrived here this evening from Brussels.
RAIDS ON ROYALISTS
BY THE SECRET POLICE
PARIS, Feb. 26. â In consequence of
the placarding throughout the city of
speeches of the Due d'Orleans, the Or
leanist pretender, recently delivered at
San Remo. and the seizure of scarf Dins
and medals bearing the pretender's
portrait, the Prefect of Police was or
dered by the Government to make
strict investigation into the recent pro
ceedings of the Monarchist party.
Last evening the Prefect communi
cated the result of his inquiries to M.
Dupuy, with the result that the Min
ister decided upon vigorous action. At
midnight M. Cochefort, chief of the
secret police, was summoned to the
Prefecture and directed to prepare sev
enteen confidential letters and seven
teen warrants, which were handed to
seventeen police commissaries author
izing a search of the residences of sus
pects, particularly M. Guerin. manager
of the newspaper Anti-Juif, MM.
Depaux Buffet, Robert de Chavilly,
Thiebaud de Moncourt, secretary to the
Due d'Orleans; Dubuc, president of the
â¢Young Anti-Semites, and Comte Sab
ran Ponteves.
The confidential letters Indicated that
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
the warrants aimed to discover the exÂ«
istence of any political action on the
part of anti-Semite leaders in their re
lations with the Royalists and Bona
partislsts 1 committees with the other
leagues.
No other incident occurred in the
course of the domiciliary visits. This
morning M. Buffet, who represents the
Due d'Orleans, vigorously protested
against the violation of his domicile,
and declared that the Royalist party
would always conspire, even if threat
ened with imprisonment. Many docu
ments were seized at M. Buffet's resi
dence.
Quantities of propagandist pamphlets
and portraits of the Due d'Orleans, a
list of members of the Royalist com
mittee and voluminous correspondence
were seized at the headquarters of the
Royalist committee in the Fauborg St.
Honore and at the residence of Comte
Sabran de Ponteves. The commissary
who visited M. de Moncourt surprised
him just as he had returned from Brus
sels with letters from the Due d'Or
leans addressed to Royalist personages
and instructions from the pretender to
his supporters. All these were seized.
M. Thiebaud expressed surprise at
the proceedings against, him, on the
ground that he belonged neither to the
Royalist committee nor the Anti-Semit
ic league.
Altogether a large quantity of docu
ments were secured and placed under
seal. All whose residences were
searched denied the possession of com
promising documents, but it is be
lieved the raids will be continued.
In consequence of an announcement
that demonstrations were Intended to
be made at the Vendome column, thirty
agents of the police were posted in the
vicinity to-day. About 3 o'clock this
afcernoon people began to arrive with
bouquets of violets. Five who threw
flowerÃ within the railing surrounding:
tne column were promptly placed under
arrest, though released soon after # on
giving their names and addresses to
the police. Henceforth demonstrators
will be allowed to promenade with em
blems, but not to approach the column.

for a very curious offense.
A few days ago people passing tha

I were astonished to behold the Minister of
War in uniform surmounted by a shin

withstanding the royal smiles General
Rappe was ordered under arrest for three

BURNS REFUSES
TO YIELD TO HIS
PARTY'S DEMANDS
"Rule or Ruin" Is the Motto Adopted
by the Mexican.
A BREAK LOOKED FOR THIS WEEK
Growing Belief That He Will Not Be Able to
Keep Some of His Followers in Line
More Than a Few Days Longer.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 26.â "Rule or ruin" is the
motto of Dan Burns. He proposes to be
â¢1 I'nited States Senator, or, failing
in that, to prevent the election of any
body else.-
Should he In bringing about his
election the Republican party in the State
:':ifornia would be dealt a blow from
which it would not recover for many
years. Should he succeed in making a
deadlock the Injury would be great, but
not beyond remedy. The result in- Ore
gon, where the Republicans chose to
leave the State without one of its Sena
tors for two years, rather than to elect
an unworthy one for six years, shows
that the people approve of such a policy.
Aa it was there, so it will be here. â If
Burns makes a deadlock the blame -will
be his. Should he fee elected the blame
â will be on the party.
Fortunately, from the present outlook,
there is no reason to fear either result.
Xow thai the closing days of the session
are at hand and there is still no prospect
of a realization of the many promises
that Burns has heralded from week to
week, through the medium of his army
of touts, even his own followers have
awakened to the knowledge that his
cause is hopeless and that the State is to
be saved from the misfortune of his elec
tion.
Not only this, but it Is equally apparent
that he wiil be unable to prevent the elec
tion of some more acceptable candidate.
There has not been a week since the be
ginning of the session that the Burns
lieutenants have not announced that on
Borne particular day of the following- week
Burns would marshal his reserve forces
and receive his election at the hands of a
majority of the members of the Legisla
ture. On the strength of these promises
Burns' followers have celebrated ap
proaching victory on occasions too nu
merous to mention. They -are now look
ing back on this long vista of glorifica
tions with anything but kindly feelings,
and it is safe to say that it will take
something more substantial than promises
to induce the colonel's friends to repeat in
the future the follies of the past.
To-night the Legislature and politicians
who gather jn the hotel corridors are
telling each other that there is "some
thing doing" and that the present week
will be big with events.
What the "sotriething" is, none of them
can say, but the .belief is prevalent that
whatever happens will make itself ap
parent in the Burns' camp, and that it
will not be to Burns' advantage. Some Of
the San Francisco members, who haVe
been voting for Burns, have been mur
muring more or le.Â«s openly for a week or
more against the situation in which they
find themselves. These men say they
have no objection in voting for Burns as
long as they believe the power that is
behind him can force him into the Sena
torship in spite of all obstacles, but they
rebel against being crucified when there
Is no chance of being able to reap an
adequate reward. They' say that almost
two month have elapsed since the Legis
lature was convened and Burns has fail
ed to show any of the strength of which
he boasted. Their present uneasiness is
caused by a growing conviction that
Burns intends to hold their votes to the
end that he may succeed in carrying out
his threat that if he cannot be elected
he will block the election of any other
candidate.
It was -iven out around town to-night
that Assemhlym.in McDonald of Alamedu
will change his vote from Grant to Burns
to-morrow. Some color was given the .sto
ry by a general knowledge of the fact that
for some time past strong pressure has
been brought to bear on the Assemblyman
to induce him to enter the Burns camp.
Friends of Mr. Grant, however, insist that

Passing of a Warrior Who Performed

Sixties.
WASHINGTON.' Feb. 28.â Major Gen

Is dead, aged 77 years. A month ago Gen
eral Reynolds had -an attack of paralysis,
which culminated In a cerebral hemor
rhage, causing death- late yesterday.
After the beginning of the civil war
Reynolds rose rapidly in rank from cold-
Tif\ of the Tenth Indiana Volunteers to
major general of volunteers. During the
time he was in command at Camp Mor

tain District. W. Va. In Tennessee he
was engaged in thf actions at Hovers

Chatanooga. Later he commanded the
division of New Orleans, was in com
mand of the Nineteenth Army Corps and
aFHi^t^d in organizing forces for the cap
ture of Mobile and for Games and Mor

General Reynolds was later in command
of the Mississippi River from its mouth
to Memphis. He was mustered- out of
the volunteer service in 1566 and reap
pointed colonel in the regular army in the
same year. He was brevetted brigadier

In the absence of definite information
concerning the future programme of
I Burns, there are whispered conjectures
, to-night regarding the course he will pur
i sue to maintain a show of leadership in
i the party. One of the most prominent
workers in Grant's camp, and a man \vn.i
keeps as well posted as to what is going
on in the Burns corral as any outsider
can, says there is not the slightest doubt,
of Burns' defeat. In summing up the sit
uation ho remarked: .
"I never did believe that Burns could
I ever get the forty-three votes that he
claimed, even counting the Democrats,
who were reported to be for him. Early
in the session I wagered money that he
would not get more than thirty-two votes
without a caucus. Burns now recog
nizes that he is a loser, and I have reason
to believe that his next move will be to
bring out a new man. It is reasonable to
suppose that falling to win the fight for
himself he will seek to name the Senator
and be in a position to say to his friends:
'Owing to the extreme bitterness of the
war waged against me. I could not har
monize the elements and win out myself,
but I named the Senator.'
"I have an idea that Burns will seek to
bring Estee forward and endeavor to
bring Democrats to his support. Perhaps
Burns himself may not care whether the
deadlock is broken if he (Burns) cannot
win, but the railroad people may not care
to take the bla.me of adjourning the Legis
lature without the election of a Senator.
The man in reserve may not be Estee, but
I have good reason for the belief that
Burns will present a candidate before
many days." .
There is gloom in the corral to-night.
The touts are not claiming success and
naming the day of triumph, but they do
expect some gains this week, and their
claims in this regard are not disputed by
men who keep well posted. It is regard
ed as reasonably certain that one of
Bulla's supporters will enter the corral,
but he may be holding back to go in with
a bunch of three or four.
The Grant camp does not disintegrate
as the touts expected. In the efforts to
capture. Grant men Burns has encountered
obstacles that he never supposed would
confront him. Word comes to-night that
the Grant forces are not only firm, but
confident.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1899.
"DISGRACE TO THE STATE."
Burns' Senatorial Candidacy De
nounced From Two Pulpits.
OAKLAND, Feb. 26.â "There are men in
the State Legislature who have not tne
backbone to stand up like men when the
party lash is wielded over them; men
who have not the backbone to vote
against a corrupt man, such as -j^an
Burns, who brazenly aspires to the high
honor of United States Senator. I fear
some of these men, lacking backbone,
who dare not disobey their constituents
publicly and openly, will in caucus secretr
ly vote for Dan Burns."
The. speaker was Rev. Dr. E. R. Dille,
pastor of the First M. E. Chur.ch, andhis
unique subject was "Backbone." The
well-pointed utterance was a final rebuke
aimed at the dilatory and undecided ac
tion of the Legislature in the important
duty of electing a United States Senator.
To a Call reporter Dr. Dille stated after
ward that he had not intended to refer
to the Senatorial situation when he com
menced his sermon to-night, but the title
of his discourse called up the present
state of affairs, and the utterance was
impromptu, spontaneous and apropos.
"The men who compose our State
Legislature are now surely aware or the
sentiment of the people," said Dr. Dille,
â¢'and I do not see how they can ignore
their constituents. To my mind, the ob
ject of this protracted delay is the hope
Burns' friends have of electing him, tne
accomplishment of which would be a
burning shame and disgrace to the fair
name of ' California."

BURNS THE ANTITHESIS OF WASHINGTON.
Rev. Frederic C. Lee Vividly Contrasts the Noble Qualities
of the Statesman and Patriot With the Political
Trickery of the Senatorial Aspirant.
Â«F there is anywhere about
I the halls of the Capitol at
1 Sacramento a portrait of the
father of his country, I hope
they have had the decency to
turn its face to the wa.l.
Why?
Because a man is known by
the company he keeps, and
George Washington cannot af
ford at this late date to lose
his well-earned and time-hon
ored reputation.
Would you look upon the
full-length portrait of a pa
triot? Go stand before the
picture of Washington. Pat
riotism, nobility, man
hood culminated here. The
genius of Washington was the
genius of patriotism. If Plato
stands for pure thought, De
mosthenes for oratory, Lin
coln for liberty, Washington
represents civic devotion â
which is patriotism.
Can you picture him as a
barroom brawler? Can you
think of him as a defaulter?
Can you imagine him bully
ing, or bribing, or buying a
seat in the Senate, though in
possession of all the mines in
Mexico P
PLEASE state that my object Is not
to talk politics in the sense of par
tisanship. The pulpit and the minis
try should never bo thus degraded;
It Is the duty of the church, through its
ministry, to take high grounds and give
forth no uncertain sounds along the lines
of truth, purity and righteousness. There
is a right and a wrong, a good and a bad
side in affairs of state as well as in af
fairs of business and religion. Nothing
can be practically right that is morally,
wrong, and the political evils of our day
are moral evils. .
"Bribery, theft, fraud, drunkenness,
immorality. Is the preacher of the
gospel who says 'thou shalt not steal, lie,
bear false witness.' to hold his peace?
If he is to cry aloud and warn men against
stealing, lying, bribe-taking, and the
political offender in all these things is to
be exempt, then I and every other
minister of the irospel, priest and bishop
should lay down out credentials, for, like
Othello, our occupation is gone.
"Is there any difference between steal
ing sheep and stealing votes? Yet we are
so mixed in our ethics that the man who
steals cattle is sent to' San Quentin, while
the man who steals vbtes by bribery and
political 'knock out drops* is sent to
Sacramento and "Washington. Now
which is the greater criminal? Which
of the twain is more dangerous to so
ciety?
"Representatives and Senators in the
Legislature assembled at Sacramento,
hear me! You cannot show any respect
for yourself or your party by voting for
a man alive physically, but morally dead
and politically corrupt to the core. Tne
worth and the strength of a nation de
pend far less upon its form of govern
ment than upon the character of its men.
National prosperity and progress is the
sum of individual industry, energy and
uprightness, while national decay is in
dividual idleness, vice and selfishness.
"I ask the question that The Call asked
some time ago. What has this man Burns
ever done in public or private life that he
should pose as a fit person to represent
our State in the United States Senate?
Has he marked ability as a statesman or
ister of the gospel in the State of Califor
nia to denounce from his pulpit the Sena
torial aspirations of Dan Burns and all
his followers," said Rev. F. S. Brush to a
Call reporter to-day. A few weeks ago
in a sermon entitled "Partisan Politics
vs. Political Manhood," Rev. Mr. Brush
dealt with the man from Mexico in most
scathing terms. . He says that since that
sermon was delivered he has received
letters from all sections of the State
written by men in all walks of life con
gratulating- him upon the stand he took.
"This convinces me," continued Rev.
. Mr. Brush, "that the sentiment of the peo
pleâthat is, the best people, who are edu-
I cated, read the daily papers and think for
themselves, is unanimously against such
a man as Burns. It could not be other
wise. No self-respecting man â no man
who takes pride in the State â wants to see
it represented at "Washington by a man
who, if all we learn is true, should be j
doing time in a penitentiary.
"1 believe the ministers' should take a.
stand against such a candidate for the
moral welfare of the State. It would be
demoralizing to the rising generation if ,
Burns should, by any misfortune, be suc
cessful. It would teach young men that ]
the only road to greatness was corrup- i
tion and wrong- doing. There are plenty j
of honest men after the Senatorshfp and |
it is a reflection upon the legislators that ;
Burns is allowed tv get even a single vote I

the reverend gentleman said that if there

WANTS THE OREGON TO
PREVENT INTERFERENCE
NEW YORF. Feb. 26.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: It is because of his desire
to be prepared for emergencies and to
prevent interference by the moral ef
fect of a formidable naval force that
Rear Admiral Dewey sent a hurry caJl
for the Oregon.
While officials of the department deny
that any explanation has been received
from Rear Admiral Dewey as to the
"political reasons" which induced him
to ask that the Oregon be sent to Man
ila at once, they make this statement
with the confidence borne of knowledge
of the situation.
In German diplomatic circles there is
a disposition to resent the insinuations
which have been made that Rear Ad
miral Dewey's call for the Oregon was
based upon his apprehension that the
German government contemplated in
terfering. I was informed that the Ger
man government has given repeated
assurances that it recognized the sover^
eignty of the 'United States over the
Philippines and had no intention of
committing any action respecting the
islands which would be distasteful to
the Washington authorities. Germany
has but two ships to-day in the Philip
pines â the Kaiserin Augusta and Irene
â not a large number when it is consid
ered that much of the trade of the
islands is in tho hands of German mer
chants, and that besides protecting
German subjects and merchants Ad
miral yon Diedrichs has to take care
of the subjects and interests of four
other European countries.
There is a disposition to believe that
Germany, at the slightest opportunity,
will land marines at Manila. As a mat
ter of fact, I was told that German
: marines would only be landed in the
| event that General Otis requested such
| action. According to a diplomat with
| whom I talked, General Otis has an
j nounced that he will provide protection
to foreign subjects and their interests.
He is therefore responsible for their
safety. Should developments occur
1 showing that he is unable to provide
; such protection, then he may call upon
j foreign admirals to land marines, or if
| it becomes generally recognized that he
is unable to meet the situation then
marines may be landed merely for the
j purpose of protecting immediate prop-
I erty of foreign residents. With such a
I large force guarding Manila and sub
urbs, with reinforcements near at
hand and with a large fleet in the bay
the legislators had had the decency to
turn it to the wall.
The Examiner article is as herewith
reproduced:
"If there is anyhere about the halls of
the Capitol at Sacramento a portrait of
the 'Father of his Country.' I hope they
have had thp decency to turn its face to
the wall. "Why?
"Because a man Is known by the com
pany he keeps, and George Washington
cannot afford at this late date to lose his
weli-earned and tim^-honored reputation.
"Would you look upon the full-length
portrait of a patriot? Go stand before the
picture of Washington. Patriotism, no
bility, manhood culminated here. The
genius of Washington was the genius of
patriotism. If Plato stands for pure
thought, Demosthenes for oratory, Lin
coln for liberty. Washington represents
civic devotionâ which is patriotism.

INDIANS QUARREL
AND ONE IS DEAD
Two Others Seriously Wounded
in an Affray in a Grove Near
Sebastopol.
SANTA ROSA, Feb. 26.â An Indian named "Little Pete" was mur
dered by Indians this morning during a quarrel at Calder's Grove, near
Sebastopol. Two other Indians were badly wounded. Nothing Was
known of the trouble until an Indian called a Sebastopol doctor to
see "Pete." 'Sheriff Grace and deputies have left for the scene to arrest
the guilty persona.
to support the army, no members of the
diplomatic corps have apprehension
that any serious danger menaces the
subjects and interests of their govern
ments.
Though it has been some time now
since the event occurred, an explana
tion was given me to-day of the action
of the Germans last summer in bring
ing a transport into the harbor of Man
ila. It appears the German govern
ment had sent a large number of men
to Admiral yon Diedrieha to replace
those on board his ships whose terms
of sea duty had expired. "Would the
admiral have taken from his ships men
who had been trained to fight them if
he had expecteu a conflict with Ameri
can men-of-war?" asked my informant.
Well informed naval officers are of
the opinion that there is at present
nothing on the horizon to make Rear
Admiral Dewey apprehend foreign in
terference. But the burning of property
by the insurgents has made possible the
landing of marines to protect foreign
interests, and Rear Admiral Dewey, to
prevent this, or even the suggestion of
interference, with the encouragement
which would thus be given the insur
gents, cabled t,o the department that It
â would be wise to order the Oregon to
Join him as promptly as possible.
ADMIRAL CERVERA HAD

MADRID, Feb. 26.â The newspapers

ALGER`S POSITION
Gold Democrats Want
Recognition.
ASK FOR A CABINET PLACE
ALLEGED OFFER MADE TO THE
PRESIDENT.
Eastern Newspapers Will Cease At
tacks on the Administration if
Clevelandism Be Recog
nized.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Feb. 26.â A Washington
special to the Inter Ocean says: The
persistent fight made on Secretary Alger
by certain New York and New England
newspapers Has a two-foid purpose.
First, it is to discredit the administra
tion, of which Alger is a member. Sec
ond, there is a desire to force upon the
President a rearrangement of his Cab
inet and give recognition to the Cleve
land Democracy.
Two members of Mr. Cleveland's last
Cabinet have been indirectly suggested
to the President as able to quiet criti
cism of the War Department if either
should be placed at its head as Secre
tary of War. These two men are the
closest and most ardent friends of Mr.
Cleveland. They are ex-Secretary of
State Olney and ex-Secretary of War
Lament. Both are gold Democrats, and
mi-re bitter in their opposition to the
Democratic party as now organized
than are the Republicans. They are
representative.- of "t 'Ir-velandism" and
"the gold standard."
Eastern newspapers which represent
the Geld Democrats and have been con
tinually abusing President McKinley
because he has not tried to have Con
gress carry out Secretary Gages pet
schemes for currency reform are mak
ing the campaign against Secretary
Alger at this time with the hope that
they can frighten the President intu
preparing for the next campaign by
conciliating the Cleveland Democrats
and taking one of them into the Cabi
net.
Chief among these papers which have
abused McKinley over Alger"s shoulder
is the New York Herald, of which
James Gordon Bennett of New York
and Paris is owner and editor. To-day
it became kno-wn that Bennett has had
it made known to the President that
the Herald is ready to drop its light
upon the administration if Alger be re
moved and either Lamont or Olney
named as his successor in the Cabinet.
In this Bennett is imitating to a certain
extent his father, who in 1862 practi
cally compelled Lincoln to remwe Sec
retary of War Cameron and name as
his successor Edwin M. Stanton, a
Democrat who had served in Bu
chanan's Cabinet as Attorney General.
But Bennett has another object. His
only politics is gold. If he can dictate
the Secretary of War he can control
him, and through him the valuable con
cessions which will be made through
the war office in Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippines while they are under
military control.
Through the same channel by which
McKinley was notified of Bennett's
wishes it was also made known to the
President that the influence of the
Cleveland democracy and mugwump
press would not be insigniricant in the
next campaign, and also that, having
ignored their demands as to the cur
rency by not calling- an extra session
to enact currency legislation along the
lines suggested by Secretary Gage, he
cannot hope to hold this support unless
he does something to show his friend
ship for them and their opinions.

O NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â Dr. O

O O
00000000000000000
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â At 10:20
o'clock last night the following bulletin
was issued:
Mr. Kipling's condition remains the
same as at last reports.
E. G. JANEWAY.
THEODORE DUNHAM.
It was said at that hour that Mr.
Kipling was very low and unconscious.
This bulletin was the last authentic
news from the sick room. There were
the usual rumors about the hotel, some
perhaps founded on the actual condition
of the patient, but it was hard to gather
even a small quantity of hope from
them. It is riot an exaggeration to say
that at 2 o'clock this morning all were
prepared for the worst. Dr. Janeway
and Dr. Dunham were with the patient
at that hour, and had been almost con
tinuously throughout the night.
There was a general impression about
the hutel last evening that Mr. Kip
ling's condition was worse than at any
time since he became ill. Dr. Janeway
arrived at the hotel at 3:30 p. m., and as
he was not expected until later in the
afternoon it looked as if there had been
a sudden change for the worse and that
the physician had been called. He re
mained in the hotel until 4:15 and then
left, returning in a half hour. Almost
at the same time an oxygen tank was
brought to the hotel and taken up to
the Kipling apartments on the first
floor. That the oxygen was to be ad
ministered was practically admitted by
Dr. Janeway. This is heroic treatment,
and is resorted to only in extreme cases.
Both Dr. Janeway and Dr. Dunham
were with Mr. Kipling alternately
throughout Saturday night, and both
were in attendance on him early yester
day morning. At 9:30 o'clock yesterday
the following bulletin was issued:
Rudyard Kipling remains in a critical
condition. The disease continues.
E. G. JANEWAY,
THEODORE DUNHAM.
Soon after 10 o'clock Dr. Janeway Jr.,
son of Dr. E. Janeway, was called in
consultation concerning the critical
condition of Mr. Kipling. Dr. Dunham
came from the sick chamber soon after
11 o'clock. His wife is a sister of Mrs.
Kipling.
"Is Mr. Kipling suffering from pneu
monia?" Dr. Dunham was asked.
â¢We will call it inflammation of the
lungs." he replied.
"If he gets through to-day will he be
safer*
"If he gets through to-day he will
be much nearer to safety," said Dr.
Dunham.
At 4:30 o'clock the following bulletin
was posted:
Mr. Kipling still remains in a very criti
cal condition.
Dr. Janeway would not say anything
about Mr. Kipling's condition, sayine
there was nothing to add to the bulle
tin. It was learned, however, from
other sources that Kipling was ex
tremely weak. At times he recognizes
those around him. Those at the bed
side are Dr. Dunham, Mrs. Kipling, her
mother, Mrs. Balestier, Mr. Doubleday,
the children and two nurses.
An order has been issued from the
hotel office that no letters nor' notes
shall be sent to the room unless they
are of the utmost importance, and
then only when the names of the send
ers are known. There is a constant
stream of visitors at the Grenoble ask
ing for information about the author.
One clerk is kept busy receiving cards.
Some of the callers were admitted yes
terday morning to the sick chamber.
Among these favored were: W. D.
Howells, Nikola Tesla, S. S. McClure
and Charles Battell Loomis.
The following bulletin was issued at
7 o'clock last night:
Mr. Kipling's condition has been very
serious during this, the sixth day of the
disease, giving rise to the gravest appre
hension for the outcome.
E. G. J AN E\\ Ai ,
THEODORE DUNHAM.
At that hour the physicians were
making almost constant use of oxygen.
Their demeanor indicated a most criti
cal stage of the disease. Mr. Kipling
was delirious when the bulletin was
issued. _____

SEATTLE. Wash., Feb. 26.â A telegram
from Trenton. N. J.. says that articles in
corporating the .Vashlngton Power Trans

a number of capitalists of New York and
Boston. The company has a eaoital stock
of $1,750,000 and it is formed for the pur
pose of developing hydraulic and electric
power at Cedar River Falls, in this State,
for use in Tacoma. Seattle and other
cities of Puget Sound. It is thought that
the General Electric Company is back of
the corporation and that it is the first step
in a contest between the General Electric

WHAT THIS WAR
CONGRESS HAS SO
PAR ACCOMPLISHED
Continued from First Page.
vides a comprehensive plan of territor
ial government and fixes the qualifi
cation of electors and officers. The bill
has not, however, passed either branch
of Congress, and although regarded as
one of the important pieces of pend
ing legislation it is hardly expected
that it can pass all the stages at thLa
late day in the session. In view of this
several bills dealing with special
phases in Hawaii have passed one or
the other house. These include bills
to extend the custom and revenue laws
to Hawaii; extending the navigation
laws to Hawaii; and extending to the
Hawaiian Islands the contract labor
laws of the United States. None of
these has become a law as they are de
pendent largely on the future of the
general Hawaiian bill.
What is known as the anti-scalplng
biil has attracted much interest and oc
cupied considerable time in both
branches of Congress. It was the first
piece of general legislation passed by
the House at this session, but its con
sideration in the Senate has been at
tended by numerous delays, it being
displaced recently as unfinished busi
ness in order to take up the army re
organization bill.
Another measure of importance to the
commercial and shipping classes is
known as the shipping bill. It was in
troduced in the Senate by Hanna and
in the House by Payne, and is pending
in both houses. It provides a system
of bounties to American steam and
sailing vessels, dependent upon tonnage
and distance covered, and also makes
merchant vessels an auxiliary foTce to
the navy in time of war. It is on the
calendar of both houses, with itÃ future
in doubt owing to the short time re
maining.
The general legislation of the session
which has advanced to its final stages
and has become law includes the fol
lowing: An act to amend the laws re
lating to American seamen, for the pro
tection 0$ such seamen and to promote
commerce; an act concerning sail
vessels uf over 700 tons; providing for a
national exposition of American prod
ucts and manufactures at Paris; for
the encourugerru-nt of the export trade;
granting extra pay to officers and en
listed men of United States volunteers;
pruvidin? additional Circuit Judges in
the Fifth and Sixth Judicial Circuits;
amending the act governing the imme
diate transportation of dutiable goods
without appraisement; adjusting the
clothing account for deceased soldiers
in certain casts; allowing voting ma
chiiios^ln elections foT Representatives
in Congress, removing the remains of
General J im A. Rawlins to Arlington

paign, siege and defense of Vicksburg
has been passed by both houses. Among
the bills which have passed one or the
other house are: Amending the war
revenue bill as to stamping of bond or
note and mortgage; authorizing the
Secretary of the Navy to pay extra
compensation for certain extra services
in the navy yard, etc.; to establish an
international bank; to pay certain divi
dends of the Freedmans Trust and Sav
ings Bank; giving general right of way
through Indian reservations; amending
the act for the reimbursement of States
for the raising of volunteer forces dur
ing the war with Spain; granting a
pension to ex-Senator John M. Palmer;
authorizing a monument at Havana to
the survivors of the Maine; the revision
of the laws of Alaska, and the judiciary
system also has been considered -in both
.houses, but final action has not yet been
reported.
The total appropriations for the
present session will approximate $700,
--000,000. of which about $250,000,000 will
be for the military and naval uses or
'for subjects connected with the war.
This is a general estimate, however,
based upon totals which may undergo
much change, as very few of the large
appropriation bills have become law,
and some of them have not even been
considered. If the Nicaragua canal bill
is added to the river and harbor bill
this will make a material increase. In
cluded in the naval bill are provisions
for three sea-going battleships, three
armored cruisers and six small cruisers,
for which $10,000,000 is appropriated for
the first year's work.
Based on estimates, the total appro
priations for the Congress (not includ
ing the four appropriation bills left over
by the former Congress) would be ap
proximately $1,600,000,000. of which
amount approximately $600,000,000 is for
war expenses or incident to the army
and navy.
IMPORTANT MATTERS
BEFOKE THE SENATE
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26.â The week
will open with the compromise army
bill still before the Senate, but it is im
possible to say how long it may con
[ tinue to demand the attention of that
body. The best opinion is to the effect
that a vote will be secured Monday,
but that depends largely upon the tem
per of Gorman and his friends, who in
sist upon the amendment of the army
bill so as to further curtail the size
of the army in 1901. It is not, how
ever, believed that they will press their
opposition to the point of entering into
an extended controversy over the mer
its of the measure, and the friends of
the bill count confidently on a vote
before adjournment on Monday.
Gorman disclaims any intention to
force delay, but says he will press his
amendment as long as there is any
chance of success. If the debate should
be continued to any considerable length
the action would be generally accepted
as indicating a purpose to force an ex
tra session, as all admit that with
as many appropriation bills as are
pending it is impracticable to give very
much more time to the army bill and
still pass the supply bills before the 4th
instant. There is yet no danger of fail
ure of either the army bill or the appro
priation bills. No Senator can be found
who avows himself as desirous of forc
ing a called session. Hence the general
belief that all these measures will be
come laws, ar.d when Congress ad
journs for the session next Saturday
legislation will be in such shape as to
render it possible for the legislators to
remain at their homes until next De
cember. There is no doubt of the
passage of the army bill by a large ma
jority when the vote is taken.
The appropriation bills will demand
almost al! the attention of the Senate, i
as the army bill is out of the way. and j
the Senate will have to materially in- !
crease the length of sessions in order
to secure their enactment into laws.
There are still five of these bills which
have not as yet received attention from
the Senate, and five others which are in
conference and which require mofe or
less consideration in conference.
The bills in conference are those pro
viding appropriations for the Indian of
fice, Postoflflce and Agricultural depart
ments and fur the District of Columbia j
and the improvement of rivers and har- j
bors. There are no radical points of |
difference in any of these bills except !
in the river and harbor bill, but there i
are many questions requiring adjust- j
ment, and they will necessarily demand
time for this purpose. The river and
harbor bill carries the Nicaragua canal
provision and other additional appro
priations of large sums of money. Five
bills which have not yet been reported
to the Senate are the sundry civil, the
naval, the army, the fortifications and
the general deficiency. All are import
ant and each will require considerable
time for disposal. Of these five the
Committee on Appropriations has con
sidered only the sundry civil bill's fate.
The Senate will get them all through,
however, unless unexpected opposition
should be developed to some of them.
The calendar is full of bills of a pri
vate and semi-private nature, and also
contains many measures of general
public importance. Many of these are
unobjectionable to all the members of
the Senate, and a majority of those of
this class will pass.
The beginning of the day session will
probably be advanced to 10 or 11 o'clock
each day of the week, and night ses
sions are also counted upon for the
greater part of It.
WILL NICARAGUA BILL
BE PASSED BY HOUSE?
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26.â The House
will devote practically all of the closing
week of the session to the appropriation
bills and conference reports, and the
prospects are that every minute of the
time will be required to get them
through before noon on March 4. An
order has' been made to meet at 11
o'clock each day, but in addition to this
night sessions will be held, and it would
surprise none if one or more all-night
sessions should be necessary. Every
thing else except the appropriation bills
and the army reorganization bill will
go by the board in the final crush. A
few minor bills" may go through by
unanimous consent, but there is no
longer any time for the consideration
of important general measures.
The bill for the government of Hawaii
has been abandoned, and although*rhe
friends of the public building bills fa
vorably acted upon by the committee of
the ten days ago still cherish a
lingering hope that time will be given
for their consideration in tha House, the
chance is so insignificant that it is bare
ly worth more consideration. Hundreds
lof bills will die on the calendar.
! Though the thought of an extra ses
â  sion practically disappeared with the
agreement in the Senate upon the army
'â  reorganitation, it will require the most
I arduous labor to get through the appro
; priation bills and conference reports be
! fore the curtain falls next Saturday.
I The actual physical work of engross
; ing the eight or ten big appropriation
bills during the last forty-eight hours
will necessitate a large temporary addi
i tion to the clerical force. The engross
! ment of bills i: done at the government
i office when no special exigency exists.
but by special resolution, passed Fri
-1 day, permission to engross by hand dur
ing the remainder of the session was
i given. In the rinal adjustment of dlf
j ferences between the two houses, the
House is agreeable tv bring every prop
osition to a vote quickly under a sus
pension of the rules, a motion to sus
pend the rules being in order at any
time during the last week of the session.
This gives the House a distinct advan
tage and enables it at the fag end of
the session to transact an enormous
business In a very short time.
The condition of the appropriation
bills is such that the situation migttt
well cause alarm were it not for the al
most universal desire of both sides of
the House to obviate the necessity for
an extra session of Congress. Only
three of the fourteen supply bills have
gone to the President â the pension,
military academy and diplomatic. Six
have passed both houses. Five of these,
! the legislative, executive and judicial,
the postoffice, the agricultural, District
of Columbia and Indian, are In confer
ence, where the representatives of the
two houses are working to adjust the
differences. The other, the river and
harbor, has been referred to the River
and Harbor Committee of the House.
The sundry civil passed the House and
Is under consideration in the Senate.
i The naval bill has passed the House,
! but has not yet been reported to the
| Senate. The army bill is being consid
i ered In the House, and two of the bills,
I the fortifications and general deficiency,
I are yet to be acted upon by the House.
Moot of the bills in conference have
problems which will be more or less
difficult to solve, but none of these dif
ferences have been so serious as to
make the promise of a deadlock, which
might result in their failure, with the
single exception of the river and harbor
bill, and its loss would not necessitate
an extra session.
The fight over the Nicaragua canal
amendment, which the Senate placed
.over this bill, is very bitter and to the
death. The canal proposition would
command a majority of the votes of
the House, but against it are arrayed
the Appropriations Committee and the
ablest men of the House, who do not
believe that such enormous appropria
tions should be hastily passed during
the dying hours of Congress. Every
strategy known to parliamentary law
will be employed to defeat the proposi
tion, and, if necessary, probably kill the
bill, should the Senate prefer its death
to its enactment without the canal
amendment. After the committee con
siders the Senate amendments Chair
man Burton will come into the House
with a motion for a disagreement on
all amendments and get the Senate's
request for a conference.
Hepburn, chairman of the Interstate
Commerce Committee, will give concur
rence in the canal amendment, which
motion is in order and will take prefer
ence. But as the amendment carries
an appropriation it must be considered
in the committee of the whole first, and
here it is opposed by a bitter fight. The
most obstructive influence will be em
ployed, but it lies In the power of the
majority to win In the end, and it is
probable that upon a vote the House
may agree to the amendment. Eut this
will not clÂ«se the contests by any
means. It can be transferred to all
conference reports upon the bill and
prolonged to the jeopardy of the appro
priation bills to such an extent that tt
would seem that in the final issue
the passage of the canal amendment
would simply be blocked unless it com
manded the necessary two-thirds to
suspend the rules. If this can be done
the bill will probably become a law,
with the canal amendment in it. If it
cannot, the bill will probably fall un
less the Senate at the last moment jet
tisons it. Altogether, the promise is for
an interesting and memorable week in
the House.
SPANISH IMMIGRANTS.
Thirty Arrive at New York En Boute
to the West.
NEW YORK-. Feb. 26.â Thirty Spaniards
arrived on the Cunard liner Umbria. Most
of th^m are laborers and are able to read
and write. All of them are going to dif
ferent mining towns in the West. They
were held for investigation by the immi
grant office to determine whether they
came here to work under contract. The
immigrant authorities say that since the
close of the war with Spain the immigra
tion from that country has increased 100
per cent.

POISONED FOOD AT

TweQty-H ve fluburnites Made
Seriously 111 by Partaking of
ChickeQ-
AUBURN, Feb. 26.â The effect of the chicken dinner given by the
ladies of the Congregational Church of this place on Washington's
birthday has proved to be more serious than was at first anticipated.
Twenty- five persons have been dangerously sick, and every symptom
pointed to poisoning. The authorities have been unable so far to as
certain the cause, but a theory is put forth that the chicken might
have been prepared in a brass kettle. The ladies of the church are
greatly annoyed, and have tried to keep the affair from the public.

RUNAWAY STORE
RACES DOWN RILL
A Two-Story Building's
Mad Flight.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Feb. 26.â Two-story build
ings do not often run away, but that
is what one did in Tacoma this morn
ing. It was an old store building be
ing moved down the steep slope of
Eleventh street to and across Pacific
avenue. It had reached Eleventh and
E streets on rollers. There It was load
ed on big lumber trucks, with four
two-horse teams attached in front. A
big chain brake was rigged up and ar
rangements made to move the structure
down hill early this morning, when the
electric wires could be cut and all the
currents shut off. Just as the start was
made the chain brake broke, and in a
half minute building, horses, wagons
and all had covered two long blocks
down the hill.
Eleventh street their has a grade of
nearly 25 per cent. The frightened
horses galloped at full speed in front
of the big structure, which threatened
at every moment to topple over on
them. Several linemen were out to cut
the electric wires should it be neces
sary. They instantly recognized the
danger of the situation, and cut the
wires just as the building passed by.
Otherwise it would have been thrown
sidewise into the stores along Eleventh
street, besides pulling down many elec
tric light poles.
The runaway building was stopped In
its headlong flight by the fortunate
breaking of a wagon wheel when C
street was reached. This let one corner
of the building down and arrested Its
progress. ,
Thirty electric linemen were working
to-day repairing the wires that were
cut or pulled down.

BUSINESS BRISK AGfllN.
THE blizzard in the East having subsided busi
ness has resumed its normal proportions. This
is shown by the bank clearings, which ex
hibited a gain for the week of 37-7 per cent over
the same week in 1898. Baltimore showed an
increase of 129.5 per cent and New York one
of 4S per cent. Pittsburg, the seat of the iron
industry, made a handsome gain of 88 per cent.
Only three cities of importance recorded a' lossâ San
Francisco. 23.7 per cent; Kansas City, 11. 5 per cent,
and New Orleans, 25.2. The loss in San Francisco
was doubtless due to the prolonged dry weather,
wtiich renders merchants cautious and disinclined to
undertake any new ventures until they see favorable
t:mes ahead.
Supporting the cheerful showing of the bank ex
changes there is the exhibit of failures, which were
191, against 233 for the same week in 1898. So, as
far as these two barometers of trade are concerned,
business is making a fine exhibit.
But there seems to be an incipient lull ahead.
What it will amount to it is impossible to say now.
It may not amount to anything and it may assume
visible proportions. It is a threatened check to our
export trade in consequence of the rise in prices in
some commodities. This is already apparent in the
iron trade, prices of which are up to the parity of
foreign markets, and some of the business which we
have hitherto enjoyed has gone abroad in conse
quence of this. Our domestic demand for iron and
steel, however, is immense and may be sufficient to
keep the market active even with a loss of some for
eign business, but if it should not then a slight shad
ing in quotations would doubtless bring the foreign
demand back again. No anxiety on this score is
shown by the manufacturers, especially as the works
are still crowded with orders reaching months ahead.
In any event, however, the American merchants
will not let the foreign trade slip out of their hands
if they can help it. Already the boot and shoe manu
facturers have taken time by the forelock and are
cutting prices 2% cents to keep the trade. Other lines
may have to follow.
Wall street showed some weakness during the
week and there was a pronounced disposition to raid
the market, but values made no serious break. The
spftness was probably the regularly recurrent reac
tion after a marked advance.
The local situation is quiet. Business is fair and
the merchants are not complaining more than usual,
but it lacks snap. The continued dry weather, while
not thus far alarming, is sufficiently protracted to
render everybody economical and careful about the
future. The situation has got to the gambling point.
If it rains within a few days the State will probably
harvest a very large crop of grain, which means mil
lions to it; but if the rain holds off a fortnight longer
it will come too late for some important districts, and
it is here that the gamble lies. The dry weather hav
ing apparently become chronic nobody has felt like
spending any more money than he can possibly help,
and this makes trade dull all over. We do not need
a great deal of rain to mature the grain crop, but we
r.eed some very soon.
The principal fluctuations of late have been in the
eating line. Meats of all kinds have gone up, and
cured provisions have advanced in sympathy with the
raw goods. To cap the climax the humble codfish
has suddenly become scarce all over the United States
and has gone up in a regular mining-stock way, to
the dismay of housekeepers. Every few days some
eatable or other goes up and it is beginning to cost
something for board.
Real estate feels the effect of the dry weather and
is dull, both in city and country- It is still a good
asset, however, and easily commands loans at the old
rates. Money continues plentiful and collections are
up to the average at this season of the year. There
have been no large failures for some time and the
small ones are not numerous. Local business is
helped along by Government orders for the Philip-
pines and the down-town streets exhibit their usual
activity, so we are in pretty good commercial shape
after all.
Nobody would in any measure weaken the Na
tional Guard, yet there seems to be in connection
with this branch of the public service more soft snaps
than are really necessary.

A BURNING CONTRAST.
\ J HEN Great Britain desires to produce an im
\ â  / pression upon our country in favor of a com-
P*** mercial alliance to protect the "open door"
she is informally represented by a statesman, such as
Lord Charles Beresford. The position of an un
official representative of British diplomacy is far in
ferior to that of a Senator of the United States stand
ing for the restricted sovereignty of California, cov
ering a territorial area that exceeds the area of Great
Britain and Ireland by 73, W square miles, and for a
republic with jurisdiction between the Atlantic and the
Pacific on this continent over more than three million
square miles, or fully twenty-six times the extent,
with double the population, of the British Isles. When
these facts are observed by the 119 members of the
Legislature at Sacramento we invite them to institute
an intellectual and moral contrast between Dan Burns
and Lord Charles Beresford, so that the complete
degradation they are expected by the railroad to at
tach to the State may be fairly brought home to them.
But it is not essential for the legislators to limit
themselves to this startling comparison or to the sense
of humiliation that it must excite in all proud and in
telligent citizens. We have equivalents for Lord
Charles Beresford in California. The Call has al
ready shown the distinction, in qualifications and
character, between Dan Burns and Ulysses S. Grant
and the other candidates among whom more than
thirty votes have been distributed. Suppose the list
be extended so as to include such men as Chief Justice
Beatty, David Starr Jordan, W. W. Morrow and A.
P. Williams, whose names are indiscriminately se
lected, and as to each one of these gentlemen a
comparison be made between him and Dan Burns,
comprising every element, including honorable party
service, that can legitimately enter into a candidacy
for the Federal Senate. What would be the inevitable
result? The Call has asked that one single reason,
apart from monetary contributions, subserviency to
the railroad and association with corrupt municipal
politics, be assigned for the election of Burns, and the
question is met with dead silence. Now let the tests
already indicated be applied, and every voter in the
State will see whether there can be any palliation even
for a deadlock fastened upon the people by such a
man.
The low standard for inferior public officers applied
of late years, especially in a few of the Middle and
Western States, is treated at the East and in Europe
as proof of political degeneracy. When a man,
intellectually and morally deaf and dumb, without a
pretense to the favorable consideration of a great
party, and in a State producing the best type of man
kind, because he is backed by a railroad, can not
only force himself into the prominence of an aspirant
t& leadership in the highest national council, but hold
a Legislature for weeks in an iron grip, the demand
of the people becomes irresistible for complete vindi
cation by the prompt election of a Republican, a
statesman and a gentleman.
BREAKING A MONOPOLY.
JUDGE SEAWELL'S order that a peremptory
writ of mandate issue commanding the Board of
Supervisors to grant to the Mutual Electric
Light Company a permit according the same rights
and privileges as are conferred upon the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Light Company promises to
put an end to an oppressive monopoly and open the
way for a competition that will be of great benefit to
the community.
The decision is the outcome of an action brought
some time ago by the Mutual Electric Company to
annul a contract for lighting the streets which was
awarded to the rival company, the plaintiff alleging
that as the Supervisors granted the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Light Company the privilege of
running overhead wires in certain parts of the city,
while denying the privilege to other companies, the
privileged company enjoyed a virtual immunity from
competition. In that suit the Judge decided some
weeks ago that no legal contract could be awarded
unless the several bidders had equal privileges, and
the mandate issued on Saturday is in accord with the
law thus declared.
The decision is in harmony with the plainest dic
tates of justice. The grant to one company of privi
leges denied to competitors is virtually the establish
ment of a monopoly. In the particular case under
consideration the monopoly has been a heavy burden
upon the municipality and upon the people. It has
been estimated that in the item of public lighting
alone there has been a loss of thousands of dollars
yearly to the municipal treasury by reason of the
special privileges granted to the San Francisco Gas
end Electric Light Company, and of course there has
been a further loss to individuals, who have had to
pay exorbitant rates because competition was shut
out.
As the case stands under Judge Seawell's order if
the San Francisco Gas and Electric Light Company
is permitted to maintain any longer overhead electric
wires in any part of the city the same privilege must
be accorded to the competing company. In other
words the Supervisors have no authority to discrimi
nate in favor of one corporation against another.
This will enable the Mutual Company to compete with
the rival company in all parts of the city, and there
will be cheaper lighting not only for the municipality
but for private parties.
The decision will probably be far reaching in its
results. It puts an end to one of the methods by
which corporations, through the agency of compliant
Supervisors, have been enabled to shut out competi
tors and hold a monopoly in the city. Under the rule
as laid down by Judge Scawell that practice will be
broken up. No special, privileges can be granted
hereafter to favored companies. Public privileges
granted to one must be granted on equal terms to all.
It will be gratifying of course to have all overhead
electric wires removed from our streets. They are a
nuisance and a danger. So long as one lighting com
pany is permitted, however, to erect poles and string
them with wires others must have the same privilege.
No other course is in accordance with justice, reason,
law or expediency.
OUR TRADE WITH GERMANY.
WHILE the pleasant relations long existing be
tween the United States and Germany have*
been subjected to some strain of late by reason
of the antagonism of the German Agrarians to Amer
ican farm products and the hostile attitude taken by
many German newspapers toward the United States
during the war with Spain, it appears the commerce
between the two peoples has gone briskly forward and
increased as if there had been no friction whatever.
A recent publication of the Treasury Bureau of
Statistics shows that our trade with Germany, both
import and export, has been advancing steadily for
tl-e last ten years. A decade ago 10 per cent of our
imports were from Germany, while now over 13 per
cent come from that country, and the export trade
has increased in an even greater degree.
It is within the last year, however, during which the
sentimental friction lias been greatest that the com
mercial expansion has been most notable. From the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27. 1899.
statistics given it appears that in the last half of the
calendar year 1897 our exports to Germany were $32,
--632,122, and in the last half of the calendar year 1808
they were $40,615,770, an increase of nearly 25 per
cent. Our exports to Germany in the last half of the
heavy export year 1897 were $77,132,053. and in the
last half of 1898 they were $85,003,120.
It is to be noted, moreover, that even in meats and
breadstuffs, against which the Agrarians have directed
their strongest efforts, our exports to Germany have
increased. In salted or pickled beef the exportations
increased more than 25 per cent in 1898 over 1897.
Exports of bacon increased 25 per cent, or nearly
10,000,000 pounds; those of hams increased from less
than 5,000,000 pounds to nearly 12,000,000 pounds;
those of pork, fresh and salted, from less than 3,000,
--000 pounds to nearly 13,000,000 pounds; those of lard,
from 205,000,000 pounds to 238,000,000 pounds; while
in fruits and nuts the exports of 1898 were nearly 50
per cent in excess of those of 1896 and but slightly
below those of 1897.
It is evident from these statistics that trade is not
affected by sentimental considerations or by tempo-
rary controversies. The Agrarians may denounce
American meats and fruits, but the masses of the
German people continue to consume them, and the
commerce shown to be so rapidly increasing may
eventually reach proportions hardly inferior to that
we now carry on with Great Britain.
THE POSTOFFICE BUILDING.
CONGRESSMAN KAHN returns from Wash
ington as a bearer of good news. He talks
cheerfully of everything he saw or heard at the
national capital except the blizzards, and being now
safe from them in the sunshine of California his views
of things are bright and optimistic.
He reports the California delegation to be "solid,"
and expresses the belief that with the continuance
of the unanimity of sentiment which now exists we
will be able to obtain for California interests the
recognition they merit from the Government. As
an evidence of what has been accomplished in that
direction he points to the fact that the river and har
bor bill carries with it appropriations for California
of $1,250,000, the largest amount granted for improve
ments in the State for many years.
Mr. Kahn furthermore confirms the report given
out some time ago that the President has planned a
visit to the Pacific Coast during the coming summer
or fall, and will undoubtedly undertake it unless some
emergency now unforeseen and improbable should in
terfere to prevent.
The most interesting report he makes, however, is
that relating to the long-delayed construction of the
Postoffice building. We are told not only that the
work of erecting the edifice will begin speedily, but
that the structure itself will not be the barrack-like
edifice that it looks in the drawings which have been
sent out. On that subject Mr. Kahn is quoted as
saying:
'â¢Before leaving Washington I received most posi
tive assurances from high officials that the construc
tion of the new Postoffice building would soon begin
and be prosecuted with energy from now on. Before
the end of the year the first story of the building will
be up. The appropriation for the building is $500,000,
and the supervising architect of the Treasury says
that, while no radical changes could be made in the
plans which have been heretofore approved, the
wishes of the people of San Francisco would be re
garded as far as possible and such changes made as
Fie compatible with the architectural beauty of the
structure. The architect pledges his professional
reputation that the Federal building now being
erected in San Francisco will be one of the most im
posing structures in America. As provided in the
original specifications nothing but California material
is to be used in the new Postoffice. Granite and marble
will both be used. Some revision has been made in
the specifications, which were about completed whert
I left the capital, and proposals for bids will probably
be advertised within a week. Then as soon as Con
gress adjourns and the half-million appropriation is
available the construction of the building will be pro
ceeded with and continue without cessation until fin
ished."
It is to be hoped the architect who stakes his repu
tation that the building will be one of the most "im
posing" in America did not mean it is to be a case
of imposing on the city, as it looked like at one time.
We have waited so long for the structure that the
people will be glad to see the work begin under any
circumstances, and if it proves to be a really noble
edifice there will be something like a festival among
the citizens when it is completed.
Another batch of sailors have arrived in port with
tales of the suffering they endured during the voyage.
They have made their complaints, and they will ship
the first chance they get, leaving the complaint to take
care of itself. Such is the usual course.
President Zelaya down in Nicaragua does not seem
to like the people of the United States, and while they
do not care much about him one way or another, the
feeling of distaste will become mutual if he gets any
fresher.

A man who tried to commit suicide, but missed His
heart, says that for some time he had been practicing

golden profusion has been in no measure curtailed.
Probably no man was ever yet elected United States
Senator on the threats of his backers to shoot the
opposition if it did not stop opposing.
It is difficult to figure out where the Filipinos ex
pect to reap profit by burning Manila. So far they
have reaped little but hasty burial.
No eulogy delivered over the sort of beef that
killed the soldiers in Cuba can induce the public to
believe it a wholesome article.
Johnson of Indiana may think he is a Republican,
but the basis of his faith is something no man of or
dinary perception can discern.
It might be judged from casualty reports from
Manila that the Filipinos are limited to the use of
blank ammunition.
Doubtless a deadlock is a, nuisance, but there is a
wise precept teaching that of two evils the less should
be chosen.
Bob Burdette is about to marry a rich widow. It is
hard to think of Burdette as serious, but this is no
joke.

can bear. Sometimes a burden is vulgarly known as

As showery weather upon dark brown heath,
Or earliest bird tones springing at a breath,
To meet morn's music, shalt thou go unsung?
No, Dan! T~e chimes that never yet were sung
Are rung for thee in those far realms above,
Where, as 'tis understood, all things are love â
Thine, above all, for everything that swung
In nature's cradle, genial, jovial guest
And host, enjoying earth's life as it went â
To thee, farewell! And may thy soul go on
On easier paths than it did tread upon
In this dim sphere. Thou'rt reckoned with the best
That ever fingers to a pencil bent.

SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 25, 1899.
To the St. Patrick Day Convention of 1899
âGentlemen: On Saturday evening, March
4. the Knights of the Red Branch will
give an entertainment at Metropolitan
Temple in commemoration of the 121 st an
niversary of the birth of Robert Emmet.
The proceeds will be given to the Ninety
eight Centennial and Monument Association
to enable it to make up the amount which
they promise to Bend to Ireland. Gov
ernor Gage will preside on that occasion,
and Mayor Phelan will deliver the ora-
Uiider the circumstances it is desirable
that a full house should greet the cnier
executives of the State and city who come
to co-operate with us in honoring the
memory of Emmet's crowning sacrifice.
Each person should feel a personal interest
and pride in showing, by his presence, that
our devotion to Emmet's memory is not
weakened by time, but is still fresh and
green in the hearts of his countrymen.
We confidently rely on your co-operation
to make this event a success. *Â°ura re
spectfully. Jeremiah Mahoney. Richard C.
O'Connor, Daniel C. Deasy. Committee of
"98 Centennial and Monument Association.
The general admission to the Emmet en
tertainment will be 25 cents, with reserved
seats at 50 cents. Â»Â»_*_._Â«.â¢-
Chairman Broderick of the St. Patrick s
day executive committee reported the
Tivoli had been secured for the afternoon
entertainment. The programme had not
been completed in detail, but. aside from
the oration and poem of the convention,
would consist of an appropriate comedy of
about an hour's duration, with specialties
by the principal members of the Tivoli
stock company. The tickets of admission
will be at the usual prices, 25 cents gen
eral and 50 cents for reserved seats. These
tickets will bear the seal of the Youths
Directory and will be sold at ten different
places in the city.
For the grand evening entertainment at
Mechanics' Pavilion 10.000 tickets will be
printed, bearing the seal of the Youths
Directory, and they will be sold at the Pa
vilion box office and by the members of
the convention. Different organizations
desiring tickets will procure them under
the above ruling of the convention. This
arrangement was agreed upon to guard
against the mixing of the day and even
ing tickets. No reserved seats will be
sold for the Pavilion, 25 cents being the
admission to all part of the auditorium.
The committee on music reported that
Bennett's Band had been engaged for
the evening. It is composed of the same
musicians that were in attendance at the
Irish Fair. The principal piece? of music
so far chosen were "God Save Ireland,"
"Killarney." "Dear Little Shamrock,"
and Professor McKenzie's "My Own Lit
tle Boy," dedicated to the Youths' Direc
tory. The melodies will close with the
"Star Spangled Banner" by the entire
audience. The rehearsals of the grand
chorus of 500 voices are progressing and
by the 17th all will be ready. Professor
McKenzif desires all singers to call upon
him at 524 Eddy street, and to meet for
practice at St. Joseph's Hall, Tenth and
Howard streets, Wednesday evening. The
etereopticon views for the evening will be
unusually interesting.
Lights for Precita Valley.
The Precita Valley Improvement Club
Is gradually accomplishing everything it
has outlined for the betterment of the
district. An assurance was Riven by the
city officials that Bernal Park would be
placed in a "park condition" during the
present fiscal year. Following this the gas
company notified the property owners that
mains would be laid on Folsom street and
Precita avenue immediately. Light would
be available for the houses and streets as
soon as the work was finished. Not to be
outdone in generosity the underwriters
signified their intention of reducing the
rates on all policies within the area
covered by the fire protection. The Bryant
street sewer "ghost" that has been a
source of annoyance to the club and the
residents for a number of years will be
abated by reletting the contract to a man
who will make the connections with the
Army street sewer without further loss
of time.

CALIFORNIA'S
FRUITS AT THE
BIG EXPOSITION
Oscar Polack Gives
Good Advice.
" â â â 
SHOULD EXHIBIT AT PARIS
SAYS SHIPPERS MUST AVOID
FALSE LABELING.
The State's Products Able to Stand on
Their Own Meritsâ Germany
May Be Induced to Re
move Restrictions.
Oscar Polack, a heavy Hamburg Im
porter of California products, is making
his annual visit to this State for the pur
pose of negotiating large purchases of
fruit for shipment to German*. Mr. Po
lack is enthusiastic over the projected dis
play of our products at the Paris Ex
position next year, and is desirous of see
ing them exhibited on an elaborate scale.
He has just returned from v tour of ob
servation throughout the Santa Clara and
San Joaquin Valleys and was at the Pal
ace yesterday. He left on a similar mis
sion to the southern part of the State in
the afternoon. When seen before his de
parture, Mr. Polack Â«aid:
"I hope that the California exhibitors at
the Paris fair will take a lesson from the
Hamburg Exposition of 1897, and see to it
that no partiality be shown to any one
exhibitor. At the latter exposition the
commissioner from this State took it upou
himself to recommend one firm to intend
ing purchasers. This is a manifest in
justice to the other firms who have gouo
to the trouble and expense of exhibiting
their goods. Let the exhibitors co-operata
to make a grand display, and let the merit
of each be an incentive to those who wish
to buy. Let not one firm benefit by the
recommendation of the commissioner, but
let all have an equal chance.
"I would suggest that the commissioner
establish a bureau of information at his
headquarters and that exhibitors, in addi
tion to giving away samples, also dispose
of small packages of the products, which
I am surt will find ready sale, and by
that nuans help to liquidate their ex
penses.
"I believe that a proper display will
have the effect of assuring a brilliant fut
ure for this States products in foreign
marts.
"California growers should also see to it
that when they export their goods there
should be nothing misleading in the labels.
There appears to be a laxity of method in
the labeling, 'prime 1 and 'fancy' being
used indiscriminately, and 'choice' being
applied to fine yellow apricots, for mi
i stance, as well as to the black and poorer
I grade Then, too, they should guard
i against having their cases branded as I
-aw some once in a Hamburg warehouse.
On one end of the case was printed Ital
ian prunes,' while on the other end read
'Fancy California prunes.' They came
from a New York firm and had been put
up by the Vancouver Packing Company
of Vancouver, B. C. I took them to be
Oregon prunes from the thick skin and
large pit but the flavor was good, though
sfilhtly acid. This conflict of labeling
should be stopped, for it tends to shake
confidence in the shipper.
"I think that by concerted action on the
part of California shippers the recent re
striction placed on their fruit by the Ger
man Government could be modified, if not
removed entirely. This decree in regard
to infested fruit is very sweeping and
makes no distinction between the dead
and the live scale. That is why it ope
rates so haVshly against this country
We are well aware that the scale if it
exists, is utterly destroyed by the drying
or dipping process, as in the case of
prunes: But Germany has not provided
for this and consequently the sh pper suf
fers France has adopted similar meas
ures' and Switzerland. I am sorry to see.
prohibits any California fruit entering
fts boundaries. United States Consul
Germain for Switzerland could not pre
vent the passage of the drastic law.
though he made strenuous objections.
"In regard to the late shipment of pears
to Hamburg from this port, which preclp -
tated the exclusion by Germany of fruit
infested with the so-called San Jose scale
I regret to say that it was first discovered
by the authorities in a shipment to me. A
second consignment suffered the same
fate and I hope that the steps taken by
the Regents of the California University
to secure Federal inspection will result
successfully. .
"To avoid unpleasant difficulties the
goods should be properly cured, as the
trip to Europe is 60 long that fermenta
tion is quite likely to occur if they are not
originally in proper condition. I must in
veigh also against the mixing of French
and California prunes. The industry of
this State has nothing to gain by this
questionable practice and will probably
lose in the long run.
"In regard to this year's California crop
I believe it will equal, if not surpass, that
of last season, though I have found the
country pretty dry in my visit throughout
the interior. Still with irrigation, which
has already commenced, a great deal will
be accomplished. This year I anticipate
that Hamburg will require one thousand
carloads of fruit, principally prunes, and
Antwerp and Bremen will each take a
similar amount. Prices will probably
rule as in 1897, though a great deal will
depend on the crop. France has a light
crop of very small prunes this year and
the large California prunes will be in
great demand in foreign markets, and this
fact may have a tendency to elevate
prices."

HOTEL MEN
TO GO AFTER
BUNKO SHARPS
Say the Police Should
Protect Guests.
GAME GETTING TOO FREQUENT
WILL ACT AGAINST THE "SURE
THING"' FRATERNITY.
Major Hooper of the Occidental Says
His Watchmen Had Their Special
Licenses Taken Away by
Department.
â  The three stories published exclusively
In The Call within the past three weeks
regarding the operations of bunko steer
( rs at the Occidental, Palace and Califor
nia hotels have aroused the proprietors to
a sense of the danger to which their guile
less guests are subjected by the machina
tions of the "sure-thing fraternity." They
claim, with just reason, that they are en
â¢ titled to the protection which the law
affords the tax-paying citizen and that
â the protection is not forthcoming. They
â¢ say that Individual cases are reported to
. the police, but nothing is done with the
. swindlers.
' On the other hand the police claim that
It is utterly impossible to convict the con
.. fidenoe men unless the victim remains to
y against them. In the majority oi.
i he latter is a traveling man, and is
t bilged to go away on business or for rea
sons of policy. The most that can be
: - done, according to the police, is to im
â¢ prison the bunko men on charges of va
grancy or order them to leave town. This
they say is done every day.
Major Wiliam B. Hooper of the Occi
â â¢â¢ dental Hotel expressed himself in no un
â  â¢ certain terms regarding the proposition.
â¢â¢I claim," said he, "that the traveling
â¢ public is entitled to the protection of the
police against these designing individuals
who prey on it. There was a time when
I was in a position to take care of them
myself. That was when my day and night
watchmen had special police licenses. The
â¢ department took them away on some pre
text or other and left me comparatively
helpless in case of a disturbance or the
operations of the bunko steerers. uhy
does not the officer on the beat take a
. look in my hotel now and then? He prob
ably knows some of the men and could
use his authority as in such cases made
and provided. I think the hotel men
should combine and take measures to free
their houses from the obnoxious class of
General R. H. Warfleld of the California
would not say that the police had been re
miss in their duty regarding the bunko
men. "I think," said he, "that the police
: are doing their duty In the matter. In
the case of the guest of this hotel who
was bled for $250 the sergeant on this beat
came around and appeared to know the
guilty men, and I thought from the way
he spoke he would have them in custody.
Whether he has or not 1 do not know. 1
think that the police should aid the hotel
croprietors in protecting their guests from
euch happenings. We take all the precau
tions in the world to avoid them, but they
will happen. We have informed guests
of the dangerous character of these men,
but have been told to mind our own af
fairs and the men who have been warned
' deliberately went with the bunko steerers
and parted with more or les3 money. I
believe that summary action should be
taken with the undesirable class, and ff
they cannot be convicted they should be
ordered to leave, town within twenty-four
hours."

"THE WOMAN PREACHEB."
A Sermon by Staff Captain Dunham
of the Salvation Army.
Staff Captain Mrs. Dunham, training
mother of the Home Cadets of the Salva
tion Army, led the meeting yesterday at
the headquarters, 1135 Market street. Mrs.
Dunham, who is an eloquent and pleas
ing speaker, was recently transferred
from Los Angeles to this post. Her work
principally has been in the training of
young Salvationists, and many of the
youthful corps officers of the organization
have been fitted for their future labors
under her careful instruction.
Captain Dunham's subject yesterday
was "Woman's Right to Preach." She j
took for her text Christ's command to
Mary to go down into the city of Jeru
salem and declare his resurrection. From
this, if from no other divine authority,
woman may know that she has a speak
ing part in the great plan of human salva
tion. She has been given "a ready, swift
and tuneful tongue." to be used to tell
the story of the redemption. Mary told
that the Savior had arisen and that
woman's voice has rang down the centur- !
les the herald of Christianity. Paul said:
"Let the woman keep silent that the law
of man, not the law of God, might be
kept." This was an ordinance of an old
dispensation to pass away before the
coming of the new that was ushered in
with Christ. This was the dawn of
woman's suffrage, and from the rostrum
of the church she has preached the word j
side by side with her brother preacher. |
Her right to preach was the first author- I
ity given by Christ after he arose from
the dead.

Connecticut Mutual's Fifty-third Re- !
port.
There is never a dry word in the annual j
reports of the president of the Connect!- j
cut Mutual Life Insurance Company; the i
fifty-third report, made public to-day, is j
filled, from opening line to signature, with j
the most trenchant analysis of the false ]
methods of insurance followed up by the |
so-called great corporations which labor j
for big showings without regard to the ]
interest of the policy-holders. The Con- |
necticut Mutual is founded upon the most \
conservative and strictly fair business i
principles, its object being to protect j
Its policy-holders' interests by affording
them the cheapest, safest insurance in I
the world. How completely this is done
the annual report shows convincingly. In |
fifty-three years the company has re- !
ceived nearly $2113,000,000; has returned to j
policy-holders or their beneficiaries over
$195,000,000, and shows total assets on Jan
uary 1 last of upward of $64,000,- ]
less than that of any other company; its i
dividends to its members higher, and its j
insurance therefore less whole and mdi- i
vidually than in any other company. These |
are the essential points which appeal to
the insuring community; when they see,
conclusively, how completely the Con
necticut Mutual meets these require
ments, they at once give it their largest
measure of confidence.

Rabbi Voorsanger Lectures at the i
Congregational Church.
Rev. Jacob Voorsanger delivered a lee- |
ture at the Fourth Congregation Church !
last evening on the subject "The Es- |
sentials of Religion." This was the third '
of a series of six lectures on the subject I
to be given by thinkers of the city who !
view religion from different philosophi
cal, theological and ecclesiastical stand
points. The lecture next Sunday evening
will be by G. W. Dickie, manager of the
Union Iron Works.
Rabbi Voorsanger compared religion to
a structure. The first essential he said
was a solid foundation and that of re
ligion was the recognition and acknowl
edgment of an Almighty God. The super
structure of a religion should be pleas-
Ing and should have nothing about it
which would prevent those or other re
ligions from entering it. The word wel
come should be over the door and all
should be made to realize that the struc
j ture was the home of the children of
I God. Three pillars which should support j
! the structure and be essential to its exis- i
I tence are: Law, worship of God and lov- j
1 ing kindness.

NEW MARINE WAYS FOR THE SHIPWRIGHTS' UNION
â  * FTER years of fighting between the Shipwrights' Association and the firm of Hay & Wright over â 
A the employment of union men the association has decided to carry the war into Egypt. It has se
% A cured a site in the India basin and will build marine ways, like the above, thereon, and will enter 3
$ into competition with Hay & Wright. |
SHIPWRIGHTS
WILL BUILD
MARINE WAYS
A Long Fight Settled
in That Way.
GOOD SITE IN INDIA BASIN
WORK OF CONSTRUCTION TO BE
BEGUN AT ONCE.
The British Ship Talus and the Bark
Ceylon Meet in CollisionâSail
ing of the TTansport
Roanoke.
Another set of marine ways are to be
built in San Francisco Bay. They are to
be located in the Indian Basin, will ac
commodate vessels of from 1600 to 1800
tous burden and will be owned by the
Shipwrights' Association of this port. The
site for the ways has already been se
cured the plans and specifications pre
pared' and the work of building will begin
this week.
Behind this venture there is quite a
story. The Shipwrights' Association and
the ship-building firm of Hay & Wright
have been at outs for many years. The
members of the association assert that
the firm will persist in employing "scab"
labor at reduced wagea and are thus do
ing the shipwrights a great injustice.
Delegations from the union have called
upon Alexander Hay from time to time,
but no satisfactory conclusion could ever
be reached. Then the shipwrights got up
an address to the shipowners, which was
largely circulated along the front. The
owners were in sympathy with the union
and all declared that they were willing to
pay union wages and have the work done
in a union yard by union men, but that
Hay & Wright had the marine ways and
the facilities and therefore they were ob
liged to patronize them.
This brought the Shipwrights' Associa
tion to a full realization of the situation.
It was plain to the members that if they
wanted to earn a living and keep up union
wages they would have to build marine
ways and enter into competition with Hay
& Wright. A meeting was held and 100
members agreed to subscribe $500 each tor
the purpose named and a committee was
appointed to see what could be done in
the circumstances. The committee was
composed of Thomas McConnell, J. How
son, A. Alexander, R. Camuffo. Denis
Flynn and James McKibben. McConnell
is president of the association, Howson
has Just completed the four-masted
schooner A. J. West at Grays Harbor, and
Alexander is an expert on marine ways.
The tirst thing the committee did was
to write to Moran Bros, of Seattle, as it
was rumored that that firm wanted to sell
its marine ways as it was about to build
a floating dock. A reply was received
stating that the marine ways were not
for sale as Moran Bros, are going to ope
rate both floating dock and ways.
It was then the shipwrights decided to
build for themselves. A frontage on the
water front extending 400 feet along India
street from H street in South San Fran
cisco was secured. The' lots are 150 feet
deep and back of them the union has se
cured six more lots on Seventh avenue,
between H and G streets. On these ways
designed by A. Alexander will be built
and machinery put in, after which the
shipwrights will be ready for business.
"Our plans are now all completed and
work will begin at once," said President
McConnell yesterday. "We had a most
enthusiastic meeting to-day (Sunday) at
which nearly every member was present
and it was decided to push right ahead
with the work. The ways will be located
just midway between the sugar refinery
and Hunter's Point drydock, where we
will have a depth of 20 feet of water at
any stage of the tide. We will handle all
descriptions of vessels and will be able to
take up anything that comes along except
a heavy iron ship or big steamer. '
"We are not going to run the ways to
drive the bosses out of business. Any
boss employing union men can have the
use of the ways at a slight advance on
the cost of maintaining them. We do not
seek to make them a money-making con
cern, but the men puttinp their cash into
them will be satisfied with a very small
return. In a few months we will be able
to go before the ship-owners of the port
and say. 'Gentlemen, the last time we
called upon you you expressed yourselves
as being in favor of union men and union
wages, but as we had no marine ways you
were compelled to use a yard employing
scab labor. We have now gone to the ex
pense of erecting the best set of marine
ways in the Pacific and hope you will
patronize them.' I think we will get their
work and uphold union principles at the
same time."
The bark Ceylon, from Honolulu, and
the British ship Talus, from Cardiff, were
in collision inside the heads yesterday
morning. The captains of the vessels tell
conflicting stories, each claiming that the
other ran him down. Both vessels were
sailing in, and after passing through the
heads the wind fell light and the Talus
came to anchor. The captain of the Cey
lon says the accident happened before the
Talus dropped her anchor, but Captain
Stenhouse says his ship was swinging to
her anchor when the Ceylon ran into him.
"While drifting in between the heads,"
said Captain Miller of the Ceylon, "we
were in collision with the British ship
Talus. There was no wind and the Talus
was also drifting. Her stem struck the
Ceylon between the fore and main rig
ging on the starboard side and carried
away forty feet of our bulworks besides a
number of stanchions and a big piece of
our rail."
"When off the heads at 9:20 a. m.," said
Captain Stenhouse, "the wind fell light,
so we let go the starboard anchor in
thirty-five fathoms of water and paid out
fifty fathoms of chain. After we had
swung to the flood tide the bark Ceylon
drifted in and collided with the Talus.
The bark struck the ship on the star
board quarter, and while no damage ap
parently was done to the Talus, the Cey
lon had her bulwarks stove in and part
of her rail carried away."
The British ship Riversdale arrived
from Hamburg yesterday. On January
2 last Captain Griffiths spoke the British
ship Dimsdale, from Astoria for Queens
town, with her foretopgallant mast gone.
The transport Roanoke sailed for Ma
nila yesterday with a full cargo of sup
plies for the troops. She took away sev
enteen recruits for the .Fourteenth Infan
try eleven men of the Twentieth Infan
try and two men and fifty-seven recruits
for the Twenty-third Infantry. The men
and recruits are in charge of Second
lieutenant Robert M. Bromblla. Lieu
tenant Colonel MUey, Dr. Fraser and
Acting Assistant Hospital Surgeon Cleav
er also went away on the transport.
The tug Relief went out with the Roa
noke, taking a party of friends of the
officers of the transport along. This is
the first run the tug has made since her
new boilers were put In and she easily
held her own with the steamer as far as
U is^said that the battleship lowa will
go up to Mare Island next Wednesday.
She will remain at the navy-yard for
some time and will receive a thorough

driven to make a secure foundation and
nearly all the timbers used in the bunk
ers themselves are 14x14. The scales,
buckets, hoisting machinery and engines
are all being made in San Francisco and
when completed the bunkers w;il I be the

FREE LIBRARY BRANCH
IN WESTERN ADDITION
BOARD OF TRUSTEES WILL SOON
ESTABLISH ONE.
It Will Fill a Long-Felt Want in
That Sectionâ To Be Opened
in May.
The trustees of the Free Public Li
brary are about to establish a branch of
that institution in the Western Addition,
which will till a long felt want of book
readers in that section of the city. Here
tofore library patrons who reside in that
locality were obliged to go to the City
Hall for their books, but in a little while
the distance will be materially shortened
and books will, as it were, be brought
to their very doors.
In their last appropriation by the Board
of Supervisors a sum of money was in
cluded by the trustees for the establish
ment of this branch, which will now be
the sixth in operation here. Those in the
Mission, <> Richmond district, Potrero,
South of Market and North Beach have
been successfully conducted for years.
In the order for the new branch the
trustees specified that it should be lo
cated In the district bounded by Sutter,
Jackson Webster and Scott streets, and
Secretary George Mullin is in consulta
tion with property-owners on Fillmore
street, near California, for a suitable site.
He considers that to be the most desirable
location on account of its central char
acter He has two stores in contempla
tion, which appear to have all the re
quirements for the proposed branch.
"It will cost nearly $3000," aaid Secretary
Mullin, "to properly equip the new
branch library, but the reading-loving
public of the Western Addition
are entitled to the expenditure of
the money and will no doubt appreciate
the improvement. We will have between
two thousand and three thousand volumes
on the shelves, and by leaving an order the
patron will be enabled as at present to
get any desired book the next day. An
express wagon will leave the main library
every day with a load of books which
have been so ordered.
"The board has for a long time realized
the necessity of a branch in the Western
Addition, but lack of funds has compelled
it to postpone its establishment. Now
that we have the necessary funds we will
go right ahead with the work.
"The business men will welcome the
branch library, as it means increased
traffic and consequently more sales."
THE CHURCH AND DIVOHCE.
Bishop Mcreland on the Dissolution
of the Marriage Tie.
"The Church's Discipline Concerning
Marriage and Divorce" was the theme
treated yesterday morning at St. Luke's
Episcopal Church by Bishop William H.
Moreland. He said that marriage was an
Indissoluble bond, uniting husband and
wife, even as Christ and his church are
united in the incarnation. He quoted
freely from the Old and New Testaments
to show the teaci ng of God's Word, and
repeated the strong and emphatic words
of Christ declaring that the man or wo
man who divorced the other partner and
married again was ruilty of adultery. He
said the Holy Catholic church from the
beginning had held up before men the
true standing of the married life, and in
all its divisions â Oriental, Roman and
Anglo-Saxonâ was strict in its discipline,
which was based upon the explicit teach
ings of Christ himself. The only exception
was the innocent party in a divorce for
the cause of adultery.

Schools.
The sacrament of confirmation was ad
ministered with solemn and impressive
ceremony yesterday afternoon at St.
James Church by Archbishop Riordan.
Over 225 children and adults knelt before
the altar to be anointed with the sacred
chrism and receive one of the most im

church.
The ceremony commenced promptly at
4 o'clock and was conducted by the Arch
bishop in person. Immediately after the
singing of the preliminary hymns usual
to occasions of this character, the sacra
ment was administered. The sponsors for
those confirmed were Eugene P. Murphy
and Miss Elizabeth Foote. The master of
ceremonies to the Archbishop was the
Rev. Father Lynch. At the conclusion of
the ceremony a short address appropriate
to the occasion was delivered by Arch
bishop Riordan. In it he endeavored to
impress upon the children the necessity of
a strict observance of the tenets and
teachings of their church. lie likened
their period of life to the springtime when
every good or evil influence can either be
accepted or rejected. Their characters
are in that stage of formation, he claimed,
where every outward influence is liable to
make a lasting and an indelible impres
sion, either for good or evil. For the many
temptations that are thrown in the path
way of youth to swerve it from a right
eous course the only safeguard, the
preacher maintained, was a strict adher
ence to and a constant practice of re
ligion. Parents were reminded of the ne
cessity of sending their children to the
parochial school of St. James Parish in
order to equip them with a good educa
tion in the principles of their religion that
in after life will serve them as a guide
for their own salvation and a means of
defending their faith ' against whatever
oppression it is tendered.
After explaining fully the meaning and
the necessity of the administration of the
sacrament of confirmation as a means to
salvation the address was concluded with
â¢ in appeal to parents to send their chil
dren to the parish school, where they can
receive a tho r ough education in the prin
ciples and doctrines of their religion.
Immediately after the address solemn
benediction was celebrated by the Arch
bishop, assisted by the clergy of St.
James Church.
At the conclusion of the benediction the
services were brought to a close with the
administration of a pledge of total absti
nence to the entire class of boys.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
Sick Women Advised to Seek
Advice of Mrs. Pinkham.
[LETTER TO MRS. PINKHAM NO. 94,863]
"I had inflammation and falling
of the womb, and inflammation of
ovaries, and was in great pain. I took
medicine prescribed by a physician,
but it did me no good. At last I heard â
of Lydia E. Pinkham'a Vegetable Com-
pound, and after using it faithfully. I
am thankful to say I am a well women.
I would advise all suffering women to
seek advice of Mrs. Pinkham." â Mrs.
G. H. Chappell, Grant Park, 111.
For several years my health was
miserable. I suffered the most dread-
ful pains, and was almost on the verge
of insanity. I consulted one of the
best physicians in New York, and he
pronounced my disease a fibroid tumor,
advising an operation without delay, '
saying that it was my only chance for
life. Other doctors prescribed strong
and violent medicine, and one said I
was incurable, another told me my
only salvation was galvanic batteries,
which I tried, but nothing relieved me.
One day a friend called and begged me
to try Lydia E. â¢ Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound. I began its use and took
several bottles. From the very first
bottle there was a wonderful change
for the better. The tumor has disap-
peared entirely and my old spirits have
returned. I heartily recommend your
medicine to all suffering women." â

LANDS THE OPEN STAKE FRO*
SPEEDY RIVALS.
J. H. Rosseter's For Freedom Again
Proves Invincible at Union Cours
ing Park, Winning the
Grace Cup.
Despite a star attraction at a rival park,
Ingleslde Coursing Park was filled to
overflowing yesterday. Betting was ex
tremely brisk during the afternoon, and
the men in the pool boxes were kept busy
in their efforts to satisfy the moneyed
contingent, i'wo stakes furnished numer
ous opportunities to wager, and both the
"talent" and the "short-enders" enjoyed
good fortune.
Handy & Smith's Victor Queen won the
open stake and J. Higgins* Sarah Curran
took the sapling event. The winner of the
old-dog slake was a 20 to 5 favorite over
Maud S, the runner-up, owing to the fact
that Curtis' bitch had experienced a
grueling course with Luxor in a bye in
the semi-final round. Victor Queen gain
ed a quick victory over Maud S. landing
a flag by a score of 5 to 3. Sarah Curran
and Cash Day met in the final owing to
the absence of Mamie Pleasant, who was
withdrawn on account of her hard course
earlier in the day. Both bitches were
slipped to a lively "jack," which led them
all over the field for a minute and twenty
three seconds. Lash Day had the better
of the course at the start, but her rival
showed the foot and scored 15 to Cash
Day's 8 points.
Lottie M's chances in the open stake
were ruined by her hard course with De
pend On Me. She beat the latter by a
score of 13 to 7 in a minute and thirty
eight seconds' running. The hare proved
a wonder and led the contestants up and
down the field four times. When the kiii
was made every one felt easier, as it was
thought the bitch would run herself to
death. In the first round Long-shot Con
ley put out Luxor owing to her favoring
the former. The running of Tea Rose
was noticeable. She is no more than a
. puppy, yet she put out some speedy rivals
before succumbing to Mountain Beauty
in the longest course of the day, the time
of which was 2:45. Tea Rose proved her
self possessed of speed and stamina, and
with age should prove a stake-winner.
Lawrence, . another of Deckelman's
speedy string, showed up well during the
running. His long course with Nellie B
â¢was one of the prettiest seen at the park
in some time. He won by a score of 12
to 0. Before Nellie _> got sighted Law
rence scored 18 points, which were not
counted. After that he scored twelve
more without giving the bitch a chance
to score once. The swift pace and lengthy
course told on him, for when he went up
against Fear Not in the next round he was
put out.
â¢ Among the short ends to land yesterday
. were: Sarah Curran beat Lexington at
1 to 2; Eclipse beat Twin City Girl at 4
to 5; Long-shot Conley beat Luxor at 3

Olympic Club Holds
Another Shoot
THE SPEEDIEST BIRD YET
FAY MAKES A BRILLIANT CEN-
If-tt, bHOT.
The California "Wing Shooting Club
"Will Hold Its Annual Gold Medal
Contest Next Sunday
at Ingle&ide.
Many dollars changed hands at the
Olympic Gun Club shoot yesterday, but
â  next Sunday is the day wfcen tne hopes
I and money of the unsteady will go
I a-glimmerlng. The California Wing-Shoot
! ing Club, the oldest organization of Its
; kind in America, will hold its annual
medal contest next Sunday, and this
shoot promises to be the everit of the
season. Such men as Ned Fay and Dr.
) ''Slade," who have contested side by side
for a quarter of a century, and many
others equally as expert, will bring down
the winged targets. Three gold medals
and Btacks of double eagles will be con
tested for, together with the champion
ship of this champion club.
No gold medals were hung up yesterday
to spur tne contestants to greater ef
fortÃ. The shooting waa for $10 a corner
and resulted in some good scores and
more sport. The first match was one of
twenty-five birds. J. S. Fanning, Clar
ence Nauman. Dr. "Blade.," M. K. Kittle
man, Ed Galnes and Charles Stone en
tered. Fanning, the Olympic Club crack,
i was the first to face the trap. One after
another his first half dozen birds fell
I under his shots, but later he was handed
out a few either tricky or impregnable
| birds and four escaped him, giving him
I but 21. Nauman, the second up, snot un
'. usually well, bringing down 23 birds. Dr
Slade tied Fanning with 21, while Kittle
: man, Galnes' only recognized rival for
l last place, secured 8. Games plucked 13
of his 25 and carried off Kittleman's
money, but it 1b thought that some one
else carried off thai, of both. Stone, the
last to face the trap in the process of
rotation, killed 12, but dfil not let the
poor score crush him.
The next match was one of six birds,
and during its progress the fastest bird
that ever left a trap was uncovered for
Fay. Fay's first barrel practically
plucked it, but like a shot it whirled for
the line and a second shot dropped It
dangerously near the boundary flag. Fay
fot his 6, killing clean. Nauman also
ropped 6, as did Kittleman, amid the
plauditÃ of the assembled enthusiasts.
"Slade" scored 3 out of his half dozen;
Ed Games, 3; Charles Grant, 4; Mans
field, 3; Charles Reames, 5, and Burrell,
3. At this point some seventeen dozen
! pigeons had been slain or freed, and the
i game ran short, which practically ended
j ihe day's sport. Preparations for Sun
day's big event are nearly completed and
' the â¢'cracks" are preparing to battle for
the golden trophies.
SHOT THROUGH THE FOOT.
L. Brunn, While Firing at Rats, Near
ly Killed Himself.
L. Brunn, 22% Decatur street, has been
greatly annoyed by rats, and yesterday
morning he borrowed a .22 caliber rifle
and determined to exterminate tht-m. Ho
succeeded in killing one and when another
appeared he became ho excited that he
pulled the trigger too soon and the bullet
struck uiÃ right foot.
Brunn had enough of shooting, and he
was taken to the Receiving Hospital in
the patrol wagon. Dr. Maher found that
the bullet had passed through his foot and
lodged in the sole of his shoe. Fortun 'te
ly the bullet r.iissed the bones and he
escaped being maimed for life.
CoroYiium, known hypothetically as a
constituent of the sun, has been dis

lighter than hydrogen.

Earl D. Stevens of Buffalo, N. ?., won !
the twenty-four hour bicycle race which
was started in Mechanics' Pavilion Satur
day night and ended last night by a mar
gin of several lengths over his nearest
competitor, Charles Turville of Phila
delphia.
The finish was mildly exciting. Of the â¢
sixteen men who entered the event, but
five were left at the twenty-third hour.
They were Stevens, Turville, Lawson,
Pierce and Waller, all of whom were
close together, Stevens and Turville
being only one lap ahead of Lawson, who
was two laps ahead of Pierce and V. aner.
It being apparent to Lawson, Pierce and
Waller that they could not hope to regain
their lost ground, as the leaders were
fully as trtsh and as swift as they were,
they agreed to drop out five minutes be
fore the finish and leave Stevens and
Turville to fight it out between them.
This was done, but neither Stevens nor
Turville was willing to assume the pace,
so they rode side by side up to the last
two laps, when Stevens suddenly Jumped
ahead and by a lively sprint managed to
land himself a winner by half a- dozen
lengths The crowd cheered the victor as
he was taken off his wheel and carried to
his dressing room.
Steven* and Turville both covered an
enual distance in the twenty-four hours,
4M) miles 6 laps. The record is 464 miles,
made by Pierce last December in New-
York Stevens never left his wheel dur
ing the long ride. Turville, Chapman and
Fredericks had a collison early in the day
and all throe fell, but quickly remounted,
and as it was an accident, the referee al
towed them the lap they lost. Pierces
pedal also came off and it threw him and
waller. They lost two laps, which wer<;
a!s<> allowed them. But when poor Johnny
Lawson punctured his tire on a nail stick
ing up in the track and lost a lap while
exchanging wheels, the referee would not
allow it. and this one lap probably lost
Laweon thf race. Mr. Loos' action in
this reepeot was condemned.
Of the other starters who began the raco
Saturady night Miller, the cham
pion six-day rider; Aronson, Hale, Leon
art, P'lkington and Ban.aby quit in tho
early stages of the race, being unable to
keep up the heavy pace.
"Kid" McCoy duplicated his success of
Saturday evening in another bag-pifnching
exhibition, which was warmly applauded.
McCoy can hit the bag faster with his
elbows and shoulders than many athletes
can with their fists, and his exhibition was
quite novel in this respect.
Last night's programme closed the pres
ent season of Indoor racing. The men
may go to San Jose the end of this week,
and after that to Fresno and Los Angeles,
after which they will go East for the I
opening of the racing season in April.

THE FEBRUARY
SCHOOL BILLS
What Willthe Monthly
Saving Be?
CANNOT PAY JANUARY BILLS
NO jiiORE CUTS IN THE FORCE OF
TEACHERS.
The Rehearsing of the Kilpatrick
Case Considered Only a Useless
Threshing Over of Old
Straw.
In a few days the Board of Education
â¢will be wrestling with the financial prob
lem of the February bills. Those of Janu
ary. Jess 20 per cent, footed up a total of
584.000, and with the holdback the expendi
ture of the month was $105,wa). or, in
round numbers. $4000 in excess of the one
twelfth allowance. The teachers' salaries
alone were 172,000, and may be dropped
$5000 for February. The $4000 for the jani
tors will probably stand at the same fig
ure, as little changes were made in these
employes. The rents. $700, and office and
shop. $1200, will not take much of a fall,
but the labor and bills, $6000 for January,
may decrease about one-half for Febru
ary, making a saving of $8000 or possibly
$10,000 over last month. This will lower
the $106,000 of January to $95,000, leaving a
surplus of $6000 out of the monthly $lUI,
--000 allowance
No attempt will be made to settle the 20
per cent holdover, amounting to $21,000.
with February money, though a small
payment may be made with a view of
lowering this deficit. Consequently the
teachers must be content with monthly
installments till all of January is paid.
The retrial of the KilpatricK case is
considered oy some of the directors of the
present board as being about the most
useless threshing over of old straw that
couLd be imagined. In the former trial
Ki'.patrick, with a board that was thirst
ing for his gore, beat the game with both
hands down. What will he not do now.
with a body of Directors in office that are
disposed to treat him with something
like justice? Said a Director yesterday:
"The best thing we can do is to drop the
Kilpatrick matter as quickly as we can.
It is one of the inheritances from our pre
decessors."
There will probably be no more cuts in
the teacher force of the School Depart
ment, as the board members eel that any
more action along that line would cripple
the schools. Although six new vice prm
cipalshipÃ were created at the last meet
ing, the positions will not be filled until
the finances of the department permit the
outlay.

Large damage suits as a result

January 31. at Second avenue station. It

the other will suffer from his in.v: lea for

Mr. Parr, who is a mining man, states
that his injuries have prevented him com

would have netted him at least $50,000. His

MLLE. PIANKA SWOONS
AMONG FIERCE LIONS
MLLE. PIANKA. "the Lady of Lions," as the show bills read, passed \*
through a hair-curling adventure yesterday afternoon when she was 3
displaying her lion-taming abilities before the usual Sunday crowd . at 85
the Chutes. She had just finished the first part of her * performance Â«
and was making her quick change in the darkened cage when she fainted and 82
fell prostrate in the corner within easy reach of her crouching and glowering
leonine pets. #
The attendants did not know that she had fainted until they heard the gj
fall of her body on the floor of the cage. Her husband then grasped the #
long Iron pole with which the lions are driven out of the big cage into their 38
separate boxes and forced them away from the "Mile. Pianka," who was 0
lying near the gate through which she gains an entrance to the cage. The 88
curtain was dropped before the spectators realized that an accident had &
taken place and the lights were instantly turned on. Unlocking the gate, 28
pulling it open and drawing the body of Pianka out was the work of an in- Â«
stant, but it was none too soon, for the favorite pet of all, Spitfire, was mov- S3
ing toward the prostrate body. Pianka was dragged out of the cage and the Â»
door closed just in time. .' ,:> 88
The feminine tamer of wild beasts has been suffering of late from an W
abscess in the right ear. It was specially painful yesterday, causing violent *5
headaches and nervous excitement. It is to this that Pianka assigns the 8
cause of her swooning in the cage. An hour after the accident she was herself g
again and expressed a willingness to go on for the regular performance of the Â§|
evening. S

A SUNDAY LAW NECESSARY.
The Rev. Charles Edward Locke on
the Tendencieb of the Times.
At the Central Methodist Episcopal
Church last evening Dr. Charles Edward
Locke, the pastor, delivered a sermon on
the subject, "Why the State of California
Should Have a Sunday Law." The text
was Isaiah lviii:l3-14, "If thou ahalt call
tbe Sabbath a delight, the holy of the ,
Lord, honorable; I will cause thee to ride <
upon the high places of the earth." Dr. !
Locke said in part: .-,_.,
"The Sabbath is a memorial of God s
fatherly care of his children. The need of
the Sabbath inheres in man's physical
necessities. A noted physician says: 'Men
no longer die, they kill themselves.' The
body must have an abundance of regular i
rest. No man will die from overwork '
who rests absolutely one uay in seven.
"The Sunday is indispensable as a nome j
day. It is the only day of the week in j
which the busy father can get acquainted
With his famiiy. Yonder glistening me- j
mortal leaning against the eastern sky j
is not so much a monument to the Father
of His Country as It is a testimonial to <
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JfH-ISKUAKr 27, 1899.
the Christian home, as it recalls "Wash
ington's own words, 'All I am I owe to
my mother.' The home is the palladium
of the republic: the Sabbath is necessary
to the home.
"The Sabbath is necossary as a day of
worship. Worship inculcates reverence.
Monarchies may exist by force, but re
publics can live only by virtue. Worship
establishes a standard of morals. And as
a worship day Sunday is the great oppor
tunity for religious enterprises. Ten mil
lions of children are trained by I.OOO.tXK)
devoted teachers in the principles of true
character. It is the day for deeds of
mercy and philanthropy in hospitals,
prisons and the slums. There ought to be
a Sunday law setting the day aside as a
rest day, a worship day. because this is a
Christian nationâ so recognized in the
common law of the land.
"This State should enact^and enforce a
Sunday law, because Sabuath breaking
leads "to anarchy, unbelief and im
morality. Places of blackest vice thrive
on the Sunday because the victims are on
the streets on the Sunday.* In defense of
the weaker elements of society a Sunday
iaw ought to close places of vice. With
out a Sunday law labor is being gradually
enslaved. Labor organizations snould
earnestly demand a Sunday law and a re
duction of Sunday labor in self-defense.
Avarice and greed are requiring seven
days' labor for six days' pay. As a pleas
ure day the Sunday is already a slumber
ing volcano."
A NICE FAMILY ROW.
Efforts of a Drunken Man to Clean
Out His Batch of Relatives.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 2G.â A wedding and a
free family fight among the brothers of
the bride took place at the Perry resi
dence to-night. Miss Louise Perry was
married to Manuel Mentel. on Valdez
street, North Alameda, by the Rev.
Father Gloria early in the evening. About
10 o'clock Manuel Perry, one of her
brothers, came hÂ»me fighting drunk and
proceeded to clean out the house, begin
ning with his father and mother, and
t;iding with the newly married sifter, tak
ing a fall or two out of the bridegroom
on the way.
The drunken man was finally laid out
A'lth a blow on the head with an ivory
club in the hand of another brother
named Julian. Manuel was taken to the
Receiving- Hospital with a badly cracked
scalp and muttering in his delirium that
he would kill the whole family, and Ju
llan was arÂ«ested by Deputy Sheriff Quin
lan and Special Officer Stewart, charged
with an assault with a deadly weapon.

LIFE INSURANCE.

ANNUAL REPORT
OF THE
CONNECTICUT
MUTUAL
LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
To the Members:-^
In connection with the following com- i
! ments upon our business in 1898, we ask j
your careful reading of the Financial ;
! Statement which is printed in another col- j
umn, the items of which are. therefore, >
not repeated here.
It is very gratifying to be able to say j
1 that, notwithstanding the many untoward j
conditions of the past year, its main re- j
sults, so far as the Connecticut Mutual j
' Is concerned, have been satisfactory, j The ;
mortality has been favorable; the lapses
and surrenders were relatively few; the j
amount of business In force and the pre- j
mium Income have Increased; the assets
' have Increased, by $598,345 46, and the sur-j
' plus by $160,225 23; the company's own
' unique standard of economy has been;
i maintained; it has made the cost of its
' insurance less than that in any other
I company through Its larger aver- :
' age dividends, which it has not i
'â¢ had to reduce for the year 1899;
I its securities have largely in-
creased in market value; it has maintain- j
ed Its conservatism at every point, and is
t prepared with growing strength to repeat ,
in the future its unrivaled success of the
past fifty-three years.
Assets, Liabilities, and Surplus.
The admitted assets January 1, 1899, \
were $64,182,387 27; the total liabiliites were ;
?56.665,545 20, leaving a surplus of $7,516,- j
! 542 07. Of these liabilities $55,361,814 is the ;
; reserve from former premiums required
to meet the increasing mortality of the j
future from the increasing age of our
members, their premiums remaining uni-
form except as decreased by yearly divi-
dends. The legal standard of solvency :
requires this reserve to be computed on
the assumption that the companies will
earn 4 per cent annual interest as long as
any of the policies in the account may
continue; a possible period of sixty or j
seventy years.
In 1882. the Connecticut Mutual, alone
among the companies, anticipating the
great decline which has taken place in the
rate of Interest and is still in progress.
based its premiums and reserves for all .
I business thereafter on the assumption of
, earning only 3 per cent, as the highest
â  safe calculation for so long a future. This
1 makes our reserve $1,822,059 larger than it
' is by the legal standard of solvency, and
! our surplus correspondingly smaller. By
that standard our reserve liability is $53,-
-539,755, and our surplus $9,338,601. Thus
have we long been steadily preparing for
1 that which is now startlingly evident to j
â¢ all. , â
Insurance in Force.
The early months of the year gave
promise of considerable increase in busi-
ness, which was checked by the outbreak
and progress of the war; but so small
relatively were our lapses and surrenders j
that we, nevertheless, made a gain in the j
' amount of business in force. The per- !
sistence of our business is a most gratify- ;
! ing feature of our experience. It adds
i steadiness to all our operations, gives us
! the greater benefit of care in the selection
i of risks, and materially assists to keep
[ down the expense account.
We had in force January 1, 1899, 66,862
policies for $158,078,850; an ample business
for securing the most satisfactory results
: to policy-holders, and presenting less dif-
ficult problems in management than per- j
i tain to a business of several times greater
I magnitude. â &
A Favorable Mortality.
We had a very favorable mortality ex- ;
j perience for the year, the losses incurred :
i being so much less than those expected by i
the Mortality Table and provided for by â 
, our premiums and reserves as to make a
| saving of $541,268. While our death rate \
> varies somewhat from year to year, such j
! has been the care exercised in the accept- |
: ance of risks that the variations have so i
I far all been well within the amounts called !
; for by the table, affording very material !
I savings. In no year has such a saving
j failed to be effected.
The Interest Rate and Its Incidents.
The past four or five years have been ;
; notable for the great volume of loans paid
j off by borrowers, for a great diminution in
1 the demand for loans by new borrowers,
I the consequent accumulation of funds
; awaiting investment, and a decline in the
I rate of Interest pending a revival of de-
â  mand. The hard times of the early nineties
: with the panic of 1893"and the depres-
; sion following, made a great many solvent
I borrowers anxious to get out from under
; the burden or' debt and interest paying
and forced a great deal of foreclosure in
the case of insolvent or embarrassed bor-
rowers. The conditions have not yet so
far changed for the better as to re-estab-
lish the demand and the rates for money
It has, therefore, during the past year
been more difficult than usual to keen
money satisfactorily employed The
money received in payment for loans has
not been absorbed by loans of a like char-
y^L and Â£? s v, ha 1 d t0 , Beck investment in
bonds of a high class for security but at
a lower rate of interest. ." au ;
I fv, The conditions which have so affected '
â¦Â£ c r i ate ,2 f . ntere t have- not only caused ,
i the liquidation of many loans by fore- !
j closure, but have prevented the real es- i
tate market from recovering its normal !
activity so as. to cause : the reabsorption
of the foreclosed properties by individual
holders. The real estate market is the l
last to respond to either favorable or. un-
favorable influences. When the market >
recovers its tone there Is good reason to i
believe that our properties, taken as a
whole, will prove .worth all they have
cost. Our past experience under like con-
ditions fully justifies that belief. Mean- I
time, we are in a condition to await a re- i
turn to conditions which will enable us to
sell at fair prices.
The stocks and bonds which now form I
a large item of our assets (at a market !
value of over $20,000,000) are of the best '
character for security, yielding as fair a
rate of Interest as the times allow upon 'â 
Investments of the highest class. Only I
one item of these securities is In any i
questionable , condition. The city of Aus- j
tin, Texas: after receiving the money for
an issue or $40,000 of bonds and paying in-
| terest on them for fourteen years, has I
now refused further payment, and denies !
I its obligation, alleging a technical defect i
I in its own compliance with the compli- I
| cated laws of the State. The matter is
: being properly cared for. ,
This item aside, our assets are In a thor-
j oughly sound condition.
I The Distinctive Position of the Con-
necticut Mutual.
We desire to call most careful attention
' to the particular, and as we. believe, the
i peculiar value of the Connecticut Mutial i
I to its policy-holders and to the insuring
pui/.ic. and especially to those principles !
I and practices which so widerv distinguish !
: it from the great competitors, >
In ' the intense struggle between many i
of the companies during late years for
! pre-eminence In the volume of new busi-
I ness and ! premium Income and in - rapidity
and magnitude of growth, certain funda-
mental facts have been put aside by the I
companies themselves and concealed from
the public; false motives have been ap-
pealed to in support of schemes radically
efectlve In character, practices have
been widely introduced which are de-
structive In tendency and .vicious in every j
aspect; entirely false tests of success have
been set up to justify more than doubtful \
means, and the simple ends of real life In-
surance, and the j simple means ( and tests
of a real success have - been â¢. ignored, de-
nied > and - contemned. Some of the com- j
i najaiaa which have resorted to these |
LIFE INSUBANCE.
things have woh great magnitude; but it
has been done by persuading the public.
In the hope of personal profit, to invest in
schemes many of which avoid even the
name of life insurance, which in operation
destroy equity and all mutuality between
policy-holders, and which have been cun-
ningly devised to conceal from policy-
holders the enormous cost at which tho
competition has been and is being con-
ducted. Dividends are postponed for long
periods of years in the certainty that
those who do not continue on through
them will not have the chance to see the
effect of a high expense rate, and in the
hope that these will go out in such num-
bers that they will leave enough behind
for those who do continue through to
make them indifferent to the general high
Against the almost infinite number of
such plans, made to look desirable by va-
rious devices, we ask every man who has
a family to protect to carefully note, what
Is the real purpose, the true motive^ the
true methods, and the proper cost of life
insurance, and the manner in which the
Connecticut Mutual illustrates these
tilings in Its business.
The Beal Purpose of and True Motive
for Life Insurance.
When a man marries he makes his wife
practically helpless and dependent upon
himself. His children come into the
world utterly helpless and dependent on
him. He has created, of his own free
will, a helpless and dependent family.
They depend on him for protection
against their need and their aelplessness
Society looks to him to protect it against
the helpless dependence which he has cre-
ated. By every, obligation which can ap-
peal to unselfish affection, honor, and
conscience, he is bound to protect his fam-
ily against the helplessness and depend-
ence which he has imposed upon them,
and to protect society against the burden
which belongs to him because he has
made it. And this he does, ordinarily, by
his own productive labor. While he lives ,
he works and earns, and his earning sup-
plies his family's need and is their pro-
tection In their helplessness and depend-
ence, .
But his life is not certain for , hour ;
His family are under the constant risk of
losing it and all It does for them, and of
being left still heipless, still dependent,
with the protection gone. It is this con-
tinued risk which he has puc uoon them;
it is this unprotected helpless dependence
to which he hasexposed them; it is against
this which he is therefore bound to pro-
tect them. He is bound to provide at once
and to have always ready a surncient sud-
Btitute for his earnings after he is ffone.
There is but one nossible way to do all
this. Thrift and saving alone cannot do
it. If he lives long enough and saves, he
may after many years have enough for the
purpose. But that is as uncertain as his j
living to earn the daily uread. The fam-i
lly's risk is now, every day. The effect of ,
saving and laying aside in ordinary ways
is far off in the uncertain future. Th" ,
family needs instant and constant and full
protection against an instant and constant i i
risk. They can have It in but Just onÂ© ]
way; the rrian must take of his savings a
sufficient amount and use It as a life in-
surance premium. His small annual saving
so used will provide instantly and con-
stantly the protection they need and
which he can furnish in no other way.
Therefore he is bound to use life insur-
ance for their protection. That is the pur-
pose of it; that is the one thing it can do
that nothing else can. There is his only
true motive in It; an obligation which has
! no alternative except the denial of duty to
i those he has made helpless.
To the perfect accomplishment of this
; simple, single purpose and result should j
pvery incident of the business be adjusted.
I Its every dealing with the husband and :
father should be informed and inspired by j
the high motive which moves him to in-
voke its indispensable aid for the Instant
and effective protection of those whom he
must but cannot otherwise protect.
If it is his clear duty to use life Insur-
ance, then it is the clear duty of those ;
who administer it to make that use as
effective as possible to its true end; to '
: give him its sincerest, simplest, best help,
; at its least possible cost, and with an eye
I single to the family's most complete pro-
| tection.
The Purpose and Value of Mutuality.
Because life Insurance is the one and
only way in which men of moderate or i
small means can at once provide the nee- j
essary family protection, and because it |
Ik at the cheapest a matter of cost and a
pure expense to him who provides it. In !
order to make it as cheap as possible, and
so as largely available as possible, to all
who need it, it is sought to give it to each
policy holder at its bare, actual cost.
The cost of life Insurance is due to two
things: The death losses and the ex-
penses. In calculating the premiums to
be charged both these things are as-
sumed, as they cannot be exactly fore-
known. If the loasea are less than was
assumed, a part f that element of the '
premium Is saved. If the expenses are !
less than was assumed, a part of that
element of the premium is saved. If I
more Interest is earned on the
reserves than was assumed, just J
so much more of the premium Is
saved. If now these three items of sav-
ing are returned to the policy holders In
the proportion that each man's payments
have helped produce them, then each man
will have his insurance at its exact cost .
to the company, no matter what the
nominal premium on his policy may be.
He gets the most Insurance possible for
his money. That is what mutuality does.
That is what it Is for.
True Mutuality.
The Connecticut Mutual aims to make
this principle effective in its widest scope
and to Its highest degree. Not only has
it no stockholders to absorb these yearly
savings as tneir profit, but it has no Ton-
tine, Investment, or other special classes
of policy holders, with postponed or de-
ferred dividend periods, each man hoping
to make a speculation out of the accumu-
lated savings othrrs may have to leave
behind them by death or lapse during the
period. Its yearly savings whether from
a low death rate, a high rate of interest
or a low rate of expense, go directly back
to Its policy holders in the proportion in
which each man's payments have exceed-
ed the cost of his risk in yearly dividends.
So that year by year each man sfets his
insurance at its actual coÃt to the com-
pany and at the lowest cost which, by
careful selection of risks, good investment
and economy in expenses, the manage-
ment Is able to secure. No policy holder
gets the savings made on another man's
policy. No policy loses its savings because !
of the death of the Insured. His savings
are paid with the policy. In case of lapse
his contributions to the reserve are not
put into the deferred dividend speculation,
but are used as a single premium to give
paid up insurance for as large an amount
as possible in place of the policy which
has lapsed.
We give to each his own overpayments,
and to no one what of right, and equity,
and true mutuality, belongs to another.
True Cheap Insurance.
Obviously, that company which has the
lowest death rate, which earns the high-
est interest, and pays out the least for
expenses, will give insurance at the least
cost to its policy-holders, as a whole. It
will effect the largest sa\Tng*. If it re-
turns those savings in strict conformity
w|th the principles of mutuality It will i
also give the cheapest individual insur- I
ance on the average. We say "on the
average," because some companies which
make dividends so discriminate against
certain classes of policy-holders and In
favor of others, that while In the aggre-
gate and on the average their dividends
are very small, in certain cases they may
be large; a poor sort of mutuality.
Cost In the Connecticut Mutual.
The Connecticut Mutual exercises great
care in all that affects its death rate; It
confines its business to the healthy por-
tions of our own country. No desire for
size has led it to acquire business In
varied climates, under conditions of
widely differing effect upon life and
health, and beyond effective control. Its
medical service is organized with grreat
care, and the result of Its selection of
risks is shown In the very low mortality
and the great saving already referred to.
Its Interest rate is as high as is con-
sistent with safety, and has so far been
a source of large saving. With its 3 per
cent assumption its experience is likely to
remain relatively good.
Its rate of expense Is and always has
been less on the average than that of any
other, company. The expense rate of its
greatest competitors ranges from 75 to
100 per cent and over above that of the
Connecticut Mutual. Its savings from
that source are unequaled by any and ap-
proached by very few Indeed.
High' Dividends â Low Cost.
A3 a consequence of all this long-con-
tinued care and economy, the aggregate
savings of the Connecticut Mutual have
been greater than those of any other
company. Its annual returns or dividends
of these savings to its members have
been larger than In any other company,
unless In cases of exceptionally favorable i
treatment at the expense of others.
Therefore its Insurance has cost Its
policy-holders less, both as a whole and
Individually, than In any other company. \
LITE INSTJIIAKCE.
And the conditions which have produced
these results for more than half a century
are still fully operative in the care and
economy with which its affairs are con-
ducted, and in the contrasted degree in
which these quaJities appear in its most
active competitors.
Its Proper Clientage.
To those who desire to do fully, at its
least cost and to the utmost of their
financial ability, their duty to their fami-
lies, and to use life Insurance for their
protection and not for a speculation for
themselves, the Connecticut Mutual offers
the utmost that life insurance can accom-
plish, in Its simplest, clearest forms, of
perfect equity and perfect mutuality, on
the soundest basis of any, and at a lower
cost than has been achieved by any other
company. Greater service can no life
insurance company render.
The Witness of Fifty-Three Years.
In the fifty-three years of its work the
Connecticut Mutual has received;
For premiums..: $201,823,446 17
For Interest 82,05(5,095 30
For rents 7,664,770 S3
Balance profit and loss 1.090.559 08
Total receipt* $292,435,20144
It has paid death
claims for $97,151,410 74
Endowments and an-
nuities for 14,272,403 30
For surrendered poli-
cies 25.053.904 23
For dividends 58,523,938 &0
A total returned to
policy holders or
their beneficiaries,
being 96.71 per cent
of the entire prem-
iums received $195,003,657 17
It has paid for ex-
penses 26.000.53S 71
Taxes 9.623.63S 03
Total expenditures $230,623,133 31
Balance net assets, January 1,
1599 * 61.507.067 53
It has additional assets (see state-
ment) 2.350.657 53 !
Total assets $64,187,755 06
Nearly 97 per cent of the premiums paid
by policy-holders have been paid to their
beneficiaries or returned to themselves,
$Â«4.187,755 06 are held for the protection of
existing policies, with a surplus of $7,516,-
-542 07; and this has been done at an aver-
age expense rate of only 8.89 per cent.
This is an unmatched record; but Its
best significance lies in the fact that the
same principles which undelaid and pro-
duced these results are as fully operative j
to-day in the management of the company
as at' any time in its fruitful history: the
same prudent care, the same economy, tho
same true mutuality and equity, the same
soundness and strength, and the same un-
paralleled low cost. Respectfully sub-
mitted,

MUST HAVE
COIN FOR THE
HIGH SCHOOL
Its Closing Will Not
Be Tolerated.
FRIEND'S COSTLY NEGLECT
AN EVANGELIST MAKES A MIN
ISTER BLUSH.
Some of the Secrets of Running for
Office â Value of Endeavor Con
ventions to a City Is Set
Forth.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Feb. 20.
The comparatively paltry sum of $4000 j
5b needed to prevent Oakland's high ;
school from being closed for two months I
of this term, and there is a possibility
that this sum may not be obtained by the |
Board of Education. With a tax levy ab
normally high it is a crowning infamy to
an extravagant administration that an im
mense fortune should have been appro
priated to improve Lake Merritt and that
a trifle should threaten such a calamity
as would be the closing of the hijh school.
This is a serious matter, striking at the
very root of that which has long been
Oakland's greatest boast â her educational ;
facilities. No one with a particle of civic j
pride would dream of having the report ]
go out all over the West that Oakland i
had been forced to spoil one term in the
high school course and delay the progress '
of its hundreds of pupils for an entire ,
half year for the sake of $4000.
Yet there is apparently one Councilman
BO completely tied up to certain interests
that he fails to see the matter in this
light. That man is Councilman Wood
ward. Although it is proposed to put j
eums aggregating over $120,000 into Lake
Merritt and Cemetery Creek, Mr. Wood
ward actually grew dramatic in his ef- I
forts to convince his fellow Councilmen !
that the schemes around the lake should !
take precedence of education. This view !
is a.s farcical and illogical as certain wa
ter-rate arguments not yet forgotten by |
the public. Next Monday night there j
should be such a protest on the part of ;
parents presented to the City Council i
against the closing of the high school
that will make such an infamous action
Impossible.
Postmaster Friend did not do something
a few weeks ago that he wished he had
done, and the joke has been on Mm
ever since. About a month ago Mr.
Friend, who is well advanced In years,
went for a long spin on his wheel. As he
â¢was passing a corner a friend of his hailed
him and tried to persuade him to take out
an accident Insurance poMcy. The Post
master said he was making such good
progress in cyclism that there was no
need for any such precaution. Mr. Friend
rode two blocks and something went
wrong. He does not quite know even now
how It happened, but he has just paid a
steep surgeon's bill for repairing two ribs.
The morning after the accident, while still
â¢writhing in pain. Mr. Friend received a
huge bundle of correspondence. It was
from his friend, the accident insurance
man, and was a report of all the accidents
that had happened to the company's cli
ents and the generous wav in which the
sufferers had been treated. All through
the report were big red marks, and these
all referred to accidents on bicycles. The
Postmaster is now looking for that insur
ance man, though whether - have re
venge for the joke or to provide; for the
protection of his other ribs is not known.
In East Oakland a well-known evan
gelist from New Jersey, J. Whitcomb
Brougher, has been active for two weeks.
Last Sunday the evangelist brought a
blush to the face of the pastor of the
Tenth-avenue Baptist Church and also to
hundreds of the attendants in a manner
they least expected. Mr. Brougher is up
to date. There are no cobwebs on his
frock coat. He was attempting to drive
home the necessity of placing faith, even
where sight cannot aid it. To illustrate
this the evangelist quietly asked every
body how many people would believe him
. If he told them something in good faith.
Everybody, including the pastor and
church officers, raised his hand.
"That is very proper and pleasant,"
said the evangelist. Then he suddenly
stamped the floor, shot out his right
hand with clenched fist and roared
dramatically. "There is $100 in that hand.
How many of you believe it? " There
was an instant's silence, during which
the speaker looked at the Rev. C. M. Hill,
Superintedent Plaw, Precepter Vesper,
Professor Randall and a score of other
leading lights.
In response to his query one little boy
held up his hand, while everybody else
thought the evangelist was a practiced
hand at getting off a bluff. Without chang
ing his dramatic attitude the evangelist
opened his clenched fist and the $100
dropped to the floor. "Now," he said,
"that money is going to take me back to
New Jersey, where I shall tell my con
gregation how much faith an Oakland
audience puts in a New Jersey evan
gelist."
The blushing scene followed.
It Is a matter of surprise to me that no
legislator has ever attempted to secure an
amendment to the Australian ballot law
providing against that clearly illegal sys
tem of voting known as plumping. It ia
this iniquitous practice that has often re
sulted In debauching the personnel of
Oakland'B City Council, and which blda
fair to do It again. I do not see any more
argument In favor of declaring a ballot
Illegal because a man stamps one cross
too many than if he refuse to stamp the
necessary number. This of course only
refers to those sections of the ballot
marked "Vote for two" or more candi
dates. In Oukland everybody should vote
for four Councilmen at large. It has gen
erally been the practice for the vicious
element to combine on two unworthy can
didates and vote for them to the exclu
sion of all others. This idea carried to
an extremity would prevent the election
of four Councilmen, presuming it to be
possible that everybody who voted agreed
to "plump" for two. There are more elec
tions in California requiring five officials
than any other kind. That is to say, ev
ery school district and every town must
vote to elect five Trustees. In districts
â¢where the vote is very small a score of
"plumpers" can upset the will of the ma
jority. There are some school districts in
Alameda County where fifty votes are not
cast at an election of Trustees, and so
long as a certain number of officers Is
necessary to complete a board It should
be illegal to vote for less.
Since last week John L. Davle has made
the opening speech of his campaign. As
anticipated by Mr. Snow, Mr. Davie has
chosen the tax levy and a business ad
ministration of the city's affairs as the
basis of his campaign. Now that Mr.
Snow has declared that there can be no
other legal tax levy under the charter
than $1, which contention was made by
Mr. Davie four years ago, there is no
thunder in this issue for either camp. It
is a little early yet to compare the state
ments of the two leading candidates, for
Mr. Snow's speech a week ago was made
before the Municipal League, and the
meeting although public was announced
as not being a candidates' meeting. Next
week the Republicans will open the war,
and Mr Snow will doubtless settle all
doubts as to where he stands on every
The administration to which Oakland
will gladly bid a long farewell on April 1
has been, according to Mr. SnowÃ figures
the worst conducted, most extravagant
and unprincipled that has ever disgraced
the City Hall. The Auditor's figures show
that there will be a deficit at^the end of
June of nearly $53.000. and this with a tax
lew of $1 21. Mr. Snow docs not presume
to go outside of his Jurisdiction to advise
the Council what to do or what not to do.
But he declares without equivocation that
if all the plans and schemes now provided
for by contracts, ordinances and resolu
tions'be carried out. the city's creditors
will suffer enormous losses. The amount
of the fir-licit is Just about the amount
necessary for existing contracts concern
ing Lake Merritt. and Mr. Snow is in the
happy position of being able to say
told you so." for when the Council last
fall was parceling" out money as though
it had an unlimited supply Mr. Snow pre
dicted Just what has happened.
No one's experience of public life in ,
I Oakland can bo said to be complete with- I
! out it including at least, one "running for i
office." Some weeks ago it was my for
j tune, or misfortune, to be proposed for
I one seat in the City Council. Insignin
' cant as the circumstance may be, it has
! opened my eyes until I almost feel sym- j
' pathetic toward poor Individuals, who, j
i having no tangible means of subsistence,
I grasp at any political straw that is !
wafted their way in the hope that it will I
produce immunity from star%'ation and
ejectment. It is surprising how many j
â â¢friends" a candidate can find. Not mere- :
ly well-wishers, but friends who are will
ing to put their hands in their pockets, or
somebody else's pockets, "if you should
need a little money.'" There is no at
tempt at briber-., not at all. It is merely
suggested in a 'friendly way that such a
competitor is making a lightning canvass
and that somebody must be putting up for [
him. and that consequently it would be â 
nothing but right to help yon "just a lit- !
tie." Neither can it be said that in the j
event of failure .such a recipient of "kind- ]
ness" would be expected to return the
gift, but in the event of success, God help
that candidate's reputation if it should be
to the interest of such "friends" to use
him for some scandalous scheme.
Ordinary people have no idea of the
many elements that compose a commun- j
ity until they have a brush with politics, j
All kinds of elements are Introduced into |
a political campaign, no matter how in- j
significant it may be, for the purpose of
furthering the interests of such elements.
"Would you close saloons on Sunday?"
"Would you dose them altogether?"
"Would you reduce the liquor license?"
"Would you raise it?" are a few of the
questions floating in the air, and accord-
Ing to the answers given such or such a
block of votes is half promised. Nothing is i
done very definitely, nor in such a manner j
as would give a man a good oppor- I
tunity to produce hard facts before a j
grand jury. But such practices cannot j
help thinking it would be an experimental
have nothing else on which to depend ;
than the crumbs of politics. I cannot j
help thinking It would be an experimental j
policy to put a newspaper man in the city
government.
In May Oakland will entertain thou- [
sands of Christian Endeavor delegates to |
their State convention, and it is to be j
hoped. that the entertainment will be of as |
gratlfving a nature as that tendered to |
the World's Endeavorers two years ago.
It is a pity that the Supervisors could
not appropriate more than $220 toward
the entertainment fund, for any money !
spent in such a manner returns many fold
to the community. There are in Oakland
now several families of the most desirable
kind who came to California at the time
of the international Christian Endeavor
convention. They brougfct their little i
fortunes with them, settled down and are
to-day a part of Oakland. 1 have no
doubt that sim|lar circumstances exist in ,
every city in California. At the coming j
convention the delegates will attend '
from all corners of the State, and as
transportation inducements will be of
fered many will be attracted to this city.
Oakland does not have too many oppor- |
tunitles to show Its enterprise and hos- j
pitality, and this is an opportune chance
to proclaim to California that there are
better recommendations for this growing
city than the record of notoriously oad
local government.
STUART W r . BOOTH.
SAD ENDING OF A
BOY'S HUNTING TRIP
: CHRIS MILLER DIES FROM GUN
SHOT WOUNDS.
Fatally Wounded by the Accidental
Discharge of His Gun and
Dies Soon After.
OAKLAND, Feb. 26.â Christian Miller,
aged 16 years, and the sole support of his
mother, Mrs. A. L. Miller of Blossom
street, Frultvale, died at the Receiving
Hospital to-night at 11 o'clock from terri
ble injuries sustained through the acci
dental discharge of his gun while out In a
boat hunting in the creek thi3 morning.
Young Miller was alone at the time, and
it is supposed that he was in the act
of lifting his gun when the trigger struck
against a cleat in the bottom of the boat,
discharging one barrel. The charge tore
away the flesh of the right forearm and
also shattered the bones of the foot.
His agonizing cries were heard by an
other hunter named Gilligan, who towed
the boat to the foot of Grove street, and
with the assistance of Detective Quigley
and an expressman conveyed the injured
hunter to the Receiving Hospital. Drs.
Stratton, Jordan, Rowe and Horn were
immediately summoned, but deferred r< i
forming an operation, as Miller was too
weak troni loss of blood to stand the
shook. . , .
Once during the afternoon the lad re
gained consciousness and recognized his
mother, who had been Immediately sum
moned to his bedside. A gentle press of
the uninjured hand and he again became
unconscious and remained so until death.
"Christian was too good for this world
and they wanted him in the other," mur
mured the heart-broken mother, who sank
beside the deathbed, sadly bemoaning her
Deceased was a native of Oregon. He
was a boy of exemplary habits and the idol
of his mother. He had been stopping at
Shatter's wood yard at the foot of Jeffer
son street, where he was employed, for
some time. It is said his father deserted
the family some time ago and is believed
to be in Alaska.
WATER BATE ORDINANCE.
Cleverly Disguised Measure Will s-e
Introduced at To-Night's
Session.
OAKLAND. Feb. 26.â At to-morrow
night's meeting of the City Council, un
less the present programme miscarries, an
ordinance will be introduced fixing water
rates for the next fiscal year. It is not
certain that the necessary six votes can
be obtained to insure its passage. This
ordinance will come ostensibly from the
water committee, four members of which
are of the "Solid Six." It will be a
cleverly arranged affair, purporting to re
duce rates for very small houses, but will,
in reality, so it is claimed, give the water
monopoly a big increase of income.
The live members of the Council, who
oppose inflated rates, will, it is said, also
introduce an ordinance practically the
same as,that passed in 1897. and which is
based on" the most thorough investigation
ever made by a City Council
Two weeks ago The Call stated that
documentary evidence was in existence
which pointed to corruption so conclu
sively that it might be impossible for the

OPERATION CAUSED DEATH.
Autopsy Shows That Miss Annie X.
Jacobsen Was a Victim of
Malpractice.
OAKLAND, Feb. 26.â An autopsy per
formed to-day by Dr. Derrick, assisted
by Dr. F. T. Lamb, on the botiy of Miss
Anna K. Jacobsen, who died at the Les
ter House last night, has revealed con
clusively the fact that death was due to
malpractice. Dr. H. S. Buteau represent
ed the District Attorney's office at the
autopsy.
Dr. C. J. Sharp, who according to Miss
Jacobsen's ante-mortem statement, is re
sponsible for the young woman's death,
has thus far evaded the police and de
tectives. The authorities have also been
unable thus far to apprehend Madame
L. Jacquay, who Is charged with a similar
crime in the death of Mrs. Johanna An
derson.
THE SAN FRANCISCO* CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1899.
A PRISONER'S
DESPERATE DASH
FOR FREEDOM
Frank Smith Fights
With Officers.
IS ARRESTED FOR ROBBERY
A WILD RACjÂ£ THROUGH THE
ALAMEDA CITY HALL.
The Alleged Highwayman Is Clubbed
Nearly Into Insensibility Be
fore He Is Finally Subdued
and Handcuffed.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, Feb. 26.
A young Portuguese giving the name of
Frank Smith was lodged in the City
Prison about 2 o'clock this morning on a
charge of highway robbery. Deputy-
Sheriff Quinlan, the arresting officer, had
a desperate struggle with his prisoner
before he succeeded in subduing him.
Shortly before noon to-day, while prep
arations were being made to remove
Smith to the County Jail, he made a bold
dash for liberty, and gave the officers a
lively chase through the corridors of tne
City Hall before he was cornered, and
then he had to be clubbed into insensi
bility before he could be handcuffed.
Soren Paulsen, a Fruitvale dairyman,
was the victim of the alleged footpad.
"While driving along Park avenue toward
Alameda about 1 o'clock this morning, he
was stopped at a point about 100 yards
south of the broad-gauge railroad cross
ing by a couple of men, who commanded
him to climb down off the seal of ma
wagon. Paulsen lost no time in obeying,
and his movements were somewhat
hastened by the appearance of a couple
of pistols. The highwaymen relieved
Paulsen of $7 in cash and a pocket knift.-.
They then ordered him to head for Oak
land.
jbe dairyman was able in the bright
moonlight to get a good look at his as
sailants. He informed l>eputy Sheriff
Quinlan of the hold-up and gave the
officer a description of the two men,
which led to tbi arrest of Smith a short
time later. w .
Quinian ran across his man just as he
was leaving a saloon near the tidal canal
bridge. When ordered to throw up his
hands and surrender Smith made a grab
lor the officer. Ihe movement was so
sudden that Quinlan was taken off his
guard, and before he could recover him
self the two were rolling on the ground
engaged in a rough and tumble light.
Qmnian succeeded in subduing Smith and
brought him to the Alamedu jail. \Vhon
the prisoner was searched Paulsen's knife
and part of the stolen coin was luund on
him.
Paulsen swore to a complaint before
Justice Larue of East Oakland this morn
ing, charging Smith with highway rob
bory. When Quinlan went to the Alame
da prison to remove Smith to the County
Jail he neglected to profit by the expe
rience of the night and upon his prisoner's
promise to be good he did not handcuff
him.
As soon as he passed the doorway lead- :
ing out of Chief Conrad's office Smith at- I
tempted to trip Quinlan, and falling made
a dash down the corridor and ran up the
Inside stairway leading to the upper sto
rlea of the City Hall. Being Sunaay, the
doom to the main entrance were closed, !
and the desperate prisoner found himself |
trapped.
Sheriff Rogers and Police Officer Gunn
guarded the exits to the hall, while Quin
lan and Sergeant Schumacher went up
after Smith. He was found crouching near
the first landing, intending to make a run
by the officers as they ciime up the stairs.
They surmised what the man was up to
and ordered him to surrender. Instead of ,
obeying he ran toward the front doors and
attempted to break through the glass.
Seeing Sheriff Rogers and Officer Gunn on
the outside he turned and led the officers
In a race to the upper story of the build-
Ing and down the corridor to the City
Clerk's office. This was the end of his .
run and appreciating that he was cor- !
nered he backed up against the wall and
squared away to do battle with his pur-
Quinlan and Schumacher attempted to
close in on him, but his handy props kept
them at a safe distance. Finally it was
found necessary to use a club on the man
before he could be subdued, and he was
practically insensible when the officers
succeeded In handcuffing him.
It is believed that the prisoner is a des
perate crook. He is a hard-looking cus
tomer, and no one in this vicinity appears
to know him. His partner in the hold-up
is still at large.
ALAMEDA BABY ALMOST
DRIVES HORSE TO DEATh
LITTLE ROY GREENOUGH'S
HAIR-RAISING RIDE.
Urged on a Runaway With a Whip,
but a Calamity Is Averted by
a Cyclist.
Alameda Office San Francisco Cal
1428 Park street, Feb. 2G.
Roy Greenough, a curly-headed dare
devil baby, 5 years of age, drove a spirited
horse the length of Alameda to-day, and
while the people who witnessed the mad
race shuddered at the thought of the
baby's probable fate, he smiled, shouted
with glee, and holding the reins in one
of his tiny hands, occupied the other
lashing the horse's back with the whip.
The horse and its youthful driver dashed
along Enclnal avenue, passed the nar
row-gauge trains and traversed cross
streets without colliding with anything
and kept on the lively run until a ven
turesome wheelman overtook the outiit,
and, grabbing the horse by the bridle,
brought it to a standstill. The animal
was covered with foam from its long run
and was all but used up.
The rig belonged to W. E. Bryan of
West Alameda. He had loaned it to his
daughter, Mrs. J. R. Morris, and her
niece. Miss Eva Sharp, to drive to the
Christian Church on I'ark avenue. It was
tied in front of the house of worship when
Baby Greenough strolled along and climb
ed into the carriage. He thought he
would "play horse" while the owners were
attending divine service. He took hold
of the reins, but as the horse did not pay
much attention to his style of handling
the ribbons, he pulled the whip from the
socket and gave the animal a sharp cut
across the back. With a lunge forward
it broke the hitching strap and started
along Park avenue at a breakneck speed.
Insisted on a Drive.
OAKLAND, Feb. 26.â John St. John and
William Bruton, two young men, are de
tained at the city prison as yet only
charged on the small book. They Jumped
into a buggy hired at Kane & Daley's sta
bles and which was tied up in front of a
residence at Nineteenth street and San
Pablo avenue, and drove off with it. After
they had made the rounds through Bast
Oakland and West Oakland Officer Kyto
gathered them in.

J. J. VALENTINE
SPEAKS AGAINST
ANNEXATION
Says We Do Not Need
the Philippines.
EXPANSION IS CRITICIZED
LORD BERESFO-r D'S ADVICE NOT
TRUSTWORTHY.
Speaker Declares That "Yellow Jour
nalism" Is One of the Evils
Fostered by the Late
War.
BERKELEY, Feb. 26.â Imperial De
mocracy Is an ill-advised policy, conceived
in ignorance, fraught with hidden
dangers, backed by sophistical argu
ments and prompted by questionable mo
tivesâsuch is the view of J. J. Valentine,
president of the WeHs-Fargo Express
Company. It was the substance of a
very forcible lecture delivered before a
large audience in the First Congregational
Church on Dana street to-night.
Mr. Valentine entitled his address "Im
perial Democracyâ The Annexation of the
Philippines," and though asking his
listeners for their indulgence for express
ing opinions somewhat at variance with
the trend of popular .political ideas, held
their attention closely for over an hour.
He quoted largely from carefully com
piled statistics and views of eminent au
thorities, weaving them into the argument
which formed his discourse.
"That colonization has heretofore been
unsuccessful," the speaker began, 'is
j seen from the fact that three-fourths of
, the people engaged In colonial service are
, worn out in five years. The disastrous ef
j feet of tropical climates weakens and de
bilitates the white race, rendering It quite
unfit for active service. France's colonies
are a failure. Spain's possessions have
i completely ruined the mother country;
sickness, squalor, misery and debt is all
; they have to show for the greed of con
; quest.
"It has taken the race a million years
' to rise from the level of beasts to men; it
; took just fifteen minutes for men to fall to
the level of beasts when the lust of w;.r
swept over the nation last summer. That
war developed from four sources â yellow
journalism and hysteria, vengeance and
ferocity, militarism and despotism, igno
rance, ambition and greed. The contemp
: tibilitr of its origin has recently been
brought to light by state documents which
show that a few days before the declara
tion of hostilities Spain had ceded prac
tically all that we have since gained by
bloodshed, and that had we been forbear
j ing. the force of words would have done
} what swords were called upon to do. for
: the flag of Spain would have oome down
I without so much as the report of a sin
i gle gun. Nevertheless we have the -her! t
lof our strife, and now we propose to
ry the work of infamy one step fur
r by inaugurating a policy of despotic
>nization. the annexation of the Philip
â¢sotwithstanding Lord Beresford to ths
trary. the islands can never be a sub
: of interest to our people. They be
? to Asia and can never be made an
â gral part of the United States. Lord
esford is an English royalist, and car
lg his principles out we should under
ie our Government merely to attract
attention of European monarchs and
join In the groveling, grabbing contest
which they are carrying on. We might
adopt imperialism, but would that be in
accordnnce with representative govern
ment?"
Mr. Valentine here took occasion to
dwell at some length upon the unconsti
tutlonal consequences which, he declared,
would follow such a course as Philippine
annexation. He stated also that the
country was as yet quite unfit and still
more unprepared to attempt such an
undertaking. Turning to commercial ad
vantages, he continued:
Kit is a mistaken notion that commer-
I growth follows territorial expansion:
t the acquisition of land in the Orient
Is going to swell the volume of our trade
there. England. France and Germany in
their colonial history have demonstrated
this. Their export trade is rapidly full
ing off: ours Is as rapidly increasing. Why
don't their colonies prevent this? Re
cause such a notion Is contrary to all the
laws of trade. That trade follows the
fl;>g is an absurd notion, born of popular
1 jingoism. Our commercial position is as
sured without grabbing the land of alien
peoples.
"Upsides, if we need territory in the
Orient, why not conquer Korea and so
establish abase of trade which shall be
I somewhere near the center of distrlbu
! tion along the Asiatic coast? What
i earthly use can the Philippines be to us.
i situated as they are, miles and miles
! away from the southernmost centm- of
I European trade in Asia. Np distribution.
practically, goes on south of Hongkong.
yet we expect commercial advantages of
a permanent kind from Manila.
"In conclusion, the course which we are
facing is quite devoid of anything like na
tional glory. What glory is there in fur
nishing thousands of soldiers, when we
know that all this vast expenditure of
money must be paid In the end by taxing
the people? With the experience of other
colonizing countries before us. with the
despicable origin of our expansion policy,
with imperialism and all its consequences
facing us. with no commercial benefits
likely to follow, taken together with our
racial unfitness for the work, where is
either the advantage or the glory that
we expect to reap?"
WILL BOYCOTT THE
"HOODOO" LOCOMOTIVE
ENGINEERS AND FIBEMEN RE
FUSE TO ENTER THE CAB.
Will Petition the Division Superin
tendent to Retire the Unlucky-
Engine From Service.
AL.AMEDA, Feb. 25.â "H00d00" engine
No. 19, the death-dealing 1 machine of the
narrow-gauge road, will never turn an
other wheel unless run by a crew who
have less regard for their lives than any
of the engineers of firemen now employed
on the local division of the road. The
bloody record of the engine has filled the
railroad men with fear, and there ia a
presentiment among them that whoever
pulls the throttle on the "Hoodoo" or oc
cupies a place in the cab is doomed.
Since Engineer Jonas and Fireman
Colson lost their lives by the wrecking of
the locomotive at Second-avenue station
the locomotive has been at the Newark
shops undergoing repairs. In a few days
it will be ready for service again, and will
be sent out over the rails, probably to add
new victims to its list, provided a crew
to man it can be secured.
The engineers and firemen of the local
division have combined against the ma
chine. Acting for what they consider their
own protection they have pledged them
selves to have nothing to do with the
"Hoodoo." Their reasons will be Â«et
forth in a petition which will be presented
to the division superintendent requesting
him not to put the engine back in the
local service.
Almost from the time of its first run
over the narrow-gauge road No. 19 was
known among the employes of the com
pany as the "hoodoo." "It has been a
continual source of annoyance. When it
was not engaged crushing out human
lives, it was generally busy keeping itself
out of repair. A broken eccentric, %
dropped bolt or some other equally
malign thing was almost a dally occur
rence. Six months before Engineer
Jonas and Fireman Colson lost their lives
it ran off the trestle at Alameda Point,
killing Fireman Hickey. Engineer Bald
win, who was in charge of the engine at
the time, was so severely scalded that he
was laid up for many months.
GIRLS PLAY BASKET BALL.
University of California Team De
feats Mills College.
BERKELEY, Feb. 26.â Harmon Gymna
sium, on the University of California
campus, was the scene of a well-fought
game of basket ball Saturday afternoon
between the California team and young
ladies from Mills College, Oakland.
A throng of the fair sex crowded into
the building as spectators, but a careful
guard at the door jealously excluded
members of the opposite sex.
While California managed to run up a
score of 15 to 0, their superior weight and
excellent team work stood largely in their
favor, but for dash and quickness of
movement the palm was easily borne off
by the girls from Mills.
The girls lined up as follows:

ANYTHING IS EASY FOR
THE CZAR OF INGLESIDE
A SEQUEt TO
THE STAKE
RACE.
CORRIGAN'S POWER
How Spencer Hap
pened to Ride,
Judge Edwin F. Smith
Was Found in Good
Humor.
How Ed Corrigan's gelding Adolph
Spreckels captured the Gunst stake at
Oakland on Saturday last is past his
tory now. But how it came about that
the "iron chancellor" of Ingleside se
cured the services of Henry Spencer
to pilot the horse may be a matter of
news to many.
It will bp remembered that on Feb
ruary ir>. during the progress of the
last [ngleside meeting:. Spencer was
Buspended for ten days by the iudees
for a breach of turf etiquette â his
mount bumping another horse in a
race. His term of suspension would
thus have held good until Sunday,
February 26. At the time of the rul
ing the crack rider had accepted
mounts for several days ahead. The
judges allowed him one day's grace.
The well-known Sacramento trainer
and owner, Ab Stemler, had figured on
having Spencer toss the leg over Lode
star a day later, but was told by the
officials in the stand that he would
have to secure another rider. This he
was unable to do and scratched the
horse, thereby, no doubt, entailing the
loss of a purse. All efforts to have the
ruling set aside proved unavailing.
On Saturday last, Oorrigan surveyed
the list of eligible riding talent and his
face wrinkled. Turner, Thorpe, Bull
man and Martin had mounts in the
race. Piggott was too heavy. Then
the thought struck him, why not reach
the par of Kdwin F. Smith at Sacra
mento, and put Spencer on the back of
Adolph Spreckels. Nothing was easier.
The wires were touched, and the pre
siding judge of Ingleside wired the ore
SUPERVISORS
READY TO FIX
WATER RATES
Old Schedule Will
Probably Stand.
LACKMANN MAKES A PROTEST
BYINGTON ALSO STANDS FOR A
DECIDED REDUCTION.
Water Committee Allows Itself Only-
One Hour in Which to Pre
pare a Report to the
Board.
The Water Committee of the Board of
Supervisors will meet at 9:30 o'clock this
morning to propare a schedule of rates
for the present year. An hour later the
board will meet in committee of the whole
to receive the report of the Water Com
mittee. The investigation into the values
of the Spring Valley plant in actual use
closed last Wednesday evening. The
board having gone over the same ground
covered a year ago and obtaining nothing
new, the report of the previous investiga
tion was reintroduced into the record.
This was done to save expense of print-
Ing a new report. The figures presented
to the Supervisors by the water company
.are practically the same as those of last
year.
On Friday Chairman Phelps sent a no
tice to Messrs. Lackmann, Black, Aigel
tinger. Kalben and Attridge. the Water
Committee, that a meeting would be held
Saturday at 2 p. m. to consider the report.
Mr. Lackmann went to the City Hall and
waited half an hour for his confreres, but
none appeared. Mr. Phelps telephoned
Mr. Lackmann that there would be no
meeting of the committee until 9:30 o'clock
this morning, but gave no reason for the
change. As this arrangement gives the
committee but one hour to prepare a re
port on the vexing water question, it is
presumed that the committee intends to
readopt the schedule of a year ago, which
1b based on the statements furnished by
the water company. The board was re
quested by the representatives of the
company to adopt this plan.
If the majority of the committee de
cides to follow this course Supervisor
Lackmann will present a minority report,
which will recommend a radical reduction
in water rates. Supervisor Byington has
been collaborating with Mr. Lackmann
on this report. These gentlemen are, not
satisfied with the statement furnished by
the Spring Valley Company. The Bylng
ton-Lackmann schedule will, if adopted,
reduce the fixed rates 10 per cent and the
meter rates 15 per cent.
The minority report will knock $92,000
from the operating expenses of the com
pany. $16,000 from the item of dividends*
$26,000 from the floating debt (which these
two Supervisors say should not exist) and
$5000 from taxes. The capital stock is also
reduced, the Supervisors claiming the
company has watced stock 'for the pur
pose of mulcting the rate-payers.
REPENTANCE HIS THEME.
Father Cottle Addresses the Members
of the Calvarian Society.
The Lenten devotions of the Calvarian
Society, which were inaugurated the first
Sunday of Lent, were repeated yesterday
with impressive solemnity. The address
was delivered by Father Cottle, the pastor
of St Brigid's Church, his subject being
"And Christ looked on Peter,' and Peter
remembered the word his Master spoke.
. . . And he went out with Him."

cer permission to accept the mount.
Spencer rode Adolph Spreckels, and
mainly through his superb saddle work
the stake was placed to the credit of
the ex-ruler of Hawthorne.
At a gathering of horsemen down
town Saturday evening, the action of
Judge Smith was loudly denounced.
As a rule Ab- Stemler takes matters
philosophically, but his wrath and in
dignation knew no bounds. He said
if a California horse owner had no
rights, then it was about time to quit
the business. The incensed owner ar
bring us back to a dramatic scene when
Christ the Redeemer was upon earth. It
was at a time when He had passed
through the agony in the Garden of Geth
semane. He had been mocked and spat
on. He had undergone the suffering but
partial as yet tv that which was to come
after.
"If there Is a moment when we need a
friend," he continued, "it is in the dark
hour of trouble. We can't remember for a
moment whether the repentance of 'Peter
was genuine. He had been schooled for
three years by his Divine Master, yet iie
turned upon him and denied him. By the
words of repentance which he uttered in
the presence and to our Lord we are to
believe that it came from the heart. Hjw
are we to know as Catholics if we have
the same spirit as Peter. He might oave
tittered the words with sincerity. Repent
ance, however, does not depend upon
words, but the signs that are given. If a
Catholic man or woman is repentant, the
sign of that repentance is manifest."

SALOONKEEPER
CHLOROFORMED
AND ROBBED
Weird Experience of
John Strothoff.
UNCONSCIOUS FOR HOURS
LOST NEARLY $100 AND A DIA
MOND PIN.
He Was oust Closing When Two Men
Entered the Saloon, Drank Some
Beer and Awaited Their
Chance.
John Strothoff, a saloon-keeper at 45
j Third street, had a weird experience with
[ two robbers at an early hour yesterday
' morning, and he is still suffering from
j the effects of the drug administered to
I him.
Between 12 and 1 o'clock, just as he was
I thinking about closing up, two men en
tered the saloon and ordered two glasses
I of beer. He served them, and after they
drank the beer they continued to talk to
j each other. He reminded them that he
[ was going to close, and they ordered a
fresh supply. While they were drinking
the beer Strothoff counted the money he
j had taken in during the day and placed It
in the safe, intending to lock the safe
after the men had gone.
They showed no intention of leavinc,
and Strothoff, taking a combination gas
lighter and extinguisher and walking
from behind the bar, remarked: "I am
going to put out the lights and you had
better go." He has a faint recollection of
being suddenly pinioned and a handker
chief being pressed against his nostrils,
but that is all.
YVhen he returned to consciousness he
was seated in a chair in the bar room.
All the lights were out and daylight was
Just breaking. He experienced a feeling
of nausea and it was some time before
he could gather his wits. Then he
recollected about the two men and
immediately suspected that he had
been robbed. He hurried to the safe and
found that the money had disappeared
and also a diamond pin that was in the
safe. Altogether $96 70 in money had been
stolen, consisting of two $20 gold pieces,
a $20 greenback, six $5 gold pieces and the
balance in silver.
Yesterday morning Strothoff was too
sick to call at police headquarters to re
port the robbery, but sent a friend. He
was able to give an accurate description
of the two men, and detectives who havei
been put on the case expect to have them.
under arrest soon. The daring character
of the robbery, considering the neighbor
hood and the mode adopted, make the
police think that the robbers are old
hands at the business; and it is thought
that while they were using the chloroform
on the saloon-keeper and going through
the safe, a confederate was keeping a
sharp lookout. .
John Strothoff, the victim of the rob
bery, is an. elderly man, and the experi
ence he went through has left its traces
on his countenance. He gives a graphic
account of the robbery and description of
the three men who perpetrated it.
"A little after midnight Saturday." he
said, "two men pme into my establish
ment and ordered a round of drinks. I
was alone at the time and intended clos
ing up to catch the late car for my home
out near the German Hospital. They had
evidently planned their actions, for they
drank slowly, and when finished ordered
another "round," and finisned by buying
some cigars-. I told them I was going to
close up, but they paid no attention to me.
and as I came from behind the bar to
turn off the electric light in front of my
place they remained standing at the bar.
"I stepped, to my door and tried to turn
the lever that extinguished the light, but
was unsuccessful. A negro named Fipps
was standing In front and he volunteered
to help' me', and as I handed him the stick
the men behind me placed a rag saturated
with chloroform or some other anaes
thetic under my nose and I became dizzy.
Following out their plan they led me to
a chair and as I dropped into it. in a semi
conscious condition, I heard the voice of
the. negro, whom I am sure was an ac
complice, and also that of the men, in
conversation. One of the men said he
knew ray barkeeper and said he lived on
Clara street, and he would go and fetch
him. He asked the negro to go along,
and' I heard them both go out. When I
was : left alone with one of the robbers
the fumes got in their work, and I remem
ber nothing more until I awoke thirty
minutes, later. I was then alone and I
immediately surmised that I had â  been
robbed. I went behind the bar and found
my. safe open and the contents of a tin
hoiâ s9o and a valuable diamond stud
missing. Further search showed that $5
that- was on a tray, which was left for the
day barkeeper to make change with, was
gone, as was also $1 75 that was in the
cash register.
"While I was behind the bar Fipps
came in and said: 'I see you are all right.
I couldn't find your barkeeper.' I paid no
attention to him and he left. Shortly aft
erward some policemen looked in and I
told them what had happened. I de
scribed the men to th^in. Both men were
5 feet 9 inches in height and weighed in
the neighborhood of 150 pounds. One had
sandy hair, closely clipped and a slight
mustache, and wore a light suit of clothes
and slouch hat. The other had a heavy
black mustache and was dark complected.
I described them to Detective ODea and
also told him of Fipps. who I understand
has a bad record. The men were in my
place on Friday night and had some
drinks, and when they returned last night
I remembered them.
"As they did not leave me a cent I had
to stay in my saloon all night, not having
enough to hire a carriage with to go
home. In my twenty years of business I
never suffered from a like experience.
Detectives Ryan and ODea have been
detailed on the robbery, but up to a late
hour last night had not apprehended the
alleged negro accomplice or the daring
men whose crime, for boldness and exe
cution, equals any the Police Department
has dealt with in years.

POPULIST ROW
HERALDS THE
LOCAL STRIFE
Party Machine a Bone
of Contention.
OUTS ANXIOUS TO BE INS
G. D. GILLESPIE TALKS OF JEAL
OUSY AND REVENGE.
Chairman of the County Committee
Says the Charges Becklessly
Made by the Outs Are
Without Foundation.
The factional row In the local Populist
camp appears to be an early reminder of
the coming summer and fall campaign
somewhat as the wilow catkins are ad
vance heralds of summer. The perennial
Democratic fight will bloom soon and the
first thing the city knows the summer of
political joy will be here.
The local Populist party is small, but
fierce. It has a duality composed of the
ins and outs and the outs are obeying the
mysterious law ; of their being by trying
to be the ins at election time. So it is
quite natural that epithets, charges In
war paint, threats and tales should multi
ply. Control of the party machinery is
at issue. The fight is also between the
fusion and the middle-of-the-road wings.
The charges of misuse of campaign
funds and similar weaknesses recently
made by certain of the outs against the
last campaign committee and dismissed by
the executive committee a few nights ago,
have not been dropped, as appeared by
the report in yesterday's Call of an In
tention to institute a suit, which, it is
said, will result in some interesting dis
closures regarding campaign funds and
campaign methods last fall.
Last year the party was controlled by
the element called the "fusionists," led
mainly by George D. Gillesple and A. B.
Kinne. These gentlemen, with B. J. Pie,
Henry Huppert and M. Meakin, composed
the campaign and purity of elections
committees, and against them, and espe
cially against Gillespie and Kinne, the
wrath of the outs is directed. The most
active among the latter, according to tho
accused committeemen, are Dr. W. N.
Griswold, George H. Clough and Garrett
W. Smith.
"There are others in the background
behind these men," said George D. Gilles
ple. who is chairman of the new execu
tive committee, of which A. B. Kinne is
secretary. "It Is all an effort to get hold
of the organization. A new primary law
will be in effect this year, and these peo
ple hope to be able to throw mud enough
and make enough people suspicious of us
without risking any direct charges to de
feat us as convention delegates at the
primary.
"We court the fullest investigation of
the work of the committee and have tried
to get Dr. Griswold to make some specific
charges and in writing, but all he will do
is to shout 'boodlers' at the committee.
He began it in the county committee at
its meeting two or three weeks ago. I
insisted on an investigation, and it was
referred to the executive committee. For
this purpose the executive committee
met in committee of the whole with Dr.
J. A. Miller chairman. A committee of
five to investigate the accounts of the
campaign was appointed, and we let Dr.
Griswold name three members. The
committee was instructed to report last
Tuesday. At the meeting of the sub
committee Garrett W. Smith read a list
of charges which he wanted the sub
committee to investigate. Dr. Miller ob
jected that they were outside of the scope
of the committee's work, which was to in
vestigate the accounts, but asked Dr.
Griswold to move that they be referred
to the Grand Jury, which" he declined to
do and tore his signature from the
charges. Griswold wanted to make the
committee a court of inquiry, we to ap
pear with attorneys, a stenographer and
notary- public and answer questions. They
would be judge, jury and prosecutor and
we could ask no questions of them. We
couldn't see it that way.
"The accounts and bills of thejjommittee
were fully examined by the minority of
the committee and reported correct and
fair to the executive committee. Gris
wold for the majority reported progress
and wanted time and he said he could
prove that funds were improperly handled.
I insisted that he state facts and he re
fused, whereupon the minority report was
approved, clearing the committee of all
charges and that was supposed to end the
matter. Now they are talking in the air
again and threatening a suit. That is all
bumeombe and we only laugh at them,
while demanding specific charges.
"They have said that Mr. Pie of the
campaign committee went to Mr. Patton
and offered him the party indorsement
for $500. That is on a par with the rest
of their charges. Mr. Pie never spoke to
Mr. Patton in his life. Clough was secre
tary of the county committee and he got
mad because we didn't make him secre
tary of the campaign committee. These
fellows don't know what to do and they
are jyst throwing mud on general prin
ciples." *

DROWNED IN
THE BREAKERS
WHILE FISHING
C. McCarthy Swept
Out to Sea.
FELL FROM OLYMPIC PIER
A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS IN
THE PARK.
Policeman de la Guerre Sustains a
Fractured Ankle While in Pur
suit of a Speedy
Wheelman.
The ocean beach and park were the
scenes of a chapter of accidents yester
day. One proved fatal, the drowning of
Charles McCarthy at the end of the Iron
pier which supports the ocean main of the
Olympic Salt Water Company. This ia at
the foot of the hill leading to the Cliff
House.
McCarthy, accompanied by two friends,
William Clayton and Creany King, left
home yesterday morning on a fishing ex
cursion. They were casting their lines for
some time from the extremity of the iron
trestle when a heavy breaker rolled over
the top of the pier, entangling the lines
and drenching McCarthy. While attempt
ing to disentangle the tackle another
breaker caught him and he was washed
into the octan. The ebbtide was running
strong and swept McCarthy toward the
sea The swift undertow then caught him
and he was carried beneath the surface
before assistance could reach him.
The sea did not give up its dead yester
day. For hours McCarthy's companions
held vigil, but nothing was seen of their
friend. Decedent is a widower and leaves
one child. He was 28 years of age and his
occupation that of a shoefltter. He lived
with his mother at 533 Jessie street.
The Park Emergency Hospital staff had
little of the Sabbath rest. The accidents
to pedestrians, cyclers and drivers de
manded the attention of Dr. Sweaney and
his assistants, who patched torn skins
and set fractured limbs from early morn
till eve. The first patient was F. B.
Guernsey, whose frontal bone was
smashed by a baseball. B. Hassegios
was riding a bicycle whose gear proved
too lofty and seven stitches on his right
cheek will serve as a warning to speedy
"The most serious accident befell Park
Policeman de la Guerre, who started in
pursuit of a cyclist on bitumined Fell
street. The cyclist proved a scorcher and
de la Guerre tried to bring him to a stand
still. The bitumen was slippery and the
policeman's horse fell, throwing him with
such force that he could not extricate his
right foot from the stirrup so as to tall
clear. The ankle was fractured. 1. , N.
Lachman was another of the victims
brought in, but his injuries were slight.
Olympic Track Events.
The first two events for the track and
field championship of the Olympic Club
were run off yesterday at the club's out
door grounds near the Park. In the 100
--yard sprint Burgess, scratch, outdis
tanced his competitors and won handily.
He aJso won the 880-yard race, this time
with a 25-yard handicap. Next Sunday
the 440-yard run and the broad jump will
complete the programme and the prizes
will be awarded.
