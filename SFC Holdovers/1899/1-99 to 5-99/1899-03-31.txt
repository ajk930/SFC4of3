â General Mac-
Arthur's forces
entered Malolos
a few minutes
after 10 o'clock
this morning to
find the greater â¢
part of the city in ashes, having !
been burned by. the insurgents be- 1
fore evacuation.
It was learned that Aguinaldo
and his Cabinet left the city yes
terday, taking the archives of the |
tiled Filipino republic with
them. They have gone presuma- j
biy to San Fernando.
The insurgent army retreated
northward, after being driven out
of Malolos, and it is supposed
have the same city for an objec
tive point. The failure to capture
Aguinaldo is a source of sincere
regret, as it was believed his ar
would so dishearten his fol
lowers as to cause them to lay
down their arms, and the war
would end.
The Americans bivouacked at
Giguinto last night. The place
was not taken without a struggle,
which cost the Americans ten
killed and fifty wounded.
This morning baggage trains
were brought up and the bridges
repaired preparatory to begin
ning the advance upon Malolos.
Our scouts reconnoitered the
country within a mile of Malolos.
They did not find the enemy in.

many scattered bodies of armed

The main body of Mac Arthur's
force reached a point about a
mile and a half from Malolos
without tiring a shot at 8 o'clock,
and after a rest of an hour and
coffee the advance against the
city was begun. They immedi
ately met with some opposition j
from a few hundred of the enemy
who were hidden in the woods,
but soon drove them out.
Half a mile farther on they had
another engagement with about
aooo rebels, who stood for a feu
minutes, but finally lied precipi- j

caused by the American fire.
Another halt was made here, i
during which the troops were so
annoyed by the fire of the rebel
sharpshooters that they became |
impatient, and the order for the >
march against the city was given.
About' this time a dense vol- j
urae of smoke began to rise from j
Malolos, showing that it had been !
fired. The advance was made ns

SAX FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, MARCH 31, 1599.
THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS
WERE DETERMINED TO KILL
EVERY FILIPINO IN SIGHT
WASHINGTON. March 30.â
The following extracts are
from a report just re
ceived by the Red Cross
from F. A. Blake of Califor
nia, in charge of the Red Cross work at
Manila. The report is dated February
15. It says;
"Just one week ago did the fighting
actually commence, and the past week
has brought about changes little
dreamed of. The insurgents have been
pushed back on all sides until our cir
cle and outposts have advanced in some
directions as much as twelve miles.
"Our boys fought like tigers and
made such a name for themselves for
bravery, endurance and strict disci
pline as will, be handed down to pos
terity for ages to come. With the
thirty-three wounded last night at
Malabay, it brings our total dead and
wounded up to date a trifle under 200.
I never saw such execution in my life
and hope never to see such sights as
met me on all sides as our little corns
passed over the field, dressing wound
ed legs and arms nearly demolished,
total decapitation, horrible wounds in
chests and abdomen, showing the de
termination of our soldiers to kill every

for probably half a mile, when,
not coming up with the enemy,
orders were given to retire upon
Malolos.
The American casualties were
very light. None are reported
killed, while the wounded num
ber not more than twenty-five or
thirty. It is not known whether
the pursuit will be continued to
day. The insurgents are so de
moralized that it is not thought
they can be reorganized into a
formidable force, even if given
time, while a rest will be of in
calculable value to the Ameri
cans.
Calumpit, six miles north of
Malolos, will be the next point to
be gained, and orders have been
given for the transportation of
rails and bridge material to that
point. The country in that vi
cinity is rough and badly cut with
water courses, making an ad
vance necessarily slow. This is
an ideal country for guerrilla war
fare, and it is possible that the in
surgents may make a stand there.
Reports received at General
Otis' headquarters indicate that
General Hall's brigade had a
brush with the insurgents at Ma
riquina this morning, in which
the Americans suffered severely.

"The Filipinos did stand their ground
heroically, contesting every inch, but
proved themselves unable to stand the
deadly fire of our well trained and eager
boys in blue. I counted seventy-nine
dead natives in one small field and
learn that on the other side of the river
their bodies were stacked up for breast
works. The blockhouses filled with na
tives were stubbornly held and only
taken after bayonet charges. There is
where we had so many wounded.
"You see, they seek shelter behind
the densely wooded localities, while we
must advance in the open, and many ,
times only guess at their locality. I
witnessed many daring deeds of indi
vidual soldiers and officers, absolutely
defying death under a perfect shower !
of bullets. This kind of fighting and j
pushing forward has completely par- j
alyzed the natives, as the Spanish
would simply make a sortie and return
for a siesta and smoke,- wait for an
other week or mo-nth and repeat the
thing. A Spanish officer, surveying the
field, made the remark that the Amer
icans had no etiquette in warfare, not
allowing the troops to stop for a week j
after an attack. This rush is putting

The casualties in the light last
night at Giguinto are officially
reported as follows:
First Nebraska â Four killed,
thirty wounded.
Tenth Pennsylvania â One
killed, three wounded.
First South Dakota â Ten
wounded.
The troops are standing the

The infantry is doing most of the
work, as the artillery cannot be
brought up rapidly.
The enemy's loss was appar
ently small, the jungle affording
them such protection that the
Americans were unable to see
them, and in firing were guided
only by the sound of the Fili
pino's shots. The American ar
tillery was handicapped for the
same reason.
Last night's long line of camp

think when Aguinaldo's headquarters
is attacked they will cry enough and
surrender."
Blake goes on to tell erf arduous
work performed by Dwight, Tanner,
Nurrows and himself: how the Filipinos
fired on wounded being carried from the
front, and adds:
"We found all we could do dressing
wounded Filipinos after first satisfying
ourselves that our own had been at
tended to. The moral effect it had on
the natives to see their wounded being
so humanely looked after was electrify
ing. Had the order of things been re
versed our wounded would have been
treated to a machete stab.
"Our surgeon (Dr. Young of Utah),
while actually dressing a wounded man
on the field, was cmtrapped and his
throat cut from ear to ear, his fingers
cut off and otherwise most cruelly
mutilated, showing the treachery of the
natives and utter disregard for Red
Cross attaches.

This Week.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 30.âThe .Speaker
this week, commenting upon the diffi
culties of the Americans in the Phil
ippines and asserting that the new se
ries -of troubles, which is said to be in
evitable, even after the capture of Ma
lolos, probably puts an end to the Fil
pino republic, says:
"It must be noted throughout the
present struggle that the Filipinos have
put themselves in the wrong. The plea
that they were nghtintr in defense of
their rights does not hold good in the
case of Manila, which is the center of
European interests. It could not be
left to the mercy of revolutionaries. j
America, through no fault of her own. '
has become responsible for the goo.d
government of the Philippines, and is
bound to suppress Aguinaldo as we
suppressed Arabi Pasha, for the pro
tection of European interests in Egypt.
''It may be possible hereafter to give
the Filipinos local self-government,
even independence, but, for the present,
it is absolutely necessary to secure
peace at Manila for the maintenance of
the commerce of the islands. If, by
threatening this, the Filipino govern
ment made itself impossible, the fault
lies with itself and not with the United
States. For the present the gallant
troops in the newer west are the man
datories of civilization and Europe and
are carrying oil the war in the interest |
of peace."

BERLIN, March 30.â A brief
dispatch from Apia, Samoa,
dated March 30, says:
The bombardment con
tinues. In pursuance of military
orders the whites have evacuated
many houses.
The chiefs of the Tanu party, who
were exiled to other islands, have
been brought back from Upolu. The
firearms and ammunition taken from
the Tanu men on January 2 have
â  been returned.

The German Government was taken
. wholly by surprise with the news from
| Samoa. The Imperial Chancellor, Prince
j Hohenlohe, is spending his birthday,
j which occurs to-morrow, at Baden
Baden, and the Minister of Foreign Af
faiFS. Baron Yon Bulow. is enjoying a
fortnight's vacation in Holstein.
But a well-informed individual Bays
the Government here is skeptical as to
. Admiral Kautz' instructions. He adds
that the instructions for a bombard
ment were based on the British and
American claims that Mataafa was con
travening the Samoan act. But. the
official points out, the contravention
was not specific, and the Government
presumes that if the act was really in
fringed Horr Rose, the German Consul,
I would also have protested, as his Gov
ernment had instructed him to strictly
( onform to the act.
! The assertion that Herr Rose protest
j ed the deposition of the pro
| visional government is doubted, as it
' is claimed Herr Rose was instructed not
to identify himself Srith Mutaafa more
closely than the representatives of the
other powers.
There is considerable curiosity in this
city as to the effect the outbreak will
have upon the attitude of the United
States and Great Britain, but the view
remains that the final settlement will
be in no way changed by the outbreak
of hostilities, but must be arranged by
the joint action of the three cabinets.
The semi-official Post comments calmly
upon the new situation and says that
Germany will remain neutral.
The National Zeitung. commenting
upon the Samoan situation, says:
"While it appears that the American
and British representatives thought
the- Mataafans were contravening: the
treaty, the meeting held on the Phila
delphia had no jurisdiction because the
unanimous approval of the three Con
suls is necessary to make any ded
j sions legal."
The National Zeitung adds that fur-
J ther information is nei ssary in order
to show whether the Americans and
| British had sufficient reason for re-
Bortlng to armed intervention, and
; concludes by remarking: "Thus far
I the only result appears to have been
: destruction and anarchy."
Replying to the allegations of the
i Daily Chronicle of London that the
I United States Embassador here, An
drew D. White, has been pro-German
in his handling of the Samoan question
the Cologne Gazette says semi-ofri
cially:
"For some time we have noticed that
the efforts of the English press to cre
ate bad blood between the United
States and Germany have taken fresh
j impulse from the latest developments
!at Samoa. Not to mention otner in
; stances which show the mood of the
English press, the London Times a few
I days ago circulated a false story to the
; effect that Germany was intending to
I withdraw frc-m the Berlin treaty. Now
> the Daily Chronicle claims to know as a
< fact that the United States Embassa
dor, Mr. White, has aroused great dis
satisfaction in the United States be
cause of his handling the Samoan ques
tion principally from. the German stand
point.
"It would be honoring the Daily
Chronicle too much if we were to en
: deavor to protect the American Embas
sador against trie absolutely unproven
accusations of a serious violation of his
duty. It is sufficient to say again that
â  bitterly and with a talent for in
venting false reports the English press
is pursuing everybody who is suspected
; of being apt to- foster the good and
friendly relations between the United
Sta.tes and Germany."
ROSE, CHAMBERS, OSBORN
WILL ALL BE WITHDRAWN
Perhaps a New Set of Officials
Can Keep the Peace in
Samoa.
NEW YORK. March 30.â The Her
| aid's Washington correspondent send*2
the following: Pending action by the
three governments looking to the set
tlement of the Samoan controversy
Rear Admiral Kautz and the command-
Ing officer of the British cruiser Por
poise will maintain the status quo in
the island?.
This agreement was reached at a
conference to-day between Secretary
Hay and Sir Julian Pauncefote and is
understood to have been acquiesced in
by Baron yon Sternberg, First Secre
tary of the German Embassy.
It can be stated authoritatively that
the administration while deprecating
the existence of such a state of affairs
in Samoa is not alarmed over the situ
ation and in fact it is expected the con
flict between the American and British
warships and the Mataafans will re
stilt in the immediate settlement of a
question which otherwise might have
been long drawn out.
It can be further stated that Chief
Justice Chambers, Consul General Os
born ar.d Herr Rose, the German Con
sul, will all be withdrawn. This action
will not, however, be taken at once and
may be dependent upon the findings of
the commission, proposal for the ap
pointment of which is understood to
have been submitted by this Govern
ment and to be under negotiations.
From ihe official standpoint there is
a discouraging lack of information and
I was told at the State Department to
day that Consul General Osboin had
been instructed to send a full report of
the trouble to the State Department.
It is expected that Rear Admiral Kautz
will append his statement to that of
the consular officer.
OFFICIALS AT WASHINGTON
ARE HOPEFUL OF PEACE
Do Not Express a Belief That
Germany Will Turn Ugly, What
ever They May Feel.
jL WASHINGTON, March 30.â The seri-
condition of affairs in Sar.ioa en-
the attention of oinciala through-
Kut the day and there were confei
ftt ihe White House between the Pr> si-
Hdent and Secretary Hay, and at the.
â State Department between the S
and the British Embassador and
w Baron yon Sternberg, first secretary
â  the. German Embassy. But out oi" i\
rot a word of additional informatiui:
was contributed from any official
source. The only autnoritative stau -
ment came from the Navy Departiu
ving a brief dispatch from Admiral
Kautz. This threw no light on the
latest outbreak and, owing to a tangle
of d&tes, it served only to further in
the mystery. In view of the fact
thai the fighting was widespread and
long continued and the Foreign Offices J
at London and Berlin had been officially
advised .of the affair, it was regarded
;^ somewhat strange that the State
and -Navy departments should be en
tirely without information on a bom
bardment by an American admiral, l.'p
to the clost_- of office hours it was stated
that nothing had conic from any of
our representatives in Samoa dealing
v.ith the outbreak of hostilities.
Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British
Embassadur. w< nt to the Staie Depart
ment at 11 o'clock, accompanied by his I
secretary, Mr. Elliott, and conferred i
with Secretary iiay. As this was the
retj.i'ar diplomatic day little signifi- ,
etince would have attached to the call
under ordinary circumstances, but with
British and American warships co
operating in a bombardment, more than
-Lial interest attached to the call.
There is no doubt that the serious de
y'elopmenta in Samoa were discussed.
While there may be a dearth of official
information, at the same time the ac
tual events carry out what haw b
anticipated and give r. basis for intel
ligently considerin-g the further joint
action of the two governments in the
complete settlement of the entire Sa
moan trouble. Both nations are acting
in complete accord, hot only as to the
general solution of the Samoan prob
lem, but in particular with reference to
the force exerted by the British and
American naval commanders.
â As to the German attitude, It is stated
positively in a quarter thoroughly fa
miliar with German official sentiment
that the outbreak now reported can un
der n,o circumstances be construed as
an overt act against Germany nor as a
C&8U8 belli. This is from such a source
that it largely removes the possibility
of international complications. As an
evidence of the conciliatory sentiment
<f the German Government' it was said
to-day that the note delivered to the
department last week urged in behalf !
< f the German Government, that the !
gbod relations existing between two
such nations as the United States and
Germany would not be interrupted by
a matter of such comparative unimpor
tance as an official dispute in Samoa.
It is said that the German Government
probably would have accepted Admiral
Kautz as a sort of umpire, laking his
decision as final, but that the objection,
quite forcibly expressed to the StaK-
Department, was the manner of his go-
Ing to Samoa while, friendiy exchanges
v.ere go-ing on -without notice to Ger
l .any,
The German Embassador has received
nÂ© advices and no Instructions relative i
jÂ«0 the- reported bombardment, and there i
evidence thus far that Germany I
will protest or assume a bpllif,
o tbne. From the German standpoint the
|rio c st serious aspect is that the bom
bardment will excite public feeling on
berth sides of the water, leading to pop- |
ul^r outbursts which will overcome the i
efforts to secure a settlement.
"â¢One of the latest propositions toward!
â¢c. Settlement is that three commission
ers 'be appointed, one from each coun
try, to meet in Samoa and sit as a court
in settlement of the difficulty.
The State Department has not yet
received official advices. The demon
stration is regretted, but the opinion is
exp.Â°pscd that Admiral Kautz acted on
whAt "vas his best judgment and infor
mation. The State Department ac- I
knowledges that no permanent agree- j
ment can be reached under the treaty j
in A l , hkh all three powers do not agree.
and ttte hope is thru s<.-m^ settlemehi
of the. difficulty may be brought about
when it becomes apparent that the

CANDIES FOR

Sweets That May Remove the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 30.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: A determined effort is being
made, by the commissary department
of the army to make.soldiers forget the
bad beef given to them during the last
year. They are to have candy in fu
ture. Perhaps with an idea of sweet
ening the meat this addition to the list
of soldiers' edibles has been decided
upon.
Before the departure of Secretary Al- j
gr-r from Washington he approved of I
this circular, which was issued to-day: j
"The Secretary of War authorizes the i
following articles to be kept on hand i
for sale as staples to officers and en
listed men, viz:
"Articles â Sundries: Candies.
"Varieties â that have good
keeping Qualities.
"Unit of weight or measure âPound.
"Kinds of unit preferred âOne-half I
pound."
This circular has occasioned much
comment among officers of long service, j
who ridiculed the idea of lugging candy !
along to feed troops engaged in arduous '
work.
"Think of sending candy to men who !
are fighting before Malolos," said an
army officer. to me to-day. "If some of j
the beef is supplied to them it .might J
have the effect of taking the taste out :
of their mouths, but I am afraid it I
would be ruinous to their complexions.
I would suggest that a large quantity
of oranges be sent out to Manila, and a
stick of lemon candy and an orange be '
furnished to each man. The sight of !
such dainties would doubtless make the
Filipino mouth water, and who knows
but that it might bring about the end .
of the rebellion.
"I am afraid, however, that while a .
stick of candy might suit some of the |
enlisted men of the regulars, the vol
unteers would prefer a higher grade. j

29).â Secretary of the Navy, Washington: â 
Situation is improving since the telegram
of the ISth, via Sydney, X. S. W. â 
â¢ KAUTZ.
The President has been informed of
the situation and very much regrets
that serious trouble had arisen, but has
requested full information from our
officials in Samoa at the earliest possi
ble moment. It is learned that the dis
patch of Rear Admiral. Kautz, dated
Samoa, March 16, to which he referred
in his cable dated Auckland, gave the
result of his investigations into the
situation after his arrival. His con
clusion fully sustained the contention
of the British and American Consuls
which was in exact accord with the j
conclusion already reported by the
British naval commander, Captain
Sturdee, of the Porpoise.
The dispatch of the 16th probably loft :
Apia on or prior to the 10th instant. j
The German Embassy here received
advices forwarded by the same steamer
to Sydney which reported the arrival
of Rear Admiral Kautz and said that
he called a meeting of the Consuls |
aboard the Philadelphia for the 11th. [
So far as the text of the dispatch given !
out to-day goes absolutely no mention j
is made of the result of the meeting j
aboard the Philadelphia or any of the j
subsequent events reported in the dis
patches. Through the advices given to
the public by the Navy Department it
Is only known that Admiral Kautz's
investigation sustained the position
taken by the American and British
Consuls and that the situation since the
date of that report has improved dur
ing the time before the last brief dis
patch received to-day via Auckland
was sent.
GERMAN PRESS NOW
REFRAINS FROM COMMENT
LONDON. March 31.â The Berlin cor
respondent of the Times says: Pend
ing further Information from Samoa the
German press refrains from comment
calculated to embitter the controversy
or to imperil the pending negotiations.
The events that have occurred are de
-6 mainly because they may in
fluence public opinion adversely to the
Government's policy of cultivating
England's friendship. It is feared they
may give occasion to a suspicious and
mistrustful section of the public to re
proach the Government with the first
fruits of its rapprochement with Eng
land and the United States. On the
other hand no Inclination exists to form
premature judgment on the action of
Admiral Kautz and the British and
American officials.
The Times says editorially: "All
three- Governments concerned deserve
credit for the sensible and conciliatory
temper displayed over the events in
Samoa. Obviously no solution is ac
ceptable under present conditions save
the maintenance of the Berlin act. but
Great Britain is ready to concert with
the other powers any measures for im
proving the local situation, such, for
instance, as disarming the natives and
forbidding the Importation of arms."
BRITISH REPORT

WASHINGTON, March 30.â The Brit
ish Embassy here has received advices
from Samoa in the shape- of a dispatch
to th': British Foreign Office from its

is confirm) ! h r ' advices already
received by th<-: Associated Press. It
says that the- rebel faction advanced

Expansionists Wince,
BOSTON, March 30.â A letter bearing
the date of February 4 and signed by
100 or more of the most prominent men
In and around this city, headed by ex-
Governor George S. â¢ Boutwell. com
mending the attitude in Congress of
Senator Hoar and inviting him to ad
dress them at a future date, was made
public to-day.
Accompanying it is the letter of ac
knowledgment from Senator Hoar,
bearing date of yesterday, in which he
says:
I do not think there is any reason per-
I sonal to me for holding such a public
nn-eting. Undoubtedly there should De
and there will be many public meetings
j the country over to protest against
trampling under font the rights of a
I brave people struggling for their liber
â¢ ties, the violations of the principles of
our own constitution and of the Declara
i tion of Independence, and of the- contin
uance by the American people in the cost
ly and ruinous path whicn has brought
other republics to ruin and shame, which
I will dishonor labor, place intolerable bur
j dens upon agriculture and fasten upon
1 the republic the shame of what President
i McKinley has so lately and so truthfully
i declared to be criminal aggression. But
! I think it will be wiser to have meet
ings of that character a little later rather
than just now. We do not yet know
I whether ihe present war for the subjuga
tion of the people of the Philippines is
to continue indefinitely or whether there
is to be a speedy submission to the over
whelming power of the Vnited States.
If the war shall shortly be ended we
shall then be able to discuss the ques
tion of our national duty freo from the
disturbing influences which exist always
when the country is at war. If, on the
other hand, the war shall long and in
definitely continue, the people will he
ein to feel the burden of increased debt
and increased taxation, the loss of life
and health of our youth and the derange- |
ment of trade and peaceful industry.
Senator Hoar says further:
The blood of the slaughtered Fili
pinos, the blood and the wasted
health and life of our own soldiers,
is upon the heads of those who have |
undertaken to buy a people in the i
market like sheep or to treat them as
lawful prize and booty of war, to im
pose a government on them without
their consent and to trample under
foot not only the people of the Phil
ippine Islands, but the principles
upon which the American republic it- ;
self rests.
The law of righteousness and justice
or which the great and free American
people should act, and in the end, I am j
sure, will act. depends not upon paral- I
f latitude and meridians of longi- i
tude or points of the compass. It is the â 
Bame yesterday, to-day and forever. It ,
is as true now as when our fathers de

FROM MALOLOS, via Manila,
March 30.â The advance began at
2:30 o'clock this morning along
the railroad. The First Brigade
was held in- reserve. Fire was opened
cm the enemy on our extreme right.
The Nebraska Volunteers got the brunt
of it and ran for the enemy's positions.

The Nebraska Regiment lost thirty

The Pennsylvania Regiment lost one

TJie South Dakotas lost two wounded.
The advance was in a skirmish line,
but was barred by jungle and lagoons.
The advance continued for a mil^ with

ing gone. Two natives came in under
a white flag and begged our protection.
General Mac Arthur told them to re
turn, saying we would not harm non
combatants. The natives left, but al
most immediately the enemy's outpost
fired down the railroad track on Gen
eral Mac Arthur and his staff.
On the advance of our men the
enemy's outposts withdrew. Two in
surgent trenches were passed deserted.
Immediately in our front the first
trenches of the insurgents about Malo

A hard light is expected. We are
bivouacking here to-night and move on
to Malolos to-morrow.
SUPERVISORS STEADFAST.
< Have Not Reconsidered Their Recent
Action Prohibiting Betting
at Race Tracks.
The statement printed in a morning
paper yesterday to the effect that the
Supervisors contemplated modifying
their recent action against horse racing
is branded as untrue by the members of
the board.
"What purports to be an interview with
me on tho racing question has been
f>rinted." said Supervisor Collins, "but
t is absolutely false. I was not inter
viewed and the sentimentK credited to me
do not express my views. The writer
was romancing."
"If tho racing question had been dis
cussed 1 would have heard something
about It," said Supervisor Holland. "I
attended no meeting, as alleged, and the
matter of a reconsideration of our re
cent action has not been broached to
me."
SENATOR GEORGE F. HOAR,
clared it in 1776. It is as binding upon
William McKinley to-day as it was upon
George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.
The only powers of government the
American people can recognize are just
powers and those powers rest upon the
consent of the governed.
No man during this whole discussion
has successfully challenged, and no man
will successfully challenge:
â¦ 4
â f Firstâ The affirmation that un- 4
+ der tho constitution of the I'nited 4
4 States the acquisition of territory, 4
-â¦â  aa of other property, is not a con- 4
+ stltutional end, but only a means 4
-â¦- to a constitutional end. and that, 4
-4 while the making of new States 4
4 and providing a national defense 4
4 are constitutional ends, so that we 4

COMIC OPERA
SINGER LOSES
HER REASON
WILL BE SENT TO A PRI
VATE INSANE ASYLUM.
She Imagines She Is Being Pursued
by a Relentless Enemy, Who
Wants to Kill
Her.
Lilly Post, who has achieved consider
able success as an opera singer, is locked
up In a padded cell in the insane ward
at the Receiving Hospital. Her friends,
realizing that her mind was failing, last
night concluded to have her locked up
pending an examination as to her sanity.
The unfortunate woman imagines that
pho is being pursued by a relentless en
emy who is determined to kill her. After
being placed in a padded cell she sang
several snatches from comic operas,
which were, listened to with rapt atten
tion by the other inmates and the at
taches of the hospital. Tier sweet voice
could be heard some distance away and
attracted a crowd of passers-by, who re
fused to disperse until ordered to do so
by the police.
The unfortunate woman, it is claimed,
exhibited symptoms of a decayed mind
shortly after her return from Australia,
where she had spent several months, fre
quently appearing in comic opera.
She returned to this city a short time
ago and secured an engagement at the
Alhambra.
At the conclusion of her engagement she
actrd strangely, and a grave suspicion
w;is felt that she was losing her reason.
It was not until several days ;>po. how
ever, that she showed unmistakable signs
of insanity. While walking along the
Btreet, it is said, she would suddenly stop
and listen to some imaginary song. She
would join In the chorus, her melodious
voice being heard some distance away.
After being placed In the cell Miss I'usi
piteously to be released.
"1 am not crazy." she declared. "Please
do nor let them send me to an asylum."
She then became violent and demanded
to be allowed to go home. It is the inten
tion of her friends to take her to some
private asylum, where they earnestly
hope by careful treatment that her men
tal balance will be. restored. '
Some .sears ago the California song
stress made a decided hit ai the Tlvoll by
hei Bweel voice. She gained considerable
notoriety at the time ny refusing to ap
pear In tights. She has a mother living
in this city, as well as two brothers-
Ralph Post, the well-known song and
danci artist, and "Stan" Post, the famous
angler.

C S. Mellen, president of the Northern
Pacific, is registered at the Palace with
his wife. They arrived yesterday in a
special car from St. Paul, and are here
merely on a pleasure trip.
Mr. Mellen is probably the highest sal

States to-day, his compensation being
the same as that of the Chief of this

directs the destinies of the system run

Two years ago Mr. Mellon was vice

these, as Thomas Jefferson said, "are

But if the republic is to violate the law

HARD LIFE
WITHIN THE
FIRING LINE
Graphic Story of the Cam
paign as Told by a Cali
fornia Boy's Letter.
EAT AS THEY SHOOT
Food Secured Under Great Difficul
ties and Devoured at Intervals.
Tale of Two Heroes.
W. T. Moran. of the First California
Volunteers, who was a student at the
night High School, has written an in
teresting letter to this city under date
of Manila, February 20. in which he
says: ' ,
For ten days during the fight in which
Caloocan wa? taken our regiment was
working under stress of a great emti
gency There was very hard fighting,
with little time for sleep. Lack of sleep,
in fact, caused the greatest suffering till
some of our officers hit on the plan or
having the shelter tents just back of tne
trenches. And now when there is a call
to arms our boys just roll out of their
tents and into the trenches and are ready
for business.
The insurgents have made some very
fierce attatcks at this point, many times
coming within forty or tifty yards of the
trenches. They have never been able to
stand the fire quite long enough to reach
us, though. It was during one of these
attacks that Neilson and Packer, two pri
vates of Company F of ihc First Califor
nia, lost their lives. They got beyond the
firing line, and Neilson was hit and j
wounded. Packer could have got back
all right, but he would not leave his
chum. When we band boys went out !
after their bodies we found the ground j
strewn with piles of empty shells and j
beaten down in a way that showed they
had made a desperate fight to the very
end.
The boys have to resort to all sorts of
expedients to get anything to eat here
during the heavy fighting. About a week
ago the firing line of one of the regiments
had a lot or beefsteak sent out to them
in large paper bags. A soldier would
pick out a steak and get a firm grip on it
with his teeth. He would then pass the
bag to the next man and go on fighting.
When a soldier had a few minutes' rest
he would i>ut it in on the steak. On a
moment's notice he would start in rushing
the insurgents again with the meat in hi 3
mouth.
One regiment, the Pennsylvania, drove
the insurgents two miles after they got
the steaks. It was one of the few charge*
in which the boys did not rush forward
with cheers and yells. The reason they
did not do so was because they could not
afford to lose any food, and when they
stopped some of the men were still chew
ing the remnants of a very dirty beef
steak.
Our trouble Is due to not having
enough men. We dare not go very far
from Manila now. as the insurgents are j
likely to attack it at any time. We are ;
all hoping for reinforcements, as there ;
are so many insurgents that our troops j
are almost worn out watching them.
Our task is made particularly difficult i
since we cannot tell who are friends and i
who foes. Often wo have passed an oid
man whom we thought harmless. Later,
when our troops would rout out some
sharpshooter who was annoying us In the
rear we would discover him to be the
same apparently harmless old man who,
absolutely regardless of the consequences
to himself should he be discovered, had I
placed himself in some shack or other |
go> d position and started in to pick off j
any American he could B<
Our boys discovered a' man about SO
years of age tied in a tree two days ago.
He had but one leg. so his companions I
must have boosted him up and tnen |
made him fast. He had not succeeded j
in hurting any of us, but that he had
done his best was attested by the num
ber of empty shells under the tree. The
troops, instead of taking him down, rid
dled his body with bullets.
On Sunday week (the sth inst.) about
100 insurgents got into an old church and
our First Regiment could not dislodge
them. Heavy puns were brought up, but !
still the Filipinos would not come out. j
They stayed in the building even while :
the "church was burning down over their
heads.
They are all there yetâ all good Fili
pinos now.
We find it necessary to destoy the
churches as we go along. They have been
used as forts by the Filininos all over
the country and enable fTie brown sol
diers to put up a good, stfff defense, as
the walls are from ten to fifteen feet
thnk and they have loopholes through
which rifle.-, can be thrust and fired, mak
ing it absolutely necessary to employ ar
tillery in taking them.'
The artiilt ry boys urn nil right. If it
were not Cor the Third Artillery and the
Utah Battery we would often have suf
fered severely where they have made
victory easy, 'in fact, we owe most of
our success to them.

BRINGS BLUSH OF SHAME
TO THE CANADIANS
Sir Hibbsrt Tupper Attacks the
Government for the Conduct of
Joint High Commissioners.
OTTAWA. Ont., March :',Â»â *- In the
House of Commons to-day Sir Hibbert
Tupper. Conservative, made a bitter at
tack on the Government for the manner
in which it had conducted thinp
Washington before the High Comm:.-
He said that the Canadian Commit
era were not acquainted with the subjects
under discussion, ami thus they allowed
the United States Commissioners to takft
advantage of them. It was enough, he ex
claimed.' to bring the blush of shame to
the face of any Canadian when ho con-:
â  1 the position taken by the United
a Commissioners In regard to the
Alaskan boundary. The reason for the
â  l States taking that extraordinary
attitude, he said, was owiiin to the
ies ilt-livered by members of the
Liberal party in past years.
Bir Hibbert devoted the greater part
of a lengthy speech to attacks on The
policy of the Government in the i ukon
district where, he said, the Government
had allowed Its agents to terrorize and
toh the people. _
"THE LORD AND LADY
WARWICK COMPANY"
Countess "Babbling Brooke" Has a
New Scheme to Startle English
Society.
NEW YORK. March 30.â A special cable
to the Journal from London says: The
renowned house of Warwick, whose beau
tiful, brilliant, much-talked-about and .
much-talking Countess "Babbling Brooke"
is forever startling English society, has
come forward now with a sensation
which will cause more than nine days of
wonder.
There was issued to-day a prospectus of
the "Lord and Lady Warwick Company.
Limited," by which historic Warwick
Castle and its adjunct estates, priceless
relics which are among: its furnishings,
rich collieries, the great income which the
Countess has in her own rightâ to short,
everything appertaining to the family, is
converted into stock.
The step is original. It is astounding,
but nobody is surprised at anything the
Countess of Warwick may do, and no
body doubts that the "limited company"
idea is of her devising. It is a conceit
which society, having troubles of its own,
will study with care and deep interest.
The Countess, ready of speech and im
pervious to gossip, makes no ado aoout
the matter at all. At Warwick Castle to
day she spoke to the Journal correspond
ent in a very matter of fact way about
the new company which is built upon
such ancient holdings. She said: it
was simply a business arrangement en
tered into for the purpose of concentrat
ing and developing the Warwick proper
ties. The chief object in view is to work
the collieries on a. large scale in order to
create a large revenue, which will be de
voted to freeing the estates of the bur
den of debt which at present weighs on
them so heavily."

GOMEZ SAYS THE
PEOPLE OF CUBA
ARE UNGRATEFUL
Weary of the Whole Thing and
Would Like to Go Back
to His Home.
HAVANA, March 30.â Governor Gen
eral Brooke has almost made up his
mind to send the $3,000,000 given to pay
the Cuban soldiers back to the United
States if the Cuban Military Assembly
does not give up the army roll.
"You may as well do so and not trifle
much longer," said Secretary Algerr,
when discussing the matter two days
ago In conference with General Brooke
and General Gomez. The latter
that such a course would serve the As
sembly right.
Anyway, the impression Is spreading
that the Governor General may return
the money to Washington and it is
stirring up fresh feeling against the
Assembly. General Ernst called upon
the Cuban general, Rafael Portuondo,
chairman of the Executive Committee
of the Assembly, three days ago and
asked for the rolls.
"Do you come from General Brooke.'
asked Portuondo.
"Yes," replied General Ernst.
"Officially or unofficially?"
"I come unofficially," answered the
rican officer.
"Then I cannot give them up, re
. Portuondo. "I can only do so on
official recognition,"
\ â¢ le of United States troops would
ibly be sent to take the rolls of
the military administration if they
km .' exactly where they were, but
there is a feeling that a mistake might
be made and the administration placed
in the light of over-anxiety and possi
bly be laughed at.

Farms Saved by River
Improvements.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND, March 30.^One of the
principal features of 'the plan of river im
provement recommended by the Commis
sioner of Public Works was the construc
tion- of a concrete weir on the Yolo side
of- the Sacramento River at a point two
miles above the Elkhorn ranch, for the
purpose of regulating "the flood discharge
through the Yolo basin by confining to the
river channel the utmost volume that it
would safely carry without endangering
the' levee system and the important agri
cultural interests on the west bank of the
river This recommendation was indorsed
by Major Heuer, government engineer.
and approved by the auditing board. Che
weir or easement,- as it is frequently
called, was completed <ast November at a
cost of $26,541 54. It la 2000 feet in length
and fifteen feet in width. The concrete is
arched, one foot in thickness and with
four-foot anchorages at each? side; There
is a double row of sheet piling ten feet

is a riprap live feet wide, .and the apron,,

of its character in the United States. His

monuments may crumble and stone and
brick may succumb to the wear of years
the , eisement ought to stand for

in the United States. . I do not believe
there is a piece of work in all Europe that
e< ClS9BVand for many years prior it .was
impossible to maintain a levee system on
the west bank of the river. Eyer> year
CTeat' crevasses were furrowed out to a
&i near corresponding to the low

Throuah theY crevasses a tremendous
volume of water poured into Yolo vasin.
and The water thus diverted left a track
of devastation many miles in widthiand
extending almost to Rio Vista, .to
County As a result some of the mo

cally valueless and many farms were

put up and maintain substantial levees
The crevasses were filled and good ll

portunity to test the efficiency of the ease

and particularly gratifying, to ail con

river reached the 23-feet stage at Sacra

partment of Public Works knew that the
time for testing the casement was at

the weir at midnight Friday. The river
continued to rise rapidly, and by 2 o clock
Saturday afternoon a sheet of flood water
2000 feet wide and 15 inches deep was
pouring over the easement. Captain Hall
of the auditing board. Engineers Nurse
and Randle. Commissioner Leake and a
party of friends made a careful inspec
tion, and all agreed that the* easement
was working admirably and will ac
complish all the beneficial results claimed
for it. The levees were In good condition
find the crests of all were from three to
live feet above the level of the river.
The flood water diverted by the ease
ment was running back into the tule dis
trict, which in time- will be drained by the
canal. There was- no water on the farm
ing land anywhere from the weir to j
Clarksburg. The farmers were cutting,'
wood and plowing and- seeding with no .
apparent feeling of insecurity. But for
the levees and this easement the flood
waters of the last storm would have cov
ered nearly all of this land, and the loss
to the farmers would have been reckoned
by the thousands and tens of thousands.
Th" question of the utility and effec
tiveness of the easement seems to have
been fully demonstrated. It will deepen
and improve the channel of the river and
increase Its carrying capacity by con
fining a larger volume of water within its
banks, and it will greatly facilitate the
disposal of flood waters, and. incidentally,
It will greatly aid reclamation.
Additional Electric Power.
SANTA CRUZ, March 30.â The Big
Creek Company has ordered an additional
electric plant, sufficient to furnish 275
more horsepower than at present, making
a total horsepower of 675. This will give
the company three different plants. The
additional power is necessary because of
the' demand of the California Powder
Works here, which alone needs l.".O horse
power. In addition the company fur-
Dishes power for the electric railway and
lighting system. The new plant will be
installed within sixty days. -
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. 31 ARCH 31, 1899.
In the course of a conversation with
an old friend from San Domingo to-day
General Gomez said: "I am ready to
go home. I am tired of this jangle
with the Assembly. I have learned
something about these people which I
did not know before. They are an un
grateful people. They do not appre
ciate what the United States Govern
ment has done for them, a service
which I am assisting.
"These Assembly commissioners have
run off again to the United States to
beg for money, while I, who have a
wife in San" Domingo, have not money
enough to bring her here. But there I
do have a house and mieht be sure of
enough to live on. I am old and tired
and I feel like going back."
The organization of the so-called Cu
ban National party is proceeding.
Meetings are held nightly and to-day
the promoters issued a manifesto to the
people <>f Havana, calling upon them to
unite their efforts to organize ward
committees with a view of disseminat
ing information preparatory to a na
tional convention. This movement, it
is said, is due to the approaching elec
tions, but it has already developed a
split in the eastern districts, where the
Cuban federalists have organized to
promote a republic. The latter under
taking is not recognized here. In Ha
vana the national party finds its oppo
nent in the Liga Patriotica, an out
growth of the recently dissolved Junta
Patriotica, which is working along the
same general lines. These disconnected
efforts to establish a national party are
regretted by the best Cuban element, as
ultimate disaster is clearly foreseen.
GOOD OUTLOOK
FOR BUSINESS
Trade Brisk in America
and England.
â  . Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. March 30.â The Statist this
week- takes an optimistic view of the
business outlook here and in America.
It points out that the activity of trade
throughout the world is due to calmer
political conditions, and referring to
America, it says:
"Speaking broadly, trade in the
United States is growing marvelously
and is likely to continue to grow unless
the new crops prove very bad indeed,
or something altogether unforeseen oc
curs.
"There is more uncertainty respect
ing the probable course of the money
market than politics or trade. The
probability appears to be that there
will he no such rise in rates in th<-
New York money market as will lead
to the shipment of much gold from
Europe to the United States before
summer. Of â¢ Â»urse the true balance
of Indebtedness to the United Statt-n ia
not quite redressed. The United States
is still employing money in Europe, es
pecially in Germany, and that money
can â¢be withdrawn whenever it seems
desirable, but it is not probable that
money will become so dear in New
York that it will'be profitable to with
draw the sums now employed from
Germany and ship them across within
tlit- next few months.
"It will be different when the crops
begin to be moved. If money continues
â mployed in Germany on anything
like the scale it is now employed it will
be withdrawn when the rates rise much
and Germany will be compelled to draw
from England and France, and later, if
the stringency in New York increases,
gold may be shipped from Europe in
considerable- amounts."

Him.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 30.â James J.
Corbett, former champion heavy-weight
pugilist, and his wife had a quarrel to
night at One Hundred and Twenty-fifth
street and Eighth avenue, and the
woman appealed to a policeman for
protection, declaring she was in fear
of violence. Several hundred persons
who witnessed the altercation gathered
around the couple and blocked the trol
ley tracks on Eighth avenue while Po
liceman Charles Snyder of the West
One Hundred and Twenty-nfth-street
station used his good offices in settling
the dispute between the pugilist and
his wife. They had been out for din
ner in a restaurant on One Hundred
and Twenty-fifth street, and evidently
had begun there the quaxrel which was
continued in the street.
At the time the thoroughfare was
crowded with pedestrians, many ot j
whom recognized the big pugilist, who
for several years has lived in Harlem.
It was noticed that the- couple were
quarreling. Mrs. Corbett spoke ex
citedly and he appeared very much ex
cited. Crossing over to tht.- wt-st side of â 
Eighth avenue they paused underneath i
the "L" structure, apparently intending \
to take the southbound electric car o-f
the Eighth-avenue line. They stood
there talking in an animated tone for j
several minutes, when suddenly a |
scream was heard and Mrs. Corbett j
ran over to Policeman Snyder, who
was standing on the opposite corner.
Throwing her arms around the blue- j
coat's neck she begged him to save her J
from her husband.
"Save me from that man," she cried.
"You must not let him hurt me. I
won't go back with him. He will strike
me."
Corbett ran after his wife and Sny
der asked what was the matter. Mr:
Corbett clung tenaciously to the police
man meanwhile, apparently fearing
that if she let go she would by as
saulted.
"He won't hurt you," declared the
policeman in soothing tones.
â¢Yes he will, too," broke in the gob
bing woman. "He will hurt me if you
do not protect me. As a woman and a
citizen 1 demand your protection."
â¢What's the matter. 'Jim." You
wouldn't strike her, would you." asked
Snyder.
'She's trying to ruin me by making
a scene here," said Corbett, who haÂ«l
noticed the crowd. "She's slck > and
does not know what she is doing."
Then turning to his wife he asked her
to go along with him, but she positively
refused. He then lost his temper and
swore.
"The brute. Oh! policeman, please
save me from him," repeated ihe al
most hysterical woman to Snyder.
Take her home and she will be ail
right," suggested the policeman.
"No, no; never. 1 will not s> home
with him. You can take me to the po
lice station, but 1 will not go Â»sith
him," she cried.
"I'll go home with you," declared
Snyder, "and see that he does not Harm
you."
A cab was then called and .he woman
entered it, after the policeman had
promised to join her Inside. Corbett
Bprang inside and telling the driver to
drive him around the park slammed the
doi i and drove off. At his home in
West One Hundred and Nineteenth
street later it was said they had net

PUTRID, SPOTTED
BEEF REJECTED IN
LARGE QUANTITIES
Commissary Gampfer Swears
Armours' Agent Said Meat
Was Chemically Treated.
WASHINGTON', March 30.â There were
two original witnesses before the army
beef Inquiry court to-day, and two former
witnesses were recalled. Lieutenant
Gampfer, who was commissary of subsist
ence at Lakeland, Fla., and Major Crelgh
ton Webb, who was on General Lawton'a
staff In Cuba, testified for the first time.
Colonel Woodruff of the commissary de
partment and Mr. Morehouse, the Tampa
agrent for Armour & Co., who superin
tended the supply of fresh beef to the
troops at Lakeland, were recalled. Major
Webb's testimony dealt almost entirely
with the canned roast beef, which he pro
nounced as useless as an article of food.
Lieutenant Gampfer said a representative
of the Armours, whom he took to be Mr.
Morehouse,' had told him that chemical 3
were used to preserve the beef. This Mr.
Morehouse, when recalled, denied.
To-morrow some of the medical officers
who served in the Cuban campaign will
be examined.
George A. Gampfer, a clerk living In Cin
cinnati, Ohio, who was a lieutenant in tha
First Ohio Cavalry during the Spanish war,
occupying the position of regimenal commis
sary while the troops were camped at Lake
land, Fla., testified first. For a time he oc
cupied the position of brigade commissary. He
di scribed the manner of receiving the fresh
beef at the depot and said it came in an
ordinary express car, wrapped in burlap bag
ging Two or three total assignments of meat
were rejected. He stated that much of the
beef had been sour, acrid and bitter and emit
ted a disagreeable od ir wh-n the burlaps were
removed. There were spots of a light green
ish hue on the beef when the bags were re
m ived showing it to be tainted. Mr. fiamp.fr
said that on one occasion while the agent for
Armour & <"<>. was present his attention was
called to the spots, and he replied that the
beef was all right, saying. Bald Mr. Gampfer.
"the spots are due to the cnemlcals wo put on
the meat to preserve it and prevent its spoil
ing within the Bixty hours called for by the
contract." .
This agent said that it wns impossible to
keep the beef in good condition for that length
of time. He stated, however, that thereafter
he would have the beef put up in tin boxes.
This he did. but the meat continued to come
with spots on it.
Mr Gampfer then presented a memorandum
kept by Captain farmichael, his predecessor a?
brigade commissary, showing what meat had
been rejected from the Ist to the 17th of Au
gust. This showed that the total consign
ment was rejected on the sth, 6th and 7th of
t; that 282 pound* were r-fused on the
: oJ the month and that no entries were
on two other days. On some o< â¢
chunks were cut out ot the meat and con
demned. Mr. Camp first thought Mr.
was the agÂ«Tit who had spoken of the
use of chemicals. The conversation had taken
place in the presence <:" Captain Carmichael
(who afterward committed suicide) and Dr.
Castle. .
Mr. Gampfer had got the impression that
some kind of a liquid composition had been
tor glossing the meat over, but he had
n> t given the matter much attention, as he
Bupposed that if chemicals had be>>n used they
were harmless. Mr. Gampfer was then ex
cused, subject to recall.

General Miles Returns.
WASHINGTON. March ik).â General
Miles returned here to-night from his
trip through New England.
Major C. Webb, who waa General Lawton a
inspector general, gave testimony concerning
the meat Issued in the Santiago campaign, re
ferring especially to the canned roast beef.
'â¢It was not food," he said. "It was non
nutritive, stringy, fibrous and had not the
taste. It looked like the fag-ends of beef
steak. It was opening your mouth and letting
the moon shine into it It was not satisfying,
something we did not want and could not give
away even to the Cuban troops, who preferred
hard bread."
Major Webb said that he had tried to eat
the beef occasionally when very hungry, but
never received any satisfaction from it, ex
cepting after vegetables were procurable, when
It was used as hash to some advantage.
"You do not. then, regard it as a suitable
ration for the army?"
"I do not." Major Webb replied. "It it a
weighty thing to carry and it is a waste of.
time to eat it."
Major Webb said that he had found the re
frigerator beef generally good, though some
of it became putrid in the hot climate. He had
never heard of embalmed beef until he re
turned north. '
Colonel C. A. Woodruff, purchasing officer for
the Commissary Department at New York,
was recalled. He said he had rejected some
tenders of canned roast beef, but he did not
remember the names of the bidders in any
such cases.
Colonel Woodruff stated that in one instance
canned beef which had been shipped to Liver
pool. England, was brought back to this coun
try and sold for the use of the army. This
purchase amounted to 350,000 pounds. The beef,
as he understood it. had been stored in Ar
mour's warehouse' in Liverpool and had been
sent abroad with the view of selling it to the
British Government. !â * â¢ - '
Colonel Woodruff had letters read from
representatives of ; various firms engaged in
canning beef, all faying that the beef sold
to the army was of first-class quality and of
the same quality as the beef shipped to for
eign countries and sold to the Navy Depart
ment in large quantities. The witness said he
heard many complaints concerning this beef
from officers returning from Cuba, but that
one or two of them spoke favorably of it. He
also said that a considerable quantity of the
beef sent to Cuba had been returned to New
York and that he had tested it and found It to
be in excellent condition and palatable food.
In conclusion Colonel Woodruff asked permis
sion to make, a remark as the senior officer of
the Subsistence Department. saying: "Whether
it succeeded or not. the Subsistence Depart
ment was animated by a desire to do all It
could for the benefit of the line of the army."
Mr Morehouse, Armour's agent at Tampa,
was then recalled. He said there had been two
instances in which the entire proffer of meat
had been rejected at Lakeland and on three or
four other occasions a portion of the. consign
ment had been refused. He recalled a visit
to Lakeland early in August, when one con
signment was rejected, and to his surprise he
found the beef lying on the platform. He had
then had a conversation with Captain Car
michael, but he did not remember that there
was any other person present except Lieuten
ant Dixon. He did not remember to have then
seen or to have ever met Lieutenant Gampfer.
who I id testified that Morehouse had said
that the meat had been treated to a chemical
process for preservation. No questions had
been addressed to him concerning the chemi
cal preservation of the meat. He had never
used any expression to any one to indicate
that chemicals had been used.
Cross-examined. Morehouse said he believed
his memory as to the rejections would he more
reliable with the exception as to dates than the
memorandum of a commissary officer of the
army.
HOMEWARD CRUISE
OF THE RALEIGH
Incidents Since Leaving-
Manila.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
FAY A 1.. Azores, March 30.â The
United States cruiser Raleigh. CaDtain j
Joseph R. Coghlan. â  from Manila, on
December 15, is coaling here, will coal
at Bermuda on April 8. and expects to
reach New York on April 15.
The Raleigh has been having: stormy
weather in the Atlantic, but has been
behaving" splendidly and proves to be j
a good seaboat. All are well on board.
This is the first of Admiral Dewey's [
squadron of warships to be bound for j
home. She has on board a number of ]
men who belonged to the crew of the
flagship Olympla.
Many changes in the personnel of the
Raleigh have been necessitated since
the battle of Manila. She participated
in all the movements about the Philip
pine Islands, i. c.. in the battle of Ma
nila Bay, the capture of the Corregidor
forts, the capture of the gunboat Cal
lao, the bombardment and capture uf
Subig and the bombardment of Malate
fort, forcing the surrender of Manila.
After leaving Manila, ort December
15 the Raleigh stopped at Singapore.
Colombo, Bombay, Aden. Port Said.
Alexandria. Malta. Algiers and Gibral
tar. In all the British colonies, the
officials of the British army and navy
and the civilian population gave the
American warship an enthusiastic
welcome, showing her officers and crew
every form of courtesy. Dinners with
American decorations and American
national music were given to Captain
Coghlan and his officers everywhere, in
marked difference to the reception of
the Raleigh on her outward passage
two years ago. Governors, generals
and admirals and other high officials
all wished to visit and inspect the shiu.
The Raleigh still has her war paint
on. At Singapore she met a Spanish
transport having on board troops and
sailors from Manila. Although flying
a warship's pennant, the Spanish ship
lowered her colors and permission was
granted the Spaniards to visit the Ra
leigh, where they fraternized with the
American sailors, who gave them much
needed food and clothing. Many of the
Spaniards showed the Americans
wounds inflicted upon them by the
shells of the American fleet. The quar
antine from Bombay was waived at
Aden.
At the island of Malta, in the Medi
terranean, the Raleigh met the British
Mediterranean fleet, consisting of ten
battleships and a number of cruisers.
The British sailors extended a most
cordial welcome to the Americans, and
the sailors of the fleet and the soldiers
of the garrison entertained the crew of
the Raleigh ashore, the best of feeling
prevailing. Daring her stay at Malta
the Raleigh was crowded with British
redcoats and bluejackets.
The American officers were enter
tained at Cairo by United States f'onsul
Harris and all the British and Egypt
ian officers were present.
The French at Alfriers showed a
marked difference. There was no re
ception except from the British and
American residents, although the
! French officials were polite.
At Gibraltar the crew of the Raleigh
saw the Spanish fleet commanded by
Admiral Camara. It consisted of six
ships und was anchored in Algeciras
Bay. The Spanish fleet and the Ra
leigh sailed at the same time and pro
ceeded close to each other. The Ra
leigta hoisted the Spanish fla^ and sa
luted it. The salute was promptly re
turned by the Spanish admiral from
his flagship, the Emperador Carlos V.
The Raleigh in two years has cruised
36,000 knots.

SAN DIEGO, March 30.â Ellen
Ward, the 13-year-old daughter of Mrs.
John Ward, a widow livins n^ar Mor
ena dam, fifty miles east of this eitv.
was abducted yesterday by a Yaqul
Indian named Jose Garcia, and both
are believed to be in the mountains of
Lower California, or on the desert near
the Cocopo mountains.
The girl's father was an Irishman
and was killed, about two years agro by
failing upon a knife. The sirl's mother
is an Indian. Since her fathers death
several young Indians have hune
around the ranch, and Garcia, d Yaaui
from Sonora, made love to the widow's
young daughter. He was forbidden to
come around the pic-- on account of
the girl's age, but yesterday, without
the knowledge of anybody except the
girl. Garcia stole into thu house and
boldly abducted' her. She is not Known
to have made any resistance.
They were seen going toward OaniDO
and the boundary line in the evenine.
and as soon as the girl's mother was
notified she sent one of her employes
after Garcia.' The man started out
prepared to shoot Garcia, if necessary,
to regain possession of Ellen, and i 3
now on his track.
Word was sent to Campo requesting
that Constable Elliott join in the chase,
but the officer is on the desert and can
not be reached.
Garcia is a hard character, about 2t>
years old, while the girl, besides beinc
young is nearly white and rather ore-
Possessing. The affair has caused
great excitement in the vicinity of
Campo, and several cowboys expect to
assist in reaching Garcia and the girl
within a day or two.

He Was Resigned â¢to His
Fate, and Help Came
Just in Time,
An Interesting .Story as Re-
lated by J. K. Bruce. *
Mr Bruce is a prominent man of Selig-
man, Ariz. He says: I was given up to
die Was thin, weak, pale and suffered
pains in my back and limbs. My feet
would swell, and I was puffy under the
eyes. Eyes were sunken. â¢ Local doctors
said I would never get well, for I- had a
serious kidney disease. Your Hudyan
remedy has cured me. It has removed
every symptom, and I am to-day a sound
and "healthy man. I cheerfully recom-
mend it to all sufferers. I am yours
truly . J. K. BRUCE.
Such letters as the above come to us
every day. There can be no better proof
as to the efficacy of Hudyan than the
evidence of people who have used it.
In the treatment of all Chronic Diseases
no remedy acts so well as Hudyan.
Since Hudyan exerts its influence upon
the entire' organism, chronic diseases
readily yield to its peculiar curative
powers.
NERVOUS PROSTRATION, whether
due to overwork, worry, emotion, mental
strain or severe shock, is promptly cured
by Hudvan.
"CHRONIC RHEUMATISM, that fearful
disease which causes so much" suffering
and distress in every community, is be-
coming less common through Hudyan'i
influence. Hudyan counteracts the acids
in the blood, stimulates the kidneys to
perfect action in order that the impuri-
ties will be discharged, thus relieving arid
curing the rheumatic pains.
PALPITATION OF THE HEART,
fainting, dizzy spells, headaches, weak-
ness it matters not what the cause, are
quickly relieved and cured by the won-
derful Hudyan.

FARMERS GET WATER FROM
THE FLUME.
The City Physician of the Southern
Town Starts to Make an In
vestigation at â¢
Once.
Special Dispatch to ; The Call.
SAX DIEGO," March 30.â water
supply in the Cuyamaca reservoir,
owned by the San Diego Flume Com- ;
pany and situated fifty miles northeast ;
of this city on the summit of the Cuya
maca Mountains, is said to have been
poisoned. Recently a big cyanide plant ;
was erected at the Stonewall mine, near
the reservoir, for the purpose of -work
ing over the tailings of the mine, and
there are fears that the waste water
from the plant, impregnated with prus- j
sic acid,. are poisoning the water in the
reservoir. At the present time the city
does not draw upon this supply, owing |
to the small quantity there, but ranch- j
ers along the flume line will be in great ,
danger if they follow their usual cus
tom and use the water for domestic ;
purposes.
City Physician Stockton yesterday j
received. a gallon of water from the
reservoir, having sent for a sample, and
by analysis makes the startling discov- |
cry that .the water contains between j
sixty and sixty-five grains of prussic j
acid. A few drops would be sufficient
to kill a. human being.
Without wasting time in the matter ;
Dr. Stockton left for iyamaca this j
afternoon to ascertain whether the j
water from the cyanide plant is actu- j
ally running into thÂ« reservoir. He Is j
personally acquainted with the topog- j
raphy of the ground in the vicinity of |
the tailings and the reservoir and to
day lid that he does not see how waste
water from the plant can be kept from
running into the Cuyamaca reservoir.
':lt is a serious condition of things,"
said Dr. Stockton, "and I shall investi
gate it- thoroughly. If this deadly
poison is running into the reservoir an j
injunction will be asked for in r'ie
courts to prevent the flume coir.. j
disposing of any of the contents of me I
reservoir. Ranchers, I believe, get their j
domestic supply from Cuyamacaâ those j
li.-ing along the flume lineâ and their j
lives cannot be endangered. I cannot j
believe mat all the water in thÂ« reser
voir is as greatly Impregnated with
prussic acid as the gallon that was sent
to me, but only a small quantity is nec
essary to poison considerable water. I j
have notified the flume company that
I intend to investigate the conditions;
and the superintendent of the company-,
will accompany me to the reservoir to- i
night." = .

IS SHANGHAIED
WHILE AT CALLAO
Story of a Sailor From
the Battleship lowa. .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, .Wash.. March 30.â John
H. Abel, a young man about 22 years
of age, Is anxious to be placed under
arrest as a deserter. He alleges that
he has been a member of the battle
ship lowa's crew for four years and
that he was shanghaied at Callao,
Peru, in January last. He says that he
I has passed through the Santiago cam
paign on board the lowa, and met with
misfortune while the ship was making
the voyage from New York to San
Francisco.
Abel's story is to the effect that when
the lowa was at Callao. January .', he
and several of his mates had a forty
eight hours' shore leave. They imme
diately started in to enjoy the sights
and for a time drank deep of the pleas
ures of this Peruvian port. As is cus
tomary they finally ended up at a sail
or boarding-house. Here Abel says he
was given knockout drops in a drink
or whisky by the keeper, whose sur
name is Aleck. He was relieved of all
of his possessions, and when he re
gained his senses found himself on
board the Italian bark Altcar. bound
for Vancouver, B. C.
For about two months Abel per
formed service on board the Altcar.
which arrived at Vancouver March 4.
\t that port the kidnaped Bailor, in
company with several of the crew, left
the bark because the captain refused
to pay them money until they returned
to Callao. Abel soon cut loose from his
companions and made his way across
the Canadian line into Northern Wash
ington. He secured work in a sawmill
at ming and wrote a letter to the
commander of the lowa, reciting the
story which he rehearsed at police
headquarters this afternoon. He re
ceived in reply a letter from Captain
Terry advising him to give himself up
as a deserter.
Abel then made his way to Seattle
arid consulted the police as to the pro-,
per method ot delivering himself, wish-.
ing to %f\. back to the battleship. He
was referred to Assistant Quartermas
ter W W Robinson and United States
District Attorney Gay, who will likely
communicate with the San Francisco
officials. _

Children.
â¢ "aa.
HARRISONVILLE. Mo, March 30.â
E. Bates Soper was hanged at 5:30 this
morning-. He refused to have a:.y
spiritual conEok-ri-. He fell a distance
of seven feet, breaking his neck and
dying without a struggle. The execu
tion was private, being witnessed by
only forty persons.
E. Bates Soper was one of the most
cruel and most unusual of murderers.
The crime for which he was executed
was the murder at their home at
Archie, near here, of his wife and two
daughters, the latter aged four ar. .
years respectively. The murder had
been deliberately planned and v..
volting. Soper ran a butcher shop,
day in April. lÂ»91. he announced that
hy had learned that there was a 'blind
or an illicit saloon in town and
that he could not live in a place so
wicked. He soid his shop and disap
peared. Four days later neighbors
broke into the Soper home and found
the mother and children dr-ad in bed.
The heads of all had been crushed with
an ax and blood and brains were every
had left a note saying
he could not properly support his fam
ily and he believed they would be better
off dead.
Soper went to Portland, Or., and,
taking the name of Prentice, married a
respectable widow. In April, 1897, he
deserted his second wife, taking their
two-year-old child with him. He after
ward killed the child, choking it into
insensibility. and burying' it alive/
Later Soper, under the name of
Homer Lee, leased and worked a small
fruit farm near Ashland,- Cad., where
he was captured June 11, 1897. After
being landed in jail here Soper con
fessed not only the killing of his wife
and two children in Missouri and his
chil-d in Oregon, but admitted the mur
der in 1880 of his father. According to
his own story, on the evening of the
last-named murder Soper started to at
tend a literary society. On the way he
met his father and shot and killed him.
Throwing his revolver away, he pro
ceeded to the society and took part in
the exercises as if nothing had hap
pened. â¢

JAPANESE SCHOONER
REACHES HONOLULU
Going Alter Sharks, the Vessel Is
Driven by Storms to a Port of â¢
Safety.
HONOLULU. March 21.â There arrived
here to-day, about two hours previous to
the departure of the Australia, th- .w- :
masted Japanese schooner Riusiu Maru,
Nakegave master, eighty-ore days from
Tokio and sixty-tour from Wake Island.
She put into this port in distress, having
had all her sails carried away, in an aw
ful gale near Wake Island. She was n.z
the mercy of the storm and was driven
along .for six days. At the end of this
time the weather abated and'some new
saiis -were made. With these the Klusiu
made Honolulu; where the captain intends
to have repairs made. ...,.-..:
The little forty-fon schooner went" to
Wake" Island after sharks, which abound
there. It is well known, of course, that
both Japanese and Chinese are very fond
of shaTk meat, and that very profitable
cruises are sometimes made. â¢
The Riusiu Marti is the first Japanese
schooner that has called at this port. She
has seventeen Japanese and â  four Euro- 1
peans aboard. Of the former three are
apprentices learning navigation. The
Riusl-u Mar is owned by a Japanese lieu?

-"The quarterly' meeting -of the Mer

of the Academy at Sciences building last
evening, presided over by President F. W.
Dohrmann". "â¢ A report. of the work of the
association for the past three months was
â¢ c ; read and approved and a brief statement
made by the president in regard to vari
ous projects which the association now
has in .hand. Mr. Dohrmann â  regretted
that the "efforts, of the board of directors
to. secure "rapid transit in some erf the
downtown streets had not been' success
ful, but he believed the object would be
achieved in the near future. He further
suggested, the advisability of inaugurat
ing a movement for placing underground
.of all overhead wires, as had- been done
in Boston.. New York and other cities' in
the East, and for a system of public con
veyances i.n the park. He referred to the
gift of Cla'us Spreckels of $60,000 for. the
CTecttpn of a music stand in the park and
to the movement inaugurated, by Mrs.
Hearst, having in view the general im
provement of the City, suggesting that
their example should be emulated by oth
â¢ er public-spirited citizens.
But the- most important matter taken
up was the action to be taken by the
association in regard to the request of
% the Board, of Supervisors for the' consid
eration:., and: opinion of the association'
upon- the ' various projects petitioned for
by improvement clubs and" others and
â¢what provisions should be made to meet
such needed improvements as- may be
indispensable, and whether . the funds
therefor should be raised. by the .issue of
bonds "or in the tax levy without refer
ence to. the dollar limit. The following'
. plan, prepared by the. directors .and sub
mitted for the consideration of the asso
. ciation, was unanimously adopted:
" â¢ Resolved, That we recommend to our

subject of an adequate sewerage system
should receive the first consideration, as
the city was sadly lacking in that respect,
and suggested the appointment of a com
mission, consisting of an expert from the
East and two local engineers, to draft a
complete system. Street improvements.
new Bchoolhouses and the extension of
.the park to Market street he regarded as
of the next in importance. He called at
tention to the fact that ' San Francisco
occupied the unique position of a city
without a debt. But if.it was without a
debt, it was also without improvements,
such as have made other cities models of !
beauty, and progressiveness. He favored I
bonding the city to secure funds to be ex

Organ.
Rumors have been current for some
weeks that San Francisco was to have
! a new morning newspaper and that it was
partly owned by D. M. Burns, who
"also ran" recently for the United States
Senatorship. The story went further to
the effect that the Post was to be trans
planted into the morning field, and was
thus to be made a more effective organ
I for the Southern Pacific and was to con
i tlnue the fight of Dan Burns for the Sen
| atorship. Charles M. Shortridge, who was
one of the stanchest supporters of the
Mexican throughout his disgraceful can
didacy, was mentioned as the man who
[ was to guide the destinies of the morn
ing journal.
It can be stated on the best of author

ment of YV. H. Mills. There was a group
of Burns' friends talking about the weak
ness shown by him. and it was generally
attributed to the fact that he had no
paper of influence supporting his candi
dacy. Some one suggested that as Burns
was reputed to be a millionaire he should
buy the I'ost, convert it into a morning
paper and thus place himself in a posi
tion to get his views before the people.
Incidentally Shortridge was named as the
probable editor of the new morning jour

swallowed the bait, and that in all prob
ability the whole story was started to be
passed to the Senator from Santa Clara

TO MAKE NO DEFENSE.
I Mrs. Adams' Attorneys Will Not Ex
, pose Their Hand Now.
Mrs. Minnie Adams, accused of having
poisoned her two-year-old son, will
probably be held for trial before the Su
perior Court by Acting Police Judge Bar
ry to-day. The prosecution has about
completed its case, and the attorneys for
the woman have decided to offer no de
fense at this time. They argue that a
committing magistrate would hardly ac
cept the responsibility of dismissing a
murder charge in any case, and to expose
their line of defense at tfiis time would
merely give the prosecution an opportun
ity to take advantage of them. For tnat
reason they will abide their time until
the case comes up for regular trial.
Police Sergeant Duke concluded his tes
timony yesterday, and Identified the
boards removed from the floor of the
outhouse, which he said were saturated
with something that smelled like car
bolic acid. Defendant had told him that
she had used no acid and did not have
any in the house. She accounted for the
moist spot on the boards by saying that
the dead child had caused it shortly be
fore noon. It was then after 8 o'clock
at night.
Frank T. Green, chemist for the Board
of Health, testified that he had made an
analysis of the saturated portions of the
boards, as well as a piece of newspaper
found in the place, and found that car
bolic acid had been spilled on them.
Detective Graham gave practically the
same testimony as that given by Ser
geant Duke. Ho was still on the stand
when the hearing was continued until
to-day.
PUNISHMENT FOR SCORCHERS
The Golden Gate Park Commissioners
are determined that the pernicious habit
of scorching on bicycles in the city's
pleasure ground must stop. Coasting will
also be vigorously suppressed. Orders
have been issued by the Commissioners
to this effect, and they will adopt meas
ures to see that they are rigidly enforced.
The park police have received instruc
tions to arrest offenders and will be on
the alert for their game. These steps
â¢were obliged to be taken on account of
the many serious accidents caused by
reckless riders, who have apparently no
regard for life when they mount their
machines. The municipal authorities re
cently took the matter in hand, with
good effect, and the park authorities pro
pose to work on the same lines.

POLICE AFTER THE SWINDLER
REPRESENTED HE WAS A SOLIC
ITOR FOR THE RAILROAD.
Obtained Money for Inserting a Steel
Engraving in a Book En
titled "West of the
Rockies/
John H. Jewett, ex-president of the So
ciery of California Pioneers and president
of the Marysville Bank, has for the sec
ond time within a few months been the
victim of confidence men who have played '
upon his well-known generosity.
Yesterday he called at police headquart
ers and reported that he had been swln- j
died out of $65 by a man representing him- i
self as a solicitor for the Southern Pa- j
cific Company to obtain subscriptions or \
photographs of public men for a book j
they were to publish entitled "West of
the Rockies."
"The man. who gave his name as E. N.
Baker," said Mr. Jewett. "called at my
house, 931 Pine street, yesterday morning
and represented that Claus Spreckels, i
Colonel Hager and other prominent men
had subscribed for the book, which would j
contain steel engravings of prominent j
men only. Articles were to be written
by Mr. Spreckels and other leading men j
on subjects pertaining to California and
the book was to be circulated free in
hotels, railroad depots and other places.
He asked me to agTee to have a steel
engraving inserted in the book, which j
would cost $65, and believing in his rep- i
resentations I gave him the money and j
my photograph.
"I happened to meet Colonel Hager this
morning and mentioned the book to him.
He said the man had come to him, but he i
had refused to have anything to do with I
the book. I then made inquiry and dis
covered that the representations made by
Baker were false. I am afraid the fel- i
low will go around showing my photo- !
graph and get others to pay him $65 in
the same way."
Last July a man called upon Mr. Jewett
and represented that he had been sent
by the Republican State Central Commit
tee to ask him if he would receive a com
mittee of Republicans who desired to ten- i
dor him the nomination for the head of j
the ticket. Mr. Jewett declined the honor
and then the man presented a donation
list and asked him to subscribe to the
campaign fund. He looked over the paper j
and saw the names of Postmaster Mon- !
tague and others, who had apparently
subscribed sums from $10 to $20, and he |
gave the man $10. The man was profuse
in his thanks and as he left said that j
the committee would soon wait on Mr. |
Jowett. That was the last he saw or ]
heard of the man and a few days later
he discovered that the man was a fraud. |

GATHERING OF
THE OUTSIDERS
AT OAKLAND
David Tenny the One
Winning Choice.
KITTY KELLY TOOK THE STAKE
LOMOND PROVED A BIG DIS
APPOINTMENT.
Governor Sheehan Won at Odds of
40 to Iâ Sly Fancied the Weather.
David Tenny in Society
Again.
There is no gainsaying the fact that
the racing game is getting to be a diffi
cult one to beat as "get-away" day draws
near. The races at Oakland yesterday
were a veritable potpourri of wonders;
too deep for the strongest minds to de
cipher. Bullman made Ills reappearance
in the saddle and received a mild ova
tion, for the riding talent is badâ very
bad. He accepted but two mounts, and
on both occasions was returned a winner.
Game David Tenny was the lone equine
hero, the only winning favorite.
Not many days ago Ivy Powell rode
Governor Sheehan in a race, took his
time and ran unplaced. His odds on that
occasion were not loose. Yesterday, in
the opening sprint over the Futurity
course. \V. Narvaes, who has not piloted
a winner since the ice broke up in the
lake, sat astride the Governor, and at
odds of 40 to 1 won easily. So much for
the caprices of racing.. Roadwarmer
rated favorite, and was beaten for the
place by Polish, after showing in front
for many rods.
The invulnerable Sly, the wizard mare
of the Hanlon string, took the spin over
the Futurity course that followed. The
price, 6 to 1, was rather refreshing, and
Bullman got her to the wire a head be
fore February. Harry Thoburn, meekly
ridden by Ruiz, secured show honors.
Johnny Reiff captured the mile and a
sixteenth run. with Robert Bonner, an 8
to 1 shot. Ezell's horse was a real live
one, and taking the lead in the stretch
disposed of The Fretter in the mix-up by
a head. The latter should have won, but
was ridden by the idiotic McNichols.
Vincitor had his odds pounded down from
8 to 4, and ran like an artillery horse.
The General Arthur stake for two-year
olds proved easy for Kitty Kelly. Lo
mond, with Thorpe in the saddle, had
first call in the betting, but ran disap
pointingly. Kitty Kelly led Loch Katrine
past the judges with considerable to
snare. The winner was 3 to 1 in the bet
ting.
The long price of even money was
chalked against David Tenny winning the
mile and a furlong run. He collared Mnr
inel at the head of the stretch, beating
her out like breaking sticks.
The free handicap, at a mile, went to
Rosormonde. Bullman had her in front
from the start, and driving hard at the

The office of the California Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has
been moved from 211 Powell street to room
306, third floor of the Parrott building. It
was decided some time ago that the old
location was a little too far from the cen
ter of the business part of the city. It is
believed that the change will be very
beneficial to the society. The new quar
ters are sunny and attractive.

Floyd A. McFarland of San Jose and
Orlando L. Stevens of lowa, with their
trainers, James McFarland and Ed Juth,

the two first named will go into active
training for the coming season on the

given up racing is in a fair way to head
the list of American riders.

East about the middle of April. Downing
is going to Louisvile. while Ziegler and
Gibson, with Ward, go to Cincinnati.
Downing writes that the San Jose track

The San Leandro electric road made an
announcement yesterday which will pleas*
all wheelmen who have occasion to cress
the bay. Commencing at once, bicycles
will be carried free on all cars of the
company. Heretofore the charge has been
equal to the fare of, a person, which to
Haywards is 25 cents, so that the saving
to the riders who patronize the roads is
considerable. The change was brought
about through the efforts of President
Paul M. Nippert of the Asociated Club.-,
and the broad policy of the company is
again evidenced.
The postponed road race of the Bay City

MISPLACED SELF-LAUDATION.
OUR esteemed contemporary, the Examiner,
ratulates us upon furnishing it with evi
dence that in the last campaign some of its
partisan predictions were founded upon facts. It
claims that it warned us against the Board of Super
visors, the Railroad Commission, Dan Burns and the
Legislature, and it now alleges that although its as
sertions were discounted by the people at the ballot
boxes, they have all turned out to be true. It construes
some recent criticisms in The Call. as confessions of
error, and it only regrets that we did not see fit to
join with it at the last election "in preventing the
election of the scoundrels" we now- condemn.
This is all very well, but it is what our esteemed
railroad contemporary, the Evening Post, would call
"tommyrot." Suppose we had united with .the Ex
aminer at the last election in opposing the success of
the entire Republican ticket, State and city, and sup
pose we had succeeded in electing the .entire Demo
cratic ticket, what would have been the result?
Would we have obtained a better government at the
hands of the Phelan-McNab combine, than we ob
tained at the hands of the same combine two years
We beg to remind our contemporary that in
1896, when the people adopted its programme, the
Examiner imposed upon us the worst Supervisors and
School Directors ever known in the history of San
Francisco. A majority of the Board of Education
were downright thieves, and if justice had been done
every one of them would now be wearing stripes.
.Mayor Phelan himself, in order to save his repu
â n, was compelled to institute proceedings for
ousting the Board of Supervisors. As a matter of
fact, that choice band of Democratic boodlers was
thrown out of the City Hall by a body of policemen
and only regained power through a decision of the
Supreme Court, which held that the Mayor had
adopted the wrong method of suppressing them.'
At no stage of the game did anybody defend that
Board of Supervisors, and we have never heard a
word of praise outside the penitentiary for the Ex
aminer's School Directors. Of what avail would it
have been in the last campaign to follow the counsel
of a newspaper which brought such a government
upon the city only two years before? The present
administration .may not be the best we can get, but
it is a vast improvement upon the Phelan-McNab ad
ministration of 1897-98. In fact, we regard the Ex
aminer's self-laudation at this time as entirely mis
ed. It is buncombe and will not stand analysis.
1 government cannot be produced by giving the
oftices to the Phelan-McNab combine.
PESTHOUSE IMPROVEMENTS.
WITH commendable promptness the Super
visors have projected plans tor the improve
ment of the Pesthouse and rendering the con
dition of the inmates more comfortable. The plans
thus far outlined are not imposing, nor will they cost
much when carried oourt r but they promise the imme
diate attainment of the desired object of relief.
Superintendent Thompson, who has had charge of
the construction of the Hall of Justice, and who has
been in consultation with the committee of the Board
of Supervisors having the subject in charge,' is re
ported to have advised the total destruction of the
present dilapidated structure by fire and the construc
tion of a smaller building at a cost, not to exceed
$1000. It is believed that such a building will be ;
ample for the needs of the institution and that it will
afford the afflicted shelter and warmth.
If ior so small a sum as that the evil plight of the
inmates of the Pesthouse can be freed from the dis
.comforts of their present quarters, there can be no
; excuse whatever for delay in performing the work.
â ould be undertaken at once.
â¢ While the plan suggested has been favorably con
sidered, it has not yet been adopted by the committee.
It is expected, however, that a definite plan of im
provement will be reported to the Supervisors at the
meeting next Monday, and in the meantime the com
mittee is to make a careful examination of the whole
subject The prospects, therefore, are that within a
comparatively short time the unfortunates of the city
who are afflicted with pestilential diseases will have
for their abode a true hospital and not a damp,
moldy barrack swept by the winds and dripping with
moisture in every rainstorm.
Whatever is to be done must be done quickly. Nor
should there be too much haggling over the matter
of cost. In any event it need not be an expensive
undertaking, and every instinct of humanity calls for
its accomplishment.
This country will mourn with J. Pierpont Morgan
the loss of a $4000 collie, particularly as the next busi
ness combination made by Morgan will force the
country to pay for that purp.
THE DROUGHT APPROPRIATION.
LAST December it became public that the people
of a considerable section of two counties in this
State were so enfeebled in their resources by
the drought that they were unable to iced and carry
their livestock over to seeding time, were without re
sources for procuring seed grain, and in many in
stances were pinched in their supply of the neces
saries of life. The extent of the emergency has since
been measured in the closing of banks in the towns
to which the stricken region is tributary, because
there was no business for them, and their assets could j
not be realized on because of the prevailing lack of
resources among the people.
When this emergency appeared at the close of last
year it was seen to involve the interests of the public
and the State to such an extent that public action was
immediately required to relieve the distress and miti
gate to the minimum the harm to the reputation of
the State, which must come by the spreading abroad
of exaggerated and sensational reports.
California is the second State of the Union in area,
and the first in the variety of its soil, climate and re
sources. The district affected by drought in Monterey
and San Luis Ãbispo counties bears the same relation
and proportion to the rest of the State that a county
in New jersey does to the whole area of the Middle
5. But abroad the news of that limited and local
...â -.â¢ presents to the minds of men all California
scorched and feared by drought beyond the possibil
ity of self-support of her people.
Aware of this, the mercantile organizations of this
city and the State Board of Trade at once took meas
ures to ascertain all the facts, to make public the
boundaries of the troubled district and the conditions
therein which had caused the only real distress that
followed the drought.
The Examiner had already commenced exploiting
the matter as a newspaper sensation, and had by sub
scription raised a small sum of money, of which it
constituted itself the almoner, and with its "commis
sioners," artists, reporters, and wagons with its ad
vertisements printed on them, was entering upon a
winter's campaign of newspaper sensation which
all thoughtful men saw would inflict the i
maximum of damage upon the State while |
affording the minimum of relief to those who j
needed it. To avert this, and to carry the smitten peo
ple over to a more propitious season, was the problem
which confronted the State. The Governor of the
State, being without available pubiic funds for the
purpose, sought some quarter in which an advance
of the funds necessary could be secured, upon the as
surance that the Legislature, soon to be in session,
would refund the money and appropriate as much
more a* might be found necessary to carry en the
relief work until a better season made the needy peo
ple again self-supporting.
Upon application to Air. Claus Spreckels the Gov
ernor was offered by that gentleman a check for
$50,000 to be used in supplying forage for ranch
stock, food for the people and grain for seeding. It
was determined that half that sum would do the work,
and Mr. Spreckels therefore advanced $25,000. This
sum was put in the hands of Mayor Phelan. Mr.
Dohrmann of the Merchants' Association and Mr. A.
L. Spreckels, as commissioners, to apply it to the pur
poses for which it was advanced.
The case was not without precedents. Twice in_
public emergencies which the State had no funds to
meet the late Mr. Charles Crocker advanced the
money, on one occasion in the large sum of $75,000,
and in both cases was duly reimbursed by an appro
priation made by the Legislature. These precedents
â  made it clear that- the- Governor could solicit and the
State receive advances of money in emergencies, and
that the Legislature could recoup the party making
the advance.
The cash advanced by Mr. Spreckels was imme
diately devoted to the purpose for which it was in
tended. The office machinery of the Merchants' As
sociation was used in the orderly transaction of the
business, without cost to the fund distributed, and in
due time a bill was introduced in the Legislature by
the representative of the aided district for the return
of the money to Mr. Spreckels, and was passed in
both houses without a dissenting vote.
As this bill remained in the Governor's hands, after
adjournment, without action, Mr. Dohrmann, presi
dent of the commission to distribute the fund, made
inquiry of Governor Gage as to his intentions con
cerning it, informing him that there was a balance of
the money advanced by Mr. Spreckels on hand, to
the amount of about $12,000, the use of which was
necessary to continue the relief work, but that its de
votion to that purpose would be optional with Mr.
Spreckels if the appropriation failed to receive the
Governor's signature. To this the Governor made
answer by way of inquiry, asking: "Did not the
Examiner donate $5000 to the same relief work and
did not Mr. Spreckels Jbnate thereto this $25,000, and
was not a picture of the check printed in The Call,
and did not this paper publish abroad compliments
to the philanthropy of Mr. Spreckels?"
To this Mr. Dohrmann answered with a statement
of the facts, as above narrated, md thereafter the
Governor withheld his signature from the bill, as he
states upon constitutional grounds, ; .id the appropri
ation therefore was killed.
If the Governor's objection was constitutional, it is
unfortunate that he put it on other grounds in his
communication to Mr. Dohrmann, for the letter
answered only the objection made by the Governor,
to wit. that the money was a philanthropic donation
by Mr. Spreckels, and demonstrated that it was an
advance made to the State, to meet an emergency, at
the request of Governor Budd. Had Governor Gage
put his objection upon constitutional grounds in the
first place, the Relief Commission would have sub
mitted an argument in answer thereto. But as the
matter stands Governor Gage objected to the appro
priation on one ground and killed it on one entirely
different, to which he' permitted no argument nor ex
planation.
It appears, therefore, that the emergency for which
the money was advanced by Mr. Spreckels existed,
that the Legislature has adjourned and the Governor
has defeated a measure intended by it to meet that
emergency, and that it is left to be met solely out
of the private funds of Mr. Spreckels, at his option.
The people in the district affected cannot pay their
taxes, cannot buy grain for seeding a crop, cannot
carry themselves over to the harvest without help, but,
as far as the State is concerned, the Governor has left
them and their livestock to starve and their fields to
go untilled and unplanted.
Similar emergencies are not unknown in other
States. Only recently they have been met in
Nebraska and elsewhere by aid extended out of the
public funds by the State. They may arise here
again, and if the constitution prevent the extension of
that aid by the State, it should be known now. To
this end it is only reasonable to expect that Governor '
Gage will make public his interpretation of the con
stitution which caused him to kill this appropriation.
If it turn out that the constitutional objection is un
tenable a bad precedent has been established.
When Mr. Spreckels was informed of the Gov
ernor's action Mr. Dohrmann told him that, in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 31, 1899*
deference to the self-respect of the fanners to whom
relief had been given, they had been permitted to give
the Relief Commission their notes. Mr. Spreckels
then instructed him to return these notes to their
signers with his compliments, and there, so far as he
is concerned, the incident closed. But as concerns
the State it is not closed. Future emergencies will
arise and citizens will be again called on to assume
burdens for which the State is unprepared. Whether
they will do this in the prospect of the State's repu
diation of responsibility the future must disclose. The
correspondence in the matter and the facts concerning
it will be found in our news columns, and the facts as
i to the Governor's action are thereby submitted to
l public judgment.
THE SAMOAN CRISIS.
BEYOND a doubt the Samoan Islands are pro
ductive and the islanders are busy producers,
but of late years the soil and the people to
gether, under the stimulating influence of the aggre
gated governmental energies and science of the
United States. Great Britain and Germany, have
raised more Cain than sugar, and the crisis crop has
been bigger and more frequent than the cocoanut
crop.
There is not the slightest danger of a war growing
out of the imbroglio, tor it is too much like the com
plication of a comic opera to be taken seriously even
by diplomatist?, but it has already reached a develop
ment which has called for the roaring of big guns and
caused a considerable number of deaths. Silly as the
quarrel may be, it is clearly time to put a stop to it.
The affair has gone beyond the domain of talk, and
sonic action must be taken to restore order and pro
tect life and property.
As the situation stands the German representative
in the islands is in the wrong, and it is not likely
his Government will sustain him. Of the three
powers equally vested with authority in the islands
and bound by agreement to act in harmony, two have
supported the government of young Malietoa, and
moreover the Supreme Court established by the
powers has confirmed the title of that government.
Such being the case, it is the duty of the German
representative at Apia to obey the court and leave
to the Berlin Government the duty of making any
protests which German interests require to be made.
By acting as they have done the Germans have
stirred up a strife which has forced the American
and the British warships to fire upon the natives,
the German warship in the port remaining an inac
tive spectator and giving no help whatever to en
force the law. It is evident such a situation is intol
erable. It cannot be "long now before the tripartite
government is abolished. Either the islands will be
divided or it will be determined which power is going
to rule theni.
THE CEMETERY QUESTION.
THE cemetery question in this city will never be
settled until the Board of Supervisors passes an
ordinance forbidding further burials within the
corporation limits. There are practically no argu
ments against the enactment of such a law. The only
persons who have appeared so far in opposition are
â those whose financial or other interests impel them
to take issue with the promoters of the closing move
ment in the Western Addition.
This matter will come before the Health and Po
lice Committee of the Supervisors this morning, when
the old straw will be once more threshed over. The
ordinance pending before that committee changes
the boundary line within which further burials are
permitted after 1902 in such a way as to virtually
close the present cemeteries. This ordinance has been
indorsed by the Western Addition and Richmond
improvement clubs and is advocated by the Mission
Federation of Improvement Clubs.
The necessity for the passage of such an ordinance
is that no matter what progress cremation makes, it
is certain that burying will be the practice for many
years to come. Therefore cemeteries should be lo
cated a long distance away from the habitations of
the living.
While there is a dispute as to whether burying
grounds propagate disease, it cannot be claimed that
they are health resorts. Decaying bodies cannot pos
sibly improve the soil nor increase the purity of the
air. The Supervisors possess the power to forbid
burials, for cemeteries are subject to police control.
The Western Addition cemeteries are an injury to
that portion of the city, and their closing is demanded
by every consideration of the present and future wel
fare of the city.' The old City Cemetery and Italian
Cemetery were closed by the last Board of Super
visors, and the same action should be taken with re
spect to the remaining cemeteries. The Committee
on Health and Police should give this subject earnest
consideration and decide it in such a manner as will
satisfy the people generally, who, we think, are in
favor of closing.
There is hardly a doubt that the story of a plot
against the Czar, wherein his mother is a central

would never subject her son to the embarrassment of
having to send her to Siberia.

State and Local Mining Interests
Expect to Be Able to Raise
the Balance From Other
Sources.
The San Francisco Miners' Association
and other wealthy Interests of this city
Intend to make a determined effort to
induce the Board of Supervisors to set
an appropriation of J50.000 to be
used in sending and maintaining at the
Paris Exposition a suitable mlninj
hibit. The miners of the city and State
are very much disappointed over the
State appropriation of only (120.000, which
must cover the cost and maintenance of
the entire exhibit of the different produc
tive Interests of the State.
Only $25,000 of this sum was set aside by
the Legislature to defray the expenses of
the mining exhibit. Those interested in
the mining resources of the State feel
that the above mentioned sum is wholly
insufficient for a creditable exhibit of Cali
fornia's vast mining resources, and they
intend to raise at least $100,000 more, mak
ing the total amount to be spent in Cali
fornia^ exhibit at the Paris Exposition
$225,000. â¢
if they can Induce the Hoard of Super
visors to appropriate J50.000 tor this pur
pose the miners fe< i certain that they can
easily raise $JO,O'JO more from other
sources throughout the State.
Jt is feared that the mining interests of
the Stale wiil Buffer Irreparable injury if
they are not properly exhibited at the
Parts Exposition. If t .hey are successful
in raising the money the San Francisco
Miners' Association and the California
Mining Association will probably
suggest that the exhibit be placed in the
hands of reliable men chosen by the com
mercial interests of the State and city.
This will in' done to obviate the possibility
of the exhibit and money appropriated to
make it a success being placed in the
hands of politicians.
When seen yesterday afternoon Julian
Sonntag, president of the San Francisco
Miners' Association, pointed out many
reasons why the mining interests would
be injured by not being properly exhib
ited at the exposition. Mr. Sonntag ad
mitted that the miner.- were greatly dis
turbed by the prospi d of only sending
v exhibit to France. He said:
"There Is absolutely no doubt that such
a picayunish exhibit) in of our vast min
ing resources will work a great Injury to
California's reputation as a mining State.
"It will not only Injure the State in
that direction, hut the people will feel it
here at home. During the next two yeara
the output of our mine:-; should be at
least $20,000,000 more than it lias been for
tin last two years. The winters of '97
and 'ys were exceptionally dry seasons
and the mining interests of California
w<re considerably affected by drought.
This year, however, the State has bet â¢;
blessed with its usual downfall of rain
and the mining; industry will show a
healthy increase.
"If our exhibit Is properly handled, with
these favorable circumstances an influx
of foreign capital to California will re
sult. Prosperity throughout the State
means prosperity in this city. San Fran
cisco is to the Pacific Coast what New
York is to the Atlantic Coast. If our
mines are running full blast and our
miners receiving good wages these
healthy conditions in the interior reflect
on the commercial mirror of San Fran
cisco.
"The merchant feels it, the insurance
man feels it, the laborer feels itâ in fact,
all branches of commercial life are ef
fected by the prosperity. These are state
menta that should be thought of sen
ously by the members of the Board oi
Supervisors when the miners appear be
fore them to request the appropriation.
California's ground has not been mined.
It has only been scraped. Mines of wealth
untold slumber in its bosom, needing
nothing but capital and energy to make
them yield their Btores.
"I was East last October and Novem
ber and I talked with a large number of
people about the resources and general
conditions existing in California. I can
safely say that the people of this State
are ignorant of its resources, importance
and possibilities. Eastern folk look with
jealous eyes on California. They. realize
that this country out here is a serious
competitor. The West will some day sup.
plant the East in importance. It is slow
ly doing that now.
'â Look at the fate of Massachusetts.
Before the war she was the great cot
ton manufacturing State. Now that In
dustry has been transposed to the South.
These are things that the people of our
State should consider. California has the
natural advantages. Look at 'our water
power, our climate, our soil and oui
mines. These natural advantages should
be consplculously displayed to the eyes
of the world at every opportunity. Ad
vertising of this kind induces an influx ot
capital. A creditable exhibit of our min
ing industry at the Paris Exposition
means all these things and more, too. It
means prosperity all over the State from
one end of it to the other."

tives of the Merchants' Association to
meet the committee in joint conference.
| This will be held in the rooms of the
board next Wednesday afternoon at 2
o'clock. The outcome of this discussion
will determine the Supervisors as to their
report to the board.
Julius Sonntag and Edgar Painter, rep
resenting the North Central Improvement
Association, made an earnest plea for
I improved streets in the business section
of the city bounded by Market and Kear
ny streets and the bay. On behalf of the
improvement association the offer was
made that if the city would pay half the
expense- of placing the streets in repair
property-owners would pay the balance.
The entire cost was estimated at 5100,000.
It was held that property values and rents
had been reduced one-half in recent years
and that the city was a loser thereby in
a lower amount of taxes being paid.
As others have pointed out recently,
Mr. Sonntag said shipping and commer
cial interests were improving and a boom
was sure to reach the city shortly. This
would bring into use buildings and ware
houses for which no tenants can now be
found. It was granted that the outlying
districts had claims on the Supervisors,
but it was also pointed out that the bulk
of taxable property is in the heart of the
city and its requirements should have first
call on the attention of those in authority.
Chairman Aigeltinger explained that the
next tax levy would fall $1,250,000 short of
the requirements of the city. He did not
see his way clear to give the asked for
relief in pledging the board to provide for
this work in the forthcoming tax levy.
The request of the Market-street Rail
way Company for a franchise to run cars
propelled by electricity over certain down
town streets was again considered. Rep
resentatives of the company had riled two
petitions with the board, and as they
were at variance one with the other no
definite action was taken. The committee
could not determine whether the officers
of the company wished to run their cars
down Post street to Montgomery or to
Grant avenue, thence to Bush street and
thence to Montgomery.
An amended application will be re
quested. The committee will report in
favor of either of these routes, but will
not grant a franchise for a road on any
portion of Geary street over which it was
originally intended it should pass.
UNDERGROUND WIRES
IN THIS CITY SOON
MERCHANTS WORKING FOR A
CONDUIT SYSTEM.
For several weeks past the officers of
the Merchants' Association have been
considering- the proposition of the re
moval of ail overhead electric light,
telephone, telegraph and other wires
from the poles and substituting some sort
of underground system. The organiza
tion took up this subject a year ago and
a meeting was held in the offlca of the
Mayor. After discussing the disadvantages
of the present system and the advan
tages of having all wires laid in conduits,
those who attended the meeting agreed
that the change should be made as toon
as possible, in order that San Francisco
might keep pace with the up-to-date
cities of the United States. At that time
no further move toward the change was
made on account of the lack of informa
tion, but the association agreed to fur
nish the data as speedily as possible.
President Dohrmann made a visit to
Europe and upon his return to America
he was joined in New York by J. M.
King, superintendent of the association,
who was sent East to gather informa
tion relating to modern municipal im
provements. Together they inspected all
of the underground systems for wires,
etc., in the larger citt^, and upon their
return the associate requested of Mr.
King a report. The reason for this was
the determination to again agitate the
laying of wires of all kinds underground
and thus remove- one of the greatest
menaces to life and property in San
Francisco. The report has been pre
sented and shows the systems in use in
New York, Philadelphia and Boston. The
latter city, with its conduit system, has
been more successful than the other*.
The city was laid out in districts and
as fast as one locality was complete an
other was taken up, until in February,
1897, the conduits amounted to ninety-two
miles, carrying about 37,000 miles ci' wire.
During the past two years the work of
clearing the city of overhead wires has
been actively pushed. Of the conduits
used Mr. King says:
In the subways constructed, five different
systems of conduits were employed, viz: Sheet
Iron pipe lined with cement; plain wrought
iron pipe coated with asphalt or tar; vitri
fied clay; creosoted wood, and the Edison solid
tube system. Sheet iron pipe lined with
cement constituted the bulk of the conduits
laid. Creosoted wood was little used since
1894, and the greater portion of the Edison
solid tube system was laid previous to that
time.
The information presented by Mr. King
has received much attention by the offl
cera of the association. One thing has
been decided and that is to follow the
example of Boston and district the busi
ness portion of the city and a part south
of Market street first, and not attempt
to make wholesale changes. A number
of conduits have already been laid by
light companies, and the advent of the
new electric light company, of which
Claus Spreckels is the president, is re
garded as an important factor in the
movement, as the wires of this company
will be placed underground. Within a
tYw weeks it is likely that a special
meeting will be called by the directors
to take active steps toward introducing
the underground wire system here.

SUES A GUEST

HOTEL PLEASANTON STIRRED
S. ROE'S VIOLENT TEMPER
CREATES TROUBLE.
Was Accidentally Locked in His
Room and Afterward Wreaked
Vengeance on a Weak
Woman.
If Charles S. Roe, a wealthy Chieagoan,
who was a guest at the Hotel Pleasanton
up to Wednesday night, could hear the
opinions expressed by the lady guests of
that fashionable caravansary he might
consider himself the brute he is charged
with being. According to the former, Mr.
Roe is a nasty, mean old thing, a brute,
a villain and other detestable things. For
tunately for Mr. Rie, these pleasant re
marks ha\e missed his ears, as he Is
speeding back to Chicago in an effort to
escape the service of a $50u0 lawsuit filed
against him yesterday by Miss Lizzie M.
Boyd, a chambermaid at the hotei, who
accuses him of severely beating her.
Through her attorneys, Messrs, Knight
and Hooper, the lady riled her action, al
leging that he unlawfully and brutally
beat her, much to her bodily pain and
suifering, and as a result she is confined
to her bed and will not be able to attend
to business for many weeks, and that she
has expended the sum of $200 in uoctor's
bills.
A pathetic story of a much injured
chambermaid and a violent man underlies,
the tiling of the suit. On Tuesday last
Miss Boyd, in the course of her employ
i ment, had occasion to enter Mr. Roe's
room. Believing him to be out she opened
the door and entered, but was surprised
I to see the defendant asleep on his couch.
fcihe deposited some clean towels on the
dresser and tiptoed out of the room for
i fear she might awaken Mr. Roe, whose
crankiness was known lo the servants j
or' iho hotel. Jn her excitement, through j
force of habit, she locked the sleeper in. i
When he attempted to leave some min
utes later nt was astonished to rind him
self a prisoner. He wan instantly thrown
Inio a frenzy and nearly broke the call
bell in an eftort to have himself released.
The "bellhop" came rushing down the
( hall with Ice water, hot water, a bill 01 I
fare and other necessaries usually ealleu ;
for by the guests. When he arrived out-
Bide Mr. Roe's apartments he was com*
manded on pain of Instant death to re- :
I lease Its inmate. The quaking bellboy
I rushed off after Miss Boyd and after some
! delay fouijd her. lie explained to her the
: Btate of affairs and she, remembering to â 
bei sorrow that she locked the door, tiur
: rledly tried to repair her mistake by un
! locking the door. Her apologies, although
j profuse, only drove Mr. Koe into a fur
ther frenzy, and forgetting her sex and
j his own gallantry he roughly caught her
! and threw her to the floor. Her screams at
tracted a male guest, who grabbed the j
Infuriated man before he could wreak |
further injury on the chambermaid. Mr.
Roe's anger passed immediately and he
tried to make ajxiends for his nasty ac- !
tion, but the maid would have none of it. ;
The shock to her nerves, the bump on :
1 her head and a slight injury to her back
necessitated her taking to her bed, where j
I she remains, being attended by a num- ;
, ber of physicians, whose bills she thinks
will aggregate J2UO.
Mr. Huu left the hotel the next day, not â 
caring to face his fellow guests who had '
heard of his action. Humor has It that
lit; is on his way East. Borne guests con
done Mr. Roe's iirutality by claiming that
he has been Buffering from nervousness
i during the past two weeks and, In fact, ;
I has been constantly attended by a physi- !
I cian; that when he found himself a pris
oner in his own room he thought the :
chambermaid was making sport of him,
and when he saw her his pent-up feel-
Ings gave way to an outburst of angei-.
They also say in his defense that as soon
as he recovered himself he tried to make
amends to the injured female, but she i
wuuld not listen to him.
Mr. Roe is said to be connected with a i
largo electric light company in the Windy
City, and has been out here to escape the
rigors of a cold winter.

HOW MARINE HELM
PLAYED THE PIANO
It Was hither a 1 rick Instrument or He
Used His Feet Instead of His
Fineers*
I KNOTTY problem was present-
A e<l to Judge Graham yesterday
f-\ as to whether a marine of the
â  â *- battleship lowa walked on the
ceyboard of a piano, thereby de
troying some of the strings, or
whether there was an electrical ap-
paratus inside that caused the keys
to fly out as the marine struck them
with his finger?.
Charles B. Helm and E. J. Tucker,
marines on the lowa, went into the
saloon of Mrs. Julia Conley, 706
Howard street, Wednesday night,
and after having a few drinks J-lelm,
who is a musician, was invited by
Mrs. Conley to play on the piano,
which was in a room in the rrar of
the saloon. The marines adjourned
to the room and Mrs. Conley, who
was in the bar, was startled by the
terrific noises that came from the
piano. She ran into the room and
discovered that several of the
strings were broken, and as Helm
refused to pay the damage she called
in Policemen McNamara and Cook
and Helm and Tucker were taken to
the City Prison, where a charge of
malicious mischief was booked
against them.
When the case camd up before
Judge Graham yesterday morning
Mrs. Conley testified that Helm
must have tried to play the piano
Southern Pacific, which brought It over
land, charged nothing for transporting it.
It is four years since the idea of erect
ing a monument to Goethe and Schiller
llrst received attention in San Francisco.
Funds were quickly raised and the work
of securing the monument was proceeded
with at once. It Is an exact copy of the
famous group that has stood In Weimar
for three-ciuarters of a century. Per
mission to make the copy was obtained
from the King of Saxony, and the cast
ing was done under the supervision of
one of the best sculptors In Berlin.
The monument will stand near the new
music stand to be erected by Claus
kels on the site of the old Midwinter
Fair, and its unveiling will be made a
great event. This, it is hoped, will be in
August next.

said Helm, when asked for his side
of the story. "When I struck the
keys with my fingers I could not
get any tone out of it, and then I
Btruck harder. First one key flew
out and then another and so it went
on till in fear I stopped. I think
there must have been an electrical
machine in the piano, as the keys
flew out just as if they had been
charged with electricity."
Attorney Gallagher made a .strong
plea for the dismissal of the case,
as the defendants had fought and
bled for their country while destroy
ing Cervera's fleet. Referring to
the piano he said that it must be
one of the trick instruments invent
ed for the purpose of Hying to
pieces at opportune moments.
The Judge did not believe in the
trick instrument argument and
asked Helm if he would pay for the
damage. He said he would and a
corporal who was in court promised
that he would see that the money
was paid. The case was dismissed
and Helm and Tucker left the court
room in charge of the corporal.
NEW TRILBIES
TWINKLE THEIR
FEET IN TUNE
A Dozen in a Bunch i
at the Chutes.
HYPNOTIZED THE AUDIENCE
AN AMATEUR NIGHT SPECIAL
CATCHES ON.
The Dancing Was Somewhat Weird,
but the Girlish Girlies Did Their
Best to Please the
; Crowd.
Double "Uncle Tom's Cabin" combina
tions may have to take a back seat. They
will probably not be "in it" longer with
the theater-going public since last night,
when a dozen Trilbies tripped on the
stage at the Chutes to paralyze the optic
nerves of an unusually demonstrative
"amateur night" audience.
They were an assorted lot of young
sters, showing none of the beefy pro-
portions of female professionals. Their
nether limbs, on the contrary, were in all
cases spindling and the display of toot-
Ble-wootsiea at the extremity of this un
derpinning was dazzling in its variety.
There were tall Trilbies with splay feet
and short Trilbies with hay feet. There
were Trilbies, judging from the way they
danced, whose feet were "nobular," with
O-*-Â« -â¢-+ -â¦-â¦-â¢-â¦-â¦-â¦-â¢-â¦-â¦-
the nobs cruelly prominent, and there
were yet other imitations of the victim of
the- baleful Svengall, whose feet were not
mates.
They were all a little awkward, as a
sure-enough Trilby should b<\ and me
audience was Inclined to guy them a hit.
but the whole dozen danced barefooted'
nnd barellmbed to the edges of thPir sol
dier coats, and smiled in unison and
â¢-â¦--s>-â¢- <Â§> -â¦-^ -â¦-â¦-â¦-â¢Â§>-â¦- â $>-â¦-â¢
seemed to enjoy it Immensely. What
they were dancing nobody knew and no
body dreamed of figuring out. Some
times, especially when Svengali's power
tickled the soles of the feet of the pret
tiest Trilby, who was also the highest
kicker, the suspicion dawned that they
weren't even dancing, and there are somo
people hardhearted enough to say inf.
suspicion v. as correct.
Hut whether or not they danced was
neither here nor there with the audience.
It had been satisfied earlier In the even-
ing crying down the voices of a dozen
aspiring amateur vocalists, despite the
plaintive sign, "Remember All Profes
sionals Were Amateurs Once." It was
content to keep still, especially when it
suld that the Trilbies only Intended
chaiming with their pedals. And so the
Trilbies continued for the space of ten
minutes to fill the air with spindling an
kks and pink feet until Svengali, who
was practically professional, thought he
had worked enough for once night and
blew the whistle on the job. Then the
Trilbies trotted off and their one night
of glory had faded.
SIR TATTON SYKES HERE.
British Nobleman Who Gained Un
enviable Notoriety.
As stated in yesterday's Call, Sir Tat
ton Sykes has arrived in this city from
Monterey and engaged apartments at the
Palace. He is accompanied by R. Chol
mondeley and H. Simpson. The party
registered from Mexico, where they were
sojourning previous to going to the
southern part of the State. Sir Tatton
Sykes has the appearance of having
aged to a marked degree since his vfartt
here four years ago, the result, no doubt,
of the divorce proceedings which he was
obliged to begin against his wife. She
it was who squandered his lordship's
wealth and involved him in all sorts of
difficulties by her extravagant habits.
He has been granted the decree of di
vorce and is now making a tour of the
world to enable him in a measure to
forget his sorrows. From here the party
will go to the Orient for a protracted
stay.
Lord Sykes is the possessor of one of
the richest estates in Yorkshire, England.
Some time ago he was sued by an Eng
lish money lender for Â£16.000 on notes
bearing his name. He refused to pay on
the ground that the signatures were for
geries and the suit developed the fact
that his wife caused the forgeries. It
created a tremendous sensation when
Lady Sykes on the witness stand ad
mitted having borrowed the money, and
that she had played it all away on the
races. She claimed that her husband
was so parsimonious that he would not
advance her money. Friends of the lady
nnally paid the debt.
MORNING STAR AT HONOLULU
Will Convey Missionaries to Islands
in Micronesia.
The missionary ship Morning Star,
which sailed from Snn Francisco on
March 3 for the islajids in Micronosia, is
expected to leave Honolulu about April 1.
At the latter place it took aboard Rev.
Philip A. de la Porte, wife and child, and
will take them to Pleasant Island, where
the clergyman has been laboring in mis
sionary work for a number of years. He
speaks the language of the natives and
has already succeeded in converting many
of them to* the cause of Christianity. On
his vacation, from which this is the re
turn, he married Miss Saline Schaeffer of
San Francisco, whom he met on the At
lantic en route fo,r Europe.
The Morning Star was to have sailed
some time last summer, but owing to the
recent war with Spain the American mis
sionary committee of Boston deemed it
best to delay lta departure until after
the danger was over. Captain Bray, the
commander, is accompanied by his wife
and children. Mi:?s Wilson is also aboard.
She goes as a teacher to one of the isl
ands. After the passengers are taken to
their destination and the lumber and
stores landed, the Morning Star will make
a cruise among the islands. Its future
home will be at Honolulu.
BURIED IN A SEWER.
Ban Sheehan Resurrected in the Nick
of Time to Save His Life.
Daniel Sheehan, a laborer, while en
gaged in digging a sewer on De Haro and
Twenty-third streets yesterday forenoon,
had the unpleasant experience of being
burred alive for a short time. Sheehan,
with others, who were empldyed by a
contractor in putting in a sewer at the
place mentioned, neglected to shore up
the sides of the excavated ditch. This
omission come very near costing Shee
han his life, as the embankment gave way
and buried him beneath its weight. His
fellow workmen hurried to his assistance
and succeeded in digging him out before
anything more serious occurred to him
than the unpleasant sensation of having
been shut out trom the land of the living
for a brief period. As soon as he was
taken out of his temporary grave he was
hurried off to the City and County Hospi
tal, where Dr. Roche examined him and
found nothing more serious than a badly
lacerated hand and arm. where some
rocks had crusheo against the limb.
After this little scare had passed over
the sides of the si.wcr received the neces
sary shoring up to prevent any further
casualties of a similar nature.
Anna Greenwood's Will.
The will of Mrs. Anna Greenwood, who
died March 11, leaving an estate valued
at $26,000, was fiied for probate yester
day. The testator bequeaths her entire
estate to her childrenâ Mary, Walter and
Jimmy Greenwoodâ share and share alik^.

NEW YORK MONEY MARKET.
Tb. circular of Henry Clews says:
â¢â¢Considerable money has come to New York i
from neighboring: cities in the last few days
and been out out on time loans. This has j
eased up call money to some extent, which has
had the effect of making holders of stocks
more tenacious in clinging to them; therefore,
forced sales have been less frequent, in con- |
sequence, than during last week. To-day's j
bank statement, however, is likely to be un- ;
favorable again, and the two following ones ;
will show but little improvement, from all in
dlcatlODS. This will doubtless cause, mean- j
trhile, the same caution which has existed dur- ;
ing the present month. Specialties, however, \
like sugar and other industrials, have moved ;
' up vigorously, irrespective of money condi- j
tions."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 30.â The movement In
stock prices to-day was very irregular, with
net changes mixed, but with losses slightly '
prevailing. Three stocks. Federal Steel, Brook
lyn Transit and Manhattan, figured for nearly
half the total sal*-.-? on the Exchange, which
â were not much below a million. Fears of
trouble over the Samoan situation gave a gen
erally easier tone to the early market, which
subsequently advanced under the leadership of
the Flower stocks and Manhattan and Sugar,
but later eased off again on the very high rate
for money, 12 per cent being charged before the |
close for call loans. The hanks early in the I
day advanced the call rate to 6 per cent. Many
brokers and traders had made early provision :
for loans, which carried them over until Mon- i
day. On the Stock Exchange the rate ad
vanced to 12 Â£ier cent and the last loan was ;
5%. The fluctuations were reflected in the
variable and nervous movements in many |
stocks. Washington advices that the Samoan
complications were not serious, together with !
the confident manipulation of come of the spe- !
cialties, were coincident with some of the high
est prices for the day for these stocks. Fed
eral Steel, on the largest dealings of any one
stock, advanced 7si, closing at the highest. The
preferred sympathetically rose 1%. Brooklyn
Transit, which has been very active and strong .
all week, closed practically unchanged, al- .
though at one time it was up 3 points and at
another as much below last nicht. People's :
Gas, another Flower stock, moved similarly, ;
but on less wide fluctuations, likewise closing !
about unchanged. There was no news attend
ing the movements in these properties, but a I
circumstar.ee which attracted much attention I
was the gradual troop of the railway stocks, !
which were affected by the stringent monetary :
situation and in a measure were also influ- j
enced by the divergence of active operations j
into the specialties. Rumors of a possible co
operative arrangement between Manhattan and
Metropolitan raised the former â '. 1 4 , the highest
quotation being at the close, and Metropolitan
1%. Third Avenue, too, rose 5 points, in ex
pectation that the company's interest would not :
suffer as much as anticipated by impending leg- j
islation.
Sugar retained 2'~ points of the 6 points rise I
coincident with the advance in the refining
article. Continental Tobacco made a fractional j
advance after a large recession in the early ;
trade. The market closed with a heavy un
dertone.
Ruslness In bonds fell off considerably to-day >
and me weak spots cropped out. The main
tendency of prices, however, was toward a
higher plane, with the Atchiscns and .St. Louis
Southwestern issues in good demand. Total j
ealef, J'J.nOO.C-00.
Government bonds were unchanged In bid
quotations.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 954,400

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 30.â For the first fifteen
minutes there was more wheat for sale than
the buyers could absorb. May opened a shade
lower at from 73>ic down to 73c, and rapidly
declined to 72% c. That proved the rallying
point. After May had worked gradually up to
73% c the market became heavily charged with
buying orders. That shot the price up to 74% c.
July meantime sold from 72% cto 74% c.
The easy opening was largely due to the
Price Current and the Thoman report falling
to confirm the crop damage claimed by country
correspondents of commission houses. Another
bearish factor was the rather reluctant re
sponse from Liverpool and New York to the
extreme bullishness prevailing here. Country
men from every point of the compass were
still filling the markets with damage reports,
sensational in magnitude. Reported shipments
of 2,576,000 bushels from Argentina for the
week encouraged the bears to Jump on the
market, rushing May wheat from 74% c down
to 72->s<s'72%e. and July from 74% c down to
72*, c. The crop condition could not be forgot
ten, however, and the market rallied strongly
again, closing with May bringing 73Â»ic sellers.
July lett off at 7:ic buyers.
Corn was dull with a weak undertone, but
any important decline was prevented by the
firmness of wheat. In view of the holiday to
morrow the crowd was inclined to even up.
May corn closed %c lower.
Oats were active with heavy buy>ng of July
by outsiders. That option was relatively
firmer than May and the spread was narrowed
Me to â¢â â Â«(â . The delay in seeding was the chief
bull Incentive. May closed a shade lower.
Packers had more for sale than the specula
tive trade wanted and provisions ruled heavy
and spiritless. Large hog receipts and a slow
cash demand had a depressing influence. May
pork declined 7%c, lard 2'/z@sc and ribs 5@7%c.

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
Hay is off again and weak at the decline.
Bran is lower, but Middlings are firm and in
light supply.
The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"We have a rather weak Hay market to re
port at the present time. Throughout the storm
of last week no auction sales were attempted
here in town, and contrary to the expectations
and wishes of consignees an average amount of
Hay kept coming to market dally. No Hay
could be handled because of the rain, and as
has always been our experience, consumers
would not even talk Hay until the weather
cleared. On Saturday last the storm broke and
a sale was held. The entire week's accumula
tion was offered for sale on that day, with the
result that prices dropped about $1 per ion
all around. Buyers knew of the amount of
Hay on the market, and in many Instances
dictated their own price on what had to be
unloaded. All this Is evidence that the farmers
realize the futility of holding their Hay for
the extreme prices of last spring. Having
come to this determination, they ail seem to
feel that they cannot dispose of their Hay
quickly enough. As we expressed ourselves last
week, this is an erroneous idea, especially when
stocks of Hay are low throughout the coun
try as they are at the present time.
"To keep our market properly supplied all
holders of Hay should send in their holdings
at Intervals so as to dispose of their lot; at
the end of the season, but not before. Receipts
for the past six days have been about 2400 tons,
a very heavy supply. Yesterday and to-day
we noted a fairly active demand, and our
opinion of the matter is that prices will go
no lower unless we have a recurrence of our
experience of last week, but that present prices
I or a little improvement on the present range
I will continue throughout the balance of the
season, providing shipments are regulated
properly."

i FARE 60Â«LEFT FOR THE
DECISION OF
HUNTINGTON
Will Act on the Grain
Rate Case.
SITUATION IS COMPLICATED
THE CO3IMISSIONEBS AT SEA
AMONG THEMSELVES.
An Interesting Session Promised,
With a Three-Cornered Contest
Between the Members in
Prospect.
-. ;â  i P. Huntington. president, and
General Thomas H. Hubbard, vice presl
.-:-:-.'. of the Southern Pacific Company,
Tv'il decide whether or not the suit of that
poration against the State Board of
Railroad Commissioners is to be dismissed
â  a compromise effected with the com
riiissioh en the basis of an 8 per cent re
daction in grain rates. This information
rcmes from an absolutely reliable source.
;â¢. was further stated that the present
>]!spositJon and policy of the railroad com
pany i* to fight the case to a conclusion
in the courts in its merits.
F>o;h the gentlemen named are due to
'arrive in this city early next week to take
; â .:! in the annual flection of directors
.-: the Southern Pacific Company, to be
14 Id on April 5. As the action of the Rail
: .-..; Commission will be largely depend
â¢ nt on that of the railroad company, the
;.-i;.Â»fr must make a definite move before
-.he 10th of April, the date lixed by the
i intmissioii for final action. If the rail
road should determine not to dismiss the
s-uit -rt-t I tie time, the position of the com
mission will be peculiar.
ÂAi its last meeting it decided to rescind
;he resolution, of the former commission
â  whkh involved it in the present litigation,
provided an S per cent reduction in grain
r&.tfcs were made by the railroad company.
.Vijt commission, in fact, conditioned one
pita upon another, and the precedent con
<:::ion is controlled by the Southern Pa
f.fic Company. If the latter does not take
stfej^s to have the injunction against the
commission dissolved, the commission will
be unable to make the proposed reduction
in grain rates, the resolution of the old
beard will have to stand and the pending
iiiigation necessarily be continued. These
are the expressed views of Commissioner
Laumeister, but they do not accord with
those of the two other Commissioners.
' Commissioner Blackstock believes that
the- commission of which he is a member
actually rescinded the resolution of the
old board, and thereby removed all cause
for litigation. His attitude was clearly
<-nui:eiated in an interview had with him
at. Los Angeles a few days ago. wherein
Jie. ; used the following language: "Our
â¢ ''hrd will meet in San Francisco on April
:,'. at which time all the litigation which
] a* for years been on between the board
ivn<l the Southern Pacific Company will
be formally ordered dismissed. "
, .-Blackstock's idea is that on the aban.
dantnent of the defense of the suit insti
tuted by the Southern Pacific Company
that corporation will make no contest
, ever the proposed reduction In grain
rates. If Blacfcstock'a plan Is carried out
.the costs of the pending suit will fall
â¢upon the people, while if the programme,
;as -understood by Laumeister, is put
the Southern Pacific will have to
â ft-and the costs.
â â¢" -Commissioner Edson has' the unusual
l : coarage to admit that he was bunkoed
r : when he was Induced to vote for the am
/bfguous resolution contrived by the joint
;-efforts of Blackstock and Laumeister,
= and at the forthcoming meeting he in
:. tends to repudiate that document.
.For these reasons the approaching
;."s>ssion of the commission promises to be
one of the most interesting in its his-
HARBORED BURGLARS.

JHE BEST STREAMS TO FISH
f rare not, I, to fish in seas.
Fresh rivers best my mind do please.
' Izaak Walton.
THEY'RE off! Anglers, no matter
where they may be, always hail the
first of April with delight.
Trout fishing is a fascinating pas
time, and much has been said and writ
ten from time to time in praise of the
art and charms of angling.
For weeks before the opening day the
experienced angler takes great pleas
ure In preparing his tackle; he sees that
his rod is varnished, his reel oiled and
his flies and spoons are replenished.
When the first of April arrives he
feels that he must don his fishing suit
and hie himself to his favorite stream,
and if it should be high and the pros
pects poor, he has at least the satisfac
tion of having had a pleasant outing.
Last Saturday a weekly sporting pa
per contained the following notice:
"We trust that anglers who fish on the
first will report their takes. A postal
card from each, designating the local
ity, files used, number and average size
of fish killed, etc., will enable us to
make a pleasant rod column the fol
lowing week."
Ask any angler a few days prior to
the opening day where he Intends fish
ing on the first, and his answer inva
riably will be, "I haven't made up my
mind yet."
All anglers are to a marked degree
selfish in this particular and are not
prone to tell any one the stream or
creek they intend fishing.
The angler, however* is a different be
ing on a stream, as he is generally lib
eral to a fault. W hen brothers of the
rod meet they usually first exchange
compliments, the flask then follows and
that means a toast to pleasure and suc
cess. Your newly formed acquaintance
may show you his catchâ that is. if he
has any fish worth showing; but you
will have to be very intimate before he
will tell you the location of the pool
or pools they had been taken from.
As a rule, the fly fisherman, so-called,
looks upon bait fishers with scorn, and
there are quite a number of "flymen"
who will tell yol without a smile that
they never used bait of any kind.
Suppose a fly fisherman is fishing
down stream and casts his fly in the
tail of a ripple and a beauty of say

two or three pounds rises to it, but
misses. As a rule the whipper will give
up in disgust after making a few in
effectual trials and pass on to the next
->00l or ripple. If he knew anything of
bait fishing he would remove the fly,
put on a No. 10 hook with a small piece
of fish as bait attached, drop It in the
pool and stand back the length of the
rod from the edge of the water, Keep
ing the bait In motion. The lure is al
most certain to be taken, and after a
sharp struggle the fish is landed. Plac
ing the beauty in his basket the prac
tical angler proceeds on his way, re
joicing in the fact that he knows a
little something about bait fishing.
A good mode of bait fishing a small
stream is to use only one hook and no
sinker. Attach the hook to a three
foot leader and with about twenty-five
or thirty feet of line out let the current
carry it downstream. If you are using
light tackle and should hook a fair-sized
fish, it will take considerable skill to
handle the prize successfully.
Of course, compared with fly or spoon
fishingâ to use a common expression
bait fishing "is not in it."
The angler who can handle a rod deft
ly and drop a fly on any desired spot at
from thirty-five to fifty feet distant can
be considered an artist in the full sense
of the word. -â¢-:--.. ; ...
The Sari Francisco Fly-casting Club of
this city can boast of quite a number
of such experts, viz: Walter D. Mans
field, H. C. Golcher, H. Battu. T. W.
Brotherston, G. C. Edwards. E. Ever
ett, A. E. Lovett, E. A. Mocker. H. F.
Muller, F. H. Reed. H. E. Skinner. A.
T. Vogelsang, C. G. Young, etc. In fact,
the president of the club, Walter D.
Mansfield, Is the long-distance cham
pion fly-caster of the world. There are
other members, however, following
closely in his footsteps, one being Harry
C. Golcher, who made a cast the other
day of 118:6 feet.
The San Francisco Fly-casting Club
Is an excellent school for the amateur,
as he will learn much of the art of fly
tasting if he will visit Stow Lake, in the
park grounds, on Saturday afternoon
or Sunday morning during the summer
months.
Quite a number of local creek-tramp
ers have in the last few years taken
kindly to spoon fishing. Such fishermen
as Al Wilson, Charles Precht, Del Coop
er, Charles Cate, H. Battu and Louis
Rondeau will tell you that it is equally
as good sport as fly fishing.
Now, then, for April Fool's day.
Should the weather be unfavorable for
an outing in the country, where flowers
and fishes abound, the exodus of an
BOLD DAYLIGHT ROBBERY
OF A BANK MESSENGER
THIEVES GET
AWAY WITH A
SACK OF COIN
They Secure $2500

in Gold.
Through the clever and successful op
eration of two bold thieves the Anglo-
Callfornlan Bank was yesterday robbed
of $2500. The crime was committed In
broad daylight and on one of the busy
thoroughfares of the city. It was evi
dently the result of a well laid plan, and
the police at a late hour last night were
working on the case without any indica
tions of success crowning their efforts.
During the morning the bank sent some
shipments of coin to the office of Wells,
Fargo & Co.'s express in the wagon of
the bank, which was driven by the regu
lar messenger of the institution, Joseph
N. Waters, who has been in the employ
of the bank for the last fifteen years.
When Waters was on Second street,
near the express office, which is at the
corner of Second and Mission streets, he
was accosted by a stranger and asked
the way to the Grand Hotel. He informed
the stranger and then drove on to his
destination. While unloading the vehicle
he discovered that a sack containing
$2500 in gold coin was missing. This is
the story told by Waters to P. N. Lilien
thal, the president of the bank, as soon as
he returned, which he did without loss of
time.' He believes that while he was talk
ing to the stranger a confederate of the
latter sneaked up in the rear of the
wagon and abstracted the sack of money.
The police were immediately informed
of the occurrence, but have no clew to
the thieves, except a description of the
man who stopped Waters to inquire the
wav to the Grand Hotel.
waters is an old man, who lives in
Oakland, and has always rendered faith
glers from the city will not be heavy,
but then there are among the fraternity
a class known as thoroughbreds, who
never miss wetting a line on the inau
gural day of the trout season. In fact,
the thoroughbreds would feel disgusted
and weary if. by some reason, they were
compelled to remain Indoors. Doubt
less the weather may not be suitable
for fishing to-day, still it is safe to say
that there will he quite a number of
rods seen on creeks that are within
easy reach of this city. The veteran
angler need not be informed as to the
most inviting streams, but the amateur
will look to The Call for information,
and for his special benefit the following
streams are recommended: San Pablo,
Wildcat, Redwood Canyon, Sausal, Cal
averas and Alameda. Wildcat Creek
clears rapidly. There are some nice
pools on Sausal Creek up in Diamond
Canyon. Follow the creek up from High
street' bridge, Alameda. The Calaveras
is an excellent stream: also the Ala
meda, but they will be somewhat late
this season on account of the recent
rains. However, they will probably be
in condition by May l.
Smiths Creek, in Santa Clara, is a
good early stream. The Guadaloupe Mine
Creek, Los Gatos, Saratoga and Ste
phens . creeks are all fine streams and
Within easy distance of Los Gatos.
There are quite a number of excellent
mountain streams in San Mateo County.
One of the best Is rtWe Purlsslma. Take
the train to San Mateo, stage to Span
ishtown, and .if you will notify Mrs.
Dougherty she will send a team for you,
or if you will take the morning train
the Mage will take you through. The
San Gregorio is another good stream.
The La Honda, another favorite. is on
the same road. Further south are the
Lobitos, Pompano. Pescadero and Clear
Creeks, all of which are excellent early
streams.
Boulder Creek. Bear Creek. Kings
Creek and the San Lorenzo River are
all excellent streams. The three former
are early waters. Good fishing can be
had on the San Lorenzo during the en
tiro season with either fly or spoon.
Benn's royal coachman is a killer on the
Lorenzo.
Sonoma Creek affords excellent sport
throughout the season. Fish up from
the town of Sonoma. There are several
small streams emptying into the Sono
ma, especially those In the vicinity of
Glen Ellen.
Latest reports from Hopland and Clo
verdale state that the creeks are in
good shape.
Salmon Creek and Mud Creek, in Ma
rin County, are good early streams. To
reach Salmon Creek take the North Pa
cific Coast over to Bodega roads; it is
ful service to his employers, and no sus
picion is said by them to attach to him.
FOR EASTERN GUESTS.
Reception in Honor of Prominent
Church Workers From Detroit.
The ladies of the deaconess" bureau of
the Women's Home Missionary Society
tendered a delightful reception to Mrs.
Jane Bancroft Robinson and her sister.

versation.
Mrs. J. R. Simms, president of the local
bureau, and Rev. J. X. Beard, dean of
the bureau, spoke words of welcome.
Mrs. Robinson, who is the organizer of
the deaconesses' movement in the United

Bflsfl Bancroft, field secretary, also had
much of interest to say.
THE CASE AGAINST
LIEUTENANT NEALL
FURTHER CHARGES CONCERN

They Relate to Deception and False

Is a Secret.
The court-martial formed to try Lieu
tenant Neall for his delinquencies or
ganized yesterday morning, hut pro
ceeded no further. The accused was not
even arraigned. The charges again.st
him were presented but were not read,
and as they had been somewhat altered
and other specifications had been added,
Crittenden Thornton, counsel for the ac
cused, asked for a continuance of a
week.
In making his request Mr. Thornton
called attention to the fact that he had
been only recently retained and he had
not had sufficient time to prepare him
self on the charges as originally served.
Just before the court convened, he said,
the charges had been amended and oth
era had been added, and he had been able

to give them only the most casual ex
amination. Two specifications had also
been added to the former list, he said,
one attempted and actual deception and
falsehood to lieutenant Floyd W. Har
ris, Fourth Cavalry, adjutant of the
post, in an official matter. The second
referred to the same offense committed
against Lieutenant T. H. Sladens. quar
termaster of the Fourth Cavalry. Mr.
Thornton also referred to the fact that
certain specifications alleged deception
against Colonel Charles E. Comptpn,
Fourth Cavalry, who is now in Hawaii,
and he said Lieutenant Neall was un
willing that the charges should be dis
missed or passed owing to the absence
of Colonel Compton or that they should
be investigated without Colonel Compton
being present to testify. If the postpone
ment should be granted he was sure the
case would then continue until the re
turn of Colonel Compton.
The room was closed, the court con
sidered the application, and then it was
announced that the time asked for had
been granted.
Every officer was in full dress uniform
when the court was called to order. ThÂ»
Judge Advocate. Captain Robert H.
Nobb, administered the oath to the pres
ident and members of the court, and
then the president administered the oath
to the Judge Advocate. The court was
composed of the following officers:
Lieutenant - Colonel Henry Wagner,
Fourth Cavalry, president: Major FVId,
Second Artillery; Major Guy L. Edie
brigade surgeon United States Volun
teers; Captain Sedgwlck Pratt, Third Ar
tillery; Captain Henry C. Danes, Third
Artillery; Captain Isaac P. Ware, assist
ant surgeon; Captain Frank Greene.
Signal Corps; First Lieutenant William
S. McNair, quartermaster Third Artil
k-ry.
Neall was asked if he had any objec
tions to any officer serving on the court,
and Mr. Thornton announced thnt thÂ«Â»
accused was satisfied. Then it was that
Thornton made his application for time,
and when it had been granted he asked
that Neall, who is now confined to his
quarters, be given the liberty of the post.
This was denied by the court, as the
president stated that such matters were
not within the court's jurisdiction. Then
an adjournment was taken until next
Thursday at 11 o'clock.
The request for more liberty was after
ward made to Colonel Wagner, as com
mandant of the post, and it will probably
be acted upon to-day.
Wlisma SHRDLU nnd when the man fro
Robs the Poor Boxes.
John Fitzpatrick, a tough old tramp,
w;is yesterday sent to the County Jail
for six months by Judge Mogan on a
charge of petty larceny. He was ar
rested at tho Paulist Church on Cali
fornia and Dupont streets, where he had
stolen silver candlesticks. The police
stated that the' old man systematically
robbed poor boxes and he admitted that
he had been arrested several times for
petty larceny and vagrancy.
For Stealing a Pig.
Charles Jackson, Robert Hansen and
John Linartinl, the three boys charged

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS
SEQUEL OF A
RACE TRACK
TOUT'S ARREST
Paul Kay Will Sue
the Sheriff.
RELEASED ON HABEAS CORPUS
RE WAS REARRESTED BEFORE
HE LEFT COURT.
Determined Effort of the District At
torney to Hold the Man Who
Stole Two Valueless
Pool Tickets.
Oakland Oriice San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March o".
Attorney L. < '. Pistoles! announced this
afternoon that he will sue Oscar L. Rog
ers, Sheriff of Alameda County, for $5000
damages for the illegal arrest of Paul
Kay, whose petition for release on a writ
of habeas corpus was granted by Judge
Ellsworth shortly after noon yesterday.
Kay is the man who over two months
ago was arrested on a charge of grand
larceny for stealing two valueless pool
tickets on the races at Emeryville from
one P. Wall. Thrice had
his former attorneys attempted to secure
his release on habeas corpus proceedings,
and thrice they failed. Attorney Pistolesi,
however, dared the fourth attempt anu
proved to Judge iiu.ll yesterday that the
original complaint in the Justices' Court
fatally defective. Judge Hall dis
d the charge, but remanded the pris
oner to the custody of the snenff ana or
. the District Attorney to apprise the
Grand Jury, with a view of securing
Kay's indictment.
r i lie alert attorney protested that his
client should be released. Judge Hall re-
I, and Pistolesi then sued out a fifth
writ of habeas corpus, which was heard
before Judge Ellsworth at noon to-day.
Judge Ellsworth held that Judge Hall
had no jurisdiction in remanding tne pris
under the circumstances, and or
dered his release. But before Kay had
got both feet outside the courtroom, and
while tv steppe.i into the corridor Deputy
Sheriff George Wales rearrested him
â¢without a warrant and "on the same
chargi declared. Kay was re-
Incarcerated at the instance of Sheriff
rs iin the advice of District Attorney
Allen.
Later Attorney Pistolesi appeared again
before Judge Ellsworth, apprising him of
Kaj. s rearrest, which he declared consti
tuted tl)e grossest contempt of court. He
Showed that tnere was no complaint, in
dictment or information filed against his
client, yet Jud^e Ellsworth declined to
aci further In the premises. As a linal
recourse Pistolesi went before Judge
Greene and sued outâ for the sixth timeâ
a writ of habeas corpus for Kay's re
lease, on the ground that h>- was illegally
arrested. Judge Greene will hear this to
morrow morning, but intimated that he
would in all probability discharge the
prisoner. If so. Attorney Pistolesi will
then file a (3000 damage suit against Sher
iff Rogers and his bondsmen for the false
Imprisonment of his client. Should the
writ, however, be denied, the attorney
will sue out a writ before the Supreme
Court, and in case he is then confirmed
in his tenets he will likewise bring the
damage suit.
The District Attorney contends that
Kay is now held on suspicion of having
committed a felony, and a complaint will
be. filed, it is known that Mr. Wall. Kay's
alleged victim, has all along shown a dis
position not to force the prosecution of
his original charge.
LIVING PICTURES ARE
TURNED TO THE WALL
â 
MR. MASON AND HIS FRIENDS
ABE TRIUMPHANT.
AJameda's Social Set Decides to Put
Proper Clothing on Its
Statuary.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
141^ I'ark Street, March 30.
Brainard C. Brown's onslaught on the
local school trustees has faded into in
significance in comparison with the pub
lic interest taken in P. B. Mason's cam- '
paign against living pictures. The edict
has gone Forth that even mention of Per
ham Nahl's living bronze statuary will
not be tolerated in the upper strata of
Kncinal society in which Mr. Mason
moves. Costly works of art In marble are
being appropriately draped and some
pictures that do not live are being turned
to the wall bo as not to shock the mod
esty of Mr. Mason and Flevnon Drake,
the Christ Church vestryman, whose
crusade against the real thing in statu
ary being exhibited at church socials is
the talk of the townâ outside of th<
of course, of which the gentlemen are
honored members.
The ladies â¢ : St. Agnes Guild, whose
Dtertainment was so cruehy
crushed by the opposition of the vestry
to the Xahl numbers on the programme,
Â«.re doing their best to maintain harmony
Jn the church, but Inwardly they are
nursing considerable disappointment and
chagrin. They refuse positively to give
an opinion of Mr. Mason <>v .Mr. Drake, i
but there is a look on their faces which
expresses in silence a great deal more
than they would .are to tell. TJjey sti !
insist that living pictures are neither de
moralizing nor Improper and are not out
of place at a church entertainment when
sandwiched in between a little music and
a few efforts at declamation. Mrs. if. k.
Osborn. president of the guild, steadfast
ly refuses to discuss the situation. The
other ladies of the organization are fol
lowing her example.
Mr. Mason has withdrawn his offer of
$20 for information leading to the iden
tity of the person who gave the story
out. He was in a more amiable mood
to-day than when seen last night by a
reporter. He is impressed with the idea
that lie has don< a great public service
In nipping the living pictures before they
donned their lights and coating of bronze,
and with this idea he i< satisfied to en
flure -ill f'i (> adverse comment that the
ladies may direct at him.
"1 will not make any defense of my ac
tion or stand in the matter.' said Mr.
Mason. "It is an affair that only in
terests the church, and the general pub
lic and the newspapers have no business
to meddle with it. At first I was anxious
to know who had let the secret out, but j
now 1 have come to the conclusion that !
the information would not interest me.
My side of the story needs no explanation
arid if it did I would not give it."
BYROD'S MARRIAGE DENIED.
A Nephew From Washington Is
After the Estate.
OAKLAND. March 30.â George R. Kr.s-
WOrtta Of Washington. D. C, lias author

estate of the late Sarah Byrod. Ens
worth declares he la the nephew and only

and the deceased.

months ago Mrs. Bvrod. who had been a
teacher in the Oakland public schools,
died and left an estate worth about $6000.
DECLARE GAGE
HAS FORGOTTEN
TOO SWIFTLY
City of Dr. Pardee Is
Cinched.
LEAVITT'S BILLS KILLED
FRANK JORDAN WINS HIS ONLY
BATTLE.
Even the Transposition of a Noted
Poem ueems to Have Slipped
the Memory of the
Governor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. March 30.
Oakland is in sackcloth and ashes. Sev
eral messages have been sent to Sacra
mento t"-day concerning the pocketing of
certain bills, and the answer has invari
ably been the same. Nut a single bill in
which Alameda County had an Interest
except one has become a law.
Governor Gage has not been generous
to the city wherein lives Dr. Pardee.
Many think he has not been ordinarily
kind' while iust a few think he has been
positively mean if not unjust. Among
this latter vlass it a host of disappointed
deputies, who were banking their all un
iln (iuvernor signing the many bills
amending the county government act.
Oakland will not have a harbor com
mission, the various departments of the
county government will haw to struggle
along" without assistance more than that
allowed two years ago, and even tht State
University is not to have Its new build
ing.
Yet Governor Gage is being highly com
manded for the relief he has affored Oak
land in one particular. For two years the
Unit- shivering daughters of John C. Pel
ton, the State's pioneer schoolteacher,
have been peddling their father's poems
on the trains, and they have been tol
erated in the hope that in the future
spine Legislature might grant the old
pt-dugogue relief. Governor Gagu has
bigned the bill granting Mr. Pelton $lUOU,
and for a year at least he will not be in
need. This may be a small return to the
party fur six months of shouting for Mr.
Gage, but it is better than nothing.
Tin' claims of Oakland certainly have
not received the recognition from the
Governor to which many think they are
entitled. At the last Republican State
convention everybody knows what Ala
rh.da County did. A large portion of it
went to Sacramento and howled and
howled for its favorite candidate, as it I
had a right to do. They were even pre
pared with a ready made song to cele
brate the victory of Dr. Pardee after he
should have been nominated With un
swerving fidelity to their party the Ala
meda County contingent, seeing that their
choice was not to get the plum, called a
meeting of their committee on poetry,
and with the assistance of C'a! Ewing,
Jim Oliver and W. Nat Friend, trans
posed the poem. Anybody knows what a
hard task it must have been to transpose
a poem ending with "dee" and to make it
rhythmically correct by substituting
"Gage." However, the task wa_s success
fully completed, and although it might
have tasted something like crow to a tur
key appetite, the "Alameda solid" howled
it "just as lustily for the Governor-elect.
Now lie has had his revenge for that
,poem.
The greatest surprise is the pocketing
of Senator Leavitt'a pet measure creating
a Harbor Commission for Oakland. The
Senator from the moment he was nomi
nated never wavered a particle in his
allegiance to Mr. Gage and his friends,
especially Colonel Burns. During the lat
ter part of the Legislature the m<ist
prominent Burns man at Sacramento was
Senator Leayitt, and it was confidently
expected that his measure at least would
receive the official sanction. But it is
dead, as are also the Senator's two other
hills for arranging the salary for the
Harbor Commissioners, and for appropri
ating 000,000 for maintaining the commis
sion and building wharves.
Auditor Cal Kwing and Assessor Dal
ton, and to a lesser degree District At
torney Allen and the Coroner and Re
corder and the Sheriff are particularly
sorrowful. All have been in Sacramento for
weeks, incurring heavy expensen for the
purpose of boosting along their own little
lights, and all have landed in the same
tureen. Their wretchedness is not alle
viated by the thought of the heroic work
including the surgery of the celebrated
poem, that they did last fall for the man
From Los Angeles.
These actions of the Governor leave the
immense patronage of the harbor, con
sisting of a wharfinger at $100 per month,
in the hands of the City Council, and has
given Increased hope to the nineteen can
didates who will struggle next Monday
night for the appointment.
Out of nine members of the Legisla
ture from this county, four voted for Mr.
(lake's friend Burns for Senator. Th*
county is now attempting to figure out
how much more it might have received
;>! the hands of the Governor had the
delegation been a unit for Mr. Herri n' a
candidate and if its people had not earned
the title of "rice eaters" by proclaiming
so strongly against Mr. Burns at the time
of the defection of the member from
Berkeley.*
Charged in Two Courts.
Wan Sing, a Chinese lottery ticket
seller, was fined $1') by Judge Conlan yes
terday, and acting Police Judge Barry
imposed a similar fine upon him. There
was consternation at the City Prison later
when there was a prisoner short. Ser
geant I^indheimer spent considerable time
in investigating the mattpr, and discov
ered that Wan Sing had been booked
twico for the same offense and also fined
twice.
Petition of B. Schwartz & Co.
B. Schwartz & Co as a firm and its
members, individually, Bernard Schwartz
and H. Kirschbraum, filed yesterday a

Sold Watered Milk.
Chief Food Inspector Dockery yesterday

a charge of adulterating milk. Several
gallons of watered milk found in Cran
dall's possession was confiscated and
dumped Into the street.
MABEL JORDAN A
VICTIM OF AMBITION
OAKLAND. March 30.â After an illness of only two
weeks, Mabel F. Jordan, daughter of William H. and
Mrs. Mary F. Jordan and niece of County Clerk Jor
dan, died at 5 o'clock this afternoon at the home of
her mother, on Twenty-third street. Miss Jordan was a
native of thiH city, aged 19 years, and was very popular
In local social and musical circles. She was a member
of the famous Hay den trio. Last year the deceased gradu
ated from the Oakland High School, and since last Sep
tember she had been attending the State University at
Berkeley. Her death was accelerated by her ambition in
trying to make up six months' arrears in her studies at
the university. Two weeks ago the severe mental strain
resulted in an attack of spinal meningitis, which was com-

DR. SELFRIDGE
IS CONVICTED
OF CRUELTY
Drove a Fine Mare!
Sixty Miles.
i ANIMAL'S CHiST SUNK IN
THE VALUABLE STEED IS NOW
WORTHLESS.
For Two Days the Doctor Was Touring I
Through Centerville, San Jose,
Alma and the
Vicinity.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 30.
Dr. Clarence M. Selfrldge was convicted
this afternoon of cruelty to animals. His
trial consumed the whole day in Justice
Larue's court and the testimony showed
that the wrecking of a fine animal was ,
caused by driving it from Alma to Oak
land, a distance of nearly sixty miles, j
without giving it any rest.
The evidence showed that Dr. Selfridge
: hired the horse and drove to Centerville.
| The stableman did not like to let him
have tile superb animal without the pro
prietor's consent, but finally permitted
Dr. Selfridge to take out a gray mare, I
which was the best horse in the place.
The physician used his own buggy and
the livery animal was in perfect condi
tion -when taken from the stable. Two
days later the mare was brought back in
such a condition that she could hardly
stand, and she is now useless for livery
purposes.
When Dr. Selfridge was told of the ani
mal's condition he sent two veterinary
surgeons to look after her and A. J.
Simonson, the owner of the horse, en
gaged a third. The three have not been
able to improve the horse's condition to
any extent.
One of the witnesses testified that Dr.
Selfridge said he had driven to Center
ville the first day, to San Jose the next,
and from there back to Oakland in tour
hours and a half. Evidence was offered
to prove that the doctor used the whip
and that the animal was very speedy and j
never needed a whip; moreover, that shÂ« I
would not stand it. Her fore feet are now
BO stiff that she cannot walk and her |
chest is sunken in, and an expert horse
man said that she. was absolutely value
less
The doctor testified that he went
through Alma, which is beyond LosGatos
and that he drove from there to Oakland
with a few stops. He was not aware of
the condition of the animal until tele
phoned to on the evening of the day on !
which he returned and he at once ordered ]
two veterinaries to attend to her.
Deputy District Attorney Hynes made j
a forcible argument to the five jurymen j
who tried the case and they returned a
verdict of guilty. Sentence will be pro
nounced April (J.
The Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Animals is greatly pleased with |
the success of its efforts to carry on its I
work It has brought about three prose
cutions within the past week and in two !
instances it has been sustained, while the \
third case is pending.
BRANDES MURDER CASE
NOW NEAR ITS CLOSE
ATTORNEY BENNETT CON
â¢ CLUDES HIS ARGUMENT.
He Refers to the Prosecution's Ex
perts as "a Handful of Ignor
ant Physicians."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. March 30.
It is expected now that the fate of the
accused murderer Brandes will be deter
mined by the jury next Saturday.
Attorney Bennett, fur the defense, con
tinued his argument to-day, directing his
efforts mainly to the theory that Lillian
Brandes' death was caused by asphyxia
tion due to hanging. For several hours
he held the skull of the dead girl in his
hand, illustrating his theories. The pres
ence of the blood stains at the back of
the skull, he claimed, was (hit- to the fact
that the girl lay fpr thirty-two hours
after death in such a position that the
blood settled there. He declared that the
skull speaks for itself and controverts the
theory which Dr. Buteau conceived when
performing the autopsy. Jn conclusion
Attorney Bennett said:
"Are you going to hang a man on the
speculative theory of a handful of ignor
ant physicians? Why, wherever you
turn- innocence stares you in the face.
Brandes has been the victim of an awful
set of circumstances. He has been an un
fortunate creature, and I hope that you
wUJ bring in such a verdict as you will
never regret."
An hour still remained before adjourn
ment time, and this was occupied by At
torney Sawyer, Bennett's colleague, who
will probably conclude his plea by noon
to-morrow. The dosing argument by Dis
trict Attorney Allen will be ve*y brief.
Rescued a Chinese Slave.
A pretty . sixteen-year-old Chinese girl
was rescued from a den on Ross alley
by Policeman Murray last night. The
girl sent a note to the Presbyterian Mis
sion informing- the superintendent that
she was being held against her will and
begging her to secure her release. She also
.described how she would be dressed and
that when the police entered the den she
would wave a handkerchief so that they
would at once recognize her.
M (Murray went to the place last night
and as he entered the girl had not put
on the dress she was to have worn, but
catching a glimpse of the officer she im
mediately waved her handkerchief. Mc-
Murray then took her in charge and es
corted" her to the Presbyterian Mission,
where she will be cared for.
To Test the Wine Tax.
Restaurant proprietors of this city have

gerot to make a test case on the wine

The contention will be made on appeal
that Congress did not Intend to tax cheap
wines which are given free with meals.
A NOTED EDUCATOR
DIES AT BERKELEY
ANDREW J. RICKOFF of world #
A wide fame in educational cir- |
h\ cles passed away at his home, 0
corner of Charming way and |
Telegraph avenue,' Berkeley, last 0
Wednesday. Although retired from [
active service in the world of learning #
for the past four years, his loss will be |
severely felt, he having been termed the Â£
'"Chevalier Bayard" of his profession. |
Best known among his text books a
were a reader and an arithmetic com- j
piled for D. Appleton & Co., the well Â£
known New York publishers. The i
readers, published in 1577, found sale
to the number of over 5,000,000 copies, y
His arithmetics did not net such hand- X
some returns, owing to a combine on |
the part of book publishers. '
During his life he was regarded as â¢
one of the principal educators of the J
United States. In the State of Ohio, â¢
where he received his early schooling /
and spent the major portion of his life, O
he was honored by the highest posi- I
tions in the school system of the â¢
State. In 1881 he was made a life mem- I
ber of the National Teachers' Asso- #
ciation, being at that itme president of I
the Ohio State Board of Examiners of #
Teachers. In the cities of Cleveland ( |
and Cincinnnati he held the Superin- '#
tendency of Public Schools and served |
on various Boards of Education. He A
r also was an expert on classification and grading of schools and an authority |
L on school architecture. â¢
i While visiting his only son in Washington State six years ago the boy |
L was drowned and his heart-broken parents returned to New York. Rickoffs Â£
f wife died about a year ago, and he came to Berkeley with his daughter, i
L Bertha Monroe Riekoff. and resided there until his death. Another daugh- Â£
' ter Mrs. Martha Hinckley, is principal of a large school in Cleveland, Ohio. â 
L A private funeral will be held at his home this afternoon, after which the L
' remains will be shipped to Cleveland, where those of his wife rest. y
HAROLD M. SEWALL ON
AFFAIRS IN SAMOA
; BELIEVES TN THE ABOLITION
01" ITS KINGSHIP.
Roasts This Government for Not
Faithfully Abiding by the Fa
mous Berlin Treaty.
No one at present in this country is
better abli to discuss the present trou
ble at Samoa than Harold M. Sewall,
who has been the United States' special
agent to Hawaii ever since the latter's j
annexation and who arrived in this city j
a few days ago. He is a member of the ,
oornmisskn that drafted the famous Ber
lin treaty under which the Government
of Sam.a was operated. In an interview
yesterday Mr. Sewall said:
I was fully advised at Honolulu of evenU in
Samoa and" have anticipated the perplexing
conditions which have at last been brought ;
about. The neglect and indifference of our |
Government during the first and m n<] admin
istrations of Cleveland caused the present i-.m
--dttl ms. Had this Government faithfully
abided by the Berlin agreement and done what
It was honorably bound to do under that agre< -
ment the present trouble would have been
avoided. ,
Periodically th<se disturbances have arisen
in Samoa "l do not like to think that they
are to be traced to any authorized action of
German agents there, but there is a strange
similarity In th<> situation now and in the pre
ceding crisis, precipitated by German action ;
This goes hack to the very beginning of our
r,-lationa anil Germafi relations with Samoa.
In 1884 and ISSS it wan only by the unauthorized
action of our Consul in rasing our nar over
the is-lands that German seizure of them was
avoided. In ISS7 and ISSS the situation was
similar to that of to-dayâ disavowals from the ;
German Foreign Office, but acts of aggression
almost to the point of conflict with our civil
and naval authorities on the part of the Ger
man representative In Samoa.
I am delighted that Admiral Kautz has acted
in iupport if the terms of the Tiprlin a.^r*>o
ment which if honestly abided by will gl%e
the Islands all the Government they need. I
regret as mmh that the guns of the Pmladel
iihia should be turned against the finest native
people In the Pacific I firmly believe that an
ateri and benevolent diplomacy at -Washington
London, Berlin and Apia could have avoided
the present distressful situation, and even now
It may not be too late to do so.
Mataafa himself is to my mind a representa
tive Samoun In birth and ability and in all the
qualifications that make him fit to rule. Above
this consideration must he placed the fact that
three powers are honorably pledged to support
the Herlln act and the decision of the American ,
Chief Justice appointed under It. It is due to j
the powers that they themselves be vindicated ;
first by the restoration of the status ante quoâ
the status existing before the present revolu
tionary proceedings. Then if I were to be asked
the remedy for the whole situation, it would
not be in the division of the group, which is
not large enough to admit or separate owner
ship: not In the recall of honest and able
American officials who have done their duty
in the face of great discouragement on all
sides but In certain amendments to the Herlin
act chief and principal of which would be the
abolition of the kingship of the Islands. With
this principal amendment and the loyal support
of the Berlin act. which has done more for
Samoa than I believed possible when it was
framed, I believe a clear way will he found
nut of the present difficulties, and I hope our
Government will not be slow in availing itself
of so prompt and humane a solution.
ITALIAN NOBLEMEN.
Two of Them Arrive and Are at the
Palace.
Two Italian noblemen arrived in this
city yesterday from Genoa, Ttaly, ami
took apartments at the Palace. They
are Marquis Dominic Pallavicino and
his brother. Marquis Ale.xandre Palla
vlcino. The former, whose health is
somewhat shattered, is accompanied by
his physician, Dr. G. Perrando. In the
party is also L. Taglioli, whom the oth
ers met In New York and prevailed on
to come to this coast.
The Pallavicinos are among the wealth
iest people In Italy, owning 1 numerous
family castles and immense landed in
terests that are highly productive.- The
elder Dominic is chairman and one of
the principal stockholders in the Medi
terranean Railway Company, which la
operated partly In the southeastern por
tion of Italy." While in New York he
had a conference with Brown Brothers,
brokers, in regard to $200,000 worth of
Confederate State bonds, issued by the
State of Virginia during the Civil War
and purchased by his father. The bonds
art- now held by the family in common
and the brokers incline to the opinion
that they will be recognized by Virginia
and about $15,000 may yet be realized
upon them. The Pallavicinos also possess
some plantation interests in Virginia.
Marquis Dominic speaks but very little
English, but through an interpreter he
said:
"] am perfectly astounded at the won
derful development of California in the
short period of its existence. Why.
everything grows here. What a soil it
is to be sure. If we could but transfer
it' to Italy how thankful we would be.
In the southern part oi the State I saw
nothing but groves of oranges and olives,
the perfect cultivation of which would
put Italy to the blush.
"Again I cannot compliment your peo
ple too highly on the splendid operation
and equipment of your railroad system.
It eclipses anything I have seen any
where. Such a well favored State as
California would be hard to find, I am
sure."
PEOPLE'S PARTY DISSENSIONS.
Hearing of the Charge Against Ex-
Secretary Clough for Stealing
the Minute Book.
The dissensions in the camp of the Peo
ple's party were aired in Judge Graham's
court Wednesday when the search warrant
case against George A. Clough, the ex
pelled secretary of the County Committee,
came up for hearing. The People's party
was represented by Attorney .Tame? Gal
lagher and Clough by Attorney Monteith.
Clough is charged with stealing the min
ute book of the County Commitee, and
the book was introduced in evidence. Dr.
Cli-vÂ»>land. the present chairman' of the
County Committee, testified that the min
ute book belonged to the committee. He
did not see It bought and could not say it
was bought with the money of the com
mittee, but it was used by the committee
and was, ex necessitate, the property of
the committee.
Ex-Chairman Glllesple of the committee
testified that the book belonged to the
committee because Clough had put in a
voucher for the amount and If the com
mittee paid for it then Olough stole it. He
further testified that on March 14 at a
meeting of the County Commitee, Clough.
Dr. Griswokl and Garret W. Smith had
been expelled from the party.
The hearing was interspersed with long
arguments by the attorneys, especially re
garding the admlsÃibillty of the book
as evidence. The defense will be heard
Saturday morning.
WAR TAX DECISIONS.
Commissioner at Washington Trans
mits a Few That Are of Inter
est to Business Men.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue
has transmitted to Internal Revenue Col
lector Lynch the following decisions on
the war tax stamp law, which are of in
terest 10 the business community:
Âil tax (license) need not be paid for
thÂ«* sale ol wood alcohol provided it be entirely
free from admixture with distilled spirits or
vino ..r othei alcoholic liquor.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue again
warns the public that drafts must be stamped
at the time they are issued by the drawer re
gardless Of the fact of whether they are ulti
mately paid or not. Some parties have pub
lished opinions that drafts are not taxable
until paid, but these opinions are entirely er
roneous.
In view of the increased time for which loss
in warehouse is allowed the commissioner has
decided that any loss which exceeds by more
than 60 per cent the legal allowance on any
cask or package will be regarded as excessive,
and Collectors will immediately collect the tax
due on the original contents of such cask or
package, less only the allowance authorized
by law. As before, a smaller loss than that
specified will also be regarded as excessive
where the condition of the warehouse or the
cooperage of the packages in the warehouse in
dicates the want of proper cure on the part
of the distiller.
When a draft properly stamped is presented
for acceptance, and the acceptor writes on the
draft an order for some hank to pay the draft;
this additional order requires an additional I
cent stamp, whether the draft is at sight or
on time.
A broker who receives from foreign houses
orders for liquors or wines in casks or bar
relÃ, purchases these liquors from W. L. D.'s
and executes bills of lading in his own name
collecting payment himself, is liable to tax
as W. L. I), (wholesale liquor dealer).
Hills of exchange drawn abroad but payable
in the Tnited States are taxable at the rate
of 2 cents on each $100, whether the bills are
at sight on demand or otherwise than at sight
or on demand.
A DEFECTIVE BOILER.
A New Danger Confronts the Unfor
tunate Inmates of the City and
County Hospital.
Danger of a boiler explosion has been
added to the other terrors that confront
the patients and inmates at the City and
County Hospital. A report that has been
filed with the Board of Supervisors gives
the details of this latest addition to the
chamber of horrors on Potrcro avenue.
It is as follows:
SAX FRANCISCO, March :'T. 1599.
To the Honorable the Board of Supervisors of
the City and County of San FranciscoâGen
tlemen: An internal examination of the steam
toiler located at the City and County Hos
pital was made on the 2Mh inst. by our in
spectc.r, David Stark, and his report of such
examination is as- follows:
"This is a horizontal, tubular boiler, sixty
inches by sixteen feet, built of iron. The
thickness of the shell is live-sixteenths of an
Inch; of the head, three-eighths of an inch.
It Is double riveted and fairly braced. The
size of the dome Is thirty-three by forty inches.
This boiler contains fifty-eight four-inch tubes,
and one live-inch lever safety valve, set at
eighty pounds. The steam gauge and gauge
cocks are in good condition. The blow valve
is clear. The feed apparatus is in gooii con
dition. General care and management ire. lalr.
Remarks: This boiler is old and weak in
places The steam dome is thirty three inches
In diameter and riveted to ilv shell by a sin
gle row of rivets. The shell under the dome
Is cut away, leaving a hole in the shell twenty
four Inches in diameter, making it very un
safe at the pressure they arc now carrying,
viz : seventy-five to eighty pounds. This boil
er was not built this way originally. This hole
has been cut in the shell since, for what pur
pose I ennnot say. I would not advise that
the pressure carried exceed fifty or flfty-t}ve
pounds. The furnace doors should have new
liners. By reducing the grate surface from
twenty to sixteen square feet, better results
will be obtained and fuel saved."
Yours truly.
A. P. REDDING, Secretary.
Both Undertakers Satisfied.
The contest for the possession of the
body of Charles I. Highet was ended yes
terday by ih<' representatives: of the" es
tate of the deceased paying Undertaker
MeAvoy for the embalming done by him.
The body was thereupon delivered to Un
dertaker Gray.
Want a Boxing Permit.
The Merchants' Athletic Club, through

sion to give a boxing exhibition at Wood

ESTABLISHMENTS LICENSED
TO DEBAUCH THE YOUNG AND
PANDER TO THE DEPRAVED
Market-Street Phonograph Parlors Permitted by
the Authorities to Offer a Daily Outrage
Upon the People of This City.
Children Corrupted by Indecent Sights and Sounds â A Pub
lic Evil Which Has Grown to Appalling
Power.
THE attention of pedestrians was
attracted last night by an un
usual scene on Market street
above Powell. A crowd of boys,
just liberated from their duties
at an evening school, were throng
ing into an establishment which for
months has been an affront and an
insult to those whose necessity or in
clination prompts them to use the main
thoroughfare of the city. The place.
Into which the children thronged, was
brilliantly lighted. The discordant, in
harmonious sounds of a phonograph
attracted attention and solicited a pat
ronage that meant moral pollution in
its satisfaction. Two boys In the place
told the story of a new evil whi *h has
grown with inconceivable rapidity in
the c;ty.
These boys stood before a "muto
prr.pe" above which was the allurine:
nlgn "for men only." The elder of the
twu had dropped a nickel into the ma
chine and, quickly grasping his young
er and smaller companion, he lifted
lilm until the little fellow's eyes could
follow the moving scenes that inflamed
his Imagination with corrupting
thought. The incident meant a profit
of 5 ce!it3 to the proprietor of the place
and a lasting lesson in Immorality to
the child.
This evil has worked an insidious pro
press in the city for many months. The
police, with customary ignorance, di
not know of its existence. The local
society whose aim it is to suppress
vice, at least in its open expression, is
Tdind to the fact that decent men and
women are affronted by the glaring
advertisement of indecent show shops
and that children are corrupted by
sights and sounds which are flaunted
on the main thoroughfare of the city.
Protest after protest has been made
against these establishments, but no
material result has followed complaint.
The "phonograph parlor" has become a
recognized and legitimate business in
dustry in the city. For some reason
best known to those who are financial
ly interested the police are deaf, dumb
and blind to the existence and the char
acter of these places. In this city the
phonograph and the "vitascope" have
become instruments of the grossest im
morality. On Market street, between
Mason and Kearny, establishments are
conducted to debase the minds and
morals of children, to outrage the de
cency of reputable men and women and
to pander to the lowest and vilest as
pirations of the debased.
A powerful corporation is the feeder
for these Places, and municipal tolera
tion is the right by which they exist.
Their location needs, perhaps, no de
scription for the people of the city who
are affronted by them daily in sight
and hearing. For the benefit of the po
lice and for the officers of the local so
ciety, whose aim is to suppress vice, it
should be stated that the head and
front of the evil is located in the es
tablishment of Peter Bacigalupi at 1030
Market street. Bacigalupi is the pio
neer in phonographic filth and through
him the other local retail sellers of this
commodity receive their supplier.
The evil has grown to such dimen
sions that a plain statement of its char
acter has become a public duty. A de
scription of the establishment of Baci
galupi will illustrate thoroughly the
character of every other "phonograph
parlor" in the city. In this indecent
show shop at 1030 Market street there
are phonographs, "vitascopes," "muto-
Bcopes," "artoscopes" and electrical ap
pliances of many sorts. An unmusical
phonograph with horn* attachment as
saults the ears of pedestrians day and
right. Crowds throng into the place
and choose what sight or sound suits
the fancy. Over the "mutoscopes."
eloquent in their dumb presentation of
vicious scene?, are placed sain- 1^ pic
tures of those that move under the
charm of a 5-cent piece.
M m and women are attracted to the
plact under the impression that it af
fords a decent and innocent diversion.
When they have entered tlvy an' in-
Bulted by lewd pictures, suggestive
songs and the ribald remarks of loafers
inspired by the foul scenes of the muto
scope. Protest has availed nothing und
the pla.ee thrives. Tender the false
colors of art indecent moving pictures
are displayed. Scenes of every sort
that may inflame the imagination of
the young and satisfy that "f the de
praved are in public view and yet the
police are ignorant of the evil and its

Lesson in Immorality.
consequences.
Children of ail ages are admitted and
may for -a 5-cent piece be debased as
they could not be perhaps in any other
public place in the city. If one enjoys
the confidence of Bacigalupi that
worthy â¢will condescend to place in his
phonograph dialogues and songs that
are shocking In their immorality and
gross-, indecent suggestion. Bacigalupi
has a plentiful store of such things,
but they arc reserved for the delecta
tion of select patrons. The owner has
become a notorious panderer to the
young and the vicious and he offers his
wares with a single thought cf what
shall be the best profit.
At 848 Market street is another es
tablishment similar in character tc that
conducted by Bacigalupi. This concern
is operated by M. Kollman, a cigar
dealer. The place is thoroughly open
to the public. Its suggestive, indecent
pictures and moving scenes are free
to every possessor of a 5-cent piece.
Boys and girls are daily corrupted in
the shop and those that care may sice
upon young faces expressions that
should not be there. M. Kollman, like
his associates, enjoys a municipal
license to corrupt the young of the city.
At 730 Market street is anothe.- "pho
nograph parlor" weighed w:th its im
moral merchandise and appealing for
public patronage. At 415 Kearny street
is still another that i 3 crowded day and
night by men, women and children.
There has never been in this city
perhaps so flagrant an outrage upon
public decency as these establishments
offer, yet the authorities, v.ith every
warrant to act, are inactive. The Su
pervisors have adopted laws to sup
press this immoral traffic, but the laws
are inoperative. There are at least
four municipal ordinances that make

the proprietors of the indecent places
amenable to punishment, but punish
ment is not inflicted and suppression
has not been attempted.
In hundreds of saloons and public
resorts these moving pictures and viLe
exhibitions have been distributed. In
decent placards are placed above each
to allure and attract. Curious people,
careful of their nickels, may in each
machine receive a sample view, and
ii" satisfied may then purchase the rest
of the disgusting exhibition. Thou
sands upon thousands of dollars have
been invested in the business and a
tremendous daily revenue is the result.
A powerful corporation has been or
ganized to debauch the young and to
insult the decent elements of the city.
Men and women are employed to pose
for outrageous scenes, and then the
vile presentations are offered for the
inspection of the boys and girls of the
city. Loafers are hired to sing ribald
songs into a phonograph and the de
bauching sounds are sold into the lis
tening ears of children.
The corporation that controls the in
dustry in this city is wealthy and pow
erful. The directors of the concern
are as follows: C. M. Koolsaac. S.
Friedlander, G. Payne, P. E. Ryan.
Peter Bacigalupi, H. Green and J.
O'Brien. These men control the des
tinies of the great vice breeder and
flood the town with machines that in
any community, except San Francisco
perhaps, would be suppressed as con
trary to public morals.
SCHOOL JANITORS
MUST HAVE A PULL
THE SCALING OF SALARIES
CREATES A STIR.
Proposition to Change Principals
From One School to Another in
the Interest of Efficiency.
The action taken by the Board of Edu
cation Wednesday in ordering a general
reduction in the wages paid to janitors
in the employ of the department has had
the effect of creating a great stir among
the employes affected by the cut. The
reduction amounts to about 7M per cent
of the. total salary roll and effects a sav
ing to the department of $881 50 a month.
The system of paying janitors a fixed
sum per month for each room under their
care will afford the Janitors* Committee
of the Board of Education an opportunity
to do some good work. The number of
roomp assigned to each janitor is fixed
by the committee. Those janitors who
have sufficient "pull" to get plenty of
rooms assigned to them will not suffer on
account of the new order of things. Those
who have no friends at court will be
forced to accept such scanty crumbs as
fall to their lot.
There is a feeling among the members
of the Board of Education that the pol
icy of allowing principals to remain in
one school from year to year is a bad
ore nnd has resulted in many of the
teachers becoming fossilized and of com
paratively small value. In order to aseer
ta"in how far this may be true and at the
name time inaugurate a new order of
things, it is proposed to transfer prin
cipals from one school to another.
SLOW PROGRESS IN
ANTI-GAMBLING CASE
BUT FIVE JURORS SECURED TO
TRY H. L. JONES.
Attorney Ach"s Motion to Discharge
the Entire Panel on a Techni
cality Is Denied.
The tedious work of securing: a jury to
try H. L. Jones, charged with violating
the new anti-poolselling ordinance, â * H3
resumed before Judge Mogan in Police
Court No. 1 yesterday afternoon. At the
hour or adjournment the following had
been finally acepted as jurors in the case:
George McLeod, G59 Howard street.
G. B. Larose, butcher, 535 Valencia.
D. Black, salesman, 804 Webster.
F. B. Norton, provision merchant, 715
Cole street.
Bernard Bradley, painter, 1264 Eddy
street.
Up to the present time the defense has
made use of five peremptory challenges
and the prosecution ihree. Ten witnesses
have been excused for cause, generally
for having formed opinions as to the guilt
or innocence of the accused. At the pres
ent rate it will take all of next week to
ml the jury box with "good men and
true," who will fully meet the exacting
requirements of Attorney Ach.
Mr Ach was in an objecting mood yes
terday, and the record of the proceedings
bears convincing evidence of this fact. He
objected to the questioning of veniremen
by the court, to the manner in which
they were called into the jury box, and
finally moved that the entire panel be dis
charged because one of the hundred citi
zens sumonod informed the court that he
had not been personally served with a
summons. These objections were over
ruled, as were a score of others of less

TWO MORE WEIGHERS
SUSPENDED FROM DUTY
SHARKEY AND QUINT FOLLOW
RHODES.
Assistant Weighers Thomas J. Sharkey
and Douglass IT. Quint were suspended
from duty yesterday by request of Spe
cial Agents Lfnck and Smith, who are in
vestigating the charges of drunkenness
and absence from duty which have been
preferred against them and against
Weigher Rhodes, who was suspended on
the preceding day. It came to the knowl
edge of the special agents that Rhodes,
Sharkey and Quint had been attempting
to intimidate witnesses by threatening to
have similar charges of drunkenness pre
ferred against them if they should testify
against the accused.
The accusations against the three men
are serious, and the evidence taken thus
far indicates that those charges are well
founded. Intoxication seems to have
been regarded as one of the virtues of
the weighers' department, the three ac
cused men being the most conspicuous
examples of dereliction of duty. Evidence
against Rhodes is accumulating-, and the
fact that he has been 9. persistent bor
rower of money from fellow laborers in
the Federal vineyard and a constant for
getter of financial obligations when pay
day came around, has also been brought
up.
The special agents say that they are
determined to probe the matter to the
bottom, and to uncover irregularities of
conduct not only in the weighers' but in
every other department in the CustonÂ»
House, if it should require three year*,
to accomplish the work. They invite in
formation as to Irregularities and will
hold all such information as confiden
tial. All that is necessary is to push the
button and the agents will do the rest.

RELIEF COMMISSION HAS
CLOSED UP ITS AFFAIRS
Pocket Veto of the Bill Reimbursing
Claus Spreckels Stops Further Aid
to Drought Sufferers.
Balance of the Fund Returned to the Gentleman,
Who Requests That the Notes Given by
Assisted Farmers Be Canceled.
In view of the refusal of Governor Gage to sign the bill en
abling them to continue their labors, the commission appointed by
ex-Governor Budd to furnish relief to the drought sufferers in Mon
terey and San Luis Obispo counties has decided to terminate its
labors. The necessary steps were taken at a meeting held yester
day in the Mills building. There were present all the members of
the commission, F. W. Dohnnann, president of the Merchants' As
sociation, chairman; Mayor Phelan and A. B. Spreckels, president
of the State Agricultural Society.
The commissioners decided unanimously, even though they
realized that more relief was needed, to return to Mr. Claus Spreck
els the undisturbed balance of the $25,00 vhe had advanced for the
drought sufferers.
It was found from the books of the commission that $11,675 82
had b-en advanced from this funr" to the needy, leaving a balance of
$13,324 18. For the return of this to Mr. Spreckels a resolution was
adopted, and the money will be refunded within a few days. To rep
resent the $ 11,675 82 advanced there are in the hands of the com
mittee unsolicited promissory notes representing $9784 20. These
notes were forced on the agents of the commission by those seeking
relief but refusing to accept it unless they were allowed to give
their promises to pay.
These notes, at the special request of Mr. Claus Spreckels, the
commission decided to return to their makers, and Secretary L. M.
King was so instructed.
At the quarterly meeting of the Merchants' Association last
night President F. W. Dohnnann made the following brief state
ment of the work of the Relief Commission:
"When the cry of distress came up from the drought-stricken
counties in the southern part of the State last fall Governor Budd,
who was in San Francisco, called upon one of our leading citizens
to advance funds for the needed relief. The request was unhesi
tatingly granted, and Mr. Claus Spreckels advanced $25,000, with
the promise of $25,000 more if needed, with the understanding that
it was to be returned by the State. Your superintendent was sent
south and spent six weeks investigating the condition of the people
in need of assistance and distributing relief. We have just learned
that the money will not be returned to Mr. Spreckels, as, for some
reason, the Governor refused to approve the bill passed by the Leg
islature providing for its payment. I am pleased to state, how
ever, that the commission has received a letter from Mr. Spreckels
donating all the money thus far expended by the commission and
directing that all the notes given by the farmers in the stricken
community for sums advanced be returned to them with his com
pliments."
OX the first page of The Call <>f
December 20, 1898, appears a
statement of the advance of $2f>,
--000 to the State by Mr. Claus
Spreckels, to relieve sufferers by
the drought in Monterey and San Luis
Obispo counties. The head lines over
the statement read:

Then followed this statement:
3 Plans were devised and put into o
s> effect yesterday that will afford <$>
0 ample and immediate relief for the o
) <>.< stitute farmers in Monterey and <?>
3 S;m Luis Obispo counties. In The O
â¢' Call of last Sunday statements <$>
? were published describing the ex- O
J> tent and nature of the destitution â¦
Â£ in that region. The intelligence O
% conveyed to The Call was at the *
~ same time placed before Governor Â°
* Hudd, who announced at once that ***
â¢> prompt measures would be taken O
$> to provide temporary relief and <?>
0 bridge over the distress until the O
?> Legislature convened. <$>
D Yesterday a representative of 6
Â» this paper waited on Governor <â¦>
0 Hudd a.nd referred to the fact that O
e> at one time in the history of the <?>
3 State, when no public money was O
* immediately available for the sup-
j> port of one of the State institu- O
tions, Charles Crocker advanced %
t from his own means the sum of 9
$50,000, and was subsequently reim-
1 bursed by the State through ac- X
3 tion of the Legislature. The Gov- T
p ernor remarked that there might %
3 be some difficulty at this time in q
t> finding a man so generous and <Â«>
3 public-spirited as to advance the o
Â£ money needed to alleviate the dis- <$>
3 tress in the counties mentioned, o
Â» The representative of The Call <g>
3 suggested that the Governor go O
jÂ» with him and present the case to <$>
0 Claus Spreckels. The suggestion q
is was readily accepted, and they <*,
3 called on Mr. Spreckels, who lis- o
tened with close attention to the ,
2> Governor's statement of the situ- %
q> ;ition, and then, without hesita- %
0 tion, Mr. Spreckels proffered his A
S> check for $50.iÂ«0.
O Governor Budd had no thought q
Â§ of suggesting a greater sum than <j>
b $25,000, hence he was surprised and o
"> gratified beyond measure at Mr.
O Spreckels' prompt and generous O
response. The Governor, upon re- <$>
flection, decided that one-half of o
~- v the amount named by Mr. Spreck- <$>
9 els would be sufficient to meet the 6
Â¥ urgent necessities of the situation. 4>
? "Very good." remarked Mr. O
o Spreckels, "we will make the 4>
check for $25.(K.<0, with the assur- O
O ance that if $25,000 more is required <Â«>
you can have it."
O The Governor, desiring that Mr. Â£
6> Spreckels should clearly compre- *r
o hend the case, explained that the *
question of reimbursement would O
* rest wholly with the Legislature. <$>
7 The latter manifested no uneasl- O
ness on that score. He said he had
9 given away larger sums than that o
X and if the amount should not be v
Z, repaid he could get along very well O
n without it. He said he was taking *
Â£ care of fifty families in that re- O
O gion and had already advanced 4Â»
<h $50,000 to the farmers of that lo- O
O eallty, which would be repaid, he
>â¦> fancied, when they were favored %
-_ with good crops.
â¢5> The whole question of affording 9
O relief to those in need of assist- <J>
3> ance is now disposed of until the o
O Legislature sees nt to make an
<Â£ appropriation of public money. Â«
O The relief can be quietly and
â¦ speedily afforded in a systematic "
O and methodical manner. There V
Q> will be no occasion for printing a r
O picture of every person obtaining X
help, together with his name and ,
O biography. A sack of flour may be JJ
,^> Bent to a family in need of it, and Â°
o illustration of the family tree will â¦
â . rot be required as a condition of O
Â£ rcllof. <?>
Now that all the money needed o
q has been secured there will be no <$>
*> excuse for importuning merchants O
q of the city every hour of the day <J>
.-, to contribute either cash or mer- O
q chandise. Should Governor Budd â¦
find the sum of $25,000 inadequate he O
O can go to Claus Spreckels and get 3*
$> $25,000 more. There will be noth- O
O ing to justify any individual or â¦
;â¢> any community in organizing: a 9
6 begging expedition to visit the *
$> Eastern cities of the country. The 9.
o great and rich St.itt- of California y
â¢â  will amply provide clothing, sub- y
O sistenco and seed for the dis- '?
â¢ trussed farmers. The greatest dan- V
O ger now confronting the State is q'
3> that an army of beggars will take %
Â° the field and in the name of starv- _
â¦ ing humanity seek to collect Â°
money for needy farmera. O
" When the Legislature convenes <Â«>
Â£ there will be in the State treasury o
g the sum of $4.0T0,000. At present <*>
q the amount exceeds $2,000,000, but O
X it cannot be appropriated for any <$>
q use until an uct of the Legislature O
X authorizes an appropriation. The <Â«>
o Governor, observing that the State O
<Â£> has appropriated more than $1,000,- <â¢Â»
O 000 for the support of agricultural O
a fairs, in which horseracing is the <$>
1. chief feature of the rural display, o
*r contends that there is ample au- <j>
<v thority to use the public funds to ~
O relieve actual distress among the V
<Â£ farmers. He is confident that one %
O of the iirst acts of the incoming 9
â¢$ Legislature will be the enactment '
O of a measure to reimburse Claus 9
â¢*â  Spreckels for the money advanced Â£
O on the credit of the State to help 9
<*> the distressed farmers of Monte- q
O rey and San Luis Obispo counties. 9
* When Governor Budd went to A
9 Mr. Dohrmann's place of business <J>
* yesterday to ask Mr. Dohrmann q
0 to serve on the committee, he <Â£
Â£ found a solicitor there importun- A
Â° ing the merchant for a relief con- a,
1 tribution. The Governor put an q
9 end to the soliciting negotiation by <Â§>
;l the prompt remark: "There is no q
need. Mr. Dohrmann, of making <*>
1 any contributions to this cause. I o
a, am the Governor of the State; I
q understand the situation and am o
a in a position to take care of the <s>
JT distressed farmers. The great o
Â° State of California is not asking or V
<v authorizing any one to solicit re- **
O lief. All the money needed is Â°
t raised, and what I desire now is a
O proper and timely distribution of O
<$> the funds at my command."
O The Governor's interruption up- O
<$> set the solicitor, but gratified Mr.
O Dohrmann. Doubtless many other O
<Â£ merchants were interviewed *yes- ***
O terday and urged to get in and y
<J> give something to somebody. %
9 The sentiment of the mercantile 9
* community i\a expressed yester-
O day after the fact was made *
* known that Mr. Spreckels had ad- 9
O vanced money to afford ample re-
X lief was to the effect that no fur- t
o ther mention of the distress
* should be publicly made. The Â°
O point was raised that the distress "*>
<s> was confined to a small section of O
O the State and was not in the na- <^
<Â§> ture of a calamity which the o
q whole world was invited to con- <Â§>
<^> template, but on the other hand o
O was a little family affair, which <$âº
,^> concerned Californians only, and o
O which the State was able to take â &
<^ care of. It was suggested that no O
6 further reference should be made <&
<â¢> to the subject until the committee O
O was able to render a report of the <$>
<& distribution of the relief funds. O
The bill to reimburse Mr. Spreckels
for this advance passed both houses of
the Legislature, and on March 20. be
ing still in the hands of the Governor
waiting his approval, correspondence
by wire and mail took place between
him and the president of the relief com
mission, which is explained in the fol
lowing letter:

O man. The work of ascertaining
* the actual wants of the sufferers *-.
Â° and distributing relief throughout Â°
â¦ the distressed district was per- <%
O formed gratuitously by the Mer- 9.
Â®> chants' Association through its '
O superintendent and his assistant. 9
<& These gentlemen visited all parts ">
O of the afflicted territory and re- 9"
$> lieved the actual want of the â¢
O sufferers to the extent of supply- O
â¦ Ing feed for their famishing â¦
O stock and provisions and modi- O
<?> cine wherever needed. As a re- J
O suit of this work of distribution' f
<*> a balance of nearly half the- sum
O remains unexpended.
Since then, on account of the
O continued drought, only lately re- \
Â® lieved by rain, many additional 'â¢*
O cases of suffering, as well as re- c
<8> newed applications of those al- /i -
O ready temporarily relieved, have Â°
â $> been accumulating to such an ex- *
O tent that this commission, though ~
<*> having accomplished its primary '
O work, would gladly extend fur-
jÂ» ther relief, for which the balance
Â° available will barely sufllce. Â°
3* Under these circumstance s, anrt &
O without at any time conferring <*
â¦ with Mr. <"lavs Spreckels regard- '
O ing his wishes in the matter, the <
<$> commission was anxious to know <
O the final result of the bill passed '
<Â§> by the Legislature for refunding
O this money. Jf the bill became a
<Â§> law the commission would then,
O of course, feel in duty bound to
<Â§> extend the relief asked for to the
O extent of the balance of the fund.
<?> If it did not become a law the
O commission would feel bound to
<J> ascertain from Mr. Claus Spreck- -
O els whether he desired to donate <
<s> the whole amount advanced by
O him, or to have the balance re- C
<i> turned and otherwise disposed of, â¦
O which would enable the commis- C
<^ slon to complete its duties and be <â¢
O relieved from further responsl- O
<?> billty. â¦>
O Neither In sending its telegram C
<S> nor in presenting the above facts â¦
O does this commission presume to O
<$> urge upon your Excellency what '^
O course to take regarding the bill O
<Â«> In question, but it hopes that you <3>
O will consider its request for an O
<s> early, decision funy justified by <$
O the circumstances. O
<$> Assuming that the above expla- â¦
O nation makes it unnecessary to o
<$> answer questions pertaining to re- <â¢>
O ported donations of other parties, O
<Â§> or publish versions of the 4
O transactions between ex-Governor O
<$> Budd and Mr. Claus Spreckels, 'â¦>
O for which the commission is not <?>
a responsible. I remain, respectfully O
O jours, P. W. DOHR.MANN, *>
<6> Chairman Relief Convmittee. O
Instead of donating $5000, as stated
by Governor Gage, the Examiner, a?
shown by the record, subscribed S2oO
and was promoting a begging expedi
tion from store to store to raise a fund.
The Governor's incautious statement'
as to the advance made by Mr. Spreck.
els is sufficiently answered by the fore
going.
Emergencies by flood, fire and famin'
occur often, and the attitude of th
Governor toward those who suffer by
them and whose relief is a matter o J
public policy and of official concern
ivill require much explanation, mas
much as it is understood he killed th<
ippropriation for drought relief for rea
sons other than those given to Mr.
Dohrmann.

Charles Crocker for money advanced
by him for the maintenance of San
3uentin Prison in ISSS, referred to in
