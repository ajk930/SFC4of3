MANILA, Feb. 9.â The First Tennessee
Infantry has been sent on the transport St.
Paul to reinforce General Miller at Hoilo. It
is judged from this there has been a deter
mined effort on the part of the Americans to
land and take the city.
.-' MANILA, Feb. 9.â The Fili
pinos at Caloocan opened fire
last evening just before midnight
upon the Kansas outposts on the
.extreme left of the American line.
They maintained a fusillade of
. musketry, supplemented by an
occasional shot from two big
guns, for about twenty minutes.
The Americans did not reply.
MANILA, Feb. 8. â Last
â¢ evening, as the Filipinos at Ca
loocan were evidently massing
â¢ for a night attack upon the
American left wing, the Twenti
eth Kansas Infantry was ordered
.to attack and drive the sharp
shooters from a bamboo jungle
â¢ in front of the firing line, where
. they had caused considerable an
noyance all the afternoon. The
battalion charged brilliantly,
driving the enemy like chaff and
penetrating to the very heart of
â¢ Caloocan.
. First Lieutenant A. C. Alford,
as cabled* last night, was killed
while leading his company. He
I was shot in the forehead.
Sergeant Jay Sheldon, Com

VICTORIA, B. C. Feb. B.â
According to mail advices
brought by the â  steamship
Empress of China the Filipinos
were making every preparation
when she left â  the Orient to
fight the Americans at Iloilo. '
Armed natives- were pouring
into the town in a steady
stream and schooners crowded
with men were daily entering
the river. They were not being
interrupted when the liner left.
A sensation was caused among
the fleet on January 12 by a
report that the Spanish gunboat
El Cano had landed 3000 stand
of arms for the rebels.
Day and night the Filipinos
continued to prepare for lively
resistance and every hour of
the day was made to count in
throwing up works and barri

has been placed in the Govern

principal houses, and it was
threatened that if the Fili

be burned.
Although there were only
about 2500 Filipino soldiers in
Iloilo there were at least 30,000
natives in the suburbs awaiting
the call to arms. Ten thousand
of these were Montanos, armed
with spears and knives, and the
others were mixed tribes from

BRISBANE, Queensland (Australia), I
Jan. 16.â One of the most mysterious |
and horrible crimes of the century, in j
any part of â  the world, when all its ;
ghastly features of outrage, mutilated j
bodies, unspeakable acts and the mur- j
der of the victims are considered, was
committed on the night of Christmas in
one of the most highly civilized colonies
of Australasia. The criminals have not ;
as yet been apprehended. It was a tri
ple murder, and the victims were a
brother and two sisters.
The scene of the crime was within a
short distance of the quiet little town
ship of Gatton, a farming center on the
Southern and Western Railway,;sixty
one miles from Brisbane, the capital of
the colony of Queensland.
â¢ The circumstances surrounding the
tragedy are of a horrible nature. It ap
pears that the â¢ victims Michael -Mur
phy, aged twenty-nine years, and his
two sisters, Nora and Ellen, aged twen
ty-seven and eighteen years respective
ly, left their home,. situated on Black
fellows Creek, about , seven miles from
Gatton, early in the evening of Christ
mas Monday to attend a . dance that
had been arranged for in, the township.
Upon reaching Gatton it was found
that on account of the promoters being
unable to procure musicians, the func
tion had lapsed. 77
THE THREE VICTIMS
* NORA MURPHY.
After remaining in Gatton for some
little time, chatting with friends, the
three started for home again in their
dogcart. About a mile and a half from
the township they passed the local ser
geant of police. At that time they were
on a standstil 1 caking to their broth
er, who was on his way. home to the
agricultural college. The young people,
however, did not reach their home, and
on the following morning/the parents
becoming alarmed, one, of the brothers
in-law was sent to town jto make in
quiries. * : . . - .X:7Xxyy.
When about- three mles from Gatton
the brother-in-law | noticed the tracks
of a vehicle leading in 'through slip
rails to an eighty-acre paddock or field.
Knowing that it was a most unusual
SIMPSON TACKLES STRATTON'S PRIM ARY ELECTION LAW BILL
thing for a vehicle to enter the paddock,
he carefully examined the. tracks, with
the result that "he came to the conclu
sion that they, had been 'made by the
trap in which the' .young* people had
been riding. Following the track's "for
about half a mile, he made a ghastly
and sickening discovery. On the side
of a spur, thinly timbered and dry-look
ing, he found - the dead bodies "of the
three young people who had left their
home the previous evening,' all in good
health and spirits. â  ...
The spectacle â¢ that the corpses pre
sented was a horrible one.* All three
had their skulls broken in. Nora, who
was found lying on a rug just at the
foot of a large gum tree, had a hames'
strap tied tightly around* her throat,
and. as , a result of blows across the
head portions of her brains were pro
truding. Subsequent' examination
showed that the . lower portion of the

body was badly scratched and bruised,
suggesting that a severe struggle had
ensued between the girl and her mur
derer or â¢ murderers. Further evidence
pointing to the same fact' was found in
the condition of her clothes, which were
badly torn and pulled about. The bodies
of Michael and the younger sister were
lying together some six or seven yards
away from that of Nora. '-' Michael and
Ellen were found lying back to back,
but Nora was lying face downward.
Both girls had their hands tied behind
their backs with handkerchiefs. ,'. i The
horse, .with a bullet wound In its head,
was lying dead between the shafts of
the dogcart. â '..' X
The matter was reported to the police,
and the bodies were subsequently taken
to Gatton. The new of the tragedy
spread like wildfire through the sur
rounding country, and during the day
large numbers visited the paddock in
which the bodies were discovered. Had
the police taken proper steps, : however,
this would not have been allowed, and
the officers are as harshly criticized by
the colonial press as the law of libel in
the English colonies permit. The pad
dock, which is heavily timbered, is an
excellent one for tracking purposes, the
I soil* being fairly soft, and the ground
j well covered with small sticks and dry
j leaves. The traffic which has been al
-1 lowed through the paddock, however,
i has, to" a large extent, obliterated the
| tracks left "by/ the murderers.
Owing to Tuesday being- a holiday
(two ..-days always being observed;* in!
these colonies for Christmas), it was
some time before , the news reached
Brisbane. The first news that had
reached Brisbane, however, was a tele
gram received about 1 . o'clock in the '
afternoon by Constable ' . Murphy, a
brother of the victims. At first. Con

been treated in a similar manner. Nora
in addition, was found to have an in

SIGNS OF A BREAK
IN THE DEADLOCK
EARLY NEXT WEEK
Burns and Grant Are Expected
to Give Up the Fight
as Useless.
GEN, BARNES' FRIENDS ARE JUBILANT
Timothy Guy Phelps and Van R. Paterson Are
Ready to Receive the Honor if the Stam
pede Should Be Headed Their Way,
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAC
RAMENTO, Feb. B.â S. Grant can
not win this Senatorial battle, neither
can D. M. Burns. It is not possible for
either candidate to advance more than
one "or two steps if, indeed, any ad
vance whatever can be made. A Re
publican Senator can be elected when
both agree to retire. The expression
of | this sentiment comes from every
section of California. Irving M. Scott,
who has been here several times and
made a thorough study of the situation;
has about concluded that he cannot
break the deadlock, and he Is not sure
that if the lock were broken that the
scattered forces would come to him in
any considerable | numbers. 7.2. Taking
this view of the outlook, he may de
cide to give no further consideration to
the Senatorship. ,'..,. .
. Influences have been brought to bear
to bring Van R. Paterson' into the field
again. Word Is given out that he would
be able' to enlist the support of several
Democratic members of the Legisla
ture, provided the Republicans -would
bring him somewhat near. the winning
mark. There j is a "story in circulation
to-night to the effect that 1 Senator Tay
lor of Alameda and Assemblyman La
Baree sympathize with the aspirations
of Mr. Paterson and. would be among
the first to accord him their support
provided he should consent. to re-enter
the race.
Indications to-night point to a break
in the deadlock early next week. Grant
comprehends that he cannot win the
Senatorship this trip, and would con
sent to the support of some Republican
other than D. M. Burns. The Grant
forces, however, will remain, firm as
long as Burns is in the field. The
"colonel" is said to be willing to con
cede anything for the election of a
United States Senator except the elec
tion of Grant. !â .-.'
The failure of the Grant-Perkins
scheme, to bring Senators Stratton and
Taylor and Assemblyman Knowland
Into line, has proved a great disap
pointment to the friends of the San
Diego candidate. Moreover, the Ala
meda legislators are incensed at the re
peated suggestion that they could be
managed and shifted by the plots and
tricks of i politicians. Senator Stratton
resents the assertion of the Grant
boomers that he is ready to .desert the
Standard of General . Barnes.
. Colonel John P. Jackson. Collector of
the Port of San Francisco, arrived to
night and immediately sought the
apartments of Grant in the Golden
Eagle Hotel. He was promptly ushered
to the sick room of Milton Green.
Jackson and Green did politics for Sen
ator Perkins two years ago. The for
mer: received the fat" position of Col
lector of the Port, and to the latter de
scended the doubtful honor and heavy
burden of â¢ managing the campaign -of
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
U. S. Grant for the Senatorship. Sym
pathy for Grant, or sympathy for both
Green and Grant, calls the Collector to
Sacramento. Before he is here twenty
four hours he will find that Green has
a much better chance of going to jail
than Grant has of going to the Sen
ate. â¢-.^*"
There is talk to-night that Green will
go to jail, as he has made up his mind
that he will not answer the questions
propounded to him. The intimation is
broadly thrown out that such an ac
counting of the disbursement of money
as Green could give to the Assembly
under oath would not conform to the
accounting made to his principal who
supplied the money. The sum of $30,
--000 was mentioned in the testimony as
having been disbursed for Grant in the
various i legislative districts of Califor
nia, but aside from the amount paid
to Jilson and Wright, very . little is
known as to the disbursement. If the
San , Diego. bank managers were called
and compelled to>*.produce the accounts
kept with Grant th> expenditure of the
remaining $28,000 might be traced. The
theory is gaining strength that Green
is recalcitrant for his own protection
rather than for the protection of Grant.
In anticipation of a break from Grant
.and Burns there is talk to-night that
Timothy Guy Phelps of San Mateo and
Judge . Van R. Paterson of San Fran
cisco will have rods in position to catch
the lightning. Charles M. Leavy, for
merly of the Custom House of the me
tropolis, is said to be the advance agent
of Mr. Phelps. 7['.'i<"f
He is here taking observations of the
situation. Paterson was voted for
early in the contest and was therefore
once recognized as a Senatorial possi
bility. .
It is the judgment of many onlookers
to-night that General Barnes' prospects
were never brighter than they are now.
To-day and yesterday he received
many assurances, of support to be given
when the j lines of the contest are . re
adjusted. .- ;..
Many members of the Legislature are
making arrangements to leave Sacra
mento immediately after the joint bal
lot next Friday and remain' away until
Monday next. Several comittees have
planned to visit State institutions south
of Tehachapi. A pressure is exerted
this evening to induce legislators >to
postpone, .long-distance journeys until
the deadlock is broken. There is a gen
eral feeling that Important events are
impending and that the break from
Grant and Burns may come suddenly.
It is the desire of all the candidates
that their friends should be on the
scene of action when the events occur.
This -evening the signs point to a con
tinuation of the deadlock throughout
the present week, yet the members who
are planning to leave here next Friday
will want positive assurance before
leaving that nothing will be done to
disturb the existing situation while they
are absent.

; Wiard, a committee to call upon Mil
.ton J. Green, Mr. Grant's political man
; ager. to discover just how ill Mr. Green
â¢ has been.
.' Simultaneously with the appointment
'of the committee the Grant people
spread the report that Mr. Green had
decided to appear before the bar of the
Assembly and take . whatever dose that
body has mixed for him. : â¢
When the Grant people were closely
. questioned none of them would admit
â¢that Mr. Green had said this himself,
but they said they had heard it indi
rectly and were confident that he would
. be on hand.
Later in the day Green himself gave
.out the statement that he had decided
to come to the front, but he also said
he would again refuse to answer the
questions that have been put to him.
On that score, it is said, the commit
tee proposes to deal with him at some
length, and it proposes further to look
. into the rather startling disclosures
made yesterday on the floor of the As
.'â sembly by Jilson of Siskiyou, who, in
; the course of a general confession, said ,
the election of any other aspirant than
Grant gives some ground for the belief
.that the colonel and the statesman
from San Diego may agree to withdraw
in order that one more Senator may be
'added to the Republican membership
in the United States Senate. Word
'.comes from Washington that the Re
publicans there are anxious that the
California Republicans should find
.some acceptable candidate. It Is said
â that failure to elect will be charged to
.the Republican' State organization.

that Green had given him $400. to be
used In' the campaign and had asked
him to sign a contract to vote for U. S.

that Mr. Green had with him at the
time contracts signed by other mem
bers of the Assembly, and this matter,
one of the committee said to-day,
would probably be thoroughly investi
gated within the next few days.
When Mr. Jilson made that state
ment yesterday it was not in the ex
citement of the moment or anything
of the sort. He says he thought it was
a matter that should come out and he
is willing to stand by every statement
he made.
If the Grant people are expecting it
is a homeopathic dose that will be ad
ministered to Mr. Green when he
turns up on Friday, they are doomed to
disappointment,' if the present tenor of
the House goes for. aught. The state
ment sent out by him to-day that he
would appear but would persist in his
refusal to answer, questions served only
to make the feeling against him
stronger, although a majority of the
members are willing to wager to-night
that instead of Green there will come
another certificate of ill health. .

day informally to begin the work of
tabbing up its expense bill, and will
meet again to-morrow to complete that
end of its report. ' : __
to the fact that many of the bonds were
bald outside of the State, and others were
otherwise inaccessible. He therefore con
tended that it would be better to exempt
the bonds. The importance of the meas
ure was shown when he went on to ex
plain that should the bonds be exempted
the Interest would be decreased propor
tionately, the holder being released from
the burden of taxation, not a heavy one,
and the consequent reduction In the Inter
est on every bond would practically
amount to the tax, and more, and the loss
in taxes would be saved elsewhere.
The question of taxing the stock of na
tional banks in California was argued be
fore , the committee by Assemblyman
Muenter of Stockton, who introduced ..s
--sembly bill 250. Under present conditions
none of the property of national banks
except real estate Is taxed in this State,
while in the commercial banks practically
everything "but the stock is taxed. By tne
provisions of the bill the stock of*" the
national banks Is proposed for. taxation in
order to equalize matters between the dif
ferent institutions. Senator Wolfe sug
gested an amendment taxing all bank
stock, but this was not accepted and tne
bill was recommended for passage, as
passed by the Assembly.
Senator Braunhart's constitutional
amendment to allow the adoption of
amendments to charters and â¢ charters
themselves by a majority of the votes
cast for such amendment or charter, in
stead of a majority of all the votes cast
at that election, was recommended for
passage after a judicious use of the
pruning knife on the part of the com*
mlttee. ; ..
The proposition to allow an amendment
to a charter or a charter to be submitted
â¢ to the people on a petition of 15 per cent
of the voters at the last election was also
allowed.
Senator Luchsinger was turned down
with his bill to regulate the practice of
architects. He would have a commission
to look after the architects and "have a
license issued to each. Senator Smith de
clared himself opposed to such a meas

referred back without recommendation.

son, the matter came first and both sides
of the question were heard, after which a
general discussion took place, and for a
while It looked as though there might be
personal violence. ' A settlement was fin
ally reached when Assemblyman Conrey
suggested, that Instead of abolishing the
commission Immediately the abolishment
should not go into effect until January 1,
1900. This seemed to be satisfactory, . as
those wishing the continuance of the com-,
mission declared that the debt could be
paid before that time. The committee at
tached an amendment to the bill and re
ported favorably upon the measure.
A number of bills, of minor Importance
also came before the committee and were
acted upon. Owing. to a misunderstanding
the Stanford University bill will not come

cause the Federal Government cannot and
the' State Government has not passed

and the State laws are inadequate "to pro
tect any particular section from adjoining

a quarantine against any district â¢ where
Infection exists. They also ask that the

Johnson and Belshaw Indulge in an
8 Interesting Bout During the
- 5 Discussion The Sea
wall Bill.
* , CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb.* Americanism was given
-rent to in all its variety this afternoon in
the Assembly- chamber, -and not a little
personal spite was dragged into the pro
ceedings .and allowed* to ..blaze unchecked
for a 'time. . The promoters <of the after
noon's enjoyment were Belshaw. â  Johnson,
Fairweather-and Kenneally. Johnson and
Belshaw mixed. things in no mild, manner;
Fairweather mixed It with them â -, .both,
and Kenneally, whose bill precipitated
the row, made it his especial business to
keep things stirred up for as long as
either of the contestants had a punch left
In him. ' ,/-'. '"'-. 'â  ...
Assembly bill 393 was the cause of It all.
It was Introduced on the 21st of last
month by Mr. Kenneally, who really did
not know at the time how heavily it was
loaded. In fact, Mr. Kenneally did not find
out until to-day, and then he learned,
through listening to much glittering ora
tory on the subject, that his measure, if
passed, would bind the State of California
to an anti-Immigration policy more radi
cal than anything in that line that haÂ»
been attempted by the Federal Govern
ment. â¢"*,,-.* ...'â â¢ *
- In substance it provides that no person
shall be employed upon any public works'
being prosecuted by any city, city and
county, county or the State itself who is
not either a native-born Californian or
naturalized citizen. In other words, Mr.
Kenneally's * bill Is' designed to give the
man who lives 'in the 'State and partici
pates In its running expenses preference
over the foreign-born and unnaturalized
laborer, who has no other interest in the
State than the day's wage he can get out
of it. . .
Mr. Johnson explained the bill for Mr.
Kenneally when it came up on the file,
and he got a rise out of Assemblyman
_â¢ airweather of Fresno, who championed
the cause of the foreigner to a finish.
He said the foreigners might not partici
pate to so large an extent in tW State
taxation as the native born, but .no one
could deny that when there was -tar on
hand or the country was menaced that
these same foreigners came to the front j
in the country's defense as quickly as ! ,
any one else. Mr. - Fairweather found a I
second in Assemblyman Belshaw, who got i ,
into the debate with some heat. He said !
the bill waa vicious and un-American, and
that if the people of California did not
want to give the worthy foreigner a I
chance to earn his living after he got
here they should not invite him with j
open arms to the State. Then Belshaw
repeated that the bill was vicious and un- I
American, and Johnson got up to resent I
the imputation. Said he:
,_. "I do not understand .why the gentleman i Â«
from Contra Costa care* to "measure his
Americanism with mine. "It ts not perti- '
nent to the question, and if that is what |
he wants to do I suggest that we hire a '<
hall and charge $1 admission. We might
make some money, and we would cer
tainly provide some amusement. I deny '
that this bill is either un-American or vi- I
cious. It simply aims to give the native ;
born or naturalized citizen a chance to
work without suffering from the competi- i
tion of the class of foreign labor that Is j
overrunning this country. It is high time !
that some such law was enacted. I con
sider this a good one and hope it will
pass." Â** *â  â¢
The proposition to hire a hall was dis
pleasing to Mr. Belshaw, and he at- '
tempted to get the. floor to retort, but the I
privilege was gven to Dibble, who got up !
to -warmly second the measure. He said
he did not see why a distinction should
be made between the man who labors for
his living and the man who holds a pub
lic office. Every one who feeds at the
public crib and eats the 'State's taxes
should be a citizen of the State, whether
he sits in a public- office or works on a
county road. COwan denied that all pub
lic officers were citizens of the country.
He said, that arrival at Castle Garden,
New York, was ample reason for appoint
ment on the police force, and that as long
as the State allowed immigrants to come
in it should give them a chance to earn
a living. **
Belshaw got his chance here. ' He was
still considering the hall proposition, and
he had a score held over from earlier
days to settle with Johnson. He climbed
down from the desk upon which he was
perched and. said: -
"Mr. Speaker, the proposition of the
gentleman from Sacramento to hire a hall
is a good one, and I have often wished he
would follow it. I have become impressed
with the fact these last few days that
there is altogether too much Johnson on
the floor of this Assembly. The gentle
man seems to think that because he spent
a year or so in Congress he is the man
ager of this House, and that every man
on the floor of the Assembly is bound to
bend the knee to him. I. for. one, will
not bend the knee to him on any proposi
tion. I say that this bill is vicious, al
though I do believe in the restriction of
immigration, and if the Federal Govern
ment should draft a bill to stop It I would
vote for it if I had that privilege."
Then Johnson got back at Belshaw
again and read him a paternal lecture
that did not seem to set well on the Con
tra Costan's digestive apparatus. Some
thing was due at this time from Ken
neally, who had contented himself with
stirring up the Johnson oratory, and he
got up to vouchsafe the information that
"some of these fellows that come in here
| to work could not be dragged into citizen
i ship with a hawser fastened on to a tug
boat." His . speech was received with ap
-1 plause, and Assemblyman Brown of San
â  Mateo arose to offer an amendment to the
bill which exempted from Its provisions
I honorably discharged soldiers and sailors
| whether they were citizens or not. In
speaking in favor of the amendment,
Dibble took occasion to explain to Mr.
Fairweather, who interrupted him, that
when foreigners serve this country In the
army -or navy the honorable discharges
made them citizens at once: ; , no matter
how long they had lived in the country.
Then the amendment of Mr. Brown was
made the question, and it was adopted,
and Kenneally's bill, instead of being
passed, was sent back to the printer.'
Senator Braunhart's seawall bill was *
another matter of considerable discussion. '
It was passed yesterday, in the Senate, 'â 
j and came up to-day for second reading ln >
I the Assembly. -'.-"â¢â  * ,
!; Valentine,- chairman of the Ways and
i Means Committee, wanted the bill con-
I signed to that committee, but * Dibble
| strongly objected. He said it was an un
heard-of thing in parliamentary law . to j
deny a bill carrying a favorable recom- ]
mendation Its second reading. Valentine
Insisted upon his suggestion and the bill
was finally referred. *... Senator Braunhart
says it was done only aB a matter of reg
ular procedure and that he expects no
opposition. y yy' y v\-:y- y.* '
The establshing of the true line between
Mendocino and Trinity counties proved
to he a burning question. Mr. Sanford
of the former county had a. bill on the
file which fixed the line at the 40th degree
of longitude, but Assemblyman La Baree
of Trinity denied that the surveyor who
last laid out the line had got the circle !
in the right place. -In fact, he claimed,
through | Grove L. Johnson, that the sur- â¢
veyor, one -Rice, had got the line two
miles further south. Mr. Johnson thought
that a surveyor who could dally with lat
itude and longitude to the extent of set
ting the line two miles off â  its beat should
be encouraged by a favorable vote of the
Legislature.-but he -thought* nevertheless
that the bill, should be beaten. â¢â â â¢â â¢ ,..-* Â«-*_-: . ,

HER FORMER
ENEMIES PLEAD
FOR KAIULANI
HONOLULU, Feb. I.â Princess Kaiulani, the Flower of Hawaii, who
lost the throne of the island kingdom by the successful revolu
tionary movement of 1893, bids fair to -become a ward and pen
sioner of Uncle Sam, who has since fallen heir to the possessions
that in the regular course of events would have gone to the Prin
cess. Evidently stricken by qualms of conscience, the men who were
leaders in the movement which resulted in the establishment' of the re
public of Hawaii, and then in its annexation to the United States, are
now engaged in circulating a petition, addressed to the President and
Congress of the United States/ eloquently pleading Kalulani's cause.
It asks that the Government of the United States, in order to relieve
the Princess from all future pecuniary embarrassment, make a suita
ble settlement upon her. It recites her pitiful reconciliation and accept
ance of the changed order of things when thÂ» monarchy was overthrown,
her extremely friendly attitude toward the United States since the an
nexation of the republic, and that she is possessed of but a moderate
amount of this world's goods. ........ ...
*, 'The request for the settlement, the petitioners distinctly avow, is not
based on any alleged legal claim, and the memorial, it is further stated,
was prepared without the knowledge of the Princess or any of her
family.
Owing to the character and affiliations of the men whose names will
be attached to the petition, it Is believed here that it will meet early and
favorable consideration. The full text of the document is as follows:
THE PETITION.
To the President and Congress of the United States of America: The un
dersigned members of the Citizens' Committee of Safety of January, 1893: of
the Executive and Advisory Councils of the Provisional Government of .Ha
wall, and of the Executive Council, Council of State. Senate and House of
.Representatives of. the Republic of Hawaii, -respectfully present for your con
sideration. I ,*â¢*â¢ -' "*; /â¢*'_ ** _| ! â¢'-'" **t'W*"J' -'-*' *â¢ * 9.V0 â¢.-..* .->^."â-

Kaiulani, the daughter of the Hon. A. S. Gleghorn and the late Princess. Like
like, and the niece of the late King Kalakaua and ex-Queen Liliuokalani, was
and for several years prior thereto had been, abroad receiving her education,
she being then of the age of seventeen years.
That at the time of the said overthrow the said Kaiulani by law held the
title of Princess, and was the lawful successor and heir apparent to the throne
of Hawaii, to succeed Liliuokalani.
. That the said Kaiulani was not a party to, and had no connection directly
or indirectly, with the causes which led up to the said overthrow. of the mon
archy. Â» -'* 7 -'.-"â  â â 'â¢'.
That although the said Kaiulani was reared with the full expectation of
eventually occupying the throne of Hawaii, which expectation has failed
through no fault of her own, and for causes beyond her control, she be
came convinced soon after the overthrow of the monarchy that it was for
the best interests of her country and people that agitation against the re
public should cease. Acting upon this opinion she openly accepted the re
public and. the authority of its government, at a time long before annexa
tion was a certainty, ana at a time when an opposite course might have
caused agitation against the republic. -/ ; - . â '' -â *'.
.That from that time to the present the said Kaiulani has desisted from
countenancing opposition to the republic, although urged to do so by royalist
leaders, and has frankly and openly accepted and supported the republic, and
used her best efforts to assuage the enmities caused by the late political
changes ln Hawaii. *-'â â â â'
That although Americans and those of American descent have been
largely instrumental In bringing about the changes which have deprived the
said Kaiulani of her brilliant prospects, she bears no apparent animus against
them or their country, and has been conspicuous in earnest efforts, both
socially and otherwise, to forward American interests and to remove the pre
judices existing between the royalists and the supporters of annexation* As
an example of her conduct in this respect we would cite the fact that upon
the outbreak of the late Spanish war she volunteered her services and was
prominent in- the entertainment of the American soldiers passing through
Honolulu to Manila, and -became and still continues the vice president of the
local Red Cross Association, for the care of sick American soldiers in Hono
lulu, the president of such association being the wife of the American Min
ister. .--,â _ â¢ â¢ ...
That the said Kaiulani is possessed of but a limited amount of : property
and income. ... â  . . .*: Â - .. , Â-.
That we do not think or suggest that the said Kaiulani has any legal claim
against the United States Government; but we do offer for your consideration
whether or not, in view of the premises and of the circumstances attending
the change of government in Hawaii, the Government of the United States
would not be warranted in making a settlement upon the said Kaiulani- and
in this connection we beg to call to your attention that such settlement was
provided for in the annexation treaty negotiated by President Harrison
If such action is taken we believe that It will further and materially tend
to remove the remaining feeling growing out of annexation; will be -_ood
political policy: will be a graceful act toward a lady of character, who pos
sesses the esteem of- all who know her, and will be gratifying to the citizens
of Hawaii of all parties and nationalities. * *â _â â â¢- â â â <-â  -.luzens

IN JANUARY.
Two New Steamships to Be Put on
the Trans-Pacific Run by
. the British -Ameri
can Line.
HONOLULU, Feb. 1.-Four thousand-,
eight hundred shares of Onomea Sugar *
Company stock changed hands recently
at 137*_. C. Brewer and Castle & Cooke
were the sellers. Edward Pollitz was"
the buyer. The transaction is an evi
dence of the growing demand in San.
Francisco for the island sugar stocks.'
Mr. Pollitz. buys to sell again in San
Francisco and the certificates of stock
will be made out in blocks of suitable
size for that purpose. The transac
tion involves no change of management
or ownership. Brewer & Co. and Castle
& Cooke each owned an equal interest
in the plantation and alternated each,
year in the agency, Castle & Cooke be
ing the agents this year. Each cor
poration sold an equal amount of stock.
The two together will own a control.-,
ing interest and will not dispose of
more stock at any price. They will
continue to alternate in the agency. â¢
The plantation has always proved
profitable to its owners. Mr. Pollitz
came here to look for good sugar stock
to put on the San Francisco market to
meet the demand that has grown up:
there and which has been greatly stim
ulated by the Hawaiian Commercial:
deal recently made. He began negoti
ations through >,â¢ George R. Carter for
this Onomea stock. -* The deal was com
pleted before Mr. Pollitz sailed on tha
Coptic. .-.- ! : -.'.-.':â .-''.-* ' : \
The sellers are satisfied with the sale ;
they have made. The buyer feels that'
he has a good thing. Except for the-;
Hawaiian Commercial deal, this is the ;
biggest deal of the kind in island sugar .
stocks that has ever been' made. It
is the biggest deal ever made '.In the
islands. It amounts to $660,001) and is a.
cash transaction. ..*- '-'-"
January has been a record breaking
month on the Stock Exchange. ' By far;
the largest month's business it has
transacted since its organization was .
done. It is probable that it was^the-j-n
largest month's business in island se- 7
curities ever done in the islands. The
sales of the month aggregate practi
cally perhaps quite $1,000,000. ! Figured *.
at the lowest prices obtained the ag
gregate for which stock sold is $900,000.
The bonds sold aggregate $10,000.
With the tremendous activity and de
velopment of steamship lines between
the Pacific Coast and the Orient which
the war has precipitated, the traffic be
tween the coast and Australia has re
ceived an Impetus. Word now comes
through authentic sources that two
steamships ,of the Canadian-Australia
line are to be replaced' by larger and': *
better vessels. These two are therW-ar-'if;
rlmoo and the Miowera. They are to'
be replaced by the ' Rimutaka and tha
Tongariro, each vessel of 4000 tons,*-**
modern In model and in equipment.
Both belong to the New Zealand /Ship-:';
ping Company. They have large re- **
frigerator capacity so that it is evi
dent there is an intention to push the.
fresh meat and provision trade of the.
colonies into this new channel.
According to the plans of the British-
American line, the Garonne is only the
pioneer of a through line between "Se- .
attle and Australia in competition with
the Australian-Canadian line. The Ga
ronne is a British vessel and the capi
tal behind the line is largely British.

' Special Dispatch to The Call.
â '.:'. WASHINGTON, Feb. B.â Despite re
ports to the contrary no conclusion has
â¢been reached by the High Joint Com
! mission for giving Canada a seaport or
right of way on or from the Alaskan
â¢seacoast to the Canadian-Alaskan bor
der line. Numerous telegrams have

commission and. to others citing reports
that this Government might agree to

The question whether the Senate
â¢would ratify a treaty Incorporating a
provision for giving over any portion

â¢ Is. giving rise to no end of discussion.
*.--*. What the outcome of the whole oues
:.*.tion may be cannot be outlined, for
.-the reason that no final settlement is

authorities to-day surrendered James
Temple, [who has been In prison at Mag
â¢ dalena and Guaymas for tne last three
months, to Sheriff Leatherwood- of Tuc

NO MERCY IS
TO BE SHOWN
TO AGUINALDO
Otis Declines to Confer With
Him, and He Will Be
Treated as a Prisoner
of War When He
Is Caught.
NEW YORK, Feb. B.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Aguinaldo's revolution on
the Island of Luzon has received its
death blow, and the backbone of the
revolt on the island of Panay been
broken, either by the peaceful or forci
ble occupation of Hollo.
This is the Philippine situation as
viewed In administration circles. The
first conclusion is based upon dis
patches received this morning from
General Otis announcing that Aguin
aldo's Influence throughout the Manila
section of Luzon had been destroyed
and that the Insurgent leader had ap
plied for a cessation of hostilities and
a conference, which application Gen
eral Otis had declined to answer.
The second is based on the belief
that by this time General Mllller, in
command of the American troops at
Hollo, has received instructions â¢to at
tack and has commenced operations
against that city, and It is expected
that by Saturday dispatches will be
received at the War Department an
nouncing its occupation by the Ameri
can forces.
No instructions were sent to General
Otis to-day regarding his treatment of
the insurgents, and none beyond those
cabled several days ago and the gen
eral instructions under which he has
been acting will be forwarded. The
President has placed the conduct of
the campaign in the Philippines en
tirely in the hands of General Otis and
Rear Admiral Dewey. .
The action of General Otis in declin
ing to answer Aguinaldo's application
was undoubtedly due to his desire" not '
to recognize the self-appointed dictator
in any way nor to give him an oppor
tunity to treacherously reorganize his
forces and endeavor to re-establish his
authority. Aguinaldo will be required
to either surrender himself or he will
be captured by force if it is possible to
do so, but in the latter case he will un
doubtedly be treated more harshly than
he would if he were to deliver himself
up to the American troops.
With respect to his followers it is
stated by administration officials that
they will be compelled by General Otis
to lay down their arms and return to
their ordinary avocations.
Should Aguinaldo be captured the
President will give no instructions as
to his disposition unless General Otis
makes a recommendation, and if it
should be apparent that he will be a
disturbing element in the. Philippines it
Is probable that he will be brought to
the United States as a prisoner, of war
and held for a time in military con
finement.
As indicating the intention of the
administration not to send reinforce
ments to Manila, I was told to-day that
the quartermaster general had directed
the release from contract of the steam
ers Zealandia and Valencia, which are
now returning to San Francisco from
the Philippines.
On all sides unstinted praise Is heard
of General Otis and the officers . who
served under him during his brief but
exceedingly lively campaign. His work
and the work of his officers and men
has been effective In every instance and
apparently free from the many petty
complaints with which the department
was annoyed during the previous cam
paign. In every battle there have been
numerous Instances of personal hero
ism, and the Insurgent army was cut
to pieces with comparatively, small loss
to the Americans. In every engage
ment the superb fighting qualities of
the American soldiers have been dem
onstrated, to the surprise and dismay
of the Tagallos. *

FALLS FIGHTING
In Lieutenant Alford the Army
Loses One of Its Bravest -
Officers,
Lieutenant Alfred C. Alford. of the Twentieth Kansas Infantry, who
was killed by the Filipinos at Manila Tuesday, was' born at . Lawrence, -
Kansas, in 1875, and lived there until the time of his enlistment at the
breaking out of the war. \He was connected with
the Kansas National Guard for six years, enlisting
as a private in Company H when he was 18 years
old and rising to the rank of second lieutenant.
At the outbreak of the war, despite the fact that
Governor Leedy disbanded the National Guard. Com
pany H. largely through the influence of Alford and
the other officers of the organization, enlisted as a
company and was the best drilled and equipped of
any in the poorly outfitted regiment.. The first va
cancy among the first lieutenants of the regiment was
given to Alford on account of his recognized worth
as an officer. When the regiment left for Manila Lieu
tenant Alford was in temporary command of Com
pany B. but after reaching the Philippines he was
transferred to Company I. He was considered by his
superiors an exemplary officer, and commanded the
respect and confidence of his men.
Lieutenant Alford was a graduate from the Kan
sas State University, holding a bachelor's degree
from that institution. In 1897 he graduated from the law school and be
gan the practice of his chosen profession with his father, a prominent
lawyer of Lawrence. Alford was a young man of exemplary habits and
was generally .respected by the people of his native town. He leaves a
father, mother, three brothers and a sister to mourn his death.
I vanced post in the American line,
fully ten miles from the base of
supplies. It has an almost per
fect position. Four guns of the
Utah artillery stationed on a hill
behind the water works com
mand the valley to the right and
left and the foothills in front.
Two companies of the Colorado
regiment support the Twenty
third Infantry, which is en
camped at the reservoir three
miles to the rear. Outposts line
the ridge overlooking the valley,
while a sand bag entrenchment
with gun emplacements fronts
the river.
Yesterday the Utah Battery
dropped shells into the villages
across the river. The natives dis
appeared among the hills, the
main force retiring to the right
and the others scattering. Sub
sequently the Americans recon
noitered and found the village of
San Pedro completely deserted.
They did not burn ' it and to-day
the villagers returned in small
parties, bearing bamboos rto
which white flags were fastened.
They kept, : however, out of
range. Later, signal fires were
lighted along the ridge on the
other side of the valley.
The American troops are *in
excellent spirits and appear to
regard their experiences as a pic
nic, rather than a stern reality.
MURDERER AND
MUTILATED BY
THE FILIPINOS
THE LATE DR. HARRY A. YOTJTSTO.
Dr. Harry A. Young of the Utah battery, who, after having been captured
by the insurgents at Manila, was murdered and his body mutilated, had only
recently been appointed by. Governor Wells assistant surgeon of the Utah
battery, with the rank of sec_*hd lieutenant. '7 â  'Â'. 7 ' ~/7,_ /,.
Dr. Young was a son of the late Lorenzo D. Young and a nephew of the
late Brigham Young. His home In Salt Lake City was at the family resi
dence. 1079 Ninth East street. Dr. Young graduated. in medicine about four
years ago, and after taking a post graduate course at Johns Hopkins returned
to Salt Lake City to practice and met with success.
When the war broke out he enlisted in the artillery as private and was
later made quartermaster sergeant. He had a wide circle of friends in Salt
Lake City. â . .. ' â xxx[y7..^ i . .:;â :â . .
'. The part he took In the battle recalls the large number of the same family
â who served in the late war. They are Colonel Wlllard Young and Major Dick
Young, sons of Brigham Young; Captain Wash Young, Joe Young of Tor
rey's regiment, and Lester Young of Astpr's battery; Walter Clawson and
Will Young, with Caine's cavalry, who are grandsons; Harry and John, who
are nephews of Brigham Young. Five others enlisted, but were not accepted.

DISASTER NEAR YOKOHAMA
CRASHES INTO THE JAPANESE
WARSHIP AMAGI KAN. V "
Luckily the Damage Is Not Great,
Owing to Skillful Handling of
the Vessels at Close
. Quarters. â¢
Special Dispatch to Th. Call.
VICTORIA, Feb. 8..â News was
brought by the Empress of China of a
collision between the Pacific Mail
steamer City of Peking and .the; Japa
nese gunboat Amagi Kan, a terrible
catastrophe being narrowly averted.
The Peking was bound from Yokohama
to Kobe, when she encountered the
warship, which was steering a very er
ratic course. The officers of the mall
boat, seeing the Japanese vessel com
ing direct . toward their own, ran her
astern at full speed, but they were un
able to avoid the inevitable crash.
The Amagi Kan struck the Peking
right amidships, carrying, away a life
boat and about twenty feet of the rail
and indenting three of the plates. Luck
ily the plates were not cut through.
The blow was. a sliding one, thanks to
the skillful handling of the two ships
when within a few yards of each other.
The warship did not stop at all.
For a time it was feared that the
Peking was in immediate danger, and
orders were at once given for the boats
to be got out. The shock of the col
lision brought all. the passengers and
most of the crew on deck, and In a few
minutes all the boats' crews were at
their stations -'and everything was
ready for the lowering of the boats.
The City of Peking was able, however,
to proceed on her.: voyage to Hong
kong, where she was repaired.
The Empress of China brings news
of a still further misfortune which has
befallen the big freighter, Kinshls Ma
ru, out of Seattle for Japan ports. Two
days out from here on the last trip (she
left on December 28) she experienced
a gale, with mountainous seas. While
the crew was engaged In securing the
hatches five men were swept overboard
and drowned. Heavy seas carried away
a good portion of the ship's bulwarks
and companion ways. -
News comes from Kobe that five sail
ing vessels foundered during the gale
on January 25.
TWO TRAMPS STILL
HELD ON SUSPICION
May Not Be the Outlaws Who Fired
Upon the lone and Jack
son Stage.-"*-*"**-"
JACKSON, Feb. There were no
further developments to-day to connect
the two * i tramps arrested (on suspicion
yesterday with the attempt to hold up
the lone and Jackson stage. They are
still held in jail pending further investi
gation. The officials are not satisfied
that they are the right persons and the
search has been prosecuted to-day with,
unabated energy. -
Constable Kelly and Deputy Parker
of Jackson visited the scene of the
shooting to-day. Searching among the
high rocks close to where the shooting
occurred they discovered some , old
clothing and rags and an old sledge
hammer. The latter article is deemed
important.. It has a rough handle, and
therefore is not such an implement as
could be used for blacksmithing pur
poses. It ls more likely that it was
taken from a ranch. It weighs about
eight pounds. The officers hope to be
able to find where it was taken from.

Aged ex-Convict Escapes With, a
Light Sentence.
WOODLAND, Feb. B.â George Ross,
an old man past 50 years of age, was
given shelter by Mrs. Milton Enyart
Monday night. He disappeared during
the night, taking with him a set of
harness, which he sold. He was ap
prehended at Blacks and brought back
to Woodland. He waived time, pleaded
guilty, asking leniency on the ground
that he was hungry, had no money and
could not obtain employment. In view
of these extenuating circumstances the
court sentenced* the old man to thirty
days In the County. Jail.
Deputy Sheriff Hughes was at one
time , general overseer at Folsom State
Prison. When he went lo lock up the
prisoners In their cells he recognized
Ross as an ex-convict, who was re
leased about three years ago and who
has served more than one term on con
viction of burglary. His real name Is
Dc Witt Lynn. He is now congratu
lating himself upon having received
such a light sentence before the . fact
of his prior convictions became known.

IRELAND AND

CORRESPONDENTS.
It Is Positively Stated That the
Noted Prelate's Trip to Rome
Has Given Great Pleasure
to the Holy See.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 183*8, by James Gordon
Bennett.
ROME, Feb. B.â Archbishop Ireland
ls< the. man of the hour. Everybody 13
talking of him. Last Wednesday he
was received by the Pope. The inter
view lasted nearly an hour. Up to the
present Mgr. Ireland; has declined to
be . Interviewed, therefore anything re
ported as having taken place or a.
having been said during the reception
is pure imagination.
The Hotel Bristol, where Mgr. Ire
land is stopping, is besieged by a le
gion of reporters and correspondents,
whose one effort Is to ascertain whether
Americanism Is triumphing and whether
the Pope approves or condemns the
lofty, bold, liberal ideas of the Arch
bishop.
Another question is whether Mgr.
Ireland will represent America at the
disarmament conference. If we may
believe persons usually well Informed
nothing positive can be said on the sub
ject for some time. '.-â â "
What reporters and correspondents
have not been able to learn from the
mouth of Archbishop Ireland the Her
ald has succeeded in ascertaining.
"This." said a man in a position to
know, "ls the truth. All reports from
Rome and elsewhere about the alleged
discontent of the Vatican with Arch
bishop Ireland and all things related
as to a summons from the Pope to come
to Rome and explain his conduct have
proved . absolutely groundless. They
were inspired by his adversaries. Mgr.
Ireland came to Rome entirely of his
own volition, and ln doing so has given
the greatest pleasure to the Holy See.
He has been received most cordially by
the Pope, the Cardinal Secretary of
State, the Cardinal Prefect of the
Propaganda and other dignitaries.
What has been said at these audiences
Is not known. "'
"The Archbishop refuses to speak on
the subject, but it is made manifest in
many ways that he is persona gratis
slma to the church authorities, and the
Pope is disgusted and distressed at the
violent attacks made as soon as his
voyage to Rome became known."
CONVINCED BY LOUD'S
EARNEST ARGUMENT
WASHINGTON. Feb. Senator Per
kins to-day introduced an amendment to
the river and harbor bill increasing from
$184,000 4 to $214,000 * the , : appropriation for
work on the 'Sacramento River under the
Contract which the Secretary of War is
uthorized to make for carrying out the

giving hearings to Senators who - have
proposed . amendments to the river and
harbor bill as it came before the House.
California items will probably remain un
i - changed .excepting that relating to the
I Sacramento River.- . , ,
Congressman Burton, chairman of thÂ»
House Committee on Rivers and Harbors,
l speaking of the. appropriation for the re
! moval of Arch and Shag rocks, for which
| his bill makes provision, said: -
"This item would. not have been placed
I in' the bill but for the prompt action of
j Mr. Loud. The committee had discussed
j the advisability of making the appropria
tion, and had voted not to make it, when
it was decided,* as a matter of courtesy,
to call in Mr. Loud. His statement to the
[ committee was so clear and convincing,
i showing the absolute necessity for this
improvement, that the committee revised
Its action and placed the appropriation
in the bill. I had been strongly opposed
to the whole business, but Mr. Loud
changed my mind and the minds of the
committee by his strong reasoning and
earnest presentation of the case."

day morning, warned by public notices,
taken refuge In the ' Tivoli Hotel and
the London Mission Station, adjoining.
The tension was great all morning.
About 4 o'clock In the afternoon King
Tanu sought refuge In the Tivoli, and
about 4:30 p. m. a body of about 500
rebels made a rush from the western
side of the town toward the hotel. The
fighting had commenced. The German
Consul rode at their head, and Yon Bu
low was in actual command. The Chief
Justice and family, with others, then
left the hotel and sought the protection
of the mission station. British and
Americans had been warned to go there
as a place of refuge. The fighting was
severe in the. main streets. Advantage
was taken of the shelter of houses and
trees. Hearing the firing on the beach,
a party of rebels, 1000 strong, who had
taken up a position Inland of the Tivoli
about one and a quarter miles on the
main road across the island, advanced
in skirmishing order, after driving be
fore them a party of loyalists. Thou
sands of shots were fired, and for two
hours there was a stubborn . defense.
The loyal party by nightfall had been
driven within. a quarter of a mile of the
mission station, around which the bal
ance of : the loyalists had been com
pelled to retire. â¢ . If the two rebel par
ties had effected a junction the .loyal
ists would have been In a sorry plight
Indeed. Their position was bad enough,
but friendly darkness prevented it' be
ing worse." Samoans, like most air na
tive * races,- do not -fight in the dark
The rebels, having the loyalists, as they
thought, at their mercy when darkness
set in, contented themselves with de
sultory shooting throughout the night,
only to find in the morning that their
prey had escaped. . Under cover of night
the Malietoa people had sought refuge
in boats* laden -to. the gunwale under
the guns- of the Porpoise, and. they
could be seen huddled together as close
as could be right' alongside the warship

search, and' carried off everything that
they thought was the property of Sa
moans. Trees were cut down,' crops
were spoiled, dogs and horses taken
away, and boats either taken or de
stroyed. They did their best to dam
age the royal party and they succeeded
in doing irreparable harm.
In this extremity the Consuls and
the residents and the leading Mataafa
chiefs came to an agreement in order
to preserve life and property and keep
order. A provisional government,
with the President as executive head,
for. the above objects was approved by
all Consuls pending the settlement of
the whole question by their respective
Governments. The British and Ameri
can Consuls consented to this provis
ional agreement only on the under
standing that It. was in nowise to af
fect, the Berlin treaty, or any official,
or the powers of any officer under it,
and also that the Malletoa people who
had been in the .meantime taken on
board the warships to save them from
perishing of cold and hunger should
not In any way be' ill treated, but al
lowed to go to their homes, their arms
being retained on the Porpoise. To
this all parties concerned consented
and proclamations were issued notify
ing the people of the state of affairs.
The first act of the . provisional ' gov- j
ernment, however, again : showed the
fixed determination of the German offi
cials, both Consul and President, to as
sume an ascendency in Samoan affairs.
The action of the , provisional gov
ernment in deporting the Malletoa chief
to Mauons'and Mauua is in direct op
position to the agreement made with
the Consuls. . Sixty chiefs were sent to
Mauua, but, owing to bad weather,
could not fetch that Island. â¢ They went
Into Tutuila, however.-and there were
taken over by the Pago Pago people,
who have declared their adherence to
Malletoa. They tried to capture the
guard with the prisoners, * but the
schooner got -under, way too quickly.
Everything points to another fight
among the natives at no distant point.
Mataafa people are dissatisfied, at least
a portion of them, with the looting and
deportation of chiefs, and are now talk
ing, of uniting with the Malletoa fac
tion. *. â -??#:* â¢â¢ * :

- An epidemic of crime seems to pre
vail in .Australia at the present time
in the shape of murder and unmention
able offenses. â¢ . Not many miles .from
where the bodies of the 'Murphies were
found, the body of a young -.boy has
been discovered,'- foully murdered. Th?
boy disappeared from home two weeks
before, the Murphy tragedy, but his
body "was not found until after the
Murphy murder was known. The dis
covery of the boy's body Immediately
following the triple murder had the
effect of. terrorizing the whole .colony
and making a sensation throughout
Australia the like of which has never
been known before.
On December 10 last a boy named
Hill left home at Nundah on. horseback
for the purpose of visiting his aunt sev
eral miles away. He never reached his'
aunt's residence, as was ascertained
by his father, who went there on the
Wednesday following. The police were
communicated with, but their theory
was that the boy had run away. A
few days ago the boy's pony was found
dead near Oxley. Foul play was then
suspected, and search parties on Sat
urday found the boy's body much de
composed, with a bullet wound in the
head. The body was covered with
bushes. About four hundred yards
from this the body !of the pony was
found, it having been shot through the
head. The utmost' precautions were
taken not. to disturb the boy's body,
and the police were at once Informed.
A message was In the meantime sent
to Brisbane asking for the immediate
attendance of the Government medical
officer. The relatives of the missing
boy recognized the remains by the i
boots and whip which lay near. There j
was also a pair of trousers which had j
been rolled up and attached to the lad's |
saddle when he, left home. These were I
found lying on the ground. A very
large number of people endeavored to I
get to the spot, but the police prevented
them. The Hill boy was sixteen years I
old and very timid. After, a careful ex- j
amination the medical officer reports
that there Is no doubt but that the boy
was shot. When the body was discov
ered nothing was visible but the boots
and the bone of one-leg,- from which all
the flesh had disappeared.
Coming almost at the same time' as
the foregoing crimes In Queensland Is
a horror in the colony of Victoria as
full of mystery as the others. For
over three -weeks the Melbourne police
force has been endeavoring to discover
Identity of a woman whose remains
were " found In a trunk in the Yarra
River and who, it is now ascertained,
had consumed an Immense dose of
arsenic. The case is one of the many
mysteries confronting the Colonial po
lice at the present time. The remains
have been identified successively as
those of several young women, all of
whom have been found to be alive and
well. The crime, probably had to do
with some. medical malpractice, and It
is thought that there must have been
two or more persons cognizant of It.

this morning, and five hours later the fu

begin for the purpose of driving away the
! ness to the bank is variously estimated
at from $250,000 to $300,000â enough to
wreck any bank possessing the re- j
sources of the Wright concern. . But
while the inroads made on the bank's
funds by Howard undoubtedly were ,
the. direct cause of the failure, they
only hastened the Inevitable end of an
j institution which from the start has
! been conducted on false pretenses.
I. It now appears that the Building and j
j Loan Association of San Jose, which
l was organized by H. Ward Wright in â 
' 1885, and was always controlled by
i himself and members of his family, has :
! been used primarily as a feeder for the j
bank. The Wrights have been feeding j
from both ends of the trough, until
the building association itself, repre- j
senting the savings of thousands of j
people in moderate circumstances, was j
seriously menaced, and it may prove a
fortunate circumstance for the. share
holders in the loan association that I
the failure of the Union Savings Bank I
was not delayed for another year. The !
facts in the case are vouched for by
men of standing, who have had every
opportunity to become familiar with
the subject, some of whom formerly
held shares In the loan association, but
drew out when they saw how It was
being manipulated by the Wrights as
an adjunct to the banking institution
which is now awaiting liquidation at
the hands of a receiver. The story Is
best told in the language of a leading
attorney of this city, who knows
whereof he speaks. He says: .; >
"The San Jose Building and Loan
Association was organized in 1885 by
Ward Wright and a few associates.
The association prospered from the
start, and ' four years later Wright or
ganized the Union Savings Bank with
a capital of $200,000, of which- $50,000
was fully paid; up. The banking busi
ness under Wright's management also
prospered apparently, but this pros
perity was in a large measure assumed, i
for it is known that for years the funds \
of the building and loan association !
were used, to carry the bank. H. j
Ward Wright, as secretary, and W. H. i
Wright as treasurer, . of. the asso- j
ciation, : controlled its ; funds, which ;
were deposited in the Union Savings j
Bank, of which W. H. Wright was
manager. Frank Wright put In an ap- j
pearance in 1892 arid was elected sec
retary of the association, succeeding his j
brother. Ward. It was too good a. !
plum to be allowed to go outside the i
family as -the salary was and is $250 I
a month, and, of course, It would not j
do to have the management placed in i
the hands of a man who might want |
to transfer the funds to some other I
institution. .'."*.;':' '"â . .* V
'As an illustration of how the funds ;
of the association were tied up in the !
days of Its greatest prosperity, mem- I
bers applying to the secretary for loans |
on their 'shares were Informed, In a I
large number of Instances, that there j
were no funds 'available,- but that the |
bank would accept their shares in the j
building and loan association as se
curity and advance the money they !
were entitled to from the association.
Further, when the association was or
ganized the members were Informed ]
that the first' series ,* of shares would i
mature in seven years. .When the
time expired there was no money to â 
liquidate the claims of the members, I
and Instead of getting their money in I
seven years, they were compelled to
wait ten years. In fact, they were not
paid until about a year ago, and even j
then. Instead of getting cash, the mem- j
bers were. in most instances given *
promissory notes.
"Of late years the bank has not been
handling so much money belonging -to |
the association, for the simple reason ;

devils of bad luck and misfortune. For
many weeks the Chinese population had
been preparing for the event . and the
quarter wears a gay and picturesque ap
pearance. Along Washington street from
I that the membership is probably not
now much more than one-quarter what
it was a few years ago. Members have
been dropping out because they saw
how things were going, and did not
care to risk their savings in the hands
of those who had charge of the funds
of the association under conditions as
they existed. The shareholders have
i elected a new board of directors, and
they will, I am satisfied, soon place
the association on its feet. The $SOOO
I which the association had on deposit
;in the Union Savings Bank when it
j failed had no right to be there. It
i should have been in the hands of the
treasurer."
The new board of directors referred
to was elected at the annual meeting
of the shareholders last night, when
all but three of the old board were
dropped. Frank Wright expected to
control the . election as he had others
in the past, but he was out-maneu
vered. At this meeting several mem
bers complained of their inability to get
money due on matured shares, and de
manded the reason, but they could get
no satisfactory answer.
The adjourned meeting of the depos
i itors of the Union Savings Bank was
! held in Turn Verein Hall this morning.
The steering committee appointed at
< yesterday's meeting reported in favor
â¢of perfecting a permanent organiza
tion and also recommended the em
ployment of attorneys to look after
I their interests. The report was taken
i up by sections and adopted so far as
it. referred to organization. A perma
-1 nent organization was then effected by
. the erection of the following officers:
j President, C. W. Chiids; secretary, ! B.
;C. Rodrick; treasurer, San Jose Safe
| Deposit" of Savings Bank.
It was provided that only such funds
j as are collected shall be paid out by
| the treasurer on the order of the
i finance committee. The finance com
â¢ mittee consists of the /permanent of
! ficers and F. N. Britton, F. W. Porter,
j D. G. Hurlburt. E. T. Pettit and A. E.
i Holmes. The committee was instruct
ed to obtain all necessary, facts in re
lation to attorneys' fees and the mode
of -procedure which may be necessary
to secure the claims of the depositors
and report on Saturday morning, to
which time the meeting adjourned.
It is not thought by those familiar
with the methods of winding up the
affairs of a defunct bank that the
movement inaugurated by the deposit
ors will have the success expected, but
that better results will be obtained by
awaiting the action of properly con
stituted authorities. â¢ .â¢:..'*" _'â¢";'^

pass to-day. nor did any other* bill ap
propriating money for public buildings ex
cept that for Newport News, Va. Dock
ery,'Payne and others made a strong fight
and filibustered the entire afternoon. It
is believed that Speaker ' Reed instigated
their opposition, for it Is well known that
he has. never, favored, extravagant appro
priations for. those or any other purpose.
In the last Congress and first session of
this he refused to grant time for consid
eration of public building bills reported
by committee. . "' Finally, . however, the
Committee on Rules granted .two days
(yesterday and to-day)' for their â  consid
eration. Most of this time was consumed
in passing these measures through com
mittee of the wholeâ forty-four yesterday
and fifteen to-day. Tne remaining time
was spent in filibustering. The. only bill
that passed the House was that urged by
C.'-P. Huntington for, Newport News. V-
The failure to puss : the Oakland and
Stockton bills was a great disappointment
to Congressmen, Hilborn and De Vrles,
but they hope that an "omnibus" bill
carrying all these appropriations will yet
be passed. Chairman Mercer of the Pub
lic Buildings. and. Grounds Committee be
lieves he can get another day for.the con
sideration, of such an omnibus measure.
Senator Perkins and . Representative
Barlow will appear before, the Senate
Committee . on Commerce to-morrow and

RAILWAY EXTENSION
TO VAN LOAN.
â 
Nevada and California Company Be
gins Construction Beyond
Amadee.
REDDING, Feb. B.â Track laying has
been commenced on the extension north
ward of the Nevada and California Rail
road. The present terminus is Amadee, ln
Lassen County, and the route crosses the
great Madeline Plains. Van Loan,
about fifty-five miles north of Amadee, is
the objective point, for the present at
least. From Van Loan it is forty miles
to Alturas. the county seat of Modoc
County, and 105 miles to Lakeview. Or.
An order for 3000 tons of steel rails was
recently placed In the East, and part of
the order, has already been shipped to its
destination. The construction force is not
large at the outset, as about forty men
are at work. The roadbed for the most
part will be constructed with ease, as the.
entire. distance is over a gradient offering
no more obstacles than a level prairie.
The gap between Amadee and Van Loan
should be closed within fOur months at
least. Susanville, the county seat of Las
sen County, will not be touched nor af
fected by the extension.
This move of the Nevada and California
Railroad was hastened by the apprehen
sion that the McCloud River Railroad was
headed for the territory from which Re
no's narrow-gauge line draws Its entire
support. No inducements are held out by
the people north of Van Loan for the
narrow gauge to extend Its tracks Into
Oregon, as they have faith that an over
land road Is a possibility of the near fu
ture and they do not. care to see any ob
structions interposed.

The Appeal to the Supreme Court in
the Kilpatrick Case Will
Now Be With
drawn.
The Board of Education last evening
made a number of changes and reductions
in the salaries of Polytechnic teachers,
which were as follows:
Miss K. C. Fay. bookkeeping, to receive
$00 per month:. Miss B. T. Durkee, book
keeping, $75; Miss Lillie White, bookkeep
ing, $50; Miss B. B. Conway and Miss
Leila Richards, teachers of stenography,
$80 each; P. A. Esplna, penmanship, $75:
Miss E. Rademaker, bookkeeping, will
still be paid $90; Mrs. Spencer to teach the
class from the M*ssion High School the
Pitman system of shorthand, $SO.
These changes would save $135 per
month but for the fact of Mrs. Spencer's
employment as an extra teacher, which
makes a net gain of only $55 in the school.
The positions in the Polytechnic desig
nated as "head" or "assistant" teacher
in the bookkeeping department are abol
ished, the principal in future occupying
this exalted position. â ' \
The sewing class of Miss Cashman, in
tho Franklin grammar school, will be dis
continued,. and the, singing classes have
been cut out of the high schools.
For vacations the city, schools* will be
closed the last week of March and the
second week of October. I They will also
close this year June 16 and open July 31.
Lincoln Day will.be observed the 13th of
this month. .' .
The secretary of the board, was Instruct
ed Ito notify the Legislature now in ses
sion that it is the desire of the Board of
Education of San Francisco that some
provision be made for the relief of Pro
fessor J. C. Pelton, the founder of the
public school system of this State.
A .communication , was . received from
Treasurer Truman stating : that .he
understood that the board is clearly
under the Impression-, that, .the
School Department â¢ was entitled -to
one-half of $1,217,140. , He also stated
that it was a' question whether he could
pay any money to the teachers. who took
part of that $123,500 overpaid money with
out* deducting from their demands en the
Treasurer. the; amount Judge Seawell says
was illegally paid them. It was placed
on file. ' â¢ â¢-â¢_-;' 'â¢ * .'-' -' '
â¢ The. leave of absence. of Miss Fannie
Davis was extended to June 1, 1899.
The estimated monthly expenditures of
the â -â â â¢ department were given as follows:
Teachers* salaries. $84,000; â " janitors, S5000;
office and shop, $16,000; building. $5000;
supplies.! $2500; - printing. $300; finance,
$1300; rents. $700: extras, $1000. Total. $101,
--400. The January teachers' salaries are
in excess of the above $5500, and the office
and shop expenses of that month are In
an excess of $400.
â¢ The. Judiciary Committee recommended
that > no appear to the Supreme Court be
made In the ease of Katherine-Ball. as no
decision could possibly be reached during
the life of this board, and any decision
would.be of little or no value, as a prece
dent under, the New Charter, The com
mittee also recommended that the -appeal
in, the case of E. .C.* Kilpatrick.be dis
missed, as technically the accused did not
have a fair and I Impartial trial, because
the directors sitting in Judgment on Mm

conviction and , removal from his position
as principal of the Business Evening
School ; were so implicated in the charges
that an" acquittal of . KHpatrlck would
practically have- been a conviction of

this I agree with you in the following modifi
cations: I am advised that the law requires
the one-twelfth of . the amount available for
the fiscal year to be subject to your demands
for each month, and that the demands for that
month can only be paid out of that amount.
In other words, each month must take care of
itself both as to the demands and as to the
money available. . ' _ ___.*_ ---
. ThiA being the case. I am prepared to pro

by your board, not against what may remain
of the six-twelfths, as a lump sum. but the
demand for each month of the six as against
the one-twelfth available for the month in
which the demand accrued. If there is any
balance left in any one or more of the six
months it will require an order of the Board
of Supervisors to make any such balance avail
able for any subsequent month. This is the

Principal Kilpatrick expostulated with
Secretary Welch, but was forcibly told to

he was "in 'disrepute with the board -a.

the new teachers then pouring * Into the

Kilpatrick proved stubborn, and the
board tried more gentle methods. He was
asked to . "stand in with the boys.
Charges were made out 'against him, but
hurriedly withdrawn when he. threatened
to tell the Grand Jury some strong truths.
Finally he was dismissed from his posi
tionâ"sent to Hunters'. Point,", a phrase
known in the department for summarily
discharging a teacher. G. H. Foulks was

FUNDS FOR THE EXPOSITION.
WITH a commendable promptness and with an
energy which augurs well, for the future, the
committee in charge of the proposed Pacific
Exposition has set about the preliminary work of
providing funds for the undertaking. Appropriations
arc expected from the city, the State and the nation,
and it is to obtain these the efforts of the committee
are now directed.
' At the meeting on Wednesday it was decided to
â¢ask from the city $750,000, and from the State and the
â¢nation each $500,000. A special committee of seven
â¢was then appointed to draft an appropriation bill for
submission to the Legislature and to visit Sacramento
.and urge its passage. The active work of preparation
has therefore virtually begun, and upon the results to
be attained at Sacramento much of the success of the
â¢â¢.ntc-prise will depend.
â [.' The amount asked of the State is moderate when
â¢ the scope and the benefits of the enterprise are taken !
into consideration. It will be remembered the State ;
â¢ xt'sde an appropriation of $350,000 for a display at the
â¢World's Fair in Chicago and has never had occasion
to regret the expenditure. That money was sent out
of the State. The sum now applied for will be ex
. pended within the State. The display made at Chicago
. attracted people to California only indirectly. The dis
play to be made in San Francisco will attract people
from all parts of the world directly to California,
where they will perceive not only the products of the
industry of her people, but the marvelous resources
of the State and the opportunities afforded by all sec
tions to persons who are seeking homes or profitable
investments for capital.
Little argument will be needed to convince intelli
gent and progressive members of the Legislature of
the merits of the proposed exposition and the advis
abiity of making a liberal appropriation for it. In
fact, had a million been asked it would have been
none too much. The State can well afford to appro
priate $500,000 for an undertaking which will make
known her industrial and commercial possibilities
and create a wide demand for all the products of her
labor. Moreover, an appropriation of the amount re
quested will assure the enterprise and thus strengthen
the claim upon the General Government for an equal
amount. From whatever point of view considered,
â¢ the subject is one deserving favorable and prompt
-action on the part of the legislators, so that the great
. work may be pushed vigorously forward without
delay. ..',*:-
PATERNALISM GONE MAD.
AMONG the numerous paternal measures which !
have been introduced into the present Legis
lature with a view to regulating and control
ling the customs of the people and preserving and up- ;
holding their interests, none is quite so ridiculous
as a bill which passed the Assembly the other day by
the decisive vote of 45 to 20. This measure provides
for the regulation and control of the business â¢ of
horse-shoeing in California, and among other things
â¢it establishes a Board of Horseshoe Examiners and
confers upon them authority to certify all men who in
the blacksmithing business attempt to shoe horses. |
We have heard of boards to examine dentists,
doctors, engineers, druggists, etc., but never before
have we heard of the State establishing a board to
pass upon the qualifications of horseshoers. The
business of horse-shoeing of course is very impor
tant, but we venture to say that the annals of legisla
tion will be searched in vain for an instance in which
a State has actually interfered with the feet of its
beasts of burden.
If a board of examiners for the examination of
horseshoers is to be established, a large number of
other boards designed to pass upon the qualifications
of other artisans will follow as a matter of course.
For instance, we shall have boards to examine jour
nalists, stenographers, printers, bakers, street car
conductors, blacksmiths, carpenters, newsboys, real
' estate agents and the followers of other vocations who
are now left to prescribe their own qualifications.
Undoubtedly large numbers of journalists, printers,
bakers and newsboys are incompetent, and undoubt
edly a board to issue certificates to them would serve
â¢ the excellent purpose of shutting out of those occu
pations men and boys who have no business to be in
them.
From this prospect to that in which, every man who
â¢ .works at anything will have to hold a State certificate
or join the grand army of tramps it is but a step. If
paternalism is to continue on these lines there will
be but one way out of the difficulty, and that is to
place, everybody upon the State payroll and have the
work of the State done by Chinamen. We know large
numbers of people who would rejoice to see things
reduced to such an agreeable basis.
Now the Filipinos declare they were not prepared
for hostilities, and there seems no reason for doubt
ing this. However, they thought they were all ready.
SENATE BILL 386.
AMONG what may be termed the retaliatory
measures before the Legislature is the one
proposed by Senator Ashe to repeal the
statute of 1872, concerning actions for libel and
â¢ slander, the statute to be repealed requires that the
plaintiff in such actions shall put up a bond in the
sum of $500 precedent to the commencement of the
action.
The statute was originally passed to prevent the
bringing of merely wanton suits against newspapers,
with intent to only submit them to the costs of a
suit, no matter what might be the issue of a trial.
The statute of 1872 is not required at all for the
protection or restraint of the large city newspapers."
They are equipped with legal advice and the means
of defense, and recovery of their costs by suit on the
plaintiff's bond is a matter of minor importance. The
real protection afforded by the law is for the benefit
of the country press. As the law of libel stands, and
as it is interpreted by the courts, a newspaper fre
quently commits inadvertent libel, and a country
paper may be constantly subject to suit for. damages.
Even if a retraction is made, suit may be brought and
the paper compelled to make a costly defense, and
without this bond will have no recovery of the sums
paid out for jury fees, reporters' cOsts and other
expenses, even if it win.
With the statute of 1872 nullified, nine-tenths of
the country papers of California can be bankrupted
before the next Legislature meets.
We deprecate and thoroughly despise the license of
the press, taken advantage of too frequently for the
good name of journalism. But the great majority of
the newspapers render a distinct public service and
enlighten the community without corrupting public
opinion. When purely retaliatory laws are passed this
majority must suffer with the rest, and the final effect
will be to extend and multiply the number of noxious
journals, since men. of credit and standing will find
too much peril in following a business unprotected by
any law against vexatious suits. In every community
there are men who practice at the law by methods
which cause them to seek just such suits as will be
promoted when this bill removes from the plaintiff
ah financial responsibility, and the result will merely
encourage litigation and incumber court dockets with
causes that delay other and more legitimate busi
ness.
The law will not, by removing a legitimate protec
tion from legitimate journalism, in any way extend
protection to any one against illegitimate journalism.
The fact is that no justifiable suit for a newspaper
libel was ever prevented by the existence of the
statute of 1872. Its only effect has been to suppress
unjustifiable suits and make it possible for a decent
man, with property and credit, to publish a news
paper in this State. * '
We feel sure that when the country press is made
aware of the proposition to expose it to extinction
as legitimate enterprise, and leave it only an illegiti
mate and discreditable survival, it will unite in a pro
test against the Ashe bill.
A glance at the country press discloses in nearly
every paper a system of news correspondence from
remote parts of the county in which a paper is pub
lished. A lawyer can take any issue of such a paper
and find in it half a dozen instances of technical libel,
upon which a suit may be founded. Statements inno
cent in themselves, or intended as mere pleasantries,
01 a mistaken announcement of a birth, death or mar
riage, a loss or an acquisition of property, is the basis
j of a libel suit. True, the paper may always win in such
; a suit, but its costs, not being recoverable on a
1 plaintiff's bond, may in one year exhaust its property
resources and destroy it.
The Ashe bill should be entitled, '.'A bill for an act
to make it impossible for a responsible man to pub
lish a country newspaper in California."
For having beaten his infant child into insen
sibility, it being his fourth offense, a man has just
been sentenced to six months in jail, which is all
right as far as it goes. It does not go far enough by
forty-nine years and a half. The man really deserves
to be lashed to death, but unhappily such a course
must be reckoned impracticable.
A SETTLED PROPOSITION.
WHEN an idea thoroughly takes root in a
Legislature it is difficult to extirpate it. Some
one has wittily said that mortgages and weeds
are the two hardest things to get off' a ranch, but they
I are easily eradicated compared with an idea which
has become deeply imbedded in the Legislative Mind.
, Indeed, we often have had occasion to observe that
; no matter how great the obstacles to be overcome, nor
j how discouraging the prospect, the Legislative Mind
recurs with unfailing regularity to its pet jobs, al
ways with a determination to put them through.
Ever since the adoption of the constitution in 1879
the Legislature has been the constitution provi-
Legislature has been dissatisfied with the provi
sions which regulate its business. Scarcely a session
has adjourned without a proposition to amend of
some kind being submitted to the people. At first an
attempt was made to increase the pay of. the mem
bers; then to lengthen the sessions; then to enlarge
the perquisites. But finally the Legislative Mind
settled down to splitting the sessions into two parts,
and for about six years now the members have been
struggling to get some sort of an amendment adopted
which will put into force this' peculiar idea.
At the last election an amendment was submitted
providing that the Legislature should meet biennially
.t the last election an amendment was submitted
viding that the Legislature should meet biennially
as usual and sit for twenty-five days, during which
period bills might be introduced. Then an adjourn
ment was to be taken for thirty days, when the ses
sion might be resumed, but no bills introduced. The
idea was to give the members a vacation of thirty
days during give the members a vacation to thirty
: during which they could organize to jam
through the jobs agreed upon by the bosses. But the
promoter of the scheme could, not resist the tempta
tion to drag in a provision extending the sessions.
He placed the pay limit at seventy-five instead of
sixty days.
The amendment was voted down by the people, as
have been all others devoted to the same subject, by
an overwhelming majority. But this defeat â the last
daced the pay limit at seventy-five instead of
c amendment was voted down by the people, as
been all others devoted to the same subject, by
verwhelming majority. But this defeat â the last
of -a dozen has not quieted the Legislative Mind. The
other day Assemblyman Jilson introduced the same
amendment with the pay limit fixed at sixty days, as
at present. Evidently Mr. Jilson thinks the length
ened sessions defeated the proposition at the late
election. Evidently he thinks the split session idea
will go if only it can be divorced from the old job
of getting more pay for the members.
In this, however, he is mistaken. The history of
constitutional amendments since 1879 demonstrates
conclusively that the people will adopt nothing chang
ing the present legislative system. They have the
Legislature j tist exactly where they want it, and they
are patiently waiting for the Supreme Court to strip
>atiently waiting for the Supreme Court to strip
it of the little power which it still possesses. The
sooner Mr. Jilson drops the matter, therefore, the
better. The people will vote down any and all propo
sitions upon the subject. The fact that the Legisla
ture is constantly complaining of its constitutional
situation is enough for the people. They will see that
the complaints continue.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAUL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1899.
PUBLIC OPINION AND IMPERIALISM.
WHEN, as a mighty force in modern times,
Mr. .'.Webster' recognized "the. public opinion
of the civilized world," he referred to that
settled public opinion which is the product of reason
applied to fact by the educated human mind. It is
now three-quarters of a century since the indepen
dence of Greece was accomplished, arid, notwithstand
ing frauds and failures that have stained and .check
ered national life, that force has. increased in breadth
and intensity until it has become a prevailing in
fluence that neither despotism nor freedom can suc
cessfully defy. It has modified imperialism in Europe.
I', has substantially dedicated the North and -South
American continents, even including the Dominion of
Canada, to republicanism. It has created and main
tained the republic. of France. It has forced Austria,
Italy, Germany and Russia into recognition of the
common people. It has stripped Spain of her pos
sessions, one by one, until, isolated and tumultuous,
she is the sole representative in the civilized world of
the expiring throes of. medievalism.
Armies and navies, scientifically organized and
disciplined, have been proximate instrumentalities
through which the national transformations and ex
tensions of the nineteenth century have been largely
effected. Immigration, commerce, trade, steam, elec
tricity, the great inventions and developments of man,
have been powerful agencies in the irresistible march
of civilization. But penetrating, and in the ultimate
analysis controlling them all, the motor of progress
has been and is the" public opinion of. the civilized
world.
In the United States settled public opinion has been
the victor in every vital national controversy. It
struck the keynote for humanity in the Declaration
of Independence. It hardened the thirteen colonies,
hot and palpitating from the Revolutionary War, into
autonomous States and consolidated them into a con
stitutional union. It destroyed the slave trade. It
extirpated slavery. It swept into the sepulcher of
dead wrongs the last denial of pc.onal rights and of
equality before the law. It insured every citizen his
free soul and his free mind, restrained only for the
common good, and with his own consent. It made
nationality a fact, inspired by a living and eternal
sentiment. And all these unequaled achievements it
symbolized in our flag, waving from ocean to ocean
over forty-five States and a cemented Caucasian
Union.
It is this American public opinion, radiant with past
conquests and meeting new issues with confidence and
with judgment, emanating from intelligence, from
education and from principle, that will interpret the
treaty of Paris and settle the questions of imperialism
and of Asiatic annexation. Slowly forming, slowly
rising, slowly spreading, it will not be diverted into
revolutionary channels by falsehood, by. sophistry or
by treason. It will not be seduced by the dazzle of a
Roman dream or the splendor of a British example.
It will hold to. the model of the republic. It will not
substitute Confucius, the Koran, or the vile theories of
paganism for the American charter and for the elegy
of Washington, which was the birthright of a nation.
It will teach â it has taught â the Filipinos that our
flag is sacred alike at the seat of government and in
Manila, but it will not clasp them in the embrace of
American citizenship nor place the foot of American
sovereignty in their racial degradation and their
sweltering barbarism. It will search Asiatic seas and
the Asiatic continent and islands wherever commerce
offers reciprocal advantages. It will diffuse truth and
morality wherever ignorance solicits light and suffer
ing pleads for relief. But it will remain the American
republic, with its constitution unimpaired, multiplying
its own population, enriched by nourishing blood,
gathering wealth from its own resources and from the
involuntary contributions ot other lands, and execut
ing for the world the solemn trust that can never be
impaired until liberty itself is crucified.
WHERE LEGISLATION IS NEEDED.*
FROM the report made by the Senate investigat
ing committee on the construction of the ferry
depot it appears the Harbor Commissioners
were guilty of gross wrongs in the management of
the work, but are not liable to any punishment, nor
can the money they wasted be recovered by the
State.
The report points out that the Commissioners, in
stead of constructing the entire building out of the
$600,000 provided for that purpose, used $349,000 out
of the harbor improvement fund for the construction
of the foundation; that after letting contracts for the
erection of the building on that substructure for
$545,000 they admitted so many changes in the work
called for in the original specifications as to increase
the cost by upward of $145,000; that by reason of
these changes the State has suffered a heavy loss.
The committee does not make a close estimate of
the loss, and by way of explanation for not doing so
says: "We leave this wide margin because the com
mittee did not consider it to be its duty to trace
these figures down to a mathematical certainty, and
we could not see how any recovery can be had, or
anybody punished, in the premises."
The Call went over this subject some time ago and
made an exposure of many of the greater wrongs
and frauds committed in the construction of the
depot. The full extent of the waste of money of
course can never be known. The Senate committee
virtually confirms all that was published by The Call
at that time. In fact, the report of the committee
expressly states: "This commission seems to have
entirely, during the last years, ignored the law where
it suited its convenience to do so."
Here is certainly a complete showing of gross mal
feasance in office under circumstances which compel
intelligent and impartial men to suspect corruption
and dishonesty. Yet, with all the facts made public
by the investigations in The' Call, with all the evi
dence obtained by the official examination of the
Senate committee, the lame . and impotent conclu
sion is that nothing can be done to' vindicate justice
by either civil or criminal processes, by recovering
the wasted money for the State, or by inflicting a
wholesome penalty upon the offenders.
Such being the condition -of affairs, it is clear there
is needed, in our Penal Code some provision for the
punishment of officials who take it upon themselves
to ignore the laws where it suits their convenience.
One such lesson as we have had in this case should be
enough for any commonwealth. The Legislature
should not fail to profit by what has been taught.
There should be promptly enacted some statute which
will give the State a resource by which to do justice
if ever another set of officials wastes her money and
violates her laws. -

CONDITION IN THE COUNTRY
_____ .
CITY SALES FEW AND DECIDED
LY SMALL IN VALUE.
A Complete Beview of the Records,
New Building Contracts, Be
cent Sales and General
Notes.
There was little business of any value â 
transacted in the realty market during .
the past week. Sales were few and of mi- |
nor importance. It is expected, however, |
that during the coming week a decided !
change for the better will take place. Al- j
ready many transactions have been out
lined and negotiations are expected to be
cdmpleted within the next few days.
Notwithstanding the general improve
ment in city property after months of
continual business stagnation, progression
and improvement In the country seems to
have outdistanced entirely that of the
city. Outside sales are more frequent and
of greater value proportionately.
Building operations in the local market
are anything but extensive, there being
few contracts let and these of small value.

Harry Houston Would Shake His
Venerable Wife Now That
He Is of Age.
Harry Houston , some 21 years of age,
filed suit yesterday In which he requests
the court to annul his marriage to his
wife, Harriet E. Houston,' whom he mar
ried a year or so ago. Houston alleges
that when he married his wife he was a
youth of tender years and incapable of
legally taking a wife, while she had lived
something over 40 years. Houston claims
that he married his wife under fear of
great bodily harm, and threats of injury
to his character. She threatened to ex
pose him to all the world unless he mar
ried her, he alleges, and also stated that
she would deal with him in ways not al
lowed, by law. Fearful that he would get
the worst of It. he led his motherly bride
to the altar. Now he is of age and he
repudiates her and asks the court to legal
ly, allow him to do so.
Joseph Choate gives some very
pertinent advice to his brothers in
the law in next Sunday's Call.
OLD MEMORIES
NOT BITTER NOW.
How the war with Spain and its se
quel of battle with the savage natives
of the Philippines has wrought into a
common brotherhood the people of the
North and the South was never more
touchingly illustrated than by the ac
tion of George H. Thomas Post, G. a.
R., Monday night. At its regular meet
ing a motion prevailed that a commit
tee be appointed to draft resolutions of
respect and condolence on the death of
Colonel William C. Smith. This was a
course without precedent.
Colonel Smith had worn the gray, and
had fought in many a bloody engage
ment. Among them who had opposed
him then and. found him ever a valiant
and honorable foe were members of this
very post.' When he came here at the
head of the Tennessee regiment they
greeted him, they threw open their
doors to him, and with him exchanged
tales of the days when they had been
foes. With laughter and with tears,
but always with a fraternity unmarred
by memory, they exchanged stories of
campaigns now a part of history in
which there is no shame to either side,
and when he sailed they were at the
wharf to wish him godspeed.
Yet all this was personal, and the
Grand Army is hedged around, with re
strictive formalities. Even these the
character of the â  soldier swept aside,
and his one-time enemies, as they
would have done for one in their own
ranks, were ready to pay him the trib
ute the soldier living gives to the sol
dier dead. . The man who lays down
his life for his country deserves that
! the Stars and Stripes be draped about
j him, and upon bis distant grave friend
ship would lay a wreath.
The committee decided that an edito
rial published in The Call, and perhaps
hot devoid of sympathy, fully met the
unique requirements, and so adopted it
as its report. The editorial was as fol
lows:
Colonel smith of Tennessee.
Colonel William C. Smith, First Ten
nessee, died of apoplexy at the head of his
command on the firing line February 5.
OTIS,
i Such was the brief telegram which came
from Manila to announce the death of as
loyal a patriot and as royal a gentleman
as ever fought for principle or gave a
hand in friendship. Colonel Smith was a
soldier. In the days long gone he had
battled for the Confederacy, and he had
not laid down his arms until the leaders
of the Southern cause had given up hope.
How nearly right or how nearly wrong
he may have been matters nothing now.
It is enough to remember that when the
country needed him he was ready for the
call. He left his home, his lucrative busi
ness, and went to fight for the common
weal, making light of the burden of years,
thinking only of the honor of the land. .
Of all the volunteer officers who passed
through this city probably not another,
won so many friends. A person of digni
ty, gallant, modest, courage beaming from
his eye, the best homes gladly welcomed
him as a guest, and more than one vet
eran wearing the sign of the G. A. R.
broke bread with him gladly. For old
things had passed away, over all there
waved one flag, and among its noble de
fenders was this son of the Southâ this
chivalrous, gentle, broad-minded man, a
type Of citizenship of which the North and
the South may be proud.
There will be mourning in Tennessee
over this citizen, who freely gave his life,
and there will be mourning in California,
where he came as a stranger, and .whence
he departed â¢ respected and beloved.
The committee was composed of
Charles H. Blinn, who had formed an
intimacy here with Colonel Smith; W.
C. Watson, who had known him in
Tennessee, and A. J. Vining. These
are all veterans who saw hard service.
Animosity has vanished, dividing
lines have disappeared, and where the
brave are sleeping none asks what
cause they served in the years that
have gone.

M. H. Azhderian and Elsie Williams
Ask to Be Released.
* M. H. Azhderian and Elsie Williams,
convicted of having extorted several hun
dred dollars from Captain W. H. Nevills,
are getting tired of jail. Yesterday after
noon counsel representing both prisoners
appeared before Judge Cook and argued
motions to release their clients on ball
pending the appeal in their cases to the
Supreme Court. On behalf of both affi
davits were presented stating that their
health was in poor condition and that con
finement in the unsanitary jails was fast
ruining their health. After the reading
of the affidavits Judge Cook took the mat
ter under advisement until Friday.

GATHERED IN
BY MORELLITO

Unplaced.
SPENCER RODE THE WINNER
PETER THE SECOND FIRST OVER
THE HURDLES.
Arbaces the Medium of a Quiet â¢â¢Kill
ing"âO'Connell Won Again.
Four First Choices
Beaten.
The Tarpey stake, a handicap, over one
mile and _ furlong, was decided at ingle
side yesterday. Only four faced the
starter, with the muchly talked about
and queerly named What-Er Lou ruling
a stanch favorite in the betting*. Hi was
allotted top weightâ poundsâ and i
finished last. Piggott kept him in front
until a furlong from the wire, where he
lay down his arms. David Tenny now
blossomed forth as a probable winner,
when Spencer shook Morelllto up and the
brown colt downed Pat Dunne's sturdy
racer with comparative ease. Storm King
took the short end of the stake.
The balance of the sport was unevent
ful. Several good things were tried, and
In one Instance at least landed right side
up. O'Connell and Peter the Second were
the. only winning choices.
In the opening event at seven furlongs
: twelve maidens faced the barrier. Of the
big bunch Master Lee, St. Simonian and
Jasabel were quoted at the shortest odds. !
Florence Fink showed first to the stretch,
whore Arbaces, a 10 to 1 shot, piloted by
Plggott, took command, winning easily
from St. Simonlan. Master Lee finished |
in the show.
There was no beating O'Connell in the
'next run, also at seven furlongs. The j
old sprinter was a 3 to 5 chance, and
showed in fron**** from the jump. Im
pervious made a game effort to get to the I
leader, but Martin was compelled to be I
content with taking the place from
Guilder. Key del Tierra and Highland !
Pall were hoth scratched.
In the mile and a quarter hurdle handi
cap at least three of the starters were
probably trying. The crowd made the'
Corrigan entry. Tyro, favorite, and the 1
Longfellow gelding made a very good i
showing. Leading to the stretch, he was 1
there collared by Granger, and the pair.
.took the last hurdle head and head. At I
â¢th.is juncture McAuliffe brought Peter the '
'-Second up and outfooting both Tyro and
.: Granger won by a head. The latter I
â¢ snatched the, place from the Corrigan en- !
' try by a short head.
'.' . In the three furlong scramble thirteen j
youngsters sported silk, and the winner
â¢ got away from the talent. Mountebank,
-'Kitty Kelly and Merry Month were ac- '
. corded the most support, and but one of j
-the trio managed to get inside the money.
Kitty Kelly led to the stretch, where
'â¢'Skeets" Martin, on the Corrigan entry, :
. .St. Anthony, grauaiiy assumed the lead,
and at the wire led Morbid out a neck. i
. Kitty Kelly was a close third.

Track Notes.
Before the plynge came Florence Fink
was as good as 50 to 1 in the betting.
Ab Stemler was credited with quite a
clean-up over the win of Arbaces. Great
things were expected of the bay horse as
a two-year-old, but he went wrong. He is
a full brother to Diggs, .Sutton and Olin
thus.
Howard, the Australian plunger, did not
gamble so very extensively yesterday. Mr.
Howard bet two or three yards of paper
money on Storm King, Tuesday, and evi
dently concluded to rest up. 'Hohenzol
lern has recovered from his hard race
on that day, and will be a starter this,
afternoon. Storm King ran yesterday,
apparently good and fresh.
Saratoga will make a great bid for the
patronage of the public and horsemen
this year. On March 1 the following rich
stakes will close: Grand Union Hotel
stakes, double event of $10,000: Saratoga
Grand Prize, $5000 added; Citizens' and
Merchants' handicap, $5000; Fleischman
stake, $3000; Pepper stake. $3000; G. H.
Mumm & Co. handicap, $3000. Besides
there are numerous minor stakes to be
contended for, and the association looks
for a return of the olden days. For fur
ther particulars horsemen can address B.
A. Chilton, secretary.
The following are announced as the
probable starters in the California Oaks
at one mile and a furlong for three-year

WALLER THINKS
HE CAN WIN THE
"SIX-DAY" ALONE
Dees Not Want Out
side Pacing.
1
TRACK IS A RECORD-BREAKER
OTTO ZIEGLER JR. WILL RE
ENTER THE GAME.
Has Been Offered a Ten-Mile Match
With Gibsonâ Wants
a New Five-Mile
Record.
All day yesterday the bicycle racers
pursued their steady grind around the
oval track at the Mechanics' Pavilion, ln
training for the meet, which opens Sat
urday night. Charles Miller, the six-day
champion, was there at 9 in the morning,
accompanied by his wife, and rode until
noon., she meanwhile standing* within the
track and calling out to him now and
then as he passed the number of miles
he had ridden, time made on certain laps
when he sprinted, and also what the oth
ers were doing:. *.- .â _,.â *,.\x
"Dutch" Waller, the pride of the Acme
Club, Oakland, who gained a big reputa
tion by his riding in the East, refutes the
imputation of an evening- paper that he is
concocting a scfieme to . beat Champion
Miller by making a combination" with Bar
naby, Chapman and others. Waller states
that he can ride the legs off Miller sin
gle-footed, and would have done so in the
New York race which Miller won, but for
a bad fall on the last day.
Jay Eaton and Teddy Goodman, the
sprinters, put up some dashing rides in
practice in the afternoon and will give
McFarland and Stevens a "hot argument
in the tandem handicap Saturday night.
. The six-day men expect to cover from
400 to 500 miles the first 24 hours of their
race, which begins Sunday night. On this
track they say the first 100 miles will be
ridden in about _ hours 30 minutes, which
proves that the track is lightning fast.
They have got out of the notion that the
steep banks will bother them, and after
a few turns around the curves they all
pronounced them as perfect as could be
desired. >-s : xx
Charles Turville is expected to make a
great showing in the six-day and also in
the 24-hour race, which will be put on the
second week. He is in fine shape, and
can stand the grind as long as any of
them.
As at least six of the long-distance men
declare emphatically that they will each
Stay on their wheels after the event starts
until they are well ln the lead. It remains
to be seen which one will win this novel
wager. Waller and Turvllle are the most
likely candidates.
Otto Ziegler Jr. of San Jose, who won
three national championships at Denver
In 1594. is said to be quietly training, with
the idea of taking a few purses to him
self in the sprints. He has been offered a
ten-mile paced match with Harry Gibson,
of Cincinnati, now here, and may accept.
The return of Ziegler to the nath will be
welcomed by the local enthusiasts.
Michael continues to work out on the
park roads, besides doing indoor work at
the Olympic Club. He expects to make a
new five-mile mark in his record trial Sat
urday night.
Eddie Laid has been doing more train
ing than he has been given' credit for.
He takes to the park roads every morn
ing and rides two or three hours, and
also has several Indoor appliances at his
hotel for developing strength and endur
ance. Bald is always In fair condition,
anyway, and soon rounds Into form. His
appearance in record-breaking exhibitions
will draw a big crowd to the meet. Bald
is better acquainted here than any of the
other riders, and Is extremely popular.
W. L. Loos, chairman of the Associated
Clubs' racing board, will be the referee
of the meet, and Douglas White will prob
ably be starter. The Judges, timers and
other officials will be prominent local club
i men.
OLYMPICS AS HOSTS.

Wheelmen, returned yesterday on the
Moana after an absence of ten months.
Goddard expects to start for Greenland
or South Africa In about a fortnight. He

Offers to Take On Any Two of the
Middleweights on the Same
Night in San Fran

Special Dispatch to Th. Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. B.â "Kid" Mc-
Coy, the pugilist, arrived this morn
ing from Denver and registered at the
Van Nuys Annex, with his wife. Mc-
Coy, who outside of the ring Is known
as Norman Selby, and Mrs. Selby, In
tend to stay in Southern California for
a couple of months. Mr. and Mrs. Sel
by will visit San Diego before going
north. ', :.â .'â¢ ";â '
In connection with his proposed San
Francisco trip, McCoy to-day wrote to
Brady, his manager, to advise him that
he would take on any heavyweight who
would draw well, or any two middle
weights, on the same night for ten
rounds each. He thought that George
Green and "Jack" Bonner would make
a good pair. It is McCoy's intention to
fight in the heavyweight class, and he
thinks that his sojourn here will put
him into just the right condition to
train for the championship.*
As to the Sharkey fight, McCoy says
the decision was right. He believes he
overtrained before he met the sailor.
Many of the matches for which he had
trained since last March fell through,
but the hard work he had gone
through exhausted his vitality and he
was sick and in bed on the day he
signed articles for the Sharkey fight.
Nevertheless, McCoy thinks that he
might have put out the sailor in the
third round if the gong had not sound
ed until a couple of seconds later. Kid
McCoy thinks that he can defeat Shar
key, and will fight again in the event
that Jeffries is matched to meet Fitz
simmons. He does not want any more
padded floors, as in his last fight, be
cause it interferes with his footwork â
one of his strong points.
The heavyweight thinks Jeffries is in
line for the championship, but is sure
Sharkey's bad judgment will - prevent
him ever becoming the champion.
McCoy looks the picture of health
and has gained twelve pounds since
the fight. While here on a pleasure
trip, primarily, he expects to do - lots
of fighting on the coast, and is making
arrangements also for matches over
his return route to New York a couple
of months hence. '* â¢' .
RELIEF FOR OVERWORKED
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES
CALL HEADQUARTERS, ' SACRA
MENTO, Feb. B.â There is hope for the
calendar of the Supreme Court and the
litigants who are Interested in it if the
bill introduced by Senator Davis in the
Senate to-day prevails. It is a measure
for the practical reorganization of the
appellate courts of the State by providing
district courts of appeals, whose judgment
shall be final in all cases except those in
volving questions of jurisdiction and con
flicts of decision, and in those cases which
are sent directly to the higher court for
consideration. As outlined In the bill, an
appellate court for each of the districts
of the State is provided, the court to con
sist of three Judges to be elected in the
same manner as those of the present Su
preme Court. They will try all appeals
from the Superior courts and their deci
sions will have all the force of those now
delivered by the present higher tribunals.
The bill contains the best features of
three other bills which have been drawn
up for submission and is the result of a
conference between ex-Judge Van R. Pat
erson and Senator Davis, at which they
went over the bills already drawn up and
from them formed the bill Senator Davis
presented to the Senate to-day.

Joint session to-night to consider Assem
bly bills 412 and 413, which were intro

State is asked to simply accept the site
as a clean gift and establish it as the

FREEHOLDER ELECTION
BILL REPORTED BACK
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. B.â Bill 559, relating to mu
nicipal elections for freeholders, and
votes upon existing charters, which Indi
rectly refers to the San Francisco char
ter, and about which there was consid
erable discussion to-day upon the floor
of the Assembly, was taken up by the
Assembly 'Committee on Elections tnis
afternoon and was reported back to the
House with a favorable recommendation.
The. section of the bill . regarding regis
tration was the theme for discussion at
the committee meeting, as was also the
case when it came before the Assembly
earlier in the afternoon. W. J. Biggy,
Registrar of San Francisco, who is the
prime mover in the proposition, appeared
in favor of the bill, which was found to
be defective and which he is in Sacra
mento at present endeavoring to rectify.
The amendments he desired to make
were that not more than six precincts
may consolidate and vote at one polling
place, and also that registration must
commence thirty days before the close
thereof, which is fifteen days before elec
tion. Both amendments were reported
favorably by the committee. * â â *Â
Mr. Biggy explained that he had been
grossly misstated by Assemblyman John
son when the matter came up In the
early part of the afternoon, and wanted
to have Johnson brought before the com
mittee to explain matters. Johnson, how
ever, did not attend the meeting, much to
the disappointment of Mr. Biggy. John
son was seen later and wished to have it
stated that he thought the measure could
not be adopted unless an amendment such
as that of Mr. Biggy was inserted.
Regulating the Schools.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. Two bills, one regulat
ing the government of the State 'ormal
School and the other the public schools,
or more particularly the high schools,
have been Introduced in the Senate by
Senator Boyce.
In the bill treating of the Normal schools
it is provided that the government of the
schools shall be centered in a commission
formed by the Governor and the State
Superintendent of Schools, and five more
apointed by the Governor with the con
currence of the Senate. It is also pro
vided that the presidents of the various
normal schools shall sit with this com
mission and have a voice in its -elibera
tions, but shall have no vote.
This commission shall, acording to the
bill, have the entire government of the
schools, even to the fixing of salaries and
the handling of moneys, and. further, af
ter a diploma has been granted. It has
the power at any time of revoking tho
same for drunkenness, immorality or dis
honesty on the part of the holder. It is
declared in the bill that a diploma from
the normal school shall entitle the holder
to a grammar grade certificate, whicu,
upon a certificate showing that the hold
er has taken the full- course in pedagogy
in the State University, will be raised to
a high school certificate.
The second bill Is to. provide a suitable
and general government for the High
School, element of the public school sys
tem. It proposes to make the superinten
dent of public Instruction, the professor of
pedagogy of the State University, and
three High School principals, selected by
the two first named, a High School Com
mission which shall have charge of such
schools as the statutes designate as
"high."
This- committee will serve without pay
and for terms of three years. . An import
ant portion of its duties will be the ex
amination of other than Normal gradu
ates for High School certificates. The
provisions of the bill are submitted as
amendments to the code.

more, it was not .shown that Smith had

THE LUMBER TRADE.
Referring to the lumber trade In the South
the New York Commercial says: The most re
markable advance In prices has been due to
the war. Lumber, upon which there Is a good
profit at $12 a thousand feet delivered at any of
the Southern ir Southeastern ports, readily
sells for $.0 in the West Indies. Large an
mills have been established everywhere. . The
price of timber lands is from 100 to 1000 per
cent higher than a year ago. The system em
ployed by the lumber concerns la to purchase
the timber alone, thus leaving the land prac
tically cleared, and pine that had formerly
been burned as so much rubbish in order to
clear land is proving a Klondike to land hold
ers. Some idea of the magnitude of the trade
can 1" had from the contract recently let to
a Florida concern by the Government to de
liver 18,000,000 feet of wed timber in Havana.
DRIED FRUITS ASD RAISINS.
The New York Commercial says: Apricots
are very scarce. Probably not over half a
dozen cars left in first hands In this market.

nothing is procurable below 23c. Last year
the same goods sold at less than is asked for
unpeele now.
Raisins are firmer. Sales of several cars of
different grades at nearly full figures within
_ few days indicate the tendency of the mar
ket. Malaga clusters are quoted in a small
way up to .*>3 30, though large sales would be
made down to $1 75. California London lay

large sales are reported, but there is a steady
call for .-mall lots to fill broken assortments.
â¢While no one day's business is large the ag
gregate for a week is quite satisfactory. Ac
cording to mail advices from the coast prices
are relatively higher there than they are here.
'The asking figures there range from 2 a 4'a3'4e,
basis price, for the four sizes. 60-100' In car
lots, however, only small sales are made at
fc'Â«c basis. The four sizes are neglected. Some
dealers are urging sales by offering 50- Ib boxes
at basis price for bags, which is virtually a
cut of '4c.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET. !
I
NEW YORK, Feb. S.â Stock prices closed j
strong with most stocks ruling above yester
day's close, although for the greater part of ;
the forenoon session, extreme weakness pre- '
vailed in practically the entire list, partly the
result of the Impetus of yesterday's decline, i
London bought and sold alternately and on
balance sold about 20,000 shares, the carrying
rates there Indicating a fair supply, of stock.
Practically all the local commission houses had
realizing orders at the opening, a large part
of which sales were apparently due to ex
hausted margins. Many stop-loss orders were
caught on the decline and a general level was
reached of a point and over in trie railways â 
and In some of, the specialties from 2 to 4
points below yesterday.
Monetary conditions remain easier and there J
was no Important news except Aguinaldo's re- 1
quest for a suspension of hostilities to which
is attributed some improvement In American
stocks In the London market. It was said
that one prominent trader had sold 30.000 1
â¢pharos of a leading stock which It was under- I
stood were absorbed by brokers who usually
represented very substantial Interests Several
large bull bouses were buyers on the decline
of stocks with which they are frequently iden- j
tified.
These purchases, being noticed, caused some
covering by the traders, and by noon the i
market started to rally and the .movement,
gained considerable headway as the day pro
gressed, and there were recoveries in practically
every stock that suffered a decline.
The bond market received a fair measure of
attention from the bears in the early trading,
but subsequently developed an improved tone.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Feb. B.â A loss of nearly a cent
a bushel at Liverpool to begin with caused a I
â¢ momentary weakness In wheat here at the com- I
mencement. May opened "4c . lower at 71%'g:
714, but as the depression on the other side I
was acknowledged to have been caused by I
the decline here yesterday prices soon took |
an up turn. The severe cold caused further
1 apprehension with regard to winter wheat arfd
sera weather was. reported prevailing almost
j as far south as Texas. Advices from Michigan
agricultural societies expressed the opinion that
the plant in that State suffered considerably
! during the last month. Light Northwestern re
ceipts also aided the bulls, and May was_grad
! fly bid ' tip to" 72. .." Exporters here stated ]
j that foreign bids were 3, cents out of line, but
New York reported thirty boat loads sold for
export, Trade was chiefly of a professional
i character, active in spots and dull over large
spaces of time. As the session advanced the
| shorts became uneasy and sold moderately . to I
! cover previous, sales, and .' May. which had
sagged back to 72. started rising again. Near j
, the end more ' positive ' bullishness was shown
i with heavy buying of July by St. Louis parties
the feature. The local crowd stuck to the May
I delivery and forced it up to 72% c, the price at J
thi .lose being 72*4 buyers. .: . , â  '
Extreme cold dry weather started corn easy, j
, Elevator people reported practically nothing I
was being offered from the country, however,
and the market became decidedly strong with j
j the buying quite general. * May closed 4Â®*_c
1 higher.
There was a fair trade in oats, with a large
! number of orders on the market, closing %@%c
. advance.
A good cash demand for meats and light re
ceipts of hogs strengthened provisions. Trade
was light, however, and business was chletly
jof a scalping nature. Pork rase 74.- and lard
and ribs, left off a shade higher.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Feb. The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: Con
sumers of wool feel somewhat encouraged on
account of the firmer position of the goods
market and are disposed to look around for
stock. Some of the large mills have been re
ported in the market and considerable figur
ing has been done on good sized lines which
has not at this writing, however, resulted in
any increase In business. â¢ The actual sales so j
far as ascertained in fact are slightly less than
those of last week, but there is unquestionably
more desire on the part of manufacturers to
buy. although In several instances their Ideas
of what they shall pay are below the views
of the holders of wool. The latter, however.
are pretty firm and we hear of no instance
where any concessions have been made. The
demand Is chiefly for wools which enter into
serges and cheviot goods. # The sales of the
week In the Boston market 'amount to 3,640.000 \
pounds domestic and 620.000 pounds foreign,
making a total of 4.260,000 pounds, against a
total of 4,686,000 for the previous week, and a
total of 3,113.000 pounds, for the corresponding
week last year. Sales since January 1, 1899.
amount to 22.142.000 pounds, against -6,725.000
pounds last year at this time.

"The market as a rule has been very quiet
since the issue of our circular of January 7
and prices for all except common qualities are
decidedly easier. Arrivals have been moderate
for this season of the year, and pending freer
movement of the crop dealers are buying in the
. most conservative way, believing that .values
have not yet settled to a . level that would ;
justify them in carrying heavier stocks. With ;
' the exception of coffees grading 8c and under, i
i which seem for the present at least to have j
reached a stable basis of prices, our quotations {
are largely nominal, the sales of better classes
of coffee going at* such Irregular figures as to !
prevent more accurate description. Strictly fine
washed Guatemalan still find buyers at about
former ratesâ in fact the supply of these Is not
equal to the demand.
"The New York market showed a slight im- 1
provement in futures toward the end of Janu
ary, which has since h^en practically lost.
j Brazil coffee on the spot has scarcely fluc
j tuated during the past month, with very dull
business.

FARE â *. 50,ONE MYSTERY
OF THE DEEP
CLEARED UP
Nomad Capsized and
All Perished.
CAPTAIN'S DAUGHTER LOST
MADE A TRIP WITH HER
' FATHER FOR HER HEALTH.
December, '97, the Vessel Left China
for This Coast and Drifted
Ashore Bottom Side Up on
Hawaii Last Month.
*
â  The fate of the missing schooner No
mad has at last been solved, and another
mystery of the sea cleared up. All that
was left of the vessel washed ashore on
the island of Hawaii last month and con
â  viction will now be borne in on a widowed ;
and childless woman, who has persisted in
â¢ hoping against hope for nearly a year.
Mrs. McAUap of this city had her hus
band, two sons and daughter aboard the
*. schooner and all of them perished in the
wreck.
The Nomad was built by Hall Bros, of
. San Francisco at Port Blakcley, and was
â launched in August. 1537. She was rigged
as a four-masted schooner and her ton
... nage was 485 net. She was 168 feet 4
Inches long. 37 feet 6 Inches beam and 12 â 
â¢ .feet 8 inches deep, and as handsome a j
. craft as ever sailed out of Puget Sound.
.'.She was loaded with lumber and early i
... in September sailed for China in cum-.
'â â¢' maud of Captain John W. McAllep. The
,' captain's daughter. Miss Helen McAllep, i
'.had been ailing for some time and it was i
- ..decided that she should make the trip
â¢with her father. Mrs. McAllep disliked to
.part with her daughter, but the welfare
Of the child outweighed the mother love.
With Captain McAllep also went his two
â sons, Weston C. McAllep, who shipped as
'carpenter, and George H. McAUep, sea- |
man. The entire family, with the excep
. tion of the mother, was therefore aboard
â¢ the Nomad when she capsized.
The other members of the schooner \
â crew were: C. W. Soderstrum, mate;
â Charles Looman, second mate; Fred
Holmes, cook; R. Visentlni. K. Thompson
and G. Olsen, seamen, and L,. E. Blood- ;
. good, cabin boy.
â  The Nomad made a quick run across the
Pacific and from Shanghai Captain Mc- â 
Allep wrote, saying he was going to bring
l ha vessel home in ballast. On December '
7, 1557. the schooner sailed and a year ago,
this month, when nothing had been heard
. from her. The Call exclusively pointed
'. cut the fact that she was overdue and at
the same time published a cut of the yes- â 
â se.l. This picture was worked up by Mr.
â Coulter from the plans in Hall Bros.'
office, and is the only one of the Nomad in
â  existence: .--â '-"-
In June. ISPS, when the schooner was j
given up for lost, the hull, bottom up, was
' supposed to have been seen off Coos Bay..
Ob June 23, In latitude 43.1." north, long'-* ,
* tude 129.50 west. Captain Christenson of
the schooner Eliza. Miller sighted a large
vessel bottom up. From the description :
. he furnished Hall Bros., the builders were j
. satisfied the wreck was that of the No
mad, but nothing was known for certain
'until the hull went ashore on the Island j
of Hawaii.
* ** Ship captains think that when making â¢
â¢his .run to the Sound from Shanghai Cap
tain McAllep follow- d . the .great .circle.
This would bring him off the coast of ; '
Alaska, when the storms, of January and 1
February were doing so much damage to I
'shipping. The schooner being lightly bal- i
. lasted turned turtle in a squall and all !
â¢ hands per:
. There is In use in the harbor of Hone-
I lulu at the present time a buoy which:
went adrift at Coos Bay, was carried
'.-south by the current and went ashore on '
.the- Island of Hawaii very close to where
the wreck of the Nomad now lies.
'.The inter-lsland steamer Mauna Loa
' brought the news of the wreck to Hono- '
-'lulu a few hours before the sailing of the i
Moana. A body washed ashore from the j
'wreck of the schooner. It is supposed
'.to have been one of the crew who was
â  pinned in his berth when the schooner
â capsized, and was held there until the
shock of the hull striking the rocks re
leased the body. The head and feet j
.were exposed and had been eaten off by!
sharks, bo there was nothing by which !
to- identify the remains. And thus is an- j
other mystery of the ocean in a measure !
solved. â¢
NEW MOANA PURSER.
*. Mariposa Beats the Nippon Maru in
the Run to Honolulu.
':â¢â¢;. The mail steamer Moana arrived from
'Sydney, N. S. W., via Auckland, X. Z.,
â¢ Apia. Samoa, and Honolulu. H. 1., yester
day: Among her cargo was $2,250,000 ln
English sovereigns, the balance of trade
In* favor of the United States. Purser B.
B. .Bendel did not come back on the mail
â¢ boat, but his place was ably filled by J. H.
.-G'.Bond. Mr. Bendel has secured a good
': position with the T. & S. Morrin Com
:. pany of Auckland, X. Z. , and is going to
' iharry and settle down. He was one of
the most popular pursers that came into
the port, but his loss is compensated for
,'by the advent of Mr. Bond. He was for
merly on the steamer Taimui. running to
'.Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Tahiti, and was
/a general favorite. He has made many
: . friends on the Moana. and It Is to be
; hoped the company will keep him with
the' mail boat.
The Moana brings the news that the
steamer Mariposa beat the Nippon Maru
. three hours to Honolulu. The Nippon
'.Maru left here at 8:55 p. m. on January
25 and the Mariposa at 1:05 a. m. on Jan
uary 2**. The Nippon Maru arrived off
* Honolulu at 12:15 a. m. on February 1,

CAPSIZED IN A HURRICANE.
THE mystery surrounding the loss of the American schooner Nomad has in a measure been solved
She left Shanghai in ballast for Puget Sound in December, 1897, and was â  never heard from
again until the hull went ashore bottom up on the Island of Hawaii last month. Captain Mc-
Allep. his two sons and his only daughter perished when the schooner capsized off the Alaskan coast
In June, 1898, the hull of the Nomad was seen off Coos Bay by the captain of the Eliza Miller
the bay to-morrow, and the next day she
will make her six hours consecutive run.
This will be no speed test, but in order
to fulfill the contract the Chitose must
run for six hours continuously with the
engines making so many revolutions a
minute. Captain C. Miner Goodall will be
in command of the cruiser.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus

HOW KENNEDY
MADE LOVE TO
MRS. REGAN
â¢
Alleged Slayer Tells
Her Story.
' _ .
SLAPPED AND KICKED HER
SEVERAL TIMES HE THREAT
ENED TO SHOOT HER.
The Woman Takes the Witness
Stand in Her Own Behalf and
Pictures Herself a
Martyr.
Mrs. Elizabeth Regan began the narra
tion of her relations with Policeman
Thomas H. Kennedy, whom she ia accused
of having murdered,' In .Judge "Graham's
court .'yesterday afternoon, but had* not
concluded her. statement when the court
adjourned ' till this morning.. There were
a- large* number r of ladles in the court
room. Mrs. Regan was entirely self
possessed and talked so glibly that the
court stenographer had hard work to keep *
up with her. '.-;- ;>,;â¢;. -Â-.-.-â¢
* Previous to Mrs. Regan taking the
stand Mrs. Arethusa Teal, 1640 Polk
street, testified that she had been a neigh
bor of Mrs. Regan in 1896 and 1897. when
Mrs. Regan kept the saloon at 1725, Mis
sion street. She saw Kennedy there al
most every day and night and had heard
Kennedy often say that he was to marry
Mrs. Regan and go to Nevada.' She ad- j
vised Mrs. Regan not to marry Kennedy !
for certain reasons, and Mrs. Regan said â 
she would have to marry him to get rid
of him. She knew that Kennedy used to
abuse Mrs. Regan, and * that was one of
the reasons why she advised her not to
marry him. Kennedy appeared to be very
devoted to 'Mrs. Regan.
At the conclusion of Mrs. Teal's testi
mony, Attorney Long asked for ten min
utes to. consult with his client, and it was
granted. At the expiration of the ten j
minutes they, returned to court and Mrs. j
Regan took the stand. She was told by
her attorney to tell ln her own way about |
her first meeting with Kennedy and their
relations since. She said she had known !
him for five years and flrst met him at ;
Mlchelson's stables on Ellis street. Since
then they had kept steady company. She |
saw him every night till she left the sa- j
loon, 1725 Mission street, on December 2, j
1897. He may have been angry and stayed '
away for a night or so. He would call In â 
when passing to have a "ball" as he ;
called it. and when he reported off duty. \
Sometimes he would abuse her for not
watching for him ln the mornings and j
j accuse her of being with another "bloke^. i
I and not being true to him. The language i
i he would use .to her on these occasions j
'. she -whispered to ** the - Judge, Attorney I
j Barrett and Attorney Long* as she said j
it was unfit to be told In open court. If j
1 he did not come to her house she would;
f' o to his apartments in . the Palmer j
louse. . -â¢'.'- I
i At different times Kennedy had slapped ,
; her face, pulled her hair , out, and in
April, 1597, he blackened one of her eyes. |
i He was annoyed because she did not close
, up the saloon, as some men were there. :
; He took her to his room and used leeches ;
ion the swollen eye. and she remained I
â  there two days till the discoloration had
: nearly gone. November 19, 1897, they had :
' some words about an Insane family, and ,
j Kennedy threatened her. and said she was
! not worth enough powder to blow her to
Hades. After that she refused to sec him
j for three days, although he called dally, i
; and finally when she did see him
he grabbed hold of her and shook her. He *
was trembling all over and crying. He ,
pulled out a revolver and said: "Liz, if it
J were not for your kid's sake I would fill
j you full of lead." He accused her of go
â¢ Ing with another man, and said he would
i kill her. He had been drinking. She went :
: for a walk with him and they met Police- .
: man Thompson. Kennedy began to cry t
i again, and she told Thompson he had ;
threatened her. She managed to quietly â 
: take the revolver out of his pocket, and ]
! all danger was passed. Next day they
made up and he promised to marry her. '
In April or May of last year, after they I
i had been to the theater and had supper ;
| at a restaurant in the Mission, he wanted |
i her to go to his apartments, but she re- !
I fused, and told him there was^another j
who had taken his place. He got mad. ;
tried to choke her, threw her
down and kicked her. He pulled \
I his revolver *. out of his pocket I
! and threatened to kill her. He left her ;
I and she made her way to tlie drugstore at j
Sixteenth and Valencia streets, where she
I was treated. They made up again and he j
i came to her house right along. â¢
In November she gave him up. He was â 
' In a private hospital on Van Ness aye
! nue at the time and she called there and *
' gave him $20, telling him it was all over
i between them. After Kennedy left the
â  hospital he went to live at 1007 Larkin i
street, and on December 2 of that year
he sent .her the . following letter by a
. messenger; .x7-'Xx[
' " - city. Dee. 2, 1996.
My Good Kind Friend: I should have said
sweetheart, but I am afraid of your wrath.
I want to see you so bad. I am Just beside i
myself. I wrote you the day I left the hos- ;
pital and received nit. I will' be confined to |
bed for fifteen days yet, so I could not take â 
advantage of your Invitation to come and see j
you. Good josh. Now. if you only knew, and j
you must know, that I want to see you so I
bad I am Just nutty. Just to apologise s and \
ask forgiveness, find then I think . I can get I
one peaceful sleep. Don't be hard-hearted.
j Give me a chance to be the man. I am to be. j
! You know I am as true as steel. Come and
sec me or just write one kind word.' Your only
true friend. TOM.
p. s.â You can frame this If you wish and
hang It up on the bar.
â  .. OLD HARD LUCK.
She told the messenger there was no i
answer, and an hour or so later he re- {
turned with another long letter from j
; Kennedy, In which he pleaded for forgive
ness, asking her not to. treat him like a
dog. as she was the only. lady in the land
that he adored, and she knew he loved
j her so dearly. He signed the letter "Tom.
I Unlucky and Miserable."
At this stage the Judge said he had
enough for one day. and adjourned court â 
I till this morning, when the defendant will j
j resume her narrative. ;
THE BATTLE OF THE DRUMS.
Police . on Parade, Headed by Two
Members of the Famous ' Corps.
There was a full dress parade of the
men in Captain Wlttman's division on
Van Ness avenue yesterday morning, and
as each man carried I a rifle and the bat
talion was headed by two members of the
famous drum corps, out for the flrst't'me,,
the effect was imposing and exhilarating.
Chief --Lees was not present, but ". Cap
tain Wlttman was there In full dress uni
form, and put the men through their evo
lutions. -The two drummers,. Johnnie Mc-
Laughlin and â * Loyal Webster, x Whacked
the drums so artistically as to give, the
Impression that they were old hands at
Cost of Nicaragua Canal.
The estimates as to the cost of constructing
the . Nicaragua j canal vary : from $115,000,000 to
*]._., 000. , How ; different" are the estimates"
of * the people" as to : the value of Hosteller's*
Stomach ; Bitters for stomach, ; liver, blood %nd
kidney diseases- It is â  agreed everywhere that
this remedy is unsurpassed for *â¢ indigestion,
biliousness,: *.- constipation,* v nervousness *â  and
sleeplessness., It is such an agreeable medicine
to take. It tastes good as well as does good.
the business. The other members of the
corps are not - sufficiently * trained to ap
pear on parade, but diligent practice will
soon make them perfect. As the battalion
returned to the City Hall with the drums
beating it created quite a sensation. j;;';
CAUGHT, ESCAPED
AND RECAPTURED
3IMON GALLICK, A NOTABLE
CROOK, BEHIND THE BARS.
â 
A Plucky Landlady Gives the Alarm
and a Special and an Officer Do
the Restâ Police Jubilant.
Simon Gallick, a notorious young crook,
is congratulating himself that he is not
occupying space in the Morgue instead of
a cell in the -City Prison with a charge
of burglary against him. He owes his life
to the poor marksmanship of Officer P.
H. Murphy and his incarceration to the
uncharitableness of a citizen whose cellar
he invaded in search of a hiding place.
Gallick has a penchant for the belong
ings of others, and this failing led him to
inspect' the rooms of the Hotel Marechal
Kiel" with dire results.
While ransacking room 38 on the third
floor of that caravansary he was discov
ered by its proprietress, Mme. Cazeaux,
and whyi asked by her to explain his
presence he gave a weak excuse. Believ
ing him to be a thief she tried to lock
him In until assistance could be had, but
before she could carry out her purpose
Gallick dashed by her and rushed down
the stairs. The screams of Mme. Cazeaux
and the clatter of the escaping burglar
attracted the attention of Bellboy Harry
Timmerman, who gave chase.
Gallick sped, down Leavenworth street,
with .Timmerman at his heels, and the
former tried to shake his pursuer by.
dodging into a coalyard. An unknown
special officer followed him into the coal
yard and took him Into custody. He was
taken back to the hotel and- Identified,
and jon his way to the City Prison gave
his captor the slip. Again he sought lib
erty, and he rushed up Turk street,-fol
lowed by the unfortunate officer. Th. hue
and cry attracted Officer P. H. Murphy '
who was in the vicinity, and he joined in
the chase. Unmindful of the latter's
cries to halt Gallick continued his flight,
and Murphy tried to check his speed with
a bullet, without success. The escaping
prisoner turned down Polk street to Wil
low avenue, and hid In the basement of
No, 37. While there Officer O. C. Phillips
was Informed and he entered and recap
tured him.
When searched at the prison a pawn
ticket made out to "Smith," his alias, was
found on his person. Two valuable
trinkets had been pawned by him for 75
cents.
Gallick is well known to the police', and
his capture is looked upon as a fortunate
one. He has been arrested time and ay-iln,
but has always escaped conviction. De
tective Sullivan and Officer Phillips have
been detailed on the case and are collect
ing some strong evidence against nim.
Mme. Cazeaux Informed hte police that
during the past three months her hotel
has been entered frequently and many
articles taken. The police believe that ln
Gallick they have the unwelcome visitor.

COMMITTEE
MAY NOT FIX
WATER RATES
"Solid Six "Decline to
Appear.
BOTH PLANTS NECESSARY
' NO NEED TO DO POLITICS AT
THIS TIM*.
Combination Preparing to Show That j
It Is Entitled to Rates in Ac
cordance With Its Own
Figures.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
. 90S Broadway, Feb. 8.
â¢ The fixing of water rates is invested
.- with renewed interest now that it is
known that there is but one water com
: bination in this city. Last year the Fire
.' and Water Committee tried to fix the
rates in such a manner as would pay a
.reasonable interest on one complete plant.
This year, according to the decision of the
.Supreme Court, the rates must be fixed
â¢..'on the combined valuations of both
: plants. Some of the officials of the two
â¢: water companies declared to-day that
ithey know nothing of the consolidation,
: but make no attempt to deny it. One of
them .said that even if consolidation
. should have been effected between the
; companies he might not know it for some
days.
.Everything, however, even to the de
" tails, has been arranged and closed, and
only awaits the formal ratification of the
I stockholders of the Contra Costa Com
ipaiiy. As the stockholders many months
ago passed a resolution authorizing the
'.directors to make just such a deal as has
.been closed, there is no opposition possl
* bl.e to the consolidation, which will be
.ratified at the annual meeting in April.
.-â¢ Last night there was to have been a
meeting of the committee to begin the
'..fixing of water rates for the next fiscal
â¢year. Of the rive members only two were
present, and it Is rumored that a major
ity of the committee, who are also the
â¢ '/solid six," wil make no effort to fix the
â -..rates this year, on the ground that it is
.the duty of the Council to do this and not
â¢the duty of the committee. Furthermore,
: the committee will make the argument
that its labors are useless, inasmuch as its
.'â¢recommendation and schedule passed last
..year by it and submitted to the Council
were ignored and rates altogether dif
ferent passed. The present committee
â¢ was appointed after the rates were fixed
. last year and its personnel differs ma
terially from the old committee. It is
now composed of Councilman Upton and
four of the members of the "solid six."
'. I-t is generally believed that the water
companies are not taking any hand in
â¢politics this year, for had they been inter
ested in the election of a City Council
â¢ or* Board of Works they would not have
â¢ raised rates as they have done at the be
. ginning of the campaign, thereby forcing
..the issue upon all candidates.
.â  At the present time nature has come to
â .the assistance of the companies by in
flicting two dry years upon the State.
The water people are now preparing to
prove before the City Council that both
th*" Dingee and Contra Costa plants are
absolutely necessary to supply Oakland
with water, and the condition of the lake
is somewhat in their favor.
TWELVE MEN CHOSEN
TO TRY BRANDE3
TAKING OF TESTIMONY IS TO
BEGIN TO-DAY.
'The Grewsome Skull of the Murdered
' Girl Will Be the Object of the
Defense's Main Hope.
*'-; Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
*;.":' 90S Broadway, Feb. 8.
*"' The taking of testimony In the trial of
'William A. Brandes, who stands ac
' cu'sed of having beaten to death his thir
teen-year-old daughter, will begin to
morrow in Judge Hall's court, and the
fate of the accused murderer will rest In
the hands of the following twelve men,
the Impaneling of the jury being com
pleted shortly after 5 o'clock this after
noon:
G. W. Gordan, W. T. Gibbs, Charles
Bock, B. S. Marston, A. Jonas, H. W.
Brunson, Phil Sleben, E. A. Randlett,
George H. Furry, A. L. Brown, H. E.
Long and Spencer B. Irish.
When proceedings were resumed this
morning Attorney W. F. Sawyer on be
half of the defense again attempted to
have all the jurors discharged, challeng
ing them on the ground that they had
been Irregularly drawn. Sawyer argued
that there were 250 persons drawn- as
trial jurors for the year and that none
of these had been used to try his client.
He contended that this was a violation of
the rights of the prisoner.
Judge Hall, however, disallowed Attor
ney Sawyer's challenges, and exceptions
were taken.
In the examination of the trial jurors,
which was then resumed, It was remark
able to find how many possessed scruples
against capital punishment, and also
against convictions based on circumstan
tial evidence.
During the proceedings Brandes had sit
ting by his side his nine-year-old son and
another little daughter, who in their in
nocent way would occasionally ask when
questions touching a juror's feeling in the
case were propounded whether that was
good or not for their father.
Among the physicians and surgeons
who are to give expert testimony are Drs.
Woolsey. But* au. Pratt and others, and' a
strong effort will be made to establish by
the exhibition of the skull of the dead
girl that there is nothing to show that
blows upon the head caused death.
ALAMEDA OFFICIALS
SHARE CITY CONTRACTS
Charged by Business Rivals With
' . Insuring Public Buildings in
Companies for Which They
Are the Agents.
ALAMEDA. Feb. Local insurance
agents who were overlooked when the In
- surance on the City Hall and other public
property was parceled out are very much
â¢dissatisfied and threaten to stir up trouble
over the matter. Several city officials are
engaged in the fire insurance business on
the side, and a considerable share of the
risks on the City Hall and public schools i
has been handled by them. * The agents !
who have been left out in the cold claim
that the fortunate ones, being city offi
cials, have no right to, be Interested in a
contract with the city, and that by so
doing they lay themselves liable to re
moval from office and subsequent. prose
cution.
The agents base their contention on sec
tion 811, article 5 of the laws governing
cities of the flfth class, which reads::
''No officer of such city shall . be inter
ested, directly or indirectly, in any con
â¢ tract with such city, or with any of the
officers thereof, in their official capacity,
or in doing any work; or furnishing any
supplies for the use of such city or -its
officers In their official capacity; and any
claim for compensation for. work done, or
supplies or materials furnished, in which
any such officer, is Interested, shall -be
void, and if audited and allowed shall not
be paid by the Treasurer. Any willful vlo
lation of the provisions of this section
shall be a ground for removal from offlce,
and shall be deemed a misdemeanor, and
punished as such."
The officers at whom the charges are
leveled are J. B. Lanktree. member of the
Board of Education, and E. Minor Smith,
City Assessor. Both gentlemen are in the
Insurance business. The City Trustees
allowed their claims for insurance pre
miums on the City Hall and electric light
works Monday night. The warrants for
these claims will be ready to-morrow
morning. Whether any action will be
taken to prevent their payment or
whether the disgruntled agents will take
any further steps in the matter they de
cline to state. >*v

MIRACULOUS ESCAPE
BENEATH AN ENGINE
OAKLAND, Feb. 8.-Eddle Raftery, a
newsboy, aged 11 years, and residing
with his mother at 520 East Four
teenth street, was struck by a loco
motive at the Oakland Mole this after
noon and miraculously escaped with only
B few bruises about the face; yet he was
picked up from beneath the tender with I
his legs lying across the rails and pro
truding from between two of the tender's
wheels.
Raftery and another newsboy, J. Roach,
who recently picked up a wallet contain
ing some $26,000 on a train returning from
the racetrack, were running across the
tracks at the time of the accident, and the
injured boy was struck by Engineer Con
Collins* locomotive. No. 1405, which had
just been uncoupled from the Stockton I
train that had arrived at the Mole at 3:45 !
o'clock. Raftery was hurled under the
tender, but Engineer Collins in the twink
ling of an eye reversed his engine and
I stopped within the length of his tender.
The lad's body had evidently struck
against the axle of the truck and was
thus saved from being mangled or crushed
by the ashbox of the engine.
The boy was picked up by P. H. Malo
ney, one of the train men, and Agent
Brady of "Wells-Fargo. and taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where Warden Keat- !
Ing and Dr. Hahn dressed his lacerated i
face. No bones were found to be broken, !
but the little fellow suffered from much
soreness In the regions where he had been
first struck.
Frequently, while the physicians were
dressing his injuries and bandaging his
bead, the little fellow, with tears in his
eyes, asked imploringly, 'Do you think,
doctor, that I will die with such a face on |
me?" This thought seemed uppermost in |
his mind, and he feared that he would j
frighten his mother.
MARRIAGE BUREAU
FAKERS CONVICTED
GUILT OF ISAAC BAIN AND IDA
QUINN DETERMINED.
Mr. Crowley's . Quotations From
Skakespeare Offset by Attorney
Foote's Excerpt From the
Sermon on the Mount,
Isaac W. Bain, alias H. C. Curtis, and
Mrs. Ida Quinn, alias Mrs. Grace Allison,
alias Mrs. Ida Collins, alias Miss Smith,
were convicted by a jury yesterday in the
United States District Court, and the un
scrupulous brace of sharpers were com
mitted to the . custody of the United
States Marshal. They will be brought
Into court to-morrow for sentence.
The offense of which they were con
victed was using the mails for the pur
pose of defrauding unsophisticated ya
hoos from California and Texas, and they
may be punished by imprisonment for
eighteen months.
T. J. Crowley for the defense closed his
argument to the jury yesterday. He is a
ripe Shakespearean scholar, being a mem
ber of the Old Friends Society, whose
club rooms at 110 Ellis street adjoin the
Bain-Allison, etc., marriage bureau In the
same building. The learned counsel
quoted freely from Shakespeare to prove
the putative Innocence of his clients, but
the force of his eloquence was neutralized
by United States Attorney Foote, who
quoted not only from Shakespeare, but
also from the Sermon on the Mount, ,
which Mr, Crowley had inadvertently
overlooked. Mr. Foote. barring the quo
tations mentioned, made a plain business
talk to the jury and held up the Bain and
Allison gang in their true colors.
The jury were out only five minues.
Bain has a prior conviction against him
for a similar offense and he will be given
the full punishment imposed by the
statute. ? : -i *â *,'â¢* '
ROBBED HER HOUSE
DURING HER ABSENCE
MRS. RICHIE MOURNS THE LOSS
OF VALUABLE JEWELRY.
Returned Home From the Theater to
Find That Thieves Had Helped
Themselves to Her Gems.
'
The home of Mrs. Richie, 909 Oak street,
was robbed last Saturday night by two
unknown men. The entire house was ran
sacked, and , over $300 worth of jewelry
taken. It is supposed the thieves effected
an entrance through one of the side win
dows during i the attendance of Mrs.
Richie and her daughter at the theater.
Furniture was overturned, and the con
tents of looted drawers strewn in confu
sion on the floor. Nothing was taken,
however, except jewelry. ..
The attention of the woman occupying
the apartments above was attracted by
the noise made by the thieves In over
turning the furniture. She knew that rob
bers must be in the house, as Mrs. Richie
had told her that it would be late before
she and her daughter returned.- She Im
mediately gave an alarm by opening one
of the windows facing the street and call
ing for help. She had hardly made the
first outcry when the thieves escaped
from the building through the window.
The woman describes them as being of
ordinary build. She claims they both wore
overcoats, one of light and the other of
dark material. <-*
The robbery was reported at police
headquarters and the authorities assert
that the Identity of the two men is known
and that it will be a matter of only a day

REPORTS 40 DIRECTORS
MB. SHORTRIDGE SPOKE TO THE
BLACKSMITH.
Dibble and Way-mire's Opposition to
the Garnishee Bill Results
in a Search of
Records.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 8.
President George W. Arper of the Mer
chants' Exchange has returned from nis
mission to Sacarumento and has presented
a report to the exchange. Mr. Arper
went to the capital in the interest of sev
eral bills, one of them providing for the
garnisheeing of the \ salaries of civil â  offi
cials to satisfy judgments. , Two years
ago the bill was killed by Assemblyman
Waymire of Alameda.'
In his report regarding the bill Presi
dent Arper said:
"We first visited the Judiciary Commit
tee of the Senate. Grove L. Johnsoa was
chairman. We were given an opportunity
to express our opinions upon the bills.
Assemblyman Dibble was one of the com
mittee. He stated to us that the garni
shee bill had been before the Senate
two years ago and Judge Waymire had
decided that it was unconstitutional, and
it was beaten. He said it should be beat
en now. His argument was that the offi
cials should not be trusted, or lf tficv
were the creditors should be beaten.
"Mr. Walker and I replied to his state
ments. I told him that we had selected
himto introduce the bill, thinking he was
an honest and judicious man. 1 told him
I was very much surprised to see him
working against the bill. I then looked
up the record of Judge Waymire and
found 150 unsatisfied judgments against
him. I did not know then that It was al
most impossible to collect a bill from
Dibble, and that no collection agency
would take a bill against him. I fou:.d
this out later. Considering this fact, it
could not be expected that he would work
for a debtor law.
"Mr. Walker presented statistical data
in regard to mutual fire insurance in a
very able manner. His arguments - were
incontrovertible. He was very rudely in
terrupted several times by some of the
august Senators. They would yell out:
'Can you explain how that Is?' 'Can't I
ask you a question?' In a very few min
utes we found that we were up against
the real thing. We made up our minds
not to be beaten by such a game. After
Mr. Walker had finished they called for
expert testimony. Mr. Bretz then took
the floor. He answered all their questions
satisfactorily, and they let him alone.
"Charles Shortridge made himself par
ticularly objectionable. He wished to
know what business we represented.
When he learned that Mr. Sohst was a
blacksmith he asked to hear what the
blacksmith had to say for himself. ; â
"Mr. Sohst soon ; demonstrated to Mr.
Shortridge that he was able to hold hie
own. ....-'â¢
"I expressed myself In favor of the mu
tual fire insurance bill. Shortridge asked |
me If I knew why I was in favor of It. I j
replied that I did, and in return asked
him if he knew why he was opposed to
it. He said he was opposed to it because
his friend Bill Sexton told him It was
not good. I then recognized that we were
in a ditch.
"On the vote being taken It stood five
against the bill and three for It. It was â¢,
suggested that the bill be amended so that !
It would read that Insurance would be â 
paid wholly In money and not ' part in j
notes and part in money. Two of the
committee stated that they would then
be in favor of the bill and do all they |
could for, its passage. . _
"The tunnel bill will be passed. I have i
no doubt of It. .It is reasonably assured
that the county division > bill will go â 
through. The .bill for garnisheeing wages I
is in a fair way." :
BRIGHT WOMEN WHO

INTERESTING REPORTS OF CAL

A Wiae Diversity of Action Along
the Lines of Ameliorating Con

Poor.
The rooms of the California Club were ,
filled to overflowing Tuesday afternoon,
the occasion, being the regular meeting of
that large and . prosperous organization,
at which quarterly reports from the va
rious sections were to be read, and dis
cussed.
Mrs. i-ovell White, president of the
club, occupied the chair and presided with
her usual gracious dignity. Reports from
the various officers were first submitted
and were in every case of a most gratify
ing nature, showing as they did that the
club is making steady progress along the
lines marked out for it by the earnest
women who were instrumental in - its
formation a twelvemonth since. Three
new members were admitted, and Miss
Julia George presented a statement con
cerning the book of war poems recently
published by the club, which statement
shows that a handsome profit has been
already realized by the sale of the vol
ume, and that the demand is steadily In
creasing. '

ment having proved that it is not wise to
open these grounds to all comers, a boys'
athletic club has been formed,- the 150
members of which -â  are to be depended
upon not to Injure the paraphernalia or
deface the place in any. way. Mrs. Sha

DENIES CONNECTION
WITH SAMOAN TROUBLE
DR. AUGUSTIN KRAMER AR
RIVES FROM APIA.
Asserts He Is a Surgeon in the Ger
man Navy on His Way Home
After a Leave of Absence.
Dr. Augustin Kramer, about whom cer
tain stories have been published regard
ing his connection with the recent po
litical troubles In Samoa, arrived yester
day on the Moana from Apia and "left on
the evening train for New York on his
way home to Germany. It was strongly
suspected by the other passengers on the
steamer that Dr. Kramer was traveling
incog. aÂ»id was no other than Dr. yon
Rappel, president of the Municipal Coun
cil at Apia. The latter during the Samoan
trouble claimed that the functions of
Chief Justice Chambers ceased upon the
death of King Malletoa, and that he, as
president of the Council, was the supreme
authority until a new King was elected.
He declared that he would close the doors
2._. the Supreme Court and* prevent the
Chief Justice from further exercising his
functions. The American and British
Consuls consulted with the captain of the
British man-of-war in regard to the dec
laration, who Informed Dr. Rappel that
he would break open the doors If they
were not opened the next day at 11 a. m.
Dr. Rappel at this ultimatum thought It
wise to comply with the order, and the
doors were opened.
Dr. Rappel acted in various ways in an
offensive manner and led the Mataafa
men against Malletoa Tanu; son of the
dead King, riding on horseback at their
head. Captain Sturdee, the British com
mander, met him on the street afterward
and, addressing Rappel, said: "You
scoundrel, you are the cause of all this
trouble. I am surprised that Germany
should be represented by so contemptible
a man."
- Dr. Kramer when seen on the Moana
asserted that he was not Rappel, and
Kramer .was his proper name, and that
he was a surgeon in the German navy.
His home ft in Kiel, and he had been on
a; two years' leave of absence in Samoa
making scientific investigations for his
Government. His leave had expired and
he was going back home. He declined to
discuss the subject further, but conde
scended to give his version of the Samoan
trouble.
"I can assure you," he said, "that quiet
reigns In Apia, where the fight between
the followers of Mataafa' and Malletoa
Tanu took place. A provisional govern
ment has been established with Mataafa
at the head, and the representatives of
the three Powers ; that have control In
Samoa are awaiting a joint decision. Ma
taafa is really not the King, but is wait
ing for this decision.
"The trouble, as you know, originated
when the Chief Justice, an American, de
clared Malietoa Tanu King, although
Mataafa had been chosen in the election
by 4000 majority. The Mataafa people de
cided to depose Malletoa and the Vice
King. Tamasese, and after, a council of
war . gathered in the mountains and com
pletely surrounded the town of Apia.
Malletoa had about a thousand men and
Mataafa nearly five thousand. On the
afternoon of January 1, 1899, the natives
swept down from the mountains and at
tacked Malietoa' inadequate force. Mal
letoa, seeing no chance, fled with 800 fol
lowers to the English man-of-war Por
poise. The next day they were sent
a_hore without arms and told to consider
themselves prisoners of Mataafa. This
they did and they were then banished to
the various small' islands. Malletoa and
Tamasese remained on board the Porpoise
and were there when I left.
"As I say, matters are at a standstill
until the decision of the Powers is pro
mulgated."
Passing of a Pioneer.
"H. A. Benson, an old and respected resi
dent of this city, passed away at an early
hour yesterday morning, after a brief ill
ness lasting about a week, at the ripe
age of 80 years.
Mr. Benson was among the number of
those dauntless pioneers who crossed the
plains in the days of "49" and was at one
time a member of the California Pioneer
Society. :
Deceased was born in Skaneateles, On
ondaga County, New York, and when the
gold fever struck the East : he - joined a
party who crossed the plains, arriving In
San: Francisco early In the spring of 1850.
He turned his attention to mining and fol
lowed that for many years .on - Feather
River, in and about Rich Bar and Gold
Hill; tiring of this he removed to Con
tra Costa County and 'â '. settled at San
Pablo In 1854, where he purchased a ranch,
following that vocation until 1874. when
he removed to Oakland, after accumulat
ing a fortune. He has not been active In
business for many years, although he has
been and was up to the time of Tils death
a man -of great physical energy, having
had but little sickness through; life. His
kind and . genial I manner.' endeared - him to
all * who came in contact with him. .*, -. .--
Deceased leaves a widow and â â two chil
dren, C. H. Benson of Marin County and
Mrs. James â¢S. Mitchell of Oakland, to
mourn his loss. He. had at large circle of
friends in both Contra Costa and Alameda
Counties. A brother, Alanson Benson, is
a resident of Oakland. * : >:

RAILWAY TRAFFIC
AT A STANDSTILL
Heavy Storms in Moun-
tain States.

EIGHTEEN INCHES OF SNOW
FALLS AT OGDEN.
Loss of Stock in Wyoming, Colorado.
New Mexico and Texas May.
Reach Fifty Per
Cent.
'"\" . - ' . **-â '
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OGDEN, Utah, Feb. Bâ Last night's
snowstorm covered Ogden with sixteen
inches of snow, ; and it kept falling all
day. There is - about " eighteen inches
now and indications are there will be
more snow before morning. Railroad
and street car travel is blocked. There
have. been no trains from the East to
day, though two Union Pacific trains
probably will reach here before morn
ing. A big snowslide near Devils Gate
has practically interrupted telegraph
work and blocked the Union Pacific
again. It is the heaviest snow in Ogden
in fifteen years.
' DENVER, -Feb. B.â A snowstorm rag
ing in the mountains has again tied up
the Colorado railroad lines to the west
to-day. No trains are running on the
Midland, although gangs of shovelers
are persistently keeping at work. Two
passenger trains from the west on the
Denver and Rio Grande were stalled
between Leadville and Buena Vista and
two were held at Glenwood Springs.
Westbound trains do not go beyond
Salida. The Rio .Grande officials say
the main line will be reopened in a few
hours. No further efforts are being
made to clear the South Park tracks
in the vicinity of Leadville. Trains
over the Union Pacific are getting
through, but are behind the schedule.
i J. W. Stringer, secretary of the Con
tinental Land and Cattle Company, re
ceived word to-day from its Montana
and Texas ranches that the losses of
live stock would be very great as a re
sult of the long and general storms and
cold.
"The loss," said Mr. Springer, "will
be general throughout the western
country from Montana down through
Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and
Texas. In some places it will undoubt
edly reach 50 per cent, and will run
throughout 'the country between 10 and
33 per cent. The great loss of cattle
is bound to make high prices during the
year, as the Government's reports show
a shortage, and the demand of the
trade is greatly â  Increased."
FAIR PROMOTERS TO
CONFER WITH SOLONS
WILL SET AFOOT MEASURES TO
SECURE FUNDS.
The Manner of Raising - Money in
San Francisco Under the New
Charter Discussed. .
... A movement will be instituted to-night
at Sacramento looking to the appropria
tion by the State of $500,000 for the Pa
cific . Ocean and International Exposition
in San Francisco in 1901. A measure will
also be s^et afoot authorizing the counties,
cities and counties and municipalities to
make appropriations In furtherance of
the enterprise.
At the meeting of the special commit
tee on appropriations of the exposition,
which met in the office of Charles _Â
Patton yesterday, it was decided that the
committee should proceed to Sacramento
to-day and consult there with the Gover
nor and the members- of the San Fran
cisco delegation in order to ascertain how
best to promote the interests of the big
fair. J. A. Filcher is already In . Sacra
mento, and Charles L. Patton, Mayor
Phelan, Henry J. Crocker, J. B. Relnsteln,
George A. New hall and John Lackmann
I expect to leave to-night.
Among the matters discussed at the
meeting yesterday was the manner in
which the $750,000, pledged to the project
by the Supervisors of this city, could be
raised.. Supervisor Lackmann called at
tention to the provision of the new char
ter, which will shortly be in force, fixing
the maximum tax levy at $1 on each Jim*
worth of taxable property. An examina
tion of the charter, however, discovered a
section which authorized the Board of Su
pervisors, by a unanimous vote, with the
approval of the Mayor, to - increase Â» the
tax levy In case of great necessity or
emergency. .It. was the opinion of all
present that the holding of the fair would
come under the head of a great necessity.
No trouble, therefore, is anticipated on j
this score. . ,
GOOD NEWS FOR ANGLERS.
Fisherman Wilson Shipped Ten Steel
heads. to the Fish Commission
ers From Duncans Mills.
If ' the present fine j weather continues
for. a few weeks longer anglers may hope
for a renewal of the old time sport :on
Russian River. :^ ;.
. Al Wilson shipped a box of steelheads
from ! Duncans Mills Tuesday to the Fish
Commissioners. They were caught on a
spoon while trolling the deep pools within
easy distance of Orr's J Hotel. The fishes
are not large, but It is; expected that a
run of large steelheads -will soon result.
Last â¢ Sunday an angler landed a qulnnat
salmon from the pool at the mouth of
Austin Creek, scaled ; twenty-four
pounds. This Is the first time that a sal
mon > has â¢ been taken ,. from : this Â» river by
net or rod. Three years ago several thou
sand qulnnat fry were placed ln the river
and It is ; presumed . that the capture ; of
this fish will mean grand sport for anglers
in the near future. John Butler, Professor
Terry, Colonel Kellhor â  and * others will
spoon for steelheads on Russian River to
morrow. .'â --- - ' .. 2i â â '

SUPERVISORS
ARE SURPRISED
INTO INACTION
The Spring Valley Water Com
pany Violates Precedent and
Submits a Statement.
Discussion of Water Rates Is Postponed
Until the Members of the Board May
Analyze the Report Presented
for Consideration.
THE Board of Supervisors and \ Mayor)
Phelan were-paralyzed Into official "mac-, ;
tlvity last night by the Spring Valley |
Water. Company.' The board met as a
â¢ committee ."'of; the whole, with Supervisor |
Phelps in ; the chair, to discuss water j
rates. At their last session the Supervis- .
ors had adopted a resolution calling upon .
â¢ the Spring Valley Water Company to sub- .
mit a detailed statement of its affairs, in-'
... eluding, under a tabulation of seven clas
.* si.flcations, the assets. ' income and ".Ha-' j .
billties of the corporation. Such a.state
"â¢ ment, which might be suspected to reveal |
'â¢.valuable corporation secrets, the Spring j
.' â¢ Valley Water Company had positively re
':-fused to submit to former Boards of Su- :
.'. pervisors. The present board made the j
demand, however, as a matter of form, â 
.and, to the surprise of everybody inter- i
- ested, the water company complied with j
' -the demand. â¢ . >- s
.Over the signature of Pelham W. Ames, j
..-the secretary of the Spring Valley Water :
-; Company, a most formidable document
. * was presented for the consideration of |
-.the board. The water company, through !
â¢ .its secretary, went Into the most minute '
' .tSetails of its business, even descending, I
in .its record of financial incidents, to the ;
/cost of telephones and the labor of em
ployes on the roads. Every element of !
revenue to the company was apparently
exploited In detail. All of the alleged ex
penditures found place in the statement, ;
and for the satisfaction of the official '
-'rate fixers a comparison was drawn be- I
.. .tween the financial .condition of the water
. company in 1897 and 1898.
The Spring Valley Water Company had
.never before in its history been so frank j
:.' to. the public, and Attorney Kellogg and j
Herman Schussler fairly bristled with ag- j
gressive importance as Clerk Russell read j
. â¢ the statement of the company. The Su
â¢ pervisors had not expected that such a
'statement would be submitted, and they
were ready to listen to the long arguments *
which it is the privilege of Mr. Schussler j
;. to present to every Board of Super isors.
V ' When, however, the statement was pre- :
- tented there was an uncomfortable hesl- I ;
. ..tuition on the part of members of the
â  'hoard. Supervisor Perrault. who is heard
'. more than he is listened to, was on hla
: feet to object to the reading of the state
â¢: ment until the members of the board i
'. Could be assured that the Spring Valley ,
. Water Company had rendered a detailed ;
â¢ -Btatement. The Supervisor insisted that
'it was unjust to ask the board to pass i
. judgment upon a document of which the j
members had no knowledge and which !
they had not seen before It was presented j
â in Open meeting. Dr. Perrault thought {
â¢ that It would be wise for the board to ad- i
: Journ and digest the statement of the j
â¢water company.
/ Supervisor Lackmann moved that a copy
'.of the statement be placed at the disposal
â¢ -of each member of the board. This mo
â¢ tion was adopted, and Mr. Lackmann
â¢urged that the representatives of the wa
ter company be heard. â¢ In advocacy* of
â¢ his suggestion the speaker said that rep- !
resentatives of the water company usual- i
-.ly consumed several days in talk, and he
. was in a mood then to listen. Other Su- j
. .'pervisors Interjected to urge that it would
: be wiser to wait and listen to the visitors
. understanding^. There was nothing to
â¢ show, they argued, that the statement of j
â¢ the company was in conformity with the .
.- demand of the board, and it would be .
WEYLER ATTEMPTED TO
DEVOUR HIMSELF ALIVE
Horrifying Death of the Premier Hyena
of the Chutes' Zoo.
WEYLER . is . dead. He died a
l/y death as horrifying as ever
I f came to a living creature. In
* ' an agony of distress or in the ;
satisfaction of the j venom j that was
In his nature he . ate his right hind
leg off, and a bullet of mercy ended
f his existence. Some ; say that Wey
ler erred death to the 'Ignominy
of his name. Others insist that his
savage glutting was satiated upon
himself. Whatever the cause may
have been Weyler died early Mon
day morning at the Chutes. "...
Weyler was the premier hyena of
the zoo. He was the animal person
ification of savage cowardice and re
ceived - his name from some one who
had studied the , Cuban war. Weyler
was but : little ' larger than a dog,
dull gray and striped black in color.
He had fangs of cruel whiteness and
a disposition â¢ invariably .to show nis
teeth. X't'-'x â 'â  '-â ". _.-'
A few days ago the keeper of the
zoo noticed that Weyler had- gone
lame. He limped and snarled and

ten knowingly to the agents of the great
I corporation. - . ',
Supervisor Perrault was again on his
feet to protest against any: reception of
the agents of the water company. In
! the excitement of â  the moment. Dr. Per
i rault addressed Mr. Phelps as ."his honor',
! and immediately apologized for the seem
ing reflection. Dr. Perrault very solemn
.ly..inqi*ired. of Attorney,. Kellogg If the
statement of * the Spring "Valley Water
Company as submitted was In detail. Mr.
Kellogg replied that the document was a
j "detailed statement generally," whatever
that may-mean.* Mr. Kellogg added that
the company had not tabulated the cost
of lead pencils, but its statement was in
i evidence, and needed no elaboration for
I intelligent consideration of the board.
Mr. Kellogg's elucidation of the affair
had a disturbing effect. Several motions
were made, but the chaiftnan recognized
I one to adjourn. He put- the motion, which
, was carried by a vote of 7 to 4. The board
I then stood adjourned until to-morrow
i night at 7:30 o'clock, when it will resume

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL., THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1899.
SAYS DR. ROBINSON
THREATENED HER LIFE
Charge Made by
Mrs. Meta
Wrede.
FRUITS OF A SCANDAL
MOTHER AND DAUGHTERS AT SWORDS'
POINTS.
Former Objects to the Physician's
Alleged Attentions to Her Off
springâParent's Accusa
tion Denied.
"I have pleaded with your "dead father;
I have pleaded with your wife; now I In
tend to lay the case before your mother."
"If you go to my mother I'll kill you."
The first speaker was Mrs. Meta Wrede,
mother of a family of children ranging
in ages from 8 to . 28. - The threatening
retort which followed her strange state
ment was made, so she claims, by Dr.
Frank B. Robinson, son of the late Dr.
Luke Robinson.
After making the alleged threat, Dr.
Robinson, according to Mrs. Wrede, drew
an ugly-looking dirk from his pocket and
threatened to use it if she carried out her
intention of bearing tales to his mother.
The stormy Interview took place at the
home of Mrs. Wrede, at 2026 Pine street,
about a fortnight ago, in the presence of
her three daughters, Birdie and Edith,
charming girls of 18 and 21 years, and
Mrs. Millie Pierce, who is only a few
years older. Dr. Prank Pierce, Mrs.
Wrede's son-in-law, was also present. The
row had been brewing for some two years
and was occasioned, so Mrs. Wrede states,
by Dr. Robinson's undue attentions to her
daughter Edith.
At the culmination of .the scene. Mrs.
Wrede made her escape to another v por
tion of the house, where she remained
until the next morning. .Then Dr. Robin
son, she claims, remained at the house
also until the next day. Then Mrs. Wrede
gathered up her belongings. and took ref-

uge with a friend at 418 Golden Gate ave
nue, where she is still staying. Â
Edith Wrede, Mrs. â¢ Millie Pierce, the
latter's husband and Dr. Robinson, are
very much disturbed over the sensational
allegations made by â¢' Mrs. Wrede. ' They
all freely admit, however," that a quarrel
occurred at the Wrede home, in â¢ the heat
of which some burning .words were ban
died back and forth, but they strenuously
deny i that Dr. Robinson threatened to
take Mrs. Wrede's life. . She ordered Dr.
Robinson to leave the house, they say, but
none of them saw the doctor flourish a
knife.
The day. after Mrs. Wrede left her home
she disposed of the furniture, carpets and
household fixtures, leaving the handsome
two-story structure as bare as -Mother
Hubbard's , cupboard. The : daughters are
deeply, incensed at their mother: actions,
and Dr. Robinson continues to be a regu
lar visitor at Edith ' Wrede's : desolate
home.
When seen yesterday afternoon by a
Call reporter Mrs. Wrede. was still very
much wrought up over the affair. At flrst
she was reluctant * to " : furnish the details
concerning her quarrel with -Dr. Robin
son, but finally she made the following
statement
" "Dr. Frank Robinson, although he â . Is a
married man, has been keeping company
with my daughter for a period , of two
years, during which time he ; has 'been : a
constant visitor at my home on Pine
street. His, visits were extremely dis
tasteful to me. I knew he had a loving
wife and two children, and I did not fancy
his making love .to *â¢ Edith, and more
than once I requested him to keep away.
He paid little heed 'to my wishes, and for
that matter neither did Edith. She loved
him blindly, and '. all 'â  my pleadings with
her were in vain. She â  remained away
from, home, when she: first became ac
quainted - with Dr. Robinson, \ for several
days at a time. When she would return I
'always ' scolded her, .but she was : of â  age
rand thought she.was. able to, take care of
: herself. "â¢--.â¢.*?'â¢-! â â¢ â  : â¢ '.:,'VI-- x-i"; .-â  â¢ â ***.â¢ â â¢-,- ,. -*'
"The doctor kept . coming . to â¢ the - house
and. finding that my protestations had no
effect I ; finally decided to : tell . his â  father,
the late Dr. Luke. Robinson; and accord
ingly did. so. He expressed - great ' sorrow
at his son's waywardness, and ; promised
to do what he could to put a stop to the
flirtation. â¢ ;
"I don't know what passed â  between
father and - son, but at ' any rate Dr. Rob
inson did | not * stop paying court ito Edith.
r Things went. on and Edith left home
again. I then decided to tell Mrs. Rob
inson of ; her husband's : . unfaithfulness. â¢â ' * 1
called on her and asked if the doctor was
at home. . She told Ime that , her * husband
â¢had not been home for several nights. *.*.- 1
told her of his behavior with my daughter
MISS EDITH WREDE, Who Claires the Doctor
Was Oo*y Her "'Friend:...
and she was sadly surprised. When
Edith returned home again I told her that
1 had been to Mrs. Robinson's. ...
' "The night the trouble occurred Dr.
Robinson and Dr. Robert Murphy called
at the house. After a heated quarrel I
ordered Dr. Robinson from the house and
he refused to go. Then I told him if he
did not keep away from my home, as a
last resort, I would lay â¢ the . matter be
fore his mother. Dr. Robinson then flew
Into a rage, and, quick as a flash, drew a
dirk from his pocket and threatened to
kill me lf I did. I was* terror stricken for
the* moment, and hastily made my escape
downstairs into another part of the house.
I, remained out of sight the entire night,
for I feared that Dr. . Robinson might
make , good his â  threat. In â¢â¢ the .'morning
he was still at the house, so , I. picked up
my belongings and came down here to
stay with my friend.:;
"My daughters, took Dr. Robinson's
part, so I could not stand It any longer.
When I left the house I told them that I
intended to report- Dr. Robinson's. assault
on me to police headquarters, but on sec
ond consideration, I decided to -let the
matter rest. I have no* desire at this time
to cause him any trouble. ' .
Out at 2026 Pine street, in a magnificent
and imposing residence, destitute, of all
furnishing, Miss Edith- Wrede lives with
her sisters, Mrs. Millie Pierce and Miss
Birdie Wrede. . \ : â "â *'
A strange picture of elegance and desti
tution is their home. The ' vast apart
ments, with their exquisite fresco- work,
are carpetless and* bare â¢â¢ of furniture.
There are no beds in the* house. - A few
wooden stools and chairs, together with
several kerosene lamps, make up the sum
total of the household goods. -
The story of. Dr. Robinson's alleged,as
sault upon Mrs. Meta -Wrede was em

Pierce and Dr. Pierce, all of 'whom have
a. long tale of woe based on the suffering

to leave the house, and when he did' not
go she left .the' room." * ::â ::â . ;
Mrs. . Pierce .- corroborated . her . * sister's
statement. ; â "â¢_'*"â¢* .xyz.x ';â ;.-< .- -/â¢ .-.-..'-.â¢< 7
"Much as it pains me to have to say, so,
I feel-; I \ must - not 'keep** still under the
existing: circumstances,'' Mrs. Pierce ex
plained." "To *> foreclose *a - . mortgage of
J5590; mother 'has caused this, house to be
sold right â  over â  our ; heads. J All | the I fur
nishings, piece by piece, she has sold,' and
when she finally, left 'the house she gave
my sisters and Birdie %l each. â¢ Since
then I have seen nothing at 'her. and have
no ' desire *to ever lay - eyes â  on ; her *, again.
When she left she-took* with her the three
minor ' children; Cbrdlna, ' aged ; 15*; years;
Alvina, aged > 13, -and Walter, aged -8. 1 For
more than I two years she has not sent
the little ones to school and now they
are. allowed to play upon the streets from
morning until night. We have the chil
dren come up here during the day, and
the -little food we have we gladly share
with them.
"We were, once upon a time very well
to-do,'.' continued Mrs. Pierce. "My moth
er, however, by her ruthless extravagance
and sporty company, ruined my father,
and about fifteen months ago he deserted
her and the family. He is now in Stock
ton, but makes no effort to do anything,
either for himself or for us. He is par
tially paralyzed and blind of one ' eye.
Mother, in a quarrel, scratched his eye
out."
Dr. Pierce spoke in the highest terms
of Dr. Robinson, and declared Mrs.
Wrede's attack upon his good name and
fair. fame not only unwarranted and ma
licious, but a most ungrateful return* for
many benefits . received. . ,*
"Dr. Robinson has been a true, kind
friend to ; the Wrede â¢ family," said Dr.
Pierce, "and many is the time the little
\v redes would have gone supperless to
bed if It had not been for the bounty of
the doctor." '
Son-in-law and daughters are unan
imous in agreeing that Mrs. Wrede, al
though to all- outward seeming a
charming and agreeable woman, is pos
sessed of an* ungovernable temper, and is
never bo happy as when engaged in a
quarrel or a good hand-to-hand fight.
All the girls tell tales of scratched faces,
blackened eyes and hair-pulling matches,
and Mrs. Pierce claims that even; her po
sition as a matron did not exempt her
from a fistic encounter with her mother.
The mother's latest alleged escapade
and her reported attacks upon* Dr. Robin
son- they are inclined to look upon as the
natural results of undesirable associates.
"Mother's company is not 1 what it
should be," said Mrs. Pierce. "Her inti
mate friends are Mrs. Grace Hummelten
berg and; Mrs. Cummlngs of 418 Golden
Gate avenue,. and I do not consider their
Influence good." X'--- â â â "â :
"Yes, and there are some prominent
men, too," exclaimed Edith Wrede, "and
perhaps If I would make public their
names they might explain what they have
done with the money, mother gave them."
t Mrs. Pierce threatens to call the atten
tion of the Society for the Prevention of
â elty Â«A*? Children to the sad condition
of her little brothers and sisters.
Dr. Frank Robinson, when seen late
last, night, emphatically denied that he
had ever drawn a knife upon Mrs. Wrede
He characterized her as a â  dissolute
blackmailer," and said, although there
had been a quarrel between them, no
weapons had been displayed.
v-? c disclaimed any undue intimacy with
Miss Wrede^and was anxious to â ane it
plain that -} e _ as merely on. terms of
friendship with the family.
GOOD HARD FIGHTING.
Bouts at. the San Francisco Club That
Pleased One Thousand Spectators.
The San Francisco Athletic Club â¢ gave
its monthly fistic show last evening at
the clubrooms,* on Sixth street, before a
large gathering of sports, with the fol
lowing results: "Yank" Calahan defeated
Tom Smith in a four-round bout. "Kid"
Johnson and Charley Vlckers boxed six
â¢rounds, which ended in a draw. "Kid"
â ?Â£ c -?_} d e - anticipating an easy game met
Kid Hilton, a.sturdy little fellow, who
returned blow for blow and came very
near putting McFadden to â  sleep in the
fourth and fifth rounds. McFadden held
the winning cards in the first, second and
third rounds. Referee Jimmy Lawler de
clared the bout a draw, much to the dis
gust of McFadden. R. E. Woods, a pupil
of Professor Watson,* stopped T. Tiernan
In the third â¢ round of a six-round bout
J. Jeffords, a very promising heavy
weight, hammered Pat Mclvinew so hard
.for two rounds that the authorities in
terfered and the referee. Alex. Greggalns
decided in favor of Jeffords, a 205-pound
aspirant for honors.
