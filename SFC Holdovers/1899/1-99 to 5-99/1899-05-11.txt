: Uowing: As an In-
JL 1 dlcation of the confidence of the
administration on the approach
ing close of the rebellion in the Philip
pines, I learned to-day that orders have
been given to Admiral Dewey to send
the cruiser Boston to San Francisco
and to place the Isla de Cuba, Isla de
Luzon and Don Juan de Austria, when
completed, in reserve at Cavite, The
dispatch of the Boston to San Fran
cisco is undoubtedly due to the desire
of the department to give the people of
the Pacific Slope an opportunity to
greet one of the cruisers which fought
iri the battle of Manila Bay. The Ral
eigh came home through -the Suez ca
nal; the Hympia, with Admiral Dewey
on board, will return by the same route,
and the authorities think it only fair
that the next home-coming cruiser
should be sent to San Francisco.

battle of Manila â the Baltimore,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
APIA, Samoa, May 4 (via Berlin,
May 10). The difference which arose
regarding the line outside of which the
Mataafans agreed to withdraw has
been peacefully adjusted, and work has
been resumed on the plantations near
Vailele.
All the houses in the neighborhood of
Apia are still strongly occupied by
Tanu's warriors. Tanu has lodged
complaint with the Supreme Court
against the administration of the
Treasury, which is now controlled by
the insula of Germany, Great Britain
and the United States, pending Dr.
Solf's assumption of the duties.
Tanu demands that he be paid a
monthly salary of $150, which is thrice
the amount paid to Maliotoa Laupepea,
The United States Consul, Lieutenant
Osborne, acting as cashier of the
Treasury, refused to pay the money de
manded, but the Chief Justice, Mr.
chambers, gave judgment in favor of
Tanu for the amount claimed.
CATHOLIC KNIGHTS OF
AMERICA IN COUNCIL
KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 10.â
Catholic Knights of America who met in
annual council here to-day, with nearly
every State represented, resumed the old
fight over the question of admitting wo
men to membership almost as soon as
the convention had been called to order.
The law committee came before the con
vention with majority and minority re
ports the majority favoring the admis
sion of the women. At the morning
session consideration of the reports was
temporarily postponed, hut in the after
noon tho matter was laid before the con
vention, and then began a I .bate that
lasted until late to-night, when a vote
was taken and the women were again
defeated. The final vote was 274 in the
affirmative and 178 In the negative. As
the proposed amendment required a two
thirds majority to carry the champions
of the wom^ii were vanquished.
An effort to reconsider the vote will be
made to-morrow.

The date of the departure of the Bos

A determined effort is being made by
the Pacific Slope to have Admiral

with telegrams from ciues. Boards of
Trade, etc., from all over the country,
informing him of their intention to give

WILL DROP
SILVER AND
FIGHT TRUSTS
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
NEW YORK,. May 10.â Former Gov
ernor William J. Stone of Missouri,
when he came to New York a few days
ago had another mission besides that
of warning Eastern Democrats who
bolted in 1896 that the doors of the next
Democratic National Convention will be
barred to them, as told in The Call to
day. This second mission was to in
vite the Western men's pick of the
Eastern flock to attend a big anti-trust
dinner that is to be held In St. Louis
on May 25.
To that dinner Stone has bidden at
least two New Yorkers who are not tied
absolutely to the theory of 16 to 1, on
which Stone says Bryan will be re
nominated. One of these is Augustus
Van Wyck, who, while he supports the
Democratic ticket, is a bimetallist and
a believer in the idea that Congress is
the body that should settle the cur
rency question. Another is Oliver P.
Belmont, who has traveled with Bryan,
and whose name is brought back to
New York by every Western and
Southern Democrat who comes here as
that of one who may run for the Vice
Presidency on Bryan's ticket.
Belmont is confessedly a gold Demo
crat. Ho has said so many times, but
each time he has rounded out the
period with a saving clause, which
stated that lf the majority of his party
should decide in favor of free silver
he would stand by the majority.
Van Wyck has been asked to speak
at the anti-trust dinner. Stone is the
active spirit back of the anti-trust din
ner, which Bryan will attend, and
Democrats in the East look to it to
result in making of him national chair
man to succeed Senator Jones, who is
in poor health.
Eastern men also regard it as a
change in the tactics on Bryan's part.
It will force to the front the issue that
they think is the most Important of
any suggested for a platform.

for their kindly offers and stating that
the admiral will have an opportunity
after his return of enjoying the hospi
tality which it is proposed to extend to
him. So far as the proposition for the
Olympia to return to San Francisco is
concerned, the matter rests in Admiral
Dewey's hands, and he has signified
his intention of coming home through
the Suez canal. The department will
not give him any instructions in the
matter, and it has no reason to believe
that he contemplates making a change
in the route he will follow on his way
home. Secretary* Long has been in

months ago, learning of the welcome
awaiting him, said he was afraid to

AN EXTRA
SESSION TO
BE CALLED
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May lo!-The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel*
egrapha: I have the authority of a
member of the Cabinet for the state
ment that the President before he left
Washington had practically made-up
his mind to call Congress together in
extraordinary session about the 20th
of October. He has discussed the mat
ter with members of the Cabinet and
some of the leaders in Congress. In
his interviews with the latter he made
no declarations as to his intentions. He
simply asked their views. He has found
a difference of opinion among legisla
tors, but members of his Cabinet gener
ally agree with him that it would be
advantageous to the country and the
Republican party to have Congress
called together a month or two earlier
than usual, ln order that several big
questions to be brought before it may
be disposed of in time for adjournment
before the nominating conventions next
year. â¢ ; .'y.-y.;. -',
The President wants the policy of the
Government In respect to the Philip
pines and other colonial possessions
thoroughly defined and ' the currency
question disposed of before the next
campaign. These are the â¢ governing
considerations, but there are minor
reasons for beginning Its work on Oc
tober 20, instead of December 4.
Congress will be able to organize and
make considerable progress with its
work before the holiday recess. If de
ferred until December the President
fears the session will be prolonged until
la^e In the summer with many of the
questions which the administration is
anxious to have out of the way still
pending while the nomination conven
tions are in session. He expects to
have his policy in respect to the future'
of the Philippines fully outlined early
in October.
Long before that Admiral Dewey will
be here with a preliminary report from
the. members of the Schurman Peace
Commission. It has already been ex
clusively stated, in the Herald that the
commission favors a form of govern
ment for the Philippines modeled after
our own. In brief, its plan contem
plates the appointment by the Presi
dent of a Governor, with a Cabinet to
consist of leading Filipinos, a Judi
ciary, also to be appointed by the Pres
ident, and a Legislature to be elected
by the inhabitants, who will have the
right of suffrage subject to. property
and educational qualifications.* This Is
the form of civil government which
will favor the / basic principles of the
commission's recommendations , and
which has already received the appro
val of the President. â¢ .ay

FILIPINO CONGRESS
MEETS AT SAN ISIDRO
Although Those Present Are Parti
sans of Aguinaldo, They Express
Strong Desire for Peace.
MANILA, May 10, 7:30 p. m.â
Reports received from the in
surgent line, which, however,
have not been confirmed, say that a
meeting of the Filipino Congress has
been held at San Isidro. There was
no quorum present, but in spite of
this fact some business was transact
ed. The reports add that although
those who attended were mostly par
tisans of Aguinaldo, a strong desire
for peace was expressed.
Major General Mac Arthur will prob
ably remain at San Fernando until
fresh troops can be forwarded to him
from this city to replace some of the ,
volunteers who have become exhausted I
from the long campaign. Filipino rifle
men to the number of 8000 are in- I
trenched on three sides of Bacolor. The
Americans. however, are fully able to
held the city if Monday's attack was a
specimen of the enemy's fighting
ability.
The Filipino General Mascardo's
army, Inspired by wine taken from the
storehouses of Bacolor and by the gen
eral'^ oratory, on Monday evening at
tacked San Fernando. There was tre
mendous yelling and a great expendi
ture of cartridges by the rebels, but
very little result. General Maseardo
holds the outskirts of Bacolor, west of
the railroad. In front of his positions
are the Kansas and Montana regi
ments, which occupy trenches that the
Filipinos built In anticipation of an at
tack from the direction of the sea.
. During the afternoon of Monday
General Maseardo, with a large retinue
of officers, rode along the lines, fre
quently stopping to harangue his war
riors. At dusk a detachment of rebels
rushed toward the outposts of the
Montana Regiment, but were met by
a hot fire from the Montana -Regiment
line. The insurgents from trenches
nearly three miles long responded.
After an hour's firing, during which
one private soldier of the Montana
Regiment was wounded, the insurgents
subsided, although they - kept up a
scattering fire throughout the night.
Prisoners who were brought into the
American lines said that General Mas
eardo distributed barrels of wine
among his soldiers, telling them that he
expected to capture the city of San
Fernando. The trenches undoubtedly
saved the Americans from heavy loss,
the bullets falling thick about them
during the engagement.
General Luna Is massing his army
east of the railway," bringing up troops
by trainloads In sight of the American
lines. The country between San Fer
nando and Calumpit is filling up with
natives who profess great friendship
toward Americans, but who are sus
pected by many of sympathy with the
insurrection. A Filipino connected
with the American Hospital Corps was
killed, it is supposed, by amigos, so
called.
The army tlnclad gunboats Laguna

mand of Captain Grant, steamed up the
Rio Grande to Calumpit to-day, clear
ing the entire country of rebels from

COST OF PRODUCING GAS.
1 Figures Which Tell How a Monopoly
I Manages to Plunder the People
I and Absorb Rivals.
88
,â¦. â  1 fr /HEN the people of San Francisco ascertain the real truth regarding the cost of pro
â¦. \l\l during illuminating- gas they will not be surprised that the old San Francisco Gas
*. V V Company has been able to destroy competition by the absorption of rival companies.
â¦ Should some enterprising expert or Supervisor tabulate from the municipal reports the
V amount annually paid by the city during the past twenty-four years for lighting streets, pub
â¢s lie buildings, schools and engine-houses the record of the aggregate amount disbursed would
25 startle the taxpayers. When the sums collected from private consumers can be added to the
*â¢ enormous amount collected from the city the plundering propensities of the corporation may
j* be fully revealed.
ft The profits in the manufacture of gas, aggregating millions, have enabled the company
S5 to water its stock from time to time and finally pay dividends on a pretended investment of
ss thirteen million dollars.
85 A great outcry is now made because the rate for supplying gas has been reduced to
85 Si i o per iooo feet. The Call is prepared to show that immense profits can be legitimately
85 realized at that rate.
85 The expense of manufacturing gas for the Agnews State Hospital can be cited as an
*â¢ example. The engineer of that institution studied the figures submitted by the San Francisco
â¦ Gas and Electric Company. His own practical tests for one year demonstrate clearly that
V gas in a limited quantity can be produced for 55 or 60 cents per 1000 feet. As the quantity
? increases the cost per 1000 feet diminishes. Here are the figures of cost and production at
â¦ Agnews from January Ito December 31, 1898:
% j Coal used. 271 tons; gas made, 2,124.640 feet; surplus coke, 80 tons; tar, 50 barrels.
Â§ Cost of one bench of retorts â Retorts, $151 freight, $180; setting same, $100; total,
? $431 48. One bench of retorts lasts about two years, hence $215 74 is calculated for as the
V cost for one year. The cost of coal is placed at $1957, which, added to the cost of one bench
5 of retorts, gives the sum of $2172 74 as the total cost for the year.
s Â§ A rebate of $850 is derived from the sale of 80 tons of coke at $10 per ton and 50 bar-
V reis of tar at $1 per barrel. Deducting the rebate of $850 from the foregoing cost, $2172 74,
â¢5 the sum of 322 74 stands as the actual cost of producing 2,124,640 feet of gas. The en
-B*s gineer computes that the cost is between 55 and 60 cents per 1000 feet.
â¦ The cost of distribution to householders is not here computed. It must be taken into
â¦ consideration, however, that production on a vast scale would place the cost of manufacture
1 much below 50 cents per 1000 feet.
*â¦ Considering the enormous tax placed on the people of San Francisco for light and
H water, it is a wonder that any progress has been made by the city.

Â© NEW YORK. May 10.â The Herald's Washington correspondent Â©
â¢* sends the following: President McKinley proposes to make a tour of the g
% West during his coming summer vacation. Arrangements for the trip g
*â¢> have not yet been perfected, but it is understood that he will go to 'â ?,
& San Francisco by the Southern Pacific route and return over the North- &
a crn Pacific. He will leave about the middle of July and be gone prob- g

â 65 There is no doubt that the President will take advantage of the trip Â§â¢

it is intended, will give the natives self
government, co-operating with the mil

FIVE-STORY WAREHOUSE
DESTROYED BY FIRE
One of the Brave Firemen Comes in
Contact With Electric Wires
and Is Killed.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.. May 10.â The big
five-story warehouse of the Newby Trans
fer and Storage Company at 1216 and 1218
Union avenue was destroyed by fire to
night. The loss is estimated at over
$100,000.
James F. McNellis, a fireman, foreman
of truck company 4, was killed. After the
falling of a rear wall McNellis and five
other firemen went in upon the debris
with a line of hose. The foreman came
in contact % with a live electric wire that
had been carried down from the roof of
the building and was killed.
The hanging wire struck McNellis on j
the forehead and the shock caused him to
plunge forward into a network of live I
wires, where his companions saw him die.
Two of the firemen were severely shocked !
in their efforts to recover the body. Mc- j
Neills' face was terribly burned where the j
flesh had been in contact with the wires. j
The fire, which is supposed to have
started in a boxcar that had been run into
the building on the company's switch, had
gained such headway when the firemen
arrived that all they could do was to keep
the fire from spreading to the other build
ings in the wholesale district. The de
stroyed building, which was owned by
Frank Deardorf, was valued at $23,000 and
was insured for $15,000. Members of the
Newby Company estimate the value of
the contents at about $SO,OOO and say there
will be little salvage.

MILES SEEKS
W. J. BRYAN'S
INFLUENCE
The General Yet Has a Hope
of Securing Congressional
Action on Bad Beef.
â â¢ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, May 10.â A Washington
special to the Inter Ocean says: Gen
eral Miles is observing the letter but
not the spi* t*. of the obligation to ac
cept the report of the army beef court
of inquiry as final. He still talks to
friends about a "packed court" and
they are quietly working for Congres
sional investigation. William J. Bryan's
influence has been sought. It is stated
on good authority that even before the
report was made public Miles com
municated with Bryan and suggested
to him the political advantage of Con
gressional investigation, pushed by
Democrats, expressing the belief that
enough anti-administration Repub
licans could be found to vote with the
Democrats to secure such an investiga
tion.
It was pointed out to the silver leader
that the people would be with Miles re
gardless of whether or not he was vin
dicated by the inquiry board and that
this influence could be used to advance
the interests of the young Nebraskan
if he openly espoused the cause of the
general, who was being persecuted by
men responsible for killing soldiers
with bad beef. Whether Bryan took
notice of Miles' letter is not known.
Champions of Miles are determined
the beef controversy shall not be
dropped. They are encouraged to think
Miles has won a point in the Presi
dent's decision to drop the whole af
fair with the report and continue Miles
at the head of the army. They declare
the President was forced to t*his con
clusion by a fear of alienating a large
number of Republicans who joined
Miles in his denunciation of the War
Department. They feel they have thor
oughly intimidated a majority of the
Cabinet into the belief that it will
never do to make a "martyr" of Miles.
They declare that Miles having exert
ed enough influence to prevent his re
moval from the position of major gen
eral in command, even after such an
arraignment against him as the find
ings of the court, the same fear of his
popularity and the same influence in
the Cabinet can be used to drive Sec
retary Alger from the head of the War
Department. They insist that as the
two officials cannot work in harmony
one of them must retire for the good
of the service, and that the President,
fearing to remove Miles, will be forced
to intimate to Alger he should retire.
They claim that they have flve mem
bers of the Cabinet who will urge upon
the President the necessity for har
mony and a new Secretary of War who
can co-operate with the general in com
mand, assuming that Miles is now un
der no oollgation to co-operate with
the present Secretary of War, and that
by refusing to do this he can force2

that Woodland Parlor has maintained such a healthy growth.
Secretary Alger to retire.
Friends of Secretary Alger, on the
other hand, say he is satisfied with the
report, and will continue the same
policy followed from the beginning of
the war, adopting the suggestions of
General Miles where ho regards them
as wise, and ignoring them where he
finds them in conflict with his own
idea- or those of the President. He
will do this in the future, as in the
past, without fear or favor, for he is In
â¢i position to direct the War Depart
ment without the aid of General Miles,
and only the President can overrule
him
Should there come a time in the fu
ture when Miles shall attempt to have
the Secretary overruled Dy the Presi
dent, then Secretary Alger will refuse
to submit to Intimidation, and will
maintain his self-respect by surrender
ing the portfolio. He has stood between
the President and enemies of the ad
ministration for many months and
taken abuse that was meant for and
in fact applied to the President. But
he will not submit to being used as a
means of reconciling .Mi.. and creating
harmony with an insubordinate offi
cial. If the President wishes a Secre
tary of War who will truckle to the dis
credited major general in command he
will have to find another man, as Gen
eral Alger will not do so.

CINCINNATI, May 10.â The En
quirer to-morrow will print the follow
ing Interview with Hon. H. R. Pro
basco, ex-United States Attorney here,
a relative of ex-Secretary Sherman,
and recently counsel for General Miles:
When the court convened, having pre
viously served General Miles as counsel
in other matters, i was asked to go to
Washington and confer with him as re
garding the proceedings before the Court
of Inquiry. I was determined that, inas
much as General Miles was not in the
attitude of one accused, that it would be
ill-advised to introduce a lawyer, and
Major J. A. Lee was selected by General
Miles, the court and the recorder.
Did you take any active part before the
court?
My only connection with the case was
the conferring with General Miles and
Major Lee regarding the summoning of
witnesses and the examination of the
most important ones.
What is your opinion as to the report
of the Court of Inquiry?
I have not read the full report, but I've
seen the synopsis of it. I was amused
that so intelligent an array of officers,
sitting as a court for several week and
examining several hundred witnesses,
should have rendered such an illogical
and uncertain decision. The decision
amounts to the court finding that the beef
packers were saints sent to our soldiers
with manna from heaven, and that Gen
eral Miles was careless because In- did
not report the first vague rumor which
came to his ears that this food was had.
Every witness condemned in unstinted
term! the so-cnJbd canned roast beef as
an unfit ration. The chief clerk of the
commissary general's offlce testified that
canned roast beef in IS7B was used as an
experimental r.'itlon, and â -..;> adversely
reported on after a short trial. The court
was evidently so well satisfied as to the
proof of the truth of General Miles' alle
gations as to canned roast beef that
when, shortly before the testimony closed
they were asked to subpena a list of 134
additional witnesses, they declined to sub
pena all except ten, for the reason that
the 124 would give cumulative testimony
only against the canned roast beef.
What was the embalmed beef?
Before bids were received by the com
missary general, he was advispd by ex
pert cattle and 1..-, men that fresh beef
would not hold up twenty-four hours
after delivered from the refrigerator in
the climate that prevailed In Florida and
the West Indies, and that the best course
to pursue would be the purchase of beef
on the block or beef on the hoof. He
told these gentlemen that the parties who
desired to furnish the beef bad a pro
cess which they said would enable them
to deliver meat which would keep sound
and fresh for seventy-two hours after
delivery from the refrigerator. The day
after the bids were opened attorn* i in
Washington addressed a communication
to the Secretary of War. making the ar
gument that notwithstanding their
clients' bid was somewhat higher than
the others, that they ought to be award
ed the contract because of their ability
to perform their contract by means of
the Powell process for the preservation
of meat, which they controlled and which
had been satisfactorily tested under the
â 'iispices of the Government. This latter
has referred by the Secretary of War
tn the commissary general for his con
ation, who returned it to the Secre
tary with his Indorsement, In which he
said: "These tests are not the only tests
which have been made," leaving the plain
inference that the other bidders also had
processes for the preservation of meat,
which had been tested.
This letter was returned by the Secre
tary of War. Dr. Daly's testimony that
he had found by chemical analysis of
meat furnished the soldiers that it con
tained chemicals, was ln no wise con
tradicted. Three witnesses. Sergeant
Mason, Lieutenant Gampher and Dr. Cas
tle testified that the agent at Lakeland,
Fla., had told them that they had found
It Impossible to comply with their con
tract to deliver fresh meat which would
remain sound and sweet for seventy-two
hours after delivery from the refrigera
tor without the means of a chemical pro
cess, which process was a secret, even
to him. If the court found in the face of
this testimony that no meat delivered was
chemically treated, it amounts almost to
stultification.
Has there been any change in the man
ner of supplying troops with fresh meat
since this criticism was first made?
Indeed there has. Cattle on the hoof
are now being delivered in Cuba, slaugh
tered on the island and delivered to the
troops the following day and no complaint
has been made. Furthermore so-called !
roast beef was dropped as a meat ration
some time. I think, in last August or Sep- '
tember; all of which shows that ton.
Miles' reference to the method of supply
ing the troops with meat was an experi
ment was correct, and that hi opinion
that beef on the block or on the hoof
is the only suitable fresh meat ration for
troops was well founded.
Is there anything else in connection
with this matter?
Yes, the great majority of the papers
and of the people, including the President
(I know this from a conversation with
him about three weeks since) believe that
General Miles would not make a state
ment concerning any person or circum- '
stance which he did not honestly believe
to be well founded and true. General
Miles has no political ambition whatever,
and no more thinks of being a candidate
for President or any other office titan 1
do.
Mr. Probasco blames the Secretary of
War and the adjutant general with op
posing the general commanding the army. i

RECORDER ELMORE
GETS THE BOOKS
Shasta County Surren
ders Mining- Record.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, May 10.â Board of
Supervisors to-day established a prece
dent that may be followed in all of the
mining counties of the State. An order
was made turning the district mining
records, which had become a part of
the county records, back to the Dis
trict Recorder of the Flat Creek min
ing district. Before the enactment of
the State mining law, which was re
pealed by the last Legislature, Waldo
Elmore was District Recorder of the
Flat Creek district, and when the State
law was enacted he turned over all
the records in his possession to the
County Recorder. A short time ago
he filed a demand on the County Re
corder for a return of the records of
his district. County Recorder Lowdon
consulted Superior Judge Sweeny, with
the result that Elmore was instructed
to apply to the Board of Supervisors,
as the records which he desired re
turned had become county property.
To-day the board acted favorably on
Elmore's demand. This action is re
garded as strictly within the law, es
tablishing a precedent that must be
followed in all-like cases in this county
at least. There is a diversity of opin
ion as to the effect. It is argued that
the turning back of the records to Dis
trict Recorders will in many cases re
sult in chaos with mining titles, while
on the other hand it is asserted that
a claim not worth patenting Is amply
protected until such time as its worth
or unworth may be proved by develop
ment work. The Flat Creek district is
the only one so far affected by the
order of the Supervisors.
The Board of Supervisors to-day
acted favorably on the proposition to
span the Sacramento River at the
mouth of Spring Creek with a steel
wagna bridge. The bridge was peti
tioned for by the residents of Keswick
and the Old Diggings district. It will
facilitate the transportation of flux
ores to the smelters and otherwise ac
commodate a great many people.
ASSAILANT OF MRS.
GERLACH ON TRIAL
SAN RAFAEL, May 10.â Frank Rey
nolds of San Anselmo was on trial before
Justice Rodden this evening on a charge
of disturbing the peace and using vulgar
language, preferred by Mrs. Anna Ger
lach of 1313 Golden Gate avenue, San
Francisco. The evidence showed that
Reynolds tried to kill Mrs. Gerlach with
a knife and later shot at her and her
daughter and a young man named Isadore
Berthelot with a shotgun.
Mrs. Gerlach is the widow of Dr. George
Gerlach and at his death was willed a
large estate, containing, among other
parcels of property, a house and lot in
San Anselmo. This she deeded to John
Reynolds, a clerk employed by Sanborn
& Vail, with the proviso that two rooms
of the house Should be reserved for her
own use In the summer of each '-ear as
long as she lived. Frank Reynolds, t_e
father, occupied the house. Because Mrs
Gerlach would not give him money, ac
cording to the testimony, he forbade her
to enter the house. She went there on
Dewey day with her daughter Anna and
Berthelot, ho is an employe of the
Spring Valley Water Company, and was
assaulted by Reynolds with a khlfe. Ber
thelot defended her and told the fright
ened women to flee while he held the in
furiated assailant. He then joined them,
but Reynolds followed them and dis
charged a shotgun in their direction.
Justice Rodden has taken the case un
der consideration and will render judg
ment next week. Mrs. Gerlach asserts
that she will sue Reynolds for the prop
erty on the ground that the provisions of
the deed .of gift have been violated.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. May 10.â According
to news received to-night by the steamer j
Cottage City, the town of Skaguay had a*
wonderfully narrow escape from destruc
tion by fire on the morning of Thursday, ;
May 4. ( The Skaguay Alaskan says it is
generally conceded by every citizen of the
gateway city that it "was only by a mere 'â 
Providential accident of the elements that
[ the fire did not wipe out the entire town
; and leave all the inhabitants huddled at
; the end of the wharves or on the side
' lulls awaiting the arrival of the first boat
for relief from destitution or starvation."
This, says the Skaguay paper, is no ex
aggerated picture.
All that remained of a once thriving
business block of seven buildings In the
heart of Skaguay when the Cottage City
left was a heap of smoldering ashes,
burned tin cans of all sizes, tools and
other metal arl teles, burned and twisted
out of shape, together with other debris
that make up the ruins of a great fire.
Every particle of wood was reduced to
! ashes, and barring the debris the ground
was as bare as before the first building ;
I was erected.
The fire started in the Moyer building.
It Is said that a family named Broemser,
who had a flat in that building, moved out
the day before and left open a connection
in the stovepipe leading to the roof. The
sparks from the lire in the store low
flew out through this opening Into some
Inflammable material. The floor being va
cant, the fire got a good start before it
was discovered. When 'first seen the
flames had hurst through the roof of the j
Mover building.
Citizens hurriedly gave the alarm and
I Skaguayans responded to the clang of
' the fin bell. The volunteer fire depart
ment and the hook and ladder company,
aided by numbers of willing workers, were
soon at work. Before they could get a
stream on the building the flames leaped
across Into the building occupied by the
Brown Shoe Company. The conflagration
had then gained considerable headway,
and on it went, licking up one building
after another until the whole block of
seven structures was razed.
The owners and the names of the build
ings destroyed, excepting the Moyer
i block and the Brown Shoe Company,
could not be learned. Mr. Moyer esti
mates his loss, including stock and build
' ings at $8000. The shoe company's losses
will amount to over $20,000. The total loss
by the conflagration is variously estimat
ed by the Cottage City's passengers at
from $40,000 to $SO,OOO.
i While the Cottage City was In port
: everybody was congratulating everybody
else in the escape of the town, and the
firemen were being loudly praised for
having confined the tire within the
burned block. Had there been the least
wind, it is said, nothing could have saved
the town. It Is not known whether the
burned district will be rebuilt this sum
mer, as several of the owners are away
and as yet know nothing of the loss they
have sustained.
After the Are the Skaguayans began an
agitation for better fire protection, rhe
Skaguay Alaskan says that had the city
a chemical engine, when the upper part
of the Brown store was discovered blaze,
they would have been able to confine the
fire" to the upper part of it and saved
$15,000 worth of Roods, winch now are a
total loss. The water supply was very
poor, the pressure being quite inadequate.
While the fire was in progress Ed Drew
quarreled with Joe Bunyan and spat in
his face. Bunyan seized a bottle and
struck Drew on the head. Drew then
ran outside, and picking up a rock threw
it through the glass door at Bunyan.
Bunyan attacked Drew with a hatchet,
Inflicting a serious wound. Bunyan was
arrested. Drew is in. a doctor's hands.

McGLADE WILL
PUT IN HIS
DEFENSE TO-DAY
Not Many Witnesses
to Examine.
â â¦ â
The prosecution has closed its testimony
against Peter W. McGlade, ex-bookkeeper
in the Street Department, accused of
forging demands for salaries. The last
witnesses for the people were excused
just before noon yesterday in Judge
Cook's department of the Superior Court.
Patrick Reddy, attorney for the accused,
asked and was granted the afternoon to
prepare his instructions and get the de
fense in form, premising to rush his wit
nesses through to-day.
The first witness for the prosecution
yesterday morning was Charles B. Trull,
bookkeeper for Bier & Regensburger, the
warrant brokers who cashed the bogus
Street Department demands. Trull tes
tified that he was familiar with Mc
<'lade's signature, and he identified it as
the one attached to various orders of
Identification offered in evidence. On be
ing shown three of these orders, those
bearing the names of C. Murphy, J.
Tierney and J. Sullivan, he testified that
he was in the offlce of Bier & Regensbur
ger when they were presented. Further
on he said he, had had conversations with
McGlade concerning the warrants repre
sented by the orders. On all three occa
sions, the witness said, Met 'lade had
given him cash Instead of warrants on
the treasury. He thought this strange, as
it had been Md 'lade's custom to turn over
warrants altogether.
"On the 17th of August, 1898," continued
Trull, in answer to a Question, "McGlade
told me he had just collected the warrant
of C. Murphy. He gave the amount of
that warrant in coin to me. I asked him
also for the warrants of J. Tierney and
J. Sullivan and he told me they were not
ready at that time."
On October 4, Trull said. McGlade paid
him $100 for the warrant of J. Kelly.
"He asked me," continued the witness,
"to go outside Into the corridor to count
the money, as he did not want any of the !
men in the offlce to see me counting it."
It appeared from the cross-examination
that McGlade's attorney was not enam
ored of the witness. He could not swerve
the young bookkeeper from his original
testimony, however, whereupon he moved
to strike out part of Trull's evidence, and
noted an exception to his tone of voice.
"The court," said Judge Cook, "can
not strike, out the tone of voice of a wit
ness."
Mr. Reddy agreed with his Honor, and
after calling the attention of the Jury to
what he considered offensive in Trull's â 
tone he excused the bookkeeper.
Joseph E. Bier of Bier & Regensburger
identified the handwriting of McGlade on
several of the forged orders; and M. J
de la â  Montanya. a clerk in the Treas
urer's offlce, testified that warrants for
the demands of <". Murphy, H. J. Swords
and J. Sullivan had been paid.
The trial will be resumed this morning
at 10 o'clock. '
SKILLFUL WORK
OF FRESNO FORGERS
FRESNO, May 10.â The arrest last
night of W. E. Bushing, the de
tective, on a charge of having ut
tered a forgery, was the chief
topic of conversation on the
streets to-day. Officers agree in pro
nouncing the alleged forgery one of the
most skillful on record. The perplex
ing question is how Elmer Geddes knew
that Edwin Geddes had an account in
the l,; in and that he signed his name
"I", Geddes." There is a very simple
and plausible explanation. The two
men being of the same name, and both
living in the same part of the county
at one time, it is more' than likely
Elmer Geddes opened a letter intended
for Edwin Geddes, but addressed sim
ply "E. Geddes," and delivered to him
through a mistake. Depositors fre
quently write to a bank inquiring how
their accounts stand. If Elmer Geddes
received the bank's reply he, of course.
knew all about the deposit, and the
similarity of the names might have
suggested the crime.
It is not known how Elmer Geddes
learned how to duplicate his name
sake's signature, but, of course, he

IN MURDOCK CASE
Conflicting Views as to
Chircgraphy.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, May 10.â When court con
vened this morning the defense in the
I Murdock note case asked for the privi
j lege to recall James Boyd and W. E.
Bowles. Boyd testified that he knew
.lames McConnell, who, W. E. Bowles tes
tified, was at the State fair in 1887. Mc-
Connell had worked for him before he
left Willows. Boyd had never seen him
at a State fair in Sacramento nor had
he seen William Murdock there. He
1 would have seen both men had they
been there. On cross-examination by
Johnson Boyd said he was certain about
this.
W. E. Bowles followed Boyd. Me*W*as
asked by I,usk if he had not, before he
, left Willows years ago, been arrest..; here
for extorting money from women and
Chinese and if he had not left Willows to
avoid trial for the offense. Attorney
i Johnson said this was "a very Improper
question and a witness should be allowed
: to strike down an attorney for such an in
sult. He asked the court to protect the
witness and not allow the question to be
answered. The witness had already an
swered "No." Judge Pirkey said he
would allow this question, as the witness
i bad already answered, but he did not
, want any more of the kind. The witness
started an explanation of his having been
: arrested, but was immediately stopped by
Attorney Johnson.
Mr. Knock was called to give expert
testimony in regard to the measurement
of. the angles in "Wm." of the note and
the 1890 deed, from which the defense
claims the signature on the note was
traced. He said he had had many years'
experience as a civil engineer and had
: made a close study of surveyors' lines and
degrees: he had examined the seventy
nine photographic signatures of William
j Murdock and the signatures to the note
I and deed, and had discovered that the
. "Wm." of the deed and the "Wm." of the
â  note were not alike.
"There is not a line in the 'Wm.' of the
j deed and the 'Wm.' of the note that cor-
I respond, with but one exception, and
I that is the first stroke of the 'm' of both
I 'Wm's.' "
Expert Knock explained many differ
ences which he said he found between
Other letters of the two signatures. The
testimony of Mr. Knock contradicts al
most all of that given by Experts Ames.
Kytka and Eisenschimel. Mr. Knock had
made several tracings of the different sig
natures, which he used in his demonstra
tion. He said lie did not believe the sig
nature of the note was traced from the
signature of the deed.
Mis. T. J. Kirkpatrick was recalled. She
had been at Mary Helen Murdock' house
lon September â '. l v *> 7. She went there to
pick some geese, which Mrs. Murdock had
left in her charge for the feathers. Mrs.
Murdock was at home and the witness
was much surprised to see her there, for
she thought she was at Allen Springs.
She remembered the date, as her house
burned three days after that. Mr. Nei
deffer's child died about that time.
James P. Matlock, Dr. West, H. P.
Andrews, W. A. Fish, Charles F. Foster,
1.. W. Valentine and a. L. Conard, all of
Tehama County, testified that, the general
reputation of Ashurst was good. Here the
plaintiff rested.
Mrs. Smith, a daughter of G. Murdock,
deceased, was called by the defense to
prove that Mary Helen Murdock was at
Allen Springs on September 7, 1877. She
was positive of this. A number of wit
, nesses bad testified that Mrs. Murdock
was at her Stoney Creek ranch on that
date. Â«
Allen Henry and wife of ChiCO testified
â  that the plaintiff was at Allen Springs on
September 6, 1877, the day the note is said
. to have been signed and delivered to the
plaintiff at the Stoney Creek ranch.

VIOLATED FISH LAWS. '
SAN RAFAEL, May After an excit
ing chase Deputy Fish Commissioners
Davis and Mathews succeeded to-day in
capturing eight Chinese fishermen engaged
In a violation of the fish laws at Point
San Pedro. Over three hundred pounds
of small fish were secured as evidence.
The Flsh Commissioners were some dis
tance away from the Chinese, who were
in two large junks, when they perceived
them hauling in their nets. They gave
chase and sent the launch Quinnat
through the water so rapidly that the
occupants of the junks were, forced to
release several nets and let them sink
with their finny freight. The fish ob
tained as evidence were small sole, and
completely filled a rowboat towed behind
one of the junks. \
The Chinese, with their boats,- were
taken to San Quentln and thence brought
to this city by rail. Here charges were
preferred against them* by Mathews in

WINNEMUCCA, Nev., May 10â Miss
Anna C. Egan. teacher of the. Indian
school at the Shoshone reservation, Dr.
A. A. Meriwither, physician of the res
ervation, and F. W. Carson are having
their examination at this place by the
United States Commissioner, charged
with an attempt to murder Indian Agent
Mayhugh and a reservation employe
named Myers. The trouble dates back to
last month, when Miss Egan's work was
Interfered with by Myers and Mayhugh,
and she drew her revolver upon them, it
is alleged in self-defense.
The prosecution had a number of In
dians on the stand to-day, whose testi
mony was conflicting and unimportant.
Mayhugh testified that Miss Egan had
drawn her reveolver on him and Myers
and that Dr. Meriwither had taken the
weapon from her hand ami tired it at him.
Myers testified that he had simply tried
,to frighten Miss Egan, but that Miss
Egan would not be frightened.
Miss Egan testified that Mayhugh and
Myers had come to the schoolhouse and
demanded that one of the pupils be given
up. They had reached for their weapons
and she drew her revolver to defend the
pupil who was under her charge. When
Dr. Meriwither appeared on the scene he
took the pistol from her hand and fired at
the agent and Myers.
Dr. Meriwither testified that he found
Miss Egan, revolver in hand, confronted
by Myers and Mayhugh, who were draw
ing their weapons. He was unarmed, but
he took the pistol from Miss Egan's hand
and fired at the two men in defense
of the woman.
Mrs. Meriwither testified that through a
telescope she had seen Mrs. Mayhugh arm
her husband before he started for the
schoolbi
The case goes on to-morrow. Miss Egan
is a woman of gentle demeanor, who does
not look like one who would engage In a
gun fight. Public sentiment is against
Mayhugh, who has had much trouble at
the reservation. The Indians are excited
over the affair.

WINDSOR'S CRUSADE.
Citizens Seek to Close a Disorderly-
House.
SANTA ROSA. May 10.â Reilly and
D. Nash, proprietors of the resort known
as the Hotel de Windsor at Windsor, a
few miles north of this city, were ar
rested this afternoon and charged with
keeping a disorderly house.
The arrest is the result of a mass meet
ing of Windsor citizens held several days
ago to protest against allowing the place
to continue in operation. A committee of
citizens was appointed to confer with the
District Attorney. Upon his advice di
rect evidence was obtained and the ar
rests followed. For years the place in
question is said to have caused great an
noyance to Windsor people. The resort
is situated directly across the- road from
the public school and the citizens' com
mittee alleges its influence is anything
but beneficial to the pupils. The present
proprietors are comparative strangers in
Windsor, having taken charge less than
three weeks ago. They came from San
Francisco.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, May 10.â Chief of Police
Kid ward has accumulated enough evi
dence to prove thai Frank Raymond,
who is charged with having looted Ar
chitect "Wolfe's residence, is none other
than "The Borer,' whose mysterious
operations in this city for the past five '
months have baffled the authorities.
Besides being guilty of grand larceny
and burglary, Raymond will have to
answer to the United States postal au
thorities for having robbed the Frohm
postoffice.
Raymond was stylish in his opera
tions. Whenever he started out to com
mit a burglary he always stole a horse
and buggy and rode to and from the
place. This rule was invariably carried
out. The police records show that on
every night a burglary was committed
a horse and buggy were stolen.
On December 22 last Dr. Gates horse
and buggy were stolen, and that night
three houses were entered. A day or
two later the robes from the rig-were
found in a house next door to where
Raymond resided. "The Borer" always
gained entrance to houses by boring out
a panel in the door.
At the burglary of the Willow Glen
schoolhouse a note was left behind.
The writing and spelling correspond
with Raymond's, as did the chiroeraphy
left after the Frohm postoffice burg
lary.
Chief Kidward has done some skill
ful work in the case, Raymond had
committed fifty burglaries, and timid
women had become so alarmed that
husbands were compelled to remain at
j home evenings.
TERRILL GIVES HIMSELF UP.
SAN JOSE, May 10.â Attorney Samuel
B. Terrill, who was Indicted yesterday
by. the Grand Jury for forgery and em
bezzlement in connection with a bogus

day and gave himself up. The bail is
$3000 on each charge. â¢rill made no at
tempt to give bonds, and to-night is In
jail. He has engaged several attorneys
and it is thought he ill attempt to ob
tain his release on a writ of habeas cor
pus, holding that he cannot be tried for
this offense when extradited on another.
Terrill will have his preliminary exam
ination to-morrow afternoon on a charge
of having embezzled 1300 from the Chris

HAY CROP A FAILURE.
LOS ANGELES, .Way 10.â It i- said that
' the hay crop has failed almost com
pletely in the San Fernando Valley. The
I rain came too late. A county horticul
tural inspector has just returned from
an official visit to that section and brings
back dismal reports. One of the big hay
ranchers expects to get no more than
fifty tons of hay from 2000 acres this sea
son. Another will be surprised if the crop
from 5000 acres of the best hay land in
the alley amounts to more than 100 tons.
Much of the bay is not up high enough
to mow at all, and many of the ranchers
: will not do any haying this season.

REUNION OF THE
CONFEDERATES
Question of the Care of
Their Dead Discussed.
Special Dispatch to The CaU.
CHARLESTON, S. C. May 10â
m si the first official art of the ninth
annual reunion of the United Confed
erate Veterans, which began its ses
sions to-day, .4*5 an attempt by Gen
eral Stephen D. Lee of Mississippi to
secure an indorsement of President Mc-
Kiuley's suggestion, made in his re
cent Atlanta speech, that the care of
the graves of Confederate dead should
be undertaken by the Federal Govern
ment- Action on the resolution was
frustrated by a motion to refer it to
the committee on resolutions. As this
committee is yet to. be appointed it is
not probable that the matter will be
taken up to-morrow, and the ultimate
fate of the resolution is problematical.
The motion to refer originated with Dr.
J. W. Malone of Virginia and met with
some opposition.
T. ii. Busbee of North Carolina
thought the resolution should be re
ferred. Jt wouid do do harm to refer
aiid no disrespect Â»a- Intended. Every
loyal Confederate appreciated the cour
tesy and good intentions of President
McKinley in what he had said at At
lanta. "But," Mr. Busbee said, "there
ought to be a distinction between the
graves in the North, between graves
in Chicago or Columbus and those on
the fields of Virginia and the South.
There is a difference between the
graves and their care. Here there are
those who willingly and cheerfully take
care of the graves of the noble heroes
(pointing in the direction of the boxes
filled with idles). In the North and
East there may not be these loving
hands, and that is why 1 say there is
a distinct!'
After this it was decided without
further discussion that the resolutions
be referred to the committee on resolu
tions.
A conservative estimate places the
number of visitors at between 25,000
and 35.000.
When John B. Gordon, the comman
der-in-chief, appeared before the con
vention he received a tremendous ova
tion. The old Confederate chieftain was
presented by General Walker and de
livered an eloquent address. When he
closed General Gordon led Mrs. Stone
wall Jackson to the front of the stage
and she was enthusiastically ap
plauded.
The parade of the veterans occurred
this afternoon and they marched
through a dense crowd of cheering peo
ple, Jed by Generals Gordon and Wade
Hampton, along the line of the grizzled
old warriors.
At intervals alone the line the flut
tering of a war-worn and shot-torn
flag called forth cheers, while many
heads were bared as the frayed em
blems of a dead cause gleamed over
some organization whose name Is a
household word to the South.
Hampton and Gordon were cheered
vociferously at every step and rode
almost the entire route with bared
heads. The absence of General Wheeler
in the line was a source of considerable
disappointment. II. â¢ reached the city
early to-day, but did not participate in
tin: jjarade.
SURVEY ORDERED FOR
TRANS-PACIFIC CABLE
* VICTORIA. B. C. May 10.-Matters are
going forward toward the establishment
of the trans-Pacific cable. A week ago
the government of the province of British
Columbia wrote to the Ottawa govern
ment ring to contribute (1,000,000, a
ninth of the cost of the cable. To-day
the news is given on good authority from
Esquimau; the British naval station on
tiiis coast, that ','. M. S. hi eria, Captain
Smythe. is to be commissioned within a
few lays to survey for a cable between
British Columbia and New South Wales.
The Egeria is tho survey ship of the
North Pacific fleet. She is now engaged
in surveying the Inland waters to the
north of British Columbia, making new
charts, which will be very valuable to
vessels in the Alaskan trade. An officer
of the Amphion. one of tho warships now
in port, said to-day that efforts had been
made to get a larger vessel, as the Egei ia
was rather small for the service, but ow
ing' to the delay that would be occasioned
in bringing such a vessel around the
Horn the admiralty have decided to com
mission the Egeria.
Th.* route chosen, said the officer, would
be an all British one. It would extend
from Victoria to Norfolk island, or per
haps Tonga, and then to Sydney, New
South Wales. The cost of the cable will
be borne as follows: Canada, $4,000,000*
British Columbia, $1,000,000; â¢Victoria'
Queensland, South Australia and New
Soul Wales each $1,000,000.

STONE HURLED AT
OPEN CAR WINDOW
SAN JOSE, May 10.â In all probability some hoodlum who attended
the picnic of the Electrical Workers of San Francisco in this city last
Sunday will be called to answer to a charge of murder. Miss Lillian
Post, an 18-year-old girl, who resides on San Carlos street, near Pro
vost, has a fractured skull and is lying at death's door because of a
ruffianly act of some picnicker. The girl had been on a visit to friends
in San Francisco and left there on the 6:30 train for home. The ex
cursionists were met at Burlingame, and as the^trains passed some one
hurled a stone through an open window. It hit Miss Post on the head.
Her skull was fractured and she was rendered unconscious. A stop of
twenty minutes was made at San Mateo and the railroad physician
there attended Miss Post. She was then brought to her home and Dr.
Gussim is attending her for the railroad. Miss Post is suffering from
concussion of the brain and has been unconscious most of the time. The
chances are against her recovery.
It is said the railroad company has taken the case up and that de
tectives are at work looking up evidence to sustain a charge of murder
or assault to murder, as it may turn out.
WIFE'S AFFECTION
TAKEN FROM HIM
Fresno Man Sues for
Damages.
â â¦ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, May 10.â Andrew M. An
derson, a well-known citizen of this
county, has created a sensation by fil
ing in the Superior Court a suit for
$10,000 against George Smith on the
ground that the latter Alienated his
wife's affections.
In the complaint Anderson makes
two specific charges against Smith,
and on each asks for judgment in the
sum of $5000. The flrst is that on May
25, IS9B. while he and his wife. Theresa
Anderson, were living together happily,
the defendant "contrived to injure the
plaintiff and to deprive him of the
love, comfort, society, aid and assist
ance of his wife, Mrs. Anderson, by
maliciously enticing her away from the
plaintiff's home and residence in the
city of Fresno to a separate residence."
The second charge is that in June
of last year Smith and Mrs. Anderson
were surprised at the Fresno House in
this city.
As both of the principals are well
known citizens, the filing of the suit
has stirred up a sensation in society
circles.

Attorney of Having Presented
False Claims.
MARYSVILLE. May 10.â At the in
stance of District Attorney E. P. Mc-
Daniel of this county, H. H. Love, the
expert accountant employed by the Grand
Jury, was arrested by Sheriff Bevan at
his home in Palermo this morning on a
warrant charging him with having pre

ln violation of section 72 of the Penal
Code, Love Was arraigned before Justice
Garber. He entered a plea of not guilty
i and asked for time to consult his counsel,
whereupon the court set next Tues
day for the preliminary examination and
fixed the defendant's bonds at 53000. These
were given by John C. White, Harold
Comfort li and S. H. Bradley, business
men of this city.
it Is alleged that bills died by Love ,
i with the Supervisors contain charges for
services as expert on days when he did
not work. The District Attorney claims
he had two detectives watching Love
during March and April, and it is on their
evidence and on the testimony of persons :
who will swear that Love was at "his
Palermo home on those days that he
i hopes to obtain a conviction.
_ As the Grand Jury Investigated the mat
ter before adjourning and refused to In- .
diet Love, the latter*, friends declare the
action of the District Attorney was
prompted by his personal hatred of Love,
who, in his report as expert, made state
ments not to Mr. McDaniel's liking. .*;

Call Headquarters, Wellington, Hotel Washington, May 10.
Assistant Secretary of War Meiklejohn denies saying the Chinese
exclusion act does not apply to Hawaii and that they may enter "there
unrestricted. The solicitor of the Department of Justice recently ren
dered an opinion that the Chinese exclusion act did not apply to those
Chinese residents of Hawaii who were visiting China when the United
States acquired Hawaii, but in all other respects the law applies. Dur

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1899.
FAIL TO RAISE
THE ANDELANA
Five Tugs Haul at the
âº Sunken Ship.
a
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MM a. May 10.â An attempt was
made this afternoon to raise the sunken
ship Andelana. which turned turtle
during the high wind on the night of
January 13. Her steel cable and anchor
having been recovered, arrangements
were made to attach five powerful tugs
to the recovered cable In an attempt
to drag her into shallow water, her
present depth of 200 feet being too
great to permit of divers working. At
3 o'clock this afternoon the Andelana
was taken hold of by the big tugs Tyee,
Wanderer and Holyoke, assisted by the
smaller tugs Fairfield and Favorite.
Four hours were spent in pulling, but
almost without result.
The largest two tugs broke their
14-inch Manila cables soon after start
ing, causing them to shoot out toward
the shore as though they were hauling
a plaything. On shore this was taken
to mean that the Andelana had been
lifted and was being beached. What
had actually occurred was not known
until the tugs docked late to-night.
The tugs, working together, exerted a
horsepower of 4000. The Wanderer and
Tyee let out considerable slack cable
several times and then drove ahead at
full speed.. It was believed that this
would dislodge the sunken vessel, but
the efforts were fruitless. It was while
making these attempts that their
cables parted.
The operations of the tugs were di
rected by Captain John B. Libby, gen
eral manager of the Puget Sound Tug
boat Association.
No doubt now remains that the An
delana is stuck fast in the mud at the
bottom of the harbor. Soundings show
that the mud there is not over three
feet deep. To-morrow more barges will
be sent out and efforts made to dislodge
her by means of powerful donkey en
gines, making use of the rise and fall
of the tide, If she is dislodged ln this
way the tugs will be recalled from Port
Townsend and another attempt made
to pull her ashore.
An important result of the raising
of the vessel will be the recovery of th***
bodies of Captain Stalling and thir
teen seamen.

the Waterloo station last night the
private saloon contain*- Seth Low and
Captain Mahan, delegates to the Peace
Conference; Mrs. Low, Frederic Hoi
11s, secretary, and Frederic Morrison,
disbursing officer.
The party was met by Mr. Carter,
second secretary of the American Em
bassy, and drove from the station to
their hotel immediately.
Mr. Low, when asked by the Herald
correspondent in regard to the state
ment that England and America would
join in advocating international arbi
tration at the conference, said he could
not say anything on the subject at the
present moment. Captain Mahan also
declined to express himself.
I understood, however, that interna
tional arbitration will be the principal
point studied by the international Com
missioners at the Hague, and it is
quite possible that the subject may oc
cupy their deliberations for possibly
two months.
The general impression is that while
the English and American delegates
have not received identical instructions
they will take the same line at the con
ference. ;'./'-."-":

luncheon party at his house on Friday

Sir John Fisher and other British dele
gates to the conference will be pres

The Duke of Devonshire, Lord Presi

of the Central Association of Bankers,
said that while Great Britain's expend- j
itures had been enormous any less
financial preparedness would have
lessened her chances of amicable agree
ment with the United States, France
and Russia.
England's armaments, he declared,
had made arbitration over the Venezu
ela controversy possible and had pre
served the most amicable relations
with the great republic. It would be
asking too much to expect that all
these treaties would lead to universal
permanent peace, but what had been
done shows that Great Britain recog- i
nized the responsibilities resting upon ;
her and was willing to use her power
and wealth rightfully.

SACRAMENTO, May 10.â The Capi
tal City Wheelmen, who have a
strong and Influential organiza
tion, arc greatly exercised to-
night over a press dispatch from
Stockton charging them with miscon
duct in connection with last Sunday's
relay race between this city and Stock
ton. Some years ago a valuable trophy
was put up to promote a spirit of
rivalry between the fast riders of the
two cities. Stockton proved herself un
able to keep up with the pace set by
Sacramento, and the result was that
the Capital City Wheelmen managed
to score three victories, thus entitling
them to the possession of the coveted
trophy. The final came off last Sun
day. The race was a close one and
the finish, which took place at the
Stockton end, gave Sacramento the
prize by only a few- yards.
According to the dispatch which has
given rise to so much indignation here,
an empty carpet-tack box was picked
up on Park street, Stockton, and is now
in the possession of the Terminal City
Wheelmen. The dispatch declares there
INDORSES TOE NEW
ADMINISTRATION
La Patria on Reforms
at Havana.
â â¦ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, May 10.â La Patria, one of
the best edited papers in Havana,
comes out to-day with an editorial
strongly indorsing the American ad
ministration. Its utterances are re
garded as representing the best
thoughts of the thinking element of the
community. The editorial says in
part:
If any shadow of doubt could remain
as to the absolutely imperious necessity
of the expulsion of the old Spanish regime
in order that Cuba might have true lib
erty and progress, it must vanish when
one analyzes the series of phenomena de
veloped before our sight day by day. We
are eliminating traditional impediments
and getting rid of the apparently impas
sable obstacles which four centuries of
evil training in political administration
had thrown in our path.
La Patria goes on to contrast the
American method with that of the
"obstinate Spanish" in dealing with
even the simplest reforms. On this
point it says:
Formerly there was agitation among
the people; oceans of Ink and tons of pa
per were used; goods of oratory were
poured out, and then everything ended at
.Madrid in the froth of Spanish promises.
On the other hand, in these days of fruit
ful though silent work we learn of the
most radical reforms when they are pub
lished in the Official Gazette without be
ing preceded by a magnificent conglom
eration of oratory and colored fire. An
order of six lines with a very short pre
amble will represent some bold and benefi
cent measure. I might say that for us a
thin sheet of paper separates the medieval
world from the nineteenth century, and
oftentimes the writing is not indispensable
to enable us to pass from darkness to
light.
As an illustration of its argument La
Patria cites the separation of church
and state and draws a picture of "the
wild parliamentary scenes" that would
have occurred if such a subject had
been agitated in the thirteenth century.
"Yet this has been accomplished," it
says, "by the Americans, and through
this a thousand enormities have been
effaced."
Senor Perfecto Lacoste, Mayor of
Havana, with the approval of Major
General Ludlow, will issue a decree
prohibiting the wearing of undershirts
exposed that is, uncovered by outer
shirts or coatsâin public places, door
ways, windows or balconies, under pen
ally of imprisonment at hard labor ln
the discretion of the court. As team
sters, mechanics and most laborers are
accustomed to work in undershirts, the
decree is likely to increase the use of
profane language among the lower
classes. It is a revival of the munici
pal ordinance of 1894, which had not
been enforced. Another decree has been
issued prohibiting smoking in street
cars and omnibuses. With reference
to the latter, La Lucha will say to
morrow that such an order is "petty
and unreasonable among a population
devoted to tobacco."
PALM OFF OLEOMARGARINE.
CHICAGO, May 10.â Fear of social deg
radation keeps many a millionaire of Chi
cago from acknowledging the fact that he
uses oleomargarine in lieu of pure butter,
according to William Brodwell, a witness
before the pure food investigation com
mittee to-day. .'yyy. '- : yyy :
"It's the strangest kind of a game, the
witness said to Senator Mason, "this de
ception that is going on simply because
a man is too proud to let his friends know
that he is using anything that is not the
real article. It would surprise you if you
could learn of the millionaires that come
into my store every lay and carry home
their little package of oleomargarine and
then palm it off on their swell friends as
the real butter."
Mr. Broad well was called* before the
committee to explain why the internal
revenue laws regarding the stamping of
all packages of oleomargerine were not
enforced.
SECRETLY WEDDED.
SANTA ROSA, May 10.â Among the ar
rivals on the Southern Pacific train this
morning from Sacramento were Allison
B. Ware Jr. and wife. Mr.' Ware, who
ls a son of A. B. Ware, the local attor
ney, was married several weeks ago in
Sacramento, but this was not known by
his relatives or friends here until his ar
rival this morning. The bride was for
merly Miss Maud Boyd and resided in
the capital city. The groom for the past
two years has been attending the uni
versity at Berkeley and was a member of
the class of 1901. Â-:
is evidence that the tacks were pur
chased in Sacramento and strewn along:
the path for three or four miles, either .
by some Sacramentan or other person
having an Interest in the winning 0_
the race.by the Capital City Wheelmen.*
J. A. Woodson, president of the Capi
tal City Wheelmen, declares it is out
rageous that such a message should
have been sent out. He adds these
rather interesting charges against the
Stocktonians:
"We have it upon excellent authority
that there was trickery on the part of
the Stockton people. Wilson, who was
the trailer for Hirsch, one of the relay
race riders, was told at Stockton that
the Sacramentans would be done up.
He was told that tacks would be placed
on the track. Wilson was warned to
be on the lookout, and, of course, there
was great precaution. Notwithstanding
this, however, some tacks were picked
up. They were scattered along the road
for a distance of four or more miles."
The Capital City Wheelmen assert
that the record of their club is clean,
and that the character of the men who
represented the local riders in last
Sunday's race is a guarantee of the
honesty of the event, so far as Sacra
mento's participation in it is concerned.
GAGE SURPRISES
THE POLITICIANS
Unexpected Appoint
ments Made.
â â¦ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, May Governor
Gage this morning appointed the fol
lowing as members of the board of
trustees of the State Normal School at
Los Angeles; R. H. F. Variel. Henry
W. O'Melveny, N. P. Conrey. Los An
geles; John S. Collins, Ventura, and E.
J. Louis, San Diego.
LOS ANGELES, May 10.â Governor
Gage has surprised the politicians at
this end of the State by his appoint
ments of trustees to the Los Angeles
Normal School. Assemblyman Conrey
is the single member of Governor
Budd's board to be reappointed. His
name had been withdrawn by the Gov
ernor from confirmation by the Sen
ate last winter, along with other Budd
appointees. Besides, Conrey voted in
Sacramento for Robert N. Bulla for
United States Senator, and not for
Colonel D. M. Burns.
The Governor's appointment of E. J.
i Louis of San Diego appears to be in
the nature of a reciprocal arrangement,
i as I. B. Dockweiler of this city has been
! named as trustee of the Normal School
| in San Diego.
Henry W. O'Melveny is a well known
' lawyer who was two years ago a gold
: Democrat. He and the Governor have
\ been personal friends since boyhood.
R. H. F. Variel is a brother of the
chairman of the Sixth District Republi
can Congressional Committee. John S.
Collins is a well-known resident of
Ventura County, a banker and Mayor
of the town of Ventura.
It was expected in political circles 1
that among the trustees of the new j
board would be Professor Molyneaux j
of Pomona.
YOUNG HEROES PAY THE
PENALTY FOR GREATNESS
Lads Who Saved Lives ht a Fire Are
Made Principals in a
Kissing Bee.
SAN RAFAEL, May 10.â The osculatory
feats of Lieutenant Hobson were rivaled
; to-night at the residence of Capitalist
William G. Lichtenberg, the occasion
! being the presentation of badges to his
i two sons, William and Rudolph, for their
1 heroism in saving the lives of Principal
Hitchcock's little children at the Selborne
School fire on April 23. All the ladies
present participated in the kissing bee,
and most of them were not content with
once pressing the boys' lips, leading
Judge Morrow to observe that Hobson
had set a precedent likely to be carried
to a point where a prohibitory law would
soon be a necessity in order to afford the
heroes of the male sex a chance for their
: lives. . vy: ;y â * y
i The badges were presented by Colonel
I Parnell in behalf of the California So
. ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children, and Captain H. A. "Gorley
pinned them on the boys' coats. Judge
Morrow then delivered a brief address,
in which he said acts of heroism were
not confined to the battlefield of Manila
; at the present time, the case of the Lich
tenberg boys forming a shining example
of the truth of his remarks.
] Both boys acknowledged their gratifica
tion at the feeling manifested, but were
i inclined to think they had done nothing
but their duty. It was then that the kiss
' ing began, and fifteen minutes were spent
at it. As soon as the address of Miss
( Bltimfield can be learned the society will
award her a medal.
I Among those present were: Colonel W."
R. Parnell. Captain and Mrs. H. A. Gor
ley. Officer McMurray of the society, Mr.

â Recreation Led Her Com
pany Out â Three Choices
Won at Oakland.
The crushing defeat of Dare II In the
mile and a quarter -handicap at Oakland !
yesterday was a Bad blow to the knowing |
ones financially. Tho chestnut horse, with ;
Ruiz In the ---addle, had a very extensive I
following, which backed him for a "mor- |
al" at even money. Ruiz trailed the .
bunch, and if his mount had any speed
he was unable to make him put it to any
use, finishing last but one. After leading ;
to within a few yards of the wire, Em
Ftein was overtaken and beaten out by
Major Hooker, a 10 to 1 shot, well ridden
by Jack Ward.
Of six favorites Flamora, Sly and No
via wero the winning ones. Johnny Reiff
landed one of the long shots In Whale
back, which defeated Jennie Reid in a
very exciting finish. -
Ed Purser's filly, Flamora, met five
youngsters of inferior quality in the first
event, and at odds of 1 to 4 was only
slightly played. After leading all the way
she was hard ridden to beat Jennie Riley
a length. Surfeit ran a distant third.
The Undertakers' Relief Corps did noble
work in the sprint that followed, over
tlie Futurity course. Amasa, the favor
ite, with Ruiz up. was carefully nursed,
but life was soon extinct and he was not
in the front rank at the finish. The well- j
backed Recreation won driving, a head
before February, ridden by "Nutcracker"
Steward.
In a head finish Sly. the 5 to 2 favorite,
downed Wyoming a head for the third
purse. Socialist and Imperious, the pace
makers, had enough of it when the stretch
was reached. Ruiz, on the lirst choice,
gradually assumed the lead, md outrid
ing Tullet, on Wyoming, earned the ver
dict. Hahn. on amela, secured the
show honors.
Johnny Reiff, aboard the 10 to l shot,
Whaleback, dropped from clouds, snatch
ing the fourth race by a scant head from
Jennie Reid. Festosa ruled favorite, but
stopped badly when half the distance had
been covered. Glover, with the leg up on
Jennie Reid, looked to have the race well
in hand th last sixteenth, when Rein
came with a rush, winning on the last \
stride. Rey Hooker was third.
The fast mare Novla had nothing much
to beat in her race, winning hands down
at short odds. Silver State took the place
from P. A. Flnnegan.

A POOR MISSIONARY
NOW A MILLIONAIRE
4 T~*t EV. EDWARD MORGAN, late assistant rector of the Mission of the
-> i-J Good Samaritan on Second street, is now a millionaire. By the death
5 I I of an aunt in New York he comes into a fortune that will enable
*Â» -*â  *- him to give full play to his love for missionary work without any
> thought for the dollars and cents that are so necessary in such an under
-3 taking.
4 The Rev. Edward Morgan was born in Bantry, Ireland, about thirty-four
5 years ago. His father was a general in the British army and ids only brother
â¢ was a captain In the Life Guards. Both father and son retired from army
Â£ life some years ago and are now living on the family estates. Very wealthy
"5 relatives of the Morgans live In New York, and with one of themâ an aunt
> âthe Rev. Edward was a great favorite. He visited her frequently and fin
â¢* ally about five years ago decided to make America his home. After a short
Â£ stay in the East he came to California and then went on a roving expedi
'4 tion into Mexico. Finally Ms thoughts turned to the church, and return
"s ing to New York he entered a theological seminary. He went through a
L? three years' course of study successfully and then came back to California
1 and Identified himself with the Arm it age Orphan Asylum at Ban Mateo.
'-> During his stay there he was ordained a deacon of the Episcopalian church.
*Â» Rev. Edward Morgan's aunt was Miss Jane Morgan, a wealthy and tal
-? ented resident of Staten Island, New York. She was better known as
"i "Midy" Morgan, and twenty-five years ago was stock editor of the New York
SS Times. About that time site planned her home in Staten Island, which is

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 11, 1899.
"CITY'S PLAGUE
SPOT" NEARING
CONDEMNATION
An Action in Eminent
Domain Filed.
â â¢ â _
A HUNDRED DEFENDANTS
I
â â¢ â
ALL MUST APPEAR AND PLEAD
TO THE COMPLAINT.
1
Within Six Months Dens of Vice \v ill
Doubtless Be Pulled Down and
Work Will Be Commenced
on the Park.
â¦
The city's plague spot surrounding St.
Mary's Church will soon be a matter of
history, and where the dens of vice once
flourished a beautiful park will existâ a
place where the people living in the
crowded tenements of that district can
enjoy their time and watch their children
play.
Suit was filed yesterday on behalf of
the city and county to condemn the en
tire lot of land between California. Pine,
St. Marys and Dupont streets. This will
wipe out Quincey street and nothing will
remain In that block but the buildings
facing on Kearny street. The proceedings
instituted to condemn the property is, in
the vernacular of the law, an action in
eminent domain. The complaint sets forth j
that the land In question is needed for |
public use, for park uses, and a judgment
is asked condemning the property and
fixing the value of each individual hold
ing.
Over a hundred property holders are
made defendants in the action, and each i
of these must plead before the matter
can be finally adjudicated. It will take j
some time, but as the owners are well j
organized, looking forward to vacating |
the premises. it is safe to say that within
six months the land will be cleared of
buildings and the work of laying out the j
park commenced. No serious opposition
on the part of any of the owners has been
met with, and it is not likely that any
effort will be made to prolong the pro- !
ceedings. Owing to the law of the case, j
it would be a useless and expensive op
eration for any owner to attempt to stay \
the proceeding.
Credit for the stamping out of this
plague spot is due to Father Otis of St.
Mary's Church and the St. Marys Im
provement Association. By them the na
ture of the nuisance as it once existed
was placed before the Supervisors In its
right light, and in September last the
Supervisors voted to declare the lands in
question necessary for public uses. This
was done and an appropriation was made
to carry the matter out, the appropria
tion being augmented by funds raised by
Father Otis and the association. Now
that the matter has been carried to the
courts the end is near, as is also the end
of similar plague spots within the limits
of the city.
Second Class Cars Abolished.
The afternoon train of the Southern Pa
cific out of Ogden no longer accepts sec
ond class passengers. it is expected tint
the Rio Grande Western and the Union
Pacific will also adopt the same course
in regard to the Overland Limited.

will let him go."

and asked him as a favor not to render j
his decision till noon, as I was engaged j

peared before Groezinger yesterday to
answer charges of carrying a concealed

represented the defendant, and when
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter offered
the ordinance under which the arrest was
made as evidence Mack objected on the
ground that according to the Judge's
ruling In the track cases the ordi
nance was unconstitutional, and he de
sired to have all the rights of the defen
dant conserved.
The Judge turned red In the face and
lost his temper. He said brusquely, "Oh,

asking that his exception be noted.
Several witnesses were examined, and
the case was continued til! to-day.
THE BISCUIT COMBINE.
John G. Hanrahan Discusses Its
Many Advantages.
John G. Hanrahan of the brokerage and
banking firm of Dean & Shlbley, New
York City, is a guest at- the Palace. Mr.
Hanrahan represents th) Eastern under
writers who wrote the stocks and bonds
of the Pacific Coast Biscuit Company,
which will Include no less than seven
cracker companies.
He has devoted his best energies to
bring about this gigantic enterprise, and
now that his (forts have been crowned
with success he feels a sense of gratifi
cation at the outcome. in discussing th<**
subject iast evening Mr. Hanrahan said:
"There la no speculation about this new
organization. It is a purely business
proposition. It will be the policy of the
company to avoid any rise in prices. The
securities, some of which are now being
placed on the market at par, will be in
such shape that it will be unnecessary to
innate prices in order to bring about a
revenue. In fact, by combining expenses
will be considerably reduced. Advantage
will be taken of the cheapest market by
combined bases. a large export
trade will be built up which will materi
ally Increase the income of the plants
and a strong fight will be made to get
at least some of the foreign trade. One
great feature of th.- combination will be
an agreement with Eastern factories not
to come west of the Rockies with their
goods ana we will not trespass on the!*
territory.
"A fine chance is afforded to secure an
interest In a good profitable business on
the Pacific Coast. It Is the first property
on the coast offering securities In Call
fornia manufactures to the public We
have received the approval of Eastern
capitalists guaranteeing to carry out a
proposition in which the coast Is vitally
interested."

him personally responsible if its bills for

viding the aggregate amount of the bills
does not exceed $250,000. the amount of t he
appropriation made for this purpose. The
company's bills for March and April have
been held up by the Board of Supervi
sors. The notification is based on a fear
that the water fund will be exhausted
before these bills are ordered paid. The
Auditor has referred the matter to his
attorney as he does not propose to be held
sponsible for any of the acts of the
Board of Supervisors.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 13, 1899.
NEW DISCLOSURES OF
SECRET CONFERENCES
AT W. F. HERRIN'S HOME
Laumeister Promised His Vote to the Lawyer
and Was Assured Railroad Friendship, ,
The Southern Pacific Company Forces Its Serviceable Railroad
Commissioners Into the Open to Avoid the Danger of
Penalties Which May Aggregate Millions of
Dollars if the Suit Be Lost,
startling expose of the secret
conferences held among Railroad
Commissioners Blackstock and
conferences held among Railroad
Commissioners Blackstock and
Laumeister and William F. Her
rin created yesterday a sensation.
It seemed beyond belief that pub
lic officials, having in their care so
many vitally important interests of the
people of the State, would so openly
dishonor their positions, bring shame
upon themselves and lay bare, by an
indiscretion, the efforts of the Southern
Pacific Company to use public officers
as creatures of corruption. Astounding
as was the audacity of these Commis
sioners in making the home of Herrin
their rendezvous for discussions of pub
lic business, the whole story has not
been told.
Laumeister and Blackstock went to
the residence of the railroad lawyer not
only to discuss rates that would be fa
vorable to the Southern Pacific Com
pany and to drink Herrin's wine and
eat his food, but one of them at least
knowingly and willingly accepted the
dictation of the attorney to do what
the Southern Paciflc Company demand
ed. There has hardly been a more com
plete debasement of public honor in the
history of public men in California.
The story is Interesting.
Before the adoption of the first
Blackstock resolution, which rescind
ed the resolution of September, 1895,
Railroad Commissioners Laumeister
and Edson called upon M. M. Estee
to discuss with him railroad freights
and matters incidentally important to
the business of the board. At that
meeting the Blackstock resolution
was thoroughly discussed, and Com
missioner Laumeister declared that
he did not intend to vote for it. Lau
meister was thoroughly in earnest.
He said to Estee, with every show of
sincerity, that if he voted for the
Blackstock resolution he would be
ashamed to remain in the State. He
evidently understood then something
of the seriousness of such a vote.
After the conference with Estee Com
missioners Laumeister and Edson re
ceived a most unusual and startling in
vitation. It was to visit the home of
William F. Herrin. It is currently be
lieved, and until the revelations of yes
terday was believed with some reason,
that William F. Herrin does not tran
sact public business at his home. He
has an office, and a commodious one,
downtown. Commissioners Laumeister
SOUGHT TO END HER
LIFE IN THE WAVES
-â¦- r^ HRISTINE WENET, a -domestic 37 years old, tried to end her life yes
<|> I terday morning by walking into the surf out at the ocean beach, be
*+" j tween the Cliff House and the pier. A. A. Smith of 530 Eddy street and
â¦ *ââ¢< John Astley of San Jose, two youths who were wading within a dis
a tance of 100 feet from- the unfortunate woman, rushed to her rescue and
+ brought her in safety to the life saving station at the ocean beach. After
& providing the woman with warm, dry clothing, the authorities* at the sta-
T* ; tion sent her to the Golden Gate Receiving Hospital.
2 The attempted suicide refused at first to give her name and reason for
X her rash act. She finally admitted that she had grown tired of life and had
+ gone to the beach with the direct purpose of ending her. existence. Miss
<Â£> Wenet had made considerable preparation for the closing of her earthly
â¦ career and had arrayed herself In her very best clothesâ a silk gown and
X natty tan jacket When she had completely recovered from her ducking
T she declared she would not again attempt to rush into eternity.
X Miss Wenet, when out of employment, resides with her sister, Mrs. J.
T Guston at 25 Jansen street.

and Edson never had a reason to sus
pect that they were in the same social
set with Mr. Herrin, and they were
naturally inquisitive to know the
meaning of the invitation. But they
accepted it and went to the home of the
lawyer.
Herrin is something of an entertainer.
When the entertainment had pro
gressed to the stage generally known
as "Waiter, another bottle," Herrin re
vealed the secret of his invitation.
Herrin asked Commissioners Ed- |
son and Laumeister point blank to j
vote for the Blackstock resolution. !
The Southern Pacific lawyer was per- ;
suasive, insistent. "Of course," he :
said, "there will be a flurry in the
newspapers for a while, but it will i
soon blow over, and anyway, you
know where your friends are."
That is one way in which C. P. Hunt
ington has taken the Southern Pacific
Company out of politics. Commissioner
Edson refused to do as he was com
manded. Commissioner Laumeister
agreed and accepted with his agree
ment the brand of a discredited and
dishonored public official. Edson never
again accepted the hospitality of Mr.
Herrin's home. The subsequent con
ferences among Laumeister, Black
stock and Herrin have already been
related.
The reason which has made the
Southern Pacific Company force Lau
meister and Blackstock into the hu
miliation of public shame is a serious
one. In the "grain rate case" there are
many enormous interests to the rail
road involved. The question of costs
is a great one, as the Southern Pacific
Company does not care to pay anything
when it can avoid it. And there is the
problem of penalties,- If the resolution
of the Railroad Commissioners, adopted
in September, 1895, and fixing the grain
rate, be valid the Southern Pacific
Company will probably be forced to
pay enormous penalties for violating
the law. The question is a mooted one,
but the Southern Pacific Company is
fearful that a judgment would be
against it and it seeks to avoid the is
sue by making the Railroad Commis
sioners obey its commands.
The State constitution provides enor
mous penalties for a violation of any
resolution adopted by the Railroad
Commissioners. Every violation sub
jects the offending corporation to a fine
not exceeding $20,000, and every officer,
agent and employe to a fine not exceed
ing $5000 or imprisonment In a county
jail not exceeding one year. As the
grain rate resolution was adopted in
September, 1895, and the Southern Pa
cific Company has been violating it
hundreds of times every day some no
tion of the penalties which might be
exacted may be gained. The sum
might aggregate into millions of dol
lars. That is why the Southern Pa
cific Company wants the Railroad
Commissioners to ask the dismissal of
the celebrated suit.
FORD HAS NO POLICY.
Attorney General Says the
Commissioners Dictate His
Action.
SACRAMENTO, May 10.â Attorney
General Ford, was asked by The Call
correspondent to-night if he intended
to obey the instructions of the Railroad
Commissioners and ask Judge Morrow
to dismiss the grain-rate cases. He
was asked, also, if, as Attorney Gen
eral of the State, and hence attorney
for the respondents in the case, he will
not also be attorney for the plaintiff,
the Southern Pacific Company, if he
makes the request demanded by the
Railroad Commissioners.
In reply, Attorney General Ford gave
the following statement, adding that it
was all that he desired to say upon the
subject at this time:
"I have not as yet received any offi
cial notice of the action of. the board
to which you refer, and I am not cer
tain, therefore, as to the precise na
ture of its directions, except such as I
have gained knowledge of through to
day's papers. I can only say generally
that the Board of Railroad Commis
sioners and not the Attorney General
must determine, the policy to be pur
sued with reference to the so-called
grain-rate case. I shall do nothing in
the matter until my return to San
Francisco and am officially advised as
to the instructions that have been
given me by the board.
" Whatever I may do in the matter
will, of course, be done for the board,
and as Its attorney, and because of in
structions from it. The constitution
and the law have clothed the Board of
Railroad Commissioners with certain
powers and, make it the duty of the At
torney General to render such legal
services as the board may require of
him. The performance of this duty will
be the measure of my act in the prem
ises."
EDSON IS AT STOCKTON.
Confers With Citizens on the
Railroad's Unjust Dis
crimination.
STOCKTON, May 10.â Railroad Com
missioner Edson spent the day here
gathering information concerning the
operations of the Southern Pacific grain
schedule against this city. He met
with several prominent citizens, and at
the conference they laid before him
facts and figures showing the unjust
discrimination against Stockton. When
seen after the conference the Commis
sioner said:
"I am informing myself. This is too
fine a country to be discriminated
against."
"Do you think the other Commis
sioners will act as fairly?"
"Well, I cannot speak for the other
members," replied the Commissioner.
NEWS AND GOSSIP
OF LOCAL THEATRICALS
The theaters offer nothing of a serious
nature, this week, but quite an assortment
of more or less comic attractions. At the
Columbia Mr. Prohman's production of
"On and Off" is remarkable for an ex
cellent company and a smooth, well bal
anced performance. The farce itself will
not set the bay a-burning, but played as
it is by this polished company it is a
more than acceptable bill.
At the Alcazar It is the piece rather
than the acting that attracts attention.
Not that "His Japanese Wife" is a flrst
rate farce in its present shape, but in
spite of some crudities and convention
alities It presents several original and
amusing ideas. The immorality of Mr.
Greene's new work need not be insisted
upon, even for the purpose of advertising.

TO MAKE WAR
ON THE EVILS
OF CHINATOWN
Mayor Phelan Called Upon
To Take Action.
A New Vigilance Committee Pro
posed to Eradicate the
Dens of Vice.
THE highbinder must go. The edict '
has been issued and the plan of at
tack formed. Mayor Phelan has â â 
been called upon already to make
the initial move, and the moment
he gives assent the human tigers
of Chinatown will be compelled to scatter
to the four winds.
The method of.attack is based upon an
intimate knowledge of things as they
exist in Chinatown. Workers in the mis
sions and humane societies assert that the
highbinder could not exist in San Fran
cisco were it not for the countless houses
of Chinese prostitution. The yellow des
peradoes prey upon their inmates for
food, money and shelter between whiles
when they are not murdering their fel
lows. This fact has led those who are In
terested in the scattering of the high
binder to believe that the most effective
way to reach that end is to cut off his
base of supplies. Acting on that theory,
a number of well-known local workers
for morality will meet this afternoon at
room 17 in the Sherman block, Clay and
Montgomery streets, and form a commit
tee for the purification of many things in
the city, one means to that end being the
suppression of the dens of prostitution
in Chinatown and the clearing out of the
murderous tong men. In line with the
work of these people, M. M. Foote, an
attorney who has clients in Chinatown
who have suffered at the hands of high
binders, has already addressed a letter
to the Mayor. It reads as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO. May 8, 1899.
To the Hon. James D. Phelan, Mayor of
the City and County of San Francisco, .
State of Californiaâ Dear Sir: Experience
has shown that Chinese "houses of ill
fame" are not only nuisances in them- .
selves but are the main support of high
binders and other law-breakers. That
when these resorts are suppressed murder
and lawlessness ceases In Chinatown; that
the lawless if deprived (by the closing of
these resorts) of their sources of revenue
from the blackmailing of the inmates of
these dens soon disperse and relieve the
city and county of their presence; that
these bouse, are not only nuisances but
prisons filled with slaves held as chattels
for sale as well as hire. And all of this in
a free land. ' -ly'
Therefore. I attract your attention to
these facts as well as to the fact that sec
tion 4 of an act for the suppression of Chi- .
nese houses of ill fame, approved March 31,
1866. makes it your duty to suppress these*
houses.
Believing that this matter has not been
brought properly to your attention hereto
fore, we now await your action. Very re
spectfully, M. M. FOOTE.
No reply to this letter has reached Mr.
Foote, probably for the simple reason that
Mayor Phelan has hardly had time to

reply. Mr. Foote hopes to have it. how

The Rival Goes Out â Harbor
Commissioners Decide on a Num

The steamer Roanoke is not going back
to Manila. Her owners want her for the
Klondike trade, and she will leave here
for Seattle about the 25th inst. On her
arrival at the Sound she will be fitted out
and will go into commission about June 10.
The Hawaiian hark Roderick Dhu sailed
for Hilo yesterday. She took away a
large number of passengers and a full
cargo. On deck she carried about fifty
mules* for the plantations. Captain John
son expects to make the run to the islands
in about ten days.
There is still no sign of the broken
down steamer Elihu Thomson, and the
chances now seem to be that she has been
driven off shore. Captains of incoming .
vessels report heavy westerly weather,
and Captain Whitney and his vessel must
have been ln it. The insurance companies
who have risks on the hull and cargo of
the Thomson sent the steamer Rival out
again yesterday. Captain Perriman, the j
marine surveyor, went out on the steamer
and he will keep her out until the Thom
son is found or there is no hope of
success. The tug Relief is still out. and
she may come along at any time towing
the missing vessel. One thing is certain-
Captain Randall will not come back until
he has found her or his coal gives out.
The Harbor Commissioners have held
a secret session to decide upon the suc
cessors of the wharfingers and collectors
whose terms have either expired or are
about to expire. The fortunate ones will
not be known until next Tuesday. Com

refers to contains the following provision
concerning the method for suppression of
these hotbeds of highbinder*. :
Sec. 4. Besides the remedies now provided
by law tor the abatement of public
nuisance it shall be lawful for any Sheriff,
Constable, Justice of the Peace or other
public officer, and it shall be the duty of
the Minor, or other presiding officer, and
the chief or head of the police force of
every town and city, and the duty of the
Supervisor of every township or district in
which any such house of ill fame shall ex
ist as aforesaid, and each and every one of
them, severally, to cause notice In writing
to be given to all persons who may be
owners, lessees, tenants or occupants of
any such house of ill fame or of the land
whereon the same is situated, and to all
persons who may keep, manage, . control, *
inhabit or use such house, peremptorily re
quiring the abatement of such nuisance
within three days after the service ,i such
notice, and such notice may also be posted
upon the outside of the outer door or other
conspicuous place upon such house of ill
fame. In towns and cities the notice may
be in such form as the Mayor or other pre
siding officer, or the chief or head of the
police force may prescribe, and when serv
ed an affidavit showing the time, place
and manner of service shall be indorsed
upon a duplicate thereof, which shall be
returned and filed in the office of the chief
or head of the police force if there be such
an officer, and If not, then in the offlce of
the Mayor or other presiding officer of such
city or town.
To make the t.tsk even a simpler one,
the Legislature in 187*1 passed an amend
ment to the act of 1886 providing for con
victions on evidence as to the common
repute of such houses. Under it it will
not be difficult for those interested in the
eradication from Chinatown of the twin
evilsâ prostitution and highbindersâ to ac
complish their work. The task will be
easy if the assistance of the Mayor and
the Chiet of Police, which they have
every reason to expect, is lent them.
They propose to go to the Mayor and the
Chief of Police and say to them: "Gen
tlemen, there are such and such houses
of prostitution in Chinatown. They are
in Bartlett alley and Sullivan alley and
Ross alley, on Dupont street, on Jackson
and on other streets and alleys. We have
witnesses to prove their common repute.
Order your policemen to force the doors
and arrest the inmates and we will fur
nish the witnesses who will prove their
immorality."
What answer the Mayor and the Chief
of Police or either of them will make to
this plain statement remains to be seen.
Should they answer in the affirmative and
say, "We will do as you ask," the organ
izers of the new purification committee,
under whatever name they may act, wilt
do as they have promised, If the author
ities called upon do not respond, the per
sons who have made the call will act
upon their own responsibility, backed to
some extent by funds from the law abid
ing element in Chinatown, and will whack
at white landlords and yellow tenants
until the bitter end. They are of the
opinion that the victory is to be had with
some little exertion in the right direction
and they all say that they are prepared
to go as far in that direction as the law
allows.

name was passed. "Well, I think we can

Mr. Herold. What do you say?" again
asked Mr. Kilburn. "Drop himâ him
by all means if you want to," said Mr.
Herold, with a smile. "I appointed him
to oblige George Knight." And so It went
on for ten minutes before Commissioner
Kilburn was able to find places for the
two sweepers. ,Â» -

BALDWIN'S IMPUDENCE.
AFTER having left his ruined building an eye
s â¢â¢<? to the city for months, after having de
la*. â¢*'! in removing the obstructing fence from
the sidewalk until forbearance ceased to be a virtue
and the Supervisors ordered it to be taken down,
E. J. Baldwin, the lucky, has had the impudence to
go into the courts and ask for an injunction restrain
ing the board from enforcing the order.
In almost any other city in the world the nuisance
which Baldwin has maintained on the corner of
Powell and Market streets would have been abated
long ago. Here the public sympathized with him in
the loss occasioned by the destruction of his prop
erty and bore with him in patience while he post
, . .-r i i.-l .1
poned and put off the work of clearing away the
debris and restoring the sidewalk to its proper pur
pose ol serving the public as a lootway up and down
... '. - .- - . â â *. * â 
the >treet.
Merchants having shops adjoining the fenced-in
portion of the walk have suffered a loss of trade by
reason of this wholly unnecessary delay in clearing the
street, and now, when it last the Supervisors have
taken action to clear the walk, Mr. Baldwin fights for
more delay.
There is not a single valid reason why an injunc
tion should issue in this case. Baldwin has had more
titan ample time to put his property in condition. An
injuncti would simply enable him to block the
street indefinitely. It is time the fence was removed
and the use of the walk restored to the people so that
business along that block of Market street shall be no
longer impeded.
THE STUBBORN MR. STONE.
WILLIAM /. STOKE, who has two claims to
public attention, inasmuch as he was once
Governor of Missouri and is now the close,
confidential friend of William J. Bryan, is living up
tc his name, showing himself to have a stony heart
toward all gold Democrats and threatening to prove
a rocky barrier to their return to the Democratic
camp.
He is now in New York, and when asked in the
course of an interview the other day whether he would
vote to admit gold Democrats to the next Democratic
National Convention, he replied*. "Most certainly I
would not. Nobody else would who is a genuine
Democrat. That is the feeling in the West and
the South. Why should anybody who stood by the
party regard as Democrats those who turned against
it: They are not Democrat-". They will not be let
into the next convention."
The distinguished Mr. Stone has of course a right
to speak for himself, and possibly a right to speak for
his close friend, Mr. Bryan. He has claimed too
much, however, in asserting that the West and the
South share his opinion. The press of both of those
sections has been notably united in declaring that
some other issue than that of free silver must be
taken up in 1900. The Salt Lake Tribune, for ex
ample, a strong exponent of the silver industries of
Utah, recently said:
_ . , * â¢ -. â¢ -,* â * Â«-â¢ -â 'â 'â 
"Our judgment is that it is useless to make another
stand for silver in this country until conditions
change. We have drawn an undue proportion of the
world's wealth to this country during the last two
years, with the result that there is not a country' in
Europe that is not distressed now for money and in
serious trouble, and our idea is that as things are
tending at present the rcmonetization of silver will
have to come from the nations of Europe."
The Tribune further declares the silver Republi
cans of the Mountain States will not support the
Democratic party in 1900. That opinion we believe
to be well founded. Mr. Stone, therefore, is likely to
find himself treated as a stumbling block and a cause
of offense at the next Democratic convention. If he
attempts to hold the fort for Bryan and free silver or
any other issue of discontent in 1900 he will be pushed
aside by the rising common sense of his party.
Democrats are not all fools, and a considerable num
ber of them have shown their determination not to
repeat the slaughter-house march of 1896 under a
discredited leader and for a forlorn hope. '
Genera! Merriam. in his campaign against the
miners, has decided to place a censorship upon the
press. It might not be amiss to suggest that he could
with some judgment place one on his own tongue as
well.

THE MILK IN THE COCOANUT.
WHEN the application of Attorney General
Ford to dismiss the case of the railroad
i against the Railroad Commissioners was made
the other day in the Circuit Court of the United
States and Judge Morrow had refused to entertain
the motion because it was presented on behalf of the
respondents in the suit and was based upon false state-
I ment- in the resolutions adopted by the Railroad
Commission, under which the Attorney General was
compelled to act, it is reported that Judge Morrow
pointedly addressed himself to E. S. Pillsbury, who
! represented the Southern Pacific Company, and
asked, "Why don't you dismiss the case?" and that
j Mr. Pillsbury replied. "Well, we don't know to what
penalties that might subject us." â¢
This brief sentence lets the milk out of the cocoa
nut. In order that the public may fully comprehend
the significance of the admission and be enabled in
telligently to determine why Mr. Huntington played
the game of pretended withdrawal from politics so
low down while the canvass of last year was proceed
ing, in order, among other things, to secure control
of the Railroad Commission, a clear apprehension of
the facts is essential.
In 1895 the Railroad Commissioners adopted a
resolution for a horizontal reduction of freights to
the extent of 25 per cent. This resolution, con
demned by their special counsel, Robert Y. Hayne
and W. W. Foote, and also, we believe, by Judge
Fitzgerald, the Attorney General, was never followed
I up by a schedule and therefore never carried into
! effect. But the Commissioners also, on September 14
and 15, 1895, resolved to lower grain rates by 8 per
cent, and this conclusion was regularly scheduled and
became operative. Then the suit in the Circuit Court,
over which Judge McKenna at that time presided, was
brought and a sweeping injunction obtained, after
; ward modified so that it applied exclusively to the
I schedule of grain rates, and in all other respects was
dissolved.
The narrowness of the injunction as ultimately
framed disposed of the false pretense that it was neces
sary to rescind the 8 per cent reduction and to have
the suit dismissed in order to enable the Commission
ers to proceed with a systematic readjustment of the
I railroad tariff. They were in no way hindered in
j whatever action they might have seen fit to take with
j respect to other commodities, and, as to grain .itself,
j they might have made any substantial modification of
1 their schedule of 1895 without incurring the penalties
of contempt.
The present board, therefore, or rather Messrs.
I Blackstock and Laumeister, the majority of the pres
| ent board, acting in antagonism to Commissioner Ed
son, repealed the resolution of 1895 and instructed
j Attorney General Ford to move for the dismissal of
| the suit, without any assignable justification or palli
i ation and only in the railroad interest. And they
j overruled Mr. Edson not only under these condi
tions, but in the face of the advice of their special
counsel, solicited by themselves. There are many
reasons why the litigation should be pressed to a con
clusion. The railroad appealed to a court of equity, 1
and. by the scope ot its bill of complaint, put great
fundament questions in issue far transcending in
importance the validity of the grain rates, and in
volving the power of the State, through it*- Railroad
Commissioners, over the whole subject of freights
and fares. One of these questions is the right of the
owners of a railroad system, operated within a State,
by the mere subterfuge of transferring their property
to a corporation organized elsewhere, to escape from
reasonable local supervision. In other words, it is
practically important and also possible in this iitiga
j tion to ascertain whether the Central Pacific Railroad
Company and the entire congeries of corporations in
California bearing the Huntington brand can mas
querade under the disguise of the Southern Pacific
Company of Kentucky. Another material point is to
find out whether in fixing the basis upon which rates
are to be adjusted, so as to insure a fair interest upon
the values of railroad property, fictitious or exagger
ated indebtedness is to be computed. The railroad
claimed, both in its bill of complaint and in the pre
sentation of its case by counsel, that the rates estab
lished by itself were just and even excluded legitimate
profit, and therefore, that, apart from other legal
obstacles, there was nothing upon which the judg
ment of the commission could act.
The railroad selected its own forum and made its
own case. It ought not to be permitted to recede
from the position it deliberately assumed. It has
j not dared to ask straightforwardly for the dismissal
! of its suit, but has depended upon the friendship of the
! Commissioners, to whom its political support was
j surreptitiously extended. In American history no
! more damnable outrage, no more brutal infraction
!of the elementary principle of equality before the
law, has been designed than the effort of the railroad
emperor to run both sides of a litigation in which he
is vitally interested. Railroad Commissioners who
I would allow themselves to be used in this infamous
manner should be excoriated from one end of the
Union to the other.
The most cogent reason for the refusal of Judge
I Morrow's invitation by Mr. Pillsbury was hinted in his
: quoted reply and remains to be explicitly' stated. If
! the grain schedule of 1895 be valid the railroad, its
I officers and its employes, have incurred penalties
i which i'" they could be enforced would probably
1 amount in money to more than the value of the whole !
i railroad property, and would subject numerous promi-
I nent individuals to imprisonment in the County Jail I
j for life. Article 3. section 22, of the State constitu
tion of 1879 contains the following self-executing pro
j vision:
"Any railroad corporation or transportation com
! pany which shall fail or refuse to conform to such
' rates as shall be established by such Commissioners,
j or shall charge rates in excess thereof, or shall fail
j to keep their accounts in accordance with the system
prescribed by the commission, shall be fined not ex-
I ceeding twenty thousand dollars for each offense, and
! every officer, agent or employe of any such corporation
I or company who shall demand or receive rates in excess
I thereof, or who shall in any manner violate the pro
visions of this section, shall be fined not exceeding
five thousand dollars or be imprisoned in the County
j Jail not exceeding one year."
The transportation of grain by the railroad in flat vi
j olation of the 8 per cent schedule has lasted for three
j years and a half and has probably embraced hundreds
of distinct shipments in a single day. If that rate
I should be legally sustained, and the fundamental law
J applied to Mr. Huntington as it would be to John
j Smith, he. might find his resources for the payment
j of the debt to the Government suddenly collapsed.
Of course it is widely considered, even by the
special counsel to whom we have alluded, whose ca
pacity and whose honor will not be questioned, that
the repeal of the resolution of 1895, to which those
gentlemen strenuously objected, has already wiped
j out the accumulated penalties, and that it is doubtful
I whether they could be restored if the repeal itself
j should be rescinded. Upon this point there is some
contrariety of opinion among atfle lawyers. But evi
dently it was in Mr. Pillsbury's mind when he re
! sponded to Judge Morrow's question. And the fact
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAT 11, 1899.
of the repeal, by the votes of Messrs. Laumeister and
Blackstock, sheds additional and baneful light upon
Mr. Huntington's political interference, falsely dis
claimed; with the election of Railroad Commissioners.
On Monday last the railroad game was blocked.
The next day the two recreant Commissioners tried
to modify their resolutions of instructions to Attorney
General Ford so as to eliminate the false aspersions
exposed by Judge Morrow. It remains to be seen
whether their revised betrayal of the public interests
will be successful and whether the railroad can dis
: miss its own suit on the application of its nominal an

THE MOVEMENT ON MILES.
IT is with little satisfaction that the American peo
ple read of the movement. to expel General Miles
from command and drive him from the army. The
| testimony taken by the commission to inquire into
the condition of the beef supply was published to an
extent sufficient to prevent the least feeling of popu
lar respect for the report of the commission. That
report reads like a conclusion reached before testi
mony was heard, that is adhered to though discred
ited by the evidence.
War, even when carried on by nations most ex
j perienced in its emergencies by constant operations
j in the field, is always an opportunity for the unscru
pulous to get unjust gain by the manipulation of
contracts and supplies. In the very best conditions
Government never gets the same value received as an
individual. It is estimated, with approximate correct
ness, that everything used by the Government in war
i costs about double what it would cost an individual.
If this state of things is avoidable it is seldom
avoided. When to this chronic waste of war is added
such a condition of the army ration as to make it
not only non-nutritious but noxious and dangerous
j to the health of the troops, a frightful situation is dis
: closed. That this was the condition of the beef sup
ply is settled beyond question. It was its condition
in the camps as well as in the field and on the trans
ports. The testimony to establish this cannot be con
cealed under the inspired findings of the commission.
The evidence of Governor Roosevelt and men of
equal eminence and credence is accepted by the po
: pie, though it made no impression upon the commis
sion.
The beef interests, which fattened on the treasury
while the sons of the people were dying of the food
they supplied, are reported to demand the degrada
tion of General Miles because foreign countries, cus
tomers for our beef products, are showing a prudent
desire to protect their people against the ills that
were visited upon our own troops. They accuse
General Mile-- of discrediting American meat products
all over the world! If he told the truth about the
army beef, and if Roosevelt and the cloud of witnesses
who supported his charges tell the truth, as they do
and as the people believe they do, the American meat
supply is discredited by the criminal greed of the great
monopolies which control its conversion into forms
for consumption by the world's market.
From another quarter comes support of General
Miles' charges. A committee of the United States
Senate is investigating the adulteration of foods. The
testimony taken by this committee since the beef
commission filed its ridiculous report is a complete
revelation of the very processes the results of which
were stated in the testimony of Roosevelt and the
â  charges of Miles.
That committee finds that ''freezine," "preserva
-1 tine," "rosaline" and "laktone" are in common use by
the handlers of meat. Professor Mitchell, analytical
chemist of the Wisconsin Dairy and Food Commis
sion, informed the committee that these substances
are used in dairy -products, meats, bulk oysters, fish,
hams and corned beef. "Freezine" is nothing but
pure formic aldehyde, a chemical that destroys the
tissues of the stomach. Of all these chemical agents
Professor Mitchell says that they arrest fermentation
and decay only by destroying the digestible character
of the food on which they are used.
Dr. Wiley, the Government expert, examined a sub
stance used to preserve an appearance of freshness in
meats and found it identical with the poisonous pickle
used in medical college- to preserve cadavers for use
on the dissecting table.
Here, then, we have in progress an entirely inde
pendent inquiry into the same subject, ordered by the
United States Senate, which reveals the very condition
that formed the substance of General Miles' charges.
What have the poisoners of our soldiers to say to
this? The Senate committee is not inventing any
thing to discredit the American meat supply. It is
simply divulging facts for which the meat-poisoning
| enemies of General Miles are responsible. They are
| guilty of commercial dishonor, and if the hog and
i cattle raisers suffer by a decline in price due to a fall-
I ing off in the foreign demand, the fault is not on Gen
eral Miles but on the beef contractors who are try
ing to pull him down.
This country produces the largest quantity of
wholesome beef and pork of any country in the world.
Our wide pastures and ranges, the abundance of our
corn crop, on which both hogs and cattle depend;
j the freedom of our herds from the epizootics which
| afflict animals elsewhere and render their flesh unfit
for food, all join to make us the world's resource for
â  meat products prepared for human food. If the men
who buy this wholesome meat and through greed
: process it so that it destroys instead of supporting life
have by these courses injured the credit of American
meat they cannot hide themselves nor dodge respon
sibility behind the demanded degradation of General
Miles.
The United States Government has finished once
and for all with canned beef. Reputations have been
lost, American lives have been sacrificed, the nations
have enjoyed a tragic farce and the United States
Government has finished with embalmed beef. Per
haps the people of the United States would like to be
finished with it also.
Another great modern reform has been struck a
body blow. Miss Marguerite Lindley, the redoubt
able enemy of kissing, blushingly refuses to deny that
she has ever been kissed. Nobody seems to have
offered to test her to a definite answer to the charge.
There is a growing sentiment in New York that
United States Senators should be elected by popular
vote. If New York were afflicted with a Gage and the
political nightmare of a- Burns the sentiment would
crystallize very rapidly into a demand.
A defaulting ex-Tax Collector of San Luis Obispo
County has been found in hiding in a small suburb
of the Peruvian city of Lima. The hiding-places for
absconding malefactors are becoming fewer in the
world.
The dispatches announce that the young women
students of the Nebraska State University gave a drill

costume like that would make the checks of a Filipino

LETTERS PROM THE PEOPLE.
FLAX GROWN AT TOMALES.
Editor Callâ l have read with much interest the articles which have recently
appeared in The Call on the subject of flax culture in California, and as probably
there are many agriculturists in this State who will question the practicability
of growing this fiber, I write to acquaint them through your columns with the re
sult of a trial made here in Tomales thirty years ago.
In 1569 the late John Keys planted on his farm in Tomales twenty-five acres
in flax. The crop was a success; it averaged three feet in height and
the yield was heavy, but owing to the lack of a market it was not
planted a second time. Mr. Keys brought skilled fiaxworkers from Ire
land to handle the crop and had scutching machines erected and in op
eration on his land. A sample of the fiber was sent to Belfast. Ireland, and it
was pronounced by the experts there equal to flax there grown. Other portions
of the flax wore sent to a rope manufacturer in Oakland and there made into
rope, but this was found not to pay. The soil in this part of the State is espe
cially adapted for the growth of flax, and if through the efforts of The Call a
market can be found it is only a question of a short time when California will
number flax as one of her most valuable products. Commending The Call and
its proprietor for their efforts on behalf of the Californian farmer I remain, very
truly yours, -Â*Â« ~ JAMES W. KEYS. .
Tomales, May 4, 1599.
A PANHANDLE TO THE CITY HALL.
To the Editor of The Call: As a citizen and taxpayer of this city I desire to
make a suggestion in relation to the panhandle extension.
My suggestion is that in place of continuing it straight down to Van Ness
â avenue it be made to diverge westerly at Baker street to Grove and then con
tinue down either between drove and Have? streets or between Grove and Fulton
streets, so as to take, in Alamo square (thereby saving two blocks), and let it
terminate at the City Hall or at Market street, corner of Haves.

The real estate market continues firm,
although the number of sales reported
during the past week or ten days is not

for property ,in the wholesale district,
which caused quite a flurry about a

valuable pieces of improved real estate,
which has of course put a partial stop to
purchases temporarily.* Nevertheless
money is abundant and investors are on
the lookout for desirable offerings. In the
residence districts the demand continues
active and a number of transactions are
reported. There is also a marked activity
in building circles, contracts aggregating
$70,000 having been signed during the past

DON'T LIKE THE ECONOMY.
Suggestion That Pile-Driving Should
Be Done by Contract.
At the meeting of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners Tuesday Presi
dent Kilburn surprised his associates by
introducing a proposition to have the
work of piledriving done by contract. The
present system of using the State's pile
driver and paying men daily or monthly
wages to drive piles where needed ie
thought by the president of the board to
be more expensive than the contract plan.
Commissioner Harney was not in favor
of taking the work away from the men
now earning wages and giving it to con
tractors. He doubted whether the change
would be in the line of economy. He was
sure, however, that it would cause the
dismissal of many men who are now earn
ing a livelihood for their families. He
cited the fact that the dredger and pile
driver were purchased to protect the
board from the exactions of the contract
system. Mr. Kilburn's proposition did
not meet with a second.

STORY OF MAD INFATUATION
â â¢ â
BROUGHT TO LIGHT THROUGH A
CROSS-COMPLAINT.
âa
William D. Pollock Compromised
Matters With the Lady and
Thereby Gained Title to
His Property.
a
An answer and cross-complaint filed
yesterday to the complaint of the execu
trices of the estate of the late Joseph M.
Wood against Mr. and Mrs. William D.
Pollock, to quiet title to valuable real es
tate, bring to light a heretofore unknown
chapter of dramatic interest in the life
of the dead capitalist. In the answer
the defendants simply deny they unlaw
fully withhold possession of the lands in
question, and deny the right of the plain
tiffs to possession thereto.
Following the formal denials to the al
legations of complaints. Mr. and Mrs.
Pollock make cross-complaint of unusual
nature, this cross-complaint setting forth
their alleged right to the property and
the manner in which it came Into their
possession.
William D. Pollock, the cross-complain
ant, was, during the life of Joseph M:
Wood, a warm personal friend of the de
ceased, it is set forth. Many months prior
to Wood's death, the cross-complaint con
tinues, he was harassed and continually
annoyed by a Miss Clarisa Holmes, who
manifested a mad infatuation for the
dead capitalist. In her "mad Infatua
tion," which received but little encour
agement from Mr. Wood, Miss Holmes, In
despair at the manner of her treatment
at the bands of her idea!, often threat
ened his life. At other times she would
threaten to brinK suit against him for
the recovery of certain unspecified de
mands she claimed she was entitled to
and also threatened to make a sensa
tional exposure of the life and character
of the deceased. These means failing,
She "resorted to threats of various kinds
for the purpose of extorting money from
and blackmailing the deceased."
In fear of great bodily harm and in
jury at the hands of Clarisa Holmes, and
suffering great mental anguish, Wood, it
is alleged, engaged the services of Mr.
Pollock to act as his agent for the pur
pose of inducing and persuading MiSS
Holmes to refrain from carrying her
threats Into execution and to conciliate
and treat with Miss Holmes for the re
lease of all demands she claimed to right
fully -hold against the deceased. For his
services, it is claimed, Mr. Wood agreed
to give Pollock the property in dispute.
Pollock avers that he immediately en
tered upon his duties, and for nine months
labored upon the obstinacy of Miss
Holmes, but finally a compromise was
effected and he made a settlement with
her in behalf of Mr. Wood of all her
claims, and henceforth she worried Wood
no more.
In appreciation of the good work done
and true to his agreement. Wood placed
his benefactor in possession of the dis
puted premises; but his death occurred
before he made a deed, as agreed upon.
Hence the cross-complaints pray mat the
plaintiffs, by virtue of the authority of
their office, be compelled to legally convey
the property to them and leave them for
ever in peaceful possession.

strangers should not occasion surprise if
the gentleman is known to the recipient
of the invitation. Each person living at
a distal receiving an invitation incloses
his or her card and sends it by mail. If a
family of half a dozen receive separatei
invitations each should inclose a card _l
the bride's parents if it is a case of tiros
family being acquainted only with the
groom. The parents having sent out the
invitations will certainly recognize the
cards, and the postmark on the envelope
will designate where they come from. It
would be in order for the head of the fam
ily on behalf of the family to acknowledge
the receipt of invitations to the "at

press regrets that distance prevents at
tendance, and send the same to the groom.

OF "MAMMY"
WAS A RUSE
Such Is the Theory of
Young Bell.
â â
DONE TO MISLEAD CREDITORS
â â
AGED COLORED WOMAN IS NOW
BETWEEN TWO EIRES.
â¦-
testimony of a Deputy Sheriff Is
Given That She Swore to the
Ownership of the Sonoma
wnership of the Sonoma
Ranch.
The mystery of the "house of mys
tery"âthe eviction of its ebony-hued
guardian; "Mammy" Pleasantâ it is
claimed hy the creditors of the nged col;
ored woman and by young Fred Beli; was
a ruse, having ns its object the evasion
<*f all obligations of the principals in the
strange after-dark ouster. That the evic
tion of "Mammy" was simply a little
strategy to mislead ihis army of creditors
is generally accepted, ar.d each succeed
ing day of the proceedings to declare
"Mammy" insolvent results in the un
â folding of a fact or action lending
"strength to the theory.
Mrs. Bell, who would have the world
believe her to be "Mammy's" enemy, sits
[beside the deposed queen of the "house '
â¢of mystery" during tbe proceedings. As
of old. "Mammy. and Mrs. Bell exchange
their views In whispers; and on their
"faces ro trice of enmity is manifested.
Hoth regard the counsel of the same law
yer, R. M. F. Soto, and it is only when an
Adjournment cornea that they separate.
The friendship existing between these
â¢people since the "eviction" of Mammy"
js a matter of comment, as people cannot
understand; but young Fred Bell has an
explanation that is not implausible He
gays that the "eviction" â .*... made for the
purpose of placing Mammy" without th-"*
Jimrts of the "house of mystery,'.! so in
event in the present insolvency' proceed
i: ga none of "Mammy's" property can be
located the creditors cannot claim that
the debts were incurred in behalf of Mrs.
Hell and commence proceedings against
her. All of the debts were incurred by
.Mrs. Pleasant, but it is broadly hinted
that the old colored woman simply acted
as the agent of Mrs. Bell. Then, again,
young Bell says if an effort is made to
hold Mrs. Bell for the debts and it is
demonstrated that they were incurred at
her instance and any paper exists show
ing that such was the case. Mrs. Bell will
plead that she was under "Mammy's" in
fluence and was powerless to prevent the
expenditure. For these reasons an "evic
tion" was determined upon, that thi com
munity might believe the principals were
henceforth enemies, but i?i truth it was a
ruse for mutual beneflt and to make the
creditors' efforts to collect the more diffi-
CUIL
When the case was called yesterday
morning "Mammy" was placed 'upon the
stand, and in half an hour was between
two llres of extremely unpleasant heat.
"Mammy" must either swear that she is
the owner of the Sonoma County ranch
to which Mrs. Bell testified she had a
deed or face a charge of perjury.
Â£>eptuy Pherift" Simon wbb called, and tes
tified that "Mammy" qualified upon a
bond to release an attachment upon a
pif-ee of property belonging to Mrs. Bell
in September of l^l'S. and at that time she
swore that she owned the Sonoma County
ranch; which is valued at $100,009. Mrs.
Hell testified that the ranch was deeded
to hÂ«r In 1595 by "Mammy," and this
places the aged defendant In an awkward
predicament. How she will get out of the
hole; escape her creditors and also a
charge of perjury remains to be seen.
In her answer to the present suit
"Mammy" denied that she owed a dollar
on earth, but yesterday, after vigorous
questioning, she was forced to admit
claims aggregating some $30,000. This
made the creditors jubilant and "Mum

With a gaping wound in his throat and

reason is denied him.
Last Monday morning Paulson, while

were temporarily treated. Several hours

After being thrown in a cold, damp ceil
Paulson proceeded t.i destroy the furni

found necessary to strap him down,
During the night he managed to free
himself from the straps that held him a
prisoner and vigorously endeavored to
batter down the door of his ceil. Thinking
he might reopen the wound in hie throat
two of the attaches of the detent! in ward

DECLARES MOODY
IS ILLOGICAL
r\e\f. Dr. SunderlaQd Maizes a
Reply to Rev. Dr.
Coyle.
OAKLAND, May 10.â Rev. J. S. Sunderland, pastor of the First Unitarian
Church, does not approve of some of the statements of Rev. Dr. Coyle, pub
lished last Monday. The remarks of Dr. Coyle were evoked by an address
of Dr. Everett Hale that Presbyterianism is a menace to true Americanism
and good citizenship.
"In The Call of Monday Rev. Dr. Coyle of this city represents me as Bay
ing that he and tin- other orthodox ministers of Oakland 'do not believe what
they preach,' at which he is very naturally offended," says Dr. Sunderland.
"I am. happy to be able to correct the Impression which be has received, I
have never mad, any statement of this kind. I have simply said that some of
them do not believe all that Mr. Moody preachesâ a very different thing.
Perhaps I may be permitted to quote my exact words: 'Preachers bring Mr.
Mood} Into their pulpits to defend doctrines which their Intelligence does not
allow them to defend. But his defense reassures the people, makes the theo
logical basis upon which their churches stand seem strong, and so they
quiet their consciences by hoping that some good is done. How many of the
preachers of Oakland who have united In bringing him here accept the doc
trine of "Salvation by the blood" in the literalistic and ghastly form in which
he puts it? How many would risk their reputation as thinkers and scholars
by opposing the higher criticism of the Bible as he opposes It, or by defending
the stories of Jonah and Lid's wife as historic, as he defends them? How
" many could be induced to Imperil their standing as intelligent men by declar
ing, as Mr. Moody declares In the stoutest manner, that if the Bible contain a
single error It Is all worthless and must all be thrown away? Why do minis
ters who know better than to say these things bring him into their pulpits to
say them? Mr. Moody, has strong and noble sides; but this is his weak side,
as It is plainly the weak side of the preachers who give him public indorse
ment N and put him forward as their representative. Of course these preachers
have a better side than this.'
"From this quotation it will be seen that Instead of charging Dr. Coyle and
others with preaching what they do not believe I have only pointed out
that they do not believe certain crude and unreasonable doctrines preached
, by Mr. Moody. That I am right in this I presume will not be denied;
"Dr. Coyle tils,, charges me with 'upbraiding the Episcopalians and Cath
olics for keeping Lent as they do,' The truth is I simply condemned certain
abuses of Lent, while speaking highly of the motives which cause our Catho
\ lie and Episcopal brethren to serve Lent, and earnestly endeavoring to
. lead my congregation into sympathy with tin* real Lenten spirit. I even went
1 so far as to quote an extended passage from the Lenten pastoral of Arch
â  bishop Ireland and heartily commend its teaching to my own people.
' "Dr. Coyle Is quite mistaken if he thinks that I am here as' a censor of
â¢ my brethren. I am here as a friend and brother of all. I desire to co-operate
' with all, Protestant and Catholic. It Is my habit to speak plainly the truth
' as I see it. But I hope it Is always in the spirit of charity. To my mind the
, things which all our churches hold tn common are ten times as many and ten
' times as great as the things which separate us. These are the things that I
' have always made the staple of my preaching. Nothing will give me greater
! satisfaction than to join with Dr. Coyle and all my other Christian brethren
for the advancement of truth, righteousness, peace and love in our city."

. quantity of milk. On removing the cup
1 from his lips the attendant was horrified
'..â¢ see several drops of the lacteal fluid
ooze from the wound in Paulson's throat,
.He hast iiv summoned one of the doctors
of the Receiving Hospital staff, who made
an examination of the wound. He found
it infected, evidently due to the lack of
medical treatment and the unhealthy con
dition of the cell in which ho is cnnf.ned.
The Burgeons at the Receiving Hospital
blame the physicians at the City and
County Hospital for Paulson's condition.
They Pay hat 'my are not expected to
treat cases which have been attended to
by the County Hospital doctors. That
somebody is guilty of gross negligence in

ing occurred to mar the pleasures of the
day. There were games for everybody
and prizes by the score. There was candy
: for the little ones, dancing for the light
footed and refreshments of all kinds. The
children were given their sweets at the
conclusion of the games. They formed
in line behind Yon der Mehden's hand and
to the tune of a "Hot ' "Id Time" they
marched before the committee and re
ceived their packages. The parade was
one of the features of the day, Babes

FILIPINO ACTORS.
Ten of Them Want to Illustrate the
White Man's Burden for a
Salary.
United States Immigration Commission
er North addressed a query yesterday to
the National Commissioner of Immigra
tion at Washington as to the right of ten
detained Filipino Immigrants to be land
ed in this country. The passengers are
to be taken to New York if allowed to
land and exhibited as part of "The
White Man's Burden" In a typical village '
near New York City. They will sing and
dance under contract, and being to thai
extent actors they claim to be entitled to
admission. The doubt in Commissioner
North's mind was is to whether they
were actors, Mr. Powderly replied by
wire:
Filipinos must be examined as other immi
grant!*, and If they coma to this country In
violation "i contract labor laws should be re
fused a landing.
Robert Watchorn, United States Special
Contrnct Labor inspector, arrived irom
the north yesterday morning and called
upon Mr. Xorth. Mr. Watchorn rejected
seventy Japanese immigrants In Seattle
because the* had come to this country
in response to an advertisement of a rail
road company calling for men to work.
He held that this fact made them con
tract labor*
Mr. North has taken the matter of the
Filipinos under advisement.

An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Strui- of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining* the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing tothe
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling* one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently, Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna r.nd
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company
printed on the front of every package.

DB. KILMER'S REMEDIES.
How to Find Out
Fill a bottle or common glass with
your water and let it stand twenty-four
hours; a sediment or settling Indicates
an unhealthy condition of the kidneys;
; if it stains your linen it is evidence of
i kidney trouble; too frequent desire to
- pass it or pain in the back is also con-
vincing proof that the kidneys and
bladder are out of order.
WHAT TO DO.
There is comfort in the knowledge so
often expressed, that Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidney remedy,
fulfills every wish In curing rheuma-
â  tism, pain in the back, kidney;-., liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage, It corn inability to hold
water anil scalding pain In passing it,
or bad effects following use of liquor,
wine or beer, and overcomes that un-
- pleasant necessity of being compelled
to go often during the day, and to get
up many times during the night. The
mild and the extraordinary effect of
Swamp-Root is soon realised, It stands
the highest for its wonderful cures of
the most distressing cases. If you need
a medicine you should have the best.

HOW WE PAID SPAIN.
The $20,000,000 for the Philippines Is Paid j
Without a Ripple.
The circular of Ilenry Clews ays: "The :
payment of the Spanish Indemnity has now
been consummated In a perfectly easy way
and without producing a ripple of disturbance
In the loan market. Under other clrcum- |
stances, it might have called for a consider
able export of gold, and some doubt has been
felt whether we should wholly escape that
result. The balance of trade In our favor
during the bust two years has, however, been I
attended with the accumulation of an extra- j
ordlnarv amount of American funds in Eu
rope on temporary loan. Those funds have
during late months been drawn upon to a con- |
slderable extent In payment for securities re
turned from abroad, and some misgivings
have been felt whether the amount remain
ing to our redit might suffice to cover this
< peratlon. Tlie event has proved that a suf
ficlent supply of bills drawn chiefly against
th.'se funds was procurable for wholly coy- |
erlng this settlement, and therefore no gold j
has been exported. The payment has been j
made wholly through an exchange of inter- j
national credits, without the transfer of a ,
dollar in cash. As the result of these oper
ations, the Treasury accounts show an in- j
crease In "outstanding drafts and checks' from
$6,138,769 on April 29 to $29,171,913 on May 3. 1
the increase of $23,043,144 having gone into the j
banks, while within the same time the Treas
ury deposits In \he banks have been dimin- j
Ished by only $45.112, with the understanding,
however, that those deposits shall be drawn I
down at the rate of $1,000,000 per week to com
penaate for the reduction of the actual cash
balance in the Treasury proper. Therefore the
banks were about twenty-three millions strong- |
er in cash resources at the end of the in- j
demnlt] settlement than they were before, |
while the Treasury was about to the same :
extent weaker.
"Whate\er actual cash may reach Spain in
this settlement will probably be contributed I
largely by Germany, for that country has {
been more than any other a debtor to the
United States in the form of temporary loans j
which we have turned to account as a means !
of paying the Indemnity. It is not unlikely,
however, that Germany may be able to make 1
arrangements indirectly with Spain that will
mitigate the inconvenience of this sudden de-/
mand for large liquidations in cash. The I
Rothschilds are understood to be connected
With the European end of the settlement; and
that might easily mean arrangements between 1
the Bank of Spain and the German bank that
would be convenient to both parties.
â¢'Thus, another bogy that has haunted the
money market and made some people on the j
Stock Exchange uneasy has been removed from
the haunts ot speculation. One of the effects
of the completion of this operation will be, |
as. above indicated, to increase materially for
some time the cash resources of the banks."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 10.â The stock market
moved up sharply to-day, although at times
considerable Irregularity appeared. Large liv
teresta were open purchasers of their special
ties and the absorption of some 70,000 shares
by London aided the market lenders in push
ing up their favorites. In the afternoon, the
rapidity of the advance induced the covering
of large short lines, and commission houses
were again active purchasers. There was no
flurry in the money market, the ruling
rate for call loans being 1 per cent. Sterling
exchange eased off on the large purchases of
stock for I reign account. An element In shap
ing sentiment was a rumor that the Govern
ment crop report to I"- Issued to-day would
show an Improvement of several points over
last month's. St. Paul's favorable weekly
statement of earnings was a source of strength
to the grangers. The lower range of prices
brought about by yesterday's decline proved
attractive to many would-be purchasers, and
while there was no important news in develop
ments, sentiment was completely reversed to
day. Stocks which were the center of weak
ness yesterday, notably the Flower specialties,
v.*ere among the strongest features to-day.
Brooklyn Transit rising VA and Federal Steel
and People's Gas about 4 each. Anion-,- the
specialties there were some very pronounced
advances. Including American Tobacco, 12;
American Smelters, "."V. Steel Hoop and Third
Avenue, "> each; American Steel and AA'ire. 3%;
Tennessee Coal nd Iron and Continental To
bacco, 3". each, nnd Anaconda and Manhat
tan, 3 each.
The railways advanced from 1 to 3*4 points
for active issues, Burlington scoring the ex
treme rise. Metropolitan, which lost a point,
w,*_ the most pronounced exception to Cie gen
eral strength. In the forenoon there was
considerable commission liquidation which in
duced certain professionals to make a drive
at the market, but large operators absorbed
the offerings, two. nouses taking together about
100.0C 0 shares, and this turned the tide, and
a steady improvement followed. A report that
the industrial commission bearing In Wash
ington had been postponed for thirty days led
to purchases of the stocks of some of the com
panies to be investigated. It was reported that
a prominent commission house, after consulta
tion with the financial Institutions carrying its
loans, was forced to sell a large line of stocks
shortly after the opening, and that It was on
sales from this quarter that the market was
temporarily depressed In the forenoon. Prac
tically everything joined in the late advance
and the market closed buoyant at the best.
The railroad bonds participated in the im
prove- speculative temper, but advances were
not material, exes pi in a few instances. Total I
sales $2,380,000. Â«
United States new 4s advanced 4, anil the

THE BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, May 10.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter iii say to-morrow: The wool
market is firm and active. This activity, how
j ever, as was noted last week, is confined mostly
to purchases of territory and pulled wools by
a local speculator and sales from Australian
wool In bond for export. Beyond this very lit
tle business has been done, purchases for con
sumers' account having been very small. About
1,000,000 pounds of Australian wool in bond has j
been bought for export during the past week,
and It is quite possible that all the wool re- '
mainlng here in bond will be taken by for
eigners. The large purchases of territory (
wools referred to, In conjunction with the
strong and advancing markets abroad, have
naturally resulted in some advance in prices.
; lt is difficult to quote with exactness, but,
1 roundly speaking, we should say that there
: had been an advance of between 'J. and 3 cents
per scoured nound on territory wools and an
1 advance of about 1 cent per pound on the
greasy in the past month. The sales of the
week in Boston amounted to 4,778.000 pounds
'. domestic and 2,715,000 foreign, making a total
of 7,593,000, against a total of 6,790,400 for the
previous week and a total of 1,067,000 for the
corresponding week last year. Sales since
January 1, IV'!*, amount to 81,288,300 pounds,
against 44,605,810 last year at this time.
LONDON WOOL SALES.
LONDON, May 10.â The wool sales were con
! tinued to-day after a day's Interruption, owing
to the unfavorable weather of yesterday. One
of the best selections of Merino greasy so far
offered at this series was strongly competed
for. with the French buyers paying extreme
rates. There was all-round eagerness for
scoured, which ruled In sellers' favor. A good
supply of greasy offered showed an advancing
tendency. Punta Arenas sold 5 to 20 per cent
above the March series. The offerings to-day .
numbered 14,982 bales.
CALIFORNIA FRUIT SALES.

OVER UNIQUE
TESTAMENTS
Colusa County Will Case That
Promises Many Sensations
at the Trial-
Big Estate of Henry C. Nelson Tied Up by
Petition of Virginians, Who Allege
Fraud, Indue Influence and
Illegal Execution.
IN a few weeks a will contest will en
gage the Judicial attention of a Colusa
court rivaling the Murdoch case In
point of public Interest. Strange as It
may seem, the petition of the contestants,
containing allegations of a sensational
character, and directly charging some of
the most prominent people of Colusa
County with being parties to the manu
facture of a will and codicil that were
not a good will 01 a good codicil, has been
on file since the beginning of the year
without public exposure. Before this
month has passed the attorneys of both
sides expect the legal battl" to be fought
out In the courts.
The contest Is over the estate of Henry
C. Nelson one of the most prominent
ranchers of Colusa County. He died in
this city on October 31; 1597, leaving an
estate which is valued at $125,000. On No
vember 8 of the same year a will, to
which there was a codicil ached, was
filed for probate by J. Thad Jones, .1. W.
Goad and R. E. Smith. This last will and
testament was admitted to probarte and
letters testamentary Issued. According
to the will the entire estate was be
queathed to nieces and nephews then re
sidir--r In Colusa and other parts of this
State. The contestants are nieces and
FAC-SIMILE OF SIGNATURE TO WILL.
nephews by other' brothers and sisters
residing in the State of Virginia.
The allegations in the petition to have
the order of court admitting the will to
probate set aside are the forerunner of
a most sensational trial, in which a most
unique will and codicil will cut the lead
ing feature. The parties who drew up
both documents will be forced to give
seme Interesting testimony as to their
execution. Th.- writing of the will is ac
credlted to Dr. Thomas Galvan of this
city; that of the codicil to Senator J. W.
â¢'..-ad of Colusa.
The attoruevs for the petitioner are
Bridgford & Clunie. Crittenden Thornton,
Ernest Weigand of Colusa and E. T.
i rane. The defendants are -tented
by Horace G. Piatt of Piatt & Bayne.
Hardly a count is omitted by the peti
tioners' attorneys in their long list of
charges upon which they rely to break
both will and codicil. Duress, fraud, in
competency, undue influence and Illegality
of execution complete the gamut.
me time prior to his death Nelson
came to this city and took lodging at the
I.angham Hotel. He was afflicted with
senile debility, and shortly after his ar
rival was stricken with paralysis. Death
was imminent and his relatives, the de
visees in the will and codicil, flocked to
his Aside to attend him In his last mo
ments. According to the petition at the
time of the drawing up of both instru
ments for the disposition of his property
Nelson could neither see nor hear and
was so enfeebled by age and aisease that
he was unable to form a just or proper
. Igment as to the objects of his bounty.
It is alleged that under the duress of
Willie H. Nelson, Julia Nelson. Emma
Nelson Smith. Ella Nelson McVey, Alice
Davis Lizzie Murphy and Thomas Gal
van the attendant physician, the de.
is<>d was forced into the execution of
the pretended will. It is said that at this
time C II Nelson was sick unto death
and" that Dr. Galvan wrote the will at
their request; also that he wrote the
name of the deceased and inserted his
own name as sole executor without
bonds, mpellng Nelson to yield a pre
tended and enforced consent to the execu
tion of the same.
But the most sensational facts of the
petition are those which relate to the
power exerted over Nelson while on his
deathbed. It is claimed that the devisees
and Dr. Galvan for their own personal
ends and Interests unduly Influenced the
decedent during the latter days of his
life. They are charged with having pro
cured Galvan to draw up the will, and
that Nelson merely went through the
form of signing without freedom of ac
tion, choice or consideration and with
out any knowledge of the contents.
The signature of the will is in the hand
writing of the maker of the Instrument.

AH that is shown of the Intentions of
Nelson to bequeath his estate to the par
ties who are mentioned In the will as
heirs and devisees la bound up in a cross
which is labeled "his mark." This is
shown in the facsimile. The petition de
clares that Nelson did not sign nor sub
scribe the pretended and purported lust
will and testament, but the same was
signed and his mark affixed thereto under
and by the name of Henry C. Nelson by
Thomas Galvan without the command or
request, of the deceased and without his
subsequent approval or ratification. The
will is witnessed by John P. Gallagher
Mrs. R. P. Johnson and E. J. Hill, none
of whom were requested to act in that
capacity, as the petitioners aver.
The will Is as follows:
I, Henry C Nelson, make this my last
will an.l testament I divide my property
equally among my heirs, to-wlt: Mrs. Julia
Jones "I" Oakland; Mrs. Ella McVey, Colusa;
.Mice Davis. Modoc; Emily Murphy, Oak

The codicil in the execution of which
the most prominent parties of Colusa
County are concerned, was executed
some three days later. It is written on
ledger paper and is signed at the bottom
with a scrawl like an Indistinguishable
signature purporting to be that of Henry
' '. Nelson. The codicil reads:
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 20, 1897.
Whereas, I. Henry C. Nelson, of the
count; of Colusa, State of California, did
on the 17th day of October, 1837, make mv
last will and testament In writing, I do
hereby declare this to be a codicil to said
will. I ratify and confirm said will giv
ing all rev real estate and personal prop
erty to Lizzie Smith, Ella McVey, Emma
Murphy, Julia Jones. Alice Davis and
"Willie Nelson to share and share alike,
ratifying and confirming said will In every
respect, save so far as it is Inconsistent
with the codicil. I appoint R. B. Smith. J.
W. Goad and Thad Jones executors to act
with the said Thomas Galvan without bonds.
His
HENRY C. (X) NELSON
Mark
Witness:
R. A. GRAY, M. D
J. A. MURPHY.
(Scrawl.) HENRY C. NELSON.
The facsimile shows that Nelson's name
was written, cross inserted between
Henry and the Initial C, and the words
"his mark" to show that Nelson sanc
tioned its contents. Directly below this is
a hieroglyphic scrawl which bears some
resemblance to the name of the deceased.
It seems that the heirs and devisee of the
will who were In attendance began to
long for more executors, and J. \\". Goad
of Colusa, the attorney of Nelson, was sent
for. Goad, it is alleged, wrote the codicil.
He appears as an executor along with
Thomas "alvan, J. Thad Jones and R. E.
Smith. The petition has it that Goad, at
the instigation of the others, for their
' benefit and for himself as executor,
wrote the codicil and procured the dece
dent to make an Illegible scrawl, alleged
to be the decedent's signature; also that
, he Inserted the executors' names and pro
cured and compelled a submission to the
execution of the codicil.
The most sensational allegation In re
! gard to the codicil Is In the words of the
petition as follws: â¢
"That the "indistinguishable scrawl
1 which is made upon said purported codicil
under the pretended subscription of the
same which was written by the said
J. w. Goad was not declared nor Intend
ed to be the signature to said pretended
codicil by the said decedent, nor was the
same declared by the said decedent to be
his signature to any person whatever."
The culmination to the charges come In
the concluding allegation which denies
that the witnesses Dr. R. A. Gray of
Colusa and J. A. Murphy were requested
to sign as witnesses by C. 11. Nelson, or
that the latter acknowledged the paper
to lie his last will and testament or a
codicil thereto.
The trial of this case will show some
rare developments, if the intimations of
attorneys are based upon evidence ob
tained. At any rate it will attract the
closest attention of that section of the
country in which the land in question Is
situated, both on account of the amount
and parties involved.

Printer Hughes Wins.
Judge Seawell yesterday decided that
the claim of Samuel C. Hughes, a non
union printer, against the city for $95 must
be paid. Auditor Wells refused to audit
the demand on the ground that an ordi
nance passed by the Board of Supervisors
prohibited the awarding of contracts to
other than union printers. They did award
the contract to Hughes, however, and al
lowed his demand. The court therefore
holds that the board repealed the ordi
nance by implication and the demand
must be paid. The validity of the ordi
nance was not brought Into question.
Valuable Horse Impaled.
One of a valuable team of horses be
longing to F. Goss. and kept at Lichen

ficer Potter. While driving from the
stables one of the collar straps broke.
Tho team reared and plunged, and
one of the horses finally got Impaled on a
picket fence. It was frightfully cut
about the body, and to relieve Its suffer
ings Police Officer Potter put a bullet into
Us brain.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 11. 1899:
THE ODD FELLOWS
AND THE REBEKAHS
HELEN M. CARPENTER of Ukiah, Who Will Be President, and
MARY E. DONOHO, Secretary, of the Assembly.
THE entire morning session of the Grand Lodge of
the Independent Order of Odd Fellows was taken
up yesterday in listening to the reports of the spe
cial committee appointed to report on the advisa
bility of maintaining the Odd Fellows' Home at
Thermalito, Butte County. The committee, as has
already been published at length in The Call, was di
vided. It presented a minority and a majority report, and
the reading of these, with the reading of the report of
the trustees of the home, presented by G. H. Morrison,
the president of the board, occupied attention until the
noon recess. In the afternoon a surprise was sprung on
the Grand Lodge which had the effect of shutting off
debate on the matter of the special committee's report
on the condition of the home. This was in the nature of
a supplemental report by the special committee. The
committee recommended the acceptance of the offer of
the Thermalito company, tin offer being to allow the
home to remain Undisturbed for a period of five years,
and if then it appear the place is unfit for home pur
poses on account of being unsanitary the company will
donate the entire property to the odd Fellows to do with
it as the order may decide.
An effort was made to have action taken on the mat
ter at once, but It was said that while the subject mat
ter might be disposed of in that way, it appeared that
SCAVENGERS ARRESTED
ON SERIOUS CHARGES
DUMPED GARBAGE ALONG THE
SAN BRUNO ROAD.
A Practice Which Has Aroused Ob
jection From the Owners of
Adjacent Property.
For several days past scavengers have
been dumping garbage along the line of
the San Bruno road. The principal dump
ing ground chosen by them has been be
tween Blank. ns and the Seven-mile
House. Fifty wagons sought the loca
tion daily, and within a short time every
acre of land In the vicinity was heaped
with refuse of all descriptions. Most of
the stuff was dumped In San Mateo
County, but in many Instances the gar
bage venders did not drive that distance
and left the contents of their wagons
i ear the road in this county.
Property owners raised an objection, and
yesterday two arrests were made in San
Mateo County by Constable McMahon.
T. Rastldl. another vender, was arrested
by Officer P. McKenna ln this county and
was taken to the Seventeenth street sta
tion. The scavengers had sentinels posted
at different points on the road, and news
of the interference on the part of the law
soon spread to the drivers on their way to
the new dumps, and many of them
dropped their loads wherever they hap
pened to stop. Rastldl was one who hap
pened to be detected In the act.
The property owners are united In an
effort to stop the practice and will push
the cases against the parties arrested In
both counties. They say the garbage has
brought sickness among them.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. .1 Noonan. 1017-1023 Mission.
Passed a Fictitious Check.
John J. Sheridan. 1034 Market street,
swore to a complaint in Judge Mogan' 3
court yesterday charging Robert Bu
chanan with passing a fictitious check
upon him on May 4. The check was for
$57. drawn on the First National Bank,
payable to James E. Becker or bearer,
and signed "A. <".. Morgan." It was In
dorsed by Becker. The check was pre
sented at the bank and was marked "no
account." .
Fell Into the Bay.
John Perkins, a laborer, living In Berke
ley, started to drink water front whisky
Tuesday night and about 4 o'clock yes
terday morning he wandered on to Spear
street wharf and stumbled into the bay.
He was rescued by some longshoremen
and sent to the Receiving Hospital, where
he soon recovered.

SO Montgomery st., or any of Its agencies.
the majority of the committee, which had in its first re
port declared against the home, had stultified itself. A
motion was- made that the matter go to print and be
made the special order of business immediately after
the election of officers this afternoon. This was carried.
After that the journal of the previous day was taken up,
but nothing of special interest was done.
The report presented by the president of the board
of trustees of the home is a very complete account
of the condition of the institution, the cost of maintain
ing it and statements of comparison with other homes
of a similar character.
At the session of the California Assembly of Rebekahs
only routine business was transacted, the committees
not being prepared to report. A legacy of $500 from the
estate of the late H. O. Matthews of Charity Lodge of
Stockton was set aside to assist in maintaining a hospi
tal at the Orphans' Home at Gilroy. Individual reports
were received from delegates,* and from these it ap
peared that all the lodges except two are doing well as
to membership and finance. During the afternoon the
assembly was addressed by Grand Master Brueck, Grand
Secretary Shaw and Past Grands Drew and Warboys
and P. G. P. Earlwine. They recommended earnestly
that good representatives be sent to the grand body of
the order to ask for more liberal legislation for the
Rebekahs. V : :
IN THE HANDS OF
THE COURT-MARTIAL
NEALL'S CASE FINALLY SUBMIT
TED TO BROTHER OFFICERS.
Closing of the Judge Advocate's
Argument â Willing to Be Silent
About Neall's Family
Affairs.
The Neall case is In the hands of the
court. The last of the Judge advocate's
argument was submitted yesterday morn
ing, the record and charges were verified
and the whole transcript of the evidence
and of the arguments -were left with the
officers to be referred to in their secret
deliberations.
Captain Noble's argument did not take
many minutes. It was just the few clos
ing paragraphs which the coming of the
closing hour Tuesday afternoon cut off.
It contained on,- important feature. The
judge advocate accepted Mr. Thornton's
view of the fourth specification of the
fourth charge, where ' the allegation is
made that Neall left his wife and chil
dren destitute. Mr. Thornton claimed the
destitution of .Wall's family, until it be
came a matter of public scandal, had no
place in the charges against the accused;
that it was strictly a private matter. The
judge advocate agreed with this view of
tie- specification, and he went further.
it- said the destitution of Neall's family
was plainly due to Neall's hurried flight,
and his flight the judge advocate said
he believed was unpremeditated and for
the purpose of escaping from the inspec
tion to be held the afternoon he disap
peared.
In conclusion Captain Noble expressed
his sincere regret that his duties had led
him to prosecute a brother officer. His
work had been simplified, he said, by the
presence of special counsel for the ac
cused, and just there the judge advocate
paid a neat compliment to Mr. Thorn
ton; and he hoped the court would look
upon his efforts as those of an officer to
the best of his ability fairly seeking the
good of the service.
This ended the formal proceedings of
lite trial. That the record might show
the accused had voluntarily relinquished
his right to testify, lie was asked if he
would give evidence in his own behalf.
Through his counsel he declined to do so.
How long the court will consider the
evidence is a matter for guesswork only,
but even then, unless the finding be one
of acquittal, it will not be made public.
ft will be sent to the commanding gen
eral of this department, who will for
ward it to the adjutant general at Wash
ington, who will deliver it to the Secre
tary of War, who will lay it before the
President, who will approve it or not, as
he sees fit, or alter it to suit his pleasure,
and then approve it. It will take time,

DINGEE FEARS THAT
HIS LIFE IS IN DANGER
HE WILL GO TO EUROPE FOR A
CURE.
Oakland Otlice Ban Fraucisco Call. ,
WS Broadway, May 10.
According to affidavits llled ln the Su- j
perior Court late this afternoon in the
fuit of Jane K. gather against William i
J. Dingee, the latter â¢ man in fear that i
the immediate trial of -the suit would I
endanger his life.
The now famous suit was filed several
month ago and. is brought to recover I
1113.000 which Mrs Bather alleges has i
been misappropriated by Dingee while he I
acted as her agent and banker for about
eight years and up to June 14, 18&?. Din- j
gee recently filed an answer, setting forth
as exhibits two receipts signed by Mrs.
Bather, wherein she declared that Dingee
owed her nothing further and that all
Ids accounts were correct. Tho issues'
being joined, the trial was set for June fi
In Judge Greene's department.
I. ate to-day, however, defendant's at- I
torneys filed notice that on .May 15 they !
will move for a continuance of the trial
until some time later than June 6, on the
around of defendant's serious illness. |
The notice is accompanied by Mr. Din- 1
gee's affidavit, in which he alleges: "That !
the trial will consume at least twenty- I
six court days, as it i overs matters and j
accounts extending over a period of "ten
years; that nearly all the matters I
fr.-'. forth to which defendant will testify
nre alone known to him, and be cannot !
prove the same by any other witnesses; |
that plaintiff and her witnesses will In
nil probability testify to many things
which defendant alone can deny or ex
plain. Â« * â¢
"And that accordingly the mental strain
to be endured and nervous effort neces
sarily required will in all probability
prove so great as to endanger the life of
defendant, and nt least in all probability
destroy bis future usefulness and perma
nently Impair his mental as well as his
physical faculties."
Mr. Dingee'-- affidavit further sets forth
that his present sad condition was
brought about through work of magni
tude during past years, and that he has
made all his arrangements to take, a A-a
caiion to the Eastern States, the Journey
to be extended by a voyage to Europe
"for the purpose of curing himself by
rest and change of climate and surround- I
ings of his present ailment, and that he
may return about November 1."
Together with these documents is filed
an affidavit of Mr. Dlngee's physician. ;
Dr. E. 11. Woolsey. averring that the trial '
of the suit would greatly exaggerate the
nervous disease and Insomnia from which
Mr. Dingee is now Buffering. |

a
From the frozen north comes a tale of
new discoveries of gold fields which cast
in the shade all the stories told of the
fabulous wealth of the Klondike. The
strike which has excited so much ex
citement in the northwest is on Snake
River and its various tributaries. It is
about twenty miles from Cape Nome and
one hundred and twenty miles north of St.
Michael. It is Just outside the United
States military reservation near St.
Michael. The ground 13 all American ter
ritory' and Is comparatively easy of ac
cess, being on the coast.
The miners already on the ground are
using ordinary packing cases and cracker
boxes for rockers and with these crude

Implements work out $200 a day. There |
are stories of claims that run to even $1003
a day. Bedrock la down only six feet and
the ground pays from the first scratch
made in its surface. The people of St.
Michael are in a frenzy over the new
diggings. Corporations were formed as
soon as reports of the discoveries were
received. Employes of the Alaska Com
mercial Company at once sent two men
out of the snowbound region to order
supplies and lumber necessary for work
ing the claims they have taken.
in October of last year the miners of
Snake River organized the new mining
alstrict. The name chosen was Cape
Nome mining district. The outlines of the !
new gold fields were fixed as follows: Ex
tending from Cape Nome in a northwest- i
erly direction along the coast for twenty- !
ive miles and extending twenty-five miles |
inland, making a district twenty-five miles i
square. It was decided that placer!
claims shall be located 1320 feet by 660
feet. Claims may be located by power of
attorney, but this power of attorney
must be recorded prior to the location no- i
tices. All claims must be recorded with
in forty days after the notice is posted i
It was decided that water used for mm- i
ing or otherwise taken from the natural
watercourse must be turned back into
the natural watercourse at the lower end I
-1 each claim. Dr. A. N. Kittlesen was
sleeted District Recorder for the term of
two years, his fees to be $2 50 for record
ing any kind of a document.
Officials of the Alaska Commercial Com
pany, although somewhat conservative in I
their estimate of the value of the new
diggings, admit that another rich district
has been opened. Their representatives !
send them reports of the strike, and they I
believe another such rush as that which
parked the stampede to Dawson City will i
be seen next spring. They do not know I
the extent of the rich deposits as the |
list riot has not been thoroughly gone over
by any one. That their employes have
faith in the strike they believe ls evi
denced by the fact that they sent out i
two representatives with authority to I
turn all the money due them from the
company Into supplies and lumber. The
two messengers who came to the outer
world from their comrades are John
I^ackstrom and F. AY. Randelln. They'
came out over the Ice fields through the i
KuskokWim country, thence to Katmai !
and across to the island of Kadlak. From 1
there they embarked on the regular !
steamer, arriving here on Monday. They
anticipate a big rush when the Ice break" !
permitting vessels to touch at Cape Nome'
The new district will be comparatively j
easy of access as soon as the Ice breaks i
next month. Vessels of any draught can !
reach a point off the coast, though the ''
bluffs are said to be sheer and the anchor- j
age ground a dangerous one. Small stern
wheel steamers can navigate the Snake
River, along which the new diggings are
located, thus solving the question of
transportation, which has been so serious
a one to the people at Dawson City.
The new diggings are said to be "part of >
a strongly defined belt whloh Includes
the Klondike country, the Forty Mile
Circle City mines, the Koyukuk ' strikes :
and thence on rhrough this Snake River
region into Siberia.
According to advices received here, men !
from the surrounding country have been '
flocking to the new district since early in j
December. The big rush from the outside I
world Is expected as soon as the naviga- i
tion will permit. There is a great scar- !
city of wood for fuel and other purposes,
the only available wood being that which ;
drifts ashore. Men are already sawing
this against the time when the demand
for il will be so great as to make it com- i
mand a fancy price. It Is expected a !
camp of 8000 people will be on the ground j
before many months. All the ground in '
the vreinlty of the point of discovery has ,
been staked, Including the land on the
creeks emptying Into the Snake River on i
the east side.
Cape Nome Is the extreme southern 'â¢
point of the peninsula which extends to
Cape Prince of AVales, which is the east- |
crn point of Bering Strait in the north I
and Norton Sound on the south. The j
ships and steamers make Cape Nome and !
then stand in to St. Michael to avoid the
shoal water caused by the discharge of â¢
debris from the Yukon River. The coun- -
try about here has not been prospected,
the efforts of the miners being for many
years directed to inland points and along
the Yukon River.* The present strikes will j
result in a thorough prospecting of the
coast region and Inland from the shore I
line on all sides of Norton Sound.*

Some royal baseball battles are prom
! ised for this week. Manager Harris will
take his men to Santa Cruz for the first
meeting with the Lobsters this season.
The two games on Saturday and Sunday
will have an important bearing on the
position of the local team. A number of
fanatics have signified their intention of
accompanying the team to the sea beach.
WatsonA'ille will come here for a series
of three games with Oaklandâ two at
Recreation Park and a Sunday morning
contest at Golden Gate. AVatsonville has
struck its gait at last, having won the
series last week with Santa Cruz, and Is
now playing as fast ball as any in the
league. Manager Ewing of Oakland,
however, is not at till alarmed; on the
contrary, he is looking forward to the
conflict with great equanimity and avows
his determination to show the hayseeds
a trick or two in the game. With both
teams putting up the warmest kind of
ball some great sport is In store, -for the
lovers of the game here and across the
bay.
At San Jose the Senators will battle
with the prune pickers for target honors
such as they are. Sacramento has been
materially strengthened by the acquisi
tion of Harvey and Egan, and are now in
condition to go up against the best of
them with an even chance of winning.
Oakland has plugged up its only weak
spot by securing Kid Peeples of Sacra
mento. Peeples, who can play any in
field position with equal facility, will be
placed at second, which means the re
lease of Dee Hammond, a promising colt,
but not seasoned enough for his present
company. Manager Kripps wanted to
move Peeples from third to the outfield
and the Kid very properly refused to
make the change, as he Is one of the best
Inflelders In the league. He asked for
his release and It was given him.
Manager Kripps announces that he has
signed a new Innelder, but refuses to dis
close his name at present. He says, how
ever, that the new man will play lirst,
and that he Is a star in the position. It
ls rumored that the phenomenon Is none
other than Doc Hennessy, who organized
the Sacramento team two years ago and
made It the best in the State. Hennessy,
lt is said, will captain the Senators. If
rumor is correct in this instance the Sen
ators will soon be climbing up toward the
top of the heap.
An immense crowd attended the game
at Watsonvilie last Sunday, the largest
that ever witnessed a ball game In thai
town. For the first time* In any, interior
town in the State, it was necessary to
adopt ground rules, so great was the
crowd around third base and in right
field. This speaks well for the game and
the quality of ball played by the league
teams.
Arrelanes was seriously hurt last Sun
day Selna collided with him at second,
dislocating his shoulder-blade. This
means a serious loss to Santa Cruz, for
it la likely that Arrelanes will not be able
to play ball again this season.
The locals forced their way into first
position solely through almost faultless
fielding and terrific hitting. In the three
games last week the* team made a total
of thirty-four hits, including three home
runs, and are charged with only flve er
rors.
Harris is more than pleased with the
work of his outfield. He is positive there
Is not another trio in the league who can
compare with them.
It looks as though Graham, the Santa
Clara College professor, will play with
San Jose Instead of Watsonvilie. In fact
he is billed to play flrst with the prune
pickers this week.
Cahill will umpire this week's series
between Oakland and Watsonvilie.
"White Wings" has already become a fa
vorite by his impartial decisions and bids
fair to occupy the place in the esteem
of the fanatics that Jack Sheridan for
merly held.
President Moran has decided the Egan
case in favor of San Jose, and Truck has
been ordered to report to Borchers not
later than Friday. With Graham and
Egan San Jose will have a strong Infield.
Moreover, ODea has begun practice and
will be ready to go into the game next
week. The infield will then, in all prob
ability, consist of Graham, first; Ander
son, second; O'Dea. short, and Egan or
Hanlon third, the other going into right
field ln place of Foley. Can anybody fig
ure out a much stronger team?
Shea has been released by Oakland, not
having shown the necessary qualifica
tions for a California league pitcher.
Manager Ewing also has several other
changes under way.
With the signing of Harvey and Rus
sell the league is well provided with south
side pitchers. Donlin is one of that kind.
When Sacramento opened up on the
Oaklands last Sunday the crowd fairly
went crazy. Hitting Is what the cranks
revel In, and it was the first time this
season that the Sacramentans had been
given a taste of their faA-orlte dish. ,,
Hardin still leads the league in bat
ting, with Billy Hammond second and
Pace a close third. Josh Riley is going
to give them a run for the honor, though.
Russell went into last Sunday's game
when he ought to have been in bed. The
Senators fairly slaughtered him, and
Shea, who relieved him, fared no better.
The locals boast that not a team has
scored more than four runs in any game
from them this season. Pretty close ball,
that!
In Anderson San Jose has the fastest
second baseman in the league. One of the
big league teams wlll be reaching out for
the "Terrible Swede" before many sea
sons.
Such slugging as that was at Oakland
Sunday morningâ four home runs and a
triple In one gameâ ls remarkable. The
left field fence, over which the homers
sailed, ls 225 feet from the plate.
Watsonvilie is panting for another go
at Hank's men. Now that the "hoodoo"
is shattered they say nothing in the
league can stop them.
Tip O'Neil may not be the best inflelder
in the league, but he is far and away the
best field captain. Tip knows every point
In the game and is quick to take advan
tage of every* situation. To him alone
Is due the credit for the magnificent team
work that now marks the playing of the
Friscos. The players have every confi
dence In him, and the greatest harmony
prevails in the team.
Santa Cruz will play Frisco at Recrea
tion Park on May 27 and 28. Watch out
for some good games.
It is not all glo|>m at the quarantine
station at Angel .Inland, as is shown by
a ball game played last Monday between
teams from the crew of the transport
Sherman. The teams styled themselves
the "Smallpox" and tfe_ "Varioloids,"
the former winning by a score of 14 to 8.
Captain C. 11. Grant umpired the game.
SEIZED STRIPED BASS.
Game Warden Fallon Confiscates a
Quantity of the Game Fish That
Was Under Legal Weight.
Fish and Game Warden James J. Fal
lon seized 500 pounds of striped bass yes
terday and confiscated it. The fish was
all under the size allowed by law, hence
the action of the alert official.
Three hundred pounds were consigned
to Paladinl & Co., and the remainder to
the American Fish Company. As It was
all in prime- condition a number of chari
table institutions will profit by the
seizure. Mr. Fallon sent a box to the
Almshouse, another to the Youths Di
rectory and a third to Mount St. Joseph a
Orphan Asylum.
The fish was sent by express from near
Sobrante station.

Peter Wyberg, millionaire mine-owner

the best thing that ever trod the gilded
paths of the tenderloin, lias taken unto

berg predict that Peter will find her a .
valuable ally in his money spending ca- j

twenty-one summers, and her friends i
choose to call her Ruth Harrison.
The marriage was in extremely quiet
affair the ceremony having been per
formed by Judge Barry the latter part
of last week. Only the Judge and two
witnesses were present, and -it is need
less to mention that the millionaire mine
owner was the real thing in a monetary

it was to be present at the marriage. The

bride, of course, fell heir to a princely
fortune in spot cash. To be wed to YVy

wealthâ is possibly one of the greatest
pieces of good fortune that could befall
one of Miss Ruth's tendencies. She Is

Of $10,000.
. Wyberg. who is fat and forty, arrived
in this city from Dawson City early last
spring. He brought $75,000 in gold" dust
with him, and on arriving here he regis
tered at the Commercial Hotel. After
taking his first whirl on the primrose
paths Wyberg lived wherever he hung his
hat or where the pop of the last bottle
found him. In his sizzling course along
the cocktail route Wyberg left a trail of

Immediately after the marriage cere

Millionaire Wyberg and his butterfly
bride embarked on the steamer last Sat

TEACHERS' HEADS
IN THE BASKET
Board of Education
Ax Falls Again.
â Â« â
The Board of Education held a pro
tracted session last night and transacted
a large amount of business, incidentally
complimenting President Bergerot and at
th.- same time giving Harrington, presi
dent of the old hoard of unsavory' mem
ory, a back-handed swipe by resolving
that the "Harrington School shall here
after be known as the Bergerot School."
In addition the board cut off the official
heads of a number of teachers in even
ing schools, placed others on the unas
signed list and made a number of trans
fers; also abolishing the head of the chem
ical department in the Lowell High
School.
When the board was called to order at
8:30 p. m. by President Bergerot all the
members were present, with the excep
tion of Director Head.
Superintendent Webster announced that
he had received the report of School~Cen
sus Marshal John Elbert, and in his opin
lon the report was faithful and correct.
The cost was $4939, a saving of $3267 on
the cost of taking the school census In
1898.
The board then resolved itself into a
committee of the whole and went into
executive session. The result of the com
mittee's deliberations is as follows:
MEDALS FOR THE LOYAL
SONS OF CALIFORNIA
THE following address has been prepared by the grand president of the ?
Native Sons to be promulgated throughout the order and throughout th.- j.
State: â¦
SANTA CRUZ, May 10. 1899. i- # >
To the Subordinate Parlors of the Native Sons of the Golden Westâ â¦
Dear Sirs and Brothers: In accordance with a resolution adopted by the y
Grand Parlor at Salinas, I have appointed a committee to act in conjunc- <-â¢

bringing to fulfillment the idea of presenting medals to the Californians, -J,":
native and adopt,.!, who enlisted In the war with Spain. r *
The subordinate parlors are requested to act as a committee in the Â«â  â¢â 
several sections of the State 'â  where they may be located to collect funds, *
either through subscription, entertainment or other popular methods, for , V
this patriotic purpose. The good will of the people should be enlisted in J,*
order that the affair may be a success. The medals are to come from the â¦
people in acknowledgment of their appreciation of patriotic services, and ;Â«;
the order of Native Sons of the Golden West simply becomes their agent Â«
in carrying out the will of the people. g$
Moneys may be forwarded to Henry I.unstedt, grand secretary, 41-1 Â«
Mason street, San Francisco, and the disbursement of th. funds acquired c*
will be under the control and supervision of the following committee of Â±
fifteen, who, in conjunction with the newly elated board of grand officers, .â¢

According to School Census Marshal El
len's report, the number of school chil- !
(Inn between the ages of 5 and 17 is 72,292, \
or 944 less than appears by the sen
census of last year. The census for this
year shows an Increase of 1221 children :
i under live years of age over the figures -
given a year ago, the totals being 21,855
for 1898 and 23,070 for 1899. The totals for :
'. all ages up to 17 Is 98,368 for 1899, against
98.091 for 1898, or an Increase of 277.
The board appropriated $6000 for the ex
pense of taking the census and Mr. Ellert ;
will turn $1009 back into the school fund, j
something unprecedented in the history
of the department. A year ago an ap
propriation of over $8200 was entirely con
sumed, and even that amount did not
represent the entire cost of the school
census, which approximated $12,000. The
difference between the latter amount and
the appropriation was obtained through
a system of jugglery with the School De
partment funds, which only the mem
bers of the late and unlamented old board
can explain.
Although it appears by the figures given
in Mr. Ellen's report that the number of
school children in San Francisco between
the ages of 5 and 17 has decreased
slightly during the past year, such is not
the case. The apparent decrease is ac
counted for in the terse statement of Su
perintendent Webster that the census of
1899 is "an honest census." it is generally
understood that the census of 1898 was
padded in so far as it related to children
between the ages of 5 and 17 in order i
that the State allowance for school chil
dren between those ages might be in
creased.

only standing room where everything
could be beard and where nothing could

The entertainment was given - for the

it was worthy was abundantly proved by
the very large attendanceâ attendance
that equaled the best record of the spa

Fire in a Cigar Factory.
Early this morning the cigar factory
and store of M. Lichtenstein at 268 and
270 O'Farrel street was discovered to be
on fire by a lodger who occupied a room
over the place. An alarm was turned in
from box VI. but the Are was not gotten
under control until about $1000 worth of
stock had been destroyed. The fire is sup
posed to have started by the overturning
of a lamp. The building, which is a two
story frame, was not damaged to any
great extent. The upper floor is occupied
'as a lodging-house, and when the cry of
fire was raised there was a lively scram
ble among the guests for an exit.
