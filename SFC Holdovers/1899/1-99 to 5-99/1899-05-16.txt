HAVANA, Cuba, May 15.â
The situation here has be
come most alarming. To
all appearances Cubans are about
to make armed manifestations
inst the United States and its
mode of governing the island, al
though the conservative element
still hopes for peaceful arrange-
ments.
This state of affairs, which was
brought abruptly to a head last
Saturday by a partial quarrel be
tween General Gomez and Gov
ernor General Brooke, has been
f< Tining for the last two months.
The first move lias been made by
the army. It will probably be
supported by many Cubans. Cu
bans in general argue that they
are being browbeaten by the |
Americans, who daily tighten |
their grip upon them. To a cer
tain extent this is true. Ameri
cans are more favored here by
Government officials daily while
each move of the Government,
such as the construction of a new
Postoffice, with its signs written
in English, tends to carry out the
assertion of Cubans that the
Americans are here to remain.
The army, which is really rep
resented, although many dispute
his authority, by General Gomez,
is particularly bitter against Gov
ernor Brooke and his policy. The
soldiers declare they have been
miserably fooled and trapped by
the Americans. They look upon
the exchange of a gun for $75 as
an ignominious transaction for
them, as they have not been de
feated by the Americans and con

Borne persons say the determination '
of the army not to surrender the arms i
is an outsome of General Brooke's re- |
fusal to sanction General Gomez's plan i
for a Cuban militia. At Cuban head- |
quarters the statement is indiarinantly
', denied, in by Gomez, who.
' however, refused to discuss the present
I situation. One of Gomez's most promi- j
nent officers said:
"General Gomez was brought to this
city through the influence of Mr. Por
ter. He was told at the time he was
; wanted in Havana to help General
Brooke establish a government for the
Cubans which would have no other
basis than freedom and independence, j

of Brooke's scheme. He wished to ren- j

might with further ease follow out his
orders from Washington.

AT the Front With Lawton's
Column, San Miguel, Sunday
(via Manila, May â¢ 15).â The
insurgent General Gregorio del Pilar
believes that he has been deserted by
the Filipino Government, and desires
to surrender, if he can secure what
he regards as honorable terms from
the Americans.
â  It is now said that Aguin- m
â¦ aldo has fled into the prov- â¦
â¦ ince of Nueva Ecija. On April â¦
29 he retreated by carriage *
â f from Balinag through San Isi- Â£
+ dro, and nothing has been +
â¦ hear! from him in the two â¦
1, weeks since. H
The 5000 Spanish prisoners who
are reported to be held by the insur
gents have been carried into a north
ern province and scattered among the
small garrisons. They are beyond
American succor this season unless
the Filipino surrender takes place
within three weeks.
The insurgent hospital near San
Isidro is reported to be overwhelmed
with the wounded. General Pilar's
main subsistence depot is five miles
in front of Lawton.
The indignation of the natives has
compelled the insurgent generals to
countermand their orders to burn
towns as they retreated.
Th~ American policy of not de
stroying property is creating a re
vulsion in our favor. Five American
prisoners were carried through this
town last week. Their names are un
known.
Natives are returning through the
American lines to their own homes.
AGUINALDO'S SKILL
AS A PREVARICATOR
LONDON. May 15.â The Filipino Jun
ta here has received the following mes
sage from Aguinaldo, cabled from
Hongkong under date of May 12:
The Filipino Government, in accordance
with the general feeling of the country,
haa decided to continue the war at all
costs until independence is secured. The
Filipinos energetically refuse the Ameri
cans" peace overtures based on restricted
autonomy coupled with promises of a
subsequent self-government. The Fili
pinos demand a strict fulfillment of the
articles of the American constitution and
of the treaties contracted by the Ameri
can representatives when imploring a
Filipino alliance in combating the Span
iards.
All the Filipino generals support Aguin
aldo. General Luna's reported overtures
for peace are untrue. Our army is near
Manila, simultaneously attacking the
whole American line.
The heat and rains are causing many
casualties in the American army. All the
hospitals are crowded with sick and
wounded. Four hundred of the Cincinnati
regiment have been imprisoned by Gen
eral Otis for insubordination in refusing
to tight. The regular troops quartered in
Manila and other towns are quiet. The
volunteers are abused and always at th>
frorit with .scanty rations. The discontent
between the Americans and Europeans is
general. â¢**

It is expected that the necessity for the
return of the volunteers in the island
of Luzon will not exist much
longer, and when the volunteers reach
their native States for muster out Mr.
McKinley hopes to be there to greet
and honor them. If the trip t<> the West
alreafly planned should not occur when
the volunteers are returning another
journey will be made to carry out this
purpose.
TORTURE FOUR LITTLE

Horriblo Crime a. Which a Mulatto
Woman and Her Husband
Are Detected.
ATLANTA. Oa., May 15.-Winnie
Roach, a mulatto woman, and her hus
band, are charged with having brutally
burned their four little children nearly
to death by Igniting paper, saturated with
kerosene, with which their bodies had
been wrapped. The man, Lawrence
Roach, run away during the afternoon
when he heard that his treatment of his
children had been reported to the police.
The woman was in the act of applying
fire to one of the children when a crowd
broke in. The police were summoned, as
a lynching was feared. The woman and
the children were taken to the station.
One of the children had all the flesh
burned from her legs in .several places
and probably will die. The other three
are all badly burned.

EDUCATORS DIFFER
FROM HUNTINGTON
EX-MAYOR
HEWITT'S
SENTIMENT
Says Collis Bases His Ideas
Upon His Own Ex
perience.
NEW YORK, May 15.â Widespread
interest was created to-day by
the remarkable arraignment of
modern education made by Col
lis P. Huntington last Saturday
night at a banquet in San Francisco.
Mr. Huntington had said that the
masses were being overeducated. and
that the young were spending too many
years in school. He spoke of fifteen
years as the limit of educational activ
ity. Among those who read Mr. Hunt
ington's speech was Abram S. Hewitt,
also an exceedingly successful man, but
of a different school. . Mr. .Hewitt is a
college graduate. He is the secretary
of the Cooper Union, founded by Peter
Cooper for the education of the work
ing classes.
"Mr. Hunting-ton," said Mr. Hewitt
to-day, "bases his ideas upon his own
experience. He thinks that because he
got along with little schooling others
can do the same. What he did learn
certainly did him no harm. He need
not complain that boys did not leave
school early enough. Most of them in
this city are out of school by the time
they are fifteen years old.
"We take them into Cooper Union at
the age of 15 years. That is on the
supposition that they no longer have
any chance to attend the day schools.
I I do not believe that there is any dan
ger of overeducating the masses. Any
thing which elevates the people can do
them no harm. The world progresses
by the dissemination of knowledge. If
knowledge is not a benefit we might
as well go back to the Middle Atr.s.
Anything which makes the world hot
ter should bt- encouraged. I am afraid
that Mr. Huntington has come in con
tact with who have tried to
impose upon him. The world is full of
the shiftless and the indolent; yet in
! public schools It will be found that the
boys are bright, eager and ambitious.
STEPPACHER APPOINTED
REGISTRAR OF VOTERS
JAKE BREAKS IN.
GOVERNOR GAGE yesterday ap- i
pointed Jacob Steppacher Regis- |
trar of Voters for the city and
county of San Francisco, to suc
ceed W. J. Biggy. The appoint
ment was no surprise to the public,
as The Call of Sunday last contained the ,
information that Gage had made up his
mind to recognize the claims of Major
Frank McLaughlin by appointing Step
pacher to the office of Registrar.
There is no doubt that McLaughlin de- ;
sired his friend Steppacher to succeed, ;
but the fact is well known to the small :
coterie of politicians in the confidence of i
the Governor that the appointment which I
ABRAM S. HEWITT.
I believe that most American boys now
wish to learn trades. There would be
no "gangs" of dissolute and idle young
fellows if all had an opportunity to
learn a trade. The trade unions have
been trying ti> keep them out. It is all
right for workingmen to seek to raise
their wages as against their employ
ers and as against society, but they
have no right to keep others out. That
is a wrung of the worst character. Mr.
Huntington would have succeeded, edu
cated or uneducated. He is a man of
indomitable energy and conspicuous
ability. He was bound to rise. It does
not follow that because he was success
ful without much schooling that others
can reach success with no education.
It all depends upon work. It happened
that I was well educated. Yet I did
not stop to think about that. I did
what work came to my hand, whether
I liked it or not."
Joseph J. Little, president of the
Board of Education, said that he had
read the address of Mr. Huntington
with much Interest.
"It is to be regretted," he said, "that
Mr. Huntington is not here to explain
his views in more detail. If by educa
tion he means a study of classics for
the laboring people he may not be far
wrong. I think that his views are,
however, on the whole erroneous. Yet
it is a deplorable fact that it is hard
to find men who are good mechanics.
; It was only recently that I had oceft
! sion to advertise for an assistant book-
I keeper. The work was light and the
I position was not worth more than $10
i or $15 a week. At the same time I ad
' vertised for a man to take charge of
a mechanical dcrartment, the wages of
i which were four times more than that

the major most desired to control was
that of Democratic Commissioner to the
Paris Exposition. McJ-aughlin earnestly
desires that his prospective son-in-law,
Samuel Rucker of San Jose, should have
a place on the Paris Commission.
Politicians on the inner circle of the
coterie assert that the Governor positive
ly announced that he would not appoint
Rucker. It is understood that the ap
pointment of Steppacher was made to
soften the expected wrath of the major
over the turning down of Rucker. Queer
things happen in public life nowaday.-,
and the Governor may again change his
mind and decide to give Rucker the
coveted commission. At last accounts,
however, the chief executive said his pur
pose to appoint a big Democrat from San

graduates, answered the advertisement
for the assistant bookkeeper and only
six applied fur the other position.
"Mr. Huntington, I do not believe,
has ev.er been in a schoolroom since he
left it. From what I know of schools
in various parts of the country I am
convinced that his criticism of modern
education is extreme. Schools of the
present day are constantly becoming
more practical. The pupils are taught
to observe, to think for themselves.
They are receiving instructions in man
ual training which is preparing them to
go into useful trades. Teachers are be
ing prepared to instruct their pupils
in manual arts. The system of educa
tion has greatly improved and devel
oped since Mr. Huntington went to
school. There is a tendency among
parents to seek to educate their chil
dren above mechanical work. I think
that this tendency will be corrected.
Manual training will assist in doir.s so
and just such discussions as Mr. Hunt
ington has raised will be exceedingly
helpful. Mr. Huntingdon is a man of
ability. He is a man of affairs, and I
do not believe for a moment that li>'
would have our workingmen ignorant.
As I understand it, he does not believe
in so much classical education. He
would not, in other words, have brick
layers read Greek and Latin; but, after
all, I do not know that would do the
bricklayers any harm."
Professor Van Amringe, dean and
acting president of Columbia Univer
sity, said Mr. Huntingtan's success
without any college education did not
prove that a classical training was not
good for the. majority of men.
"It is the purpose of the university."
he continued, "to prepare men for
every field of usefulness. Student?"
faculties are trained and stimulated so
that they may be ready to cope with
complex problems of the present day.
Mr. Huntington is a man of genius. He
would have attained success under any
circumstances. As to the question of
education of the masses, that is a very
grave matter and T do not care to dis
cuss it at present."

Â© SAN RAFAEL, May 15.â John Soarez. a ranch hand working near #
*! Greenbrae, nearly lost his life to-day while trying to save his dog from *S
Â§ an attack by two large coyotes. As a rule the coyote is a cowardly ani- g
.â¢ mal and will seldom fight. Soarez, however, can testify that when the %;
O coyote is enraged it makes a dangerous adversary. . â¢ S
Â£ While Mrs. Pi. an.'., the wife of Major H. S. Picand of Chicago, who Â£j
Â» is staying at the Hotel Rafael, was being driven along the Tiburon 2S

Â£ the hill back of the old Prenty place, and directed the attention of Coach-. 3
ji> man "Jack" Hayes to the scene. Hayes perceived that the animals were %%
.;. coyotes and that the dog was getting the worst of it, as one coyote was o
v continually attacking it from the rear. Thinking the dog would make for *^
t\ home when things grew too interesting, Hayes drove on. Â£â¦
V Shortly afterward Soarez perceived the battle, and, rushing to the $
i; spot, kicked one of the coyotes on the side. It turned and with a savage â¢*
Q spring fastened its teeth in his leg. Soarez had no weapon and was Â£â¢
** badly bitten by the angry beast before the remaining coyote found itself #
$ no match for the dog and ran. In response to Soarez's yells the dog then \

War Department taken an optimistic view
of the situation, expressing the i>eiir>f thai
he can accomplish the distribution and
disarmament of the Cuban army without
the aid of General Gomez, the authorities
are not a little concerned over the atti
tude of other Cuban leaders. They fear
that their influence with the rank and

cable arrangement being reached with
the Cuban soldiers. In view of whai
happened, tho authorities here think Gen

disarmament proposition with a firmer
hand than has hitherto ehurarterizeil the
negotiations. Up to the (Use of office
hours to-day, Secretary Alper said Gen

his next move would be, but he assumed
that lie would issue a proclamation Bet

under which members of tiie Cuban army
would be allowed to Ehare in the allot

prompt surrender of their arms.
The authorities will wait for the next

changes in the preseni conciliatory policy.
The first si.nn of open revolt, nowever,
will be dealt with promptly and vigor
ously. Such a revolt would probably be
the deathblow to the independence of the
island, tor. as, a Cabinet officer "expressed
it to-day, the United States would never
consent to relinquish its hold on the
island if the leaders, whom we befriended
in the expectation that they would be
able eventually to manage tho affairs of
the island, openly attack us.
Major General Matthew C. Butler of
South Carolina arrived in Washington
this morning, direct from Cuba, As a for
mer member of the Cuban Commission
General Butler takes a keen interest In
affairs of the island, and his recent visit
was vemi-offirial in characti r. Speaking
of the present conditions in Cuba c,en
eral Butler says there is a general feel
ing of uncertainty and distrust as to
Gomez, and unless all siyns fail there
will he trouble with tho Insurgent chief
over the distribution of th< $3 000 which
the United states Governmeni seni down
there to be distributed among the Cu
bans.
"One of th-- greatesi mistakes < >ur Gov
< rnment has made in Cuba," said Gen
eral Butler, "was the sending of that
money there to be distributed among
'i.'iiT-z and bis followers. Gomez is nat
urally a lawless fellow, who cannot be
depended upon to carry out his prom
ises. He is a. professional agitator, and
has among his followers many of a simi
lar type. They distrust each other and
an- striving to pain some personal ad
vantage in connection with affairs on the
island. They are scheming to get the
lion's share of the $3,000,000, and 1 antici
pate they will give our people eonslder
able trouble for a long time to come.
Unfortunately some of our officialsâ l do
not care to mention namesâ are disposed
to regard Gomez as a great soldier, and
the most influential man in Cuban ranks.
With a certain element there he may have
considerable influence, but among those
Cubans who are anxious for a peaceful
and business-like solution of the prob
lems there present* d lie is not popular.
They feel thnt lie would not hesitate to
sacrifice their interests to advance his

RIOT OF CUBANS
AT CIENFUEGOS
CIENFUEGOS, Province of Santa
Clara, May 15, 8 p. m.â About 5 o'clock
this afternoon a gang of Cuban dock
laborers called upon Captain Barker, cap
tain of the port, and made a demand for
back pay. As they were violent, Captain
Barker drew his revolver. The laborers
retired, but returned soon after with fifty
'others and made a similar demand, us
ing obscene and profane language, insult
ing Captain Barker and offering threats
The Cuban police were ordered to ar
rest the malcontents, and a general street
nght followed. In wjiieh one laborer was
killed and several persons were wounded
including three members of the police
I rce.
As the Cuban populace became very in-
I suiting and threatened revenge, an out
break was expected, and the Second
United States Infantry Regiment was
ordered Into the city. The troops are
patrolling the town this evening.
The Cubans are well armed, and about
an hour ago firing was heard in Declute
street near the Custom-house, although
this was probably only harmless mis
chief, as the Second Infantry patrol on
investigating the locality, found no one
who could be made responsible.

TO SURRENDER ARMS

siderable dissatisfaction la expressed here
over the demand by the United States
Government that the Cuban soldiers re

shares in the distribution of the $3,000,000.
La Independenela and other papers pub
lish excited articles protesting against the
acceptance of any such proposal.
La Indeppndcneia suggests that a slamp
tax be instituted, by means of which loyal
Cubans would be enabled to "save the
soldiers from the dishonor and humilia

their liberty.
On all sides among the CubaJis of San

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 16, 1899.
TOD SLOAN FAST
BREAKING DOWN,
May Soon Have to Quit
Riding.
Special Dispatch *n The Call.
LONDON, May 15.â "Tod" Sloan, the j
American jockey, whose phenomenal |
success in the saddle has made him one j
of the most talked about men in Ens- j
land, is failing in health at Newmar
ket, and for some time has been ridine
contrary to the instructions of his Dhv- j
sician.
While Sloan has been going on win- |
ning with horses that could not win
j without his assistance, he has been
i working at the expense of his physical
and nervous reserve. His friends have
tried to persuade him to take a rest,
but he has persistently refused to listen j
to them. Now he is on the verge of a
| breakdown and those interested in his |
welfare are seriously alarmed.
Sloan's true condition was known to ;
only a few before yesterday, but to-day j
the prediction is freely made that he
; will ride but few more races, at least
' in England. His constitution seems to !
be thoroughly undermined, and the i
most serious consequences are feared.
Sloan either refuses to discuss his con
j dition or passes it off with a llippant j
i remark, but it is known that at last he i
fully realizes his danger, it Is possi
ble that he may return to America be
fore the English racing season is con
cluded.

red-hot affair, both teams being keyed up to

feeling. It was a slugging match, punctuated
by sensational fielding and constant wrangling
with the umpires. Brooklyn punched out three
runs In the third inning by successive bunts,
and the Quakers succeeded in tleing the score

home run, and Dunn, Yeager and Casey were
safe on a. pair of scratch hits and Cooley'a

George Dixon added another to his long

rounds in the Olympic Club to-night.
Broad was in the best possible condition,
but Dixon carried considerable superflu

in Dlxon's corner. Broad forced the fight

all his old-time cleverness, but not his

GREETING TO THE
PYTHIAN KNIGHTS
Grand Lodge Delegates and
Rathbone Sisters Arrive
in Numbers.
SANTA CRUZ. May 15.â The Knights of
Pythias and the Rathbone Sisters of
California have possession of Santa Cruz.
The city has been given over to th. m and
the Santa Cruzans are lavish in their hos
pitality to the guests. Seldom has the
city been so nicely decorated. Scarcely a
store is without its garb of bunting, and
everywhere are to be seen the mottoes
"Welcome Sir Knights." "K. of P. Wel
come," "The City Is Yours." The yel
low, red and blue of the order covers the
front of the business houses, while the
national flag is floating from all the flag
poles. The Courthouse has the Ameri
can colors Hying to the breeze from
every window. The avenue is brightened
by myriads of streamers.
Everywhere is to be seen the Sir
Knights with the elegant local lodge
badge, and all the visitors wear the
Grand Lodge badge, which is presented to
eacb delegate. Suspended from a brass
knight design is a red ribbon badge; up
on it in silver letters are the words:
"lirand Lodge. California; Santa Cruz,
1i>99." From the ribbon is a circular cel
luloid pendant with the lodge emblem
upon it in the Knights of Pythias colors.
The Rathbone Sisters are conspicuous
on the street with their white, red, yel
low and blue colors, which, interpreted,
are the motto of the order: "Purity,
Love, Equality and Fidelity;" while the
motto of the Knights is "Friendship,
Charity and Benevolence." The Knights
have a gayly decorated and spacious
headquarters off the main office at the
St. George Hotel, while the Kathbone Sis
ters have their quarters in the floral dec
orated parlors on the second floor. The
headquarters is where the Knights meet
and friendships are formed.
With the arrival of every train there
has been a rush to the hotels. One tem
ple has a novel way of entertaining it
self while here. The Salinas Temple of
the Rathbone Sisters has pitched its
tents and is camping at Camp Capitola.
The members make the trip to the city
each day and return after the night ses
sion.

TO CONTROL FRUIT
TRANSPORTATION
Growers to Meet at the
Capital.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, May 15.â There will
be a meeting at the State Capitol to
morrow afternoon of the transporta
tion committee of the Fruit Growers'
convention. recently held at Fresno, of
which R. D. Stephens, the Sacramento
orchardist and shipper, is chairman.
The meeting is fraught with great in
terest to the fruit growers of the State,
since its purpose is to take the initial
steps toward an organization to wrest
the business of shipping fruit from the
combine that controls it and to placing
it in the hands of the shippers them
selves.
R. D. Stephens is the father of the
movement and he is enthusiastic in his
claims. To-night he declared to The
Call correspondent that if the shipping
of the fruit was confined to the ship
pers they would be able to place their
products in the Eastern markets at
one-half the present cost and still make
a good profit on the transportation
charges. Mr. Stephens declared the
proposed organization would not be op
pressive to any of the members. Or
chardists, he said, did not grumble at
paying their State and county taxes,
nor their fire and life insurance assess
ments, in order to better protect their
property while they were alive and to
conserve it for their families after their
death. Mr. Stephens said that if the
growers succeeded in forming the con
templated organization they would be
masters of the situation. As it is now,
the moment an individual shipper sends
a consignment to a certain point to an
independent agent the two refrigerator
companies divert their consignments to
that point, glutting the market which
the individual grower had hoped to en
ter and effectually dispelling his dream
of realizing something on his crop.
Under the contemplated system of co
operative transportation the shippers
will be able to send their fruit to mar
kets where they know it will meet
with ready sales. Beside, they will have
a hold on the various railroad lines,
since they will be able to say upon
which lines they prefer to send their
cars. Since the business of carrying
these refrigerator cars is profitable to
the railroad lines the growers will have
no difficulty in obtaining fair treatment
and the most favorable transportation
rates.
Mr. Stephens said to-night that to
morrow afternoon's meeting would be
in every sense? public, and that not orly
were the orchardlsts urged to be pres
ent, but the representatives of the re
frigerator companies and other ship
pers also, to the end that there might

HUNTING TO'S WORK
IN WASHINGTON
Dark Ways of Aiding
Railroads.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters. Wellington Hotel.
Washington, May 15.
The Call has shown that C. P. Hunt
ingdon's lobbyists in Washington in
terceded at the Treasury Depart
ment for the reinstatement of Ben
Meredith as Inspector and Chief of the
Chinese Bureau at San Francisco, in or
der to Continue the protection of the dis
honest Chinese passenger traffic of the
Pacific Mail. This calls to mind prac
tices of Mr. Huntington's agents here be
fore the United States Land Office. The
Btbry has been printed before, but addi
tional facts and details are herewith pre
sented. â¢
As is well known the California people
have, almost single-handed and alone,
fought against the extension of the Pa
cific Railroad debts to the Government.
This was but natural, for in that State
the Southern Pacific Railroad has an ex
clusive monopoly of transcontinental
fares and freight charges and is enabled
to extort from the producers and Ship
pers its own price for transportation.
The California people objected to an ex
tension of the debt, for Mr. Huntlngton
would thereby continue to derive from the
people money with w...ch to meet the pe
riodical payments of principal and lnt( r
est to the Government, required by the
".funding bin."
Besides they hoped that the Govern
ment would foreclose on the railroad by
reason of the company's deiault in meet
ing its just obligations, just as one cred
itor in an ordinary business transaction
may foreclose on a debtor. But Mr. Hunt
ington, through the employment of a
powerful lobby in Washington, has al
ways been able to defeat the Will of the
people. Always, save one time, when thu
honest members of the Hous.- def<
the extension bill. But In the las; Con
gress the persevering and indomitable
HuntlngtCj. caused to be reported from
the House Committee on Pacific Railroads
and passed a bill providing for a com
mission to settle the debts of the rail
road. This was what he had been striv
ing for for years. The commission was
empowered to extend the debts for an
other period of ten years, if in its dis
cretion this was considered wise. This
bill pleased Huntington, of course, for he
realized that it is easier to control a com
mission composed of but a few members
than It is to purchase a majority of the
House of Representatives.
And in this connection there is no man
ner of doubt that Huntington has used
money lavishly in Washington to accom
plish his ends. According to his own con
fession he spent money freely in having
matters "explained" to members of Con
gress by his agents. But this is not all.
He has not only employed ex-members of
Congress (who have access to the floor
of the House) to lobby for him, but he has
sent money in the departments to previ nt
the cancellation of land patents to his
railroad.
Francis M. Gideon, formerly of Indi
ana, but who was appointed from Mis
souri to be chief of one of the divisions of
tli.- Ceneral Land Office while yet clerk
in that office was employ^! by one of
Huntington's agents to r-si^n his place
and "correct" some iand entries made by
the railroad in previous years. The Pa
cific roads were granted alternate sec
tions of land along the lines of their rail
road, and it was further provided that
where a settler had already settled upon
or entered at the Land Office any quarter
section which was included within that
grant made to the lailroad and which
therefore conflicted with it, the settler
was not to be disturbed in his possession,
but the railroad was given the privilege
of selecting another piece of land or quar
ter section situated elsewhere as an in
demnity for the piece lost to them by
reason "of the settler's entry or occupation.
Th< se were called "indemnity giants."
The Southern and Central Pacific rail
roads as well as other land grant roads
immediately selected great numbers of
quarter sections in lieu of and in indemni
ty for those lost through the settlers.
They failed to specify them, tract for
tract, and this gave rise to no end of con
fusion in the Land Office. The Secretary
of the Interior was desirous that the
company should tile in the Land Ofii'
tries in detail, as, for instance, "The
Southern Pacific selects the following
named quarter section as indemnity for
that quarter section within the original
grant to the railroad, but which was lost
by reason of the occupation of John
Smith." Instead of ihus specifying their
indemnity selections tract for tract they
continued to ignore the requirements of
the Land Office and merely "bunched"
their selections.
Finally Secretary of the Interior Noble
issued a peremptory notice to the rail
roads that unless they met the require
ments their indemnity selections would
be canceled as fast as the work of the
Land Office proceeded. This threw the
railroad people into a panic. The vice
president and general attorney of the
Southern Pacific Railroad entered into
correspondence with Francis ML Gideon,
then a clerk in the railroad division of
the Land Office, through an intermediary,
David A. Chambers, who is in the regu
lar employ of Huntington here, and the
result was that Gideon made a trip to the
Mills building. New York, where after an
interview with the railroad officials, he
was induced to resign his employment in
the Land Office and work for the rail
road in making these corrections. It was
suspected that Gideon, who performed
the work in an outside office on P street,
had been allowed by Commissioner of the
Land Office Stone to remove from the
Land Office the papers and books which
properly belong there, and that Gideon,
by reason of this favoritism, was enabli d
to rapidly complete his labors, for Gid
eon was one day observed at work on
leaves which had been taken from Land
Office records.
It was suspected, too, that Gideon em
ployed clerks in the Land Office to help
him, and that this was done with the
knowledge of Commissioner Stone. One
clerk named Nevin acknowledged that
he had been paid by Gideon to assist him,
but complained because he had not re
ceived the full amount promised him.
Commissioner Stone's own son was also
offered employment and received money
from Gideon. But he. too, complained
that he had not received as his reward
the whole amount promised him by Gid
eon, and he was foolish enough to com
plain in public, thereby implicating his
father, Commissioner Stone, it was ob
vious that young Stone had been em
ployed by Gideon merely for the purpose
of gaining the good will if not the active
aid of Commissioner Stone himself.
Certain it is that Huntington was well
pleased with the work performed by the
Land Office in approving hundreds of
thousands of indemnity selections and is
suing patents therefor to his railroad,
for he called on Commissioner Stone in
person and thanked him for his Industry.
Commissioner Stone was, it seems, heav
ily involved financially at that time. Mr.
Huntington not only thanked Commis
sioner Stone, but inquired: "Governor,
what are your necessities?" and thereup
on promised to hand and did th< reafter
cause to be handed to Commissioner
Stone some $1300. But the Commissioner
had been promised $2500 by Mr. Ilunttng
ton. not as a bribe, of courseâ for Gov
ernor Stone's character had always been
unimpeachableâ but merely "to relieve
his necessities." But, according to young
Stone, his father never received the total
amount of $2500. He was only handed
$1500.
These facts are susceptible of proof,
and this proof can be furnished if neces
sary. The above is related merely to
show Huntington's methods in Washing
ton. That he has either directly or by in
direction influenced the votes of mem
bers of Congress is not doubted where his
methods are well known.
CONVICTED OF IMITATING
THE CASTORIA LABEL
ST. LOUIS. Mo., May 15.â Samuel Es
linger, charged with imitating a labeTNof
the Centaur Company of New York, was
adjudged guilty and a fine of $230 imposed
in the Court of Criminal Correction this
afternoon. It was charged that Eslinger
in the manufacture of a preparation of
Castoria had imitated that of the Charles
H. Fletcher brand, manufactured by the
Centaur Company. Judge Clark, being a
personal friend of Mr. Eslinger, asked
Judge Hirzel of Clayton to occupy the
bench during the trial. Eslinger did not
eÂ»acÂ«y duplicate the Fletcher brand of
Castoria, but the similarity was sufficient
to convict him. He will "have to go to
jail if the fine Is not paid. The" Centaur
company will continue the prosecution of
imitators of their pooda in the criminal
courts. This was the Brat case. It ends
tne litigation in St. Louis over the imita
tion ..f" the Charles H. Fletcher brand of
Castoria by Eslinger, the Centaur Com
pany winning in both the civil and crimi
nal courts.

SLEEP IS NATURE'S
GREAT RESTORER.
! Disturbed Sleep Is an Indica-
tion That Your Nerves

! WEAKENED NERVES LEAD TO
VERY SERIOUS AFFLICTIONS.
Sleeplessness Is an evil fraught with great
1 danger, for if prolonged it may overthrow the
reason, or produce apoplexy. The must fre-
q uent cause is weakened nerves.
There are many conditions thai result in a
weakening or injury to the nervous system,

walks of fife are liable i" nervous decline.
Sleeplessness is one of the early symptoms of
! nervous prostration, it is a warning that seri-
ous disease is Impending. We cannot do with-
out refreshing sleep it is most necessary to
life. When one does not get the requisite
amount of sleep the vital energies fail to re-
cuperate, the forces are gradually expended,
the bodily strength decreases. Extreme ner-
vousness and headaches result, the memory
becomes clouded and many other symptoms en-
sue.
The surest way to overcome sleeplessness ana
i the many other symptoms due to weakened
nerves is to strengthen the nervous system.

Buffalo Situation Not

Special Dispatch to The C I
P.rFFALO, N. V . May 16. -The dock
situation is worse to-night than at any
time since the opening of the season.
The monthly menâ the men who work
inside of the elevators â are out. and
hav^ agreed to remain out until the
grain shovelers' and the freight hand
lers' strikes are settled. To-morrow
every elevator here wi'l be idle, unless
new men can be engaged to take the
places of the monthly men, which is
said to be improbable.
Bishop Quigley and the loaders of the
grain shovelers held a conference to
day, and it lasted until 9 o'clock to
night. The grain shovelers claimed that
.Mr. Connors had violated all the es
sential provisions of the agrement that
the Lake Carriers' Association had
made with the union. Thr- BishOD af
terward addressed a big meeting of the
grain shovelers. He told them that, in
view of the course adopted by the <-on
tractor, he would not advise them to re
turn to work. It had been derided, he
said, that the only way to win a vic
tory that would have any material re

ployed on the docks. Including grain
Bhovelers, monthly men, freight hand
lers, coal passers or handlers, and

tractor Connors agreed to employ none
but members of the new (Jrain Shov

agreed to. Bishop Quigley said the Car
riers' Association would also be asked
to abrogate the contract.
No settlement of the difficulty will
be reached now until all the boss scoop

MARGARET MANNING
GETS THE PROPERTY
Judge Angellotti Decides the Late
Andrew Manning's Will
Is Valid.
SAX RAFAEL, May 1."..â 1n the
brated Manning case Judge Angellotti
handed down his decision to-day in favor
of ti). defendant, Margaret .Manning, and
thus disposed fif a le^ul dispute the vari
ous phasi s of which have been replete
with spicy incident-.
.1. J. Manning brought suit in the Su
â  I'ourt against 'iis sister, Margaret,
a handsome i.ionde of the statuesque
type, employi d as forewoman in a San
Francisco cloak house, to have a deed to
property valued ai $10,000, executed In her
favor by the father, Andrew Manning, of
Tomales, shortly before his death de
: a deed of trust for the eight chil
drÂ« ii.
It was during the Trial of the case that
Coroner E, E. Hill and Dr. Dunn cre
ated a sensation, the first by swearing
that Dr. Buckley never compounded a
prescription In which bromide of sodium
did not form an Ingredient; the second by
his testimony that Dr. Buckley was
deemed a taker by the medical fraternity.
On one occasion during the taking of the
deposition Miss Manning threatened to
horsewhip J. W. Keyes, attorney (or the
prom cution.
Judge Angellotti merely says in his de
cision that the charges of insanity and
undue Influence are not proved, without
the mention of any names he says that
out #f nineteen witnesses only one ttsti
fled that Andrew Manning was insane
'!"hat witness was Dr. Buckley. It is un
derstood that Attorneys Keyes and Allen
will appeal the case to the Supreme
Court.

Jugular vein, but struck too high.
Apain he made a slash at Snower-'
throat, but did not strike deep enough
to eul the vital organ.
As Showers attempted to rise Putt
man closed with him and stabbed him
twice, 6nce in the left armpit and again
in the breast, striking the base if" the
heart. Then he ran toward th-' upper
end '>;' the prison, but was Intercepted
by Assistant Turnkey Cassidy md dis
armed. He still carried the bloody
knife in his hand and his clothofl WÂ« re
splashed with blood. When questioned
he burst into team, but would pay noth
ing except cry out: "Oh, my boy! My
boy!"
This exclamation was taken to refer
to Abe Majors, now under sentenci of
d.-ath at William City. T'tah, for the
murder of Police Captain Bruwn at Oa
d< n.
Majors was paroled from Folsom
Prison on December i's, is9S, and in n
short time violated his parole and be
gan a career of highway robbery m
company with his brother Archie, who
was killed at the same time Abe mur
dered Captain Brown. While in Folsom
Majors was the inseparable companion
of Puttman.
When the nÂ«wg came that Majors
was likely to be hanged in Itah, Putt
man began crying and taking on about
his fate. There never had been any
difficulty between Puttman and Show
ers, but sixteen years ago Showers, in
company with Lloyd Majors and a man
named Jewell, murdered two men
named Renowden ami Mclntyre mar
Los Gatos, in Santa Clara County. At
the trial Showers turned State's evi
dence, and upon his testimony Majors
and Jewell were convicted and both
hanged. Showers was given a life sen
tence in Polsom Prison. Lloyd Majors
was the father of Abe and Archie Ma
jors. It was because of his testifying
against Lloyd Majors that Puttman
conceived a murderous hatred against
him.
Showers was a model prisoner. Since
his arrival here in 1883, he has never
been punished or reprimanded and was
one <>f the hardest-working prisoners in
Folsorn. He had earned the good will
of all the officers and all the better
class of convicts. It was not known
until to-day that he had an enemy
among them.
On the other hand, Puttman has been
an incorrigible disturber and agitator.
He was sent here December 4, 1595, from
San Francisco, for a term of ten years.
He had served a previous term In the
San Francisco County Jail on a charge
reduced from felony because of his
youth. He is only 25 years of age now.'
Since his incarceration here he has con
tinually been in trouble with officers
and other convicts. He has been pun
ished eleven times, three times for as
saulting other prisoners and once for
threatening a guard. In July, 1897, he
was one of the leaders of a gang that
attempted to incite a strike among the
convicts here, in imitation of the strike
at San Quentin.
Showers, just before he died, said
that Puttman stabbed him because of
Majors' "kid." After Puttman was
locked up he clumsily simulated insan
ity. He cried out that he did not know
what was the matter or why he waa
locked Up.
The murder of Showers is regarded by
prison officials as one of the direct out
comes of the miscarriage of justice in
the Oppenhelmer cast-. Oppenheimer,
who was once a San Francisco messen
ger boy. murdered a prisoner named
Koss in the Folsom Prison last year,
under almost Identically the same cir
cumstances. His neck was saved by a
gang of fellow toughs swearing him out
of it. It is supposed that Puttman has
a gang already staked out to testify in
his behalf. He belongs to the same gang
that Oppenheimer did.
The murder bears every evidence of
having been a carefully planned assas
sination.

SIGNIFICANCE OF
AMERICAN PARTICIPATION
ROME, May 15. -Ex-Prime Minister
Crispi has contributed a noteworthy
article on the peace conference to the
Nuovia Antologia. He says he consid
ers the invitation to the (Jolted States
to participate in the conference a fact
of thf first importance, especially as
South American States are not Invited.
The appearance of North America in
the councils of Europe is a precedent
which will be followed by the interven
tion of the United States in all Euro
pean questions.
The chief interest in the article cen
ters in the record of a conversation the
writer had with M. Gambetta in Paris,
August 30, 1877. Gambetta then feared
a coup d'etat, and Signor Crispi re
marked to him that the army and
clergy constituted dangers for the re
public. M. Gambetta agreed, and de
clared the only remedy would be uni
versal disarmament. As Signor CilspJ
was about to visit Prince Bismarck at
Gastern, M. Gambetta commissioned
him to discuss the delicate Question of
disarmament with the Chancellor. The
latter declared disarmament was pra -
tically impossible. He added: "Words
have not yet been found to express the
limits of armament or disarmament.
Military Institutions vary in each coun
try, and when you have put all your
armies on a peace footing you will nut
be able to say different motions are in
equal conditions for defense and of
fense. Let us leave the matter to peace
societies."
Signor Crispi's ronclusion is scarcely
more optimistic than was Prince Bis
marck's. The conference at The Hague,
he writes, avoids but does not eliminate
reasons fur a quarrel, and neglects
without destroying the germs of war
and revolution. Wars and revolutions
may be delayed, but will burst forth
whenever nations think lit. Europe has
but one way of lasting safely, namely,
the substitution of united states for di
vided states. Thus alone can centuries
of rancor, animosity, envy and preju
dice be canceled by sisterly work and
civil progress fraught with happiness
for the race, which has hitherto been
poisoned by barbarous lust of conquest.
ARCHBISHOP IRELAND
FAVORS DISARMAMENT
NEW YORK, May 16.â A cable to the
Journal from Paris says: Archbishop
Ireland gave the following statement to
the Journal correspondent to-day in an
swer to a reauest for his views on the
coming peace conference:
"All civilized nations favor the under
lying principles of The Hague confer
ence. All Intelligent men recognize that
Internationa] differences should be set
tled upon an intellectual basis, whenever
possible. While I cannot anticipate the
work of the delegates and while it would
ill become me to offer suggestions to such
a distinguished intellectual body. 1 am
free to say that there is no other work
so well calculated to bring happiness to
nil nations as that with which they are
confronted.
"The piling up of huge armies is the
bane of Europe. Most countries have
reached a straining point in this respect,
and unless a remedy be applied speedily,
irretrievable ruin stares them in the face.
Civilization and Christianity are concur
rent forces which could and should be
made to stop the spectacle of nations
aiming themselves to the teeth for the
purpose of destroying one another.
"Hind, | am not an advocate of peace
at any price. There are times when war
is unavoidable. Occasions may even
arise when war is as lawful as righteous,
as holy as any of the wars of the cru
sades. When I was in Rome I found
everybody in favor of pence."

SHORTRIDGE AND
BILLS CLASH
Pyrotschnics in Court
at San Jose.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, May 15.â The suit of Cap
tain W. A. Nevills against Samuel M.
and Charles M. Shortridge to recover
$30,000 due on two promissory notes
was up before Judge Lorigan to-day.
It was decided in favor of the Messrs.
Shortridge. on the ground that it was
prematurely brought.
Senator Charles M. Shortridge and
Captain Nevills clashed in Judge Lori
gan's court during the trial this after
noon, and possible bloodshed was avert
ed only by the summoning of a bailiff
to restore order. Shortridge was lined
550 or two days' imprisonment in jail
for applying vile epithets to the million
aire miner, and paid the fine. Nevills
made a motion as if to draw a revolver,
and when he attempted to arise from
his chair Attorneys Keardon and Camp
bell caught hold of him.
The sensation of the day came with
the appearance of Senator Shortridge
on the witness stand. Attorney Rear
don inquired of the witness if at an
interview in his office he (Reardon) had
agreed to extend the time of the notes
one year if Shortridge would let his
furniture and library in at $5000 instead
of $7000.
"Yes, I let that rob me of $20,000,"
replied Shortridge, pointing at Nevills.
Nevills reached under his coat as if
for a revolver and started to arise from
his chair. His attorneys grabbed him.
Shortrldge glared at Nevills and applied
another epithet.
Judge iiorigan then took a hand. He
upbraided the Senator for having used
indecent language and lined him $50 for
contempt, with the alternative of two
days in jail. Later the Judge cut off the
alternative and Shortridge paid the
fine. After court adjourned Senator
Shortridge said he was willing to pay
550 for a chance to express his opinion
of Nevills.
Shortridge and Nevills met on the
courthouse steps this morning and a
clash was then narrowly averted.
On November 30, 1896, the Shortridge
brothers borrowed $60,000 from Nevills
on two promissory notes, giving as se
curity a house and lot on Washington
street. San Francisco, some land in
Arizona and property in this county.
The notes were payable one year after
date, but interest or principal came
not. Nevills and Samuel Shortridge
had a falling out later, and the former
demanded his money. When about to
bring foreclosure proceedings the
Messrs. Shortrldge turned over the
property as part payment on principal,
and they were given a year's further
time on thebalance. Now Nevills wants
a settlement. The Messrs. Shortrldge
were credited with a payment of $31,672
on the principal on April 30 last by the
turning over of the property. After
ward Nevills secured Charles M. Short
ridge's furniture and allowed a further
credit of $7000.
Nevills .claims these credits applied
to both dotes. The Shortridges deny
this. In answer they set forth that the
$20,000 note has been paid and that the
credits applied on the $40,000 note only.
Furthermore, they presented a counter
claim of $15,000 against Nevills for
counsel services rendered by S. M.
Shortrldge, and asked for a dismissal of
the suit and a judgment against their
erstwhile friend.
Samuel M. Shortridge was on the
stand the most of the day. At times
he waxed wroth. He denounced Nev
ills as a "malicious, wanton and vicious
man, who had sought to ruin his broth
er and himself."

VAIN SEARCH FOR
HILLARY STARR
Still No Trace of the
Missing Man.
Special Dtepetcti to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. May 15.â The mys
tery surrounding the sudden disappear
ance of Hillary S. Starr, the young
superintendent of the Oak Knoll ranch,
near Pasadena, three weeks ago re
mains unsolved. While the family of
Starr has not blocked the investigation
it is well known that its reticence and
exasperating apathy have prevented
much information coming to the sur
face that could have been utilized by
the friends who volunteered aid and
took a l ersonal interest in the search
for the absent man. From Detective
A. Gard, who has been employed upon
the case, it was learned to-day that
Starr some years ago. while residing
in Colorado, suddenly left home ;ind
wÂ«s absent for an extended period, but
he did not surround his disappearance
then with sensational features. He re
turned voluntarily but refused to give
an explanation for his absence or to tell
where he had secreted himself.
The Starr family, since the shock of
the husband's leaving has passed, is !
lain ring under the impression that the l
missing man will return. This is
heightened by the information from all
recruiting stations that no one answer
ing Starr's 'description has applied for j
enlistment in the army, and by the fact j
that while offers of reward have sent
scores of men in quest of the missing
man no clew has been found that would
lead to the belief that he had been dealt
with foully.

LIVELY EIGHT ON
DEAD MAN'S ISLE
Workmen Driven Off by
Police.
I l>iFpatoh tv The Call
VANCOUVER, H. C. May 15.â The
Htru:ri:l>' for the possession of the alleged
la] naval reserve known as Dead
Man's [sland, betwen the Chicago cap
italists, Stuart & Wells, and the pro
vincial government, culminated in ;t
fight on the Island to-day. Theodore
Ludgate, who is acting for the Chicago
men, although arrested a short time
ago at the Instance of the city, took
over sixty men before daybreak this
morning and commenced to fell all the
magnificent timber on the island. He
(red a message last night from the
Federal Government, which had grant
ed him a lease of the island, giving him
1 permission to go ahead with the work
ol erecting an immense sawmill.
The men had been at work at. out two
hours when all the provincial police
men in the city and a squad of city
policemen landed. They were accom
panied by Attorney General Martin,
Major Garden and Magistrate Ander
son. Ludgate was told to stop work
at once. He said:
"1 am empowered by the Dominion
Government to go ahead and I defy
\ ou to stop me."
The Attorney General then ordered
his arrest. Ludgate. who is a young
: Hercules, standing six fVet three, coolly
Folded his arms and waited for the ap
proach of Officer Campbell. The latter
advanced with a pair or handcuffs, but
in a trice was thrown on his back by
the mm l.ian. lit- called loudly for the
city police to help him. Several re
sponded and a desperate hand-to-hand
encounter ensued. Ludgate was thrown
to the ground and badly cut about the
face. Captain rates, who is working
with him, called upon th.- nun em
ployed in clearing the Island to as
sist their leader.
In groups of five and six the men
hurried to the Bpot, armed with axes.
j'irks and shovels. While Lutlc.it!',
bleeding and covered with mud. strug
gled with the officers, Magistrate An
derson mounted a slump and as the
sixty employes were ai"'ut to make an
attack on the Government officials and
police officers he read the riot act.
"Say the wurd. captain." said the men
to Ludgate, who was by this time hand
cuffed, "and well throw the officers
Into the st-a."
"Mi-n. I don't want to see any blood
shed." replied Ludgate. "We will have
to give in to the law this time.
The Attorney General then addr
j the infuriated workmen and said if
they did not leave the island in thirty
minutes he would order them shut
down. The men hold a hurried confer
ence and finally decided to leave. Lud
gate was driven to the city. Becurely
Ironed, with two policemen guarding
him. When he reached here he was
surrounded by a large crowd of promi
nent citizens, who offered him every
support in his fight. This afternoon
Ludgate was brought before Magistrate
Anderson on a charge of unlawfully
cutting timber on crown lands. The
case was adjourned uptil Thursday.
A serious oonflict is now imminent
Viet ween the Dominion and Provincial
governments. That the imperial Gov
ernment also is taking a hand in the
matter is evidenced by the fact that
the warship Egeria arrived in port
In response to a hurried message this
afternoon, and is now anchored off the
island. Ludgate is free again, and it
is reported to-night he will land 150
men on the island early in the morn
ing.
SHOUP SAYS QUAY
WILL BE SEATED
Appointees From Other States, He
Thinks. Will Also Be Admitted
to the Senate.
BOISE. Idaho. May 15.â Senator Shoup
returned from Lemhi County to-day. He
| was asked what his altitude was respect
ing the seating of Senator Quay on the
â  Governor's appointment. He said he was
not prepared to announce what he would
do, but it was his opinion that Quay
! would be seated. He based his opinion on
the fact that in the Mantle contest the
Republicans largely voted for seating the
applicant. He did not know how the new
' men felt, but it was his opinion that the
large Republican majority would be suf
ficient to carry Senator Quay in if the
; vote remained divided anywhere near the
same as before. The Corbett case, he said,
was not a criterion, as the surrounding
conditions were much different.
The s-f-iitiiiff of Quay, he said, would
carry with it the yeatir.p; of appol
from other States. The Senator voted for
Mantle and the others that year whose
hinged on the Mantle decision.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. May 15â
Dr. Jordan has long had the Idea of mak
ing those departments which interest the
men of the University as strong as possi
ble. A short time ago the law depart

dent at Johns Hopkins and Harvard Uni
versities, taking the degree of A. M. at
Harvard. After leaving Harvard he
taught English for two years, one year
as instructor and one as acting profes
sor, in Lake Forest University. From
Lake Forest he went to the headship of,
the English department in. the South Side
High School at Milwaukee, where he
still Is. .--.-> .
Mr. Huntington took high rank as a
student and has been a successful teach
er. He has been for some years a con
tributor to various magazines and period
icals, and is the editor of some texts of
English poets published for school use.

I. Huntingdon back down to a certain

I In the Morning Press to-morrow:
sax FRANCISCO, May 11, iw.
Mr. Edward Ivison, Santa Barbara-
Pear Sir: Yours of the 10th, with news
paper clippings inclosed, is received, for
j which you have my thanks. I think you
In Santa Barbara and those living along
the line of the road know as well as we
do what is required, and. as I wrote you
[ before. I would like to have the right of
way cleared up as soon as it well can be.
1 will endeavor, and l think I could get
my co-associates to pay something
toward the accomplishment of this
end. but I would like to know just
what it will cost to g-et the free right
of way bo that we could cover the gap
with workmen. I have given orders to
the contractors not to put on any greater
force until this matter is settled, and of
I course we shall jrive a reasonable time
! for this right of way matter to be cleared
up. It is quite true that we did not agree
to build the road until all the rights of
way had been furnished, and we are,
therefore, in a sense technically blame
less, having dime what we agreed t" do.
At the same time I do not feel satisfied
with what we have done, thinking that
we have come a little short ourselves of
doing the best we knew how toward
I building this road, and bo I shall speak
with in >â¢ people and get them if I can to
agree to pay a part of the expense of
clearing up thosi' rights of way, only we
must know just what the expense will be
and know as soon as the information can
be given us. We cannot wait very long
for it. and we cannoi afford to push the
work ahead until the question of rights
of way is entirelj cleared up and closed.
I hope i: will be done promptly. Yours
truly. C. P. HUNTINGTON.

SUCCESS BY THE

alleria Rusticana."
"ORPHEUS" AT THE TIVOLI
BRACE OF GOOD VARIETY ACTS
AND A BAD ONE.
The Held-Over Farces Continue in
Popular Favor at the
Columbia and
Alcazar.
Rather a weird double bill, this of
"Pinafore" and "Cavallerla Kusticana,"
but not half so unpalatable as you
would think. In fact, it sounds much
better than it looks in type, and the
good sized audience that turned into
the Grand Opera House last night re
warded the efforts of the Southwell
company with many premeditated bou
quets and, what was better still, much
spontaneous applause. That this clever
company would make easy work. of
"Pinafore" was a foregone conclusion,
but there was a deal of speculation as
to the outcon f "Cavallerla," the first
serious opera of the Southwell season.
And be it said at once to the credit of
all concerned that the Mascagni pro
duction was distinctly admirable. The
choruses were alert and vigorous and
they .sang richly and in tune; the or
chestra, under Mr. Simonson, was in
sympathy with the tense, sultry spirit
of the score; the stage pictures and
stage direction wÂ«Â»re competently ar
ranged, and two of the five principals
scored signal victories. These were

Miss Mason and Mr. Persse. She di
vulged unheralded dramaisms that
were nothing short of a sensation in
the strenuous role of Santuzza; her
singing was even and pure and she
brought out a great deal of the pas
sionate color of the part. Mr. Persse,
I too, separated himself effectively from
| his comic opera personality and gave
Turridu with convincing vehemence. His
voice, so delicately tender in the lighter
operas, finds a surprisingly congenial
vent in the excitement of this one. Hat
tie Bell Ladd played Lola with a cer
: tain Carmenesque flavor that was not
! out of keeping, and Bertha Ricci was
lan uneventful Lucia. Most Lucias are.
! A somewhat stuffed Alfio was Mr. Goff ;
I but all in all the performance deserved
its flowers and applause.
In "Pinafore," which came first, the
; staging was copious and good and the
; ensembles notably free and strong. All
the satire that is in Gilbert's libretto
' was not squeezed out, but the acting
I was, on the whole, much better than we
: are accustomed to in local productions
; of this musical comedy. Mr. Wolff was
'â  fully as good a Dick Deadeye as I can
I recall, and he sang the part as I never
remember to have heard it sung by
any one else. Mr. Wooley presented the
ruler of the Queen's navee with a fas
tidious elegance that was very tit. and
gave an attractive characterization
throughout, although he did not con
trive to get quite the best humor out
of his lyrics. Daisy Thome was the
proud, glacial Josephine in just that
way, arid Winifred Goff was fairly
pompous as the captain. Little Buttor
cup was an amiable phase of Miss
Ricci, and Miro Delamotta made a good
ligure of Ralph Kaekstraw and Bang
with urgent charm in all but the top
notes of his voice.
The more I think it over the more I
like this eccentric double bill. It is not
as hearty a feast as when the "Pagli
j acci" is Siamized with the "Cavallerla,"
but that is rather an advantage these
vaudeville days.

Orpheum.
Three new turns at the Orpheumâ two
successes and one failure. The former are
contributed by the Montrose troupe of
acrobats and th* 1 Escamillos. equilibrists;
the latter by Miss Edna Aug. who is
j gently billed as "America's leading char
acter comedienne." According to report,
Miss Aug is under contract to play next
J season with Augustin Daly's company.
i If this be true, Mr. Daly has his life's
i work ahead of him. Miss Aug at present
shows the smallest amount of talent and
training that may be exposed with safety
on the stage. Her imitations of Anna
Held, a Bowery girl, a Dutch dialectriclan
and a "coon" songstress are the most
dismal in the history of the Orpheum.
Some things on the stage are so bad that
they are funny. This act is worse than
that. The Montrosesâ five men and a boy

The Recent Decisions in the Race j
Track and Slot Machine Cases
Are the Cause of the
Trouble.
Trip discredit brought upon the Police
Courts through -the decisions of Acting
Police Judge Groeslnger in the racetrack
. and nickel-in-the-slot machine cases has
* ed up Judges Graham and Megan to
definite action.
Yesterday Judge Graham, as presiding
Judge, called upon Judge Mogan and
asked him if he would be willing that all
SceQes ar)d Characters at the Aqquol Police "Old

b should be assigned to Departments
which would put an end to any
a being assigned to Groezinger until
Judj a oil had sufficiently recov

Mogan expressed his willingness to take

to h at nights so as to get

Judge Graham thereupon called upon
chief Lees and notified the Chief to in
s tru - aid to assign no

consulted with th< Bergeant, and came to
the conclusion that he could take no such
an order to that effect was
in^de in 'ipen court and spread upon the
minutes, and no action will be taken until
that Is done.
The two Judges will probably sit in
bank to-day and formally make the or

Judge Treadwell. begging him to return
to duty as soon as possible and agreeing
If necessary to bear the expense of a

.!udge Graham said tnat as far as he
was concerned he would not bear the
irflium cast upon the courts by Groezln
decisions and he was determined to
put a stop to it. Like Judge Mogan. he
would willingly hold court at nights to
â¢ his calendar till Judge Treadwell r
-d to duty. Ihe Judge had 'eft the
hall before Chief Lees decided that he
must have a written order.
Acting Judge Groezinger said later that

the other Judges would take over the
cases on his calendar. He had no desire

AN "OLD HOSS"
SALE THAT DID
NOT MAKE GOOD
Slim Pickings for the
Pubiic.
AFTER THE POLICE, NIT
OFFICIAL CLEAN-UP FOR xHE
CITY TREASURY.
Bidders Were Shy of the Specious-
Looking Packages and
Competition Was Not
Thought Of.
The annual "old hoss" sale of the Police
Department was conducted yesterday at
ms if !â :. B. Spear & Co.,
:m Sutter street. It attracted a crowd
noticeable for Its discrimination
than for its artistic qualities. This was
by reason of the fact that there was a
ling of "bunk" in the air. By
â bunk" the initiate meant bunko, and j
they realized that, when it was handed
to them by the Police Department, there
was no rebate.
In consequence, when Auctioneer
Arthur Spear announced that he was not
taking any "mahulah" money the bidders
who had got closest up experienced pangs
like the ungodly, but resigned themselves
to the inevitable in the hope of doing the
greatest good.
There were a thousand lots that had
passed through the hands of the police
during the year, and still there were in
dividuals credulous enough in the crowd
to believe that a good chronometer or a
first-water diamond had been overlooked.
"A combine against in'-." said the auc
r. as he started off the first I-; .
"Don't let me catch you at It. He dhin t.
and maybe he didn't want to. They had
gathered around him closely and tnere
wasn't the flash of a stone or the glimmer
patch case that escaped them, no
bid ol less than two bits was accepted,
and no bid was made unless more than
two bits profit was in sight.
\r times, of course, the clever auctlon
o worked upon the cupidity ol m*
ii <â  that some member of it would
ree or four dollars for a watch case
nl nf works. The laugh, bpwÂ«ver,
was always on the victim, who, in each
event, was a shrewd manipulator that
took bis medicine like a soldier and j
â¢â  : the next opportunity.
At this particular "old boss' sale that
opportunity never came. By the time the j
auctioi r and his helpers had gone
through the lot, which was well into the
day, the "wise" crowd had come to the
conclusion that the bargains were few
and far between. Clean through the lot i
t!i<r. was nothing offered worth the can- j
die. Watches without faces, purses with
out filling, chains that were mockeries !
of brass, pawn tickets thai were only in
ducements to suicide or worse, were
passed before the faces of the credulous
throng. Some bit and some did not. and
out of the whole performance the City
and County Treasury realized less than
a thousand dollars. Both sides were bit
and neither Hide was satisfied. The sale :
was a holiow mockery, also a sham.

on Fourth street, near Minna, is in a pre
carious condition at the Receiving Hos- |

Flynn and W. H. Frietts.
Flynn and Frietts were amusing them
: clv. s about 5 o'clock in the morning by
tearing down barbers' signs and other
freaks. When they reached the restau
rant they began to throw around some,
milk cans that were on the sidewalk, and
Gillick came out and remonstrated with
them. They knocked him down and his
bead struck against the curbstone. He
was taken to the hospital, where he
vomited blood, and besides being in
ternally injured it is thought that his
skull is fractured.
Flynn and Frietts were arrested by Po

A HOLD, BAD ROBBER.
Fred Meyers Arrested Sunday Night
and Held to Answer Yesterday.
Fred Meyers is a bold, bad young man,
and swift justice was meted out to him
yesterday morning by Jjdge Graham. He
was arrested Sunday night in the Cafe
Royal, where he had been in the habit of
placing poker.
He was accused of robbery. According
to the evidence in court he went to the
saloon of Fred Wolfe, 32 Fourth street,
last Friday night and told Wolfe a pitiful
story of being hard up. Wolfe treated
him to two or three drinks, and, as he
said he was perishing from hunger, Wolfe
put on his coat and asked him to accom
pany him to a restaurant to partake of a
meal.
No sooner had Wolfe stepped outside
the saloon than Meyers forcibly put his
elbow under his chin and choked him, at
the same time relieving him of his gold
watch and chain. Then he threw Wolfe
to the sidewalk and disappeared. Wolfe
notified trie police, and Sunday night
Meyers was found in the Cafe Royai.
Judge Graham held him to answer before
the Superior Court and fixed his bonds in
$3000.

DR. GALLWEY IMPROVING.
Will Take a Long Rest on the Ad
vice of His Physicians.
Dr. John Gallwey has almost entirely
recovered from his serious illness. Yes
terday he took a short ride through the
park and returned considerably re
freshed. Upon the advice of his physi
cians he will not at present engage In
professional duties. Dr. Gailwey was
very anxious to go down to his office and
get in harness again, but he concluded to
adopt the advice of Drs. Dodge, Hutchfns
and others who have been attending him
and will go to the country to-morrow
with Mrs. Gallwey and allow the "rest
cure" to operate in his case. His profes
sional engagements will be, fulfilled by
Drs. Morrissey and Hart during his ab
sence. ....â¢â 
Dr. Gallwey's sickness is ascribed to
the fact that for over eight months he
acted as Health Officer in place of Dr. A.
I. O'Brien, who went to Manila. Besides
performing the duties of that office he at
tended to his private practice with the
same energy that has always character
ized him. The consequence was that his
constitution was â  unable to stand the
double strain and he was compelled- to
succumb.

VERY LOOSE IT
150 TO 1 ODDS
Unexpected Win of a
Rank Outsider.
DREARY SPOR". AT OAKLAND
MAY W SHOWS A RETURN OF
HER OLD FORM.
Two First Choices Led Their Fields
Outâ Con Dalton First at
Juicy Odds â Romany
a Winner.
Thr Scot, a two-year-old, owned by J.
Hutchison, caused a ripple of excitement
at Oakland track yesterday by winning
at odds of 150 to 1. Neither the youngster's
owner nor the public thought he had a
chance, and his victory was welcomed by
the books. The distance was live fur
longs, and after leading almost from the
fir3t jump the two-year-old finished the
distance out in 1:02 flat, a very fair per
formance. Giga, the second choice, took
the place, while the favorite, Jennie
Riley, was not in the money.
Of the six favorites sent to the post but
two were returned winners. The sport
was dull and uninteresting.
Semper Leon, trained and owned by
Jimmy Coffey, was the warm one in the
opening scramble for maidens. Sent to
the post favorite, the gelding showed
some speed, but was unplaced at the end.
Panimint, the second choice, ridden by
Jenkins, won all the way, beating Pom
pino a length, ridden out.
Dr. Rowell's Mack gelding, Con Dalton,
furnished the surprise in the third event,
a mile selling run. Practically running
loose at odds of 15 to 1, Macklin had him
in front when half the route had been
traveled, and driving hard at the end
downed Jennie Reed over a length. The
favorite, Rey Hooker, was away poorly,
never appearing to have a chance.
Cnrrigan's Alaria captured the six fur
long dash next decided. The mare went
to the post a 7 to 10 favorite and, leading
from the start, disposed of Highland Ball
at the wire in a mild drive. Peixotto,
lacking in speed, ran an indiffefent third.
A sprint over the Futurity course fol
lowed, which was annexed by Romany,
backed from 6 to 4. Macklin had the
mount, and, outriding Amei on Solstice
the last part, won by a length. Anchored
was third.
The concluding number, a mile and a
sixteenth run. went to the favorite, May
W Three to flvewas laid against the mare,
rind after cutting out the running she dis
posed of Olinthus quite handily at the
wire in 1:47%.

Jenkins and Macklin divided the riding
honors, each piloting two winners.
Some members of the Haraorer Wield
ers 1 Association started the rumor a day
or so ago around the track that the Den
ver meeting had been declared off. The
report was entirely unfounded, as Secre
tary Roberts of the Overland Racing Club
states that Denver looks forward to the
coming meeting in June as promising to
be the greatest ever held In that city.

May Build on Blythe Property.
The story that a magnificent modern
building will soon grace the Blythe prop
erty on Kearny, Geary and Market
streets has been revived again. It is ap
parently founded on the prospective visit
of John A. McCall, president of the New
â¢â  York Insurance Company, who is credited
with being the most likely purchaser.
Charles Newman, who has an extended
lease on a portion of the required prop
! erty has apparently the key to the situa
-1 tion. A building cannot be erected until
j terms are made with him. Inquiry at the
1 office of Mrs. Florence Blythe-Hinklcy
elicited the information that the title to
the property is still vested in her name.

THE HEAVENLY TWINS.
THE nearest approach to a classical immortality
that Governor Gage and Daniel M. Burns will
ever make is conveyed by the ironical use of the
phrase, "par nohile fratrum," or "a noble pair of
brothers." Their intimacy is as close, if not as pure,
as that of Jonathan and David. It is quite likely that
they will be as inseparable hereafter as they are now.
The State is filled with narratives of their relations to
each other, which unite them as intimately as the
Siamese twins.
It may be presumed that the people can still identify
Daniel M. Burns. He cannot be remembered by any
great deed he has done, by any noble word he has
â -jH.ken, by any sound principle he has advocated or
:by any statesmanlike measure he has originated. His
achievements in petty municipal politics or in his
former official connection with the State, though oft
en threshed over in the press, were not in themselves
enough to rescue him from oblivion. But, as the rail
road candidate for the Senate of the United States,
without a single intellectual or moral qualification,
with a record, to use David C. Broderick's celebrated
phrase, "dripping with corruption," and in hardened
disregard of popular sentiment, he stands upon a pin
nacle of unenviable notoriety, miry and slippery, yet
distinguishable amidst the fetid exhalations of the
class of politicians with whom he is most intimately
associated.
And this is the selected adviser of the chief execu-
i tive of the State of California, who stood on a high |
during a long canvass and roared his independ- J
ence of railroad influence and of every form of hos- i
tility to the public till he became hoarse and his j
listeners stunned! He sounded his own immaculate
purity through the gamut of a bugle, with the under
tone of a trombone. A mere interrogation that even
g< sted the possible existence of a suspicion among
those who did not personally know him that his tem
perature toward C. P. Huntington was not below
i xcited in him as much indignation as the honest '
parrot felt when he admitted he could talk but
denied the right of his interlocutor to ask him if he j
wanted a cracker. The aureole through which he 1
shone as a candidate while the railroad was "out of
politics" transfigured him into the semblance of a
party saint, whom the people could proximately wor
ship while the common wirepullers glared and tore
their hair in the dista
An archangel and Sal m with locked arms would
not have been a gn I cism than the individual
fraternization after the â  the Governor that i
i? and the Senatorial candidate that was. There is no,
accounting, however, for personal tastes, which may
excite curiosity or surprise, but nevertheless belong '
to the region of undebatable privacy. So the affec
tionate blending of rancid oil and muddy water thus
personified was wonderingly observed and mutely tol
erated. But when the legislators had dispersed and
â¢ in their scattered homes in the midst of their '
relieved constituencies the plot thickened until the;
State was involved and a private anomaly became a j
public nuisance.
For it was - rent that these heavenly twins
not the mere victims of an unaccountable and an i
engrossing tenderness, but that they had an engage
ment together, with Mr. Huntington as proprietor
and William F. Herrin as manager. The Governor,
who had quickly anmasked when the railroad carnival
began and who stuck out his tongue at the duped
â  rs who had registered his victory, eagerly prom- :
to caricature Net-", who appointed a horse to a!
sulate, if the example of Pennsylvania was rati- â 
tied at Washington. Meanwhile the regards of the
clashing mercenaries were to be distributed, and who
could be so repn sentative an intermediary as his alter
I ego. or his other self?
The frequent rehearsals were over and the parts
duly memorized- Up went the curtain, gently tinkled
the prompter's bell and the open spectacular drama
began, which, like a Chinese play, is apparently in one
act and never to end. All the interested spectators
can see is rapid changes of scene, with the same crowd
tumbling over each other from one point to another. :
And. amidst the general tumult, the only fixture is the
receptive Gage and the whispering Burns.
Gage is discovered in the orange groves of the
South. Burns is there. A rapid shift is made to the
; recesses of the executive chambers in the State Capi
! tol. Burns is there. The rush of steam is heard and
â  ears in the portals of the Palace. Burns |
is there. Gage vanishes into one of the dim recesses i
c architectural hostelry. The coat tail of Burns 1
â  s from the faithful crowd. Gage reappears on the
Sacramento bank of our California Tiber. Burns is
| there. Shaded nooks, obscure corners, open porticos,
festive grill rooms. all the resorts and all the refuges of
the haunted purveyor of political viands, follow each
other in prompt though irregular procession. But
amidst all the transmutations the prompter is tin
| changed, there is otic vociferous gang, one hypno
i tized Gage, and one eternal and indescribable Burns.
The audience is numerous and respectable. It in-
eludes Republicans who will have to participate with
their means, with their influence and with their labor
in the realistic performance of the coming year. And
their chief interest now is to in whether the
worst actors they ever saw will finish their disrepu
table parts ard allow genuine stars and a pood stock
company t>> take possession of the stage.
SELF-GOVERNMENT.
THE report of General Stephen D. Leo, chairman
of the history committee, to the Confederate re
union at Charleston contains'the following sig
nificani passage.: "The reception given our benevo
lent intentions in the Philippines is certainly of a char
r to inspire a wholesome respect. We are not
; likely in the future to hear so much about the right
â  of men who have not yet learned to govern them
selves to govern others by their vote.-. The doctrine
of the Declaration of Independence, that governments
i derive their just powers from the consent of the gov
\ crned. had something of a shock in the war between
| the States, and the island subjects of the United States
| will find little comfort in reading that celebrated in
strument by the light of subsequent history. The dif
! ficulties of the race problem abroad ought to bring a
charitable judgment of the same thing here at home.
and we may reasonably expect our Northern brethren
to meet us hereafter rather in a spirit of inquiry than
of rebuke. The recent movement to put the su
premacy of the more educated upon a constitutional
and legal basis, thus banishing the .-pecter of misrule
from our borders, is steadily gaining progress."
It will be observed that this is a deliberate assertion
â of the righlness of the ethical basis of slavery. It is
difficult to disagree with the conclusions reached by
the Confederates if the premise of subject races is ad
mitted. The statement is a renewal of the academic
discussion that was brought on by Lincoln when he
said: "If a man govern himself, that is liberty, that is
self-government. But if he govern himself and an
other man. that is tyranny, that is despoti-m."
The nature of the government given to the other
man. its goodness, its benevolence, did not enter into
the question at all. The fact that it was government
without consent made it despotism. The joint state
ment of Seward and Lincoln that the republic could
THE SJ\N ri^ANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 16, 1899.
not endure half-slave and half-free, for between the
two there was an irrepressible conflict, applies with
still greater force to a republic ruling without their
consent twenty millions of "island subjects."
Men who look beyond politics to the principles of
government, which are the foundation of all politics in
a free State, will readily apply the principle of the ir
repressible conflict to a republic which governs citi
zens at home by their Consent and subjects abroad
against their consent. The meaning of General Lee's
statement. is painfully plain. It is an expression of
Confederate assent to imperialism, to the permanent
subjugation of our island suhjects, because it will
compel the same civil and political subjugation of the
negroes at home.
This deepens and darkens the problem and must
?dd to the anxieties of all who thoughtfully consider
it. It means the control presently of nearly 25.000,000
of subjects at home and abroad. No Northern im
perialist can find fault with General Lee's Confederate
repudiation of the Declaration of Independence nor
with the tone of contempt in which he refers to it.
Nor can any such resent the air of exultation with
which the Confederates hail what they properly regard
as the early triumph of the principles for which they
stood in 1861. There is a very faint trace of political
difference between a government owning "subjects"
and a master owning slaves, and there is no moral nor
ethical difference at all. The whole issue is illuminated
by its statement to the Confederates. The battles
fought abroad are for the subjugation of 13.000,000 of
blacks at home, for a constitutional change denying
to them self-government, for repudiation of the Decla
ration of Independence as an absurdity.
In this view it stands the Republican party in hand
to examine its ancient charts and see whither it is
drifting. If the premise and conclusion of the Con
federate leader are admitted the Republican party has
no further reason for existence. If it affirm the right
to hold subjects it cannot deny the right to hold
slaves, and all the terrible and glorious history it made
in the first four years of its power fades away like the
morning mist. â¢
The view of General Lee is that of General Wheeler.
Senator Morgan and the whole list of most influential
Southern leaders. They see in conquest and empire
and the owning of subjects not only a positive his
torical vindication of their position in 1861, but a
present and future advantage of the first order. It
â  makes them again masters of the negroes. It puts
their heels once more on the neck of the blacks. It
advances forever the principle that the weak have no
rights except by the will of the strong. It forever
.loses against Jefferson's doctrine that strong and
weak, high and low, all men are born equal and with
i certain inalienable rights. It overthrows finally and
destroys that protection of inherent right in which
Jefferson believed. Inalienable right disappears from
the world. None will make its fight, none respect its
expression. The weak and humbie will be born into
! the world unequal and with only such rights as the
i strong choose to give them.
Surely Mr. Moorfield Storey spoke with the voice
I of prophecy when he said in 1806 that "our form of
government and our free institutions can endure any
vicissitude and misfortune, but they will hardly sur
vive victory in a foreign war."
THE FIGHT AGAINST MILES.
lIHJROM the manner with which the report of the
court of inquiry lias been received it is evident a
strong movement has been started, seemingly by
the meat packers of Chicago, to hopelessly discredit
General Miles and force him from the army. The at
tack has been maintained continuously ever since the
report was made public and has been pushed forward
under as many forms as ingenuity can give it.
One of the most cunning of the devices to injure
the general was put forth a few days ago in a report
that "General Miles is observing the letter but not
the spirit of the obligation to accept the report of the
army beef court of inquiry as final. He still talks to
friends about a packed court, and they are quietly
working for Congressional investigation. William J.
Bryan's influence has been sought." It is said in the
same precious rumor the silver agitator was told that
by upholding Miles he could discredit the administra
tion and thus help his own party.
From this story, told with repeated assertions that
it emanates from "good authority," it would appear
the general of the nrmy is engaged in a political in
trigue against the President and the War Department,
that he has formed an alliance with the noisiest agi
tator of the country for the purpose of fomenting dis
cord and gratifying a personal spite. If such a story
should find credence among any considerable number
of people it would seriously injure the general's repu
tation, and to that extent aid the angry beef packers in
their efforts to deprive him of his rank and force him
into retirement.
Fortunately the concoctor of the report, the Wash
ington correspondent of the Chicago Inter Ocean,
was led by excess of zeal in the cause of the beef con
tractors to go too far and betray the animus of his
story. By way of making a contrast to the alleged
insubordination and intrigues of Miles, the report
says Secretary Alger is well satisfied with the situation
and will continue to do his duty as heretofore with
out fear or favor. The report then goes on to say:
Should there mmc a timo in the future when
Miles shall attempt to have the Secretary overruled
by the President, then Secretary Alger will refuse
to submit to intimidation and will maintain his
pplf-rr'srw^-t ny surrendering thr> portofolla He has
stood between tho President and enemies of the ad
ministration for many months and taken abuse that
w.-is meant for and in fact applied to the President.
Rut ho will not submit to being used as a means of
reconciling Miles and creating harmony with an In
subordinate Official. If the Provident wishes a Sec
retary ..f War who will truckle to the discredited
major general in command he will have to find an-
Other man, as 'ioneral Alger will not do so.
It will be seen the story concludes by speaking of
General Miles as a man already discredited, and holds
out the hardly veiled threat that the President must
ignore the general or Alger will resign. It is a fair
supposition that all the first part of the story about the
intrigue with Bryan was about invented solely to
make occasion for the closing passage. The fight
against the general has clearly become one of ex
traordinary bitterness, and it would be worth while
to have a Congressional investigation if for no other
purpose than that of disclosing the men who arc
backing it.
It is announced that certain prominent men in New
York arc arranging to welcome Dewey to a banquet
which will cost $100 a plate, and if they do the dinner
will not be any too good for the admiral, but at the
same time it will prove there are some millionaires in
the big city who can make even patriotism take asi
nine forms.

RANCH AND RURAL LIFE
The use of wood pulp for paper has not entirely obsoleted rag paper.
Many a housewife on a ranch has wondered what to do with old clothes
that are past wearing. Formerly the "'rag man" used to make his rounds
and trade tinware for garments that had served their time and been dis
charged as clothing. In London there is a paper mill that makes a special
kind of paper. Near by is a flat, barren piece of ground where old clothes
are buried to undergo a ground sweat in preparation for use in the paper
mill. A corner of this grave yard is set aside for old linen goods. The
linen is placed in boxes, called coffins, in layers, with finely pulverized soil
between each layer, and the coffin is then buried and limewater is sprin
kled over the grave. At the head of each grave is a wooden headstone bear
ing the date of the interment. After a fortnight the coffin is raised, the
linen is taken out, put in a warm blanket and rushed to the paper mill. This
supplementary retting produces some chemical change in the flax.
The average wheat yield in the United States is thirteen bushels and in
Europe thirty bushels per acre.

ADVICE.
Th^re was some one or other who had a quaint way
i )f merrily saying "Furgit it!"
Don't keep on bewailing your I< >t day by day.
It isn't your duty, so quit it.
There's no use complaining of how things are run.
This earth has its sorrow and likewise its fun.
If you find you can't right any mischief that's done,
"Furg-it it! Furgit it! Furgit it!"
Grim winter has lingered, but gnarly old trees
Strive for blooming and murmur "Furgit it!"
And the echo is caught by the whispering breeze.
Regret? They would never permit it.
Our troubles we've had, and we'll have them again,
But when solace invites only folly peeks pain.
Let us grieve when we must and till then sound the strain,
"Furgit it! Furgit it! Furgit it!" âWashington Star.
STATE NOTES.
The Tulare Times says a farmer down there was offered 50 cents an acre
for his wheat crop for pasture by a sheep man. The farmer was just start
ing for town and told the sheep man to call next day. That afternoon the
farmer drove home In the rain and his wheat crop is now worth $20 per acre,
due to the shower.
The Alta Advocate says that seines will be needed to harvest the wheat
sown on the dry bed of Tulare Lake last winter, for the lake is refilling with
water.
The Sacramento Bee reports the net profits on twenty acres of sugar
beets at Courtland to be $634, or $31 70 per acre.
An Eastern poultry raiser is looking for a location in Contra Costa
County. He puts the net profit of the business here at $2 per hen per an
num, and intends to keep 8000 hens.
There is complaint of fruit dropping, and it is wrongly ascribed to the
dry weather of last year. Quite to the contrary, it is due to the wet
weather in March of this year. The orchards that were in bloom when the
heavy rains came were injured by washing the pollen from the bloom so
that fertilization failed. Especially peaches will grow to a certain size with
out fertilization and then they wither and drop. It is no sign of any dis
ease in the tree, and the only injury is the present loss of the crop to the
extent to which it drops.
Mr. Alden Anderson of Polano County has shipped cherries already to
New Orleans, Kansas City and Chicago.
Solano County is to the front this year with great crops of hay, grain,
sugar beets and fruit.
All the men in Vacaville who were idle have been put at work thinning
peaches. Thorp was no dropping there, and the crop set is so heavy that
thinning is a necessity.
Tho Government crop report puts the condition of California wheat at
93 per cent, the highest of any State.
The new winery at Geyserville has contracted for grapes at $10 and $12
P<=>r ton, >Â»ri basis of 22 per cent sugar. The Zinfandel on that basis will bring

terday from Governors Island. New York,
and registered at the Palace. They will
immediately proceed to the inspection of
the fortifications and armament at points
around the bay.
The visit of the two officers to this city
is in line with the plans of the Depart
ment to put San Francisco and the pen
insula on Â» modern war footing. During
the past year the antiquated guns that
have been used for years for no other
purpose than an occasional salute have
been displaced by the more powerful and
effective engines of recent invention.
Mortar batteries have h<>en put in until
the swales of the foothills back of the
Presidio bristle with them.
Range finders for the new guns and the
batteries have not yet been installed,
and this duty is the primary object for
the visit here of the two representatives
of the Engineering Department.
They have already inspected the port
at San Diego, where they established
range finders at Point Lntna, and after
completing their work here will proceed
north and lnppect every fortification
along the coast as far as Vancouver.

exact science admitted the rotundity of the
earth any statement whatever upon the sub
ject could have bften considered mereiy an opin
ion. So it Is to-day with these subtler forces
of nature The Theosophists, who affirm as
proven hypotheses these occult forces so en
tertainingly described by A. Conan Doyle and
other writers, disclaim either authority or di
vine revelation for their doctrines and Insist
that each Individual can only prove or disprove
thÂ«ni for himself and for himself alone.
There are extant many well antln>ntlcated
accounts ot the Adepts and Yogis of India and
Thibet ond their remarkable knowledge of
natural forces, but there are also many who
discredit them. From the standpoint of the
Theosophist all the questions asked should be
answered In the affirmative. The materialists
declare them all moonshine or Imaginative.
The agnostics decline to answer. However, one
of the greatest of agnostics. Huxley, once wrote
that it was reasonable to suppose that there
were beings as superior to men as men are to
Mack beetle?. In the Eastorn philosophies
there are Infinite grades or beings on both
sides of man and somewhere alont In the
ascent from the ordinary man there must be,
of course, those who can accomplish all the
occult feats referred to in "The Mystery of
CloombÂ«r," providing only that the Eastern
philosophies are the true ones, and that Is a
question that no person has a right to de
cide lor another.

into the bay. The cry "A man over

Berkeley's engines were quickly reversed;
A boat was lowered in very fast time,
but it took several minutes to get back
to where Y/orke had disappeared. His
hat was found, but there was nothing

boat was rowed over and over the spot,

An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Stbui of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
Is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company

MME, CURLEY
WAS TOO FOND
OF DIAMONDS
Grave Charge Against
a Clairvoyant.
DISAPPEARED WITH THE GEMS
HEB DUPES SAID TO BE NUM-
BERED BY SCORES.
Police Asked to Arrest Her if She Is
Still in This Countryâ Left
the City in Great
Haste.
Two la die? called at police headquarters
and also upon Acting Police Judge Groez-
Inger yesterday to secure a warrant for
the arrost of Mme. E. Curley, the
spiritualist and clairvoyant, and her hus
band, on charges of swindling and lar
ceny. The ladles admitted they had been
duped by the medium, and said Mme.
Curley'e victims In this city are numbered
by scores.
Mrs. Gray, one of the ladies who seeks
to set the law officers upon the medium,
keeps a lodging house on Geary street,
and it was there that Mme. Curley and
her husband held forth up to the 6th of
this month, when they hastily departed
from the city, taking with them some
silverware anil jewelry belonging to the
landlady, bo she alleges, besides several
thousand dollars' worth of diamonds be
longing to other ladies, as well as large
sums of money.
Mrs. Gray bluntly accuses the Ourleys
of being frauds of the first water. She
says they came to her house about two
months ago. engaging the parlors. A day
or two later large advertisements ap
peared in the local papers, announcing
that Mme. Curley had come to town and
was prepared to give seances at $1 per
scar.cc. She did a rushing business from
the start, and day and night her rooms
were inronged with women. But it ap
pears Mme. Curley was not satisfied with
her legitimate business, and proceeded to
gather in all the wealth belonging to her
patrons she could get her hands on.
Mrs. Gray says the woman's scheme
was ingenious. First, she would tempt
ingly display a satchel full of gold, which
she claimed she had won for a customer
in a lottery. She also had a letter pur
porting to be from the manager of the
lottery, intimating that Mme. Curley was
particularly favored in getting winning
tickets. Many women were thus separated
from their dollars, but the scheme that
netted the largest dividends was as fol
lows: lime. Curley would tell her vic
tim that some evil Influence hovered over
the customer, and would ask if she had
any diamonds. Receiving aji afflrmatitve
reply, she would go on to say that the
diamonds were the cause of the evil In
fluence, and would ask for the gems, in
order that she mi-ght work a charm on
them that would dissipate the bad spell.
The dupe would readily hand over the
diamonds, or If she had no diamonds, thru
any other jewelry that she might pos
sess, and that was the last of them.
Two weeks ago Curley notified the land
lady that they were going away. They
got n.ew trunks and new clothing, while
the man shaved off his mustache. They
departed that day while Mrs. Gray was
out, and she says they took a quantity of
her silverware with them. The woman
had her hair combed entirely different
from the way she wore it ordinarily, in
order to change her appearance as much
as possible. Mme. Curley' 8 advertise
ments, however, were continued in the
papers for two or three days, Mrs. Gray
says, for the purpose of leading her dupes
to believe she was still here.
Mrs. Graj says that since the Curleye
went away her house has been besieged
by women who mourn the loss of coin and
lewelry they had intrusted to the me
alum. One woman from Oakland, she
Bald, lost $7f> In money and $4fÂ«> worth of
diamonds; another lost a gold watch, a
pearl ring and nearly a hundred dollars:
still another was out $700 in money, while
all had been fleeced to a greater or less
extent. It was the woman who lost 1700
that went with Mrs. Gray to get the war
rant. The landlady is of the opinion that
the Curleya have gone to Honolulu. They
catne from San Antonio. Texas, here, and
an- well known in many Southwestern
cities. Their real name is Featherman,
<"iir!'-y being an alias. The woman's
father is a photographer in St. Louis. She

M'NAB WANTS TO END
THE WAR IN LUZON
WANTS WELBURN TO SETTLE
THE MATTER.
Judge de Haven Decides That the
United States May Fight the Fil
ipinos a Little Longer
Without Him.
Much has been said concerning the
neatness of the colored troops of the
Twenty-fourth United States Infantry
stationed ;n the Presidio, but none could
; boast of a neater appearance, eleanrr uni
form or brighter brass buttons than ex-
Internal Revenue Collector O. M. Wel
burn when he stood before the bar in
United States District Judge de Haven's
I court yesterday morning.
Qavin McNab appeared for the pris-
J oner.
"We plead not guilty, your Honor." said
i Mr. McNab, "and prior acquittal on each
and every count in the present indict
ment."
Then he asked for a speedy trial and
added, "If he is acquitted he wishes to
rejoin his regiment and go to the Philip
pines, if permitted."
Notwithstanding the double "if" In his
statement. Mr. McNab put on an expres
sion of ferocity which. If it could be seen
. in the Philippines, would put an end to
the rebellion at once.
United Slates Attorney Coombs did not
; appear so eager to go to war as did the
; chieftain of the Clan McN.'ih. He wanted
! to wait until the papers in the case came
back. He was not familiar with the case
: and wished to familiarize himself with
| the record before entering upon the" trial.
Judge de Haven evidently thought it
; would not hurt the United States if the
I war in the Philippines were continued for
a month longer, for he set the trial for
i June 15.
FOSTER RELEASED.
j Owing to a Faulty Complaint He
Secures His Liberty.
Fred Foster, charged with having oh
tainnd money under false pretenses hy his
fadng partner, A. Howard, was releasfd
yesterday by Judpe J,awlor on a writ of
habeas corpus. The prisoner was dis
, charged :m<i his bonds pxonorated.
The court held that the writ for the re
i lease of the prisoner Bhouid be granted
on the ground that the complaint did not
State sufficient facts upon which to hold
the accused and also that there was a
lack of probable cause.
Poster, with Howard, owned a string of
race hrtrses, including Yellow Tall and
other valuable animals, and a short time
ago h,' removed the animals from the
I State. }{>> was arrested, and instead of
| being cj,iarp-H(] with embezzlement for 11
--! legally removing the animals from the
1 Oakland track, was brought to this city
j and charged with having obtained money
under false pretenses out of certain
! transactions surrounding the purchase
| and keeping of the animals. There was
j a misjoinder of act and Intent, and as
the complaint was faultily drawn. Judge
Lawlor had no option but to release the
prisoner on habeas corpus.
IN REVENGE SHE
THREW VITRIOL
ON HOTOP
A Betrayed Woman's
Crazy Act.
HE HAD MARRIED ANOTHER
SHE SOUGHT TO MAR HIS FEA-
TURES FOREVER.
Maggie Magee Emptied a Glassful of
the Deadly Fluid Over Fred
Hotop in a Hyd#-
Street Car.
Thorp was nlmost a tragedy in a Hyde
ptreet car yesterday morning. It was an
attempt at disfiguring a man by vitriol
throwing. The woman in the case is now
in the Harbor Hospital and the man has
several burns on his l;ands and neck; the
MAOGTE MAGEE, betrayed and
(!â¢ serted, tried to throw a glass
ful of vitriol over Fred Hotop
in a Hyde-Street car yesterday.
Miss Miigic asserts that she is the
mother of Ho top' a 3-year-old child
; c:ir looks us if it had been charred by
fire.
The woman asserts that the man is the
father of her 3-year-old child and that
he lias repeatedly pr tmised to marry her.
! Now. she says, he has married another.
Her name is Maggie Magee and she sup
ports her child by going OUt to service.
Her victim is Fred Hotop, a conductor
on the Hyde-street cars, and the alleged
father of Miss Magee' s child. He had
his woundfl dressed :l t a drug store on the
corner of Hyde and California streets,
while Miss Magee was put on a car and
! hurried to the California-street police sta
| Uon. There her face was found to be
i burned with the vitriol and she was sent j
to the Harbor Hospital. Her wounds
were dressed by Dr. yon der Leith. but it
will lie several days before she Is able to
be about again.
Miss Magce willingly told the story of
her betrayal. She is a prepossessing
woman and her hands show she is a hard
worker.
"I was employed by a family who lived
on California Btreel when I iirst met Fred
Hotop," she said. "One night when i
was out with him I overstayed my leave
and went to a friend's house. My friend j
came to the door and when she saw Fred j
and me she said half-past 11 was no hour
i for a respectable girl to be out and she
refused me admittance. Hotop then
found lodgings for us downtown.
"He repeatedly promised me marriage
and when my child was born he went i
with me to the house on Natoma street
where the little fellow Is now living and
introduced me as his wife.
"For a year I continued to keep com
pany witli Fred and continually impor
tuned him to marry me. Finally he left
me and I attempted to kill myself. He
had me taken to the City Receiving Hos
pital, where he told the doctor and the at
tendants that I was his wife. When I was
able to be moved he took me away and
I cared for me a few days. Then he left j
me entirely and I didn't see him for two j
years. Last Friday he wrote to me say-
Ing all kinds of nice things and asked me I

make everything all right. Sunday I went
to see my child and the woman who takes
care of him showed me in The Call where
Fred Hotop had secured, a license to
marry Matilda Leonhardt of 221 Eddy
street.
"When I Paw that I almost went crazy
and started for tlih City Hall to have
Fred arrested. About two years ago 1 ,
i Bwore to a warrant for his arrest on a |
: charge of seduction, but he got away and
| I thought I would put the officers on his
! track. Then I changed my mind and de
termined to make aim so ugly that the
woman who calls herself his wife would
loathe him. I secured the vitriol and hid
it under my cape. I got on the car and
j after we had ridden a few blocks Fred
came for my fare. I then asked him if it
was true that ho was married and he said
yes. Then I took the glass of vitriol from
under my cape ami attempted to throw it j
on him. He warded it off with his hand
and only a portion of it struck his neck.
' He rubbed it off with his hand and then
j put his hand on my face: that is how I
: come to be burned.
"Now the whole thing is out and I hope
Fred Hotop will be made to suffer. He
; has made, my life a hell upon earth for
three years and now he must go and
marry an innocent woman. He has never
i denied being the father of my child and 1
! have a dozen witnesses to prove that he
, has acknowledged the paternity. Now I
! will make him pay for its support."
j Hotop called upon Acting Police Judge
I Groezinger yesterday afternoon and swore
to a complaint charging the woman with !
a felony in throwing vitriol in his face. I
I Both of his cheeks, his right ear and neck j
and left hand are burned severely.
Hotop's version of the affair is that the |
â  woman boarded his car at California and ;
I Hyde streets and took a seat on the roar i
1 dummy, where he stood. After grating i
I each other, .she said: "So you hav<> got (
] married?" and Hotop replied in the af
firmative. She continued to talk to him,
off and on, until the car, which was going
to the beach, reached Greenwich street.
She was carrying a cloak under her arm.
i but he did "Ot suspect any evil design on
1 her part. Just as the car was passing
i Greenwich street she lifted the cloak off
i her arm, and he noticed that she held a
I jelly glass with a tin top in her hand.
I She raised her arm, and, intuitiveiy di-
and when she hoard last Sunday that
he had married another she 'deter
mine! to spoil his gon<] looks. Mips
Ma gee is under arrest oh a charge of
"attempting to do serious bodily
harm," and Hotop is also under ar
rest charged with seduction.
vining. her purpose, he grasped her arm
and the acid struck the top of the car' !
but a portion struck him on the face and
neck. Some of it also went int.. her face
he top of the ear looked as if it had
passed through a fire.
"She rode on the car" said He. top "till
it reached the end of. the track and came
back on it to Grant avenue. I thought
she would got off, hut when she made no
motion, to do so I asked her what she
Intended doing, and she said she was go- i
ing to tide on the car with mo, and she
tendered me a nickel. When the car
ached California and Hyde streets I was
relieved, and went Into a drugstore on the
corner and had my face attended to. The
pain was severe, but I was determined not
to leave the car. She followed me into
the drugstore, and in a minute or two a
policeman came in and I told him what
had happened and asked him to arrest
her. He did so, and under the officer's
advice I came here to swear out the war
rant.
"I have known the woman for some
years, but I had not seen her for three
years till about two weeks ago, when [ac
cidentally ran against her. She wanted
me to make a date with her, and I put
her off. Then she wrote me a letter and
1 replied that 1 would see her some night
and explain matters to her. I was mar
ried two weeks ago to a sister of Charley
Leonhardt of Leonhardt & Haggerty of
the Pabst Cafe, and that is what I wanted
to explain to her. The woman had a child
about three years ago and blamed me for
being the father of the child, but her
charge is not true."
As soon as Hotop had sworn to the com
plaint he was arrested by Policeman Ran
klne on a warrant sworn out September
25. 18%, by the woman for betrayal under
promise of marriage. For some reason or
other the warrant had not been served. It
was sworn out in Judge Conlan's court.

EASTERN MARKETS.
ST.W YORK BTOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 15.â Opening quotations in
the stock market were a vigorous notice served
on all parties that ample capital was forthcom- |
ing to take up all offTincs which timid hold- j
ers of the 80-called Flower stocks choose to
offer and also to the bears that powerful wea
pons were in hand to resist any onslaught by
them. The different member* of the lower
group were opened up 1 to 3 points above Sat
urday's close, the favorites of the late finan- i
cial dealer. Brooklyn Rapid Transit and Peo
ple's Gas leading the rise. New York Airbrake
in its usual volatile manner made an excep
tional rise of 11 points in the first few minutes.
These aggressive tactics served to dissipate any
uneasiness in the speculative mind remaining
after the violent fluctuation? in Saturday's
market. Early quotations from London also
made it evident that there were large reserves â 
of capital prepared to take advantage of any
further sympathetic declines in the general list
of securities. The buying there be: ore the
opening here was not only for New York ac
count, presumably with the purpose of sup
porting values, but also on orders from Beat
lam!, Germany and Holland, as well as a local
English demand. The high opening here, es
pecially in the Flower stocks, invited a con
siderable volume of offerings, but these were
absorbed without the slightest hesitation, and
in a short time they materially decreased. The
pressure of liquidation being relieved, the vigor
of the efforts at BUDport was somewhat re
lax. J. Prices having failed to break, the bar
gain hunters were deterred from buying, and
the market fell into a quiet state. A brisk
upward movement in Sugar to 154% and a lively ;
demand for the Pacifies and the Grangers
caused a general stiffening again throughout
the list. Hut the smallness of the transaction^
discouraged a continuance of the bull specu
lation and the market fell to a condition of
comparative Inactivity. The movement of
prices became decidedly Irregular, some of the
more obscure specialties fluctuating quite
widely, but in the contrary directions. This
was notably the case among the Iron and steel
stocks. Tennessee Coal, Colorado Fuel and Na
tional Steel referred being notably weak.
American Smelting and the coalers were also
consistently weak. This "tendency and the ap
parent withdrawal of supporting orders Invited
a raid by the bears late in the day. directed
particularly against Metropolitan Street Hall
way, which was raided down 3 points. The
Grangers and Pacifies also suffered In the de
cline, except Central and Southern Pacific,
which were consistently strong. Metropolitan
Street Railway rallied very strongly I points,
the local traction shares responding in sym
pathy. The bear traders covered, making the
closing firm. The conspicuous changes were in
the Flower stocks, which all closed higher,
though below the highest of the day. Other
wise changes in the prominent stocks were not
lartse. Net gains predominated.
In the bond market there were some very
heavy taking of Baltimore and Ohio fours

The Debt of London.
The Finance Committee of the London
County Council have just prepared a re
turn showing for the year 1597-8 the
charge on the rates of each parish in the
County of London and the amount of
loans outstanding for which each parish
is liable in respect of parish loans union
loans, district loans, and central and coun
ty loans, together with the equivalent
rate in the pound of the charge and the
percentage of the loans outstanding to
the ratable value of the parish. A mem
orandum is prefixed to tin- return which
summarizes the detail and shows for each
class of local authority and for all Lon
don the total charpe In respect of loans
and the total amount of loans outstand
ing, tog-ether with a division of the total
charge between interest and repayment.
The total debt of London secured on the
rates is now Â£40.870,639. and involves
charge on the rates of Â£2,596.244, of which
Â£1.185.560 is interest and Â£1,407 ,654 repay
ment. The total debt is equivalent to 113' i
per cent of the ratable (annual) value,
and the charge is equal to an average
I rate over all London of Is sV*d in the
: pound. The debt of the City Corporation.
i not being secured on the rates, is not in
cluded in the return. At the end of 1597
; it amounted to Â£4.929.300, and involved a
I charge of Â£289,140 in the year.â London

ASKED TO RESIGN
Defies the Vestry and Will Act

the Controversyâ His Statement

Oakland Office Pan Francisco Tall,

Rev. Victor Marshall Law, rector of the
Church of the Advent, has been asked by
the vestry to resign, and this an: -
ment has startled every Episcopalian In
the State. 1j is not unlikely thai
Rational church trial may be the r
The n. trotiations have reached this
stag* Iâthat1 â that the rector wants
ths 1 vacation and may resign at the
end of that time: the vestry will give two
months, but require a resigi I

career, and it Is eagerly awaiting the
finish of the controversy.
The polity of the Episcopal church in
America provides that it rector can hold
office for â¢â â  unless proved to be a heretic
or guilty of gross misconduct. Dr. Law
will not resign, the vestry is at a loss to
induce him -to do so and at present it ; s
probable that the rector will take a long
vacationâ just how long nobody knows,
Several months ago one of the vestry
men suggested to Rev. Dr. Law that it
would be in the interests- of harmony if
he resigned. The rector indignantly re
fused to consider any such proposal and
it was agreed that matters should be left
as they were until the return of J. J.
Valentine from his Eastern trip. Mr.
Valentine is senior warden of the church
and rector-vostryman. His colleagues are
Messrs. Pope, Jones, Stalder, Read, Burr
and Foote. Of these seven all but two,
it is said, have expressed a desire for a
new rector.
ThÂ« matter was thoroughly discussed

We know from analysis just what it
is that leaves the brain under press of
work, and that little element should
be replaced each day from food. Often
the food does not supply it as rapidly

church members to vote for a Dem.,
candidate tor the City Council, and a lit
tle investigation showed thai th< Repub
opponent of this Democrat was for
m< rly a pillar of the Church of the Ad
vent who had left because he could not
agree with Dr. Law.
The rector is also the inventor of a
hygienic communion chalice anil also of
patent lips for holding the mustache up
while drinking from a coffee cup.
Vestryman Pope says that Dr. Law has
not yet handed In his resignation, but
that be will probably go on a vacation.
The rector's friends in the church de
clare that Vestryman Valentine, in view
Of al! tlie fnvors shown him by Dr. Law.
should cause it to be known that he
is by the rector and approves of his
course. Dr. Law has always appointed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 16, 1899.
Mr. Valentine his special representative
in the vestry, which is the greatest honor
in the gift of the rector in the Episcopal
church. The Choir and Nave, of
which the rector is editor, has never lost
an opportunity to heap eulogies on the
wealthy Mr. Valentine. He has been
thanked generously and oft for donating
carpets, windows and the means for thor
oughly renovating the church, all of
whi.h has made Mr. Valentine a very
prominent member of the Church of the
Advent, and also throughout this dio
cese. While Dr. Law was away on a va
cation two years ago Mr. Valentine
planned a happy surprise for him. When
the rector returned the church had been
made to look almost new in every par
ticular, and the next number of the
c noir and Nave was facetiously referred
to as "a Valentine."
In this hour of Dr. Law's trouble Mr.
\ alt-mine has not yet given him the as
surance which his friends think he de
serves. They also say freely that for a
church with such a wealthy membership
JIOO per month Is a very paltry salary.
They compare it with the $6000 per an
num paid to Dr. Coyle of the Presbyte
rian church and the $4000 paid Dr. Brown
of the Congregational church. For the
work that Mrs. Law does training the
choir and playing the organ $25 per month
is also thought to be very small.
The statement prepared by Dr. Law,
but which he did not read, would have
hern one of the most remarkable docu
ments ever heard from the pulpit
of an Episcopal church. It was
not read because Attorney W. S.
C.oodftllow advised the rector to
refrain. It was a denial of cer
tain rumors that had gained currency
that Dr. Law was using drugs more than
was necessary. Dr. Lair vigorously de
nied this slander and offered to stay with
any member of his congregaiion for any
time, from a week to a year, to satisfy
him of the utter falsity of the rumor. He
also defied any one to discover any store
where he had ever purchased drugs in
thi^ State. The rector stated that he was
led to make such denials l>y reason of a
conversation over a telephone between
certain parties known to him. It was rep
resented to Dr. Law that such a state
ment would provoke iinncc -ssary pub
licity. He was assured that the rumors
were not credited and not worthy such
refutation.

Captain P. E. Buchan is of the Twen

body will be taken to Kansas for inter- |

man of the Report pressrooms, but went j
to Manila to assume a position in the
Government printing: office. He did not
like the climate and came back to San
Francisco.
The Valencia experienced fine weather
throughout the trip except on Sunday '
night, when she was caught in a heavy
gale off the Farallones.
Some wharf rats made a good haul at
the depot for the Sacramento River boats
last Sunday. They got under the wharf I
in a boat and then clambered up a pile.
A large quantity of wine and canned
goods was secured and passed down into
the boat. When all that could be com
fortably carried away was secured the
thieves departed in peace. Strange to say,
about the time the robbery is supposed
to have been committed Agent of the
Steamers White was within a hundred '
yards of the depot talking to some !
friends. The harbor police are now on
the trail of the stolen goods.
The battleship lowa is being made
ready to go on the drydock. The schoon- >
ers Shasta, Alpine and Solano were in
spected yesterday and to-day they will go
alongside the battleship to receive 450
tons of ammunition. They will then sail
up to Mare Island and discharge their
load. After the lowa has been cleaned
i and overhauled the munitions of war will
be brought down from the navy yard and
â  put aboard again. Everything possible is â 
being taken out of the battleship in order ,
to lighten her so that there may be no I
difficulty in getting her into the dry
dock. â¢=> '
An experiment that has proved a great
BUCCess in Hawaii anil Manila is to be
tried in Fiji. In the former places all the
work on the plantations is done by mules,
but in Fiji the horse i-s still employed.
The nobler animal does not stand the cli
mate well and the cost of horseflesh adds
considerable to the price of sugar in Fiji.
The planters are now going to try the
mules and thirty-two of the animals will
leave here on the Moana to-morrow.
They WHI be taken as far as Auckland,
X. '/.., where they will be. given a week's
rest, after which they will be put aboard
another steamer and sent on to Suva.
Fiji. Should the experiment prove to be
a success the shipment of mules by the
Australian steamers will become a regu

Captain McLeod of the brig Lurline and

the run hen- from the islands in nine

while It took the Wrestler twenty-three
days to come up. Captain Nelson blames
the light winds he ran Into, and Bays the
Wrestler can easily beat the Lurline.

thirty-six days to cover the distance.
Captain Ward reports light winds and

Child Falls Fifty Feet.
OAKLAND, May 15.â Little Edle Marr,
the five-year-old daughter of William

deck of the vessel City of Dawson this
morning into the black mud below,
miraculously escaping a horrible death.
The City of Dawson is anchored near
Hay & Wright's ship yard in the estuary.
She is a three-decked vessel, and this
morning while Mrs. Marr was visiting
Captain and Mrs. Smith on the craft the
child slipped under the railing of the
upper dock and fell into the mud. a dis
tance of fifty feet below. The child was
recovered from the suffocating mud and
its apparently lifeless body taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where the little one
afterward revived. Not a bone was
broken, and save a contusion on the left
cheek which closed the eye on that side
and a few abrasions on the lower limbs
the little girl is sound as ever.

PSYCHOLOGY CANNOT
OVERLOOK THE SOUL
SO SAYS PROFESSOR DEWEY
OF CHICAGO.
A Noted Eastern Scholar Delivers the
Annual Lecture on Philosophy
at the University of
California.
BERKELEY, May 15.â Harmon Gym
nasium on the university campus was
i filled with a large audience to-night at
| tracted by the name of Professor John
| Dewey of the University of Chicago.
Professor Dewey came to California at
the invitation of the Berkeley Philo
sophical Union to deliver the annual
I public lecture on philosophy during the
! university commencement week. In the
East he has gained recognized standing
as a scholar of note, his fame resting
| upon several philosophical treatises of
| which he is the author. In the l.'niversity
of Chicago his position corresponds to
â  that of Professor George H. Howison at
Berkeley as head of the department of
philosophy.
Professor Howison introduced the dis
tinguished visitor. Professor Dewey had
chosen for a subject "Psychology and
i Philosophical Method." His address was
a somewhat technical discussion intended
to point out the limits and proper meth
! ods of procedure of psychology as a
science. The lecturer took exception to
two prevailing views current With regard
to the subject. The first, termed sensa
tional psychology, he criticized as utterly
disregarding the value of the soul and
the dignity of human life.
"The scientist Who regards the soul
merely as states of consciousness Of
such." he said, "is like a man who would
study the eye without ever recognizing
that' the eye was made for sight. He
imight make an exhaustive analysis of its
1 cells and of its parts with their relations
i to one another, but unless he proceeded
I upon the basis that all these cells and all
! the various and intricate parts were only
1 significant in their bearing upon the func
tion of seeing, he would be lost in hope
i less and useless details. These, while
valuable from a scientific standpoint.
i could have no interest for actual human
; life. He would be studying the eye as
such, disregarding its connection with
I the complete experience of actual vision."
Spiritualism, the opposite extreme to
j this view, Professor Dewey pronounced
las equally false. They were both, he de-
clared, the source of all the scandals con
nected with psychology, the one leading
to the denial of the sou!'/ existence and
hence to agnosticism and skepticism, and
the other supporting theories and conclu
sions' rejected by common-sense,
As against these two extremes Profes
sor Dewey favored a middle course de
signed to take into account all the deeper
issues of life, the loving, doubting, striv
ing, the searching aft*?r ideals and living
up to them, which constitute the basis of
an unseen yet nevertheless eternally real
existence. Along these lines, he conclud
ed, psychology ought to proceed in an at
tempt to study the individual as spirit
ually related to God and to humanity.
France's New President.
President I^oubet, the new President of
â France, i?, if anything;, calm, sane, a trifle
bonrgeola and utterly devoid of sense of self
importance. But there is a strong and irre
sistible will behind his bland faoe, and he
looks like a man who would infuse into run
down French politics as much vigor and new
life as Hostetter's Stomach Bitters will into
the run-down system of any one who uses it.
It is an absolute cure for the worst of all
stomach disorders.

A NEW SCHEME

THE SCAVENGERS
Monopoly Wanted by
Reduction Works.
I
ASK SUPERVISORS TO ACT i
A FAR-REACHING ORDINANCE j
PROPOSED.
Gas Bills Laid Over for Another â¢
Week Other Business of a
Purely Routine Char
acter.
â¦
The proprietors of the Sanitary Reduc- !
tion Works have asked the Board of Su- !
pervlsors to pass an ordinance requiring
oil persons to pay 20 cents a cubic foot
for the destruction of fuse and garbage
of every description. The proprietors of â¢
the reduction works had drafted an or- '
finance, ami his was presented to the
board at its meeting â¢-â â ;â  afternoon. |
Hy its provisions the proposed ordinance I
makes i: a misdemeanor punishable by !
line and imprisonment for any person to i
deposit on the ground or in the water
over which the city has jurisdiction any
kind of rubbish: garbage or offal, includ
ing ashes, tin cans, broken crockery and ;
so on down the list of such things that
may or may not be considered under the
Kciicral head of ''garbage.'.' Having so j
ordained; the proposed law requires that,
articles arid matter of the kind and de- j
scription enumerated shall be transported
to the plant of the Sanitary Reduction
Works and there deposit^ for incinera
tion) the owners of the garbage being re
quired to pay not less than 20 cents per |
cubic yard to the owners of the reduction '
works for the garbage thus deposited.
The proposed ordinance was referred to
the Health and Police Committee for con- j
slderation. Jt will, no doubt, be mad( the !
basis of a vigorous protest from the j
garbage men, scavengers and property |
owners, for by Its provisions it makes j
every householder, storekeeper and. in i
fact, almost every adult person in the j
city an involuntary contributor to the
business of the Sanitary Reduction Works j
at a price iix-Mi without apparent refer
ence to the cost of the service offered in
return;
At the suggestion of Mayor Phelan, an i
amendment to the proposed ordinance was '
offered in the shape of a specification i
making ii incumbent upon the City Engi- ;
neer to measure all scavenger carts and \
certify as to their capacity, which ( erl I- \
ricatlon shall be taken by the reduction
works as official and final.
A resolution was adopted directing the j
City and County Engineer to make a sur- i

by which the resolution to provide the 1

proving certain districts in the Mission j

The board were pledged.
The several motions made by Super

TRIED TO BLACKMAIL
AN ARMY OFFICER
Unsuccessful Attempt to Extort Money
From Major Matthews of the
Presidio Hospital.
During His Absence a Discharged Soldier Opens
His Desk and Steals Valuable Papers.
Arrested by One of His
Comrades.
THROUGH the effort? of Sergeant
of Police Baldwin and J. J
:m attache of the general
.il at th<> Presidio, a clevi r
h. heme to blackmail the Govern
m< in has; been brought to light.
As the result ,1. A. Weed, a dis
charged soldier, is under arrest charged
with grand larceny. The police are
searching for another man who it is,
claimed assisted Weed in his abortive
attempt to blackmail the Government
,:id incidentally the officers at the Presl-
Aboul a week ago \Wid. who was then
Hospital Corps, during
the temporary absence of the officer in
charge, broke open the Instrument case
tracted about $80 worth of instru
ments. After placing the stolen imple
ments in a sack winch lie had provided
for the Durpose. it is alleged he forced
open the private desk of Major Mat
thews, who has charge of the Presidio
hospital, and appropriated some valuable
documents. He also confiscated the .cor
respondence of the officer in charge' and
general memorandum books belonging to
Major Matthews' private secretary.
The robbery was discovered a short
time afterward and at once reported to
th* police. Chief Lees detailed Sergeant
Baldwin, who enlisted In the arm) of
volunteers during the war with- Spain
and was afterward promoted to be cap
tain of the regiment, to arrast the cul
prit. Discarding his uniform, Baldwin
went among the attaches of the hospital
and by dint of investigation he learned
that Weed was the man he wanted. As
the correspondence was sent from Wash
ington and was of vital importance to the
Government, Major Matthews instructed
Sergeant Baldwin to do all in his power
to arrest the culprit and primarily to re
cover the stolen letters.
Not knowing Weed the astute police of
ficer took J. J. Cooke, who is connected
â¢with the hospital staff, Into his confidence.
After apprising Cooke of the loss of the
documents Baldwin asked him to assist
him in running down the suspected thief.
Cooke promised to lend his efforts in
catching the discharged soldier, but was
â¢warned to be on his guard, as Weed
â would not hesitate to shoot if necessary.
While Baldwin and Cooke were scouring
the city for Weed Private Detective Lu
cas visited the Presidio hospital and
asked Major Matthews If his private cor
respondence had been stolen. When an
swered in the affirmative Lucas said that
he could get the stolen letters and anx
iously inquired if a reward had been of
fered for their return. Suspecting, as he
claims, that Lucas was endeavoring to
extort money from him Major Matthews,
to whom he had addressed his conversa
tion, ordered him to leave the hospital.
"Get. out of here," angrily retorted the
major. "Your leg is as black as your
whiskers."
Lucas attempted to explain and was un
ceremoniously hustled out of the hospi
tal.
In the meantime the police were again
appealed to by Major Matthews not to
spare any time in finding Weed and the
stolen documents. As the documents con
sisted of private communications sent to
him by the Secretary of War and told
of the movements of the American troops
at Manila and other hostile places Mat
thews was extremely anxious to recover
them.
Willie Sergeant Baldwin was scouring
the city for Weed Private Cooke of the
hospital corps encountered him on Ellis
street last Sunday morning. He was ac
eompaned by another man, for whom the
police are now searching.
Acting under instructions 4(om Ser
geant Baldwin Cooke proceeded to get
Weed and his accomplice ; intoxicated.
After they had become inebriated Cooke
broached the subject of the robbery at
the Presidio Hospital.
"Don't 'say a word," remarked. Weed in
a maudlin tone; "they must come up with
the stuff or something Is going to happen.
I have been to the newspapers ana the
editors are crazy to get possession of the
documents." One of them offered me ten
thousand dollars to give him the papers.
Poor old Matthews mu3t be sore. We
have communicated with the authorities
al Washington and nave given our price.
They must come to nir or then- will be
trouble. If the contents of the docu
ments were published there would be a
hot old time at the Presidio."
Cooke managed to wring from the dis
charged .soldier that the documents were
lr. his room '>n Mission street, together
with the books belonging to Major Mat
thews' private secretary. After getting
the number of the room Cooke slipped
away from Weed and his friend and went
to th place.
With the aid of a skeleton key with
which he had provided himself he entered
the room, and in a burvau drawer he
found the precious documents,. Placing
them in his cdat pocket lie started to
leave the house, when he was confronted
by Weed and his accomplice. The for
mer, evidently suspecting that he had
got away with the papers that he had
stolen, asked him what he was doing in
' Is room. Cooke explained that he was
visiting a friend and was about to walk

placing his" hand on his revolver; "I'll
send you to tho morgue if you make a
move."
Evidently mindful of the warning given
him by his superior officer, Cooke drew
his revolver, determined to protect him
self in case Weed attempted to shoot him. â¢
At this Juncture a citizen named H. 11.
Iveach happened to come alonp. and Bee-
Ing the revolver In Cooke's hand, asked
him what the trouble was. Cooke whis
pered to him that Weed was wanted for
stealing valuable Government documents !
and asked him to induce the discharged
soldier to accompany him to the City \
Leach then spoke to Weed, and after ;
listening to the story as to how he h:id
been "robbed" by Cooke. suggested that
they go to police headquarters to settle
matters. _ _ .
After reaching the City Prison Cooke
ha.-tily Informed Corporal Parrote of the
robbery at the Presidio hospital and the
efforts of the police in trying to run down
Weed. The latter, at this juncture, ac- ;
costed Parrote and demanded that Cooke
be arrested for drawing a revolver on ;
â rnme inside and tell your stories to
Sergeant Brown," advised Parrote
through the wicket of the door leading
to the City Prison. :
As the door swung open Cooke entered, !

Cooke repeated the story of how he had ,
recovered the stolen documents and asked |
that Weed be detained until Sergeant
Baldwin could be notified. As a precau
tionary measure Desk Sergeant Brown
charged Cooke with carrying a concealed |
weapon. Weed's name was registered on |
the "small" book, pending further inves- ;
tigation. -..-_.
Yesterday morning Sergeant Baldwin
learned of Cooke's predicament and rush- j
ing to Judge Mogan'a court he had the ;
case against him dismissed. Subs<- j
quently Weed was formally charged with
grand larceny. When seen in the City |
Prison he refused to make a statement, j
except to say that he would "get even"
on Cooke when he is released from jail, j
The police expect to apprehend Weed's !
accomplice to-day.
The documents zero in the possession of
the Property Clerk of the Police Depart
ment, who refuses to reveal their con
tents. Major Matthews is equally reti
cent, but he admits he is extremely anx
ious to have the documents restored to
his keeping.

IMPORTANT ACTION TAKEN
BOARD OF EDUCATION MAKES
STRINGENT RULES.
Report of the Committee on Elemen
tary Schools Adopted at a Spe
cial Session â Check Placed
on the Principals.
The Board of Education made a great
stride toward raising the standard of the
public schools of this city last night when
it adopted the report of the committee on
elementary schools, in referen.ee to the
examination of pupils for promotion to
higher grades. Heretofore there has been
a great deal of laxity in the matter of
conducting examinations fur promotion;
In fact, in many of the schools the cus
tom has been to promote whole classes
simply on the recommendation of the
teachers through the principals. This an
tiquated method Is to he done away with
completely and the principals will here
ai'trr be held strictly accountable for the
efficiency and qualifications of the pupils
under their charge. Those pupils who fall
to attain the degree of perfection re
quired for promotion to a higher grade
will not be able to secure advancement
through the good offices of their teachers
as heretofore.
The board met in special session to re
ceive the report of the committee, which
was presented in the form of a set of res
olutions prepared by Superintendent Web
ster by request, as follows: .
Resolvedâ Firstâ That written examina
tions for promotion of pupils in all grades
from the fourth to the eighth, both inclu- \
sive, be held at dates to be designated I v
the superintendent, in the following manner,
to wit:
Teachers of succeeding (trades under the
supervision of principals shall examine and
credit the papers of the pupils of the grades
next preceding on questions submitted from
the superintendent's office in the following
subjects of study, to wit:
(a) Spelling, defining, word analysis;
standard 100 credits.
fl>) Grammar or language lessons; stand
ard 100 credits. Â»
(c) Arithmetic (written); standard 100
(d) Arithmetic (mental): standard &0
credits.
(c) Geography; standard 100 credits.
(f) History; standard 100 credit*.
Secondâ That pupils of the ninth grade
report to the high schools at dates to be
designated by the superintendent, and there
be examined by the faculties thereof in
questions to be submitted from the super
intendent's office on subjects specified in
the first.
Third â That a minimum percentage of 60
in each subject and a minimum average of
70 per cent be required for promotion.
Fourthâ That the scope of the examination
for each grade be as indicated by the
schedule of work dated July 28, IS9S.
Fifthâ All â  papers submitted by pupils
shall be credited and placed in the custody
of the principal on the morning following
the day on' which the examination is given,

tary's (ice to the superintendent before 10
o'clock on said morning.
That class reports stating the names of
pupils, the percentage secured by each on
each subject and on the average shall be
sent to the superintendent on the day fol
lowing the date of the final examination.
The board went into committee of the
whole to consider the report. After a
long: discussion the committee arose and
reported in favor of the adoption of the
report, which was at once none.
"I regard the adoption of the report of
the Committee on Elementary Schools as
the most important action the board has
taken in months," said President Ber
gerot after adjournment. "There will bo
no more promotions without proper ex
aminations and the principals of the va
rious schools will be held strictly ac
countable for the enforcement of the new
rule. Our purpose is to put a check on
principals and to raise the standard of
the schools, which has been seriously im
paired by the lax methods of the past,
and it is expected that this result will be
largely attained by the enforcement of
these resolutions."
RECORDING MINING LOCATIONS.
An Important Opinion Relating to
State Laws and District Rules.
Mining locations was the subject of an
opinion rendered by Attorney General 'ii
rey L. Ford yesterday. It was in reply
to a letter from James W. Bartlett of
Weaverville and bears upon the duties
of County Recorders with reference to re
cording mining locations and the fees for
the same. After setting forth the laws
bearing upon the question Mr. Ford
writes:
From the foregoing provisions I conclude
that a notice of a mining claim is entitled to
be recorded in the county in which the claim
is situated; that It is the duty of the County
Recorder to keep books for that purpose and
to record the same, upon the payment of the
fees, in the same manner as he Is required in
recording other instruments.
As before seen there is at present no State
law requiring such notices to be recorded and
their recordatlon Is not necessary. If the dis
trict mining rules should require such notices
to be recorded in the office of the County He
corder then it Is my opinion that the notice
should be so recorded, and. it would be the
duty of the Recorder to record it In the proper
books. Heretofore a great many of the min
ing districts in this State had rules requiring
notices of location to be posted and . recorded
in the office of the County Recorder.
That such notices, when bo recorded, might
constitute a good and legal record of the pos
sessory claim seems to have been the object
the Legislature had In view in making pro
vision for their recordation. Such notices, how
ever, are not required, to be recorded with the
County Recorder in the absence of a district
rule or custom requiring the same. Out when
there is a district rule or custom requiring the
notice to be recorded with the County Re
corder, then, as before seen, the -Legislature
has. by the sections of , the code referred to
made provision for their recordation. Â» â¢ â¢ '

PATRICK TIERNEY WAS
A WELL-TO-DO BEGGAR
He Lived in a Ten -Cent Lodging House and Had a
Hoard of Money in Bank.
PATRICK TIERNEY was a professional beggar and lived in all the filth,
squalor and privation that are supposed to be the lot of paupers, but he had
$900 in the Hlbernia Bank and real estate in this city valued at $40u0.
A little more than six months ago he was convicted of being a profes
sional healthy beggar, and was given a sentence of six months' imprisonment in
the County Jail. His term of imprisonment expired a fow days ago and he re
sumed his old avocation; but his system had been undermined by the unwonted
cleanliness and the good board of the jail and he emerged from prison a sick
man.
Yesterday morning the bedmaker. an ex-prize lighter whose duty it is to
arouse late sleepers among the 'â bums" who patronize the Empire Lodging House
at 639 Clay street, found that Mr. Tiarney had got more than his 10 cents' worth
out of the house, for he couldn't get out of bed without the assistance of the
Coroner's deputies and a black box from the Morgue.
Tierney was an old man and death was undoubtedly due to natural causes.

Bicycle Order Delayed.
OAKLAND, May 15.â The City Council
to-night again postponed action on the
bicycle ordinance. A delegation of wheel
men, headed by Seth Mann, appeared be
fore the Council and made a plea that
cyclists who respected the law should not
be ordered off the sidewalks and that the
law-breakors should be arrested and pun
ished. Other petitions asked that the
cyclists be kept off the sidewalks entire
ly, and the matter was again sent back
to the street committee. It also passed
a resolution ordering the Board of Works
to paint the City Hall steps, as the En
deavorers are to gather here Wednesday
for the State convention.
TO EXCLUDE JAPANESE
FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS
The Western Addition Improvement Club
Will Institute a Crusade.
Strong Resolutions Adopted by Three Hundred
Prominent Citizens Urging That the $1.10
Gas Rate Be Recognized.
THE Western Addition Improve
ment Club, composed of over three
hundred of the leading citizens^ and
principal taxpayers of San Fran
cisco, has commenced a crusade
for the exclusion of Japanese chil
dren from the public schools. This is the
first move which has been made in this
matter, and the club proposes to press
its import on the citizens of this city by
a stringent resolution, which will be in
troduced at its next meeting.
Dr. Charles V. Cross, the president of
the association, brought the matter to
the. attention of the members present.
He urged that it was not within the prov
ince of the United States to educate these
foreigners and that some action should
be taken as early as possible toward clos
ing the doors of our educational system
against them. The doctor stated that he
had many instances in mind where par
ents of girls attending the public schools
of this city were obliged to apply to the
school authorities for the seating of their
children away from the Japanese boys,
and that their presence was distasteful to
American children generally. In part he
said:
"We should appeal to the Board of
Education to exclude Japanese from our
schools. They are not only objectionable
In school rooms, but they occupy seats
which should be reserved for white chil
dren. In many cases children of our own
birth are required to wait months for a
place in the schools, notwithstanding that
hundreds of these foreigners are daily ab
sorbing the advantages which they are
losing. Like the Chinese, they return to
their own land with the money they inter
out of American trade, and never advance
themselves or enhance their surround-
ings.
"Japanese take undue advantage of I
education. They are at present em- ]
ployed by families in positions which
could well be filled by daughters of Amer
ican birth, who need employment, but i
who to-day are obliged to walk the i
streets. Our schools exclude Chinese, and I
1 can discover but little difference be- |
tween the two nationalities, either in in
tellect or manners."
The club then passed a significant reso
lution condemning the excessive rates of ;
the gas monopoly and urging its members
to abide by the rate of $1 10 us fixed by '
the Board of Supervisors early last
month. The resolution was the outcome
of much discussion, in which both sides
of the question were givr-n a proper air
ing and expert testimony offered as to
the cost of the production of gas. The
resolution, introduced by Joseph Nash
and seconded by Charles M. Ingram, was
passed as follows:
Resolved, That it is the sense of
the Western Addition Improvement
Club that the rate of SI 10 for gas, as
made by the Board of Supervisors, is
a fair price and the only legal rate
the gas company can collect; and be it
further
Resolved, That we recommend our
members to pay their bills on that
basis only.
Since the passing of the resolution by
the Supervisors the club has had in con
templation a move by which it could sc
j cure concerted action on the gas ques
; tion. Leading members of the organiza
; tion proposed that it be made the special
S subject for deliberation last night and a
I general notification was sent out. Men
responded t" the roll-call who had not at
i tended meetings for months but who. as
I they expressed it. were anxious for an op
| portunity to strike a blow which might
secure what they believed be a fair and
just price of illumination for the resi
dents of Western San Francisco. M'hÂ»-n
the resolution came to a vote there was
not a dissenting voice.
It was universally the sentiment of the
members present that the gas company
I has been paying large dividends on about
i three times as much stock as it should
possess, and that the combustible could
be manufactured at a figure far less than
the dollar mark.
The speakers denounced the excessive
rate as an outrage on the public, and
urged that the association institute a
crusade which would result in the tear

ing down of rate? to a basis which would
permit an equitable margin of gain for
the producer, and protect the rights of
the consumer. Those present, who were
conversant with law. declared that a rate
fixed by the Supervisors could be changed
but once during a year and that for that
period of time at least the people of San
Francisco have been unburdened of a
flagrant hardship.
While radical changes in the education
al system were being discussed it was
suggested that the playgrounds surround
ing schools be increased. The following^
resolution for a new high school, to 1^
erected at the corner of Sacramento ana
Gough streets, was passed:
Resolved, That a committee of throe be ap
pointed to carry out the resolution of the club
favoring the appropriation of $250,000 for a new
building for the Lowell High School, the com
mittee to be instructed to confer -with other
clubs in the city and urge thfir co-operation In
the matter, and that the Board of Kducation bÂ«
requested to recommend to the Supervisors thnt
the said appropriation be incorporated in the
proposed bond issue.
The committee named was composed of

POLICE MAY STOP IT.
San Francisco Club Determined ta
Pull Off Its Big Fight.
The friends of the colored heavy-weight
champion pugilist of the world, Peter
Jackson, will meet on Friday evening in
the Alcazar building for the purpose of
arranging for a testimonial benefit to be
given to the retired puncher, who in his
heyday of prosperity befriended many a
well-deserving person. Among the pa
trons of tistic sport who have taken an
interest in the affair are James Gilleran,
Young Mitchell. Jim Dunne, Billy Akers,
Jack Walsh, Jack Stelzner and others.
I'nless the San Francisco Athletic Club
will have secured a license from the Su
pervisors it is doubtful if the Chief of
Police will permit the entertainment,
which is booked for this evening, to take
place.
The principal event will be a contest be
tween the heavy-weights, "Jack" Stelzner
and "Jim" Jeffords, and unless Stelzner -m
has gone back very much since his last
appearance in the ring he should have
little difficulty in whipping Jeffords, who
is a big, husky but awkward fellow with
very little experience. The. preliminaries
will consist of four and eight round bouts
between young bo-xers, and so far as pit
ting youngsters for contests which re
quire the contestants to be in flrst-clas.i
condition the club should be careful in its
selections, as only those who are physi
cally sound should be accepted.
ROBBED THE SHERIFF
Sneak Thieves Break Into His Office, ,
but Secure Little Loot.
Sneak thieves robbed the office of Sher
iff Martin Sunday, and now that official,
!In conjunction with the police, is en
| gaged in a vain search for the mis
i creants. "Of course, I do not wish them
i any harm," he says, "but all the same
I I would like to have them for my guests
i at the County Jail."
'. The thief or thieves were not, apparent -
I ly, experts in their business. By walk
i ing along a cornice over the basement
! story of the building, to which a<
I was had from one of the windows open
| ing out of the Larkin street corridor, the
I thieves gained a window opening into the
i room set apart for the use of the Deputy
â  Sheriffs. The window was open and they
| had but to raise it to gain access to the
i interior. Once inside, they set about the
i task of looking for valuables.
They pried open all of the lockers and
j the drawers of all the desks, but all of )
value they could find was a couple of r
! second-hand and almost worthless revol
! ' vers and a pair of handcuffs.
The thieves next tried to get into the
\ Sheriff's private office, but the connect
ing door proved to be an obstacle they
| could not overcome. After damaging the
â  door to some extent with the chisel they
| had used to pry open the drawers, they
gave up the attempt and departed. The
I police are of the opinion that the work
I was done by a couple of petty sneak
| thieves.
