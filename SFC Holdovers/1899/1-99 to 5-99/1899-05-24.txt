ington correspondent of the
Herald telegraphs: I learned to
day that '.he attention of the State
Department has been called to the re
cent occupation by Japan of Marcus
Island, in the I" .cine. The acquisition
of this is] and by Japan has had the
effect of lining a change in the in
structions given to the collier Nero,
â¢which is surveying the cable route
proposed by Rear Admiral Bradford.
This route avoids Wake Island,
which v/pf tf.kcn possession of by the

the laying 1 of a cable between Hono

edged to be American, which pos
sesses a hprbor capable, with slight
improvements, of accommodating
vessels of light draught.
The distance between Honolulu
and Midway is 1160 miles. The prop
osition was then to connect Midway
and Marcus Island, 1500 miles apart,
with Guam, the next cable station be
ing only 840 miles distant from Mar

Marcus Island is 1000 miles from
Yokohama and was placed by the
United States man-of-war Tuscarora

CALIFORNIA
ARE DELAYED
AT MANILA
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, May 23.â The departure of
the First California Infantry for home
has been prevented by a typhoon. The
rainy season in fact has already fairly
begun.
Major Bell of the Fourth Cavalry to
day made a reconnoissance at Santa
Rita, west of Bacolod. He encountered
considerable resistance from the enemy
and had several men wounded.
There was also a brush with the
enemy at Mariquina and later at Pa
say, where a line of insurgent skir
mishers who were shielding a force of
trench diggers attacked General Oven
shine's lines. The rebels were repulsed
by a battalion of the First Idaho In
fantry and two companies of the Twen
tieth Infantry. The Americans had two
men killed and two wounded.
These attacks upon the American
forces to-day, while Aguinaldo's com
missioners are in Manila negotiating
for peace are held to show a lack of
control of the rebel chiefs over their
followers and the futility of negotia
tions while armed rebels still keep the
field.
Recent events and negotiations for
peace have not brought about any
change in the American military policy.
So long as rebels appear in arms they
will be attacked and dispersed.
The railway tracks have been re
paired and the first train reached San
Fernando this morning.
The Spanish newspaper, Oceania, has
been suppressed by the military au
thorities and the editor arrested, for
publishing objectionable articles.
Two battalions of the Sixth Artillery
and 260 marines arrived here from San
Francisco to-day. Brigadier General
Williston, who arrived In command of
the Sixth Artillery, will succeed Gen
eral Hughes as provost marshal of
Manila. General Hughes has been as
signed, to duty in the Yisayan Islands.

TO CO ON FIGHTING
Filipino Leaders Believe They Can
Get Better Terms by Continu
ing the War.
Special Cable to The Call and the New Tor*
Herald. Copyrighted, IVM. by James Gor
don Bennett.
MANILA, May 23.â The
Filipino Commissioners
called early to-day upon
General Otis, but made no offi
cial propositions relative to sur
render. They met the American
Commission later and held four
hours' conference.
It is said that the Filipinos
were dismayed at the terms of
fered in President McKinley's
cablegram. Gregorio del Pilar
turned red under his brown skin
when he realized that he was be
ing offered nothing but vague
promises of possible representa
tion for his people in case of
compliance with the American
demand that they lay down
arms.
Every Filipino shrugged his
shoulders as the glowing prophe
cies of the future after the cessa
tion of hostilities were outlined
to them by the members of our
commission. They said that they
asked for independence and lib
erty with dignity, under the pro
tection of the United States, and
were now offered nothing but the
indefinite assurance that individ
ual natives might hold some offi
cial positions under the proposed
government. The native Com
missioners have great dread of fu
ture Congressional action. They
will accept not a single condition
of those proposed, but will re
turn dissatisfied to Aguinaldo
and report.
Major Zailcita, one of the Fili
pino Commissioners, said: "As
the ultimate form of government
rests in the hands of the Ameri
can Congress, the present pro
posals are merely provisional.
The result of the present plan
I would be that Americans would
be at the head of every depart
ment of government, as the Fili
pinos' tenure of office would de
pend on the will of the Ameri
! cans. We think we can get bet
ter, terms."
A leading banker of Manila
jsays: "The present proposals
are only a repetition of the provi
; sions of the American commis
i sion's proclamation. That means
, that this is an American colony.
You have adopted an imperialis
tic policy, then why talk over
j matters with the envoys of a hos
tile force which must be crushed
before such a government as is
proposed can be established?
"The opinion of military offi
cials is that the negotiations
merely encourage the insurgents
to hold out for better terms, espe
cially since the commading
American general is not con
! suited. General Luna is bound
to continue to fight for indepen
dence. Negotiations which en
courage the natives to hope to
obtain great concessions may
cost the lives of many American
soldiers."
OTIS OPPOSED TO
CONCILIATORY MEASURES

Will Mean Trouble in the
Future.
MANILA, May 23.â The Filipino
Commissioners spent the day at the
residence of the American Commis
sioners. Thpy discussed every point
of the scheme of government and the
peace proclamation details, asking for
information as to what personal rights

FRUIT GROWERS DECIDE
TO FORM A NORTHERN
CALIFORNIA EXCHANGE
SACRAMENTO, May rfâ The State
convention of fruit growers
closed its session to-night at the
Assembly chamber, after having
resolved upon forming a protect
ive organisation, to be known as the
Northern California Fruit Growers'
Exchange. The organization will op
erate along the lines followed by the
Southern California Fruit Exchange.
Organization of the State convention
was effected this morning by the elec
tion of Russ D. Stephens of Sacra
mento as chairman and B. M. Lelong,
secretary of the State Board of Horti
â¢ uiture, as secretary. There were in at
tendance about 100 of the best known
nrchardists of California north of the
Tehachapi.
The session, which resulted to-night
in such a definite determination to or
ganize, opened inauÃpiciously this
morning. When the long-looked-for
I-'tter from the Southern Pacific Com
pany was read, to most of the dele
gates the subject of refrigeration, of
h hiih it treated, was no more glacial
than the tone of the communication.
It was polite enough, but the politeness
was of the shivery sort, reminiscent of
an undertaker in action, and the silence
which followed its reading was pro
foundly funereal. In effect it re
proached the fruit growers for "not ap
preciating a good thing when it was
"ffered to them, and gave them slight
encouragement in their present pur
pose to fight the refrigerator combina
tion.
<'hairman Stephens informed the
(.invention that he had written a let
ter to William Sproule, freight traffic
manager of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, in which he asked these ques
tions:
Firstâ ls the Southern Pacific Company
prevented by any arrangements with the
Kruit Growers' Express and the Conti
nental Fruit Express from permitting any
competing line of refrigerator cars enter
ing California and competing for ship
ments of green fruit, and. if not, will the
company extend to one or more Eastern
refrigerator lines the same facilities en
joyed by the existing lines for getting
business in this territory?
Secondâ lf the fruit growers of Califor
nia decide to establish an independent car
line and perfect an organization for that
purpose, will the Southern Pacific haul
their cars, and on what terms and condi
tions?
Thirdâ Will the Southern Pacific supply
a proper and sufficient equipment of ven
tilator cars?
rthâ lf the company has not a suf
â  I equipment of ventilator car 6to
the wants of the growers, will it
i convert cars for that purpose?
Firthâ lf so how so. in will the com
l'.-iti> . undertake to furnish the cars re
quir< .'1 ?
aâ What is the Southern Pacific
willing to do in the direction of inaugu
rating an expedited ventilator train ser
â¢hrough ogdcn or more easterly
points?
Seventhâ Will the company haul and
give the same service and time to ventil
ator cars that has been given to refrig
erator cars?
In his reply, which Mr. Stephens
made public at the same time, Freight
Traffic Manager Sproule calls the at
tention of Mr. Stephens to the fact
that his company could not be charged
with the introduction of the refrig
erator plan of transportation, except
in so far as it had yielded to the rep
zesentations of the shippers and grow
ers, accepting as a matter of course
their verdict in favor of the refriger
ator system. The letter then reminds
the orchardists that â
For several years the fruit moved In
ventilated fruit cars built by the carriers
especially for the traffic and furnished
without expense to those who desired to
load them. Shippers were not satisfied
with the ventilated car. whether run on
regular freight trains or on special fast
trains, and Insisted that only under re
frigeration could California's fruit be sirc
illy placed in Eastern markets. Still
there were some who in convention and
In- person expressed themselves as certain
that the transportation in ventilated cars
could be made successful, and in express
compliance with these representations this
company added to its ventilator equip
ment TOO double-walled, paper-lined ven
tilated cars, which embodied all the val
uable points In construction and ventilat
ing appliances developed by experience.
mission explained that they would be ]
the- same as under the United States
constitution. The Filipinos also desired
information as to the school system to
be established, and approved of the
American policy of the separation of
church, and state.
They chiefly objected to the scheme
OB the ground that It gave them per
sonal liberty, which they know they
would have, but did not give them po
litical liberty.
Finally the Filipinos said they were
personally pleased with the plan, but
could not indorse it officially.
During the day the Filipino Commls-
Btonera called upon General Otis, and
th'-y will repeat their call to-morrow, j
There Is much comment here on the j
outing the Filipino envoys are enjoy- j
ing. They are arrayed in blue coats, '
scarlet trousers and gold lace, and i
drive about the city, reveling in the j
attentions bestowed on them, which is
evidently exceedingly gratifying to
them. They are the centers of contin
ual leveee at Filipino houses, where
they have been entertained and have
had every opportunity to advance the
interests of the Insurrection.
Military sentiment disapproves of the
Filipinos being lionized by their civil
ian element. General Otis, from ante
bellum experience and knowing the
Filipino's fondnesÃ for discussion, has
maintained the attitude he assumed
with the first Commission. He has
had no offer to make the Filipinos j
pave that they lay down their arms
without terms. The army believes that
if we intend to remain in the Philip- i
pine Islands it will be cheaper in the I
long run to whip the insurgents bo \
thoroughly that they would be glad of j
the opportunity to surrender, rather
than parley with them and make terms !
which they would construe as a com
promise.
The army is also of the opinion that
while the first course may cost more
men and more money in the begin
ning than the latter, it will prove an
effectual damper upon future insurrec
tions-, whereas if the war is ended by
a compromise the professional revolu- |
tionists among the Tagallos may be
encouraged to try again in a few years, j
Professor Schurman, speaking of the
commission's policy, said:
"I believe force was necessary be
cause they thought us weaklings and
cowards: but I believe also that con- i
filiation should accompany force. My !
endeavor has been, ever since I came :
here, to exercise conciliation."
The professor is most optimistic as
to the results of the negotiations, and
believes the scheme of government pro- i
posed by the United States Commission
will ultimately be adopted.

RUSS D. STEPHENS.
These cars were, as always before, placed
at Bhlppers' disposal without charge, but
the issue proved that the expectation of
handling the business in ventilated cars
was not well founded, and they wore not
used, but the business for which they
were built moved instead in refrigerators.
For this company it was a costly experi
ment, made in sincere effort to meet the
views of the fruit growers, under promise
in convention that the cars would be us"<l.
Our ventilated equipment so provided has
consequently since been converted into
boxcars, and there is no changed condi
tion with respect to transportation In v n
tilated cars that would warrant the car
riers in restoring at great expense equip
ment which has failed to stand the te?t
of experience and been discarded by the
growers and shippers.
Continuing -the letter of the freight
traffic manager says that the present
refrigerator system of transportation
began in 1888; that at that time the
charges for refrigeration were from $60
to $100 per car higher than now; that
owing to reasons with which his com
pany was not concerned one refrigera
tor company after another dropped out;
that last year three lines of refrigera
tor cars were provided, but out of some
4700 cars of fruit shipped all but a
hundred or so were loaded in the cars
of the Fruit Growers' Express and Con
tinental Fruit Express. The letter
further states that the centralization
of fruit in these two refrigerator lines
caused the railroad company to follow
the lead of the shippers and engage
from the Fruit Growers' Express and
Continental Fruit Express all the re
frigerators needed for the traffic.
The letter then directly answers the
questions of Mr. Stephens in this wise:
Our response to your first and second
question? consequently is that we have
contracted for all the refrigerator cars
-ary for the deciduous fruit traffic.
Were we to accept special line? of r^frlg
ernt'irs in the endeavor to satisfy the va
rious and often conflicting interests of
those promoting individual car line? we
would have so many refrigerators on the
line and under such variety of ausp
that serious confusion would develop, to
gether with a multitude of cars for which
there .would be no loads. â¢ * â¢
As to the remaining <iuestions your let
ter recites, new ventilated cars could not
be obtained, at this late date, and we have
companied by an insurgent captain, ;
called upon Major General Otis to-day i
and announced that he desired to sur- i
render his person and property into the
hands of the Americans.
The surrender was arranged by '
Chaplain Pierce of the Fourteenth Reg
iment, who knew Rosario before the
war. Rosario has been closely watch
ed by the officials at Tarlac since the 1
insurrection has been weakening, and j
only escaped by persuading General !
Luna to send him on a secret mission
to -Manila for the purpose of collecting
funds. With the captain are ten men
and their families. Rosario traveled at
night through the swamps and moun- j
tains, passed the lines of both armies
and entered Manila last evening. He
has been liberated on parole.
According to the story told by Ro
sario, General Luna is absolute dicta
tor and Aguinaldo fears him. Every
Filipino leader, it is added, suspects
the others of treachery.
The recent meeting of the Filipino j
congress was to secure a new cabinet, j
and the question of peace was not for- j
mally considered, as the members fear- i
ed General Luna's displeasure. The
Filipino government was unable to se- I
cure a Secretary of the Treasury. All |
those who were offered the portfolio
declined to accept it.

of the war with Spain:

BRUTAL TREATMENT OF
THE YORKTOWN'S MEN
NEW YORK, May 21. -The Manila cor
respondent of the Journal cables an In
teresting interview with General Lawton
regarding the campaign. General Lawton
gives the first information about the
shocking manner in which the men from
the Yorktown have been treated by their
Filipino captors. He found melancholy
evidences, when he captured San Isldro,
that the American prisoners had been
cruelly abused and subjected to outra
geous indignities at the hands of Aguin
aldo's barbarous soldiers.
After thirty days' successful campaign
ing Lawton is resting with 6000 men at
Candaba. He said in describing his vic
torious march of a' month's duration:
"II pained me when v. - c got into San
Isidro to Bee on the walls of the prison
th^rf the names of the fifteen Americans
frum the Yorktown.
"From Colonel Ray, the Spanish officer
whnm we rescued, I learned that one of
the American prisoners. escaped from his
ci'.j'Uire. His freedom was short-liven, fur
he wns afterward recaptured. He was
stretched on the ground before his fellow
prisoners and twenty hishes were given

written by one of the Yorktown's crew,

none of the ventilated fruit cars for
merly in the service, except such as is
necessary for our strictly local business.
We cannot take them out of the local and
put them into the through traffic, because
in the through traffic they would make
two. possibly three, trips- in the season,
whereas in the local traffic they make
many trips and are used continuously.
The letter closed with deprecatory
reference to the present agitation, the
freight manager appearing; to believe
that such a movement would hurt the
fruit season which, he said, promised
such rich returns.
It was not long after the correspond
ence had been made public that the
fruit growers renewed their resolution
to go ahead and organize, whether the
prospect as regarded the railroad's at
titude was hopeful or not. Edward
Berwick of Monterey urged the grow
ers to can and dry their fruit and ship
none at all until conditions were
changed. H. L. GibhÃ a fruit shipper
from Stockton, who said he was a for
mer employe of the Earl Fruit Com
pany, asserted that a conspiracy was
on foot by that and other companies
to ruin the growers. J. N. Barton of
Loomis said if the growers would or
ganize this year they would be free
from slavery next year. ffi^P
A. R. Sprague, president of the
Southern California Deciduous Fruit
Exchange, declared that the railroad
was just as willing to deal with the
growers as it waÂ« with Porter and Earl
provided the growers were organized
on business principles. He urged the
grow of the north to organize along
the same lines as the exchan*" 1 of
which he was the head. Other, orchard
ists spoke in the same strain and a
number of letters were read from
growers unable to be present, in which
they urged thorough organization.
When the report of the committee
favoring organization was presented
there was much enthusiasm, and in a
few minutes $300 was raised with which
to carry on the preliminaries.
To-night the convention adjourned
after discussing details and directing
that the work of incorporating the
Northern California Fruit Exchange be
proceeded with at once.
Baying that they were betn^ kicked, their
hair pulled out and that they were cruelly
treated in various other ways, and pray

their release.
"The insurgents make a practice of
murdering Chinese who fall into Lneir
hands, and our men, I suppose, should
consider themselves fortunate they have
not been similarly treated, though the
cruelties and Indignities heaped upon
them must, be hard to bear."

PRINCE McCLURG
WINS THE DERBY
Favorite Takes Latonia
Classic.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI. May 33.â More than 10.000 peo
ple crowded the Le-tonia course to-day to see
the Derby run. The weather was delightful
and the track In perfect Hhape. Prince Mc-
Clurg. the favorite, won the big event without
a struggle. Deering was second, one length In
front of Ways and Means, which was coupled
In the betting with His Lordship as J. D.
Smith's entry. The time was 2:36Vfc. The win
ner's share of the purse amounts to $6925. Wil
lie Beauchamp rode Prince McClurg, but it re
quired no great effort on the boy's part to win.
Prince McClurg was the beet horse and was
running easily when he crossed the wire.
Starter Chlnn had a hard time getting the
field lined up and when the flag dropped it was
to a fair start only. Leo Planter at once shot
to the front and opened a gap of two lengths.
His Lordship was second, a head in front of
Eberhart. The latter moved up to the throat
latch of Leo Planter and the two raced like a
team to within three-eighths of a mile from
home, when they faltered and fell back beaten.
Prince McClurg thpn showed in front and was
on thr bit the rest of the way. Deerlng, which
had been lying far behind the field, came
through with a wild burst of speed and beat
the badly tiring Ways and Means for the place.
Leo Planter was fourth, Eberhart a distant
fifth and His Lordship was beaten off.

DIVER SAYS THE
PARIS IS DOOMED
Believes That the Attempt to
Float the LiQer Will Be
Unsuccessful.
Â© FALMOUTH, Eng., May 23.â A leading Cornish diver who returned Â£
8? here to-night from the Paris takes a very pessimistic view of the SS
* prospect for saving the liner. He said: Â£g
Â§ "I do not expect that the Paris will be refloated. She is pierced <%
6 by rocks amidships, her foreholds are badly damag-ed, the bulkheads are *8
Â§Â§ practically useless, and even if she were got off the rocks I believe she 2
M would sink. In my opinion the only remedy is a false bottom, which it ct
g would take a month to complete, and I believe that even moderately ib
g rough weather in the meantime would break up the ship."
S Everything is in readiness for to-morrow's effort to float the vessel $
n if the weather continues favorable. 88
8? Another diver reports that the Paris has sustained heavy damage p
S from her bow to a point seventy feet aft, but he thinks the principal
j| damage is inside the double-bottom. gÂ»

Dr Jordan spoke of the changes which
were taking place about the university
and of the plans which were being con
sidered for the future. By the recent sale
of property Mrs. Stanford had been able
to put a large amount of money into the
university, as was shown by the new
buildings now being erected. The assem
bly hall had been accepted and the li
brary the gift of Thomas Welton Stan
ford' was well under way. A change
would be made in the buildings, however,
in regard to roofing.
The present roofing, which was a tin
imitation of tiling, would be replaced, he
said by the genuine article, which was
used' in'all other university buildings. The
memorial arch, which was being erected,
would join the assembly hall. To the east
of the new library building would be con
structed for the use of the history, eceon
omics and English departments. Mrs.
Stanford had made every effort to obtain
plans for the new chapel, which will make
ft the most imposing of any college
structure in the United States.
Long rows of Japanese lanterns were
suspended from the arcades of the quad
to-night. The shrubbery and flower beds
were brilliantly lighted and the moon
hung on the edge of dark clouds, which
swept slowly across the sky. The scene
was one of beauty. It. was the night of
the senior promenade. In the center of
the quad, on a stand built for the occa
sion. Bennet's band from the city dis
coursed sweet music. Even,' conceivable
nook was partitioned off and formed into
booths by the young ladies, who there re
ceived their friends and served them with
refreshments as they lounged about on
the divans.

FRENCH PREJUDICE
TOWARD AMERICA
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, May 23.
An example of the manner In which
anti-American prejudice is formed in
some portions of Europe has been
brought to the attention of the State
Department in the issue of Le Petit
Marseillaise of Marseilles, France, of
the 7th inst. This paper contains a
full-page illustration, in garish colors,
representing a young girl undergoing
punishment by the whip in America.
The two prominent figures in the pic
ture are the girl, who is undergoing
public flogging, and the Sheriff. The
latter is a tall figure, wearing a red
shirt and black trousers, his right arm,
with which he is wielding a cruel lash,
bared to the elbow, while the girl stands
with her arms in the stocks and body
bare to the hips, receiving the blows
from the whip. The chastisement is
witnessed, apparently with enjoyment,
by a miscellaneous assemblage of old
men, young girls and little children, all
well dressed, while a number of soldiers
stand in the background to support the
proceeding with the official authority of
the United States Government. Ex
plaining the illustration the Marseillaise
says :
"In a country like America, where one
is accustomed to find only progress and
new discoveries, one is very much sur
prised to see a turn backward like pun
ishment by the whip. This retrograde
movement is performed in the State of
Virginia, in which the Legislative Assem
bly has voted a law permitting the ap
plioation of corporal chastisement in pub
lic.
"The first person upon whom this pun
ishment has been inflicted is a young girl
of 18 years of age, who was whipped on
the public square of Manasas.
"If one did not notice the modern dress
of the crowd which was present at the
scene, in the presence of the Sheriff and
representatives of the public force, he
would have thought himself in the mid
dle ages on seeing the^ unhappy girl, naked
to the waist, both hands held in a piece
of plank, while the executor of the law
acquitted himself conscientiously of his
mission."
It is only necessary to say that pun
ishment by flogging is not authorized
by the laws of Virginia, and that the
illustration is purely imaginary.
SUDDEN DEATH OF
CONVICT VASQUES
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, May 23.â The
prison officials are sorely perplexed over
the death at 4 o'clock this morning of
Mose Vrisques, who expired in his cell just
as the prison physician reached the bed
side. Yas<iues for the pact week has been
at work with the road gang employed in
the building of the Tiburon boulevard.
Yesterday afternoon, while unloading
gravel from a construction car, he lost
consciousness and fell to the ground. He
was picked up and carried to the shade
of a tree, where he immediately revived.
He resumed work and nothing was
thought of the incident.
Vasques returned to the prison in ap
parently good health. He was locked up
with the other prisoners as usual and is
not known to have complained of feeling
ill. This morning as the cooks and din
ing room men were released from their
cells groans were heard from Vasques'
cell. A rap at the door brought no re
sponse, and Dr. Lawlor, the prison phy
sician, was summoned. When Lawlor
reached the prisoner's bedside Vasques
was found to be dying and he expired a
few moments later. The Coroner held
an inquest this morning. The jury re
turned a verdict of death from natural
causes.
Vasques has spent much' of his time in
the hospital since his incarceration, being
treated for a pulmonary complaint. The
Vasques family is notorious in the crim
inal annals of this State. At one time
there were the father and three sons at
San Quentin. The father. Mates Vas
ques, died in the penitentiary. The fam
ily was implicated in a number of rob
beries in the southern part of the State
where its name was a terror to stage
drivers and travelers.

Special Dispatd) to The Call.
>AX DIEGO, May 23.â The continued
reports from thet 'erro Pinta plaoer
S, 400 miles south of this city, in
Lower California, have started a rush |
from this end of the State. The steam- i
er St. Denis sailed at 8 o'clock to-night
for Ensenada, where it will connect
to-morrow with the steamer Carlos Pa
0, which goes direct to Ascension I
arriving there on Friday. The j
of the placer digging Is twelve to j
n miles inland from Ascension.
The Pach cannot carry all the
â  assengers, freight, mules and burros
awaiting at Ensenada for trans
tion to the placers, as preference 1

Many Mexicans and others at Ense

of getting to the diggings by ;
way of the ocean route, and are pre
paring to go overland. The overland
trip is, however, very tedious and try
ing, the roads not being good and the
distance over the mountains being
about JOO miles. I'.y far the best way '
to reach the placers is by steamer or
other vessel to Ascension, or one of tho '
:â  two or three small bays in the
vicinity. This entails no hardships
and the cost is small.
Tlw fare paid by the men who sailed
to-ni?ht was $16 each to Ascension,
and this allows them to take about
200 pounds of luggage, which, of course,
invariably includes their dry washer,
provisions and blankets. Some of the

GAGE DEFENDS HIS
POCKET VETO OF
SUFFRAGE BILL
LOS ANGELES. May 23.â Governor
Gage has written a letter to Dr.
Stephen Bowers, editor of the
California Voice, explaining why he
vetoed Assembly bill No. 438, which
conferred the ballot upon women at
school elections.
First, the Governor declares the act
Is clearly in violation of article 2, sec
tion 1, of the constitution of California,
which reads as follows:
Every native male citizen of the United
States, every male person who shall have
acquired the rights of citizenship under
or by virtue of the treaty of Queretaro,
and every male naturalized citizen hereof,
who shall have become such ninety days
prior to any election, of the age of 21
years, who shall have been a resident of
the State one year next preceding the
election, and of the county in which he
claims his vote ninety days, and in the
â¢â¢lection precinct thirty days, shall he en
titled to vote at ull elections which are
now or may hereafter be authorized by
[aw; provided, no native of China, no
Idiot, no Insane person, no person con
victed of any infamous crime, no person
hir>'after convicted of the embezzlement
or misappropriation of public money, and
no person who shall not be al>l^ to read
the constitution in the English language
and write his name, shall ever everclse
the privileges of an elector in this State;
provided, that the provisions of this
amendment relative to an educational
qualification shall not apply to any per
son prevented by a physical disability
from complying with its requisitions, nor
to any person who now has the right to
vote, nor to any person who shall be 60
years of age and upward at the time this
amendment shall take effect. (Amend
ment ratified at election of November tl,
1894. 1
Governor (Jape says:
The mere fact that the act itself at
tempts to limit the officers for whom
women may vote dues not render it less
â  stitutional, because the right of
suffrage is denied by the constitutional
provision just referred to generally; and
an act of the Legislature would be void
which would attempt to permit the exer
cise of that right in a special case. The
Supreme Court of this State, in the case
of Van Volkenberg vs. Brown, 43d Cali
fornia Reports, page 4:!. decided that
woman was not entitled to the right of
suffrage.
The provision of the old constitution,
in bo far as II used the words "male citi
zen of the United States" was similar to
article 11, Bection I, of the present con
stitution. The court, on page 51 of the re
port above referred t... says: "A State

BOOMING WHITE
FOR THE SENATE
His Declination Wiil Be
Ignored.
Special Dispatch to Thp Call.
IX>S ANGELES. May 23.â Stephen M.
White Is to be the Democratic candidate
for United States Senator in the event of
no special session of the present Legisla
ture being held to till the vacancy In the
office. Senator White's friends in this city
are engaged in laying the wires in his mi
.-rest before the Democratic S!;tt<> con
vention to be held next year. The party
era in this end "f the State are a
unit for White, who is to be indorsed by
- the State convention, no matter how
miich h>- may protest.
The Senator insists that he is averse
to making another contest and declares
that he does not desire the honor, even
should the place come to him without
a contest. The party managers, however,
say he must accept the position, and they
will get Into hie light, no matter what
may he his own inclinations.
All factions of the Democratic party In
Ix)S Angeles claim to he for White, who
Is to he first Indorsed hy the county con
vention and the earlier primaries next
spring. A soliil delegation for the Bena
tor will go from here to the State con
vention.
In the State convention the issue is to
he a plank in the State platform pledging
the party to Senator White's election
without a contest in the event of the
election of a Democratic Legislature, next
year. The Senator had such a contest
ten years ago, when he won handily. He
i desired the United States Senatorship at
that time. The party, however, lost the
j legislature that year and the Senator's
1 ambition was temporarily delayed.
It was feared at one time that former
ernor James Budd had an eye out for
i the Senatorship and intended next year to
contest the leadership of the party with
j Senator White. Should Budd still be of
' that frame of mind when the State con
vention meets next year he is to be given
i the fight of his life.
Senator R. F. Del Valle is an ardent
; White enthusiast, and he is to head th<-
I os Angeles County delegation next year
In Senator White's Interest. Senator Del
Valle will make a tight for a White reso
lution in the State platform, and he
i claims to have no fear of the result, no
matter what combination may be made.
Senator White also will probably head
1 the delegation from this State nexi year
to 'h (> National Convention. His asso

LIFE IMPRISONMENT
FOR JUSTIN BROWN
Slayer of Cain Found Guilty of Mur
der in the First Degree at
Bakersfield.
BAKERSFIELD, May 23.â "We, the
jury, find the defendant guilty of murder
in the first degree and recommend his
punishment at life imprisonment."
This was the verdict of the jury in
the Brown murder case. It was returned
at 6:15 this evening, after the jury had
been out an hour and a quarter. After re
turning to jail Brown remarked:
"That's a long time Lo spend in prison. I
guess the jury did what they thought was
right. I've got it and can't do anything."
Justin Brown is 27 years of age. He
had the friendship of Mrs. Cain, the
widow of his victim, throughout the trial.
She is 37 years old and is the mother of
five children, the eldest. 17 years of age.

The rjghts of office and suffrage are po
litical purely, rind are denied by some
nr all the States to part of their popu

A tain on page 53 of the same report of
the case last referred to, the court says:
"The mere power of the State to deter
mine the class of inhabitants who may
vote within her limits was not curtailed
in the fourteenth amendment. The fif
teenth amendment took away her au
thority to discriminate against citizens of
the United States on account of either
rare, color or previous condition of servi
tude; b\it the power of exclusion upon all
other grounds, including that of sex, re
mains intact."
In the case of Spier vs. Baker, 120 Cali
fornia Reports, page 376. the Supreme
court, speaking of the right of the Legis
lature to regulate the political rights of
its citizens, says: "That is. the Legisla
ture has attempted to extend the right
of suffrage to certain classes of citizens
outside of those classes mentioned in the
constitution. If the Legislature "has Buch

of the right. The application of the max
im 'expressio unius est exclusio alter
ius' bears with full force upon this pro
vision of the constitution, declaring who
are competent to vote at elections au
thorized by the laws of this State."
In the case of Spencer vs. the Board of
Registration, Ist McArthur. page 169, aris
ing in the District of Columbia, it was
held- by the court that the right of suf
frage is not guaranteed by the United
States constitution to women, and the
court says: "Whfle the conditions of
right have varied in several States and
from time to time been modified in the
same State, the right has uniformly rest
ed upon the express authority of the polit
ical power and been made to revolve with
in the limitations of express law."
Again, in Mino vs. iiappersett, 21 Wal
lace, page IM, the Supreme Court of the
United States, passing upon the question
of woman's right to suffrage, under the
provisions of the constitution of Missouri,
denying that right, held that there was no
inherent right to vote by reason of
woman's mere citizenship and that the
constitution of the State of Missouri, con
fining the right of suffrage to men, was
not in vplation of the I'nited States con
stitution, and that the fourteenth amend
ment to the United States constitution
had no application to the subject of suf
frage The court, in ;â  review of the ques
tion In conclusion says:
"As has been seen, all thp citizens of the
States were not vested with the right of
suffrage. In all save perhaps New Jer
sey this right was only bestowed upon
men, and not upon all of them. Under
these circumstances it is certainly now
too late to contend that a Government is
not republican within the meaning of the
guaranty In the constitution because
women ' are not mad.' voters. â¢ * *
Women were excluded from suffrage in
nearly all the States by thp express pro
vision of the constitution and laws."
In conclusion the Governor comments
as follows:
These are a few of the most objection
able reasons which presented themselves
to me at the time of the submission of
the bill for action. I therefore felt it my
duty under the law to refuse to sign a
bill' which was clearly invalid, and which,
moreover, would not have reached the
end desired. ,
In view of what has been hereinbefore
stated, you will readily sec that permit
ting the' exercise of suffrage by females
in respect to school matters could result
in great financial harm to the various
School districts, touching the validity of
their bonds by reason of the doubt as to
their constitutional right to act. As be
fore indicated, I have not here at
tempted to go Into all the details which
Influenced my judgment in the premises,
but from tlie foregoing I am satisfied
that you will coincide thormighlv with
the accuracy of my position. Yours very
respectfully, HENRY T. GAGE.

COAST LINE TO
BE COMPLETED
All Obstacles Are Now
Removed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA. May 23.â 1t now
seems that all obstructions to the com
pletion of the Coast road have been dis
posed of. Some time ago L. G. Dreyfus
announced that a satisfactory agreement
had been made with him by the Southern
Pacific Company. To-day the last of the
obstructionists, the Hollister estate, was
placated. The arch that the Hoilisters
demanded from the railroad company in
front of their ranchhouse (there is a long
fill of forty-two feet directly in front of
the ranch buildings, obstructing the view
and necessitating a grade in order to' get
out of the ranch), and which Superinten
dent Hood estimated would cost $4400, is
to be put in. Hood In his figures evidently
made a mistake and upon investigation
it is ascertained that the cost will not
exceed $2i.iou. The company will agree to
build this and the Hoilisters will grant
the right of way for a distance of .twenty
seven miles through their ranch.
These farts were made known at to
day'a railroad mass-meeting, called by
Hon. Ellwood Cooper. The opera-house
was crowded by property-owners along
the coast line and delegates from the sev
eral counties. Hon. Marion Cannon, ex
rongressniiin from this district, led the
delegates from the outside counties.
Chairman Ellwood Cooper made a short
address, in which he outlined the purpose
of the meeting. He said:
This call has not for its object the increase
of the income of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, but it is to help ourselves. If we want
the "railroad, we want it quickly; and as intel
liKent business men we should do everything in
our power to insure rapid work. If we stop
I*, consider the circumstances or motives that
have induced the railroad company to build
this line, or reflect upon past grievances,
whether they be real or imaginary, we make a
serious mistake. These questions are beyond
our power to know. VW do know, however,
what our duty is, and that is to do everything
in our power to Insure the completion at the
earliest possible moment. Our interests do not
slop even at the completion of the gap. We
will want accommodation facilities to trans
port our products, passenger accommodations,
the good will of the company, harmony In all
our dealings with them. The company is, mi
the ground with all the paraphernalia for rapid
work: it Ib ready to place camps on every
ranch where there Is much work to be done,
and to push It to every extent with a reason
able degree of economy. We must bestir our
selves to insure these facilities.
Ex-Congressman Cannon, hearing that
the people of Santa ISarbara County Itad
agreed to give the Southern Pacific Com
pany a free right of way through the
entire county and including free depot
sites and other such privileges was much
surprised and perplexed. He thought the
company was now receiving too much
from the citizens. He spoke at some
length. A committee of five property
owners was appointed and given power
to investigate and if possible settle all
grievances on the part of property hold
ers along the line. After a greal deal
of discussion the following resolution was
adopted:
Resolved That we. the citizens of the city
and â¢ ounty "t Santa Barbara, in convention
assembled this 23.! day of May. 1899, hail with
pleasure and unfeigned satisfaction the deter

Hawaiian Cabinet Reconsiders Appli
cations of Planters.
HONOLn.r. May 16.â The Cabinet held
a meeting this morning with the Bureau j
of Immigration. It was decided first of
all to reconsider the application of Bee
croft, Waialua, Onomea and Pioneer
mills for laborers. It was against these
estates that the Inspector of Immigrants
had filed objections either for sanitary j
reasons or for ill treatment of laborers by j
lunas. The decision was that upon a
shewing by those plantations that the
evils complained of had been remedied
the number of laborers required would be
permitted.
A regulation was made that in future
where reports of the Immigrant Inspector
were unfavorable for sanitary or other
reasons copies of such reports should be
furnished to the agents of the plantation,
with the Information that no other labor
ers would be permitted until the evils
were corrected. The lists of laborers were
looked over ;'tid 5311 were permitted for
the next period.

Barrera, a Mexican woman, was mur
dered in this city early this morning by
her rejected lover, Francisco Ochoa.
Ochoa shot and seriously wounded an
unoffending man named Smith, who
chanced to cross his path just before
he broke in the door of the woman's

The affair occurred in the tenderloin,
near the corner of L and Twenty-first
streets, at 1 o'clock this morning. Ochoa
and the woman had lived together for
some time. A month ago she cast him

Cutting's attorney is former Surr.j^.ii o

SEEK EQUITABLE
FREIGHT TARIFFS
Fight Waged by Coast
Jobbers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PAUL, Minn., May 23.âRepre
sentatives of the jobbing interests of
the Pacific Coast and the important
commercial centers of the Middle West
met in a conference in the Ryan Hotel
to-day, the result of which will greatly
affect transcontinental shipping busi
ness. The subject of discussion %vas
the transcontinental freight tariff put
into effect by the two northern roads
on May 1, which the Western men
claim will ultimately cause them se
vere loss. Jobbers of the Middle West,
<m the contrary, hold that they cannot
afford to see the tariff changed, and
the opposing factions are arguing the
matter before representative officials o-f
the Western roads. Two sessions were
held to-day, an adjournment without a
decision having been taken at 5 o'clock.
A third session will convene to-morrow
morning.
The coast jobbers represent that if
i the present tariffs are continued it will
ultimately result in curtailing their
trade. They desire a greater difference
| between carload and less than carload
rates and the prohibition of "mixed
carload" shipments. They maintain
'â  that unless a greater difference is made
j in carload and less than carload rates
they fuv certain to lose trade in their
immediate territory, to which they hold
I they are justly entitled.
The contest, though entirely friendly
between the representatives of the two
j interests, is nevertheless close and is
I being waged in earnest. Strong dele
gations were here from San Francisco,
Tacoma, Seattle arid other coast
I points to urge a change of tariff, while
| St. Louis, Chicago, St. Paul and Duluth
I were equally well represented by dele
gations intent upon securing the main
tenance <# the present freight rates.
About eighty jobbers in all were rep
resented. They were met in St. Paul
by J. M. Hannaford. vice president of
the Northern Pacific: Francis B.
Clarke, traffic manager of the Great
Northern; Freight Agent Somers of the
| Great Northern and other prominent
officials.

ALFRED AUSTIN'S
BIRTHDAY ODE
TO THE QUEEN
Verses by the Poet Laureate in
Honor of Victoria's Eightieth
Anniversary.
May 23.â T0-morrow, being the
I eightieth anniversary of the birth of Queen
I Victoria, the poet laureate of England, Alfred
I Austin, has written a birthday ode, entitled
I "An Indian Summer." A magnificently bound
I copy of the ode will be presented to Her Maj-
I esty to-morrow at Windsor.
Mr. Austin has given the privilege of exclu-
I sive publication of the ode in the United
I States to the New York Herald and the San
I Francisco Call. The work follows:
Springtime was flowering in your fair young face,
When first the scepter laid on you its load. . â¢
Springtime and seedtimeâ and how well you sowed:
'n the rough furrows life's long duties trace,
Scattering with lavish heart the smiles of youth and grace.
' Niu^h April sandaled with its flowers your f -
And sang its amorous descant In your ears,
You, with a for -slcrht wiser than your years,
'â  thought you of thf time, more Berlous, Bweet,
When mellow fruit is stored, and stacked is ripened wheat.
'â \';th heart as tender aa the bud h;ilf blown,
Yet in the very season ->f young love,
Kneeling, you sought i's imi ulse from above,
'noosing for consort of your earthly throne
. 3OU] akin t'> yours, a mind t<> match your own.
ilowed your summer o'er thf land,
You, with your people round, you could forecast
Rich fruitinc future planted in the past,
Bnga â  i^c of rule, rightly planned,
<>f freedom round your shores, and in the sea command.
Then Plowly comes the time when summers wane.
Ami from the sunshine something seems withdrawn
Aa pensive Bhadows lengthen on the lawn,
'i 'inly bindweed lingers in th< lane,
The one sweet thing that then unwithered doth remain.
But !here j? beauty In autumnal I'ough,
No less than In dear April's dewy leaves.
When, with its store "t' golden girdled sheaves
stands the -rain where one ti.ie passed the plni:^!.
fulfillment of its vow.
â¢ though the oblivious cuckoo calls
im land t.i land, ivr longer on the spray
yellowing <-\m the throstle vaunts his lay.
The ring-dove's mate, as fades the leaf and falls,
Reiterates note of love that never palls.
From hamlet roofs, blue spires of smoke once more â
\< dies the lay in mist alontf the dale,
And widowed evening wepps behind her veil â
From log-replenished ingle heavenward soar.
And lamps are early lit and early latched the door.
n it is less earthly than divine.
When love's rich guerdons -with the days increase
- are softened 'neath the crown of peace,
ail we have won 'twere easy to resign â
v season like to this, loved lady, now is thine.
Through life's successive labors, one by one,
Still moving on to-day, no more you roam.
Peeking fresh tasks, but fruit of harvest Iv.me,
Fruit blent with flowers, warmed by October's pun
Are round your throne entwined and harvest hymns begun.
what a harvest, lady, now is yours,
Empire and fame and glory, and above
Glory and fame a universe's love â
â¢ oted deep in reverence that insures
â iibrance of your name as long as time endures.
- may the Indian summer nf your days
linger in the land you love so well,
And long may we. who no less love you, dwell
In the reposeful radiance of your gaze,
A golden sunset seen through autumn's silvery haze.

HELPLESS BABE
EXPOSED TO THE
WIND AND BAIN
Brutal Act of a Mys
terious Stranger.
"Tmi ought to be lynched for keeping
that poor babe on the streets a night like
this," shouted Charlie Stuart at a well
dressed stranger who stood at the junc
tion of Market, Powell and Eddy streets
last night with a three months old baby
in his arms. He had been standing there
since S o'clock, and it was midnight when
Stuart, who Is a prominent traveling man,
accosted him. "I am waiting for my
wife," meekly replied the stranger, but
the nervous twitching at the corners of
his mouth and the cold look he gave the
baby when he uttered the few words gave
the'lie to his statement. The little suf
ferer was blue with cold and wet to the
skin, for the pitiless rain drops had been
beating down on its uncovered face since
9 o'clock. The child's soulful sobs at
tracted the attention of everybody who
passed, but the heartless wretch who held
it in his arms paid little heed to its wails.
The people coming from the theaters saw
the mysterious man with the crying babe
in his arms, and not a few of them, think
ing he was a beggar, slipped him change,
which he eagerly crammed into his
pockets.
Stuart, who had noticed the stranger
walking up and down Eddy street for an
hour or more, became enraged and or
dered him off the street under tho pen
alty of being arrested.
A crowd quickly gathered, and were it
not for the fact that the brute had the
I baby in his arms lie would have been
soundly thrashed. lie made his escape on
the Powell-street car. Stuart also beard
ed the car and rode as far as Ellis street,
: where he called a policeman. Stuart mi
i forme.l the policeman that the man had
kept the babe exposed in the rain for six
hours and then left the car. The police
man accompanied the stranger several
! blocks but did not get his name or place
I him under arrest.
Stuart will visit police headquarters to
day and swear out a "John Doe" warrant
I for the man's arrest.

Mayor Phelan Intimates That He
Will Use His Veto Against the
Latest Attempt to Rob
the Public.
Robbery perpetrated by the Market
etreet Railway Company is always a con
dition precedent to the endeavor to prove
an alibi. The crime has been continuous
for years. The attempt to shift the onus
was made Tuesday, when the Street Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors was
used as a stalking horse for a most out
rageous onslaught on an unsuspecting
public. After robbing its own stock*
holders by the use of methods that would
-call for the wiping: off the stock of the
company from any stock board in the
country, the Market-street Railway Com
pany is attempting to snmlbag the San
Francisco public Into such acquiescence
in the steal as will make it presentable in
a court of justice.
The particular n to is

Company sold something that it did not

ACTIVE WORK
IN BEHALF OF
DEWEY STATUE
The General Committee Fixes $100,000
as the Limit of Cost and Appoints
Sub=Committees.
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOL
LARS is the amount the committee
to erect a monument to the Ameri
can navy in commemoration of the
victory of Admiral Dew'ey at Manila has
fixed upon as necessary for its purpose,
and it will proceed at once to raise that
sum. That the committee will be suc
cessful there is not the slightest doubt.
Gratifying progress was made at the
meeting of the committee in Mayor Phe
lan's private office yesterday afternoon.
Besides the Mayor, who is chairman of
the committee, there were present: Irv
ing M. Scott, F. W. Van Slcklen, R. P.
Schwerin, Captain Fletcher, E. W. Hop
kins. Leon Sloss, Horace G. Platt. J. B.
ReiaÃ.ein, Charles L. Patton. C. H. Bund
shu.v'olonel Charles A. Murphy and E.
B. Pond. Little time was wasted in dis
cussion, the members getting right down
to work as soon as Mayor Phelan rapped
for order.
The first matter taken up was the elec
tion of treasurer. At the preliminary
meeting it was suggested that some bank
be selected to act in that capacity, but on
second consideration the members decid
ed that It would be preferable to have one
of their own number hjave control of the
funds, and ex-Mayor E. B. Pond was
unanimously chosen for the position.
The question of finances was then taken
up, the discussion extending to the cost of
the statue. . It was finally decided that
$100,000 would be ample to erect as im
posing and artistic a monument as could
be desired.
A resolution was adopted appointing a
committee of five to prepare and issue an
appeal to the people setting forth the in
comparable service rendered the entire
Pacific Coast by Dewey and his fleet and
the reasons why the public should honor
the great admiral in the manner proposed.
The address will be prepared to-day and
printed in all the papers to-morrow morn
ing.
A second committee was appointed to
wait upon the leading citizens of this city
and ascertain what financial assistance
they will give the movement, as it was
deemed advisable to start the fund with
some larce subscriptions before beginning
1893 or the act of 1897. Section 6S of the
consolidation act Is inconsistent with
â¢ and it therefore stands.
By authority of that section all ordi
nances granting special privileges or
franchises coming within that category
must be submitted to the Mayor. It may
be that bids art absurdly low for valu
able franchises. In that event it would
be my duty to return the order without
my approval.
"There is no disposition certainly on
â  my part to stand in the way of granting
reasonable franchises under ordinary <ir
cumstano s, but as the charter goes into
effect on the Ist of January, 1 think that
all franchiw s hereafter should be
granted under the provisions of that in
strument. 1 am disposed to believe that
when the present street railway fran
s hi San Francisco expire the people
will want to control the streets and the
! street transportation on their own ac
: count by municipal ownership, giving a
< very low rate of fare to passengers in
order to facilitate intercommunication
and thus build the city and bring the
suburbs within the reach of the mechanic
and the laborer. When the laborers were
working on the Dewey boulevard they had
to pay one-tenth of their day's earnings
to come and go to and from their work.
"The anxiety of the Geary Street Rail
way Company, controlled by the Market
I Street Railway, to secure a new franchise
is due. first, to a desire to avoid
the provisions of the new char
ter, which limits the term of a
franchise to twenty-five years and
provides that at the expiration of that
time the roadbed shall revert to the city;
and secondly, the company is in a diffi
culty, which reflects bad management or
bad'faith upon somebody. It is this:
"While the franchise expires in 1903. the
company has issued $Â»571 .0"Â»o worth of
bonds which do not mature until 1921, and
no provision, as T understand it, has been
made for a sinking fund. As a result the
bondholders, who must have bought
â  blindly, will have nothing to show for
' their Investment unless the same com
pany secures the franchise, in addition
to the bonds there is a million dollars'
worth of stock issued at $100 par value.
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL., WEDNESDAY, MAT 24, 1899.
a general canvass for funds. This com
mittee will report at a meeting to be held
Friday, at which time the general com
mittee will resolve itself into a commit
tee of the whole on subscriptions and
each member will be assigned to a dis
trict which he will be expected to thor
oughly canvass.
Still another committee was appointed
to wait upon the proprietors of the differ
ent newspapers In the city and have
them throw open their columns to sub
scriptions and have each business office
ect as a collection agency for the fund.
By so doing contributions from Interior
points can be sent in to any of the papers,
due. credit given to the sender, and the
money promptly turned over to the treas
urer. "
The dispatch from Admiral Dewey, in
which he stated that the proposition of
his fellow townsmen to erect a statue of
him to be placed beside thÂ«Â» statue of
Kihan Allen had been more gratifying to
him than anything that had yet been
suggested, was commented upon, and the
mcmhors of the committee felt that the
admiral would feel the same way in re
card to the movement on the Pacific
Coast.
Committees of five members each on
design, construction and location were
appointed and will begin work at once.
The committee on location bids fair to
have the most difficult task to perform,
for already letters are pouring in upon
the general committee offering sugges
tions as to the location of the statue and
giving reasons why the writer's views
should bo accepted above all others. That
committee is going to have an unhappy
time of it. It is evident, for the enthusi
asts have only just begun to get stirred
up over the proposition. There are many
thousands to be heard from, atid every
one will have to reinforce his first state
ment with succeeding letters.
One letter was received yesterday from
a Native Son containing a !"uggestion
that was immediately acted upon without
dissent. It was that the committee pre
pare an illuminated receipt to be given to
each contributor to the fund, which can
(â >â  kept as a souvenir. The committee
will havo prepared at once some designs
for ?u<ii receipt to be submitted at the
next meeting for approval. The receipt
$37 of which only was paid in. I cannot
see what value this has unless the fran
chise Is renewed. This reminds me that
the Market street railway stock has been
advancing- rapidly on its earning capacity,
whereas at the expiration of its several
franchises the bondholders will alone be
protected so far as an inadequate Finking
fund can protect them, and the stockhold
ers will get nothing-.
"I do not like to see this stock sold
freely on the market to Innocent pur
chasers, which enables the corporation
when it gets into trouble to cry that it is
owned by "widows and orphans.' I think
innocent purchasers should be warned.
"As for the Geary street franchise, you
will see from the facts that if the new
franchise be offered for sale the com
pany will have to secure it if it desires
to protect the bonds: or the bondholders
themselves will bid and hence the city
is in a position to get a good price for
it. provided some of our citizens will get
tog-ether and also make bids, which they
no doubt will do. But for my part 1 am
wllllnc to say that so far as I can pro
tect tnÂ» public in the matter the fran
chise wilf not be offered for sale until
after the first or the year, for the rea
sons abovÂ»Â» statM. I claim to have the
right to veto all orders of the Board of
Supervisors granting franchises and spe
cial privileges."
Another thing that will make the road
of the transgressor hard for the Mar
ket Street Company is the fact that it
has not relinquished It? Gearv street
franchise. It has gone to the Board of
Supervisors and asked it to grant a fran
chise over a line that until 1903 at least
is held from the public. It asks the
Board of Supervisors to grant a franchise
that will not be in the power of any
Board of Supervisors to grant until ISO 3.
True, it offers to surrender the franchise,
but it does so with a string. "If you give
us fifty yean for four, well trade." How
can the Market Street Railway and the
Board of Supervisors get over the fact
that there is nothing to give and tint if
there was the effort to steal twenty-five
years of life from one provision of the
new charter must prove abortive? It will
try to show It at the next meeting of the
Street Committee on Thursday. After
that, the Mayor.
The other attempts of the Market Street
Company to squeeze the city In its coils,
made at the same time as the applica
tion for the new Geary street franchise,
are no less insidious. A block here and
a block there it asks throughout the city,
ostensibly for the purpose of connecting
Its various lines, but absolutely for the
purpose of taking up at the minimum of
cost streets which if unhampered by
these petty franchises might prove de
sirable ways over which competing com
panies might desire to run lines. They
are all attempts at steals as is the Geary
street application and just as baldfaced.
They should all meet with the same fate.
It is up to Mayor Phelan to stop them
If Supervisors can be found willing
enough to cotintenance them.

The Sunnyside Republican Club last
night passed a unanimous resolution in
dorsing The Call for its action in promot
ing the erection of a statue to Admiral
Dewey to be placed in a commanding po
sition on the Pacific Coast on the shores
of the bay of San Francisco.
At a meeting of the Point .Lohos Im
provement Club last night a resolution
was introduced by Colonel C. H. Murphy,
who claims to be the originator of trie
Dewey statue. The resolution, which is
as follows, was unanimously adopted:
"Whereas. There is a public movement
on hand to erect a statue in this city to
the American navy to commemorate *Ad â 
miral Dewey's great achievement in Ma
nila: and whereas, said naval achieve
ment cleared the Pacific of a fleet that
menaced this coast, and opened the sea
to our commerce; and whereas, San
Francisco and other seaport cities of Cali
fornia are under exceptional obligations
to Admiral Dewey: therefore be it
'â¢Resolved. That the Point T>obos Im
provement Club, moved by sentiments of
gratitude and patriotism, commends this
movement and pledges its support to the
Major and the committee in charge of
said proposition: and be it further
"Resolved, That we highly regard this
project of the people's gratitude for our
national hero; be it further
"Resolved. That we believe it to be the
duty of all good citizens of California to
aid this movement by both moral and
financial assistance."
On the question of selecting a site for
the statue. Secretary YV. P, Johnston of
fered a resolution favoring Sutro Heights
as being the best adapted for the brave
Dewey. From this place it was held that
the statue would be one of the first ob
jects as also thp last seen by all coming
In or going: out of the Golden Gate.
Colonel Murphy had no doubt hut the
Sutra heirs would sell the heigrhts to the
city at a reasonable figure for such a pur
pose.
ROOKERIES ON
MARKET STREET
IN A BIG BLAZE
A Fire That Threat
ened Danger.
CAUSED BY CROSSED WIRES
FRIGHTENED LODGERS LEAVE
IN HOT HASTE.
A Bunch of Tottering Eyesores in
the Business Section Damaged
to the Extent of
$5000.
A fire which started in a mmiwt man
; nr>r and at first seemed insignificant
| threatened the very heart of the city be
' tween the hours of 11 and 12 o'clock last
nischt. At Market and Fourth streets
there are a number of old wooden build
ings, rickety and worm-eaten. The gTound
j floor stores, however, bring in a nice
! rental, and this is probably all that has
| saved them from being torn down and
replaced by modern structures. Last
night, shortly after 11 o'clock, the electric
! light wires became crossed at Fourth and
'â  Market streets. There was a sputtering
of flame on the pole and a sharp hissing
sound could be heard on the sidewalk.
A few minutes later smoke was seen
issuing from the roof of the three-story
frame structure at 7K3 Market street, and
an alarm was turned in from box 98.
When the firemen arrived they could only
locate a blind fire in the building, and
! they started in to fight it. The building
was but a tinder-box, however, and In a
â  few minutes flames were bursting from
' the roofs of the buildings at 3, 5, 9 and 11
I Fourth street. It looked for a time as
though a second alarm would be neces
sary, but the firemen finally managed to
get the blaze under control.
The lire created a great deal of excite
ment along Market street. It was fought
wholly from the south side of the street
and the Market-street cars were not
stopped, but hundreds who were on their
way home jumped off the cars, attracted
!by the blaze. The upper floors of the
buildings affected by the fire were occu
pied as lodging-houses, and the lodgers
made hasty exit, dragging out trunks and
satchels filled with their belongings or
rushing pellmell through the streets with
their arms full of clothing. The building
in which the fire originated immediately
adjoins the notorious Midway Plaisanco.
The show was in progress at the time, but
the noise of a fire engine puffing In front
of the house soon drove the audience from
the building.
The buildings damaged by fire and
water were as follows: 783 Market street
first floor occupied by Oardall &â â  Hessell
as a restaurant; second floor. National
Business Agency and B. Lee's tailoring
establishment; third floor, lodging-house.
Three-story building. 3, 5 and 7 Fourth
streetâ first floor, King Brothers' book
store and O'Brien & Galvln's saloon; up
per floors, Mme. Ravenna, clairvoyant.
Three-story frame building, 9 and 11
Fourth streetâ J. W. Williams' restaurant,
oyster-house and saloon. The buildings
belong to John W. Mackay and the loss
will reach at least $5000.
The Court Erred.
The Judge of the Superior Court of Mon
terey County received a decided setback
yesterday at the hands of the Justices of
the Supreme Court. Charles L. Westlake
in 1597 was the Tax Collector of Monterey
County, and the was indicted by the
Grand Jury for embezzling $371, and after
a trial was sentenced to ten years in the
State prison. An appeal was taken from
the judgment on the ground that the
court had erred in its instructions to the
Jury. Supreme Court Commissioner
Cooper, who wrote the opinion, also con
sidered that a serious error had been com
mitted to the injury of the defendant, for
he holds that "the Judge of the lower
court instructed the jury that the willful
omission to pay over the money itself
made the defendant guilty as charged."
The Justices agreed with this view of the
matter and the judgment and order deny
ing a new trial was reversed.
Inspector Cook Promoted.
Port Surveyor Spear has be*Â»n granted
an additional clerk at a salary of $1500
per annum. Customs Inspector Charles
T. Cook has been appointed to the posi
tion.
TO REVISE
THE SYSTEM
OF TAXATION
Revenue Laws to Be
Overhauled.
AN IMPORTANT INNOVATION
FIRST SESSION OF THE SENATE
COMMITTEE.
Outline of the Work Discussed and
Plans of Procedure Decided
Upon by the Com
mittee.
Just before the last State Senate ad
journed a committee was appointed to
Investigate the tax system of the State
and to report to the next Legislature any
suggestions for its improvement. The
committee was composed of Senators S.
<". Smith of Bakersfield, J. C. Sims of
Santa Rosa and E. R. Taylor of Alameda.
The first session of the committee was
held at the Lick House yesterday, the
members bringing business interests in
the city together so they could meet
There was little in the way of business
transacted, but plans for future work
were discussed and a general system of
work was agreed upon.
The committee will first send circular
letters to the various county Boards of
Supervisors, asking for information re
garding the cost of tax collection, also
statistics as to sources of revenue and
the proportions from each. Letters will
also be sent to the different States, in
quiring about different systems of taxa
tion. It was further decided to invite
communications from any one interested
in the subject, and any suggestions so
made will receive the careful attention of
the committee. These communications
may be sent to any member of the com
mitteeâSenator Smith at Bakersfield. Sen-
Sims at Santa Rosa or Senator Taylor at
Alameda.
The aim of the committee was stated
very broadly in the resolution providing
for its appointment. The resolution was
presented by Senator Smith, and his in
tention was to investigate and report; but
before the next sf-ssion the committee will
probably hnve gone further than that and
will have pr^par^d the form of a bill to
revise the tax system, or at least a re
vision and codification of the present tax
laws.
SAN JOSE NORMAL.
Important Meeting of the Directors
Monday.
The new board of directors of the San
Jose Normal School met in this city on
Monday and organized. Dr. Brown of
San Jose was elected chairman for one
year. A temporary executive committee
was appointed, consisting of Directors
Brown. Swiggert and Leavitt. Judge
Short of Fresno and State Superintendent
Kirk were elected members of the joint
board.
The election of the president of the San
Jose school was deferred to June 2. at
which time the hoard will meet in San
Jose. The candidates fur president are
the incumbent (Professor Randall t and
Professor C. \V. Cbilds. Professor Mc-
Naughton of Arizona has also filed an
application for the position. There has
been considerable friction at the school
for the past two years, and the meeting
of the board is being regarded with keen
Interest.
Professor Childs was president of the
school when Governor Budd took office
and was ousted by the Democratic board
of directors. It is regarded as possible
that he will be elected. Should Professor
Childs be again made president it may
lead to many changes in the teachers.
Under the rules the president nominates
all the teachers and the directors elect
them. On June 2 the board will also ap
portion the patronage of the clerks, jani
tors and general keepers.
Stole a Bill of Lading.
Moritz Politzer, nephew of Alexander
Politzer, liquor merchant. 503 California
street, swore to a complaint in Acting
Police Judge Groezinger's court yesterday
for the arrest of George Wollenschlager,
who kept a saloon at Butchertown, on the
charge of grand larceny. Wollenschlager
ordered from Politzer two barrels of
whisky that were shipped from the East.
When they arrived Politzer took the bill
k>f lading to Wollenschlager to collect the
amount due. $90, and he alleges that Wol
lenschlager grabbed him by the throat
and forcibly took the bill or lading from
him.
Have Leave to Mortgage.
\ Judge Daingerfield yesterday granted
leave to the board of trustees of the
Emanuel Baptist Church, the scene of the
Durrant murders, to mortgage the realty
! fr>r the Bum of $9000. A larger mortgage
heretofore existed, but it was reduced to
the present figure, the leave to mortgage
for $9000 being obtained to pay off a sub
sequent claim and to improve the church
proper.

THE CHARTER CLUB.
THE meeting at Metropolitan Temple on Mon
day night to organize a civic body for the pur
pose of influencing municipal administration in
the interest of property and industries was a very sig
nificant gathering. The 5! ! >y the chairman de
scribed the decline in values in San Francisco during
last decade, putting it at nearly half a billion dol
lars. The statement is sufficiently startling to stir to
activity the peoplt re injured by that mighty
shrinkage. The chairman presented the case by a
sentence that strikes the reader with all the interest
of novelty when he said the purpose of the meeting
was: "If possible, to determine some means by which
to prevent further loss to the owners of our city."
"The owners of the city." It would appear on the
surface that the city is owned by the politicians and
office-holders. They are in authority. They take the
taxes and spend them, and the property-owners run
hither and yon pleading for mercy in their assess
ments, looking in despair upon a rising taxable rate
dii a constantly falling actual value, until there is a
feeling abroad that they are the tenants of the prop
on and the office-holders are the landlords.
So it strikes one as novel when the property
owners are referred to truthfully as "the owners of
the city." It is their property. That property has
fallen in value for ten years at the rate of fifty mil
lions a year, and its owners have at last concluded to
take matters into their own hands and find out why
their property, the city, has lost value at such a
rapid rate.
The gods stand off while the man crie6 for help to
pull his wagon out of the mire; but when he puts
hiÂ« own shoulder to the wheel and says nothing, but
lifts with all his might, then all Olympus runs to his
tance.
The owners of this city have been invoking all the
powers of earth and air and .vater to come to their
assistance and lift the value of their property out of its
decline. But now they have taken hold themselves,
and it their expressed purpose is carried out politics
will no longer hold a club over them, but they will
hold a club over politics and harness it to their policy
for the municipal, commercial and industrial regenera
tion of San Francisco.
This city wants more business and the greater popu
lation that it will bring. Half million clubs are use
less things if they propose to merely bring immigra
tion without bringing also the business that must sup
port it. It is not only through municipal administra
tion that lost values are to be recovered, but through
individual and organized enterprise in business.
San Francisco has not had enough of this enter
prise. Business plants that shou.d have come here
have gone elsewhere. For the sake of that prime
economy in transportation, the bringing of ship and
car together, commerce has gone up the bay to Port
Costa, and much of it farther away to Puget Sound
ports, because ship and car are kept apart in this
city, which has the best facilities in the world for
bringing them together. European cities have spent
millions of dollars to secure that facility which is put
here by nature and without cost.
The Central Republican Charter Club will find
nniple scope for its work in the interest of the own
ers of this city, and it must first convince them that
they nre the owners, and that their interests are mu
tual nnd common. How would the affairs of a stock
company flourish if its owner-, the stockholders,
should consider themselves Republicans or Demo
crats in a sense superior to their character as owners
of the property? How would things go if on election
day a competent ticket for directors was opposed by
a ticket of incompetents who would be elected be
cause their political partisans were in a majority in
â¢' â  company? The owners of this city are the own
'â  of it- property. Their interests are common and
tv separable. What hurts one hurts all. Let them re
metnber this and determine to stand together as the
owners of a common interest, and municipal adminis
tration will become a business affair in which the in
terests of the owners of the city will be considered
and all the people will be helped by it.
Thomas Reed of Maine may not be the most lov
able man in the world, but there is no disputing his
caliber. Any budding statesman with designs on the
retiring Speaker's chair would do well to furnish him
self with guy ropes to keep from slithering around on
its highly polished surface.
The Prince of Wales, the dispatches announce,
affects a pronounced liking to hear American "coon"
songs whistled. Is it possible that his Royal High
ness contemplates the introduction of the cake walk
into the aristocratic and exclusive circles in which
he moves?
THE MARKET STREET RAILROAD
INIQUITY.
WHEN the cars of the Market street combina
tion straddle the crossings of the streets or
pass them at a high rate of speed, ignoring the
motions of waiting customers, there are a few gen
j tlcmen in San Francisco who always take of! their
hats to indicate their appreciation of Mr. Hunting
ton's absolute rule and of the fact that pedestrians
have no rights that the Market Street Railway Com
' i any is bound to respect.
It had been supposed that, owing to legal obstacles,
1 the attempted grab by this arrogant monopoly of
whole sections of the city so as to reduce almost the
I entire territory north and much of it south of Mar
' ket street to its absolute control had been tem
porarily abandoned. But, at the meeting of the
Board of Supervisors on Monday last, the community
was undeceived, for all the former demands were re
\ived and extended, with the recorded sanction of
seven members of the board. Nothing but a technical
blunder, so far as can be seen,, prevented the entire
! grab as amended from reaching the first legal stage on
j the road to success.
In the editorial columns of The Call on the 7th and
1 Bth of May the comprehensiveness and the rascality of
j this audacious invasion of public right were clearly
1 exposed. It was not then certain, however, that a
majority of the Street Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors were ready, in private session, to accept any
proposal the Market Street Railway Company had to
offer, in order to thwart the operation of the new
charter, or that a majority of the board itself were
eager to act as ratifying agents of the monopoly.
This flaunting contempt of the pablic will and of the
public interests was reserved for the proceedings of
Monday.
The details of this unprecedented scheme of plun
der have now been perfected. It includes the re
mainder of Sansome street north of Pacific street, a
block on Battery street between Sacramento and Cali
, fotnia streets, a block on Stockton street between
I Pacific street and Broadway, and two approaches to
the city and county line, one terminating on Milliken
-treet and the other on Forty-ninth avenue, near the
Cliff House. All these franchises are exacted for fifty
; years, or double the time allowed by the new charter.
The present Geary street franchise, which would ex
pire November 6. 1903, it is proposed to surrender on
j condition that a new and coextensive franchise, cov
ering electricity and all other motive powers, be
granted. The new franchises on Taylor street be
tween Geary and Post streets and along Grant avenue
I from its intersection with Geary street to Bush street
â  and down Bush street to Sansome street are of course
demanded. The use of electricity and of other im
provements in motive power is also required for the
whole system. The new charter not only limits the
duration of street railroad franchises to one-half the
period now permitted, but explicitly declares that no
such franchise shall be granted unless the percentage
ci gross receipts offered is at least 3 per cent for the
first five years, 4 per cent for the next ten and 5 per
I cent for the last ten years. The drafted resolutions now
1 presented by the Market Street Railway Company
relieve the corporation from the payment of any per
centage for five years. The statute of March 13. 1897,
: only requires 3 per cent to be contributed for the last
forty-five years of the franchise. The new charter,
furthermore, enables the municipality "to fix. establish
1 and reduce the fares and charges for transporting pas
sengers and goods." and contains other stringent
â  provisions for the protection of the public which are
i not embodied in the existing laws.
This is the most atrocious and unspeakably dishon
est plan to destroy possible competition and to
firmly intrench a railroad despotism in our midst of
which there is any record. The bulkhead bills of 1859
and 1800, which sought to place the entire water front
in the hands of French capitalists, were supposed at -
the time to have no precedent for infamy and for :
audacity. But in 1899 the Market Street Railway
Company has easily surpassed that wholesale scheme
of confiscation which the Supervisors of forty years
ago repudiated, and of the triumph of which there
was never any danger while an honest Governor pos
sessed the veto power. Now, in the full glare of pub
licity, with the facts and with the law thoroughly ven
tilated and understood, it appears that all Mr. Hun
tington has to do is to signify his pleasure to seven
members of the board and his intricate robbery is ap
| proved, before even its details could have been read.
As the new charter goes into effect on January 1,
1900. and as the existing franchise of the Geary Street
Railway Company has more than four years to run. it
i e impossible for any part of the vile project which
has been thus impudently uncovered, and especially
! lor so much of it as relates to Geary street, to suc
ceed without manifest corruption. Cranks and
fanatics are often unjust to public officers, but this is
a proposition that the most tolerant citizen in San
Francisco cannot fail to indorse. To give franchises
for half a century, and to deprive the city of not less
than 3 per cent on gross receipts for five years, and
of an increasing proportion for forty-five years
I longer, when, by waiting for seven months, the new
I law that the people and the Legislature have ratified
i can be enforced, is transparently iniquitous and in-
I capable of explanation. And these are only isolated
i specifications of the enormous injury that this com
munity is expected to endure. The monopoly could
afford to pay a million dollars to consummate the
steal.
If the opinion of the City and County Attorney
upon the questions arising from this latest railroad
fraud has been delivered there has been no publication
of the fact. But appearances indicate that neither
law, evidence nor our metropolitan necessities, which
are increasing year by year, are to receive the slight
i est consideration at the hands of Mr. Huntington or
j of a bare majority of the Board of Supervisors.
The patience of the property-holding citizens of
San Francisco has been frequently and severely taxed,
! but this last raid upon the municipality transcends all
former experience.
THE CONTEST FOR THE SPEAK
ERSHIP
WHILE Tom Reed has not yet given the pub
lic a formal notice of his intention to retire
from political life, and has not resigned his
seat in Congress, it is abundantly evident that he has
given his friends notice that he will not be a candi
date for the of this Congress. That
much is demonstrated by the activity of the canvass
now going on for the office.
The number of candidates is about as large as that
of States having strong Republican delegations in
Congress, for while there are some such States hav
ing no candidate, there are several which have two or
more, and the average holds good. It is gratifying to
note that thus far hardly any candidate has been put
forward upon sectional grounds, though of course
such considerations are sure to come later. For the
present the one desire of the party appears to be that
of choosing the best man for the place.
Numerous as are the aspirants, only a few of
them have any strong following at this time. Among
these are three New York men, Sherman, Payne and
THE SAN FRANCISCO , CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 24. 1899.
Ray. The first two are men of long experience and
represent the veterans of the party, while Ray is a
young warhorse and hopes to win by dash and vigor
rather than upon his record.
Illinois has a veteran candidate in the well-known
"Joe" Cannon, who as chairman of the Committee on
Appropriations has rendered good service to his party
1 and proven himself an able debater. The same State
has also a young man candidate in Mr. Hopkins, who,
however, has some claims as a veteran also, since he
has served in eight Congresses. He isinow making
a more active canvass than any other candidate and
has already gone to Washington to catch any stray
Representative who may be there.
Ohio has a candidate in Mr. Grosvenor, who dur
ing the last Congress was looked upon as the spokes
man of the administration and whose skill as a de
bater and as a parliamentarian is well known. lowa
presents for the office General David Bremer Hender
son, a veteran of Congress and of the Civil War â a
man not only of strong but of picturesque character
and much given to the use of language that requires
explanation. For example, he is now being charged
with having said that American hams for export
ought to be wrapped in the stars and stripes, and
his enemies hold he has more reverence for the lowa
ham than the banner of his country, despite his ser
vice under h in war.
It is probable the contest may be prolonged to such
a point that a dark horse will have a chance to win.
Should that prove so. the Pacific Coast should cer
tainly have a candidate to put forward, not on sec
tional grounds, but upon the broad principle that it
is time for the nation to recognize the services of
Pacific Coast men. Mr. Loud has risen steadily in j
the estimation of the House and of the country dur- j
ing his service in Congress and would be a good man
to support should there be any chance for a man
from the coast.
THE STRAW BOND INVESTIGATION.
I-UJROM every point of view the steps taken by the
Grand Jury to investigate the straw bond
frauds alleged to have been practiced by Police
Court Clerk Kelly are gratifying, and it is to be
hoped the inquiry will be eventually extended to
cover the whole range of such offenses.
The straw bond evil is one which has long been
complained of in every important city in the United
States. It is an outgrowth of the shyster element
which has been permitted to attach itself to the bar,
and which by its own corruption has corrupted the
practices of the courts themselves and led to the de
velopment of a hundred forms of trickery, cunning
and fraud to defeat the law.
Every now and then there occurs some flagrant in
stance of such corruption to arouse public indigna
tion, and then there is an investigation, which for a
time renders the tricksters more cautious in their
work. Rarely, however, does it happen in any city
that wholesale convictions of offenders take place
and adequate punishment is meted out. Therefore
any earnest effort to accomplish -nich results is always
a matter for public congratulation.
From the reports given out of the results of the in
vestigation thus far, there appears good prospect that
ample evidence will be obtained in the investigations
now undertaken by the Grand Jury to obtain at least
one conviction. Kelly seems to have carried on the
practice of issuing straw bonds with such boldness
that his offenses can be easily proven even under the
restrictions placed upon legal testimony.
It is stated that there have been submitted to the
Grand Jury over one hundred bonds accepted by
Kelly which bond experts have declared to be worth
less. Some of the saloon-keepers who signed bonds
which Kelly accepted are reported to have admitted
they signed them for political reasons, while others
assigned business reasons for their action. One of
the latter is quoted as having said: "In every case
where I went as surety on a bond I did so as a matter
of business. When a frequenter of my saloon had the
misfortune to be arrested I gladly consented to be
come one of his bondsmen rather than have him stay
in jail over night."
It appears, moreover, that in the course of the in
vestigation the Grand Jury has discovered evidence
that in many crises criminals have been released be
fore the bonds required by law were riled. Thus it is
said that a woman, a notorious pickpocket, >vas once
released on an order from Kelly five minutes after she
was arrested, while the required bonds were not fur
nished and placed on record in court until the fol
lowing day.
The people of San Francisco have seen so many
prosecutions based upon seemingly irresistible evi
dence come to nothing that they will not be sanguine
of conviction in this casr, notwithstanding the
strength of the testimony reported to have been given.
Still they will be well pleased if the Grand Jury con
tinue its efforts. Exposure is not as good as convic
tion, but it helps to hold rascality in check, and that
is something.
The people of the United States persist in insisting

SAN FRANCISCO
SHOULD HAVE
A BIG EXHIBIT
Representation at the
State Fair.
APPEAL TO SUPERVISORS
THE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE
TAKES ACTION.
President A. B. Spreckels Gives Rea
f one Why the Metropolis Should
Make a Good Showing
This Year-
An urgent appeal has been made to the
Board of Supervisors by the State Board
of Agriculture, to secure proper represen
tation of the city's industries at the State
Fair to be held in Sacramento next fall.
The reason why such representation from
the State's metropolis should be made are
set forth at length and will no doubt re
ceive proper consideration at the hands
of the board. The appeal comes to the
board in the form of a communication
from A. B. Spreckels, president of the
State Board of Agriculture, and is aa
follows:
May 19, 1899.
To the Board of Supervisorsâ Gentlemen: At
a recent meeting ot the State Agricultural
Society It was determined to communicate
with the Boards of Supervisors of the various
counties and tv request them to have prepared
an exhibit of the agricultural products and
resources of their respective counties.
The directors desire to give the State Fair
a State character and to make it as broadly
useful to every section of the State as pos
sible; to make It a medium for the supplying
of agricultural and industrial Information, the
promotion of Internal developments and the
encouragement of desirable Immigration.
The usual attendance at a State Fair Is very
large, and a great number of persons from
abroad who are contemplating locating or in
vesting In this State, or who might be in
duced to locate or invest here, come to the
State FRir to view the products of our State
and to determine her agricultural and indus
trial possibilities. To the end that our great
variety ot products should be given proper
display and that accurate and reliable evi
dence may be given of the special products
of each section of the Staff, the directors de
sire that an exhibit of the products of each
county be prepared by the Board of Super
visors of eacfi county for exhibition at the
appioacning State Ifair.
A separate of the Exhibition Pa
vilion will be set apart for these county ex
hibits, which will t.e set up by the society
without expense, and a proper and qualified
attendant will be put in charge who will pre
sent and explain in detail to travelers and
the general public. If the county, or any
Board of Trade, Immigration Society or Cham
ber of Commerce organized within It desire
to supply any literature or printed matter for
distribution In connection with this display,
it will be so distributed by the person in
charge. If the county or any county organ
ization should desire to employ a special at
tendant for its exhibit no objection will be
made.
As to the character and extent of the county
exhibits, the boar.l desires that this should
be left entirely to the discretion of the county
authorities making the exhibit. The exhibit
should contain samples or displays of the
leading and most valuable products of the re
spective counties. This could be done with
such simplicity or elaboration as the re
sources of' the board necessitate. It can be
made very .small and inexpensive or It may
be made much more extensive and costly. In
your county, for example, your people are
largely Interested in fruit, green, dried and
preserved; raisins, wines, wheat, barley, corn,
hay, alfalfa, hops, dairy produce, etc. Sam
ples of these products, of such size and ex
tent, mounted or prepared in such manner as
your taste and Judgment dictate, would form
a sufficient representation of your agricultural
wealth.
These exhibits, when properly prepared, will
be or primary and principal importance to
the county making them, but when all pre
pared will constitute an industrial and agri
cultural man of California and will be of
such general benefit that It is to be hoped
that every county will, with proper public
spirit, contribute its share.
ThÂ« State Board of Agriculture very much
defiirer that you should give this" matter such
attention as It requires, and fhat you will
do so at a sufficiently early day to provide
for the collection of all the different articlf-s
in proper season. The cost of the collection
by you will be very small Indeed. You can
make it as small as the resources at your
command necessitate. The society will at
tend to Its mounting and display and will
provide for Its explanation and presentation
to the greatest possible number of spectators.
Hoping that your board will take this mat
ter up at your earliest convenience and notify
the society of your favorable action. I am.
Yours respectfully. A. B. SPRECKELS.
President.

Secretary.

An Interesting Itinerary That In
cludes a Glimpse of Every Branch
of Agriculture Represented
in California.
The work of preparing a reception to
the Association of American Agricultural
Colleges, which will meet here early in
July, was well started yesterday in the
rooms of the Chamber of Commer*.
Notices had been sent to all thejmem
bere to attend a meeting to discuss plans
of procedure, and before it closed a well
defined idea had been formulated for the
two committees that were appointed.
Mayor Phelan presided and Professor
Jaffa, assistant professor at the Univer
sity of California, explained the purpose
of the meeting. He showed what an ad
vertisement for California the convention
would be if the members of it were only
given an opportunity to study conditions
of agriculture in this State. He said there
had been planned a trip of perhaps a
thousand miles, which would lake in
Sonoma, Napa, Sacramento, Santa Clara
and San JoaQuin valleys. The railroad
had offered a rate of $1 a mile for the
special, and had offered to stop the train
anywhere where it would not interfere
with general traffic. Mr. Foster of the
San Francisco and North Pacific Rail
road had also made an offer of transpor
tation. He would give a special for the
Sonoma Valley.
Professor Jaffa estimated that there
would at least 150 in the party, and the
trips planned would take eight or nine
days. Mr. Mills supplemented Professor
Jaffa's remarks with a few suggestions
as to the itinerary. His idea was to take
the visitors to the great centers of in
dustry, such as Chico for harvesting,
Napa' for deciduous fruits, Salinas for
beet sugar, Orovllle for citrus fruits, Ba
i kersfield for irrigation and Marin for
dairying. It was understood Los Angeles
and the south would look after the trav
elers south of Tehachapi.
A. C. Darby, president of the Board of
! Trade of San Jose, was on hand to offer
the co-operation of San Jose in any plan
for entertainment.
It was decided to appoint a committee
on arrangements and one on finance. They
! were made up as follows:
Arrangementsâ Professor Jaffa, J. A.
Filcher, Colonel E. A. Denicke, E. F.
Adams. H. H. Taylor, A. C. Darby. Cap
tain Nelson, a professor from Stanford
i University to be selected and the Mayor
1 ex offlcio.
Financeâ Prentiss Smith, T. J. Parsons,
1 Julian Sonntag. E. B. Pond, Archie
I Schmidt, A. S. Baldwin, Leroy Nicol, A.
I Sbarboro, Charles Bundschu and the
j Mayor ex officio.
Professor Jaffa was named secretary of
j the main organization. He will establish
' headquaners at room 4, second floor. Mills
j building.
It has been decided that there will be
! but little sightseeing. The visitors will
j come to learn, and it is considered that
! in giving them an opportunity to do so
I they will be best entertained. It will take
. at leaÃt $3000 to properly care for them.
I The Mayor has already subscribed $200
j and H. H. Taylor $100. The finance com
mittee will attend to the collection of the
i remainder.

ACCUSED OF ROBBERY.
Allan Kane and Charles F. Wilson, |
Two Soldiers, Detained in the
City Prison.
Allan Kane and Charles F. Wilson, two
soldiers, appeared before Judge Mogan !
yesterday to answer a charge of disturb- |
ing the peace. They were arrested Mon
day night by Policemen Flynn and Me- |
Grayan. and at the request of the officers
they were ordered into custody and their i
bonds raised to $500 each.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Nyhan, 2043^ !
Harrison street, called at the City Prison 'â 
and said her sun. Timothy, had been j
robbed by two soldiers the previous night i
of a purse containing $7(/. They had at
tempted to cut his throat before robbing
him and cut his lip. She was sent to
Judge Megan's court and repeated her >
story, and the Judge accordingly in- !
creased the bonds of the two soldiers, as
they were suspected of committing the
robbery.
Detectives Graham and Fitzgerald of
the Mission were detailed on the case and
called at Mrs. Nyhan's house to gel Tim
othy to go with them to the prison to Me
if he could identify the soldiers, but Tim
othy complained that he was sick, and |
begged to be excused until this morning, j
The soldiers laugh at the robbery story,
and the detectives do not place much cre
dence in it. as Timothy has been in trou
ble with the police himself, and they as
certained that he had taken the money I
from his mother.

GAS COMPANY
WILL APPEAL
TO THE COURTS
Afraid Its Bills Will
Not Be Paid.
LIGHTS MAY BE SHUT OFF
DESPERATE MEASURES NOW ON
THE PROGRAMME.
The Corporation Would Restrain the
Board of Supervisors From Us
ing Money in the Street
Light Fund.
The action taken by the Board of Su
pervisors Monday in again deferring final
authorization for the payment of the bills
of the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company bids fair to force the hand of
the corporation because of the fact that
there is a strong probability that there
will be an attempt to dispose of the
money in the fund used for the payment
of the city's light bills before the present
â contest between the minority and the ma
jority in the board is adjusted. Should
this be done the company will be left with
unpaid light bills amounting in round fig
ures to $185,000 on its hands at the end of
the fiscal year. As the debts contracted
in one fiscal year cannot be paid out of
the funds of another year the corporation
would be left without recourse and the
sum named would represent a net loss.
Finding themselves face to face with
this serious proposition the officials inti
mated yesterday that they would have
recourse to one or both of two alterna
tives. One is that they will apply to the
courts for an injunction to restrain the
Board of Supervisors from transferring
money from the street light fund to any
other fund or for any other purpose than
that of paying the city's light bills. The
other is that they will shut off all of the
city's gas and electric lights and leave
the community in darkness.
This latter course would have the effect
of bringing about an action that would
result in an order of court directing the
gas company to continue to serve the city
with gas and electric light pending a legal
settlement of the controversy. Pending
such determination through legal chan
nels the bills of the company would prob
ably be paid by order of court, such or
ders being payable out of any funds in
the city treasury. In this manner the
corporation would at least insure to itself
the payment of its light bills for the bal
ance of the fiscal year. It is not believed,
however, that this course will be adopted
for the reason that it would tend to preju
dice public opinion against the gas com
pany.
It is certain that the gas company will
take such legal steps as may be deemed
recessary to prevent the Board of Super
visors from disposing of the money in
the street light fund. If this is done the
authorizations for the payment of the
company's bills for November. December,
January. February and March will be
passed and they will then be vetoed by
the Mayor. This will give the corpora
tion the opportunity to apply to the courts
for the fixing of The legal rate to be paid
for gas. ________^____

A. C. Rulofson, who alleges himself to
be the adopted son of the late "VVlnslow

Judge Belcher's court and gave testimony
in his own behalf in his suit to recover
the entire estate of the* deceased capi

Rulofson recited in detail the unhappy
life he led with his father and the rea
sons that prompted him to leave home

witness testified that after being prom

clothes 'out of the window of the room
In which he was confined and jumped out
after them. He went to the home of a
friend and then went to yea. Subsequent

FIREMEN RESCUE TWO
MEN FROM GAS FUMES
FATHER AND SON NEARLY
ASPHYXIATED.
Mrs. Smith Awakens to Find the
House Filled With the Fluid
and Her Family Un
conscious.
Firemen who proved to be equal to
other emergencies than those of fire res-
I cued C. H. Smith and A. L. Smith, who
â  were nearly overcome by escaping gas
at 1453 Valencia street, early yesterday
morning. Both men were fast becoming
victims of the deadly fumes when the fire
fighters, attracted by the cries of a
"frightened wife and mother, rushed from
the house of engine 13, directly opposite,
and dragging the victims to , the street
restored them to consciousness.
A. L. Smith, who is well advanced in
: years, occupied a room connected with
the back apartments of the house. His
son, C. H. Smith, slept in an adjoining
1 room. About 5 o'clock yesterday morning
Mrs. Smith awoke, nearly stifled by gas. ;
; She attempted to awaken her husband, i
but he could not. move. Entering her '
son's apartments she discovered that a
jet in the center of the room was leaking
and tried to awaken him. He partially !
regained his senses, but soon relapsed
Into a comatose state. Then she rushed
to the front porch, where she cried for
help. .â -â ?. -â â 'â -â '
James Rlley, James O Connor, J. Mc-
Quade and John Pendergast, all firemen,
1 heard her cries and went to her assist
ance. When they entered the room they
could hardly endure the gas-laden atmos
phere. They. threw open the windows and
pulled the men outside. Both were un- |
conscious, and it required some effort to
resuscitate them. After dispatching Of
-1 fleer Potter for Dr. Coffey at 11-12 Valen
cia street the firemen worked hard and j
soon had the men out of danger. When |
the physician arrived hp administered i
restoratives and his patients were able to |
be about last evening. .
Caroline Kusel Defeated.
The action of Caroline Kusel against
lier husband. 8. A. Kusel. was decided by
Judge Murasky yesterday, the court hold-
Ing that thÂ«> plaintiff was not entitled to
the relief prayed for. Mrs. Kusel h*t her
husband according to agreement, and
Judge Murasky decided that such course
was not in keeping with public policy.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 24, 1899.
He decided that in event Mrs. Kusel was
not driven from her home through the
cruel treatment of her husband or other
wise she should return, otherwise she
could not recover a judgment for main
tenance.
HAS FOUND A FRIEND.
Colonel Henry Moore, the Old Miner
Arrested for Vagrancy, Gets
His Freedom.
Colonel Henry Moore, miner and ex
attache of the Shah of Persia, has found
a friend, and yesterday Judge Mogan. af
ter admonishing him not to beg on Mont
gomery street any more, allowed him to
go, with the promise that if he again
found himself in absolute want he would
give him an order to admit him to the
Almshouse.
Yesterday morning the Judge received
a letter from Frank Van Tassel. 368 Elev
enth street, who said he had been a miner
in Western Australia, and added: "Please
send Colonel Moore to me and I will as
sist him, as I know he is telling the
truth." The old miner got Van Tassel' 3
address and said he would call upon him.
He seemed delighted to find that his story
of his experiences in Coolgardle. Western
Australia, had been corroborated.

Point for Mary M. Morrisey,
Judge Murasky yesterday overruled the
demurrer of the Board of Education to
the complaint of Mary M. Morrisey, who
seekÃ to be reinstated to her position as
teacher in thÂ© John Swett Grammar
School. In its demurrer the board al
leged that it had arbitrarily closed the
school in question, but the court held that
the board could not arbitrarily put an end
to the existence of a school; it must have
cause. The demurrer was therefore over
ruled and the board given ten days to
answer.
THE EMBANKMENT
THROUGH THE MARSH
STATEMENT OF GENERAL MAN
AGER KRUTTSCHNITT.
The Condition of the Track on the
Alaxneda Marsh in No Respect
Dangerous.
CARD TO THE PUBLIC.
The settling of the embankment of
the South Pacific Coast road in the
marsh on the south shore of San Lean
dro Bay, to which considerable atten
tion has been given of late by the press,
does not introduce any element of dan
ger in the operation of trains, and, but
for some slight delay that was experi
enced on two or three occasions, would
no doubt have passed without notice.
In throwing up the embankment the
i builders of the road excavated ditches
i In the marsh, leaving little or no space
between them and the toe of the slope
ito support the bank. The action of the
1 tides in running through these side
ditches has prevented them from filling
i up, as would otherwise have been the
case, and the settling that has recently
taken place was no doubt immediately
caused by the recent ballasting of the
| piece of track in question, increasing
somewhat the height and weight of the
embankment.
On the first signs of trouble watch
men were placed on duty and never at
any time was there the slightest danger
of trains running into the sink. When
i ever settling took place temporary re
! pairs were made and the work now in
I progress is sufficiently well advanced to
warrant the expectation that the
trouble at that point will be perma
nently remedied. The remedy Is a very
; simple one. The Bide or borrow ditches
will be damned to prevent the forward
and backward rush of tide waters, after
which they will be tilled up with stone
and other heavy material to balance
the weight of the embankment and pre
vent subsidence. This remedy, which
has proven entirely successful in num
bers of similar cases of settling on
other parts of the company's lines, will
be applied wherever there are signs of
possible settlement, and this statement
is made for the purpose of assuring the
I public, our patrons, who are using the
i line in question, that they run no risk
of accident. No train is permitted to
cross the repaired track without sig
nals from the watchman, and, should
a subsidence, through remote possibil
ity, take place under a passing train,
the speed is so slow that accident would
be impossible.
The trouble in question is by no
j means unusual. It has been experi-
I enced in the marshes between Benicia
and Suisun ami between Port Costa and
Antioch, in this State; in the marshes
I bordering on the Atchafalaya River,
! nnd in the trembling prairies or
i marshes bordering on Bayou dcs Alle
i mands in Louisiana. In most of these
cases, whore the sinks were far more
serious and extensive than the one in
the Alameda marsh, the same method
of treatment was applied. In no case
did any accident happen, although the
I train movements were very much
heavier than on the South Pacific Coast
Railway. J. KRUTTBCHNITT.

Manager, Southern Pacific Company.

JOINING OF THE
ISSUES IN THE
GAS RATE CASE
William B. Hooper
Files His Answer.
REFUSES TO PAY THE DEMAND
ALLEGES THAT THE NEW BATH
IS THE LEGAL ONE.
Other Points Are Brought Out in the
Pleadings That Will Result in a
Thorough Trial of the
Suit.
Issues have beÂ«n Joined In the action of
the San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany against William B. Hooper, pro
prietor of the Occidental Hotel, to re
cover $631 40 alleged to be due for gas
consumed during the month of April at
the rate of $1 75 a thousand feet. An an
swer was filed yesterday by Mr. Hooper
in which he denies owing the company
the amount claimed, t*ie defendant set
ting forth the Jl 10 a thousand rate, re- I
cently adopted by the Supervisors for the I
ensuing fiscal year, as the proper charge,
and, after bringing in various collateral
matters, which will result in an adjudi
cation of the case to the satisfaction of
all concerned, prays to be dismissed with
his costs.
The answer reads:
For a first and separate defense, defendant
denies that tha_ gas mentioned In the com
plaint was furnished, supplied, sold or delivered
by the plaintiff at the rate of Â»1 75 per one
thousand cubic feet, or at any greatÂ«r rate or
more than $1 10 per one thousand cubic feet, i
and denies that defendant promised to pay for
said gas the turn of $631 40, or any sum or !
I amount greater than $1 10 per one thousand
| cubic feet, to wit, the aggregate sum of Â»39S 88,
and denies that any account was ever stated
I between plaintiff and defendant at all.
For a second and separate defense defendant
alleges:
I. That the gae mentioned In the complaint
was illuminating gas of the standard quality
and Illuminating power of not more than seven
| teen candles, and was furnished by plaintiff
! to defendant In the city and county of San
Francisco after the third day of April. 1899.
11. That during all the times mentioned
In the complaint and at all times on and since
March 4, I^TS, there was not and there still
are not any public works owned or controlled
I hy the municipality, the city and county of
i San Francisco, for supplying the said municl
] pality with artificial light, and during all the
said times last mentioned the plaintiff and Its
I predecessors In Interest was and were and has
been and have been and plaintiff still le a
company and corporation Incorporated under
the laws of the State of California for supply
ing snld municipality, and the inhabitants
thereof, with artificial light and for the pur
pose of supplying gas for the us* of said city
and county of San Francisco and its inhab
itants; and during ail of said last mentioned
times, under the direction of the Superintend
ent of Streets of said city and county of San I
Francisco, and under general regulations rre- j
scribed by the said municipality and by the i
Roard of Supervisors and legislative authority |
thereof, the plaintiff or Its predecessors in In
terest had had and used and during all the ;
same times has and have had and used and
plaintiff still has and uses the prlvllere of
' using the public streets and thoroughfares of
{ said municipality, and of laying down pipes
, and conduits theretn. and connections tner*-
I with, so far as was and might be or may be
; nr le necessary' fÂ°r Introducing Into and supply-
Ing said city and county and Its Inhabitants
' with gas light and other Illuminating light: t
and during all the said times the pipes and i
mains ut said plaintiff have been and still are j
laid down in the streets and highways of smld j
city and county of San Francisco for thÂ« pur
pose of supplying gas for the use of said city
and the inhabitants thereof.
111. That during all the times last mentioned
the said city and oounty of San Francisco \
has been and still Is a city having a population â¢
I of more than ltO.'XiO Inhabitants, and that on '
April 3, 1899, the Board of Supervisors of said j
city and county of San Francisco duly made i
; a resolution and determination whereby said
board determined and fixed the standard qual
; lty and Illuminating power of gas to be fur-
Dished by any company or corporation whose ;
pipes nr mains wer* then or should thereafter '
b# laid down In the streets or highways of ;
such city for the purpose of supplying gas for j
the use of such rity and for the Inhabitants 'â 
â¢ thereof at seventeen candles, and whereby It
d<>tÂ»rmlned and fixed and established the mam- |
â  mum rate and price for each 1000 cubic feet i
I of such gas to be charged therefor by any such |
I company or corporation at $1 10 per 1000 cubic ;
feet, and no morÂ«.
IV. That the said resolution of the Board of
Burervlpors was In full force and effect dur- I
Ing all times when the gas alleged In the com- I
plaint to have been furnished, supplied, sold j
and delivered to defendant was furnished,
supplied, sold and delivered to defendant.
Whereof defendant demands Judgment, that
he be hence dismissed with his costs of suit.
It is plain that all questions upon which |
the ripht of the company to still demand
the old rate of $1 75 a thousand feet is
based will he determined through the
points brought up in this answer.

for the arrest of rharles F. Deane, an
ex-clerk with the company, on the charge
of misdemeanor embezzlement. It is al
leged that on March 30 Deane collected a
bill amounting to $36 05 from Ernest
Haquette, a saloon-keeper at 16 Post
! street, and got drunk on the proceeds,
' which led to his discharge. The com
pany's collector went to Ilaquette on May
17 to collect the bill and ascertained that
Deane had collected it. Deane was called
upon at his residence, and said the money
I had been stolen from him.

DRIED AND CANNED FRUITS IN NEW
?ORK.
The New York Commercial says
-Reports from the coast regarding prunes are
mere or less unsatisfactory. Nothing definite
Is known yet, but it is certain that a majority
of the interests involved Incline to the opinion
that the crop will be more or less short. Sonoma
County an.l the Santa Clara valley both report
nome shortage, but what the percentage is it is
Impossible to say. The spot market is firm, but
prices are unchanged. Probably medium sizes
meet most Inquiry, but lots ordered are chiefly
Fmall and go to retail dealers or country dis
tributors.
"Raisins are firm and three-crown are a frac
tion higher, the demand from seeders being un
usually large. Reports from the coast have
caused no change In the market, except to In
crease the firmness. Holders are reluctant sell
ers, and business is limited to small lots for
Immediate consumption.
"Peaches are steady, with upward tendency.
The present outlook favors thÂ» assumption that
the proportion available for drying will be
small, and that prices are likely to rule high
In consequence.
"Apricots are steady, but the range is above
most buyers' Ideas, and little business results
from the inquiry. With a promised crop of per
haps 880 cars there will probably be a more
active market than has ruled this {rear.
"Canned Goodsâ The feature of the market is
â the large sale of California canned products for
future delivery, at opening prices, announced
exclusively in the Commercial last week. Some
packers are reported entirely sold out. an.i oth
ers have advanced prices on cherries, apricots
and lemon cling peaches. This action will hard
ly restrict the sale, the demand at present be
ing enormous.
"On the spot thero Is little change. All sup
plies are held firm because of the shortage of
all varieties At no time in the past ten years
has the supply of canned goixls been as small
as it is now. and holders are firm In their
views because of thai There is a cessation In
the demand for vegetables, but all supplies nr<
held firmly up to market prices, and traae,
though limited, is steady."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 23.â Neglect of the Stock !
Exchange by the outside public continued to j
he thÂ« marked feature of the trading, and, i
as Is usual In a narrow market, prices drifted
uneasily up and down, following the erratic i
movements of special stocks. Dealings were
evidently almost wholly confined to the pro
fessional element, who seek profits on the
day* turn in prices. As this class of dealers
watch pretty closely for what other people
are doing and proceed to do likewise, the net .
effect in a day's business, or taking one day â 
with another, is not large. Yesterday's late
upward movement was followed by a realiz
ing this morning and later by a sharp ad- j
vance, which was practically wiped out be- j
fore the close. Sugar was the center of In- j
terest in the market and rebounded quite j
â trongly from the early pressure, together
with the affiliated glucose stocks.
But realizing took off all the early gain and
left it at the last five points below the high- I
eft and near the low point of the day. The j
drop in Sugar was accompanied by a strong ;
rally In the New York municipal stocks. Con
solidated Gas. Manhattan, Brooklyn Transit
and Metropolitan rising from 2 to 4 points.
This concurrent movement in the leading spe
cialties gave quite an appearance of. strength
to the market for a time, and their stocks
gained in the upward movement. The weak
ness in wheat, especially the reported selling
from the Southwest, helped this movement, j
but the pervlstent reports of Insect damage |
and news from abroad that American wheat
was practicably unsalable at present prices |
helped the late break in Grangers and South
westerns. There was a growth of uneasiness j
also over the persistent hardening tendency
of foreign exchange. The actual rate for de
mand sterling touched $4 \l\ to-day, which
Is near the gold export point.
The continuing ease in money suggests that
the method employed to finance the Philip- :
pine payment to Spain has forced something j
of a redundancy in the local money market i
resulting from the rather artificial stiffness |
of exchange rates Exchange on Merlin also j
hardened a fraction to-day, although that
money center was reported to be buying I
American stocks in London.
The newly floated Industrial stocks contin
ued rather conspicuous by weakness. Ana
conda broke 2 points, and In the outside mar
ket Amalgamated Copper, the payment of
subscriptions for which was completed yester
day, fell to par, which Is the subscription
price. The closing on the Exchange was easy
In tone, though rather dull, and showed net â 
losses In nil but a few cases.
There was a good demand for some of the '
reorganization 4 per cent railroad bonds, the
Union Pacific and Northern Pacific 4s both l
touching record prices. Total sales, par value,
13.744,000.
United States Government bonds unchanged

CHICAGO, May 23.â Renewed claims of
drought from Russia and prospects of an im

The market soon began to yield, however, un
der generous selling, owing to more seasonable
weather. During the first part of the session
the market sold off a cent. Covering on advices
confirming . previously reported damage by In
sects started a rally, but liquidation set in on
every budge, and the market closed at about
the best. July opened a shade lower at 75@

of the laborers hur
into tho night
to allay their fears. No one was injured,
and soon a small army was clearing away
ihe debris; under the supervision of Mr.
Birmingham. While these men were
bending at the work, now assisted by the
light of early day. the second explosion
took place, rending the many structures
and leaving its list of dead. The shock
over and the excitement somewhat Bub
dued, a search was instituted, and near
the ruins or" the nitro-glycerin plant a fuse
was dragged forth} a break In the sur
rounding barbed-wire fence was found,

and when these incidents .â â â â â¢ connected
with a stranger or' Spanish appearance
Been lurking In the vicinity during the
preceding day and night of the flr'st ex
plosion, the theory that the work was
that of a Spanish spy rapidly gained cred
ence.
Deputy Sheriff Frayer accepted this
theory and went to work on the clews in
his possession; and "Government Secret
Service .Agents labored for weeks, but
fruitlessly. Nevertheless, a guard of men
was placed around the plant, and later,
when the Santa Cruz establishment was
wrecked by the force of its own confined
power, the military was ordered to duty
to protect these, suppliers of powder from
thq act.Â« of either the depraved, the traitor
or the spy.
Tho days through which these plants
v. i re guarded passed, and in the mean
time Anders, whoso misfortunes have
been cited, commenced suit against the
powder company to recover $iu,UOO dam
ages tor the injuries he sustained. In his
complaint! as aforesaid, he passed aside
the theory of foul play and held the com
pany's employes to blame. He accused
them of incompetence and carelessness,
claiming that the second explosion was
â  aused by the striking of a faucet on a
nitro-glycerin tank with a hammer, and
averred thai the work of clearing away
the debris from the first explosion was
improperly performed. In the answer
these allegations were denied, and though
tl;>- theory that the damage, death
and injury were caused by a Spanish spy
or traitor was not incorporated in the
pleadings; they ent> N r largely into the de
fense of the suit. Such a defense is the
lirst of its kind since the sinking of the
Maine, but doubtless it .will be brought up
many times before the memory of such
explosions will have been forgotten.
The suit Instituted by Anders was as
signed to Judge Daingertield for trial. It
was taken up a few days ago, but argu
ments on legal technicalities prevented
the introduction of material evidence.
These have now been disposed of and the
case is under progress. Yesterday after
noon the matter of evidence was again
taken up and the deposition of Captain
\V. K. Quinan, prominent in the manage
ment of the powder works, was read. In
this deposition the theory and proofs to
bark the theory of the witness that the
explosion was due to foul play was
l>n>ught out. E. S. Pillsbury, who repre
sents the company, read the deposition
and it was listened to with great interest
by the jury which must determine the
liability of the company for the plain
tiff's injuries. The testimony of the wit
ness related particularly to the theory
of foul play and in answer to the first
question put by Mr. Pillsbury was to thÂ«
effect that the first explosion took place
in the tubs containing the slums. Con
tinuing on this line, the testimony of tht
witness, in question and answer form, is

two concussions at different times, except from
â  what people told you?
A. That Is all; just .from the testimony of
others. \
Mr PlllsburyâWell, from your Inspection as
to theseâ to this locality and-these two cir
] cumstances âwhat would be your opinion as to
whether or not there were two explosions?
A. I should be Inclined to think that there
! would be two; It would be almost Impossible
for those thingsâthey were separated say by
about ten feet verticallyâeight feet, I guess,
would be a better estimate, and possibly twelve
or fifteen feet horizontally; It would be almost
I Impossible to get them to go at exactly the
same moment. :â -"."'â 
Q. Now state what other extraneous circum
stances, If any, you found showing; an ex
planation of the first explosion, or how it came
about; you spoke of- this fuse that was shown
you.
I A. Well. I don't think I quite understand the
question: that was my leason for believingâ
that was the best reason I have for believing that
âin the first place from my knowledge of the
position of things, an explosion was very Im
probable, very unlikely, and yet we know that
an explosion took place, and the fuse was
found, and it served to convince me that it was
simply a matter of foul play- Though I think
I might state that this was during the war,
the Spanish war, and . me suspicious charac
ters had been seen around the works.'
Mr. PowersâWell, you did not see any of
| them yourself?
A. Yes. 1 did. I beg your pardon,
i Q. Well, that is all right, but I intend to
object to thine anybody told you about it.
j that you did not see yourself.
i. Mr. Plllr.buryâJust state what you know of
I your own knowledge in regard to that, captain.
A. Well. I had my attention called to a rather
odd-looking character, Spanish in appearance,
i one morning at the station, by a railroad
I hrakeman. It Is pretty hard, Mr. PlllHbury,
Ito sayâof course there were a good many
things that a man knows positively, and yet
he cannot say. Now I had only this brake
. man's story to call my attention to the man,
but If I am to be headed oft in retard to
j what the brakeman told me, why then you
might say that there was nothing- suspicious
in the circumstance.
Q. Well, was there tiny other person?
A. Well, we found after the explosion in go
ing around the worksâl found a place where
j our wire fence, which had been put up to keep
all Intruders out. with the help of guards at
the entrancesâ found the wire fence cut with
nippers at a certain jiolnt.
; Q. Well, how could you account for that ex-
I cept that it was done by some Intruder?
A. Well, I had no other explanation for It.
' Our own men would have no object in cutting
the wire fence, because they could go out and
I In without any trouble. .
: Q. Well, please state whether there was any
I occasion. if you know, for the workmen going
1 through there.
A. No. sir.
Q. Now as to the material in those tuba;
state whether or not In your opinion and from
your experience as a powder man an explosion
could take, place from those extraneous causes.
A. I consider It perfectly safe: there was a
large amount of water In It. the amount of
nlrto-glycerln was small and there was noth
ing dangerous In it.
So it. will be se*n that it is the opinion
I of the witness none other than "extran
-1 eous influences'" caused the explosion, and
: the "extraneous Influences" are meant to
be the act? of either a traitor or a Spanish
spy. Conclusive proof of this theory re
-1 mains to be produced. As the theory "must
be proved by truths much has to be done,
and it might be said that as truth Is
stranger than fiction the matters sur
rounding the explosion are stranger than
both. â¢ â¢

The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus

with over 150 passengers. The run was
made in the fast time of 6 days 1 hour and
21 minutes and was uneventful, with the
exception of the. shooting of Gelespie, a
waiter, by Wade, the cook, and the shoot
ing of the latter by Chief of Police Evans
of Honolulu.
The hospital ship Solace was in port at
Honolulu when the Australia left. She
arrived there on May 15, and was to coal
as quickly as possible and proceed to San
Francisco. She has a large number of
invalids and time-expired soldiers aboard,
and also Hrigadier General Charles King.
The general was to have come up from
Manila on the Sheridan, but changed his

first. Lieutenants Minett and Gorgas of

: the Solace.
The. Harbor Â«"' mmissioners again re

casion the bids were too high and not
properly segregated. On that occasion the
bidders offered to supply lumber at
$13 75 the thousand feet. Yesterday they
unkn! $24 the thousand feet. On that oc
casion they asked 15 cents per lineal foot
fur plies, and yesterday they demanded
19 reins per foot for the same article. It
did not take the Commissioners long to
decide upon what to do. All the bids
were rejected.
Since the nien of economy began there
has been a saving of $3340 a month on the
front. The secretary reported yesterday
that the pay roll shows a decrease of

Chief Wharfinger Henderson reported

MISS SCHOMBERG'S PERIL
A STRUGGLE FOR LIFE IN A
LAWYERS OFFICE.
The Lady's Attorney, Hugh S. Aid
rich, Finds Many Mementoes
of the Contest in His
Waiting Room.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, May 23.
"Murder! Murder! Police! Police!"
m the oilice of At-
THE STRUGGLE FOR THE PISTOL.
torney Hugh 6. Aldrlch In the Blake &
Moffltt block to-day rapidly drew a crowd
into the corridors. By the time Professor
Knowlton, Janitor Spencer and others
had reached the office door a man and a
woman struggling violently for the pos
session of a pistol came into the passage
and continued their scuffling. The ap
pearance of several men caused the man
to throw down his pistol and make his
escape as - ion as possible. The lady re
tired into the attorney's office.
The woman, who declares she came
near being murdered, is Miss Eliza
Schomlu-rg, a servant in some family at
Frultvale. Her assailant was Frank
Mott, a gripman on the San Pablo avenue
road. The details of the incident, as told
by Attorney Aldrich, make it very plain
that jc-alousy is at the bottom of the at
tempted tragedy.
Miss Schomberg' met Mott several years:
ago and the two have been very Intimate
friends. The lady loaned Mott $20, and
recently he asked for an additional loan
of $200.
Miss Schomberg being acquainted with
Attorney Aldrich called on him this noon
to discuss the advisability of loaning her
lover any more money. The attorney was
out, and while the woman was waiting
Frank Mott entered the office. He at once
demanded of her that she should con
tinue to be as good a friend to him as j
during the last ten years. 'From his lan
guage he seemed to Infer that taking
legal advice as to the loan was equivalent
to casting him aside. Miss Schomberg
says that he produced a pistol and told
her that if she were thinking of leaving <
him he would kill her and then kill him
self on the spot. She rushed at him, at
tempting to grab the pistol, and being a
powerful woman she was able to prevent !
him using it until she had pushed him I
into the hall, when Others came to her aid. !
The struggle was very tierce, as was
shown by the fact that the pistol was
"broken" during the contest and some of i
the cartridges fell on the Boor, where they
were found by Attorney Aidrich. In his ;
flight Mott picked up his gun and took it
with him. Reminiscences of the struggle ,
were seen all over the office of the attor
ney, and some of the bystanders took
away fragments of the lady's broken
hair comb as souvenirs of the occasion.
Frank Mott was arrested to-night and
brought to the City Prison, charged with
carrying a concealed weapon, His bail
was fixed at $100, which be was unable to I
furnish. Mis version of the affair at At
torney Aldrich'a office this afternoon va
ries materially from the story told by
Miss Schomberg.
"Tills woman has been pestering the j
life out of me to marry her. " said Mott,
"and because I cannot see my way clear
to accommodate her she is trying to make
trouble for me. We have been very Inti
mate friends, but, you see, I've got a
wife and two children back in Illinois, so
I couldn't very well marry Miss Schom
berg. My wife and I separated several
years asm because we' could not get along
well together.
"Miss Schomberg has been trying to in
duce me to secure a divorce, and this aft
ernoon she went to Attorney Aldrich's
office to ascertain whether I had com- '
menced proceedings. In doing this she
interfered with my affairs and I got sick ;
of it, and so I followed her up and made
a bluff to scare her off. I had my revol
ver, unloaded, in my pocket. I did not
draw it. and made no attempt to injure
her, but just as soon as she saw me she ;
save a scream and ran out of the office.
1 have never asked her for a cent, but she
has frequently demanded money of me.
If she intends to make further trouble for
me in this way I guess I can fire back
and make trouble for her as well."

THE REAPER CLAIMS A
PIONEER ARCHITECT
WILLIAM PATTON DIES AT HIS
HOME IN ALAMEDA.
ALAMEDA, May 23.â William Patton,
one of the pioneer architects of the Pa
cific Coast, who designed a portion of
San Francisco's new City Hall, died this
morning at his home. 2253 Central avenue,
Alameda. He had been ill for a number
of months, suffering from cancer of the
throat, and his death had been expected
daily. Deceased was a native of Sunder
land, England, aged 7S years. When a boy
he entered an architect's office and served
his apprenticeship. When news of the
gold discoveries in California reached the
old country he wa.s among the first to
start for the new El Dorado. He came
around the Horn in the same vessel with
Thomas Blythe, and Die two were fast
friends up to the time of the latter's
death.
After passing several years in the mines
Mr. Patton returned to San Francisco
and opened an architect's office on Wash
ington street, where he followed his pro
â¢ n with great success and amassed
a fortune, part of which, however, was
lost in late years by unprofitable specu
lation. Mr. Patton married in San Fran
cis* <>. About twenty years ago he built
his home at 2853 Central avenue and took
up his residence in Alameda.
Many of 'San Francisco's early land
marks were designed by Mr. Patton.
Some of them have since been turn down
while others are still standing monu
ments to the architect's skill. Among
the San Francisco buildings designed by
him are the Sutter-street Synagogue the
Safe Deposit building, Donahue block.
Mission and Fremont streets; the old
Starr King church, since replaced by the
new structure; thp old chronicle^buliding,
Hush and Kearny streets, and me Alca
zar building. He was supervising archi
tect of the new City Hall, and designer
of the northwest and northeast wings, the
City Prison and the Hall of Records.
Many of the tlnr-st buildings in Alameda
were also designed by him.
Mrs. Patton died. about fourteen yearn
ago. Two sons, William and Clarence
Patton, survive the father. Deceased was
a member of the Society of California
Pioneers. The funeral services will be
held under the auspices of the society.

STRUCK BY A LOCAL.
His Pegleg Caught and Aged Edward
Walker Fell in Front of the
Locomotive.
OAKLAND, May Edward Walker,
aged 79 years and an inmate of the San
Francisco Almshouse, was struck by the
new broadgauge local at the narrow
gauge mole this afternoon and may die
from his injuries.
Walker's left leg consists of a stump
fixed in a peg strapped to his thigh. In
some manner this peg became fastened
between the boards near the track and
Walker fell in front of the locomotive.
At the Receiving Hospital he was treat
ed by Dr. Stratton for a fractured left
thigh and arm and numerous serious
bruises about the head. Though he seemed
to be conscious all the while his chances
for recovery are considered meager owing
to his advanced age. Walker stated In
whispers that he had intended walking to
Santa Clara.
An Appeal for Funds.
The committee of the Native Sons of
the Golden West of the California volu
teer medal fund has through John T.
Greany, the chairman, and Frank B.
Hyan, the secretary, issued an appeal tv
the subordinate parlors of the order to
lend their assistance in raising the money
required, namely, between $12,000 and $15,-
OfiO. to procure the medals that are to be
donated to the California volunteers upon
THE SA:N FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 24, 1899.
their return to their native soil. The ap
peal concludes in these words: "The
committee will expect to hear from your
parlor in a substantial way in the near
future The occasion calls for prompt
action, and in the words of the grand
president, 'Let every Native Son do his
duty." "
FAIR CASE DELAYED.
Supreme Court Ordered thÂ© Appeals
Resubmitted.
After all the litigation as to the two
â wills of James Q. Fair, there Is yet an
other delay. Yesterday the Supreme
Court made the following order:
Charles L. Fair vs. James S. Ag^ius
et al.
In the ahove entitled appeals, one
of the Justices of this court not hav
ing hoard the arguments and there
fore being disqualified to participate in
the decisions thereof, and it being
deemed important that all the Jus
tices should participate. It is order, d
that the submission of said appeals be
set aside and that they be resubmitted
to the full court. As the briefs on
these appeals are very elaborate and
as several of the oral arguments made
at the hearing have been printed and
are on file, counsel for the several
parties may stipulate if they so desire
to immediately resubmit the cases on
the briefs and printed arguments nov;
on file; otherwise they will be placed
for argument on the next July calen
dar.
The order is lucid on Its face and re
fers to the fact that Justice Van Dyke,
who succeeded Justice Van Fleet, did not
officially hear the argument in the ap
peals. Hence their resubmlssion. There
is little doubt in the minds of attorneys
but that counsel will agree to stipulate
for the resubmlssion on the briefs on
file.

GONE, AND HIS BOOKS
MAY BE $10,000 SHORT
E. F. Spaulding, Cashier of the Fireman's
Fund Insurance Company, Unac
countably Prolongs His Vaca
tion Without Leave.
THE accounts of. Edward F.
SpauJding, assistant cashier of
the Fireman's Fund Insurance
Company of California, are nol
straight. Yesterday experts
found discrepancies in his books and
It is surmised that a shortage approxi
mating. $10,000 may be traced.
The assistant cashier should have
been at his desk in the company's of
fice at the corner of California and
Sansome streets last Monday morning.
He was due then to return to duty
Bfter his annual vacation covering a.
period of ten days. His Failure to ap
pear or report a reason for his ab
sence caused D. J. Staples, president
of the company, to direct an expert ex
amination of Mr. Bpaulding'a books.
The president was seen at his resi
dence, 711 Taylor street, last evening
and responding to Inquiries on behalf
of The Call said:
"In this affair the company has noth
ing to conceal from the public. 1 will
ray with perfect frankness that we
have found some discrepancies in the
books of Mr. Spaulding, our assistant
cashier. The report that 120,000 is miss-
Ing is all nonsense. We do not know
yet "what the amount involved is. but
do know that it cannot exceed $10,000.
It Is likely to be less than half that
amount. The fact that Mr. Spaulding
did not come to the office yesterday
caused us to look over his accounts and
some discrepancies were found.
"He went away on his annual vaca
tion recently. There was nothing ir
regular in his going away. The vaca
tion was due him according to the cus
tom of the office, which gives to the
fifty or sixty young men employed
there an annual outing of ten days. He
should, however, have reported at his
desk yesterday (Monday) morning, but
he did not appear or send word when
he would come. It was then suggested
that an examination should be made of
his books, and I say frankly that some
discrepancies were discovered. Come
to the office of the company to-morrow
and I may be able to state definitely
the extent of the discrepancies. No,
there has been no thought of placing

the affair in the hands of the police or '
of taking steps to cause the arrest of !
Mr. Spaulding."
When asked concerning the place
where Mr. Spaulding went for his va
cation Mr. Staples replied: "I do not ',
know where ho went. We scarcely in
qUire where an employe enjoys his va- ,
cation, ['understand that some of them
do not go out of the city, but stay about
home and do ;i little gardening. If a
man does not return when his vacation
expires we make inquiry concerning: his
absence. The system of allowing a va
cation Is so conducted that each man's
: for going and returning is regis- j
tered."
President Staples was asked concern
ing surety bonds to protect the com
pany from loss. Replying to this line
of inquiry, he remarked:
"We have never required bonds of |
our employes. Our business, fire and !

year. For thirty-three years 1 have
l>een at the head of the company, and j
during that entire period only two de- j
faults have occurred. Our system is |
such that an extensive loss in this re- j
spect is impossible. Our cashier, Mr. i
Wood, is away at present, and Mr. j

Spaulding is onh- the assistant.
"Yes, he is the son of that grand old
man, K. W. Spaulding. who was United
States Assistant Treasurer, Mayor of
< >akland and a prominent member of
the Republican State Central Commit
tee. If the son has gone wrong, the !
blow will be a sad one to the father,
who is an honored citizen and a most
excellent man. The assistant cashier,
Spaulding, has been in our employ
about seven years."
Bernard Faymonville. second vice i
president and secretary of the Fire
mans Fund, was seen at the com
pany's office on California street yes- \
terday afternoon. In answer to In
quiries regarding the alleged defalca
tion, he said he had not been advised
of any embezzlement or shortage.
When the amount of $20,000 was men- *
tioned he said it would have been Im
possible for the assistant cashier to
have taken that amount or any sum
approximating it.
CAPTAIN DAN
HASKELL DEAD
A WELL KNOWN PILOT AND
TOWBOAT MAN.
1 Was for Years Master of the Tug's
Alert, Belief and Fearless and
Later Became a Pilot.
Captain Daniel H. Haskell, the well
known master mariner and pilot, died at
Ills home. 1694 Page street, yesterday af
ter a lingering illness. He began to fall
nearly two years aeo, but it waa only
within the last monih or six weeks that
he to his bed. Then dropsy set In
and gradually worked Its way up to liis
heart.
Captain Haskell was one of the best
known towboat men on the Pacifiv <'<..tst.
Years ago he began his career as deck
hand on the tug Neptune. Then hÂ« was
captain of the Pa.-inV Mall tug Milieu
Crirtitli. When John D. Spreckels went
Captain " Dan " H. Haskell.
I Into the towboat business "Dan," aÂ«
â¢pveryborly called him, was madf master
of trie Alert. In ISS3, when the Relief was
built and launchr-d in the Kast. <";i.ptain
Haskell was sent to Tramps' to briiiK her
here. He brought the handsome vessel
out in record time for a vessel of her
class and remained in command of her
until the big tug Fearless was built.
When Captain Haskell had been In com-
I mand of the Fearless for a number of
i years there became a vacancy among the
pilots. Captain Trask retired and Captain
Haskell was unanimously elected to suc
c-eed him. During his career Captain
Haskell never met with an accident and
was one of the most successful men In
tbe business at picking up derelicts and
i bringing In salvage .-hips.
The Fearless, with which Captain Has
; kill was so long Identified, was sold to the
(iuvernment during the war and is now
the dispatch-boat Iroquoiw. The- Relief
and Alert are still >n commission, as Is
also The Millen (4rifflth. while the old
Neptane went to the "boneyard" long
ago.
Captain Haskell leaves a host of friends
In every walk of life and he will be very
much missed in shipping circles.
GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
FULLY UP TO STANDARD
The following letter from Professor
Elisha Brooks, principal of the Girls'
High School, is self-explanatory:
GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL.. May 20 1899.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: An article appeared
In several papers a few days ago In which some
of the statements are liable to misconstruction
which may result In serious lfcjury to the
Girls' Hlch School. It was stated "that the
course of study of this school was to be re
organized so as to bring the school up to the
standard of the I. owe]'. High School and place
It on the accredited list of the University. The
natural Inference to be drawn from this la that
this school is not accredited and is not un to
the standard of the Lowell Hiffh School.
An examination of the courses of study of
thÂ« two schools will show that thru of the
Girls' High Is not Inferior in any respect to the
other.
The published reports of the University show
that the Girls' High School has been regularly
accredited since. 1890, and the last reports gives
the following subjects in which it was fully
accredited for 1897-98:
1, English; 3, algebra; 4, plane geometry; 5,
government of United States; 6, Latin (Cae
sar, Cicero, Latin composition); 7. Latin (Cice
ro, Virgil, prosody, Latin composition); 8,
Xenophon; 9, ; Xenophon, Greek composition,
THE SAX FRANCISCO CAIX, WEDNESDAY, MAT 24, 1899.
"Mr. Spaulding was the assistant
cashier," remarked Mr. Faymonville,
"and he was not authorized to draw
checks or drafts. Mr. Spaulding's desk
is in the general office on this floor.
The cash is chiefly handled in the city
department on the floor below. The
remittances by mail come in the form
of checks and drafts and everything is
checked up for banking daily. No, I
do not know where Mr. Spaulding
passed his vacation. This is the first I
have heard of any defalcation or crook
edness. If anything has been ab
stracted the amount must be very
small â surely not more than two or
three thousand dollars."
Inquiry was made in Oakland last
evening, but appearances indicated
that the assistant cashier had fled. Ac
cording to the statement of his broth
er's wife, E. F. Spaulding and his fam
ily moved to Oakland a short time ago
and took up their residence at 1664
Webster street. Mrs. Spaulding. the
sister-in-law mentioned, declared that
she does not know where her husband's
brother has gone, more than that he
left home a week or ten days ago to
take his usual vacation. She stated
that he was accompanied by his wife.
Inquiry as to the direction taken by
the couple was of no avail, the lady
claiming that she knew nothing of
Spaulding's business or where he and
his wife had gone for their vacation.
An inspection of the house last occu
pied by the Spauldings at 1664 Webster
street indicated that it had been closed
for sevetal days, and the neighbors
seemed to be In ignorance of the
whereabouts or movements of the last
occupants. The family had gone was
all they seemed to know about -the
matter, and the time of the departure
was variously estimated at from one
to two weeks.
Thomas M. Gardiner, cashier of the
Fireman's Fund Insurance Company,
t^p whose department Mr. Spaulding
was attached, resides on the heights of
East Oakland, overlooking the estuary.
Inquiry at his residence last night was
barren of results. A maid serva*** vhn
answered a ring at the door did not
think Mr. Gardiner could b.- seen. >\nc.i
pressed to announce the presence of a
reporter she retired, returning shortly
with the information that Mr. Gardiner
could not be seen and would answer no
questions.

The decision of ihp University for this year
i has not yet been rendered In regard to any of
I the schools of the State, but we have no anx
iety as to the result.
We invite an investigation of the compara
tive standing of nur graduates in the Univer
sity, feeling confident that the result will be
greatly to the credit of the Girl's High School.
The Ixiwril and the Girls' High schools have
an equal standing with the University of < 'hi
e-ago, being accredited by that Institution, and
having the distinction of being the only schools
west of the Rocky Mountains so accredited.
The Girls' High School 1b also accredited by
Ya.tMar College, and Is. 1 believe, the only
srho-4 weft of tbe Rockies Â»o honored.
\\ c welcome any movement for raising the
standard of all the high schools, especially the
movement for a four years' course, which 1
have Hdvocated for several years, and urged
1 upon the preeent board, and the faculty of this
school Is In hearty accord with the Board of
I-Mui-atlon In this matter.
The fHculty and the pupils of this school ask
that as full publicity as possible be given this
Hatement, so that the incorrect impression
that the school Is not accredited may nnt gain
currency and Inflict great Injury on us.

A NEGRO COOK
RUNS AMUCK ON
THE AUSTRALIA
Shot a Waiter and
Was Shot Himself.
WAS DRIVEN CRAZY bY DRINK
WOUNDED AND DYING TAKEN
BACK TO HONOLULU.
The Steamer Was Under Way for San
Francisco When the Lunatic
Began Using His Pistol
With Deadly Effect.
George Wade, chief cook of the steamer
Australia, ran amuck shortly after the
vessel left Hawaii on May 16. He armed
himself with a bulldog revolver and fatal-

ly wounded G. W. Gelesple, one of the
waiters, drove a number of the crew Into
i hiding, and the only thing that stopped
i his wild career was a bullet from a Wln
j Chester rirle in the hands of Harry Evans,
Chief of Police of Honolulu.
A man named Sherman victimized near
ly all the business men in Honolulu and
finally succeeded In yetting $150 out of
Chief Justice Judd. The latter was on
the bench, when he heard that Sherman
was trying to get away on the Australia,
so he at once issued a warrant for his
arrest and adjourned court to see that
the document was served. That was how
it happened that Chief of Police Evans
was aboard the steamer. He went out
with the vessel, intending to return with
the pilot, and was searching for his man
in company with Purser McCombe and
<'hief Steward Seeley when the shooting
I began.
The Australia sailed from Honolulu at
i 4 p. m. About half an hour before that
! time Chief Cook Wade had gone aboard
i drunk and quarrelsome. He was sent to
his room and told to take a good sleep.
He was not seen again until 1:35 p. m.,
when the Australia was outside the reef
and the pilot was preparing to leave the
ship. At tha.t time Wade accosted Harry
! Heed in the port alleyway and said he was
i going to "do up" somebody. At that
moment Chief Steward Seeley passed, and
Wade glared after him and said to Reed,
"I'll kill that fellow before the day is
out." Keed tried to persuade the drunken
cook to go back to his room, but Wade
drove him off with the pistol.
John I. Taylor, the baker, was the next
to run across the crazy man. Wade near
ly scared him to death by firing off the
pistol and asking him: "Are you with
me? I'm going to kill half this ship's
; crew." "I'm with you! I'm with you."
said Taylor, and then ran for his life.
I Sydney C. Boyd. the butcher, came along
â  and he did not bandy any words but
struck Wade a blow that dazed htm for a
moment. Wade made a rush at Boyd
and the latter grasped his arm to pre
; vent him from shooting, and in the scuffle
the pistol went off. Gelespie and Thomas
i Breslin went to Boyd's assistance, but
1 the crazy n'-gro was more than a match
j for them. He got his iirm free and shot
i Gelespie in the left thigh, shattering the
I bone. The wounded man fell to the floor
: and Boyd and Breslin ran into ihe engi
neer's room.
When the two men ran Wade gathered
himself together and, looking down at
Gelespie as lie lay on the deck, said:
"Sydney, you struck me, and I'm going:
to kill you."
"I'm not Sydney." groaned Gelespie. '
"I don't care; you're one of the gang,
and I'm goint; to kill you."- yelled Wade.
With that he fired, the bullet striking
' Gelespie in the left groin and passed
through his hip. Wade then retired to
j his room and reloaded his revolver.
When the cook came out again he pro
j ceeded along the alley in search of Chief
: Steward Seeley. When he reached the
galley he saw Chief of Police Evans on
i the starboard side of the ship and took a
I shot at him. In the meantime, Chief
' Officer Lawless, who was forward, had
â  been Informed of the shooting, and he at
j once reported to Captain Houdlette. The
: latter counseled caution, but told the chief
i officer to secure the maniac at all haz
ards. Lawless went to his room, loaded
his Winchester and thus armed started
I out to look for Wade. On the way he met
Chief of Police Evans, and the latter took
the gun out of Lawless' hands. When
BUTCHERS WILL
PICNIC TO - DAY
AT SHELL MOUND
An Enjoyable Outing
Is Anticipated.
THOUSANDS WILL ATTEND
SPEEDY HORSES WILL COKTfETE
FOR BIG PURSES.
Well-Known Meat-Dealers to Handle
the Ribbons, With Heavy Bet
ting on the Various
Events.
Woe will betide the houperrife who did
not lay In her supply of meat yesterday.
This Is hutrhfrs' day, and all the
knights of the cleaver and their employes
and families are to celebrate. Every
butcher-shop in this city and also In Oak
land, Berkeley and Alameda is closed, and
the entire meat trade, from the cattle
king to the boys hauling hides In the
smallest tanyard, are prepared to join In
the reunion that yearly brings the mem
bers of the Butchers' Board of Trade and
their friends together.
This Is the sixth celebration that the
butchers have indulged in. It marks the
sixth year of their declaration of inde
pendence of the meat barons, and to them
tells of a long and hard fight against the
millions of a trust that has gripped the
butcher-shops of every large city in the
United States except San Francisco.
This year's celebration is to be even
more elaborate than usual. There are to
be horse races at the Oakland track and
dancing, foot races and games at Shell
Mound. One ticket will admit the bearer
to both pleasure parks and also give the
picnicker a chance at a large, miscellan
eous collection of gate prizes, chief of
which is a purse of $100 in gold. The sec
ond prize, which Is to be of five $10 gold
pieces, will also be worth carving horn*.
An unusual feature of the faces will be
two dashes of professional runners, for
which the Butchers' Board of Trade Is to
hang up interesting purses. The entries
for these races are as follows:
One mile dashâFaversham 96, Alvin E
113, Dare II 116, Maginis 109, The Plunger
111. Alvero 113.
Three-quarter mile dashâPueniah 97
Homestake 109, Florence Fink 97, Somis 97
Crawford 111. Tom Smith 111, Silver State
109, Loch Ness 114, Master Lee 97, Road
warmer 111, Durward 111. Spry Lark 10!)
Uncle True 109, Inverness II 114.
Of course, there are to be races for the
butchers, races for the vaqueros and
races for the butcher boys. As there Is
much pride felt in their horses and their
skill as ' drivers by the different retail
merchants, the races In which they par
ticipate will have a double interest.
Last year's crowd exceeded 24,000. Even
more people are expected this year, since
more preparations have been made to en
tertain them and more opportunities are
offered for them spending every hour of
the day In enjoyment.

Wade saw them coming he fired his pistol
and the bullet whistled between the two
men, making both of them duck. Evans
did not give him time to lire again, but,
raising the Winchester, sent a bullet
crashing into Wade's head. It struck the
frontal bone and was turned aside. plow
ing its way through the bone and flesh,
making a deep furrow. ,;:. -
The insane cook was only partly
stunned, and In spite of his.wound he had
to be handcuffed and manacled before he
would keep quiet. In the meantime Dr.
H. J. McNulty. the ship's surgeon, had
been in attendance upon Gelespie and had
dressed his wounds. He then went to the
cook, but could do nothing for him. Both
the wounded men were taken on deck
lowered Into the pilot boat and taken
ashore. '
