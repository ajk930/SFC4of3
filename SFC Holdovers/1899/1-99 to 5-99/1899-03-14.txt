VOLUME LXXXV-NO. 10*.
INGLESIDE'S EVIL REIGN IS
ENDED BY THE SUPERVISORS
The reign of the race-track gamblers has closed in San Francisco. The solemn protest of every decent element of the city has been answered by
the Board of Supervisors and bookmaking and poolselling within the limits of the city are prohibited by authority of law. The blackleg invaders, who
brought in their train to San Francisco the manifold evils of vice, must ply their trade elsewhere.
Ingleside may keep open its gates, but the hazard of a dollar on a horse race to-day means the commission of a misdemeanor and the penalty
of a fine and an imprisonment. The Supervisors were true to their trust. They were proof against the allurements of the gamblers and by a majority of
nine votes made the great measure a law. The Board won a most unusual tribute of commendation from Mayor Phelan, who signed the ordinance the
instant that it had received the official sanction of the Supervisors. - .
Through their official representatives the people of San Francisco have won a victory that means much to the most sacred interests of the
community. The pulpit, the press, agents of good and men and women of every reputable class will welcome the doom of the gamblers as the dawn of
THE people of San Francisco have
won their battle against the cor
rupting, degrading, criminal ex
istence of the bookmakers and
poolsellers. The Supervisors have
honored themselves as the official rep
resentatives of the moral elements of
the city and have made gambling. on
horseracing and coursing in this city
and county a criminal offense. Mayor
Phelan has signed the new ordinance,
and with his signature has made the
law operative. Any bookmaker that
accepts a wager atlngleside to-day will
be arrested, fined or imprisoned. or both
fined and imprisoned for his violation
of the law. Any poolseller that plies
his vicious trade will be sought out and
punished. The people of San Francisco
have won a splendid triumph ever a
gigantic evil, whose devastating power
grew greater as the years passed.
The victory is one achieved by many
forces organized for a common
cause. The warning words of
clergymen were heard in a score
of pulpits on Sunday night. The
warning was heeded, and those that
spoke have now the knowledge of suc
cess well Wen in a worthy cause. Mer
chants contributed their solemn plea
for themselves and for those in their
service. Workingraen spoke for their
families and. their homes. The police
added the terrible story of their expe
rience with the evils of the race course
and convict cells gave their testimenvof
dread to arraign th curs? of the course.
The Call recorded the daily tragedies
of wrecked lives and ruined homes, the
pitiable trophies of the ramblers of the
track. With a common impulse these
factors combined their forcÂ° of pleading
for â  i-<ir<-. and the Supervisors an
swered with the law that will rid the
city of the spay.-â . of Ki^cklecs that with
their presence brought defilement to
lives and homes.
The Bcene It. the chamber of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday after
noon was an Impressive one. Clergy
men, merchants, worl-cingmen. repre
sentatives of th best elements of the
city, were there to lend the dignity
' a nd the encou â orient of their-pres
ence. The shabby followers of the
race course were there too in eager
curiosity to learn the fate of their
masters. Supervisor Perrault. to
â¢whom so much la due for the enact
ment of the new law. asked a suspen
sion of the rules and an immediate
consideration of the ordinance against
bookmaking and pool selling. The re
quest was heartily granted and Super
visor Perrault called for a vote on final
adoption.
There was a critical moment nf hesi
tancy, and then a gentleman sitting
r.^ar Supervisor Holland arose and
asked to be heard. He was Qreen. the j
secretary of Ingleside. Before he
spoke the Supervisors decided that
speeches must be limited to a few :
minutes. This decision was unnecea- ;
sary, although Supervisor Holland de
dared that he needed light Mr. Green
â poke briefly and painfully. He wanted
â¢what The Call predicted he would want
â delay. He said that great property
interests were involved at Ingleside.
that much money was invested there i
and that many people earned their 1
daily bread in their service to the .
track.
Mr. Green declared, with absolute j
truth, that he was a poor pleader and j
that in justice to Ingleside the Super- i
visors ought to postpone action until
the president of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club, ex-State Senator Androus,
could be heard. Mr. Androus, so the
secretary said, was unavoidably out of
town.
"But." interjected Supervisor Per- j
rault, "doesn't Sam Rainey look after
the interests of the association in the
absence of the president?"
"I don't know about that," was the
reply.
"Well, I do," said Supervisor Per
rault, and that ended the discussion.
As a matter of fact Mr. Androus was
out of town. He went away, he said,
to think, and it is believed that he is
thinking yet. While he was away Sam j
Rainey and Phil Crimmins were also |
thinking in a prominent Market street j
resort. They were thinking of a new
era in municipal politics and of the
dawn of decency in public affairs.
When Secretary Green concluded his j i
talk to the members of the board there
â was again an awkward silence. It was ,
thought that the gamblers would fight
more stubbornly. But no one spoke for ,
the giant evil and the vote of the Su
b was called and taken.

Supervisor Kalben asked to be ex
cused. He said he did not dare offend
the friends or the enemies of the gam- :
blera by voting either way. He was '
excused. Supervisor Black voted no.

ussembly chamber rang with applause
hat no one cared to silence.
Supervisor Perrault asked Mayor
'helan to sign the ordinance. The
Â»layor motioned to the clerk and
xasped a pen. In an instant the signa
ure of the city's chief executive was
n the ordinance, and the city's great
iattle had been won. It was little won
er that the clergymen in the audience
vere perhaps the most demonstrative
n their tribute, for the signature of
rlayor Phelan means much to the
omes of San Francisco.
The proceedings were of such im
iortance that a stenographic report is

COrder read by the clerk.)
The Mayorâ The order is on its final
passage. Who moves that it be finally ]
passed?
Mr. Aigel lingerâ l do.
Mr. Perraultâ l second the motion.
The Mayor â The question is now before
the board on final passage. Is there any
objection?
Mr. Blackâ l move that we hear from
Mr. Green, the secretary of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club.
Mr. Perrault â I move to amend that we
limit all talk on this subject to about five
minutes.
Mr. Hollandâ l move that the gentleman
I be allowed to speak as long as he pleases.
! This is a serious question â one that af
{ fects all classes of society, and we cannot
perhaps have all the light needed on this
subject in five minutes.
The Mayorâ Do you object to thÂ©
amendment for a five minutes' limit?
Mr. Hollandâ Yes, sir.
The Mayorâ lt has been moved and reg
i ulariy seconded that the remarks of Mr.
I Green" and others who may be invited to
! uddress the board be limited to five min
utes each. Are you ready for the ques
tion?
Mr. Aigeltingerâ l don't think we ou;:ht I
to r eatrlct this to five minutes. Give !
everybody a fair and impartial hearing, ;
| and then let us Judge for ourselves.
Mr. Lackmann- 1 also object to that
motion to limit to five minutes: This is a I
very srrious question to these gentlemen, j
and I believe in giving them all the time |
they want. If their talk extends over five
minutes, ten minutes or fifteen minutes I
I am perfectly satisfied to hear all they
have to say.
Mr. Perraultâ l withdraw the amend
ment.
Mr. Greenâ l appear hefore you, gen
tlemen, to-day on behalf of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club to ask that this mat
ter be laid over for a sufficient length of
time to enable us to present our side of j
the case. Mr. Crocker, our vice president. I
unfortunately is HI and unable to be here.
Mr. Androus, our president, is not in the
j city, and they are unable to appear be
i fore you at this time. There are large
[ Interests at stake, and it is no more than
right that more time should be given to
the consideration of this matter. The
Pacific Coast Jockey Club has a large
amount of money invested in this prop
erty at Ingleside, and a great many peo-
I pie are dependent for their daily bread
; upon the salaries that they are now draw- !
i ing there. All we ask a.nd all we have
I asked from this board is an opportunity
of presenting our side of the case.
Mr. Lackmannâ Mr. Gret-n, can't you or
your association have the opportunity to
rlo that here to-day? This was passed to 1
[ print a week ago, and It seems to me ]
that provision could have been made to ]
present this to-day, or to appear before '
the board with any arguments that you !
may have to present.
Mr. Greenâ As I say. our president is
out of town, and Mr. Crocker, our vice
president, who is largely interested in the
property, has been too ill to attend to the ,
matter. They have asked me to appear :
before you and ask for a postponement
of this matter. I see no necessity of i
rushing the matter through. It seems no
more than right that we should be given
an opportunity for a hearing.
Mr. Lackmann- Could not your presi
dent have been here to-day?
Mr. Greenâ No, sir.
Mr. Lackmannâ He had a whole week to
get ready to appear here.
Mr. Perraultâ ln his absence, were not
his interests looked after well and active
ly by Mr. Sam Kainey?
Mr. Greenâ l don't know about that.
Mr. Perraultâ Well. I say yes: I know
It. Question.
The Mayorâ Are you ready for the ques
tion on final passage of the order? The
clerk will call the roll.
The clerk then called the name of Mr.
Holland, who said: "This is a very seri
ous question, and I think we should hear
both sides. They have large interests at
stake, here, and so has the public large
interests at stake. I am ready to vote
for the resolution, but at the same time
I am in favor of all kinds of legitimate
sport. There is no one who will deny
that horse racing, as carried on at pres
ent, has deteriorated from the purpose of
encouraging the industry of raising fine
horses in this State. I consider the lat
ter is as great and legitimate an industry
as the making of raisins or wine. It is
one of our great industries, and has beer*
so recognized by .our Legislature In mak
ing provision for the State fair. I hope
the Legislature will continue to recognize
It by devoting a week each year to speed
contests between California-bred horses
alone, so that we can show to the world
by the records they make that we have
in California the best country in the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
world for raising 1 fast horses. At any
time, if an order be framed here that will
legalize horse-racing to be carried on le
gitimately and in such a way as to ex
clude boys and grirls from attendance up
on races, and will honestly stimulate and
encourage the raising of such horses. I
shall be in favor of it and will vote for
it, even if it is next Monday. I will vote
for the present resolution.
Mr. Kal'uen. when his name was called,
said: "Mr. Mayor and gentlemen: I have
this thing- up a little bit and I
find that I cannot vote for the resolution.
My only reason isâ and I .can explain it
to you here â that my business does not
allow me to do so; therefore I would
rather not vote at all than to be recorded
as voting."
Mr. Black voted no without remark,
and Messrs. Perrault, Lackmann. Bying
ton, Collins. Heyer, Deasy, Attridge and
Aigeltinger aye.
The Mayor declared the resultâ 9 ayes,
1 no. 1 fxciisrd, 1 (Mr. Phelps) absent, and
the resolution finally passed, whereat the
lobby applauded.
Mr. Perraultâ On behalf of this commu
nity I now request the Mayor to attach
his signature to that order and have It
! become- a law at once.
The Mayorâ l wUI give the order my
host attention. I do not hesitate to say
that I approve of it. and have no objec
tion to signing it now.
The Mayor then attached, his signature,
the crowded lobby applauding heartily.
At the conclusion of the meeting
Mayor Phelan and every member Qf the
board were interviewed in reference to
th great public duty which they had
| performed. Supervisor Phelps was not
i present at thp meeting, did not vote
and consequently was not interviewed.
In what follows the people of San Fran
cisco may see clearly how deeply the
Mayor and the Supervisors felt the re
sponsibility of their position.
MVYOR JAMES D. PHELAJf 1
dinned the ordinance of the Super
visors, having been requested to do
so by Supervisor Perranlt in open
board, nnd because I waa familiar
with the order and needed no time
to consider it.
There was an attempt made last
year to limit the raring season In
I this city to a certain number of
| weeks â I forjret the exact period,
nix or eight weeks and It whs then,
with a certain amount of reason,
objected to by the managers of
Ingleslde track, that as the regula
tion would only apply to them It
would give the Oakland track all
| the business without relieving the
people of San Francisco, on account
of the proximity of Oakland, of any
of the evils of which complaint Is
made. It was tacitly understood at
that time that the legislature
j would be asked to regulate the Â«ea
i son so It would apply to all tracks
alike. This, as I said, appeared
reasonable, but when the bills were
submitted to the Legislature they
were opposed â  and failed to pass.
Therefore the Board of Supervisors
had to begin the regulation of the
evil on their own account.
It Is true that the passage of this
order will not in any way interfere
with the selling of pools in other
counties adjacent to San Francisco,
but it may serve as an example and
i an object lesson. Certainly if the
selling of pools is a detriment to the
morals and business of San Fran
cisco, it Is equally Injurious to the
business and morals of other places.
In New York and other Eastern
States the Legislature has limited
the period of racing to a certain
nnmber of weeks, which I think: Is
the true solution of the question,
and if our Legislature had done so
and the managers of the race tracks
co-operated, as they promised last
year, there might not have been any
necessity for this stringent order.
The length of the season encour
aged people to make a regular busi
ness of attendance on the races, and
the sport degenerated into gam
bling, and as a result we find the
greatest demoralisation. Vast num
bers of people made a business of
i gambling, and I suppose that 99 per
cent of them lost their earnings and
their savings. The practice discour
aged honest toll, prevented the
smaller merchants from collecting
their bills for the necessities of life
supplied to families, and was no
doubt the cause of poverty, suicide
and crime.
The breeding and the racing of
horses can be carried on -without
the bookmakers. If there were a
short season the people would pat
ronize liberally the track for the
J sake of the sport; and prises conld
be offered as an incentive to the
owners to enter their horses. The
fees for entry and a percentage of
the gate receipts would be ample
for the prizes, and when the Park
Panhandle Is extended and other
boulevards laid out our people will
purchase well-bred horses for their
own pleasure, thus making a mar
ket where none now exists.
It Is not only a matter of morals,
but la a matter of Inilueii. TJÂ»Â«2
merchants have been complaining;
loudly about the diversion of money
into the pockets of the bookmakers
â by this meant It is lost to city and
State. The Inability of men. here
tofore of good credit, to nay their
bills, and the general demoraliza
tion,: smaller in degree but similar
in kind, is like the fever which ex
isted 'during the "wildcat" stock ex
citement of the last generation. For
these reasons, mid on account of my
familiarity with the case made by
the managers of the race track,
which was presented to me ofllcially
last year, I was ready to, and did.
sign this order as soon as it passed.
It Is unusual to sign an order so
promptly.' As a. general proposition
I take the time : the law allows for
the purpose of hearing objections.
I would like to point out the folly
of the Board of Management of the
race track in not listen to the
advice of the Board of Supervisors
of last year and having: the legis
lature pass a law limiting the sea
ton to a certain nnmber of weeks.
"We have the opera season and
everybody attends, deriving enjoy
ment and musical education. If we
had grand opera for ? six months
very few could afford to attend, and
very "few would be tempted to at
tend because there would be no
season. They would defer going un
til .the end, and perhaps not go at
all. The very frequency of the
operas- would surfeit them. Where
as, now. by having a "limited season,
everybody goes as a matter of taste
or ' fashion, pays for the privilege
for the season, and the box office re
ceipts enable, the management to
give the very best talent without
selling pools on the merits of the
performers. â ' Â« â â¢ â¢ ' ' - .â¢ â¢â¢'
So a well patronized season of
racing in a great city of pleasure
loving people would be acceptable
by all liberal-minded men, but they
will not accept the pillage of a
community even If \ the legitimate
sport and the breeding of horses are
urged as a reason for it. In. other
words, we are asked to pay too high
a price "for good sport. Can we not
have good sport without paying so
dearly for It? I believe we can.
SUPERVISOR PERRAULT â The
resolution passed as I was sure it
would after I heard my colleagues
express themselves on the measure.
It means much to the merchants anil
to the respectable members of so
ciety in this city. The race track
has long been, a drain on them
financially, to say nothing of its
blighting influence on all who per
mitted themselves to be drawn into
its whirlpool of infamy. The salu
tary effect of the new law should be
felt at once, as it will relieve the
tension under which many people of
this city have existed for six months
in the year for several years past.
SUPERVISOR I,A( KMANX â The
main benefit to be derived from the
passage of the ordinance will be
the closing up of the pool rooms.
The law is so general that it closes
down the bookmakers at the track
and does away with the side-street
evils in our city. I am glad that
their influence has been eliminated
by the adoption of the law, and I
only hope that the governing bodies
across the bay will follow our ex
ample and stamp out the pest. . V
As It is, those 'who are inilona to
bet their money on the races will of
necessity be compelled to go either
to Emeryville. Oakland or Sansallto.
As this will make it more difficult
than heretofore, it is hoped the
temptation to gamble will be les
sened.
50 far as the constitutionality of
the law is concerned, it is my opin
ion that this board has power to
regulate such things.
I am pleased that my fellow mem
bers voted, as I did, as the best citi
zens of the community .demanded
the passage of- the law. I am not In
favor of any action that will tend
to nullify the ordinance. Racing un
der Ms present conditions is injur
ious to our city. It is a good sport
if pool selling is eliminated, but
nnttl that Is done I don't . believe
the gamblers should be allowed to
continue in the business.
SUPERVISOR BYIXGTOXâ I voted
in favor of the resolution because
great abuses have grown up under
the pool selling system as it existed
at the race track, and because it
was a reform called for and de
manded by the best citizens of . the
community. Ah a Supervisor I was
elected to respect the â wishes of
those who have the_ welfare of the
city at heart. Personally 1 do not
believe in the existence of the
temptations held out by gambling
which draw our men and women
away from the pursuit of an honest
business calling.
I believe tills resolution was
passed in good faith and that the
Board of Supervisors should not be
continually open to an influence
that will cause a suspension of the
ordinance 'whenever those control
ling the race track wish it done. If
that 'were the intention of the board
It was an entirely useless procedure
to adopt the measure. â¢
" I think the passage of the ordi
nance-will have a good influence
upon the young men of our city. In
my opinion there was no -greater
danger ' held out to a community
than the temptation of squandering
the resources of an honest liveli
hood at the- race track.
1 SUPERVISOR AIGEI/TIXGER â I
voted In favor of the passage 'of the
ordinance because I thought .racing
had been overdone In 'this town, and
that our commercial interests had
greatly suffered on account of the
prolonged meetings. I believe in
treating the race track people fair
ly, but I think they have been* un
wise in holding such long meetings.
In the Eastern cities ' they - are re
stricted to a certain number* of
weeks, and I cannot understand
why San Francisco does not do like
wise.
SUPERVISOR HOLLAND I think I
am strongly on record regarding
mj- position in thin matter. It is the
gross* abuses that have developed in
the racing game to which I have
taken exception. - I would like to
Â»cc the Legislature legalize one
great race day, or a. week of racing,
nt which California-bred homed
could be ween in competition.. If
people could nee ' a race like the
English Derby or the Grand Prix of
France they would not want to sec
- the sport abolished entirely. This
is the only concession I would muke
to the men of the race course.
SUPER VISOR/ ARTHUR ATTRIDGE
- â I voted for the resolution because
I considered it the only means of
staying the progress of an evil
which has nlready worked its Minis
ter effects in society. For a time I
have watched^ the methods of the
racing men and the pursuits of
gambling, and came to the conclu
sion that instead of the evil show
ing signs of abatement it has passed
the limit of moral endurance. Hence
I considered but one thing proper
in the premises, and I cast my vote
to call a halt In the sport of horse
racing.
I certainly am in favor of tenting j
speed and quality of horseflesh on
the turf. California has a magnifi
cent future in that respect, and 1
would not' for a moment entertain
n thought of abolishing horse rac
ing, but the gambling attending it
has become too prevalent And has
wrought too much ruin. Hy the
adoption of the ordinance we have
placed ourselves as dominant over
the racing men. We do not intend
to deprive them of all privileges,
and may yet grunt to them certain
concesisons. What those concessions
will be I am not yet in a position to
state, but the limitation of the
period of racing may be one of
them. During such meets we may
permit betting, but we will place
certain restrictions upon it and
modify its demoralizing effects.
SI PERVISOR COLLIXS â I cast my
vote, in favor of the resolution pro
hibiting; betting or pool selling on
horse races within thin city and
county for the reason that I llrinly
believed that the people demanded
that heroic measures should be re
sorted to in order to check the evil.
I have always felt that race track
gambling has been carried too far.
I voted in favor of passing the reso
lution to print, and, realising the
evil behind bookmaking and pool
selling as it is carried on to-day, no
power on earth could make me
change my vote. To be frank, how
ever, I must say that I believe that
the resolution was n bit too sweep
ing in its effect. It would have been
better, perhaps, to place rigid re
strictions on the race track people,
instead of revoking their privileges
altogether. However, I believe that
the ordinance will have a good
effect.
SUPERVISOR HEYER â I am ex
tremely pleased that the resolution
prohibiting race track gambling
was favored by so many members of
the board. When the matter was
first mentioned I placed myself on
record as being in favor of it. There
w*s little doubt In my mind that the
Ingleside people carried their
schemes too far. Women and young
girls were gradually being demor
alized by the temptation of the
track. The phantom inducements of
the race track discouraged many a
man and woman from honest toil.
The vote the resolution received
to-day is certainly a great victory
for public-spirited people. I was
sick enough to stay at home to-day,
but I felt that I should attend here
to cast my vote in such a good
cause.
SUPERVISOR KALBEX â My posi
tion on this matter is much more
delicate than any other man on the
board, therefore I want you to treat [
me as kindly as possible. I am in j
the liquor business, and am brought .
in contact with racing people every |
day. My enstomers, too, exerted !
every effort to have me vote against
the resolution. I did not want to do
either, so I decided not to tote at
all on the proposition.
SI PERVISOR DEASY â I rejoice at
the victory we have won over the ;
gnmblers. This ordinance which I
we have succeeded in adopting will
greatly benefit onr city. It will be
n benefit both from a moral and
business standpoint. These gam
blers take more money away from a
town than they leave in It. I voted
for the resolution simply because I
believed that the loose methods of
the race track people were demor
alizing onr young people. Young
boys were succumbing daily to the
temptations of the race track. It has
been a powerful agency in making
criminals. \ow that gambling has
been prohibited entirely, 'I trust
that the board will see nt to keep it
in check forever.
â¢St PERVISOR BLACK â I voted
against IÂ»r. Perranlt's resolution
simply because I was convinced that
it was too sweeping in its effect.
Had a resolution been Introduced
restricting or limiting the racing
season I would probably have sup
ported it. The race track people
bave certain rights which can not
be ignored.
THE POLICE WILL ACT.
Chief Lees Declares That He Will
Enforce the New Ordinance
To-Day.
"I will enforce the ordinance pro
hibiting gambling on horse races at
Ingleside track, which was passed
yesterday afternoon by the Board of
Supervisors, to the full limit of the
law," said Chief Lees when seen, last
night. "When a new ordinance is
passed by the board it is customary
to notify me immediately after it is
signed by the Mayor. I presume !
the clerk of the board will serve me !
with a copy of the ordinance to-mor
row morning. I will then proceed
instantly to see that every provision
of the new law is carried out. Any
bookmaker who attempts to disobey
the ordinance will be arrested imme
diately. If the Mayor has already
signed the ordinance, and I under
stand that he has, I will make it my j
business to see that the law is not |
violated at the track to-morrow after
noon."
HE SEEKS TIME TO THINK.
Androus Threatens That Ingleside
Will Be To-Day as It Was
Yesterday.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 13.â Ex-State Senator
Androus, president of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club, was seen at his hotel in
this city this evening and told of Chief
Lees' declaration that he would place
under arrest any one who to-morrow
should make a book or sell pools at In
gleside track or other resort in San
Francisco. He was asked what action
he as president of the association would
â¢take in the matter.
He replied: "This has all come about
jso suddenly that we have made no
â  plans; we have had no time exactly to
I figure our position. In fact, I Have
! come up here to think-
"We did not expect the action taken

but thought we would get at least one
layover. A man accused of murder
isn't arrested, tried and hanged all In a
day, is he? He gets a layover, doesn't
he?"
The Call representative made no re
mark upon the gentle art of murder as
compared by Senator Androus with the
more profitable business he is engaged
In, but permitted him to continue.
"It is more than probable that Ingie
side will be running to-morrow and
that the bookmaking will 'go right on
as it has although I say positively that
i we intend to comply with the law, even
I If we must eventually close Ingleside to
do so', but you can say I think without
fear of contradiction that Ingleside will
be to-morrow as it v.as yesterday and
to-day. We have yet had time neither
. to plan nor think. This has come sooner
| than we had figured."
Just what brings Senator Androus
to Sacramento is raising some little
question here among the touts of the
: Oakland layout. That he has come up
: lure "to think" may be true, but the
insinuation is rife that it is "to think
up" some scheme for State relief at the
j hands of the present Legislature, late
! as it Is even to contemplate such ac
| tion.
A State law legalizing Ingleside's
chief incentive to suicide and embez
zlement would absolutely nullify this
morning's action of the Board of Su-
I pervisors, and the tip has gone out that
Androus has this in prospect. His pres
ence on the floor of both, the Assembly
and Senate and his close consultations
with numerous prominent legislators
! would indicate at least that a dark
brown think is not all that has brought
him up here to the capital.
WHAT THE TOILEES SAY.
Trades Union Men as a Unit Indorse
the Action of Supervisors.
It is safe to- say that no class of
people is more highly elated at the vic
tory over the gamblers of Ingleside
than the workingmen of this city.
The quarterly high jinks of Carpen
ters' Union Xo. 483 brought a large
number of laboring men together/ and
the racetrack question was the general
subject of the side conversation. It
was not regularly brought up. It could
not be at a gathering where dull care
was to be thrown aside and merriment
to hold sway, but, like the imp in the
bottle, it could not be kept down.
There was no two opinions on the
subject. All were glad that the bill had
passed. Every place In the city where
a group of laboring men could be found
together the action of the Supervisors
was commented upon and commended.
At the hall of the Labor Bureau Asso
ciation it was the one topic of conver
sation around the chess boards, at the
cigar counter and the billiard tables.
Every word uttered was a word of
praise for the men who were not afraid
of the combined gamblers and honestly
stood up for the good of the community
in the face of the open threats set afloat
by the racetrack men.
In other places where union men, and
men who work hard for their daily
bread, congregate nightly, the same
state of affairs was noticeable. Numer
ous tales of the track were told â here a
friend had fallen, there the tale of a
disgraced public official was recounted
and occasionally direct personal expe
riences and family skeletons were
trotted out to public view.
The workingmen, however, as a class,
have for once taken a firm stand
against altogether outside "trade rules"
| and "routine business." They were on
the winning side and they are proud
of it.

AMONG the many men who follow athletic sports as a means of gaining
a livelihood the young and agile "Kid" McCoy is the most admired
of any boxer, wrestler, runner or ball player who hag visited this city
since sport of any kind was inaugurated.
The quiet and unassuming pugilist who, by his lightning movements in
the ring and ability to administer heavy punishment to an opponent, has
won fame all through this country, is now domiciled at Henry L,eonhar<lt'B
emporium of sport commonly known as the Casino, in Golden Gate Park.
Leonhardt is a great admirer of his charge, who, he contends, was "correctly
named 'Kid' because of his retiring and gentlemanly disposition."
McCoy is visited daily by hundreds of admirers, although it will be some
weeks before he will have to give an account of himeelf when he toes the
scratch with his formidable opponent, Joe Choynski. Those who have seen
McCoy punch the bag at the Casino say that it is worth an admission fee to
any one who has a fancy for the sport.

IS RACING A GAME OF
CHANCE OR SCIENCE?
A Knotty Problem That the Hill Tribe
of Sausalito May Force the Su
preme Court to Solve.
Is poolselling a banknigr or a percentage game?
In other words, is horse racing a game of chance or a game of science?
That is the proposition the poolsellers who want to do business in
Sausalito will have to go up against in the near future, and it can readily
be seen that they are going to have an exceedingly unhappy time of it.
The status of horse racing is to be decided first by Superior Judge An
gellottl. and finally, in all probability, by the Supreme Court. If the bookies
undertake to prove the sport a game of chance it Js all off with them right
at the start under the present laws against gambling; if they make the stand
that it is purely a game of science It will be a frank admission from in
siders that the Corrigan methods are the scientific points of the sport; that
superior speed has nothing to do with winning races, but it all depends on
the jockeys and Jockeying.
With this admission on their part it would seem reasonable to expect
that their patrons might fall away to insignificant numbers, knowing that
the "science" was all on the other side, and in consequence the game would
languish in the English colony across the bay.
But that is just what the Sausalitansâ or that part known as the Hill
tribeâ want. Poolselling, and the sporting fraternity generally, are unwel
come visitors there and they are determined to bar them out altogether.
The Hillites thought the Legislature would do something, but when their
Senator, General Dickinson, was stricken with tongue paralysis or some
thing else at a critical stage, and the bill that would have emancipated
them, had it become a law, was lost, they gave up hope from that source
and sought refuge in the courts.
The Buffalo Hotel, owned by Charles Forrest, seems to be the greatest
source of disquietude to the Hill tribe, and some weeks ago H. H. Noble,
who owns property in the immediate vicinity, filed a bill in equity, through
his attorneys, Brunell & Treat, alleging, first, that the hotel was conducted
as a common gaming house; second, that a lottery was conducted there in
poolselling, and third, that a banking and percentage game was operated
there. Judge Angellotti sustined tho demurrer on the ground that there
were not enough facts to institute the action, as they did not show that
Noble's property was specifically injured, although the demurrer admitted
all the allegations.
Yesterday an amended complaint was filed, alleging, in addition to the
first named offenses, that the Buffalo Hotel is a disorderly house in the
meaning of the law, and a menace to the peace and comfort . of the Hill
tribe. Moreover, it alleges that it is impossible to sell or rent property in
the vicinity owing to the character of the house. In support of this it is
cited that three lots belonging to the estate of the late Julia Mills have been
in the market for some time, but it is utterly impossible to sell them- for the
reason given. Further, Mr. Noble alleges that the banks refuse to loan
money on his property, and he cannot find a tenant or purchaser for it,
because of the same reason.
The case will be fought to the bitter end on the part of the property
owners at least, and if they are defeated in the lower court they will carry
the case to the Supreme Court. That tribunal has never passed upon the
status of poolselling as a sport or gambling proposition, and a decision
from it will be awaited with interest.
Marble Company are still out, but it Is
the intention of the union to fight this
concern rather, than attempt to make
peace with ' it. The Vermont Marble
Company is a foreign concern. Its chief
office is in Vermont, and Senator Proctor
is its ruling spirit. It takes - contracts
in this city, but will have the actual work
dqne either here or In the Green Moun
tain State. For this reason the mem
bers of the union are determined to fight
it. A prominent member said last night:
"We have come to a satisfactory agree
ment with Ruffino & Bianchi, a purely
local concern, but we have no use for
the Vermont Marble Company. We â will
fight like the Greeks of old and our fight
will be to have all local marble work kept
within the State. If we succeed it will
be the finish of the foreign company. A
number of plumbers, who have been In
the habit of giving out their marble work
indiscriminately, have . been . interviewed
on the subject, and when the matter was
fairly presented to them they agreed to
piv-e. their work only to local concerns.
We have succeeded in the past in keep
ing many large contracts at home ; and I
think we can do so in the future. ' ...

MISCARBIAGE OF JUSTICE.
Criminal Escapes Because of Dilatory
Methods of Federal Officials.
There was a lamentable miscarriage of
justice yesterday morning in the United
States District Court, when Judge de
Haven ordered the indictment brought
against W. H. M. Ogg dismissed and the
prisoner discharged because the principal
witness for the prosecution had not been
subpenaed and had left the city the even
ing before.
Ogg was a resident of Sacramento and
was indicted on compjaint of Superinten
dent Thrall of the Railway Mail Service
and charged with using the mails for the
transportation of immoral matter in the
shape of drugs. Last Monday the sub
penas for the defendant were placed in
the hands of the United States Marshal
for service. A Deputy Marshal served the
subpenas in Sacramento and El Dorado
counties, but he neglected to serve one on
Superintendent Thrall, the most vital wit
ness on the part of the Government.
Tnraii's office is less than 100 yards rrom
the office of the United States Marshal,
and the,deputy took it for granted that he
fcould be served at any time. The delay
was fatal, for last Sunday night Mr.
Thrall left for "Washington in obedience
to a dispatch from the Postmaster Gen
eral, ana when the subpena was taken to
his office yesterday morning, of course he
could not be found.
As it was conceded that a conviction
was Impossible without Mr. Thrall's evi
dence, Judge de Haven threw the case out
of court.

BURNS STILL CRIES
FOR A CAUCUS
Another Effort Made to Line Up
the Republicans.
f CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, March 13.â Dan Burns is
â¢ still trying to get a caucus. His lieutenants and all of his .supporters
| among the legislators worked to this end with all their might and main
â¢ to-day and to-night, but when they reported progress to their chief late
to-night it was found that two-thirds of the Republican members of the
â¢ Legislature would have nothing to do with the scheme. Even some of
Burns' own men shied at the proposition. Among these was Senator
T Hoey, who refused to sign this latest invitation to legislators to cast
a conscience and duty to the winds and elect Burns Senator.
â  I To add to his other woes Burns finds himself face to face with a
â¢ proposition to adjourn the Legislature next Saturday. Knowing the
| emptiness of the boasts that have been made by his lieutenants that he
â¢ will be elected this week, Burns issued orders this morning that the
proposition to adjourn on Saturday should be defeated at all hazards.
â¢ The joint resolution flying final adjournment at the date named having
already passed the Assembly it was in the Senate that his faithful fol
â¢ lowers sought to execute the orders of the Mexican. So little success
attended their efforts, however, that when a motion was made to post-
T pone consideration of the joint resolution until Friday it was voted down
1 by an overwhelming majority. Taken by-and-large the day was a par-
I ticularly bad one for the Candelaria candidate.
â¢ Burns' latest caucus scheme is of a kind in keeping with his other
7 political methods. Though it fared badly It is still interesting as an
â¢ illustration of what a man will do who is grasping at straws. His
chief supporters in the Legislature were rounded up last night and
T given instructions to select from among the followers of other candi
dates such men as they were most intimate with and who would be
â¢ most likely to listen to the voice of the tempter. To these the proposi
k tion was to be made that each sign a separate call for a caucus, the
T fact of his having signed such a call to be kept secret until a total of
â¢ sixty names should have been secured, then all should be made public
I at the same time and the caucus held. In this way no one of those who
â¢ signed the call would know that another had signed it until a total of
sixty signatures were obtained.
â¢ It was a clever scheme and all that was lacking to make it a suc
cess was the necessary signatures. It was just here that the rub came.
â¢ One after another the followers of Grant, Barnes and Scott were ap
proached and taken aside into dark corners where the proposition was
â¢ broached to them in whispers and with a great show of secrecy, but
all to no effect. Some laughed, others gave utterance to words more
I forcible than elegant and all refused to sign. The intent of the scheme
a was too palpable.
I Having again failed in his attempt to get a caucus, and with the ad
â¢ journment resolution coming up to-morrow morning for final action, it
I seems more than probable that the Mexican will have to remain in the
â¢ open and take his defeat with as good grace as possible.

It was for the purpose of devisihg ways

Among tho attaches are a number of
Btanch Republicans, who have grown ven

There are also a large number, in fact a
majority, of youthful prodigies who style
themselves the young legislators of 1599
and serve the Senate in the capacity of
pages and messengers.
At the hour that the meeting convened
the young legislators promptly signified
their ability to conduct bodies of the
character by nominating and electing a
chairman and other officers necessary.
They were in the majority and the older
head that dared to interfere with their
mode of procedure was Immediately made
to realize the import of " a point of or

that the youthful legislators could mus

The "point of order was invariably
well taken and the seniors of the meet
ing had no use for an appeal from the
decision of the chair. Reluctant acquies
cence to the rulings of the chair was the
rule until the youngsters proceeded to
appoint a soliciting committee. A colored
gentleman who is a favorite of the boyfl
was made chairman of the committee,
and there was then open revolt and a
wholesale leave-taking on the part of the
minority. The boys are still in possession

GRANT MEN WANT
TO POSTPONE FINAL
ADJOURNMENT
Burns Forces Will Join in the
Move to Hold Off the
Fatal Day.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 13.â Just before this
evening's session of the Legislature the
Grant men got together to discuss ad
journment. The Assembly concurreni
resolution providing for an adjourn
ment had gone over to the Senate and
had been made a special order for to
morrow morning by a vote that bad<
fair to carry it through any time ii
came up, and the Grant men were nol
witting to tie themselves down.
For some time informal talks be
tween Grant men and Burns men or
the subject of an adjournment have
been indulged in, and the caucus this
evening was the result of a feeling
that Grant might not be much bene
fited if his men bound themselves tc
an adjournment next Saturday night.
The Burns men are anxious to hold on,
for another week, and the Grant mer
are willing to go as far as Wednesda>
and until the following Saturday ii
events warranted. It was decided bj
the conference, therefore, to have the
Grant Senators when the concurreni
resolution came up move to postpone
consideration until Friday morning.
The Grant Senators made their dea 1
in the Senate and finally compromised
by agreeing to let the consideration 01
the resolution go over until Thursday
morning. This will be done when the
resolution comes up to-morrow unless
intervening events demand a different
course.
While together the Grant men talked
over the latest straw at which the
drowning Burns forces are so eagerly
clutchjng. It appeared that nearly
every Grant man had been approached
by the Burns touts who were handling
his petition for a caucus and not one
of them had signed It. The only signa
tures the Grant men had seen upon the
petitions which had gone the rounds
were those of Burns men, aÂ»id one of
them, Burnett. Senator from San Fran
cisco, had withdrawn his name within
an hour after he had signed.
TROUBLE AHEAD FOR
COUNTY GOVERNMENT BILL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 13.â 1t looks dark ahead
for the unfortunate measure known as
the county government bill. It came up
like Banquo's ghost twice to-dayâ once
this morning, when it was put over til!
this evening, and again this evening,
when it was put over again till to-mor
morrow morning. This evening there was
no talk over the bill and it was quietly
slipped on to another day without causing
a ripple on the legislative pond. But
this morning it was different. The bill
was a special order for this morning, and
when it came up for consideration there
were several Senators waiting for it with
heavy hammers.
Morehouse raised the trouble by moving
that the bill be made a special order for
8 o'clock this evening. This brought
Dwyer to his feet with the suggestion
that then was as good a time as any to
kill the bill and he objected to have it go
any longer without the serious and prob
ably fatal consideration of the Senate.
Dickinson suggested that it was late' in
the session and nobody wanted the coun
ty government act anyhow, and hi
thought the best thing that could hap
pen to it would be to allow it to die on the
file for unfinished business. He said he
did net want it to stand in the way of
the general appropriation bill, which will
soon make its debut in the Senate, and
any way there was no use wasting time
Morehouse was the only one to
defend the measure. It is a child oX thÂ«
Joint Committee on County Government

wanted the Senate to postpone action on

many Senators whose bills on county
matter? had been embodied in the county
government act and would be. carried
down in its fall. He said he would he

CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA-.
MENTO, March 13.â Burns to-night is]
familiar with the sensations of a de- ]
feated candidate for the United States
Senate.
The defeats on the pool bill and the ,
Harbor Commission reorganization
scheme were severe, but the crushing
disaster came when the Supervisors of
San Francisco swept the gambling
fraternity from the field at Ingleside.
. Burns derived his chief support as a
â  candidate from expectation of places ,
on the water front under the reor
granization of the Harbor Commission
.and from the gambling influences of
â  Ban Francisco, whose greatest gains
. came from the Ingleside racecourse.
Burns and every tout in the corral now
comprehend the force of public judg
ment. The rebuke administered to the
gamblers and the touts of Ingleside in
â  San Francisco was likewise a rebuke
to the followers of Burns in Sacra
mento. All touts look alike to the peo- j
pie, and it makes little difference |
â whether they are seen on the racetrack
or about the State Capitol.
Early this morning before the news
of the Ingleside disaster had reached
Sacramento Burns attempted to revive
the scheme to bring about a caucus.
Faithful adherents to the cause of the
"Colonel" were placed on duty in the
Senate and Assembly to circulate the
petition for signatures. Senator Leavitt
encountered a frost in the Senate cor
ral. One of the Senators who has
been voting for Burns since the first
ballot was cast flatly refused to sign
. the petition. It is reported to-night
that one of the signers has determined
to withdraw his name from the paper. |
Outside of the corral not a signature
indorsing the scheme could be obtained.
There was a cold reception in the As
sembly. Dibble and Johnson, who were
relied upon to give the proposition the
warmest kind of support, appeared 10
be wholly indifferent to the success of
the scheme. When the news reav .
the Capitol that the gambling- frater
nity had been overthrown In San Fran- i
cisco by a great wave of moral remon- !
strance little interest was taken in the ,
. last effort to brace up the fortunes of
Burns.
The unexpected happened in the joint
assembly to-day. Senator Currier of
Los Angeles voted for U. S. Grant.
â  Three weeks ago the Senator obtained
leave of absence on account of sickness,
and while he was sojourning in his
southern home the Bulla men, with
whom he had been voting, cast their
fortunes with General Barnes and Irv
ing M. Scott. It was supposed that Sen
ator Currier on his return would vote
for one or the other of these Senatorial
candidates, and the prediction was
made by his friends that he would vote
for General Barnes. Surprise was there
fore manifested to-day when the Sen
ator voted for the San Diego states
man. The Grant men were highly
elated over the accession, as it was the
first gain achieved by their forces since
the contest began. The joy in the Grant
household was heightened by the return
of Milton J. Green to the scenes of Sen
atorial activity. The charges of con
tempt against Green have been dis
missed so far as the Assembly is con
cerned, and therefore he returns to the
fray as good as new and twice as cau
tious as he was before the investigation
began.
To-night the Grant men are more
. confident of success in the fight than
they have ever been. The depression in
the Burns camp cannot be concealed.
The proverbial dislike of the devil to
holy water is nothing compared to the
dislike which the touts entertain for
Grant and his men. When Senator Cur
rier went to the Grant camp the fol
; lowers of Burns were grieved as well as
surprised.
The danger of Grant's election may
; cause most serious consideration of the I
â  proposition for Burns to withdraw from
the struggle. Several of the "Colonel's"
|J friends believe that he should retire, as
: the seal of public judgment has been
firmly set against his election. He can
; not hope to win, they say, and his fur
ther presence in the contest increases
the chance of Grant capturing the prize.
The Legislature may adjourn sine die
next Saturday night and it may not.
To-night the sentiment seems to be
that a candidate who can win at all
can win this week.
Since the splash of water on Grant's
wheel it is said that his men are in
clined to resist the resolution to ad
journ sine die next Saturday evening.
There will be a mix-up of the forces of
the respective candidates this week.
Irving M.Scott is here and hopes to gain
when the break comes from one of the
â  leaders. The supporters of Burns en
courage him to keep in the field and
await results. The Colonel is counting
on the remote possibility of receiving
some support from the Scott forces al
though Senator Davis is not among the
â¢expected The Colonel's chief fear is
- that the Scott men will go in a block
to General Barnes or Grant. This ap
prehension prompts him to use his
cleverest efforts to keep the Scott forces
â¢ The reappearance of Milton Green ex
cites a deal of wrathful comment in
legislative circles. Several members
who voted to dismiss the contempt pro
. feedings in the Assembly have sent out
requests that they be publicly kicked
( for bo voting. .".-",â ,
There was a round up of the Grant
forces to-night to consider the subject
of sine die adjournment. It was de
cided as the sense of the conference
thai action on the Belshaw concurrent
â¢ resolution to adjourn next Saturday
night should be deferred until next Fri-
Burns, in a desperate effort to rulo
â¢ or ruin, is now casting about for means
"â¢ to induce fearless members of the
. Legislature who cannot be brought into
his camp to pro home and remain there.
â¢.He desires the weak and pliable to re
â¢ â¢ main here to do his bidding when op
portunity is presented to advance his
. â  .candidacy.
"â¢â¢ Every man opposed to Burns who de
' Berts his post of duty at this time Bim
. ply gives the Mexican an advantage of
....a. half vote. The number required to 1
elect a Senator will diminish as the
whole number of votes decreases. The
men of this Legislature who hold that
the honor of the State should be pre
served at any sacrifice express the
earnest desire to-night that every man
opposed to the election of an unworthy
and unfit aspirant for the Senatorship
should remain at his station of duty
until the body adjourns sine die.
It is believed that the good and true
men of the Legislature, who have made
a noble tight from the beginning of the
contest until this time to save the
State from the disgrace and humilia
tion of Burns' election, will not now at
the eleventh hour be deceived or ca
joled into a scheme to abandon the
cause of the people. It is quite well
understood that members who have
business interests at home requiring
personal attention are anxious to look
after th*-ir neglected affairs, but a
sacrifice in this regard may be demand
ed for the public good. It matters little
to the touts whether they are at home
or elsewhere. Few of them have in
terests to subserve outside of political
manipulations, and for all they care
they would as soon be in Sacramento
as anywhere else. Every good and re
sponsible representative who absents
himself from his post of duty at this
time places in the hands of the irre
sponsible a weapon to be used against
the people of California.
The plan of Burns and the railroad is
to wear out and exhaust the patience
of members, hoping that the attend
ance will become so slight that touts
can muster a sufficient number to
elect the candidate of their choice.
Members of the Legislature who are
animated by a high sense of obligation
to maintain the honor and dignity of
California will remain here until the
session is ended.
A message was received at the Grant
camp to-night from Senator Cutter,
who is sick in Marysville, in which it is
stated that the Senator will be in his
place in the Senate to-morrow.

appointment of a Board of Commission- :
ers "who shall be experienced in the !
workings of expositions." Morehouse j
paused in his vote to ask if that provision >
was still in the bill, and on being in- \
formed that it was, he voted "no." There
were several who. after having voted in
favor of the bill, found that they did not
like it in the form in which it passed,
therefore there were signs of approval
when Nutt Rave notice of a motion to re- i
consider. The vote was 24 to 4.
Miller's Assembly bill No. 440. providing
for the granting to railroad corporations ,
of franchises for wharves and piers for |
terminal purposes, without first offering i
the same for sale, came up. but was laid I
over for amendment after Boyce had de- i
nour.ced it as dangerous. The amend- ;
ments made were to the enacting clause, ,
which was not drawn in proper form.
The Senate concurred in the Assembly ;
amendment to Braunhart's fender bill, i
The bill provides for the use of proper |
fenders and brakes on all street ears. |
The amendment made compliance with
any local ordinance on the subject a sat- ,
isfaction of the provisions of the pill. ;
The amendment affects San Francisco >
principally, where there is already an j
ordinance' regarding fenders, but there IB
no ordinance regarding brakes so the bill j
will have some effect in San Francisco.
Stratton's Senate bill 325, appropriating '
jw km for the erection of buildings and
making certain improvements for the
State university brought opposition from ;
all sides. 15ulla objected to so large
an appropriation. Smith declared that
the university had not been able to tell
the Finance Committee what it would do \
with the $80,000 already at Its disposal for I
this year. There were others who spoke j
in the same strain and then the hour for \
the joint assembly saved the bill from
being killed. This evening the bill was
put over until to-morrow on Senator
Stratton's explanation that it had been j
decided to amend the bill by cutting in

Senator Shortridge has been placed in |
the unfortunate position of passing a bill
which he intended to vote against. It i
was Senate bill 367. a measure introduced j
I . Si nator Rowell, which makes bank ;
deposits taxable to the banks, and it j
passed by just the necessary twenty-one j
votes. Shortridge's vote was the twenty
first.
This afternoon Shortridge moved to re
consider the vote by which the bill had
passed, but the Senate refused to con
sider. Then the Senator rose to a ques- |
tlon of personal privilege. He explained !
that as the vote progressed he saw the ;
bill would pass, or thought he did, and so
before the vote was announced he j
changed his vote from "no" to "aye."
This was a fatal move, and Shortrldge
saw too late that by changing his vote he
had passed tho bill.
Assembly bill 37, which was defeated |
Saturday, was taken up for reconsldera- i
tion on motion of Stratton. The bill Is j
one to allow the Pullman company to keep j
a lien on its cars until they have been
fully paid for in order to protect them
from the action of any mortgage that may
be upon the road purchasing- them. The
liill was reconsidered and passed by a
vote of 22 to 7.
Senator Morehouse brought up Bur
nett's Senate bill 450 for reconsideration,
but the Senate refused to reconsider. Bur
nett's bill provides for the making of a
report to the Bank Commissioners by the
banks at the same time as the annual
statement is made to the Assessor.
Under an urgency resolution introduced
by Rowell Stratton's Senate bill 319 was
brought up. The measure is one to al
low the State University to insure certain
property it holds in S?.n Francisco. Short
ridge opposed the bill because he thought
the State should insure its own property.
Rowell called attention to the fact that
the bill allowed the insurance of income
paying property only. The bill passed by
;i vote of 24 to fi after being read the sec
ond and third times.
EXPOSITION BILL
PASSES THE ASSEMBLY
CAL.L HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 13.â The Assembly passed
the exposition bill this morning by a vote
of 49 to 9. but the small force of the op
position does not indicate that there was
no fight made to beat the measure out.
On the contrary, the fight was as char
acteristically bitter as any Grove John
son is able to make. The Sacramentan
made his usual sneering attack, but found
only a few of the country members to
stand with him, and they all argued sole
iv from a oasts or nard times.
' Wade of Napa said this was no year
to spend $900,000 or any part of that
amount on a celebration. There had been
no rain and there was no promise of any
and the Legislature had better give its
time and vote to reducing the tax levy.
Rrbinson of Nevada County said about
the same thing- and so did Judge Clough
of Plumas. Clough said there was noth

SHEEP CAUSE A ROW
IN THE ASSEMBLY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March 13.â old fight be
tween the sheep men of the valleys and
the range owners of the mountains broke
out afresh in the Assembly chamber this
afternoon and for half an hour hard
words were bandied back and forth by
the representatives of the two factions.
Valentine. Huber, Melick and Mack mixed
things in royal shape, and in the turmoil
the Committee on County and Township j
Government was accused of doing some
I One work with Assembly bill 289.
Assembly bill 259 is one of the half thou- |
i sand county government bills which have
been introduced. It lays down the duties
! and privileges of County Boards of Su
i pervisors and contains the following
! clause relative to the taxing of migrating
sheep herds:
To license, for purpose of regulation and
revenue, all and every kind of business not
prohibited by law and transacted and carried
on in such county, and all shows, exhibitions
: and lawful games carried on therein; to fix
the rates of license tax upon the same, and to
provide for the collection of the same by suit
or otherwise, but no license tax upon the busi
ness of raisin*, grazing, pasturing or herding
sheep shall exceed the sum of I cents per an
num per head, and no license tax shall be im
posed for or on count Kit unwtranwl lambs.
Under the present law there is no limit
placed upon the tax that Boards of Super
visors may put upon ranging sheep, and
In nearly every one of the mountain coun
ties there is a charge of 5 cents per head.
In April and May of each year, when
the fields in the valleys begin to curl up
and blow away, the. sheepmen take their
herds into the green, cool shades of the
mountains, where the feed is green near- I
ly all the year round.
The mountain dwellers claim that tht?
sheep not only cut their roads to pieces,
but also restrict the number of cattle
they may raise themselves, as it is a
well-known natural fact that not even a
ground hog will range after sheep.
Of a consequence the valley men and
their sheep are within the jurisdiction of
the mountain counties for from four to
nine months of each year, and all the
mountain counties get out of it is the tax
allowed them under the constitution. In
every Legislature convened in twenty
years past the sheepmen have attempted
to set a maximum of 2 or 3 cents upon the
tax Supervisors may impose. They at
tempted it again this year. Chair
man Huber, of the Committee on County
Government, offered a bill fixing the max
imum to 2 cents. Mr. Raub affixed an
other, but both the Senate and Assembly
committees struck the clause out of each
bill, leaving the law as it was, with no
limit. A committee substitute was of
feredâA. B. No. 1000â which did not re
fer to the tax in any way.
This afternoon, however, bill >o. 288
was suddenly reported back by Chairman
Huber with the recommendation that it
do pass, and investigation developed that
it carried the very clause that had been
twice stricken out by committee except
j that the maximum was raised from -
cents to 3 cents.
The report, which purported to be a
I majority recommendation, was signed by
only four of the thirteen members, and
those of the committee who had not
signed jumped to their feet and demanded
to know when the committee had met
and made any such recommendation.
Huber said that they had met this after
! noon and it transpired upon further
â  questioning that the only meeting held
! was held by the committee clerk, P. H.
I Tyler, who made up the report and then
i circulated it round the floor and got four
' members of the committee who were fav
i orable to the mutton end of the proposi
: tion to sign it.
Mack of Inyo condemned the action ot
: Huber and Tyler severely. He rehearsed
! the history of the bill since its introduc
i tion and demanded that it be recommitted
'' and every member of the committee
given a chance to sign a new report.
Judge Clough wanted it beat on the
! spot. In a red hot speech he said he
had been informed by a sheepman before
this Legislature convened that $30,000
had been raised by sheep owners to get
' the clause in question through in one or
I the other of the county government acts.
He said the bill was not square ana he
would fight it to a standstill.
Valentine of Los Angeles moved that
: the bill be taken up at once and placed
on the second reading file. He spoke in
I favor of the measure and put up the
I sheepmen's argument in its support.
Kenneally, who was against the meas
i ure, hunted up Clerk Tyler and accused
i him pointedly of having jockeyed the
! records and Assemblyman Mack also in
' formed the energetic clerk that crooked
work of the part he had been guilty of
would not be tolerated.
Dibble attempted to smooth things over
I and save tho measure from reeommit
i ment but a motion of Melick's and a de
mand by Mack that it be sent back to the
committee prevailed, and after dinner this
evening the thirteen members met to give
iit further consideration. As a result of
! the meeting a majority report, signed
i by eight members, was offered against
i the bill and a minority report, signed by
' three members, recommended its passage.
Now the fight has transferred Itself to the
i floor of the House. _

FINAL ADJOURNMENT
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 13.â The Assembly con
current resolution passed by the Assem
bly, and providing for an adjournment
sine die at midnight of Saturday next,
came before the Senate this afternoon and
caused a breeze.
Gillette wanted the resolution considered
at once, and moved that the rules be sus
pended and the resolution adopted with
out reference to the Committee on Rules,
the course it would take under ordinary
circumstances. There was some mistake
in the date of the resolution read, so it
was passed over for awhile to allow the
clerk of the Assembly to correct it. Then
when it fame up again half an hour later
Leavitt moved to refer it to the I'ummit
n Rules. Davis called for Gillette's

th isideration of the resolution a spe
cial onU-r t'"T to-morrow morning.
This broimht Hettman to his feet with
a substitute for the motion. He moved
that the resolution be taken up Friday
morning. This was put to a vote and

to consider the resolution Wednesday, but
he was declared out of order. In the 'in

L The Ut ÃuleÂ£ lf Co"mTnittee considered the

should go over until Thursday morning
on account of the uncertainty caused by

' bill not be ready by Saturday, it would
take another concurrent resolution to set
this one aside, and failing that, the Go\

It is the experience of the Senate that the

SAN LUIS BANKS
WILL PAY IN FULL
SAN LUIS OBISPO, March 13.â
depositor of the County Bank of
San Luis Obispo is In clanger of |
losing- one cent of the money ha j
intrusted to that institution. Such
was the declaration made to-night by
Secretary Dunsmoor of the Bank Com
mission after Commissioner Barrett
had concluded his examination of the
bank. There were present during the |
investigation, -which was in progress ]
all day at the bank, W. H. Spencer, P.
B. Prefumo, A. W. Steinhart and R. E.
Jack, directors of the institution, and
Nathan Goldtree. one of the largest
stockholders of the bank. W. L. Bee
bee, president of the bank, was too ill
to be present. All these stockholders
were examined under oath. As the re
sult of the examination the following
statement of the condition of the insti
tution was obtained:

General Barrett took charge of the
bank on behalf of the commission and
appointed Harry F. Osgood. the as
sistant cashier, to be the agent of the
Bank Commissioners until the court
shall have passed upon the solvency of
the institution.
Upon the return of General Barrett
to San Francisco he will meet his fel
low Commissioners and report to them.
If they support his findings they will
notify the Attorney General of the re
sult of the investigation; the latter will
bring suit against the bank on behalf
of the people, and the court will deter
mine whether the bank is solvent or
insolvent. If it is found to be insolvent,
the assets will be turned Â»ver to the
bank directors for liquidation. The di- i
rectors are allowed by law four years |
within which to wind up affairs, and i
during this time are still under the
supervision of the commission. ,
All the banks that are creditors of
the County Bank are San Francisco in- |
stitutions and the respective amounts
due them are largely secured. Not a
single country bank will suffer directly
from the suspension of the County
Bank.
Another strong factor in favor of the
depositors is the fact that about 22 per
cent of the amount due depositors is
comprised of sums deposited by stock
holder of the bank. Under the code
stockholders who are depositors can be
paid only after the demands of outside
depositors have been fully met.
In * the foregoing statement, which
Genera! Barrett will submit to the full
commission, the real estate assets
shown are based upon actual market
values of the properties to-day, and of
the bills receivable only such as are
either fully secured or bear the signa
tures or indorsements of men known to ;
be absolutely able to meet their obli
gations are given. In arriving at the
result mentioned the book assets were
scaled down to the extent of $150,000.
Of the bills receivable, between $165,000
and $170,000 are secured. It is con
fidently expected the assets, properly
handled, will easily realize more than
enough to pay all creditors, and possi
bly all the stockholders in full. But
even if the assets should fail to realize
enough to pay the creditors in full, the
stockholders are mostly men of ample
means, and the creditors can have re
course against them for the debts of
the bank, according to the shareholders'
proportion of stock. The full list of
stockholders and their respective hold
ings follows, the capital stock of the
bank being $150,000, divided into 1500
shares of $100 each:

Twelve deeds conveying property in
this county were filed here to-day as
a result of the suspension of the County
Bank of this city and of the Bank of
Paso Bobles of Paso Robles. Two uf
these were from F. D. Frost, cashier
and manager of the Bank of Paso
Hobies, to J. B. Earle, representing the
Anglo-Californian Bank of San Fran
cisco; two were from R. E. Jack, cash
ier of the County Bank, to J. B. Earle;
five were from the County Bank to the
Anglo-California Bank, and three were
from the County Bank to J. B. Earle.
These deeds were delivered to the
grantees about a year ago, indicating
that already at that time these institu
tions were making heroic efforts to
keep afloat. Y- -^ : :^i~ : V .
As was anticipated the Commercial
Bank failed to open for business to
day. After a meeting of its directors
a written notice, brief but pregnant
with significance, was posted on one of
the doors, reading: m
"Bank closed; will not open.
During the morning and part of the
afternoon small groups of people
gathered in front of the bank and
amused themselves gossiping about the
suspensions and gazing longingly at
the drawn blinds, which effectually
concealed what was transpiring behind
Every one took the situation philo
sophically, and while there were many
expressions of disappointment there
were few words of blame for the man
agers of the unfortunate bank. It is
believed this Institution will make as
good a showing as the County Bank,
as equally responsible people are con
nected with it. Its capital stock is
$200,000, divided into 2000 shares of $100
each. Its shareholders and their re
spective holdings are as follows:

When the Andrews Banking Com
' mnv opened its doors this morning
there was a small, eager-eyed group of
oeonle in front of the bank building,
waiting to withdraw money from the
hank They were promptly and fully
accommodated, and by 11 o'clock the
run had virtually ceased, after about
no 000 had been paid over the counter,
President J. P. Andrews remarked:

sioner Barrett will give his attention
to the Commercial Bank. He expects
to conclude his labor here during the
day, and has planned to leave for Paso
Robles on Wednesday morning to in
vestigate the Citizens' Bank, which
closed its doors to-day.
P. Kaetzel, manager of the Bank of
Cambria of Cambria, was in this city
to-day and said that he had ordered
his establishment to close on Saturday
owing to the suspension of the Com
mercial Bank, of which it was a branch.
County Bank of San Luis Obispo.
This suspension has little Importance
owing to the restricted amount of
business done by the Bank of Cambria.
CITIZENS' BANK SUSPENDS.
This Action Taken to Protect Itself
and Its Creditors.
PASO ROBLES, March 13.â The Citi
| zens' Bank, as The Call predicted,
closed its doors this morning. It posted
a notice stating that it would reopen in
a few days, as soon as the excitement
had subsided; but It is known it will
not reopen its doors until the Bank
Commissioners shall have examined
into its affairs. The notice was as fol
lows:
Noticeâ As a matter of self protection
and for the protection of our creditors
we have decided to close until the pre
vailing excitement has subsided.
By order of the Board of Directors,
A. F. HORSTMAN, Secretary.
In an interview Cashier Horstman
said:
"The Citizens' Bank was prepared to
carry all its customers through what
now looks like a dry year and to meet j
all demands. The suspension is due to I
the unusual demands on account of the ;
closing of the County Bank and the |
Bank of Paso Robles."
The Citizens' Bank is considered by
the public to be in a solvent condition,
and is expected to resume business in
the course of a few weeks.
The closing of the Bank of Paso
Robles and the Citizens' Bank, the only
two financial concerns in this city, has
had a demoralizing effect on business.
The city funds being tied up in these
banks the city is left without a cent
with which to pay its running ex
penses. It is reported that the City
Trustees at their next meeting will
consider the advisability of raising the
license on saloons from $25 to $100 a
quarter. There are rumors to the ef
fect that the city will have to disin
corporate until a more prosperous time
comes. If the banks resume business
within a few days, which is thought
probable by some, all the scare will
have blown over and business will pro
ceed in its usual way as though noth
ing had happened.
H. H. Meier, dealer in cigars and to
bacco made an assignment to the
Board of Trade. His liabilities are
about $600, assets nominal.
FAILURE AT TEMPLETON.
Local Bank Suspends in Order to
Avoid a Run Upon It.
TEMPLETON, March 13.â The Bank
of Templeton failed to open its doors
this morning. There was posted on its
doors a notice as follows:
Owing to the suspension of several
banks with which we are connected tlie
board of directors have decided to sus
pend business temporarily.
A. P. SEEMAN. Cashier.
The bank has always been in good
condition, but the prospects of two dry
years in this region and the collapse of
other banks in the county caused this
one to close. The officers of the bank
claim all depositors will be paid in full.
Cashier Seeman says the bank may re
npen in ten days, but he cannot say
positively. If the bank had opened its
doors this morning as usual there
would have been a run on it, as many
depositors came in from the country to
draw out their money. All were disap
pointed when they found the doors
closed.
The Bank of Templeton was organ
ized eleven years ago by William
Horstman and son and later was re
organized with a capital of $25,000. It
had done a good business until the past
two years. Officials claim between
$20,000 and $22,000 deposits and $46,000
in notes, real estate, etc. They say
every creditor will be paid in full. The
officers are: A. F. Horstman, presi
dent; J. Quarnstrom, vice-president;
A. P. Seeman, cashier; J. H. Glass and
H. Wesel, directors.
ONLY A LIGHT RUN.
Santa Maria Bank Meets All De

SANTA MARIA, March 13.â Owing to
its supposed connection with the San

made on the Commercial Bank here on
Saturday and this morning. The bank

RICHEST QUARTZ
SEEN IN SEATTLE
â  SEATTLE, March 13.â Considerable excitement has been caused here m
& by the receipt from Southeastern Alaska of some of the richest free mill- #
g ing gold quartz ever seen in Seattle. It is from the Sea Level mine on 2S
Â§J5 Thorn Arm, in the Ketchican district. News of the first big discoveries Â£
Q there was published in The Call last fall. Any of the specimens will ft
g average from $20,000 to $60,000 a ton. One piece is almost a solid nugget fa

Several of the owners of the Sea Level mine are residents of San JJ

SAN LUIS OBISPO, March 13.â }
j statement that the Commercial Bank ;
j branches in Santa Maria, Guadaloupe \
\ and Lompoc were closed Is a mistake.
'â â  They are open and doing business. The
j report of their closing was erroneous.
THE LAST STATEMENT.
Condition of the Paso Robles Bank on
December 31.
The Bank of Paso Robles is closely j
connected with the two San Luis Obis- J
po banks which closed their doors last j
week. This is because R. E. Jack, one
of the heavy stockholders of the for
mer, is a stockholder in the latter. Like
the banks at the county seat, the Paso
j Robles institution has acquired consid- j
I erable real estate which, owing to the ;
! lack of rain, has greatly depreciated in j
value. A gentleman recently from San
Luis Obispo says that within the past j
four years the several banks in the I
! county have come into possession of â 
I thousands of acres of farming and i
I grazing lands. In four years over 150
1 mortgages have been foreclosed and I
; lands sold to satisfy debts of from !
\ $5000 to $15,000. In nearly every in- j
! stance the banks bought in the proper- j
! ties.
"As the case stands now," said he,
"the banks own nearly the whole of the
county. On account of the dry year
they are unable to either sell or rent
their properties: so there they areâ
caught in a bad fix, land poor and with
not much ready cash. Their case is
by no means hopeless, for they have
plenty of property to secure depositors
as soon as the security shall have any
value."
According to the last statement from
the Bank of Paso Robles, made on De
cember 31, the bank is owned by R. E.
Jack, H. E. Eppinger and F. D. Frost,
who in the report sign themselves as
"proprietors." According to their
statement to the Bank Commissioners,
the bank owns land in San Luis Obispo
valued at $10,000, which according to the
books cost $7832 19. Cashier Frost's bal
ance sheet on the date mentioned
showed resources and liabilities as fol
lows:

Real estate taken for debt $ 7,832 19
Loans on real estate 33,308 73

LIST OF SECOND
LIEUTENANTS FOR
THE REGULAR ARMY
Additional Officers to the Number of 123, as
Provided For in the Reorganiza
tion Bill.
WASHINGTON, March 13.â 8y direc- i
tion of the President the following named
general officers are honorably discharged
from the volunteer army of the United
States, to take effect this year on the f
dates specified, their services being no ;
longer required:
Major General Joseph W. Kelfer. May 12. i
Brigadier Generalsâ Abraham K. Arnold,
May 12; Alexander C. M. Pennlngton, April 12;
Simon Snyder. May 12; George M. Randall,

May 1Â°
The officeâ¢ named will relieve their aids and
order them to Join their regiments. Brigadier
General McKibben will proceed to Columbus f
Barracks, Ohio, and assume command of that
post. The other officers exclusively of the
volunteer army will proceed to their homes, ;
while those of the permanent establishments
will Join their regiments.
It should be explained that the reduction in
the list of teneral officers made by to-day 8 j
order is not sufficient In itself to meet the de- ,
mands of the existing law. There must be a
further cut, in fact the list of major generals I
and brigadier generals remaining must be re
duced by ten altogether In order to bring the
list down to the nineteen permitted by the
strength of the regular army. In effecting tins â ,
reduction It is the intention to reduce some of
the major generals to the rank of brigadier
generals Instead of mustering them out of the
service. Also In the case of some of the brig
adier generals yet to be dropped. It will doubt
less be found that Instead of being mustered
out of the United States service entirely some
of the officers who held lower position In the
regular army will return to their former regi
mental and staff places. Ââ,ââ
The major generals who retain their volun
teer commissions at present are Wade, Shaf ter.
Otis, Wilson, Fitzhugh Lee. Wheeler. Bates.

It is not contemplated to make any more
changes in the volunteer, genera army and
staff officers at present. Under the law the
officers mustered out to-day could be re
tained until the proclamation of peace was Is
sued, but the President determined to muster
out all that could be spared. It was found
impossible to reduce the force in the pay de
partment, as the officers are all no * *"Â». I Â«Ef*

SANTA CRUZ HEROINES
IDENTIFY DICKMAN
Young Ladies Tell of the Pursuit
and Capture of the
Burglar.
SANTA CRUZ. March 13.â C. H. Dick
man, the burglar who was captured by
four young ladies of Santa Cruz, was
before Justice Stanley tnis morning for i
examination and was held to answor be
fore the Superior Court, with bail fixed
at $7f>o. The courtroom was crowded, but
spectators were disapoointed in not hear
ing Miss Mamie Mirandi, the heroine of
the capture, who was absent from the
city.
The first witness was Mrs. A. Jennings,
who testified she was absent from home
on the day of the robbery. During that
time her house was entered by way of
the front door. From all appearances the
lock was pried open with a chisel or othet
blunt instrument.
Miss Lizzie Mirandi, sister of the hero
ine, said she saw a man, whom she iden
tified as the prisoner, leave the Jennings
home. He was dressed as he now is.
but was clean chaven. He came out or
the front gate. She thought he had brok
en into the house and ought to be caught,
so she ran after him. He started to run
at the corner of Barson and Broadway.
She kept up with him. This was after
her sister had entered the Jennings dwell
ing and confronted the burglar.
Miss Hattie Fitzsimmons positively
identified the prisoi^r. She had seen him
walk along Campbell street before he en
tered the Jennings house. Later she saw
Miss Mirandi pursuing the man ami asked
her what was wrong. Miss Mirandi said
he was a burglar, so the witness joined
in the chase.
Miss Olive Twombly gave similar testi.
mony.
Charles Fitzsimmons identified the
prisoner as the man he captured.
Mrs. Mackay Is better.
NEW YORK, March 13.â Mrs. Clarence
Mackay, who Is suffering from an attack

ADDICKS BEATEN
FOR THE SENATE
Delaware's Legislature
Fails to Elect.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DOVER, Del.. March 13.â After one
of the most exciting scenes that has
ever been witnessed In the General As
sembly of this State, the session of 1899
ended at 3:06 o'clock this afternoon
without electing a United States Sen
ator to succeed Hon. George Gray. It
is the first time in the history of the
Senate that there is an unquestionable
Senatorial vacancy, and owing to the
precedent of the upper house of Con
gress in refusing to seat gubernatorial
appointees, after the Legislature of a
State has had opportunity to elect, the
seat of Mr. Gray will remain vacant
until the General Assembly of 1901
shall choose his successor. At the same
time the term of Senator Richard R.
Kenney will also expire, and it will
therefore devolve upon the next Legis
lature to elect two Senators.
The final ballot, the fourteenth of the
day and the one hundred and thirteenth
of the session, was as follows: John
Edward Addicks (Union Republican),
21; Colonel Henry A. Dupont (R.), 9;
John Biggs (D.), 6; ex-Congressman L.
Irving Sandy (D.), 6; ex-Senator
George Gray (D.), 4: Willard Sauls
bury (D.), 3; ex-Senator Anthony Hig
gins (R.), 2.
The time agreed upon for adjourn
ment sine die was 1 p. m., and when the
one hundred and thirteenth ballot was
completed it lacked eighteen minutes
of that hour by the House clock, which
was six minutes slow. The Democrats
tht-n adopted filibustering: tactics. The
filibustering was successful, and with
Mr. Rose on the floor, making an ad
dress on the disorder in the room and
on other pretended themes, the presid
ing officer brought down his gavel as
the clock pointed to the hour of 1.
The chamber was in an uproar in an
Instant, and it was some time before
quiet was restored. Democratic mem
bers and regular Republican members,
who are opposed to Addicks, cheered
loudly, many of the legislators jump
ing on their desks and weaving their
hats.
High 1 arm Assessments.
WOODLAND, March 13.â Farmers of
Tolo County, says Assessor Smith, are
demanding a reduction In their assess
ments. They claim â and with much show
of reason â that farming- land is assessed
higher than any other class of property.
EVERY DRUGGIST CAN GET HUDYAN.
[RHEUMATISM]
\ HUDYAN CURES. J
HUDYAN REMEDY COMPANYâ Dear Doctors: I feel that lan Â« flat*
bound to send you a testimonial of my gratitude for the cure that haÂ» been
effected in my case by your remedyâ Hudyan. I hope that other sufferers may
read this and be induced to follow my example and fling aside their prejudices
against advertised remedies. Roughly estimated. I have spent nearly fifteen
hundred times as much In being doctored most to death as I have in being
cured. I was for years a sufferer from chronic rheumatism. My joints were
stiff and I was unable to move them without great pain. In winter my suffer-
ings were more severe and I was compelled to remain indoors and sit by the
fire. I could do no work whatever, and at times it was necessary for me to use
a crutch In order to get around. I took about a barrel full of medicine in all, to
say nothing of the quantities of external applications, which had no more ef-
fect than so much cold water. I was blistered with liniments, plasters, etc., add-
ing to my suffering. All this was owing to my prejudice to patent remedies,
for every one of my friends had something to offer me. Finally my prejudice
was overcome, because I was getting worse and the doctors did not relieve me,
so I commenced the use of patent remedies. Unfortunately, I did not commence
with Hudyan, for at that time there was nothing to recommend it to me any
more than the others. My condition did not improve, as far as I could deter-
mine, but nevertheless I kept on until I reached your remedy, Hudyan. I had
very little faith in it, but, having bought six boxes at one time, decided to take
at least that much. When I finished that lot I felt a trifle bettorâ there was not
a great deal of encouragement, but I was going to get the full benefit if there
was any to be obtained. I procured another supply and from then on results
were surprising. My symptoms left me, and I began to feel that I was cured.
Winter came on, and though I exposed myself considerably, none of the pre-
vious symptoms came on, and lam now cured. It is now five months since I
discontinued the use of your remedies, and I have not had the slightest pain, nor
any sign of stiffness in my joints. I feel grateful to the doctors for assisting me
to retain perfect health, and I can assure you that I will recommend Hudyan
to any person who may be afflicted as I was. I am, very respectfully,

TWO MURDERERS
NOW SURRENDER
Voluntarily Give Them
selves Up.
WERE CHASED FOR YEARS
IMPLICATED IN THE KILLING OF
COLONEL FOUNTAIN.
Indictment of Cattle Thieves in New
Mexico Led Up to the Assassina
tion of the Prosecuting
Attorney.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EL PASO, Texas, March 13.â This
morning Oliver M. Lee and James Gil
liland, the alleged murderers of Colonel
A. J. Fountain and his eight-year-old
son, Henry, boarded a south-bound
Santa Fe train at Aleman, N. M., and
rode to Las Cruces, where they were
met by District Judge Parker and sur
rendered to him.
The murder of which the two men
are accused is the greatest mystery in
the Southwest. Colonel Fountain came
to Lincoln. N. M., in 1862. He took an
active part in politics on the Republi
can side, and as District Attorney won
the lasting hatred of the criminal
classes. In January, 1895, he went from
Las Cruces to attend court as attorney
for the New Mexico Stock Association
and secured indictments for cattle
stealing against Lee, Gilliland and Mc-
New, three men now accused of his
murder.
Lincoln is about 130 miles northeast
of Las Cruces, with no railroad com
munication, and Fountain started home
in a two-horse buckboard with his
eight-year-old son Henry. On February
1, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, he
was seen for the last time by a mail
carrier between Las Cruces and Lunas
Wells.
Just before meeting Fountain the
mail carrier saw three men riding
ahead turn off at his approach. Foun
tain was anxious and asked who they
were. He failed to reach home and
when the mail carrier arrived at Las
Cruces and told his story a posse w-ent
out and found the buckboard aban
doned far off the road. There were
trails of several horses following and
footprints around it. No arrests were
made until about a year ago. Then
warrants were issued for Lee, Gilliland
and McNew. McNew was arrested and
held without bail. Lee and Gilliland
were warned and fled. Subsequently
they fired upon a posse and killed one
man.
The surrender was prearranged be
tween the fugitives and the authorities,
with one conditionâ that they should
not be given into the custody of Sheriff
Garrett, who is a bitter personal enemy.
The body of Fountain, so far as known
positively, was never found, but it is
stated on good authority that it has
been secretly in the possession of the
authorities for some time past. A
skeleton supposed to be that of a little
boy was found a few weeks ago, but
was removed by unknown parties be
fore the officers reached the spot.

of Success.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyright, 1899, by
James Gordon Bennett.
MANILA, March 14.â Nqon.â At 7 j
o'clock this morning, hearing the in
surgent bugles sounding, Scott's bat
tery dropped three shrapnel shells
into the woods on the left of the
Pasig Church. No reply was made,
and at 7:45 the Twenty-second In
fantry advanced until they encount
ered a number of volleys. This fire
was returned with interest.
The line then wheeled toward Pa
teros in the following order: The
Oregon Volunteers, the Twentieth
regulars, the Washington Volunteers,
a cavalry detachment, the Twenty
second regulars and reserve artillery.
The troops followed the roads, while
the gunboats Oesta and Laguna de
Bai assisted in suppressing the fire
on the left flank. Three rebel canoes \
were captured on the river. The rebel :
sharpshooters at Caloocan continue j
active, but no casualties are reported.
MANILA, March 13.â The flying col
umns under General Wheaton started
an aggressive campaign against the in
surgents this morning. The line con
sisted of three troops of the Fourth
Cavalry on the extreme right, and next
in their order the Twenty-second In
fantry, the Twentieth Infantry, the
Oregon Volunteers and the Washing
ton Volunteers. The latter, on the ex
treme left, were opposite Guadaloupe,
on the river.
A lieutenant of Scott's battery fired
the signal gun at five minutes of 7
o'clock, and at once the Fourth Cav
alry, mounted, swung forward. Then
all the infantry regiments, formed in
three lines, left their trenches and
moved on the enemy. It was a beauti
ful sight this clocklike regularity of
advance. The ravalry met a heavy
fire on the right, and the men dis
mounted and drove the enemy out of
their intrenchments.
In the distance cnuld be heard the
firing of General Ovenshine's brigade,
â who had made a feint on our right.
General Wheaton followed the ad
vance of the firing lines and joined
with his staff in the forward move
ment. On we went, while the gunboat
Laguna de Bai poured in a heavy Gat
ling fire from the river and Scott's bat
tery threw shells over our heads into
the enemy's trenches with magnificent
precision.
As the Twenty-second Regiment
swung around to corner the insurgents
in Guadaloupe, I saw Filipinos emerg
ing from the deep trenches, whence
they had been pouring a heavy fire on
our advancing men.
As we closed in on Guadaloupe, a
party of insurgents at the church stood
their ground. I counted eight dead Fil
ipinos here. We also took some pris
oners at this point, but most of the
enemy escaped to Pasig. The prison
ers say they did not wish to fight, but
were forced into the service. Some
rifles were also captured here.
The Twentieth Infantry were the
first troops to reach Guadaloupe
Church.
While the right column was swinging
toward the town of Pasig the left ad
vanced, pouring volleys into the bush.
At 7:30 a. m. the river gunboat start
ed toward Pasig. The rebels were first
encountered by this vessel in the jungle
near Guadaloupe. Steaming slowly, the
gunboat poured a terrific fire from her
Gatling guns into the brush. For all
of an hour the whirring of the rapid
fire guns alternated with the booming
of the heavier pieces on board.
The gunboat was stopped by sunken
stones and cascoes (native lighters) in
the river. The country is very rough,
and the advance was necessarily slow.
This is the reason the insurgents were
able to escape.
The prisoners told us the insurgents
â¢were in strong force at Pateros, at
lease 500 being gathered there.
In the meantime Scott's battery
ashore was shelling the trenches and
driving the enemy' back. The artillery
then advanced to the ridge of bamboo
and drove a few of the enemy's sharp
shooters away with volleys from their
carbines. The artillery advanced and
met with little opposition.
In the meantime the infantry had
been sent forward in extended order,
the Washington Regiment resting on
the bank of the river, each regiment
deploying on reaching its station and
furnishing its own supports.
The entire column wheeled toward
the river, driving the enemy toward his
supports, and then advanced on Guad
aloupe. The artillery moved to a ridge
commanding Pasig and Pateros.
By this time the enemy was in full
flight along a line over a mile long, and
the firing was discontinued temporarily
in order to give the troops a rest be
fore making the attack on Pasig. The
enemy's loss was believed to be severe,
but only eight Americans were
W At n ln?s stage of the engagement it

returned the attack on Pasig. Scott's
battery supported by two companies of
the Twentieth Regiment, advanced on
C uadaloupe by the road along the river
bank^remainder of the Twentieth
Regiment and the Twenty-second Regi
ment following with the reserve arrf he
Oregon volunteers. At 11.30 a. m. tne
column came in contact with the en
emy, and the gunboat, which had
cleared the obstructions, steamed to the
firing line and cleared the jungle on
both Bides, while the battery to.* up
a position on a bluff at the right. The
first shot from the American field
pieces, at 1200 yards range, dislodged
a gun of the enemy at Pasig.
After the town had been shelled the
Twentieth Regiment lined up on the
Mufl^and the .Twenty-second too|k uj> a |
position on the left of the place, with j
the cavalry in the center, whereupon
the enemy retreated to the town. The
gunboat then moved into a bend oppo
site and a hot fire on the rebel position
was maintained along the whole Amer
ican line until 2:20 p. m., when prepa
rations were made for the attack.
At 3 p. m. our gunboat started in pur. j
suit of the enemy's armed tug, chasing j
her to the lake. At 3:30 p. m. a large j
body of the enemy was discovered
working around our right flank, and
the Twentieth Regiment was moved to
a commanding ridge. The rebels were '
met opposite Patems, but the enemy !
bolted. Thirty of the rebels were killed, I
as already cabled, sixteen more taken
prisoners and the Americans lost six
men wounded. The whole American
line bivouacked at 5 o'clock. About 700
rebels were reported to be marching
northward a few miles to the south- I
west.
Negotiations between General Rios
and Aguinaldo for the liberation of the
Spanish prisoners have been stopped,
owing to Otis' refusal to allow the
Spanish commission to return to Ma
lolos on the plea that if the ransom
was paid it would increase the strength
of the insurgents against America.
General Otis has also refused to al
low General Rios to take arms and am
munition from Manila to reoccupy the
Carolines. It is reported that the Span
iards at Zamboanga sold a quantity of
ammunition to the natives of Minda
nao, hence their shortage.
The steamer Puerto Rico will convey
troops from Zamboanga to reoccupy
the Carolines, the Marianas (Ladrones)
and Palaus.
The Spanish gunboats El Cano, Sa
mar, Readagua, Pampanma, Albayo
Calamiaps, Ordinola, Bases, Gordoque,
Panao, Manileno, Mindoro and Mara
valles, lying at the Zamboanga Islands,
off Mindanao, have been sold to Fran
cisco Reyes for 201,110 Mexican dollars.
They will probably be resold to the
highest bidder or they may be trans
formed into merchantmen.
CAROLINE ISLANDERS
WANT AMERICAN RULE
WASHINGTON, March 13.â A corre
spondent of the State Department,
writing from Ponape, Caroline Islands,
says the inhabitants like everything
that is American. They are hoping and
praying, he says, that the Americans
will take possession of all the islands,
and if not all at least the island of Po
nape.
WILL NOT RETREAT
WHILE UNDER FIRE
WASHINGTON, March 13.â 1t is ex
pected that General Otis will be author
ized to- organize three or four regiments
of the provisional army out of the vol
unteers from the various States now at
Manila when the time comes for mus
tering out these volunteers. At present
the volunteers, it is stated at the War
Department, do not want to- come home,
having the American determination not
to "retreat while under fire."
RIOS WOULD APPEAL
TO THE POWERS
MADRID, March 13.â General Rios,
the Spanish commander in the Philip
pines, in an official dispatch acquaint
ing the Government with the fact that
Major General Otis has stopped the ne
gotiations for the release of the Spanish
prisoners in the hands of the rebels,
says :
"I protest in the name of humanity,
and believe the time has arrived to ap
peal through the Consuls to the good
offices of the powers."
The dispatch also says: "I am told
that the Filipinos are at war with the
Americans and that the prisoners can
not be ransomed for money,' as that
would improve the position of the in
surgents. In view of the situation be
tween the Americans and the Filipinos
I await the orders of the Government."

â¦ of these men, although until the full regiment is on the scene the ma- +

HAVANA, March 13.â A public mani

patriotic clubs, in which the general
public assisted, was held this afternoon.
The people who took part in the dem
onstration marched with music and
banners to Quinta.where they expressed
to General Gomez their adherence to
himself and their disapproval of the
action of the Cuban Assembly in re
moving him from the office of general
in-chlef of the Cuban army.

There were cheers last night for Gen
eral Gomez in Central Park and cries
were raised against the Cuban military
assembly. In the evening at the thea
ter the public vociferously applauded
General Gomez and Cuba. The feeling
against the assembly is still growing.
Should a portion of the Cuban army
support the assembly in rejecting the
Gomez-Porter agreement and in refus
ing to disband without a larger sum
than $3,000,000, forcible disarmament, in
the opinion of Americans well qualified
to judge, would follow. This is the only
grave fact in an otherwise entertaining
eequence of incidents.
The United States is completely com
mitted to the arrangements made by
Robert P. Porter with General Gomez,
and the details of the plan of distribu
tion are already far advanced. The
opinion of Cuban civilians is that a
considerable portion of the army, prob
ably the larger part, upholds General
Gomez in his contract with the United
States, and therefore the American mil
itary government sees no other way to
the disarming of any faction of the
Cuban troops which, being duly warned,
should persist in keeping the field.
CELEBRATORS COLLIDE
WITH HAVANA POLICE
HAVANA, March 13. â Frederico
Mora, civil Governor of Havana, when
he learned this morning of the prepara
tions for an outpouring of the people
in honor of General Gomez, directed
the police to prevent the parade. The
committee having the demonstration in
charge asked General Ludlow to revoke
Senor Mora's order. General Ludlow
replied that he would not do so.
General Brooke was then called upon
and asked by the committee for per
mission to parade. He sent a message
to General Ludlow saying that if the
procession was orderly he could see no
objection.
Meanwhile the police tried to pre
vent the demonstration. Chief of Po-
lice Menoral, with his mounted in
spectors and policemen by twos and
threes, attempted to turn back the
various societies who were marching
toward Quinta de los Molinas, the resi
dence of Gomez. At first little atten
tion was paid to these efforts. When
a policeman seized a flag or made an
individual arrest, the others in the line
would simply march on, jeering and
yelling "Down with the police," "Long
live Gomez," "Death to the Assembly."
Colonel Raoul Arango, an inspector,
took a flag away from an American
who was parading. Immediately sur
rounded by a menacing crowd he
clubbed one of the demonstrators till
the blood flowed. Then, dismayed by
the savage yells of the wounded man's
companions, he withdrew to another
point. Chief Menocal was mocked by
the crowd in the Tacon walk. When
near Quinta de los Molinas the demon
strators began to shove the policemen,
pulling their coats and attempting to
take away their clubs. There were
more than a hundred police within ten
blocks, but they did not act together.
Indeed they were thoroughly scared
and one policeman ran to Central Park,
where the Tenth regulars were camped.
The Twentieth regulars, who were
sent at double-quick with fixed bayo
nets to protect the policemen, charged
down upon a crowd of a thousand.
Everybody ran, including the police,
and men, women and children tumbled
over each other in the rush. Two min
utes later the avenue was cleared for
blocks, but not a person was hurt by
the regulars.
Eventually, without regard to the
police an immense crowd collected in
front of the residence of Gomez, the
summer palace, cheering and waving
more than 600 flags and banners. Gen
eral Gomez accompanied by many no
table persons soon made his appearance
upon the balcony and was greeted with
long continued cheers. Scores of bou
quets were flung at him. He made a
brief speech along the line of his ap
peal to the Cuban army and people of
yesterday and expressed his gratifica
tion at such an illustration of # public
approval. _________________
GONZALES DE QUESADA
DECLARED A TRAITOR
HAVANA, March 13.â The Cuban As
sembly met to-day. A motion was made
declaring Senor Gonzales de Quesada
a "traitor to the Assembly" and an
"accomplice of Gomez," and asking for
his expulsion. It was carried by a viva
voce vote.
A committee of three was then ap
pointed to draft an address to the Cu
ban people and army regarding Satur
day's action of the 'Assembly, with in
structions to report at to-morrow's
session. Then followed speeches by
Sanguilly, Portuendo and Aguerro, all
referring to the "lying statement" of
Gomez and repeating the charges made
against him on Saturday. The general
effect their utterances was a justifica
tion of Saturday's proceedings â a claim
that the Assembly was acting solely
with a view of obtaining a recognition
of the just duties of the Cuban soldiers.
All the speakers deplored "any
misjudgment at the hands of the Cu
ban people/_[_ j

ADMIRAL VILLAMIL
DIED TIED IN CHAIR
SANTIAGO DE CUBA. March 13.â
General Leonard Wood, Military Gov
ernor of the Department of Santiago,
In the presence of the adjutant gen
erals of the department, Colonel Bacon
and Captain Gilmore, Captain Scott,
Captain of the Port, and other officers,
positively identified yesterday the re
mains of the Spanish officer discovered
a few days ago among the rocks on
the shore about four miles west of El
Morro, as those of Admiral Villamil,
who commanded the Spanish torpedo
boat destroyers In the naval battle
which resulted in the destruction of
Admiral Cervera's squadron.
Accompanied by the officers named
and by others, General Wood went in
a tug to investigate personally as to
the truth of the report that the body
of a Spanish officer had been found,
tied in an armchair, at the point desig
nated. The report proved well founded.
Nearly opposite the point where the
wrecked torpedo-boat destroyer Pluton
lies General Wood found an armchair
with ropes around it. a skull, bones on
the ground and the ragged remnants of
the uniform of a captain in the Span
ish navy. It was evident that the buz
zards had stripped the bones of flesh.
It is understood â though as to this
there is no certainty â that Admiral
SAMPSON SEEKS
TO BE OMITTED
Would Advance Other
Naval Officers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 13.âSecre
tary Long has received a letter from
Rear Admiral Sampson in which the
admiral, after referring to the allega
tions that the list . of officers recom
mended for promotion for gallantry off
Santiago had failed of confirmation be
cause it contained his name, asked the
Secretary to immediately reappoint
these officers, omitting his name.
The text of Rear Admiral Sampson's
letter is as follows:
U. S. Flagship New York, First Rate,
Havana, Cuba, March 9, 1899.
Sir: I respectfully ask your attention to
the facts contained in this letter and that
it may be officially filed as part of my
record in the United States navy:
When the late war was threatening I
was placed in command of the North At
lantic fleet, and, after the declaration of
war, was appointed by the President a
rear admiral and conlirmed in my com
mand. This duty and responsibility
came to me entirely unsought, nor had
I any especial wish for it, though recog
nizing the groat honor then conferred
upon me. My sole aim was to achieve
success: to blockade Cuba, destroy Cer
vera's fleet and to maintain an efficient
war fleet.
It is not .necessary to dwell upon the
Incidents of the war, â which are all now
well known. Based upon these incidents
certain officers, distinguished for faith
ful service, were named by me, in the
exercise of my natural duty as com
mander-in-chief, for promotion or such
other reward as you. sir, might deem de
sirable. These names you have been
pleased to nominate to the United States
Senate for promotion and you have done
me the honor to admit my name to that
list of officers.
It now appears that the Senate, though
well disposed to most of the names on
that list, has, for reasons not necessary
to be here .discussed, objected to my pro
motion, has similarly failed to confirm the
deserving officers about whose merits
there has been no doubt or discussion.
Hitherto, undisturbed by any eager de
sire for advancement, or any other form
of reward for doing my duty. I have not
specially concerned myself with matters
outside of that duty. I have felt that I
have done my duty in the conduct of the
West Indian naval campaign to the ut
most extent of my ability as thor
oughly as I was able, and if no reward
should come I could be satisfied with the
conscientiousness of having done my best.
I did not, however, anticipate that dis
satisfaction with any act or acts of mine
would cause the Senate to withhold from
other officers a promotion which they
have well deserved and which has been
promptly granted in similar circum
stances to others.
I therefore respectfully suggest, Mr.
President, that your appointment of these
officers, about whom there is no discus
sion, should be at once renewed, in order
that they may at once secure their pro
motions under the personnel bill, to which
ihey are entitled and without creating
confusion. Very respectfully.
\V. T. SAMPSON.
The President of the United States,
through the Secretary of the Navy.
Secretary Long: will not accept the
suggestion made by Rear Admiral
Sampson in his letter and make recess
appointments of officers who failed of
confirmation at the last session of Con
gress. The matter will be allowed to
remain just as it stands until the next
Congress meets and then all of the
nominations will be sent in precisely as
they stood at the end of the last session.

CHEMICALS ARE
NOT EMPLOYED
So Declare Meat Men
of Chicago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 13.â Rapid progress
was made to-day by the Government
Court of Inquiry investigating the beef
controversy. Nearly a dozen witnesses
were examined, three of them being in
spectors of the Government Bureau of
Animal Industry, and the rest of them
employes in various capacities at sev
eral Chicago packing-houses. Colonel
Davis, recorder of the court, stated to
night that he was unable to approxi
mate the length of time it would take
to exhaust the list of Chicago wit
nesses, but it seems likely that two or
three days will be required before the
members of the court can leave for
Kansas City.
Dr. O. E. Dyson, who has been an in
spector at the stockyards since 1893, testi
fied that his duties were to look after the
other inspectors and to see that they do
their duty. He had twenty-five or thirty
men to look after and had reported only
two in a year for negligence. One came
late and the other was intoxicated. "An
Interval," ho said, 'â¢might elapse between
the going off and the coming on of an in
spector, but we are supposed to be very
strict in regard to that."
Dr. Dyson said that cattle condemned
at the ar.te-mortem examination in the
yards for various causes, if they passed
the post-mortem inspection, might, bo
brought into the packing-house and used.
He had never seen chemicals of any kind
used except borax and things of that
sort around the hog houses. He said that
a case of lumpy jaw does not necessarily
condemn the meat unless the disease is
generalized.
Dr. Charles E. McNeil, bureau inspector
at the beef and sheep house of Nelson
Morris & Co., was the next witness. He
was not aware of any chemicals having
been used In that establishment and had
no reason to believe or suspect that they
were so used.
Charles H. Emery, superintendent of the
Llbby, McNeil & Libby packing-house,
testified: "Our business is princlpally
canning," he said. "We do not do any
slaughtering directly, but animals are
killed for us by Swift & Co. No chemicals
are used or 'relied upon by us to preserve
canned beef. A very small quantity of
salt is used. In a two-pound can we use
one-half ounce of salt in solution."
James S. Morrow, assistant superin
tendent, at Libby, McNeil & Libby, cor
roborated the testimony of the previous
witness as to the process of canning
roast beef. lie said there was scarcely
any difference between grades of roast
beef, and that the distinction was made
mostly, he supposed, to compete with oth
ers in the business. There was very lit
tle difference as to quality. He did not
know whether there was any difference
in the price to the Government. He said
that about 50 per cent of cows were used
in canning.
Arthur Meeker, manager of Armour &
Co.'s packing house, said the accumula
tion of canned goods were held in Chi
cago, but the linn had also a large stock
in Kurope. The}- had on hand at the out
break of the Spanish war 500,000 pounds of
canned roast beef in Chicago and 140,000
pounds in New York. They sold two mill
ion pounds to the Government and also
250,000 pounds of corned beef. The wit
ness stated that no chemicals were used
to preserve the beef either while In
transit or in storage in an agency. The
witness stated that two ounces of jelly
was put into a two-pound can of roast
beef, but no salt. The jelly gave an at
tractive appearance to the meat and add
ed to the nourishment. About VA por
cent of the nourishment came out in the
first boiling processâ l^> per cent of solu
ble albumen. An extract of beef was
made out of it. No date was put on the
label on the roast beef cans, the con
tents being good. Meat thus preserved
six, eight and nine years was just as
good as if put up last summer. The
French Government required a date on
the can. The same kind of meat was
used in the cans furnished the United |
States Government.
Other men connected with Armour's
also testified that chemicals were never
used.

died immediately on reaching the shore,
the body being left abandoned among
the rocks where it remained undiscov
ered until a few days ago.
Admiral Villamil. it is known, was
wounded in the right arm and left leg.
General Wood put the bones together
showing the unmistakable marks of
wounds in these places. The identifica
tion was in every respect complete.
In the pocket of the coat was found
the fleet countersign for June 26, signed
by the late Captain Oviedo y Busta
mente, then Admiral Cervera's chief
of-staff.
Colonel Bacon and Captain Gilmore
carried the armchair, the tattered uni
form and the bones, tied together by a
handkerchief, to the tug. which lay
about four miles off. The identification
caused a sensation among the Span
iards here as Admiral Villamil was one
of the best-known strategists in the
Spanish navy and a man held In high
esteem by his countrymen.
General Wood, through the War De
partment, will notify the Secretary of
State of the finding of the remains so
that they can be removed to Spain, if
the Spanish Government so desires.
Pending final disposition they will be
kept at the arsenal here. The tattered,
uniform will also be held subject to
Spanish orders. The armchair is at
present in charge of Captain Scott.

VENTURA, March 13.â Previous re
ports regarding the extension of the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company's line
in this county for their main coast route
are now confirmed by the active work of
prominent men for the corporation. Dur
ing the past few days â in fact since Fri
dayâHon. Thomas R. Bard and Hon. D.
T Perkins, both of Hueneme. have been
engaged in interviewing property own

obtained signed agreements for a 100-foot
right of way. They do not make a direct
promise as to what will be done, but. ac
cording to the agreements, work must
be commenced within nine months. All
the property owners are told that the
work will commence within six months.
Also the announcement is made that the
road will be completed to Somis and
eventually to Chatsworth Park.
The company has applied to Camarillo

THE FACTS OBOUT QUARANTINE.
SIXXE public authority was first asserted to iso
late an infected district or sequester infected
travelers for forty days, a quarantine of time,
there has arisen in many countries an issue between
local and supreme jurisdiction over that subject. The
policy of our Federal Government has been in the
direction of wise co-operation with the States. Epi
demics arhong men are of subtle and sinister force.
Their contagion takes often a secret and sinuous path,
which science follows with difficulty, and which may
well baffle insufficient agencies of authority.
This being true, the Federal Government has wisely
added to its extensive power and instrumentalities the
element of local solicitude as a powerful prompter of
the active vigilance of the State. Working together
in harmony the two have saved this country from any
prolonged and disastrous invasion of yellow fever or
cholera.
Sanitary science has had great progress in the last
half century. Formerly yellow fever was a too fre
quent visitor in New York City, and raged as far
north as Halifax. New York was once divided by a
high board fence, Crossing the island at Grand street.
In this fence were guarded doors, and communication
was cut off with the part of the city from the fence
to Castle Garden to isolate a devastating epidemic of
yellow fever which raged in the lower part of the
town.
Our San Francisco climate is not especially favor
able to febrile epidemics, but we are in such close
commercial relation with Asiatic ports, where these
plagues are endemic, that we cannot afford to omit
any precaution against their importation. For a long
time there was resistance to any Federal quarantine
here lest it should furnish footing for evasion of our
Chinese exclusion laws.
Even our members of Congress, in deference to
this form of the anti-Chinese movement, were listless
about securing Federal co-operation in quarantine.
During that time the practice was established of put
ting the matter in the hands of a quarantine officer
appointed by the San Francisco Board of Health,
who boarded incoming ships, to grant or withhold a
clean bill of health or free pratique.
When Federal quarantine was established here and
a station was located on Angel Island the city quar
antine officer continued to exercise this authority, and
the result has been annoying to commerce and ship
owners. Numerous clashes of authority have oc
curred, and for a time there was high friction with the
Federal authorities.
All this was caused by the non-appearance of the
State in the field of co-operation. The policy of the
Federal Government being clearly in the direction of
working in harmony with the State 'authority, and
there being no assertion thereof, it could no more
co-operate in this important function with a munici
pal officer than it could divide jurisdiction with the
bailiff of one of our police courts.
The public has in turn blamed each side of the
controversy, when no special blame attached to either,
for the whole difficulty arose in the absence of any
official representative of the State.
A bill is before the Legislature to provide what has
been lacking, by authorizing the appointment of a
quarantine officer representing the State Board of
Health. This will supply the needed and essential
presence of the State for Federal co-operationÂ» and
the relations of the two jurisdictions will amicably
adjust themselves for the facility of commerce and
the protection of the people against the diseases of
Asia which may be carried on shipboard. It is to be
hoped that the bill will pass, and thus additional pro
tection will be given. This is needed in view of the
increase in our Asiatic and Pacific contacts. We must
watch leprosy from Hawaii as well as smallpox and
typhus from Manila, cholera from Yokohama and the
bubonic plague from Hongkong. The friendly and
scientific co-operation of the State and Federal Gov
ernments will give a sense of safety needed to protect
our community against epidemic panics and prevent
the losses which they cause.
There is not the slightest reason for supposing that
the human fragments found at the garbage crematory
indicate that a murder has been committed. Mur
derers as a rule do not pickle their victims, nor do
they scatter the fragments about so as to catch the
eye. The limit of the sensation is that some callous
medical student has been indecently heartless in dis
posing of a subject.
It is not believable that a reward of $50,000 is out
for the murder of Aguinaldo. With such a chance to
make money some of the Filipino's trusted leaders
would have had his head in a basket long ago.
Rumors that the military governors in Cuba clash
is fairly good evidence that they are on good terms.
THE END OF GAMBLING.
THE Board of Supervisors yesterday stood by
its moral, official and public duty. Resisting
all blandishments and no doubt putting many a
temptation behind them, the members by an almost
unanimous vote passed the ordinance prohibiting
pools and bookmaking on the races. If was at once
sent to the Mayor and was promptly signed, putting
it beyond reconsideration and making it the perma
nent law of the city unless repealed. Repeal bei,ng
more difficult than reconsideration, and reconsidera
tion being more difficult than defeat in the first in
stance, it will be seen that this moral ordinance is
now the farthest possible remove from danger. The
Call has made plain its position on this subject. . The
list of offenses, of the fall of men and. women, the
losses of good name, character and estate which we
compiled and published as a history of the ruin
wrought and degradation caused by track gambling,
long and distressing as it was, told but a fraction, of
the harm and sorrow and blighted life traceable .to
this affluent fountain of evil and corruption]- It has.
caused the betrayal of public and private trusts, of,
personal obligations, of the most sacred bonds that
can tie a man to his conscience and a woman -to her
honor.
With no inconsiderable knowledge of the world
and much observation of the weaknesses of .human
nature and the pitiful lapses to which men are prone,
we confess to an unusual sense of the appalling depths
to which one may fall when the feet slip once on the
downward way which the Supervisors have now
closed. The husbands who are fugitives from justice
01 serving sentences in prison, the sons who have
broken the hearts of their parents and the women
whose lives are eclipsed in dishonor, rise in ghastly
ranks to accuse the track gamblers of their undoing.
It is sometimes said that men deserve no praise for
doing their duty, but this hardly holds in this case.
Long sufferance and protracted tolerance of this evil
had given it the shelter that time and indifference
throw around immemorial custom. The poolsellers
and bookmakers could enlist on their side quite re
spectable business interests and could avail themselves
of the neutrality of the indifferent to such an extent
that, lacking moral conscience, the Supervisors could
have evaded the responsibility which they have met
and discharged gallantly like men. They deserve ap
plause; they merit every assurance of popular ap
proval, and the city cannot too much honor them.
F-very wife and mother, every man and woman, and
every boy and lad in this city is safer to-day than yes
terday. The happiness of every home, the honesty of
every man and the honor of every woman is safer
than before.
The pulpit has its share of the public gratitude. It
rallied unitedly in demanding that the law remove
this lure and leading into- temptation. The ministers,
in temperate and restrained but truthful and heart
reaching terms, held up the evil and summoned the
forces of public authority to provide its remedy. They
fulfilled their moral office and did it timely and wejl.
The Call congratulates the city that a shadow has been
lifted from its form and thanks the Supervisors who
heard the tumult without, demanding an end to this
vice, and the still, small voice within which prompted
the duty so well arid quickly done.
WORKINGMEN fIND THE EXPOSITION.
Q CTION taken by the Building Trades Council
a in adopting a resolution favoring the proposed
Pacific Ocean Exposition adds an important
element of strength to the movement and will go far
toward bringing it to success. The action is there
fore in the highest degree gratifying and will be so
regarded by all progressive men throughout the city.
It would have been a serious handicap indeed if
San Francisco had been compelled to undertake the
great enterprise without the earnest co-operation of
her workingmen. The opposition of a futile news
paper owned by a non-resident and run for boodle
purpdses can be ignored; but antagonism to the
movement on the part of any influential part of the
community would have been disastrous.
The exposition will be of benefit to all classes of
people and all* interests of the Pacific Coast. It will
stimulate trade and industry in a thousand ways. Such
have been the results accomplished by expositions held
in other parts of the Union, and there is no reason to
doubt they will be attained here. It is worth noting
in this connection that the exposition at Omaha last
summer was so successful, despite the war, that the
managers of the enterprise propose to hold another
on the same site during the coming season.
The Pacific Coast has never had a great exposition
elaborately worked out. The best accomplished so
far was the Midwinter Fair, which was hurried along
with insufficient means and was opened before it was
fully advertised. Thus it did not bring to the city
anything like the benefits it would otherwise have
done; and yet it must be borne in mind it relieved the
stagnation of that season of panic and depression and
gave employment to many who otherwise would have
been without wages during that dreary winter.
The coming exposition will be conducted on dif
ferent lines. ,It will put into circulation a large
amount of idle home money and also bring large
-sums from abroad. When once launched an appro
priation of $500,000 from the General Government is
assured. Other States will also make appropriations
for expenditure here. Such expenditures will pro
mote industry in all lines and will be particularly bene
ficial to the building trades. All workingmen are
therefore as interested in the enterprise as are the
merchants, manufacturers and land-owners, and the
council of the building trades has acted wisely in
adopting resolutions approving it.
SENATORIAL ELECTIONS.
BY way of variety in the discussion of reforms in
Senatorial elections, the . Eastern press has
turned from the ; familiar proposition of pro
viding for such elections by direct vote of -the people
to a new scheme of enabling deadlocks to be broken
in legislative bodies by authorizing the election of
Senators by a plurality instead of a majority vote.
The new plan, which was submitted to Congress in
a bill by Senator Hoar, provides "if no person shall
have received a majority after seven separate ballots
in joint assembly, one of such ballots at least having
been taken on seven separate days, the person who
receives a plurality of all the votes cast. on the next
ballot, or, if there be no plurality, on the first subse
quent ballot where any person shall have a plurality,
a majority of all the members of both houses being
present and voting, shall be declared duly elected."
Such a change in the system of electing Senators
would be less radical than that of providing for a
direct vote of the people and will therefore be at
tractive to conservative reformers. It has, however,
very little beyond its conservatism to commend. It
is in the nature of a- compromise which, in' operation
would probably prove to be a surrender of the whole
issue by the reformers and a complete victory for the
corrupt elements in politics.
Election by a plurality vote after the seventh joint
ballot would indeed break a deadlock, but it would
in most cases break it to the advantage of some can
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1899.
didate utterly unworthy of the office. It would open
the door of the Senate, for aspirants who could never
command a majority vote nor obtain the suffrages of
the people, and such results would be worse than the
most prolonged deadlock we are ever likely to see.
The very fact that such a plan has been submitted
to Congress is significant of the tone of public senti
ment on this subject. It shows that even among the
mor.e conservative citizens there is a general recogni
tion of the evils growing out of the present system of
electing Senators and a desire to provide a remedy.
â It iÂ£ evident the issue cannot be much longer ignored
or postponed. Deadlocks and worse scandals are be
coming too common in these periodical contests be
fore the Legislatures, and the consequences are too
disastrous to ordinary legislative business. A change
is inevitable, bat when it is accomplished ft 'should
not' be a 1 compromise. The only remedy
for the abuse is the popular one of electing Senators
by direct vote 1 of the people.
THE BANKS OND.THE LEGISLATURE.
THE existing depression in country property and
apprehension induced by the limited rain supply
were only proximate or exciting causes of the
suspension of the County Bank and the Commercial
Bank of San Luis Obispo and the Bank of ' Paso
Robles. The real or fundamental reason for these
failures was a loose method of conducting busines^
'unchecked through the defective organization of the
Bank Commission of this State and inefficiency on
the part of the present Commissioners. A few figures
will establish these propositions. As appears by
a communication from Mr. Evan J. Coleman, first
president of the Bank Commission, published in an
other column, in the case of the County Bank of San
Luis Obispo, as far back as May 18, 1895, the dis
proportion between its available and convertible as
sets and its liabilities was inexcusable. But its condi
tion on August 31, 1898, was more serious. At that
time its investments in bank premises, in real estate
taken for debts and in loans on real property aggre
gated $407,170 97. Its loans on stocks, bonds and
other personalty amounted to $3-2,7-29 68; and on
'perspnal security," which means individual credit, it
had outstanding the large sum of $162,308 51. Its
money on hand and due from banks footed up only
$25,149 86. Its liabilities to depositors and banks
were $385,969 34. Obviously from these figures, taken
from the report of the Bank Commissioners more 1
than six months ago, while the ultimate solvency of
the bank might have been assured if real estate had
not proved inconvertible, the disparity between its
debts and its credits was so wide that it was not in
a condition to transact ordinary banking business and
was. at the mercy of any "run" that might be pre
cipitated by local or transitory conditions. These
facts should have been comprehended by the Com
missioners and the bank at once forced to stop or
to increase its immediately available funds. Its of
ficial statement of December 31, 1898, printed in The
Call of yesterday, showed that it had proceeded from
bad to worse. The amount of money tied up in the
bank premises, in surrendered real estate and in pend
ing loans on real property had then increased to $466,
--559 10, and the loans on "personal security" to $178,
--222 21, while the money on hand and dus from banks
was reduced to $12,776 76, and the deposits and in
debtedness to other banks had been enlarged to $449.-
473 37-
The County Bank of San Luis Obispo is the chief and
originating factor in the financial disturbance in that
county, but under proper supervision and control its
bad management might have been arrested and the
injury liable to result from its suspension averted.
Apart from the criticism that may be justly directed
to the Commissioners, in its issue of February 17,
1899, The Call specially invited the attention of the
Legislature to a practical remedy for unsafe banking,
then suggested by Mr. Coleman, who proposed that
the present statute should be amended so as to en
large the number of Commissioners to five, to reduce
the salary of each to the original figure of $3000
per annum and to compel the disclosure to the public
and to the Commissioners of all assignments and hy-
pothecations of securities. The provision for public
ity was essential, because the law directing advertised
semi-annual statements from each bank had been re
pealed, which deprived depositors of official informa
tion, without which they were in constant danger.
The additional expense of this economical measure,
only $4200 in each year, would have inflicted no addi
tional burden upon taxpayers, because it was provided
that the cost and the restricted expenses of the Com
mission should be collected by an assessment trans
ferred from the deposits to the entire resources of the
banks that would not exceed 8 cents in $1000.
As usual, however, private interests and private in
fluences in this important matter have so far over
balanced thÂ£ public welfare, and the end of the leg
islative session has been almost reached without the
adoption of the improvements in the law that at least
temporarily, until a better system could be devised,
would have prevented loss and ruin to thousands of
industrious and economical citizens. Bills covering
the proposed amendments were introduced both in
the Senate and in the Assembly. For some inexplicable
purpose the Assembly bill was withdrawn. The Sen
ate bill was retained and is ready for the third reading,
but it has been injudiciously amended so as to fix the
office of the Commissioners at Sacramento instead
of San Francis.co, where the principal banks are lo
cated, and the salaries of the five Commissioner at
the present rate, $3600 each per year, while "necessary
traveling expenses," placed by Mr. Coleman at $2000,
are raised to $5000 per annum. Meanwhile one of the
items for printing useless reports crammed with un
intelligible statistics? which it was intended to lop off,
has been illustrated in the general appropriation bill,
a; we are informed, to the tune of $4000.
The question of protecting the earnings and depos
its of the people in savings and in commercial banks
is not political, has no connection whatever with the
Senatorial deadlock or with the defunct State Harbor
Commission bill, and should not be considered in re
lation to patronage or under the advice or pressure
of interested parties. Its deep significance has been
painfully manifested within the past week. A Com
mission of five, in which not more than three should
be of the same party, could attend to its duties and
examine the condition of the banks without strain or
undue procrastination. For traveling expenses $2000
is^ an ample annual allowance. ThrjÂ»e thousand
dollars per annum for each Commissioner is a
sufficient compensation and equals the sal
ary of many of our Superior Judges. The
entire cost of the Commission s-hould be
defrayed, not by the depositors but by the banks,
to which the amount would be a mere bagatelle. And
there is no reason whatever for any tax upon the peo
ple for bulky printing that conveys no available in
formation and actually dwarfs the annual reports of
the National Comptroller of the Currency.
We sincerely hope that the pressure of facts thus
brought directly to its notice, that affect the sub
stantial interests of the people, may induce the Legis
lature to restore Senate bill No. 678 to its original text
and to enact it into a law that will afford provisional
and essential relief, the necessity for which was never
more urgent and is not likely to be soon diminished.

A comparison of the salient points in
the bank's condition in May, 1895, and
a little over three years later shows the
following changes for the worse:
Firstâ The real estate taken for debt
increased $162,445, making the total
amount tied up in unproductive prop
erty (including the bank premises) the
large sum of $241,612, which absorbed
the whole of the paid-up capital and
SU Second-The amount borrowed from
other banks in the meanwhile had in
creased over $19,000 and amounted to
a total of $63,082.
Thirdâ Unsecured loans and over
drafts were $162,308. ..-â_, Â,-,
Fourthâ Money on hand had dwindled
to $22,780, which was only 7 per cent
of the deposits. â "â
Fifthâ The deposits had fallen off
In fact everything indicated that the
bank had been doing a losing business
for the preceding three years and was
in a very unhealthy condition.
Any competent Bank Examiner would
have declared the bank in an unsafe
condition last August (if not before),
and the Commissioners were derelict in
their duty in allowing the bank to con
tinue in business. E. J. COLEMAN.

HOBSON'S PROMOTION.
How It Was Brought About and
What It Really Amounts To.
The promotion, so called, of Naval Con
structor Hobson is far from being what
he and his friends expected It to be. The
nomination advancing him from number
one on the list of assistant naval con
structors to number eight on the naval
constructor's list was apparently pushing
him up fourteen numbers, but as he had
already advanced five numbers and bo
came a naval constructor June 23, 1898,
through the usual process of promotion,
his advancement is, therefore, only from
NR. 17 to No. 8, as a reward for unparal
leled heroism.
It has been understood ever since the
whole country heard of his exploit and
plans .were being devised of how to prop
erly reward such service, that Hobson
preferred entering the line corps, and it
was quasi officially announced that his
place would be last on the list of lieu
tenant commanders. In this event and
without the Intervention of the navy per
sonnel bill just passed Hobson would have
become a rear admiral in ten years hence
at the age of 39. On June 27 last the Pres
ident, in a message to Congress, recom
mended that the thanks of Congress lie
extended to Hobson and his fellow heroes,
and that the gallant leader be transferred
to the line and promoted to such position
therein as might be determined. Hobson
received the thanks of Congress very
promptly, but the advancement to the line
did not follow, and now he gets only an
advance of nine numbers in the naval
constructors' corps, equivalent to pushing
nine of the constructors down one num
ber each. The service he rendered was
in the line of duty as a line officer and
not that of a naval constructor, hence his
new place should be in the line corps.
The entire line, however, was opposed
to the advancement of Hobson, and the
Crowninshield-Sampson-Cooper combine,
which represents the ultra line sentiment
against the staff, appear to have chiseled
the young hero out of his merited reward.
Without the passage of the navy reor
ganization bill Hobson would have re
ceived no substantial reward by over
slaughing nine constructors. He would
only reach the relative rank of- comman
der in 1901 and that of captain in 1920.
Under the operation of the new navy per
sonnel bill the number of naval construct
ors with the rank and pay of captain is
Increased from two to five, commanders
from three to five and the others are
raised from lieutenants to lieutenant
commanders. Under this law Hobson will
have the rank of commander at once and
that of captain on March 4, 1901, upon the
retirement of Chief Constructor Hichborn.
As the chief of Bureau of Construction
rs selected from any one of the twenty
two constructors his chances of becoming
chief of that bureau with the rank of
rear admiral are somewhat uncertain, and
even if he should be fortunate enough to
head the constructors' corps he will be a
rear admiral by rank only and not a com
mander in chief of a fleet. That Mr. Hob
son becomes a captain by rank In less
than two years is only because of the
workings of the new bill, for, as the re
cent recommendation for his promotion
shows, he was only to be promoted nine
numbers over the heads of other con
structors, with no increase in rank or pay
â the latter two only to follow upon re
tirement of those ahead of him:
The Washington clique worked their
game to perfection and even went bo far
as to have Hobson ordered to the Phil
ippines where, 10,000 miles away from
Washington, he would be powerless to
check the plot to steal away his merited
reward. In ten months hence, however,
Congress will again be in session and
Hobson's friends will make an effort to
right the wrong and place him in the
corps for which he rendered such signal
service and for which he would not have
been selected but for eminent fitneÃs
above all the other young line officers in
the Sampson squadron. A. J. F.

â  , t is exemplified by
a story told by Jim McCorxnack, the So
nora merchant, who was in the city last
week. Jim is the leading purveyor of
meats Jn his town, and his tale concerns
a little pig. ' " Â _, _ _
"The Vine Spring ranch," said McCor
mack, "is located a few miles from So
nora, and the bead of the pipe line which
supplies the water to the Tuolumne Elec
tric Power Company is on the ranch, The
rancher raised pigs for a while, but he
I doesn't any more. About a year ago a
shoat not bigger than a good-sized . cat
did about $200,000 damage to several peo
ple and pig raising in my section is now
prohibited. It happened this way. The
electric power company supplied light to
the towns of Sonora and Columbia, and
also transmitted power to the Rawhide
and App mines. One night that cussed
little rcoter got to prowling around and
began 'snooting' into the soft banks of
the water ditch Just above the pipe line
that leads down to the power house. The
shoat was an industrious little wretch,
and about midnight, when things were
lively in town and several- hundred men
were working in the mines he succeeded
in getting through the bank. In another
instant the water burst through the break
and the motor at the power house stopped
quicker than you can think about it. The
same instant the mines were in darkness,
the poker players in Sonora and Colum
bia grabbed for the pots with one hand
! and pulled their guns with the other, and
consternation prevailed all around. The
pumps at the hoists at the Rawhide and
App mines stopped work ! and the men
down below became panic-stricken. The
| superintendent of the power house could
I not Imagine what had happenedâ
! dynamos were all right, no fuses had
burned outâ it was some time before
ho learned that the trouble was with the
water supply. . :
"As soon as possible men were sen: up
the ditch to see what was the matter, but
they went above ' the place where the
shoat had burrowed through the bank,
and the trouble was not located until the
next day. By "that time the lower levels
in the mines were full of water (the min
ers were hauled up by hand during the
night) and several days elapsed before
the men could go .to work again. Old Cap
Nevills was daffy, and he threatened all
kinds of lawsuits, but the unlucky owner
of the pig mollified him by signing an
agreement never to allow a pig on his
ranch. The captain then sought to have
the Board of Supervisors 'pass a law pro
hibiting the raising of hogs in the county,
but there" were several farmers on the
boar.d, and they refused to comply.
"I need pigs in my business, but since
that shoat nearly wrecked the Rawhide
and almost inaugurated wholesale
slaughter in the poker rooms I have to go
outside the ditch country to get porkers.
It is hinted that the miners look upon the
succulent shoats as a menace to their
lives and property, and they kill them on
sight." c .-. ' _

JUDGE HUN
IN THE ROLE'
OF DETECTIVE
Arrests a Woman the
Pblice^Wanted.
KNEW HER BY A GOLF CAPE
MBS. MOLE CHAKGED WITH MIS
DEMEANOR EMBEZZLEMENT.
She Deserted Her Husband and Is
Suspected of Preferring a
Handsome Bugler at
the Presidio.
Judge Conlan distinguished himself yes
terday afternoon by discovering and ar
resting a woman who was wanted by De
fectives Ryan, O'Dca and Anthony on
a charge of misdemeanor embezzlement,
with two of her companions, a bugler at
the Presidio and her husband's niece.
Saturday morning Mrs. A. Burtis, 1269
Union street, who owns several houses in
that locality, swore to a complaint before
the Judge for the arrest of Mrs. May
Mole, who had been one of her tenants
at 1273 Union street, on a charge of mis
demeanor embezzlement. Mrs. Burtis al
leged that Mrs. Mole Friday morning
called upon her and asked for the loan
of her golf cape, as she was going to the
ferry to see a married couple off and
would return it in a few hours. Mrs. Mole
got the cape and left an adopted child in
Mrs. Burtis' care till she returned. She
did not come back, and Mrs. Burtis learn
ed that she had deserted her husband and
had taken with her all the money he had
saved, amounting to $52. It was "thought
that she had gone away with a bugler at
th MnL re Mole ; s husband, who is a laborer
employed by the gas company, called at
the office of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children Saturday and
asked their advice as to what he would
do with his adopted child as his wife had
deserted him. He was advised to take it
to the Infants' Shelter on Minna street.
The warrant for Mrs. Mole's arrest was
handed to the detectives and they ascer
tained that Saturday night Mrs. Mole was
joined by William Russell, a bugler in
Battery I at the Presidio, and that she
bought a lot of groceries and meat from
a butcher on Hyde and Union streets,
which she took to a house in the neigh
borhood. She cooked the meat and she
and the bugler and her husband s niece,
Mabel Richards, had supper together.
That was the last trace they got of her
till yesterday afternoon, when they iouna
the woman in the City Prison.
Judge Conlan when he signed the war
rant obtained from Mrs. Burtis an out
line of the story and a description of the
cape and the woman. He and Attorney
McMartin were walking along Market
street yesterday afternoon and at blxtn
street he saw a soldier accompanied by a
woman and a young girl. The csfpe worn
by the woman attracted the Judge s at
tention and he accosted them. -xt first
Mrs Mole denied her identity, but finally
confessed and said she was on her way to
deliver the cape to Mrs. Burtis.
The Judge called to Policeman O Shea,
who happened to be in the neighborhood,
and instructed O'Shea to take the trio to
the City Prison. There Mrs. Mole was
booked on the charge of m 'sderoeanor em
bezzlement and Russell and Mabel Rich
ards, a girl 16 years of age, were de
tained pending further investigation.
When searched Russell had $37 50 belong
ing to Mrs. Mole in his pockets.
Mrs. Mole said that her husband had or
dered her to leave the house or he would
kill her, and she had done so. The
money she took she had worked for, and
she considered it as much hers as her
husband's . She said that she had
gone to friends in Oakland Friday and
Sad remained there till yesterday morn
ne when she crossed the bay to see her
husband's sister. There she met Rang!
and Mabel. Russell is Mabel s &weet
heart She denied that she had seen
Russell Saturday night. She begged the
prison officials not to allow her husband
to see her as he might kill her.

AWFUL DEATH
Horrid Crime for Which
Mrs. Minnie Adams Is
Under Arrest.
FATHER OF BABE THE ACCUSER
Offspring of Wilson Gray Meets Death!
From Carbolic Acid Under Sus
picious Circumstances.
MRS. MINNIE ADAMS was arrested
at her father's home, 117 Parker
avenue, last night on suspicion of
having murdered her 2-year-old 11
--legitimate child, John Richard Gray, by
administering a dose of carbolic acid. A
Quarrel with the father of the child,
which resulted In the separation of the
couple, added to the fact that there were
too many mouths to be fed. is believed to
be the motive for the revolting crime.
The fathers of the child, Wilson Gray, id
the accuser of the woman, and had he
| not reported the matter to the police it
Is probable the death would have passed
- as an accident.
Yesterday shortly after noon Dr. H. A.
Nle'meyer reported to the Coroner's office
that a child had died from carbolic acid
poisoning at 117 Parker avenue. He had
been told that the baby picked up a bot
tle containing the acid in the yard and
swallowed the contents. Believing the
..statement made him by the mother, he
.gave it to Deputy Coroner Sullivan as he
.heard it, and the body, at the request of
â  the family, was allowed to remain at the
â¢ house. Dr. Zabala viewed the body last
night, and as there seemed to be no evi
dence of anything but an accident, was
satisfied that it was not necessary to per
form an autopsy.
- While the Coroner's officials were in
vestigating the case Wilson Gray, a
teamster for David Dillon, presented
himself at the O'Farrell-street station
and informed Sergeant Burke that he be
lieved a murder had been committed. The
sergeant notified the Chief of Police, and
he with Detective Graham went to the
home of Mrs. Adams to ascertain the
truth of the statement made by Gray.
From the investigations they made and
the evidence they secured they came to
the conclusion that Mrs. Adams had
killed the child. The woman was placed
under arrest and the body of the babe
was taken to the Morgue.
\ Mrs. Adams, who lives with her father,
John Tyrrell, has been separated from
her husband, John Adams, for some time.
About three years ago she became Inti
mate with Gray, and the two lived to
gether at the house of her father. A
child was born to them, and they con
tinued to live as man and wife until with
in the past two months, when Gray left
herâ claims because she took money
from his pockets at night.
The woman's version of the separation
is that Gray would return home drunk,
and she would take possession of the
money until he sobered up. This, she
claims, angered him and he threatened
to shoot her. .
On his return from work last night Gray
found the following note: "Come up and
B ee your child. He is dead." As he had
not been on very friendly terms with the
family he suspected the note was a ruse
and determined to notify the police. To
Eergeant Duke he confided the history of
his past relations with Mrs. Adams, and
eaid ho feared to go to the house alone
lest he should become the victim of foul
â  play He said he did not believe the baby
was dead, but stated that if the contents
of the note were true he felt certain that
the child had been murdered by its moth
er In support of this statement he told
the- sergeant that Mrs. Adams had wished
to get rid of the burden and once talked
of putting it In some home. A trifle over
a month ago. he claims. Mrs. Adams told
fclm that the â¢>:â¢â  had found a bottle of
carbolic acid, which she' had taken away
from him. She at that time made the
threat that If the child found the bottle
again she would let him swallow it.
To all appearances the case seemed
purely an accident and no evidence to
support the claim of murder was visible.
Every member of the family told a
straight story, but when closely ques
tioned by the police several contradictory
â¢ statements were made. The mother said
-that shortly before noon she heard the
boy crying in the back yard. She took
him into an outhouse, but soon brought
him out, closing the door after her. On
the sand in front of the place she saw a
bottle but thought nothing of it. Re
turning to the house she prepared to do
Borne cooking, when" she heard the child
cry again, and on going out to find the
cause, found him lying at the bottom of
the stairs, apparently in great agony, with
the bottle in his hand. She took him into
the bouse, and neighbors, who were called
In thought the child had spasms. Miss
X/e'na Kenney, who lives next door; smell
ed the acid and it was not until she re
marked this that the mother thought to
tell that the child had been holding a
â¢ bottle which, when she picked him up,
he threw over the fence. After some
time Dr. Neimeyer was summoned and
.a few moments after his arrival the baby
â¢was dead.
Where the bottle of acid came from Is
explained by Harrison Tyrrell, the 10
--year-old brother of Mrs. Adams, and the
police believe from his manner that he
was coached ou the story- Harrison says
L that on last Saturday, while playing with
Albert Blair, the child of a neighbor, the
tatter found the bottle in a vacant lot
â¢ near his home. The Tyrrell boy claims
that young Blair remarked. "That is a
good bottle." Harrison picked the bottle
- up he says, and put it in his pocket. La
; ter he placed It in the cellar of his home,
and after that hid it behind the outhouse.
According to his statement the bottle,
which Is a half-pint whisky flask, con
tained scarcely a tablespoonful of liquid.
Nearly a teaspoonful remained in the
flask when taken possession of by the
police.
â¢ The statement of Harrison Tyrrell Is
contradicted by Albert Blair. The latter
claims that he old not find the bottle,
didn't Bee the Tyrrell boy find It. and. in
fact, had never laid eyes on it until It was
In the hands of t're police. Ho told his
Eton.- to Sergeant â¢ Duke ao<l Detective
Graham in a straightforward manner
which differed greatly from the parrot
like story of his playmate.
While thÂ« statements made by Mrs.
Adams and her brother did not have the
air of truth about thorn, and wore con
tradictory at times, th? police found no
absolute evidence until they examined the
outbuilding:. When the door was opened
any lingering belief in the winds of tho
officer* that the troaw va\a'at be telling
the truth woa dispelled. There was a
Mreojf edot of carbolic Â»oW. which r*~
matned even after the door had stood j
open the quarter of an hour It took the \
police and Coroner's deputies to make
their investigation. The sand on the floor ;
and bits cf paper were saturated with
add and three boards were dampened j
with it. The boards, paper and sand j
were taken by the officers and will be
used as evidence against Mrs. Adams.
The mother of the child contradicted j
herself a number of times. Her first state- j
ment was to the effect that the boy fol
lowed her up the steps to the house after
she had taken him to the building. She
heard him say "Bum," a word he used
when he wished a drink of water. Yes
terday, instead of thinking he desired a
drink, she claims that she believed he j
was calling her a "bum." and replied, j
"All right, mamma is a bum." She then j
started to enter the house and, hearing |
him cry, turned back and saw him fall j
down the steps. Afterward she stated she j
had been in the house some time before j
she heard him cry. At one time she said j
she had left the boy in the outhouse and !
a few minutes later claimed that she had !
brought him outside and closed the door. â¢
From the amount of acid on the boards j
and sand, in addition to that swallowed 1
by the .child and found remaining in the j
bottle, the statement of Harrison Tyr- ]
rell that the flask originally contained j
but a tablespoonful is evidently a falsÂ«
hood.
Dr. Niemeyer said last night that the
must have swallowed more than a
tablespoonful. as it was not full strength,
and a quantity of it was required to
cause the death of even so small a child.
The face of the baby was badly burned,
showing that considerable of the fluid
must have run down and been absorbed
by the clothing.
It is the theory of the police that the
baby was given the poison by its mother
while they were in the outhouse together.
After administering the poison Mrs. Ad
ams probaly left the outhouse hurriedly
and the child followed her until he fell
at the foot of the stairs.
The scene at the home of the dead child
last nierht was most pathetic. In a little
cramped up. Illy lighted room, on a cot.
lay the baby with its white face burned
and scarred by the acid- The mother,
cool and seemingly little affected by the
death, sat beside her babe. John Tyrrell,
the aged grandfather, stood by his daugh
ter's side, with the younger children
standing near him. Wilson Gray, the
father of the dead baby and the accuser
of its mother, stood near the head of the
cot and accused his companion of the
murder of their child. The police officers
and Coroner's deputies, grouped near in
the dim light, cross-questioned the mem
bers of the family, while the curious
neighbors in the hallway craned their
necks to hear the story of the unnatural
crime.
John Tyrrell, the father of Mrs. Adams,
Is more than S<"> years of age. Working
at Laurel Hil! Cemetery for a paltry sai
ary. he has seven mouths to feed and
seven bodies to clothe. The hovel in j
which the seven people are housed con- j
tains but three moms, which the head of j
tho house apologetically explained con
talned nothing but h^ds. Mrs. Adams, j
with her three helpless children, was !
nothing but a burden to her aged father. !
The contemplation of the poor life they j
led doubtless drove her to think of some
means of lightening the burden, and in
revolving schemes in her mind the
thought came that one less mouth to feed
would relieve the stress, and the mur- j
der followed.
INTERNAL REVENUE LAW.
An Amendment That Will Be of In
terest to Distillers.
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch was
notified yesterday of the following amend
ments to the internal revenue laws:
Section 32ST, Revised Statutes, has been
amended by an act approved February 21, 1899,
as foil
â¢â Provided, however, that upon the applica
tion of the distiller, and under such regula
tions as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
with the approval of the Secretary of. the
Treasury, may prescribe, distilled spirits may
be drawn into wooden packages, each contain
ing two or more metallic cans, which cans
shall each have a capacity of not less than
five gal lens, win* measure, such packages to
be filled and used only for exportation from >

istrators, guardians and receivers appointed by ;

NO JOY, AT THE
CORRIGAN TRACK
The New Ordinance a
Dampener.
JOCKEY RUTTER IN GOOD FORM
BUT TWO FAVORITES CAPTURED
PURSES.
Yellow Tail Disqualified for an Un
discernible Midian Scored.
Ed Gartland Is Presented
With a Purse.
An air of gloom that nothing could dis
pel prevailed at the Corrigan track.
Everybody seemed to think that some
thing was going to happen, and when,
after the third event had been decided,
the news spread about that the Super
visors had swung the ax. little else was
talked about. The attendance was small
and the racing cheap and commonplace.
C. H. Harrison and Andrisa were the only
successful choices.
The Riley gelding Einstein, which races
in the colors of Earnshaw Bros., was
sent to the post favorite for the opening
mile Felling run. He took the lead from
Lorena in the run home, but was in turn
passed and beaten easily by Mldian, an
S to 1 chance, ridden by Frank Rutter.
LÂ«orena was a supposed good thing, but
could not last the route.
A mile and a furlong hurdle event fol
lowed, for which Mike Daly's mare Colo-;
nial Dame closed a slight favorite over
JazabeL The latter came to grief at the i
first obstacle, T. Murphy escaping injury.
By good handling. Glover landed Dur
ward winner over the favorite nearly a
length. Joe Cotton should have taken j
first money, but a stumble after taking:
the last jump cost him two lengths and
the race.
The Corrlgan gelding Carter H. Harri
son again found a soft spot in the third
event, a five-furlong; scramble, with a
light field of six starting. He was held at
ndds of 1 to 3 in the betting, and won by
himself. Jingle Jingie was beaten for the
place by Elsin.
The favorite Sardonic made a very pe
culiar showing in the mile and a sixteenth
Felling affair. Ed Gartland. fairly well
backed at heavy odds by Charley Quinn
and other smart ones, was allowed to cut
out his own pact- and was never headed.
Martin arrived home on the favorite a
neck before Tom Cromwell.
By clever riding Frank Rutter reached
the wire first aboard Gotobed in the next
number, also over one mile and a six
teenth. Benamela closed favorite, but
could not stay the route, and driving
hard, was downed a length by the sec
ond choice.
The favorite Andrisa led Yellow Tail
over the line in the 2-year-old scramble,
with Mortgage finishing third. McXichols.
who rode Mortgage, lodged a claim of
foul -with the judges against Wilson, the
pilot of Yellow Tail, and th*> judges
unwisely allowed it. This gave the show
money to Corrigan's well-played Alary's
Garter, and all's well that ends well, rt
was difficult to find a person who saw
the alleged fouling, but it must have oc

GREEN AND THE MYSTERIOUS.
The Pugilists Met Last Evening and
Failed to Match as They Could
Not Agree on Weight.
George Green, Alexander Greggains,
"Billy" Smith and "Jim" Kennedy, of the
Excelsior Athletic Club, met last evening
in a saloon on Stockton street and dis
cussed matters pertaining to a fight be
tween Green and Smith.
The pugilists agreed to nearly every
proposition suggested excepting weight.
Green said that as he had gained consid
erable avoirdupois in the past year he
could not consent to a fight with Smith
at any weight under 154 pounds and that
to be positive of meeting the obligation
the scaling time should be at noon of the
day of the fight.
Smith and his manager, Greggains.
would not consent to Green's proposition
of weighing in at noon, but they said
that if Green would sign articles to weigh
154 pounds at 6 o'clock on the evening of
the fight, everything pertaining to a mill
could be easily arranged.
Green was obdurate. He would not
give way an ounce and insisted on weigh
ing at high noon, and as a consequence
the meeting ended in smoke.
NEW COURSING GROUNDS.
The Ingleside Club Will Meet This
Evening to Discuss New Grounds.
The Ingleside Coursing Club will meet
this evening to discuss plans whereby
they may continue to follow the old sport.
Some of the leading members said that ;
although a removal from Ingleside Park !
will incur some expense, they hope, never- |
theless, to have a first-class coursing field i
in the near future within easy access of
San Francisco, on the San Mateo Electric
line, which will soon have two tracks i
running between this city and the .ter- j
minus in San Mateo County.
Doubtless; the old Ocean View Park, of j
which Professor Canavan was elected di- j
rector general some years ago. and which \
for some years past has been the home
of Italian vegetable gardeners, will again
be converted into a coursing park. The
site is a good one. and when the San
Mateo Company shall have completed its
vast improvements, the pleasure resort
can be reached easily in twenty minutes'
ride from the heart of the city.
Valley Road Notes.
The Valley road officials say that the
big 5600-foot Franklin tunnel back of Mar
tinez will soon be completed. There re
mains 1300 feet to be bored, and as the
force of men has been doubled progress
from now on will be rapid. The hastening
of the work is in consonance with the de
sire of the Santa Fe Company to operate
through trains to Stockton by July 1.
when its joint traffic agreement over the
Tehachapi is expected to go into effect.
There are now SOO men at work on the
sixty-nine miles of track between Point
Richmond and Stockton, and bids have
been invited for the construction of a tug
boat and passenger ferry, with the neces
sary boilers, and these will be hurried to
completion. _

opposite Port Arthur, in the
straits of Pechili and north of

portion of the ShangTung penin

LONDON. March 13.â Tn the House
of Commons to-day William
Pritchard Morgan, Liberal mem
ber for the Merthyr Tydvil Di
vision of Wales, who recently, in
behalf of a British and American
syndicate, obtained what appears to be
an immensely valuable concession in
the Chinese Province of Szechuan,
adjourn In order to call at
tention to the support given by the
British Minister at Peking, Sir Claude
MacDonaJd, to Italy's demand for the
(seizure of San Mun Bay. He declared
that Great Britain, the United States
and Japan needed expansion of trade,
and ii was a great mistake to support
Italy, whose claim was another step
toward the disintegration of China.
The Parliamentary Secretary of the
John Broderiek, defend-
Government's action. He said
Italy had for many years been the
friend and ally of Great Britain, and
r as Great Britain was concerned,
if. by diplomacy, Italy can persuade
China to make concessions, her Majes
ty's Government would welcome Italy's
arance in the Far East as an ally.
i "..ntinuinK. Mr. Broderiek said the
policy of her Majesty's Government
Mas to safeguard British interests, and
as long as they were not threatened,
not to stand in the way of friendly
powers taking steps to set forward
their interests. The motion to adjourn
waa negatived without a division.
Purinjr tho discussion of the naval es-
Henry Labouchere, Liberal
member for Northampton, moved a re
>n in the vote. He argued that
th â¢ Government was "'playing- the game
of 'beggar my miprhbor' against the
whole world," and h" declared it "fool
ish swagger to boast ability to build
Bhips than any other country."
Great Britain, he asserted, was not
richer than the United States nor
Franco and Russia combined.
John Dillon, Nationalist member, in
supporting the reduction, said: "Brit
ish statesmen who attempt to induce
the United States to abandon their
traditions by embarking in a wild ca

will bitterly regret it. for the day will

THREE POWERS
ADJUST TROUBLE
Samoan Affairs Have
Been Straightened.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 13.â After nu
: ;s conference-sand the exchange of
notes between Secretary Hay, the Brit
ish Emba^sador and the German Em
bassador. a satisfactory understanding
has been reached between the three
powers interested in Samoa as to the
conditions there. This seeks to open a
new account of Samoa and to obliterate
the troubles among officials which have
recently occurred there. To this end
Dr. Wilhelm Solf, who has been nom
inated by Germany as President of the
Alunicipal Council of Apia to succeed
Dr. Raflel, will be recognized by the
liritish and United States authorities.
Already this recognition is assured,
but it remains for the Consuls at Apia
to carry it Into formal effect, in ac
cordance with the letter of the treaty of
Berlin. In order that this may pave the
way to an agreeable and harmonious
adjustment, Dr. SoW will go to London
and make himself acquainted with the
authorities there and afterward come
to Washington and become acquainted
â with our officials, so that there may be
mutual understandings. Dr. Solf will
reach Washington the latter part of
this month and will be presented by
Dr. vcm Holleben, the German Embas
gador. He will then proceed to Samoa,
reaching there in May. His assump
toin of the Municipal Presidency with
the approval of the three powers is ex
pected to smooth c-ut matters among
the officials and go a long way with
adjusting the entire matter.
In reaching this conclusion the of
ficials .of the three powers have decided
not to'attempt a settlement of the Sa
irioa kingship for the present. That is
left open for adjustment when each of
the three powers have had an opportu
nity to present full Information, in the
meantime the statu quo is to be main
tained. The last advices indicated that
Mataafa was exercising de facto king
ship, while Malietoa was on board the
British ship Porpoise and has the sup
port of the British and American Con
suls. According to the understanding
reached there will be no move to per
manently establish one or the other of
these claimants on the throne. The best
wishes of the Samoan people will be
consulted, and with a more agreeable
feeling among the officials of the three
powers the kingship will be settled by
a full conference as soon as all informa
tion on the subject is obtained.
The consequences leading up to the
present understanding developed that
Dr. Kaffel was recalled from his post at
Samoa last November, but he persisted
in staying after his recall, and his pres
ence appears to have had much to do
With precipitating the trouble.
Dr. Solf Is described as an accom
plished diplomat, with service in Cal
cutta and more recently as District
Judge of the German colony at Dar-a-
Saam, in South Africa. It is a post
much similar to that of Judge Cham
ii Samoa.

Lord of the Admiralty or the Govern

First Lord of the Admiralty, he de
clared, deliberately based his policy
upon the accepted principle that Great
Britain's navy should be equal to that
of any other power.
The House rejected the proposition
for the reduction in the budget.
In many ways is an improvement unon the
present law, and while it does not answer all
purposes required, and has some features which
are objectionable, yet in view of the necessity
for further legislation and the fact that the
bill grants much of needed relief, and also in
view of thf fact that any attempt to improve
the same at this time would probably prevent
Its paimagf. now. therefore, be It
Resolved, By the Council of the city of Los

body that member* of the legislature from
Los Angeles County use every effort to secure
the final passage of the above bill, and that

THE REICHSTAG MAY
NOW BE DISSOLVED
BERLIN, March 13.â The opinions ex
pressed in Reichstag circles that the con
flict arising from the differences exist
ing between the Government and the
budget committee regarding the military
bill are more serious than at first
thought. The Emperor insists upon the
full amount asked for.
The Imperial Chancellor, Prince Ho
henlohe, conferred confidentially this af
ternoon with Dr. Lieber, the Centrist
leader, lurging that the Center should
yield. Dr. Lieber replied that this was
impossible, as it would destroy the Cen
ter's influence with the electors.
A number of the leading members of the
Reichstag of all parties to-night are of
the opinion that the Reichstag to-morrow
will vote the budget committee's report
by about 200 against IGS, and they believe
a dissolution will follow. The Center,
however, does not believe there will be a
dissolution, but thinks it is a mere "bluff"
on the part of the Government.
The plans of Cecil Rhodes, the British
South African magnate, who is in this
city with a view of pressing on the
German Government the advisability of
building the Cape Town Railroad, which
will pass through a portion of German
African territory, will be submitted to
colonial experts, on whose report the Gov
ernment will act.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1899, .
NEW YORK, March 13.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: Washington
Is awaiting with some anxiety the
reply which China will make to
the Italian demand for the release of
San Mun Bay.
I was informed at the State Depart
ment this afternoon that the depart
ment's information confirms trie dis
patches (ff the submission of the re
quest by Italy for the lease of San Mun;
of the refusal of the request by the
Chinese Government; of the withdraw
al of the request by the Italian Minister
and the substitution for it of a demand
practically in the nature of an ulti
matum. The time limit in which the
reply must be made does not expire be
fore Wednesday, and the authorities do
not doubt that China is endeavoring
to obtain support from European pow
ers with a view to the rejection of the
demand.
Information which I obtained from
an authentic source would seem to show
that Italy proposes to establish a large
trade with China, and incidentally indi
cates the nation from which she is re
ceiving support. About a year ago an
attache of the Italian legation in Pe
king, who associated himself with
prominent Englishmen, applied to the
Governor of the province of Kiangsi for
a concession under which he would get
possession of all mining privileges in
that province. The Governor gave the
concession, but such a storm of indig
nation was aroused in the province by
his action that the matter came to the
attention of the imperial government,
and it was urged to disapprove the
Governor's action by people who united
in a petition to the Emperor.
The Tsung Li Yamen endeavored to
revoke the concession, but such pres
sure was brought to bear by the Italian
and British Ministers that it was forced
to approve it with a few slight modifi
cations, which did not affect its value.
The province abounds in iron and coal
fields, and the concession is extremely
valuable.
An Italian-English syndicate has
been organized to work the concession.
Kiangsi province is adjacent to the
province of Chekiang, in which San
Mun is located. It is proposed by the
Italian Government to obtain a sphere
of influence around San Mun, through
which it will be able to run a railroad
connecting the port with the province
of Kiangsi.
It is apparent to officials, therefore,
that Great Britain is interested in hav
ing the Italian demand granted. Some
of the English members of the syndi
cate are understood to be members of
the House of Lords and of the House
of Commons, and they have doubtless
exerted their influence upon the Salis
bury government in behalf of Italy. It
has developed that Russia and Japan
have never supported Italy in any way,
the Tokio Government having been, on
the other hand, opposed to it, while
Russia has remained passive. "What
course Russia will now pursue in view
of the efforts of Italy to obtain a lease
will naturally have an important effect
upon China's policy.

ALVISO APPROPRIATION
CAUSES REJOICING
SAN JOSE, March 13.â A Jollification
meeting was held at Hale's Hall this
evening to celebrate the securing of a
$48,000 appropriation by Congress for the
improving of Alviso Channel. There was
a fair attendance. Vice President C. M.
Hatcher of the Board of Trade presided.
Addresses were delivered by District At
torney J. H. Campbell, D. W. Burchard,
Robert Summers, A. T. Herrman and
others.
The improvement of Alviso, the speak
ers declared, meant much for San Jose
and Santa Clara County. This waterway
had already been the means of reducing
freight rates, and the deepening and
widening of it would prove more benefi
cial. The completion of Santa Margarita
Gap was referred to. With this done, Al
viso Improved, and the coming of the
Santa Pie, a new era was predicted for
this section.
Resolutions thanking Senators White
and Perkins for working for the Alviso
improvement were unanimously adopted.
The chair was empowered to appoint a
committee of five to see there 1b no un
necessary delay.
SMALLPOX EPIDEMIC
NOW UNDER CONTROL
LOS ANGELES, March 13.â The follow
ing official statement in regard to the
smallpox situation in Los Angeles was Is
sued to-day by the Board of Health:
Grossly exaggerated reports have recently
been published to the effect that smallpox has
become dangerously prevalent in Los Angeles,
while the facts are to the contrary. Since the
appearance of the disease, in September last,
there have been altogether eeventy-six cases,
the greater number occurring in the latter part
of January and the first part of February.
At the present time there are fourteen cases,
eight of them In the hospital and six under
quarantine in private residences. In addition
there are thirty-three persons under quarantine
as convalescents, most of whom are now well
and will soon be discharged. The precautions
taken l>y the Board of Health to prevent the
spread of the disease have proved most success
ful, and the number of new cases each week Is
now lees than the number of those discharged.
There is no reason to apprehend that small
pox will become epidemic in Los Angeles, and
there Is no occasion for alarm among residents
or visitors to the city. FRED EATON,
Mayor of Los Angreles and President of the
Board of Health.

HITS A REEF ON
MEDWAY ISLAND
The Steamer Dirlgo a
Wreck.
STRIKES DURING A STORM
BLINDING SNOW OBSCURES HER
COUESE.
The Crew and Forty Alaska-Bound
Passengers Picked Up
by the Cottage
City.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, March 13.â News
was brought by the steamer Cottage
! City, which arrived this evening from
Alaskan ports, that the steamer Dirlgo,
Captain George Roberts, owned by the
Washington and Alaska Steamship
Company, has been wrecked. She ran
onto a reef on Medway Island, which
lies in Stevenson Channel, Clarence
Straits, and about forty miles below
Juneau, during a blinding snowstorm
on the night of Thursday last. Captain
Roberts and the pilot were both on the
bridge. They were unable to see the
length of their arms in front of them
owing to the thickly falling snow. The
captain was, as is the custom of the
Alaska steamboatmen in such cases,
tooting his whistle and listening for
the echoes to shape his course.
The steamer was proceeding cau
tiously along, feeling her way under a
slow bell, when there came a crash
which caused the two mariners to stag
ger and awakened the sleeping passen
gers. After the first crash the steamer
slewed around and then struck heavily
on the reef with her beam, throwing
some of the half-awakened passengers
from their berths. Two other blows
sounded In quick succession, and then
the steamer remained hard and fast in
a cradle of rocks as if she was in a
vise.
The passengers â there were about
forty northbound men on board â
crowded to the deck, and great excite
ment prevailed, for none knew but that
the wrecked vessel would founder
within a few minutes. Some of the
more terror-stricken men rushed to the
boats, and would have cut them away
but for the firm stand taken by the
officers of the steamer. They quieted
the excited passengers, and, with the
assurance that there was no immediate
danger, got them to stand by the ship
until morning.
When morning came the snow con
tinued to fall, but the wrecked pilgrims
were able to see land looming out
through it at no great distance. The
majority of them then took to the boats
and landed on Medway Island. They
took some supplies aboard and with
tarpaulin covers for tents they camped
there for forty-eight hours. Then re
lief came. The Cottage City's lights
â were seen on Saturday night, and
those who still remained with the
wreck â tfie captain, his crew and some
of the passengers who had refused to
leave the steamer â blew again and
again shrill distress signals. The Cot
tage City was not slow in responding,
and soon the contingent camped on the
island and all those who wished to
leave the steamer were on board and
bound south to Wrangel.
The purser and a few of the crew re
mained with the wreck and Captain
Roberts and the passengers took pass
age to Wrangel by the Cottage City.
Captain Roberts Is a very sick man, he
having succumbed to the grip soon
after his vessel was wrecked. He is
being attended at Wrangel.
It is thought by tho officers of the
Cottage City that the Dirigo will prove
a total wreck. She is badly torn and !
fast in a cradle of rocks.
Captain Roberts of the Dirigo was
formerly master and part owner of the
City of Seattle. He was on the Willapa
when she was wrecked in northern
waters.
No lives were lost, nor, as far as could
be learned, was any one injured in the
Dirigo disaster.

the demonstration.
TAKES HAWAIIAN LAND.
WASHINGTON, March 13.â After ma
ture consideration of the subject the War
Department has decided to take advan
tage of the provision of the act by which
Hawaii was annexed to the United States,
transferring' the public lands to the gen
eral Government, to acquire such tracts
in the islands as may be necessary for
military purposes. To this end an of
ficer will be send to Honolulu and will
begin the work by taking possession in
the name of the "War Department of a
considerable tract near the capital. The
Navy Department has bf-on forehanded in
this particular, having- through the work

of some fine water front property within
a short time after the annexation resolu
tion was adopted.
STRUCK BY A TRAIN.
SAN BERNARDINO, March 13.â Mrs.

TO BE LIBRARIAN
OF CONGRESS
WASHINGTON, March 13.â The
President has appointed Herbert Put
nam of Boston to be librarian of Con
gress.
BOSTON, March 13.â Herbert Put
nam was born in New York city in 1861.
He is the son of George H. Putnam,
founder of the publishing house of
George Putnam & Sons. Mr. Putnam
w#s graduated from Harvard in 1883
and attended the Columbia law school
for one year thereafter. In the fall of
1884 he went to Minneapolis and a year
later entered the Minnesota bar.
In 1884, however, he took the librar
ianship in the Minneapolis Athenaeum.
He organized the Minneapolis Public
Library, a free city institution, with a
circulating department, branches and
delivery stations. The old Athenaeum
came into the new library, making its
booka free to the public, the city pay
ing the expenses of administering them.
The aggregate income of the joint
libraries has been from $50,000 to $75,000
per annum.
During the construction of the build
ing Mr. Putnam was engaged in the
purchase of books, going abroad for the
purpose, and at the end of the first
seven years of his administration he
.had added some 50,000 volumes to the
12,000 originally possessed by the Athe
naeum.
In December, 1891, Mr. Putnam, for
personal reasons, resigned his position
and'came to Boston, where he practiced
law. In February, 1895, he was chosen
APPOINTS UNION
BANK DIRECTORS
Judge Lorigan Names a
Full Board.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 12.â The first step
toward straightening the financial en
tanglement surrounding the failure of j
the Union Savings Bank was taken this
morning by Judge Lorigan in the ap
pointment of a new board of directors.
Cyrus Jones, Amasa Eaton, James W.
Rea, Louis Callisch, Peter H. Stock,
Dr. William Simpson and George T.
Dunlop were named as directors to
close the bank's business and try to
pay the depositors dollar for dollar, j
The Wrights, whose mismanagement
brought on the failure, were ignored, j
and in this respect the wish of the de- |
positors was carried out.
The new board contains four of the j
men recommended for directors by the
Stockholders and who tendered their
resignations to the court a few days ;
ago. President W. H. Wright, C. P.
Breslan and Nicholas Bowden were not
reappointed. There were strong objec
tions to Wright and Breslan, but none
to Bowden, but the fact that Bowden i
was a lawyer worked against him.
Ureslan was elected a director after the
failure and refused to resign when the
others did. Breslan has decided to
fight to retain his seat, and as he rep
resents large San Francisco holdings
in the bank the case will be stubbornly
contested in the courts.
Judge Lorigan said he had purposely
omitted naming any of the old direct
ors, who were in a way responsible for
the failure, and likewise would name
none who were interested in any per
sonal way in the securities of the bank, i
He named George T. Dunlop of Gilroy
as a representative of the stockholders
of that section. Dunlop was not a
stockholder, but he would qualify at
once.
The Howard creditors met this after
noon and elected C. H. Bills, the fruit
shipper, as trustee of the bankrupt's
estate. Persons representing claims ag
gregating $450,000 were present. Of this
amount $305,656 was represented by the
Union Savings Bank. Over $5525,000 oj
this sum will be protested, as Howard
claims the bank wiped out this much
of the indebtedness eighteen months
ago rather than have him fail at that
time. Bills' bond was placed at $50,000.
It is expected Howard will be ex
amined in a few days, as the officials
of the bank have intimated he is hiding
some of the assets.
It is now given out that Frank V.
Wright, a brother of the banker's, must
resign soon from the secretaryship of
the San Jose Building and Loan Asso
ciation or be ousted. At the annual elec
tion held a few days after the bank
failure he was re-elected secretary, the
office of assistant secretary created,
and A. K. Whitton given the place.
Wright was elected for three months
only. He agreed to serve without pay
and at the end of that time resign.
This was an easy way of letting him
out There was nothing wrong with
him as secretary, but a man like Whit
ton was needed to strengthen and re
store confidence in the association after
the failure of the bank.
The bank directors met this afternoon
and elected James W. Rea president
and Peter H. Stock vice president. Paul
P Austin was elected manager and
Edward Rea and Jackson Hatch attor
neys The attorneys will receive $250
a month between them. No salary has
been fixed for the manager. Directors
Callisch, Eaton and Jones were not
present and they admit Rea outwitted
them and secured all the fat positions
for his friends. Some of the stockhold
ers are not satisfied with the election
of officers, but they have no alternative.
President Rea said this evening he
was going to investigate the bank af
fairs thoroughly and if the toÂ»uiutÂ»u]
had been looted he intended to land the
thieves in San Quentln. The closing up
of the business would be conducted
economically and the directors and of
ficers would receive no pay. He wanted
to know if he and his father had been
robbed and if so who did it. "they
had been robbed the thieves would be
punished.
Charles P. Braslan says that to-mor
row he will file in the Supreme Court
of California a petition for a writ o-f
certiorari to revise the action of Judge
Lorigan in appointing the new board of
directors. _______________

RUM'S ENEMIES
IN BATTLE LINE
Besiege the Los Angeles
Council.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 13.â The
rhurch people are up in arms against
I the proposed repeal of the existing or
: dinance and the substitution of one
! that will give greater liberty to retail
I liquor dealers. The Council to-day
listened to the reading of a number of
protests against the proposed change.
One document bore the names of 1500
persons; others were from preachers
; alone and others represented the con
i gregations of various churches. The
| protests usually set forth that,
, "Whereas, The Mayor of our fair city
. has expressed himself in favor of per
! mittlng Sunday saloon traffic by the
' payment of additional license, we re
! spectfully enter this, our remon
i strance."
Rev. Burt Estes Howard, pastor of
I the Church of the Covenant, makes
i some variation by presenting a docu
| ment, original with himself, express
; ing the sentiment of his congregation,
i though no other names are appended.
! This memorial declares open saloons
: are favorable to crime, and prays that
! the Council pass an ordinance that will
i not only close saloons at midnight and
; all day -Sunday, but will close side and
i rear doors, remove private boxes and
compel drugstores and soda fountain
men to cease the retail sale of liquor.
Other protests were from the First
Baptist Church, the University Church,
the Second United Presbyterian, the
United Presbyterian, Bethesda Pres
j byterian, Knox Presbyterian and the
] American Baptist. One signed by
I twenty-one Presbyterian ministers
* came from the Women's Christian
Temperance Union through President
Ada R. Hand and Secretary Mary C.
Tampson. The protest of Haven M. E.
Church bore the names of sixty-four
members.
When the protests had all been read
President Silver announced tnat the
matter was in the hands of the Finance
Committee, and nothing would be done
at this time. A public hearing will be
given next Monday, when all sides will
have an opportunity to be heard.

OAKLAND, March 13.â next city
government of Oakland will be solidly
Republican.
The election held to-day showed that
the Republican majority is more unified
than ever and is even stronger than in
the fall of 1906, when It saved California
to the McKinley column. For the next
two years Oakland will have a Republi
can Board of Works, and as this board
can do as it pleases with the immense pa
tronage of the police, street and lire de
partments, there is no doubt that there
will be a thorough reorganization of them,
especially as many members have been
openly lighting the Republican ticket dur
ing the past month.
As stated in The Call the week after
the Republican convention, an effort was
to be made to deliver the city into the
hands of those who would run it "wide
open." The warning was. heeded and the
personnel of the government elected to
day is deserving of the utmost confidence.
It was a straight party fight, and al
though the support of the Municipal
League helped to produce the agreeable
result, it is noticeable that the only can
didate of the league on the general ticket,
D. C. Hinsdale for Auditor, was hopeless
ly beaten. â
The candidates elected are ; all well
known and are Republicans of good
standing in the community. They have
been so frequently referred to in these
columns and their claims to office so
often set forth that their election Is no

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1899.
HE CRUISER
CHITOSE LAID
UP FOR REPAIRS
Machinery Damaged
by the Crew.
SOMEBODY MADE BLUNDERS
HER DEPARTURE WILL BE LONG
DELAYED.
Working Night and Day to Get the
Hongkong Maru Ready for
Sea â Gatherer Goes On
Anita Rock.
The Japanese may have made a success
of handling warships and merchantmen
in other parts of the world, but they cer
tainly have not done so here, if success Is
to be measured by their handling of ves
sels now in port. Mechanics are working
night and day to get the Hongkong Maru
ready to resume her maiden voyage on
Friday next and it will be a month before
the cruiser Chitose will be able to leave
her moorings. One or two of her furnaces
are down, her engine for the steam steer
ing gear is disabled, one of the winches is
smashed to atoms and the donkey engine
is out of kilter.
The cruiser waa to have been open to
the public last Sunday, but owing to these
mishaps visitors were not allowed aboard.
Those who went out to her on launches
were turned away and had to be content
with a visit to the battleship lowa instead.
After being tested in every conceivable
way the Chitose was finally accepted by
the Japanese Government. She made more
than the required number of knots on her
trial and after her final spin, in order to
work up the necessary revolutions, waa
pronounced one of the greatest successes
ever turned out by the Union Iron Works.
While the cruiser was undergoing her
trials her crew arrived here from Japan.
The sailors, firemen, oilers, machinists
and engineers upon reaching the city were
taken out to the iron works and housed
there until the warship was accepted. All
the necessary tests were completed about
ten days ago and then the mechanics of
the iron works retired and the crew
brought out from Yokohama took charge.
Things did not run smoothly, however,
and the Union Iron Works men are now
aboard the Chitose again repairing dam-
i ages.
Out at the warship everybody is retl
! cent. It appears, however, that low water
in the boilers was the cause of the fur
naces coming down, and the damage to
I the steam-steering engine was caused by
i a man who "wanted to see the wheels go
I round." No one seems to know how the
winch was smashed and no one will tell
what is the matter with the donkey en
gine; but everybody knows that it will be
\ several weeks before the cruiser is ready
for sea.
The trouble on the Hongkong Maru is
entirely the fault of the English builders.
The Scotts turned the warship over in
perfect condition, but the people who
built the merchantman didn't follow suit.
The boilers were made In a hurry and in
consequence would not stand the strain.
! Between Yokohama and Honolulu they
i began to leak around the furnace crowns
and gradually went from bad to worse
until when San Francisco was reached
every one of the twenty-seven crowns was
leaking. In order to make the neces
j sary repairs all the rivets had to be cut
! out" the sheets fitted closely together and
f reriveted. In order to get the Job done
: before the day of sailing, men have been
at work since the vessel came in without
a moment's rest. As soon as one man got
tired another took his place. When one
prang went to lunch or supper another
! pang took up the work and in this way
the Hongkong Maru's boilers will be put
In first-class order by Friday and the
steamer will go out on schedule time.
The torpedo boat Fox, built at Portland
for the Government, arrived here yester
day. She made the run from Astoria
here In forty-five hours, but at no time
was going full speed. She did not
come to an anchor on her arrival, but
went direct to Mare Island. She will be
turned over to the Government in a day
or two.
The barkentine Gatherer went on Anita
rock, off the Presidio, when making port
yesterday afternoon. She was coming in
with a twelve-knot breeze and off the
Presidio Captain Stokkoley decided to
anchor. Unfortunately, both of the an
chor chains fouled, and before they could
| be cleared the vessel was on the rock.
The tug Reliance went to her assistance,
! but the captain refused the proffered aid.
I The Gatherer is coal laden, and the cap
procinct was there any disturbance. Ow
ing to the fact that there were twice the
usual number of polling places, the re
turns were completed quite early. It was
seen from the iirst that Snow was in the
lead but not until the count was half
through was it certain that City Attor
ney Dow and Clement were elected.
When complete returns were received
from the precincts the gains for the Re
publican ticket increased steadily.
R W Snow, the Mayor-elect, is the
best known official in Oakland The May
hew family, from which Mr. Snow Is de-
Sded settled Marthas Vineyard in the
year 1640, after purchasing the island
from Lord Sterling. Governor Mayhew,
his son and grandsons were preachers to
the Indians and white settlers for five
generations. When Mr. Snow was four
years old he was adopted by Joehua
Snow, a ship master and his early edu
cation was received In the public schools
of Edgartown. At the age of 18 he moved
to Chicago, where he spent the following
seven years, and then came to Oakland in
1875 He engaged in business in San Fran
cisco, although still residing on this side
of the bay, until ISB9, when by the new
charter the office of Auditor was created
in Oakland, and Mr. Snow was elected
to fill it after being indorsed by a citi
zens' convention. He has since been in
dorsed by nearly all the local political
parties and is now serving his fourth
term as Auditor.
The Sixth and Fifth Wards set their
teal of disapproval upon men who prove
unfaithful to their constituents in the
fixing of water rates. W. Watkinson and
X W Woodward, the only members of
the "solid six" who sought re-election,
were buried out of sight. Woodward re
ceived 60 votes out of nearly 1000 in his
ward, and Watkinson did not fare much
A scurrilous circular issued In the Sec
ond W T ard for the purpose of trying to in
jure Councilman Gfrard seems to have had
the opposite effect, for Mr. Girard was re
turned to the Council by a handsome ma
jority.

One of the boldest burglaries committed
In this city In some time was reported at
Police Headquarters last night by a rep

Market street. While the amount stolen
was not large, the cheekiness of the
crime and its execution has led the de
partment to believe that a band of daring
crooks has invaded the city. The rob
bery was well planned and carried out.
How the burglars escaped detection has
created great surprise, as the crime was

too strong for the little boat, so the com
modore had to heave to. The Mabelle
drifted all night, and early yesterday
morning the half-drowned trio found
themselves off Santa Cruz harbor. Ihe
little vessel was sailed into the bay, and
as soon as the mudhook was fast Lee

his companion's shoulders and with a
knife cut a hole in the wire screen inside
the transom. While one kept a sharp
lookout for policemen, the other entered
the restaurant and coolly tapped the cash

Luckily for the proprietor, the Satur

for the thief to carry away with him.
In his search for more coin the burglar

dropped various sums. His haul was
more remunerative, as some generous
Christian had dropped a twenty-dollar

HAS NO JURISDICTION.
Railroad Commission Is Unable to
Fix Pullman Car Rates.
The State Board of Railroad Commis

missioners Laumelster and Edson being j
present. Commissioner Blackstock had j
been called out of the city. After a short â 
discussion the Commissioners decided to j
dismiss the proceedings Instituted some
time ago to Investigate and regulate the
rates of the Pullman Palace Car Com
pany in this State. Attorney General
Tlrey L. Ford, who had been asked for
an opinion in regard to the jurisdiction of
the board, informed the Commissioners
that they have no power under existing
statutes to inquire into the affairs of the
Pullman Company. Acting on this ad
vice the board abandoned the proceedings.
Nothing was done In the grain rates

Commissioner Blackstock has not com
pleted his report on the subject. The re
port is expected next week.
TRADES UNION BOOM.
Applications for Membership in the
Carpenters' Unions.
The carpenters' unions of this city have
reopened their charters and are now tak
ing in members at a reduced rate. This
action has had the effect of piling the
desks of the secretaries with applications
for membership. Union No. 483 met last
night, and eighteen new members took
the obligations. After the business meet
ing the regular quarterly high Jinks was
held. A collation as served, after which
cigars and liquid refreshments were
passed around and the members and
guests proceeded to make merry.
P. J. McKenna, president of the union,
acted as master of ceremonies. Enthu
siastic speeches were made by E. L.
Malsbary, Harry M. Saunders, Guy Lath
rop, H. Myers, P. H. McCarthy and many
others. In the course of his speech Mr.
Saunders incidentally mentioned the fact
that he had seventeen applications for
membership in his pocket, which called
forth a storm of applause.
After the regular speech-making "stag"
songs and stories were the order of the
evening, and the gathering broke up at a
late hour.
EXAMINATION
OF TEACHERS
IS POSTPONED
The Board Fixes June
24 as the Date.
HEAD AND WEBSTER DIFFER
ABUSES IN ISSUANCE OF
SPECIAL CERTIFICATES.
Instructors in Special Lines Must
Procure Licenses From the
Board of Examiners in
Order to Teach.
The Board of Education held a special
meeting last evening and extended the
date for the semi-annual examination of
teachers from March 24 to June 24. At
the last regular meeting of the board a
resolution was introduced which provided
that all teachers In the department who
are holding regular certificates and
teaching special subjects should appear
for examintation on March 24 and secure
a special certificate permitting them to
instruct classes in special subjects.
President Bergerot, at the request of Di
rectors Eells, Brandenstein and Stow,
called a special session of the board to
consider this resolution. During the two
hours' debate the subject of special
teachers was gone into in detail, and
Superintendent Webster and Director
Head became somewhat acrimonious in
exchanging their views.
When the resolution was taken up Di
rector Head offered an amendment ex
tending the date on which the board of
examiners shall meet to examine appli
cants for teachers' certificates. He de
sired the extension, he said, as a matter
of justice to a number of teachers who
have been teaching special branches. It
looked like taking snap judgment to or
der an immediate examination when some
of the department employes might be
rusty.
President Bergerot called attention to
i the sections of the Political Code gov
i ernlng the actions of city school boards,
! and said the signing of warrants for sal
aries where the teacher did not hold a cer
tificate to teach a special branch was
illegal, and each member of the board
could be legally held responsible for mon
ey thus illegaily paid out.
The members of the board were satis
fied that a teacher's regular certificate
was good only for branches of study
enumerated in section 1G65 of the Politi
cal Code, and that instructors in other
lines must hold special certificates.
Superintendent Webster emphatically
and vigorously opposed an extension of
the date on which examinations are to
be held. He maintained that any teacher
in the department who could not at
any time pass a satisfactory and rea
sonable examination in fils or her par-
I ticular branch 1b not qualified to teach
i and should be discharged. He said it had
been the practice of preceding boards to
order special certificates Issued for per
sons who were Incompetent and then
placing these persons on fhe payroll. He
stated further that he had made a par
tial examination of certificates on file and
! had found glaring and vicious abuses.
This he had stopped by refusing to per
i mit any special examinations. The Su
! perintendent criticized Director Head's
i position, and made some caustic remarks
which the latter resented. Mr. Head de
clared that the Superintendent had signed
warrants for these special teachers al
luded to. and, according to his own con
tention, his acts in doing so were illlegal.
I The Director thought it very strange if
the Superintendent knew of these abuses
that he had not informed fhe board long
I before.
Other members of the board partici
j pated in the discussion, and as their re
! marks Indicated they were in favor of ex
tending the date for examination, the
Superintendent bowed to their wishes.
He. contended, however, before the vote
was taken that the law requiring semi
annual examinations is explicit, and as

special certificates: All languages other

are all special lines and are not enum

Mrs. Louise Wenther, 1186 Kentucky
street, swore to a complaint In Judge
Conlan's court yesterday for the arrest
of "John Doe" Miller on a charge of
felony embezzlement. Mrs. "Wenther al
leges that March 4 she gave Miller a gold
watch to repair, which was worth $80, and
since then she has not seen nor heard of
him. Miller canvassed houses for watches
or jewelry to repair, and it is said that
Mrs. Wenther is not the only one anxious
to hear about him.

NEW YORK, STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 13.â The market gener
Â»Uy worked fractionally lower to-day for the
railway list, with most activity in the spe
cialties, which, on the whole, were well sup
ported. Tobacco was a feature with a rise of
Six points net. American Steel and Wire and
the American Steel shares generally were con
fc-pl.-jvusly strong in the forenoon, but later
lost grounJ.
American Steel and WlrÂ« preferred went up
S points in anticipation of a dividend, which
subsequently developed, and the stock eased
off on realizations. Metropolitan Street Rall
wf.y Bhowed alternate strength and weak
ness, while Third Avenue was decidedly fever
ish, and they ended with a loss of 14 each.
Talk of rate cutting amon; the local gas com-
panic* brought liquidation In Consolidated Gas, \
'which ended with a loss of 3 points. Among i
the usually inactive stocks there was a Jump |
Of 5 points In Flint and Pere Marquette.
while Great Northern preferred rose 5%. half I
of which It subsequently lost. Strength among
all the Southwestern railroads and Southern j
Railway preferred got up 2 points, losing half !
of It. There was comparatively little doing ,
among the anthracite coalers, and Lackawanna
i and the Reading seconds were materially
â  higher while the rest were fractionally up. The
general railway list was irregular and with :
the rest of the market eased on the bidding i
of call money to 4 per cent in the last hour. i
The rate for call money, however, eased oft !
an' closed -Wai per cent, but the market
meed weak. Advices from the interior re
ported a plethora of money in various sections.
In some cases attributable to sums received
for industrial concerns taken into the larger
combinations. Over a million dollars in gold
was received from California too late to figure
-In last week's bank statement. London's tran
sactions were in small volume, purchases ap
parently slightly exceeding sales.
" While the aggregate of to-day's bond trad- !
Ing was considerably below recent totals, I
there was no abatement of the confident tone j
to operations, and some issues achieved record i
prices. Texas Pacific seconds were In brisk \
demand, rising to 04, but sagged later. Total i
eales, 11800.000.
United States old 4s and the 5s advanced

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 13.â Commercial
Advertiser's London financial cablegram Bays:
The market was generally stagnant to-day, be
cause of the long account and the approaching
Easter holidays. Americans were hardly men
tioned and were confined to fractional move
ments. London has made its mind up for an
Idle period. Spanish fours were 58%, but Paris.
Gold them heavily and they closed at 55%.
Coppers were weak on the fall in metal of
30s.
Anacondas were 31 13-16. Tlntos were 39%;
Utahs, 9; Boston, 21 5-16.
An African gold arrival of Â£320,000 was taken

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March â The early news con
i nected with wheat taken altogether was ever
i changing to the bulls and at the start the
market recovered somewhat from the extreme
' despondency it evinced Saturday. A better
j feeling was imparted by steady foreign mar-
I kets and the small world's shipments last
I â¢week. The exports from this country com
i prised about 65 per cent of the total, while
| Russia and the Danubian countries combined
j furnished only about 15 per cent. May opened
%@%c higher at from 63V4c up to 6y%@6'j i sic,
but the demand at the improvement was not
i urgent. Scattered selling by commission houses
i forced the price off to 69% c. At that point,
, however, the selling pressure slackened and an
upward tendency set in. The principal feature
of the day's news was the crop damage re
! ports. They came from all directions and made
! much more positive claims of winter killing
i than previous advices. Near the close the re
ported damage to the Indian wheat crop
by drought and the steadiness of European
! markets caused this market to rule firm to
! the end. From 69% c for May, the price grad-
I ually rose to 70 I / Â»c, when a slight reaction set
i in on profit-taking and May closed at 6j~,i'<ilitc.
Corn gained a little in sympathy with wheat

; buying orders from the country. One of the
heaviest local shorts was the ljrincipal buyer.
' Liquidation of long corn seemed to have run
its course. May closed %c higher. Oats were
firm in sympathy with the other grains. There
was a good scattered demand tor May, but
July was more or less neglected. The cash
demand from the East was good, but holders
I here were not inclined to sell at current prices.
May closed VaVzC advance. Provisions ruled
steady, with packers moderate buyers against
cash sales. Shipments of meats were moder
ate. May pork left off 2%c higher, lard and
ribs 2%c lower.

CALIFORNIA ORANGES IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, March 13.â Journal of Com
merce says: Recent abnormal weather condi
tions throughout the orange growing section
of the South have caused handlers and receiv
ers of this fruit to investigate the situation
carefully In order to determine if possible the
probabilities of next season's crop. It was
thought that the trees had recovered sufficient
ly from the damage done in 1896 to be an im
portant factor in the market, but the freezing
weather of a few weeks ago blighted these
hopes, and present conditions are unfavorable
for a realization of this expectation. A prom
inent receiver, when questioned with regard to
the orange situation, said:
"The present position of the orange market
is a very strange one. The fact of the matter
is that the only available fruit is from Cali
fornia. Last week sixty-eight carloads were
auctioned here at higher prices than have been
obtained so far this season. All the best navels
of desirable sizes brought from $3 75 to $4 per
box, while smaller sizes of the best fruit sold
at $3 25 to 53 50. There have been no arrivals
of Valencia oranges for several weeks, but the
small quantity lately sold has come from the
storehouses. It is also learned that there Is
none on the way from England, as pricee in
that country equal a cost of over $5 per case
of regular sizes. The market for this fruit at
present is from {> 25 to $4 50 per box. Valencia
fruit is not to be compared with California,
and Is not as a rule taken by the same class of
buyers. Owing to the advance in the market
some shipments have been made from the Medi
terranean, and it ie reported that 15,000 boxes
are at present on their way to New York and
Boston from Sicily, with doubtless more to fol
low.
"As far as Florida oranges are concerned, It
Is useless to expect any more fruit of -conse
quence this season, the late freezing weather
having ruined the fruit with the exception of
the extreme southern portion of the State.
There has been some damage to young trees,
but zero weather did not ruin them absolutely.
Notwithstanding higher prices for California
fruit, it would seem they must necessarily go
higher, owing to the exaggerated Ideas of the
owners of the remaining fruit on the coast,
where they are at present asking $3 per box f.
o. b. in carload lots for navels and $1 75 for
Mediterranean sweets. It is necessary to add
$1 per box for freight and selling expenses, and
when it is remembered that there is a variety
of sizes, some desirable and some otherwise,
these prices are above those ruling here. How
ever, it is simply a question of supply and de
-1 mand, and from all appearances the former is
decidedly small."

The advance in Hay continues and another

strength of the market is shown by the sale
of a car of Oregon wheat at $16 50. The market
has now got up so high that Increased . re
ceipts of this outside Hay are expected. What
effect they will have remains to be seen. But
dealers do not expect any decline at present
unless it rains, for supplies are very short and
it is not thought that Oregon has enough to
spare to break this market. If the dry weather
continues there, will probably be lively times
ahead, as the California crop Is not looking as

In th<- Sierra Neva. la mine the northwest
drift on tin 1 140-foot level has been extended
flaring the week 40 feet; total length 205 feet.
The face is in porphyry, cUiy and (juartz. In
the Union shaft workings of the Sierra Nevada
the south drift from the top of the upraise, 80
feet above this level, has been advanced 10 feet
during the week; total length 103 feet. The
in porphyry and clay.
The report of the work In the Consolidated
California and Virginia mine during the week |
is as follows; 1400 levelâ The drift has been
cleaned out, retim'oered and track laid for 96
feet, or a total distance of 360 feet. At this
point they struck the Junction of the north- i
west and southwest drifts. Both are in bad j
condition. It Is Intended to follow the north
west drift for about 3SO feet to a point where I
it intersects a north and south drift running In
the old Hopes. 1650 levelâ On March 4 the bulk- |
head that was built on December 23. 189S, was I
removed from the drift and the level care- \
fully examined, but little gas was found on j
the level or in the connecting drifts to the '
Ophlr shaft. The fire that occurred on Decem
ber 23 was at n point lust above the 1750 level
in the Btopes. Since opening the 1650 level they i
have been able to lay pipes and carry hose i
to points In the old Btopea between the 1650
and 1730 levels, and are now turning all the
Burface Water that was caught up on the 1650 i
level and conveyed to the Sutro tunnel Into the
old Btopes in the neighborhood of the fire that. ]
â is near as can be ascertained, was smothered !
by the bulkheads put In on the 1600 and 17f>0 '
levels In December last. They expect shortly j
to be able to open the bulkheads on the 1730-foot ]
!â¢ 1 el. i>n the 1750-foot level the station has
be.'n finished and 150 feet of the drift repaired
and retimbered where required* Tracks have
been laid and the drift put in working order.
as they wish to get at and use the winze that
extends down Into the etopea from this level.
Work on the electric installation has been con
tlnued, nnd a little work has been done In the
shafl and in strengthening weak places in the j
several stations.
In t'e Hale an! Norcross mine they are c!ean- !
Ing out and repairing the connecting drift be
tween the main tivline and the Sutro tunnel
south lateral branch.
In the Best and Belcher and Gould and Cur
ry mines at the connection with the Oebistnn :
shaft they have been able to get Into the pump >
compartment at the station and find that some
distance above the shaft timbers have given
way, but until they are able to remove more
of the caved material they can not make a
report as to the exact condition of the shaft.

lie goes fortrt among his fellow men free.
The awful charge of being a dog fighter
r.o longer hangs over him. However, that
he celebrated his triumph by giving a
pijik tea to the other gentlemen who were
with him at the pit, and who have yet to
.strata that they share with him
the benison of an innocence complete and
childlike, is believed to be a canard.
The trial was resumed and finished yes
terday afternoon. It had been announced
to open at 2 p. m. and in Judge Tread
â well's court. This, of course, was suffi
cient reason for its resumption at 2:40 in
the court of Judge Mogan. The apart
ment was filled when Acting Police Judge
Barry called time. On a front seat. was
Chaw, the center of a throng of admiring'
friends. They seemed to hang on the
â words of the great man and to yearn for
his smile. Close to him sat one Riley.
whose ordinary title lacks the refinement
â¢"Chaw" and 13 naturally omitted.
The star performer was Attorney Mack.
He grew reel of countenance at the slight
est provocation, swung: his arms fear-
Eomely, and wouldn't let a witness say a
word" that in the judgment of the lawyer
lor the defense should not be said. .He
winked almost audibly, held up warning
fingers, and if physical contortions failed
to convey his meaning, coached with the
bawling vociferation of a man steering a
base-runner. Occasionally the Judge
mildly sought to check him, and Prose
cuting Attorney Carpenter entered warm
ish protests, but only when he got
through did Mack stop. He articulated
Ireely, except as the aspirant H came !
along. This he dropped so frequently !
that had it been i material instead of
ethereal he would at adjournment have >,
stood at least knee deep in H's.
Perhaps, unconsciously to both, a subtile I
bond ot sympathy existed between the I
court and Chaw's legal defender. Each
would be bald on top were nature per- i
mitted to take its course, and each has
cultivated certain locks to about the
length of a horse's tail, these being deftly
draped aloft and glued. Yet this' is a
trifle, and could have no real bearing on
the issue.
The first witness was Grocer Mehan.
With manifest diffidence he told his name.
His embarrassment was painful when he
had to tell where he lived. He pleaded
that he might "degrade, humiliate or in
riminate" nimself. He pleaded simllarly
rhen' asked whether there was a base
le'hf under his house. At every question j
lack jumped up to object, describing the >
â¢ltness as an accomplice of Casey's. At- ,
torney Carpenter was willing to accept I
his as a plea of guilty, but Mack could j
ot agree, although he still stuck to the
hrase. Possibly Mack will now consider
lat as Chaw's purity, has been ' made
nown to the world an "accomplice"
lust "be equally pure. -, : : â  _-.
Mehan finally did manage to admit that i
c knew where he lived, but that wicked !
icn bent upon the iniquity of dog-fighting
ad designed to sully the integrity of his j
premises he could not be brought to de
clare. He 'thought he knew Casey, al- i
though the hesitancy of his reply was in- :
dicative of doubt, but whether he ..had
leased that basement to Casey or any
body else he declined to say. He thought j
he nad seen men go into the basement
February 19, but did not recognize any
of them. " Had he seen any dogs there? !
No. indeed. â  -.
Carpenter wanted to ask questions de- !
Figned to extract information from the
witness.' but Mack promptly pointed out
tho wanton illegality of every such ques- :
tion and the court sustained the objec- j
tion, h's ruling being in effect that a wit
ness had a right to decide for himself j
whether or not to reply. Thereupon Car- ,
penter took off his glasses for the four
hundred- and fifth time and made foren
elc ado over Mack's verbal Instructions to
the witness. If Mack felt momentarily
lepressed he came back like a released
spring a second later. { '~j '
When Mehan left the stand there had
-teec-n' yielded toy him as much detail con
cerning Casey and the unfought" light as
by hydraulic pressure there might have i
been "squeezed blood from a turnip.
The-fc-econd- witness was a smooth-faced
boy named McVicker. Of course he could
r.ot expect - to place upon reticence the
value ascribed to it by the older and
wiser Mehan, but with cultivation he will
reach the Mehan standard after a while.
Nobody' accused the lad of lying, for be
sides a feeling or kindness toward the err
ing young McVicker is a husky boy. He
would no; say a word to in any manner
Incriminate Chaw, making the plea that
a= he-was arrested at the -same time he
might incriminate himself. Then Carpen
ter figured out a coup d'etat warranted,
not to rip. ravel nor run in the wash. He
moved, that the case against McVicker be
dismissed, and then there was presented
the peculiar spectacle of a defendant's
attorney arguing that his client be held
for trial. It did not work. Barry granted
the motion, and the joy of being able to
- incriminate, himself was no longer Mc-
Vicker's. Carpenter took off his glasses
for the six hundred and tenth time and
with the air of a victor renewed the in
quisition.
Alas for his hop". The coup d'etat
was counterfeit. McVicker would not re
veal tha mystery of the basement. He
had seen nothing there indicative of un
friendly contention between canjnes. The
dogs had been there, to be sure/but they
represented either sex. and for aught the
witness knew were there for friendly pur
poses. , He had not heard a word about
a fi-ghrt. Somebody had mentioned the
' subject. of breeding. Casey had been
I there,- too, but not near the dogs,- and no- j
body hijd shown the least desire to pro
mote a. conflict.
'Carpehte-r next tried to Impeach his
own witness, and when this boon was "de
nied him', quit fii disgust. Neither law
yer made much of a speech. One as
serted -that the dog fight and the presence i
and active interest of Casey had been j
proved; the other that, there had been
nothing to hint at the possibility that a
fight had been contemplated, or that, had '
such an event been planned, nothing to j
connect with It the spotless Chaw. He
stood before the community, did Chaw,
a maligned and misrepresented individual.
with no more inclination toward dog
fighting- than an angel .toward poker.
ThesE: were nut riis â¢ precise words,' but
they convey the Idea. . ' â -
The Court agreed with Mack. He paid
that while he did not approve of â¢ dog
fighting and would be glad to judicially j
eoak anybody guilty of conniving at it, the
prosecution had not made out a case.
There was a cheer, quickly scared to j
silence by -the menacing eye of the court.
Carpenter took off his glasses tho nine
hundred â  and forty-seventh time, and
the rabble "scooted," all anxious to get

MENACE TO PUBLIC SAFETY
A TRIPLE-TRACK SYSTEM FOR
MONTGOMERY STREET.
North Central Improvement Asso
ciation Suggests How Market
Street Railway Company
Can Be Accommodated.
The Supervisors took a decided stand
at their meeting yesterday regarding the
removal of Ac ruins of the Baldwin
Hotel. The matter was brought to the
attention of the members by a request
for the removal of the fence on the Ellis
street sin>. This takes up all the side
walk and a portion of the street. Super
visor Deasy suggested that the removal
of the fence would not do away with all
the objection.
At the suggestion of Mayor Phelan he
presented a resolution later in the ses
sion directing Chief Sullivan of the Fire
Department to take down the walls of the
entire structure. The intention of the
Supervisors is to have the walls razed
at once to prevent accidents to pass
ers-by.
The following communication regarding
the granting of permission to the Market
Street Railway Company to operate its
lines on down town streets was referred
to the Street Committee:

given this matter rareful thought and con
sideration before filing our petition with
your hnnorafil" board on the Sth of last
month to grant the necessary authority to
the railway company to operate cars with
electricity on certain streets. The plan
then suggested contemplated a single-track
â Mtem along Montgomery and Sansome
Ftre^ts. cara running only one way on each
street. Although this was not entirely to
our satisfaction, it was obvious that Mont
gomery street Was fntlrely too narrow for
double tracks. The triple-track system
overcomes this difficulty, leaving ampif>
room hftw-en tracks an.i curbs for wagons
and buggies. Hapld transit In our district
Is a vital necessity, the lacK of which is
pausing property-owners the loss of tenants
and a consequent depreciation in rents and
In the value of property.
The underground system is very expen
sive, both to construct and to operate, and
in view of the experiments now In progress
we are assured the building of this pro
jected line will be delayed for a oonsider
able time unless the overhead system is
used. Such delay would be an injustice to
us.
City and County Attorney Lane was re
quested to furnish the board with an
opinion as to the power of the board in
the matter of compelling the Sutter-street
company to comply witn a recent ro'iucst
of the board. This was to corrugate the
Btone blocks on that portion of the street
which should be kept In order by the
company.
The attention of the managers of the.
City Improvement Company was called
to the fact that a complaint had been
lodged with the board to the effect that
the company was working its men over
eight hours a day. Under the statutes
and the terms of the contract with the
city eight hours constitute a day's labor.
it was determined that lamp posts
which are not used for lighting purposes
shall be allowed to remain standing as
long as they are required by the Post

cation of Dorland street, between Dolores

John F. Boyd requested that the police
patrol box located at the southwest cor
ner of Third and Howard streets bo re
moved to some less conspicuous locality
In the neighborhood. He complains that
it has been a detriment to his property
and an annoyance to his tenants.
Secretary George R. Kibbe, of the Gas

bounded by Eighteenth and Twentieth
Dolores and Church streets, for $3<Â»0.n00.
The Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs asked the board to reconsider Its
recent action against a main sewer for
Ocean View district. The matter was re
ferred to the Street Committee. The fed
eration Indorsed the protest of the West
of Castro Street Improvement Club
against the blasting now being done at
Douglass and Clipper streets.
The application of President James H
Kennedy, of the Excelsior Athletic ciuh,
for a boxing permit for some evening be
tween the Ist and 15th of April was re

USED BLANK CARTRIDGES.
Frank Nickel Arrested for Threaten
ing His Sister's Life.
"I want him charged with threatening
my life and trying to kill me."
Thus spoke Mrs. Annie Bond, a pre
possessing young woman, as she entered
the City Prison last night, accompanied
by her brother. Frank Nickel, who was
under arrest, and Policeman Minnehan.
"He has repeatedly threatened to kill
me," she tearfully remarked, ' but I did
not fear him until he aimed a revolver
at me and fired. I immediately ran from
the house, and meeting the police officer
told him of my brother's attempt to kill
me. I want him sent to jail, as I know
he will injure me unless he is punished."
Mrs. Bond is the wife of Dr. Bond,
whose- domestic troubles have already
been aired in the Superior Court. Accord
ing to her story she went to visit her
mother, who lives at 270 Shipley street,
last evening, when her brother picked up
a small table and threw it at her. As she
ran from the house he drew a revolver
loaded with blank cartridges and fired
three shots at her. Meeting Policeman
Minnehan she told him of the trouble, and
going to the -house he placed Nickel under
arrest. At the City Prison he was
charged with threats against life and dis
charging firearms within the city limits.
Mrs. Bond cannot account for her
brother's conduct except that he has been
drinking heavily, so she claims, and that
his mind is deranged through ths exces
sive use of liquor.
TEACHERS IN SESSION.
Denounce the Old Board and Object to
the Term "Life Tenure."
The San Francisco Teachers' Club met
In the Mercantile Library building last
night and listened to a report from F.
H. Clark, chairman of the committee on
municipal relations. The report briefly
covered the ground of the salary troubles
with the old School Board, terminating
In a condemnation of .the methods of
that body. It also contained a resolution
regarding the common expression of
"life tenure in office for teachers." The
report quoted sections of the civil laws
which show that teachers are elected and
can at any time be deposed for incom
petency or misconduct. In the face of
this, it was argued, there can be no such
thing as life tenure.
The concluding paragraph in the reso
lution, relating to the experiences of the
teachers in the closing months of the last
year, is worthy of attention. It is as
follows:
"We desire to call attention to the fact
that the continuances of teachers at their
posts of duty during the long period of
collapse of the .financial management of
the department proves that their service
is above that of the mere hireling: that
they serve for the cause and not the pay
alone, in no danger of forgetting that th-:
teacher exists for the school and not the
school for the teacher."
For Paving Valencia Street.
The Business Men's Association, recent
ly organized on Valencia street, will urge
on the Supervisors the necessity of hay- ;
Ing: Valencia street paved with bitumen j
from Market to Twenty-eighth. A rough
estimate of the expense has been figured;
on by the board or directors of the asso
ciation. It will cost in the neighborhood
of $53,000 and the members of fhe organi- i
zation consider it is no more than just j
that the city should bear the expense, in- ,
asmuch as Valencia street is one of the
principal thoroughfares leading out of the '
city proper into San Mateo County. All
other local improvements in the vicinity
of Valencia street will be made subservi- ;
ent to this. The committee having charge
of securing signatures to a petition for
this purpose are meeting with encourag- I
nvnt from property and mer
chants, not only on the line of the street
affected, but from a wide circle on both
Bides of-it. â¢ ,â¢â â¢:Â«: â  .-- _^^____

SPENT LIFE
AND FORTUNE
HUNTING GOLD
Captain Burns Dies of
Grief.
THREE USELESS VOYAGES
JUST ENDED A LONG SEARCH
FOR TREASURE ISLE.
When He Passed the Spot in the
Ocean and Found Not the Island
He Wished for
Death,
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 13.
"TVhPn I passed over the exact latitude
and longitude in the Pacific where I ex
pected to find the islands. I was seized
with sickness, so great was my dlsap-
CAPTAIN BURNS AND THE SCHOONER VINE.
polntment. In fact, I felt so bad that I
believed I should not live long."
Bo said Captain John E. Burns last
Thursday to a friend in this city. On
Saturday he died.
The last ten yeaTS of Captain Burns'
life contained more romance than is usua
ly accredited to the hero of a novel. The
captain had spent a fortune and many
of time m hunting treasure islands
and rich guano deposits, but voyages of
. ,-ry invariably terminated in keen
disappointment.
About two months ago Captain Burns
>an Francisco with his schooner
yacht Vine, to discover an island in
â¢the Pacinc, the <xuot position ol whicn
he thought he knew. This island was sup
. to be rich in guano, and Captam
Burns hoped to make a fortune by its
discovery. He laid his plans very care
fully and found the spot where the isl
and should have been. There was noth
ing in sight, and the effect of this tinal
disappointment was in reality fatal. Ine
Vine went to Honolulu and the unhappy
captain returned on the City of Peking
to s;in Francisco, reaching here two
weeks ago. In discussing his ventures
with an Oakland friend Captain Burns
on his return gave the following reasons
for his faith in the lost islaryj:
"For over tw>> centuries," said the cap
tain, "islands have been marked on vari
ous charts at the spot over which we
sailed. Upon the latest charts issued by
the Hydrographic office of the Lnited
States, "the Island appears marked E. P..
which means existence doubtful. On
many other charts and in several atlases
the island is marked as existing between
16 to 22 degrees north latitude and v
to 145 degrees west longitude. At differ
ent times during the past fifty years
three different ships have reported hav
inn seen the island, but strangely enough
its [..cation has never been officially veri
fied When we left San Francisco on this
last voyage it was ostensibly for the pur
pose of carrying a cargo, of lumber to
Honolulu. . ,
"My alleged intention was to pick up
this island and determine its exact loca
tion on our way to Hawaii. Had we
found it the lumber would have been used
for building purposes on the isUtnd \\ c
went fully confident that we should dis
cover it. "and were prepared to hoist the
American Hag upon it, and to establish
ness of carrying guano. So certain
was I <>f finding the place that I had
made arrangements to offer it to a rable
company for a station, as it would be or
vast Importance for this purpose.
"This island was seen by Captain Wil
liams, who imparted his information to
Captain McNear some years ago. Dur
ing the time these two captains were ne
gotiating and preparing to send the ves
sel to work the guano deposits Captain
Williams was stricken with apoplexy and
in Alameda. This was many years
ag.'. His papers were kept by captain
McNear and never saw the light until
years ago. when he gave them to
me McNear, being an old man, despaired
of ever being able to raise the necessary
capital to fit out an expedition and gave
all his knowledge to me. and as soon as
I was able 1 started out on a voyage of
discovery."
Captain Burns made his first voyage in
quest of this island eight years ago.
About thru time he came from Tacoma,
where he had been possessed of consid
erable wealth, the Vine costing $36,800,
and being built entirely for pleasure. But
when misfortune overtook Captain Burns
in the north he had to look to his schoon
er- \acnt for an income. He brought ncr
n Francisco and put her In the lum
ber trade. . '
Four years ago he started on his tirst
trip for' this island, but failed to find it.
Eighteen months ago a party of Phila
delphia capitalists came to the coast with
one of the most gauzy tales ever conceiv
rd. The leader of the party had a map of
Cocos Island showing where was buried
â ;il large chests of Spanish gold. Over
$10 (KM was invested in this enterprise, and
the Vine was chartered to make the voy
age in charge of its owner, Captain
Burns The voyage to Cocos Island was
made, and its owner, August Gissler,
known as the Wild Dutchman, assisted
the party in every way possible to find
the treasure. Of course it was never
found, but the adventurers came back to
the coast after having been shown all
over the fruitful island and being well
informed as to the immense riches which
Gissler was making by growing coffee
and other industries.
Captain Bums formed a very definite
theory regarding the treasure-hunting
voyages which have been made on many
occasions by different parties to this isl
and He believed that all the stories
emanated from some source. Inspired by
Gissler. and that they were nothing more
than an advertising scheme encouraged
by him for the purpose of drawing atten
tion to the valuable island which Gissler
holds by grant from the Costa Rican gov
ei After the return of the Vine from this
trip Captain Burns made a careful study
Of the papers he had received from Cap
tain Williams. After having fully pre
pared for this last voyage of discovery,
he sailed on his supposed Honolulu trip,
from which he returned disappointed as
before. For the past few months he has
lived with his family on this Bide of the
bay. and last Saturday he died, and the
secret of the treasure died with him.
The captain was 65 years of age and ha*
been a navigator since his boy ll^,,.^
ceased leaves a widow and two children.

FINAL ACCOUNT TO REOPEN

Two of the Sons Are Placed Under

Oakland Office San Francisco Call, '
908 Broadway, March 13.
Frank Cunniff, Thomas J. Cunniff and
Francis Cunniff, heirs and children of
John Cunniff, an incompetent, have be
gun a merry war upon J. S. Derby, guar
dian of the latter and adminstrator of
the estates of Catherine Cunniff, their
mother', and John Cunniff.
The sons appeared bofere Judge Hall |
to-day to be heard upon their petition to j
have the adminstrator's final account,
which was recently approved, reopened.
They claim that in Catherine Cunniff 's ;
estate the administrator has included in â 
the txpenscs of the estate board for Mary
Cunniff, a sister, and her father; and that
the inventory and appraisement omitted i
numerous articles, including rents and
cYrtatn cash on deposit in a bank. Fur
thermore that Mary Cunniff has been
managing the affairs of both estates to i
suit herself and "to the prejudice of petl- i
tioners. Their attorney, \V. W. Allen, i
also asked that Derby's bond be raised
from $12,000 to $20.iHX>. This the court or
! dered and the motion to reopen the ad
i ministrator's final account will come up ;
' again two weeks hence,
Attorney Allen stated in court that he â 
proposed to move for Derby's removal on
the ground that the latter had "secluded"
the father in a certain house and did not
allow the children to have access to him.
Attorney de Golia, who represents the
guardian, contends that this was done for
the reason that the children abused the
father and had threatened to take his â¢
I life. Frank and Thomas, two of the sons,
i are now under bonds to keep peace with
their father, this order having been made
some time ago.
The petitioners also complain that in
the estate of their father Derby has al- :
lowed certain expenses to which thoy ob- |
iect Among these are such items as
â¢'rent of pew in church, serving papers on
boys subscription to the Examiner,
kiuhon utensils, etc." They allege also
that the true condition of the estate is
not set forth, since it has been mixed ,
with the estate of Catherine Cunniff.
CORNERED A THIEF
WITH A BROOMSTICK
MRS. CHARLES H. SMITH SAVES
HER HUSBAND'S SHIRTS.
A Pilfering Tramp Brought to Time
After a Lively Race With an
Irate Woman.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
142S Park street, March 13.
Mrs. Charles H. Smith of 154S Verdi street,
wife of the teller of the Anglo-Californian
Bank, saved her husband's laundry Sat
turday from the hands of a thieving
tramp. After the tramp had appropri
ated considerable of Mr. Smith's spotless
linen the wife chased the thief for a
block, cornered him in a vacant lot and
made him disgorge under penalty of be
ing beaten over the head with a broom.
After recovering the stolen property Mrs.
Smith took pity on the pilferer and after
administering a lecture allowed him to
depart.
It was nearly 5 o'clock Saturday
afternoon when the tramp rang the
doorbell to the Smith residence.
There "was no response. The laundryman
had left Mr. Smith's washing on the front
porch. It tempted the tramp. Opening
the bundle he removed a couple of white
shirts and tucked them under his ragged
A neighbor witnessed the theft and in
formed Mrs. Smith, who was in the back
yard. The lady ran through the bouse,
grabbing a broom on the way, and h\i- â 
peared on the sidewalk just as the thief
turned from Verdi street into a vacant lot
near Banta Clara avenue. Mrs. Smith i
gave chase. She caught up Â«vith the ;
Tramp as he was about to scale a high ]
board fence.
"Give me those shirts," she shouted, and
emphasized the command with a
whack of the broom that nearly broke
the tramp's back. "My husband is com
ing around the corner in a minute and he
will fix you. Yqu ought to be ashamed
of yourself, a big. strong man like you
stealing things from doorways."
The tramp was ashamed, but his re
morse was as nothing compared with his
fright. His knees struck together and
his teeth chattered like castanets.
â¢'Mere are the shirts, mum," he stam
mered. "I don't want 'em. I am
ashamed of myself, and if you'll let mo
go this time, kind lady, I'll promise never
to lift another shirt."
Mrs. Smith took her husband's linen,
from which the satin gloss had given way
to the grime from the tramp's hands. As
she observed its condition her chagrin
was manifest. She gave the tramp a
blow with the broom for every finger
mark on the bosom of her husband's
shirts and then allowed him to depart.

BRIDESMAID CHARGED
WITH A BRIDE'S WOES
MRS. SHANE ANSWERS HER
HUSBAND'S STATEMENTS.
Says He Desires to Disown Her -a
Order to Marry Miss Nora
Riordan.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
142Â« Park street, March 13.
Mrs. Lulu Homeicr-Shane Is highly in
dignant at the statements made by her
husband concerning the circumstances
surrounding their wedding and the subse
quent events of their matrimonial career.
In the story published exclusively in last
Friday's Call the husband, George Shane,
of 2714 Bryant street, San Francisco, as
serted that his marriage to Miss Homeier
was a horrible nightmare; that he was in
an alcoholic trance when it happened and
that he knew nothing about the ceremony
until Beveral days later, when he re
gained consciousness.
In contradiction of all this Mrs. Shane
eayn that t*he only nightmare in either H
matrimonial experience has btjen Bill a
Nora Riordan of Ivy avenue, San Fran
cisco, who was bridesmaid at the wed
ding, and who, she claims, has been the
cause of all the trouble between herself
and Mr. Shane since the secret marriage
at San Rafael in October, 1897.
-'A week before our wedding," said Mrs.
Shane to a Call representative, "Mr.
Shane engaged Miss Kiordan and Joseph
Swift to act as bridesmaid and groom,
respectively. That does not look as if
the marriage was planned on the spur of
the moment. We iived together for ftve
months after the ceremony, when I no
ticed that my husband was paying more
attention to "the bridesmaid than tie was
to me. When I remonstrated he threat
ened to beat me and I left him. Later we
met at the home of Dr. Sander in Alame
da to whom I had told my troubles. The
doctor acted the part of peacemaker
and tried to settle the differences between
us but did not succeed. Hix months ago
Mr. Shane got the marriage certificate
from me under pretense of showing it to
his mother. I have learned since that
he destroyed it.
"The same day he gave his story to The
Call he tried to lind me in Oakland, bui
1 kept out of his way, fearing he would
do me bodily injury. I made a great mis
take in keeping our marriage a Becret
so long, but 1 did it to oblige Mr. Shane,
for he was afraid to let his mother know
what be had done."
Mrs. Shane says she will not allow her
husband to get a divorce from her. She
asserts that overtures of that nature
have been made to her.
"He wants to marry the bridesmaid,
Nora Riordan," said Mrs. Shane, "and
he will never do it as long as I can pre
vent it."

NATIVE BORN BUT ARE
NOT CITIZENS IN FACT
IMPORTANT OPINION OF THE
TREASURY SOLICITOR.
Conflicts With a Becent Decision of
the United States Supreme
Court.
The Solicitor of the Treasury has ren
dered a decision which, if sustained and
applied to the Chinese landing here on
the plea of being native-born Americans,
will put a strong check to the flood of
Chinese immigrants.
Several weeks ago an Italian woman
and her two children, aped 6 and 10 years,
were refused a landing at the port of
New York on the ground that they were
liable to become a public charge. They {
appealed to National Immigration Com- â 
missioner Powderly on the ground that '
the children were born in the United
States, and therefore had a right to re
turn to and remain in this country. The
matter was turned over to the Solicitor
of the Treasury, who rendered an opinion
that a child born in this country of a '
foreign father and taken abroad by his J
father acquires said parent's domicile and I
nationality. The children and their moth
er were accordingly .ordered deported to
the country whence they came.
United States Commissioner Heacock, '
who has the initiative in passing upon the i
claims of Chinese seeking entrance to this 'â¢
country by the habeas corpus route, is '
greatly interested in the decision, prin- j
cipally because he has a dissenting opin- !
ion. United States Attorney Foote does !
not think the decision of the Treasury 1
Solicitor will stand because the United
States Supreme Court has decided other
wise in a case which at first glance seems
to be identical with it.
This decision -was rendered March 28,
IS9B. in the case of Wong Kirn Ark, who
claimed to be a native son. He had been
taken back to China by his parents, and
when he sought readmlssion he was ex
cluded on the ground that he was not a
citizen or subject of the United States,
even admitting that he was born here.
The Supreme Court decided that only in
one place in the Constitution was the def
inition of a citizen given, and that was
in section 1, of article XIV: "All per
sons born or naturalized in the United
States, and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof, are citizens of the United State_3
and of the State wherein they reside.
United States Attorney Henry S. Foote
argued the case by brief for the Gov
ernment, and George D. Collins presented
the case for the Chinaman. The Supreme
Court decided, several of its members dis
senting, that the language of that por
tion of the Constitution quoted was do
claratorv of the common law and not or
international law, and that therefore a
person born in the United States is a
citizen irrespective of the political status
of his parents. The only exceptions to
! this rule are the children of sovereigns,
ambassadors and alien enemies
Judge Heacock is studying the United
States decision and comparing Â« witn
that of the Solicitor of the Treasury It
the two cases are alike he will be bound
by the decision of the Supreme Court and
pay no heed to that of the Solicitor But
if they are cases involving a d J ff */.?"* if "
sue he may be able to reconcile the two
opinions on broad principles of law.

WIFEBEATERS PUNISHED.
One Gets Six Months and the Other
Is Held to Answer Before the
Superior Court.
Two wifebeaters were severely dealt
with in the Police Courts yesterday, and
Judge Graham in the case brought before
him remarked that the pillory should be
introduced for such a man.
S. L. Stare's wife, who lives at 101 Min
na street, testified before Judge Graham
i that she had supported her husband for
the past seven years. He was in the
habit of abusing and beating her and last
Friday he called at her house and ac
cused her of being out of the house the
previous night. She denied it and he
grabbed hold of her right arm and, twist
ing it round, broke it in two places. She
had bruises on her body from his blows.
The Judge, In sentencing him to six
months in the County Jail, said he was
sorry the law prohibited him from mak
ing it more. He thought the old custom
of the pillory should be brought into use
for such brutes as the defendant. It was
one of the worst cases that had ever been
brought to his notice.
Jacob Pollan. 261 Shipley street, ap
peared before Judge Conlan to answer a
charge of assault with a deadly weapon
upon his wife, Rebecca. A week ago he
threw a block of wood at her and fol
lowed it up by throwing a pot of boil
ing water at her. It was suggested that
the charge be reduced to battery, but
Pollan spoke up and demanded a trial by
jury charging the Judge, prosecuting at
torney and police with conspiring to rail
road 'him to jail. The Judge remarked
that he would give him the chance of trjal
by jury and held him to answer before
the Superior Court in $1000 bonds on the
charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
Daniel Harney's Will.
The will of Daniel Harney, the well
known contractcr, who died a few days
ago, leaving property valued at $16,000,
was filed for probate yesterday. All the
personal property is bequeathed to
Charles S. and Joseph D. Harney. Wini
fred E. White and Mary E. O'Hara, chil
dren of the deceased. The real estate is
devised to Charles S. Harney, the income
thereof to be divided among the children
named.
Dora Fuhrig's Case.
Arpumpnt was commenced yesterday In
the case of Mrs. Dora Fuhrig. charged
with the murder of Mrs. Walmsley. As
sistant District Attorney Black opened on
behalf of the prosecution. Attorney Fuhr
man followed for the defense, and this
morning Robert Ferral will argue. Dis
trict Attorney Murphy will close the case.

OPENING
GRAND OPERA
SEASON.
By Ashton Stevens.
OTHER pen? in other newspapers
will hark back this morning to
i)),- good old days when Pattl
came to San Francisco and the
gilded t>wn turned out in thou
sands and the Grand Opera-house was
a siphi and a sound to enchant the
world. Those Patti times were great
times. They have been a big tradition
to us. tii which we looked back proudly
during the long years of operatic pov
erty that followed. Traditions are
valuable things in a city amputated
from the main body of things operatic
as nurs is; but even the best of them
Krow Btale in time. And ours, except
for the memory of Melba's prodigious
little operatic concert season of last
year, were In a woeful state until last
night.
With last night we acquired a whole
new sot of traditions; we re-immortal
ized our name in the world of impre
sarios; we gave Melba and the Ellis
company a reception which represented
the host that San Francisco, California,
could afford. Talk about your Patti
nights! I remember a few of them, but
nothing that surpasses this opening.
AH that we possess in the way of fash
lon, culture, jewelry and gownery was
offered up last night. The lower floor,
the proscenium boxes, the palco boxes
and the dress circle were masses of
milky shirt bosoms and creamy shoul
ders shot with diamonds and pearls. It
was a wonderful, picturesque night.
Not even the Morosco wallpaper that
adorned the walls, nor the Morosco
ushers poulticed in weird comic opera
costumes that stood in the aisles and
did almost anything but attend prop
erly to their business, could mar the
spell. The town was there in its gor
geous best, and the house was a pic
ture.
I cannot tell you about the thousands
that stood up to witness the perform
ance, for the very good reason that
there was no place for them to stand.
The seats are set right up to the rear
wall and standing room is limited to a
short single line on each side and small
groups in the doorways. The box office
wisely refrained from selling more than
a few admission tickets, so there was
no crowding in the unpleasant sense;
but tho audience, which filled every
seat (they are snug little seats, tightly
packed), was, I dare say, the largest
that ever attended an opera in San
Francisco. And what a mighty applause
it made!
And now for the opera, which after
all is the last thing to be considered on
an opening night. It was that good old
opener, "Faust," and Melba sang Mar
guerite. It was a Melba night with a
vengeance, and the honors, except those
that attended Boudouresque's excel
lent Mephistopheles, were all hers. In
the first place, Bonnard, who was cast
for Faust, was announced ill and Pan
dolfini substituted in the part. Pandol
fini was notified at 6 o'clock, and it is
only fair to say that perhaps his voice
was not ready to be unpacked at such
short notice. He did his best in the
circumstances, and it was not a bad
best, but it was not what the audience
had been keyed up to expect, and it is
a matter of record that the part of
Faust was not a notable success. Pan
dolfini has a light tenor and a very
â¢white tenor, and his tone is recklessly
open and scattering in the top notes'.
His singing lacked color and his acting
lacked character.
Another disaster was the orchestra.
Mind, I am not trying to make the
orchestra out second rate, for I know
it to be one of the best in the country.
It to be one of the finest in the country;
that has ever visited us in association
with an opera company. But it was
atrociously placed last night. The
reeds and brass were buried in that
"6hell" under the apron of the stage,
and blew they never so hard they could
hardly be heard. The strings, which
were in decent sight and sound, were
forced to carry the entire burden of the
orchestration. At such times as the
cues for the pitch were given out by
the clarionets or by the oboes, the
singers were In a frightful predica
ment. From Mjelba down everybody
had more or less of a turn at singing
off the key. But there will be no more
shelled orchestra in the Ellis season.
It is officially promised that the brasses
and reeds will come up out of their well
and blow tunefully In the sight of all,
commencing to-night.
Except for the lights on the stage,
â¢which were weak and uncertain, all the
rest is praise. The scening, robing and
stage management were admirable, and
Melba showed us a new phase of her
art in the possibilities offered by Mar
guerite. Her's was a simple, ingenu
ous Marguerite, untheatric and very
Gretchen-like at first; but it grew in
strength and spell as the piece de
veloped and brought out the passion
and dramatic strf ngth that had had
little or no part in Melba's work here
last season in the lighter and more or
namental operas.
It was, indeed, apart from the match
less voice and vocalization, a strong,
impressive essay in musical character
ization. Melba may not be a great
actress, but she is certainly a very'
pocd one in this part; and she sings it
a.s no other woman can to-day, with all
the freshness, purity and spontaneous
vigor that the music demands. So far
as my memory serves me, the garden
scene was every bit as enthralling aa
when Patti sang it in her palmiest
days.
There were hitches in the ensemble,
but Melba's work . was perfect. She
Bang the "Jpflg. pf Th^4g" legend, &
Society ar)d Lovers of Art Are
Enthralled by the Queer) of
Sor>g.
Just the. right way: she mused it, as
one will sometimes muse aloud some
treasured bit of verse. She did not
work the spinning wheel, but busied
herself twining ribbons about the flax
and fondling the flowers. The jewel
song she sang with full and obvious
effect, giving brilliant emphasis to its
moments of surprise, elation and con
cern. It was superb in character and
execution. And in the love scene there
were glow and leap and rich human
ness. Fortunately the church scene
was included in the production, and in
this Melba did full, strenuous work.
There is little need at this time of day
to attempt to describe Melba's voice
and her mode of singing. Not the least
of her greatness lies in the fact that we
can now forget the details of tone and
execution in the mature art with which
she presents an operatic character. Her
Marguerite is a superlative conception,
and it is doubtless a token of what she
will do in "La Boheme" and In "Romeo
and Juliet."
Boudouresque, as I have already said,
was an excellent Mephistopheles. He
brings humor to the devil In large
measures, and his whole performance
Is marked by a certain feline grace that
is very pat to the part. His voice, like
his acting and his person, is lithe and
full of arch suggestion, and his tone is
unerringly true.
Mme. Van Cautren did a bit of un
obtrusively good character as Martha;
Mme. Olitzka was a good if not sensa
tionally good Seibel, and Bensaude did
as much as is usually done with Valen
tine.
The chorus was large and in perfect
hand and Seppilll was not to be blamed
for the smothering of half his or
chestra.
Summing up, the disasters were Mr.
Morosco's -atent "shell" and a sick
tenor. Both will be remedied, and as
all the rest was success we can give
the glad hand of welcome to Mr. Ellis
and his singers for eleven perform
ances to come. _
AS 'TWAS IN THE
DAYS OF YORE
History is repeating itself. .Those
Who have been dazzled by the glorious
tales of the past may revel in the pres
ent and enjoy to the full the oft-quoted
magnificence of the epoch-making Patti
nights.
The grand opera season was inaugu
rated last evening, /nd the wealth' and
beauty, the glitter and elegance that
fashion and art deemed should follow

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 14, 1899.
thrill and delight even the most fas
tidious of adored deitiesâ the Queen of
Song.
Art and Society, for once, met on a
mutual footing. Art held out her sensi
tive hand, and Society, ablaze with Jew
els and glittering and glimmering in
satins and silks and costly laces, grate
fully returned the greeting.
"Welcome," said Art.
"You do me proud," said Society.
This graceful fusion of two opposites
made up an audience that those for
tunate enough to form a part of will
never cease to remember.
Scattered in among fortune's favor
ites lovers of the true, the beautiful,
the artistic lent the tone necessary to
conclusively prove that it was the pow
er of music, the enthralling gift of
song, that called them together and in
spired them all. L ... .
The brilliancy l of the scene within
presented a striking contrast to the
garish one without. Mission street on
either side was lined with a motley
crowd, that engulfed itself and
struggled and tossed in a vain desire
to see those who held the magic paste
board that opened the portals to the
temple of music. Apparently south of
Market street resented the invasion of
their sphere by society. They seemed
to consider that a sacrilege had been
committed. That their temple of popu
lar price melodrama should be Invaded
by art was the thorn in their Morosco
nourlshed flesh.
However, they reveled in the music
made by the rumble of the carriages.
At one time the line of vehicles extend
ed from the theater entrance nearly up
to Fifth street. There was -no little in
convenience caused by the fact that
many of them came down Third street,
thus creating a jam and resulting in
unnecessary confusion.
While the audience was in the midst
of its arrival the crowd in front of the
theater was so great that passage
along the street was almost impossible.
The audience was one that for bril
liancy has never been equaled in the
history of San Francisco. It was gen
erally remarked that the women were
more beautifully and elaborately
gowned, and the men better groomed,
than on any other similar gathering
seen here. Â
The gradual arrival of the audience
was an interesting scene. S.ome came
to see and others to be seen; some to
hear and others to be heard. The two
bitter classes were not entirely seated
until the beginning of the second act.
Indeed, the beauty of the first act was
greatly marred by the advent of the
late arrivals. In the first act whern
Faust sings "Io voglio II Piacer," the
air was not audible in the rear of the
house owing to the noise caused by
seating those who came late.
Then, again, the fact that the ushers
were new to the house, and that the
first act is almost entirely a dark one,
made the difficulty of -finding the seats
all the greater. Those that came for
Art's sake were in consequence greatly
That not a single seat in the theater
was unoccupied is sufficient proof that
Â§an Francisco loves and can appreciate
as well as any city in the world high
musical art. For the most part the ap
probation of the audience was well
timed and conservative, and clearly
demonstrated that it was capable of
analysis and criticism.
It was essentially Melba's night. The
occasional titter and hum of voices that
ran through the audience were heard
only when the lesser stars were sing
ing.
When the curtain fell on the third
act the stage was a mass of flowers.
From the boxes they bombarded the
prima donna with fragrant blossoms,
and when she bowed her acknowledg
ments to the fourth encore her arms
were filled with beautiful floral tokens.
SOCIETY FILLS
THE HOUSE
Nearly everybody who Is anybody was
at the opera. Those who are musical
and those who follow where the so
cial leaders beckonâ all moved In one joy
ous crowd to greet the singers at the
opera house. The boxes all had their iill
of gay and brilliant parties. The orches
tra bowed to parquet, the family circle
and to the gallery, and there were happy
greetings all round.

BLANCHE WALSH
GIVES SARDOU'S
PLAY "FEDORA"
Her Acting Natural
and Womanly.
With the Grand Opera volleying and
thundering almost within voice-sound,
Blanche Walsh's "Princess Fedora" en
tered upon the boards. There was not
that warm meeting between the stage
and the seats that enthuses the actor at
the Columbia last evening. Yet the fer
vor of Sardou's strong lines found full
and true interpretation in the rendition
of that talented young star:
Fedora is Russian, and the fire and
the ice, the conspiracy, the revenge and
the tragic finish of a Russian love is hers.
She trails the slayer of a lover from St.
Petersburg to Paris and finds him to lure
him to a confession, to denounce him and
to love him. She compromises herself to
save him, and when he turns on her in
fury finding that she has unwittingly
caused the death of his brother, she pois
ons herself and dies in a noble and thrill-
ill cr seenÂ©
Portions of Miss Walsh's Interpretation
are beautifully womanly, especially in the
fine control of herself while her lover is
reading the letter that tells him of her
duplicity. Melbourne MacDowell is her
fitting mate in this great two-character
play, strong in his . love and intense in
his hate. The production should draw
good houses the remainder of the week.
The /\lcazar.
The society comedy drama "The Social
Highwayman" was presented to a crowd
ed house at the Alcazar last night. The
piece is â¢ dramatized from Elizabeth
Phlpps Train's novel of the same name,
and deals with the thefts of jewels from
fashionable women by Courtice Jaffrey, a
society man. It was in this play that
the Holland brothers made a great suc
cess and the same was achieved by
George Osbourne last night in the part of
Jenkins Hanby, Courtice's servant. It
was an ideal representation of the part
of Â«a servant with a bad record, but de
votedly attached to his master for be
friending him in time of need. Ernest
Hastings, in the title role, was excellent,
and the other members of the company,
including Gertrude Foster, who assumed
the leading role owing to Miss Fitzallen's
Indisposition, acquitted themselves cred
itably. - â 
The Orpheum. Â«
The Orpheum has its usual good bill
again this week. Of the new people the
biggest hit was made by the Pantzer trio,
who really excel as contortionists. In this
line they are about the best that have
been seen here. The troubadour trio make
a fine stage, appearance and their coon,
songs with a French accent were a hit.
j. \V. Wlnton, the ventriloquist, is clever
as such . and his walking, talking, smok
ing figures are among the best seen here.
The Fortunia brothers, comedy acrobats,
are favorites: also the Marco twins and
others, making an interesting bill.
Jhe TiVoli.
While swelldom rustled in silks and sat- '
ins and sparkled with diamonds at the
Grand Opera, the. hoi polloi of the music
loving world assembled at the Tivoll
and received in more than a moiety of
music an equivalent for their monetary
mites. "The Pretty Poacher," by Offen
bach, is far from being one Uie best of
his works either in the book ,or in the
score. While there are a few graceful
bits of melody twined around â¢ its non
sense and improbabilities, it lacks that
"come again" charm that would induce
one to go to hear it more . than a week
or two. In the hands of a poor or indif
ferent company it would lose what little
salt it has, but the excellent company
that took care of it last night rescued
it from what would otherwise have been
a chilly reception, .-j .
The event of the evening was the de
but of Gerald Gerome, a tenor. Gerald
is graceful, with a pleasing voice and
style, and in a role of more virility than,
that of, Theodore will win popularly. Ha ,

all new songs.
TKe Chutes.
Sherman and Morrissey. acrobatic com
edians, made a great hit at the Chutes
Free Theater last evening. Their bur
lesque trapeze performance is exceed
ingly funny and created great laughter.
The Four Miltons are clever musicians
and singers, and their saxophone quar
tets were heartily applauded. William
Howard is an original monologist, and
Ethel Lynwood is one of the best con
tortionists who ever twisted in San
Francisco. The Michelsen brothers
changed their banjo duets, and many new
moving pictures were shown. The ama
teur Cakewalk will be repeated Thursday
night.
Steeplechase.
To remain under water for three mln
untes is a feat which seems impossible,
but at the Steeplechase at Central Park
this week one of the Japanese female
swimmers accomplishes this nightly. The
illusion of the "Human Spider" as shown
by William Kohl is most mystifying and
its inventor defies any one to explain it.
The other extra attractions and the per
manent ones make the grounds well worth
a visit.

Owing 1 to a severe cnM tho concert

A meeting of the parents and friends of
the soliders in the First California Vol

Sons 1 Hall this evening, when letters and
telegrams recently received from the War
Department relative to the return of tha
California boys from the Philippines will
be read.
