READING. Pa., May 12.â A collision
of passenger trains occurred on the
Philadelphia and Reading Railroad at
Exeter, about six miles south of this
city, to-night, and a great number of
pet-pie were killed nr injured. There is
no telegraph office at Exeter and de
tails, therefore, are difficult to obtain.
The number of killed is variously stated
to be from fifteen to twenty-five. Fully
fifty others are injured.
The regular express train from Potts
ville for Philadelphia connected at th"
station in Reading with a train from
Harrisburg. which was â¢â - -led with
excursionists., who had been to the
State? capital to witness the ceremonies
In connection with the unveiling of the
Hartranft monument. Many of the
Harrisburg passengers at Reading went
aboard the Philadelphia express, but.
It b^ing found that all could not be ac
commodated, it was decided to send an
extra train tb Philadelphia to run as
the second section of the express. The
extra train left twenty minutes later
than the' express. At Exeter the ex
press stopped for orders, and while
standing still the extra train crashed
Into it while moving at great speed.
Three of the rear cars of the express
â were telescoped and the first car of
the extra train was wrecked. The pas,
senders in these cars were terribly
mangled, many being killed outright,
while other? had limbs and bodies
maimed. Word was at once sent to
Reading and a special train with phy- j
sicians and nurses was sent to th I
ecene as quickly as it could possibly be
put into readiness. The identified billed j

ROSWELL P. FLOWER
IS CALLED TO REST
NEW YORK, May 12. -Former Governor Roswell P. Flower died to
night at 10:30 at the Eastport Country Club at Eastport, L. I. Mr.
Flower was taken ill early in the day with a severe attack of acute in
. digestion. In the afternoon symptoms of heart failure supervened and
he grew steadily worse until the time of his death. The attack of
heart failure was accompanied by a fainting spell, and Mr. Flower's fam
ily in New York City was quickly notified. Mrs. Flower and the former
Governor's nephew, Frederick S. Flower, accompanied by Dr. Thomas H.
Allen. Mr. Flower's physician, left at once on a special train for Eastport.
When they arrived there Mr. Flower had somewhat recovered, but to-night
the attack of heart failure was marked and Mr. Flower became unconscious
an hour or more before his death.
Mr. Flower had been a sufferer from gastritis for a long time, every
now and then an acute attack. For a month or two past he has been a
regular visitor at the Eastport Country Club in the hope that he would find
some relief in the outing He appeared in robust health yesterday, and this
morning when he arrived at stport, where he intended to remain until
Monday, his health was apparently excellent. The attack from which he suf
fered to-day came on suddenly and was of a more severe type at the outset
than any he had previously suffered from.
Frederick S. Flower took charge of the details after his uncle's death,
but no arrangement for the funeral has yet been made. The body will prob
ably be transferred to Manhattan to-morrow morning.
Rosweil P. Flower was born in Theresa, Jefferson County, N. V., Au
gust 7. 1835. Roswell was the sixth of nine children and when his father
died he was 8 years old. He worked with his brothers on two farms his
mother owned and spent his time between school sessions in the hardest
kind of labor. He became deputy postmaster of Watertown, N. V., in 1853
and kept his place six years.' Then he became a partner in the jewelry
firm of Hitchcock & Flower, bought out his partner at the end of two
years and continued in the business until 1869.
Mr. Flower came to New York in that year to take charge of the estate
of Henry Keep, whose widow was Mrs. Flower's sister. Mr. Keep owned a
great many railroad and other stocks and during the months before his
death spent much time in instructing Mr. Flower about them. Having
thus gained an insight into Wall street and its methods Mr. Flower formed
in 1Â«70 the firm of Benedict. Flower & Co., in which he joined E. C. Benedict
and H. H. Truman. This firm was dissolved in I^7_. Not long afterward he
organized the banking firm of Flower & Co., which has since been a power
in Wall street.
Mr. Flower always was a Democrat. In the early seventies he helped
Samuel J. Tilden to develop the famous organization which exposed Tweed
and enjoyed many other triumphs. Mr. Flower was chosen chairman of
the Democratic State Committee in 1877, and in 1881 he defeated William
Waldorf Astor for Congress after* a hot campaign in the Eleventh District.
His majority was 3100, while Levi P. Morton, Republican, had carried it at
the last previous election by more than 7000 votes. He refused a renomin
ation. He was elected Governor of the State in 1891J
Mr. Flower took up Brooklyn Rapid Transit less than two years ago
buying from 20.000 to 30,000 shares at about $25, when the capital stock was
only $25,000,000. He absorbed many subordinate lines, among them the
Nassau Electric Company, and increased the capital stock to $45,000,000. and
by his extraordinarily successful manipulation, put the price up to 137 His
holdings in Brooklyn Rapid Transit alone, which cost him two years ago
little more than $500,000. ire worth, at to-day's market price more than
$3,000,000. , . *

â  to-day:
"The Rev. Dr. Briggs and the Rev.
Charles H. Snedecker will be ordained
on the day officially appointed by the
Bishop of New York, May 14, at the

Bishop Potter chose the pro-cathedral

asked to be assigned to work there and
: will work there in future.
'The Churchman of this week says:
The sensational stories that have ap
peared in the daily press with regard to
the ordination of Dr. Briggs suggested the
necessity of giving to our readers certain
Information -that may help them to a
right judgment in the premises.
Rev. Dr. Briggs was ordained to the
dlaconate last year, having met all
canonical regulations, and after having
been recommended by a standing com
mittee, composed of the Revs. Morgan
Dix. Thomas H. Harris, Octavus Apple
gate and J. S. Shlpman and Messrs.
Stephen P. Nash. G. A. Miller. S. Nichol
son Kane and Herman C. Van Post. He
has met all the requirements for advance
ment to the prieshood and has been rec
ommended again by this same committee,
with only one change in Its composition.
Many persons have been disturbed by
passages quoted in the dally papers from
Dr. Briggs' late book. It is only fair to
state that most' of these passages appear
to be wrested from their true setting.

CATHOLIC CITIZENS OF
'> THE UNITED STATES
Monsignor Martinelli on the Attitude
of the Church Regarding Re
publican Governments.
NOTRE DAME, Ind.. May -Monsig
nor Martinelli to-night gave out the fol
lowing interview:
I am delighted with the news and the evi
dence that our Catholic citizen* are among
the most ardent supporters of the American
Government. In some quarters there is an er
roneous impression that the papal church is
opposed to a republican form of government.
It Is not necessary to leave the Western hem
isphere to prove the untruth of th".? assertion.
Most of the countries in South America are
republics, and in all of them a vast majority
of the citizens are Catholics. . ,r ,
In the matter of education. I think science,
religion and knowledge should go hand ln hand.
Revealed religion' especially should have a
place In the schools. In the matter of moral
ity America ranks with the foremost nations
of the world. Concerning the growth of the
Catholic religion in America I can say It Is
making a greater number of converts now than
at any previous time, especially among the
higher classes. . '.''c ' . - '
The Pope's attitude toward the question of
the war has been emphasized In no doubtful
way. He is emphatically for peace. He Is
willing to arbitrate in the settlement of any
differences when his services are requested:
when they are not. he indirectly uses his In
fluence as best he can.
I am delighted that the Catholic Institutions
of America are keeping abreast of the times. i
The church has always been a patron of art
and science. Concerning Notre Dame, I- have j
seen nothing like It among the colleges I have
visited In this country-
THE SYRIAN REPUBLIC
NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY
Declaration of Independence Looked
Upon Only as a Symptom of
Unrest.
WASHINGTON, May 12.â manifes
to declaring the independence of Syria, is
sued yesterday in New York by the Young
Syria Junta, is not taken seriously in of
ficial quarters here except as an evidence
of the unrest which has prevailed among
Turkish subjects living abroad, Includ
ing the Syrians, Armenians and the Turks
themselves, who conduct a revolutionary
organization known as Young Turks.
The reports from United States officers
in Syria and from United States Minister
Straus at Constantinople have shown no
recent uprising or discontent in Syria.
The Turkish Minister. All Ferroupbey,
said to-day the manifesto was entirely
without importance and did not represent
a sentiment prevailing among the Syrians
in this country or at home. Only recent
ly the Minister was given a handsome re
ception In New York by the resident Sy
rians, during which the most cordial man
ifestations were shown him and this Is
said to be the sentiment among the seri
ous and responsible element of this peo
ple. The only opposition element, the
Minister points out. Is made up of a few
men interested in publishing Arabic pa
pers in New York and other parts of the
country, but these, he says, in no way
voice the sentiments of the Syrians.

STATUE OF GENERAL
HARTRANFT UNVEILED
HARRISBURG, Pa., May 12.â The bronze equestrian statue of Gen
eral John F. Hartranft in Capitol Park was unveiled with impres
sive ceremonies this afternoon in the presence of a large concourse.
After the ceremonies in Capitol Park a procession formed with
General Levi A- Dodd of Baltimore as chief marshal and J. P. Cooke
of Lewiston as chief of staff. The reviewing party included Governor and
Mrs. Stone, Mrs. Hartranft and family. Secretary Alger, Postmaster Gen
eral Smith, Adjutant General Corbin, Mrs. Levi A. Dodd of Baltimore,
Major General Gregg of Reading and members of the Senate and House
of Representatives. There were over 3000 men in line. The survivors of
the Third Division of the Ninth Army Corps, commanded by General Hart
ranft in the Civil War, had the right of line. The procession also in
cluded the Ninth Regiment of immune? from Camp Meade, a provisional
brigade of the National Guard, the Grand Army of the Republic posts and
Sons of Veterans camps of Harrisburg and vicinity and the Harrisburg
fire department.
The statue represents General Hartranft as he appeared at the close of
the war. He is shown returning to his native town in the act of saluting
the people, who applaud him and throw across his path laurel and palm
branches, over which the horse walks as if he felt proud to carry his mas
ter on the occasion of his triumphal return home. The statue is nearly
fourteen feet high, and is mounted on a fourteen-foot polished red granite
pedestal in front of the Capitol of Pennsylvania, at Harrisburg.
John Frederick Hartranft was born at New Hanover, Montgomery
County, Pa., on December 16, 1830. During the Civil War he was a colonel
of Pennsylvania volunteers and won his stars by carrying the famous
stone bridge at Antietam. He was appointed major general, and command
ed a division in General Burnside's Ninth Army Corps. General Hartranft
was Governor of Pennsylvania from 1873 to 1879 and in 18-76 was Pennsyl
vania's candidate for the Presidency.
. After the expiration of his term as Governor, General Hartranft devoted
his life to the reorganization of the Pennsylvania National Guard, of which
he was made major general. It was through his military-knowledge and
ability that it became the model guard of the country. Major General Hart
ranft died at Norristown, Pa., on October 17, 18S9.
AGUIRRE IS
NOT YET IN
HALES PLACE
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, May 12.â '
When the Board of State Prison Di
rectors met in regular monthly session
to-day it was confidently predicted that
the sun would rise to-morrow morning,
and cast its beams on the head of a new
Warden. The wiseacres were sure of
this because somebody had said Gov
ernor Gage was to be present at the
meeting by his booted and august per
sonality. Gage was at the meeting, and
so was ex-Sheriff Martin G. Aguirre.
but W. E. Hale retains the wardenship.
The Governor arrived, in company |
with Aguirre and Attorney Chretien,
on the noon train, and. together with
the Directors, dined with the Warden.
Afterward the party was escorted
throughout the prison and initiated into
the mysteries of the jute mill. Several
prisoners from the south were recog
nized by Gage, who shook hands with
them and in two Instances stepped
away from the party to hold private
conferences with convicts. One, Cap
tain James, who is serving three years
for having sent obscene literature
through the mails, was made the espe
cial recipient of Gage's favors, and af
ter the hearing of a private grievance
Warden Hale was beckoned to join
the two.
The board went into executive ses
sion at 2 o'clock, and was closeted with
the Governor for nearly three hours.
It was afterward announced that
Aguirre had not been elected Warden,
for very good reasons.
"Mr. Aguirre will be appointed War
den at the meeting to be held at Fol
som a week from to-morrow, or at a
special meeting a few days later," said
Director Hayes. "At this session he
was simply introduced to us by the
Governor, who spoke highly of his
qualifications and said it was his de
sire to see him elected. Mr. Aguirre
has proved a pleasing candidate to tha
board, and will be the next Warden un
less something unforeseen occurs."
The Governor, with Aguirre, Chretien
and several others, was taken to San
Francisco on the stern-wheeler Caro
line as soon as the meeting adjourned..
All appeared in good humor, and both
Gage and his protege wore smiles of
satisfaction. V.'- "..
At the morning session Warden Hale
read his report on the punishment he
thought merited the nine conspirators
who tried to escape from the prison.
It was adopted in the afternoon, when â 
Director Devlin arrived, making a full
board. :^i .;'
George W. Schlegal, George Bullock.
Edward Morrell and H. W. Cooper were
termed ringleaders, and in addition to
the punishment which they have al
ready received, the first three, being
"lifers," are to be confined in the soli
tary cells in the front .cell building un- |
til the incorrigible cells are completed.
They will then be confined in the incor
rigible cells and forced to do hard la
bor in the manufacture of grainbags
by hand at the discretion of the War
den. Cooper will lose all his credits,
besides receiving the same punishment :
as the other ringleaders. Si Loverin, !
H. M. Shaw and James Roup will be ;
confined in the Incorrigible department â¢
at the discretion of the Warden. Alton I
H. Gould has already forfeited all cred
its and is now confined in the prison
hospital with rheumatism. Punishment
in his case is suspended until such time
as the administering of it may be
deemed advisable. As - only eight
months' credits can be forfeited by
Cooper, King and Chevalier will lose
their credits for the same time, as it
was deemed only just to make them
lose no more than a ringleader. All the
conspirators are to be kept dressed in
red flannel shirts.
Walter Furnish and Louis Ferez
pleaded guilty to an attempt at smug
gling opium into the prison on May 8
and were deprived of all their credits.
Their cases are to be referred to Dis
trict Attorney Mclsaac, with instruc
tions to prosecute both men as soon as
their terms expire in autumn. These
are the first opium smugglers detected
since the law making smuggling a fel
ony went into effect, and an example
will be made of them.
The Warden's grainbag and Jute re
ports were about the same as last
month. His financial report shows that
the sale of grainbags will leave $160,000
for the State prison fund after the jute
revolving fund is filled.

LOS ANGELES, May 12. â Mrs. A.
Moore, employed as housekeeper by Hen

this morning In a. fire which also com

YUKON RIVER IS NOW
OPEN TO NAVIGATION
Steamer Flora Plows Her Way
Through the Floating Ice
to Dawson.
VICTORIA, May 12.â Navigation has
opened on the Yukon. The river steamer
Flora of the Lake Bennett and Klondike
Navigation Company was the first vessel
to plow her way through the floating ice
between Dawson City and Lake Lebarge.
According to news received by the steamer
Amur, which arrived this evening, the
Flora was launched at the foot of Lake
Lebarge on April 15, and two days later
she headed for Dawson City. Her prow
had been covered with steel pistes to
protect her from the floating Ice packs.
The trip was necessarily slow, lor in
places so thick was the Ice that she had
practically to cut her way through. The
vessel managed to reach the Klondike
capital after fourteen days of perilous

NOOSE FOR THE
MURDERER OF LINN
Claude Branton Hanged
at Eugene.
â â¦ â
EUGENE, Or.. May ' Claude
Branton was hanged to-day for the
murder of John Linn. Branton left his
cell at 10:45. and walking upon the I
scaffold unassisted he took his place j
I upon the trap. He asked the people j
present not to bear any ill will against j
his relatives on his account. The trap j
'. was sprung at 10:50. Fifteen minutes I
later the body was cut down.
The crime for which Claude Branton j
paid the penalty of death was the tak- |
' ing of the life of John Linn, a stock- ;
man of Condon, Gilliam County. In
April, IS9B, Branton and Courtland !
Green, who is now serving a life sen
tence in the penitentiary for complic
ity in the crime, left their, homes near
Walterville, Lane County, to go to
Eastern Oregon to work. Branton had
received from Linn a proposition to
' work for him herding a band of horses.
While working in Eastern Oregon
Branton and Green laid plans to mur
der Linn to get the horses and some
money which they believed he had.
They induced him to cross the moun
tains with them, representing to him
that on arriving at Branton's home at
Walterville he (Branton) would trade
â¢ him a piece of land for an interest in
: the horses. Before starting he was
told that Branton and Green had
planned to get away with him. but he
I did not believe it.
On the night of June IV Linn rolled
; himself in his blankets near the camp
fire and went to sleep. After he had
| been asleep for some time Branton shot
him two or three times with a revol
ver and then, assisted by Green, placed
I the body on the/ fire. They remained
up all night and frequently replenished
the fire with rails until the body was-,
consumed. Then they raked the small
â¢ pieces of bones from the ashes, tied
them in a sack and hid them.
Branton left the country, but news
,of the crime soon got out. On July 3
Courtland Green, who was arrested,
made a confession, and a search was
; immediately commenced for Branton.
In the latter part of July he returned
to Eugene and was arrested before he
knew that the story of the crime had
been made public.

PINOLE, May. 12.â James M. Clancy
shot and killed Henry Welsh at Ro
land's blacksmith ship on San Pablo
Creek last night at 10 o'clock. Both
men had been drinking very heavily
all the evening. They became engaged
in an altercation over some trivial mat
ter. Welsh became very much excited
and drew a knife on Clancy, who tried
to escape from the building, but Welsh
jumped into the doorway and prevented
his retreat. Clancy then drew his re
volver and shot Welsh four times, kill
ing him instantly.
Both men are quite young and were
born and raised in this vicinity.
Word of the murder was brought to
the Sheriff this morning about 3 o'clock
and officers immediately started for
Orinda.
Clancy gave himself up. He claims
that the shooting was done in self-de
fense.
Roland says he was awakened by
! some one knocking on the building; he
; called out and Welsh walked in and
asked for money with which to pur
chase some wine. The old roan in
formed him that he had no money, but
gave him an order.
In the meantime Clancy had come in
I and the three then sat down to the ta
: ble, when Welsh returned and com*
j menced to drink. Just how the row
, started is not known, but the old man \
\ says that as the boys kept drinking
they became angry, and that finally
Welsh said to Clancy: "I gave your
i brother a good licking a short time ago
and I can do you up just as good."
Welsh then grabbed a butcher knife
that was on the table and made a lunge
cat Clancy. Clancy dodged the blow,
i but Welsh followed him up, and just j
i as Welsh was about to plunge the knlfa
j into Clancy, Clancy pulled his revolver

Clancy is said to be the son of a

A dead MAN'S grave
Bishop Montgomery Brings Action
Against the William McDer
mott Estate.
LOS ANGELES, May 12â Bishop Mont
gomery, head of the Catholic church in
Southern California, desires payment of
claim 136 due the Catholic church of this
city from the estate of William McDer
mott, who was proprietor of the Fashion
livery stable and died a year ago, leav
ing an estate valued at . $5000. Bishop
Montgomery's claim is for a dead man's
grave in the Catholic cemetery.
Mrs. Carrie McDermott, special admin
istratrix, filed a supplementary account
ing of receipts and disbursements. The
account snows that the estate, which one
year ago was valued at $5000, now has a
balance of $32 to its credit. The widow
says the funds have been handled by At
torney Albert J. Sherer. Of the $75 month
ly allowance awarded by the Probate
Court she says she received barely $200 in
a year. She testified that she could ob
tain from the estate barely enough to live
on.
A short time ago the livery stable was
sold for $1900. Of this sum the $32 re
ferred to now remains. Mrs. McDermott
says Sherer, who handled the funds, told
her that the money went ior the deDts
and expenses of the livery stable.
Attorney Zach Montgomery, represent
ing Bishop Montgomery, this morning filed
In the Superior Court a sensational at
tack upon the report of the special admin
istrator. Bishop Montgomery's objections
to the account are based on the grounds
first, that the money alleged to have been
paid out on various items was never paid
at allâ that the account is false.
Mrs. Mary E. Murdock, sister of the de
ceased. In the spring of 1898 filed a con
test to the probate of William McDer
mott's will, alleging that Mrs. Carrie Mc-
Dermott was not in fact the legal wife
of William McDermott. She alleged that
at the time of her marriage to McDer
mott she had another husband living.

White Barbers of Marysville to
Operate but Or^e Large

Â© MARYSVILLE, May 12.â There is a movement on foot in this city, 9
O with the leading tonsorial artists as the promoters, to form a barbers' fi
Â§ trust. g
_* The proprietors of the principal shops and the men who work for Â«
fi them propose to incorporate a stock company, with the place of busi- #
{$ ness centrally located in Marysville. Its purpose will be shaving, hair- g
55 cutting and shampooing of, the male population, without regard to creed, Â§
fi race, or previous condition of servitude. ' fi
Â§ ' It is proposed to petition the powers that be to place a license of $50 %
S a month on the business of harboring in Marysville. By this means it m
Â« Is expected to crush the smaller fry, who might otherwise feel moved to fi
â¢3 begin operations on an independent plan. 9
fi \lt is estimated that fourteen of the leading white barbers of this 3
Â§ city will- get together, and that the colored operators also will com- Â§
85 bine, giving the town two big shops and an extra revenue of $1200 per 8$
fi annum. The capital stock of these proposed trusts is as yet a dark se- Â«
Â§ cret, but the companies will be regularly organized with all necessary oftl- Â§
85 clals. Each man will work on the commission plan of 60 cents on the dol- 8$
fi lar. The other 40 cents, after the paying of expenses, will be divided as &

*
The Affair Ended With an Over

Confidence in the Gov

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, May 12.â At a sitting of the
Cabinet Council in the palace of the
Elysee to-day. the President, M. Loubet,
on the suggestion of the Minister of War,
M. Camllle Krantz, signed a decree cen
suring Major Cuignet on account of his
having divulged to the Petit Journal the
contents of certain letters.
In the Chamber of Deputies to-day M.
Rene Ylvianl, Radical Socialist, ques
tioned the Government regarding the let
ters published in the Petit Journal. In
reply M. Krantz said M. Cuignet came
voluntarily to him and confessed he
gave the letters to a friend, who had
communicated them to the Petit Journal.
M. del Casse, Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, said the letters as published were
garbled and mutilated. Among mingled
cheers and hisses, M. del Casse explained
his own position in the matter, and as
serted that Major Cuignet, as a member
of the War Office, had impugned the good
faith of the Foreign Office in certain mat
ters. He (M. del Casse) therefore wrote
to M. de Freycinet. the then Minister of
War, asking apologies for the War Of
fice and showing that Major Cuignet's ac
cusations were unfounded.
The impression gained from M. del
Casse's speech was that M. de Freycinet
resigned the war portfolio instead of
making reparation. The discussion in the
Chamber ended with a vote of confidence
in the Governmentâ 3B9 to 64. - V
In the course of his speech M.
del Casse declared that in reply
to his demand for reparation Major
Cuignet wrote regretting the publicity
given his statement, but declining to
withdraw It. M. del Casse then demanded
that translations of the Panzardissl tele
grama should be submitted to the Court
of Cassation in order that that tribunal
might determine which was correct. M.
del Casse protested against the charg3
of having dictated M. Paleologue's evi
dence and said he had only desired that
M. Pairologue prove to the court the good
faith of the Foreign Office. The trans
lation made for the Foreign Office was
covi'terslgned by M. Chanoine, Major
Cuignet and M. ' Paieologue.
It was this statement, M. del Casse con
tinued, which the Foreign Office sent to
the Ministry of War, and therefore Major
Cuignet's charge was a gratuitous false
hood, as he had himself admitted the cor
rectness of the Foreign Office's transla
tion by countersigning it.
The Nationalist Deputy Lasiez has sent
seconds to M. del Casse to demand ex
planations for the hitter's statements in
the Chamber of Deputies yesterday with
reference to M. Lasiez's attacks, to the
effect that he spurned them with his toes,
although that was more than they de
served. M. del Casse informed M. Lasiez's
seconds that he had nothing to add to
his previous remarks, and that he de
clined to appoint seconds.
M. Gross jean, a Judge of the Versailles
court and an intimate friend of Major
Cuignet, has been cited to appear before
the Superior Council of the magistracy
to-morrow to explain his participation in
the divulging of letters published in the
Petit Journal.
The Paris correspondent of the Daily
Chronicle says: Sensational announce
ments regarding the preparations for the
return of Dreyfus to France toward the
end of next month continue; but the story
that ten members of the Republican
Guard and four gendarmes left Saint
Nazare on Tuesday for French Guiana to
escort him -back lacks authentication as
yet.
WARDNER PRISONERS
ARE BADLY TREATED
SALT LAKE, Utah, May 12.â The West
ern Labor Union and the Federation of
Western Miners held meetings to-day at
10 a. m. and 2 p. m. No business of public
Importance was transacted. The labor
union is still working on constitution and
by-laws and Is not nearly through with
this subject.
In the miners' meeting the committee
on by-laws completed its report, which
was adopted. The committee on griev
ances recommended changes in the card
system so that the back of the card
should show how much each holder had
paid to his union; that is, it should Indi
cate his standing.
Attorney Walter A. Jones Is here to
consult with the miners' federation con
cerning the defense of the 800 or 1000
miners under arrest in the Coeur d'Alene
mining district, charged with various
crimes, from arson to murder. He says
the condition of the prisoners is deplor
able. .There were fifteen boxcars full of
men on a sidetrack last Saturday night
when he left, and 400 or more were hud
dled in a barn.
WALLACE, Idaho. May 12.â County
Commissioners Boyle and Stimson,
charged with complicity In the recent
riots, have applied for a writ of habeas
corpus and Judge Mayhew will hear ar
guments Monday. Many have expressed
the opinion that without a declaration of
martial law by the President, the county
officers continue in pow r er. This case is
brought to settle the point. To-morrow
an order of Judge Mayhew for a special
term of the District Court to convene on
May 29 will be published. Impeachment
proceedings against the county officers
will come up first and the cases against
the alleged rioters later.

off nor endangered at any time since
the adjournment of the commission. If
matters proceed as smoothly as they
are at present proceeding here Sir
Julian Pauncefote's return to Washing
ton will be signalized by the conclusion
of a treaty embracing every question
in dispute in a manner honorable and
pleasing to the two countries."
Due notice has been taken by the
officials here of the semi-official declar
ation from London respecting the
chances for the conclusion of a treaty
that will settle all of the questions at
issue 'between the United States and
Canada. All that can be said is that
the administration will be extremely
gratified if Sir Julian Pauncefote re
turns to the United States with instruc
tions which will meet the difficulties
which baffled the first committee, for,
as matters stand, it is realized that
nothing can be expected to result from
further meeting of the commission.
The statement that negotiations are
to be deferred until the return of Sir
Julian Pauncefote to Washington is re
garded as significant. It confirms fully
the original statement that the com
mission cannot meet until August next,
but the Embassador's return to this
country was set for autumn.
The dispatch also appears to convey
an intimation that the British Govern
ment has about reached the conclusion
that the only method by which these
vexatious issues can be adjusted is by
direct negotiations between the repre
sentatives of the governments of Great
Britain add the United States.
The parties to the negotiations up to
this point have expressed perfect con
fidence in their ability to reach a satis
factory agreement between themselves
in a very short period of time if allowed
to do what they believe right, so they
will be glad to be relieved of the inter
vening forces. "â ;â  'â â :., 'â -â

SAN JOSE NORMAL
SCHOOL SHAKE-UP
Changes Likely to Be Made When the
New Board of Trustees Takes
Charge.
SAN JOSE. May 12.â A1l kinds of rumors
are afloat about the disposal of patronage
in the State Normal School and Agnews
Asylum now that Governor Gage has
made his appointments for these two in
stitutions. The naming of Frank Short
of Fresno, F. J. Leavitt of Oakland,
George W. Pierce of Davisville and Dr.
H. C. Brown and George Sweigert of this
city as Normal Trustees means a shaking
up in the school. Professor C. W. Childs.
who was removed by ex-Governor Budd
from the princlpalshlp, will undoubtedly
be given his old position. Professor Ran
dall, who succeeded Childs, must go. as
will two or three of the teachers. While
the trustees were named to suit "Boss"
I Rea, it is said most of them are pledged
to Childs. There are two others who have
; been mentioned for the principalship of
j the schoolâ A. E. Shumate, principal of
| the local high school, and Maurice Daily
of Fresno. Childs is a member of the
Republican Good Government League,
and this is about all the reward that or
; ganization will receive at the hands of
; Gage.
Adolph Greeninger, who is named to
j succeed Frank Gould as manager in the
; Agnews Asylum board, is one of the most
! prominent men in the county. For over
twenty years he served as Supervisor, and
his appointment meets general approval.
j Politicians, however, claim his appoint
; ment is a victory for Rea, as Greeninger
will side with Trustees Hale and Curnow,
whose connection with the "gang" is well
established. In that case Trustees White
and Upham will have little patronage to
divide. Dr. Sponogle probably will be re
â¢ tamed as medical director.

SUGGESTS THAT A FUND
BE RAISED FOR DEWEY
NEW YORK, May 12.â New
York Times in an editorial entitled
"What Shall We Do for Dewey?" to
morrow will say:
What shall we do for the man who has
dons much for up That Is the question
which has for a long time been agitating
the American people. It Is quite true
that, according to our precedents, we
have not been niggardly In recognition
of the great services of "Commodore"
Dewey, as he was a year ago. But there i
is a persistent and prevailing feeling that
we ought to do more; that the Ameri
can nation in some unofficial and sponta
neous way should recognize the services
of Dewey as the British nation recognized
the services of Wellington when it pre
sented him with the estate of Strathfield- â 
say. Evidently it will not do to make up :
any "exclusive" acknowledgment of the
services of an American hero, to whom
all Americans feel equally grateful. Evi
dently it will not do to leave him at the I
mercy of a group of millionaires, Evl- j
dently it will not do to exclude from the
national testimonial to the admiral any
American citizen who desires to bear his
part In it. Why not appeal directly to
the public through its immediate organs
and agents, the newspapers, which get
their living by representing Its senti
ments?
There are some 20,000 periodicals in the i
United States which are entitled to trans
mission as such through the malls.
Among them are 2119 daily papers, which
represent most immediately and most ac
curately the sentiment of the United
States. Let us assume that only a fourth
part of thes<- are In a position to act as ;
collecting and distributing agents for a
national Dewey testimonial, and that
each one of those 500 is willing to pledge
Itself to the collection from Its readers
nnd the transmission to the appointed
trustees of the sum of $500 for that fund.
Surely this estimate is moderate enough
and surely the amount of each Individual
subscription, which must be strictly fixed
and limited. Is moderate enough to pre- j
vent any newspaper from exploiting the
admiral for the purpose of advertising
Itself. And yet the aggregate of the sub

DEWEY WILL RETURN

0 My Dear Sir: I am In receipt of your telegram with regard to the return
X of Admiral Dewey and expressing your desire that he come home by way of

5 been fixed, and the department has taken no other action than t<r authorize
â â¦â¢ his return whenever the conditions of the Peace Commission shall permit.
0 As to the route he shall take in returning the department is inclined to leave
*> it to him. He has served with such great ability and must necessarily feel

scriptions would be $250,000. Half of this
should go to the erection of a residence
for the admiral in whatever place In the
United States he might prefer to put It,
and the other half for his personal use.
As a matter of fact we believe that
more than the number of periodicals we
have named would be willing and eager
to be included in the project. There is no
reason why the aggregate should not be
correspondingly increased, with the rig
orous limitation of each individual sub
scription to $500, so that there should be
no taint of self-seeking or of advertising
in the affair. This would be truly a na
tional and popular subscription. The admi
ral would not be at liberty to refuse it,
since it would not be the creation of an
obligation on bis part, but only the rec
ognition of an obligation on the part of
the nation. He would not be able to re
fuse it if the whole amount were depos
ited, as it could and should.be deposited,
subject to his order, before his arrival
upon his native shores. ;'â¢';
The President of the United States, the
Secretary of State and the Secretary of
the Treasury would be appropriate cus
todians of the fund and their willingness
to assume its custody may be taken for
granted.
ADMIRAL WATSON WILL
SAIL NEXT TUESDAY
WASHINGTON, May 12.â Admiral
Watson will sail from San Francisco
next Tuesday as a passenger on one
of the regular Pacific Mail steamships,
but cannot possibly reach Manila be
fore the middle of June. Orders have
been issued placing Captain A. S. Bar
ker in command of the Asiatic sauad
ron after Admiral Dewey's departure
until relieved by Rear Admiral Wat
son.
Captain Barker is now ln command
of the battleship Oregon, the pride of
the navy, and next to Admiral Dewey
is the senior officer on the station. He
is an officer of ability and discretion
and may be depended on to take good j
care of the interests of the United
States. He was assistant chief of the
Bureau of Navigation during Admiral
Ramsey's term of office and a member j
of the naval war or strategy board
during the Spanish war. At the close j
of the war he relieved Captain Clark j
of command of the battleship Oregon
and took that magnificent warship j
from New York around the Horn j
to Callao, Peru, and thence by
way of Honolulu to Manila, where she
arrived several weeks ago. As soon as
relieved of the command of the Asiatic
squadron by Rear Admiral Watson,
about the middle of June, Captain Bar
ker will start for home under a leave
of absence granted a few days ago.

WILL CARE FOR
THEIR OWN DEAD
President's Suggestion
Declined.
â â¢ â
CHARLESTON, S. C, May 12.â With
a spirited and at times stormy session
the ninth annual reunion of the United
Confederate Veterans' Association was
to-day brought to a close. General
John B. Gordon, commander-in-chief,
and all the old officers were re-elected.
Louisville, Ky., was chosen as the next
place of meeting and the question of
Federal care of Confederate graves was
disposed of by the adoption of a sub
stitute resolution which declines the
President's suggestion, except as to
those graves located in the North, and
reserving to the women of the South
the duty of caring for those in the se
ceding States and Maryland. The
adoption of this resolution and the re
port that accompanied it precipitated
a debate which verged upon the sensa
tional, and at times much confusion
and disorder prevailed.
General Stephen D. Lee presented
the report of the committee on history,
which was unanimously adopted. This
was one of the most important matters
before the convention and the reading
of the report was listened to with close
attention. The report alluded to the
war with Spain as a factor in eradicat
ing the shadows of the war between
the States. It refers to the prompt
response of the Southern States to the
call for troops as showing to the whole
country the depth and fervor of South
ern patriotism. Continuing the report
says :
President McKinley displayed the spirit
of the American soldier when he chose
from bis former foes the gallant Wheeler,
the steadfast Fitzhugh Lee. the chivalrous
Butler and many others of our own
brave comrades, to marshal the hosts of
the Union. We are glad General Wheeler
had another opportunity to exhibit the
righting qualities of the Confederate sol
diers and that Lieutenant Hobson, Lieu
tenant Blue and Ensign Worth Bagley
In the navy showed the country of what
stuff our young men are made. Once more
the blood of the North and the South has
been poured out togetherâ no longer be
neath contending standards in the bitter
ness of war between the States, but now
beneath one Hag, to the glory of the
country. These dead, at least, belong to
us all. The last hateful memory that
could divide our country is buried with
them. About their graves kneels a new
nation, loving all her children everywhere
the same.
Alluding to the question of Confed
erate graves the report says:
The recent generous words of President
McKinley commending the Confederate
dead to the nation's care, are the expres
sions of a sentiment growing everywhere
that the deeds of the Confederate soldier
are the glory of the whole country, and
that his memory is worthy to be cherished
wherever self-sacrifice commands sym
pathy or brave actions strike a respon
sive chord in noble hearts.
The committee also alludes to the
race question and expresses the opinion
that the "race problem is not apt in
the future to be so blinding to a true
apprehension of Southern history," and
says:
"The recent movement to put the
supremacy of the more educated and
capable race upon a constitutional and
legal basis, thus banishing the specter
of misrule from our borders, is steadily
gaining progress." Continuing the re
port says:
The reception given our benevolent In
tentions in the Philippines is certainly of
a character likely to inspire a wholesome
respect. We are not likely in the future
to hear so much about the right of men
who have not yet learned to govern them
selves to govern others by their votes.
The doctrine of the Declaration of Inde
pendence, that governments derive their
just powers from the consent of the gov
erned, had something of a shock in the
war between the States, and the island
subjects of the United States will find lit
tle comfort in reading that celebrated in
strument by the light of subsequent his
tory. The difficulties of the race prob
lem abroad ought to bring a charitable
judgment of the same thing here at home,
and we may reasonably expect our North
ern brethren to meet us hereafter rather
in a spirit of inquiry than of rebuke. â â :- Â»-;
The convention adjourned sine die at
2:15 p. m.
Td-night at the Auditorium a grand
reception to the veterans was held and
an address was delivered by Colonel
Henry L. Turner of Chicago, command
ing the First Illinois Regiment. Colonel
Turner has been the guest of the city
during the reunion. A brilliant ball
was given to the sponsors, maids of
honor and daughters of the' Confe
deracy. The veterans and visitors . are
rapidly departing.

ished eating he arose and demanded
that Mrs. Silvera produce all the money
and jewels on the premises. A refusal
infuriated the ruffian, who sprang upon
Mrs. Silvera and choked her. She was
then dragged out the front door and
hurled from the porch to the ground.
Despite her bruises, the plucky woman
ran back into the house after her as
sailant, who was opening the drawers
of a bureau. With an oath he struck
her on the face, felling her to the floor.
She was again dragged into the yard
and left lying unconscious.
When Silvera returned home thirty
minutes later he found his wife hardly
able to move on account of her bruised
condition, while her cheek was discol
ored from the blow. A physician was
summoned and the authorities notified,
but so far no trace of the malefactor
has been discovered. It is believed that
he is an ex-convict who has been plant
ing opium along the line of the new
Tiburon boulevard, as his description
tallies with that of the man seen skulk
ing in the brush near San Clemente the
j day Captain Birlem's men detected two
i convicts attempting to smuggle the
I drug into San Quentin Prison. The mi
i dignation aroused by the assault and
attempted robbery is so strong that if
the criminal is captured he will be in
i danger of summary punishment.
EAGER TO LEAVE
KOTZEBUE SOUND
Sad Experience of Gold
Seekers.
â Â« â
SKAGUAY, May 5 (via Seattle, May
12.)â Fysh and W. Williams
reached Dawson on April 15 on foot
from Kotzebue Sound. Fysh and Wil
liams formed two of a party of eight
een who left lowa last summer and
joined the big rush which landed 2000
people on the various rivers of Kotze
bue Sound. The party established win
ter .quarters 300 miles up the Kowak
River. After untold hardships and la
bor, they decided that there was no
gold in the country. On February 19
Fysh and Williams struck out over the
divide to Koyukuk, thence to Dawson,
a distance of 1500 miles.
Mr. Fysh reports that Kotzebue
Sound is thickly peopled with an intelli
gent race of Indians closely resembling
the Japanese in habits and physique.
The principal diet heretofore has been
dried salmon, but the abundance of
white man's food last summer was the
cause ef laying away less than half a
crop of salmon. The result this winter
was that the illy nourished natives
have been dying' off like sheep. He
says the opening of the Bering Sea
will see the exodus of the last white
man and only a scattering of cabins
will mark the scene of one of the most
disastrous gold hunting expeditions
since Cortes landed on the coast of
Florida.

Action of Land-Owner Dreyfus in
Blocking Construction Is De

â ' Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, May 12.â The
Southern Pacific coast" line right of way
through the great'Holllst^- estate, that
is one obstacle responsible for the em
bargo that C. P. Huntington threatens
to put on railroad building, hinges on
the willingness of the railroad people
to pay $4400 to construct an archway
over a roadway on â  the Santa Anita
ranch. J. T. Richards, attorney and
trustee of the estate, in a written state
ment says the Southern Pacific has
been given twenty-five miles of right
of way over the ranch on condition that
it will build this archway to enable pas
sage from one side of the road to the
other. .There will be a deep fill, prob
ably forty feet, near the ranch house,
and it is under this that the arch is
wanted. The railroad people have re
fused flatly to build the arch, but fall
back on the Santa Barbara County
right of way committee to settle the
dispute and give them free passage
through the county, the Hollister es
tate included. Members of the Hollis
ter family declare they will not yield
to the demands of Huntington, as the
damage to the property will be far
greater than the cost of building the
arch, and twenty-five miles of right of
way over the lands is estimated to be
worth $10,000, which they have agreed
i to give.
In answer to the Morning Press tele
gram to C. P. Huntington, asking
whether or not the report was true that
work had been stopped, the following
I message was received late this even
ing:
Morning Press, Santa Barbara: No
truth in the report.
C. . P. HUNTINGTON.
The Southern Pacific Company, al
though threatening to discontinue the
work of construction, has had almost a
full force at work all day. The com
pany's officials here have circulated re
ports that it is due to the actions of
Louis G. Dreyfus and the Hollister es
tate that Huntington is about to sus
pend work. They to-day . made public
the Dreyfus letter to their contractors
and give it out that unless Dreyfus
came to their terms the road would
stop at his property three miles north
west of Ell wood. Dreyfus' letter reads:
You are hereby cautioned against tres
passing on my property, the Eagle Can
yon rancho, and you are notified not to
enter thereon. The Southern Pacific
Company nor any other company ha's no
right of way across the said property,
where the surveyors of said company
have surveyed a route for a railroad bed.
You are also notified not to cross any of
the said lands, unless proper authority be
obtained from me, nor to attach your
stock to any fencing on the premises, nor
to camp on any part of the property, or
on the county road crossing - the said
property, which road Is my property, ex
cepting for the purposes of a road to be
used by the general public. If you dis
regard this notice you are notified that
you will be held responsible for all dam
ages.
This letter was forwarded to railroad
headquarters on May 8, and immediate
ly letters came from Huntington to th<Â»
right of way committee here. Dreyfus'
action has been the sole topic of con
versation on the streets to-day and sev
eral attempts to hold an indignation
meeting have been made, although not
successful. This evening Dreyfus,
when seen by The Call correspondent,
again denied that he had in any way
hindered the company. He said its at
torney called on him several weeks ago
in regard to the right of way through
his property and he gave his terms,
which have, all been ignored by the
company, He has received no com
munication from the railroad â¢ officials
up to this time. * . \
Public opinion is against Dreyfus, but
at the same time it . considers that
Huntington is attempting a big bluff on
the people.
GARDNER AND FLAHERTY
r^IGHT TO A DRAW
Though Badly Handicapped, the
"Omaha Kid" Makes the Bet
ter Showing.
NEW YORK, May 12.â Oscar Gardner,
the "Omaha Kid," and Martin Flaherty
of Lowell, Mass., fought a 25-round draw
at the New Broadway Athletic Club to
night in the presence of a crowd that
packed the auditorium and held overflow
meetings in the aisles and entries. It was
an unsatisfactory fight from the stand
point of the spectators, for there was a
sameness about the tactics of the men
throughout and flashes of brilliancy were
infrequent. Gardner was the cleverer,
man of the two and outboxed his oppo
nent at every stage of the game. He was
handicapped, however, in that he had an
unhealed cut over his left eye and came
into the ring with a big bandage around
his head. In action the bandage slipped
down and until he took it off he was at
times playing bllndman's buff. Later In
the contest the cut was reopened and bled
so freely that his left eye was at -times
blinded. He also seemed to show the ef
fect of too much fighting of late, for he
lacked the dash and vim that have
brought him so many victories.
Flaherty had the advantage of height,
weight and reach and made the pace in
most of the rounds, but his work was in
effective. He constantly over-reached and
looked wild alongside of the little man,
who was generally inside his punches or
under them. He displayed a very dan
gerous left hand, but lacked Judgment of
distance to make It useful. -â¢ â¢ j

Interesting Notes.
Major General Merriam, U. S. A., Is
unpopular with the labor union? through- j
out the country .sine his edict against
the employment of union miners in the
famous Coeur I'Alene mining district. On
Thursday evening the Building Trades
'Council decided to make an Investigation
'into the troubles at Wardner, Idaho, with
a view to fixing the blame for the recent
troubles, and It also condemned the gen
eral for his action ln accusing union min
ers of being guilty of all the lawless
ness.
The Labor Council at Its weekly session
last evening followed In the footsteps of
Its afflicted organization. I: was unani
mously agreed that a committee draw tip
resolutions "condemning the. expressions
of General Merrlam, classifying labor or
ganizations as criminal conspiracies, and
protesting against the order Issued by
him prohibiting the employment of union
men in th Coeur d'Alene mines."
The motion was introduced by A. Fu
ruseth of the Sailors' Union; and In mak
ing it he delivered a warm speech, crit
icizing General Merrlam and the admin
istration. I*. H. McCarthy and a num
ber of other members followed In fiery
speeches along the same line. The reso
lutions will be adopted at the next meet
ing and will be published broadcast
throughout the United States In labor
journals and other periodicals, in the
nope that it may arouse the union labor
ers to an appreciation of the "unfair
irr-atment accorded them by General Mer
riam."'
Secretary Rosenberg" was Instructed to
communicate with the Treasury Depart
ment and ask that the request or the
Mechanics' Institute to land Filipinos in
this city for exhibition purposes be de
nied.
A delegate from the Sailors' Union re
ported that business was improving along
the water front; that nearly four-fifths
of the vessels leaving port are employing
sailors at union wages, and that the police
do not understand the law recently passed
which permits a sailor to leave a vessel
at his own pleasure. Attention was also
called to Serjeant Bonner's advice to of
ficers of various vessels anchored in the
stream to tire on any boat that came
alongside their ship for the purpose of
taking men off. The delegate further said
there was every indication that all ship
owners would bo compelled to pay union
rates this summer.
The Sailors' Union requested that the
Labor Council have its secretary commu
nicate with the Miners' Union at Nanai
mo, B. C., and ascertain what arrange
ments can be made to have coal carried
exclusively by ships employing union men.
This will be attended to at once.
A large amount of business was trans
acted by the council before adjournment.
Carpenters' Union No. reinitiated eight
new members last night and also d.s
cussed General Merrlam and the admin

ANOTHER FRAUD
ON THE REVENUE
COMES TO LIGHT
Internal Revenue Agents Thomas and
Towne have unearthed another gigantic
fraud against the Government on the
part of unscrupulous cigar manufacturers
in New York. New Jersey and Pennsylva
nia. The fraud does not consist in the use
of counterfeit revenue cigar' stamps, and
hence must have been going on for a long
time, the stamp* being genuine and there
being nothing about the boxes to attract
suspicion.
About a week ago Mr. Thomas discov
ered that certain manufacturers were dis
tributing throughout the United States
sample boxes containing twenty-sir and
fifty-one cigars each, the stamps on the
boxes being for twenty-five and fifty each,
thus defrauding the Government out of
the tax on one cigar in each box, or out
of forty in each thousand cigars. The
Government woul<J not suffer much if the
number of these boxes was not large, but
when it runs into the tens of thousands
distributed over every Stale in the Union
it is a serious matter.
It is apparent that no manufacturer
would care to run the risk of detection in
a fraud of this kindâ the risk involving
the confiscation of his factory and of his
entire stock â merely to save a few dollars.
The saving must have run up into the
thousands.
.The agents began their seizures a day
or two ago and succeeded ln getting 6000
cigars ln Los Angeles. They are on the
track of othoTs in this city and expect
to round up many more thousands to-day.
Mr. Thomas was the- first person to
make this important discovery and he im
mediately wired to the head of the reve
nue department in Washington and there
are Indications that within the next few
days seizures will be made in every State

The way is clear for the eradication of
the greatest , evil of Chinatownâ the
breeder of all other evils in that quarter.
In a letter mailed yesterday to M. M. i
Foote, who is secretary of the Vigilant I
Society, Mayor Phelan admits that "it is
made the duty of certain city officers, in- I
eluding the Mayor, to give notice to all I
violators of the act approved March 31,
1566, for the suppression of Chinese houses
of 111-fame." He adds that he will be !
pleased to comply with Mr. Foote's re- '
quest and give the required notice on re
ceipt of the Information Mr. Foote is un
derstood to possess concerning the loca
tion, the ownership and the inmates of
such houses.
The information the Mayor desires will
be furnished,, although Mr. Foote says it
could just as easily be obtained by the
city's executive and the Chief of Police,
who Is also called upon to move under
the act, by applying to any member of
the Chinatown squad. In the same spirit,
however, he says, as that in which he
wrote the letter to the Mayor pointing out
an evil' that that official should know ex
isted and indicating the law that provided
for its eradication, he will gladly furnish
Mr. Phelan with a List of the houses of
prostitution in Chinatown, the names of
their inmates and the owners. It will
remain then, he says, for the Mayor and
the Chief of Police to move under the law,
or to be moved by writ of mandamus un
der the law. The. Mayor says in his reply
to Mr. Foote'that he will act as required.
Chief Lees, who has not been officially
informed of any complaint against the
dens in Chinatown, which he does not
deny exist, refuses to say what he will do.
"You know what I'll do when the time
comes," he said last night to a reporter
for The CalL v, . â¢ . . :;
No matter what the Chief does, the in
formation that the Mayor has signified his
willingness to accept will be forthcoming
ln a few days, as soon as the agents of
the Vigilant . Society make their reports
to the directory,' and In as short a, time as
possible it will -be turned over to thÂ«i
Mayor, who will undoubtedly be as good
as his - word' and serve on the proprietors
and inmates of the one hundred and fifty
odd dens warnings to vacate, at the same
time notifying the property owners that
unless ' their' -premises are purged of the
evil they will be liable to criminal prose
cution. Then will come the turn of the
Chief of Police. If the slaveholders ignore
the notices and the owners of the -prop
erty in which the dens are located refuse
to obey the law It will be the duty of
Chief Lees tee awake to a law that gov
erns him and to do his duty long neg
lected. He must either Issue orders for
the arrest of the proprietors of the houses
and the inmates and must Bee that they
are arrested or he will be dragged into
court himself.
That is the status to-day of the recently
Inaugurated crusade against the dens of
vice where highbinders breed and where
murder Is plotted. At the headquarters
of the Vigilant Society In the Sherman
block there is rejoicing over the fact that
a law, no matter how innocuous from dis
use, needs only to be dusted to be ef
fective.

The resolutions presented the day before
as to. endeavors to secure further power
from the Sovereign Grand Lodge to en
able the Rebekah division of Odd Fellow
ship "to obtain recognition on the floor of
that body and to be able to legislate as to
benefits were adopted.
It was decided to reduce the age of ad
mission to the Orphans' Home at Gilroy
from 16 to 14 years. It was also decided
to- give the authorities of the home au
thority to return to guardians any chil
dren who might be ungovernable. There
are none such there now, but this action
was taken to guard against possibilities.
A resolution was offered having for its
purpose a. reduction of the basis of repre
sentation to the assembly. Action will be
taken on that to-day.
A motion to allow mileage to delegates
was lost. , v :
The Cooper Inquest.
Coroner Hill began an inquest yester
day morning Into the cause of the death
of Joseph Cooper, the Powell-street tailor
who was asphyxiated in his bed last Mon
day night. Mrs. Phcbe Abrams, Bessie
Cooper and Joseph Cooper, children of
the deceased, testified as to the finding
of their father's body.
The stopcock of the gasjet was partly
turned on and it was loose, thus giving
strong color to the. theory that the death
was accidental. Dr. Josef I. Monson tes
tified that he had been attending the de
ceased for several months for heart dis
ease, and believed that he had died from
that ailment.
Morgue Surgeon Zabala said that the
autopsy revealed the fact that death was
due to asphyxiation. The Inquest will be
resumed this morning.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 13, 1899.
TRIED TO END
HIS EXISTENCE
WITH A RAZOR
Major J. J. Barnett in
Trouble.
â â¦
NO MONEY AND NO PROSPECTS
â Â» â
ONE TIME PROMINENT IN THE
BUCKLEY BANKS.
*
Eight Years Ago He Was One of the
Principal Actors in a Tragedy
That Has Weakened His
Mind.
â¢
Major J. J. Barnett, an old-time politi
cian, attempted yesterday morning to
commit suicide at 1117 Broadway, where
he resides with some friends, by slashing
his left wrist six times with a razor. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital in
the patrol wagon and his wounds were
attended to. Barnett said that if his
friend had not discovered him while he
was slashing his wrist he would have
killed himself. He was tired of life, as he
was without money and had no prospect
of earning any.
"I am a lifelong friend of Chris BncTt
ley," he Bald, "and previous to the last
election I went to Buckley and asked him
to use his influence to get me a position.
He said he would, but I was not success
ful. I called upon him a few days ago
and again asked him to look out for me
after the next election, but he did not
give me any hope of success, and I con
cluded the best thing for me was to die."
As. Barnett was very weak from the
loss of blood ho was prevailed upon to
remain in the hospital until something
could lie done by his friends for him.
Barnett was one of the principal actors
in a tragedy about eight years ago. He
and May Castree, a handsome woman of
the town, were infatuated with each
other and one night after they had been
to supper and had gone to the woman's
room over a saloon on Mason street, the
woman saton his knee and suggested that
they should both die. They talked the
â  matter over and finally Barnett consent
ed. He had a revolver In his pocket and
after they had taken an affectionate fare
well of each ether Barnett placed the
muzzle of the revolver over the woman's
heart and. fired, killing her instantly. He
then placed the weapon over his own
' heart and fired, but the bullet missed the
i fatal spot by the fraction of an inch. He
' did not recover for several months, and
when he did lie was arrested on the
I charge of murder. After a trial before a
| jury in the Superior Court he was ac
; quitted. Since then he has not been In
| exactly his right mind, it is thought from
I brooding over the tragedy.

HPHE pleasant method and beneficial effects of the well-known remedy, Syrup op Figs, manufactured
-*â¢ by the California Fig Syrup Company, illustrate the value of obtaining the liquid laxative principles
of plants known to be medicinally laxative and presenting them in the form most refreshing to the taste
and acceptable to the system. It is the one perfect strengthening laxative,
CLEANSING THE SYSTEM EFFECTUALLY, DISPELLING
COLDS AND HEADACHES, PREVENTING FEVERS,
OVERCOMING HABITUAL CONSTIPATION PERMANENTLY.
Its perfect freedom from every objectionable quality and substance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, gently yet promptly, without weakening or irritating them, make it the ideal laxative:
In the process of manufacturing figs are used, as they are pleasant to the taste, but
THE MEDICINAL QUALITIES ARE OBTAINED FROM SENNA AND OTHER AROMATIC PLANTS,
by a method known to the CaliforniaJFig Syrup Company only. In order to get its beneficial effects, and
to avoid imitations, please. remember the full hame of the Company printed on the front of every package.
Consumers of the choicest products of modern commerce purchase at about the same price that others
pay for cheap and worthless imitations. To come into universal demand and to be everywhere considered
'he best of its class, an article must be capable of satisfying the wants and tastes of the best informed
purchasers. The California Fig Syrup Company having met with the highest success in the manufacture
md sale of its excellent liquid laxative remedy, $yrup OP Figs, it has become important to all to have a
knowledge of the Company and. its product. j] The California Fig; Syrup Company was organized more thai'
rifteen years ago, for the spe-cial purpose of manufacturing an 4 selling a laxative remedy which would b<
' more pleasant to the taste mor^ bene^cial inspect than any other known. The great value of th<
remedy, as a medicinal agent ana of â¢ .he Company^ efforts, is attested by the sale of millions of bottle^
annually, and by the high approval* of most eminent physicians. As the true and genuine remedy named
Syrup op Figs is.iauufactured by the California Fig Syrup Company only, the knowledge of that fact
will assist in avoiding the worthless' imitations manufactured by other parties. --

MB. HUNTINGTON'S BANQUET.
Will Entertain His Fourteen Heads
of Departments To-Night.
C. P. Huntington will be host to-night
at a banquet to be tendered the fourteen
heads of departments by whom he was
entertained at the Palace two weeks ago,
and their assistants. The affair is to take
place at Mr. Huntington's California
street residence and promises to be one of
the swellesl affairs of the season.
To-night's affair will probably be Mr.
Huntington's last appearance at an event
of this sort during his present stay in the
city. His annual trip has already been
drawn out to a greater length than he had
anticipated, as has been the visit of Mr.
Speyer, the New York financier, who came
out to attend the annual election of the
Central Pacific directorate. Both of them
will hurry their departure. Mr. Speyer
would have started yesterday but for the
banquet to-night, where he will be one of
the guests of honor. As It Is he will leave
on Sunday and it Is likely that Mr. Hunt
ington will depart at the same time, as a
joint inspection of the Western properties
of the Central and Southern Pacific sys
tems was part of their original itinerary.
Gingerbread Fete Beceipts.
At the last meeting of the board of
managers of the Children's Hospital the
sum of $2800 was reported netted by the
recent gingerbread fete. Out of this $1100
must be expended for fire escapes.

A BAY COLLISION.
, - â¢
The Schooner Volant and the Pilot
Boat Gracie S Bump Each Other
With Bad Results.
The schooner Volant, in command of
Captain Krog, sailed in last night from
Grays Harbor, and when opposite Meiggs
wharf collided with the pilot-boat Gracie
S. which was lying at anchor. The Gracie
B had her Jibboom, headgear, etc., carried
away and sustained a great deal of dam
age on deck.
The Volant, after getting clear of the
pilot-boat, drifted on to Meiggs wharf,
carrying away the boat davits, smashing
several boats and doing considerable
other damage. Tin- Volant had her head
gear, main rigging and mainsail carried
away and also sustained a lot of damage
on deck.
Lieutenant Nash Banqueted.
Lieutenant Nash, who has charge of
the rifle team of the Police Department,
was yesterday banqueted by his sharp
shooters at Shell Mound Park: About
twenty policemen were present* Speeches
were made by Lieutenant Nash. Police
men Phillips and "Mauser" Rankin. The
latter made a decided hit in his latest
creation, "How Mulcahey Lost His Job."
Previous to the banquet the team held its
regular shoot. High scores were made
by the men, showing that they had not
lost their cleverness with the new rifle.

The San Francisco Gas and Electric '
Company has been at last forced into the j
open. Failing to secure from the Board :
of Supervisors a rate for their gas in j
keeping with what they claim is a reason- !
able charge for lighting, the officers of the |
company have had recourse to the courts.
Late yesterday afternoon a complaint
was filed in the office of County Clerk j
Deane against Major W. B. Hooper, man- j
ager of the Occidental Hotel, alleging that j
he is indebted to the gas company for i
Jejol for gas supplied during April at the j
rate of $1 75 per 1030 f-?et.
The attorneys are Bishop & Wheeler, j
with whom is associated E. S. Pillshury, j
for the gas company. Mr. Bishop filed the |
papers himself, selecting apparently a j
time when the reporters had left their
posts of duty for the day. The complaint !
is a purely formal document, giving no j
intimation as to what issues will be made I
during the trial. A creditor owing over j
$.>Â») was selected to the end that the case j
would go at once to the Superior Court,
thus saving all unnecessary delay.
In the meantime the company is collect- j
ing its April bills at the rate of $1 75 per j
1000 feet, although some consumers are j
refusing to pay until the legal rate has
been determined. To placate these the
company is s-tamping upon their bills the
following agreement:
If any less rate than that herein
charged is hereafter adjudged to be
legal this company agrees to refund
the difference.
â¢
Attorney Pillshury of counsel for the
â¢company; affirms that the case will be ex
pedited as much as possible on the part >
of his clients, as they wish to know what ;
is the legal rate they may chars-. It will
be prosecuted vigorously by the brightest
men at the bar, the company making sure
that its case will not suffer in their hands. :
"The filing of the suit against Major
Hooper; manager of the Occidental Hotel, ;
means that the gas company has gone to
the courts to have settled legally and defi
nltely the rate it may charge consumers."
said Attorney E. S. Pillsbury last night, ;
"We will expedite the case as much as lies
in our power, as it is to the interest of the ,
gas company to know the exact status of
the case. Major Hooper was made ilefend
ant because his bill was sufficiently large
to take the case to the Superior Court, i
WILL BE STRENGTHENED
IN THE HEBREW FAITH
THIRTY-NINE APPLICANTS TO
BE CONFIRMED.
I
Beautiful Services Will Be Held at I
the Bush Street Synagogue
Sunday Evening by
Rabbi Myers
Thirty-nine candidates will receive con
firmation at the Bush street Synagogue
next Sunday evening. A particularly
beautiful service has 'been arranged, and
the ceremonies will be very impressive,
from the fact that each of the applicants
will have some specific function to per
form different from the other? in the large
class. The interior of the edifice will oe
handsomely decorated and the music for
the oecasio'n has been composed especially
by Miss Regina Jacobson, recently re
turned from Australia.
This will be the largest number of appli
cants ever confirmed at one time in any
Jewish synagogue on the Pacific Coast.
Originally there were forty-one in the
class, but owing to sickness, two candi
dates. Miss Leah Kaitin and William Wil
liams, will be unable to receive the bless
ings of the sacrament. The reeuiar les
tival service will compose the first part of
the ceremony and will commence at 7
o'clock sharp. It will be conducted by
Cantor D. Meyerson.
Confirmation will begin at half-past 7.
Nt which Rev. Isidore Myers, the rabbi of
the congregation, will officiate. The ran
s.oal prcgiamme will be rendered under
the direction of Professor Dellapiane.
Next Sunday is termed, according to the
Jewish law. the "Feast of Weeks." It is
in commemoration of the anniversary of
the giving of the law on Mount Sinia. and
is known in Hebrew rituals as Shovuos
Sunday.. The day has beÂ« n chosen on ac
count of Its significance for thÂ° adminis
tration of confirmation. The following

OAKLAND. .May 12.â The new nealth
board held its first regular meeting to

present expecting to see the patronage
distributed. A motion by- Dr. Maher that
the matter of patronage be postponed in
definitely was carried. The terms of the
chemist, bacteriologist, sanitary inspec
tors, veterinary surgeon and secretary
having expired their offices can be de
clared vacant and be refilled at any time.

We might have sued on a smaller bill, but
if it were heard in the Justice Court it
would of necessity have to go to a higher
court before being finally accepted.
"The consumers will lose i thing if it
is finally decided that the il 1') rate was
legally fixed. On each bill the company
wii! stamp a promise to refund any dif
ference between the rate paid by a house
holder and that which the court will say
is the rate to which the company is en
titled.
"As to what issues will be brought up
during the trial it is impossible to fore
cast. The main fight will hinge on the
question whether the Supervisors have
authority to fix rates, and if. having the
power to fix them, they have also vested
in them the power to rescind their action.
On April 3 the boar-VfixtHl a rate of $1 10,
and a week later rescinded that action.
This left the rate at the former figures.
$1 75 per thousand feet."
Mr. Pillshury was asked if this was a
"friendly" suit. He laughed and said:
"If you think there is any friendship in
this just go down and interview Major
Hooper. I'll venture to say he is the
angriest man in town. I don't blame him
for refusing to pay the bill. He is man
ager of the hotel and as such is responsi
ble for its affairs being handled in a busi
nesslike manner. He was selected rom a
number of people whose bills for April re
main unpaid."
George K. Hooper, who represents Ma
jor W. B. Hooper, manager of the Occi
dental, was surprised when told of the
filing of the suit. "This is news to me,"
he said. "I know the gas hill was due
and that it had not been paid. Major
Hexiper did not feel justified in paying so
large a bill when there was a e-pieetion as
to the legality of the rate of $1 75 per
thousand feet for which the bill was ren
dered. We have been approached by per
sons who wanted us to join the organiza
tion of people who ha pooled their issues
and were prepared to resist the -collection
of any gas bills rendered for more than
$1 10 per thousand. The persons who
called on us had no credentials and could
not show any list of firms whom they
represented. I do not know why we
should tee singled out above any one else
as the ones en whom the validity of the
recent action of the Supervisors should
be tested. .
"In Justice to ourselves we did not
think It right to pay a bill in which there
was so marked a difference between the
charge made and that .which seemed to
be the legal charge. Like others, we with
held payment until such time as the ques
tion of rates was decided. We surely did
not expect to be defendants in an action
of this character. No Dapers have been
served on us and we do not know how
matters stand."

Native Daughters Present a Novel
Effect in the Art of Decorating.
I. a Est'rella Parlor No. ??. Native
; Daughters of the Golden West, celebrated
its third anniversary last night by ,i grand
ball in Native Sons' Hall. As Usual, this
parlor displayed much artistic decorative
talent and originality in design. The strik
! ing feature of the display was an electric
effect over the stage which was set off
with living plants that concealed â â¢.,- mu
sicians. It was a long hammock of span
' gled tulle on which rested the figure of a
; woman, holding in her uplifted hand a
! blazing star, while from the light were
strings of small electric lights to carry
out the Wees that myriads of stars were
being distributed from the main one.
The grand march was led by William
â¢ Fenstamacher and Miss C. Fensta
! macher, president of the parlor. The
; function was a full dress on.c and the
' programme of dances was carefully pre
pared. The leader of the march was floor

MRS. CRAVEN CONFIDENT OF
ULTIMATE VICTORY.
Judge Denson Makes a Long Argu
ment to Show the Court His
Client's Right to Inter
vene.
~ "-
In the courtroom that has resounded
for months with the voices of the numer
ous counsel in the now celebrated Fair
will case the attorneys gathered again
yesterday, somewhat lessened in numbers
but still fresh, to continue the argument
on Mrs. Nettie K. Craven's application to
be permitted to Intervene for the purpose
of contesting the will of the late James G. j
Fair, dated September 21. 1894, which is
known as the "trust will."
Mrs. Craven was in court all day yes
terday, and took decided interest in the
dry legal arguments of her attorneys, i
Her application is based upon precisely
the same grounds as that filed on behalf â¢
of Charles i.. Fair, the son. It was shown
during the discussion that under the stat- i
ute. after a will has been admitted to pro
bate without contest, any person may in- |
tervene in an action or proceeding: before j
the trial who has an interest in the con
troversy. Charles L. Fair's application j
to move to set aside the probate of the j
will was tiled on the _â â  of November, |
ISS7. which was the last day of the year I
provided by the statute. Since that time
the controversy has remained dormant.
A few weeks ago Mrs. Craven applied
to the court for permission to intervene in
that contest for the pur; of setting
aside the probate of be will of September
21. Judge Troutt. to whom the applica
tion was made, directed service to be |
made upon the attorneys for the heirs and ;
executors, ordering them to show cause, j
if any they had. why the petition should ,
not be filed. Mrs. Craven's application ,
was opposed by the attorneys of all the j
children and of the executors, nd ft was
on this point that the i arguments of j
Thursday and yesterday were made.
In the opening argument authorities j
were presented to how that where the
contest had been kept alive by the action
of Charles L. Fair any one interested in I
the estate would have a right to come in.
The attorneys for the executors and j
children, on the other hand, claim that
Mrs. Craven's right to intervene was
barred by the statute of limitations and :
that her petition was gaily defective
in that it did not state facts sufficient to j
constitute a legal cause of action.

it is as follows:
At such a time, we. as Callfornians, cannot

gold-hunters Invaded a land governed by Span

a condition of affairs arose altogether unpre- ,

often settled by violent means. At this June- i
ture his legislative work, guided by far-sighted <
sagacity, gave the force of law to the cus
toms and usages of the miners, and not only
brought order out of chaos, bat laid the foun- :

c .bach club entering the race names ten

a relay of ten miles of the total hundred

and follows him as best he can read"." to
render assistance if the relay rider is "dis

Each club also has to furnish three men

and thirty competent officials before it
can think of entering the big event. For
this reason many of the smaller clubs
cannot enter teams.

The four teams are about evenly bal

for a non-partisan to choose between

this city the rivalry between the Bay

In past years there have been as many
as 10,000 people present at the finish of
the relay race on the streets of Alameda,
and from the interest taken in this year's
event it seems likely there will be fully
as many there to-morrow.

"JUST LIKE GAGE."
READERS of the interior press just now might
suppose that our Governor had been cut up
into tempting or tempted slices, for the
purpose of frying him over a hot fire is
going on all over the State. It is not
the comparatively modern and delicate system
of grilling that has been adopted, but the old
fashioned method of the pioneer days, and the siz
zling and the sputtering of the hot railroad grease are'
vocalizing and perfuming the air in every direction.
It seems that the Governor determined that the
Huntington leprosy and the smallpox ought not to
be allowed to spread at the same time. Being deeply
infected with the first disease, which had become too
prevalent for immediate extirpation, he addressed
himself to the second and roused up Dr. Matthews,
the president of the Board of Health, late at night so
that before morning he might arrange to check its
advancing march at Fort Yuma. For this extra
labor he received due credit in the expressive words,
"Just like Gage." There may have been some strategy
in this nocturnal visitation, for vaccination, which
successfully resists smallpox, communicates the Hun
tington leprosy in all its forms, including elephan
tiasis, or the swollen corruption of the body and of
the head.
The refrain, "Just like Gage,"' was quickly appro
priated and disseminated. One paper marked the
antithetical exercise of one of his executive functions
when he vetoed a bill allowing our bright women,
among them the Native Daughters of the Golden
West, to vote for School Trustees, and signed an act
legalizing prize-fights. Others criticized his approval
of the anti-cartoon and signature bills, the uncon
stitutionality of which as a lawyer and the absurdity
of which as a citizen he must have well known, as
indeed he admitted when in the face of such legisla
tion he treated the report that he was about to go
into the newspaper business as ridiculous. Still others
resented the "scoop" he gave the Examiner and its
Canadian annex of his intention to appoint Dan
Burns a Senator of the United States if Matt Quay
should be seated. Then, under the heading, among
others, of "Peanut Politics," he was not only fried
but burned for his ostentatious and vulgar rudeness
to Senator Perkins at the Los Angeles celebration of
the San Pedro victory over C. P. Huntington. His
conduct in this particular instance indicated that he
was not quite satisfied with the anti-railroad triumph,
which Senator Perkins was so largely instrumental in
securing. His loyalty to Los Angeles and his affec
tion for C. P. Huntington evidently conflict.
In each instance of this culinary operation the jus
tification of the chef de cuisine was "Just like Gage."
Other things may be also mentioned that are just like
him. His acted confessions of absolute absorption by
the railroad are rapidly accumulating. He began with
the Board of Health. He continued with the Board
of Equalization. Now he has filled the place of Sena
tor Boggs, deceased, on the State Board of Agricul
ture by the appointment of that distinguished farmer
and horticulturist, Grove L. Johnson, whose great
achievements have been the farming of the revenues,
the grafting of Huntington shoots upon the Tree of
State, the pruning of the constitutional rights of citi
zens and of the press, and the application of the rail
road bacilli to the roots of our civilization.
Henry T. Gage is surely a daisy in his particular
line, but the line itself produces a network of slimy
discolorations. He is one of the examples of indi
vidual political suicide. His notoriety has destroyed
his popularity. His influence in the disintegration of
his party and in turning the State over to Democratic
fusion has been prematurely exhausted. Charity,
however, would like to furnish him with a remedy
for his serious ailments. As the surgeons have suc
ceeded in taking reefs in the human stomach, per
haps they might succeed in contracting swelled heads
and replacing coarse brains by mental conductors of
a finer quality. This is apparently the only chance
for our gubernatorial phenomenon.
With Governor Gage sneaking with W. F. Herrin
by a secret door from the Palace Hotel, and Railroad
Commissioners Laumeister. and Blackstock clinking
glasses with the railroad attorney at his home, it be
gins to look as if the Southern Pacific Company, in
all truth, is out of politics and has seized the State
government.
______
The young school teacher of the Shoshone Indian
reservation who drew her revolver upon two men to
defend one of her pupils evidently believed that in
teaching the young idea how to shoot she might take
a few lessons herself.
Railroad Commissioner Laumeister said he would,
in shame, leave the State if he voted for the Black
stock resolution. If he really meant it a suggestion
of how to keep him out would be timely.
. â  . â  'i i
Governor Gage will again take up the "burden of
*Â»ate." Dan Burns has gone to Sacramento.
THE STREET RAILROAD PROBLEM.
THE CALL has placed fairly before the public
the separate proposals of the Market Street
Railway Company and their combined effect, if
sanctioned by the Board of Supervisors, in firmly in
trenching an obnoxious monopoly in the most
densely populated business and residence sections of
San Francisco. It has also recognized the wants and
the rights of the northeastern quarter, so long neg
lected, which were impressed into the service of the
corporation, so that, under cover of supplying a
proper and imperative, demand, it might impregnably
fortify its position before the new charter becomes
operative.
It is useless to recapitulate the details of the at
tempted grab. They are already well understood.
The vital question is, What does the Board of Super
visors intend to do? How can it meet an actual ne
cessity for the extension and improvement of street
railway facilities, with entire fairness to this aggres
sive monopoly, and yet without throwing away
municipal property and sacrificing the common in
terests its members are sworn to protect?
The Huntington argument, invoked for street rail
ways as well as for State lines and national high
roads, and almost flung at the people, is very short
and pointed â "We intend to help ourselves; how do
you propose to help yourselves?" This mode of set
tling public questions is irritating and almost unen
durable, but in the past it has been effective. It has
been quite humiliating as well as exasperating for
three hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants of a com
mercial metropolis to have to ask themselves how
much of their earnings were to be confiscated through
some of their representatives in the municipal legis
lature and to what extent municipal property was to
be donated to corporations in order that they might
use the resources of a community, gratuitously ac
quired, to extort enormous incomes from the indi
viduals of whom the community is composed.
If the present Board of Supervisors contains a ring
of seven, with absolute power to act, irrespective of
the minority and of the Mayor, and who are the mere
tools of the street railway monopoly, then there is no j
doubt that the seven can outvote the five. But, while
fully comprehending the pessimism of our citizens
predicated of past experience, The Call has not yet
become convinced that, in the year 1899, we" have one
of those rings. It prefer* to believe that the proposals
of the Market Street Railway Company are to be sub
jected to some honest and intelligent test.
On this assumption, then, what ought to be done?
The Call did not support the new charter, but when
that instrument received popular indorsement and leg- :
islative ratification it became the law, to be respected ;
and enforced as long as it constitutionally exists. I
The last expression of the public will, therefore, is
that no franchise or privilege should be granted ;
within the municipal limits except in conformity with
its provisions. If the Board of Supervisors accepts j
the instruction of the ballot-box and of the Legisla- j
ture, the entire subject ought to be postponed till
after January I, 1900.
But suppose it be admitted that the exigency of the :
situation, under the promptings of the North Central
Improvement Association and the Merchants' Asso- |
ciation, will not admit of eight months' delay, and j
that pome immediate action must be taken, what .
should it be? The answer is very plain. If the ob
ject to be attained is to connect the northeastern part
of San Francisco with the Potrero and the interven
ing territory, all that is essential or that could be
honestly required is that the application of the Mar
ket Street Railway Company for a new connecting
franchise on Taylor street, between Geary and Post
streets, be granted, and that, if the law permits, it
be awarded the privilege of using electricity on its
entire line from Brannan street .to Montgomery
street and along that street and through Washington
and Jackson streets to Sansome street, and perhaps
on Sansome street for one block. This would involve
'some material changes in the order for which the
company has petitioned in order to annex the privi
lege of using electricity to "franchises heretofore \
granted." It would eliminate Geary street from Tay
lor street to Grant avenue. That portion of the order
to which we have not specifically alluded, namely, on
Post street, from Taylor to Leavenworth street, along 1
Leavenworth street and across McAllister street to
City Hall avenue, and thence by way of Grove street,
with crossings on Larkin street and Market street, to
Bryant -street, if included in the electrical privilege,
would perfect the system and meet all the require
ments of the property-owners and public-spirited
citizens in the two associations to which we have re
ferred.
The demand for a new franchise from the intersec
tion of Geary street and Grant avenue to Bush street
and down Bush street to Sansome street, and the ap
plication for the privilege of using electricity on
Geary street, from Taylor street to Grant avenue, and
also on Sansome street, except .between. Washington
and Jackson streets, should be flatly and promptly de
nied. The application for this new franchise is the I
completion of the scheme to exclude competition, i
An electrical line on Sansome street, from Jackson ;
! to Market street, would interfere with heavy traffic ,
and would be an excuse or an opportunity for a sub- â 
I sequent attempt to secure electrical privileges on
Market street. The worst' "joker" in the plan is the
Geary street electrical proposition, and it will be ,
readily understood when the first watering of stock
and issue of bonds by the Market street railway com- I
bination is recalled. The company now has a cable !
, line, mainly' on Geary ' street, from Market street to I
the Golden Gate Park, the franchise for which will
expire in 1902. It also holds unused franchises on !
Geary street, from Grant avenue to Taylor street, i
which ought to have been forfeited long ago, under
section 2of the act of March 13, 1897. The new char- i
ter limits street railway franchises to twenty-five 'â¢
years, and compels the payment during the first five
years, now exempted from such taxation, of 3 per
cent, during the next ten years of 4 per cent, and dur
ing the .last ten years of five per cent, of the gross j
receipts. It also provides that at the end of the term
the road track and bed of the street railway, and ail 'its i
stationary fixtures, shall become the property of the i
municipality. It further secures to the Board of Su- i
j pervisors' the power "to regulate the rates of fare," !
and to its Finance Committee unrestricted opportu- 1
nities to expert the railway books. It also contains
numerous other binding securities for the protection
of the city and county, to which we cannot here ad
vert.
A renewal of the present Geary street franchise,
under the new charter, would bring the Market
Street Railway Company down to the actual value of
the property and would afford no opportunity for a !
repetition of its former strategy by watering stock â 
or by floating bonds. But section 2 of the act. of
March 13. 1897, at any time more than one year be
fore the expiration of the street railway franchise, per- j
mits its surrender, if accepted by the Board of Super- !
visors, and then it can be renewed. If the electrical \
privilege now asked on Geary street as an addition to !
the unused franchises be awarded, then that posses- i
sion which is said to be nine points of the law will
have been guaranteed, and the Market Street Railway
Company will have a hold on Geary street. . between !
THE SAIM FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 13, 1899.
Grant avenue and Taylor street, from which it cannot
be dislodged. It then proposes, as we are credibly
informed, to surrender the operated Geary street
franchise and to obtain a renewal, under the existing
law, embracing the present line from Market street
to the Park, and extended thence" to the Cliff House.
If this can be accomplished it has been reasonably
estimated that, by the expenditure of three hundred
thousand dollars or less, it can insure a return in
round numbers of not less than 6 per cent per annum
on two million dollars. The grandeur of this con
ception is staggering to the ordinary citizen, but it is
a familiar phase of the Huntington policy, and, after
all, only part of a stupendous whole.
The laborious newspaper attorney in fact for the
railroad, in its advocacy of this intricate project of
gripping the major part of San Francisco with the
sharp and unrelaxing tentacles of the Market street
monopoly, proudly boasts that so- far the fares have
not been increased. The public has, been chiefly in
terested in possible reductions. If the fraud on the
new charter and the general clean-up now before the
Board of Supervisors is accomplished, the shortest
and cheapest mode of consummation would be a con
veyance of all the surviving rights of the municipality.
THE PRESIDENT AND THE ADMIRAL.
SAN FRANCISCO, through properly accredited
representatives, has cordially invited a visit
from President McKinley and from Admiral
Dewey. There awaits a most cordial welcome for
each, should he come to us. We on this coast have
not seen so many dignitaries of national rank as to
have become blase with respect to them, like the peo
ple of the East. When a distinguished man of the
I highest rank comes to us we make a holiday and give
him a reception that becomes a notable event in our
annals.
From the tone of the dispatches from Washington
it seems very unlikely that we shall have the pleasure
of receiving Dewey. The Admiral will probably go
home by way of Suez, land at New York and make his
way to Washington by the shortest route. That choice
is not a surprising one, for it is certain that if Dewey
came to San Francisco and took the tour across the
continent the receptions given him at every city and
way station along the route would be more fatiguing
than the Philippine campaign. The Admiral, accord
ing to all reports, is not in robust health, and he may
have good reason for shrinking from the tumultuous
greetings he would have to face from San Francisco
: to Washington if he accept our invitation.
There is a much better prospect of a visit from the
President. Indeed, that visit seems well assured.
McKinley has long planned a trip to the Pacific
Coast, and the coming summer promises to afford
him an 'excellent opportunity for making it. He is
now at Hot Springs, Virginia, building up his
; strength, which has been sadly worn by the nervous
'â¢ strain of the harassing duties of his high office, and
' as soon as he is fully restored to health he will prob
j ably start West. It would, in fact, be wise on his
I part to come before the heat of the Eastern summer
1 sets in, for there is no better place at which to seek
refuge from the sweltering East than on this coast.
Californians will need no urging to induce them to
make extensive preparations for the President's visit.
As soon as it is assured that he is coming every com
munity along the line of his route in the State will
be eager to welcome him and do him honor. It is
to be hoped he will not undertake a hurried trip.
The experience of President Harrison's hasty tour
some years ago is sufficient to show that such a
! course is unsatisfactory to all concerned. To enjoy
' his visit and to derive the full benefit of the journey
the President should remain at least a month within
the limits of the commonwealth. He will find abun
dant employment for every day of it, and his welcome
will show no diminution of popular enthusiasm.
There are many reasons why Californians should
be glad to receive McKinley. With his inauguration
there began that revival of prosperity which is now
so abundant throughout the Union. He stands as the
! foremost representative and champion of that states
manship which upbuilds American industries, and
every class of citizens, from capitalists to working
men, will unite to do him honor.
PHILANTHROPY AND SENSE.
ANDREW CARNEGIE has given an explicit j
and emphatic denial to the report that his ac- j
tion in closing out his business interests was I
due to a dislike of trusts. He declares he is neither ,
antagonistic to trusts nor is afraid of them. The ;
Carnegie Steel Company, he asserts, is the greatest
property of the kind in the world' and has a prosper
ous future as well assured as anything can be in i
human affairs. He has retired from business, he says, I
simply because he desires to live a dignified and un- \
selfish life, freed from all struggling after more
dollars.
. He has given no intimation of how he proposes to
enjoy the leisure he has so well earned, nor of what
he will do with his fortune, which has been estimated
at the enormous sum of $100,000,000. When his atten
tion was called to an editorial in a London paper re
ferring to his noted statement of some years ago, "To
die rich is to die disgraced," he is reported to have ;
said: "Tell that editor to watch and see. I hope j
I shall not justify the definition, sometimes deserved, I
of a philanthropist as a man with a great deal of I
money and very Tittle sense.'"
. There was a time, when the word "philanthropist" j
was used to signify one who so loved his fellowman !
that he devoted the best energies of his life to the ser
vice of humanity. John Howard, Samuel Wilber
force, Elizabeth Fry and others like persons of j
little wealth but rich in zeal and animated with a j
genuine sympathy for all who sufferâ -were alone
honored with that title, but now it has come to mean
a rich man of many millions who makes a gift to the
public.
As a rule the greater portion of the wealth distrib
! uted by successful Americans has been well directed.
! Few among them have posed as philanthropists.
Many have expressly disclaimed the title. They have
', given of their fortunes for the foundation of schools,,
! colleges, libraries, art galleries and charitable institu
; tions. In nearly all such instances their liberality has
: been widely beneficial.. It happens, however, that
some ostentatious givers have bestowed their gifts
from considerations of vanity or sentiment, and as
many of these have been harmful rather than helpful
to the communities receiving them, they have given
; rise to the definition to which Carnegie refers.
It is indisputable that a rich man without sense is
i more injurious than a rich man without munificence.
Wealth is rarely ever better employed than when in
vested in great industries that give work and wages
to thousands of people. To withdraw it from that
employment for the purpose of bestowing it upon
promiscuous charities is by no means an act of good
; sense. â  Mr, Carnegie evidently means he is not going
Jto scatter his wealth in that way. He is now a very
; interesting figure to all institutions in America and
! Great Britain that would like endowments, and he
j need not fear but what he will be watched by more
; neoole than the editor whose watchine he has invited.

Lawyers Undertake to Recover the
Amounts Paid for Licenses
Since February on a Con
â¢ tingent.
Some of the heaviest license-payers in
| the city, including merchants, bankers
and theatrical managers, have signed a
petition, at the instance of Knight &
Heggerty and Frank McGowan, lawyers,
demanding the refunding of the amounts
they have paiu into the License Collect
or's office since February, on the ground
that the new charter abolishes' the office
of License Collector and that the charter
became operative immediately upon its
approval by the Legislature.
These business men have signed the pe
tition with the understanding that they
will receive 50 per cent of the amount so
refunded and shall not be put to any ex
pense for the collection, the attorneys de
fraying all costs and taking the other 50
per cent for their trouble. It is asserted
that fully 1500 license-payers have entered
into the agreement with the lawyers.
It is not apparent how the lawyers ex
pect to prove their contention, for the
charter Itself expressly provides that it
shall become operative on January 1, 1900.
The following is taken from an anno
tated volume on the new charter by At
torney E. F. Treadwell:
When the charter takes eft-actâ By the pro
visions of this schedule the charter, except for
certain purposes, goes into effect on the Ist
day of January. IWO. . Section s of article XI
of the constitution provides that if the charter
is "approved by a majority vote of the mem
bers elected to each house, it shall become the
charter of such city," etc. Under the pro
vision there might be some â¢ question as to
wfcether the charter does not take effect as
SGWi as adopted by the legislature; but It is
not believed that this is the effect of the pro
visions of the constitution.
This question was first raised by Tax
Collector Sheehan early in February,
when he applied to the .Supervisors fur
more funds with which to conduct his of
fice, claiming that under the new charter
the duties of License Collector had de
volved upon him, and as that instrument
had gone into effect immediately upon its
approval by the Legislature, it was nec
essary for him to employ additional help
to collect licenses.
The matter was referred to City and
County Attorney Lane, who submitted a
written opinion to the board on Febru
ary 18 adverse to the Tax Collector's
â¢ contention. Attorney Lane quoted at
length from the State constitution in sup
port of his 'finding. He said there was
nothing in the constitution in conflict
with the express provision of the charter
postponing the time of its becoming ope
rative until January 1, 1900. It might go
into effect immediately upon its approval
by the Legislature if the charter itself
did not' fix the date upon which it was
to become operative. In closing Attorney
Lane said: "I therefore advise that the
new charter is not now in operation, *ââ¢
Cept for the purpose of an election to be
held in November next, and, further, that
for general purposes it does not go into
effect until January 1, 1900."
That, apparently, ls about as good law
as any the attorneys who are seeking to
mulct the city out of many thousands of
dollars may have to support their conten
tion, but it is possible they may have a
joker up their sleeve. If they have, they
are careful not to expose it now. Frank
McGowan was not inclined to discuss the
matter yesterday beyond stating that a
test would be made shortly.
But even this test. it appears. is not to
be made directly on the question of li
censes. The plan as at present outlined
is to induce some employe of the city,
who is entitled to more pay under the
charter, to institute mandamus proceed
ings against Auditor Asa R. wells to
compel him to audit his claim at the in
creased rate. Efforts were made to in
duce some captain of police to begin suit
on these lines, but there is an evident
shyness among those interested to do
this but it is hoped that somebody will
be found who will be willing to have the
fight made in his name.
Prominent lawyers take little stock in
the contention, and"even the business men
themselves who ' have gone into the
scheme do not express much hope of get
ting any returns from it. As one of them
â¢said yesterday: "It doesn't cost us any
thing to attempt to get our license money
back and if we receive 50 per cent we
are just that much ahead. The lawyers
take all the risk and they are welcome to
the other half." .

FATAL DELAY
MAY DEFEAT THE
BOND ELECTION
â¦
Surveyor Tilton Said
to Be Disqualified.
â Â« â
TWO SALARIES PROHIBITED
â Â« â
CANNOT RECEIVE PAY AS A
SEWER COMMISSIONER.
.
His Appointment Said to Be Ren
dered Void by "a Provision
of the Consolidation
Act.
â¢
The intent of the resolution recently
I adopted by the Board of Supervisors rel
ative to the preparation of plans for a
i sewer system to be submitted to the peo
! ple at a bond election bids fair to be
frustrated by reason of the alleged In
\ eligibility of one of the three Commission
ers selected to perform the work. By the
terms of the resolution the work was del
egated to a commission composed of
Marsden Manson, C. E. Grunsky and
City and County Surveyor Tilton. Each
jof the Commissioners is to receive the
i sum of $4000.
It is this item of compensation that is
! causing all of the trouble, as it is al
! leged that under the law the Board of
Supervisors has no power to grant addi
. tional compensation to an official who
: receives a salary from the municipal gov
'; ernment. It is also asserted that the
â  same law debars a salaried official from
receiving or accepting any remuneration
from the city other than his salary. If
this construction of the law is correct
Mr. Tilton's membership in the commis
; sion will have to be canceled and the va
, cancy will have to be filled by resolution
;of the Board of Supervisors. The time ,
! required to correct this mistake, if one !
i has been made, will so retard the inaug
uration and completion of the work re
quired of the commission that not suffi- i
, cient time will be left to comply with i
the provisions of the law in the matter
iof calling a bond election. The election
must be held during the present year if |
iat all. Messrs. Manson and Grunsky es
timate that it will require at least four j
months' time to make the necessary sur- j
j veys and prepare the plans for the pro-
I posed sewer system. This being so, the j
; delay of a month in the inauguration of
the work will prove fatal to the plan for
holding a bond election in. December.
Those who contend that City and Coun
ty Surveyor Tilton is not eligible to a
place on the commission at a salary of
$4000 for the term of his services point
â  to the following section of the consolida
tion act in support of their contention:
Article 1, Section 11â No compensation
shall be allowed to Supervisors or School
Directors, ana no fees or compensation to
be raid out of the city and county treas
ury, other than those allowed in this act.
shall be allowed or received by any officer
of said city and county, or of .any district;
nor shall any allowance or provision be
made for them, or any of them, at trie pub
lic, expense, under Â£he name of office rent,
fuel, lights, etc. _â¢-".-;" -j "., -T. ;
â  The foregoing seems to be explicit and
convincing. The only compensation' to .
be paid by the city to the Surveyor is
'. fixed by "the consolidation act as fol
; lows: â¢ '{"Â»'â  * . .--*." â Â..'
To the City and County. Surveyor, $500
per annum, which shall be in lieu of all
fees or other charges for official services,
which would otherwise be a city and
county charge, and he shall charge and col
lect for services rendered individuals such
fees as may be prescribed and allowed by
the Board of Supervisors.

ject of serious consideration by Mayor
Phelan and the members of the Board of

The above-named gentlemen, who qual
ified as talesmen on the jury of Peter Mc-
Glade, late of the Street Department,
who was charged with forging various
warrants upon the City and County
Treasurer, came into court late yesterday
afternoon and filed a verdict finding th*
defendant not guilty of the crime charged
against him. The verdict was as great a
surprise to the accused as it was to the
court-frequenters, but the end is not yet.
McGlade must stand trial upon a score
more of forged warrants before he can
call himself a free man, and the term
necessary to try these cases stretches
itself out along a weary length; so doubt
less the decision of yesterday failed to
materially raise the hopes of the accused.
McGlade was tried upon a specific
charge of having forged a warrant upon
the Street Department for $96 in the
name of a party who "was not only a
minus quantity upon the payroll of the
Street Department but as well on any
branch of the municipal government. Mc-
Glade's counsel contended that inasmuch
as the warrant was illegal upon Its face
it was not the subject of a forgery. After
a lengthy argument Judge Cook over
ruled the objection of the defendant's
counsel to the admission of the docu
ment and the case proceeded. A majority
of the officials connected with the Super
intendent of Streets' office were called to
testify against the accused, and hand
writing experts gave their opinion ...at
the document upon which the charge was
based was forged by the accused. In de
fense of the charge McGlade was placed
upon the stand and his testimony alone
-was presented, after which the case was
argued. â¢ Shortly before noon the jury was
charged and retired to deliberate upon a
verdict. The hours passed and no signal
from the jury called the Deputy Sheriff
to the door. Just as the time for an ad
journment came the bell signaled that a
verdict had been reached. Judge Cook
was summoned, the jury, was brought into
court and announced that the defendant
was not guilty. Congratulations were
then in order, but McGlade was not ex
tremely cheerful, as other charges yet re
main to be heard. Judge Cook dis
missed the jury that freed the accused,
and put the cases still standing against
the accused over for further consid
eration. The courtroom was then cleared,
McGlade held a whispered conversation
with his counsel and the day's session
was at an end. â¢ â â :-' \- ".â "â¢â ,

Judge Mogan found yesterday that Mrs.

take," which is the way the gallant ex
ponent of the law put the <as of embez
zlement and larceny preferred against the
lady by her ex-landlord, B. J. Levy.
Mrs. Marceau had been occupying the
furnished Levy flat at 2112 Devisadero
street, and while moving the Japanese
servants had unwittingly packed the land-
lord's belongings with those of their mis- i
tress. When Levy discovered his loss he
at once secured a search warrant, and ac- \
companied by an officer proceeded to the
present Marceau residence at 834 Haight
street. Here he discovered the greater
part of the missing articles, which Mrs.
Marceau gladly and immediately restored
to him.
Yesterday morning in Judge Mogan's
court Levy explained in detail the exact
number of sheets, pillow-cases, table
cloths and napkins that were still coming
to him. and also made reference to a set
of carvers, likewise a rose Jar, which was
masquerading in the inventory as bric-a

In the very latest fashion and leaned back
in the witness chair with the easy grace
of a social queen in her boudoir. Her tone
was a confidential, conversational one, and
she tactfully overruled all Interruptions
on the part of the Judge or prosecuting
attorneys with a charming "Pardon me,
but pray allow me to proceed."
"You see, it was this way, Judge," she
said. "Mr. Gregory rented Mr. Levy's
house for me. Mr. Gregory is sometimes
known as my brother (but he is not). My
mother had a protege (a sweet, pretty
girl). I loved her as my sister. Mr.
Gregory married bar, and that Is why. he
Is sometimes known as my brother. (His;
wife is a most harming woman, too).
"Well, Mr. Gregory took the Levy flat \
and asked me to come and live with them ;
as a boarder. It would be better for me, he
said. 1 had just got my divorce. That is I
a month ago. 1 was separated from my I
former husband. Mr. Fennell, In Judge '
Hunt's court (everything was settled
most satisfactorily and peaceably). Well,
I went to live with Mr. Gregory. Then he I
was suddenly called to Oregon on most
complicated business and 1 found myself
with his flat on my hands. 'Don't worry.'
; said Mr. Gregory to me, 'I'll attend to all
the billsâ and he did (I did not even have !
to pay the ice man).
"Levy made my life unbearable." Mrs.
Marceau went on, smiling sweetly upon
the Judge. "He was always coming up
to see I did not spoil the house. He came
so regularly i really thought he. was a
boarder. lie brought his wife and baby j
once also with him. I did not see them.
Mv friends told me (I believe my friends).
"When 1 decided to move I arranged to
' pack mv own personal belongings my
j gowns, etc. (I have no maid). I hired a
Japanese servant to help my Chinaman
and Japanese boy to pack the household
goods. The hoy 1 hired at an employ- :

strong and industrious, but very ignor- i
ant.) 'Pack only my things.' 1 told him. j

four months In Japan and can say a few j

"When Levy came with his search war- j

my keys and said, 'Here, .go through |
everything. Anything that belongs to j
you J. shall be most glad to let you nave. ;
Some of the things had gone to the wash,

advised me to go to the Chinese laundry,
but 1 do as well at the French laundryâ l

I go over the clothes and take what be-
longs to him. I sent him a message to
that effect by my attorney, W. A. Rich
ardson. (Mr. Richardson dined with me
on Friday night.)"
When Mrs. Marceau had finished her
narrative Judge Mogan decided that there
was no evidence of criminal Intent, a.nd

AN ENERGETIC PASTOR
Rev. W. B. Anderson Hopes to Re-
duce His Church's Debt.
Rev. W. B. Anderson, pastor of Bethel
A. M. E. Church, Powell street, near
Jackson, has the membership of his
church well organized. They have been
on a financial campaign for several weeks
trying by church entertainments and so
licitations to get $1200 together by to-mor
row, the 14th. Their church property has
a mortgage of $6500 upon it, but this the
pastor, who enjoys the highest esteem of
his Bock, together with them, has worked
nobly during the last three years to free
the church from debt. It Was thought at
one time before Rev. Mr. Anderson took
charge that the church would be lost, but
since he has had charge and proved to be
the right sort of leader all fear of such
j a catastrophe is banished. The church !
i was almost $9000 ln debt three years ago; ;
j now its Indebtedness is $6500.
The rally that takes place to-morrow i
â  promises to surpass any previous gather
j ing. The congregation is deserving of
! public help and the people will doubtless
; turn out and assist materially In relieving
this burdened church.
Following is the programme: 6 a. m
prayer meeting, led by the pastor; 11 a.
m., sermon by Rev. John Pointer, P. E ;
1:30 p. m., rally by the Sunday-school, j
H. Fisher, superintendent; 3 p. m., ad
dresses by Rev. E. T. Cottman of Oak
; land and Rev. T. Brown of Zion's Church;
7:4.", p. m.. Rev. J. li. Kelly of the Third
Baptist Church and Rev. T. Brown of
Zlon's Church will have charge; Rev
Kelly will -reach the sermon and Rev!
Mr. Brown will make the appeal for the
collection. At this service all of the dif
ferent clubs will make their report, and it '
i is quite assured that the $1200 asked for
| will ice realized.
Her Application Denied.
Judge Hunt has dismissed the second
petition of Mrs. Clara Augusta Gordon
Wilson for partial distribution to her and
her four children of a portion of the estate
of the late John C. Wilson, the capitalist,
who died in 1897. Wilson left behind him
a will In which he bequeathed the bulk of
an estate valued at $200,000 to his widow,
Agnes Wilson, and the residue to two
sons. John C. and Hugh Wilson.
Eighteen months* afterward Mrs. Clara
Augusta Gordon Wilson, claiming to be a
widow, of the deceased, petitioned the
court for a partial distribution of the
estate and asked that decedent's will be
revoked and set aside. Judge Hunt yes
terday decided that the application for a
partial distribution of the estate â  was
nothing but an application to revoke the
will, which was barred by the statute of
limitations. .Hence he dismissed the ap
plication, and the estate will be distrib
uted according to the will heretofore filed.

IN SIDEWALK ELEVATORS
JA.MES ALLIATO. a workman in
the employment of P. H. Jackson
& Co. at 228 First street, met with
a terrible death yesterday morn
ing in the sidewalk elevator on the
premises of the Remington Arms
Company at 425 Market street. He had
been sent by his employers to make
certain repairs and Improvements to
the elevator of the Remington Arms
Company building, and having occa
sion to open the Iron doors in the side
walk he started on the elevator, in
tending to unlock the doors in his up
ward passage and thus emerge from
the basement. But the elevator went
too fast for him, or he lost his pres
ence <*f mind, and before he had a
chance to open the doors he was
crushed against a girder in the side
walk.
The victim was still breathing and
moaning when placed in the ambu
lance, but he died before the vehicle
reached the City Receiving Hospital.
The body was taken to the Morgue
and an inquest will be held.
Alllato was unmarried, a native of
Switzerland, 35 years old.

vator yesterday afternoon, both bones of his left leg being fractured. The
boy was sent to the basement to wait till the scavengers had taken away
the refuse. After they left he went Into the elevator, locked the door and
took hold*Of the? rope to start It. He pulled on the rope too hard and the
elevator gave a sudden jerk that caused the boy^S head to strike against
the top and he fell. His left leg was jammed between the wall and the bot
tom of the elevator.
Cohen's cries for help were heard by several of the employes in the store *
and they ran to his assistance. As the door was locked It took some time *
and ingenuity to get the boy out of his painful predicament, and as soon as *
lie was released he fainted. He was taken to the Receiving Hospital, where .
it was found that he had sustained a compound fracture of both-t>ones of the â 
left leg. He lives at 1617 Church street. *
About the same time John McGrath, a boy employed in the delivery de- *
partment In Hale Bros." store on Market street and who lives at 1620 Church *
â¢street, was taken to the hospital with lacerated wounds of the forehead *
and eyebrows. He went to the New York Kitchen, 915 Market street, to col- *
lect a bill, and thought he would go to the basement in the chute used for
lowering boxes. When he got Inside the wind blew the door on him and he
was struck on the head and knocked senseless. *

At the special session of the Board of
Regents yesterday afternoon the election
of a new president of the State Uni
versity was deferred until the regular
meeting in June. The regents attending
the meeting yesterday were: T. G. Phelps
(presiding), James A. Waymire, Dr.
George C. Pardee, A. B. Spreckels, Alden
Anderson. Thomas J. Kirk, Charles \V.
Slack, Arthur Rodgers, Dr. Chester Row
ell, General Houghton. John E. Budd,
E. A. Denlcke. A. S. Hallldie, H. 6. Foote,
William T. Wallace. Albert Miller and
President Kellogg.
According to the estimates of tne
finance committee the additional sum of
$47,000 is needed to maintain the Institu
tion for the next year. A proposition to
impose a tax on the Students to raise the
amount required provoked a vigorous re
sistance. â¢
Judge Wallace contended that it would
be contrary to law to Impose the tax. It
would be a shook to the public sentiment
of the State if the regents should do this
thing. He spoke logically and earnestly
against the proposed measure of taxa
tion.
Dr. Rowell of Fresno registered a pro
test against the proposed tax. He be
lieved the exigencies of the case could be
met by other plans. He was in favor of
revising the budget and reducing ex
penses.
The proposition to tax the students was
defeated. The regents who voted to im
pose the tax were: Denicke, Kellogg,
Hallldie, Houghton, Miller and Phelps.
In further discussion respecting means
JAMES ALLIATO.
for adjusting the financial difficulties the
statement was made by Regent Budd
that salaries had been increased $100,000 '
in the past three years.
Judge . Waymire believed that th* re- '
gents could safely count on receiving
next year more money from the 2 cent
tax than was secured this year
Mr. Hallldie gave notice that he would
not vote to elect a new president until
the financial affairs of the institution
were settled.
Judge Slack believed in having a frank
talk with the heads of departments at
Berkeley. He called to mind that financial ;
distress in the past had been tided over
without recourse to a tax on students
The suggestion was made that $7700 ex
pended on a fad. known as pedagogy or
teaching teachers how to teach, might be
saved. No one suggested bringing a suit
to recover $2400 paid for lobbying at Sac
ramento two years ago.
Regents Rowell. Slack and Denicke
were appointed to assist the finance com
mittee In devising a plan to overcome the
financial obstacles now confronting the !
university. The committee, was In
structed to submit a report at the June" :
meeting.
When Regent Rodgers observed tnat
his associates on the board, and particu
larly Hallldie and Miller, were in no
frame of mind promising unanimity in
the selection of a president, he moved
that the subject be postponed until the
June meeting. y>, . â¢
Mr. Hallldie handed to the secretary
the list of names submitted or recom
mended. He said the men whose names
were on the list were not candidates for
the presidency. They were not seeking
the office, but had been recommended.
At the suggestion of one of the regents,
the secretary began to read the names.
He got no further along than the first
nameâ that of J. E. Stubbs, president of
the Nevada State Universityâ before pro
tests were entered against giving the â 
names to the public.
Regents Wallace and Foote wanted to
know what good could be served by with
holding the names from the public.
Mr. Rodgers gave an example of the
evil effects of publicity. He said, for in
stance, if D. C. Oilman's name should be !
on the list and the list made public it
might place Mr. Oilman in a delicate posi- I
tion before his trustees. The same might
be said of President Adams of the Wis
consin University. The convincing and
unanswerable arguments of Regent Rod- :
gers had so much weight that the board
decided to give the list of names to the j
regents but not to the press.
The list in question appears at the head :
of this report of the special meeting, but
It should be considered that it is there for '
! the convenience of regents and not for i
public enlightenment.

cumbrances and the new corporation starts with ample working capital.
The product is a staple necessity. The industry is an Important and growing
one and is not affected by the tariff or financial disturbances.
The management, as can readily be seen, is strong, experienced, capable
and Conservative.
A thorough examination of these properties has been made by Mr. Robert
Shaw of Chicago, who has been for many years in the Biscuit Business, who
certifies that they are valuable and well adapted to the business. An expert
accountant engaged by the organizers of the new corporation certifies, after a
thorough examination of the accounts for a period of years, that the earnings of
the various companies operated separately have made for a number of years
past, In spite of the severe competition which has existed among them, a net
average annual profit of $205,000 per annum and that a conservative estimate of
the earnings of the company after consolidation would be in excess of $400,000
without raising the price of standard goods to the Consumer.
The PREFERRED STOCK of $100 per share is cumulative, and dividends of
7 per cent are payable semi-annually. It has full voting power and together with
the common stock is registered and is issued full paid non-assessable, carrying

POLICE WANT A PATROL BOAT.
Members of the Board of Health ap
peared before the Health and Police Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors yes
terday and presented reasons why the
State quarantine boat should not be taken
away from the Health Department and
turned over to the Police Department for
use in patrolling the water front. Dr.
Williamson and others stated that the
State laws require that the State Quaran
tine Officer shall board and inspect all
Incoming vessels and that It would be im
possible to perform, this duty as required
by statute should the quarantine boat be
turned* over to the Police Department.
He stated that the inefficiency of the
Federal quarantine service made it im
perative that the present system of quar
; antine be continued in order to protect
' the city against the introduction and
spread of contagious diseases.
Chief Lees, on behalf of the Police De
partment, said that he was not particular
whether he was given the use of the pres
â  ent quarantine boat or some other equally
serviceable vessel, but that the necessi
ties of his department demanded a boat,
and he looked to the Board of Supervisors
to provide him with one. The matter was
taken under advisement by the com- j
mittee. I
The committee considered Informally
the proposition of the San Francisco Ath- j
letic Club to hold a boxing contest In the I
near future. The club has not applied
for and has not been granted a permit to
hold the fight which is now being adver
j tised on all of the downtown street cor
ners nor has It paid the necessary license
fee. ' Chief Lees assured the members of
the committee that unless the club com
plied with all of the requirements of the
law he would not permit the exhibition
1 to be held.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 12â The bulls had the
better of the speculative contest to-day, but
the edge was taken off the rise in the last
few minutes of trading by a vigorous bear
raid. The continued purchases for London ac

money or sterling exchange markets were

misleading, were thought to forecast a favor

few known Industrial consolidations financed.
At times the stock market was very erratic.
There was first a recession from the opening
high level, and then a gradual recovery until
near the close. Sugar moved over a radius
of nearly ten points and closed with a rise
of six; Brooklyn Transit lost nearly a point
net. but closed nearly two points above the
figures reached in the raid. American Tobacco
lost nearly three points after a dip of twice
as much. Metropolitan dropped to 218%, jumped
over six "points and left off with a gain of
over two points. The Iron and steel shares
were rather weak, as were the coalers, but
the Pacifies and grangers were strong with
fractional advances appearing pretty generally

Immense blocks of high grade mortgages were

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, May 12.â Bradstreet's financial
review to-morrow will say:
At the beginning of the week the market ex
perience.] a general decline, attended by con
siderable liquidation of long stock. On Wednes
day it rallied sharply on support by large in
terests and exceptionally large purchases for
London. This fact was. however, apparently
due to the existence- of a large interest in
Americans in the foreign market, while cov
ering by the local professional bears also con
tributed toward the recovery of prices. The
European purchasing continued on Thursday,
and there was also further evidence of support
from the so-called big people, but the market
developed hesitation and declining tendencies,
Its weakness centering in the stocks which
would be affected should the Ford franchise
tax law become cine of the laws of New York.
On Friday the action of speculation was Ir
regular. An early decline was checked by the
strength of Sugar and other manipulated
stocks, and the expectation of a good bank
statement also had an effect.
It is noticed that the drop In prices this week
was in the main the result of a purely specu
lative case, to wit, the Overbought condition
of the market. Stocks have accumulated ln
the hands of people who bought on margin in
expectation of continued rise The buying
power has, however, become measurably ex
hausted, while disappointment at the action of
the market produced as it would naturally a
disposition to realize. The decline of last week.
though not severe, aggravated this tendency,
while in many cases margins were weakened to
an extent which furnished occasion for en
forced liquidation. One of the most prominent
manipulative ooerators of the street, whose
name was by common report coupled with a
supposed bear syndicate, denies the impeach
ment. But other professional speculators cer
tainly took an aggressive stand on the bear
side and contributed by the selling pressure
they produced to bring about the outpouring of
long stocks which characterized the mark-is
on Monday and Tuesday. Other conditions.
however, played their separate parts in the
movement. The expectation of an unfavorable
Government crop report was considered, though
the street apparently disregarded on Wednes
day, and it was not until Thursday that the
Grager stocks were sold on the theory that the
report shows a reduction of the whole output
calculated' to affect railroad traffic and earn
ings. The market has not suffered from any
fears of tight money. On the contrary, sup
plies of funds seem to lie Increasing and the
rates were appreciably easier. The collection
from the Government of 815.000,000 of the Span
ish indemnity by the Institution which acted
In the matter of remitting the 820,000,000 was a
factor, and the movement of money now seems
to be toward the metropolis. The bond mar
ket has been unaffected by the events affect
ing speculative values, and the demand for in
vestments ls as large and almost as eager as
at any previous time. On the other hand the
financial public has finally begun to appreciate
the effects of the continued creation of new In
dustrials securities, and a conservative senti
ment has asserted Itself In this connection. It
â was generally remarked that thÂ«Â» alleged propo
sition to erect a billion-dollar steel trust by a
combination of the industrials also formed In
that trade seemed to touch the limits of the in
dustrial movement, and some relief was felt
when it was known that the foundation for
this was merely the nlan to consolidate the
Carnegie properties and to purchase the inter
ests of their founder In them. The appetite of
the public for industrials has not. however, de
parted, as shown by the J412.000.000 subscription
to the $75,000,000 Stock of the amalgamated cop
per company, although that enterprise has
been severely criticized in some quarters, and it
is noted that the stock rose quickly from a pre
mium of about five to one of a fraction above
par.
BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITION?.
NEW YORK. May 12.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Reports as to trade conditions
are generally of a favorable tenor, notable
among these being advanced quotations for
many grades of iron and steel, increased ac
tivity in building lines reflected In heavy sales
of lumber at prices tending upward, a firmer
tone In the cotton goods market, sympathized
in by the raw product, bank clearings sur
passing all records for this week of the year,
railroad earnings maintaining recent gains and
business failures, as for some time past, down
to the minimum. Offsetting these in some
measure might be cited the seasonable quiet
ing down of wholesale distributing demand,
particularly for dry goods and clothing, but
most notable of all, the further weakening of
cereal values, reflecting the indifference of for
eign buyers, in spite of the definitely con
ceded fact that our winter wheat acreage has
been considerably curtailed, lower quotations
of hog products and some shading of prices In
sugar, copper and tin. If conditions of de
mand, supply, invisible wheat reserved and
foreign crop advices did not favor lower prices
the Government report might have been re
garded as a bullish publication. The weak
ness of the market, under the circumstances
may, therefore, be regarded as reflecting the
feeling among foreign consumers that good
crops abroad and the refilling of deplete, 1 re
serves from last year's yield will furnish
wheat In plenty.
The demand ln iron and steel does not weak

imum, is still inadequate, and the stocks of
plglron show a further decrease.' Reports that
possible foreign business in this line has been
rejected come from producing centers, but the
efforts of foreigners to obtain supplies here is,
nevertheless, testimony to their own productive
abilities being heavily taxed. It seems evi
dent that the first real inspiration In the wool
industry must come from abroad. Heavy buy
ing of Australian grades for re-export has
been again the feature, but coupled with this
are reported liberal sales at leading markets
of domestic wool to go abroad.
In the building trades, activity is very gen- j

DUN'S WEEKLY REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, May 12.â G. Dun & Co. in
j their weekly review of trade will say:
To speak truly of business this week one
; must free the mind of stocks, for a severe
decline in manufacturing stocks has created
j an impression that It has some relation to I
productive industry, but it has none. There !
was no change in the money market worth !
I mentioning and the volume of business shown I
by payments through the principal clearing-
.uses was 71.5 per cent larger than, in 1892, '
the year > -i greatest prosperity hitherto, which l
ls more than double the gain anybody con
sidered possible a year ago.
Never before reaching a quarter of a mil
lion tons per week, the Iron Manufacturer
reports May 1, an output of 250,093 tons weekly,
which, with 54,455 decrease In warrant and
furnace stocks, indicates a consumption of
37,322 tons daily, against 37.035 In March, 34,814 1
in February and 36,834 In January. The aver- 1
age for four months Is 38,027 tons dally, against !
32,209 last year. An increase of 16 per cent I
in the- year would P.- less interesting if con
sumption a year ago were not far beyond any
thing previously realized. Yet proposed com- I
binations hinder large orders In bars and
sheets, while the structural business is as ;
heavy as ever in small lots, with bid contracts
about to come at Chicago for the drainage
canal and the plate business too big for all I
the works to handle, invites no consolidation,
the Chicago and Philadelphia works being be
hind in deliveries and Pittsburg works troubled !
by demands for 4000 tons of vessel plates and !
4000 tons more close ahead for the Government ,
docks at Algiers.
Only pig Iron advanced, Bessemer 50c and |
grey forge 25c at Pittsburg and local pig 50c
lat Chicago. In minor metals tin declined at
London to 25.23 c and copper is weak at 19c
lor spot and 19% C for futures.
Hides at Chicago rose about 10 per cent, with I
actual receipts of cattle in four months of j
100,000 head loss than last year, and over 200. 1
smaller than in 1533-94, notwithstanding the
gain In population.
Nobody who has studied statistics can tell
why purchases or a million pounds Australian
wool for export this week, following others in !
previous weeks, should advance prices of wool, ;
; nor were purchases of five million pounds of j
i territory wool by a speculator readily explain- |
able. But it is just the time for growers to
ask all they can hope to get. and just when j
the largest manufacturers were ready to buy ;
1 only the smaller are buying. Prices Â»ââ¢ said I
' to have been generally advanced, with higher !
demands from the interior holders. But it re- !
mains a question whether sales of 10,499,000
pounds for the week against 5,269.550 Increase
over 1592 and only a little more in 1597 will
prove profitable. The market for woolen goods, ;
tn waiting for evidences of demand which do I
not yet appear, and the delay in getting the
pew combination into working order causes
some hesitation.
If Government estimates were considered re- ,
liable one based on entirely unknown acreage
of wheat and cotton would be everywhere re
sented. Thus, with official returns pointing :
to a great decrease in winter wheat produc- j
! tion, the price dropped 1 cent and cotton de- j
1 clined for options, though retaining the ad- ]
vance of a sixteenth for spot which was es-
I tabllshed before the Government report ap
j peared Nobody can base a sensible estimate â 
I on a statement of condition which takes no
I account of the acreage of winter wheat killed
i and abandoned. The best that can be said Is
i that worse returns were expected in both ,
' markets, so that the Government report had
j practically no Influence.
Failures for the week have been lfa in the
United States against 246 last year, and 20 in
j Canada against 21 last year.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
' CHICAGO, May 12.â Unexpectedly firm cables,
foreign covering nnd light domestic receipts
gave wheat a steady start. There was a mo
, mentary weak spell, caused by profit taking,
but after this the market quickly recovered
and ruled strong the remainder of the ses
sion The reported presence of the Hessian
fly and chinch bugs throughout the Middle
West and Southwest encouraged outside buy-
I ing and forced local shorts to cover. Reports
of relief in the congestion at Buffalo and pre
â  dictions of frosts .in the Northwest, where seed
ing has been seriously delayed, helped the ad
vance. July opened unchanged to %c higher at
70Â®70%C advanced to 70% c, declined to 69% c,
rose to 70%Â©70% C and closed with sellers at
70%@70%c.
There was a sharp advance in corn, owing
to small offerings, light receipts, excellent cash
demand and influential country buying. July
closed %c higher.
Oats followed corn. The cash demand was
good, July advanced %c.
The strength in coarse grains and light re
ceipts of bogs steadied prices of provisions.
The effect was only trifling, as there was suffi
cient liquidation to supply the demand from
shorts and packers. Pork and lard advanced
2%c each and ribs sc.

CALIFORNIA DRIED FRUITS.
NEW YORK, May 12.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The spot supply of California
dried fruits is reported to be smaller than It
has been for several years at this season, and j
it is in few hands. For some time past New j
York has been the chief source of supply for
i dried fruits for markets east of the Rocky
! Mountains, and many orders lor prunes, apri-
I cots and peaches have been placed here within
the past month or six weeks by large buyers
In Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburg and Philadel
phia Of late, however, inquiries from these
markets have been comparatively few and at
the. present time the demand for goods from
interior points is light.
Holders here show no disposition to urge
sales. The local demand since the beginning
of the month has been small. Jobbers appear
to be well If not liberally supplied, and as the
consuming demand has been moderate they
have not come Into the market except when
absolutely necessary to fill up breaks in stocks.

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been six arrivals of coal from Wash
ington with 16,230 tons; seven from British Co
lumbia, 18,210 tons; three from Oregon, 1590
tons; one from Australia, 2756 tons; total, 38,
--786 tons. This amount fully makes up the de
ficiency of last week and serves to make tne
market easy. The spring weather we are now
enjoying diminishes the consumption very ma
terially for domestic uses, still the demand for
steam does not relax, but finds ready sale nt
full prices. We have had only four deliveries
of foreign coal In six weeks, which cleat.,
shows we are almost totally dependent on our
coast collieries for our fuel supplies. If the
craze for establishing "trusts' existed here, that
now prevails East, there is a profitable open
ing here among our colliery proprietors, who
number so few; and their opportunities have
been most favorable, with the Navy Depart
ment â  lately such liberal purchasers, being
forced to pay asking prices, time being a most
important factor In their deliveries. Freights
from England and Australia are very firm: the
anticipated reduction has not materialized; In
fact. It now looks as If present prices are
nearly bedrock for the year: they unquestion
ably are If the outward freights on grain do not
move upward."

Lester Reiff Should Retire From the
Saddle â His Ride on Mary
Black a Ridiculous One. <
Caldwell Stale Again.'
Five out of Fix favorites were led to
the slaughter at Oakland track yesterday
and the books reaped a golden harvest.
It was a genuine, unadulterated "eagle
Mrd" affair for the layers of prices. Kitty
Keily, Valencienne, Ach, Pelxotto and
Mary Black, all heavily backed, were
buried side by side in one grave. It was
Indeed "black Friday" for the speculative
ulnmort
1 ceruit. lit.
The crowd hoped to retrieve its
losses on the six furlong handicap, which
ended the day's sport, but Starter C.'alu
well, with a solar plexus punch, knocked
this vain conceit "galley west." Mary
Black, carrying top weight and ridden by
Lester Beiff, was plunged on at scanty
odds. Th- start wa~ attended by all the
pyrotechnic effects known to modern
horseraclng. with Corrigan's Alaria sent
away four lengths In the lead. ~ tsuma
and Highland Ball 1. ft at the post. Even
with this strong pull in the conditions
Corrigan could not win. Alaria, after
leading to within a few yards of the wire,
was collared and beaten out a head by
game little Tony Llcalzi, a 12 to 1 shot,
piloted by Jack Ward. Lester R< iff, on
the favorite, managed to finish third,
Bambouiia. a growthy king Puryear
D colt, picked up IIS pounds and captured
the opening five furlong dnsh for two
vear-okis like a real good one. Breaking
away third from the barrier he made all
tho pace and won easily from Bathos in
1:02 tlat. Kitty Kelly, the favorite, was
away poorly, but at that showed no
f-peed. The books laid S to 1 against the
winner
Tommy Glover landed the 10 to 1 shot,
Madrone. winner of the second vent, a
Fix furlong sprint. Valencienne ruled fa
vorite, but was unable to head Jerllderio
and ran unplaced. in a hard drive Ma
drone downed Judge Si >uffer a head
through Glover's superior riding. Show
honors fell to Sylvan Lass.
The Corrigan contingent unloaded on
Ach to win the print thai followed, back
ing the erratic performer from 5 to 2 down
to 3 to 3. Away last, he made a good run,
getting to the wire just in time to finish
outside the money*. Macklin had the 8 to

SERIOUS EIRE IN POTRERO.
An Early Morning Conflagration
Brings About the Loss of Two
Dwelling Houses.
An alarm was turned in at 1:15 o'clock
this morning from box 514 for a confla
gration on Michigan street, between
Twenty-first and Twenty-second streets,
Potrero. Two dwelling houses were de
stroyed and a second badly scorched. One
of them was owned by Mrs. Anne Judge
at 249% Michigan street. The house ad
joining her dwelling was unoccupied and
the owner is unknown.
The fire is said to have originated lit
the kitchen of Mrs. Judge's home. A pe
destrian homewardhound saw the smoke
emanating from the kitchen, and believ
ing it was a fire rushed to the branch
Potrero police station and the officer on
duty turned in the alarm. The fire was
speedily got under control by the de
partment. Mrs. Judge and her family
were in bed at the time, but managed to
get out without danger to their lives.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL,. SATURDAY, MAY 13, 1899.
GIGANTIC FRANCHISE STEAL
IS BEFORE THE SUPERVISORS
With Three Hundred Thousand Dollars
Huntington Seeks to Obtain a Six Per
Cent Interest on Two Millions.
.â â â -.' â  -
THE directing spirits of the Market Street Railroad Company have undertaken one of the
most gigantic schemes ever conceived in the interests : of C. P. Huntington and his asso
ciates. An effort is now quietly being made to monopolize street railroad privileges on one
of the great thoroughfares of the city, and to tap without competition for fifty years one of
the most populous districts of San Francisco. If the scheme succeeds the Market Street Rail
road Company will be able to water stock and issue bonds on a fictitious valuation of its property
and secure an enormous interest from, a comparatively small investment. If the plot meets the
sanction of the Board of Supervisors the Market Street Railroad Company will have won another
vicious victory and the charter government will be cheated out of the operation of one of its wisest
reforms.
Like all schemes of the railroad people, this new one is innocent enough on its face.
Among the many franchise privileges asked by the Market street company from the Board of
Supervisors ie one demanding the right to use electricity in the operation of a road, under an un
used franchise, on Geary street, from Grant avenue to Taylor street. In asking for this privi
lege the Market Street Railroad Company pleads that it is necessary in connection with the plan
to give more adequate street railway facilities to the northeastern part of the city, and to connect
that district with the Potrero. It is, therefore, from the point of view of the Market Street Rail
road Company, a matter of public interest to obtain the asked for privilege on Gear}' street.
The demand is nothing of the sort from a point of view which involves the public welfare.
In the first place, Geary street, between Grant avenue and Taylor street, is not necessary to con
nect the northwestern part of the city with the Potrero. There is a better and much more direct
route. In the second place, the unused franchise upon which the privilege of using electricity is
asked should now, under the law, be forfeited.
Under the plea of giving a public benefit the Market street company is planning to se
cure a tremendous monopoly. . If it can secure exclusive privileges on Geary street it will neces
sarily kill all competition and destroy the rest of the thoroughfare to all others for railroad pur
poses. But this is only the beginning of the great scheme.
The Geary street franchise, which the Market street company owns, will expire in 1902.
Under the charter, street railroad franchises may be granted for no longer period than twenty-five
years, and large contributions, based upon gross receipts, must be made to the city. The Market
Street Railroad Company wants to cheat the charter in reference to these restrictions, and will ask
the assistance of the Supervisors in doing so. Under the existing law a railroad franchise may be
surrendered at any time more than one year from its expiration.
The schemers of the Market Street Railroad Company intend, therefore, to surrender their
Gearv street franchise to the city and then secure a renewal. With this sharp play the Market
Street Railroad Company hopes to gain for its Geary street railway monopoly a new lease of life
in no way restricted by the operation of the charter. The treasury of the city will lose a great
revenue, legitimately its own, and the Market street company will be free- to water its stock at will
and issue bonds.
More than this, the Market Street Railroad Company will ask an extension of the Geary
street franchise to the ocean beach, making a continuous road from Kearny street out Geary and
Point Lobos avenue to the ocean. It is estimated that the construction of the road, if the franchise
be granted, will take no more than $300,000. The Market Street Railroad Company will then be
free to reap the enormous profit of its great steal. It will be exempt from the charter provisions,
which restrict the life of a franchise to twenty-five years. It will not have to pay the contributions
to the city as provided by the charter. These are 3 per cent of the gross receipts for the first five
years, 4 per cent of the gross receipts for the next ten years, and 5 per cent of the gross receipts
for the last ten years, with the forfeiture of the roadbed, track and stationary fixtures to the city.
It will readily be seen what tremendous profit will flow 7 to the Market street company if it
cheats the charter by this plot. Nor will this be all. The extension to the ocean beach, as already
indicated, will be made at a cost not exceeding $300,000. The Market street company will then
be able to water its stock at will, issue bonds, and with an expenditure of $300,000 receive in re
turn an interest of 6 per cent on $2,000,000. When the Market Street Railroad Company plans
a steal it schemes a big one. It remains with the Supervisors to determine with what success the
plot shall be rewarded.

Tugs Racing to Secure
the Tow Here.
4,
The disabled steamer Elihu Thomson
anchored two miles off Lighthouse Point,
Santa Cruz, yesterday afternoon and will
probably be towed in through the Golden
Gate this morning. She was spoken by
the steamer Santa Rosa yesterday at 1:30
a. m. and Captain Alexander offered to
tow her Into port, but Captain Whitney
of tho Elihu Thomson refused, saying he
could make Santa Cruz or Monterey un
der sail. v '* .-:
As soon as the news- brought by the
Santa Rosa was made known the tug
Fearless -was at once sent out and an
hour later she was followed by the Res
cue. The two tugs when last seen -were
going full speed and using every ounce
of. steam, so it should be an interesting
race down the coast between them. The
Fearless ls a new vessel and -has never
been fully tried, but she can be depended
upon to give a good account of herself.
Tne Rescue Is a very fast tug, and If the
Fearless beats her down Captain Harry
Marshall will know he has been in a race.
The Elihu Thomson was .on her way
here from Honolulu with a cargo of su
gar. When several days -out- the shaft
broke and her propeller dropped to the
bottom of the ocean. . On April 30 the
transport Senator came along and sup
plied the disabled vessel with provisions,
besides taking off twelve firemen and oil
ers and one passenger. These were after
ward transferred to the steamer Austra
lia and brought to San Francisco. Later
the Thomson was spoken by the City of
Peking, and Captain Smith offered to tow
her into port, but Captain Whitney re
fused, saying he was making about .three'
knots an hour, under sail . and that he
would reach San Franclco all right.
As soon as the news reached here the
tug Relief was sent out to look for the
disabled steamer. She was followed by
the Rescue and later the underwriters
chartered the steamer Rival and sent her
out. The Rescue and Rival returned on
account of the fog and heavy weather,
but the Relief kept on and is out yet.
The underwriters then sent the Rival out
again and . Captain Perriman went along
to direct the course of the vessel and
to assist Captain Johnson. The Rival tis
still out and neither she nor the Relief
will return until their coal supply gives
In the meantime Captain Whitney kept
the Elihu Thomson dodging along under
canvas and has finally landed^ her at
Santa Cruz. There : is nearly $100,000 in
surance on the vessel and cargo, so by
refusing the offer of assistance made him
Captain Whitney has saved the under
writers a small fortune in salvage.
A dispatch from" Santa Cruz last night
stated that the Thomson would start for
this city at once in tow of a tug and would
arrive to-day. , â¢ â 
The Pacific -Mail Company steamers
San Juan and Acapuleo are a day be
hind time. The San Juan left Mazatlan
on' May 5 and the Acapuleo sailed from
China's Powerful Sword.
There Is . an ancient and dreadful eword ln
China. It gives to the man who happens to
hold It the power to cut off the head of any
one he wishes without danger of punishment
AH people flee from this sword as fearfully as
stomach Ills flee before the approach of Hos
tetter's Stomach Bitters. This famous remedy
cures all forms of stomach troubles/beginning
with constipation and ending with liver or
kidney disease. It will be found ln all drug
stores and It always cures.
Acapuleo on May 4. Both vessels were
expected here last Thursday, but the
chances are that they have been detained
by the heavy northwest weather that has
prevailed off the coast. The Acapuleo
comes from Panama with New York
freight and passengers, while the San
Juan halls from Acapuleo with coffee and
general merchandise.
The steamer Centennial, under charter
to the United States Government for a
transport, has been bought by Captain
Charles Nelson. She is a very handy ves
sel, and as soon as Uncle Sam is through
with her she will be put in the coast
trade. Captain Nelson now has three ves
sels under charter to the Governmentâ
the Cleveland, Charles Nelson and Cen
tennial. The first two are on their wav
here from Manila and the Centennial will
sail for the Philippines on Monday next.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship ;
Company's Gaelic will not reach here un
til the 25th inst. She was scheduled to '
arrive here on the 19th, but was dam
aged in a storm and had to remain six j
days at Nagasaki for repairs. :.,â¢

Must Leave His Cottage.
John Hickey, who for twenty years or
more has occupied the picturesque little
cottage on the edge of the Buena Vista
Park Tract, has been notified by Superin
tendent McLaren that lie will be obliged
to move out at an early date, and that
the cozy house which has attracted the
attention of hundreds of passengers on
the Halght-street cars, must go down to
make room for improvements. Hickey
â¢has acted as a keeper for the park, and in
consideration of the valuable services
rendered In this way he has been allowed
to occupy the cottage rent free. The
house will be torn down to make room
for a new road.

POLICEMAN PHILLIPS
IS GLAD HE'S ALIVE
Police Officer Phillips Is congratulating
himself that he Is riot occupying a slab in
the Morgue.
Shortly after 3 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, while making his rounds, he discov
ered that the door of a cigar store owned
i.v W. Kraus at 70S Larkin street viae open.
Phillips entered the store, and after light
ing the gas went to the rear room, which
is occupied by Kraus and his wife. Mrs.
K rails heard him entering, and thinking
he was a burglar lustily shouted for the
police. Kraus was awakened by her
screams, and alsft concluding that tho
visitor was a desperate burglar he jumped
out of bed, and procuring his revolver
and a club started after the intruder.
By this time Phillip, had entered the
room and told the couple to keep quiet.
Evidently not recognizing the police offi
cer Kraus struck at Phillips with his
club. The officer Immediately grappled
with him and a struggle in the dark en
â sued. While the two men were struggling
for supremacy Mrs. Kraus recognized
Phillips and veiled to her husband to de
sist.
Kraus at once released his hold on the
officer and apologized for what he termed
his serious mistake. After cautioning the
merchant to keep his door locked in fu
ture Phillips left the store, well satisfied
with the fact that he was alive.

MAYOR SNOW
ON IMPROVEMENT
CLUBS' VALUE
Should Control the
Street Work.
â â
THE CITY'S ABOMINATION
â â
IT IS THE DISGRACEFUL CITY
HALL.
, pâ â
A Union of Clubs Looking to the Ad
vancement of Oakland Could
Do as Much as the Gov
ernment.
+
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, May 12.
Mayer Snow is making the round of the
many improvement clubs and impressing
upon each the necessity of working to
gether. Mr. Snow takes the stand that j
the policy hitherto adopted by the city i
government of Oakland has been one of !
hit or miss, and consequently the city has I
been practically robbed of huge sums of
money for which no returns have been i
made.
In the Mayor's address to the improve- i
ment clubs he says: "The taxpayers own
a City Hall that is an abomination, and
for the sole reason that it has never re- j
ceived proper care. Its entrance is a
monument of official neglect. No man
mounts the steps of it entertaining respect
for the city government if he has brought
!any thus far. The whole structure, in- j
side and out, has taken on an indecent
appearance, and the city government is
justly juelged by it. With fifteen hundred |
dollars now and a few dollars from time
to time, all this could be changed. If it
were your private property it would be
changed without talking about it."
The Mayor has an idea that there should
be certain "centers" established through
cut the business portions of the city. One
man should be appointed tor each of these
centers, whose duty it would be to attend
to all i in- small pairs in the roads In his !
little district. Regarding this plan the j
Mayor says:
"Now the idea that I bring to you is to
the end that this be done. That it be
done by putting the right mar. in each of
these cent* giving him a hammer, saw,
nails, broom, shovel, hoe and a hand
cart; a box of broken stone will be kept,
convenient for him, and his work and dis
trict mapped out. There are various ordi
nances that have been passed from time
to time to prevent nuisances in the streets.
Of these there will be copies furnished for ;
distribution to property owners. I would I
not expect everything, but these men may
be made special policemen and so furnish
the protection by day that is not now
had with the whole police force. With
the right men in these central districts a
great deal of work will be accomplished,
and what Is just now equally desirable
after so great neglect, the public will be
witnesses of the Improved condition of
those affairs with which they come in
daily contact.
"A word as to the cost. The wages of
twelve men will aggregate $600 per month,
or $7000 per year. We spend three times
this sum now. but in such Intermittent,
hit or miss manner that the city govern
ment gets no credit for doing anything
nt all.
"1 desire to recommend to the City
Council the adoption of the plan I have
outlined, and if you and other Improve
ment clubs think well of it and will give
it your indorsement we can secure the
needed legislation after July 1 and make
the city shine."
Mayor Snow is a firm believer in the
usefulness of improvement clubs. In this
connection he says: r.v =
"I have a plan of organization that I
want to submit to you. The possible di
vision of the city Into patrol districts, as
already mentioned, has suggested the
plan to my mind. Naturally clubs are or
ganize about business centers. There are
about twelve Improvement clubs of im
portance In this city already organized.
The plan is to first disband the Central
Club of two hundred, so-called, that was
organized somo time ago In the center of
the city to further the park project. Then
of the chosen representatives of each of
the mprovement clubs a new Central
Club shall Ice formed. Clubs may have
two, four or ten representative, as may
be determined. This representative club
will not initiate measures, but every
measure of more than local Importance
arising in any. local club will be referred
to the club of representatives for its con
sideration and approval.
"The Council and the whole city govern
ment will be naturally and rightly guid
ed by the conclusions of the Central Club
of Representatives and sec will the whole
city. Of course, this club win have It in
mind to do. large things that affect the
whole city, and which will need, as we
have learned, the favor of the entire city
to carry to a successful conclusion."
LOOKS TO HEAVEN
FOR HER REWARD
Hopes, of a Woman Who Placards
Holy Writ on Uncle Collis'
Local Trains.
OAKLAND, May 12.â A perfect exam
ple of Christian acts performed on this
mundane globe for which a reward is
expected in heaven Is presented in the
liberal and cheerful manner In -which
Holy Writ Is quoted on large placards in
Uncle Collis' local trains for the edifica
tion of passengers who reside In the vir
tuous precincts of Alameda County.
In each car, alongside of placard- con
taining advertisements of shoes, cigars,
whisky and races, appears a card read
ing:
"Seek ye the Lord while he may be
found; call ye upon him while he is near.
Isaiah lv:6.
"For what Is a man profited If he shall
gain the whole world and lose his own
BOUl; or what shall a man give in ex
change for his soul. Matthew xvi:26.
"Repent ye, therefore, and be converted
thai your Fins may be blotted out. Acts
111:19.
Passengers were loth to believe that
these kindly reminders of Christian doc
trine were ordered posted In the cars by
Uncle Collis. To-day the first clew to the
party responsible for the cards was ob
tained. It is a woman residing in Oak
land, but her name could not be obtained.
This woman called on Morton L. Cook,
who operates and manages the car adver
tising Industry, some weeks ago, and
when told that the cost for the full sys
tem would be (70 per month, she stated
Flu- wished her cards placed only in cars
running through Alameda, Oakland and
Berkeley. This, the advertiser told her.
would cost but $50. The bargain was
struck, and the woman explained the
Scriptures she wished quoted.
"But, madam; there surely cannot be j
any monetary returns to you from such !
advertising." quoth the advertiser.
"I know," replied the Oakland Chris
tian. "There's no reward here for me. i
I will take your terms for three months, !

Preacher's Salary Attached.
OAKLAND, May 12.â Rev. V. Marshall
Law, rector of the Church of the Advent,
East Oakland, has special reasons,
through big sealed documentary evidence,
to know that plumbers' bills come high,
particularly when not paid promptly.
Plumber Smith a few days ago was given
Judgment for $2 90 and costs against the
rector. The costs amounted to $10 and
Justice Larue issued a writ attaching
Rev. Mr. Law's salary and to-day the
custodian of the church's strong box was
served with the papers, and now $12 90
â will be taken out of the rector's salary
for this month.
PRETTY GIRLS TO
PLAY BASKETBALL
Members of the Alameda High School
. Team at Practice*
ALAMEDA, May 12.â Alameda society promises to turn out to-morrow to
witness the basket-ball game between teams representing the Alameda
High School and the Longfellow School. The game will be played on
the lawn on the premises of Mrs. George H. Mastick, Pacific avenue,
near Chapin street. Ropes will be stretched around the beautiful grounds and
a detail of police will guard the outer lines.
The teams had their last practice to-day, and played with a skill that in
dicates that to-morrow's game will be closely contested and will prove a most
exciting exhibition of the sport which Alameda society has adopted as Its
latest fad.
The game Is given for the benefit of the Alameda Women's Charitable
Association, an organization composed of the most prominent ladles in the
enclnal city's social circles, whose practical work in charity deserves the
heartiest commendation. Many suffering families have been succored and
numerous worthy men upon whom Dame Fortune has frowned have been tided
over their difficulties by the ladles of the association. Through their assist
ance the unemployed have secured positions and the sick and needy have
been carefully provided for.
Since January 1 of this year the society has distributed to needy families
144 pieces of clothing, twenty-five pairs of shoes and thirty-four sacks of
coal. Aside from this, twenty visits have been made to the sick, employ
ment has been found for the heads of four families . and eleven different
families have been provided with the necessities of life.
It is to raise funds to continue this good work that the basket-ball game
is to be given. All Alameda will attend, and It Is calculated that the spa
â¢ cious Mastick grounds will be taxed to the limit to accommodate the crowd.
Among the prominent society ladles Interested in the association are the
following: Mrs. S. A. O'Nell, president; Mrs. M. F. McGurn, secretary; Mrs.

the students whose four years' course is

Their celebration will consist of exercises

headed by a band from the Presidio, will
start on its pilgrimage of farewell. From
the oaks on the lower campus the proces

Swan is to make the address. From
there to all the college buildings in suc
cession the procession will move on, the

GROSS ERRORS
IN A PRECINCT
AT PIEDMONT
Miller Gaining in the
Recount.
â  t â
MAY HAVE BEEN ELECTED
â * â
HAS OVERCOME HALF OF HIS
MINORITY.
Â« .
All the Patronage of the City Gov
ernment Depends Upon the Re
sult of the Contest, Which
Is Getting Closer.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 12.
All the politicians, j office-holders and
placehunters became suddenly Interested
to-day in the Miller-Clement election con
test. During the progress of the recount
in the Second Ward a very grave errorâ
If not worseâ was discovered. In this one
precinct, which only contains 130 votes,
Mr. Miller gained twenty-nine. In the
Piedmont Precinct, which is. the sixteenth
in the Second Ward and one of the quiet
est and most respectable districts In the
city of Oakland, no one expected to find
any crookedness. In the Fourth and
Sixth wards Mr. Miller had alleged that
gross derelictions of duty had occurred,
but he was very modest in his claims of
miscounted votes in the conservative
Piedmont district. The discovery was like
a thunderclap In Judge Hail's courtroom.
Tlie election officers had tallied the votes
correctly and the tally sheets agreed with
the recount: "but on the return slip the
figures had been so changed that Instead
of leading by twenty-five votes Miller was
represented as being four behind. When
matters were straightened out Miller had
overcome at one clip three-eighths of his
entire minority. Another errorâ if it be
errorâ such as this will probably elect Mr.
Miller.
When the court closed last night there
were sixty-five ballots in the Sixth Ward
held out owing to the fact that they had
been numbered in lead pencil. This morn
ing the election officers proved to the sat
isfaction of the court that these marks
had been put on by the board during the
counting, and the ballots were admitted.
The election officers of the Piedmont
district who are responsible for the pecu
liarity of the returns are: Inspectors W.
T. Harris and E. R. Hill, Judges W.
O'Connor and J. H. Mochler, Clerks W.
Blair and S. J. Agnew, Ballot Clerks W.
B. Sanford and C. A. Surphlis.
They may be subpenaed to appear be
fore the court and explain the wide dis-
crepancy.
Should Mr. Miller be elected there will
be more excitement than over the whole
of the recent city election, for with Mr.
Dow he would at .once proceed upon such
a wholesale cleaning-out process that
there would hardly be anybody left at the
City Hall to tell the tale of what had
been. All through the campaign the cry
was "Dow and Miller." conveying the; Im
pression that Mayor Snow would be more
conservative and less likely to make a
combination than the other two Republi
cans. When Miller was defeated there
was big disappointment, and since the
new government took office and the
Mayor has shown no desire to turn things
upside down there has been much disap
pointment among the politicians. The
progress of the Miller-Clement contest ls
being hourly watched with great anxiety.
When the recount closed to-night Miller
had gained 41 votes out of 80. There are
only the Seventh and Fifth wards to be
counted. About 200 ballots are held ln re
serve, but they are about equally dis
tributed. ;
POSITION OF CABMEN.
Not Organized to Oppose the Plans of
Employers.
OAKLAND, May 12.â David Hughes,
the official reporter of the Carmen's So
cial and Benevolent Society, has written
to The Call stating that one paragraph
in a recent article on the hardships of
carmen does not agree with the facts,
i "The article In The Call," says Mr.
D. W. Landers, John Whiting. J. F.
Gassmann, E. B. Smith, M. Elssler, A.
C. Cooper, F. Rouxand, J. Raphael,
both sides being satisfied to go on
with the eleven. "Little Egypt" sat
. beside her attorney and was apparent
ly an object of curiosity to the jurors.
It was expected that she would be
asked to testify, but the crowd in the
court room was doomed to disappoint
ment.
The only witness examined was Po
liceman Esola, who testified to what
he saw the defendant do prior to plac
ing her under arrest. He was asked
to give an Imitation of the dance, but
blushlngly begged to be excused. It
was admitted. by the defendant's at
torney that the evidence of Policeman
Tyrrell would be the same as that of
Esola, and the prosecution rested. At
torney Dunne said he had no evidence
to offer, and the case was submitted
to the jury without argument. ;
The Jury retired, and after being out
about twenty minutes returned with a
verdict of acquittal. The peculiarity
of the verdict is that it is directly op
posed to the decision of Judge Conlan.
The Judge heard the case against the
woman the second time she was ar
rested and It was not nearly so strongs
as the case before the Jury, but the
Judge convicted her and sentenced
her to pay a fine of $100. That decision
was appealed from and is still pending
In the Superior Court. The cases of
the other dancers arrested with "Lit
tle Egypt" i are yet to be tried."
Hughes, "is correct as to the facts relat
ing to our having to put up a deposit and
to carry insurance. The last paragraph
is incorrect. It is true that there is an
organization of the carmen employed on
the various roads in Oakland, but they
are not organized for any antagonistic
purposes toward the people or their em
ployers. It is a beneficial society, pure
and simple, caring for its sick members
as would any other beneficial order. Poli
tics, religion or any business not connect
ed with the society is not tolerated for
a moment, and no one is authorized to
use the name of the society in that con
nection.
"Certain unscrupulous persons have en
deavored to- injure us In the community
and with our employers, but we have ab
solutely no desire to oppose the methods
of our employers, although we may not
all agree that they are just the right
thing. We wish to be set right on this
point."

COURT CLERK KELLY
AND J.N. E.WILSON
TO BE INDICTED
Held Responsible for the Re
lease of the "Strangler."
Investigation Reveals That Thomas Cos
grove, One of the Supposed Bonds
men, Is a Myth.
CLERK KELLY of Judge Graham's
court and Attorney J. N. E. Wilson
will be indicted by the Grand Jury
for their participation in the at
tempted escape of Harry "Wilson,
who was recently arrested on several
charges of petty larceny.
The colored man was taken Into cus
tody several weeks ago on suspicion of
being the strangler of May McDermott
end Bertha Para creatures of the
tenderloin, who were strangled to death,
presumably for the purpose of robbery.
Failing to connect Wilson with the hor- <

rlble crimes. Chief Lees, after ascertain- ,
Ing that he had robbed several women by
representing himself as a wealthty cattle
dealer of Montana, ordered three charges
of petty larceny to be placed against him.
He was convicted on each charge, and
committed to jail for eighteen months,
the maximum penalty.
The prisoner's attorney was J. N. E.
Wilson, who, the police say, was impli
cated in the escape of Gilbert Kendall, a
desperate counterfeiter. Kendall for some
unknown reason was taken from the City
Prison to Wilson's office, and during the
temporary obsence of a Deputy Sheriff,
who accompanied him, he jumped
through a window and made his escape.
THOMAS KELLY.
Wilson, the colored man, was taken be
fore the Grand Jury yesterday and read
ily consented to toll how he secured his
release on straw bonds.
"Attorney Wilson visited me in the City
Prison," he declared, "and after inform
ing me that I had been booked on three
charges of petty larceny, offered to de
fend me. I told him I was penniless, but
promised to reward him for his services
'as soon as I was set at liberty.'
"Immediately after I was convicted and
sentenced to eighteen months' Imprison
ment Wilson again .'islted me In my cell
ln the City Prison and asked me If I could
-**â¢Â« thrfe hundred dollars. He promised
Ito secure my release as soon fts that
1 amount was handed to him. I informed
i him that I had a friend, a woman, who
would gladly give that sum if he succeed
ed in having me released from jail. I as
sured him that if he arranged It so that
! I could get out, even for a short time,
I would take him to my friend's room
and personally see that he was given the
amount he asked for. Evidently realizing
that I meant what I said Wilson left me
after promising to return and take me
out on bonds. A few hours later he re
turned to the prison with the necessary
bonds. I was then taken out of my cell
and told that I was at liberty to go.
"As I left the prison Wilson followed
! me and asked if I Intended to keep my
promise as to the three hundred dollars he
was to receive for his services in securing
my release. â¢ I answered in the affirma
tive and together we went to my friend's
room on Fourth street, near Howard.
, She was surprised to see me, but after I
. had explained how I had been released on
bonds through the efforts of the attorney
she seemed satisfied.
"I informed her of my promise to pay
Wilson $300 and she at once went to her
trunk and. taking out three $100 bills,
handed them to him. He promptly ac
cented the money and shortly afterward
left the place.
"As he assured me that I was at lib
erty to go where. I pleased, I took the
j first train for Santa Cruz, intending to
i remain there a few days and then go to
Mex'co. Thinking that Wilson had
squared the cases against me as he rep
: resented, I was disagreeably surprised a
few days'later when a Constable arrested
! me on a dispatch from Chief Lees."
The colored prisoner tthen told how
! after he had been brought back to this
; city he was confronted with Wilson, the
attorney, in the presence of Captain Sey
mour and accused him of having thrown
j him down, as he expressed It.
"Did you give me any money to defend
you?" excitedly asked the attorney at the
! time. -
"Yes, I did; you got $300 from me and
then gave me the worst of It," retaliated
j the prisoner. v
J Wilson repeated this conversation be
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MAY 13, 1899.
fore the Grand Jury, and furthermore de
clared that the attorney begged him not
to tell the police that he had received a
cent for his services.
It was developed at the investigation
that the Thomas Cosgrove, who was sup
nosed to have qualified as one of the
bondsmen on Wilson's bond, is a myth.
As ex-Deputy Sheriff Riley, whose name
also appears on the bond, denies that It
is his signature, the police are morally
certain that somebody is guilty of forg
ery.
At the conclusion of the investigation
yesterday several of the grand jurors
were iin favor of indicting both Kelly
and Attorney Wilson. The , matter was
discussed at length, but it was finally de
cided to postpone action until next Mon
day. It is authoritatively said that at
the next meeting of the inquisitorial body
true bills will be found against the two
men.
Kelly does not bear a very good repu
tation. Some time ago he was arrested
by Detective Egan on suspicion of being
a pickpocket, but as the charge could not
be sustained he was released.
FRIEDLANDER AND
BELASCO MIX THINGS
THEATRICAL MANAGERS USE
ANGRY WORDS.
An Incident Not Down on the Bills
Furnishes Excitement for a
Deadhead Audience on
O'Farrell Street.
S. H. Friedlander. late of the firm of
Friedlander, Gottlob & Marx, and Fred
Belasco of the Alcazar furnished an ex
citing performance last night not down on
the bills. The audience, all deadheads,
was composed of people who happened to
be in the vicinity of that part of O'Far
rell street most brilliantly lighted by
theatrical stars.
Friedlander made his entrance P. D. Q.
from the corridor of the Alcazar to the
street, closely followed by Belasco, in the
role of the heavy villlan bent on r-r-r-re
venge. There was no mistaking the situa
tion. A wild and woolly melodrama could
not have been more realistic. Everybody
saw in an instant that- Belasco was a bad
Indian after the scalp of the pale-faced
fugitive. It looked to be all up with
Friedlander and the audience began to
hold its breath for the climax, when along
came a westbound car, just like the to-be
continued-in-our-next line in the "Boys'
and Girls' Own," to foil the villain. Fried
lander was saved. The last seen of him
he was loping up Powell street, far from
Belasco and the "Heart of the Tender
loin."
Exciting as was this scene, the previous
encounter between the theatrical mag
nates was more so. In It Friedlander is
said to have received a slap In the face
from Belasco and to have been aided in
his subsequent entrance on the street
scene by the muscular action of the Al
cazar n:antger. Up to the time of their
collision the two men had been good
friends. Belasco blames Friedlander for
having caused the breach. It seems that
Belasco & Thall have on the road a dra
matic company in which there are two
young men whom Friedlander was desir
ous of securing for some attraction in
which he was interested. With this end
in view he wrote the actors, offering them
an engagement. They, being novices at
the business. immediately forwarded the
letter to Belasco. Not hearing from the
young men. Friedlander, after a week or
so. wrote another letter, receiving in due
course a reply informing him that his
first letter had been forwarded to Belasco
and referring him to that gentleman for
information. Last night, according to all
accounts, Friedlander called on Belasco
for the purpose of assuring him that he
meant nothing wrong in writing as he
had. The act began and ended as stated.
BASEBALL TO-DAY.
Oakland and "Watsonville Teams to
Contest.
Watsonville will invade the local base
ball preserves to-day, and Manager Cal.
Ewing and his bunch of rejuvenated crip
ples have been busy all the week getting
themselves in readiness to give the sugar
growers a fitting welcome. The reception
will take place at Recreation Park, begin
ning at 3 o'clock, and a large time may be
confidently expected by those who are in
attendance. The Watsonvilles, . flushed
with their string of victories, declare that
nothing can stop them now, not even
Uncle Hank's constellation of sluggers,
and that nothing on the coast ever
equaled them in hitting and fielding.
During the week Oakland has made
some changes in its make-up that will
prove most beneficial and stops the only
leak in an otherwise water-tight Infield.
"Kid" Peeples. one of the best infielders
in the State, will play second and Dun
leavy will cover first, Shea, who is a good
outfielder and hard hitter but an indif
ferent pitcher, going into left garden. The
teams are practically tied for fourth posi
tion now, are evenly matched, and this
week's series between them will doubtless
be as close and exciting as any games I
ever played here. The line-up of the I
teams to-day is as follows: j
Oakland. Positions. Watsonville.
Hammond Catcher Hanson. i
Mosklman Pitcher Harper |
Dunleavy : First base Selna 1
Peeples Second base Plake
Lange Third base Brockhoff '
Schtrreer Shortstop McCarthy <
Hardie Right field Morrow
Donovan Center field Whelan i
Shea Left field Hayes
The final game of the Academic Ath
letic League baseball tournament for this
year's championship will be played at
Recreation Park this morning at 10 o'clock
sharp. The championship lies' between
Palo Alto and Stockton high schools, which
have qualified for the final. Both teams
have exceedingly good records and are
capable of putting up a fast and interest
ing game. W. W. Smith, who last year
was captain of Hoitt's team and of the
University of California, will umpire.
The famous old JESSE MOORE WHISKY Is
recommended by physicians for family and
medicinal use because it is pure.
ATTORNEY ACH THREATENS.
Informs Officers Esola and Tyrrell
That Their Admittance to the
Cafe Royal Will Be Barred.
Attorney Ach is determined that the
police must not bother his clients, Messrs.
Hornlein & Co., proprietors of the Cafe
Royal. He visited the place last even
ing and finding Officers Tyrrell and Esola
on guard he tersely Informed them that
if they tried to watch the tables to-night
they would have to break in with an ax.
He Insinuated that admission to the po
licemen would be barred.
On their return to the Southern station
the. officers reported what Mr. Ach had
said to Captain Spillane, and the latter
became indignant. He said he would send
both men to the gambling resort again
to-night and he did not think they would
find any difficulty in getting inside. Cap
tain Spillane was also informed that three
tables were occupied by card players dur
ing the evening, and although money was
not handled the percentage was used ln
buying rounds of drinks and packs of
cards. It is expected that there will be a
lively time in the cafe to-night.
SAM YUP BENEFIT.
The Jackson-Street Theater Crowded
With Chinese and Hundreds
Turned Away.
A special entertainment was given In |
the Jackson street theater last night by
the Sam Yups and it was so largely pat
ronized that it was found "necessary to
call for the assistance of the police to
keep back the crowds.
The theater will hold about 1500 white
men or about 2000 Chinese. The thrifty
Sam Yups managed to dispose of about
4000 tickets, and as a result at about 9
o'clock a notice was posted at the doors
that the house was filled and no more
people would be admitted. The Chinese
who held tickets kept crowding up to the
doors all night, and many of them, when
informed that they could not be admitted
made remarks which If translated would
be unfit for publication. They all held
tickets and naturally thought they were
victims of a bunko game.
The proceeds will be devoted to the Sam
Yup joss house on Waverly place.

A Big Convention of Interested
Organizations to Be Held.
California Water and Forest Society Takes the Initia

of Kindred Bodies.
AN executive meeting of the members
of several committees of the Cali
fornia Water and Forest Society
was held at the Merchants' Club
yesterday afternoon and steps were taken
for the holding of a big convention in
this city with the object of conserving
the waters of the State.
United States' Surveyor General J. M.
Gleaves, president of the organization,
was chairman, and there were present
Colonel J. P. Irish of the executive com
mittee; Professor George Davidson, chair
j man of the committee on flood waters and

i committee on printing and publication;
Hugh Craig of the committee on organi
zation; ex-Mayor Pond; F. W. Dohrmann,
president of the Merchants' Association;
William Thomas, M. Hopkins and Mayor
! Phelan, who had been invited to attend
I the conference.
A general discussion was had as to
I the surest means of getting the sentiment
i of the people at large in regard to the
I best plan to utilize the waters of the
I State, when and where needed, In order
i to bring about the conservation of the
( watersheds and forests. Some practical

subject had been thoroughly gone Into

The purpose of this convention will be

THE NEW SUPREME
COURT COMMISSIONER
THE Supreme Court Justices yesterday appointed James A. Cooper as Supreme
Court Commissioner, vice E. J. Pringle, deceased. The new Commissioner
is a member of the law firm of Cooper & Knight, who have offices in the
Mills building, â¢'
Mr. Cooper has been a resident of this city only for the past nine months, his
former home being in Ukiah, Mendocino County, where for twenty-one years he
practiced law. He comes from an old and well known Southern family of North
Carolina. Leaving the South at an early age he went to Kansas, but the future
of that State did not appeal to him. and In 1576 he came to this State, settling
at Uklah. For a long time he read Jaw in the office, of Judge Thomas of Santa
Rosa, Judge Thomas being then a law partner of Judge (now Justice) Temple.
Judge Temple appointed the young lawyer to the position of Court Commissioner
of the old District Court, the only public office Mr. Cooper ever held.
Since then he has been offered several positions, but his practice was too val
uable to be abandoned. He was associated with H. E. Highton in the celebrated
"King" White divorce case, appearing for the wife. Soon after the election of Gov
ernor Budd the position of Code Commissioner was offered to Mr. Cooper, but he de
clined with thanks. Shortly before he came to this city Mr. Cooper was one of
the directors of the Bank of Ukiah. He has been a delegate several times to the
Democratic State Convention. Since his residence in this city Mr. Cooper has
made his home at the Hotel Pleasanton with his family, consisting of a wife,
son and daughter. The son is now at Harvard College. During the summer the
family resides at Sausallto.
The Supreme Court Justices have renewed the appointments of the former
Court Commissioners, which. now consist of John Haynes, N. P. Chipman,
Wheaton A. Gray, E. W. Britt and J. A. Cooper. The secretary of the commis
sion was not named.
Town Talk.
A feature of Town Talk to-day is the
problem story signed "The Metaphysi
cian," in which a peculiar moral upheav
al Is dramatically pictured. The World
of Letters' is exceptionally interesting,
Hllalre Belloc and his works, and "ma
chine-made- authors" being discussed.
The Saunterer talks about the latest
ideas in weddings, an amusing mistake
made by two Marine Hospital doctors, a
story about Clara Foltz, an international
swapping of chorus girls, and Professor
I Alfred Benzon, the card manipulator; also
I gives the latest news in society, politics
j and the clubs. Clever jokes, amateur
| sporting news, chat about law and law
yers, criticisms on Clay Greene's play and
| "On and Off" Musical matters are given
I more space than is devoted to them by
j any other, newspaper on the Pacific
Coast. The editorials are on such timely
I subjects as Chris Buckley, the gas com-
I pany, the Dreyfus case, Roosevelt vs.
| Funston, and the latest inventions in
j punctuation. Town Talk, only 10 cents,
| at all newsdealers. â¢
Purged of Contempt.'
The. proceedings against the Board of
I place until next week, as there are 362
| commercial organizations throughout the
! State which will have to be notified.
j Enough time will be given to insure the
; attendance of a large representation.
President Gleaves announced the ap
pointment of Hugh Craig, former presi
dent of the Chamber of Commerce, as a
member of the executive committee ot
the society to succeed William C. Ralston,
who has resigned on account of pressure
of other business.
Mr. Gleaves presented a history of the
Water and Forest Society from its incep
tion down through the successive stages
of legislation, and bespoke for it great
success. When seen in regard to the pro
posed convention, he said:
."The water and forestry question is of
momentous import to California's best in
terests, and this convention will be an Im
portant one for that reason, as it will
deal in a practicable manner with the
problem which confronts us. The whole
subject at the present time is a matter
for investigation solely. The plan for
bonding the State for the purposes of
water conservation will be thoroughly
considered in all its phases, and much
good will result therefrom. . It Is but just
that posterity should assist in paying for
the benefits that will certainly accrue by
a proper solution of the problem. The
last Legislature passed a bill appropriat
ing $10,000 for the work, but It failed to
get through in time. By the holding of a
convention the necessity of State aid will
become apparent.
"The various committees of the society
report progress in its affairs. Chairman
J. M. Walling of the executive commit
tee, Julian Sonntag of the finance com
mittee, Edward F. Adams of the com
mittee on organization, John P. Irish of
.the committee on forestry, Professor
George Davidson of the flood waters and
reservoir committee. E. W. Hilgard of
the committee on distribution of waters
and Curtis H. IJndley of the committee
on legislation .have all been performing
yeoman service in the good cause, and re
port a growing interest In the objects for
which the society was organized."
Education to declare that body in con
tempt of court for its refusal to properly
audit the demands of E. C. Kilpatrick
was dismissed without prejudice by Judge
Hunt yesterday. In view of a recent de
cision of the Supreme Court. Judge Hunt
held that the contempt proceedings were
insufficient and that the proper proceed
ing would be to mandamus the board.
Hence the case at bar. was dismissed that
the proper proceeding might be instituted
against the board by the plaintiff to re
: cover his salary, held to be due by Judge
I Hunt in : a former proceeding.

Players Are Provided With Re
freshments for Checks
* Taken.
â¦
The trial of H. A. Hornlein, proprietor
of the Cafe Royal, before a. jury in Judge
Mogan's court yesterday on the charge of
permitting a percentage game of poker
j to be played in his place, resulted in a
I disagreement, eleven being for acquittal
[ and one for conviction. -j -.": v;
The evidence was noteworthy in the
fact that Policeman Hemenez made a
very poor witness, and had to be con
stantly led by either Prosecuting Attor
ney Joachimsen or the Judge, against At
torney Ach's constant objections; . and
also in Sergeant M. J. Conboy's definition
of the word "percentage," which was
startling.
Hemenez testified to having entered the
cafe on the night of April 24. On going
to the rooms reserved for poker he saw
five men playing with chips. A man
named Berry, or Barry, was standing be
hind one of the players, and when each
player put in his ante Barry took out a
chip as a "rake off." Hemenez admitted
not being familiar with a percentage
game. After seeing two games played he
notified Sergeant Conboy and the sergeant
and Officers Heffernan, Donovan and
Murphy came into the poker room and
stood looking on while two other games
were played. Then the players were ar
â¢rested. In cross-examination Hemenez
said he did not see a card reading. "Un
lawful Games Prohibitedâ Minors Not
Allowed," nor did he see a card contain
ing the rules of the game.
. Sergeant Conboy corroborated Hemen
cz's testimony, and said positively that a
percentage game was being played. On
cross-examination he said he had read
law and knew the meaning of percent
age. It meant a commission or allow
ance, and on being further pressed he
said It meant a commission for services
rendered or a commission in the army.
Ach pressed him. so hard on that point
that he lost his temper and warned Ach
not to try and make a fool of him. He
admitted he had never heard the game
called a percentage game until the ar
rests were made. He saw no cigars,
drinks or sandwiches given to the play
ers.
The defendant took the stand and tes
tified that the chips taken by the con
ductor of the game were for drinks, ci
gars or sandwiches to the players, and
for the use of the room and cards. He
had no intention of violating the law,
and before he allowed poker to be played
in the rooms three years ago he asked
permission from Captain Spillane. and
the captain had* told him it would be
all right. Captain Spillane was sent
for, and he frankly admitted that he had
j told Hornlein it would be all right, but at
that time he did not know that poker
playing for a percentage was illegal.
This ended the testimony, and after the
addresses of counsel and the Judges
charge the jury retired, and after being
out for about two hours they announced
that they could not agree. They stood
eleven for acquittal and one for convic
tion. â¢. -. â  â  . _, â¢ .
The case was continued until Monday
to be again set for trial along with the
other cases.

FAINTED AT HIS POST.
ALAMEDA, May 12.â The first plans ot
the new Board of City Trustees toward
economizing in the management of the
electric light works have miscarried. The
force was reduced, and those who held
their positions were compelled to do duty
for upward of fourteen hours a day. This
afternoon J. O. -lesser, the, engineer,
fainted at his post. When he was able he
notified the City Trustees that he could
not stand the strain and would resign his
position. Under the new arrangement he
was forced to do the wiper's work in ad
dition to his duties as engineer. Had he
fainted during the night shift, when his
engine was running, the valuable ma
chinery of the electric light plant might
have been ruined before his condition was
discovered. To-night the plant is being
run by A. V. Fisher, who was formerly
wiper, but who was promoted to the posi
tion of collector and bookkeeper.
