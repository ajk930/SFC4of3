BOOKMAKERS ARRESTED AT THEIR VICIOUS GAME
Exciting Scenes
at the Race
Course.
Gamblers Freed
by an Officious
Clerk.
The Municipal Authorities
Are Indignant Over
the Unseemly
Affair.
Yesterday was a day of varied inci
dent for the authorities of San Fran
cisco and for the blackleg horde that
has invaded the city and is living in
evil success upon the people. Early in
the morning Chief of Police Lees or
dered that a corps of police, numbering
fifty men, be placed in readiness, under
Captains Wittman and Gillen, to pro
ceed to the Ingleside racecourse. The
police official? assembled at their sta
tions shortly after 2 o'clock and waited
for the order to move to the racecourse.
The order was not long delayed and in
a few minutes the men, under the per
â onal direction of Chief of Police Lees,
â were on the way.
In the meantime the gamblers of Itv
grleside had not been idle. Consultations
had been held down town and a plan
of campaign had been outlined. The
Oakland contingent loaned Henry Ach
to th" Ingleside people as a legal ad
viser and Ach pressed James Lone into
the service of his clients. Ed Corrigan,
Ach. Secretary Green and the private
detectives employed by the racing
gamblers held a conference and it was
determined to fight. The bookmakers
vere not consulted at that time, as the
managers of the track wished to avoid,
technically at least, the offense of of
ficially permitting the gamblers to
operate at the track.
After the conference several tele
phone messages were sent and the re
eult of one of them was that John P.
Bice, clerk in Police Judge Conlan's
Court, appeared at the racecourse be
fnre the first race. The presence of
Bice in his official capacity at the track
is denounced by members of the Board
of Supervisors, by Police Judge Conlan
and by the police as an unwarranted
outrage. Rice was to act as the tool
of Corrigan and the gamblers. The
Police Court clerk came well supplied
With blank orders of release for the ex
pected emergency of the afternoon. He
took upon himself to abuse the author
ltiy with which the Supervisors have
clothed him as a clerk of the Police
Court.
Shortly before the time came for the
opening of books on the first race the
bookmakers went to the office of the
eecretary and asked what they should
-do. They were told to open their books
!and accept bets as the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club would protect them and
".would supply bonds for their release if
they were arrested. The managers of
the association thus placed themselves
under the operation of the law and
made themselves liable to arrest, which.
"by the leniency of the police, they es
caped. The bookmakers, touts, gam
blers and jockeys were not so fortu
nate.
An expectant crowd was furnished
â¢with several interesting events not on
the card. Twenty arrests were made
tor violation of the new anti-pool law
passed by the Board of Supervisors
Monday. Fifty policemen marched into
the betting ring and under direction of
Chief Lees the first step to remove the
curse of the city was taken. The men
arrested were:
SAM SHAEN, blockman for
George Rose's field book.
H. L. JONES, booking under thÂ«
name of Stuyvesant Ciub (Johnny
Coleman's b<->ok).
LOUIS SANDERSON, time-keeper.
H. NATHAN, clerk.
JAMES WILSON, waiter.
AL CONEY, horseman.
ABE ENKLE, bookmaker.
JAMES NEAL, horseman.
CHARLES SCOTT, bookmaker's
clerk ("Scotty" Rottenstein).
M. JACOBS, official pool-buyer

JOE REID, clerk for Bookmaker
Humphries.
JOE LEVY, cashier for Barney
Behreiber.
ADOLPH DENNERY, horseman.
CHABLES LEW, bookmaker

JAMES REILLY, bookmaker.
HARRY HINTON, pool-buyer.
ABE LEVY, bookmaker (auction

FRANK WALL, messenger.
THOMAS GREEN, valet ("Ging
er" Green, valet for Joe Narvaez).
JO OPPENHEIMER, bookmaker
(ex-pool-buyer).
In anticipation of a sensation more
than the usual number of persons went
to thr- trark. The announcement that
the new law would be rigidly enforced, j
The San Francisco Call.
POLICE RAID INGLESIDE AND ENFORCE THE LAW
THE gamblers of Ingleside intend to fight for the vicious privilege which the people of San Francisco, in
defense of their most sacred interests, have destroyed. When the ordinance prohibiting bookmaking
and poolselling was signed by the Mayor it became operative. The gamblers of the racecourse knew
this fact, as they have attorneys who know the law. In defiance of the law, however, the managers of Ingle
side instructed the gamblers not to interrupt their trade at the track, and the result was a remarkable
scene at the racecourse. A series of arrests was made and prosecutions in the Police Court will follow.
Chief of Police Lees says he will enforce the law, and the gamblers declare that they will not submit. The
contest is one of the greatest that was ever fought in the city, as the issue is one perfectly defined be
tween morality and corruption.
by the Police Department drew many !
non-frequenters to the betting ring.
The gamblers, 'too, were there en
masse. The?* 1 fastidious parasites, hav
ing been informed by their attorneys
that wholesale arrests were to be
made, provided themselves with sub
stitutes who were willing to take a ride
in the patrol wagons and suffer the in
convenience of arrest. The real cul
prits, by placing straw men on the bet
ting stands, saved their sensitive souls
from the annoyance of having the
heavy hand of a just law interrupt
their nefarious trade.
These sleek, smooth bookmakers
have been party to innumerable trag
edies, far greater than the mere ar
rest of a person for misdemeanor, and
perhaps they feared a guilty conscience
! would recall too many ruined men and
i women if they should, even for an
hour, be detained behind prison bars.
Three or four of the leading gam
blers decided to quit before the police
arrived. The season at Ingleside is
nearly ended, these men have made a
good clean-up, and they did not wish
to have their departure for the East
with the misspent money of their
I dupes deferred by a case in court. Be
fore the first race the bookmakers vis-
ited Secretary Green of the Jockey Club
to ascertain what to do.
They were informed that the police
were en route to the track, to raid the
betting ring. The association attor
ney guaranteed to furnish bail and
orders of release for all who might be
arrested, arid at the request of Mr. Ach.
the attorney, several bookmakers
agreed to continue business and sub
mit to arrest, in order to furnish cases
to test the validity of the ordinance
passed by the Supervisors. The book
makers did not go into their stands,
but sent their clerks and sheet writers
to the sacrifice. About 3 o'clock, just
before the third race was called, the
loud-voiced announcer shouted: "There
are 200 police outside the gate." Then
the excitement of the day began. Sev
eral of the more timid "bookies" went
out of business instantly. They pulled
down their slate?, destroyed, sheet?,
pocketed the contents of the cash
boxes and jumped into the ring.
In the midst of the bustle and hurry
two squads of police, headed by Chief
Lees, Captain Wittman, of the Central
District, and Captain Gillen of the
Seventeenth-street Station, marched
into the betting ring. Lawyer Ach ap
proached the Chief and inquired what
he intended to do. Chief Lees declared
he was there to stop pool selling, and
would arrest any person selling or
purchasing a pool ticket.
When the officers entered the betting
ring, and while the Chief was consult
ing with Mr. Ach, the crowd of touts,
stable boys and racetrack derelicts
jeered and hooted at the bluecoats.
All sorts of vile and obscene epithets
were hurled at the bluecoats. and un
fortunately they were obliged to re
ceive the insults without retaliating.
"With a foreknowledge that a pliant
Police Court Clerk was on the ground
to accept any old bond and issue an
order of release several bookmakers
resumed business. Stool pigeons had
been instructed to purchase tickets,
and then the fun began. Before any
arrests were made, however, Billy Bev
erly, Joe Rose, Hoffmann & Co. and
Gus Bluhm pulled down their signs and
left the ring. George Rose's field book
started to do business, and Sam Shaen,
the blockman, and H. Nathan, the
sheet writer, were taken into custody.
Nathan neglected to obey instructions
from his boss and had his sheet tacked
to a board. â  He endeavored to destroy
the record of bets, and the officers, see
ing the attempt to destroy evidence,
used force, burst into the stand and
secured possession of the sheet. Nath
an was roundly cursed by Shaen for
his stupidity in furnfshing the authori
ties with evidence. Nathan and Shaen
were jollied from all sides of the ring,
and then the chaff became general as
additional arrests were made.
Hughy Jones, who had charge of
Johnny Coleman's book, was the next
"martyr to the police persecution." He
did not relish his position In the least,

on Barney Rchreiber's stand, and from
that time on until the last race was run
every person attempting to violate the
law was instantly arrested.
James Wilson, a waiter, and Louis
Sanderson, a timekeeper, were ar
rested for buying pool-tickets, and
Phacn, Nathan and Jones were taken to
the Seventeenth street police station in
a patrol wagon. They were booked,
searched and placed in the dark, dank
cell, where they remained for over an
hour, before Jimmy Long, the Police
Court lawyer, arrived with a bundle of
blank orders of release which Judge
Conlan's clerk. Rice, had so accommo-
datingly prepared. These orders wore
signed but no names filled in. This
was Long's part of the work. Thanks
to Rice's system there was nothing to
prevent Long releasing every prisoner
in the City Prison who is not charged
with a felony. Long apologized to his
clients for not getting to the police sta
tion ahead of them, and he abused the
driver of the patrol wagon for hurrying
the gamblers to jail.
When the prisoners left Ingleside
Chief Lees telephoned to the sergeant
at the Seventeenth-street station to
search every one of them for evidence.
This was considered a gross indignity

Interrupted by the Police.
by the racetrack men, but they had to ,
submit.
While the first wagon was on the way
to the police station more arrests were
being made at the track, and Long and
his liberated clients awaited the ar
rival of the second load, which consist
ed of seven more "horsemen." These
men were booked and discharged rap
idly, and by the time they were dis
posed of eight more were brought in by
the two other wagons which were sent
to the track.
The last arrests were made during
the fifth race and none of the prisoners
cut much figure at the track or else
where. Two or three of the latter
bunch, at the instigation of Lawyer
Ach, endeavored to play a joke on the
police and at the same time cloud the
legal issue in court. Charles Lew
mounted a box and stuck up a racing
card several days old and Abe Levy
put in a "marker" on one of the horses.
Lew handed Levy an old ticket and at
this point both were arrested. Attor
ney Ach will raise the point that these
men and the others are not guilty of
any infraction of the law as no money
was passed.
During the last race open bookmaking
was not attempted, but the more prom
inent gamblers were accommodated in
the ring by the bookmakers. No money
was exchanged and no tickets written.
The bookman gave odds to his old pa
trons and the sports put in markers.
The day at the track ended quietly,
considering the unusual incidents. After
the last race was run Chief Lees and
Captains Wittman and Gillen went to
the Seventeenth-street station to see
what was done with the prisoners.
When the Chief learned that Police
Court Clerk Rice had issued a job lot
of release orders to accommodate the
jockey club lawyers he became very
indignant. He informed Long that no
more orders of that character would be
accepted by the police and he told Cap
tain Wittman to issue instructions to
that effect. At 6 o'clock all the Ingle
side prisoners had left the police sta
tion. They will appear in Judge Con
lan's court this morning at 10 o'clock.
Tho incidents at the racetrack yos
terday afternoon have created wide
spread commont in local official circles.
The presence and obnoxious activity of
Clerk Rice have particularly aroused
indignation. Chief of Police Lees de
clares that Rice had no right to do as
he did and no such procedure will be
accepted in the future. The arrests
will be made in a proper way and re
leases will be secured in a legal way.
In discussing the outrage last nignt
Police Judge Conlan said:
I am informed that the clerk of my
court went to the Ingleside race track
yesterday afternoon and accepted and
issued blank bonds in the cases of a
number of bookmakers and sheet-
writers who were arrested for violat
ing the betting ordinance passed by
the Board of Supervisors Monday
last.
If the bonds and orders of dis
charge were blank at the time of their
issuance they were clearly and un
doubtedly illegal, and therefore void.
The clerk is appointed by the Board
of Supervisors, and, unfortunately, is
responsible only to them for such ac
tions.
I as Judge have absolutely no con
trol over him or his actions outside of
my courtroom. I did not authorize,
| under any circumstances, his pres
ence there to accept such bonds, and
it was without my knowleoge that he
was there. Furthermore, I particular
ly do not countenance, and I disap
prove of his actions in signing such
orders of release. I am remarkably
' surprised, however, that the police
i did not realize that a clerk had no
! right to fix the amount of bail in
such cases. I cannot understand why
the police, knowing the law as they
do, should accept the orders under
1 the circumstances under which they
were presented.
It also has come to my knowledge
that certain comments have been
made in reference to the probable dis
position of these cases should they
come up in my court. I have not as
yet received a copy of the ordinance
nor have I perused its contents. In
the event of the cases coming up be
[ fore me I will give the accused a fair j
trial, fair play and at the same time
see that the law is upheld.
Members of the Board of Supervisors
declare that the action of Rice has
aroused them to the necessity of re
organizing that part of the Police
Court system over which they have
control. They appoint the clerks, and
do not intend that their employes sha'l
abuse their authority to bring into con
tempt local laws. The Chief of Police
declares that he will not only refuse
to accept bonds as they were given yas
terday, but he will investigate thor
oughly the character of the bonds that
have already been given. The affair
has created widesperad indignation.
To-day the gamblers will again ply
thr ir trade, and again they will be ar-
rested. The police will act until they
are stopped i>y the courts. It is left
to the gamblers to determine how the
final test shall be made.
It has been the custom of the police
to arrest the clerk in poolrooms who
sold the tickets to the officer making
the complaint, but yesterday it was de
cided to arrest the proprietors of the
poolrooms also, and Policemen Esola
and Tyrrell, after obtaining the neces
sary warrants, arrested Henry
Schwartz, Fourth and Market streets:
John Glynn, of Broyer <fc Glynn. 276
Stevenson street and Fourth and Mis
sion street (two charges), and John
Connolly, of Dunn & Co., 206 Steven
son street. They each gave $100 cash
bail and were released.
GAMBLERS DEFIANT.
Secretary Green of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club is beginning to show signs
of the strain he has been under during
the past few days. In the absence of
President Androus and through the Ill
ness of Director Crocker the burden of
the emergency has fallen on his should.
ers. Last night he and Ed Corrigan
were in consultation for nearly two
hours and when the latter left Mr.
Green stood by his desk with a wearied
and worried look on his face.
The secretary was loth to make any
statement for publication, but in the
course of an interview said: "Acting
on the advice of our attorney, Henry
Ach, we will race at Ingleside to-mor
row and even sell pools on the results.
We appreciate the fact that the public
does not attend the races for pleasure,
but for the purpose of betting.
"The action of the Supervisors came
as a thunderbolt to us. We have great
interests at stake and we don't think
the board treated us rightly. In fact
they ignored us completely. We have
not as yet decided to go across the bay
and finish our season. We can do so,
but on the advice of our attorney we
intend staying in this city and await
developments. Mr. Ach will appear in
court to-morrow and represent our as
sociation and we have full confidence
in his ability to defend our position. At
present I am unable to make any
further statement, but may do so here
after." ._.
CORRIGAN IS SILENT.
Ed Corrigan was in close consultation
with Secretary Green of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club last night and when
the "Iron Chancellor" of the racing
world left the rooms of the organiza
tion in the Palace he wore a troubled
look.
He declined to say anything for pub
lication, but declared that The Call had
Â£}V;ea iiim a lot fit jtrpuble and .was in*
juring him in a business way. Mr.
Corrigan then retired to his room, leav
ing word with the hotel clerk to be
sure and have him called at 6 o'clock
sharp.

BE ATTEMPTED

ramento for Relief.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. March 14.â An attempt is to
be made to induce the Legislature to
pass a law that will nullify the or
dinance pasÃed by the Board of Super-
visors and which prohibits the selling
of pools or bookmaking'on horse races
within the corporate limits of San
Francisco. In order to make the at
tempt successful the 520,000 raised by
the racetrack people to defeat the or
dinance in San Francisco is to be
brought to Sacramento and distributed
where it will do the most good.
Ex-State Senator Androus, presi
dent of the Ingleside racetrack, has
been in Sacramento several days look
ing after poolroom and racetrack legis
lation, and he is still on the ground
and will remain here for the purpose of
furthering any legislation that may
be introduced for the purpose of
thwarting the will of the people of the
metropolis as expressed by the action
of the Board of Supervisors yesterday.
To-day Vice President Henry J.
Crocker of the Ingleside racetrack cams
up from the city for the purpose of as
sisting Androus in the effort to induce
the members of the Legislature to rush
through some bill that will legalize the
Ingleside gambling game.
It is generally understood that the
present session of the Legislature will
be brought to an end on Saturday of
this week in spite of the fact that there
is much important legislation pending
that cannot and will not be reached on
the Assembly and Senate flies.
To introduce a new measure at this
time would be equivalent to consign
ing it to oblivion unless there is be
hind it a sufficient amount of money
to purchase for it the consideration
and immediate attention of legisla
tors. It is a matter of common knowl
edge that a fund of $20,000 was
raised to defeat the anti-pool selling
ordinance in San Francisco. It is also
known that the greater portion of
this sum of money was not and could
not be used because of the incorrupti
bility of the Supervisors whom the
race track people sought to corrupt.
It is this money that is to be brought
to Sacramento and used as an induce
ment to legislators who have been
working without pay for two weeks to
vote for some measure that will have
for its purpose the legalizing of the
gambling game that the people of the
metropolis are trying to suppress.
"Mo" Gunst arrived in Sacramento
to-night for the purpose, it is said, of
interesting himself in proposed meas
ures for rehabilitating the gambling
game in San Francisco. He will lead
the gambling and poolselling brigade
in the endeavor that, is to be made to
defeat local legislation in the metropo
lis. Much comment is being indulged
in respecting the propriety of one of
San Francisco's Police Commissioners

blers in a bold attempt to defeat the.

After such a decided expression of

MR. HOBART'S FUTURE
UNDER DISCUSSION

NEW YORK. March 14.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: The question whether Vice-
President Hobart shall he renominated

during the sojourn of President McKinley
with Mr. Hobart and Senator Hanna at
the latter's winter home in Thomasville,
Ga. The matter was under discussion at
the White House last Sunday night be
tween the President and one or two of his
Cabinet advisers, and it was quite evident
from the President's utterances he ia

league upon the Presidential ticket. There
are between Mr. McKinley and Mr. Ho

With the President agreeable to Mr.
Hobarfs renomination, and with Mr. Ho
bart willing again to stand for election,
with Senator Hanna entertaining a high
personal regard for the Vice-President
and with the Cabinet officers of the same
opinion, it might be taken for granted
that Mr. Hobarfs renomlnation Is as
sured This would undoubtedly be tha
case were it not for the unbroken precr

RIFLES FOR REBELS
HIDDEN IN COFFINS
CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 14.âAn
drew L. Loeber of Company M, Four
teenth United States Infantry, now at
Manila, writes a most interesting let
ter to his parents in this city concern
ing the attempt of the rebels to cap
ture the city on January 11. Among
other things the writer says:
"The insurgents tried to take the city
by making an attack in the front and
have the citizens make an attack in
the rear, so in order to do this it was
necessary for them to get arms into
the city. We noticed they were having
a large number of funerals from a
church in Paco. One day there were
seventy-three coffins taken in. When
Borne of our boys were detailed to in
spect they found that these coffins con
tained guns and in this way we cap
tured 1200 of the weapons.
WASHINGTON GOVERNMENT
WILL SUSTAIN OTIS
WASHINGTON, March 14.â General
Otis, in forbidding further negotiations
between the Spanish at Manila and the
insurgents touching the^ surrender of
the Spanish prisoners held by the lat
turning the vehicle. When the driver was
t^trieated from under the wrecked stage
he was unconscious, but it was found he
was not seriously injured. T. J. Vander

one of four passengers on the stage, was
badly bruised.
Kipling Much Improved.
NEW YORK. March 14.â Rudyard Kip
ling was feeling 1 very well to-night and
;iskf<l Mr. Doubleday a number of ques
tions. During the conversation Mr.
Doubloday happened to mention, the
"death watch" which the reporters had
kept on Mr. Kipling, using their own ex
pressioiL The poet was interested at
and asked for all the details. Dr.
Dunham to-night thought he would per

ter, acted on his own authority. The
Government has not sent him any in
structions upon this point, but it will
unquestionably support him to the ex
treme in any action he may take. It
is said at the State Department that
there have been exchanges between the
United States and Spain through in
direct channels touching these particu
lar prisoners, dating back to the signa
ture of the protocol last August. The
United States Government undertook
finally to secure the release of the pris
oners. It never contemplated trying to
secure their release by ransom, but
simply through the suppression of the
insurrection, and cannot be held by ai v
requirement of international law to do
more than has been done to secure the
release of the prisoners. There will lie
no relaxation of the efforts in this di
rection, but as the United States cam
paign in the Philippines is being con
ducted with all the energy possible,
and as the release of the prisoners de
pends upon the issue of that campaign,
there can be no complaint of failure
on the part of the United States to
meet its obligations.
In preventing the Spanish Govern
ment from negotiating directly with
the insurgents, it is said here, General
Otis was undoubtedly correct in his at
titude. Inasmuch as the ratification
of the peace treaty has not been ef
fected, the United States and Spain are
technically in a state of war, qualified
only by the operation of the protocol
suspending hostilities. In this condi
tion there is no authority on the part of
the Spaniards to negotiate with the in
surgents without the explicit consent
of the United States. Under the rules
of war alone there would be still ample
warrant for any action General Otis
might take calculated to prevent the
insurgents from receiving supplies of
food, clothing, munitions of war or
money, for the latter can always, with
more or less difficulty, be resolved into
the former, even in the face of a block
ade. If the Spanish Minister of For
eign Affairs feels called upon to ad
dress himself respecting this subject
to the State Department, directly or
indirectly, he undoubtedly would be
informed that General Otis must be
sustained, though reassured as to the
intentions of the United States to use
all proper efforts to carry out its un
dertaking.

REBELS ACTIVE
IN COSTA RICA
Loyalty of Troops Saves
Iglesias.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 14.â Passengers
on the steamer Altai, which arrived
here to-day, after touching a week ago
at Port Limon, had much to say about
the recent attempt to overthrow the
rule of President Iglesias of Costa Rica.
This occurred on February 25 at San
Jose, the seat of government. It was
briefly reported by cable several days
later, but owing to the vigilance of th(;
censorship maintained the causes were
not given. According to the general
opinion of the passengers of the Altai,
the condition of the Iglesias govern
ment is by no means assured.
A passenger apparently well able to
judge the conditions in Costa Rica, but
who refused to allow his name to be
used on account of his large business
connections in that republic, after re
ferring to the continued absence
abroad of Iglesias, which he attributed
to the President's desire to put Costa
Rica on a gold basis, described the re
cent outbreak somewhat as follows:
"Iglesias left his aged father, Senor
Don Detrio, in charge, while he himself
came to the United States and thence
went to Europe, where he now is. The
malcontents took advantage of the
President's absence to hatch a few
plots. Dr. Flores Is an open aspirant
to Presidential honors. His military
sponsor, General Velardo, on the 25th,
followed by about fifty armed men,
gained an entrance to the artillery bar
racks at San Jose. One of General Ve
â¢lardo's sons was in charge of the guard
at the time when the insurgents en
tered.
"There* were 300 soldiers in the bar
racks. It was understood that the ad
mission of the rebels was to be followed
by the surrender of the government
forces and the turning over of the arms,
but the plot miscarried and the rebels
walked into an ambuscade. Colonel
Antilon, who was in command of the
government force, headed his men and
a fight ensued. General Velardo waa
wounded, one of his sons was killed and
two other sons were made prisoners.
The son who had endeavored to turn
over the barracks to his father was
tried by court-martial and shot. The
other brother is now in prison awaiting
trial for treason. In the fight at the
barracks several other soldiers were
killed, including Colonel Antilon.
"General Velardo and his chief sup
porters escaped. The rebels are now
reported to be preparing to attack San
Jose, and are getting arms from the
neighboring republics. The people of
Nicaragua, vexed at the stand taken
by Iglesias in opposition to the canal
grant to the Grace syndicate, are sup
porting the Costa Rica rebel*.
"The signal for the outbreak of the
revolution was the assassination of
Colonel Arryo, one of the military com
manders of the place, who was killed
in the public street. General Velardo
until recently owned a large silk shawl
factory, which was mysteriously
burned. He charged that incendiaries
in the employ of government officials
destroyed the factory. As a result of
this attempted coup d'etat the 200,000
inhabitants of San Jose are now under
martial law.
"Dr. Flores is under surveillance and
may be arrested any moment. If su<h
a radical step is takeji it is quite likely
that a fierce revolution will ensue. The
loyalty of the troops saved Iglesias
iast month, but I doubt whether that
loyalty will stand too many teeta."
JAPAN WANTS
SHARE OF CHINA
No Reason to Deny
Her.
ENGLAND IS ITALY'S BACKER
ON RECORD NOW AGAINST THE
OPEN DOOR.
Small Reason to Hope the Tottering
Old Empire Will Hold
Together Much
' Longer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 14.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent sends
the following: In administration and
diplomatic circles here the formal an
nouncement in the House of Commons
yesterday by the Parliamentary Secre
tary for the Foreign Office that Great
Britain is supporting Italy's demand of
China for the lease of San Mun is con
sidered of great importance to China
and the world at large.
The action of the London Govern
ment is a surprise, not only to admin
istration circles, but to the British Em
bassy as well, and is regarded as highly
significant of the future policy which
Great Britain intends to pursue in the
Far East. While apparently strenu
ously advocating the adoption of the
open door policy, and ostensibly ap
proving the tour of Lord Charles
Beresford in the interest and support of
that policy, the British Government
now urges China to give Italy a port
and sphere of influence which she will
control as absolutely as Great Britain
does Hongkong, Germany Kiaocnau
and Russia Port Arthur.
It would not be surprising to the offi
cials if Japan, appreciating the neces
sity of protecting her interests, will now
endeavor to seize a port with a sphere
of influence. Japan objects to the
granting of the Italian demand, though
she did not so express herself when ln
i formed by Italy of her intention, and
! officials point out that to be consistent
i Great Britain could have no- opposition
to th? leasing by the Tokio Government
of a Chinese port.
Altogether the authorities regard the
outlook for China as very black in
deed, but as they contend that Ameri
can interest.^ are not endangered, it is
not proposed to take any action.
ITALY BACKED BY
GREAT BRITAIN
HOME, March I*.â ln the Chamber of
Deputies to-day Admiral Canevaro,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, made a
comprehensive statement regarding
Italy's action in China. He confirmed
the reported recall of Signor Martino,
Italian Minister at Peking, and an
nounced that Italy had obtained the
approval of Great Britain and Japan
before demanding the concession at San
Mun.
Great Britain had required, he said,
that force should not be employed, and
he promised in return to give her
diplomatic support to Italy at the court
of Peking.
Other friendly powers, the Minister
continued, were notified and indicated
their acquiescence.
Admiral Canevaro then covered the
events already known, explaining that
Signor Martino's action had been dis
avowed because his ultimatum con
travened an agreement with England
that only in the event of Sir Claude
Mac Donald (British Minister at Pek
ing) being unable to induce the Tsung
JA Yamen to take back Signor Mar
tino's first notes should Italy resume
liberty of action in order to obtain re
paration. He 1 , expressed confidence in
the ultimate success of Italy's policy
and reminded the Chamber that Italy's
duty was to refrain from force so far
as possible, since she had gone to China
without any previous provocative inci
dent or violated rights to justify a re
sort of violence that might if
adopted disturb the international equi
librium in the Far East and exercise a
fatal reflex action in Europe, besides
injuring Great Britain, who had proved
herself Italy's cordial friend, and ex
pose to conflict other powers that had
shown themselves the well-wishers of
Italy.
CHINN INDICTED FOR
A COMMON NUISANCE
Grand Jury Charges the Kentuckian
With Attempt to Provoke

A FALL OF
GOLD FROM
THE SKIES
That Is What the Rain of Yes
terday Is to California
Farmers.
Gentle Showers Come Down From the North,
Soak Hill and Valley and Promise
to Continue To-Day.
The welcome rain has come at last. The
prayers of thousands, offered up by the
godJy in the church and, the synagogue,
in the city home and on the country
ranch, have been answered. Rain is
death or life to California. Long it has
held aloof, but at last after weeks of
sickening drought the gentle drops have
come pattering down, and the land is re
joicing. California's parched and aching
lips have been moistened, the little hills
look glad, and the corn is raising its
erstwhile drooping head to heaven. The
soughing of wet branches in the forest
ia a voice of thanksgiving to Almighty
for the blessing of rain.
To the farmer the showers of rain
are as showers of gold. There is a song
of rejoicing on the hillside and in the val
ley The Te Deum Laudamus echoes
from hill to hill, and the lean and hungry
cattle raise their heads and in their
dumb way sound a glad amen.
The farmer has opened the clock, taken
out that awful document marked "mort
gage," and looked at it with a grin of
satisfaction which means "I can see your
finishâ gold Is falling from the skies."
And the farmer is not the only inter
ested party. There is not a merchant or
mechanic within the limits of the State
who does not view the weather indications
from the same standpoint. To the one it
means business; to the other employ
ment, a full purse and a happy heart!
The cold man of the world has a genial
look on his face to-day, and the toiler of
the fields and shop can see the clothes
and food needed for wife and little ones
coming with the drops of rainâ a gift
from heaven.
The rain began to fall in this city at
4 o'clock yesterday morning, traveling
south from Puget Sound. Forecaster Will-
F nn expects it to continue all uay to-day
with possibly Increasing vigor.
The fall has been general throughout
the interior of the State as far south as
Fresno, but along the coast line the edge
of the storm has been a little ragged, and
there has been no fall as yet at San Luis
Obispo. It Is expected that by to-night
the entire State will have received a
drenching.
In this city the precipitation was very
light, as only .21 of an inch -was regis
tered for the twelve nours between 5
o'clock yesterday morning and 5 o'clock
in the evening.
Through the Sacramento v alloy it has
averaged from thr-e to five tenths of an
inch and on Mount Tamalpais over an
inch has fallen. In the higher altitudes
snow has been quite plentiful, and this
is good news to the miners. Taking it
altogether the rain has come just in time
to save millions of dollars to the State
and prevent much suffering.
WEEPING SKIES END
THE DROUGHT PERIOD
Showers Fall Throughout the Central
and Northern Portions of
California.
SALINAS, March 14.â The clouds -which have
been hovering over this vicinity for the past
several days, threatening: rain, have at last
caused a downpour in several sections of the
county, but In this immediate district the
precipitation so far has been very light. At
1 o'clock this afternoon it commenced driz
zling and kept it up until this evening, when
the downpour was heavier. Late to-night it
is not raining, but Is very threatening. The
wind is from the southeast and the barometer
is falling:. In other sections of the county,
however, the rainfall has been a peat benefit.
At 10 o'clock to-night it rained at Bradley, in
the extreme southern end of the county, but
did not continue long. â  Reports from Chuaiar.
Gonzales. San Ardo and San Lucas show light
showers, but Castroville, Pajaro and other sec
tions of the county have received almost an
Inch of rain. The crops in all parts of the
county are not suffering yet, and it is said
that even if rain does not come for ten days
the ranchers will raise, hay in this valley. _
FRESNO. March 14.â The barometer took a
sudden tumble here to-night, which is regarded
as an indication that rain will fall in abund
ance before morning. The sky is clouded and
there is every indication of a heavy down
pour The clouds began to gather this morning
and shortly after 1 o'clock a mist began to fall.
It continued at intervals during the afternoon,
but no heavy shower occurred. The rain.
Blight as it was. has had the effect of inspir
ing hope in the hearts of the farmers and all
are confident that sufficient rain will yet fall
to insure good crops. A heavy rain at this
time would do much toward saving the wheat
crop of the county, though it is thought that
much of the grain on the west side is already
too far gone to be materially benefited. A se
vere frost was announced for this morning,
but It did not materialize. It was thought that
the frost of a few days ago would injure the
fruit crop, but such did not prove to be the
case The buds which were injured were mostly
early and superfluous ones, except in the case
! of apricots and peaches, where some little dam
age was sustained. 14.â The local weather
SAN DIEGO March 14.â The local weather
office forecasts rain for to-morrow, but at 10
o'clock to-night there were no signs of the
approaching' storm, the sky being, very clear.
Grain farmers agree that the rain must come
very soon or crops will be a failure. Fruit
trees are not in immediate danger, but hay
and grain are suffering badly from the lack
of rain, which is aggravated by drying winds.
The acreage of grain In this county this year
Is unusually large and the keenest anxiety pre
vails among farmers as to the outcome of the
weather officer's' predictions.
SACRAMENTO, March 14.-Rain has fallen
here steadily- since about 4 clock this morn
ing. There have "been no heavy showers, but
a continuous fall of light rain all through the
day 'and -if is still drizzling to-night with
strong indications of continuing. There has.
been a good stiff wind. all day from. the south
east. The i storm is . a. most welcome .one. as
, the farmers had become anxious over the- fate,
of their grain crops; and where irrigation was
feasible plans were in- progress, to that- end.
However, the grain in this county had not 'be-.
Kunto suffer for rain, though it had not tnada
as good progress as if the season .had. been a
normal one. ..This rain will do /a" vast amount
of good and with a few more showers in April
it is safe to say crops in this- section will be
excellent. All fruits are doing well.. There
have been no frosts severe enough to , damage
the young fruit and most varieties will : soon
be beyond the danger point. .""Vil*''" ,
SAN LUIS OBISPO. March 14.â light rain
began falling "here to-night at about-, -9:30
o'clock and promises to develop into a good
shower' before morning. Should the fall be
sufficiently heavy it will mean financial salva
tion for many farmers, stockmen and dairy
men in this section..-' 'â _;â  f " <'.;'â 
STOCKTON, March 14.â The long - expected
rain commenced falling this, mornlnjr before
daylight and continued at intervals' till late
to-night. It was. not heavy, but it came in such
quantities that the thirsty earth absorbed al
most every â¢ drop received. ; The precipitation
was very slight, as the gauge only showed
20 of an inch at 6 o'clock, when there. ap
peared to be at least .405 There "has been .30
this month and 6.82 for the season, against 4.94
last year. San Joaquin County received more
than nny other section in the valley, as .42
fell at Tracy, .40 at Farmlneton and .27 at
Lodt. while reports from all other points show
various amounts between the lowest and high
est figures. Very little water fell at the upper
end of the valley. The wind continues from
the southeast," and light showers pass over the
city at Intervals. The growing grain and feed
will be benefited to a certain extent, but will
need more moisture to produce a crop in all
counties except San Joaquin.
SAN JOSE, March 14.â There was a slight
sprinkle of rain during the early hours of the
! morning, and about 9 o'clock a steady drizzle,
commenced, which kept up during t he greater
part of the day. '"While the necessity for rain
at thin time is fully appreciated, It is said by
many orchardlsts that if the rain should have
been delayed a few weeks longer the crops

THE BUSHES FOR
SECRET SUPPORTERS
Expects to Rally Two Votes to His Standard
To-Day.
THE GRANT MEN GETTING UNEASY
Backers of the San Diegan Fear the Wiles of the Man
From Mexico and Are Working Hard for
Accessions.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 14.â Dan Burns, hav
ing failed in his efforts to bring
about a caucus of Republican legisla
tors, is now resolved to bring out the
brush every secret supporter of his
cause. The Grant men received a hint
to-night that Burns expects to gain
two votes to-morrow. From the begin
ning of the Senatorial contest the
Grant men have been well advised re
garding the inside affairs of the col
onel's camp. The report is credited in
the camp of the San Diego statesman
that Burns has two ataked-out sup
porters who can be brought into the
corralâ two and no more. It Is whis
pered to-night that there two will be
lined up to-morrow.
Last night the touts spread the im
pression that Senators Flint and Row
el] of the Scott camp would join the
Candelarian to-day. The reports to
night regarding accessions to the
Burns column to-morrow do not refer
to any one in the Scott camp.
â¢It is suspected by those who keep
pretty well posted that there is some
motive in the apparent apprehension
of the Grant men. The keen support
ers of Grant are quick to use the Burns
eipnal . i danger to invite those who
dc=ire to avert the calamity to flee to
the protecting wings of the San Diego
statesman. It is true that the mem
ber" of the Legislature shudder at the
thousht of electing Dan Burns, and it
is likewise true that a majority of the
members believe that no Senator would
be better than the choice of either.
The people can stand the vacancy for
two years, but the disgrace of Burns'
election is too much to be endured for
An impartial and well-informed ob
server of the situation made this sum
mary to-night: -'Burns cannot win
because public opinion is pronounced
against him. Grant stands - good
chance of success. He has some as
surances of the Scott vote, and by
fretting Scott's men he may detach a
number of General Barnes' support
ers Should he succeed in making
pome substantial gains, many Repub
lican members who are exceedingly
desirous that a Senator shall be cho
sen would line up for him. He might
then succeed in the face of Burns' op
position. There is one way for Burns
to defeat the election of Grant, but the
â¢colonel's' vanity will not permit him
to adopt that course. Barnes is an
acceptable candidate. If the Burns
supporters would go to the general.
the Scott forces would follow suit.
Then the great desire for the election
of a Senator would attract to Barnes
many of the men who are now voting
for Grant. From the beginning of the
contest Burns has been badly advised.
"He has been governed wholly D y his
own personal vanity and has not given
the Republican party a thought. Now
at the la-- minute he is considering a
suggestion to bring Van R. Paterson
Into the contest. The chance of Pater
son winning out against Grant would
be slender, indeed, whereas Barnes,
who has a loyal and active following
of considerable strength, would capture
rnanv of the Grant men. The chances
â¢ are that the Grant, Barnes and Burns
forces will remain as they are until tne
firW. The â¢ Legislature will adjourn
Line die without electing a Senator.
One of the leading topics to-night is
the proposed adjournment sine d. next
â Saturday evening. The Senate to-day
postponed action on the Be shaw reso
lution of the Assembly until Thursday
The course to be taken then will be
â  shared intermediate events. Should
it be made clear to the Grant people
that their chances of winning the fight
lave vanished they will vote to adjourn
*f.; c dÂ£ if the events of to-morrow
and Thursday noon lead to the belief
that Grant can win his supporters will
resist the motion to close the session
the situation In
cline to the belief that if any candidate
can win at all he can win some time
this week It is regarded, however,
as essential to the public welfare that
every member of the Legislature who
vatue- th* good name of the common
wealth and respects the wishes of the
Tiponle <=hould remain at his post or
SS? until the final adjournment .even
if the session be prolonged until .he
F Â°A U n r V h ffort J rna y y be made to prolong â¢ the
session and exhaust the patience of
numbers who have business affairs at
home demanding personal care. The
Burns plan is to diminish the attend
ance from day to day until the number
required to elect is down somewhere in
â tne forties. The supporters of the
' colonel can stay here without detri
ment to their industrial affairs, as few
nf them h ye any means of support
outside of politics and the small profits
of ofnceholding in the departments of
the San Francisco government. If
â Burns cab wear out the good and true
t^t of the Legislature and compel
[Tern to leave he will quickly seize
every advantage that their absence
Â° V The opinion expressed late to-night is
that the Legislature will not adjourn
until Wednesday of next week. The
' Burns touts, many of them despairing
of the success of their candidate expect
to get something out of proposed race
track legislation. The coyote bill is also
expected to produce some "medicine
for the members who are very sick.
In order therefore, to afford relief to
gamblers and speculators the session
She prolonged until the middle of
next week.

MI NTO, March 14.â The concurrent res
olution setting the time for the adjourn
ment of the Legislature at midnight on
Saturday. March 18, was put over by the
Senate this morning on motion of Strat
lon to Thursday morning. There was no
argument on the postponement. ThÂ©
*m-os jeeopla were too willing, tiie Grant
people wore nearly as willing, and the
Barnes people cared but little either way.
As for the Democrats, it made no differ
ence to them.
A motion to reconsider the vote pass

ure is the one providing- for the appropri
ation of $130,fi00 to make a California ex

Tnder an emergency resolution submit
ted by Prisk the Senate took up the news

on the Assembly file and it is doubtful II
they would have been reached this ses

By message to the Senate this evening
the Governor announced that he had ap

On motion of Senator Leavitt th.-> rules

PROTECTION FOR
THE MAN WHO WORKS
TALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March 14.â The fight in the A?
sembly this afternoon was on the rights
of the man who works against the
usurped privileges and perquisites of that
class of grafters engaged in running so
called employment offices.
The question was on Senator Ashe's
Senate bill 4ST, which provides as fol
lows:
Any employment agent or other person who
shall receive, collect or demand from, or charge
any laborer, employe or other person any fee,
commission, reward or compensation for ob
taining employment for such laborer, employe
or other person, and any employer who shall
receive, collect or demand from or charge or
deduct from the wage* of any laborer, employe
or other person any money or thing to reim
burse said employer for any payment made or
to be made any employment agent or other
person for having obtained the services of or
employment for such laborer, employe or other
person, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
Mr. Ashe's bill explains itself. It says
simply that the practice of San Fran
a employment agencies in passing
out to needy laborers jobs that do not ex
ist solely for the purpose of gathering in
the fee which the laborers must pay must
be stopped. The bill passed- the Senate.
To-day it passed the Assembly, and in
neither house did it mc-t with overstrong
tion.
Assemblyman Lawrence Hoey of San |
Frar.cisco"led the fight in the -bill's favor
when it came up in the Assembly this
afternoon. He said that if the bill passed,
as It should, there would come an end to
AFTER ADJOURNMENT.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 15, 1899.
the robbing and cheating of unfortunate
laborers who were in need of work that
they might support themselves and their
families. He said San Francisco's work
ing people had been held down and
robbed by the employment agencies for
years past, and that it was high time
some relief should come to them.
Assemblyman Charles F. Kenneally
strongly seconded Mr. Hoev, and in the
course of his speech he threw down a
number of the pet schemes pursued by
the agencies in milking their victims
Time and again, he said, his friends and
acquaintances had seen signs placarded in
front of the agencies announcing that
men were wanted on the farms In tne
country or at the mines, and that when
they had paid their fee for the job and
gone to the places advertised they found
no nositions; and that they had been
bunkoed out of the little money they
Others spoke to the question, and only
Valentine opposed it. He offered amend
ments providing that employment agents
should file bonds for the honest conduct
of their business, but his amendments
were voted down and the bill passed.
GENERAL APPROPRIATION
BILL IN THE SENATE
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 14.â The Finance Com
mittee of the Senate finished Its consid
eration of the general appropriation bill
this evening and the measure was imme
diately reported to the Senate. It was
then taken up and before the adjourn
ment of the night session the bill had
been read the second time and the amend
ments had all been fought out. There
was a very short attendance and that
probably helped matters along, for the
speakers had no reason to get beyond
cold facts in their arguments.
The consideration of the bill went along
smoothly until the sections relating to
the agricultural fairs were reached, and
then the same old flght over the fair ap
propriations was brought up.
Smith moved to cut out all that part
of the bill which provided appropriations
for each of the agricultural districts. Cur
tin opposed the amendment and declared
that both parties had been pledged to sup
port the fairs and the Senate could not
consistently deprive them of State aid.
Ashe spoke in the same way. Braunhart
supported the amendment because, he
.said, the fairs were no longer what it
was intended they should be; they should
be exhibits of farm products, he said, but
in reality they had degenerated to mere
horseracing, and horseraclng thÂ« Senator
did not want.
Leavitt wanted the appropriation left in
and Davis followed him with the same
demand. The country people wanted the
fairs kept up, he said, and they expect
ed their representatives to see that they
received proper support. Nutt. Jones,
Luchsmger and Rowell also spoke against
the amendment and then Smith rose to
cay there was not a "ranker swindle in
the world" than these same district fairs.
The fairs are given way to conventions,
he said, and, anyway, if a people Wished
to give a fair the county government act
allowed them to draw on their own
county treasury. "The fairs are a dis
grace to the State," said Smith, "and it
is a shame that the State will allow it
self to be swindled by these institutions."
The amendment came to a vote and was i
lost.
Braunhart raised another row over an
amendment allowing book-making as well
as pool-selling at the State Fair. It was
explained that pool-selling was the old
method of betting and book-making was
now the accepted method, and so should
go into the Dili. The amendment was
adopted.
Then Bulla. raised another fuss by of
fering an amendment striking out that
clause allowing pool-selling and book
making at district fairs. Late as it was,
the Senators fought over the question and
the amendment was finally adopted. This
will drive the festive pool-sellers from all
but the State fair.
The appropriation for the State Agri
cultural Society was cut from 130,000 to
520,000.
The bill was not much mutilated by the
Senators. The allowance for the fcjtock
ton Insane Asylum, was cut from $209,000
to $204,000; the Southern California State
Hospital was cut from $33,000 to JJvS.OOO.
The allowance for the purchase of im
plements and hose and the care and im
provements of the State Capitol grounds
was cut from $15,000 to $10,000. The Code
Commission was allowed $5000 for printing
and sundries. The $183,300 allowed for
salaries for the officers and employes of
the Napa Asylum was raised to $190,400.
The State .Dairy Bureau was allowed
As It now stands, the bill totals as fol
lows: General appropriations, J0.113.72S 16;

it was sent at once to the printer after
the adjournment under an order to rush
it through as fast as possible.
COUNTY GOVERNMENT
BILL IN TROUBLE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 14.â 1t was another hard
morning for the county government bill
in the Senate. Three times it survived
an attack on its existence and finally,
after an hour's talk, it went over again
until to-morrow.
Senator Dickinson opened matters by
making the motion to postpone. Davis
opposed the motion. He said if the Sen
ate wished to consider the mea3ure it
should do so. and if it did not the bill
should be killed right there. It was hold
ing on too long, he said, and he feared
when it came to the final adjournment the
county government act would be put for
ward as an excuse for continuing the ses
STILL NO CHANGE.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SAC
RAMENTO, March 14.â N0 change
marked to-day's Senatorial ballot.
The Democrats settled upon Hon.
H. C. Gesford as their choice and
voted for him to their full
strength.
But one ballot was taken. It
resulted as follows:

BURNS 2(5
GRANT 28
SCOTT 5

sion over into next week. Morehouse
hoped the bill would be considered.
Bulla thought something ought to be
done about the bill, for if it was not to be
considered and was to be allowed to die
or was to be killed summarily there were
a good many of its provisions which
would have to be brought up under ur
gency resolutions. He thought if the bill
was "to be killed it should be by vote not
by being allowed to rest on the file and so
Lay the chairman Of the County Govern
ment Committee open to blame tor not
having properly supported it.
As a result of me talk a motion was ;
made in pursuance of a suggestion from i
Smith that the bill be referred back to tne
committee, with orders to report back a
substitute. Morehouse was willing to in
dorse such a plan, but he gave notice that
he would not spend the same amount of
time upon a substitute that he had upon
the original bill. He said he was willing
to accept such amendments as the Sena
tors wished to submit to the committee,
and he would favorably report upon any
such amendments, but he would not call
the committee together and listen to hour j
after hour of argument after all the com- ;
mittee had gone through. The commit- j
teemen had worked from early to late, i
and the stenographer had had only time I
for meals, and he declared that, contempt |
or no contempt, he would not start again
on a substitute at this late day in the
session.
There was more talk, which finally in
duced Simpson to move to strike out the
enacting clause. This was declared out
of order. Then he moved to postpone In
definitely the consideration of the bill.
and this was capped by Leavitt with a
motion for the previous questionâ the mo
tion to rerefer to the committee. The mo
tion to rerefer was lost. Then Shortridge
wanted to strike out the enacting clause,
but ho was declared out of order. Simp
son's motion was then put and lost by 13
noes to 9 ayes. This brought the vagrant
measure to the consideration of the Sen
ate, and then by motion of Bulla another
day was added to its age. It was put
over until to-morrow, and in the mean
time Senators will submit .such amend
ments to the present act as the needs of
their counties suggest, and these will be
embodied in a substitute to be reported
as soon as possible.
MANY BILLS GET
THROUGH ASSEMBLY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MEMO, March 14.â Assemblyman Bur
nett's brand new county division act
came up in the Assembly this afternoon
on its final passage, but it was headed
off by amendments by De Lancie and sent
back to the printer.
Since UW there has been no law by
which counties could be divided. A bill
passed in that year repealed all laws reg
ulating county division and put an end
to the scandals that had arisen out of
county dissensions.
Burnett's bill provides that when 50 per
cent of the voters of a county enrolled
on the last great register shall make pe
tition, the Supervisors of a. county shall
call an election and decide for or against
county division.
The bill came up on its third reading
this afternoon and De Lancie offered an i
amendment raising the required vote to
60 per c-t-nt and requiring that only tax
payers of the proposed new county should
be eligible to vote. The amendment w;ih
adopted and the bill returned to the
Cutter's Senate bill 320 was

Laird's coyote scalp bill was due on
third reading, but on motion of Valentine

To-day was the busiest day of the

ANOTHER FARCICAL
INVESTIGATION ENDED
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 14.â George Washington
Ficks, manager of the Clunie Opera
house, was this morning 1 acquitted by a
special committee of the Assembly of
having interfered with an officer of that
body while in the discharge of his duty.
Charges were preferred against Ficks
by Assistant Sergeant-at-Arms Dahle,
who, on a call of the House, went to the
Clunie in search of members absent with
out excuse.
Ficks at first obstructed Dahle's en
trance to the theater, and afterward
turned out the lights and threatened to
shoot any one who should turn them up.
The committee decided that the evi
dence of the manager of the company
then playing was necessary, and as he
could not be found. Ficks' statement re
mained unimpeaehed.
The committee this morning recom
mended that he be released, and it is
likely that the House will adopt the sug
gestion.

NO ADJOURNMENT
UNTIL NEXT WEEK
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO. March 14.â There is every
probability that the Legislature will not adjourn Saturday at midnight. This
is made plain by personal expressions from a majority of the members of
the Legislature to-day. The Assembly on Saturday passed a joint resolution
providing for adjournment next .Saturday. The resolution is now before the
Senate, but it will not be taken up for tinal consideration until Thursday.
Those who are in a position to know say that the general appropriation bill
and the county government bill cannot be prepared for passage by the Sen
ate during the "present week, and because of this and for other reasons that
have particular reference to the condition of the Senatorial contest it is gen
erally conceded that adjournment will have to be postponed until Wednesday
or Thursday of next week.
the Santa Fe bill under consideration, and
will neither approve or veto it until he
has heard from parties desiring to present
arguments in the matter. The Traffic
Association and the Merchants' Associa
tion of San Francisco have filed with the
Governor certain objections to the meas
ure. It is contended that the proposed
law will destroy competition and resuit
to the detriment of the public. The Gov
ernor has designated next Friday at 9:30
o'clock as the time that he will hear ar
guments for and against the measure.
The Santa Fe Railroad Company, as well
as thje objecting associations, will be rep
resented by counsel next Friday. E. F.
Preston of San Francisco and C. X.
Sterry of Los Angeles, attorneys of the
railway corporation, were advised by wire
to-night that the Governor would hear
both sides. The objecting associations
were also notified of the hearing.
Mr. Maginnis. who is representing the
interests of the Santa Fe, said to-night
that the objections presented by the
Traffic and Merchants' associations were
based on the original bill. He fancied
that the representatives of these associa
tions had not considered the bill as it
was amended before the final passage.

Maud Lamont, a Young Woman,
Narrowly Escapes Being Killed.
A young' woman giving her name as
Maud Lamont and her residence 2')
Fourth street narrowly escaped being
killed by a Geary street car last evening.
She was crossing the street at Stockton,
when she was struck by the car and
knocked down. Several of the passen
gers, thinking she was fatally injured,
jumped off the car and rushed to her
nee.
As .-he appeared to be seriously hurt
they .summoned the policeman on the

For some unexplained reason the doctor
who is supposed to accompany the am
bulance on emergency calls could not be
found, and Lieutenant Birdsell ordered
one of his men to go with it. The unfor

ed to the Receiving Hospital, where an
examination disclosed that she had es

BAD BEEF WAS
BOUGHT WITHOUT
ANY INSPECTION
Order Went to Chicago Direct
From Eagan to Take the Sec=
ond=Rate Article.
CHICAGO, March 14.â Colonel O. M.
Smith, purchasing agent of the Govern
ment at Chicago since 1895, testified to
day before the Government court of in
quiry that the stores of canned roast
beef bought by him during the Spanish
war were all upon the direct order of
General Eagan, the commissary gen
eral. He also stated that some pur
chases of canned beef were made with
out his knowledge by the commissary
general.
Another day's important witness was
Gustavus F. Swift, of the packing
house of Swift & Co. Good progress
was made by the court to-day, but the
end of the list of witnesses to be ex
amired in Chicago is not yet in sight.
Colonel O. M. Smith, who has been
the purchasing commissary of the Gov
ernment at Chicago since 1895. gave the
most important testimony of the day.
He said he purchased oetween May 1
and July 19, 189S, 2,759,252 pounds of
canned roast beef. The orders for pur
chase came from the commissary gen
eral in every case.
At the request of Colonel Davis the
witness produced copies of orders. He
said they were all rush orders.
The recorder read a large number of
telegrams between General Eagan and
other officers of the subsistence depart
ment at Washington and Colonel Smith
with reference to the purchase of can
ned roast beef last year.
"What inspection were these purchases
gubiected to?" asked Colonel Davis.
"They were only inspected by sample."
"In some cases I see the price of de
liveries on the same day varies one or two
cents a pound. What is the reason for
that?"
"These were not my purchases. They
were made from Washington."
MANY BALLOTS
ARE CAST OUT
Santa Clara Election
Contest Decided.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 14.â Judge Hyland
this morning decided the contest over
the District Attorneyship in favor of
James H. Campbell, who is at present
holding the place. The ballots of Vine
land Precinct, which the court discov
ered had been tampered with during
the recount, were thrown out on ac
count of fraud. This gave Campbell a
majority of 15.
Judge Hyland's decision was a
lengthy one, but clear and to the point.
He denied Campbell's objection to an
amended statement filed by the plain
tiff and also denied defendant's motion
for a nonsuit. Campbell took an ex
ception to these rulings. The court
said there had been many irregularities
in the returns of ballots from the Ninth
Precinct of this city, and that the re
turns were objected to. He said the
ballots were the best evidence, and de
nied motion to throw out the precinct.
A number of ballots from various pre
cincts contained pencil marks, but he
was convinced these were put on by
the election officers in tallying and
should not invalidate the votes.
Thirty-two ballots referred for deci
sion were passed on. Eight were thrown
out. Of the remaining twenty-four
Campbell was given twenty and Her
rington four. This made the vote a tie
and gave each 5563 votes.
The Judge then took up the matter
of fraud that he has discovered in go
ing over the ballots. Campbell, he said,
had practically been counted out right
in court. An entirely different cross
was used from those in the election
booths, and on some of the ballots the
culprit had left the imprint of his
thumb. He was satisfied the ballots
had been tampered with.
Vineland Precinct was taken up.
There five ballots hfld been changed
for Herrington, and Campbell had in
troduced testimony to prove the bal
lots were not so marked in the pre
vious contest. The court threw out this
precinct and ordered that the official
canvass of the precinct be taken. The
official canvass gave Campbell 123 and
Herrington 57. This gave Campbell the
office by a majority of 15.
Campbell asked the court to take fur
ther action and see that those that
practiced fraud were punished. Judge
Hyland thought the District Attorney's
office and the Bar Association should
take up the case. The attention of the
Grand Jury will be called to the fraud.
The contest undoubtedly will be ap
pealed to the Supreme Court. It has
been stubbornly contested. Judge Hy
land's decision meets the views of most
of the people and ho is highly praised
for having made such a thorough In
vestigation and detected fraud perpe
trated on the ballots.
LOS ANGELES TEACHERS
MUST BE VACCINATED
LOS ANGELES, March 14.âNotwith
standing the reassuring reports officially
given regarding the smallpox situation,
the cases so far reported having reached
76 since September last, the School Board
has ordered all teachers to show certifl-
cates of vaccination. This In effect
means that all Los Angeles teachers must
be inoculated with virus if they would
continue as public instructors.
The question of vaccination for teach
er? came up at a meeting of the School
Board. President Davis brought to the
attention of the board the fart that many
of the teachers had. not complied ' with
tho vaccination order. Professor Foshay
wa? requested to "instruct teachers and
Janitors to be inoculated with virus."

MRS. STANFORD IS
AN EXPANSIONIST
Favors Acquisition of
the Philippines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 14.â Before leav
ing New York for Washington Mrs.
Stanford talked glowingly with The
Call correspondent regarding her un-
wavering confidence in the grand future
of California.
"One really has to go away from our
beautiful State," said Mrs. Stanford,
"to learn how highly regarded It is.
We Californians ourselves don't seem
to be half-enough appreciative of the
! great country we have the good fortune
jto live in. During my sojourn in the
effete East â this region of ceaseless
business activity â I have heard Cali
fornia more favorably and more fre
quently discussed than on any previous
visit. Now that the United States has
acquired those rich possessions in the
Pacific we are destined to have a big
trade with the Orient â bigger than any
of us ever contemplated. And this is
going to help us increase our trade with
other foreign countries.
"But the people of California rauÂ«t
not assume for an instant that this
avalanche of trade will sweep toward
them of its own accord. They must
exert themselves and coquette a little
with our foreign friends. Californians
now have a golden opportunity. It re
mains with them to take advantage of
it and make the Golden State the em
pire State of the Pacific, as New York
is the empire State of the Atlantic*.
"I am certainly deeply impressed with
the magnificent future of fair Califor
nia. Ah, what a paradise it is! And
it makes me more and more ambitious

standard never before attained by any
similar institution."

Few Criminal Trials.

of O. W. Forsyth, charged with forgery,

allow the case to go to trial. If he does
it will be the first criminal trial since
August, 1898. There was only one crimi
nal trial during the year 1898. Eight in
formations were filed, but five defendants

Wounded Spaniard Who Was Be

and Was Left in a Sit
ting tosture.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 14.â The Sec
retary of the Navy this afternoon re
ceived the following telegram:
PORTLAND, Or., March 14.â Remains
found in a chair about four miles west
of Santiago, as reported in to-day's pa
pers, not those of Villamel, but of Span
ish seamen. Report follows by mail.
PROCTOR, Assistant Engineer.
The officer from whom this message
was received was an engineer on board
the Gloucester, which was the instru
ment that destroyed the ill-fated Plu
ton, aboard which Admiral Villamel
started from Santiago. He was in
charge of the landing party which went
to the succor of the Spanish sailors who
managed to reach the shore from the
sinking vessel and were being fired
upon by the Cubans. While they were
bringing this particular seaman down
to the shore to take him aboard the
Gloucester the seaman died and his re
mains were allowed to sit in the chair
in which the body had been conveyed.
Department officials believe that Villa
mel's body lies at the bottom of the
sea.
The French Embassy has reported to
the Spanish Government and to the
members of Spanish families all avail
able particulars concerning the officers
and men lost and taken prisoners when
Cervera's fleet was destroyed. The em
bassy officials do not recall that Ad
miral Villamel's name was among those
rescued, although claims have been
made that he was received on board
one of the American auxiliary craft
and made prisoner. At the embassy it
has been understood that the admiral
was among the lost and in view of re
ports that his remains have been found
and identified it is expected a request
will be made by Spain, to have the em
bassy obtain the remains and forward
them to Spain.
PROCTOR'S STATEMENT.
John F. Dunning Assisted the
Wounded Spanish Seaman.
PORTLAND, Or., March 14.âAssist
ant Engineer A. N. Proctor, U. S. N.,
who was in charge of the landing par
ty after the destruction of the Span
ish torpedo-boats Furor and Pluton at
Santiago, was seen this evening and
gave the following statement regard
ing the identity of the body found in
the chair on the beach at Santiago:
"After the sinking of the Furor and
the beaching of the Pluton I landed
on the beach in a cove, three-quarters
of a mile west of where the Pluton
was beached, and made my way along
to the wreck, on the way encountering
a Spanish lieutenant and a seaman,
the latter badly wounded in the right
arm and left side. We assisted the
lieutenant to another cove to the east
ward, where about twenty-five sur
vivors of the Pluton and Furor had
collected. On reaching this cove I sent
the men back for the wounded sailor,
with a chair which had been landed by
John P. Dunning of the Associated
Press, and after waiting some time
for their return, I went up the beach
and found that the men had stopped
at the top of a hill, the sailor having
died just as they reached that point. I
had the chair moved into the shade of
the bushes and hastened to embark
with all the prisoners I could take in
my boat, turning the others over to
Mr. Dunning in the Associated Press
boat. The coat mentioned in the dis
patch was probably one which I took
from the Spanish lieutenant and used
to protect the wounded man's head
from the sun. I have been expecting
since that time to hear of the finding
of the remains, as I dn not believe any
of the other Spaniards were left in
chairs."

FISH HATCHERIES ON
EACH LARGE STREAM
Washingtoo's Legislature Pre
vents the ExtiQCtioQ of
the Salmor).
â  TACOMA, Wash., March 14.â Fish Commissioner Little announces D
# to-day that he would proceed at once with the construction of the ad- 3
Â§ ditional fish hatcheries authorized by the new law passed just before $
88 the Legislature adjourned last week. This law is believed to be the 2*
8 most beneficial and far reaching statute ever passed in relation to coast &
g fishing interests. It permits the establishment of sixteen new hatcher- A
25 ies during the next two years, making twenty altogether. This will 8*
8 place at least one hatchery on each large stream in Western Wash- Â«
ington. vj
gg For eight years past the supply of salmon has been steadily de- Â«
# creasing in the Columbia River and Puget Sound. The net decrease
SS during that time amounts to 30 per cent. This condition alarmed both
8 fishermen and cannerymen, who foresaw a gradual extinction of one of <>
iS the State's most important industries. They urged the Legislature to So
X provide every means possible to protect the fishing industry, and it is b.
& believed this has been done. ' 2
88 By the new system of licensing fishermen and owners of fish nets. *5
8 traps and wheels, the State will obtain a revenue of $40,000 to $45,000 g
& annually with which to equip and maintain new hatcheries. Some aid &
# will be obtained from the National Fish Commission. Fish Commis- ,3
88 sioner Little expresses the belief that the salmon supply can be U
S brought up to the maximum within five years, and thereafter graau- â
Â§ ally increased. He maximum within five years, and thereafter Tacoma g|
ally increased. He will establish experimental stations near Tacoma c.
j* and South Bend for the propagation of Eastern oysters and lobsters. Q
Â» ' Considerable feeling exists among Washington fishermen over the Â«
& fact that Oregon has failed to erect a single hatchery, the burden of
S keeping the Columbia ' River supplied with salmon falling entirely upon g

POLITICAL FEUD
ENDS IN MURDER
Fatal Affray at Urban,
Washington.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 14.â A special dis
patch from Whatcom says full particu
lars reached there to-day regarding the
killing of John Jackson by Joseph
Henry, both of Cottonwood. Island, at
Urban Postofflce yesterday. The mur
der was the result of a feud continuing
over several years and growing out of
politics. About a year ago two horses
belonging to Henry were shot and
Jackson was accused of the act. About
three months ago a fight occurred be
tween Henry and Jackson and the lat
ter'B friend. Henry was brutally kicked
with hobnail shoes. Henry caused
Jackson's arrest, but Jackson's friends
testified too strongly and he was re
leased.
Yesterday morning Henry and Jack
son became engaged in another fight,
in which Henry was badly whipped.
After getting away from Jackson
Henry went to his home, obtained his
revolver and returned In search of
Jackson. When Jackson saw Henry
with the revolver he started to advance
on Henry, saying he would see if Henry
had any nerve. Henry then raised his

(?) Hudyan Remedy Co.â Dear Doctors: Kindly allow me to express my opinion with Â®

X losing flesh and strength without any apparent cause, and the slightest exertion would X
fa make me feel very tired. I was passing large quantities of water, and was informed fa
X by the doctors that it contained a great deal of sugar. I was always thirsty and x
X no '"amount of water or other liquor seemed to sufficiently appease my parched mouth X
Q and throat. My appetite was sometimes ravenous, and at other times entirely lost, V
X and occasionally I would have an attack of indigestion with vomiting. I felt weak X
Â© and sore, and had pains In my limbs. My skin was dry and rough, and my appear- (?)
"â¦" ance was' rather an emaciated one. My disposition was greatly altered, and, instead â¦"
(i) of being kind and gentle to my child rcn, my manner became rather gruff and 0
V* coarse. Though I had no symptoms -of consumption, except from the loss of flesh, a
"*" the doctors continued to treat me for it, with, of course, no results. Finally one T'
Â® physician, through an analysis, discovered that I was suffering from sugar diabetes. (â¢)

pistol, taking careful aim at Jackson.
Jackson attempted to turn around, but
Henry discharged his revolver, the ball
striking Jackson in the left side. The
wound lacerated the lungs and death
ensued within six minutes.
Henry went to Anacortes to surren
der himself to the authorities. The
officers, however, refused to accept his
arrest and at last reports Henry was
still at large. Henry is a half-breed
Indian and is Postmaster at Urban. It
is believed he will be taken Into cus
tody by to-morrow and given a trial,
which probably will result in his ac
quittal. He has usually been little
given to provoking quarrels. Some resi
dents of Cottonwood Island think Jack-
Bon was the aggressor in most of their
fights and that Henry had just cause
to shoot him. Jackson has numerous
friends, however, who are very bitter
over the shooting of their companion in
what they term cold-blood. More fights
between these factions are likely to
occur.
SOUTHERN REFORMERS
STRIKE A SNAG
LOS ANGELES, March 14.-The Police
Commissioners, in their self-imposed task
of reforming matters connected with en
forcing the saloon ordinances, met a snag
during their meeting to-day. They came
face to face, in hearing complaints
against the saloon men arrested last Sun
day for selling liquors, with the proposi
tion whether a restaurant is a place for
selling meals to the hungry or a subter
fuge for selling drinks at hours denied
to ordinary saloons.
The question remains undecided, while
Mayor Eaton and the Police Commission
ers have determined to do some detective
work in person to determine this vexa
tious question.
CHANGE OF CLIMATE
WON'T CUREMNSUMPTION
The Slocum System Is Needed.
A Curative Medicinal Treatment Founded on Modern
Scientific Truths Is More Potent
Than Air Alone.
FREE TREATMENT FOR LUNG WEAKNESS
If those of our readers who reside in
the most highly favored sections of this
country, where the climate is healthy
and invigorating, with a dry and tonic
atmosphere, will look about them, they
will see a greater or less number of
their friends and neighbors dying of
consumption, while many others have
already been carried off by that dread
malady.
These deaths have occurred from
time to time amid the refreshing prai-
rie breezes of summer; in the fair and
mellow days of autumn, and also in
the dry and sunny seasons of a south-
ern winter.
Such deaths amid such favorable
surroundings afford positive and con-
vincing proof that climate alone will
not cure consumption; that neither
pine-laden breezes nor bracing mount-
ain air will restore weak lungs or build
up a constitution that is being under-
mined and broken down by the insid-
ious germs of a fatal disease.
But, on tho other hand, many thou-
sands of testimonials from grateful
people all over this country, who have
been cured by the Dr. Slocum System
of Treatment, and are to-day in the en-
joyment of perfectly restored health
and strength, afford the most convinc-
ing evidence that this treatment, aided
by favorable climatic conditions and
surroundings, is a positive cure for
Consumption, Asthma and all other
chronic diseases of the Throat, Chest
and Lungs.
Therefore, those who go to the
mountains, the seashore or to southern
climates, as well as those who already
reside in such favored localities, should
not fall to take the Dr. Slocum System
of Treatment if they wish to derive the

HE KILLED HIS WIFE
Most Atrocious Story of
Crime in Modern
Times.
Boiled Her Body Until the Flesh
Softened, Then Burned It in
the Kitchen Stove.
CHICAGO, March 14.â August Becker
confessed to-night that he killed hia
â wife with a hatchet in their home, cut
her bod In small pieces, boiled them
in a kettle until they were almost dis
integrated, burned the mass of flesh in
a stove and buried the bones in the
prairie near his house.
In detail as related the crime is more
horrible than that with which Luet
gert was charged, or even the atroci
ties of which H. H. Holmes, the arch
murderer, ever dreamed.
In the belief that Becker did not push
his wife into the lake, as he said in h!s
first confession. Chief Kipley and In
spector Hunt presented to the mur
derer last night the circumstantial evi
dence that had been gathered against
him. For three hours he stood the or
deal. Then he broke down.
He was taken from his cell in Hyde
Park station shortly after 7 o'clock to
Inspector Hunt's private office. Wit
ness after witness appeared, and in his
presence told of circumstances damag
ing to him.
Several times Becker seemed on the
point of breaking down, but he would
rally and assert that he murdered his
wife by rushing her Into the lake at
the foot of Randolph street on the
night of January 25. Even after mak
ing the confession that he killed his
wife In the kitchen of his home, he
maintained that the trip was taken to
the lake on January 15 and the entire
story he told several days ago was cor
rect with the exception that he did not
push his wife Into the lake and that

BEGUN AT DAWSON
Ex-Gold Commissioner
on the Rack.
ACCUSED OF FAVORITISM
CHARGED ALSO WITH HAVING
DEFRAUDED MINERS.
David Evans, a Young Klondiker,
Murders a Woman and Commits
Suicide at the Mining
Metropolis.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BY SAM W. WALL.
DAWSON, Feb. 14 (via Seattle, March
14).â An official investigation of the
acts of the ex-Gold Commissioner,
Thomas Fawcett, has begun before
Commissioner Ogilvie. Fawcett is
charged by E. C. Allen with having
wilfully manipulated his powers as Gold
Commissioner for the benefit of him
self and friends. Fawcett's order in
closing and opening Dominion Creek
bench claims and changing the date
are especially cited. He is charged also
with having been unfair to miners in
accepting recording fees from more
than one person for the same claim and
refusing to return the fee upon appli
cation of the person losing the claim;
also that while the records of his of
fice were closed to the general public
he or his clerks made lists of vacant
ground on the richer creeks which were
supplied to especially favored individ
uals.
No testimony has yet been taken, but

INTERESTS THE PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
WASHINGTON. March 14.â Bids were
to-day opened at the Treasury Depart
ment for the construction of a life saving
â¢taUon Â»t Point Bonlta. Cal. The fol
they went home together that evening.
During the time Becker was being
examined he remained cool and col
lected. Even when the enormity of his
crime was depicted to him in all its
horror he was stolid and indifferent. It
was only when Inspector Hunt brought
Mrs. Augusta Schoutte, sister of the
murdered woman, into the room that
Becker showed any interest in the pro
ceedings.
Mrs. Scheutte, by the advice of Chief
Kipley and Inspector Hunt, began to
plead 'with the murderer to tell what
had become of her sister's body. She
wept and implored him to tell the truth.
When Mrs. Scheutte was led away
Becker sat up straight in his chair and
to the surprise of all blurted out:
"I will tell the truth."
For a moment he said no more.
Everybody in the room leaned forward
to catch the first words of the story of
horror they knew was coming.
"I did not push my wife . into the
lake," Becker said. "I killed her with
a hatchet in the kitchen at home and
then boiled her body to pieces in a big
iron kettle. I am ready to tell all I
know now and I will take you to the
spot where I buried some of the bones
that I could not entirely destroy by
fire."
These words wtp spoken by Becker
with no trace of emotion. A steno
grapher was sent for and the story was
repeated in detail.
In answer to questions by Inspector
Hunt the murderer said: "On the after
noon of January 28 I and my wife were
talking in the kitchen and we began
quarreling. She aggravated me, and I
told her that she was not a good
woman, and that I did not care to live
with her. We both became angry, and
she grabbed a plate which was lying on
the table and threw it at me. I got
lowing proposals were received from Cal
ifornia firms:

Francisco, to complete work 90 days after
acceptance of bid, $10,493: P. J. Brennan,
San Francisco, $11,900; Sinnott & McCann,

San Francisco, $11,783. . A check
should accompany each proposal, in de
fault of which the bid i*Â» ignored. This
was the case with that of John Trotten
of Oakland. The contract will be awarded
I to the Thomson Bridge Company.
The supervising architect of the Treas
-1 ury, Mr. Taylor, Chief Executive Officer
! Kemper and the chiefs of minor divisions
i of the architect's office held a meeting to
night to devise plans by which prelim
inary work toward erection of the new
public buildings may be expedited. Mr.
Kemper said to The Call correspondent
that the larger cities would be taken up
first. It is probable advertisements for
! additions to the Stockton and Los An
geles buildings will be among the last to
be considered. Oakland will be among
the first, and bids probably will be pub
lished within the next few days.
The Navy Department has turned over
to the treasury the Arctic exploring craft
Thetis, formerly an old steam whaler.
She is now lying at the Mare Island yard,
but will be promptly fitted out for a voy
age to the North Pacific to carry on the
reindeer investigation in which the Treas
ury Department has been interested for
several years past. She will proceed to
Hakodate, the most northern point or the
i island of Yesso, where headquarters win
be established. She will inquire closely
Into the conditions surrounding the rein
deer herds of that part of the worldâ the
supply and demand and the rate of re
production and the status of experiments
that have been tried and are now being
| prosecuted on the American side of the
i Pacific. The reports that have come to
I the Treasury Department as to the fail
j ure of the reindeer importation scheme in
' Alaska have been so fragmentary and
contradictory 'that it is desired to round
iup all the information obtainable in a
single official report. The Thetis will be
officered and manned by the revenue ma
rine. The Thetis is one of the old Arctic

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 15, 1899.
mad. I saw a hatchet on the floor
near the stove and I caught it up and
struck her on the head. She fell, and
at first I thought that she was only
stunned. I tried to bring her to, and
then I saw that 1 had killed her. After
I knew what I had done I tried to
think of some plan for getting rid of the
body. I thought the best way would be
to boil it to pieces and then burn what
was left. The quarrel occurred about 3
o'clock in the afternoon, and my wife
lay there on the floor nearly two hours
before I began to- cut her up.
"First I undressed her and burned
all her clothes in the kitchen stove.
Then I took a cleaver and cut her head
off and threw it into a boiler full of hot
water. I boiled the body one piece at
a time and as fast as the meat would
fall from the bones I would take them
and put them into the stove. In this
way I boiled the body all to pieces, and
what was left I took and buried in the
alley near my barn. I told the story
about pushing my wife into the lake
because I did not want Ida (his girl
wife) to know what I had done."
After -Becker had finished his awful \
story Inspector Hunt decided that it
was best to conduct the murderer at |
once to the spot where he had said
the few bones which he had been un
able to burn, were buried. Two car
riages were procured, and at midnight i
Beckfr and the party, consisting of In- j
spector Hunt, Chief Kipley, Captain
Lavin, Detectives Niland and Sheehan
and Mrs Augusta Scheutte started for
Becker's home at &017 Rockwell street.
A drizzling rain was falling and the
night was dark, but the party supplied
themselves with several lanterns and
expected to find the bones after a short
search. In this they were disappoint
ed on account of the difficulty encoun
tered in reaching Becker's home. It is
nearly five miles from the station, over
rough roads. The party reached the
home, but at 2 o'clock this morning
they had not finished the search for
the bones.
Becker had been infatuated with Ida
Sutterlin for some time. He repre
sented himself as worth a little money
and claimed to own property where he
had resided the past four years. The
murdered woman, he said, was his
housekeeper. After much persuasion
and the giving to the Sutterlin girl of
a deed to property he claimed to own.
Becker obtained her consent to a mar
riage, which took place early In Feb
ruary. He took his bride to the homo
that had been the scene of his terrible
crime, and about two weeks later the
gossip of neighbors reached the ears
of the police. An investigation was be
gun, which culminated in to-night's
confession.
The police do not credit Becker's
statement that he killed his wife as
the result of a quarrel. They believe
he deliberately planned and executed
the crime in order to marry the Sut
terlin girl.
FINANCIAL FLURRY
HAS DIED AWAY
Confidence Restored at
San Luis Obispo.
DEPOSITORS ARE REASSURED
BANK SUSPENSIONS WILL COST
THEM NOTHING.
The Two Institutions That Withstood
the Disturbance Are Not in
Banger of Further
Trouble.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, March 14.â A1l
signs of the financial disturbance,
which began here on Friday, disap
peared to-day, except the closed doors
of the two suspended banks. Matters
have resumed their normal appearance
on the street and in financial circles.
No further runs were attempted on
either of the two banks that withstood
the flurry, and there were no indica
tions of further trouble.
Commissioner Barrett concluded the
examination of the Commercial Bank
to-day. Though the showing: is not as
favorable as that of the County Bank,
the depositors are amply protected,
and will receive every dollar they have i
in the institution. The stockholders,
however, will suffer much more heav
ily than. those of the County Bank.
Where the statement of the Bank Com
missioner showed that the capital <^f
the County Bank had been impaired to
the extent of about $66,500, the same
authority indicates that that ,of the
Commercial has been impaired to the
amount of $136,500. The condition of
the bank as ascertained to-day is as
follows:
ASSETS.
Real estate I 41,631 40
Stocks'and bonds.... : 60,375 00
Mortgages 28,993 60
Bills receivable ; â 256.989 34
Overdrafts 13,583 80
Cash â¢ â¢ 3,737 31
Due from banks 12.274 11
Cambria agency 18,627 49

LIABILITIES.
Capital ...* 63.894 63
Deposits 297,449 91
Due banks 66,033 51
Total ;....... 1 7, 178 03
About 20 per cent of the deposits
are due stockholders. In arriving at
the value of the assets the values
shown by the books of the bank were
out by $147,002 53.
It is hot unlikely that a considerable
portion of the amount thus "written
off" may be eventually available, par
ticularly if a saving rain should come,
and the indications are good for heavy
precipitation to-night. Should there
be a heavy rain crops and cattle will
be saved that must otherwise perish.
Hazzard Gragg, the cashier, was ap
pointed to take charge of the bank as
the agent of the Bank Commission, and
. was placed under $10,000 bonds. If
there is no unusual obstacle to the
regular course of proceedings it is like
ly the depositors will get their first
dividend of ten or fifteen per cent with
in sixty days.
Commissioner Barrett and Secretary
Dunsmoor will leave In the morning:
for Templeton and Paso Robles. . At
the former place they will go into the
affairs of the Bank: of Templeton. and
at the latter place will examine' the
; Citizens': Bank. â â â¢â -â  \\ -

Richness of the Gold Fir>d at Al
berni Excites British
Colun)bia.
VICTORIA, March 14.â 1t seems that
the long-expected strike of phenomenal
richness has at last been made beyond
all possibility of doubt in the rapidly
growing mining camp of Alberni, on
tho west coast of Vancouver Island. A
vein of quartz, more valuable than any
thing ever unearthed In the frozen val
leys of the Yukon, has been located in
the vicinity of Alberni, and to-day
great excitement prevails in conse
quence in the mining circles of Vic
toria and the island camps and cities.
The find was made on a claim at the
head of Granite Creek, which belongs
to "Patsy" Clark, the well-known and
proverbially fortunate mining man of
Spokane, whose name is associated very
closely with some of the greatest min
ing properties in British Columbia and
the West. The vein was discovered by
White and Wilson, two old prospectors,
who have for years been wandering
over the rocks of this district. They
sold their find to Mr. Short, the repre
sentative of "Patsy" Clark on Van
couver Island.
The lead on the claim is two feet
wide and is a fine body of peacock ore,
with chunks of gold sticking out glar
ingly in it. How rich it is may be
imagined when it is learned that it ns
says $f>SBO to the ton. Those who have
seen the vein describe it as being al
most "the real stuff itself."
The property was found in the first
place in quite an accidental way. White
and Wilson were sitting down resting,
when one of them carelessly knocked
off a piece of the protruding rock and
was surprised to find the piece covered
with glittering particles of gold. This
property is situated about eight miles
from the mouth of Granite Creek. Mr.
INSURANCE MEN
IN CONVENTION
Underwriters Meet at
Del Monte.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DEL MONTE, March 14.â For the
third time in recent years the Board
of Fire Underwriters of the Pacific is
assembled at this resort to carry on in
the quiet of the country deliberations
which have a vital bearing on the coast
insurance business. This year's con
vention is unusually important for
many reasons, the points of business to
be considered and acted upon having
reference to amendments to the consti
tution and general rules of the organi
zation that have accumulated during
the past year, as well as the institution
of sweeping reforms in its management.
It is loudly whispered that unless such
reforms are made some of the most in
fluential 'members of the organization
will withdraw, an action that will prac
tically break up the association.
The board is composed of the Pacific
Coast managers of all leading fire in
surance companies of Europe and
America, about eighty companies be
ing represented. There is a full
attendance at this convention,
practically every company be
ing represented, and there is promise
of big results from the five or six days'
deliberations, especially in the matter
of rates. The rate question will be one
of the first taken up for consideration,
and the attitude of most of the man
agers indicates that the tendency will
be to reduce rather than to Increase the
present rates.
Nothing in the way of business was
done to-night beyond a meeting of the
executive committee for the formation
of a programme for the coming week,
and a plan for campaign for action on
various questions.
The first business session of the board
opens to-morrow at 9 a. m., and there
will be both afternoon and evening ses
sions daily. It is believed at least a
week will be consumed in disposing of
the large amunt of business on hand.

Clark, from the sample showed him,
concluded to purchase, although the
lodge itself was at the time co covered
with snow that he could not make an
examination of it.
It is a few weeks ago since the prop
erty was purchased from the original
locators, and Mr. Short has since been
superintending the work on the claim.
How well founded his opinion of the
value of the property was, is proved by
the news now received and of which
ample confirmation has been sent from
Alberni to-day.
In conversation with correspondents
at Alberni, Mr. Short said he had al
ready obtained the price paid for the
mine in the first few sacks of ore taken
out. He intends to put a large force
of men at work on the property imme
diately and will have a road built to the
claim, which is eleven miles up Granite
Creek, the trail being about twenty
miles from Alberni. He brought with
him to Alberni sime magnificent speci
mens of rock and is now awaiting the
arrival of his principals.
Alberni is agog over the discovery,
for naturally it means much to the
place, as it will give a fillip to the in
terest in the district, and with the grat
ifying news from Hayes Camp, on the
canal, that a large body of bronite has
been struck in one of the tunnels, the
attention of the mining world will be
directed to the west coast mines. It
would seem certain that this year will
see Alberni develop into a large and
prosperous town. The reports from
(iranite Creek, Hayes Camp and other
localities tend to the belief that gold
and copper ore of exceeding richness
is right at hand.
The merchants of the city also are
elated in consequence of the rich strike,
for it will in all probability result in
building up a large mining community
at and near Alberni, the trade from
which will naturaJly accrue to Victoria.
CUTTERS ORDERED
TO BERING SEA
Patrol to Be Resumed
This Year.
Special Disrateh to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 14.â A "Wash
ington special to the Herald says: Or
ders were issued to-day for the re
sumption of the annual Bering Sea pat
rol for the prevention of pelagic seal
ing, and steps arc being taken for other
important service in Bering Sea and
Alaska.
This patrol was omitted last year be
cause all the available revenue cutters
were in use a.s auxiliary war vessels.
The Rush, Oorwin, Perry and Grant
will be sent north about May 1. and
they will have incidental assistance
from other vessels of the cutter service.
The patrol will be carried on under
the same regulations as in former
years. It is expected the patrol fleet
will go north about May 1. The Bear
will go north about the same time on
her annual cruise through Bering
Straits to. Point Harrow in the Arctir
Ocean. She will look after the whal
ing fleet in those waters, rendering
such assistance as may bf needed by
the vessels. Her commanding officer
will look into any complaints of law
lessness along the coast.
The Bear will carry to Alaska the
compensation voted by Congress to the
natives and missionaries who rendered
important assistance to tho Point Bar
row relief expedition in the winter of
1897-98. Most of this compensation will
be given in thf form of food supplies.
The new Yukon River cutter, the
Nunivak, will start north as early as
possible. In addition to carrying a full
complement of officers and men for the
enforcement of the revenue and navi
gation laws on the Yukon River, she
will take out a representative of the
Fish Commission to make a study of
the fish in the Yukon and neighboring
streams, and representatives of the
geological survey to study the mineral
deposits of the Yukon Valley. She will
remain in the Yukon all winter, frozen
in the ice.

BY the handsome majority of 49 to 9 the As
sembly passed the exposition bill, and, on the
same day, the bill authorizing counties to levy
a tax for exposition purposes. The two measures,
therefore, go to the Senate with strong support, and
there is every reason to believe they will be regarded
in that body with a favor not less than that shown by
the Assembly.
In the meantime the Examiner continues its
croaking opposition and objects to the enterprise on
the ground that the season is bad, business dull and
many persons are out of employment. "The expo
sition is not," it declares, "so urgent as the promoters
imagine, but if the drought continue the necessity for
active relief measures will grow greater every day."
Stated in definite terms, the argument of the Ex
aminer is that the conditions of the times being un
propitious to California, while the Eastern section
oi the country is booming with prosperity, we should
not try to launch a great enterprise and attract capi
tal to the State, but should start soup-kitchens. It
is not activity in commerce and industry we need,
cays the croaker, but activity in the distribution of
doles.
If any answer be needed to this argument against
enterprise undertaken with energy in the face of bad
conditions it is to be found in a letter recently written
by John A. Wakefield, secretary of the Omaha Ex
position Company, to a gentleman in Buffalo, who
with others is engaged in preparing for" the coming
exposition in that city.
Mr. Wakefield states that the panic of 1893 found
Omaha on the crest of a real estate boom and at a
time of great industrial and building activity. Its
effects were blighting and disastrous. To use his
own language: "We went to the bottom of the slide
with great rapidity, and the fall hurt us much. The
people were much discouraged, and the financial
gloom was thick when in the fall of 1895 a small
coterie of gentlemen arranged to project and push
the exposition enterprise."
The Examiner will hardly contend that conditions
in California are worse now than those described in
Omaha in 1895. We may therefore pass at once to
Mr. Wakefield's next statement. The enterprise was
opposed, he says, by many persons who declared the
city and State could not at such a period of depression
afford the money for the undertaking. The pro
moters held on their way, however, and found sup
port among progressive men of all classes. Mr.
Wakefield adds: "As soon as the project was fairly
before the people it seemed to have a reviving in
fluence, and those who had been most discouraged
and discontented as to the outlook for the future be
gan to brace up and carry their heads in the air. They
took hold of their own affairs with renewed courage,
all of which assisted in the restoration of good busi
ness."
Commenting upon the results of the enterprise,
which, be it remembered, was conducted during the
excitement of the war, Mr. Wakefield says: "It is
calculated the large sum of $10,000,000 was left in the
cit3 as the result of the exposition. Business was
never better than at present. The year 1898 was the
largest yet for our merchants and jobbers, and the
present year starts out even better than 1898."
The Examiner says the working people of the city
will derive no employment or profit from the expo
sition, but Mr. Wakefield says that from the begin
ning of the work on the exposition in Omaha to the
day of its opening a large force of men was em
ployed, amounting at times to 2000. The result of
course was beneficial to the city.
It is unnecessary to add anything to these state
ments of the results of the experience of Omaha.
Every intelligent man can make for himself the ap
plication to the problem before us. It is to be noted
that at the end of its croak of yesterday the Examiner
hinted that it expects to "share in the division of ad
vertising." Is that what it is waiting for?
One wife-beater has just received a sentence of six
months in the County Jail, and another has been
bound over to the Superior Court. The second brute
ought to receive at least double the amount of the
first brute, and a whipping-post would be too. good
for either of them.
The shanghaied sailor who brings suit for dam
ages ought to receive more than he asks, provided he
can prove his case. Shanghaiing is a malign form of
slavery, and the American citizen who will quietly
submit to it is not fit to be alive.
Chaw Casey constitutes a striking instance of the
guilty but not proven variety. And we might go so
iar as to counsel him not to do it again.

STANDING BY THEIR GUNS.
THE majority still rules at Sacramento. It has
the first and last say upon the question of a Sen
atorial caucus. If the party interests require the
instrumentality of a caucus it is for the majority to
so decide. From the beginning it has decided that
those interests do not require a caucus. From time
to time a recalcitrant minority has attacked the ma
jority on this issue, but has failed to shake it. The
majority, to which alone the interests of the party are
committed, has guarded them and will do so, we be
lieve, to the end of the session. The various candi
dates supported by the majority have offered repeat
edly to retire and leave to the Legislature a clear field
for the majority to occupy and act upon. Only the
one minority candidate, Burns, has refused, and by
standing in the way has compelled the majority to
still stand guard.
Surely the majority and the people should be im
pressed by the spectacle. The Burns campaign has
rÂ»een run on winks and nods and signs, grips and
passwords, all intended to imply a reserve strength,
the appearance of which has been confidently pre
dicted a score of times. As the contest has aged and
one after another these predictions have failed the
bluff has degenerated into a joke. As far as can be
seen now, it is the intention of Burns to prevent a
final adjournment and wait until the pressure of their
personal concerns will cause enough members to go
home to reduce the number needed to elect
down to his size. This is the last desperate resort of
the minority candidate, whose tactics have annoyed
the majority, against which it has been in rebellion.
The party and the people are watching this scheme as
they have the others that preceded it and failed in
their turn, as this will fail and follow them to the
limbo of marplots which have distinguished the
Burns candidacy and its methods.
Good party men are aware that if no election take
place the interests of the party and country will not
be endangered, because, even with Delaware, Penn
sylvania and California i leaving their three seats va
cant, there is left a Republican majority of twenty in
the United States Senate. Good party men wish that
that majority in the Senate, the largest for years,
shall be maintained, and they know this can be done
only by such nurture and admonition of the party in
its highest purposes as will retain for it the esteem
and confidence of the country, now so heartily mani
fested and freely given. This cannot be done by
showing mere wantonness in electing Senators who
represent none of the best motives and highest pur
poses of the party. Using its power to elect- a few
Senators like Burns and Addicks is the short rqad to
a loss of that power by its vicious abuse. Every Re
publican in California who is so from principle
knows, feels and says that the election of Burns
means future defeat of the party, here and the sap
ping of its strength everywhere. For that reason
they expect every man to stand by his duty and his
guns and defeat every scheme of the turbulent mi
nority which is behind Burns. As his candidacy if
openly announced last fall would have defeated the
party last November, so his election now will defeat
it next year. This no one doubts nor denies. No
one doubts that his candidacy was secretly intended
and planned for long before the last election. It was
among the set purposes of a few men who have no
interest in the party except to gather the spoils of its
victories, and who care nothing for the advancement
of its principles. These men cherished their plans in
secret, while those who strive for party success for
the general welfare were making pledges and prom
ises to the people inconsistent with the waste of its
power and triumph in the election of Burns. These
men are justly indignant at the cold-blooded proposi
tion to stamp them as liars and agents of false prom
ises and pledges made to be broken. It is well for
the party that its majority in the Legislature has so
far stood for the redemption of these public pledges
and has repudiated the secret plots of Burns and his
Junta,
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE BANKS
AGAIN.
r "l "*HE necessity for a Federal Senator, if one can
be elected who will represent the intelligence
* and the respectability of the State, is urgent.
But there are also some matters of practical legisla
tion, of more importance to farmers and business
men than to politicians, that ought not to be neg
lected in the closing days of the session. We re
ferred yesterday to . Senate bill No. 678, in relation
to the Bank Commission, which has been amended
under influences evidently political or personal, and
suggested that it be restored to its original text and
passed. The recent suspensions of banks in Santa
Clara and San Luis Obispo counties have made it
obligatory upon the Legislature to pay some instant
attention to the protection of depositors who repre
sent earnings and savings. The County Bank of San
Luis Obispo, as we clearly proved, on account of the
disproportion between its indebtedness and its cash
and convertible securities, in 1895 was badly man
aged, by August 31, 1898, was positively unsafe, and
should have been stopped or at least severely dis
ciplined by the Bank Commission, and by the begin
ning of this year had been permitted to drift into a
condition that rendered its suspension almost in
evitable. The statement of its assets and its liabilities,
completed on Monday last under the direction of
Bank Commissioner Barrett, and which appeared in
yesterday's issue of The Call, not only confirmed our
previous comments, but shows transactions within
niro weeks that demand the closest investigation and
clinch the argument for immediate legislative action.
On January 1, 1899, the bank owed its depositors
$362,214, but on March 13, 1899, this indebtedness
had been reduced to $284,344, showing payments or
withdrawals to the amount of $77,870. It will be in
teresting to ascertain how this sum was obtained and
among whom it was distributed, with special refer
ence to the directors and stockholders. Between the
two dates mentioned the cash balance had decreased
from $12,777 to $6762, or by $6015, while the in
debtedness to other banks, presumptively based upon
the best available securities the County Bank could
furnish, had increased from $87,260 to $149,893. This
addition of $62,633 to the borrowed money on which
the bank to a large extent apparently conducted its
business was effected within nine weeks, and, together
with the cash withdrawn, saved some depositors, who
were "either extremely lucky or singularly favored, to
the detriment of others to whom $284,344 is now due
and unpaid.
Senate bill "No. 678 as it originally stood without
any additional expense to the State would at least
supply a temporary check to this reckless method of
dealing with the money of the people collected into
banks and would serve to bridge over the period
till the next legislative session, when it is to be hoped
a thoroughly digested and effective substitute for the
existing faulty system may be devised and enacted.
It is quite practicable for the amendments proposed
in this bill to become law within three or four days,
ai?d tflc urgency of the situation demands rapidity of
movement. It might be a useful addition to these
amendments to hold the Bank Commissioners to a

certain extent responsible for their own acts, and to
this end to provide that if any bank prove to be insol
vent within six months after it has been examined and
pronounced sound, the commissioner or the com
missioners participating in the report shall be sus
pended, and, unless justified through an investigation
by the Governor, summarily removed. This could be
easily accomplished by an addition to section 6 of
the act establishing the Bank Commission. Section
S should undoubtedly be changed, if nothing more be
done, by requiring notice of every assignment and
hypothecation made by a bank, including a certified
copy of the instrument itself, to be given within
twenty-four hours to the Bank Commissioners. The
statute requiring semi-annual statements to be pub
lished should also be re-enacted.
There is no time to be lost unless a plain legisla
tive duty is thrust aside and the welfare of the people
disregarded.
PRIMARY ELECTION REFORM.
' | 'HE purpose of the new primary election law,
we take it, is not so much to introduce electoral
* reform with a rush as to strengthen the organiza
tions of political parties. While it has been boomed
by its promoters on reform grounds, the more in
telligent of them know that electoral reform must
proceed first from the people; in other words, that an
honest, virtuous, upright people need no laws to main
tain the purity of the ballot. Among such a people
square elections must be as common as pure air and
undefiled sunshine.
Just exactly how the new primary law is going to
work, however, can scarcely be foretold. It provides
that political parties having complete organizations
shall elect their delegates to nominating conventions
under the forms of law, and it punishes severely every
politician who attempts to subvert these laws for the
purpose of dominating conventions or controlling
delegations. It sends to the rear all "committees,"
"side shows" and rump conventions, which in the
past have afflicted city and State by parading thei
virtues under divers high-sounding designations.
Doubtless sweeping this rotten political timber out
of the way will be a good thing. We know of no in
stance in which the candidates of any of these "par
ties" have been elected, and there is no case on record
where they have ever aided the cause of reform. They
are usually the outgrowth of office-seeking and sore
headism, and while their influence has sometimes
helped to curb the arrogance of the bosses, as a rule
they have worked to defeat good candidates rather
than to weed out the bad ones. .
When the Australian system of voting came in we
entered upon a season of ballot independence, which
has almost destroyed the regular political organiza
tions. The influence of that system has not only
disintegrated parties, but it has loosened party lines
among all classes of politicians. It has made bolting
a virtue and has given rise to all sorts of party in-
subordination. The new primary law gives the pen
dulum a swing in the opposite direction. If it shall
turn out to be a practical statute it will be possible
under it to build up our political organizations once
more and make them represent something more than
the wishes of an inconsequential faction or the aspira
tions of a political boss. Citizens who desire to re
form the Government will be compelled to make their
fights at the primary ballot boxes. Politicians who
want offices will have to organize their delegations
and trade themselves into the nomination in regular
conventions, and political bosses who hope to rule
under party labels will have to possess brains and
popularity.
We shall observe the operation of this law with
great interest. Undoubtedly it contains the germ of
an important political change, and if our people do
not get disgusted with it before it has developed
electoral reform it may prove to be the solution of
the entire political problem. Honest government
usually proceeds from the active civism of a virtuous
people. If the new primary election law can arouse
and maintain that sentiment among-our people it will
prove a success. We have plenty of virtue but very
little active civism.
NOT long ago Baldwin made a threat that he
would cover the site of his late lamented
tinder-box with a lot of single-story rookeries,
lie intended to use the walls now standing to carry
out this purpose.
That the fulfillment of the threat would have been
a blow to the material interests of the city there can
be no question, and that the Supervisors, who seem
bent upon serving the public, and are thus a surprise
and a delight, should have overturned the Baldwin
scheme is a thing for citizens to congratulate them
selves about.
The walls of the old Baldwin Hotel must come
down. Such is the official decree, and we hope there
will be no delay in carrying it out. They stand to
day a blot and a menace. The fence surrounding
them is an exhibition of Baldwin nerve. Calmly,
resolutely, without the slightest regard for the rights
of others, Baldwin had the fence erected, and then
went away so far that he could not see it. He
utilized the space needed for pavements, shut of!
access to the places of business of his neighbors, and
never so much as said "By your leave."
San Francisco would like to see on the corner a
creditable strycture. The location is one demanding
this. Baldwin's plan of spoiling the site and damag
ing all property in the neighborhood was as generous
as his practical closing of the thoroughfare on one
side of his property. He rose above all authority for
a time, but in turn the authority rose and reached
him.
There should be no delay in leveling the walls.
They are a constant danger, a nuisance and a detri
ment. While intact they were never fit to stand,
and now, bereft of all support, the only reason they
do not fall on the head of the passer-by is the good
ness of Providence.
Jake Steppacher as Registrar of Voters would bring
to the office experience, a love for Burns, an adora
tion for McLaughlin, a pleasing and modest person
ality, and a wart. There is no tendency to speak
lightly of the wart. It surmounts Jake's dome of
thought and is supposed to be a receptacle for brain
matter that could not find room inside.
Frank Nickel has been arrested for shooting at his
sister with blank cartridges. Frank made a mistake.
If he expected to acquire popular sympathy his game
was to use genuine cartridges of large caliber. Then
he could have pleaded insanity, and all would have
been well with him.
Corrigan is said to feel blue, but perhaps by beat
ing a ninety-pound reporter, his favorite amuse
ment, he might restore his equanimity of mind. The
trouble is that in San Francisco reporters average
above this figure.
Evidently the bankers of San Luis Obispo got
tired of waiting for the end of the drought.

GENERAL CHIPMAN'S REMARKS
ABOUT THÂ±l FUTUBii.
His Report Read at the Annual Meet
ing of the State Board of Trade
Contains Many Interesting
Statistics.
The annual meeting of the State Board
of Trade was held In the Ferry building
yesterday afternoon, with General N. P.
Chipman presiding and J. S. Emery,
Cralgie Sharp, Mrs. Elizabeth Shields, C.
If. Wooster, W. H. Mills, Colonel J. P.
Irish, B. N. Rowley, George T. Trow
bridge, N. W. Spaulding, W. Frank Pierce
and E. W. Maslln present.
Secretary Filcher* read a dispatch ad
dressed by the managers of the Pan-
American Exposition to the State Board
of Trade, in which California is invited to
make an exhibit. Mr. Mills advocated
making the exhibit, and said the Board
of Trade could do more with $10,000 in
making the exhibit a success than the
State could with $100,000. Secretary Fil
cher was instructed to visit Sacramento
and endeavor to obtain from the Legis
lature an appropriation of $10,000 neces
sary to make the exhibit.
A protest from sixteen residents of San
Antonio Valley and the vicinity of Lock
wood was presented to the board. In
substance it refuted the report of E. "W.
Maslln concerning the distressing condi
tion of the valley, with the exception of
such part of it as referred to the rainfall.
These citizens asked that a practical
farmer and a reliable person be ap
pointed to examine thoroughly into tne
conditions and products of the valley,
and make a truthful report.
Mr. Maslin reaffirmed the report he had
made. He admitted that in his investiga
tion he had found tho soil rich but that
it was of such a character that unless
there were a heavy rainfall disastrous
seasons resulted. Mr. Mills also cited
opinions of an expert who had investi
gated the locality and found the soil of
such a character that it was not bene
fited by cultivation. The board deemed
no injustice had been done the residents
of the locality, but it was necessary that
the truth about the condition of this un
fortunate district should be made public,
in order to relieve the remainder of the
State from any bad reputation that might
consequently result.
A letter was received from the
Fresno Chamber of Commerce inquiring
as to whether the board intended mak
ing an exhibit at the coming Philadelphia
Exposition. The letter was laid on the

brandy and vegetables for the year
1898, together with statistical tables
showing other productions, was given the
closest attention by the board. The sta
tistical tables submitted were exclusive
of the home consumption.
One of the most significant statements
made by General Chipman was his ref
erence to California's future. He said:
"I may as well say here as elsewhere
what would be unpardonable to omit
that the Spanish-American war has
opened great and unexpected possibilities
if not actualities for California. Wise
men not Californiansâ and some wise
men who are Californiansâ foreeee and
have placed themselves on record as be
lieving that the most important theater
of commercial activity on the globe is
soon to be in the countries washed by the
Pacific Ocean. It is the belief also of
these wise men that the city of San
Francisco and the State of California of
all American cities and States are to be
the most benefited by the momentous
turn in the wheel of fortune which the
United States has recently given. I dis
claim having the wisdom of these seers,
but I beg to add my humble concurrence
in these forecasts of the future for our
beloved State."
A committee of ladles from the Cali
fornia Art Club, consisting of Mrs Mills,
Mrs Moore and others, appeared before
the board and stated that it was the pur
pose of the club to hold in this city early
in May a State Industrial Fair for the
purpose of advancing native industrial
arts of the State and to encourage poor
artists. They asked assistance from the
board, and received an appropriation or
$"50 and General Chipman was appointed
a committee to co-operate with the ladies
and to render them all the assistance ii\
his power. Tne members of the board are
heartily in acdord with the California Art
Club and the practical work It is about
to undertake. â¢
Mr. Maslin strongly advocated the ne
cessity of the board endeavoring to im
press upon Governor Gage the great im
portance of retaining as Horticultural
Quarantine Officer Alexander Craw. A
new bill is now pending before the Legis
lature which has in view the extension
of the power of this officer. The Governor
has the power of appointment, it being
the condition upon which he agreed to
Â£ign the bill. Tho board will use its in
fluence to get the Governor to continue
Mr. Craw in office.
All of the old officers were re-elected,
and W. Frank Pierce was ejected second
vice president in the place of C. F. Mont

BOY HORSETHIEF CAUGHT.
Leslie G. Beckwith Must Answer to
Charges in Oakland and Salinas.
Leslie G. Beckwith is only 17 years of
age. but he is reported to be a clever
horsethief, and will have to answer to
several charges of that nature before he
is many days older. Last Friday he hired
a horse and buggy from Hermann Broth
ers, 607 East Eleventh street, East Oak
land. On Sunday evening he drove to the
livery stables of J. B. Schroyer, 1523
Howard street, and said he had come
from San Jose and would return for the
ri~ in a few minutes, as he was negotiat
ing with a man to buy the horse. He took
the horse to Sullivan & Doyle s stables
327 Sixth street, and offered to sell it for
$10 Then he came down to $5.
He told Doyle that he had had the horse
for three years and came with it from
Kings City. Doyle's suspicions were
aroused and he called in Policeman
Cooney. who placed Beckwith under ar
rest and locked him up in the "tanks."
lie gave the name of Charles Johnson.
Detective Dillon was put on the case,
and he closely questioned Beckwith, who
told him innumerable lies. He admitted
that he was known in Salinas City, and a
letter of inquiry was sent to Sheriff Far
lev there. Meantime the police here had
be'en notified of the disappearance of Her
mann Brothers' rig, and yesterday George
Hermann came across the bay and identi
fied his property. Beckwith was booked
for grand larceny and was sent to Oak
land in charge of an officer.
Word was also received from Sheriff
Farley yesterday that Beckwith was a
well-known horsethief and he was wanted
for stealing two horses there.

The hearing of some new testimony and
the cross and redirect examination of pre

case brought the spicy hearing to a close
in Judge Mogan's court yesterday after

B. K. Collier, attorney for the prosecu

fact that threats had been made by the
defendant's father against the life of At

noon both defendant and her sister, Miss
Lord, had followed Nagle and his a " or "

Insulting and tantalizing remarks. The
court counseled that the necessary legal
steps be taken in the matter, adding that

asking of the Judge that the testimony of
Mrs. Rodgers. in which she stated that
Nagle Sr. was "fearful," be stricken from
the court records. "There is no question
as to the integrity of Mr. Nagie Sr. or to
his honorable standing as an attorney,
! said his Honor, "and I therefore ask
i that the testimony bearing on this point
be omitted from the official report."
Counsel for defendant offered no objec

During the afternoon Mrs. Rodgers
Mrs Lord and Mr. Nagle were recalled
to the stand. Mrs. Rodgers added noth

A SUSPICIOUS
FIRE IS BEING
INVESTIGATED
Cottage and Contents
Destroyed.
OCCUPANTS AT THE THEATER
WHEN THEY BETUBNED THE
PLACE WAS IN FLAMES.
Suspicion Lies in the Fact That There
Was No One in the House
for Nearly Five v
Hours.
Fire Marshal Towe is investigating a
suspicious fire that occurred at 350 Twen
ty-fourth avenue, near Point Lobos road,
early yesterday morning, resulting in the
total destruction of the building and con
tents. The house was owned by Mrs.
Henry Vorrath and was occupied by
Michael O'Doherty, a motorman.on the
Sutro electric road.
The suspicious circumstance lies in the
fact that no one -was in the house from
7:30 o'clock Monday night, when O'Doher
ty and his wife left it to go to the Al
cazar, till they returned a few minutes
after midnight. When they left there
was nothing that would lead to the sup
position that a fire would take place.
According to O'Doherty's statement
made to the Fire Marshal and Sergeant
Harper shortly after the fire, when he
returned to the house and opened the
front door he was met with a volume of
smoke, which drove him out. An alarm
was turned in, but before the firemen
reached the scene the place was in ruins.
O'Doherty said that he and his wife
went to the Alcazar and had seats down
stairs. When asked if he had any checks
for the seats, he produced a pass check
and in explanation said he left the thea
ter before the close of the play, taking
the check and waited outside for his wife.
He could not remember the name of the
play, but several friends saw him there.
When pressed to name them he said he
could not remember their names. His
furniture and personal effects were in
sured for $600, but he placed their value
at $1000, as his wife, who was in good cir
cumstances at one time, had a lot ol
valuable jewelry. .. ,
O'Doherty's wife was then questioned
by the Fire Marshal and told the same
story of going to the Alcazar, but she
contradicted her husband by saying they
had seats upstairs. She also could not
remember the name of the play.
The Fire Marshal and police searched
the ruins for two or three hours but could
not find any trace of anything suspicious
Before leaving he told O'Doherty to be at
his office yesterday morning. O Doherty
appeared, but although closely questioned
he adhered to his original story.
The building was a four-roomed frame
cottage and was insured for $iOO.

SCOTT & BOWKE, Chemists, New Ywk.SECOND NIGHT
OF THE OPERA
" Cavalleria " and " Pagliacci "
Given Vivid Interpretation
at the Grand*
It was real opera in Mission street last night To be sure Melba
was not in the cast, nor any other special star, and the crowd was
small as compared with that of the opening night. But nevertheless it
i comfortable, satisfying performance in most respectsâ one that
displayed the ensemble strength and the discipline much better than
did Monday's opening. The play, or rather the opera, was the thing,
and in th<> papular double bill of "Cavalleria Rusticana" and "Pagli
acci" we were given two spirited and almost hltchless performances.
The New York symphony orchestra, which was so cruelly caged un
der the stage the night before, came up out of its shell and played
within sight and Bound of the audience and was the star of the night.
We have heard good symphony orchestras before in San Francisco,
hut never such a band of musicians as this one in an opera organiza
ation. It is a perfectly equipped orchestra, finely balanced, clean and
sure in tone and absolutely plastic under the baton of its leaders. Herr
Fried directed in the â¢Tavalleria" and Signor Seppilli in the "Pagli
acci," and both did strong, urgent work. Peppilli, of course, is the big
ger man of the two, and, naturally, he scored the better impression in
the better opera. But Fried's reading of the Mascagni music was no
tably good; he brought out the color and the profile of the score with
fine emphasis. And if he did not interlard the poor old intermezzo
with any special hysteria, who shall blame him? Anyway, this record
breaking chestnut was duly encored as per tradition in spite of Herr
Fried, and the audience was happy.
The "Cavalleria" came first and introduced Mme. Chalia in the role
of Santuzzu. Chalia is a Cuban, and if there are others like her over
there the American opera-goer's burden will not be a heavy one to bear.
She is a remarkable little artiste, full of fire and ginger. She acts for
all that is in her. strenuously and yet never too much; and her voice
is resonant and expressive to a degree without being what you would
call round or liquid. There is a certain dramatic harshness in it that
comes out very pat to the part of Santuzza. Chalia is really an ideal
Santuzza. She plays and sings the part, uuse-like, without any forced
blandishments, and you feel the crude, poignant identity of the char
acter.
Pandolfini was the Turridu. and in that part succeeded as promi
nently as he failed the night before In "Faust." His voice seemed to
gather color and take on new character in this more lenient role, and
his acting showed study and imagination. The Alfio was Beneaude.
whose acting was nothing short of a revelation; in the quarrel scene
with Turridu it was masterly. The performance of "Cavalleria" was
marked by good chorus work, good stage management and unquestion
able atmosphere.
Chalia and Bensaude were again to the good in "Pagllacci." She was
a vivid, passionate Nedda and he a capital Tonio. I have never heard
the prologue sung with finer humor and feeling than Bensaude put in
it, and I have never known another Nedda to be so completely and
dramatically realized as Chalia's was. Our old Tivoli favorite Mich
elena was called in at the last hour to sing Canio. His voice seemed
vague and out of form, but his acting was as keen and thrilling as
ever. Another change in the cast was the substitution of Suinto Zane
in tw place of De. Vries in the part of Silvio. Mr. Zane, like Michelena,.
happened to be local and handy, and he also acquitted himself quite
honorably.
In "Pagllacci," as in "Cavalleria," the acting was admirable
throughout, and the choruses were remarkably good. The orchestra
under Seppilli played with superb sweep and spirit. Everything' that
is in the score, and more than we had ever heard at other hands, he
brought out. And this, I am sure, was only a taste of what he will do
to-night with the brilliant orchestration of "Boheme."
All mall, the double bill was an enthusiastic go, full of happy sur
prises and * valuable art. Everybody in the house seemed pleased, and
made no bones about showing it. Melba sat in a box and compli
mented her colleagues with liberal applause.

Attempted to Introduce the

The police last night made an inef

calling ha'-ks. now In vogue in the East,

After Monday night's performance hun- :
dreds of hacks were crowded in the nar
row confines of Mission street. People
crowded out of the theater, each man
looking for the hack that brought him .
regard iof th<? convenience of his
neighbor, and the result was general con
fusion and a blockade of the street.
Sergeant Gorman and Corporal Bowlen,
the local Inspectors of hacks, according
ly put their heads together and decided
â¢roduce the Eastern check system.
This system works as follows: When a
party drives up in the hack he is handed
a card with a number printed on it. The
harkman is also handed a card bearing
a similar number and he takes his place
in line. When the play is over the first
man out shows his card, and he is as
signed to the fsrft hack in line, whether

not. The driver has a card U> nhow.

and the police, but it did not work. The
first kick came from the United Carriage
Company and it was followed by an ob
jection from one of the large stablemen.
The citizens, the stablemen generally and
the police were well satisfied with the
plan, but kickers are to be found every
where, and a few kickers spoiled this
scheme. The result naturally was the
usual confusion as soon as the play was
over.
In order to facilitate the working of his
plan Sergeant Gorman presented the fol
lowing circular to Mr. Morosco with tho
request that it be read out between the
acts:
"Owing to the confusion caused by par- j
ties looking for the same carriage that i
brought them to the opera the hack in
spectors have made arrangements with |
the different carriage companies or Pta- 'â 
bles to place their carriages in one con
tinuous line.
"Tickets have been issued to all per- I
sons that will entitle the first to leave I
the theater to take the first carriage or
coupe in line., and would request that the
party taking the carriage leaving the the
ater give his name and the name of the
stable or company that brought him to
the theater to the driver. â 
"Collections will be made by the com
panies or stables bringing the parties to
the theater for the round trip.
"These arrangements are to continue i
during the opera season."
Owing to the objections as before stated j
the order was not put in force, but Ser
geant Gorman hopes to be able to enforce I
it next week.
Special arrangements will be made for
parties having private carriages.
When the order is put in force in this |
city all parties will be expected to drive i
in from Fourth street. The carriages will j
deliver their loads In front of the thea- j
ter. Private carriages will take their i
stand along Third street and hacks will
form in line between Fourth and Fifth
and gradually work their way down. The
first man out having a card will get the
first hack.
TRADE TURNED WESTWARD.
Manager Goodwin's Mission to Wash
ington Beginning to Bear
Fruit.
At a meeting of local merchants held
in the rooms of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association yesterday the re
port of Manager Goodwin of that asso
ciation, who was recently sent to Wash
ington to press the claims of San Fran
cisco as a purchasing and distributing
point for Government supplies, was read
and approved. The results that have
been obtained in this instance and hereto
fore by concerted action of the merchants
in using all legitimate efforts to increase
this class of business in this city prove
conclusively the assertion often made
that when they all pull together for the
common good of San Francisco the re
sult is a substantial benefit.
The report shows that new business was
secured from the. lnterior Department by
an enlargement of the purchases for In
dian agencies and schools on this coast
worth about $50,000 per annum and oppor
tunity secured for local merchants to bid
on classes of supplies for that department
hitherto purchased In the East.
In view of the large Increase in the
naval establishment on the Pacific, argu
m'-nt was made by Mr. Goodwin before
the Navy Department officials that the
Mare Island Navy-yard should be placed
on the same plane as the New York yard
as a purchasing and distributing point
for naval supplies, and while no decision
was obtained on this point the way has
been paved for favorable action in the
near future. Due credit is given in the
report to Senator Perkins and Represen
tatives Loud and Hilborn for their effort*
In behalf of San Francisco.

YOUNG COWBOY IN
THE CITY PRISON
John Dudley, a Precocious Plainsman of 14
Years, Wants to Join AcLmiral Dewey's
Fleet in Order to Win Fame.
JOHN DUDLEY is only 14 years of age,
but since his ninth year he has car
ried a big revolver and led the life of
a free and independent cowboy. He
claims he can ride a broncho with the
best of them and can shoot with the ac
curacy and steadiness of a veteran fron
tiersman. He arrived here about a week
ago on the steamer Santa Rosa from San
Diego and got a free passage by giving
exhibitions of his skill with the revolver
j to Captain Alexander and passengers.
After arriving here he thought he
i would like to join the navy and roamed
around the water front until he could get
; a chance to reach Mare Island. The
i chance did not come and Policemen Boyd
I and Ellis arrested him and sent him to
â  the City Prison yesterday, where he was
1 booked for a public- institution. He takes
i his incarceration with the nonchalance of
BABY GRAY
A VICTIM OF
FOUL PLAY
Autopsy Bears Out
Murder Theory.
STOMACH BURNED BY ACID
CHILD COULD NOT HAVE SWAL-
LOWED THE POISON.
Dr. Zabala Believes the Corrosive
Fluid Was Forced Down the
Child's Throat â Mother
Pleads Innocence.
Two-year-old John Richard Gray did not
; swallow the acid which caused him to die
: in frightful agony Monday morning vol
-1 untarily. At least such is the opin
; ion of Autopsy Physician Zabala,
', who made a post-mortem exam
; ination of the frail little body for the
) purpose of determining the cause of
| death, at the Morgue yesterday afternoon.
Dr. Zabala says he found the child's
! mouth and throat badly burned by the
! fiery fluid and his stomach literally caked
iby the action of the deadly poison. Jn
! view of these facts, the physician de
' clares that in his opinion the acid was
â¢ forced aown the baby's throat.
"If the child had found the bottle con
taining the acid in the yard, as stated by
] his mother," said the doctor, "he could
j hardly have drank a sufficient quantity
j of the stuff to cause death in such a short
time. A taste of the acid would have
! caused him to immediately spit it out
; and very little could have gone down his
throat, certainly not enough to cause nis
death so soon, or to leave such terrible
evidence of its work."
Another point made by Sergeant Duke
and Detective George Graham, who have
been detailed on the case, in support of
their contention that murder ha.s been
committed, is that while there are broad
scars made by the acid on the face of
the dead child, there are no marks on the
chin. This, they claim, proves that the
child's head was forced back and the acid
poured into its mouth, while if he had
drank the poison from the bottle some of
the riuid would naturally have trickled
down on its chin and left its mark plainly
visible.
Owing to the absence from the city of
Coroner Hill the inquest will not be held
until to-morrow morning. In the mean
time Mrs. Minnie Adams is confined be
hind the bars of the City Prison, accused
of murdering her offspring by Wilson
Gray, who admits its paternity and his
former love for the woman. Her 10-year
old brother, HaTrison Tyrrell, whose evi
dence may convict or clear her, occupies
an adjoining cell, and the officers of the
law are scouring the city for additional
| evidence against her.
Mr*. Adams has not yet been formally
i charged with the crime and will not be
until the Coroner's jury has rendered its
verdict. She setms hardly to realize the
enormity of the offense charged against
her. She is not a good woman morally,
but she does not look like a murderess,
I and while her accounts of the events of
j the fatal morning are conflicting it is but
I justice to her to say that the lnacoura
! cies in the statements made by ncr lo
I the police and others since the sad affair
are l->y no means fatal in themselves to
her cause. She talks freely of the case
anl without any appearance of a desire
to hide anything, but while she speaks
in loving terms of the little one, her
words lack tho tender feeling natural to
a mother. She uses the same intonation
when speaking of the man who accuses
her of the unnatural crime. She >ays it
is a piece of sj>ite work on his pa.-t, but
she says so without a trace of resentment
I in her manner and with little ait>.irciit
I concern. She tells the story of her pest
without hesitation or attempting to pal
liate her offenses against morality and
i decency. She is not pretty, yet she .s lar
from being a plain woman, and to an or
dinary observer there is no evidence of
"toughness" in her make-up.
Mrs. Adams says she was married to
John C. Adams, a soldier at the Presidio,
on March 10, IM)3, when she was a girl of
i 18. They kept a rooming-house on Ches
ley street for a while, and John W. Gray,
an ex-soldier, was one of her roomers.
"My husband did not provide for me or
I the children," she said yesterday, "and
when he deserted me and went to Oregon
in 1596 Gray offered to provide for me,
and I accepted his offer. We got along
very well for some time, although he of
ten came home drunk and abused me.
He gave me his wages to save every
week, and the first serious trouble we had
was last July. I then had $165 of his
money, and when he came home drunk
one night and demanded it I refused to
give it to him until he was sober, as I
knew he would spend it. He finally got a
revolver and threatened to kill me. He
got the money and drove me and the
children from the house and wrecked the
furniture. I had him arrested, but he
offered to pay for the things and behave
himself, and I withdrew the complaint.
Several weeks ago some one broke into
the house and stole $60 we had saved,
and Gray accused me of taking it. He
threatened to kill me and drove me away.
I then went to live with my father.
"I did not kill my baby, and I do not
see how they can accuse me of such a
thing. I sent for Mrs. Kenney as soon as
I discovered him in convulsions at the
foot of the back steps, and she said he
had spasms and for me to give him some
whisky, which I did, although I told her
he never had spasms. I found him at a
quarter past 11, and at 25 minutes to 12
Dr Niemeyer came and did everything
he could to save the little fellow, but he
died before noon. I did burn the boy's
waist as it was dirty and burned with
the acid. Perhaps 1 did wrong, but 1
did not know it at the time. I do not
have any fear for my safety, as I have
done nothing for which they can punish
Wilson Gray, the father of the child
and the woman's accuser, is a teamster
and resides at 1147 Harrison street. He
is a dull looking man of about 45 years of
age and according to some accounts is
possessed of a far from pleasant dispo
sition. He baa not. bo the Tyrrells say,
a typical cowboy, but wants the police to
give him a cha"nce to join the navy, as
he feels sure he would soon distinguish
! himself if he got an opportunity to be ;
sent to Manila.
Soon after he arrived here some one i
told him that if he carried his big revol
ver around with him he would be arrest
ed for carrytng a concealed weapon, so '
he gave it "to a sailor friend with the
promise that it would be returned as soon
as he joined the navy. He says he has
traveled all over the United States with- j
out paying any railroad fare and was
never thrown off a train, but always '
| treated kindly by the train hands.
i The boy says his father and mother died
I when he was young and he lived with
his grandmother in Pueblo. Colo., till he i
| was nine years of age, when he started I
out to make a name for himself as a cow-
I boy. He is a precocious youth and the
police are puzzled to know what to do
with him.
done anything for hia child since he part
ed with the mother, and when notified
of the little one's death did not go near
the house until he had fortified his cour
age -and secured a bodyguard of two
friends. The neighbors were notified of.
his arrival on the scene by the volume
of vile and abusive language that issued
from the Tyrrell house. They say Gray
was the author of the racket, and
add that his infrequent visits to the place
were always marked by Bimllar out
bursts.
In fact, the neighbors give the Tyrrells
a good name, and say Mrs. Adams seem
ed to be very fond of the dead child. The
Tyrrell family consists of the father.
John Tyrrell, who is employed at Laurel
Hill Cemetery: George, who is employed
by Camp & Crillon: John. Jr., Louis, Har
rison and Edward, in addition to Mrs.
Adams and her two remaining children.
Tyrrell's former wife is the wife of Cor
nelius Kelly, a contractor, and is at pres
ent residing with her daughter Sophie,
wife of Charles Trumpaur, 24 Chesley
strret.
The boy Harrison, who claims to have
found the bottle containing the acid and
placed in where it is alleged to have be.-n
found by the baby, still sticks to his
story, with variations, which confirm the
officers in their belief that he is not tell
ing the truth. Monday night he said that
when he threw the bottle behind the out
house the metal cover was in place. Yes
terday he said it was lying on the ground
some distance from the bottle. He ad
mits the discrepancy, but claims he was
alraid when he told the first story.
Gray will bury the body of his child as
soon as it is "delivered to him by the
Coroner. __^__________
RELATIVES DESIRE THE
FIRST CALIFORNIA HOME
JULIUS KAHN URGES NO SPEEDY
ACTION.
Meeting Last Evening Is Attended by
Four Hundred and Fifty
Parents and Friends.
The relatives and friends of the boys
composing the First California Regiment,
now at Manila, met last evening at Na
tive Sons' Hall for the purpose of dis
cussing plans which might result in the
speedy return of the soldiers from the
land of the Filipinos. C. W. Moore of the
Hancock School occupied the chair and
A. L. Badt acted as secretary. About 450
eager and anxious relatives were pres
ent.
Two telegrams, dated Washington and
signed by Adjutant General Corbin, stat
ing that the men would be returned as
soon as expedient, and that according to
advices from General Otis they did not
wish to turn homeward until hostilities
ceased, were read by the secretary. Ex
ception was immediately taken to the lat
ter statement and the sentiment of the
meeting was expressed in the following
resolution, which was adopted without a
dissenting voice:
Whereas, telegrams lately published, evi
dently f-manatlDK from the War P- iartment at
Washington. Indicate that a demand for re
enlistment will be made on volunteer regiment 3
now serving !n the Philippines when the time
arrives for their being mustered out; and
Whereas, the War Department claims to have
received authentic information thai the volun
teers themselves request s-uch re-enlistment;
and
Whereas, we, the parents of the volunteer sol
diers composing the Firs=t California Regiment,
know fully the sentiments of every private sol
dior in said regiment to be not only positively
and decidedly against voluntary re-enlistment,
but. on the contrary, eagerly expectant of Im
mediate release from service; therefore be it
Resolved, That the information forwarded
to the War Department of a <lesirÂ« of volun
teers to re-enlist is misleading and incorrect,
as far ac the First California is concerned.
Resolved, That the First California Regiment,
having been exposed from the I'.'ith day of May.
i the present date to continuous and un
remittlnc hardship*, is eminently entttifd, if
not to immediate discharge, at least to an
Immediate return to this country for recupera-
Resolvpd. That a copy of thepe resolutions,
embodying the true sentiment of the parents in
mass meeting assembled and of their sons now
."orving in the First California Regiment, be
trariKmlttpM to the Secretary ot War, R. A.
Alger. and to Adjutant General H. C. Corbin,
wi'h ;t view of enlisting their official action for
the immediate return of the First Regiment,
California United States Volunteer Infantry,
for final discharge.
Congressman Julius Kahn was present
by invitation and addressed the meeting.
He explained that the troops had enlisted
fi>r a period to extend to the end of the
war. and that according to the law of
nations the war had not yet ceased and
would not until the President shall have
signed the peace proclamation. He said
that while he was in Washington he had
interested himsolf in behalf of the boys
with Senator Perkins and had received
assurances that the First California
would be returned as soon as it was pos
sible to withdraw it. He urged that no
action be taken, as the War Department
was exerting itself to accomplish what
was sought.
Captain E. C- Sutliffe, recently dis
charged from Company G, said that he
believed the reports of untold suffering
among the troops to be exaggerated, but
he further took occasion to remark that
when he departed in January the mem
bers of the regiment were anxious to get
home.
DIED OF HIS INJURIES.

PRIED FRUITS IN NEW YORK.
The New York Commercial says:
"There Is an active demand for all varieties
of California dried fruits, with the exception
of raisins, and they are doing better. The
consuming trade has picked up in the past
few days, and. while orders are scarcely ever
for more than carlots, and even orders of
that size are not numerous, the aggregate of
such orders makes a generally good business.
Prices remain firm, with upward tendency, and
practically all dealers speak hopefully of the
prospects. .
'â California prunes are closely concentrated.
Demand appears to be increasing, but the
larger sizes receive the most attention. Some
buyers sufficiently realize the impossibility of
securing a sufficient supply of the larger sizes |
and are buying more freely of mediums. The j
result is a strengthening of the market in
all positions, with indications of advancing
prices on all sizes. On the coast it is re
ported that the spring demand is not being
felt yet. There Is a gradual reduction of
Furplies but, according to some mail advices,
the quantity still available is ample. A few ;
small holders are disposing of odd lots at 3c |
for Santa Claras and 2%c for outside. Large
holders of choice goods refuse to consider any- j
thin? less than 3Â«.;i3"3%c for Santa Claras and ;
2 *<g3c basis for outside. The general situation
is said to be one of waiting.
"Less activity In peaches is reported from j
the coast, but prices remain firm. The buying 1
of a few cars for actual â¢ trade requirements i
was a feature, and even small orders are no- 1
ticeable. On the spot the market retains its
strength, but there are no large sales and
prices are steady at previous range.
"Apricots are steady at previous range of !
prices and reports Indicate that supplies are
very deficient, but just how many cars of '
desirable fruit are now available It is im- '
possible to say. There is a feeling, however, \
that supplies are low In all positions and that
increased demand will unquestionably send
prices up. At the moment domestic .demand is
about all there Is to trade. Exporters cannot ,

â¢'The raisin situation shows little change.
There is a better feeling in the trade, caused

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 14.â The net changes in
Btock prices to-day were irregular, with mostly
losses prevailing. London quotations Induced
a lower range of prices here at the start. Firm
ne?s In the call money market, which ranged
from 3<a4 per cent, was a depressing influence
much of the day, but with its easing off to
3"53% per cent before the close a rally set in
which wiped out earlier losses in some stocks.
Union Pacific, Northern Pacific, Atchison pre-
ferred and Manhattan were under pressure
most of the day and disturbed confidence
among the other railways, which were, weak
on moderate offerings. The weakness In Man
hattan was perhaps attributable to anticipation
of the new Issue of stock. Fear of the pos-
sible failure of desired legislator affected
Third Avenue and Consolidated Gas, while in
connection with the latter there was also talk
of Increased competition. The pronounced
strength of Tobacco, which at one time touched
214 V*. was unaccompanied by any explanatory
news. Sugar tlisplayed considerable firmness
when other points of weakness were appearing
and ended with a small net advance. Chicago
Termlnul, Hocking Coal and Iron, Union Pa
cific and Denver and Gulf were features of
strength. In the afternoon rally the grangers
and standard shares generally were lifted about
a point from their low figures and retained most
of their recovering, leaving them Irregularly
changed for the day. The calling of some loans
liy the- banks for syndicate account prepara
tory to the payment of three-fifths of the Chi
cago and Alton money due to-morrow In con
nection with the recent "deal" was In a large
measure responsible for the strength in <-;tll
money. There was a reflex easing in sterling

THE SECOND RACE.

Jones and Shaen Placed
Under Arrest.
The hot time that is promised -when
! Dewey comes home will be like an equa
! torial calm when compared With the tur
: bulent few hours spent by the race goers
at Ingrleside track yesterday afternoon.
< There was much trouble in the house of
Corrigan, and for the first time in the
: history of California racing, a squad of
stalwart policemen held possession of the
betting ring. The detailed story of the
I trouble appears In another column.
The rainfall left the track in a slushy
! condition, and as the fields were well
â  balanced, bettors and bookmakers alike
regretted the day's doings. " Hard luck
. stories there were In plenty. Many got
: in wrong over the result of the first two
: events, and were positive they could have
beaten the other four. These post-mor
tem specialists may have been right, as
four straight choices headed their fields
past the stand.
Backed from 10 to 5. Ping, ridden by
Ivy Powell, won all the way in the open
' ing mile and a sixteenth event, rim, the
favorite, finished second, six lengths be
: fore Annowan.
Fog obscured all view of the two-year
old scramble. The Convert and Florentia
: coupled had first call in the. betting. The
first named managed to show. Mounte
bank, piloted by the king-pin two-year
old rider, Mike Hennessy, at 4 to 1, led
i Sisquoc over the line nearly two lengths
The seven-furlong selling affair proved
I only a pipe-opener for the favorite, Trux
! illo. Hughey Jones' horse splashed in
several lengths in advance of %V idow I
I Jones, with Cavallo a close third.
The mile selling run went to Sardonic,
I even if she didn't rightfully belong there.
Caspar made a fine front run, only to be
beaten the last part, chiefly through the
i weak effort of Romero, a novice
\ poor sendoff lost the flve-furlong
sprint for Ach, favorite in the hand |
books. The colt made a good run, but
could not quite get up to Good Hope,
i who won by over a length.
Ed Lanigan thought his big horse Rubi
con, allotted 112 pounds, a good thing ior
! the mile handicap, and the chestnut was
a prominent favorite In what betting was
done. Bendoran, carrying 120 pounds and
Spencer, led him from start to finish, win
; ning with something in reserve. The
other starters were beaten off.

Mrs. Amanda' J. Marceau-Fennell se
i cured a divorce from her husband, Gerald j
â¢ M. Fennell. yesterday on the ground of
desertion. Judge Hunt ordered the decree â 
entered after the examination of Mrs. i

i from her husband in tbe courts Of Fresno, j
1 but a decree was denied on the ground of i
i collusion. Fennell, after the conclusion
' of this suit, left for the East, and as he
: made no contest to the action determined
yesterday there was no alternative for
1 the court but to grant the decree.
Elise Hanson has been granted a dl
! vorce from Francis M. Hanson on the
' grounds of failure to provide and cruelty, j
Mary P. Bennett has secured a divorce
from Charles S. Bennett on the ground j
of desertion. Susan Batchelor was grant

a lucky star. It Is all because he invested
la a 25-cent ticket of the "Original Little ;

Cisco that has brought him in the tidy ,
sum of $1250. Yesterday Mr. Geo. G. j
Gauld. representing that company, as ;
well as the "Original Little Honduras

to Mr Miller the sum above mentioned.
Mr Gauld will next visit Carson to de- j
liver to another lucky investor in his
company the sum of $37d0.â Morning
Union, Grass Valley, Cal.
The lucky holder of the capital prize in
Carson City, Nev,, was Mr. Jos. Platt of;
the firm of Jos. Platt & Co., dealers in

REGENTS FAIL
TO SELECT A
NEW PRESIDENT
Kellogg Will Finish
the Year.
No inclination was shown by the re
gents of the University of California at
their meeting yesterday to appoint a suc
cessor to President Kellogg, whose resig
nation takes effect on charter day, the
26th of the present month. The matter
was slightly discussed during; the execu
tive session of the board, but out of def
erence to Governor Gage the settlement
of this important matter was postponed
until after the Legislature adjourns,
when, it is said, the chief executive will
be present to express his views on the
subject.
As the university would be without a
head within a few weeks. President Kel- i
logg was requested to act in his regular '
capacity until the end of the academic '
year, which will close about July 1. Re
gent Arthur Rodgers is at present in the ,
East in search of a suitable educator to
look after the destinies of the big :nstitu
tlon. When he returns he will in all prob
ability bring the solution of the vexing
problem.
Dr. Pardee of Oakland, the newly ap- ',
pointed member of the Board of Regents, i
took his seat at the meeting yesterday
and paid particular attention to the busi
ness of the board.
During the meeting the members
| showed signs of nervousness. It was due
: to the fact that a piece of cardboard five
by twelve inches at the right of the chair- '
! man's seat stared them in the face and ;
| told of the number of meetings attended !
by each member. It was a brilliant idea
of the secretary of the board. Pink I
splurges here and there on the poster
denoted that a special meeting was held
on a certain day. A heavy black dia
mond showed that a member had re- â 
; mained away from a meeting. As the re- â¢â 
; gents are busy men and are frequently :
absent, the card bore a close resemblance
to a checker board. It was thought that
Regent Hellman carried off the prize, he '
having twenty-three diamonds opposite I
his name, but last on the list was James j
A. "Waymire, with five more. Regent I
Reinstein loudly complained of the eight ;
marks charged again tst his name. He
stated that he had attended every meet- !
ing of the regents while he was in the
city, and while on a visit to Europe he
was granted leave of absence. The sec- I
retary was Instructed to examine the rec
ord and make the necessary correction.
As it now stands the record of non-at- ; '
tendance for the twenty-four regular and
the twelve special meetings held during
the past two years is as follows:
Regents Kellogg 0, Budd 7, Foote 7, Hal- i
lidle 1, Hellraan 23. Houghton 5, Martin 6, i
Miller 15, Phelan 8, Pheips 2, Reinsteln 8,
Rowell 22, Rodgers 18, Slack 14, "Wallace
10 and Waymire 28.
Despite his age. President Kellogg never '
missed an attendance during that pro- '
longed period. This fact was favorably i
commented on by a number of the re
pents.
Before the board went into executive
session a report submitted by Mr. De- /
nlcke on the condition of the Flood es- â¢
tate at Menlo Park was read. It was to !
the effect that choice plants and shrubs
have been sadly neglected during .the past
three years, and that the beautiful
grounds should either be preserved or al- ;
lowed to deteriorate into farming land.
When Miss Flood turned over the mag
nificent property to the university she
also gave four-fifths of her stock In the
Bear Valley Water Company for its
maintenance. John J. Heir, auditor of *
jja c board, Us Jjfesa exaiTUgfog $iie te.oksj
â 
of the corporation and all money found
to be available from the income of the
stock held by the university is to be used
In the preservation of the property. As
the property cannot be rented by ag-ents
in this city, photographs of the place will
be taken and forwarded to the East with
a view to finding a tenant.
Professor Lewis of the department of
physics was granted leave of absence for
a year, as he is going to Europe.
A communication received from the se
nior class of '99 was read. It was a re
quest for the return of half the diploma
fee deposited by its members In 1595, as
they desire to use it for class day.
Regent Hallidie of the finance commit
tee objected to returning ,Â£he amount
which he said would aggregate $1000. He
moved that the request be denied. Re
gent Budd stated that it only cost $3 for
a diploma, and as the students deposited
$10, the balance should either be returned
or. as in the past, the class be allowed
$400 to defray expenses. The matter was
laid over until the next meeting, as a
month's notice must be given in such
cases. Regent Budd obeyed the rule and
asked that that sum be allowed the grad
uating class to properly conduct its exer
cises.
The committee on buildings and grounds
asked for $1500 to carry on repairs and
Improvements. The committee was
granted $150 a month until the Ist of July,
when the new budget will be made up.
In the discussion that followed the re
quest for money. Regent Budd said that
the committee must have money, and in
timated that the board would have to cut
off some salaries in order to have enough
funds to carry on the work, and he pro
posed to suggest it soon. Regent Halll
dle stated that even if a whole depart
ment was cut out there would be a de
ficit of $3Â» to $700 a year. "It is better."
he said, "to destroy a limb of the uni
versity than to impair the usefulness of
the whole structure."
Professor Fowler, conductor of Farm,
ers' Institute, was allowed $25 a month
additional salary beginning the first of
February.
Professor Slade was granted $100 from
the AVhiting fund to carry on the work
of his department.
It Is probable that the site opposite the
Lick school, corner Sixteenth and Utah
streets, will be purchased by the board
and the Wilmerdmg school erected on it.
The Alhambra.
At the Alhambra this -week "Dewey, the
Hero of Manila," is presented to the usual
larpe house â which the play has been
drawing ever since it was put on. The
songes by Florence Renland were partic
ularly pleasing and the popular ditty by
Charles Swains is so well received that
he is obliged nightly to respond with an
encore. "La Belle Marie" will be put on
next week and the company is busy re
hearsing for its production. In this play
Agnes Herndon will make her first ap- j
pearance. ' [

Cured His Rupture
After Suffering Fifteen Years a
Maine Citizen Recovers.
Remarkable Discovery of a . New
Healing System.
People who have been ruptured for some â 
years generally settle down to the notion that â 
they must end their lives in suffering. Usually
they have tested all sorts of cures and trusses
MR. WALTER J. COLBY, Brunswick. Me.
and give up at last in despair. But now
comes a new plan, a radically different sys-
tem which say 3 positively that any kind of a
rupture, old or recent, bad or slight, can be
cured completely and permanently in a very
short time. The experience of Mr. Colby is {
cited as an evidence of what the new plan J
will accomplish. Mr. Colby was badly rup- j
tured. For fifteen years he lived In constant
dread of strangulation. He tried everything
known in the truss line and still his rupture
was there just as it had been for fifteen years, ;
worse if anything. Some one called his atten- j
tion to the so-called Dr. Rice system, but he j
was skeptical. He sent for an explanation of ;
the plan, and this so appealed to his experi-
ence and sense of the fitness of things that ,
he could not resist the Impulse to try It, skep-
tical as he was.
â¢ The results have more than met expectations,
for not only was hts severe rupture returned j
into the abdomen and securely held there, but j
the cure was absolutely perfect and permanent,
enabling him in a few short weeks to do any j
kind of work without fatigue, bother or feel- |
ing that he had ever been ruptured. It is a
home cure. No pain nor danger can possibly
happen. A person won't lose a moment from
work. There is no operation of any kind and i
the plan is so certain to cure that every rup- j
tured person ought to know all about It. Dr.
Rice has prepared an illustrated book telling
about his discovery in a most convincing man-
ner. He sends the book free to all. Write
for it. If you know others who are ruptured !
tell them to write for this free book, or do
bo yourself. It will be an act of kindness
which they will appreciate. Write to Dr. "W.

i HEART DISEASE.
' SOME FACTS REGARDING THE RAPID IN-
: CREASE OF HEART TROUBLES.
i 'â -â ;
-
Do Not Be Alarmed, but Look for
: the Cause.
I Heart troubles, at " least among the
- Americans, are certainly increasing, and
I while this may be largely due to the ex-
J [ citement and worry of American business
. life. It is more often the result of weak
i stomachs, of poor digestion.
i Real organic disease Is incurable; but
I not one case in a hundred of heart trouble
' j is organic.
The close relation between heart trouble
, i and poor digestion is because both organs
I are controlled by the same great nerves,
Â» the Sympathetic and Pneumogastric.
â¢ ! In another way, also, the heart is af-
| j fected by the form of poor digestion,
â¢ i which causes gas and fermentation from
- , half digested food. There is a feeling of
: j oppression and heaviness in the chest
1 j caused by pressure of the distended stom-'
\ I ach on the heart and lungs, interfering
'. \ with their action; hence arises palpitatioa
â  j and short breath.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood,
; i making it thin and watery which irritates
â  and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment for heart
i trouble is to improve the di^stlon and to
â  Insure the prompt assimilation of food.
This can be done by the regular use
i after meals of some safe, pleasant and ef-
fective digestive preparation, like Stuart's
i Dyspepsia Tablets, which may be found
1 at most drug stores and which contain
1 valuable, harmless digestive elements in
' a pleasant, convenient form.
It is safe to say that the regular persis-
tent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets at
i meal time will cure any form of stomach
trouble except cancer of the stomach.
Full sized package of these tablets sold
1j by druggists at 50 cents. Little book on
j stomach troubles mailed free. Address

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
TWO YEARS
OF HARMONY
IS PREDICTED
Business Men Now
Feel Satisfied.
CONFIDENCE IN R. W. SNOW
HINSDALE MAY SUCCEED
HABBY THOMAS.
Nearly All the Candidates Elected
Monday Have Been Bewarded
for Their Faithful Serv
ices in the Fast.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 14.
Nature sympathized with public feeling
in this city to-day and materially helped
to sink politics in oblivion by washing
from every post and piece of fence thou
sands of cards bearing silent testimony
to the fact that there has just been an
election. Oakland is tired of elections.
and politics, and merchants especially are
glad that attention can now be devoted
to business for the nt-xt year.
Everybody is satisfied with the result
of yesterday's election. The new city
government will be in harmony with Its
various brunchesâ something that has not
been known in many years. Although a
Democrat will hold a seat on the Board
of Works, Mayor Snow and City Attor
ney Dow will control it, and there will
be such a Republican majority in the
Council that it will be perfectly useless
for the two .solitary candidates elected on
other tickets to try to accomplish any
thing, even should they desire it, con
trary to the wishes of the majority. The
whole municipal government will be re
sponsible to the party, and there is no
doubt that the city will derive marked
benefit from such happy conditions.
There will be no over the tax
levy or the fixing of water rates or any
public Improvement during the next two.
years, lor the various department.-- will
be forced to work on the same platform :
and an administration of progress may
be looked for.
Street Superintendent Miller probably
considers himself unfortunate in not be
ing elected City Engineer, but the gen
eral opinion is that he is a lucky man.
Mr. Miller has been Street Superintendent
four years, and ther.' has been a gen
eral d'eslre that ho should continue where
lie is. As a matter of fact, some of the
voters told him prior to election that if
they did not vote for him it would be
because they did not wish to see him
leave his present position. There is no
doubt he will not be disturbed and that
the street department will be as well
managed und-r the new administration as
in the past, and with far more harmony.
Mayor-elect Snow la not a programmer.
He is known to be very independent and
to' express his honest -convictions, even
when his political interests might be best
subserved by Bilence. Oakland feels sale
with Mr. Snow as Mayor, and certainly
his ten years' experience In the Auditor's
office has made him mom fitted for the
high position he will enter upon next
month than any other man who has ever
been Mayor of this city. Business in
ter< Bts cannot help but revive under
these conditions, for with a conservative,
progressive, intelligent and capable ad
ministration merchants will feel confident
that there will be no radical or improvi
dent move made that will tend to disturb
conditions most conducive to prosperity
The City Council will be composed of
men most" of whom have already been
experience in that body. Mne of the
eleven members are Republicans, and
were elected under such circumstances as
to euarantoe united action on all public
matters. Messrs. Cuvellier. Barstow,
Stetson. Mott. Girard. L'pton, Mees<\
Taylor and Rowe constitute the majority.
L, 'Schaeffer and C. Kramm are the mi
nority, although they may prove as use
ful in furthering public interests as the
others As eight votes are necessary to
override the Mayor on any measure,
there can be no friction on this point.
It would not be surprising if Mr Snow s
deputy in the Auditor's office, D. C. Hms
dale "should be appointed secretary of
the new Board of Public Works Mr
Hinsdale can hardly expect to be retained
under the new Auditor, against whom he
â was a competitor in yesterday's election.
â¢It is stated, however, that Mr. Snow and
Mr. Dow will vote to make Mr. Hinsdale
the successor of Harry Thomas.
One of the incidents of yesterday s
election was the practical test given to
the ballot machine invented by Mr. Ellis,
the well-known Livermore newspaper
proprietor. This machine was placed
near the voting booth in the City Hall
Precinct. There was no official character
,to the test, and all voters were invited to
patronize it. During the day 316 voters
recorded their choice, and the machine
â worked to perfection. The voters were
surprised at its simplicity, and during the
day it did not once get out of order.
While there is no means of comparing
the returns printed by the machine with
the official record of the precinct, because
everybody was at liberty to vote, the re
turns of the machine showed perfect ac
curacy in themselves. That 4s to -say,
the total number of votes cast for each
candidate agreed precisely with the total
number of votes cast, and a. comparison
of the ticket with the official ticket tends
to prove its accuracy. Five minutes after
the polls closed the complete returns from
this precinct were printed on the machine
and made public, and not until five hours
later were the official returns made.
The results of yesterday's election show
largely that there is a desire to reward
people who are faithful in office. Mr.
Snow was elected Mayor after serving
ten years faithfully as Auditor. Mr. Dow
' was elected to succeed himself as City
â  Attorney because of his fidelity to the
city's interests during the past four years.
Mr Breed was elected Auditor because
of his hard work as chairman of the
County Central Committee, which largely
contributed to the Republican success last
fall Mr. Miller's defeat was practically
a tribute to his good work in the Street
Department, where he will stay. The
election of Councllmen Cuvellier, Barstow,
Mott Girard. Upton and Rowe is a re
ward' for their past services in the Coun
cil and Treasurer Gilpin was elected be
cause of his honest administration for
six years in that office. The same prin
ciple followed the election of School Di
rectors and Library Trustees.
The figures from the Second v\ ard are
very interesting. Mr. Girard was elected
by about six to one over the man who
had vainly attempted to besmirch him in
his home ward. Mr. Woodward will vote
once more on a water ordinance and then
retire from public life. Out of about a
thousand votes in his ward just seventy
one made him their choice, and it. is note
worthy that in one precinct he received
Just eight votes, which is the exact num
ber of the election officers in that pre
cinct, which the Mayor appointed
Oakland will now willingly bid farewell
for a long time to primaries, campaigns
and elections.
PICTURE BRANDES AS
A TENDER FATHER
WITNESSES FOR DEFENSE TELL
OF HIS GOODNESS.
Wife of the Alleged Murderer Will
Go on the Stand This
Morning.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 14.
The Brandes murder trial has dragged
along eighteen actual days, and even now
it is a question whether this week will
see the end. However, Juror Seiben has
recovered and the taking of testimony
T-aB resumed to-day. . _ ,
JDr. Â£>. p. Crowley, expert forjhe de-j
fense. was again called to the witness
stand, undergoing a rigid cross-exam.na
tion. He stoutly maintained the tnoory
that Lillian Brandes did not die from
blows upon the head, but that death was
due to suicidal banging.
W. H. Friend, Oakland's Postmaster,
was called this afternoon and identified
two money orders for M in all that
Brandes had sent to his daughter while
she was in Santa Cruz. The prosecution
was willing to admit that the accused
had sent the money.
David Rambke, who assisted Brandes
as watchman in Berkeley, and who for
merly roomed in his employer's house,
testified that he heard no noises on -No
vember 16, and that Brandes was always
kind tc bis family.
Mrs. Catherine Kennedy, who has fre
quently visited the accused at the County
Jail, was next called by the defense, tes
tifying that Brandts had always shown
a fatherly tenderness for his daughter,
and that "on one occasion she had seen
Brandes take the girl buggy riding.
On cross-examination by Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Melvln Mrs. Kennedy ad
mitted that she moved from the Brandes
neighborhood before Lillian had come to
live with her mother, and that she hf.d
not seen them go buggy riding, but that
Mrs. Brandes had told her of this.
Mary A. Curley. a dressmaker who
takes orders for dyeing work, said she
met Brandes on November 12 last, when
he ordered a lady's coat dyed red. Later
she met Brandes In the County Jail,
where she frequently goes to do mission
ary work. At the latter time Brandes'
identification as the man who had given
her an order came as a revelation to her.
Mrs. Brandes will take the stand to
day. Her trial has been postponed one
week.
BERNARD M'DERMOTT
FOUND DEAD IN BED
OAKLAND, March 14.â Until August 4
of last year Bernard McDermott. a pio
neer merchant of this city, was prosper
ous, happy and free from all ills. On that
day, however, his store and contents on
Piedmont avenue were destroyed by fire,
and he sustained a shock from which he
never recovered. Often since the fire he
has complained of pains in the region of
his heart, and this morning at his home
on Eighteenth street he was found dead
in bed by his son Charles.

of age and a native of New York City.
CHOYNSKI, THE HEAVY
AND CLEVER PUNCHER
Fhe Very Popular Pugilist and Native Son
Will Soon Face the Spry McCoy
in Mechanics' Pavilion.
JOE CHOYNSKI. who is training for a fistic argument with "Kid" McCoy
on the evening- of the 24th lnst., is located at the Ingleside House, and
feels as confident of defeating the artful "Kid" as he is of entering the
ring when the time comes for the contest of hits and misses.
Eddie Graney, the particular friend and for many years admirer of
Choynskl. on being asked what he thought of the outcome of the battle, did
not hesitate a second in answering the question.
"Why, I can't see how McCoy can best Joe." said he. "I know that Mc-
Coy is faster than Joe, but he cannot land on him as easily as he landed on
Sharkey. Joe is as clever as the bost of them in blocking and ducking
swift blows, and when he lands you know that something must hit the floor.
Choynski is in better condition to-day than he has been in many years to
my knowledge. He was not feeling well when he met Sharkey: still he had
the 'sailor' on Quror street, and it would be hard to say what the result
would, have been had Joe not received that foul punch in the groin which
would have ended the fighting desire of any man who is not as game as a
pebble.
"Choynski. unlike the general ,run of pugilists, has never indulged in
liquors that intoxicate, and as a consequence he can boast of >a sound and
healthy constitution, notwithstanding his ten years' experience as a ring
general.
"McCoy cannot stand heavy punishment. His armor Is too light to re
sist heavy shot. He relies on fast traveling as a means of avoiding injury,
but, although he escaped the several shots that were aimed at him by the
sailor, nearly all of which fell short of their intended ma.rk, you can rest
assured that Joe will aim straight and land when the clever 'Kid' least ex
pects to receive a broadside.
"Sharkey hit McCoy only one good punch during their engagement and
it 'sunk the ship.' Now if short-arm Tom can rench McCoy, don't you
think that Joe can accomplish the same trick? You just wait and see how
some of those wise men who think that Choynski is a back number will open
their eyes when the game is finished. I will admit that McCoy ts as clever
as they make them, but Choynski Is also clever and a harder puncher, and
he will go the distance, too."
The following is a copy of the articles of agreement:
SAN FRANCTSCO. February 17, 1899.
It is hereby agreed between Norman Selby (Kid McCoy) and Joe Choyn
ski to box twenty rounds for a decision before the National Athletic Club, on
or about March 24, 1899, on the following conditions, to-wit:
Firstâ We agree to box for 65 per cent of the gross receipts, the winner
to receive 65 per cent of said 65 per cent of the gross receipts and the loser
35 per cent of the said Go per cent of the gross receipts.
Secondâ We agree to box under Marquis of Queensberry rules, break
away clean, and no hitting in clinches.
Thirdâ We agree to box at catchwelghts.
Fourth â We agree that it shall be optional with the principals to wear
bandages on their hands.
Fifthâ We agree to select the referee 48 hours before the contest.
Sixthâ We agree that the club physician may visit and examine the prin
cipals at their training quarters whenever he deems it advisable.
Seventh â We agree to report to the club the night of the contest In per
fect physical condition ready and willing to carry out this contest.

OAKLAND, March 14.â Before a large
audience to-night Rev. Dr. R. F. Coyle
and Colonel John P. Irish debated the
subject of American expansion, with spe
cial reference to the Philippines.
Chairman S. H. Chamberlain explained
briefly the nature of the debate, which
was opened by Dr. Coyle, who is an ar

said:

unique in American history. We have a I

MAYOR-ELECT R.W. SNOW
ON OAKLAND'S VICTORY
A LARGE minority vote was polled yesterday for my opponent, Mr. Da
vie, but I am persuaded that, If there could be an opportunity given
to-day, the voters would be quick to make my election practically unan
imous. Citizens are coming to see that there can be no success for Oak
land without harmony of purpose.
We have conducted the campaign fostering this idea. We are entering
upon an era of good feeling and pi-ogress will go hand in hand with us.
I desire to take this first opportunity to t-hank the press of this city and
San Francisco for powerful influence in behalf of the government-elect. We
need Its continued support. R- W. SNOW.
civilization. How any one can doubt that
the retention of the Philippines and the
placing of them under American rule will
tend to increase the measure of human
happiness it is difficult to conceive.
T 'There is no imperialism about it. Give
them a stable government, foster their
commercial and civil progress and in turn
they will become an embryo republic. Is
England to be left alone to civilize China,
or is she to have this great republic of
the West to assist in that great task and
to share the beneficial results? Provi
dence wills it that we shall do our duty.
When Kipling wrote of the white man s
burden he winged a shaft that flew di
rect to every American heart. Our energy
cannot be confined, it must expand. We
need the trade of those islands to help
solve the problem of the unemployed. It
Is a new experience, but never yet has the
crisis arisen that the man was not on
hand to cope with it. This is a time when
every true citizen should assume the God
imposed duty and help bear his burden
by standing loyally by our noble Presi
dent in his efforts to grapple manfully
with the great question of this hour."
Colonel Irish had not voiced his first
sentence before it was made plain that he
differed materially from Dr. Coyle in his
opinions. He said:
"In this hour of perplexity we seem to
have ignored our constitution and our
Declaration of Independence. It is as
sumed that the President can do as he
pleases with the Philippines. This is a
self-deception. He can do nothing except
carry out the wishes of Congress. This
is not a question of upholding an admin
istration. It is a question of American
policy. During the past six months a
complete change has come over the mind
of the American people, and after some
sober consideration the nation's mind will
find its level again.
"It is doing so quickly, even now. This
expansion nuestion is a novelty. If the
views of Senator Morgan, that a system
or' expansion is to prevail, we shall soon
have to apologize for the constitution
and the Declaration of Independence. W e
cannot buy the Philippines from SDain
and govern them under a constitution
that declares 'All Governments derive
their just powers from the consent of the
governed.' Filipinos don't want our
Government, and just now we are fight
ing them under the guise of civilizing
them and offering them tho Bible and t!i"
rifle with thf threat that if they do not
take the former they will get the con
tents of the latter.
"Tho first year of this experience will
cost us five hundred millions of dollars.
We are told that when peace is restored
we will fax the islands .â â¢ml get it all
back. What? Do what we chastised Ens
land for doing, for we hear nothing of
givinpr the Filipinos representation at
Washington. Every inch of territory we
have ever acquired has been by purchase,
or treaty with the red man. But now
we have suddenly changed. We can
never colonize those islands, for it has
been proved that no temperate zone pi â¢ -
pie ever live to the third generation in
tropical climates. When this dream has
vanished, we shall probably decide to
learn a lesson from Spain-poor Spain.
Four hundred years ago her hidalgws and
nobles were clamoring for expansion.
Her people expanded and tried to found
colonies in the Philippines. Spain's ex
pansion led to concentration after wast
ing huge fortunes trying to do that which
all history has declared to be impossible
â establish a colony of temperate sone
people under a vertical sun. That is
what the expansionists are also trying
to do." ___________
AGAINST
OLD IN YEARS BUT
YOUNG IN HEART
MAN OF THREESCORE AND TEN
TAXES A BRIDE.
Edward Eccleston Marries Miss
Fanny Mary Averell. Who Is : <
Half a Century Old.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
142S Park street, March 14.
Edward Eccleston and Fanny Mary
Averell were married this evening at 1229 j
Regent street. The ceremony was per- i
formed by Rev. Edward Bccleston of |
Fresno, a nephew of the groom. Mr. Ec
cleston has been on earth the allotted
"three score and ten," while his bride has i
enjoyed just half a century of life. The i
wedding took place at the home of Mrs. I
Rebekah Mosher, aged 80 years, a sister j
of the groom's first wife. Mrs. Ecclestan ;
has been Mrs. Mosher's housekeeper, and
it was while acting in this capacity that
she met her husband. Mrs. Mosher acted j
as bridesmaid, while James Eccleston, :
aged 84, filled the bill as best man. Only |
the immediate relatives of the couple at
tended the wedding. '
- Mr Eccleston, the groom, is a pioneer
of the State. He crossed the plains in
1849, and later took a trip back East by i
the same route. In the early fifties he
passed through Death Valley, and was a
member of the party that discovered Yo- I
semite Valley. He is a brother-in-law of |
Julius Chester, the well-known writer on \
agricultural subjects. Mr. Eccleston owns j
considerable property in the vicinity of
Bakerslleld and in Butte C6unty.
When seen this evening the aged bene
dict stated that he did not see anything
funny or unusual in plunging into matri- |
mony at his stage of life. The bride re
fused to discuss the nuptials. The aggre- j
gate age of the four old folks who played â¢
the principal parts in the ceremony is 284
J When Mr. Eccleston paid for the mar
riage license this afternoon he asked the
Deputy County Clerk if the office did not
give trading stamps, and was much dis
appointed when informed that it did not,
as he stated he expected to use them in
securing a present for his bride.

FOLSOM STREET
WHARF FOR THE
U. S. TRANSPORTS
The Chamber of Com-
merce Requests It.
THE BERKELEY'S SMASH-UP
mr. McCarthy and his was
REVENUE STAMP.
Terry Building Bents Are Yet in a
Confused and Slow-Moving
State of Adjust
ment.
At a meeting of the Board of Harbor
Commissioners yesterday afternoon the
matter of assigning a berth to the United
States transports was considered, and it
was decided that Folsom street wharf be
set apart for that service.
The question was opened by Commis
sioner Herold submitting a resolution
that the assignment of that wharf for
merly made to the Alaska Commercial
Company and Alaska Pa.-king Association
be rescinded from May 1 and they be given
the Fremont street wharf as soon as
needed alterations can be made there;
also that Folsnm wharf be assigned to the
Government on that date.
Captain Nelson, heading a delegation
from ihe Chamber of Commerce, and Mr.
Bberwood of the Merchants' Association,
appeared at this juncture and spoke of
tho urgent need of quickly providing a
suitable berth for the transports. If the
United States could find no wharves in
this port for the use of its steamers it
would aend them to other ports, and the
commercial interests of San Francisco
would suffer in consequence. Captain Nel
son asked, if docks were so scarce here,
Why the naval militia vessel Marlon was
permitted to occupy a Howard street
wharf right in the busiest part of the
water front. He complained of excessive
dock charges, and referred to the nomi
nal wharfage charged at other places â
Seattle, tor instance.
Commissioner Harney interrupted Cap
tain Nelson by reading a communication
he had recently received from Mayor
Thomas of Seattle. The substance of this
letter was that the Port "Warden and har
bor master of that port, one person, re
ceived $900 per year, and th^re were no
wharf charges on vessels loading and un
loading there, as only one wharf was
owned by the city, the others belonging
to private persons. Cargoes, however,
were charged 25 and 50 cents per ton.
la lying up at any wharf were
charged by the private owners from $1 to
$M per day. Mr. Harney stated that this
system of charges made the outlay for
the ship owner about equal to the port
charges of Pan Francisco.
Here Commissioner Colnon offered an
amendment to the resolution to the effect
that Folsom street wharf be turned over
to the transports April 15, which amend
ment Harney and Herold voted down.
Harney stated that it would be thirty or
forty days before any transports came
along and the rains would be over before
the Alaska companies would have to
move out from under the shedded Folsom
street wharf.
United States Quartermaster I^ong by
telephone stated that April 15 would be
more satisfactory than May 1, and his re
quest fur the former date prevailed.
Relative to this change President H. F.
Fortmann of the Alaska Packers' Asso
ciaticr. states that his company will move
from Kolpnm to Fremont street wharf
most willingly. Since October the asso
ciation has permitted the transports to
use tho FolÃom wharf, though It has paid
rental to the State. The firm has
even loaded vessels from other wharves.
President Fortmann ohjected to some of
Captain Nelson's statements regarding
the position of the Packers' Association
in the matter. He said there would be
more practical sense In the association
removing to Seattle than the trans
ports. The company could get its sup
plies, especially coal and lumber, cheaper
on Puget Sound, and as 95 per cent of its
market was in the East, the railroad fa
cilities were as good from those ports as
from San Francisco. He repeated that
any intimation that his company placed
eny difficulties in the way of the .Gov
ernment acquiring a wharf was incorrect.
Then came the opening of bids for re
pairing the wrecked dolphins at the en
trance of the ferry slips. These piles
were smashed on several occasions by the
new propeller ferry steamer Berkeley
when F.ne became unmanageable and
plunged her nose in among the wharf
timbers.
The State will have the work of repair
done by contract, and send the bill to the
Bouthern Pacific Company. There were
eight bidders, and their proposals ran
from $3400 to $2742. the lowest bid being
that of the Dundon Bridge Company.
This proposal was itemized as follows:
133 new piles at $16 $2128
29 old piles driven at $6 174
20 M feet new lumber at $22.... 440
Total $2742
Mr. McCarthy, whose bid was about
$3200. looked over the other proposals and
found that his was the only one adorned
with a war revenue stamp. He demanded
that the other seven bids be thrown over
board. Mr. McCarthy was informed by
Attorney Budd that a mere proposal was
not a taxable commodity and that his
stamp was a dead loss.
By resolution of the board all the bids
for work on the Broadway wharves were
rejecter!.
The matter of the rents of the new ferry
privileges are still in a confused state of
adjustment, and the subject did not come
before the board. It has been decided,
however, that the Wells-Fargo Express
Company will pay $250 per month.
COURSING WILL CONTINUE.
Ingleside Club Will Hold the Largest
Meeting of the Season.
An executive meeting of the Ingleside
Coursing Club was held last evening, and
after discussing the ordinance passed by
the Supervisors which prohibits the sell-
Ing of pools on horse and dog racing it
decided to follow out the programme ar
ranged at the last meeting of the board,
so as not to disappoint the large number
of leashmen who nave gone to consider
able expense in training dogs for this
ppeclal meeting, which was announced to
be held at Ingleside Park on Friday (St.
Patrick's day). Saturday and Sunday
next. The drawing for the three days of
coursing will be held at Pythian Castle
on Thursday evening at 8 o'clock, and
doubtless a large gathering of sportsmen
who are interested in the game will be
present to hear what the president of the
club, D. Shannon, will Bay regarding the
future of the sport at the popular Ingle-
Bide Park.

Terrible Experience of a Crab-
Fisher off Point Bonita During
Yesterday's Storm.
FrV"E short blasts and a long one I
from the lighthouse station on
Point Bonita created consterna
tion In shipping circles yesterday
morning. It was the distress sig
nal, and the first time It echoed across
the Golden Gate was when the mail
company's steamer City of New York
went ashore in a fog below the light
house.
When the signal blew for the second
time yesterday the wind was blowing
60 miles an hour from the northeast,
the fog had shut down until it was
Impossible to see across the Golden
Gate, squall after squall struck the
lighthouse, and it was a nasty morn
ing.
During a lull in the storm the light
keeper fancied he heard a cry for help.
He waited until the squall had passed.
The cry came again, and again was
drowned by the gale. The keeper
made a tour of the reservation, but
the fog veui so thick that he could not
see anything, nor could he locate the
direction from which the cries came.
It was then he sounded the distress
signal.
Across the Golden Gate John Hyslop
was on the lookout for the Merchants'
Exchange, while a short distance from
him was the lookout for the Golden
Gate Life Saving station. Hyslop was
the first to make out the "distress sig
nal," and he at once notified the ex
change. It did not take long to let
the tug companies know, and in a few
moments the Shipowners" Company
had the Sea King and the Spreckels
Company the Relief on the way to the
scene. The King had a good three
quarters of a mile start, but the Re
lief overhauled her at Fort Point and
was easily first to Point Bonita. Cap
tain Clem Randall slowed down and
made an examination of the shore
line, but could see no trace of a dis
aster.
Half a dozen crab nets were out, but
there was no sign of the crab boats,
and the captain remarked to his mate:
"I wouldn't be a bit surprised if a few
fishermen had been drowned."
From Point Bonita the Sea King and
Relief went out through the north
channel and up the coast as far as
Bolinas. No sign of a wreck could be
seen nor was any vessel in distress
sighted, so both tugs returned to port.
In the meantime the life saving sta
tions had been notified and Captain
Hodgson of the Fort Point station,

The police are Fearehing for two day

of Miss Alma Wessenberg at 71 Henry

jewelry valued at several hundred dollars
and a quantity of silverware. Last, night
Miss "Wessenberg visited police headquar

Shortly before noon on Monday Miss
Wessenberg left her home to do some
shopping. She returned several hours
later and was surprised to find the front
door securely fastened. Thinking that
one of the occupants had unconsciously
bolted the door, she went to the rear and
was astonished to see the window broken
and half opened. Suspecting something
wrong she summoned a neighbor, who
promptly entered the house. A casual
glance convinced him that tho bouse cad
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, HAKCH 15, 18 99.
Captain Varney of the Golden Gate
station and Captain Smith of the
South Side station soon had their
boats in the water and under way.
Smith and his crew had to go from
four miles south of the Cliff House to
Bakers. Beach, as they could not
launch their own boat, but even with
that handicap they were not far be
hind tho others. When they all got
acrops the Golden Gate no trace of a
disaster could be found. Captain
Hodgson ran his boat in as close to
the beach as possible and then jumped
ashore, taking with him a gun and
shot line. He clambered up the face
of the cliff and joined the lighthouse
keeper, who was waiting for him.
At that instant the cry for help
came again. It seemed to come from
the ocean side of the promontory and
thither the men made their way. An
other faint and despairing cry brought
them to the cave where the new life
paving station is to be built. The men
made their way around the cliff and
heard the cry of help distinctly.
Clinging to a rock, over which the
waves broke every few seconds, was
a fisherman. His boat was not far
away, bottom up, but the rock was
the better refuge, and to it the fisher
man clung.
Hodgson and the men from the
lighthouse did not waste any time
about getting the man off the rock.

an entrance through the window the des

everything of value.
Miss Wcssenberg, before leaving her
home, had placed her jewelry in a bureau
drawer, which the burglars forced open,
presumably with a "Jimmy." They ap
propriated the contents, which consisted
of several rings, a gold watch and a dia
mond brooch. Evidently dissatisfied with
their haul, the thieving pair started to
pry open a trunk containing some costly
wearing apparel, but were frightened off
by the return of Miss Wessenberg.
The detectives are satisfied that the
men were in the act of breaking open
the trunk, intending not to overlook any
thing of value, when Miss Wessenberg
returned. After she tried the front door.

LIEUTENANT NEALL MAY
RETURN AT ANY TIME
FRIENDS VILL MAKE GOOD HIS
SHORTAGES.
The Young Officer Is Believed to
Have Been in Hiding Some
where in Mexico.
There is now reason to believe that
First Lieutenant John Neall will shortly
return and take his punishment like a
man and soldier. It will be remembered
that on February 15 Lieutenant Neall dis
appeared from the Presidio, and that a
shortage was discovered in his accounts
as canteen officer of $2000, as well as a
shortage in the accounts of the Presidio
Club, of which Lieutenant Neall was the
secretary. Ever since the occurrence the
friends of the officer have been at work
in his behalf to see what could be done.
Lieutenant Neall was extremely popular,
and there was not a more efficient officer
in the service. It has been maintained by
his friends that if he could only tell his
own story there would be found some
mitigating circumstances connected with
his disappearance. So excellent is his past
record that it is known the highest offi
cials of the army were Interested in his
case and that their influence could be
counted on in his behalf.
It is said that Lieutenant Neall has
He was on the outermost end of a
small reef and hard to get at, but with
the aid of the gun and the shot line
he was finally landed on the beach
more dead than alive. The boat, al
though capsized, was anchored, and
after some dangerous work it also was
secured, righted and anchored in a
sheltered spot.
The crab fisherman's name is Antone
Razeto. According to his story told in
the lighthouse, he went out early to
catch crabs. It was not blowing hard
and he did very well. About 9 o'clock
it began to blow and he made up his
mind to get back inside. An hour later
it was blowing a gale and the fisher
man found he could not weather
Point Bonita. He got into the little
cove and there came to anchor, but
the big seas came rolling In and cp.p
sized the boat. He got on the bottom,
but was washed off again and again.
Then he managed to get on the rock
and to it he clung, calling for help
every time there was a lull in the
wind, until his rescuers came. Had it
not been for Captain Hodgson of the
life-saving station Razeto would have
undoubtedly been drowned, as there
are neither life lines nor boat at the
lighthouse. To the lightkeeper be
longs a good share of credit, however.
On the way back from Bolinas the
tug picked up the lifeboats and towed
them to Fort Point. Razeto was too
exhausted to be moved, so he was left
at the lighthouse.
been In correspondence with his wife, and
that it is through her influence that he
may be induced to return. It is posi
tively knowji that Mrs. Neall wrote to
General ShaTter seeking- his influence in
behalf of her husband. The general was
unable to promise her anything unless
Lieutenant Neall returned and gave him
self up. However, General Shafter has
only the highest opinion of the unfortu
nate officer, and it is known that he will
do everything possible in his power to see
that he is accorded every leniency. If
Lieutenant Neall returns there is no
doubt that through the assistance of his
friends he will be able to make good his
shortage, which will leave only the mili
tary offense against him. At present
Lieutenant Neall is thought to be in Mex
ico, and it is reported that he may arrive
here by the last of the week.
General Shafter, when seen last night,
said he knew nothing about the intended
return of the officer oeyond what he had
seen In the papers, and that he could not
discuss the matter until Lieutenant Neall
had returned. It is thought that the cav
alryman will return and stand trial for
his breach of military discipline, and after
that he will resign from the army. His
ruin was wrought by gambling, but be
yond this there is nothing that can be
brought against him. The charges that
the officer was infatuated with a woman
of questionable character is not true, as
has been proven. Beyond his one weak
ness, which resulted so disastrously
Lieutenant Neall possessed qualities both
as a man and a soldier that made him
popular and deserving of every extenua
tion possible, and this he will receive if
he returns.
Another Operatic Star Here.
The Ellis Opera Company received a
strong addition from New York last
night in the person of Antonio Ceppi. the
great Italian tenor. He sang with Grau
at the Metropolitan Opera House last
Wednesday night, was released by that
management and rushed across the conti
nent. He is over six feet tall, is the only
rival of Tamagno, and will sing Rhari

Madame Gadskl makes her debut.

LOBBYING IN SACRAMENTO
LYNCH, HAMILTON, STEPPACH
ER AND SHAEN NAMED.
Customs Weigher Rhodes and As
sistant Sharkey Booked for Dis
missal From the Service
for Drunkenness.
Complaints were lodged a few days ago
with Special Agents Linrk and Smith
that a largo number of Federal officials
were not giving to the duties of their of
fices that attention which they would he
obliged to give were they working for
themselves or for business men. It was
said that several of the delinquents spent
the greater part of their time In Sacra
mento lobbying in the Senatorial contest
and had left their offices in charge of
their male deputies and female typewrit
ers, to the great detriment of the service.
Among those complained of are Internal
Revenue Collector Lynch, his chief dep
uty, Jake Steppacher; Colonel "Billy"'
Hamilton, cashier of the Custom-house,
and Assistant Appraiser Jake Shaen. Mr.
Steppacher has not done a day's work in
the office since the opening of the legis
lative session nearly three months ago,
and the others have practically lived in
the State capital during the same period.
The special agents informed the com
plainants that it was the official duty of
the special agents to report to the Sec
retary of the Treasury all cases of dere
liction of duty. It did not matter to
them whether the culprit was a Presiden
tial appointee or an underling, the fault
was the same. They have already made
an investigation of the complaints, and
have found that the officials named have
boon neglectful of their duties for which
they are being paid, as charged. For In
stance, tho agents went to Appraiser Dare
for information as to the absence of As
sistant Shaen.. Mr. Dare replied that
Mr. Shaen had not averaged more than
four hours a week since hia appointment
about a year ago.
Charges nf drunkenness, neglect of duty
and conduct unbecoming Federal offi
cials preferred against Customs Weigher
Rhodes and Assistant Weigher Thomas
J. Sharkey have been investigated, and
the agents will recommend the dismissal
of Messrs. Rhodes and Sharkey from the
Bervice of the Government. Both m^n
have gone on sprees and absented them
selves from their posts for days and days
iit a time. Rhodes was investigated on a
similar charge some two years ago, but
escaped expulsion through political influ
ence, the plea of first offense and "won't
da BO any more." Another charge against
Rhodes is that of being a persistent bor
rower of money from brother officials and
others and a lapse of memory In regard
thereto when payday came around.
Rhodes and Sharkey are booked for an
early dismissal and the other and more
Influential shirkers of duty will hear from
the Treasury- Department in no uncertain
tones.
SHIP BIDSTON HILL CHARTEBED
She Will Carry Supplies for the
Troops at the Philippines.
The weatner was very "dirty" outside
yesterday, and all the coasters kept off
shore. Early In the morning It was only
blowing sixteen miles an hour from the
southeast, but at 10 a. m. the gale had
increased to 50 miles an hour. At noon
It had dropped to 40. At 3 p. m. was only

glass was falling rapidly. The schooners

Charges Made Against an Organ Which Judge Conlan as
a Musical Critic Investigated to His Sorrow.
The discordant notes of an electric pipe
organ In the free lecture room of an anat
omical museum at 510 Pine street have
disturbed the merchants in the vicinity
to such an extent that they are up in
arms over the matter. Instead of con
sidering the organ a musical instrument,
'â¢a thing of beauty and a Joy forever,"
the business men term it an instrument
of torture which, if used in the days of
the inquisition, would have been a more
horrible punishment than the rack.
When the outraged auricular organs of
the business men had become bo tor
tured that it seemed impossible to stand
the nuisance longer, and when trade fell
off on account of the disinclination of cus
tomers to endure the electrical discords,
the interference of the law was sought.
A warrant was sworn out for the arrest
of Charles R. Tufts who operates the
infernal machine, and yesterday his case
came up in Judge Conlan's court, where
he was tried on the charge of maintain
ing a nuisance. Merchants along Kearny
street testified that the organ was a det
riment to their business and several
guests from the California stated that the
noise made by the Instrument disturbed
their slumbers. The owners of the ma
chine deposed that it was a musical in
strument of the highest grade, and that
the tunes it played were elevating.
I'nable to determine from the testimony
what ruling should be made in the case
his Honor, the Judge, expressed a desire
to hear what the defendant claimed was
music and the plaintiffs asserted to be
similar to the braying of a donkey. An
offer to bring the instrument into court
was speedily rejected by the Judge, who
announced that he would visit the place
where the bone of contention is kept.
Last evening, accompanied by the clerk
of his court and a few friends, his Honor
started for the scene of the trouble. As

he passed along Kearny street merchants
rushed from their doors and poured into
the ears of the Judge their tales of woe.
One asserted that the instrument made
more noise than a steam calliope; another
that it was a "rattler." His salesmen,
he claimed, would become so "rattled"
when the electricity was turned on that
they could not wait on customers and
the latter were generally so affected by
the heart-rending tones that they would
get out of earshot with all possible speed.
All prayed the Judge to see tnat tne nuis
ance was abated.
By request of the court the music box
was started. His Honor turned with the
first shot and fled for a neighboring sa
loon, but the strains of "Hail Columbia"
followed him every step of the way like
an avenging angel. With his fingers in
his ears, and trailed by the party he â had
brought along to protect him, the Judge
sought saloon after saloon, but the "yiN
lain still pursued him." At a resort where
elixir of destruction is dispensed, foui
blocks from the stable of the beast, the>
sound was so nerve-shaking that it mad*
the stale beer foam.
"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old
Town." "The Marseillaise." "God Save the
Queen" and "Ma Honey Boy" all sounded
alike to the Judge. He was told con
fidentially that the machine was only
t
turned on half force and he thanked
Providence that such was the case. A
merchant informed him that the organ
had been to a music store and been fixed
earlier in the day. and he muttered sottc
voce that he thought It needed more
"flxin'." Wagner wasn't in it with the
music box for noise. The Judge is a lover
of grand opera, and the strains of the in
strument grated on the musical ear which
was enraptured by the warbling of Melba
the ntght before; so when the case comes
up Thursday it is believed that should
his Honor recover sufficiently from the
experience of yesterday to attend court
the organ will be sent up tor six months.
