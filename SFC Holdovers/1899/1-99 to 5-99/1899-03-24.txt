A WAR OF RACES
RAGES IN ARKANSAS
TEXARKAXA, Ark., March 23.â
A race war is on in Little River
County, and during the past
forty-eight hours a number of
negroes have mot their death at
the hands of an infuriated white popu
lation. Seven are known to have been
lynched, shot to death or slain in some
mam the work is not yet done.
The bodies of the victims of the mob's
vengt-ance are hanging to the limbs of
trees in various parts of the country,
strung up wherever they were taken,
while that of another who was shot to
death while trying to escape was
thrown into a creek and left there. The
country is in a state of most intense
excitement. White men are collecting
in mobs heavily armed and deter
mined; negroes are fleeing for their
lives and I munity is in an up
roar. The exact number of negroes who

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, March 23.
Politicians here regard the sugges
tion of the nomination of Speaker Reed
for Vice President on a ticket with
President McKinley as even more ab
surd than the recent suggestion of the
.nomination of Governor Roosevelt. No
one who knows Mr. Reed believes that
he would consider a proposition to take
second place on the ticket for a mo
ment. His one political ambition Is to
be elected President, and failing in that
he will rest content with the high rep
utation he has made for himself as
Speaker of the House. It is well
known that Mr. Reed regards the of
fice of Speaker as superior in Itself to
that of Vice President.
It is believed here that Vice Presi
dent Hobart will probably be renoml
nated for Vice President. Mr. Hobart
has made more out of the office of
Vice President than any man who has
filled it in recent years. He has pre
sided over the Senate with dignity and
ability, and has the respect and es
teem of every member of that body.
' In addition to this he has done what
few Vice Presidents have done in re
cent years, in that he has worked in
the closest harmony with the Presi
dent He has been given the confi
dence of Mr. McKinley to as great a
degree as any member of the Cabinet,
and in return his advice has been on
more than one occasion a distinct helD
to the President. It is urged that if
the nomination of Hobart was wise In
1896 it will be doubly so. in 1900.

varying In number from twenty-five to
fifty, are scouring the country for them.
Wherever one is found he is quickly
strung up, his body perforated with
leaden missiles to make sure of th^ir
work, and the mob hastens on in quest
of its next victim. Some of th<-m
were found near Richmond, and the
work of dispatching the first two or
three was an easy matter.
But the news soon spread among: the
negroes, who, instead of making the re- j
sistance and offering the battle that
they had threatened, became panic-
Etricken and began getting out of the
community as quickly as possible. Two
whose names were on the list of con
spirators got a good start of the men
who were detailed to look after them
and succeeded in reaching the Texas
line before being captured. How
ever, they did not escape. They were
overtaken out of breath and exhausted,
but were swung up without ceremony.
The trouble arose over the killing of
James Stockton by Duckett. Just prior
to the lynching of Duckett the negroes
had planned the inauguration of a race
war. Duckett was the leader, and at
his death the negroes let the matter
out and the citizens became greatly en
raged.
Another negro, named Joe King, re
marked that Stockton should have been
murdered sooner. He was taken to the
woods and whipped, as was also John
Johnson. Other negroes made threats,
but nothing occurred until yesterday,
when the dead body of Goodwin was
found hanging to a tree just across Red
River from the Stockton farm in Bowie
County, Texas. He formerly worked
for Stockron and was chased across
Mud Creek. The place where the trou
ble occurred is several miles from any
town of communication and it is ditli
cult to obtain details, as th^ people are
very reluctant about giving cut the
news. A Justice of the Peace went to
where Goodwin was hanged.

YOUNGER BROTHERS
MAY BE PAROLED
ST. PAUL, Minn., March 23.â The pros
pects of the Younger boys being released
from State prison are much brighter to
day. The bill which permits the parole
of ilfe prisoners after twenty years' im
prisonment, with uninterrupted good be
havior, was yesterday defeated in the
Senate, but to-day Senator Wilson had
the bill reconsidered and after an amend- I
ment was adopted, requiring the approval I
by the Board of Pardons of such paroles !
by the Board of Prison Managers, the hill i
was passed by a vote of (8 <<> ;,. The Hoard j
of Pardons has heretofore strongly im

river several negroes have been lynched.
This morning Benjamin Jones was
found dead on Hurricane Bend, and
from New Boston it is learned that Joe j
King and Moses Jones were found j
hanging to trees at Horseshoe Curve
to-day. Another Jones is missing. In
the gang that was plotting for a race |
war were twenty-three negroes, and it |
is likely that the entire number kave
been strung up in the thickets. The
negroes are fleeing from the district.
To-day three wagons full arrived at |
Texarkana, having crossed Red River
at Index at midnight last night. They j
were greatly frightened. The citizens
of Little River County have suffered j
much recently from lawlessness. Some
months ago the two races clashed at
Allene at a sawmill and a small riot
followed. From all accounts it seems
that with Duckett seven of the ring
leaders have been killed.
NEGROES BRUTALLY
SHOT TO DEATH
JACKSON, Miss., March 23.â Three j
n-groes were taken from an officer of |
the law and lynched by an armed mob j
near Silver City, in Yazoo County, last
Saturday evening. After being shot to
| death the bodies of the victims were
weighted with bundles of cotton bale
ties and thrown into the Yazoo River.
j The negroes were:
MINOR WILSON.
C. C. REED.
WILLIS BOYD.
They were the ringleaders of the .
>es in a race encounter on the Mid
night plantation early last week. They
â  were arrested and taken to Yazoo City
' and held in jail. The offense, with which
they were charged having been com
mitted in Sharkey County, the Sharkey
authorities were notified and last Fri
; day evening Deputy Constable Sylves-
I ter arrived and the prisoners were
I turned over to him. The constable
boarded the steamer Rescue with the
negroes on Saturday morning and
reached Silver City with them. Ail
that is further known is that the
: negroes fell into the hands of the mob
at this point, were shot to death and
thrown into the river as above stated.
The feeling against these negroes has
been very bitter on account of the dis
turbance at the Midnight plantation
last week in which they, with two other
rades, had fired upon two whites on
the public road. A horse belonging to
i one of the white men was wounded,
1 but the men were not harmed.
THE AWFUL
HORRORS OF
THE FAMINE
Russian Peasants in the
Volga Provinces Dying
by Thousands.
HELP IS NEEDED NOW
Red Cross Society Has Exhausted
Its Funds and Can Do Noth
ing More.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 23.â The
newspapers of the city publish piti
able accounts of the condition of the
so-called famine districts of Russia,
especially Samara, in the eastern part
of European Russia. The efforts of the
Red Cross Society have staved off tli<
horrors of actual starvation, but the
society's funds are almost exhausted,
and the dire distress, compelling the
consumption of all kinds of garbage,
has produced an epidemic of terrible
mortality with typhus, scurvy and
other pestilential diseases.
The peasants are compelled to sell
everything and are living In cold, damp
and filthy cabins. Weakened by hun
ger, they fall ready victims to typhas
and acute scurvy. Unless the Govern
ment gives prompt aid the Volga pro
vinces appear doomed to a repetition of
the horrors of 1891 and 1892.
O'MELVENEY'S CAREER.
Well Known in Los Angeles, Where
He Has Prominent Relatives.
LOS ANGELES. March 23.-E. H.
O'Melveney, who has good connections
in L-os Angeles, and who disappeared from
this city under peculiar circumstances
: early last July, is reported as being pur
by a posse of Deputy Sheriffs in
Washington on a charge of assault with
to commit murder. O'Melveney
went to Lonrais soon after his departure
from L<*s Angeles and assumed the name
of K. H. Melrose. He also received mail
' under his true name. O'Melveney is a
son of the late Judge O'Melveney, who
was one of the most respected citizens of
this city, and a brother of Henry W.
O'Melveney, the well-known attorney of
the firm of Graves, O'Melveney & Shank-
O'Melveney at the t'me of his sudden
disappearance was considered wealthy,
and was a stockholder and president of
the California Truck Company. After
his departure his stock in the concern
was taken up by members of the com-
I pany. O'Melveney lived on Melrose street,
! this city, and it is supposed he took his
; assumed name from that fact. The an
nouncement of the trouble in which he is
entangled is the first intimation his former
I business associates, have had of his
whereabouts since he left Los Angeles.

PREPARING
TO ADVANCE
ON MALOLOS
War Department Expects to
Hear Something Definite
From Otis.
NATIVES LACK GUNS
There Is No Positive Knowledge of
the Strength of Aguinaldo's
Army.
Special Dlspatrh to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel.
Washington. March 23.
War Department officials are hourly
expecting advices from Manila that the
forces under General otls have made
a quick advance upon the Filipino
hosts. They are reticent regarding the
recent instructions sent to command
ers, but the feeling pervades the War
building that the decisive blow ought
to be struck before the rainy season
advances, and before Aguinaldo gets a
chance to mass his troops.
Not much stock is taken here in the
reports that Aguinaldo intends mak
ing a supreme effort to march in the
direction of Manila. The officials have
an idea that he will not give battle,
but will from now on act on the de
fensive. It would be better for him.
they Bay, to bushwhack and to have his
fighters remain in the swampy country
of the interior, where the roads are
such poor excuses that the American
troops cannot use them for the move
ment of heavy artillery. Army experts,
however, hope that the insurgents will
stand and fight, for they see therein
the speedy ending of the rebellion.
War Department officials do not at
tempt to explain why General Lawton
and his fresh troops are so lone: kept
out of action. They talk as if that
matter is left entirely to the discretion
of General Otis.
The strength of Aguinaldo's army Is
not known at the War Department, but
is estimated at between 25.000 and 30.
--000 men. Not all of these are equipped
with rifles, however, and the effective
force will probably not number more
than 15,000. The fact that firearms are
rarely found on the battlefield : t Â£,tÂ»fc,A
skirmish with the Filipinos, arid 1 that
a strong reserve usually attends their
firing line, and never participates in the
fighting, is believed to indicate there
are many more men than rifles In the
Filipino ranks.
While the department has not been
officially informed of the rearrange
ment of the positions of General Otis
around Manila, it is believed that the
greatest force has been established
north of the city, while the men who
were stationed at Laguna de Bai and
along the Papier River have r>een or
dered to proceed to the north of the
island, in order to flank Aguinaldo's
army, should he suddenly advance on
Manila.
GENERAL OTIS IS
BEGINNING TO MOVE
MANILA, March 23.â A general en
gagement with the rebel force* may he
expected at any mmnpnt. Tn fact I
am led to the conclusion that to-mor
rmv will show most important develop
ments. On every hand are evidences
of husy preparation to strike a final
and crushing blow. The arrival of the
reinforcements on the transports Grant
and Sherman, with the Sheridan due
in a few days, has given new spirit to
the American forces.
There are reports that th<=> rebel cause
is gaining adherents In the northern
end of the island. The general feeling
among natives hero in Manila, how
ever, po far as it is given outward ex
pression, is of submission to the situ
ation.
The Oregon regiment, the Twenty
second Infantry and the troops of Gen
eral Wheaton's brigade have been con
centrating all morning at Caloocan in
the rear of General 11. G. Otis' front.
Army tugs now command Malabon and
preparations are making for a decisive
battle, but no movement looking toward
an advance has yet heen begun. There
is every indication that Otis has de
cided to crush the insurgents' forces
and end the insurrection. The Seven
teenth Infantry disembarked to-day
and was at once moved into position.
Last night Private John Muhr and
Sergeant Cohen of the Kansas Volun
teers were killed in a skirmish.
Prisoners who have been brought in
within the last twenty-four hours say
that the rebels have the "last ditch"
feeling, and will make the most decis
ive stand they have yet taken.
The second line of defense occupied
by the rebel forces is between San M;i
teo and Mannaliches. There are rows
of trenches one after another, and the
advance of our troops can only be step
by step, with resistance to be expected
at every trench. But there is no lack
of spirit and fighting desire among the
American soldiers. Their courage is
simply immense. The volunteers, es
pecially, are eager to fight.
The weather now is most favorable
and there are only 875 men reported in
the hospitals. The troops under Gen
eral Mac Arthur, holding the strong line
to the north, are provided with shelter
to keep off the sun, and as they have no
marching to do and are not exposed,
they are generally vÂ«ry healthy.
General Lloyd Wheaton has been put
ting the men under him through some
lively campaigning since he landed, but
they are now resting and recuperating
and are in fair condition.
General Otis expressed himself to
day as satisfied with the situation so
far as the Vlsaya Islands are con
cerned.
AMERICA'S DEATH HARVEST
What It Cost in Human Lives for the
United States to Go to War
With Spain.
â¢ IÂ»â  he records of the United States navy and of the "United States army are complete now to tell
the harvest of death that Americans reaped in the war with Spain. The tabulated state- 0
I ments relate, in the language of an accountant, the tragic story of the cost in American
T lives. These statements, which will follow, have been obtained by special dispatch. In many ways,
% by contrast and by association, they are deeply significant. They show that the navy in action lost only 9
18 men and the army 329. The navy, free from the horrors of a strange and tropical, disease-breeding
climate, lost by disease no more than it would naturally have done in time of peace â 56 men. The army,
0 forced upon an unfriendly land, surrounded with the death-dealing elements of a tropic climate, lost by O
1 disease 5277 men, a terrible total, representing an army which suffered all the soldiers' penalty with
i I none of the soldiers' glory. The records are of grave interest and are given in the dispatch that fol-
Tlows. It should be remembered that the records do not include casualties subsequent to March 1:
WASHINGTON, March 23.â The records of the Navy Department show the following casualties
during the war with Spain: !
â¢ Killed in action, 18, of whom one died of heat exhaustion during action, one more fell down an
embankment, breaking his neck during action, and one was accidentally killed during action by drop- q
I ping his pistol, which exploded, killing him. A total of 56 men died of disease, but this is less than in |
, â¢ time of peace and includes all the ailments of the sailors, and is not traceable to the war. y
a The War Department records, which are made up from official casualty lists to the Ist of March, 9
show:
O Killed in action, 329; died of wounds, 125; died of disease, 5277. Total, 5731.

MUNKACSY, FAMOUS
PAINTER, IS DYING
BERLIN, March 23.â Michael Mun
kacey, the famous Hungarian
painter, who has been secluded in
a hospital for the insane at Bonn
for more than two years, is dying.
Michael Munkacsy was born near
Munkacs, Hungary, October 10, 1844. He
has been virtually dead to the world
since the paralytic shock which in the
latter part of 1893 compelled him to
abandon all hope of ever working- at
his easel again. At that time he was
at Godesburg. For months he sat
brooding, until in an excess of mad
ness he suddenly attacked and nearly
strangled his attendant and his phy
sician. He was immediately removed
to an insane asylum, from which, on
its becoming obvious that his mental
condition was hopeless, he was removed
to the retreat where he is now passing
away the prime of his life.
His parents were poor, and before he
was 7 years old he was left an orphan
and given over to the charge of an
uncle at Osaba, who seems to have
treated him very harshly. It happened
that in the same village his sister was
quartered with an aunt, and the small
boy lived between the two houses. The
youngster was afterward apprenticed
to a tradesman.
In his autobiography, "The Early
Recollections of Munkacsy," which ap
peared in the latter part of 1897, after
he had lost his reason, he tells with the
most charming simplicity of those days
of apprenticeship, of heating glue and
grinding cheap paint. At 14 he was a
qualified workman and was sent by his
uncle into the world, with five florins in
his pocket. For two years he lived in
the town of Arad. Then, his heaith
weakened by wretchedness and lack of
food, he was compelled to return to
his uncle's house. Here the sight of
engravings set him copying them, and
the taste returned to him like a passion.
One day his uncle, chancing to look
over his shoulder at a drawing, said:
"You might possibly become a painter."
Shortly after this he entered the
studio of a German named Fischer,
where he met Szamossy, a painter of
some talent, who gave him an invita
tion to enter his studio. He accepted,
but not having other means to pay for
his instruction, insisted on being a kind
of domestic servant and man of all
work in Szamossy's house. In his "Rec
ollecions" he says proudly: "I was a
good one."
After eighteen months he felt strong
enough to strike nut for himself, and an
a very limited purchase of colors he be
gan to paint compositions with life
sized figures. His autobiography ends
with that incident.
IN ADDITION TO
UNCLE SAM'S NAVY
Gunboat BaracoaTowed
to Santiago.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 23.â The
Navy Department is gratified to learn
that its representatives who have been
working for some time in the vicinity
of Santiago and Guantanamo have
succeeded in adding another vessel to
the American navy in the shape of the
gunboat Baracoa, which was reported
to have been towed into Santiago, as
Btated in the Associated Press Ills
patches from Santiago.
The Baracoa was one of the Spanish
gunboats sunk near Guantanamo. She
is a useful type of vessel and is larger
than the gunboats Sandoval and Al
varado, now at the Washington navy
yard.
The Baracoa is of steel, 114 feet nine
inches long, sixteen feet five inches
beam and 8 feet 2 inches draught.
Her displacement is 135 tons, and with

WOODMEN OF THE WORLD.
Changes Made in Their Constitution
and Laws.
MEMPHIS, Term., March 23.â The con
vention of the "Woodmen of the World,
which has been in session in Memphis
for nearly two weeks, will adjourn sine
die at the morning session to-morrow.
It was after 3 o'clock to-day when the
camp concluded the final work on the
constitution and laws as a whole. This
was the real end to the business of the
meeting. There were probably over a
hundred changes recommended by the
committee on Taws for the constitution,
but a very large majority of them were
rejected. Probably the. most important
change that was made at the session to
day was as to State camps. It was de
cided that hereafter in any State in
which there are 10,000 members the order
can have a conventional camp with its
own officers.
On December 31 of this year the con
tract with Head Consul Frost of Atlan
ta, under which he has charge of all the
organization work under the jurisdiction
of tbÂ« Southern Provisional Council, will
expire, and it will not be renewed. This
was decided to-day. It is claimed that
this will relieve the Southern camps of
what is considered a burden in the way
of conducting their business affairs.
THE MOUNT LOWE RAILWAY.
Some Bonds Thought to Be in the
Southern Pacific's Hands.
LOS ANGELES. March 23.â The sale of
the Mount Lowe Railway has brought to
light the fact that of the $500,000 in bonds
outstanding $100,000 are described as scat
tering. It is this fact, coupled with the
one that the Southern Pacific Railroad
posse?ses $25,000 of the bonds, that injects
an element ot mystery into the specula
tions concerning the future ownership of
the property. If these bonds have been
absorbed by the Southern Pacific a new
and unexpected element enters into the
sale on Tuesday next. It is positively
stated that the $125,000 in bonds have not
been deposited with capitalists, who have
been buying up all the holdings on the
market. Charles G. Singer, representing
the estate of H. M. Singer, has $115,500 of
Mount Lowe bonds, and Valentine Peyton
has the remainder of the $375 000 These
two interests are closely allied, but it is
declared positively that neither have any
affiliations with the Southern Pacific,

IDENTIFICATION
IS IMPOSSIBLE
Nine Charred Remains
From the Windsor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 23.â Nineteen
dead and thirty-four missing is the rec
ord so far for the Windsor Hotel fire
Friday last. One more body was found
to-day. This brings the list of unknown
dead to nine. The fragments were dug
up about twenty feet west of the annex
on the Forty-seventh street side, in a
part of the ruins where no other bodies
or bones have been found. The remains
consist simply of a portion of a spinal
column with some of the ribs attached,
a piece of the skull and some small
bones and charred flesh. The remains
were taken to the Morgue and num
bered "Body No. 9." '
Identification in this case, as in the
large majority of the other bodies at
the Morgue, will be impossible. It is
not likely that any of the bodies yet to
be found will be recognizable.
The work of clearing away the debris
proceeds slowly. The great mound of
debris in Fifth avenue seems to grow
larger each day, though it was said to
day that fifty carts were engaged in
hauling it away. Many persons called
at the Morgue and the East Fifty-first
street station to-day, the former in the
hope of identifying some of the bodies*,
and the latter, mostly women, to claim
lost articles to preserve as keepsakes
The search continues to reveal small
articles of personal property.
DISCUSSION" OF METHODS
EMPLOYED IN SCHOOLS
Some Most Interesting Subjects Con
sidered at the Session of the
Teachers' Institute.
SAN RAFAEL, March 23.â Discussion
of the methods employed In the Alameda |
public schools was resumed Jt to-day's '
f-ession of the Teachers' Instlute. Mis?
Kathryn Stone, Instructor T. L.. Heaton,
and Professor E. P. Cubberly of Stanford
University also enlivened the morning ses
sion by discoursing on various subjects of
Interest to the educational fraternity.
Miss Stone exemplified the methods em
ployed by her in teaching music to the
pupils of" the Alameda schools, while In
structor Heaton spoke on the theme of
daily programmes in rural schools and
school hygeine.
Professor Cubberly explained at length
I why some teachers fail. He said every
year the State gTants one-third a3 many
! certificates to teach as there are posi
-1 tions- In other words, that every three
'â  years enough certificates are issued to
'â  supply a teacher for every available po-
I sition in the State. In common with the
I other professions the supply is far great
er than the demand. This naturally
! causes discouragement and consequent
I failure.
In the afternoon the lecturer spoke on
. "The Social Aspects of Education," a sub
i ject in which all present took a keen in
terest.

LEON STRAUSS
HORSEWHIPPED
The Lash Applied by an
Insulted Domestic.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 23.â Leo-n Strauss,
the young attorney who was horse
whipped a few evenings ago by Lucinda
Small, a comely domestic, is rankled
over his humiliation, and proposes to
even up the score by prosecuting the
girl and her two male companions.
Strauss has always posed as a lady
killer, and more than once he has fig
ured in mild sensations.
When he insulted Miss Small, as she
alleges, the girl at once sought two gen
tlemen friends, William Miller and
George Martin. She demanded venge- j
ance and disclosed her plan of horse
whipping Strauss. She asked their aid.
Miller and Martin consented, and the
next evening the three waited for their
victim at the corner of Ninth and Ju
lian streets. Strauss came along about
10:30, and the two men caught him and
told him he must either submit to being
horsewhipped by Miss Small or take a
good licking at their hands.
Strauss was gallant even under these
circumstances, especially when he saw
that Miller and Martin meant business.
He removed his coat and hat and said
he was ready. Miss Small plied her
whip lightly at first, but, encouraged by
her male companions, she Increased her
welts. Her victim winced and groaned j
and pleaded for mercy. The whip broke,
however, and the young lawyer was
told to dress and go, with a warning j
to- behave toward young ladies in the ;
future. Strauss broke and ran for his j
home, which is in the vicinity, without
waiting to don his garments.
The story leaked out a few days ago.
Strauss is known to everybody, and he
is reaping great notoriety over the es
capade. Strauss denies the story as a
whole. He admits having trouble with
i Â». T lÃs Small, Miller and Martin, which
ended in a fight, but says he was not
horsewhipped by the girl. Now he pro
poses to have all three arrested for bat
tery, and the trial will probably bring
out some interesting details.

DESIRELLO IS
NOW REPENTANT
Sorry That He Killed an
Innocent Boy.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, March 23.âDis
trict Attorney Bullock to-day filed a
complaint against Fred Desirello.
charging him with the murder of
James Johnston. The complaint is
sworn to by Peter Johnston, the father
of the dead boy. Desirello was taken
before Justice of the Peace James Han
non this afternoon and arraigned.
Mr. Walker, one of the attorneys for
the defense, was present at the ar
raignment, the other attorney. E. F.
Fitzpatrick, being absent. The effect
of the nervous strain under which the
defendant has been laboring was no
ticeable as he appeared before the com
mitting magistrate to-day. Though
outwardly calm, yet, after the court
had been called to order and when he
was asked his name by the Justice,
there was a tremor in his voice which
he could not control. He gave his full
name as Frederick Ferdinand Wallace
Desirello.
After reading the complaint the Jus
tice informed him of his right to have
counsel in all stages of the proceed
ings, and inquired if he had as yet re
tained or consulted counsel, to which
he replied that he had procured the
services of Fitzpatrick & Walker.
It was suggested by the District At
torney that the preliminary examina
tion be held at as early a date as pos
sible, in view of the fact that a jury
would soon be called in the Superior
Court and an early trial could be pro
cured. The defendant desired to con
sult with his counsel before fixing the
time of hearing, but it was understood
that possibly it would be agreed to
hold the examination on Monday next.
Just what will be the defense cannot
now be learned, but from the defend
ant's version of the affair it would
seem to be accidental killing. It was
rumored here to-day that the defense
would be insanity. Desirello seems to
feel his position keenly and expresses
regret at the shooting.
ROTHSCHILDS WILL
NOT OPEN A BANK
NEW YORK, March 23.â A representa
tive of J. Pierpont Morgan & Co. to-day
characterized as absurd the dispatch from
San Francisco stating that the firm was
about to open a bank there, "We will not
dignify the report by, discussing it," said
he.
August Belmont & Co., who represent
the Messrs. Rothschilds, when asked
about the truth of the dispatch from San
Francisco to the effect that the house
was to establish a bank In that city
which was to handle large mining and su
gar interests, replied that the statement
was nonsense. The firm did not care to
have anything printed about .the matter
at present, but one of Its representatives
repeated the statement that the dispatch
was nothing but nonsense.
Charles Lanere of Wlnslow, Lanere &
Co. said he knew nothing about the re
ported bank, and it was Stated at the of
fices of Brown Bros. & Co. that John
Crosby Brown had gone to California,
but on pleasure only.
Building Trades Council.
At the meeting of the Building Trades
Council last night a letter was received
from R. P. Doolan. requesting the council
to appoint a committee to work in con
junction with the committee which has
in hand the exposition in 1901. It was
conceded that the workingmen should be
properly represented, so P. H. McCarthy,
E. J. Brandon and E. L. Malsbary were
appointed. They were instructed to
watch closely for the interests of organ
ized labor.
It was reported that non-union men are
working at the repapering and repainting

C. W. Doyle and William Page were ap

tory agreement had been entered into be
tween employers and employes, and the
men are now back at work.

UPHOLDS JUSTICE
CHAMBERS' STAND
While Investigations Continue,
However, the Samoan Dead
lock Is Not Broken.
WASHINGTON. March 23.â The Ger
man Embassador, Dr. yon Holleben,
called at the State Department to-day
to further confer with the officials con
cerning the Samoan situation. The
Berlin authorities have communicated
very freely on the subject within the
last few days, and as a result of ex
tended dispatches from the Berlin For-
eign Office, the Embassador has pre
sented a long note covering the latest
phases of the case. It is understood
that the German advices confirm the
arrival of Admiral Kautz and the con
voking by him of a meeting of all the
officials on the 11th lnst. But they do
not show what resulted from the meet
ing.
Ail their reports are silent thus far
on this point, but the German view is
evidently one of apprehension lest se
rious results may grow out of the meet-
Ing, in which event the German view is
that the responsibilities should be borne
by those bringing about the meeting.
Further than this, questions are aris
ing as to the extent of authority of the
British and American Consuls, acting
together, to do anything without the
irrence of Consul Rose of Ger
many. The German view evidently
holds that the Berlin treaty requires
the three Consuls to act unanimously,
and nut through a majority.
ther question is as to the right
of the naval commander to take any
political action. The Berlin treaty
would limit the rights of naval com
manders within very narrow limits in
their views, leaving them simply to
execute what the three consuls by
unanimous agreement determine upon.
These are the main points engaging
attention and in view of the questions

the point where he stands, he has felt
obliged to sustain the conclusions al

The German Government, as Is gath
ered from the Berlin advices, is dis
posed to stand firmly in support of its
representative, although it has been
intimated to it that by his retirement
it would facilitate a speedy adjust

is manifestly impossible for the Lnited
States to discredit its representative,
the Clvef Justice, or for the British
ernment to discredit Mr. Maxse, in
view of the weight of the testimony in
their favor, so that a practical deadlock
has been reached, bo far as this matter
of changing th^ representation of the
three powers at Apia is concerned.
Our Government knows nothing as

of the German citizens of Samoa
against Chambers. If the German Gov

it can under the treaty of Berlin, re

In view of the facts above stated, this

These conditions lead to the belief
that there is some danger of the re

in the present temper of the parties it
would not be surprising If this hap

believed that even in that event some
manner of modus vlvendi will be pro

WILL CLEAN UP
TWENTY MILLIONS
Riches in Sight for a
Syndicate.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» CalL
TACOMA. Wash., March 23.â The Mc-
Donald Bonanza Klondike Syndicate,
the new corporation formed In London
to work out six claims on Bonanza and
Skookum creeks formerly owned by
Alexander McDonald and Henry Fer
guson, is expected to make $20,000,000
profit during the next few years.
McDonald and Ferguson arrived here
to-night. They have purchased six
carloads of boilers, pumps and other
hydraulic machinery in London and
San Francisco. This plant will be
shipped to Skagway next week and
hurried over "White Pass and as far as
possible on the ice. It will reach Daw
son in May, and by June will be in op
eration. To facilitate the transportation
over the passes the entire plant has
been put up in packages weighing 200
to 250 pounds each. One part of the
machinery alone will do the work of
400 men.
Sixteen mechanics are being taken
along, headed by G. T. Coffee, a mining
engineer of California, who spent a part
of last summer at Dawson in the inter
ests of the London syndicate, which
was then a prospective purchaser o-f the
claims now to be worked. Steam pumps
will supply the force, and streams of
water will be directed with terrific force
against the frozen earth and gravel.
Twenty-four horses have been pur
chased to haul the machinery when
water transportation gives out. The
transportatic-n will be under the per
sonal supervision of Ferguson, while
McDonald will hurry in over the ice,
starting next week, to take charge of
his millions at the spring cleanups.
It will take several years to sluice out
the six claims transferred to the Lon
don corporation, which are believed to
be the richest ciaims in the Klondike
district. They are claims No. 1, 2, 3, <
and 8 on Skookum Gulch and claim No.
2 above on Bonanza Creek. The latter
claim was purchased about a year ago
by McDonald and Ferguson for $125,
--000. Within a month thereafter they
had taken out $135,000. Ferguson esti
mates this claim will produce $5,000,000.
Claims 1. 2 and 3 on Skookum are
scarcely less rich, and it is here that the
hydraulic machinery will first be placed
In operation. Wood is plentiful on
Skookum Gulch, and the only possible
trouble foreseen is that water may be
scarce at certain seasons. Flumes will
be built if necessary to supply this
need.
The McDonald Bonanza Klondike
Corporation is composed of some of
London's richest men, including Mr.
McKUlop, M. P., who is chairman of Its
Board of Directors. His son will ac
company Ferguson to the interior. Fer
guson went to London with the expec
tation of celling out his interests and
retiring from Klondike mining. The
syndicate refused, however, to accede
to his request, believing that his inti
mate knowledge of the Klondike coun
try' was indispensable to the successful
consummation of its plans. McDonald
and Ferguson left their wives In the
East. The former's bride will go to
Dawson In June via St. Michael, and
come out with her husband next fall.
McDonald has reports from his part
ners at Dawson dated late In January.
These state that the claims on Domin
ion Creek between the two discoveries
were turning out as well as the average
El Dorado claims. Two miles of Sul
phur Creek below discovery were also
proving rich. At that time no laymen
had thrown up their work. McDonald
believes the development of the Yukon
gold fields has scarcely begun.

THE SAN FBA^CTSCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1899.
RAINFALL CAUSES THE STREAMS TO RISE.
CHANNELS AND
SLOUGHS ARE
NOW SWELLING
Backwater Is Causing Some
Apprehension at Points in
San Joaquin County.
STOCKTON, March 23.â The copious
rainfall in this vicinity has been too
heavy for even the parched earth to
absorb. The dry fields have drunk their
fill, and now a vast volume of surface
water is swelling every channel and
slough. Thirty-six hours of incessant
rain and melting snow in the moun
tains combine to-night to make the
timid afraid that the water will leave
its natural channels before daybreak.
There is no question but that low
points will be inundated before the
water passes, but the streams may
take water away before any serious
loss falls on the people in threatened
districts.
The San Joaquin River at the mouth
of the channel is fully four feet below
high water mark. As Stockton flootis
have always come from the backwater
at this point, the rapid rise in the
river gives just cause for apprehen
sion. It all depends on how much
snow water from the mountains is
coming down In the smaller streams,
the full effect of which will not be
known for twenty-four hours. What
may be termed local points, situated
at unprotected places on Mormon
Channel, are undoubtedly in for a wet
ting.
A message from Linden at 3:30 stated
that Mormon Channel was bank full
at that place, and that if it rained any
during the night, the water would be
running through the streets by morn
ing. At the same hour the Lnion
Transportation Company telephoned
that President Gillis' ranch, three
miles east of town, on Mormon Chan
nel, was under water. The slough
was overflowing its bank at that point.
The San Joaquin is rising at the rate
of about one and a quarter inches an
hour, but Mormon and Miner chan
nels 'are doubling that record.
From Peters comes word that the
water is almost on the Southern Pa
cific railroad track, and that It ex
tends as far as Holden. Some of It is
surface water, accumulating from the
recent rain, and the rest came down
from the foothills.
\ telephone message from Lockeford
stated that the levees were s^U intact
along the reclaimed lands of the Moke
lumne River, but that the river is ris
ing and men are out guarding the em
bankments. The danger from an over
flow is not so much from precipitation
In the valley as from the warm rain
in the mountains, wnlch results in
sending down snow water at a time
when streams are already full.
Late this afternoon a portion of the
city in the vicinity of the Valley road
roundhouse was flooded. All of the
low places south of Mormon Channel
and west of California street were un
der water. Fifty acres immediately
around the roundhouse is - covered with
water one foot deep. At 3 o'clock this
afternoon the asylum gauge registered
as follows: For the storm. 1.9 inches,
for the month. 5.13; for the season,
11.76, as against 5.49 for last year.

SACRAMENTO. March 23.-The bacra
mento Valley is still enjoying a *â¢ kin S
rain A heavy, warm rain is falling n
th* "mountains, and unless there should
come a freeze in the hills to check the
flow of water the snow will melt and send
down floodwaters. Farmers on the low
lands are already complaining of too
much water. During the twenty-four

occasional showers have fahen and sine?
nightfall none to speak of. The river is
rising and at dark stood twenty-one feet,
and If the storm ceases is not likely to
rise higher, as the American River will
soon run down. If the Sacramento River
â¢should rise to twenty-four feet at this
city wWch ie many feet below the leveo
top ' it will begin to run over the near
casement, 3000 feet long, recently con
structed at the Herschey break, eighteen
miles above this city, which will imme
diately relieve the river below that point
This county now has an ample rainfall
for all Its needs and a late spring shower
or two will insure bounteous crops. The
rain in the foothills has been heavy dur
ing the day.
Part of Gilroy Flooded.
GILROY. March 23â Twice in less than
twenty-four hours the I'vas Crf^k has
overflowed its banks and flooded the low
er portion of Gtlroy from Seventh street
south. At 7:30 o'clock last evening the
first overflow occurred, and again at 3
o'clock this afternoon. The rainfall up
to 8 o'clock this morning amounted to 3.04
inches for the twenty-four hours, which
is the heaviest on record, making a total
of 15 85 inches for the season. Rain has
fallen steadily all day. and the water
seems Increasing In volume instead of
diminishing. All the streams are over
flowing their banks. No damage has yet
been reported. The waters of the Llagas?
and the sloughs running into it have over
flowed, flooding the northeastern portion
of the town and the Martin field.
Chinese Are Alarmed.
SANTA CRI'Z. March 23.â The railroad
bridge near the mouth of the river has
been moved three inches from the foun
dation through a pile of logs lodged
against the pieces. It is doubtful if
broad-gauge trains will be able to cross
lit to-morrow. The river Is still rising.
i The inhabitants of Chinatown are
' alarmed, fearing the water will enter
! their houses. If the storm keeps up ehc h -
! natnwn will be under water. The rainfall
at FeUon for the storm is 6.79 inches. The
rain fell in torrents at Boulder Creek to
' day.
Outlook Never Brighter.
PETALUMA, March 23.â Rain has been
falling incessantly here for the last five

Streams are higher than for years. The
marsh below this city as far as the eye

STREAMS RISE
AND TRAFFIC
IS DELAYED
Small Floods in Santa Cruz
Countyâ Several Bridges
Washed Away.
SANTA CRUZ, March 23.â The storm
continues without interruption, and the
precipitation for to-day has been over
two inches. The rise in the river has
been steady, and portions of the town
have been flooded and are under water.
Bridges over the San Lorenzo have
been crowded with people, who go to
witness the raging torrent. Men are
there also to spear driftwood as it
comes down stream. There seems to be
no end to the driftwood. Immense trees
with roots come down the stream, lum
ber from barns, chicken houses, etc.,
which are broken in the swift stream.
Timbers from washed-out bridges also
float to the ocean.
The Seabright and Twin. Lake
beaches for over a mile are black with
logs, lumber and drift and crowds of
men are gathering it by cords. Drift
wood and logs lodge against the rail
road bridge at the mouth of the river
and a gang of men have been engaged
the entire day in getting them loose, as
it was feared a portion of the bridge
might be carried away.
Basements of houses and yards on
Front street and the lower part of Pa
cific avenue are under water from the
river. Houses and the Italian Hotel
on the island are entirely surrounded
by water and exit is only by boat.
Travel over the narrow-gauge road
has been suspended. Trains left with
men to clear the slides this morning.
About a dozen slides occurred on this
road between this city and Laurel and
a washout at Eccles. Passenger, mail
and express traffic has been only over
the broad-gauge.
On the Loma Prieta branch of the
Southern Pacific two bridges have been
washed away and there is a heavy slide
on the road. The road at Loma Prieta
is washed out and there is a big Jam
*..f logs in the mill pond at this place.
The California Powder Works was
compelled to close down to-day for a
couple of days on account of high
water.
Hazel Brook, in Doyle's Gulch, ordi
narily a small stream, was a foatnlng
torrent, two bridges were washed away
and school had to be closed.
Soquel was two feet under water.
WATSONVILLE. March 23.â The Pa
laro experienced an old-time rain the
last two days and high water in all
the creeks and river is the result. It
has rained almost incessantly here for
the last fifteen hours, and with the
amount of water that has fallen since
Tuesday morning this section has re
ceived about 6.60 inches, making over
21 inches for the season. The approach
to the bridge at Corralitos is gone and
two bridges on the Green Valley Creek
and one at Willoughbys are washed out.
The approach to the new bridge across
the Salsipuerdes. near town, is
threatened. The railroad bridge across
the Pajaro River is also in danger. The
lower part of the valley is all flooded
and it will be some time before the land
can be in proper shape for planting
beets. The Pajaro River is steadily ris
ing and will reach its highest point
probably by to-morrow morning, pro
viding the rain does not continue At
the present time the water Is at the
foot of Main street and steadily rising,
owing to the water from the San Be
nito commencing to come down.
Narrow-Gauge Boad Blocked.
SAN JOSE, March 23.-The rain has
been falling all day, the heaviest fall be
ing in the mountains. Many of the
creeks have overflowed, and the lowlands
in the vicinity of Gilroy, in the southern
end of the valley, and Alviso and Mil-
Ditas T near the bay. are under water. In
the event of a heavy fall to-night over
flows near the town may be expected.
LaTe reports from Gilroy state that the
water is still rising, and that the lower
portion of the town from Seventh street
B Â°ThÂ£ naSl'auge trains to Santa Cruz
are not running, as a landslide near
Wrights station blocked the train which
left here this morning On board were
H E. Huntlngton Jr. and several friends,
who were obliged to return to San Jose.
Another slide is reported on the ocean
side of the road a mile and a half from
Felton. Traffic will probably be delayed
fO Thu O s m far tl^o- damage to speak of has
been done to the crops and incalculable
stood has been accomplished. Up to 8
v m to-day .60 of an inch for the twenty
four hours has fallen, making 5.07 inches
for March and 12.51 for the season
against. 5.53 for the corresponding period
of last year.
Creeks Are Overflowing.
VALLEJO. March 23.â A heavy rain has
been falling here during the past forty
eight hours, with every indication for a
continuation of the storm. The Green
Valley reservoir, the source of Vallejos
and Mare Island's water supply, now
contains over forty feet of water, which
is eaual to two years' supply. Several
creeks in this neighborhood have over
flown their banks, doing considerate
damage to the lowlands. The reservo r
at the source of Suisun's water supply is
overflowing, and it is feared great dam
age will result if the storm continues
much longer. The grain and fruit pros
pects throughout Solano were never more
encouraging.
Heavy Wheat Crop Promised.
FRESNO. March 23.â The rainfall here
for the past twenty-four hours has been
half an inch, which brings the total pre
cipitation for the season up to 5.91
inches. Since the present storm began
nearly two inches of rain has fallen. The
forecast to-night is for more rain to-mor
row and th* indications are good for
showers during the entire week. The
streams leading from the mountains are
full to overflowing and if the storm con
tinues Blight floods may occur. Indica
tions for a heavy wheat crop were never
better in this part of the valley.

VERY RAPIDLY
Levee System Is in Good Con
dition to Contend Against
High Water.
MARTSVILDE, March 23.â Forty-two
hours of continuous rain has caused the
erstwhile placid Yuba to assume the
proportions of a torrent, and she is
sweeping past this city to-night with
unprecedented current, at the same
time gaining on the gauge at the rate
of four inches an hour. At S this even
ing the fourteen andone-half-foot mark
had been reached. It is thought the
seventeen-foot mark will be reached by
to-morrow morning. Heavy warm rains
in the mountains, which melted the
snow on all the ridges, is the cause of
the freshet. Marysviile and the levee
system was never in better condition
to contend against high water.
WOODLAND, March 23.â Later re
parts from Colusa and Tolo basin indi
cate conditions not so bad as antici
pated. But little water is running in
any creeks and sloughs that drain the
foothill country, and unless the storm
becomes heavier and continues for sev
eral days there is a strong hope that the
big tufe districts seeded may be kept
free of flood water and the crops be
saved. _____
Means Prosperity for Monterey.
MONTEREY. March 23.â A thorough
eauinoctlal storm is now visiting this en
tire section, the rain, which has fallen al
most constantly since midnight Tuesday
night, having completely soaked the
ground for an unusual depth. All the
rivers hereabouts have risen with Incred
ible rapidity, and if the rain continues
with Its present force there is danger of
some damage from overflow. The Salinas
River has during the past thirty-six hours
risen higher than It has been for five
years, and is now a rushing torrent,
carrying all before it. No danger to
bridges is apprehended as yet, however.
The Carmel River, which supplies Del
Monte, Pacific Grove and this city with
water, is also very high, and news comes
from the Sur and other surrounding dis
tricts that all the mountain streams have
filled to the greatest heights known in
J< The' whole community is In a state of
rejoicing, confidence is restored, and all
business interests having acquired a sta
billtv unknown for a year. Since the rains
began less than two weeks ago, credit
has become so much easier hereabouts
that merchants are restocking, ranchers
are giving large orders, both at home ana
to city houses, and a general business ac
tivity" is noticeable everywhere. This
rain means the prosperity of this section
of Monterey County beyond a doubt.
The rainfall of this immediate locality,
as measured from noon yesterday to noon
to-day, was: For Monterey. 1.49 inches;
for Del Monte. 1.47 inches; for Pacific
Grove. 1.51 inches.
Wliere Bain Is Expected.
LOS ANGELES, March 23.-The rain
storm predicted to-day did not material
ize. The conditions were favorable yester
day for a downpour, but the storm which
was centra! off the Northern California
coast passed northward again and South
ern California was slighted. The barome
ter is slowly falling, however, ajid rain is
expected at any moment. The sky is
heavily overcast.
Rainfall at Colusa.
COLUSA. March 23.â The rainfall for the
storm commencing Tuesday is 2.42 inches
and it is still raining. There is no appre
hension for the lower lands on Grand Isl
and. The rl\er at 4 p. m. was fourteen
feet and rising slowly.
In Santa Barbara County.
SANTA BARBARA, March 23.â 1t has
been raining heavily in the mountains
fnd in the interior of the county all day,
with mist and light showers on the coast.
The indications for a storm to-night are
good.
Plenty of Water Assured.
SUISI'N. March 23.â The recent rains
have dispelled fears previously antici
pated regarding inadequate water sup
plies for the towns of Solano County this
year Suisun is assured a good supply.
THE GREAT BAINSTOBM.
It Keeps Up Its Good Work and Is
Not Over Yet.
In the opinion of Weather Forecast Of
ficial Wlllson the rain which has been
continuous for the last forty-eight hours
is not done yet, and the State will con
tinue to receive the generous downpour
for some time to come.
"The barometer," he says, "has not
moved a point in sixteen hours, and I do
not look for a change in the weather.
The State has been generally visited,
with the exception of the southerly por
tion. Los Angeles has had but a trace
and San Diego has been overlooked en
tirely. Tlte San Joaquin and Sacramento
valleys and San Luis Obispo have had
plenty of rain, and I really cannot ac
count for the failure of this storm to
reach the south.
"On Tuesday the storm center was mov.
ing south, but yesterday it veered around
to the north and the chances for Los
Angeles and San Diego getting any rain
are very slim. The storm has moved
northeastward and is now central in Brit
ish Columbia. The pressure has not
changed appreciably and may be said to
be at a standstill. Rain has fallen over
California from Tehachapi to Point
Conception north. The temperature has
risen over the plateau region and has gen
erally remained stationary in the other
districts. Conditions are favorable for
rain in Northern California."
George W. McNear, the grain dealer,
is one of the hapniest men in the State.
In speaking of the* rainfall yesterday he
said: "This last rain is worth millions
to the State. From every' hand I hear
favorable reports. This will mean a
great boon to the farmers. The crops
after this drenching will be in splendid
condition, and we snail have the biggest
crop we have had in years. It means
much to California. The fruit, too, never
looked so well. All in all, we shall have
a most prosperous season in California."
HORSES LOST
BUT THE MEN
ARE RESCUED
Thrilling Incident of the
Storm in Marin County
Which Is Causing
a Flood.
SAN RAFAEL, March 23.â 1n at
tempting to cross a washout on the
county road a quarter of a mile be
low Point Reyes station with a four
horse team to-day, three men were
hurled into the waters of Paper Mill
Creek and were rescued in a drowning
condition. All the horses were drowned
and the wagon completely wrecked.
Joseph Ennis, foreman of William
Skinner's dairy ranch, was driving and
with him were two fellow employes
named Silva and Borvini. When they
came to the washout the latter tried
to dissuade Ennis from attempting to
cross, but in vain. The leaders crossed
safely, but both wheel horses lost their
footing, the wagon was overturned
and the team all rolled down a thirty
foot embankment to the seething
waters of the creek.
The stream ran so swiftly that no
aid could be given the horses. Ennis
stuck to the wagon and was finally
rescued with a ladder by Benjamin
Alcantra, a patrolman on the preserves
of the Country Club. Silva lost his
hold and was swept away, but Bor
vini swam after him. The rescuer,
handicapped by heavy shoes and cloth
ing, was twice dragged under by the
drowning man, but both finally
reached the bank more dead than
alive.
Many creeks are overflowing their
banks, and several washouts have oc
curred along the line of the North Pa
cific Coast Railroad. A work train, in
charge of James Kinney, was sent out
to make repairs this afternoon by Su
perintendent Shoemaker. At Lark
spur the whole of the lower part of
town is under water, and around
Tamalpais station there is an inland
bay. At Sausalito the side of a hill
has caved in and made the county
road almost impassible. If the storm
continues much longer traffic by road
throughout Marin County will have to
be suspended. Telegraph and tele
phone lines are down in many direc-
The total amount of rain for the
present storm registered by the gauge
of A P Hotaling & Co.'s Bank is 8.00
inches. Tuesday night over nine
inches fell at Lake Laguinitas. the
heaviest precipitation ever registered
there for a similar period. From noon
yesterday to 4 p. m. to-day the fall for
this city was 2.76 inches. The marshes
are still flooded, but this evening there
is a lull in the storm. The clouds are
still lowering and more rain is ex
pected. â .

PROFESSOR KOCH WILL
GO TO THE TROPICS
To Continue His Investigation as to
the Nature and Origin of
Malaria.
BERLIN, March 23.â Professor Koch,
the celebrated bacteriologist, who in ISS4,
at the head of the German Cholera Com
mission, visited Egypt and India and
there discovered the so-called "comma"
cholera baclllis. will start with an expe
dition next month for the tropics to con
tinue his investigation as to the nature
and origin of malaria. The Reichstag has
made a grant of 60,000 marks in aid of the
undertaking.
The expedition referred to in the fore
going dispatch is in line with the efforts
of Professor Koch to mitigate tropical fe- I
vers. When he returned last year from
a similar expedition to the German East
African coast he advanced the theory
that in the case of human beings mos- ,
quitoes played the part of communicating
malaria which ticks played in the cattle
disease known as "Texas fever." He had
reached the conclusion that where there :
are mosquitoes there is always malaria, I
and where there are no mosquitoes there
is no malaria. Moreover, he reported it !
was possible by microscopic examination
of the blood of a patient to discover from :
the nature of the microbes the exact stage ,
which the disease had reached.

This order of Secretary Alger has
i been issued to set at rest all question*
as to who is the supreme authority in
the War Department. It is an old con
troversy, dating back to the time when
â  Jefferson Davis was Secretary of War
and General Scott commanding general
of the army. The last time the matter
was brought prominently to the atten
-1 tion of the country was during the ad
ministration of President Arthur, when
Secretary Lincoln wrote a very caustic
! letter to Lieutenant General Sheridan,
stating that the staff corps of the War
Department, with the exception of the
adjutant general's and the inspector
general's corps, were under the direct
control and subject only to orders by
i the Secretary of War.
The order of Secretary Alger. will
hereafter include the chiefs of these
corps under the sole control of the Sec
retary. General Miles had held to the
construction based upon the letter of
Secretary Lincoln. The cause for the
issuance of the order was a recent or
der of General Miles to Lieutenant
! Colonel Garlington. acting chief of the
inspector general corps, during the ab
! sence of General Breckinridge. direct
ing Garlingtnn to visit certain points
in the West on an Inspection tour. The
' order of the Secretary did not refer to
; General Breckinridge's present duty in
! Cuba, as he is acting under orders is
| sued by Secretary Alger.

RUBICON WAS
PRESENTED WITH
THE HANDICAP
The Field Never Had
a Chance.
FERGUSON WAS IN BAD FORM
THREE FAVORITES SPLASHED
IN AT OAKLAND.
Sardine Captured the Waterhouse
Stake â Eddie Jones Won in a
Drive â Ellis Suspended for
His Ride on Topmast.
The downpour of rain seriously retard
ed Starter Ferguson In his work yester
day at Oakland track. His handling of
the barrfer in the six-furlong handicap
was proof positive of this assertion.
â¢'Danny" Lynch, who had "Gunner" Earp
appointed referee of the Fitzsimmons-
Sharkey fiasco, trains Rubicon. He, to
gether with his Arizona stable outfit, fell
into bad repute at Ingleside track some
two years ago, but is still countenanced
at Oakland. After a filibustering tour
through Colorado and Montana last sum
mer, resulting in destitution anil poverty,
Lynch arrived back in San Francisco
with fairly good health and Rubicon. He
appears to oe making the must of his
gaunt-looking string. The big chestnut
horse was backed by Lynch and his par
ty, they getting as good as 5 to 1 for their
money.
"Colonel Roosevelt" Hennessy had the
leg up, and took barrier and all with
him, winning easily at the wire by six
lengths from Rio Chico. Fred Forbes'
pair. Dr. Sheppard and Abuse, command
ed first call in the betting, but the start
ruined the chances of both. Before the
start Abuse was kicked by Rubicon,
fracturing a couple of his ribs. Rosor
monde, owned by J. Naglee Burke and
looking to have a royal chance, was vir
tually left at the post.
Throughout the day Ferguson displayed
bad form, nearly all of his starts be'ng
of the "serambled-egg" sort. The track
was very slushy ami much mud was liv
ing, and but three favorites managed to
earn brackets.
A race for 3-year-old fillies, over the
Futurity course, first to be decided, at
tracted but a field of four to the post.
Odd Eyes ruled favorite, but was easily
beaten by Charmante, the next in de
"pr Rowell's black gelding Con Dalton,
a 2 to 1 choice, took the first seven-fur
long run somewhat easily from Stromo.
Crossmolina was third.
The Waterhouse stake, at four and one
half furlongs, for 2-year-olds, went to
Sardine, ridden by Piggott. In a drive
Mountebank led Lomond out over a
length for the place. The winner, coupled
with St. Anthony, had a strong call in
the betting.
Backed down to pronounced favoritism,
the brown colt Eddie Jones finished first
for the mile and a sixteenth purse. Away
none too well, he took the lead in the
stretch, downing Morinel in a hard drive.
Casdale was sent to the post favorite
for the final seven-furlong selling affair,
and failed to secure a mark. El Salado
made all the running, and with nothing
to spare beat Campus a length.
Track Notes.
After the mile and a sixteenth race the
judges suspended Ellis for the poor
showing made by Topmast. Rey del
Tlerra, a pretty good horse himself and
second choice in the betting, finished be
hind Topmast, and it would -interest not
a few to lind out what became of his
speed.
Fifteen bookmakers laid prices. Frank
Eckert drew the choice position.
Myron E. McHenry, the noted reins
No. sâ Here's a good way to stop a
right swing and get even at the same
time. The left meets the descending arm
and the right is ripped up, underneath
the guard for the stomach. It requires a
vast amount of quickness and a poor
Judge of distance can't work it.
man, arrived in this city from Freeport,
111., on Wednesday evening. During the
illness of Tommy Keating last summer
McHenry held the ribbons over the lat
ter's record breakers.
Bullman will ride Sardonic In the Burns
handicap.

SULLIVAN WILL

THE BIG FIGHT
He Cannot Get Here

THE "KID" A FAVORITE STILL
McCOY BOXED CHOYNSKI A
DRAW IN THE EAST.
Both Pugilists Are in Fine Condition,
and Choynski Says That He
Will Force tbÂ»
Battle.
The managers of the affairs of McCoy
and Choynski held a second conference
last evening over the question of a ref
ree, as the man whom they had selected
on Wednesday evening, namely, John L.
Sullivan, has so far failed to answer the
telegram that was wired to him at Stock
ton.
Yesterday Manager Gibbs of the Na
tional Club received a message from
Stockton to the effect that Sullivan had
departed for Los Angeles on Tuesday, and
a second dispatch was forwarded to the
ex-champion at that place. An answer
was expected last evening, but up to a
late hour the news of the big fellow's
whereabouts was being hoped for. Doubt
less Sullivan and his company may be lo
cated for the time being at some town
on the line to the orange groves and the
message may not reach him until this
evening. In case a reply to the tempting
No. 7â Here is a blow that has troubled
a Jot of McCoy's opponents. He ducks a.
straight left and his left swings around
as stiff as a ramrod. The heel of his
glove and sometimes his forearm lands
on his opponent's neck or the point of hia
jaw, and it hurts.
offer that has been made to him by tha
National Club is not received by noon to
day, the managers of the pugilists will
meet and select some local man to reforea
the game. It is said that C. J. Kennedy,
who journeyed to this city with the pro
fessional bicyclists, may be mentioned
among those who are considered conver
sant with Queejisberry rules and Judges
of the game of hit and miss.
The betting on the fight was quite splr.
ited last evening considering the inclem
ency of the weather, choynski's
went up a peg. The pools closed last.
evening with McCoy a favorite, the ofl.u
being $10 to $6 50. Judging from conversa
tions between the men who gathered in
the pool rooms, that is, upon the relative
merits of the fighters, etc., Choynski haa
certainly a number of admirers ajid in all
probability he will give his opponent a.
close call in the betting this evening.
Joe is in first-class shape and weighs 175
pounds. He will have an advantage In
weight of about fifteen pounds over Mc-
Coy and a handicap of that kind is to be
taken into consideration when two clever
men face the music of the mits.
Choynski will make a stand-up flght.
provided his opponent will not break
ground too often. He does not propose t>>
chase the light-footed "Kid," neither doea
he propose to stand a la Sharkey and p.T
mlt his opponent to decorate his fac
reminders that there are others looking
for the long end of the long green. McCoy
has youth and speed on his side, but
Choynski has the experience that teaches
even a pugilist how to become perfect,
ami considering their respective ages the
difference of hve years is not a severa
handicap for Joe to carry.
McCoy was born October 7, 1873. in
Rush County, Indiana, and stands 5 feet
11 Inches. Choynski saw the first light
of day in San Francisco. He was born
on November 8, 1868. and stands 5 feet
l(Ha Inches. He boxed McCoy four rounds
in New York on March 21. 1896, which
ended in a draw. Choynski's last fight
of note was in this city on November 30,
1>97, when he fought Jeffries a twenty
round draw. Since that time he mot Gus
Ruhlin twice in Philadelphia, and each
bout of six rounds ended in a draw. Mc-
Coy has a lengthy record, but among the
many men he has conquered there are
only a few fighters of note. In 1897 he
met Tommy Ryan in a five-round contest,
which was declared a draw when the po
lice interferred. Dan Creedon was the
next best man to try conclusions with
"the KM " and Dan was defeated in fif
teen rounds. In IS9B he won a decision
over Gus "Ruhlln in a twenty-round con
test which took place in Syracuse, N. Y.
The ramaining fights he had in that year
were agninst such men as old Goddard,
W. J. Bladswell, W. J. Tierney, J. 1..
Bates. Van Huidenbrook, Dick Boling
and Tom Shea, none of whom are classed
above third grade. His last fighi waa
â with Tom Sharkey.
FAILED TO KEEP HIS PROMISE.
Warrant Out for the Arrest of John
Dean, Amateur Pugilist.
Norah Haley, a girl 18 years of age,
swore to a complaint in Judge Mogan's
court yesterday charging John Dean, an
amateur pugilist connected with the Sail
Francisco Athletic Club, with betrayal
under promise of marriage. Secretary
Kane of the Pacific Coast Society for the
Suppression of Vice and Officer Coleman
went with the warrant to George H.
Tay & Co.'s, on Battery street, where
Dean was employed, but found that ho
had not been there for several days.
The girl, while living with a family on
Brannan street, attempted to commit
suicide about six months ago by swal
lowing a dose of strychnine, and was con
fined Tn the City and County Hospital for
three months. About six weeks ago she
again contemplated suicide, and went to
Calvary Cemetery for that purpose. Sha
wrote a letter to Dean stating her inten
tion, but her courage failed her. She tore
up the letter, and the fragments were
found and led to her identification. Dean
Wcis so ashamed of himself that he prom
ised to marry her at that time, but he
has not yet fulfilled his promise.
TOD SLOAN RIDES
BERESFORD'S GRODNO
And Runs a Dead Heat in the Contest
for the Spring
Cup.
LONDON, March 23.â At the first day's
racing at the Liverpool spring meeting to
day Lord William Beresford's four-year
old chestnut colt Grodno, ridden by Tod
Sloan, and Lord Derby's five-year-old
chestnut gelding Crestfallen, ran a dead
heat for the Liverpool Spring Cup and
divided the stakes. Mr. Fairies four
year-old bay colt Chubb was third. Nino
horses ran.
The race was one of the most interest
ing events at Aintree for a long time past.
Tod Sloan on Grodno and Sam Loates on
Crestfallen both rode splendidly. Loatca
brought Crestfallen up in the last stride.
Grodno did not get away well, but led to
the first turn when the colt was headed
by Chubb. At the mile post Grodno re
sumed the lead, but at the stretch Chubb
was again in front. Grodno, however,
again pushed to the front and then Crest
falieii sprang forward and a most ex
citing finish was the result. Chubb being
only a short head behind the dead-heat
ers. This race is for a cup, value 800 sov
ereigns, 50 sovereigns in plate or the
whole in specie, at the option of the win
ner, a handicap for three-year-olds and
upward. The betting was 9 to 2 against
Grodno.
The Union Jack stakes were won by "W.
E. Oakley's chestnut colt Doddington.
Lord Dunravens bay colt Morgantee,
with Sloan in the saddle, was unplaced.
Seven horses ran over the course, a dis
tance of one mile. The betting was 5 to 1
against Morgantee.

TO COMMAND THE
EASTERN TROOPS
Now the Cuban Army Cannot Be
Disbanded Until the Assem
bly Surrenders the Rolls.
HAVANA, March 23, 9 p. m.â The ex- |
ecutive committee of the Cuban Military !
Assembly has appointed General Baro- i
lome Masso, former President of the i
Cuban Revolutionary Government,
lander-in-chief of the Cuban forces \
in the Orient, or eastern provinces.
The Assembly was in session this after
noon. The motion proposed yesterday
by nor Gomez for the reorganization
of the Cuban army was passed, but un
der existing conditions the action of the
Assembly in this respect is unimpor
tant.
A dispatch was read from the Veter
ans' Association of Santiago asking the
Assembly to restore General Maximo
Gomez to the post of commander- in
chief. From General Masso a telegram
was received recognizing on his part
the superior authority of the Assembly,
acknowledging it as a duty to sustain
the Assembly and lamenting the con
troversy with General Gomez.
Little has been said of late as to the
proposed trip to Washington of Senores
Vilialon, Hovia and Despaigne, the
committee appointed by the Assembly
on March 14 to lay before President
McKinley the resolution that aay
adopted on the motion of Genera San
guiiiy to the effect that the $3,000,000
offered by the United States would not
be sufficient, and that the United States
should help Cuba to obtain more by
way of a loan. Apparently the matter
has been dropped, but to-day Senor Ila
fael Portuor.do, chairman of the execu
tive committee, suggested that the com
mission should hand the resolution to
the Secretary of War. This course was
opposed by General Andrade, who said
General Alger would decline to recog
nize the Assembly officially and that
the commission would be snubbed.
Senor rtuondo-'s motion was left on
the table.
General Sanguilly suggested just be
fore adjournment that to-morrow's ses
sion be secret, and a motion to this ef
fect was passed, though some of the
members professed Ignorance erf the
reason for secrecy.
It is reported that a secret meeting
is in progress this evening at the house
of Senor Parragas, where the dissolu
tion motion to be argued on Saturday
is under preliminary consideration.
The Cuban generals, Diaz, Montea
gudo, larz, Betancourt and Peraza,
who held a secret meeting last night
after consulting their command with
reference to the course to be taken in
the controversy between Gomez and
the Assembly, reported to-day that
they had decided to accept the $3,000,
--000 for the soldiers, and also to help to
organize a new Cuban army of 10,000
men under the American administra
tion.
Meanwhile the Cuban muster rolls
are not yet in the hands of General
Brooke. " They were last seen by an
American officer in Guanabaeoa, when
they were in the : ss ssion of General
Ttoloff, the Cuban inspector general.
From his hands they probably passed
to the Military Assembly, and if the
Assembly still posseses them the pay
ment can be indefinitely delayed mere
ly by the withholding of the rolls from

Caii Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, March 23.
The State Department has been look-
Ing up the record of the . uneri- j
can citizen who was in Prague. Switz- ,
erland, making himself generally ob- i
noxious and offensive. Perjury com-
I before the American Consul is
igainst him in addition.
This man at first gave his name as
Anton Morescz, and claimed to reside
in Oakland. He said he had been a I
doctor in the Third California Volun- i
teers. and had fought at Santiago, Ban
Juan and elsewhere in Cuba, and that
be was now on a furlough. He pro- â 
duced naturalization papers issued to
Morescz, which appeared to be in !
r enough form with the exception
lie red ink. interlineations. He j
was equipped with military insignia,
decorations and American flags, but ;
notwithstanding all this he was sus- j
: of being an Unposter. He broke
. that his name was
Lowezynski; that he lived in San Fran- j
Cisco, and that he had borrowed the i
naturalization papers of Morescz, who j
lives in Oakland. Lowezynski was then ,
identified as a Pole, who had in times j
past been regarded as a dangerous
Russian anarchist.
ezynskl said that his wife lived
at 105 Stelner street, San Francisco, but
he had been absei t from her for a year.
He is yet in prison at Prague for per
jury, which is a very serious offense
Itzerland.
Lowezynski arrived in this city dur-
Ing the early part of last year, and
a hand-to-mouth existence. He
assumed the title of Count, and was
n to the habitues of a downtown
music hall by that high-sounding ap- j
pellation. He managed to be introduced ,
to Mrs H. L. Fabry, who was the j
widow of the well-known merchant of j
that name, who was accidentally
asphyxiated by gas In August, 1897. He
ed her to be possessed of a large
sum of money left her and her son by j
her first husband, and he paid ardent j
court and won her. Two weeks after !
their engagement he secured a marriage ;

cared for by those who found him he I

army, with permission to accept Ameri- '

case, the Americans probably would

semblj should not dissolve, it would
still hold the key to the situation, for
ral Gomez does not seem able to
â â  gel the rolls by persuasion, and his lack
:ial authority makes it impossible
for him to demand them. Therefore,
tion of the Assembly is awaited
w .'.;-. particular interest.
General Brooke has notified the de
partment 'â â  rs to hold them
selves in readii ome to Havana
to meet Secretary Alger. They are now
submitting reports as to the number
of Cuban officers holding positions un- j
der them. The city of Havana alone
shows nearly 400. Ttie other depart

dier tieneral Carpenter reports
that Cubans hold ninety-three out of
150 offices.
The decree establishing a Supreme
| Court for Cuba will be published to
iw. The curt, which is a pro
visional institution, necessarily is
based upon the former Cuban Court of
Last Appeal, which Madrid Intended t>
operate until the laws of the autonom*
egime had been thoroughly re
vised. It is adapted to the present
s of the island. It will consist of
one presiding judge and six associate
judges. The salary of the presiding
judge will be $8000 a year in American
gold. The law under which it is con
stituted requires the presence of five j
judges in rendering sentence in an or
i dlnary case and of all seven in the case
of a sentence to death or perpetual
punishment.
The court will have jurisdiction over j
criminal actions against even its pre- ;
; siding Judge, as well as all civil of
ncials and the military societies in the
provinces. It will decide questions of
jurisdiction between inferior tribunals,
and will generally supervise the admin
istration of justice in Cuban territory.
The direction and control of the court
is vested in the Presiding Judge, and
all its members must be Cubans or
swear to accept the new Government
of Cuban territory.
General Brooke has issued an order
forbidding the sale or possession of lot
tery and raffle tickets of any descrip
tion under penalty of confiscation and
fine.
A sentinel on the Toledo plantation
y. sterday ordered an armed Cuban
about entering to halt. The Cuban, ig
i noting the order, pushed on, and the
; corporal of the guard, who was sum
i moned by th- sentinel, arrested the cf
â¢â  and started to take him through
Marianao to < l^neral Lee's camp. While;
pasing a house in Marianao the two
Americans were accosted by eight Cu
bans who came out with rifles leveled, I
were told to release the prisoner.]
\s the Cubans had such an obvious ad
vantage th*- prisoner was released, but |
the Americans immediately reported j
the incident to General Lree. who sent;
Major Russell Harrison, the provost;
marshal to General Mayia Pvodriguez, ;
who instructed that the Cuban should j
be surrendei ed

the city of Mexico and Chicago, as his
practice became notorious, :ind he was
in danger of arrest.

Trouble Increased in the Los Angeles
Library.
LOS ANGELES. March 23.â The im
broglio of the library trustees, caused by
the refusal of Mrs. Harriot Wadleigh to
and refusing to step out after her

complicated by the. refusal of Editor C.
D. Willard, in an open letter, to accept
the position after unanimous election. At
the trustees' meeting to-day Mrs. Wad
leigh attempted to act as secretary, as is
; required, but the board refused to hear
ad Hie minutes or act in any form.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1899.
MINNIE ADAMS'
SHAMEFUL PAST
TOLD IN COURT
Preliminary Hearing
Begun.
WILSON GRAY'S TESTIMONY
POSITIVETHE WOMAN POISONED
THEIR CHZLD.
Two Important Points Brought Out
in the Evidence Given by Dr.
Zabala, the Autopsy
Surgeon.
Two points were brought out In the pre
liminary examination of Mrs. Minnie Ad
ams, charged with the poisoning of her
2-year-old child, yesterday afternoon that
appeared to cause the defense no small
degree of uneasiness.
The. examination was being conducted
before acting Police Judge Barry, sitting
; in Judge Mogan's court, and Wilson (Iray,
the father of the babe, had concluded his
testimony without, however, throwing
any material light on the tragedy that he
hns not already made public. Dr. Za
bala. autopsy physician for the Coroner,
was on the stand, and had described the
burns or scars on the child's body caused
by the carbolic acid. Under close ques
tioning by Prosecuting Attorney Carpen
ter Dr. Zabala testified that there were
no marks whatever on the. little one's
hands, although thi* mouth, cheeks, chin,
and even the neck were seared with the
fiery stuff.
This would tend to support tho theory
' of the prosecution that the child had been
| held and the ucid forced down its throat,
for it seems entirely probable that had he
taken the acid himself, when it began
; to burn his mouth h>Â» would Instinctively
j peek to wipe away the cause of the smart
! ing with his little hands.
The second point was developed by the
attorneys for the defense during the
cross-examination of Dr. Zabala, and as
soon as they discovered they had poked
into a mare's nest they dropped that line
of questioning, but the prosecution was
not slow to pick it up again on redirect
examination. Dr. Zabala had testified
that the baby's face was hurned on each
side, from the corners of the mouth to
the lobe of the ears, a uniform line mark
ing the course of the fluid.
The defense sought to show that these
might have been caused by the mother
wiping out the little sufferer's mouth with
a cloth or towel and.dra wing it across the
cheeks. Attorney Eruilfoyle pressed the
witness for an answer on that point and
the doctor expressed his opinion that the
marks would not have been so distinct
the entire length hail th> y been caused
in that manner. From their appearance
he was satisfied that the acid had flowed
from the mouth across the cheeks and
had not been brushed across with a cloth.
Attorney Gullfoyle appeared to be some
what taken aback at this and dismissed
th" witness, but Carpenter took him up
again and made, him describe the scars
more at length.
<;ray and Dr. Zabala were the only two
witnesses examined and the hearing w;is
continued until this afternoon. Mrs.
Adams was in court early. attendfnl by
her counsel, Messrs. CaldweU, Sweeney nnd
Guilfoyle. H*Â»r father and brothers, with
a few friends, were also present. Police
Sergeant Duke and Patrolman Graham
were seated by the Prosecuting Attorney.
ready to render what assistance lay in
their power.
Gray first took the stand and told of
his relations with the defendant. He said
the dead child was the fruit of those re
lations. They separated three or four
months ago, the woman taking the child
with her. After that she visited dray at
his room, 1147 Harrison street, about once
a week. He wanted to put the child in a
home, but she would not consent to it.
Once she told him the boy had got hold
of a bottle of carbolic acid and if he ever
did again she would let him drink it.
When she started to leave the room she
put her hand behind her and said: "You'd
better be careful how you talk or you'll
get your brains blown out." On March
13 Gray received a note from Mrs. Adams
paying the child was dead. He went out
to the house with the police officers and
accused the woman of causing its death.
Gray had an uncomfortable time of it
at the hands of the attorneys for the de
fense, but the court saved him from an
swering several embarrassing questions,
Buch as whether he had been arrested for
breaking up the furniture of their home,
and regarding his dismissal from the
army. He said he had given the child
clothing and toys amounting to less than
$5, but had not contributed to its support
'ince his separation from the mother, be
cause last July she took $2t>.~> of his money
and never gave any of it back.
Dr. Zabala next testified to the result of
the autopsy and said that death was un
doubtedly due to carbolic acid. He visited
the house when the child lav dead in the
absence of Coroner Hill and Prosecuting
Attorney Carpenter showed him the bottle
which contained the acid. The doctor
was of the opinion that It was empty, or
practically so, when he saw It at the
house ami the defense intimated pretty
strongly that it had been tampered with
by the police. They asked the Judge to
order it into the keeping of the court, but
as it had not been formally placed In evi
dence he refused to do so.
The hearing goes on again this after
noon.
MRS. ADAMS IS NOW
QUITE INDIFFERENT
Pays No Apparent Attention to Wil
son Gray's Damaging Testi
mony.
Listless, Indifferent _.nd altogether calm,
Mr 3. Minnie Adams sat In court beside
her attorneys, apparently unaware of the
damaging testimony being offered against
her by the man who is the father of her
dead boy. Seated well back in her chair,
ehe gazed straight ahead, never for one
moment letting her expressionless china
: blue eyes move in the direction of the
man who was trying so hard to swear
away her life. While he explained in de
! tail the circumstances of their "house
keeping." their final separation and her
subsequent visits in company with the
1 dead child to his Harrison-street room
not the flutter of an eyelash betrayed
' that she either heard what was said or
' caw the man who was delivering himself
| of his testimony, and all the while watch
ing the prisoner with the glued gaze of a
lynx.
The rude recital of the pathetic scene
i around the bier of the dead babe
| touched her not; the description of burns
I that disfigured the tiny face left her un
i moved, with shining eyes peering into
! the distance. It was only when Gray told
i how he stood beside the coffin of his
child and cried, "Minnie, you have done
this," that the fixed stare shifted and
the eyes of the woman accused of mur
dering her own child jumped madly, flash
ing furtively to either side and then re
lapsed with their long, fixed meaningless
stare.
There were no "outward trappings of
woe" about Mrs. Adams. No bit of bla^k

; loved and now mourns for. Gray

lie went back to the prison with a sigh
contentment and expressed her relief
the Interviewer.
I'm gbid to get back to the prison,"
said. "It was a long afternoon in

n, tired of being away from my peo-
I have no doubt but that my case
! will come out all right and that it will be
over in a few days, and I shall be glad,
for I am tired and want to go home."'
| The modicum of intelligence with which
! Mrs. Adams is endowed is just of a qual
ity sufficient to make a thinking animal
of her. She lacks the powr either to
love or to hate. She is "sorry her boy is
dead," but it is a sorrow that has its
being only from the tips of her lips. Gray
sine "has no use. for," and the greatest
depth of hatred she can cherish against
him she calmly sums up in her senten
tious description, "He's a pretty bad lot
tery ticket.
Only one bit of the testimony, seeming
ly unimportant, interested her, and it was
the squabble between her attorneys and
the prosecution over the bottle that had
contained the fatal dope of acid. "I've
been tricked." she declared, with a great
show of importance, "tricked about those
remaining drops of acid in the bottle.
There was none leftâ they put It in there,
nnd now they will be going to prove it
was diluted. I've been tricked, but I
have found it out and have told my at
torney about it."
That there is a possibility that she will
be held for murder Mrs. Adams will not
f.>r a moment entertain. "I never killed
my boy," she said, "and they must let
me go."
FIRE ENGINEERS FINED.

SAN JOAQUIN
VALLEY CROPS
WILL BE GREAT
Inspected by Railroad
Officials.
RAINSWERE MOST OPPORTUNE
WHEAT PRODUCT WILL BE THE
LARGEST FOR YEARS.
Ample Transportation Facilities Will
Be Provided by the Santa Fe
and Valley Rail
roads.
According to the present outlook, as
viewed by a party of officials of the Val
ley road who have just returned from a
tour of inspection through the San Joa
quin Valley, that section will afford the
largest amount of freight that has come
out of that valley in many a year.
On Tuesday last William A. Bissell, as
sistant traffic manager of the Santa Fe
FVPtPim, accompanied by Captain A. H.
Pay son, second vice president; John
Mosh. traffic manager, and William B.
Storey, engineer and general superin
tendent of the Valley road, left here for
a trip over the line, with the object of
studying conditions relative to the needs
of the valley in the way of passenger
and freight transportation facilities. At
Stockton the party was joined by General
Passenger Agent Byrne of the Southern
California and hy A. D. vSchindler, divi
sion superintendent of the Valley road,
and at Fresno by General Freight Agent
Chambers of the same line. The route
of travel was to Kakersfleld by way of
Viaalia, returning by way of Hanford.
It was found that the rains had done
wnndf-rs for the crops, though too late
in some instances to be of any great ben
efit. From reports made by expert grain
men along the line it was learned that
the wheat crop would average about 60
per cent. The area planted to grain this
year is greatly in excess of that of any
previous year, and a 60 per cent crop,
therefore, means that the yield will be
enormous. The damage to the apricot
and peach crops was found to be not as
great as first reported, yet the injury
will be considerable. All other deciduous
fruits will show excellent returns.
Traffic Manager Moss, when seen last
evening shortly after his return, was
much elated over the indications for a
prosperous season for the valley. He
Stated that while the rains had not been
as heavy in the upper portion of the val
ley, about Rakersiield. as was desired,
they had yet been sufficient to Insure
good crops', with late showers and no
blighting weather.
He thought there, would be plenty
freight for both transportation compa
nies in the valley. The rolling stock of
the A'alley road will be reinforced by
that of the Santa Fe, as by the time the
crops art- ready to be moved the track
arrangements between the Southern Pa
ine and the. Santa Fe. between Bakers
fleld and Mojave, will be in operation.
. ral Passenger Agent Byrne's trip
was mad" with the view to learning what
trains it would be necessary to put on
to run from Mojave in connection with
the service of the Valley road, so as to
make the through run to Stockton, and
later to San Francisco, with the great
est convenience to the patrons of the
The. road was found in excellent condi
tion despite the heavy rains, and the of
ficials are confident that sixty miles an
hour will be an easy achievement over it.

A CRUSH GREETS MELBA
IN THE ROLE OF JULIET
Picturesqueness and Vocal Grace
Mark the Personation.
BY ASHTON STEVENS.
MEL/BA sang; and as a matter of course it was an "on" night
with a swell crush. The Ellis season will be remembered for
two sorts of nights: The Melha nights and the others; for
one sort the Grand Opera-house has not been big enough, for
the other it has been too big. Such Is the fancy of the crowd. And yet
every opera produced has been given the best cast possible in the re
sources of the company: the singers have been selected for their special
accomplishment in certain parts, and wisely selected. Gadski's Alda is
a thing to treasure, so is De L,ussan's Carmen. But the passionate thou
sands have not congested on Gadski and De Lussan nights. It were a
different tale had Melba sung these parts, and sung them never so
badly. Not the opera but the singer has been the thing all through
the season. Fortunately Melba's endurance is as limited as her stock
of parts, and we have heard her only in the pieces that provide special
vent for her easy temperament and canary vocalization.
Last night it was the "Romeo and Juliet" of Gounod, a work
musically notable for increasing one's admiration for "Faust." There
is a great balcony scene in "Romeo and Juliet." full of voluptuous
"Fausf'-like music and incongruously parted in the middle by a second
rate male chorus; a Queen Mah song for the barytone; a concerted gem
that includes a trio and a quartet, and a dinky little waltz song, as good
as Arditti at his worst, for the soprano. Melba had to sing the waltz
twice last night. The audience gave it a perfect "Wahash" reception.
Mdba's Juliet, which is nw to up except fnr the nervous balcony
scene that she participated In on the fateful night at the California
Theater last season that ended ha a flre. Is a feat In sentimental anil
ornamental singing and pretty deportment. Tt is sweet to hear and gaze
upon. Tt makes not the slightest dent in your serious emotions, hut gives
you a deal of graceful entertainment. Tn fact, that is the schema of the
whole opera, and the less you think about William Shakespeare the
more you enjoy it. Perhaps one of our amiable young composers â De
Koven. for instance â will even up with France one of these days in an
opera on "Cyrano de Bergerae." I wonder that "Cyrano" isn't tuned up
already.
But, as T was saying. MÂ»!ha's Juliet is very picturesque and very
fragrant. She really looks amazingly young and comely in the part,
and she sings the music with the best voice and art that modern
vocnldom has to offer it. Once get your expectations on a level with
the opera â forget the subtle character, the enthralling life-likeness of
Melba'a Mlrrri in the "Boheme"â forget that modern music has come into
its own dramatic idiom, and that Shakespeare's Juliet is the most
thrilling woman in the literature of passion â in a word, accept her as
Mile. Capulet. nothing more, and you will pleasure in the graces of
Melba's performance.
Not the least remarkable feature of this season is the fact that
Melba has not had a single off night. Others in the company have had
their vocal ups and downs, hut Melha has been in perfect voice at
every appearance. Her first note last night gave us the sense of se
curity: and she continued the same to the end. singing the waltz with
Indescribable delicacy of tone and articulation, the balcony scene with
tender nuances in the "half voice." and the big duet with telline
sonority and a fair measure of excitement. In the concerted music in
the friar's cell her tone came out at its fullest, true, spotless, ringing.
and with never a blare to indicate that the actual limit was reached.
With the rest of the cast I can deal in milder terms. The pro
duction as a whole was not all that it might have been. The orches
tra, under Seppilli. was in good hands, but the choruses were not as
firm as usual, and one important part, Mercutio. was wretchedly sung
by De Vries. Of course illness is the only explanation, for we have
heard valuable singing from Dp Vries time and time again; hut what
ever the cause, a prominent part was ruined in all but the acting, and
even that was not up to its mark for vigor.
Bonnard ended up with a Romeo that stormed the whole house: but
as before he started badly. His voice was choky and evasive of the pitch
until the scene at the Friar's: there he got himself in control and after
that the notes rang round and honest and the honors were well balanced
between him and Melba. Boudouresque contributed a good Friar Law
rence Van Cauteren did another bit of unobtrusive character in the
nurse, Stehman was admirable as Capulet, and Mattfeld sang her lit
tle song rather neatly in the annexed role of Romeo's page.

RUSHING WORK ON THE GAP.
/â "â¢OLLIS P. HUNTINGTON has kept his recent
I promise to begin work on the gap in the Coast
road and to push it vigorously forward. It is
ted that large forces of men are now at work

Fare.
It seems from this that the Southern Pacific man
igers have at last awakened to a sense of the situa
:iu:i. The whistle of the locomotives on the Valley
Road carrying competition down the whole length
j\ the San Joaquin has awakened the old monopoly
- 'umbers and turned the attention of Mr.
Fiuntington from railroads in South Africa to those
n California.
By the connection of the Valley Road with the
: Fc system the competition established in the
s.an Joaquin has been extended across the continent,
ft is clearly high time for the Southern Pacific to do
something in California besides politics. Hence the
â¢udden determination of the company to fulfill the
promise made â  to the men who gave rights
31 way for the closing of the gap.
It is shown by these results that the promoters ot
:he Valley Road were not only enterprising them
selves, but were the cause of enterprise in others.
They not only broke the monopoly of the Southern
Pacific, but they broke its stagnation. They induced
activity in other departments of the company than

seemingly given orders for his men to "get a move
in" all along the line.

ThjE SIGNATURE LAW.
THE bill passed by the late Legislature requiring
the signature oi the writer to a specified class of
news, local or editorial matter, printed and pub
lished in a newspaper has become a law in due form,
; and will take effect at the expiration of thirty days
! from the 2ist inst.
This law provides that: "Every article, statement or
editorial contained in any newspaper or other printed
publication printed or published in this State, which
by writing or printing tends to blacken the memory
of one who is dead, or to impeach the honesty, in
tegrity, virtue or reputation, or publish the natural or
aileged defects of one who is alive, and thereby ex
pose him or her to public hatred, contempt or ridi
cule, must be supplemented by the true name of the
writer of such article, statement or editorial, signed
or printed at the end thereof." The penalty clause
provides that for failure to so print the signature of
the writer $iooo shall be forfeited by the owner, pub
lisher or proprietor, in a civil action by and in the
name of any person who may bring action therefor,
one-half to go to the State and the other half to the
plaintiff in such action.
The passage of such a law has been from time to
time agitated in this State for twenty-five years. It
presents a very interesting question, and it is well that
the Legislature has opened the way for its decision by
the courts.
The expansive nature of the law is very striking.
Its shelter is thrown over the memory of the dead of
i every age and country. Under it action would lie
; against a newspaper for saying, unsignatured. anything
j against the character of Nero, Caligula, Suwarrow,
; Alva, Benedict Arnold. Hyder All, Wirtz of j
I Andersonville prison, Wilkes Booth, Guiteau, Jesse I
! James, Sontag or Durrant. It also protects the liv- i
ing, from Chris Evans to Mrs. Botkin, to say nothing
of a different class of living people whose offenses
cannot be mentioned nor described without impeach
ment of their character.
To illustrate its effects: The Call of yesterday con
! tsined eighteen articles, of usual and ordinary news-
I paper matter, which fall under the provisions of the
law. Not one of them was libelous, nor malicious in
I intent. To comply with the law will make a news- !
paper page look like a hotel register or a subscription
list to a charity ball.
Various arguments have been made for such a law.
i Among these are that it constructs an individual
reputation for men employed to write on newspapers;
that it will build up a school of writers, like a special
1 school in art; that it will elevate the character of the
' press, and that it will protect personal privacy from
: intrusion and publicity.
It will do none of these things. To compel a writer
â  to sign his name only to matter blackening the mem
ory of the dead or impeaching the living, within the
comprehensive meaning of this law, is not to enhance
his reputation or give value to his individuality.
; Surely it is a far-fetched argument that a writer who
i does not sign his article laudatory of the dead and
i living is elevated in his profession by this law. In his
daily work every newspaper man. who holds the mir
ror of this busy, blundering, hurrying world up to
! nature, has occasion to use the memory of the dead
!as a good example, or bad, to the living. He rebukes
vice and holds the vicious up to hatred, contempt
and ridicule, as they deserve, and he seeks out the
| good among men, for the newspaper must truthfully
reflect it all.
The professional newspaper men, from reporters to
1 editorial writers, produce something to sell, and it is
bought by the owner of the newspaper. It then
: ct-ases to be their property, and is his property. As
well might the Legislature demand that a farmer shall !
i put his name on every potato and cabbage-head he
sends to market to protect his individuality.
The profession of journalism will be injured by this
law. A professional writer enters the service of a
newspaper to find a sale for his command of lan
guage. his genius in composition, his knowledge of
literature, politics, art, science, history and human
! character. This knowledge he sells. The newspaper
owner buys it and arranges the use of it, just as a
| client buys the legal knowledge of a lawyer. A Demo
cratic paper buys the product of a journalist who is a ;
! Republican, and dictates that product in the form of
\ articles upholding Democratic principles and attack
â  ing Republican principles and candidates. Under this
; law every criticism of a candidate must be signed, and,
when signed, a Republican writer's work on a Demo
i ciatic paper loses all value to the paper, for it is not
i taken then as the opinion of the paper, but as the mere
j personal opinion of the writer. As there is no Demo
! cratic paper in San Francisco this law would make im
i possible the employment of any Democratic political j
, journalist here. There would be no market for his
work.
Similar laws have failed to elevate the character of
the press wherever tried. Indeed, that character is
1 merely a reflex of the character of the community in
which the paper gathers its material for news and cdi
; torial treatment.
Censorship of the press has never elevated its char
â¢â  acter. Granting that the control of publicity by a
newspaper is a power of great weight, it is also a
power useful to the owner only while used under ex
actly the same restraints that are upon the control of
publicity which arises in free speech. An individual
who abuses the right of free speech habitually loses
. his influence and suffers in his material welfare.
Another feature of this law which is peculiar and
peculiarly obnoxious is that any one may bring suit i
'â  and recover under it. An unsigned reference to !
i Judas or Ananias is. ipso facto, a cause of action, and j
only the lack of signature need be proved to compel j
I a judgment and put $500 in the pocket of the plaintiff,
'a ho takes on the character of an informer. Since the
: days of Titus Oates and Jeffreys no such opening has j
been offered to human cupidity and malice.
Finally, it is not a law to punish offenses committed.
! It is a civil and not a criminal statute. Its penalty is j
i civil and not criminal, but it is collateral to the statute ',
of criminal libel. By signing his article the writer in- j
I curs no legal liability, but it is an admission by the
owner of the newspaper that he has published a
criminal libel, and so violates the legal principle that !
a man cannot be compelled to furnish testimony ;
1 against himself. So. too. it is statutory censorship of j
. the press. While Durrant was on trial a dramatized j
version of the incidents of his crime was prepared for
the stage by Mr. Daly. On application an injunction â¢
was issued against him by the Superior Court to re- j
1 strain the production of the play. In the proceeding i
to vacate the injunction the Supreme Court of the I
! State was reached, and there it was held that the Su- i
â¢ perior Court had exceeded its jurisdiction. The court '
i said (see Daly vs. Superior Court, 112 Cal. 96) : j
"A court, even of equity jurisdiction, has no jurisdic- I
! tion to enjoin the production on a theatrical stage of j
' a play which represents scenes or facts connected with ;
,a homicide, even while the person accused of the
i homicide is on trial for murder. The right to write,
apeak or publish cannot be abused until it is exer- ,
j cised: before it is exercised there can be no respon-
I sibility. The purpose of this provision of the con
j stitution was the abolishment of censorship, and for
THE SAN FEAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY. 3IABCH 24, 1899.
the courts to act as censors is directly violative of that
purpose."
That language stamps the law under discussion as
an attempt at statutory censorship. It requires some
thing prior to the exercise of the right to publish,
which right cannot be abused until it is exercised.
The constitution gives no shelter to automatic,
statutory censorship, which it denies to executive or
judicial censorship, and therefore this law is void.
BREAKING A TELEPHONE MONOPOLY.
WHILE telephone companies have been grasp
ing, greedy and aggressive in ' this country,
their practices have been mild in comparison
to the extortion which the National Telephone Com
pany has put upon the people of Great Britain. Lon
don in particular seems to have been looked upon by
the managers as a city given over to their looting, and
within its confined they have fixed so high the prices
for telephone service that none but Princes, mil
lionaires and Americans can afford to use it.
The result of the extortion has been a revolt on the
part of the British public. Acting in response to a
demand of the people for relief the Ministry has taken
up the subject, and a few days ago Parliament voted
the sum of 2,000,000 pounds sterling to equip the
Postoffice Department with a telephone system for
London, and at the same time authorized cities of
5C,000 inhabitants and upward throughout the king
dom to establish municipal telephones.
From a report of the debate on the bill given in a
recent issue of the London Chronicle we learn that the
defenders of the monopoly were unable to make an
effective reply to vhe charges brought against it, and
their only plea was that it would be unfair for the
Government to enter into competition with an enter
prise in which individuals have embarked so much of
their capital.
In moving the bill Mr. Hanbury said the National
Company had bought out all other telephone compa
nies and established a monopoly. It claimed a right
to go where it pleased or to refuse to go. It gave
service or refused service at will. It fixed prices to
suit itself, giving some customers low rates and prac
ticing extortion upon others. In short, it assumed all
sorts of privileges and repudiated all duty.
By reason of the possession of a monopoly the
company has fixed the standard price of telephone
service in London at Â£20 a year, while in the cities
of Continental Europe the price does not exceed
Â£10. and in Norway the price is less than Â£3. As a
consequence of the excessive charges Great Britain
is far behind other countries in the use of telephones.
In Norway and Sweden there is one telephone line
for every 145 inhabitants, in Germany one to every
140, in Switzerland one to every 170, while in Great
Britain there is but one to every 636 inhabitants.
In explaining the intentions of the Postoffice
Department with respect to the telephone service it
would put into operation Mr. H-anbury said: "We
do not propose to work on the system of subscription
only. We mean to popularize the system and throw
it open to every person, rich and poor alike." He
added that a yearly subscription in London would
probably not exceed Â£3.
Thus it will be seen that by trying to impose upon
London too far the British telephone monopoly has
led to its own overthrow. Just why the postoftice
should confine its operations to the metropolis and
leave other cities to establish municipal telephones is
not clear. The bill, however, seems to be generally
approved, and the Chronicle is sanguine that the
operation of the measure will soon be widened so as
to permit cities under 50,000 inhabitants to enjoy its
benefits.
THE EMBALMED ARMY BOARD.
THE Army Board of Inquiry into the matter of
roast beef, rotten beef and embalmed beef has
not succeeded in inspiring public confidence.
In fact, the body seems to be officially approaching
the conditions which militated against the popularity
of the meat. The members have not been treated with
chemicals, but their activity shows symptoms of
having been embalmed. It is true, however, that the
investigation has thus far led to an entertaining jun
ket, somewhat expensive, too, as will be found later.
It must appear to the unbiased observer that Gen
eral Miles has made out his case fully. He never
charged that all the beef was bad, and refutable wit
nesses have confirmed again and again the charges
he did prefer. They have sworn that beef was chemi
cally treated, but that even this had not arrested the
process of decay. They have sworn that tons of it
had to be buried, as, far from being fit to eat. the very
stench of it was sickening. Army men have testified
that there were maggots in some of the canned meat,
and that such of it as was free from this unpleasant
extra was stringy, disgusting to the eye, unpalatable
and innutritious. The men who tried to eat it were
sure to be attacked by illness, generally serious and
oftei fatal.
What more does the board want to find? What
jimpose can there be in further junketing? A great
and unforgivable crime has been committed. The
scoundrels have been exposed. The verdict should
contain the names of all the poison peddlers, and no
influence of wealth or station should permit any to es
cape a place on a lasting roll of dishonor. Poisoning
i? the most revolting method of murder, and employed
for the lust of gain it assumes its most hideous type.
General Miles cannot be termed a popular man, but
by his uncloaking a wholesale iniquity he has cer
tainly gained respect and adherents. As to the ap
parent hostility of the War Department, we hope it
is based on other ground. It is inconceivable that the
department should wish to shield evil-doers so grossly
anc 1 wantonly criminal, and for it to attempt to do so
would injure the administration in the judgment of
the nation, and the nation in the judgment of the
world.
The beef scandal has been the one blot on the
record of the war with Spain. The board can do much
to erase it. or it has power to render it indelible.
The first Kansas City woman who kissed Hobson
is not only a happy bride, but has made 416 other
spooney girls of that town to rejoice with hope and
purpose renewed. The men there had vowed never
to marry any girl who so far forgot herself as to
salute with her dewy lips the hero of the Merrimac.
Now the initial offender is on a wedding tour, the
spell is broken, the curse raised, and the promised
crop of old maids nipped in the bud.
Two mothers-in-law reclfritly united in an effort to
run the family affairs of a newly married couple, and
the speed -with which they ran them into the divorce
court argues much for the potency of the scheme.
Removal of the leper colony to Molokai would
probably be satisfactory to the patients. At least
Hawaii has always made a point of treating lepers to
the luxury of a roof under which to sleep.
While the police seem to have done well in nabbing
certain boy burglars, they have not nabbed the sec
ond-hand dealers who bought the booty and who
must have known it to have been stolen.
HOW MELBA SANG

When gilds the dewey hills.

And gentle is the brooklet's croon.
O'er shinins strand where Dryads

She sang as sing the birds at eve.

P The ballots showed how much substance there was in that theory. A
couple of votes were lifted from the Grant camp and one from General
Barnes by which supreme effort Burns managed to come out at the end of
the fight on a level with Grant. The "staked-out" vote, of which we have

Signing the articles
Of all the stupid legislation that has
ever cursed the State of California the
Morehouse signature bill takes the cake
â in fact, it commits burglary on the
bakery.
The law does not take effect for thirty
days, but as the signer desires to let
off some of the steam â not steam beer,
you typos! â of his indignation, this
statute from Agnews will be observed
for this occasion only.
In all the wild hurly-burly of a rich
and varied career 'from Oshkosh to
Shirt-Tail Canyon, the signer has never
met with a body of iaw-inakers so ut
terly unfitted for their work as the
crowd which evolved this misfit. Un
der it a man cannot say that a corn-fed
fairy in a vaudeville has more breadth
to her beam than brains in her smoke
stack, unless he signs his name to it.
And if some cross-eyed, antediluvian
coryphee cavorts across the stage like
a galloping cow in fly-time, the man
who calls attention to her cavorts must
sign his name. How would this do in
a paper:
Mile. Rita d' Bonfantl. having been in
formed by some humorist that she can
dance, has been trying it on the dog in
the interior towns. She appeared at the
Clunie last night, stripped for the fray.
Wearing a smile and a few corckscrew
ringlets she wafted down to the foot
lights like a masquerade of McKee Ran
kin and Bill Sykes. Built on the elliptical
plan, the audience wondered for a mo
ment whether she intended to do a con
tortion act. using her legs for a hoop. But
when she smiled and commenced to shake
her limbs all bets were declared off. The
impossible was about to happen. She was
going to dance. Angels and ministers of
grace defend us, hut what a dance! This
beef-ballasted fairy from Brobdingnag
pranced around the stage like John L
Sullivan with the cramps. She waltzed
like a hippopotamus and pirouetted like
an elephant. Surely never was such a
sight seen since Queen Liliuokalani led
the Honolulu hops.

EXPOUNDS THE PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY
A Large Assemblage Greeted the Revivalist
and Listened to His Glowing Words
of Exhortation and
Argument.
MOODY, the evangelist, opened his
crusade against sin at the First
Congregational Church yesterday
afternoon. Despite the inclement
"weather an assemblage that comfortably
filled the, edifice was present to greet the
famous expounder of Bible teachings and
to listen to what he had to say. It has
been ten years since Mr. Moody wa^j last
here, and his sojourn at this time will
"be brief, as the present revival, which
is under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A.
Lund the ministers of the city, will close
vr.ih the services to-morrow night. Dur
ing his st;iy here the evangelist will
preach twice a lay. at 2:30 o'clock in the
afternoons and at 7:30 o'clock nights. At
the opening services yesterday the music,
'which consisted of congregational sing
â intr. was led by Mr. D. B. Towner, who
Is Mr. Moody' 8 superintendent of music.
On the rostrum with the revivalist were
a number of the prominent ministers of
the city.
Mr. Moody opened the services by an
nouncing the hymn, "My Faith Looks Up
to Thee," after which Rev. William S.
Urmy. of the First Methodist Episcopal
Church, offered prayer. The congrega
tion sang "Jesus Lover of My Soul" and
the Rev. Joseph Re well, of the Mariner's
Church, offered a prayer. He was fol
lowed by Mr. Towner, who sang the
â well-known descriptive revival solo,
"Paul and Silas." At the conclusion of
the solo Mr. Moody delivered his sermon.
He did not choose any text, but talked
en .the "Component Qualities of Practi
cal Christianity."
The ideas he brought out were that it
was absolutely necessary, if one intends
; to be a truo and sincere Christian, that
he or she shall have faith, courage, en
thusiasm, perseverance and love. Mr.
Moody spoke for nearly three-quarters*
cf an hour, and during that time he held
the complete attention of his auditors.

: BERKELEY. March 23.â Thirty-one ]
' years ago California's State University |
was granted her charter. For thirty-one
' years she has held up the banner of |
â - learning for the native sons of the State, j
'. maintaining a strong independent exist- j
â¢ence the while, and stands now the pear â¢
of almost any college in the land. From :
'.'a' modest, humble beginning, with a bare ,
"\handful of students, her facilities of in- j
struction and her sphere oi influence have j
assumed proportions which bring her now j
...more than merely national recognition }
<.-.â¢ To-day was her birthday, the .thirty- !
: first anniversary of the time when the j
.State first sanctioned her corporate ex- ]
Â° jstence, and she celebrated the event with [
proper academic impressiveness.
It was a notable gathering of collegians ,
that assembled this morning in Harmon !
.Gymnasium, on the university campus..
On the platform sat the members of the j
Boar. of Regents with the professors and :
the associate professors of the faculty. I
In spite of a--dronching rain the building j
could hardly seat the 800 or more guests j
invited to be present. They included the j
prominent names in church and civil life
around the bay.
It was withal the most impressive I
charter day celebration possibly which
Berkeley has yet seen. Several things j
made it so. Although President Martin j
Kellogg, the venerable head of the j
â faculty, continues in office until July, his
"" resignation, tendered recently to the
â â â  Board of Regents, set to-day as the date
on which he preferred to lay down his :
..-work, and the audience made appropriate
'recognition of the fact. Added to this ,
'.was the presence of Dir. William Rainey j
-J-Larper, president of the University of i
â¢Chicago, and one of the most distinguish
â¢ed scholars of the East, who had come
ail the way to California for the purpose ;
d delK'ering the public address of the
, day. Both President Harper and Presi
dent Kellogg wore their doctor's gowns
in token of the academic significance of 1
the occasion.
Tne exercises opened with an oration by i
Harold S. Symme3 of the student body i
..on "Personal Influence in Higher Edu
cation," followed by a eulogy on the late !
â¢ Senator Justin S. â rzill by Hon. Timo- I
thy Guy * nelps. With a few brief words j
President Kellogg rose to i&Uoduo* him
old-time magnetism or force. He dem
ited his wonderful power to "size
up" his audience and to so shape his re-
I peal to them in the most
ble manner. Mr. Moody did not
one single word. Every sentence
he uttered carried With" it a new
and he invariably clinched each
â â Â»ith an illustration either from the
or real life. At times his phrase
wm humble, but it went home to
.f-arts of his listeners with an ap
-j and irr- - rce and power.
Mr. Moody opened his address by say
ing- that he presumed that those assem
bled were Christians and engaged in
stian work. Then he added that if
were not that they should be. and
that the sooner the pew and the- pulpit
g-ot tog-ether the more work would be ac
complished for God. Ho bail that what
hurch wanted was volunteers. Tha
army had to call for them and why
should not the church? Mr. Moody 'a first
idea was the necessity of â¢
faith. He declared that what the â 
tian wanted to believe was that God will
for his work and not thai
may use him. God wants a brave man
fi r his work and not a coward, and
:":re it is necessary tnat a Chr
have the courage of his convic
tions.

country in ten years there were
distinguished contemporary. Dr. Harper
acknowledged the compliment, and with
a few Introductory remarks began his
address on "Democracy and the Univer
sity." It combined the most modern |
views of the function of the university
In all its relations to democracy, thor- j
oughly comprehensive and far reaching in j
its scope, the fruit of a scholarship !
and penetration such as few speakers
put into public addresses.
President Harper said:
"I have chosen for my theme 'The Peo- .
rle; or, The University and Democracy.'
If humanity, in its' slow and tortuous
progress toward a higher civilization,
counts as its ally a power by which one .
by one the problems of that civilization
are resolved, humanity and this allied
power must in due time come to have
interests and aspirations which bind them
irrevocably together. On the one hand,
the university as an institution of the
Government, the university as the guide
of the people, the university as an ally
of humanity in Its struggle for advance
ment: and on the other, democracy, the >
highest ideal of human achievement; de
mocracy, the only possibility of a true
national life; democracy, the glorious and ,
golden sun lighting up the dark places of
all the world.
"The university has its origin in the
secular needs of the people. This secu- \
lar character has at times been overruled
when the church, as in the history of
English universities, or a denomination,
has en fit to place its hands ruthlessly
upon the university; but in such cases it
always happens that the university
ceases to exist, a church school taking
its place. That institution cannot become [
a university or remain one which to any
considerable extent is controlled by a j
power other than that which proceeds ;
from within Itself.
"For the fundamental needs of the uni
versity are self-government, freedom |
from "ecclesiastical control and the right
of free utterance. These alone give it the j
right to proclaim Itself an institution of
the people, an institution born of the dem
ocratic spirit.
"For the university is democratic. It is
a democratic institution In which definite j
and distinct effort is put forth to guide
the people in the decision of questions !
which from time to time confront them, :
and to furnish leaders in the different
callings of life; in which the people may
have full confidence; In which facilities
are furnished and encouragement af
forded to grapple with the great problems
of life and thought, in tie worlds of i
matter and of mind, with the sole pur ,

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1899.
Then he asked his audience if they did
not think that revivals were needed
"Some people claim that they don't see
the results of revivals because they don't
see any converts. In this world we gen
erally find what we are looking' for. There
is not a denomination In existence to-day
that did not originally spring from a re
vival."
Mr. Moody urged upon his auditors the
fact that one of the most needed charac
teristics in Christian work is persever
ance. "What you want to do is to keep
at work every day in the year. Fits and
starts will not accomplish anything-. The
secret of success is work."
In defending the attacks that have been
made upon him because of the fact that
his critics declare he always pro-aches the
same old thing, Mr. Moody .id:
"Of course I preach the same old Â£<"><=-
pel. I don't believe in a man changing hi 3
theology every thirty years. If this gos
pel was not 6000 years old I -would throw
it Into the Mississippi River. Why should
I change my gospel? Sin has not changed
men of the greatest genius, equipment of
the highf--- â¢;â¢! absolute freedom
from .r.trrference of any kind, civic or ec
clesiastical. The state has no more right
than the church to interfere wi'h the
search of truth, or with its promulgation,
when found.
"The university touches life, â 
phase of life, at every point. It enters
every field of thought to which the
human mind addresses itself. It has no
fixed abode far away from man; for it
â  i those who cannot come to
is shut in behind no lnfty battlement, for
no enemy which it would ward off.
Strangely enough. It vanquishes its
mies by inviting them Into close associa
tion with Itself. The un! f the
; md for the people, whether con
livldually or collectively.
"Democracy means in general the su
premacy of the people. Its essential prin
. ty and r ty to
. lie will. Hut the public will must
be an educated one. capable of intelligent
and â¢ .'lgment. Educati*:
the first and foremost pol
y. It i.s the foundation
- all else.
"The question I am asked to answer is
this: What relation does the university
racy? I beg the privilege
of drawing my answer from the terms of
Hebr< â  Now the university is
the prophetâ that is. the spokesman of
democracy. Democracy, if it continue,
.le the masses and maintain
their sympathy in interest. It has not
been unified, for it has hardly begun to
under-' I f. Ai a principle it seems
to be In the ascendency, but there are
Btlll great battles for it to fight. No won
der that it sometimes prows despondent.
No wonder that it la sometimes corrupt.
But yet It has a mission, surely, and. if so,
that mission In a word is righteousness.
"Democracy as an institution needs in
terpretation. Thf past must be interpre
ted In order that Its lessons may be
ivoided. The great
est danger Is that there shall be failure
â¢ntain the Closest connection with
the past The present itself must be
known and interpreted and the future
must be considered.
"Therefore I contend that the university
is the prophet of democracy; the agency
established by hi lelf to proclaim
democracy's principles. It is in the uni
â  ti the best opportunity is af
forded to investigate the movements of
the past and to present the facts and
principles involved before the public. The
university is the prophetic school out of
which come the teachers who are to lead
democracy in the true path. I' Ifl
rslty that must guide democracy
into the nev :" arts and literature
c. It is the university that
fights the battles of democracy, it? war
cry being 'Come, let us rt 'her.'
It is the university that in these latter
days goes forth with buoyant spirit to
comfort and clve help to those who are
downcast, takincr up its dwelling In the
midst of squalor and di< -t
university. I maintain, is the prophetic
interpreter of democracy, the prophet <>f
st in all it= vicissitudes; the pro
phet of her present in all its complexity;

gion I? a : art as a
mediator. It ia establish* I â 'â  the
,f mfn and nations ttit'i closer com
munion with the common soul of. all hu
manity: established to stand apart from
Institutions and at the samp time
to mingle closely with the constituent el
ements of the people; fstablished to in
troduce whoever will into all the mys
ot the past and present, whether j
I or still unsolved.
"It is also democracy's philosopher. The
situation in which democracy finds her
self to-day makes Serious demands for
â  thinking. By severe thinking I
mean the honest and unbiased considera
tion of all the facts which relate to de
mocracy. The prophet might be called
the preacher: the priest the teacher; but
the philosopher or sage is the thinker
and investigator.
"You ask what questions must be inves
tigated. I answer: Socialism Is threaten
ing to deprive democracy of some of h^r
be3t friends: it is doubtful whether de
mocracy is able to cope with the problem
of municipal government. How can it
govern the hundreds of millions of people
gradually coming under Its sway? What
is to be said of the relation of accumu
lated wealth to democratic institutions?
What shall democracy do with corpora
tions? How is it to do with its legislative
j? How can it place in ofli.e only
those who are fit to rule? How shall it
r^'SLore a fast decaying church to which
the masses of people are hostile?
"Education Is the basis of all democrat
ic progress; the problems of democracy
are therefore the problems of the univer
any in the past thirty years. It is the
same old sin that it always was."
The speaker then laid special force on
the fact that no means should he left
unused to bring: a man to Christ, or to a
place where he can hear the word of God
preached. His peroration was an appeal
to the people to cultivate a love for Chris
tian wi>rk. "Everybody must love their
work â  ' succeed." In addi
tion Mr. Moody said that human sympa

Mr. Moody's evening service was filled
Ion? before the evangelist opened the
meeting with the usual prayer and song
service. A part of the musical eervice
was a beautiful solo, entitled "When
Jesus Receives His Own."
Mr. Moody's discourse was an exhorta
tion to ministers and church members.
He has stated that his visit to the Pacific
Coast has been for the purpose of bring
ing a revival to the religious people, and
the noted revivalist last evening stuck
close to his text. To bring the matter
more forcibly home to his hearers, he
directed Mr. Towner to sing "Nothing but
Leaves."
"I don't believe," said Mr. Moody, 'that
it is the will of God that in the evening of
life any one will come saying, 'nothing
but leaves. ' .Some preachers are too gen
erous â¢with their sermons," continued the
evangelist in his home-thrusting way.
"Those sermons are so mild that they
never awake the people. Each member
of the congregation passes them over his
shoulder to the person behind him until
the sermon gets to the church door, and
then it goes out into the street to be lost.
It is only when the truth is driven into a
man that he will be awakened.
"There is another thing to have, and
that is loveâ the love of God. An unre
ger.erate man can't love. He hates. He
can't pray for his enemies because he
would rather kill them. The love of God
brings hope, and hope is the keystone of
a religious life. The man who has no
hope is a backslider.
"Have you liberty in your church? In
some churches an archangel couldn't
preach. There they are cold, cynical,
critical, and the miserable pastor never
gets on. The Holy Ghost must have a
harmonious atmosphere to live in. In
these places they never remember the
good things th* minister says, but
they alight on and pick to pieces the few
mistakes he may fall into. Suppose at
Pentecost James had said to John:
'Peter don't seem to be up to the mark.'
or the like. Do you think the tongues of
God's own fire would have come down to
them? Don't pick the preacher to
pieces.
"Be a power in the church, not a dead
number. Placarded in some empty build
ings suitable for shops or factories you
may see: 'To Rentâ or Without
Power.' It would be a practical idea to
ask people knocking at the door of the
church for membership, 'Do you want to
come in with power or without?' If
without, say: 'Stay out; too many of
that kind in already.' "
Mr. Moody said he would continue the
subject in the First Congregational
Church this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock,
and he was more anxious that his audi
tors should come and hear that discourse
than any other he has preached or may
preach in this city.

derson, who is generous to a degree, is
reluctant to begin criminal proceedings
against his agent, and it is more than
probable that he will charge up the few
thousand dollars missing to his experi
ence account.
The detectives who have been working
on the case say that aside from playing
the races Boody had no bad habits and
that his associates were not of the
vicious class. He fell Into the snare
which has ruined so many young men
with good prospects, and now he is pay
ing the penalty of disgrace and a dis
honored name. Mr. Anderson does not
know how much of his money has been
squandered in the pool boxes. He put im
plicit confidence in his agent, and when
he went to England a year ago he left a
large sum to be used in maintaining his
beautiful home at Ben Lomond and other
purposes. Boody neglected his duty and
went to the race-track. When Mr. An
derson asked for an accounting of his
stewardship he could not give one
! and evaded communication on the sub
ject. This led to his exposure and deten
< tion at the City Prison. Mr. Anderson
' will be governed by later developments
in deciding whether he will prosecute

OUR EXPORTS AND IMPORTS.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says
of the changing conditions .-. our exports and
Imports:
"The Government trade returns for February
axaiti show i. large excess of exports over Im
ports 'the surplus being 133.624,000. This la
$8 21$ 000 below the surplus of February. 1898,
and'it is desrvir.g of notice that the decrease
iÂ« c"ue to the extent of $7.155.000. to an Increase
In the import*. It would not be surprising If
the imports should continue to show an In
crease; for the prevailing national prosperity
may reasonably be expeetec to cause an in
crease 1" the consumption of foreign goods as
welf as domestic. For the first eight months
of the currer.t fiscal year the exports or mer
chandise exceeded the imports by $416.277.000,
which is $3,816,000 below the surplus for the
same period of 1597-8. The exports as against
Imports will be a matter of vast Importance in
the future, ar.d require to be watched closely
by Wall street operators. It must be remem
bered that much of this country's recent good
times has b^en largely derived from our pre
ponderance of exports over importsâlf we lose
that immense advantage, or even have it ma
terially diminished, it will be an adverse
factor."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. March - /ThÂ« stock market i
took on aii appearance of strength to-day and
the dealings of about three quarters of a mil

ment of the New Jersey Legislature was used
as a bull card among the coalers ra the ground

of 34. There was talk also of a lease on thÂ« j
Jersey Central to the Reading Company. Peo

journment of the Illinois Legislature and on â 
gossip of a possible consolidation with an elec
tric lighting company. ThÂ« dealings In Bur
lington were even in excess of thc*e in Sugar,
the late leader in point of activity, and a gain
of S points resulted In that railway security.
A sion interest was said to have existed in
Burlington ar.d the movement to-day resulted
from the covering of bear stop-loss orders. The !

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. March 23â Friends of wheat suf
fered a disappointment at th* start, for in
spite of considerable strergth exhibited on the
curb last right. May wheat opened Vs'g^c
lower at esges'-nc. The chief factor in the
weakness was tlvÂ» radical change in the char
acter of the advices from Liverpool. That
market at the opening, which resp.st-.ded only
feebly to yesterday's strength here, commenced
Immediately to break, closing wit a loss of
iÂ»c. Wltb that discouraging situation to start
or., confidence was undermined and liquida
tion became urgent, forcing May down to
63JJC. Reports from private sources of damage
to winter wheat came in from all quarters, j
There was a general feeling, however, that the !
increased breadth of fa',l seeding would amply
compensate f>~>r whatever damage has â >n
done. The Liverpool weakness was <ald tr> be
due to free offerings of wheat from Russia, i
At 6SÂ»sc the rr.ark-t was below the level of
put*, and lying against those privileges, to- i
gether with scattered coverir^? by shorts on I
account of fin Continental markets, starts!
aa upturn near the er.d. May closing at SSftQ
6S\C.
Corn weakened easily with wheat, but later
regained most of the loss. Small receipts
and a fair shipping demand were responsible
for the change of sentiment. May declined
He.
Oats were active and lower, with both the
buying and selling scattered. There was a
good cash demand from the East. May closed j
, HÂ©V4c lower.
Under the Influence of an improved export j
demand for lard, provisions ruled unexpected
ly steady, notwithstanding the decline in grain, j
The chief business was exchanging of May j
holdings for July or September at the current j
differences. Pork closed 74c higher and lard
and ribs 5c each.

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS AND RAISINS.
Prunes are now the leading variety, and the
' stock is said to be reduced to about 3"0 cars, j
! The New York Commercial says:
"The expected Improvement in Prunes has I
begun, a few sizes showing slight advances. ;
They are becoming scarce, though no two au- .
' thorities agree as to the number of cars now in
first hands. It -seems certain, however, that it
is much smaller than usual at this season, and
that practically everything in sight will be
I picked up within a month. The close concen-
I tration of stocks and the rapid movement Into
â  consumption preclude all possibility of a decline
â  In price. In fact, there is substantial agree
ment In the statement that as stock* clean up
and desirable qualities become more and more
difficult to obtain, prices will rise, and prob
ably continue high during the season, or until j
l the new crop comes in." 1

SMTJGGLING THAT FAILED.
Undersized Striped Bass Shipped in
Macaroni Boxes.
During the last two days there have
been a suspiclouly large number of mac
aror.i boxes shipped from the railroad
stations along the Contra Costa Bay
shores to commission houses in this city.
In every instance the boxes were nailed
tightly. At the same time there was a
corresponding falling off in the shipment
of the common fish boxes. Deputy Fish
Commissioner John Davis made an inves
tigation and found that the macaroni
box<_-3 contained striped bass of the pro
hibited sizes, under three pounds In
weight. The reason for shipping the fish
in thes* packages was to avoid having
them seized by the State officers, who
have been confiscating these small flsh
for the past two weeks.
Sine 0 the present storm has been on the
deep-sea fishers have been unable to sup
r'y the Ban Francisco and Oakland mar
kets and the scarcity has amounted to al
most a fish famine. The up-river fisher
men have taken advantage of this state
of affairs, and as the striped bass of the
Final! order has been the easiest to catch
and bring the best prices, they have done
all In their power to smuggle their
catches Into town. When to their disgust
they found that nearly ail of the bass
sent in had been seized by the deputies
of the Fish Commission other means of
getting their goods to market were re
eorted to and the Innocent looking mac
aroni boxes, of which the foreign-born
fishermen seem to have large numbers,
were tried. ~T :

PROVISIONS NOT FEASIBLE
INTENDED TO PREVENT OB
STRUCTION OF STREETS,
Supervisors Defer Action for One
Month to Permit Consultation
Between Merchants' Asso
ciation and Builders.
Representatives of the various building ,
associations of this city entered vigorous .
protest at a meeting of the Street Com
mittee of the Supervisors yesterday
against the proposed ordinance prohibit- |
ing them from placing material on the j
street or sidewalk near where a build- j
ing is In course of erection or repair, .
They took no middle ground in their ar
guments. They simply said it would
stop the erection of buildings or would ;
add to the price of the work.
President S. 11. Kent of the Builders'
Exchange was the first to protest against
the proposed legislation. He said the
ordinance was unnecessary, as those al
ready on the books covered all the vital
->olnts of the new law. If enforced by j
the police, who are charged with that
duty, they would relieve pedestrians of
the inconveniences to which they are at i
present subjected. He, in common with j
cither speakers, said the merchants of â 
the city were greater offenders in the !
occupancy of streets and sidewalks than j
are the builders. Goods are received and
delivered in large quantities in the busi
ness portion of the city, blocking the
Regarding the mixing of mortar, which
the new law would prohibit on the pub
lic streets, Mr. Wilson, a brickmason,
Â«aid it must be mixed where used owing i
to its ingredients. He said to frame j
such a law would be simply to put a stop i
to the erection of brick buildings He ,
was followed by Mr. Foley of the Build
ers' Association. He said it would work
a hardship on both property owner and
builders alike, although the additional ex- I
ponse entailed would fall on the former. j
The board, he thought, should permit a
reasonable use of the street. It was im- \
possible to work with brick and mortar
on the same lot in which a building is in
course of erection.
Mr. King, representing the Merchants
Association, said that body had studied
the ordinance and favored it. The evils
exist fid must be remedied, he said. He |
also said more complaints were lodged
with the Merchants' Association about |
obstructions at new buildings than on
any other matter.
It was finally decided to postpone ac
tion for one month. In the meantime
representatives of the Merchants' Asso- ;
ciation will confer with the builders and
some legislation will be suggested.

1 " â¦
THE foregoing verdict was' rendered
by a Coroner's Jury yesterday morn
ing and was approved by the Coroner,
At the time that old man Jones
died in the City Receiving Hospital it was
not known who the persons were who
had run over the deceased, and the de
tectives who had been detailed by the
Chief of Police to investigate the case
were informed exclusviely by The Call
last Wednesday morning that Jules C.
Gamage was the driver and that A. W.
Brown and W. B. Jennings, race track
habitues, were his companions.
The testimony taken yesterday before
the Coroner showed that Gamage "ifas
driving at a rate of speed so reckless that
the impression was made upon the minds
of the spectators that the horse was run
ning away. Carnage's friend Brown
swore that the animal was going "right
along," and that "right along" meant not
faster than five or six miles an hour. He
had driven the horse often and had found
him to be a very gentle animal, but at C
o'clock, when bound for the stable, the
horse was very anxious to gut home, and
it was very difficult to hold him in.
Jones stepped oft the curb Into the street
as they were approaching, and he start
ed to turn back, but Instead of doing so
he suddenly stepped forward and was
struck by the horse or the shaft, was
knocked down violently and the two
wheels on the right side of the buggy
passed over his chest. Gamage tried to
stop the horse, but could not do so until
he had gone about lifty yards, when
Brown and Jennings got out of the buggy
and Qamage drove back to the scene uf
Carnage testified that Jones stepped off
the curb and in front of the buggy wh.n
the horse's breast was not more than two
feet from him. After Jones fell the horse
jumped over him and the wheels passed
over the prostrate man. When Gamage
returned to the scene of the accident he
was denounced by Dr. Damkro^ger as the
perpetrator of an outrage. Gamage of
fered to surrender himself to a police
man but there was no policeman in
Bight He waited until the patrol wapon
took the injured man, and then he left
*Hn scene.
"Were you ever arrested for fast driv
ing?" asked Coroner Hill. ."â  â /Â£ â â .':";; y^r--
Gamage replied in the negative,, but
added that a policeman once caught his
horse by the bridle and tried to stop him,
and he cursed him. The policeman there
upon arrested him on a charge or using
vulgar language.
Lester H. Jacobs, a lawyer residing at
111 A Octavia street, testified that Just be
fore Jones was run down he was at t.he
intersection of Grant avenue and Market
street with O. K. Murray, and had just
stepped off the curb when he was pulled
back violently by McMurray just in time
to avoid being run over by the horse
driven by Gamage. The buggy proceed
ed on Its way up O'Farrell street within
a foot of the curb and ran over the de
ceased, who had just stepped off the side
walk. Neither Gamage nor any of his
companions gave any warning to the wit
ness when they almost run over him.
Alfred L. Black, another attomey-at
law was riding on the dummy of a street
car and saw the horse and buggy ap

Just as the hands of the clock ap

came, and following closely upon his
heels was Dana H. Thomas, a young
mining expert who has lately re
turned from Alaska, and in whose
hands was the lost pocketbook.
Mr. Browne's gratitude was
shown by his prompt offer of $500
to the finder of his wealth, but his
munificence was politely declined by
Thomas, who refused to accept any

A MOTHER'S LAST RESORT.
Mrs. Anna Freudenberg Has Her
Daughter Arrested on a Charge
of Vagrancy.
Mrs. Anna Freudenberg, 722 Valencia
street, swore to complaints in Judge Gra
ham's court yesterday for the arrest of
her daughter Martha and Martha's lover,
Fred Hovey, an Itinerant tea peddler, on
the charge of vagrancy. They were later
released on their own recognizance by
Judge Conlan.
A 1.. .lit a week ago Martha obtained a
search warrant for the recovery from
her mother of her clothing and other per
sonal effects, as she wanted to get mar
ried to Hovey against the wishes of her
parents. Nothing more was heard of the
search warrant case, as Mrs. Freuden
berg had nothing to surrender on the
warrant.
Instead of getting married. Martha and
her lover have been living in the Fulton
House on Larkin street, and Mrs. Freud
enberg determined that Hovey should
either marry her or break off his asso
ciatlon with her, hence the vagrancy
warrants. Mrs. Freudenberg alleges
that her daughter is compelled by fear
to remain with Hovey, but the girl says
she loves him and will not leave him.
They will appear before Judge Grahara
this morning.

INTERESTING
DEVELOPMENTS
IN NEALL CASE
Colonel Compton's
Strange Proposal.
ASKED FOR A RESIGNATION
ALSO DEMURRED TO RECEIVING
MONEY FOR SHORTAGE.
The Charges Have Been Preferred
and the Lieutenant Will Have
to Stand Trial for Two
Distinct Offenses.
Sine? the return of Lieutenant Neall to
the Presidio on Saturday last there have
been some interesting developments in the
case not generally known which tend to
show that Colonel Compton, whatever he
may do in the matter, is apparently be
ing actuated by some inexplicable motive.
It will be remembered that Lieutenant
Neall returned to the Presidio to stand
his trial for absence without leave and to
take the consequences. This was entirely
voluntary upon hi 3 part. The first thing
that he did on reporting to Colonel Comp
ton was to make good his shortage by
turning over the money. He was then
placed under arrest by Colonel Compton
and ordered to his quarters.
The following story, which was heard
at the Presidio yesterday, is interesting
and is confirmed by reliable sources.
Lieutenant Neall refused, however, to say
a word, while Colonel Compton's explana
tion could not be obtained, he having left
on Wednesday night on the Alameda for
Honolulu.
Early this week Colonel Compton sent
for Lieutenant Neall, so it is reported,
and read to him the charges which he
had preferred against him. The charges
specified that Lieutenant Neall had been
absent without leave and that he had
failed to make a proper account for funds
In his possession. Colonel Compton then
offered to Lieutenant Neall the prr
of tendering his resignation, and c
that he would forward it to the depart
ment commander with the charges he had
-r.-.i. So urgent was Colonel lomp-
\ nn a] matter of Lieutenant Neall
resigning that he even gave him a da>

the understanding was that f the officer
reÂ«ienf-l and his resignation was ac
cepted he would not be brought into court
to answer the charges preferred against
lieutenant Neall refused to tender his
relation He came back to stand his

trtif and he steadfastly adheres to his
P T r hi^ e however. is not all that is inter
esting n the case. When Lieutenant
Neall first reported to Colonel Compton
last Sunday morning and desired to turn
over the money to make good his short
age Colonel Compton most emphatically
demurred to his request. He did not de
sire the officer to turn over the money or
to receive it. Lieutenant Neall, however
insisted on makins his shortage good and

isted on mak >rtaÂ«e good, and
â¢mpton was forced to send for
the proper officers, to whom the money
was paid and from whom receipts for
the same were taken. Again, Colonel
Compton took care to impress upon Lieu
tenant Neall the fact that, although he
had made his shortage good, he need hope
for no leniency in the matter of charges
being preferred as far as they would be
relative to his failure to properly account
for public funds in his possession.
These facts are generally known and
are being quietly discussed at the Pre
sidio. Every one Is anxious to know ex

OLD SCHOOL BOARD
STILL UriDER FIRE
GRAND JURY HEARS WEBSTER'S
TESTIMONY.
Searching for Facts That Will Justify
j. Lengthy and Detailed
Investigation.
Superintendent of Schools R. V. Web
ster was before the Grand Jury yesterday
i afternoon for two hours for the purpose
of providing such enlightenment as he
' could regarding the misdeeds of the old
' School Board. The investigation insti
tuted by the last Grand Jury was gone
over in detail so far as the facts are
known to Mr. Webster, particularly with
reference to the deficit in the school fund
created by the old board. Mr. Webster
! told what he knew about the supplies pur
chased by the former board and about
which there has been so much scandal
during the past few months. Some of
I these supplies had been purchased on
requisitions and others were bought and
raid for without this necessary formality.
I In reference to certain demands which
I he refused to sign last November Super
intendent Webster said that hÂ«Â» acted as
he did because he believed the board had
no right nor the power to make expendit
ures beyond the provisions of th? one-
I twelfth act. This was particularly appli
cable in this case, said he, for the reason
that there was at the time not enough
money in the school fund to pay the sal-
I ary of teachers.
Up to this time the investigation by the
t present Grand Jury Into the affairs of the
' School Department has been general in
its nature, the object being to ascertain
if enough facts are obtainable to justify
an extended and detailed investigation.
The Grand Jury is investigating the
] case of H. Miller, an artist who claims to
1 have been robbed in the poker rooms of
I the Cafe Royal about four weeks ago.
! Miller was playing cards at the time the :
, alleged troublearose and there was some ;
' dispute over B pot containing $34. Miller
led the pot an.l took it. The other
rs objected and called in the man
of the place. Al Hornlein. Miller
c aims that Hornlein called In Special Po
liceman Shields, who held him while
Kornlein went through his pockets and
took all the money they contained, a sum
which, with the disputed pot money,
amounted to $44.
Miller caused the arrest of Hornlein and
Shields, but the charges against them
were dismissed in the Police Court. He is
now asking the Grand Jury to indict the
men.

NO CLEW TO
SCHROEDER'S
ASSAILANT
Police Are So Far in
the Dark.
VICTIM CANNOT HELP THEM
HE WAS TOO DRUNK TO RE
MEMBER ANYTHING.
The Wound Not So Serious as at First
Anticipated and He Will Soon
Come Around All Righ.*
Again.
Thr police kept up a diligent search y-s
--tf-rday for the man who stabbed Martin
Schroeder, the ex-convict, somewhere in
the neighborhood of Ninth and H<
streets Wednesday night, but were un
able to pet the slightest clew. Detectives
Crockett and Dillon were specially de
tailed on the case but could not get any
information to work upon.
Schroeder was very drunk Wednesday i
night. He had been drinking all day |
around the water front and spent con- '
siderable time in William Molloy's saloon, j
He went there to pay Molloy $1 50 he was j
owing him. When Molloy closed up his I
saloon, between 6 and 7 o'clock, Schroeder
and he went to Silk's saloon, corner of
Lafayette and Howard streets, but Molloy j
only remained a few minutes and left
Schroeder there. Schroeder was so drunk
that Silk refused to give, him any liquor.
Schroeder left the saloon and thought
he had gone two or three blocks and he
thinks that while crossing a street and
trying to keep out of the mud he had
stumbled against a man who stabbed him.
lie remembers receiving a blow on the
chest, but did not know that he had been
stubbed. He could not give any descrip
tion of the man as he was too drunk and
it was too dark.
Notwithstanding Schroedcr's statement
the detectives are inclined to believe that
he knows thf- man who stabbed him and
they want to know who it is and what
led to the stabbing. Sohroeder solemnly
told Sergeant Green, who has befriended
him on more than one occasion, that he
did not know the man, but the police are
unbelieving.
The wound is not nearly so serious as
at Brst anticipated and Schroeder was
able to sit up in bed yesterday and talk
freely. He will be removed to the City
and County Hospital to-day.

BRANOES EAGER
TO DECORATE HIS
CHILD'S GRAVE
The Accused Mur
derer Still Hopes.
JUROR MARSTON IS NOW ILL
â¢ARGUMENT IN THE TRIAL GOES
OVER UNTIL TUESDAY.
The Sick Juror Was Attacked With
Vertigo, Resulting From the
Heavy Strain of the Pro
tracted Trial.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
Broadway, March 23.
Argument in the Brandea murder case
went over this morning until next Tues
day, owing to the sudden and serious i 11â
nese of Juror Benjamin .S. Marston. Ac
cording to Dr. Juror Marston
t vertigo at his home this
morning, but the physician believes that
his patient will recover sufficiently to re-
Fume his duties as a juror by next Tues
day. Hem all hopes that the fate of
Brandos might be determined by the end
of this week are vain, a fact that ap
peared to h.iv-- a decidedly cheering effect
upon the accused murderer.
In the courtroom Brandes sighs and
heaves and rolls hie eyes about in their
â â =, and weeps and drops his head
back occasionally, as though gasping f or
hls last breath. If In the courtroom he
has been acting, he has carried out his
part very well. Behind the bars, in the
large corridor at the County Jail, he is
not the same man.
He sits about, his head covered with a
natty blue corduroy cap, and smokes his
ptpe, Bhuffl< s the cards in an 'â¢innocent
game" of poker for beans and laughs and
chats more merrily and unconcernedly
thn.n do most of his prison mates, who
are serving time for minor offenses.
If In the court he has the appearance
of one standing in the shadow of the gal
lows in the Jail corridor he not only ap
pears free from such horrid specters, but
actually expr< sses his confidence that the
twelve men who have listened to the har
rowing and blood-curdling details of the
alleged murder for the past six weeks
wiM give him his liberty.
"My attorneys. Messrs. Sawyer and
Bennett, have worked hard for me," said
the accused murderer this afternoon at
the County Jail, "and I do not know â 
how I am ever going to repay the com- j
lilimesnt. I cannot get out of here too:
for I wlil have plenty to attend to.
I want to bring some flowers to my girl's
grave and arrange to have a tombstone
the head. This is uppermost in my
mind. You have no idea how I loved that ,
girl I thought more of her than of any
of the rest of the family.
â â¢I ], mbt as to the outcome of
my case, and do not feel worried; only
I "ha- very well ever since I
have been in jail. 1 have lost twenty-rive
pounds and J can't live without work.
When I get out of here I'll never again
return to the watchman business. It cre
ates too many enemies for a man. I have
thing that I accumulated with
in the past eleven years on account or
this case. and, of course, I also provided
for my wife's defense."
But the accuse.! murderer stopped
short. He recollected his attorneys' ad
monition not to speak to any one. and
he returned to the long table in the cor
ridor and resumed the card game.
HE GETS THE DIVORCE,
SHE THE PROPERTY
HOW THE PRICE FAMILY SET
TLED THEIR TROUBLES.
A Potato-Masher Wielded by His
Angry Spouse Caused the Trouble
That Led to a Sepa
ration.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
â¢Â»s Broadway, March 23.
Mrs. Maggie E. Price snatched victory I
from the jaws of defeat in Judge Ells- !
â worth's court to-day. Her husband. M.
N. Price, sued her for a divorce some !
time ago. and this afternoon Judge Ells- j
worth granted him a decree. But this Is I
all he did get. To Mrs. Price was award- j
ed the home, dairy and chicken ranch in
North Oakland, besides other real estate
in this city.
At the trial some very Interesting de
tails of family history were related by \
the suing husband. It was brought out
that the parties were married in April, :
1887. In October, 1896, the wife deserted
plaintiff -by driving him from the house!
with a potato masher and without his
consent.
This domestic assault, it appeared, was
brought on by the fact that one day the
husband drove up to his home and asked
his wife to go out fur a drive. This j
proffered kimlnes was ignored, and in- j
etead Mrs Price accused her husband of ,
having taken other women out driving.
Price's protestations of his faithfulness
â were as the idle winds, but alter return
ing the buggy to the stable he renewed |
them and it" was then that the potato |
ma-her was wielded and Price was ban
ished. The suit for separation followed.
Mrs Price made no particular defense |
bo" far as fighting the divorce was con- ]
cemed, but she declared the property In- :
volved belonged to her. It developed that j
way back In their courting days Price
had given Mrs. Price money with Â£hlch
to build a house and sheds on the North .
Oakland property. She having therefore !
acqufred it before marrying it could not ,
be regarded as community property. Mrs.
Price also showed that she had man
aged the affairs of the household, twelve
cows and a dairy route, besides the chick
en ranch, and that the plaintiff had
P Wence S the n property was awarded to the
â wifo and the divorce to the husband.

Mr. Watkinson Smiles as He Thinks
of the Accommodating Nature
of the Heavy
Rains.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. March 23.
Thirty-six hours of continuous down
pour and still raining. Such is the record
of Oakland for the past day and a half.
When H. A. Pleitner, a real estate
dealer of Fruitvale, went to his office this
morning the office was gone. A little
search revealed the missing house in the
middle of Fruitvale Creek, and against it
a torrent of waters was beating. The con
tents had been washed out and deeds,
transcripts, maps and other parapherna
lia had landed In the estuary long before
Mr. Pleitner came down to business.
The buildingâ a substantial little struc
tureâwas built near the edge of the creek.
This creek has been dry so long that no
body anticipated any danger, but the
mighty torrent that started to rush down
the creek last night gradually washed the

During the recent campaign City Engi
neer Clement, who is a good engineer but
a poor politician and a worse orator, read
a. little speech in which he referred to the
streets of this city as "a monument of
engineering skill." Mr. Clement intended
of course to compliment the monument,
and not the engineer or the skill, but at
tins time this unfortunate remark is be
ing frequently quoted, especially in the
neighborhood of Twenty-seventh and San
Pablo, Sixth and Broadway and Fourth
avenue and East Eighteenth street, where
the â¢â¢monuments" are several feet out of
sight and only the skill remains.
At Fourth avenue and East Eighteenth
street the electric cars have not been
able to run for two days, as there are
B( . -ral feet of water on the track. At
Sixth and Broadway some wag waded
into the lake and stuck up a sign stating
that fishing lines could be hired on the
banks. The farmers are beginning to
think that there can be too much of a
good thing. .Like Macbeth they are cry
ing, "Hold, enough," but so far their cry
has been unheeded.
The luckiest man in town is J. H. T.
Watkinson, the general manager of the
Contra Costa Water Company. Two weeks
ago Mr. Watkinson, with a face two feet
long, went before the Council and told of
the drought and of the scarcity of water
in the San Leandro Lake, and argued that
all kinds of means would have to be de
vised to guarantee a sufficiency of fresh
water for Oakland for the next year. Mr.
Watkinson was even dramatic. He point
ed to the clear, dry sky and said, "Gen
tlemen, is there any evidence there that
we shall have any rain this year?" and
the Council said no and passed a water
rate which, it was hoped, would satisfy
the demands of the people and corporation
alike.
Now Mr. Watkinson is constantly tele
phoning to the San Leandro Lake and the
precaution has been taken to see that
the safety gates are In working order, so
that if it rains much longer the surplus
supply can be run off. Mr. Watkinson's
face to-day was about two feet broad
and the old Council is out of office.
Health Officer Dunn and City Bacter
iologist Ryfkogel were at the City Hall
to-day, computing how many microbes,
bacilli and other things had been washed
out of the sewers and off the sidewalks
by the rain. Their rows of figures
reached back and forth across the page
many times, and the experts said they
had not yet finished.
One of the greatest benefits done to the
farmers in the vicinity of Alvarado by
the storm is the driving out of the thou
sands of gophers which infest the region
in and about Alvarado. Every farmer
la Jubilant over the killing- of these pests,
for they do great damage to the beet
and grain fields. The gophers had en
croached more generally upon the bot
tom lands of late, owing to the recent
dry years.
The killing of the gophers Is due to the
flooding of the country. In some places
the water stands eight and ten Inches
deep and has even covered a .section of
the narrow gauge track 400 yards from
the station at Alvarado.

QUEER VERDICT
RENDERED IN
EPPERSON CASE
Killed by an Unknown
Man.
YET GILLIGAN SAYS HE DID IT
CORONER'S JURY SEEMS TO BE
A LITTLE MIXED.
Testimony That Indicated a General
Desire on the Part of Witnesses
to Keep From Being Con
nected With the Matter.
"We, the jury, do find that
John Epperson's death was
due to hemorrhage, the result
of a knife wound severing the
jugular, and we do further
find that said wound was in
flicted by some unknown per
son.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, March 23.
Notwithstanding that James J. Gilli
gan, charged with the murder of John
Epperson at the racetrack in Emeryville
last Tuesday, has retained Thomas Gar
rity as his attorney and has announced
that his plea will be self-defense, the
Coroner's Jury at the inquest to-night re
turned the verdict given above.
H. J. Duier or Dreyer, proprietor of the
notorious Office saloon at the Emeryville
racetrack, where the alleged murder was
committed, and who yesterday swore to
the complaint charging Gilllgan with mur
der, was the principal witness. His testi
mony was decidedly contradictory, and
from the first it was quite apparent that
he had come with his "little piece learned
by heart." Witness Duier tcstllied that
Epperson, the df<id man, had said to him
on Tuesday afternoon that he had no use
for Gilligan, and that he felt as though
he ought to kill him. The dead man had
said, "And I'm going to kill him."
"Just then." continued the witness,
"Gilllgan came in through the back door
and Epperson remarked, 'There he is
now.' Then they wrestled, but I went
out. When I stepped back into the saloon
Epperson was on top of Gilligan hitting
him with a knifo, while Gilllgan was un
derneath. I pulled thorn apart. I never
saw the knife in Gilligan's hand. When
I pulled Epperson up on his feet he told
me he thought his Jugular was cut and he
asked me to try and save him."
Duier identified the breadknife, a
sharp-pointed -weapon, as the one with
whicn the cutting had hoen done. It had
been lying on his Office saloon counter
just previous to the murder.
"Who told you that this knife was
used?" inquired Coroner Mehrmann of
witness.
"Why," replied Duier, "Gtlligan told me
himself that he had done it with that
knife."
J. D. Triplett testified that he was play-
Ing the piano just previous to the alleged
murder. Epperson had asked to play a
tune, when he turned to and fought with
CillliKan, but witness had suddenly
skipped at this juncture "because he did
not want to be mixed up."
Henry Pierce, who cle;tns up the Office
saloon," tt-.stitied next that he had just
stepped out when the row began and so
he did not see anything.
J. M. Leavltt, a horseman, was next
called and made the surprising statement
that at the time of the murder he rushed
In and took the knife away from one of
the men. but that be "<liil not know from
whom he took It," because it had grown
dark.
Richard Morrison Identified the dead
jockey's remains, and "Spike" Hennessy
testified that he "saw the fight only out-
Bide and afterward saw Epperson kick
Gilligan."
Drs. Hamlln and Milton testified to the
autopsy.
The jury then brought in the verdict,
and Coroner Mehrmann was loth to ap
prove the same. "This is a wrong ver
dict, gentlemen," said the Coroner, "and
I shall certainly charge Gilligan with
murder."
The verdict was finally approved on the
advice of District Attorney Allen, though
Kmll Lehnhardt, foreman of the jury,
suggested that the verdict be reconsid
ered It appears from what could be
gathered from jurors that they believed
It possible that Epperson had killed him
self by falling on the knife.
And all this notwithstanding Gilligan
only to-day reiterated the statement that
he "was forced to the deed by Epperson's
assault.

Mitchell Asks That She Be Bound
Over to Keep the
Peace.

Attorney Mitchell Is in fear of his lifo.
The lady who horsewhipped him and who
was convicted for the offense is now
awaiting sentence, and In the meantime
she has managed in some way or other
to create dire misgivings in the lawyer's
mind:
This morning Prosecuting Attorney
Abe P. Leach received the following let
ter:
Abe P. Leach, Esq. â Dear Sir: Tha woman
Gooby is being badly advised. She threatens
my life and Is very menacing. All my trans
actions will bear investigation and have been
done in the Superior Courts.
I desire no other than my rights and protec
tionâas a citizen and officer of the courts â
and knowinc that this disappointed woman Is
being influenced by prompters, and fearing her
attitude, I respectfully submit that she should
be strongly bound over to keep the peace. Re
spectfully. MITCHKLL.
Mrs. Gooby was before Judge Smith
this morning to be sentenced, but her at

BYROD WANTS
THE ESTATE
OF HIS WIFE
Deserted Her Many
Years Ago.
APPROVES OF A CONTRACT
SAYS HIS ATTORNEY ACTED IN
GOOD FAITH.
\
Was Disinherited by Mrs. Byrod,
Who Left the Savings of Her
Life to Various
Charities.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 23.
Frederick W. Byrod is not dissatisfied
with a contract he made some months
ago with Attorney Darwin DeGolia. The
troubles of Byrod have been the cause
of bringing him much notoriety, and a
few weeks ago statements were published
declaring that he was ajixlous not to
carry out a certain agreement that he
had made and which he hoped would re
sult in bringing him a large share oÂ£ a
disputed estate.
Attorney Frank D. Ryan of Sacramento,
In which city Mr. Byrod is detained, ap
peared before Judge Greene to-day and
stated that his suit to annul the con
tract made by Byrod with Attorney Dar
win DeGulia was inadvisedly brought
under a mistaken idea of the facts, and
Byrod now wished the court to dismiss
the case altogether. Some days ago
Judge Greene had held that Byrod's com
plaint was not good, and Byrod, having
failed to amend his complaint, his re
queÃt for dismissal of the action was
granted.
Behind this suit there Is an interesting
little romance. Mrs. Sarah G. Byrod was
a teacher in the Oaklana public schools
and died last November, leaving an
estate worth about $6000. By the terms
of her will the entire property was given
to charity, except a few minor bequests
to personal friends of the deceased, and
her husband Frederick W. Byrod, was
not mentioned in the will. Mr. anu Mrs.
Byrod have lived apart for many years
and Mrs. Byrod received no support from
her husband. He led a wandering, ir
regular life, and has held political posi
tions in both Oakland and Sacramento.
At the time of his wife's death he was
living in Sacramento, and when he be
came acquainted with the terms of her
will he decided to bring a contest for the
whole of the estate, affirming that he was
her only heir at law.
\;t. r making some inquiry' Byrod made
an agreement with Attorney Darwin De
Golia to press the suit. While this was
pending Byrod was induced to attempt
in repudiate the contract, and this led to
many unpleasant publications. This
morning, by his attorney, he assured
Judge Greene that he was thoroughly
satisfied with the condition of affairs, and
the battle to recover the estate of his
late wife will now be vigorously fought
by Attorney DeGolia.
BROWN-TISDAtE AFFAIR
ASSUMES A NEW PHASE
ENTIRE SCHOOL DEPARTMENT
IS INVOLVED.
Municipal League Reaches Out for
the Official Head of Superin
tendent Sullivan.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, March 23.
Not satisfied with having opened war
on School Directors Lanktree and Tisdale.
with the idea of securing their official
scalplocks. the Municipal Lague has been
looking about for other game and has
trained its suns on School Superintendent
Sullivan.
lirainard C. Brown, George W. Scott
and James K. Lynch, the committee ap
pointed by the league to conduct the
School Trust.-c fight, issued their procla
mation of war this evening. They start
out with the assertion that the object o.f
the routing of the old School Board and
the alleged ring existing among the mem
bers is "to bring the schools of the city
up to the standard of excellence which
the Intelligence and character of Its in
habitants, and the amount of money
spent on their support, justly entitle our
people to expect."
This is a very broad hint that the Ala
meda schools are not exactly what they
have been cracked up to be. After this
opening gun the league committee pro
ceeds to throw hot shot into the whole
School Department in the following style;
â¢'lt is imperatively necessary to tree the
schools from the small political methods
which have dominated them; to provide
better buildings and more classrooms that
each child may receive its fair share of
attendance; to secure teachers enough to
this end whose only qualifications shall
be merit and efficiency: to adopt a course
of study In line with the best thought of
the modern authorities on educationâ a
cause the keynote of which shall be sim
plicity, and ihoroughness its guiding
principle; and lastly, to appoint a Super
intendent who will give his time to his
work, and not to the repairing of his po
litical fencesâ a Superintendent whose
tenure of office shall be made secure by
excellent service and impartial adminis-
The alleged "ring" which. It is claimed,
has been using the School Department as
a political machine has made no reply
to the charges since Dr. Tisdale's cele
brated telephone interview with B. C.
Brown. The wires have been repaired,
and communication restored with the
Brown fortifications. However, Dr. Tis
dale has not taken advantage of the situ
ation to do any more long-distance talk
ing with his political enemy. J. B. Lank
tree, the doctor's colleague, has profited
by the Brown-Tisdale affair and is saying
nothing. He will not discuss School
Board affairs, and will walk around a
block rather than pass by a telephone.
It is announced that In the event of the
Municipal League being successful in its
endeavor to reorganize the School Depart
ment Professor A. W. Scott, principal of
the High School, or Professor Charles
Hughes of the Encinal School, will be
elevated to the position of Superintendent.

In the doubles tournament last year Gog
gin and Masten were winners and were
challenged by the team that played
against them last night. Hamma and
Ryder won the first game of the cham
pionship series, but their opponents very
neatly captured the last two.
SHE WAS NOT A
DYNAMITE FIEND
Steward Borchert Received a Scare
and Oakland a Twelve-
Pound Son.
OAKLAND. March 23.â Steward Bor
chert and Matron McDonald of the Re
ceiving Hospital had a novel and exciting
experience to-night. A woman giving the
name of Mrs. Wallace appeared at the
hospital with a valise and calmly ad
vised the attendants to prepare for the
worst.
She appeared to be rational, but, sus
pecting that there was something wrong
with her mentally, the steward tele
phoned for the patrol wagon. Before the
wagon arrived the visitor retired Into the
women's ward with Matron McDonald,
and a little later Steward Borchert was
informed that there was a new citizen
in Greater Oakland.
At midnight Mrs. Wallace and her
twelve-pound eon were receiving the
congratulations of the hospital staff.

DEMOCRATS SCHEME
IN RETALIATION
Plan to Seize the Patronage of the
State Penitentiaries.
Special Session of the Siate Central Committee Urged to
Instruct the Prison Directors How to Vote
for Warden of San Quentin.
Political sossirr- Â»Â« " n Mtlr over a !
jn-.'jnd coup that the Democrats are
planning in retaliation upon Governor
and hie adviser, D. M. Hums, for
efforts to seize the valuable pa
the water front Democratic
schemers, shrewd and quick to grasn^
an advantage, dec-lore that they wilri
take to themselves all of the patronage
of the Stale penitentiaries at Folsom
end at 6an Quentin. To make, the situ
ation serious the Democrats have the
power to carry their threat into execu
tion. They may dismiss the. warden j
and secretary of each prison and .
igh newly elected wardens and;
taries seize all of the patronage.
â¢ ; ige's kindergarten ex- ;
r the tutelage of Dan Burns,
in the dangerous field of politics are
likely therefore to bear bitter fruit for
Republicans who have been secure from
. . n of ' interf* i
much . ittack of determined re
taliation. When Governor Gage at
tempted, at the instigation of those
that surround him. to reorganize the
administration of the water front it
was feared that trouble would follow.
It was palpable that the Governor's
purpose was to become a party spoils
man, eager to go farther, under the ad-
In the search for the
fruits of victory than most spoilsmen.
Republicans feared the consequences
9 and the Democrats
sought some means of checkmating the
advise! s of the chief executive. ;
When the Governor failed in his
6chen rganization he planned
another to take the patronage of the
water front away from the Democrats, j
worthy gentlemen, who are
clinging with the tenacity of death to
what they have and praying to provi
dence f'*r more, were more than ever
determined to retaliate They wore not \
long in finding an avenue for revenge.
State prisons offered an asylum
f ir good I >emocrats and there, the lead
â¢emocrats shall go â but
â  â  â¢ wear striped uniforms. A small
army of men is needed to govern the |
State penitentiaries, officers, clerks, sec- j
es, guards, watchmen and at- j
Ots of all sorts. The salaries are
and the duties few. The Demo- i
â¢ rats are planning, therefore, inspired j
by the political blunders of the Gover
nor, to snatch from beneath the ashes j
of the embers of victory. ;
The State Board of Prison Directors
Is Democratic. Four of the membersâ
Ray, Fitzgerald, Wllkins and Devlin
appointed by Governor Budd for
a term of ten years. Devlin is a Re
publican and with Hayes makes a Re- ,
publican minority of two. The Demo- '
crats in the board, therefore, may do
as they please. Democratic leaders and .
politicians have now on foot a project ;
t i call a special meeting of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee and ff
cure from it a series of resolutions in-
Btructing the State Prison Directors to \
turn the entire patronage of both peni- â 
tentiaries over to Democrats.
This unusual action, it is claimed, is j
politically Justified by the action of
Governor Gage in striving to usurp the
patronage of the water front. Since a j
chief executive of a State may show
himself so greedy a seeker after the
loaves and fishes, other men les3 exalt- :
ed in the State government certainly j
have the same privilege. This Â«fi the !
argument that the Democrats arp us- !
Ing. and with which they are frighten- '
ing Republican officeholders into fits.
If the Democratic State <'--ntral Com
mittee meets i - this question j
it will have to do so quickly, as the
next Warden of San Quentin will be
en by the Prison Directors on
April 8.

It has been a custom for many years
in this .State for the Democrats and
the Republicans to divide the patron
age of the Stato penitentiaries. Th<
Warden and secretary of each institu
tion are appointed by the Prison Dire
tors. The Warden, in his turn, selen
all of the ether employes from thi
highest to the lowest. The Prisoi
Directors, however, have for man.'
years, no matter what the political
complexion of 1 hi- majority has beei
chosen a Democrat as Warden of om
prison and a Republican as Warder
of the other. Warden Hale, for ex
ample, is a Republican, and Wa
Aull is a Democrat.
The Democrats declare that they will
violate this precedent and teach Gov
ernor Oage a new lesson in the eentle
art of practical politics. Game's in-
Btruction may preve to lie a costiy ob
ject lesson to many Republicans. The
affair is made doubly Interesting by the
fact that Governor <iuge has already
selected the man who, he says, shall be
the next "Warden of San Quentin. This
protege of the Governor is Martin G.
Aguirre, an ex-Sheriff of Los Angeles.
Governor Gagre is bo deeply interested
in the election of Aguirre that he has
made. It is claimed, a personal appeal
to at least one of the Democratic mem
bers of the Board of Prison Directors.
These seductive whispering? of the
chief executive, it is said, have not yet
met with that response which one of
such high degree has a right to ex
pect. Politics is politics, the Demo
crats reply, and tit for tat is swÂ« t
revenge.
The Governor, therefore, is douhiy
concerned. It is bad enough to he
burned in taking a lesson in fire, but
to be burned twice is asking too much
even from a novice in the game. The
Governor is likely to lope the warden
ship of San Quentin for his protege I
Aguirre as well as the entire patronage j
of both prisons. In this game of the
politicians Warden Hale does not seem
to be a factor of the slightest conse
quence. He flirted with the powers
that be for a while, but his attentions â 
at Sacramento were repulsed with
scorn.
His term as Warden expires on April
20, and on April S the Board of Prison
Directors will el>=ct his successor. It
is at this meeting that the Democrats
intend to carry out their scheme of
grabbing all of the patronage of the
prisons. As a matter of course all of I
the employes cannot be removed at
once, as demoralization might follow
in the prison. The officers, under the
conditions of the scheme, will be re
moved gradually.
As yet the Democrats have not dis
cussed the name of any one to suc
ceed Hale, but there will be no dearth
of aspirants. There are scores of Dem
ocrats for every place, and when the
time comes the Prison Directors will
be overwhelmed with petitions, big and
little.
The prospective conditions in refer
ence to Folsom State Prison are dif
ferent. The term of Warden Aull will
not expire until January 1, 1900. The
term of B. F. Smith, clerk of Folsom
prison, will not end until October 1 of
this year. The Directors are not con
cerned, therefore, with the election of
'â¢â  the successors to these men at this
I time.
While every effort has been made to
keep this Democratic scheme a secret
the facts have leaked out and Republi
' can leaders, solicitous for the welfare
of their party, are wondering where the
Quixotic, blundering political methods
of the Governor are going to lead them
next.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAT.L, FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 1399.
FELL THIRTY FEET
INTO A SHIP'S HOLD
Mrs. Alice Ortega Probably Fatally Injured on
the British Ship Leicester Castle.
MRS. ALICE ORTEGA, a waitress
in a "creamerie" on Kearny
etreet, nearly met her death on
the British ship Leicester Castle
yesterday morning.
She and a friend named Mary Connors
went down to the vessel to hid some of
the apprentice boys good-by. They
were standing near the. fore hatch
talking, when Mrs. Ortega lost . her
balance and fell head first into the
lower hold, thirty feet below. The
first mate and one of the apprentices
quickly grot into the lower hold and
found the woman unconscious and
bleeding from the ears. A ' hatch
coyer and a mattress were lowered
own, and on them the woman was
-laced and carefully hoisted to the
deck. She was then carried into the
cibin and laid In thp mate's berth,
where she recovered consciousness
and complained of a pain in her back.
A telephone message wa.s sent to the
Harbor Receiving Hospital as soon as
the accident happened, and the ambu
lance was down to the wharf almost
â  as the woman had been placed
in the mate's berth. The Leicester
Castle is In ballast, and consequently
was very high out of the water.
Everybody was in a quandary for a
few minutes over the getting of Mrs.

er was placed in a sling and then the
woman was laid on the stretcher. The
falls of the after lifeboat were then
unhooked and made fast to the slim?,
and in this way Mrs. Ortega .was
swung out over the side of the ship
and lowered to the wharf, where the
hospital attendants took charge of her.
On arriving at the hospital Dr. yon
der Lf-ith mad* an examination and
found that Mrs. Ortega had her col
lar-bone broken, her skull fractured
and was probably injured Internally.
The Leicester Castle is lying at Lom
bard-street wharf and is going to
Ta'.tal, .Peru, to load nitrate for Eng
land. Her ballasting was to have been
finished yesterday, and then she was
t<> have gone Â.,
tory to sailing. The apprentice boys
on the ship had been In the ho
going to the creamerie for an
BionaJ meal, and that is how they got
acquainted with Mrs. Ortega and Miss
Connors. Thinking it would !>e their
last chance to see the young men. the
two women went down to the ship.
I'pon going aboard they met the mate
and he called the apprentices. The

the defense, tried to tangle the wit
ness up, but failed. With a view to
continuing the case in the upper
court.. he examined Mrs. Ashmore at
length, but did not swerve her a par
ticle;'
Miss Dora Knell, a sister to Mrs.
Ashmore, then took the stand. There
was more craning of necks in the
courtroom, as it is seldom that such a
pretty witness appears in such uncon
genial surroundings. . Miss Knell was
unused to the ways of the law and
was greatly amused at the quibbling
of counsel. At one stage of her tes
timony she burst out into laughter,
and at the sight of her pearly teeth
Judge Barry forgot his dignity and
joined in the mirth* and was rapped
to order by his own bailiff.
Miss Knell admitted having Joined
in the chase after the culprit, but was
quickly allowed to depart, as Attor

er her with too many questions.

TEACHERS CUNT
AGREE ON A
COMPROMISE
Considered the Clarke
Resolutions.
NOTHING WAS ACCOMPLISHED
ATTORNEYS CRESWELL AND
OLNEY QUESTIONED.
Meeting in the Auditorium of the
Girls' High School Provokes a
Long and Fruitless
Parley.
From 4 o'clock yesterd.iv afternoon till
7 in the evening the teachers assembled
for peaceful discussion in the auditorium
of the Girls' High School on the woof
! worn proposition of unpaid salaries in
dulged their forensic inclinations and ac
complished nothing.
The meeting was specially called to act
upon the Clarke resolutions which serve
as a substitute for the compromise meas
ure. The resolutions prepared and intro-
I duced by F. H. Clarke read as follows:
Be it resolved, that the committee on Utlga
| tlon be and hereby Is given full power to dU-
I pose of the litigation now pending before the
Superior Court, subject to the following con
'l. Â°No' assignment of teachers' salary claims.
2 The restriction of the claims of the mer
chant creditors to the amount of cash that tne>
would actually receive under the committee 8
plan, at least until the payment of sa.arles
for the balance of the fiscal year has been as
sured.
A reading of the resolutions was not
necessary, for every delegate present
came armed with a printed copy. ihe
etorm broke loose as soon as Chairman
Brooks recited the purpose of the con
vention. A heated discussion began by
the supporters of compromise measures
and their opponents, the anti-compro
misers. This lasted for a half-hour, when
it was discovered that Harry T. CresweU
and Warren Olney. the attorneys for the
teachers, were in the hall. A motion was
then made to have the gentlemen of the
law on the stage. It was carried, but not
without opposition, for the antagonists or
compromise did not wish to shower favors
upon the attorneys who recommended
such measures.
Cresweli and Olney took their peats on
the platform and were subjected to a bat
â¢ tery fire of questions from the army of
teachers who wished to be enlightened on
the legal aspect of the case. They stood
their own, pupplying whole volumes of
law at a grasp. The teachers were satis
fled and the attorneys departed.
After being sidetracked a dozen or more
times ihe teachers at last reached the pre
vious question. Whether to compromise
with the merchants and secure their
June salaries or to get a portion of their
November and December salaries and
! take a chance at not receiving their June
salaries were the questions discussed.
The Clarke resolutions favor a rellnquish
i merit of the November and December in
order to guarantee the June salaries and
j leave the $35,000 surplus to the merchants.
The meeting was adjourned until April
; 3. when the matter will further be con-
I sldered.
Examination of Teachers.
The examinations to be held on Monday
next at the Normal School In which aspi
rants may qualify for teachers' certifi
cates will be broad in their scope. They
will not be. limited to persona who want
to qualify for teachers' positions, but will j
be open also to persons -who -want to qual- ]
ify as special teachers. Many of these |
are at present teaching without the !
proper certificates, and Director Eells j
holds that the approval of their warrants
is a violation of the law. The special i
teachers who are included In this list
may take the examinations on Monday
and thus fortify themselves against the
time their present certificates are ques
tioned. If they do not qualify now and
their certificates are questioned they i
might be dropped from the rolls.
The apparent conflict of authority be- j
tween the Board of Education and the !
Board of Examiners is not one in reality. I
The School Directors postponed the ex
aminations at their last meeting until i
June. After this action, which was taken
contrary to the advice of Superintendent
Webster, it was found that the law made j
it imperative to hold these examinations .
seml-annually. Monday was the proper
time hence the action of the examiners ;
In determining to proceed with the work
as required by law. Had it been per
mitted to lapse until June there was a !
question if persons taking the examina- !
i tion at that time would legally qualify.
NELLIE PARTRIDGE MISSING.
The Young Lady Left Her Home Yes
terday and Failed to Return.
Considerable anxiety wfis manifested ,
by Miss Jennie Partridge, the assistant:
librarian of the Branch Public Library
at Station 5 over her sister Nellie's ab- |
pence from her home at 3128 Twenty-first j
street. Miss Nellie Partridge has been
noticed by her sister to be somewhat de- j
mented of late. She seemed absentmind
! Ed and indifferent to her surroundings. !
hut it was considered that this might in j
time and by kind treatment pass off, j
consequently no particular watch was I
kfpt over her actions other than to pro- |
vide tor her wants and see that she did j
not do anything out of the way to her- ;
self or those about her.
Yesterday afternoon, however, when j
her sister Jennie returned to her home |
from the Library she missed Nellie from
the house and made inquiries of Uie ;
neighbors if they had seen her. Not be- ,
lne able to ascertain anything regarding

HUNTINGTON
AND HERRIN
TO BE INDORSED
No Changes Impend
ing in the S. P.
ANNUAL MEETING ON APRIL 5
GLAD THAT THE GOVERNMENT
DEBT IS LIQUIDATED.
Ownership of the Central Pacific Now
Lies in the Southern Pacific
Company â Details of Con
solidation.
C. P. Huntington is journeying by easy
stages from New York to San Francisco,
expecting to arrive here in ample time to
attend the annual meeting of the South
ern Pacific Company on Wednesday,
April 5. George Crocker will arrive in
this city next Monday.
Of late there has been a deal of con
j<=cture regarding Important change*
in the leading departments of the com
pany, but the most authentic informa
tion obtainable is to the effect that the
changes will be few and unimportant.
Will H. Crocker, one of the directors of
the institution, does not expect any ma
terial readjustment in the organization.
He entertains the opinion that there will
be no change In the heads of depart
ments and does not hesitate to pronounce
the story that Mr. Herrin will be severed
fron the control of the law department
as a pure invention.
"You can publish the fact In The Call,"
remarked Mr. Crocker, 'Hhat there will
be no important changes in the manage
ment. It Is now a matter of history that
the Central Pacific debt to the Govern
ment has been paid in full. The pay
ment is practically accomplished. C. P.
Huntingdon will be re-elected president
of the Southern Pacific. Mr. Herrin will
remain at the head of the law depart
ment. He will not be retired or asked
!<> resign. George Crocker and myself no
doubt will be re-elected on the board.
Russell J. Wilson and Charles Lathrop
will continue to serve on the directory.
There is a feeling of relief that the debt
to the. Government has been liquidated
and there Is a feeling of gratification that
the interests of the company are well
managed."
The consolidation of thÂ»; Southern Pa
cific and Central Pacific has not yet been
perfected in detail, but there is no ques
tion that the ownership of the Central
line now lies in the, Southern Pacific.
The stockholders of the Central Pacific
will receive Southern Pacific certificates
or bonds in lieu of their Central Pacific
holdings. Some little time will bo re
quired to execute all the details con
nected with the consolidation.
The impression is gained from conver
sation with Southern Pacific people that
a season of harmony in the management
is dawning. The new era is so bright and
promising that Mr. Herrin's political sinÂ«
may be condoned in the carnival of re
joicing.
