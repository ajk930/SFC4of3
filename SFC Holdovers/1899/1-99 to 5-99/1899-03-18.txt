SOUTHERN PACIFIC COMPANY
OFFERS A BRIBE TO BARNES
CALL HEADQUARTERS/
SACRAMENTO, March 17.â |
This city is the scene to-day of
one of the greatest public scan
dals that ever dishonored Califor
nia. Dan Burns and the South
ern Pacific Company have given
to the State an incident of ill fame
without comparison in -the' polit
ical history of the State.
An authorized agent of the
Southern Pacific Company has
offered General W. H. L. Barnes
a bribe of his own selection to re
tire from the Senatorial contest in
favor of Burns.
This is a statement of the situ
ation that has no parallel in State
legislative annals. B. U. Stein
nian, an ex-Mayor of this city,
claiming to represent W. F. Her
rin and the Southern Pacific
Company's interests, has asked
General Barnes to name his price
to retire as a Senatorial candidate
in favor of D. M. Burns. The
bribe so audaciously offered was
refused by Barnes, not only as a
grossly impudent personal insult
to him, but as an attempted out
rage upon the people of the
State.
The affair has created the sen
sation of the legislative session.
Assemblymen and Senators are
discussing it in indignation in the
streets. Sessions of both houses
have been interrupted by the
eager and resentful comment of
members. Political gossips of the
town are whispering the secret of
shameful facts that are now pubâ
li*- property.
D. M. Burns has taken one
step too far in his disgraceful ef
forts to steal the honor of repre
senting California in the United
States Senate.
He has surrounded himself
here with a band of political
thugs. He has chosen as man
agers and lieutenants men noto
riously known in political circles, j
He has employed methods and
used artifices to cajole, threaten
and debauch legislators, and has
1 â¢ 1 A 1 r 1 â¢
covered with the shame 01 his
conduct the sessions of public
"men who will not accept dishonor
by honoring him. He has allied j
himself with the giant corpora- j
tion â the Southern Pacific Com
pany. His agents have offered
bribes to legislators and have
sought to corrupt public men
where corruption suggested itself â¢

as a vehicle of success. .And now, I
to reach an evil climax in his dis
reputable campaign, an author
ized representative of W. F. Her
rin attempts almost openly to
bribe a formidable and honorable
aspirant to get out of the race for
Senatorial honors.
The facts of the affair are thor
oughly known. At io o'clock
last night B. U. Steinman asked
General Barnes to accept a bribe
in order that William F. Herrin
might succeed in electing Dan
Burns to the United States Sen
ate. General Barnes was in his
headquarters at the Golden Eagle
when Steinman called. Ex-Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of
California John Currey. Thomas
V. Cator, Theodore Reichert and
others were present at the time in
the general's rooms.
Steinman entered and asked
| General Barnes for the courtesy
of a private interview. Steinman
is a man very generally known in
this city.
He was once Mayor of Sacra
mento and is the man who sought
and accepted admission to the
home of his closest and dearest
friend in order that he might
have the opportunity to debauch
that friend's wife. To his evil
credit Steinman succeeded in
making himself a dastard. He is
a man who still possesses great
influence in this city. He is a
banker, merchant, tradesman and
political parasite of the" Southern
Pacific Company. He enjoys
privileges from the corporation
and is recognized as its official
representative in affairs that will
not bear public scrutiny. Inci
dentally Steinman is the controll
ing spirit of the Farmers' and
Mechanics' Bank of this city.
When he asked last night for
a private interview, General
Barnes readily accorded it and
ushered Steinman into an adjoin
ing room. The visitor was not j
long in explaining his mission.
"General Barnes," he said, "I
know that some of your support- j
ers are tiring of their allegiance

to you; as they wish to be released
and, be given an opportunity to
cast their votes for Colonel
Burns. 1 come to speak to you
in reference to the matter."
Barnes was dumfounded. He
had heard of no defection among
his supporters, nor of any (threat
ened desertions from his ranks.
He has made an honorable,
straightforward contest, and the
men who have supported him
have done so from an honest con
viction that he is, of all the con
testants, the best fitted for the
honor.;
What you tell me surprises
me." he said. "I have heard
nothing of desertions among my
supporters, but if any of the men
who have voted for me wish now
to vote for somebody else I can
â¢ not prevent them. I have no
claim upon them other than their
| own opinion that I am worthy of
J their votes. That opinion and.
i nothing else has dictated their ac
| tion in voting for me. I have
i made an honest, honorable and
I open contest; for the ,'â  United
I States Senatqrship and; if any of
I the â¢ men .who : have : voted : for me
| wish now to vote for somebody,
I else all I can; say is that; they, are j
the arbiters of their own ac-
tions, and whatever they do I
-
.thank them for the support they
have given me and for the honor
they have conferred with their
votes upon me."
. Steinman seemed to be puzzled
at this reply. Something was
wrong somewhere, as his looks
then and his words later clearly
proved. He decided, however, to
come directly to the point, to tell
who and what he is, to refer to
his masters and make the dis
graceful offer that he believed
would prostitute a man into a dis
honorable act. r yfy^y.
"General Barnes." said Stein
man, "the time has come when
you ought to get out of this fight.
As I have told you, your support
ers want to vote for " Colonel
Burns and you are in duty bound
to give them freedom to follow
their inclinations. I recognize in
this matter that you, as well as
they, have rights. I know that
you have been here for nearly
three months under great ex
pense. You have necessarily neg
lected your practice and should
be reimbursed. If you will make
a reasonable estimate of the
money that will represent to you
a financial consideration for your
loss of time and your expendi
tures I will give you a check for
the amount upon my bank."
Barnes jumped to his feet
angry and threatening. There
could be no misunderstanding
now of the motive of Steinman's
visit.
"You contemptible scoun
drel!" shouted Barnes; "what is
there in my career that gives you,
despicable as you are. or any one
else the right to insult me by the
offer of a bribe? I have acted
honorably while I have been in
this contest and I will go out of
it as I have acted in . it. . Get: out
of here or I will kick you out!"
Barnes' angry words were dis
tinctly heard in the adjoining
room. Barnes rushed to the door
to carry out his threat.
Steinman. . confused, bewil
dered and utterly off his guard,
expostulated. explained and
pleaded in eager tones. It was
then that he betrayed the secret
of his criminal trust and exposed
the part that the Southern Pacific
Company is striving, with its
money and its bribe givers, to
play in the political affairs of Cali
fornia..
"My God, General." pleaded
Steinman: "I have offered you no
bribe. Haven't you heard from
Herrin?"
Barnes had opened the door.
"Get out of here, you cur!" he
cried. "I haven't heard from
Herrin and have heard too much

from you. Get out!"
Steinman went, and the mci
dent that has supplied the gross
est scandal of Dan Burns' dis
honorable contest was over.
I â¢ Barnes btirsf excitedly into the
adjoining room, where ex-
Chief Justice Currey, Thomas V.
Cator, Theodore Reichert and
others sat and had heard the
stormy meeting between Stein
man and the General. Barnes
was trembling with excitement
and rage.
"A currish agent of the South
i crn Pacific Company, this man
; Steinman." he said, "has offered
! me a bribe to get out of this fight.
; I have kicked him out."
A few words from ex-Justice
| Currey calmed Barnes.
"Why did not you control your
i temper?" said Currey. "An of
fense of this magnitude is some
. thing more than simply personal
to you. Steinman should have
been trapped. You should have
calmed yourself and called me
into the room. You" then could
have explained the character of
the bribe to me, and under the
pretense of considering it asked
Imy advice. We would have had
i the scoundrel caught, and per
haps could have rendered a pub
lic service by trapping his mas
ter, the Southern Pacific Com
pany."
It was not long before the de
tails of the disgraceful affair cir
culated through the streets.
Burns and his managers had
passed even the line that marks
their dubious notions of inde-
I cency- â Honorable men of every;
i political faction are indignant
I that the Southern Pacific Com
: pany and its parasites have
I brought this disgrace upon the
\ State. The Mexican and his sup
! porters are being denounced from
every quarter.
Steinman lost no time in leav
ing town after his disgraceful
duty to the railroad people had
been performed. He took the
morning train for San Francisco.
At i .30 o'clock this afternoon
General Barnes called a confer
ence of his supporters, to whom
he related the incidents of the
meeting with Steinman. These
men are now more than ever de
termined to stand with their
leader, if for no other purpose
than to repudiate the shameful
effort that has been made to drag
their names into the dishonored
service of political tricksters.2

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 17.â As. a last desperate
resort the followers of Burns may at
tempt to bring the Senatorial contest to
a finish amid scenes of- darkness, confu
sion and debauchery.
There is talk this evening of a recess
of the joint convention to-morrow after
several ballots have been taken and re
convening the session after dark. This
suggestion has alarmed many members
cf the Legislature who have consistently
adhered to the doctrine that the contest
should be conducted in open daylight and
free from all the bad influences of a dark
lantern caucus.
A night session of the joint convention
during the expiring hours of the session
would offer temptation for the introduc
tion of scenes that would re
flect discredit upon the fair name
of California. The measure of public
scandal should not be increased by scenes
of confusion in a midnight session of the
joint convention.
The subject of a recess was discussed
in the camps of Barnes, Grant and Scott
to-day. and a firm determination to resist
the scheme was expressed. The conven
tion will assemble as usual at noon, and
every opportunity will be afforded for
each Senator and Assemblyman to ex
press his choice for Senator. As many
ballots as desired will be taken in order
to give the fullest scope for agreement,
but the project to prolong the session
until the midnight hour will meet de
termined resistance.
To-night the air is full of rumors con
cerning the offer of bribes to influence the
votes of members of the Legislature. The
doubt no longer exists that railroad
money has been brought into the fight.
The dastardly attempt of the railroad
tool, B. U. Steinman, to procure by the
use of money the withdrawal of General
Barnes from the contest, has excited
among the honorable and respected mem
bers of the Legislature a feeling of pro
found contempt and scorn for the cor
rupt agent and his corrupt principal.
On the other hand a high sense of ad
miration is expresed for the honor and in
tegrity of General Barnes. The general
is commended for his prompt action in
expelling from his rooms the contemptible
agent of corruption. When the followers
of Barnes heard to-day of the scene which
occurred last night they resolved in con
ference to adhere with renewed fidelity to
his cause. --y
Van R. Paterson received one vote In
joint convention to-day. He is a Repub
lican candidate, but his voting strength
to-day was derived from Senator Lang
ford, a veteran Democrat. There is a
story behind the vote. It transpires that
Paterson is the second choice of the
Southern Pacific for Senator. Not long
SANTA CLARA SENDS
A STRONG PROTEST
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 17.â Good Govern
ment League of Santa Clara County has
sent in to the Governor, the Senate and
Assembly a strong protest against the
measures now pending in both houses, in
creasing the number of officers in Santa
Clara County, or the salaries of the offi
cers now existent.
The communication was offered in the
Assembly this rooming by Assemblyman
Arnerich and will be printed in the jour
nal to-morrow.
The communication is as follows:
To his Excellency, the Governor, the Senate
and Assembly of the State of California: In
behalf of the Republican Good Government
League, representing over 2500 Republican
voters of Santa Clara County, we most earn

of the fifty-first fiscal year at .58, <_
and for the fifty-second fiscal year 4
at .51. This includes for both years 4
the university tax of .02. This levy 4
is, of course, based upon the gen- 4
eral appropriation bill, which is di- 4
vided among the different funds as 3
follows: 4
Fifty-first fiscal year: 4
General fund $4,000,722 4

! Although the appropriation bill of 4
this year is $200,000 less than that of <
'97. the tax levy is greater. The 4
rate for the forty-ninth fiscal year <
was .51, and for the fiftieth year 4
.48 8-10. This condition is accounted 4
for by the fact that at this session 4
a measure has been passed extend- <?
ing the age of orphans and half- 4
orphans who receive State aid from 4
14 to 16 years, necessitating an in- 4
crease in the appropriation of $150,- 4
i 000. 'â¢/_'.'-â¢ .-' 4
The levy bill was offered in the
Assembly at 2 o'clock this after
noon by Chairman Valentine of the
Ways and Means Committee. He
introduced it under a suspension of
the rules and it was put on a hurry
order to the State printing office.
It was returned from there at 5
o'clock and put through its second
and third readings. By 5:15 o'clock
it was ready for transmission to
the Senate.
I since a well-known Democrat in San
Francisco went around to Democratic
merchants and friends with a petition
: asking members of the Democratic faith
in the Legislature to support Paterson.
Many signatures were obtained and then
negotiations were opened for the retire
ment of Burns from the race and the in
; troduction of the second choice. -Mr. Pat
erson came here to-day and established
himself at the Capitol Hotel. He may get
some votes to-morrow, but his accessions
will not come from the Barnes, Grant
and Scott camps. It is rumored to-night
that Owen Wade of Napa is willing to
, transfer his allegiance from Estee to Pat
erson. - - v -
Colonel J. P. Jackson, Collector of the
Port of San Francisco, arrived to-day. He
had a long conference with Judge Way
mire. and it transpires that the latter
exhibited to the Collector the letter Mark
Hanna wrote, in which so much anxiety
waa expressed for the election of a -Re
publican Senator. It appears now . that
Hanna suggested that the Waymire per
sonality should be introduced in the con
test here as a compromise feature, and
Waymire was deeply impressed with the
wisdom and propriety of the suggestion.
He outlined to Colonel Jackson the ad
mirable features of the proposition.
Judge Waymire desired Jackson to pre
sent the suggestion to U. S. Grant. It
was fancied by the Judge that Colonel
Burns would not object to retirement in
favor of a candidate commended by
Hanna.
The cordial relations existing between j
General Barnes and the Judge were
counted upon as a guarantee that the j
General would support the scheme, and l
the opinion was expressed that the Scott j
vote would go to the Judge. Judge Way- i
mire conveyed the impression that he I
would accept the office if the other candi
dates would retire in his favor and make
the offer.
Judge Slack, law partner of Van .R.
Paterson, arrived from San Francisco to- ;
night. He was accompanied by George
D. Shadburne. It is known that they are
here to give support to the Senatorial as
pirations of Mr. Paterson. It would be
no surprise to those who are close in the
confidence of Burns if the strength of
the Candelarian were transferred to Pat
erson on one of the many ballots in pros
pect to-morrow.
To-night at room 29 of the Capitol Hotel
Van R. Paterson was waited upon by sev- |
eral members of the Legislature. In re- I
ply to inquiries concerning his candi- ;
dacy Mr. Paterson remarked that he was
in the race at the solicitation of his ,
friends, who had urged him to come here. '
It is predicted that he will get some ;
Democratic votes to-morrow, but his sup
porters do not venture to estimate the
strength he will derive from representa- j
tives of that party. 7." 7."
of a general levy, and the fees collected by
the several officers, amounted to the follow
ing: - â¢â¢â¢::
General tax levy 9 cents $50,861
Fees and fines , 23,000
Total $73,861
That by the act of 1897, section 161, the sala
ries of officers in said county were Increased
in the sum of $15,800.
That in addition to the numerous salaried
officers created by the Board of Supervisors the
officers and salaries provided by the statute
of 1597 are as follows, payable from the County
Treasury:
County Clerk, per annum $ 9,000
County Clerk, additional deputy 1,200
Sheriff (and mileage in certain cases) 9,7.20
Recorder 8,000
Auditor 4.000
Tax Collector (including license fees).... 7,000
Treasurer 4,000

Surveyor fees
Coroner 600
Each Supervisor 1.200
Each Supervisor as Road Commissioner. 500
Public Administrator fees
Health Officer 600
It would seem that the above salaries are
most liberal, In fact, almost extravagantly so.
And under this act of 1897 the salary fund of
Santa Clara County was as follows:
General levy $73,981
Fees and fines collected 24,836
Total $98,817
An Increase over 1894 of tax levy from 9 to
14.50 cents, and an increase of amount raised
of $24,956.
It Is proposed by the bills now before the
Senate and Assembly to add the following, per
section 161: . -Â. rr
Clerk of Board of Supervisors.... $1,500
Under Sheriff 1,800
License Collector 1,800
District Attorney's clerk 1,200
Prosecuting Attorney, Justices' Court 1,500
County Surveyor, salary 2,400
County Surveyor, clerk 1,500
While in the Senate bill it Is proposed to give
the License Collector 10 per cent of the licenses
collected, which will amount to at least
annually the sum of $2500 In addition to his
salary of $1800.
In many other respects increased expendi
tures are provided. It is conceded by all offi
cials of our county that the present force of
officers is enough to fully and promptly dis
charge all the duties required of them by law.
Such proposed increase is unwarranted
and will add many thousands of dollars to our
already burdened tax payers.
Wherefore, in the Interests of good govern
ment, of economy, of justice and of the tax
payers of Santa Clara County we most ear
nestly protest against any change in the law
whereby the officers or their salaries are in
creased, or the powers of the county Board of
Supervisors enlarged. Most respectfully, |

BILL IS DULY APPROVED
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. March 17.â This has been an un
satisfactory day in the Assembly. It Is
the last day, practically, upon which bills
can be passed, and a bunch of the pet
charges of Dibble and Johnson, which
they had got together to put through at
the eleventh hour, were so bitterly fought
by the San Francisco delegation that Dib
ble became as angry as a bear with a
sore paw and sat and sulked and made
things uncomfortable.
He was hardest hit this evening when
Laird's $280,000 coyote scalp bill came up
for consideration. The House went into
committee of the whole on the measure,
and on a vote carried by the San Fran
cisco delegation recommended the bill do
not pass. Then Belshaw offered some
amendments to It, which were defeated,
and the bill was read a second time and
allowed to go over.
Johnson was sore, too. Probably no
member in the House is better posted on

CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 17.â The last Senatorial
ballot will be taken to-morrow. It will
find the supporters of U. S. Grant solidly
arrayed in the column of their candidate.
Burns having declared that if he were not
elected Senator he would prevent the elec
tion of anybody else, the Grant men Imve
flung back the challenge and declared that
their choice for Senator is U. S. Grant and
they will have no other.
' This decision was arrived at this even
ing at a caucus of the Grant forces at the
\ Golden Eagle Hotel. Of the thirty legis
lators who are voting for Grant only three
on four were absent, and those have since
i declared their intention of abiding by the
[ decision of ,the caucus.
i When the meeting was called to order
'- Senator Smith claimed the attention of
; those present, and stated that In his opin
ion the conditions of the Senatorial fight
' were such that he believed it impossible
! for Grant to be elected. He gave his rea
: sons for thinking so and asked for the
: opinion of others on the subject..
Senator Jones agreed with Smith, and,
like him, reaffirmed his allegiance to Mr.
Grant. At the same time he expressed
his doubts as to Grant's ability to secure
election at the hands of the present Leg
islature. Both Senators expressed a de
sire to see a good Republican elected, but
were unable to suggest how it could be
brought about. The statement regarding
the inability of Grant to secure election
provoked a storm of dissent from other
members present, and in a moment it
became apparent that with perhaps two
or three exceptions all were agreed that
their candidate stood an excellent chance
of election, and even if he did not it was
their desire to remain loyal to him. When
this sentiment, so strongly expressed, de
veloped both Senator Smith and Senator
Jones declared that they were ready and
willing to abide by the will of the ma
jority and accept the judgment of many
as against their own.
A resolution was then presented which
stated in effect that the supporters of
U. S Grant, who are now voting for him
for Senator, will continue to so vote until
ed in effect that the supporters of
5 Grant, who are now voting for him
Senator, will continue to so vote until
the adjournment of the Legislature.
This was received with much applause,
and all subscribed to it with the excep
tion of Assemblyman Marvin. In ex
plaining his reason for refusing to join
him he started in to turn the tables by
freezing what few measures they wanted
considered out of a hearing. OTfcad of Los
Angeles also got a little warm in the
region of his neckwear. He was engaged
in pushing a pet measure of his. reducing
the salaries of Los Angeles officials, and
discovered that A. J. Breuner, a Sacra
mento attorney, was on the floor lobbying
against his measure. He immediately of
fered a resolution barring Breuner from
the floor, and made a spirited talk in sup
port of it.
The House was put in good humor late
in the evening by a message from the
Governor announcing that he had ap
proved, without having vetoed a section,
the general appropriation bill. \ alentlne,
chairman of the Ways and Means Com
mittee, was particularly pleased, as the
bill is the product of two months of his
hardest labor. It is the first time on rec
ord that some disapproval has not been
announced by the executive.
Cowan of Sonoma ruffled up his neck
feathers next and tried to get a spike into
Valentine and Mead of Los Angeles. It
came about over Mead's salary reduction
bill upon which the Southron took occa
sion to roast Lobbyist Breuner. Mead s
bill provides for an immediate reduction
in salaries. Cowan offered an amendment
putting the operation of the bill off until
im Mr* Breuner was engaged in lobby
ing the amendment. In offering his
amendment Cowan said he , had no partic
ular interest in the amendment. He did
not care to interfere in the affairs of Los
Angeles County to the extent that one of
the Los Angeles County delegation had
interfered in the affairs of Sonoma Coun
ty and he looked hard at Valentine Then
he said he thought it was no worse to
have lobbyists on the floor than it was to
go" m tside and try to hold out enough
members to make a quorum In order that
a bill might not get consideration. lentlne
"Do you mean me? shouted Valentine
"Wear the shoe If it fits you," replied
Cowan. â . Â«Â«___._.â¢Â»
"He means me," yelled Mead, but I
can take care of myself." There was
more talk like this and then a vote on the
amendment. Befo-e it was announced
Miller of Los Ange.es demanded a call of
the House. Aye? and poesjw^re "a/"
and Belshaw in the chair declared that
the noes had it. 'then went .up .* roar.
The decision, to say the least, was a
close one. and all the backers of ( wan
and Miller set up a howl for division.
Belshaw would not grant it. and the San
Francisco delegation came to its feet with
a yell. Belshaw finally compromised on a
rollcall but before it was finished Cowan
moved 'to dispense with further proceed

EXPOSITION BILL
PASSES SENATE
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRAMENTO, March 17. -The exposition" 88
hill has passed the Senate. It took nearly an hour's talk, but finally â¦
went through to the accompaniment of great applause from the crowds 88
waiting to know its fate. Davis was the chief opponent of the measure, i,
and besides him Rowell was the only one who went to the length of words *?
in his opposition. Cutter was the first to speak for the bill, and then Simp- _\
son had a word of praise for the measure. Wolfe followed with an expla- +
nation of the purposes of the appropriation of $250,000, and asked that the 88
Senate pass the bill, yyy ff '-''yfyy-. f-Yf.y â¦
It was then Davis' turn. He bitterly denounced the measure. He. called it ?
a second-hand show; called attention to the high tax rate and demanded X
that the Influence of the lobby be disregarded by the Senators in the con- 4
sideration of the measure. He said the place to advertise California was 88
abroad, not at home, and he thought sufficient violence had been done the â¦
feelings of -he Senators when they voted to appropriate $130,000 to make a 8?
creditable showing at the big Paris Exposition. .4
Bettman spoke for the bill, as did Nutt and Morehouse before another 8?
voice of protest arose, this time from Rowell. He spoke briefly, but to the â¦
same effect as had Davis. , Wolfe closed matters, with a ringing speech ',_ for S3
the bill. The vote was as follows: Ayesâ Ashe. Bettman, Braunhart, Bur- â¦
nett, Chapman, Currier, Cutter, Dickinson,- Doty, Dwyer, Feeney, Goad, 88
Hall, Hoey. Morehouse, Nutt, Pace, Prlsk, Shortrldge, Simpson, Sims, Tay- +

i with the others in subscribing to the reso
i lution, he said it was his desire that a
' United States Senator should be elected
j and he did not care to pledge himself to
I one candidate and thus bind himself in a
i manner that would prevent him from
, voting for some other candidate in case
he believed' such other candidate had a
j chance of election. One of the members ;
! present asked Marvin if he would vote for
; Burns. He replied that he would if it was
I demonstrated . to him that Burns had a
j reasonable chance of election. The defec
tion of Marvin did not have a depressing
effect on the others present, for even if
he deserted Grant for Burns his vote '
would count for little and would In no
I way militate against Grant's chances of
j election, and would certainly add little to
Burns' chances. of success.
During the last few days it has been
; freely asserted by the Burns touts that
j Assemblyman Merrill of San Francisco !
I would vote for Burns when required to !
! do so by the Mexican for. the reason that
he is under obligations to Burns for some
slight favors done him in the past. These
rumors were set at rest to-night by Mer
rill himself. He said that he had been
casting his vote for U. S. Grant from the
beginning of the session and would con-
I tinue to vote for him to the end. He also
Stated that if Grant should withdraw from
the contest he would cast his vote for 'â 
some other candidate, but not for D. M. 'â â 
Burns.
The legislators' who, by their votes, I
have been supporting General W. H. L. ;
1 Barnes candidacy for United States Sen- I
i ator, held a conference during the after
noon and agreed among themselves to !
I contlnuesto support their candidate to the I
; end. The meeting was held In General I
; Barnes' headquarters. Golden Eagle Ho- i
tel, and was attended by the twenty-two :
supporters of the general, with the ex- !
ception of Senators Stratton and Dickin-
Bon, who were unavoidably detained at j
the Capitol.
When all had assembled General Barnes
related the details of the attempt that
had been made by ex-Mayor Ben U.
Steinman of Sacramento to induce him
to withdraw from the Senatorial contest
by the offer of a cash bribe. All present
expressed great indignation when the full
particulars of the cowardly offer were
made known to them. A general discus
sion was then indulged in regarding the
condition of the Senatorial contest, and
all present agreed to remain loyal. to the
candidacy of their leader to the end.
With this understanding the conference
adjourned.

.Paterson was again brought into
the Senatorial fight to-day by the
vote of Senator Langford, Demo
crat, of San Joaquin County. Mr.
Langford is the first Democrat to
vote for the Republican since this
Senatorial .fight opened, but it is
considered that his switch has no
political significance for the reason
that he is a- warm admirer of Mr.
Paterson's and they are neighbors.
Besides this, Mr. Langford received
from Mr. Paterson an hour before
the ballot a telegram asking him as
a neighborly favor to cast his vote
for him.
As the Barnes people feared
would be the case, Robinson of
Placer County changed his vote to
Grant when the first ballot made
an opportunity for him to do so.
Huber, Marvin and Merrill were
all made the subject of a wild
rumor that they would desert
Grant to go to Burns, but their
sound standing in the Grant camp
was too well known by those on the
inside to make them even a matter
of inquiry.

the Governor at 9:30 o'clock. There was a
general discussion before the Governor, E.
F. Preston appearing in behalf of the bill
providing for the sale of railway fran
chises and property now before the Gov
ernor for approval or veto.
The committee presented an amendment
which it desired to force upon the Legis-
I lature with the aid of the Governor's veto.
! The Governor took the ground that the
> veto should not be used where the Legis
â â  lature had unquestionably passed the law
with all the information before it. . He
â  seemed to be convinced that the Legisla
ture had knowingly, after full discussion,
! passed the measure as it stands. The
members of the committee took the posi-
I tion that if the bill was prejudicial to the
' interests of the State the Governor should
send it back for revision while there was
yet time. Senators Braunhart and Ashe,
; who were present, declared that if the bill
came up again in its present shape they
l would not vote for it. yyy.:
The points made against it were that
the sale of a California franchise to a
foreign corporation would divest . the
State of control over freights and fares.
This was disputed by Mr. Preston citing
I United States Supreme Court decision. .
! The principal point insisted upon by the
' committee, however, xvaa mat if __*_.*_ h . u.
j transfer as the bill contemplated were
I made the wise restrictions of the Califor
| nia law as to the amount of bonded In
i debtedness would be nullified; that the
I Southern Pacific Company of Kentucky
! would be free to issue bonds greatly in
I excess of the capital stock of the Central
! Pacific, and that as California is the most
! productive territory through which these
' roads run and with the increase of fixed
j charges against fictitious indebtedness
the burdens of the people would be made
greater than they are to-day.
The committee contended that the pro
i vision in the bill which allows a leased
'â  competing line to be purchased was to
i enable the Southern Pacific of Kentucky
\ to buy the Central Pacific, which it now
i leases, and thus evade the provisions of
I the California law, because as the Central
Pacific is a California corporation the
Southern Pacific of Kentucky can only
I be limited in the issuance of bonded in
! debtedness by the laws of Kentucky,
I which are very lax. In fine, the purpose
I of the bill is to enable the Santa Fe to
acquire in fee the road from The Needles
to Mojave. Tl'ere was every disposition
to aid the Santa Fe, but as the law must
j be general In its terms the opposition was
| apprehensive of the Southern Pacific. The
! Governor gave the committee a fair hear-
I ing, lasting fully four hours, and the mat
ter is now in his hands.
Senator Braunhart stated that when he
! sought to get the consent of General
i Counsel Sterry of the Santa Fe to an
amendment striking out the privilege
I given to purchase leased competing roads
i Sterry said that he could not consent
| without consulting General Counsel Her-
I rin of the Southern Pacific Company, and
the legislative committee voted down all
I amendments.
SENATE PASSES A BILL
FOR SCHOOLTEACHERS
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. March 17.â Squabbles in the va
rious county delegations are not edifying,
but that is what occupied much of the
time of the Senate to-day. The San Fran
cisco quarrel took first place and was over
the salary of the Public Administrator.
The bill submitted by Burnett made the
Public Administrator a salaried instead of
a feed officer, and the pay of the court
stenographers was reduced. Wolfe moved
that the bill be denied a third reading,
and there was nearly an hour's argument
on the question. Wolfe declared the bill
had never been submitted to the delega
tion for consideration, as is the custom
in any case where a bill affects only a sin
gle county. The merits of the bill were
practically lost sight of in the discussion,
and the motion to deny a third reading
was carried.
The Los Angeles delegation then had an
inning over the salaries of its officials.
According to ante-election arrangements
the bill reduced the salaries of all county
officers, except the District Attorney. Su
perintendent of Public Instruction.* Sher
iff and County Judges. Simpson wanted
to amend the bill, a proceeding which
would practically. kill it. and the row was
fought out over that question. No amend
ments were allowed and the bill passed.
Braunhart's bill to provide for an in
come tax, which was taken up on a mo
tion to reconsider after its defeat in the
Senate last night, was passed by a nar
row margin.
Luchsinger's amendment to the consti
tution providing a means whereby San
Francisco may pay the salaries due the
teachers for money withheld on account
of financial shortage, passed the Senate
this evening. The amendment provides
that San Francisco may at any time pay
unpaid claims, with interest at 5 per cent
per annum, for materials furnished and
work done during , the forty-first, forty
second., forty-third and forty-fourth fiscal
years, out of the Income <jf any succeed
ing year, the amount in full not to ex
ceed $300,000. This will also include the
city's "unpaid creditors" who have been
trying to recover for several years.
In a message to the Senate this even
ing the Governor announced his disap
proval of Senate bill No. 56, one of Cur
tin's measures, which provided for the
raising of the salaries of the Superior
Judges of Tuolumne County. The Gov
ernor's objection was to the title of the
bill, which, he declared, did not properly
describe the measure. Senator Curtin
will try to have the bill amended and
passed again to-morrow.
In a second message the Governor an
nounced his approval of Senate bill No.
9, another of Curtln's measures, relat
ing to the service of summons on foreign
corporations. :-,.â -

There to Select a New Man Whose Name

â¢ CALL â¢ HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 17.â One of the notable
events of the day in Sacramento, as far
as the Senatorial situation is concerned,
was the meeting between authorized rep
resentatives of the three Senatorial candi
dates.
The meeting was held in room 14 of the
Capitol building. Those present at. the
conference were Senators Shortridge and
Leavitt, representing D. M. Burns; Sen
ators Cutter and Smith, representing U.
S. Grant, and Senators Stratton and More
house, representing General W. H. L.
Barnes. The purpose of the meeting was
to have a general discussion of the situa
tion to the end of devising some means
if possible of reaching an agreement be
tween the rival candidates whereby a Sen
ator acceptable to the people of the State
could be elected. Concerted action on the
part of the opposing candidates would be
necessary to achieve this result, and it
was for the purpose of bringing about
such action that the meeting was held.
As a preliminary move all the repre
sentatives of the three candidates ad
mitted frankly that their individual can
didate had no chance of election under
existing conditions. This fact having been
established, all joined in the sentiment
that some one should be elected, and all
expressed a willingness to assist in bring
ing about such a desirable result.
Up to this point all were agreed, and it
was also at this point that they ceased
to agree. Stratton, on behalf of General
relief of John C. Pelton arose in the i
Senate once more, and, after a struggle, '
slipped through. It was beaten at first, |
but under a motion to reconsider, made i
under a suspension of the rules, the Sen- ;
ate became more liberal and the bill was
passed. It appropriates $1000 for Pelton
because he established the first free pub
lic school in the State.
The act is entitled an act "to repay to
reimburse John C. Pelton for money ex- i
pended and services rendered" in estab- |
fishing the school mentioned.
During the final rollcall Braun
hart demanded that some one ex
plain what services had been rendered
and what the claim was for, anyway.
There was no explanation, however, and
out of sheer unwillingness to vote "no '
the Senators let it go. Davis voted 'aye
and Rowell voted "no" on the Pelton ;
resolution, but a few minutes before they j
were objecting to the spending of money ;

SENATE REIMBURSES
i CLAUS SPRECKEL3
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 17.â bill ap
propriating $25,000 to pay the claim of
Claus Spreckels against the State for
money advanced to aid the drought
stricken districts of the State was passed
by the Senate this evening by a unani
mous vote. When the cry first went up
for assistance from the State there was
no money available, and. as money was
the first consideration, the starving peo
ple were no nearer assistance than a
promise to do something when the Legis
lature should meet, months later. It was
then that Claus Spreckel;uÂ»ame forward
with an offer of $50,000 In i\sh. His offer
of money was gladly accepted by those
in charge of the work of relief, but it was
decided to take only $25,000. To this Mr.
Spreckels agreed, intimating, however,
that the other $25,000 was ready at any
time they wished to call for it.
The money was at once started on its
mission of relief, and $13,000- of the amount
was expended before the work was finally
completed. The remaining $12,000 is still
on hand. When the money was handed
over Mr. Spreckels made no conditions.
He said he would trust to the State, to
pay it back, but there was no agreement
of that nature. The bill just passed by
the Senate was introduced for the pur-

druggists refund the money if it falls to cure.
25c. The genuine has L. B. Q. on each tablet.
Barnes, suggested that aii of the present
candidates withdraw from the contest.
This having been done, a caucus should
be held, the caucus agreement being that
the. names of none of the present candi
dates be considered. Having gone into
caucus under this agreement, the caucus
could and would select some new man as
the choice of the party for Senator.
This proposition provoked a prolonged
debate, which made apparent the fact
that while ail were willing that a Sen
ator should be elected they were at the
same time unwilling that the lucky man
should be other than the man they are
now voting for. The old arguments that
have been thrashed over a thousand times
since the beginning of the session were
trotted out and aired anew, but Dis
proved convincing only to those who ad
vanced them.
After these tactics had been pursued for
an hour it became apparent to all that
no agreement could be reached and that
those who were engaging in the discus
sion with the best intentions in the world
were only wasting their time. Having
reached this conclusion those present
agreed to adjourn with the understanding
that no agreement concerning the vexed
question before them was possible, and
that the only thing left to do was to go
back to their candidates with the infor
mation that the Legislature must adjourn
without electing a Senator. This under
standing is accepted as the only possible
solution of the question.
] pose of giving back to Mr. Spreckels the
! amount he so generously and so willingly
! turned over to the State.

ward O'Brien, which recently went ashore
near this port, was sold on the 2d inst.
tion the Government was actuated not
only by the fact that the Princess had
been in turn heir presumptive and heir
apparent to the Hawaiian throne, but
by anxiety to recognize the loyalty and I
discretion displayed by Kaiulani under
the changed circumstances of her life,
and the zeal she exhibited as the asso- :
ciate of Mrs. Dole and Mrs. Sewall in
the Red Cross Society and other or
ganizations for the benefit of her peo- ;
ple, i
On Wednesday the body lay in state
at Ainahau. It was a sad and solemn
but picturesque and impressive func
tion, made doubly so by the mournful |
wailing and mele singing of hundreds
of Hawaiian voices, with throats or
hats bedecked with maile or the
orange-colored illma leis. Throughout
the day the wide avenues and ap
proaches were filled with a never end
ing throng of all classes, and conditions
of society, from the highest officials to
the lowest serf. Under the grand ban
yan tree in front of the entrance lania
were seated dark-robed and flower
crowned Hawaiians chanting meles and
the hei Inoas. At the principal doors
were stationed in full uniform with
craped arms the officers of Company Q
of the National Guard of Honolulu, and |
a lieutenant of police to point out the ;
way to the mourners. In a small re
ception room sat the gray-haired and
stately Queen PUll>gui Kopioiani, sur- I
rounded by her suite and the chief
mourners, while the bereaved father
wept in privacy.
In the main reception room the som- j
ber aspects of gloom was relieved by,
immense numbers and varieties of
white and bright colored flowers. In
the center had been reared a massive
catafalque, gracefully covered with a
royal pall of purple and gold and the
royal spread of Queen Liliuokalani.
Upon this rested the body of the
beautiful dead clad In pure white robes j
of satin. The face, lightly covered by
a veil, was beautiful, and with a most j
lovable expression. At the head was j
a crown of white carnations on a gold- j
en colored cushion, and close to it an- i
other crown of maile and illma. Around j
the neck was a lei mam*) of the j
feathers of the small yellow bird of that
name and worn only by those of royal i
Hawaiian blood. Scattered over the |
catafalque were rare purple and white
orchids and fragrant orange blossoms.
At the four corners of the bier were !
the large white kalulls of the dead j
Princess and two bjack ones of the
Queen Dowager, while around the room
were others of different sizes and color.
The room was relieved < with beautiful
ferns,' palms and flowering shrubs,
and a large portrait of Kaiulani, coy- j
ered with white flowers, stood In , one
corner. *.
Every two hours, day and night, six I
ladies alternated with the same number j
of gentlemen in gently waving the |
feather kahilis over the body. At the I
head in full uniform stood the military â¢
guard of honor of the officers of the j
President's staff Colonel Soper, Major
Potter and Captains Pratt and Garten- i

HONOLULU, March 10.â All the Chinese
in quarantine whose permits from the old
Hawaiian Government are in good form
will be allowed to land In Honolulu With
out delay. This is the final decision by
the Treasury Department at Washington
received in a short dispatch by Special
Agent Brown. The dispatch requests
that the decision be submitted to the
Hawaiian Government at once for Its
guidance.
Agent Brown's dispatch is short and to
the point. The instructions mean that all
Chinese holding permits from the Ha
waiian Government issued up to the time
of Mr. Brown's arrival here may come in.
Annexation and the flag raising on Au
gust 12 are ignored in dealing with the
matter. As no permits of any kind were
issued after the arrival of Mr. Brown the
situation is that all Chinese who bars

conditional permits may come back.

j Collector General of Customs. She was
j heir presumptive to the throne and on
March 9, 1891, on the accession of Queen
â â  Liliuokalani, was proclaimed heir ap

i lotted to her. Full of thoughtful am
: bition she studied hard to tit herself
for the exalted position and her pleas

! able friends. But just as she was reach
ing her legal majority the fell hand of
the political destroyer dashed her hopes
to the ground by overthrowing the
monarchy, and her death of a broken
heart must be laid at their doors.
In 1893 she visited Washington in
company w \,th her guardian, where she
issued an appeal to the people of the
United States. She returned to -Hawaii
on November 9, 1897, and has scrupu
lously and religiously abstained from
any political interference in the affairs
of her country. Her reception by her
own people and the foreigners was
most cordial. In social life she strove

ALASKANS WILL
BE ENUMERATED
Plans for a Complete
Census.
TWO DISTRICTS LAID OUT
MEN FAMILIAR WJTH THE TER
RITORY TO BE CHOSEN.
It Is Thought That the Population
in the New Gold Lands
Has Been Vastly
Increased.
Special Dispatch .to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, March 17.
Preliminary arrangements for taking
a complete census of Alaska are now
under way, and work will begin as soon
as the spring season there opens. A
complete census of Alaska has never
been taken, and since the discovery of
gold there the population has greatly
increased. It is thought that when the
enumeration is completed the number
of Uncle Sam's subjects living in his
Alaskan possessions will be a matter
of surprise to the public. Heretofore
no systematic effort has been made to
secure the exact number of native pop
ulation, the figures being based mainly
on the number of residents of the vil
lages and towns, but in this instance
special attention will be paid to secur
ing a correct enumeration of the natives
of the country. The proposed census
will not only show the number of In
habitants, but their nationality, lan
guage spoken and the number of years
they have resided ln the country.
Mr. Wines, in speaking of the matter
to-day. said that the census bureau
would select two Intelligent and ener
getic men who are natives of Alaska,
or are at least familiar with the geo
graphical and domestic conditions of
the country, as chiefs of the two census
divisions in which Alaska has been di
vided. These two men. said Mr. Wines,
will be relied upon to select their as
sistants. A plan will be suggested to
the two chiefs of the divisions, however,
that in the selection of their co-workers
they endeavor to choose men residing
in the different sections of the country.
For instance, in the enumeration of the
inhabitants of the Klondike gold fields
a man who has spent some time in that
immediate part of the country and
knows its people should be taken for
the work. So, with the assistants be
ing confined to their respective locali
ties, it is proposed to wage a quick and
aggressive "summer campaign," and
by the opening of the winter season it
is hoped that each and every inhabitant
of that country will be properly regis
tered on the census rolls.
Mr. Dunham, chief of the labor bu
reau of Alaska, and Mr. Ivey, Collector
of Customs for that country, spent- the
greater part of the day in conference
with Frederick M. Wines, assistant di
rector of the twelfth census, discussing
the means of performing the work of
enumeration. Both of these gentlemen
have spent several years in Alaska, and
are thorough"*' familiar with the most
desirable method of taking the census
there. , 'i-f'i'f-
Wines stated to-day that the sug
gestions offered by these two gentle
men would be -followed out.'as-far as
was practicable. It is thought that
twenty-five men will be a % sufficient
force for carrying on the work. These
men will be selected from persons who
are now residents of Alaska and know
the country and the habits of the peo
ple Taking the Alaskan census will,
according to the statement of Ivey and
Dunham, be attended with great diffi
culty The country is very sparsely
settled and Its inhabitants, especially
in the Interior, are a roving class.
On account of the severe climate the
work will necessarily be 'confined to the
summer months. The enumeration will
commence about the latter part of April
and it is hoped will be completed by
the middle of September. Alaska will
be divided into two census districts, and
twelve enumerators, under the direc
tion of a chief, will be assigned 16 each
section The first division will be
known as the Yukon district and will
embrace all the territory adjacent to
that river and its tributaries. In th s
district will also be included the Ameri
can side of the Klondike gold fields.
The second district will be known a.
the Kuskoklmlm Division, and will In
clude that section of \ Alaska through
which this river flows and all parts
lying south of it. The Aleutian Islands
will also be embraced in this division.

VANCOUVER, B. C. March 17.â The

Is a hoax. The steamer Cutch arrived to

mor of trouble anywhere In the north

eral times advanced over the lines of the
boundary Is. they say. also without foun
dation. No such name as Carl Slummer
feldt appears on the published list of the
passengers of the steamer Tees.

AMERICANS" FIGHTING AGAINST THE FILIPINOS
OTIS EXPECTS THE
INSURRECTION TO
COLLAPSE SOON
Advices Received at Washington
' Indicate That the Rebels Will
Be Struck a Decisive Blow.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel.
Washington, March 17.
There was much reluctance shown at
the War Department to-day to discuss
a cable dispatch from General Otis re
ceived during the day, and which was
regarded as most important by those
who read it as indicating that hostil
ities might cease very suddenly in the
Philippines and a collapse of the insur
rection come at any time.
The reasons for the belief of General
Otis that a climax might come at any
hour were not stated, but his assump
tion v. as based on the favorable reports
he had received from various sources
that the Filipinos were tired of the war
and of A-uinaldo's leadership. It is
believed at the War Department that
the method in which the Americans
have ducted the fighting has done
much tb convince the Filipinos of the
uselesshe_.s of trying to drive out the
United States forces. The fighting has
been of a different character from that
to which they were accustomed when
the Spaniards were in possession of
Manila.
General Otis' cablegram,. has caused
a great deal of gratification. It was
sent to the President at Thomasville.
The preparations that have been under
way to send further . troops and sup
plies to the Philippines have net been
stopped, however. The light batteries
which General Otis requested in the
cable of last night will be sent, as they
may be useful in future operations and
in case of disturbances in distant parts
of the island.
The news, that an insurrection has
also broken out at Leyte, while a sub
ject of considerable interest, does not
worry the War- Department people, who
say these outbreaks of savagery in the
lesser islands are always liable to. occur
until Luzon has been subjugated.
It may not be necessary to send troops
to the island of Leyte. but if matters
there become serious Colonel James F.
Smith of the First California, now at
Negros, may be dispatched, as his
troops are nearest the scene of dis
turbance. Leyte Is southeast of Luzon.
It is one of the Visayan. group, lying
next to Cebu and not far from Negros
and Par.ay, on the latter of which Iloilo
is situated. â¢ <* '-" 'â -.â '

that a British gunboat has gone to

DROVE THE
FILIPINOS
BEFORE THEM
Rapid Victories of American
Forces at Manila and
Vicinity.
MANILA. '* Feb. 13.â The stirring
events of the past week have followed
each other in such rapid succession that
it is a difficult matter to arrange them
chronologically, much less relate them
in detail. The number of troops en
gaged and the amount of territory Cov
ered by the American forces as they
have swept everything before them
since the outbreak of hostilities with
the rebellious natives add to the diffi
culty very materially.
That trouble with Aguinaldo's -forces
encamped outside the city was immi
nent and inevitable had been apparent
ever since the rebel leader issued his
proclamation demanding independence,
but the American authorities had
averted it so often by the exercise of
such rare discretion and illimitable pa
tience that until the first blood had
been shed no one really believed that
it had come, and that the breach was
irreparable. .
All day on the fatal 4th- of February
there had been rumors of the receipt by
Aguinaldo of messages from his Washing
ton representative, Agoncillo, counseling
action immediately if he desired to avert
the ratification of the peace treaty; but
no one paid much attention to them,
since it was known that only forty-eight
hours remained before the. Senate would
act. Other rumors and the sudden disap
pearance of native servants about the
same time were also discussed indiffer
ently, but no alarm was created there
by and there was the usual Saturday
night bustle in the city up to the time
the stores closed.
About 9 o'clock, however, bugles com
menced to BOund the call "To arms" in
various directions, mounted orderlies flew
along the streets, soldiers rushed out .of j
the theaters, saloons and various . place's
of amusement, and suddenly the unmis
takable rattle of musketry, punctuated
occasionally by the boom of artillery,
startled the entire, city,. .Emergency or
ders having already been issued to the
commanding officers of the various regi
ments, the main streets were soon echo
ing to the march of thousands of Ameri
can soldiers, who were overjoyed at the i
Idea of "going to the front" at last, while
squads of others, told off for police duty,
were stationed on the side streets ready
for anything which might turn up.
Meantime the outposts, miles away,
were busily engaged in holding their
friends, the enemy, In check. The trouble
commenced at 8:45 o'clock, when three
Filipinos crossed the line at Santa Mesa
with the deliberate Intention of drawing
our fire. Twice they had been warned,
and as often fled back to their own line;*
but the third time they tried the expert-]
ment a Nebraska corporal, to whom the
matter had been reported, fired upon the;
trio, dropping oije and wounding another.
Scarcely pad the. echo of his shots died

man. The United States would, it is
said, make no objection to the English
taking action in Such a case were it not
that it would establish a precedent for
other nations to interfere. Consequent
ly it is believed that the action of the
gunboat will be limited to pacific in
terference or that a special understand
ing as to its mission has been reached
with- Admiral Dewey.
Unofficial advices say that an attack
has been made on the volunteer troops
north of Manila, comprising the bri
gade of General H. G. Otis, probably
with the view of ascertaining whether
his lines had been weakened by with
drawing men for the operations at
Pasig. The rebels soon discovered Otis
in force and fell back. General Otis
this morning- reports one American
killed and ' one wounded at Caloocan,
probably as a result of this attack.
Aguinaldo, it is now learned, is not
at Malolos, his capital, but is only a
short distance in the rear of the rebel
troops now facing General H. G. Otis.
He is said to visit the front daily and
to be received with enthusiasm. His
presence there increases . the chances
that he may be surrounded and cap

a. native darted out of one dark doorway
into another, like a rabbit; but from the
moment the soldiers emerged from their
barracks, armed for the tray, not a ve
hicle of any description was to be found
In any direction.
By 10 o'clock, when the rebels again
opened fire, the Americans were lined up
as follows: On the left flank was Major
General Mac Arthur's division, stretching
from the Chinese cemetery to Santa Mesa.
It comprised the Twentieth Kansas, First
Nebraska, First Montana, Tenth Penn
sylvania, First South Dakota Volunteers,
two batteries of the Utah Light Artillery
and the Third Artillery, acting as infan
try. These were divided Into two brig
ades under Brigadier Generals Harrison
Gray Otis and Hale. In the cenfer,
stretching from Santa Mesa to Paco, were
the First Idaho, First Washington and
First California Volunteers under Briga
dier General Charles King; while on the
right was Major General T. M. Ander
son's, division, which included the First
Nbrth Dakota 7 Volunteers, Fourth Cav
alry, Sixth Artillery and Fourteenth In
fantry Regulars. In the city the Second
Oregon and Thirteenth Minnesota.Volun
teers and Twenty-third Infantry main
tained order, guarded the Spanish pris
oners and furnished the necessary re
serves; while the First Tennessee Volun
teers guarded the water front.
Of the other regiments in the Philip
pines the First Wyoming and Fifty-first
lowa Volunteers were at Cavlte, support
ing the California Heavy Artillery, and
the Eighteenth Infantry and part of the
Sixth Artillery were at Iloilo. Two com
panies of the Tenth Pennsylvania Volun
teers were doing guard duty at Corregi
dor Island.
During the night there were several
skirmishes with the enemy, who were ap
parently concentrated at Caloocan, the
Chinese cemetery and Santa Mesa; and
frequent brushes occurred In the vicinity
of Paco. In all their previous battles
with the Spaniards the Filipinos had in
variably fought in this desultory way
during the darkness and been left to rest
all day; but with the dawn the entire
American line commenced to advance,
and after recovering from their surprise
at. this unexpected move the rebels at
tempted to give them battle. .
While much ammunition had been
wasted during the night owing to their
inability to see the enemy, the Ameri
cans made amends for it when daylight
disclosed the rebel lines, hundreds of na
tives being mowed down when the men
steadied down to volley firing. The en
emy's fire, always ragged and desultory,
gradually became more and more feeble,
until it was simply individual "potting'
at various points of the line. Then, when
the Americans received thi- order to ad
vance and the long blue line started on
the doublequick for them, cheering as
only lusty Americans can cheer, the en
emy's line wavered, fell back and they
ran for dear life. Here, there and every
where individuals sought shelter behind
trees-, stones and in the jungle, and died
fighting to the last gasp; \ but the main
body, like chaff before a gale, was swept
but of sight In all directions. Detach
ments, upon reaching villages and other
places of comparative refuge, made
stands and held the victors in check tem
porarily, but it was only for a little while,
and those who survived sped on, leaving
the house's to be burned by their relent
less pursuers. The result was that by
Sunday at noon the enemy in sight were
the dead and dying and a few hundred
prisoners. While all this was transpiring
ashore the navy was by no means idle.
The monitor Monadnock, stationed off
Malate. used her four-Inch guns upon the
rebel trenches with marked effect, occa
sionally letting go a ten-Inch shell by way
of reminder as to what she could do if
she tried. V
At the other end of the line the Con
cord Callao and Leyte beat tattoos with
their quick-firing guns, which poured a
hail of lead into the trenches near Caloo
can. ~ __ â  â â¢;'â 'â .

are much reduced in numbers owing to
desertions. Should this result be
reached the bottom would be knocked
out of the revolution. The only thing

HAZE MADE
INSANE BY
SICKNESS
Alleged Traitor Was a
Physical and Mental
Wreck.
If the man who is reported to have
deserted his colors and met death in
the ranks of the Filipinos is former
Corporal Henry F. Haze he is an Eng
lishman and not. very well known in
this city; "though he has lived here off
aftd on for some yearn amd a - mar
ried "sister living - here- He, was an
itinerant sort of a fellow' and followed
the sea prior to his enlistment in the
army. Haze has served term's in the
United States navy and has made two
or three trips to the Arctic in the whal
ing service. r â  â¢
"I knew Corporal Haze very well,"
said one of the officers of the First Reg
iment, who recently returned from Ma
nila. "Judging from the condition he
was in when I last saw him Haze would
be liable to do almost anything. He
was a perfect wreck from dysentery
and fever and was drinking very heav
ily. There is very little doubt in my
mind that Haze was dot in his right
mind if he deserted. Perhaps he may
have been discharged from our regi
ment and then enlisted in the Filipino
ranks as an officer. I know that a
commission had been offered him by an
officer of the Filipino forces who was
high in authority, but I can hardly con
ceive of his accepting it unless he had
been discharged from our army.
"As a soldier Haze had no peer in the
regiment. I had charge of Colonel
Smith's boat and it was my duty to
select two men from several companies
to man the boat. After giving Haze
one trial I always made it a point to
choose him as one of the boat's crew.
He understood his business as a boat
man thoroughly and was careful and
conscientious about his work.
"He was fairly well educated and in
leisure moments he was wont to tell
me of his experiences aboard ship. He
also told me that he had , a married
sister living in San Francisco. He
wrote to her quite frequently.
"Haze was a wild, dare-devil sort of
a chap. One night when off duty he*
was walking down one of the streets
of Manila when he met a few of the
Minnesota boys who were preparing to
raid a gambling den. . Haze saw an
opportunity to have a free-for-all .flght
and he Joined with the Minnesota boys
in their -raid. When the fracas' was
over Haze was found lying on the floor
with two or three of his ribs broken
and a deep knife wound in his arm.
Shortly: afterward he was taken sick,
and when I left there Haze was a phy
sical and almost a mental wreck.
"The last time I saw him was two or
three days before I left. I met him
crossing, the Puenta Colgante bridge.
He was Intoxicated, and when I advised
him to quit drinking he told me the
doctors had ordered brandy and he was
only drinking to regain his health. He
was given to association with native
women. > I never knew of any' woman in
particular he would have been likely to
marry. He was a man who would be
liable to do most anything but desert
the flag and raise his arms against its
protectors. }'" ' -
"Haze was not the only man in the
regiment who was offered a commission
in the Filipino army. At the time of
which I speak there were no signs of
warfare between our army and the
Filipinos and overtures were made to
induce several of our discharged men
to join their forces. Knowing what I
do of Haze I feel safe in saying that he
received' his discharge from our army
before he joined the Filipinos."

NEWS THAT
HASN'T BEEN
CENSORED
Inability to Estimate the
Numbers and Resources
of Filipinos.
VIEWS AS TO STRIFE
Englishmen Think That Extermina
tion of Tagallos Is the Only .
Way to End the War.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONGKONG, March 17.â The follow
ing general view of the situation is
from a correspondent of the Associated
Press at Manila, and has not been sub
jected to censorship:
The most remarkable feature of the
situation is the inability of the Americans
and residents to estimate the numbers,
resources and plans of the Filipinos.
Prominent generals say that two or three
disastrous battles will break their spirit
and make terms. .
The English and Other residents are of
the opinion that the. extermination of the
Tagallos is the only guarantee of peace:
that" they- can nrsritj^-fbc-wÃlppea^trtney
give battle, but that they will dodge a
meeting with the American forces. Some
people think they will risk battles at
Malabon and Paranque, for they are
strongly intrenched, and if they are de
feated they will' resume bushwhacking as
long as any of them are left. "
United States Consul Williams says:
"I don't expect to live to see the end of
the war."
The rebels shift about so much that it
is impossible to estimate their numbers.
The correspondent questioned several of
the generals as to the number of the
rebels, and the replies ranged from 20,000
to 100,000. The estimates of the quantity
of arms possessed by the rebels are
equally uncertain. The best authorities
say 30,000. Large sections of the armed
natives are Ignorant of the use of their
weapons.
The country beyond the American
picket lines is rice fields, cane and brush.
The rebels are familiar with the hiding
places. The residents say the Tagallos are
unanimously rebels, and they predict the
Americans will be resisted at Mindoro
and Mindanao and that they will be
obliged to subdue them. : 7 - â 
The extent of the support which the
other Luzon tribes are giving Aguinaldo
Is a mystery. It is known that several
regiments were under arms before the
outbreak, and a majority of them are
supposed to be jealous of the Tagallos,
who are reported to be treating the other
tribes in the fashion of the Spaniards,
dominating the Island and holding all the
offices. - _ . ' __,'
Reports from the rebels are to the effect
that the recent tactics of the Americans
in retiring to their established lines after
pursuing makes the rebels think they are
winning a victory. The Oriental charac
ter is so deceptive that the residents of
Manila are Ignorant as to whether their
own servants sympathize wii.* the rebels
or not. It is known that a rebel organi
zation exists in the city, and the evidence
is growing that there was a widespread
plot to assassinate the Americans, the
signal being the commencement of hostil
ities. The servants were instructed to kill
their employers, but they were terrorized
by the vengeance dealt out to offenders,
and they weakened. Every Tagallo would
have cut his employer's throat If he dared,
or at least this is a current saying.
The faithlessness of the natives is illus
trated by the action of the commissioners
who came here to offer the allegiance of
the Island of Negros. It Is now known
that they were In friendly communication
with Aguinaldo while here.
The rebels have been resupplied with
ammunition and are using smokeless
powder. Nearly every house here dis
plays a foreign flag for protection.. All
flags except the Spanish flag are seen.
Natives working In the fields, plant a
white flag on a bamboo as a protection
against being mistaken for active rebels.
Every hut between the city and the
American line is a heap of ashes.
The residents are I the chief sufferers
from the present state of affairs. Food
commodities have doubled and trebled in
prices and many lines of business are at
a standstill. After 7 o'clock in the even
ing a deathlike silence prevails In the city
except for the footsteps of the sentries
or their challenges as an occasional civil
ian is halted. Each sentry calls upon the
passing civilians to explain their business.
The shutters are all. closed for fear of
shootings occurlng on the streets and the
theaters, restaurants and stores are also
closed. Uniformed Spanish officers In the
public places sneeringly say, "It would
be different If we were in control."
As an instance of the nervous tension
prevailing it Is cited that when the sunset
gun was fired on Sunday a whole regi
ment encamped on the Luneta jumped
for Its arms as if at the word of com
mand. ' -'â 
About 300 new saloons have been opened
here since the. American occupation with
the result that many drunken soldiers are
to be seen in the streets. The officers,
however, say the conduct of the soldiers
is better than that of any other nation
under similar circumstances. -
The chief topic of conversation at pres
ent is the delay in assigning Major Gen
eral Lawton to a command. Everybody
expected that he was to take command of
the troops and he is eager to get to work
but he has been a spectator of all the
week's fighting and his staff and. 10-year
old son have been exposed to the hottest
fire. There is an Impression that Japa
nese firms are supplying the rebels with
arms. The Japanese papers are urging
Japanese mediation. â¢ " I *>V lfa

Â WASHINGTON, March 17.â Official
news 'Of the action at Madrid was not
conveyed to the State Department be
fore the close of the department for the
day. M. Cambon called at the depart-,
ment about ten minutes to 4 o'clock
and in the absence of Secretary Hay
called upon Assistant Secretary Hill.
He told the latter that he believed the
treaty had been signed. It seems now
probable that to the Embassador will
be confided the honor of closing up the
task which he set about seven months
ago, that of bringing the two great
nations, then at war, to a state of
peace. Usually the rule is for a nation
situated as is Spain to send a special
envoy charged with the duty of ex
changing the ratifications, but a good
reason for accepting again the French
Embassador's offices in this last func
tion would be the saving of time.
The signing of the treaty cannot in
any manner affect the status of the
Spanish prisoners in the hands of
Aguinaldo, for the United States Gov
ernment is doing all that it can to se
cure their release. Still it is appre
hended that the Spanish Government,
being able to address itself ' directly to
the United States Government as soon
as the ratifications, are exchanged, will

SPARED NO
WOUNDED
Story Told by Private Tom
Lynch of the Third
,; i: ;; â ;.;. ;, Artillery. â ;â 
These extracts are from a graphic ,
letter written by Private Tom Lynch
of the Third Artillery, but a California
boy, to his father, Timothy Lynch of
this city. Private Lynch is on duty
aboard one of the gunboats engaged in
patrolling the Pasig from Manila to
Laguna de Bai. He writes:
"On Tuesday we were lying opposite
General Otis' headquarters, when a
9:30 o'clock we heard scattering re
ports of Mausers. Ten minutes later
there came the roar of a volley of mus
ketry which was heard all over Manila.
It came from the direction of the Ne
braska Regiment outposts. A small
body of insurgents had attempted to
cross San Juan bridge and .was driven
back. It returned with reinforcements,
and the second volley followed its at
tack upc-n the line. A few seconds after
the second report every regiment in
Manila was lined up outside its. quar
ters, waiting impatiently for the signal
to move. This came presently in th
shape of a red rocket, to indicate that
the outposts were attacked. And of
all the cheering you ever heard in your
life! It showed that every soldier in
Manila was 'Just dying' for a chance
to get at the black devils.
"The Americans reached the outposts
and held them until morning, waiting
for daylight. The insurgents kept firing
all night. The next morning the Amer
icans charged over the trenches, and
swept everything before them. Our
boat then steamed up to the firing line
and started to shell the towns on the
river. We struck Santa Ana, the insur
gent headquarters, first, and after an
ho-ur's hot work we had the town in
flames and what was left of the Fili
pinos running like frightened sheep. â 
"When we stopped shelling Santa Ana
the First California Regiment entered,
and what we had not burned they fin
ished with a vengeance. Their motto,
as well as that of the other regiments,
is: 'The only good Filipino is a dead
one; take no prisoners, as lead is
cheaper than rice.'
"We next commenced shelling a con
vent where the insurgents were quar
tered opposite the Nebraska camp, and
they all surrendered to the infantry
which was following us. All around
Manila could be heard heavy firing, and
Dewey opened up at Malate, which sur
rendered in about ten minutes. It was
a rather noisy time, especially on our
gunboat, where two mountain Hotch
kiss, two Krupp and four Gatling guns,
together with about forty Krag-Jorgen
sens, were in : action all at once. At
times we could hardly see one another
through the powder smoke. We could
tell, though, by the sound and by the
regularity of the volley firing that our
boys were giving them hades, and could
see that the Americans in : the other
part of town were pursuing the same
course as we â that is, burning every
thing around them. :yy -.
"The Tennessee men were on the
right, and an orderly came aboard and
reported that they were . killing every
native in sight, whether a soldier or
not. We were then recalled by General
Otis and had to remain in front of the
palace, guarding it, while the rest _of
the' boys were enjoying themselves
shooting 'niggers' on the run. ff x.
"All along the river we could see
the corpses of the natives lying on the
banks or floating down the river. The
Idahos at one place were burying the
natives,, and at one hole I saw them
throw in sixty-five bodies. We met the
First California, again further up, and
sawAlfy Bigelow and Jim Mclnerny ;
on the beach. I learned that Joe
Maher -was killed. . -.:
"Our own battery and regiment did
! not neglect to press the matter upon
the .attention of the State Department
and will perhaps solicit authority to re
sume direct, negotiations with the in
surgents looking ,to the. release of the
prisoners. If : the Spanish Government
: should insist some disagreeable ques
tions may be raised, involving the for
mal ' recognition of the insurgents by
Spain, in which case, perhaps. It might
claim the right to deal : directly with,
Aguinaldo.
Contrary to an expectation that
i seems to have obtained in some quar
ters,, the signing of the treaty does not
; involve the immediate discharge of
all the volunteer soldiers. â¢ It was stated
* positively at the State Department
' that, legally, the treaty; does not go into
j effect until the ratifications have been
exchanged and it will further be neces
sary for the President to proclaim it
I before the people of the United States,
> including the soldiers, before it can be
, known officially that the war is over. .
In all other aspects, however, the
! State Department will treat the war as
' at an end.
It is believed here that a new Span
i ish Minister will come prepared imme
diately after making the exchange of
I ratifications to institute negotiations for
a treaty of trade, commerce and amity,
the old treaty having been nullified by
the outbreak of the war.
One of the first duties of the officials
of the War Department who are
charged with the administration of the
! customs affairs of the insular posses
i sions of the United States will be to
I prescribe regulations to give effect to
the pledge of the United States to af-
I ford Spanish commerce with the Philip
j pines and the West Indies favored

not do much Saturday night, but the
next morning they made one of the
grandest charges of history. They
charged a cemetery that was full of
natives, and piled them up till you
couldn't count the dead. They say our
major bears a charmed life. He rode
at the head of the column, urging the
men forward and telling them to spare
not even the wounded, thrusting his
own sword through every wounded in
surgent he passed.
"On Monday noon the Wyoming men
captured a block house and found con
cealed under the floor two fine Krupp
guns of the latest pattern and six
boxes â¢ f shells. . Where the Filipinos
got these guns nobody seems to know,
but many are of the opinion they were
supplied by the Germans.
"The Spanish residents. here deserve
great credit for the way they sympa
thized, with tho Americano, BV(*n prninfl
so- far., as to place their .private j car
riages at the disposal of .the- soldiers
for the carrying in of the .wounded".
The California regiment is having' a
swell time at the expense of the Fili
pinos, dining three times a day on
chicken, which they get by foraging,
and riding up and down the beach in
flne rigs, exercising the . captured
horses." - .

HEART WEAKNESS.
Is your heart weak? Do you have the
symptoms of heart weakness? If you
tmve. you should be careful. The heart
s the most vital organ of the body. It is
'he engine that propels the muscles and
-ends sustenance to the nerves and brain
.nd to all the organs of the body. A
Saw in its mechanism is certain to give
rise to serious results. Weakness denotes
'.he presence of a flaw. It is a fore-

A BURNING HOTEL
THE WINDSOR
THE SCENE OF
A HOLOCAUST
Flames Rapidly Spread, and a
Score of Lives k-ost and Twice
T V': 7
That Number Injured.
Special Dispatch to The CalL '\ Â«-l *S \ 5? -
NEW YOR, March 17.â Flames which
originated from the _ siting of a lace
curtain burst forth from the second
floor of the Windsor Hotel at Forty
seventh street and Fifth avenue, short
ly after 3 o'clock this afternoon, just
as the St. Patrick's day parade was
passing the building, and in a few mo
ments they had leaped to the roof and
enveloped the entire Fifth avenue and
Forty-seventh street fronts of the ho
t*i â -
Ten minutes later the flames were
roaring through the interior of the ho
tel.-and all escape by means of stair
ways and elevators was cut off. There
- was the wildest scene of excitement.
Hundreds of guests and employes
were in the hotel when the fire broke
out, 'and for many of them escape was
impossible. Probably from fen to fif
teen lives were lost within half an hour,
and from thirty to "forty persons were
injured by jumping from windows and
rushing through the roaring flames in
the corridors and on the stairways.
Many who were injured died later in
near-by residences and at hospitals,
and others who made wild leaps to the
â  stone sidewalks were so badly injured
that they are still hovering between life
and death. It may be twenty-four
hours or more before the complete List
of fatalities becomes known, and it will
be longer than that before it can be as
certained definitely how many charred
bodies are in the mass of fallen ma
. sonry that marks the spot where the
hotel stood.
The flames could not be checked and
iii two hours from the time the fire
broke out the entire structure was in
ruins and the streets on three sides of
the building were filled with debris
from fallen wails and chimneys, while
the streams of water being poured upon
the interior of the ruins had no other
effect than to fill the air with clouds
of scalding steam, making it impossi
ble for any one to approach near
who U perished arCh for the bodi
who perished.
The fire was the most spectacular
that could be imagined. When it broke
out Fifth avenue was crowded with
â¢people watching the St. Patrick's day
parade and every window in the front
of the hotel facing Fifth avenue was
filled with spectators.
â ' \s <=oon as the flames were discov
ered shooting from the windows, that
part of the procession which wad near
the building came to a halt and in a
few minutes the parade was disbanded,
for the police came rushing toward the
fire from every direction and where
' they were able drove the people from
the streets, one fire alarm after an
ther was turned in. The engines
â¢caused a wild scramble among tne pa
â¢raders and spectators as they rushed
along the street and fell into position
for service. . . .
In addition to the regular guests of
the hotel the windows were crowded by
' a large number of spectators, residents
of thfs city, who had congregated there
to* witness the parade.
Soon after the first alarm was given
people in the lower floors of the hotel
{hose who had easy access to the street
â¢htd thp stairway commenced to pour
out of the building in great numbers
hut it very soon became apparent that
a great majority of the occupants of
the hotel were either panic stricKen or
unable to make their way to the ground
â¢?Â°W_ndows were thrown up on every
side of She building, and guests most
lywomen, in all stages of terror made
â¢ their appearance and uttered frantic
anneals for assistance to the crowd be
fow As the flames gathered about
'them they became more and more ter
ror stricken and presently some of them
â¢stood uoon the narrow windox. sills
â  and beckoned to the spectators that
they were about to leap. The men col
lected on the sidewalks ready to ren
der any stance they could, and in
. the meantime some of *c women MR
the window sills and dropped to the
street. In most instances the efforts
'to catch them and break their awful
'all were unavailing, for they struck
the sidewalk and in most cases broken
limbs were the result. As soon as the
firemen could get their scaling ladders
into position they climbed the sides of
the building and entered at every win
dow where there was an unfortunate
guest appealing for assistance, and
many cases of heroic rescue were wit
nessed by the throng in the streets.
At the corner of Forty-seventh street
and Seventh avenue, directly across
from the hotel, is the home of Miss
Helen Gould, and at her direction many
of the injured were carried there and
were treated by physicians and nurses
whom she had sent for. In the mean
time the Chief of Police had telephoned
to every hospital in the city asking
that assistance be sent. " Ambulances
forced their way through the crowds as
quickly as possible, and the injured
people who nad made the rrichtful
leaps from the hotel windows were.
placed in them and removed to the hos
pitals. fy- ,v--'-\
Several occupants of the hotel aD
peared at the windows of the sixth and
seventh stories ar.d even on the roof,
and leaped to the streets from those
points. Very few of them escaped either'
instant death or injuries which result
ed in their death in a short time later.
In the meantime the entire building
was being enveloped in flames, which
shot out from every window and
formed a picture which struck terror
to all those who were witnessing it.
Within forty or forty-five minutes af
ter the fire broke out the walls on the
Fifth avenue side showed every indi
cation of falling, and presently, with
an awful crash, they struck the as
phalt covering of the street ;n front
of the hotel and caused the hundreds
of people who were standing there to
scatter in every direction. This fall
weakened the walls on the Forty-sixth
and Forty-seventh street sides and
they followed a moment later. When
the walls fell he brick and mortar and
twisted girders and corrugated iron
filled the streets on three sides of the
hotel. V
The doorsteps and iron fences in
front of the houses on the opposite side
of the street from the hotel were
wrecked by the falling walls and the
amount of debris piled in the streets
was so great that travel will be im
peded for several days. The northeast
wing of the hotel continued to burn for
a half hour after the wails of the other
building fell. The firemen continued to
play streams upon the flames and on
the adjoining buildings, including Miss
Gould's residence, which seemed in im
minent danger of catching fire, but the
flames were brought under control be
fore'they could reach any of them.
There were many thrilling scenes in
the hotel during the early stages of the
fire. A hallboy discovered the flames
while he was passing alo-ng the fourth
floor, immediately over the rooms oc
cupied by President M Kinley's brother,
Abner McKinley. and his family. The
boy pulled a chain attached to the fire
alarm, but the chain broke, and then
he cried out an alarm of fire and ran
to the floor below. The blaze was then
licking up everything on the Fifth
avenue end of the building, and the lad,
when he got to the floor above the main
hall, ran into the American dining
room and gave the alarm to the guests
there. Only a few persons were in the
dining-room at the time and the;, es
caped. When the buy reached the main
floor Warren F. Leland, proprietor of
the hotel, was In the rear of the long
hall, and the boy shouted to him that
the building was on fire. On Mr. Le
land's instructions the clerks tried to
save all the books and papers, and the
boy then rushed down the basement
stairway and alarmed the women who
were at work in the laundry. It is
believed that all ef them escaped.
One of the most daring rescues made
by the firemen occurred on the fifth
floor on the Fifth-avenue front. An
elderly woman was seen at a window
and two firemen succeeded in reaching
the window immediately underneath.
One of them climbed to the coping of
when he got into the American dinins
and then swung the woman clear of the
window and landed her safely in the
arms of his companion, who, with the
assistance of "several other firemen,
pushed her down to the street.
The first horror occurred just fifteen
minutes after the fire broke out. A
handsome woman appeared at the win
dow of a room on the fourth floor. She
held out her arms to the crowd below.
Then she raised her hands as if in sup
plication and in a moment climbed to
the window ami leaped. She turned
about like a top and struck the iron
railing in front of the hotel. Her body
seemed to be impaled there, but it fell
off and into the area way. She was
dead. The woman was identified as
Mrs. Amelia Paddock of Irvington,
N. Y. . ;%*b:; v^:-;
One of the most thrilling scenes of
the fire at a time when the building
was a seething caldron of flame â was
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 18, 1599.
the heroic rescue of several women
from the upper stories. One had been
carried down from the fifth story. Mrs.
A. H. Fuller of Pittsburg, then appear
ed with her maid at the wind_pw of the
fourth story. It seemed an age before
the ladder was raised. Firemen ran
up and with great difficulty brought
down Mrs. Fuller and her maid. Just
as she was gotten out of the window, a
middle-aged woman appeared at- a
window just north of that at which the
ladder was placed. The woman, fear
ing she would not be rescued, prepared
to jump. She was warned to keep back
and became panic stricken and stepped
back into the dense smoke. Another
ladderman, seeing the desperate situa
tion of the woman, seized a scaling
ladder and went up story after story
through the blinding smoke. He climb
ed to the coping just as the woman re
appeared. Catching her by the waist
and holding tightly to the building, he
crept slowly on the coping and passed
the fainting woman to another fireman
who had braced himself to receive her.
There was a dreadful suspense as tho
fireman drew the woman toward him
and finally had her safely on the lad
der. A tremendous cheer went up from
the crowd. b" '-'.
Fireman John Hanna of the fireboat
Zephar Mills rushed through the smoke
to the top floor and found Night Watch
man McNicholl half asphyxiated. Han
na lowered him by means of wire to the
fire escape two stories below and let
himself down this way. His hands
were badly cut by the wire. Then
Hanna assisted the old man down the
fire escape. y'y.f
Fireman William Kennedy of Engine
Company No. 23 rescued Mrs. Brann
from the fourth floor of the hotel by
means of a scaling ladder. His rescue
was cheered by the immense crowd.
A crippled woman was found dying
on the floor of a room on the fourth
floor unable to move and was carried
in safety to the street.
.Assemblyman John H. Maher. Sheriff
Dunn and Police Commissioners Hess.
Sexton and Abell all assisted in taking
persons from the hotel. Capta!n Emit
H. Pate of Company L, Forty-seventh
United States Volunteers, rushed up to
the fourth floor and rescued an old
crippled man who- was partly asphyxi
ated by the smoke and burned.
Policeman Luke Miley rescued three
women from the fourth floor ar.d was
badly burned about the hands and face
and his uniform was nearly burned
from his back.
A Brooklyn fireman who came over
to see the parade, saw a woman on
the seventh story right over where the
fire occurred first. He rushed upstairs
and rescued Kate Flannlgan. a domes-'
tic. She was badly burned and injured
by falling debris and was unconscious
when brought down.
Thomas McPherson, an employe of
the Government docks in Brooklyn.
went through the fire and smoke and
rescued Mrs. R. Butler, who was un
conscious from shock and fright. Mc-
Pherson was so badly burned that he
had to be taken to the hospital him
self.
All of these rescues, and many others,
occurred within a period of a few min
utes. Meanwhile terrifying scenes were
being enacted by frenzied men and
women on almost every floor of the
great building. How many persons are
buried in the ruins is not known, but
at least three or four persons were seen
to jump whose bodies have not been
recovered. A young man. apparently
an employe. Jumped from the roof on
the Forty-sixth street side of the hotel.
Another unknown man jumped on th'"
Fifth avenue side and two more were
seen to jump from the rear. Shortly
after that two women jumped from the
roof to the court below.
It is known that two of these at least
are dead. Eyewitnesses say that they
saw a woman throw a child from a win
dow and fall a moment later herself,
just before the collapse of one of the
walls. As yet no trace of these bodies
have been found.
J. L. Morgan of Birmingham, Ala.,
who had been watching the parade
with a number of friends from the bal
cony, ran to the fourth floor and res
cued Mrs. Algernon Jarvis and her
daughter Mabel. He took them to the
balcony and thence they were taken to
the street by firemen.
Abner McKinley, a brother of Presi
dent McKinley, had four rooms on the
ground floor of the hotel. Mrs. Mc-
Kinley and her daughter, Mabel Me-
Kinley, occupied the rooms with Abner
McKinley. Miss Mabel McKinley had
ordered a coach for a drive at 3 o'clock
and was dressing for it when the alarm
of fire was given. She was in her dress
ing gown at the time. She .saw the
smoke and becoming frightened opened
the window and was assisted out by
some unknown man. She walked half
a block and found her carriage in wall
ing. She was driven to the Hotel Buck
ingham, where she telephoned to her
father, Abner McKinley, at his office,
30 Broad street.
Mrs. McKinley and her daughter,
Helene McKinley, were entertaining
Mrs. John Sherwood, the author. All
of them got out assisted by two men,
whom they do not know. The women
became separated, Mrs.. McKinley going
to the residence of Rev. Dr. Morgan at
3 East Forty-fifth street and Miss
Helene McKinley to the residence of
the banker, Richard T. Wilson, at 511
Fifth avenue. Finally all went to the
Manhattan Hotel, where there wa3 a

THE FIRE WAS DUE
TO GROSS CARELESSNESS
Patron of the Hotel Threw a Blazing
Match Into a Lace Cur
tain.
NEW YORK, March 17.â Regarding
the origin of the fire, the Herald will
to-morrow publish the following: John
Foy, a waiter in the hotel, was passing
through the hall on the parlor floor,
the first above the street. He was mak
ing his way into a place where he
could catch a moment's sight of the
parade In front of him walked a man
patron of the hotel. The waiter did
not know him. Passing thus, one be
hind the other, they had nearly gained
the angle of the passage near Fifth
avenue and Forty-sixth street, when
the patron drew a match and lighted
a cigar or cigarette. He tossed the
match aside. It was still blazing and
fell into the folds of a lace curtain. In
an instant the flimsy fabric was ablaze
and the flames shot to the surrounding
draperies. This, from all accounts, was
the origin of the holocaust in which
many human beings perished and oth
ers were severely mangled, while help
less thousands looked on in wild horror.
One Victim a Society Leader.
CINCINNATI, March 17.â Mrs. John
M Gibson, one of the victims of the
Windsor Hotel fire in New York, was
well known here as a society leader.
Her husband belonged to a prominent
family that owns the Gibson House
and other valuable property here. They
lived in New York during the winter
and at the seashore during the summer.
Mrs Gibson was a daughter of George
W. Goodhue and belonged to a promi
nent family.
FRENCH NAVY WAS
UNPREPARED FOR WAR
PARIS, March 17.â 1n the Chamber of!
Deputies to-day. during the debate on the j
i naval estimates. M. Lockroy, Minister of
Marine; sketched the Government pro- |
\ gramme and gave a curious insight into
the unpreparedness of the navy during i
the recent Anglo-French crisis. M. t
Lockroy said he regarded the defense of j
the maritime frontier quite as important
i aa the defense of the Yosges frontier and j
! that while France desired peace and
i would earnestly strive to preserve it. a :
: strong navy must be in readiness to repel
aggression- . '
The Minister of Marine then proceeded
â  to reveal a number of startling facts re
lating to the condition of the French ar
! senals at the critical juncture in the re- '
lations between France and Great Britain ;
some months ago. He quoted from the
! much-talked-of letter written by General
Desbordes last year, declaring that "not
I one our naval bases ls able to fulfill the
1 functions for which it was established |
I or capable of making a defense to save
I the honor of French arms."
"To-day. however." the Minister de- *
clared, "our coast defenses are so much
: improved that we can speak of the condl- '
tions of nine months ago as of the dis
tant past. The difficulty at that time was :
an almost absolute lack of men. At our
principal ports only one-third of the bat
teries could be manned on the first day of
the mobilization, and most of the shells
had no fuses.''
VIGOROUSLY DENOUNCE
THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC
LOS ANGELES. March 17.â The secur
ing of options on oil lands in the Knob
Hill district, the fashionable residence
portion of the city, by the Southern Pa
cific Company, has aroused property own
ers to the highest pitch of excitement- A
score of members at a meeting of the
West Lake Improvement Association
prepared resolutions denouncing the
Southern Pacific for acquiring land for ,
oil drilling purposes within the 1600-foot
radius of the proscribed district and de
claring the dragging of oil wagons would
ruin the residence portion. The language
was violent, and while it embodies the
feeling of property owners, it will not be
presented in its present form to the
Council on Monday, when the matter will
have a hearing.
A significant portion of the resolutions
Is. that it demands that the City Council
shall not alter in any manner the pres
ent ordinance. If the law stands the
railway will be compelled to devise other
methods to obtain oil for fuel.
TO CLOSE THE "GAP."
SANTA BARBARA. March 17.â The first
construction outfit, consisting of ten car
loads of graders, scrapers, portable houses
and tools, arrived here to-night and will
go to the front to-morrow. Work on the
"gap" between Elwood and Surf will com
mence next week. The outfit that arrived
to-night was the property of one contract
or, who will have ninety teams os Mon
day. Orders were given to hurry the
work.

' The man is consid- V /
ered the most reckless of men '_________% \
who risk* his life by putting *y3& jf x
his head into the mouth of I-**'
a savage lion. The men who perform this
foolhardy act are few and far between.
There are tens of thousands of men who
daily do a much more rash and dangerous
deed. They are the men who overwork
and neglect their health. No man can do
this with impunity. The inevitable result
is serious illness and premature death.
One of the most common results of care-
lessness in regard to health is consumption.
There is one. and only one. unfailing rem-
edy for this dread disease. It is Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery. It has a record
of thirty years, during which time it has
cured 98 per cent, of all cases of bronchial,
throat and lung affections. It acts directly
on the digestive and nutritive organism. It
creates a healthy appetite for food, facili-
tates the flow of digestive juices and pro-
motes the assimilation of the life-giving ele-
ments of the food. It is the great blood-mak-
er, flesh-builder and nerve-tonic. In cases
of nervous prostration it builds up the nerve
fibres and gives sound, refreshing sleep.
** I took a severe cold with sore throat." writes
Mrs. A. S. Everhart, of Oard Spring. Scott Co.,
Ind. - " Soon I began to cough. My right side
became sore so that when I coughed ft seemed as
though my side would burst. .The physician said
I had pleurisy. I took his medicine for some
time and got no better. All through the spring
and summer I used mustard plasters and fly blis-
ters on my side and over lungs. Finally I began
to ache 90 badly between my shoulders that I
could hardly endure it ana at times almost
smothered. My breath was so short that I could
scarcely talk. Several of my near relatives hat-
died of consumption. I thought I would try
. Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery. I took
two bottles of it, and two .his ' Pleasant Pel-
lets,' and am a new person. I would uot take
any money for the benefit received."

QUARANTINE REGULATIONS.
I-* HE necessity for State and Federal co-operation
in quarantine has been admitted by both Federal
and local authority. The exercise of quarantine
powers by municipalities within the States is of doubt
ful utility.
It is admitted in behalf of the. Board of Health of
'this, city that authority should be by the Legislature
concentrated in the State Board of Health. This will
.cure the present evil of splitting up control and re
sponsibility and scattering them among. the cities and
counties ot the State, making all sanitary supervision
so much everybody's business that in time of need it
is apt to be nobody's business. The yellow fever
â States, on the Gulf of Mexico and our South Aatlan
tic seaboard, have had this whole question long before
'them as a burning issue.
Joseph Y. Porter, M. D., State Health- Officer, of
: .Florida, in a communication to the Committee on
'â â Commerce -of the United States Senate last year, said:
"It can be said with truthful positiveness that some
of the methods introduced by the Marine Hospital
Service, or by the authority of the Supervising Sur
veyor General of that service, were injudicious and,
however honestly intended, had. as much if not
'"greater effect in creating panic and commercial dis
aster in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama
and Texas during the last autumn as did the failure'
to maintain proper regulations by the various State
Boards of Health of those States, a failure which, it is
but justice to those Boards of Health to say, was due
to the' defectiveness of their several State statutes
upon the subject. * * * Any one who will care
fully study, the problem of prevention of contagious
disease introduction and suppression of cases as they
arise, and before an epidemic of the same ensues, can
not 'ail to be impressed with these facts first, that it
is a State duty to provide adequate legislation for the
purpose; second, experienced and conservative men
only should administer the statutes, through and by a
.sell equipped State Board of Health."
Dr. John M- Williamson, in a paper on State quar
antine read at a conference of . the local" Boards of
Health in this city "in '1897, said: "It is eminently
proper to criticize with severity the apathy and dere
liction shown by the State of California in not having
provided at its principal port modern and complete
facilities for the exercise of quarantine, and particu
larly in the matters of disinfection and fumigation."
These declarations should be . sufficient to demon
strate the need of the presence of the State in co
operation with the Federal Government
Before a Federal quarantine officer was placed here,
following the opening of the quarantine station by the
Federal Government on Angel -land, an infected
ship toad to lie in the stream, her well passengers
â¢cooped up with the sick, her mails and cargo held
on board, until the quarantine period was passed.
'If she were a Pacific liner she lost her sailing day, her
owners lost the use of her and shippers and passen
gers were Curtailed in the conveniences of travel and
commerce. â¢ ."* v â '.-..
This had gone on for years because there was no
quarantine station where her passengers could be
landed, the sick : and well separated, mails fumigated
and cargo and ship disinfected and the vessel made
; ready, for prompt docking in time for her outsailing
date. It will be seen, then, that in its operation here
exclusive local jurisdiction was so inefficiently
equipped that it was" a restraint upon trade and a bar
to commerce, while affording less protection than it
should to the public health. '
As there is now a quarantine station provided by
the United States, let the State do its duty, put. itself
in line. for co-operation and increase its own safety,
by concentrating local authority in one place.
It must not be forgotten that if our courts should
hold utterly against the Federal presence in quaran
tine matters, and Federal jurisdiction should entirely
recede, after ail effective- quarantine, without embar
rassing trade, could only be had by using the Federal
station on Angel Island. This fact is sufficient .to in

I ECLIPSE OF THE ANTI-CARTOON BILL.
JUDAS ISCARIOT was an apostate, Danton
was a fiend, Howard E. Wright is a disgraced
legislator who supports Dan Burns",- : y â 
If thirty, days had! elapsed, and a new. 1 'section,
numbered 258, which the- Legislature ' has- declared
part of the Penal Code, were an approved and a con-,
stitutional law, the proprietor of The Call, by permit
ting the publication of this article without, a signature,
would have subjected himself ( to the forfeiture of
three sums of one thousand dollars* each, ndt to- be
imposed as fines for criminal misdemeanors, but. to be ,
' collected by civil 'actions in the name of any person
I who happened to want fifteen hundred dollars, the
\ proceeds of which would be equally divided between
[the plaintiff and the State. Even the owner of the
Examiner, under similar conditions,. could not escape
these penalties through a residence in New York, be
cause his property could be attached without. even -the
formality of obtaining jurisdiction over his person.;
We refer to the section; as drafted and introduced
by Senator. Morehouse and pressed 'by himself and,
by. Grove' L. Johnson, 'aided by legislators of simi
larly unique reputation,' in order to gratify- their.per
sonal malignity. It -had been supposed .that the. pos
sible depth of legislative* asininity had been reached, by
the anti-cartdon'bill.' But this "last ; enactment,, ho
matter how amended, ishndre ridiculous.^ I*o say that
Judas" Isca'not' was '*an apostate" or that Danton was
"a fiend," within the text. of the. new*: section, -"tends
to blacken the memory, of one,. who- is dead,? and! to
call 'Howard E: Wright "a^ disgraced - legislatorVsis
"to .impeach the.' honesty, integrity, virtue reached by
anti-cartoon â¢bill. But this last enactment, no
:ter how amended, is- more ridiculous. T*o say that
as Iscariot was '"an apostate" or that Danton was
fiend," within the text of the new section, "tends
blacken the memory, of one who is dead," and to
Howard E. Wright "a disgraced legislator" is
impeach the honesty, integrity, virtue or repufa-.
tion" "of one who is -alive." ' Each; of these Pate
nts, -whether true oi false, whether*' published for
the public good or to -subserve private ends, -tmless
signed, "by -the true : name of the writer." under the
new enactment -entails a penalty of one thousand dol
lars, to be paid, not by the writer, but by the "owner,
proprietor or publisher." The new section is in the
Penal Code, but the money is to be collected not
through the criminal courts, but in civil actions.
The statute is evidently designed not, -merely to de
prive the press of its privilege, but to benefit the'
needy, for, as to each penalty incurred, the right of
action is vested in the first person who becomes a
plaintiff and brings the suit. His" compensation is
lin -half of the judgment, which would liberally re
ward both him and his attorney. It is proper to ob
serve that as to each "article, statement or editorial,"
the "owner, proprietor or publisher" has to deter
mine for himself whether it comes within the lan
guage of the act, and, therefore, whether it has to be
signed or can represent merely the name and the :
standing of the "newspaper or other printed publica- j
tion." I
This clumsy imitation of French law is a rich illus
tration of the great legal combination that produced
it. If it could stand the newspaper remedy would be
the employment of skilled bullies, bravos and assas
sins. Unfortunately, however, for the bloodthirsty
promoters of this last" scheme to protect dishonest
public servants, article 1. section 0, of the State con
stitution provides that "every citizen may freely speak,
write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being
responsible for the abuse of that right," and speci
fically states that "NO LAW SHALL BE PASSED
TO RESTRAIN OR ABRIDGE THE LIBERTY
OF SPEECH OR OF THE PRESS." Persons
in the category of Grove L. Johnson. Senator More
house and Howard E. Wright have both criminal and
civil remedies, unless it appears that "the matter
charged as libelous is true and was published with
.good motives and for justifiable ends-'.'. i< -, k - l s : f_ ?.- y
...As, .under our American system, the liberty of the.
pi-ess, subject to the double mode of redress for wan
ton libels, to which we have adverted, embraces the
publication of unsigned articles and statements, it is
not within legislative . competency to prescribe the
manner in which the publication is to be made. It is
equally unconstitutional . without consideration to
transfer a right of action from the State to a man who
can outstrip his competitors in a race to a courthouse.
For these and for many other reasons that might be
assigned we are of the opinion that the new legislative
beneficiaries must .depend upon some other means of
filling their depleted pockets, and that the writers of
newspaper articles may still hope to escape the venge
ance of exposed corruptionists.
THE PRESIDENT VINDICATED.
IN politics the Examiner is as unprincipled as any
newspaper in the United States. It prefers false
conjectures to any semblance of fact. Its treach
eries to the party it nominally espouses have been in
numerable. Its attacks upon the .Republican party
are destitute of any trace of honor. It has professed
to be a rampant opponent of the railroad. From the
beginning of the Senatorial contest at Sacramento to
the present moment, as he who runs can read, it has
acted in harmony with, the railroad conspiracy to de
stroy Republican ascendency in this State, and iii the
most underhanded and sneaking manner has done all
in its power to advance the interests of Dan Burns.
On Wednesday last it opened its battery of false
hood against President McKinley by charging that,
with Senator Hanna as his engineer and using the
National Republican Committee as the instrumental
ity, he had commenced ah intrigue for his own re
election. This statement; the Examiner must have
known to be a lie. Even though Mr.. McKinley were
a Republican Machiavelli,his intelligence would 'save
him from a premature scheme to control the National
Republican Convention of 1900, the disclosure of
which would concentrate against him all the aspiring
statesmen in the Republican party and would also ex
cite popular animosity. But there has been nothing
in the life of Mr. McKinley, before or since his elec
tion to the Presidency, to indicate that he would use
his official position to secure re-election or that he
has any personal desire to succeed himself. Peculiar,
combinations of circumstances, especially resplendent
services -to the country, have compelled several of our
Presidents to serve for two consecutive terms, but
apart from partisan inventions {here is' no instance,
so far as we are apprised, of such political degrada
tion as constitutes the only pretension of Dan Burns
to a Federal Senatorship having received Presidential
sanction. Washington reluctantly sacrificed the rest
and. peace he had so hardly earned, and which might
have prolonged his invaluable life, to . the universal
demand of his country. In every subsequent instance
of a second term immediately following the. first the
nomination and election responded to an irresistible
pressure. President Lincoln, after having led the
great struggle for the maintenance of the Union,
ccuid not have avoided re-election, and he became a
martyr to duty in a double sense. President .Grant
was carried into a second term by an. invincible-pres
tige. President Cleveland destroyed his chance for.
re-election as his own successor by a firm adherence
to political opinions, which commanded the respect
while invoking the successful opposition of the "Re
publican party, arid it was only through a temporary
reaction that he succeeded in defeating Benjamin
Harrison and, for a second term, became President of
the United States. ;bs
We repeat that, in American history there! is
no precedent for the foul libel that the Examiner has
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH IS, 1899.
basely published against the gentleman who has been
so signally honored by the nation, and under whose
administration the, hearts of the people in every sec
tion of the republic have ratified the outcome of the
.Civil War. It is not impossibleâ is indeed highly
probable that when the proper time comes a strong
movement for the re-election of Mr. McKinley may
originate within the mass of Republican citizens, but
not at his suggestion, and still less' through the at
tempted manipulation of any part of the machinery
of the Republican party.
During the remainder of the legislative session the
-Examiner had better adhere to its programme of,
subserving the treachery of the railroad by promoting
the election of Dan Burns and depriving the Repub
lican nominee for the Presidency whomsoever he
may be, of the vote of California in- 1900.
THE HAPPY DEMOCRATIC FAMILY.
COLONEL WILLIAM J. BRYAN, in response
to an invitation from the Hon. Perry Belmont
requesting him to attend a Democratic
banquet in New York, replied: "'Remembering that
you openly repudiated the Democratic platform in the
last campaign, I desire to know before answering the
invitation whether you have since the election pub
licly announced your conversion to the principles set
forth in that platform."
To that inquiry, in which there was seemingly much
more sarcasm than courtesy, Mr. Belmont retorted:
'.'â¢The invitation extended to you was on behalf of the
Democratic Club. Individual opinions have not been
considered in issuing the invitations to celebrate the
birthday of Thomas Jefferson."
bin that exchange of repartee the victory goes to
the effete Easterner and not to the exuberant man of
the"" Platte Valley. Nevertheless, Bryan was right.
Whether the declarations of the national platform are.
to be regarded as principles, as Mr. Bryan calls them, I
or individual opinions, as Mr. Belmont prefers to i
term them, the fact remains they are matters of some j
importance. A Democratic banquet designed as a
party festival must necessarily furnish its guests with
something in the way of a feast. of reason and a flow :
of soul, and Mr. Bryan had a right to ask what sort
of doctrine he was expected to swallow on the occa- !
sion, i
In fact, these "individual opinions," as Mr. Belmont j
calls them, have become burning issues even in this j
off year, when politics is expected to be smoldering j
instead of blazing. Recently the Democrats of Michi- j
gan held a State convention in the classic city of j
Kalamazoo and made the free silver plank of the :
Chicago platform the test of eligibility. No man was j
permitted to sit in the convention who did not ac- i
cept it. His individual opinion had to square with the I
platform or he was counted out. .*
When the news of that proceeding reached New
York there was wrath in the metropolis. The Demo
cratic press of the city did not treat the issue as one of
individual opinion which could be overlooked. On
the contrary, they started up as at the sound of a
war cry, and, getting out their hatchets and the scalp
ing knives, proceeded to lay about among the Michi
ganders like so many rivals of Bombastes Furioso.
The New York. Times, for example, warned the
Democrats of the South not to be misled by the action
in Michigan. Its argument was that Democracy in
Michigan, being in a hopeless minority, may "de
clare for polygamy, free rum, free theft, and enroll the
cheating of creditors among the cardinal virtues," for
it has' nothing to lose, but in the South Democracy
has great interests at stake and must be careful.
Warming to._ the subject, the Times said: "The
- Democrats :of 'Michigan -enjoy all the^large ' irrespon
sibility of the idiot, impotent and. at ease in his asy
lum, who sets at defiance the laws of decency and re
viles with obscene gibberings his unheeding keepers.
The. Democrats of the South are in no such free po
sition."
When such language as that is being shouted about
by the New York Democracy on the. slightest provo
cation, it is not to be wondered that Mr. Bryan de
sired to know what sort of stuff he would be expected
to swallow at the Jefferson banquet. He may not be
so good at repartee as the clever Mr. Belmont, but he
at least knows enough to keep out of a slaughter
house.
MY LORD, THE POUNDMAN.
SAUSALITO'S Trustees may be ordinarily a
\ bright and brainy lot, but they surely are sub
ject to lapses into silliness. â¢ They have con
ferred'upon the poundkeeper. the herder of the c--
.'canine, power to enter any private premises and
search from basement to garret, not omitting the
! closet where the family skeleton may be concealed.'
1 The lordly poundman does not need any legal paper.
His entire authority is to- consist of a suspicion that
the premises may harbor a dog.
We have not the honor of acquaintance with the-
Sausalito brand of purp-pursuer, but if he is any
like the variety which has at times b devastated this"
city, there would be nothing, for householders to do
but abide at home with a shotgun in easy reach.
â¢â  Of course a law so wildly unconstitutional will never
stand a test, and unless the dog gentleman is a fool
he will not be party to any effort to have it tested.
He would by invading private property run grave
risk of being kicked out, and the consciousness of de
serving every kick would add to the pang of his
I bruises. No. American citizen with sense enough to
go in out of the rain, and a place to go, will permit
a prowling interloper, even though backed by an ab
surd band of Trustees,' to nose about his buildings or
to enter them without warrant or invitation. "â¢
Those Trustees, as soon as they experience a lucid
interval, should get together and rescind this bit of
freak legislation." '. Â'",.
A burglar recently caught in the act of pillaging a
house in this city had in his pocket at the time a
beautiful letter from his mother counseling him to be
honest, and appealing to him with all the ardor of a
mother's love not' to disgrace the family. name., The
picture of the man, as well as his conduct, shows him
to be a degenerate. He needs a term in the peniten
tiary, and for the sake of this mother it ought to be
foi life." 1 "'"''..'. â¢ .
Possibly the election of Senator Clark of Mon
tana was due to corrupt methods. . However, the
charge coming from the Daly faction of the Demo
cratic, party does not appear effective. This faction
embraces the people who put up $30,000, pretending
that it came from Clark, and who had to forfeit the
sum. It does not seem that they are in a position to
be casting stones. â¢'
Dai-iel O'Shea has pleaded guilty to murder in the
second degree, which is very kind of him. Plainly
enough he is guilty of worse, but the difficulty and
expense of proving it have evidently appealed to the
better 'nature of O'Shea. He cannot be hanged, and
there would be no utility in imprisoning ; him for
longer than the term of his natural life. "".'.'

IMPORTANT MEETING MONDAY
AUDITOR WELLS COMES IN FOR
UNJUST CRITICISM. '
Has Always Taken the - Side of -the

Creditors. . . .
The teachers and the merchants may !
reconcile their differences any day, and j
thus-make possible the payment of such '
[ debts of the School Department as there j
I may be funds on hand to meet. The '
I teachers are said to be tired of the war j
; they have waged in the courts, where '
every ' decision handed down has been
against them. It was shown that they j
were not preferred creditors, and also j
that the one-twelfth act applied to the !
funds of the department preventing the I
payment of the salaries of one month out !
j of the funds of another.
A meeting will be held on Monday, at j
( which time it is expected an agreement !
j may be reached which will prove a happy '
! way out of the difficulties which have be
set them since last December.
Attorney Louis de F. Bartlett, who has :
been identified with the struggle of the j
j teachers to secure the money due them,
I called on Auditor Wells yesterday. He
! wished that official to send a letter to
I the teachers defining his stand in the con- |
; troversyoVer the money. I This Mr. Wells
declined to do, saying he had no apology !
to offer nor defense to make. j
"I was told," said Mr. Wells last night,
"that an impression prevailed among the |
teachers that I was antagonistic to them I
and - favored the merchants. Nothing
could be farther from the truth. I have
not for one moment fought the teachers,
: but have done all in my power to help
I their cause. When I was authorized to
sign the warrants 1 called together my ;
'. assistants on a Sunday and we worked ;
i all day. I also sent for Secretary Simp- i
son of the Board of Education and he (
I worked all night to have the warrants j
ready for the teachers on Monday morn
ing at 7 o'clock. The teachers were paid
that morning. 7 â¢
"I know that some of the teachers say,
'If Bill Broderick was Auditor we would
: get our money.' This would not help
matters, as if the money was paid out j
i illegally there would have to be an ac- *
i counting some day, and even now attor- j
neys are claiming that Mr. Broderick may
yet be held personally responsible for
money paid on demands audited by him." 1
Persons in the City Hall who are famil
! iar with the workings of the Auditor's ;
i offlce affirm that Mr. Wells' first thought :
i throughout this controversy over school |
funds has been for the teachers. .

The state commander read his report
' showing the work of the order during the
past two years. From this it appeared
i that the order, organized in 1878, had in
j 1881 a membership of about 700, and that
' on the first of last January it had a mcm
i bership of 377,786. The order was estab- :

In the afternoon the State commander,
' in accordance with the new rule, ap-
I pointed the following officers for the ses
sion: W. S. Lacey of Pasadena, P. C;
i C. J.Walter of Los Angeles, Lt.; K. M.
Brown of Oakland. R. X.; H. L. Tickner

D Barkley of Redondo, first M. of G.;
F. L. Mitchell of Santa Ana, second M.
of G. ; M. F. Ball of Santa Cruz, sentinel;
R. J. Smith of San Diego, picket.
Then followed the election of the repre
sentatives to the Supreme Tent. H. L.
Tiekner nominated S. W. Hall, present
State, commander, and C. J. Walters
nominated W. E. Chamberlain of Los An
geles, and as there were no other nomina
" tions the nominees were elected. H. L.
Tlckrier and C. J- Walters were elected
! as alternates.
The rest of the afternoon was taken up
in the discussion of matters under the
head of good of the order, and a recess
j was taken until evening, at which time
there was the exemplification of the
ritualistic work of the order by a team
from San Francisco Tent in its full and
beautiful regalia, which cost JSOO. The
work was done in a manner that won the
admiration of the representatives. The
' work was followed by a banquet, at
! which much good feeling prevailed and a
j number of addresses were delivered.
At the assembly of . the Ladies of the
I Maccabees there was little but pre
paratory work during the morning ses
sion, which was called to order by Mrs.
EudOcia Moffatt, the State commander.
In the afternoon the following officers
were elected for the current term: Lady-
Walker of Los Angeles, P. L. C. ; Lady
Moffatt of San Francisco, L. C. ; Lady

wards of Oakland, L. M. at A.; Lady
McCarvlUe of Dunsmuir. L. St.; Lady
Barnstable of Loomis, Placer County,
L. P.; Lady Wastier of San Francisco,:
organist.
Then came the election of representa
tive to the Supreme Hive, and there was
a strong contest as to whether the one
to be chosen should be from the north or
the south of the State, and after a long
I discussion Lady Walker of Los Angeles
; defeated Lady Moffatt of San Francisco.

PROTECTING FOOD FISH.
Another Lot of Striped Bass Seized
by State Officers.
The persistency with which some, of the
up-river fishermen violate the law for the
protection of striped bass causes the State
Fish Commissioners and their deputies
not a little annoyance. These fish were
brought from the East at no small ex
pense to the State and planted. in the riv
ers. They were recognized as the best of
game and food fish, frequently reaching
as much as fifty pounds in weight. In
order that they may become of fair size a
law was passed prohibiting the taking of
these .bass under three pounds in weight.
Nevertheless the net fishermen in the riv
ers persist in killing everything that they
can get into their nets, and hundreds of
pounds of the prohibited fish are taken.
The only way to put a check upon this
unlawful work is to arrest the offenders
on every occasion and confiscate all fish
under three pounds.
It seems to be much easier to arrest the
offenders than to secure their conviction,
the Judges of the Police Courts being ap
parently afraid of the "push" that seeks
to save the lawbreakers from being pun
ished. The deputies, however, have their
own wav when they can find any of the
small fish, for confiscation means the loss
of so much money. One of the last raids
was made yesterday by Deputy J. H. Da
vis, who seized ISO pounds of undersized
striped bass sent to the American Union
: Fish Company by G. Gurcovich of j So
brante. The entire lot was underweight.
Arrests will follow. - - ,
The fishermen's loss will be some one s
gain, for the fish will be given to some
charitable institution for food. *vhich is
sure to be a rare treat, as no finer fish
can be found on the Pacific Coast.
A DIRTY PLACE.
That's What the Special Agents Term
the San Francisco Custom House.
Special Treasury Agents Smith and
Linck have expressed the opinion that
the San Francisco Custom-house is the
dirtiest they have ever seen. Owing to
the thick layer of dirt on the windows
the interior wears a gloomy and Silurian
aspect, and visitors are thereby Impressed
with the idea that the San Francisco Cus
tom-house is what it looks to beâ a rather
slouchy affair. This is. however, a mis
conception, and the fault for it lies with
Janitor Lewis, who Is directly responsible
for the dirty condition of the place.
Chief Clerk Jerome remarked yester
day: "It is largely our. own affair whether
the windows are clean or not." But his
hearers disagreed with him, for the rea
son that Mr. Jerome is not paying out of
his' own pocket the salary of the janitor
and of the four janitorial assistants. On
the contrary, these salaries, as well as
that of Chief Clerk Jerome, are paid out
of the pockets of the dear people, and the
dear people expect clean windows at
least once a month for their money..
It is believed that the special agents
will have something to say in their forth
coming report concerning the employment
by the Government of cleaners who do
not clean. The visit of the agents has
been productive of much good, for they
have succeeded In infusing a semblance of
life into that: decaying and cobwebbed
ruin, the old Custom-bouse.

Oyer Four Million Dollars Would Be
â  Bequired to Improve the Out

quested.
Chairman Perrault and" his associates
on the Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors have been grappling roi
weeks with questions of improvements
which if granted would raise the rate or
taxation far. above the dollar limit, w
which the Supervisors are pledged. me
members of the Merchants' Association
were particularly active during the last
campaign in having the pledge regarding
the dollar limit inserted in the platform
of each party. In view of this the Su
pervisors have determined to refer tho
multitude of requests "for improvements
to the association -for the opinion of its
members as to the disposition to be made
0 h c e f o e i?o U w-m S g report will be presented
to the board on Monday and It is : ex
pected the matter will be at once referred
to the Merchants' Association:
Recognizing the public-spirited character
of the Merchants' Association and Its efforts
to accomplish municipal improvements by
object. lessons at the expense of the mem
bers and business men connected there
with have resulted in improvements being
made, which were effected solely by ; their
persistent and disinterested efforts and
while your honorable board are the sole
judges of what should or should not be
done, it is well to have the opinion and
advice of our business men. The improve
ment clubs which present claims tor im
provements at the public expense from their
extent and cost, unless all are meritorious
may frustrate and prevent many laudab c
objects from being accomplished. It tt '*
therefore reasonable and your ''^mittee
believe it to be proper to submit to saia
association the various projects submitted
by the improvement clubs for their consid
eration and opinion of what act on should
be taken on the respective propositions pre
sented believing that the interests of this
community having characterized the act on
of this association it is well to consult with
representatives, of our business interests in
th Your ma com r mitt c therefore recommends
that the clerk be directed to forward to
safd association a list of the improvements
required in the petitions received from the
improvement clubs of this city and county.
Â« oT ascertain, under the pledge exacted as
to the limit of taxation, what provision
should be made if the *"*â  â Â»

the funds therefor should be raised by the
issuance of bonds or in the tax levy with

Representatives of the .Federation of
Mission Improvement Clubs were present
at the meeting yesterday to ask that pro-.
! vision made in the forthcoming tax
levy for schools in the Mission district.
Their petition was referred, with others,
to the Merchants' Association. The dele
gates took affront at a suggestion that
the clubs they represent were not as pow
erful 'as the Merchants' Association, and
that they should organize the working
men of the- city and thus have a strong
voice in. matters pertaining to the gov

ETIQUETTEâ City. The word eti

gardener, who laid out the grounds at
Versailles for Louis XIV, being much an

made grounds, at length had labels placed
to indicate where they might pass. At
first no heed was paid to the labels, but a
hint from high quarters that in future
the walks of the courtiers must be within
the etiquettes was promptly attended to,
and to keep within the etiquettes beeama
the correct thing. The meaning of the
phrase was afterward widened, and 1*

The commands startled the unfor
tunate and thoughtless wheelmen
who happened along Market street
In the immediate vicinity 'of the Pal
ace Hotel yesterday afternoon.
There is an ordinance which pro
hibits wheelmen from riding on
wheels not provided with the warn
ing boll, but the guardians of the
peace did not enforce the law until
the streets assumed a respectable
appearance in their neat dress of
bitumen. Now that a wheel will
glide along as noiselessly over the
smooth surface of the principal
thoroughfare as a cat steals on a
mouse, several accidents have re
cently happened, and to prevent any,
further upsets to man or beast the
ordinance is being enforced.
The first wheelman that passed
the scouts in blue did not. have as
much as a bunch of keys to rattle,
He. was quickly overhauled and
questioned.
The wheelman pleaded ignorance
of the ordinance and was allowed to
ride on after receiving a valuable
lesson.
The most Intel sting and laugh
able occurrence uf the day's wheel
chasing was in connection with the
escape of an Â»-date rider who
had his wits about him. He was
also scorching, but in a moderate
way. After having passed the "pro
vost guard" by running his bike
within close proximity to the side
walk. the command to halt was
given by an officer, but the wheel
man refused to obey the ultimatum.
Finally be was stopped by a son of
the , Emerald Isle, who, with club
drawn, shouted:
"Hou up or I'll fire:"
The rider quickly dismounted and

The big-hearted officer, with a

"Ride on. me boy. I don't see

Presently in the distance was seen
a dashing blonde who was coming
along on her bicycle at a two-forty
gait. As she drew nearer It %ras
seen that she was beautiful of face
and figure, handsomely attired, and
was. as i.- spoken in the vernacular,
a "peach." The crowd became
hreathless as it was further ob
served that her bicycle was not pro
vided with a bell. It grew more
breathless as the guardian of the
peace straightened himself out ap
parently with the intention of plac

breathed again when It saw that
she was allowed to ride along with

and paid:
"Why did you not arrest that lady

"Well," replied the custodian of

ANOTHER BIG CANNERY FLEET
ABOUT SIXTY VESSELS WILL
GO NORTH THIS YEAR.

The Helen N. Kimball Safe at Pan
ama St. Patrick's Day on the
Frontâ Erskine M. Phelps
for Honolulu.
A big fleet of vessels Is fitting out for
the salmon canneries this year. There is
hardly a wharf on the front from Market
street to the Mail dock but has one
or more of these vessels fitting out for the
voyage to the north. All these ships car
ry from 300 to 500 tons of coal for the use
of the canneries and the tenders, so those !
vessels that go to the coal mines for car- !
goes are now distributing the black dia
monds among the rest of the fleet.
The coal will serve for ballast, the re
mainder of each vessel's cargo being made
up of food supplies, tin plate and boxes.
As from fifty to sixty' sailing vessels and
steamers are going north this year and '
all expect to get away within the next '
twenty days, it can easily be seen that the |
salmon fleet is creating some business on
the front. The shipping of crews and the
engaging of fishermen will begin about
April 1, and as over 50-50 men will go north
with the fleet the excitement will be at
its height about that time.
The Alaska Packers' Association is
sending north a very large fleet this year
It will consist of the ships WJ H.-Macy.
St. Nicholas. Oriental, Sin tram, Bohemia
Indiana, Santa Clara, L. J. Morse Invin

Some of the smaller steamers will be
taken north on the decks of the sailing
vessels but the majority of them will go
to Alaska under their own steam. Hume's
vessels and those of the Pacific Steam
W haling Company will sail about the
same time as the association's fleet.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
C nina arrived from the Orient yesterday
with 8G cabin, Go second cabin and 182
Chinese in the steerage. Soon after leav
ing "J_okohama two light cases of smallpox
were discovered among the Chinese crew. !
The men were at once isolated and when
Honolulu was reached they were landed
there. When the steamer reached this
port the quarantine officers went aboard
and at once ordered the China into quar
antine. Those of the cabin passengers
who, did not show any mark of vaccina
tion were required to be inoculated and
nine or ten hail to undergo the operation
much to their disgust.
There was one exception, however. Chun
Yuen Chi, who comes here from China to
take a position in the Chinese consulate
refused point blank to be vaccinated In
structions were in the hands of the Cus
tom House officers to pass his baggage at
once and give him every assistance, while
Surveyor Spear was on hand to show him
the courtesies of the port, but when the
diplomat refused to be vaccinated the in
structions from the powers that be could
not save him. and he had to go into quar
antine with the ship. The" vessel will be
released to-day, but the diplomat and the
second cabin passengers and the Chinese
will have to remain on Angel Island for a
fortnight.
Thirteen Roman Catholic missionaries
from Manila came upon the China. They
are bound for Centra! America and will
leave on the next Panama steamer.
â¢ St. Patrick's day was very quietly cel
ebrated on the water front yesterday.
Men and boys wearing shamrocks In the
lapels of their coats were plentiful, but
all of them went about their usual busi
ness and there was very little holiday
making. Dave Car right, a well-known
teamster, was one of the happiest men
on the front yesterday. On the 17th of
March last some one painted his office a
vivid green during the night, and next
day Cartwright was the butt of the front.
He has been offering a reward of $50 for
the name of the man who did the job,
and though the finger of suspicion point
**l to 11. Elliott, a rival teamster, the
proof was not forthcoming. Yesterday
morning when Elliott reached his office
it was painted a vivid green, and Cart
wright was happy because the laugh was
on his hated rival.
The fine steel American ship Erskine M.
Phelps was the center of attraction when
she was being docked at Bealc-street
wharf yesterday. Captain Graham had
secured an Irish flag and it floated proud
ly from the foremast of the first vessel
built In America of American steel. From
the peak "Old Glory" -was thrown to tho
breeze, while at the main was displayed
the Sewalls' house flag. After discharg
ing her cargo of coal the Phelps will go to
Honolulu to load sugar for New York.-
She has the best passenger accommoda- I
tion of any sailing vessel that has come i
to San Francisco, and quite a number of *
people are availing themselves of the op
portunity to make a trip to the islands
in , her. The Phelps will get away in
about ten days. > ;â¢;
The tug Rescue had a narrow escape
on the Columbia River bar a few days
ago. She was on her way out to tow in
the ship Howard C. Troop and when on
the worst part of the bar the steering
gear broke. The tug had- a terrible time
of it, and Captain Thompson's son was
thrown on to a bit by a sea and had his
chest badly hurt. Finally the steering
gear was temporarily repaired, and in
stead of turning back Captain Thompson
went on out and towed the Troop into
port.
The overdue schooner Helen M. Kim
ball, over which much anxiety was felt,
arrived at Panama yesterday. She was 105
days out from Eureka, and her crew must
have had a trying time of it.
The cargo of the schooner Laura Mad
sen was sold at auction to J. 'H. Brooks
for $2750 yesterday. When the rush to
the Klondike was on a party of men came
out from the East and chartered the Mad
sen for a trip to St. Michael. They had
considerable money, but they bought a
great deal more than their ready cash
would pay for. as they were expecting
more funds from the East. A young man
was to join the party and put $5000 into
the venture, but when the war broke out
he secured a commission in the army in
stead, and left his friends in the lurch.
The party, after a number of attempts
to fix matters up disbanded, leaving the
schooner's cargo to pay their debts. The
sale yesterday barely realized enough to
settle accounts.
MINISTRY OF ST. LUKE'S.
Rev. D. C. Garrett of Trinity Church,
Portl&nd, Refuses the Call.
Although the Rev. D. C. Garrett of the
Trinity Episcopal Church of Portland,
Or., has been repeatedly requested by his
superiors and the members of the congre
gation of St. Luke's Church of this city
to accept the pastorate of the latter
church, he considers it his duty to refuse
the call. He maintains that he feels it
his duty to remain with the church with
which he has been so long associated,
while his congregation, loth to part with
him, has urgently pleaded with him to
remain and further the good work which
he has so ably conducted. . -
His life struggle, he urges, has been
with the people of the north and should
terminate surrounded by them. However,
if his church demands that he accept the
pastorate of St. Luke's Church his only
course is to obey. Whether the congrega
tion of Trinity Church will be allowed to
retain their minister or be compelled to
lose him and accept another is a matter
that will be probably solved in the near
future by the Episcopal Bishops.
SELF-EXILED FRIARS.
Thirteen Arrive From Manila to Es
' â¢ cape the Filipinos.
Thirteen Spanish friars arrived in this
city yesterday on the China from Macao
and Manila and took apartments at the
Occidental. They are members of the
Missionary Order of RÂ«collet and have
left the Philippines on account of the
Filipinos' desire to persecute them. They
are going to Panama in a few days to
decide as to their final destination.
Fifteen other priests arrived here some
menths ago and went to Peru, Venezuela
and Bolivia, and they will likely be joined
by the newcomers. Though the United
States Government would protect the
friars in Manila, they do not consider
themselves safe from the attacks of the
vengeful Filipinos and they have left for
ever the land where they have labored
unremittingly for years. ::. .
The names of the self-exiled priests are

Harry Dimond Seriously Hurt.
Harry Dimond. a son of Thomas Dimond
of the Comstock mines In Nevada, Is ly
ing at the German Hospital in a critical
condition. The young man, who Is only
17 years of age, was out hunting last
Sunday in the marshes near Washoe
Lake clubhouse. In reaching for his gun
he seised it by the barrel and drew it to- \
ward him. when the hammer caught :
against some obstacle which discharged j
it- _. _.
.The contents entered the young: man |
abdomen and ranged outward, fracturing j
his hip. He was treated by local physi
cians, but from the seriousness of the in- i
lury it was thought advisable to have him i
brought to this city and placed in one of
the hospitals. The latest accounts from
his bedside last night were not encourag
ing. . mm -
In the Divorce Court.
Matilda Strickland was granted a di
vorce from Hiram Strickland yesterday
on the _:r<Xind of failure to provide. Suits
for divorce have* been filed by Mary K.
Collins against Henry T. Collins for de
sertion and M. H. Shearer against F. E.
Shearer for failure to provide.
Against Park Extension.
The county committee of the Non-Par- i
tisan party memorialized the Supervisors j
yesterday against adopting any measures -
looking toward the proposed extension of j
Golden Gate Park panhandle. The com- j

A GLEAM OF
SUNSHINE OUT
AT INGLESIDE
Hand - Book Betting
on Four Races.
THEN THE POLICE ARRIVED
BUT TWO CHOICES REACHED
THE WIRE FIRST.
Andrisa Scored Her Third Victory.
Johnny Reiff Piloted Two Win
nersâTony Licalzi a Sur
prise.
The two or three hundred dejected-look- |
ing devotees of racing, who nervously
strolled in and out of the betting ring at i
Ingleside. like ants in a sand hill, found j
the game dreary and uninviting. To be
sure there was relief from police surveil
lance up to tbe fifth race, after which the |
hots made were told in whispers. But
this handbook betting is not popular with
the speculator possessing limited capital,
and the prices laid were very cinchy. The [
track was heavy and but two favorites j
had their numbers displayed on the top
(line of the indicator.
Report had Corrigan's "Watercress-La
Paloma gelding Antioch working very fast
in private, and he closed an even money
choice for the introductory sprint, lt
must have been too good a thing to un
cork at the price, for the three-year-old
ran unplaced. Campus, at odds of 6to 1, j
won in a hard drive from Festoso.
In the two-year-old scramble "Walter
Jennings' sturdy looking filly Andrisa :
made It three straight. Backed to. 3 to 5
favoritism, she came from fourth place
in the stretch, leading Bassida out a neck,
with a few pounds to spare. Johnny
Reiff landed Ned Dennis in the show.
The winner was faultlessly piloted by j
Spencer.
The light-weighted Jennie Reed cap- |
tured the mile and a furlong selling run. j
She was well supported at 4 and 5. to 1, 1
and catching Truxillo In the run home
downed that mudlark a couple of lengths. ,
Martin rode a zigzag race astride the fa- I
vorite, Sardonic, finishing a close third.
The hurdle affair, over one mile and a |
furlong, afforded Our Climate another op- I
portunity to show his prowess. Starting
favorite he showed first soon after the
start, defeating Granger and Torxoni at
the wire with comparative ease. Frank
Doane sat astride Honig's jumper.
Had the books been on 30 to 1 would no
doubt have been laid against Tony Llcal
zi to win the five and a half furlong han
dicap, for the little horse, was the least
thought of among the four starters. Pick
ing up his 88 pounds he ran over Gualala
in the stretch, winning hands down. Good
Hope disposed of Midlight for the show.

CHOYNSKI AND McCOY.
The Crack Heavy-Weights Now in
Proper Condition to Enter
the King. .
The admirers of high-class fisticuffs
will have an opportunity on Friday even
in-: next of witnessing one of the most
scientific contests between great ring gen
| erals that has ever been afforded in this
I city.
Joe Choynski, the favorite athlete of
the Golden West, will meet the remark
i ably clever "Kid" McCoy in Mechanics'
! Pavilion in a contest booked for twenty
i rounds. It goes without saying that when
i two men of their fame step between the
I ropes of an eighteen or twenty-four foot
, ring something away above the ordinary
. boxing entertainment may be expected.
Among the fighters of the present day
' "Kid" McCoy has without question the
i enviable record. He is now the star of
the pugilistic horizon, and consequently
must be a great attraction wherever he
is scheduled to spar or light.
On Friday evening McCoy will have
, to accomplish something more brilliant
; than lightning taps and flashlight moves
Chovnski is too old a ringster to allow a
! clever boxer to tap him on the claret pipe
< and get away without a return. McCo>
Will doubtless land on the face of unas
suming Joseph many times during the
I â¢â¢mill." but he must needs be mighty care
i ful of a right or left hook, which has
sent many a good man to a cold spot on;
, the hard floor. Certainly McCoy cannot
afford to indulge in gayety while the con
test is on as one -well-directed punch
1 from either of Choynski's man-stoppers
I may bring the battle to a very abrupt
r Â°So C m" i0 a n uthorlties on ' boxing contend
that Choynski has grown .old in the
same to make a successful stand nga lnst
his young and clever opponent. Doubt
less they failed to take Into consideration
that Choynski is several years the junior
Of Bob Fitzsimmons and as a fighter nib
record is better than that of the champion
who won his spurs by defeating two past
masters of th* game, namely Jack Demp
sey and Jim Corbett. Five years ago he
met Fitzsimmons in Boston, and accord
ing to the best authorities Fits was in a
very tight box at one stage of the game
after Chovnski landed a hard left on his
law. The" contest was stopped .by police.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 18, 1899.
NOW FOR STEELHEADS.
Large Run of Fishes Up Paper Mill
Creek Causing Excitement in
Angling Circles.
The recent rain has been welcomed by
anglers as well as by the farmers of the
State. The outlook for April fishing is
now decidedly promising provided that a
long spell of dry weather will not follow
the bounteous downpour of a week that
is drawing to a close.
There are among the fishermen who
have made a study of the so-called mid
winter angling quite a number who con
tend that owing to the late arrival of the
storm comparatively few fishes will as
cend the coast streams in March and
April, and that late storms are not conÂ»
ducive to good sport in the early months
of the trout fishing season.
This may be so in past Winters, when
rainstorms were of frequent occurrence,
but evidence is now at hand to prove that
the steelheadÃ have remained in the
ocean's depths during the months of sun
shine, there awaiting the arrival of a How
of fresh water from the hills and moun
tains. â  \
Now that the creeks are full to over
flowing the game silver-sides of the Pa
eilic have made "a Hying trip" to their
longed for, loving beds, whicn are gen- I
erally near the headwaters of coast
streams visited by the game fishes during !
. the winter months.
Yesterday word was received from Point
Reyes that Champion John Gallagher
1 made an excellent catch on Thursday ,
' afternoon and that several large fish were !
seen "rolling" in the deep pools near the ;
i Point. This news will be welcomed by i
local anglers, many of whom will journey
â  to the old fishing grounds while sport can
! be enjoyed. Good reports haVe also been
i received from Pescadero and Shellville.
Unless a second heavy freshet arrives be
i fore April 1. which will certainly carry ,
numbers of nice fish with it to the ocean,
the prospects for first-class sport in April
and May are certainly of the best.
The following letter explains itself:
Sporting Editor Callâ 'Sir: Captain
Charles Kimball of Oakland, Charles Orr and
Dave Dondero of Fort Bragg fished the Ten
: mile River one day last week. Orr and Don
dero met with great success, landing between
them 110 steelheads, ranging from half a pound
10 three pounds. Orr hooked and lost a very
large fish on account of his reel becoming loose
and failing from the rod just as the fish started
down stream. The captain, however (whose
reputation as a fisherman has always been
high), failed to get a fish. â /;â¢â ;
Every man. woman and small boy in Men
docino County are wondering where the cap-,
tain got his reputation. â -â â  _",___
The captain says that he is not a bait fish
erman, that he never could use salmon roe
(a la Rutler). but that he is witling and ready
when the season opens to try conclusions with
any fisherman in the State of California with
a fly.
! The' writer has seen the captain's fishing
tackle and the rod he uses for salmon fishing
.- of such prodigious proportions that had he
.succeeded in hooking a steelhead anywhere
: from five to forty pounds he could have landed
! him ln Dolliver style.
i The captain is open for a challenge. Tours

FLOYD M'FARLAND
WILL NOT RACE ELKES
DOES NOT LIKE MIDDLE-DIS
TANCE GAME.
A Challenge From the East That Will
Pass Unnoticed Ãay City Road
Race Next Sunday.
The friends of Floyd McFarland do not
think it very sportsmanlike for Harry
Bikes to wait until he got back to Bos
ton and then wire a challenge to "Mac"
to ride him any style, middle distance, for
a big purse, in view of the fact that Mc-
Farland has repeatedly stated openly that
he did not intend to enter the middle
distance game, but would confine himself
entirely to sprint racing.
"The only reason in i_,e world why Mc-
Farland raced Elkes a middle-distancÂ«
match at the indoor tournament,"; said
Jack McGlynn at the Olympic Club yes
terday, "was on account of an article
that appeared in The Call. You remem
ber one night Billy Brady and 'Pop' Bikes
and several others were conversing in the
center of the arena about the respective
abilities of McFarland and Harry Bikes.
I was there and so was a Call man, the
only newspaper man present. 'Pop' Elkes
was very enthusiastic about his boy S
ability and got quite demonstrative. I
think the lad had just ridden. an exhibi
tion mile in 1:50 or something, which is
pretty good going for an indoor . track.
Brady was trying to work old man Kikes
up to a match race. 'Now. come right
down to cases, Mr. Elkes.' he said. Will
your boy race McFarland?' Elkes said
yes if it was for twenty to thirty miles.
If not, he would give in a bit and ride a
fifteen-mile matcn. 'We will ride Mc-
Farland,' said he. 'a fifteen-mile paced
match, and allow him a handicap of two
laps!' " was tickled to death at the pros
"Bradv was tickled to death at the pros
pect of a match. The cuailenge appeared
in The Call the next morning. \\ hen
McFarland craw it he was much surprised,
as he had no intention of doing any mid
dle-distance racing, but he would not be
bluffed. He declined the handicap, went
into the race and won it hands down,
breaking all records. Mac has The Call
to thank for getting into the/ace. but in
sists now that he is out of middle-dis
tance racing for good, and for this reason
I think Elkes' challenge is a good deal

The Reliance Wheelmen seems to be the
only club having anything on the tapis
for* to-morrowâ a run to Laundry Farm.
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold tae
first road race of the season on Sunday,
th*' 26thâ a five-mile event from San Le
andro to Haywards. .
The Bay City Club has two social events
carded for the early part of next monthâ
a dance at the Palace Hotel maple room
on April 5. and a vaudeville show at -Na
tive Sons' Hall on April 13.
The Olympic Wheelmen are talking of

AMONG THE GOLFERS.
Driving, Approaching and Putting
Competitions . on the Links
To-Day.
This afternoon (Saturday, March 18)
there will be men's competitions in driv
ing and approaching on the links of the
San Francisco Golf Club. On the links
of the Oakland Golf Club there will be
putting and approaching contests for la
dies and gentlemen for a silver medal. -
Two competitions on the Adams Point
links are still unfinished. In the men's
foursomes, eighteen holes, match play,
with handicap, begun on March 4, R. M.
Fitzgerald and Arthur Goodall have to
play the final foursome against R. Cooke
and W. A. Magee; and in the match play,
handicap, eighteen holes, begun last Sat
urday, March 11, only the preliminary
and second rounds have been concluded.
In the third round R. Cooke (scratch) has
defeated W. A. Magee (1); A. Goodall (5)
has beaten T. Rickard (7); and W. P.
Johnson (3) has proved victorious over J.
C. McKee (scratch). D. F. Belden
(scratch) has still to play G. D. Green
wood (scratch). In the fourth or semi
final round the winner of the Belden-
Greenwood match will be paired against
K. Cooke, and A. Goodall will play W. P.
Johnson. .
The stormy weather prevented' play on
the Presidio links until Friday, on which
afternoon several players went round the
course for practice. On Tuesday, March
21 there will be (that is, if the programme
ls adhered to) ladies' foursomes, eighteen
holes, with handicap, on the links of the
San Francisco Golf Club; and on Satur
day, March 25, there will be a ladies' com
petition, match play, with handicap, on
the Oakland links. ;
The strained relations between the di
rectors of the San Rafael Golf Club and
certain insubordinate and rapacious cad
dies have been the subject of considerable
newspaper comment and now it appears
the Oakland golfers also have troubles
of their own.
The following rules with regard- to the
employment and payment of caddies have
been adopted by the Oakland club and
the members are requested to adhere to
them: - . ' ...-...-
Rule 1. All caddies are to be paid at the
rate of 15 cents for each game played.
Rule 2. Caddies are not to be engaged
before the moment, at which their ser
vices are required by the player.
j Rule 3. Caddies are |to be taken from
the stand in the numerical order of their
badges, which hereafter will be given out
by the steward each morning in the order
that the boys apply for them.
A separate spot will be assigned to cad
dies employed lii cleaning fcltlbS after hav
ing been rotinrt the course with members.
Members are requested to take the num
ber of any caddy who does not behave
himself properly in order that the matter
may be investigated and the Impropriety
of the caddy demeanor effectually
checked.
IN BARGE AND SKIFF.
Several Regattas Are Being Planned
by Leading Rowing Men.
The circular to the various rowing clubs
around the bay and at Victoria, â¢B. C,
Tacoma, ' Seattle, Portland, Astoria,
Stockton and San Diego, requesting that
three delegates be dent from each club to
a convention of oarsmen, is about ready
to be sent out. The suggestion is made
that the rowing clubs either form a new
organization, to be called the Paciflc Row
ing Association, or join the National As
sociation of American Oarsmen. It is
contended that the Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation, a branch of the Amateur Athletic
Union, has no right to assume powers not
exercised by the union, and that it might
just as well assume control of yachting
as of rowing. If each club has three rep
resentatives in the - proposed association
it will be difficult for a- small clique to
gain control, and it is unlikely that a club
j will be without a representative at any
meeting of the board.
The Alameda Boat Club held an enthu
siastic meeting recently at which the
; plans for the enlargement of the boat
house were â¢ discussed. S. J. Pembroke,
! the representative of the club on the
I board of managers of the P. A. A., was
' instructed to vote against the proposed
j amendment to the constitution that, row
i ing be included in the sports over which
the P. A. A. assumes jurisdiction. The fol
' lowing new members have been recently
; added: A. F. Estabrook, B. E. Remmel,
J. H. Timmens, Fred Klarman, Henry P.
Martine and George N. Atkins.
At the South End Rowing Club's regular
meeting, held last Tuesday, the amend
ment raising the entrance fee to $10 after
April 1. and limiting the number of mem
bers to 100. was passed. .
J. R. Bookman, president of the board
of managers of the P. A. A., and Dr. H.
A. Pless of the Ariel Rowing Club, visited
the Alameda club's boathouse last Sun
day, with the view of seeing what oppor- j
tunities there are ot giving a regatta on
the Oakland Creek. If funds are obtain- :
able it is likely that a short programme j
of four races (two for barges and two for
outrigged skiffs, may be given. Bookman :
will go up to Vallejo and look over the
chances of .getting up a regatta there. It i
is also probable that a regatta will be i
given at Guerneville under the patronage j
of some Santa Rosa people, who are will
ing to leave the control of the event in
the hands of the board of managers of the
P. A. A.
The new senior barge crew of the Ariels
is made up of "William Howe, Robert
Ellis, James O'Connell and Frank Loth. In'
the junior barge crew E. McDonough, A.
Haughton and E. Lynch are left, and a ;
fourth man will be found among the new
members. The Wilson crew has chal
lenged the Pembroke crew, which con
sists of S. J. Pembroke and his four sons.
The race between the family crews would
be an interesting event for the Ariel Club i
regatta.
On Sunday, March 19, shortly before i
noon, the race between J. S. Earls' and i
T. J. Sullivan's barge crews will take
place from the Dolphin boathouse. About ,
the middle of April the first of a series
of races in outrigged skiffs for a medal |
will be held. The medal must be won |
I three times before it becomes the property
of the winner. The competitors will be ;
W. Bush, George Baker. J. Farrell, Dr. :
Axton and C. T. Roach. The medal is the
one which was retained by L. Hausler for
so long a time that it was regarded as
lost. Recently A. P. Rothkopf recovered
i it among a quantity of old gold intended !
for the smelting pot and restored it to !
I tho club.
INDOOR SPORT.
Olympics, Reliance and the Young
Men's Christian Now Rounding
Up the Winter's Season.
The Reliance and Olympic Athletic
clubs and the Young Men's Christian As
sociation are making the best of the few
last /Week's of indoor sport. â  On â " Tuesday
evening the Reliance Club will entertain
its friends with an interclub baseball
match between the Olympic. and Reliance
nines. Both teams have met before, with
the honors resting on the banners of the
Oaklanders. This will be the third game
and the Olympics are determined to come
out of the battle with at least a single
success. . ,
The last of the interclub handball
matches was played during the week, and
the Olympic teamâ James and Harrison
did things to the Encinals, represented
by Goggin and Masters. The former de
feated the latter by a score of 51â21. __
There will be a warm time In the gym
nasium of the Oakland branch of tne
Young Men's Christian Association on
Tuesday evening, when the Rushers, rep
resenting this side of the bay, line up
against the Athens, who will wear the
colors of the Oakland branch. It will be
the first match of basket" ball between
these two teams this season, and the
rivalry is great. __

the baseball team in a match game with
the Fireman's Fund nine.
Stanford athletics have been steadily
progressing since the beginning of spring
and at this date both the baseball nine
and the track team are in pretty good
shape. The weeks now remaining before
the intercollegiate games in May will . be
used to the best advantage by candidates
for the varsity representative teams. :
The Cardinal baseball nine has played

DAWSON'S SPRING
CLEAN=UP WILL
BE ENORMOUS
Output of Gold Certain to Be Far
in Excess of That of a
Year AÂ£o.
BY SAM W. WALL.
DAWSON, Feb. 14.â The sun stands
daily for four hours above the south
eastern horizon now and "the spring
clean-up is entering into every man's
conversation. I have made three trips
of inspection to different divisions of
this mining district, covering all the
main creeks, and find in all of them a
great deal more work under way than
was attempted last year. The output
therefore will doubtless be nearly as
great in excess of that of last year as
was that of last year over that of the
year before. For six miles on Dominion
Creek, in the Indian River division,
covering the region between the upper
and lower discoveries, and a short dis
tance above and below, almost every
claim is being worked and big dumps
succeed each other continuously. For
fifteen miles below dumps appear at
frequent Intervals. On Sulphur Creek,
another division of the Indian River,
conditions are similar, the improvement
over" last year being in like propoition.
On Hunker Creek the Increased devel
opment is almost as marked and a great
proportion of the gross output will be
credited to it in the general footings
next summer. An immense amount of
prospecting work is being done all over
this vast region and good strikes are re
ported from many widely separated
points. Work is being done on creeks
that last year only figured as so many
crooked lines upon the map and were
heard of only as places to which stam
pedes, for no good reason that anybody
could then discover, had taken place.
This is particularly the case with Eu
reka Creek and Quartz Creek, in the
Indian River division, and on Gold Run
in the Klondike division.
A new strike is reported on Flat
Creek-, one of the main- branches of the
Klondike, one hundred miles from Daw
son. 7 V 7;
The feature of the mining situation
this year is the bench or hillside claim,
which widens the possibilities of the
product by half and turns the whole
year into an "open season." A few
years ago what little mining was done
In this country was done in the sum
mer. Then the winter method of
"burning" or thawing the ground came
Into vogue, by which bedrock could be
reached while the frost binds the water
that at other times inundates the works.
In the summer, for this reason, the gold
that is taken out must come from near
the surface. In the old period of bar
diggings and surface skimming the
summer was the "open season." When
the riches of the deeper bedrock were
discovered through the new method of
reaching them no man was satisfied
with the products of the sandbar and
staked for himself a creek claim and
employed most of the summer, in get
ting out wood and making other pre
parations for the winter's digging. The
winter then became the "open season."
With the wider and constant prospect
ing that followed' the big rush. or gold
seekers it was found that the creek bot
toms did not contain all the wealth -.of
the country. This discovery was made
on the famous Skookum Hill or Skook
um Gulch, which faces Bonanza, a lit
tle below the mouth of Eldorado Creek.
The benches or hillsides of all the
creeks where gold had been found in
quantity have since been searched and
many of them have developed as large
returns and .some of them larger than
do the adjoining creek claims. The
benches on Eldorado and Bonanza have
developed great pay. Several of those
on Dominion form the choicest prop
erty of that creek. Victoria, French
and Gold hills, facing Eldorado, are
now as famous producers as the two
Skookums and are punctured with
prospect holes and shafts all over their
surface and to their very summits. Ex
perts easily trace the "old river chan
nels" all over this country now, wher
ever these finds are made. The record
ed bench and hillside claims greatly
outnumber the creek claims and yet,
as I have said, they were not known
last year except on Skookum Hill.
Many a man went out of this country
last summer carrying with him and
spreading the discouraging and discon
solate cry that "everything is staked"
who tramped over ground on his way to
the boat that has since â¢ made some
more persistent prospector rich. On the
first day of March last I stood on
ground on. Dominion Creek that at that
time no one thought of staking. Last
summer, a few months later, one man
with a rocker washed out $240 a day
from it. I have one acquaintance who
came into the country only last June
and staked a bench away down near
the mouth of Bonanza, where the creek
bottom spreads a half mile wide and
nobody had previously thought it worth
while to hunt and trace its banks. As
he' and his companions knew no better
they went to prospecting and in their
first hole and just under the moss they
found gravel containing "all kinds of
money." They immediately began to
quarrel among themselves and the
claim was sold readily for $15,000.
That the near future holds many
radical changes in the methods of min
ing this frozen earth there is now no
question. Improved methods will
shorten the life of the placer mine and
two years will doubtless see Bonanza
and Eldorado creeks eliminated from
the situation, except, perhaps, for a big
GETS MONEY ON
A BOGUS DRAFT
San Franciscan Wanted
at Sacramento.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March IT.â inci
dent of the Irish Fair recently held in
San Francisco has developed in police
circles here. A complaint was sworn
to before the City Attorney to-day;
charging Louis W. Buckley with hav
ing obtained money by false pretenses.
The complaint was sworn to by George
B. Henry, a local collection agent.
A few weeks ago Buckley . came ,to
Sacramento and presented Henry with
a bill for $25 against Supreme Court
Clerk Root, the charge being for the
publication of Root's picture in half
tone in a circular issued at the Irish
Fair. The bill was made .out On a let
terhead of the fair, on which appeared
the names of a number of ; well-known
citizens of San Francisco as promo
bedrock flume propositionâ is al- ;
ready before Parliament. Steam thaw
ing is so vastly superior to the present
method of "burning" that it will soon
be generally employedâ some
thing better is developed by the busy
brains now working upon the problems
here presented. Steam thawing ma
chines to the number of a score have
been employed this winter on Eldorado,
Bonanza, Hunker and Dominion creeks
and Victoria and Gold hills. The ma
chines are very simple, Introducing
steam into the shaft by pipes. A fire
will thaw during a night from twelve j
to eighteen inches of gravel. The shaft
or drift is left full of smoke and unless j
there be a connecting shaft giving a j
draft, which is every often not the
case, the men are unable to descend for j
hours, and many have become blinded ;
from the effects - of working in the !
smoke. With three hours application j
of steam similar gravel Is thawed to a j
depth of from five to ten feet, accord- j
ing to the volume of steam applied.
Dawson is crowded with disappoint- J
ed men who are simply waiting for the ,
opening of the river and the coming
of the boats to leave the country. The !
number of these saloon -'settlers," as
they are called, runs Into the thou
sands. Very many of them are without*
the necessary "outfit. and are objects
of charity. General McCook, the Amer
ican Consul, is besieged dally for as
sistance and the committee appointed
earlyin the year to obtain subscriptions
for relief of the indigent is still actively
engaged. Provision is already being
made for the sending of a large num
ber of this helpless class down the river
and out of the country as soon as the
river is open. They will be provided
with flat or open boats and enough food
to last them while they row or float to
the mouth of the river, from where
some arrangement will be made for
their getting to the Sound or San Fran
cisco by the ocean vessels.
The spectacle of three hundred people ,
partaking of the free Christmas dinner j
given by the Salvation Army has been
followed by a regularly filled Shelter
every night of the winter. The Army
supplies wood sawyers and workmen
at almost any trade at wages averaging
$2 per day. Many of these idle people >
that crowd the town have had no work !
and have made no money in any way j
since they came Into the country.
A party of eight men have just ar- ;
rived on the ice from the outside.
They tell the town that ten thousand j
people are coming in here in the spring.
Very well. Every man has a right to *
do as he wills so long as he can pay
his way. I repeat that opportunity is j
wide open here as it is at any legiti- |
mate lottery or faro bank, but the con- |
ditions under which it presents itself
are the severest to be found any where j
on earth. Many of those coming in no
doubt are merchants bringing in stocks
of goods'. It may be interesting to them
to know that from a business stand- ;
point Dawson City is now the "deadest*"
town' on the continent and has been for :
months, > and nobody expects' much â¢
change for the better for still other
months. The big prices of last fall
have dropped away, fyyy
There is now a "dime restaurant" in
Dawsonâ not a full meal for a dime, to
be sure, but where any one of a great
variety of dishes of good quality and
quantity, from soup to coffee and the
cigars, may be had at that uniform
price. The four-bit meal has been ad- !
vertised at half a dozen places for a I
long time. Whisky is two bits, and not j
many drunkards at that. Whisky is j
the * thing- that many speculators |
thought to get rich on this year, but |
they all wear the same expression as â 
the luckless layman. Not one of the \
many hopeful corners in provisions j
planned in the fall has proved success
ful, the tendency in prices of every- ;
thing being- down, down, down, until
those who held butter, cream, sugar ,
and other things they had bought at |
high prices to make a corner that re- j
fused to corner have been compelled to j
let go with great loss. |
It is true that much money was made
In the spring and summer by those who j
reached here early with desirable |
goods. But the conditions were pe
culiar last spring, and will be repeated j
this coming spring only in slight meas
ure. Last winter the whole country
here was literally starved out. Bacon'
and beans and flapjacks repeated them- [
selves three times a day on nearly
every table in the . whole district
through the entire winter, and indeed :
he was accounted lucky who had plenty I
of those three. For a long time there j
was not a restaurant open. Afterward <
it became possible to secure a very un
satisfactory meal for 53 50 and $2 50.
All this time gold was being taken out
of the creeks by the handful. When
the ice floated out of the river and im
mediately behind it came the early
merchant with fresh meat, eggs, milk,
vegetables, fruit, nuts and candy, he
found a market, a very eager and hun

thing was straight and he proceeded in
the matter of making a collection, but
failed. He informed Buckley that he
would have to bring suit against Root

an order in favor of Henry for $15. He

fall in this county for the last storm,
getting 4.42 inches. Snow is reported lower
on the Santa Lucia range than it has
been for sixteen years. At Bradley a
small town in the extreme south, the
rainfall was so great that a portion of
the Southern Pacific track was washed

precipitation at the different farming
places in this valley is as follows: Sali

CAYUCOS, March 17.â rainfall for
the storm was 2:09 inches and for the
season 8.87, against 5.90 to the same date

hay and grain. The indications are fa
vorable for more rain soon. The moun
tains are covered by snow.
LOS ANGELES, March 17.â The County
Supervisors are receiving reports from
the county in regard to the effect of the
rain on the crops. The grain crops in the
lowlands, according to the reports, have
been barely saved and In the highlands
are beyond saving. Deciduous fruits have
little chance of gain from the rain, but
the citrus fruit crops with cultivation and
ample irrigation -will .-how a good yieldâ
in the coast regions where fogs have pre
vailed all crops will yield well. The'
storm which has hovered over Southern
California for two days has passed to the
eastward, and only small local showers
may now be looked for, according to the
Weather Bureau. Rain fell at San Diego
this morning, but nowhere else in the
southern part of the State. Up to 12
o'clock the present storm yielded LOB
inches of rain, making the total fall for
the season 3.99. â¢;.":â¢'â  b_ v ,_, ,
ORANGE. March 17.â The rain which
has fallen here has assured a good hay
crop. In the grain section the rain has
been a godsend. The outlook for decid

cipitation was .52 of an inch, making a
total for to-day and yesterday of 1.57

SAYS BABY GRAY
WAS MURDERED
Poison Administered
by Party Unknown.
THE VERDICT IS A SURPRISE
OFFICER HERLIHY GIVES IM
PORTANT TESTIMONY.
Identification Is Positive, but Prose
cution Is Otherwise Weak.
Evidence of the Woman's
Relatives.
We find that said John Richard
Gray came to his death by carbolic
acid poison, administered by parties
unknown to the jury.
Such is the verdict rendered by the jury
in the case of the 2-year-old child of Mrs.
Minnie Adams, whose sudden death un
der peculiar circumstances last Monday
resulted In casting a suspicion of murder
over Its mother and furnished an intricate
problem for the police to endeavor to
solve. The verdict Is unsatisfactory, both
to the detectives who have been working
on the case and to the accused woman.
The former hoped that the jury would
formally charge the woman with the
crime, and the latter was equally confi
dent that she would be completely exon
erated by a verdict of accidental death.
The jury was composed of the following:
J. Joseph (foreman). G. Abrams. W. P.
Emerson. E. A. Husac, George AY. Bergst,
John Glinden. N. L. De Soto and H.
Brown.
The first two. Joseph and Abrams, are
said to have been in favor of charging
the womaji with the murder, but the six
others inclined toward the theory of ac
cidental death, and the verdict rendered
was in the nature of a compromise. The
result of the proceedings will in no way
affect ths course of the police. After the
Coroner had approved the verdict and the
jury had been discharged Mrs. Adams
was taken back to the City Prison and
booked on a charge of murder. She will I
probably be arraigned to-day. Harrison |
Tyrrell; the 10-year-old brother of the
woman, who had been detained as a wit
ness pending the inquest, was discharged
from custody,
. let,' although she is still behind prison
bars and char-ted with the awful crime
of murder, Mrs. Adams is congratulating
-herself on the developments of the in
quest. It is true the testimony of Officer
Herlihv and his positive Identification of
her as" the woman he saw come out of
-Loehr's drugstore at S:ls o'clock In the
evening and tear the label from a bottle
of caÂ« bolic acid as she stood on the curb
stone waiting for a car was very dam-
C 'But' the corroborating circumstances
the corroborating circumstances
which were necessary to make it effective
were lacking aside from the single fact
that Drug Clerk Purlenky swore he sold
a bottle of the poison at the hour stated
by the officer to a woman whose general
a.-jpearance wis somewhat similar to that
of the accused. ' __ .
The report of Chemist Green was simply
to' the effect that he had found traces of
carbolic acid in the scrapings from the
boards taken from the outhouse In the
rear of the Tyrrell residence. Harrison
Tyrrell story of rinding the bottle In a
vacant lot near the house was contradict
ed In a way by Albert Blair, who said he
did not see his playmate pick up the
bottle. Dr. Zabala, who performed the
autopsy, testified that the poison might
have been swallowed in the manner indi
cated by its mother and that the scars
on -his cheeks whicii have caused so much
speculation and comment might have been
caused by wining the poisonous froth
away from the baby's mouth hastily, thus
hinearing it over its face and causing the
superficial scars.
Tho testimony of Wilson Gray, the
father of the child and the first to ac
cuse its mother cf the murder, was close
ly listened to by the jurors, but his man
lier spoiled the natural effect of his
words. Gray has an f unprepossessing ap
pearance, and the animus of his tes
timony was apparent in every word he
uttered. He said that some time ago Mrs.
Adams had told him that the child had
go' hold of a bottle of carbolic acid and*
that she had taken It away from him.
adding, "If he gets hold of another bottle
I will let him drink it."
Gray admitted that he had been repeat
edly rested by the military authorities
while In the army for being drunk and
that he had finally been dishonorably dis
charged from the army. He also admitted
having been arrested on several occasions
by th.c policeâ twice on complaint of the
Voman he now accuses of murder. The
first time she had caused his arrest for
threatening to shoot her with a revolver
and the second time for mashing the fur
niture with an ax. He had been released
on- both occasions because the woman re
fused to prosecute him. He told the jury
hew much he thought of the child and his
voice trembled with emotion when he in
formed the jury that he had contributed
nearly ?5 toward the support of the child
Â«=inee he parted from its mother three
"He called attention to the fact that he
had accused the mother of the murder
when he llrst went to the house in com
pany with an officer on. the night of the
child's death. He had gone to the O Far
fell street station and asked that an ol
fiter be detailed to go to the house with
him' as he was afraid to go alone It
w"s shown by other witnesses that he
had acted in such an unseemly, manner
while Standing by the corpse of his dead
'rou that the policeman was compelled to
rebuke him for his lack or feeling.

ter of' Mi- Adams, made a very favorable

on speaking terms with her sistw lor Aye
of six weeks, but while she old not ap

child with unusual affect on.
â¢ The witness had nothing good to say
cf Gray. To her he was all that
is despicable and disgusting, fa he told
how he had boasted to her tl.a
he would smash the furniture , In
the house in .which be and Mrs. Adams
wore living together and of his carrying
cut his thrcatT She could not recollect
ever having seen him when she thought
he wa.-? sober. She had heard him onone
occasion threaten to blow her sister s
brains cut and he had often addressed hei
with vile language. Finally, after he had
received the note informing him of tne
death of his child, he had come to her
house and said he did not believe it, but
that if the boy was dead that that â â  â
had killed him." -
John Tyrrell Si-, was the most important
witness of the day for the accused woman,
for he testified positively and emphatically,
and his manner and evident sincerity cre
ated a very favorable impression on the
minds of the jurors, that his daughter had
not been out of the house at all last Sun
day evening. He swore that he retired
at 10:30 o'clock that night, and that she
had not left the house up to that time.
In this he was corroborated by the broth
ers of the accused. Every person who tes
tified at the inquest who professed to
know anything about the family agreed
that Mrs. Adams was an unusually fond
mother, and that the dead baby was her
favorite child. Even the vengeful Mr.
Gray could not remember any instance
of her showing any indication of a desire
to be cruel to her offspring, and admitted
that she loved their boy dearly and al
ways took good care' of it.
During the examination of Mr. Tyrrell
he was asked how much Gray contributed
to the support of the baby. He said Gray
had given the boy a five-cent horn and
a ten-cent organ last Christmas, and that
was the only time he had "contributed"
anything, to his knowledge.
Dr. A.fred B. Grosse. 2124 Post street.
claims that another woman purchased
carbolic acid at Loehr's drug store Sun
day night, and that it was this woman
who was seen by Officer Herlinv and not
Mrs. Adams. The doctor is very mys
terious about his a.leged "find." He
claims to have received .ie information
from a lawyer patient of his, and there
fore cannot divulge the source of his In
formation. There is a strong suspicion on
the part of those to whom the physician
has told this tale that he is simply seek
ing notoriety.- but he says the woman who
purchased the poison will be produced
whenever the life or liberty of Mrs.
Adams is jeopardized. As he claims she
would be promptly released If the police
knew what he knows he is certainly a

STOLE A SHEEP.
W. F. Allen Is Tempted to Go Astray
by a Plump Lamb.
W. F. Allen's appetite for beer and his
longing for sheep brought him afoul of
the law last night and now he languishes
in a prison cell and mourns his craving
habits. An additional charge of carrying
burglar tools was placed against him on
the register, as a skeleton key was found
in his possession.
Allen claims he had filled up on beer
and was homeward bound when he espied
a fat sheep hanging outside the Bay City
market. The temptation proved too much
for him and he lifted it from its perch
and walked away with it. Officer L. M.
Benjamin met him. and as he could give
no account of his burden placed Allen un
der arrest. The prisoner claims that he
found the skeleton key four years ago
and used it for opening the back door of
his home on Waller street.

Goethe-Schiller Monument Association
held a meeting last night to prefect the
plans for the erection of the monument In
Golden Gate Park. Charles Bundschu, the
president of the association, announced
that the monument would arrive by rail
.?__ Monday or Tuesday. It had not been
expected so soon and the association be
lieves now that it will be able to have
the. monument in place within a few
months. , __ ... '_- . .
Owing to the fact that the Hamburg-
American Packet Company and the
Southern Pacific Company donated the
freight and that the monument was ad
mitted free of duty, the association finds
that It has on hand $2000. At first it was
intended to have a very plain pedestal,
but with this money a more elaborate
pedestal will be secured. The monument
committee was Instructed to secure sever
al designs for the pedestal and submit
them to the association as soon as pos
sible, f-yfi
The monument is of bronze and an ex
act copy of the Goethe-Schiller monu
ment by Reitschel at. Weimar. It repre
sents Goethe and Schiller standing, the
former with one hand on the shoulder of
the latter and in the other a laurel wreath
which he is presenting to Schiller. Be
fore accepting the monument the asso
ciation had it passed on by Professor
Siemering of the Berlin Academy of Fine
Arts. He pronounced it an excellent piece
of work. .
When the arrangements are all complete
the monument will be placed in Golden

MARTHA FREUDENBERG
WANTS HER CLOTHING
HER MOTHER SAYS NAY AND
THE LAW IS INVOKED.
The Maiden Desires to Get Married,
but Her Mother Bitterly Op
poses the Match.
Martha Freudenberg, a handsome bru
nette who has just reached her majority,
wants to marry Fred Hover, a dealer In
teas and coffee; but her mdther, Mrs. An.
nie Freudenberg of 722 Valencia street,
bitterly opposes the marriage and refuses
to give up her daughter's clothing and
personal effects. Martha reached the
legal age four days ago and left her
mother's house, taking up her tempor
ary residence In the Fulton House on
Larkin street.
Thursday she applied to Judge Graham
for a search warrant to obtain possession
of her effects, but the Judge thought it
would be better first to write her mother
a letter to see if an amicable arrange
ment could not be reached. The letter
whs written and Martha delivered it to
her mother. It had no effect upon the
stern parent, who brusquely Informed
Martha that she would light it out. Yes
terday Martha notified the Judge of the
failure of his good intentions and the
search warrant was issued. Up to last
evening the effects haa not been recov
ered, but Mrs. Freudenberg will have to
submit to the law and give her reasons
in court as to her refusal to hand over
her daughter's personal property.
The difficulties of the situation are that
the wedding cannot take place till the
wardrobe is delivered, as Martha has only
the clothes she is wearing and they are
not suitable for a bride.
A WIFE'S SUICIDE.
Mrs. Lottie Morrison While Tempo
rarily Insane Swallows Car
bolic Acid.
Mrs. Lottie Morrison, the young wife
of John T. Morrison, committed suicide
early yesterday morning at her residence,
1022 Broderick street, by swallowing
part of the contents of a bottle of -car
bolic acid.
Mrs. Morrison was living at the resi
dence with her mother and brother, and
had been nervous and hysterical for sev
eral months. It was said by her relatives
that she had been acting queerly at times
owing to an injury to her head received
in childhood.
Eight months ago her mother fell and
broke her leg, and is now on crutches
owing to the accident. The deceased
labored under the delusion that she her
self had been the cause of the accident to
her mother, and had been â¢ grieving and
brooding over -the matter ever since. Last
Tuesday she bought the bottle of acid
at the drugstore of Alexander D.
Schmidt, corner of Baker and McAllister
streets. She told no one of her intention,
and when she arose yesterday morning
to perform her usual household duties
there was nothing in her manner to at
tract attention or suspicion to her.
She went into her room for a few min
utes, and when one of the inmates went
to call her she was in convulsions. Dr.
C. C. Mohun was summoned, but the
poison had been at work too long and
she expired in about an hour after she
had swallowed the fatal potion.
The husband of the dead woman was
at Los .Angeles on business for the Pa
cific Pump and Windmill Company, and
a telegraphic message was sent to him.
Mrs. Morrison was a native Caiifornian
and 29 years old.

SENT TO PRISON
ON HIS BIRTHDAY
FRANK CUNNINGHAM LAMENTS
HIS MISFORTUNE.
; Seventy-Five Years Old Yesterday
and Disgraced Fall of a
Phrenologist.
â 
Seasoned officers and hard-hearted crim
inals were moved to pity last night at the
sight of Frank Cunningham, a white
haired old Englishman, who wept at the
disgrace of being imprisoned for the first
time in his life on a charge of stealing.
He also wept because he was curtailed
of his liberty on his birthday, he being 75
yesterday. E. J. Marstens was the cause
of his unhappy plight. The latter charged
the prisoner with having stolen a clock
from his office, and is anxious that Cun
ningham should do time for his pecula
tion.
Between sobs he swore that he had nev
er stolen a thing in his life, and was proud
of the fact. He said he felt the keen dis
' grace at being herded among criminals,
! and fervidly declared his innocence. Cun
: ningham admitted a fondness for drink
; and also claimed the proud title of being
; "King of the Drunks/ He also declared
I he earned or paid for every drinK he ever
I had. . , . __
Turnkey Hickey was moved by Cun
j ningham's story and sat close to him. The
elderly prisoner claimed to be a phrenolo
' gist when he worked at it. and asked
| leave to examine Mr. Hlckey's bumps. As
I the latter always has a shaven pate the
! task was comparatively easy for Cun
ningham. He delivered a long disserta
tion on Hickey's cranium, according all
the virtues in the world to the turnkey
and more in the next. He claimed that
I Hickey was never cut out for a policeman,
his proper sphere being a dispenser of jus
tice As Mr. Hickey possessed a bump of
' modesty he sent the gray-headed old man
to his cell. â¢ . â '"*-',; : v
During his slow walk to the 'pen he
still extolled the good qualities of the
kind-hearted turnkey.
FOUND ON A DOORSTEP.
A Two-Week-Old Girl Babe Left at
208 Polk street by an Un
ff-y. known Person.
Wrapped in blankets and covered with
! a soldier's cape, a two-weeks-old girl baby
was left in the doorway of Charles Cohn's
residence at 208 Polk street last night by
some one unknown and Is now in the Re
ceiving Hospital . receiving . the matron's
attention. The little one was left at the
place mentioned shortly after 9 o clock
and was discovered by Charles Cohn. who
went to the door In answer to a ring. He
was astounded at the sight, and fearing
he would be Implicated rushed in search
of an officer. Cohn went to the Southern
Station and Policeman McNamara was sent
with the excited young man. vÂ» ithin a
short time he returned bearing In his
arms the baby. It was a novel sight to
see the warm-hearted officer trying to
stop its crying by crooning the Irish mel
odies he heard earlier in the day. His
efforts in the singing line being una vail-,
ing McNamara administered the bottle of
milk left it by Its hard-hearted parent.
Cohn was extremely nervous over his
find and was loth to have his name mixed
up in the affair. He disclaimed a 1 knowl
edge of the paternity of the child* The
-police have examined the clothes it was
wrapped ln but found no marks of identi
fication. -ffjf^.
THE PURE FOOD BILL.
Efforts lytade to See That It Is Not
Vetoed by the ; Governor.
' One more effort Is to be made to-day to
have the pure-food bill become a law. The
bill as it has passed both branches of the
Legislature differs considerably from the
one proposed by the pure-foods commit
tee of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association. That body suggested that a
special commission or burean be created
to accomplish the end desired, but it was
seen, that the measure would tail in
Sacramento on account of the amount or
money, necessary to maintain such an ad
ditional State institution.
To get over the obstacle it was decided
to place the matter of pure food, etc..
under the direction and management of
the State Board of Health, and in that
form it passed the Senate and Assembly.
In order that the measure may not be
killed by the Governor special commit
tees from the association and from the
State Board of Health go to Sacra
mento this morning to interview the Gov
ernor and endeavor to secure his promise
that he will not kill it when it reaches his
hands.
A Long Way From Home.
The Fish Commissioners yesterday re
ceived another of the marked salmon
which the United States Fish Commis
sioners are watching with so much inter
est. Several years ago the latter cut oft*
the adipose fins of a large number of
small salmon fry in the Columbia River
hatcheries in order to learn of the habits,
age and migrations of the species. The
one received yesterday was from Black
Diamond, on the Sacramento River. The
fish was a female with spawn and
weighed about fourteen pounds.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Math 17.â railways, after
a. display of strength in sympathy with the
buoyancy in sugar, sagged in anticipation of
February returns not meeting expectations, and
the result was marked declines in these proper
ties. a number of the active specialties moved
upward, but some of the "'green" industrials
were exceptions, including Federal Steel.
American Steel and Wire, Continental Tobac
co and International Paper. These properties
suffered because of the diversion of interest
from them to sugar. Sugar. - which at one
time was within 2% points of its record figure
yesterday, scored a net advance of 5 points.
Glucose 'was up sympathetically. The aggre
gate of dealings while below those of yester
day exceed 750.000 shares, of which 139.000 were
sugar. The fact that the banks have lost over
$9,000,000 to the sub-Treasury since Friday led
traders to expect an unfavorable bank state
ment to-morrow, and on this theory they sold
stocks. Among the stocks showing strength
were People's Gas. Tennessee Coal and Iron.
Colorado Fuel and Iron. Metropolitan Street
Railway, Brooklyn Rapid Transit and Man
hattan. Call money rates ranged from 3 to 5.
with the bulk of the business near the higher
figure. After most brokers had made their ar
rangements for loans which carry over until
Monday, rates receded with the closing at 35r

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. March 17.â Commercial
Advertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were slightly more active j
and firmer than during the rest of the week, j
London bought Americans slightly and New
York followed. Then came a sharp relapse
that was accentuated in the street. The market
here thinks the sugar fluctuations frightened
the public out of rails.
Coppers were dull. The fortnightly statistics
show that the supply increased 1.7.77 tons and
stocks 757 tons. Tlntos, 139; Utah-, 6%; Bos

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, March 17.â Bradstreet's review
of the New York stock market will say to
morrow:' Firmer tendencies In money caused
Irregular declines In the stock market during
the earlier part of the week. In spite of this j
there were advances In specialties or manipu
lated securities, and when the' sensation of the !
week came on Thursday it took the form of an i
extremely large and rapid advance In Ameri- j
can sugar refining stocks. The advance con
tinued on Friday, the street being incline I to
believe that the reports of negotiations for a 1
settlement of the trade war had a real foun- I
dation. The absence of any details or con
firmation seemed only to increase the appre- ;
hension of the bears, not only In Sugar but
in other stocks, and although there was little I
evidence- of a healthy buying demand for long
account, the covering of shorts, enforced or
otherwise, caused marked appreciation in va
rious parts of the list.
This was notably the case with Granger
shares, which had been depressed and sagging
early In the week on expectations of unfav
orable net earnings reports for February and
on account of serious damages to the win- ;
ter wheat crop. Burlington, Atchison and
other stocks which would be affected by the
latter circumstance became the objects of
liquidation and pressure, the latter resulting in
.short sales in a sufficient amount to furnish
material for the subsequent rally, which was
helped on by manipulation. At the same time
the entire market was more or less influenced
by the hardening of money. In spite of the
distrust of the industrial stocks shown by
tenders of money, that part of the market was
a feature in the trading. London was not
an Important factor in this market. In fact
the quotations there followed ours closely.
Speculation on the other side was apparently
influenced In Its action by the expectation of
higher money here.
WhHe the anthracite stocks were dull and '
the Grangers heavy until rallied by short cov
ering, the lack of public buying and the pre
dominance of manipulation found their chief
exposition ln the industrial and a few spe- <
cialties.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE. [
NEW YORK. March 17.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow: j
In business this year cannot be compared with I
a year ago. It can be said that payments
through the principal clearing-houses for the
past week have been 57.4 per cent greater than
In 1592 and 45.9 per cent greater than in IS9B,
but that exaggerates the gain In some branches
of business, while in others it falls far short
of the gain. Thus the February exports of
manufactured products have about doubled i
since 1592. Omitting New York 'clearings.
where speculation in stocks is most active, pay
ments through the other principal clearing
houses for tiie same week show an Increase of
37.6 per cent over 1892 and 27.1 per cent over J
last -.ear. But without regard to such details j
all realize that the volume of business is the
greatest ever known.
The national prosperity rests on "more solid*
foundations. The exports of breadstuff^. pro- 1
visions, cotton and oil in February shewed a 1
decrease of $6,000,000, but other exports, mainly
manufactured, were $36,406,043 in value, against
$31,275,396 last year, and were sufficiently large |
to cover 60 per cent of the entire imports. The
merchandise exports for the month were $33,- '
624.117, the gold supply, increasing and there I
appears no occasion for monetary disturbance. j
The Treasury' recorded Its first payment of the
$59,000,000 for the Central Paciflc Railroad, hav
ing previously received $59,000,000 for the Union
Pacific and over $6,000,00 for the Kansas Pa- 1
clflc. '_."_---*
Swiftly rising quotations for iron and Its
products would mislead if It were not kept in j
mind that more than nine-tenths of the iron :
manufacturing capacity is engaged, and will
be until July or later, in the execution of or- j
ders taken months ago at low prices. If a
million tons of products go out this month, i
900,000 tons at such prices as $ls to $20 for steel j
rails, at which the entire output of the Illinois
Steel' Company for this year was sold some time
ago, it hardly Indicates the true character on
the iron business that less than ICO.OOO tons are
going out at such prices as $26 to $2S per ton
for steel rails made here for small lots this I
week. Belated buyers now have to pay fancy
prices to get orders" accepted at all. With- |
drawals of postponement of business because of |
high prices begins to be a significant feature
and much foreign business ls evidently lost,
though there are still sales for exports; 3500
tons of pipe for South America and 3000 tons
bridge material for Burmah.
The Connnellsville Coke Works, with an out
put of 167,240 tons weekly, and many operating
Sundays to catch up with orders, have ad
vanced prices only l.'c
Wool sales at the three chief markets have
been only 4.305,-00 pounds, of which 2,761. 000
were domestic, against 5.075.2C0 In the same
.week of 1592. of which 3.075.000 were domestic:
but prices arc soft and some dealers are said
to have yielded as much as 2Â©3 c per pound
clean because nobody can guess what effect the
new combinations may have. Prices are largely
nominal and yet there is a somewhat better de
mand for goods. Nor has the strong demand
for cotton goods been helped by the weaker
market for cotton, which has fallen to 6.37 cln
spite of a volume of reports about the bad
condition of the late-picked product. The price
of goods has beer, strongly advanced and is
held well, but yet depends on the price of
cotton. . -f.-'f
The market which has lost most is that which
has least statistical reason to lose, because no
estimate of wheat in farmers' hands March 1
would provide more than about the last year's
exports and domestic demand to July 1. The
actual exports, flour Included, from both coasts
during the past two weeks have been 7.596.933
bushels, against 7.376.897 last year. But such
exports imply a foreign demand which is not
unlikely to exceed last year.-, and the corn ex
erts are also a little larger than last year.
The Western receipts .for the week have been
3,359,000 bushels, against 3.557.066 last year.
' Failures for the week have been IS9 in the
I United States, against 208 last year, and 30 in
Canada, against 27 last year.
BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK, March 17.â Bradstreet's to-mor
''â  row will say: An activity which, in some di
â  rections represents the continuance of pre
existing conditions and In others reflects a
special impulse communicated by the near ap
proach of spring, forms the leading note of
this week's trade advices. In the iron and steel
industry activity continues unabated," the up
j ward tendency of prices being strikingly main
! tamed ar.d the eagerness of consumers to take
j the product remaining unchanged.' The more
] spring-like weather has Induced a greater
keenness in the demand for seasonable goods
and from most sections of the country come
; reports of a marked activity in Jobbing .lines
[ having to do with dry goods, millinery and
footwear.
! Cotton fabrics generally are in a strong po
'â  sition. Wool does not display any animation,
' though prices are maintained. The lumber
trade exhibits every Indication of activity, re
ports from widely separated points indicating
a strong demand, more particularly for hard
: woods, which, in some sections, are reported to
i be scarce, high and advancing in price.
The cereals weakened during the week, prob
' ably in sympathy with wheat, which expe
rienced a marked drop on Thursday, in hart as
! the result of liquidation in Chicago and in part
owing to reports of the break of the drought
in California and better news from other wheat
growing sections.
Wheat. Including flour, shipments for the
week aggregated 4,114.046 bushels, against 4,
--398 821 bushels last week. 3.679.0.. bushels In
the corresponding week of 1898, 1.632.434 bush
els in 1597. 1.592,123 bushels In 1596, and 2.9-.'..
--: 635 bushels in ISJS. Since July 1 this season
: the exports of wheat aggregated 177,273,501
bushels against 172.620.770 bushels last year.
Business failures for the week number 205,
an increase of 2S as compared with last week,
i but a noticeable falling off as compared with
1 the corresponding weeks of the four preceding
I years.
Failures in the Dominion of Canada for the
week numbered only 21. as compared with 37
i last week. 23 in the corresponding week of last
year. 36 In 1897. 40 in IS7-6 and 40 in 1595.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. March 17.â The demoralizing feel
ing In wheat which was so general at the close
last night was again the prominent feature at
the commencement of to-day's business. The
early news was quite as discouraging to hold
ers as It was the day before at the opening.
The necessary encouragement of a revival of
export demand appeared as remote as ever,
notwithstanding yesterday's 2c decline. Liver
pool started with quotations from l%d to l%d
below closing figures, and followed that by a
further drop, which brought July to a 2d de
cline. May wheat opened %c to %c lower, at
from 67 3 v down to â¬7%c. and under a good de
mand from shorts Improved to 67% c. At the
slight improvement, how.ever. long wheat
brought once more superabundance. May de
clined to 66% c before shorts were once more
attracted, but both foreign and domestic shorts
came in asain and caused a reaction to 67% c.
May closed at 66%Â©66% c sellers.
The execution by commission houses of stop
loss orders and the weakness in wheat caused
a break in corn at the start. May closed %c
lower. _ . ,-â â¢''
Oats were weak and lower early in sympathy
with wheat, but owing to an excellent demand
from shippers and shorts firmed up and closed
quite strong. May closed ,i@%c higher.
Pressure of long holdings depressed provi
sions. May pork closed 5610 c lower. The
ranse in lard and ribs was narrow.

A GOOD DEMAND FOR CALIFORNIA
PEACHES.
NEW YORK, March 17.â Journal of Com
merce says: The spot supply of peaches Is re
ported to be smaller than at any previous time
at the opening of the spring season. Estimates
as to the quantity available vary, but accord
ing to well-informed parties there are not
much more than six cars controlled by nrst
hands, though some contend the spot stock is
about ten cars. Even at the larger figures it
Is held that the supply is exceptionally small
for this time of year and at the current rate
of demand will be* all absorbed in a few weeks.
Two months ago there was estimated to be ln
first hands here about fifteen to eighteen cars.
In the Interim demands of local consumption,
in connection with brisk Inquiry from the In
terior, has absorbed the bulk of these goods
The Middle West has been a particularly good
buyer and has taken up most of the offerings,
paying full prices. Since early In February
prices have advanced fully 2c per pound in tnis
market and at present the tendency of the
market is decidedly upward, holders of the re
maining stock being indifferent sellers, while
Inquiries from all sources are increasing, as
there is little or no stock to be obtained any
where outside of New York. California advices
are to the effect that there Is little if anything
obtainable there, Chicago has no stock, and
falling to. renew supplies has come here, and
during the past week or ten days has been
one of the chief factors in the reduction of
spot supplies. â¢

LIFE BY DE LUSSAN
Bonnard and Gadski 'Sang and the Pro
duction Was One of Valuable
Record*
By Ashton Stevens.
BRAVO, de Lussan! It was de ]
L-^C Lussan's night at the opera. She '
had the part. Carmen, and she |
*â  played it to the last limit. ; The
crowd was there in fair numbers; the
cast was fine throughout: the. orches- j
tra, under Seppilli, never played better, j
It was a great night. Another great \
night. The resource! of this Ellis com- \
pany seem unlimited, now that th sea
son is decently under way, and they all \
seem to be great nights.
But this production of "Carmen"
must go on record as the only adequate
one we have ever had in San Francis
co. It was staged with elaboration and
attention to' color and detail that would
have done Henry Irving proud; and it
was acted and sung with brilliant tact.
. Bonnard, the indisposed tenor, was
recovered and made his debut In a
ZELIE DE LUSSAN.
stirring performance of Don Jose: Ben
saude, the ever-reliable, was again to
the good, this time as Escamillo: and
the gentle part of Michaela was in no
less hands than Gadski's, and she made
every note of it precious.
It was a notable cast and a notable
performance, but the sensation of the
night was de Lussan. Calve may have
: a better voice, may give to the . part
I vocal blandishments that this young
artist has not at her command; but it
_s not credible that the woman Lives
â¢who can play Carmen as de Lussan
does, with an identity that is impecca
ble. She is a born (Tarmen. She was
Carmen half the twk the other night
" when she played Musette in the "Bo
iheme." and last night she was
Merimme's sultry heroine to the very
life.
Hers is not the Nethersole-Coghlan
.Carmen of shuddering smacks and
. braided limbs. De Lussan does not
: have to resort to oscillatory specialties
â to make the thing seem real. She plays
the part with devilment, insinuation
and a languidly barbaric seduction.
And at the same time the interpreta
tion is so finely suggested and shaded
that any young man might with im
munity take his parents to see it.
The fact that De Lussan is an Ameri
can girl need not disparage her triumph.
With the proper encouragement there
is no reason why we should not breed
a race of dramatic singers of our own
and keep some of these altitudinous
opera salaries at home. With Nordica,
Sanderson. Nevada, de Lussan and a
; few others to reckon on already, the
possibility does not seem so remote,
either. Anyway, de Lussan was a
â¢credit to her country last night. She
â worked the audience up to the top
potoh of enthusiasm. Bouquets were
thrown in bunches on the stage, one
of the smartest coming from Melba,
Who sat in a bc-x and applauded sonor
ously in that long, Blow, whole-arm way
of hers. I dare say I made a mistake
the other day in listening to the gos
sip about professional jealousy in the
'"Boheme" performance. Melba's en
iovment of De Lussan was as keen as
my. own; or else she is a better actress
than I think she is.
7 It Is not necessary to catalogue the
vocal gems of de Lussan's perform
ance. To say that she sang the Hava
naise with brilliant insolence, the
Seguidella with arch Insinuation, and
so forth and so forth, would be taking
things from the wrong point of view.
As a matter of course she sang all of-
Carmen's music just, as it should â  be
sung. That was part of her business.
But it was not this bit of singing nor
that bit of acting alone that gripped
vÂ«; it was the cumulative strength of
the impersonationâ its beautiful pro
portion, consistency racial tang and
realism. In her hard-heeled stride, her
swagger and abandon, her passion and
her disdain she was ever the untamed
creature cf Prosper ilerimme. Even
in acknowledging the applause of the
' audience she did not step out of the j
character. From the first instant of j
reckless coquetry in the opening act to j
the wildly tragic end at the Plaza de
Torreo, she was Carmen. De Lussan's
work was a masterpiece in voluptuous
characterization.
The Ellis company runs to tall tenors. j
Bonnard. like Ceppi. is life sized. The â 
brim of his hat is, I should say, a good :
six feet above ground. And he has the j
voice in proportion, a lyric tenor cap- .
able of urgent dramatic work as well
as of sweet sound. In the first act Bon- |
nan! acted well but sang badly; in the j
second he sang betterâ he was suffering
a recovery. Then as he warmed to his ;
work his throat thawed and the notes j
came full and firm. In the. exciting
scene of the last act he was at his best,
and a splendid best it was. After last .
' night's Don Jose we can expect much
of Bonnard.
It is very seldom that a great so
prano sings the part of Michaela. al
though the aria in the third act is per
haps the most exalted individual song
that Bizet ever wrote. But the part is
more or less subsidiary and the big
singers usually are willing to stay out
of the cast and leave everything to
Carmen it was an event to hear an
artist like Gadski in Michaela. She
never for a moment tried to make more
of the part than there is in it. She
sang unobtrusively, beautifully, with
an almost Mozartian ingenuousness.
What a reproach is this woman's ex
quisite tone and technique to those be
lated pessimists who say that Wagner
ruins a good voice!
Bensaude, the indispensable, fur
nished a valiant Escamillo. His voice
on this, the fifth night, was as fresh
as at the beginning of the season â in
deed his Toreador song was rouslngly
given â and he played with grace and
dash. The choruses were well, keyed
up to the spirit of the piece and Sep
pilli and the band made the most of
Bizet's dazzling orchestration. An ap
preciation of this record performance
of "Carmen" would not be complete
without a mention of Mr. Parry, the
stage manager. Not only were his
settings a series of admirable pictures,
but the manner in which he grouped
and shuffled his people showed the hand
of an artist.
HACK SYSTEM WORKS WELL.
Monday Night, However, Will Be the
Supreme Test.
The system for hacks conveying patrons
to the Grand Opera worked with less,con
fusion last night than on the night of Its
Inauguration. In fact, it may be said to
be operating like a charm. Sergeant
Gorman is jubilant. The audience seemed
to fully understand the system, and after
passing out, dividing into three bodies,
was quickly picked up and driven away,
leaving the block deserted within fifteen
minutes after the curtain had dropped on
the last act. ' .
Next Monday, night will be the supreme
test. The police will have charge of the
private carriages and those belonging to
companies outside of the combination and
those who make their way to the main
entrance." The hack Inspectors will man
age the hacks on the other entrances, and
all are confident of success. It Is be
lieved that fully six hundred vehicles will
form the lines on that night. Half the
confusion would not have occurred on
Wednesday evening were it not for the
heavy rain, which compelled every car
riage to pass under one awning.

DEATH RATHER THAN DISEASE.
Rose Mahoney Deliberately Undertakes to Join
the Great Majority.
DISCOURAGED by sickness and Imagining that her relatives had dis
owned her, Rose Mahoney, a young woman 21 years of age. attempted
to commit suicide yesterday morning in her room, at 8 Gough street by
swallowing the contents of a bottle intended for external use and which
she had been warned was poison. To mark her identity she had written on
one side of a piece of paper, "Cause, sickness: name. Rose Mahoney," and on
the other side. "Mrs. J. F. Lane, 308 Hill street, my sister." 'â â¢-'
She was taken to the Receiving Hospital, where the usual remedies were
administered by Its. Weil and Rinne. and she was soon; pronounced, out of
danger. When able to talk she explained that she got the medicine from a
specialist on Market street who had been treating her for.several weeks. It
was a solution of carbolic acid. She had been- doing housework up to two
weeks ago, but had to discontinue owing to her illness. 'Since then she had
been living with friends in Oakland. She stated that her sister, Mrs. Lane,
would not keep her. and on Thursday night she engaged the room at 8 Gough
street, where her father formerly lodged, with the intention of taking the poi
son and ending her troubles. * :..'-'. ' '.".
Mrs. Lane was notified and hurried to the hospital. She was shocked to find
her sister in such a condition, and said she would take her home as soon as
she was able to be removed. Mrs. Lane had not seen Rose for three months,
and at that time she reprimanded her for her conduct wilh a young man and
warned her that if she did not give him up she could not make her home with
her. Rose did not heed the warning and the sisters parted. - ' â > .

MRS. DOLLIE CARTWRIGHT
CAPTURES TWO BURGLARS
MRS. DOLLIE CARTWRIGHT, who
keeps a lodging house at 1027% Mar
ket street, gave evidence of the fact
yesterday morning that she la a
plucky little woman by capturing two
burglars and holding one of them till a
; policeman arrive?., notwithstanding his
efforts to break away from her grasp.
About 11 o'clock she had occasion to go
I from the kitchen to one of the room*.
j and as she emerged from the sitting room
i she was confronted by a shabbily dressed
! man who asked her if Mrs. Griffin lived
| there. She told him that Mrs: Griffin
j had not been there for some time, and
| just then another man ran out of her
j bedroom, the door of which was close to
! where they were -standing, and started
; downstairs, followed by his friend.
j, Mrs. ; Cartwright suspected that some
| thing was. wrong and. she ran Into her bed
â¢ room and discovered that her silver toilet
I set had been tampered with and the pow
j der box was missing. She hurried after
the two men and caught one of them by
the coat tails just as he reached the foot
of the stairs. He struggled to get away,
but she got ft firm grasp on his coat col
lar and dragged him upstairs. He made
several attempts to escape, but finding it
useless he begged for mercy. Policeman
Chase. was notified and on searching the
burglar the silver powder box was found
in his pocket and an empty quart bottle
which the police think was intended for
use as a club by the burglar.
When Chase reached the sidewalk with
his prisoner, Mrs. Cartwright pointed out
the other burglar, whose curiosity had
brought him back, and she held him til!
Chase handcuffed him to his companion.
He remarked: "This house must be
watched to let them catch you so quick."
They were sent to the City Prison, where
a charge of burglary was placed against
them. The, silver powder box was booked
as evidence. "
Their names are Paul Kennedy and
William Harris, and they are genuine
specimens of the genus hobo. It is - not
the first time they have been arrested.
They claimed that they were window
cleaners and went to the house to ask
for a job. and finding the bedroom door
open Kennedy walked in while Harris
kept watch outside, but they had no in
tention of stealing anything.

BRANDES TELLS
HOW LILLIAN'S
BODY WAS FOUND
Says He Is innocent
of Wrong. v
MAKES AN ATTEMPT TO FAINT
APPEARANCE OF HIS FIRST
WIFE RATTLES HIM.
tChe Accused Swears That He Was
Not Cruel and That He Never
Struck the Hapless
Girl.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 17.
When the trial was resumed this morn-
Ing Mrs. Etta Brandes was further cross
examined by District Attorney Allen, who
continued his questions as to witness'
relations with Brandes. Mrs. Brandes
had just declined to answer to a question
; as to whether or not her name Is Mrs.
(Etta Brandts when the District Attorney
â asked:
\ "Is it not a fact that your name is not
.Mrs. Brandes but Etta Crown and that
you are unmarried?"
Mrs. Brandes caught her breath, fal
tered and looked for sympathy to her at
torneys, who entered a vigorous objection.
[Witness "was not required to answer.
Mrs. Brandes was then cross-examined
et length regarding the noises she heard
in the house on Saturday morning, the
day of Lillian's death.
She was unable to describe the exact
character of the sounds. "1 can only
say," continued the witness, "they were
loud noises." When Mrs. Brandes went
to investigate she had found Lillian hang
ing to the bedpost and saw froth on the
girl's lips. Yet according to her previous
testimony she had said she thought the
girl was fooling. Witness could not ex
plain why she thought so. She had
â¢'turned the body around twice only to
look at It," but made no effort to take
the body down, and did not remember
why she had not tried to untie the knot.
"My memory Is sometimes good, some
times poor," said witness. "Since I went
to the County Jail it has been poor."
Another serious contradiction in Mrs.
Brandes' testimony is that at one time she
stated that the girl's body hung clear of
the floor. To-day she swore *._*<_ feet were
below the mattress.
Juror Sieben asked Mrs. Brandes if she
had requested her husband to remove the
girl from the house and if she was glad to
get rid of her. The witness tersely re
plied: "Yes, 1 was."
William A. Brandes, the accused, was
then sworn and took the stand. He gave
his age at about 3Â« years. Lillian was his
laughter, who before she latterly came to
Ive with him resided at Monterey with
an aunt. "At least." said witness, "she so
wrote in several letters." He told of hav
ing sent her $1 50 each month for a year.
The date of the Tuesday on which the girl
is alleged to have been beaten witness
"did not remember," nor the date of her
death, only it was Saturday. He had pro
posed to send her back to her aunt's on
that day because she and his wife did not
get along. The rent moneyâ slsâ was to
be used partly for her fare. Lillian knew
where it was kept. On the Sunday prior
to her death the family went buggy rid
ing, and "there was a row."
"I concluded there had been enough
Tows," continued Brandes, "and decided
to send her away. On Monday night I
â went on my beat. 1 returned about 1
o'clock Tuesday morning and found Lil
lian sitting up ln the kitchen reading
newspapers. She begged me not to send
her away. I told her Mrs. Brandes had
accused her of hiding the money. I knew
If she had she would tell me where it was.
Just then I heard a noise in my bedroom.
"We went into the bedroom and found Mrs.
Urandes spanking the boy. I concluded
we'd find the money later. I never beat
Lillianâ l never struck her In my life. I
thought more of her than of any of the
family, and I never chastise In my home.
I could not have made a statement to
Harvey that I beat her."
Brandes then recited at length the story
of the search on Tuesday for the money;
how he emptied Lillian's trunk and after
ward drew it down stairs to his office,
making a noise. Witness admitted that
he usually talked loud. While testifying
â¢he spoke almost In a whisper at times,
and Attorney Melvln remarked that he
â wished Brandes would "give a sample of
his vocalization now." The prisoner wen'
on to relate that he had seen Lillian on
the following Wednesday. Thursday and
Friday and uiat she showed no symptoms
of pain, headache, fever or stupor.
Deputy District Attorney Melvln com
menced the cross-examination rather
mildly, but before he had concluded .for
the day he had Infused a new spirit Into
the accused man. At one stage he bad
Brandes Illustrate by means of a door
representing the head of Lillian's bed
just how he had found the body. This
â¢was exceptionally Interesting-, though
Brandes' explanations contained discrep
ancies.
"Her face was against the bedpost." ;
explained BrandeÃ, "and the apron was i
tied around the post, which protrudes
about two Inches above the headboard. j
The other end of the apron was tied about
the girl's neck. The knots were about six
inches apart, and the lower knot was to- !
ward the back of Lillian's neck. I im- j
mediately grabbed the body with both
hands and lifted It. No. the loop did not i
slip over the bedpost. I untied the neck j
loop. Just how I don't remember."
While Attorney Melvln had the apron j
nround his neck to aid Brandes in his
illustrations Juror F. A. Randlett I
startled the witness by asking:
"Can't you tie the same kind of a knot
in that apron now that you untied at
that time?" Brandea hesitated a moment !
and replied that he "would not swear"!
that he could.
"When 1 had done all I could for her."
continued the witness, "1 rushed into j
Harvey's room and asked him to go after
a doctor, but he refused, saying he pre- i
lied not to get mixed up In such an
affair." -â  'â¢
Brandes admitted that be had told
Deputy Sheriff White on the Sunday of i
his arrest thai the man who left his
house Saturday morning was * Frank I
Thompklns, when he well knew it was
Harvey.
"I did this," said Brandes, "because I
knew White was not .there for any good
of mine. I also knew that I had been ar
rested by Marshal Lloyd, one of my
worst enemies, nod I didn't want to talk
too much before seeing my attorneys."
Brandes denied that he had asked
Deputy Coroner Strelghtlf to "be easy on
him" in relation to the black and blue
marks found on the girl's body. "We ;
had been talking about the funeral ex- j
penses." said Brandes, "and I asked hint
to be easy on that account, for I am a. !
poor man." - - â 'â Tr? ._,'_.__
In another breath Brandes said be flrst :

cause the poison bottle was missing. She |
had talked of using poison and he saw
' froth on her lips. Ho denied that there
-were marks on the girl when he found |

theory of the defense that the marks
were "post-mortem.

MME. JAQUAY
DOES NOT FEAR
A WARRANT
Said to Hold Many
Secrets.
i
DR. SHARPE HAS GONE EAST
TRIED TO BORROW MONEY FOR
THE TRIP.
Two People Accused of Murder Ap
pear to Anticipate No Incon
venience From the
Law.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
906 Broadway, March 17.
There is little fear of Dr. C. J. Sharpe
and Mme.. Jaquay being arrested on
charges of alleged murder. They have
too many friends in Oakland who are
anxious that they shall not be brought to
trial.
Although the two alleged murderers are
wanted for different cases, it is now
learned that they have long worked to
gether and that the home of the madame
ln East Oakland was practically an at
tachment of the doctor's establishment on
"Washington street.
Dr. Sharpe may have passed through
Texas recently, but that place is not his
destination. He left Oakland for New
York, and has probably arrived there long
before now, perhaps before the warrant
for him was issued.
Before leaving this city he went to a
woman who frequently acted as' nurse
ln his cases and asked for the loan of
some money. He acknowledged being ln
a tight place and said that If he could
reach New York he would be safe. He
said that he had been assured of a good
situation there and intended to take it.
Sharpe fully realized his danger and be
fore leaving referred to the fact that he
had little chance of escape in the face of
the testimony given at his trial a year
ago for the murder of Anna Johnson.
Mme. Jaquay has been following her
pernicious calling for some years in this
city, but has enjoyed immunity from the
law because she had several doctors of a
certain class among her patrons. These
doctors refused to accept cases involving
the commission of a crime, but had no
scruple about referring patients to the
madame.
Mme. Jaquay was not so discreet with
her tongue as might be supposed from
the dangerous and illegal nature of
her business, and many things told by her
in confidence are now being freely dis
cussed.
In the case of the treatment of a young i
I servant girl In Alameda it is said that |
'â  Mme. Jaquay is responsible for the girl j

; The child was either born dead or died I
. soon after its birth. At least, that is the I

for Its disappearance. As the mother had
heard her babe crying some hours after

HIS DESIRE WAS REALIZED.
| Philip Cockran Swallows Carbolic
Acid to Escape Suffering.
OAKLAND, March 17.â Dr. O. D. Ham
lin conducted an autopsy to-night on the
body of Philip Cockran, who was found
dead in bed at his home, 1517 Seventh
street, this morning. The autopsy re
vealed that some time during last night
deceased had taken a dose of carbolic,
acid. 'As a result Coroner Mehrmann will
hold an Inquest to-morrow night.
Cockran had been a sufferer from ec
zema for a long time, It had -been his
custom for some time past to apply to
one of his limbs a poultice of fat satur
ated with carbolic acid. Yesterday he
called on his butcher as usual for the fat,
and on his way home purchased a small
bottle of carbolic acid.
Before deceased retired last night he
closely scrutinized a large picture of him
self which decorated his room, and, turn
ing Its face to the wall remarked to his
wife as she was about to leave the room
to retire to her chamber, "1 wish that I
was dead." These were the last words
Mrs. Cockran heard from her husband's
lips. When she went to his bedside this
morning to arouse him he was dead, but
not until the autopsy so revealed was it
supposed that he had committed suicide.
Deceased was a native of Ireland/aged
52 years. For many years he was in the
employ of the Southern Pacific .as : flag
man at First and Franklin streets. He
leaves, besides his widow, several grown
up children. 'xY^i '-.â  *?

Largest Orchardists in Alameda
County to Follow a Plan That
Has Been Successful in
the South. j
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. March 17.
For the first time in Alameda County
sewage Ib to be utilized for fertilizing pur
poses. A contract has been entered into
between the Meek Brothers of San Le
andro and the Town Trustees of Hay
wards by which the well-known orchard-
Ists pay $25 per year for the privilege of
utilizing the town's sewage.
The matter was thoroughly discussed
at a meeting of the Town Trustees last
night. The Meek Brothers explained the
manner in which they would carry out
their contract. They will make connec-
tions with the main sewer at Alice street
and from there will conduct the sewage
through a wooden culvert to their prop
erty. An apparatus will be constructed
enabling the orchardists to pump the
I sewage to a sufficient height to enable it
I to be carried to their orchards and fields.
The contractors declare that the ex
pense of thus disposing of the town sew
age will not be over $3000. Some of the
residents of the neighborhood made ob
jection that there would be offensive
odors and that the sewage matter would
breed malaria and other diseases. It Is
asserted by the Meek Brothers that there
ls no foundation for this objection, as
' the sewage amounts to only 200 inches a
minute in the conduit and this is mixed
with 3000 inches of water. Before under
taking this project an examination was
made of similar plans now being worked
in Los Angeles, where the sewage is sold
to the farmers and fruit growers of the
surrounding country.
In the contract made with the town of
Haywards, the Meeks agree to see that
at the end of five years the sewer pipes
of the town are in as good sanitary con
dition as they are at present. This ex
periment by the largest fruit growers In
this county will be watched with great
interest, as there are many other small
towns, the sewage of which could be em
ployed In the same manner fertilize
,-cd ln the same manner to fertilize
surrounding orchards. â __
UNIVERSITY OF
CALIFORNIA NEWS
Students Will Appeal to the Board of
Regents for a New System of
Student Finances.
BERKELEY', March 17.â question
jof student finances came up before a
| meeting of the Associated Students this
'â¢ morning. As the result of a long dis
cussion of the subject it. was decided to
j attempt immediately a radical measure
'< of reform. - '.;â¢-*. . .
Heretofore the college men have met
' the expenses of such things as debates
! and football rallies by a blundering sys
! tern of popular subscriptions. The method
> has proved Itself unsatisfactory to the
i last degree. Periodic efforts to meet out
standing debts by assessments which
: could not be enforced have only left the
â  treasury continually empty. As lt now
i stands the treasurer has on hand only
i $39 to meet expenses which will amount
: to over $150 before the end of the term.
For a long time the students have felt
, the pressing need of a change, and this
morning the feeling came to a head ln a
, resolution presented at the Associated
' Students' meeting. This measure invokes
j the help of the board of regents. It pro
â  vides for a petition to be presented to
! that body asking It to impose a fee of 25
cents a * year upon every student who
registers for university work. The sum
so collected, amounting roughly to $400 a
year, would be placed at the disposal of
the students, to be drawn upon as occa
sion required. No one would be allowed
. to register for a college course without
i previously paying his share of the ex-
I penses involved by the student body. Ad
! vocates of the plan "claim that it would
i distribute the burden of expense evenly,
j at the same time providing amply for all
- current debts.
A majority of the college men favor the
measure, and the board of- regents will be
, urged to make it official.
It was decided at a meeting of the ex
j ecutive committee of the athletic asso
i ciation to-day to have the cinder track
I on the campus fenced in and improved.
The committee voted a sum of $175 for the
| purpose. _ _ â 
DREDGING JOKER.
Work on Lake Merrltt Will Not Be
Stopped and Must Be
Paid For.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 17.
The dredging on Lake Merrltt will not
be stopped on account of litigation. This
morning Judge Greene granted City At
torney de Golla a writ of mandate com
pelling the City Treasurer to pay the In
stallment for the dredging due on the con
tract.
City Attorney Dow agrees with the con
tractors' attorney that everything is In
proper legal shape and there is no reason
why the work should not proceed and the
payments be regularly made.
There is a joker somewhere in the Lake
Merrltt opposition. Some weeks ago one
Ruppert applied for an injunction on the
ground that the contract was not legal.
No effort has been made to obtain the
injunction, or to enforce it, and the con
tractors' attorney declares that Ruppert
Is merely a figurehead for some one inter
ested in blocking the progress of the Im
provements. If the money be not paid
by Thursday morning Treasurer Gilpin
must appear before Judge Greene and
give his reasons for non-compliance with
the court's order.

POLITICS IN ALAMEDA.
Many Voters Disfranchised Through
Some One's Blunder.
ALAMEDA, March 17.â The politician*
of this city received a shock to-day when
it was learned that a large number of
voters who had moved from one precinct
to another without being transferred on
the Great Register would be disfranchised
at the city election. Whether County
Clerk Jordan is to blame or whether re
cent amendments passed by the Legis
lature are responsible is not certain. Reg
istration closed here to-day. Many who
applied for transfers were informed by
the Deputy County Clerks that such ac
tion was not necessary and that if they
had lived in the voting precinct thirty
days prior to election their ballots would
be received by the Election Board, pro
vided their names appeared on the Great
Register of the county. This -afternoon,
however, the clerks received word from
Mr. Jordan that the interpretation of the
law was all wrong and that those who
had not been transferred could not vote
at the city election.
W. B. Hinchman has practically suc
ceeded H. A. Thompson in the manage

tion. To get around the unpleasant duty
of electing a new presiding officer, the

Mr. Hinchman selected to fill it.
Senator E. K. Taylor, candidate for City

DEL MONTE. March 17.â matter of
constitutional amendments came up to
: day at the flrst session of .the Board of

-. Two amendments were passed which
; mean much to the management of fire in

j pecially with regard to companies that

! first provides that a principal representa-
I tive or general manager may represent

ARMY BEEF COURT
AT KANSAS CITY
Inspection of Armour's
Plant.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY, March 17.â The army
beef court of inquiry arrived here from
Omaha at 6 o'clock this morning and
was quartered in the Midland "Hotel.
During the morning an hour and a half
was spent in inspecting the Armour Pack
ing plant, from which more than 1,000,000
pounds of canned roast beef was sold to
the Government during the recent war.
In the afternoon two hours and a half
were spent in examining witnesses.
Soon after the court's arrival here this
morning a brief session was held. It was
decided that as the Armour Company was
the only local flrm that had supplied meat
to tho army, its plant alone, should be
visited. The party was driven to the
plant in carriages at 10 o'clock. "William
M. Miles, general manager, and Superin
tendent Tourtellot piloted the party
through the different parts, each of
which, with the exception of the killing
room, which was not visited, was inspect
ed critically. They watched the .process
of canning, sterilizing and roasting. The
foreman declared no preservatives had
ever been used in canning the roast beef.
The court returned to the hotel at noon
and began taking testimony at 2:15. Sev
eral witnesses were examined. To-mor
row further evidence will be taken, and
later, probably to-morrow afternoon, the
court will go to Fort Leavenworth, Kan.,
and take testimony of- some of the regu
lars recently returned from Cuba.
William M. Miles, general manager of
the Armour plant, was the first witness
called. He said his company had supplied
I** the Government 1,000.000 pounds of
canned roast beef during the war. It was
sold to Commissary General Eagan at
Washington and Commissary Woodruff at
New York. The meat was inspected at
Mobile and other points of delivery In the
South. Two carloads were returned from
Mobile and three carloads from Jackson
ville. On its return to Kansas City the
company inspected the meat and found
that less than one-half of one per cent
was bad. That from Mobile, the witness
said, had never been inspected there. The
returned meat was nut back Into stock and
"possibly some of it resold to the govern
ment." One portion of It was resold to a
foreign Government and accepted.
Ex-Congressman Mason S. Peter, who
was formerly in the livestock commission
business in Kansas City, and Lionel A.
Lennin, a commission man, defined "can
ners" as quoted in the dally market re
ports. H. L. Antone. foreman at Ar
mour's canning department, told of his
department working night and day during
May and June, 1898. to fill the Govern
ment's orders. Because of the big demand
for "canners" it was necessary to kill
fresh cattle of a higher grade than usu
ally used. Notwithstanding the rush,
proper precaution in packing was taken
and all cans were Inspected four times
before they left the plant. The rejections
amounted to one-half of one per cent.
L. T. Rambo swore that in June, IS9S,
he was in the employ of the Armour Com
pany and helped in the canning depart
ment. He frequently nailed up cases.
Cans would often swell up and burst. In
reply to a question, witness declared
that some days as much as a third of
the cans prepared were rejected for this
and other reasons. ._.____.
Mr. Antone was recalled and denied
that Rambo had worked in the canning
department at the time stated or that the
number of cans rejected reached the
amount alleged by Rambo. Antone said
that a record was kept of all cans re
jected and the court Instructed him to
bring this record before it to-morrow.
S. B. Morse, who has charge of the
killing at Armour's, said that all cattle
passing through his hands bore tags
showing governmental inspection. He
had no knowledge of chemicals being
used in preserving meats, and said It
could not have been so used without his
knowledge.
Dr. S. E. Bennett of the Bureau of An
imal Industry in - Kansas City, and
Thomas W. Carmichael, a Government
meat Inspector, said the proportion of cat
tle rejected because of disease or for
other reasons was from one to nine a
dayâ rarely as high as eight.
John Spence, foreman ofthe cutting de
partment, testified as to the good quality
of cattle used for canning. -
Dr. Ernest W. Slusher, hospital stew
ard of the Third Missouri Volunteers,
said that while stationed at Fort Meade.
Pa., he was one morning called to attend
fifty members of the regiment who were
vomiting. It was his opinion they had
been made sick by/eating spoiled canned
corned, beef. The 'matter was not inves- I
tigated, The cans, he thought, bore the
label of Libby. McNeill & Libby.
Carl Holtzschue. a member of Troop A,
First United States Volunteer Cavalry.
smlxl there was no complaint of the canned
roast beef served on the voyage from
Tampa to Cuba. In Cuba, up to June 22,
each soldier received a can of roast beef
and one pound of bacon, with potatoes
and bread, as three days' rations, and
there was no complaint. Later, at Camp
Hamilton, some of the refrigerated beef
was tainted and had to be thrown away.

to have a free postal delivery, the first in
that State. This was decided by the
Postoffice Department to-day. Carson City
people also asked this for their town, but
as their -postal receipts are only about
$7000 per annum this cannot be done, ac

SHOOTING AFFRAY
Tragedy Follows a Fist
Fight.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KESWICK, March 17.â At Iron Moun
tain Frank Persing, a boy aged 1,7, shot
Crozier A. McCandliss this afternoon.
A bullet from a 44-caliber revolver
passed through McCandliss' body over
the heart, grazed his spine and cut a
gash from the arm erf a bystander. Mc-
Candliss this evening is still alive, but
two attending physicians say he cannot

known as "Mother Bailey" and keeps a
resort next to McCandliss' saloon. To
day by agreement Oakey and Isaac Mc-
Candliss had a fist fight. Oakey brought
Frank Persing along to see that he had
fair play and armed Persing with a re
volver. As Oakey was getting the worst
of the encounter Persing interfered.
Crozier McCandliss brushed Frank
aside, telling him to mind his own
business. Persing then fired and Mc-
Candliss fell. George Lowe, barkeeper
for McCandliss, fired two shots at Per
sing as he fled. They went wide of the
mark. _
Thomas Oakey accompanied Persing
'to the mountains, taking guns and am
munition with him. Constable Kelly of
Keswick was sent for. He, with a
posse, searched the -mountains Tor two
hours to no purpose. All outlying points
j have been notified and the fleeing crimi-
I nals probably will be caught eventually.
Secretary of Agriculture "Wilson
gives some very important advice to
American Farmers in next Sunday's
Call.

GAMBLERS WERE FREE
A FEW BRIEF HOURS
An Injunction Released the Grip of
the Law and Advantage Was
Taken by the Bookies.
Modification Was Quickly Made by Judge Daingerfield
and Again Gloom Pervaded the Betting Ring.
Cases of Law-Breakers Called in Court.
FOR a few brief hours yesterday a
battle of the law against the law,
civil against criminal, made free men
. of the hordes of Ingleside. Gamblers
plied their trade with that reckless %peed
which manifests knowledge that the time
to reap is limited. An Injunction on be
half of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club has
been obtained against Chief Lees and his
host of bluecoats under circumstances
that did not savor of an effort on behalf
of a just cause, 'and for a time the law
making gambling at the course a crime
was practically suspended.
It was at an early hour when those
who guide the destinies of the big track
began to move and swing tieir forces In
line for an assault upon the law directed
against them and their ilk. Shortly after
court convened Attorney Henry Ach ap
peared before Presiding Judge Danger
lield and tiled a complaint for an injunc
tion to restrain Chief Lees and his sub
ordinates from interfering with the regu
lar routine of programmed racesâ in other
words; to compel all officers sworn to up
hold the law to violate their oaths and
permit the bookies to occupy themselves
as they did when no law prohibited.
In the. complaint there is a wall of in
jured innocence, a protest that is despair
and which. seems to stamp the document
as the last nostrum administered in the
forlorn hope of saving a dying industry.
Stripped of its legal verbiage, its title and
prelude reads: f-Yfy â ' ' : :.-
Prior to and Including the 14th day of March,
IS9St, and ever since . the year issr, this cor
poration has been conducting race meetings in
a quiet and -orderly . manner , at its race, track,
and derived a large source of revenue and profit
therefrom, and from the admission fee charged
for the purpose of witnessing the races, at times
exceeding JSOOO a day. All. of the defendants
in this action are police officers In the city and
county of San Francisco. . Plaintiff has upon
Insleside race track a large amount of per
sonal property. of a value exceeding $20,000,
necessary' to. Its business. ..-..â '
On the Hth day of March. 1899, .'he associa
tion had upon its race track, knuv'n as Ingle
side race track, a large amount of personal
property necessary to carry on its .business.
That on the 14th day of March, 1599. the de
fendants, in a body and in uniform, did, against
the will of the plaintiff and without its invita
tion, and without purchasing ticket and with
out offering to pay for their -lesion, and
without warrant or process of law, march lnand
upon the premises of the plaintiff and scatter
lis patrons against the will and consent of the
plaintiff, and appropriate- mucn of the personal
property of this plaintiff and other persons,
who had a right in and upon the premises and:
race track, and that this was d?ne without
process of law, without notice and without
prior demand.
On the loth day of March, 1899, the same per

or process of law, did march in and upon said
premises of the plaintiff herein, without the
consent of the plaintiff, and against its will,
without paving any admission fee, and ln full

them to leave said premises. Neither of said

Wherefore, the plaintiff prays that the deA

honorable court from entering ln or upon the
Ingleside race track against the desire or the
will of the plaintiff In aXbody, or as police
officers, without warrant \or due process of

Accompanying the complaint was a pre
pared writ for the signature of the court
and Immediately upon the undertaking of
a bond in the sum of $5000, upon which
J. M. Rothschild and Manuel Casey ap
peared as sureties, the court affixed his
signature and Ach hurried to serve It
upon Chief Lees and his subordinates.
This writ is as follows:
"Whereas, On the 17th day of March. 1899, an

After the writ of injunction had been
served upon Chief Lees and things again
opened up on the floor around the book
stands the squad of policemen who have
been invading the betting ring arresting
those who violated the new betting ordi
nance were lounging outside the gates of
the race track awaiting the next move.
The news that Chief Lees had been tem
porarily restrained from interfering was
generally known among the bookies long
before the flrst race, but none of them
attempted to open their books or do busi
ness from their blocks, even though the
police were not on hand. Hand booking
was carried on during the flrst three
races at a startling gait, however, but
then. came the end. Judge Daingerfield
had modified the Injunctions and the
hours of freedom had flown.
Immediately after Chief Lees had been
served he returned to the city and con
sulted with District Attorney Murphy ahd
Attorney Garret McEnerney. At th*
opening of the afternoon session of the
court Mr. McEnerney, District Attorney
Murphy, Chief Lees, Captain W ittman
and various members of the police squad
appeared in Judge Dalngerfield's court
and. asked that the Injunction be modi

the court as to the existing conditions
at the track and Judge Daingerfield
promptly took up the work of modifying
the injunction. When this was com

pleted the new injunction was taken into
court and Mr. McEnerney said: yyffff^
If the court please, I appear on behalf of
the defendants in the case of the Paclllc Coast
Jockey Club vs. Lees, a matter that has been
before your Honor in chambers, and we ask
that the Injunction be modified in accordance
with the form prepared by your Honor and
dictated to the official stenographer of this
court, and that an order be made to that effect
in open court. Â '..
"Very well, that will be done," said the
court, "the form of the order has already been
prepared." This closed the incident.
A comparison of the original with the
modified injunction will demonstrate even
to the lay mind the great difference as
to the extent of their restraining effect.
The modified injunction is as| follows:
Whereas, On the 17th day of ..Arch, 1899, an
order was made by the Superior Court of the
city and county of San Francisco, State of

Before the ink was yet dry upon the
modified Injunction Chief Lees addressed
Judge Daingerfield and asked permission
to proceed. "You have heard the Injunc
tion read since lt has been modified said
the court, "and you may proceed. Keep
within the law In the pursuit of your
duties," added/ Mr. McEnerney. I al
ways do that/ said the Chief, and with
his subordinates he filed out of the court.
Then the police, headed by Chief Lees,
Captains Gillen and Wittman and Ser
geants Martin, Helms and Perrin.
swooped down on the whirlpool oi hu
manity in the betting ring and put a sud
den stop to the practice of hand-booking.
When Chief Lees arrived at the gates of
the track with the news that the restrain
ing order issued earlier in the day had
been modified, the policemen \#ere given
orders to fall In. Two abreast they
marched to the gates. The gate keepers,
who had become exceedingly bold by the
temporary triumph of their employer,
Corrigan, refused to allow the police to
enter. . . . _
-"Go in there, boys," shouted Chief Lees
angrily. .And in they went, almost carry
ing with them the big gate, gate keepers
and all. They marched . into the betting
ring and took up -the same positions they
occupied during the fore part of the week.
The bookies, who were doing a brisk
business on the hand-booking scale. Im
mediately sought cover. Chief Lees had
posted himself on their names and iden
tity, and he set his men to watch all
whom he suspected of violating the law.
For the rest of the day the gamblers had
a subdued air, and the dismal spirit of
the day before i once more pervaded the
betting ring. In consequence, no arrests
had to be made.
The special card prepared for St. Pat
rick's day. by the Ingleside Coursing Park
Association went glimmering 7 gown to
dust. The activity of the police in ar
resting the poolsellers at the racing park
close by . was an example to the proprie
tors of the dog. park, and all bets were
declared off. Deserted grand stands, a
desolate betting ring and empty kennels
told of no racing, for the Ingleside cours
ing men did not care to tempt the strong
arm of the law. The dogs were not even
brought out. When Chief Lees and Cap
tain Wittman arrived they found nothing
to stop, and proceeded at once to the
Ingleside track.

rested at the track on Thursday were

Prosecuting Attorney Low promptly ; said:
"I consent." The Judge granted the mo
tion and just then Long asked if the
complaints had been sworn to. Warrant
Clerk Lyons happened -to be ln court and
he replied â¢in the negative. ell, I
move for a dismissal," said Long, on
the ground that there are no complaints
filed." The Judge quietly said that he
had already disposed of one motion and
he could not entertain another, while
Prosecuting Attorney Low audibly re
marked, "That's one on you, James.
About, an hour later . Attorney Ach,
Prosecuting Attorney Low and Prosecut
ing Attorney Joachimsen. of Judge
Mogan's court had a conference, Ach
suggesting that as he intended entering a
demurrer to the complaints it could be
argued before Judges Conlan and Mogan
sitting ln bank, which would dispose of
the question at once. If this suggestion
were adopted the cases could be all con
tinued to-day till Monday morning, when
the argument would take- place. They
waited upon Judge Mogan. as Judge Con
lan had left the hall, and said that the
suggestion was looked upon - with favor.
The Judge said he would consult Judge
Conlan this morning and see what action
would be decided upon before the cases
were called. ââ¢ ' ,
Last evening Chief Lees was served
with notice that a motion on behalf of
the Jockey Club would be made before
Judge Murasky this morning to set aside
the modification of the injunction on the
ground that ; it was Improperly made
and is erroneous. Henry Ach will repre
sent the Jockey Club, while Mr. McEn
erney and District Attorney. Murphy rep
resent the police. Undoubtedly a bitter
fight will be waged to vacate the modi -
fication, which practically grants to the
police the same authority as before the
thought of injunction entered the minds
of the racing people, but as law and right
are on the side of the modification it is
almost sure to withstand the assault ot
its banded opponents. <

Policemen Reilly and Hayden noticed a

His answers were not satisfactory and
when the officers searched him they found
a "jimmy" in his pocket. He was booked
evidenced by the hearty applause which
followed its conclusion. Its two opening
and closing verses are herewith given:
She sits all day beside the salty waters.
Fond Erin's eyes are dim:
She is thinking of her exiled sons and daughters
Beyond the wide sea rim.
She is speaking to the soft wind of her sorrow,
Low Is her voice and clear: â¢'â  â 
She mourns past days and bides a bitter mor
row-
Hearken and ye shall hear.
We are crying out thy story from the steeples,
Dear mother, over sea!
Wherever deed is done for helot peoples
That deed is done for thee.
For East and West the bondman ie related
By stronger ties than name;
The cause of freedom, wheresoe er debated,
Is single and the same.
Frank T. Shea stirred the depths of
Irish and American patriotism by his elo
quent oration, and the applause was fre
quent and intense. He began as follows:
Ladles and Gentlemen: That the love of

people, and that it will continue to survive
"Till the shamrock will not grow,
Till the rivers "cease to flow,
Till the love of liberty is fled. â
Till man is numbered with the dead.

Irish and their descendants, with constancy
and fidelity, and with undiminished enthusiasm
continue to honor this festive day. set apart
by custom for the universal reunion of the

quarter of the globe, unite.
Their gaze is fixed in one direction.
In thought they review the scenes of his-
They hold animated converse with the shades
of the departed, and catch through this com
munion firmer hope and courage for the future.
In no land under the sun do the sentiments
which on this day animate the breasts of the
children of Erin find a more responsive echo
than in this republic.
Here, unlike' in other lands, with our free
Institutions,, we (fan rejoice amid pleasant sur
roundings and sympathetic influences, for the
same love : of freedom and justice and earnest
solicitude that possess the hearts of the Celts
for the land of their fathers are but a reflec
tion of. those which warm the breasts of every
true American. '-_"-'â 
After reviewing, the many interesting
mutations of Ireland's history, to the time
of the eleventh century he continue^:
She was the only country in Europe, that had
maintained her national existence , and pre
served in original purity- her ancient and native
language. Ireland's past history may. well be
styled one of "spirituality. Intellectuality and
chivalry." a priceless heritage to transmit to

For th*se splendid triumphs the Irish race
will never forget the debt they owe this great
republic, which has been to them as a prom
ised land of freedom, for ' the part it took in
molding public opinion, and affording the moral
and material aid most potent in sustaining the
Irish people in their home rule movement.
In this hospitable land the sons of Ireland
have multiplied and prospered, carrying the
love of freedom and the faith of their fathers
from sea to sea. '','â 'â 
His concluding words were a fitting trib
ute to the valor of the sons of Erin dis
played In behalf of their adopted, coun
try. They were as follows:
They have shown their gratitude and marked
fidelity to the Institutions of this country, and
on every occasion and when the sound of war
rolled over the land they have responded.
Senator Randall said that "in times of war.
unfortunately for the Irish but fortunately for
American arms, they have almost always been
placed, where David placed Uriah, in the front
of the battle." _._._____.
They were in front to the number of one
half the colonial forces when Washington
moved ln triumph from Boston Heights to val
ley Forge and on to Yorktown.
They were in the front with Stewart on the
high seas and with Jackson behind the barri
cades of New. Orleans in 1812.
. They were ln the front that silent night when
the Maine went down in the waters of Havana,
beneath the sullen battlements of MOTTO Castle.
They were in the front with Sampson, with
Schley, with Hobson on the Merrimac. with
Shafter before the fated city of . Santiago. lt , nn
They were in the front in the first expedition
sent by the American Government to do ser
vice in foreign parts, and to-day in the far
far West, under the melting sun, amid the
pestilential jungles of the Philippines they
stand in the front with Dewey, that peerless
champion of the seas.
And are they not in the front
â¢'Of the brave, who rest *!_-*â¢â â¢
By all their country's wishes blessed.
An unannounced number of an exceed
ingly pleasing cnaracter was interspersed
n the programme at this point. Peter J.
McCormack, on behalf of the Irish-Ameri
can societies of San Francisco, presented
to President Barrett a handsome, gold
