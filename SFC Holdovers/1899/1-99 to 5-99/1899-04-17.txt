turning with his expedi
to Manila, by order of Gen-
I >tis, after evacuating the
town? of Pacte, Longos, Lum
han, Pa Gasajan and Santa

been driven.
enerai Lawton's troops arc
led in the movement north of
ila, and Laguna de Bai will
be left to the insurgents until the
rainy seas* ::. when the water!
will be higher, thus enabling the i
army gunboats to get into the
rivers. The launches captured
from the insurgents are to be re
turned to their former owners in
Manila. General Lawton said in
an interview:
"With the forces I have
there is no doubt I could go
through the whole island,
but if a government is to be
established it will be neces
sary to garrison all the
towns. It would take 100,
--000 men to pacify the isl- 1
ands. I regret the neces
sity of abandoning the cap
tured territory."
During the absence of Gen
eral Lawton's expedition to the !
Santa Cruz district, upon the
southeastern side of Laguna de |
Bai, the insurgents have been
concentrating at the northern
end of the lake, near Pasig, and
the American scouts report that
several thousand are already I
there.
Two hundred and fifty Chi- i
nese from Sai.ta Cruz have ar
rived here. They left town owing i
to their fear that the enemy, on
re-entering it, would wreak ven
geance upon them for favoring â

SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1899.
I broad^aPt thrnuÃhnut thÂ» tf-rTitnry
traversed by thp American trr>ops rop
irs of the prorlamation issiifrl by th^
Thilippino rommipsion to thp Filipinos
several weeks ago. Considerable dif
ficulty has been experirn^od by the
commission in arquatnling tho natives
with the kindly intentions of this Gnv
f rnment. Apuinaldo's orders require
that all proclamations posted outside
of the territory directly under the con
trol of the American forces shall be
torn down and destroyed, his object be
inp to prevent his people by every
means in his power from learning of
the friendly purposes of Fresid.-nt Mo-
Kinley. Tt was deemed a pood move
by th<> commission, ) n view of the pres
ence of Agnlnaldo in the north, to send
an expedition to the south which would
distribute copies of the proclamation at
all points touched, and at the same
time show the natives that friendly and
humane spirit animated the Americans,
though they were under the necessity
of destroying any armed resistance
they might encounter.
When I showed the Herald's dispatch
announcing the recall of General Law
ton to Brigadier General Schwan. act
ing adjutant general, he told me it was
in accordance with the understanding
of the War Department as to the pur
pose of General Lawton's campaign.
"General Otis sent this expedition to
Southern Luzon," he continued, "for
the purpose of destroying any Insur
gent forces that might be found there,
to make a careful reconnoissance of
the territory and to spread broadcast
the recent proclamation of the Philip
pine Commission, setting forth the pur
poses of this Government with respect
to the islands. You have doubtless no
ticed that General Lawton carefully re
frained from burning any of the vil
lages captured by him or committing
any damage other than was absolutely
necessary to the success or his opera
tions. Before his departure from Man
ila he was given careful instructions as
to the line of conduct he should pur
fuc, and he has evidently carried them
out In a very satisfactory manner. I
understand that he will release all the
prisoners he has taken and they will be
sent to their homes. By this action It
is hoped that he will prove to the Fili
pinos that the Americans are not as
barbarous as the insurgents pretend we
are, and that we propose to treat the
Filipinos humanely."
"Why is General Lawton needed at
Manila, general?" I asked.

HIS HOLINESS IS
OVERCOME BY WEAKNESS
LONDON, April 17.- The Rome cor
respondent of the Daily News thus de-
Bcrlbes the Pope's appearance: "The
golden chair fame into view as if
floating toward the altar, with *he
Pope .sitting like a pale shadow, like
a ghcrst. Many whispered, when his
face, overshadnwr-d by the glittering
triple crown, became (li.=<"rnible. His
dark eyes peered from their deep sock
ets, his hands trembled visibly and a
sad smile played on his colorless lips.
Holbein might hay.- painted him as the
pensonification of the vanity of human
splendor. "With his left hand he waved
sad greetings, while with his right he
did his feeble best to mark the act of
blessing."
The correspondent thus depicts what
will not Improbably prove the Pontiff's
last exit from a great celebration in the
cathedral :
"His Holiness was lifted to his chair
and raised on high. Then he put OYI
his glasses and from a missal which
<\irrlinal Steinhuher held, while Car
dinal M.'ifht stood with a lighted taper,
ho read the greater benediction. His
voice, that was onrp so firm and clear,
was scarcely audible, but in absolute
silence the first words, "Adjutorium
1 nostrum in nomine domini," were
caught by the assembled multitude.
He tried to raise himself, but fell back
a.nd pronounced the remainder of the
, benediction in a recumbent position. A
loud cry. like the bursting of a storm,
broke from the multitude, and the
Pope, stretching forth his hand in bene
â  diction, was carried out of St. Peter's."
The Rome correspondent of the Daily
T- I- graph, who found the contrast be
tween the glittering ceremony and the
debilitated figure of the Pope "more
painful than moving, " says: "The
wh<">le ceremony was unduly hurried.
j The Pope remarked to an attendant
afterward: 'Ah, how weak T feel. I
wonder if this will go down in history
as my last appearance at St. Peterls?' "

RIOTOUS SOLDIERS
SET FIRE TO A SALOON
After Bombarding the Place With Stones
the Infuriated Mob Apply a Lighted
Match to It.
BATTLE BETWEEN POLICE AND RIOTING SOLDIERS.
ANXIOUS to be revenged for an
alleged brutal assault on one of
their comrades a number of vol
unteers stationed at the Presidio
last evening wrecked Adolph
Rehfeld's saloon, at Greenwich and
Lyon streets and then set fire to it.
A barber shop conducted by Rehfeld's
brother, adjoining, . and a tailoring
establishment conducted by M. R.
Goldberg, were also destroyed by the
flames. The greatest excitement pre
vailed and for a time a riot seemed im
minent.
With curses for Rehfeld, the saloon
keeper, whom the volunteers accuse of
being responsible to a certain extent
for the beating their comrade had re
ceived, they gathered about the burn
ing structure and defied the few police
men who were attracted to the scene
to dislodge them.
Sergeant of Police Anderson, realizing
his helplessness in dispersing the mob,
hurriedly repaired to the Presidio,
where he informed Lieutenant Harris,
post adjutant, of the trouble. The lieu
tenant immediately summoned a de
tachment of his men and ordered them
to go to the scene. By this time Reh
feld's saloon was enveloped in flames
and a serious fire seemed imminent.
The mob stood on the opposite side of
the street and watched the flames with
apparent satisfaction. Acting under in
structions the officer in charge of the
detachment dispersed the crowd, after
placing a number of the most vicious
of the gang under arrest.
An alarm had been sent in from the
fire box a short distance away, and af
ter the Fire Department had arrived
little difficulty was experienced in
extinguishing the flames. Police Offi
cer John McLaughlin, while trying to
disperse the riotous gang, was struck
In the side with a bottle. He was tem
porarily disabled, and ; was carried to
"a house across the street, where he
soon recovered.
The trouble was . precipitated by
the assault upon Charles L. King, a
recruit, which occurred on Saturday
night in Rehfeld's saloon. King and
a comrade had entered the place and
called for drinks. There were three
strangers in the saloon at the time,
one of whom took offense at some in
sulting remark made by King. Words
led to blows, and King was badly
worsted in the encounter. He claims
that after he had been knocked down
his assailant repeatedly kicked him in
the face and head. The injured man
was taken to the post hospital, where
his wounds, which consisted of a deep
cut in the head and numerous bruises
jiiiou^-jja.e- ace, gad ueek, jy.erft .dressed.;
Yesterday morning King informed his
comrades that .he had been assaulted
without provocation, and intimated
that the saloon-keeper had assisted in
the attack.
In some mysterious manner a rumor
got out that King had died from
the injuries he received. After dis
cussing his supposed death his com
rades, convinced that the Baloon-keeper
was in a measure responsible, deter
mined to wreak vengeance on him.
Rehfeld'B saloon was about a block
away from the Presidio, and the riotous
gang, in order to be revenged, collected
a pile of cobblestones and proceeded to
stone the place. One of the missiles
penetrated the thin boards of which the
saloon was built and narrowly missed
Rehfeld. He immediately emerged from
the place and was received with a vol
ley of stones hurled by the infuriated
soldiers.
Seeing Police Officer McLaughlin walk
ing along Baker street, Rehfeld quickly
summoned him. By this time the mob
ha^ used up its sunnly of stones and
rushed in the direction of the saloon.
McLaughlin, satisfied that the men
were bent on mischief, took out his re
volver, c' ?rmined to protect the sa
loon-keeper at the risk of his own life.
As he stood in the doorway with his
revolver tightly clutched in his hand
the mob for a minute was nonplussed.
The supposed ringleader, accompanied
by several of the rioters while the of
ficer was engaged in an abortive at
tempt to protect the property of the
saloon-keeper, sneaked around to the
rear and forced an entrance. They
completely wrecked the bar and fix
tures and dumped the liquors on the
floor, me of the soldiers, unknown to
the police officer, started a fire in the
rear of the saloon. Policeman Phil
Herrin. who was also attracted to the
scene by the yells of the angry crowd,
discovered the blaze, and seizing a can
of milk poured the contents over the
flames, extinguishing the fire.
â¢ Realizing MeLaughlin's danger, Her
rin, with drawn revolver, joined him in
the front of the saloon and ordered the I
gang of rioters to disperse. Just then !
one of the mob threw a bottle, !
which struck McLaughlin, knocking \
him down. Herrin was assailed with !
stones, but beyond a slight bruise of j
the hand he escaped uninjured. While I
he was exhorting the angry soldiers to j
return to the Presidio several of the j
crowd, whose names have not been as
certained by the post commander, en
tered the saloon from the rear and
started a second fire. In a few min
utes the place was ablaze and an alarm
was jturncd in fxo.nj bos 245, at JLom

hnrd and Baker streets. Despite tho
efforts of several citizens and police
men to extinguish the fire the flames
communicated to the barber shop ad
joining and in a short time reached tha
tailor shop.
Realizing his inability to co-pc with
the maddened crowd Sergeant Anderson
telephoned to Captain Wittman at the
Central Police Station for reinforce
ments. Wittman at once sent all his
available men to the scene, with in
structions to suppress the rioters at all
hazards.
Immediately after telephoning for as
sistance Sergeant Anderson rushed to
the Presidio and informed Lieutenant
Harris of the trouble. The latter's men
hurried to the scene and formed a circle
around the rioters. They were then
marched to the Presidio and each one
closely questioned. They denied any
participation in the firing of th build
ing?, and persistently refused to give
the names of the men who had created
the trouble. Determining to ascertain
the identity of the soldiers who created
the trouble, Lieutenant Harris ordered
nearly 200 of them locked up in the
guardhouse pending further investiga
tion.
The report that a riot was in progress
attracted a large number of citizens,
who visited the scene but were driven
off by the police. After considerable
trouble the fire department succeeded
in extinguishing the flames, not, how
ever, until the three buildings were al
most destroyed. The saloon looked as
though it had been struck by a cyclone.
BroV._n bottles were strewn about the
floor, and a picture which Rehfeld
prized highly was torn from Its fasten
ings and stepped on by the infuriated
men. Sergeant Anderson, while at
tempting to induce the soldiers to leave
the scene, was truck on the head by a
Btone tt own by one of the gang.
His version of the affair is as follows:
"I was standing at the corner of
Greenwich and Baker when I saw Reh
feld quickly emerge from the saloon
and run down the street. He informed
Ime that a gang of soldiers was am
! bushed behind the fence of the Presidio
! and was storming his saloon with
j stones. I ran to the place and was
I about to enter, when I was struck on
the head by one of the missiles. I
could see the rioters behind the fence,
I near the er. . ... â  to the Presidio. After
j exhausting their supply of stones the
gang, which consisted of about fifty sol
diers, rushed toward the saloon, evi
dently determined on wrecking it.

who were present I was up against It
I telephoned to Captain Wittman for2

young lady said she war only Slightly bruised and would go home. J.

reinforcements. I then went to the
Presidio and informed Lieutenant Har
ris of what was going on. During my
absence the turbulent crowd had taken
possession of the saloon and started to
wreck it. There were a number of
shots fired by the gang, but fortunately
no one was struck by the bullets. After
the men who had boon sent by Lieu
tenant Harris to round up the gang ar
rived the mob quickly obeyed the order
to return to their barracks.
"There is no doubt but what the re
port that King had died was the cause
of the trouble. King, who is a raw re
cruit, is well liked by his fellow-sol
diers As I have been informed, he
went to the saloon on Saturday night
and engaged in a dispute which ended
in blows. He was severely punished,
and was compelled to go to the post
hospital for medical treatment. The
news that he had been roughly treated
spread rapidly, and, while his com
rades sympathized with him, I do not
think they would have wreaked ven
geance on the saloon-keeper if some
mischief-maker had not circulated the
report that King had died from the
effects of the beating he received. Sev
eral of the most vicious of the gang,
after stoning the saloon, drew their re
volvers and fired at it. Altogether,
about twenty shots were fired by
them."
Lieutenant Harris was sorely dis
tressed over the occurrence.
"If 1 had known it sooner," he re
marked, "I would have prevented the
destruction of the saloon and the
other buildings. I was informed by
Sergeant of Police Anderson of what
was going on, and lost no time in send-
Ing a detachment to the scene. I in
tend to make a thorough investiga
tion, and shall see that the guilty ones
are severely punished. I presume the
rumor of King's death incited the men
to riot. I have taken the name of
every soldier who was in the vicinity
at the time of the trouble, and to-mor
row will start a rigid investigation."
Adolph L. Rehfeld, the proprietor of
the burned saloon and restaurant, gives
the folio .ring version of the trouble
that resulted in the destruction of his
property:
"Last night there was a big crowd of
soldiers in my place, and two of them
started to talk about Cuba. After a
while another soldier came in and
joined in the discussion, claiming he
also had boon in Cuba. The other two
asked him what regiment he belonged
to and who were his officers. He got
tangled up and they told him he. was a
liar; that he had never been in Cuba.
They started to fight and the third man j
drew a razor. The â â " then jumped !
onto him and threw him out. I was in
the roar of the place when the row be
gan, but when I hoard the racket I
came into the saloon, just as the man j
who had been thrown out came back
through a side door. I helped tw-o of
his frio~ds put him out the second time.
"Shortly after a soldier from the
Ninth, who had been left in the hospi
tal, came in and wanted to sell me a
watch. Everything was peaceable at
the time and I took the soldier into the
roar room. We had been in these but
a short time when I heard a racket in
the saloon. The soldier said they were
fighting. We rushed back into the bar
room and I saw a man on the floor and
the whole crowd jumping on him. I !
got him on his feet, and, dragging him
to the door, pushed him out, at the '
came time telling him to run. Then I !
closed the door and held the crowd
back as long as I could, but in a min
ute or two they pushed me aside and
i. -in out. I could not see which way
they went, as it was dark. About half
an hour after two soldiers came to the
door and said, 'For God's sake give us
some whisky; there is a man dying out
here/ I saturated a handkerchief with
whisky, but it had no effect, and then
1 gave them a glass of whisky for the
man to drink.
"In about five or ten minutes the door'
opened and they were bringing in a sol
dier with blood all over his face. They
said the man was dead. I would not
allow thei to leave him in the place,
and told them he was just as well off
out doors as he would bo on the floor
of 'he saloon. They took him away to
the Teneral hospital. Then the police
came and wanted to know if I had had
any trouble. I told them that I had,
but that I did not think it amounted to
anything. while we were talking five
or six very young soldiers armed with
rickets taken from the Presidio fence
came in and said they were looking for
the men who had hurt their friend.
Their appearance made everybody
laugh, even the policemen.
"This morning early I was warned by
some soldiers that tho friends of the
man who was hurt were going to kill
me and wreck my place. So this even
ing I was fearing: trouble, and my wife
happening to come up from the house
I told her to find a policeman. I wag
talking to the officer when a corporal
from the Fourth Cavalry, a friend of
mine, came in. and, railing me into the
back room, told me that he thought my
life was in danger. He said he had
heard they were going to kill me and
wieck the house' after retreat had
sounded: I made him tell the same
tiling to the policeman, and after he
left another policeman came in..
"I was talking about the threats to
the policeman when we saw a big
crowd of soldiers coming down from the
Presidio. There must have been two
or three hundred of them, and as soon ,
as they were near enough they began
throwing rocks and brickbats at the
building and also fired several shots.
One of the policemen told m 2 to put
out the lights and skip out the back
way while the other officer went for
help. I got out as quick as I could, th !
policeman standing in front of the
building to keep the crowd back. After
I got away from the place I ran to the
Union-street car and started for the
North End Police Station. When the
car reached Van Ness avenue hill I
looked back and saw a blaze. I knew
at once that it was my place burning."
Rehfeld's statement is corroborated j
by H. A. Wells, a- cook in his employ.
He estimated his loss at $2500. The
damage to the other buildings which
were destroyed by fire amounts to
about $1500, partially covered by insur
ance.

in reinforcing the line about the city
of Manila. It is possible that when the
lake rises, as the Herald's dispatch in
dicate â :, General <Â»tis will resume the
campaign in the southern part of the
island."
An official of the State Department
with whom I talked told me the com
mission would continue its effort to get
the natives acquainted with the inten
tions of tho United States. This will
be done by moans of gunboats sent out
for the purpose by Admiral Dewey and
by expeditionary forces such as that
neral Lawton.
"I am confident," he continued, "as
sOon as the natives fully understand
i that this Government proposes to treat
' them liberally they will renounce their
allegiance to Aguinaldo and turn to the
j United States. Since the issuance of
the proclamation the members of the
nisslon have talked with many
Filipinos who have expressed them
selves as highly gratified at the liberal
i treatment promised them, and Presi
â¢ dent S( hurman has reported to the
I State Department that the effect of the
i instrument has been splendid. The
, commission has not yet got into com
; munication with any of the leaders of
the insurgents, but it is hoped that this
will shortly be effected, and then I
have no doubt you will witness a
prompt reduction of Aguinaldo's forces.
' It is appreciated by the President that
ian attempt to pacify the island by
means of the military and naval forces
i alone would perhaps require several
years, but reinforced by the diplomatic
work of the commission it is believed
that the rebellion will be brought to
!an end within a comparatively short
jtime. As Luzon Is the seat of rebel-
I lion the commission will remain on that
island until peace and order are re
stored, when they will visit other
i islands. I understand they will go
in company with influential natives
throughout the archipelago, who will
be employed to spread the news of the
friendly treatment which this Govern
ment propose* to accord to them."

SECOND TRIAL OF JAMES CUFF
RESULTS IN HIS ACQUITTAL
Alturas Young Man Found to Have Been Wrongly
Convicted of Attempt to Murder His Rival
in a Love Affair.
ALTITRAS, April 16.â After a legal battle extending over three years, and one which once resulted In a convic
tion, JamoÃ Cuff was last night accjultted of the charge that he attempted to murder his successful rival for a
woman's love. â¢
The case was one of the most sensational in the history of Modoc County. Miss Sarah Lush was in 1896 the
belle Of Alturats. There were many suitors for her hand, among them her cousin, James Cuff, a Modoc County stock
raisor, and August Miller of this city. Miller won the mountain beauty. Soon after Cuff had been rejected Miller
was suddenly taken ill, and it was discovered that he was the victim of arsenical poisoning. Circumstantial evi
dence pointed to Cuff as the pei i â  trator of the crime and he was arrested. The trial that- followed lasted thirty
days. The community was greatly excited over the outrage, and public sentiment had much to da with causinjr a
conviction. Cuff was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment. While the trial was in progress Miller married
the young lady, she having nursed him brick to health.
Since then there has been a crowing sentiment that a mistake was made and that the young man was'lnno
cent. The case was carried to the Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial on the ground that much evidence
that was immaterial was admitted.
The trial just concluded was even more sensational than the first. District Attorney E. C. Bonner and John
B. Raker conducted the prosecution, while Judge G. F. Harris and Judere W. W. Foster represented the defendant.
The trial lasted twenty-four days. Many stirring scenes were enacted in the courtroom. Frequently the attor
neys were on the verge of personal combat.
The jury was out but a short time. When It returned a verdict of acauittal the people in the courtroom could
not be restrained, but applauded and overwhelmed the jurors with congratulations. The court had Lo threaten to
clear the courtroom before order could he restored. Judge Harris broke down and cried like a child. He had
fought the case for three years, always believing in the innocence of the young man. When that innocence was
established he could stand the strain no longer.
The evidence addticed at this trial shows that James Cuff must have been an Innocent man â one more victim
of circumstantial evidence.

SACRAMENTO, April 16.â Masonic
Hall to-night gave evidence of the
handiwork and taste of expert deco
rators, and the Saturday night pr
nadcrs who filled the thoroughfares
paused in front of the building to ad
mire the combinations of black and
white, tho Templar colors, and their
accompaniment of tho national flag.
As the temple was to-night so will all
tho city bo this week. When the first
conclave of the Knights Templar ever
hold in California outside of San Fran
cisco will take place. The conclave will
open on Thursday morning and will
continue until Saturday night. Most of
the time will be devoted to- the secret
work of the order, but there will be
several public features which everybody
will be invited to enjoy. The most
notable of these probably will be the
parade of the commanderies on Thurs
day afternoon.
For the first time in the history of the
Grand Commandery of California there
will be in attendance on the conclave
a grand master of the Grand Encamp
ment of the United States. This high
office Will be represented in the person
of Reuben H. Lloyd of San Francisco.
There will also be present Grand Com
mander Robert M. Powers of San
Diego, who will be escorted hither by
the Ijos Angeles Drill Corps, a crack
organization. The weather at this sea
son of the year is pleasant and the
parade on the miles of level bitumen
streets should prove a feature alike
agreeable to its hundreds of partici
pants and the thousands of spectators.
The banquet of the conclave will take
place at Turner Hall on Thursday even
ing, and it is hardly necessary to say
that there will be a brilliant gathering
and a regal feast. E. C. Atkinson of
Sacramento Commandery has been
chosen toastmaster.
On Saturday evening, April 22, will
occur the exhibition drill, to be partici
pated In by the Ladies' Drill Corps,
California Commandery Drill Corps and
a drill corps each from San Francisco,
San Jose and Los Angeles. Thousands
of tickets have been procured for this
exhibition drill, and the massive Ex
position building, where the event will
take place, will no doubt present as
Ray a spectacle as on one of the closing
nights of tho State Fair.
Eminent Commander E. W. Hale of
Sacramento Commandory has been
warmly praised for the thoroughness
with which he has superintended tho
work of preparation for the conclave.
| In this he has been heartily seconded
! by the members of his commandery,
who are bound that the visitors shall
return to their homes with agreeable
recollections of the capital city's famed
I hospitality. To this end nothing has
been overlooked, and frequent meetings
of the local Knights attest the inter
est taken in the important event.
There are in the Department of Cali
fornia fifteen commanderies of the
Knights Templar. From ten of these
will come 200 delegates and it is ex
pected that at least 200 moro will come
from the other five cnmmanrlerles In
this department and from the com
manderies in the southern part of th<>
State. Amnng these will be the Los
Angeles Drill Corps.
Commander Hale has received from
C. A. Swlsler, captain general of El
Dorado County Cnmmandery, notifica
tion that ~FA Dorado Commandery will
be represented by thirty-five members
and a brass hand.

When Tichner managed to land the figh
after a game struggle on the part of the
big fellow attached to his line he offered
to sell it for a dollar, but when apprised
of the value of his prize he refused to
part with it at any price and took it to
San Francisco on the next train. Strip, d
bass are very rare, and this one is the
first known to have been caught in the
waters of the bay. A few were placed
In San Pablo Bay pome time ago and
this specimen ia probably one of them.

Special Dlsnatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, April 16.â The Saturday
on of the Universal Brotherhood
Congress being held on Point Loma was
called. to order by Chairman Harris.
After a rendition of classical music the
chairman called upon F. M. Pierce,
secretary general of the organization,
fur his annual report. He made an in
formal report, in which he brought to
the attention of the representatives
present a rough outline of the- matters
of importance coming within the circle
of his office during the past year. The
facts enumerated by him in his speech
were eloquent with. Hope and promise
Cor the speedy success and rapid de
velopment of the principles which the
congress is engaged in promulgating.
They showed that the organization had
made tremendous progress within the
year; that the number of lodges was
greatly in excess of the number a year
ago, .nnd that his office was receiving
a constant stream of applications for
membership. Mr. Pierces address was
received with enthusiasm, and was
greeted by round after round of ap
plause.
The chairman next called upon E. A.
Neresheimer, treasurer general of the
brotherhood, for his annual report. In
his capacity as treasurer general Mr.
Neresheimer made four reports, cover
ing, respectively, the finances of the
Universal Brotherhood, the Interna
tional Brotherhood League, the Theo
sophical Society in America and the
emergency fund. These reports showed
that the treasury had a balance on
hand and the receipts and disburse
ments had reached a much higher fig
ure than in any previous year.
The next report was by H. T. Pat
terson, superintendent of the Interna
tional Brotherhood League, which fur
nished a glowing description of the in
teresting work of the league during the
past year.
Chairman Harris introduced Mrs.
Elizabeth C. Mayer, superintendent of
the children's work through the world.
Mrs. Mayer gave a charming and
inspiring account of the work of her
department among the children in this
country, Europe and Australasia. She
gave an elaborate account of work
among the newsboys and bootblacks of
Toledo, 0., the children of the lotus
homes in New York and Buffalo and
the "Do-Oood" Mission of the East Side
of New York.
The next order of business was a re
port by F. M. Pierce, representative of
the School for the Revival of the Lost
Mvsterles of Antiquity, on the present
stains cf the school. Mr. Pierce made
a word picture of the scene stretching
out before his vision from the eminence
on Point Loma, on which he was stand
ing. Th> picture W" painted in living
color, and his application of it to the
purpose of the school was extremely
graphic. Mr. Pierce declared that the
temple to be erectefl on the point would
be an accomplished fact, when the light
and influence radiating and flowing
from its open portals would illumine
the night of ignorance and shed a hless
insr and a benediction on everything
within its reach.
The event of the session of yester
day's congress was an address by
KatheT 1 :e A. Tingley. in which she
gave the audience a clear, definite and
profound interpretation of the Greek
play "Eumenides," which is to be pre
sented to the members of the congress
and to the public generally on Monday
and Tuesday afternoons.
The leader then gave an extensive
and detailed account of the work which
she and her fellow crusaders had re
cently done in Santiago de Cuba. This
account was so vivid that the harrow
ing scenes and experiences through
which the crusaders had .recently
passed were made almost actual before
the .eyes of her hearers. She said the
destitution and suffering were pitiful,
and many of her audience shed tears
of sympathy. Immediately upon her
arrival there she commenced the hu
manitarian work of relieving the dis
trese and suffering, which labor of love
continued for a period of five weeks.
Mrs. Tingley declared that the most
distorted reports Rnd erroneous concep
tions in regard to the Cubans were
prevalent in the United States. She
says that they have some noble and
substantial qualities.
Another interesting fact in connec
tion with her trip to Cuba was the
planting of two liberty trees, one repre
senting Cuba and one the United
States. She referred to the grant of
thirteen acres of land by the Mayor of
Santiago to her for a site for an or
phanage. Mrs. Tingley announced that
she intended to erect the necessary
buildings as soon as she could com
mand the fime to attend to the matter.

MORGAN SAYS PARTITION
IS THE ONLY SOLUTION
NEW YORK, April 16.â The Washington corre
spondent of the Herald telegTaphs: Senator John T.
vi, leading mfmbpr of the Foreign Affairs Com
. ;tsked for an expression on the Samoan prob
:-aiil to-day:
"There is but one permanent solution of the Sa
moan question. That is the partition of the islands by

Just formed a commission to reconcile the differences
between themselves and the native Samoans. The
United States, Great Britain and Germany will, in my
Judgment, act most wisely if they immediately pro

good will result from a temporizing policy toward
these warlike and bloodthirsty savages.
"Whatever sentiment we may entertain for the
rights Â«f Saraoans, arbitrary law of a nature which
prevents an assimilation of the people will
ever be an insurmountable barrier to peace prog

is by the weaker class.
"The Samoan question, in view of the evident In
tentions of the United States, Great Britain and Ger

letter asserts, helped themselves freely
to the stores and whatever else they
could lay their hands on. The
grounds were searched, though In vain.
for Mataafa warriors. The letter fol
lows up this statement with a bitter
and sarcastic personal attack upon
("aptain Sturdee.
It proceeds then to enumerate the
reasons that led to the establishment
of the provisional government, which,
it is said, was to remain in existence
until an agreement with the signatory
powers regarding the future form of
the political conditions of Samoa had
brought about. The letter con
tinues:
"In thf> meanwhile the provisional
government, under the able leadership
of Mutaafa, had maintained such order
and security as under no former Gov
ernment. Everybody felt secure of his
life and property, the copra production
in the country commenced again and
there were signs of prosperous times
coming back to the white traders. No
body who represented material inter
ests wanted a change of the existing
conditions, the British Consul and his
aid, Captain Sturdee, of course, except
ed, who in order to give vent to their
dissatisfaction and to demonstrate the
alleged insecurity maintained â¢ strong
guard in the British Consulate and did
not give shore leave to the crews of
the warships, not to speak of other
ridiculous measures.
â¢< in March 6 the Philadelphia, under
Admiral Kautz, arrived here, when the
fate of the provisional government was
1. Admiral Kautz did not see fit to
try to get a just picture of the Samoan
situation by extending his inquiries as
far as possible. Chief Justice Cham
bers, who through his partial judgment
is responsible for the present trouble;
the English Con .ul, Maxse. and Cap
tain Sturdee were hi.' crown wit
nesses. The great many Germans well
informed on the conditions of the coun
try, and more particularly the German
Consul General, from the beginning
were not considered. The American
Consul did not deem it worth while to
give the matter a serious thought, and
complacently acquiesced in the propos
als of Maxse and Sturdee. On March
11 a conference of the three Consuls
with the Admiral took place on board
the Philadelphia, when the German
Consul protested with due energy
against the plan of the admiral to ex
pei and completely dissolve the provis
ional government, and use to this
end the whole force of the men-of-war.
In vain the German representative ex
plained to him that the country was In
a condition of perfect tranquillity and
that there was no reason why they
should not quietly wait for the decision
of the treaty powers.
"On March 12 Admiral Kautz Issued
his proclamation, and did not state in
the same the text that all Consuls were
ture cannot be changed, and it is better that they be
recognized at the outset of the work that is before the
Samoan commission and that the instructions to the
representatives of the three nations be given accord
ingly.
"In the pending diplomacy on this question the Uni
ted States with grace and fairness can take the ini
tiative, as she did several "years ago in the treaty ar
ranged with Malietoa. England and Germany then
lost no time in following our example and in securing
the same recognition accorded to us. The immediate
purpose of these three nations is to secure perma
nent coaling stations upon the island. Once estab
lished, however, these stations cannot be peaceably
maintained under the existing conditions of the na
tives. Until completely subiected to the control of
the whites, these savages will be a constant menace,
and bloodshed will follow.
"I am thoroughly impressed with the importance
of partition, as I believe that an immediate division
of the islands will bring about a speedy solution of
the trouble that may terminate gradually with the
practical extermination of the Samoan race. The
United States should have a coaling station at Pago
Pago. And then with the long desired cable in the Pa
cific reaching to Honolulu and Sydney, giving com
munication with the home Governments, there will be
little to interfere with the spread of civilization on the
Samoan Islands."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1899.
agreed as to the proceeding against the
provisional government.
"Tho (It'rman representative, firmly
resolved not to have the German war
ship Falkc participate in the impending
butchery, issued his counter proclama
tion. The Mataafa men were not al
lowed the least time for consideration.
They evacuated Mulinuu. the seat of
the provisional government, on Mon
day, March 3, but were already fired
upon when they, on Wednesday, had
not yet left the territory of the mu
nicipality. In order to frighten the Ma
taafa men still more, all the Tanu men,
though very little Inclined to fight
against thi-ir own people, were armed
by the Knglish with rifles and pk-ntv
of ammunition.
"Among the victims of the present
fighting- are also five brave marines,
and it is a pity to s that, if not all.
yet most of them have lost their lives
through the dullness of their own com
rades. That such things may happen
is only too easily explained. Officers
and crews, in consequence of the con
tinued guard and patrol service, are
over-exercised and nervous and lose the
rest necessary for the handling of flre-
arms. If a leaf rustled in the night, if
an animal moves, immediately the guns
and arms are fired; in short, there is an
incredible waste of ammunition.
"Of course, as was to be expected,
the anti-Ge. -an element In Samoa is
already now eagerly at work to make
the German Consul responsible for
everything, on the ground that he. by
refusing to participate In the proceed
ings of the Americans and English, en
couraged the Mutaafa men to resist
ance. This charge is easily refuted. A
procedure of such brutality as that at
present being enacted against Mataafa
is contrary to all laws of humanity and
civilization, and ought to have been
rejected at the start by the unanimous
vote of all the Consuls.
"How the tragedy of Mataafa and his
follower . will end is not difficult to pre
dict. If the Governments of England
and America do not put in time a stop
to the action of their representatives
here they will have on their hands the
blood of a good-hearted people driven
to death and destruction in maintain
ing its ancient laws and customs."
GERMANY'S SAMOAN
FORCE TO BE INCREASED
BERLIN, April 16.â The protected
cruiser Cormoran, according to reliable
information obtained by the Associated
Press, is just now the only German
vessel on her way to strengthen the
German force at Apia, Samoan Islands.
The gunboat Moewe has arrived at
Matupl, New Britain, off the coast of
Kaiser Wilhelmsland, the German pro
tectorate In Southeast Papua, from
which point she may be ordered to
Apia speedily if the situation should
demand.
Both the Cormoran and the Moewe
are much smaller than the cruiser Her
tha, which is now on the way to Asian
waters, where on her arrival the total
German squadror will have a displace
ment of 40,000 tons and an equipment of
3400 men.
The protected cruiser Geier. 1776 tons

CHINESE ARE SCAVENGERS
OF THE FILIPINO WAR
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
MANILA, March 19.â War has be
come bo commonplace an experience to
I Manila that the average citizen no
! longer thinks of becoming excited over
it. Every night some point of the hori
zon is crimsoned by the reflection from
burning huts kindled by the soldiers to
deprive the insurgents of hiding places.
.t/very night's quiet is shaken by the
liring from the line encompassing the
city. Every morning brings its pitiful
little consignment of uncomplaining
wounded to the hospital.
Manila forms an American oasis in
the island of Luzon. Around the city
stretches a thin line fifteen miles long
of entrenched soldiers.
The Filipino goes into the field unen
cumbered with useless baggage. Fol
lowing the course of their retreat be
yond Guadaloupe Church went the sou
venir enthusiasts who hang about the
American army, but they found noth
ing more than a few tin conking uten
sils and empty cartridge shells, whose
pattern prove that the insurgents have
the very latest style of rifles. Trousers
or underwear, a shirt worn outside
them, a straw hat, cartridge belt and
| rifle, a section of bamboo stalk filled
! with rice, a handful of green peppers
tied in a handkerchief, sometimes san
dalsâthese form the equipment of a
Filipino soldier.
No finer country for defensive fight
ing and no more embarrassine for of
fensive operations than the land around
Paslg Lake could be Imagined.
The Chinese are the scavengers of the
war. Like vultures, they hover in the
wake of the army, docking down upon
the ashes of every hut and the ruins of
churches to dig out stuff that no white
man could possibly use. Being beyond
suspicion of any interest in the hostili
ties save gain, they are admitted to
the camps and employed as servants.
Some of them peddle water and cigar
ettes on the line. One more daring than
most crept about the trenches of the
Kansana under a hot lire- and did a
good trade. When competitors ap
peart d he hastened to point out to them
the spot where a soldier had been
wounded, seemingly impressing on
them the dangers of their position, for
they ran away.
The forces of destruction are concen
trated upon the churches. They are
all solid buildings, of stone, so the na
tives use them as forts. Some church
has served as the keystone of nearly
every Filipino defense, and the Ameri
can artillery is compelled to batter
them. Caloocan church is a picture of
the havoc of war. There General Mac-
Jfrthur has his headquarters. The roof,
a sky-blue fresco studded with eilt
stars, has jagged holes where shells
from Dewey's ships came through.
Within the chancel rail is the office of
the staff and the pulpits are used for
desks. The rail holds a string of sad
dles, a telephone hangs beside the
st;itue of a saint, while the telegraph
clicks incessantly in an alcove. Cots
and hammocks fill the body of the
church, where soldiers are sprawled out
smoking and reading when off duty.
A hospital occupies a chapel in a cor
ner. The soldiers do not lack rever
ence, but everything must bend before
their work.
General Otis has put a stop t^ the
plans of officers who wanted to brine
their wives and families to Manila. He
said: "This is not a picnic nor a G. A.
R. encamnment. This is war."

RALEIGH AND MANILA
HEROES GET OVATION
NEW YORK, April 16.â The celebra
tion attending the return of the United
States cruiser Raleigh from Manila,
which had to be postponed yesterday
owing to the warship's late arrival, oc
curred to-day. The Raleigh, accompa
nied by two small war vessels cap
tured from the Spaniards last summer
and a fleet of about twenty-five excur
sion steamers and tugboats, , paraded
from Tompkinsville to Grant's tomb,
and from there back to anchorage in
the North River off Thirty-fourth
street.
A. steady downpour of rain fell from
noon on. The air was raw and the offi
cers and men of the Raleigh stood upon
the decks three hours, drenched to the
skin and shivering: with cold. There were
very few people along the river front in
the lower part of the city, owing partly
to the fact that the entrances to the piers
are closed on Sundays. But great crowds
assembled in Riverside Park, overlook
ing the Hudson, and men, women and
children stood there for hours under um
brellas watching the vessels on their way
up the river and return. By far the
greatest gathering of people was in the
vicinity of Grant's tomb, which was the
turning point of the parade. A 'national
salute was fired there by the Raleigh and
also by. the captured Spanish prizes, and
the scene was rendered a memorable one
by the shrieking' of a hundred steam
whistles from excursion boats and lo
comotives and cheers from thousands of
people on shore and on vessels in the
river.
The Raleigh lay at anchor off Tomp
kinsville all the morning. About 10
o'clock several excursion steamers arriv
ed from the city, ran alongside of her
and cheered her time and again. Mrs.
Coghlan, the wife of the commander of
the cruiser, arrived a. Tompkinsville at
about 9:30 o'clock. She took a small boat
and went out to the Raleigh and welcom
ed her husband. Captain Coghlan was
apprised early of the intentions of the
reception committee to visit the Raleigh
and accompany her on the parade. He
had his crew give her hull a fresh coat
of paint, and all the officers prepared for
the occasion by putting on full dress.
Rain commenced to fall soon after 10
o'clock, and an hour later the decks were
flooded and every one- on the Raleigh was
seeking shelter. Boats of every descrip
tion continued to arrive from the city,
nnd each one ran ud as close to the
Raleigh as possible and cheered for her.
The two captured gunboats, the Alvarado
and Sandoval, arrived from the navy
yard early, both dressed gaily with flags
and bunting, and they created almost us
much enthusiasm as the Raleigh her
self.
About 11 o'clock the large steamer Glen
Island arrived, carrying the citizens' re
ception committee, headed by Mayor Van
Wyck, and also having on board a num
ber of invited guests. A delegation from
the committee, numbering not more than
a score, went aboard the Raleigh. All
hands on the cruiser were called to quar
ters, and Mayor Van Wyck and the other
eommitteemen were received with naVal
formality. Captain Coghlan stood at the
gangway and received the visitors and
escorted them immediately to his cabin.
The ceremony was very brief, consuming
not more than five minutes. The Mayor,
in a few words, welcomed the Raleigh to
New York, and extended the freedom of
the city to the officers and men. Captain
Coghlan replied briefly. There was no in
spection of the vessel; in fact, that would
have been almost impossible in the
drenching rain that was falling. The com
mittee returned to the Glen Island at
once, and as Mayor Van Wyck left the
side of the Raleigh he received a salute of
fifteen guns. The Raleigh was headed
down the stream at the time and when
she raised her anchor and swung around
slowly, the whistles on all the craft near
her shrieked a salute, and the people on

SACRAMENTO, April 16.â The heroic
spectacle of a woman 80 years old sur
rendering her life in the hope of pro
tecting the life of her infant grand
daughter was presented in this city
this evening Mrs. Christian Miller of
3008 F street had gone to the evening
service at church, leaving her one-year
old daughter in the care of Mrs. Cath
erine Woods, the grandmother, 80 years
of age. The child was seated in a
high chair near the table, upon which
burned a reading lamp. The aged
woman engaged herself in reading
while the child prattled away.
The little one was playful, and, seiz
ing the tablecloth, gave it a jerk. The
force was not great, but it was suffi
cient to dislodge the lamp. The next
instant the clothes of the baby were
ablaze. Terrified, and yet with some
presence of mind, the 80-year-old grand
mother righted the lamp and seized the
child in her arms. Out erf the house she
ran with the screaming infant, pressing
it to her bosom in an effort to smother
the flames that were consuming its
clothes and scorching its tender flesh.
Once in the garden Mrs. Woods rolled
the child in the grass, he-ping to put
out the fire, and succeeding measur
ably. Meantime the flames were en
compassing the little home; and mean
while also the fire which had caught
from the child's clothnig was bent upon
the destruction of her own life. Neigh
bors saw the old woman, her clothing
aflame, run toward the burning house.
Ten minutes afterward her blackened
body was found just outside the door
way. Every vestige of clothing had
been burned away. When Mrs. Miller
returned from church she found her
home sadly damaged by fire, her mother
dead and her child frightfully burned,
though still alive.
VIOLA HORLOCKER
BACK AT HASTINGS
Returns to Face Charge
of Poisoning.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HASTINGS. Neb., April 16.â Miss
the excursion steamers cheered and
waved handkerchiefs and flags. The Glen
Island led the- procession, the Raleigh fol
lowing just astern. The Alvarado and
Sandoval took positions off either bow of
the cruiser, and police boats. tugs and
excursion boats followed in a double col
umn. There was no special demonstra
tion until Governors Island whs passed,
when a national salute was fired. About
this point the coast survey steamer
Pathfinder, with Assistant Secretary of
the Navy Allen aboard, joined the pro
cession, following just in the wake of the
Raleigh.
From the time the Raleigh loft the Bat
tery until she reached Grant's tomb, her
whistle and fog siren were blowing al
most constantly in response to salutes
from vessels lying at their docks or mov
ing up and down the river. The ferry
boats were crowded with people cheering
and waving handkerchiefs, and several
of the boats ran alongside the Raleigh for
a short distance. Captain Coghlan was
on the bridge nearly all the way up thr>
river with the executive and navigating
officers. All were bundled up in rain
coats and received the force of the storm
in their faces. The captain was obliged
to bare his head to the rain a greater
part of the time in waving his cap in re
sponse to the salutes and cheers of pass
ing vessels.
The officers paid little attention to the
storm and waved their caps constantly,
not appearing to mind the soaking which
their dress uniforms, and their bodies as
well, received. As for the sailors, they
never thought of shelter at all. A few
were clad in oilskins, but most of them
stood on the exposed forecastle, with
nothing but their blue jackets covering
their shoulders, and most of the time with
their hats flying in the air. Officers and
men alike expressed the greatest surprise
at the demonstration. Many of them
were heard to make remarks' to the ef
fect that the battle of Manila hay was
fought so long ago that they had almost
forgotten it.
Viola Horlocker returned to Hastings
to-night in company with her mother
and friends and will face the charges
of having attempted to kill Mrs. C. F.
Morey by sending her a box of bon
bons containing arsenic. The accused,
in company with her attorneys, will
go before the County Court to-morrow,
when the Sheriff will place her under

While the rain had not abated in tho
hast when the Raloigh and her escorts
reached the southern end of Riverside
Park the enthusiasm, instead of falling
off. increased, both on the vessels and on
the shore. The boulevards and paths in
th<- park wore crowded by the people who
had been waiting an hour or more. Two
of her batteries fired a salute near this
point: the people along the shore in boats
and small launches tired off cannon crack
ers revolvers and guns, while half a
dozen locomotives on the tracks along the
river added to the deafening noise by
blowing their whistles all the time the
Raleigh was passing.
Just before arriving almost off Grant's
tomb the cruiser slowed down prepara
tory to turning, and while the cheering
and whistle-blowing and other noises
were at their height, two six-pounders on
the Raleigh commenced their salute of
twenty-one guns. The last shot had
hardly died away when the Alvarado and
Sandoval opened with their national sa
in to and a battery on shore joined in the
tribute to General Grant. When the sa
lutes wore concluded tho Raleigh turned
slowly and headed down the river, her es
corta turning at the same time. The run
back to anchorage off Thirty-fourth
street was made slowly and the same en
thusiasm waa displayed as on the run
up the river.
When the Raleigrh finally anchored she
was surrounded by a fleet of excursion
boats, and as fast as they could reach
her gangway the people aboard them
climbed on the cruiser and extended a
personal welcome to the officers and
men. The crew took groat pride in show
ing visitors over the ship and particular
ly in pointing out the five-inch gun
which fired the first shot in,, the battle
of Manila Bay. Many relatives and per
sonal friends of tho officers and men
went aboard as soon as they could reach
the side of the vessel, and the day's cele
bration concluded with these general and

EVERYTHING ROSY AGfllN.
AS was foresha 1 this column a week ago,
the break in the industrials during the first days
the month has resulted in a better market in
1 financial thunderstorms, like their
re excellent clearers of vitiated
here?. It was supposed that the reaction
would be in the railroad shares, but to the surprise of
the street the industrials themselves showed the most
rebound. They are again in favor, though speculation
i.- characterized by more conservatism, and the mar
- therefore on a better basi<.
The slump in the industrials did not affect general
the least. Even in the midst of the
storm, when Wall street was in an uproar and quota
\ ere dropping on all side?, the business of the
country, as shown by the bank clearings, was 59.7 per
cent better than for the same week in 1898, while this
the clearings soared up to 95.4 per cent, show
t the enormous expansion of American trade
ng merrily on. Pittsburg shows the greatest
se â 1 16.5 per cent â indicating that the iron and
:des are as lively as ever. The best report of
ck, however, is in wool. This staple is appar
ently awakening from its long sleep. Indeed, sales
;;re the heaviest for many years at this season, those
for the week being 6.792,000 pounds in the three mar
-35,000 pounds for the same week in
The woolen mills have begun to purchase
large sales have been made for re-export,
chiefly Australian grades on English account. The
New York dry goods market is reported quieter on
ot, though large fall orders are being received.
Boots and shoes arc firm and in good demand at
the advance made some time ago. The lumber mar
ket continues firm and active. The cotton industry is
I in satisfactory condition, the demand being
good. Railway earnings show no decrease, and, in
fact, wherever we look, tve find a greater expansion in
general business than has ever before been experi
enced in this country. The failures for the week were
gainst _'54 for the corresponding week in 1808.
The money market is decidedly easier, and this in the
face of about $50,000,000 paid into syndicates in four
payments. Evidently \\c are as flush of cash as ever.
The only stringency noticeable is in call loans.
There is only one adverse feature to the situation,
and that is the le>.~ favorable appearance of the wheat
hich turns out to have been considerably dam
aged by the February freeze, which killed so many
fruit trees, throughout the Eastern, Western and
Southern States. For some time rumors to this ef
fect have been persistent, but the sanguine American
temperament is prone to look askance at adverse re
-1 orts of anything, and it needed the confirmation of
the Government report to satisfy the doubting
Thomases of the wheat trade. Under this confirma
tory report of the Government the market hardened,
though the appreciation was slight and was followed
by a reaction.
The local wheat market, as far as actual grain on
the spot was concerned, did not respond to the East
ern advance, though futures improved. The outlook
for the crop in California is excellent, though some
sections will need a little more rain to properly fill
out the heads. With no more rain a fine hay crop is
ally assured.
It is yet too early to definitely estimate the coming
fruit crop of the State, but it will hardly be as enor
ls enthusiasts predicted a month ago. Peaches
promise the best at the moment, and they will be
needed, as the Eastern crop was destroyed by the
February freeze. More or less drop is reported in the
other kinds, owing to the strain on the trees last year
when the ground W as dry. All fruits blossomed
heavily this spring, but the fruit failed to set as freely
h^ expected. With the exception of apricots, how
ever, there will probably be enough fruit to go
around, though prices may be somewhat higher than
ral trade is still good, and no complaints are
â  : in any quarter. We are remarkably free from
res, and the merchants report collections fully up
le average at this time of the year. Leniency in
credits is marked, whereas at this time last year there
vns an equally pronounced tendency to keep them
pretty closely pared. But there is a good deal of dif
ference between the prospects now and at this time
last year.
The fact that a Corrigan horse won a Corrigan
derby should not occasion any surprise. One has
only to remember that Corriganâ but what's the use?
THE RESULT OF THE DINNERS.
WHAT was revealed by indirection and some
what indistinctly by the Jefferson banquets at
Milwaukee and at the .Metropolitan Opera
House in New York, has been made clear by the
"dollar dinner" at the Grand. Central Palace in the
latter city on Saturday evening. Colonel Bryan re
mains the leader of the Democratic party. There may
be plots against him among the Eastern bosses who
despair of carrying their States for free silver, but
the rank and file of Democracy is with him, and his
hold upon the discontented classes is apparently as
;trong to-day as it was in 1896.
The situation is not easy to understand. Bryanism
was defeated by an overwhelming majority at the
polls in 1896 and again in the Congressional elections
of 180 S. Under that banner Democracy has met
nothing but disaster, and is now weaker and more
demoralized than ever before in the history of the
country. Western States that were for free silver in
'96 gave Republican majorities last year, and even in
the South the tone of the more influential papers has
been adverse to a continuance of the Chicago policy.
Yet in the face of all these evidences of public re
pudiation, when the Democratic leaders of the West
and of the East meet to honor the memory of the
founder of their party, Bryan is the only man among
them who is anywhere greeted as a national leader.
It is probable Bryan's hold on the rank and file
of his party is due mainly to the courage with which
he stands by his convictions and his uncompromising
adherence to the Chicago platform. Force of char
acter, decision and resolution hardly ever fail to win
when combated only by weakness, doubt and hesita
tii n. The Democratic masses must have a leader and
a party cry. The conservative dignitaries furnish
neither. Bryan comes forward, takes the leader's
place and formulates a policy. Is it any wonder the
masses follow him, leaving the timid conservatives
chattering in the rear?
As a net result of the expressions of Democratic
sentiment at the banquets we may conclude that un
less the unexpected happens the campaign of next
year will be on the part of the Democrats an attempt
to array the West and the South against the East,
the poor against the rich, the discontented against the
prosperous and the lawless against the law. The de
mand for free silver is but a part of the cry that the
people are being crushed by the money power, that
liberty is being stifled by monopoly, and that pros
perity and wealth are synonymous with dishonesty
and corruption.
Such is the sum of the expressions of the ten
dollar banquet at the Metropolitan Opera House
as well as of the dollar dinner at the Grand
Central Palace. Colonel Bryan has captured New
York and reasserted his supremacy in his party.
When at the latter feast John Clark Ridpath
spoke of Thomas Jefferson as "the most in
tellectual Democrat that ever lived," a hundred voices
shouted, "No, no; Bryan. Bryan." There is a fanatic
real in the crusade of the silverites which must run
its course, and fortunately the stability of American
common-sense is sufficient to prevent it from being
any serious danger to the republic. It has been
beaten twice, and in 1000. like the fanatic dervishes at
Omdurman, will be wiped of? the earth.
THE SAMOON COMMISSION.
GERMANY has won what may be called the
first trick in the game of diplomacy to be played
out with the Samoan Islands as stakes. She de
manded that the commission representing the three
powers should have no authority to act unless unani
mous, and the demand has been conceded by the
United States and Great Britain.
As the British Government for some time opposed
the requirement for unanimity, the concession of the
point constitutes what is noted as the German victory,
and the political opponents of the Salisbury adminis
tration are making party capital out of it by denounc
ing the concession as a surrender of British interests.
The Germans, on the other hand, are well pleased
with the firmness of their Government, while we are
not much affected one way or the other.
It is fortunate the United States were in a position
and in a mood to act impartially on the issue. Ger
many certainly was fully justified in demanding unan
imity, for it is well known the Americans and the
British in the Samoan Islands have long since pooled
their interests and have for years been acting almost
as a unit. For the Germans to have entered into a
council of three and permitted a majority to rule on
all issues would under such circumstances have been
virtually giving up the game. It is very sure at the
start that Great Britain and America will vote on
the same side on almost every point that comes up,
and the Germans would be at a serious disadvantage
but for the unanimity rule.
There is, however, considerable force in the British
objection to the German plan. It may lead to the
defeat of the object for which the commission has
been appointed. Either power under the unanimity
rule can block the game, and the settlement of the
Samoan disturbances may be indefinitely postponed.
America's prompt consent to the Berlin proposi
tion, however, left Salisbury in a position it was
diplomatically impossible to maintain. Since the
United States and Germany, a majority of the parties
to the controversy, agreed upon the plan, he couid
not oppose them without opposing his own proposal
that the majority should rule. There was nothing to
do but to give in. and it is an evidence of good sense
on his part that he made the concession promptly.
Thus far everything has gone well enough with the
commission, but it remains to be seen on how many
points they can unanimously agree. This Samoan
business is one of the comic operas in which you
never know what is going to happen next
MILITARY CONCILIATION.
OUR invitations to the Filipinos and our treat
ment of them correspond as imperfectly as our
theories and our practices at home. Concilia
tion was the announced leaven of President McKin
ley's policy, and our method of conciliating them is by
sending them on the rifle route to the home of eternal
peace. Barbarities have been described in letters
from soldiers that ought to fill the American heart
with indignation. Accounts of massacres from au
thentic sources have depicted scenes that equal in
ferocity any incidents in Persian or Roman history,
in the Spanish invasion of the Netherlands or in the
Indian wars of the eighteenth and nineteenth cen
turies.
Except to the blatant expansionists the attempt to
treat the Filipinos as rebels or insurgents and their
native land as a purchase from Spain is revolting.
But wholesale murder and cruelty degrade us to the
level of savages. Tn The Call of Saturday a revelation
was made which, if not derived from a reliable source,
would have been incredible. A corporal, we regret
to say among the California Volunteers, having been
specially commended for his bravery, in the unre
strained freedom of a private letter writes from
Manila as follows:
"We sleep all day here, as we do duty all night
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1899.
walking the streets. We make every one get into his
house by 7p. m., and we only tell a man once. If he
refuses we shoot him. We killed over 300 men the
first night. They tried to set the town on fire. If
they fire a shot from a house we burn the house down
and every house near it and shoot the natives, so they
are pretty quiet in town now."
This is the matter-of-fact report of a young Ameri
can citizen, written in apparently stolid unconscious
ness that to kill a man for once refusing to retire to
his own house or to commit arson and homicide by
the wholesale as a punishment for individual acts is
in any way inconsistent with the principles of his
Government or the proprieties of American civiliza
tion. If an army were to be trained abroad to destroy
our liberties at home, no more effective system could
be adopted. The quietude of the grave is as com
plete in San Francisco as in the capital of the island
of Luzon.
Samson revenged himself upon the Philistines by
tying 300 foxes tail to tail, with firebrands between
them, and then turning them loose. If the 300 Fili
pinos had been tied back to back, with lighted tapers
between them and then driven through the streets of
Manila, the butchery would have been equally satis
factory, their sufferings more agonizing and the
destruction of property more ruinous. The Apaches
used to mutilate our citizens in Arizona and in New
Mexico. If we have adopted them as models we
ought to perfect our imitations, and, with our
superior intelligence, we could soon invent and em
ploy original forms of refined cruelty.
When the Civil War was raging, President Lincoln, j
under instructions from Congress, had Washington's !
farewell address read at every military post a"nd at j
the head of every regiment in the country. After the j
nightly carnival of blood and the manifestations of
American despotism which this young corporal de
scribes, the patriotic literature of his native land
would be hardly tolerated and much less appreciated, j
The Call hopes that the attention of the adminis
tration may be attracted by the^e reports from the
Philippines, which are becoming more and more
numerous, and that executive authority and drum
head courts-martial may relieve the situation that is
fast exceeding possible toleration and injuring the
United States in the estimation of Christendom.
SOME MASSACHUSETTS PRACTICES.
SOME time ago Chicago, stung to the quick by
the exposure of the embalmed beef business,
retorted that Boston is as bad as herself,
inasmuch as it has been the custom of the Bos
tonians to pack immature herring in dainty cans and
sell them under the enticing label, "brook trout."
It is now made known that Boston has another
pretty practice in the food business by means of
which some of her thrifty citizens hoped to reap a
rich reward, but didn't.
According to the story as told by the Boston Her
! aid the packers of codfish discovered some time ago
I that if instead of the old method of preserving the fish
i by dry salting they would resort to wet salting the
! process of curing would be quicker and cheaper, and,
i moreover, to each fish there would be added a con
siderable weight of water, which of course would be
sold at fish prices and add largely to the profits.
The Herald says the scientific method was first used
by the fish men of Gloucester and that the Boston
dealer's were compelled to adopt it by force of com
petition.
The results have not been wholly satisfactory- The
; wet salted codfish can be worked off upon consumers
in temperate climates, but it does not stand the test
of the tropics. Consequently when it was sent to the
Wcit Indies it palled upon the taste of the public.
They have refused to consume it, and the Herald
notes that "the dealers in those islands and in other
adjacent tropical countries do not care to purchase
codfish cured by the wet salt process, but prefer to
buy dry salted Canadian codfish even at a higher
price."
The pleasant practice of selling salt water for cod
fish having thus proven to be unprofitable, the Herald
condemns it, but we note that in the same issue of
the paper it speaks in some commendation of an en
terprising citizen who has been solving the sparrow
problem by a practice which threatens to ruin the
trade in reed birds.
Of that up-to-date gentleman, it is said he has felt
as much as any one the annoyance of the English^
sparrow, but has had no faith in the efficacy of the
methods generally used in New England to -get rid
of the nuisance. His experience taught him that the
sparrows can build nests faster than man can destroy
them. His method of procedure is to saturate food
with intoxicating liquor and to feed the birds with it
thus saturated. Then the sparrows become intoxi
cated and turn up their toes on the ground, where his
gardener picks them up and disposes of them to the
marketmen as reed birds, to be served on toast.
Such practices as selling green herring for brook
trout, salt water for codfish and whisky-soaked spar
rows for luscious reed birds are in the highest degree
reprehensible. Nevertheless, they do not justify
Chicago in defending the embalmed beef business.
Mrs. Broome and her hired man of Santa
Barbara gave battle to fourteen men. After a sharp
skirmish the lady was arrested. She says she is a
British subject and will carry the case into the na
tional courts. This seems particularly unkind when
Uncle Sam and Johnny Bull are shaking hands
of peace across the seas.
The scheme of establishing order in the Philippines
and then trading them to Great Britain for her islands
in the West Indies continues to engage attention in
the East, but the cost to us of such a trade seems to
be overlooked. It would be cheaper to turn the Fili
pinos loose and buy the West Indies for coin.
The announcement that Speaker Reed is about to
start for Europe should be hailed with delight by the
delegates to that other Czar's peace congress. If they
can only induce the man from Maine to stop off at
The Hague they may learn a few valuable pointers
on the gentle art of getting a quorum.
It is worth noting that, despite all the talk about a
new leader for the Democratic party, no person was
named for that office by the speakers at the Jeffer
son banquets except Bryan. The Gorman, Olney
and Miles booms were not taken out of the re
frigerators at any stage of the feast.
It is not unlikely that George Crocker has awak
ened to a vivid realization of the suggestion that he
who sups with the devil must have a very long spoon.
C. P. Huntington is a good entertainer, but w e have
his own assurance that he seldom pays for the feast.
Aguinaldo must be in desperate straits when he
finds- it necessary to kill off his rivals. The mere fact
that he has any is sufficient to show that his grip on
the Filipinos is loosening and that the end of native
opposition is near.
And now it is announced that a cousin of the Vice
reine of India is going on the stage. She thinks she
has discovered a demand for Leiter comedy.
MILLIONAIRES FIGHT OVER
THE BIRTH OF QUARTZ MINING
The first California quartz mine is in lit
igation in the United States Circuit Court
here, and the historical associations, the
novelty and importance of the legal issues
involved, the prominence of the parties
and the attendant circumstances that pro
vide variety make the case a notable one
and the story one of exceptional interest,
though public attention has not before
been drawn to it.
This mine is the Gold Hill mine, close to
Grass Valley, and the: company owning it
is defendant in the case of the Peabody
Gold Mining Company vs. the Gold Hill
Mining Company. The suit seeks to dis
possess the Gold Kill company of a large
part of its patented "round, and of veins
therein of which the defendant has had
undisputed possession .for over a genera
tion, on the ground that the patent is in
part illegal and null and void.
The Gold Hill mine is mainly owned by
E. AY. Hopkins, the president of that com
pany, and the adjoining Peabody mine is
controlled by Baron yon Schroeder, so
that the legal war is practically between
these two millionaires. The real motive
and reason of the suit is not in any inclin
ation on the part of Baron yon Schroeder
to "jump" some of a neighbor's ground,
as has nominally been done, but in a sus
picion on the part of the- Peabody people
that the deeper Gaul Hill workings are
getting into their subterranean territory,
aiid in a wish to protect their Interests
below as they think they see them. The
litigation, began last fall and thereupon
the Gold Hill people properly oi'" work
and allowed the mine to till to the top
with water so that no explorations could
figure in the case.
The initial phase of the rase, involving
an injunction against the defendant, was
recently argued and submitted by A. H.
FUcketta for the complainant ana by E.
W. McGraw for the respondent. The de
cision of Judge Morrow on the important
legal points presented will take an im
portant place in mining jurisprudence.
One treads dangerous ground in sur
veying the history of the beginning of
quartz mining in California. Much con
flict of authority can be quickly found.
Gold-bearing quartz was found before
fame rushed to Gold Mountain, as placer
gold was found before Marshall saw his
nugget, but it wan the Gold Mountain dis
covery that started the quartz mining ex
citement, and it is generally taken as the
beginning. The Gold Hill mine is cer
tainly the oldest one in California, and Its
reputation as the rirst one is justified.
This history of the very beginning
sticks out of the case at bar in a charm
ing way, yet in a disappointing way, lo
calise of its incompleteness, and the case
turns largely on this early history, as s.i
many suits Involving millions have turned
In the acts and rude methods of careless
prospectors lons before.
It is undtsputably shown that the dis
covery was made by Cracklin on Decem
ber 30, 1850. At that time miners were
working in placer diggings in the region
about what is now Grass Valley, close to
the present limits of which town Gold
Mountain stands. A party of miners were
cunning in this hill, and Cracklin was one
of them.
In his splendid report on "the gold-bear
ing quartz veins of the Grass Valley and
Nevada City mining districts," published
recently by' the. United Staws Geological
Survey, Waldemar Lindgren says that the
first find of gold-bearing quartz was made
In Gold Hill by a German in September,
1850. He sold the piece for $5, and it
yielded $KÂ«). Other fields of float attracted
little attention, but in Nrtvember, I>>.V>, a
rich shoot of ore was struck by miners
digging a hole for a cabin chimney. Greal
excitement followed, and locations were
made. He states that the rock was first
crushed In mortars with a strong pole,
and that the Huff Company ' nn k out
$20,000 that way that winter. The first
mill, a rude and nearly useless one, was
Eut up in January, 1851 and Boon after a
etter eight-stamp mill was erected and
crushed rock for $.ii) a ton. the miners
being paid $12 a day. This eminent g<
gist doubtless fell into error when he es
sayed history.
The affidavits of Thomas 'Tacklin and
others, filed in the suit, show that Craok
lin's discovery was made on December SO,
1850. The circumstances are not related.
Whatever rich float had been picked up
before, this was "the discovery." A local
excitement was on. probably within an
hour. Whether the ledge in place or its
broken top was found that day is not
shown. The rock, however, was v. ry rich.
Ed down thr> hill, partly disintegrated, and
made the ground below rich in gold, < spe
cially three or four feet below the surface.
The details of what was said and done
on the hill that day would make interest
ing reading and would doubtless he
worthy material for Bret Harte. It is
known, however, that before that day
ended the miners there exhibited their
characteristic energy, capacity for self
government and respect for justice and
order by meeting, organizing a mining
district and adopting laws for its govern
ment. These laws are of record in Ne
vada County and a certified copy is on ex
hibit in the ease that drags them forth.
Tnt-y are the laws of the rtrst quartz min
ing district In America and have never
been published in any permanent record.
They are brief, sensible and may \*> said
to be picturesque and they do not seem to
require Philadelphia lawyers. The fol
lowing are some of the sections:
"Gold Mountains laws, passed December
30, 1850.
"Article One. These diggings shall be
called Gold Mountain and certificates of
claims shall be headed accordingly.
"Second. Thirty by forty feet shall con
stitute a full claim.
"Fifth. All persons can hold one claim
by occupancy and any number by pur
chase.
"Sixth. When a claim has been proper
ly staked, numbered and recorded It can
be held without tools being left upon It
or any work being done until the first day
of April, 1851, without interruption by the
owner.
"Tenth. All difficulties and suits arising
out of claims, trespasses, etc., shall be
tried before the Recorder, with two other
miners, one to be chosen by each party.
An appeal, however, may be taken to the
Justice of the Peace.
'"Eleventh. Any person who takes
away or uses tools of another without
permission of the owner shall forfeit all
his rights upon the mountain. If he has
no Interests then he shall be made to pay
twice the original value.
"Twelfth. Any person who throws dirt
or rock upon the claim of another shall
be made to remove It or forfeit their right
of claims on the mountain."
These laws of the Gold Mountain dis
trict are worthy of a prominent place
among the hundreds of mining codes
voluntarily adopted by a people dom
inated by Anglo-Saxon nature and ideas
at a time when it was wholly a law
â¢unto Itself and a sufficient one. It was
the mass of such laws, so molded, that,
crystallized, became the first Federal
mining: law of IKOB and again the present
law of 1872 and a thing unique in the
world's legislative history.
It will be observed that these first laws
of a quartr mining district show no cog
nizance of "quartz" conditions, and this
fact becomes of great importance in the
suit at issue. Those miners who figured
In that historic "excitement" and "rush"
of December 30, 1850, knew nothing about
quartz veins. They proceeded as placer
miners and substantially enacted the reg
ulations which placer mining had pro
duced elsewhere and with which a few
weeks or months of experience had
made them familiar. There was no
thought of a "discovery of a lode," and
they might have thrown into the on-.-k
one who spoke the strange phrases "ex
tralateral rights" and "dips, spurs and
angles." Any man could strike out any
where in Gold Mountain but one claim
30 by 40 feet, and the ledge had no legal
recognition. Any claim, ledge or not
must be marked with a stake at each
corner and one in the center bearing ita
consecutive number, each stake driven
two feet into the ground. Claims were
recorded and transferred by number
?< nl> \ ,. T . he Â«S or( l' accord| n& to Thomas
Cracklin s affidavit, was a common nock
etbook. which was filed in a suit and
burned with other county records in
1556. Thomas Cracklin's claim was No 1
As in any placer claim the owner's rights
were confined by the vertically prniecn><!
boundaries of his claim and in this first
quartz mining district the idea of fnl
lowing a vein whither it might lead
within the end boundaries of the claim
had not been conceived Â«-'Â»im
To understand the merits of the suit one
very natural thing must bÂ« observed
among others The gold on the side hill
was all below the vein. Hence, when those
early rushers staked out their claims the
upper boundary of each upper claim was
practically the upper edge of the vein.
Every locater wanted every inch of rich
ground he could get, and the hill above
the vein went begging. So, along the vein
there was a row of 30 by 40 claims hang
ing to the upper wall and the ground
down hill was all taken up.
Mr. Cracklin'B affidavit naturally shows
that the surface ground was soon worked
out, and that it was later discovered that
costly â hafts, tunnels, hoisting works,
etc.. were needed to work the ledfjr it
self. As l>y a law of nature the early
buying up and consolidation of these
40 claims began. The Gold Hill Quartz
Mining Company began this early In 1851.
Lrong prior to 1861 534 of these claims had
been consolidated and they now compose
the very irregularly shaped territory cov
ered by the assailed oold Hill patent.
The Gold Hill mine, thus composed of
r claims, including a ledge, was
worked steadily, and in 1577 Rossiter W.
Raymond reported in the first Government
mining report that it had yielded $8,000,000.
At about this time the mine passed to the
present company, and new works were in
stalled. I 'mil last fall it continued pro
ducing and had reached the depth of liw
feet, with extensive lateral workings. Jn
1883 a pateni for the ground covered by
the 534 original claims was acquired with
out adverse proceedings.
Two years or bo ago a vein was discov
ered along the lower portion of this pat
ented ground, bui more than 300 feet from
the original vein. The Cold Hill company/
took about $5000 out of it in a short time.
This late discovery of new riches on thÂ«
oldest quartz claim in California may or
may not be singular. Then another vein
was found on this ground outside of the
300-fuot limit. The Peabody mine Â»H
then an old one, adjoining the GoÂ»d Hill,
operating at several hundred feet depth,
and the doubts ami issues suggested early
in this story arose. -At tne benest of the
dy company tne newly found vein
in the Gold Hill territory was duly located
last September by a man who promptly
sold to the Peaoody company. Tnis is the
Suum Quique claim, which covers the
vein but keeps out of the ."00-foot limit.
Another claim was similarly located on
Kill ground and called the Croesus.
Then Baron yon Schroeder promptly went
to court and asked that the Qoid Hill
company be ordered away from his min
ing claims. That ia the issue before the
court.
A. H. Ricketts. for the Pcabody Com
pany, pleads that although the Gold Hill
people could hold their claims without
patent, If they elected to secure a patent
they came under existing laws, and that
as the law forbids a lateral possession of
more than 300 feet the Interior Depart
ment was in error and the patent is null
and void in excess of that distance.
Hence, the vein lying beyond that dis- j
tance is open to location, and their rights
to all the ground beyond 300 feet from the
vein cease, Mr. McGraw argues that the
patent, having been granted, cannot be
attacked. He also argues that the Gold |
Hill Company would have been entitled to
534 separate patents, but that it had n
right to apply, as it did. for one con
solidated patent. Mr. Ricketts goes into
history, etc., in an interesting way, and
argues that those claims were placer
claims, and says in his submitted argu
ment:
"This is perhaps the first time in the
annals of mining jurisprudence where a
patent for a quartz lode location has been
attempted to be bolstered up by local
laws whirh did not recognize discovery
and develpoment aa essential to a lode lo
cation, and which mad>- surface ground,
and not the lode, the principal thing."
The legal question as to whether the
patent is void as to the excess over 300
La thus a grave one. The Peabody
Company Itself has deeded the surface
riphis of its own patented ground to va
rious i pie fur suburban uses, and the
Gold Hill Company may have done the
same, as far as is known. Much other
ground covered by mining patents has
been similarly sold. What becomes of
the title if it is more than 300 feet from
the vein?
Among other legal questions before
Judge Morrow is the objection that the
,il Court has no jurisdiction of the
Mr. Ricketts urges that any
involving a construction of the Federal
mining statute may be brought in a Fed
eral Court, and under the circumstances
bis contention, if substantiated, would
practically bring every mining case with
in that jurisdiction. The case and the de
cision will have a great bearing on this
point in mining jurisprudence every
where. Other important legal points add j
to the interest of the case.
The circumstances of the beginning of ;
quartz mining in California are thu? In

that good-for-littlo first mill In Gold
Mountain would be appreciated. One who [

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The two private shipyards at Genoa are
quite busy with naval work reconstruct-
ing and transforming foreign ships of war,
having in hand two Turkish ironclads,
the Argentine armored cruiser Garibaldi,
Scilla, an Italian wooden gunboat; Her
tha, an old wooden corvette of the Ger
man navy and the Russian corvette
Donetz.
There are 105 chaplains of the Church of
England attached to the service afloat in
tin- British navy, besides two Roman
Catholic chaplains at Portsmouth and
Devenport, who are classed as regular
officers. In addition there are three
Church of England, eighteen Roman
Catholic, seven Wosleyan and four Pres
byterian clergymen in the navy who re
ceive a fixed annual allowance, but are
not designated chaplains.
Abdul Hamid, Sultan of Turkey, pays
out of his own pocket for the remodeling
of the ironclads Mesovdloh and Tewfik at
the yard of Ansaldo, Genoa. The ex
pease will aggregate Mverol hundred
thousand dollars and the probabilities are
that he will be reimbursed in the near
future by the usual customary popular
subscriptions, voluntary or otherwise, col
lected from Armenians and other sub
jects.
The alterations to the Italian battle
ship Dandola have been completed. Her
four 105-ton guns have been removed and
four ten-inch of only twenty-nine tons
weight substituted, and the remainder of
the battery now consists of seven six-inch
and five 4.7-inch rille?. all quick-flrera.
The single mast has also been removed
and two military masts with fighting tops
have been put in. The new battery is a
vast improvement upon the old, for al
though the penetration of the discarded
105-ton guns was claimed to be about
thirty-four inches of wrought iron and
that of the ten-inch gun is only about
nineteen inches of wrought iron, the
former gun could only discharge one shot
for every ten minutes, while the smaller
gun can deliver one shot per minute.
The quick-firing six-inch and 4.7 inch in
crease the battery efficiency at least three
times over that of the same caliber guns
of the old breceh-loading typs.
The Coroner's jury in the case of the
boiler explosion on the British cruiser
Terrible found that the death Ox the fire
man was due to an accident, and that tha
officers were in no way to be blamed for
the mishap, but they recommended the
authorities to discontinue the use of weld
ed tubes. It appears that the Terrible
and Powerful are the only ships in the
British navy fitted with the Belleville
boiler having welded tube*. They are a
little Cheaper than solid drawn tubes, but
they are likely to be discarded sinre thi3
experience of "a two-weeks' cruise, during
which five tubes burst, by which one man
was killed and five were injured.
M. Lockroy, Minister of Marine of
France, was an actor of considerable abil
ity in his younger days. He was a son-in
law of Victor Hugo, and left the staj
devote exclusive attention to politics. Hl3
administration of naval affairs has evi
dently been appreciated, for he has pre
viously held office as Minister of Marine,
and he has introduced and carried into
effect many measures of reform in the
navy. Of late, however, he has acquired a
hobby, that of submarine boats, which.
subordinates all other affairs, and is
likely to make his future administration
less successful than it woulu be if he had
not become the victim of one solitary idea,
which other naval experts believe to bo
impracticable.
The British admiralty has placed or
ders with the Thames Iron Works and
Ship-building Company (Limited) of
Blackwall for the construction of two
UrFt class battlrships of 14,000 tons dis- 41
placement, at a cost exceeding 1.000.n00
pounds sterling. The directors of the
works have made arrangements for tak
ing over the famous engineering works
of Messrs. John Perm & Sons (Limited),
at Greenwich and Deptford, and will un
dertake the manufacture of the engines
of 18.000 horsepower required for these
vessels. This contract is the largest ever
entrusted by the admiralty to a single
firm, and together with the two battle
ships, the Albion for the British navy,
and the Shikishima for the Imperial Jap
anese navy of 13,000 tons and 15,000 tons
displacement, respectively, now building,
create a battleship record for the River
Thames and a notable triumph for tha
eight-hour day.
A French semi-official publication, some
thing like Brassey's Naval Annual, and
entitled "Memolres de l'Officer de la Ma
rine," gives a tabulated list of the effi
cient war vessel? in the seven principal
navies. No vessel launched twenty years
ago is included in the list nor are any of
the ships in course of construction con
sidered.

SALINAS, April 16.â That the dele
gates to the Grand Parlor, Native Sons
of the Golden West, will receive a royal
reception at the hands of the Sallnas
ites. and that they will be appropriately
entertained while here, is certain. The
finance committee has met with excel
lent success In getting Citizens to do
nate to the fund, and now that it is
collecting the subscriptions no difficulty
is experienced at all. It reports that
over $2000 has thus far been collected
out of $4500 subscribed. This amount
assures a successful celebration, as well
as a satisfactory entertainment, not
only of delegates to the Grand Parlor
but of the large gathering of others
who will visit Salinas during Native
Sons' week.
On the parade day an excursion will
be run from Monterey, Del Monte and
Pacific Grove, and one rrom Santa Cruz
and Watsonville, the former over the
Southern Pacific and the latter over the
Spreckuls narrow gauge road. On
Wednesday, the 26th, the Foresters of
America will have a fete day in Salinas.
Visiting lodges from Monterey. Castro
ville, Soledad, Watsonville. Santa Cruz
and other places will be here, and a
reception, ball and banquet Will be
given in their honor by the local court.
The decoration committee has about
completed plans for the oeautifyins: of
the city. Mr. Pratt the official dec
orator, arrived to-day and will com
mence york to-morrow. The first Idea
of an arch at the -function of Gabilan
and Main streets has been abandoned,
and in its stead a plan for a more elab
orately decorated area has been adorjt
ed. A line of flag.; and lanterns will be
put up the full length of Main street.
and also for a block each way on Gabi
lan and Alisal streets and Central ave
nue. Besides this, banners will be
stretched across these streets at short
intervals. There will be other artistic
and appropriate decorations.
The programme committee has ar
ranged its part of the work, and has a
list of events that will attract and en
tertain the multitude. The programme
in detail Is as follows:
The delegates will arrive here from
the north on the 1:39 o'clock train on
Sunday. Conterno's band of San Jose
will accompany them. The visitors will
be met at the train by Santa Lucia Par
lor, Native S.>ns of the Golden West,
Loaded by the Salinas City band, and
escorted to the headquarters in the Na
tive Sons' Hall, where they will regis
ter and be assigned to rooms. In the
ng Conterno's band will giva an
open-air concert.
On Monday morning the opening ses
sion ot the Grand Parlor will be held.

THE RELATION
OF WOMAN TO
THE GOSPEL
Rev. Wilson on Evils
of the Times.
CIVILIZATION A FAILURE
HOPES TO FOUND A HOME FOR
WORKING WOMEN.
An Able Sermon in Which the Speak
er Outlines a Practical Plan for
the Protection of the
Weaker Sex.
Not for many a day has a broader, more
liberal sermon issuofl out of any San
Francisco pulpit than that delivered last
night at Howard-street Methodist Epis
copal Church by the Rev. Dr. John A. B.
Wilson. Dr. Wilson dealt with woman's
place and woman's power In the propaga
tion of the gospel, not as they are but as
they would he were the conditions of the
day as they should be. He spoke to his
subject forcefully and practically, and
held the wrapt attention of his congrega
tion through the three-quarters of an
hour he required.
Dr. Wilson took his text from the fourth
chapter, third vorse of the Philippians,
"Hf-lp thnsp women who labor together
with us in thp gospel." "There are those
who tell us every day," said he, "that this
world is getting worse instead of better.
That crime is increasing and the gospel
more seldom heard. This is not true. I
can look around me and see Chinatown
and this wide-open city, and I can turn
again and lincl people who have lived here
for twenty or thirty years who will tell
me that both have improved morally in
that time; that crime has grown less and
that the gospel is heard in quarters which
never knew it before. And so it la in New
York and the other great cities â¢in the
East; the world is getting better and we
must help it to do so. We must put a
candle In the dark places and help those
to see who would but cannot.
"It is the women who must help us to
do this. From the time that band of
noble women helped Paul in ancient Rome
the propagation of the gospel has been
woman's proper mission, and they must
be enabled to help us now in our ex
tremity. We must all work and we must
remember that if all of us cannot build
houses we can at least lay a brick. So
many of us will not do anything unless
we can do a great big thing, and 1 want
to say to you that if you can not do 'a
great big thing,' then in the name of the
suffering humanity do a small thing. The
gospel has no wings to fly. no sails to
move It, nor any locomotive power behind
it It needs the human personality be
hind it. The gospel as a human uplift
needs labor in its propagation. It Is suc
ceeding so poorly to-day not because
there is not enough of it preached but be
cause there is not enough of it practiced.
"I have a quarrel with the conditions
of the times. They are wrong, but Ido
not know how to remedy them. Women
are forced Into the marts of trade and
with their weak strength compelled to
light against men for their bread and
k<pt away from the gospel. This is not a
Blzn of success, but a sign of failure in
our civilization. When our men have not
enough virility, enough manhood to take
care of our women and provide a shelter
fur them it is nothing less than failure.
At the same time, as many women say,
they cannot afford to give up a $600 posi
tion for a $300 man. This is not the right
condition, but, as I said, I do not know
how to remedy it. We must nnd a way.
It cannot be done in this generation, nor
in the next, but we must begin the work
that will give woman her proper place and
her rights and place her in that relation
to the gospel, as were the women when
the gospel was a thousand years and
more younger."
Dr. Wilson closed his sermon with a
sincere and powerful appeal for the
women who, compelled to work for sala
ries upon which they cannot live in the
big cities, are forced from the ways of
righteousness that they may live at all,
and he outlined a plan which he and hfa
wife and a number of the sturdy workers
with them are now engaged in furthering.
They have started on a small scale a home
for such women as he had spoken for
during the evening, with every promise
of success before them, and he requested
the moral and financial aid of every one
of his congregation.
AN ELOQUENT SPEAKER.
Lecturer W. M. Lowell Delivers an
Interesting Sunday Sermon.
Walter Myron Lowell of New York, who
has attained some renown as a lecturer,
gave another instance of his versatility
yesterday morning by delivering an elo
quent sermon before a large congregation
in Howard-street M. E. Church. He chose
as his subject "Pivoted, or the Parting of
the Ways," and for nearly a half hour
talked brilliantly on his theme. Dr. John
A. B. Wilson, pastor of the church, intro
duced the gentleman to his congregation
In a few fitting sentences. The young
preacher's tuneful voice and fine delivery
soon captivated his hearers, and they lis
tened to him with interest.
TJÂ»e speaker sketched the. great differ
ence between the rulers Herod and Jesus.
The first, he said, though outwardly the
Lord over much territory, was self-willed,
self-indulgent and servile. On the other
hand Christ had no glittering court, regal
insignia nor courtiers, but was pure and
gentle and seK-forgetful. Although the
difference between them was very great
they each possesses large resources for
the bestowal of gifts. Herod could say,
"To the half of my kingdom I give you";
Christ. "As thou wilt. Continuing. Mr.
Lowell said two women present them
sejves to our view. He spoke of Salome
as "no of them, and in glowing words de
scribed a fete in Herod's palace on the
night of a grand function, lie told of her
entrance and her obeisance at the foot of
Herod's throne, and then of her captivat
ing the King by her graceful dancing, and
of his offering Salome, her choice.
"While she is consulting with- her moth
er on what she should ask of the King,"
he said. "let us judge the second woman.
She is a Syro-Phoenician and has left her
afflicted daughter to search for the One
who can cure her; and when she asked
Him to heal her daughter, He said to her,
'Into thee as thou wilt.'
"In the tide of life," continued the
speaker, "we all have special moments of
opportunity." He eulogized John B. (>ough
fur swinging to the right side and told of
the great work he was doing in the cause
of temperance. He then dwelt on the fact
that many young men on reaching the
"parting of the ways" are undecided what
ro;i<i to take. He pointed out the sublim
ity of taking the path that led to God' a
kingdom and then outlined the evils that
arise when one takes the other. Return
ing to Salome, he told of her return and
the ignoble choice she made. Mr. Lowell
said others choose just as wildly. Some,
like the Syro-Phenician woman, choose
for others and the best things.
Mr. Lowell intends remaining in this
city for a few weeks and will deliver sev
eral h-ctures.
DELIVERS FAREWELL SERMON.
Archdeacon Emery Ceases to Be Rec
tor of the Church of the Advent.
Archdeacon J. A. Emory df-livered his
farewell sermon as rector of the Church
of the Advent yesterday morning, review
ing the work of the church during the
four years he has boon in charge and be
speaking the same cordial help Â»o his suc
cessor that has been. accorded him in his
labors. During his rectorship tlr> Liabili
ties of the church have been reduced from
J46.1&5 to $17,500. The resignation of the
rector was in part due to the desire of
Bishop Nichols that he should be free to
devote all his time to his duties as Arch
deacon, to which office he was appointed
nearly two years ago, but that was not
the sole reason. As stated in his letter of
resignation he feels that he has in a large
measure exhausted his resources in his ef
forts to wipe out the debt of the church.
and that a new rector with a new circle
of friends may be able to clear the church
of debt.
Rev. Douglas F. Forrest, D.D. , who has
held Important cures in Baltimore and
Washington, D. C, has been choson by
unanimous vote of the vestry to succeed
Archdeacon Emery as rector. He comes
with a reputation as a hard worker and a
fine preacher, and the church is -bound to
prosper under his charge. Archdeacon
Emery will hereafter be found in the dio
cesan house on California street, his new
duties making him a sort of chief as
sistant to the Bishop.

UNFORTUNATE PEACEMAKER.
For Trying to Stop a Pig-ht a New
Policeman Receives a Thrashing.
Policeman Amend, a recent addition to
the force, had an experience yesterday
morning that will last him for a long
time. He was in citizen's clothes and
while passing along Market street, near
Eighth, he endeavored to arrest three
young men who were fighting. They re
sented his interference and jumped on
him. He fought bravely and quite a
crowd gathered, but as Amend did not dis
play his star the crowd did not Interfere.
The. fight was continued down Eighth
street till Amend shouted to the crowd
that he was an officer and called for as
sistance. This had the effect of making
the three fignters nurry away through an
alley.
A message had been sent to the South
ern Police Station that the officer was be
ing beaten to death and Sergeant Donovan
and several policemen jumped into the
patrol wagon and drove to the scene, but
they were too late. Policeman Butter
worth had also driven round in his buggy,
but he was not on time.
Yesterday afternoon Andrew Desmond,
a teamster, and Joseph Murphy, a painter,
were arrested and Identified by Amend as
two of the men who attacked him. A
charge of battery was booked against
them. Amends lips were cut and he was
generally bruised.

GUNS TO BOOM FOB DEWEY.
General Shafter Will Fire a Salute in
Honor of the Naval Hero.
There is no longer any doubt of the
success of the Dewey Day celebration on
May 1, which is being arranged under the
auspices of the Pacific Coast Association
of the Native Sons of Vermont. In fact,
there has never been any doubt of its
success, but it was desired that a salute
in honor of the hero of the battle of Ma
nila Bay should be fired by a battery of
Uncle Sam's artillery stationed at this
post, and it was not until yesterday that
the projectors of the affair were in
formed that this feature of the pro
gramme could be carried out.
Just before Major-General Shafter de
parted for the East Judge Belcher, presi
dent of the Vermont Association, ad
dressed a note to him requesting that the
salute be fired. He received the follow
ing answer:
Headquarters Department of California, San
Francisco, April 4, 1899.
Hon. Edward A. Belcher. President Pacific
Coast Association, Native Sons of Vermontâ My
Dear Judge: I regret very much that I do not
possess the authority to authorize the expendi
ture of ammunition necessary for the salute
that you request. I fully accord with your
views as to the propriety of this action, and
th" Rood effect this action will have upon the
growing youth of this country.
I have been unexpectedly ordered to Wash
ington. and expect to be there within the next
six days. Upon my arrival there I shall bring
this matter to the attention of the Secretary
of War. and if his consent can be procured will
notify you of the fact, and will then very glad
ly assist in making the festivities of May 1 a
success. Very sincerely yours,
WILLIAM R. BHAFTER.
Major General. U. S. V.
That General Shafter did not forget his
promise is shown by the following tele
gram received last night:
niFFALO. N. V., April 16, 1899.
To Edward A. Belcher. San Franciscoâ Will
arrange for salute on Dewey day when I re
turn. SHAFTER, Major General.
The preparations for the celebration
are rapidly nearing completion and the
jinniversary of the day on which Dewey
dost roved the Spanish fleet oft Cavite and
electrified the world promises to be a big
day in the metropolis of the Pacific
coast.
REDUCED GAS RATE.
Aigeltinger Order Will Be Adopted
by Supervisors To-Day.
The Supervisors at their meeting to-day
â will fix the gas rate for consumers at !
J] 50 a thousand cubic feet and the house- I
holders may now congratulate themselves
that the struggle for a reduction has not
been barren of results. This is the rate
Introduced by Supervisor Aigeltinger at
thft last meeting of the board and it is un
derstood that the minority members will
vote for it, though the reduction is not
as great as they would like it to be. They
do not care to be placed in. the position of
opposing a lower rate.
The reduced rate will not prevent the
company from putting a lower figure into
effect if it should be forced to meet com- |
petition. The Aigeltinger resolution pro- '
vides that the new rate shall go into effect
May 1. . . â¢
Tho existing rate for street lamps, which
is 11 cents a night, and that for incandes
cent lamps. 10 cents, will not be disturbed,
at least for the present. In July a new
contract will be entered into.
It is highly probable that another in
vestigation into the; cost of the production
of gas will be begun on Tuesday, not
withstanding the fact that the Finance
Committeee went very thoroughly into the
subject last month. One of the majority
in the board takes the stand that the cost
of rmmufacture, which was made out to ;
be 4<" cents a thousand cubic feet, is j
ridiculously low. lie claims that the cost !
of collection and other expenditures will \
make the cost approach $1 a thousand feet j
and that the company would be unable ;
to pay dividends on the stork invested j
unless a reasonable rate is passed. An
other investigation, he thinks, will show !
the truth of his statement.
Injured by a Fall.
John Dostich, a laborer employed at the !
marble works at 244 Brannan street, fell j
a distance of fifteen feet yesterday while
descending a stairway from an upper
story of the building. He was removed to
the City and County Hospital and pieced
under the care of Dr. Lane, v.'ho r.p to a
late hour last night, was unable to state .
whether his injuries would prove fatal or
not. Dostich struck on the jagged edges
of a lot of marble slabs.

" Dear Friend â A year ago I was a
great sufferer from female weakness, i
My head ached all the time and I would
get so dizzy and have that all gone
feeling in the stomach and was so
nervous and restless that I did not
know what to do with myself.
" My food did me no good and I had a
bad case of whites. I wrote to you and
after taking Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound as directed, I can
truly say that I feel like a new woman
and cannot tell you how grateful I am
to you.
"I have recommended it to all my
friends and have given it to my

splendidly. May you live many years
to help our suffering sisters." â Mrs. G.

Over eighty thousand

WHISKY AND A CHILD.
Little Robert Taylor Nearly a /ictim
of Alcoholic Poisoning.
A pint of whisky nearly caused the
death of little Robert Taylor yesterday
afternoon. The lad, who is about 5
yean of age and who resides at 238
Buena Vista tÃernal Heights), dis
â  â¢ â¢ â <] a bottle of the intoxicant about
the house, and proceeded to stow it away
with the avidity of a water-front lush.
! About an hour afterward he sta^^ered
into a room where his parents were and
; announced that he was drunk. At first
i they thought him to be joking, but an
investigation which resulted in the find
ing of the empty flask disclosed the truth,
and he was immediately given an â "netic.
Dr. W. R. Scroggs was sent for, but
when he arrived the child was uncon
scious and in a precarious condition. The
physician, after administering available
remedies, called an ambulance and the lit
tle sufferer was taken to the City and
County Hospital. His pulsation dropped
! from nearly 150 to almost nothing, and
for a time his life was despaired of. He
remained unconscious until late last
night, when the doctors announced that
he was slowly recovering.

RESHIPPING TEA.
Duties on the Fragrant Hevb Are Be
ing Paid at This Port Under a
New System.
Since Congress Imposed a duty of 10
cents per pound upon tea, up to April 1,
1599, there have been collected at the port
of San Francisco $851.61160 duties on the I
fragrant herb. Outside of the addition ;
to the receipts at the San Francisco Cus
tom-house the import duty on tea has
benefited the commerce of San Francisco
in another way. Heretofore it has been
the custom for importers of tea designed
for sale and consumption outside of Cali
fornia to ship to New York, pay the duty
there and reship to St. Louis. Kansas \
City, Chicago, Denver and other markets. I
This custom is being abandoned and im
porters are adopting: the practice of pay
ing the duty at this port and shipping
direct to the Eastern markets from San
â  Francisco.
â  Thus, instead of shipping to New York '.

EPPERSON AN EX-CONVICT.
Diamond Thief Served a Long Term
in San Quentin Prison.
W. C. Epperson, the diamond thief who
is held at the City Prison for his ex
ploits in the jewelry stores of W. C.
Tabor and S. Schwarz, was positively
identified last night as an ex-convict and
old hand in his particular line. Detec
tive Hodgkins of Oakland called at the
prison and identified Epperson as "War
ren Wilson, who served six months in 1897
in the Santa Clara County Prison for a
similar offense. After his time was up
Epperson, alias Wilson, went to Oakland
and trWl his arts on a jewelry store at
that place. lie was arrested and con
victed of grand larceny and on March
17, IR9B, was sentenced to fifteen months'
imprisonment at San Quentin.
On the 2d of this month Epperson, or
Wilson, was released from prison, and
the very next day was in' this city at his
old tricks. He had a short shrift, how
ever, and the indications point to a long
return trip for him to State's Prison.

F. W. Johnson Arrested.
F. W. Johnson has been booked at
the Seventeenth-street station on a
warrant sworn out by T. P. Cullen of
Redwood City, who charged him with
grand larceny. It appears that Johnson,
who was engaged In the hay and grain
business, had a carload of grain consigned
to him from Cullen. Having disposed of
the grain, which was valued at $1993, he
failed, so Cullen alleges, to account for
the proceeds; hence the warrant for his
arrest. His bail was fixed by Judge Gra
ham at J2500.

HARTMAN LOSES
THE GAME AND
HIS SITUATION
Harris* Men Are De
feated Again.
A PAIR OF COSTLY ERRORS
SANTA CRUZ TAKES ANOTHER
GAME FROM SACRAMENTO.
Oakland Goes Up Against the Real
Thing at San Jose and Dis
aster Marks the Out
come.
Young Mr. Hartman lost the frame for
Hank Harris at Recreation Park yester
day afternoon, and simultaneously he lost
his Job with that Industrious but unfor
tunate aggregation. Mr. Hartman wan
dered away from the Siwash reservation
at Seattle with nine other talented and
ambitious exponents of the national game
1 and eventually brought up in this city.
After several spasmodic attempts to lure
pork and beans money from an indifferent
public, the wanderers temporarily aban
doned the diamond and set up house
keeping in a vacant woodshed at North
Beach. Their Bufferings through the
rainy season are of too recent date to
I need repeating now; but with the bud
fling spring came new contracts and
they speedily forget their sorrows.
Hartman's backstop work with the Se
attles had made so favorable an Impres
sion with I'nclf- Hank that when thi> looal
baseball impressario began his search f<>r
talent at the beginning of the season the
catcher was one of the first to be given a
job.
But yesterday's game saw his finishâ
; with the local team, at any rateâ for two
| Algeric blunders in the fourth, which gave
' the Watsonville team two runs and the
game, were too much for Harris to for
j give and forget. From the beginning of
the game Hartman had manifested cvi
! dence of eccentricity, particularly in
throwing to bases; but in the fourth inn
ing he sealed his doom. Harper opened
with a single to left, and was followed by
Franks, who wns safe on Riley's error,
Harper going to second. McCarthy went
to bat, and the first ball pitched got away
from Hartman, permitting both base
runners to advance a notch. Harris
called Sullivan in to catch, sending l'yne
to first and Hartman to center. Mc-
Carthy lifted the hall high In the air,
and Hartman waited for It tn come down.
When it did it struck his hands fairly and
bounced out again, letting Harper and
Franks home. Hartman â jyas called to
the bench. Fitzpatrick taking his place
in the field. Uncle talked to the young
man more in sorrow than In anger, tell
ing him that he might be all right for Se
attle and the Northwest league, but Cal
ifornia had advanced beyond the game of
1870; he might catch cold or a streetcar,
but he couldn't catch for the San Fran
cisco team. Hartman shed his uniform
and a few tears and sallied forth to look
for another job. With "Tacks" Parrott
and his doughnut-wooing cornet on the
other side of the continent, the world
looks dark to the unhappy Hartman just
now. But such Is the fortune of base
ball.
Yesterday's game also brought woe to
another youth. Lawler, who hns been
making a bluff at covering right field for
Watsonville, satisfied Manage Streuo
that he was out of his fitment, bo last
night he received his discharge. What
I.awler needs is a billet with an under
taker; baseball is too rapid for his phleg
matic disposition. Streub will play his
change pitcher in right until Harden gets
into condition, and then he will have hlB
team complete.
Notwithstanding these two unhappy oc
currences the game was replete with epi
sode and kept the 6000 spectators shouting
from start to finish. Pretty playÃ abound
ed in bewildering profusion, and while the
crowd showed more loyalty to the home
team than has been the case in past sea
sons, the good work of the visitors was
generously applauded. The star play of
the day was made by Franks in the fifth
inning, when he made a Jerry Denny left
handed pickup of Hllderbrandt's scorcher
and fielded the batsman out at first before
Hilderbrandt could get a dozen feet on
his journey.
Iberg and Harper were the opposing
twirlers, and the beet-sugar man had the
better of the argument. He -was more
successful in preventing hits when hits
were needed, struck out the same number
of men as the other and besides was
steadier. In addition, he was accorded
much better support, and therein lies the
secret of the victory. The San Franciscos
ordinarily are terrific hitters, but when |
they go up against such a pitcher as Har
per their slugging abilities will not offset
their own bungles. Four errors aside from
Hartman's brace of misdeeds had some
bearing on the score. But there is one
thing about them the public admires, and
that is they go for everything in sight, no
matter how difficult it is to reach.
The bitterness of defeat is sweetened In
a measure, however, by the consoling re
flection that Sacramento having dropped
two games to the lobsters, all the teams
are bunched.
San Francisco got a hit but no runs in
the first inning, while Watsonville set
tled down to accumulating tallies right at
the outset. Franks, the first man up, tore
off a double, went to third on King's error
of McCarthy's drive to Riley, whereby
Josh attempted to field Franks out.
Courtney's single sent the runner home,
but McCarthy, who also attempted to
score on the hit. was nipped at the plate
by Mullrr, who made a great throw home.
Selna was given his base, but Flake was
assisted out at first by Riley.
The second inning brought another run
to Watsonville. Hayes opened with a
single, was sacrificed to second by 1/aw
ler, went to third on Harper's long fly to
Pyne and scored on Franks' single.
Another notch was cut in the stick in
the third, when with one out Selna
plucked a single, stole second, was ad
vanced to third on Riley's error of Mor
row's grounder and scored on a wild pitch
by I berg.
Frisco awakened to a resilization of its
perilous position in the fourth. Riley and
Krug led off with singles and Sullivan
was Â«iven a pass, filling the bases. Hil
derbrandt flew to Plake and then Muller
drove a grounder to the same man. Riley
made a dash for the plate and scored,
while Plake threw Sullivan out to Mc-
Carthy at second. Krug also got the ball
to the plate ahead of him, completing a
beautiful double play and retiring the side
with one run.
Then came the double disaster to Hart
man and the Frisco team. That ended the
run-getting for Watsonville. but the
locals took one in the sixth and another
in the seventh. John Patrick Parnell
Whltewings Cahill made his debut as an
umpire and filled the position most ac
ceptably. The score:

There was a large attendance of dele
gates at the meeting of the Pacific Asso

Ing, football, in-dnor and out-door base
ball, came up for acceptance or rejection.
Though the A. A. U. does not control
these sports, the Pacific Association de
cided to assume jurisdiction over them on
this coast. H. A. Keeler. George James
and H. Hauser were appointed a commit
tee to get the constitution and by-laws
printed. The presence of John I. Nolan

such recommendations as they may wish.
The committees will confer with public
officials and others as to the actual re
quirements of the various departments of
the city government. Statutory expendi
tures fixed by law will be recommended
to be segregated from those of a flexible
nature and unnecessary expenditures
eliminated. It is understood that the
work will be thorough and exhaustive and
the conclusions of value to the city and
to the authorities in fixing- the next tax

HORRIFIED SINGERS FACE
TO FACE WITH A TRAGEDY
)RSHIPER3 at Grace Episcopal Church yesterday >
would never have suspected from the demeanor of the V
embers of the male choir the harrowing experience A
through which they had passed only a few short hours i
before. The voices of the choristers rose strong and clear Q
In the "Te Deum." and shrilled gladly in the Jubilate." â Â£
but In their minds lingered a sorrow on which their lips Q
were mute. Their robes concealed a sadness their -f
tongues would not betray. 6
Saturday afternoon, as Is their custom, the members 4
of the choir assembled in the church to rehearse for the Q
Sunday services. Choir Director and Organ'st Holt was in â +
his place and the rehearsal had proceeded for half an q
hour without unusual incident, when an unexpected event V
cast its first shadow before. The mellowed .sunlight A
streaming through one of the stained glass windows on _Â£
the Stockton-street side of the church was suddenly dis- A
turbed by the passage into It of some dark object, which, .
as the startled choristers looked, assumed the shape of a J
woman, leaning on the iron railing which guards pass- V
ers-by from possible falls into the area way. Before the -i
surpliced singers could make a move they saw separating Â£
from the shadow of a woman a smaller shadow, ,
which fell Into the area way, ten feet below, with a thud j
that betrayed the substance behind the shadow. As it *â 
struck there were wailing sounds from the area way, -4
followed by the rapid Hitting of the female shadow. Â©
All sorts of ideas chased each other through the minds 4
of the surprised choristers at these untoward occur- O
rences. Visions of heartless mothers and deserted babes -4
were uppermost. The wails and the flitting of the female Â©
shadow were corroborative, and it was determined to go >
at once to the rescue of the substance of the castaway Â©
shadow. " â +
One chorister, whose name has not been handed down Q
to fame, rushed, more daring than the rest, to the win- -4
flow, threw It open and In a moment was In the area 6
way. In a trice his eyes were fastened on a bundle 4
wrapped in a newspaper. It moved and emitted sounds q
of distress. It was soon unwrapped and the choristers _Â£
beheld two kittens, unable to stand, starving and sore- q
eyed, mewing piteously after their hard fall. â ;=â¢ '.-. i
"â¦" Director Holt organzied a relief expedition, -the result of which was a Â©
O plentiful supply of bread and milk for the deserted orphans. They were soon V
+ Been to be two far gone, however, for such succor, and It took no practical "JT
Â« eye to determine that the forsaken felines were not long for this world. In a Â©
~r spirit of humanity it was determined to drown them. They were submerged 4
â *" in the presence of all the choir, except the basso. Homer Henley, who was Â©
O bo overcome that even his spectacles ran briny tears. i
â¢â¦â  The unfortunate kittens were turned over to the Janitor, who, not think- X
Q ing it necessary to notify the Coroner, gave them temporary sepulture in the Â£*

ATTORNEY LANE HANDS
DOWN THREE OPINIONS
REPLIES TO QUESTIONS OF AD
VISORY EXPERT PLATT.
Certain Consigned Goods, Insurance
Premiums and Stocks of Corpor
ations Outside the State
Are Taxable.
City and County Attorney Franklin K.
Lane has replied to the communication
sent him by the advisory expert to the
nai Property Assessment Committee,
iG. Platt The reply of Attorney
is In the form of three opinions on
made by Mr. Platt, and
appear to settle some doubtful matters in
regard to property which has hitherto
been exempt from taxation in this city.
In his reply to the first question Mr.
I.ane declares that where consigned goods
have passed from the hands of the origi
nal importer or into another State they
are taxable. On this subject he Btatea
that there is an opinion by the Board of j
lizatloD which conflicts with the
statute Id such, cases made and provided
and th< Statute must govern.
He quol Slon of Chief Justice
Field, In which three of his colleagues dis
:, that "Foreign goods Imported into
the Tinted States In the hands of the
original inn tnnot 1-e taxed. It.
would be putting a restriction against
commerce which the Federal Government
would not allow."
The passing of floods from the hands of
the Importer puts another status t<> the
case, however. In regard to goods going
into another State, the opinion might ap
ply to forHgn merchandise entered in the
State of New York and arriving here in
transit. This point, however, is now be
ing considered by Collector Jackson, who
will refer It to the department at Wash
ington, along with the otbers now under
consideration.
The second question put by Mr. Platt in
volves premiums due and unpaid in course
of collection for insurance, whether lift-,
I\rc <>r marine, and all outstanding In
. and Mr. Lane declares that
they shall be considered as solvent
ts, no matter where the office of the
insurance company may be. The attempts
heretof Â»re to assess such solvent credits
have been defeated by the representatives
claiming that the premiums are due to
the hi Bltuat< d In another State
or in a foreign country and not an asset
of the company in the State.
The third opinion rendered by Mr. Lano
thai stocks of corporations having
property In California cannot be taxed. He
holds that to tax the stock and franchises
of a corporation in the same State, is
double taxation, which is unconstitutional.
He contends that only the franchise
should he taxed If the property nnd invest
â¢" the money is in this Btate.
On the other hand, all stocks of cor
>ns where the property is outside
of tl â  assessable and must be
taxed. This will apply to a number of
mining and other companies whose stock
is hi -Id hen-, but the properties are else
â 
that the way has boon made clear
rt Plati will proceed to ret the
isary Information in order to make -,i
ipervisbra as to the amount
<>f taxable property of the kind here
enumerated, and it is expected that a
larse revenue will be turned into the
treasury from the Increased assessments.

HER DEATH UNEXPECTED.
Mrs. Joseph G. Eastland Dies Sud
denly While on a Visit to
Los Gatos.
Mrs. Joseph G. Eastland, widow of the
well-known capitalist, passed quietly
away at Lob Gatos yesterday. The news
of her demise will be a sad blow to her
numerous friends, as she was beloved by
them all. The deceased leaves two sons
to mourn her loss.
Mrs. Eastland was one of two daugh
ters of Colonel C. C. Landers. Her sister
married Dr. Urquhart, who was a surgeon
in the United States navy.
The deceased was married to Joseph G.
Eastland. and the union resulted in three
children being- b.orn to them. A daughter

rents. Her husband was the first secre
tary of the San Francisco Gaslight Com
pany, and at the time of his death, not
many years ago, he was largely interested
in the gas works at Oakland.
Mrs. Eastland was a distinguished
member of society. Her charming and
brilliant conversational powers ma<i'
a leader In her set. While unostentatious
in dress and equipage, she was a lavish
entertainer. She was also famed for her
charity, and many a poor family to-day

HOBSON" TOOK HIS JOB.
Captain Miller of the Badger, For
merly of the Merrimac, Has
Arrived.
Another hero of the late war arrived
early yesterday morning. He is Captain

cruiser Badg.-r.
â When the Merrimac was picked as the

tain. He offered his services to the coun

grined that a younger man should be
s< li cted to have the. honor of piloting his
ship to destruction in the face of im
minent peril. The reports that came
from the theater of war at that tim*
tell of Miller in a sorry plight when he
learned that h'- was not to escort his
ship through the channel. The tears
streamt-d down his face as he saw Hob
pon and the selected crew perform the
task which he coveted.
Captain Miller will remain In port un
til the Samoan commission is ready to
leave for the islands.

YON SCHMIDT
TRAGEDY CLAIMS
ANOTHER VICTIM
Mrs. Welch Stricken
With Apoplexy.
SHE SAW THE STABBING
THE TERRIBLE AFFAIR ALMOST
TURNED HER MIND.
A Duel With Daggers at an Oakland
Theater Brought About a Climax
Which Will Likely Prove
Fatal.
Alameda Office. San Francisco Call,
142S Park Street. April 16.
The horrible trapedy enacted in Ala
meda last Sunday has had such a serious
effect upon Mrs. Dennis Welch that the
unfortunate woman may lose her life as
a result of the shock of being an eye
witness to the M<" dthirsty deed of the
late Captain yon Schmidt.
Mrs Welch Is at the Oakland Receiving
Hospital, where she was taken from an
Oakland Theater last night, suffering |
from a stroke of apoplexy, brought on by j
j a Btabbing scene on the stage j
â¢which recalled to her mind too vividly the
terrible sight of lasi Sunday when Captain
yon Schmidt hacked his wife to death
with a dagger and then plunged the blade
through his own heart.
Mrs Well h Is the wife of Police Of
ficer | ich of the Ahimeda force.
Their home adjoins the residence on San
Jose avenue that was occupied by Mrs.
yon Schmidt and her five little children.
Although t it was generally supposed I
that no human eye had witnessed the
bloody deed that wiped out the lives of
Mr and Mrs. yon Schmidt. Mrs. Welch
Eaw it all as she Bat at her dining-room
window, which overlooks the back yard
of the neighboring premises. The fact
was kept from the public and the authoii
that Mrs. Welch had
been in 111-health, wae a sufferer from
- and It was feared that
were called upon to recite the hor
rible details of the bloody tragedy her
mlr.d would give way under the strain.
As it wa.s, the affair visibly affected her.
The bi Sunday made an indelllble
Impression on the woman's thoughts and j
so preyed upon her mind that her family i
anticipated the worst results. To her I
..!>. with whom shi a the !
dual tragedy, she repeatedly said: "G<>d
: that I should ever see such a
igain. It will drive me crazy, j
The picture of that man stabbing his <
wife and then killing himself is constant
ly before me. 1 cannot drive the vision
away."
In an endeavor to divert her mind from
thoughts of ttie tragedy. Officer Welch
had been serdii'g bis wife to various
places of amusement. Saturday night, ac
companied bj her daughter, she went to
the Dewey Op< â¢â  in Oakland.
"The Denv.r Express," an extremely
sensational melodrama, was the produc
tion. During the second act there was a
stabbing scene. Uke a Hash it recalled
Vividly to the mind of Mrs. Welch visions
of th< imidt tragedy.
"My God, my God!" she exclaimed,
"take me away from here," and then ut
tering a piercing shriek, she sank back In
her seat unconscious.
She was taken to ;h>-> Receiving Hos
pital, were it was found that she was suf
fering from a severe stroke of apoplexy.
Drs. Stratum. Sanborn. Rowe and
Porter have been in constant attendance
on her during the day. and this evening
they hold out little hope of her recovery.
Dr. G. i' Reynolds of this city, her family
physician, has i â â¢ r to hold a con
6ul"tatio!i with the attending doctors.
Her hi;=band and children visited her
during the day, but she was unable to
recognise them. Officer Welch is at the
le of hla wife and is prostrated over
the affair.
SAILOR IMMIGRANTS.
They Must Be Classed as Aliens Un
less They Started From This
Country as Seamen.
Immigration Commissioner North has
received a letter from tho Com
missioner General nf Immigration at
Washington with reference to the land-
Ing of snips' crews. The following is the
gist:
There instructions were given to prevent "vio
lations" of the immigration laws, either through
the carelessness or collusion of masters and
agents of vessels, the view being taken that
mch arrivals are to be regarded as seamen
until the conclusion of the voyage for which
they signed. On arrival at the terminal port
their status is the same aR that of any other
alien who peeks a landing in the United
Etatfs, and, therefore, that, irrespective of
the opinions of the mafters and agents of the
vessels bringing them to our shores or of their
own representations as to the proposed dura
tion of their stay, they should be treated In
r'l rf*i*-cts as alien Immigrants. *
Of course, the requirements of the law as
to manifesting Immigrants at the port of em
barkation do not apply in the case of aliens of
the class urder consideration, for they w~re
Fearr.en at the time of departure for this coun
try and continued such, in accordance with
the tenv.s of their agreement, until their ar
r.va.! at their deÂ«tlratlon.
Union Bible Class.

JOHN L POSES AS A
RAILWAY ENGINEER
To Evade Arrest at Astoria the Ex-
Champion Escapes on a
Locomotive.
ASTORIA, April 16.â John L. Bullivan,
whose company appeared here to-night,
was compelled to hide to prevent arrest.
The church people of the city swore out
a warrant for the arrest of Sullivan on.
a charge of violating the law by appear
ing in a boxing contest on Sunday. Man
ager Selig of Fisher's Opera-house was
charged with the offense of conducting a
theater on the Sabbath.
The warrant for the arrest of Sullivan
was placed in the hands of Constable
Wickman, and that officer tried to serve
It. Sullivan had been told of the officer's
coming and was not to be found. W hlle
the performance was still going on Sulli
van stole quietly out of the stage en
trance and made his way to his special
train which was scheduled to pull out at
11 o'clock for Victoria. Officers were at
the depot to arrest him, but he took refuge
in the engine and thus eluded his pur
suers.
Sullvan donned the garb of an engineer
at the depot and was at the throttle
when the train pulled out.
BRASS BUTTON SAVES
A POLICEMAN'S LIFE
Stops a Bullet Fired by a Los Angeles \
Rough Who Was Resisting
Arrest.
LOS ANGELES. April 16.â The sacred
precincts of St. Vibian's Cathedral, on J
Main street, were disturbed at an early
hour this morning by a stabbing and
shooting affray in which three partici
pants were slashed with knives and sev
eral policemen had close calls for their
lives. The wounded men are Bruce Mc-
Nutt. a waiter; Ralph Kern, a hackman,
and Patrick J. Stack, an ex-saloon-keeper.
None of the men received serious injuries.
When the police arrived on the scene
McNutt and Kern were placed under ar
rest without difficulty, but Stack, who had
retreated to his lodgings in the neighbor
hood, resisted arrest and shot at four or
the officers, one bullet striking officer
Rico Thanks to a big brass button, !
which stopped the bullet, he received no
bodily injury.
The cause of the affray Is somewhat or
'a mystery, as the thre* participants tell |
conflicting stories. Stack claims he was |
set upon by McNutt and Kern without
provocation while he was passing the
cathedral, one of the men slashing him
about the head with a knife. In defend-
Ing himself he drew his own pocket- .
knife and cut both Kern and McNutt j
about the face and hands.
McNutt and Kern claim that Stack,
without any provocation, attacked them
with a knife first and that they simply j
acted in self-defense. All three men |
were the worse for liquor. When the police
knocked at Stack's door he refused them !
admittance and they were compelled to j
force the door. As soon as this was ao i
complished Stack commenced shooting at I
the officers, who returned the fire, but
none of the shots were effr>ctivf>. the bat
tle being carried on in the dark. The
police then retreated for reinforcements '
and after some parleying with Stack, who i
had succeeded in barring the door again. ;
he submitted to arrest and was landed !
in Jail without further trouble.
PENNSYLVANIA WILL
ELECT NO SENATOR
Legislative Session Drawing to a
Close, With the Deadlock Un
broken.
HARRISBURO. Pa.. April 16.â The
Legislature will adjourn sine die at noon
on Thursday next and the present out
look indicates that a United States Sen
ator will not be elected. The announced
decision of Mr. Quay to remain in the
field will. It is believed, retain for him
the votes of most, if not all, of his fol
lowers to the end. The chance of any
other candidate receiving sufficient votes
to elect is rendered extremely doubtful.
particularly as there is no sign' of a
brÂ« ak from the ranks of the Democrats
who have steadfastly voted as a unit for
their party candidate. Three separate
conferences of Republican legislators
have been called for to-morrow night.
It is said that an earnest endeavor will
be made by some of the legislators to
bring about some compromise or agree
ment by which the deadlock can be
broken.

Cool Reception by the Elite of
Seville.

spondent of the Daily Mail, recounting
an interview he had with Madame Emma

empty seats. The opera was "Lucia di
Lainmermoor." In the second act all the
elite arrived together, but turned their
backs to the stage and talked ostenta
tiously until the end of the opera, when,
on returning to acknowledge a burst of
applause Nevada was roundly hissed.
At Madrid the Queen Regent was in
formed of the occurrence. Her Majesty
invited Nevada to a soiree at the palace
and presented to her a diamond and sap
phire bracelet.
Nevada arrived here in a state of the
greatest indignation.

the city before the meeting of the peace ;
conference on May 18.
Assuming that the statement of the !

HE NOW FAVORS SUFFRAGE
WOMEN AT SACRAMENTO TO
SWAY LEGISLATORS,
Mexican Methods Are So Repugnant
That It Is the Duty of Citizens
to See They Do Not
Prevail.
I HAVE decided not to leave
California, even to accept a
more lucrative pastorate,
for I consider it to be my duty
as a minister, as a citizen and
as a man to stay wii.ere I am
and to do all in my power to
prevent any attempt that may
be made to send Colonel Burns
to the United States Senate.
This course I consider my
sacred duty. â Rev. Barton
Perry, chaplain of the Legis
lature.
Oakland Office San Francisco Tall, '
90S Broadway. April 16. i
The old story that a call from a con- j
gregatlon offering a larger salary must of
necessity be "a call from the Lord" and
therefore to be obeyed does not apply to
the case of Rev. Barton Perry of the
rresbyterlan Church of San Leandro.
He announced to his congregation this \
morning that he had decided to Btay i
where he is.
The chaplain's reasons were given at
some length and were somewhat of a
surprise to his people, who had been led
to believe that he would accept the call
from Carson City, Nev.
"It is true that I have been offered a
pastorate at Carson City," he said, "with
a salary just twice as large as that paid
to me by this church. I have decided for â 
many reasons to stay here. You all know |
that I am chaplain of the State Legisla- i
ture. During my stay at the capital I j
saw much of the inside ways of the poll- j
tlcians who are working to make Dan j
Burns a I'nited States Senator. I fought
such tactics and shall continue to do so.
"What I saw there has almost con- I
verted me to woman suffrage. I have j
never been very enthusiastic on that sub
ject, but when I saw the purpose for
which women of the lowest station of so
ciety were being used 1 changed my '
mind. If this class of woman. 1 thought,
be initiated into politics, how much more
necessary It is that the nobility of
womanhood should be permitted to ex
ercise its influence in the opposite direc
tion.
"In the interest of public morals every
Christian should do everything possible '.
to prevent such practices. I shall stay
right here and do what I consider to be
my duty."

THE NATIONAL GUAED,
The Commander in Chief Will An
nounce the â djutant General and
Major General Before May.
Those who are most deeply Interested in
National Guard matters In this State arÂ«
anxiously waiting to learn what decision
Governor Gage, the commander in chief,
has reached in the matter of selecting an
adjutant general, an assistant adjutant
genera] and a major general. It is said
that he lias declared he will make the
appointment in each case before the Ist
of May and that he may defer the an
nouncement until the latter part of the
current month.
During the past week but little has
licen done in the matter of putting the
guard In shape. All the officers of the
companies of the Fifth Raiment except
those of C and D have reported at bri
gade headquarters, but as yet the muster
rolls of the companies have not been for
warded. There- is delay in preparing
these, as certain questions propounded
by the major general have to be an
swered, and there Is some difficulty in a
number of the companies as to under
standing what is wanted by the major
general.
As soon as all the muster rolls shall
have been sent in and It appears that
there are a sufficient number of men in
each company to form a regiment of the
minimum strength, then there will be is
sued an order for the election of a colonel,
vice Fairbanks, resigned. Should Lieu
tenant Colonel Whltton, who is now in
command, be promoted, there will also
be an order for the election of a lieuten
ant colonel.
The Naval Militia Is now working under
the new tactics of the United States
navy. Last Tuesday night there was a
drill In artillery, which is now part of the
tactics.
The Naval Militia has not received its
State allowances for three quarters, and
is bankrupt and Its credit sadly shat
tered. To such an extent is Its credit im
paired that the electric power company.
not being able to collect Its dues, sent a
man to the Marion while the men were
preparing for drill last Tuesday and cut
out all the lights, leaving the Marion in
total darkness.
A Case of irteckless Driving.
Yesterday afternoon Joseph Graf and
Joseph Donnelly hired a horse and buggy
at the Willows stable, on Mission street,
near Seventeenth. On reaching theCorbett
road proceeded to ascertain the animal's
speed. In the attempt the buggy was up
set and the horse injured in such a man
ner that it had to be shot. Both meti were
arrested last evening by Officers Brown
and Connell, on a charge of cruelty to
animals and of fast driving.

In a discussion. He grew excited, and
finally attempted to transfix his antagon
ist with a bayonet, but was overpowered
by two men before he cou'd do any dam
age.

Dr. Bolf was selected by a concert of the three countries which exercise a
protectorate power in the Islands. According to the treaty of ISS9, which gov

before the news came. I do not think that the peaceful diplomatic relations
between Knpland, Germany and the United States will be in any way Bfect

McKinley, Secretary Hay and the German Embassador, and our relations
were most pleasant and aprreeable.

The Pioneer Furniture

City Yesterday.
E MANUEL Emanuel, proprietor of

Pacific avenue. Thirty years ago he
organized the company with his broth

fully conducted It since that time.
For the past two years, however, he
has been Its sole proprietor, his brother
having died in tills city about two
years ago.
Deceased was born In London and
n-as 86 years of ag-e. He has resided
continuously In California for over
fifty years. He was a generous em
ployer and was highly respected by all
who knew him. His many friends are
not confined to this city, for he was
well known and had business association? ' throughout the S'
Emanuel was prominent In Masonic circles and was f ears the
treasurer of Fidelity Lodge, F. and A. M. H* mil all
City Lodge, I. O. O. F., and a member of the American I-fgion of Honor.
His life was marked by his many acts nf rnarity. and he wai com
with a large number of the charitable associations of San Francisco.

resign his honorary memtx o th< r
perquisites secured gratis. Fiut the club is
â  little sum of money Just the

a vigorous excoriation.
It Beems that Stetson owns a small cor
: pasturage ground Rejoining the
Inks, and in laying out a links it
v.-.is fi.und necessary to place the be
on the cow pasture When the
sition was broached the owner
manifested his pleasure and asked only
one thing in returnâ that the club assist
him in getting rid of Klein's odor factory
rhey joyfully agreed, and suit was
ght for an injunction against Klein

rring the matter was compromised
thing less than (1000 and the
slaught. r house removed.
In order to beautify the grounds the

further remunerated by hims-lf and wife

in itself amounting to more than $100
ything Bowed along smoothly until
so. Then the members as
sembled for a practice game and were
Ished to find that Stetson bad built a
ed-wlre fence across bis land and
d a number of cows In the pasture to
feed. Frank Johnson of the Johnson
l,oeke < ompany went to Stetson and Jn
qulred the reason why the fence had been
i there, and was told the land was
ed lor pasture. Fred Green received
nllar reply. It â¢ the act of
â ii was caused by a refusal to cease
employing certain caddies distasteful to
him. All argument failed and the club
has had to reconstruct the course of the
links. a really good course cannot bo
laid out until June l, when the lease of
land adjacent to the links expires.
The members are exceedingly wrathv
over the course of events and express
sorrow that they ever caused Butcher
Klein any trouhi. . The "hoodoo" appear

Of hoi -nai! shoes, caddies on a strike use

MORE TROOPS
FOR MANILA
Fleet of Transports
Will Soon Depart.
THE HANCOCK TO SAIL TO-DAY
BADGER WILL LEAVE FOB
SAMOA NEXT WEEK.
Patrick Kilcoyne Arrested for Smash
ing a Nickel-in-the-Slot Machine
in the New Ferry
Depot.
The United States transports were the
center of attraction on the front yester
day. Crowds were on the front from
early morning until late in the after
noon, but only -i favored few wore al
lowed on the wharves and ships. The
Senator came in from Manila during the
and docked at Broadway In the
morning. She brought three passengers,
! and b< r officers say that she and the
Ohio were ordered to San Francslco In a
hurry. The Ohio is hourly expected, and
both vessels will be prepared to return at
once with troops.
The Grant was to sail from Manila six
days after the Senator, with a crowd of
Invalided soldiers and a number of bodies
for interment in the United States, and
should arrive Tuesday or Wednesday.
The Hancock (Arizona) at Pacific-street
â¢wharf is ready to sail as soon as the
coming soldiers reach this port. The
Twenty-first Regiment of United States
Infantry is expected this morning, and
as .soon as it arrives the men will be
in. ached aboard and the ship Will sail at
high water to-night. In order to have a
cUar wharf for the troops to-day the
loading of the mail steamer Biariposa was
carried on with a rush yesterday.
The v .. 1 S . dia) is at Folsom
i, and will l" 1 ready to sail to-mor
row. M< n were engaged In putting her
new name <>n her bow yesterday, and a
crowd of people watched the proceed
ings all day. She will finish loading to
day, and as Boon a.s the troops assigned
to her arrive she will sail.
The work of loading the Morgan City
and Newport will begin to-day, rhe
: quartermaster department could not han
dle more than the two ships named, but
as they are now practically ready for
Bea work will begin at one-, on the New
port and Morgan City. While these two
- are being fitted out the Senator
and Ohio will go on the dry duck for an
â¢ tn< y are
â  tin r two ships will ho loaded.
Leelanaw is at Main Btreet, and th*Â»
Bidston at the Bea wall. The former is
initig titled to carry a load of mules to
Manila and the latter is now almost
d with supplies for the troops. Al
; most the entire fleet will be away orready
to tail by the time the Grant gets In, bo
the quartermaster will be able to give his
undivided attention to the fitting out of
that vessel. She is 3646 tons burden, or
just a'jout twice the size of the Senator.
The Grant will bo followed by the Sher
man about ten days later, and between
them they will take away nearly three
regiments. It will be the first visit of the
Grant .>>. d Sherman to this port.
The United States auxiliary cruiser
Badger, which arri\>-d from Callao on
Saturday night, went to the Union Iron
Works yesterday. Some try re
pairs must be made to her machinery and,
as ttie navy-yard is rusim-d with work, the
Badger will be attended to here. The or
ders are to have her completed and ready
.i by the 25th inst., *o that to-mor
row week will probably Bee her beading
for Samoa with thy Samoan Commission
ers aboard. She has not been in the dry
dock for a long time, yet she came from
Callao, 4012 miles, in less than fourteen
daj a. When she has been drydocked and
overhauled she should, therefore, reach
Apia, Samoa, 4100 miles, in much bett< r
time and the 7th of May should sen her
anchored alongside of the Philadelphia.
Patrick Kilcoyne, a Baloon-keeper at 58
Bryant street, was locked up m the Har-
Police Station yesterday by Officer
Charles Callaghan on a charge of mali
cious mischief. Patrick left his .saloon
about noon in the care of the bark
and started on a trip to Oakl.-uid. On
ng the ferry depot ho made his way
to the upper waiting room and there espied
a nlckel-ln-tht-siot weighing machine.
Now, this particular machine, like many
another of Its kind, happened to be out of
order, but Pat was not aware of the fact.
lie got on the weighing table and, after a
few seconds' pause to steely the ma
chine, he dropped in a nickel. The mdi:
-: did not move and Pat swore softly
to himself. Then another nickel was
dropped in and still the machine would
not weigh and Patrick cursed the South
ern Pacific and all kindred monopolies
that Bet up nickel-in-the-slot machines to
rob th* guileless public. Then he
dropped in a tliird nickel and loht all pa
tience. Standing near Kilcoyne was one
of the janitors in the ferry depot.
"The thing is out of order,' 1 said be,
"and all it does is rob people. It ought
to be smashed."
The idea struck Kilcoyne as an excel
lent one and he proceeded to put it into
itlon. !!â¢â  Ufted the machine bodily
and threw it with a crash on the floor.
Women waiting for the ferryboat ncrcatn
i.l ;i;.il made a rush for the door. That
<!i(i not stop Kilcoyne, however, and he did
not leave the Plot machine until It was a
wreck. By that time Officer Callaghan,
was on the scene and at once placed Kil
â  und< r i i rest.
it -re were two narrow escapes from
drowning on the front yesterday. A
young fellow named George Tobin was
rescued by Frank Kenealy at Howard
street wharf and a boy named Teddy
Rodgers was saved by Harry Johnson at
Folsom-street wharf. The ship St.
Nicholas w;is docking at Howard street
and Tobin was taking her lines. After
making the headline fast he was stand-
Ing near it. The ship went astern and
as the line tightened It caught around
Tobin's leg and pulled him into the bay.
Kenealy happened to be standing on the
wharf, and. seeing Tobin's peril, threw
him a heaving line and got him ashore.
Teddj Rodgers nearly lost his life from
the Folsom-street float. He was watch-
Ing the xiassengers for the lowa get
aboard the launch William D and stood
with one foot on the launch and one on
the float. The launch moved out of the
slip and Teddy fell Into the bay. He
grabbed the side of the launch and was
towed out some distance before he let go.
Hp> could not swim and was going down
for the last time when Harry Johnson
plunged In and brought him ashore more
dead than alive. The youngster was
taken to the Harbor Receiving Hospital
nnd relieved of the water he had swal
lowed and th*>n sent home.
The ferry steamer Berkeley was In
trouble again yesterday. When making a
landing on this side at 1:20 p. m. yester
day she got caught In the tide rip and
went sideways into her slip. She jammed
there and It was nearly a quarter of an
hour before she could be moved. In the
meantime her passengers had to wait and
the Newark was forced to drift around in
the bay, awaiting her turn to dock. The
Berkeley was finally straightened out and
got away on her 1:30 p. m. trip, after
which the Newark docked and landed her
passengers.

A CHOIR BOY'S
FEARFUL FALL
ALBERT FATyTTC. a 10-year-old choir boy in St. Luke's -Church. Van Ness
avenue and Clay street, met with an accident yesterday morning that
may prove fatal.
He hart gone to Sunday school in the morning, and while waiting till
church opened he and some other boys went to the new structure in course, of
erection, the gates being kept open Sundays to allow parishioners to see how
the work is proceeding. The boys grot to the second floor, fronting V:in Ness
avenue, where two elevators used for hoisting mortar and material were
standing. Falck got onto one of the elevators and w;is, it is thought, trying to
step from one to the other when he missed his footing and fell to the bottom,
a distance of about thirty feet.
The boy struck on some loose planks In the basement at the bottom of
the elevator shafts and was picked up unconscious and carried to the first
floor. A message was sent to the North End police station and the uncon
scious boy was taken to the Receiving Hospital in the patrol wagon. Dr.
Well found that he was suffering from concussion of the brain and possible
internal Injuries. He recovered consciousness for a few minutes yesterday
afternoon and recognized his sister, who is a physician, and again lapsed
into unconsciousness.
His father, Bernharri Fnlck, and his sister remained at his bedside all day
and night yesterday. It is thought that his skull is fractured.

TWO YOUNGSTERS
SEVERELY INJURED
PAINFUL ACCIDENTS AT THE
PARK PLAYGROUND.
Sally's Body Lying in. State ac the
Chutes â Interesting Aqur.tic Pro
gramme at Sutro Baths.
Youngsters by thfÂ» thousand thronged
the playground In the^ I'ark yesterday. It
bi eemed as though some special event was
the cause of the gathering of the hosis of
children, and matters were made to savor
even more of a sp.cial event gathering by
a couple of accidents in which as many
children were severely Injured.
George Herbert, who resides a.t Sol Pine
street, was the first to l>e taken to the
emergency hospital for treatment. Mas
ter Herbert, who has seen about seven an
nual school vacations, was performing on
fine of the merry-go-round horses, it is
said. Finally he lost his balance, and was
thrown heavily on the wooden platform.
The amhulance was summoned, he was
taken to the hospital, and it was found
that he had sustained a fracture of both
bones of the left arm near the wrist.. The.
injured member was set, after which the
lad was taken to his home.
Alice Tennis, who lives with her parents
at 178 Noe Btreet, was next treated at the
hospital. Miss Tennis was enjoying her
self in a swing when in some way she he
ram- entangled In its working parts and
her right leg was fractured below the
knee. Her ankle was also severely
lammed. After her hurts had been at
tended to she was removed to her home.
This ended the day's list of severe in
juries, although several suffered scratches
"and bruises from minor accidents, while
one woman fell from her horse and nar
rowly escaped receiving a broken arm.
She mounted her animnl, however, and
rode off, refusing the assistance of a po
liceman, who went to her aid.
At the Chutes there Is mourning. Sally,
the Intellectual little chimpanzee, passed
away last Friday of hemorrhage of the
stomach, superinduced by a seven- ease
of bronchitis, which caused the animal In
cessant coughing. Sally's body Is now
lying in state In the zoo. Dressed in im
maculate white, the body does not look
unlike that of a child or tender years
barring the whiskersâ as it reposes In a
tiny white casket. Beside the body Congo.

JOSHUA R. RINES LAID
TO HIS FINAL REST
Last Honors to the
Veteran Letter-
Carrier.
THK funeral of the veteran letter
carrier, Joshua R. Rines. who
died rather suddenly last Tues
day nlgrht, was hold yesterday
afternoon under the Joint aus
pices of the letter carriers and
the Odd Fellows. The brief services
at the house were conducted by the
letter Carriers' Mutual Aid Associa
tion at 12:30, and then the remains
were placed In a hearse and escorted
to Odd Fellows' Hall by fully three
hundred mail carriers, headed by the
better Carriers' Band. Here services
wore held by the Odd Fellows, after
which the procession was again
formed and the remains escorted to
Fourteenth street, where the funeral train was in waiting to convey the
body and the mourners to Cypress Lawn, where the Interment took
place. The floral offerings were many and beautiful and attested the es
teem in which the dead carrier was held by his associates. Among the more
elaborate floral pieces were: "His Last Letter" from the clerks of Sta
tion D, a magnificent creation surmounted by a letter and with a mail
satchel at its base from the carriers of Station D, and a shield and chair
from the Letter Carriers' Mutual Aid Association and the Independent Be
nevolent Association respectively. Abraham Lincoln Council, Junior Order
of American Mechanics, sent a letter to the widow, sympathizing with her
in her bereavement. John Rines, eldest brother of the deceased, and his
wife, of Seattle, attended the funeral.
Joshua R. Rines was the veteran letter carrier of the Pacific coast and
the last of the original seventeen carriers appointed to deliver Uncle Sam's
mail in San Francisco In 1869. He was born in Maltland, N. S., In 1834. and
and came to California by way of Cape Horn' in 1868, locating at Marys
ville. While firing a Fourth of July salute in 18G1 he lost an arm. Tn 1868
he removed to San Francisco, and four years later, on November 15, 1569, he
was appointed to deliver the mail by General Copy. Since that time he
had been absent from the city but three days in his almost thirty years of
service. In 1883 Mr. Rines began the agitation that resulted in the forma
tion of the Letter Carriers' Mutual Aid Society and was its first treasurer,
being four times re-elected to that position. He was president of the In
dependent Benevolent Association at the time of his death. He was a
brother of Dr. C. H. Rines of this city. One sister resides in the East, and
his mother, now In her 93d year, three sisters and a brother reside in the
State of Washington. Deceased left a widow but no children.
