A
CAR
NIVAL OF
NOISE USHERS
IN THE NEW YEAR
THAT hilarious joy which finds
vent only through the medium of
a tin horn became epidemic In
San Francisco last night, and the
result was that for six hours
thousands of otherwise respectable
citizens of all ages, sexes and condi
tions were seriously at work trying to
convince themselves in particular and
the world in general that they were
having a real good time.
In the early hours of the evening the
peripetatic vender of noise machines
held sway and was the sole peace dis
turber, but gradually bis persistent
blowing exercised a hypnotic control
over the pedestrians, and those who
had come downtown to see and hear re
mained to be seen and heard, and their
numbers increased to such an extent
that by 10 o'clock Market street pre
sented the appearance of being occu
pied by a cross between a Mongolian
wedding and an Indian funeral.
N-W Year's eve in San Francisco
Hair to be unique, which distinction
is arrived at through the peculiar and
varied noises with which the citizens
attest their fulsome gladness over the
expiration of another period of 365
days of doing something or somebody.
This New Year's eve achieved the dis
tinction of having a new noise. Our
closer relations .Vlth oriental countries
have evidently brought a bizarre as
sortment of musical instruments of the
five-keyed variety and these were
pressed Into service to enable cele
brants to maintain the city's reputation
In this particular.

but when the wielders of these instru- \
ments of nerve torture slackened in
their enthusiasm the melody of Chi
nese flutes, gongs, cowbells, Japanese
rattles, drumsâ any old thing that
Will produce soundâ burst forth in its
full glory.
These variations In the symphony,
however, were few and far between, for
if there is any one thing which does not
tire the average San Franciscan on
New Year's ... it is blowing a tin
horn. It Is his special vocation and
he tills It in a manner that would be
perfectly satisfactory to the leader of
the orchestra In a Chinese theater. In
fact when it comes to proving the ex
uberance of joyousness by making a
noise that contains no music all China
town must hang Its diminished head in
the presence of last night's New Year's
eve crowd on the 'streets of San Fran
cisco.
As the evening waned and the new
year approached the fun became fast
and furious and the noise increased

whole city had resolved itself. into
one vast voice that persisted in pro
claiming to the world that something

New Year's eve in San Francisco
many of them celebrated just, as was
this one. But it is the opinion of a
perfectly unbiased onlooker who has
reached the stage of life where all is
vanity and vexation of spirit that the
celebration last night outshone, by sev
eral points, all preceding ones.
Kbration last night outshone, confined
points, all preceding ones.
p to _O:SQ the crown was confined
to the sidewalks and was distinguish
able from the ordinary Saturday nigh
crowd on the street by the volume of
sound which accompanied it. It rapid
ly increased, however, as the side
streets emptied themselves the ihe
â  1 themselves into ih
main thoroughfare and the new asphalt
pavement was soon crowded to the car
tracks with the pushing, jostling,
struggling throng, all intent upon doing
something that would bring distinction
and consequent joy to the individual?
Then to the din, which by this time had
reached a point that drove strong men
to the nearest saloons for nerve medi
cine, was added the constant ringing
of the bells of the cable cars", as the
gripmen endeavored to force their way
through the" heedless mass of excite
ment-crazed human beings.
Up and down the street surged the
crowd, good humored and merry ex
cept on rare ocaslons, when some gang
of hoodlums would overstep the bounds
of patience and receive merited punish
ment. Everybody was bent on having
fun at the expense of others only so far
as it meant the sudden blowing of a
horn or shrill shriek of a whistle in the
nearest ear. This sort of amusement
was well received, but whenever over
exuberance induced one of the revelers
to go beyond what was recognized as
legitimate fun the entire crowd hunted
out the misguided one and made him
sorry that he was alive.
On ordinary occasions boisterousness
is supposed to be the especial preroga
tive of the male sox (but by long ac
cepted custom the hilarity of New
Year's eve in San Francisco has been
about evenly divided between the en
tire human family and last night was
no exception to the rule. Thousands of
â women and girls made up for the other
364 days when they have to keep silent

expected to remain cozily in some con

venient doorway, soon found them
selves swept along with the living
stream, and before they knew how or
when became possessed with a trn-horn
and a maddening desire to blow it.
And blow it they did. some with hats
awry and faces red, others in a demure
and shame-faced manner, but all with
a look of exaltation on their counte
nances that possibly made up. for many
days of domestic quiet.
Young girls and old girls whose ages
ranged from under 10 to over
well, over the ages where they
cease to be girlsâ went
along in the proud con
sciousness that, they
were just as big
boys as their
brothers,

after their annual dissipa

fashions last night. ;
â¢ Portly old gentlemen with patri
archial beard.- and dressed in a styiw
that suggested the affluent heads of
large families marched along with silk
hats resting easily on the backs of their
heads, while their gloved hands held the
omnipresent tin horn to their lips as
they blew with all the joyous gladness
of their youngest grandchild.
So it went up and down,' back and
across the great commercial artery of
the city until the hands on the clocks
approached the mystic hour when
graveyards are supposed to yawn and
ghosts to walk. If that grewsome habit
had been practiced last night the in
habitants of the other world . would
probably have reached the conclusion
that the Angel Gabriel had been multi
plied many fold and was announcing
the -last day. Just as the hands reached
the top of the dial, together, what an
hour earlier seemed to be the ' .ipossible
was achieved. I There was such an ac

fell on the air until it seemed as if the
all-pervading sound had substance and
were powerful enough to crush in the
massive buildings which lined the
street.
With the passing of the hour came
comparative quiet and then followed
soberness and the dense crowd melted
away, each Individual undoubtedly
satisfied that he or she had done their
full duty and had let off enough sur
plus energy to prevent the violation of
more serious laws for another twelve
months to come.

Senator Morehouse added:
"Nothing less than an affidavit signed
3y George "W. Bakerâ a signed and
sworn statement containing an abso
lute denial of the charge in every par
ticular would induce me to? withhold
demand for instant inquiry. If it be
true, as Mr; Baker Is' reported to have
said, that 5500 was paid to men in the
Senate to pass bill 273, it is due to the
people of the State to know , to whom
the money was paid and by whom it
was supplied. If Mr. Baker used money
to influence the votes of men in the
Senate he is guilty of a felony and
should be punished. There are twenty
hold-over Senators, and others who
were not hold-overs have been -..re
elected. The bill could not have passed
unless some of these Senators voted for
it. The charge therefore applies to
men now holding seats in the Senate
and cannot be set aside as 'applying
only to those who served in the Legis
lature two years ago.

and the editor of the Examiner, who
asserts that the charge is well founded,
to appear before the committee and
answer questions bearing upon the sub

"I shall move at the earliest oppor

it he should be made to tell" how, when

â¢Captain Corley made
a caustic speech in which
he referred to Burns as an
"ex-convict," a "man with
out morals" and a "man whose
public record Is such that if
elected Senator he can never, se
cure any needed opproprlation for
the Pacific Coast, simply because of
distrust of his colleagues." There
was nothing but a quiet murmur of
approval at this, showing that the
committee might think it inadvisable to
ask the Assemblyman and Senator of
the district not to vote for Burns, but
that so far as his candidacy is con
cerned they are opposed to it for strong
reasons.; â  \ ". /
The attitude of Chairman Pryor was
discussed after the session with con
siderable acerbity, it being alleged that
before the meeting he told several mem
bers Captain Gorley was to introduce a
resolution condemning Burns' candi
dacy, asking- them to vote for the
adoption of such resolution, but after
the meeting asserted that he would not
have had it adopted "for a thousand

but on account of the non-arrival of
many legislators who were expected
on the evening trains the proposed joint
meeting was postponed until to-mor

There is also an expressed, desire on
the part of these same Senatorial can
didates to bring about permanent or
ganization of the Legislature on the
opening day. If -*â *â¢â â¢Â« Is done the elec

have to be held a week from Tuesday.
This would prevent* the possibility of

If permanent organization Is delayed

would give the Burns forces time in

An effort was made last evening by
some of the members from th*e south
to secure a caucus on the proposition
of the distribution of patronage. An
agreement was reached that a meeting
be held at 10 o'clock to-morrow morn

The friends of El Alcalde, who are
here to-night, claim for him enoueh

at the caucus of to-morrow eveniner.

at that. Milton Green. Tom Nosier

ation of $250,000 to be expended in har
bor movements. 7;-7
Those of the San Francisco delegation
who have already Invaded the capital
seem to be wondering why they came
so early. Until some head to direct
them gets here they are apparently
quite at sea as to what they are expect
ed to do. Leon Dennery came up to
night and is taking as active a hand
In coming legislative affairs as though
he were already seated. He makes no
secret of the fact that he expects to
occupy the seat in the Senate to which
R. Porter Ashe was elected.
Several of the Alameda County dele
gation are here, but few of them know
"where they are at," on the Senatorial
fight or any other proposition. * For the
banner Republican county. Alameda is
exceedingly modest in her demands for
legislative patronage.
Lou Martin of Oakland is making an
active canvass for sergeant at arms
of the Senate and expects to win out
with little or no trouble.
J. C. Sorror of Elmhurst wants â¢ a
clerkship â one with an adequate
salary will do and he does not see how
he can fail to land something. Both of
these men have the backing of their
delegation and as those are about the
only places Alameda asks for aside
from the speakership, they bid fair to
win out. - â¢ "
Jim Oliver of Berkeley, who hopes to
be the next Deputy Labor Commis
sioner and says he has no reason to be

an advisory capacity to the Alamedans.
Oliver says his right is so well in hand
now that there is no necessity for him
to hold on to the anxious Beat any

q :^' : CALL HEADQUARTERS, 'SACRAMENTO, Dee. 31.â The Bulla men from South- Â°
O em California have been unusually active and confident to-day and are apparently really anx- Q
Â° ious and desirous that, the balloting should commence.,. q
0 . Assemblyman L. H. Valentine has been here for some days presenting the claims of ***--
O Los Angeles County's favorite son with great vigor and earnestness. Mr. Valentine figures that q
O at a minimum calculation Senator Bulla will have twentyr-two votes on the first ballot. Another Â©
Â® point Assemblyman Valentine urges strongly in favor of Bulla is the character of the members Â°
0 of the Assembly and Senate who are lending their votes to Bulla's canvass. A majority of 9
O them have already served one term in the State Legislature absolutely without any reflection o
Â® upon their character as to measures either fathered or voted for. O
O * Senator Currier will, it is understood, arrive from Los Angeles to-morrow and add the 0
Â° strength of his personality to the already strong column Senator Bulla has in the field here. O
Senator Currier is an old and experienced politician, having figured in Los Angeles County Â°
O politics for years and having served a term there .as Sheriff. He is very enthusiastic in his sup- 5
Â° port of Bulla and will be able to do a great deal before the final ballot is taken. q
â Â® * Before the Bulla men left Los Angeles it was agreed among them that they should re- Â°
q main firm and true to their favorite to the very last. Upon this subject they are agreed as a 5?
O unit, and all talk or gossip to the contrary is idle. o
0 In Southern California the Grant men, under the able manipulation of "Weeping" q
O James Kelley, have endeavored to create the impression that the Bulla men were largely in O
Â© the Senatorial struggle in the interest and for the advancement of the candidacy of D. M. Â°
Â° Burns. "Weeping" James and his coadjutors certainly distributed stories to this effect with Â©
O great skill, and they were assisted by Brigadier General H. G.Otis' newspaper, the Los An- O
O geles Times, which journal is strongly urging the Grant claims. ,Â®
J But these statements are folly. Senator Bulla is a candidate in good faith, and his sup- o
q porters announce unqualifiedly that they will remain firm and true to him to the last. Â°
O p As far as Grant's legislative vote south of Tehachapi is concerned, he has, as first choice, o
Â® made no gains. San Diego County he has solid, and possibly three more scattering votes in Â°
O Orange and Riverside counties. All that the prestige of a great* name, strong political press- o
O ure and the assistance of a number of prominent men from the outside could effect has been O
Z. done in the interest of Grant in Southern California. Â©
Â© o
O There are two dark horses in the Senatorial field from the south, who as yet have no o

'Â° than a few newspaper notices the world may never know that in this year of our Lord 1898 Â°
O they longed for the honors of the United States Senatorship. â â â .' J?

Legislators Apprehensive Over the Lack of Printing

CALL HEADQUARTERS, ; SACRA- i
MENTO, Dec. 31.â Some of the more
experienced legislators who arrived,
here to-day are much troubled on ac
count of the situation as regards the
State Printing Office. They incline to
the belief that the Legislature will be
unable to transact any business after
organizing until Governor-elect Gage
has been inaugurated.
None of the preliminary legislative
printing has been done, the printing
office having been closed since the be
ginning of the last fiscal year on ac
count of lack of funds. No printing
can be done until the present Legisla
ture makes an appropriation to meet
the expenses. If such an appropriation
bill were rushed . through on the first

man of the Republican County Central
Committee of Madera County i /}
Resolved by the Madera Repub- -
lican Central Committee assembled !
in Madera this 31st day of Decern- '
ber, 1898, that we, as members of -
the Republican party of the State of ;)
California, are opposed in every I

considered extremely doubtful whether
or not It would be signed by Governor
Budd. 'yyy
Early In December an effort was
made to reopen the State printing office
and the purpose would have been ac
complished had it not been for the ob
jection made by certain legislators who
opposed Governor Bu 14 at the time he
vetoed the printing office appropriation
two years ago.
About three weeks ago Governor
Budd, Secretary of State Brown, and
Attorney General Fitzgerald signed an
authorization directing State Printer
Johnston to incur such expenses as
were necessary to perform the work of
doing the printing needed for the ooen
ing days of the Legislature, the Inten
tion being to pay for the same from
the funds of the State under the act
of 1893. Instead of going ahead with
the work, Johnston took counsel of the
party leaders and the doors of the
State printing office remained closed.
HAPPY NEW YEAR
To all our friends and patrons. May health and prosperity be your por-
tion for 1899- "We are closed to-day, of course,' and also to-morrow (Monday,
â¢ January 2) as it is kept as a legal holiday. On Tuesday, the 3rd, we start
our sales"for the year, which we have reason to believe will be the most
prosperous we have experienced since 1892-not only for our house and
the mercantile trade generally, but for the whole people of the whole coun-
try collectively. We have waited long for the- prosperity which protection
and continued peace always brings. Now with proper individual effort and
careful management of expenses, let all look forward with confidence to that
comfort which is the reward of patient toil.

It was argued that Governor Budd.
having taken it upon himself to veto
the printing office appropriation made
by the last Legislature, should now. be
made to suffer the consequences of his
act by being. held up before the people
of the State as the person responsible
for delaying the work of the present
Legislature. '.*/?:
All of the reports of commissions and.
State institutions must be printed be
fore they can be given legislative con
sideration. There is such a quantity of
this kind of work that the Printing
Office will be so choked for a month
after funds are provided for its main
tenance that it will be impossible to
print the bills introduced In the Legis
lature with the degree of expedition
necessary to allow for completing the
work of the session within sixty days.
The printing of the report of the Cede
Commission alone will require the labor
of the entire force of the State Printing
Office for at least three weeks.
It Is very evident that there is good
reason for the alarm shown by the
| older members on the ground to-day.
| It is not impossible that the Legislature
will be so crippled by the condition of
affairs in the State Printing Office that
the calling of an extra session will be
necessary. Many of the members de
clare they will return to their homes as
soon as their pay ceases, and the call
ing of an extra session would be the
only means of keeping them at the
capitoi.
While the persons responsible for the
present deplorable condition of affairs
are "doing" petty politics for the pur
pose of evening up personal differences,
the dear taxpayers of the State are fac
ing the probability of having to foot a
pretty bill of extras, to say nothing of
the certainty of the miscarriage of leg
islation that is of vital importance to
the State.

THE law safeguards the inviolability
of letters sent through the malls.
Their seal may not even be broken
to further the ends of justice, ex
cept In the manner which the courts have
determined, and ln respect for private
rights. The law, in a I ing line of stat
utes and decisions, has thrown protection
around communication by telegraph. The
rights of sender and receiver are defined
and trespass upon them is at the peril of
the trespasser. The tapping of telegraph
wires to secure illicit possession of the
messages they carry, for the benefit of
ether than the person sending and the one
receiving them. is made a felony, and is
punished penally. The Interests of so
ciety and civilization are now so depend
ent upon modern methods of inter-com
munication, the mail, th- telegraph and
the telephone, that any violation of the
trust assumed by either method is an
offense, not only ln Itself, but by supply
ing facility for other offenses, makes the
one guilty of it a possible accessory to a
wide range and great variety of crimes.
If it were needful that the law protect
the privacy of letters and of telegrams
and of the telegraph wires, which offer
peculiar facilities for tapping by the Im
possibility of guarding them on the des
erts, mountains and lonely reaches over
which they stretch, there Is much more
necessity that the law stand guard over
the telephone.
It is In use in millions of homes for com
munication between members of the fam
ily, and in that relation carries every day
messages of domestic confidence, many
of which disclosed would throw society
into a turmoil. It is used in confidential
communication and between business men
and their correspondents, agents and cus
tomers. It Is profitably employed by the
daily press in gathering news, in sending
orders to reporters and correspondents for
exclusive Information, the inviolate own
ership of which Is a valuable considera
tion to a newspaper. So universal has be
come the employment of the telephone
and' so general is the public confidence in
the privacy of Its use that It Is safe to
say that violation of that privacy is a
more serious offense than the opening of
letters unlawfully or the tapping of tele
graph wires. Telegrams can be sent in
cipher and letters can be written in cryp
tograms. But people do not talk in cipher.
Communication by telephone is carried on
as freely as though the parties stood face
to face.
The possibility of a leak in the tele
phone carries disquiet and consternation
Into every home, public office and busi
ness establishment where the use of that
instrument has become a necessity. A
telephone company is an important" trus
tee of the whole community patronizing
it, and a violation of that trust is an of
fense of such aggravate,! criminality as to
require the most drastic reprisals.
Through^ being made the victim of
such betrayal of this trust The Call has
been led to use. the means or demonstrat
ing that the administration of the tele
phone company in San Francisco is cor
rupt to the core and Its service a gigantic
â¢py system and organized betrayal of Its
customers for the benefit of their social,
political, amatory, official <r business
enemies or rivals, who are will'ng to pay
the price of the treachery and' violation
of privacy.
The first offense which attracted the at
tention of this office was committed by
an employe of the telephone company at
Sausalito. A Call reporter had sent in
exclusive information of the attempted
murder on vie Cbispa, and immediately
the telephone operator repeated it to the
Examiner correspondent. On Investiga
tion the operator admitted this offense
and was discharged. This incident caused
a quiet and searching investigation into
the methods of the Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph Company and its subordinate
corporation, the Sunset Telephone and
Telegraph Company. The former
handles the local business of San Fran
cisco, the latter all out of town business.
The result of this investigation will
: startle the community and spread abroad
I a feeling of distrust and unsafety. Sev
eral sporadic leaks were found, but on
! chasing them down they were found to
|be no parts of the main system. They
' consisted in the results of chummy gossip
between an occasional woman reporter
and some of the telephone girls. In fol
lowing them up it was discovered, how
ever, that there was a regular system of
leakage, as extensive as any one wished
to have it who was willing to "put up."
At last it was found to be in the Exam
iner oflice. An employe of that paper de
vised It, and when l.c had it In working
order was instructed to go on and per
fect it. For that purpose he was sup
j plied with theater tickets, money for sup
â  pers and entertainments. His work was
j to secure control of the operators and
I convert the switchboard into an adjunct
|of the Examiner office. His newspaper
| work consisted in sitting with a telephone
| to his ear and listening to messages which
were leaked oh to his wire by simply
bringing its "plug" into contact with the
; wire ilia* he wished to tap. In this way
news reports to the other papers were
Stolen, private conversations between
business men, politicians, public officers,
men and women, husbands and wives,
j have been taken off, written down and
; kept In the Examiner office for use in the
j kind of journalism practiced there.
A prominent State official had a conver
; sation over the Sunset wire with the
I Warden of Bad Quentin relative to Dur
rant while that noted prisoner was there.
Each official was alone at his end of the
wire. But the operator at the switchboard
leaked every word onto the Examiner
wire and the conversation appeared ln
that paper next day.
The public recalls the difficulty en
countered in the final disposition of Dur
rants body. The undertaker in charge
of it received a Sunset message from the
Pasadena crematory that It would be re
ceived there and inclntrated. Within five
minutes an Examiner reporter was at his
office asking when the b<,dv would be sent
to Pasadena, and when) the undertaker

slow action of the pot for melting the
stereotype metal. The time lost In this
eavesdropping let the Examiner pressman
get away, so that no extra could issue
from that office.
Extending the examination The Call
found that three decoy conversations he,d
between the Call office and different peo
ple were accurately leaked on to the
wire held by the Inventor of the Exam
iner's method of violating the confidence
and betraying the trust put in the Pacwic
Telephone and Telegraph Company.
It was found that messages over the
wires of that company, were as much at
the disposal of an enemy or rival of the
sender or the receiver as if they were
shouted from the housetops or posted on
the public billboards.
It was found that the instruction given
to the operators who handle the out of
town business over the Sunset wires is
to take down verbatim every conversation
held over those wires, and that every con
versation is transcribed, indexed and pre
served in the telephone office. The com
pany cannot plead that this is for the
purpose of determining the fee due from
the sender of the conversation for use of
the wire, because the rate is fixed by tne
time occupied and not by the number cd",
words used.
This Is a portentous record when one re
flects that it is Indexed and in the posses
sion of a corporation which puts the'mes
sages sent over its wires at the service
of any one who wants them plugged to
his phone. It is disquieting to thousands
to know that the, switchboard of the cor
poration is as public and open to buy
ers who have no right to what they get
as the meat block of a butcher's stall In
the California Market. It is alarming
that any and every message is subject to
leakage and that there is no privacy nor
confidence possible, and that this is not
the result of accident, of induction of cur
rents or chance contact of wires, but of
a regular system devised and hourly car
ried out by the employes of the company
and under the noses of Its officers.
Many patrons, of this telephone com
pany, out of abundant caution, have pri
vate wires and phones, and to make se
curity doubly sure some have these un
der assumed names, for the purpose of
complete seclusion from their business or
official cares, and yet controlling such
communication as they wish. But The
Call Is prepared to show that ln no case
are these devices proof against the Ex
aminer's invention of this graft. How do
Mayor Phelan, Governor Budd and other
prominent officials like to know that they
have not had privacy for a single message
they have ever sent under the supposed
security of these wires and pseudonyms?

Lieutenant Price Laid Up.
Lieutenant William Price of the Seven
teenth street police station, who had re
cently been appointed by the Chief of
Police to take charge of the unruly Chi
namen in the Mongolian section of the
city, is laid up at his residence with a se
vere cold, which he contracted in driv
ing the highbinders, cutthroats and all
round thugs into, the sewers of China
town.
Since Price was assigned to the China
section he has labored day and night in
the discharge of his duties until at the
time he was taken ill he had succeedd
in driving every blackleg out Of the Chi
nese strongholds, and the entire section
had become as peaceful as though there
never was a drop of human blOod shed
by the wielding of a Mongolian hatchet.
Price is looked upon by the Chinese out
laws as the only man on the police force
who is not afraid to wade right into their
strongholds and scatter them. He has
overtaxed his strength and through want
of sleep he had to take to his bed a few
days ago and temporarily * give up his
work. 7: . .-. y'y.yiy: '*"'-â .. / â

To-day has been one of preparation
on both sides. Everything moved
smoothly and evacuation has been car
ried out in strict accordance with the
promise of the Spanish commission.
All Spanish troops are aboard the
transports except the Tenth Engineers,
who remain ashore to Rive Spain's

be turned over to the American au- |
thorities at noon, the arsenal, naval
station, custom house and the building
occupied by the port officers and Ma

General Butler, who has just returned \
from a visit to Clenfuegos and interme- j
diate points, reports an improvement In i
social conditions and disposition among
all classes to accept whatever form of
government the United States will give
Cuba. There are about 40,000 Spanish

TC PEOPLE OF CUB'
HAVANA, Dec. 31.â proclamation

It is as follows:
"Coming among you as the repre

to carry these objects through the
channels of civil administration, al
though under military control.

BROOKE WILL HAVE
A SPECIAL CABINET
WASHINGTON, PÂ«q- 21.â The War
Department has come to the conclusion
that it will be necessary to accord Gen
eral Brooke, Military Governor of Cuba,
; the assistance of a special Cabinet ap
j proaching in functions the late autono
j mist Cabinet of Cuba, In the adminis-
I tration of the civil affairs of the Is
i land.
CUBANS SORE AND IN
A DISTRUSTFUL MOOD
HAVANA, Dec. 31.â The position of
the military administration in request
ing the Cubans not to make any
; demonstration to-morrow upon the oc
casion of the turning over of the gov
ernment to the United States was pri
vately advised by several notable Cv
â¢ bans, whose names are not made pub
j lie In order to protect them from the
I wrath of their people. - The prohibition
would have been issued even if this ad
vice had not been given. Nevertheless
the fact that It was given shows that
the judgment of General Brooke and
General Ludlow is sustained by expert
: judges of Cuban character and feeling.
More Cuban flags were taken in to
day. The invitation of the Americans
to Cuban ladies and gentlemen to wit
ness the scenes at the palace has been
declined with the explanation that the
recipients of the invitation do not In
tend to leave their houses to-morrow.
Some dwellings may appear draped In
black.
The smaller papers criticize the
American policy with touches of bitter
ness, but the larger dailies take no de
cided stand.
Printed anonymous handbills are in
circulation, satirically advising the Cu
| bans to "never mind," as they could
; have a good time cheering the Amer
i icans. The change of flags Is likened
in these handbills to a wedding, re
garding which the kinspeople and
friends of the bride are told that the
marriage will take place to-night, but
that they can celebrate the event a
month hence.
The city is quiet to-night, as it has
been for two days. Encounters of in
dividuals In heated political discussions,
such as occur in any American city of
200,000 inhabitants, are not considered
indicative of more riotous mood. Most
of the Cubans are grieved and distrust
ful regarding the ultimate purpose of
the United States, rather than angered.
Company C of the Fourth Virginia
Regiment is camped upon the Glacis
at the Cabanas fortress and Morro
Cattle. A few Spanish artillerists are
Inside. The Spanish infantrymen in the
city have been withdrawn to a space
covering six blocks, embracing the Cab
balora block, the palace, the residence
of the military governor and the near
by barracks for a few hundred soldiers.
The embarkation of these troops aboard
the transports Chateau la Fitte and
Stuttgart , will take place before 10
| o'clock to-morrow morning, leaving
I Captain General Castellanos and his
j staff of fifteen under the protection of
I Americans.
The sound of hammers is hoard In
| the palace, nailing up boxes containing
: the papers, books and effects of the cap
tain general. The corridors and offices
are strewn with waste paper and use
less trifles.
Colonel Bacallao, chief of staff of
General Ruls Rivera, who has been
confined for a long time, was released
to-day. He looks comely and in good
health. He says that he has been well
treated recently, but that he had a ter
rible time during his imprisonment in
the Cabanas fortress, where he was
confined in a wet, nasty cell. He will
request the American authorities to
try him on the charge of murder in or
der to clear his name. He was released
upon his own recognizance.
General Davis came to Havana from
Pinar del Rio to-day to confer with
General Brooke. He says the province
is peaceful, but asks for another regi
ment to patrol and garrison the remote
parts of the province.
Senator John W. Daniel of Virginia
arrived to-day on the steamer Mas
col
The Spanish royal march was played
this afternoon in the camps of General
Lee's troops.
The band of the Second Illinois has
been selected to play at the palace to
morrow. The band had never played
the royal march before to-day and It
practiced the air four hours. It will
also play the "Star Spangled Banner,"
as the American flag is raised.

test In the hope of drawing some of the
Burrows strength has not been success
ful, and It now appears that the fight will
be practically between Burrows; who is
known as the Federal candidate,. and
Pack, the Pingree candidate, with .the
odds in the way of pledged votes in favor
of the Senator succeeding himself for the
full six years' term. The Democrats
have brought out no candidate.

CONSPIRACY OF THE ARMY
DETERMINED TO PLACE NAPO
LEON ON THE THRONE.
If the Civil Authorities Prevent
Dreyfus From Being Liberated

May Be Averted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
' LONDON, Dec. 31.â The rumor that
Prince Victor Napoleon had resigned
his claims in favor of his brother,
Prince Louis, who, by the way, is about
to be created a general in the Russian
army, turns out to be inaccurate. It
is round the person of the former that
dynastic conspiracy has grown to Its
present vast proportions and immi
nence, for it is how certain that the In
tention of the chiefs of the French army
is to place a Napoleon again upon the
throne of France and very soon.
I fully realize the gravity of this
statement, but I make it upon infor
mation which would convince the most
skeptical if I were at liberty to publish
it. I say this is their intention, a fixed,
determined, passionate intention, but
it is easy to understand that In so ex
tremely ticklish an undertaking some
thing may occur to break their wheels.
For example, the French civil authori
ties may take their courage in both
hands and denounce the danger to the
whole people and make a public appeal
to the army before the military con
spirators can do so.
In that case the army would proba
bly rally to the republic in such pro
portion as to render military appeal ob
viously futile beforehand. Or the civil
authorities may convince the Court! of
Cassation that the release of Dreyfus
or the pronouncement of his innocence
would result in the overthrow of the
republic the next day, in which case it
Is . conceivable that even the highest
judges in France would feel compelled
to choose the lesser of two such gigan
tic evils. But unless some such coun
sel of despair prevails you may look
for another French revolution within a
period to be measured by days. â¢//

THE STRUGGLE.
Woman Who Figures in the Los An
geles Tragedy Claims the Dy
ing Man Is Her Law
ful Husband.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 31.â The fact is
established that the mortal wounding of
Chief Deputy City Engineer George B.
King last night, by Theresa Kerr, was
an accident. Between sobs the woman
.to-night told the story of the tragedy.
The evidence would indicate that the
unfortunate woman sought to make
away with herself and* sacrifice her life
that the man she loved might be free.
Attorney Frank Davis was to-night
engaged to defend the woman. Al
though the greatest secrecy . is being
maintained, it is learned from an au
thoritative source what the woman's de
fense will be. It will be sought to prove
that when she met King she pressed
the revolver, which she had concealed
under her skirt, to her heart, Intending
to kill herself, but that King grabbed
the weapon with his right hand. The
woman, being determined to destroy
herself, kept her grip on the revolver.
In the struggle for Its possession the
weapon was discharged and the fatal
wound was inflicted. Miss Kerr's left
hand bears a large powder burn.
Further evidence that the shooting of
King was accidental comes fium the
dying man, who is reported as having
declared in his ante-mortem statement
that he took upon himself all the blame
for the tragedy..*7: 7
The woman, who is well known In
San Francisco and Seattle, is a con
sumptive. She has paced the floor of
fier cell in the City Jail ever since her
arrest, muttering prayers for the re
covery of her lover.
"Oh that George may live and I be
taken in his place,'* Is her constantly
expressed wish. "Surely I could not
harm a hair of his. head, for he Is my
husband. We were married a year ago
last August." _Â§bÂ£B*Â§B
This .declaration on the part of the
woman will form an additional link
in the chain of surprises which this
tragedy has revealed. King is in a
dying condition. The physician said
at a late hour that he might possibly
survive until to-morrow noon. â¢

Lively Scramble Between American

Special Cable to The Call and the new Tork
Herald Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, Dec. 31.â sooner had
the purchase of Havana street railways
been effected than a second and more
Important deal is announced. This is
for the control, consolidation, extension
and equipment of all lines of railway
now in operation on the island. This
time English capitalists seem likely to
win the prize, for the reason that they
already own the United Railway, the
lines of which : run from Havana and
Regla to Matanzas and Cardenas. This
concern also owns the Bank of Com
merce of Havana and the Regla Sugar
Warehouses, all, valuable property. It
will require an investment of $10,000,000
to $15,000,000 to handle this deal, which
means the control of 1100 miles of rail
road already In operation and as much
more in. contemplation, the franchises
for which already exist.
These lines do not parallel the pro
posed route of Secretary Alger's back
bone railroad, yet they tap every field
of production in Cuba and can easily
be connected Into an Integral system.
They have the advantage of touching
all Important seaports, thus giving
cheap water freights.
While the English capitalists seem to
have the advantage at present, they
will not secure the prize without strug
gle. The same American syndicates
that fought for the Havana street rail
ways are ready to advance all capital
necessary for the control of the rail
roads. __________

SAN JOSE, Dec. 31.â While great Inter

CHICAGO, Dec. 31.â Two Chicago as
tronomers have just i" en elected asso
ciate members of the Royal Astrono
mical Society oÂ£ Great Britain. The
honors come, too, in the form of holi
day presents. They are Professor E.
E. Barnard of Yerkes Observatory and
Professor S. W. Burnham of the Uni
versity of Chicago. The honors thus re
ceived by Professors Barnard and
Burnham are very high, and longed for
by all who study the stars, inasmuch
as the associate members, elected by
the Royal Society, are severely limited
in number.
â¢ In this case the distinguished recogni
tion came to men who have been for
many years companions in pleasant
labor in the fields of science. They
have known cadi other and called each
other friend for many years, and on
Christmas day, when they met in the
spacious library and work room of
Yerkes Observatory at Lake Geneva,
each handed to the other his Christ
mas gift. 'â¢'.
Professor Barnard, though still a
comparatively young man. is one of the
foremost and best known astronomers
in. the country, if not in the world,
and has been, in common with Profes
â¢ sot: Burnham, for many years a fre
quent and valued correspondent of the
'Royal Astronomical Society. The pa
â¢ per s of both, contributed to the society ,
â¢'from time to time, have attracted wide
7attention from the world of science.
â  Professor Barnard several years ago
â¢was the associate of Professor Burn-,
ham at Lick Observatory. Mount Ham
ilton. Cal. He was also, for a time, sta
tioned at the observatory at Flagstaff,
Arizona, and his astronomical discov
eries at both observatories brought him j
deservedly Into notice in the highest ,
scientific circles of this and other coun- '
tries. He is now in charge of the i
Yerkes Observatory at Lake Geneva.
Professor Burnham has long been a
familiar figure in Chicago. Besides be- j
Ing professor emeritus of astronomy in
the University of Chicago, he is asso
ciate in the valuable work being done!

IT IS A MEDICAL
SEA SERPEN T STORY
Report of the Transplanting of a I
Rabbit's Eye Into a Woman's
Head Declared Absurd.
PARIS, Dec. 31.â The Daily Mail having
published an account of the surprising
operation successfully performed at Min
neapolis whereby the eye of a rabbit was
transplanted and thus sight restored to
n young woman blind for fifteen years, I
asked the opinion of a few leading sur
geons here oh the operation. All agreed
that in the present state of scientific
knowledge the reported operation was ab
solutely impossible. One said that unless
the details were exaggerated a miracle
had been performed.
Dr. Doyen observed that even if the eye
were successfully transplanted the res
toration of sight would not necessarily
follow, lie says it is a sort of "medical
sea serpent." being a report that reap
pears periodically and always unfortu
nately without any truth in it. ' ''
Dr. A. Le Duntu laughed at the idea.
He said it was tried at Clermont Eerrand
some years ago without avail. Perhaps
if the operation had succeeded it would
be necessary, he said, to repeat it every
four years, a rabbit's life being. so much
shorter than a man's just a- in About.-;

yer whose nose had been cut off in a duel
and replaced it by a grafted piece taken
out of a drunkard's arm finds hat his

AMAZED BY
AMERICA'S
EXPANSION
But Europe Dare Not
Interfere.
IRRITATION BUT RESPECT
NICE THINGS SAID BY THE BRIT
ISH NEWSPAPERS.
Stiffening of the General Policy of
English-Speaking Races
Which Govern Half
the World.
T â
Copyrighted, IS9S, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, Dec. 31.â The Spectator
this week epitomizes the reviews of the
passing year, which till all to-day's
newspapers, declaring that "the domi
nant fact of 1898 has been the rise li
the position of the English-speaking
pies." It describes how Europe has
been amazed and irritated by the ex
pansion of America, though Europe has
not dared to Interfere. But, the Spec
tator says, the powers are apprehensive
that the change may compel a defens
ive coalition of the military powers of
Europe. It also quoted one periodical
as saying that the waves of European
contempt for Great Britain have been
succeeded by respect compelled by the.
stiffening of the general policy of the
English-speaking races, which, "disre
garded in IS'JT, are, in lSi***-., regarded as
the potential equals of the remainder
of the world."
Though usually pessimistic, the Spec
tator concludes in the spirit of Kip
ling's "Recessional," saying: "The
English-speaking peoples may govern
half the world Without graeiouspess or
system, But if they try to govern it
without justice ana consideration for
the rights of others, their dominion will
some terrible day come crashing down."
The word America might well be
written at tne head of an Ulese annual
reviews, as tin- text is so overshadow
ing in the attention which they devote
to the republic's affairs. This new feel
ing contrasts sharply with the same
writers' feelings in recent years, when
they found little worthy of comment,
save the lynchings and the corruption
in different cities. The friendliness of
all articles is equally conspicuous,
though its universal sincerity is not
credited by Americans acquainted with
the inner workings of British foreign
policy, and who know that several of
the papers acquired this good will only
when the British Government, during
the recent war with Spain, hinted to
them that it was a most Important op
portunity to cultivate the friendship of
the United States, and that is should be
i improved. .7 ' . / 7 ,
The only growl comes from the faat
urday Review, which, discussing the
French encroachments on Liberia and
the possibility of its attempted absorp
tion, says: -Would it not be more ap
propriate that the United States should
vent their new imperial ambitions by
taking charge of then wretched off
spring?" -'â "* . * .
The prospectus with which the Amer
ican Anti-Imperialist League supplied
all the newspapers here this week, ap
parently hoping to enlist British sup
port of their movement, was treated re
spectfully but coldly, while the press
unanimously urges the United States -to
suppress the Filipinos summarily it
they are troublesome. . y
The new year brings Ireland the
greatest experiment since cathohp
emancipation, namely, the Initiation of
the local government act, which really,
in many of its features, is an extension
of the emancipation acts and policy.
The femes throughout Ireland are
placarded with the addresses of the
candidates for membership of the dis
trict councils, which the act estab
lishes, and appeals from landlords and
former grand jurors are posted beside
those of tenant farmers and laborers.
While strict party lines are not yet
drawn there is a distinct line of cleav
age one Bet in which the landlord class
predominates, hailing the scheme as a
solution of the Irish problem and
"promising to legislate solely for the
good of the people. The other, chiefly
the laboring class, promises to work in
the new positions along the old lines
for the realization of home rule.
The Irish leaders are divided, as
usual, John Redmond advising the peo
ple to accept the new departure in
good faith, arguing that a successful
administration of the act will lead to
an extension of self-government. Mr.
Dillon exhorts his followers to continue
home rule agitation in the councils.
But whether the cause of the year's
unusual prosperity as shown by the
banks and railroad receipts, the statis
tics of the fisheries, linen or whisky
industries or the Government's conces
sions, political agitation is at the low
est ebb for several years past. Many
Irishmen deem it impolitic to assail the
Government while Parliament has be
fore it bills providing for the establish
ment of a Catholic university and a
board of agriculture. The prospects of
the former seems to have had a most
soothing effect on the clerical agita
tors.
The present upheaval at Johannes
burg is not likely to reach the* fighting
stage, but It is another Item in the bill
of grievances which the Uitlanders
think must eventually be swelled to a
total justifying compulsion upon the
Boers to Improve the status of the for
eign residents in the transvaal republic.
A Londoner who was In prison in con
nection with the Jameson raid and who
has the best acquaintance with the
country, but who is under bonds not to
allow his name to be in political dis
cussion, said: "The logic of events is
driving England toward Interference in
the Transvaal, even more strongly than
the United ' States was driven ty inter
fere in Cuba. President Kruger has
become very friendly to England since
he lost his brief hope of German sup
port, kindled by Emperor William's
telegram. He is probably an honest
fanatic, but he is in the hands of a
ring all rich, whose object is to squeeze
as much as possible out of the for
eigners." \
Cecil Rhodes Is on his way back to
England. Having lived down the en
mity of a portion of the Liberals and
the nonconformists, he is likely to dic
tate the Government's African policy.
The report comes from an unusually
well-informed source that the British
Government contemplates being repre
sented at the tzar's peace conference
by the Prince nf Wales, the Marquis
of Salisbury arid Lord Rosebery, aided
by military and naval commissions. If

SAD THE PASSING
OF FATHER WALSH
Rector of the Cathedral Paris!} at
SacrameQto Asphyxiated-, by
Escaping Gas.
REV. FATHER MICHAEL WALSH.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 31.â Angelus which clanged from the high
tower of the cathedral this morning, was taken by a group of sor
rowing Churchmen as a requiem for the soul of Rev. Father Michael
Walsh, who was found dead a few minutes before 6 o'clock in the
rector's room in the Episcopal residence. . The sister who parted
with Father Walsh in Oakland yesterday afternoon had no foreboding of
the fate which was to encompass her brother before the dawn of another
day. Those who met him on the train last night were, greeted with a
pleasant smile and a word of cheer.
Father Walsh preached a sermon in the cathedral on Christmas day
before several thousand parishioners. Ever since the elevation of Right
Rev. Thomas Grace to the bishopric of the diocese Father Walsh has
been rector of the cathedral parish. Early and late he labored, leaving his
bed.at all hours of the night to visit the homes of the poor, to adminis
ter the consolation of his religion to some unfortunate in death's
shadow. The work told on the priest, and after the Christmas service he
was given leave to visit his sister, Mrs. Maggie Fennessy.of Oakland. He
returned by a late train last night and went to his room. ?*>..?
This morning when the sexton arose to sound the Angelus upon the
cathedral chimes he detected the odor of gas, which appeared to come
from the direction of Father Walsh's room. The housekeeper was sum
moned and together they obtained entrance to the apartment. Horror took
the place of their first indefinable fears when they discovered the priest
lying in his' night raiment on the bed, dead. ?â  --
Bishop Grace was at once notified, 'with other merhbers of the Epis
copal household, and after their first shock of grief they made a quick
investigation into the cause of his sad passing.
' When the Episcopal residence was built some years ago electricity
was- not in common use and the house was fitted with ordinary gas fix
tures* Afterward, when electricity was introduced more generally wires
were' run along the fixture's and light bulbs attached to the ends next to
the gas jets. This brought the electric light buttons and the gas stop
cocks within two or three inches of each other. It is' the belief that when
Father Walsh had prepared himself for bed he turned off the electric
lgiht. and in so doing his wrist moved the gas stopcock sufficiently to
permit a steady flow of gas during the night.. The night was bitterly
cold. and Father Walsh had observed his practice of closing the win
dows and the transom, his system being peculiarly susceptible to low
temperature-.
During the night Rev. Father Brady, whose room is not far away,
awoke and thought he heard Father Walsh murmuring in his sleep.
"He is dreaming, no doubt." thought, the priest. The sounds died
away and they were the last Father Brady- will ever hear from the lips
of his beloved colleague.
Father Walsh was born in Westerford, Ireland, forty-six years
ago. In Carson City, Nev., twenty-six years ago, he began his duties as
a priest. He was afterward associated with Rev. Father Hines at Wood
land and assumed the rectorate of the local parish when Father Grace
became bishop.
The funeral will take place on Tuesday morning and the pontifical
requiem mass, to be celebrated by Bishop Grace, will be attended by
priests from all points in the diocese, which embraces Northern Cali
fornia and most of the State of Nevada. Bishop Grace was the recipient
to-day of messages of sympathy and sorrow from prominent churchmen
in all parts of the State.

was formally installed this week as

to appreciate the fact that he has an
opportunity to advance the prestige of.
Greece as well as his own personal
prestige. He has begun to rule with
an iron hand. The Prince found the
Island honeycombed with religious and
political factions, each threatening out
rages upon its enemies. He quickly
ordered the soldiers to adopt drastic
measures and announced that he would
suppress disorder even if he had to turn
the whole island into barracks. His

by the United States, with guarantees
of its neutrality in case of war. The
negotiations on the subject are not be

beyond personal exchanges of views be

gold mining on the .west coast of
Africa, which they believe to be one of
the greatest fields.
They have sent a force of engineers
there under the leadership of a young
Californian named Hoffman, and pros
pecting will be conducted on a scientific
basis. Hammond predicts that Africa's
gold output next year will be $100,000.

GILLETT THE CAUSE
OF A BANK'S FAILURE
j Held the Cattle Plunger's Paper,
Which Caused a Run That Could
Not Be Checked.
ST. JOSEPH, Mo.. Dec 31.â Central
Savings Bank of St. Joseph has suspended
business. It has gone into voluntary
liquidation. This action is due primarily
to the failure of G. G. Gillett. the Kansas
cattle plunger. The bank held several
thousand dollars of his paper. The sum
was not really large enough to do the In
stitution even temporary injury, but when
the fact became known public depositors
were frightened and started a run. This
was three weeks ago. The directors tem
porarily closed, re-established confidence |
and resumed business alter two days.
Patrons continued withdrawals, however,
and the death of Louis I lax. the million
aire president of the bank, on December
_.".. brought matters to a crisis. Secretary
of State Lessar was here to-day and held
a conference with, the directors. Applica
| tion was made for a receiver to Judge

FIEND'S LIFE
ENDS ON THE
GUILLOTINE
Execution of Joseph
Vacher.
FRENCH "JACK THE RIPPER"
_ __ .
COMMITTED OVER. A SCORE OF
MURDERS.
His Most Prominent Victim, the
Marquis de Villeplaine, Stain
While Walking in
His Park.
BDecial Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Dec. 31.â Joseph Vacher, the
French "Jack the Ripper," was guillo
tined at Bourghon-Bresse, capital of
the Department of the Am, this morn
ing. He protested his innocence and
simulated insanity to the last.
Vacher, who was 29 years of age, was
condemned at the October assizes.
Early in life he Is known to have bru
tally murdered ' four boys, six women
and girls and an old widow.- Most of
the victims were tending herds, when
Vacher came behind them and cut their
throats.
The crimes of Vacher really sur
passed in number and atrocity those of
the Whitechapel murderer known as
"Jack the Ripper." His homicidal
mania first broke out in 1894. In de
fense of Vacher, it Was pointed out that
when a youth he was bitten by, a mad
dog, and that the village herbalist gave
him some medicine, after drinking
which he became irritable and brutal,
whereas he had previously been quiet
and inoffensive. It also appears, from
these statements, that from that time
he had a passion for human blood.
* The exact number of Vacher's vic
tims will never be known, but, it is said,
twenty-three assassinations had been
brought home to him in October last,
and the number was added to as time
.wore on. In fact, it is doubtful whethei
the murderer himself knew the real
number of his victims. He nonchalantly
told the details to the examining Magis-
I trate as they came back to his mind,
' and in each case the investigation fur
j nished full corroboration of Vacher's
' narrative. The bodies were all found
|in the places he indicatedâ in thickets,
or in unused wells. He seems to have
killed merely for the sake of killing.
The most prominent victim of Vacher
I was the Marquis de Villeplaine, who
was killed while walking in his park in
the southwestern part of France, not
far from the Spanish frontier. Vacher
crept up behind him, felled him with a
heavy stick and then cut his throat.
The murderer carried off the coat of
the Marquis and his pocketbook, con-.
! taining some banknotes. He then
sought refuge in Spain.
The boasting of the murderer led to
the detection of a number of his crimes
after his arrest. For instance he killed
a boy, 16 years of age, named Bully,
near Lyons, in June f 1897. Â« The crime
would not have been discovered but for
the boastings of Vacher, as the lad was
a notorious poacher and chicken-thief
and his disappearance created no stir
at all. " y ;

WASHINGTON. Dec. 31.â Funeral serv

Saecial Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dec. 31.â Ex-Judge S. P.
McConnell, one of the Illinois delegates
at-large to the National Democratic
Convention in 1896, delivered an ad
dress before the Monticello.Club to-day,
which caused a good deal of talk among
local Democrats, particularly in view
of the fact that he has been a close
political associate of ex-Governor John
P. Altgeld. The speaker began by
quoting these declarations of the club:
"We oppose all trusts and monopolies In
order that wealth may not gain undue ad
vantage and that competition shall be
free and unrestrained among the people.
We oppose the single gom standard and
favor the restoration Of bimetallism, re
gardless of the action or desire of any
other nation.
He said in part:
These declarations, ln my judgment, are
expressive of the great mission of the Dem
ocratic party. I am inclined, however, to
believe that the ttrst includes the second,
and that the war against monopolies and
trusts means war against the single gold
standard, if the contest is to be waged
intelligently and effectively. lam certain,
too, that the Ilrst declaration , requires
and means hostility to protective tar
iff laws. in fact, under the encourage
ment and aid of these laws the trusts and
combinations encroaching upon free com
petition are called into existence. Even
after all that has been said a~ainst the
combinations, trusts and monopolies, I am
far from convinced that the body of the
people equally appreciate the great peril
to their wordlv welfare springing from
these vast aggregations of capital, which
are gradually absorbing and controlling
the industrial activities of the country.
Thousands' who voted for Mr. McKinley
In 1896 are ready to join us in a campaign
to be waged against- trusts, combinations
and monopolies. They only need evidence
; that we will tight euectively.
There is but one plank in the platform
' of 1896 which prevents these thousands be
ing openly and aggressively with us. They
do not. believe in the remonetization of
silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 of gold. They
regard it as even less defensible now than
two years ago.
The question for us to * consider Is
whether we are showing an appreciation
of the relative importance of issues when
we seem to be willing to run the peril
of repeating the experience of 1896 rather
than to modify our proposition regarding
the ratio between silver and gold. To my
mind the 16 to 1 proposition i.as always
savored 'something of superstition, and
I have come to believe that the best
friends of bimetallism are not those who
refuse to have it except -on this condi
tion. I should begin to be skeptical of
their- value as opponents of monopoly If
they persist that it must be fought only
in connection with those radical demands
for the restoration of silver at the value
it had more than a quarter of a century
ago. .. * â - â :.-;â¢
With aggressive declarations In the
platform of 1900 against trusts and mon
opolies and against their great allies and
supportsâ the gold standard and protec
tive tariffâ without insisting on a particu
lar value for silver in a plan for its re
monetization or a particular schedule for
a revenue tariff, and .with the same great
leader (Bryan) for its candidate, the
Democratic party will be assured of suc
cess and the people through its victory
will be assured of tne blessings of healthy
competition, freedom in trade and honest
money. â¢ y . . j i
DARRAH'S SLAYER FREED.
John F. Milner's Fourth Trial Re
sults in an Acquittal.
RIVERSIDE, Dec. 31.-John F. Milner,
who shot and killed S. J. Darrah near
Banning in September, 1897, in a dispute
over a water right, was acquitted to-day
on his fourth trial. On the first trial Mil
ner was convicted of murder in the sec
ond degree, but got a new trial. On the
second' trial he was convicted of man
slaughter! and sentenced to six years. He
was given a new trial by the Supreme
Court. The third trial resulted in a dis
agreement by the jury and now the fourth
jury sets him free. Milner has spent a
year in the County Jail.
Condemns Anti-Semitic Crusade.
LONDON, Dec. 31.â The Paris corre
spondent of the Daily Chronicle says: In
clerical circles it is asserted that the Pope
will issue an encyclical condemning the
anti-Semitic crusade in Algeria, and inci
dentally alluding to the Dreyfus case.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
When a young man asks a father for his
daughter's hand in marriage, if toe father
is a wise one, he thinks of one thing equal-
ly as important as the young man's morals,
social and business standing and intelli
gence. A young man who suffers from ill-
health has no right to marry until his health
is restored. To do so is to commit a crime
against the human race. While all diseases
may not be directly inherited, the constitu-
tional tendency to acquire them is inher-
ited. If a man is a consumptive, the
chances are that his children will have
weak, undersized lungs, and a predisposi-
tion to acquire the same disease.
The young man who suffers from bron-
chitis, weak lungs, spitting of blood or any
disease of the air-passages which, if neg-
lected leads up to consumption, may take
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery with
almost absolute assurance of recovery. It
cures 98 per cent, of all -cases when taken
in time. It soothes and heals the delicate
and sensitive tissues of the air-passages and
lungs, checks the cough, facilitates expect-
oration, drives out all impurities land dis-
ease germs from the tainted blnod and
builds new and healthy tissues. f!
â¢ Mr. John G. Born, of 4020 Liberty Aye.. Pitts-
burgh, Pa., writes : "Some thirty months ago I
said to my wife. ' I don't want to keep anything
from you, I must tell you I am in the last stage
of consumption.' In December 1896 I commenced
taking Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery.
I could then only speak in whispers. I have
taken thirteen bottles, and can say with truth I
am greatly benefited. People are surprised to
hear me speak. I can halloo, and my v c has
not been as good in eight years, My stomach
was never in better condition. Formerly I could
not eat without suffering very much immediately
after, but now I can eat anythiasv".'.

HAPPY NEW YEOR.
WITH watch services in the churches, with
merry parties at home, with uproar upon the
streets, with music and dancing and laughter,
with ail forms of joy and modes of expressing it,
wo have ushered the old year out and welcomed the
new year in. With good resolves and with bright
expectations the dawn is greeted and out of their own
sanguine hopes men and women find the inspiration
of a most cordial wish for a happy new year for all.
With the exception of the menace of another dry
season which impends above us from our cloudless
skies, there arc no reasons for doubting the new
year will be one of unexampled prosperity for all of
our people. Industry has not only revived from the
long depression but has attained an unprecedented
activity. The products of our factories as well as of
our farms are making their way in all the great mar
kets of the earth, and the demand for them has so ex
panded our foreign commerce that it has become the
marvel of the world.
The fear of a possible gold stringency which in the
past haunted the minds of so many persons and ren
dered some timid capitalists unwilling to venture new
enterprises has been banished. Not only has the
gold supply of the United States been augmented by
importations from abroad as well as from the out
put of our own mines, but the gold supply of the
world has been enormously increased.
. It is estimated that within the last seven years the
increase of the world's supply of gold has amounted
to as much as forty per cent, and that if the present
rate of gold production continues the world's supply
will rise during this new year to $5,000,000,000/ and
c that of this the United States will have more than
$*i,r;bo.ooo,ooo.
. When the old year began Cuba was ravaged by
Spanish tyranny and the necessity of our interference
even at the risk of war was apparent. Those evils no
â¢. longer cloud the sky. The war has been gloriously
fought out, and not only Cuba but Porto Rico and
the? Philippine- as well, have been freed from the old
time oppression, The new year begins with peace
assured at home and abroad. We have added addi
tional honor- to our arms and another glorious page
to our history. We have also so clearly demonstrated
our military power it is not likely any nation will
provoke us to war. and we may, therefore, look
forward to another long extended peace.
3. Out of the old year, morevcr, there comes the as
..-.â â --- 'â Â»-â  . . â  . Â»-.-â  ,'. - â  yâ â¢ -â¢â  . â  .. -
surance of a restored confidence between the North
and the South which i- full of promise for the new.
Never since the nation began was there so little of
sectional antagonism in our politics and our social
feelings. In the gladness of that union of hearts as
well as of hands the interchange of mutual wishes of
.prosperity among all parts of the republic will he
more fervent than ever. However it may be with the
fortunes of individuals, that of the Union is likely to
be the brightest and most golden in its history,
through all the seasons of the glad new year. â¢
The State Superintendent of Instruction does not
think teachers' institutes conducted so as to be help
ful. If this opinion is well founded perhaps he can
inaugurate. reforms. Neither are Boards of Educa
tion managed as they should be, but there seems no
method of reform short of sending a lot of rogues to
fail; and the rogues, each equipped with a pull, refuse
to go.
An employe of the Wells-Fargo Express Company
has run away with $60,000 of its funds, a wicked and
reprehensible act. However, it may be he salves his
conscience by the reflection that by violation of the
internal revenue bill the company had acquired a
much larger sum than that with which he eloped.
Attorney Knight says one can never guess what a
jury will do. He might have added that one can
safely guess no twelve intelligent men can be swayed
by the bully-ragging tactics of an advocate who treats
a witness as a criminal. â¢??* â¢
Nicholas Brennan has escaped punishment for a
peculiarly heinous offense, and there is no way in
which he could better express his gratitude than by

munity now. ..--.'
Widber says that at the end of his term he will be
on Easy street, which being interpreted probably
means that he knows where there is some of the gold
Mayor Phelan supposed himself to be hefting. i
'71f the Dunning case is in arty measure responsible

THE RAILROAD AND ITS CANDIDATE.
IT would be inconceivable, it it were not apparently
â¢?a palpable fact, that the Southern Pacific Com
pany should seriously attempt to foist Dan Burns
upon the State of California as the successor of Sen- ;
ator White and the colleague of Senator Perkins. So ;
grotesque* a caricature of a true representative of the
sovereign dignity of the State would be as anomalous
as the horse that Nero elevated to the dignity of a
consul. The excuse for that seemingly mad act
might have been that, in the filthy politics and de
based society of those days, the horse was a nobler
animal than man. In, the case before us, however,
no such palliation would exist. The election of Dan
Burns would be nothing less than the wanton and
arbitrary exercise of power by a corporation,- drunk
with success' arid- determined to slap and kick the
public with a reckless disregard of consequences.
In the late canvass the press and the people were
made to believe that the Southern Pacific Company
was out of politics. That did not imply that its
officers and its employes should abstain from exer
cising their legitimate influence as citizens upon the .
election. But it did mean that, in a corporate sense j
and especially in the methods of canvassing, the hand
of the railroad, had been withdrawn. It is probably j
true that, owing to the intelligence and the independ- |
ence of the people and th- ttSSlty of abstinence
from any ostensible and improper interference with
the exercise of the elective franchise, the result of
lie election was an expression in this, as in other
States, of the popular will, based upon principle and
upon practical issues. But the undisclosed and secret
intention to rule the State after the election has now
been manifested, unless all signs have failed. It is at
least generally believed that the Southern Pacific
Company has determined, in the face of every ob
stacle, to elect Dan Burns, and whether this be the
actual fact or that Dan Burns is a dummy and used
as an adroit diversion to secure the choice of some
other candidate equally objectionable, is immaterial.
There was never a better chance than the defeat of
the fusion candidates offered to extirpate from our
local politics every disturbing and corrupt element, to
close the long and dreary conflict between the domi
nant railroad and the people, which,, for so many
years, has paralyzed enterprise and arrested natural
progress and development, and to unite all good citi
zens in a supreme effort to utilize the advantages and i
the opportunities that lie thickly around us and to j
bring about an era of matchless prosperity and good
feeling.
The good faith of the Republican press is proved by
the unanimity with which it denounces the impudent j
pretensions put forward by the advocates of the gentle
man from Mexico. And a somewhat important ele
ment to be considered is the Legislature itself. The
presumption is that it is a representative body, fresh
from its constituent? and not owned or to be handled j
by mercenaries or corruptiOnists. It is difficult, in- j
deed impossible, even to conjecture that there could
be boldnc-g;, venality and stolidity enough in the
members oTan Assembly and a Senate who less than
two months ago were proclaiming their own man
hood and freedom from railroad influence all over j
the State, and who have been selected in the neigh
borhoods where they reside as exemplars of intelli
gence, education and character, to enable them delib
erately to elect a man like Dan Burns at the bidding of
a corporation and in the face of the press and the i
people. There have been and there are many j
audacious scoundrels in this world and in this part i
of the world, but they are not usually sent to those j
legislative councils which are supposed to form the
most complete and the most sensitive connection be
tween citizens and the government. Some men have
strong nerves and rotten hearts, but there are few
who are more than willing, even anxious, to disgrace
not only themselves, but their families and their ,
neighbors, and then return to localities where they
must obviously be held in contempt for the remainder
of their lives. Instances of secret corruption are not
unfamiliar even under popular institutions, but the
unblushing parade of treachery, dishonesty and ser- j
vility is a rare exception among free American citi- i
zens. The Republican party is a political organiza
tion which went before the country in the late elec- |
! tions upon its record, its principles and its sturdy ,
j professions of patriotism and purity. It was helped
by many of the ablest and best Democrats, who re
jected the free silver heresy and the proposed disrup- j
tion of the constitution through bare majorities. I
What a despicable attitude it would occupy in this ;
[ State if, within a few weeks of its entrenchment in i
S popular confidence? it became, through its Legisla- !
ture, the purchased vassal of a railroad and sent an i
i exposed and arrant knave, with a triple crown of j
infamy on his head, as a chosen agent of the State j
iin the Federal Senate. â¢ .
i
We do not believe that this unprecedented outrage
upon the nation, upon the State, upon the men who
fill the seats of Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Benton,
Douglas, Col lamer, Cass and the other illustrious
statesmen who wrought upon* the structure of this
mighty nation, will, be perpetrated. We have no
reason to disparage the gentlemen who are about to
assemble at Sacramento, as recent telegrams pub
lished in The Call amply attest. We feci confident
that they will not disparage themselves by sinking
into the quagmire which is now shaking beneath
thtir feet. The perception of an attempt even to
treat them as lewd and purchasable justifies indigna
tion and is a sufficient excuse for alarm.
California has not usually been represented in the
United States Senate by common or by bad men.
William M. Gwin was a man of commanding pres
ence, of great ability and energy, familiar with the
leading statesmen of the country, who, though not
possessed of the charm of oratory or facility in
debate, nevertheless accomplished much for this com
monwealth. John R. Wcller, first Senator and then
Governor, had a national reputation. David C. Brod
erick, whose rise from obscurity to the United States
Senate was a marvelous exhibition of capacity and
of force, who lived without a personal vice and who
died in honor, was an ornament to the Chamber, in
which he discerned the evidence of his father's handi
work. Milton S. Latham, first Governor and then
Senator, possessed brains and culture to an unusual
degree. James A. McDougal was powerful in debate
and attained a prophetic height by the prescience with
which he detected the French designs upon Mexico
and strengthened the hands of the patriots who finally
executed Maximilian. A. A. Sargent exhibited keen
intelligence and remarkable 'industry, applied to
knowledge of details, and ably transacted the business
of the State and of the country. A. P. Williams was !
a merchant of broad. mind and of unusual capacity !
for work. Newton Booth was a scholar and a
dialectician who secured national renown.
We have omitted reference to the incumbents of this
high office during recent years, but these are a few
names taken from the list of our Senators for nearly
half a century. They awaken reminiscences that ex
cite pride and not shame.- Of our present Senators it
need only be said that they are able, laborious. and
conscientious men.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 1, 1599.
AVOID THE CAUCUS SCHEME.
. .-.â â -...
HOWEVER cunningly the '* campaign of Dan
Burns has been conducted, there is only one
way in which he can secure final triumph. This
is through the agency of a caucus. No further rea
son need be given why there should be no caucus. â¢
There are certain members who are afraid to vote
for Burns or a creature of Burns on account of the
storm of disapproval whifh would come from their
homes. These members there will be an endeavor to
use by means of a caucus. If sixty-one Republicans
go into caucus and agree to be bound by the majority
rule, as. is often done, then any candidate who gets
thirty-one votes will actually, by virtue of themajor
ity rule, receive the indorsement of sixty-one votes, or
enough members to elect. Thus; by securing thirty
one votes, which is only about one-fourth of the mem
bership of both houses, a candidate can be elected
United States Senator.
That there is danger of this result must be realized
because members who dare not vote for Burns under
other circumstances would shield themselves behind
the following argument: "I did not vote for him. I
never would have voted for him, but we pursued the
usual course, entered a caucus and agreed to be bound
by the votes of the majority."
Thus members who really desire the election of an
objectionable candidate can shield themselves from
criticism, and at the same time carry out the wishes
of their masters. Let it be understood before any
such/ action is had that any member who goes into
such a caucus will be as blamable if an objectionable
candidate be chosen as if he had openly declared him
self for such candidate.
The fight from this time on until a Senator has
been chosen should be to prevent a caucus of Repub
lican members. Upon the success of this fight de
pends the honor of the party.
THE suggestion that failures of justice such as
took place in the Rosser case could be prevented
by appointing or electing ' Judges for life
may be designated as reductio ad absurdum.
Much can be said in favor of a life judi
i ciary, it is true, but more may be said
against it when it is applied to a political sys
i tern such as exists in this city. Undoubtedly life
Judges are more dignified, more independent and
personally cleaner than elected Judges, but if they are
to be introduced here, along with them must come an
entirely new judicial system.
Failures of justice are usually due to the weakness,
ignorance or corruption of District Attorneys and
juries. The Judges ordinarily try to do their duty.
How can juries be improved so long as political
Sheriffs summon them and political clerks draw them
from the box? But even if life Judges could change
the laws so as to improve the quality of juries, what
remedy is there for a weak, neglectful' or corrupt
District Attorney? Judges cannot prosecute crim
inal cases. They can call for evidence, but it will not
be forthcoming unless the Police Department gathers
it and the District Attorney summons the witnesses.
Of what avail are the efforts of a conscientious Judge
surrounded by case fixers, weak prosecutors and po
litical jurors?
In the Rosser case there was evidence to show that
! the culprit had been drugged while drinking whisky.
1 The place where he obtained the liquor was iden
j tified and the firewater itself was carefully described;
1 but it never occurred to anybody to call the saloon
keeper who sold the stuff. In fact, the theory that
Rosser had been drugged was the wildest kind of an
assumption, which the District Attorney made not the
slightest. effort to refute. Had he summoned any
i body likely to know the facts, outside of Rosser's
': comrades and friends, he could have flatly contra
; dieted the evidence for the defense.
Judges elected or appointed, for life would have no
. power to prevent farces of this character. They could
not inject intelligence into juries nor thwart the case
fixers. All they could do would be to perform their
duty, which in most cases they do now.
The weak point in our criminal judicial system is
found in the prosecution. What every county in Cali
fornia needs is a competent District Attorney. The
only way the people can procure the services of such
' a man will be to offer to energetic, honest and ca
pable lawyers compensation equivalent to the sums
'. they can make by working for criminals. This is all
! tnere is in the problem.
A District Attorney in San Francisco receiving a
â  salary of $20,000 a year would be a paying invest
', ment. That sum would command the services of a
j first-class lawyer, who, once in office, would stay
! there so long as virtue continued in the community.
I Such a man would rid the city of criminals in less
than a year, because he would make, even under the
1 present system, punishment for all classes of crime
| absolutely certain.
PROM the report made by Major W. H. Daly,
chief surgeon at army headquarters at Tampa
during the war. on the fresh meat supplied to the
army it is evident that General Miles did not exag
gerate when he. characterized the stuff as ''embalmed
beef." In fact, his language was not severe enough.
He might with considerable justness have described
it as poisoned beef.
In the course of his report Major Daly says:
"When detailed to take charge of the transport
Panama for conveying convalescents to the United
States, I obtained 2000. pounds of fresh beef from the
commissary at Ponce. It looked well, but had an
odor similar to that of a dead human body after being
injected with preservatives, and tasted when first
cooked like decomposed bodies smell. After standing
a day for further inspection it became so bitter, nas
eous and unpalatable as to be quite impossible for
use. I was, therefore, obliged, owing to the condition
and the complaints of the sick about it, and the dis
gustingly sickening odor it emitted when being
cooked, and its mawkish, flat taste when served, and
for the safety of the patients, 255 convalescent soldiers
on board, to organize a board of survey, condemn
and throw 1500 pounds, all we had, overboard.
The United States is a rich country and is liberal
with those with whom it deals. It pays high prices
and is entitled to honest goods for its money. More
over? it is a country where all sorts of food supplies
exist far beyond the consuming power of its people.
For such an act as that of furnishing vile beef to the
soldiers at the front there is no excuse whatever. It
was a criminal swindle and in its motive was about
as vicious as that of a woman who sends poisoned
candy through the mails. 7
There should be some punishment meted out to
the scoundrels who, in their greed for gain, sent such
stuff "as "that to supply our boys, at the front and in
the hospitals. In many respects the offense, is the
gravest scandal of the year, and is certainly the basest.
There should be some. way of indicting the men who
are responsible for the crime on a charge of murder
and committing them to the justice and the patriotism
of an American jury.

Why the people of this country should
act like a lot of blithering idiots when
ever the subject of their thoughts hap
pens to be some person with the solitary
recommendation, if it be such, of hav
ing possession of unearned and un
merited millions is so difficult to- un
derstand that the attempt to do so is
futile. Here is a row raised over the
rumor that Miss Fair is to become the
wife of a Vanderbilt, and the papers
are full of it. Ac these people are old
enough to attend to the matter and as
the union would be that of the com
monplace to its kind, there is not the
slightest occasion for hysterics.
*. * *
One thing made certain by a view and
a smell of the political situation in
that there must be reforms, including
election of Senators by popular vote,
or this republic will sink under the
weight of internal corruption. Anti
expansionists may howl as they please
about the danger of acquiring foreign
territory, overriding the constitution,
and governing without the consent of
the governed, all of which may be con
siderable but the real peril to our in
stitutions is from domestic rot. It has
come even now to the pass where the
word of a professional politician is
worthless. A pledge is nothing, if the
other man has the price, and this fact
is painful particularly in the election
of Senators. It is not possible to buy
the people of a State, but that it is
possible to buy the members of a Leg
islature has been demonstrated again
and again, and to this demonstration
California has added more than her
share. The average legislator seems to
have no idea but to put himself on the
bargain counter. So long as this
shameful condition shall continue there
can be no confidence in the stability
of the government. It is no longer a
government of the people, but the ar
bitrary rule of moneyed rascality. The
people are, in fact, powerless. The leg
islator is not wholly to blame. When
a man, elected to the Assembly from
some walk where he has never earned
so great an income as that constituted
by his legitimate salary in public life,
finds that he can make extra thousands
by voting for a particular man for
Senator, the temptation is a sore one.
It is right that he should be protected
against it. It is a grievous wrong that
he should be subject to inducements to
betray a trust and sell his "honor."
The only way to shield him, to balk
the corruption which clinks alluring
gold, is to put into the hands of the
sometimes fooled but always unpur
chasable public the power of election
now concentrated in the hands of a few,
the majority of the few unworthy, the
minority in part morally weak and if
upright then numerically helpless.
There seems to be trouble, to the ex
tent of about two illustrated columns
daily, in the [Sloane family of New-
York. These domestic broils are always
saddening*, particularly when they get
so mixed up with "legitimate news that
sensible people in scanning the latter
cannot avoid getting a glimpse of them.
For my part Sloane and his wife' maÂ»
undisturbed throw the dishes at each
other, or in peace, run a race to the
divorce court. Their quarrel is as im
portant as that between the coachman
and the cook.

The pardon of ex-Cashier Flood was
not surprising. Indeed, ho stole so ably
and so much that the fact of his con

the case.

I freely confess to lack of admiration
for the medical students who decorated
a Christmas tree with the ghastly relics
of the dissecting room, the skulls of
babes, the half-fleshed hands of the
pauper subject, or between the grin
ning teeth of the desecrated dead set
ribald jests. It would appear that, by
ordinary effort a medical student
might cultivate the ways of decency,
and fail to find joy in being a brutal
buffoon.

Congressman-elect Boberts thinks
the possession of three wives does not
disqualify him for taking his seat, and
cites Abraham and others of similar
repute as a bolster to his way of living.
It does not appear to me that the po
lygamist's choice of models has been
fortunate. Abraham may have been a
worthy man in some respects, but so
far as I can learn these respects failed
to become of record. He certainly did
not deport himself toward his Sarah as
a gentleman should have done, and his
scheme for sticking a butcher knife
into his son does not win the approval
of the thoughtful despite its beauteous
effectiveness as a Sunday-school text.
I have always wondered at the ambi
tion to secure final refuge in Abraham's
bosom, as the experience would seem
to me to be one to avoid. However,
this is apart from the main issue. Bob
erts has been chosen by the people of
Utah, where women are voters. That
the choice was an insult to the nation
which made the mistake of supposing
the Mormons sincere in the avowed re
nunciation of objectionable tenets, that
it was even an Insult to Congress,
which is a body not easily , insulted,
there can be no question; and yet there
seems a probability that the nation and
Congress will have to swallow the af
front. If Utah is fit to be a State, it
is fit to choose its representatives, and
such disgrace as may be involved will
rest upon that commonwealth.

cide, a process effective as hanging, as
a means of restraining the individual,
but lacking in force as an example.
To some extent admiration seems to
have been withheld from the Corbin
scheme of clearing Santiago harbor of
mines by sending Into it a boat fortified
with baled hay. Whether a shell such
as would have sunk * a cruiser would
have glanced harmlessly from a fort
built of mule fodder is a matter which
may never be determined. I am of the
opinion that the fodder would have
been dissipa ed, the men behind it blown
to kingdom come and the hardship of
hunger visited upon the faithful mule.
However, a plain civilian has no right
to vaunt himself as to matters military.
I notice with regret the death of Mrs.
Elizabeth Mallon of New York, a bright
and brainy woman, whose work in the
Ladies' Home Journal it has been a
pleasure and a duty to excoriate.
Judged by the Bok standard, this work
was excellent, enough to condemn it
in the judgment of common sense. It.
was written over the signature "Ruth
Ashmore," and consisted of namby
pamby advice to milk-and-water girls,
reeked of piety and altogether was the
perfection of Bokanalian literature.
But as "Bab" Mrs. Mallon wrote reason
albeit with a tinge of wickedness. I
do not mean this in an invidious sense,
but simply that she displayed a knowl
edge of the world. To be able to as
sume two characters so distinct, in
each fulfilling the requirements, showed
Mrs. Mallon to be a person far above
the common. The hired writer, ordi
narily, must do that which the payer
of the hire requires. This is not always
easy, but the ability to adapt oneself
to the requirements of the moment is
the indication of genius. It shows,
moreover, that as a molder of public
opinion the writer is handicapped.
My entire sympathy is with General
Miles in his assaults upon the thrifty
gentlemen who sold the Government
rotten beef for the use of the soldiers
in Cuba. He should be court-martialed
for making complaint, and thus be en
abled to complete the expose. Con
tractors who- would be guilty of the
crime alleged ought to have their plants
confiscated, and themselves exiled to
the most distant Isle acquired during
the war, as traitors to the country.
A gentleman by name Crane, by pro
fession a preacher, and by intrinsic
character a thorn in the side of civili

ever, neglects to fortify himself by any

The Supervisors about to retire have
refused to do anything toward estop
ping burials in the city cemeteries. This
circumstance alone ought to be enough
to commend the plan. .The folly of try
ing to maintain a series of burying
grounds while the growth of the town
is pressing around and beyond them is
manifest to anybody who thinks. This
does not by any means imply that it is
manifest to a Supervisor. The ceme
tarhs are foredoomed to go, and the
delay, however brought about, will only
make more expensive the ultimate re
moval. A graveyard is not only a som
ber blot when in the center of popula
tion, but it is a menace to health and
a bar to progress. The reason for
opposing removal in the present in
stance is not deference to the dead,
but the selfish interests of the living,
and a small minority of the living at
that.

"B. H." Nobody that I know of has
been advocating the "doctrine" that
nations flourish, decline and die. That
statement is but the setting forth of
fact. As to whether or not the setting
forth is politic there may be diverse
opinions. Some people do shy at the
truth. However, as to this nation, we
can have the comfort that we as indi
viduals will decline and die first.
There were some features of the Bot
kin trial open to the criticism of any
equipped with mental faculties. The
abuse to which the witnesses for the
State were subject was without ex
cuse, and decency can make no plea for
it. To be a witness is not to be a
criminal. On the contrary, it is to per
form a duty required not alone by the
interests of justice, but by the specific
terms of the law. One having knowl
edge of a crime and concealing it be
comes an accessory and must bear a
measure of the guilt. Yet those who
responded to statutory summons and
threw such light as they could upon an
awful deed of murder were insulted by
the prisoner's attorneys, their reputa
tions assailed wantonly while they were
helpless before the gaping throng of
idlers and degenerates. Later, the in
sults were renewed. By what right
does a lawyer classify a working girl
who from necessity wears glasses as
"a goggle-eyed pot-walloper"? Where
Is the bravery in attacking an unpro
tected woman? There should be less of
such brutality. That a lawyer can be
a gentleman has been demonstrated,
but that some lawyers can't has been
made equally clear. Another feature
of the trial even more disgusting was
the presence day after day of a lot of
females delighting their morbid souls
with the offal from the sinks of in
iquity where the Botkin woman had
wallowr " and âhere they would wal
low had they the charms to attract
companionship. The poor things can't
well indulge their instincts without the
necessary Dunning, and so they sat;
and drooled at the relation of orgies
in which participation had been denied
them. Another variety was on hand
for the pleasure of seeing one of their
sex suffer. ; Every shot of accusation
which pierced the fatly fortified hide of
the prisoner was a joy to them. Every
allusion to the gallows, causing the
prisoner to doff her raiment of blithe
someness and wince, was to them a
separate boon, its coming greeted with
a knowing smile. The murder was hor
rible, each particle of direct testimony^
a jar to the senses, the levity of the
central figure disgusting, but the most
debased and debasing phase of the
event, the one "to excite the greatest
apprehension, loathing, creepiness, was
the throng of lewd and leering creat
ures scrambling for a chance to dabble
in filth and heartless as a band of
harpies. ________________

.1 . â - . ] trouble that had
â <$ â $ Â§ Â§â yâ t *â¢ been brewing for
some time between Captain Sureshot and
Mr. Saltedmines broke loose -with un
bridled fury. It is a well known fact that
Captain Sureshot, according to his state
ments, never missed anything but a train
in his life. When he was coming out to
California in *49, ho stated, he used to
kill two Indians at every shot. Finally
he got such a reputation that the redskins
refused to molest the emigrant train if
they knew that the captain was in it.
When the train would encamp for the
night the captain would take his rifle and
go out for a little game, and he says that
he never had to shoot. When the deer,
bear or quail would see him coming they
would deliver themselves up, .as they
knew that it was no use to try and es
cape. Of late the captain has been en
tertaining the club with stories of how
he taught Mr. Saltedmines to shoot when
the latter was his guest some years ago
in Southern California. Now it appears
that recently Mr. Saltedmines told of an
incident connected with his visit to Cap
tain Sureshot that the latter had forgot
ten to mention, and it .was. the following
story that caused the fatormy session of
the club last night: ' 'â¢ =* â¢ " oj
When Mr. Saltedmines was the cap
tain's guest he used to sit out on_the
porch in the afternoons, and while^the ,
captain was sleeping In the hammock he
would shoot at the squirrels, which were
very plentiful in the . trees that sur- ___
rounded the residence. It occurred to
him one day that he wanted to have
some fun with his host, so while the lat
ter was quietly snoozing he climbed a
tree and by the means of a wire fixed two
squirrels that he had killed securely to a
limb. Then he resumed his seat on the
porch and waited for the captain to
awake. When he did so Mr. Saltedmines
deftly turned the conversation to the de
sired subject, and called the captain's at
tention to the squirrels. They offered an j
excellent mark, and Captain Sureshot re
marked that one of them would never
know what had hit him. He picked up
the rifle and took a deliberate aim and
fired. The squirrel did not move. The
captain examined the rifle, then looked
at Mr. Saltedmines and then up at the
tree, where sat the squirrel perfectly un
disturbed.
"He knows you," said the captain's
guest, "and he is not afraid. So this Is
a sample of your marksmanship that you
have been bragging about!"
The captain let out a good full-grown
oath, and then he took a rest. Long, de
liberate and sure was his aim. He flred.
Again the two squirrels sat motionless on
the limb. In a few seconds the captain
had the air blue as indigo. Next he went
under the tree and still the squir
rels did not move. He shook his
hat at them, yelled and finally
threw a stone up the tree. The squirrels
never moved. By this time Captain Sure
shot was wild. He took off his coat and
climbed the tree. When he discovered
how* he had been victimized he came
down like a streak of lightning, but Mr.
Saltedmines had fled. That was ten
years ago. and yesterday the perpetrator
of the joke told it. When the captain
found It out he got on the warpath. As
soon as the club met he openly attacked
Mr. Saltedmines, whom he accused of .
violating the laws of the club, which pro
vide that while a member may lie his
soul into eternal perdition he must never
perpetrate a joke on any other member. .
President Highballs put the captain's mo
tion that Mr. Saltedmines be fined. It
was carried, and thus harmony was re
stored in the club. _

CAPTAIN GILLEN`S
NEW YEAR FREAK
. ' ' â¢â¢ â¢ : * * .-.'.
--lie Captures a Man of Mystery, Who
Is stuffed With Coin, vy,-
CAPTAIN' JAMES GILLEN of the Seventeenth street police station- has
in his keeping a genuine New Year's freak in the person .af a man who
was found sitting In a bicycle store on Valencia .street, between' Six
teenth ami Seventeenth, by Officer C. H. Taylor last night. at 10 o'clock.'
The man of mystery walked into the store and took- a seat as uncon
cernedly as if be owned the store. On being asked -by the proprietor what
no wanted he refused to answer. The officer was called in and he met with'
as little success as the proprietor. â¢ *
At the Seventeenth street station Captain Gillen had him searched, and
in an Inside pocket, safely secured by a half dozen safety pins,:- if as found a
wallet containing 1860 in gold notes of the denomination of tens and twen
ties, besides $4 Bo in silver. To all questions put to him he declined to an
swer until the captain coaxed him a little, when he gave a. few unsatisfac-'
lory answers, but not of such a nature as would satisfy a person that he
was sane. On being confronted with Prison-keeper White at the booking
desk he gave the name of George F. Bldmaier and said he was a polisher by
trade and that he was born in New- York and was aged M years.
Further than this he would not go. He declined to tell where he roomed
or wh*re he worked, or. in fact, anything, further regarding himself.
He. seemed conscious of the day of the month and of his surroundings, and
also gave ,he Information that he owed his landlady a month's rent to-day.
He had two keys or the Yale pattern with a tag numbered 'l6 attached.
Nothing rise that would lead to his Identity was found on his person.
He was detained at the station pending investigation by the police.

large area of ground and plant it with
grass. There will be landscape paintings
to delight the eye and a band In constant

to families and his resort will be a model
one in every respect. A beautiful entrance
has been constructed and the electric
lighting is furnished by three motors,
which also propel the horses from the
stopping place back to the starting point.
MILITARY BALL.
Knights of the Red Branch Rifles
Wind Up the Old Year.
The Knights of the Red Branch Rifles
gave their seventh annual military ball
last night at Odd Fellows' Hall, and the
affair was remarkably successsfui. Over
three hundred couples participated in the
grand march, which was led by Captain
T. J. Mellott and Miss Delia Curran. To
the "Echoes of Erin," the Knights, in
full-dress uniform, with their gayly at
tired ladled, began the dancing, which
lasted from 9 in the evening until 4 o'clock
this morning. There was an intermission
at midnight, during which the new year
was ushered iii with hearty good wishes
and many flowing bumpers.
The following are the names of those to
whom credit is due for the success of the
ball:

GRAND MASQUERADE BALL.
Arion Society's Benefit Fills Me
chanics' Pavilion.
The grand masquerade ball under the
auspices and for the benefit of the Arion
Benevolent Society in Mechanics' Pavil
ion last night was a success from a finan
cial qoint of view, notwithstanding the
fact that everybody in San Francisco ap
peared to be on the streets bidding good
by to the old year and welcoming the
new. i
The number of maskers was not so
large as on previous occasions of a simi
lar character, which is partly accounted
for by the fact that the majority of those
in attendance put in the early part of the
evening. parading the streets, tooting tin
horns and otherwise adding to the babel
of noise that made night hideous. Nev
ertheless there were devils and fairies,
goddesses of liberty, tough girls, female
impersonators,, walking Christmas trees,
Dutchmen, longshoremen and man o"
warsmen galore. Prizes wore distributed
to those having the handsomest and odd
est costumes, etc.
The hour of midnight was the signal
for unmasking and also for the inaugu
ration of a perfect pandemonium of nioso
in honor of the advent of the young and
unsophisticated New* Year. Soon after
midnight the people began to arrive in
droves and dancing, was kept up until
nearly daylight. The committee of ar
rangements consisted of Frank Dunn, j
chairman: Frank X. Foley, secretary,
and John C. Mi Bride, treasurer. Paul
A. Bender acted as floor manager.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 1, 1899.
GEORGE W. ROOT
REMEMBERED BY
HIS ASSOCIATES
His Gift a Diamond
Watch Charm.
_
BARKENTINES IN DISTRESS
CANNOT MAKE PORT IN TIME
FOR NEW YEAR'S DAY.
Captain ''Pete" Ott Did Not Get Back
on the Acapulco â Captain B.
Cogan Able to Be About
Again.
Chief Wharfinger George W. Root was
treated to an agreeable surprise
yesterday. The wharfingers and collec
tors on the front took advantage of his
retirement from office to assume the du
ties of Clerk of the Supreme Court to
present him with a magnificent watch
charm. During his term of office the
chief has always been most considerate
of his subordinates, so they could not let
him depart from among them without
some token of their esteem.
The old waiting-room of the Sausalito
| ferry was used for the occasion. "The
boys" had draped it with flags and dec
orated it with evergreens, while a plat
form had been erected at the easterly end
of the room. Chief Root was about to
take the ferry boat for Oakland when
Sergeant "Tom" Mahoney of the Harbor
Police took possession of him, and saying,
"You are wanted badly to straighten out
a dis lrbance on Clay street wharf,"
marched him away. In vain the chief
[ protested that he had to catch a boat.
Mahoney would take no denial. When he
I was ushered into the room there were
present all the employes of the Harbor
Commission and many of the prominent
business men on the front. After a few
opening remarks, by Captain W. R. Leale
the presentation' was made by Assistant
Chief Wharfinger Scott. He told of the
pleasant relations that had always ex
ist! between Chief Root and the men
under him and wished him as much suc
cess is his new office as ho had had dur
ing his charge of the water front.
Speeches were made by Dan T. Cole,
T. 8.. O'Brien, A. E. Pryor and others,
after, which a cold collation was spread
and the health of the new Clerk of the
Supreme Court was drank with three
times three. The charm presented is In
the form of a Masonic emblem, the center
piece of which is a four-carat diamond.
Mr. Root was completely overcome by
the goodwill shown him, and had some
difficulty in thanking "the boys" for their J
kindly remembrance of him. .
Barkentines seem to be in hard luck.
The S. >,'. Wilder from Honolulu, the Tarn â 
o' Shanter from Willapa and the Gleaner I
from the Columbia River, have been off !
the. heads since last Thursday night and j
cannot make port. Friday they were in
a bunch fourteen miles south-southwest
. of Point Lobes, while yesterday they had |
got to within three miles of the Golden
Gate when they' had to anchor. Late in j
j the evening the Tana o- Shanter took a
' tow, but it looks as" though the crews of
I the others would spend New Year's day
i at sea bat within sight of home.
The bar"_entine Omega was also outside,
but Captain Harrington managed to get
her past the fort. Then the tide turned
and she began to drift out to sea again,
but the anchors were dropped and , the
vessel-hung there until wind â¢ and ".tide
once more suited, when she made the
upper bay. The schooner Volunteer, sev
enty. days from Caleta .Buena, had also
to anchor outside, but a tug came along
and brought her -.in. Captain. Harrington
of the .Omega report? that .on December
21. In latitude (5 deg. 16 mm. north, longi
tude 127 deg. 30 niin. west, he passed a
lot of flooring, planking, fencing and
laths. â¢ This is probably the deck-load of
some lumber Vessel that was caught in
the recent northwester.
The steamer Acapulco arrived from
Panama and way ports' yesterday with
out Captain "Pete" Ott, the pilot, who
was carried away on the City of Para.
It was thought the two steamers might
meet off Point Conception, and in that
event Captain Ott would have been trans
ferred. The pilots are now building their
hopes on the City of Para reaching Maz
atlan in time to connect with the Cura
cao, in which event Captain Ott will come .
back on that vessel. ?;*'*â¢?. * .
â¢Word 'was received by the Merchants
Exchange yesterday that the British ship
Glenard.from South Shields for San Fran
cisco with a general cargo, had gone
ashore at Dungeness in a heavy storm.
A lifeboat was standing by ready to take
off the crew in case of an emergency.
Captain B. Cogan has left. St. Marys
Hospital and' in a day or so will be out
and about again. His wife wished him
to remain another week at St. Mary
and was getting ready to cross the bay
to persuade him to remain. When th*- Cap
tain walked into the house. He had to
undergo a very painful surgical opera
tion, but is now on the high, road to re
covery and will be ready for another
cruise -to 'the Arctic in a few' weeks.

The parochial school of St.-*' Rose's par- j

i 'people for whom it was built. A.-? will
be remembered, the great lire of 1593 de
stroyed every vestige of church property
belonging .to St. Rose's Church, Including
j the church itself. From that day' to this
the clergy,- assisted" by the -parishioners
and the charitably inclined In other sec
i tions of the city, has been engaged in the
work of restoring the parish buildings.
' Two days after the Area shed was. has- j
tlly erected to serve as a place of wor
ship. Work was- immediately furthered
'to erect a home for the clergy, who had
been Compelled to take * rooms' in St.
Mary's Hospital.- A handsome dwelling
was' finished In the course of time. Tn â¢
present imposing church .of St. Rose was
read for dedication two years -ago. The
'grammar school of the parish remained
vet 'unbuilt.

been fulfilled, arid St. Rose's school will '
open .its .doors, with aproprlate core.

The church property extends from Bran
nan' street* through .to Freelon. The
â¢church and residence face on Brannan
[street. The school fronts 15 feet on Free
lon street. The school building Is modern
In every particular. -There is no attempt
at exterior ornament; ip fact,' the archi
tect', .has followed the lines of the old
school very closeJv, and has. aimed at clas
sic solidity rather than decoration in ef
fect. The building rises three stories over
a very high and lightsome brick base
ment. The basement is floored 'and lighted
to serve as a- covered â¢ playground oil
rainy days Two broad staircases load
from' the arched entrances to the landings
.on the 'first floor. These entrances serve
for the boys and girls respectively. There
are eight large 'classrooms, so placed as
to' use light all day to the best advan
tage. The 'receiving classes,- primary
grades and principal's office are located
on- the first floor. The. purely grammar
grades occupy the second floor, and the
third floor is almost entirely occupied by
the exhibition hall, which Is a model of its
kind. The graining throughout the build
ing* is oak. .The school furniture, of mod
ern styles,- is â¢of ash and oak. The black
boards are of the. latest patent composi

everything is of the latest and best.
The school will be in charge of the Sis

had supervision of the St. Ross's gram
mar school, destroyed-' by the fire, and
had brought it to a high grade of ex
cellence. The pupils since that time have
attended other schools in the vicinity,. hut
as large a number will attend Monday
morning. ,-"â >
The work of rebuilding and restoring
the church, residence and school is now,
after three years, brought to completion,
it has cost an enormous amount of
money. A large bequest from the es
tate of Ellen Gallagher was the beginning.
The parishioners of St. Rose, have done
the rest. They are all hard-working peo
ple with small Incomes, yet they have
cheerfully co-operated in this almost
giant work, giving whatever their means
would allow to make the parish even more
complete than It was before the fire. That
work is now done I and the people who
have made It so deserve congratulation.
Only a debt* of some few thousands re
mains, but Father Nugent, the pastor,
has every assurance that it will be paid
in the near future.

BEST SERVICE
EVER OFFERED
Three Thousand Miles of Private
Leased Wire to Furnish Eastern
Market Reports.
PERFECT SERVICE ALSO SUP
PLIED TO INTERIOR CITIES.
Three thousand miles of wire is a
long stretch but this is the actual dis
tance of wire used by the Western Un
ion Telegraph Company to furnish the
New York stock market to brokers and
dealers in San Francisco. It seems
hardly possible for the outside world
to comprehend, nevertheless It is a fact.
The quotations of prices of the leading
stocks are posted in San Francisco as
soon as they occur in New York. This
is also true of all the changes in mar
ket price of wheat, corn, oats, pork,
etc., traded in on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Thirty seconds after the bell
taps for the opening of the Chicago
Board of Trade the prices are recorded
in San Francisco. It is, of course, a
very expensive undertaking, consider
ing the telegraph tolls. Douglas & Co.
of 20 Leidesdorff street are the only
subscribers to the Western Union ser
vice in San Francisco in tins particu
lar line. They also have their own
leased wires, used exclusively by their
correspondents at Sacramento, Grass
Valley, Woodland, Stockton, Merced,
Fresno, Hanford, Napa, San Jose, Val
lejo and J. S. Purdy, 45 Sutter street.
The several different cities use exclu
sively the leased wire system of Doug
las & Co.
The San Francisco stock mark.it has
for years been stagnant, and stocks
that some years ago were quoted *in
the thousands are now selling on an ay
: erage of 30 cents per share. Still those
same stocks are carried by people
who live in hopes of a revival or* the
mining industry. With poor chances
for an improvement, assessments come
with regularity and are paid by t.iiw
who still hope for some change for the
better. The range in prices dany is
from 1 cent to 25 cents, 'while the range
in prices In New York stocks is from
$1 to $6 or $10* per share daily.
To illustrate the facility of making a
turn in sugar and tobacco shares, the
man who bought American Sugar on
October 13 at 109, and sold on Decem
ber 10 at 135%, would be 2614 ahearf;
that is to say, if he had bought 100
shares he would have made $2S2 r > with
an investment of $100 or on ten shares
he would, with an investment of $10,
have cleared $262 50. Again, American
Tobacco on October 13 was quoted at
118*4. and on December 10 at 142* 4 . a
rise of 24 points. The investor to the
extent of $100 in 100 shares would thus
have made $2400 clear profit in two
months, or $240 if he bought ten shares,
investing $10, and held them for the
same period of time.
On December 19 Sugar fluctuated
nearly $4 per share; American Tobacco
nearly $2. On December 20 Sugar fluc
tuated $4 50 per share, while Tobacco
changed $2, and on December 21 both
of these leaders changed $2 per share.
Six months ago St. Paul stock was sell
ing for $98 f per share; to-day the same
stock is selling for $118' per share, an
advance of $20 per share. Rock Island
stock in the game space of time has ad
vanced from $95 to $111.. The same can
be said <â¢"' all the list, only some stocks
have advanced $50 and $60 per share.
It. of course, does not very often hap
pen that a trader can be fortunate
enough to get in on the low point and
out on' the high point, but for the last
six months it has been possible, and has
c-ccurred where lucky investors have
taken from $20 to $30 per share profit.
Douglas & Co.. an old-established East
ern house, have their office fitted up
with all the facilities necessary for cus
tomers to ascertain the exact prices of
the leading stocks in New York and
juices on Chicago Board of Trade. The
Quotations are posted* the instant they
are received over the fast overland
wires Of the Western-Union Telegraph
Company. Those interested will find
on inquiry that this firm has financial
standing, and. being established six
teen years in Chicago, must necessaslly
be a successful business house. Their
references are the best, and the patrons
of the firm on the coast can satisfy
others who wish to Intrust their busi
ness to this firm.
This firm offer at no time any ad
vice as' to the course of the market.

ENGLISH GIRLS' GAMES.
They Play Almost Everything Ex
% / 4,7: cept ' Football.
An attempt, very properly squashed,
was made to introduce football as a
game for -women. It was seen to be
a most unlikely and impossible pastime
for them, and though a team of brawny
ladies persevered in their course for a
season or so through the country,
laughter and derision were their man
guerdons, and the rest of their sex held
themselves severely aloof from follow

At the women's colleges and schools
hockey is becoming more and more the
favorite winter pastime. The Royal
Holloway College team is famous, and
plays in its own splendid field every
afternoon this term and next. The
students engage in games against the
Oxford and Cambridge women's col
leges, but they do not play golf at all.
Neither' do they boat seriously. The
Thames is quite half an hour's walk
from the college, and time is precious,
so, though they hire when they want
boats, there is not one now appertain
ing to the college. But they swim in
the glorious bath in their equally glori
ous grounds, and are ardent cyclists.
Many of the high school girls in Lon
don proceed to Neasden and other out
lying fields near London for their
hockey, possessing no facilities in town
for such exercise. At aristocratic Gir
ton â the first women's college estab
lished at either of* the Varsities â
have golf links of the.-- own. as well
as a hockey field. They also indulge in
a little mild cricket, during the sum
mer term, and constantly' meet -â¢.ewn
ham in open contest, or join- with that
abode of learning to meet the Oxford
women's colleges at hockey matches.
At Somerville Hall, Oxford, there is a
regular summer term institution on
Saturday afternoons of tennis and lem
onade, to which brother undergradu
ates of the "sweet girls" are invited.
Asphalt courts are played on vigorous
ly during the winter at Lady Margaret
Hall, Oxford, where there are also col
lege boats, the vicinity of the river
Cherwell rendering boating possible.
Golf and the new fashioned game of
croquet are regarded by damsels *f 17
as slow and frumpish. But when they
arrive at years of discretion they ad
mit that there is something in both, and
that they are "jolly difficult" to play
well. Croquet does not flourish much,
therefore, in scholastic realms, though
its vogue has Increased a hundredfold
during the past summer in other cir
cles. " .
Gymnasium work and dancing are
both extremely popular among school
girls, and college ones also. At Hollo
way College there Is a superb floor in
the long galleries devoted to library
purposes, and here sometimes the stu
dents are permitted to trip it gayly.
Fencing is another exercise to which
women are becoming more and more
devoted, but it does not seem to appeal
to the women's colleges yet. It is pop
. ular in art circles, for it has more than
a flavor of Paris about It, and, besides,
| is most advantageous to those whose
occupations are sedentary. Literary

Anthony Trollope's Fun.
Mr. Trollope's big voice drowned every'
one else as he chaffed my father down the
length of the dinner table. He had jested
over golf. (John Blackwood was a devo
tee, and attained to being captain of the
St. Andrew's club), what would he not do
next? He used to make daring assaults
upon the most cherished article of the
Blackwood faith. Blind, unswerving de
votion to the sovereign was one of his
favorite points of attack. "Now, Black
wood, how could the death of the sov
ereign possibly affect you?/' he would say.
"If you heard of it to-morrow morning
you know perfectly well "you would eat
.hist as good a breakfastâ would- not
even deny yourself that second kidney."
it was in vain to protest that in face of
such a calamity, the very thought of
broiled kidneys would Be distasteful
Mr. Trollope bore everything before him
and prepared for another attack.
The Conservative party and Dizzy were
a tempting subject for a tilt. "You know,
Blackwood, you know you think exactly
about Dizzy as' 1 do; you know you would
be very glad to hear he had been had up
"forâ for shoplifting." Tableau! all hold
ing up their hands and Mr. Trollope de

HOW TO GET CLOTHES MENDED.
"It is strange that I can't get my wife
j to mend my clothes." remarked Mr. j Bri
i dle, In a tone of disgust. "I asked her to
sew a button this vest this morning, and
she hasn't touched it."
"You asked her!" said Mr. Norris, with
a slight shrug of his shoulders.
"Yes. "What else should I do?"
"You haven't been married very' long,
so perhaps you'll take a tip from me,"
answered Mr. Norris, with a fatherly air.
Never ask a woman to mend anythingâ
that's fatal."
"Why, what do you mean?"
"Do as I do. When I want* a shirt
mended for instance. I take it in my hand *
and hunt up my wife. 'Where's the rag

voice. -'. 'â¢ .-..'â¢â¢;
" 'What do you want a ragbag for?' she
says, suspiciously.
" 'I want to throw this shirt away; it's

'No. my dear,' I answer: 'there is no use

CRISIS IN THE
GERMAN CABINET
IS APPROACHING
Emperor and Chan
cellor at Outs.
EXPULSION OF THE DANES
CAUSES HOHENLOHE TO OPPOSE
WILLIAM'S POLICY.
Baron yon Koeller, Governor of
Schleswig - Holstein, Is Re
sponsible for the Ob
noxious System.
â .
' Copyrighted, IS9B, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Dec. 31.â From 'an. Inside
source it is learned that another Cabi
net crisis here is approaching. For
some time there have been serious dif
ferences of opinion between Emperor
William and the Imperial Chancellor,
Prince Hohenlohe, in two instances,
the question of the highest military
court and the Lippe-Detmold succes
sion case, his Majesty yielded, to some
extent, to the views of Prince Hohen
lohe. This, however, was done more
because of the Emperor's affection for
the head Chancellor, whom he calls
"uncle" in private conversaton and ad
esses by the r> f."ectonate (thou),
than because Prnce Hohenlohe's views
convinced him.
In several other equally important
matters the Prince's view and inten
tions have been over-ridden by the Em
peror and part of the Cabinet, more es
pecially by Dr. Miquel, the vice-presi
dent of the Council of Ministers and
Minister of Finance, the anti-strike bill,
the refusal to sanction the bill to ex
tend the right of political association
and the expulsions 6*" Danes and Aus
trians from Germany being instances of
this.
' Prince Hohenlohe particularly disap
proved of the expulsion of Danes from
North Schleswig as barbarous, Impolitic
and less, but they were approved by
the Emperor and the Chancellor. Al
though he has taken pains to not show
the disapproval of these rules, has
yielded thus far to his Majesty's views.
The consequences of these ceaseless ex
pulsions, which were continued this
â¢ week, have been to greatly embarrass
him, especially in the case of German
"relations with Austria, and induced the
Chancellor to address the Emperor a
long autograph letter this week, set
ting forth in detail the reasons why
he disapproved of the expulsions, and
why, if the home and foreign' policy he
has hitherto followed in agreement
with Emperor William is to be pursued,
it will be necessary to discontinue the
expulsions. His Majesty thus far has
, not" replied to this letter, but he is ex
pected to do so verbally early ' next
week or ; soon after Prince Hohenlohe's
'return to Berlin. . "â¢. .
, Baron yon Koeller, the .reactionary
ex-Minister of the Interior and Gov
ernor of Schleswig-HolÃtein, is mainly
responsible for the system of expul
sions. He is a bitter enemy of Prince
Hohenlohe, to whom he attributes his
downfall a couple of years ago. The
situation thus created is one in which
â¢he chancellor considers he ctoinot with
heif-respect father the policy of the
empire unless the Emperor "himself
tails a halt, which those surrounding
him do not believe he will do. There
Is a powerful clique working insidi
ously with the aim of rendering the
situation more acute and forcing Prince
Hohenloe'6 retirement, when they be
neve an out-and-out reactionary cab
inet will be formed with the reappear
ance of Baron yon Zedlitz in a high po
rtion, after a disappearance from pub
lic during seven years past and at the
direct command of his majesty;.."?
7 It is adduced in support of this be- j
lief that Government circles will give j
an explanation of the Emperor'! 1 con- j
currence In Baron yon Koeller's "whole- I
sale expulsions in North Bchleswig,
that the political situation there had
been for some time much worse than is !
publicly known and that the network I
of pro-Danish conspiracy had to be !
forcibly uprooted in order to guarantee !
.the security of the country, arid it is i
â further asserted that the Prussian Gov
ernment will advance evidence of this;
conspiracy.
But, in spite of this, all private re- I
ports, newspaper reports and individual j
j reports, agree in pointing out that the
' situation prior to th*:- expulsion was
harmless.
â Â° The expulsion of the Danes is already
doing considerable harm, to German
â¢ trade, and in Germany exporters are
bitterly complaining and are trying to j
conci :..â¢â¢ their Danish customers. Two
-well-known Berlin exporting firms have
sent an open letter to their Danish]
.â¢" clients, which illustrates the feeling of j
the commercial classes here. The let
ter says: "In view of the excited state
â¢ of feeling produced among the Danish'
people by the measures of the Prussian
Government, we beg to point out that 5
in wide circles among the Germans this
excitement is considered perfectly jus- ;
tifiable. Together with our friends and
the majority of the German nation, we
â shall leave nothing undone to endeavor
| to bring about a repeal of the present
â severe measures. In the meanwhile we ,
beg you to use your utmost efforts, to
induce the Dar.i*h people not to trans- â 
fer to the German nation their resent
ment against the Prussian â¢ Govern- i
ment." - 7-7--"
â¢ A" significant fact this week was the
- conversion of the Kreuz Zeitung to pro-
American views, which is understood to
, have been due to the direct interference i
of the Government. The Kruez Zel
tunsr, which as the leading organ of the
Conservative party, exerting vast influ
ence in court, official and army circles,
has tended all along to maintain the
spirit of unfriendliness toward the Uni- ,
ted States, has now suddenly, with- '
out giving any reason tor its change of
opinion, become a powerful advocate!
of better and more intimate political
and commercial relations between the
two countries. In a long and carefully j
worded editorial the Kreuz Zeitung for
the first time does justice to American
valor during the recent war with Spain,
pointing out how a good understand- -
Ing In many ways is desirable, and ex- j
pressing the fervent hope that such an
arrangement will be arrived at and
both nations will appreciate each other
better. li also reviews the present for
eign policy of the United Stales and !
says it sees no reason why it should
not receive Germany's support. Speak
ing of the commercial negotiations be- i
tween Germany and the United -States]
the Kreuz Zeitung predicts that a way i
will be found to reconcile the interests ;
of both countrise in, a reciprocal treaty. j
The correspondent here of the Asso
ciated Press has had several conver
sations on the subject with officials of
the German Foreign Office this week.
One Of his Informants outlined the
views of the German Government re- i
specting the commercial negotiations at
"Washington, particularly, emphasizing
the opinion that the United States is j
more interested in securing reciprocal j

A FAMOUS INSTITUTION.
The Old and Favorably Known Santa
Clara College.
The Santa Clara College, located in
j the town of the name it bears, is one
of the most celebrated secular institu
tions of learning in California. It was
established by the fathers of the So
! ciety of Jesus on March 19, 1851, and
! was chartered on April 28, 1855, with all
j the rights and privileges of a univer
sity. It has made rapid strides since
that time and many men notable in
the history of California are graduates
therefrom.
The college is admirably located and
is justly celebrated for the beauty of
its surrounding scenery and the mild
ness and salubrity of climate. It is
easily accessible by rail, it being lo
cated on the lines of the Southern Pa
cific and South Pacific Coast railways.
The college, buildings are extensive
: and admirably adapted for the purpose
to which they are devoted. In the
' past few years extensive improvements
, were made and there are now seven
| -large buildings, besides, others of less
Importance, enclosed in a quadrangle
'of nearly ten acres. With most com
i plete and appropriate accommodations
; in every department and a full staff of
professors, this institution presents
['. uncommon advantages for the moral,
' mental and physical training of young
men and boys.
Among the studies taught are Greek,
Latin, English, elocution, mental phil
-1 osophy, natural sciences, mathematics,
i arithmetic, bookkeeping, history, geog
raphy, modern languages. and the fine
arts. The equipments of. the Institu

"CURRENCY
REFORM" IS
THE SUBJECT
Comptroller Dawes'
Address.
LEGISLATION IS REVIEWED
[RECOMMENDATIONS OF ' THE
PRESIDENT APPROVED.
Means by Which the United States
Government May /Be Enabled "
to Check the "Endless 'â¢
' ; : Chain" System.
*
..Special. Dispatch to The Call. .
' CHICAGO, Dec. 31â The Hon. Charles
G. Dawes, Comptroller of the Currency,
was the guest of the Commercial Club
this evening' and delivered an address
on "Currency Reform." He. said *in
part: 'â  7*'
"At the election of 1896 the chief Issue.,
before the American people for settle
ment was that of the maintenance of
the gold standard and a sound gov
ernmental currency. * The commercial'
crisis of 1893 with the consequent re
duction in Governmental revenues had
developed an inherent weakness in our
present monetary system, which before
that time had been latent. This weak
ness was largely due to two causes;
first, the disproportion existing between
demand governmental currency liabili
ties and thÂ« gold held by the treasury
for their redemption; second, the fact
that these demand currency liabilities,
like greenbacks, being once redeemed
in gold, could be paid out again for
government expenses, thus making pos
sible a further presentation for gold re
demption, and creating what has be
come, commonly known as the 'endless
chain?"
"As pointed out in the Presidents
last message the proportion of net gold
holdings to demand currency liabilities
of the treasury November 1, 1898, was
25.35 per cent, as compared with 16.96
per cent on November 1, 1897. Recog
nizing these conditions the President in
his last annual message to Congress
makes a recommendation which, if
enacted into law, would break the end
less chain and still further strengthen
the condition of governmental cur
rency already so greatly improved by
the treasury operations of the last year.
His words are as follows: 'In my judg
ment the present condition of the treas
ury amply justifies the immediate
enactment of legislation recommended
one year ago, under which a portion of
the gold holdings should be placed in
a trust fund from which greenbacks
should be redeemed upon presentation,
but when once redeemed should not
thereafter be paid out except for gold.*
"This is the interpretation placed by
the President of the United States upon
the nature, of the demand of the people
in 1896 for monetary reform;, and while
not denying, as his message shows, the
necessity of other legislation, which nt
leaves to the wisdom of Congress, he
strongly urges its enactment into. law.
"To press the consideration of other
proposed remedies at this time will
prove a hindrance and obstruction to
the adoption of this recommendation
Which is plainly a step in advance.
After this recommendation is enacted
into law those who have what seems
to them a more complete remedy can
then present it for consideration. There
are many sincere and able men who
maintain that the Government can, to
Its own advantage and for the common
good, avail itself indirectly of the note
issuing function of national banks.
They believe that this can be accom
plished by removing the present re
striction required as security for bank
notes, the specific deposit of Govern
ment bonds, so that the banks will as
sume the burden of gold redemption of
Government notes in order to secure
the profit from the issuing of bank cir
culation to take their place.
"It must be remembered, however,
that the' present condition of the reve
nues, finances and credit of our Govern
ment clearly indicate that there is no
excuse to be found in governmental
necessities for any legislation which
would be unwise if the interests of the
people and business community alone
were considered. If the improvement in
governmental currency could not be se
cured except by a radical change in
banknote currency there would be
ground for a demand for the concur
rent consideration of governmental and
banking currency legislation. But when
the improvement of governmental cur
rency is possible otherwise the chances
for it should not be jeopardized by the
refusal of the advocates of bank-asset
currency to present their case upon its
own merits alone. At present among
those who favor a system of banknotes
secured by the commercial assets of
banks there does not seem to be that
definite agreement upon and acceptance
of terms which will enable any of these
plans to receive even the united sup
port of those who believe in th* prac
ticability under our banking system of
bank-asset currency. Some of the plans
of one year ago differ from those advo
cated to-day. The two bills having their
source in the House Committee on
Banking and Currency differ materially
from each other and neither commands
the united support of that committee.
"Each of these bills differs from other
plans suggested. Evidently time must
elapse before even the friends of this
particular kind of currency can be
united on a measure. I maintain that
the fundamental proposition which un
derlies all present bills providing for
bank currency without Government
bonds as security, namely, the prefer
ence of the note holder over the de
positor in'the distribution of the assets
of an insolvent bank, would work a
grave injustice upon the depositor class
of the country, with results in the high
est degree injurious to the whole com
munity.
"If the preference of the. bank-asset
note holder over the depositor provided
for by pending plans be decided unjust
and impracticable and an additional tax
upon circulation be proposed to remove
this Injustice, new elements of uncer
tainty are Introduced and the question
must also be discussed, whether, in new
estimates of the tax upon solvent par
ticipating banks necessary to make up
the losses on the notes, we have any
right to assume that all or a large pro
portion of the sound banks will go Into
the uncovered note-issuing, business;
and if only a few banks issue notes how
we could prevent that few from being
the smallest and weakest banks in the
system; and how, if a few banks and
weak banks only Issue notes at first
the tax on such circulation* to make
up losses can be held down so as to
Invite that general participation in as
set-note issuing by sound banks for
purposes of profit, which would be es
sential to the absolute safety of the
notes. ' *â¢.-'./â â '?'

Fortunately for the country and for its
business and commercial interests the
discussion and settlement of all these
vexed and complicated problems need
not stand in the way of true govern
mental currency reform as outlined in
the two annual messages of the Presi
dent of the United States. In the minds
of the people of the country the issue
of 1896 was not the reform of our pres
ent banknote currency, but the refor
mation of governmental currency. - I
believe that the people and the busi
ness interests of this country demand
that whatever changes are made in our
currency system to break the endless
chain and insure the safety of the gold
standard should, if possible, be simple'
and easily understood. They are not
now', nor. have they been in favor of
complicated or radical changes. As they
desire stability in" the tariff -system, so
they desire stability in the currency
system. While they want improvement

the effect that Mr. Brandon" will have
no opponent.
No such harmony .'exists, however in
regard to the position of sergeant at
arms of the Senate. The fight is on at
present between Mike Smith of San
Francisco and Lou Martin, a Southern

night that there will be a joint caucus
of the Republican majority to-morrow
afternoon for the purpose of discussing
patronage matters necessary to the or

The prevailing opinion is that no

perhaps, a determination of the amount

The naming of the attaches will be

The appointment of these gentlemen was
a disappointment to Collector Jackson and
his ally. Mr. Wise. Mr. Wise insisted all
along that Collector Jackson should be
(designated as the investigating officer to
handle cat only the charges against
Moore, but those against Meredith as
well, but Assistant Secretary Howell
found so much discrepancy between t..e
statements of Jackson and Wise and the
report of Major Moore oa the matter of
the escape of Fong Suey Wan, through
the apparent connivance of Chief Mere
dith, that he did not consider that Col
lector Jackson would go into the inquiry
with that cold, calm, judicial mind which
Is the ideal of the searcher after truth.
Fcr instance. Wise said in Washington
that before he left San Francisco Col
lector Jackson had lr.fornfed him that the
.Chinese Burean had let Fong Suey Wan
Igo because Miss Cameron of the Chinese
Presbyterian Home Mission and Assist
ant United States Attorney Bert Scfaies-
Inger had pleaded with Major Moore and
the others that the poor woman should
be allowed to go. Collector-Jackson has
denied that he told Wise anything* of the
kind and that nothing of the kind had
taker place.. But Mr. Wise's recklessness
ln making statements and the . fact that
he stood by Boodler Dick Williams to the
last, just as Jackson is standing by Mere
-"dtth, have induced Assistant Secretary
Howell to select a special -.-â¢J of Spe
cial Agents to try both Major. Moore and
the Chinese Bureau. Another considera
tion which 'had much weight' with Mr.
Howell was the fact that Jackson is the
head of the Chinese Bureau, ahd as such
is responsible for its management and for
the acts of his appointee. * jtience however

-that he might as well give up its at -

Meredith's denial of anything that may
be charged against him. however, will not
go for much, for he has denied the truth
more than once, the most conspicuous in
stance being the denial of the fact that
a reporter had warned him of the expect
ed escape of Fong Suey Wan. â  Meredith
was forced to withdraw his denial on
that occasion and he will be forced to
withdraw his denial of the Gavan inter
view as well.
This has not been & good year for the
forces of Collector Jackson. Every fight
he has made has been a losing one. He
.worked for months In the endeavor to
have Colonel Irish removed from the of
.fire of Naval Officer and to have Colonel
.'â¢"Billy"' Hamilton appointed in his place.
â '"*3ut President McKinley said that he did
t>ot nropose to remove Irish and that
Colonel Hamilton should be satisfied with

'" The next body blow that the Collector
'received was the appointment by the Sec

a full-fledged Chinese inspector. It had
been stated by Meredith and his friend 3
that Dr. Gardiner was a pig-headed
.zealot and that he and Major Moore and
the reporters, of all the San Francisco
â  daily papers were In conspiracy to ruin
him (-Meredith), and Gardiner's appoint

"CANNED FREEDOM" FOR FILIPINOS
The Long Predicted Wave of Prosperity Now
Coming In and of Great Volume.
E. S. Pillsbury, who has lately returned from the East, was seen at his offic*
by a Call reporter yesterday and questioned about the business and political
situation there. Mr. Pillsbury did not at first take very kindly to being inter
viewed, though he declared. In a slightly sarcastic tone, that as ha had been
away a month he naturally had nothing in particular to do. He described the
business conditions throughout the East as most promising; said that the wave of
prosperity so long looked for and predicted was now coming in and of great
volume. That this improvement not only applied to railroad stocks and bonds,
and securities of that character, but as well to the iron and steel industries and
other great industrial interests. That confidence was fully restored, trade was
active â¢-nd Increasing, money abundant and ail other conditions favorable for a
long period of good times. Being asked when the better times would reach
California, he insisted that they were here already: that the last year had been
the best for business men in .San Francisco since 135:2. and but for the drought
the whole State would have, participated In the improved condition of af
fairs, and rain is now only needed for the coming year to insure a turn for the
better to all.
As to the Philippine question, he said there was nothing to discuss; this Is
sue was settle^; there was no use looking backward. While many of us might
deprecate the necessity of the war and regret tbat the occupation of the Phil
ippines became necessary as a war measure, we must accept the situation
as it now is. The treaty would be ratified by the Senate, and many questions
were likely to arise in the near future which would require the exercise of tne
highest statesmanship on our part. "This is a good thing," he continued. "The
money question is settled, also that of the tariff for some time to come, and It is
we:; for the people to have their thoughts turned to our cardinal principles
of government and how they shall be worked out in view of the new complica
tions which face us." To an inquiry about the reported purchase of the Phil
ippines by Japan, he declared It was all newspaper nonsense. "Japan has no
$250.'XX),iX)<J for any such purpose, being already strained to keep up Its military
footing and creating a fine deficit every year on that account. No, sir." he said,
with some emphasis, "'our flag has been raised in the Philippines and It is not
going to be hauled down. We shall maintain an army adequate to the demands
of our changed conditions. Our immense foreign trade will eventually be car
ried in our own ships, and we shall have a navy sufficient to protect that com
merce. To the suggestion that a portion of the inhabitants were objectionable,
he replied. 'Not more so than the Apache Indians, whom we took along with
Arizona and New Mexico." But it was suggested there was an insurgent party
there to treat with, which he denied, claiming that . Spain was exercising sover
eignty over the whole archipelago when Dewey carried the war there. "We have
obtained those islands by a treaty with Spain, by which the sovereignty Is to
be transferred to us; the result is * the same as when we acquired that
of Louisiana, Florida, Alaska and California, for that matter. Suppose, a Span
ish Governor here had Been defying the Government of Mexico when we ac
quired the country by the treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo, or an Indian chief had
laid claim to some of the territory of Alaska at the time it was purchased from
Russia. .1 fancy we wouia have made short work of such pretensions. We ar-*
going to govern the Philippines as w# think best, and we have the right, and it
Is our duty to do so. We will not only supply them with 'canned freedom,' as
suggested by Speaker Reed, but also with other commodities of a material and
substantial character. There can be no doubt but that California will be greatly
benefited by the acquisition of the Hawaiian Islands and the Philippines. We "are
no longer at the junplng-off place, but nearer the center of gravity, and our trade
must be greatly augmented." To the query whether those people were
capable of self-government, he suggested that was something to be determined
In the light of future events, and added that with such an object lesson before
them as the present contest for United States Senator in this State there could
be no doubt as to the ultimate result; besides. it would be a fine place to send
some of our surplus politicians.' Mr. rillsbury admitted that the sentiment in New
England was somewhat divided on the question of expansion, but Insisted that
the West and South favored It quite unanimously, that the great body of the
Republican party was in accord with the Administration, and the whole subject
would be worked out harmoniously, and successfully.

SITE LOSES FIRST â¢ FQINT*
The- Mine Owner Must Pay .'the" In
?â¢ â¢ dian Woman Alimony.
John R. Hite,- the wealthy owner of the
Hite' mine in Mariposa County, has- re
ceived his first setback in the divorce case
in which the. Indian . woman, Lucy Hite,
figures as the plaintiff. The Supreme
Court has affirmed, the order of the lower
court allowing alimony and counsel fees
to the woman.
This is destined to be one -of the famous
divorce cases" of the. State. As the story
goes, Hite was a poor prospector and had
but little luck. in his -line of occupation
until he met the Indian woman. It is said
that on account of some kindness -.shown*
by the man .to the Indian .woman* she
led him to the gold ledge that "has since
turned out to be ope of the richest min
ing properties in the southern part of the
State. He and the woman lived together
for years, -and she was known as Mrs.
Hite. To them a son was born and the
family prospered.
A year or so ago the old- miner, tired of
his Indian companion, and -having plenty
or money decided to take unto himself as
a wife a maiden of his own color. He
was fortunate in getting the consent of
a young woman in Oakland, one who had
been well reared and cared for. This
brought the Indian woman, Lucy, to the
front with a divorce suit and a demand
for her share of the community- property.
Being In need of money with which to
carry on the proceedings, she asked the
court to grant her alimony and counsel
fees. To this Hite objected, taking tne
position 'that the plaintiff was not his
wife, but the* court granted the woman's
request.
From this Hite appealed to the Supreme
Court. The latter tribunal rendered a de
cision upholding the order of the lower
court. It said that if the Indian woman
Is not Kite's wife she is not entitled to
the consideration prayed for, but if she Is
she should have the means of main
taining herself and pursuing her action.
The higher court declined to go Into the
merits of the relations between the
parties in interest, and the ruling was
made upon the ground that In making
the original order for alimony and fees
the lower court must have had some evi
dence that the Indian woman has a right
to sue as the wife of Hite.

vember.
The din of horn and -hoot of whistles
which speed the departure of : ISPS and
herald the incoming of a- new year do not
drown the lament of many- disappointed
politicians and job chasers who expected
to be rewarded for services more* or less
valuable to successful candidates at the
last municipal election. Hundreds there
were who sought and expected lucrative
positions under the new city administra
tion, but the hopes of only a few are
sure of realization and the disappointed
thousands are 10u... In their complaints
that they have been deceived by 'those
who control the .patronage about to be
distributed.
Immediately after the result of the elec
tion was known the party bosses an
nounced that the winning candidates
would give positions to those who earned
reward by fealty and faithful service to
the party, but since the pulls have been
brought into play and Democrats are to
be given fat jobs* in Republican offices,
and, consequently, there is much bitter
ness in the hearts of those stalwart. party
men who have been turned down by the
dictators of appointments.
For the past week the bosses have been
holding daily conferences on the subject
'' of appointments to positions In the City
j Hall, and the fate of the multitude of ap
i plicants will not be definitely known until
j to-night, when the list will be completed.
There is some danger, however, that the
! selections of the bosses will not go
! through Members of the new Board of
j Supervisors have a few. friends and rela
! tives they wish to place in fat positions,
' and as a result of this desire considerable
! friction between the bosses and the Su
i pervisors has â¢ been generated. * Nearly
I every member of the new board has some
impecunious relative or deserving friend
who needs maintenance. The Supervisar
. elect thinks the best manner to provide
; for these cases is â¢to secure a"; position
i under the city government. But .the
j bosses say they are the best â  judges' of
j the qualifications* of office-holders and. de
mand that, their, selections be -indorsed:
i Consequently the ratification of many ap
; pointments is still a 'matter, of specula

GALLANT RAINS CHEATED OUT
'â¢ OF A VICTORY.
Recount Shows the Contesting* Can

Elected by a Good- Majority-
Oyer His Opponent.
. â¢ Special Dispatch to' The Call. .
SANTA ROSA, De.c. 31.â .Sensational
developments* marked to-day's proceed
ings in the election contest of Gallant
Rains, -Democrat, against. David Walls,
the Republican nominee, for the seat on
the "Board* of Supervisors, which re
cently "was decided by the official can
vass to belong to Walls by a majority
of seventeen votes. In one precinct the
recount showed that twenty-five votes
cast for Rains were counted for Walls,
thus, giving him an advantage of fifty
over his opponent, and these returns
were after-Ward made out and certified
to by the election officers as being cor
rect. The news has created a big sen
sation.
The contest of Mr. Rains for the po
sition was filed a few days after the
official canvass of the votes by the
Board of Supervisors was completed,
but the matter did not come up for trial
until Thursday of this week. While
several mistakes were found from time
to time and while the usual number of
illegal and defaced ballots were discov
ered, it was not until to-day that the
trial was marked by any particularly
startling ' features.
It all happened while the attorneys
were engaged in counting ballots in
Wilson precinct, a suburb Of Petaluma,
and which. by the way. is Mr. Rains'
own voting place. The returns as can
. vassed by the Board of Supervisors
just after the election showed that.
Walls had carried the precinct by the
handsome ' majority of thirty-seven
votes. The recount to-day however,
showed that instead of the precinct
having -.given Walls a majority of
' thirty-seven votes it had given Rains,
the contestant, a majority of thirteen,
w:ith eighteen 'votes, .divided about
' equally, in- the hands of the court forb
advisenient. â  .

Wilson precinct on election night were:

The campaign made by both parties
for Gains and- Walls was very- bitter,
the former's enemies being particularly
active in* their efforts to defeat him.
Walls .himself is one of the best known
men In the county and Democrats as
well as Republicans, admit that if any
crooked work was .'done in his behalf
it was entirely without his knowledge.
' The change of fifty votes in this one
precinct gives the contested seat to
Rains' without doubt. Walls'., original
majority was only seventeen, .and the
vote as now recounted stands forty
seven in Rains' favor. The votes from
four precincts are' yet to be" recounted,
but these are all in Rains' favor with
â  one exception, and 'give him a majority
: over his opponent of fifty-one, which,
with those he had. -those he has just
gained-, and those in the. hands of the
. court, will -probably put him in by
about seventy-five votes. :
It is generally believed that the
Grand Jury will Investigate the case at

ON THE WARPATH
General Miles Must Answer Whether or Not

0 ' .NEW YORK, Dec. 31.â The Washington correspondent of the Her- 0
0 aid telegraphs: Secretary Alger has been asked by Commissary Gen- 0
0 eral Eagan to call upon Major General Miles for a categorical answer 0
0 to the question whether or not he made the staements attributed to 0
0 him by a New York newspaper concerning the beef furnished to 0
0 the army. Should the commanding general in reply deny the au- 0
0 thenticity of ' the interview, Commissary General Eagan purposes to 0.
0 take action against the newspaper. His friends, speaking for him, 0
0 declare that the statements are libelous, and that should General 0
0 Miles retract them, the newspaper will be called Upon to defend it- 0
0 self for the publication of allegations involving the beef industry of 0
0 the country and the entire commissary department. ' 0
0 It is General Eagan's expectation that he will receive notice from 0
0 the War Commission the coming week that he will be heard in an- 0
0 swer to charges made against his department by Major General 0
0 Miles. General Eagan is anxious to know why General Miles has 0,
.0 only just begun to investigate .the beef furnished to his army. It 0
0 was intimated to me by a high official that the reports obtained by 0
0 General Miles were, in reply to a circular letter which he addressed 0
0 to regimental officers. 0
0 '"Suppose you were the commanding officer of the regiment," said 0
0 the official, "and you were to receive a letter from your superior 0.
0 asking you what you thought of your equipment. Though you had 0
0 not filed any complaint before, chances are that you would have got 0
0 many to make in response to Inquiry. During the investigation he '0
0 has- been directed to make Major Garlington of the inspector gener- 0
0 al's department will find men who did nut like the beef; some who 0
0 grew tired of it, while others liked it. But the commissary cannot 0
0 be expected to furnish men on the fighting line with a great variety 0.
0 of foods. ' 0
0 "The beef supplied to General Miles' army was as wholesome as 0
0 any eaten in the United States. There may have been a few cans 0
0 which were not properly soldered, and spoiled in consequence, but 0
0 in tons of such meats it can hardly be expected that there would not .O.
0 be a certain percentage of loss." 0.
0 General Miles is busily collecting reports from officers and men 0
0 substantiating the statements he made to the War Commission. The 0
0 general is satisfied from the evidence in his possession that he has 0
0 proceeded properly, and he has received many letters congratulating 0
0 him on the course he is taking. 0

CHIMING BELLS RING
IN THE NEW YEAR
At Midnight Ten Thousand People
Assembled Around Old Trinity
in New York.
' NEW "YORK, Jan. 1.â Although a great
storm of snow was raging .there were 10,
--000 people around old Trinity at midnight
to hear the chimes ring in the new year.
The 300 policemen had little to do in the
way of quelling disturbances, for it was
too' cold and blustery for anything of that
kind beyond the blowing of horns. Tho
chimes' of Trinity rang out a number of
airs, chiefly patriotic. "Yankee Doodle"
being one of those longest, drawn out.
LONDON. Jan. I.â The dreary, rainy

many under the shadow of London's ca
thedral.
In anticipation of the event the authori
ties had caused to be put up an iron rail
ing around the semi-circular pavement In
front of the steps, but the precaution was
unnecessary, for the gathering, though
numbering perhaps 2000 people, was the
smallest and most orderly in many years.
The majority of those who had assem
bled were evidently Scotchmen, as was
evidenced by the constant whistling
of the "Cock o' the North." When the
stroke of midnight boomed out* there was
a volley of cheers and then "Auld Lang
Syne" was sung, the crowd slowly disap
pearing as the gong died out.

2015 on or near th.- coasts of British pos
sessions abroad, 1618 from British vessels
on or near the coasts of foreign countries
and 1027 on the high seas. Of the 2793
lives saved on the coasts of the United

apparatus and assistance from the shore,
614 were saved by lifeboats, 193 were saved
by coastguard beats and other craft, CB9

AFFAIRS IN CHILE.
A Narrow Escape From Political and
Financial Disaster.
AM's well that ends well, yet there is
no getting away from the fact that
Chili has had. a harrow escape from po
litical and financial disaster. Writing
from Santiago on the morrow of the
arbitration agreement, signed on Sep
tember 22, one of our correspondents
says: "Now that the longstanding dis
pute with Argentina is in a fair way
toward settlement, we shall be able
to set about economizing on the enor
mous expenditure for armaments, and
an incubus -will be lifted which has
been all but sinking the .country. Our
warlike preparations seem -to hay a been
considered in Europe reprehensible,
not to say suicidal," and Chili has been
recommended to sit with her hands'
folded and sell some of her expensive
ironclads; in response to this benevo
lent advice. I would quote the Chilian
proverb to the effect that 'a madman
knows more of his own affairs, than a
sane man does of other people's.' Our
only way to .prevent war and to oblige
Argentina to accept arbitration was to
arm to the teeth and bluff for all we
were worth."
Since the foregoing candid ' opinion
was penned the troublesome outstand
ing Pun de Atacama question has been
practically shelved, the Chilian Senate
having by an overwhelming majority
approved its reference to a joint Com
mission, with appeal to the . United
States Minister i- Buenos Ayres, as ex
clusively announced a fortnight ago in
these columns. The Puna issue, by the
way, is rather of a political than of " a
purely geographical character, depend
ent on the Interpretation of different'
treaties, and uncomplicated by "water
divide" considerations, for the suffi
cient reason that water is conspicuous
by its absence in the region. The lat
est item of intelligence from South \
America, coupled with the continuous
fall in the Buenos Ayres gold premium,
is undoubtedly the most important yet
to hand, affording as it does practical
proof of the subsidence of the antaeon
ism between Chili and Argentina. The
decree ordering the mobilization of the-
Chilian National Guard has been with
drawn, and it is to be hoped that the
good example wi*" 1 promptly be followed
on the other side of the Andes thus en
abling both republics to enter on the
path of retrenchment urgently required
by their finances. The Cabinet crisis
and ministerial resignations recently
cabled 1 from Valparaiso would appear
to have existed only In the imaidnation
of certain correspondents: at all events
the portfolio of foreign affairs remains !
in the hands of Admiral Latorre (twice'
reported to have resigned), to whose
admirable handling of the boundary
negotiations the present improved sit
uation Is to a great extent due.
As with Chili's external relation's so
with. her finances; the black cloud
having lifted from. the former, an im
mediate improvement may be expected
in the latter, the strain on which would,
if . continued, have reached the break
ing point. All denends on the curtail
ment of "extraordinary" expenditure,
the country's revenue being fortunately
comparatively unaffected by the depre
elation of the currency and amnly suffi- |
cient to meet the normal requirements
of the state. The customs reeetnts.
forming three-fourths of the Chilian
revenue, amounted, in the firs'- eitrht
months of the current vea.r to $36 031 -
969.02. against I'M. -"M*!. no nt in the cor

â¢ A criminal case is. pending in the mili
tary courts which is probably without
precedent in the annals of criminal juris
prudence. A sergeant -and a corporal of
the Seventh Regiment stand accused of
having caused the death of a private col
dier by beating him. incidentally they
are charged with abuse of authority and
violation of the personal rights of the sol
dier.
Now the medical experts have decided
that the beating administered the dead
soldier, shortly before bis demise was not
the cause of his death, but, on the con
trary, interrupted the progress of. a cere
bral congestion brought on by an ex
cessive use of alcoholic! stimulants. The
experts held, in fact, that if the beating
had been continued the man might have
recovered. In spite of this finding the
court found the accused guilty of abuse
of authority and sentenced them to two
years' imprisonment each. -From this
sentence an appeal has been taken to the
Supreme Court, whose decision Is being
expected'with great interest.â The Two

NORTH CAROLINA MILLS.
Statistics as to the Industrial Growth
and Conditions of "the Old
North State.''
In IS9O North Carolina was ninth' in
the list of cotton-spinning States in
the South, but has now gone to second
place. South Carolina leading. Geor
gia, the third State on the list, is' over
300,000 spindles behind North Carolina.
Only four other statesâ Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, New Hampshire and
Connecticutâ ahead of North Caro
lina in number of spindles.
There are 220 cotton mills, of which
29 make hoisery and 191 spin or. weave
or do both. There are in operation
1,054,656 spindles and 24,535 looms. No
less than 47 per cent of the mills run
day and night. The consumption of
cotton is now 163,359;000 pounds â¢ yearly.
The Increase of spindles in mills com
pleted this year is 43,000, and old mills
have enlarged their plants by adding
16,820 spindles. The only reduction is
due to two fires, which destroyed 3320
spindles, leaving the year's net gain
56,500 spindles.
The wages of cotton mill operatives
in this State is much lower than in the
New England States, and while the lat
ter have enacted laws regulating the
hours of the labor, all attempts to do
so in North Carolina have failed. The
average number of hours making a
day's work in the mills in this State is
eleven and three-quarters. On an av
erage the mills run 293 days out of 313
working days in the year.
There appears to be an abundance of
mill labor in the State. The employes
are better satisfied than any other
class, and there is practically no an
tagonism between employer and em
ployed, neither favoring labor regula
tion legislation. There are no strikes.
In fact, there has never been a mill
strike in the State.
The average daily wages paid to
skilled men is $1 07; unskilled, 68 cents;
to skilled women, 63 cents; unskilled,
45 cents; children, 32 cents. The gen
eral average is 63 cents for all, which
is said to be a gain of 1 cent over last
year. It costs as little to live in North
Carolina as in any State in the Union.
About 22 per cent of the mills have in
creased wages; over 28 per cent furnish
their employes houses free of rent.
There were during the year only thirty
two accidents, of which but one was
fatal. Of adult employes, 89 per cent,
and of children, 69 per cent, read and
write. At almost every mill there is
a free school. Mill owners support
most of these. â Baltimore Sun.
A Surprise for Brown.
"Brown has received a setback that
he will not recover from for some time,"
said Dodson, as he sipped his coffee.
"I honestly believe that he has cor
rupted every decent waiter in the city
by his outlandish system of overtipping,
making it almost impossible for a mod
est tipper to get any service at all.
"He had a habit of starting with the
head waiter and tipping them all down
the line. I don't know whether he ever
tipped the dishwasher or not, but I
have my suspicions that he did.
"The result has been that the waiters
looked upon him as a sort of Indian
nabob or a returned king from the
Klondike, and would pay no attention
to any one else when he was present.
"You might complain and storm all
you liked, but it would have no effect.
When .Brown entered, everything else
was dropped until the imaginary specks
of dirt were wiped from the immaculate
tablecloth and spotless china, and
Brown seated in all his solitary glory
at his favorite place, which was always

INCREASE IN CASH BALANCS

IN REVENUES.
Because of the Disturbance to Busi
ness Interests This Tax Will
Not Be Repealed in the
Near Future
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 31.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Notwith
standing the extraordinary expendi
tures on account of the war the treas
ury is in very good condition and closes
the year with more cash on hand than
when it opened, the cash balance to
night being $290,000,000, against $235.
--474,769 on December 31, 1897. This in
crease is due to the receipts from, the
Pacific railways, the proceeds of the
war loan bonds and the war revenue
taxes.
The receipts from the sale of war
loan bonds, amounting to $200,000,000,
foot up $199,095,119, a balance of nearly
$1,000,000 being deferred payments that
will soon be made. The war revenue
law has yielded about $60,000,000, mak
ing the total war fund the Government
has been able to draw upon about
$260,000,000. Against this the war ex
penses, as nearly as they can be esti
mated, amount to date to about $190,
--000,000. Nearly $156,000,000 of this was
on account of the army.
The ordinary receipts of the Govern
ment have fallen considerably below
the ordinary expenditures. This is due
in part to the disturbance of business
interests by the war. yy--i:.
Since the close of hostilities there has
been marked improvement, but there
is no ground for believing the war tax
can soon be repealed.
For the first six months of the fiscal
year fc the receipts from all sources foot
up $245,961,890, and expenditures more
than $329.000, thus making the de
ficit for the year to date more than
$84,000,000. This same proportion will
not be continued through the second
half of the year, for the war expendi
tures are gradually decreasing with the,
mustering out of troops and ordinary
receipts show a tendency to still fur
ther increase.
December is not usually the best
month in the year for customs receipts?
but it shows this year $16,764,324â
largest month's receipts since the Dins
ley law was enacted, and $5,103,536 in
excess of December of last year. The
internal revenue receipts for December
were $22,627,319, of which more than
one-third can be credited to war taxes.

The Committee <m Janitors reported
that It had investigated the charges of
inefficiency of the janitorial service, pre
ferred by Superintendent Webster, and
found his statements. to be absolutely un
true: -.hat the service was excellent" and
that the action of Superintendent Webster
was simply an attack on "poor hardwork
ing en and women." Mr. Webster's crit
icism was said "to be such as could ema
nate only from the lowest grade of a
moral coward." In conclusion the report
recommended that the janitor service be
placed under civil service. It was placed
on file.
Director Ragan spike in favor of the
civil service plan, ar.d at the conclusion
of his remarks the board took a recess
until. s o'clock.
It was nearly 6 o'clock before the gang
got together again. Armer. Head and
Derham remained away and Barrington,
who came in late, refused to take part in
the proceedings. The session lasted little
over half an hour, and that was amply
sufficient to put a fitting climax to the
many disgraceful proceedings that have
characterized the meetings of the board
from the time it h;fs existed.
Director Waller was bubbling over with
an exuberance of spirits and his volubility
would have put to shame the champion
spieler of the "greatest show on earth."
The other directors, while less r.oisv,
were equally reckless and the scene re
sembled nothing so much a? Ac assembly
of convivial-spirits in the back room of a
tavern.
Director, Ragan the .bail with a
"protest." as- he called it, against Judge
Belcher's criticism of the board.
"A certain weekly .sheet," "said Dr. Ra
gan, "refers in its issue to-day to the re
mark attributed to "- Judge Belcher in
which he sard the nine School Directors
constituting the majority of this board
should he put in a, cage and sunk to tha
bottom of the-bay, and adds that it might
be well to Include the Judge. I wish to
say that I rise to protest against the lan
guage of the man. who is sworn to ad
minister justice whert he shows his ani
mus 'to a' public body like this by vili
fying, its-. members, '-who at just as intel
ligent and as honest as himself. *He
should have his head. smothered in a com
pos: heap and stifled until, as time passed
on, the elements of his head mi'ng*led with
the elements* that make up that heap.*'-.
The indignant School Director said '
much more, but his language was such i
as is* not heard in polite society or' in |
newspapers. He was intensely in earnest
and Insisted that his words, be , taken
down, stopping and repeating his remarks
frequently. in order that there might he
no mistake as to his meaning. â  He wound
up by declaring he had been informed
that the persistent attacks on the School
Board had been instigated and the funds
for necessary expenses attached thereto,
furnished by the' society of the Junior' O
rder of American. Mechanics.-
Director Gallagher . expressed regret
that his report as chairman oi the Fi
nance. Committee' was still in the hands of
the printer.. He had -hoped, to be. able to
present it it. the meeting and expressed
the opinion that it Would be interesting
reading because It contained recom
mendations, in line "with the "remarks of
Dr. Ragan. 'He proceeded to mention a
few of the choicest morsels' in the report

<*> I had been proposed to the Regents of the University of California *5>
4. I for the presidency of that institution came to me as a com- +

*â¦" date. â 
â¦ "I have never given such a matter a thought and my ambitions do not <*
4. run in that direction. For the past twenty-five years I have devoted my best -f
A efforts to my chosen calling and have found encouragement and satisfaction
in it. I desire to pursue my chosen life's work to the end. Thirteen years
"** of this time has been spent in San Francisco and during that period I have
â¦ formed ties that it would be extremely painful to break. Therefore, I do not <Â§â 
4- feel that I should be considered in the matter whatever. +
1 "The office of president of the. University of California is a highly re- <j>
sponsible one. It requires for its successful conduct 'a man who is. many- _,
â¦ sided; one who can be calm and dignified; one who is well matured in years
v but is young in heart: one who, while being a student, is also a financier, a *$'
+ diplomat, a man of wide mental graspâ ln fact an official who is everything -â¦â 
to â¢ the institution, the welfare of which he is supposed to promote. <Â§>
? â¢"I do not feel fitted for such a task and am satisfied that my ambitions _.
~t run along the lines of life lam now pursuing. Whatever abilities I may <r
possess belong to my people. I have worked hard for them and they have Â£
â *" done much for me. I do not think they would expect or desire me to aban- *"*
<$â¢ don this work? even to go into wider and more active fields. The question -t
-4. as to what I would do in the event that the honorable position came to me <*
. unsolicited is one that I do not desire to discuss for the reason that such a 4.
**** supposition is nonsensical. ..
*â¦" ."There are able men in this State who are thoroughly equipped for that â¢
<S> position and who, if properly approached, would accept it and give to the *â¦-
4- State the best that is in them, and for this reason I think it is well to not <?>
y confuse the situation by having too many local names before the Regents
for consideration. By following th - theory antagonisms may be avoided. I
"*" have been approached by enthusiastic friends to-day who thought highly of "**
*) the preposition, but I figuratively poured cold water down their necks by â â¦â¢
4 asking them if their vanity was not biasing their judgment. â¢ <*>
a "No, I wish it understood' that my desire is to follow to the close of my 4.

"*" objects before me to be accomplished and I would prefer to be not diverted
* from my task. Let the honor and the obligations go to some fully com- "â¦"
-+- petent man who is seeking the place." 4>
The fact, exclusively stated In The Call yesterday, that Dr. Voorsanger 4.
had been proposed for the office of president of the Berkeley University ere- -
i ated a great deal of interest; and the Rabbi would certainly have had rea-
T son to be flattered could he have heard the comments upon the proposl- *T
'* tion. In fact, his friends are quite entnused over the matter, and it is prob- "
â¦ able that they .will ably advocate him for the place unless there is some un- "â¦"
â¢v expected change in the circumstances. <Â«>
'X The situation at the present time is. that while Dr. Voorsanger declines 4.
the nomination, his close friends say that if circumstances so developed
- that the regents selected him his high regard for duty would cause him to :
+ accept the responsibility, notwithstanding his longings might be in other di- **"
<S> ions. Furthermore, that if he did accept the exalted position he would â¢
4 go at the task with an his energies with the idea of making it his life â¦
* work. rf>
: Thus far the regents have not conferred upon the selection of a successor .
*â¦" to President Kellogg, but they are individually worrying a great deal about
â¦ this grave duty which must be performed between. now and March next. It "^
is understood that the regents' committee has for consideration the names -â¦-
of several well-known men who are not candidates and who do not know that Â«>
? they may be selected for the place. The regents will deliberate on the quail-
"*" (.cations of the men under consideration and if they decide that a certain

Phelan Made Numerous Futile Nomi
nations^He Vetoes Hall of Jus
tice Contracts â No Gas
Inspector Elected.
A resolution came before the Board
of Supervisors two weeks ago impos
ing a license of 5 cents the square
foot on all fence signs exceeding
in height twelve feet. It came up for
final passage at last Monday's meeting,
and was referred back to committee in
order that the fence artists might have
another chance to press their suit. As a
result the committee report came in at
yesterday's meeting recommending that
the fence limit be increased to twenty
two feet. Supervisor Britt, chairman of
the committee, worked the report
through. When the committee recom
mendation came before the board yes
terday it was lost through the need of
three votes, ; and the motion was on the
original resolution of twelve feet.
It carried with eight votes, despite that
Crusoe Phelan's Friday Dodge made one
of his well known speeches against the
order. He was seconded by Britt, who
thought that a thirty-foot side of paint
ot nondescript colors was not a scar on
municipal beauty and the fences would
be nice for the children to look at.
Mayor Phelan also attempted further
nominations for the office of Gas to
spector, ut the incumbent, Charles L.
Taylor, is highly satisfactory to the
board, and all of the Mayor's nomin
ations were referred to the next board.
After naming three Mr. Phelan re
fused to make any further nom
inations until the board told why It
did not elect. The board refused and the
Mayor kept to his, threat, and other busi
ness was brought' up.
Tax Collector Block's failure to make a
report of his tax collections to Auditor
Broderick induced the board to pass a
resolution Instructing him to report in
detail at . once the names of property
owners paying delinquent taxes for the
years 1568-69 to 11374-75, including 1881-82,
ISB7-8S to IS9S-96
Boxing permits were granted to the Ex
celsior Club for a contest between January
20 and 30; Palace Athletic Club be
tween February 1 and 15; Princeton Ath
letic Club for same evening in January.
The resolution granting permission to
modify the plan 3of the Hall of Justice
was adopted.
The two bids opened at last Monday's
meeting for the construction of a police
station on Seventeenth street were re
jected. Both proposals exceeded the
limit of $50,000 fixed as the cost of the
new building. New plans were ordered
drawn. - * .*:
The Spring Valley Water Company was
requested to place fire hydrants at the
corners of Seventh and Market streets
and Ninth and Market streets.
The Mayor returned without Iris ap
proval the resolution awarding th.;- con
tract tor furnishing the Hall of Justice
and Morgue for i" '<". He objects that
the price charged was excessive and that
bidders were not put ln possession of
facts sufficient to enable them to make a
proper bid. â  :-^
The board will meet on Tuesday next,
when it will turn over its duties and lega
cies to the incoming Supervisors.
Alas for Greek Bachelors.
According to a note in the Counter de
Paris, the Athenians and Greeks collec
tively intend to exclude all bachelors
from their Parliament. The idea seems to
be that the bachelor has no stake in the
commonwealth; if he is represented, that
is as much as he can ask for; a repre
sentative he ought never to be. for whom
does he represent except himself? And
herein the Greeks seem to fancy that
they have found a cure for celibacy, so
that all citizens will marry, and the law
ful and legitimate population of Athens
will increase, while every young Greek
having before him as the summum bonum
a seat in the Chamber well know that his
best assurance thereof will be the votes
of his constituents, based on the size of
his family. Should- the measure be passed
âand there are so many canards of anti
bachelor crusades that one feels some
doubt about the storyâ Europe will watch
the experiment of the Parliament of the
married men, with much interest. It will
not last long, because when women are
elected to "Parliament they will restore
the bachelor legislator, as the sittings
would-be too dull for them without him
â¢But it is a retrograde measure In any
case. A Vienna savant has lately an
nounced that "love itself Is probably a
microbe." The microbe, we know, a!
always slays the unfittest; therefore, the
married men are the unfittest; therefore,
the bachelor is the fittest for a seat ie
Parliament.â Pall Mall Gazette.
Luxury and Extravagance. !
In general the destruction of wealth is a
social as well' as an individual loss. The â .
wealth that is used upon riotous living
ils diverted from better uses. Extrav
agance is not necessarily luxury. The
mere transfer of wealth from one "hand to
j another does not involve destruction.
[ Consumption means using up. When a
| nation spends $250. for a great picture
the wealth is not destroyed: it is simply
transferred. When the "Jubilee Plunger"
ran through $2,500,000 in twelve calendar
months the wealth of the world was
diminished only by the amount of it he
and those who sponged on him put down
their throats and otherwise wantonly de
stroyed. In so far as it was simply trans
ferred to others to whom he paid extrav
agant prices it was not destroyed.
To give high prices for articles which
are rare is not necessarily luxury, for the
\ price and the rare edition of the old mas
> ter both remain. It is true that extrava
; gance may mean the transfer of wealth
j to those who will not use it well, but it
does not usually mean this. It generally
â  involves a transfer to the hands of those
who will use it more wisely.âlnterna

A chill is as a rule the first symptom.
This is followed by pains in the limbs
and a cough. Then if the Grip is not
checked Pneumonia follows. Those who
overwork themselves and live irregu-
lar lives are the ones most liable to fall
victims. 'ji '.**â¢"*/-.
My advice to those who get their feet
wet and are forced to remain out of
doors is to keep continually moving and
take "77." A Cold can be avoided in
this manner.
"77" not alone "breaks up" the Cold,
but it fortifies against taking Cold.

troubled with terrible sick headaches and spells of vomiting ever since
she was a little tot Her father thought she would outgrow them, but
she didn't. She did not chew her food enough, and what she threw
up seemed but half digested. Through the advice of a friend, 1
began giving her

She was benefited at once, and after a treatment of one week the
trouble ceased, and she has not had a bad spell since."
Since writing this letter, the lady states that she has reduced the
dose to half a Tabule a day and the good effect still continues, and she

BUCKWA MOWS
DOWN ANOTHER
WORLD'S RECORD
Two and One-Quarter
Miles in 3:51. -.".;
A GRAND PERFORMANCE
CAPTURES THE ATHENIAN CLUB
STAKES.
Hidden to Victory by "Skeets" Mar-
Favorites in Bad Form at Oak-
Bernardillo Equaled a ;
California Mark.
The lons standing record for two and a
quarter miles of :i:st"'",. made by those
doughty turf heroes of long ago. Preak
ness and Springbok, when they ran their
memorable dead heat at "Saratoga on July
12, 1575, was badly fractured .it Oakland
yesterday. It remained for Ed Purser's
honest old gelding, Buckwa, to accom
plish the feat. The big son of Buckra
showed a clean set of els to Daisy F,
Veto*, and Wheel of Fortune in the
Athenian Club selling stakes, and set the
mark at 3:51. Old-timers said it was the
â¢ best performance they ever witnessed,
arid prophesy that the record will become
moldy ana covered with cobwebs ere it
is again lowered.
And Purser's horse was not the favored
one in the betting. The smart ones said
Daisy F would do the trick, and the big
Saturday crowd took the "hunch," send
ing the Riley filly to the post favorite In
the betting. Opening up on even terms,
tlie odds against Buckwa drifted back
until 2 to 1 was obtainable. "Skeets"'
"Martin's instructions were evidently to go
out in the lead with "Buck" and race his
held to a standstill. He did it. and in a
commanding fashion. At no stage of the
Journey was he pressed, and passed the
wire almost an easy winner, four lengths
ahead of the favorite. Veloz, which ran
an astonishingly good race and also bet
tered the oIU record, was third, fifteen
lengths in advance of weary Wheel of
tune.
When the time was announced the win
ner and his rider were tendered an ova
tion. The fractional time was as follows;
tine mile. 1:41%; one and a half miles,
_:o2V. one and three-quarter miles, _:SS-**',;
two miles. 3:20; two and a quarter miles,
3:51.
It was a great day's racing throughout.
In the third event th. hooded Bernardillo
Â«-.|tia!ed it.. California record of 1:46-S4 for
one mile and a sixteenth, and in the spin
over the Futurity course Mary Black
gave the sprinters a mark of LOO I ', to
shoot at. The favorites fared badly;
Jinks and Shasta Water turning up as
the only winning ones. However, most of
the horses that did lead their fields out
â wore backed, and tin- bookmakers laid
away little coin.
Shasta Water, a :; to 5 chance, with
'J rpe up. easily annexed the lirst event
decided, at. seven furlongs. Taking the
.id In the stretch, she passed the judges
Three lengths before Kamsin.
The ring took no liberties with Pat
Dunne's fast filly. Jinks, holding her a
1 to 3 favorite for the six furlong run
that follow.-. Away third, she soon
showed in front, but at the end. owing to
the flash of gayety displayed by lie*
Nichols, only beat Dr. Sheppard a short
head. Rainier, grotesquely piloted by
D. McCarthy, was third.
It was not Cromwell's day, even though
the chestnut horse did make a determined
bid tor the mile and a sixteenth selling
affair. Ruling an even money favorite he
was downed handily at the finish by iW
pardillo, ridden by Charley Thorpe. The
winner was at one stag.- of the betting
quoted at 5 to i. The three-year-old
Hardly finished a clove third.
An exceedingly fast cluster of sprinters
â¢was gathered in the sprint over
the Futurity course, fifth on the menu.

COURSING THAT
PLEASED MANY
SPORT LOVERS
A Good Betting Crowd
at Ingleside.
SAPLINGS THAT CAN'T BE BEAT
PRINCE GEORGE AND SHYLOCK
BOY GOOD PERFORMERS.
â¢' ~ ~~ â¢
The Great All-Age Seventy-Two Dog
Stake Will Attract an Im
mense Crowd to the
; Park To-Day.
Considering that a Dawson City zephyr
swept' across the Ingleside Park Coursing
demesne yesterday, causing many a good
patron of the game of turn and kill to
visit Dr. D. Shannon's headquarters at
regular Intervals, the attendance at the
Inaugural day's meeting of the three
stake events" was tolerably fair.
Th.- coursing was unusually good as the
hares, during cold snaps invariably run
with a dash and vim â  that stirs up the
blood in the veins of the natural-born
leash'men. '.
. Yesterday ' was devoted to the run
down and the first round of the
sapling ami puppy stakes, and as
there will be coursing to-day and to-mor
row the director generals of the park
have decided to. hold only a round of
each stake,, which will., consist of the
puppy, sapling . and all-age. In. other
words there will be held forty-three runs
to-day and forty-two to-morrow. The
total number of courses during the three
days' meeting is 126. As there are seven
ty-two dogs entered for the all-age stake,
It is but reasonable. to suppose that the
sport of. to-day will be of very high class
order. â¢".â¢.. â¢
J. .-ashmen will remember that owing to
the length of the programme the first
course will be called at 10:30 sharp this
morning, and according to a decision ar
rived at during a recent meeting of club
officers entries under the heading of ken
nels will be abolished In futon least
so far as the Ingleside Park Is concerned.
Intelligent leaahmen understand that un
limited fraud and deception* can be prac
ticed by alleged sportsmen who enter
theirs or some other person's dogs under
the name of so-and-so's kennels. To pre
vent trickery in this direction dogs must
be entered In future under the names of
their respective owners.
The sport to-day should certainly be of
a very high quality, as tin- dogs entered
for the all-age stake are crackajacks.
The result of yesterday's coursing Is
as follows:
Sapling stakeâ Result of run-down: Rock

SEATTLE HAS A
WHITE CHALK
MARK IT LAST
Won the First Game
From Santa Cruz.
PLAYED GOOD BASEBALL
THE VISITORS ARE JUBILANT
AND HAPPY.
Fine Fielding by Both Teams and
Steady Pitching Keep a Small
Crowd Cold for an
Hour.
"Tacks" Parrott filled himself with air
and Eighth and Harrison dust yester
day ' afternoon and became mentally
aberrated. That Is why Seattle won the
game from Santa Cruz, which perform
ance is the first erasure on the blotted
escutcheon of the northerners since their
arrival in the city. They scored four
runs, and as their opponents sent but
three men across the rubber they won the
game. 7 . -J
"Tacks" set the pace for the exercise
of critical eyes. At one time he wanted
the game stopped because Fitzgerald's
hand was off the base, although the ball
was on it, but in this he did not receive
the support or fortifying nod of "Stoutty"
Doyle, and the game went on. It was
this show of energy, coupled with an
excess of mental and pedal motion that
set an example for the Seattle team and
left the Cruziana panting In cold baseball
frenzy.
Seattle came all the way from the
North to teach the surf-bathers how a
game can be won on three hits against
six of the other fellows. In the first in
ning Santa Cruz sent Donlin and Dcvi -
reaux home and "Manager Doyle- forgot for
the moment to stamp his feet and smash
his hands together. But his Christ
misery was punctured when his own boys
came to the bat and Kleibe and Clarke
evened up the score.
There was nothing doing in the next
inning except by the spectators, who
shouted, stamped and looked wise to keep
warm. In the fourth Kleibe scored an
other run, which was ballanced in the
eighth by a run for Santa Cruz. Seattle
then X-rayed Whalen's curves and Hop
kins was credited with the winning run.
The game was the best seen from the
visitors, tbe fielding good and the work
of both pitchers up to the handle. The
score Is as follows:

SUPREME COURT CHANGES.
Deputy R. A. Marshall Appointed as
Secretary to the Justices.
When the doors of the Supreme Court
open for business on Tuesday many old
faces will be seen among the deputies and
other subordinates, although the head of
the clerical department will be changed.
T. H. "Ward will turn the office over to
<;. W. Root, the successful Republican
candidate for Clerk of the Supreme Court.
Mr. Ward steps down credited with the
kindliest of feelings on the part of the
Justices of the court. He will not leave
at once as Mr. Root wishes to have his
services for some time yet, aria" Mr. Ward
has been appointed temporarily as a dep
uty. Another of the old force is A. W.
Johnson, who made a strong fight in the
last campaign for Root. He is billed for
head deputyshlp. E. S. Butter worth, who
has been in the office for a long time, is
also to be retained. J. J. Duncan Is an
other deputy on the list. 'William M.
Ward Is also retained, with every pros
pect of being permanent. He will be in
the office at Los Angeles and his father,
T. H. Ward, will go to the Sacramento
office. Mr. Root has appointed his sister,
Miss Iff. A. Root, as one of his deputies,
but the appointment is understood to bo
only temporary.
Probably the best pleased employe in
the Clerks Office at the turn things have
taken is Deputy Clerk R. A. Marshall.
Everybody thought he was booked to
walk the political plank, but something
happened yesterday. Mr. Marshall was
called Into the court and informed by the
court that his services were too valuable
to have him the victim* of political fate,
He was appointed to the position of sec
retary to the court, with a fair salary

STATUE OF JAMES LICK.
California to Do Honor to Its Philan
thropic Pioneer. 7/
The Society of California Pioneers has
takefi the Initiative In a movement for the
erection In Golden Gate Pai'k of a- monu
meat to the memory of the late James
Lick. At a recent- meeting of the society
a resolution was passed in which it "was
recited that Lick in his lifetime had be
queathed to the city and State and to a
number -of semi-public organizations
sums of money aggregating $3,000,000 for
the benefit of the people. It was thought
that the least the people could' do in re
turn would he to erect a suitable statue
of the philanthropist, and that this should
be done by the Legislature. In order to
start the movement it was decided to ask
the co-operation of the regents of the
university and the Academy of Sciences,
which Lick created.
These bodies at once complied with the
request and a meeting was held at which
the following' representatives were an
nounced: :-yy[:

NEW CLUB OFFICERS ELECTED.
Improvements in Precita Valley Be
ing Pushed With Vigor.
At the regular weekly meeting of the
Precita Valley improvement Club last
Friday night the following officers were
elected: J. li. Vizzard, president; John T.
Graham, vice president; H. Young, sec
retary; William McCarthy, treasurer; and
William McCreany, sergeant at arms.
The executive committee of the club
was selected from among the most active
and energetic workers of the district.
They are as follows: John T. Graham, J.
B. Vizzard, David Goggin, Carl Peterson,
S. A. Byrne, J. E. O'Brien and John lav
den. To these men the club is indebted
for much of its success in getting from
the Supervisors the many Improvements
for the district. Among the latest is that
of getting an appropriation for the im
provement of Bernal Park, which site
stands in the center of the space between
Precita avenue, north and south.
The contractor who has had the lob to
grade and build the sewer on Bryant
street came in for a scoring at the meet
ing, as he has failed and has kept others
from bidding on th.- work, which is con
sidered as one of the greatest means for
bettering the sanitary condition of the
section. As a relief, however, the con
tract will 1..- taken from him and relet at
the next meeting of the Board of Super
visors. *
MINE HOST'S LIABILITY.
A Cazadero Landlord Will Have to
Stand Heavy Damag-es.
Several years ago there was a bad acci
dent on the road between Cazadero and
Fort Ross, in which a party of pleasure
seekers were dumped Into the road and
more or less injured. An action for dam
ages was begun by Mrs. Emma A. Tomp
kins and the others to recover damages
from George S. Montgomery, who was the
proprietor of a hotel and livery stable in
Cazadero. Tho injured people were all
guests at the hotel, and the order for the
rig and driver, was given at the - hotel
office. The foundation for the complaint
in the action was that the driver was in
competent and the rig unsafe, hence the
proprietor was responsible for the acci
dent. The defense was that the rig was
th.- property of another, and that tho
driver, Joy, was no employe of the de
fendant.
In the lower court the plaintiffs ob
tained damages, and the case was appealed
to the Supreme Court. The Justices held
with the lower court that Montgomery
was liable for the damages sustained, as
It was In his hotel that the rig was or
dered, the guests giving directions as to
what they wanted and leaving the de
tails to the host. They agreed to Mont
gomery's terms of hire and other ex
penses; hence he was clearly liable.
A DELAYED INQUEST.
End of the Sonderup Case in Which
Dr. Kuhlman Figured.
The inquest into the death of Jens W.
Sonderup, believed to have been killed in
a street-car accident on April 23, 1896, was
resumed yesterday by Coroner Hawkins,
after a rest of nearly two years. The in
quest had been interrupted by the refusal
of one of the witnesses. Dr. Charles G.
Kuhlman, to answer certain questions put
by Dr. Hawkins In his capacity as Coro
ner. Kuhlman was committed for con
tempt and appealed to the Supreme Court,
which tribunal recently rendered an opin
ion that th.- Coroner had no right to com
mit for contempt. The jury yesterday
rendered a verdict tnat owing to lack of
evidence they were unable to say in what
manner the deceased came to his death.
BRIDLE ROAD IN THE PARK.
It Will Be Extended for a Mileâ New
Rhododendrons.
The Park Commissioners met yesterday
and decided to extend the popular bridle
path for a mile beyond its present limit.
W. S. Davis presented Golden Gate Park
with fifty new varieties of rhododendrons
âa gift that was highly appreciated, es
pecially by Park Superintendent McLaren,
who is always looking toward some im
provement for his beloved park.

A POPULAR MISTAKE
Regarding Remedies Tor Dyspep-
sia and Indigestion.
The national disease of Americana is
indigestion or in its chronic form, dys-
pepsia, and for the very reason that It
is so common many people neglect tak-
ing proper treatment for what they
consider trilling stomach trouble, when
| as a matter of fact, indigestion lays the
i foundation for, many incurable dis-
eases. No person with a vigorous,
I healthy stomach ill fall a victim to
consumption. Many kidney diseases
and heart troubles date their beginning
from poor digestion; thin, nervous peo-
ple are really so because their stom-
achs are out of gear; weary, languid,
faded out women owe their condition
to imperfect digestion.
When nearly every person you meet
is afflicted with weak digestion it is not
surprising that nearly every secret pat-
ent medicine on the market claims to
be a cure for dyspepsia, as well as a
score of other troubles, when in fact, as
Dr. Werthier says, there is but one
genuine dyspepsia cure which is per-
fectly sale and reliable, and moreover,
this remedy is not a patent medicine,
but it is a scientific combination of pure
pepsin (free from animal matter), vege-
table essences, fruit salts and bismuth.
It is sold by druggists under name of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. No extrav-
agant claims are made for them, but for
indigestion or any stomach trouble,
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are far
ahead of any remedy yet discovered.
They act on the food eaten, no dieting
is necessary, simply eat all the whole-
some food you want and these tablets
will digest it. A cure results, because
all the stomach needs is a rest, which
' Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets give by do-
ing the work of digestion.
Druggists sell these tablets at 50 cents
per package. Circulars and testi-
monials sent free by addressing F. A.

FARRELL NOT
INCONVENIENCED
BY CONVICTION
Battered a Boy and
Took His Dog.
A POLICE COURT FARCE
HIS SENTENCE POSTPONED TO
SUIT HIM.
c-
Young Kelly Pleads Guilty to An
other Crime and Will Spend
New Year's Day
in Jail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway, Dec. 31.
Pete Farrell. a deputy pound man who
cruelly beat a lad six weeks ago after
taking his dog from him, is luckyâ the
Police Court. He has created the idea
that he has a pull. Over a month ago
he was convicted in the Police Court of
the cowardly assault, and yet lie ha not
been sentenced. The record in his case
16 as follows: He was arrested Novem
ber 25, arraigned the following day and
convicted of battery November 2S. His
case was continued till the next morning
for sentence. When the next morning
came it was continued to December 2.
On December 2 Farrell didn't i'eel like
being sentenced, so he was granted a con
tinuance to December 12. On that date
he sent a message from somewhere that
he had missed his train and could not ap
pear to be sentenced, so his case went
over till the next morning, December 13.
On this date, for no reason given in the
record, Farrell was granted a continu
ance to December 30. On December 30
Farrell sent a doctor's certificate that he
was too sick to appear in court and be
sentenced. So his case was again set over
till January -4 of next year.
On January 4 a new Judge will be on
the bench who knows nothing of the
merits of the case and Farrell's chances
under the circumstances for another con
tinuance until the Judge shall have
learned some of ilia detans will be very
good.
The case was one that admitted of no
. defense. Farrell was taking a dog of a
little boy named Charles de Mousset. The
boy didn't want to see his dog stolen and
t-lie burly pound man battered him. The
evidence was so convincing that Farrell
Was speedily convicted. It is said that
Farrell has an Intimation that his sen
tence will be a tine of $50 and that lie is
tfcylng to catch enough dogs to enable
. him to pay it. This explanation, how
ever. Is not altogether acceptaDle to the
friends of the little boy whim he peat,
â¢And they are anxiously looking for the
"day when Farrell shall be fittingly pun
â  ished for his crime.
â¢ William Kelly, ,i young lad, charged
with embezzling from Fred Becker, is evi
dently unluckyâ in the Police Court. Kelly
pleaded guilty to one of the four charges
a.gaiiibt him to-day and the other charges
'Wfere then dismissed. Attorney Bradford
â :WfÃ3ter made a statement to the court
iir-beiiair of the boy, saying that he was
very; jwung and bad got into; evil asso
ciations. A sentence of ninety days in
p"r"l*on was then Imposed. The defend
ant's mother was In court and showed
that site felt very keenly the disgrace her
:'Â£'oa- I ad brought upon himself, but she
could .not restrain her motherly affection
Jor". m. As lie was being conducted be-
JeÂ«*. she went over and kissed him, say
ing* ."I'm so sorry." This <iuiet demon
stration on her part moved the entire
court room and all wished that the boy
could have been cleared of the charge
and freed. He does not appear to be a
boy of bad instincts, but lias evidently
eimply yielded to evil Influences.

MIDNIGHT, 1898-99.
PASS round the foaming wassail bowl! Recall the olden ways,
And pledge the Passing Year In wine, with pride of ancient days.
One foot upon the festive board, one hand uplift on high,
We speed the Old and meet the New with welcome and with sigh;
For we have lived to see the age of chivalry reborn,
Our victors smile with gentle brow, our vanquished fear no scorn.
The Old Year breathes a blessing on the Young Year yet unborn.
So here's to gallant "98,
Which poured out blood like wine.
And here's to sad or gladsome fate
That comes with '99!
Drink long, drink deep! Through fire and ruth
With heart and sinews sore;
We fought and conquered for the Truth,
A man can do no more.
Hush! Pass the bowl with whispered word, Its brim Is cypress crowned,
And wistful ghosts, with large-eyed glance, are hovering around;
They hall from that ancestral home, the dim Walhalla Hall,
Where our own kith and lineage pace, with steps that noiseless fall.
To us they band their legacy, their lives to honour vowed. '.
The lives which battle and disease enwrapped In honor's shroud.
The lives for which their countrymen thank God ln accents proud.
r So here's to gallant '9S.
Which poured out blood like wine.
And here's to sad or gladsome fate
Thai comes with '99!
Drlng long.* drink deep! Through fire and ruth,
With weary heart? and sore.
Our soldiers Buffered for the Truth,
We ask to do no more. -"-â '?â â¢-'"'â¢ â¢ ..'
Pass round the bowl in silent pledge, soft wailings fill the air.
Dee 1 ,) sobs from women's broken hearts, low kneeling in despair;
Tbey mourn their dead and weep their dying, dear fond hearts cleft in twain,
Yet ne'er a one would call those martyred "heroes back again.
Like men they wrought, like women prayed, when honour was assailed;
Like men they wrought , like women prayed, the while their kinsmen tolled;'
Like men they wrought, like women wept, when enemies we're foiled.
So pledge the dames, of 'f.*-;
Who poured out love like wine,.
And pray that" hearts, now desolate,
. Find peace In '99! â¢
They sped their through fire and ruth.
I.lke Spartan dames of yore,
Then suffered, fainting, for the Truth,
Their sex can do no more.
Pass round the bowl,. 'tis wreathed with bays, the Wan Year lifts his hes* 3
And points up, with a smile of peace, to trophies overhead,
To bayonets, machete points and flashing scimitar.
All" blazoned with some hero's bloodâ some friepd or: foe of war.
The wan Year wears a peaceful smile upon his peaceful face,
He.beckons, with a Hid hand, the English-speaking 'race.
Who clasp the trembling Earth about in Honor's close - embrace.
List! Slow the chimes of midnight fall
Adown the qulv'ring air;
Lift high the wassail bowl, and call
Aloud the words they bear:
Man's love pour fr.rth like wine."
"May I'eace with Honor be our fate,
Hush! Drop the pall o'er '08.
And here's to '99!

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
-'.. 908 Broadway, Dec. 31..
Brother Agnin of St. Mary's College,
which is conducted by the Christian
Brothers, says that the dispatches. being
sent all over the country relating to the
disciplining of some of .the brothers are
altogether wrong and misleading.
"It is time that a correct statement of
this matter was published," said Brother
Agnin this afternoon. "It has been stated
that there is a serious conflict between
the head of the house of .brothers at
Paris and the order in this country relat
ing to the curriculum in use in our col
leges. This Is false and ridiculous. Ever
since the Christian Brothers came to this
country they have taught the classics
and have gradually raised their standard
of education. We are not guided by any
one at Paris in so far as thedetails of our
work go. Our standing among educa
tional institutions in America is such
that It would be ridiculous for any one to
assume that we should not teach any
thing but elementary subjects. We could
not maintain our position for a week if
we did any such stupid thing.
"Not only do we teach the classics, but
it is compulsory on every student to in
clude the classics in his studies except he
be taking a purely commercial course. A
few months ago a few brothers from this
country were called to Paris for a confer
ence,'but it was not to punish them, or,
as the Eastern reports have said, 'discipline'
them, but merely to confer with the head
of our house. I am sure that no newspa
per man knows what transpired at the con
ference, for such matters are never
given out for obvious reasons. It has also
been stated that Brother Ambrose of
Oakland and another Californian brother
were ordered to Paris for punishment.
Poor Brother Ambrose was in ill health
and had been trying to arrange for a trip
to Europe for five years, and when It did
become possible he was a victim to the
wreck of the steamer La Bourgogne. No
other brother from California was even
called to the conference,- much less or
dered abroad for punishment. I hope these
facts will give us brothers a little peace."

Bed Cure for Lunatics.
A lengthy report has been published on
the general subject of lunacy in France,
the most noticeable feature of which Is
the advocacy by Dr. Magnan of a new
method for treating cases of mania and
melancholia. The method is simply keep
ing the patient in bed. This Is trouble
some at the outset, .especially in cases of
mania, but after the first two or three
days the patient accommodates himself
and becomes much, more tractable. He
then begins to improve steadily, and the
results that have been obtained by prac
tical experience, extending over a -great
number of cases, are very satisfactory.
Dr. Magnan entirely disapproves of the
strait waistcoat and insists on treating
the maniacs like patients suffering from
other kinds of illness. The general re
port shows that alcohol Is#responslble for
the greatest proportion ot lunacy.âLon

Oakland Office San Francisco Call, !
908 Broadway, Lee. 31.
This little petition, insignificant though I
it appears, contains a very clever little j
joker, not in Itself, but in the manner In
which It is prepared.
A few nights ago several members of
the Alameda legislative delegation joined j
with the Merchants' Exchange in discuss- \
ing various matters, among them the ;
1 question of the division of the county. j
! Senator Stratton stated that It would re-
I quire some very carefully drawn bills to
lay the foundation for dividing Alameda
j County. He also said that the merchants
should employ some attorney well posted i
j on constitutional law to draft such a bill.
The merchants made a little Inquiry and '
' found that the legal work could be done I
for the comfortable sum of $2000. They
did not quite see why with such an able I
legislative delegation the merchants
should be called upon to prepare bills for !
the Legislature.
A quiet little conference was held among
members of the Merchants' Exchange and
the Board of Trade yesterday morning,
and the matter was discussed in detail.
It was the prevailing Impression that If !
a representative number of tax-payers
signified their desire to divide this county
it would become the duty of the legisla
tors to carry out the wishes of the peo
pie who elected them.
I As a result of the conference the above
Eetltlon was drawn up to-day and is now
olng circulated all over the county for
signatures.
. It will be noticed that the petition is I
addressed "To the Senators and Repre
sentatives In the Legislature assembled,"
and should a reasonable number of names
be obtained It will necessarily become the
duty of the Alameda delegation In the
Legislature to carry out the wishes of ]
this county. This will relieve the mer- !
: chants and promoters of the division I
j scheme from any responsibility, and also i
[ from the expense of preparing such bills, â 
. and will place all the responsibility on the ;
I Senators and Assemblymen from this
county.
When this petition reaches the head- '
| quarters of the Alameda delegation there !
! will no doubt be an interesting discussion. I

SONGS j UNDER THE HAMMER.
Prices Paid Which Show What Are
Favorite Melodies in England.
There ;is money , as well as music in
songs, .. .7' Â» , 7'
A sixteen â  days" sale of songs Is now
in progress at the auction , rooms of
Messrs. Puttlck & Simpson of Leicester
Square, and no less a sum than Â£15,000
has been realized by the first five days
of the sale. " . *
That is a big sum "undoubtedly, but
Messrs. 'Puttiek & Simpson, who were
seen by a Daily Mail representative
yesterday, state that, as a matter of
fact, music publishers dpi not make
princely incomes out of songs. The
competition Is keen, the expenses are
very great and the exceptional suc
cesses very rare.
The highest price ever given for a
song Is Â£2240, which was the sum
paid last week for Mascheroni's "For
All Eternity." This song has nearly
its full term of copyright to run, and
it shares with "Queen of the Earth" the
honor of being the most popular of
modern compositions.
But it is not always quality that
brings in a handsome return. There
are many songs of exceptional merit,
both- in words and music, which are
practically a drug in the market, while,
on the other hand, songs of admitted
mediocrity have commanded extraordi
narily high prices. The music pub
j lisher who can judge of the value of a
song as soon as he sees It is a rarity.
He has to reckon with the temper and
varied tastes of the public. He must
patiently bide his time and 'let the sales
tell their own tale. *
Messrs. Puttlck & Simpson have had
a long experience in the sale of copy
rights of songs, and some figures they
supplied our representatives with yes
terday are exceedingly Interesting.
In 1871 some huge prices were paid
for songs. Balfe's "The Sailor Sighs
as Sinks His Native Shore." a duet,
fetched Â£324; Blumenthal's "Requital"
was bought for Â£310. The royalty on
this song was as much as Bd. tier copy.

Gounod's "Bethlehem," Â£198; Hatton's
"Good-by, Sweetheart. Good-by," Â£462;

Roses," Â£495; Macfarren's "Beating of
My Own Heart," Â£360; Stanley's "Only
to Lave," Â£269. In the same year
Wallace's opera "Maritana" was sold
for Â£2232, while shortly afterward
Â£2500 was paid for his opera "Lur

Some well-known songs came under
i the hammer in 1883, many of them be

Women's Suffrage in Australia.
The annual meeting of the National
Union of Women's Suffrage Societies was
held In Manchester recently. There was
a crowded attendance of delegates. Mrs.
Fawcett presided. The Hon. J. Cock
burn, Agent General for South Australia,
remarked that at one time he had some
contempt for the question of women's
suffrage, as some young. people had at
the present time, but in his wiser days
he had taken an active part in carrying
this great reform In South Australia.
[Applause.] Women's suffrage was un
doubtedly the great question of the cen
tury; in fact, he might say, it was the
great question of all time: it would ef
fect a great but very gradual change,
and he thought they hardly realized what
the change would mean. The ways of
women "Were in the direction of peace,
and If women had a voice in connection
with the Czar's proposed peace conference
there would be some chance of general
disarmament being brought about. Wo
men suffered too much from both inter
national warfare and Industrial troubles
not to be ln favof* of such struggles be
ing brought to an end. He came from a
country where women had long enjoyed
the Parliamentary franchise, and to him
it was ridiculous that such a right was
not enjoyed by the women of the- mother
country. It took ten years to win the
victory in South Australia, and the lead
ers of the movement had to encounter
great opposition. Now,, however, there
were few people in the colony who re
gretted the triumph of the women, who
since their right to the exercise of the
franchise bad been established had been
the means of Introducing very useful leg
islation. He did not think the women of
the United Kingdom v;ould have very
long to wait for what was their right,
and there were forces that were always
pressing the movement on. The Victorian
Age has been a glorious one. and one
which lie hoped would be crowned by
their endeavor succeeding and the act
taking its place on the statute book dur
ing the reign of their beloved sovereign.
[Applause.] The report was adopted. â

HIS NEMESIS
OUTWITTED
BY OLD TIME
Kinard Fails to De
pose Judge Clift.
HIS 5 TERM ENDS NATURALLY
CRIMINAL LIBEL PROCEEDINGS
ARE NOW THREATENED.
A Small Photograph in Justice Cliffs
Court Is to Be Made the
Basis of Another
Suit.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 31.
The proceedings instituted by C. E.
Kinard for the purpose of deposing Jus
tice of the Peace Fred C. Clift on the
ground of malfeasance in office were
vitally frustrated in Superior Judge Ells
worth's court this afternoon. The prime
object of the suit dies a natural death at
midnight. '"">.:; .": ' ; 7-.'v'
The case came on for trial this after
noon. C. E. Kinard appeared again in
person and conducted the prosecution,
while M. C. Chapman and Emil Nusbau
mer defended Justice Clift, who sat by
silently listening to the tedious and un
interesting testimony. .
Kinard, contrary to his intentions,
proved that Instead of not turning over
all moneys collected from fines from Jan
uary 1, 1595, until May 2, 1898, Clift had
paid over to the County Treasurer $164 50
more than he had ought to.
The prosecution then was required to |
pore over the court dockets to segregate j
each instance where he claimed the fine
money had not been turned over. This I
proved a tedious task, and by the time .
Kinard had finished the docket for 1895
Judge Ellsworth was ready .o adjourn
for the day and continued further hear
ing until next "Wednesday, notwithstand
ing the objections of the attorneys for
either side. â¢---.-.- .%.;*.: !-<f;r.-.-::'v 7
Another vital obstacle for the prosecu
tion was Kinard's inability to secure the
vouchers showing what money had been
paid in by Justice Clift. These vouchers [
had been examined by a recent Grand i
Jury and were locked up ln the rooms of .
the Supervisors, and the clerk in charge
had ended his day's work.
The action in continuing the case prac- j
tically, ends- the matter, since Kinard's
sole purpose was to depose Justice Clift, I
and in this he has failed, as this is the j
last day of Justice Cliffs term.
Kinard's proclivities as Justice Cliffs i
.Nemesis, however, are not likely to end
with the death of this suit, for he de
clares that he will now begin criminal
proceedings.
"I do not propose to give up this fight
until I have got satisfaction," said Mr.
Kinard as he left the courtroom with an
air of disgust mingled with anger.
"Those fellows have a picture of mine
stuck upon the wall in Cliffs court which j
I consider libelous, and I propose to bring
charges of criminal, libel against Clift )
sooner or later. But I shall first com- |
mence other proceedings the exact nature j
of which I decline to discuss at this time." |
The picture that Mr. Kinard refers to
is pasted on a wall in Cliffs court. It is
a photograph and labeled "C. E. Kinard."
Across one side is painted the word "em
bezzlement." To-day in court Justice |
Clift exhibited a similar, picture, and
Kinard made a desperate though futile
effort to snatch It, for he wishes to use
It In evidence In the subsequent libel; suit.
HOW TO PAY CHRISTIAN SCIEN-
TISTS' FEES.
There is one little point, however,
made by one of my correspondents
which is too good to be missed. He re
marks that the principle of the denial
of pain, and the other principles on
which Christian Science is based, logic
ally apply to other evils besides mere
bodily disease. You have an excruciat
ing pain in your big toe. Refuse to be
lieve in the pain, says the Christian
Scientist, and the pain ceases to exist.
Carry the argument a step further. You
owe Jones Â£5 (a circumstance' which
may cause you quite as much annoy
ance as a pain in your big toe). Refuse
to believe in it, and the debt cease&
to exist. There are many people who
would appear to adopt this principle in
financial matters already, much to their
comfort and advantage. It only re
mains for the Christian Science patient
to apply this principle to the Christian
Science healer. The latter charges a
guinea a week for Christian Science
treatment. Let her only by the power
of faith believe that the guinea has
been paid and there will be no necessity
for handing over cash. â London Truth.

themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development just where It is needed.
It cures all the Ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func- '
tions and has been an absolute success

SYSTEM
Cheap Mail Facilities
One of the Chief Fac-
tors in Our Pros-
perity and Pro-
gress.
"Common is the commonplace." The
most valuable of civil benefits is such a
commonplace matter that we scarcely
give it a thought. It would take a win-
ter on a whaler nipped in an ice floe to
make us truly appreciable of the worth
of the posta.l service. What a wonder-
ful thing It is! Wonderful in its organi-
zation, with its vast: machinery for the
collection and distribution of letters, its
railway mail cars, its route riders, the
unfailing order and precision of its
methods. Wonderful it Is, too, in its re-
sults. It knits together families widely
separated. It carries across the sea
some tender lover's message or perhaps
a little flower picked from the daisied
grave of an English churchyard. Every
hour of every day the commonplace
mail bag is packed with the secrets of
life, words which waken- love and
laughter, and words which deepen the
furrow in the cheek and dim the failing
sight with bitter tears. *..-.,-*:'.'
But with all this there is going on
through the mail service a dissemina-
tion of human knowledge, a reaching
out of human help which is one of the
crowning blessings of our century. The
correspondence schools led by Chautau-
qua are sending to every village and
hamlet the broader knowledge which is
so eagerly craved by many who are
shut in to the homely duties of an
humble life. . Without the mail system
this plan of education would be utterly
non-existent.
Every mail, too, carries from the
great centers the advice of great phy-
sicians, which it would be impossible
for the distant public to obtain were it
not for the mails. Few people realize
how many thousand people depend on
the mail service for medical treatment.
Not long ago when some postal affairs
were being discussed in connection with
the erection of the new postoffice build-
ing In Buffalo, N. V., some light was
thrown on this subject by the state-
ment that the mail by Dr. R. V. Pierce
amounted daily to something over 1500
pieces. Of course, this is not a common
case, because Dr. Pierces relation as
chief consulting physician to Buffalo's
famous institution, The Invalids' Hotel
and Surgical Institute, makes his advice
and that of his staff of nearly a score
of skilled and experienced specialists
much sought after, especially by
women, to the treatment and cure of
whose special diseases Dr. Pierce has
devoted over thirty years of almost
constant labor. But though this ex-
ample is out of the ordinary, it may
serve as an evidence of the amazing
benefits reaped by. the public from the'
mail service. It puts every outlaying
hamlet in .touch with the most ad-
vanced medical specialism of the day.
It gives at the cost of a 2-cent stamp
the skill and experience that it has
taken years to acquire. Literally, at
the cost of a 2-cent stamp, since Dr.
Pierce invites sick women to consult
him by letter without charge. And this
would seem to be one of the. most re-
markable services rendered by the pos-
tal system, perhaps the supreme service
of all. For while it is a splendid thing
to be able to shop in New York while
living in Kansas and a grand thing to be
able to command the learning of great
professors while working in the Michi-
gan woods, it is a still grander thing
that by means of this cheaply supplied
service men like Dr. Pierce, who have
the disposition to be helpful, are en-
abled to place their skill and knowledge
at the disposal of those who are being
dragged down by disease, without the
possibility of help from those about
them. When one contemplates the vast
and far-reaching benefits of the mail
service so briefly touched upon in this
article, it makes the familiar gray uni-
form of the postman the most glorious
of all uniforms, for it is worn by the
soldiers of the army of peace. It makes
one feel like taking his hat off to the
on-rushing mail train and cheering the
work and wisdom of Uncle Sam.

Tommy Decorates Himself to Suit.
The British soldier now on furlough in
London in large quantities is richly orna
mented with badges for service merit
Scarcely a redcoat is seen Whose arm is
not adorned either with the crossed rifles
for markmanship, the crossed swords for
gymnasium instruction, i*. the pioneer's
crossed axes, or the good conduct badge
Frequently the crossed rifles carry a star
above them. Indicating that the wearer is
the crack shot of his company. From this
profusion of merit decoration It might be
justifiably inferred that the obtaining of
honors in the army is a very easy matter
or that the private soldier is a much more
zealous Individual than is universally sus
pected.
Through inquiries made by a Daily Mail
representative the reason for this boom
in badges 'has been discovered, and It Is
simple vanity, for many of the badges
have not been won or earned. If Tommy
Atkins had not. yet gained a sleeve orna
ment to display on furlough he will buy
one and stitch it on his tunic. If he be
leaving Aldershbt for instance, he enters
the train an ordinary soldier and by the
aid of a needle and thread and a comrade,
perhaps, he leaves the station at London
with a decorated arm that would become
the waist of the smartest housemaid In
Kensington.

points are frequently changed. The oest

COIN QUESTIONSâ J. C, Vancouver,
B. C; S. H. S., Mrs. M. H., City; M. A.
McL., Marshfield, Or.; and Subscriber,
San Jose, Cal. The coinage of silver half
dimes ceased -in 1573, act of February 12;
the only silver half-dimes that command
a premium are those issued in 1794-95-96-97;
1800-01-02-03-04-05, 1838 without stars, 1546.
There is no premium offered for a $5
gold piece of 1846 nor for a $2 50 piece of
1850. The selling price of the former ia
$7 50 and of the latter $4 50.
The figures in the letter of inquiry are
not as clearly made as they should be. If
the writer has a 50-cent piece of 1827 then
the coin, if in good condition, will bring
a premium of from $30 to $50. but if the
date is 1829 then the coin is worth but 50
cents.
A half-dollar of ISO 9 does not command a
premium.
If the half-dollar of 1853 you have is one
with arrows at the date and rays around
the eagle it does not command a premium,
but if it is without arrows at date or rays
around the eagle it will command a pre
mium of $20 to $30; ;
TIDE AND OVERFLOWED LANDSâ
Subscriber, Eureka, Cal. Tide land is
such land as is affected by the tide; land
which is alternately covered and left
dry by the ordinary flux and reflux of the
tides. Swamp and overflowed lands are
within the meaning of the act of
Congress of September 28, 1850. granting
swamp and overflowed lands to the
States, such lands as periodically over
flow at seasons of sowing and harvesting
and are rendered unfit for the cultivation
of the staple crops.
The question, "What does each produce
in an unimproved state?" is too general
to admit of an answer. If the inquiry is
limited to- a particular district or local
ity the information can probably be fur
nished. â â  , .
Swamp and overflowed lands were ac
quired by the act of Congress of 1850 to
enable the State to dispose of It to such
as wish to buy and reclaim the same.'
As to what rights you would have in
the matter of filing on such lands in Cali
fornia, you would have to communicate
with the office of the Surveyor General
at Sacramento.
CHAMPAGNEâ R. V. City. The dis
covery of champagne is said to be due to
a Benedictine monk named Perlgon, who
in 1668 was made cellarer. In pursuing the
duties of his position he hit upon the idea
of "marrying" the different wines pro
duced in the vineyard; one he noted had
fragrance, another imparted generosity
and the blackest were found to produce
a white wine that kept good instead of
turning yellow, as that made from white
grapes. The white or gray wines of cham
pagne became famous, and the wine from
his district, Hautviller, the most famous
of all. Perigon also discovered that the
old stopper of flax dipped in oil could be
replaced with cork. He finally evolved
the effervescing wine that was far mora
pleasant than the old style still wine. The
King gave the seal of royal approval to
the new discovery. Le Marquis de Sillery
at a supper introduced the wine into the
court circle. The flower wreathed bottles
which, at a given signal, a dozen bloom
ing damsels, draped in the guise of
Bacchanals, placed upon the table, were
hailed with rapture. Thenceforth spark
ling wines were an indispensable adjunct
to all the court suppers of the period.
MUSHROOM GARDENINGâ A. O. S.,
City. Mushrooms are not raised from
seeds, but from spawn,- which is sold in,
bricks and is used In the following man
ner: A quantity of good horse manure
is made into a heap, which must be fre
quently turned for a fortnight, until the
rankness has disappeared. It Is then built
into rounded beds four feet wide and from
a foot to four feet in height, according
to the fancy of the planter. It is built
up of alternate layers of the manure and
clayey loam. If made high the layers of
manure are one foot in thickness and the"
clay four inches. These are made into
beds, as they are called, from ten to fifty
feet in length. â  They are covered by a
shed. When the beds are made they are
covered with either straw or hay for ten
days, after which that is removed and
an inch thick of very flne loam is placed
on the bed. On this is planted the spawn,
broken into pieces the size of a walnut,
in rows six inches apart. Then the spawn,
is covered with another inch of flne loam
or mold. If .the mold is too dry, it is
sprinkled with tepid water, and in about
five or six weeks the mushrooms appear.
There is a great deal of detail In the cul
tivation of mushrooms, which is explained
In books davoted to the fungus, and it Is
not every amateur who can make a suc
cess in that line. -â 'â¢-'.

GRASPING THE
FIRST FRUITS
OF VICTORY
Supervisor Phelps Works a Bluff
and Turns Britt, Haskins and
"Cappun" Delany Green
With Envy.
How the New Member of the Supervi
sorial License Committee Won From
J. J. Groom a Pass to the Green-
Creed on Contest.
SUPERVISOR - ELECT PHELPS is
happy, happy in the possession of
official power and of some of the
fruits that come with public au
thority. Many who witnessed the
Green-Creedon fight on Friday night may
have seen the beaming and self-sat
. countenance of the Supervisor. Many
may have seen his patronising, "Cappun
Delany" look of official superiority as
he reflected with himself that he had as
serted his Supervisorial dignity before it
belonged to him and had received a pass
that admitted him a spectator to the
match of pugs.
Supervisor Phelps has broken a munici
l.pal record. lie has distanced even the
swaggering "Cappun" and his odorous as
: sociates of the "Solid Eight." It will be
. remembered that the official gall of the
7 "Cappun" swelled within him and he
forced his way and that of some of his
friends without paying into the Pavilion
.where Green tried to fight Wolcott. But
that was when the "Cappun" had aSuper
â ;.-"yisorial vote and it was policy to endure
this presence. Supervisor Phelps has de
'nianded the same privilege before his de
. voted shoulders have been enveloped in
'-â  the mantle of the "Cappun." The result
of Mr. Phelps' demand was some what
different from those that followed De
lany's raid. The story is not uninter
esting.
Mr. Phelps Ingenuously feels that he is
already a public character, not a public
mark, and that everybody beyond the.
neighborhood in which he lives already
knows him. Incidentally Mr. Phelps has
received the honor of a caucus nomina
. tion of a place upon the License Commit
tee of the new Board ofSupervisors. This
committee is the court of judgment for
pugs and their managers. Without the
indorsement of this committee prize fight
ers would have to try to earn a decent
living or elevate the morals of the city
by going somewhere else.
On Friday 'night Mr. Phelps was bend
ing the willing hinges of his arm in a
Powell street resort and he reflected upon
these facts. lie was in three days to be
come one of the arbiters of prize fighters
and their local existence. The Supervisor
was ln company that speaks for itself.
He was with the "Cappun" and with two
men very well known to local ill fame as
', ex-Supervisors Brit* and Haskins.
With these apt tutors at his elbow Su
pervisor Phelps worked a bluff that made
the "Cappun" almost faint and forced
Britt and Haskins to grab the bar for
support. Phelps caught a glimpse of J.
J. Groom, who is one-half of the National
Athletic Club, which was to present
Green and Creedon to an admiring public
that night. Phelps, with some dignity,
walked toward Groom and bowed severe
ly to him. "I suppose you know me,"'
said the new member of the Licence Com
mittee, patronizingly.
Groom is an adept in what Is commonly
called the "bull con." He knows every
body who wants to buy a ticket and no
bod v who wants a pass to see a fight.
"Oh, yes; 1 know you," he replied.
"Clad to see you. How are you?"
The new member of the License Com
mittee was not concerned about his
health. He* Insidiously remarked about
the License Committee and then looked
for a gleam of answering intelligence,
sometimes expressed in a wink, from
Groom. The manager's face was as
blank as that of a Chinese peddler with
out a license tag. Groom refused to un
derstand. Phelps went further. With an
admirable imitation of the "Cappun's" air
of unconcern he spoke of the duties of
the License Committee and of his pros
pective labors as a very energetic mem
ber of it.
Groom's blank russ faded into a look of
horror. He was talking to a member of
the new committee.
"Oh, yes," he declared, extending his
bands and grasping one of Phelps' effu
sively. "Oh, yes. of course, you areâ"
Groom hesitated. The game would not
â¢work.
"I am Supervisor Phelps," the other in
terrupted. "I am a member of the
License Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors," am. he looked disdainfully at
the "Canpun."
A look of despair surplanted that of

horror in the face of Groom, who placed
his hand over the pocket where he keeps
his tickets. The new member of the
License Committee continued:
"I and some of my friends would like
to see the fight to-night."
There was no escape. "How many
tickets?" asked Groom resignedly.
He cannot distinctly recall the answer.
His dazed condition at the time was re
sponsible. Somebody said the answer
sounded like "a hatful."
Groom dove into his pocket and handed
the new member of the License Commit
tee one pass admitting him to see the
Green-Creedon fight. And that was why
Supervisor Phelps that night beamed in
self-satisfaction and mused on the glories i
of official power. But the "Cappun" will j
never forgive Ids pupil for that one pass.
The "Cappun's" mantle has fallen, and
w ; hen be attends a prizefight in future it j
will hot be in swaggering authority, but
as some Supervisor's rinds." The "Cap- |
pun" is convinced that Phelps should
have demanded "the hatful."
Pickpockets Caught.
While looking in a show window on
Market street last night J. Loekriter felt
a young man insert his hand in his pocket
and steal his watch. He immediately
grabbed the thief and after a short strug
gle threw him down. â¢ He then held him
until Policeman Murphy arrived. The I
thief was then handcuffed and taken to |
the City Prison. He gave his name as I
George Meader and claimed he lived in j
Oakland.
He was booked on a charge of grand !
larceny.
An eld woman named Mrs. Burke, liv
ing at 21134 Lilly avenue, had her pocket
picked last night of a purse containing
$1 while standing in a crowd at Sixth and
Howard streets. She suspects a young
man who brushed against her as she min

insanity immediately. Of course that's
all nonsense. There are many odd meth
ods of diagnosing such cases, however.
In locomotor ataxia the patient cannot
walk with his' eyes shut. In incipient
paresis there is difficulty In articulating
particular letters, and one famous sci
entist used to make his patients say
'national intelligencer.' A man with an
incipient case of the disease can't pro
nounce these words distinctly to save his
soul. Another very eminent practitioner
employed 'truly rural' for the same pur
pose. If you have paresis I would advise
you not to say 'truly rural,' at least not
in company. The 'knee jerk' test Is well
known to physicians. To apply it, the
legs are crossed and a sharp blow struck
just below the knee of the limb that is
swinging loose. If the subject is all right
there will be a prompt reflex action; in
other words, his foot will 11 v up in spite
of all efforts to keep It quiet. If not,
there is something wrong. And that re
minds me of a tragic incident which oc
curred in a Southern court not many
years ago. A man was being examined
for insanity, and one of the lawyers made
the experts the butt of a great deal of
ridicule. He scoffed particularly at the
knee jerk test and asked to have it ap- 1
plied to himself. There was no reflex
action, and the fact had a powerful ef
fect on the jury, especially as the lawyer
happened to be a man of brilliant attain
ments. After the trial he got to "think
ing about the matter, and in spite of his
skepticism concluded to submit to a thor
ough private examination. It was made,
and discovered unmistakable signs of lo
comotor ataxia, dooming him to a certain
and lingering death."â New Orleans

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 1, 1899.
DONS HIS ROBES, BUT
SOON HE DOFFS THEM
Judge Sweeney Presides for a Day, With
Much Judicial Dignity.
A Wise and Just Judge Even If He Be
Woefully Short of Time and Years
and Stature. *
Eddie M. Sweeney, who was elected
I Judge of the Police Court for the unex
pired term caused by the death of Judge
Campbell, has the distinction of being
the youngest, smallest and shortest-term
Judge that has ever presided in a court of
justice, at least in California. It might
be added th;" ****â¢ is the most dignified.
Courtroom No. 1 was packed to the
doors yesterday morning with the friends
of the young Judge and others who were
present in the expectation that there
would be lots of fun, but they were very
much disapDoi f -d. Sweeney has a lot
of mother-wit, but lie knows when to use
I it and when to keep it under cover.
Barney Curran was the bailiff of the
i court and long John Church, who stands
: seven feet two inches in his stockings,
; was his assistant. Church's services were
; dispensed with soon after the court open
ed as the Judge came to the conclusion
that he was more ornamental than use
ful. Howard Vernon was stenographer
i and Fred McGregor prosecuting attorney.
Shortly after 10 o'clock the Judge, lean
ing on the arm of Justice of the Peace
Barry, entered the courtroom and his ap
: pearance was the signal for wild applause.
Which continued until ho took his seat
on the bench. He looked like a boy as he
sat in the big arm chair and the majority
ln the courtroom thought that a good time
was coming.
Justice of the Peace Barry, in a few
pertinent remarks, introduced the Judge
and when he concluded he was greeted
with rousing cheers. As tho young Judge
rose from his chair there was absolute si
lence. His first words put a damper on
the hilarious. "1 am a young man," he
said, "and the citizens have honored me
by electing me as a Police Judge for the
unexpired term, but although 1 will only
hold court for a day I want you all to dis
tinctly understand that this is not a play
house but a court of justice. I am here
to administer justice, to punish the guilty
and free the innocent. I thank you for
your kindly reception, but I want you to
understand that on the slightest sign of
disturbance I will order the bailiff to clear
the courtroom."
He had ten cases on his calendar and
the first was Michael Dwyer, charged
with being drunk and disturbing the
peace of his family. Michael pleaded
guilty and the Judge remarked: "I am
sorry for you. Michael. You have a nice
mother at home, out you make life a
burden to her. I think you would like to
enjoy the hospitality extended 'the guests
at the County Jail."
"Well, Judge," said Michael, "anything
you say goes." The Judge gave him three
, months and Michael returned his thanks.
Jane McAlister, a disreputable old
woman, arrested for vagrancy, was next
FINDS FAME AND FORTUNE
A Local Girl Whose Voice Has Carried Her
Around the World and Back to a
Rich Gold Mine.
ANOTHER San Francisco girl has been winning laurels oil the concert and
operatic stage. It is Mme. Fried, who, as Agnes Wolff, was at one time
quite prominent in local amateur musical circles. She left San Fran
cisco as a young widow to visit a sister in Shanghai about four years
ago. From that time she has devoted herself to professional work, in
which she has achieved splendid success, and to study under the best masters,
study which she can now carry to greater perfection since it was discovered
a few weeks ago that she was mistress of a gold mine near Auburn, in Placer
County, the remnant of a small estate left her by her husband, in which pros
pectors* have discovered very rich ore. .". -
Mme. Fried's introduction to the professional world was made under the aus
pices of Chevalier de Konski. The great pianist heard her sing at various con
certs in Shanghai and was charmed with her voice. At his suggestion she joined
him in a tour of Japan and the European settlements of China.
Mme. Fried later sailed for Vancouver, where her voice attracted the notice
of Lady Colin C. Campbell, who sought to take. her to London by way of India."
Mme. Fried declined the proffered kindness, and started for New York by the
Canadian Pacific Railway to see her little girl, whom. she had left three years
before at Banff.
In Boston and New York she was as successful in opera as on the concert
stage. She was assisting at musicales with Mrs. Frank Leslie at Sherry's when
she received letters asking her to put a price on "her mine" in Placer County.
This being the first intimation that the property was of more than nominal va.ue
she at first put her affairs in the hands of J. Redding, who corresponded with
various mining experts, with the result that he offered . to advance the money
necessary to develop the mine for a half interest in it. This woke Mme. Fried
up to its value. So she packed her things and started for California to see for
herself what would be best. * She arrived in San Francisco on Wednesday even
ing. . ' - y -'y. y . "."7.%"-: ",,â ;*,
Mme. Fried is still young, and is very attractive. Her voice Is a rich so
prano of great. strength and compass, its particular, charm being the ease with
which she sings her high notes and the distinctness and lack of affectation
with which she ? enunciates. She studied in San Francisco under Mme. Julie
Rosewald/ and ; has i been studying with the best artists in New York.
on the list. The arresting officer declared
that he had only known Jane for a day,
and the Judge took the ground that it
would be an Infringement on the rights
of the people if an arrest could be made
for vagrancy on a day's acquaintance.
He suggested that the officer should
swear out a warrant for vulgar language,
but the officer declined. "Do you make.
a motion to dismiss?" asked the Judge.
"I do," promptly replied Jane, and the
Judge said. "The motion of the defendant
is granted."
F. Boffinger, a "bum," who said he was
a waiter, was charged with begging and
insulting people at Third and Mission
streets. He pleaded not guilty, but the
evidence was against him. In answer to
the Judge he said he lived in the Milton
House, and the Judge replied that he |
knew he must be a "dope fiend." By
adroit questioning Boffinger was induced
to admit he was a slave to yen shee, and -
the Judge told him he had better go to j
the County Jail for three months to fat- j
ten up.
George Clark was charged with disturb- I
Ing the peat of Chinatown. He admitted
he bad swallowed four glasses of Chinese '
gin and it had such an effect upon him
that he began to yell "murder. ' The
Judge solemnly abjured him not to drink
Chinese gin again, and George put up his
right hand and took the oath not to
taste a drop of liÂ«uor during 1899. The
Judge allowed him to go on his own
recognizance for five days, and warned
him that if he was again arrested he
would get six months.
Emma Taylor, a colored woman, was
arrested for vagrancy. The Judge had
defended her on previous occasions, and
when she stood up she blushed and held j
down her head. "You will have to leave
town, Emma," said the Judge. "I will j
give you five days, and if you are not. !
away by that time you will be arrested i
and punished." Emma promised faith
fully to leave.
After the cases were disposed of At- I
torney McGregor paid a glowing tribute
to the young Judge for the ability he had
shown and the courtesies he had extend
ed to the members of the bar. He ex
pressed the hope that when the next elec
tion came along the Judge would be
elected for a two-year term. McGregor
was loudly applauded.
Judge Sweeney returned his thanks. He
said he had remarked to the late Judge
Campbell two years ago that he might
hold the same position in the same court
room, and he hoped he. would do so with
the same dignity and impartiality. If
elected for a two-year term he would
be true to the trust reposed in him and
would deal out justice talrly and Im
partially. He fully realized the responsi
bility of the office of Police Judge and he
hoped the other Judges had as full a
sense of their responsibility. He asked
them not to applaud after he had finished
his remarks as it was not seemly' in a
*
court of justice, and when he concluded
his wish was respected.
After the court adjourned the young
Judge's spirit of fun asserted itself.
Counselor N. S. Wirt importuned him to
sign an "O. R." for the release of an old
vagrant named Annie Smith. Wirt prom
ised that he would take Annie to Vallejo.
Sweeney signed the order In Wirt's name
and. Wirt, who is very shortsighted, did
not know the difference. He hurried to
the City Prison with the order and was
thrown out.
Judge Sweeney will dispose of the
"drunks" this morning and to-morrow
morning and Tuesday will . occupy the
bench until noon, when he will give way
to Judge Mogan.
Much comment was made yesterday
that none of the other Judges introduced
him and that Justice of the Peace Barry
had to be called upon to officiate.
THREE HOURS' WORK
FOR TEN DOLLARS
THE ELECTION COMMISSIONERS
MAKE PRESENTS.
Unexpired Terms Counted and the
Six Ballot Clerks Given Mu
nificent New Year
Presents.
The end of the term clean-up fever that
has been killing off the available cash
supply at the City Hall attacked the
Election Sommissioners, and the result
was a hemorrhage of dollars all through
the department: The six men who have
been working themselves to death three
hours each day at counting, the tally
sheets turned in from the late election,
came first. Their labors began on No
vember 15 and continued intermittently
until Thursday morning last. The aver
age time worked has not averaged four
days a week, yet when the Commissioners
adjourned yesterday it was after voting
$10 per day for the full forty-five days to
each of their overworked ballot counters.
Registrar Piggy is much incensed at so
generous a New Year's : gift. He has so
conducted his office that San Francisco's
late election cost the tax-payers less
than any other of lamented history. He
closed his affairs this year with a tidy
balance of cash on hand, and the late mu
nificent gifts of the Commissioners have
practically cleaned it up.
A BIG SUIT ENDS.
Claus Spreckels Bests the Hawaiian
Commercial Company.
The suit recently instituted by the Ha
waiian Commercial Company of Honolu
lu against Claus Spreckels to recover val
uable lands in the islands recently an
nexed to the "United States has been set
tled. By the settlement Mr. Spreckels
has received $110,000, and the terms of the
settlement contain a vindication of the
attitude assumed by Mr. Spreckels
against the claims of his sons, C. A. and
Rudolph, who were formerly officers of
the Hawaiian Commercial Company,
plaintiff in the action.
The plaintiff corporation originally se
cured a lease to 28,000 acres of crown
lands. At about the same time Claus
Spreckels purchased the interest of the
Princess Ruth in the crown lands, paying
her $10,000 and executing to her in addi
tion a loan of 60,000. After purchasing
the rights of the Princess Mr. Spreckels
concluded to bring suit to quiet title. A
compromise was the result, and by the
terms of the compromise Mr. Spreckels
received a title in fee simple to the 28,
--000 acres In question and 6000 acres more
near the lands of the Hawaiian Commer
cial Company. .
Subsequently the Hawaiian Commercial
Company, set up claim to the 0000 acres
mentioned, and two years ago C. A. and
Rudolph Spreckels instituted a suit
against their father to recover it. Re
cently the claims of the Spreckels broth
ers passed from their hands to those of
a corporation of sugar plantation owners,
and they, realizing the unjust claim of
the" Spreckels brothers, ordered that the
suit be dismissed. This was done, and
Mr Spreckels has recently sold. the lands
in question to the new corporation for the
sum of $110,000. , ,? 77
BOAST OF THEIR " PULL."
Two Female Pickpockets Released
by Judge Sweeney.
Captain Spillane is indignant over the
action of Judge Sweeney in releasing
Kittle Fitzgibbon and May, alias Dene,
Smith, two of the most notorious female
pickpockets in the country, on their own
recognizance.
Friday night the women were arrested
while in the act of robbing a stranger
who is staying at the Palace Hotel. After
being taken Into custody the Smith wo
man boasted of her "pull" and threat
ened to "break" the arresting officer.
Notwithstanding that Judge Sweeney was
informed of the character of the women i
he ordered them released on their own :
recognizance.
Several nights ago the same women
robbed a recent arrival from the East of
$CO, but as he was anxious to leave the
city he refused to swear to a complaint
against them. It is the intention of Cap
tain Spillane to vigorously prosecute the
women, and he earnestly hopes to be able
to secure a coonvictlon.
