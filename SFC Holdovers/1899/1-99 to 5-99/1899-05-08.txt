RETURN OF HEROES
FROM MANILA BAY
NEW YORK. May 7.â Flying a home
ward bound pennant 236 feet long, the
cruiser Buffalo came into port this
morning after a record-breaking run
from Manila. She brought 596 officers
and men from Dewey's Meet, more than
half of whom participated in the battle
of Manila Way. The men are those
whose terms of enlistment have ex
pired.
Among the officers were Paymaster
John R. Martin, Captain Dutton of the
marine corps. Lieutenant A. G,, Rogers
of the Monadnork. Lieutenant S. S.
Robinson of the Boston, Surgeon E.
Rogers of the Monterey, Surgeon R. S.
Blackman of the Boston, Ensign Ste
phen Douglas of the Monadnock, En
sign F. S. Wilson of the Monadnock.
Knsign Lang and nine naval cadets
who came home to take (he spring ex
aminations at Annapolis.
Captain Hemphill, who took the
Buffalo out to Manila on December
7th with more men for Dewey, brought
the cruiser home in forty-four days,
including stops at Singapore, Pore
Said and Gibraltar. The actual sail
ing time was thirty-seven days, an
average speed for the trip of 13 1-4
knots an hour. Fine weather was had
all the way except after leaving Gib
raltar, when the Buffalo ran into a
series of southwest gales, which made
hÂ«'r roll heavily.
Captain Hemphill said that, he ran
from New York to Manila In fifty
three days after the two breakdowns
on the start, and that was considered
a big feat. He could have brought the
Buffalo home in thirty-seven days, but
the bottom became fouled and this de
layed her. with the added detention of
three days In docking at Singapore.
The cruiser was In Manila Bay about
six weeks and left there on March 23.
The captain, like every other officer in
the service, is enthusiastic about Ad
miral Dewey.
On the Buffalo are forty-nine seamen
who were on Dewey's flagship, the
Olympia, when Montijo's fleet was
sunk, fifty-five from the Baltimore,
seven from the Concord, ninety from
the Boston, fourteen from the Petrel
and forty-two marines. Some of these
men have served twelve months or
more since their term of enlistment ex
pired. There are men on the Buffalo
who have not been in the United States
Cor tiv or six years. To-morrow all of
these men will be discharged and jiaid
off at the navy yard.
Th>- men on the Buffalo brought home
a choice collection of mascots, including
monkeys, pigs and goats. The Buffalo
has two six-inch guns from the Reina
Christina, Montijo's flagship, which are
Intended for the Smithonian Institu
tion, as well as the wheel from the
the same ship, the bell of the Isle de
Cuba, some torpedoes and a great
quantity of guns and old brass can

DETERMINED TO BRING HOME
COLORADO VOLUNTEERS
DEN'VRR, May 7. â Governor Thomas
has announced that within a few days,
if President McKinley and the Secre
tary of War continue to ignore his com
munications on. the subject of the re
turn of the Colorado regiment from the
Philippines, he will take stops with a
view to securing the immediate recall
of the troops.
"I can not, as yet, pay what course I
BhaU follow," he said, "but I will ex
haust every resourre at my command
to bring those boys home. I have tried
quiet, peaceable means and have failed.
Now I will be obliged to resort to some
thing more forcible, and it will be made
public. Of course I do not desire to
take any action that will unjustly ham
per the administration, for I am an
American, but I do not propose to sit
idly by and see the volunteers from
Colorado fighting and dying in the
Philippines in defense of the policy
which is actuating those in charge of
the movements of our armies abroad.
"In thf* first plac* the volunteer
troops are being detained illegally and
in defiance of the constitution. They
enlisted for the Spanish war. That war
is over and still they are detained in
those far-off islands.
"Under- the constitution the Colorado [
volunteers would be perfectly justified
in laying down their arms where they
are and in returning to the United. J
States. If they should do anything like !
that probably they muld be court
martialed and punished, under the
strict law of military rule, but in that
event this same military rule would be
placed above the constitution of our
Republic."
It is regarded as possible that in the
event of the failure of any "public at
tempt" which may be made to bring
about the return of the troops the Gov
ernor will resort to legal proceedings.
Tf such proves to be the case the Su
preme Court of the United States may
be called upon to decide a test case re
garding the powers of the President
and that provision of the constitution
relating to the purposes for which vol- I
unteer soldiers may be called into eer- !
vice.
DEWEY SATISFIED TO
REMAIN AN ADMIRAL
NEW YORK, May 7.â Commander
Hemphlll of the cruiser Buffalo, which
arrived from Manila to-day, when
asked "What about Admiral Dewey and
the Presidency?" said:
â¢'lt was in the Paris edition of the
Herald. I think, that I saw how Ad
miral Dewey expressed himself on that
subject. I have no information per
sonally as to the matter, although I
fancy that Admiral Dewey may feel
cauch as General Sherman did. General
Sherman, you will remember, always
maintained that he preferred the army
to any other public duty, and it may
be that Admiral Dewey feels the same
way ab/jut the navy."
Ensign Douglass of the Buffalo said:
"It seemed to be the feeling among
the men at Manila that Admiral Dewey
now occupjea a position entirely to his
liking- He is a naval man, and the
feeling there is that his place in his
tory would not be more secure if he
were to serve as President fifty times.
For that reason it is felt that he would
not accept the nomination if it should
be tendered him."
DEWEY ACCEPTS A

PARAPHERNALIA GONE
Undiscouraged Pythians Preparing
to Entertain the Grand
Lodge.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, May 7.â Crowds have
been around the Odd Fellows' building
all day viewing what remains of this
fine structure. It was 5 o'clock this
morning, after over five hours of fight
ing, when the firemen quit work. Most
of this time five streams of water had
been turned upon the building. The
town clock, which was in the tower of
the building, struck for the- last time at
1 o'clock. The clock had done service
since 1875.
What remains of the building is a
wreck. Nothing remains of the roof,
nor "f the elegant banquet room that
occupied the entire third floor and
which has been the scene of many a
feast and social gathering. In the new
portion of the building â three stories in
height, of brickâ the fire raged the hot
test. Not much of the furnishing was
saved. Here is situated the main lodge
room, considered one of the finest out
side of San Francisco. The other lodge
room aiso is a complete wreck. Nothing
was saved except the charter. Many of
the lodges lost their records. San Lo
renzo Lodge of Odd Fellows and Bran
ciforte Lodge of Odd Fellows are the
heaviest losers as regards parapher
nalia.
The Knights of Pythias especially
feel their loss, as they are to entertain
the Grand Lodge next week. Despite
the fire they will be in readiness to en
tertain their visiting brethren on an ex
tensive scale. They had recently pur
chased a new set of regalia. This was
saved. The silver water service won as
a trophy at Stockton some years ago by
Avalon Uniform Rank ih the competi
tive drill was destroyed, together with
all the richly-engrossed resolutions pre
sented by the Grand Lodge after the
session in this city some years a^o.

SPOKANE. May 7.â Not to be
outdone by the military authori
ties at Manila and West Indian
points. General Merriam has es
tablished press censorship at
Wardner. Lieutenant Bennett,
General Merriam's aid, has been
detailed as military censor. To
day Lieutenant Bennett refused
to permit newspaper correspond
ents to send out the names of
strikers who have turned State's
evidence and exposed the ring
leaders in the recent rioting.
SPOKANE, May 7.â The mines of
Shoshone County, Idaho, that propose
to operate during the reign of rnarcial
law may do so only on condition that
they do not employ members of the
Coeuf d'Alene miners' union. This is
the martial law as laid down by Gen
eral Merriam and Attorney General
Hayes of Idaho. At a meeting of the
mine-owners in this city to-day-
Mr. Hayes presented this mandate.
The owners cheerfully promised to
obey.
"We are going to clean up thi Coeur
d'Al-nes," said Attorney General Hayes
prior to his departure for Boise. "I
have seen some of the mine-owners to
day and they have been infoimed by
the proper authorities that they can
not employ any one connected with a
criminal organization in the county.
The miners' union in Shoshone County
contains 1 many desperate characters
and criminals who have, under the pro
tection of the union, perpetrated crimes
and outrages. Twice h-- it been neces
sary because of these men and their or
ganization to put the country under
martial law. We want to put a stop to
that sort of thing.
"The owners living in Spokane allow
the union to run things, and when
property is threatened or riots occur
as a result they wire to the Governor
or Idaho to send troops to protect their
property. Some of these mine-owners
know who the men were who left their
mines to go up to Wardner for the pur
pose of blowing up the Bunker Hill and
Sullivan mi 1. They allowed the men to
go out of the mines to destroy the prop
erty of another and then to return to
work.
"We have undertaken as large - Job2
of criminal prosecution as was ever
commenced in the history of this coun
try. . rying between TOO and son men
Is a task of enormous magnitude. We
propose to push the prosecution vigor
ously, however. I am obliged to go
back to Boise for a few days on official
business, but will be back in about a
week and expect to spend the entire
summer in the Coeur d'Alenes. . Pris
oners will he tried in both the State and
Federal courts. Murder and arson are
two of th^ charges the State will brine
against these men, and we hope to in
flict extreme penalties. The State and
Federal authorities are working amic
ably together in the matter and will aid
each other as much as possible.
"Something was done in this strike
that was never before done in the his
tory of the United States. A single
company was sent into a district to
cope with 1000 rioters. I refer to the
company of the Twenty-fourth Infan
try from Spokane, commanded by Cap
tain Bachelor. It was necessary to in
trust this one company with the duty.

enough.
'It does not seem to he generally un

the mill. He had heard a report that
the mill was to be Mown up. but had
received no confirmation of the report
when !;â¢â  called on the President at 5
p. m. on Saturday for tr >o] B. '
To-day's meeting of the Coeur
d'Alene mine-owners was hÂ« i.i at the
offices of Finch <Â£â¢ Campbell. It was
called at the request of Attorney G-ei -
eral Hayes, who desired to lay bi
th.- owners the mandate of the State
and Federal authoritiesâ thai union
miners could not be ci the
region.
"Mr. Hayes laid before us the ruline
that union men must not be employed."
said Mr Finch, after the meeting. He
said, further, that the State authorities
would ex our i >n. and we
told him they would have it. Of course
we cannot set men right away, and we
do not propose to go out and look for
them. We are going to wait and see
if 'hey come to us. There are certainly
a great many good men in the union.
but as Mr. Hayet I when we told
him this, if they
can disavow their allegiance to the
unions and cro to work. Until men suffi
cient to operate the mines come in, the
mines will have to remain closed
down."

Excuse for ao ExorbitaQt
Demand.
PEKING, May 7.-The French Minister, M. Pichon, has demanded min
ing concessions to the value of 1,200,000 taels in the province of Sze Cnuan,
one of the largest in China, and traversed by the Yanp-Tse-Kianpr. as in
demnity for the recent imprisonment of a French missionary. The de
mand is considered exorbitant.
The Chinese say that the existing conditions of rebellion are not due
to any lack of energy on the part of the Government, which has fre
quently consulted the French Minister regarding the best means of ob
taining the freedom of the priest in question.
According to advices from Bankau. capital of the province of Ho-Pe,
the Russians contemplate taking definite action with reference to prop
erty now owned by the British subjects in the Russian Jardine concession.

affair threatened to interfere seriously with the Peking-Hankow Railway
project and the dismissal of the Russian official is considered to be the
only remedy.

DULUTH, Minn., May 7.â The damage

Two womeji were hurt, one being cut in

struck in the back by a stone.
Strikers or their sympathizers stole a
switch point this afternoon, causing a
ci ssation of operations on the part ol
I road. The danger to passengers and the
damage to property were so serious that
tlu- company abandoned all cars ai ik
o'clock. The police made but one arrest,
that of a small boy.
Strikers are intimidating Mrs. Led air,
with whom the non-union men are board- I
ing. A committee of the ex-employes of
the company visited the boarding house
and made overtures to buy the new men
off and get them to leave the employ of
the company. Mrs. Leclair's barn was
fired on Saturday night, but no damage ;
was done.
The committee of business men re- I
ported tn the Mayor to-day that it was

lieved from further duty. The strikers
attended church in a body, both morning '
and evening.

avoid all difficulties -the individual should

I and not allow the Assessor to place an ar
i bitrary assessment on property. The fact
that a man is a seafarin^ man doea not
exempt him from the operation of the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. May 7.â The Chinese Empress
intends to make a show of authority in
Manchuria, where several outbreaks havj
occurred between Chinese farmers and
Russian soldiers. Russia has absolute y.
control over rights of way for her r;MI->r
way enterprises, but is otherwise sup
posed to observe local customs and lami
titles. The Empress now proposes to
drill a large body of men south of Peking
i and later transfer them to Manchuria,
; where they will guard Chinese interests
from Russian aggression. %
To this end orders 'have been received
by Yu Hsien, acting Tartar general of
Nanking, commanding him to arm Rnd
drill at once all Tartar troops in Liang
kiang provinces according to modern
methods, arms and ammunition to be sup
plied by Viceroy- Liu. The same instruc
tions have been sent to Tartar generals at
Hangchow and Foochow. According to
the latest census there were over D0,00<)
Tartar soldiers in the three viceroy-
The Empress Dowager is anxious to
give Yu Hsien special military authority
1 in Liangkiang provinces, independent of
1 the Viceroy at Nanking, and this is the
first step toward that end. Doubts are
! expressed as to the value of such a move,
lowing to this official's Inexperience in
military matters and in handling large
bodies of men. - -. ,
Jung Liv, generalissimo of all the force 3
in Chihili province, has received the ex
press commands of the Empress Dowager
â to mass all the troops under bis com
mand in June next in the southern hunt-
Ing park, where they are to unite with
! the Peking field force and the new and
. old imperial guards in a grand review be
fore the Empress Dowager. It is com
puted that nearly 200,000 well-armed men
will be under arms on this occasion. At
Shanghai it is considered likely the
Empress may seize this opportunity to A
proclaim a new Emperor. â¢

" Dear Friexd â Two years ago I had
child-bed fever and womb trouble in
its worse form. For eight months after
birth of babe I was not able to sit up.
Doctors treated me, but with no help.
I had bearing-down pains, burning in
stomach, kidney and bladder trouble
and my back was so stiff and sore, the
right ovary was badly affected and
everything I ate distressed me, and
there was a bad discharge.
I was confined to my bed when I :
wrote to you for advice and followed
your directions faithfully, taking
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, Liver Pills and using the Wash,
j and am now able to do the most of my
housework. I believe I should have
died if it had not been for your Com-
pound. I hope this letter may be the
result of benefltting some other suffer-

Replying specifically to other questions I
set out by the President the court says:
That the canr.ed beef was described as !

meat tvas not o-li cr stole. That the refriger- i

The charges of General Miles, made in

made* before the War Investigating Com- .
mission, are referred to at length. arnon<
them being tbe interview with the Gen- ;
era! ?er.t uut from the New York office
of the Associated Press on January 31,
::: which General Miies was quoted as
saying that he hr.d "overwhelming eyi- \
dence that th. - beef was treated with
chrmicais t.-Â» preserve it sir.'! that he had
'affidavits frcm men who raw the beef
undergoing the embalming process." The '
I court notes the denial which General:
Miles made on this p;>r: of the conversa
tion as it was printed In the New York
i Herald, but prints the charge as a part
of the allegations, saying on this point:
The testimony of both Mr. Hri.i an-I Mr. |
Berry o.' the Now York T:n:'Â« agr-r in tha
i verity of the Interview a.* reported by the
former, and tills Is found in the i*-'riM c!;;

rarr.cra; h; but treats it a.* fart cf the allega- :
tlor.s which are un-ifr Investigation.
Sun-imir.Er up the result of the Invest!- {

court says:

?i?tt-i oi lÂ» iir i rather than rcast t^ef. were
foond to be perfectly svreft with an â  <". r â . f

ties at ccrr.mcn salt have be-ert a<llÂ»<.l as season

Detailing The numerous investigation?
of the keeping quality of the cannc-I
fresh beef, the court concludes that "m
no 'case did the number of sweliet? or
: tainted cans greatly exceed in amount ,
â  one per cent of the entire number â¢ x- i
j ammed." . â  '
Several pasres of the report arf devotee
'to the consideration cf the alie^ati^r.s :
I mide by General Miles that the â â :..- ,

! the threshold of this question "that but :
i little testimony was submitted by him \
'in support of "this contention." The in
ference drtwn by the court from the ab~ |
I se nee of such testimony i< adverse to the 1
; existence of the practice allesed to pre
vail by the Major General Commanding.
Attention i? then call ex. to the fact that
the testimony bf-axing upon the chemical- !
I ization of the beef deals with ft only at ;
i the time of its issuance to the troops. ;
I and analysis of this testimony is made
I with the result of showing "consid- \

'â ' notwithstanding there were other mcdl- â

og res 1 1 lona
Bly at ail of the
First â We recognize that a condition of
war prevails in the Philippine Island? be
tween the Government of the United
States and certain men who are in in
surrection against the lawful authority
of the United States. We believe that
su~h condition of insurrection has arisen
from a course of events which when once
instituted has moved In irresistible se
quence to the present situation â that this
course of events began with the barbari
ties practiced by the Spanish Government
toward the inhabitants of the island of
Cuba. These barbarities were continued
by the Spanish authorities in spite of our
protestations and entreaties through a
series of years for an amelioration of
these dreadful conditions, and finally cul
minated in the destruction of our war
vessel, the Maine, in the harbor of Ha
vana. Every step which followed has
been an inevitable sequence of the pre
ceding events â war â â â â â â¢ the two na
tions, the success of American arms and
the consequences which attach to the
conquest of an armed foe. Among these
consequences were the occupation of the
Philippine Islands by the American naval
and military forces, and the substitution
during the remainder of the war of a sov
eigr.ty of the conqueror for that of the
conquered. In the Philippine Islands,
with the exception of a single year. Span
ish sovereignty has been con.: since
the sixteenth century. The Span
ish Government collected all the taxes.
held the fortifications, appointed all
the civil officers. Span viceroys; Span
ish judges. Spanish courts administered
the laws which were proclaimed by the
Spanish Government and enforced by the
Spanish army ana navy. The sudden de
struction of this sovereignty compelled
the substitution of the sovereignty of
the conqueror. No other government in
the archipelago was competent to re
ceive the authority surrendered by Spain.
Our Government had to accept and as
sume the responsibilities Of the situation
and execute the duties devolved upon it
by the change in the administration of
the laws. The only alternative was to
surrender the islands to anarchy or to
foreign and selfish intervention. Neither
course was compatible with duty or with
the dictates of humanity. Therefore,
aittr the conquest in the harbor of Ma
nila .- was incumbent on our Govern
ment to protect life and property
tnroughout tne archtpeiago. We re-cog
nlz* and declare the facts to be that from
the 13th day of August. I?C<S, until the
4:h day of February, IS*9. peace prevailed
in Manila under the protection of Amer
ican arms; that on the day last named
an insurgent force assailed our army in
Its fortifications and encampnfents under
the cover of darkness, and by this act
of aggression inaugurated hostilities, the
first result of which was intended to be
wholesale massacre and the destruction
of property within the city. We recite
with sorrow the fact that the chief en
couragement extended to the insurgents
has been from some of our misguided
fellow citizens, and to them must be as
cribed much of the bloodshed and ruin
which has followed. We further declare
that the Government of the United
States has sought in every honorable way
to secure cessation of hostilities, as
evinced by the appointment of a com
mission fully ..... with the
insurgents and to offer them peace and
amnesty, and by the action of our miii
taâ.- and naval authorities, who have at
all "times been ready to protect those who
would surrender their arms and cease
their warfare against the Government of
the United States. We point to the fact
that these efforts of peace have been
contumaciously rejected by the insur?
;ren-Â« until it became manifest even to
them that they were waging a hop*
war.
Secondâ We declare cur belief in the
high honor and just action of cur army
and navy in the Philippine Islands. We
believe that our Government has taken
every step that it should take to secure
peace and order. We believe that the ad
ministration representing the Government
has highly ar.q fully discharged its duty
in the premises. Wo consider it our part
to share the burdens of our Government
rather than to embarrass its efforts and
thus prolong the conflict of arms.
Thirdâ We know that at this very hour
our soldiers in arms are face to face with
an armed foe, and until the close of hos
tilities we know only our country, it.<
army and navy and it? executive. We
pledge to them while our flag shall be in
battle our unfaltering support.
Fourthâ a." Americans take pride in
the achievements of our army and navy,
both in the war with Spain and in the
present military operations in the island
of Luzon. The heroism of officers and
men alike has shed renewed luster on.
American arm?. The cause in which
they have fought was and is a just one.
They are now fighting for the security of
the lives? of peaceable -combatants
throughout the archipelago and tn Just
reprisal for an unprovoked attack. We
believe that the sending of seditious ap
peals to the American troops engaged in
hostilities I? an act of treasonable char
acter, and that every appeal to them to
abandon their colors or disregard their

thy with the purpos C tl ";ngs,
: cad.
Hon. William Dudley Foulke of In
diajiapolis denounced the efforts of the
brood of malcontents who would sow
the seed of discord among our people
and paralyze the arm of our executive
in dealing with the insurrection. He
said:
I meet many who are dismayed and !
disheartened at the vast responsibilities j
we are about to undertake for which they |
insist we are so poorly qualified. My plea !
is that these responsibilitie s. which I be- j
lieve we cannot now renounce, shall be â 
undertaken bravely and hopefully. For
myself, I believe that the larger and more
diffcult they are the more "successfully i
will they be met.
I say then that if we are to have co!o- â¢
nies they ought to be large enough, m- !
pcrtant enough and hard enough to man- 1
age to awaken these latent energies. Ha
wall and Porto Rico are now vast enough i
for such a purpose. But the Philippines.
which will open to us a career In the so- I
lution of the complex problems of th^ ;
East, will furnish an adequate object for ;
the genius of American statesmanship.
Let us ignore alike the counsels of en- i
ernies abroad and pessimists at home. Lrt i
us do our duty as the pathway of duty ;
opens before us from day to day. with
the Srm belief that our country, which is Â»
to-day foremost in the opportunities .
which it offers for human happiness, will
stand foremost hereafter in power and
influence and benificence. and will be i
recognized by all men as the peerless j
leader in the civilization of the rid.
Hon. George E. Adams said in part:
The only effect of the Central Music '
Hall meeting last Sunday night was to ;
pive aid and comfort to the enemies of ;
the United States. I do not fear its ef- :
feet upon our troops. What I do fear is j
Its effect on the Tagals. They do not j
understand our people. They cannot un- j
i-stand that the President is only obey
tag the America] people. If such a meet- '
ing can be be] I and go without protest it
prolongs their useless resistance. It ;
causes the loss of lives that otherwise :
might be saved.

Quarter of a Million Taken From the
Morris Park Bookmakers.
NEW YORK, May 7.â Probably the
Morris Park betting ring never experi
enced such a scorching as It received at
the hands of bettors on Saturday. That
six favorites should win was not so much
a. novelty as that the six favorites
were all at good prices. Heretofore when
first choices have swept the card two or
three or more have been at odds on. but
on Saturday the lowest quotation
against a favorite was even money.
A prominent member of the Metropoli
tan Turf Assoc'.ation said that not one
layer belonging to that body had quit the
day a winner, while many of the hun
dred ar.d odd pencilc-rs on the outside,
which includes the field, stopp.d booking
before the fifth race was called. It is
estimated that more than 5230.(>Â» was won
by backers on Saturday. The greatest
loss sustained by one firm was 533,0.Â»> by
a "combination," which includes "Joe"
I'llman. "Max" Blumenthal and Frank
Eckert. Though upward of eighty men
quoted prices in the field and half as
many more on the "dead line." not a
single case of "welching" was reported.

may commend it to the notice of others.
The â "hello" girls get up the picnic, issue

Each also furnishes lunch for two. The

place of rendezvous and back.
Yesterday the destination of the picnic
party was" Laundry Farm in Alameda
County, and bound for there at 10 o'clock
in theme:- thirty couples boarded tha
boat and were born-; out into the stream
in all the glory of their summer finery,
not a whit less fresh from the fact that
they had plugged switches all of the
night before, in their hearts was none
of that jealousy which Slows constantly
between the straight line operators and
the giris who work in the "lumber yards."'
as the worrisome party lines are called
In the vernacular. The superior "straight
liner" forgot her workaday superiority
over the "lumber yarder" and joined in
the general picnicky feeling.
Once at the farm the party danced and
sang and lunched and repeated. At sun
down they woke the echoes with various
songs, including that newest gem "Only
a Chip From Darling's Wooden Leg."
They returned to the city at 7 o'clock, and

they had been bred in hair stores.

THE STREET RAILWAY GRAB.
I 'HE leading article in yesterday's issue of The
Call succinctly presented the principal facts in
relation to the four separate but connected appli
ns made by the Marled Street Railway Compan)
c B Taken together, in their
relation to the i â  ' ' iHwaj
- owned and handled b) that corporation, the>
constitute a scheme for monopolizing the streets anc
excluding opposition that is hardly less than stu-
pendi
For year? it has been a favorite theory of C. P.
Huntington that if all the railroads in the United
-. â  n r er e under one management it would be of
grea i , carried the
â  â¢ ieir ultimate results, merely
substituting himself for the Government as paternal
ism incarnate. The argument? which from time to
time he has put forward in support of his views are
superficially plausible. They may be summed up in
the proposition, which is the fundamental basis of
obnoxi ' ' ' "'ration
lie would be rendered
more econoi ' and more effective than under the
competitive system, and. therefore, that freights and
fares would be reduced to the minimum. The most
obvious flaw in the argument is the corollary or in
ference derived from the assumed premises. The dif
ficulty is that Mr. Huntington himself or his equiva
lent as a factor is left out. Expenses would be re
.!;; ed, possiblj efficiency might be promoted, but the
receipts would not be diminished. On the contrary,
they would be increased. The concentration of trans
portation facilities under a single head and imperial
ism have practically the same foundation.
What the grasping intellect of Mr. Huntington has
ted for the nation he has practiced on a com
paratively small scale in this municipality. The Mar
ket Street Railway Company already holds the greater
part of San Francisco in the grip of a devil fish. A
very fey ted facts will substantiate this asser
tion. Its control of thoroughfares south of Market
street, which from the northeast to the southwest is
the main artery of the city, need not be here detailed.
But it 'no'. ls Market street itself, together with parts
of Jackson and Washingon streets, Clay street. Sac
â¢ Post street. Geary street. Ellis street,
Eddy street, McAllister street. Hayes street. Haight
street. Castro street and Valencia street, over all or
riy all of which thoroughfares, and p"--ibly over
ts running from east to west, the
â  ystem extends. Transversely to the north of
Market street it 1 part of Sansome street.
Montgomery street. Kearny street. Powell street and
other stn w< st as and including Devisadero
street. Tested by the rules of military strategy, this
distribution of power would seem almost if not quite
â¢ to a domii upancy of the most thick
ly settled and valuable residence and business por
â¢ the peninsula.
Now add to these holdings the connecting link on
street, between Geary and Post streets, for
which a franchise has been asked, the virtual posses
sion of Geary street between Grant avenue and Tay
lor street after the present franchise of the Geary
â¢ .ad expire-;, the new projected line on Grant
Geary street to Bush street and down
Bush street to Sansome street, and the whole of
Montgomery and Sansome streets, from Jackson
Mrcet to Market street, and the full measure of the
demands which, during the brief period that will
before the new charter takes effect, the Board
of Supervisors is expected to ratify, will be at least
partly appreciated.
As The Call said yesterday, the imperative wants of
the neglected and v tion of this city inclosed
by Kearny street on the west, by California street on
outh and by the bay on the north and east can
rot be disputed. Nor should any mere prejudice
against i ns and monopolies prevent due
consideration of the proposals of the Market Street
Railway Company. But it is insisted that the Board
of Supervisor- cannot accede to the wholesale scheme
of appropriation that has now been exposed without
recreancy to its trust and utter disregard of the public
v. elfare.
The laws passed by the Legislature in iSq,^ and t00.7,
the latter of which have been necessarily invoked in
the orders and resolutions the gist of which we have
published, were specially designed to insure actual
competition. This purpose is still more vigorously
expressed in the new charter, which has received both
popular and legislative ratification. To anticipate
the new charter and. under the pretense of conformity
with the present statutes, to yield to the dictation of
his arrogant monopoly, which is one of Mr. Hunting
- favorite instrumentalities, would be a fraud on
the people and a disgrace to the board, which might
brinp the Supervisors who permitted themselves to be
used for the attempted legalization of the plot within
I eftalties of the law.
The present Board of Supervisors has been a con
sidciable improvement on the last. It contains gen
tlemen, such a* Supervisor Perrault. who have intelli
gently and manfully lived up to their pledges and re
fused obedience to any improper influence. The com
nuiTtity looks to them to check the wholesale clean-up
designed by the Market Street Railway Company,
which, as it has been actually framed, is not indorsed
by the Merchants' Association or by any other or
ganization of solid, tax-paying citizens. It may be
advisable to postpone final action until after January
i. [000. Under any conditions the application for the
new franchise on Grant avenue and Bush street should
be (ejected, and no permission to use electricity on
Gear street, or in any way to obstruct that thorouph
fare, should be granted. And no opportunity, under
any disguise, to erect telegraph poles or to change
the motive power specified in any of the original
franchises should be furnished without at least having
the validity of that method of precedure sanctioned
by :Uc law department of the. local government

consumers in this city are still called upon to pay
$i 75 a thousand.
It is reported that at the meeting to-day there will
be a proposal submitted to the Board of Supervisors
to compromise with the 1 s^ns company by repealing the
ordinance fixing the rate at Si to and substituting a
raw of $i (*). hi spite of rumors to the contrary, it
is to be hoped no considerable number of the Super
visors will prove so false to the public as to consent
to such a measure. A reduction in the rate from the
old figure to the one proposed would of course be
something Rained for consumers) but under the cir
cumstances it would be virtually a surrender to the
corporation and a wrong to the community.
No adequate reason can be given for fixing gas
roles at $i 6o in San Francisco when it is furnished so
[much more cheaply elsewhere. As a matter ot fact
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 8, 1899.
the only reason why such high rates are to be con
sidered at all is to be found in the precedents of the
past. We have for so long a time borne with the ex
tortion of the gas company that the corporation now
deems itself possessed of an established right to con
tinue such charges.
The history of almost every industry for the last
twenty years has been one of decreasing cost of pro
duction. Labor saving machinery and more scientific
methods of treatment have enabled the producers of
almost all articles to furnish them to consumers at
much lower prices than in times past. Gas compa
nies in the East, whether near coal fields or distant,
have long since reduced their charges in cities where
large amounts are consumed to an average of about
$i a thousand feet, in consequence of the decreased
cost of production, but in this city the corporation
holds on its way and insists upon maintaining the old
price.
The extent to which the gas company carries its dis
regard of the public is shown by the fact that in the
face of an ordinance fixing the rate at $i io it has sent
out its collectors to demand from consumers payment
at the old rale of $1 75. The corporation treats the
law as contemptuously as it treats the people. It
undertakes to dictate to the Supervisors, and has
presumed to instruct them to repeal the present or
dinance and fix rates at the excessive rate of $1 do.
It is under such circumstances the movement has
been begun to form an association of consumers of
gas to make a fight for the rights of the public. The
issue is one which concerns every gns consumer in
the city, and it is to be hoped the association will be
strongly supported. Certain it is that so long as the
consumers will tamely submit to extortion the cor
poration will continue its exactions, and the Super
visors, if they think the people are indifferent, will
not hesitate to make any kind of so-called compro
mise which may be pleasing to the company.
LIFE WITHOUT A STOMACH-
SINCE Juan Patritti of San Mateo ha? proven by
the indisputable evidence of things done that a
man may live without a stomach and yet have
full enjoyment of all the viands served at the banquet
of life, fmm soup to cheese, it may be accepted as a
fret that the stomach is an unnecessary adjunct of the
human system and may be dispensed with without
harm to life, labor or love.
It is true Patritti complains he cannot work as well
as before he lost his stomach; that he now grows
weary after seven hours of plowing. Such a result,
however, is not to be regarded as an evil. The univer
sal wail about over-production is a convincing proof
that people work too much and produce too much.
Anything, therefore, which will limit production with
out limiting consumption is an economic blessing. In
fact, the Patritti experiment is about as important in
ir- bearings on the problems of sociology as on those
of physiology.
The stomach, however, has been always regarded as
a strictly personal matter, having only very indirect
relations to the public, and the issue involved in the
ca->e will be studied by most people with an eye to
its effects upon their private fortunes and welfare
rather than to any change it might briny; about in
Â£reat public concerns with which the economists deal.
It may be noted, then, that the elimination of the
stomach will be as beneficial to the individual as to
the labor market, and will take much of the strain off
the one as well as off the other.
Were there no stomach there could he no stomach
ache, no indigestion, no dyspepsia. There would be
no need for stomach bitters nor for several thousand
other, kinds of medicine. A man would have to buy
no physic except what might be required for liver,
lungs, brain fag and the blood. There would thus be
an immediate relief from the strain upon the system
and upon the purse, and the stomachless man could
many times dance lightly as the lithe-limbed nymphs
of Arcady, while the stomach-bearer was bowed
down with the weight of woe and utterly consumed
with sharp distress.
.Many and various have been the benefits bestowed
upon man by the discoveries of science. We shall
ere long have the option in our journeyings of
traversing the upper air in a flying ship or moving
along the under depths of the mysterious sea in a
submarine boat. We have accomplished the produc
tion of .irtificial silk, and may eventually weave our
j selves garments out of the petals of rose leaves and
lilies. We have carried the sophistication of food to
i such a degree of perfection the time cannot be distant
, when man will live mainly on canned "what-is-it" ami
embalmed air. Let us, therefore, rejoice that science
has provided a way by winch those of us who have
no stomachs for flying ships, submarine trips and
canned goods may get rid of that drawback in our
make-up and go forth unaffected by a stomach of any
kind.
Dr. Albert S. Ashmead has written to the New
York Sun to say the large emigration from Finland
at this time is flue not so much to the suppression of
Finnish liberty as to the fact that the Russian Govern
ment has been enforcing the leprosy law in Finland
with unheard of severity. The matter is worth in
vestigating before we enter upon Mr. Huntington's
scheme of inviting the Finns to California.
So long as the gas company ignores the existing
ordinance fixing rates at $i m and persists in its
course of extorting $i 75 a thousand feet from con
' sumcrs the Supervisors should make no compromise.
A corporation no more than a citizen should be per
| mitted to violate the law with impunity.
When Buckley was in retirement the yellow leaders
of the Democratic factions were bold and loud in de
nouncing him as a boodler and a fugitive from justice,
but now the boss has come back and all their elo
quence on the subject is expressed in a series of daily
Sashes of Examinertorial silence.
Hnntington's promise to begin closing the gap in
the coa c t road at once appears to have a string to it.
Not a very large string perhaps, but one which he
manages to keep so taut that he can play any kind of
tune on it whenever he desires to make the people
along the line dance to his liking.
In an interview Saturday General Merriam ventured
the assertion that, inasmuch as troubles similar to the
strike at Wardner "originated with labor unions, there
should be a law passed making the formation of such
societies a crime." General Merriam has another
guess.
It is full time for the President to start West. He
is reported to be threatened with prostration from
overwork, and California is the place ft him to find
a summertime rest in a climate which is at once sooth
ing, bracing, quieting and stimulating.
So the people who are in office propose to fight the
charter in order to continue in office, and thus we see
it is not always a spirit of self-sacrifice that leads a man
to serve the city. Occasionally one gets into office
and refuses to get out until he is kicked out.
The mangling of another victim by the street rail
way juggernaut will once more raise the fender ques
tion, and perhaps this time it may be possible to keep
standing until the Supervisors compel an answer.

The relative rank of the counties of the
State in point of mineral production la
] given In the following table. In each case
; the value given includes that of all min
eral substances combined produced in the
respective counties for the year. Some
i counties have produced in addition to
1 gold and silver-, live, six or seven other
substances, while other counties which
, yield little or no gold or silver, produce
;in large quantities quicksilver, mineral
, oils, copper, load, asphalt, structural ma
terials, etc. The figure after the names
of the counties indicates aggregate values
of all mineral products for the year, in
cluding the precious metals. The term
! "undistributed" includes total values of
such substances as are grouped to avoid
disclosing private business, as in the
â  ease of single operations in a county. In
the large and complete tables published >
by the State Mining Bureau, from which
these figures are taken, the amount of
I value of each substance in said county Is
j set forth. It is therefore necessary in some
cases to place the figures in the "undis
! tributed" column. The corresponding
production in 1597 Is also given. â

Twenty - Seven Mil
lions Came Forth.
The figures of the mineral production
of California for 1898 have l n finally
compiled for the State Mining Bureau by
its statistician, Charles G. Yale. The rec
ord is the official one that will stand, and
it is the only one. It represents three
months of painstaking effort.
The record displays copper in place of
Becond Importance among the State's
mineral products for the first time. Un
til the Mountain Copper Company began
operations about two years ago copper
had been pretty well clown the list. In
IS:<7 it reached third place, with a product
of 13,6:Â«.fi2f) pounds, worth $1,504,666. Petro
leum that year supplanted quicksilver as
second of rank, with a product of 1,911,
--569 barrels, valued at $1,918,269.
In IS!>S. though the petroleum product
Increased to 2,249,088 barrels, with a valua
tion of $'j.nT<j,42O. copper passed it, with
a product of 21,543,229 pounds, valued at

26.648 flask?, valued at $993,45, to 31,092

saloons and road houses of a shady char- '
acter has apparently gone about as far !
as will be permitted. The murderous
riot at the Thalia saloon has opened the
eyes of the county Supervisors, who will
scrutinize all applications for licenses to I
sell liquors more closely In the future. I
It is not .the desire of orderly people to j
see the county road made a midway
plaisance. and the Supervisors are doing 1
well.âAlameda Argus.
PEANUT POLITICS.
Governor Gage has proven, to our mind,
what we had formed an opinion of him to j
be. At the San Pedro harbor jubilee, if
correctly reported by. the press, he j
snubbed Senator Perkins in that cold, j
self-possessed, matter-of-fact .way that
has no feeling or sympathy in it for any j
one. He held up ex-Senator White on
the pinnacle of tame, and made Senator I
Perkins very small. But such is peanut
politics in this fair Reedley Ex- |
ponent.
GOVtRNOR WAS SPITEFUL.
Governor Gage purposely made sneering j
allusions to Senator Perkins at the San \
Pedro harbor jubilee, and boasted of it [
afterward. Senator Perkins was present j
and made a speech following, but was j
not boorish enough to reply to the Insin
uations or allude to the matter. It is al
leged the Goveronr felt revengeful be-;
cause Perkins was friendly to Grant dur
ing the Senatorial contest. It is a little
out of place for the Chief Executive of
California to indulge in petty slings, but j
he evidently docs not care what he does,
and realizes he cannot be Governor again.
âSan Jose Argus.
HOW NOT TO DO IT.
C. P. Huntington made a speech at a ;
banquet in San Francisco last week, in
which he said that what Caifornia most
needed was more people, and he recom
mended that we encourage the Finns to j
come this way. Telling men the advan- ;
tages to be derived from being in the !
State is quite interesting; to make them
believe all we say Is quite another thing. ;
The natural advantages are not much if
th.> artificial surroundings take the heart
: out of them. If the railroad company !
; would allow producers to make a profit i
i upon the results of their labor for what j
! is raised and made in this State, immi- j
â  f ration would follow too fast for the !
! Southern Pacific to accommodate it. But
i praising climate and prospects and eat
ing up products and profit is not the kind
of work that will fill California with a de- !
sirable class of people.â Petaluma Cour

Lord Charles Beresford told a pood
story In the Hi use of Lords during the
recent del. ate on the navy, lie wanted to
know how long the survey of Wei-Hai-
Wei would take, and if. when the results
of that survey were sent homp to the
Committee on Defense, the works would
nt once be put in hand. Continuing, he
said: "When I was out there the Ger
man admiral made a very curious remark
to me. He said: 'You English are the
most extraordinary people. There are
three ports taken from China. One is
Port Arthur, taken by the Russians; an
other is Kiaochau, taken by the Ger
mans, and the third is Wel-Hai-Wei, tak
en by the British. The Russians are
working with great activity in fortifyinÂ£*Â»
their port: the Germans ;tre employe k
with great industry in making a parade
ground, and the English are employed
with preat industry in making a cricket
ground.'" The House appreciated the
satire and laughed heartily.

rHE ALA-KAN
MISSIONARY WORK
, Key. Sheldon Jackson, D. D United
States General Agent of Education in
Alaska, gave an Interesting discourse on
the land of the Ksklmo last evening
at the Westminster Presbyterian Church.
His subject in the main was a history of
Vl'' 1 , \'V7'^ n Ini Â» si â¢)s Which have
been established in the North and the
work they have accomplished. Rev Dr
nn! I ,,^^ missionary in Alaska from
usfi until 1885, when hp accepted the Gov
ernment commission, nnd since the latter
date has kept in close touch with re
igious progress by making regular year
ly visits. In part he said:
"If a man wishes to witness a model
prayer meeting he should be present at
services conducted in Alaskan churches
The zeal evinced by these hitherto un
civilized people is extremely edffvinir
There are no pauses, waiting for some
elder to arise and lead prayer, or is
thfre a lack of the true religious spirit
which springs from a love d^eilv rooted
in the heart. At times I have seen four
of these natives praying aloud at one
time, each unconscious of the other's
presence. A tranger cannot comprehend
any part of their speech except the word
â¢Jesus â¢ which has been taken from the
English and incorporated in their lan
guage.
"The missionary work has done much
to civilize the land. At points where .1
few years ago it would be dangerous for
even whalers to touch people now move
about with perfect immunity from harm
The first native missionary was Edward
Marsden. Since his ordination many oth
ers have worked in the fields of secular
labor and have greatly assisted in reach-
Ing the parts where we could not go I
find the children much brighter in educa
tional matters than the Indian youth of
California. They are eager to learn and
grasp ideas rapidly.
"The great success of our work can
scarcely be realized, and each year its
fields are broadening and more people
finding the blessings of Christianity. The
Home Presbyterian Mission Board has
liquidated its entire debt and the For
eign Mission Board has reduced its debt
to $40,000."
COURTS TAKEN TO TASK.
In the prelude to his sermon last night
the Rev. W. E. Dugan ot the Stewart
Memorial Church took the courts to task
for releasing the gamblers who were
My caught gambling in the Market
'dens." in part he said:
A raid has been made on the gambling dens '
of Market street and the first case has been
tried In our courts. The court has decided that
gambling with cards for money is as legal an ;
the prearhlns of the goepel; that In the Â«yes of :
thÂ» law It Is Just as right for these dens to
wreck homes and Individuals as it la to kill a !
rut; that thoy have as much right to rob a man ,
as I have to earn a dollar by the sweat of my
brow; that the gambling den reeking with
pollution and all that degrades life Is just as I
legal ns the â choolhouse or the church of God.
In the name of God and humanity, is this so?
If It. I? so in the eyes of the law it Is high time
the law was Â£<Htinir new eyes or the scales
cut from its old ones, or, Etlll better, that
the old corrupt thing be burled forever. When
the law winks at crime it simply has come to
the Ftage where the peopleâ yc-s, and the
churches are taxed to support crime. Would
the people of California submit to a burden- '
some taxation to support panther dens on Mai
ket Btreet, If from these dens panthers were
going out to return with bleeding victims whose
labor was to swell the purse of the den owner?
And s-haii we submit to taxation to support no
less an evil? Not If we rise In holy Indignation
and prÂ« and people stand for right if they
no stand the fiend shall yet be hurled back
The press Is a mighty power In the hand of
God for the rights of the people. The devil
Isn't running our daily press. It Is God's ,
great right arm that Is turning it, and I be
lieve that it will throw out the power that !
works this corruption of our city.
Our dally press stands with its mighty right
hand on the floodgates that will open the foun
tain of heaven's crystal purity, that shall leap
down In pure laws to cleanse our city and
Ktate from the filthy pollution of corrupt laws.
The Judge pays: "Gambling Is Innocent in the
eyes of the law." By the power of eternal right
let us make it a prisoner languishing In a i
dungeon. Let us crush out Its "pure, white and
innocent life."

The naval constructor is on a tour of

The r.aval appropriation of Japan,
made two years ago, was 200,000,000 yen.
or in our money about (100,000,000. This
was for the Improvement of the naval

amount left than the constructor will |

CROMWELL EXTOLLED.
Rev. Dr. Rnder Delivers an Anniver- [
sary Sermon on the Great
Leader.
Rev. William Rader of the Third Con
gregational Church delivered an interest
ing sermon last evening on "Oliver Crom
well, the Hero Kins." At the outset he
said: Cromwell was the hero of the
English commonwealth. The revolution
from which it sprang was a part of a
grand world movement against kings in
the direction of democracy. lie said:
Politically, Cromwell i.- more American than
English. In the days of Charles I there was an
attempt ;f!:i'." by the Royalists to compel the
people of England anil Scotland to accept the
re i of the Episcopacy, which, In the minds
of some was not unlike the Papacy. As well try
to make roses from rock.-=, as to change I'res
byterians Into the Church of England. The
result was the the Covenanters, with a will
likÂ» Iron and a creed as Inflexible as stone
The Royalists and Independents, known a* the
Puritans, began to call names. Because the
Puritans believed in simplicity of dress and
worship, and kept their hair closely cropped; j
they were culled "Roundheads." Because th" i
Royalists were malignant and m"an they were I
i called "Cavalier*." This was all done In the
| name of the Lord. When people begin to call
; ran-.es a battle usually follows. The result was ;
I war. It as precipitated when the King ven
tured to arrest five members of the House of
Commons, for which he was driven from Lon
don to Nottingham, where he set up his stand
ard and waited for a chance to return to Lon
i don. InFtead, he was beheaded in the name
jof religious liberty. The battles of Marston !
Moor and Naseby were victories for Cromwell,
who assumed the trust of government, though
refused the uncertain crown of King. Three
hundred years have not dimmed the splendor of
his name, notwithstanding the difference of
rriinlr.n as to his place In history- lie whs
homely in appearance, rugged in manner, elo
quent in speech, and went from the plow to
Parliament. He firmly believed that God ruled
the politics Of the English revolution. His
"Ironsides" became invincible undet the In
spiration of such a faith.
From Cromwell we have an example of con
science (for he was no better thin his times),
of courageous leadership, of a type of citizen
ship which we could well afford to have to-day
in our own country. He may not have been
all 1 â â :â .< this ape would have him be, but he was
a man of Iron, though the state he founded
went down with him to his grave. and the
English throne rose over his ashes stronger

contest the noise was deafening. Cheer

Father O'Ryan pinned the silver medal
on the young man's breast, and he was
congratulated on all sides for his able
argument on temperance and patriotism.

Color Sergeant George Shaw of Sacred

The exercises opened with, the singing
of the "Yet;; Creator" by the entire au
dience Thomas Fallon, a leader In the
organization, then stated that owing to
Illness Lieutenant Colonel Ryan was un
able to act as chairman, and as that duty
fell on him he outlined the reason for the
gathering, and took occasion to sharply
reprimand the parents and members of
the League C the Cross for thp vacant
seats In the hall. He said there was not
the Interest in the cause of temperance
that the times warranted. He stated
that every seat In the ball should have
been occupied, making it necessary for
the members >>!' the league to stand In
the aisles', aa at previous affairs of its
kind. In concluding, the chairman stated
that the contestant coming oft victorious
would be entitled to compete in August at
the general rally for the Archbishop's
diamond medal He then stated that Rev,
Father James McDonald, Brother George
of the Brothers of -Mary, and Miss Julia
Coffey bad been chosen as judges. The
contestants were then called to the plat
form and wen- roundly cheered ny their
friends and comrades.
Harry Hunt was the first speaker. In
ringing sentences he pictured the folly
of Intemperance and illustrated his
thoughts with examples from ancient his
tory His essay was a trifle high-flown,
but it seemed to strike his list. -tiers just
right, as they applauded his efforts when
he finished.
Color Sergeant George Shaw followed
and spoke along the lines of the preced
ing sp< aker. Sergeant Shaw's delivery
was even and forcible, but the stops he
made injured his i nances with the. judges.
Above the loud cheers that greeted the
conclusion of his essay was heard the
war cry of his company:
"11. , re, re.

George Shaw Is out of sight. "
When the noise had subsided the au
dience arose and sung the national hymn.

Bernard Power and og&in the hall was
filled With the shouts and applause of tiie
gathering. Ynung Power seemed to en-
Joy greater popularity than the previous
speakers, as the reception he received
Was practically an ovation, lie launched
out Into a logical and able argument on
the subject. At the outset he said:
Prevalent among : the majority of the un
thinking people If 1 the mistaken opinion that
patriotism Is Incompatible with a quiet. Indus
trious life and the exact fulfillment of ordin
ary duties. In the minds of most people pa
triotism Is associated with daring deeds, hair
breadth escapes and the killing of tyrants, but
the name has a far : deeper, a far wider and
far more practical ' signification. Whatever
tends to the good of the state, whatever tends
to Improve society, whatever â  tends â¢to better
the condition of his fellow ; countrymen. Is
worth all the attention of the patriot. And let
It be remembered that whatever tends to the
good of the individual tends to the' good of the
state. . - I , . Â«'i , â¢ ' >
He then dwelt on the value of temper
ance and pointed his remarks with some
apt Illustrations. In concluding he said:
Let us not only practice ourselves,' but by
every, means In our. power Induce' others to
practice virtue, which Is the best safeguard
against crime; that virtue Is the surest guar
antee that not one of us will be a disgrace to
his family, to the society In which he moves,
and to that 'nation. whOÃe makers have' be
queathed to us a heritage which It should be
our glory to Increase rather than de.-troy, and
to the preservation of which our highest aspi
rations should ever tend. :<<../" â ,â ;-/>:
Another deafening roar greeted hia
closing sentences ami then the Judges ad
journed to deliberate. Rev. Father Mc-
Donald filled In the gap by delivering a
forcible lecture to' the members present.
He did not mince words, but hit out from
the shoulder, Ho advised the boys to
use the muscle and brain God had given
them to good advantage. He beseeched
them not to He around Idle, but" to go to
work and try and rise In the world. The
reverend father then said sharp things
about the hell-holes on Market street,
and in concluding paid his respects to the
racetrack now running across the bay.
He detailed a series of conversations he
had overheard while returning one even
ing on the Oakland boat on which was
a crowd of loud-voiced race-goers, and
he warned his young listeners to avoid
all such places. His speech was witty and
aroused laughter and was appreciated by
every one, judging by the applause.
Miss Coffey then "made a little speech
as a preliminary to giving the decision
of the committee, and -when she an
nounced that Power was the winner there
wan more noise.
The exercises then closed with the sing
ing of the Te Deum.

THREE STEAMERS
ARE SEEKING THE
ELIHU THOMSON
Rival Will Probably
Bring Her In.
RELEASED FROM QUARANTINE
TBANSPOKTS TO DOCK AT FOL
SOM-STREET TO-DAY.
Steward Maddox of the Onward Near
ly Pois:ned â George W. Stewart
May Lose His Life Through
a Broken Leg.
Three vessels are out hunting for the
broken-down steamer Elihu Thnmson,
and the chances are that not one of the
three will find her, but that Captain
Whitney will bring his vessel in under
sail. The Thomson broke down on April
30 and a' few hours later was spoken by
the transport Senator, to which she
transferred thirteen of the crew. These
in turn were transferred to the Moana
and arrived in San Francisco on the ."th
inst. As sonn as the news "Was made pub
lic the tug Relief was t coaled and provi
sioned and en the morning of the 6th
went out to look for the depelltt.
Saturday the City of Peking arrived
from Honolulu and reported having
spoken the Thomson about 350 miles west
southwest, of the Farallones. ; SHo was
making about three knots an hour 'under
sail. and Captain Whitney refused. a, tow.
but accepted a. couple of bolts of canvas
with which to make sails. As soon as
the Peking's â¢ news . became generally
known the' underwriters, who' have risks
to the extent of $125,000 on vessel and
cargo, chartered the steam schooner
Rival to go out and tow the Thomson
in. . It took all-night to coal and pro
vision the Rival and she did not -get
away unt'/. early yesterday morning.
While the- Riv.'il was being got ready the
owners of- the tug Rescue scented sal
vage and hurried their boat away Sat
urday night. - â â¢â â¢..
The Relief. Rescue and Rival are there
fore on the IdokOul for the Klihu Thom
son, with the chances in. favor of the
latter vessel. The news brought by the
Moana was to the effect that the Thom
son was drifting to leeward" about 'twelve
miles every day. Instead, of that. Cap
tain Whitney, was able to steer a straight
course and make practically no leeway.
The Relief, however, will allow for lee
way and in going -south will probably
miss the prize. The Rescue has. a good
id*?a as ; to ' where -the Thomson is,
but if Captain Whitney refused a
tow from the Peking he is not like
ly to accept one from the Rescue.
Should the Rival find the â  broken-down
steamer the case, will be different. Cap
tain Johnson is the bearer of a letter to
Captain Whitney which instructs him to
accept the. Rival's services. It will thus
be seen that no one. is. going to make sal
vage out of. the Klihu Thomson.
Government wharf (Folsom street) will
be in full swing- to-day.- The transport
Sherman is now on the Hunters Point
drydock, but v.ill come off this morning
and go â  back- to- her old .berth on the
north side of â¢ Folsom street wharf. The
Grant will go alongside the ; hulk at An
gel Island this morning and will be thor
oughly fumigated. During the afternoon
she will be taken to Folsom street -wharf
and docked on i!;. south side. The Cen
tennial will be moved to Main street
wharf In order to make room for the
Grant, and' then 'the work- of loading all
three transports will .be rushed: The
wharf is covered with freight and It will
not take long to get it aboard the
steamers. : . ,
George W. Stewart was taken to the
WftrWir Hospital "yesterday to -have- a
broken leg examined, but as gangrene
had set in. he .was sent out. to the City
and County Hospital, where the leg 'will
probably be amputated. Stewart Is a
miner- from. Salt' Luke â¢ Basin, Calaveras
County. He had made some money and
was proceeding to enjoy himself, when he
cot hurt. He went' to a hotel to get a
bed, but .the place- was crowded- and- a
cot ' was rigged up for him in a stable.
How the tWr.g .happened Stewart cannot
tell, but next morning he was found lying
among the horses- with a - number of
bruises and a broken leg. He .was jolted
in a rough wagon over a rough, road to
Milton, where the* broken leg was set,
after which he was put on the train for
San 'Francisco. â¢ As >ouon -as . the. doctors
at the. Harbor Hospital took the splints
off the limb they saw it was a case that
required more attention than' could be
given on the water front, so they "sent
it out to the City and County Hospital. ,
. H. Maddox. steward of the river steam
er Onward, had B narrow escape for his
life Saturday night. He made a hearty
meal from some canned beef . and shortly
afterward became very sick. Dr. Hopper
was called. In and found the steward suf
fering â  from â¢ ptomaine, poisoning. He
worked over the patient for several hours
before Maddox ' was pronounced 'out of
danger. â â¢â¢'â¢' â â¢â -.. ' â¢
Two gun crews of Ihe Naval, Battalion
were out drilling on the front yesterday
morning. The first crew whs under Kn
sl|:n Burke and the second under Ensign
Cameron, while all were under the com
mand of Lieutenant Hnrlow. . The boys
are working hard and their drill will be
one. of the features of the Native Sons'
entertainment in the Mechanics" Pavilion.
The long looked-for tramp steamer Bel
gian King will probably get here from the
Orient to-morrow morning- She took fif
teen : days to. make the run from Yoko
hama to Honolulu and it should take at
least ten days to cover the distance be
tween Honolulu and San Francisco. ...
The. Hawaiian owners of the 'steamer
Iwa recently fitted that vessel with one
of the Wittram propellers. â¢On the first
attempt she beat her own record between
KahaUa and Honolulu by six hours and
the captain of the boat expects even bet
ter results. The tug Reliance. Is also fitted
with one of these propellers and she has
done better work than ever before since
it was put on. ' .- :

slaughter.

in the eighth that
were enough to dis
courage any ball
player.
During Frisco's
half Sullivan was on
second when Miller
hit a grounder to
O'Neil which Tip
half blocked,
hall went into the.
field nnd Sullivan
ran home, cutting'
off third base by fully thirty feet. If
O'Connell did not see the move he was
the only person In the lot who over
looked It. for even the partisan Frisco au
dience hooted the decision. By the over
light Frisco got one run it was not enti
tled to, although it did not affect the re
sult.
The second cross-eyed decision came
In tho visitors' half of the same Inning.
McGucken opened with a single and
Kleiner bunted to Fltzpatrick In an ef
fort to sacrifice. Fitz fielded Unhappy
out. at second, but Klelbei heat the ball
out by ten feet easy enough, still he was
called out. After that the San Joses
seemed to try to end their misery as soon
as Bible.
Aside from the hitting, which Is always
Interesting, the game abounded In bril
liant plays, Anderson carrying oft the
fielding honors. In both games he played
phenomenal ball, winding up his per
formance with a double play unassisted.

WATSONVILLB, May ".âThe hall I
game here to-day between the Sand j
Crabs and Sugar Boots was the most ex
citing ever played here. It abounded I
in wonderful plays, many accidents
and costly errors in the latter part of the |
game by many of the Sand Crabs, Cap- !
tain Devereaux throughout the latter j
part of the game displayed his kicking i
propensities and demonstrated that he is |
a hard loser. Harper left the box at the |
end of the third Inning, having 1 been hit j
on the wrist. Hayes did some â¢
wonderful base-stealing, but was severe- i
ly Injured in attemnting to steal home. I
The Sugar Beets did not connect severely]
with Balsz' twirling until the last half of i
the game, and then they batted him hard. :
aJldom is Justly elated here to-night
over the successive victories of the h4me I
team. Here Is the score:

SACRAMENTO^ May 7.â The hoodoo is
off. Sacramento turned the tables on
Oakland to-day, giving them the severest
drubbing ever experienced by profes
sionals on the local diamond. Harvey, the
silent boy from the rainless region, â 
pitched his first game of the season for
the locals and was terribly effective at
critical tin-.- Seven scattering hits were â¢
made off his delivery. The bombardment
by the Sacramentos was of the kind j
dreamed about but seldom seen. Score:

DP. HATES, a streets, was crushed in the railroad cars at Fourth Â£
and Townsend streets, was crushed between two oar? yesterday
IS JO morning and sustained injuries which it is believed will prove fatal.
p| ]f 0 Shortly before daybreak yesterday Hayes was sent to Sixth and rT
Townsend streets to "make up" a freight train. After the engine Â« j
had been attached to the train Hayes discovered that one of the &
cars had not been coupled, and he proceeded to attach It to the train. While &
doing so the engineer opened the throttle, and as the train started Hayes #
was caught between the two cars and probably fatally crushed. Notwlth- w
standing his serious injuries the unfortunate man had the presence of mind **
to jump to the outer track, thus saving himself from being knocked down 0
and run over. Aftei getting out of the way of the train Hayes fell uncon- 0
scious on the track, where he was shortly afterward found by Officer Laws
of the Southern station. His right leg was mangled, his hip bone broken and v
his left arm severely bruised. Laws at once summoned the patrol wagon and Â£!â¢
accompanied the injured man to St. Mary's Hospital. Last evening the at- w
tending physician could not' say whether or not Hayes' injuries would prove
fatal. S
Hayes is a married man and lives nt 957 Buchanan street. He has been <*v

A CRACK SHOT
Charley Newman a
Good Marksman.
WINS PRAISE OF VETERANS
EXCELLENT SHOOTING AT THE
SCHUETZEN PARK BUTTS.
Attendance in Some Measure Dimin
ished by the San Francisco Turn
Verein Picnic at Mirabel
Park.
Tn exploring the rather limited field for
accretions to the California Schuetzen
Philo Jacoby recently learned that
Charley Newman of the Richelieu had
expressed a desire to try his hand at
marksmanship, and. extending the "glad
hand" of fellowship, Invited him to make
hi? debut at Schuetzen Park. Newman
consented, and presented himself as a
candidate yesterday. Phllo thought his
charge would do the -wild shooting com
monly resulting from the maiden effort
of a tyro, and in order to encourage him
had all the members coached to praise
hip efforts nnd prophesy that in time he
would mako a good record.
What really occurred was that New
man not only received unbounded praise,
bin by the magnitude of his performance
proved that 1:Â«> deserved it. Tie aston-
I himself as well as the veterans,
and was so pleased that he forthwith lie
came a member of the California Schuet
zen Club. Now the fake prophecy is
transformed into a genuine one that be
fore long Utschig, Strieker, Faktor,
Mason and the rest of the cracks will
have to look to their laurels more dili
gently than in the past.
The event in which the unexpected took
place was the monthly medal shoot of the
California Schuetzen Club, In which two
strings w<T.-- shot off by each member.
Newman scored 104 and SI instead of
having a number of "goose eggs" ap
pended to bis name, and the applause
which followed shook the rafters.
John Utschig carried off the highest
honors with a score of 226-222. D. B. Fak

LOTTIE M WINS
THE BIG STAKE
AT UNION PARK
An Extremely Sensa
tional Course.
EVEN BETTING ON THE EVENT
DAUNTLESS PUTS OUT THREE
PRIME FAVORITES.
Crosspatch Handily Won the First
Prize in the Unfinished Extra
and Van Knapp Took
Second Money.
The large crotvrl that witnessed the
final course of ihe open stake at Union
Coursing Park yesterday afternoon waa
fortunate in seeing one of the most sen
sational, as well as extremely gruelling,
events which has ever taken place in the
history of dr,Â£ racing in this city. Lot
tle M and Young America went to slips
for the first prize. In the betting rinK
both sold at even money. It was a
difficult matter to place cash, as each
of the hounds was considered to be in
equal condition and it would be clearly
an even contest for superiority. The
course lasted several minutes and the de
cision was given to Lottie M on a close
score.
Lottie M led, and the points thus scored
probably won for her the stake. Once
on the field the game was nothing more
than a series of alternate wrenches,
turns and passes by either dog, so much
so that it was difficult for a spectator
to name the score. The dogs worked for
a time Immediately in front of the grand
stand, and the clever performances elic
ited much cheering. At one stage of the
spurt Young America stumbled, but
quickly regained a looting. The little
rabbit endured well, but never got near
the escapes. The course suddenly ended
when Young America made an unex
pected dash and killed. The red flag
went up over I y . 1 1 i < â¢ M and her backers
were happy.
As a rult\ the hares did not run well
yesterday, and most of the courses were
short. Gladiator, however had som<>
hard runs and was finally beaten by Lot
tie M in the sixth round. Dauntless put
up good form and surprised the specta
tors. Lowlander became "unsighted"
with Victor and the latter was given the
flag. Sylvanus also lost sight of the hare
in the next course with xoung Ami
and when the judge refused to giw a de
cision he was hooted by some of the
crowd.
It was a good day for short -r-nders.
Dauntless beat Lord Byron, a 4 to
vorite: dropped Pretender from the card
at 3 to 1, and defeated Snapshot at :â ; to
1. Interesting and Gladiator sold at
money, but the course was Gladiator's all
the way.

"Blavatsky's greal work may be sum
marized as follows: First anil above all
c i sc B he pointed nut to us the greal
p. .so of life. She taught us theosopl
as a religion, philosophy or working hy
pothesis, tan as a living: power in our
lives The keynote of hi r teaching and
of her whole life was Belf -sacrifice/'
ROBBED ON A DOORSTEP.
Hugh Booney's Experience After Be
ing at a Dance at B'nai
B'rith Hall.
Thnmns Coursey, a teamster, was ar
rested early yesterday mnrninp by Po
licemen Galloway and Butler and hooked
at the City Prison on a charge of rob
bery. The complaining witness against
him is Hugh Rooney, Xl Bryant street.
Rooney was at a dance in B"nai B'rith
Hall and took his girl to her home on
Natoma street about 3 o'clock In the
morning. After parting with her he had
that tired feeling and sat on a doorstep.
H. fell asleep and was awakened by
some one tugging at his watch chain. He
struggled to his feet and grabbed hold of
the man, who promptly knocked him
down and ran.
Rooney saw him go into a house and
he notified the two officers, who went to
the house and found Coursey. Rooney
identified him as the man who knocked
him down, but the officers could not Â«et
any trace of Rooney's silver watch and
chain and gold locket. Coursey denied
that he knew anything about them and
said Rooney had made a mistake.

and appropriate and filled the rooms with
sweet-scented fragrance while the last
sad rites were being performed for the
dead. There was no attempt at display,
the wishes of the deceased being strictly
observed in this respect, but while there
was no outward semblance of pomp the
j of deep veneration for the many
virtues and grand qualities of the depart

OVER DESIRELLO
TRIAL I N COLMA
Bitter Feeling Against
the Prisoner.
.L BE RETRIED AT ONCE
at i yes of his victim de-
justice.
g Johnston Wants Her
yer Punished, but
Will Not Take the Law
Her Own Hands.
There !s a very pronounced feeling of
diNappointmeht fn Colma over the result
of the trial of Fred Dcslrello. th*> deputy
constable and deputy sheriff charged with
">% manslaughter In killing your.? Jaims
Johnston in the early part of last month.
Dtstrello has never been popular in Col- |
rr.a, and the shooting of the inoffensive
youth was from the first regarded a? {
â¢wholly inexcusable and savoring of bru- 1
tailty. It is of course possible that Desir- ;
eilo was attempting to stop the horse.;
which he claims he thought was running
away, and one of the bullets from his I
gun accidentally snuffed out the life of j
the boy, but the people of Colma are far j
from satisfied with this explanation. They j
claim that even if the mar. did not com- j
iriit deliberate murder he exhibited, a j
recklessness and Indifference to cense-;
quences of discharging his revolver at a
wagon containing three boys that marked
him us an unsafe man to be at large.
The failure of the jury to agree upon a
verdict is not final; and it is the intention
of District Attorney Bulloch to have the
case retried at the earliest? opportunity:
It is admitted by ail that the District At
torney prosecuted the case with vigor and
ability. His action has beon in marked
â¢contrast to the conduct of certain other
county ofliclals who have been connected
with the case.
Mrs. Cyril Gugllelmcnl, the eldest sis
ter of Desirel] o r s victim. Is very bitter
over the outcome of the trial. She feels
that there is but little hope of the final
conviction of her brother's slayer, be
cause of the political connections of the
man charged with the crime. Neverthe
less she ha? perfect confidence in the
honesty and ability of the District At
torney* and hopes against hope that the
second trial will result in conviction.
"We do not ask that Desirello shall
be hanged for killing my brother," said
1 Mrs. Guglielrnoni yesterday, "but we do
* think he ousrht to be punished. I do not
understand how a jury of average intel
ligence could fail to agree on a verdict
or manslaughter after hearing the evi
dence produced at the trial."
Mrs. Guglielmoni wished the state
ment denied that she or any member of
her family had any intention of wreak
ing vengeance on Desirello in case he was
llnally a< Quitted of the charge against
â¢',\\*e felt very ...... time of the
shooting, as was but natural." she said,
"and we can hardly be expected to think
of him without bitterness now, but we
have no intention of taking the law in
our own hands: We are satisfied to let
the law take its course, and if Desirello
1? finally given his freedom we cannot I
prevent it. Still I do not think he will j
care to loaf around Colma as much as
"They say the Jury was influenced by
considerations for Desirello's wife and
ag< I lather, both of whom were with him
i.-. the trial. I am also sorry for them,
especially the father, but I think we are
entitled to some consideration as well.
and I think the man who killed my
brother should be punished."
WITH THE NOBLE
RED CROSS WORKERS
â¦
INTERESTING ITEMS GLEANED j
AT HEADQUARTERS.
V Renewed Activity Among the Mem- !
bers Due to Fighting and Sick
ness at Manila.
â¦
The Red Cross Hospital in Manila is to
be reopened Immediately, as the want of
it will be greater during the months of
rainy weather than at any previous
time. General Bennett, representing the
National Red Cross Society, with head
quarters at Washington; D. C, left for
Manila, last week. He has hopes of ar
riving in advance of the large quantity
of supplies which were sent by way of i
Suez. Besides hospital' supplies of every
kind, are 20,000 equipped cots which fold
Into a conveniently smail space.
The hospital will for the present ba
housed in tents raised on wooden plat
forms and stockaded. The General, who
has had two years' experience in Philip
pine climate, believes this will ba more
hygienic during the rainy season.
Mis. Whitelaw Reid has had the selec
tion of the nurses. She Is an active I
worker in the national society and has
exercised great care in selecting suitable j
nurses. She has been much interested in i
getting a bill through Congress making
women nurses a part of tho regular I
army. Under the bill the nurses wore to j
enlist and be under military direction, i
The bill failed because of the inability to I
get a quorum when it came up. but Mrs. j
Reid is confident It will be passed at the i
next session, as the army men ire all ,
In favor of it. V :
Major Owens, who has just returned
from Manila, and while there was in
command of the hospital at C'orregidor, |
is in favor of women nurses in the "mill- j
tary hospitals, but he does not want !
them at the front nor where they will
require guards or extra accommodations. |
He speaks highly of the aid he received
from the California R.ed Cross in Ma- j
At.ila. and says his men would have fared
*^..uch worse without their supplies and I .
* There will b*Â» plenty of work for tne
State Red Cross Society at home when !
afTalrs have been wound up in Manila i
The men who come back many of th"m j
r.oed more care than thf-y did' when ill,
but were housed and fed by the Govern- >
mer.t. Many of thorn are shattered in I
body and are nervous wrecks. While
they will obtain pensions in tlmÂ«. it may j
r.ot bo for months and even for years. |
In the meantime many are far from i
home, without money to get to places
where they could be cared for by loving
friends: The laui^s of the State IW i
Cross ar*Â» doing all that can* be done for j
them and have furnished transportation
to about 2K> men already, with clothing j
and comforts for the journey.
The California Red Cross Society, while â 
it does not control the affairs In Manila. !
will continue to n!d in ever:.- way it can.
Dr. Belle Reynolds has gone there as a j
representative. Dr. Reynolds me to .

Dr Mackenzie took for his subject.
"The Younz Men of '0 and '99." He
spoke in glowing terms of praise of the
steadfast Christian spirit and energy
shown by the founders of the church In
this city under adverse circumstances and
cited them as worthy examples for the
v'oung men of to-day to emulate. He said
they came to this city when everything
was in an unsettled condition, when they
expected to be here but a short time, yet
while fever to get rich was at its height
they did not forget their Christian train
ing" but determined to organize a church,
which was at once done. The first wooden
elvirch in which they worshiped was
brought around the Horn in sections and
erected on Stockton street in 1550, after
they had been holding services in a can
vas" tent for a year.
VÂ£ In ' commenting on the devotion to the
worship of God in the early days. Dr.
Mackenzie took occasion to say ttiat peo
nle in" the East were accustomed to talk
of California even at this time, as a god
, country. He had found however,
that the moral shortcomings of the peo
ple of' this State were uy far more gen
c-al among W^.ose who had come mi the

EARTHQUAKES HIS THEME.
Rev. E. A. Woods Delivers an Inter- ,
esting Sermon on Temblors and
Their Dire Effects.
Rev. E. A. Woods of the First Baptist
Church, delivered a sermon on "An Earth- i
quake and What Came of It," last night, j
in the course of which he enlightened his j
listeners on the earthquakes of past cen- j
tur!e3. their causes and effects. He said \
in part:
Earthquakes have been common in all ages. j
both a:icier.t and modern Ir. A. O. 63 the clt- |
lee cf lierculaneum and Pcmreil were de- t
stroyeJ by an earthquake, and the historian I
Gibbon â¢ays that 2SC,<XG people perished. In i
1756 there was an earthquake at Lisbon, Por- [
tugal. In which 60,000 people perished. It Is \
estimated that in the hSstcry cf the human j
race as many as 13,000, CC0 of people have thus ]
perished. In our own times, an-l within thi [
United State*, earthquakes ere nnt uncommon, f
but the res-Jits have not beer, disastrous.
In ancient times art quakes were Fupnosed '
to be the result of 6ur*rnatural agencies, but !
scientific investigation has disproved this. The
earthquake BDoken of in the text may have
been the result of natural causes; we cannot
affirm or deny.
Paul and Silas were preaching In Phllippt, j

and a certain woman "possessed with a spirit
of divination." who brought her masters, made !
gain by fortune-telling under the inspiration '
of an evil spirit, was delivered from this evil j
possession by Paul. She was no longer a
source of revenue; hence Paul and Silas were I
arrested, beaten and chained in a dungeon. In !
this cn.*e the creed for gain Inspired a cruel
persecution. i n our day much of the evil and
wickedness In society are caused by the love of I
money. Intemperance, gambling and dens or !
infamy have as their cause this creed ' -
money. Christianity would remove those evils, :
and, because, it Is hated by those whose hopÂ«
of sain is thus taken away.
Paul and Silas, scourged and thus Imprisoned,
prayed and sang praises unto God. They knew |
he na4 not forsaken them. And the other pris- ;
oners were listeningâ and the world is always .
listening when Christian* Buffer. To bear af- !
fllctions and not only pray, but sing-none but '
the Christian Inspired by faith In God can do I
this.
But the Jailer, awakened by the quaking of :
the earth, sees the prison doors wide open, and '
supposing the prisoners have escaped and I
knowing that If they are gone he must die. !
wae ab , nut to kill himself. But Paul cries out. I
Do thyself no harm, for we are all here." )
Then the Jailer knew that these men were
<3od s representatives at that he himself was
a sinner bet re God. "What must I do to be j
saved were his first words as he ?Â»!! down be
fore the apostles. They preached the gospel of .
salvation to him. He believed in Christ, an!
at onoe made Us public confession of Christ

It was dc
v.th adjei tl
"shocking:' 1 to "awfully bad taste," but
that was all there was to it. No one made
any objection to her presence and no one
audibly objected when she boldly cast her
ballot and thereby oast a stain over the
election that the teachers are now trying
to wipe out. When Mr?. Craven was
dropped from the department, not by dis
missal, but by a forced resignation, there
were a great' many teachers who consid
ered it was time to drop Mrs. Craven
from the other privileges which teachers
in good standing are entitled to. There
were quite a number, however, who be
lieved Mrs. Craven was really the wife
of Fair, and these friends are now the ac
tive element in the faction of the annuity
association that is willing to have Mr.-.
Craven figure among- those who have been
honorably retired from the department.
There are none who are anxious for her
to be put on the roll. The old commit
was approached on the subject, but there
was opposition enough to make it seem
a hopeless case, and then it became noised
abroad that Mrs. Craven would try to
have elected a committee that would be
willintr to bite at the glitterinlg bait she
was offering and lend the respectability of
the teachers to bolster up her tight for
the portion of a doubtful widow. There
was no active fight and the committee as
elected is no more apt to accede to her
request than was the old one. .... ac
tive opponents of the scheme on the old
committee were placed on the new one.
But Mrs. Craven was present and she
voted, and outside of the parliamentary
tangle which it has caused the unanimous
opinion is expressed that whatever else
it was it was an exhibition of assurance
hard to equal.
MILITARY MUSIC IN CHURCH.
The Famous Twenty-Fourth "United
States Infantry Musicians to Play
at an Entertainment.
The Twenty-fourth Infantry band, un
der the direction of Professor Wilfred O.
Thompson, will render an interesting pro- I
gramme of marches, operatic and class;- j
cal selections, to-night, at the "Cobweb" |
entertainment in Bethel Church, on Pow
ell street, near Jackson. The affair is
giver, for the bentflt of the "grand rally,"
and its manager. Miss Rose Alexander, is !
confident that it will prove a financial J
success.
Following is the programme prepared
for the occasion:

Sunset District Affairs.
The Sunset District Improvement Club !
at its last meeting passed a resolution I
calling the attention of the Supervisors j
to the choked condition of the H street !
sower. This sewer was constructed last j
year at tho urgent request of the rest- j
dents of the valley at an expense of
$15,000. After the long wait of the peo
ple for a drainage outlet the sewer was j
run through the principal section of the j
valley. But, like the majority of munic- i
ipal jobs, it was a failure, as it ran into j
a sand heap at its western terminus, i
This has left it without an outlet and as I
a result it has become choked and is j
practically useless as a sewer, and even j
worse; it" backs up its offensive matter j
and flows Into tho side sewers from the
numerous dwellings. The effect of this
was that property owners were com- I
pelled for sanitary purposes to sink cess- ;
pools in their yards.
The customary set of resolutions de- ;
nouncing gambling and adding stiffening
material to the backs of the Police Com
missioners in refusing licenses to the of
fenders were passed.

In telling the story of the assault the
girl said: "I was walking along King

er caueht me by the throat and almost
strangled mo. I struggled to free myself
from his grasp, when he tightened his
crip on my throat, and 1 swooned away.
When I recovered my senses I was lying
in a stable bruised and bleeding. A citi
zen who had evidently been attracted to
the place by my screams for help, picked
me up and" assisted me to my horn'?."
The unfortunate girl shows unmistak
able traces of the assault committed on
her by Anglassey. Her throat is badly
scratched and swollen and her face cut In
several places. It is likely that an ad
ditional charge of an assault will be
placed against the prisoner to-day.

query '.'What shall it profit a man it ha
shall gain the whole world and lose his
own soul? Of what shall a man give In
exchange for his soul?" ...
This, extract from Holy Writ is print
ed on large sheets of white paper, and
nothing of the kind has ever appeared in
the local trains before. It Is not consid
ered likely that any religious devotee
would pay for the space these placards
occupy, so the inference has been reached
that Mr. Huntington, in accordance with
his known desires for the amelioration of
humanity, has caused the strange signs
to appear. Well, Mr. Huntington uaa
about as much of this world as any single
individual and should be able to answer
the question.
Some remarkable things are done in
Oakland courts. But one of the most re
markable was the progress from an ar
rest on a charge of murder to the ais
inissal of Con Townsend last week. On
the Sunday afternoon when ' Cann was
murdered M half a dozen men were arrest
ed and the police were certain they had
.1 good case of manslaughter at least
against Townsend: At the inquest a
woman testified to acts on the part of
Townsend that were certainly suggestive.
When the case came to trial Judge Smith
had been informed that two Important
Witnesses would testify to certain acts on
the part, of the accused, yet when they
were placed under oath one of them said
lie had never seen Townsend before in
his life, and the other's story was no
more useful to the prosecution. In truth,
the evidence in the Police Court tended
to show that McCann practically com
mitted suicide, and had another week
elapsed before the examination it is im
possible to guess at what might have
been proven. At present Townsend ap
pears to be a lucky man. but McCann a
luckier one, for had he not died he would
probably now have been on trial for an
assault to murder.

NARROW-GAUGE TRACKS
VANISH IN THE "SINK"
ALL TRAVEL OVER THE LINE
DELAYED HALF A DAY.
Many Sidetracked Excursionists Be
come Angry and Take Satisfac
tion by an Attempt to De
molish the Cars.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, May 7.
The roadbed of the narrow-gauge line
over the "'sink holt ." about a mile south
of High-street bridge, sank out of
Bight again this morning, and not only
created considerabli 111 humor among the
railroad officials, but tried the patience
of a train load of picnickers bound for
Sunset Park, in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains.
Since the accident about a week ago
the railroad company lias stationed a
night watchman at the sink hole to warn
the early morning trains in case thr> road-
Indlcationa of KoinK out of
sight. When the watchman reported oft
duty at 7:15 this morning the track was
apparently solid. The regular track
walker went over the line about fifteen
minutes later and found that about ninety
feet of the roadbed had sunk down Into
the mud and ooze, leaving the rails and
ties hanging in space like a suspension
bridge. The great quantity of rock and
gravel dumped at the placo since the last
Binking had sunk eight feet below the
grade of the roadbed.
The train from Santa Cruz was flapped
in time to prevent a disaster. The Kan
train leaving Park-street station at
went as far as \)\o sink, where the
passengers wore transferred. The regu
lar Ha nt a <"ruz train was hunp up at
High street until 1 o'clock this afternoon,
along with a big train load of excursion
ists bound for Sunset I'ark. The picnick
ers were composed of the members and
friends of the South find and Dolphin
boat clubs of San Francisco.
The railroad company was notified of
tli> accident in ample time to arrange to
convey the excursionists over the broad
gauge line, but instead a train was run
to within a mile of the sink, where it
was Bidetracked pending temporary re
pairs to the roadbed until late this after
noon, when it pr eded t" it;- destina
tion. It was Punnet Park in reality when
the picnickers arrived there.
During the delay the excursionists be
cami so exasperated that Borne of them
lost their tempers and threatened to take
satisfaction out of the railroad company
by demolishing the cars. Several win
dows were broken and Home slight dam
age done before cooler counsel prevailed
and the angry ones were calmed down.
As soon as the accident was reported
a wrecking train and a crew ol ;li;y
men were dispati bed to the place. A
temporary trestle work of heavy timbers
and ties was constructed which managed
to support the tracks until the afternoon
trains passed over, when It began to sink
again in places.
The sink hole has puzzled the railroad
officials ever since the narrow gauge line
â was built. Hundreds of tons of rock and
gravel have been dumped at the place,
only to sink out of sight in the course of
it few weeks. Long piles have been driv
en down in an attempt to secure a solid
foundation, but hardpan has never been
reached and the piles have sunk nut of
Bight of their own weight. There was an
unusually high tide last night that e.,v
ered the marsh land in the vicinity of
the sink. The railroad people claim that
the roadbed became saturated, causing It
to melt like sugar.
THE SASI FBAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MAY 8, 1899.
REV. DR. COYLE
DEFIES EDWARD
EVERETT HALE
Denies the Great Di
vine's Allegations,
DEFENDS PRESBYTERIANISM
SAYS IT IS NOT THE FOE OF
LIBERTY.
Some Sharp Criticism of the Attitude
of Unitarians With Crisp
Facts About Scotch.
Presbyterians.
OAKLAND, May 7.â Rev. Dr. Edward
Everett Dale's view of the Presbyterian
church, as exploited in a dispatch from
New York printed in to-days Call, where
in !u- looked upon that church as liberty's
greatest foe in this country, declaring
that in its organization and doctrines th,.
eminent exponent of Unitarianlsm finds
a menace to free institutions, has called
forth a pointed and almost bitter reply
from Rev. Dr. R. F. Coyle of the First
Presbyterian Church.
Rev. Mr. Coyle's talk was on home
missions, and In making an appeal for
collections for a mission he said that he
trusted he should not be charged with
sectarianism If he appealed to his congre
gation's Presbyterianism.
"Our Unitarian friends are everlast
ingly talking about Unitarianlsm," con
tinued l>r. Coyle. "They call themselves
broad; when we do it. they call it nar
row, if I should stand in my pulpit
Sunday after Sunday talking about Pres
byteriai Ism l would justly be called nar
row and sectarian. So would l>r. Dllle if
he talked nothing but Methodism; or Dr.
Brown, it he talked only Congregation
alism."
"The statement of Everett Hale is un- '
worthy of the man." said Dr. Coyle to a
Call reporter alter this evening's serv-
"There is nothing whatever in his state
ment. It is not true, our church gov
ernment is entirely republican; it is rep
tative. Our congregations elect their
ministers and church officers. Or. Hale
says there is no back door, and that we
ministers are elected for life. Our church
government, I reply, provides for the
election of elders for a term nf three
years, and also provides for the demitting
of the ministry. A man ran leave a min
isterial office and he no longer ordained
and he simply a layman. Just recently
we elected our church officers for a term
11 f three ye.
'l>r. Hale's statement that the presby
tery is the foe of liberty Is absurd and
false and unworthy any Intelligent man.
As a matter of fact, the nrst deliverance
on the subject of liberty In the days <>f
tli t ' colonies was made by the Presbyte
rians in Virginia. It antedated the Dec
laration of Ii c. It is esti
mated by historians that 900,000 iÂ»>i>ula
tion of the colonies at the tim>' <>f the
Declaration of Independence were Scorch
and Scotch-Irish Presbyterians. Further
more, there is no ecclesiastical control
In "iir church. 1 suppose by this term
Hale means we put the clamps on. hut
that is not true, and our members don't
know anything about it. We invite Uni
tarians, Universalists, men and women
"f a!l denominations and no denomina
tion, to come to nur communion serv
ice, and we ask no subscription of our
mcml â  rs.
"Suppose T should state in the pulpit
that the Unitarians do not believe what
they preach a statement made o-f us by
the Unitarian minister of Oaklandâ what
would they say? And suppose I should
as he did, upbraid tlu- Episcopalians and
Catholics for observii is they do?
Would the Unitarians call that broad?
If r wasn't going away ! would answer
:â  more fulfy."
l>r. Coyle leaves next Friday to attend
the Presbyterian General Assembly,
which opens in Minneapolis on May is.
H<' is a candidate for the offl f mod
r of th< assembly, and Advices from
the various districts â¢â  â¢ iraq-
Ing in his favor. After the general as
sembly Rev. Mr. Coyle will go to New
York, and on June :', he will sail for Great
Britain and Continetal Europe, visiting
Holland, Austria. Italy, Switzerland and
France.
BROKE HIS FATHER'S NOSE.
Sequel of Capitalist Armstrong's Suii
Against His Wife to Recover
Real Estate.
OAKLAND, May 7.â The injuries sus
tained by Thomas C. Armstrong, the aK'd
Haywards capitalist, a few days ago at
the hands of his pun, Samuel P. Arm
strong, turn out to be worse than at
first expected. The father's nose la frac
tured. The trouble Is one of the sequels of
the Bull recently brought by Thomas C.
Armstrong against his wife for the re
covery of valuable real estate which the
husband deeded away at a moment when
he believed death was very near. In
Armstrong's complaint he alleges num
erous acts of cruelty on the part of his
children. Regarding the attack of a few
days ago the elder Armstrong said to
day:
"When I went into my bouse a few days
ago to get something to eat I dropped
Into the dining room and put a book Into
a drawer. Then I went to a closet to get :
Bom< papers out of my valise when my
son. Sammy, seeing me, ordered me out of
the house, at the same time calling me a
vile name reflecting upon my birth, tell
ing me i didn't own anything In the place
and then striking me upon the nose with
his 'Navy Armstrong gun,' fraeturlng ray
nose. 1 would have had him arrested,
but I do not want the disgrace, and the
language he used to me was the first he
had spoken to me since March 4, when I
filed the suit against my wife to recover
property the deeds to which she wrong
fully had recorded."
The suit in question when it comes to
trial will prove a decidedly sensational
one. The Armstrongs are one of the
wealthiest families at Haywards, where
the husband and father Is engaged in the
real estate business.

the sad tidings to the bereaved mother

last night, tmt had little to add to the
account of the disaster given by Mr.
Hadenfeldt.

PLANNING A CAMPAIGN
A Double Public Benefit to Be Won
by Extending the Panhandle.
Seeking Ways and Means to Maintain a Systematic
Advocacy of the Wisdom of the Proposed
Bonding of the City.
THE advocacy of the extension of
the Panhandle of Golden Gate
Park tn Van Ness avenue is re
ceivlng with each day a more
general popular approval. Many
of the leaders of some of the local im
provement clubs have already begun to
discuss some systematic campaign to
demonstrate - j the voters of the city
the wisdom of permitting the proposed
extension under municipal authority.
These champions of the change, which
â¢will give to San Francisco one of the
greatest. If not The greatest, park in the
world, are alive to the fact that popular
enthusiasm must be sustained. They
are confident of the support of practi
cally every influential element i- the
comrrunity, "merchants andMtiefchanlcs,
men who will reap an immediate as
well as a permanent benefit from Un
protected Improvement.
An argument is well made that San
Francisco will enjoy at least three
years of unexampled prosperity if the
panhandle is extended. When the Mid
winter Fair was projected citizens of
all classes worked in harmony and with
energy to make the projected exposition
a success. It was shown that business
menÂ«and workingmen would be sharers
in a benefit common to both. Thou
sands of men found employment in the
building of the fair. An enormous
amount of money was set legitimately
in circulation. Prosperity dispelled the
well-founded fear of a spell of depres
sion.
The people p' '-c < â 'â¢-- had won for
themselves something that would not
have come without agitation and per
sistent encouragement. The building
of the Midwinter Fair is taken there
fore as an example by the leaders of
the improvement clubs. They propose
to work now for a permanent improve
ment to the city and win at the same
time for its people a greater immediate
reward than was secured through the
Midwinter Fair.
The only lasting benefit derived from
tin- Midwinter Fair was the reclama
tion of a comparatively small part of
<;.>l<len Gate Park. The extension of
the panhandle will give to the city a
new and great park extending into the
very heart of the city giving to thou
sands of men, women and children op
portunity t'"i- daily health seeking and
recreation and remaining, as long as
the city remains, to be an adornment, a
practical bene*" and a pride to the
State as well as San Francisco.

â¢* â *^' *â¢ .Gathered on the. spacious balcony and in the yard at the rear â¦*
gg of the building were the most prominent Hebrews of the city, and for half 55
<â Â« an hour they listened- to the eloquent speeches- of President Haas and Rab- 0 .
% 9 bis' Voorsanger, Nieto, Myers and Levy. After the ceremony every one was *Â°
** invited to inspect the building. â¢*
i* Kabbi yoorsanger, who was introduced by President Haas, spoke feelingly S3
25 of the hospital and' the difficulties that had to be surmounted before it ;jg
cÂ» could be erected. He touched but lightly upon the opposition that has al- no
* # ways been manifested by a portion of the . Jewish community against the f 3
â¢Â° project, and said that 'that matter was now beyond the need of argument. â¢*
28 The hospital was finished and its success would .be the best proof of the *S
.5 necessity for it. . Â»5
j.;'...' The -hospital is a handsome two-story building of thirty rooms, with oÂ«
" ample room for fifty patients. It is modern in every respect and fitted with *.
*Â° every appliance necessary to the treatment of the sick. It has been six *Â°
â¢5 months in building and has cost the Mount Zion Hospital Association over SS
J5 $40,000. It was erected under the supervision and direction of E.Raas, chair- S3
cj man of the committee. Although it was built by the Jewish people of ' this c ,
cÂ» city, it is non-sectarian and purely a charitable Institution. *
'â > .. Dr. Julius ; Rosenstirn will :be the surgeon in charge and Dr. C. G. Leyi- â¢*

The advocates <>f the proposed ex
tension insist, with reason, that the
work of transforming a little city into
a great park will give work for years
i" thousands of artisans, will give a
healthy Impulse t<> trade and legiti
mate profit to tradesmen, and will in
vite Investors, settlers and desirable
people to the city. Through the
elimination of a large residence dis
trict in the city other districts will of
necessity b 1 improved and settled.
The outside districts will be the only
practical sharers oT this benefit, as
they will have to be sought when there
is not room anywhere else.
The outside districts will therefore
derive a double benefit from the bond
ing of the city. ITnder1 T nder the proposed
new law, by which the municipality
will be bonded, generous provision will
be made for public utilities and im
provements in the outside districts.
New and costly buildings will be
erected, and general attention will be
drawn to the fortunate districts.
There will be in consequence ah added
reason why property owners in the
panhandle extension district will wish
to settle in the outside districts.
These are some of the reasons why
the leaders of the Improvement clubs
arej planning a systematic campaign in
advocacy of the proposed bonding of
tin- city. These men are peculiarly
fitted to understand and obey the wis
dom of providing for the future wel
fare of the city. They are practical
pioneers in the districts in which they
reside. They bought their homes and
settled their families in the outside
districts, with an absolute faith that
the" city, In the natural course of
events, must expand. They can see,
therefore, that sooner or later the pan
handle of Golden Gate Park will be
extended. The panhandle as it exists
now and New Montgomery street are
two standing examples of official mis
takes, made in an endeavor to com
promise what ought to be done with
what conditions insist must be done.
The original purpose of the creators
of Golden Gate Park was to construct
the panhandle even farther than Van
Ness avenue into the heart of the city.
The erection of the City Hall pre
v.-ms the realization of the original
design in its completeness, but either
new or later the panhandle of Golden
Gate Park will begin at Van Ness ave
nue. It will be cheaper to do the work
now than later.
