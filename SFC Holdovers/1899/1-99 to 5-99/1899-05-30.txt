VOLUME LXXXV-KO. 181.
CORRUPT SUPERVISORS FAIL TO ENFORCE
THE DEMANDS OF THEIR RAILROAD MASTERS
Market Street Company Franchises Fail
to Be Passed to Print After a
Stubbornly Fought Battle.
THE people of San Francisco have fought and won one of the most
signal victories ever achieved in the history of the municipality.
It remains with Mayor Phelan to determine whether or not this
triumph, which involves millions of dollars and freedom from the
exactions of a dominating monopoly, shall be made permanent. The
Southern Pacific Company and its ally and feeder, the Market Street
Company, have failed to secure from the Board of Supervisors the enor
mously valuable franchise privileges which in defiance of public opinion
and honest protest were demanded.
These franchises need but little characterization. Their character,
since their recent announcement, is notorious. Their adoption would have
meant the robbery of the city, immeasurable injury to property .own
ers, the cheating of the charter and a fifty years' triumph to the associ
ated corporations. An adoption of these franchises would have meant the
violation of public and private rights, the usurpation of hundreds of
streets by an exclusive monopoly and the death of competition for half
a century.
Yet the Southern Pacific Company and the Market Street Company
bought, by whatever means they care to suggest, the indorsement of the
Street Committee for these outrageous schemes. The franchises were to be
passed to print yesterday at a meeting of the entire Boarcl of Supervisors.
Seven serviceable members had been secured. They defied in sullenness
nnd shame the protests of the people. They were determined to win the
reward of their service and not even the scathing denunciation of their
honest associates could swerve them from +heir path of shameful duty.
They were reinforced by a gallery of hissing loafers and attorneys
of the railroad. They tried every possible artifice to carry out their part
of the bargain and receive its price. But they failed. The franchises
were not passed to print and remain as they were before, simply a re
commendation of the Street Committee. As a sop to outraged public
opinion the proposition to grant the Southern Pacific Company the privi
lege of operating double tracks in the Mission was withdrawn.
The battle then commenced on the street railroad franchises and
waged for nearly four hours. Mayor Phelan and the minority, inspired
by a purpose to honor a decent public policy, fought the adoption of the
franchises in every way within the laws of a legislative assembly and
after a bitter struggle the fight was won.
The board adjourned without day ajad without passing the atrocious
resolutions to print. In adjourning without fixing a time for the next
meeting the corrupt majority of the board placed in the hands of Mayor
Phelan a weapon which will win the battle for the people of the city. While
it is customary for the Board of Supervisors to meet every Monday,
there is nothing in the law to make such meetings compulsory.
The Southern Pacific Company and the Market Street Company
must obtain the coveted franchises before July 1 or any grant which the
Supervisors may make will be, under a provision of the charter, null and
void. Mayor Phelan, unaer the law. need not call another meeting of the
Board of Supervisors until July 1. The Mayor is thus master of the situ
ation with a power for good that seldom comes to a single man. He can
by refusing to call a meeting of the Board, and no legal meeting can be
called without his sanction, defeat what is perhaps the most gigantic
steal ever attempted in the history of the city. Those that followed his
energetic protection of the rights of the people yesterday feel that, al
though some nominal hardship might follow his refusal to call a meeting
he recognizes that in the tremendous balance of public g-ood and corpor
ate greed he will tip the balance as he did yesterday and merit the com
mendation of the city.
The law under which Mayor Phelan has power to act is section 67
of the consolidation act, as follows: .
Sec. 67. The Supervisors shall meet within five days after each an
nual election, and also on the first Monday of January, April, July and
October, of each year, and at such other times as specially required by
law; or they may, for urgent reasons, be specially convoked by the presi
dent of the Board of Supervisors.
LONG before the Board of Super
visors met for it* afternoon ses
sion there was an atmosphere of
agitation in the City Hall. Thou
sands know that the meeting was
to be one of the most important ever
held in the history of the municipality.
Franchises worth millions of dollars
were to be sold corruptly to the South
ern Pacific Company and its local
feeder, the Market Street Company, or
were to be preserved to the people of
the city. The issue was one of gigantic
moment and the corridors of the City
Hall were crowded by men Inspired by
eagerness to hear the Issue determined.
It was known that seven Supervisors
had banded together, to sell their per
sonal honor and betray the city to the
corporation which has bc-ught reputa
tions and sold cities for its own finan
cial advantage. These seven Super
visors had been branded by the Iron of
public scorn. They had been threatened
by indignant citizens with personal
violem-e after j>lÂ«-ading and importuni
ties had proved to be in vain. Men rep
tlng the cohservatlve business in
terests of the city had vehemently con
demned the prospective action of the
majority of the board and had promised
to appear in person at the session to
protest against the contemplated out
rage.
There was in consequence a gTeat
deal' of excitement in the City Hall.
Th" police authorities, anticipating ,
trouble, were prepared, and squads of
officers were stationed at the various
entrances to the board rooms and to
the Supervisorial chambers. No one i
who had not the open sesame could
pass the portals, and it seemed strange
to casual observers that an overwhelm. I
ing majority of those that passed the '
doors were railroad agents, ready to
stamp approval of the efforts of the
corrupt Supervisors and to hiss disap- I
probation of the endeavors of those i
that fought for the rights of the people â 
It may have been an accident, but the
!<-mained that railroad hirelings,
from attorneys to loafers, packed the '
main floor and the galleries of the ses- i
Bion chamber. Shortly before the meet- I
ing was called to order the seven sub- i

meeting, that the outrageous proposi- i
tion to permit the Southern Pacific <
Company to operate double tracks

through the Mission should he aban
doned in order that the more vicious
and infinitely more valuable street rail
way concessions might be preserved to
the corporation. It was impossible to
mistake the situation, which was with
out parallel in its evidences of corrup
tion.
The Southern Pacific Company had
issued its commands to its seven repre
sentatives in the board. These seven
chattels stood naked in their shame,
but desperate in their allegiance to
their corporation master. If all which
was demanded could not be secured, the
Southern Pacific Company determined
to sacrifice that which was least valu
able, and the "double track" concession
was dropped. John Russell, clerk of the
board, was commanded to drop all ref
erence to it in the report of the Street
Committee.
The solid seven then filed into the as-
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, MAY 30, 1899.
Fembly chamber for their afternoon
work of planned corruption. As they
filed in they brushed against the ag
gressive representatives of indignant
Mission citizens, who came prepared to
fight against the new outrage of their
rights. The solid seven smiled. They
believed that in robbing the people of
the Mission of an opportunity to pro
test they had cleared the way for the
Perpetration of the outrage which in
street railroad franchises will rob the
city of millions of dollars and saddle
upon the community for fifty years the
dead burden of an unjust monopoly.
The solid seven reckoned without
their host. Without argument and
j without defense they were forced to sit
I in shame as the acknowledged chattels
of the railroad. Through an exciting
; session they saw themselves check
! mated by a persistent, determined op
position fighting for public rights un
der the inspiration of public policy: The
five minority members erf the board and
i the Maynr fought every point and at
tlir end the solid seven saw themselves
cheated of their prize and held up to
public scorn as men who had .sold their
reputations and forgotten the children
who must, bear their names in a com
munity of honorable men.
The meeting had progressed far
through the monotony of routine before
there was a suggestion of the exciting
problems of the day. When the report
of the Street Committee, embodying the
recommendations of franchises to the
Market Street Company, was read Su
pervisor Holland, one of the solid seven,
arose and urged that the rules be sus
pended and that the recommendation*
in reference to franchises be considered
at once. The suggestion of Holland was
a cheap subterfuge the motive of which
was recognized at once. It requires
eight votes to suspend the rules, and
the solid seven, carefully coached by
railroad agents, wanted to trap at least
one member of the minority. The
scheme was seen in time and defeated.
Holland had particularly rme motive
in view. The assembly chamber had
been "packed" by railroad agents, and
the bland Supervisor said that he was
sure men for and against the franchise
were in the room and should be heard.
These men, the Supervisor said, had
been long in attendance, many were
compelled to stand and it would be an
outrage to force them to wait until the
routine business of the board had been
transacted. Common courtesy demand
ed, therefore, in the opinion of the
suave Holland, that the gentlemen
should be heard at once. The bait
caught no fish particularly, as at that
very moment the following protest, late
in being presented, was handed to the
clerk of the board:
The Market Street and Eureka
Valley Improvement Clnb hereby
emphatically proteittM asainnt the
Ki-nndni: of any new frunohloe for
the (ieary ntreet line of the Market
Street Railroad at this time, for the
foi low int reaHoiiH :
First â Ilecaune of ltd Illegality,
the preaent franvbine not having;
terminated.
Second â it In an evident
attempt to thwart the will of the
people as expressed in the new char
ter; and to prevent the possibility
of the people obtaining possession
of the whole street cur system of
this city for half a century, thus
keeping this city behind all the
progressive cities of the world,
which are fast mimin- possession of
all their street cars and roadbeds.
We maintain that these reasons
are paramount to any temporary
advantage* that are claimed by
some to be obtained by granting- the
franchise now.
We hereby certify that this pro
test wan curried unanimously at a
regular meeting of the Market
StrÂ«-Â«-t and lOureka Valley Improve
ment Club, oonsfsttag of seventy
members.

WILLIAM B. DUBOIB, Secretary.
Indorsed by Federation oÂ£ Mis
sion Improvement Clubs.
At Holland's request, however, the
clerk again read all of the atrocious
demands made by the Market Street
Company for local street railroad fran
chises. These outrageous requests
have been frequently described. They
include the bogus surrender of the
BATTLING FOR THE CITY'S RIGHTS.
Geary street franchise and its recap
ture by the Market Street Company
under conditions which preclude com
petition, nine small franchises, the
corkscrew road, including the use of
electricity on Post street and the
change of the motive power to elec
tricity on all roads sdTith of Market
street.
Tho franchise for double tracks,
through the Mission, had significantly
been omitted and Supervisor Byington
asked to be informed in reference to
it. Supervisor Holland and his six as
sociates were dumb. That was alto
gether too delicate a subject to discuss.
Clerk Russell volunteered the informa
tion, however, that the Street Commit
tee had decided not to report on double
tracks.
Mayor Phelan Has the Power to Protect
the City and Save the Community
Millions of Dollars.
Supervisor Byington then made a
motion which precipitated the bat
tle'of the day. He moved that all
of the recommendation!! of the Street
< oniMii i !Â«â â¢-. iii-kluk franchise* for the
Market Street Company, be referred
back to the committee for farther
consideration. The motion provoked
a storm of applause, which the solid
seven met without raining their
heads.
Supervisor Aigeltinger strenuously
objected to delay. He took upon him
self the disagreeable duty of being the
mouthpiece of the railroad during the
controversy of the arternoon. "This
matter has been before the board." he
said, "time and again, and we should
act upon it now."
The utter falsity of the assertion pro
voked a smile as the extravagant de
mands of the Market Street Company
are only a week old.
"When was this matter considered
before?" asked Supervisor Byington.
"If Mr. Byington is particularly anx
ious, to find out," replied Aigeltinger,
sullenly, "he can turn back to the rec
ords four months ago."
"Mr. AiÃeltlnjeer knows," was the
qnick answer of HyiiiKton. "that a
majority of the people of this city
never heard of these applications
for franchises until a week ago.
There are dozens of improvement
clnbs in this city tXat wish to be
heard in reference to this vitally
important business. The citizens
who have appeared before us to-day
represent only the Mission, bat there
are many others who have not had
the opportunity to be heard. I do
not believe that there is upon this
floor a man who 1* honest and wants
to arrant these franchises without
Klvinmr to the people of the city a
hearing-. If we want to be honest
and fair, give these people a
chance."
Again the assembly chamber rang
with applause, but the solid seven were
undaunted. Holland came to the rescue
with an amendment to Byington's mo
tion to refer the matter again to the
Street Committee. Holland moved an
amendment that the visiting citizens be
heard at once. Mayor Phelan declared
the amendment out of order. There was
no appeal from his decision and Bying
ton's original motion was put. As a
matter of course it was lost. The solid
seven had assembled to obey the South
ern Pacific Company and they were not
to be cheated out of the rewards of
obedience.
The Holid seven relaxed to refer
the recommendation* for franchlnen
again to the Street Committee. The

MAYOR PHELAN CAN
BLOCK SUPERVISORS
MAYOR PHELAN has it in his power, and recognizes the fact
in the following interview, to prevent a meeting of the
Board of Supervisors until July 1. He said last night:
"The resources of the law are marvelous when once we
invoke technicalities. The public enemies are not slow to
take every advantage, and in the public defense we are doubtless Justi
fied in demanding strict construction of rules and law.
"After transacting all its business to-day the Board of Supervisors
adjourned to no fixed day. To show the inadequacy of the consolida
tion act to meet the requirements of a great city, which w*as frequently
referred to in the charter campaign, there is no provision for meet
ings of the Board of Supervisors except four times a year.
"The board having adjourned without fixing a day, I would say
at first blush that there legally can be no meeting, unless called by
the Mayor.
"I will look into the necessities of the public business and get the
advice of my attorneys before making any statement.
"The rank iniquity of forcing the Geary street franchise in violation
even of the act of 1897 should put the citizens on guard and when the
board does meet a loud and unmistakable protest should be heard.
The present franchise must be actually surrendered in good faith be
fore a new one can be granted. That is the plain reading of the act
and the penalty for violating any of the conditions of the act by the
Supervisors is removal from office. The attempted sale of a part of
Geary street for the 'corkscrew' route, when Post street would better
serve the Market Street Company, is to prevent the sale of a fran
chise under the charter from the ferries to the park: because if Geary
street is occupied above Market, the 'ten block provision,' by which a
rival may us_e another's tracks, will be defeated, for there then will
be an excess of ten blocks. This is the 'joker.' Geary street is the
battle-ground for the people's rights. If the city takes possession of
that road from the ferries to the Park in 1903, when the franchise lee
ally expires, we will realize an enormous benefit; otherwise we will
have to await street railway reform for thirty-five years, when the
other franchises expire. It means millions to the city.
"This is worth fighting for. and the fight has only begun."
respect and kept their pledge of
decency and honesty in public
office are as follows: Supervisors
Byington, Deasy, Heyer, Lack
mann and Perrault.
When the announcement was made
that the motion was lost Supervisor
Byington changed his vote from "no"
to "aye" and gave notice that at the
next regular meeting he would move
for a reconsideration. Supervisor Aigel
tinger moved, according to the Southern
Pacific programme, that reconsidera
tion be held at once. Aigeltinger was
eager in his demand. His appeal had
all the earnestness of self-interest. He
misquoted fromi rules of parliamentary
law, as Mayor Phelan caustically char
acterized them, "Gushing boiled down."
Every clumsy artifice known to the de
fender of the railroad was used, but to
no purpose. Mayor Phelan was fixed in
his determination to protect the city
and the body over which he presides
from the impudent arrogance of the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
railroad chattels. "I will not entertain
frivolous, unjust and mischievous mo
tions," he said.
Aigeltinger retired in disgrace and
Holland took another chance. He
pleaded that in courtesy to the visiting
citizens they should be heard.
"Then let them appear," interrupted
Supervisor Deasy, "before the Street
Committee in this room next Thursday
afternoon."
The solid seven fwere drifting on to
dangerous ground. Any reference to
the Street Committee sent visions of
reward a-glimmering. Phelps was on
his feet in an instant and with an in
sult and a defiance.
"Let the whole city come here if it
wants to!" he shouted. "Let everybody
come here next Wednesday at 2 o'clock
before the whole board. If this is such
an important affair I move that we
meet then in regular session and invite
everybody."
Supervisor Lackmann showed that
there can be no regular meeting of the
board according to custom until next
Monday.
"Why are you in such unseemly
haste?" asked Supervisor Byington, ad
dressing Phelps.
"I don't have to answer your ques
tion," snapped Phelps.
"I know you don't," was Byington'g
ready reply. "You don't have to an
swer any question that your constitu
ents want."
Phelps replied by demanding that his
motion be put. There was then a long
argument. The solid seven were be
coming tangled and uncertain. They
may be shrewd in obedience, but they
certainly are not crafty in carrying out
their orders. In a moment Byington
spoke to the motion.
"If -we are receiving- orders from
! some one." he Maid, "who holds the
â  whip hand and In driving: the major
ity of this board, then let 11* hanten

! haste will look to their reputations
: and not to the advantage of certain
; people who are operating oataide of
j thitt room, it will be infinitely bet
) ter for themselveii and for their
children after them."
This impassioned rebuke was met
with mingled cheers and hisses. The
railroad lobby had at last commenced a
disturbance which was quelled by the
quick command of Mayor Phelan to the
police to preserve order.
As soon as order was restored Byinjr
ton moved to amend Phelp's motion for
the board to meet to-morrow by lay
ing the motion on the table. From
this point to the end of the session the
struggle of the minority of five, ably
assisted by Mayor Phelan, to save the
city from the outrages planned by the
solid seven in the service of the rail
road was exclusively conducted on
technicalities. The minority knew that
they were fighting in the intei-est of
public policy and they took advantage
of every point permitted by the rules
of the board. Each member of the
minority contributed his share of tech
nical information. Supervisor Perrault
rendering particularly effective service.
The solid seven were mastered at every
turn. They should have been better
coached.
Byington's amendment was of course

clean scores, but it has not prevented
Clarence Hafght from getting one to his
credit. It was the first clean twenty

Halgrit brought them down he received
the applause of the grand stand and was
soon surrounded by friends offering him
their congratulations.
The Olympic "Club boys are much in
evidence in their pretty uniforms. They

is a good shot, too, and that makes him
all the more conspicuous. He made a

In this way the money is pretty equally j

they are iii the minority, however, their

SAX DIEGO, May 29.â Excitement over
he Si-rra Pintada placers of Lower Cali
ornia grew more intense to-day in this
ity. The whole city has been talking of
lothing else. The schooner Santa Bar
>ara did not arrive at San Quintin from
n landing to-day as was .\
--tected, but that fact made very little
lifference with the people interested in
he placers. It is considered very Improb
ible that the Santa Barbara will bring
inything but the most encouraging news
'â ncoming the new fields. Enough al
"eady has been learned from mining men
n Lower California to justify the rush

TRAINING HARD
FOR THE FIGHT
Fitz Making His Final
Preparations.
Special Dispatch to The Can.
NEW YORK, May 29.â Champion
Fitzslmmons to-day started in on his
final preparation for his battle with
Jeffries. Although the champion has
decided to cut out some of his routine
work from his regular schedule. Lanky
Bob expects to be a pretty busy man
up to the day of the fistic argument.
Bob has revised his schedule and will
in future take little road work. Spins
of ten or twelve miles have been the
feature of the Australian's training.
but he has trained down to the weight
at which he desires to flght, and he
will now devote considerable time to
boxing and punching the bag. This is
I to harden his muscles and other tender
I parts which need a little bracing up.
Fitzsimmons is well pleased with the
result <>f his preliminary work, and,
barring accidents, he expects to be in
j better physical condition than in any
,of his previous fights. Notwithstand
ing the announcement made by the
managers of the Coney Island Sporting
Club that no women will be allowed to
I see the Jeffries-Fitzsimmons fight. Mrs.
I Fitzsimmons may be present and oc
; cupy a seat near her husband's corner.
â  It will be remembered that when the
lanky Australian won the championship
at Carson City she was present and
aided materially in advising her hus
band how to defeat Corbett.'
Jeffries returned to Asbury Park from
New York this morning bright and
early, and a few minutes after his ar
, rival be was paced by ROM O'Neil in
a bicycle run for seven miles. It has
i been practically decided that Jeffries'
i seconds will be made up from the train
-1 ing camp, and that Tommy Ryan will
be in his corner the night of the fight.
The California!! said this mornine.
when asked if he thought the battle
would go the limit, that ten rounds
would settle it unless Fitz ran away.
j "I never heard of Fitz running away."
he added, "and there is every reason to
believe that it will be a tussle at close
quarters from start to finish."
Jeffries does not believe, as some ring
experts pretend to say, that his addi
tional weight is a disadvantage. It
might be so were he a slow man. but
those who know his alertness in the
arena are inclined to think that extra
weight when properly used will be more
of an advantage than a disadvantage.

ARCHBISHOP KEANE
WILL NOT BE RECTOR
WASHINGTON, May 29.-An authorita
tive denial was given to-day to the state
ment set atloat yesterday that Archbishop
ECeane was about to return from Rome to
resume his old post as rector of the <'ath
olic University, Bftcmslgnor Conaty, the
present rector, retiring to become Bishop
of Columbus. Monsignor ("onaly to-day
authorized the following statement:
"At the meeting of the board of trus
tees of the Catholic University held at the
university last October a request was
made by the trustees that Most Rev.
Archbishop Kcane be asked to devote a
year or more of his time to help in the
completion of the endowment of the uni
versity, so that with the beginning of the
century the university might be fully en
dowed. Archbishop Keane, with that dis
interestedness which has always charac
terized his devotion to the university from
the beginning of its work, agreed to do
â whatever the Right Rev. rector and the
trustees might desire, provided the neces
sary permission was obtained from the
Holy See. This was received and Arch
bishop Keane will arrive in the United
States the latter part of September to be-
his work In conjunction with the
Right Rev. rc-etor and trustees."

ONE NUGGET
ALL THE GOLD
ON BOARD
Steamship Curacao Brings
News of the Lower Cali
fornia Placers.
The steamer Curacao arrived from
Mexican ports yesterday with the first
news thai has come direct from the gold
ti-lds of Lower California. The officers of
the vessel report great excitement at
Santa Rosalia and Ensenada and it was
almost impossible to obtain laborers at
either place owing to the exodus. The
gold is said to be plentiful and the miners
average from one-half ounce to two
ounces a day. The dust and nuggets are
very pure, being nearly 900 tine and worth
$UI an ounce. F. Andunaegui of the firm
of Andonaegui & Ormart, Ensenada, was
one of the passengers by the Curacao.
"Very little if any gold has come into
Ensenada from the placer mines." said
he. yesterday. "An American with dust
valued at from $2000 up as high as $8000 is
said to have COOK in. but I did not see
him. His arrival is the only event I can
think of that would give rise to the story
that gold dust to th.- value of $150,000 was
shipped on the Curacao. About the only
gold from the min<s on the vessel is what
1 have in this small nugget, and that is
not more than; five ounces. It is the pur
est and prettiest sample of the metal I
have ever Been, and they Bay that all the
product of that district is the same.
"Ensenada is th" port of entry for the
new gold fields, 'l hence prospectors must
go by steam or sail to a place called Asun
cion, an open roadstead between Point San
Domingo and a small port called Santo
I)nmingo. The fare to Asuncion Is $35 and
$30 Mexican money. After landing there
the miner in search of the gold fields will
have to walk at least fifteen miles over
the desert sands unless he by great good
luck strikes a bullock team. Of course a
good many people are going by way of
Santo Domingo and Santa Rosalia, but
while it is easier to land at those places
it means a longer walk over the sands
than it does from Asuncion.
"The placers are three miles long and
one mile wide, and if all the reports are
true they are very rich. At Calmallf the
Ybarra gold mine Is closed. All the hands
deserted and have gone to the new field.
At Ensenada and Santa Rosalia there are
no teams to be had and no one to do ex
tra work, as everybody has gone to the
gold fields. Many of the business men of
Lower California have gone to investigate
the find and if it is what it is reported to
be they will start in business on the fields.
For the present everybody who goes in
must take his own provisions with him.
We left Ensenada last Saturday and up
to that time the only supply of water on
the field was from Coyote Spring, al
though plenty was to be got from the hills
eight miles away.
"At Santa Rosalia It was reported that
a Spaniard had come in with three pounds
Of dust and nuggets. In fact, his wife was
aboard the steamer and told the story
herself. 1 am satisfied there is plenty of
gold in the new placers but there is also
going to be plenty of hardship In getting
It and far more people will take out half
an. ounce a day than will take two
ounces."
The Curacao will sail again for Ensen
ada and other Mexican ports the latter
part of this week and quite a number of
miners have engaged passage on her.
S'im^ of those who quailed before the
rigors of an Arctic winter on the Yukon
are now going to try the effects of the
torrid zone.
TEN JURORS SWORN
TO TRY YDA ADDIS
SANTA BARBARA, May 20.â The trial
of Yda Addis Stnrke, the divorced wife
of C. A. Storke of this city, and who is
sharped with having written llbelous let
ters concerning Dr. R. F. "Winchester, be
gan this morning. The defendant is the
writer who under the itame. "Yda Addis"
in former years won considerable reputa
tion. Her name has been prominent In
the court calendars for ten years past.
Dr. R. K. Winchester is a physician of
good standing in this city.

anonymous letters were received by va
rious persons in this city,- to the number
of forty or fifty, all having as the burden
of their story charges against the doctor
and certain women of the city, who bore
excellent characters. The charges were
of a character that cannot well be put.
into print. The postal authorities took
the case under investigation and had a
postal officer investigate. He finally be
came convinced that- the writer of the
letters was Mrs. Storke, and so reported
to the Federal authorities. They thought
the offense was one more properly tria
ble in the State courts and recommended
that action be brought there. Vnder
these circumstances the case was brought
before the Grand Jury of this county in
December resulting in a charge of Hbel
against Yda Addis.
The case will hinge on a Question of
handwriting. The iury i? to say whether
the handwriting is that of the defendant.
Theodore Kytka is the expert who will
Dfl sworn as to the handwriting.
Ten jurors were sworn to-day and the
panel was exhausted. An order for more
jurors was made and the case will go on

JAPANESE TO VOTE
IN HAWAII'S ELECTION
HONOLULU, May 22.â One full-blooded
Japanese will vote in the election next
: fall for Senators and representatives. The
man is Toma Abe, a Japanese policeman.
; T^ie right to vote comes in under the
| "service" clause of the constitution.
Toma served with the present Govern
ment in the revolution of 1893 and the out
break in 1895. Up to July 4, 1894, he had
been in constant support of the provi
sional government, for which he was, un
â â  der the constitution, given a certificate
j of special rights of citizenship.
Torha did not try to register in 1896,
1 anticipating some objection and trouble
: about it. but made up his mind then that
he would try it this year. Another thing
that hurried him up is a desire he has
! had for years to become an American cit
izen. Toma cut his nationality long ago,
and has been heard more than once to
tell his countrymen that he was not a
Japanese, but an American. : ' . =â¢Â£â¢
Early in the present year he took the
I new oath to support the constitution and
laws of both the United States and Ha
: waii. Then he applied to the Supreme
: Court for a certificate that he was enti-
I tied to vote. This morning Toma laid be
i fore Registrar Fred Oat the following
declaration, signed by Chief Justice Judd
'. and sealed with the seal of the Supremo
, Court. ','?*">?.?â¢
Be it remembered that on the sth flay of
January, 1899, Toma Abe, an alien, and late
a subject or citizen of Japan, applied In writ-
Ing to ft Justice of the Supreme Court to
be admitted a citizen of the republic of Ha
waii, pursuant to the constitution thereof in
relation thereto, and, it appearing by the said
application and by other satisfactory- proofs
that he has procured from the Minister of the
Interior a certificate of service, entitling him.
to be naturalized without further qualification,
and the said Toma Abe having on the nth day
of January. 1899, taken and subscribed to the
oath required by the constitution before George
Lucas, clerk of the Supreme Court, > .>
Therefore I do admit the said Toma Abe
and declare him to be a citizen of the repub
lic of Hawaii.
This settled the matter so far as the
Board of Registration was concerned and
the man was duly registered. .

ARBITRATION IS CONSIDERED
ITALY AMENDS THE RUSSIAN
PROJECT.
Later On Uncle Sam's Representa

a Permanent Court of
Arbitration.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
THE HAGUE, May 29.â The drafting
. committee, or sub-committee of the ar
j bitration committee, met to-day and
! discussed the Russian scheme, adopt
ing with slight modifications the first
i six articles.
Count Nigra, chief of the Italian del
| egation, submitted a proposal of media
j tion and arbitration consisting of six
articles in the form of an amendment
to the Russian project.
The Americans also submitted an
amendment demanding that, in the
event of a dispute between two nations,
each should choose another nation to
act together as arbitrators to settle
the differences without bloodshed. This
must not be confounded with the pro
posal for a permanent arbitration tri
bunal which the Americans will intro
duce during the week.
The Italian proposal includes a clause
providing thai mediation and arbitra
tion shall not stop mobilization or prep
arations for war. Neither the Ameri
can nor the Italian amendment has yet
been discussed.
The naval and military sections of the
disarmament committee both met to
day and exchanged ideas in a desultory
manner. The impression gains ground
that the outcome of the committee will
be practically nil.
A brief official record of the doings of
the pecce conference during the last
week says: "Provisional proposals for
mediation and arbitration have been
submitted by the representatives of
Russia, Great Britain, Italy and the
United States."
The co-respondent here of the Asso
ciated Press learns that the statement
that the Americans have submitted an
arbitration proposal is incorrect. Their
proposals for a. permanent tribunal are
not ready, as a French translation is
necessary. They will probably be sub
mitted on Wednesday.

the Belgian markets to American cattle
they having been closed since- 1804. Upon
the organization of the reciprocity office
under President McKinley's administra
tion the chief of that office took up the
Belgian question and negotiations have
been going- on for a year, which have now
come to a successful conclusion, as is
shown by the following dispatch received
by the Belgian Minister, Count Llchter
velde, to-day:
â â MrusKels-The Moniteur (official organ)
of the 2bth publishes a decree raising the
interdict on American cattle. The new
regime ordered by royal decree of the 326
or January. 1807, is applicable from and
after the Slst of May."
The decree referred to permits im
portation of bovine, ovine and porcine
species at. Antwerp, Ghent and Oatend,
provided that the animals be slaughtered
there or in the vicinity of abattoirs within
three days after debarkation.

Destructive Changes Due to
Foreign Elements in
the Blood.
HOW TO OBTAIN POSITIVE AND
PERMANENT RELIEF.
"When the digestive and excretory organs fail
to perform their proper functions the blood he-
comes contaminated with poisonous matters
that bring on Bufferings and disease. Inactivity
of the liver, sluggishness of the bowels, indi-
gestion, and sluggishness of the kidneys all
serve to assist in the accumulation of theae
foreign elements. ,
Rheumatism is the most common of the dis-
eases that arise as a result of the above condi-
tions. The character of the life-fluid (the
blood) Is chanced, for foreign acids now go
to make up its composition. These acids give
rise to pain and suffering. Fibrinous deposits
in the joints result, causing stiffness of the
joints and consequent enlargement.
What Is necessary to correct this evil? The
question is easy to answer. A remedy is
needed that will destroy the activity of these
acid poisons, and that will eliminate them from
the blood. Hudyan performs this work admir-
ably. Hudyan cures Rheumatism, because it
neutralizes these DOiSons, it strengthens the
kidneys and stimulates them to increased
activity in order that these poisons may be
filtered from the blood and discharged from
the body.
Hudyan is a preventive as well as a cure
tor rheumatism, gout, headache, pain in back,
tain in limbs, pale and sallow complexions,
[{right's disease, etc.. for it corrects all those
ionditioris that create these poisons, as enumer-
ited above.
Hudyan cures all diseases of the Stomach-
.liverâ â Kidneysâ Blood. Hudyan cures
ire permanent.

STOCKHOLM, May' 29.â
According to a dispatch
-y from Helsingfors, capital
of Finland, published by the Af-
tenbladet, the Finnish Diet will
virtually reject the Government
army bill by adopting the bill
recommended by the army com- 1
mittee, raising the strength of the
army from 5000 to 13,000 men.!
and providing that as a condition,
of the service performed the I
Finnish army is to retain its na
tional character and is only to be â 
employed outside of Finland
when the defense of Finland does
not require it, and the Landwehr
is only to be employed in Finland
except in a case of emergency,
when it may be used in defense of \
St. Petersburg.
The Diet also asks the Czar, if
he cannot sanction the bill, to
submit a new bill, to be dealt with
in a constitutional manner.

that this wld.--reaching franchise,

extend Its operations from one end of the
country to the other, taking in all of the

It will collect freight, see to the billing

OTIS HAS
CALLED FOR
MORE MEN
Additional Troops Needed to
Pacify the Philippine
Insurgents.
VOLUNTEERS NEEDED
Peace Commissioners and Diplomaoy
Must Take a Back Seat Until
Tagals Are Whipped.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. May 29.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: The question of calling for
volunteers for continuing the war in
the Philippines will probably come up
asain at to-morrow's session of the
Cabinet. The situation in the islands,
as described in recent dispatches, is
such as to make it almost necessary
t.i raise at least a part of th<> provi
sional army authorized by the last
Congress, if the United States expects
t>< s -rure complete control of the archi
polngo.
The administration has been brought
to realize that It is no longer war and
diplomacy in dealing with the insur
gents, but plain war. Diplomacy and
the Peace Commission must take back
seats until the enemy has been com
pletely whipped and forced to surren
der.
General Otis has not a sufficient num
ber of men to accomplish this end. It
is believed that he has so informed the
War Department, but the officials will
not admit it. They do admit; how
ever, that the outlook for an early
peace is very gloomy, and that more
troops are badly needed in the Philip
pines,
Just how to meet this situation is the
question which confronts them and re
quires prompt decision. Although Gen
eral Otis states that he will continue an
aggressive campaign during the rainy
Beason, it is appreciated that he will
be able to do little more than garrison
some of the points which the forces un
der Generals Mac Arthur and Lawton
have taken, and hold them until the
rainy season is over. It is also plain
that there will be more or less illness
during this period Of bad weather, and
that when the campaign is resumed
the force capable of active warfare will
be materially reduced. It is expect,,]
that the President will discuss all
phases of the situation with the Cab
inet to-morrow and reach an early de
cision.

An order has been issued re-establishing
the Philippine courts, which have been
closed since the American occupation. It
revives all the Spanish system not con
liirtinfj with the sovereignty of the
United States. The Chief Justice is Cay
tuma Arrelano. The associates of the
Civil branch are Manuel Arnulla, Colonel
Crowder and Gregorlo Arllita. The Jus
tices of the criminal branch are Raymun
do Mellisa. Ambroslo Rianarea, Julio Lo
rerito, Major Young and Captain Blrkhi
nu-r. The Attorney General is Florento
Torres. This corresponds with ihe Ameri
can Supreme Court.
The oath prescribed he^ins. "I recognize
anil accept the supreme authority of the
I'nitec] States of America," etc. The Fili
pino members are all prominent lawyers.
Arrelano Is the leader of his profession
in the Islands. In the early stages of
the Filipino movement he was Apui
naldo's principal adviser. Arillta was a
member of Aguinaldo's first <'abinet.
Mellisa was president of the insurgent
government at Iloilo; Torres was the
leader of the local committee working
with the commission to conciliate the in-
Burrectos. Spanish will be the official
language of trie courts.
There has been agitation among the
local British and American business men
and American lawyers who came to the
lslunds to make fortunes to have the Eng
lish language and code adopted, but Gen
eral Otis concluded that, it would be un
wise, even if it were practicable, to upset
long usage. He thought It best to gl\e
the native courts the language to
which they have been accustomed. Tho
Spanish salaries proved a stumbling block
to obtaining jrood men. the highest being
only JJ.Vjo. the Spanish Judges receiving
fees, which are abolished. All the Judges
are representative men.
The steamer El Cano has arrived here
from the Island of Guam, bringing the
Filipinos who were exiled there by the
Spaniards for participating in the old re
bellion.

DREYFUS TO GET A REHEARING
REPORT OF
COURT OF
CASSATION
Everything Points to the In
nocence of the Devils
Island Prisoner.
ESTERIIAZY IS GUILTY
The People of Paris Listen to the
Evidence Without Showing
Excitement.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS. May 29.â The Court of Cassa
tion met to-day to hear the debate on
the application for a revision of the
! Dreyfus case. The doors of the Palace
of Justice were opened at 11 o'clock.
Persons connected with the case, news
paper men and others, began to arrive
I half an hour previously. There was
much animation in the lobbies of the
1 palace, but the crowds in the vicinity
' were not larg^e. Extensive precautions
i.were taken to preserve order inside and
outside the building. The colonel
commanding the guard at the Palace
\ had been given special reinforcements
by the Military Governor of Paris, Gen
eral Zurlinden, and considerable forces
of military and mounted police had
been assembled at the barracks in the
i vicinity of the court. Speculators
about the palace were selling seats' at
points of vantage for ten to twenty
francs each, but the business done was
not as good as during the Zola trial,
when they easily obtained forty francs
Cor seats.
The courtroom was filled with Par
i isian celebrities, the greater part of the
j hall having been reserved for ticket
i holders. Many Judges belonging to
! other courts were among those present,
and absolute tranquillity prevailed.
There were about twenty ladies among
: the audience filling the galleries.
The proceedings commenced at noon.
Amid profound silence the President of
| the civil section of the court read his
I report on the case. After recalling the
\ contentions under which the prosecu
tion of Dreyfus was Instituted in 1894
he dealt with the contradictory evi
dence of the experts In handwriting and
mentioned the protest of innocence by
; Dreyfus, who said to Lieutenant Col
onel Henry : "This odious accusation
is the death of my lit'--. I must have
justice dealt me." Henry replied that
the matter did not come within his
I competence.
! M. Ballot de Bfaupre then read a
| number of eulogistic reports on Drey
| fus, when the latter was a military
; school probationer on the general staff,
; his interrogatory by Lieutenant Colonel
I dv Paty de Clam, In which Dreyfus
j persisted in denying having had re
i lations with any foreign embassy, and
j his statement that he had not eiven
any documents to any agent relating
to the defenses of the country. The
reporter afterward describes the scene
in Dv Paty de Clam's office in the pres
'â¢ ence of Chief of Detectives M. Roche
! fort, and sketched the history of the
I Dreyfus family.
According to Dv Paty de Clam. Drey
i fus, when he saw the resemblance to
i his handwriting, exclaimed: "They
i have stolen my handwriting." It was
also pointed out that Dreyfus, when the
report of Ormes-Chevilles was printed
i at the court martial, protested he had
. never seen the new gun used, and that
: he did not know before July of the
disposition of the frontier forces. The
prisoner also said he had not had a
capy.of the firing manual, knew noth
: ing of the documents respecting Mada
'â . gascar and said to the reporter of the
: court martial: "I have now been more
than six weeks In confinement. I swear
I am innocent. The son of an Alsatian
! Protestant, I abandoned everything: to
; serve France, and I am to-day worthy
â¢ of leading her soldiers on the battle
| field. The martyrdom I suffer is atro
cious."
M. Ballot de Beaupre then dealt with
j the Ormes-Chevilles report of Dreyfus'
â  relations with married women.
The report said the first suspicion
of Dreyfus emanated from Colonel
Fabre, who was struck with the sim
' ilarity of the word "artillery" In the
| bordereau and in a document written
Iby Dreyfus. Continuing, the report
dealt with Lieutenant Colonel Henry's
â  account of his conversation with Drev
-1 fus when the latter was transferred to
I the Cherche Midi prison. Dreyfus said:
I "It is terrible. I am accused of a
! frightful thing."
Henry asked of what he was accused
and Dreyfus replied: "I am accused
of the crime of high treason."
"The devil!" answered Henry, "but
! on what grounds?"

PARISIANS WEARY
OF BOTH THE CASES
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899,
by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, May 29.â There will be no lack of interest in the week that
opens to-day. Both the Dreyfus and Deroulede affairs come before the
courts, while all sorts of preparations are being made to give Major
Marchand a worthy welcome when he returns on Thursday. This same
welcome promises to be very funny, for the historical enthusiasm of the
self-styled nationalists has naturally called forth a retort from the oppo
site party that soldiers who do their duty are so. rare that one who does
is immediately hailed as a self-sacrificing hero.
As far as the public is concerned there is absolutely not an atom of
excitement. It almost seems as if everybody were sick and tired of the
whole business. There is no likelihood of any disturbance.
M. Comely in to-day's Figaro gives the best reason, namely, that
there are 8000 policemen in Paris, while it is not likely that that number
of Parisians are willing to risk a black eye over either Dreyfus or De
roulede.
"I don't know," said Dreyfus. "I
am nearly mad. I would prefer to re
ceive a bullet in the head. I am n<rt
guilty. This accusation is the death uf
my life."
To this Henry said: "If you are not
guilty you must not lose your head.
An innocent man is always strong.
Have you a family?"
"Yes." replied the prisoner, "a wife
and children. I am â¢well off and I must
have Justice done me."
"That does not come within my com
petence," was Henry's next remark,
"but justice will certainly be done. Do
you know what you are accused of?"
"Yes, I am accused of giving docu
ments to a foreign power."
"What documents?"
"I don't know. Dv Paty de Clam
spoke only <,-f secret and confidential
documents without further explanation.
I replied that during my probation at
the general staff office many documents
passed through my hands, but that I
communicated them to nobody."
The Ormrs-i 'hcvillr-s report concluded
with saying that Dreyfus, having a
supple and very obsequious character,
was adapted for espionage.
M. Ballot de Beaupre than reviewed
th<^ judicial history of the case and
said it now rested with the court to
pronounce judgment. He upheld the
statement that there was sufficient
presumption, that doubts and errors ex
isted and that they justified a revision
of the case. He had examined the dif
ferent cases in which the court could
annul a sentence without retrial, and
said that in his opinion the court ought
not to consider the idea of annulling
the sentence, but should only consider
a revision of it.
The revision, he contended, was im
perative, and in support of his state
ment he rehearsed the facts on which
the application for a revision was based,
among which he included the culpable
machinations of Henry and Dv Paty
de Olam- against Dreyfus, their out
rageous schemes to force the hand of
the Minister of War and oblige him to
prosecute Dreyfus and the convincing
effects of their depositions on the court
martial.
After reading M. Mornard's defense,
â which concluded by maintaining that
the material evidence of the bordereau
and the moral evidence cropping out
during the inquiry pointed not to Drey
fus but to Esterhazy as the culprit, M.
Ballot de Beaupre dealt with the ques
tion of motive. He read the police re
the. meeting had adjourned, "that my
rulings were invariably fair and I in
sist that they were all dictated by my
sense of what is honest public policy."
A great fight had been won, and it
now remains with Mayor Phelan to
make permanent the victory, as he
needs not unless he wishes call another
meeting of the board before the first
Monday in July. The law upon that
point is explicit and clear. It Is at the
discretion of Ma y or Phelan to save or
lose the city millions of dollars and to
free or burden the community with a
gigantic monopoly.
RUSSELL ON THE ACT.
Thinks the Board Cannot Meet
Until July.
Supervisor Lackmann claims the dis
tinction of having forced the discovery
of the fortunate blunder which the
virtuous board made when it adjourn
ed without fixing a certain time for the
next meeting. "It seemed to me soon
after the adjournment was taken," he
said last night, "that the board could
not convene until next Monday unless
by special call from the Mayor. I went
to John Russell and he looked over the
consolidation act. After a reading Qf
it he expressed an opinion that trie
board could not come together for offi
cial business until July, pro
vided the Mayor did not call
a special meeting. He thought
the action which appointed spe
cial meeting days was mandatory
ports furnished by M. Guene, the de
tective, all unfavorable to Dreyfus, and
reports of the Prefecture of Police,
pointing out that there had been a con
fusion of Dreyfus with others of the
same name who had been mixed up
with gambling and disreputable fe
male associates. The .latter reports
were not produced at the trial in 1894.
M. Ballot de Beaupre then pointed
out that Dreyfus could not ha.ye acted
as a traitor from anger or disappoint
ment, as he had the finest prospects of
an excellent military career. On the
other hand Esterhazy. the" reporter al
leged, was a soldier of fortune, always
begging from the money lenders.
Continuing, the reporter refers to let
ters written by Esterhazy abusing
France and the French, this producing
a deep impression upon the audience.
He referred to the letter written by
Esterhazy to Baron Rothschild, dated
June 21, 1894, to the effect that if his ap
plication for money was refused he
would have no resource but to kill his
family and then to commit suicide.
Such, said the reporter, was Ester
hazys language on the eve of the date
when the bordereau was "placed." The
inference to be drawn was that Ester
hazy pought in treason resources neces
sary to carry on a life of dissipation.
At this point, with the evident ap
proval of all who listened, M. Ballot
de Beaupre quoted from M. Mornard's
statement as follows: "Although
justice has been rendered more or less
Impotent with regard to Esterhazy by
the latter's acquittal of being the au
thor of the bordereau, it is none the
less the duty of the Supreme Court to
restore liberty to an innocent man un
justly condemned."
Prior to the adjournment M. Ballot de
Beaupre read a letter from the British
general, Talbot, who. in 1894, was at
tached to the British Embassy in Paris
rectifying the deposition of General
Marquis de Gallifet. This letter reach
ed M. Mazeau through diplomatic chan
nels. In it General Talbot said that
Marquis de Gallifet had misinterpreted
his (Talbot's) words, as he had never
had personal relations with Esterhazy
In the way of espionage, but had simply
heard that Esterhazy's charcter was
well known to the foreign military at
taches.
The court adjourned at 6:30, when
very few of the public yet remained in
the vicinity. The Republican Guards
immediately returned to barracks and
the cordon of police was dispersed.
and that there were no other regular
times for convocation. When the
board adjourned without setting a defi
nite date for reconvocation they cut a
month out of their Supervisorial life.
Russell was of the opinion that the en
tire matter was now in the hands of
the Mayor and that the board could
not go outside of the statute in order
to meet before July."
MEMORIAL SERVICES.
Patriotic Exercises in the Normal
School at San Jose.
SAN JOSE, May 29.â Special memorial
services were held at the Normal School
this morning. The place was prettily
decorated and an interesting programme
was rendered.
The exercises opened with scripture
reading and the chanting of the Lord's
Prayer, followed by the song "Keller's
American Hymn," by the entire school.
As a recitation Miss Maude Hue gave
"Memorial Day." The address of the day
was by Rev. Dr. Kummer, and he took
for his subject, "Grant, the True Ameri
can Soldier." He reviewed General
Grant's life and eloquently pointed out
his great work and faith in the trouble
some days of the rebellion. The man was
one of the great mass of people, but so
big and great, with so large a heart, that
when at last the summons came which
took him to eternity, the whole country,
even those who had been in arms against
him, mourned for his loss. Dr. Kummer
was frequently applauded.
Miss Ara Gass and Miss Northrup
gave a vocal duet and Mrs. Esther Mal
com Johnson gavo a select reading. The
"Recessional Song" by the Â£ecilia Club
closed the exercises.

DEROULEDE
AND HABERT
ARRAIGNED
Agitators Make Most Defiant
Harangues at the Open
ing of Their Trial.
THEY DISLIKE LOUBET!
Men Wqo Tried to Incite Soldiers
to Insubordination Applauded
by the People.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, May 29.â While the Dreyfus
case was proceeding to-day in one part
of the Palace of Justice, the Assize
Court, on the other side of the build
ing, was occupied with the trial of MM.
Deroulede and Marcel-Habert, who are j
charged with inciting soldiers to in
subordination on the day of the elec
tion of President Loubet. Conspicuous,
among the audience were MM. Roche
fort, Colonel Monteil, Francoise Copf>e
and Quesnay de Beaurepaire, former
president of the civil section of the
Court of Cassation.
As the defendants entered some of the
spectators cheered. The reading of the
indictment caused some murmurs.
Mhen M. Deroulede, who is a mem
ber of the Chamber of Deputies and
creator, in 1882, of the League of Pa
triots, was called upon to plead he be
gan a diatribe against parliamentar
ians and the Jews. During the course
of his remarks he declared his action
was maturely weighed and reminded
the court that he created Boulangism
in order to save France.
The audience in court cheered MM.
Deroulede and Habert and cried "Here
is a jury of acquittal" when the jury
men entered.
Murmurs were heard when the
charges against the prisoners were
read. The presiding Judge then asked
M. Deroulede how he, a former officer
Of the army and the soldiers' lyrist (M.
Deroulede is the author of "Chants dv
Soldat" and "Nouveaux Chants dv Sol
dat"). could wish to turn the army
away from its duty. To this M. De
roulede replied, amid laughter,, with
comparing Premier Dupuy to- the frog
in the fable, and said he (defendant)
wished to lead a brigade to overthrow
the Parliament republic, adding that
his action was fully premeditated.
M. Deroulede, who spoke in a loud
voice, then gave an account of his life
and relations with Gambetta, with
whom, he said, he had a "communion of
ideas." Continuing, M. Deroulede said
that when M. GambettÂ« disappeared he
(the defendant) was disgusted to see
extortion and bribery reign at the Pa
lais Bourbon, saying: "We then cre
ated Boulangism. When that ended
two plagues descended upon France â
Panama, a sign of parliamentary de
composition, and Dreyfus, a sign of na
tional decomposition, for which par
liament is responsible. I am not sur
prised there was a reaction which was
neither royalist nor imperialist, but
popular reaction, which was inevitable.
The false constitution of 1875, the draft
ers of which wished to place the people
in the King's bed, which explains why
the people sleep so soundly."
M. Deroulede then arraigned the
constitution and the budget of defense,
saying it was increasing daily and that
France was approaching a deficit. He
also attacked the budget of public
works, saying the number of civil ser
vants was increasing incessantly.
Deroulede then eulogized the work
of the French explorers Marchand.
Monteil and Binger and attacked Lou
bet. He finished his harangue by de
manding a pleblscltary republic, assert
ing at the same time th%t he never in
tended to turn the soldiers from their
duty, but only wished to carry Gen
eral Roget with him.
M. Marcel-Habert followed. He ad
mitted that he wished to cause a revo
lution, but denied having incited sol
diers to disobedience. He said he only
thought to lead General Roget to the
Elysee Palace and that the men with
him (Habert) had been merely follow-
ing officers.
Habert also harangued against par
liamentarism, saying the Chamber of
Deputies was empty when useful ques
tions were discussed and that the Sen
ate was dilatory.
The presiding Judge stopped M. De
roulede when the latter referred to
President Loubet, declaring he must
not bring the name of the President of
the republic into the case.
To this M. Deroulede replied that ho
was obliged to mention the President
because his election determined him to
take action. He proceeded to make an
other attack upon M. Loubet, but was
again called to order, and M. Derou
lede retorted hotly that he wanted to
drive M. Loubet out of the Elysee Pal
ace, which, he said, he had only
reached, "thanks to his mediocrity."
When Deroulede concluded he was
loudly acclaimed by the 1 audience.
A violent altercation ensued later be
tween the Judge and counsel for the
defense on a question of order. It was
settled by counsel apologizing.
Subsequently M. Delourede acknowl
edged he was guilty of all the charges
except the allegation that he wanted to
lead the soldiers astray witnout a lead
er. He shouted:
"I wanted a general at their head. I
found only a brigadier general. I
would have preferred the commander
in chief. Unhappily I had no choice."
Evidence already known was then
presented and the court adjourned
amid the cries of "Vive Deroulede"
within and without the hall.
As the court emptied the crowd made
a demonstration. Cries of "Vive l'Ar
mee," "Abas le Juifs" and "A Mort les
Traitres" resounded. The police routed
the demonstrators and then dispersed a
band of members of the League of Pa
triots.
A crowd of anti-Semites attempted to
hold a noisy meeting in the Place dv
Chatelet and a slight collision with the
police resulted. There was another
demonstration in the Place Dauphine,
where opposing bands, shouting "Vive
l'Armee and "A bas l'Armee" came
into collision, a few persons being in
jured. ___^^_________

CUBANS NOW
APPLY FOR
THE MONEY
Many Are Coming Forward
to Surrender Arms and
Get Their Pay.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, May 29.â T0-day's events
in connection with the payment of the
Cuban troops entitled to apply here for
a share in the American gratuity have
effectually killed off the opposition to
the receipt of the bounty by privates.
Three hundred privates arrived during
the day to apply for payment, but
though the commissioner superintend
ing the distribution here kept his office
open from 10 a. m. to 5 p. m., only 112
co\ild be paid during that interval, as
each man took up several minutes.
Many who brought arms were not on
the rolls at all. Ninety-nine rifles were
surrendered, most of the applicants de
clining to take any chances in turning
the weapons over to the Mayor of Ha
vana, evidently believing it would be
better to give them direct to the Amer
icans.
All day it was virtually impossible to
get through the front door of the office
unless the sentry cleared the way. The
Cuban officers who on the first day
tried to discourage those who were in
clined to apply, finding now that the
tide of feeling has turned, are offering
all the assistance possible to Colonel
Randall.
At the conclusion of the day's work
there were more than 200 who had not
been heard. These will have to wait
until after the return of the pay car on
June 16, when there will probably be
extra days assigned to Havana.
To-morrow the pay car will leave,
carrying money. Colonel Randall, his
escort, a physician and the paymasters.
One thousand posters were sent this
afternoon into the province of Pinar
del Rio to announce the places and
dates of payment.

The electric car was coming into the
city and the train was just starting out j
for Olympia. They met nearly head on j
at the intersection of the two tracks. The
passengers of the electric car were all
thrown Into the bay, where the water was
nearly fifteen feet* deep. It is a wonder i
that no one was drowned during the panic
that followed the collision. So far as is
known every one is accounted for.
, When Motorman Sharpe of the electric
car sa\y the train approaching he applied
the brakes with all his power, but the j
track was slippery and his car crashed
into the locomotive. The passengers made
frantic efforts to get out of the car. The
motorman and conductor succeeded in
jumping off the platform, but an instant
later the engine of the train crashed into â 
the street car and nearly all the passen
gers were thrown into the water below.
Manuel Broad succeeded in getting off
the car but could not get out of its way, ;
and when the engine hit the car he was
struck by it and knocked into the water.
Without a moment's hesitation, although
terribly injured internally, he grabbed a
pile and held on. When another passen
ger on the car was about to sink the in- j
jured man grabbed him with hi* free arm
and held him up until a rope could be let
down and both of them hauled up. Broad
died on the way to the hospital. .
As quickly as possible the train was
stopped and the train crew, assisted by
employe;* of the Washington Iron Works,
made heroic efforts to get the frightened |
passengers out of. th water. with ropes
and boards every one was quickly taken
out. Some were clinging to piles, some
were struggling and swimming about and j
others were crawling up the piles and
timbers. Everything was in the greatest
confusion. The wrecked electric car lay j
on Its Bide almost at right angles with j
the rails, while the passenger train was
some fifty feet distant from where the
electric car lay. The locomotive headlight ;
was broken and the cowcatcher was
badly deranged, while the whole front
end was covered with broken glass and
debris from the electric car.
Harry E. Bull says he was sitting in the
front end of the car on the right hand I
aide. All he remembers was a crash and j
then he fell himself going through the
window of the car into the bay. lie was
able to swim and after coming to the
surface reached a pile and crawled upon <
the trestle.
George Lindoff was not so fortunate.
He became inextricably mixed up in the
confused mass of humanity trying to get
out of the rear door. if" was seated in the
middle of the car.
'â¢It seemed to me," said he, "that the
car simply opened up and let me down."
Lindoff says he caught tho trestle as he
went down and held on. His next recol
lection is that the wheels of the locomo
tive were coming toward him and almost
on top of him. For fear of being cut in
two he loosened his grasp and dropped
into the bay. He reached- a trestle and
thence climbed upon a cross plate and
hung on. Presently- a. boy came along In
a boat and he climbed in and was rowed 1
to where he could get on terra lirma.
Both Lindoff find Bull remember noth
ing that occurred '-after tHey got out of
the water, until .they came. to themselves
in the residence of Mrs. . Hunter, who
lives about a hundred yards from the
track n^ar -the scene -- of the accident.
They were .-wandering aimlessly about 1
the trestle when Mrs. Hunter found them
and took them to her home and dressed
their wounds. â â '...-â 
Gus Brown was standing on the rear
platform. After the crash he found him
self standing on his head inside the car.
He next fount* himself struggling in the
water.
w n.-n Motorman snarpe mmped from
the car he landed against a fence, and is
reported to have broken two ribs.
No official statement of the collision has
The railroad had the right
of wny. The motorman claims he en
d to make the customary stop,
but OWll - â  < â  wret rails and the fail
ure of the sand apparatus to w<>rk he
was unable to stop before reaching the
crossing. He did not hear the railroad
men sound any alarm, ring the btll nor
bIOW the whistle.
Tho railroad people Insist that they arc
not in any way to blame. The engineer
claimed he had every reason to .-xpi-ri
the elettri â  car to stop at a safe distance.
Tlk- railroad men claim the fact thut the
locomotive was brought to a stop within
less than a hundred feet of the crossing

FEDERAL PLACES
EXEMPTED FROM
CIVIL SERVICE
President McKinley's Order May
Cause Fear and Trembling
Among Many Employes.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, May 29.
The civil service ruder issued by the
President to-day exempting nearly 5000
Federal positions from the civil service
will be read with great interest in Cali
fornia, especially by those members of
: the Federal brigade who have only held
on to their Jobs because they were thus
protected. Politics and personal favorit
ism will cut some figure now, and many
of these' employes have good cause for
fear and trembling, it Is true the Presi
dent's order amending rule 2 of section 8
provides that "no removal shall be made
except for cause," but where there is a
will there is a way to get rid of undesir
able incumbents. It is maintained by the
' advocates of the civil service reform that
by this order President McKinley has
1 taken a long step backward toward the
spoils system. It Is claimed that the
competition system-on which the civil ser
i vice act and the civil service rules rest
has been seriously undermined.
| John K. Proctor, president of the Civil
I Service Commission, when asked this af
! ternoon as to the effects of the amend
; ments, said: "1 have had an opportunity
I only to give them a cursory examination.
â  Radical changes have been made which I
believe must work harm to the classified
service. The commission was not con
| suited about these changes and I prefer
! not to be interviewed until 1 have studied
them."

Rule 14 is amended so as to require
only non-competitive examinations lo test
the fitness of a person whom the head of
an executive department or the secre
tary of the Smithsonian Institution sh ill
nominate for appointment in the classi
fied service. This provision, it is declar
er], is meant to rover appointments to po
sitions requiring technical or scientific
training, and the Civil Service Commis
sion Is required to furnish a certificate
of qualification upon satisfying itself of
the general fitness and upon the receipt
of a certificate from the appointing offi
cer covering the facts. The amendment
provides against the transfer of persons
employed under this rule to places in the
competitive service.
The provision covering the removal of
persons in the classified service Is altered
materially In the language, and as chang
ed reads as follows:
No removal shall be made from the com
petitive classified service except for just cause
and for reasons given in writing, and the per
son sought to be removed shall have notice
Hnd be furnished a copy of such reasons and be
allowed a reasonable time for personally
answering the same In writing. Copy of surh
reasons, notice and answer, and of the order
of removal shall be made a part of the records
of the proper department or office, and the
reasons for any change in compensation within
the competitive classified service shall also be
made a part of the record of the proper de
partment or office.
Rule 7 of the act is amended so as to
give persons honorably discharged from
service in the army or navy of the United
States in the Spanish-American War, as
â well as the veterans in the Civil War.
preference in the making of appoint
ments. The term of eligibility, hereafter
one year from the date of entry of the
name of eligible candidates on the. civil
service commission's register, is extended
for a further period of one year in the
discretion of the commission.
The following new section added to rule
8 makes permanent in the discretion of
the heads of departments all existing
temporary appointments:
All persona serving under temporary ap
pointments at the date of the approval of this
section may he permanently appointed In the
discretion of the proper appointing officers, and
the special rule approved January 20, Ih9tÂ», rela
tive to temporary appointments In the Navy
Department is hereby rescinded.
Rule 9 is so amended as to exempt per
sons who served in the war with Spain
from the one year limit in the matter of
reinstatement after discharge from the
service. This provision also applies alike
to the widows of such soldiers, but the
former provision including nurses is
eliminated. Reinstatements generally
may be made hereafter without regard to
length of time where dismissal from the
service has been due to a reduction of
forces specifically required by law. Still
another provision made in this connection
Is as follows:
Any person dismissed from the service upon
charges of delinquency or misconduct may be
reinstated subjert to the other conditions of
these rules without regard to the one year
time limit of this rule upon the certified te of
the proper appointing officer that he has al
ready investigated the case and that the
charges upon which the dismissal was based
were not true.
An entirely new rule. No. 13, is added,
classifying all officers and employes In
the classified service as follows, unless
otherwise provided by law:
Class A, all persons receiving an annual sal
ary of less than $720 or compensation at a less
rate- B, from $720 to less than $840; C, JMO to
t'JOO; D, $900 to $1000; E. $1000 to $1200; F, ItfOU
to $1400; two, $1400 to $1600; three, $16U0 to |1700;
four, $1800 to $2000; five, $2'HO to $2500; six, all
at |2.->on or more.
This classification does not Include persons
appointed to an office with the advice and con
sent of the Senate or mere laborers or work
men; does include all persons designated as
laborers or workmen who, prior to May 6,
18S6. and on June 10, 1536, were regularly a*
i signed to the same grade of work as tUat ptr
formed by classified employes. Hereafter no
person appointed as a lal>orer or workman
without examination under the civil service
rules shall he assigned to work of the same
grade as that performed by classifled employes.
Rule 1, section 2, relating: to transfers,
is materially amended by striking out the ;
words "or if in said position there is not :
required, in the judgment of the com
mission, the performance of the same
class of work, or the practice of the same
mechanical trade- performed or practiced
in the position from which transfer is
proposed," and Inserting in place of them
the following: "But the provisions in re
lation to apportionment shall be waived
upon the certificate of the appointing of
ficer that the transfer is required in the
interests of good administration."
The members of the civil service com- !
mission, owing to he fact that they have
not had time to examine and study its
provisions in detail, are not yet prepared
to give out. a statement of the effect of ;
the order.' A comprehensive statement,
however, will be prepared pointing out its I
consequences.
According to figures printed in Doeom

SYLVA AS A TOOL
OF THE GAMBLERS
\>ausalito Trustee Gets
Himself Arrested.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, May 29.â Town Trustee
Adolph Sylva of Sausallto executed his
duly advertised star play to-day by hav
ing himself arrested on a felony charge
in ordÂ«r to settle the pool room question
as speedily as possible. Then the acute
official started in to celebrate his display
of genius, ending by causing a most dis
graceful scene in the Supervisors' cham
ber and narrowly avoiding a thrashing
at the hands of District Attorney Mc-
Isaac
The warrant for Sylva's arrest on a
charge of felony for having issued and
delivered a license to Joseph Harvey to
conduct a gambling game in defiance of
the statutes was sworn,, to by Eng-ene
Cramer* before Recorder SUnpton of
Sausalito. . The Trustee then came to this
city and petitioned the Superior Court
for a writ of habeas corpus, which was
granted by Judge Angellotti and made re
turnable on Monday, June 5. â  /J.'].;'
This afternoon Sylva suddenly walked
into the Supervisors' chamber, and with
out any apology rudely Interrupted the
routine of the session by declaring he
represented the majority of' the Town
Trustees of Sausalito In the capacity of
4 chairman and desired the board to adopt
a county license permitting pool rooms
to be conducted in that town. He was
ruled out of order by Chairman Barr and
I requested to take his seat, whereupon he
hurled an Invective at the head of Dis
trict Attorney Mclsaacj accusing the Jat
ter of having violated his pre-election
promises.
"Yau're drunk, Sylva," calmly replied
Mclsaac. "and when you're sober 1 may
condescend to talk to you."
At this Sylva loudly proclaimed that he
had eighteen warrants already sworn out
for the arrest of certain county officials
en felony charges and would have them
served if the Supreme Court lied favor
ably as regards the present Issue. Fol
lowing this with an epithet or two. he
was told to desist by the District Attor
ney or he would be made to suffer. Sylva
thi'ii dropped his air of bravado and
walked quietly from the room and took
a late train for a i usalito.

WANTS TO FIGHT SHARKEY
Jeffords, the Sonora Giant, Willing
to Meet the Sailor.
STOCKTON, May 29.â "Jim" Jeffords
wants to fight Sharkey. The big fellow
from the mountains is as splendid a speci
men of manhood as one cares to â . He
is built something on the plan of Sharkey.
He probably is a little taller and has a
slight advantage in reach over the sailor
boy.
"It" Bharkey will make the same propo
sition that he mad.' to Stelzner 1 will
fight him at any time. Shavkey offered
to take Ste-lzner on with an agreement to
stop him in ten rounds. I feel confident I
ran keep away from the sailor boy for
that long, anyway," declared the man
from Sonora.
"How about Btelzner?"
"Well. Stelzner won from me on a foul,
Jk had him all cut to pieces, and when he
c tiled me a vicious name I lost my head.
I picked him up and threw him to the
floor. Of course the referee had to decide
against me."
Jeffords and his trainer have gone to So
nora, but previous to their departure they
told all the local sports that Jeffords
would come to the scratch on the propo
sition at any time. He began his pugilistic
career in 1893 at Grass valley. He was
known through his prowess as wrestler
before he entered the ring. He holds the
championship of America for Cornish
wrestling. His boxing record includes I
about twenty fights, in several of which |
he exhibited science and endurance. It
Is the latter quality which would make
his friends sanguine if they could get him
Into a ring with the sailor.

INVALIDATES THE
SIDEWALK ACT
Judge Bennett Says It Is
Unconstitutional.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA. May 29.â Tn Judse Bur
â¢ - department of tht- Superior Court
Ision was handed down to-day In
the case of the Petaluma Paving Com
pany apainst James Singley declaring tho i
celebrated Vrooman Bldewalk act to he j
unconstitutional. The decision affects al
n-. st every city and town In the B
nearly .-ill of which have during the last
five years taken advantage of the act to
perfect street Improvements.
The action upon which the decision was
based was brought in the Superior Court
of this county to foreclose a lien for street
ssment. The case originated in pro
ngs taken by the City Council of i
Petaluma under what was supposed to be !
â¢ - il act of the Legislature 1 1 titled "An ;
act to provide for work upon streets,
alleys, courts, places and sidewalks,
etc.," Introduced Into the Senate In 1885
bj the late Senator Henry Vrooman of
Oakland. Some time ago the City Council
of Petaluma awarded the Petaluma Pav
ing Companj a contract to lay certain
sidewalks In that city in conformity with
th-- provisions nf the Vrooman ;*â¢â¢;. The
company carried out its contract and the
v. i.rk was accepted by t >i â¢ Council.
Singley refused to pay f..r his portion
of the work, and suit was brought to .
compel him to '!" bo. Judgment was u;vt-n
f. >r the plaintiff, atvl the defendant at
once moved for a new trial. To-day's
decision was thÂ»- outcome.
The main ground upon which the mo
tion for a new trial was based was that j
the act was unconstitutional and opposed
to the fourteenth amend] I I the
United States constitution, which pro
vides that "no State shall deprive any
person of life, liberty or property without
process of law"; also section 14 ar
] of the constitution of California,
which provides that "private property
shall not be taken or damaged for public
without just compensation having
first 1-' en made to or paid Into court f<>r
the owner." In handing down his de
cislon'the court says:
â â I have no doufct that the act of March
18. LBPS. --I, titled 'An act to provide for â¢
work upon streets, etc' to the extent that |
It seeks t" impose upon the property of
an Individual an assessment to pay the
c of a public Improvement, with
â .- regard to special benefit to said prop
erty and Independent of any judicial de
termination of such benefit, is void, and
cannot be made a basis for the mainte
â¢ m action like the case at bar."
In compliance with this reasoning a|
new trial in the case has been granted.

'IHE FUAN CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 30, 1899.
SOLID SEVER
WANT TO FAVOR
THE RACETRACK
Would Repeal the
Poolselling Order.
BLOCKED BY THE MINORITY
FUTILE EFFORT TO AVOID THE
VETO BY THE MAYOR.
City Will Buy the Land Required for
the Opening of Twenty-Fifth
Streetâ Other Busi
ness.
The "Solid Seven" of the Board of Su
pÂ« rvlsora made an attempt yesterday to
repeal the ordinance prohibiting the sale
of pools on racetracks in the city and
county of San Francisco, the operation I
of which resulted In the closing of the in
iquitous gambling resort known as In
gleside track. That tite attempt was not
immediately successful is due to the
watchfulness of the Mayor and the minor
ity members of the board.
During the intervals of the wrangle
that marked the attempt of the majority
to secure the .passage of the many rail
rcad franchises asked for by the Market
street Railway Company Supervisor
Black Introduced a resolution providing
foi the repeal of the racetrack ordinance.
H. Immediately moved its adoption. Su
pervisors Perrault, Lackmann, Deasy and
Bylngton entered objections to the pro
ceeding and wanted to know why the
members of the majority who had voted
for the passage of the ordinance now
wished to have it repealed.
Mayor Phelan ruled that the repeal of
the ordinance would have to be brought,
if at all, in the same way as it.s adoption
bad been effected by the board. The orig
ii a] resolution bad been passed to print
and at the following rtfeeting had been
acted on favorably by the board and had j
then gone to the Mayor for his approval, i
T< repeal the ordinance the same course j
would have to be pursued.
This was not what the solid seven
wanted. They knew that it' they buc
â  â¢ â  ded in passing the resolution of repeal
the manner Indicated the Mayor
would veto it when it was sent to him tor
his signature. For this reason they
sought t<> adopt th<- resolution as it was.
presented by Black and without having it i
go to >>rmt. The ruling of the Mayor!
killed this hope, however, and Supervisor
Perrault moved that the resolution be j
passed to print and referred to the Health j
and Police Committee. Before the full
significance of the motion had dawned
upon Black and his fellow members of
the majority, the Mayor asked If there
were anj objections, and bearing none de
clared the motion carried.
Tiiis was a body blow, but there was
no help for it and the majority were
forced, much against their will, t" take
their medicine. As the matter now stands
the resolution of repeal con If passed,
will have to go to the Mayor and he will
veto it.
The San Francisco Athletic club was
granted permission to hold a boxing exhi
bition on the evening of June ii.
An authorization was passed directing
the Mayor to purchase from the Carr es
tate certain property necessary for the j
opening of Twenty-fifth Street from San ,
Jose avenue to Guerrero street. The pur
. base price is fixed at $12,000.
A resolution was adopted appropriating
$1500 out of the insurance contribution
fund Tor the payment of extra help' in
the Fire Department from the evening of
July 3 to the morning of July 6.

ALCAZAR ACTORS
GRAPPLE WITH
SHAKESPEARE
Lewis Morrison in
"Hamlet."
SOUTHWELLS IN NEW OPERA
A WONDERFUL WHEELMAN AT
THE OBPHETJM.
Tivoli Revives "The Mascot" â Prize
Offered for the Best Title
to Kelcey's Nfew
Play.
New Hamlets are the vogue now, and
Lewis Morrison started the ball rolling
in the Alcazar last night before a nu
merous and good-natured audience. The
performance was full of hitches and
loss of memory on the part of the play
ers; the green calcium did not cover
Mr. Morrison in the ghost scene and he
muttered, "Turn the light on me," in
fiercely audible tones; the stage hands
made all sorts of unexpected noises be
hind the scenes and broke up several
big episodes; lines were cut and sand
wiched in at the wrong time, and sev
eral of the Alcazar actors were obvious
ly embarrassed by their Shakespearean
stride and wardrobe â but the audience
was good-natured, even respectful, and
received this new enterprise of the
stock company with constant attention
and frequent applause. "Hamlet" is a
guild play and hard to down.
Mr. Morrison comes to the Dane
rather late in life. I am told that he
has been studying the part for twenty
years. Well, he needs a few days more
before his interpretation is listed with
the big ones, but in the meantime his
Hamlet is quite a seeable old gentle
man, full of careful stage business and
good old-fashioned elocution. Miss
Florence Roberts is much to the good
in Ophelia. The unfortunate girl is
made musical, quite human and more
cheerful and plumper than we usually
get her. Clarence Mnntaine will be an
interesting Polonius after a little more
Intimacy with the lines, and Miss Fitz
allen is surprisingly convincing as the
queen. Frank Fanning plays Laertes
with almost comic <*pera enthusiasm,
and Howard Scott is a very tame ghost.
It is hard to take the production too
seriously, but only fair to say that it
will be running easier in a night or
two.
C'rarvd Opera-Hou-c
The first production In San Francisco
of "Princess Nicotine" was heard last
night in the Grand Opera House by a
row! audience, not only in point of num
bers but in Quality as well. The South
well Opera Company have put on the
opera in excellent style so far as scenery,
costumes, orchestra and chorus are con
cerned. In fact the most of the music
in the piece is choral, but what few little
solos there are are sweet and catchy.
The scene is laid in Cuba far enough ago
to warrant romantic Spanish costumes
for the men and fetching ones for the
women, as well as some pretty bits of j
scenery, but "the plot is the weakest part
of tbe production, being strung upon the i
slender thread of a roue, Don Pedro, and
his unwelcome attentions to the pretty
bride of Don Chicos, a wealthy young to
bacco merchant.
William Wolfe as Don Pedro. Thomas
H. Persse as Chicos, Edith Mason as
Rosa and Bertha Rlcci as the wife of
Don Pedro were the leading roles, and
gave satisfaction to an indulgent and
often pleased audience. Several pretty
bits of music, the cigarette song, the good
night and Don Pedro's silvery moon with
his allusion to Mayor Phelan were en
ored again and again.
Despite the poverty of the story and
many familiar strains in the music,
"Princess Nicotine " caught on last night
and the management was wreathed in j
smiles. The chief excellence of the op- i
eretta is in the concerted music, and
that was so good that it atoned for i
whatever shortcomings might have been
apparent. Miss Jeanette Fredericks
made her debut as Nita, the dancing girl,
and made a success in her turn in the
first act.
Orpheum.
While there are but two new acts on
the Orpheum bill this week they are of
the best, and either would do honor to
any vaudeville bill. We have had jugglers
and bicycle riders galore, but now comes
Henri French, who combines the two in
a way that gives one of the most Inter
esting and finished acts the Orpheum has
ever put on. No such trick bicycle rid
ing has been seen in this country as Mr.
French introduces at the finish of his act. ,
His juggling with the firebrand while
speeding around the stage on one wheel
is among the most thrilling finishes ever
seen in a vaudeville act in this city. The '
new comedy of the bill is left to Billy j
Clifford and ' Maude Huth. and while their
sketch is lacking in plot, this defect is
more than counterbalanced by the fine
touches of comedy evolved by Mr. Clif
ford as the Chappie and by Miss Huth
as the up-to-date young woman. The
balance of the bill is from last week,
though Billy Van appears in new stories
and jokes, "some of which he told when
here last year; but for the most part they
are new "and good. Moung Toon and
Moiing Chet are still big features. A spe
cial matinee will be given to-day.
JiVoM
The old favorite comic opera, "The
Mascot," by Edmund Audran, delighted
the patrons of the Tivoli last night. The
"gobble duet" and other numbers were
well rendered and had to be repeated.
Annie Meyers was Bettina, the Mascot;
Anna Lichter, Fiametta; Charlotte Beck
with. Prince Frederic; â¢Wiliam Pruette,
Pippo; Edwin Stevens, Prince Lorenzo;
Phil Branson, Rocco; William Schuster,
Mateo; Charles W. Swain, the Doctor,
and John P. Wilson, the Sergeant. Annie
Meyers made a sprightly Bettina and
Stevens was very funny as Lorenzo, be
ing ably supported by Phil Branson. Miss
Beckwith had an opportunity to display
her talents as a vocalist and made an ex
cellent impression. She introduced a
song, "In Days of Yore," which she sang
with rare feeling and expression and was
warmly encored.
Columbia
The second week of the Kelcey-Shannon
company presentation of "The Moth and
the Flame" opened at the Columbia last
night. There was a large and fashionable
audience, by which the play was thor
oughly appreciated. Next week an
original comedy in four acts by E. R.
Riggs will be presented. The new play
has "no name, and a prize of $100 is of
fered for the most appropriate title.

The four Silvinis are making a hit at

K> Chu â
William . â ": Dodson, â  a gentleman whose
voice ranges from the lowest bass to the
highest soprano, appeared as a . female
impersonator at the Chutes Free Thea
ter last night and scored a decided hit.
Little Maud Sorrensen changed her spe
cialty, and the rest of the bill was well
received by a large audience. This after
noon there will be a balloon ascension
by Emil Markeberg, and on Thursday
night the amateur minstrel performance
will be repeated.
OV ti n to Blanche Bates
WASHINGTON, May 29. â Blanche
Bates received a magnificent ovation to
night at the close of the third act of "The
Dancing Girl," given by Frawley's com
pany at the Columbia Theater. The au
dience tired itself out applauding Cali
fornia's brilliant young actress. The
curtain was rung up seven times and then
the lady retired behind the scenes, visibly
affected by the ardor of her reception.
Mr. Frawley was called upon for a
speech, and responded by modestly dis
claiming any credit for himself, but said
he was proud of having introduced Miss
Bates, who was a California girl and his
protege. "The Dancing Girl" as given
by the Frawley company to-night is de
clared by competent critics to be one of
the best performances offered here this
season, and superior to the Southern
company's rendition of this play.
CALL AGENT'S SUCCESS.
E. F. Hawkins of Salinas Finds His
Business Rapidly Increasing.
E. F. Hawkins of Salinas, who has for
many years looked after the interests of
The Call at that place, has been forced
to relinquish the agency, owing to his
increasing business interests, which de
mand his entire attention.
Mr. Hawkins is a young man who
might well be termed self-made. He has
worked his way from the bottom of the
ladder, and although he has met with
many reverses, his energy and close ap
plication to business have at last landed
him on the top, and to-day he is one of
the most popular and prosperous mer
chants of the city of Salinas.
SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS
TO RECEIVE SALARIES
A MEASURE OF ECONOMY TO BE
RECOMMENDED.
The Salary Committee of the Board of
Education met last evening and continued
to prepare a schedule of salaries of school
teachers for the ensuing year. The prin
cipal business of the session was the
alteration in compensation of the substi
tute teachers from payment per diem to
a monthly salary. By this action fhe
committee expects to practice economy
to the extent of about $5000 per year.
There are thirty-six day substitutes
and six night substitutes. Last year they
were taken from the salaried roll and
<some have been paid $3 50 per day for as
many days as they have rendered service
in tho schoolroom. Some of the teach
ers profited by this arrangement, but
many of them failed to earn the amount
of salary which existed under the old
regime. Recently a petition was circu
lated among them requesting the board
to re-establish the old system. It met
with some opposition on the part of the
more fortunate substitutes at first, but it
gained a majority of the signatures and
was taken before the committee last
night. In it it was pointed out that such
a change would mean a profit to the city
of $500 â¢ annually, and the committeemen
! passed upon the proposition favorably and
i will so report to the board next Wednes
| day night. Should the board adopt the
! recommendation the payment on salaries
j will commence July 1.
A request was made that the old salary
regime go into effect on the first day of
June, but the petitioners feared that it
might be extended until August 1. The
fact that it will be dated from the first of
an intermediate month is the result of a
compromise.
Some of the salaries of regular teachers
were raised last night, but the ax fell on
none of them. This was the result of an
' effort to equalize on some of the compen
sations which have been previously cut.

CAPTAIN NEALL
SENTENCED TO
BE DISMISSED
Court- Martial Found
Him Guilty.
PRESIDENT MAY INTERFERE
GENERAL SHAFTER'S URGENT
APPEAL FOR THE OFFICER.
John W. Mackay Has GonÂ« to Wash
ington to See McKinley and Ask
for a Pardon for Cap
tain Neall.
The court-martial which recently tried
Captain John M. Neall of the Fourth Cav
alry found him guilty of a sufficient num
ber of the charges preferred against him
to sentence him to be dismissed tha
service. A special to The Call last night
from Washington stated that the find
ings of the court had been received at
the office of the judge advocate general
of the army, and that the sentence wai
dismissal from the army. The case will
be laid before the President this week for
his action, but it Is not thought that he
will interfere.
The findings of the court-martial were
i forwarded to Washington last week by
| General Shafter. After the trial the find
; ings were laid before General Shafter by
i Judge Advocate Noble. Inasmuch as the
sentence of the court was dismissal, Gen-
I eral Shafter was powerless to act, tha
case being beyond his power. He, how
ever, submitted it to the judge advocate of
the department for an opinion, who re
| ported that there was no flaw to be found
!in the proceedings. General Shafter then
I forwarded the findings with the recom
i mendation for executive clemency. In
! fact, General Shafter made a most urg
| ent appeal for leniency' in the case. He
suggested, in view of the excellent record,
of Captain Neall in the past, his unques
tioned ability and th<r fact that his regi
ment was under orders to go to the Phil
ippines, where such- an officer would be of
the greatest benefit to the service, that
I the findings of the court be set aside and
| Captain Neall restored to duty.
i There is yet a chance for Captain Neall
to escape the sentence of the court, and
it is known that the strongest Influence
will be brought to bear upon the Presi
dent to-morrow by his friends for clem
ency in the case. John W. Mackay, tha
capitalist, who has all along been a friend
of Captain Neall's, and who has used his
I influence in his behalf, when he learned
that the findings of the court had been
forwarded to Washington, left immedi
ately for that city to see the President
|in behalf of the officer. When he went
! it was given out thac he was going to
New York, and only his most intimate
i friends knew of his destination. As Troop
I B, of which Neall is the captain, leaves
! in about ten days for the Philippines, tha
i action of the President will probably be
I made known the last of this week.
Neall's friends are of the opinion that
Mr. Mackay may be able to save him, and
they arf- anxiously awaiting the outcome
of his efforts.
Held Without Bail.
N. M. Larsen, who threw a cuspidor at
John C. Kenney in the Acme Lodging
iiouse on Market street, appeared before
Judge Mogan yesterday, and as the po
lice stated that Kenney might die tha
Judge ordered Larsen into custody with
out bail till the result of Kennev's inju
ries were known. George Ford, the sailor
who gave the old man. Martin Jackson, a
terrible beating Sunday morning at 904
Kearny street, also appeared before tha
Judge and his bail was Increased to $3000,
as Jackson's injuries are looked upon as
serious.

renditions in Cuba. After report > of these investiga
tions were befpre the country they were summed up
in both branches of our Congress, which
to make the sacrifice required by
:.n altruistic war.
In the House one s-peaker said: "The sturdy Cuban
are battling for that glorious birthright of
man, the greatest blessing known on earth, inde
rnment." Another said: "Let
to it that there shall be no more bloodshed
-:-t in the spirit of the highest patriotism in
: uration <>' the new republic of Cuba.' Sen
ator Cannon said: "Cuba has bought her freedom
with her blond."' Senator Mason said: "I will just
read a short extract from that distinguished scoundrel
with an itching palm, by the name of Christopher
Perez, as he wrote to Arangup n, be^eing him tn ac
â¢ bribes of Blanco and offering as a reason
the United States was lying low to steal the
island of Cuba. Says this distinguished scoundrel:
'No nation does favors without value received, and
if we allow ourselves to be protected it will be at the
our independence. We should not be de
ceived. The Yankees will absorb us. and this inde
pendence for which much blood lias been shed we
would be compelled to reconquer against a country
of 70.000.000 people." We will show to the world that
â  itement is false, that we are not seeking land,
that we are not seeking power. Rut in the close of
the nineteenth century the nations of the world will
see us as we do to Cuba what the Good Samaritan
did. bind up her wounds, feed her people and clothe
them; and the nations of the world will say at last, in
the beginning of the new century. 'There is one nation
king conquest, not seeking power, but one fol
lowing the Nazarene thai ha- learned the sublime
thousrht. bear ye one another's burdens.' "
Going hack to one year ago every reader knows
that Senator Mason ottered the sentiments of the
people of this country Tie voiced their purpose in
supporting the declaration of war. Rut a few months
â¢ne by since then and the imperialists and their
are publishing to the world that in all this we
were insincere, that it was all a pretense, that our
solicitude for the cause of humanity was assumed lor
the purpose of stealing Cuba!
If this i>e true, if the inconsistencies, the naggings,
the uses of arbitrary power in Cuba <>n our part, now
of daily occurrence, are in pursuance of a design held
from the beginning to take that island, we are amply
rig th< prophecy of Perez. We are deliberately
abandoning the part of the Good Samaritan and are
preparing to take our place with the thieves among
whom a certain man fell while journeying from Jeru
salem to Jericho, who robbed him and gave him the
wounds which the Samaritan soothed with wine and
oil.
As the solemn declarations made in Congress. last
year and the expressions of the President- message
r.re r. called we believe the people will return to th<
mood they were in last year, when they were ready to
spend and be spent for Cuban self government. We
cannot believe that Americans will ever take upon
them the shame of admitting that they delivered the
Cubans from the "deserved oppression" o-f Spain, not
c of our Christian love of humanity, but to
gratify our vulgar greed.

MEMORIAL DAY.
\A EMORIAL day is the expression of the im
/ \ perishable influence of patriotism under free
institutions and of the survival in the Ameri
can heart of those tender feelings which are among
the finest products of advanced civilization. The
form in which this mnniiestation of fraternal love for
the dead heroes of the republic is conveyed is ex
quisite in its conception and deeply suggestive in its
symbolism. That more than seventy millions of
I people should pause in the midst of their teeming
business activities, their political controversies, their
: mental competitions and their moral agitations, and
in gentle tranquillity, at home and abroad, distribute
I the benison of flowers over the ashes of the unfor
gotten warriors of their own blood who died that
their country might live, is a fact that transfuses
pessimism with the warmth and with the beauty of
j optimistic dreams.
The classical mold of this pathetic recognition of
! gratitude as among the first of human virtues is the
i artistic feature of the day. But the American soul
; thrills and glows with sentiments that were unknown
to the Greeks, and in the delicate stems, the quivering
leaves and the braided loveliness that profusely em
bellish the repositories of their treasured dust, reads
1 the symbols of individualized immortality. And as,
: over the whole length and breadth of our consecrated
land, the music of the human voice attests the un
dying national memory and translates the national
offering into breathing thoughts, expressed in touch
â  ing words, citizenship is rchaptized into the saving
i faith of unpolluted and regenerating Americanism.
Our dead soldiers have bound us to our national in
stitutions by every tie of principle and of honor. The
revolutionary martyr- were the apostles of the Declar
ation of Independence and of our federated Govern
ment The war of 1812 cemented our nationality upon
the land and upon the sea. The decisive struggle
with Mexico perfected the symmetry of the republic
! and secured to the world the future center of pro-
I gressive humanity. The Civil War removed our last
I constitutional inconsistency, clothed our political
i union with immortal colors and out of its transitory
I horrors evolved the extirpation of sectional discords
' and the completed unity of our diversified population.
| The war with Spain originated in a sentiment and will
' not end in a revolution. It has proved that there has
been no decadence in American manhood and has
taught the world the irresistible power of a Govern
; ment founded upon the sovereignty of man and stand
i ing for the exaltation of humanity.
Rightly interpreted. Memorial day is unique among
onal holidays. It is a warning to the effete des
potisms of the globe and an inspiration to ourselves.
Every man whose memory we celebrate was a free
citizen and not a subject or a mercenary. He had the
same inalienabh rights, the same inheritance of lib
erty, the same equality of opportunity that we possess
and enjoy. His dying eyes gazed upon the same
glorious flag that to-day spreads its stars and its
stripes in forty-five autonomous States, in our con- j
tinental territory, in the Antilles, in the Philippines, j
wherever an American vessel plows the deep or an
American uniform glitters upon the land. And. not
withstanding our temporary disturbances, that flag
has not been soiled by foul contact with despotism.
but represents alike the patriotism of the dead and of
the living and the unbroken continuity of our con
stitutional union, upon its ancient and its accepted
foundations.
IMPERIALISTIC TWINS.
TWO publications in the press of Friday last,
though referring to different incidents that trans
pired in localities seven thousand miles apart,
.-ire deeply significant of the imperialistic tendencies of
the day and of the practical effect they have already
produced upon our republican system of government
At Wardner, Edaho, a large number, of men claim
ing to belong to a miners' union destroyed property
and committed other acts of violence. The use of all
the power necessary to restore law and order and to
arrest persons who had been guilty of overt criminal
acts was promptly supported by the people and by the
reputable press of the United States. When, however,
martial law was unnecessarily declared by the Gov-.
ernor of Idaho hacked by a military force under Gen
eral Merriam, when a censorship over local news
papers was established and when, without color of
constitutional or legislative authority, the employ-
I ment of members of the miners' union was prohibited
i and, in individual cases of applications for work, a
military indorsement exacted, it was felt that even
Russia in its destruction of Finnish autonomy had ex
erted no more despotic authority and force.
Now it appears that the publication of the Mullan
Mirror, presumptively an organ of the miners, has
been suspended and its editor arrested on a charge of
sedition. It is very 'likely, that the paper has contained
indiscreet or even inflammatory articles, of the nature
and extent of which we have no information. But in
that locality the military power is dominant and suffi
cient to enforce tranquillity and the supremacy of the
law without the adoption of imperialistic methods.
Interference, therefore, with the liberty of the press,
for the abuse of which ample remedies exist through
the ordinary tribunals is a distinct evidence of the
growth of militarism and of its violent opposition to
constitutional safeguards for personal rights and for
individual liberty. When the Civil War was raging
the people would .not patientlyendure the assertion of
military authority in districts not within the lines of
actual hostilities, and Mr. Lincoln was most careful
' to insist upon the conservation of our fundamental
law as the vitalizing principle of the Union.
In a letter signed by one of the California volun
teers, well known. in San Francisco, and which is by
no means the fir-t of its kind, referring to the capture
of bolomen or raiding parties of mountain robbers on
Xegros Island, the writer says that the troops "turned
thr prisoners over to the native police, who, after
lining them up, filled the men with lead, making good
Filipinos of them."
It is altogether likely that this mode of speedily
transferring the natives of the Philippines to those
' blessed regions where terrestrial imperialism does not
exist, is justified by Spanish and also by Filipino pre
cedents. Among American citizens, however, who re
tain some faith in their Declaration of Independence
and in their national institutions, and who have an
actual comprehension of the meaning of the fraternity
of men under a divine sovereignty, the enfranchising
and civilizing virtues of assassination will be ques
tioned. Negros island is and has been under an
American administration, provisional in its nature.
There is no reason to doubt that the event described
in our quotation actually transpired. But it cannot be
believed that the unceremonious execution by the na
tive police, without even the rapid proceedirig of a
drumhead courtmartial, was sanctioned by the military
Governor of the island, who exercises civil functions,
or that it will fail to meet stern condemnation, prob
ably on the spot where it occurred, but certainly in
American communities, satisfied with their own re
j public and not ambitious to follow the imperialistic
I example of Great Britain.
No phrase has been more frequenutly repeated than
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAT 30, 1899.
that "eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." The
incidents upon which we have commented, one in an
American State and the other in a proposed American
dependency, suggest the necessity of rigid adherence
to the admonition and of effective resistance to every
departure from our political system, no matter under
what pretext it may be extenuated.
THE INCREASE OF IMMIGRATION.
SINCE the revival of prosperity following the en
actment of the present protective tariff the
United States have once more become attrac
tive to the unemployed of Europe, and as a conse
quence there has been so large an increase of im
migration as to reawaken in the East the popular de
mand for a more adequate restriction than now pre
vails.
The evil effects of unrestricted immigration upon
the labor market have long been felt throughout all
parts of the East north of the Ohio River. In some
industries, particularly in that of coal mining, the
lower grade of foreign labor has almost completely
supplanted American labor, and for years past vigor
ous efforts have been made to devise some means of
protecting the workingmen of the country from that
form of alien competition.
The problem is one which has been perplexing to
statesmen, and up to this time no adequate solution
of it has been found. It is conceded that an indis
criminate restriction is not desirable. The United
States owe much of their .prosperity to the sturdy im
migrants who have helped to clear its forests, build
up its cities and develop and advance its artistic in
dustries. On the other hand there has been a large
class of immigrants whose coming has been more
hurtful than beneficial to the republic. The point
at issue, therefore,' is to devise some means whereby
the good may be admitted and the evil rejected.
Something has been done in that direction already,
but it is not enough, as the present increase of im
migration shows.
There is, however, something more than the com
plexity of the problem that causes delay in Congress.
The great ocean steamship companies that ply be
tween the United States and Europe make a large
profit out of the hordes of immigrants that come into
the country, and it* is to their interest to have them
admitted with as few restrictions as possible. These
companies maintain a strong lobby at Washington,
and have had much to do with the delay of Congress
in passing either of the more stringent restriction
bills that have at various times been submitted to its
consideration.
The evil is more acutely felt in the more populous
States of the East than anywhere else. Very few
immigrants, even from Southern Europe, settle in the
Southern States, owing, doubtless to the presence
of the negroes. Most of them congregate in the big
cities and have reproduced there something like the
conditions which prevail in the slums of the great
I capitals of the Old World. That fact renders the
' evil of unrestricted immigration more pernicious than
I it would be otherwise and adds strength to the argu
ments of those who demand that something shall be
done at the coming session of Congress to impose
restrictions sufficient to protect our workingmen from
; a degrading competition and our cities from the men
j ace of what may become a dangerous mob.
THE CARRYING TRADE.
SOME time ago Sir Robert Giffen read before
the Royal Statistical Society an essay of the ex
cess of imports over exports in British trade of
recent years, which, owing to the eminence of the
author, attracted a good deal of attention. A full re
port of the paper, which was quite elaborate, has just
been received by the Treasury Bureau of Statistics at
Washington, and from a digest which has been given
out it appears to be almost as interesting to Americans
as to the British, for whom it was intended.
The paper, of course, deals with British trade, and
only incidentally refers to that of the United States.
One of the points of interest, however, is Sir Robert's
explanation of how Great Britain manages to carry
such a large excess of imports from this country over
what she exports to it. On that point the speaker
said:
."There are obvious reasons why the United States
should have an excess of exports. In the first place,
the United States has to pay in its exports for the
share of the- carriage of goods in its foreign trade
which is performed by foreign ships. This is
a very large figure. In recent years the propor
tion of the imports and exports of the United States
carried in foreign ships has ranged between 75 and
80 per cent. *o that the United States is a country
which has to pay other nations for the carriage of its
goods in the foreign trade. It may be mentioned, by
the way. that the foreign country which does the
carrying trade for the United States is mainly the
United Kingdom, and in this difference between the
two co-untries accordingly we have, pro tanto, an ex
planation of the excess of imports in the case of the
United Kingdom, and of the excess of exports in the
case of the United States."
. The United States has not had to wait for Sir Rob
ert Giffen to explain how great is the cost of leaving
the carrying trade to foreign nations. His words are,
therefore, of importance only because they give em
phasis to what has been so often stated in this country
by all who have given any study to the subject. The
payments which we make to Great Britain and to
Continental Europe constitute an immense drain upon
the profits we derive from our exports, and means
that much of a loss to our people.
There is but one remedy for the evil. If Congress
will provide legislation which will put American ships
on something like equal terms with the subsidized
merchant marine of the great nations of Europe, we
will soon carry our trade in our own vessels under our
own flag and save to our people the money they now
expend to pay for the service of foreign ships. Such
legislation has long been demanded and ought to be
provided at the coming session of Congress.
Rear Admiral Schley declares that it was worth all
the blond and money lost in the Spanish war to learn
our own power and to teach it to others. It may be
?n interesting coincidence that his imperial Majesty,
Emperor William,, asked solicitously the other day
after the health of "Fighting Bob" Evans.
Paderewski's newly wedded wife is said to possess
the remarkable faculty of looking beautiful and ugly
by turns. A lady so strangely endowed certainly
should have retained the ability of dropping one of
the turns or of warning an admirer when the other
was due.
Latest reports from Europe indicate that Dreyfus
is at last to leave Devils Island for a new trial in
France. If his dreadful prison has been rightly
named he ought to make it reasonably warm for those
of his accusers that still retain the pleasure of living.
Cyclones, tornadoes, thunder, lightning, hail and
rain are sweeping with devastating power through
death-laden districts of South Dakota, Nebraska,
lowa, Missouri and Michigan. And we are still
grumbling at the clerk of the Western weather.

General Merriam So
Reports to Shafter.
THE SITUATION AT WARDNER
SAYS THE LAWBREAKERS WERE
MOSTLY FOREIGNERS.
A Serious State of Affairs Prevails
Among the Miners, Who Are
in Dread of Their
Lives.
Brigadier General H. C. Merrlam. who
recently left Wardner, [daho, to return
to his rommanrt of the Department of
Colorado, arrived in the city yesterday
morning. He rame for the purpose of
making his report to General Shatter in
person. "Wardner is in General Shafter's
department, hut as General Merriam was
ordered there with troops drawn from
both departments, it was necessary for
him to report to General Shafter. The
two officers met at department headquar
ters ahout noon and were closeted for
over an hour. General Merriam when
seen refused to discuss the situation at
Wardner, except to say that military law
was still in operation there. He, how
ever, declared that he had been grossly
misrepresented by the press dispatches
that had been Font out as to what he
had said in connection with the Miners'
I'nion. He stated that what he did say
had been garbled and twisted so that his
true .statements had never been made
public.
General Merriam says the statement
that the miners are Americans is incor
rect: on the contrary the major portion
<~>f them are foreigners. He pays that he
was ordered to Wardner to do a certain
duty, and that he did it. and that he did I
not ustj any expressions deserving cen
sure.
"When I left," said he, "there were 330 i
prisoners still in confinement, but this
number is being reduced every day as ]
the investigation being conducted by the j
civil authorities progresses and non
! participants In the late trouble are al
| lowed to go.
"On the surface everything was quiet
i and apparently good feeling reigned
I again, although at the bottom T know
the old feeling is smoldering and only
: force of arms prevents it breaking out.
The prisoners are not military pris
oners, but were taken by the civil au
thorities. The military went in to the
district simply to maintain the ppace and
make it possible for thr> civil authorities
to make their arrests without the proba
bility of bring molestfd or murdered
while they wore doing it."
As to the reason for his short stay in '
this city. General Merriam said: "The
Ooeur d'Alene is in the Department of
the <'olumb'a and consequently under
General Shafter's command. I really
have nothing to do with it. I have come
to this city to turn the command over
to General Shafter and acquaint him with
the conditions he will have to mept. As
to those conditions or the probable out
come of the whole affair I am not at lib
erty to speak."
CHILDREN ALLOWED

Judge Groezinger Object to
a Discriminatory Law.
The crusade of the California Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
against proprietors of places of amuse
ment for allowing children to sing and
fiance has met with an inglorious end, at
-UOD 9JB SaOTJld 941 JO oa\i SB JBJ SB }Sl?e[
cerned.
John Morfisey, manager of the Or
pheum. and Mrs. Lund were charged in
Acting Police Judge Groezinger's court
yesterday with permitting La Petite
Lund to perform on the Orpheum stage.
Attorney Ackerman appeared for the de.
fendants and pointed out that a child;
could sing and dance for a church fes
tival but could not sing and dance for her
parents' benefit, which showed that the
law was discriminatory and. unconstitu
tional. He contended that It must be
shown by the prosecution that the sing
ing and dancing by the child was In
jurious to her physical condition.
Officer M (Murray, who is attached to
the society, testified that ho could not
say if the child's physical condition was
injured by singing and dancing, and
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter was put
on the stand and asked", "Is there any
difference in the physical condition of a
child Kinging and dancing at a church fes
tival and singing and dancing at the Or
pheum?" He promptly replied, "I cannot
say."
After the defendant Morrisey testified
In answer to the same question that the
only difference, was the child was paid
at the Orpheum, the Judge dismissed the
case.
In Judge Graham's court Mrs. Addle
Sorenson was charged with allowing her
daughter, Maud, to sing and dance at
the Chutes, and the Judge dismissed the
case.
The Tlvoli cases In connection with the
boy. Arnold Glazer, and the girl, Hester
Callihan. were called in Judge Mogan's
court, but were continued until Thursday
by consent. The decision will no doubt be
I the same as In the other cases.

REGENTS DECIDE HOW CHECKS
SHALL BE SIGNED.
Martin Kellogg Re-elected ' President
of the University for a Term
Ending June 30 Next.
The Board of Repents at a ppf>rj ;i l meet
ing yesterday forenoon re-elected Martin
Kellogg president of the State Univer
sity for a term ending June 30 next. May
15 was the end of the academic year, and
at that time the resignation of the presi
dent took effect. As the president of the
Board of Regents, Governor Gage, was
not in the city, and as the university had
no president, the regents could find no
one with authority to sign checks; hence
it was tedded to temporarily fill the va
cancy in the office of president of the uni
versity.
Formerly it was the custom of the
Governor of California to sign all de
mands on the treasurer of the university
but there was a departure from this or
! der of things during the administration
of Governor Budd. On account of sick
ness he was compelled to remain away
from the city for several weeks, and dur
ing his absence chicks were signed by
President Kellogg. Lawyers on the board
doubted whether the Governor or the re
gents had any right to deli crate the power
to the president to sign demands on the
treasury, but the business men of the
i board saw nothing amiss in the transac
tion. Regents Wallace and Foote now
maintain that the power to sign checks
is the prerogative of Governor Gage, and
that the regents cannot lawfully vest the
president of the university -with that au
thority.
It was resolved at the meeting yesteroay
that the president of the board. Governor
Gage, should be asked to sign the checks
The checks for payment of salaries ana
the other expenses of the institution at
Berkeley are not drawn directly on the
Treasurer of the State of California. The
money is drawn from the State in large
installments and transferred to Louis
Sloss treasurer of the university. The
checks under discussion at the meeting
yesterday are those authorizing Louis
Sloss to "pay out money belonging to the
university. ..
About two years ago the regents paid
a lawyer of this city $2400 for lobbying at
Sacramento. In a clerical capacity Gov
ernor Budd signed the check, which was
paid by the treasurer of the university.
The transaction did not come under the
observation of the State Board of Exam
iners or the State Controller.
The regents yesterday fixed the salary
of President Kellogg at $500 a month.
I.ids for the construction of the uil
merdlng School building will be opened
at Berkeley next Friday at noon.
The indications are that the regents, at
the next regular meeting of the hoard,
will elect Dr. Wheeler of Cornell College
president of the university to succeed
Martin Kellogg.
PENNSYLVANIA WANTS
CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS
AGENT OF THE PHILADELPHIA
EXPOSITION HERE.
Seeking Exhibits From the Fruit
Growers and Wine Makers
of the State.
An effort is being made to have Cali
fornia well represented at the exposition
to be given in Philadelphia next Septem
ber. The exposition is known as the Na
tional Export Exposition and it will be
given under the auspices of the Philadel
phia Commercial Museum and the Frank
lin Institute. The object is to show as
complete and comprehensive a list as pos
sible of the exports of the United States,
and it is desired that the products of this
State be particularly well represented.
The exposition management has sent a
representative to California and for the
next month he will aecure material for a
creditable Californian exhibit. Their rep
resentative is J. M. Slauffer of Philadel
phia, who for many years has dealt in
California fruits in the Eastern markets.
Mr. Stauffer has made himself known to
the Chamber of Commerce and the State
Board of Trade and has secured the in
dorsement and the co-operation of those
berlles. He is prepared to sign contracts
for space in the exposition buildings and
to make all arrangements with intending
exhibitors.
"Our exposition," he said yesterday.
"has received the sanction of the Wash
ington Government to the extent of an
appropriation of $350,000; the State of
Pennsylvania has subscribed 1200.000 more
I and the city of Philadelphia about $250.
--] or>oâ in all a total of about JSOO.OOO. We
j will open an exposition that will attract
people from all over the world and we are
very anxious that California's food prod- :
ucts should be a conspicuous feature. :
There has been set aside a large section
of thp principal building for expected Cali
fornia exhibits and we are sure it will be
i filled. I will remain here in San Fran
! Cisco for two or three weeks and then
I will go to San Jose. Fresno and Los
Angeles. By that time I expect to have
completed satisfactory arrangements and
I will return.
"Space is to be had for $1 a square
foot, no single allotment to be less than
five by ten feet or fifty square feet. The
exposition will furnish light and heat and
the services of janitors. There is not j
much time left for intending exhibitors to :
secure space unless they Immediately be- â 
gin the work of preparation. It will be.
necessary for all shipments to be ready j
by the first week in August, leaving a lit
tle over a month for them to reach Phil
adelphia and be put in place.
"What we particularly want is a fine
display of fresh and dried fruits. Such
an exhibit would be of immense value to
the State, and its effect on the dried fruit
trade would be seen ;it once."
In connection with this dried fruit ex
hibit it has been suggested that a plan,
tried with the most gratifying success in
the Hamburg exposition, be tried in Phil
adelphia. This was to have a practical
demonstration of the value of dried fruits
by preparing them for the table before the
spectators and then to serve 'he palatable
dish to whoever desired to sample it.
California wines are also wanted by the
exposition and California canned fruits.
Mr. Stauffer will communicate with the
growers, wine makers and canners, call- j
ing their attention to the exposition and
ir. forming them of the chance to secure
space. He has made his headquarters
at the Runs House, where he will be dur
ing his stay in this city.
The exposition will open September 14
and remain open for three months.

Editor Call: The article recently pub
lish.' 1 , in your paper entitled "Our One
\\Y;tk Spot," in reference to the judiciary,
is, in the opinion of the writer, an under
estimate. The truth. is. there are several
others in our political system in addition
to the above, namely, abject submission
to boss rule and the vitiated state of af
fairs which permits and perpetuates the
same: political parasites who fatten off
the public crib and what they purloin:
wis. in our own conceits, in a political
B< use: absurd ideas regarding our stand
ard of civilization; slipshod methods in
municipal affairs; and the apparent re
luctance to improve them by patterning
nfter other well-regulated communities;
the defiance of law and authority by the
irrepressible, inseparable . and fiendish
mob; the existence of a hungry and un
scrupulous army of office-seekers; the
utration of capital and formation of
gigantic trusts for the benefit of the few
to the injury of the many and the power
of the "pull and the "push," etc.
That we are a great nation, however,
must be admitted, even with these de
fectsâgreat in territory, great in re
sources, great in power, but with a great
deal yet to learn. P. MOORE.
THE VALLEJO WHARF.
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: I notice
In Siyiday's Call an item stating that
Judge P.r.ckles had decided in favor of
the city of Vallejo In the suit brought
against it by the Vallejo Ferry Company
to enjoin the city from letting a contract
to construct a wharf. Your correspond
ent is mistaken. The Judge decided In
favor of the Ferry Company. In his opin
ion, which I have before me. he holds the
wharf as proposed will interfere with the
ferry, and enjoins the city from construct
ing it as planned, or any wharf project
ing south of a certain line, which line is
135 feet north of the proposed wharf In
short, he holds that the city cannot build
a wharf to interfere with the ferry The
general right of the city to construct a
wharf at the foot of Virginia street was
not involved in the case or decided by
the Judge. It is involved in another case
now pending In that court, but that case
has not yet been decided. Very respect
fully, F. W. HALL.
Attorney for Vallejo Ferry Company.

A DANGEROUS
COUNTERFEIT
IN CIRCULATION
Most Perfect Coin o1
Its Kind.
EVEN EXPERTS ARE DECEIVED
MEXICAN DOLLARS ARE BEING
TRANSFORMED.
I Banks Are the Chief Sufferersâ Coun
try Is Flooded With Large
Quantities of the Bogus
Money.
The most dangerous counterfeit p.-pj
put nn the money m both
| ering the â -â¢ y
j months and they tacitly confess I
; selves powerli ss to fen
j who produce thf coin. It is that
dollar and has i : â  b â¢â  i
hanking circles as the "count*
can." It is not a bogus M xi
can dollar, but the term
fles that a good Mexican
has been transformed into an Ami
dollar by some process unknown
to the counterfeiters, and h.i -
so perfectly as to deceive even th.
expert.
The banks are becoming alarmed at thÂ«
great quantities of the- bogus coins
i pass through their channels. They have
| awakened to the realization of tj
[ that the country Is simply flooded
the dangerous counterfeit and are I
opinion that some decided stops
[ be taken by the United Steates au
j ties to discover the guilty parties.
The bogus coin has the true rin
correct weight, hut a (dose inspectioi
< closes a few slight Imperfections hard
! visible to the naked eye. They bear t),
â  years lfcRS. IK<H. 1898 and 1899 in "figures not
ias broad as the genuine. The wreat!
i around the eagle is somewhat broken and
j the nose on the head of Liberty.is not as
I sharply defined. Again, the coin is not
j perfectly centeredâ that is. the eagle and
i the head pn the reverse Bide are out ol
i plumb. But all these imperfections can
| not be noted without the use of a micro,
scope. The color might be said to t..
\ slightly "off." but not more so than many
of the genuine coins.
Cashier Thomas Burns states that the
coins have been coming into the Sub-
Treasury for nearly a year past. Every
day the counterfeits are received and
turned over to Secret Service Agent
Browne. The latter refused to talk aBo til
the subject and manifested entire igno
rance when asked about it.
It Is a fact, however, that enormous
quantities of the coins are in circulation
and that the United States Government
does not recognize the fact of their hems
mrfde of the pure metal. That they ar>
not minted legitimately is sufficient cause
for their confiscation and destruction.

Colon Carried a Lot of Yellow Men
to Fill the Place of Strikers
at Panama â Water Front
Notes.
A fleet of steamers made port Sunday j
Bight and yesterday. The China, Tai Fu, |
and Carmarthenshire arrived from the '
Orient, the City of Sydney from Panama j
end way ports, â¢id the Curacao from j
dean ports. All of them brought j
heavy cargoes and some of them were j
crowded with passengers, so the quaran
tine authorities and Custom-house offi
cers had a busy day of it.
The China got In Sunday night, but it
"was nearly 3 p. m. yesterday before she
landed her cabin passengers. The delay
Nvas caused by the Chinese in the steer-,
nge. The. quarantine officer was through
with the vessel at 7 a. m. and then the
Xvork of sending 300 Chinese to the Angel
Island quarantine station began. This ,
"was accomplished in about three hours, j
finil by 11 a. m. the China was anchored
off the Mail dock.
While the China was landing the Chi
nese the City of Sydney came .in from'
Panama, and being passed by the quar- |
Untine officer went direct to the Mail dock j
and took the China's berth, the Colon be
ing In the Sydney's berth. The latter yes- !
sel was to sail it noon, and as soon as she |
went out the Sydney was to haul ahead
find make room for the China.
The China had on board 150 Chinese In
transit for Panama and these had to be
Transferred to the Col'in. The latter, there
fore, remained at the' wharf while the
CUcmpols were brought from the China on
the tug Millen Griffith and put -aboard.
'There were 100 cabin and OS second cabin
passengers on the China and the language
they used in speaking of Pacific Mail
management while watching the transfer
of the coolies would not look well in
print. About 3 p. m. the Colon sailed, the
City of Sydney pulled up into the vacated
ben . and the China docked.
The City of Sydney brought a very
heavy cargo of general merchandise, su-
Kar and coffee from Panama and Central
American ports. Among the cabin pas-
Bengers was H. Gllette, the Southern Pa
cific's chief assistant engineer. He has
been all over the Central Guatemalan
Railroad and Is pared to make a re
port on the same to C. P. Huntingdon.
The Carmarthenshire also had trouble
v. It her Chines* passengers. She has
considerable cargo f.^r; San Diego, and
â¢ofter discharging here will sail for that
port She has four Chinese for San Fran
cisco and these the customs authorities
â will not land until their cases ha been |
investigated. The steamer cannot wait i
for them, so in order to straighten things |
out a house had to be built on Lombard-
Btreet wharf for them. There they will
live under guard until their right to land i
la settled.
Th<' Colon took away 237 Chinese all told
for Panama. There nave been two very
f-xpenslve strikes among the freight han
dlers on the isthmus and the Mail Com
pany does not propose to have another
one. When the Colon arrives th.- men
â who have returned to work will get a j
very disagreeable surprise, as they will
1Â»- "lire<l bodily" and the Chinese put in
their places.
Among the cabin passengers of the
Colon was A. G. Canalizo of the firm of
l.<-miza <t Co. He will visit his friends
jind relatives in M izatlan and on his j
leturn will ring his '..ride with him.
The United States Mansport Grant will
not sail for Manila until this afternoon.
The men of the Sixteenth Infantry have
riot been paid for two months and Uncle
Sam is going to fulfill that obligation be
fore the men leave for Manila. Early this
rrornfng the. work 'if paying will begin
and about 2 p. m. the big transport will
get under way.

WRECK OF THE STAREUCK.
Inspectors Find That She Struck on
an Uncharted Rock Off Central
American Coast.
Captains Boles and Bulger, Govern
ment Inspectors of Steam Vessels, held
an Inquiry yesterday Into the cause of the
wreck of the steamer Starbuck off the
coast of Central America about two
months ago, the Investigation bavins;
been delayed awaiting the arrival of the
captain. The vessel belonged to the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company and struck
on an uncharted rock off Coseguina Point,
near Corinto. The deck cargo was jetti
soned and the passengers were safaly
landed, there being no casualties. Cap
tain C. J. Brugulere testified yesterday
that he was on the bridge and saw no
breakers or other Indications of rocks or
shoals.
It appeared 'that there had been a very
severe earthquake a short time before
the vessel struck, and it was the opinion
of old tars who had sailed the tropic seas
for many years that the rock was thrown
up by the earthquake. '
The inspectors will render a decision
when they shall have learned from the
Pacific Mall Steamship Company the
value of the vessel and her cargo. She
had been used to ply between Acapulco
and Panama,

Emma Ducas, n Confirmed Klepto
maniac, in Jail.
Emma Duoas, who the police say is a
confirmed kleptomaniac, was arrested
yesterday by Detective Anthony and
charged with grand larceny. Some time
ago the woman procured employment as
a servant in the family of Mrs. Cohn at
Hi*) Golden Gate avenue. During the tem
porary absence of the family* it is claimed

stracted three valuable diamond rings, tha
property of Mrs. Cohn.
When' accused of having purloined the
rings she vigorously proclaimed her in
nocence and was at once discharged. De
tective Anthony after investigating be

had stolen the jewelry and he started
out to find her.
Yest< rdaj he found her in a lodging
house on Fifth street, near Minna. Be
creted under the mattress of her bed w< re
two of the Btolen rings. On being con
fronted with the evidence of her guilt the
woman broke down and made a complete
confession. She claimed that a steam
ship fireman, whose name the police re
fuse to divulge, influenced her to rob her
employer.
The records of the Police Department
show that the woman was arrested ab iul
three years ago for grand larceny, but
escaped with a sentence of six months.
Detectiv* Anthony recognized her from

REV X.ERR, BOYCE TOPPER.
AMONG the distinguished ministers who have been in this city during
the past week in attendance on the Baptist anniversaries is the Rev.
K< rr Boyce Tupper, n.l>.. LL..D., pastor of the .First Baptist Church
of Philadelphia. He enjoys the distinction of being the tenth pastor tin
church has had in the past IT" years. The church i.- said to be th>
third oldest Raptist In America, it having a short time since cele
brated Its two hundredth birthday.
Ti-,.' Firs! Baptist Church over which Dr. Tiipper presides has 1083 mem
\Â« r- and ha? $2r>fuÂ»*' in Its treasury. The Interest on half 'hat amount is de
voted to the Boys' and Girls' Guilds in connection with the church and city
missions. One hundred and ten thousand dollars is endowed far rlâ  â¢ â¢ us.- of
the poor and the officers of the church are busily engaged caring for the un
fortunate.
The chur>h now occupies a handsome edifice on the northwest corner of
Broad and Spruce streets, but will within the year move into a magnificent
BtXUCture on the. east side of Seventeenth street, midway between <'h. â st
unt and Walnut streets. Of the 1(K) I'.apiist churches in the city of Phila
delphia the First Baptist Church, in the center of the city, embraces a dis
trict whose population is 2OO,oe<V After paying about $iv,.<kki for the property,
which is at present occupied by Borne twenty small houses, and %w.<Â»>Â« for
the new building, the church will put aside $150,000 for -an endowment fund.
Or Tupper read an Interesting paper on Saturday last at the fourth ses
sion of the American Baptist Publication Society on "The American Baptist
Historical Society." yesterday he occupied the pulpit in a leading church
a CroBB the bay, and last evening delivered an elooueni sermon at the First
Presbyterian Church. The doctor has won many friends since his sojourn
in this city He i^ a man of pleasing presence, a brilliant conversationalist
and a student. He is staying at the Occidental.

i* a fretful indiÃr-OFition manifested when it is
proposed to discuss the science of economics in
the kingdom of Jorus Christ.
I)oOnot underestimate the magnitude of the
work It i. one religion daring to challenge all
the others, denying their authority *nd antag-
I onizing their most Inveterate prejudices. The
atmosphere of heathendom is filled with the
traditions, vices, superstitions which agitated
and divided former generations, but now blend
and demonstrate their influences against the |
triumph of Christianity. The nobility of the .
cause and the enormous impediments in the |
way of success justify prompt and liberal In
vestments. Yet while millions are unhesitat
ingly lavished on shares In trusts, but meager
offerings .are received for a movement which
comprehends in its triumph the civilization of
all lands. The American Almanac of Missions,
189 S. reports the donations of Christian churches
in Great Britain and Ireland and in the United
States as reaching the poor figure of $13,988,887.
This authority concedes that the foreign field j
has large Interests In money given to various
societies, as .the. Tract and Bible societies
reaching probably $2,000,000 more. But even
uniting these sums we have not an expenditure
commensurate with the vastness and signifi
cance of the enterprise.
Tin- carefully prepared statistics of A. H.
Nelson of Chicago give us the following
data for the United States. He places the
membership of the Protestant churches in this :
country at 17,796,748, the Roman Catholic num- ,
bering 8,410,592. These Protestants gave the
foreign missions in 1897 $3.504,156. But if you j
are prepared to congratulate yourself, consider !
some figures on the other side compiled by Dr.
Strong, author of "Our Country." He says
that if Christians gave only 1 cent on the
dollar of the real and personal property, their I
contribution would be $87,254,000; and If they i
would each give 1 cent a day their books would
show a 'total of $38,500,000. Ah it Is the total
offering for religion In the United States is ]
merely $150,000,000 per annum, while our offer- j
ing of less than $4,00,000 for the extension of I
the kingdom sounds ridiculously small by the \
Bide of "$25,000,000 put to the account of chew- j
Ing gum. It is computed that we spend $400,- ]
COO.OOO for amusements and $523,000,000 on tobac
co and the bewildering total of $1,200,000,000 on
intoxicants, not including the taxation Imposed
on the community by crime, prisons and the I
â of productive capital occasioned by this j
terrible curse. If you will subtract from the
sums spent on amusements, tobacco and even ;
wine, the sums spent by professing Christians j
on these objects, you will have a total Infinite
ly transcending what they donate to foreign
missions, and more than likely fully equaling
the $150,000,000 set apart by them each year
for the maintenance of Christianity in the
United States.
BUSINESS OF THE
CONVENTION
Missionary enterprises In foreign coun
tries were considered at the morning
, si-sKimi of the American Baptist Mission
ary Union yesterday. The meeting was
an auspicious one, as it marked the
eighty-fifth anniversary of the organisa
tion. Hon. Robert <>. Fuller of Cam
bridge, Mass., as president of the union,
presided over the meeting, and Rev. Dr.
Poteat of Philadelphia acted as secretary.
President Fuller opened the initial
session of the organization with his an
nual address, in the course of which he
paid a tribute to the late Rev. Samuel
W. Duncan of Brookline, .Mass. He eulo
gized tiir foreign secretary for the grand
work he bad performed for the mission
ary cause. He also told of a visit to this
coast main- years ago of a party com-
I posed of members of the Boston Hoard
of Trade and of the royal welcome they
received. "We were then," he said, "as
wr are now -very hospitably entertained.
One interesting ceremony was at the (.'lift
House, the mingling of a bottle of water
from tin' Atlantic Ocean with that of
the Pacific Ocean. That was a symbol
of the union of the East and West. In a
like manner this is a union ot' the Bast
and West."
The speaker then discussed the reasons
why missionaries were sent to foreign
countries when there was plenty Of good
to be done at home. He stated that their
prdere were to go into all parts ot' th<
world and preach the gospel to every
creature, fie cited many instances where
good had resulted from the work of mis
sionaries. He said: "!f missionaries had
never gone to the Hawaiian Islands,
eight) years ago some European power
would have had them and you would have
had a hostile nation at your doors. \W
are indebted to the missionaries sent out
there eighty years ago for your Hag wav
ing over those Islands to-day." in con
cluding, he said the great question of to
day ! < one of finance. The executive corri
niitt"e needs aid in currying on the work
Rev. 11. C. Mable of Boston, the home.
secretary, followed and read a lengthy re
port of the executive committee, which
reviewed the work accomplished during
thi past year. The r. port also contained
a good deal of information on the BCOpe
of the missionary cause.
At the conclusion of the report. Rev
Dr. Fish of Wisconsin led the assemblage
in prayer. E. P. Coleman, treasurer of
the union, read a report, In which he gave
an Itemized statement of the financial
condition of the union.
At the 'afternoon session Rev. L. S.
Bowennan of Washington led the devo
tional exercises. Aft.^r the singing of the
Coronation Hymn Hon. Robert O. Fuller
delivered a short address? on the purpose
ot the meeting and introduced Rev. I. s.
Barton, who led in orayer.
Rev. Ola Hanson, a mlssloary just re
turned from Burmah, told of his work
and experiences among the heathens and
followed by Rev. F. P. Haggard, for
merly pastor in an lowa church, but who
baa been doing pood work among the
tribes around Assam. He proved a forct
ble Bpeaker ;ind was listened to with deep
Interest. He appealed for throe more men
and asked that tiny be sent to that dis
tant land to aid "!n christfanflng the
heathen. He also told of the difficulties
it. getting to his district and created mer
riment. His constant recurrence to the
fact that three missionaries were needed
in the Assam district aroused hearty ap
plause. He was followed l>y Rev. R. K.
Williams who told <it his services in In
dia. The latter delivered a pathetic
Bpeecn and moved some of his listeners to
tears. He said that although he was
broken down from long and hard service
in a foreign field he would continue to
preacb the Gospel with all his power. Rev.
Alfnd Fuller, son of the president of the,
union, was introduced by Dr. Mabte. The
vniiiK missionary proved a witty talker
and kept his auditors in a constant state
of merriment. He gave his experiences
among the Telugus. He said he came
primed for a two and a half hours' talk,
but was told he could only speak fifteen
minutes. During that short period' he
dwelt on the good work done by the mis
sionaries and also touched on theological
subjects.
In the absence of Rev. W. H. P.
Faunce, D.D., pastor of the Fifth
Avenue Baptist Church, Washington,
N. W.. Rev. H. M. King. D.D..
of Providence, R. L, delivered the
address. His subject was "The Call of
God's Providence to an Increased Activity
in Christian Missions." He delivered an
eloquent talk and waa applauded fre
qi.ently for his views. A. D. Michael of
Spangle. Wash., a colporteur of the publi
catlon society, told "now John B. Gougli
was converted.

NEW GAME PLAYED
WITH BILLIARD BALLS
Confidence Men Substitute Old Ivor
ies for New Ones â Police Search
ing for Two Clever Rascals.
For the past three months the Police
Department has been searching for two
stylishly dressed individuals who are
causing no end of trouble to the keepers
of billiard narlors and proprietors of ho
tels by substituting old ivories for the
glistening balls that are wont to chase
each "ther around the cushions. Reports
have been frequent, but the smooth in
divtduala have thus far escaped the \
clutches of the law.
Last night another report was added to
the long list already on lHe in the <'hief
df Police's office, it was lodged tbere by
the proprietor of the Miramar Hotel. 70' i \
Geary street. It seems that early in the
afternoon the thieves entered the billiard !
room of the hotel and engaged in th/i
game. They claimed to he Eastern com
mercial men. and as they showed every
evidence of being gentlemen they wera
permitted to play. They returned again !
at night and engaged in a game, and
shortly after they left the hotel the, i
keeper of the game discovered that some
very old l>al!s had been substituted for â 
the set that belonged to the table. The
alarm was given and a number of those
employed about the hotel rushed out In
the hope of overtaking th^ Bmooth scoun
drels, but without success. The matter
was then reported to the police and every
effort will fate made to catch the bold fel
lows.

The Issue Will Be Forced by the

Tlif minority In the Bnard of Super
vising wmi another victory yesterday
when they again succeeded In postpon
ing (inal authorization for the payment of
the bills of the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company for lighting the streets
and public buildings for the months of
December, Jarluary, February and March.
Attorney Bishop, representing the gas
company, appeared before the board and
made a plea for the passage of the bills.
He said that the dilatory motions of thÂ«
minority, which were sustained by the
rulings of the Mayor, were contrary to
parliamentary usage and contrary to law.
He intimated that such action was actu
ated by motives that may be considered
questionable, and said that all that was
asked of the board was some definite ac
tion one way or the other, so that tin
corporation may have the opportunity of
urging the justice of Its claims before a
court of law.
This appeal had no effect on those mem
bers of the board who are contending f" r
the city's rights, and who claim that the
k;is company should be forced t<v make a
reasonable rate for pas furnished the city
;is well as to consumers. At the last
meeting of the board, when the author
izations came up for final passage. Super
visor Byington moved to amend by mak
ing the rate for gas $110 instead of $1 sn.
and also by reducing the rate charged
for electric light by 25 per cent. This
amendment was voted down and Super
visor Perrault gave notice of a motion
to reconsider the vote by which the
amendment was lost. Yesterday when the
motion to reconsider came up it was lost
by a vote of seven to five. The question
was then on the final passage of the
authorizations, and Perrault moved to
amend by fixing the rate to be paid for
gas at $1 08 and to reduce the rate to be
paid for electric light 23 per cent. The
amendment was lost by the following
vote:
Ayesâ Byington. Deasy. Heyer. Lack
ma nn and Perraultâ 6.
Noes â Aigeltinger, Attridge, Black, Col
lins. Kalben and Phelpsâ 7.
Perrault immediately changed his vote
from aye to no and gave notice of a mo
tion to reconsider the vote by which the
amendment was lost at the next me ttlng
Of the board on Monday. The Mayor
ruled that this action held the whole mat
ter up until the proposed motion to re
consider is disposed of and the protests of
the majority were declared out of order.
"That settles me," remarked Attorney
Bishop, as he left the board room, "so
Car as this board is concerned. We'll
iidopt another course that perhaps will
bring- these people to time."
This was probably an intimation that
the gas company intends to carry oat its
threat to shut off the city's lights anil
ccmpel the authorities to appeal to the
courts to force the corporation to turn
them on again.

NEW YORK DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
The New York Commercial says:
"Prunes are generally steady, but holders
have ample supplies of large sizes which
they would be glad to dispose of at a fair
price, It-cannot be said that there is any urg
ing of large sizes for sale. bu,t unquestionably
there are some holders who would not insi.-t
upon outside quotations if a round lot was ur
dered.
"Raisins are dull. There is almost no de
mand for any grade, though It Is said that
uin be held firm up to the present fig
ures until the new crop comes in. Occasional
frmai! "rdei^ :n country dealers, but
none ar- larg< enough to create any stir in
the trade. Meanwhile conditions favor holders.
â¢ the old crop is down to a few hun
dred c :irs. not over L"0 being held in first hands
on th<- coast, and some authorities say that
pply it mv ii less. Crop reports continue
ad the outlook for v. goou yield is
iglng.
"Peaches ate moving slowly on small orders
and holders are n"t anxious sellers. Peeled
:it!r-'ly out of first hands, which
to actual consumptive re
quirements. Prices rule steady, with upward
tendency in substantially all grades. Demand
if slow because of the hluh price and the com
petltion 01 fresh fruits
"Apricots could be sold freely if the open

CANNED FRUITS IN NEW YORK.
Mail advices from New York Bay:
'.'Future sales of California canned fruits
have been liberal since prices on the new
pack were given out. Already some of the
largest packers have sold out, and their prices
are withdrawn. The possibility that crops will
be more or less short in all parts of the coun
try except California causes holders to be un
usually firm in their views on prices. Spot
trmlins is small, being limited to small or
dt-rs to flu immediate retail requirements."

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May Large Northwestern re
ceipts, heavy shipment! to Europe, an increase
on -passage and favorable weather started
wheat easy. The market soon turned strong,
however, and before the session was two hours
old early sellers were clamoring for former
holdings. An announcement by a prominent
authority that the winter wheat area had
been greatly reduced, owing to great
damage by flies, coupled with sensational
claims of damage from private sources, brought
about the change in sentiment. Buying orders
from the Southwest poured into the i, it .â ,â,]
as the market was getting- away from the
bears they made a savage rush to reinstate
themselves, bidding the p. ice up %c at a time.
Reports of European drought helped the ,i'
vance and the market closed near the top of
the day's range. July opened hie i.lgher at
7.". I >.'iiTJ 7 .'. eased off to 75% c, advanced to 77*,e
and closed at 77%Â®77Â»4c. â¢
Heavy receipts and reports of increased acre,
age weakened corn, but the decline was re
covered near the close owing to the rally In
wheat. July closed unchanged.
Oats suffered early from heavy receipts and
favorable crop advices, but with the help of
wheat closed firm at the top figures. July
dosed >/ie higher.
Provisions were steadied by a better shipping

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
"WHEATâ The condition of the winter Wheat
crop of the United States la now said to be
"deplorable." Snow, the statistician, has re
duced the estimate still further to 228,000,000
bushels, against 350,000,000 last year. This bull
news is having 1 Its effect and the market is
decidedly stronger. The Chicago market opened
i hesitatingly, on account of large receipts from
j the Northwest, but subsequently hardened on
stronger foreign cables and the active buying
of the leaders, which seemed to presage higher
prices. Chicago and St. Louis also bought
freely and the feeling was bullish at higher
prices at the close.
Futures here advanced in sympathy with
Chicago, but the spot market remained un
changed.

DECIDUOUS AND CITRUS FRUITS.
Receipts were 1110 boxes Cherries and 600
chests Strawberries.
Cherries continued firm with smaller re
ceipts and sold off well. Apples, Pears and
Apricots were firm, and are selling better than
for a number of years. In fact, this seems like
an old-time season Peaches are quiet, and are
not over good. Plums are in light receipt.
The" Palo Alt'- Strawberry growers have
formed a combination, like the Watsonville
growers, and will hereafter ship to four houses.
The berry market continues steady, receipts be
ing moderate. Currants are in light supply and
Gooseberries are scarcer than ever.
Lemons are hi over supply and weak. Limes
are lower. ! Oranges continue steady.

THE STOCK MARKET.
The Btock and Bond Exchange was not In
session.
All thi- Exchanges will be closed to-day.
Mining st... ks were dull and not materially
changed. The telegram from the pump Bald:
"We have run the first elevator continually
since noon yesterday, using more water power
and lowering the water 62 feet The water is
now iv 1 - feel below the 1730-foot level and 214
feet below the Butro tunnel drain boxes. The
top ol the 1860-foot level station is in good
condition."
The Boston .'mil Montana Copper Mining Com
panj paid a. dividend of $900, 1 yesterday, it
is the second dividend paid this your. Total to
date, 110,776,000.
The Oceanic Steamship Company will pay a
dividend of 60 cents per share June 1.
The San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany has declared a dividend of 42 cents per
share, payable on June 1.
The Giant Consolidated Powder Company has
declared a dividend of 50 cents per share, pay
able June 10.
The California Powder Works paid a dividend
of $1 per share on the 20th.
The Central Light and Power Company's first
dividend of 5 cents per share was iÂ»aid on the
20th.
In the Ophlr mine, in the Central tunnel
working?, the north drift has been extended 11
feet; total length, 2M :'->-t: face in quartz, clay
anil porphyry. The course of the hanging wall
Clay is nearly due north, and if there is no
change in the vourse of this clay we will reach
the Mexican south line In W) feet. The forma
tion that they are now drifting in is very
Will dellned and very like such as ore masses
are found In on the Comstoek. The east drift,
south of the Mexican shaft, was extended 7
feet; total length, 14 feet. At this point an old
east drift was disclosed that had been filled
with waste rock. On a level 56 feet above the
Central tunnel and 150 north of the above men
tioned east drift, there is an east drift in which
there are a few small caves damming up water,
so that the drift cannot be examined until the
water has been drained out. The dams are now
being removed and the drift will be examined
this week. The object of the work is to deter
mine whether an east vein exists in the neigh
borhood of these old workings. The connect
ing drift on the Butro tunnel level was ex
tended 16 feeti total, 164 feet; face in hard
hanging wall rock. Work has been continued
on the quartz stringers, and the southwest
drift extended I teet; total length, 16 feet: the
quartz stringer continues between well defined
clay walls and is beginning to show a greater
wi.lth In the bottom. No ore of any value has
been found in this drift for the past week.
In the Consolidated California and Virginia
mine during the past week the Comstock
Pumping Association has been engaged In the
followins work at the C. and C. shaft: 14<Â»
level â The west crosscut has been extended 27
feet; total, 565 feet; face In hanging wall rock
growing a little harder. There is still 14S feet
of this drift to be run before connection can
be made with crosscut No. 2 from the 1400 level
of the Consolidated Virginia shaft. The force
has been Increased and the drift will be driven
as fast as possible. 1650 level â Necessary re
pair:; are being made in the airways on this
level. 1760 levelâ The south drift from the west
crosscut has been extended S feet; total dis
tance from point of connection with west
crosscut, Im6 feet; face in old timbers and ore.
From this drift 15 cars, or 13-. tons, of the
gold value of $13 72 per ton. have been ex
tracted. The value Is divided as follows: -Gold.
$11 so; silver, Jl '.'2; silver calculated at 61 cents
per ounce. The point at which they started
work In this drift was where it had been bulk
headed to avoid gas and tire during the last
working of this level. For the purpose of con
tinuing work south of this dangerous ground
a drift had been run southwest and then again
turned south. They now find that the ground
and old timbers and charcoal are all thoroughly
saturated with the water that they turned
into this level from the 1650 level in March last.
As near as can be determined from the old
maps and records there is a chance of finding
a fair sized ore body in this neighborhood. The
mai>s show that the mass of ore stoped be
tween the 1800 and 17fo levels was 235 feet south
of the winze that they have Just equipped for
work. The ore that they have been extracting
is 80 feet east of the north and south drift on
the ISOO level. No west crosscut Is shown upon
the map Bt this point andjio reference Is made
In the reports of such a crosscut. The easterly
dip of the vein is not enough to have carried
the ore far enough east to have been exposed
by the INK) north and south drift. The shaft
men have been engaged during the week in
lowering the first elevator with it.s sections of
pressure and discharge pipes, so that it has
not been possible to install the new line of
6-Inch air pipe in the shaft. This they hope
to do before they shut down to repair the
main hoist.
In the Sierra Nevada mine, on the 140-foot
level, the north lateral drift was advanced to
a total length of 273 feet. The face is In low
2rnde quartz. East crosscut No. 1 Is out 54
feet. The face Is in clay. On the 900-foot level
the north drift from the end of west crosscut
No. 2 is out 66 feet. The face is in clay and
quartz.
At the Osbiston shaft of the Best & Belcher
and Gould & Curry mines they have started to
erect the gallows "frame. The water raised in
the shaft 14 feet 9 inches the past week. Total
depth below the station, 72 feet 9 inches. The
cause of this raise was a cave some distance
above the station that has deranged the plat
form over which they conducted the water to
the Sutro tunnel drain flume. This will soon be
repaired.
In the Chollar and Potosi mines the joint
west tunnel has been advanced during the week
40 feet; total length, 50 feet: face in porphyry.
Sutro tunnel level â The Zadigr drift has been
cleaned out and retlmbered 20 feet during the
week; total, 280 feet; face In badly caved
ground.

William B. Parsons, Chief. Engineer
of the Brice Syndicate, Returns
After Eight Months in the
Heart of the Empire.
William B. Parsons, chief engineer of
the Brice railroad syndicate of New York
City, was among yesterday's arrivals
from Hongkong on the steamer China.
Mr. Parsons has spent the past eight
months in surveying the route of the 750
miles of railroad which it is the inten
tion of the Brice syndicate to build be
tween Hankow and Canton. His labors
have taken him into the principal cities
of the empire and have brought him in
close contact with those men of all na
tions who are just now doing politics and
making history over there.
Mr. Parsons' duties have uiso taken
him and his five assistants through the
roughest and most inhospitable region of
the country, and he has come out of it
much Impressed with the future it holds
out to America, for profitable trade. "Just
now." said he last evening, "England is
holding the empire together. Were It not
for her it would be divided among the
powers next week, or the week after at
the latest. Or on the other hand it" the
â United States were to make common
cau.se with England the division would
be accomplished as quickly, and I think
the United States would come out with
as pood a slice as almost any of the
others.

"You will not find an American or an
Englishman there who will not agree as
to the advisability and desirability of this
country participating in the breaking up;
neither will you find one who thinks this
country will. They would like to see it,
but do not expect to.
"America does not realize yet what Her
trade advantages and possibilities ai"e
there. The Chinese generally wish to
favor us. l had one day an opportunity
to see. I walked through the market dis
trict of one of the largest cities of the
empire with the president of the muni
ip-iliry. an Englishman. 'Notice the
markings on the boxes,' said he. I did,
and thrve-fourths of the stuffs on sale
and stored were of American production.
American motives are in use on nearly
all the railways and, as the demand in
creases. American, machinery is getting
the per hand in the market."
Concerning his own road Mr. Parsons
had.lfttle to .sir. He said he could not
say when actual construction would be
begun as he is just returning to New
York with his reports and until they have
been considered no action will be taken.
It may never be, for the reason that when
the partition .begins it is apparent now
tin' Russia- will ' acquire the section
through which the surveys run, and unless
some deal were made with the Russian
Government the American road would be
quickly shut out by the Russian Man

MORE MONEY IN SIGHT
FOR THE DEWEY STATUE
THERE is a contest on among the members of the committee having In 0
charge the monument to Admiral Dewey and the American navy that <â¦.
promises great results. At the meeting last Friday every member 0
was assigned a certain district with instructions to make a thorough <r
canvass of it for subscriptions. Saturday being a half holiday, the fg
committeemen had little opportunity to work, but the members were x
all out bright and early yesterday. â :Â«.
Not one of them would give an inkling of the amount he had raised 0
during the day, saying he would keep that quiet until the next meeting of <f>
the committee, which will be held at Mayor Phelan's private office Thurs- >Â£
day afternoon at 4 o'clock. Several members, however, smiled complacently Â£
and admitted that they did not believe they would make the poorest show- <{>
Inc. &
From this it appears that there Is a friendly rivalry among them to see V
who will turn in the largest amount at the next meeting.. One gentleman Â£
admitted last night, with no little satisfaction, that if the other seventeen <$>
members did as well as he, the $50,000 mark would be left far behind by 0
next Thursday. Â£â 
To-day being a holiday, nothing can be done toward augmenting the >?
fund, but' it will only serve to stimulate the patriotism of the people and Â£
call to their minds the debt they owe the heroes of Manila Bay. Let the <;.
citizens remember, when they come down town to-day to witness the pa- Â£
rade. that the business offices of all the newspapers are open and attaches Â£
will receive subscriptions to the fund. Contributors will be given a receipt 9
which can be changed for a souvenir receipt as soon as they come from the Â£
engravers. <&
Several plans are under consideration for the raising of funds and will &
probably be developed this week. A number of public entertainments have' <*"
already . been suggested by patriotic people, who are willing to contribute 8
their- talents and their time to the cause. Some of them may be arranged, <Â§>
but the members of the committee are of the opinion that the entire $100,- 0
000 will be raised without resorting to anything of that kind. ' x
Residents of interior cities and towns are bestirring themselves in the %â¢
matter, and in a few days coin will be poiiring in from the country. If A

FLANAGAN NOT TRIED
Charges Against Him Dismissed.
Receiving Hospital Criticized.
The Board of Health held a special s---
--sion last night to Investigate charges
against Deputy Meat Inspector J. J.
Flanagan, which were embodied in a re
port filed by Chief Meat Inspector Davis.
While engaged in the performance of his
duty at Butchertown last Wednesday
night Flanagan became engaged In an
altercation with Albert L. Noll, engineer
for Miller & l.ux. mows were struck.
and during the excitement of the mixt':>
Flanagan bit Noll on the finger.
When the board convened Becretary
Dunne read a communication from MiHer
>v Lux in which they stated that the mat
ter had been brought to their notice and
that they had no desire to prosecute
Flanagan. Noll did not appear, as he did
not wish to air the facts of his (juarr.-l
with the Deputy Inspector (Jefore the
board.
After hearing Flanagans story the
board decided to drop the charges unless
the representatives of Miller & Lux em
bodied them in a formal complaint. As
Flanagan has deeply regretted the oc
currence the firm will in all probability
fail to press the case any further. Alt c
the meeting Flanagan was taken Into
custody by Policeman Butterworth and
booked* ai the City Prison on a charge of
attempt ai mayhi m.
A letter was. received from \\ â¢ Mv Page,
secretary of the Building Trades Coun
cil In which he complained of the treat
ment accorded one Zlnkan at the Receiv
ing Hospital when he was taken there
last Saturday to be treated for severe
injuries sustained In falling from a huild-
Ing on which he was working. The com
munication was read and the board fie
cided to investig.a.- the matter at the
:.. x; meeting. It ran as follows:
"To the Honnrat.ii- Board of Healthâ
Gentlemen: I am instructed to bring to
your notice the case of Mr. Zinkan. a
. arpChter, who was on last Saturday.
May 27 Injured In falling from a build
ing upon which be was working. He was
examine,] at the Receiving Hospital by
the doctor in charge at 4 ]>. m. otl that
afternoon and left In a ward without
any attention, not even being given a
drink Of water until 9 a. m. the next
morning. When his friends called and
requested to see him permission was de
nied. It was not until the following
morning when they called to take him to
another hospital that they were allowed
to Bee him.
"Now, gentlemen, this is a very serious
matter, and I have no doubt that men of
your standing in the community will see
that this shall not happen again. We. as
working mechanics, rely upon the service
of the Receiving Hospital while in the
pursuit of our daily bread. Such treat
ment as heretofore described should not
be tolerated in a civilized community.
"Trusting that you will give this matter
early consideration, I remain, yours.

A CLIMATOLOGICAL RECORD.
Forecast Official McAdie Makes an
Innovation.
Alexander O, McAdie, forecast official
and section director of the Weather Bu
reau, yesterday completed the April re
port of the California climate and crbp
service.
An innovation in the bulletin is the.
table showing the weather and tempera
ture conditions of this city for the past
twenty-eight years, compiled from the
ii cords of the local oureau. The fact is
established that the climate has not
changed during the period covered by
these records. The highest monthly mean
temperature Is fiO.ft, for September, and
the lowest 50.1. for January. The rain
fall will be considered in the next issue
â  : the monthly bulletin. It is proposed
t< publish each month data relating- to
BOrne one or two stations, beginning with
those having long period records. -Volun
tary observers are requested to send rec
of five years or more, together with
any notes showing extreme conditions.
Mr. McAdie takes iho opportunity to
thank the many voluntary observers for
the faithful work performed by them un

COSTLY SUNDAY FISHING
J. Tilles Paid Two Hundred Dollars
to Break the. Sabbath.
It cost John Titles, a fisherman, just $200
and fees of an attorney to go fishing on
Sunday. yesterday he was fined that
amount by Judge Hitchcock of Sulsun for
violating the State law which prohibits
the catching of salmon between sundown
Saturday evening and sundown on Sun
day evening. The law was passed In or
der to give these fish an opportunity to
go up the rivers to spawn, but if the
nets of the fishc-rs in the lower bay are
s. i all of the time during the run but few
escape.
The up-river fishermen favor the law
but those farther down the bay want it
changed. The arrest of Tilles was made
by Deputy Davis on April 9. together with
the confiscation of the mans net and
boat. Another net, for which no one has
laid claim, was found and tÂ«ke n at the
same time. This has broken up the Sun

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 30, 1899.
JUST AN ORDINARY
SCHOOL EXAMINATION
| NO POLITICS IN THE LATEST DE
MAND OF SUPERINTENDENT.
Schools Can Only Be Graded by an
Inspection of the Pupils' Work
and That Must Be Writ
ten Out.
There has been a great deal of crlti
eism of the parents of school children on
the scheme of the Superintendent <>1"
Schools to demand from the classes writ
ten examinations to qualify for promo
tion, it has been denounced as a plan to
save work for the. teachers and an at
tempt to shift the responsibility for a
failure from the teachers, who should
know tli. capabilities of the pupil, to the
pupil. It is charged that it is an attempt
on th>' part of the teacher to cram the
undone work of months into a few weeks,
much to the detriment of the child's
standing, and it has also been charged
that it is an attempt to evade the proper
responsibilities of the instructor.
Superintendent Webster says, however,
that the scheme is only to allow of a
more uniform grading of the schoolÃ. As
it is now. hi says, the only way he can
judge of the standing of a school is by
an examination. He cannot go to everj
school in the city and personally exam
ine each class, and so he must judge by
the standing of the pupils in an examina
tion. It is of vital Importance, he says .that
each school be on an educational equal
ity with every other. In some schools the
highest grade is below the second grade
of another, and when pupils are trans
ferred from one to another they find
themselves either far behind and unable
:.> catch up. or they are far ahead and
have to go over the work they have often
done before: they lose time, grow list
less and Idle, and a real harm is done.
Th.- only way to keep the schools on an
equality, Mr. Webster says, is to exam
ine the pupils to find out just how far
they have advanced, and having done
that, to hurry the slow ones and keep
back the too rapid.
There is no political significance in the
examinations, be .-ays. It was reported
at one time that the idea of examinations
grew out of a' desire to find fault with
tin- teachers, and by securing resigna
tion? from those whose classes made the
poorest showing make room for more ap
pointments to pay the political debts
of the board; but this idea is scouted by
the Superintendent. He says there can
be no politics in such v proceeding, and
he lets it go at that. It is well known
that one teacher may have an exception
ally dull class, while another may have
;.!i exceptionally bright one. and it is re
alized that the best proof of a teacher's
ability i.- not always found in the stand
ing of her pupils.
A FIT SAVED HIS LITE.
A Despondent Lover Was About to
Make a Second Attempt at
Suicide.
Fred Redhouse, who threw himself In
front of one of the Sutro electric cars
about three days ago and who afterward
stated that his perilous position was the
result of an accident, was taken to the
Receiving Hospital early this morning
suffering from the effects of a fit. Short
ly after his arrival there some one com
municated with Alice Reynolds, with
whom Redhouse is in love, stating that
lie had cut his throat, and shortly after
ward the woman appeared with the fol
lowing letter which she had received a
short time before:
Mv Dear Alice: When jrou read this, letter
I w'lll be in the other world. I wisli when I
threw myself on the Sutro railroad track that
I hud been out In two. I love you better than
my life, and without you I don't want to live.
To-night I am KOing to the Louvre and Intend
to CUT my throat. You have deserted me and
I have nothinx more to live for. FHEI).
After writing the letter Redhouse went
to the Louvre, but before he had a chance
to carry out his intentions he was seized
with a "tit and taken away in an ambu
lance. He had no weapno in his posses
sion, but is said to have always carried
a razor. He probably Intended to secure
a deadly weapon in the saloon.
It Is Not a Trust.
The Supremo Court yesterday handed
down an opinion in the ruse of the estate
of Charles A. Steel, deceased of Los An
geles, affirming the judgment and order
|of the lower court. \V. M., Charles A.
and ldella D. Steel, children of the de
; ceased, applied to the Superior Court for
: an order of distribution of a nortion of
i the property, which was denied. It was
from thia denial that the appeal was
taken. They contended that the will of
I their father purports to vest the estate
in trustees for the benefit of the widow
and certain other children, and that the
1 trust Is void under the statutes of the
! Civil Code against perpetuities. The Su
preme Justices do not take this view of
the will, and the appeal was denied.
Christian Endeavor Reception.
A reception was tendered by the Golden
Gate Union of the Christian Endeavor
Society to its recently elected president,
J. A. Wiles, in the parlors of Calvary
Church last evening. The evening w;us
. njoyably spent In music and speeches.
Mr Wiles addressed his friends and gave
an interesting account of the recent prog
ress of the society, stating that Dr.
Clark' president of thu United Society,
had remarked that the recent State con
vention in Oakland was the largest he
had ever attended.

LOVING TRITE
TO MEMORY Of
THOMAS MOORE
Admirers of the Poet
Sing His Praises.
FEAST OF MUSIC AND VERSE
DR. VOORSANGER EULOGIZES
THE "SWEET SINGER."
Celebration of the 119 th Anniversary
of the Birth of Ireland's Minstrel-
Patriot in Metropolitan
Temple.
Metropolitan Temple was filled to over
flowing last night by the admirers of
Thomas Moore, the "Sweet Singer of
Ireland," the occasion being the celebra
tion of tho one hundred and nineteenth
anniversary of the birth of Ireland's
patriot-minstrel by the Halfe-Moore Club.
The interior of the temple was hand
somely decorated with the national colors
of Erin, ferns, palms and roses, while the
stars and stripes were prominently dis
played in the center of the stage, form
ing a drapery for the speaker's desk.
Thomas K. Hannerman presided, and be
side him on the stage were seated Rev.
Dr. Voorsanger, the orator of the even
ing, and Mayor Phelan. The programme
was (jf rare merit and artistically ar
ranged and rendered. Every number was
appended with true Irish impartiality,
and tin- vocal solos by Miss A. Rooney
and Miss K. V. McC'loskey were especially
favored in this respect. But the feature
of the evening was the address of Dr.
Yoorsanger on "Thomas Moore as an
Irish Nationalist."
Dr. .Voorsanger made a decided hit by
his apt remark when introduced by Mr.
Hannerman.
"I can think of but two things that
recommended me to Mr. Bannerman as
the orator of this occasion," he said.
"One is that I looked so much like an
Irishman, and the other that being a
Jewish theologian I must needs know
more about Thomas Moore than any one
else."
It was several minutes before the tu
mult of laughter and applause subsided,
and then the speaker proceeded to pay a
glowing tribute to the poet whom all
Irishmen love to honor. He declared that
the battle-cry of the Irish as poured forth
in song by Moore was the ancient battle
cry given to the children of Israel by
Moses, and which has become the battle
cry of all liberty-loving peoples of the
world, "God, country and human liberty.
The speakers remarks that the part
taken by the Irish in developing this
country was sufficient answer to the
boasted pretense that this country was
altogether built Up by the Anglo-Saxons
was roundly applauded. In conclusion
Dr. Voorsanger said that while Moor, ad
vocated peaceful methods as against des
perate deeds to secure the freedom of
Ireland, he regarded him as the true Irish
Nationalist. Following is the programme

DIED WHILE TRAVELING.
James de Fremery, the Well-Known
Capitalist, Passed Away on a
Train in Colorado.
James de Fremery, who, according: to
the telegraphic dispatches, died in Colo
rado while en route to this city, was the
founder of the well-known firm of Gilde
meester, De Fremery & Co. of this city,
which is still in existence under the llrm
name of James de Fremery & Co.
The deceased was president of the
Chamber of Commerce for two terms and
v. as active in the management of the Sav
ings and Loan Society, the Giant Powder
Company, the American Sugar Refining
Company, several Oakland street railway
companies and various other enterprises.
He was also Consul for the Netherlands
for many years, receiving in recognition
of his services the order of Knight of the
Netherlands Lion. Ho was also Consul
for Mtcklenberg Schwerin.
His work, however, by which he was
best known in this city was in connec
tion with the San Francisco Savings
Union, founded by himself, John Archi
bald, Albert Miller and others in 1862. and
of which he was president for about
twenty-five years, the success of the insti
tution being in great measure due to his
financial skill and the confidence reposed
by the public in his prudence and integ
rity.
Mr. de Fremery was born on February
17, 1826, on the estate of his family at
Ouwendyck. near The Hague. Holland.
Leaving home at an early age, he arrived
in New York in IS4K, where he engaged in
commercial pursuits. He remained there
three years and left for California by way
of Panama, arriving here in 1849.
Socially he was excellent company, hos
pitable and charitable; deserving poverty
never appealed to him in vain, and his
charities followed the ungrateful as they
did those who appreciated his benevo
lence. Ho was a man of extensive read
ing, and a writer of force; he contributed
to the newspapers when there were ob
jects to accomplish in the interests of
progress and good government; he wrote
miscellaneous articles on many occasions,
and published several books. Of late
years he has been busy with the prepara
tion of a local history.
The wife of Mr. de Fremery died several
years since in Switzerland. For descend

CHOSEN FRIENDS.
Celebration in Honor of the Founda
tion of the Order Twenty-
Years Ago.
So great was the crush at Odd Fellows*
Hall last night by those who desired to
attend the twentieth anniversary cele
bration and jubilee of the Order of Cho
sen Friends that before the second num
ber on the programme had been an
nounced it became necessary to close the
outer doors, and by reason of this hun
dreds were denied admission. An inter
esting programme of music, songs and
specialties of a high order was present
ed, those taking part being Miss May S.
Cook, Miss Katie Krone, the Waterman
Bisters, Stanley Rankin, Professor Tra
velle, William Fletcher and the Misses
Annie and Grace Shean.
There was also an address by Grand
Councilor \V. H. Savage, remarks by
Past Grand Councilor Boehm. and the
presentation of Chosen Friends' watches
to a number of ladies and gentlemen in
recognition of their services to the order.
DEWEY'S COUSIN IS HERE.
Arrived Yesterday on the China After
a Visit to the Admiral.
A. B. Dewcy of Chicago, a cousin of
Admiral Dewey, arrived yesterday with
his wife from Hongkong on the Bteamer
China. Mr. Dewey has been in Manila
and Japan since January and in March
called upon his illustrious relative on his
flagship, the Olympia. in Manila Bay. He
spent three weeks in and about the city
and on the American firing line.
He ridicules the reports of Dewey's ill
health and says that, on the contrary, the
admiral was in as good spirits and in
much better physical condition than h<'
would expect to find a man of his years
after the ordeal he had been through.
Mr. Dewey says the American volun
teers, while they would be glad to be
home, at the same time are anxious to
stay where they are as long as there Is
fighting to do. The health of the hoys.
he says, is better than at any time since ;
they left San Francisco and the hospital
service has been reduced to an almost
perfect working basis.
Mr. and Mrs. Dewey leave to-morrow
for Monterey and Santa Cruz.
PORT CHARGES IN
MEXICAN PORTS
IMPORTANT CIRCULAR ISSUED
BY THE CONSUL.
Lighterage Fees Being Unlawfully
Assessed on Ships and Cargoes
in the Southern Re
public.
The following: circular conveying im
portant information regarding port
charges in Mexican ports has been is
sued by the local Mexican Consul:
The President of the republic has
ordered that the Consulate shall, by
every means at its disposal, make
known to the shippers of goods into
our country that the Government has
been informed that some navigation
companies have wrongfully charged
them for lighterage, dockage and ton
nage on loading and unloading and
other charges, expenses and fiscal
fees, which are or are not paid, but
are charged fraudulently by the com
panies to the shippers or consignees,
or which, if paid, amount to mucn less
than charged to them by the com
panies.
The President recommends to you
that in the notices issued by the Con
sulate and posted in the office care
should be taken to state that for the
benefit of the shippers of goods into
the republic, as also of those com
panies that do not commit the abuse
referred to, he has ordered thai such
notice be given so that they may in
all instances verify the exactness of
the charges that the companies may
make for port dues.
In the notice it ! should be stated
that the only fiscal port (lues charge
able to -merchandise- on its importa
tion, and which, according to law, the
Custom-houses should collect from
the Importers, and not from the ships,
is that of "loading and unloading,"
applicable at present only at the port
of Vera Cruz, and at the rate of $1
(silver) for each ton of 1000 kilograms
of merchandise, gross weight, except
those specified in Circulars Nos. S3 and
85. .of July 28 and of September 30,
1898, which said merchandise pays
only 50 cents for each ton weight.
Cargoes subject to the dues stated
which are discharged totally by means
of lighters, or those which are trans
shipped from one ship to another an
chored in the port of Vera Cruz, com-,
ing consigned to other places, pay
only one-half of the rate before men
tioned.
All other port dues chargeable at
ports of foreign entry are imposed on
the ships. and not on the merchandise.
Notice. must also be given that,- ac
cording to the law of the country,
no fiscal dues are paid in gold, but in
silver, and that the charges made in
some ports by some companies, au
thorized therefor by the Government,
are also payable in silver; as for ex
ample, the so-called "bar dues"
charged by the Canalization Company
of the port of Tampico, the charge's
for unloading on private wharves or
on those of construction companies,
such as those at Progreso, Frontera
and Laguna (Carmen Island), and also
the expense of lighterage, delivery and
other fees that some companies are
accustomed to charge as in addition
to the freight.
Finally, regarding those vessels that
bring merchandise, with lighterage
paid, to ports such as Vera Cruz. where
dues for loading and [unloading
are payable, attention 'should be
called to the fact that if the vessel
ties up to the wharf or dock there is
no expense of lighterage, and there
fore dues for loading and unloading
are charged in full; but If there should
be lighterage then those dues are re
duced one-half, as already stated; but
in either event the dues for loading
and unloading are chargeable to the
Importers and not to the ships.
TO TRY MIDWEEK COURSING.
At the Instance of Leashmen the Ex-
periment Will Be Tried at
Union Park.
With but one coursing park in opera
tion in the metropolitan district, it has
been found impossible to accept all the
dopa offered for entry at Union Park. At
suggestion of the leashmen it has been
determined to try midweek coursing:. If
this proves a success it will be con
tinued.
The first trial will be made on June 8
with a 64-dog stake, the entry being
limited to non-winners.
At their meeting yesterday the Super
visors again deferred action on the ap
plication of the lngleside Coursing Club
for permission to resume the selling of
auction pools at its park.

an Accusation.
EIGHT HOUR LAW VIOLATED
ALAMEDA'S CLERK TAKES UP
WHITE MAN'S BURDEN.
Asks for Judgment in the Sum of
Five Hundred Dollars Against
Trustees Mackie and
Schulte.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
DOS Broadway. May 29.
Ben I". Lamborn. Alumeda's City Clerk,
popularly known as the Atlas of the En
cinal City, has taken up "the white man's
burden," and created a mild sensation
this afternoon by filing an unusual docu
ment in ihe Superior Court, asking for
emoval of two Alameda City Turs-
The document, no doubt the first
kind ever filed in this State, was in
nature of an "accusation." Clerk
Lamborn appearing in the role of "in
former' against City Trustee* Alexander
â¢ and William X Schulte, whom he
â¢a with refusing ami neglecting to
l â  : ;::) the duties of their official posl
onnectlon with the manage
ment of the municipality's electric light
plant. in his "accusation" Lamborn
makes â¢ ing allegation:
Said respondents and each of them 'lid In
the month of May. 1899, ami particularly on the
nlnthj tonth ana eleventh Jays of said month,
compel and require certain laborers named J.
O. Messer and James l.>avls, employed to work
In and about the city's electric light plant or
works, to labor and work more than eight
hours in each of said days, in direct viola
tion of section 12iJ of the Political Code of
the Stute of California.
In his prayer he not only asks mat
respondents be cited t.> appear before the
rlor Court and show cause why they
should not be removed from office, but
that judgment be niven against each of
Bald respondents in favor of deponent, as
informer, in ih<- sum of iJCfi and costs,
"all as provided by section 77:' of the
I ' lilfornia."
Th( "accusation," tor that is the title
of th< document, was prepared by Attor
ney Charles E. Nay lor, a prominent mem
ber of the Municipal League of Alameda.
Mr. Lamborn, commenting upon the pc
â  suit, pointed out th<- importance of
its final determination to the laboring
: the fact that this action was
tlrsi of Its ktml ever taken in this
"It is simply a question <>i policy In
grinding men down to worh fourteen
â  said Mr. Lamborn, "and I
don't regard It good policy, either. It is
which every laboring man and
the trades unions are interested."
Later in the day Clerk Lamborn held
a i namber session with Superior Judge
â¢ regarding the issuance of th-
citation. !!â¢â¢ laid the matter before his
Honor very comprehensively, relating
â¢he City Trustees had deprived En
â  Messer of the assistance of the
engine wiper at the eleotric plant, and
that, therefore, Messer has been compell
ed to attend to these additional duties.
Judge Greene refused to direct a cita
tion to Issue mi the ground that although
the law requires that all labor contracts
specify ciyht hours t nstitute a day's
labor in thÂ«- present ease there wf do
contract. Judge Qreene ruled also that
the Alarneda Trustees did not compel
Messer and Davis to wurk more than
tight hours, but that if they work longer
hours it was of their own volition.
Though chagrined over Ju'iK'- Greene's
U to issue a citation, Mr. Lamborn
proposes to muk>- a test of the matter by
.â -' imf meatis or other.

ALL ANXIOUS
TO DISPROVE A
POLITICAL PLOT
Coroner JVÂ£ehrmann
on the Rack.
ILLEGAL FEES ARE REPORTED
SAID TO BE THE WORK OF A MAN
WITH A GRUDGE.
â Â«. â
After a Months Deliberation All
Hands Will Meet and Will
Talk the Matter
Over.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ SOS Broadway. May 29.-
Krom remarks made at the Supervisors'
meeting to-day it is very evident that
some members of the hoard believe that
other members .are responsible for the
critical examination of Coroner Mehr
mann's accounts made by the county ex
pert.
The expert has prepared a very lengthy
report, h * â  1 1 i n k forth in detail how Dr.
Mehrmann has .since taking office the first
of the year overcharged the county $171 -5.
The report was before the board to-day
for discussion. "Mr. Expert," said Su
pervisor Church, "did anybody on this
board authorize you to take more pains
in examining Coroner Mehrmann's ac
counts than those of any other public of
flclal' No, sir."
"Mr. Expert," said Supervisor Roeth,
"did 1 ever suggest to you that you be
very careful in examining Coroner Melir
mann's bills?" "No. sir."
"Mr. Expert." said Supervisor Mitchell,
â¢â¢did l ever Induce you to pay more at
tention to the bills of the Coroner than
to any other bills?" "No. sir."
Mr. Wells suggested that it would per
haps be advisable t<> have the Coroner
present when his overcharges were dis
cussed, as a matter of decency and Jus
tice. And all agreed to this suggestion.
Supervisor Church partly let the cat out
of the bag t>> saying: "There lias been a
story going around that the report or
the l-xpert on these bills was for the pur
pose of paying a political debt. If 1 have
a political debt, I will pay it in my own
way outside this board. But If a bill be
correct l will vote to pay it. If the bill Is
not correct, I will vote against it."
Mr. Wells said that be had a particular
regard for L>r. Mehrmann, and he was
perfectly astonished when he heard the
rumor that he was one of the men that
instigated this campaign against the Cor
oner.
After some further discussion concern
ing the payment of political debts, per
sonal responsibility for inciting an investi
gation of Coroner Mehrmann s accounts,
and so form. Chairman Mitchell decided
that everybody concerned should have
ample time to discuss the matter intelli
gently, and he named July 3 as the time
when Coroner Mehrmann would appear
and offer any explanation he might de
sire to make.
The trouble over the Coroner's fees
arises from the fact that for the past ten
years Coroners have interpreted tht act
governing their tees to please themselves.
and no one has opposed them. The in
vestigation is not along the lines that
Dr. Mehrmann has willfully made over
charges, but for the purpose of having
the meaning of the law finally deter-
I mined.

THE SA:N FiUJS CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 30, 1899.
ABRAHAM WILL
ADMINISTER ON
HIS OWN FUNDS
A Dead Man Appears
on the Scene.
FORTUNE FOUND IN BANK
DID NOT KNOW OF RICHES IN
For Twenty Years He Has Been Lost
in Mining Districts While
His Money Steadily
Grew.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, May 29.
R. Abraham, who has been declared
legally dead and upon whose estate the
Public Administrator had been granted
letters of administration, appeared in
Oakland to-day and satisfied the Admin
istrator and his attorneys that he Is still
a long way from the grave.
For over nineteen years a comfortable
sum of money has been lying to Abra
ham's credit at the Union Bank of Sav
ings. A few weeks ago the Public Ad
ministrator was granted letters, and has
since been making every effort to dis
cover the heirs of Abraham. But instead
of discovering the heirs, they discovered
Abraham himself.
The story Abraham tells of his doings
for the last ten years is that of many
other men in this State who Immure
themselves for long periods in the min
ing districts. Abraham did not know he
owned any money In the Oakland bank
until an effort was made to find the heirs.
He says that at the time the deposit was
made he w;is In Columbus, New, inter
est, d in mining. A large sum was placed
i on deposit, and he after a time drew his
check for this sum, not thinking that in
l la*- interval it had earned large interest.
The Interest remained and the interest
j upon it has been accumulating each year
i umil it has now reached a large sum.
In the Superior Court a citation has
been issued as the result of an amicable
1 agreement between the Public Adminis
trator. Attorney G. E. de Colin, R. Abra
ham and his attorney, calling the Ad
i ministrator into court to have his letters
revoked, so that all the proceedings will
] be regular and Abraham can return to
his home in the mining districts with
: his fortune in his pockets., Strictly speak-
Ing, the Administrator's attorney Is not
entitled to any fee for discovering Ab
raham and nutting him in the way of
r< verlng his own. But the man sup
posed to be deail has expressed the opin
ion that any one who would llnd him a
goodly sum of money, of the existence of
which he did not "know, Is entitled to a
good reward, even though the law doesn't
provide one for him In such an instance.
SUSPECTS UNDER ARREST.

PICNICKERS
THREATENED TO
HANG STERNBERG
Lively Time at the
Mariners' Outing.
There was a lively "scrap* 1 at the picnic
given by the Mariners' Association Sun
day which for a time threatened to result
ir. a general riot.
The trouble was brought about by a
gang of "grafters" trom the city, who
attempted to rob the susceptible members
of the association .>y various sure-thing
gambling devices. Scarcely had the boat
containing the pienhk'-rs left the < ity
when the president of Lhe organization dis
covered the presen -c of at least a half
dozen "grafters" and "sure-thing" opera
tor*. He at oner- held Â consultation With
several other officers of the association
and it was screed thai In case they at
tempted to "work" the crowd they were
t' be summarily dealt with.
After arriving at the picnic grounds one
of the gang opened up a "drop" game,
vlilrh is prohibited by law. Several
"boosters" gathered around the operator
cf the ">kin" game and vainly endeavored
to induce the anxious onlookers to make
a bet.
"Yer can't lose," confidently remarked
one of the gang to a member of the as
sociation, who appea.cd to be interested
in the game
"Play a five-dollar nott and if yer don't
â¢win I'll sec that yer >, r et yer money back."
A well-dressed young man. who was a
guest of the association, overhearing the
assuring words <.f the "capper,-" quickly
produced his purse and taking out a
five-dollar gold piece placed it with the
dealer, of course he lost and after real
izing that he had been robbed he entered
B vigorous "kick."- In a few minutes the
members Of the association, learning of
the robbery, decided to drive the ""graft
ers" off the grounds. While they were
discussing how to get rid of them another
guest complained thai be bad neon robbed
of Jio by a "pea and shell" operator.
Angered beyond measure a specially se
lected committee of mariners charged on
the "grafters" and after wrecking the
"drop game started i>. disperse the gang.
n was then thai the fun commenced

is known as "Crooked George, drew his
revolver and threatened to kill anybody

He was seized from behind and quickly

disposition to be ugly he was knocked
down and severely beaten.

UNUSUAL significance is attached
to Memorial day. which will be
more generally observed to-day
than it has ever been. Dur
ing the long interim of peace
after the close of the rebellion the day
gradually came to be regarded as more
of a holiday than one set apart in
which to pay some slight tribute to the
nation's fallen heroes, but within the
year the country has passed through
another struggle that has proved not
SO sanguinary as the four years' light
ing of '61-5, but still has added many
names to the honor roll.
In addition to those of Chat matchless
'â¢â  army that subjugated their rebellious
brethren of the South, who have re
! sponded to the final roll call during th<>
year â and the grizzled veterans' ranks
; are all too rapidly thinning â thousands
of their sons who responded to the
more recent call to arms have found
soldiers' graves. On the slopes of El
Caney. Siboney and Santiago; In the
swamps and morasses of the far-off
i Philippines; in the cemeteries of every
1 State in the Union sleep those who
gave their lives to their country as
freely as did their fathers a third of
! a century ago.
To-day the graves of these younger
; heroes will be moistened with tears and
garlanded with sweet blossoms as well
:as those of that former generation:
loving memories will go out to those
who sk-ep on foreign shores as well
as those whose sepulchers were dug in
, Southern soil: the veteran of '61 will
clasp hands with the veteran of "98.
In San Francisco, the Memorial ser
, vices will lit- divided into two parts,
one at the Grand Army plat In Odd
I Fellows' Cemetery, and the other at
the National Cemetery at the Presidio.
I Prior to the first services, there will
j be an imposing parade of all the O.
â¢ A. R. posts In the city, with the ex
c-ption of Thomas Post, escorted by
military organizations, civic societies
and school children. The parade- will
form at Market and Battery streets at
10 a. m. and move up Market street to
Golden Gate avenue to Van
dently determined to Have the "graftT '
from being beaten to death, took a band
li the melee. He ln'carac convinced in a
short time that be was "up agaJnst it." as
hf afterward expressed it. and took to his
heels.
At least a dozen of the brawny mariners
followed him, intending to wreak sum
mary vengeance, as they believed that
Sternberg was responsible for the pres
< i i â¢â  of the members of the "sure-thing"
1 fraternity. Cries of "Lynch him!" "Shoot
! the scoundrel!'" and similar threatening
expressions were burled at Sternberg as
lie made rapid strides inward the railroad
track in the hopes of catching a train
and thus eludifig his pursuers.
Realizing that the angry mariners
meant business. Policemen Morris and
, Uines, after overtaking Sternberg, drew
' their olfbs and ordered the crowd back.
'â  Swrnberg tremblingly appealed to them
to save his life and as the crowd drew
back in obedience to the command of the
police officers the convicted ballot-box
stuffer emitted a sign of relief.
"I had a narrow escape." he remarked,
as he wiped the beads of perspiration
. from his brow. 'They (meaning the
crowd) had the best oC it. but if 1 had
i had my 45-caliber Colts with me there
would have been something doing."
Thinking that Sterrvierg and his friends
were still in danger of being mobbed by
the angry crowd, the police officers had
them sent back to the city on the regu
lar train.
"It's a lucky thing for them that they
Â«'id not return on the picnic train." re~
marked one of the mariners yesterday.
"We were prepared for them and intended
t< give them a warm reception."
Sternberg denies that he was with the
gang of grafters, but admits that he in
tended to run a roalette wheel on the
grounds providing that no objection was
effered.
Last night several members of the
Mariners' Association visited police head
quarters and informed Chief Lees of the
! operations of the gari* of grafters at their
picnic. To-day an effort will be made by
the police to apprehend them.

COMMISSIONERS
TO PARIS MEET
AND ORGANIZE
Runyon Receives the
Highest Honors.
The California Commissioners of the
Paris Exposition held their lirst session
yesterday morning. In a short half hour
the preliminaries of organization were
'. perfected and the commission arrived at a
: status ready for the prosecution of the
! labors, for which they were appointed.
The morning meeting, which was in the
office of \V. W. Foote In the Spreckels
; building, brought the three Commissioners
| together for the first time. Ben C. Tru
i man, E. W. Runyon and W. \V. Foote,
I the three appointees of the Governor, and
Varney \\\ Qasklll, who was unanimous
; ly elected the secretary of the commis
slon, appeared sharply at the hour of
: meeting and little time was lost in reach
ing the business for which they had as
sembled. According to programme E. W.
Kunyon of Red Bluff was elected presi
dent and (raskill secretary. Gaskill's sal
ary was fixed at $250 a month. The Com
missioners then took a recess until 3
I o'clock in the afternoon, when they again
met for the further transaction of busi
i ness.
Tho afternoon session was held at the
permanent offices of the commission,
| rooms 66 and SG. Occidental Hotel. A let
ter which Foote had received from Sen
; ator Perkins inquiring about the arrange
ments for the distribution of the Califor
nia exhibits was read and discussed.
None of the local Commissioners seemed
to know just what the Paris Commission
ers intended to do concerning the United
States exhibits, as to the space allowed
and the distribution of the local exhibits
Foote suggested that one of the State
commission take a trip to Chicago and
consult Ferdinand \V. Peck. Commission
er General of the United States, in regard
jto the California- exhibit. Tt was the
! unanimous opinion of the State Commis-
J sloners to use all necessary means to se-
I cure a segregated exhibit.
Without much waste of time the Com
missioners voted that one of their own
body should go on the mission, though
i each one of the three was reluctant to
make the trip. Runyon was finally per
suaded to make the journey, and ht
i will leave for Chicago on Friday. Fer
| dlnand W. Peck has been telegraphed of
the action of the State Commission, and
[ an interview with Runyon is requested.
| The sole purpose of the trip is to secure
; a separate space for our exhibits, so that
: the entire contribution from California
j may appear by itself and have some char
acteristic and distinguishing quality.
Major Truman was appointed as a
committee of one to confer with the sec
| retary of the board of managers of the
Mechanics' Institute Exposition and
I Chairman Filcher of thÂ£ Board of Trade

SWIFT YACHTS WILL
RACE FOR PENNANTS
The annual Corinthian regatta to be
held to-day over the channel course will
be largely attended by lovers of yacht-
Ing. The Californias having troublesâ
that is to say, a regattaâ of their own,
will not be able to be present. The South
Bays and Son Franciscos will cruise to
the city front to witness the racing,
which bids fair to be exciting. At 11:40
a. m. one long whistle from the regatta
committee's tug will serve as a signal to
the yachts to get ready. The start will
be of the one-gun variety. At 11:45 live
whistles will be the signal for yachts of
the twenty-foot class to start; at 12 noon
four whistles will be the starting signal
for yachts of the twenty-five-foot class;
three whistles at 12:15 p. m. will be the
signal for the thirty-foot class; two whis
tles at 12:30 p. m. will be the signal for
the thirty-six-footers, and one whistle at
12:45 p. m. will start the yachts of Class 1.
The time of all yachts will be taken from
the starting signal of the class. Yachts
of the twenty-foot class are allowed to
carry a crew of three, those of the fcsven
ty-flve-foot class a crew of five, those of
the thirty-foot class a crew of six, those
of the thirty-six-foot class a crew of
eight and those of Class 1 a crew of nine,
all to be amateurs. The regatta commit
tee's tug will lie alongside the seawall nt
a point 300 feet to the east of the Cus
toms Officers' barge office at the foot of
Taylor street. A red ball will be hoisted
thereon when the whistles of each class
begin, and will remain hoisted for live
minutes.
The course for the twenty-foot class
will be from an imaginary line drawn
from the seawall to a stakehoat an
chored l"t H| feet offshore, to and around
Presidio Shoal buoy, leaving it on the
port side; thence back across the start
ing line. The twenty-five-footers, after
rounding Presidio Shoal buoy, will sail
to and around Blossom Rock buoy; thence
due north 2% miles to a stakeboat; thence
to the starting line. The thirty-footers,
thirty-six-footers and Class 1, after
rounding the stakeboat just mentioned,
will proceed to and around Presidio Sho:U
buoy, keeping Alcatraz on the starboard
side; thence home across the starting
line.
The class-flag regatta of the California
Yacht Club will be sailed to-day over the
usual course, starting across an imag
inary line drawn from the southerly pier
head of the narrow-gauge mole to a
stakeboat anchored 100 yards to the
south; thence to and around Blossom Rock
buoy: thence to and around the can buoy
of the Union Iron Works; thence to the
finish across an imaginary line drawn
from the southerly pierhead to a stake
boat anchored 100 y;irds due west. The
course is officially reckoned at ten nauti
cal miles. The start will be of the one
gun kind, a preparatory gun being fired
at 1 i). m. Yachts of Class 1 will start
on gun-tire at 1:05 p. m., those of Class
2 at 1:15 ]>. m., and those of Classes :; and
4 at I; 30 p. m. A red flag will fly as :i
signal for Class 1. a white flag as a sig
nal tor Class 2 and a blue flag as a signal
tor Classes :; and I. At Blossom Hock
buoy, which is also one of the marks in
tlie Corinthian course, the California
yachts will yield the right of way to the
Corinthian craft.
The Oakland Canoe club will keep

E. W. RUNYON, President of the Paris Com
mission.
in regard to their displays.
At his own suggestion the commission
required a bond from Secretary Gasklll
in the sum of $f>ooo as a security for the
faithful performance of his duties. The
bonds of the, three Commissioners to the
State have been executed and will be de
posited with the Governor in a few days.
The commission will meet again this
morning.
Major Bon C. Truman arrived from l,ns
Angeles early yesterday morning and was
greeted by his many old-time friends and
acquaintances. Immediately after the
business of the commission was trans
acted he went .to the yellow building to
visit W. H. Mills, with whom he was once

ing two straight games to Watsonville,
arrived in town yesterday and went into
practice at Recreation Park, where they
will meet the Friscos this afternoon in a
regular championship game commencing
at 2:30 o'clock. Although the Sacramen
tos look like a strong aggregation on pa
per and playing fast ball, they have been
slowly falling behind in the raceâ a cir
cumstance which they attribute solely to
hard luck. To-day's game will introduce
Pitcher Harvey to the local fans. He
has not yet appeared this season on the

CHILHOOD'S
TRIBUTE TO THE
NATION'S DEAD
Memorial Day in the
Schools.
SOME INTERESTINGEXERCISES
VABIED PROGRAMMES TO CELE
BRATE THE DAY.
Recitations, Songs and Essays to
Commemorate the Heroes and
the Deeds That Gave
Them Fame.
The schools are celebrating Memorial
day in their own way. There have been
patriotic exercises and there have been
mourning ceremonies, but in general the
teachers have tried to make the occasion
; one of instruction. There is so much about
I the day that appeals to the youngster
j outside of the ceremonies of strewing- j
' Dowers and visiting the graves that it
furnishes a fruitful subject for the teach
| er's art and full advantage is taken of it.
In every school there was some mention
of the theory that put the holiday upon
the calendar, and in many of the schools
I exercises were held, the programmes in-
Hu.ling everything from the national an
tliom, "The Star Spangled Banixer," to the
mournful lines of "The Blue and the
Gray." In some schools the flag was un
furled and its praises were sung; in
others, flowers were brought and the spirit
of the dead held sway; in all some one
said something of the heroes who had
made a mark upon the year and whose
deeds had made possible the unity of the
States.
In the Harrison School the following
programme was well rendered:
"Flag Salute," school; song. "Star
Spangled Banner."' school; recitation, "O.

four girls of school; dance. Highland fling

closing song. "Vesper Hymn," school.
At the Le Conte School the day was not
forgotten. An excellent programme had
been prepared, and before an audience
that filled the schoolrooms it was gone
through with all the enthusiasm and pat
riotism the children's minds could bring
to it.
"The Star-spangled Banner," "Old
Glory," "Mount Vernon Bells." "Lincoln
Song." "Our Flag Forever," "Tenting on
the Old Camp Ground," "Dewey Song"
and "America" were sung by the pupils
with much spirit. Each class was rep
resented by some more or less spectacular
piece, and all were of both patriotic and
memorial interest.
The leading ones were "Children's Of
ferings," by Miss Chase's class; "T'nion
of the Red. White and Blue," by Mrs.
Newhall'a class; "Historical Memorial
Day," by Miss Wolf's and Miss Cassi
dy"s classes; "Memory Day Flowers." by
Miss Van Den Bergh's class: "Bring
Flowers for Our Soldiers' Graves," by
Miss Webster's class; "Soldiers' Day."
by Miss Featherly's class, arrd a patriotic
exercise by Miss Stebblns' class. The pat
rons and friends of-the school were much
pleased with the efforts of the pupils.
No Money to Feed Jurors.
Judges Cook and Dunne adjourned court
yesterday until Wednesday on account of
a lack of money to Â£eed jurors, who may
happen to be deliberating on a verdict
when the meal hours arrive. Judge Law
lor, however, went on with his work.
Judge Lawlor said that he did not be
lieve in courts taking arbitrary positions,
and said that he would accommodate the
business of his court to the present con
dition "Criminals have the same right
to be tried that jurors have to eat." said
Judge Lawlor, "and I will see that all
are accommodated. Jurors will be dis
missed in time that they may ea; in their
homes and the work will continue with
but little delay." _
