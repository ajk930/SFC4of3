ALAMEPA. Jan. 31.â Hoodoo en

gauÃf tmin which connects with
the 4:40 boat from San Fran<-is<-n,
jumped the track on Enclnal
avenue, near First avenue, and as a re
sult of the accident Engineer H. H.
Jonaf is dead and Fireman E. F. Colson
Is. hovering between life and death. The
â  train -consisted of dent cars, full to
overflowing with passengers, returning
home. Fortunately no further casual
ties than thopÂ«-> mentioned occurred.

the unfortunate engineer died at
Fabiola Hospital about 1:30 this morn

Firrman Colson is married and re
sides at 3105 Encinal avenue.
The smoking car next to the engine
left the track and the lnmafeH received
a shaking up and a bad fright. B.
Ghilieri, a car cleaner, who lives at 2112
Ban Antonio avenue, was thrown over
a seat and jarred severely, but not in
jured.
The accident occurred just after the
train left the trestle south of the oil
works at a point about 200 yards west
of Second avenue station. At the lo
.cality there are double tracks connect
ed by a spring switch. The railroad
t men advance the theory that the disas
ter was caused by a defect in the
pwitch. The train was running on the
northerly track, with the tender ahead
of the engine.
The San Francisco Call.
- Just as it reached the switch the
tender shot over toward the southerly
tracks. The engine, which was run
ning at a lively speed, kept on the main
line for about 100 feet, when the trucks
left the* track, throwing the end of the
engine nearest the fmoker in the di
rection of the sidewalk. In another in
stant it rolled over on its side, while
the smoker was thrown sideways par
tially on top of it. The tender stood on
end and fell to the south side of the
street.
Engineer Jonas was pinioned beneath
the boiler and was enveloped by blis
tering steam which enshrouded the
Wreck. Hf suffered in that position for
half an hour before the dismantled lo
comotive could be lifted sufficiently to
release him. He did not lose conscious
ness, and with extraordinary fortitude
directed the work of the wreckers who,
with jackscrews and levers, were en
deavoring to get him out of the hiss
ing, scalding torment which was slowly
torturing him to death. Finally, when
he was released, and realizing that his
Injuries might be fatal, he asked first
that his family be taken care of and
his next words were:
"I hope none of the passengers Is
hurt." Then his overtaxed nerves col
lapsed and he sank into a semi-coma
tose condition.
The wounded engineer was taken to
the home of George B. Okerlund, near
the scene of the wreck. His Injuries are
a broken leg and external and internal
burns. whl<*n eventually caused death.
He was literally cooked from head to
foot while imprisoned beneath his en
gine and his lungs are also scalded by
Inhaling steam.
Fireman Colson Is as badly burned
externally, but he has no broken limbs
and did not inhale any steam. He has
an even chance for recovery. The two
wounded men were taken In an ambu
lance to Fablola Hospital at 9 o'clock
last evening. Drs. Lubbock and Keys,
who dressed their wounds, accompanied
thorn. Mrs. Colson also went to the
hospital to remain with her husband.
Mrs. Jonas was so shocked that she is
all but prostrated and was obliged to
remain at her home, where sympathetic
friends are giving her every care.
Among the passengers in the wreck
ed smoker were R. E. Parr, a commer
cial traveler, residing at 1193 Park ave
nue: W. W. Ooggin, 1719 Santa Clara
n venue; P. A. Kearney of the San
Francisco Mint. wHose home is at 2125
Ran Antonio avenue, and E. S. Clark,
a jeweler, of 2525 Central avenue. These
gentlemen agree in the opinion that
the smoker left the track a moment
after passing the switch.
THE TENDER TURNED
A SOMERSAULT

the train, as quickly as possible noti
fied Road Master R. W. Baxter, and a
wrecking train was immediately dis
patched to clear the wreck. Before the
wreckers arrived every effort was made
to release Engineer Jonas, but there
were no adequate appliances at hand,
and he continued to suffer in sight of
hundreds of nerve-wracked passengers
until the wreckers got heavy jack
screws under the engine and raised it
up.
When the tender left the track Jonas
stuck to his post and set the air brakes,
but the momentum was too great, and,
after jolting and careening for a hun
dred feet, the tender turned a complete
somersault and the engine tumbled
over in the opposite direction. The en
gineer fell with the cab and was caught
by the rear of the boiler across his legs.
Fireman Colson attempted to jump
when the engine was in the air and was
also caught in the wreck, but was able
to pull himself out. He was terribly
scalded, but managed to get up and
walk to the curb, where he sank down
unconscious.
HELPED RELEASE
THE ENGINEER
Martin Kaney, a fireman on the
steamer Newark, was one of the first
to reach the stricken engineer. In an
interview he said he was seated in the
first coach, and when he recovered from
the shock he hurried forward to the
overturned locomotive and climbed over
the cab and found Jonas pinio-ned at
his post. Pausing a moment to comfort
his friend he ran back some hundred
yards and obtained a jackscrew, which
was used to advantage In releasing the
injured man.
"While the willing volunteers strug
gled with the weighty mass of steel,"
he said, "Jonas directed their efforts,
cautioning them to be careful and beg
ging those he recognized in his semi
conscious condition to look out for his
family.
"While he was suffering agony from
the numerous burns he had received
from the scalding water his one thought
was for the safety of his passengers,
and he repeatedly asked how they had
fared. When told they had escaped
with a shaking up he was greatly re
lieved."
CHOPPED THE CAB
TO RESCUE JONAS
L. Li. Schuler, Frank Thompson and
Henry Burn, employes in the brewery
near the scene of the wreck, were the
first persons to reach the engine. They
saw the tender bouncing In a different
Locomotive and Tender a Wreck, the En
gineer Dead and the Fireman Badly

direction from the engine and when the
crash came they seized axes and ran
to do rescue work. These men saw the
peril which hung over Engineer Jonas
and without regard to the blinding,
suffocating steam they began chopping
away the cab to get at the suffering
man. With mighty and rapid strokes
they sent splinters sailing across the
street and in less time than it takes to
tell it they had all the wood work
cleared away.. Then they discovered
that nothing could be done to release
the poor man until hoisting appliances
were secured.
- One jackÃcrew was obtained, but it
was not sufficient to remove the mass
of hot steel under which Jonas was be
ing parboiled and roasted at the same
time. By this time hundreds of agitated
men and women were running about
frantically calling for some one to re
lease the engineer, but nothing could
be done. Hundreds of passengers who
had been shaken out of their wits by
the shock forgot their fright and vain
ly endeavored to assist in the work of
rescue.
Finally the relief train arrived. Then
Jonas' great courage and nerve were
shown. When the men set about to ad
just the lifting machines, he, in an al
most inarticulate voice, told them
where to place the jackscrews, giving
explicit directions how he was held
down. When success was apparent and
the boiler began to rise, slowly, then
more rapidly as the anxious laborers
bent all their strength on the levers, a
sound, half cheer, half moan, showed
the intense tension on the nerves of the
spectators. In another instant Jonas
was pulled from the jaws of death and
carried into tho nearest house. Doc
tors were at hand and everything possi
ble was done to save his life and alle
viate his agony.
CROWDS WATCH THE
WRECKERS AT WORK
Traffic was suspended on the narrow
gauge for two hours, in which time the
workmen succeeded in clearing the
south track so trains might pass. A
large crowd gathered to watch the work
Of removing the demolished engine; the
people remained until late at night.
When the ambulance came to take the
wounded engineer and fireman to the
hospital several hundred people surged
about the vehicle and when Jonas was
carried out of the house, groaning piti
fully, though every effort was exerted
to handle him gently, a sympathetic
murmur was heard from all sides. This
scene was repeated when Fireman Col-
Bon was removed from the house next
door. He was followed by his weeping
wife. She wished to go with him, but
there was no room in the ambulance so
a kind-hearted neighbor hitched up his
horse and took her in a buggy to the
Fabiola, where she sat In agony beside
her pain-ton ured husband.
MRS. JONAS PROUD
OF HER HUSBAND
Seated in her comfortable home at
1342 High street, the wife of the un
fortunate engineer waited for tidings
from the bedside of her husband. She
saw him for a mome ;t after he had
been extricated from his perilous po
sition and was taken home by friends.
Innumerable acquaintances of the fam
ily poured in immediately after the
news of the accident to express their
regrets and to cheer her. Surrounded
by her three children, Stanley, a boy of
14; Alice, a sweet little maid of 9, and
with a babe in arms, she listened to the
sympathy of her friends. The news of
her husband's ultimate recovery did a
great deal toward dispelling her anxiety
and she sent her little ones to bed.
Mrs. Jonas is proud of her husband
and has the utmost confidence in him.
At no time in his long experience as a
locomotive engineer has she feared he
would be injured, well knowing his
coolness and carefulness.
In speaking of Mr. Jonas, she said
he was about 46 years old and had han
dled a throttle for nearly half that
period without a mishap. For eighteen
years he has hauled trains over the
narrow gauge line and during that long
period has never been away from his
duties more than ten days. She spoke
of his great popularity in Alameda
County and the confidence every one
felt when they knew he was guiding
the swift moving train through the
county.
Mrs. Jonas also stated that her hus
band had never been injured previous
to this catastrophe. "The nearest he
came to being hurt," she said, "was
while firing for E. L. Reese, many years
ago. He was working on a mountain
division and the engine crashed into a
boulder, throwing wood on top of him.
A few bruises were all he received."
The lady also told of a similar inci
dent wherein he fortunately escaped
injury.
The first news she received of the
accident that befell her husband to
night was when a strange lady called
and told her that there was a little ac
cident, and she immediately surmised
that her husband was hurt. The ar
rival of her mother, who was a pas
senger on the train and who was badly
shaken up by the derailment, prevent
ed her from hurrying to her husband's
side.
While speaking of the injured engi
neer's love for his children and the de
light he took in his home-life, Mrs.
Jonas could not restrain her tears. She
expressed a hope that when her hus
band recovered he would no longer fol
low his dangerous calling, but she re
marked that, like all railroad men, he
would not give up the exciting work.
NUMBER NINETEEN
THE HOODOO ENGINE
No. 19 has long been known as the
hoodoo engine of the narrow gauge line.
It was always getting out of repair,
breaking an eccentric, dropping a bolt
or doing some other malign thing
which gave it a hard name among all
the railroad workmen.
Six months ago No. 19 ran off the
trestle at Alameda Point, and Fireman
Hickey was killed and Engineer Bald
win so badly scalded that he was laid
up for many months.
Now to this unenviable record is
added the death of brave Jonas. As
the engine lies wrecked on the Alameda
street it seems extremely probable that
the last bloody incident in its history
is now written. The cab lies in splin
ters all over the street: the smokestack
rests against the fence, and with her
working parts twisted and bent it is not
at all likely she will ever run again.
She will find a dishonored grave In the
junk pile.
BURNS REACHED
THE LIMIT OF
HIS STRENGTH
All His Efforts Fail to Pull One More Vote
to Him.
A "HAS BEEN" IN GENERALSHIP NOW
Fat-litted and Clumsy Schemes Worked That Not Only Fail
of Their Object but Serve to Bring Their
Author Into Disrepute as a
Leader.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 31.â Three ballots in joint
assembly to-day registered ro change
in the Senatorial situation. The Grant
men are still solid. General Barnes 1
eleven immortals are as steady and
confident as ever. Bulla's thirteen
stand together and Burns is holding his
twenty-five supporters. The wiies have
been pulled by the colonel to bring to
Sacramento all the scattering local in
fluences that can be brought to bear to
T'-rsuade Republican Senators and As
semblymen to enter a caucus to settle
the Senatorrhip.
The Call is not making an error In
predicting that Burns has practically
reached the limit of his strengm in this
Senatorial struggle. Two weeks ago j
the colonel might have named the next
Senator, but he has since wasted his
strength and displayed his weakness in
a selfish and hopeless struggle to gain
a place for himself in the United States
Senate. Since the colonel is making
such a great effort to line up Repub
lican County Committees to aid his
cause it is well to refresh the memory
of California's Republicans with the
truth that Burns' disloyalty to the Re
publican party gave to California the
Democratic Legislature of 1893 which
elected Stephen White to the Senate.
As a political boss in San Francisco he
went to the front as a rank non-parti
san. In every sure Republican district
he put up a Republican non-partisan
candidate to divide the Republican vote
and in the safe Democratic districts he
did not interfere. He cast the weight
of his influence then to divide the Re
publican party and give the Legislature
to the Democrats. He is now asking
the support of the Republican County
Committees to help him get a dark
lantern caucus.
The touts have again deferred the
date for the display of Burns' in
creased strength. Last Saturday they
designated Wednesday as the day of
the uprising of the Burns hosts. To
night Friday is mentioned as the day
for the grand rally to Burns of the
members who are staked out in the
camps of Barnes, Bulla and Grant. No
particular Friday is mentioned, so one
may infer that it will be the first Fri
day after the adjournment of the
Legislature.
The announcement of the death of
Thomas Reynolds in San Francisco
caused some commotion in the camp of
Colonel Burns. Reynolds was former
ly County Clerk of San Francisco.
When Burns was elected Secretary of
State in 1879 Reynolds was called to
Sacramento to take the chief deputy
ship in the office of the colonel. What
occurred in the partnership of Burns
and Reynolds is written in the court
records of this State. Each charged
the other with wasfing, squandering
and stealing the public money of the
State. Years later Burns came back
from Mexico rich, according to com
mon report, but he never made good
to the taxpayers of California the
money stolen in his office and for which
he was directly responsible. Now he
asks to be elected to the high and hon
orable office of United States Senator.
Immediately after the announcement
of the first ballot in joint convention
to-day the touts demanded that a sec
ond ballot be taken. At first It was
fancied that the colonel had taken in
another deserter and was about to
parade him for moral effect, as Wright
was paraded, but after the second and
the third ballots were taken the Burns
scheme was exposed. It was found to
be nothing more than a fat-witted ef
fort to interrupt the regular routine
JOHNSON CONVICTED
AS A MALICIOUS LIAR
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 31.âAssem
blyman Grove L. Johnson has failed to produce a copy of The
Call in which there appears the charge, whether direct, indirect or
intimated, that all of the twenty -five men who are voting for
Dan Burns for Senator were bought to do so. He therefore
stands convicted of being a malicious liar who has insulted the
members of the Assembly by taking advantage of the honorable
privileges of that body by giving utterance to a deliberate false
hood for the purpose of influencing the minds of his associates.
This is not the first offense charged against Johnson, and it
is not the first of which ne has been guilty. Once upon a time he,
knowing full well that evasion and falsehood would not avail him,
confessed the commission of a crime. That crime was forgery.
That was years ago.
His later career is a part of the infamous history of Califor
nia's thralldom under the yoke of the giant corporation which
claims him as its willing tool. Such is the man who seeks by
falsehood to influence the members of that * onorable body which
his presence fails to honor.

claim a caucus on the ground that the
Senatorial" contest was blocking the
wheels of legislation. â¢
A few more clumsy efforts like the
one put forward to-day may compel the
organization of the anti-Burns party in
the Legislature. Men who have been
active in Burns' fight reluctantly ad
mit that the colonel is not displaying
that superior generalship which was
expected of him by the touts when he
opened the campaign in this city. In
the light of events it is now clear to
the blindest partisans of the colonel
that he made a grievous mistake in
forcing Wright's hand. He will embit
ter the Legislature against him if hl9
touts attempt to interfere with the reg
ular business of considering bills.
The touts are saying to-night: "The
colonel gives out the word that he can
not lose." There is some truth in this
assertion. The colonel cannot lose
what he does not possess, but the le
publican party can lose and the ritate
can lose a representative in the upper
house of Congress.

BURNS MAY SPRING
REYNOLDS' CONFESSION
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 31.â The story goes to
night among the touts that there will
be found in the papers of Thomas H.
Reynolds, deceased, a confession excul
pating D. M. Burns from any complic
ity in the theft of public funds when
the latter was Secretary of State. This
is not the first time that the confession
has been mentioned. It is known to
many of the Masonic fraternity that
Reynolds received during his long ill
ness sums of money from Burns. In
one contribution Burns gave Reynolds
$500. It is further known that Pacific
Lodge of San Francisco contributed to
Reynolds' support for fifteen years.
It makes no difference now what kind
of a deathbed confession may be
brought forward to vindicate Burns,
because the court records show that D.
M. Burns testified on the witness stand
that he (Burns) falsified the records of
his own office to conceal the defalca
tion. The falsification of public rec
ords is as great a crime as the mis
appropriation of public money.
The people of this State need not be
surprised if the Mexican colonel should
now produce a certificate of character
obtained from Reynolds on his death- â 
bed. This would be in keeping with the
past career of the colonel in this State
and in Mexico. Besides the facts brought
out during the trial showed that the
stealings in the Secretary of State's de
partment were carried on for seven
months after Reynolds left the office.

INCIDENTS OF THE DAY AT SACRAMENTO.
DICKINSON WANTS NEW
HARBOR COMMISSIONERS
â f CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRAMENTO, Jan. 31.â A Democratic
O Legislature and ; Democratic Governor in the year 1883 legislated out of
â¦ office the Republican Board of Harbor Commissioners of, the City and
T County of San Francisco. i
q Now Senator Dickinson of San r'rancisco proposes t^ even up the
+ score. He wants the present Democratic Board of Harbor Commission
Â© ers legislated out of office and he introduced a bill on the Senate to
> day ..hich will have that effect.
O Senator Dickinson's bill creates a board of five Harbor CommiÃsion
Â£ ers instead of three, as at present. They are to be named by the Gov
+ Â«rnor and , n firmed by the Senate. The first oommiss' -.- is to hold
Â© office as follows: One for one year, one for two -ears, two for three
q yearss and one fo: four years. Put after the terms of the appointees
â¢â¦ for the i.. board :iava expired the term of future appointees is for

Â© journmont sine die of the Legislature. But in case the Senate does
not confirm, the Governor's appointees shall hold over until the next

O The bill chai Â»es no salaries and cuts off no patronage. It simply
-f eliminates a Democratic Bcford of Harbor Commissioners and opens the'
O way for the Governor to name a Rej Ã¼bllcan board.
Senator Dickinson frankly admits the purpose of his measure, and
Â® adds that the present Board of Harbor Commissioners in ULu Francisco
q ought to be ousted.
the salaries of the twelve Superior Judges
of the city will be raised from $-1000 to
$5000 per year. It was by a â¢ narrow
margin, however, that a clause was
added to the Curtin bill, which was under
iSEion on second reading, making this
increase. The vote was 15 to 14.
ator Curtin had a bill increasing the
Balary of the Superior Judge of Tuolumne
County to $3500 per annum.
An amendment was proposed to increase
the salary of the San Francisco Judges to
$5000, and upon thi3 amendment the light
whh made.
The San Francisco Senatorial delegation
Is seldom united on any proposition, hut
upon this it stood as a unit. Democratic
and Republican Senators vied with each
other in, securing votes for the amend
ment.
Senator Davis nf . Amador County and
Senator Simpson of Los Angeles were the
only two interior Senators who talked in
favor of' the amendment.
Senators Wolfe, Braunhart, Bettman
and Stratton. who offered the amendment,
nil spoke in favor of it, .on the plea that
$5000 was not too' large a salary for a man
competent to serve on the Superior bench
of San Francisco, but, on the other hand,
it was only fair and equitable compensa
tion for the service rendered by an honest
man acting in the high capacity he did. â 
Senator Bulla opposed the amendment
of natcr Stratton, and when the vote
was taken it carried, receiving 15 ayes to
14 noes.
The bill was then advanced to ' third
reading.
PATRONAGE CAUSES
AN ASSEMBLY ROW
Johnson, Valentine and Wright
Monopolize the Good
Things.
'â ALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 31.â A royv of ample pro
portions nearly broke up the Assembly
patronage caucus this afternoon. As it
is Grove L. Johnson, Valentine of Los
Angeles and Howard E. Wright are
going to have a whole lot of squaring
to do during the next week.
The bill that killed off Belshaw's anti
attache law let the bars down in front
of the horde of job chasers that has
been here since this session opened, and
upon the verbal authority given by
Howard Wright before he ceased to be
Speaker a number of the members why
had been made chairmen of committees
went ahead and put their clerks at
work.
Johnson, as chairman of the Judi
ciary Committee, attached to himself a
Berseant-at-arms, clerk and stenog
rapher. Valentine oÂ£ the Ways and
Means Committee did the same thing.
Sp< aker Wright doled out jobs right
and left, but from all accounts he
charged them up to members on the
Hoar.
Under the new bill the patronage
pro rata was $ti, but when the matter
was brought up in caucus to-day it was
discovered that Grove L. Johnson had
gone the whole ;s wine and appointed $14
worth of patronage. Valentine was
with him, and as the heads of the two
must Important committees in the As
sembly they were able to make their
demands good. The other members on
the floor had to give way, and as a re
sult of it two or three eo-mmittee clerks
lost their jobs. Even Dibble was frozen
out. He haU appointed Ed Smith and
w. C. Gyrey t" jobs at thy clerks' desk,
and by the deal of to-day he was forced
to give up both of them. The Judge
was so- mad when he left the caucus
chamber he failed to recognize his best
friends.
Wright made a bold bluff, but was
promptly called down. He had $14
worth of appointments he wanted rati
fied and had the nerve to ask for $1
more. He was allowed the original
amount, but his $4 amendment was not
adopted.
After an hour and a half of warm
squabbling the matter resolved itself

TO CONTROL GRASPING
GAS AND WATER COMPANIES
[ Sena or Feeney Introduces Three Bills
That Will Greatly Benefit
The Public.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 31.â Senator Feeney of
San Francisfco is introducing some very
good bills affecting gas and water com
panies, but the trouble is that some of
them are worded in language which
makes the intent and purpose of the
measures a trifle dense. Still Senator
Feeney seems to be on the right track.
To-day he introduced three bills in
the Senate touching gas and water
companies which are of particular im-.
portance to the residents of San Fran
cisco as well as those of every other
city in the State.
One provides that In case an appli
cant whoee building Is not more than
100' feet distant' from any main of the

cant of all money due the comDany
from him, the corporation must supply
the gas for the said applicant. All con
tracts for the deposit of money as se
curity for gas meters are void, and any
corporation holding such deposits is re
quired to return them on demand. A
failure to return the deposit when de
manded means a verdict of -$100 to the
paTty demanding a return of his de
posit, with costs, interest and damages.
Another bill of Senator Feeney's pro
vides that no company shall in the fu
ture manufacture water gas or force
air through mains which are being used
to supply illuminating gas. A viola
tion of the act is punishable by a fine
of $100 and each day's continuance
shall constitute a separate offense.
The third bill introduced by Senator
Feeney to-day provides that all water
meters shall be so adjusted as to per
mit of the meters being examined at
any time, and they will then Indicate
the amount of water used to the date
â¢of examination. A corporation not
complying with this act cannot collect
a water tax from the party it refuses
to furnish with the open meter, nor can
it cut off his water supply.
All three bills have gone to the com
: mittee on corporations.

Pertinent Joint Resold

MENTO, Jan. 31.â The Senate to-day.
by an almost unanimous vote, adopted
the following Joint resolution, which is
of particular interest to all readers who
have friends or relatives in the First
Regiment of California Volunteers:
Whereas, The First Regiment of Cali
fornia Infantry of United States Volun
teers were the first troops to leave the
United States for a foreign port during
the war with Spain, having left San Fran
cisco on May 25. 1898, and have been con
tinually in service away from home longer
than any other volunteer regiment; and
whereas, many of the men who volun
teered are detained in the service in a
tropical climate, with danger to their
health, and at a great sacrifice to their
personal interests; and wjiereas, the said
First Regiment of California Volunteers
have conducted themselves during the
late war in a manner highly creditable to
their patriotism and bravery; therefore
be it '
Resolved. That our Senators in Congress
bo Instructed and our Representatives re
quested that when, in the opinion of the
military authorities, troops can be spared
from operations in the Philippines they
use their best efforts that our boys be
of the first to return to their homes and
families.

ell opposed the, res.ohitio_n upon tbe
ground that it would not be the proper
thing for the State to interfere with
the military arm of the Federal Gov
ernment.
Boyce and Smith also opposed the
resolution on the ground that other
California regiments desired to go to
Manila, but had been denied the privi
lege and made to give way to the First
Regiment.
Senator Braunhart spoke at length
in favor of the bill, and attacked the
War Department for the way it had
treated soldiers in the recent war.
Senator Shortridge said that he had
"first opposed the resolution, afterward
favored it, and at the time of speaking
he was on the fence." He asked that
tho resolution be re-read, and an
nounced that he was in favor of -it.
Senator Smith was opposed to the
resolution if it In any May reflected
upon the administration of President
McKinley.
Then the resolution as printed above
was adopted, Senator Davis having of
fered an amendment which made it ac
ceptable to all.
THE SHEEP TAX BILL
CONTAINS A JOKER
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 31.â The general county
government act, introduced in the As
sembly by O. H. Huber, and known as
Assembly bill No. 3b3, contains a Joker.
It was supposed that the bill was an
exact reprdouction of the present county
government act. It was put in that
shape so that it could be amended in com
mittee to suit the interests of each county
in the State.
But the bill as introduced is not a re
production of the present law, which
gives to the Boards of Supervisors in each
county the power to fix the license tax
to be placed on sheep raising, and pastur
ing at the sum they consider to be just
and right for the damage done to the
roads and forests by the sheep. In some
ASSEMBLYMAN DALE RESUMES HIS SEAT.
cases the license Is 4 cents per head now
and in others 6 and 7 cents per head, ac
cording to the damage the herds do. Now
If Assembly bill 363 was a reproduction
of the present county government law it
would contain a clause to the above ef
fect, but instead of that on page 20, line
407, of the bill commences a clause read
ing: . â  â¢
' But no. license tax on the business of
raising, pasturing, grazing, or herding
sheep shall exceed the sum. of 2 cents per
annum per head and no license tax
shall be imposed on unweaned lambs."
This appears in section 25 of the act and
refers to powers of Boards of Supervisors
to put a license tax on certain industries.
It is not a part of the present 'aw and
in that respect is a misrepresentation.-
STATE WILL PAY FOR
DUTCH FLAT FIRES
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 31.-The Assembly Commit
tee on Claims met this afternoon and took
up the consideration of the claims of the
people of Dutch Flat, who lost consider
able property through the act of a ue
mented youth named Wedgewood, who
had a mania for burning buildings.
Wedgewood, it is claimed, was released
from the Napa Insane Asylum without
being properly-discharged according to
law, and the people of Dutch Flat hold
the State responsible for the acts of the
boy. The claims were vested in seven
billsâ numbers 76, 77. 78, la, 80. 81 and 82.
Bill 76 was the claim of the Dutch Flat
School District for $4000. This was cut
down to $3000 and reported favorably
upon. Bill 77 went through for the en
tire amount, as did also bills 78 and 79.
Bill 80, the claim of Mrs. J. Uren for $1000
was made to read $850. Bill 81, of W. B.
Sowden, was cut from $500 to. $200. BJU 82
that of Patrick Carroll, was cut from $300
to $150.
The other bills passed favorably upon
by the committee were 279, 67 and 26. Bill
279 was the claim of Major Jose Ramon
Pico for $8111 15, which he claims he ex
pended In equipping and organizing two
companies at the time of the War of the
Rebe' ion. Bill 67 was the claim of Clem

case in which he appeared for the State.
Bill 2G was for the claim of William Sulli-
TO ADVOCATE
THE ELECTION
OF I.M. SCOTT
Call for a Merchants'
Mass Meeting.
TIRED OF BURNS' TACTICS
ALAMEDA COUNTY BEPUBLI
CANS HAVE TAKEN ACTION.
Their Members of the Legislature
Petitioned to Work for the
Election of the Big
Shipbuilder.
Friends of Irving M. Scott are striv
ing to bring to bear every reputable
influence in behalf of that erentleman's
candidacy for the United States Sen
ate. A petition was in circulation
among the down town business men
yesterday, calling for a mass meeting
of merchants for this evening to urge'
the members of the Legislature to con
centrate upon Mr. Scott. His friends
argue that the other candidates have
been struggling now for three weeks
without one of them having made any
gain; that the existing deadlock bids
fair to continue throughout the session,
with the result that California will be
left with only one member of the upper
house for the next two years â the most
critical period in the history of thf
State. The other candidates having
failed, after all this time, to make any
showing beyond the strength they de
veloped at the start, it is time for them
now, in the best interests of the State
and of the party, to turn their strength
to Mr. Scott, he being the only man on
whom all factions could unite.
The idea of holding a mass-meeting
in Mr. Scott's interest seems to have
found favor with many prominent busi
ness men, and it is hoped to have at
least 100 signatures to the petition by
the close of business hours to-day. It
is- the intention to have a meeting of
the signers to-night, at which the Re
publican members of the San Fran
cisco delegation will be called upon. to
fall in line for the big shipbuilder, and
the legislators from other parts of the
State will also be urged to give him
their allegiance;
Those who have the matter in charge
say the meeting will be representative
of the very best interests in the com
munity, and will carry such- weight
that the legislators will not care to ig
nore it.
Alameda County, too, Is falling into
line for Scott. Influential Republicans
on the other side of the bay have grown
tired of the long wrangle, and they now
call upon their representatives in the
Legislature to do what they can to put
an end to it. Yesterday the following
petition, signed by fifty well known
business men of Oakland and Berkeley,
was forwarded to the Alameda County
delegation at Sacramento:
"January 30, 1899.â We, the under
signed Republicans of Alameda County,
in the interest of good government,
urge your earnest support in the nomi
nation of Hon. Irving M. Scott for
United States Senator."
The candidacy of Dan Burns seems
to have aroused the decent element in
all sections, and his determination to
prevent ap election, if he cannot be the
choice, has had the effect of .setting on
foot the apparent movement to save the
State from the lastin" disgrace of
Burns.

CONREY WANTS TO
EXTEND PATERNALISM
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 31.â Assemblyman Conrey
of Los Angeles wants to establish in
eveTy county in the State what he Is
pleased to call "truant schools." What
the bill he has introduced will really ac
complish is the rehabilitation in every
county that will stand for it of the old
Industrial School, the "Ref" that flour
ished on the Ingleside road in San Fran
cisco during the earlier and palmier days
of Chris Buckley's regime.
Mr. Conrey's bill gives authority to
county school boards to either buy or rent
buildings and grounds, which shall be set
aside and used solely as a place for the
incarceration of youths of both sexes, be
tween the ages of 6 and 16 years, who
shall be adjudged to be truants. The bill
classes as truants not only the pupil who
habitually plays "hookey," but as well
tho6e who are insubordinate, refractory
and of general poor deportment.
These truants are amenable to arrest
by a truant officer, whose position is cre
ated by the bill, and upon arrest shall be
taken before a committing magistrate
and either released on bonds or commit
ted to the truant school for the rest of
the school year.
The. school may file execution upon the
child's estate or upon the estate of its
parents for the cost of maintenance dur
ing the period of its incarceration.
Inmates may be paroled or released at
any time and no child convicted of a fel
ony, or immoral offense shall be received

GRANT MEN WILL

A Steering Committee Will
Hold the Legislators on
Vital Votes.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 31. â The twenty-one
legislators who are voting for U. S.
Grant in the Assembly on every joint
ballot are not satisfied with the results
they effect when questions have come
up which do not and have not directly
involved the Senatorial problem. While
they have all stood as a solid phalanx
on the proposition of voting for Mr.
Grant on every joint ballot, still on
other questions not involving directly
the Senatorial question theyhave nev
er at any time voted as a unit.
The object of the meeting to-night
was to bring about a better organiza
tion so that on an important matter,
indirectly having some bearing upon
the Senatorial question, they will be
able to castt twenty-one votes for or
against it, as it may affect their inter r
.eStS. -' ' } â â ' .' . 'â¢' .';â¢ '
This is the kind of an 'â  organlzafion
that was perfected, and art -agiee-men,t
was further made that Assemblyman
Radcliff should act as the head of a
steering committee of five which was
elected and agreed upon at tne meet
ing. The members of the committee
are Radcliff of Santa Cruz, chairman;
Crowder of San Diego, secretary; Mc-
Donald of Alameda, Greenwell of Ven
tura and Chynoweth of Orange.
The claim has been made that some
members- of the Assembly have been
told that if they desired to, get. any
legislation of their own through at this
session the wise thing to do would be
for them not to rote for Grant. But
the Grant men have stood firm, de
spite any and all of these threats.
What they have done now places them
in a position where they will be able
to retaliate if any of the Burns leaders
attempt to enforce their threats to
defeat the legislation in which any of
the Grant supporters are interested.
Grant has twenty-one votes in the As
sembly and Burns has only nineteen,
so it will be seen that the Grant men
are able to defeat just as many bills
with their Assembly votes as -Colonel
Burns is with his.
"V What brought the Grant people ut> to
this action was the manner in which
they lost the contest over the Speaker
ship. Assemblyman Belshaw was elect
ed in caucus when the end of the roll
call was reached, and the result turned
over to Chairman Dibble to announce.
' But he failed to announce the result
for several minutes, so the Grant men
claim, until a change of one vote was
effected, which made the result a tie
vote and a second ballot defeated Bel
shaw.
The Grant men felt very sore. They
admitted in their caucus to-night that
Judge Dibble, for the Burns contingent,
had outgeneraled them, but they do
not propose to have it done again.
They propose to work under the direc
tion of a steering committee and vote
together at aIL times.
In the Senate there are only seven
Grant men, and the> are generally to
gether on matters that involve the Sen
atorial contest in any way. Senators
Smith and Cutter generally outline the
course for them to pursue.
CHURCH TAX AMENDMENT
PASSES THE ASSEMBLY
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 31.â Constitutional amend
ment No. 6, Introduced by McDonald of
Alameda County, passed the Assembly
to-day after it had precipitated a good
bit of windjammlng, and if it Bhall go
through the Senate with as much noise
and little trouble and the people agree
the churches of California of whatever
sect will be no longer required to pay
taxes upon their immediate property.
McDonald's amendment has pursued a
windy course despite the fact that the
Assembly was generally favorably inclin
ed toward it. Mr. Johnson led in the
spellbinding this morning when the
measure came up on the special order,
and he was followed by McDonald. Mr.
Dibble also spoke, and only Feliz of Mon
terey talked against it. He said that to
exempt the churches from taxation would
be to again wed church and state. Mr.
Feliz spoke at some length and eloquently.
Assemblyman O'Brien of San Francisco
settled the question consistently by ar
guing that the only course for the As
sembly to take was to pass the amend
ment as the people of the State would
have to vote on it before it could
become a law. When it came to a roll
call there were only a fpw scattering
minority votes against it. The debate on
the proposition occupied the greater part
of the morning, and when the Joint ballot
was over the patronage caucus was an
nounced and adjournment taken to the
usual hour to-morrow.

A WAR OF WORDS
OVER WAR MONEY
CALL HKADQUARTERS. SACRA
MKN'To. Jan. 31.â Quite an exciting and
nmusing war of words took place this
afternoon at the meeting of the Assem
bly Ways and Means Committee. The
principals in the contest were ex-Surveyor
General Janus W. Shanklln and Thomas
M. Nosier. The circumstances leading up
to the argument related to the existence
<jf two bills which were introduced re
epectlvelj by the participants.
It seems that Nosier was one of the
agents employed by the State to collect
certain moneys which were due the State
for funds advanced by California during
th.^ war of the rebellion to the United
States, ami which has not as yet been re
paid in full. The bill which Nosier has
before the committee Is for his relief, as
lio <l:ums th;it there is some accrued com
mission which he has not yet received.
Shanklin also has a claim against the
State for services rendered to Nosier,
claiming that he was employed by him In
his work of collecting the money. Shank
lin also hris a substitute bill which he
rlaLms will fft both cases and this was
the bone of contention. After listening to
the arguments of both parties the com
mittee, very much to the disappointment
of both the gentlemen interested, decided
to lay the matter over until some future
meeting. Bill 159, an act making an ap
propriation to pay the claim of the State
Board of Horticulture for moneys ex
panded in behalf of the State, was re
ported favorably upon by the committee.
STRATTON'S ELECTION BILL

MKNTO, Jan. 31.â The Stratton primary

passed to third reading by the Senate.
A determined effort to defeat the bill
waa made by Senators Cotter and Short

Si nator Cutter endeavored to bring

BRAUNHART'S PET BILLS
ALL TURNED DOWN
CALL HEADQUARTERS, . SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 31.â Senator Braunhart of
San Francisco is this evening consoling
himself with the thought that he Is a
much abused man, for without exception
the. Senate Judiciary Committee turned
him down upon every one of the pet bills
that he has been to so much trouble form
ulating and which, If they had become
laws, Mr, Braunhart would have made a
record for himself that would have made
him an object of envy to many of his
fellow-Senators.
The bills upon which 'the committee de
clined to pass favorably were those re
lating to the cutting down of fees now j
received by Public Administrators and i
also giving the heirs to estates of the de- |
ceased the power to choose any attorney
they wished to. act as administrator, i
whereas at present It is the duty of the j
court to so do.
Mr. Braunhart spoke at some length |
upon the bills as they came up, and gave
as the reason for formulating them the
fabulous fees now received by Adminis
trators, which in many cases eat up the
l entire estate.
He also contends that the heirs of the.
deceased should have the right to choose
their own attorney, as In many cases, un
der the present regime, the court appoints
unscrupulous attorneys, who make it a
point to divert to their own use as much
of the estate as possible. AC a*f Charles
Snook of Alameda County fcppvvred for
the Administrator of that county, Abra
ham Ruef for that of San Francisco and
Elwood Bruner for the Administrator of
Sacramento County. They all spoke In
decided' terms against the measure, and
met with very little opposition except on
the part of Senator Braunhart.

ARRESTED ON
SUSPICION OF
INCENDIARISM
Wm. Sargeant May Be
Charged With Arson.
William Sargefcnt, rooming at 230 Clinton
Park, who was arrested early yesterday
morning by Officer Samuels for disturbing
the peace, may have the more serious
charge of arson placed against him. His
case came up in Judge Mogan's court yes
terday morning, and at the request of the
arresting officer it was put over until
Thursday and Sargeant was held without
bail pending an investigation of the fire
at his lodging place early yesterday morn
ing.
Officer Samuels, who lives across the
street from the house at 230 Clinton Park,
was awakened about half-past 2 o'clock
yesterday morning by the cry of fire.
Hastily dressing he rushed into the street
and saw a blaze in the house owned by
a man named Hadsell and occupied by a
family named Thompson. The blaze was
in the basement, and the policeman, see
ing that the flames had not gained much
headway, sought to extinguish them with
out turning in an alarm. As he ran
toward the house Sargeant stopped him
and sought to keep him from entering
the basement. After a short struggle
Samuels threw Sargeant from him, and,
finding no buckets about the ijlace, se
cured some from his own home and put
out the fire. After the blaze was ex
tinguished Samuels arrested Sargeant for
disturbing the peace.
The neighbors who were' present at the
fire were of the opinion that it was a case
of Incendiarism. Mrs. Thompson was the
first one to discover the fire, and it is said
that Sargeant, who had not been to bed
up to that time, sought to keep her and !
others from giving the alarm. No one
seems to know what obiect Sargeant
would have in setting the place on lire.
The blaze started In the basement
among a pile of old rubbish, which had |
been scraped into a corner next to a |
wooden partition, and had not Officer
Samuels Deen so prompt in getting water
on th<? flames it is probable that the house
would have been burned to the ground.
The police have notified Fire Marshal
Towe and an investigation will be made
to-day.

As Lavigne has been in the city ever
since he fought Tracy, he will commence
training at once.
"I am glad that Smith has agreed to
come out here and meet me," said "Kid"
Lavigne when seen last night. "I con
sider him to be the best man In the wel
ter-weight division. His style Is some
what similar to my own. When he en
ters the ring with a man he seems to
have an object in view other than see-
Ing how many times he can run around
the ring without being hit. â  I have seen
him in several of his battles, and I believe
I can beat him. Since my fight with
Tracy I have taken excellent care of my
self and I will have little trouble in con
ditioning myself for Smith. However I
intend to" start training immediately, for
I realize that Smith is hard game. I
will train at Blanken's Six Mile House."
Jim Kennedy received a telegram from
Smith late last ni#ht stating that he
would leave New York for this city to

modifications the Republican opposi

TACOMA, Jan. 31.â Boisfort, a small
town In Lewis County, has supplied
more sensations than any other com
munity of this State during the past
sixty days. Within that time two citi
zens â father and stepson â have been
accidentally killed by the same rifle
while hunting. Another hunter has
been lost In the mountains and is now
mourned as dead. Yesterday a trag
edy-came to light, when the charred
remains of V. A. Faddaugh were dis
covered among the ruins of his cedar
log cabin, eight miles west of Chehalis.
It was first believed Faddaugh had
been burned to death while asleep in
his cabin, but later discoveries indicate
that he was the victim of foul play.
This belief is strengthened by the
fact that Faddaugh drew a sum ot
money out of the bank at Chehalis sev
eral days ago. His friends have come
to the concluaion that he was murdered
for his money by some one who Knew
he had it in his poss^sion, and that
his cabin. was afterward fired to Rhow
that he had been burned to death while
asleep.
Neighbors noticed a fire at Fad
daugh's place on Sunday night, but as
brush tires are common where land is
being cleared, they thought nothing of.
It. Yesterday morning, however, John
White went over to see Faddaugh and
found that his cabin had been burned.
In the ashes the body was found, burn
ed almost beyond recognition.
As soon as this news reached Cheha-
Hs an Investigation was commenced un
der the auspices of Coroner Mead and
Prosecuting Attorney Harmon, who
was a cousin of Faddaugh. Accompa
nied by Deputy Sheriff Fourot, they
proceeded to Faddaugh's ranch and
impaneled a Coroner's jury. They dis
covered that the dead man's head and
limbs had been severed from his Dody.
What are thought to be bullet marks
were found on his watch case, and evi
dence of violence is said to have been
found on the breast of the corpse.
A young man named William Tay
lor testified at the Inquest that I> ad
daugh had brought to the ranch the
money he got from the bank. Taylor's
actions were deemed somewhat suspi
cious and to-day he was brought to
Chehalis in custody on suspicion of be
ing implicated. Coroner Mead refuses
to give out further details of the evi
dence at the inquest, but since Taylor
has been held there Is little doubt that
more evidence that Faddaugh was mur
dered was obtained.
Faddaugh was over 50 years old and
came to Chehalis last fall from Polo,
Mo. The farm on which he was killed
was homesteaded by his son, who was
killed in September near Walla Walla
by the turning over of a traction engine
belonging to a threshing outfit. Soon
after this the father came out to settle
his son's estate and look after his prop
erty. He had spent most of his time
in Chehalis until last week, when he
went out to Boisfort to sttrt spring
work on the ranch. Before going he
drew the money in question out of the
bank, Intending to use It to buy an ad
joining forty acres of land which he
was very desirous of obtaining.
Faddaugh was a nephew of Rev. A.
A. Harmon of Chehalis and a cousin
of Prosecutor Harmon, both of whom
are determined that his murderers shall
be hunted down. Young Taylor, who ts
held on susolclon. was an acquaintance
of the dead man in Missouri.

VANCOUVER, Wash., Jan. 31.â The
first battalion of the Eighth California
Volunteer Infantry, consisting of Compa
nies D, G, I and H, which has been sta
tioned at Vancouver Barracks for the
past three months, was formally mustered
out of service to-day. The majority of
the battalion left to-night for California
in a special train over the Southern Pa
cific.
MesÃrs. Dalzell of Pennsylvania and
Hopkins of Illinois, in closing for the
majority, and Messrs. Bailey of Texas
and Settle of Kentucky for the oppo
sition. This programme was smashed
owing to the failure to complete the
debate under the five minute rule be
fore 3 o'clock, the hour set for the vote.
Among the important amendments
adopted before the vote was taken to
day was one to exclude the appointment
of civilians to positions in the Engineer
Corps, one to abolish canteens and the
sale of liquor in camps and one to
strike out the provision for additional
pay for commands serving in the West
Indies and Philippines and Alaska. The
amendment of Mr. Cummings of New
York to prohibit the use of troops in
the several States to suppress riots,
etc., except upon the applications of
the States was defeated by a large ma
jority. The motion to recommit with
instructions to report back the minority
substitute only commanded two Repub
lican votes, and was lost, 117 to 170.
The bill as passed provides, in ad
dition to the general officers and staff
departments, for twelve regiments of
cavalry of twelve troops each, 144 coast
batteries, twenty-four field batteries,
thirty regiments of infantry of twelve
companies each, a corps of engineers
and one regiment of engineers, an ord
nance department and a signal corps,
the latter with 625 men. It also gives
the President discretion to recruit the
organization serving in Cuba, Porto
Rico and the islands of the Pacific in
whole or in part from the inhabitants
thereof.
Before the House adjourned to-day
the river and harbor bill was formally
called up in order to make it the un
finished business in the committee of
the whole.

Tacoma Lumberman to

VICTORIOUS IN A CAUCUS
NAMED BY REPUBLICANS AT
OLYMPIA.
At the Close of a Bitter Fight the In
cumbent Throws His Support
Against His Own
County.
Special Dispatch to The Call. *
SEATTLE, Jan. 31.â Addlson G. Fos
ter of Tacoma, one of the best-known
lumber men in the Northwest, was to
night elected United States Senator to
succeed John L. Wilson, after one of
the most bitter political fights in the
history of the State. There were two
other candidates in the field â Senator
Wilson and Levi Ankeny. J. T. Humes,
Mayor of Seattle, was in the fight at
the start, but last night withdrew and
threw his strength to Ankeny, a banker
and one of the wealthiest men of the
coast.
The one great desire of the three can
didates â Humes, Foster and Ankeny â
seemed to be to defeat Wilson, who, it
was alleged, disregarded the welfare
of the Republican party of the State
for the purpose of building up a per
sonal organization. Wilson to-day was
compelled to realize that his chances
of being returned to the Senate were
very poor. He was very bitter at King
County, first for putting up Mayor
Humes as a candidate against him,
and second in later throwing Humes'
strength to Ankeny. Realizing that his
political future was a wreck, and for
the purpose of "getting even" with
King County, he to-night, during a
caucus of the Republicans, threw l his
strength to Foster, making him the
caucus nominee.
There was much excitement over the
result. King County claiming that sev
eral of her delegates betrayed her in
terests by first voting for Wilson and
later going with the Foster forces.
Wllso'n had the support of Mark Hanna
In his fight.
HUNTSMAN MISSING
NEAR HEALDSBURG
HEALDSBURG, Jan. 31.â About a
month ago two men with horses and
wagon laden with provisions passed up
Mill Creek and stopped at a cabin locat
ed at the head of Pena Creek. A few days
later one of the men returned with the
rig, the other presumably remaining- for a
hunting and fishing vacation.
Last Sunday Messrs. Hayes, Corbell and
others happened to pass that way and
stopped for a chat with the stranger. No
response was received to their knocks at
the door and they entered without invi
tation. The cabin was found unoccupied,
but well stocked with provisions of all
kinds. The men searched in the neigh
borhood of the cabin, but found no trace
of the missing man.
The residents of that section believe
that the man met with foul play at the
hands of his companion or accidentally
shot himself while hunting in the wilds
of that region.

PANIC FOLLOWS
A MINING BOOM
Excitement on Denver's
Exchange.
ISABELLA STOCK DECLINES
FALLING AS RAPIDLY AS IT HAD
GONE UP.
Reached fl 80 a Share After the Re
cent Remarkable Gold Strike,
but Has Now Receded
to $1 30.
Special Dispatch to The Call. *
DENVER, Jan. 31.â The recent dis
covery of wonderfully rich ore 'in the
property of the Isabella Gold Mining
Company at Cripple Creek has caused
the greatest excitement on the mining
stock exchanges of this city, Colorado
Springs and Cripple Creek that has
been witnessed in a number of years.
The stock of this company, which six
weeks ago was quoted at 22 cents a
share, sold on the exchanges yesterday
at Jl 80, having jumped from 90 cents
in two days.
This morning signs of a reaction were
apparent when the exchange opened.
The first sale of Isabella was at $1 60
and at once the panic began. There
were many buyers, but offerings were
too heavy for them and the price grad
uallyl sank to Jl 49 and 51 50 at the
close of the first call. When the sec
ond call opened there was a further
decline and the panic continued, the
last sales bringing $1 29^@1 30. The
sales to-day were 127,000 shares.
To-night there is a great diversity of
opinion as to the action of the stock
to-morrow, many declaring that the
bear movement has done Its worst and
predicting that the next upward turn
will carry the stock to 52. This is based
on the claim that the mine has $5,000,000
worth of ore running $1000 In gold to
the ton now in sight. The company Is
capitalized at $2,250,000.
The excitement on 'Change, which
has been entirely due to the Isabella
strike, has been largely confined to
that stock, though several other gold
stocks have been Influenced sympa
thetically. The fluctuations were for
the most part within narrow limits.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 31.â Chief of
Police Glass was to-day Instructed by
the Board, of Police Commissioners to
enforce the city ordinances that are
designated to regulate the business
hours of saloons. Should the Chief car
ry out to the letter the order given he
will be compelled to see to it that no
saloon remains open for business after
midnight of any day, and not for a
minute on Sunday. He will also look
into the conduct of those places hav
ing a restaurant license, and will keep
a lookout on drug stores that cell whis
ky by the drink.
At a meeting of the board this morn
ing Mayor Eaton brought ud vhe sub
ject, which is fraught with much im
portance to liquor dealers. May Dr Eat
on said he had learned .that riome sa
loons were disregarding the ordinance
requiring the closing of saloons at mid
night and all day on Sunday. In view
of information that had come to him
he suggested that the board* instruct
the chief to enforce the law.
Commissioner Scarborough explained
that he knew personally that most, if
not all, drug stores sold whisky to any
person for ten cents a drink, and did
not demand a physician's prescription.
Commissioner Goss said if druggists
were in the habit of selling liquor at
ten cents a drink it was wrong and
should be looked into, not because it
was a violation of their rights, but be
cause it was hurtful competition of sa
loons that paid $50 a month license.
Chief Glass said the police depart
ment had been "up against" the res
taurant license proposition several
times before. He had found that some
places keep sandwiches until they are
worn smooth in their long continued
use as excuses for the sale of accom
panying drinks.
The commissioners ended the matter
by the adoption of a resolution instruct
ing the Chief to at once proceed against
any persons caught violating the liquor
ordinance, whether they are saloon
men, restaurant men or druggists.

NEW YORK. Jan. 31. â The Washington correspondent of the Herald telegraphs: O
O Resolutions declaring in favor of the ultimate independence of the Philippines will be voted Â®
0 upon before the treaty of peace is ratified. To this extent the anti-expansionists have won a Â©
victory. Whether they will be able to adopt that kind of resolution they want remains to be O

0 amend it. â  O
o On the other hand, the advocates of the treaty are not absolutely certain that they can Â°
O get the sixty votes necessary to ratify if they defy the anti-expansionists by preventing a vote o
0 on the pending independence resolutions. They have fifty-eight votes pledged for the treaty o
o unconditionally. By permitting a vote on the pending resolutions they are sure of more than O
O the necessary vote for the treaty, whatever may be done with the resolutions. Â®
q Accordingly, the Republican leaders, after conference to-day, concluded to allow all the o
O pending resolutions to be voted upon. The programme will be to move reference to the For- O
0 eign Relations Committee of all resolutions as fast as they are brought up, until the one con- Â°

NATIVE ABUSE

Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
HONGKONG, Jan. 31.â The Fili
pino junta here publishes its
protest against the "refusal of
the United States to associate
with the Philippine Commission
representatives of the national govern
ment," adding that "the usefulness of
the commission will necessarily be
greatly limited by the exclusion of Fili
pinos."
The protest continues:
"It is impossible for the commission,
Pitting only at Manila, unaided by the
friendly co-operation of the national
government, to reach a proper Tinder -
Ftanding of the actual condition of af
fairs in the Philippines, the unanimity
Â«>f the aspirations of the 'people and
their capability for self-government.
"Colonel Denby's utterances in the
November Forum are too pronounced
to jnspire confidence."
PARIS, Jan. 31.â The Filipino Junta
here has received a cable" message from
Hongkong explaining the second proc
lamation of the Filipino republic. The
message says:
"The first proclamation in August
was the work of Aguinaldo and the
generals. The second is the unanimous
work of the Filipino assembly."
"Last week a Filipino boy was shot
by an American soldier in a suburb of
Manila because he was wrangling with
a Chinaman in the market. The soldier
was not prosecuted and the boy's
father, in revenge, attacked an Ameri
can outpost armed with a knife and
killed three of them. ' The rest fled.
The Filipino escaped.
"A Filipino officer was killed while
walking in Manila by an American sol
dier. There was no prosecution.
"The American army is daily provok
ing hostilities by acts of vandalism."
The Junta also assert that the allega
tions respecting the filibustering expe
dition and anarchy are falsehoods.
"The whole country," it is asserted,
"has declared its unconditional support
of Aguinaldo. whose authority has
never been defied. The public evidently
ignores the fact that every province in
the archipelago is represented in the
congress."
General Otis' action in prohibiting
code telegrams is a flagrant breach of
international law, but the truth is leak
ing out. The Filipino newspapers de
nounce alleged gross abuses at the Ma
nila custom house.
SENATORS TALKING
ABOUT THE TREATY
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.â During al
most the entire morning hour to-day
the Senate had under discussion the
policy of this country to be pursued
in the Philippine islands. Mr. Berry
of Arkansas in a speech upon the res
olution offered by Mr. West discussed
the policy of expansion without a ref
erence to the constitutional point in
volved in the Vest resolution. He
spoke from notes, stating his objec
tions to the pending treaty of peace.
He declared that he would never vote
to place upon any people a policy
against which Lee fought and against
which Jackson gave up his life.
An attempt by Mr. Bacon of Geor
gia to secure a vote upon his resolu
tion, which, in brief, declared that tbe
United States Government will not
make war upon a people seeking for
their freedom, precipitated a lively de
bate, which was participated in by
Mr. Platt of Connecticut and Mr. Tel
ler of Colorado. Mr. Bacon declared he
would never vote for the treaty unless
some such declaration were adopted
by Congress. To this Mr. Platt took
exception and delivered a speech in
which he carefully analyzed the situ
ation which confronts this country in
the Philippines. No action on the res
olutions was taken.
When the Senate went into executive
session Senators Gray and Money oc
cupied the entire time in speeches on
the peace treaty, Senator Gray favor
ing ratification and Senator Money op
posing it.
Senator Gray was the third of the
Paris Commissioners to speak, and
while he gave some attention to the
published matter bearing upon the
treaty he did not go into this in such
detail as did Senators Frye and Davis.
He admitted that In the beginning of
the negotiations he had been opposed

to the acquisition of the Philippine
archipelago, and said that he had
frankly advised the President and his
fellow-commissioners of his belief that
it would be unwise to attempt to shape
its destiny. He had used his best en
deavors to bring them to accept his
views, but had utterly failed. He had
at last reached the conclusion that he
would either have to join with the ma
jority or see the treaty fail and the war
continue. In the meantime he had been
largely won over by the arguments of
his colleagues and by the logic ol the
situation and he had at last concluded
to sign the convention.
Having taken his position he was
here now to defend the treaty as a wise
conclusion of a most delicate diplomatic
undertaking. Many complications had
beset the commissioners in tljeir work,
and while he would not retract what
he had heretofore said as to the un
desirability of acquiring distant terri
tory as a matter of principle still there
were times when a nation, as an indi
vidual, might have to choose between
evils. There was danger of many com
plications of an international character
in case the United States should have
elected to pursue a different policy. He
reiterated that the ultimate conclusion
to take the entire Philippine group was
that of the commissioners rather than
of the President and also went into the
difficulties of getting the Spanish Com
missioners to come to a conclusion.
Senator Gray did not advocate per
manent occupancy of the Eastern is
lands, but said that the duration of our
exercise of sovereignty there should
be settled in the future and not at
present.
In reply to a question by Senator
Maron he said that he would not at
tempt to fix a timeâ that this only could
be done after we had had an oppor
tunity to study the situation, to know
the people and learn their capacities.
He had every confidence in the Ameri
can people and he believed that they
would not only give the natives their
freedom when they had shown a ca
pacity for taking care of themselves
as a nation of the world, but that they
would manage the affairs of the islands
wisely and well while they controlled
them. They would give the islanders
a fair start in civilization before turn
ing them loose to shift for themselves.
Senator Money attacked the acquisi
tion of the islands as contrary to the
spirit of American Institutions and as
unconstitutional. He said the Govern
ment of the United States could not af
ford to put itself in the attitude of a
Don Quixote in a vain effort to care
for and advance the interests of every
people in every land that appeared, ac
cording to our standards of civilization,
to need our help. He had been an ad
vocate of intervention in the case of
Cuba, but from this fact it did not fol
low that he was willing to transfer the
Philippines from Spanish vassalage to
a dependency of the United States. He

did not consider that we were especially
concerned as to the future of the Fili
pinos, and so far as he was concerned
he would leave them to work out their
own salvation. This would be far pre
ferable to assuming responsibility for
them and making them citizens of the
United States, as they would inevitably
come to be if the treaty should be rati
fied. We had made allies of them in
the Spanish war by the acts of our own
agents and, in the interest of fair deal
ing should let them achieve their in
dependence if they could do so.
Senator Mason, in a few words, in
dorsed Senator Moneys position that
fhe Filipinos would be made citizens by
the ratification of the treaty and Sena
tor Teller, in a brief rejoinder, contro
verted this position, saying that an act
of Congress would be necessary to fix
their status toward the body politic.
Senator Hoar also indorsed Senator
Moneys position.
THE PRESIDENT'S
HEALTH AFFECTED
Illness Compels Him to l>ecline Into-
tations to Future Cere
monies.
NEW YORK, Jan. 31.â A dispatch to
the Press from "Washington says: The
President is so much interested In the
outcome of the struggle over the peace
treaty that he is constantly inquiring
about its progress. He has been so
worn by the shock of persistent oppo
sition in the Senate that his health is
affected.
For more than a week Mr.
McKlnley has been far/rom well.
To Intimate visitors amongpublic
men he has confided the condi
tion of his health as the reason
for not accepting their invita
tions for future ceremonies. At
the same time the assurance has
been given that his illness is only
temporary and certainly will
yield to medical treatment.
Believing that the rumor of his ill
ness might cause unnecessary concern
the President has desired to keep his
condition from the public, and until to
day this wish was respected. But a
New York member of Congress who
had been to the White House brought
the report to the Capitol and spread it
that the. President was far from well.
Friends of the President assert he is
improving and that he soon will be all
right.
AGONCILLO WOULD
CENSOR THE PRESS
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.â 1n his let
ter to the Secretary of State yester
day, inclosing a memorial against the
ratification of the peace treaty, Senor
Agoncillo, the Philippine envoy here,
expressed regret that he had not re
ceived any assurance of the peaceful
intention of America toward the Phil
ippine Republic, and that his people
are left to fear the forcible destruction
by America of her late ally, the .more
so as additional troops had recently
been sent to the Philippines, while vio
lent expressions in the newspapers and
false accusations mentioned in them
against Senor Agoncillo, may serve, he
fears, to increase their fears. He re
grets to observe that these expres
sions and accusations have received no
official condemnation.
MONTEREY COUNTY
HERMIT'S DEMISE
Passing of a Peculiar Character
Whose Only Companions "Were
Dumb Animals.
SALINAS, Jan. 31.-Frederick A. Eken.
a veteran of the civil war, and for more
than twenty-five years a well-known ec
centric character of Monterey County,

ranch near Salinas.

tive of Germany, enlisted on September

teers, and was discharged on October 12.

$17 a month, he lived the life of a hermit
in a ramshackle hut filled with all sorts
of rubbish, surrounded by no less than
thirty cats and six dogs, which shared
his couch and food. He owned a horse
and cart, but to save the animal's
feet, would walk to Salinas and back, a
distance of twelve miles, carrying a
heavy load. He would not speak to any
one unless angered and waa an inveterate
toper.
Death was superinduced by an attack of
pneumonia. He will be buried under the
auspices of the local Grand Army poÃt,
of which he was a member.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. 31.â A spe
cial to the Gazette from Texarkana,
Ark., says: There passed through Tex
arkana to-day eight trainloads of negro
soldiers, 1200 in number, composing the
Tenth United States Cavalry, en route
to San Antonio.. When they arrived
here they were a drunken mob and an
effort was made by them to "tear up"
the town.
A number of the colored soldiers
kicked in a door and entered a resort
and started to run the place at the
point of loaded rifles. Constable James
Rochelle was called to the place after
they had broken up the furniture. A
chase for the cars resulted and just as
they reached them Rochelle captured
the leader of the gang. As soon as he
did so a hundred rifles were leveled at
him and every negro loaded his gun.
Every car window held a drunken
negro with a cocked rifle and after the
guns had been thrust against the of
ficer's face the negro escaped into the
The news spread and every officer in
Texarkana and hundreds of citizens
flocked around the negro soldiers, who
seemed anxious for trouble. County
Attorney Horace Vaugnan placed him
self in communication with the Gov
ernor and as a result the trains were
held here for seven hours. The negroes
wanted were kept in a car with an
armed guard outside. The trains were
surrounded by irate citizens, who were
supplied with dynamite, ready to send
the entire horde to destruction. The
negroes learned of this and finally
agreed to hand over the guilty ones
upon identification, but as this was im
possible no arresis were made. Cool
heads prevented more serious trouble.

THE PRINCESS OF
BULGARIA DEAD
She Was the Enemy of
Stambuloff.
AN OLD STORY RECALLED
A STATESMAN'S WIDOW KEEPS
HER VENGEANCE ALIVE.
Her Husband's Dead Hands Beached
Out to Drag Marie of Parma
Away From Happi
ness.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SOFIA, Jan. 31.â Princess Ferdinand
of Bulgaria died to-day of pneumonia.
She gave birth to a daughter last even
ing.
The Princess was dying last evening-,
but the fact was hidden from the popu
lation. She was still conscious this
evening and bade farewell to the chil
dren. Prince Ferdinand remained at the
bedside throughout.
Princess Ferdinand of Bulgaria was
Marie Louise, eldest daughter of Duke
Robert of Parma. She was born on
January 17, 1870, and was married on
April 20, 1893, to Prince Ferdinand, the
reigning prince of Bulgaria. Prince
and Princess Ferdinand of Bulgaria
have four children, Boris, born January
30, 1894; Cyril, born November 17, 1895;
a daughter, born in January, 1898, and
the daughter born last evening.
The enmity that existed between the
Princess and the late M. Stefan Stam
buloff, the Bulgarian statesman, is now
recalled. M. Stambuloff's friends al
ways attributed the murderous attack
made upon him in July, 1895, to the
Princess, and his widow, who still keeps
her husband's hands in spirits to show
her children and to prevent them for
getting how their father died, once
said: "These hands are outstretched
to grasp Marie Louise of Parma to drag
her away from happiness."
The late M. Stambuloff was returning
home from the Union Club on the even
ing of July 15, 1895, accompanied by a
friend, M. Petkoff, when the two men
were attacked by four persons, armed
with revolvers and knives. The assail
ants compelled M. Stambuloff's coach
man to stop the horses. Stambuloff
jumped out and received immediately
a cut which almost severed his hand
from the wrist. He tried to escape.
WEALTHY QUAKER
COMMITS SUICIDE
No Reason Can Be Given by His
friends Why He Should Y\ave
Shot hjimself.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 31.â George Towne, a Quaker and one of the
pioneer settlers of the Quaker town of "Whittier. committed suicide in
his barn with a 22-caliber revolver at an unknown hour yesterday.
Towne, who was 45 years old, disappeared from his home after break
fast, was found at 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon and died at 11 last night
without regaining consciousness. Towne had lived in Whittier from the
founding of the colony and was highly respected. No one seems to be
able to give a reason why Towne should have committed self-murder.
He was supposed to be wealthy, owned two ranches and some prop
erty in town and &s far as can be ascertained ha*d no domestic troubles.
No recent illness had caused him to take a morbid view of life. The
only explanation given by his friends is that he had grown despondent
over the failure of his ranches on account of a possible drouth.
but was followed and stabbed in the
heart, receiving also a revolver shot.
When he fell his assailant continued to
stab him, almost cutting off the other
hand. M. Petkoff, who did all in his
power to assist the fallen man. was
also severely stabbed. M. Stambuloff's
left eye was gouged out, the other was
also destroyed, and he received In all
fifteen terrible wounds. M. Petkoff
afterward declared that he saw five
gendarmes near by when the attack
was made, and saw them run away,
without giving the least assistance.
MODOC'S DEFAULTING
TREASURER CAUGHT
New Orleans Detectives Arrest a Man
Believed to Be "Honest John"
Madden.
REDDING, Jan. 31.â A report from Al
turas announces that John Madden, the
defaulting Treasurer of Modoc County,
has been placed under arrest in New Or
leans. Photographs of the suspect are
now on the way from the Crescent City
to Alturas for identification.
About two months ago the authorities
of Modoc were notified that a man an
swering Maddens description was being
shadowed by detectives in Louisiana and
the Board of Supervisors of Modoc appro
priated $200 and sent the money to New
Orleans to assist in running the defaulter
to earth. Word has now been received
that the man is under arrest and await
ing extradition as soon as his identifica
tion shall have been established.
Madden fled from Modoc County about
$30,000 short in his accounts. By the aid
of powerful friends he got beyond pur
suit before the discovery of his crime was
made public or before decisive action was
taken looking- to his apprehension. It was
supposed that Madden had fled to the
Orient, as he was seen once in Honolulu,
but this was doubtless a mistake, as the
man now locked up in New Orleans is
thought to be the defaulter beyond a
doubt.
SMALLPOX INCREASING
IN THE ANGEL CITY
Three New Cases Reported to the
Health Office in a Single
Day.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 31.â1n spite of the
precautions taken by the Health Depart
ment to prevent the spread of smallpox,
the disease is increasing in this city.
Three new cases developed to-day, mak
ing fifteen cases since the disease was
first discovered here several weeks ago.
Health Officer Powers said to-day ha
considered it necessary that everyperson
take all precautions possible and not ex
pose himself to contagion of any disease.
He recommends immediate vaccination
as a precautionary measure. He says the
situation is not necessarily alarming at
present, but it is such as to require every
possible precaution to prevent a spread of
the disease.

CONTRACT LABOR
FOR THE ISLANDS
Portuguese Immigration
to Hawaii.
HONOLULU, Jan. 24.â 8y arrange
ment between Special Chinese Agent
Brown and the attorneys for the Chi
nese who have been denied a landing
here, all these Chinese will be held
here pending the determination of the
appeal to the Treasury Department. As
to the others who may arrive and be
refused a landing it has not been de
cided what shall be done. The expec
tation is, however, that if they also ap
peal to the Secretary of the Treasury
they will be permitted to remain at the
quarantine station until their appeal is
heard and decided. It is not expected,
however, that many more will come.
The Rio brought only sixteen. Evi
dently word has reached the Chinese in
China holding permits that the permits
are not recognized.
Of permits issued to Chinese to enable
them to go from here to China and re
turn there are still about 600 outstand
ing. Of these there are many that
probably will never be presented. Some
have been practically outlawed by lapse
of time. Some have been lost or de
stroyed. Others were issued but never
used, those to whom they were issued
never leaving the islands. It is be
lieved that the bulk of the permits
which will ever come to light to raise
an issue have been presented.
Of permits to enable Hawaiian-born i
Chinese residing in China to return to
the islands there is no controversy as
to their validity. They are accepted as
evidence of the right to land upon proof
that the person presenting them is
really Hawaiian born.
More PortuÃu-se will be brought at
once to the Hawaiian Islands to work In
the cane fields. They will come from
Madeira, the Azores and the mainland.
One and perhaps two steamship loads
will be sent from the other side as soon
as they can be engaged and collected.
The first steamer should leave the
Azores in about two months at the la
test. Mr. Hoffnung, at London, is act
ing for the planters in engaging the
labor. He is in a better position than
any one else known here to negotiate
direct for the men. By a mail about
three weeks go he wrote that an in
definite number of. Portuguese could be
engaged. It was a reply to a question
along the line a few days ago that the
Government gavo the planters. The lat
ter wanted to know if thore were an
objection to the importation of more
Portuguese, and the authorities replied
that there was none. A cable was at
once sent to Mr. Hoffnung to engage
the number required immediately.
These immigrants will sign contracts.
Just what their status will be after the
United States laws are in full force here
it is impossible to tell. It is almost cer
tain that the contracts will not have
more than civil force, if that. Assist
ing the immigrants with passage money
will also be a thing of the past.
Joseph Marsden has written to the
planters' association representing Ital
ian laborers. He feels sure that all the
plantation help required may be en
listed among the peasant class of Italy.
There is something in the contracts
that have to be made with the Italians, '
however, that will make it impossible
to import them in numbers, it is re
quired by the Government at Rome
that, under certain circumstances, the
laborers are to be returned to Italy at
the expense of the Hawaiian planters.
A letter requesting further informa
tion concerning the Russian colony pre
posed for Hawaii has been sent for
â¢ward.
John T. Campbell has petitioned the
court for a writ of mandamus to issue
against F. B. McStocker, Collector
General of Customs, to compel the res

â¢f beef, that was different from em- +
â f balmed beef. The canned roast +
â¦ beef was the beef after the ex- +

â¦ If swallowed it could not be kept â¦
â¢â¦â  on the stomach." +
It was pointed out to General Miles
j that he had been quoted as having said
, that if the men who supplied the beef
would deposit a thousand dollars in
such a way that it could be made to pay
' the cost of the proceedings he would
furnish absolute proof of his asser
tions.
He was asked what tribunal he had
! in mind, or to whom he would furnish
this proof, and in reply said: "I made
that statement in response to the offer
of the beef men to pay $100,000 for evi
dence of the truth of my allegations
: against their product. I took their
i offer as a bluff and took that way of
: answering it. I have no tribunal in
; mind. I have the greatest abundance
of evidence to support the charges I

I of the thousand dollars need be spent

General Miles has received a tele
; gram from Co-lonel A. A. Pope of Boston
i requesting General Miles to draw on
: him for $1000 to prove that chemicals

to soldiers, but this offer will not be
accepted for the reasons already given.
DANGER OF TROUBLE
IN SAMOA AVERTED
NEW YORK, Jan. 31. â A Washington special to the Herald says:
In reply to the representations of Embassador White, Germany has
assured the United States that she will investigate the conduct of
her representatives in Samoa, and should it be shown that they have
acted in violation of the treaty of Berlin she will recall them. By
this assurance Germany has removed the Samoan question from the
dangerous position it occupied.
The authorities had anticipated that Germany would decline to
accept responsibility by representations recently made by Embassa
dor Yon Holleben. the German representative here, who informed
Secretary Hay that he felt satisfied the German Consu; and Herr
Raffael had acted without authority from Berlin.
Sacretary Hay is quite willing to give Germany all the necessary
time to investigate, and it is expected that by this time she has
taken action. That there may be no doubt of the facts, and to pro
tect the American representatives, Commodore Kautz, who left San
Diego, California, on board the Philadelphia to-day, will make a thor
ough investigation and report the facts without delay.

MONSTER COMBINE OF
WHISKY DISTILLERIES
Includes All Kentucky Concerns Pro
ducing the Bourbon
Article.
LOUISVILLE. Ky., Jan. 31.â A1l bour
bon whisky distilleries in this State have
been at last brought under the control of
one central organization. The deal was
closed to-day in New York after months
of negotiation. The new combine or trust
Is capitalized at $32,000,000, of which $12,
--000,000 is preferred and $20,000,000 common
stock. The treasury will reserve $1,500,000
each of preferred and common stock and
cash to the amount of $1,000,000 to meet
immediate demands. The combination in
cludes sixty distilleries in various portions
of the State, with all outstanding bonds,
and acquires between 9,000,000 and 10,000,000
gallons of whisky now In bond.
All Cincinnati firms owning distilleries
in Kentucky have signified a willingness to
enter the combination. These include
Freiberg & AVorkum, Senior & Son Elias
Block & Son, James Levy & 8r0.,' Hoff
helmer Bros., the Peacock Distilling Com
pany and Lomaddux. Atllla Cox, presi
dent of the Columbia and Trust Company
of this city, will be at the head of the
concern.
The Melwood and Runnymede distil
leries, two of the largest, were the laÃt
establishments to be taken Into the com
bine. The James E. Pepper distillery at
Lexington, Ky., is not yet In, but the
promoters are confident it will come into
the fold.
The first move of the trust will be to do
away with the present expensive methods
of disposing of the output and to that end
will form a central distributing agency
with headquarters in this city. All trav
eling representative now employed by
individual distillers will be called in, the
i best of them retained in the service of the
i combine and the others lÂ«t go. The out
put will be restricted and prices, now said
to be ruinously low, advanced to a living
basis and kept there.

PORTER GOES
TO VISIT GOMEZ
Said to Carry Letters
From McKinley.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Jan. 31.â Robert P. Por
ter, the representative of President Mc-
Kinley and SenorGor.zales Quesada.the
Cuban commissioner, who recently left
Washington on a special mission to
Cuba, started at 6 o'clock this morning
for Caibarien, province of Santa Clara,
in order to see General Maximo Gomez.
Mr. Porter's mission to General
Gomez is of a twofold character, to
discuss with him fully the position of
the Cuban army and to invite him to
Havana. The Washington administra
tion desires an immediate and friendly
settlement of the Cuban army ques
tion. As the military chiefs decisively
refuse to accept $3,000,000 in complete
satisfaction of the claims of the sol
diers, the Washington Government has
determined, it is understood, to offer a
much larger sum, even as high as $15.
--000,000, if less will not be accepted.
Whatever is agreed upon is to be a
charge upon the revenues of the island
until it is paid.
The Cubans, civilians and military,
are aware that an engagement of this
sort may prolong the American occu
pation, but as it seems to be their
earnest wish that the army be paid a
large sum, the administration at Wash
ington will yield, it is understood, and
open negotiations with this ultimate
object.
Mr. Porter is said to carry letters
from President McKinley ana Gover
nor General Brooke. The scope of hia
instructions is not disclosed, except
that it is known that he has rather full
preliminary powers. Senor Quesada
did not know them until he and Mr.
Porter were aboard ship.
STEAMSHIP ASHORE.
LEWES, Del., Jan. 31.â An unknown
steamer is ashore north of the Fenwlck
Island life-saving station, but the night is
so dark and thick that it is impossible to
learn her identity. It is thought that it la
a tramp steamer. She lies in an easy
position, well up on the beach. The north
bound patrolmen of the station late to
night saw the steamer's lights through
the driving snow. They signaled that
assistance would be sent and notified the
station. Keeper Long harnessed a strong
team of horses to the apparatus, and with
the life-saving crew made for the strand
ed ship as fast as the deep snow would
permit. At a late hour they had not re

SAN JOSE BANK
CLOSES ITS DOORS
Union Savings Institu
tion Suspends.
MADE DISASTROUS LOANS
PRESIDENT SAYS DEPOSITORS
WILL NOT LOijE.
Collapse Caused by the Advancing of
Large Sums to a Fruit Ship
per Who Could Not
Repay.
Eperial Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. Sl.â The Union Savings
Bank of this city suspended business this
morning, and the Bank Commissioners
will arrive here to-morrow to assume
charge of the institution. The failure was
caused by the bank making advances to
E. B. Howard, a fruit shipper, amounting
to about $100,000, and from the fact that
it has been unable to realize upon the se
curities given.
The doors of the bank were opened as
usual this morning, but all checks were
refused and depositors turned away. News
of the failure spread rapidly, but no great
excitement was created. A small crowd
gathered at the place, but all expressed
confidence that the depositors would be
paid in full. There was no run on other
banks. At 3 o'clock it was announced
that the doors would remain closed un
til matters were straightened.
For over a year rumors have been in
circulation that the bank was shaky
and many deposits were withdrawn.
Lately it became publicly known that the
bank was carrying Howard along and"
this made people wary. During the past
few days acceptances in the shape of time
drafts deposited by Howard were re
turned protested. These amounted to
about $30,000. The Union Savings Bank
had to meet these and it took all Its
working capital. This morning, it is
said, there was less than $10,000 on hand.
H. Ward Wright, president and manager,
went to San Francisco to try to raise
some money yesterday afternoon, but was
unsuccessful. It was then decided to
close the bank.
T. R. Weaver, president of the Berry
essa Fruit Growers' Union, on Saturday
attached Howard for $2059 for fr>-' <*old
to him by the union. Before doing so
Weaver went to the T'nion Bank and
drew out $2900 belonging to tne Fruit
Growers' Union. This atachment con
vinced the bank that Howard's failure
was certain and would involve the insti
tution. Efforts to raise money were
futile and the only alternative was to
close.
The stockholders of the bank are all
rich men whose wealth aggregates $7,000,
--000. Among them are C. H. Hopkins, J.
O. Hirschfelder, E. Mandel and the De
Laveagas of San Francisco. The deposits
amount to about $780,000. The securities
are nearly ample to meet these. The San
Jose Building and Loan Association,
which has its office in the bank, has $8000
on deposit, but otherwise will not be af
fected.
This morning an absolute deed of the
bank premises on First and Mountain
streets to Myra E. Wright, wife of Wil
liam H. Wright, one of the stockholders,
was filed in the Recorder's office. The
deed was dated June 15, 1898. Revenue
stamps on it to show the consideration to
have been $60,000.
This afternoon a whole batch of assign
ments from the Union Savings Bank were
filed. These were mortgages that had
been transferred about two years ago.
The assignees and the amounts were:
Union Trust Company of San Francisco,
$4900; I. W. Hellman, president of the Ne
vada Bank, $22,500.
The Union Savings Bank was organized
ten years ago with a capital of $1,000,000,
of which $300,000 was paid up. The re
serve fund is given as $40,000. The officers
are: H. Ward Wright, president and man
ager; Henry Edwards, vice president; An
tone Friant, cashier; directorsâ N. Bow
den, A. Friant, W. H. Wright, H. W.
Wright. Thomas Johnson, E. A. Wheeler,
H. C. Morrill.
President Wright said this evening:
"The Union Savings Bank will reopen
within three months. The depositors will
be paid in full by assessing the stockhold
ers. The bank nas good securities. The
deed to. Myra E. Wright, filed to-day, was
for security for $60,000 borrowed last
summer. Thirty-five thousand dollars of
this loan has already been paid. The
bank's failure is due to carrying Howard
along. He became so deeply indebted to
us that we had to keep advancing him
money, and some of his securities in the
shape of drafts were not good. His in
debtedness of nearly $100,000 is probably
secured for two-thirds."

A Great Mass of Ice Sweeps
Down Upon the Line of the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Jan. 31.â Nine
men employed In the shops and round
house of the Canadian Pacific Railway
at Rogers Pass, two women and two
children were buried to-day under a
mass of snow and ice, which, without
warning, swept down the mountain side
with such force that it carried every
thing before It.
Two of the men were taken out badly
bruised, but alive, late to-night. Their
seven companions are still unrecovered
and are no doubt dead.
These are known to have been in the
round-house:
AGENT CATON, wife and two chil
dren.
OPERATOR CARSON.
ENGINE WIPER REIDLEY.
The names of the others are not
given, but one of them was a woman.
A gang of fifty men, gathered to
gether as soon as possible after the
catastrophe, have been at work at
tempting to save the Imprisoned men,
and will work all night or as long as
they can stand it in the effort to se
cure the bodies of the victims of the
avalanche.

HOSTILE TO THE
SHIPPING BILL
Memorials From Two
San Franciscans.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.â Charles
Nelson, president of the Chamber of
Commerce of San Francisco, and Hugh
Craig, ex-president, sent to Senator
Perkins memorials in favor of amend
ing the Hanna shipping bill by insert
ing an amendment providing for an ex
port bounty on agricultural products.
The Senator is surprised that the
Chamber of Commerce should thus be
placed in the light of advocating en
amendment which would be regarded as
hostile to the bill. The Hanna measure
is designed to encourage exports of all
kindsâ agricultural includedâ by put
ting the influence of the American flag
behind the goods and pushing them In
old markets and opening new ones for
them. It is based on the principle of
payments for the distance sailed and
efficiency of service, which is quite dif
ferent from that of an export bounty
on certain products. The two principles
could not be combined in the same bill
with any hope that it could then pass
and an insistence upon such an amend
ment would be, therefore, regarded as
an act of hostility to the bill itself.
The question of an export bounty on
agricultural products can be brought
properly before Congress only in a sep
arate bill, which would then find hearty
support. Boards of Trade, Chambers of
Commerce, Granges of Patrons of Hus
bandry and other organizations of pro
ducers throughout the State have sent
to Senator Perkins resolutions and me
morials praying for the passage of the
bill as it now stands, all producers
realizing the great benefits they would
derive from the general expansion or
commerce through the extension of old
and the opening of new markets.
The Senator is. therefore, surprised
that the Chamber of Commerce of San
Francisco should be put in the light
of insisting upon action that will
Jeopardize the bill.
The minority report on the Hanna-
Payne shipping bill was filed in the
House of Representatives to-day. It
was prepared by Representative Handy
cf Delaware and is a severe and some
what personal arraignment of the
measure and those who would receive
bounties under it. The report says.
The bill is one that was prepared and
brought to Congress by a voluntary com
mittee of ship-owners and ship-builders
representing the gentlemen who will re
ceive the bounty which the bill proposes
to give from the public treasury. The
bill as it is reported to the House is in
almost the exact form and grants to a
penny the bounties demanded by the gen
tlemen who are to receive them. The bill
is therefore, naturally and entirely satis
factory to the "interests" which have or
ganized this movement to secure the vast
sums carried in the bIU as a gratuity to
be used in carrying on (their private busi
ness and enlarging the profits thereof.
The bill provides not simply for boun
ties, but for bounties which, once granted,
cannot be thereafter taken away. If this
bill be passed the contracts will be quick
ly made, and, once entered into, no future
Congress can in honor break them or re
fuse to make the necessary appropriations
to pay them. To do so would be like re
pudiating a national obligation.
The twenty-year bounties provided are
put into the bill in the language of so
many cents, but when the arithmetical
computation is made to find how big the
bounties "by cents" will prove to be when
the time comes to pay them, we find that
they must be figured in tens of millions of
dollars. By careful and conservative esti
mates we find that the Government would
be obliged by the contracts likely to be
entered Into during the first twelve
months under this bill to pay bounties
amounting to more than $165,000,000. and
this includes only the shipping now In
sight, and the shipping which must be
built will cost probably not less than
$400,000,000.
Of this enormous bounty the lion's
share will go to the International Navi
gation Company. This company will re
ceive in the aggregate more than $57,000,
--000. This strikes us as a monstrous ap
propriation. In this bill it is provided that
a man who builds a great, speedy ocean
steamer shall be paid bounties In twenty
dlntely put to work, however, and late
to-night a single wire was up and in
vorkir.g order, but so burdened witn
Canadian Pacific business that corre
spondents have had little opportunity
to send out details of the havoc wrought
by the moving glacier.
From fragmentary messages sand
wiched between train orders, it is
learned that the men engulfed were
spending the noon hour in the round
house when a great mass of ice, loosen
ed by the soft weather of the last day
or two, swept down the precipice, at the
foot of which the buildings are located,
and crushed them as though made of
cardboard. There were several en-
gines in the roundhouse and a num
ber of cars in the yards adjacent.
The force of the slide was made evi
dent when the rescue party, in its en
deavors to reach the men, found a lo
comotive twisted and crushed into a.
shapeless mass of scrap iron.
Had the slide occurred before or after
the dinner hour the loss of life would
ha%-e been appalling.
Several large slides have taken place
during the morning and early after
noon, causing considerable damage to
the sheds east of Glacier. Trains are
held at Glacier end Donald until fur
ther advices. The company expects to
gret the line cleared during Wednesday.
Superintendents Marpole, Duchesnay
and Wilson are on the spot and using
every effort.
It is reported that a train ran into
the slide and was wrecked, but this
cannot be confirmed.
years amounting to twice the whole cost
of the boat.
It must be conceded that bounties are
repugnant to the spirit of our free insti
tutions, under which all citizens should
have equal rights and no special privi
leges should be granted. It is impossible
to give bounty to everybody and to all
forms of industry and it is manifestly
unequal and unjust to tax the farmers,
carpenters, blacksmiths, masons, mer
chants, railroad men, miners and woods
men of the country to pay a bounty to
ship-owners for every mile they sail upon
the sea. To build once more a great mer
chant marine should be one of the patri
otic ambitions of American statesman
ship. It can be done by taking off the
shackles and giving American enterprise,
American industry and American seaman
ship an equal chance. Everything needed
in building and equipping a ship should be
admitted free of customs duty. Ship sup
plies should also be on the free list.
Every American citizen should be free to
buy ships to use in the foreign carrying
trade wherever he can find them cheap
est and best. Tonnage taxes should be
abolished.
In conclusion the report says:
This bill is the offspring of mere bounty
beggars and should be repudiated by rep
resentatives of both political parties. It
is vicious in principle. It is not .necessary
for the rehabilitation of our merchant
marine to give hundreds of millions of
people's tax money. The bill is wholly
unjustifiable.
Mr. Fitzgerald did not concur in this
report.
HONOLULU GIRL'S
PLUNGE TO DEATH
HONOLULU, Jan. 24. â A young Ha
waiian girl named Kahea committed sui
cide on the 21st inst. by throwing herself
from the third story of the Kamehameha
School building. Relatives claim that the
girl's mind was affected by over study.
Last Saturday, accompanied by her sis
ter Violet, she went to the school to take
away her clothing, books, etc. In her
room while packing up were Miss Wond
ard and Miss Ahia, the latter a cousin.
Suddenly Miss Kahea uttered a scream
as if about to faint and asked Miss Ahea
to call her sister. At the same time she
ran toward the open window and went
over. Miss Ahia grasDed frantically after
her and caueht her dr^ss. The garment
tore loose, however, the weight of the
young woman being upon it, and the sui
cide plunged to her fearful death to the
ground forty or more feet below.
McLeod Wins From Hali Adali.
ST. PAUL, Jan. 31.â Danny McLe^od,
champion catch-as-catch-can wrestler of
America, won his match to-night with
Hali Adali, the gigantic Turkish wrestler,
and gave him sixty minutes of as hot
wrestling as has ever been seen. The
match was before the St. Paul Athletic
Club, the conditions being that Adali
should throw McLeod twice in an hour or
forfeit $1000.

SUSTAIN Tr^E SCHOOL BOORD.
rROM the way in which the new Board of Edu
cation has begun the work of retrenchment and
reform good auguries can be drawn for the fu
ture. The board has started well and is making an
earnest effort to reduce expenses in spite of an ag
gressive opposition from those who have profited by
the extravagance of former boards.
It was inevitable that this opposition and antagon
ism should confront the board in its efforts at re
form. There is no kind of abuse of public trust that
4oes not benefit somebody. Wherever there is
waste there are people who profit by it. Extravagant
and dishonest officials place upon the payrolls of the
city a far larger number of employes than are needed
for the service; they purchase supplies that are not
â¢' required, and pay tor them prices above the market
rates. In that way there is formed a considerable
company of persons _ to whom municipal extrava
â  gance is a valuable t>oon.
When a reforming administration comes in and
sets about reducing expenses to an economical basis
. all the crowd that have drawn incomes from the
abuses find themselves shut out from their former
profitable business, and then a storm breaks forth.
These people gather their friends around them and
rai.-c a howl to heaven. They circulate petitions
nmong good-natured citizens, who will sign without
reading it almost anything except a check, and pro
ceed to work up something that looks like popular
indignation against the administration that has turned
them down.
When such attacks are made upon officials who are
honestly trying to protect the public interests it is
the duty of all pood citizens to stand by them and to
speak out in their behalf. That duty, however, is
but rarely performed. When an official does wrong
all are prompt to denounce him, but when he does
light he is generally left to fight his battle alone
"against the host that has been fattening on the spoils
â  of municipal patronage. Not infrequently the very
persons who have been most clamorous for reform
turn in hostility upon the men who undertake it and
rage as fiercely as the spoilsmen themselves.
Much of that sort of injustice is now being done
toward the Board of Education in its earnest begin
ning at an economical administration of the school
fund. Instead of making use of the office as a means
of distributing patronage the new members of the
board have set about the task of placing the schools
upon a strictly business basis. The work is one
which the public has long desired, which the people
have frequently demanded â one to the performance
Hi which every political party has pledged its candi
dates in each successive campaign. Why, then,
should the citizens and taxpayers stand silent when
the spoilsmen array themselves and attack the offi
cials whose only offending is that they are keeping
their pledges and acting with fidelity toward the
. people?
The Republican party of San Francisco has a just
reason to be proud of the record which its represen
tatives on the Board of Education are making. The
; Republican board is a striking contrast to the Demo
cratic board that preceded it. The party will be
strengthened in future municipal elections by the
faithful work- now being done by these stalwart sup
porters of economy and honesty in their administra
tion of the schools. For Republicans, therefore, as
well as for independent citizens of all parties, the
duty of the hour is to sustain the board.
After Judge Hebbard had denied divorce to a
young wife the mother of the plaintiff sought out her
son-in-law and smashed him on the jaw. Possibly
this will afford opportunity for a reopening of the
case. Certainly a man with a mother-in-law of that
style could win the sympathy of the court if he were
to try.
While the human race is not lacking in sympathy,
it has difficulty in mustering up any of it for a man
who answers the advertisement of a mairiage bureau
and gets put on exhibition as a sucker.
Assemblyman Burnett may not be trained in the
.trick of oratory, but there is no doubt that he recog
nizes a square deal when he sees it, and thinks it a
pretty good thing. #
There is beginning to be a suspicion that Dan over
trained a little for his contest, and with the handi
cap of his record he is not making much progress.
Perhaps Tom Williams is at Sacramento for the
purpose of promoting legislation for the discourage
ment of horse-racing.
Tf Gomez has really demanded $60,000,000, his
chances of not getting it are good enough to bet on.
Wright's vote as a member will be exactly as valu
able as it was as Speaker.
REPUBLICANS SHOULD REFLECT.
THE CALL is battling for the integrity and the
future of Republicanism in California.
It is not a far cry backward to the beginning
of the last campaign, nor forward to the opening of
the next. Looking backward, every man in the party
recalls the fear of defeat that hung over the opening
days of the last fight. The fusion of all opposing
elements presented an imposing front and a most
powerful and threatening line of battle. When the
shock of conflict came, The Call did its full Repub
lican duty and rallied to the party ticket all of the
elements in the State which look to its welfare, prog
ress and purity of reputation. We did not then pre
tend, nor do we now make claim, that honor and
honesty are the peculiar characteristics of all Re
publicans, and that their opposites are to be found
only in the opposition. But we did and do claim
that upon the public issues presented the Republican
party represented the average aspirations and prin
ciples of the best citizenship, and therefore the party
won. It triumphed because the best citizenship felt
that it would not need to be as closely watched and
tended in power, to keep it in line with those aspira
tions, as the fusion party would require.
We here record our deep and lasting protest
against the claim that the party owed its success to
the designs and devices of any boss or bosses. That
such were around, watching the chances of the battle,
we do not deny. They were followers of both camps,
but our fight gained no vote by their presence or
their practices. It was won because the people were
with us, and to them The Call addressed itself in
ceaseless urging, as it addresses itself now.
When bad faith, corruption and immorality ap
peared at Sacramento, regardless of the effect upon
itself this paper took means to purge the party of
evil, and those means have prevailed, against more
opposition than we like to see. We are unable to
conceive how any party can expect to gain strength
by sheltering and protecting the classes against which
we have been doing battle. Does not every Repub
lican know that his party raises itself in public esti
mation by running them out of it?
Do Wright and his defenders represent California
Republicanism? If so, God help the party, for man
won't, and it can depend only on that divine mercy
which is extended to sinners.
In the Legislature a few men fret and fume and call
names and utter strange cries about us. They for
get that they are in a representative position, that
they are not there to feed their greeds or grudges or
use a position of public authority to carry out their
personal aims. They are there to so uprightly dis
charge their high public duties as to honor
the party that passed those duties to them. Can any
of these say with his conscience that he is doing this
in supporting unfit men for the Senate, in defending
the discredited and dismounted Speaker, or in doing
any of the nasty things which occupy them, to the
exclusion of the things required by the people and
honorable to the State?
We would have much preferred to have been spared
the doing of what has been necessary to expose and
punish the chief betrayer of his public trust. It is the
first case in "American politics where a party news
paper has been instrumental in elevating a man to a
legislative Speakership, believing in his honor, and
in a fortnight has been instrumental in deposing him
from his office upon knowledge of his dishonor. It
was no pleasure for us to make this public admission
that we had been deceived, that our confidence had
been betrayed, but it was a duty to arrest his career
of betrayal that he be disarmed of the power of
treachery to ot?hers.
If another paper had assumed this duty and had
discharged it as well, it would not have waited a mo
ment for the backing and approval of The Call, as
we are sure we have not lacked the support of all
right-thinking citizens of all parties.
We plead again with this Republican Legislature
to obey its highest sense of duty, and to all officers
chosen by the party to stand for the best service and
with the best aspirations of the people, and the favor
of California will not cease nor its shining face be
averted from the party of Lincoln and McKinley.
THE STOTE NOT RESIGNED.
THE resignation of the Speakership by Howard
E. Wright will not be followed by the resigna
tion of the people. They will believe that the
proceeding was a trick of Dan Burns, and they will
be quite correct. The revelations of the investigation
were bad enough on the surface, but they were worse
as they pointed to the deeper infamies, of which
there was moral but not legal proof. Dan Burns
had posed as a philanthropist who, for the benefit of
Assemblyman Merrill's friend, had bought railway
tickets from the law department of the railroad and
paid for them on the street. The ex-Speaker had
also secured transportation by the same eccentrical
method. With his soul transfixed by sharp-pointed
and jostling pledges, he had temporarily deceived
The Call by a vulgar lie. But the support of Dan
Burns and his friends had also been secured, ,pre
sumptively, by the promise that he would lie to every
one else, but not to Dan Burns. And this pledge,
which swallowed up all his other pledges, was ac
tually redeemed.
The report was as guarded as the finding of a
court, which usually expresses just enough to sus
tain the decision, but often implies a great deal more.
In the present instance, the implications were damn
ing to Dan Burns, and the situation for him was de
cidedly embarrassing. The problem before him was
how to appease the Legislature and the public, and
yet padlock Wright's tongue and hold his vote. This
was done by a coup de theatre. The shell, which was
the Speakership, was sacrificed in order that the ker
nel, which is Wright, might be preserved. After a
deadlock of weeks it was easy to speculate upon the
inclination of the other candidates, especially Grant,
and their legislative adherents, to seize any oppor
tunity to avoid the disturbance- that just punishment
by a popular body usually causes. The temporary
end crowned the work. Wright, as an innocent
bribe-taker and pledge-breaker, abandoned by some
cf his fellows, who were wondrously unkind, yielded
up the ghost as Speaker and came down to the floor,
where he was retained by a vote, unaccountable
upon principle, but politically comprehensible for rea
sons already mentioned and to prevent dynamitical
intrusions into Senatorial combinations. The argu
ment of Mr. Dibble to the effect that he who was
without sin should cast the first st6ne, and that the
Speaker had been sufficiently punished, was a re
flection upon his fellow-members that was probably
unintended. It sounded like the terse appeal of a
man charged with crime, by which he supplemented
the efforts of his counsel when he said to the jury,
"You know how it is yourselves." Wright can be
more serviceable now behind the shield of the muni
cipal Achilles. As Speaker he was handicapped. As
a floor manager he will be more in his element, and
his chicaneries overspread by a deeper shadow.
This trick may tend to load up Grant as the scape
goat and to array Wright in the toggery of a Pavian
hero who has lost all but his seat and his honor to
Daniel Burns? It may avert further disclosures and

possibly deeper investigation. But it will not adorn
the shirt of Nessus with the toga of a Senator. The
people are not resigned. The candidates who have
clean skins and decent friends have not surrendered.
j The legislators have not recast their divergent judg
ments and flocked to the camps where votes may
I command from sixteen hundred and fifty to six
thousand dollars apiece. They have not yet been
wheedled or bullied into the elevation of lawless com
petition and ignorance to the seat where greatness
may represent a nation, but where even mediocrity
is the voice of a State. Still, for all concerned there
is a future, although it is growing short.
In the bright light of the Union California ob
serves and waits. To Burns and Grant she excTaims,
"A plague on both your houses." Of the Legislature,
with kindling eyes and in ominous tones, she re
iterates her demand for a Republican, a statesman
and a gentleman.
IN the case of Ball vs. Putnam et al., appealed from
the Yolo County Superior Court over a year ago,
the Supreme Court the other day handed down a
decision which possesses more than ordinary interest
at the present time.' Indeed, it is especially applic
able to a condition which often prevails at Sacra
mento, involving, as it does, the corruption of an en
tire Legislature by an entire community.
In 1889 the people of Willows, Colusa County, con
ceived the idea that they could attain to the dignity
of a metropolis by dividing their county and creating
the county of Glenn. A bill was introduced into the
Legislature with that end in view, and subscriptions
were taken up at Willows for the purpose of paying
what was denominated the "legitimate expense" of
passing the measure. A committee was appointed,
of which J. C. Ball was made chairman, and the fund
raised was placed in his hands.
On arriving at Sacramento Ball found that one
Christopher A. Buckley had control of the Legisla
ture, and after various negotiations he agreed to pay
that famous manipulator $15,000 if he would interest
himself in the Glenn County bill. Buckley did in
terest himself in the bill and it passed both branches
of the Legislature. In the Senate a motion to re
consider was made, and .while this motion was pend
ing Buckley informed Judge Ball that $6000 more
would be required to defeat it.
The additional money was raised by negotiating a
promissory note signed by J. E. Putnam, K. E. Kel
ley, F. G. Crawford, August Henning, W. H. Kel
ley and Joseph Muller, all of whom were residents of
Willows and interested in the passage of the divi
sion bill. It was represented to these men that the
$6000 would be contributed by the Willows bank
and that putting their names to a negotiable note
meant merely an accommodation. In this way the
money was raised and paid to Buckley. Subsequently
the makers of the note refused to pay it, and Ball
began suit to recover.
This action was tried in the Superior Court of
Yolo County, whence it had been transferred by stip
ulation, and in which Ball obtained judgment for the
full amount. In his testimony at the trial Judge Ball
explained the financial part of the transaction as
follows:
My memorandum shows that I got at the Cali
fornia State Bank on March 7, $14,500, which was
paid over the counter and put in carpet sacks. Our
draft for $6000 was drawn there in the bank and
handed to the bank before the money was paid out.
It was for $6000 and $7500 was drawn on what was
known as the Glenn note and $1000 was furnished
by K. E. Kelley. I was present when the money
was paid over. The memorandum I have shows that
there was paid to Buckley $14,550, paid back to K.
E. Kelley $250 and a balance of $100. My recollection
is that all the money I got from the bank in the
morning was paid over to Buckley. I went along
with the parties that took the money from the bank
âMr. Crawford, Mr. Hill, Buck Kelley and myselfâ
and interested myself in seeing it paid over to the
party. That was part of my business to see that the
proper amount was paid over on whatever was yet
unpaid on the contract that was made by Mr. Kel
ley. Mr. Buckley received what he claimed to be
due, but what statement he made I have no recel
lection of. I had heard that there was an obligation
to be met but the exact amount I did not know. I
went there to see that he did not get more than
was due him. I did not have anything to do with
placing the money in the carpet sacks. I may have
carried one of the sacks part of the time. I did'tiot
carry both of them at any time. I have a distinct
recollection that Buckley's men did the counting.
Buckley handled It. I think he counted it. Buckley
is blind, but he can feel money. I know that he
became satisfied when he felt it that the amount
he claimed was paid to him. I think Steppacher or
Rudolph was there. When the money was paid
Steppacher, Rudolph, Buckley himself and Mrs.
Buckley were present, and there was Crawford, Jim
Hill, Buck Kelley, and there may have been others
that I have now forgotten.
This testimony is contained in the transcript on
appeal, and when the Supreme Court came to con
sider the case it of course perused it. The judgment
of the Yolo County Superior Court was reversed on
a technicality, but the Supreme Court took occasion
to say that the contract upon which the promissory
note to Ball was made was evidently against public
policy, good morals, or the express mandate of the
law, and as such that it could not be made the basis
of any action, legal or equitable; moreover, the
court added that neither silence nor the consent of
the parties justified the court in retaining jurisdiction
of such an action.
Probably this reversal will settle the litigation for
ever, but the case is interesting at this time because it
throws a side light upon the way in which some leg
islation is procured at Sacramento. Here an entire
community conspired to corrupt a Legislature, and
in doing it their authorized committee openly and
in the presence of a large number of persons paid
$15,000 to a political boss for his influence in passing
a bill. The interesting question is, how much did
Buckley pay the Senators and Assemblymen for their
votes? Another interesting question is how often
has this process been repeated, and is it being re
peated at Sacramento at the present time?
According to Expert Yale, California has many
as rich mines as the one in which a wonderful strike
of gold has been made in Colorado. This is good
news, and confirmation of it through mint returns
will be welcome.
Works and Johnson seem to lack the sense of
humor so utterly a^ not to be able to discern any
fun in the situation they have devised for themselves,
and they even begrudge the fun the artists are having.
Dibble's allusion to the attitude of Christ toward
the Pharisees, was most irreverent and unseemly. An
orator should have some regard for his environment.
Among other things, the Board of Education has
won the disapproval of the Post. While this is not
much, still in a small way it is a triumph.
The Senate has elected about two score clerks
since the passage of the Cutter bill, which is probably
at least four times more than needed.
Matters at Sacramento are* rather quiet, since a
week has passed without any statesman having spat
in the eye of another.
c RECORD OF BRIBERY.
HEALTH BOARD
MAKES MANY
REDUCTIONS
Salaries and Expenses
Curtailed.
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS SAVED
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DE
PARTMENT IMPAIRED.
Nine Employes Dismissed From the
Service and Sweeping Reduc
tions Made Wherever
Possible.
The Board of Health has followed the
example of the Board of Education and
has revolutionized the department over
which it presides. At a special meeting
yesterday five food inspectors were dis
missed, together with the cigar factory
inspector, bath and laundry inspector, as
sistant vaccinating officer and assistant
to the bacteriologist.
This, with the reduction of the allow
ances for incidental expenses of the at
taches of the department and reduction,
in wages of others, will result in a sav
ing of $835 per month. Without reducing
the effectiveness of the officers who con
serve the health of the city it will per
mit of the present board retiring from of
fice without the deficit which has in
variably marked each change of adminis
tration.
An executive session of the board was
held at 11 o'clock, at which the proposed
changes recommended by the Finance
Committee were dismissed. An hour later
an open meeting was held. The report of
the Finance Committee, which consists of
Dr. R. W. Baum and Dr. J. W. William
son, was read as follows:
In accordance with instructions Issued at
the last meeting of the board directing the
Finance Committee to take steps necessary
to expunge the deficit at present existing
in the funds of the department, the com
mittee herewith submits for your approval
the following proposition:
Firstâ Reduction In transportation account
as follows: Chief Food Inspector Dockery,
allowed $55, should be reduced to $25; Chief
Plumbing Inspector Sullivan, allowed $30,
should be reduced to $25; Chief Market In
spector Ben Davis, allowed $30, should be
reduced to $25; Veterinary Surgeon I. W.
O'Rourke, allowed $25 per month, should be
reduced to $20 per month; Police Officer
Butterworth, reduced from $30 to $25.
Second â Reduction in number of assistant
food Inspectors: Five inspectors, each re
ctlvlng a salary of $75 per month, should
be dropped from the pay roll of the depart
ment.
Third â The following: reductions in salaries
of employes at Park Emergency Hospital:
Two drivers, each receiving $75 per month,
ehould be reduced to $60; two matrons, each
receiving $60 per month, should be reduced
to $50. This will effect a saving of $50 per
month In the Park Hospital alone.
Fourth â The salary of Veterinary Surgeon
I. W. O'Rourke should be reduced from $150
to $100 per month.
Fifthâ The salary of Bacteriologist Pr.
John Spencer should be reduced from $150
to $100 per month.
Sixth â The position of assistant vaccinat
ing officer should be abolished; amount
saved, $50.
Seventhâ The position of bath and laundry
Inspector, salary $75, be abolished.
Eighth â The position of cigar factory In
spector, salary $75, be abolished.
Ninthâ the salaries of two assistant plumb-
Ing inspectors, receiving $100 per month, be
reduced to $75.
Tenthâ The salaries of the two Inspectors of
garbage transportation:, at $100, be reduced
to $73.
Eleventhâ The position of assistant to the
bacteriologist, salary $35 per month, be
abolished.
The report was accepted, and in keeping
with its recommendation the following
men were dismissed from the department:
Food Inspectors W. Hrennan, IT
O'Donnell, W. McHugh, P. A. Cadogan J.
J. Sullivan.
Cigar Factory Inspector R. B. Porter.
Bath and Laundry Inspector P. Lydon.
Assistant Vaccinating Officer Dr.
Phipps.
Assistant to Bacteriologist Andre Des
soulavy.
Two appointments wore announcedâ J.
Cabal was made garbage inspector, vice
Frank Corbett, resigned; John Thomas
was appointed assistant food inspector.
Salaries were fixed at $75 per month.
The bill of C. H. Taylor, a special nurse
at the Pesthouse, for $150 salary and $33 35
clothes destroyed, was allowed. It was
determined that hereafter no allowance
will be made for clothes destroyed.
The changes in the department take
effect to-day.

An article appeared in The Call of

the principal of the Lockwood School
punishing a child. The only truth in the
article was that he punished the child
deservedly and not unduly. He simply
performed his duty in preserving the or

when his trial comes off. They need only
to be known to completely exonerate him.

ed for One Year.

OR TO VERIFY COMPASS.
Although Warned That the Surf
Could Be Heard Ahead He
Nevertheless Drove Upon.
the Reef.
Captain William F. Daniels, late of
the coasting steamer Noyo, will for the
next year to come take his bearings and
lay out his course on dry land, and the
briny deep will know him no more save
as a passenger or a swimmer.
United States Local Inspectors Bolles
and Bulger yesterday published their
findings 'accusing him of being respon
sible for the wreck of the Noyo by rea
son of gross negligence.
The steamer, with twenty-seven pas
sengers and a cargo of lumber, went
ashore on January 17 on Duxbury Reef,
about nine miles from the northwest
entrance of San Francisco Bay. She
was damaged to the extent of $4000 and
her passengers and crew were saved
in the. lifeboats and were transferred
to the steamer Henrietta,
Just before the Noyo was run upon
the reef the report states that she was
running at full speed in a thick fog
and her whistles were sounding at reg
ular intervals. At 4 o'clock in the
morning the second mate informed the
chief mate that he heard the roaring
of the surf. The chief mate called up
the captain, and the captain said the
mate must be mistaken, that they could
not be that close to the shore according
to the course they were steering. In
spite of the doubt the captain allowed
the steamer to go ahead at full speed
through the fog, nor did he change her
course, or take soundings. At 4:50 a.
m. the steamer ran upon the reef and
was saved from sinking only by the
buoyancy of the lumber with which she
was loaded.
Captain Daniels was convicted on his
own testimony principally. He swore
that there was no deviation card on
board the Noyo and that he had never
"swung" the vessel to get the deviation
of the compass. On the previous trip
he had ascertained the deviation on
south by east, south-southeast and
southeast-by-south courses, but he
could not be sure that they were cor
rect as there was quite a swell on at
the time. He had never got the devia
tion by courses east of southeast by
south.
The report goes on to say that the
inspectors are of the opinion that Cap
tain Daniels was negligent and unskill
ful in navigating the steamer.
Firstâ ln leaving the deck in charge
of the second mate when so near the
land in a fog, especially as he did not
know the deviation of the compass on
the course steered after passing Point
Reyes.
Second â In running at full speed in
the fog.
Thirdâ ln not taking 1 soundings when
he came on deck at 4 o'clock.
The report goes on to say that had
he taken a cast of the lead at that time
he would have seen that the steafrner
was near the land and he would have
averted the disaster.
His license as master was therefore
suspended for one year.
The sentence would have been much
more severe had it not been for the
admirable manner in which the captain
acted in getting the passengers and
crew into lifeboats and saving them
from further accident.

Acompanyingr the bound volume con
taining the list of persons to whom wa
ter was supplied was the following letter:
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors
of the City and County of San Francisco
. Gentlemen: Herewith is presented to your
honorable board the annual report of the
Sprine Valley Water Works for the year
1838. As you will observe from the report,
the year has required more than the aver
age annual expenditure for permanent im
provements â the total sum amounting to
$1,174,973 13. This has been required in the
necessary construction of the new San
Andreas pipe lines, the new Locks Creek
pipe line, the Milpitas pumping plant, the
Crystal Springs pumping plant and other
permanent Improvements, all made neces
sary by the demands arising upon the com
pany during the year. You will also ob
serve an Increase in the operatlne ex
â¢ pensea, occasioned by the extra amount of
pumping necessarily done on account of the
â  dry season, to meet the demand ror water.
This extra expense amounts in round num
bers to $85,000 more than for the preceding
yearâ the total for the year 1898 being $458,
--750 SO, and the total for the preceding year -
but $388,364 27. The difference between\these
; last two sums is less than the extra cost
of pumping, such difference being $24,514,
thus showing that the operating expenses in
the aggregate in other departments was that
much less during the year 1898 than In 1897.

OTHER UPSETS AT OAKLAND
TOM CROMWELL BEATEN OUT BY
MISTLETON.
Romany Left the Maiden Class.
Abuse Romped In After Miss
Rowena Had Run Away.
Four Choices Downed.
Horsemen from the State of Montana
are rapidly acquiring an enviable reputa
tion in local turf circles for sending good
things to the post. Perhaps after the de
feat of Montanus in the third event a,t
Oakland yesterday, longer odds will be
obtainable against thoroughbreds from
the silver and copper regions. It was a
seven furlong run, and Montanus, the
entry of Billy Randall, was heralded far
ar..l wide as money from the old folks. He
was "father's horse" and make no mis
take, so his price when the betting opened
was rapidly slashed from 2 to 1 to even
change. Builman was the driver, and
managed to get his mount away fairly
well. In front for a few inches In the
run home, the Montana colt could not
etretch it out, finishing third. Whaleback,
ridden by Spencer, came from nowhere
and led Ranier out a head. The winner
was second choice in the betting. It is safe
to predict that longer odds will hence
forth be laid against horsea from the
northwestern country.
It must have been that the cold north
ern wind that blew over the course froze
the blood in the veins- of more than one
favorite. Six heavily backed ones were
Intrusted to the care of Mr. Ferguson,
and but two managed to come back in
front with the money. The attendance
was not as large as on the preceding day.
Romany, at odds of 5 to 2, carried off
. the laurels to be gained in the opening
sprint at the Futurity distance. The geld
ing was ridden by Cash Sloan, and in a
drive downed the 12 to 1 shot Glengaber a
head. Master I.cc, the favorite, was
Â third.
â  The favorite Bet up to win the five fur
â¢ long scramble that followed proved a very
: unreliable one. It was Campus, and not
. unlike many other first choices fell Into
.. third place. Espirando, a 7 to 1 chance,
.â¢with Thorpe In the saddle, won all the
.way. Anchored at odds of 25 to 1 was a
, handy second.
' â â¢' In the mile and a furlong selling affair
Mistleton. also ridden by Thorpe, made a
â I remarkable run. At the head of the
' Ftretch, looking hopelessly out of it,
- Thorpe lueexed through next the rail

. Guilder finished a close third. The win

Guilder was almost as short.

THE CALIFORNIA SOPRANO.
Mme. Agnes Fried s First Appear
ance in This City.
A large and very friendly audience
greeted Mme. Agnes Fried, the San
Francisco soprano, who has been abroad
for sirae years, at the Sherman &. Clay
Hall last evening. This is the first time
she appeared professionally in this city
and the nervousness that marked her
work in the aria from "Sanisoi and
Delilah" wore off as the concert pro
gressed.
She Is embarrassed - her enunciation
by a slight lisp, but her voice has the
great merit of being true. In ballads
she appears to better advantage than in
arias. She was given two encores and a
profusion of beautiful flowers.
Hilda Newman, who has been studying
in Europe for some time, has a few
mannerisms when at the piano, but she
played Chopin's "Polonaise" in E flat in
a way that won the house. She also ap
peared to good advantage in Beethoven's
Sonata, Op. 30, No. 2. for violin and
piano. Giulio Minettl was the violinist
of the evening. He Is heard so often hls_
playing requires no comment.
Mm*. Fried assisted by the same
artists, will give her last concert at the
same hall Saturday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock, when a new programme will be
rendered.

MARTIN SKOUGLUND ARRESTED
Believed to Be the Leader of the Gang
of Bay Pirates Which Has Been
Robbing Mare Island.
Martin Skouglund, alias Martin Lund,
who is believed to be the ring
leader of the gang which has
been systematically pilfering copper and
brass castings from the navy-yard at
Mare Island, was arrested yesterday and
lodged in the City Prison. He will be
turned over to the United States Marshal
and tried with other members of the gang
in tho I'nited States District Court.
Theso pilferings at Mare' Island have
been going on for a long time, and the
goods stolen aggregate thousands of dol
lars in value. John Helm was captured
â¢in Mare Island Sunday morning-, and
through his confessions Arthur Daught
was also taken In charge by the police and
suspicion was thrown on Skouglund. who
escaped in a boat when Helm was caught.
It is said that the men became acquainted
with the location of the stores when
working on the quay wall extension. The
authorities are confident that they have
a perfect case and will secure conviction.
Whipping Post Wanted.
James Lyman, a shoemaker from Wat
sonville who deserted his wife and three
children and came to the city with an
other woman, was convicted by Judge
Mogan yesterday of failure to provide.
Lyman's conduct to his little crippled
daughter was so brutal that the Judge
denounced him roundly and expressed the
hope that before the legislature adjourn
ed a bill would be introduced and passed
providing the whipping-post for wife
beaters and men who desert their families
and give their earnings to some other
woman.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1899.
TO BRING THE
CALIFORNIA
BOYS HOME
Relatives Meet for
That Purpose.
ENCOURAGING REPORTS READ
WELL RECEIVE THE REGIMENT
ON ITS RETURN.
Father Doherty Delivers a Patriotic
Speech Urging Maintenance of
the Organization Amid
Great Enthusiasm.
There was an enthusiastic gathering of
the relatives of the First California
Volunteers at Native Sons' Hall last
night. Fully five hundred ladles and
gentlemen were present to voice their
sentiments in regard to the return of the
boys from Manila and to hasten, if pos
sible, the action of the Government in
bringing about the desired object.
After an introductory speech by Chair
man Moores, in -which he said he had
received positive assurance that the Cali
fornia Volunteers would be returned
home soon, W. A. Derham read the re
port of the executive committee. Ho
stated that Assistant Secretary Melkle
john sent a communication that six regi
ments would be ordered back and the
California Volunteers would be among
the first to reach home. He also read a
telegram from Senator Perkins, in which
Perkins said he would use his best en
deavors to help In the good cause.
Rev. Father Doherty delivered a stir
ring speech which roused his hearers to a
pitch of great enthusiasm. He paid a
beautiful tribute to the splendid spirit
and courage of the California boys and
said the regiment, from the colonel down,
were a unit in the desire to return home.
Father Doherty requested the assem
blage to do all !n Its power to facilitate
the return and advised the maintenance
of the organization until the day the
regiment was marching again in the
streets of San Francisco.
William Ehrenpfort and Joseph Binet,
whose boys are with their companies in
Manila, urged active co-operation of the
relatives. The former presented five
petitions signed by many prominent mer
chants of this city asking for the return
fo the volunteers, and these will be sent
to Washington to join the others now at
the department.
A motion was made by C. E. Mueller to
appoint a reception committee and the
chair appointed W. A. Derham, A. L.
Badt, C. Mueller, Mrs. Reay and Mrs.
Baird.
It was the sense of the meeting that a
register be signed by one representative
for each member of the regiment, as a
preliminary to permanent organization. A
roster of the regiment will be placed at
the Russ House and at the office of A. L.
Badt. on the northeast corner of Post and
Taylor streets, and the parents or
guardians of the absent soldiers may
sign the roll at these places. The
executive committee will arrange for an
other meeting when the register is com
plete. _^________
By the Way,
The place to enjoy a meal to the fullest extent
is the Cafe Zinkand. â¢
TANGLE OF
LOVE CAUSED
KNOTTED QUEUES
Servant Admired His
Employer's Wife.
THE LADY RECIPROCATED
YOU KEE DISCOVERED THE SE
CRET LOVE OF HIS SPOUSE.
He Discharged Wong Now, the Of
fender, and Withheld the Wages
Dve â Husband and Lover
Fight It Out.
Because Wong Now loved the young
wife of his employer. You Kee. he re
ceived no wages for the work he did and
lost his position in Kee's laundry. Late
yesterday afternoon the husband and the
lover met at the corner of Jackson and
Dupont streets, and an argument over
the situation ended In blows. The Celes
tial pugilists fought furiously until Police
man "Tommy" Naylor arrived on the
scene and arrested both for disturbing
the peace.
A large crowd had collected to witness
the fight, and when Naylor arrived on the
scene he had a hard time to niake hia
way to the principals in the disturbance.
When he finally reached them his work
was but half finished, for in the melee the
queues of the scrappers had become en
tangled, and so fierce was the anger of the
two Chinamen that they did not wish to
be separated.
The story of the origin of the trouble is
another tale of the marriage of May and
December. You Kee, who is well along
In years, some moons ago wedded the
woman who is now his wife when she
was but 20 years old. For a time You
Kee lived happily with hl3 young wife,
and she appeared to reciprocate the love
he gave her. She soon tired of her lord
and master, however, and while not seek
ing for one she could love, often thought
that her lot was a hard one.
Recently Wong Now appeared on the
scene. He was employed by You Kee, and
for a time all went well. The wife noticed
Wong Now, and found him fair to look
upon. Wong Now, for his part, admired
the pretty wife of his employer, but dared
not covet her, thinking she was too much
above him In station. As time went on
he became more bold, and. encouraged by
the glances of the lady, avowed his love.
The affection existing between the serv
ant and his mistress was concealed from
You Kee for a long time, but he finally
became aware of the unfaithfulness of his
wife Instead of visiting her sins upon
her head, he made Wong Now pay the
penalty for his own and that of his mis
tress. You Kee discharged the servan',
and, telling Wong Now the reason for his
dismissal, refused to pay him the wages
due him.
Wong Now disliked the idea of losing
both his money and hia love, and last
night, when he met You Kee, he upbraid
ed him for withholding his wages. You
Kee told his former servant that if he
would promise to cease attempting to see
his wife the money would be paid. At
first Wong Now agreed, hut his love over
coming his greed for gold, he haughtily
informed You Kee that nothing could kill
the love he had for the wife and that he
would not be bought off for the few dol
lars due him. The fight followed.
THE TWENTY-SECOND
ABOARD THE TRANSPORTS
THE MEN ARRIVED FROM NE
BRASKA YESTERDAY.
Ohio and Senator Will Be Beyond
the Golden Gate by Sundown
To-Night.
The Twenty-second Infantry arrived at
the water front yesterday morning and
immediately boarded the transports Ohio
and Senator. There was a dearth of senti
ment in their coming and going, and the
customary gathering of leavetakers and
sorrowing friends was not there. Except
for the police who were on deck, the men
might have believed that they had stolen
upon the city of San Francisco and taken
it unawares.
After a brilliant record on Cuban soil,
they sail to-day for the Philippines. They
are a body of well-behaved and trim-look
ing men, and their short stay at the docks
was without Incident. Two companies,
composing the First Battalion, were
marched on board the Senator at Broad
way dock, and four companies, composing
the Second Battalion, went to the Pacific
street dock. A number of recruits from
the Presidio marched aboard the Senator
yesterday afternoon.
The troops have been assigned to the
transports Senator and Ohio as follows:
On the Senator will go the headquarters
and band of the Twenty-second Infantry,
numbering 24 men. 100 men of Company A,
96 of B, 105 of D. 95 of H, 102 of K. 102 of
M, 19 officers, the wives of 10 officers, s
hospital men, 20 recruits of the Twenty
second Infantry, 1 officer and 20 men of
the Twentieth Infantry, making a total
of 682 enlisted men and 31 officers. Colonel
Egbert will be in command.
On the Ohio will go 92 men of Company
C, 98 of E, 100 of F, 90 of G, 105 of 1, 95 of
L, 13 officers, the wives of 7 officers, 6
hospital men and 170 casuals and recruits
from the Presidio, making a total of 760
men and 42 officers. Major L. O. Parker
will be in command of the Ohio.
The Twenty-second has distinguished
Itself in the Cuban campaign, and has lost
from its ranks many officers and men,
either in battle or by sickness. Colonel
Wykoff. who was In command, was shot
dead, and Lieutenant Colonel Patterson,
who is now second In command, was bad
ly wounded in the fight at San Juan Hill.
Captain Mozler, senior captain, was

mander, was shot twice through the body
while commanding the Sixth Infantry in
the assault on El Caney.
Companies D, G. H and I, Eighth Cali
fornia, were mustered out at the Van
couver barracks yesterday by Captain
Taylor, Fourteenth Infantry, mustering
out officer. They will proceed directly to
their homes. Company M, which was at
Alcatraz, and Companies F and L, which
â were at Angel Island, having gone
through their mustering-out ceremony on
Sunday, arrived at their respective homes
in San Jose, Oakland and Marysville last
night. The three companies at the Pre
sidio will be mustered out on Thursday
morning, and the headquarters and Com
panies A and X at Benicia barracks next
Monday, February 6.
Several female nurses were assigned to
the transports, and will report for duty
at Manila. Captain D. A. Smith of the
Eighth Infantry has been promoted as
captain of Company B. vice Captain Part
ridge. The customary monthly Teview
and inspection of the troops at the Pre
sidio took place yesterday morning.
FAVORS IMPROVEMENTS.
Advocates the Panhandle Proposition
and More Lights.
The Point Lobos Improvement Club
placed itself on record at a meeting last
night as being in favor of bonding the
city for the purpose of extending the
park panhandle to Van Ness avenue and
also the side wing crossing Richmond and
linking the two big- parksâ Golden Gate
with the Presidio reservation. The few
blocks sought to be acquired by the city
crossing Richmond by way of Fourteenth
avenue can be purchased now as cheaply
as they ever will be; therefore the club
indorses the scheme unanimously.
For local Improvements the club passed
a resolution requesting the Park Commis
sioners to open a driveway from First
avenue into the park at Fulton street.
Also requesting the Supervisors to fur
nish the Richmond district with more
electric lights, particularly on the north
ern side along the line of the Bteamcar
route to the Cliff house and in front of
the Maria Kip Orphanage.
Indelagade on Trial.
Guiseppe Indelagade, who shot and
killed his brother-in-law, Antonio Scla
fina, on Fishermen's wharf a few months
ago, was pjaced on trial before Judge
Lawler yesterday. Reel B. Terry repre
sents the prisoner and is confident, as
Sclafina was found with a knife clenched
between his stiffened fingers, that he will
clear his client on the ground of self de
fense. It is well known that Sclafina
abused his brother-in-law on various oc
casions and at one time drew a knife for
I the purpose of ending Indelagade's life,
i He would have succeeded had it not been
] for the interference of bystanders. The
I Jury was secured and the first witness
put on the stand when the hour of ad
journment came and the case went over
until this morning.
Wife Brutally Beaten.
Mrs. Mary Zand, wife of August Zand,
735 Natoma street, swore to a complaint
before acting Police Judge Barry yester
day afternoon for his arrest for battery.
Her gave her a terrific beating with some
heavy instrument and she bore the marks
on her face and body. She had a baby
three months old. Zand is foreman in
the Teutonla Bakery. The Judge made
his bonds $1000.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 31.â The average recession
in stock values to-day was fractional. There
was no oronounced pressure to sell, as was
Ehr-iwti by the diminished volume of business.
There were transactions in about 750,000 sharps,
which formerly would have been considered
a large days business, but which is the small
est amount traded in in sometime for a full-day
â  London continued a moderate Belief
on balance and thÂ» market showed alternate
spells of strength and weakness. There was
considerable telling for Chicago account; the
traders were free sellers at the opening and ;
prices ran oft fractionally except for declines i
of a point and over In Reading first preferred. !
New York Central and Tennessee Coal and ;

not developing as well as expected. Central

way preferred. American Cotton Oil and some
other specialties were consistently strong. A
us bear attack which was particularly
ri:rÂ» teii against Sugar caused that stock to
drop off four points from the high price which
had attained on a continuance of the talk of
some arrangement with the Glucose Sugar Re
fining Company. The facts concerning the
company's intentions are, of course, known
only to insiders. New York Airbrake took a
dive of about seven points. There was activ

ment stocks. Including New York, New Haven
an.! Hartford, which touched 204; Great North
ern rrercrr^d. which made a new high record
of 176; Consolidated Gas, which touched 204Vj.
and Brooklyn Union Gas, 14SV*. The strength
of these two gas stocks was on various con
solidation rumors. In regard to the strength
of Great Northern stocks there was gossip
that there might be another '"melon" to bÂ»
cut by the company perhaps in yhp form of
some distribution to the stockholders. The
time for such action was clothed In much mys
tery. Generally speaking th* market went
through the process of digesting recent realiz
ing sales, and speculation in them was largely
centered In the, sxjecialtles.

easier tendency toward the close. Total sales,

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 31.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London ' financial ' cablegram says:
There was less activity in the. markets here to
day. The tone was reactionary early, but the
clc>ee was firmer. 1 The movements were small,
however, except In specialties. Americans
were sold early and were very quiet until after |
hours in the street, when they turned .good. i
The only excitement was in Central Pacific, j
which was bought heavily by arbitrage dealers. |
It 'was said that the scheme of reorganization ;
has been decided on and would be out in a !
week or fortnight. An unnamed rumor has" it
that one Central Pacific share will get one j
Southern Pacific share and 20 per cent of 4
per cent Southern Pacific bonds to be iet-ued ;
and that there will be no assessment. This is |
regarded in good quarters as absurd, but the
market talks of Central Pacific at 65.
Copper Jumped a pound. TintOl were 37%.
Anacondas touched 9 3-16 and closed at 8!Â£.
The two large corporations organized last
week with an aggregate ' capital of ' $50,000,000 i
for 4 the purpose of making enamel ware In
Competition with each other are about to be â¢
amalgamated, - all the differences between the
organizers of the two corporations having, it is
said, been ' settled. The companies concerned
are the National Enameling and Stamping j
Company, capital $30,000,000, and the National I
Tin Plate and Enamel Ware Company, with a j
capital of $20,000,000. With the first-named I
company Is included in the arrangement the
St. Louis Tin Plate Company, with a capital
of $1,000,000.

â  CHICAGO MARKET.
1 CHICAGO. Jan. 31.â The Government report,
! which showed a yield of 375,000,000 bushels of
t wheat last year, gave wheat a weak start.
j May opened %Â®%c lower, at 76%@76%c, and as
] the outlook was rendered more unfavorable by
I a sharp slump at Liverpool; May declined to
â  76c. The extremely cold weather, with the
! unprotected condition of the winter wheat,
! caused more or less apprehension of damage !
to the plant, and as there were many reports I
to that effect buying became quite general,
while May advanced slowly to 76% c. As the
session advanced foreigners were reported to
be selling at the seaboard, while New York.
St.-' Louis and the Northwest had liberal selling
orders here. That discouraged holders and a
season of active liquidation set in, which car
ried prices off pretty steadily. Bradstreet's vle
lble showed 272,000 bushels decrease in stocks
of wheat in this country and 400,000 decrease in
and afloat for Europe. Longs abandoned their I
holdings and the selling became so aggressive
that May Flld off to 74%@74?ic, where it closed,
a decline of 2%@2>/ic for the day.
Bearish Government figures and the low Liv
erpool cables started corn weak. A good de
mand from commission houses sprang up and
the market developed a good deal of strength.
The radical weakness In wheat near the close
displaced all other considerations and the de
cline was rapid. May closed Vi6%c lower.
There was considerable liquidation in oats,
and as the buying was scattered the market
ruied weak and lower. May lost %c.
There was nothing in the provisions situa
tion to disturb holders, but the opening de
cline 1n wheat and subsequent much heavier
loss in value of that commodity demoralized
weak holders and a decline set in all around

THE RAISIN OUTLOOK. ,
NEW TORK, Jan. SLâ ThÂ« Journal of Com
merce pays:
It Is said by a number of local distributors
that the Rai6ln Growers' Association has been
a success so far as It has shown Its ability to
maintain prices, yet there Beems a good doal
of dissatisfaction expressed In EaHtern trade
with the methods employed by that organiza
tion, the chief of which appears to be that
there â  was so much of ungraded goods sold at
a compratlvely low price that it prevented the
holders of graded stock disposing of their
goods as freely or as at full prices as they
thought they should. As a large percentage
of loose muscatel raisins now- go Into con
sumption in seeded form, the fact of there
being two grades loose, is said to have thrown
the bulk of the trade, of .seeders lately to the
Pacific as being cheaper and apparently in
seeded form as acceptable 'to consumers as
graded goods. The best trade,' however, has
always discriminated . between the two, with
the result that while seeded stock prepared
from graded raisins has found a .good outlet
and loose graded muscatels have sold well, un
graded or Pacific, on account of comparatively
low prices, has curtailed consumption of the
former to a considerable extent. Some specula
tion as to whether the, association will be able
to maintain Its position for another season or
â¢ not in view of the -antagonism -'to its methods
developed In Eastern markets during the past
few months is being Indulged In.

THE LIFE OF
T. H. REYNOLDS
Died at the Home for
Incurables.
WAS ONCE DAN BURNS' DEPUTY
HIS LITE WAS ONE OF VARIED
FORTUNES.
The Fatal Disease First Attacked
Him Ten Years Ago in
the City of
Mexico.
Thomas H. Reynolds, who had a long
and varied career in this State, died at
the King's Daughters' Home for Incura
bles Monday evening from locomotor
ataxia, or paralysis of the muscles. He
had contracted the disease in 1,^9. It is
said to have been the result of inhaling
foul gases while he was engaged In super
intending the building of sewers in the
City of Mexico ten years ago.
Mr. Reynolds was born In Buffalo, N.
T. on October 4. 1839, and In 1851 came to
California with his father, who had al
ready spent two years In the gold mines.
The elder Reynolds bought the old Union
Hotel, at Merchant and Kearnv .streets,
* , u ran lt unUl 1856 Â» when his connection
with the Vigilantes made him unpopular
and ruined his business. Then Tom Rey
nolds set out to care for himself.
He rode a ny express between Uklah
and eaverville until 1860, when he began
riding on the overland route. He was
married in 1860 to a young widow, sister
in-law of Charles F. Reed of the famous
Nevada Bank wheat deal. Two children
were the fruit of this union. The. daugh
ter, Minnie, still survives. The son,
Charles D. Reynolds, was on the police
force In this city for a long time, and is
now assaver of the Hidalgo mine in Chi
huahua, Mexico.
Soon after his marriage Reynolds gave
up express riding and came to San Fran
cisco to live. He worked as bookkeeper
for San Ravelley, the well known printer,
until 1565, when he was appointed Consta
ble. Two years later he was made clerk of
the Board of Supervisors, and filled that
. position until 1875, when he was elected
County Clerk on the Democratic ticket.
In 1576 he was accused by members of
his own party of having stuffed the reg
istration rolls in the interest of the Repub
. licans. He strenuously protested his in
nocence, and one result of the charge
was that he left the Democratic party
and joined the opposition. The Republi
cans nominated him in 1577 and he was
elected by an Increased majority. He
served out his term and In 1880. when
Dan Burns was elected Secretary of State,
he appointed Reynolds his deputy.
He and Burns accused each other of
the embezzlement of that 530,000 of State
. funds. Reynolds' defense exhausted his
capital, but he began business againâ
this time renting the' gas works at Val
lejo. There he made some money, and in
. 18SS he went to the City of Mexico, and in
partnership with ex-City Surveyor W. P.
Reynolds secure a contract to equip the I
'â .-â  city with a sewer system. There he was
. taken with the illness that ended his life.
'.. For several years he had been absolutely
'.: retired from activity of any sort, and was
'' an inmate of the hospital where he died.
Mr. Reynolds was a Mason, a member
of the A. O. U. XV. and a Pioneer. The
â¢ : Society of California Pioneers will direct
â  his funeral. , .
THE KENNEDY MURDER.
Mrs. Sohnnan Testifies to His Desire !
to Be Rid of Mrs. Eagan.
The preliminary examination of Mrs.
Elizabeth Regan charged with the mur
der of Policeman Kennedy was continued
.before Judge Graham yesterday morning.
Only three witnesses were examined.
Policeman J. F. Sheehan testified that
Kennedy told him last October that he !
was to be married to the "artist girl"
and asked him to stand up with him.
Nicholas Mieholovlch, a restaurant keep
er at Sixtenth and Mission streets, tes- â 
tifled that Kennedy and Mrs. RÂ«gan used
to eat there almost regularly about a !
year ago.
Mrs. Sohrman, mother of Kennedy's |
fiancee, testified that Kennedy was at her
house the night before he was killed. He
had a pistol which he said did not suit ;
him and that he had given his other one 1
to Mrs. Regan. Her daughter gave him
a pistol, and she identified it as the one j
with which he was shot. Kennedy wore !
hlfi gold watch that night. Kennedy
wanted to marry the daughter of the wit- ;
ness In San Jose on New Year's day. say- j
ing that was the only way he could get
rid of Mrs. Regan.
The case will be continued this morning.
Patriotism Appreciated.
Lincoln Post No. 1. G. A. R., evidently

POSTUM CEREAL.
AT INEBRIATE INSTITUTE
Whiskey and Coffee Classed To-
gether.
"As manager of the Keeley Institute
of North Con way, N. H., for over three
yoars, during which time some 3000
patients were under my care, I can
pp.fak with a certain degree of positive-
n<=-sB as to the injurious effects of coffee
upon the nerves, and the beneficial ef-
fects of Postum Cereal Food Coffee,
. when properly boiled.
"We find, a? you say. that neither the
flavor nor the food value can be ex-
tracted until after 15 or 20 minutea of j
actual boiling. It does not answer to!
Pimply allow it to stand on a warm
ttove for a few minutes.
CXIFTON J. BAILEY,
Boston, Mass.
ROOM 7?, GLOBE fcULDING.
"I can most heartily indorse Postum
and advise nervous people to use It in
place of coffee or tea.
"Upon the nerves of many, coffee acts
â with the same poisoning effoct as
liquor, morphia and tobacco, and. while
acting as a stimulant, the reaction is
the same as liquor or morphia. In my
own case, I find great benefit from
using Postum Cereal Food Coffee,
â¢whereas I find nothing but harm In

AFXEET of coasting schooners took advantage of the change in the wind yesterday and came flying into
port. At 6 in the morning it was blowing six miles an hour from the southeast and at 2 in the afternoon
it was piping along at thirty-six miles an hour from the northwest. Old skippers say that when the
wind goes back to the southeast again it will rain. '
HAD TWO WOMEN
STOWAWAIS ON
THE AUSTRALIA
Beat Their Way to
the Hawaiian Isles.
FEARED THE ARCHER'S CREW
WEALTHY PASSENGER BY THE
BARXENTINE INSANE.
Licenses for Captains and Mates.
Man Drowned From Steamer
Australia â A Fleet of
Coasters Arrive.
The wind chopped around very suddenly
yesterday and brought a fleet of coasting
schooners into port. In the morning it
was blowing 6 miles an hour from the
southeast, and at 2 p. m. it was bowling
along at the rate of 3>3 miles an hour from
the northwest. Shipping men say it will
blow pretty hard for the next twenty-four
hours, after which we will get a southerly
breeze and rain.
Among the vessels that made an an
chorage was the schooner William Ren
ton, which for twenty days was beating
her way' against adverse winds. She sail
ed from Tacoma on January 11 and had
little else but light winds, head winds
and calms until she ran Into the nor'west
er. The schooners Sacramento 8 days
from TiHamook, Jennie Thelin and Emma
Utter 7 days from Grays Hardor. Ocean
Spray 4 days from Iverson's Landing,
Parkersburg 5 days from Coquille River
and Sparrow 3 days from Eureka also got
in.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia from Honolulu was also among the
arrivals. She brought up a very large
cargo, but not many passengers. Among
those who came up in the steerage were
Mrs. M. Butler and Miss C. Butler. They
came here originally from SaJita Clara in
search of work. They could not get any
thing to do in San Francisco, and hearing
that business was booming in Honolulu
they determined to go there. Mother and
daughter were without funds and how to
reach the Paradise of the Pacific was at
first a question they could not solve.
Finally they resolved to stow themselves
away on the steamer Alameda which left
here a month ago. They were soon dis
covered, and when the vessel reached
Honolulu they were turned over to the
authorities. When the Australia arrived
from San Francisco they were put aboard
her and brought back here.
The women are both honest and hard
working, and assert that they will stow
themselves away on some other vessel and
land in Hawaii again, no matter what
comes or goes. The mother gives her age
as 37 and the daughter as 17 years. They
left the Australia as soon as she docked.
"Xo one could have treated us better
than did the officers on the Alaroeda and
Australia," said Mrs. Butler yesterday.
"We expected to find everybody angry on
the Alameda when they found us out, but
they weren't. We proved that we had no
money and only wanted work, so the pur
ser said no more about it and gave us
quarters in the steerage. The purser also
told us that if we had no money we coulu
not land in Honolulu, and, sure enough,
we could not. They allowed us ashore,
but only to put us in jail, and there we
remained until the Australia arrived, on
that vessel we were unbidden guests also,
but everybody was kind to us, and the
passage has been a very pleasant one. In
spite of the setback, my daughter and I
are going to try it again, and we'll land
this time. JUBt you wait and see."
A man named Joseph Sylva was
drowned from the Australia while the yes-
Bel was at Honolulu. The deceased and a
young woman named Isabella Perry had
been uptown' and on returning to the wa
ter front wanted to boar 3 the steamer
Helene, lying alongside the Australia, as
they were passing from one vessel to the
other the woman stumbled and fell over
board. In her fall she grabbed at Sylva
and pulled him overboard also. She was
rescued, but Sylva must have struck the
side of the steamer, as he sank and did
not come up again. The body was recov
ered the next day by the Australia's crew.
The gunboat Yorktown reached Hono
lulu on January 22. She is to join the Ben
nlngton at Guam, and then both vessels
will proceed to Manila.
During the voyage of the barkentlne
Archer from Honolulu to San Francisco
Henry Heltmann, one of the passengers,
became insane. He thought the captain
and crew were conspiring to kill him, and
for the past nine days he has refused
food. When taken ashore yesterday by
Sergeant Bunner and Officer Ferguson of
the Harbor Police he was in a very weak
condition. When searched at the City
Hall a gold watch and chain, two checks
on the Claus Spreckels bajik of Honolulu
for $9750, a check on the Bishop Bank of
Honolulu for 1150. a certificate of deposit
on the Bank of Hawaii for $25 and $212 in
cash was found on him. Heltmann is
well known here. He is a musician, and
formerly played in the Baldwin Theater.
From there he went to Hawaii and Joined
the Royal Hawaiian Band, but latterly

By July 1 all masters and mates of
Teasels over 70# tons burden must hold a
I nited States license. As there is not a
third of them in possession of the neces
sary document, the new law has, of
course, caused quite a flutter in maritime
circles. Captains who have sailed the seas
for years In command of vessels without
a license naturally want to know if thov
will have to pass an examination, and all
hand? want to know what the new rules
and regulations will be like. In answer to
a query on the subject, from Gardner &
Thornly. the Custom-house brokers. Su
pervising: Inspector General Dumont sends
the following reply:
Gentlemen: I am in receipt by reference of
your letter of the l?th Instant in reference to
the promulgation of the rules and require
ments to govern the license officers under the
new law relating to sailing vessels over 396
tons, and In reply would say that the Board
of Supervising Inspectors, now In session, have
under consideration the formulation of rules
and regulations governing the licensing of
masters and mates of sailing vessels, which
rules, when approved, will be published in a
circular, together with the laws to which the
rules apply.
NEWSPAPER THIEVES.
Stern Justice Meted Out to Frank
Cole, Who Was Caught in
the Act.
The practice of stealing 1 newspapers
from doorsteps after they have been de
livered by the carriers has become so
common of late that the proprietors are
determined to spare no expense to catch
and punish the thieves. Complaints are
constantly being received at newspaper
offices from subscribers all over the city,
but the thieves as a rule are too cunning
to be caught
A man or boy who would sfal a news
paper would st^al anything. It is one of
the most contemptible species of thieving
and nnlj- the meanest class of people
would indulge in it. It has a double effect
j as It injures both the subscriber and the
publisher.
Police Judges in the past have allowed
a feeling of sympathy to sway them in
most cases of newspaper thieves for the
sake of their families. Although some of
them have been lightly punished the ma
jority have been discharged with a repri
mand "not to do it again."
Yesterday Frank Cole, a boy 14 years of
age. was convicted by Judge Graham oÂ£
stealing newspapers from stores and oth.
er buildings in the neighborhood of Post
and Kearny streets. He was caught in
the act last Sunday morning by Police
man Colt.'n. who saw him take papers
from the White House, O'Connor, Mof
i fatt & Co. and Dr. A. E. Phelan. 139 Post
j street. The boy is an old offender and the
I Judge sent him to the Whittier Reform
I School, where he will remain for several
years. The strict example of Judge Gra
ham will be followed by other Judges in
all cases of newspaper thieves.

' . aÂ£s-Â»^ safeguard of woman's health is clearly proven by the

is onÂ» from Mrs. W. P. Vaxentete, 566 Ferry Aye., Camden, N. J.:
II Deab Mes. Pi am:â Before writing to you I felt very bad, had terrible
sick headaches, no appetite, gnawing pain in stomach, pain in my back and right
side; was tired and nervous, and so weak I could scarcely stand. I was not
able to do anything, had sharp pains all through my body. Before I had taken :
half a bottle of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, I found myself im-
proving. I continued its use until I had taken four bottles, and f eli so well
that I did not need to take any more. lam like a new person,* â  *

A COLD WAVE COMES TO
THE STATE AT LAS!
SEVERE WINDSTORM IS NOW
PREVALENT HERE.
Professor Hammon Says It Will Be
Accompanied by Little if
Any Rain.
The backbone of the warm spell -which
has been with us for two weeks was
broken yesterday morning' about 10 o'clock
and a cold wind storm set in, which has
occasioned much discomfort and may
mean not a little damage to the products ;
of this State. At that time the tempera
ture began to fall and a northwest wind
blew at a rapid rate, and has been stead- !
lly increasing since then.
It was below zero from the southern |
boundary of Kansas as far north as the
Weather Bureau had reports, and Pro
fessor Hammon said it was safe to say
that the cold wave extended to the north
pole. At Dodge City the thermometer i
registered 6 degrees below zero, Denver
2 below, Lander 10, Chicago 12, Helena
zero, Bismarck 20 and just north of Mon
tana 28 below caused things to freeze gen
erally. In this city it was 30 above and
getting colder.
It has been snowing throughout the
country east of the Rockies and appar
ently was getting ready to do so on this '
side. The windstorm which has accom- !
panied the cold weather Is getting more '
and more severe. The wind is from the
northwest and blowing at the rate of
fifty miles an hour at Point Reyes, sixty
four at Winnemucca, fifty-five at Mount
Tamalpni* ami thirty-six here. At Eureka i
It was thirty miles, and a few hundredths
of an Inch of rain fell at that place.
Professor Hammon said he could not
offer any particular reason for the change
in the weather. "An area, of low press
ure." he said, "moved into Washington
early Tuesday morning, but from where
I do not know. It is moving southeast,
and will gn to Utah, Nevada and New-
Mexico. The wind blowing toward that
area of low formed a sort of trough, and
brings the wind from the Northwest to
us. The storm will be accompanied by
little If any rain. There may be a slight
precipitation In Southern California, fol
lowed by a norther which will do more
harm than good. The warm weather wn
have been having has done no appreciable
harm, though if it should be followed by
frost In the next thirty-six hours grave
consequences will ensue to the buds of
apricots and almonds which have formed
and we will have but a small crop of those
products. The prunes have not started
much, and so will not suffer."
The barometer- has been falling near
here and rising everywhere else. The
storm is not considered dangerous to
shipping.

DEMOCRATS
REPUDIATE
THE EXAMINER
W.B.English's Scath
ing Denunciation.
YELLOW PAPER A TRAITOR
SAYS IT WANTS PARTY MONEY,
WHICH IS SCARCE.
Dr. E. H. Wooisey Elected Chairman
of the Oakland Convention and
the Committeemen
Named.
OAKLAND, Jan. 31.â When Chairman
Con Brosnahan called the Democratic
convention to order to-night he reviewed
what he called the slaughtering of the
party in this county since 1896. He re
ferred to the two attempts at fusion and
6ald that on each occasion the party had
been sold out to the Republicans. When
nominations for chairman were called for
Charles IfcCleverty wanted to know why
the chairman of the City Central Commit
tee did not call the convention to order.
Chairman Brosnahan said that the city
committee had empowered the. committee
of twenty-one to act and that everything
was right and proper.
Warren B. English then took the floor
and denounced the Examiner. "The Dem
ocratic party of this county," he said,
"has been discredited by the Examiner,
which paper has been supported by the
Democratic party, I might say, since time
immemorial. The Examiner has no cause
for the charge that it has made against
the Democracy of Oakland. It should
have waited till it saw the personnel of
The convention and of the ticket which
It will nominate. The Examiner carries
on a business to make money and it is
hard just now to get anything from the
Democracy, so the paper that could do a
great deal of good for the party it pro
fesses to serve is now doing a great deal
of harm. All we want is a square deal,
Â«nd I say it is an outrage to assail us. I
hope the' Examiner will be advised of the
facts surrounding this convention. I was
a warm personal friend of the late Sena
tor Hearst, a noble man and a Democrat,
who made the Examiner and who gave j
everybody a square deal. We ask for a i
square deal on this side of the bay and !
that is all. I nominate Dr. E. H. Wool- j
Bey for chairman of this convention."
The doctor was elected by acclamation.
On assuming charge of the convention.
Chairman Wooisey named the following i
committees:
Order of businessâ Dr. P. S. Coke. W. j
H. Lemon, James Singen, M. T. Holland, |
Walter Laymance, Ernest Abraham, D. j
S. Parker.
Credentialsâ E. Murphy. W. J. Smythe. i
R. Armstrong, H. E. Hopkins.. John M.
English, J. J. Landregan, S. K. Lemon.
Platform and resolutionsâ F. Leonhardt, i
A. Bruenn, Harold Martin. H. D. Senram.
W. B. English, Martin Ryan, B. F. Stet- j
pon.
The reports on credentials and order of
business were perfunctory affairs and
were quickly adopted.
The convention then elected the follow- ,
Ing City Central Committee:
First Wardâ J. C. Bullock, Fred Leon
hardt.
Second Wardâ J. P. Smyth, Leslie Mc-
Killican.
Third Wardâ J. F. Conners, W. B.
White.
Fourth Wardâ M. J. Holland, Pat Gal
lagher.
Fifth Wardâ J. W. Laymance, Con Bros
nahan.
Sixth Wardâ P. E. Dalton, Hiram Lut
trell.
Seventh Wardâ M. J. Laymance, J. W.
Baker.
As the committee on platform and reso
lotions wanted more time to report, the j
convention adjourned to Thursday night. |
MTAYDEN RELEASED
FOR THE THIRD TIME
JUDGE HALL DECIDES AN IM-
PORTANT POINT.
Klondiker Goes Free Because of No
Evidence That He Committed
Crime in Seattle.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 31.
D. A. McFayden. the Klondiker, who j
was arrested last Saturday on a telegram
from Seattle, was again released this af
ternoon on a writ of habeas corpus.
McFaydpn, according to the telegram,
is charged with "larceny by embezzling"
JI6SS belonging to Phil Hampton. Yester
day McFayden, by his attorney, T. F.
Garrity, sued out a writ of habeas corpus,
â¢which after a tedious hearing, was grant
ed by Judge Ellsworth on the ground
that there is no law authorizing a Jus
tice of the Peace in one State directing
the peace officers of another State to ar
rest any person. No sooner had McFay
den been released than Detectives Shorey
and Hodgkins rearrested him on a charge
of being a fugitive from justice, preferred
by Hodgkins.
Late last night McFayden was released
on a certified check for $1000 bail, fur
nished by W. W. Watson, Dr. F. J. Todd
and J. J. Carroll, and this morning Lin
Church, as attorney for McFayden, sued
out a second writ of habeas corpus be
fore Judge Hall, who in once more re
leasing the prisoner decided an important
point.
The telegram on which McFayden was
arrested stated that the latter was
charged before a Seattle Justice with the
crime of "larceny embezzlement," as did
also the affidavit of Detective Hodgkins.
Judge Hall decided, under citations of
fered by Attorney Church, that this is
not sufficient; that the prisoner cannot
be held even awaiting extradition papers,
unless there is some evidence that a crime
has been committed, and, moreover, the
crime must be actually charged. There
fore, since the affidavit declares that Mc-
Fayden i:; a fugitive from Justice and al
leges that he i.s charged with crime but
In reality does not charge him, he was re
leased.
It was stated from the District Attor
ney's office that no further effort will be
made to hold McFayden. The latter is a
resident of East Oakland, where he has
a wife and child. He returned recently
from Dawson City, where he owns one of
the largest saloons. He vigorously denies
Hampton's charge and swears that he
never knew his accuser to possess $1655.
Asks for Change of Venue.
OAKLAND, Jan. 31.â 1n the suit brought
last month by Lady Mary Lellah Yarde-
Buller, Ralph K. and Arthur K. Blair,
by their guardian ad lltem apainst Ernest
H Wakeman, for an accounting and re
moval of the latter as trustee of the
Yarde-Buller estate, defendant to-day
filed a demand and motion for a change
of venue. In an accompanying affidavit
Trustee Wakefield avers that he is not,
and was not at the time of the commence
ment of the suit, a resident of Alameda
rounty, and that he resides in San Fran
o'ifico where the suit should be held. His
attorneys, Dunne & McPike, also filed to
day a general demurrer to the complaint.

PRIESTESS IS
NOW FREE TO
MARRY AGAIN
Mrs. Yates Quietly
Divorced.
HER DENIAL A MYSTERY
OBTAINED A DECREE OVER A
MONTH AGO.
When the Lady Went East She Said
It Was to Be Reunited to Her
Husband, Who Was
Waiting for Her.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 31.
Mme. Ellse Montague-Yates is free to !
marry whomsoever she pleases. It was
discovered to-day that a decree of divorce
had been granted her, and that it was
filed a month ago, but so quietly was it
all done that the Oakland Psychic Society :
j was not aware that its high priestess was j
j an interesting divorcee.
The proceedings in this case have been
j mysterious throughout, and Mme. Mon
tague, who, it is now said, is in Europe,
could undoubtedly give an interesting ex- â 
planation of the whole matter.
When she left Oakland several weeks '<â 
ago there was a very affecting scene at j
j the Sixteenth-street depot, and the
< madame was assuring her friends that j
i there was no truth whatever in the story !
! that she was anxious to be divorced. She
: said with tears in her eyes that it was '
; all a cruel, horrid statement- and tbat she
loved her hubby and anticipated no .
I greater pleasure than Joining him in the
| East. The madame denied that she nad !
i given her sensational testimony, which !
was partly published, and in her sweet .
tones with her attractive French accent j
she authorized one of her intimate ac- ;
quaintances to publish a denial of the
whole story.
Since going East the madame's attor
neys have followed out her wishes, one of
her influential friends has exerted his in
fluence, and there now stands of record i
a judgment showing that on December
23 of last year Mme. Montague Yatea was
j released from the bonds of matrimony
i for the reason that her husband for four
i years has not contributed to her support, :
| has not exercised the privileges and rights
' of his position, ana has practically been
a deserter from his wife's home during
all of that time.
The great pressure brought to bear on
j Mme. Montague to get her divorce, even :
j against her own wishes, as she stated to j
I her friend.*, has invested the Incident with
] much public interest, as the celebrated l
| lecturess has a State reputation among
i psychologists. The granting of the di- I
v< rce is all the more peculiar because the '
j report waa so industriously circulated at
! the time of her departure that her bus
band was in a lucrative position with a ;
I Oaisndlan railroad, and that they were to
ibe reunited. All of these tales were false, ;
! and the story of the madame's romantic â 
life and attempt to secure a divorce, !
; which extended over tr.ree years and
which were published in full in The Call
last December, are absolutely verified by
the records.
Since the madame's departure the Oak
land Psychic Society has gone out of ex
] istence, and the only remnant of it now i
to be found is when a few of the members
gather together and gossip about their i
j late leader's varied and mysterious ex-
I periences in this city.

I fixed at $1000. Key was arrested a few
days ago at the racetrack on complaint
of John J. Wall, who accused him with
having stolen his pockctbook containing

The authorities across the bay haven theory that the relics were placed
where they were found by some medical student, who took that means to din
pose of his "subject," and having formed that theory are quite content to
accept it without further investigation. In support of this theory they refer
to the fragments of flesh adhering to the bones, which have the appearance
of being partly rooked, as thouph coming from the caldron of a medical col
lege. Besides, they say, the flesh sh >ws evidence of having been cut as
though with a scalpel.
But those who believe that the unknown hand points to a trag

cooked appearance of the flesh can readily be accounted for in other ways. â¢

Altvater Contestants Win.
OAKLAND. Jan. 31.â The contestants in
the estate of the late David Altvater have
Avon an important point. Judge Hall to
day denied the petition of the widow to
set apart the property on Benton street,
Alameda, for her use as a homestead.
Ills Honor, moreover, said that he con
sidered the appraisement on the property
too low, it being appraised at $1500. The
execution and motion to tax costs was
also set aside.
LOONEY WAS NOT BADLY
ENSNARED BY GRACE
PARTED WITH ONLY $5 OF GOOD
COIN.
Humorous Witness at the Trial of
Marriage Schemers Bain and
Allison.
The trial of the Allison-Bain combina
tion in the United States District Court
for using the mails with Intent to defraud
was resumed yesterday before Justice de
Haven. The monotony of the proceed
ings was relieved by W. E. Looney, an
other prospective victim of the matri
monial schemers. He made a voluble
and facetious witness, and gave his an
swers to the attorneys in a short, snappy
way, as If he regarded the matter as a
huge joke. He is entirely different from
J. L. Duprey, the aged victim, who acts
in a fur.ereal, matter of fact way during
his examination. Â«-'â¢Â«.
Dupriy was a little forgetful about the
ifierviews he had with his fair charmer.
Several more of his letters were produced
in evidence, and one in particular, where
he answered the questions on the printed
circular, was amusing. He filled in the
blanks to the effect that he was consid
ered handsome- by his friends, was
healthy, not much of a singer, but could
dance splendidly. Considering that Du
prey is a man of sixty years this caused
a ripple of laughter throughout the court
room. He thought Mrs. Allison had too
much moneyâ a little less would have suf
ficed. He had never made a personal ap
plication to get his presents back, but
his lawyers had done so. The piano was
returned to him, but the drapery cover
he had not as yet received.
In the afternoon Looney was placed on
the stand and did not mince words in his
replies. He testified to seeing the per
sonal in a Seattle paper in Skaguay re
garding Grace Allison, receiving a circu
lar in reply to his letter to Bain's matri
monial agency. In it the charms of the
fair Grace were minutely described. When
Looney came to this city in August last
he refused to treat with the agency, say
ing that he was competent to do his own
courting. After interviewing the lady he
informed Bain, who was known to him as
Curtis, that he must have stretched his
Imagination a little bit in describing her
beauty. Incidentally Looney parted with
$5 as a registratiqn fee in the matrimonial
concern, for which h^ received a receipt
produced in evidence. He asked Bain to
return the coin later, but this the latter
refused to do.
Looney said he was also in communica
tion with a New York agency in the same
line as. Bain's at that period, and had
also answered several personals of like
tenor to Mrs. Allison's. When he went to
see her in her apartments at 415 Jones
street. Bain desired to accompany him,
but Looney would not have it that way.
After he was ushered into the presence
of the lady, Looney said they had some
conversation, part of which was as fol
lows:
About the first Question she asked of
Looney was, "Are you a wealthy man?"
Looney replied that it did not matter,
since she had stated in her correspond
ON a banch in the rear room of Dep
uty Coroner Fowler's office in Ala
meda Is a pasteboard box containing
the human arm and shoulderblade
found In the recesses of a boxcar last Sat
urday night. All efforts on the part of the
authorities to unravel the mystery of
Brakeman Gentry's grisly discovery have
proved unavailing, and Mr. Fowler only
awaits an d^der from his superior to
finally dispose of the last evidence of â
possibly a hideous crime.
Careful inspection of the bones, and par
ticularly the fingers, indicates that they
are those of a woman; not a part of the
frame of a young, tenderly nurtured and
refined girl, but rather of a large, proba
bly hard-working woman, for the nails
which still cling to the shriveled parch
ment-like cuticle show few traces of man
icuring. It is quite possible, however,
that the bones are those of an under
sized man, but whose or whence they
came will probably never be revealed.
The car In which they were discovered
was loaded with coal at the Southern Pa
cific Company's mines In the Rocky Moun
tains and was switched direct to Ala
meda Point, where It was unloaded late
Saturday* afternoon. It was then swept
out thoroughly and switched over to the
transfer station. The bones could not have
been in the car then, but were undoubt
edly deposited there late that night.
There is only one person known in Ala
meda to whom the bones could possibly
have been a part. That is the Stanford
student, Adolph vjoetz, who so myste
riously disappeared one night last Novem
ber. Careful search of the Oakland rec
woman who could possibly have been dls-
ence that she had money enough for
both.
Then the slangy Grace said, "Well, I
wouldn't marry a man who was 'on the
I'Og.' "
After a little more talk, during wnlch,
the Allison woman became angry, she
flounced up and said, "I want you to
know that I am no red stocking." Looney
replied. "I don't care what color stock
ings you wear," and indulged in further
repartee which he gleefully related.
Looney denied the impeachment that he
was looking for a woman with money, al
though he had no particular objection to
her having a little. He also denied that
he had ever been in hiding to prevent
himself from being a witness in the case.
lax Collector Sheehan was put on tne
stand to testify as to Mrs. Allison being
on the assessment roll or not, but when
ho was interrogated on the point Attor
ney Crowley for the defendants inter
posed an objection, which was sustained
by the court, who held that the evidence
was framaterial.
The case will be resumed this morning
when F. Schenck, another gullible Indi
vidual, will go on the stand.

The revolution in the public schools of
this city has now become a controversy
that the courts of the State must decide.
Many of the teachers who were degraded
In rank or who were dismissed from the
depnrtment on Monday night, have de
termined to raise a legal Issue and test
the assumed authority of the Board of
Education to disturb the status of teach
ers In the department. The entire ques
tion is at the same time interesting and
Involved. In the first place the tabulated
statement of transfers, changes, degrada
tions in rank and dismissals Is not cor
rect.
The chief deputy of the Superintendent
of Schools admits this fact and accounts
for it on the score of inadvertance. The
ilst of changes, submitted on Monday
night by the Superintendent of Schools,
Is not chronologically correct. The names
of several teachers who should have been
dismissed under the ruling of the Board
of Education have not been mentioned In
any connection. In some way these
teachers, who should have followed
In the path of their less fortunate sisters,
werr- overlooked and protected in the
scheme ,of elimination. Superintendent I
Webster, through his deputy, emphatical
ly denies that political influence had any
thing to do with the protection granted,
but the fact remains that certain teach
ers who should have been dismissed were
untouched by the pruning knife of re
trenchment.
Superintendent Webster was as inac
cessible yesterday as the unknown god of
the Greeks, but Mr. Webster's assistant
volunteered the information that an
amended list of dismissed teachers would
be produced as soon as it could be pre
pared. The Board of Education had prom
ised that teachers would be treated im
partially, but the Superintendent inad
vertently had overlooked several young i
ladies whose names will now be added to j
those dismissed from the department.
When these names have been added to
the Superintendent's list another Inexpli
cable fact will remain in connection with
the report of the Superintendent. It will
be remembered that the Board of Educa- |
tlon unanimously decided to dismiss all |
teachers that were appointed to the de
partment on and after August 15, 1898.
In the report submitted by Superintend
ent Webster there is a list of unassigned
day teachers who are nominally in the
department and serving without pay for
their services. In this list are the names
Di several young ladies who were appoint
ed to the department on August 10, 1898.
Under the order of the Board of Educa
tion these young ladles should have been
dismissed. Why they were not discharged
Is a question that has not yet been satis
factorily answered.
Superintendent Webster is now busily
engaged in preparing for each Interested
teacher the official notice of her transfer,
degradation in rank or dismissal from the
department. Mr. Webster attempted yes
terday to expedite matters by giving a
few teachers special letters to principals
authorizing transfers. These personal let
ters, as a matter of course, were not rec
ognized in lieu of an official notification.
The official list, with the modifications
made necessary by the Superintendent's
oversight, will It is expected, be ready
to-day. The department will then con
tinue its course under the scheme of re
organization. The official notification to
interested teachers will be the signal for
legal controversy.
Many of the teachers that have been
dismissed or have been degraded in rank
have consulted attorneys and have been
advised to resist the action of the Board
of Education. This resistance will simply
be formal and will be no more than suf
ficient to constitute a legal protest. Each
teacher has been instructed to refuse to
give up her roll book until forced to do
so by the principal of her school. This
action, it is anticipated, will protect the
legal rights of the teacher. When teachers
are asked this morning to give up their
positions they will voice this formal pro
test so as to have, if possible, a technical
advantage in the litigation that will fol
low.
While individual teachers are condemn
ing the action of the board, the general
community is praising the action of the
Directors in attempting to inaugurate an
economical administration of the schools.
The board has promised that impartial
Justice will be shown to all teachers.
Superintendent Webster has admitted
that he made several mistakes, which will
be corrected. There remains, therefore,
no doubt that the scheme of economy will
be carried out independent of political in
fiuenceÃ.
The suits that are to be instituted by
interested teachers will be based upon
the Kennedy decision. A meeting of dis
missed teachers will probably be held to
day, when legal advice will be secured.
One of the supreme tests that will be
made will be in reference to the last three
meetings of the last Board of Education.
If these meetings were legal nearly all of
the work of the present board will have
to be undone. If the last board had the
legal right to act as it did on the last
day of December, the present board has
no authority in law to undo what Its pre
decessor accomplished. This will be the
critical question of the controversy
Residents of the Mission are not yet
reconciled to the action of the board in
sending the commercial departments of
the Mission High School to the Polytech
nic High School. While the efforts of Di
rector E. L. Head to secure a reconsider
ation of the matter were in vain, the Mis
sionites intend to agitate the affair still
further. The board has, however, defi
nitely settled the question and will hear
no further appeals.
That the School Directors are true to
the faith within them is becoming evi
dent more and more. It was expected
that protests from the dismissed and the
unassigned would Immediately flow in
and the expected has happened. As one
Director expressed it: "If we were to un
cover a local Klondike, mint the nuggets
and- pay off the school fund deficit some
body would rise up with a much-signed
protest."
The fear of these objections seems, how
ever, to roll off the board like water from
a duck s back, to express it in an Irish at
ticism. The board meets a protestation
with another abolition. Whatever its sins
it has to its credit the merit, of sticking
together and to its text. The Normal
School was abolished, and a" petition rep
resenting a million dollars' worth of prop
erty objected. Four evening schools, a big
commercial school and several cooking
schools that got caught in the "suction^
went down. The passing of the commer
cial concern raised a four-thousand-name
protest, and the School Department teach
ers and employes lost 20 per cent of their
January pay. Said a wise young lady
teacher yesterday: "Save us from our
friends! One more protest and there won't
be a school left in the city."
Naturally the withholding of a por
tion of January money is 20 per cent of
income clipped from the school teachers
who have been browsing on short grass for
three months, and they would protest
but they well try to make the R0 per cent
go as far as possible, hoping that the day
of abolition has likewise been abolished.
The sixty-eight or seventy thousand
dollars will go some distance toward
settling the rent, board and grocery bills
if some stray injunction doesn't come
along before pay day. The board in
tended to settle the January claims im
mediately, but the work of extracting
that holdover 20 per cent from the ac
count has delayed pay time till Feb
ruary 8. *
A few lawyers who are ever pawing
and sniffing for litigation afar off are
arguing the illegality of holding back a
part of an -employe's salary, on "statu
tory grounds."
The Mission people, though beaten, are
not cast down, and a mass meeting in the
near future, to which the whole "warm
belt" is to gather, will publicly object
to the closing of the High School com
mercial classes. Dr. Clinton, ex-Super
visor, one of the leaders of the fight for
the despised department, Is bitter over
the treatment accorded to the Mission
petition by the board last Monday even
ing.
"These signatures represented our whole
populous district," said Dr. Clinton yes
terday; "but no attention was paid to
them. While we were waiting for an op
portunity to save our school the ax was
swinging and other things were going
down. We received no notice nor cour
tesy. We were not even 'bowed out.' Our
fine building was emptied of its great
commercial class and the pupils told to
go across the city to another school."
The disaster caused by the abolition of
the high school commercial class is not
quite Incurable. A delegation of pupils
from that school yesterday visited Prin
cipal Bush of the Polytechnic, who in
formed them that if thirty or more would
enter that school he could find room for
eighty-five and possibly the whole number
(103). They could continue their old Mis
sion High School course of Instruction
and be graduated In June. This was en
tirely satisfactory, and the class will en
ter the Polytechnic.
Principal Bush stated in an Interview
that the commercial course of study of
the two schools was not materially dif
ferent from each other. The Pitman
system of stenography was taught at the
Mission, while the eclectic method was
a part of the Polytechnic course. The
pupils will be permitted to go on with
their Pitman shorthand In their new
school. In the Polytechnic business Unit
ed States history and several English
branches of study are taught, and this is
the only difference between the courses
of the two institutions. It costs $90 per
year to graduate a pupil in the Mission
High and $45 in the Polytechnic. The
change from one school to the other will
do away with the services of four or five
teachers.
Relative to the proposed repairs on
school buildings, mentioned in the report
of the committee on building made Mon
day evening, Chairman Holbrook stated
yesterday that not a single nail will be
driven, not a single foot of lumber will
be used and not a pint of paint will be
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1899.
spread in repairs or in construction of
houses unless absolutely necessary.
"I shall ask the chairman of the build
ing committee," said Director Holbrook,
"for the very lowest figure he must have.
If a building is falling down, or if the
health of the children is threatened, we
will fix up a little, and that is all. It is
hard to hold back 20 per cent from the
teachers' January salary, but we must
have a small fund left over for emer
gencies. We will try to pay in full next
month. We expect protests and criti
cism, but that will not deter the board
in its policy of retrenchment. The Call
Bald we were 'standing pat on our propo
sition.' Possibly that best expresses it.
We are a unit in our desire to get this
almost ruined school department on solid
ground again."
The arrangement for paying the Nor
mal School bills for the remaining four
months of the present term will not be
much of a change from the old system.
The pupils will pay into the City School
Department the first of every month
money which will be paid out In salaries
and other running expenses of the school.
l,ess than $5 per month from each of the
125 students will be ample for all needs.
There are a number of pupils in the in
stitution who are financially unable to
pay their pro rata, but their part will be
made up by the others. Miss Fowler, the
principal, will contribute $25 per month
to the fund and others equally generous
will do the same.
The Taxpayers' Educational League has
framed several amendments to the San
Francisco State Normal School bill, now
pending In the Legislature, asking for an
appropriation of $150,000. The principal
amendment asks that a sultabFe building
be procured immediately for occupancy
as several years would undoubtedly elapse
before the buildings were completed.
In the matter of the new school houses
asked for by the Building Committee on
Monday evening no action will be taken,
until June, when the Board of Supervis-
Unique Reveoge ot Two FJat Factory Apprentices.
ors will be asked to grant an appropria
tion.
Out of all this change In the School
Department have come tales of heroism
and self-sacrifice tinged invariably with
pathos. There are stories of young wo
men who are the sole support of aged
parents and of other relatives dependent
upon them for the necessities of life.
There are stories of homes that are in
danger of being lost because payments
of interest have not been made as origin
ally provided for, and of hundreds of de
mands on slender purses.
In the report presented by Superintend
ent Webster on Monday night appeared
a simple paragraph: *
"Miss Elizabeth M. McDonald. May 13,
1896. resigned her rl^ht and took the place
of Mrs. Egan, transferred from evening to
day school December 31, 1897."
fiack of this is a story which contains
all the elements that bring out in strong
relief the self-sacrifice and thoughtful
ness of a woman. Miss Elizabeth Mc-
McDonald is the daughter of John W.
McDonald, president of the City Street
Improvement Company. Miss McDonald
has been employed In Noe Valley School.
Mrs. Egan also had a class there, and
when it was learned that some teacher
must be consolidated out it was found
that Mrs. Egan was that one. This cre
ated much sympathy for her, as she is a
widow with a large family dependent
upon her. She grew despondent over her
threatened dismissal.
Miss McDonald came to the rescue wnen
matters looked the darkest. She did not
need the salary of her position as badly
as he* associate, and she resolved upon a
self-sacrifice. She determined to give her
place to the widow. Her action has
brought her commendation from asso
ciates and those informed of her sacrifice.

CULPRITS LEAVE A NOTE
J. GRACE AND W. PYNE
OF THEIB ACT.
Pay a Midnight Visit to the Shop of
Their Former Employers and
Destroy $2500 Worth
of Goods.
Joseph Grace, aged 19. and Willie W.
Pyne, aged 15, have declared themselves
outlaws and socialists, but within the
next forty-eight hours they will probably
be behind prison bars and the romance of
being hunted criminals will be oozing
from their finger tips while they are
awaiting trial on the charge of malicious
ly destroying property to the value of
$2500. - : â¢.'/'"'...-. '-. ,
â¢Some time Monday night the two boys
entered the hat ; and cap factory of : M.
Marsh & Co., at 411 Market street, where
they had been ~ employed, and nearly
wrecked . the establishment. . The /object
was for revenge for Jal fancied grievance
and the damage 'done' is irreparable and
will, seriously cripple j the business of the
firm for some time to come, as the youth
ful criminals not only "destroyed the goods
they had helped to make, but the tools
as well. ' â  . â  - .'â  '.
When they had completed their work to
their satisfaction the factory looked as
though it had been struck by a cyclone.
The firm Of Marsh & Co. occupies the
entire fifth floor of the building and the
place was "jam full" of goods in all
stages of manufacture from the raw ma
terial to the finished article. When the
factory was locked up for the night on
Monday evening the long benches and
shelves were piled high with hats and
caps finished and all ready for delivery.
Bolts of cloth and silk used for lining the
headgear were ranged the entire length
of the place in symmetrical rows, while
hundreds of models and costly patterns
were carefully put away In lockers and
closets to preserve them from harm un
til they should be again needed.
When Mr. Marsh arrived at his place of
business at 7 o'clock yesterday morning
the scene that met his gaze nearly par
alyzed him with astonishment and con
sternation. Everything was in the utmost
confusion; the bolts of silk and cloth were
overturned on the floor, slashed and torn;
a great heap of visors, torn or cut from
finished caps, occupied a commanding po
sition in the center of the floor, while the
caps which they had adorned were scat
tered all over the place; the models were
chipped so as to utterly destroy their use
fulness, and the patterns, over two hun
dred in number, were completely de
stroyed. The miscreants had done their
work thoroughly and were evidently
proud of the ruin they had wrought, for
pinned to the office door was the follow
ing note addressed to one of the work
men:
Dear Friend Shine: I have to say good-hy
to you, but hope to see you again. 1 did this,
not because I wanted to, but compelled to.
I did not steal anything, everything is here.
I always had an Idea to do good and thought
some day to be a blessing to my father and
mother and hope to do It yet. Good-by.
JOE GRACE,
W. W. PYNE.
Dear Friend Jake and the rest of the shop
mates: Please do me a favor by going up to
Levlson Brothers, 134 Sutter street, where my
father works. Tell him not to worry over me,
as I did nut steal anything from the shop.
You know that the four and a half years I
have worked for Majrsh I did my work fair
and square and tried to be good friends with
every one, but when I seen what a dirty trick
he played on David and me I lost confidence In
myself and did this deed for justice and for
rights. I may get in trouble over this, but I
will try and make the best of It. My mother
and sisters are the best folks to feel bad over
this. Sorry, but could not help It. Tell you
this as a friend. Goldman said he Is a social
ist. You know the rest, he Is.
(Unsigned.)
As soon as he recovered the use of his
faculties Mr. Marsh notified the police
and Detectives Ed Gibson and w. J.
Wrenn were detailed on the case. Grace
made his home with his father, Max
Grace, at 33 Bright street. Ocean View
while Pyne lives on Majestic avenue
Ocean View, with his father, yrho is a
laborer. The boys came home from work
Monday night and announced that they
had quit work and had turned socialist*.
They then departed for town, saying they
were going to a sword duel. They did not
return home that night and have not been
seen or heard from since.
Both Mr.. Marsh and his partner, A.
Goldman, say they are at a loss to under
stand the cause of the outrage. Grace
had been in their employ for nearly five
years and the Pyne boy for several
months. The former received $9 and the
latter $8 per week ani there had never
been any trouble about pay. A few weeks
ago a younger brother of the Grace boy,
who was also employed in the factory,
was laid off because of slack business,
and this seems to have been the indirect
cause of the trouble. Monday evening
Joseph Grace informed Mr. Marsh that
he would work no longer and demanded
his wages. He was paid, and was then
requested to hand over the set of dupli
cate keys to the factory which he car
ried.
"They are at the bottom of the bay and
If you want them you can dive for them."
he replied, and with that the two promis
ing youngsters departed to perfect their
plans for revenge.
"I cannot understand it," said Mr. Gold
man yesterday afternoon, as he sadly
surveyed the wreckage. "Grace had been
with us so long that I had the utmost
confidence in him. His brother was not
discharged, but simply laid off until busi
ness should pick up a little." Detective
Gibson suggested that the boys might
Bet fire to the place.
"That's it. that's it," said Mr. Marsh ex
citedly, "they would not set fire to the
place because they did not want me to get
anything. If I had be*n burned out I
would have had some insurance, but as it
is my Insurance does not protect me."
Max Grace, the father, and the younger
boy David were at the factory during the
day and appeared to be greatly affected
by the disgrace brought upon them by
the son and brother. Out in Ocean View
both boys have long been regarded as in
corrigibles. _^___________ _

THE CHARGE AGAINST MOORE.
Arthur P. Rhodes Found Miss Crit
tenden, the Major's Type
writer, In Tears.
Ex-Customs Collector John H. Wise ap
peared before Special Agents Smith and
Llnck yesterday morning for the purpose
of giving them some information as to
the whereabouts of certain witnesses in
the matter of charges made by Wise
against Special Agent Moore. The agents
inquired tor Mrs. Sallie C. Pfckens, for
merly typewriter for the major, but they
were informed that she was in Oakland
visiting her twin sons. She will be sum
moned, to appear before the agents to
morrow.
The only witness examined yesterday
was Arthur P. Rhodes, a weigher in the
Customs Department. Mr. Rhodes' story
was old â about three years. One day he
went into Major Moore's office and found
his typewriter, Miss Crittenden, in tears.
He asked her what was the matter and
she said that the major had Insulted her
by making a dishonorable proposal. Mr.
Rhodes reported the complaint to Col
lector Wise and Mr. Wise removed Miss
Crittenden to another department, where
the major could not pursue her. Miss
Crittenden is believed to be In Paris, far
enough away from the major to be safe.

Creegan should be set at liberty in return
for trie services he rendered in deserting
Becker, thereby forcing the wnman of
the gang to enter a plea of guilty. It is
asserted by the officers of the Pinkerton

have been, in favor of releasing Creegan,
as they consider him as dangerous to the
banking fraternity as Becker. They de
sire his conviction and will vigorously
prosecute him with that end in view.
