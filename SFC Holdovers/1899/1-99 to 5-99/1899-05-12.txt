Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May Syria was
proclaimed a free and independ
ent state to-day by a revolution
ary party, which for three years
has been secretly at work
throughout the world.
Copies of a call to arms â re issued
by the thousand from headquarters of j
the secret council, or junta, of this city, j
This revolutionary party has on its j
rolls 25,0' Vi men in this country alone.
who are willing to ficht to free Syria
from the rule of the Sultan of Turkey, j
"Young Syria." as the society is
called, is the result of gradual growth.
The success of the Cubans has inspired
It to take a bold stand. Members say
there will be a very "sick man" in
Europe before lone, for they assert
they will have funds to equip armies
and vessels of war.
The coast lines of Syria, with its
oovÂ» and inlets and neighboring isles,
have been carefully studied â¢' â a
strategic point of view. The revolu
tionists, they say. have leaders with
naval and military training.
A cents of the junta, directed from
headquarters in this city, are active in
cities' of Syria, in London and in Paris.
Thousands in th* mountainous dis
tricts of Syria are counted upon to
flock to the standard of the liberators.
Al! of the thirty members of the junta
herp had a hand in the preparation of
the call to arms issued to-day. The
proclamation is simply signed "Young
Syria.' - Toward the end of the docu
ment stress is laid upon the assertion
that the revolutionary society known
as "Young Turkey" may lend its co
operation.
When asfceq 'j a similar society ex
isted in Armenia, the president smiled
and asked to be excused from talking
â upon the matter. He frankly said,
however, that in the event of Syrian
uprisings, the Sultan would be so busy
attending to "Young Turkey" that he
would not have time to give much at
tention to "Young Syria." . v
Upon the conditon that his name was
not to be used, and that no description
of his personal appearance be printed,
the president of the junta consented to
give an interview day.
"I am convinced.' said he. "that the
United States is the birthplace of re
publics. Since your country has
brought liberty to Cuba and the Philip
pines I believe that upon American soil
we may form plans for the emancipa
tion of Syria. The conditions of Syria
are terrible. The people are taxed be
yond all reason. Property is subject to
confiscation, and the home is not sa
cred.
"This document is -it a forerunner,
I may say. as others will follow which
phall outline our policy more clearly. I
may say ours will not be a talking
crusad", but one nf actual warfare. We
Fhall have men. ships and money, too.
"Of the hundred thousand and more
Syrians in America, of the many hun
dreds of thousands throughout the
world, as well as millions in our own
land, we shall choose the readiest to
our cause, and the first combined
stroke will be to a finish. And when
the blow falls 'Young Turkey,' which
is as powerfully organized as we, will
give the Sultan's government all it can
attend to at home, while we shall found
on Syrian soil its first great republic,
to be perpetuated there forever."

ADMIRAL DEWEY
WILL SOON SAIL
VIA SUEZ CANAL
NEW YORK. May 11.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Secretary Long cabled to Ad
miral Dewey to-day authorizing - him
to come home whenever he deemed it
wise to do so. and to return by such
route as he desired. This means that
Admiral Dewey will take the Suez
canal route, and will arrive at New
York about July 15. on board his flag
ship, the Olympia.
The confidence of the officials that
the admiral will not cross the Pacific,
but will come to New York, is based on
dispatches which have been received
from him. In fact, the authority sent
to Admiral Dewey- to start on his re
turn voyage in his discretion is based
on advices received from him to-day by
Secretary Long. These advices are pri
vate, but the Secretary acted promptly
upon them, and It is apparent from the
cablegram sent to the admiral that the
situation admits of his departure at
this time. ' â¢ â -/'â  .
It was said by an official with whom
1 talked this afternoon that it was his
expectation that the admiral will start
for home in a very few days. Though
ordered home Admiral Dewey will re
main a member of the Philippine Com
mission until its dissolution and will
act in an advisory capacity to the
President upon his arrival.

two enlisted men of the American navy
were killed.
Rear Admiral Kautz has also for
warded to the department copies of all
proclamations he ! has issued, which
have been transmitted to the date De
partment for its satisfaction.
There is reason to believe that
Kautz places the entire responsibility
for the trouble upon the German Con
sul, aided and abetted by certain Ger
mans residing in Samoa.
The high commission will under its j
instructions make an investigation of j
Kautz's conduct, as well as others tak

The Strike at Buffalo Rapidly Assum- I
ing a More Serious Aspect.
BUFFALO. N. V., May 11.â The strike !
among the members of the Freight
handlers' Union at this port is gradually |
assuming a serious aspect. There are
about 2000 of these men pledged not to I
work for any contractor, and many of
these men are now on strike. Originally i
a few of them went out in sympathy with I
the graln-shovelers, and to-night it is be- j
lieved that in case the scoopers gain their
point they will remain out until their dif
ferences have been satisfied.
Several managers of transportation
lines said to-day that if the contractors
did not speedily demonstrate their ability
to do the work of loading and unloading
freight-boats they would be compelled to
devise other means of relieving the con
gestion of traffic at the port.
At the Lehigh Valley docks the com
\ pany called in a lot of yard men and
other employes to take the lace of the
strikers, At the Central. Erie and other
big docks the work was practically at
a standstill, the few freight-handlers
who were at work being non-union men.
The freight-handlers demand an in
crease of wages from 2". cents an
hour, the present rate, to 30 cents an
hour for work outside of the freight
houses, and 20 cents an hour for inside
work. They also ask for the abolition of :
the contract system.

BISHOP POTTER MAY
ORDAIN DR. BRIGGS
Uncertainty Deepens as the Day Set
Apart for the Ceremony Ap
proaches.
NEW YORK. May 11. â Uncertainty
deepens as the day approaches which was
originally set for the ordination of Dr.
Briggs. Opponents of the clergyman have
been firm in the belief that his ordination
will he indefinitely postponed. To-day,
however, there were developed indications
which Dr. Briggs' friends said appeared
to point to a determination on the part
of Bishop Potter to proceed with the cere
mony. Rev. Dr. Huntington of Grace
Church hinted that he had information
regarding the intentions of Bishop Potter,
but was not at liberty to make them pub
lic. In an editorial the Churchman. Bish
op Potter's official mouthpiece, to-day
says: â¢ ; .:'-' i â¢â â¢ '-...?-
The church cannot be expected to pledge her
self to acquisitions of all kinds of, scientific in
vestigation. Scientific Bible study, is really an
evidence of growth of religious feeling, not of
Its decline. Archaeologists and critics are do
ing heroic work in making, the Bible sources
and Bible contents more intelligible every day.
Machinery, and administration of church life of
our day should not be used to hamper progress
of research and carry us off from the pathway
of truth to the byways of obscuration and
prejudice.' ---â¢_--â

CRIMES FIGURE
IN THF SMITH
DIVORCE CASE
-NEW YORK, May ILâ lncidental to
an action for divorce brought by-
Charles G. Smith, manufacturer of
lamps, against his wife, Dora H. Smith,
in which charges of misconduct are
made by each against the other, appear
many sensational features, such as at
tempted murder and suicide, threats to
kill and several love epistles. *
The features of the case became pub
lic to-day when the wife made an ap
plication for her support and mainte
nance, and for the appointment of a
commission to go to Los Angeles, Cal.,
to take evidence there. The motions
were submitted to Judge Scott in the
Supreme Court, the decision being re
served.
The marriage of the Smiths took
place in Boston in 1885. They have two
children twinsâ who are invalids. A
separation occurred several years ago
because they could not agree, and
Smith- stipulated to pay his wife $60
monthly. She has been keeping a
boarding-house since her husband left
her. He says she has been intimate
with William H. Short and Arthur
Waldo Lewis, but Mrs. Smith declares
that these charges are unfounded arid
nothing but the outcome of a con
spiracy against her. and that the char
acter of these men is such that, the
charges should not be believed.
Mrs. Smith tells an interesting nar
rative through her counsel of the man
ner in which she discovered her hus
band's relations with Mrs. Bessie Stan
ley of Los Angeles. Her story is based
in part from facts that she obtained
from her husband's diary, which was
sent to her fiom the Chief of Police of
Los Angeles, and from clippings from
newspapers of that city of April 2*l and
27. 1895. These reports show that
Charles H. Stanley shot his wife Bes
sie and immediately afterward com
mitted suicide as she had threatened to
leave him. They also stated that
Charles G. Smith, whom Mrs. Smith
says is her husband, had induced Mrs.
Stanley to leave her husband, and had
made many extensive and extravagant
presents to her.
At the time Stanley committed sui
cide Mrs. Smith says Smith left Los
Angeles so hurriedly that he left behind
his baggage and some personal effects,
including his diary, and pocketbook.
These were taken care of by the police
Smith made good his escape and his
effects, at her request, were sent on to
her. She charges that her husband
came East with a woman whom she
believes to be Mrs. Stanley, and that
they lived for some time in Brooklyn.
When she accused him of being one of
the persons concerned in the Los An
geles affair she says he admitted that
he was. but told her that he was not
aware that the woman was married.
Counsel for Smith introduced an affi
davit denying that he had been guilty
of improper conduct with Mrs. Stanley,
or that he had given her money and
presents.

The church in Santa Rosa was organ
ized in 1852. Its present edifice in this
city has become famed the world over
from the fact that every stick of lum
ber, including even "he -"tir-les used
in its construction, was cut from one
tree. So large was this giant of the
forest that the lumber from its body
not only r ---ucted the entire church
building, which is a large one, but
when the work was completed there re
mained on hand more than 1200 feet of
lumber that had not bee used. Of the
charter members of the Santa Rosa de
nomination Robert Crane of this city
is the only one now living.
HEAVY LOSS
BY FIRE AT
SAN PEDRO
SAN PEDRO. May 11.â The most ex
tensive fire that San Pedro has experi
enced in years occurred here early this
morning. A half-square of buildings
was laid waste and two or more per
sons narrowly escaped with their lives.
The burned district lies west of Beacon
street and north of Sixth street. It
extends from the corner of those two
thoroughfares, but floes not cross either.
The conflagration started at about 2
o'clock this morning. How it began
does not appear to be definitely known,
but according to several accounts there
was an explosion, which probably oc
curred on the lower floor of the Herald
building, which stood on Sixth street, a
short distance from Beacon. As soon
as the persons who heard the explosion
could reach the place it was all aflame
and beyond saving. There was a high
wind from the northeast, which aided
in the spread of the flames.
The Fire Department, a volunteer or
ganization, turned out and fought the
fire, but the water supply was soon re
duced to an alarmingly low pressure,
an-' it was apparent that the district
was doomed. The flames communicated
to the two-story Crocker building on
Sixth street and the Crocker building
on Beacon street. The two-story build
ing owned by Benjamin Weston went
next. Two- small residences were con
sumed.
The losses are estimated at $16,000,
with about $8000 insurance. The two
story building owned by James Herald
was insured for $2750. The ground floor
of the building was occupied by M.
Mayer's saloon. He carried no insur
ance. The upper floor was occupied by
Its. Sylvester and J. S. G. Waltney.
Their loss is $1000; Insurance $400. Dr.
Wilson, on the same Boor, lost $500; in
surance, $400. Another two-story
building owned by Mr. Herald was
occupied by J. M. Brysen as a saloon.
He carried $1000 and saved nothing.
Herald's one-story building was occu
pied by Putney's hardware shop. Part
of the stock was saved. The loss on
H. A. Crocker's two-story building is
$5000: insurance, $1950. It was occupied
by Proch's restaurant. His loss is $710;
no insurance. Real & Jones, grocers,
lost $1200; insurance, $600. Ben Weston's
building was valued at $1000; no insur
ance. It was occupied by Hixson's
hardware store. His loss was $1500; in
surance, $1000. ' '____

NEW YORK, May 11.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: I learned
that General Otis has practical
ly completed preparations for a
movement, which if successful will be
the master stroke of the campaign
against the insurgents.
Reinforcements have been sent to
General Mac Arthur, who is disposing
his troops, and General Lawton has
moved his column from Ballinag and
Maasin to a strategic position. Th
whole purpose of these movements is
to surround the 10.000 insurgents . be
lieved to be intrenched at Bacolor,
crush the organized forces and make
prisoners of all who are not killed in
battle.
Bacolor is southwest of San Fernan
do, where General Mac Arthur's head
quarters are established, and is cm the
line of the railroad. It is connected
with San Fernando by a wagon road.
Ma. -Arthur is expected to send a col
umn to the west of Bacolor. retaining
his main position on the north, and
General Law ton is believed to have
moved his column so as to protect
communication with Manila and at the
same time flank the insurgents at Ba
color on the east.
General Luna's command, which wai
last reported at Mexico, can be taken
care of, it is thought, by a few troops
making a demonstration in their front.
It is because of the necessity of hav
ing a strong force for this present
movement that General Otis has not
withdrawn the volunteers from Mac-
Arthur's and Lawton's command pre
paratory to shipping them home.
As a result of the arrival of the
Twenty-first Infantry and Light Bat
tery E of the First Artillery, thirty
nine officers and 1451 enlisted men in
all, it has been possible for General
Otis to send reinforcements to General
Mac Arthur, and at the same time
maintain a sufficiently strong force at
Manila to prevent the insurgents to the
southward from trying to carry it by
assault.
An encouraging feature of the pres
ent movement is the fact that to the
southward the. inhabitants are friendly
to Americans, and on the Rio Grande
there are a number of army gun
boats, which will be useful in main
taining communication and at the same
time attacking any insurgent bodies
that may come within range of their
guns.
"It is because of the preparations for
the proposed movement," said a prom
inent official with whom I talked to
day, "that we have had little news
from General Otis. President Schur
man has not cabled the State Depart
ment since his message of last Friday,
but we suppose that he and his col
leagues have held further conferences
with Aguinaldo's emissaries regarding
the government which will be given to
the Filipinos. With the insurgent army
at Bacolor destroyed and its members
captured. Aguinaldo and his subordi
nates will no doubt be more eager to
obtain the concessions the United
States is willing to give them than they
now appear to be." â¢

NO MORE TROOPS TO
GO VIA SUEZ CANAL
WASHINGTON, May 11. The War De

to Manila by way of New York and the '<
Suez anal. All troops now under orders |
for Manila or to *be ordered there during I
the next few months will be sent by way ,
of San Francisco. it is expected that j
the Grant and Sherman, now at San |
Francisco, and the Sheridan, which will I
soon arrive there, will carry all the '
troops that will be needed In the Phil- j
ippinep. Nor is it the intention at pres- |
ent to make the Logan, Meade and the j
Thomas a pan of the Pacific transport |
fleet. These ships will be refitted as j
soon as they can be spared from service '
In the West Indies. They are owned by
the Government, and with others will be
converted into the best army transports, â 
in accordance with plans announced long
ago, when it became apparent that army
transports wotiid lie needed for several
years to come. It is believed by the
quartermaster's department that nearly
four months will be required to put the
ships in first-class condition.
Secretary Alger says It will be quite |
three months before the ships are read;. i
for service, and he does not Intend to I
make any order now respecting their
movements at that time, but added that i
no troops would be either sent or re
turned to the United States by way of the
Sue?. canal at present. The health of the
troops would be endangered by going i
through the Indian Ocean and along the ;
equatorial latitudes during the summer. |
HARRISON GRAY OTIS
PRAISES VALOR OF TROOPS
WASHINGTON, May 11. _. Adjutant
General Corbin to-day made public the
report of General Harrison Gray Otis,
commanding the First Brigade, Second
Division, Eighth Army Corps, giving the
details of operations in the Philippines
from the Ist to the 33 st of March. The
brigade participated In the movement
againsl Malolos, which occupied several
days of fighting. In concluding the re
port General Otis says:
Thus, alter arduous and brilliant campaign
by the Second Division, supported by other
troops, lasting seven days and Involving fre
quent combats, numerous casualties among
our troops and heavy losses by the enemy,
Malolos, the recent capital of the so-called
Filipino "revolutionary" government, fell be
fore the American arms.
It is my grateful duty to commend the of
ficers and men for their bearing throughout
the campaign. They have shown in an emi
nent degree the qualities of good soldiers â
obedience, discipline, endurance, courage,
steadiness, patriotism and the most magnifi
cent ardor in battle. The regimental com
mandersâColonel Harry C. Kessler, First Mon
tana Infantry; Colonel Frederick Funston,
Twentieth Kansas Infantry, and Major W. A.
Knobbe, commanding the two battalions of
the Third United States Artillery (serving as
Infantry)â have again proved In actual field
service their capacity and fitness for their re
sponsible posts, and their skill and gallantry
under fire. I again recommend them and each
of them for such special mark of distinction
as the commanding general and the War De
partment may be pleased to confer upon them
"on their merits."
It is my grievous task to have to report that
the casualties of the brigade during the seven
days of operations, particularly described in
this report, aggregate 136 in killed and wound
ed, thus swelling the brigade's total casualties
in battle since the outbreak of the rebellion
to 285, or considerably more than 10 per cent
of the average strength of the command ac
tually engaged In the campaign from first to
last.

RECKLESS BRAVERY
OF AMERICAN TROOPS
CHICAGO. May 11.â Captain Frank F.
Eastman of the Fourteenth United States
Infantry arrived in Chicago to-day. He
left Manila April 3 on sick leave, being
one of the passengers on the transport
Sherman, which arrived in San Francisco
April 30. He is on his way to rejoin his
family in Massachusetts. In an interview
he said:
People In this country' who talk about the
war on the part of the Filipinos being for in
dependence do not know what they are talk
ing about. It is a war by a few scheming,
(â elfish leaders, who have resorted to desperate
methods to secure a following. Not only have
they lied and misrepresented in every possible
manner, but they also have resorted to In
timidation to keep their forces together. The
threat of death has been held up as the fate
of any who refuse longer to fight the Ameri
cans. Even to # counsel peace was to Invite
positive death.
The Filipinos are bravo, but they lack the
qualities the American soldier possesses. Their
marksmanship is wretchedly poor and they
are poorly officered. If they had been good
marksmen, the mortality In our ranks would
have been something frightful, for our troops
have been exceedingly reckless in the man
ner in which they have exposed themselves In
battle. This accounts largely for fatalities
which have come to them. Time and time
again, when a. good cover was offered our
men would stand up In the open and calmly
pick out their men. Of course, this Is brav
ery, but it has been the cause of many deaths
Had we been opposed by a foe skilled in the
use of firearms, I tremble to think what ou
death lists would have been. At the same
time, this reckless courage has gone a long
way toward terrifying and demoralizing the
Filipinos.
The volunteers have shown the most superb
courage. It Is needless to say what the regu
lars are. They can always be counted on to
do whatever is asked of them, and have proved
themselves to be the best soldiers J- the world
In my opinion the war Is nearly over, and
within a month peace will be established in
Luzon.

One Man's Attitude Prevents the
i Building of the Ellwood

SANTA BARBARA. May 11.âSuperin
tendent of Construction G. W. Boschi said
to The Call correspondent to-day that he
had reoelved orders from the Southern
Pacific officials to prepare to leave his
i wor ( k on the Eilwood-Surf line and go to
( Oxnard. the scene of the railroad con
struction In Ventura County. Mr. Boschi
j said that some time ago he received or
ders to obtain more wagons and mules
: for his work between Ellwood and Surf.
To-day orders came to obtain only such
wagons and teams as he would need for
1 his work at Oxnard. He Bays the stum
: Ming block is Louis G. Dreyfus, through
whose property the road must run for a
j short distance.
Mr. Boschi says he has a letter in his
; possession written by Dreyfus in which
the latter warns the contractors not to
enter his property and not "even tie a
j horse to any of bis fences." Dreyfus also
addressed a letter to Contractors Ramish
and Marsh, making similar threats. The
; Southern Pacific Company now holds
i deeds for a right of way through the
Dreyfus property, but by the new survey
the line has been changed, going a con
siderable distance from the Old line.
While the old right of way mad.' a line
between Dreyfus' house and barn, the
new line does not in any way affect the
value of the property. Dreyfus will not
consent to sell the right of way without
including several conditions which will
ft. abb him to have a hold on the com
pany.
Superintendent Boschi is prepared to go
t<; < Krard with his force of surveyors
There twenty miles of road will be built,
making the main line go through Oxnard. j
Rumors are afloat this evening that

and overwork, has requested the Board
of Prison Directors to meet at once and

The appointment of N. P. Conrey as a
Trustee of the Los Angeles Normal
School has given rise to widespread com
ment among politicians. Conrey has not
the favor of Burns, whose voice is gen
erally supreme In the matter of State ap-
E ointments. During the session of the
Legislature Conrey voted consistently for
Senator Bulla, who was generally re
garded by the Burns contingent as one
of the chief stumbling blocks in the path
of the colonel. Politicians say that the
appointment of Conrey is generally re
garded as an effort to hold out the olive
branch to Senator Bulla, who Is said to
feel keenly the loss of the Code Commis

Bulla has been able to control a great

RISKED A DUCKING TO
SEE THE NASHVILLE
Panic Among the Patriotic Waiting
for a Chance to See the
Gunboat.
ST. LOUIS, May 11.â A vast concourse
of people filled the levee from 10 o'clock
this morning until 5 o'clock In the after
noon eagerly awaiting an opportunity to
be ferried out to the gunboat Nashville,
anchored in midstream. The privilege of
transportation had been granted to but
one ferry company. In order that the
Nashville might not be overcrowded.
This company's wharf boat was
jammed. At noon the jam was Increased.
Suddenly a small child was pushed off
the wharf Into the river. Instantly a
policeman followed and as the water was
shallow the child was soon rescued. The
excitement, however, caused a panic and
several men were shoved over the edge
of the wharf. They waded out. At least
twenty-five women fainted and were In
danger of being trampled, but the police
succeeded In carrying every one out of
the Jam. Nobody was injured. Several
children fell Into the water during the
day, but were rescued before they got
beyond their depth.

noon dismissed the charge of attempt to
commit murder against Miss Anna C.

to Miss Egan, had she wished to In

she had every opportunity to do so. Merl

any other man would have done under
the circumstances. When he appeared
upon the scene he found Miss Egan and
his wife confronted by two men with re

the most natural thing for him to do was
to take the pistol from Miss Egan's hand
and defend the women with it. Tho
charges were accordingly dismissed. The
decision gives general satisfaction.

A GERMAN-AMERICAN'S VIEW
â Â« â
VIGOROUS PROTEST AGAINST
IMPERIALISM.
Talking to Stanford Students, the
Professor Bitterly Denounces
the Course of Great
Britain.
Â«
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May 11. -
Dr. Goebel of the German department
this evening delivered a lecture to the
students on "The German-American Pro
test Against Imperialism." He said:
The question whether the German-American
has a right to be heard in the political coun
cils of our country was answered by a his
torical review of the essential part which
German-Americans have played In the up
building of the rrpublio and in the develop
ment of American civilization. Thus it is
little known that from the ranks of the early
German settlers came, In 1688, the first pro
test against eholdlng ever made In Amer
ica. German-Americans participated, in large
numbers. In the wars of the revolution and
the rebellion. Their greatest influence upon
American civilization they have exerted
through their peaceful efforts in the fields of
Industry, social life, music, art and education.
Who, in the face of these facts, dare call our
civilization an Anglo-Saxon civilization? At
the beginning of our century the leadership In
the highest spheres of human thought and ac
tivity went to Germany. Thousands of en
lightened Americans looking for knowledge and
Inspiration have gone to tne German universi
ties and not to the fossilized institutions of
Oxford and Cambridge. The only contribution
to our civilization which England, in recent
years, claims to have found and which she
is so eager to have us accept is imperialism.
A history of the growth of the idea of
imperialism was given, and it was. shown
how a religious and mythic element was
gradually added to British desire for
colonial expansion. For a sober and truly
religious mind there is nothing more dis
gusting than the blasphemous attempt to
make religion thus the cloak for covering
British selfishness, the true aim of which
always was to rule and plunder her colo
nies. But the uneducated masses, the re
ligious fanatics and th. weak-minded jin
goes of our country believed this hypo
critical rant about the God-ordained mis
sion of the Anglo-Saxon race. Said the
speaker:
There is but one power which England fears
in her colonial and Industrial Germany.
Owing to her Industrial Jealousy England has
repeatedly been doing her best to stir up a
war between France and Germany. If Ger
many disappeared from the earth to-morrow,
an English paper recently said, every English
man would on the following day be the richer
for it. It is for thl_*same reason that Eng
land has been trying systematically to make
trouble between Germany and the United
States, and she came near succeeding in this.
We have believed all the Infamous lies which
the agents of England and the hirelings of
the yellow press last summer sent from the
harbor of Manila. We have allowed ourselves
to be used In Samoa as the violators of rights
and treaties and we are on the road to being
considered by the civilized world the rowdy
among the nations.
Eager to show the world the fraternization
of the Anglo-Saxon race an American officerâ
I am deeply ashamed to say, of German descent
âhas Joined the British In a brutal slaughter
of a savage people, although the commercial
Interest In Samoa of England and America
combined are not half as large as those of
Germany.
It la against the dangerous policy of a
people frenzied by the spirit of conquest, duped
and hypnotized by the British idea of imperial
ism, that we German-Americans Join the sober
minded, true patriots of this country in their
protest against imperialism. We protest
against the mad desire of picking a quarrel
with Germany, not on account of secret politi
cal sympathies with the old fatherland, for
we should, stand up like one man In defense
of this country were Germany to encroach upon
American rights. But we protest against be
ing made the tools of England's deep-seated
hatred against a country to whom we owe a
great part of our civilization. Being the off
spring of a higher and more humane civili
zation than the English, we protest against
the brutal and Inhuman warfare carried on In
the Philippines and Samoa. We do not believe
In the Mohammedan Idea of spreading religion
and civilization with the Bible in one hand
and the rifle In the other. We are not arro
gant enough to consider ourselves Instruments
In the hands of divine Providence. Know
ing by experience far better than many native
born Americans the priceless value of Ameri
can freedom, we protest against Imperialism
as a crime committed against the spirit of
American freedom and American institutions.
It is their American patriotism which to-day
unites the German-Americans from the At
lantic to the Pacific In protest against the
British Idea of expansion and Imperialism.
FIRE IN CANNERIES.
Sacramento Packers' Association's
Loss at Black Diamond.
ANTIOCH. May 11.-The Sacramento
Packers' Association's canneries at Black
Diamond, Contra Costa County, were
visited by fire on Wednesday evening.
Before the flames could be subdued the
cannery building, Icehouse, wharf and
fish-house were destroyed. The large
warehouse and mess were saved after a
hard fight.
The fire is said to have originated from
an explosion brought about by a watch
man carelessly opening a barrel contain
ing coal oil. It Is thought the gas that
had generated in the barrel had exploded
when the cask was opened and threw a
portion of its contents on the lantern
which the watchman had set down close
by. The flames from the burning oil
spread quickly to the wooden buildings.
A tank containing nearly forty gallons "of
coal oil was ignited, and a terrific explo
sion resulted. '
The damage Is placed at $25,000. The As
sociation carried $12,000 Insurance. Forty
men will be temporarily thrown out of
employment. The association intends to
rebuild immediately. In. the interim the
neighboring canneries at Benicla will as
sist the association to fulfill its contracts.

Special Dispatch to The Call, j
PHILADELPHIA, May 11.â The
j Business Men's Republican League of
Pennsylvania, which last fall put forth
special efforts throughout the State to
secure the election of anti-Quay can
didates for, the' Legislature, to-night
issued an address to the people of the
State, "congratulating them upon the'
progress made by the forces of good
government during the past year."
The address says the majority of the
members elected to the General Assem
bly for the first time in nearly a score
of years was anti-Quay and repudiated
Mr. Quay, "the head and front of that
corrupt and vicious political system
that so long has been a reproach to the
State." This anti-Quay body, the ad
dress says, exposed and defeated all
forms of machine-conceived corruption
and legislative jobbery. It continues:
The appalling chapter of crime, as de
velop, by the legislative Investigating
committee, showing a far-reaching con
spiracy to corrupt and bribe members of
the Legislature to vote for Quay for
United States Senator, should alone drive
from his support every self-respecting
voter of the State.
The principal State officer to be
chosen at the November election is
State Treasurer. Nominations for the
office will be made at the approaching
party conventions, and the league's ad
dress in concluding takes up this topic
as follows:
The control of the. State treasury,
which has been the fountainhead Of cor
ruption In the past, is not less Important
now, though the passage of th.- anti-
Quay interest bill compels the payment of
Interests on State desposits.
The Business Men's League has never
placed in the field a candidate for any
oltlce and desires only that proper men
be nominated. It is an organization (if
Republicans who wish to prevent party
disruption and disaster, with the convic
tion thai nothing but heroic action will
save the party from ultimate. State and
i national disgrace and defeat. For the
purpose of settling this controversy be
fore the Presidential contest of 1900, we
would make the following suggestion as
a means of terminating the strife within
the Republican ranks:
Let Mr. Quay himself become the ma
, chine's candidate for State Treasurer at
the ensuing election. Mr. Quay ha*
boasted of his readiness to go to the peo
ple for vindication. He. as State Treas
urer, inaugrated and fostered the system
. â ;' '"personal profit by the use of public
. moneys." which has been an important
issue in this contest. He represents In
every sense the evils against which self
respecting Republicans have revolted; he
Is the source and incarnation of the evil*
of the system which bears his name. Let
him thus make the Issue distinct and di
rect, leaving the final decision to the peo
ple. If Mr. Quay fears to submit his
candidacy to the people and In the face
of his repudiation by their direct repre
sentatives Insists upon claiming a seat in
the United States through the unlawful
act of a subservient Governor, he will
intensify and prolong the contest until he
1 is repudiated by a future Legislature and
precipitates disaster and defeat on the
other candidates who bear the stamp of
his machine.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, May 11. All of the evi
dence in the Murdock note case is in,
and every one interested feels relieved.
The strongest testimony for the de
fense to-day was thai of Allen Henry
and wife of Chico, who swore positively
that Mary Helen Murdock was at Allen
Springs on September 7, 1877. This di
rectly contradicts six prominent citi
zens, who testified that Mrs. Murdock
was on her husband's ranch at that
time.
When the plaintiff's attorneys com
menced the cross-examination of Mrs.
Henry, Attorney Freeman asked the
court to exclude Mr. Henry from the
courtroom. The. Judge ordered Mr.
Henry to retire. On cross-examination
Mrs. Henry contradicted her husband
in a number of important matters. Mr.
Freeman then asked that he be allowed
- until to-morrow to produce witnesses
to impeach Mr. and Mrs. Henry. The
court decided to continue the case and
announced that court would adjourn
1 until 9 o'clock to-morrow, and that he
would allow each side three days in
which to argue the case. W. M. Can
non will commence the argument for
the plaintiff to-morrow morning.

SHALL NOT COLLECT
IRRIGATION TAXES
Two Decrees Made by Judge Davis in
the Browns Valley Dis
trict Case.
MARYSVILLE, May 11. - Irrigation
bonds have received another setback, this
time at the hands of the Superior Court
of Yuba County, the case at bar being the,
South Feather Water and Union Mining
Company et al. vs. the directors of the
Browns Valley Irrigation District.
The status of the Browns "\ alley Irri
gation District was passed upon hers
some time ago by Judge Gray of pro
vide who was sitting for Judge Davis of
Yuba County in the hitter's absence, in
the findings it was shown the district had
not been organized according to law, nons
of the principal details being in legal
form. As that decision virtually settled
the future of the district as far as the
bonds were concerned, it only required
additional decrees restraining the officers
of the district from levying or collecting
taxes to pay any part of the principal 01
the interest of the $140,000 of district
bonds issued. _ -â - _ _.
Two decrees made by Judge Davis yes
terday complete this part, as one enjoins
the officers of the district from selling
property or otherwise enforcing the col
lection of taxes which have been levied
in the past; and the other enjoins them
from levying or collecting taxes for the
payment of principal or interest of the,
bonds in the future. This all follows an
a natural result of the first decision, when
the district was declared not to exist leg-
ally.
It is said on the best information to be
obtained that this ends bond litigation in
this particular case.
The district organization has not been
destroyed in fact, as that point has not
been reached by decree. The officers re
main and may proceed in such manner
as is deemed best for the owners of the
land, so that no taxes are levied or col
lected to pay bonds or interest on bonds.
Now that the Important point is set
tled the land owners in the district will
welcome all new comers who naturally
will seek this land when they know that
the title and the future are no longer In
doubt.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHARLESTON, S. C, May 11.â Th*
feature of to-day's session of the Con
federate Veterans was the memorial to
Winnie Davis. Speeches were made in
eulogy of her, the principal one being
delivered by Colonel. Bennett H. Young'
of Louisville, who paid his tribute to
the "Daughter of the Confederacy."
A resolution was unanimously adopt
ed extending the thanks of every
veteran to the people of the North who
so tenderly administered to Winnie
Davis at the time of her illness at Nar
ragansett Pier.
The Jefferson Davis monument com
mittee submitted the following report:
Resolved, That it is the earnest and
unanimous wish of the United Confeder
ate Veterans that the committer shall
undertake the patriotic task of building
the monument to President Jefferson
Davis at Richmond, Va., feeling confi
dent, as we do. that under the direction
the work will soon be accomplished and
we shall have in the capital city of the
Confederacy a memorial worthy of trie
President and of the people over whom
he ruled with such fidelity and wisdom.
A letter from Fitzhugh Lee excusing
his absence on the ground of his press
ing duties was received and read.
General Gordon then introduced Gen
eral Joe Wheeler, who was greeted with
great applause.
"While our Civil War was, I may
truthfully assert, the most sanguinary
recorded in history," said General
Wheeler, "it was also the most remark
able, as in it there was no element of
personal hostility. Men fought not
from revenge, but simply because they
felt that there lay the path of duty, and
the armies of the South laid down their
arms, but not one iota of their belief
in the truth and justice of their cause
did they surrender.
"Those upon whom rest the cares,
duties and burdens of government
have encountered no embarrassment or
complaints or criticism from Southern
States. None of their brave volunteer
regiments have asked to be returned
from fields of active duty, and when
the request has come from Governors
of other commonwealths, volunteers
from the Southern States have prompt
ly begged for the honor of filling their
places in the front of battle..
"The position in which the American
people find themselves to-day was not
sought by them, but is the logical re
sult of conditions thrust upon the coun
try by a course of events beyond our
control. The supreme test of Ajn-datua
institutions is involved, and the Ameri
can system of government is on trial.
"In one year we have risen to the
first place in the family of nations; to
make the â¢ smallest retrograde step
would be at the expense of the prestige
we have won. To return to the starting
point of a year ago would be to lose
what it would take a century to re
gain."
LEGAL FIGHT TO FREE
WARDNER STRIKERS

for a Writ of Habeas
Corpus.
SPOKANE. May 11.â The legal battle
for the release of the Wardner prisoners
began to-day, when counsel engaged In
dividually and by the Western Federation
of Miners filed applications for writs of
habeas corpus. The cases of County
Commissioners Stimson and Foil of Sho
shone County were the ones selected for
the test. Both men are in the stockade
at Wardner, guarded by colored soldiers.
Attorneys Morphy and Jones of Wallace
and F. C. Robertson of Spokane to-day
filed in the Circuit Court of the First
Judicial District of Idaho at Wallace an
application for a writ of habeas corpus
for the release of the two commissioners.
An order was issued commanding General
H. C. Merriam, State Auditor Bartlett
Sinclair and Coroner France, who are
charged with depriving the men of their
liberty without due process of law and
without cause, to appear before Judge
Mayhew at Wallace at 10 a. m. on Mon
day and show cause why the two prison
ers should not be released.
If the writ is granted and not obeyed
the matter will be rushed as speedily as
possible to the State Supreme Court and
on to the Supreme Court of the United
States.

SALT LAKE, May 11.â After approv
ing the president's address to-day the
convention of the Western Federation
of Miners devoted most of the session
. to the revision of the constitution and
by-laws. Th-> convention passed a
strong resolution against the annex?.- j
tlon of the Philippines. After a long j
preamble dealing with the subject the
report of the committee says:
Therefore be it resolved. That we. the j
delegates to the seventh annual conven- !
lion of the Western Federation ot !
Miners, protest against the annexation Of
the Philippines for the following reasons:
The working class of this community
will b-> obliged to compete with the-workr
ing class of the Philippines, thereby
bringing wages to a still lower standard.
This lavs hare the claims in favor ot an- !
nexntion that it would be a beneiit toitne
people Of this country. That the finding
of foreign markets will not beneiit the
producing class of this people who will
be obliged to suffer>a still further reduc
tion of wanes, thereby decreasing their
already limited purchasing â¢] power.
Resolved. That, recognizing our class
interests, economic and political; am! the
fact that the interests of the capitalist
,-las* alone are considered by our rep
resentatives In Congress in their discus
sion of the question of annexation, and
also recognizing the rights of the inhab- \
itants of these islands to self-government, ]
we call upon the working cl^ss to unite ;
at the ballot box in support of only
claÂ«!S-consclous socialists who stand for
the overthrow of the capitalist stem
and the establishment of a co-operative â â 
commonw< alth.
After some further observations the
eport concludes:
We believe that the only means of coun
teracting the evil effects of that gigantic
development of modern evolutionâ the
trustsâ is the education of the people
along the lines of socialism, that they
may be enabled to understand that in
stead of being a curse, it can be changed
to a blessing by simply changing the
ownership from private to collective.
Finally we recommend that some ac
tion be" taken whereby ill the working
p.'opli- of the W.-st can be brought to a
realization ,nf the necessity of united ac
tion at the polls, as the surest and speed
iest method of redress for all our griev
ances In nut opinion; the surest means
of attaining this object is through the
adoption and support in Its entirety of
the platform of the Socialist Labor party.
The resolutions were adopted by
a unanimous vote.
WESTERN LABOR UNION J
DISCUSSES RESOLUTIONS
Declares in Favor of Government
Ownership of Public
Utilities.
SALT LAKE May 11.â The greater part
of the day in the convention of the West
ern Labor Union was devoted to discus
sion of resolutions. Some of these have
been reported and indorsed in committee
of the whole. They relate to government
by injunction, the currency problem, a
national system of postal savings banks
and Government ownership of public
utilities and all monopolies.
The first item considered in convention
was that portion of the president's ad
dri ss referring to government by injunc
tions. The committee on resolutions re-
ported on this subject that in one particu
lar Instance, namely, at Wardner. Idaho,
government by injunction has been super
seded by martial law. The resolution of
the committee was adopted by the con
vention. A communication from Cripple
Creek was read in relation to the indict
ment of fifteen men of the labor organiza
tion at that place. The convention de
cided to extend such aid to these men as
the executive committee should deem
proper.
The subject of national postal savings
lianks for the benefit of the people was
next taken up. It was agreed that the sys
tem of postal savings banks, which lias
been so great an incentive to savings de
posits among the people of other "coun
tries, would be a good thing for the work
ing people of the United States, and the
resolution was passed favoring their es
tablishment by the Government.
On the money question the convention
spoke with equal emphasis, favoring th"
issue of money by the Government alone
and opposing a delegation of this impor
tant function of government to the mon
eyed corporations.
The question of municipal ownership of
public utilities was dealt with, and after
a harmonious consideration of various
phases of the subject the following was
adopted by unanimous vote:
Whereas. The private ownership of public
utilities, such as the telegraph, railways and
the telephone lines of the country, establishes
.-in unnatural ownership over the news fur
nished the public and is an unnecessory drain
on the resources of the people; therefore, be It
Resolved, That we believe It Is the duty of
the Government to take possesion of all natu
ral monopolies and control the same ln the
Interest of the people.
It was decided that the organization
phould have an official organ and a resolu
tion was adopted indorsing the project.
â¢JOINT SESSION HELD.

SALT LAKE, May ILâ The Western

bor Union held a Joint session this after
noon, with J. H. Husbey of Helena,
Mont., presiding. A general discussion of
the solution of the labor troubles through
out the United States occupied nearly the
whole time of the joint session. The tenor
of the discussion was for organisation and
unification it the labor organizations of
the country.
A resolution was adopted asking all
labor unions in California to join with the
miners' union in Randsburg and other
mining districts mar San Pedro harbor to
get union labor and union hours on the
Government work at San Pedro. The
Coeur d'Alene lining troubles were dis
cussed and the following resolution

trict and pledge ourselves to do all in our

IS SANTA CRUZ ISLAND
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW?
SANTA BARBARA, May 11.â The
trial of Peter Llnd, charged with
having crawfish In his possession
and thus violating the State law,
after having occupied the atten
tion of Justice Wheaton for three days
was given to the Jury, which agreed to
disagree, standing six and six. Many
interesting points of law were brought
out ln the trial and the old dispute as
to the waters surrounding Santa Cruz
and the other islands of Santa Bar
bara channel was again brought up.
The defense claimed that these waters
are not within the jurisdiction of the
State of California, for while its juris
diction extends three English miles
from the mainland it takes in the is
lands and nothing else, not even the
waters surrounding them.
Perhaps the argument of the defense
which had the greatest effect upon the
jury was that the law did not intend
to reach the fishermen themselves, but
that they were only acting as employes
of the San Pedro Canning Company,
and as the law provides means for
reaching the corporation Itself it is the
one to be punished for the infringement
of the law, as the fishermen, who had
no means of communication with the
mainland for two months, were ignor
ant of the law itself.
Peter land belonged to the camp
which was seized some time ago. He
was arrested at a small inlet on the
northeast side of Santa Cruz Island
known as Pelican Bay. This particular
part of the island is very rough and
during the greater part of the year it
is impossible to reach it by water. For

SERIES OF FIRES
VISITS KESWICK
Heavy Loss of Mountain
Copper Company.
â â¦ â
KESWICK, May 11.â For the second
time within twenty-four hours the
Mountain Copper Company has been
*a. heavy loser by fire. At 8 o'clock to
night fire broke out in the miichine
shops and round-houses, and before it
was subdued the company had suffered
a loss probably aggregating (50,000. It
includes the machJfee-shops, the
round-house, one locomotive, the pat
tern shop and the blacksmith-shop. It
at first seemed impossible to save the
smelters on the east or the stores and
offices on the south. The company has
an excellent system of water works,
good hose, heavy pressure and a well
drilled fire department. They all came
into good play to-night. For an hour '\
the fight was stubborn, but it finally !
was won. At 9 o'clock all hands were ]
called back to the furnaces, and the
streams of molten metal came pouring j
forth as though nothing had happened. ;
What effect to-night's fire will have
remains to be seen, but the company
will doubt do all it can to keep â 
things running fullblast. One thousand
or more men are directly employed by
the company, so it may be seen how
much was at stake to the laborer alone.
To-night's losses are covered by in
surance. The origin of the fire is un
known. It started in a small room used
for storing oil.
The Bachelor Hall building was de
stroyed last night. It was high on the
mountain side above the scene of to
night's blaze. Th- loss was $10,000.
All day long forest fires have pre
vailed east of Keswick, started by
sparks from last night's fire. Three
residences have been consumed. One
that was burned early this morning
was at least half a mile from Bache
lor Hall. This gives an idea of the
terrific gale that prevailed at the time
of both fires.

Two samples of the transactions in Ques
tion were transmitted to the Attorney
General's office, the "put" being re
ferred to in the decision as "Exhibit A"
and the "call" "Exhibit B." The report
says:
The transactions represented by the two ex
hibits are not taxable under the provision of
schedule A of the war revenue act. because
neither of them can be construed as a broker's
note or memorandum of sale. They do not evi
dence a sale, nor can they be construed as
executory contracts for sales to be completed
subsequently.
I am of the opinion that the exhibit A is
not taxable under any provision of the war
revenue act, for It is an agreement on the
part of the signers to buy stock, but the op
portunity is entirely dependent upon the dis
position of the party (trader) to whom the
paper Is given. There Is no provision In the
war revenue act, so far as I can find, which
taxes such a transaction,
I take a different .view, of exhibit li. In-Jhat

case the signer agrees to sell the stock de
scribed by the paper at the price mentioned,
provided the holder of the paper calls upon
him within the time specified. I think this
transaction is subject to the tax provided un
der that portion of the first paragraph of the

It Is true that the completion of this tran
saction depends upon whether or net the bearer
buys the stock described at the time or at the

to sell, provided the holder comes forward and
requests It.

A GLEAM OF HOPE
FOR MRS. MAYBRICK
Her Mother Confident She Will Be
Released in July
Next.
NEW YORK, May 11.â cable to the
Journal from London says: Baroness de
Rogues came from France to-day and had
an hour's interview with her daughter,
Mrs. Maybrick. Regarding this interview
the Baroness said:
"We now confidently hope to secure
Mrs. May brick's release In July. It will
then be just ten years since my daughter
was convicted, when, under English law,
the cases of 'life' prisoners are brought
before the Home Secretary for revision.
I believe that more cordial relations be
tween the American and British Govern
ments will lead to her pardon as a mat
ter of international courtesy, if not as a
matter of Justice."

VANCOUVER, B. C. May 11.â There is
a tight on at Nelson between the Cana

Salinas Valley Pioneer Gone.
SALINAS, May 11.â John Seals, a na

four days ago, suffering with heart trou
ble. Seals was 64 years old!
. Ranch Employe's Suicide.
WOODLAND, May 11.â Nat Cramer, a
laborer on Heppin's ranch, near Esparto,
committed suicide this morning by shoot
ing himself,,.... --
this reason and on account of the great
numbers of crawfish that are found
there the camp was so located by the
San Pedro Company.
The men from this camp were caught
loading on board the Lizzie Belle W,
the . 25-ton schooner which is in the
employ of the canning factory, several
crates, of fish, several tons in all, and
not only were the fishermen themselves
put under arrest, but also the captain,
mate and engineer of the schooner. The
officer's sloop, the Olita, was anchored
in Pelican Bay, and they rode across
the channel with their prisoners in the
Lizzie Belle W.
The trial of John Osterman began
to-day. He belongs to another camp,
and his case was considered a
stronger one for the prosecution than
that of those arrested in the Pelican
Bay camp, for in the one instance the
crawfish were found in their possession
and in the other they were caught in
the act by Officer W. W. Hopkins. Hop
kins had been lying in wait for these
men for several days, in the hopes of
catching them at their work.
While it is thought that these men
will not be found guilty, yet it is
known that these arrests will virtually
compel the San Pedro Canning factory
to close its doors for several months,
until the open season, when crawfish
can again be had. At the timÂ« of the
different arrests fifteen or twenty tons
of crawfish were liberated.
Over sixty talesmen were examined
to-day in the Osterman case, but only
ten jurors were sworn. The case may
take two or three days more.
KILLED THREE
OF HIS FAMILY
Bloodthirsty Crimes of
Joseph Harvey.
â â¦ â
HOWARD CITY, Mich., May 11.âJo
seph Harvey last night killed his wife,
his uncle, Robert Pierson, and his
grandmother, and also wounded his
three-months-old child and his father
in-law, Jc-hn Logenslayer. Then he
shot himself, inflicting a wound from
which he is expected to recover.
Harvey's uncle and grandmother live
a mile north of town. The murderer
went there last evening. He asserts that
Pierson, his uncle, was quarreling with
his grandmother, and that he inter
fered; that thereupon Pierson stabbed
and killed the old lady, aged 70, and
that he (Harvey) retaliated by shoot
ing his uncle. After shooting Pierson,
Harvey stabbed him three times. Har
vey then returned to his home, two
miles southwest of town. Arriving
there, he shot his wife twice, killing ;
her. He then fired at his baby, the ball
going Into its arm. He also fired at J
Miss Labard, a teacher, who boarded in
the house, but' she was not harmed.
Next Harvey entered his father-in- '
law's room and shot him twice, inflict
ing, however, no fatal injury. He then
turned the revolver on himself, shoot
ing himself in the neck. Harvey's wife,
when attacked, was sitting up with the
l â¢â¢mains of her mother, who died yesten
day.
Harvey himself to-day informed the
Sheriff of the murders at Pierson's
house. He was then arrested for murder
ing his wife. He has nothing to say of
the tragedies at his own^home. There
are strong threats of lynching.
The murderer's wound is serious, but
the physicians are sure he will survive.
He was employed in a furniture 'vic
tory and is only 20 years old. The cause
of his terrible acts has not been deter
mined. _________________

John C. ' Stevens, a court stenographer,
filed a claim against the Treasurer for
$117 for services performed, and the

Treasurer Truman to pay the amount
This the Treasurer still declined to ,i,',

The Supreme Court late this afternoon
decided that Treasurer Truman should
be released, holding that the proper pro

LONDON, May 11.â Tod Sloan opened
to-day's sport at Newmarket with a
sequence of three wins, arousing great
enthusiasm among the spectators. His
victory on Florio Rubetino in the Fly
ing handicap, was the most creditable
of the day. Florio was one of H. Mc-
Calmont's cast-off lot, having hitherto
been a very disappointing animal, but
to-day, after appearing hopelessly
beaten at the bushes, Sloan injected
new life into the creature and Florio
dashed up and snatched the race by
a head. ,
Vain Duchess was regarded as a sure
winner in the contest for the Breeders'
plate and Sloan got home without an
effort. The American contingent
plunged on Vain Duchess. The Even
ing Sun's race reporter says:
"One man wagered Â£2000, and I per
sonally saw the American backer,
Grannan, wager Â£650. There was no
big betting on Caiman, the winner of
the Payne stake, in view of the price.
Caiman won in a canter."
The Flying handicap is of 10 sov
ereigns each and 200 sovereigns added.
Rose Tree was second and Canadense
third. The betting was 2 to 1 against
Florio Rubetino.
In the Breeders' plate of 500 sov
ereigns, won by Vain Duchess, Tire
some was second and Papdale was
third. The betting was 13 to 8 on Vain
Duchess.
Lord William Beresford's Caiman,
ridden by Sloan, finished first in the
race for the Payne stakes of 15 sov
ereigns each, with 400 sovereigns added.
Footpad II was second and Sinopi was
third. Five horses ran and the betting
was 1 to 6 on Caiman.
A selling plate of 200 sovereigns was
won by J. Corlette's four-year-old
brown filly Arroyo. Sloan rode Sir R.
Waldie Griffith's four-year-old bay colt
'] Kurvenal and finished third. The bet
-1 ting was 5 to 2 against Kurvenal.
Arthur James' colt, O'Donovan

How the Railroad Gave Standard
Oil a Rebate Despite
the Law.
WASHINGTON, May 11.-The Indus
trial Commission to-day heard the first
witness to be called in connection with
its inquiry into the operation of trusts.
The witness was Hon. James W. Lee of
Pittsburg, attorney for several pipe
lines and oil companies, and formerly
a State Senator of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Lee's testimony was directed mainly
against the Standard Oil Company.
Speaking of the effect of trusts upon
the customer Mr. Lee said the tendency
was to increase prices until they be
came extortionate. Trusts were organ
ized to secure a monopoly, and when
this was secured by closing up rival es
tablishments they were in a position to
fix rices, which were, according to his
observation, generally increased in or
der to permit dividends on watered
stock. This had been eminently true
of the Standard Oil Company. As an
illustration, he said that when the Pure
Oil Company, in which the witness is
interested, went into the field ln New-
York, in 1896, it found the Standard
selling oil at 9*_ cents a gallon. The
price was almost Immediately reduced
to 5U cents, and remained there since,
the object being to drive out the rival.
The first price was inordinately high,
but the latter was ruinously low, and
while the independent company had
met the reduction, it had done so at a
loss. He thought the competition had
result* in a saving of fully $3,000,000
to the people of Greater New York.' The
same condition of affairs < misted at
competitive points.
Mr. Lee expressed the opinion that
the Standard Com] was still get
ting rebates from the railroad com
panies, despite the law . and he thought
this was accomplished by paying ex
orbitant prices for lubricating oil. He
estimated that the Standard Company
had within the past twenty years ab
sorbed about 100 Independent com
panies, but that the companies with
which he was connected had refused to
sell at an advance of 12^ per cent in
cost when they were about to be closed
by the Sheriff. This refusal had been
dictated largely by sentiment. Now,
however, the independent companies
were doing a profitable business.
He knew of several refineries which
had been purchased at high prices by
the Standard Company, and then had
been shut down. He had also heard
that men had recived a bonus to re
main idle, but he had no personal in
formation on this subject. Mr. Lee said
the Standard Oil Company had made
an effort to prevent th* extension of
the business of the independent com
panies to foreign markets by buying
up the tankage at given points and by
Belling at lower prices than prevailed
even in the United States. Still the
independent companies were able to
compete abroad largely, because in
Great Britain and in Germany and In
some other countries competition was
preserved to a greater extent than in
the United States. In Germany no one
as allowed to do business at a loss.
The profit mad* abroad was what.en
abled the independent companies to
continue in existence, as the business
in this country alone was unprofitable.
Mr. Lee also testified to the effect of
trusts upon the producer and upon
Labor, dealing exclusively with the oil
business. ]!â¢â  said the aim. of the
trust was to get a complete monopo
ly of business, fixing the price as it
pleas* and leaving little or no profit
to the producer. As an illustration, he
said the Standard Oil Company had
maintained the price paid for crude oil
at 05 cents per barrel for a year, and
that for the ten years prior to 1595 the
price paid had averaged only SO cents
per barrel, whereas the average cost of
production was not less thai $1.
He further expressed the opinion that
the counties in Pennsylvania which had
produced all he oil turned out in that
State, amounting to about 10,000,000
barrels, were worse off for its output.
Still there were some wells which were
remunerative, due to their high degree
of productiveness. As a matter of fact,
however, many of the oils produced
very little. Of the 60,000 wells In opera
tion 25.000 produced less than half a
barrel a day each. He thought if there
had been fifty refineries instead of the
Standard Company the market would
have been Just as extensive, the con
sumer would have secured his oil as
cheaply and the producer would have
been much better off.
"Where has the balance gone?" asked
Mr. Livingston.
"I think," the. witness replied, "the
Standard Oil Company could explain
that. The understanding is I hat it has
realized about $500,000,000."
Mr. Lee was quit confident that the
general effect of trusts was injurious
to labor. The effect was to deprive
laborers of competition, of chances for
employment when thrown out of work
and to make them subservient and
poorer citizens. Speaking specifically
of the Standard Oil Company's treat
ment of its employes, ho said they were
well paid and a certain class of them
receive very high salaries. Still, the
ultimate effect of any monopoly must
be Injurious to labor.
As a means of prevention of trusts
Mr. Lee suggested a law making de
structive competition a criminal of
fense. He thought the fear of imprison
ment would Intimidate some of them.
The law could be passed by the States
and in case of prosecution, prices
charged for years could be used as cvi

STOVE MEN PLANNING
A BIG COMBINATION
CINCINNATI, May 11.â The twenty
eighth annual convention of Stove Manu

While only temporary arrange
for the stove combine have been made,
it is generally believed thai the trust will
be formed. At to-day's session the ques

WASHINGTON, May 11.â General
I Greely to-day made the first authori
! tative statement as to the . progress
j made in wireless telegraphy under the
â¢ auspices of the United States Signal
i Corps. The Important conclusion is
! reached by General Greely that the
! wireless system is not likely to sup
| plant the ordinary method of tele
| graphic communication. The results
so far obtained have been uncertain,
General Greely's statement is as fol
lows:
Since the announcement of the tests
! in space telegraphy by Signer Marconi two
j years ago. the subject, has been under
j consideration by the Signal Corps of the
; army, and recently experiments have
i been begun to thoroughly test the value
j of this means of communication for mili
tary and other governmental purposes.
: Special apparatus has been designed and
i constructed for these tests, and they have
i already shown sufficient promise to war
! rant further systematic trials. :.,.-
In view el' the great public interest and
in order to facilitate experiments by other
' scientists in the United States, it is
deemed proper to put forth this statement
; of operations to the present time.
Transmitterâ ln the experiments thus
i far several forms of transmitter for the
! generation of Hertzian waves have been
; used, and much promise lias been realized
: from the use of a large alternating cur
â¢ rent coil in oil as a generator, instead of
'' the ordinary Ruhmkorff coil employed by
! Marconi. . This coil Is energized by a
i three-horsepower rotary transformer, fur
nishing 25 volts alternating potential, and
this arrangement makes a very powerful
and efficient source of Hertzian rotation.
Receiverâ The former receiver used has
been substantially the Brankey "Co
i herer," discovered in 1891, and the signals
1 transmits are recorded upon a reeeiv
: ing tape. â¢â¢
Th" emitter has been mounted upon
' the west elevation of the State, War and
Navy buildings, utilizing tie present
wooden flagpole as the vertical wire for
the transmitter. Th receiver was first
placid at the old Naval Observatory
grounds, about three-quarters of a mile
distant, and later moved to the Signal
1 Corps station at Fort Meyer, Va.
ring the experiments constant com
; munieation by heliograph and flag be
i twe^n the transmitting and receiving sta
j tions has been kepi up by the trained
j men of the regular Signal Corps, and this
: has greatly tacilitated the work of cx
i perimentinig. Signals, letters and words
| have been transmitted and received be
' tween those stations, but the great deli
' cai v and constant adjustment required
! in the present receiver have made the
â¢ transmission of regular messages as yet
1 unreliable and uncertain. _ne presence
iof large buildings and large mas â  of
Iron and metal necessarily present in
i cities make such places undesirable for
i carrying on experiments of this charac
i ter "The distance over which signals may
be transmitted by. a given apparatus is
a function of the height of the vertical
wire used in either .-nd, and this has
naturally suggested the use of small gas
balloons, such as have already been used
I for signal and other purposes by the Sig
nal Corps. A supply of these balloons
I has already been ordered and will be
! used for this purpose in the near future.
That there is a field of usefulness for
] space telegraphy is undoubted, but that
It will supplant to a material extent the
' use of wire for ordinary commercial
! telegraphy is not believed. Its value for
i connection between lighthouses and light
â  ships at sea and to replace ordinary flag
j methods in use between naval vessels,
i should prove invaluable, since darkness
I or storm have no effect upon Its use.
The use of metal reflectors to augment
' and direct the radiation to particular
i points has already met with partial sue
! cess and should be thoroughly investi
â  gated. At present the radiation proceeds
' from the transmitter In all directions and
: the same message can be received at any
point within the proper radius at which
a receiver Is placed. A satisfactory di
recting reflector and a receiver of the
proper electrical capacity, or, in other
words, tuned to the vibrations of the par
ticular transmitter, would make a great
advance In space telegraphy and do much
toward the extension of its field of prac
tical usefulness.
While secrecy of transmission Is among
the probabilities, the present stage of ex
periment does not justify Its positive pre
diction.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. May 11.â
Dr. C. C. Closson, who is measuring the
heads of the Stanford students in the
gymnasium here In an endeavor to obtain
data to substantiate the theory that the
shape of the human skull has much to do
with race movements and habits, will re
main at his post until the end of the
semester, when he will go to San Fran
cisco to pursue his Investigations among
the SwisV, German and French inhabit
ants there. Next fall he will take meas
urements at Berkeley similar to those
now being taken here. I
Dr. Closson has examined about 130
students. Although he has not com
piled the information obtained, he is able
: to say thai the large majority of the
men at the university are of tie long
headed, urban type, the chief character
istics of which are migratory activity,
energy, late marriages and small families.
lie is under tie Impression that there is
a much larger number of blondes at
{Stanford than in the Eastern colleges,
though in the shape of the head there is
no materia! difference between them. it '
is .asserted that Eastern college students
are more narrow headed than those in ,
Englapd.
his fact has an important bearing on ;
the statement that the long-headed type
of people is responsible for the settle
ment of this country. It is known that
i in the north of Europe the long-headed
. type predominates, but that it grows
weaker toward the south. Hence, the
fact that the students of the United
States are narrower headed than the
students of England shows that even
where the long-headed type predominates
; it is the most extreme cases of this for
mation that are the ones to migrate.
The Influence of their traits is one .if the
reasons why new countries .I.e. lop rapid
;ly until such numbers of the broad
headed or Alpine type, with their slow or
stationary habits and average intellectu
ality,-reduce the high activity of the
pioneers, when the growth is slower. The
same is to a certain extent true in the
birth and grown, ov towns and cities
The investigation being made by Dr.
''l.ss.i; and his colleagues in anthro
pological study have revealed some curi
ous facts relative to the population of the
â  United States. In the first place, it is be
lieved that tier. is a tendency for blonde
complexion and tall stature to associate
with the narrow. type of bead. It is
found from army measurement statistics
that the people of the United States are
â  taller than those of Continental Europe;
mat the people of the different nationali
ties who have migrated here are taller
i than their countrymen at borne; that even
â¢ th.- population of the Western United
States averages taller than that of the
East, while the people who come West
from Massachusetts are taller than those j
. left in Massachusetts. < ,-'
These strange coincidences of physical
characteristics with race" movements have
led anthropologists to arrive at the con
clusion that there were originally two
types of tain one short of stature, dark
complexioned, broad-headed and sluggish
in nature; the other, tall, narrow-headed,
blonde, unsettled in habits and of an in
quiring mind. The intermarriage of
those two types has brought about the
various kinds of men we have to-day, and
so it in no wise refutes the theory to find
a id-headed man with the mental and
domestic characteristics attributed to
the other type, and vice versa Never
theless, this seems to be the exception,
not the rule, and the general contour of
the head still stands as the clearest ex
ponent of permanent hereditary differ
ences in the human species. Not that
these eminent scientists believe in "bump
ology" and support fake phrenologists in
their assertions that they can tell by
fingering a man's cranium whether he Is
sentimental or sour, a thief or a parson,
a poet or a scientist, but the color of the
eyes and tie- size of the human stature
are liable to modifications by local cir
: cumstances, while the shape of people's
heads is little influenced by climate, food
; or habits.
This wide view of mankind is not of as
great importance to the particular group
of anthropologists to which Dr. Closson
i belongs, as is the question of social strati
fication and displacement. Society has
I often been likened to a pyramid, "whose
base Is th.- bono and sinew of the land
and the apex the upper classes, but this
likeness can be carried still fartherâ the
base being largely of the broad-headed
type of men, graduating toward the top
Into a predominance of the narrow-head
ed. The pyramid is constantly changing
Teople are dropping off at the top and
being recruited from the ablest represent
ablest representatives of the lower classes
It is known as a fact that several gener
ations ago the average family of genteel
parents was eight children, where now II
Is only two.
From the largo common class of society
grow two distinct classes one. the Intelli
gent middle class in city and country,
whose members have medium-sized fami
lies, but somehow fall to materially bet
ter their condition; and th.- other, the up
per class, with nervous, energetic charac
teristics and small families. Both of
these latter two classes, the majority of
whom are narrow-headed, tend to die out
but the number of generations necessary
to accomplish this has not been deter
mined. This is one of the tnings which
Dr. Closson, Dr. Sargent of Harvard, and
Dr. Ripley of Columbia are now attempt
ing to find out. and at the same time dis
cover the exact effect of education and
refinement on the size of the family
The study in California will afford data,
though necessarily incomplete, as to the
size of families among Callfornians. What
the ultimate result of the Investigation
in anthropology in Europe and the United
; States will reveal is only a surmise, but It
! Is liable to cause a reconstruction of ideas
[ as to the history of the human race, and
i will undoubtedly throw considerable light
I on our obscure past. Already me inves-
I tigations have led to a well-defined belief
| supported by solid reasoning, that the
; home of the Aryan race was In the center
. of Europe, rather than In India, and that
the blonde, narrow-headed type of man
: originated In Scandinavia, when that land
[ was larger and its climate more suitable
; for human habitation.

Pinish â How the Races
Were Won.
Â»
While dozens of California horsemen
are going hungry, their poor, weather
beaten charges neighing for a good feed
of oats, Ed Corrlgan, the curse of all that
is good and pure in racing, has race after
race placed on the programme for the
winners and non-winners of his string.
Thus does the man who ruined racing in
Chicago and sounded its deathknell in
Ban Francisco now seek to prostitute
this noble sport In the city across the
bay. He heads the list of winning own
ers for the entire season, but still his lust
for gold is insatiate. Leaving behind him
a trail of blood, misery and woe, he
sought this far Western country to re
coup his fallen fortune. Seated on a tot
tering throne, surrounded by a corrupt
court, how long will a long-suffering pub
lic bow subservient to this transplanted
ruler?
The above words were not written with
out something to be said in support . of
them. Caldwell's start in the opening
two-year-old race was nothing short of
shockingâ was disgraceful. Corrlgan
and his clique played St. Caslmir, and
Caldwell sent the youngster away flying.
He won handily from Hindoo Princess.
San Tomas had worked well enough to
"win a block," and was left at the post.
Five favorites won at this track over
the bay. borrowed from the California
Jockey Club by the exiles of Ingleslde.
This is not to be taken as a criterion of
honesty, for all five winners were heavily
played.
Betting on the six-furlong sprint, sec
ond on the card, was nervous and fluctu
ating. Sly opened favorite, receded to 13
to 5, then later had her price cut to 'J to
5. A plunge mad.- on High Hoe at one
time caused that mar.- to occupy the
place of honor in the betting. Horatio
and Alaria struck tic- stretch first, with
Sly an easy fourth. Ruiz on the latter
gradually forged to the front, beating
Alaria a head on th.- wire, with Horatio
a neck further away.
Charley Fink took the mile and a quar
ter event with his colt Ulm. Seven to ten
was laid about him In th.- ring, and he
won ail the way. Tempo, a 12 to i chance,
1. d the weak!;, ridden Castake out for the

With nothing to beat it was no more
than natural that Corrigan's good horse
Adolph Spreckels should win the mile and
a sixteenth selling. He Closed a 1 to 2
favorite, and in a fierce drive earned the
verdict over Malay by a nose. The finish
was such a close and desperate one that
many picked Malay as the winner.
A sprint for maidens followed, in which
Melftarth, backed from 12 to 6, led Santa
Lucia out three lengths. The favorite,
Mar dies, was unplaced. ..;'._..

Track Notes.
When the odds against Sly reached 13 to 5
the owners of the mare went to the Judges
stand and requested the retiring gentleman
reposing therein to kindly resurrect her. Ruiz
was read a lesson and Went out and won. If
the judges would keep a closer eye on the
fluctuating prices they might save the under
takers a heap of work.
The Hanlon Brothers have concluded to ship
Sly to St. Louis along with the string of
Hughey Jones.
It is said that Johnny Rclff has had about
enough of the game. Only a mite in the saddle,
he has been fined on numerous occasions by
Caldwell when not at fault, and Enoch \V ish
ard has about decided to keep his midget rider
on the ground.

ANTI-CEMETERY

Question to Be a
Campaign Issue.
â¦ â
CANDIDATES TO BE PLEDGED
â Â« â
STRIVING FOR A NEW SCHOOL
IN WESTERN ADDITION.
â¦
Lowell High School Said to Be la
adequate for the Demands
Now Being Made
Upon It.
The crusade against the cemeteries in
Western Addition which has been waged
for years was given fresh impetus last
night by the organization of the Anti-
Cemetery League. Dr. Charles V. Cross
was elected temporary chairman and E.
P. E. Troy temporary secretary. The
closing of the cemeteries will be made an
issue in the forthcoming campaign. It is
proposed to exact pledges from candi
dates at the primaries thai they favor
' prohibiting the further burial of the dead
; within the limits of the city.
For years politicians have been wary ol
the cemetery question. The men who
represent the cemetery associations have
made the assertion that thi owners of bu
rial plats constituted the bulk of the vot
ing population and would defeat an: man
or measure tending to close the ceme
teries. The claim is made that the oppo-
Bite is the case; that the general public
is aware of the fact that the cemeteries
are a menace to the health of the > city
and a bar to its progress. he grow
of the city is pointed as an example to
this. It is built up a mile beyond the
cemeteries toward the southwest^while
the growth has been retarded in tna
Western Addition and Richmond.
The officers of the new league expect to
derive their â¢chief support from the mem
bers of Western Addition Improvement
Club, Richmond District Improvement
Association and from the Bush street ami
tie- Polk street clubs. In addition every
Improvement club in the city will be re
quested to send one delegate to the meet
ing, at which the league will be perma
! nently organized. The present agitation
i- not for the immediate removal or tho
cemeteries, but for their closing. It is
expected the next twenty years will bring
about the actual removal of all the cleatl.
The agitation which has been maintained
! recently is slowly effecting what it has
been found impossible to bring about by
' legislation uo to the present time. ahe
: majority of burials now being made are
; In family plats sold by the Cemetery As
sociation years ago. Few people are buy-
Ing plats in the local cemeteries, prefer
ring to go Into Sat. Mateo County, where
their dead can rest undisturbed.
The meeting at which the -Cemetery
League was formed was called chiefly to ad
vocate the claims of the Western Addition
to a new high school building. The Lo
well High School building is said to be
entirely inadequate to meet the demands
made upon it. The following plan of cam
paign was determined upon: First to se
cure the approval of the Board of Educa
tion in the premises; second, to appear
before th" Supervisors and petition them
to allow for the expenditure in the pro
posed bond issue, and third, to procure
the co-operation of all the improvement
clubs. ' â¢ â¢â " â¢ -â¢..* . *' : " ,;;?_: "T_; i .-""â

Countless Numbers Who Suf-

HOW TO OBTAIN EFFECTUAL AND
PERMANENT RELIEF.
It is seldom that stomach trouble, or
liver trouble, occurs as independent affec-
tions. Disease of either organ usually in-
duces functional derangement of the
other. People who suffer with indiges-
tion usually suffer with constipation as
well, due to a decrease in the secretion of
bile. " â "";--: '."â 'â {â â â â ,
In order that one may . enjoy good
health, all the organs that are concern. .1
In the digestion of food must be in good
working order. There Is the stomach, tho
liver, the pancreas, the bowels, all of
which contribute to digestion. They are
all subject to deleterious Influences, and
as stated above, derangement of one af-
fects the other.
The Great Hudvan reaches them all in
its curative influence. It strengthens and
stimulates all these glands. Hudyan as-
sists in the assimilation of food -the con-
verting of it into flesh and blood. People
who suffer from liver and stomach dis-
order are nearly always thin and sallow.
Hudyan makes flesh and blood, restores
the glow of health to all pale men and
women. Hudvan will promptly relieve the
headaches that attend such disorders.
People with liver and stomach trouble
usually feel tired and languid. Hudyan
will give activity and energy to all such
sufferers. Hudyan will restore brain
quietude; it will produce natural steep*-

NAMED FOR OFFICE BY GAGE
Pierce of Yolo and Leavitt of Alameda for
State Normal School Board.
GOVERNOR GAGE has made another batch of appointments in which there is a sprinkling
of touts and politicians of a cloudy record. It is now obvious that he has fully made up his
mind to ignore the clean and reputable men of the commonwealth and bring to the front
second and third raters in the following of Dan Burns.
Paris Kilburn was the first of the Burns gang to be rewarded. Subsequently the office
of secretary of the Pilot Commission was given to Eddie Conroy, the confidential clerk of Burns.
Eon Brown, who has always been in the Southern Pacific camp, was placed on the State Board
of Equalization to fill a vacancy. Grove L. Johnson of the Burns Sacramento corral was ap
pointed to the State Board of Agriculture. He voted for Burns on every ballot cast for Senator
at the last session of the Legislature.
Gage's idea of how a Normal School should be managed is made known in some of his se
lections. For example. Frank W. Leavitt of Oakland, whose connection with the racetrack as
the programme publisher is well known, has been selected as a trustee of San Jose State Normal
School. He voted for Burns on every ballot. George W. Pierce of Yolo, who was censured by
his constituents for placing Burns in nomination, has also been selected to assist in governing the
Normal School at San Jose.
The following telegram from Sacramento shows that the Governor continues to be gov
erned: by Burn-;:
SACRAMENTO. May 11.â Governor Gage this evening made the following appointments: Trustees of the San
Francisco Normal Schoolâ M. Cooney, for four years; H. G. W. Dinkelspiel, for one year; F. A. Hyde, for three years;
W. G. Jobson for two years; Judge S. C Denson, for four years.
San Jose Normal Schoolâ Frank H. Short of Fresno, for four years: F. W. Leavitt of Oakland, for four
years; George Sweigert of San Jose, for one year; Dr. H. C. Brown of San Jose, for two years; George W. Pierce
of Davisville. three years.
The Governor also appointed Adolph Greenlnger of San Jose to be a member of the board of managers of the
State Hospital at '.â¢ vs, vice Frank H. Gould, who is at present a member of the Building and Loan Com
mission and disqualified. The appointment of George Sweigert and Dr. H. C. Brown of San Jose as trustees of
the Normal School at that place is regarded here as a m._k of recognition of the Governor's obligations to Jim Rea,
the San Jose boss, who is known to have advocated their selection. The actual compensation of the position of
trustee is small, but the patronage which the place offers is large and it therefore appeals to the consideration of
the politician. George W. Pierce of Davlsville, Yolo County, while a member of the Assembly, nominated D. M.
1 turns for I'nlted States Senator and stood by him from first to last. For this faithfulness he has been recognized
by Governor Gage, say the politicians to-night.
Another tribute to the potency of Burns was paid this evening, when Supreme Court Clerk George "W. Root
announced the appointment of Charles E. Bailey to be Deputy Supreme Court Clerk at the Sacramento office.
Bailey is a nephew of D. M. Burns. The salary is $150 per month, and the work is not of such an arduous charac
ter as to weigh the incumbent down with official cares. Bailey has been engaged as a traveling representative of
a San Francisco wholesale grocery firm. The appointment to-day of W. H. Seamans of Los Angeles as as
sistant secretary of the State Commission in Lunacy, at a higher salary than he had been reciving in the term of
service just closed, is regarded here to-night as effectually placing him outside of the probabilty of being chosen
Adjutant General, for which place it had been believed he stood a good chance. It is now pretty generally con
ceded thai th" appointment of Adjutant General will fall to J. C. Currier of San Francisco, who was chairman of the
executive committee of the Army and Navy League, which warmly supported the candidacy of Gage for Governor.

PETER McCLADE.
The prosecution occupied several days put
ting ln its testimony against the accused.
All official connected with the depart
ment who had any knowledge of the mis
deeds of McGlade, and some who had not,
Were examined. Handwriting experts
gave their opinions at length as to whose
hand traced the signatures on the various
documents and then the case of the com
monwealth rested.
It was expected that a week would be
occupied by the defense in an endeavor to
prove thai McGlade did not forge the
various warrants as charged, but the de
fense, evidently assured of victory on the
various technical points raised during the
trial, rested its case after McGlade had
taken the stand and briefly denied that
he forged the documents as charged in
the Indictments. Assistant District Attor
ney Black refrained from cross-examining
the defendant, and the trial was con
cluded as far as the examination of wit
nesses was concerned.
Assistant District Attorney Black's ar
gument was purely analytical, segregat
ing the various damaging statements
against the accused from the main body
of the testimony and placing special
stress upon them. The opening argument
did not occupy more than an hour, and
then Mr. Ready, Who represents the ac
cused began his address for the defense.
His argument was based solely upon the
contention that tip- prosecution had failed
tn overcome the presumption of Innocence
which the law raises on behalf of a de
fendant In a criminal prosecution. He
also, dwelt upon the contention that the
forged warrant, being void upon its face,
could not be the subject of an indictment
for forgery. Handwriting Expert ECytka
came In for a share of the attorney's sar
casm, and will doubtless suffer further
grilling before the case is submitted to
the jury. Mr. Redely will conclude his
argument this morning. Attorney Black
will close for the prosecution, and before
nightfall a verdict will be found.
MEDALS FOR THE SOLDIERS.
The committee appointed by the grand
president of the Native Sons of the
Golden West to prepare medals for the
soldiers of the First California, to be
presented to them upon their arrival
on American soil, met fast evening. The
full committee was presided over by
John T. Greany. The business transacted
during the evening was the formulation
of a general plan to be submitted to the
joint committee and grand officers at a
meeting next Saturday night.-
It was suggested that a committee be
appointed to prepare a roll of all those
who are entitled to medals or certificates;
also that a committee on finance and one
on publicity and promotion be named at
the next meeting. Another committee,
consisting of live members, will be ap
pointed to solicit, receive and pass upon
all designs for medals and certificates.
A committee, consisting of Morton C.
Allen. P. F. Byington and W. D. Shea,
was appointed to prepare an address or
circular to be sent to subordinate parlors
with a view of- obtaining their co-opera
tion and inviting the Native Daughters to
r">-ticipate. A committee, consisting of
\\. W. Shannon, James A. Devoto and Ed
Taafe, was named to interview the Mint
authorities and ascertain what work
could be done on medals in that institu
tion. The committee already has per
mission from the Federal authorities to
use the Mint machinery in striking off
the medals, providing the dies and ma
terial are furnished.
LADIES ORGANIZE
BANDS OF MERCY
CHILDREN TO BE TAUGHT TO
TREAT ANIMALS KINDLY.
The Movement Promises to Spread
Over the City and State A
Good Start Is Already
Made.
A number of lady members of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty met
I yesterday in the Parrott building and laid
I the plan for the organization of hands
lof mercy all over the city and State.
! Among those who have undertaken the
' work are Mrs. M. E. Holbrook, who pre
i sided. Mrs. H. G. Goodrich, Mrs. S. Paul
son, Mrs. S. ]?. Whiting and Miss M. E.
! MeGraw. Mrs. Holbrook stated that the
j best way of teaching the people to be
I merciful to dumb animals Is to begin with
the children and educate them from the
. time they are able to talk. Once the
! idea Ie Implanted in their minds thai they
I have no right to abuse and maltreat the
dumb animals under their care it is never
I eraser), and the child thus Impressed will
always be a protector to the lower order
of creatures. Much of the cruelty prac
ticed comes from Ignorance and thought
lessness.
She stated thai In nearly every city of
importance in the United States bands of
mercy have been organized among the
\ children and every member of every band
seems to feel that he or she has been
appointed a special protector of animal
life and welfare. The moral effect upon
the older generation is particularly bene
) licial, and many a big, strong, quick
tempered man has beep made kino and
thoughtful to his horses and dogs through
the influence of his child. As in tin- East,
so must the real work be done hereâ
among the children of the public schools.
Already fifty bands have been formed in
public schools and the movement must
not be allowed to die for the want of
support and encouragement, and there Is
no better organization for this work than
this society. It was decided by those
present that all of the ladies of the so
ciety should be aroused and Induced to
assemble at the same place two weeks
hence.
In the meantime a committee of ladies
will visit the public schools and keep up
the work already started. This commit
tee will solicit donations for the purchase
of badges to be given to the members of
every band, and the purchase of humane
i literature. In the meantime the commit-
I tee will take up the matter of giving
every band a name and number for the
! badge. The ladies feel much encouraged
j over their first efforts in the cause of hu-
I mane treatment of animals.
THE ODD FELLOWS.

suing term. In accordance with the usage
1 of this order the deputy grand master and
I the grand warden were promoted. W. A.

THE PIONEER CHAPTER.
Thirtieth Anniversary Celebrated by
an Entertainment in Aid of the
Masons' Home.
Golden Gate Chapter No. 1. Order of the
Eastern Star, the pioneer of that order
In this State, was founded In this city
thirty years ago by William S. Moses and
his wife. Addle Warren Moses, both still
active members of the chapter. The
members some time since decided to cele
brate the anniversary by an entertain
ment and dance, charge an admission fee
and donate tho proceeds to the Widows'
and Orphans' Home at Decoto, in Ala
meda County.
The entertainment was given last night
in Golden Gate Hall, and it was attended
by a large number of the numbers and
friends. Judging from the number pres
ent quite a sum will be raised lor the
home. The programme offered had for its
features a dissertation on "The Wheel,"

by Miss Mabel a. Richardson, assisted by
Mioses Grace Qulnn, Flora Colvin and
Bertha Schllds. The several numbers
were all high class and were well re
ceived. The dance followed, and the suc

BOYCOTT IS INDORSED.
The Building Trades Council, at Its
meeting last night, adopted resolutions
indorsing the labor boycott against the
firm of Siebe & Green and advocating its
rigid enforcement.
The council also decided to investigate
all the circumstances in connection with
the strike of the miners in Idaho, which
culminated in the blowing ' up of the
Bunker Hill and Sullivan mill and the
order of General Merriam forbidding the
employment of union miners in the mines
of the district. A strong sentiment was
developed at the meeting against the ac
tion of the general before the guilt of the
miners had been established by an im
partial trial.
A committee consisting of P. H. Mc-
Carthy. E. J. Brandon. T. D. Conness, J.
Massey. G. W. Oaks. P. Hannon. W. H.
Goff and W. Ryan to act in conjunction
with a like committee from the Labor
Council In arranging for the celebration
of Labor day was appointed.
MONOPOLY'S FIGURES
TELL THE WHOLE TALE
Actual Cost of the Manufacture of Gas by
the Allied Companies Here.
A Clear Profit of $1000 on Every Million Feet
Sold According to the Very Best Show
ing They Can Possibly Make.
THE gas monopoly of San Francisco [
becomes hysterical at the bare men- ;
tion of a rate of $1 10 per thousand j
feet, and a concerted cry of "confis- ]
cation of property" arises from the down
trodden members of the. corporation.
If one were to go to the office of either
of the companies comprising the monop
oly and ask for a statement showing the !
cost of the manufacture of gas he would
be overwhelmed with figuresâ the com- j
pany's figures, ready at hand and passed
out to Supervisors and other inquirers !
whenever called forâ showing that $1 75
I a thousand barely covers the cost of man- '.
i ufacture and distribution, leaving just ;
'â  sufficient surplus to pay Interest on its
â  stock. And every officer and employe of
the company would willingly furnish an ;
! affidavit as to the correctness of the fig- j
I ures, too.
But the companies have other sets of j
figures bearing on the same subject which
are not given to the public, and are not |
Intended for any eyes but their own.
These figures tell a far different story.
Here is the substance of a report turned I
I in to one of the local companies forming
the monopoly by an employe. It is not
necessary to say how the report reached
the outside, for it was obviously intended
for nobody but the heads of the corpora
tion; It is only sufficient to state that the i
figures given give the top prices of ma
terials, and can be scaled in some re- j
spects, notably for petroleum, materially. I
First.' however, it may be well to give an ,
idea of the process used in the manufac
ture of gas In this city. Five gallons of
petroleum distilled (the residue of petro
leum after extracting the lighter fluids,
such as gasoline, benzine, etc., all of
which constitute a source of revenue)
; will make with superheated steam 1000
1 feel of gas. A charge of 323 pounds of
â¢ coal is placed in the retort and burned
for ten minutes, until the retort has at
tained I'""! degrees or more of heat, then
90 gallons of distillate, a spray of super- |
heated steam, are injected Into the retort
for ten minutes. The gas then passes on ]
I to the purifier, through the usual process
to the gas holders ready for use. Ten j

SESSION OF THE EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE OF THE STATE.
#.
Preparations Made for the First Pri
mary to Be Held in San Fran
cisco Under the New-
Law.
;-/;> _
The Committee of One Hundred which
led the Democrats of San Francisco to
overwhelming defeat in the political cam
paign last fall is still recognized as the
Democratic governing body of San Fran
cisco. The executive committee of the
Democratic State Central Committee at a
meeting yesterday directed that the One
Hundred should not. at the approaching
primary election, deprive the voters in the
separate districts and precincts of the
right to nominate and elect their own rep
resentatives.
The session of the. executive committee
at the California Hotel yesterday after
noon was not in any sense exciting. Chair
man Seth Mann addressed the assembled
party leaders and In his words Mayor Phe
lan. R. M. Fitzgerald, A. Caminetti, C. O.
Dunbar and J. C. Gallagher listened. The
Mayor held the proxies of Wright and
Sea well, and the chairman was reinforced
by a proxy or two. The chairman did
not endeavor to darken wisdom with a
multitude of words. He made the point
clear to his Democratic brethren that he
recognized the Committee of One Hun
dred as the governing body of the local
Democrats. He maintained that it was
important that the One Hundred should
be advised that districts and precincts
were entitled to vote for deb-pates under
the new primary law. He did not com
mend the plan of State committee Inter
ference in local affairs and recognized the
fact that suit) Interference did not pro
mote party success.
Mr. Gallagher moved that a committee
of three be appointed to consider the sub
ject of apportionment. When Mr. Galla
gher made the motion he did not under
stand that Mr. Fitzgerald had a cut and
dried set of resolutions to follow Mr.
Mann's convincing address. When he saw
that his motion was not seconded he
perceived his mistake and refrained from
further exhibitions of premature zeal. Mr.
Fitzgerald then introduced the following:
Whereas, The Democratic party In San Fran
cisco is now entering upon a municipal cam
paign of vast Importance to the Democrats of
San Francisco and of the State at targe; and
Whereas. We now have upon the statute
books of 'he State a primary law whose funda
mental principle is that the will of the people
should be ascertained by primary elections
separately held in small political subdivisions
and conducted under the forms and safeguards
of law; and
Whereas. Local government is best preserved,
the will of the people most easily determined
and Democratic principles best maintained
when the vote of the people is registered and
cast in the smallest political divisions which
can he expediently and conveniently made; and
Whereas, The custom-, of late years too preva
lent, of ruling the Democratic party of Ban
Francisco through the highest governing body
of the party In the State, has not prevented
factional disruption and internecine strife; and
Whereas, Such Interference is only to be
Justified as a last resort, when all other meas
ures have failed; and
Whereas, In the last campaign the methods
that were pursued culminated in the appeal of
the Hon. Francis J. Heney denying the legality
of the last municipal convention of 100, and
the resolution before this body of the Hon.
M F. Tarpey, denying the legal right of the
committee of one hundred to exist ; and
Whereas. It is commonly reported that it is
proposed to apportion at large the delegates
for the municipal convention to be voted for at
the coming primary election and to have a
small number of delegates and thus tend to de
prive the voters in the separate districts and
precincts of the right to nominate and elect
their own representatives: and
Whereas. If such a plan were liable to be
consummated It would be the imperative duty
of the State Central Committee, having at
heart the best interests of the party, to take
per cent of coal gas is mixed with this gas
to give It body.
One retort can manufacture 1,000,000 feet
of gas every twenty-four hours. A retort
is operated by five men, whose daily
wages aggregate $13 50. Under the old
system 01 manufacturing gas it required
sixty-five to seventy men at the benches
to make the same quantity. The wages
of these men averaged $250 a day, so that
right at the start the company now saves
In the wages of sixty men $150 a day. A
retort costs $13,000, so that the company
saves the price of one in wages alone
every three months under the present sys
tem, besides saving the wear and tear
of benches, use of coal and other Inci
dentals. On a basis of five gallons of pe
'â  troleum for 1000 feet of gas (and this is
the estimate of the gas company official)
it requires 5000 gallons to make 1,000,000
feet, which at 5 cents a gallon (the cost
given) amounts to $250. But the cost is
variously estimated by others at I 1; to 4
cents a gallon, which would materially ;
reduce the pas man's estimate. Then ;
23,000 pounds of anthracite Wallsend &
Gretna coal at $8 a ton. or a total cost
of $S0 a day, are required. This, with
$13 50 daily wages of five men, the cost of
petroleum at their own figures, and say
an allowance of $70 a day interest on the
investment, which is very liberal, brings
the cost of manufacture, according to the
company's own figures, to $413 50 per 1,000,
--000 feet. The company manufactures
about 1,250,000 feet a day. To this the
Company would add office expenses, in
cluding eighteen collectors, six meter.men
and twelve members of the office force.
The cost of delivering gas Is 10 cents per
1000 feet, although the monopoly In its
public statements gives the cost at 50
i cents.
One million feet of gas at $1 75 per 1000
amounts to $1750. while allowing the fan
ciest of fancy, salaries for the office force,
collectors and metermen and 50 cents for
delivery, would not bring the total cost
of manufacture up to more than $750,
which leaves a net profit to the company
of $1000 on every 1,000.000 feet of gas.
Twelve hundred dollars .or even $1300
profit would be nearer correct if the exact
figures for the latter expenses could be
got at. , ; ' ;
Just think how that poor monopoly will
suffer If it is compelled to do a legiti
mate business and sell gas at $1 10 per
1000 feet.
such steps as would in its Judgment give a fair
representation.
Resolved, That we, the Executive Committee
of the Democratic State Central Committee,
direct the committee of one hundred of the
city and county of San Francisco that Demo
cratic success In the coming municipal cam
paign In San Francisco can be best secured by
fixing the number of delegates to th" coming
municipal convention at a number large enough
to be democratic and representative of the
party in each district of the city, and by ap
portioning the delegates by districts or pre
cincts In such a manner that voters shall vote
a' the primaries to be held under the present
law for delegates from their own precincts or
Assembly Districts; and
Resolved. That this committee dismiss the
Henej appeal and the Tarpev resolution.
Resolved, That copies of these resolutions be
forwarded to the chairman and secretary re
spectively of the committee of one hundred.
A. Caminetti. who for some unaccount
able reason had not previously spoken on
the subject, moved that the resolutions
be copied and a copy be transmitted to
each member of the State Central Com
mittee. 'â 'â -'..* ,
The chairman reminded Mr. Caminetti
that the last day for filing the apportion
ment was July R.
Mr. Caminetti spoke again, and acquired
his customary fluency after, hr uttered
a few words. He said: "We interfered
and made a muddle. Let us stop all in
terference. If we must Interfere, let us
interfere to some purpose. Let us strike
out the word 'advise' and insert the word
'direct.' Let us direct the Committee of
One Hundred to provide for precinct ap
portionment."
Mayor Phelan remarked that no. one,
present advocated a blanket ticket. "I
am in favor." said the Mayor, "of district
representation, but I am opposed to In
serting the word 'direct' in the resolu
tion."
The committee decided by a vote of 0 to
3 to direct the Committee of One .Hun
dred. Mayor Phelan voted in the negative,
but did not vote his proxies on that propo
sition.
The resolution as amended was adopted.
On the adoption the vote was unanimous,
the Mayor voting his proxies In the af
firmative.
It was the expressed sense of the meet
ing that the State Central Committee
should he advised of the action of the
executive committee, but haste in calling
a meeting of the State Committee was not
deemed advisable. Â'.
A BULL-TERRIER CLUB.
Fanciers Who Take an Interest in the
Fighting Breed of Dogs.
Bull-terrier circles are agitating the
formation of a club devoted to the Inter
ests of that popular breed. Last evening
a number of prominent bull-terrier fan
ciers met at the office of the Breeder and
"Sportsman and organized a strong spe
cialty club. The officers elected were:
Phil J. Fay, president, and R. H. Roun
' tree, secretary-treasurer. A committee
was appointed to draft a constitution, by
laws and submit a plan for perfecting an
organization. A meeting will be held May
24 to complete arrangements. Among

Improving Richmond.
The demand for building lots in Rich
mond within the past few years has been
the means of extending Improvements to
outside territory. Twelfth avenue, that
a short period ago was considered in the
wilderness, is now being put in condition
for residence purposes.. A contract has
been let to Felix Mcllugh to put in a
sewer on this avenue between Clement
and California. The same contractor has
the macadamizing of Seventh avenue, be
tween C and 1) streets, as also the plac
ing of a sewer in C street, between Sev
enth and Eighth, together with a number
of smaller contracts on street crossings,
where corner buildings are about to be
erected. . : â¢ : â¢
The proposed northern extension of
Golden Gate Park, taking in a strip of
one tier of blocks between Thirteenth and
Fourteenth avenues, has given an im
petus to owners of property in the near
vicinity of this place to put the same ln
building condition. â â â 'â â 
President George R. Fletcher of the
Point Lobos Improvement Club has suc
ceeded in convincing the Park Commis
sioners of the necessity that exists for an
opening Into the park at the junction of
First avenue and Fulton street.
The Commissioners have given Super
intendent McLaren instructions to make
an opening at this place as soon as he
can get his men and trams at work.
The increase of children attending the
public school in this district has made it
necessary for the improvement club to re
quest trie erection of a larger building
than the one now In use. which is over
crowded and ill adapted for the number of
children who attend it.
An Old Lady Disappears.
The disappearance of Mrs. Catherine
Hays, 905 Buchanan street, was reported
to the police yesterday by her husband.
She Is slightly demented and slipped out
of the house Wednesday morning and has
not since been seen or heard of. She is
72 years of age and wore a light calico
dress and brown cape. She was hatless.

CONVENTION OF
WEATHER OFFICIALS
FORECASTER McADIE SANGUINE
IT WILL COME HERE.
One Hundred and Fifty Delegates
Will Discuss Extension of the
Benefits of the Service.
Alexander McAdie. who is in charge of
the local weather bureau, is sanguine
that the next convention of the weather
bureau officials of the United States will
be held In this city in October. He is
now busy opening tip correspondence with
his brother officers in different States
and expects by this plan of campaign to
make a concerted request upon Willis
L. Moore, chief of the department, in
whose hands the selection of the conven
tion place now rests*
At the last convention, which was held
in Omaha, it was found impossible to
decide on the meeting-place for this year.
Delegates Pindell and Bates spoke for
Chattanooga, Tennessee. Professor Wil
liam Hammon, who was in charge of the
bureau in this city and did much in the
cause of its advancement, made a strong
plea for San Francisco, and was seconded
by Mr. McAdie. who was then In charge
of the New Orelans office. The other in
dividual preferences were: Mr. Pague for
Portland, Oregon; Mr. Cline for Galves
ton. Texas; Mr. Conger for Detroit. Mich
igan, and Mr. Mitchell for Jacksonville.
Florida. No vote was taken and the mat
ter was turned over to the Chief of the
Weather Bureau.
In discussing the prospective coming of
the convention to this city Mr. McAdie â 
said:
"There will be at least a hundred and
fifty delegates at the next convention of
Weather Bureau officials, and the pros
pects are very encouraging that it will
be held here. My plan of campaign will
be to communicate with the officials
throughout the country and show the
benefits which will accrue to them and the
service in general by coming to the West
ern metropolis. By journeying to this
extreme point they will learn consldera

"San Francisco is getting to be quite a

will also be offered for their investiga

"The main business that will come be

gates who went away and did not say
'I have learned something."
"As each man pays his own expenses
the railroad should offer some indue

with it. and I propose to have a confer

see if certain concessions cannot be ob

THE SHAMELESS COMMISSIONERS.
OFFICIAL weakness, falseness, cunning and
corruption have not been rare in California of
late years, but as a rule the guilty officials have
paid to virtue the homage of hypocrisy and have tried
to keep up an appearance of efficiency and honesty.
It has been left for Railroad Commissioners EHack
stock and Laumeister to parade their betrayal of pub
lic trust with an impudence both shameless and arro
gant.
These two men seem to have lost their reason al 1
together. In the face of the decision of Judge Mor
row that the suit in his court growing out of the grain
rate cases could not be dismissed by them or the
State, the defendants in the suit, they have resolved
and ordered the Attorney General to dismiss it any
how. It is clearly their intention to proceed no far
ther in the fight against the Southern Pacific, even if
they have to drag the case out of court by main force.
Such a determination could not have been reached
by any process of reasonable counseling. It is, there
fore, not surprising to learn that the consultations of
the aggressive ---spelling pair have been con
ducted., not in the offices of the State, but in what for
euphony may be called the wine-room of the Herrin
house. It was in the seclusion of the residence of the
head of the Southern Pacific law department that the
scheme was discussed and the bold resolution taken
to scorn the Judge and scoff at his decree.
When officials of the State charged under oath and
under pay to fulfill certain high duties and enforce
the law become the convivial gossips of the violators
of the law, it is a sure thing that the interests of the
State are to be betrayed. Officials having an honest
intention to perform their duties to the people who
pay them would not go to the private house of the
attorney for an offending corporation to devise plans
for action. It is, therefore, a safe assumption that
the consultations at the Herrin house were not di
rected toward the protection of public interests, but
toward their betrayal.
Nor have the two Commissioners stopped with one
betrayal of public trust. They have exhibited evidence
of an intention to act upon the advice of Herrin on
every case that comes up. The issue of the Stockton
differentials, for example, is one that should be
promptly decided. As Commissioner Edson pointed
out at the meeting on Tuesday, the Stockton people
have been waiting four months for some decision to
be made. Blackstock and Laumeister, however, re
fused to act. The former, indeed, is reported to have
said in reply to Edson's urging that the case be taken
up at once: "I don't believe we should do anything
with it until this rate case business is fixed, and when
it comes to further consideration of it you can count
me out. I've got cases in court and can't attend
special meetings."
Such is the attitude which these sworn and well
paid public officials have assumed toward the State
and the people. Their duties they ignore. They seem
to have but two desires â to hobnob with Herrin
and to snatch that grain case out of Judge Morrow's
court.
Gf?S COMPANY EXTORTIONS.
ONE of the most hopeful signs of the times in
this city is the earnestness with which the
people have engaged in the struggle to de
feat the long-practiced extortions of the gas com
pany. When The Call began the contest some time
ago in an effort to break down the illegal demand of
the company for a deposit from each consumer, com
paratively little energy was displayed by the public
in the issue. As the case developed, however, and
The Call made its points one after another, popular
sentiment was aroused. The Board of Supervisors
recognized the justice of the claim of the public and
reduced the rates, and when the company, with its
usual arrogance, demanded payment from consumers
at the old rate, a movement was started to organize
an association of consumers to resist the extortion.
At present, therefore, the outlook for a complete. vie- â¢
tor} for the people is promising.
That the rate of Si 75 per thousand feet for gas is |
extortionate has long been known. The very fact that
other cities of anything like the population of San
Francisco arc supplied with gas at rates not exceeding
$1 was itself a proof of it. Yesterday, however, The
Call published figures showing that experiments and
tests made by the engineer at the Agnews State Hos
pital reveal that gas even in the limited quantity used
at that .institution can be produced for 55 or 60 cents
per thousand feet. Of course large operations arc
always proportionately more economical than small
ones, and therefore it is safe to assume that the cost
of producing gas for this city is much less than that
at Agnews. Thus the extortion of the company is
completely demonstrated.
The fight is now on in earnest, and nothing is
needed but perseverance and united effort to accom
plish a great victory for the public. No citizen
should submit to the extortions. The company is
pursuing an illegal course and cannot possibly win if
the people resist and stand up for their rights.
APPOINTED SENATORS.
THE Washington correspondent of the Boston
Transcript, discussing the seating of appointed
Senators, says:
"Each case has been decided upon the personal in
terests and. party considerations involved. Or, more
accurately, a practice in this regard will run for a
number of years, until some case of exceptional in
fluence reverses it. and then that is taken as a prece
dent until another striking case on the other side
comes up. Until 1825, for example, the Senate gave
seats to all Senators appointed as Mr. Quay has been.
But in that year the attention of the Senate was
specially directed to the Lanman case, and after an
exhaustive debate it was decided that he had been
improperly appointed."
It is difficult to crowd, more misrepresentation of
fact into the same space. The first case was decided
in 1794, when several men who had been members of
the Constitutional Convention were members of the
Senate. The decision was that when a Legislature
had been in session and had failed to fill an existing
vacancy in the Senate the Governor had no jurisdic
tion and the seat must remain vacant until the Legis
lature chose to fill it. In 1825 the Lanman case was
decided the same way on the same grounds, and the
principle thus fixed has never been violated nor re
versed by the Senate. It is not true that "each case
has been decided upon the personal interests and
party considerations involved."
Senator Edmunds of Vermont, one of the great
lawyers of the Senate, in discussing one of these
cases said: "This question was fairly debated when
the gentlemen on the other side were in a majority
in this Chamber. Without a party division gentlemen
on both sides voted according to the light they had,
and, not dividing on party lines, settled this identical
question. The Senate sitting upon such a question
sits as judges. The constitution says so. We are not
defining policies; we are not setting up expediencies;
we are not carrying on party warfare. We are sitting
as the solemn judges sworn to try and determine the
election and qualifications of a gentleman who pre
sents himself to be a member of this body. We. have
come to a decision, just as the Supreme Court of the
United States, sitting 200 feet from us. comes to a
decision in a great variety of cases, when the Judges
differ, five one way, four another. The decision of
the court is announced. What would become of that
court if the next time a similar question came up the
whole thing was opened again and the contest was
gone over repeatedly from year to year and time to
time in order to see which should get the ascendancy
upon all questions? Nothing would be settled and
the court would be destroyed, and justice, too, for that
matter. How is it different here? When we have
come to a decision, even in a case of doubt, having
come to it fairly, not in a time of party heat or by a
party vote; when we have come to a decision, after
full deliberation, which carries out confessedly the
objects of the constitution, should we not stick to it?"
From this and the rollcalls on the many cases de
cided it is plain that neither "personal interests nor
party considerations" have influenced the Senate.
Senators acting under oath and sitting as judges
would betray every obligation resting upon them if
they let personal interests influence them in the de
cision of a constitutional question.
That a party majority would not be and never has
been influenced by party considerations is evident
from the fact that already having a majority in the
Senate there is no necessity to violate the constitu
tion for partisan advantage.
The San Francisco Bulletin, which supports the ap
pointment of Burns, says:
"The rejection of Corbet* of Oregon, though in ac
cord with precedents, was largely influenced by the
fact that Senator Burrows of Michigan had* personal
reasons to desire that the precedent which Corbett
fell a sacrifice to should be preserved. Burrows was a
candidate for re-election, but the Governor of Michi
gan was opposed to him, and had influence enough to
; deadlock the Legislature. If Corbett had been seated
! on appointment by the Governor a precedent would
| have been established that would encourage the Gov
| ernor to throw his influence against Burrows and
| thereby secure to himself the appointment of a
Senator."
It would be hard to frame a better statement of the
constitutional reason for denying jurisdiction to the
Governor after a Legislature has failed to elect * a
Senator. The Governor of Michigan could dead
lock the Legislature and thereby secure to himself
the appointment of a Senator! It is to prevent just
that sort of thing that the constitution provides: "And
if vacancies happen, by resignation or otherwise, dur
ing a recess of the Legislature of any State, the
executive thereof may make temporary appointments
until the next meeting of the Legislature." The Bul
letin makes its statement to prove the contention that
the Corbett case went off on ''the personal inter
ests" of Burrows, whereas the admission that Gov
ernor Pingree stood ready to deadlock the Legisla
ture to secure to himself the right to elect a Senator
is a clear demonstration of the wisdom of the Senate
in adhering to the constitutional rule. If it be de
parted from, what Pingree stood ready to do in
Michigan will soon become the rule. Governors
having the disposition of State patronage can easily
so use it as to tempt Legislatures not to elect Sena
tors from whom not much patronage can be had, and
it is not an improbability that very soon the Senate
would be filled by the creatures of executive power.
AN EXTRA SESSION OF CONGRESS.
WHILE there has been no official announce
ment of an intention on the part of the Presi
dent to call Congress to assemble m October,
i the report that he has the subject under consideration
' comes from sources sufficiently authoritative to jus
| tify its acceptance by the public. The rumor is the
I more credible because abundant reason for the call
; ing of such an extra session is to be found in the
political situation.
In the first place there are many grave issues to be
dealt with by Congress, and it is advisable from every
point of view to have them settled before the opening
of the Presidential campaign of 1000. The banking
and currency question ought certainly to be closed
! before that time so there may be no financial agita
j tion and uncertainty to disturb business during the
I struggle for the- Presidency. Moreover, the issues
j involved in our dealings with Cuba and the Philip
| pines cannot be determined by the executive alone.
i Congress must act with him in their solution and
settlement. '
In addition to the finance and the war issues there
are other measures of far-reaching importance to be
considered. Our expanding commerce imperatively
demands an increase in our merchant marine, and it
is high time something were done by the Govern
ment to promote our shipping industry and place it
in a condition to compete on equal terms with the
i subsidized marine of European nations. The Nica
i ragua canal project should also be taken up this win
ter, and a permanent form of government adopted
for Hawaii. t
To effectively deal with all these measures, in addi-
I tion to the routine work of the session, will require
THE SAN FKAJN CISCO CALL, FIUUAI, MAY ; 13, JBWf.
considerable time, and if Congress be not called to
gether early, the session may be prolonged next year
until late in the summer and possibly until fall. Thus
we might have Congress in session and a Presiden
tial election going on at the same time, and that
would be an indisputable case of /too much politics.
The situation is complicated by the retirement of
Reed. The Republicans of this Congress . will not
have the advantage of his experienced leadership.
A new man will have to be chosen, and 'so many can
didates are in the field the choice will probably be
difficult. It will also take the new Speaker consider
able time to appoint his committees and get the
House organized for business. That fact is in itself
a good argument for calling Congress to assemble
earlier than usual, and the President will be acting
with his usual sagacity if he do so.
RECOGNITION NOT PRAISE.
JUSTIFIABLE commendation of a judicial
officer must be disinterested, because the very
qualities that produce that kind of appreciation
prove his indifference, so far as the administration of
the law is concerned, either to praise or to blame.
The pure conscience, the high intelligence, the faculty
for closely knit reasoning, the self-control, the color
less impartiality, that blend in the highest practical
standard of judicial character and ability, in all ages
have deserved and received the deepest resect and
the most exalted honor.
In the latter years of this century political degrada
tion has affected some of our courts, and, though in
no inconsiderable degree unreasonably and unjustly,
distrust of the judiciary prevails, and, therefore, when
in the face of all obstacles and influences a Judge sit
ing in great cases proves his power of abstracting
himself from every immaterial question and of ap
plying the law with perfect directness and simplicity,
the very least the press and the public can do is to
recognize the fact.
This is the secret of the eulogistic references to
Judge Morrow of the Circuit Court of the United
States that have become so common in this Slate
and in other parts of the Union. As presiding Judge
of the District Court of the United States, after an
honorable Congressional service, he succeeded Judge
Ogden Hoffman, whose father was one of the most
distinguished pleaders in the country, but who
achieved for himself a most enviable reputation for
scholarship, for legal acumen and above all for un
questionable integrity. Judge Morrow, while he re
mained District Judge, in no way discredited his pre
decessor, and when, upon the appointment of Judge
McKenna to the post of Attorney General of the
United States, he succeeded him as Circuit Judge, it
was felt by the people that in that tribunal at least
â equality before the law would be not only an ac
credited theory but a vitalized reality.
The result has fully justified public anticipation.
Absolute confidence is felt that before Judge Morrow
every suitor of every degree, whether high or low,
whether a natural or an artificial person, stands upon
exactly the same basis, and that in that temple of
justice the gasconade* of the demagogue and the
subtlety of the casuist are equally useless. This fact
has been illustrated on so many occasions that it is
unnecessary, as it might be indelicate, to specify any
particular instance, even of recent occurrence.
There is scarcely any evil that a constitutional re
public cannot endure if the administration of the law
i- not only pure but searching and firm. It is gratify
ing to know, in the midst of the multiplied corrup
tions that infest Legislatures and even executive
offices, that there are places where the citizen is not
compelled to borrow a fine suit of clothes and to se
cure some indorsement from wealth or power in or
der to protect his interests or his rights. There have
been times when, in respect to the Circuit bench,
whether justly or unjustly, great uneasiness was felt.
I* is quite sure that public confidence in that tribunal
has now been fully restored.
THE HUNTINGTON WflY.
1 7 HEN Mr. Huntington came to California
WHEN Mr. with words of promise on his lips
this spring with words of promise on his lips â¢
and assured the people of the coast counties !
that at last work on the gap would be undertaken in
earnest, and that the through line would probably be
in operation' within a year, he was received with wel
come. In their expectations for the future many peo
ple forgot the past. They trusted Mr. Huntington.
Now it appears the promise of the Southern Pa
cific magnate was only another of his deceptions.
He obtained rights of way for his railroad across the \
gap about nine years ago, and about once a year on
an average ever since he has made a promise to" grade j
the line, lay the rails and get to work. His coming
and his going to and from the State have been marked '
by the remnants of these broken promises. He can !
be tracked by them as unerringly as a bear by his j
trail.
It will be remembered that in his promise of this
spring Mr. Huntington declared he would long ago !
have constructed the road had it not been for the j
opposition of his wicked partners. It was. he said, !
his desire to close the gap, but the other directors of I
the Southern Pacific were not willing. According to i
his words at that time, the antagonists of the im- ,
provement were Mrs. Stanford and the Crocker?.
Now he finds a new antagonist in the person of !
somebody along the line who will not do as Mr. Hun
tington desires.
It is not easy to see what remedy is available to the j
people of the coast counties. Huntington was beaten !
in the San Joaquin because that broad valley fur
nished ample room for a competing line, and one
was constructed. Along the coast, however, compe
tition is not easy. Huntington cannot get even with
the farmers of the San Joaquin by wronging the peo
ple of the coast, but he can at. least gratify his spite
against the State, and he seems bent upon doing it.
That is his way.
King Tanu of the Samoan- Islands has gone â  on
strike for an increase in wages. He was getting $50
a month and now demands $150 or blood. The diffi
culty with which his Highness keeps his job and his
head from the savage onslaught of his princely ene
mies seems reason just enough to grant the increase.
Promoters of bullfights in Mexico complain of a
scarcity of bovines fitted for the sport. Governor
Gage might increase the comity between the two na
tions by shipping over the line some of the terrific
bulls he has made.
Dispatches from Kansas are to the effect that a
cyclone visited the central portion of that State Tues
day night last. It cannot be possible that Brigadier
General Funston has returned unexpectedly from the
Philippines.

NAMING A LABOR COMMISSIONER.
To the Editor of The Call: Governor Gage has announced that before making
a selection for the Important office of Labor Commissioner he would like to have
the names of five men submitted by organized labor, thus permitting the work
men to separate the wheat from the chaff and at the same time leaving no
loophole from which in the future critical shots can be taken at the appoint
ment made.
- As one of the rank and file I beg leave to ask publicity for the following sug
gestion, believing that if it is adopted, or something of a kindred character, the
Governor's wish can be met and unnecessary friction be avoided in labor circles:
There are three Allied Labor Councils in this Stateâ San Francisco, Sacra
mento and Los Angeles. These councils represent the various trades organiza
tions in their respective districts. Let each council select one man as its choice*
by doing which the three most important points of the State will be represented.
Then each council should appoint a committee of one, which committee will be
instructed to select two additional members at large. The committee of five thus
created is then to determine who the remaining two names shall be, making
the five to be submitted to Governor Gage.
To my mind .this would be a just and equitable solution of a question which
is of vital importance to the members of organized and unorganized labor In this
State. The Governor's action will depend largely upon the spirit manifested by
the men to whom', will fall the carrying out of his expressed desire, and if
wrangling and bickering are permitted and the selection delayed Mr. Gage may
conclude to ignore any and all recommendations and select some one not thor
oughlyqualified for this very important position. - F. J. GREGORY.
FELL AT MALOLOS.
Private Thomas Thompson, Third Ar
tillery, a Native of San Fran
| cisco, Aged 20.
News of the killing of Thomas Thomp
son, a private In Battery X, Third Artil
lery, was confirmed by letter received in
this city yesterday. "When the report
of the day's dead on March 26 was wired
to this city Thompson's parents were not
positive as to whether it was their boy
whose life had been sacrificed, but recent
mails brought a letter from a comrade
who had seen the unfortunate soldier fall
and to whom had been intrusted a last
0 -â¦_$> -#.- _#.-.*,_â¦_ <Â£> _Â»_ ,J> -^_ ,s. _â¦_<Â£>_â¦_ Q
message of love to his mother. The let
ter told the heart-broken parents how
their boy had- been in the thickest of the
fray at Malolos and how a Filipino bullet
had pierced his breast. He died on the
battlefield, but before he expired he faint
ly called for his mother.
Thompson was the son of Nils Thomp
son and resided at "245 Twenty-third
street in this city. He. .was little over 19
years of age when the trouble, with Spain
commenced, yet he resolved to join the
army. All efforts to restrain him proved
futile, and he was among the first to en
list. His father had been a soldier and
there was something of an old war spirit
in the boy's veins.
Thompson was employed as a locomo
tive fireman for the Southern Pacific
Company until -the time of enlistment.
On the day he was killed he was 20 years
7 months and 23 days old.

ANARCHIST AND SOCIALISTâ '
City. An anarchist is one who advocates
anarchy or the absence of government as I
a political ideal; one who is an adherent
of the social theory of Prudhon. In the '
popular sense, one who by violence seeks
to overthrow all constituted forms of |
government and society, all law and or
der and all rights of property, with no
purpose of establishing any other sys
tem of order in the place of the one de
stroyed. Socialism is any theory or sys
tem of social organization that has for
its purpose the abolishment entirely or
in greater part of individual effort or
competition on which modern society
rests and to substitute for it co-operative
action; the more equal distribution of the
product of labor, and to make land and
capital, as the instruments and means of
production, the joint possession of the
community. Apply these principles to
Washington. Patrick Henry. Abraham
Lincoln and William Jennings Brvan and
you yourself can answer the question, !
"Were these anarchists or socialists?"
EMBASSADORâ ReguIar Subscriber, j
City. Diplomatic usage recognizes three
orders of Ministers. Ministers of the first
class possess the representative character i
in the. highest degree, representing the I
state or sovereign sending them not only
in the particular affairs with which they
are charged, but in other matters; they
may claim the same honors as would be
long to their constituent if present. The
first, class of diplomatic agents Includes
papal legates and nuncios, and embassa
dors oruinary and extraordinary. Minis
ters of the second and third order have
not the same strictly representative char- ,
acter; their representation is held not to !
go beyond the affairs with which they are !
charged. They are. however, the natural
protectors of. the subjects of the state or
country sending them in the country to
which they are assigned. Ministers of the !
second class Include envoys, whether
these are simply so styled, or denominated
envoys extraordinary, also ministers plen- :
ipotentiary. he third class of Ministers
do not differ from the second in the de
gree of their- representative character, but I
only in the diversity of their dignity and
the ceremonial with which they are re- i
ceived. This class comprehends Ministers,
Ministers Resident, Ministers Charge
d' Affaires, such Consuls as are possessed
of a diplomatic character and those
Charge d Affaires who are sent to courts ;
to which it is not wished to send agents
with the title of Minister.

"Hold that train!'- shouted Coroner Hill
yesterday forenoon, as he drove into the

Third and Townsend streets.
Th.^ horse' which the Coroner was driv
ing: was covered with lather and almost
â¢ diapsed when its owner and Deputy-
Coroner John Gately alighted from the
In the baggage- oar was a coffin contain
ing the body of Joseph Cooper, a well
known tailor, formerly of 140 Powell
street. The deceased hud been found dead
in bed on the morning of the Sth inst.
The air in the room was full of the fumes
of illuminating gas and a stopcock turned
on told the rest of the story;
Dr. Josef I. Manson of 'At Van Ness
avenue was called in. and after an x
amination of the body pronounced Mr.
Cooper dead. He then signed a death cer
tificate- to the effect that he had been at
tending the deceased for the past three
months, treating him for heart disease,
and that that ailment caused his death.
The certificate went to the Board of
Health in the usual way and being reg
ular on its face was countersigned.
Coroner Hill was not notified at all.
The first inkling his deputies had Of thr
matter was a rumor which floated into
the Morgue last Wednesday night to the
effect that Qdoper had committed suicide.
An Investigation was begun and the Cor
oner succeeded in learning the facts just
in time to halt the funeral train which
was about to pull out for San Mateo
.:.--. at 11:30 a. m.
Considerable opposition in the way of
; r â¢:- st was made by the relatives and
friends of the deceased, hut the Coroner
insisted on his prerogative and had the
body conveyed to Dierck's undertaking
establishment! where an autopsy was Im
mediately held by Morgue Surgeon Za
tia: Dr. Zabala reported that there was
no trace of heart disease, but that, on the
contrary, all the evidences of gas as
phyxiation were present, including tho
brightly colored and fluid condition of the
blood, "which infallibly denotes the toxic
action of carbon monoxide.
Coroner Bill thereupon summoned a
jury of business men to view the body
"and" set the inquest for 10 o'clock this
J. Cahaien called at the Morgue in the
afternoon and reported a conversation he
had had with the deceased a few days
before his death. Mr. Cooper had lost his
wile about a > ear ago. his business had
cone wrong and he was very despondent.
MV told Cahaien that bis life was insured
for $6000 and he asked whether the nrntiey
would be paid to his heirs in case of hi_
suicide. - .

eight months I have been attending him
constantly for heart trouble. I called at
h;Â« house last Sunday and he was in a
i mgerous condition. I ordered him to
: immediately and told him then that
he was in a very critical condition and
would have to take good care of himself.
He was in such a condition that his death
at any moment would not surprise me a
particle. After leaving him on Sunday I
heard nothing more until Tuesday morn
ing, when one of the family called me up
and requested me to come to the house
immediately. I called about S o'clock in
the morning and found Johnson dead. He
had been dead several hours, and nat
urally I concluded that heart disease had
caused his death. When I first went to
the house the family told me that they
had already called in Dr. Hart, but that
he refused to attend to him because i had :
been treating him. I did not dream that
Johnson came to his end from any cause
ether than heart disease. His heart was
really in a critical state and liable to
bring about death at any moment. Had
the family dropped the slightest hint that
he died of unnatural causes I certainly
would have refused to sign the death
certificate."

FOR LACK OF PROSECUTION.
The Charge of Perjury Against Fred
Foster, the Horseman, Dis
missed.
A. Howard, the Austrlian plunger, and
Fred Foster, the horseman, have appar
ently settled their differences in regard
to the horses Yellow Tall and Sam M -
Keever. Yesterday, when the case of
Foster charged with perjury on the com
plaint of Howard, was called in Judge
Mogan's court, it whs dismissed.
Attorney D;innÂ« for Howard said that
it would take at least four weeks to try
the case and it would put the city and
county to needless expense.
Howard took the stand, and in answer
to the Judge said he did not desire to
prosecute the case, and on that showing
the Judge dismissed it. Foster is still
under heavy bonds to appear for trial in
the Superior Court on the charge v>f ob
taining money by false pretenses from

THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, FRIDAY, MAY 12, 1899.
TO SLAY SEA LIONS
ON THE FARALLONES
; PERMISSION GIVEN BY TREAS
URY DEPARTMENT.
The Raid on the Rookeries of the
Fishkillers Will Begin Next
Weekâ Much Red Tape
Used.
Permission has been granted by trm
Treasury Department at Washington to
the State Fish Commission to thin out i
the sea Hon herds on the Farallones. Ar.o i
: Nuevo and other lighthouse reservations
under the charge of the Government.
When the commission determined that i
the reduction of the sea lion herds was I
necessary to the fisheries industries of
this part of th* coast an obstacle was
presented by the fact that nearly all of I
the big rookeries are on Government^
: lands and the' beasts could not be dis
j turbed without permission: so a letter
was sent to the proper authorities. Thai
; the request has passed through enough !
red tape Is shown by the correspondence
i that has passed the hands of the several
authorities at Washington. But at last
; the request was granted, the most im- J
portant letter being from acting Secre
tary of the Treasury O. 1,. Spaulding, in I
, which he says:
Your letter of April 20, 1899, which is in
dorsed by Senator Perkins, asking permission'
; to send deputies to certain ligmhouse reserva
tions, among which are Ano Nuevo, the Faral
lones. Point Reyes and Point Arena, to re- ;
duce the number of -.i lions was referred to i
] the Lighthouse .-..card for consideration and
! recommendation. In reply the department ;
states that the Lighthouse Board bad direct
ed the lighthouse inspector of Ban Francisco j
to permit the landing of such persons as you j
may delegate for killing a part of the seal j
herd tor such time as he may think nece*- j
i sary at the Farallones, Ano Nuevo and i th. !
I lighthouse reservations under such instructions !
and regulations as he may deem necessary ln
the Interests of the lighthouse service.
Accompanying the letter was a set of.
rules and regulations, which those who i
go forth to slay seals must observe, which i
lay down the law in the following ex- j
plicit language:
Rules for the men who land at Farallon i
and other lighthouse reservations to shoot sea j
lions:
1. The men are to selected by the Fish |
Commission, and no others to be allowed to !
land.
2. They are' In no way to Interfere with
the keepers, the management of the light or
fog signal, and will comply with the direction
Of the keeper in regard to their actions while <
on the reservations.
3. They will not kill birds or engage In
egging or kuiing any animals except . sea
lions. WLiHg
4. The animals killed must not be left to
decay on tl.'e land.
5. They will take their own bedding, food
and cooking utensils to the Farallcn^s. The
keeper will be instructed to permit them to
sleep in one of the buildings.
6. At Ano Nuevo Island it may be possible
to arrange with the keeper to board the man.
so food need not be taken there.
7. The keeper will be Instructed to report â¢
any violation of these rules or of the rules I
of the lighthouse service, and If necessary he* '
will send any one violating them off the reset-- .
vatlon the first opportunity.
The Fish Commission has decided not i
to send forth the hunters until some time i
next week, owing to Al Wilson, th. chief ;
hunter, being engaged in the prosecution
of fish dynamiters in one, of the Interior
towns.
Had Another Husband.
The marriage of Henry E. Beguhl to
Dora Beguhl was annulled yesterday by
Judge Daingerfield on the ground that
when the marriage ceremony was per
formed between the parties the defendant
had another husband living in the person
of Charles E. Corey. Corey disappeared
some years ago, and his wife read a story
in a newspaper that a man answering the
description of her husband and bearing
the same name had been drowned at San
Diego. She immediately concluded that
he was her husband and entered into a
marriage contract with Beguhl. She lived
with Beguhl for nine years, during which
time three children were born to them.
A short time ago Corey appeared on the
scene, and the result is that a decree of
annullment was granted on the applica
tion of Beguhl.
j Suit on a Thresher Patent.
The Holt Manufacturing Company of
j Stockton filed a suit in the United States
Circuit Court yesterday against the

Offers to Assist the Brother If He

Off to South

-â¦
Benjamin Bloch. the wayward brother
of Ellis Bloch. a member of the well
known firm of W. Hirch. Cohen & Co..
languishes In the. City Prison with a
charge of vagrancy against him and a
threat of a more serious accusation to
consider. Bloch was arrested at his
mother's home at 601 Broderick street by
Sergeants Duke and Martin, at the insti
gation of his brother Ellis, who fears he
will do injury to other members of the
family or further disgrace their name.
Ellis Bloch, accompanied by Lieutenant
of Police Birdsall. visited the City Prison
last night and had a long talk with the
prisoner. He begged the latter to leave
town and volunteered to aid him if he
would go to South Africa. On Benjamin
declaring his purpose of going to an East
ern city when liberated, his brother
threatened to have him incarcerated in
the County Jail for six months. The di*.
cussion became heated and Ellis was
heard to exclaim: , _ *_
"You have cost us thousands and thou
sands of dollars already," to which the
prisoner replied that the statement was
untrue Benlamin told his brother at
parting that If he were released he would
start for Chicago to-day, but his brother
would not see it in that light, and
watched unconcernedly as the prisoner
was taken back and placed among crim
inals of the worst type.
The prisoner In talking of his troubles
candldlv stated that had he known the
officers" were comlne for him he would
have been elsewhere. He denied that he.
had intended to Injure members of his
family No one would take him tor a va
grant He was . neatly dressed, and
showed by his talk that he is a man of
intelligence. He said he was able to con
verse in six languages and was also an
expert penman and accountant. He also
stated that his wealthy brother had paid
a number of his debts, but he declined
to give their amount.
T^e prisoner said his father. A. a.
Bloch the late well-known merchant who
died three years ago. left on estate val
ued at $100,000 to his widow.
Since his return to this city Benjamin
has been living in idleness with his
mother, and this fact has caused the up
heaval in the Bloch family. Bloch was
Imprisoned a few months ago for threats
to Inflict injuries on his relatives, but the
charge was dropped.
Every effort is now being made to keep
the son's downfall from his mother.
ATTORNEYS EXCHANGE
FISTICUFFS IN COURT
FRANK H. GOULD AND GEO. W.
HOWE IN A FIGHT.
Judge Kerrigan Deals Out Stem Jus
tice in the Form of Fines and
Imprisonment.
An impromptu fight occurred in Justice
Kerrigan's courtroom yesterday morning
that for the time being absorbed the at
tention of the fortunate ones who hap
pened to be present. The principals were
Frank H. Gould, lawyer and politician,
and George W. Howe, a disbarred attor
ney at law. Honors rested with Gould,
but before Judge Kerrigan completed his
self-appointed task of rebuking the con
testants both were somewhat groggy in
the vicinity of their pocketbooks.
The case of Mac( vs. Cohen was up
and Gould asked for an immedi- |
ate hearing. Howe made reference to
' Gould's attitude when the case was being
j heard in the Police Court and said that
j at that time Gould was anxious for a
continuance.
"That was an infamous suit brought by
â an infamous person." declared Gould,
glaring at Howe.
"Do you mean me"" asked Howe.
"Yes. you are the person I have refer
' ence to."
"Then you are a liar and a cowardly |
â  cur." ejaculated Howe, advancing in a \
menacing attitude.
He did not get far. Gould led out with
I his good right and caught Howe on the I
'â  nose, sending him to the floor in a heap.
At this point, and before any one had ;
\ time to count ten on Howe, bystanders j
: rushed in and hustled Gould from the ;
: room. Howe, gory but unconquered, rose \
! to his feet and apologized to the court.
"I cannot overlook such a flagrant con
i tempt," said the Judge, waving the bleed
i ing penitent aside. "I will impose -a fine I
'. of $25 on Mr. Gould, and as you appear \
i to have been the aggressor I will fine you |
! $25 and will impose an additional punish- i
j ment of twenty-four hours' imprisonment
j in the County Jail."
Howe was handed over to a couple of !
Deputy Sheriffs and hustled off to jail, j
Later in the day he secured his release i
on a writ of habeas corpus issued by Su
perior Judge Murasky.
The writ of habeas corpus sworn out |
on behalf of Howe was cahed for hearing
before Judge Murasky at the opening of
the afternoon session. George D. Collins .
represented the petitioner and George B.
Kcane appeared on behalf of Justice Ker
rigan. Attorney Collins made a technical
fight for the liberty of his client on the
ground that the commitment simply
stated that the acts committed by Howe :
were "intended to interrupt the due
course of the trial," instead of "tend- ,
ing to interruDt the due course Of the
trial." Mr. Collins contended that the
word "intending" simply denoted a men- ,
tal process on the part of the petitioner, i
and if such Intent did not result in the in- !
terruption of the trial no contempt was :
committed. Judge Murasky, however,
held that the words "intending" and
"tending" are synonymous and denied the
writ. A stay of three days was granted
at the suggestion of Attorney Collins, and
in the meantime the Supreme Court will
be called upon to determine the legality
of the commitment. Mr. Collins holds that
the presence of the word "intending" in
stead of "tending" makes the commit
ment fatally defective, and a decision of
the Supreme Court on this point will be
of great value to Howe as well as the rest
of the commonwealth.
TO TRY TO BEAT STRECKER.
Noted Marksmen Will Compete for
Rifle Honors.
The defeat of F. E. Mason by Adolph
Strecker, "the Post-street Sycamore." In
their recent contest at the Schuetzen Park
ranges seems to have stirred up a hor
net.-' nest in the riflemen's world. Three
famous marksmen are after the winner's
laurels with a vengeance, and declare that
a week from next Thursday Strecker may
travel to Shell Mound to the tune of
"Yankee Doodle," but will return to
"Chevy Chase."
The match between Mason and the
Post-street champion was to determine
who was to be. regarded as the 150 shot
champion of the California Schuetzen
Club and incidentally the relative merits
of the different patterns of rifles used.
The winner used the older style rifle and
scored 3265 points. Mason's score being
3239 points. , _ j ,_ â _
The loser was evidently satisfied both
as regards St-recker's superior ability as
a marksman and the style of gun he
championed: but there are others who
are not. It was finally decided that
Strecker should not be permitted so easy
a victory. Accordingly the best three
' shots of the organization (barring the
"Sycamore" himself) were selected at
Schuetzen Park last Sunday to make an
attempt to dethrone him. They are John
Utschig Sr , F: P. Schuster and D. B.
Faktor.
Their challenge has been issued and ac
cepted, and on Thursday, the 19th Inst.,
will occur the event which now is almost
the sole topic of conversation In shooting
circles. It will be a sweepstakes contest,
' and each man will shoot 100 times. While
It is hoped that at least one of the trio
! will succeed In lowering Strecker's colors,
I the point of relative superiority concern
ing the different types of gun is also to
|be determined. In order to make it a fair
! trial, Utschig and Schuster will shoot
1 with the later pattern of stun and Faktor
| will use a gun similar to Strecker's.

ALL DRANK TEA POURED
BY IMITATION JAPANESE
NOVEL ENTERTAINMENT GIVEN
AT THE Y. M. C. A.
Volunteer League of the Association
Celebrated Its First Anniversary
in an Original Manner.
The Volunteer League of the Young
Men's Christian Association, assisted by
the various church young people's socie
ties, gave a Japanese tea and reception
In the auditorium and parlors of the as
sociation last night In celebration of the
league's first anniversary. The decora
tions were in keeping with the occasion,
the parlors being transformed by the pro
fusion of Japanese flags, screens and bric
a-brac, while dainty tea tables, fully
equipped for the service of the seductive
beverage, were arranged in a number of
booths and presided over by scores of
pretty young women dressed In flowing
costumes suggestive of the empire of the
Mikado.
The entertainment opened with a lit
erary and musical programme in the audi
torium, which was very pleasingly ren
dered, as follows:
"Samisen," P. Toyosawa; "The Anchor's
Weighed" (Braham). Mr. Mitchell; "Serenade"
(Victor Herbert). San Francisco Conservatory
Mandolin Club; reading, "Widow Bellamey's
Experience in a New York Hotel," Mips Ja
cobs; "Ouvrey" (Dessauer), Misa Merry hew;
(a) Shlkino Itako OdOrl." (b) "Megura Hi
Odorl." Sada Hasriwara; "A Night In Venice"
(Lucanconl), Miss Merryhew .'in.i Mr. Mitchell;
"Kekkonshiki" (Japanese wedding ceremony),
Japanese young people.
The reception in the parlors which fol
lowed the' entertainment proper was in
charge of a reception committee, of which
C. A. Mavdwell was chairman and E. A.
Bigger staff secretary. The correctness
of the decorations was largely due to the
active assistance rendered by the mem
bers of the Japanese Young Men's Chris
tian Association, a number of whom also
contributed to the entertainment.
The affair was given for the double pur
pose of celebrating the anniversary of the
league and to raise funds for the spread
of the association work in Japan. The
officers of -the league, which is ma healthy
condition, are: T. H. NVayland. president,
and Alexander Gardiner, secretary and
treasurer,

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 11. -There were smart de
clines in the specialties to-day. but the reces
sions In the railways were fractional. It was
a holiday on the Continent, and the death of
an English banker restricted some of the ar- i
bitrage business, hut London took about thirty .
Fhares of the internationals stocks. Sterling
exchange was easier, nd money ranged from j
3 to 4 on call, with the last loan at the smaller
figure. One reason for this is that a fair!-. large
volume of money is moving card New York
from the interior. The crop report was at first
interpreted as more favorable than expected,
but subsequently the hears used the "decrease
in acreage" to depress the granger stocks,
which had earlier displayed considerable |
Ftrength. Rurlingtejn's net loss of over a point
was the largest in this group. The understand
ing that the Ford franchise tax bill would be
come a law was fall used against local
shares, the traction shares I -wing net losses
ranging from one to four points, the greatest
loss being in Metropolitan, in which it was
said part of a heavy line of shares had been
liquidated. The veto by the Mayor of the
Rapid Transit bill failed to sustain Manhattan
Covering left these stocks above the worst
and other shares sympathetically rallied slight
ly in the afternoon.
The market closed Irregular. Among the i
weak spots were sugar. International Paper !
preterreei and United States Leather preferred, I
while Tennessee Coal and Iron retained over ;
a point of its advance. Recessions were noted
ialso in tho iron and steel stocks. The reaction
in to-day's market was deemed natural by I
some interests in view of the violent recovery '
yesterday, which canceled a large part of the !
reputed short interests in the market. Specu
lation took a decided vim and the marked '
periods of stagnation were dissipated at
intervals, when trades were made. Realiza
tions furnish.?d the chi.^f impetus to the retro
grade move, and occasionally periods of
strength were attributal t>> coverln. by the
traders at a favorable level American To
bacco was dealt In on the stock dividend of 100
per cent and closed at 102%, compared wlln !

market showed firmness on moderate dealings

THE OUTLOOK FOR CANNED FRUITS.
NEW YORK. May 11.-The Journal of Com
merce says: Trade here has been waiting for
the opening prices on California canned fruits
for a week or ten days, but as far as can be
learned none of the packers has put out prices,
although it is understood that some confidential
prices to large buyers have been made at an
advance of 10 to 12% per cent over the opening
figures last year.
No brands are mentioned, but we understand
that several of the local representatives of
prominent packers have issued the following
I quotations privately to a few or the larger
I buyers on extra three-pound standards, viz. â¢
j $2 25 on sliced or peeled apricots. $2 7. on halves
! or sliced lemon cling peaches. $2 45 on yellow
j free peaches, $2 70 on Bartlett pears, $2 10 on
; plums of all varieties, $3 05 on Royal Anne
! and $2 65 on black cherries, all f. o. b. Call
i fornia.
The hesitancy of packers on the coast to
' make prices Is said to be due to the uncer
j tainty felt by them as to the possibility of

obtaining sufficient stocks of green fruit, be
cause of the prospect of a large demand from â 
Eastern markets this season for California |
fresh fruit, owing to reported failure of East- |
crn crops. There was at last mail advices
from the coast an active demand for green !
fruits from the Eastern trade, apricots, cher
ries and Bartlett pears being in particularly
good request, and growers were indifferent to
requests for supplies from both canners and
driers, as from present Indications they believe
that the Eastern trade will require at least
10,000 cars of green fruits this year, and with ;
better facilities offered by railroads for the
shipment of fruit fresh in refrigerator cars, j
growers. It is understood, will give their first |
attention to the marketing of the larger part of |
their crop In that way.
According to our advices, growers are mak
ing every effort to secure orders for green fruits
for the East for shipments before July 10 In
order to get the trade in these markets. There
.fore, instead of waiting for consignments of
fresh fruits to be made shippers, we learn, are
buying freely on a cash basis for shipment to
Eastern markets, feeling confident that all they
send forward will be absorbed in New York.

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEATâ The Government report, showing a
i percentage of over 76, instead of about 70. as
I expected, depressed the Chicago market from
72 to 69%. This effectually overcame the bullish
I reports of Hessian fly in Ohio and the plowing
up of 51 per cent of the Illinois acreage, the
remainder standing only at 52. In addition 50
per cent of Kansas and Nebraska was reported
plowed up. The bulls turned bears and raided^
the market The demand on shipping account
was poor.
This market declined in sympathy with Chi

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
The Hay situation Is' getting Interesting
again. The crop of Los Angeles County Is a
failure and warehousemen at Hollister and
Tres Pinos reported a partial failure In those
sections yesterday. If Los Angeles has to come
j north for Hay this year It will make a great
I difference with the market, but if Texas and
I Arizona supply her wants the failure will have
no effect whatever. In view of the very low
j prices now ruling a large acreage will be cut
; for grain this year, and in this event the pro
duction of Hay will tie much smaller than has
been expected up to this date. The situation
is complicated and dealers do not know ex
actly where they stand in reference to the
coming crop.
The market was quieter yesterday, as re
ceipts were larger again, but prices showed no
change.

DECIDUOUS AND CITRUS FRUITS.
Receipts were 1470 boxes Cherries and 673
chests Strawberries. '
The situation in Cherries remajns about the
same, though prices are slightly off. The re
ceipts have daily grown smaller for several
days, but the high prices keep the market from
cleaning up. so the stock is increasing in spite
of the diminishing receipts. A good many
black were shipped to Portland and Victoria
yesterday, but white were not wanted for this
business and free supplies were left on hand
at the close.
Berries of the different kinds are coming
in more freely, as will be seen by the quotations
below.

DRIED FRUITS. NETS AND RAISINS.
New- York mall advices say of Prunes:
"Prunes continue steady, though buyers are
few and mail orders from consumers are not
large, though the aggregate is sufficient to
maintain prices at about the previous level.
The total supply available for distribution is
so small that with any consuming demand at
all prices must remain firm or advance. Some, :
further export demand from Germany is ex- I
pected, supplies in that country being very !
low and the embargo on American dried fruits !
removed. How serious the drop may be remains ;
to be determined, but it Is certain that It is '
large. The reports have a strengthening in- '
fluence on the market, and, it is thought, mas
cause an advance."

Nome, the newly discovered diggings. At
the latter place It will be easy enough to
land, but there will be no getting the
boats back again through the surf, so the
chances are that the hulk of the business
with Cape Nome will be done through
Golovln Bay.
The Townsend was formerly the steam
whaler Alliance. She was laid up in Oak
land Creek for years, but last year she
was taken out of retirement and practi
cally rebuilt. She was then named the
Townsend and has since been running be
tween San Francisco and Coqullle River
In the lumber trade. Yesterday Mr. Lane
and a party of friends took a trip outside
the heads on the steamer and her new
owner whs very much pleased with her.
The Townsend will sail for her new field
of labor about the beginning of next
month.
The bark Alaska and the barken tines
Jane A. Falkenburg and Catherine Sud
den are also being got ready for a trip
to the gold fields. The Alaska came out
of Oakland Creek yesterday and went to
the California drydock. She. will he thor
oughly overhauled and sail about May
2"). She will carry passengers and freight
principally for Kotzebue Sound, but also
for Cape Nome, Golovln Bay and Port
Clarence. The Catherine Sudden arrived
from Grays Harbor yesterday and as soon
as she has discharged she will be got
ready for the far north. The Jane A.
Falkenberg is to be brought out of Oak
land Creek and she also will join the
procession.
The big- transportation companies do not
expect any rush until after the return of
the first steamer from St. Michael. They
fire satisfied that the new fields are rich
and very extensive, but as Louis Sloss
said yesterday afternoon. "The general
public will not believe it until they have
had some proof." The steamer Bertha
will leave here June G nd on her return
trip from St. Michael she will probably
bring down a number of miners laden with
nuggets. At St. Michael the Bertha will
connect with the Alaska Commercial
Company's steamer Sadie, bound for Cape
Nome. Golovln Hay and Port Clarence. As
soon as the Yukon River opens a number
of the stern-wheel fleet of steamers will
be put on the route, as an exodus from
Dawson Is. expected. -U.-:

There was some pretty loud talking in
the engine-rooms of the transports a
couple of days ago, and some of it Is
going on still." Each vessel carries seven
engineers. There were the chief and the
first, second and third assistants, ail of
whom had to be licensed officers. Then
there were the fourth, fifth and sixth as
sistants, who ranked W junior engineers
but were not required to hold a certifi
cate. Now the order has gone forth and
all the "juniors" must pass their exami
nation and tret their papers before they
can go to sea as fourth, fifth or sixth en
gineer. Very few of the young men have
been long enough at sea to entitle them
to a certificate, and in consequence new
men will replace them on the transports.
The freight steamer Belgian King ar
rived from Honolulu last Wednesday
night and docked at Lombard-street
wharf. Her cargo for this port will be
all discharged to-day, when she will sail
for San Diego. This Is the Belgian King's
second visit to the oast, and when she
was last in San Diego a full description
of the vessel and captain was published
in The Call. â x ,
The steamer Australia took away a

They wen two women, who said they
wished to reach a soldier brother who is
in the Islands. When they were discovered
Captain Houdlette signaled the pilot boat
Lady Mine and put them aboard. Cap

at Meiggs wharf. The women refused
positively to give their names.

According to Richard K. Fox's sporting

Fltzsimrr.ons Is awfully jealous of Corbett's
sueceps a.s a tavern keeper, and lias decided
to bark in the same kind of an enterprise.
The flittering exterior of his rival's thirst
alleviating institution is an eyesore to the

listic, etiquette- would not permit him to enter
the door). lb- has seenâ from the outsideâ the

coin and the musical rustle of the "long
grÂ«-en" as It was passed into the dexterous maw
of the Immaculately attired dispenser of liquid
Joy, and his soul has been stirred with envy.
Fltz wants to emulate his rival, and his
mind's <â >â¢â  has pictured the Interior of a
more gorgeously equipped "winery" in which
to receive his friends and admirers. "The

Work to Be Done at Fort Baker.
Plan to Put Old Fort Scott
to Practical Use by Im
provements.
Few people aside from those directly
connected with the work are aware that
San Francisco is to-day the second best
fortified harbor in the United States. In-
deed It is doubtful If there are a half
dozen harbors in the world so invulner
able to a hostile fleet as Is the Golden
Gate.
New York harbor has more guns mount
ed than there are here, but Xew York is
much more extensive and difficult to
properly fortify than this. For ten years
the building of modern fortifications has
been going on here, and before the year
is ended it is expected that the last of
the . modern high-power breech-loading
rifles and mortars contemplated in the
plan of defense, for this side of tho en
trance at least, will be in position ready
to repel invasion. The work on the Ma
rin shore at Fort Baker may not be com
pleted for another twelve or twenty-four
months. -
The work under way now Is the mount
ing of the second battery of sixteen mor
tars on the bluffs above and back of old
Fort Winfield Scott Eight of the huge
pieces of ordnance are already in posi
tion and the others are all in the city and
are being rapidly mounted. Every day or
bo one of these pieces is hauled from
the railroad yards to the reservation,
where It Is quickly placed on its carriage
by the forces of the Third Artillery.
These mortars are considerably larger
and more destructive than the battery of
sixteen that was mounted about three
years ago. The new mortars are 12-lnch
steel, breech-loading weapons, throwing
a shell weighing 1000 pounds, while the
others carry. -pound shells. . Â£*-'*J
In addition to the mortars a 12-Inch
fie and disappearing carriage of the
newest model are ready for shipment
from thej East, if they are 'not already on
the way. There is still another gun and
carriage of the same size and type near
ing completion, and as soon as they are
In position the 12-inch battery at Fort
Point will be completed.
An eight-inch rifle and carriage is about
ready for shipment from the East, which
is intended for what is called the ceme
tery battery that is being placed in the
old cemetery purchased by the Govern
ment for the purpose a few years ago.
Another eight-Inch gun and carriage . is
in course of construction, and as soon as
they are in place the cemetery battery
will be completed, and. In fact, the en
tire fortifications as 'far as planned for
this side will be in position.
At Fort Baker two more twelve-inch
rifles and disappearing carriages already
ordered are necessary to complete the
water battery that is being constructed
on Gravelly Beach, almost on a level with
the sea, between Point Bonita and Fort
Baker proper. It is not generally known
that the guns mounted on the bluff at
Fort Baker form the most elevated for
tifications in the world, being at a greater
height above the sea than even the guns
at Gibraltar. '-,'. â ."'â¢â 
The fortifications at Fort Baker as
planned at present will be completed with
the placing of a battery of sixteen 12-inch
mortars. But no steps have been taken
on this part of the work yet.
Some timeâ but not for some years prob
ablyâthe old brick fort, or a portion of
it, that stands just at the entrance to the
Golden Gate will be put ta practical use.
Array engineers have prepared plans and
submitted a report to the War Depart
ment recommending that the top story of
the fort be removed, the. brick and ma
sonry walls reinforced with steel plates
and a battery of rapid-fire guns, mounted
in heavily armored steel turrets, be
placed on top of the structure in such a
position that they would fairly rain metal
upon any ship that might possibly run
the gauntlet of the heavier guns and at
tempt tec force her way through the chan
nel This plan .also contemplates using
part of the fort for a torpedo station,
from which mines across the channel and
the approaches to the Gate would be op
erated Congress, however, must provide
for this work before anything can be
Recruits for the two new heavy bat
teries of the Third Artillery are coming
in rapidly. Battery N is being organized
at Angel Island and Battery O at the
Presidio. Under the reorganization law
every artillery regiment is entitled to

LOST HER JEWELS.
An Occidental Hotel Guest Plucked
of Valuable Diamonds.
Mrs. C. D. Hazzard of Minneapolis, who
has been a guest at the Occidental for
some weeks past, reported to the man
agement yesterday morning that dia
monds and other jewels to the value of
several hundred dollars were missing
from her rooms.
With her daughter Mrs. Hazzard lias
been stopping at the Occidental while her
new home in Belvedere was building. On
Wednesday they moved across the bay,
and late that night Mrs. Hazzard missed
her gems. She remembered having left
them In an upper drawer of her bureau
at the hotel, and yesterday morning hur
ried across to this city to get them.
They were gone, however, and there
was no clew to their whereabouts except
in the abrupt leavetaklng of one of the
chambermaids. Investigation, however,
developed that the chambermaid had left
before the diamonds were taken. Mrs.
Hazzard has employed detectives to trace
her Jewels, and the hotel management Is
doing its utmost in her assistance.

HAD NOT DRAWN HIS
PAY FOR FIVE YEARS
Â© F. M. COKE, the chief paymaster of the department, had Â©
Q ff * an experience yesterday that for a brief space of time completely Q
w I _ robbed him of his usual composure and presence of mind. As the w
Â© disburser of the funds with which the Government operates its army, Â©
Â© Colonel Coxe was temporarily threatened with a run on the bank by Â©
_ a creditor' whose existence had been forgotten In the daily routine q
of the branch of the service over which. the colonel exercises control. This
Â© creditor, whose faith in Uncle Sam's ability and willingness to pay caused Â©
Â© him to credit the Government for nearly five years, is an old army sergeant Â©
q named Otis V. Estes. He was honorably discharged from the Eighth In- Â©
fantry on account of age after a life spent in the service. In accordance rt
Â© with the law in such a case Estes was entitled to $30 a month during the
Â© remainder of his natural life." He was discharged from the service about Â©
_ the latter part of 1893, and for a few months he drew his allowance regu- Â©
** larly; then he decided that he would make a trip around the world, so q
Q off he started and the paymaster's department heard nothing more from
Â© Sergeant Estes. It was thought that he was dead and his existence was Â©
ft forgotten. Â©
Â° A few months ago Sergeant Estes, having tired of globe trotting and hap- Â©
O pening by chance to be in Honolulu, called on the paymaster there just to. _
Â© see how his account stood and to get a little pin money. He had his pa- Â®
ft pers with him and everything was correct, and after the paymaster had Â©
** figured for a while he found that the old soldier was entitled to about $1800 Â©
O of Uncle Sam's gold coin. His papers showed that Estes last drew pay on __
Â© August 31, 1894. The paymaster became suspicious. He had never heard of w
q such a case before. He had always been bothered with men and officers Â©
w who would like to draw their pay before It was due, but here was a sol- Q
O dier who had not drawn it for nearly five years. He sent the papers here q
Â© to Colonel Coxe, who verified them at army headquarters in Washington, n
rt and they were found to be correct. Â©

URGENT INVITATIONS
TO ADMIRAL DEWEY
CITIZENS REQUEST HIM TO
VISIT SAN FRANCISCO.
Secretary Long Asked to Change the
Route From the Suez Canal to
the Pacificâ of Ona
Voice.
Although the dispatches from the East
announce that Admiral Dewey will make
the return trip straight to New York via
the Suex canal, still the patriotic citi
zens of this coast have not given up the
Idea that the plans may be modified so
that the opportunity will be presented to
give the hero of Manila an ovation in this
city. At several meetings recently resolu
tions were passed looking to this end, and
foremost among the business bodies was
the local Chamber of Commerce. Yester
day Secretary Scott forwarded to the ad
miral the following urgent invitation to
visit San Francisco on his return:
Admiral George Dewey, U. S. N., Flagship
Olympia, Philippine Islandsâ Sir: Realizing
the great importance of your brilliant achieve
ments, especially to us of the Pacific States,
and desiring to join with our fellow citizens In
welcoming you and your good ship Olympla,
which we all feel is a child of our coast,
both In name and construction, we earnestly
hope that you will favor us, when it may
be consistent with your official duties to return
to an appreciative country, by coming over
the ocean, rendered safe to our commerce by
your signal victory, and bringing back your
ship to the place of her birth.
Should you decide, we respectfully request
that you will grant to the Chamber of Com
merce of San Francisco the honor of tender
ing you a public reception when In our city.
With the highest regard for your good health
and welfare, we beg to subscribe ourselves,
sir, Your Obedient Servants.
To this was added this dispatch from a
kindred organization in the southern part
of til" State: <
SANTA BARBARA. Cal., May 11. 1599.
Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco: We
most heartily join you in your efforts to in
duce Admiral Dewey to return home via San
Francis
Santa Barbara Chamber of Commerce.
Supplemental to this invitation a letter
was sent to the Secretary of the Navy re
questing the department to change the
programme for Dewey's return, which
reads:
Hon. John D. Long, Secretary of the Navy,
Washington, D. C. : As we understand Ad
miral Dewey Is about to return from Manila,
; and claiming with the rest of the citizens of
' this coast a particular and special concern
in his great victory and ship, the Olympia, we
' earnestly hope that you may find It consistent
with the best Interests of your department to
\ have him come back with his flagship by way
of our city.

BARRED FILIPINOS.
Ten Would-Be Actors Refused a
Landing by the Immigration
Commissioners.
The special board of inquiry met in
Commissioner North's office yesterday
morning to consider the case of ten Fili
pino immigrants of both sexes on their
way to New York to take part in the rep
resentation of a Philippine village as ac
tors. It appeared from the statements
made by the applicants that they had
been engaged in their native country as
cooks and servants, but that they had
occasionally sung Spanish songs between
cigarette whiffs at cockfights, receiving
cigars and drinks as their reward.
As they produced no evidence to show
that they had ever been pelted with rot
ten eggs the board of inquiry was unani
mously of the opinion that they were not
even snide actors, and decided that they
were contract laborers and therefore not
entitled to land.
Baldwin Must Obey.
The effort of E. J. Baldwin to restrain
the Supervisors from Interfering with his
hotel fence has availed him not. The
matter was heard by Judge Troutt yester
day morning, and after a brief hearing
the court refused to grant an injunction
against the board as prayed, and the mat
ter was left ln the hands of the Superin
tendent of Streets. John B. Gartland, who
represented the Superintendent of Streets,
said that he was willing to grant Mr.
Baldwin twenty-four hours in which to
put the fence back on the line with his
property. If this Is not done the fence
will be removed in accordance with the
order recently passed by the Supervisors.

City Engineer Clement Will Need the
Votes in the Disputed Pre
cinct in Order to Hold
His Seat.
Â«
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 11.
The politicians who hope to unseat City
Engineer Clement are deriving small sat
isfaction from the progress of the con
test now being conducted by Judge Hall.
The two wards, the Fourth and Sixth, in
which Mr. Miller's friends expected to
make great gains, have been completed
and show no practical difference from the j
official figures.
In the complaint filed by Mr. Miller It
was alleged that in the Fourth Ward
there should have been a difference of
eighty-five votes from the official returns
in favor of Miller. The contestant al
leged that thirty-live votes marked for
Miller had been counted for Clement: that
thirty-six votes were counted for Clem
ent that should have been for another
candidate, and that fourteen votes were
given Clement that should have been
thrown out.
In the Sixth Ward, where all the ma
chine political work Is generally sup
posed to be done, according to the con
testant. Miller should have been bene
fited ITtl votes, he claiming that the elec
tion officers had willfully juggled with the
counting in favor of Clement.
These two wards were counted with the
exception of one precinct In the Sixth,
and no difference was shown from the :
official figures. About a score of ballots
are held in reserve, owing to objections
made by either side, but there is nothing
to justify an expectation that the con- .
test will bring forth any changes such as
were alleged in the complaint.
In one precinct of the Sixth ward sixty
five ballots had evidently been marked by
a pencil. These were thrown out tem
porarily for the officers to appear and _-
plain. . , _
The progress of the recount In th- Sec
ond Ward showed no material change,
and it is probable hat it will be aban- '
doned before the whole city has been re- j
counted.

MURDER WAS INTENDED.
Remarkable Discovery of a Bullet in
a Victim of the Thalia Sa-
loon Fracas.
OAKLAND, May 11.â A discovery was
made to-day that establishes beyond ail
question the fact that the assault upon
"Covey" Randlett at the notorious Thalia
saloon on the county road about two
weeks ago was prompted by a murderous
intent. After the drunken brawl at the
Thalia, in which furniture and windows
were smashed and much blood spilled,
Randlett was treated at the Receiving
Hospital for an ugly gash on the head,
which appeared to have be en made by
blows from a revolver. Randlett was
very reticent all the while, and though It
was known that a pistol had been used
he declined to give any details.
Since then 1 Â»r. Howe has been attending
Bandlett, and to-day the physician dis
covered a hard lump on the back of his
patient's skull. An Incision was promptly
made and a flattened forty-four-caliber
bullet extracted. When confronted with
the missile Bandlett finally admitted
that he had been shot at the time of the
row. His escape had be. ii miraculous,
for the shot had been delivered straight
from the back, but instead of penetrating
the skull it flattened against the bone.
The discovery will be taken into account
by the Supervisors in scrutinizing the af
fairs of the immoral roadside houses and
saloons, and will be given consideration
in granting licenses in the future.
SENIOR BALL.
Members of the University Graduat
ing Class Hold Their Last
Social Function.
BERKELEY, May Commencement
week at the University of California was
ushered In by the senior ball held to
night. The ball is an annual affair given
by the members of the graduating class
and is always the last social function be-
fore the close of the college term. This
year it was held In Harmon gymnasium
upon the university campus. The work
of the committee on decorations left the
building very prettily arranged for the
occasion. Long hangings of blue and
gold, meeting at a point In the center of
the room, with a dash here and there of
red among the palms and greens, gave
the principal (feet. The limited number
of invitations made the hall less crowded
than usual, but the affair was. none the
less successful.
Following is a list of the committees in
charge:
Floor managerâ William H. Houston.
Committee on arrangementsâ Charles
M. Mannon, chairman; Harriet Thane,
Miss Alice Rising, Miss Louise J. 'lolling
and Ernest Denfcke.

port further shows the population of i
Berkeley to be 13,188, a gain of 874 over!
last year. j
PROFESSIONAL BEGGARS.
Paul Jenkins and his wife Annie are
professional beggars. Their mode of ope
rations Is for Annie to go Into saloons in
the "tenderloin" district and solicit alms
for a mythical starving family. She was
successful in getting, as a rule, a lot of
money, which he handed to her husband,
who remained outside.
They were arrested Wednesday night
by Policeman Sylvester, and when they
appeared before Judge Mogan yesterday
he at once recognized her as the woman
whose plea for her starving family on
two occasions had the effect of making
him give her some silver. When ques
tioned by the Judge , both unblushingly
denied ever having visited any saloon or
having seen the Judge before. This was
too much for the Judge and he sent them
to the County Jail for six months each.
Mrs. Dyas Gets Judgment.

LATEST FAD.

' Teams Will Contest for Honors Sat
urday on the Lawns Surround
ing the Home of _I/v
George Mastick.
#
ALAMEDA, May 11.â Basket ball is the
latest fad of Alameda society. Although
there has never been a game of real Im
portance played here, the only topic of
conversation in the upper circles is the
contest to take place Saturday afternoon
on the lawn of Mrs. George 11. Mastick'
premises between teams representing the
High School and the Longfellow School.
The affair is under the auspices of tho
Alameda Women' s Charitable Associa
tion, and the proceeds will go to enrich
the treasury of that worthy organization.
Mrs. Mastick, who is one of the leading
spirits of the association, has made it a
practice to give her home over one day '
in .very year to some entertainment or i
social function, the proceeds of which
might assist the society In carrying on I
its work of charity. Last year it was
a "pink tea," which proved to be one of
the social features of the season. This j
year it Is to be basket ball, and from the
interest taken in the approaching game
icy the swell set there is iittle doubt that
the contest will be a brilliant society af
lair.
The teams will be composed of the fol
lowing young ladies:^
Alameda High Schoolâ Miss Zona Leon
ard (captain), center; Miss Vida McKean,
right center; Miss lima Slder, left cen
ter; Miss Ruth Thompson, goalman; Miss
Ora tiealey, right goal; Miss Kathleen
Lehnahan, left goal; Miss Doretha Bowen,
guard; Miss Edna Rue, right guard; Miss
Daisy Crawford, left guard; Miss Edith
Chipchase, Miss Bertha Crawford, Miss
Sadie Innes, Miss Gertrude Linderman,
substitutes.
Longfellow Schoolâ Miss Alice Edwards,
center; Miss Clara Houston, right center;
Miss Elsie Shreve, left center; Miss Wini
fred Mastick (captain), goalman; Miss
Emma Grass, right goal; Miss Eva
Koesch, left goal; Miss Ada Cambridge,
guard; Miss Gretchen Suennen, right
guard; Miss Minna Abraham, left guard;
Miss Bessie Lank tree, substitute.
The colors of the High School will be
white and gold. The team will wear uni
forms of dark green. Red will be the color
of the Longfeilows. Their uniforms will
be of the same shade. The teams have
been practicing most zealously for the
past six weeks, and are said to put up as
line a game as can be played. The Long
fellows have been coached by Miss Mac-
Go wan, and the lady feels confident that
her sprightly players will get away with
the more experienced basket baillsts of
the High School. Miss Mattie Leonard is
coaching the latter team, and she is
equally confident that her aggregation is
invincible.
The officials for the game will be Miss
Mattie Leonard, referee; Miss Ray Ja
cobs and Miss MacGowan, umpires; Miss
Maryan Leonard, scorer; Miss Bessie
Johnson, timekeeper.
As the proceeds of the game will go to
a deserving charitable society there is
little question that the Mastick grounds
will be crowded Saturday.
HE WANTS" HIS SHARE.
Edward H. Clark Sues His Family
for an Accounting and Damages.
Suit was filed yesterday by Edward H. i
Clark against his mother, Charlotte F.
1 Clark; his sister, Charlotte H. Clark; his
brother, Harold Clark, and Edith A. E.
and Charles G. Lyman to recover posses
; sion of one-eighth of the estate of his de
ceased father, Jeremiah Clark, and $50,000
damages for the detention thereof by the
\ defendants. In his complaint the plain- j
! tiff alleges that after the death of his
parent the entire estate was consolidated '.
I by the heirs that it might be more eas- ;
j ily handled, Since that time, he avers, '
his mother has realized $55,000 profits from
the estate and has made $250,000 In real
estate Investments, none of which has
been shared with him as an heir to the
estate. He asks Jthat the court decree
that an accounting he- had between him
and the defendants and that he be given
j his share of the profits, that the estate
' he partitioned as far as he is concerned
that he may be placed in possession of
his share, and for damages in the sum
of $60,000 for the refusal of the defend
ants to account to him regarding the
profits of the estate and paying to him
his share according to his interest in the
; estate, as provided in the agreement at
the time of the consolidation of the in
terests of the various heirs of the estate.
AN ARTIST HONORED.
Pictures Painted by Charles Dickman
Accepted for the Paris Salon.
In a letter from Venice, received yester
day by W. G. Stafford, mention is made
of the acceptance for exhibition in the
Paris Salon of two pictures painted by
Charles J. Dickman. One of the pictures
is a portrait of Mrs. Dickman, and the
other a sunset scene In Brittany. Mr.
Dickman's success affords pleasure to his
many friends in this city. It Is remarked
that he was formerly a pupil in the
School of Design of the San Francisco
Art Association, where he displayed so
much talent in the art of painting that
his admirers advised him to study in
France, Germany and Italy. Mr. Dick
man has a commission to paint a picture
for the Bohemian Club. He left this city
| In the summer of 1597 to pursue his stud
ies abroad, and the Owl at the club Is
j hooting for his return.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 11.
While the local Endeavorers have been
busily engaged ln planning for the proper
entertainment of the twelfth annual con
vention of the California Christian En
' deavor Union, those not so engaged have
been at work planning for the business to
be transacted during the meeting.
Of course, the most Important thing is
the selection of the new officers. These in
clude a president, three vice presidents,
general secretary, treasurer and seven
superintendents of departments. There
are never any candidates for these offi
cers nor electioneering in the general
sense of the term. At the same time,
some people are generally looked upon as
leaders who will be accorded honors, but
the selection of a president is often hard j
to make. The position requires tact, en
ergy, time and, most of all, spirituality
without self-importance.
This year it is generally conceded that
the president should come from the Meth- |
odist or Christian denomination and that
he should hail from the Sacramento or I
San Joaquin Valley. This will be hard to
de. and it may go to San Francisco. San !
Jose Is barred, it having had three presi- !
dents in six years. In case neither of the :
denominations mentioned furnishes a man
General Secretary Francis \V. Reld of
Clayton, Contra Costa County, will be
forced into the position against his will.
This will cause a vacancy in the secre- '
tary's office that would not otherwise
occur, for Mr. Keid will be re-elected If ]
not promoted. His excellent work during ;
the three years of his incumbency has
placed the State union above the average.
The three vice -residents will be select
ee! from the portions of the State not
represented by the other two offices. The !
treasurer will be near the president.
The departments will not be materially
changed. Miss Belle P. Nasan of San
Diego will undoubtedly be given the junior
and intermediate work that she has al
ways had. Miss Mindora L. Berry of
Fresno, who resigned the missionary su
perintendency last year, owing to 111
--health, will probably be re-elected with
out opposition. E. C. Gilbert of San
Francisco will be continued In the work
he originated among the streetcar and
railway nun and traveling salesmen. Rev.
E. B. Haves, a past president, Is strongly
recommended for the Quiet Hour depart
ment while the work among sailors will
go to either Giles Kellogg or M. C. Furner
of San Diego. The Good Literature and
Press and Tenth Legion departments are
yet unprepared for.
The constitution, which has been In use
twelve years, will be up for amendment.
The committee on revision has prepared
an entirely new one, which is said to
contain some radical changes and may
prove to be troublesome.
The place of meeting is always an in
teresting affair. Fresno, which had the
convention in 1893, Sacramento, of 159.5
fame- and Stockton are the principal
places seeking it for 1900. The Slough
City seems to be in the lead, and when
Its delegates arrive and begin distribut
ing souvenir sacks of flour it will look
hard for the other cities.
The matter of a delegate to the Inter
national Convention at Detroit in July
has not been discussed, but strong oppo
sition to this expense of ST.". or $100 devel
oped at Los Angeles last year, and if
any attempt is made this year to elect
! a State delegate there will be a fight that
; will go into history. The opposition Is
I strong to this move.
AFTER STRAW BONDSMEN.
The Grand Jury Investigating Illicit
Practices in Police Courts.
Yesterday's session of the Grand Jury
was devoted to an examination of wit
nesses in the matter of the issuance of a
straw Bond for the release of the negro.
Harry Wilson. Ex-Deputy Sheriff Ed
Riley, who was named as one of the sure
ties on the worthless bond, was examined,
but denied any complicity in the affair.
He declared that he did not see Police
Court Clerk Kelly on the night that the
bond was accepted, and as proof of his
assertion he asked that the jury call a
man by the name of Hogan. Hogan
claimed that he was with Riley on tho
night In question and that Riley did not
sign a bond and did not meet Kelly. Ex-
Sheriff Whelan testified that Riley's char
acter during the time he was in the Sher
iff's office was neither good nor bad.
A subpena had been issued for Attorney
J. N. E. Wilson, but he failed to put in
an appearance. The fact that he failed
to obey the summons was made the sub
ject of considerable comment. Thomas S.
Cosgrove, the other surety on the Wilson
bond, has not yet been located by the
police.
WON HIS PROMOTION.
Colonel Liscum Will Command the
Ninth to Manila.
Colonel Emerson H. Liscum, assigned
to the command of the Ninth Infantry,
now in the Philippines, arrived last even
ing from Washington, and registered at
the Palace. He will proceed to Manila on
one of the transports soon to leave.
The Ninth is to be Colonel Liscum's
first regiment. He won his colonelcy by
his gallant service In Cuba, where he
led the Twenty-fourth Infantry, now at
the Presidio, in the charge at San Juan
Ridge. Although at that time a lieutenant
colonel, he was in command of his regi
ment, and later was placed in command
of the Third Brigade of the Fifth Army
Corps. He was severely wounded during
the fighting at San Juan, but managed
to escape the fevers and was ln command
again before the fun was over.
Colonel Liscum will report to General
Shafter to-day for assignment to his
transport.

Places Where Keno Was Played Will

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 11.
Now the little locks on the Inside of the
private room doors in saloons and restau
rants have met with a combination of the
City Council, and they must go. These
little locks, according to investigations
made by several members of the Council,
who decline to have their names made
public, are closely allied to the side door
entrances and other abominations that
Oakland Is anxious to be rid of.
At a meeting of the License Committee
this subject was brought up and the Li
cense Collector and the Police Department
were notified to make an Inspection of all
the doors of private rooms in restaurants
and report to the committee. All places
having these little locks will be refused
a license until such locks are-removed.
A wholesome fear has taken possession
of certain saloon keepers owing to state
ments almost amounting to declarations
of intention made by the Mayor and oth
ers regarding their licenses. These re
marks have been made evidently for a
purpose, and the particular statement
causing anxiety is that no saloon which
permitted boys to play keno within it dur
ing the recent keno excitement will be
regranted a license. Two or three very
prosperous saloons come under this ban,
and several Councllmen have expressed
themselves as being opposed to allowing
them to continue business. One of these j
Is on Twelfth street, and Its proprietor
will have a hard battle on his hands when
his license expires.
The question of permitting bicycles on
sidewalks has been deferred for a few
days until the Council can pass upon still
another ordinance. This new measure re
quires cyclists who ride on the sidewalk
to carry a bell, to dismount when meeting
passengers, to provide their wheels with
brakes and to pay $10 if arrested and con
victed for violating it. This was recom
mended to the Council by the committee,
and as Mayor Snow has stated that he
will not approve any ordinance whose
terms differ materially from this one It
will likely become a law.

A COPPER BOOM.
C. D. Van Duzer Says One Has Struck
Golconda, Nev.
C. D. Van Duzer, District Attorney of
Humboldt County, Nev., and editor of the
Golconda News, is a guest at the Palace.
Mr. Van Duzer is in the city for the pur
pose of interesting capital in some valua
ble copper properties in Golconda, and
states that his section is now enjoying a
copper boom of no small dimensions.
"The recent activity In copper," said
Mr. Van Duzer, "and the rise in prices
have caused many Inquiries for proper
ties. Golconda now possesses the largest
and most successful copper plant in Ne
vada. The Glasgow Western Exploration
Company has purchased three smelters,
two roasters and a steel concentrating
plant, besides building a narrow-gauge
road into its property. It is putting
through 225 tons a day, and will double
that before long. Its mines are in the
sojath end of a copper belt which has beÂ«jn
traced for thirty-five miles.
"Morton Lelndley, a mining expert of
Chicago, has bonded a group of fifteen
mines for $300,000. Forty-five men are at
work developing them and a rich strike
was recently made. A new town has
sprung up twenty-two miles from Gof
conda called Llndley. Golconda, however,
is the center of the" copper belt. There
are a hundred prospectors and twenty
experts now on the ground. Some own
ers have refused $100,000 for their proper
ties. At Adelaide an apparently inex
haustible mountain of the metal has been
uncovered.
"Golconda a year ago contained one
store and a hotel, and now seven hundred
people have located there. Twenty-two
miles north of Winnemucca, State Con
troller Sam Davis has become Interested
In valuable copper properties. The de
velopment of the industry insures the
erection of at' least twelve smelters and
the employment of over 1000 men if
present indications count for anything.
The New York Company will erect three
smelters ln Golconda.
"The hot springs in that vicinity will
also be developed, and I am Interesting
myself in the building of a sanitarium,
for Golconda will undoubtedly prove to
be a popular health resort."
FIELD DAY FOR SOLDIERS.
First California Have Royal Sport at
Bacolod, Negros Island.
Notwithstanding the martial air which
pervades the Philippines the boys of the
First California have not forgotten the
field day sports in which they par
ticipated at home. A letter recently re
ceived from Bacolod, Negros Island, gives |
an Interesting account of a series of base
ball games which wvere played during the
month of March by picked nines from
the various companies, and also of a field
lav which was held on April 1. The first
game of baseball was between teams
from Companies H and E. The score was
7 to 1 in favor of Company H. The sec
ond of the series was between Companies
A and B, in which the latter won the
day on a score of 9 to 6. Companies H
and B then played off the final for the

CHINESE DENS
OF VICE WILL
BE CLOSED UP
Vigilants Ready to Carry on the
Crusade Against Crime.
They Will Mandamus Every City Official
Who Refuses to Aid Them in
TL â¢ WI S '
Their Work.
THE crusade against the evils in
Chinatown has been fairly started.
Official color was given to it yes
terday, when a number of people
Interested In the purification of
the plague spots met at the office
of Attorney M. M. Foote and formed
themselves into an association under the
name of the Vigilant Society. The officers
elected were: Mrs. John Pettee. presi
dent: Mrs. E. S. Bonelll, vice president;
George Caswell, treasurer: M. M. Foote,
attorney and secretary: Mrs. K. "W. Mc-
Kinley, assistant secretary: Rev. John A.
P.. Wilson and William <;. Badger, direct
ors.
The society has for its objects the In
vestigation of public and private institu
tions, the prevention of cruelty to women
and children, the suppression of vice and
the enforcement of law and order, and its
first work to the exclusion of ail else till
It has been completed, will be for the pur
pose of wiping from the map of China
town the dens of ill fame, opium
Joints, gambling hells and highbinder re
treats. To this end it was decided at the
meeting to address to the pastors of
churches of all denominations in the city
a circular setting forth the objects of the
society and calling upon them for co
operation in the work of purification.
Similar letters it was also decided would
be sent at once to the Mayor, the mem
bers of the Board of Supervisors and the
Chief of Police, calling their attention to
the evils of Chinatown and the law that
provides for their eradication.
It is the Intention of the society to wait
a reasonable time for replies from muni
cipal officials! If they show what is con
sidered a commendable spirit in the mat
ter the society will content Itself with
lending Its aid and furnishing all infor
mation in its power to abolish the evils.
On the contrary, should the officials fail
to respond the society will use its best
endeavors to get along without their aid
and In spite of their indifference. The
war will be carried Into Chinatown on the
Shoulders of the organizers and the sup
porters of the society, who are said to
number _i>J at present, and an attempt will
be made to stamp the evil under foot.
It is hardly thought, however, that any
such action will be necessary. The mem
bers of the Vigilant Society argue that
city ofhciais will need no other spur than
the law pointed out to the Mayor by Mr.
Foote in his letter of last Monday, pub
lish.,: In yesterday's Call. They say that
when the people rose up in their wrath
some months ago and demanded the
closing up of the dens of vice on Berry
and Morton streets and St. Marys place
the law was put In swift motion and the
Inmate of the muses were compel to
vacate In short order. They are conse
quent iv of the opinion that under a spe
cial statu! where the utmost latitude Is
given to witnesses, the plain duty .before
the Mayor, the Chief of Police and the
Supervisors will lie carried out.
If not âand upon this "if not" the so
ciety members announce their determina
tion" to mak." tluir standâ the other thing
will be done. First of all it is proposed
to try the merits of mandamus against
am official who shall fail or refuse to
obey the law. The act of 1866 quoted by
Mr." Foote seems to bear directly on this
point, it reads:
\nd It shall be the duty of the Mayor or
other pre's.ninK officer, ana the Chief or head
of the* police force of every town and city,
and the duty of the Sup'-rvihors of very town
ship er district in which -.;.- such house of
l!l-iame shall -â¢-â â¢â  cause notice in
writing to be given to all persons who may
be owners, Jessies, tenants or occupants of any
tuch h.-cuseiof ill-fame or of the land whereon
the same ii: situated. ' * *
If. from any reason, the Mayor, the
Chief of Police or the Supervisors should
refuse to take the same action regarding
the houses of ill fame In Chinatown
that they recently took with- those on
Morton and St. Marys streets, they will
be haled into court by the Vigilant So
ciety and compelled to do what they
swore to do and have not.
Pending the probability of the necessity
for mandamus proceedings the Vigi
lants are decided to let no grass
grow under their feet. They have
already In their possession maps of
the Chinatown district upon which have
been marked by Chinese in sympathy
with the movement the location of the
various establishments sought to be re
moved. Every den where slave-girls are
hoarded by the vile procurers of China
town, every highbinder resort and opium
joint is indicated. Of houses of ill fame
alone there are about 150. Sullivan, Baker
and Bartletl alleys are lined with them
on both sides, and more are scattered on
Pacific and Jackson streets, behind their
walls being all the way from 700 to 100U
slave-girls held in bondage and paying
tribute to highbinders, who will be com
pelled to scatter when their hiding-places
and Bourees of revenue are closed.
Failing the co-operation of the city of
ficials, the only way to close these dens,
free the slavesâ to be deported if they are
here- Illegally, as most of them areâ and
scatter the yellOW desperadoes who de

pond upon them, seems to be clear to the
Vigilant Society-. Its members propose,
after they have been assured of the moral
support of the community, to send their
emissaries down upon, these dens of vice,
to rest the owners of the property, no
matter how powerful they are In the com
munity, and haul them into court under
the law. As to the inmates of the houses
and the visitors, simultaneous action will
be taken. Agents of the Vigilants will be
stationed night after night at the en
trances to the slave dens to warn every
one who approaches of his liability to ar
rest. Those who heed not the warning
will be turned over to the nearest patrol
man, to be taken to jail. By this means
and by the frequent raids on inmates and
proprietors of the housesâ raids of which
no warning will go beforehand- -it is be
lieved the business can be- made so un
profitable that It will be abandoned In
sheer disgust of loss.
At the meeting of the Vigilants yester
day M. M. Footeg reported his ideas on the
matter, informing his associates of the ac
tion, he had taken in forwarding to Mayor
Phelan notice- of the existence on the stat
ute books of the law of 1866. Foote stated
that lie had received no reply, but was
hopeful that one would reach him within
a day or two. The report was com
mended.
Following this a preamble and resolu
tions setting forth the purposes of the so
ciety were offered and adopted. The ob-
MRS. Nettie R. CRAVEN.
jects stated are: The investigation of pub
lic and private Institutions for the care
of women and children who solicit aid
: from the public on the pretext of charity;
to investigate abuses of guardianships of
children, and to investigate intelligence
offices. The resolutions also declare the
belief that the bom. for the feeble-minded
has been used for the reception of men,
women and children who cannot be
classed under that head and are not eli
gible; that its purposes have been grossly
misused, and that it is filled with persons
the State has no right to care for.
After deciding to incorporate as soon as
the necessary papers could be prepared
the society adjourned to meet next
' Wednesday afternoon at 2 o'clock at room
16. Sherman block, northeast corner of
I Clay and Montgomery streets, when it is
hoped definite plans for the society's work
will be submitted.

FOOTE BITTERLY ATTACKS THE
OPPOSING LAWYERS.
Â»
Says His Client "Was Betrayed and
Now She Asks but an Oppor
tunity to Prove Her
Claims.
â¢
It will be determined in brief time
whether or not Mrs. Nettie R. Craven can
lawfully intervene In the contest of
Charles L. Fair directed against the will
of his dead father. Mrs. Craven, as the
world knows her, but who strenuously
asserts^ that she Is the widow of the de
ceased millionaire, appeared in Judge
Troutt's court yesterday afternoon with
her attorneys, W. W. Foote and Judge
Denson, to demand leave to Intervene in
the contest to the will of the late James
G. Fair. Opposing her a formidable array
of counsel gathered. Charles G. Hegger
ty, who with George A. Knight represents
the contestant, Pierson & Mitchell, attor
neys for the executors of the trust will,
and Garret McEnerney of counsel for the
heirs, carried scores of volumes into
court to meet the claims of the alleged
widow, and an interesting day of legal
argument and personal accusations re
sulted.
W. W. Foote was first to address the
court. "The petition which we have
placed on file shows, as far as the plead
ings in this matter are concerned, that
the petitioner is the widow of the late
James G. Fair; that she is entitled to an
allowance from decedent's estate, and has
a legal interest in such estate," said Mr.
Foote. "All we now ask on behalf of this
petitioner, who is. as I have before said,
admittedly the widow of the decedent as
far as the pleadings are concerned, is an
opportunity to come into court and prove
her claim. It is strange that these gentle
men who represent the executors are so
bitter in their opposition to our applica
tion, and I am surprised tnat Mr. Mitch
ell, whose standing ,at the bar is unques
tioned, should so poise his lance and lead
this host of our opponents. He should
say, as the representative of the exe
cutors, if this is the widow of the late
James G. Fair let her come into court and
prove her claim and thereby establish to
all the world that he is a believer and
supporter of eternal justice. How can the
right of this woman to come into court
and prove her claim affect the executors
of this vast estate? The glitter of mil
lions will still be left for their enjoyment
even though they must turn the profits
to other channels, if. indeed, this will is
not tried and found wanting when we pro
duce our proofs. We are also confronted
with the application of Mr. Heggerty for
a continuance In this matter until 1 he Su
preme Court has passed on the soundness
of Judge Slack's decision holding the
trust clause of no effect, illegal, null. and
void. We do not stand hy Judge Slack's
decision, nor by the ultimate decision
which may be rendered in this case. We
stand by this woman's rights; we care
nothing for past decisions; Tt is to the fu
ture that we have turned our eyes.
"It is within our knowledge also that
other wills are in the possession of the
executors of this estate and that it has
been said that in event the will, the trust
clause of which is now under considera
tion by the Supreme Court, is disposed of
and set aside by the court another will be
filed, and so on until a will is produced i
pleasing to the heirs and that will stand
the test of the law. It might also surprise
the executors of this estate to hear that
perhaps we have other wills in our pos
session, but we do not propose to use
them. I will now state upon this point at
this time, for the instruction of all con
cerned, that if another will is produced
for probate the party presenting such
testament will be arrested and pros
ecuted to the extent of our feeble ability
for not producing it for probate within
thirty days, as provided by law.
"Ah before, I will again say that we
stand by this woman's rights and will see
this matter through to the end. We have
a distinct recollection of the manner in
which ' an ejectment suit against. Mrs.
Fair, my client, was turned into an equi
table case by Judge Slack and an advisory
jury impaneled to hear the issues. We
also recollect' that we had eight of that
jury against four, and .we also recollect
that JUdge Slack repudiated the judgment
of the majority of that body and decided
. With the minority. Hence we care not for
his decisions; we simply stand on our
rights. Judge Slack also denied us the
right to see. the other wills in the hands
of the executors; why, we do not, know.
We would like to see these wills and turn
our own microscopes on them. We do not
ask the judgment of any Ames or other
humbugs, nor advisory juries. We have
the facts and the law upon which to stand
in this matter."
Mr. Foote then dwelt at length upon
the law under which he based his argu
ment that Mrs. Craven has a right to
intervene .in the contest instituted by
Charles L Fair. -He said that although
he recognized the law that it was neces
sary that a contest to a will should be
tiled within one year after the document
had been admitted to probate, the fact
that Mrs. Craven did not file a contest
within that time was not to bar her from
intervening In the present contest, as it
was filed within the year and has since
been kept alive. In conclusion Mr. Foote
spoke bitterly of the heirs, devisees and
legatees of the deceased millionaire's es- |
tate, whom he said willingly in days gone i
by accepted the genuineness of the cele
; brated pencil will, but a? soon as the de- I
; cision was rendered invalidating the trust
â  clause of the trust will they came in one I
j by one and supported it, only at the pres
, ent time reserving their energies to again
! assail its provisions in event the Supreme
i Co Â« r t holds the trust clause to-be valid.
\\e simply ask for an opportunity to
i fight for justice on the proofs we will
; produce,' said Mr. Foote, and then gave
way to Attorney Mitchell, who represent
led the executors. Mitchell Immediately
made an attack: on the action of Mrs.
Craven in now attempting to intervene
; ln a pending contest when she had an op- I
I portunity to file a contest herself within
j the time allowed by law.
j "You know why she didn't file a con
test, interrupted Foote. "It was because
she was in the hands of you lawyers and
was betrayed."
Mitchell took exception to the remark,
and it looked like impending trouble,
when Foote said that he did not directly
charge Mitchell with the betrayal, but
: said that other lawyers well known were
; responsible for the present condition of
affairs. Mitchell then continued, dwelling !
on the sections of the code relative to the j
j right of intervention, and was followed
>by Garret McEnerney. This attorney ,
I said that in his opinion Mrs. Craven was I
| forcing a matter in her attempt to inter-
I vene that would result in her ultimate un
â  doing. "If this court finds that Mrs. |
I Craven has the right to intervene in this I
case," said Mr. McEnerney, "then. the!
; contest instituted by Charles L. Fair must '
itself fall. The law provides that when :
j a contest is brought all the known heirs,
c legatees and devisees must be served with |
I legal process notifying them of the fact
of the filing of the contest. Mrs. Craven
j was not served with process when the
contest was instituted, and Charles L. I
[ Fair must have known that Mrs. Craven
I claimed to be the widow of his dead
father. Hence he violated the law if she
is such widow, and his contest must fall."
Mr. McEnerney then went further into
i the law of intervention and was briefly
j answered by Judge Denson for Mrs.
: Craven. Judge Denson did not take the
opinion of Mr. McEnerney on the process
serving point seriously, holding that even
had Charles L. Fair known that Mrs.
Craven alleged herself to be the widow |
of the deceased he was not forced to
serve her under the law, as he did not
recognize or know her to be in fact such
widow, so this fact he held could not I
affect the standing of the contest.
But little more argument was made, and '
i Judge Troutt put the case over till this !
! morning at 10:30 o'clock. It is said that
I Mr. Wheeler, who represents various of
the heirs and who filed an opposition yes- \
terday to the application of Mrs. Craven I
to intervene In the pending contest, will
make further argument on the lines fol
lowed by Mr. Mitchell and Garret McEn- !
erney. Mr. Heggerty will follow and
Mrs. Craven's lawyers will close. The j
case will then be submitted for decision. !
REGENTS MEET TODAY
IN SPECIAL SESSION
A SUCCESSOR TO MARTIN KEL- [
LOGG MAY BE ELECTED.
Dr. Wheeler of Cornell Will Accept
the Presidency if the Invitation â¢
to Come Is Unanimous.
There will be a special meeting of the
regents of the State University at Mark
Hopkins Institute th's afternoon. A
proposition will be presented to elect a
president of the university to succeed
Martin Kellogg. There is no doubt that
a strong sentiment exists in favor of call
ing to the presidency Professor Wheeler ;
of Cornell, but his friends particularly
desire that his election shall take the I
form of a cordial and unanimous request !
of the Board of Regents for him to ac- j
cept the office It is said to be extremely
doubtful if Dr. Wheeler will accept If any i
opposition to his election is exhibited.
Regents of the university who have ex
plored the Eastern field affirm that Dr.
Wheeler is regarded as one of the fore
most educators of the dayâ a man whose '
merit is so well recognized that several j
prominent institutions 61 learning signify j
a desire tec secure his services.
When he was invited to visit California
the regents extending the invitation said: I
"Come to California, study the situation
and judge for yourself whether the field
Is not larger and more important from a
college point of view than you have esti
mated. After you have looked over the
field carefully, tell us if you can enter- \
tain a proposition to come West."
Dr. Wheeler accepted, and returned to
Cornell impressed with the future great
ness of California. After reflection he in
dicated that a unanimous request to ac
cept the presidency of the university at
Berkeley could hardly be declined, It is
said that a majority .if the board stands |
ready to elect him at any time, but his ;
friends will not advise him to accept if
the regents are not unanimous in request- !
ing him to come.

WANDERED OVER THE HILLS
Catherine Hayes Found After Much j
Suffering an"d Exposure. ' |
Catherine Hayes, an old and slightly j
demented woman, aged .72 years, was
found last night by Police Officer Frank
Kenville at the Halliday ranch on Cres
cent avenue, where she wandered from :
her home at 'â '"â ' Buchanan street.
The old lady left the home of her son, !
John Hayes, on Wednesday afternoon and
started out not knowing where she was
going. Her absence was reported to the
police, and Captain Gillen instructed his
division to keep a lookout for her This !
they did, with, the result that at 9
o'clock last night Kenville telephoned in
for the patrol wagon from the Six-mile
House. !
The woman was found lying at the
foothills, where she had remained over :
the preceding night, devoid 'of any cov
ering save a thin calico dress. Kind
neighbors had in the meantime provided
her with refreshment while the officer
was making preparations for her transit
to the Seventeenth-street station, where
she was met by ncr son, who took her to .
his home in a carriage. Her mental con- i
dition is such that she could not tell her j
name or where she lived.

â â¦ â
THE OTHER COMMISSIONERS
NOT FAVORABLE.
.
I The Appointment of the New Lieu
tenant Is Continued for Two
Weeksâ The Scheme Likely
to Fail.
-â¦
The failure of the Police Commissioners
I to appoint a successor to ex-Lieutenant
> Price, who was disrated some time ago
j by the Police Commissioners, is a source
of considerable speculation to the mem
; bers of the department. There are sev
eral deserving sergeants of police who
aspire to be Price's successor, but for
I some reason the Commissioners have thus
far been unable to agree on a man for the
j position.
From a reliable source it is learned that
Chief Lees favors Joe Dunne, ex-Deputy
District Attorney and present secretary
of the Beard of Health, for the place.
Dunne is on very friendly terms with the
head of the department, being his legal
adviser and almost constant companion
When the new charter was being formed
Lees endeavored to have a clause insert-
NEW SINGER FOR THE

MISS FRANC STRANG, a young California singer, will make her â¢*>.
initial apnearance in comic opera in this city on Monday evening ft
at the Grand Opera-house. Although Miss Strang for the past i*
two years has been charming audiences through the Western ft
States, her appearance with the Southwell company on Monday Â£?
evening will be the first opportunity her many friends in this city ft
will have had of judging for themselves just what she is capable of doing. *3-
Miss Strang will make her initial how to San Francisco in the role of Con- o #
sin Hebe in "Pinafore." The new singer is said to possess a sweet and flexi^^
ble mezzo soprano voice, and to And in the role assigned her a most con- _â¢
genial part. ... ft
Ed allowing the Police Department an at
torney, who was to be known as the legal
adviser to the Chief of Police. His ef
forts were not crowned with success,
much to his disappointment.
Since Price was reduced to sergeant
Lees, it is claimed, has vigorously en
deavored 10 induce the Police Commis
sioners to name Dunne as his successor.
He argued that there were two men in
the department who were drawing salary
and who were not expected to do police
dutyâ Dr. Keeney, the examining physi
cian of the department, and Veterinary
Surgeon Westphal, who attends to the
sick horses belonging to the police.
Both Commissioners Alvord and Tobin
are evidently not disposed to award the
plum to Mr. Dunne. They seem to think
that merit should be rewarded and that
a sergeant of police should be named as
Price's successor.
There are. a number of candidates for
the office, among whom are Sergeants
Shea Martin, McManus, Conboy, Mooney
and Helms. They all have powerful back
ing, but realizing that the head of the de
partment is anxious to have Attorney
Dunne appointed successor to Price, they
have about given up In disgust. Judge
Tobin president of the Police Board, will
shortly leave the city, to he gone two
weeks. On his return it is expected that
the appointment will be made.
Chief Lees last night denied that he was
championing the cause of Dunne. "The
name was not mentioned by me in con
nection with filling the vacancy." he re
marked with considerable vehemence.
"Dunne is mv friend,, but as far as trying
to induce the other Commissioners to ap
point him a lieutenant of police is all rot.
He has a lucrative legal business and
that he should want to forsake it to wear
the star of a lieutenant of police seems
absurd, to say the least. It is true that
the Commissioners cannot agree on a man
to take Price's place, but it is no fault
of mine However, when Judge Tobin
returns from his vacation I guess we will
be able to select a successor to Price."
Notwithstanding Lees' denial. It is au
thoritatively said that he is determined
to have Dunne appointed lieutenant,
whose duties shall be confined to enlight
ening him on legal matters.

Victoria A. Campbell has been granted
a divorce from Martin R. Campbell on the

CHIEF OF POLICE RESURRECTS
AN OLD LAW.
Â«
The Proprietors Regard His Action as
a Joke, hut Are Nevertheless
Preparing Themselves
for a Test Case.
â¦
The police intend to rigorously prose
cute saloon-keepers who persist In defy
ing the law relative to maintaining back
rooms in* connection with their places of
business. There Is an old law on the statute
books, which has become obsolete, which
makes it a misdemeanor to maintain pri
vate rooms with closed doors in a saloon.
Evidently determined to suppress the
back-room trade of saloon-keepers. Chief
Lees has resurrected the old ordinance,
and he says he intends to rigorously en
force it. Last evening he sent copies of
the law to the several captains of the
police, with instructions to enforce it. As
a result every member of the department
was informed of his determination and
were collectively ordered to carry out the
instructions.
Shortly after Lees' edict went forth
several saloon-keepers visited police I
headquarters and asked for an explana
tion of the action of the head of the de
partment. They were told that they
would have to obey the law or suffer the
"The Chief is determined in this mat
ter." remarked one of Lees' lieutenants.
"Closed rooms in saloons don't go any
more."
Evidently thinking that Lees meant to
suppress .the back-room traffic, the sa
loon-keepers notified their fellow-dealers
in liquor, and it was agreed among them
that inasmuch as the law was inoperative
they would disobey the order of the head
of the Police Department.
"This is another of Lees' periodical
bluffs," remarked one of the indignant
saloon-keepers. "We have already con
tributed a , sufficient sum of money to
fight the ordinance in the courts and con
fidently expect to win. A similar attempt
was made some years ago to suppress
back rooms in connection with saloons,
but it signally failed. As soon as an ar
rest of a saloon-keeper for violating the
ordinance is made we intend to make a
test case of it. and expect a verdict in
our favor. The law is a dead letter, and
is unconstitutional, as will be shown at
the proper time."
Notwithstanding that the saloon-keep
ers regard the action, of the Chief of
Police as a joke, many of them, rather
than suffer being arrested, at once pro
ceeded to comply with the law. The pa
trolmen In the various parts of the city
last night visited the various saloons on
their respective beats and made a careful
inspection of the \ "refreshment parlors,"
as some of the bonifaces call them.
Wherever they found that the law was â¢
being violated they took the name of the
proprietor and forwarded it to their re
spective' captains. A particularly aggra
vating case of absolute Independence of
the ordinance is being sought for. and
when found the proprietor of the saloon
will be arrested and the constitutionality
of the ordinance tested.

There are many reasons why such a
new playhouse might be very popular and
the most extensively patronized in San
Francisco, and the managers of the place
seem willing to give the proposition thor
ough consideration, with a result, per
haps, that they will commence the con
struction of the theater in a short time.
Two suggestions for its location have
j been made. The first is that it occupy
j the space now known as the Maple room,
| and the second that it be placed on the
Market street side, in either the present
j dining room or where some of the stores
have been given space.
Should the first plan be adopted an en
, trance will be built on the Jessie street
side, the patrons will also have the ad
â  vantage of the court driveway in wet or
i wintry weather. If the Market street lo-
I cation is found to be the most feasible
I the entrance will lead on to the main
street of the city. When seen last night
I Colonel Kirkpatrick said:
"The proposition is quite feasible. We
have it under consideration, but as yet
it has assumed no definite shape. Should
we attempt it, our intention is to make
it the handsomest theater west of Chi
cago, and no expense will be spared in its
construction. At present I cannot esti
mate what its cost would be. Such a
thing would depend solely on the material
used in its decoration. In size it would
be larger than the Columbia.
"We recognize the great advantages to
be gained by building a playhouse in con
nection with this hotel. Its convenient
location for guests of the hotel is one
and its seat in the heart of the city is an
other. Since the burning of the Baldwin
Theater the hotel patrons of San Fran
cisco have felt the necessity of a theater
hotel and if our plans mature the bill will
be filled."
LAW-BREAKING SOLDIERS.
Troop of Cavalry Called Out to Raid
Barbary Coast Revelers.
About 1 o'clock this morning a soldier
entered a music hall at the Junction of
Montgomery and Pacific streets and pur
chased three bottles of wine, for which
he paid $15. When he-departed he was
told by some companion that he had be.
robbed, and started back to wreck the
saloon. The trouble was quickly stopped
by Sergeant Christianson and squad, but
word in some manner communicated to
the Presidio that a riot was in progress
brought two troops of cavalry to* the
scene.
"When they found their assistance in
this case unnecessary Corporal Richard
son, under whose command they had been
placed, ordered a round up of intoxicated
soldiers on the Barbary Coast. In all
about twenty-five prisoners were taken,
and the homeward march was com
menced. One of the fellows became un
ruly and Richardson attempted to subdue
him. A struggle ensued, in which the
officer was accidentally struck by a car
bine in the hands of a. trooper who came
to his assistance in overpowering the in
toxicated soldier. He sustained a severe
scalp wound and was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital for treatment.
A Bunch of Small Fires.
There were three small fires within a ra
dius of a very few blocks between the
hours of 9 and 11 last night. The first.
from box 95 at 8:30, was for a burning
chimney at 11 Taylor street. No damage
was done. At 9 o'clock an alarm was
sounded from box 45. The fire was in the
three-story frame dwelling at 595 Geary
street, owned by H. E. Heimke and occu
pied by Mrs. J. Thompson as a rooming
house. The fire was caused by sparks
from a chimney and the loss will amount
to about $400. Alarm from box 75 at 10:55
was for the two-story frame building at
22 Seventh street, owned by G. McManus
and occupied by Mrs. E. Nickery. Cause,
coaloil lamp: loss nominal. The depart
ment was also called out on a still alarm
at 15101-2 Powell street. The damage was
about $40; cause unknown.
