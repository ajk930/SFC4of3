WASHINGTON, Feb. 21. âThe following dispatch was received this afternoon from
General Otis:
MANILA, Feb. 21. âAdjutant General, Washington: The following was issued by
, an important officer of the insurgent government at Malalos on February 15,
1899, for execution during that evening and night in this city. OTIS.

The portion of General Otis' dispatch indicated by dashes the officials were unable to
decipher to-night. There is no "fourth" paragraph in the insurgent statement as furnished to
the press.
MANILA, Feb. 21.â The transport
Newport has arrived from Iloilo,
having on board the president
and other representative natives
of the island of Negros. These
men visited General Miller at Iloilo and
discussed the situation with him. They
then returned to Siloy, the principal
town in the northern part of Negros,
and hoisted the American flag. After
ward they returned to Iloilo in order
to embark for Manila to confer with
General Otis.
This new development will probably
have an important effect on the general
â situation in the islands. Negros is one
of the richest islands in the archipelago
and the principal producer of sugar.
The people of Negros have never sym
pathized with either the Tagal or Vi
sayan insurgents and obviously are de
sirous of settling down to peaceful oc
cupations. It it= hoped other islands
.will follow this example.
.'The American troops there are occu
pying the suburbs of Jaro and Molo,
business has been resumed generally
with the outside w< rid. some rice is
â¢coming in from the provinces and there
'has been no fighting since February 12.
The heat is causing some inconvenience
; at Manila, but no casualties have been
reported from that cause.
AGONCILLO SAILS
FROM HALIFAX
HALIFAX, N. P., Feb. 21.â From the
fart that thp name of Agoneillo ap
pears at the foot of the list of cabin
pass^ns^r? r>n the steame- Labrador,
which sailed for Liverpool this morn
ing, it fa confidently asserttd that the
chief agent of the Filipinos has left this
country for Europe. As the Irs., class
passengers for this steamer arrived on
a night express and immedia;ely em
barked no one is known to hay estab
lished the identity of the passenger reg
istered as Agoncillo.
NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â Agoncilo and
his secretary, Marti, left Montreal on
Sunday, announcing that they were
rooming to this city, whence they would
sail on the steamer St. Paul. Marti
W9M seen on the train which left Mont
real at 7 p. m., and was due in this cty
at 7:20 a. m. to-morrow. He took pahs
not to conceal himself at Saratoga, and
as Albany was the last place where h>
was seen it is believed that he remains!
In that city until the next train f<v
Montreal left, and that he returned fÂ»
the Canadian city on it. Meanwhile
both were expected in this city. It is'
thought that Agoncillo sent Marti in
the direction of this city, while he him
self traveled eastward to Halifax.

HONGKONG, Feb. 21.â The following statement has been issued by
the Filipino Junta here:
"Information which has leaked through the Pinkertona sent by Pres
ident MoKinley to investigate the shipment of arms to the Filipinos
shows that the first shipment of arms to Aguinaldo was made by order
of the American Government, through Consul Wildman, hence the ship

egraphed to cease this, coincident with the change of policy to annexa

"Mr. Wildman and Rear Admiral Dewey promised to pay. but have
not yet paid, for a subsequent expedition by the Abbey, authorized by
Admiral Dewey, who afterward seized the steamer and she is still held.
Papers respecting this are now in the possession of the Secretary of the
Navy.
"The protestations of Admiral Dewey and other Americans that they
have made no promises are ridiculous. In view of these facts, let the
American people judge how the nation's word of honor was pledged to
the Filipinos and confided in by them and violated by the recent treach
ery of General Otis."

Bennett.
PARIS, Feb. 21.â Some oF
the Paris papers appear
greatly concerned because
a post mortem examination
of the late M. Faure was not
made and let it be supposed
that the death of the Presi
dent must have been due
more or less to mysterious
causes. The rumor has
even been spread that he
was poisoned.
Such a supposition is sim
ply absurd. There is no
poison capable of producing
the symptoms noticed in the
case of M. Faure by persons
who were with him in his
last hours and by the five
doctors who were called in.
What poison could pro
voke an attack of apoplexy
accompanied by alternate
paralysis ? Professional
men will discuss the ques
tion whether the apoplexy
was caused by cerebral
hemorrhage or by coagula
tion of blood in the blood
vessels, and the supporters
of each of these opinions
will without doubt be able
to bring strong arguments in
suDport of each opinion.
The hypothesis of poison
must be relegated to the
realms of fable, because it
has absolutely no founda
tion in fact.
AUSTRIAN COrtRESPONDENT
MUST LEAVE FRANCE
Special Cable to The fall an<l the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1899, by James Gordon
Bennett.
PARIS, Feb. 21.â As already cabled,
the correspondent of the Vienna Neve
Freie Presse, Dr. Berthold Frischauer,
has been served with notice of ex
pulsion.
Figaro says it is not because he has
manifested sentiments hostile to
France, but because the Government
intends by this step to hint to foreign
correspondents that in future they will
have to observe the most discreet at
titude in regard to the Dreyfus affair.
Siecle asks "if If. Dupuy really thinks
to improve France's good name abroad
by such action." It declares that â¢in
timidation of this sort will simply
arouse the indignation of all foreign
papers. The Spanish Government adopt
ed similar measures at the outbreak of
the late war, but it did not change her
defeats into victories, nor keep her
smash up at Cavite from the ears of
the world. Will Dr. Frischauer's ex
pulsion make Dreyfus guilty or Ester
hazy innocent? Will it prove that the
Government desires to have light on
the matter by trying to extinguish it
on the other side of the frontier?"
These comments are signed by M.
Yves Guyot, political director of Siecle.
They are followed by. an interview
with Dr. Frischauer, in which he says:
"The real reason for my expulsion is
an article In Libre Parole in which my
religion and even my physique were
brought in question. The president of
the council was called upon to expel
me and It Dupuy apparently obeyed.
"I have never insulted France, nor
like some French journals, dragged the
President in the mud."

THOMAS R. BARD, the Latest Richmond
in the Senatorial Lists.
THOMAS R. BARD of Ventura County, the latest Richmond to enter
the Senatorial Held, was in tho city yesterday en route to Sacramento,
whither he has gone in obedience to the summons of his friends. He
is a gentleman of limitless good nature and he apparently possesses
any amount of that diplomatic reserve force that indicates raro latent
ability. When seen at his apartments at the Occidental Mr. Bard said:
"In the strict sense of the wnrcl I am not a politiriari, although T
have been Interested in politics more or less for some years. Of my own
will I am not a candidate for the United States Senate, but I am willing
to defer to the wishes of my friends, who have assured me that T have a
chance. I am now on my way tn Sacramento to meet them for consulta
tion As yet I can hardly speak of my plans, as I do not know what is de
sired of me. I presume that 1 am called to Sacramento to meet those leg
islators with whom I have not the honor of being personally acquainted.
I shall remain there only a short while. This, at least, is my intention at
"I of course, have been informed that the people of Ventura County
favor me as a candidate for the United States Senate and I am also reli
ably informed that there is a sentiment in my favor throughout the
southern part of the State generally. It is with a view of meeting the
southern Senators and Assemblymen and for the purpose of sounding their
wishes that I presume I have been called to Sacramento. I will not
deny that I am willing to become a candidate for the United States Sen
ate but I want to add that T will only do so when it is made clear to me
that the people desire it. as personally I have no desire to thrust myself
before the public.
"I want to commend the course that has been taken by The Call in the
present tight. It has certainly kept its hands off and has declared for no
one as yet Its evident purpose in desiring a clean candidate first and
above all is to be commended by every one who has the true interests of
California at heart."
Hon Thomas R. Bard was born in Chambersburg, Franklin County,
Pa December 8. 1841, the son of Robert M. Bard, an attorney of wideÂ»
practice and acknowledged ability. He is of Scotch-Irish descent. The ad
vent of his ancestors to this country dates back to 1745. They were
among the earliest of Pennsylvania settlers, and took a prominent part in
the struggles of this country for independence.
When the Civil War broke out Mr. Bard was located at Hagerstown,
Md which was on the border between the North and the South and in con
stant danger from rebel raids, and although he had scarcely attained his
majority he enlisted in the Federal army, taking part in the battle of An
tietam and other sharp engagements. His executive ability came before
the observation of Colonel Thomas A. Scott," then Assistant Secretary of
War who took the young man in his command, where he rendered valu
able assistance to the transportation department. In 1865 Colonel Scott in
duced him to come to California to take charge of his large interests in
Ventura and adjoining counties, comprising in all about 277.000 acres of
land. Mr. Bard managed these large estates until Colonel Scott's death,
when he became his administrator, and closed out the property. He was
obliged to give bonds in the sum of $1,500,000. all within the county of Ven
tura but he had no trouble in securing the amount, farmers going on his
bond for all they were worth. Had he defaulted the whole county would
have been bankrupt.
At the present time Mr. Bard is largely interested in the petroleum in
dustry of Southern California, and is one of the chief executives of the
Union Oil Company. He is also president of the Bank of Hueneme and the
Hueneme Wharf Company. He was one of the incorporators of the first
bank of Ventura, and also organized the Simi and Las Posas Land and
Water companies.

Dan Burns or signified any intention to

emptiness of the Burns boast is now
apparent. The day that Simpson so

avowed that all of Bulla's men save

the fact is plain that Burns has not
one man in the Bulla camp.
The touts resorted to desperate meas
ures to force Mr. Bulla to indorse tha
caucus scheme. It was reported to
Herrin that Bulla would be forced into
line. When the ordinary arguments ol
persuasion failed threats were made.
The intimation was thrown out that
Bulla desired to retain his position as
code commissioner, and his friends
were given to understand that reten
tion of the nlace depended upon his
attitude to the caucus scheme. The
threat of removal from office did not
swerve Mr. Bulla from his nurpose to
fight to the finish in the cause of the
people. He resolved to stand for prin
ciple at the cost of surrendering an of
fice worth J4OOO a year.
Burns has gathered in the weak and
faltering. He is beginning to encount
er the men Â»â¢* r-haracter and moral
strength in the Legislature, and is
therefore discouraged at the lack of
progress in his scheme to organize a
secret caucus.
Thomas R. Bard of Ventura arrived
here [o-niprht. He went to quarters at
611 X street, which were reserved for
him by Assemblyman Greenwell. In
response to a message wired to Mr.
Bard at San Francisco by Senator
Rowel!, the favorite son of Ventura
came to the capital. He was welcomed
at the depot by Mr. Greenwell and es
corted to the reserved rooms. Mr. Bard
in speaking of his visit, said to The Call
that he was not a candidate in the com
monly accepted meaning. He came
here at the suggestion of his friends to
look over the flpld and study the sit
uation. After consultation with them
he would decide as to his future course
in the premises. Shortly after 10
o'clock General Barnes called and paid
his respects to his old-time friend from
Ventura. The meeting was extremely
cordial. Mr. Bard has a slight ac
quaintance with U. S. Grant, but is not
acquainted with R. N. Bulla and Colo
nel Burns. As he expressed it. he has
not had the pleasure of meeting either.
Assemblyman Henry W. Brown, who
had been voting for Charles N. Felton
since the beginning of the Senatorial
contest, to-day joined the Barnes
forces and cast his first vote for the
general. A round of applause greeted
the change. If Mr. Brown had given
in advance notice of his intention to
join the cause of General Barnes there
would have been a great demonstration
in the joint convention, but the Assem
blyman's distaste for anything like an
ovation constrained him to keeD his
own counsel and thus avoid a display
of popular approval. Immediately af
ter the adjournment of the joint As
sembly he was surrounded by mem
bers of the Legislature, who extended
their congratulations.
All day long General Barnes has been
receiving the most gratifying assur
ances of coming support. Among the
messages received by wire was the fol
lowing from ex-United States Senator
A. P. Williams:
SAN FRANCISCO. Cal. Feb. 21, 1599.
General V.\ H. L. Barnes, Golden Eaglo
Hotel. Sacramento, Cal.: Your splendid
services rendered the Republican party
for many years deserve recognition. I
hope and believe that you will be elected
Senator. A. P. WILLIAMS.
There was another change to-day in
the joint convention which was not re
garded as significant by the average
spectator, but to those who are familiar
with the undercurrent of affairs here
and understand what is going on be
hind the scenes the change signifies
something of importance to be devel
oped later on. The incident referred to
is the vote cast for John Rosenfeld by
Assemblyman M. Brooke of Sacra
mento, representing the Twenty-second
Assembly District. Mr. Brooke is a
Democrat or Populist, and at the be
ginning of the session was threatened
by a contest for his seat, the contem
plated contestant being William John
ston. A promise was made to Brooke
by parties representing the Southern
Pacific Company that if he would get
into line for Dan Burns for Senator the
contest would be withdrawn, but if he
did not so line up he would be unseated.
The Call promptly exposed the scheme
to corral a Burns vote in this fashion
and subsequently the contest was with
drawn. About the same time The Call
sounded a note of warning that Demo
cratic votes for Dan Burns were being
staked out under the cover of Rosen
feld. and that when Sam Rainey gave
the signal the men voting for Rosenfeld
would change to Colonel Burns. The
cunning play will bear close watching.
The touts continue to work on the
caucus scheme, but are making no
progress. Efforts now are mainly di
rected to securing indorsements of the
scheme from county committees. The
resolutions are prepared in Dan Burns*2

ASSEMBLYMAN HENRY WARD BROWN,
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Feb. 21.â Assemblyman
Brown of San Mateo County deserted Charles N. Felton at the joint bal
lot this noon and cast his vote for General W. H. L. Barnes.
Ever since the session opened Mr. Brown has cast his vote per
sistently for Mr. Felton, notwithstanding that every other candidate in
the fight has paid him court of the warmest kind.
His vote has been claimed for weeks by the Barnes people and to
day he has made their claim good.
There was no other change, nor was there any indication of the
break that has been boasted. Except for the change of Brown the bal
lot was absolutely without incident.
It resulted as follows:

Stratton submitted an amendment to the
report of the Committee on Rules relating
to. 'the consideration of the Hies, which
provided for the recognition of the sadly
neglected third reading file. The third

Second reading, dragging with It the
weight of an adverse report of the Judi

John S. Cox or Pasadena and Frank Do
minguez. In his question of privilege
Senator Simpson said:
"What I desire to say. Mr. President, is
this: That the Hon. John S. Cox, whose
letter I have seen fit to give to the Rec
ord-Union of Sacramento and other repu
table papers, which I knew would not
garble and distort the statements made
therein, was born in the State of Ohio,
in these United States, under the Ameri
can flag, and no man has ever stood more
firmly by the Republican party than John
S. Cox. an ex-Mayor of the city of Pasa
dena. No person has had more Inherent
right to vote in the general elections of
the county of Los Angeles and the State
o.f California, and no person's voice has
had more weight than that of John S
Cox.
"Now, in reference to Frank Domin
guez. he is a man who, while having been
the friend of Senator Bulla all through
the last campaign, has seen fit to make a
statement to me that his belief was that
Daniel M. Burns was the logical candi
date for United States Senator and ought
to be elected, and has written to me
which letter I cad produce, to show that
I have carried out the instructions and
the real intentions of those to whom I
refer In my remarks upon the question of
privilege. I cannot help but feel that I
have been misquoted and in the heat of
the moment I pronounce the person that
wrote the article In The Call, a miserable,
low-down, dirty calumniating sheet as an
infernal damn Har. I have served the peo
ple of the State of California for eight
years. I never in my life took a dishonest
dollar; I have never In my life done a
thing I believed was dishonest; I have
come here at the sacrifice of my business,
and it does seem strange to me that a
person who has done as much for as lit
tle remuneration should not at least have
accredited to him honest motives. While
I am aware that I am under bans to-day
from those who believe that a man has
no rights except those that are instructed
to him, I cannot help but feel that a man
who le intrusted with discretion should
be once in a while allowed to use that dis
cretion which the people have entrust' d. I
have read many newspaper accounts upon
my Â«'ourse in this Senatorial election 'and
while it grieves me to think that some
of my people attribute dishonest motives
to me, I cannot help but stand up and
say Â«Â»hat I have done that which I be
lieve to be not only for the best interests
of the Republican party of the State of
California, but of the people of the whole
State."
A petition from the residents of the
southern portion of Monterey County set
ting forth the destitute condition of a
great number of the residents there and
asking aid for 4000 of them was presented
to the Senate this afternoon. The peti
tion says there are 2000 families averag
ing four people to a family and half of
these are in need of immediate assist
ance. The petition asks that $20 apiece
or $80,000 be appropriated for their relief
There is .a promise that it will be paid
back.
It was expected that the Senate would
r< si over Washington's birthday, but
there was no such luck. Senator Strat
ton submitted a resolution declaring . L
the purpose of the Senate to hold a ses
sion to-morrow, and the resolution was
adopted. The pages were given a night

BILLS PASSED BY THE
SENATE YESTERDAY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 21.â The Senate to-day
adopted Mark's Assembly joint resolution
relative to the setting over and establish
ing granite posts to mark a true bound
ary line between California and Nevada.
During the day the Senate passed Senate
bills 326 and 446. The first of these, in
troduced by Stratton, amends the title to
an act entitled "An act to provide for the
payment of interest on the outstanding
bonds of the State of California, hsld in

NAPA ASYLUM
WANTS TOO MUCH
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 21.â A bill for the appropri
ation of $155,000 for a dam and reservoir
for the Napa Insane Asylum was hit
with an ax by the Senate this afternoon
and it fell but little short of annihila
tion. The Committee on Finance and
Claims had a first chance at it and cut
the figure to $75,000. When the bill came
before the Senate Senator Rowell had
another amendment to offer. He had been
on the last junket to Napa, and as was
remarked afterward by Senator Bulla, it
was one junket that had brought some
results Senator Rowell swanted to cut
the appropriation to $30,000. His idea and
that of the other members of the commit
tee was that it was only necessary to
purchase the materials and tools required
for the work and let the actual labor be
performed by the capable Inmates of the
Institution.
Senator Smith was in favor of either
allowing the asylum a sufficient sum or
so place the matter that the report of
experts could be secured upon the prob
able cost of the work. La Rue, who in
troduced the bill, declared he would
sooner see the bill defeated than have the
appropriation so materially shortened.
On a vote Rowell's amendment was lost.
The bill was then laid over to be further
amended to provide more safeguards for
the appropriation and then the bill will
come up as amended by the committee to
appropriate $75,000.

AN ERROR OF AN
INITIAL CAUSES
MUCH TRIBULATION
Senator Simpson Waxes Wroth
and Uses Bad Language Over
a Mistake of The Call.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 21.â "Damned infernal
liar," is what Simpson said on a ques
tion of privilege in the Senate to-day,
referring to the author of the state
ment published in The Call that John
S. Cox was 1 a "bloomin" Britisher."
Â« Cox commended Simpson's conduct In
changing his vote from Bulla to Burns.
The Record-Union of Sacramento, in
an effort to brace up poor old Simpson,
published an extract from Cox's letter
to the Senator. A prominent citizen of
Los Angeles County, observing the
newspaper comment, informed The Call
that Cox was not a naturalized citizen
ariti that his home was not in Pasadena,
but in Los Angeles. Now it happens
that Los Angeles County covers con
siderable territory and embraces a large
population. It also happens that the
Cox family is quite numerous and act
ive in that region. of the State and that
the members have quite a liking for
real estate and insurance business.
The particular Cox which the inform
ant of The Call had in mind was John
H. Cox, a real estate dealer in Lob
Angeles, who extends his operations to
Pasadena. It was recollected that he
opposed Hawaiian annexation and gave
as a reason that he was an Englishman.
The Call wired to Los Angeles to as
certain what Mr. Cox had said in a pub
lished interview. The reply came as
follows:
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 21, 1599.
In Record, January 20, 1898 (not in the
Express), thus: John H. Coxâ l am an i
Englishman and want England to get the
islands. I do not think the United States
can govern its own country and am
against annexation.
Inquiry was made by -wire to ascer
tain the residence of the particular Cox
that commended Simpson, and the fol
lowing message from Pasadena was re
ceived:
PASADENA. Feb. 21. 1899.
Yes, John S. Cox, a real estate agent,
resides here.
Investigation therefore establishes
the fact that John S. Cox lives in Pasa
dena, and It Is presumed that he wrote
the letter commending Senator Simp
son. However, The Call hastens to
apologize to the "bloomin* Britisher"
who bears the name of John H. Cox.
It is clear that John H. Cox, the man
referred to in The Call of yesterday,
did not write the letter of commenda
tion to Senator Simpson and the latter
which he did receive was from John
S. Cox of Pasadena. So much for the
Cox family.
In regard to Dominguez, The Call r<>.
iterates the assertion that he has, since
the opening of the Legislature, written
letters to Senator Bulla wherein loy
alty to the Senator's cause is pledged.
Simpson in his imbecile rage may roar
and use language that ought not to be
tolerated in the Senate, yet the fact re
mains, and is capable of proof, that
Dnminguez a few days ago was a Bulla
man. His letters to that effect can be
produced, if proof be challenged.
COMMITTEE WORK
WAS RATIFIED
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 21.â The Committee on Hos
pitals, which has recently been engaged
in burning up mileage money in a junket
through the State, came back with some
unkind things to say of the hospital for
the insane at Ukiah. The report ren
dered to the Assembly recites at length
the. story of the merry row that has been
going on betwee.n the Board of Man
agers and the Superintendent of that in
stitution. It says there is a lack of co
operation in the conduct of the asylum
and that as a result the inmates are neg
lected. Concerning the Home for the
Feeble Mtndedat Eldridge, the committee
was high in its praise and recommended
the passage of enactments looking to the
betterment of the establishment.
The Judiciary Committee reported fa
vorably upon Caminetti's proposed con
stitutional amendment exempting all land
and improvements thereon from taxation
for State purposes. Mr. Caminetti Pays
the exemption he proposes is already oper
ating in the State of Pennsylvania and
that that State has grown wealthier since
the plan was inaugurated.
Radcliff's constitutional amendment No.
4, which is designed to abolish the Rail
road Commission, was reported favorably
by the committee, but amended so that it
â will not become operative until January
1, 1902.
The Committee on Health and Quaran
tine, which spent Sunday visiting the
garbage crematory at San Francisco, put
in an expense bill of $144, and the Com
mittee on State Prisons, which went to
San Quentln, rendered an account of $96.
Both were ordered paid.
Governor Gage' 3 veto messages on- bills
2 and 243 came up under the. head of un
finished business and in each case the
Executive's disapproval was sustained.
Senator Braunhart's "seawall bill" came
up on the Senate special file and was im
mediately attacked by Caminetti, who of
fered an amendment which provided that
as rapidly as the seawall is builded the
belt line railroad shall be laid down. His
amendment was adopted and the bill was
sent back to the printer.
Assembly bill 691, which permits the sale â 
of prison-crushed rock to contractors for
use on city streets, was passed after a
flght made against it by Hoey of San
Francisco. Hoey offered an amendement
providing that all rock should be sold at
a minimum cost of 40 cents per ton on the
prison grounds. His amendment was
voted down and the bill passed. Speaker
Anderson's bill, which was designed to
accomplish a contrary proposition, was
withdrawn from the tile.
Muenter's Assembly bill 206. relating to
the filing of the statements of assets and
liab'lities by banking corporations, was
passed in spite of the hard fight made
by Le Barron of Sonoma.
Atherton's Assembly bill 128, appropriat
ing $75,000 for the erection of a hospital
for insane convicts, was passed, as were
the following:
Kenneally's Assembly bill 617, appropri
ating $75,000 for the boring of a well in the
Capitol grounds; Rickard's Assembly bill
322, relating to elections; Dibble's Assem

SOUGHT TO BRIBE MORRIS BROOKE
CHARLES N. POST.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Feb. 21.â 1n its Issue of Jan
uary 6. 1899, The Call published an expose of the disgraceful attempt that
was then being' made by Dan Burns and the Southern Pacilic Company to
bribe Morris Brooke, Democratic member of the Assembly from Sacramento
County, to vote for Burns for United States Senator.
At that time the name of the man who conducted the negotiations on the
part of Burns and the railroad company was not given .because it was not
known by the representatives of this paper. The Call is now in possession
of the name of the man who made the offer to Brooke. His name is Charles
N. Post.
At that time Post was a public office holder in tho pay of the State, he
being Assistant Attorney General under Attorney General Fitzgerald. He
now holds the same position under Attorney General Ford. While draw
ing pay from the State, Post was interesting himself In promoting Burns'
Senatorial candidacy to such an extent thai he sought by threats, intimi
dation and the offer of a bribe to debauch a young man and cause him to
bolt his party, betray his constituents, deny hid sworn duty and violate the
dictates of his own conscience. His attempt to do so failed of success be
cause The Call exposed the details of the Infamous plot before it could be
consummated.
Not being known as the man who had carried out the orders of Burns
and the railroad company in the attempt to bribe Assemblyman Brooke, Poat
was not robbed of his usefulness as confidential agent of the Mexican. He
has since been one of the most active workers in the Burns corral, and
the fact that he continues in his employment as a Senatorial boomer may
be taken as proof positive that he is looked upon by his master as a valua
ble factor in the' most disgraceful Senatorial campaign that has ever put
a blot on the fair fame of the State. #
Assemblyman Brooke's opponent at the last election was William John
ston. Brooke was elected by a majority of sixty-one votes. Shortly after
the result of the election was announced proceedings to contest Brooke's
election were instituted in the Justice's Court of Sacramento. For a time
the matter rested. The men who planned the contest on behalf of Mr.
Johnston were evidently waiting to receive overtures from the Assembly
man-elect. As this did not happen, an emissary of Burns and the railroad
company visited Mr. Brooke and made this offer:
"If you will agTee to vote for a certain man for United States Senator
whose candidacy has riot yet been announced we will see that the contest by
William Johnston for'your seat will be abandoned."
Mr. BTOoke refused to bind flimseif to any such agreement. Brooke be
lieved that this WouM end the matter, but he was doomed to disappoint
ment; for it was at this stage of the proceedings that Post appeared on the
scene as the accredited agent of Burns and the railroad company. He made
an appointment with the Assemblyman-elect and then offered him a bribe,
which was in substance as follows: "If you will agree to vote for Dan Burns
for United States Senator Johnston's contest will be dismissed and you will
be able to retain your seat in the Assembly. If you dc> not consent to this
proposition, you will be unseated, as Burns controls the Assembly and can
unseat you by holding up his finger. If you vote for Burns and stay with
him to the finish you can have a place in the County Clerk's office after the
adjournment of the Legislature and you can hold this place and receive a
good salary every month for four years."
Post then related to Mr. Brooke that William Hamilton. County Clerk of
Sacramento County, in return for railroad support in his election, had prom
ised to give J. B. Wright, superintendent of the Southern Pacific Company,
at Sacramento, one appointment in the County Clerks office. It was this po
sition that was at Mr. Brooke's disposal if he would consent to vote for
Burns for United States Senator.
This in brief is a history of the disgraceful scheme to bribe a legislator.
The readers of The Call are familiar with the full details as they were pub
lished in these columns at the time the scheme was exposed. As a result of
the exposure the contest for Brooke's seat in the Assembly was summarily
dropped and he was allowed to take the place to which he was elected and
vote according to the dictates of his conscience.
The man who made these proposals to Assemblyman Brooke was Charles
N. Post. He then was and still is an officeholder of the State. He wa3 then
and is still a worker in the camp of Dan Burns.
At the time the Assembly investigating committee was engaged in the
task of investigating the charges made by The Call against Howard E.
Wright and others representatives of this paper sought to have the commit
tee take up the matter of the attempt that was made to bribe Assembly
man Brooke. For some unknown reason the committee ignored the request,
and the men who- were instrumental in tne scheme of bribery arc still unpun
ished. The investigating committee is Btlll in existence. Honest men may
believe that it has a duty to perform that the members of the committee as
honest legislators cannot shirk and continue to retain the respect of the peo
ple of the State.'
was of' a consequence no pressing need
for a clerk on the 7th, three days before.
Others In the House took the question up
anfl "Big Bill's" resolution finally went
over as unfinished business.

Informal Caucus Reveals the Fact That When a Break
Comes the Los Angeles Candidate's Supporters Will l
... . Avoid the Candelarian Corral.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 21.â Senator Bulla has
offered to release those legislators who
have been voting for him for United
States Senator from any obligations,
expressed or implied, that have here
tofore actuated them in choosing him
as their leader. In reply to this his
followers have told him that for the
present at least they prefer to march
under his standard and will therefore
continue to vote for him for the balance
of the present week at least.
Senator Bulla's offer was made this
morning at a caucus of his forces held
at the State Capitol. It was called at
his request and for the purpose of al
lowing him an opportunity to thank the
men who have stayed with him so loy
ally and to tell them of his determina
â¢ tion to release them.
After greetings had been exchanged
Senator Bulla claimed the attention of
those present and stated that it was
his intention to announce on the Boor
of the joint assembly that those Sena
tors and Assemblymen who had been
. honoring him with their votes need feel
â  under no obligations to do so any
longer as he publicly released them
from their allegiance. He intended to
do this, he said, because he was anxious
to break the deadlock and see a United
States Senator elected. He had been
told that his candidacy was in a meas
ure preventing such an event, and while
he did not subscribe to that view of the
case he was too good a Republican to
te after he had been told that he
was standing in the way of the ad
vancement of the best interests of the
ty.
Still another reason for his proposed
â¡ was. he said, that Dan Burns
and his supporters were claiming that
ye men in the Bulla
camp. If this were so, he said, he
wished to step aside and give such of
his followers who wanted to vote for
Bums an opportunity to do so.
There was e%"idently a good measure j
of sarcasm in what the Senator had i
to say under the head of "Burns sup
porters." as every one knows, and he
perhaps best of all. that if Bulla's tot
~ tvere to be scattered to-morrow i
Burns would not get to exceed one of J
them in spite of the fact that his touts j
have been hard at work for two months j
on the men who have consistently voted
-for Bulla from the first ballot.
After Senator Bulla had fully ex
plained his position to his followers
they, without exception, declared their
unwillingness to ailow him to with
draw his candidacy or to publicly re
lease the legislators who are voting for
him. Senator Taylor pointed out that
such a declaration on the floor of the
Joint Assembly might be misconstrued
and taken as a cheap method of gain
ing notoriety and a reputation for do
litical generosity. He thought, as did !
the others, that those who were voting
for Bulla should discuss among them
eelves their views as to a second choice '
candidate with the object in view of j
going to. him in a body in the event
they should consider at some future
time that Bulla had no chance of elec
tion. For the present all agreed to
continue to vote for Bulla and
he was finally persuaded to forego his
intention of making a public declara
tion.
During the informal discussion that
followed this decision a majority of
those present expressed their choice in
the matter of Senatorial candidates
â¢who are at present before the Legisla
ture. Assemblyman Miller of Los An
geles was the only one who claimed any
. candidate as his second choice for Sen
ator. He said that he wished to vote
for Grant if he ever left Bulla, but that
he would never desert Bulla unless the
balance of his supporters went at the
â ame time. Others present expressed a
â willingness to vote for this candidate
or that, in order to break the deadlock,
provided the other Bulla men agreed
te for such candidate in a body.
Assemblymen Valentine, Conrey and
iared their desire to vote for
a Southern California man, and said
they would not be adverse to any prop
osition to go t> Thomas R. Bard of

A CINCH GAME
ON PLACERVILLE
An Effort Made to Collect an
Old and Unjust Debt on
Railroad Bonds.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 21.â cleanest cut cinch
game that has sought the legalizing en
actment of the present Legislature has
been unearthed in Senate bill 648, and the
people of the city of Placervllle are up in
arms to defend themselves against the
onslaught that is threatened on their
treasury by a clique of grafters that has
for years been seeking to make profit out
of the financial misfortune of historic old
"Hangtown."
Senate bill 648. if it be passed, will open
the door of the city treasury to a cold
steal of $240,000, a bagatelle In some quar
ters, but a large enough amount to set
Placerville so far back In her finances
that the ultimate result of the shock can
not be foreseen.
Placerville'a troubles have started as
have the woes of many of the prosperous
mining towns of the mountains â at the
hands of the beneficent railroad. Back in
the early sixties the people of old El Do
rado wanted a railroad and they wanted
It badly, so much so that they were will
ing to pay a portion of the price. The
railroad wanted El Dorado and It wanted
It just as bad as is the fashion of rail
roads, and it was more than willing that
El Dorado should pay the price.
The people of El Dorado and the cor
poration finally came together, and as the
result of the meeting the Sacramento
Valley Railroad Company, a fractional
part of the Southern Pacific, agreed to
put a line through to Placervllle. It was
an expensive task, however. The high
est bridges and the stlffest grades in the
State characterized the route and the
company suggested that the people at the
other end of the line bond their town for
$35,000 and turn the issue over to the com
pany to be realized on. In return the
company would put a line through to
Piacerville without undue delay.
The bargain was struck and the city
went into debt and in good faith. The
railroad people started their road and
stopped at Folsom, Just forty miles from
making good their promise. After years j
of delay the work was" begun again and |
the road finally attained Shingle Springs;
there it stopped and nothing more was I
done uncil 1239. when the company had j
saved enough by exorbitant freights and j
worse fares to close the fifteen-mile gap
between Shingle and Placerville. Since
that day the mountain town has been
("accommodated" with the most abomina
ble service In the State.
Meanwhile the company sold Placer
vine's bonds for their face. The first
cessation of work followed immediately
upon the sale. When the holders of the
bonds called upon Placerville for pay- \
ment the people there rung up Folsom j
and asked if work on the road was prog- ;
ressing as per agreement, and when they I
found that the compact Had been broken |
as soon as the cash was in hand , they â 
promptly repudiated their indebtedness.
Suit was brought against the town, but '
when the summonses were made out there
was no one found to serve them upon:
every officer of the city had resigned his
job and was rusticating somewhere up
the Tahoe road. At the next election the !
citizens of the town refused to participate !
and ever since that day the government '
of Placerville, though an incorporated !
town, has been administered by the offi
cers of the county.
Suit after suit and judgment upon judg
ment have been filed and with accrued in
terest and judgment the original debt of
$35,000 now amounts to $240,000 and a few .
dollars over.
During the past few years Drury Me- i
lone, the Napa capitalist, acting as agent !
for a syndicate, has been buying the
bonds at from 15 cents to 30 cents on the
; dollar, and he now controls nearly the
whole issue. He has had the backing of
the railroad in all his deals and schemes I
of every variety have been tried in an j
effort to induce the town Into a position â 
where it could be mulcted. Everything
falling the force of legislative enactment \
is now to be tried, and the following bill >
is Intended to accomplish what the
schemes have failed in:
Section L Whenever in any incorporated city
In this State there baa been no election for \
municipal officers for a Dertod of more than .
: two years, and the municipal officers last !
1 elected have failed for more than two years
to discharge the duties of the offices to which '.
they were elected. It shall be the duty of the t
Governor of the State of California within i
thirty day* after thÂ« passage of this act to nil |
such offices by appointment.
Section 2 provides that It shall be the duty
of the municipal officers appointed as provided
In section 1 of this set to make provision as
soon as possible for the holding- of an election
; by the qualified â¢ electors of such Incorporated
cities to fill such municipal offices. Such eUc- i
ton shall be held as if there had not been a
failure to elect for more than two years, as i
provided and declared in the first section of this
Met
Sec. 5. Upon the assumption of office by thÂ« i
â  elected â¢ officers of such incorporated city, as â 
I provided above, the municipal officers so ap

ORATORY EXPENDED
ON THE BLACKSMITH BILL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 21.â There was more ora
tory in the Senate at its session this even-
Ing, but it was of the jovial not the bit
ter kind, as was the case last night when
young Mr. Works' bill was passed upon.
Senator Shortrldge's maiden effort in leg
islation, the bill to allow a lien upon a
horse by the unpaid blacksmith who had
shod it, came on the urgency file for sec
and and" third reading and for final pas
sage. There was a great deal of merri
ment at the expense of the bill, but hon
ors were about even. There was more
parliamentary law expended on the prog
ress of the bill toward Its final downfall
than Is usually accorded a Senate mea
sure, and when it came to voting on a
motion to deny the bill a third reading
the Senate got on the wrong track and
actually passed it up for final passage
Instead of consigning it to the grave, for
which the motion had Intended it. This
oversight was remedied, however, on rhe
final passage of the bill, for it was de
feated by a vote of 17 to 13, Senator Short
ridge having changed his vote from aye
to no in order to move for a reconsidera
tion.
Senator Dickinson made the first assault
by moving to strike out the section pro
viding for the foreclosure of the liens.
To this Shortridge objected and in doing
so spoke long and earnestly for his meas
ure as one looking to the protection of
honest labor and a help to the poor me
chanic, who. he said, referring fo other
measures regulating the methods of court
.procedure, was as much entitled to pro
tection for his hard earned money as was
the rich lawyer for his fat fee. Dickin
son's amendment was lost.
Then Smith pointed out some clause he
was not satisfied with, and it took Short
ridge another ten minutes to explain why
there was nothing wrong with the sec
tion Smith referred to.
Curtin next. claimed the floor with an
amendment that the provisions of the bill
should not apply to sections of the State
higher than an altitude of 1500 feet above
the sea.
This riled the Santa Clara Senator and
he warned the Senate that some time
some of them would have pet measures
, to pass and he would retaliate by mo
tions for delay and vexation numerous
enough to keep the two stenographers
busy for a month. Curtin' s amendment
was lost and, nothing daunted, he submit
ted another striking out the words "ox"
and "mule" wherever they occurred, for,
said he. he wanted to protect them. This
amendment, too, was lost.
Bulla then submitted an amendment that
found favor with the author of the bill.
MEXICAN DAN: "I'LL DO IT WITH MY LITTLE HATCHET."
but that, too, went the way of the others
and was downed a second time on Leav
ltt's motion to reconsider. Then Curtin
moved that the bill be denied a third
reading and the question was put. "Shall
the bill be denied a third reading?" Twen
ty-seven of the Senators voted "no*? in
an effort to deny the reading and found
they had voted not to deny the reading
and the bill was read again.
The vote on rollcall stood 16 to 14 against
the bill. Shortrtdge demanded a call of
the absentees and then a call of the
House. There was a rollcall on the call of
the House demanded and ordered, bnt it
was stopped, and then Shortridge changed
his vote from aye to no. and when the
vote had been announced he gave notice
of a motion to reconsider. It will prob
ably be dealt with to-morrow.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY
MUST PAY ITS TAXES
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 21.â The plan to exempt a
great deal of the property of the Stanford
Unversity from State taxation was ruth
lessly downed in the Judiciary Committee
of the Senate this evening. It was ordered
reported back to the Senate with the rec
mmendation that It do not pass.
The exemption was contained in Assem
bly constitutional amendment 23, submit
ted by Assemblyman Clarke. The amend
ment provided that "All property now c
hereafter to be held In trust for the found-
Ing or the benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, or of any department
thereof, may be exempted by special act
from State taxation, and all personal
property so held, the Palo Alto farm aa
described in the endowment grant to the
trustees of the university, and all other
real property so held and used by the uni
versity for educational purposes exclu
sively, may be similarly exempted from
county and municipal taxation; provided
that residents of California shall be
charged no fees for tuition, unless 3uch
fees be authorized by act of the Legisla
ture." ._
There were not many present at the
meeting, nor was Senator Storehouse, who
was supporting the amendment In the
Senate, at the committee to speak for his
measure. There was a quorum, however,
and the matter was referred back with
the adverse recommendation by a vote of
4 to 3, Senator Sims casting the deciding
vote, because, as he said, he considered it
a very dangerous piece of legislation. It
was pointed out that the power to ex
empt was left discretionary with the Leg
islature both as to time of exemption and
quantity of property to be exempted, and
it was deemed by the committee to be
unwise to allow any such unrestrained
latitude.
The matter will be brought up again
before the committee if Senator More
house wishes to be heard on the amend
ment, but only as a courtesy to him.
The committeemen expressed themselves
as having heard argument enough on the
subject, as it has been under discussion
many times.
The amendment containsTnore than the
mere exemption of the college property
from taxation. It provides for the con
firmation, permission and approval of all
the endowments, gifts, grants and be
quests that have been turned over to the
institution, and granting to the trustees
full corporate power.
The objection to the measure, however,
lies In the clause of exemption, and upon
that Is the unfavorable report based.
OAKLAND WILL GET HER
HARBOR COMMISSION
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. a.â Senator Leavltt's bill
creating the harbor of Oakland and estab
lishing a harbor commission to control It
I practically passed the Senate on the
urgency file this evening.
The bill is the result of agitation for a
proper system of government over the
. Oakland harbor, and has been in the pro
; cess of construction ever since the Su
; preme Court decided the celebrated water
front case and defined the rights of the
city and of private individuals and cor
porations in the water front property.
There had been some conflict of opinion
about how far the bill should go in the
description of the limits of the "harbor,"
; and that subject was the theme of an
'< amendment submitted by Leavitt.
In the amendment the limits of the har
bor were changed to include both the
! property the courts had decided belonged
: to the city and State and that belonging
; to Individuals, but it was provided that
' the harbor commissioners should have
] jurisdiction over that portion only which
' belongs to the city and State.
The amendment must be printed in the
; bill and then it will come un for final
passage, but as the main point has been
i decided by the passage of the amendment
! the passage of the bill itself Is assured.
MORE BUGS FOUND
IN THE SCHOOL BILL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 21.â Senate bill 36. with its
mate. Assembly bill 639. not only contains
; the amendment to section 1617 of the Po
: lltleal Code affecting the tenure in office
: of the teachers in San Francisco, but it
appears there are other "bugs" in it.
Section 1674 is so amended that not only
; will the number of principals be reduced.
. but that teacher's horror, the "inspector,"
j will be re-established in his old position.
j The amended section reads as follows:
"In schools of more than one teacher
'â  the board of school trustees or city Board
of Education must designate one of the
tearhers as principal of the school, who
: shall have general supervision of the en
tire school; provided, that nothing in
this section shall be so construed as to
prevent boards of trustees and boards of
education from selecting a principal to i
; supervise the work of two or more schools
In one school district."
San Francisco constitutes but one '
j school district, and there would be noth- j
I ing to prevent, if this amendment car- j
i rles, boards of education Â£rom districting |
â¢ the city and appointing "inspectors" un- |
der the name of "principals." as under '
1 the "Pooh-bah" Stone board, by which !
', John Swett and many other educators â 
j were thrown out of the School Depart- !
: ment some years ago.
Section 1663 Is so amended as to lengthen !
; the time of pupils In the schools before j
i entering- the high school, from eight to ;
ten years. This will waste two years of ;
1 the pupil's life and Increase the expense
'of the department by employing more '
teachers.
An amendment to section 1622 provides j
that "all of the State school fund and SO ,
per cent of the county school rund ex- !
elusive of the library fund must be used !
exclusively for the payment of salaries j
iof teachers of primary and grammar
schools." The fund would be so exhaust- j
cd. If this becomes a law. that the amount J
needed to conduct the high schools, pur- i
chase supplies for all schools, make re- :
pairs, pay janitors and take the annual
school census would be but fc:14.000 per !
I annum, while at least $360,000 is needed :
for these purposes. This would practical- :
'â  lv mean the closing of the high schools i
:of San Francisco, as the primary and j
grammar schools, under the law, must j
; first be provided for. The committee. ;
| Colonel Charles H. Murphy and W. D. j
Kingsbury, have been working on this '
bill alone thus far. but will now take up !
1 the remaining sixty educational bills and '
carefully scrutinize them for inconsist- !
enciea and legal flaws.
At the meeting of the Assembly Com
mittee on Education this afternoon it was !
decided to remove the objectionable :
clauses of the bill and eliminate section {
, 6, relating to the exact time teachers are
|to be employed. The section, eliminated J
reads: "Provided, that on or before the
20th day of June of any year the Board of
School Trustees or City Board of Edu
cation shall meet and by ballot elect
teachers for the ensuing school year."
By the amendmemt suggested by the
teachers' committee, which came before
the committee this afternoon, it was de
cided to Insert the words "that on the
Saturday on or before the 20th day of
June" the teachers are to be elected.

ALGER'S TRIP WILL BE
A VERY LONESOME ONE
If He Goes to Cuba on a Government Trans
port He Must Make the Journey
All by Himself.
82 NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â The Herald's Washington correspondent 8S
88 telegraphs: Secretary Algers junket to Cuba and Porto Rico may be 83
88 a fizzle and he may have to abandon it at go by himself. Though 88
88 Secretary Alger may see no impropriety in taking a shipload of 83
58 gentlemen and ladies on a pleasure trip on a Government transport 88
88 at the Government's expense, the sense of propriety of Senators and 88
88 Representatives is not so dull, and many of those invited have al- 88
88 ready declined the Secretary's invitation. I was told to-day that 88
88 Senators Bate, Cockrell and Pasco, and Representatives Sulzer. Hay. 88
88 Cox and Jett had declined, and that they would not go even if Sec- 88
retary Alger should pay all the mess bills out of his own pocket. 88
88 for the reason that they considered the use of a Government yes- 88
88 eel for such purposes wrong.
88 It Is doubted whether there is any fund out of which the ex- 88
88 penses of the trip could belaid except the unexpended balance of 88
88 the national defense fund; and it is contended it would be a grave 8S
88 breach of the confidence imposed in him by Congress if the Presi- 88
88 dent should consent that any Dart of this fund voted to put the na- 88
88 tlon in a condition of defense should be used to carry a lot of guests 88
88 of the Secretary of War on a pleasure trip through the West In- 88
88 dies. 5Â«
88 When I asked Representative Sulzer to-day whether he intended S
88 to accompany the Secretary of War. he said: "I have declined the *8
88 invitation. I have no further comment to make, except to say that 88
88 when I go to Cuba I will co on my own account and at my own 88
88 expense, and when I get there I will be the guest of the Cuban re- SiÂ»
88 public."

PIGGOTT AND HIS "PXTLL."
He Is Acquitted by a Jury of the
Charge of Vagrancy.
John Piggott, the notorious pickpocket,
and his "pull" hare scored another point
against the Police Department, as a jury
in Judge Graham's court yesterday after
noon found him not guilty of the charge
of vagrancy preferred against him by Po
liceman Barney Harter. Evidence was
given by Harter. Policemen Colen and
Butler and Detective Egan.
Unfortunately for the police, the testi
mony of Detective Egan and Policeman
Butler did not agree. The jurors who
heard the case were: Fred Bronson. S.

to arrive at a decision.
There is still another charge or va
grancy against Piggott and his compan
ion. Cal Childs, to be tried, and the two
are under indictment by the Grand Jury
on a charge of grand larceny. The police
think they have a sure case against them
on the grand larceny charge as the
"pull" will not be so potent in the fau

MYSTERY OF
A SUICIDE
Unknown Man Found
Dead in a Hotel.
"R. Brown, Fresno."
A MAN who registered as "R. Brown,
Fresno," at the Cosmopolitan Hotel
on the 16th committed 1 suicide in his
room yesterday.
Nothing is known of the man or his
connections, but it is believed that Brown
is not his real name, as the name R. Bar
ton was marked on his linen. He did not
leave a scrap of paper or anything alse
by which he might be identified, and the
proprietor of the hotel knows nothing
about him except that he appeared to be
in bad health and was somewhat despon
dent. He was apparently about 38 years
of ag-e and dressed like a man in moderate
circumstances, but made no friends.
The suicide was deliberate. The man
fastened a rubber tube to the gas jet and
inhaled the deadly fumes until life wai
extinct.
The body was taken to the Morgue,
where it now lies awaiting identification.

SLAYER OF HUNTER
HELD WITHOUT BAIL
JAY E. HUNTER.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 21.â William
H. Alford, who shot and killed Jay E.
Hunter on the fourth floor of the Stim
son block. on Saturday afternoon after
a quarrel over a srfall money matter,
was arraigned before Justice Morgan
this morning on a charge of murder,
the complaint being sworn to by Police
Officer McGraw. His examination was
set for Friday morning-, he being held
without bail.
Alford appeared in the dock before
a courtroom full of people, with his
head bandaged. He was nervous and
puffering great pain from the wounds
in his head, which Hunter inflicted with
his three-pound, silver-headed cane,
While he looked pale and careworn, he
was quite cheerful, and made a good
impression on the audience. He is a
much smaller man than Hunter, who
was an athlete. Alford is frail looking,
but has a determined face.
Considerable sympathy has been
aroused in behalf of Mford. Two
deputy constables and detectives have

SENATORS TALK
ON THE HULL BILL
Will Not Pass at This!
Session.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â Formal
discussion of the Hull-Hawley army re
organization bill was begun in the Sen
ate this afternoon. Hawiey and War
ren, Republicans, supported the meas
ure, and Mitchell and Cockrell, Demo
crats, opposed it, while Proctor (R.) ad
dressed the Senate in favor of some
amendments which he had proposed to
the bill. All the speakers are members
of the Committee on Military Affairs.
Cockrell's speech, though brief, was
particularly notable as he spoke defi
nitely for the opposition to the army
bill. He declared practically in so many
words that the Hull-Hawley bill could
not become a law at this session. He
and those who stood with him were
willing to give the President all the
money and every man he desired, but
they were determined that no great
standing army should be fastened upon
â  the country without full and free dis
cussion. The postofnee appropriation
bill was passed to-day, Butler of North
Carolina and Pettigrew of South Da
kota having concluded their speeches.
â¢ Soon after the Senate convened Pet
tigrew of South Dakota presented reso
lutions from the Legislature of South
Dakota urging the Senators of that
State to support the treaty of peace,
i 'ommentlng upon the resolutions Pet
tigrew said that he denied the right of
the Legislature to instruct him, al
though he was always glad to hear
from that body.
'The present Legislature r,f South
Dakota," said he, "is the third since I
was elected a Senator the last time. In
one a resolution was passed indorsing
the free and unlimited coinage of silver.
Both houses of the next Legislature
passed a similar resolution. The present
Legislature is in favor of the single
gold standard. If I should undertake
to follow the course laid down by the
Legislature I would be on almost every
side of almost every public question."

it was modined to meet this objection

ACCUSES THE
AMERICANS OF
BAD FAITH
BERLIN Feb. 21.â The Cologne Gazette to-day, in an inspired
article sharply criticizes the recently published letter addressed by
Chief Justice Chambers of Samoa to his brother. The paper says:
The facts of the situation are that Mataafa received five-sixths and
Malietoa Tanu one-sixth of the votes cast. The election was conducted in
strict accordance with Samoan customs. Malietoa Tanu was ineligible,
according to Samoan customs, as he is only eighteen years old. Mr. Cham
bers prior to the election, recognized Mataafa's eligibility. All these facts
Mr "'Chambers ignored when he declared Malietoa Tanu elected. His dec
laration that Mataafa was ineligible comes with particularly bad grace,
because it was the American delegates at the conference of IS9B who did not
admit Germany's objection to Mataafa.
The Cologne Gazette then declares it to be wholly untrue that the
German warship Falke supported Mataafa, The Falke, It says, was I
strictly neutral. The Cologne Gazette further says it is untrue that

SANTA CRUZ, Feb. 21.â The Grand

CALIFORNIA EGGS
SUPPLY CHICAGO
Not Enough to Meet the Demand,
and Prices Still Rule
High.
CHICAGO, Feb. 21.â The timely arrival
of three carloads of eggs from San Fran
cisco to-day prevented a hen fruit famine
in the Chicago market. As it was, the
consignment did not stop the putting up
of prices to the almost prohibitive mark
of 28 cents per dozen on the street, which
means 40 cents a dozen to consumers.
Other consignments are on the way from
San Francisco, some of which are ex
pected to-morrow, and it Is thought prices
will not go higher.
Owing to the recent cold wave which
swopt over the entire country eaÂ«t of the
Rockies, sources of supply usually drawn
on by the Chicago jobbers were cut off.
Hitherto the winter supply came from
[ Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, but for the
last four weeks the hens have been too
busy keeping warm, and jobbers were
forced to import stocks from California.
This is the first time in the history of the
Butter and Egg Exchange this has been
tried. The eggs stood transportation very
well, and when put on the market were
grabbed off quickly at the top notch
figures quoted above. Some doubt was ex
pressed by dealers to-day that California
dealers would be able to supply Chicago's
needs if the cold weather continued
throughout the Middle West, as this is the
Lenten season, when eggs are so exten
sively used in lieu of meats, and the de
mand for them therefore is greatly In
creased.

Produces a Sensation at
Rome.

THE NEEDS OF THE CHURCH IN
THIS COUNTRY.
Catholics "Will Read With Deep In
terest These Words From tha
Fountain Head of
Their Faith.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 22.â The Rome
correspondent of the Times says:
"Generally speaking, the ency
clical is regarded as a qualified
condemnation of the Hecker doc
trines. It would be Erroneous to
suppose that it condemns or di
rectly affects Cardinal Gibbons,
Archbishop Ireland or the group
of enlightened prelates who have
bo largely contributed to the
spread of Roman Catholicism in
the United States. v-'
"It is partly the outcome of a
deep-laid, long-matured intrigue,
and if this is the only result of
twelve months' plotting it is
clear that the latter will
strengthen rather than weaken
the position of the American pre
lates whom the intrigue was in
tended to overthrow.
"Throughout the bitter phases
of the bitter conflict which pre
ceded its publication the Pope
displayed a prudence and per
spicacity astonishing in a man of
his age placed in a position
where unbiased Information is
not readily forthcoming."
ROME, Feb. 21.â The Osservatore
Romano publishes to-night a letter from
the Pope to Cardinal Gibbons saying:
"If the term 'Americanism' signifies a
quality peculiar to Americans and
usages adapted to their customs, then
we have nothing to say against it; but
if it denotes the opinions expressed in
the 'Life of Father Hecker' we are con
vinced that the American Bishops will
be the first to reject them."
The Pope's letter especially reproves
opinions concerning the relaxation cf
discipline and the nou-observance of
doctrinal points as a pretext for at
tracting dissenters to Catholicism, the
direction of souls by inspiration of the
Holy Ghost, independent of priestly
control; the diversion of virtue into ac
tive or passive criticisms of the old re
ligious orders, and concerning unusual
methods of preaching Catholicism to
dissenters.
The letter, which occupies five col
umns in the Osservatore Romano, be
gins by lauding Cardinal Gibbons and
the American Catholics. Alluding to
the many proofs of good will he has
given them in the past, the Pope wishes
them to see in the present document
proof of his affection for America.
While he makes it clear that the let
ter is one of warning and correction
with reference to the "Life of Father
Hecker," his Holiness carefully dis
tinguishes between the doctrinal as
pects of the new theories and questions
of practical discipline and strongly
urges the impossibility of any change
in the former.
Whiie admitting the church has al
wÃys recognized and acted upon the
necessity of adapting certain points of
discipline to modern requirements, it
rests with the church, the Pope points
out, and not with individuals, to de
termine how and when such adapta
tions can be made.
"All virtues," says his Holiness,
"must necessarily be active. The con
tempt shown by innovators for what
they are pleased to call the passive
virtues has naturally led to a contempt
of religious life as suited only to the
weak and as an impediment to Chris
tian perfection and to the good of the
community."
This error the Pope energetically con
demns, declaring it "injudicious to the
religious orders and in contradiction to
history."
He reminds the Americans of their
indebtedness to the religious orders,
both active and contemplative.
The letter arouses deep interest In
Rome. The Liberal papers declare that
it constitutes a "solemn manifestation
of the intransigent spirit of Catholi
cism," and predict that it will produce
an immense effect in America.

SAMPSON HANGS
A DEAD WEIGHT
UPON DEWEY
Row in the Navy May Cause the
Manila Hero to Lose Deserved
Promotion.
NEW YORK, Feb. 21.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Rear Admiral Dewey may be
prevented from receiving the reward
of promotion to be an admiral to which
the country believes him to be entitled
by the unseemly squabble for pre
cedence that haa grown up between
Rear Admiral Sampson and Rear Ad
miral Schley. Chairman Boutelle of
the House Committee on Naval Affairs
has not taken any steps to have the bill
to revive the grade of admiral and vice
admiral brought up in his committee
and the indications are that he will not
do so.
When I asked him about it to-day he
said he knew nothing whatever about
the Senate bill, and if it was before his
committee he did not know it. He de
clined to discuss the suggestion that
the Senate bill was being held up in the
interest of Rear Admiral Sampson, but
gave me to understand very clearly that
he believed if the grade of admiral
should be revived the grade of vice ad
miral should be revived also.
I talked with several other members
of the committee, and it was apparent
that they concurred with Chairman
Boutelle In this vt*>"- and that the
house committee was determined that
no legislation should be enacted that
would permit the promotion of Rear
Admiral Dewp- 41 -~* did not carry with
it a provision for the promotion of
Rear Admiral Sampson. The whole
matter is in the hands of Chairman
Boutelle, the other members of the
committee say, and it is upon him,
therefore, that the responsibility must
rest if Congress fails to make provision
for a suitable reward of Rear Admiral
Dewey.
Friends of Rear Admiral Schley in
the House declare that if Mr. Boutelle
persists in his determination to make
the provision for the revival of the
grade of Admiral conditional upon the
revival of the grade of Vice Admiral
also the bill will provide for two Vice
Admirals before it is passed, so that
Rear Admiral Schley will go up with
Rear Admiral Sampson.

manly defense of his conduct in the

BENCH CLAIMS
PROVING RICH
Many Located Along the
Porcupine.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Feb. 16 (via Van
couver, B. C, Feb. 21.). â Bench claims
are the latest from Porcupine. Ever
since the benches of the Klondike were
found so rich not a creek in Alaska,
British Columbia or the Northwest
Territory is prospected where gravel
from the side hills is not sacked, car
ried down to the water and panned.
This has been productive of some very
good surface prospects in the Tahkin,
a creek in the Porcupine district. Some
of these claims are in a basin and all
the indications are good. Discovery on
the Tahkin was staked on January 31,
and the country Is all pretty well lo
cated by this time. A good indication
that something is to be found in the
Porcupine district is the fact that men
continue to go in there and prospect in
the snow under the greatest difficulty
and with the greatest labor. The Tah
kin empties into the Chilkat about nine
miles from salt water. Its location,
whicÂ£ Is really on the trail to Porcu
pine, shows that no creeks in the re
gion are overlooked.
It looks as though not less than 1000
locations will be made in the Porcupine
country before the snow is gone, If the
present rate of travel continues, and
there is no sign that it will not. Re
ally few prospects are made, owing to
the great depth of the snow. If some
body shovels down through the snow,
burns out a hole in the gravel and
finds colors that is sign enough for all
comers. The whole creek is staked
on the snow. Many of the men have
powers of attorneys which they use in
making locations for friends, or for
anybody else, for a consideration. An
advantage of the Porcupine country is
that Haines Mission, Chilkat or Pyra
mid Harbor are close enough to be used
as a base of supplies. The Indians are

smirch his record, was the subject of
general comment among public men
here to-day. It has emphasized in the
most forcible manner what many Sen
ators and Representatives have be
lieved for a long timeâ that a deter
mined conspiracy has existed among
administration officials to discredit the
brilliant work of Admiral Schley at
Santiago to the advantage of Admiral
Sampson.
There is much indignation among
Senators interested in the controversy
concerning the promotion of the two
officers over the startling disclosure
Bhowing that either the Navy Depart
ment or Admiral Sampson willfully
kept from the correspondence prepared
to throw discredit on the work of Ad
miral Schley the letter of May 20 show
ing that he was obeying the order of
Admiral Sampson in remaining at Cien
fuegos.
There have been many inquiries from
Senators to-day as to the circumstance
attending the suppression of this letter.
At the Navy Department I was in
formed by an official who is acquainted
with the sentiments of the Secretary
and of the board which reported the
facts on which that official based his
communication to the Senate that it
was true it was not included in the
Secretary's letter nor in the appendix
to the report of the chief of the Bureau
of Navigation. In fact it had not been
transmitted to the department by Rear
Admiral Sampson or Rear Admiral
Schley.
"But even if the department had had
the letter," he continued, "it would
probably not have communicated it to
the Senate. That letter is merely an
amplification of the orders given to
Commodore Schley on May 19 directing
him to proceed to Cienfuegos and block
ade that port. As the order of May 19
was revoked by the order given to
Commodore Schley on May 21 directing
him to 'proceed with all dispatch, but
cautiously, to Santiago,' so was the or
der of May 20 which Commodore Schley
quotes, and in fact all orders prior to
the receipt of the order of May 21."
The publication of Admiral Schley's
statement has undoubtedly made him a
great many friends in the Senate. For
the sake of the good name of the navy,
however, I find there is a general dispo
sition to bring the controversy to an
end by confirming both officers to the
grades for which they have been nomi
nated by the President.
beginning to sled stuff for the pros
pectors.
At last accounts the thermometer
showed 20 degrees below zero and over
much of the country there is twenty
feet of snow. It is colder up in the
Chilkat country than in any other re
gion in Southeastern Alaska. To record
claims costs $2 50 at Haines Mission;
at Juneau $1 50. Scores are flocking to
Haines Mission from Skaguay. Juneau
is the last port of importance before
reaching Haines Mission and outfits can
be purchased here as cheap as at Se
attle, with the freight saved. Juneau
stocks are carried here for the purpose
of outfitting miners, and It may be to
the advantage of the public to know
that dealers who have been doing a
mining outfitting business for many
years know better what a gold seeker
needs and how to put it up than re
tailers of less experience. Small steam
ers run from Juneau to Haines Mis
sion. The large ships do not stop there,
as there are no docks.
A Skaguay lawyer found that many
claims on Pine and Spruce and other
creeks in Atlin were illegally located as
to dimensions, and otherwise. He had
them all remeasured and located at
considerable expense, intending to
jump them at the proper time and sell
them to the highest bidders at Skaguay
am! Atlin City. The exclusion act came
along, knocking the scheme in the head,
and the attorney is now looking around
for other worlds to conquer.
A good effect is already apparent
from the exclusion act. It is driving
newcomers and gold seekers who have
been waiting for weeks into American
territory back of Haines Mission, the
Porcupine and elsewhere to prospect
where a man may locate twenty acres
instead of 250 and 150 foot claims.

German Exporters Are Crowding Out

WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â Hon. God
frey Hunter of Kentucky, Minister of
! the United States to Guatemala and
I Honduras, arrived in Washington to
! day. Speaking to-night of the general
i depression in Guatemala, he says it is
1 due to the low price the coffee crop has
\ been bringing during the past two
! years. Dr. Hunter expresses the opin-
I ion that a matter which interferes with,
: our trade with Guatemala and other
' South American countries is the dis
' regard of our manufacturers for the
\ wishes of the people. The Germans se
cure the best of the trade, not because
their manufactures are any better, but
for the simple reason that they sell the
! people what they want and put it up
j for them as they want it shipped. Most
of the imported goods have to be
| shipped into the interior on pack trains.
i and the European manufacturer, ap-
I predating this, prepares his waTes suit

Sure Rupture Cure.
Remarkable and Convincing Evidence of the
Now Famous Rice Method and Its
Certainty to Cure.
An Aurora. Man's Experience and Recov-
ery Will Interest Anyone Afflicted
With Rupture.
More than twelve years ago a machinist In
the tool room of the C. B. & Q. R. R. shops at
Aurora, 111., met with an unfortunate acci-
dent causing a bad rupture. He was given ex-
pert medical treatment and used what was
considered a good truss, but no improvement
was noted. After frequent experiment* with
GEO. O. PLUMMER.
other trusses and treatments he grot hold of m
little pamphlet written by Dr. Rice of Adams,
N. T., and as It was a new idea the method
was tried and improvement began Immediately.
In a few weeks the sufferer, was entirely cured;
This happened twelve years ago and is now
given publicity In order to offset the popular
notion that a surgical operation is the only
way to cure ruiiture. Men and woman who
have been wearing trusses all their lives should,
write to Dr. Rice for particulars of his method.
He makes no charge for advice. The machinist
referred to above is Geo. O. Plummer. 388 La
Salle St., Aurora, 111., and a prominent mem-
ber of the Willard M. E. Church. . :
Mr. Plummer hasn't worn his truss for twelva
years and as his work in the railroad shops is
trying to his muscles his permanent cure of a
bad rupture is certainly sufficient to Interest
other unfortunates who are going through Ufa
In misery. Write to Dr. W. S. Rice, 418 P.

>TE7W YORK. Feb. 2Lâ The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: Not that the Canadian ne
gotiations have been. temporarily
! shelved. Secretary of State Hay -.i ex
| pected to push negotiations for the ab
rogation of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty.
Though the British Government nearly
two months ago stated its willingness
to abrogate the treaty, these negotia
j tions have lagged. Embassador Choate
i has been told the position of this Gov
ernment concerning" the treaty, and
when he reaches London, this will be
one of the important questions which
he will have to discuss with the Brit
ish Government.
There is a disposition in administra
tion circles to believe that the work of
the Joint High Commission is finished.
It is understood that Sir Wilfrid Lau
rier will ascertain from the Canadian
Parliament whether his refusal to ac
cede to the "exorbitant" demands of
the United States is acceptable.
An omcial ------ the American
commissioners had made every conces
sion possible; that an agreement had
been reached on several points only be
cause of their yielding, but that it was
impossible to accept the British sug
gestion regarding the Alaskan boun- i
dary. This matter may be settled by
se separate treaty, or perhaps by direct |
instructions to the commissioners' '
should they ever meet again, which de- I
pends largely on the attitude of the Ca- j
nadian Parliament with respect to the j
course pursued by Laurier and his col- j
leagues.

FOR MISS PERRY

Story.
Special Dtspatch to Tile CalL
= AN* JOSE Feb. 2Lâ Women crowded
Judgr? Kittredge's court to-day in the
j hope of hearing- some spicy testimony in
| the Crabb divorce suit. Their presence
\ gave a matinee air to the assemblage.
The cross-examination of Mrs. E. B.
! McClure was taken up at the opening
jof ctfurt. Dr. Crabb ha told her he
! had given his wfre a written confession
| that he loved Miss Perry, but had con
j fessed. only in fun.
Mrs. J. C. Zuck of Gilroy was the
next witness. Dr. Crabb told her his
j wife was not in her ri?ht mind. She
j had never heard Mrs. -abb say any
j thins- against her husband. Attorney
I Hasaett asked the witness if Dr. Crabb
i had not told her Mrs. Crabb was of no
| earth rose to him as a wife. Strenu
j ous objection â â â -.- ques
! tion.
Dr. Crabb said his wife, when In her'
i right mind, was pure and chaste; at
other times she was very obscene and
said things she ousrfat not to.
Mrs. Hattie Crabb, the defendant.
I was then called to the stand. She said
| she was married to Dr. Crabb in UK- j
i nois. Her story showed that from the
first her life had been one of hard work
and in later years made sorrowful by
lack of attention. She and her husband
came to California, in IST4. He ob- !
tamed a place for her in a inilllnery i
store and she at once wen: 10 work.
They lived in various place*?. In IS9I
he came to the University of the Pa- â 
cific and her troubles then began in I
earnest. He paid too much attention to
the Misses Bessie and Anns. Mayne,
teachers at the place, and Mrs. Crabb
objected. Th- witness had received
anonymous notes in regard to her hus
tand's actions from students. She had
never accused her husband of Improper
relations with any one. Mr Crabb
defied that she had ever struck her
husband on the back with a bowl
thrown a knife at him, or otherwise
abused him.
Dr. Crabb's fondness for Miss Carrie
Terry was gone over, and she told prac
tically the same story the fjrmer wit
nesses related. Dr. Crabb. she said,
made frequent visits to San Francisco
to Fee Miss Perry. Mr* Osbome jan- i
itor of the GOroy church, and Dr. j
Crabb had been found holding- each j
others hands and gazing- I.m-ing-ly at
each other. Dr. Crabb confessed 'to the
witness that he loved SCijts Ferry. He
said God had given him something to
love, and it was an especial act of di
vine providence that threw them to
g-ether. He said he might marry her
some time. Her husband also ' gave
her a written confession to this effect.
In it he declared he loved Miss Perry
but that their relations had not been
improper.
A copy of this confession was pro- :
duced. The original, the witness said,
had been destroyed by the doctor. The
question of admitting the copy was not
settled at the hour of adjournment. ;
Mrs. Crabb will resume her story on
Thursday morning-.

THE SAX FRANCESCO CAIX, WEDXESPA" FEBBUABY 22, 1899.
EMBALMED BEEF CAUSED
MUCH OF THE SICKNESS
IN THE CUBAN CAMPAIGN
Charges Made by General Mis Are Borne Out
by the Testimony of tfoy Officers
of the Amy
WASHINGTON. Feb. 21. â The court I
of Inquiry ec.ga.gad in investigating' the
beef charges preferred by General
Mile 3 continued to-day the hearing- of .
testimony bearing? upon the contro
versy. A number of army officers who
participated in the Santiago campaign.
were heard. Practically without ex
ception the oÂ£lcer3 condemned the
canned roast beef furnished as a travel
ration and reviewed complaints about
it which the men very generally made,
declaring it unpalatable and wanting
in nutriment.
On the other hand, the refrigerated
beef suffered but little at the hands of
to-day*3 witnesses, it being generally
conceded that it was good when deliv
ered from the transports and when it
escaped the decomposing effect of the
tropical sun en route to the several
commands it was found to be satisfac
tory. Difficulty in preventing taint be
fore cooking was experienced generally.
There was very little in to-day's testi
mony pointing to the use of chemicals
on this beef-
The contention of General Miles that
the army in Cuba and Porto Rico
should have been supplied with herds
of cattle, or beef on the hoof. instead
of refrigerated beef was supported by
every witness who to-day gave opinion
upon this question.
A feature of to-day's examinations
was the general assertion of witnesses
that they would not have felt it their
duty to the men or the army organiza
tion to have made any special report
upon â â - beef had it not been for the
special orders calling --.-â 
--but rather would have permitted the
unsatisfactory ration to pass without
further notice as an incident to war
fare â¢nd to the peculiarly trying con
ditions with which the army was con
fronted at the outbreak of the war. A
number of offlcers testified to the belief
that a very small proportion of sickness
in Cuba was due to the beef or un
wholesome rations, but rather to the
climate.
The session began with Colonel William
H. Powell at the Seventh Infantry, who
was stationed at Madison barracks at the
outbreak of the war. on the stand. He
said he started for Tampa April 13 with
a month's rations and did not come into
contact with the food from the Commis
sary Department
â¦ * â * Â» at Tampa, until

â¦ 4 â Â»Â» quartered In th<
city he received
requests '- â -:Â» men for money to buy
food to eat. He investigated the so-called
canned" roast beef and had some of it
served at his own table.
â¢*I could not eat It.** he continued. "It
was a stringy, unwholesome looking mass,
more like wet seawÂ»<?d than anything el3<Â»
I can think of. The men were sick and
debilitated and could not keep It on their
stomachs. W<Â» had at that tlm<Â» 2 sick.
Soon after that the fresh beef began to
arrive and the - - - ate readily and began
to pick up in health. Afterward we were
moved out of camp to a point near the
San Juan battlefield. Here much of our
meat spoiled before we coald get it."
Resrardlnx the refrigerated beef Colonel
Powell said there was little to be said
against it. except that some of it spoilt
before it was received. There were no fa
cilities for cooking while tn the city ex
cept a fire in the gutter, and all food had
to be boiled. The regiment was very hard
worked while in the city, eighty-nine be
injr on guard duty daily. Some of these
were so sick that they fell down at their
posts and had to be brought in. The wit
ness thought the men would be better of 1
in the country, and he directed his ener,
gies toward getting them out of tow
rather than to reporting on the cpiaiit.
of rations. He had tried to get bettf*
quarters, but failed, and tried to get.metf
ical assistance to help his own contra!

You may const on ray firm desire to dedi

of my unchanged devotion to the republic.
The rejrular transmission of power, ac
complished in a few hours after the sud
den, death of our beloved and resrretted
President, Felix Faure. has afforded in
the eyes of the whole world fresh proof
of the fidelity of France to the republic j
at a time when some misiruided men are
seeking to shake the confidence of the
country in its institutions. The National
Assembly plainly signified on Saturday
Its --ire to bring- about the pacification
of men*3 minds and to re-establish and
make lasting the union of all Republicans.
Passionately devoted to the principles \
of the French revolution and the regime
cf liberty, It will be my constant anxiety
to assist Parliament in this necessary
work of tolerance and concord. During
the course of the temporary difficulties
through which we have passed, France, j
by her sang- frotd and dignity and the
patriotism of her Parliament, has grown
in the esteem of the new world. Why, j
then, may we not hope for a similar un
derstanding in internal affairs? Does not
this underitandin? exist in the country?
Is there the least doubt of necessity for
paying equal respect to the essenual or
gans of societyâ the chamber which de
: liberates freely on the laws, the magis
tracy which applies them, the Govern
; men? which insures their execution and
the atonal army which safeguards the
r endence and integrity of the mother- !
land-that army which the country loves
â  and which It is right in tob^teoat
the whole nation fulfills lit It the same
duty of self-denial and discipline and

Following General Hawkins, Captain J.
, W. Duncan of the Twenty-first Infantry
was inrtodticed. Canned roast beef, ac
; cording to his recollection, was issued as
j ' a travel ration at

- - !â â â¢;-â  - as a travel ratios
on the home voyage. It did not. he said,
give general satisfaction, the men gen-
I erally complaining. He saw much of It
opened, and it appeared coarse, insea- j
soned, tasted fiat, wa3 la long strips, and '
the grease, "or whatever It was," was in g
globules. Apparently it was preserved i
well. Coraplaints brought to him. he said,
were that the beef was repugnant and un
palatable. It was first eaten, out of the
can. and subsequently was cooked in a
stew form in tomato cans and camp ket
tles,- and in this latter form was more
satisfactory. He heard no complaints on
the return trip.
Captiin William N. Hughes. Thirteenth ,
Infantry, was with his command during j
its stay at Tampa, and in the Santiago
campaign until July 10, when he was
stricken with yellow fever. Canned roast
beef, he said, was first used after the ;
1 landing, and complaints followed at once. â¢
He attempted personally, he said, to use
It* but found it unpalatable. It did not
satisfy hunger, and he could not eat it.
Such was the experience generally of the
men. It was stringy and Had no nutritive
value. : -
Captain William Ennis. Fourth Artil
lery, was with the Shafter expedition,
and remained at Santiago until .gust
14. He said the canned roast beef was
used on the transport and more or less
throughout the stay of his command in I
Cuba- None of tin? men complained while '
there, but personally he had taJsen it a3
a stew and was often nauseated. Since
his return he had inquired of the men as
.to Its effect, and complaints were made.
He took no action about it in Cuba, be
cause he heard of no notable complaint 3
and did not consider action, necessary.
Refrigerated, beef, was furnished after the
surrender and was satisfactory- Every
body, he said. liked it. and he never sus
pected any use of chemicals. Since he
had reflected, he was surprised that he
had been able to keep it twenty-four
hours after issue.
"A great many of the men would eat
the canned roast beef and turn about
quickly and vomit," said Captain Ennis. ;
"and. finally they refused to eat it at all."
Thl3 was said in response to i question
as to the causes of Illness among his
troop. Captain Ennis believed much of It
was due to this beef. No other food
caused vomiting immediately after eating, !
he said, but the sickness was only tran- |
sient.
Major Stephen Baker, retired, attached
to the Fourth Infantry during the San- '
tiago campaign, said canned roast beef
was issued after landing and until after
the surrender, and complaints of no very
specific character were ma generally by I
! the men and captains. No definite at- ;
i tempt to remedy the defects In the rations
was made, he said, because all realized
that -ie best possible was being done
under the circumstances and they were
glad to get anything.

eral Sumner said he attributed none of I
thÂ» stcTcnesa to defective food.
Major Jesse M. Lee, Ninth Infantry,'
who joined his regiment at Santiago July
29, said refrizerated beef was furnished,
seemingly daily, and frequently spoiled
before it could be got to camp two miles â¢
from tie city.' Much dlfilculty in trans
porting It wa3 experienced, and. aside
from putrefaction, there appeared little

MADRID, Feb. Zl.âln the Chamber
of Deputies to-day the opposition con- '

Canalejas put a long- string of ques- j.
tions to the Minister of Finance, Senor j
Puigrceiver. who declined to reveal the j

Minister, however, said he hoped in due

To this Senor Canalejas replied: j
"Nothing could be conceived more la- j

has prepared no bills at all. despite the j

Senor Canalejas then proceeded to i

MRS. YOUNG ON
TRIAL FOR ARSON
Excitement Runs High
at San Rafael.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Feb. 21.â trial of
Mrs. Augusta Young of Tiburon on a
charge of arson, which began in. the
Superior Court to-day, has developed
into a feud of bitter character- It is :
alleged that in three separate instances
determined attempts have been made
to intimidate three leading witnesses
for the prosecution and the feeling runs
so high, that not a male witness was
permitted to take the stand without
first being searched by Sheriff Taylor
to* see If he carried deadly weapons.
None were found and the trial proceed
ed, but it was plain to see that the
nerves of all the principal witnesses
were tense, and that it would have
taken little to precipitate a fracas.
Miss Matilda Lutzone. the principal
witness for the prosecution, was dis
charged from the employ of Mrs. Linn
at Tiburon yesterday, and it is alleg-ed
by the other witnesses for the prose
cution that this was done because she
testified against Mrs. Young- at the pre~
limlnary examination and would not
refuse to appear in the Superior Court-
While William Lewis, another wit
ness? was attending the trial to-day he
was 'telephoned that Thomas Mitchell,
the partner of Young, had tried to
break â¢in the door of the bam owned
by Lewis to take away a horse whose
ownership seems to be in. doubt.

THE VALLEY ROOD WORK-
WHILE the dry weather causes something of
delay in business, and the Legislature dawdles
in a Senatorial deadlock, and progress gener
erally seems blocked, it is gratifying to note that in
some directions, and in some enterprises at least,
work is going forward with vigor ajid energy, and
the conditions of the State are being changed for the
better.
' One of the movements which we can watch with
satisfaction is that of completing the link in the Val
ley road to connect Point Richmond with Stockton.
The work on that part of the line is difficult and toil
some, but nevertheless it is going forward with com
mendable rapidity. Recent reports are to the effect
that the debris of the late slide in the big Franklin
tunnel has been cleared away and the tunnel toward \
Concord is nearly finished. It is expected the tunnel j
near Pinole will be completed in three months, and
that the cut and fill near Rodeo Creek will be finished
about the same time.
With each successive accomplishment in the work j
San Francisco and California are brought nearer and
nearer to the attainment of that competing trans
continental system of railroad which has been so long
desired and which promises to be of such far-reaching j
benefit to the trade and industry of both the city and j
the State.
It now the Southern Pacific Company would ful
fill its oft-repeated promise to cease its efforts to j
dominate the politics of the State and devote its ac- j
t:\ities to the completion of the gap in the Coast j
road, the railroad outlook of the commonwealth
would be sufficiently auspicious to counterbalance to
some extent the depressing prospects elsewhere.
As a matter of fact there should be some means of
..compelling the Southern Pacific Company to fulfill
'.hs pledges to the people from whom it obtained!
rights of way across the gap in the coast line. The
land was granted upon the express understanding
that the work of building the road should begin at I
once and be completed in time to give persons who j
were then living an opportunity to get some of the
benefits expected to result from it. The years have
passed, the company holds on to the rights of way,
but the work of construction goes slowly, and the
coast counties between San Francisco and Los An
geles remain sidetracked while the Southern Pacific
is doing tunnel politics.
In the meantime the construction of the gap in the
Valley road is going briskly forward. The whole
course of this great enterprise is from first to last one
that the people can regard with more than ordinary
satisfaction. The contrast between that business man
agement and the political meddling and muddling of
the Southern Pacific is too striking and impressive
to require any comment to make it understood by the
people. ;

ThjE INTERESTS OF THE PARTY.
HAD the Southern Pacific Company any patriotic
regard for the welfare of California it would
never have lent its aid to advance Dan Burns
in politics after his record had been once exposed;
| had it any respect for the dignity of the United States
I Senate it would never have proposed him for election
to that body, even if it accepted his services in other
ways; had it any consideration for political decency
it would never have tried to force him upon a party
whose campaign pledges were emphatic assertions
that the railroad is out of politics; were it at all wise
it would not now persist in upholding him, since it
j has been made clear that his candidacy arouses popu
| lar indignation, and that the Republican majority in
the Legislature will never support it.
The candidacy of Burns, shamelessly promoted by a
| corrupt corporation, is offensive to every principle
which honest Republicans hold dear. It is a wrong to
the reputation of the State, an insult to the National
Senate, a mockery of the people, a violation of ex
press pledges, a degradation of genuine Republican
ism and a menace of future disaster.
It is as certain as anything can be the election of
Burns by Republican votes would heavily handicap
the party in California for years to come. It would
be a disgrace to the State perpetrated under circum
stances of a most aggravating nature. It would im
ply that every Republican in the Legislature who
made his canvass last fall on the distinct pledge that
railroad domination was to be eliminated from the
State was lying at the time, or is of so weak a man
| hood that he is willing to accept in office the domina
j tion which he denounced while a candidate.
The record of California Republicanism is so hon
! orable for faithful service well performed the party
can survive any ordinary blunder on the part of its
representatives in office and retain popular confidence
in its honesty and patriotisjn. It will not easily surmount,
however, a deliberate betrayal of the State into the
control of the railroad and the election of the dirtiest
politician in California to the United States Senate
to succeed Stephen M. White.
The issue is one of sufficient importance to arouse
!to activity every loyal Republican in the State. If the
| railroad be permitted by a caucus, or by any other
means, to bring about the election of Dan Burns,
then in the next election, when some great policy of
protection or sound money is at stake, the victory
may go to the party of financial folly simply because
the triumph of Burns will have disgusted the people
with Republicanism.
Better will it be for the Republicans of the Legis
lature to elect no Senator at all than to elect Burns.
A drawn battle is better than submission to dishonor.
Genuine Republicans should stand fast to the great
principles of the party and to the pledge that the
Southern Pacific shall no longer dominate California.
On that ground there may be a drawn battle this
time, but in the end there awaits a sure and trium
phant victory.
THE ISLE OF PINES.
REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that it has been determined by the administra
tion to annex the Isle of Pines and hold it as
a permanent possession of the United States, no mat
ter what disposition may be made of Cuba. As the
island has always been regarded as an adjunct of
Cuba and was so treated by the Spaniards, this de
cision may involve us in some controversy with the
Cubans in case we recognize their independence and
withdraw our troops from their shores.
The reason assigned for the reported decision is
that the geographical situation of the island with
reference to Nicaragua renders it of strategic impor
tance. It is south of Cuba, and the routes of vessels
passing to and from the Nicaragua canal when com
pleted will be virtually commanded by it. As a point
of vantage in naval operations it is said to be much*)
superior to Porto Rico, and will be the best location
in the West Indies for a fortified post and naval sta
tion.
The argument for its annexation is certainly strong,
and yet it cannot be denied the Cubans have good
grounds for claiming it as part of their territory. It
is virtually as much a part of Cuba as Key West is a
part of Florida. It is connected with the main island
by a chain of keys so nearly complete and separated
by such shallow water that it is said cattle have been
known to pass from- one to the other.
Our right to hold it, even if we evacuate Cuba, is
based upon that clause of the tieaty of peace which
declares Spain cedes to the United States the island
of Porto Rico and other islands now under Spanish
sovereignty in the West Indies. We have, therefore,
a good title to the island, as, indeed, we have to Cuba
itself if we choose to exercise it.
The issue is one over which there is not likely to
be much dispute in this country, whatever the Cuban
patriots may think about it. When we construct the
Nicaragua canal it will be of the highest importance
to us to control the routes to the waterway along
both the Pacific and the Atlantic coast. There will be
nothing of imperial expansion in holding this com
paratively small island, which will afford a safe and
healthful station for our fleets that may be called upon
to guard the passage to the canal. Nor is there any
sound reason why the Cubans should object to its
occupation by us. We would not be there as a
menace, but as a protection to their republic and a
I gu;Md for their commerce as well as our own.

Michael had been married and divorced. What

appear, and later he was charged with battering his

part of a gentleman to take to his heels rather than
blacken the eye of mature beauty even in self-defense.
Michael was arrested, as he should have been, but
v.hen his case was called the prosecuting witness
blushingly announced that hostilities were at an end.
Pressed for an explanation, she further stated that
she had married her son-in-law.
Probably there was no better way out of the
trouble. The courts are relieved, the power to punish
placed in the untrammeled hands of the bride, a
curious and interesting condition of relationship set
up, and Michael and his bride entitled to credit for es
tablishing a precedent. We congratulate the happy
pair, and hope they may live happily ever afterward.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1899.
THE legfl argument against the acquisition and
retention of the Philippines has been clearly
broup !.* home to the American people. It rests
both on principle and upon irrefragable authority.
That a government, existing only under the consti
tution, could acquire possessions, to which the con
stitution would not extend or exclusive of its sanc
tions, is a proposition that American babes and suck
lings are too intelligent to entertain. That either a
rule for imperial colonization or the right to absorb
Asiatic territory and barbarous and mongrel popula
tions can be found in the constitution, expressly or by
implication, is purely an invented falsehood.
But upon the score of policy alone, as distinguished
from the constitutional argument, the attitude of the
United States toward these revolutionary schemes, un
less a national somersault is achieved, is definite and
unalterable. The argument for the purchase of Flor
ida was put by John Quincy Adams on the ground of
contiguity, and even as to contiguous and desirable
territory, accretion and not colonization was specifi
cally declared to be its purpose. It was Thomas Jef
ferson, isolated passages from whose writings have
been so strung together by expansionists as to be
converted into virtual forgeries, who in his inaugural
of 1801 warned our people against "entangling alii
ances." This great statesman and founder of the
Democratic party, canonized in all parties, while he
realized the necessity of acquiring Louisiana and an
outlet to the Gulf of Mexico, as a measure of defense
and to promote commercial development, nevertheless
believed that to legalize its purchase and to avoid the
creation of a dangerous precedent, an amendment to
the constitution was essential. On April 27, 1809, he
wrote to James Madison on the question of expan
sion by the peaceable acquisition of Cuba: "Nothing
should ever be accepted which tfould require a navy
to defend it." December 2, 1823, James Monroe, who
formalized the Monroe doctrine, .thich had been pro
posed by Jefferson and approve*! by Canning, the
British statesman, in his seventh sanual message em
ployed this language: "With the listing colonies or
dependencies of any European pouar we have not in
terfered and shall not interfere." In 1845 President
Polk in his first annual message reikliated the inten
tion of acquiring territory by conqu^it. December i,
1852, Edward Everett, addressing tli Spanish Minis
ter in relation to Cuba, defined "ge graphical prox
imity" and '"extension in this hemisphere" as limiting
any possible desire of the United State; -for expansion.
Writing to the President July 4, 1870, Mr. Fish, Sec
retary of State, in relation to our natinal sympathy
for revolutions in America against Span, which com
menced in 1810, put it on the ground "the new
states were, like ourselves, revolted c tonics," and
claimed that "this policy is not a polkAof aggres
sion." The same accomplished diploma%, address
ing Sir Edward Thornton, in his officaj capacity,
April 8, 1873, disclaimed any desire to a-^ex Hayti
because "the policy of the Government, as iclared on
many occasions in the past, has tended toviyd avoid
ance of possessions disconnected from the ti&in con
tinent." The ground of Mr. Seward's fi;-> against
French intervention in Mexico, as is well knArn, was
the application of the Monroe doctrine, wich ex
cluded" imperial conquests on this continent, v|ile re
stricting the United States from interferen|[ with
European powers in other parts of the worf On
these lines, and in allusion to our southern ne&bor,
June 21, 1881, Mr. Blame, Secretary of Sta^ ex
pressed the settled policy of the Government: "o| late
years the American movement toward fixhr' of
boundaries and abstention from territorial enlargttlent
has been so marked and so necessarily a part o^the
continental policy of the American republics that any
departure therefrom becomes necessarily a menace to
the interests of all." In February, 1884, Mr. Freliig
huysen, Secretary of State, again declining to entjf
tain Haytian proposals, indorsed the unbroken set i
ments of his predecessors: "A conviction that a fixed
dating back to the origin of our constitution^
government was considered to make it inexpedient ti
attempt territorial aggrandizement, which would re
quire maintenance by a naval force in excess of any
yet provided for our actual uses, has led the Govern
ment to decline territorial acquisitions." In his first
inaugural President Cleveland in speaking of San Do
mingo said: "Maintaining as I do the tenets of a line
of precedents from Washington's day, which pro
scribed entangling alliances with foreign states, I do
not favor a policy of acquisition of new and distant
tenitory or the incorporation of remote interests with
cur own." And September 7, 1885, Mr. Bayard, Sec
retary of State, and afterward Embassador to Great
Britain, asserted that "the policy of the United States,
declared and pursued for more than a century, dis- j
countenances and in practice forbids distant colonial
acquisition."
These brief extracts, to which hundreds of other
quotations from State papers, not excluding those of
Presidents Harrison and McKinley, could be added,
are all the emphatic voice of this Government under
administrations which represented every national
party since the end of the last century. They denounce
and reject acquisitions by conquest and acquisitions
through negotiations or purchase, unless on this
continent, contiguous and essential to the natural
growth of the country. They treat even the islands
of the Caribbea- Sea as beyond the scope of oor
rational ambition, regulated by our constitutional
obligations. They fail to sanction any territorial an
nexation except under and through the constitution
and with the purpose of constructing and admitting
American States. They demonstrate the abandon
ment of constitutional principles and the willful per
version of facts by the expansionists, who advocate
either imperial colonization or territorial enlargement
in Asia. Whatever novelties, based upon their own
views of expediency, they may employ in their effort
to gull the American people, they cannot rely either
on law or history. If projected revolution, based on
deliberate violations of the constitution arid of uniform
practice, does not embrace the elements of treason, to
what milder phraseology can it be wedded? To de
clare the constitution "a back number," to assert that
we "have outgrown it," to anathematize great jurists,
great statesmen and great constitutional writers as
"old grannies," to speak of nailing our flag to the
rotten mast of despotism, to deride the Declaration of
independence and the facts and the sentiments that
embody the results of American development and of
American civilization, to speculate, in the face of our
common schools, upon the ignorance of the Ameri
can people and to seek to lure them to their own de
struction, to blot out their successful and cemented
victory over European despotism may be endured
while Burns and Grant struggle together in the womb
of political debauchery, but while manhood, honor
and American fraternity survive it is to deserve if not
to invite the fate of Haman.

EQUITABLE GAS
COMPANY IS IN
FULL OPERATION
Annual Meetingof the
Directors.
REPORTS OF THE OFFICERS
SURPRISING RESULTS ACCOM
PLISHED DURING THE YEAR.
Company Organized, Plant Erected
and Manufacture of Cheap Light
and Fuel Already in
Progress.
The promise of genuine competition In
gaslight made by the Equitable Gaslight
Company has been fulfilled. The first an
nual meeting of the stockholders was
held yesterday afternoon In the company's
new offices. 516 California street, formerly
occupied by the Spring Valley Water
Company. A large number of stockhold
ers were In attendance, 156,000 shares out
of a total of 170,000 being represented, and
much enthusiasm was displayed over the
flattering prospects of the new company.
Charles L. Ackerman, the president,
welcomed the stockholders to the first
annual meeting of the Equitable Gaslight
Company, and said: "Every promise
made to you has been fulfilled. One year
ago to-day thin company was incorporated
for the purpose of manufacturing gas by
a new and simple process. Our sincerity
of purpose was doubted by many, and we
were bitterly antagonized by our rivals
from the first. But with a small paid in
capital to compete with the old estab
lished company having the confidence of
all, we have gone ahead until to-day we
are actively in the field, supplying cus
tomers with a better and cheaper illum
lnant than they have ever had before."
He spoke of the delays in getting cer
tain material from the East, as well as
the necessity of selecting a suitable site
for a plant, but notwithstanding those
drawbacks, and with their limited capital,
in eight months' time they were ready to
begin the manufacture of gas. The situa
tion of the plant at North Beach was
like the handle of a fan, from which di
verge the great lines of mains to every
part of the city. He continued:
The labor has been given to California in
dustry, with the exception or steel Bhells and
gas holders, which were procured from the
East. The plant has been erected with a
capacity larger thÃn contemplated when start
ing, which was then believed would be 3,000,
--iÂ».Â»> cubic feet in twenty-four hours, but as
a matter of fact the plant has a capacity
fully one-third larger than that.
A demonstration of the manufacture of the
gas was made on December 13, 1898, to the
stockholders of the company, and on that day
gas was made and put into the holders at
the rate of nearly 4000 cubic feet per minuteâ
a feat never before accomplished, as by the
ordinary method of manufacturing coal or
water gas it would take six times ac long
to make as much gas with a similar sized
plant.
The principal purpose of the company is to
supply gas for fuel, and happily in addition to
that it makes the best Illuminating gas that
haÂ« ever been seen In San Francisco. The
Idea of having fuel in gaseous form for domes
tic uses and for all purposes of manufacture
has been dominant in the minds of progressive
gas makers for the past twenty-five years,
and although millions of dollars have been
expended In the effort to make a gas hot
enough to be used as fuel and yet economical
enough to compete with coal, the efforts have,
In every Instance, been entire failures.
"We do not measure our business by what has
been done by the other gas companies of San
Francirco. Our purpose is to displace the use
of coal as fuel Rnd make this gas take its
place for all purposes for which it (coal) and
other fuels have heretofore been used. The
scope and extent of this business can hardly
be conceived at the present time.
It was stated that our plant would never
be built within the time contracted for it â but
it is standing on the old Selby smelting site,
a living reality. It was also stated that if
the plant was constructed no gas would ever
be made by this process; but it was made in
the presence of stockholders at the rate of
4000 cubic feet per minute. The charge was
further made that the gas would stratify and
not run 100 feet through the mains. It was
practically demonstrated that it runs 10,000
feet from the works at North Beach to the
intersection of Market and Stockton streets,
and it runs and furnishes light to 95 per cent
of all the storekeepers along the line of Stock
ton street to Market, and the lÂ«-inch mains
now being but into Orant avenue will serve
to supply the customers of the company along
that street and all intersecting streets down to
the city front.
The last argument put forth by the enemies
ff this process is that it will consume twice
the quantity of the gas for the same amount
cf light per hour. Such a charge is hardly
I verth of refutation, and repeated tests have
! I sen made showing the mendacity of this state
( nent. Two miles from the works and in the
I irepence of a number of gas experts and board
! ( f directors a test was made at a prominent
llace with four different Welsbach burners,
the result being as follows:

Dr. J. W. Chisholm, vice president of
the company, addressed the memhCTs, ex
plaining the necessity for a cheaper fuel
for steam and heating purposes than coal,
and comparing the results obtained from
the new process of manufacturing goa
with those of coal.
"The enterprise which this company
represent? h;is such great possibilitiesâ
the field for it is so extensive, the bene>
fits it offers to the people at large, so
apparent and far-reaching and the profit
and prosperity which its energetic prose
cution Insures to all its members so sat
isfactory, hat there may be a slight ex
cuse for the blind*and obstinate increduli
ty of some of Its detractors and slander
ers, as well as for their groundless mis
statements.'
The secretary then read his report,
showing the cost of construction of the
plant and the disbursements made by the
company. The report showed that seven
miles of mains have been laid, and that
there Is now being laid a 18-inch main
along the line of Grant avenueâ intending
to supply that street and connections
both to the city front on the east and
Powell street on the west.
The report further showed that five
year contracts had been made with 3379
consumers, and that service pipes and
meters were being put in as fast as pos
sible, and although work has been in
progress but a few days a large number
of services have been put in and numer
ous customers connected and supplied
with gas. , . , -

FREE LIBRARY
FOR SOLDIERS
Colonel Miley Hopes to
Have One at Manila.
T IEUTENANT COLONEL, J. D. MILKY, tT. B. A., who li Bfcortljr to pail
for Manila, will, when he arrives there. Inaugurate a scheme that will
be of the greatest benefit and pleasure to the soldifrs whn are defend-
J â / ing the Stars and Stripes in a foreign land, and whose pleasures are
few The scheme that Colonel Miley proposes to put in operation is to have
for the soldiers a free circulating library. It is his own idea, and he has
quietly discussed it with his friends. It has met with the approval of every
one with whom he hns talked. Colonel Miley said yestorday that he had
received material assistance from the Red Cross, and that others had also
assisted him. It is known that the Loyal Legion is interested in the scheme
of securing the library for the soldiers.
Colonel Miley has at present Borne funds on hand and also contributions.
He does not know just fit present exactly how he is going to operate the li
brary, but it is his Intention to secure a building for the purpose and run
the library on the Mine linos that they are operated in this country. He
expects to take with him, when he goes, a sufficient basis in the shape of
books with which to begin tho library. The papers and magazines will
also be subscribed to, and Colonel Miley hopes that many pap. rs will be
donated to the library, as it is impossible to have too many of them.
He says that the idea of having a circulating library was first suggest
ed to him by the fact that all of the letters received from the soldiers in
the Philippines complain of the scarcity of reading matter, and thnt rill the
soldiers have to read is what is sent them by friends and the contribu
tions of files of newspapers made by the papers. Colonel Miloy hopes to
arouse Interest in his scheme before he sails, as he would like to take
with 'him as large a supply of reading matter as possible.

meeting adjourned.
The directors met immediately after and
re-elected the present officers.
The new gas company occupies the en

main floor being devoted to the counting
room and for the display of gas stoves
of every description, metenÂ» and other
appliances. The upper floors are used By
the officers and directors, while the base

NAVAL MILITIAMEN

Among the Guests â War
ship in Gala Attire.
Last night the United States ship Ma
rion, at her berth, Howard Street Wharf
No. 3, was bright with decorations, ban
ners and electric lights, the occasion for
the gala attire being the reception ten
dered by the men of the three divisions
of the Naval Militia, N. G. C, stationed
on board of her, to the officers of the
militia and other officers of the National
Guard, the officers and men of the lowa
and other friends of the men.
Canvas was spread overhead from stem
to stern, and to protect the visitors from i
the cool night air there was stretched all ',
around, from rail to upper canvas, sails j
which kept out the wind and made the !
vessel as pleasant as any ballroom. With
in there were dozens of potted plants ar
ranged on the decks, where they would j
appear to the best advantage, and the
foliage of green was set off by a liberal i
display of American flags, naval signals,
streamers and code signals, the latter be
ing arranged to read, "Welcome to the
men of the lowa."
At the front of the bridge on the poop j
deck there was displayed within the folds
of the Stars and Stripes, arranged by the
ship's, electrician, the initials, "N. M.,
N. G. C," in electric lights, and the re- !
flection of these fell upon a rapid-fire gun ;
surrounded by stacks of rifles, cutlasses i
and signals grouped with tasteful effect.
The beauty of the decorations . was
heightened by just enough electric lights
to show them off to advantage, and it was
the verdict of all who saw the pretty ar
rangement that the work of the tackles j
was deserving of a great deal of praise. |
About 700 invitations Were sent out and i
from the number of those who were on
board at the reception and promenade !
concert between the hours of 8 and 9 it
appeared that every one was . honored.
When the officers and men of the lowa
came on board they were received with j
a grand demonstration, not only by the
men of the ship, but by the civilians,
which must have convinced them that :
I San Franciscans admire the heroism of j
the men who faced the Spanish fire.
I After the visitors had enjoyed the con
cert music and inspected the ship above
and below there was dancing on the main j
and poop decks, the programme being in
terspersed with the rendition of negro
melodies by the Knickerbocker Male
Quartet and selections by the Golden Gate \
Musical Club. The dance programme in
cluded ten numbers, which kept the mer

CIGAR MAKERS REJOICING.
Objectionable Bevenue Buling Has
Practically Been Rescinded.
The cigar makers of this city are re
ioicing over a recent decision or ruling of
N B Scott, Commissioner of Internal
Revenue relative to dealers selling to
bacco in 'small quantities. Some time ago
he directed that dealers should not sell to
the manufacturers in quantities of less
than a bale, box or a package, and con
sidering that the original packages cost
from $200 up this ruling meant that tho
small cigar makers would have to shut up
S *StrenuouÃ efforts were made by the local
commercial bodies to have the ruling
modified, and the following dispatch from
Washington shows that the desired ob
ject has been accomplished:

- Louis Gimm, the six-day bicycle rider,
who â¢â â â said to be so seriously ill Sun
. day night after the race and Monday,
wa? reported to be much improved yes
â¢terday though there were symptoms of
â â  lypnoid fever developing.
-': , TV> Â° managers of the meet state that in
â¢their opinion Gimm's condition was great
... y exaggerated; that he unfortunately fell
. -Jcto the hands of a doctor who had never j
â had a case before and who was wise !
. enough to see in this one great possibili- j
ties. If he cured a man who was only
tired out from a long ride, little credit i
would result, whereas if he brought to j
life, a man who was almost at death's
door, from alleged "dope," enlarged heart. j
'/valvular expansion of the wishbone and j
other serious complaints, he would at
â¢once become famed as a physician and ;
taki.' his place among the eminent practl- ',
. tloners of the day. Hence the reason for !
\ the 'great mysteriousness about Gimm's
: room at the hotel, and the order forbid
ding any one to enter.
Nevertheless a Call reporter did man
, -age to see him yesterday, and found him
on the. fair read to recovery from his re- i
cent overexertion. His temperature is
. much lower and his pulse more regular,
and if no complications set in he will soon
be well again.
The other riders in the six-day race are I
up and about town, as fit as could be
- desired. They are all ready and anxious
to start In the big 24-hour race next Sat
â¢; urday night. None of them thinks any
one gave Gimm "dope." and all scout the
idea that such a trick was perpetrated.
The meet opens again to-night, the fea
ture of the evening's sport being a fifteen- !
â¢mile, match between Harry Elkea of New
York and Floyd McFarland of California, j
paced by twenty tandem teams. Both
â  men were at the track all day yester- '
day. practicing- pick-ups and speed be
hind the pacing machines, and from the
gait they maintained to-night's race
should be a speedy affair.
There will also be a tandem match race
between Downing and Cotter of Califor
nia and Eaton and Goodman of New
York, both champions in the tandem
class. A half-mile handicap will give the j
amateur riders a chance to show their
speed, and the professionals will be
brought together in a mile handicap. In
this latter event many of the men who
rode in the recent six-day race will com
. pete just to show that they are not yet j
"dead ones."
Teddy Halo, the Irish champion, is go- '
â¢ ing .home to the Emerald Isle in a tew j
â  -days. There will not be another long
distance race in America for another year,
and' as Teddy is only at his best in these
â events, and there is nothing else for him
to' do, he thinks he will go home until
â  next fall and come back for the next one
"then. .
' A Vie race meet will be held at San Jose
on the track of the Garden City Wheel
men o"n Saturday and Sunday. March 3
â¢ and 4, at which all of the Eastern men
â  will compete. They will then go to Fres
no and into Southern California, return- ]
ing- for a brief meet of a couple of days
.- here late in March before leaving for the .
East via Portland, Denver, St. Paul and j
â¢ Minneapolis.
"Dutch" Waller Is anxious to race Tom
Barnaby for 100 miles, paced, and as that
''is Barnaby 'a distance the match may be
â put on. Waller is particularly desirous
â  of showing his Oakland and Alameda 'â 
friends what he can do and how much he
is improved since he left there years ago.
It is not generally known that Four
hler rode a mile in 1:43 on the Pavilion
â â¢ track with his motor cycle last Satur
-â  day' night, in a pursuit race against a
tandem. Jimmy Michael and Harry Elkes
-caught the time and will bank on its cor
â¢ reetness. As the race itself lasted con
siderably more than a mile, the official
timers did not time the mile itself, but
the actual distance ridden, so they missed ,
this remarkable performance. It only |
goes to show the possibilities of the ma
chine when the Frenchman throws cau
tion to the winds. : ~ ;^.,
â  William A. Brady, one of the promoters
..-of the- big meet, left for the East last
'night. He was the recipient of many mes
sages of condolence yesterday on account
' df the loss of his boy. who died in New
York Monday night. Mr. Powers and Mr.
Kennedy, Brady's associates, will remain
â¢ hero for some little time.
Brady stated shortly before leaving that ;
hi. was so well satisfied with his recep- j
tion here that he would return next ;
vnrir.g and hold another race meet, bring
ing with him whatever new champions ;
are developed in the meantime.

THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1899.
DR. SHEPPARD
OUTFOOTED BY
FLEET DUNOIS
And Another Record
Broken.
THREE FAVORITES IN FRONT
GOTOBED BACKED OFF THE
BOARDS.
Eddie Jones Scored the First Time
Flamora Heavily Backed for
the Two-Year-Old Scramble.
The Pride ill Front.
Still another record -went, a-glimmering
at Oakland track yesterday. On Octo- !
ber 17, 1895, Mamie Scott, a scrawny look- j
Ing selling- plater, covered seven and a j
half furlongs over the old Bay District
track in l:33Vi, since which time it has !
stood as the mark for that distance. In j
the fifth event at the track over the bay
Dunois. the crack piece of racing bric-a- i
brae from Tom Ryan's stable, made Dr. j
Bheppard take some of his own medicine, (
and in so doing- reduced the record to j
1:32};. The betting on the race was i
noisy from the beginningâ the fiercest of j
.the afternoon. Dr. Sheppard opened fa- j
vorite at 6 to 5, and from force of the
general public's money his price was j
hoisted to 9 to 5. The skirmishers and
the chosen few Bet theirs down on Du
nois, forcing his price down from 11 to 5
to even money. O'Connell was also a
starter in the race, but, to use a gam
bling phrase, was only the "fall guy."
Having chopped out a fast clip to the
| stretch for the Doctor to follow, he
picked up his lunch-can and strolled !
home. "Skeets" Martin, on Dunois. then
challenged Sheppard, and. despite
Thorpe's vigorous work, led him out a
neck. It was a programme carried out
without hitch or flaw.
This was the only eventful feature of
the sport. Favorites again took three !
purses.
Bliss Rucker closed favorite for the j
opening event, at six furlongs, and after
leading to the stretch finished third. So- I
cialist, well ridden by Macklin, and sec
ond choice in the betting, won driving
from Two Cheers.
The brown Morella colt Eddie Jones j
made his first start this season in the â 
seven-furlong run that followed. Backed ;
down to favoritism, Thorpe had him in !
front almost from the start, and won
easily. Meadow Lark disposed of George ,
H. Ketchum for second place.
The three-furlong dash for maiden
2-year-olds proved a fizzle. Purser's filly
Flamora was backed from sixes down to ;
2 to 1. and she, together with Ice Drop
and Big Horn, was about the only one
that got away from the post. Through
some misunderstanding most of the oth
ers pulled up. Flamora won easily from
Ice Drop.
The books were scorched over the result
of the mile and a sixteenth selling run.
Gotobed, ridden by Holmes, was backed
to a standstill at short odds and, out
classing his field, led Alicia over the line
by half a length. Tom Calvert took the
show from the badly ridden Coda.
The famed Santa Anita stable furnished
the favorite for the concluding sprint. El
Estro, backed up from 6 to 5 to 8 to 5
and begging, was bumped and landed far
beyond the coin. The Pride, from Ryan's
stable, heavily played, won all the way.
Tiburon, an outsider, was second.
Track Notes.
The Thornton stake at four miles will
be decided to-day.
Fred Foster said if Dr. Sheppard was
beaten a record would be lowered.
If used in one, the recall flag should be
used in all 2-year-old events.
The finish in the closing event between j
Elsin and Yaruba for the show was very
close. The former was very heavily
backed, but many thought Yaruba was
there ahead of Blaketey's horse.

February 8, at noon. The house inte
rior was redolent of flowers and cool
with the greenery of palms and ferns, j

and banks of violets graced every nook |
and corner. The ceremony was per
formed by the Rev. Alfred Kummer,

Miss He'ene Kelley presided at the or
gan and during the services played
"O Promise Me." The bride wore an
elaborate gown of white silk, the high i

Prevention of Cruelty to Children is in
vestigating a peculiar case of a man's
brutality to a small boy. The lad. who
is 9 years of age, lives with his mother at
2>4 Ellis street. On Monday evening he.
In company with some other children, was
In front of Smith's furniture store on El
lis street near Mason, when he was set
upon by one of Smith's clerks and severe
ly beaten. Officer McMurry. who was a
block away, heard the child's cries, but
when he reached the place the affair was
over. The man claimed thr> lad was
jumping upon the trunks on the sidewalk.
Officer McMurry says he will get a war
rant for the man's arrest to-day.
Protest Against a Nuisance.
The warm -weather has intensified the
nuisance at the foot of Fillmore street,
where an inclosed basin is maintained by

at the Mayor's office yesterday were W.
F. Herrin and Rev. Dr. Adams 01 the
First Congregational Church. Two weeks
ago the managers of the Fair estate
promised to make an opening in the sea
wall to admit the tide freely. Mayor
Phelan has requested Dr. A. P. O'Brien
to investigate the place after this is done
and to report as to whetner it is an ad
equate remedy. The point of complaint
is looked upon as a veritable plague epot.
"Shake Hands and Tell Tour Papa
Good-By" is the latest coon hit. On

Barry yesterday on a charge of disturb
ing the peace, preferred by Mrs. Nuncio
Nostri. 1217V4 Kearny street, a neighbor.

marking that a man who had the courage
to marry his mother-in-law had enough
punishment. _

CONVENTION
OF MINING MEN
IS PROMISED
Institute of Mining En
gineers to Come.
IT WILL BRING THOUSANDS
STATE MINERS' ASSOCIATION
DISCUSSES MANY BILLS.
Wants $25,000 for the Paris Exposi
tion â Tangled Story of an Ap
propriation That Has
Never Seen Used.
At a meeting of the executive committee
of the State Miners' Association, held in
tho Union League Club's rooms last night,
the secretary read a telegram from R. M.
Raymond, secretary of the American In
stitute of Mining Engineers, to the effect
that the next session of that body would
in all probability be held in this city.
This will be one of the biggest conven
tions San Francisco has ever housed. Tho
Institute has about 3000 members, and as
a rule at least 1000 delegates attend each
convention. Besides this a number of
firat class mining men always foliow in
tho train of these conventionsâ men with
money to invest and who know a mining
country when they see it. Secretary
Benjamin of the Miners' Association has
been corresponding with the secretary of
the institute for some time, urging that
the convention be held here. Yesterday he
received the following telegram:
E. H. Benjamin. Secretary: Formal action
to-morrow night or Wednesday. Have con
sulted Council individually and can premise
acceptance, subject to satisfactory arrange
ment of details between yourself and me
R. U. RAYMOND.
As soon as the preliminaries are ar
ranged President Neff will appoint a com- i
mittee to arrange for the details, recep
tion and entertainment of the delegafes.
The convention will be held some time
next fall.
The real purpose of the meeting last !
night was to consider legislation regaru- j
I Ing mining matters. Senator Davis, '
| chairman of the Senate Committee on i
, Mines and Mining, was present, and spoke i
of the general outlook. He said it would I
be useless to ask for any kind of an ap- ;
propriation out of the funds of the pres- ;
! ent year, as the Governor would be more ;
I than likely to veto them should tney :
pass. Six yea-s ago a bill was passed !
appropriating $250,000 out of the general ,
| fund for the purpose of building restrain- i
ing dams. This money has never yet been !
used, and as the general fund is already |
i exhausted, it does not really exist. The :
miners do not wish to lose the money, how- j
ever, and an effort will be made to have
it set aside as a special appropriation out j
of next year's moneys. This will keep !
it safe from the hands of the legislators
until the miners are ready to use it. A I
committee was appointed to confer with
Governor Gage on the matter.
This same committee will also have
| another matter of importance to attend
to. The original bill appropriating monqy |
' for the Paris exposition has been so badly
cut that it now looks as though the min
-1 ors will get but $15,000. They want at
least 125,000, and the committee will en
deavor to have it raised to that amount.
The committee consists of J. M. Gleaves
(chairman), Dan T. Cole, C. G. Yale, Ju
lian Sonntag. James O'Brien, Mark B.
Kerr. K. H. Benjamin, J. P. Halloran and
j Edward Coleman.
Th" bill now before the Legislature
j changing the recorders of claims from
county seats back to the old mining dis
tricts was also discussed, but no recom
mendations were made on it.
Generous Memorial Donations.
Nathan Dusenbery, Lewis Dusenbery,
Rosalie Dusenbery and Mrs. Dora Dia
mond have made donations aggregating
$6000 to the following charitable societies
of San Francisco in honor of the memory
of their brother, Jacob Dusenbery, who
recently died in this city:

High Art Calendar.
The Northern Pacific Railway Com
pany has issued for '99 one of the most
attractive calendars of the year.
It appears in a series of six richly
colored lithographs of one of the fair
sex in military or naval dress.
These pictures are six in number and
under the caption "Cupid in Camp" and
"Cupid on Deck," a fair lass Is shown
with love always in the background in
attractive poses.
So radical a departure from the stere
otyped form of advertising will doubt
less fulfill its mission in inviting atten
tion to this popular overland route.

\; ' DRIED FRUIT IN NEW YORK.
â¢" ' The New York Commercial says: "Reports
â from the coast show that no more apricots
â¢: are procurable there in any position. If a
. â holder had a few cars they would net him j
'â â a. "s'rriall fortune. Apricots are wanted by do- I
â  ireptic buyers, but no business has resulted '
. because buyers will not meet the views of
holders. , _
: â¢â¢-Supplies of peaches are running low. But ,
â  few. If any are left in first hands on the ,
â¢ coast and holders are retaining them very i
firmly, thinking that they are good property
at present prices and under the present ten
dency of the market, Carry-over stocks sell
as readily as new crop peaches, and buyers
are quite as ready to pay a full price for
them. Fancy goods command almost any i
figure, though nominally quotations anÂ» from I
25 '<: - â 
Prunes arÂ» considered good property, though
there is comparatively little movement Just at
present. Conditions favor Improvement, how- |
ever, and the rapid cleaning, up of supplies on j
the. coast shows the tendency. Prices remain
steady on the spot. There is reported to be j
â  -Borne inquiry from interior points, but no im- i
portant trading has been noted. A consider- i
.;.: abl-e number of email orders are received but ;
â â  riff large sales have been made for some time.
â â â  The oonstant withdrawal of small lots has re
: suited In greatly reducing stocks, and buy- j
â  "erii and Fellers are apart in their views and i
â¢^â "active business Is practically Impossible.
" .: ' Kai^ln? Bhow no change. Conditions are such
: .-thai at present it Is impossible to tell the :
: 'exact situation of the market. The prospect is j
" that present supplies will be cleaned out before
'the new crop comes in, but it may be neces
â¢â¢ gary to regrade some of the long boxed stocks
,- to. effect a clearing. It Is not thought that
,'â¢ prices .will change materially until the next

CHICAGO MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. 21.â Unresponsive Liverpool '
cables gave wheat an easy start and May
commenced Vie lower at â  72% c. While the
opening price expressed the opinion of the
majority there was. however, an influential
minority that thought the concession in prices
a valuable opportunity to possess themselves
of ' some wheat, and May .quickly recovered
from the opening decline, and in less than an
hour had touched 734 c. The buying that woke
up the shorts and disturbed their confidence
In lower prices came largely from the North
west and waa brought about by a sensational
drop In , the temperature In the British pos
sessions, twenty below zero being reported
from Winnipeg. The holiday to-morrow ap
peared to be feared by the shorts, and al
though there was some disposition to sell at
over 73c for May, It was wanted back again
when any stand was made by the holders.
Near the end the market was subjected to
a little of the hammering process by the
scalpers, and May declined to 72%. The bulls,
however, came In and May recovered to 73iÂ»c
where it closed. â¢
The threatened reinstatement of winter
weather with Increased consumption as one
of its consequences held corn firm. May closed
unchanged.
The oat market traveled under ttiÂ» super
vision of the other grains. May closed Vie
higher.
A halt In the deliveries of hogs on their pre
vious enormous scale strengthened provisions.
An Improvement In the demand for cash meats
was a helping Influence. May pork gained 20c,
lard 5c and ribs 10c. j

QUIET MARKET FOR DRIED FRUITS.
NEW YORK. Feb. 21.â Journal of Com- i
merce pays: The market for dried fruits as a
whole still presents a very quiet appearance. :
Raisins are unsettled In sympathy with ad- j
vices from the coast regarding uncertainty of
the future of the combination. Currants art !
easier. There is more demand for peaches and !
apricots and the market Is firmer, but not
quotably higher.
In California the loose muscatel raisin mar
ket Is dull and the feeling is unsettled In view <
of the uncertainty as to what may be the out- !
come of the mass meeting of growers in March, !
when the fate of the California Raisin Grow- I
ers' Association will be settled one way or |
the other. The general impression seems to
be that the combination will not be renewed.
So far as the resolutions of the combine re
garding the disposition that Is to be made
of cheap stock are concerned, traders in the
East do not feel any more reassured by them
than they felt before the claim was being \
made that there is nothing to prevent wineries I
from reselling these goods below the market
prices, as they have done before.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Feb. 21.â storm of last week

terially different from last week In regard fj
prices. Staple territory wools are â¢ scarce at

NORTHERN WHEAT MARKET.
OREGON.
PORTLAND, Or., Feb. 21.â There is nothing
new in the local wheat situation and quotations
are unchanged. Very little business Is being
done at the prices named, and It Is doubt- |
ful about a cent or two above them bringing j
out much wheat. The damage to crops In
the Interior is believed to be much less than
was at first reported, but In a measure It Is
helping the hold-your-wheat element, as also
the continued dry weather in California. Some
transactions for "milling purposes were reported
at 694 c for heavy Walla Walla wheat, but
69c was the highest quotation obtainable from
exporters and few of them would go above
57@58c. Valley Is nominal at 69@60c, and blue

WILL NOT SUBMIT TO
THE GAS COMPANY
One Patron Who Shows His Resent
ment for Its Exactions by
Means of a Suit.
Apparently the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Light Company has run up
against another of those little circum
stances which tend to rob life of joy. It
has once more- been trying its bulldozing
tactics in relation to meters, has been
sued and now wishes to compromise.
It seems that E. Osterdorf. a grocery
man of 2701 Howard street, rented prem
ises from an owner who lived on the floor
above. The meter was never changed to
the name of Osterdorf, but the bills were
regularly paid. On a recent occasion the
collector called when Osterdorf was out.
and so that gentleman went to the office
to settle the bill. There he was informed
that he would have to put np a deposit
for the meter, and this he promptly de- I
clined to do. The representative of the
company then told him that unless he
paid the meter would be taken out. He
still refused, and the threat was made
good. .Osterdorf found that evening that
his store had to be lighted by means of
lamps.
Displeased at this treatment, which he
considered both unjust and unlawful. Os
terdorf consulted an attorney, who there
upon brought suit, setting the amount of
damages at JluOO. The company then
seemed to relent, for after a brief interval
the meter was replaced, and a little later
dsterdorf received a message from his
lawyer that the company was ready to
compromise the case for $250. Before giv
ing a decision he will consult his lawyer
more fully.
Just where the corporation calculates
on securing a profit from this style of
usage has frequently been discussed, but
never explained.

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, but Sals and Ef-
fectual Cure for It.
Catarrh of stomach has long been con-
sidered the next thing to incurable. The :
! usual symptoms are a full or bloating j
i sensation after eating, accompanied some-
times with sour or watery risings, a for-
mation of gases, causing pressure on the
[ heart and lungs and difficult breathing;
headaches, fickle appetite, nervousness
I and a general played out. languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste In the mouth,
; coated tongue and if the Interior of the
stomach could be 'seen it would show a
slimy, inflamed condition.
The cure of this common and obstinate 'â 
trouble is found in a treatment which ,
; causes the food to be readily, thoroughly j
' digested before it has time to ferment i
and irritate the delicate mucous surfaces j
of the stomach. To secure a prompt and j
healthy digestion is the one' necessary I
thing to do and when normal digestion is
secured the catarrhal condition will have
disappeared.
According to Dr. Harlanson the safest
and test treatment Is to use after each
meal a tablet, composed of Diastase, Asep-
tic Pepsin, a little Nux. Golden Seal and
fruit acids. These tablets can now be found
at all drugstores under the name of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, and not being a
patent medicine can be used with perfect :
safety and assurance that healthy appe- '
tite and thorough digestion will follow j
their regular use after meals.
Mr. N. J. Booher of 2710 Dearborn St..
Chicago, 111., writes: "Catarrh is a local
condition resulting from a neglected cold ;
in the head, whereby the lining membrane
of the nose becomes inflamed and the
poisonous discharge therefrom pass-
ing backward into the throat reaches
the stomach, thus â¢ producing ca-
tarrh of the stomach. Medical au-
thorities prescribed for me for three
years for catarrh of the stomach without '
cure, but to-day I am the happiest of men !
after using only one box of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets. I cannot find appropriate ;
words to express my good feeling. I have j
found flesh, appetite and sound rest from
their use."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the safest
I preparation as well as the simplest and j
most convenient remedy for any form of j
Indigestion, catarrh of the stomach, bil-
iousness, sour stomach, heartburn and
bloating after meals.
Send for little book, mailed free, on \
stomach troubles, by addressing Stuart
Co., Marshall, Mich. The tablets can be
found at all drugstores.

REFUSES TO BE
A WITNESS AT
BRANDES' TRIAL
Emma Oliver Fails to
Come to Court.
A BENCH WARRANT TO ISSUE
JSBANDES WROTE TO HER FROM
THE COUNTY JALL.
2)r. S. H. Buteau Undergoes a
Most Rigid Cross-Examina
tion Lasting Six Long,
Weary Hours.
Oakland â  Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 21.
After numerous determined efforts to
eerve a subpenae on Miss Emma Oliver j
as a witness m the Brandes murder trial j
Detective Herbort finally succeeded last j
night, but the young woman failed to put j
In an appearance at Judge Hall's court j
to-day. If she *till persists in ignoring j
the summons of the court when she is
called to the stand, a bencn warrant will
Issue and she is very liable to be pun
ished for contempt of court.
Miss Oliver, whose true name Is Mary
Olivejia, is a domestic in the family of
Attorney James Crittenden on San Pablo
ftvenue. She is the young woman with
whom William A. Brandes, the accused
murderer of his daughter, kept company
clandestinely. When Brandes was arrest
ed he wrote a letter to her from the
County Jail informing her that he
' (Brandes) expected to go East shortly to
secure money for his brother, who he
â wrote, wus in grave trouble. This act of
deception, together with the letter, will
â¢ be shown up before the jury through IVnss
Oliver and thus the prosecution hopes
further to show the base character of
.the accused. .
The effects of the trial are weighing
lieavilv upon Brandos. He sat in court to
. day motionless, with his eyes staring |
steadily to the tloor and his face resting ;
upon his right hand. When his alleged |
second wife, Etta Brandes, who is also |
charged with murder, appeared in court j
.this morning u> have her case go over for |
another week. Brandes paid little or no j
attention to her. In fact, as she Ifaned
over to whisker to him he seemed bored.
Dr S. H. Buteau, who was on the
Â«tand as an expert for the people all of
â  last Friday, was again rigidly oross-ex
emined for six long, weary hours to-day,
and the defense will call him again next
Thursday. He was the only witness ex
amined to-day, and the closest scrutiny,
the most eager efforts of Attorneys Saw
yer and Bennett and their most minute
comparison of his testimony with that
given at the preliminary hearing failed to
disclose a single flaw upon which the Oe

THINKS MME. MONTAGUE
IS "INSANE OR WORSE"
â
JUDGE HARVEY BROWN ON OAK
â  â¢ LAND'S SENSATION.
He Says the Letters Published Do
Not Bear Out His Understand
" v - ing of the Yaies Di
vorce Suit.
-' . Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 21.
The story of the divorcing of Mme. Mon- |
' rfague Tates and her husband against their '
wishes and the strongly worded letters
â â from their Montreal home published in j
to-day's Call was the sensation of the j
hour in this city. The lady's assertion
that she is the victim of an outrage and
that the secret of the conslpracy is known j
to only three people, two of whom reside ;
In Oakland, caused much interest among \
the members of the bench and bar.
â¢ Mmc, Montague is the cleverest woman
that has been in this city for many years.
Just how clever she is is now dawning j
Vpon 'those left behind. The madame's j
correspondence to her friends in Oakland j
and San Francisco is of the most contra- j
dictory nature, and is more mystifying
than some of the mystic doctrine taught
toy the lady.
This evening Judge Harvey Brown gave
the following explanation of the romantic
' affair:
â¢ "I am ordinarily averse to appearing
â¢ v in the newspapers," . said Judge Brown. i
â¢ "but under the circumstances I feel it a ;
duty to state my exact connection with
the divorce case between Mme. Montague" ,
and her husband.
"Some three and a half years ago she j
applied to me to commence such, a suit. ]
I declined on the ground that both were j
acquaintances and friends, and I was un- !
willing to have anything to do with the '
case. Subsequently some one introduced ]
her to Mr. George de Golia, and 1 was In- \
formed that he had commenced the suit,
as the papers had been served upon the
â¢defendant.
"Some months after that, in a conver
sation with the madame, I asked her
â¢what she was doing with her divorce suit.
She said 'Nothing. Said I, 'Why do you i
â¢commence such a suit as that and not I
have it tried?' She replied that she was I
afraid to; afraid that he would kill her:
that en the day the papers were served
-on him he rushed into her room, â  caught
her by the throat, choked her and had
murder in his eye. \
â¢"Things passed along without any fur
ther comment until some thirteen or four
teen months since, when the captain, her
husband, came to Oakland and stayed, I
' should judge, about three weeks. She
complained that he was threatening in his
manner and made her life a burden, and
one evening she came to myself and
â¢ another gentleman wringing her hands
and crying, and asked us to advance
money to pay the expenses of her hus
band to England, or else she feared that
' he would murder her; that he had threat
ened her life and his own; that he had
talked about shooting in her presence and
In the presence of Mrs. trice, her com
panion, and that only the day before he
had come into her room," locked the door,
and from his conduct she thought that
her time had come. .... .
"Mrs Price was brought into the con
sultation, and she too was very much
frightened, and feared that unless he was
lent away the madame would lose her
ft fa â¢ 'â â â â 'â ' ' " '_
"After full consultation it was agreed
that we would furnish the money, to pay
his expenses to England and keep him
there about a month, and that for â¢ her
protection in case of his return the di-
Re Â»uit should be prosecuted and a
decree obtained in her favor, In order
that she might apply to the authorities in
case he should return and disturb her.
"We did furnish the money to take the
trip to England. Some little time after
his departure we commenced talking
about bringing thi! divorc^^suit to trial,
but one or two important witnesses were
out of the State and we determined to
await their return.
"About last October it was concluded,
in consequence of Mme. Montague's
health to give her a vacation, and that
it was best for her to take a trrp to the
Eastern States. About the middle of that
month she told me that her husband was
on his way out here via the Canadian
Pacific Railroad. Shortly after that she
reported that he was in British Columbia
staying with some relatives; that ehe de
sired to leave here before he could reach
Oakland, as she did not wish to see him.
"Shortly after that she told me that,
according to her calculations, he would
be here between the 20th and 25th of No
vember and that he would come with his
brother, who was In command of a col
lier. She was anxious to start East be
fore that time, and she did leave here on
the evening of the 20th of November last.
"A few days before starting I suggested
that she was g;olng to be absent a number
of months and as the witnesses had not
yet returned that her deposition had bet
ter be taken before leaving and that
when the witnesses arrived they could
be examined and a decree obtained dur
ing her absence. She did not make the
slightest objection. On the contrary, she
hunted up papers and letters were looked
for which were introduced in evidence,
and she went before the commissioner
and gave her testimony voluntarily and
gladly to all human appearances.
"Very unexpectedly Mr. de Golia called
me to the witness stand and a few ques
tions were propounded to me. Everything
that was done In the way of having her
testimony taken was in accordance with
the agreement made at the time wo
agreed to furnished the money to her
husband with which to go to England.
"I was never more (surprised in my life
than when I read in The Call that power
ful influences had been brought to bear
upon her to give her testimony. And still

more suprised at the tenor of the letter,
supposed to have been written by her and
published in this morning's Call.
"As I stated last evening to a reporter,
who called on me and showed me what
purported to be a copy of a letter from
Mme. Montague to some person not
named, I cannot believe that Mme. Mon
tague is the author of that letter. If so,
she must be insane or worse."

REGRET THAT
THEY CANNOT
SPEND COIN
Candidates Object to
the Limit.
TOO LITTLE FOR PICTURES
REPUBLICANS TO BE ACTIVE
FOB, TWO WEEKS.
John L. Davie to Make His First
Speech on Thursday Evening.
Doing Much on Small
Outlay.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Feb. 21.
The greatest obstacle against which
candidates have to contend is the purity
of election law. There is a disposition
among the army of candidates for city
offices to spend money, but they can hard
ly begin to be generous before they have
reached their legal limit. All kinds of
subterfuges are proposed by which the
law may be beaten, but the developments
in the case of Howard Wright have
proved that it is not always safe to at
tempt to evade the law, and there is con
sternation on the streets.
The candidates who declare they suffer
most from the limit placed on their ex
penditures are the candidates for the
Council. They are limited to a total ex
penditure of $48. This will barely pay for
putting cards in the newspapers and for
a contribution to the campaign fund. It
certainly will not pay for the thousands
of illustrations that are defiling every
tree, sign post, fence and vacant building
in town. Notwithstanding the limit, some
candidates have proved their ability to
fet their printing done for quarter rates.
or on no other basis could $48 be made
to pay for the vast amount of pictorial
campaigning that is being done.
There is a disposition to willfully exceed
the limit and take the chances of break
ing the law. It is declared that if the sec
tion limiting expenditures were carried to
the Supreme Court it would be declared
unconstitutional. There are laws already
covering every ppsslble form of bribery
and corrupt use of money in campaigns,
and it is argued that if a man wishes to
Bpend legitimately a thousand dollars on
advertising his campaign he cannot be
restrained from doing so. This matter
has never been tested, but it is not impos
sible that some ambitious candidate may
run the risk.
The Republican City Central Committee
will meet Thursday evening, at which
time all campaign meetings will be ar
ranged. The Seventh Ward Republican
Club will meet Friday evening to arrange
for a lively campaign in that district.
On Thuisday night the Democrats will
open their campaign in the center of the
city, with John L. Davie as the chief
speaker. .
INSANITY HIS ONLY HOPE.
Trial Commenced of J. W. Lynn, Who
Fired Five Bullets Into
His Wife.
OAKLAND, Feb. 21.â A plea of insanity
is the only hope whereby John W. Lynn
hopes to escape conviction of the charge
of shooting his wife five times last Feb
ruary. The trial was begun this morn
ing- in Judge Ogden's court and up to the
time of adjournment the following named
jurors were accepted and sworn: Wil
liam Bliss. Owen Lafferty, G. W. Drake,
Joseph Lyson, G. VV. Pratt, John Har
rington and S. F. Brown Jr.
Considerable difficulty was experienced
in securing the above seven jurors, for
in many instances jurora expressed preju
dice toward the plea of insanity, some
going so far as saying that any man who
deliberately fires five shots into his wife
| without some very good motive must be
: crazy.
Lynn sat calmly beside his counsel
J. P. McElrath and Hugh Aldrieh. Not
I an expression of hope or despair appeared
on his face and the proceedings affected
him not at all.
It will b* remembered that during
Lynn's preliminary examination he went
violently insane and was committed to
! Ukiah, from where he was discharged
as cured about three months ago. At the
trial Drs. King. Elster and Twitchell of
! the Ukiah Asylum, Dr. Sponogle of Ag
news. Dr. Gardner of Napa and Dr. M.
Gardner, chief surgeon of the Southern
Pacific Company will be called as ex
| perts.

DENIES THAT
SHE THREW
FIERY ACID
Mrs. Montgomery Is
Now Talkative.
IT WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT
TEELS DEEP SYMPATHY TOR
MISS KUCHS.
Would Not Have Spoken, but Is
Anxious to Be Set Right for
the Sake of Her
Children.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 21.
Mrs. Jennie Montgomery' has at last
given her version of the alleged acld
throwingr on her husband's face while he
slept, and it differs very materially from
the story told by Montgomery. She says
she is compelled to explain for the Bake
of the children.
"I used neither pistol, horsewhip nor
acid as a means of revenge," said Mrs.
Montgomery- "For the sake of our two
children I would not harm a hair of his
head. This poor life of mine is all I
wished to destroy, thinking at the time
it was superfluous. If acid got on his
eyelid or face it was purely accidental. It
was painful, I am 6ure, as I found it so
in my own case.
"As for sleep, there was no sleeping
done in our house from 1 o'clock until
after 6, either by children or other occu
pants of the house.
"A drunkard or tippler I am not, nor
ever was. I was born and raised in Oak
land and have many friends who have
known me from my birth and would not
let me rest under this stigma. I cannot
think my husband even said this. I think
he was surely misrepresented in the mat
ter, or if he spoke of drink at all he was
not thinking of me.
"As for the parents of Mlsa Kucha, I
feel the deepest sympathy for them, es
pecially for the mother. I myself have
suffered much and know how to feel for
them.
"And as for the girl herself, at this i
time, I feel nothing but sorrow. Her mem- |
ory, though, I fear is poor. But, per- |
haps, this, too, is a newspaper misrepre- j
sentation. I think she must have said: 'I |
have not seen Mr. Montgomery for several !
days' (not weeks), for at the time of our
last meeting she at least displayed the
merit of truthfulness.
"As for being in hiding, I have been ab
sent but a few hours from my home from
the time of my husband's departure."
Montgomery is progressing very favor
ably and may yet regain his eyesight.
Mrs. Montgomery's explanation does not
state how the acid got on her husband's
eyes, which was found on them by the
physicians at the hospital.

MISS BURTON
CONSOLED BY
HER FRIENDS
Her Sacrifice Brings
Sympathy.
THE ASSAILANT NOT FOUND
JOSEPH ALEXAKIS ALSO SAW
THE TRAGEDY.
The Story That Piarry Owens Told to
the Police â Looking for a
Rounder of the
Tenderloin.
There â were very few developments yes
terday in the investigation of the murder
of Charles M. Hawley. Interest centered
more upon the unfortunate woman, Alma
E. Burton, who, from her sense of duty
to a principle, sacrificed herself in an ef
fort to save a drunkard from a lower
depth of degradation and death. Friends
gathered at Miss Burton's home yester
tiay to console her and to assure her that
they condoned the terrible step sho had
taken. Every effort was made to soften
the sting of her shame and she was left far
more encouraged than she had been since
. the tragedy which revealed so much that
was bitter to her. In a few days she will
resume her work at the Peniel Mission
.on Montgomery avenue and Kearny
Street.
The detectives are now convinced that
Hawley owed his death, not to the jeal
ous rage of a rival or to the wrath of an
Injured relative, but to the chance blow
of a tenderloin rounder, who resented
Hawley's drunken familiarity. Two new
â¢witnesses who are able to add elements to
the story of Hawley's death were dis
covered yesterday. Both complete the se
irios of facts which prove that the assail
ant who put out Hawley's life had no pre
meditated malice in his blow.
On Sunday night two hours before he
received his death blow Hawley was seen
In company with a mail at Kearny and
(Sacramento streets. It was thought that
this man might be able to throw some
light on the murder, or might have been
a party to it. An investigation shows
that he was neither implicated nor knew
anything of the crime. The man is Har
ry Owens, who is connected with the
Peniel Mission, which Miss Burton con
ducted and which Hawley attended.
Owens met Hawley on Kearny street,
near Jackson, shortly before 7 o'clock.
The two men. known to each other j
through their associations at the mission,
continued their walk together down Kear
ny street toward Market.
At the corner of Sacramento they
parted, Owens to go back to the Mission
and Hawley to proceed toward Market,
with the remark that he intended to go
to hi? room and retire. He delayed on
the way, taking enough liquor to intoxi
cate him. Before he reached Grant ave
nue, aear Geary, where he was assaulted,
it was almost 9 o'clock.
Another man also saw the encounter
between Hawley and the stranger. The
Etory of this new witness, in its essential
details, is corroborated by that of Paul
Mamogni and the three boys. The new
witness is Joseph Alexakis. an itinerant
peddler of fruits, who frequently places
his stand on (Jrajit avenue, near Geary.
On Sunday night Alexakis was at this i
place and 'noticed Hawley staggering up
Grant avenue from Geary. Within a few
feet the peddler saw Hawley jostle a
stranger and again stagger until he fell
headlong to the pavement. This account
of the murder agrees substantially with
the story of the other witnesses.
It shows beyond doubt that there was
ho premeditated malice in the blow of the
Stranger, and even if he were caught it
fs doubtful if he would be held for an
offejise more serious than manslaughter.
An autopsy performed on the body of the
dead man showed that his physical condi
tion, before death had been such that he
could not have lived very long before the
natural end would have come. The im
oie-diau- cause of death was a fracture of
the frontal bone of the skull, received in
the fall to the sidewalk. The detectives
will continue their search for the un
known assailant, but there is little hope
of finding him, aa he Is probably some
hardened denizen of the Tenderloin, who
knows the virtue of silence.
KNOCKED DOWN BY
HER BROTHER-IN-LAW
CHARLES H. RODGERS CONVICT
ED OF BATTERY.
At the Request of the Capitalist's At
torney Judge Mogan Postponed
Sentence Till To-Morrow.
Chas. â H. Rodgers, a capitalist living at
Tenth and Folsom streetÃ, was convicted
by Judge Mogan yesterday afternoon on
l charge of battery preferred against him
by his sister-in-law, Mrs. Fay J. Barnes.
Mrs. Barnes was living with her sister
at the Rodgers residence, and on February
8. while Rodgers had some money in his
.hand, she playfully struck his hand and
the money rolled on the floor. Rodgers
P;ot mad and knocked her down. She was
n consequence of the assault confined to
her bed for over a week.
John J. Mahoney, a druggist at Folsom
and Tenth streets, testified to Mrs.
Barnes calling at his stor?. and that he
found that her jaw was swollen and there
was a lump on her temple.. Dr. J. Henry
Barbat also testified to attending Mrs.
â¢ Barnes, but he only found Â£. mark on her
tlerhple. He admitted thai, Rodgers had
spokf n to him about the rise, and Rodg
ers had promised to pay S\s bill for at
tending Mrs. Barnes. *
The defendant and his tfife both testi
fied that Mrs. Barn<>s received her inju
ries by falling against a cÂ»air. and Rodg
ers denied striking: her. tHe insinuated
that Mrs. Barnes was not a good sister
lo-law to have. Prosecuting Attorney
JoaeTiimsen testified that oe had lived in
the same house with Rodgers for two
years and knew that his personal reputa
tion- was good. He knew nothing about
.his genprai reputation. "
â  Attorney L*)ng. for the dereridant. asked
that sentence be suspended' until to-mor
row as he intended to appeal to the Supe
rior' Court. The Judge consented.

A BURGLAR SEEKS
DEATH IN PRISON
Charles Silders Tries*
to Hang Himself l
In a Cell.
A DELIBERATE attempt was made<|>
yesterday morning by Charles Sil-*
ders. alias Loeer. to strangle him-A
self in his cell in the City Prison, (
and he declares that he will make sure?
that the next attempt is successful. T
Silders was held to answer before the*.
Superior Court by Judge Mogan Monday^
â¦
on two charges of burglary, for break-
Ing windows In the stores, 310% California
street and 522^ Pine street and stealing
several articles. When held he remarked
that he was a "socialist and believed that
he was justified in stealing if he was hun
gry and had no money to buy fond. At
the time he was arrested by Detectives
Ryan and ODea he told them that if the
case went against him he would kill him
self, as he had only once to die anyhow,
and he preferred that to spending several
years In the penitentiary.
Silders occupied cell 27 in the prison
along with a number of other prisoners.
About 11 o'clock yesterday morning he lay
down on a bench in a dark corner of the
STANFORD PARLOR'S BALL
A SURPASSING SUCCESS
A GEM OF DECOKATIVE ART ONE
OF THE FEATURES.
< Two Hundred Couples Take Part in
the Grand Marchâ Those Who
Accepted the Invitations
Sent Out.
Never in the history of Native Sons'
Hall were ther^ mnrp beautiful decora
tions aijd a more brilliant assemblage
than last night, on the occasion of the
thirteenth anniversary hall given by
Stanford Parlor No. 76 of the Native Sons
]of the Golden West. It was a full-dress
function in the full sense of that term,
the many ladies who took part in the
dance being attired in elegant costumes,
while all the gentlemen were in full even
ing dress.
The decorations, the work of A. F.
Sehleicher, a member of the parlor, were
superb. The idea evolved was "Under the
Sea," the materials being Nile green, tin
sel, fishes, crabs and nondescript sea mon
sters, grasses, ferns and silver tinsel, all
arranged in a combination most artistic,
the effect of which was heightened by
colored electric lights and various hues
of calcium reflections. The central piece
was a gem of art. as was also the stage
setting, representing a sea grotto.
In the grand march, which was led by
D. A. Curtln, the president of the parlor,

cell after taking off his coat and vest. Un
observed he unbuckled the belt round his
waist and making a noose of the buckle
end slipped It over his head. After tight
ening it round his throat he tied the other
end round the bench as tightly as possible
and covered his head with his coat.
Andrew Costello, a prisoner In the cell,
made the remark a few minutes later that
Silders was making queer noises and just
then Si!(i< rs rolled off the bench. A rush
was made to him and it was seen thut he
was purple in the face and unconscious.
Sergeant Wolf and Policeman Dougherty
were notified and they soon had the belt
removed and Silders was hurried to the
Receiving Hospital in the patrol wagon.
He was placed on the operating table, and
Dr. Rinne applied an electric battery to
his hands, and the shocks soon brought
him round. When he recovered conscious
ness he dramatically placed his hand on
his heart and said: "I'll do a better job
next time." He was taken back to the
prison and placed in a cell, where he will
constantly be under the supervision of the
"trusties."
Silders was formerly a sailor on the
revenue cutter Rush. About two months
ago he had a light with another sailor in
Oakland and knives were drawn. Silders
was cut on the left arm and his opponent
was cut in several places. Silders was ar
rested, but the case w.as dismissed.
and Mrs. Curtin, there were about two
hundred couples, who, after the many
windings around the hall, took part in the
first number on the programme, a waltz.
This was followed by fifteen other modern
dances, and it was midnight before the
most enjoyable party given by Stanford
Parlor terminated. The several commit

STOLE A HORSE AND BUGGY
A Bold Thief Makes Off With John
Quadt's Rig.
John Quadt, the well known merchant
at 1614 Market street, mourns the loss of
a valuable horse and buggy, and has
sought consolation from the police, who
are aiding him to recover his stolen prop
erty. '.!;>'â  -"' -
The rig was standing in front of his es
tablishment at 7 o'clock last evening, and
a nervy thief, seeing its inviting attitude,
sprang on to the seat and drove off. The
horse and buggy were not missed until a
half hour later. Mr. Quadt rushed over
to police headquarters and reported his
loss. He describes the horse as being a
sorrel animal with a black spot on its
back, and the buggy as having a closed
black top. Mr. Quadt is positive that it
was stolen, as the horse has frequently
been left untied and has never strolled
away. /

Mission Cars to Glen Park.
Ground was broken on Bosworth street
yesterday under the supervision of Chief
Constructor H. H. Lynch of the Market
Street Railroad Company for the new
branch line which will, when complete,
extend from the Mission road at College
Hill to Glen Park. Although the distance
is short, it will be expensive, as the rail
road company will be compelled to run a
tunnel under the tracks of the coast
branch of the Southern Pacific. The new
line is expected to be running by the Ist
of April.
