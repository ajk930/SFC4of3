DEATH AND RUIN IN
THE CYCLONE'S PATH
KIRKS\ [LLE, Mo.. April
27.â The sky emptied its
fury in a cyclone upon
Kirksville at (kjo o'clock to
night, when the east side of the
town was wiped from the map.
A broad, dean path, nearly a
quarter of a mile wide, lies
through the town as smooth as I

homes, where an hour ago fami

It is the record ,4 the St. Louis

TON, April i~. â The secret of
the backing and filling in the
matter of the sailing of the
cruiser Badger, having the Sa

ers on board, as told by The Call
exclusively this morning, is out.
Armed with your dispatch, tell
ing of the publication in The Call
this morning o f the receipt at
San Francisco of telegraphic or
ders to stop the Badger for im
portant dispatches, and the sub
sequent dispatch of a message to
let the cruiser proceed, 1 visited
the Navy Department to-day and
learned that Rear Admiral Kautz
was within an ace of being re
lieved of the office of comman
der in chief of the Pacific station
and recalled immediately from
Apia as the result of the publica
tion of the letter he sent to his
cousin in Cincinnati. President
and Secretary Long were very
angry with the admiral for writ
ing a communication showing
his dislike of the < iermans in Sa
moa. That the administration
at first intended to take prompt
action was shown by the fact that
orders to the Badger were coun
termanded: then she was di
rected to proceed. These orders
were again countermanded and
again she was given sailing or
ders.
Finally the Navy Department
telegraphed to have the Badger
recalled, but this telegram was
revoked by another sent after
ward. Particular exception was
taken to the admiral writing
these words:

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON. Mass., April 27.â Edward
Atkinson, the famous Boston million
aire, anti-imperialist and economist, in
an interview with your correspondent
to-day defiantly announced that he
was, personally, the alleged traitor who
had been flooding the American army
in the Philippines with letters and â¢
pamphlets tending to promote discon
tent and insubordination and to pre
vent the men from re-enlisting. He â 
also said he would keep on sending j
them.
"Have you been* charged with dis
loyalty for conducting this work?" he
was asked.
"Only by the editorials in the news
papers."
"Have you any reason to suppose
that your documents will be stopped?" j
"I hardly think the authorities would
venture on such a base attempt to j
prevent soldiers who are voters from
being informed as to the state of pub
lic opinion .at home."
"Have you taken any other means to
reach the troops.'"
"Oh, no; I do not think it is neces
sary. It would be very easy to send
documents to correspondents in Europe
and have them mailed under foreign
postage, but I do not think any such
measure is necessary."
"To what extent have your pamphlets
been circulated, and have any other ;
documents been sent out?"
"Not to my knowledge. I think thai
the speeches and letters of Senator
Hoar, Judge Edmunds, former Gover
nor Bout well and others are to be Bent
in large numbers, to the end that the
privates In the ai my may know the :
direction in which sound public opinion
is moving rapidly in this country."
"Might not this produce insubordina
tion?"
"Yes; the kind of insubordination \
which, I hope, with Tolstoi, will ere
long pervade all armies, to the end that !
criminal aggression may be made im
possible by the refusal of soldiers who
think for themselves to carry out or
ders which are as abhorrent to them j
as they are inconsistent with any \
moral, economic or political principle.
' 1 sent my own pamphlets on "The I
Hell of War' and upon 'Criminal Ag- j
gression' to the members of the Peace I
Commission, including Admiral Dewey,
and to several of the generals of the
army whom I believe to be persons of
humane dispositionâ perhaps as much
shocked by the orders from home as
we have been here. I also wrote to the
Secretary of War for a copy of the
army register checked so as to indicate
what regiments and officers may be
now in the Philippine Islands in order
that I might send ;> very considerable j
number of pamphlets to their ad- I
dresses. 1 should be very glad to re
ceive mailing lists for this purpose, as j
I have not secured the army registers.
Being in communication with Secretary
Gage on other subjects I informed him
of my purpose, hoping that the facts
might be presented in Cabinet meet

MANILA, April 27. â Colonel
Frederick Funston of the
Twentieth Kansas Volunteers
is the hero of Calumpit. He crossed
the Rio Grande this morning wi'h a
small for,ce after his brilliant but un
successful attempt last night, flanked
the insurgents and drove them from
the strong position they held.
The crossing was effected under
a tremendous fire from the rebel
trenches, which were manned by the
strongest force the insurgents could
assemble to guard the railroad
bridge, their line extending for a
mile on either side.
This was the most daring enter
NO TRACE OF STARR

LOS ANGELES, April 27.â The dis
appearance of H. S. Starr, em

The only theory now remaining is

supposition is based on the fact that
no blood has been found in the trail he

Starr, who was a member of Com

the volunteers, but was deterred owing:
to family cares. While he bore a high

Philippines. It was Colonel Fun

river. On the opposite side lay, sup

armed with artillery, but the control
of the river was of immense strategic
value and it was necessary to cross.

one or more artillery pieces, with which
they threw schrapnel into the Ameri
can lines.
In regard to their artillery, however, it
is possible that they may have had only
one piece and that they moved this con
stantly from place to place before fir
ing, with the object of conveying the
impression that they had several.
The American and insurgent lines
were separated only by the width of
the river â 100 yards. There was a con
stant scattering fire. When night came
yesterday Colonel Funston made a dar
ing attempt to surprise the insurgents.
His plan was to lead fifteen men across
the bridge under cover of darkness and
surprise and attack the insurgents.
The bridge is long and much exposed.
Colonel Funston sent. Corporal Fergu
son of Company E of the Kansas Vol
unteers to reconnoiter the bridge. The
corporal stripped and crawled along the
girders to within twenty feet of the op
posite shore, and an insurgent sentry
approached within ten feet of him
without discovering his presence.
Ferguson reported that the plan was
. impracticable, because, the rails having
been removed, walking would be dan
gerous and the wounded would fall into
the river. In other respects than the
loss of the rails the bridge is intact.
Colonel Funston then decided to lead
120 men across the river a mile to the
westward and enfilade the insurgents.
His purpose was to surprise and rout
them. Eight companies of the Kansas
Volunteers furnished the details. The
march was down the river bank, but it
was moonlight, and the barking of dogs

Undaunted by two previous fail
ures, Colonel Funston persevered in
his enterprise and succeeded in tak
ing the Rio Grande defenses opposite
Calumpit. It was one of the most
daring- and dangerous achievements
of the present war.
The insurgents, numbering several
thousand, occupied almost impregnable
earthworks on the north bank of the
river, with the bridge so si :ii >] >< <1 of its

was consequently less effective than
usual.

Funston determined to endeavor to

"With 120 of the Kansas men he

THE FRIENDLY FILIPINOS
AFRAID OF AGUINALDO
MANILA, April 27.â General Lawton'a
advance has been a remarkable dem
onstration of the resistless energy
which characterizes all his undertak
ing. The last troops forming his col
umn only reached Xnzegaray to-day.
The men were badly played out, as dur
ing the past two days they have drag
ged bullock carts over roadless jungles
and through swamps, cutting their own
way far miles. They will rest three j
days, and then, with Colonel Sumner's !
command, consisting of the Oregon and
Minnesota regiments, the troops will re-
Eume the march westward, co-operating
with General Mao Arthur's forces In the
important enterprise.
The ambulances to-day, with a strong
escort, are bringing General Lawton's
wounded and a few of those who have |
Btrated by the heat across the I
country to the railroad.
A report has gained wide currency
among the volunteers that the Govern
ment intends to ask that there be no
fighting ufter Calumpit is captured,
and that it is the intention to replace
them at the front with regulars who
are being brought here on buard the
transports.
Th* committee of Filipinos organized
to mediate between the Americans and
Aguinaldo fear to approach the rebels
after the refusal of the latter to re
ceive the Spanish commissioners, who
were bearing a white 6&g. The com
mittee, after consulting with the com
mission, propose to tell Aguinaldo that
while no terms except unconditional
surrender could be offered after the
lengths to which the war has been car
ried, they could assure the rebels that
they would be treated according to the
American traditions of leniency to the
conquered, and that there would be no
punishments nor confiscation of prop
erty if they laid down their arms.
The committee told United States
Consul Williams) that they would go if
h-- would accompany them, believing
the rebels trusted Mr. Williams. The
latter refused, having no authority in
the matter. He said: "I do not believe
thÂ»- Filipinos would harm me, but they
might detain me for months."

BOTTLE EXPLODES
IN A BOY'S FACE
Wbile Heating Wet Sand Young
BlemlicK Is th>e Victim of a
Peculiar Accident.
SAX RAFAEL, April 27.â The young son of B. Brenfliek, a gardener,
formerly employed to keep in order the grounds of the O'Conner
house, where Dr. C. F. Buckley now lives, was the victim of a most
peculiar accident last evening, which may result in the loss of one or
both eyes. It seems that young Brenflick's sister lay sick. with the grip,
and in order to keep her from taking a chill the boy filled a siphon
bottle with sand and placed it in the oven Of the stove to heat. In a
few minutes he went to the stove a-nd took the bottle out. Just as
he laid hoid of it the bottle exploded with such force that the metallic
stopper was driven into the ceiling. So much sand was shot into the
boy's face that when the grains were extracted and the flow of blood
stopped by Dr. Wickman the skin resembled a sieve. Both eyes were
injured but with care the sight will not be lost. An investigation
showed the accident to be the result of ignorance of natural law. The
sand placed in the bottle wf:s damp and the steam generated by the
heat of the ',yen caused the explosion. One remarkable feature was
that while the bottle was blown into a thousand pieces, the walls of the
room being peppered by the bits of glass, not one particle of glass
ledged in th^ boy's face.

THE SECOND DIVISION
WASHINGTON, April Zl.â Under date
bruary 2s Major S. O. L. Potter,
chief surgeon of the Second Brigade, See
- on, in Manila, reports to the
War Department concerning the health
conditions of his command. The briga.de
at that time consisted of the First Colo

thirteen killed nnd forty-nine wounded. It
was this brigade that moved out and cap
tured the water works, which for some
time were in possession of the Filipinos.
The health nf the brigade was considered
excellent, better than it had been at any
time in four months. The percentage of
Bick waa only 5.5, including the wounded.
The food was good and included fresh

very largely populated by students of
the Normal School and the American
School of Osteopathy. Marcus Ward's
Young Indies' Seminary was a couple
of hundred yards east of the storm's
path. A hotel building close to it was
demolished. A score of guests stood up
on the porticos and in the dining-rooms
of the Still House, half a mile west of
the storm's path, and saw it sweep
majestically through the town, terrified
at the manifestation of the ruin and
death it was wreaking. Roofs blew
ahead of the blast like leaves.
Seemingly far in front of the revolv
ing point of the dun cloud stuff, and
full 100 yards in the sky, now and then
a great branching tree would toss un
in the arms of the blast high over the
city and spin on ahead like a wheat
straw out of a threshing machine.
People are found on every side who
tell of seeing human forms sweeping
skyward as birds, and from the list
of missing. among East Side families
the Btory seems credible.
One horse was blown out of the
shafts of a road wagon which lodged
against the front of a house in the edge
of the wind's track. No one knows
what became of the animal. Members
of households disappeared with the
partial demolition of homes, while oth
ers remained unhurt among the debris.
Along the edge of the storm path,
holes are seen through frame houses
as If punctured by cannon balls.
A second edition of the cyclone fol
lowed the first in about twenty min
utes. It came as an ink black cloud,
widely distributed, and covered the
whole town. On its front the terrified
people beheld a gleaming yellow crest
with a sweeping, changing, ominous
aspect that betokened another chariot
of death. Many took refuge in cellars
while others awaited their fate in calm,
deliberate observation. The tall end
of the cyclone did not break upon
Kirksville, however, seeming to go by
overhead, gathering fury as it. went.
It is believed generally that this sec

UNVEILED STATUE
OF GENERAL GRANT
j Three Generations of the
Family Present.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA7~ApriI 27.-In the
presence of President McKinley and his
wife, members of his Cabinet, three gen
; erations of General U. S. Grant's family
and a great crowd of people Miss Rose
mary Sartoris, granddaughter of General
Grant, to-day unveiled an heroic ecjues
: trian statue of her illustrious grandfather
! in Fairmount Park. Although the day was
| not a holiday in honor of the event, there
i was a great outpouring of patriotic citi
| zens. Flags were everywhere displayed
throughout the city and the ships in the
harbor were gayly dressed in colors. This
; city each year commemorates the birth
: day of General Grant, but never did it
: celebrate it as it did to-day. The weather
was beautiful. The morning broke dull
* and gray and gave every indication of
; rain, but early in the morning the sun
i came out and his warm rays were never
! again crossed by clouds during the day.
President McKinley and Mrs. McKinley
enjoyed themselves Immensely during
their outing to-day. Everywhere they
were warmly greeted by the people, to
which both of them graciously responded.
! The President showed no signs of his re
i cent slight indisposition. Next to the
President and his wife, Mrs. Grant and
Miss Sartoris shared the attention of the
| people, and they, too. were cheered every
where they were recognized. The unvefl
; ing was a great success in every way; not
an accident marred the occasion, nor was
there a hitch at any time during the day.
The statue is located in a beautiful siiot
| along the east drive of the Schuylkill
River, in Fairmount Park. It is the gift
: of the Fairmount Park Art Association to
the people of Philadelphia.
The gallant little cruiser Raleigh, now
lying in the Delaware off this city, was
not lost sight of during the unveiling
; ceremonies. All day long great crowds
visited the river near where the cruiser
: is lying, and hundreds of people paid a
! visit on board and were shown about the
! vessel. The only active part the cruiser
] took in the ceremonies of the day was
the firing of a salute as the monument
was unveiled.
A most pleasing incident was the greet
ing between the President and the in
trepid Coghlan. captain of the Raleigh.
This was the first opportunity the Presi
dent has had of talking to the commander
6f the Raleigh since his arrival in this
cnuntrv. Every one watched to see how
the fighting captain would be received by
: the President of the United States, and a
great cheer went up as the President
stretched forth his hand and grasped that
of the commander. The President smiled
ami seemed In every way pleased to greet
the captain. The President Immediately
engaged in conversation with Captain
Coghlan, which lasted for fully two
minutes.
There was a review of the 6000 troops.
The parade was started at 2:30 o'clock.
' and trie line of inarch was north on Broad
r from Spruce, around the City Hall
; to Spring Garden street, thence west to
i the river drive in Fairmount Park and

them from discussing interna

So far as Captain Coghlan is
concerned, it is said that it was
not Secretary Long's purpose to
relieve him before he left Wash
ington to-day for Philadelphia,
and he will not do so unless his
conference with the President in
that city should show the advis

Captain Coghlan will hardly be

MONAGHAN BEHEADED
BEFORE HIS DEATH
There Is Still Fierce Fighting Among
the Natives of the Somoan
Islands.
AUCKLAND, N. Z., April 27.âPar
ticulars of the fighting in Samoa, con
tained in the advices received here from
Apia under date of April 18, show that
the battle between the friendly natives
and the rebels took place at Vailelo,
and that the latter lost one hundred
men in killed and wounded.
Further details of the deaths of En
sign J. R. Monaghan of the United
States cruiser Philadelphia and Lieu
tenant P. V. Lansdale of the same ves
sel have been received. Monaghan
was beheaded before he was dead. A
deserter from the Mataafa forces says
Monaghan and Lansdale were retreat
ing when they were discovered by a
chief and his wife, who were looking
for dead men. They gave the alarm
and Monaghan was shot while continu
ing the retreat. Later, it appears, the
rebels returned and killed Lansdale.
Monaghan fought until he was wound
ed and he was then beheaded. The
Joctor's examination of the remains
:>nnrms the statements made.
Suatelle. the principal rebel chief, ran
i away and told his people a hundred
i British had been killed.
Mataafan deserters assert that the
Germans sent cartridges in bags of
I rice and sugar along the coast in De
-1 cember.
Admiral Kautz, it is assorted in the
advices received, fired a blank shot on
! April S across the bows of a German
: schooner which was leaving Apia with
i out reporting.
The rebels, who were in possession of
the late Robert L. Stevenson's house
and some forts, were attacked in thr:
t rear by some Tamasese friendlies, who
killed thrre of them and wounded oth
ers. One friendly native was killed in
the fight.
Frightful weather has been prevail
! ing at Apia, the sailors being com
i pelled to sleep four nights in the wet
| trenches.
The friendly natives under the com
! mand of Lieutenant R. A. Gaunt of the
j British third-class cruiser Porpoise
! were attacked on April 12 from the
French mission station at Falita. One
of his men was wounded. The rebels
were eventually routed with the loss of
four men killed. The Tamasese lines
were extended April 13 to the Vailelema
SATISFIED WITH
OTIS' CONDUCT
IN PHILIPPINES
Secretary Alger Declares That
General Miles Will Not Be
Sent to Take Command.
WASHINGTON, April 27.â"We have
no secrets about the Philippine cam
paign," said Secretary Alger to-day.
"All the news we receive from Manila
regarding the campaign is given to the
public. The President directed that
this should be done. There is no un
easiness over the situation in the Phil- !
ippines more than we have had since
i Aguinaldo went on the warpath. The
President and Secretary of War have
perfect confidence in Major General
Otis, and those who act with him in
the Philippines. The public should re
member we do not have to rely upon
Otis alone, though he is a soldier who
deserves the confidence of the Govern- j
ment. But General Otis has with him
the Philippines Commission, of which
he and Dewey are members. He is act
ing in harmony with the commission,
and in the campaign he has the coun
j sel of Dewey and other members, who
] are studying the peace side of the
proposition. There is no reason to fear
; Otis and Dewey and the commission
will lose sight of the main purpose,
which is peaceable control of the
â  islands.
"In the strictly military campaign,
| General Otis has in the field executing
his orders Lawton, Mac Arthur,
Wheaton and Hale, who are among the
best we have in the army. They are all
working in perfect harmony, so far as
we know, and they are on the ground.
| and ought to be trusted as men who
understand what they are doing, and
what is necessary to be done.
â¢'The President is not interfering with
! the campaign in the Philippines as con
ducted by General Otis. Jt would be
inexcusable interference to set him
aside and send another general to the
Philippines to take command. It has
not been thought of by the President, i
: He has not thought oÂ£ sending Miles
i or any one else to the Philippines to |
. battlefield. Here Mataafa attacked the
! friendlies and Gaunt's brigade joined
â¢in the engagement and fought well.
Four bodies of slain rebeis were re
covered. The others were dragged
away. One friendly was killed and be
headed. The rebels had a German nag
flying from their forts.
About 2000 women and children have
sought refuge at the Maluit station of
the London Missionary Society.
The rebels are seizing the traders'
rifles, cartridges and stores, and the
traders are fleeing to Apia. Business
is at a standstill and a strong land force
is urgently needed.
Yon Buelow, formerly a lieutenant in
the German army and the man who or
ganized the forces of Mataafa here,
I armed with a sword, gun and car
tridges, proceeded to Savaii with thir
teen Boats nnd 400 rebels, and the Ger
man warship Falke sailed on a secret
I mission with Herr Hose and the Ger
man Consul on board. Captain Leslie
C. Stuart, commander of the British
third-class cruiser Tauranga, in the
absence of Admiral Kautz, who was
coaling the Philadelphia at Pango-
Pango, wrote to the German Consul,
urging him to secure Yon Buelo-w, and
the next day the Falke returned with
Yon Buelow on board.
The offer of New Zealand to send
troops to Samoa caused enthusiasm at
Apia. The inhabitants are almost
; unanimous in the belief that the Ber
lin treaty is a failure and there is a
! strong feeling in favor of annexation.
Prominent American citizens and Brit
ish subjects say unless Mataafa is sub
: dued another war is inevitable within a
i year.
The British third-class cruiser Por
poise is still engaged in punitive cruises.
On April 15 a battle was fought at
Mangia, fifteen miles east of Apia.
About 2000 rebels attacked a Gaunt
landing party, consisting of about 100
i men. The latter were subjected to a
' hot fire and retreated to the shelving
beach, where they defended themselves
bravely for a time and afterward swam
back to their boats under a heavy fire.
Chief Aulinangi, with twelve friendly
; natives, refused to retire, and charged
into a burning village, driving a num
; ber of rebels before him with splendid,
reckless bravery. Gaunt's party then
returned to the assistance of the friend
lies and the whole party retired, with
four men wounded and after several of
the party had miraculously escaped.
The cutter belonging to the party fired
all its Nordenfeldt ammunition during
; the fight and the Porpoise frequently
'â  shelled the bush. The rebels had eight
i men killed and many wounded. Only
j one of the bluejackets in the cutter was
wounded.
A trader fled toward the warship and
succeeded in escaping, although six
rebels took deliberate aim at him as he
was rowing off.
On April 17 a second battle was
fought at Vailelema. The fighting was
i desperate, the rebels holding strong
fortifications, which were ineffectively
Shelled by the ships. The friendJies ad
vanced to the attack, with Falioalete
and Dana on the left, Gaunt in the
center, with 120 men from Fuamasanga
on the right. Gaunt's party delivered
such a heavy fire that the rebels re
treated to a second and stronger fort
about 150 yards back. The Fuamasanga
friendlies bc-lted, but Gaunt crawled out
to the firing line and drove them back
at the point of his revolver. They then
advanced to attack the second fort, but
found the position too strong and lost
several men killed and wounded.
Ten shells from the ships burst close
behind the rebels and they sang a war
song after the explosion of each shell.
Gaunt again returned to the attack
and heavy firing on both sides fol
lowed, during which the attackers suf
fered further losses. Gaunt succeeded
in crawling to within fifty yards of the
fort, but found it too strong to cap
ture, as the friendly supports were un
reliable. The party then retired in good
order with four men killed and eighteen
â¢ wounded, of which number three were
mortally hurt. The rebel loss was not
I ascertained, but was probably small.
The Tauranga and Porpoise shelled
the position at sundown, but the re
sult of the firing is not known. Gaunt's
brigade and a portion of the friendly
supports stood the fire splendidly.
During the engagement Gaunt sue
! ceeded in capturing a German flag
â¢ which was flying over the first fort.
! The British Consul, E. B. S. Maxse,
; and Mr. Adel, the surgeon of the Phila
delphia, were under fire all day long.
A further attack was to have been
made the next day. On the return of
; the landing party Captain Stuart of the
Tauranga signaled "Well done, Gaunt's
I brigade," and the Americans and Brit
i ish cheered the returning party, whose
vivandiers were proudly carrying the
captured German colors.
KAUTZ MAKES HIS
OFFICIAL REPORT
He Wil Have Plenty of Coal to Sup
ply All of His Needs.
"WASHINGTON, April 27.â The fol
lowing cablegram has been received at
supersede Otis and Dewey and the
commission." , Â«. h c P ~_
This statement was made by the ! sec
retary of War in reply to mqumeb
about rumors of dissatisfaction with ,
Otis' conduct of the campaign and the
probability of sending Miles to Manila ,
to take command. The story that MUes
had been asked to go to the Phihpp nes
is said to have been started by a mem
ber of Miles' staff after the general s
call at the White House yesterday ar
ternoon. But that call was a personal
one made by Miles to ask that his son |
be appointed a cadet to the military ,
academy at West Point. The President |
did not send for him and did not aio
cuss any other matter with him.
General Miles has recommended the
organization of ten regiments of negro
troops for the Philippines, and he has
also recommended officers to command
them, from major general down
through the list. But he has recom
mended six additional generals for this j
force, while the law permits only one j
major general for every 12,000 troops, |
and one brigadier general for every j
4000 troops. By the greatest stretch of |
the law the President could not com
mission more than four general officers,
though General Miles recommends six.
The recommendation of Miles will not
be acted upon unless Otis asks for
more troops, but it indicates the source
of much talk about organizing the pro- j
visional army. There is urgent demand |
for more commissions in the army, both
from within and without the army.
Some of the officers now in the army j
see an opportunity for promotion In j
such an increase, and men who want
to get into the army hope for commis
sions, if pressure can be brought to
force the President to increase the
army to the full allowance of the law. i
This desire for commissions is the cause |
of most of the rumors that there will
be more troops called for, but that
question rests with the men conducting i
the campaign in the Philippines. If
Otis calls for troops the army will be !
increased, but not till then.
the Navy Department from Admiral
Kautz:
AUCKLAND, N. Z., April 27 (Apia April i
13).â Secretary of the Navy, Washington:
The receipt of your telegrams of March
21 and April 2 is acknowledged. Coal
cannot be obtained at Apia, but must be
ordered from Auckland. Everything is
quiet at Apia. I am not aggressive on
the Mataafa rebels, but I am protecting
the United Sr.ates consulate, United States
property and the government established
by the Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court. KAUTZ.
The telegrams referred to in the ad
miral's dispatch refers to the depart- j
ment's inquiry regarding the coal sup- i
ply of the Philadelphia. It is believed
the bunkers of the cruiser are suffi
ciently full to supply the vessel for j
some time, as she is practically at j
anchor. Steps have been taken, how- !
ever, to replenish the Philadelphia's
supply. The Badger carried 1000 tons
of fuel for her, which will last until
the Abarenda arrives at Pago-Pago,
Samoa, to establish a coaling station.
The Abarenda is now at Fort Monroe
and will sail from there the last of this
â week, carrying 2400 tons of the best
Virginia steam coal. She will also con
vey to Pago-Pago material for the
construction of a wharf and coaling
Station to be erected at that port. The |
work of erecting coal sheds will con- j
sume about a year. The wharf proper
is to be T-shaped and will extend out
from shore to the thirty-foot mark. It
win be supported on solid steel piles,
seven inches thick, which will be ;
screwed into the coral forming the
bottom of the harbor. The sheds for
the storage of coal will be of iron and j
the station will be equipped with small j
tramways and automatic steam ma- j
chlnery.

outing should be careful in selecting a
location where MALARIA 'is not prevalent.
It is not the boggy lands or swamp lands
! alone that are favorable to the development of
j malaria, for this germ lives and thrives in
1 very shady and damp places, in dark â  and
' damp cellars, in damp and poorly ventilated
houses, and in those districts where tearing up
' of streets and excavating Is being done.
The air we breathe, in the city as well as In
; the country. is very often impregnated with
this malarial miasma. While your constitution
! may be rugged, and for a time you may be
i able to overcome this poisonous Influence,
f eventually the symptoms will manifest them-
( selves. You will observe a feeling of lan-
guor and lassitude. You will suffer with
headaches (Fig. 1). yellow eyes (Pi g. 2).
coated tongue and offensive breath (Fig.
S), impaired digestion (Fig. 4). torpid or
inactive liver (Fig. 5). aches in the limbs and
oint" (F gs -">â  Other symptoms are loss of

! out feeling, dumb chills. Usually two or three
'â  of the above symptoms are present in the
earlier stages of malarial poisoning, and it Is
i now that the remedy is indicated. You can

ulate the torpid liver that usually results;

' does not purge and make you sick like the
drastic cathartics that are usually adminis-

naturally, stimulating all the organs con-

OF THE NATIVE SONS
SALINAS, April 27.â A very tired set
of Native Sons assembled in the
Opera-house this morning to begin
the work of the closing and most
important day of the present con
vention of the Grand Parlor, Native Sons
of the Golden West, for with very hard
work and very enthusiastic pleasure, as
In the case of the Argonauts' initiation
ceremonies last night, the delegates found
themselves pretty well worn out. No in
dications of flagging zeal or lack of In
terest in the day's proceedings were mani
fested, however.
The only persons who showed absolutely
no fatigue were the Indefatigable work
ers In the severnl campaigns that closed
to-day. These skillful "wire-pullers" were
Just as eager to present their respective
candidates' admirable qualities and es
pecial fitness for the office toward which
their aspirations pointed and just as en
ergetic in 'drumming up votes as they
were on the first day of" the convention.
The momentous questions for next year's
grand ofllcers. the questions that have
intruded themselves Into the most reck
less of the gayeties of the past week with
an insistence that would have been an
noying had it not been so engrossing,
have at last been decided, and everybody,
even disappointed aspirants, feel relieved
that it Is over.
The present session has been notable
for one of the hottest contests the Grand
Parlor has ever known, and bo much in
the way of "politics" has been carried on
that the atmosphere has been full of the
"zip" of very taut wires and occasionally
the snap of one which resistance at both
finis had caused to break in two in the
middle, bringing* each puller flat on his
Lack In consequence.
Again rain came to mar the happiness
of those who had charge of the arrange
inonts for the parade that was postponed
from Tuesday to to-day. Indeed, almost
up to the hour set for the spectacle it was
tt matter of doubt whether the weather
would permit the various bodies to march.
The condition of the weather under foot
os well aB overhead had to be carefully
considered, on account of the school chil
dren, whose drill was to make one of the
features of the procession, and the parade
committee felt that it could run no risk
of these 1100 little folks getting a wetting
rind some of them a cold in consequence.
Beauty ami persevemnoe drove the threaten
ing frowns from the face of the Storm King
this mornlnK, and though he was in a dls
fnting pwoil, ready to turn his flood gates
ajar, he fell a captive to the array or splen
dor md charming girls thnt Salinas desired
to present to the view of her guests in public
pageant. Poon the raindrops, that had been
falling at interval? so frequent that they
pepmed about to momentarily run into a heavy
rain, were chaped away by stray rays of sun

He was called by the court several

reason why he shouid remain, he left
the city.
The court is expected to submit Its

As lonp as there was the slightest prospect

that the parade would take place. Everybody

QUEEN FLORA'S
RULE IS BEGUN
Opening of Redwood's
Flower Carnival.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, April 27.â Queen
Flora balds sway here to-night, and will
continue to reign supreme until Saturday
night. At least once a year, and some
times twice, a flower carnival Is held at
this place by the directors of the Freo
Kindergarten Association for the benefit
of the association, this being the only
means of meeting the expenses of the
kindergarten school. For the last six or
seven years the school has been r un on
the revenue derived in this way until at
the present time the event has come to
be one of the most generally recognized
of the season. The patrons and friends
of the school have been and continue to
be most liberal in their support. The
present carnival, in the profusion of
flowers displayed, bids fair to be one of
the most successful ever held, this being
an exceptionally fine year In this valley
for (lowers. There will be no distinctive
flower shown this year, but the display,
will be general, carnations, roses and
sweet peas predominating.
The large Germania Hall, In which the
fete is being held, is one mass of vari
colored sweet-smelling flowers and plants.
Huge festoons of roses are hung from
ceiling and wall. The corners are
banked with one mass of bright colors.
The decorations are very neat, and much
tasie and skill have been shown in the ar
rangement of the tables. Immediately to
the left of the entrance has been placed
the depository, where for 10 cents one
may have his hat. coat, etc., taken care
of for the evening. Miss Kate Nealon
presiding. The northwest corner has
been inclosed by wire netTlng, which is
filled with 'sprays of roses, palms and
ferns, and within this inclosure Icecream
and cake are served by Mrs. F. W. Gleji
nan, Mrs. Havey and Mrs. Sahlberg.
These ladies deserve great credit for the
artistic manner in which they have fitted
up their booth.
The southwest corner of the hall is de
voted to tea drinkers. The floor of the
booth has been covered with matting, and
like the lce< ream booth, this -is inclosed,
the inclosure being covered with natural
growing bamboo, ivy and rose sprays. In
side two large umbrellas are suspended
from the ceiling, one of them being at
least twelve feet in diameter, the tops of
which are covered with ivy. Under these
umbrellas are placed bamboo tables.
Throughout the Inclosure are scattered
large potted ferns and palms, while the
tables are laden with roses . and sweet
peas. Here one may slack her or his
thirst and receive a souvenir cup and
saucer. The booth is In charge of Mrs.
Mansfield. Mrs. Hettin and Mrs. Gert
ridge, who are assisted by three young
ladies in .Japanese costumes. On the north
side of the ball, directly east of the hat
checkroom, is placed the lemonade booth,
presided over by Mrs. J. V. Swift and
Mrs. Townsi ml.
The displays are rich, tasty and pro
fuse and many of them deserve special
mention. Mrs. George C. Boss or Bel-
of Santa Cruz, were put in the box, but
neither of them made any attempt at doing
thf vtrorV he la capable â â¢(. Watson vi lie
diil not even pretend to do this. Fielder Berry
was first tried, and then Whalen went in to
let the opposing batsmen knock his delivery
around th>- tit-Id to the tune of eight runs.
The conduct of the players showed that they
; understood that tht-y were to do nothing but
pet through the game in any old way. The

GAGE'S INSULT TO
SENATOR PERKINS
The San Pedro Incident
Causes Comment.
DUE TO BURNS' CAMPAIGN
GOVERNOR RESENTED OPPOSI
TION TO THE MEXICAN.
And Took the First Public Occasion
to Show His Dislike of the
Distinguished Northern
Statesman.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 27.â The inci
dent during the speeehmaking at San
Pedro yesterday at the opening of the
harbor jubilee festivities, at which time
Governor Henry T. Gage not alone
slighted United States Senator George
C. Perkins, who was a guest of the
executive committee, but refused to
shake hands with the Senator from the
north and later administered a verbal
castigation, is the talk in political cir
cles and is on the tongue of citizens
irrespective of party.
The friends of Senator Perkins .who
> have been loyal to him here at this
time insist that as Perkins toured the
I State in the last campaign for the
ticket headed by Governor Gage, and
that they had always been friends-, the
Governor should not in his own home
town have made so glaring an error in
public as is couched in thtÂ» language
of his Bpeech. These friends of Per
kins believe, however, that as the pres
ent Senatc-r aligned himself, according
to reports, against I Jan Munis and fa- ]
vored the candidacy of r. S. Grant,
that in this is the true reason that has ,
prompted the utterances of the State's
executive, and that this is the begin
ning of the trouble between the Re
publican leaders.
Notwithstanding that the adherents
<>f Perkins state thai he disclaims any
Intention of having attempted to take
â¢ \' eptions to the course of Governor ',
Gage it is known here, and conies from j
undoubted authority, that Perkins was |
fully aware when hÂ»- arrived here yes
terday that the Governor had on sev
eral occasions said that he would at
the first opportunity resent publirly th"
criticisms he alleged Perkins had made
of his official acts. The meeting of the
iv. o gentlemen yesterday, which oc
curred on the speakers' stand, was wit
nessed by a ciowd of notables, who
wtitj keen with curiosity. They noticed
that Senator Perkins was greeted at th>
stand by all of those present excepting
Governor Gage, and it Is recorded by
those who saw the incident that Gage
deliberately turned his back to the '
Senatorial guest. Three times did Per
kins make himself known to Governor
Gage. Finally Perkins said: "Gov
ernor, you live at Uo\vne;> , near which
we passed on the train, do you not?"
This caused a perfunctory response. I
Senator Perkins, who went to San
Francisco on the overland to-night,
was seen by a representative of The
("all, and while guarded in his state
ments he said:
"I had the opportunity to resent the
reflection made by Governor Gage. I
did not take advantage of it because
1 prefer to treat the subject in a gen
tlemanly way. I am a servant only of
the people, and as such whatever treat
ment is accorded me of a personal na
ture a public rostrum on such an occa
sion would not be my choice for mak
ing a reply. If there be any credit due
me it is because 1 observed the dignity
due to those whose guest I was and
who alone can be the best judges of the
course pursued. I would never forget
that Mr. Gage is the chief executive
of the State."

Thousands Witness the Display and
All Rejoice in the New Com

hern California.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 27.â The floral
pageant was the feature in the ob
servance of Los Angeles day in the
harbor jubilee celebration. This proved
a brilliant" and artistic street spectacle
that for beauty and harmony in com
bination of colors of natural flowers It
would prove difficult to surpass. In
every respect did the parade exceed
any similar effort attempted in this
city, and the judges that were com
pelled to award premiums were be
wildered with the array of unique por
trayals and originality of design.
The parade, which occupied one hour
in passing a given point, was headed
by the well-disciplined Americus Club
of Pasadena. This organization was
followed by decorated vehicles, six-in
hands, tally-hos, carts and drags, bi
cycle clubs, caballeros, military and
civic bodies. A Chinese dragon fifty
feet in length, with scores of Celestials
in line, formed the closing attraction
of ihe parade. A Chinese mounted on
a white horse and dressed like a man
darin of the flowery kingdom was the
marshal of this division, who carried a
small American flag that he waved
over his head to command attention.
The entire display, witnessed by
thousands along the line of march, was
continuously cheered while the invited
guests from neighboring States and
Territories reviewed the parade from
a stand erected in front of the City
Hall.
The executive committee this morn
ing, with appropriate ceremony, un
veiled a memorial tablet that had been
placed in a niche of the Times building
to befittingly recognize the services of
that journal's persistent battle for the
success of a free harbor at San Pedro.
A loving cup was presented by the
same committee to Charles D. Willard,
who, as the first secretary of the Frea
Harbor League, rendered in the strug
gle for the harbor such services as has
met the approval of the public.
To-night the city is ablaze with thou
sands of electric lights. The people
have given the hours over to feasting
and merrymaking, and there remain
none who are not imbued with the im
portance of the event that marks the
closing day ot" a notable week of fes
tivities and one that creates a new
epoch in the commercial and industrial
history of Southern California and the
City of the Ancrels. Numerous search
lights from the tops of buiMings threw
their rays to all parts of the adjacent
country, bands of music on gayly deco
rated trolley cars are continuously
traversing all sections of the city, -while
the Americus Club is entertaining
thousands with its unique evolutions
on the paved streets of the city.
As a fitting finale the sky is brilliant
with a continuous display of fireworks.

PROFESSOR NIVIN'S
GREAT GOLD FIND
Regioo of Fabulous Richness Said
to Contain MoQtezuma's
Famous Treasure.
CHILPANCINGO, Mexico, April 27.â William Nivin, the noted arch
aeologist of New York City, who has been making explorations in a re
mote region of the State of (Juerrero, has discovered a gold region of
fabulous richness. The vein is three feet wide and assays from $200
to $5000 to the ton. The region in which this discovery was made is
red with prehistoric ruins. According to tradition Mnntezuma's

southwest of Mexico's capital, and as rained villages are numerous
there, it Is not improbable that the famous treasure has been found.
"BUCK SHEEP OF
CHRISTENDOM"
Strong Sermon by Rev.
W. M. Paden.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN A.NBELMO, April 27.â The annual
commencement exercises of the San Fran
cisco Theological Seminary were held at
Assembly Hall to-day Over five hundred
people were present from San Francisco,
Alamedn County and San Rafael, and in
order to make things as convenient as
possible for those who attended th( exer
cises the North Pacific Coast Railway
stopped all trains midway between San
Anselmo and Ross station, on the road
leading to the seminary.
The large Assembly Hall was beauti
fully decorated with flowers and over
greens by the junior class. Professor
John H. Kerr, D.D., chairman of tin fac
ulty, presided, and the exercises opened
with a hymn and prayer.
The first feature of the programme was
a series of addresses by William H. Bleak
ney, Charles P. Hesse] and Harry H.
Pratt. Bleakney spoke on "Conserva
tism." He said that â  conservatism pre
serves truth and truth both develops and
promotes as well. Christ he regarded as
a conservatist when he announced tils â¢ 1 "~
tention of fulfilling the prophecies, and
combated the Jewish law. Hessel took
a.-, his theme "The Heroic .Spirit." He
defined heroism as true manliness or
womanliness made- manifest. As an in
stance the pleading of Queen Esther be
fore the King for her people was men
tioned. "Truth as Light" was anted
on by Harry H. Pratt, who divided his
subject into three parts, viz., che Bible as
the word of truth, the true rellgio \ and
Christ, the essence of truth, and spoke on
the theme at length in its various phases.
The commencement address was deliv
ered by Rev. William M. Paden, D.D., of
Salt Lake City. Utah, who discoursed in
an eloquent and forcible manner on "The
Black Sheep of Christendom." He said
his plea was not so much for the heathen
or those in the slums as for "backsliders"
and prodigals, the lost sheep of the
church. He believed that two-thirds of
the criminal class is comprised of those,
who once had. good homes and were sur
rounded by good influences.
"The genesis or cause of non-church
going," he declared, "is because the fallen
are missed nowhere, expected n iwhere
and go nowhere. This evil can never be
remedied until the laws of the land are
better enforced against those vices which
are sapping the life of true manhood and
womanhood."
Rev. Robert F. Coyle, D.D.. president of
the board of directors, officiated it the
presentation of diplomas and gave the
members of the graduating class some > x
cellent advice as regards their future life
In the interest of tin gospel. The gradu
ating class was as follows:
William H. Bleakney. James M. Cor
nellson, Philip A. Fisher. Charles P. Hes
sel, Robert C. Jones, James Little, Harry
H. Pratt and Abraham D. Soper.

' race-goers at Oakland track yesterday
, that Dr. Rowell had first money in the
j McLaughlln stake already in his pocket.
Satsuma could not lose. The distanceâ
I one mile and a sixteenthâ suited him; the
i track was very slow and heavy, and with
' 104 pounds up thpre was no catching tho
j bald-face. Of the other four starters
I Hugh Penny and Joe I'llman alone were
1 conceded a chance. The brown colt Bd
-1 die .loiks. with Thorpe in the saddle, up
set the wise prognostications. Thorpe
had his mount in front almost from the
lirst Jump, and at the. wire led Satsuma
out five lengths. Jones, on the latter,
1 must have lost his bearings from the out
set, for he rode a very ragged looking
and uneven race. Rosinante, astride
which Jenkins had orders to pick the dry
going, traveled fully a furlong further
than the others, and then downed Joe
Ullinan and Hugh Penny for the show.
Short-pnjvd horses started off well by
capturing the lirst three races on the
card, after which outsiders in the bet
ting held a levee. The extremely bad go-
Ing was responsible for some queer-look
, Ing races, but only heavily muscled
equinef could last out.
The backers of Maud Ferguson, the
odds-on choice for the introductory sprint,
were nearly afflicted with heart disease
before getting in line. Saintly struck thy
stretch live lengths in front, and was only
caughi the lust few strides and beaten
out a head by the favorite. Pompino ran
a fair third, the others following strung
â . out for half a block.
, Galene, with Thorpe in the saddle and a
' 9 to a) favorite for the two-year-old
scramble, won in a walk. Getting away
to a running start the Burns & Water
house youngster played with hi.s com
pany. Miss Madeline, a racy looking filly
by Rio Bravo, succeeded in taking the
place from Kiekumbob.
Barney Schreiber furnished a piping-hot
favorite' for the third number in Miss Mn
rion. At oQdS-on the mare shook oft"
: Genua at the Stretch turn, winning eased
up. Tempo was heavily played for the
in which position the chestnut
horse finished, three lengths in advance
of Genua.
Delegating Humidity to occupy the
place of honor In the betting on the six
furlong sprint, tlfth on the card, proved
a most unwise selection. The mare pos
sessed mi. speed whatever, finishing la?t.
Backed from 4 to 2Vw, Jerry Hunt, ridden
by Jones, led throughout. Espionage I

PARK COMMISSIONERS MEET.
Will Build an Entrance and Driveway
on First Avenue.
At a meeting of the Park Commission
ers yesterday afternoon it was deter
mined to erect an entrance and open a
driveway on First avenue along to the
North Ridge road. President Adolph
Spreckels presided and Commissioners
Metson and Zeile were present.
The park band was engaged to give a
concern on Monday afternoon. May 1, in
commemoration of the anniversary of the
battle of Manila.
The board ordered the painting of the
Conservatory and Beach House.
A contract was let to the Union Pav
ing Company for 10.000 cubic yards of
loam at 6SV 4 cents a cubic yard, and a
smaller contract for hose was also
awarded.
PASSING OF
THE CENTRAL
PACIFIC COMPANY
Election of President
and Directors.
JAMES SPEYER AT THE HELM
CHANGE IN THE PERSONNEL OF
THE BOARD.
Only a Brief Enjoyment of Empty
Titles by the Men Who Will
Be Chosen To-
Day.
The last board of directors to engineer
the famous Central Pacific Company wIH
be elected this afternoon in the yellow
building;. They will enjoy hut a brief
incumbency, however -just long * enough
to know that they had titles empty of all
honor or significance thrust upon them.
The annual meeting; of the stockholders
this year will not be characterized by
warring- Individuals standing firm for
their own special interests. There will be
no representative of the English stock
holders at sword's point with C. P. Hunt
ington. All will be peace, harmony and a
passing of the loving cup.
James Speyer of New York, the finan
cier, who organized the consolidation
plan, has the fifty-two cards in his hands
and he may play them at will. He repre
sents over 90 per cent of the stock issued
and with this irresistible power under his
control he will merely dictate who shall
wear the toga and what they shall do
when enveloped in its folds.
It is the general belief that the per
sonnel of the board to be elected will be
entirely different from those of the past
Thcr^ will be no chaii^e in the chief ex
ecutive, however, as 1. L. Reo.ua is the
choice of Huntingdon and Speyer. Many
of the railroad men in the yellow build"
ing anticipate the election of a number
of local bankers to the directorate, men
who are deep in the confidence of Speyer
& Co. Whoever they are that have been
selected for the empty honor, their regime
will be a short one. When the contract
was signed in New York between the
Central Pacific and the Southern Pacific
Company for the consolidation and the
assumption of the former's bonded debt
by the Southern Pacific, the Central Pa
cific in reality passed out of existence.
The certainty of the future contingency
made the Central Pacific a component
part of an entity, the Southern Pacific
f'ompany. which from that time on was
to act for both.
The consolidation rind the new bond is
sue will not he consummated this after
noon. Mr. Speyer's plan of reorganiza
tion will not become completely effective
until the minor details are arranged As
soon as this is accomplished the Central
Pacific will pa^s out of existence. This
will be but the matter of a few months
and then the S<juthÂ»>rn Pacific and C P
Huntlngton may sign orders for the re-
Ifif-ring and repainting of cars. The
C. P.'s will all be S. P.'s and thus will
the enterprise of Stanford. Crocker Col
ton and Huntington pass into history

courteous-, manner in which he received the
officers of this association and gave them every
opportunity to lay our side of the question be
fore him, and recognizing the fact that large '

ried unanimously.
A SOLDIER DROWNED.
He Was Only 19 Years Old and Went
on a Spree Which Ended His
Life.
John Bribery, a private in the Thir
teenth United States Infantry, was
drowned last Wednesday night while in
toxicated and running away from a police
officer at the intersection of Fourth ave
nue and Kentucky street. Bribery arrived
in. this city with his regiment last
Wednesday and slipped past the guard to
see the sights of the town. He took in
the Barbary Coast and finally wandered
out to the place where he met his death.
He was intoxicated, and at midnight
staggered by Policeman Peterson and
Harry Coleman and P. G. I^ees, boat
men." Peterson called upon Bribery to
halt, but the soldier, fearing arrest, ran
away, and stumbling among the rocks at
the edge of the bay, fell into the water
and was drowned before assistance could
reach him.
The three men at once procured lan
terns and searched about the place where
the unfortunate soldier had fallen in,
and finally recovered the body with a
boathook. The body was taken to the
Morgue and was delivered to the custody
of the military authorities by Coroner
Hill. Bribery was only 19 years old. He
enlisted In Company L at Fort Niagara,
N. V., about five months -ago. He was a
native of New Haven, Conn., and his par
ents reside there.
Felicitations to General Smith.
The officers of Pioneer Council, Young
Men's Institute, of which Brigadier Gen
eral James F. Smith is a member, cabled
their felicitations to him last night upon
his advancement In rank. The message
read: "General James F. Smith, Manila-

FOUR LOVING
HEARTS UNITED
TWO charming couples joined the throng of April brides and pronms
yesterday.
A very pretty wedding was that of Julius John Kyers and Miss
Auguste Siebe, which was celebrated last evening at the home of the
bride's parents at Shell Mound. The happy couple were joined in the
holy bonds of wedlock by Rev. Dr. John H. Thtess, rector of Zion's

by the Gamblers.
ARCADE SALOON IN BUSINESS
MONEY HEAVILY WAGERED ON
THE RACES DAILY.
Broyer & Gly-nn, the Proprietors, Said
to Be Banking J. Roche, Who
Receives the Money and
Records Bets.
The impunity with which the racehorse
m< :\ and touts continue to violate the
recent ordinance of the Supervisors for
bidding the making of hand books and
- pools in the city on the result
c argues little for the efficiency
of Chief Lees and his officers, who are
suppose,', to represent law and order In
San Francisco.
Recently, after The Call's expose caused
ssag< of an ordinance whereby the
: :u of money at Engleside on th"
was made an offense, the touts and
men sought to evade the limitations;
of their demoralizing rights by making
hand books. That this was a fact and
that it was done with Haunting publicity
â¢â¢ the ordinance passed prohibiting
it The Call proved a few days ago. when
it dearly showed that a notorious tout
â  Fred Jackson was making a daily
habit of hunting up and down Ellis street
in the vicinity of Powell seeking for
victims, with whom he laid odds against
the horses. It was further shown that
the violators of the law made it a habit
to go from place to place plying their
lawl< ss business and that according to the
â  among thieves they limit their en
â¢ rgli s to certain districts. That is t
on< will not â  ncroach on the territory of
another.
The recent closing of the poolrooms has
not broken up the business of robbing the
poor, gullible wretches who were daily
wont to risk their mites In vain hopes of
beating the Impossible. Those that prey
upon the Insatiate greed* of the ignorant
still ply their high-handed robbery under
very eyes of the police. When these
men who have brought hunger and want
to many of the homes of the poor classes
were driven from Stevenson street they
simply moved away to other quarters
and took additional care to keep secret
their dens of iniquity, fine of these is
t>ut a little way off Market street, and
into it daily there go the pittances of
those to whom the small sums mean food
and clothing.
The place in question is the Arcade sa
loon, at the Bouthwest corner of Fourth
and Mission streets. The proprietors of
this den are Alexander B. Broyer and
.l<>hn P. Glynn, ana it is said that they
are behind the bank, so to speak.
A man who gives th.- name of J. Roche
is the stool pigeon of the house. He it
is who receives the money, records the
bet and pays outâ that is when the bettor
wins, which is seldom. This den is
crowded during the early morning hours
and while the races last. The money is
the bar by the man
calling himself Ko. he, but there is a pri
vate room in the rear, so that if any bus
is person or any one unknown to the
touts comes in the betting goes on un
molested. In this rear room is also a
telephone, by which the results of the
races are received. Roche is careful to
â  eipt Of any kind for the money
that is placed with him. The patrons of
the place are of 'hat class that cannot
afford to lose, and for whose protection
the ordinance against poolrooms was
passed. Th< se men and boys openly bet
their money, and the scenes that were
â  enacted In the dens on Stevenson
â  have simply been transferred Lo

yesterday there was the same crowd,
who, as usual, wen- fleeced. Imring the
afternoon Sergeant Conboy stood for a
while in froni of the Arcade saloon, but
his august presence had no effect on those
that wanted to risk their money. They
â  [y went In and bet their money and
then hung around to await the result of
the r;;ce. It Is said that Roche Is not the
true name of the man that takes the
money, but that he Jg in the employ of
Broyer & Glynn. However, he claims to
be running the pool on his own account.
This may be, but it Is not improbable
that the proprietors get the customary
"rake-down" for permittting the pool to
tx run in their saloon.
That pools are daily sold at the Arcade

MERCHANTS ARE
MAKING READY
FOR A RATE WAR
Local Jobbers Fear Railroads
Have Played Them False.
The Great Northern Said to Have Made a
New Tariff for the Benefit of
Eastern Competition.
SAX FRANCISCO'S jobbers have an
other battle on their hands. It is to
be the old war of transcontinental
traffic and a fight to prevent the big
wholesalers of the East encroaching upon
the territory of the merchants of the
West
Arrayed against the local dealers are
apparently the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific railroads, the Simmons
Hardware Company of St. Louis and the
EUbbard-Spencer-Bartlett Company of
Chicago, the two biggest hardware job
bers of .the Middle Bast, and sticking out
;UI over the situation can be seen the old
time fend waged for so long against this
city by the smaller jobbers of Seattle
and Tacoma. A combination of greed and
malice that the San Francisco merchan
dizes are just now Retting into their
lighting harness to run a joust or so with.
The whole situation hinges upon the
transcontinental rate on less than car
load lots of freight. l*p to a year ago
| the San Francisco retailer could bring a
keg of nails or a crate of shelf hardware
Into this city from the East for only
about 10 cents more on the hundred
pounds than the big jobber could bring in
carload lots of the same article. The big
â  tirms of the East took advantage of this
j condition, threw their traveling men into
this territory and by reason of their
larger volume of business were enabled
to offer inducements that won a great
portion of the retail trade from the home
dealers.
San Francisco was in a serious predica
ment. The rate as it exist. m! then en
abled the Easterners at all times to com
pete with the local merchant on a prac
tically equal footing and at no more ex
â  In business operation. As a result
of it the two tirms mentioned builded up
an enormous trade on the coast and cap
tured that of intermediate points.
Driven to desperation, the local mer
chants last March sent a delegation of
sound business men to Monterey to ap
pear before the Transcontinental Traffic
Bureau, then meeting at that point, to
appeal for a higher rat.' on less than car
load lots of freight. They prayed for a
freight that would cut the Eastern houses
off from the retail and small job
bing trade In this bcate and also
give San Francisco an equal snare
of the trade of intermediate points.
Those who represented the home deal
ers at the conference were Frank S.
Brown, W. H. Wheeler of the Hardware
and Metal Association, Charles 11. Tay
and C. Rulofson. The two big Eastern
hardware tirms had got wind of the
Western action against them and also
ha>l representatives on the spot, well pre
pared to fight any proposition to cut them
out of the Western sphere of profit.
There were three days of much palaver
and the San Franciscans came home con
vinced that their light was won. The
Traffic Bureau adjourned to .Milwaukee
and during the latter part of May met
again and. with all of die transcontinen
tal llrus represented and parties to any
agreement It might come to. bo raised the
rat. a^ to give the Western business in. :i
practically everything they had asked for.
The bureau divided transcontinental
fr. Ight up into live 'Masses and on less
than carload lots raised the rate on class
1 from }2 4ii to $4: on class 2 from $2 15 to
$2 00; on class ;>, from $2 to $2 50; on class
4 from $1 ~n to $1 '.m. and on class 5 from
$1 60 to Si 65, a schedule that effectually
shut out the Eastern firms.
Then local merchantdom settled down
humdrum prosperity of th<- time <if
and railroad men shook hands with
th.mseives that rat^s never before had
been in su.h good condition. The new
schedule was a good thing for the South
ern Pacific and anoth -r for the Santa F< :
and, in fact, for all the southern and Og
den-lines. They got .he long haul on all
freight west from the Eastern market to
notorious games had agreed to tem
porarily cease operations caused consider
able consternation among: the "grafters"
and "sure-thing" gamblers. Shortly after
the games closed down the disreputable
horde gathered about the Cafe Royal and
vigorously denounced the proprietors fur
acceding to the demands of the police.
"I thought they'd get cold feet," re
marked a well-dressed gambler, who has
waxed fat on the money he has won from
poker-crazed youths. "I was wlllin" to
make a book on it. We made barrels of
stuff for them, and now they throw us
down because the papers make a howl.
If 1 were int. rested in the gami 1 yer kin
bet yer dough that I would give 'em a run
for their money. Lees is makln' a roar
and pretendln 1 to be struck by the wave
of virtue, but it don't go with me. Sei "
I am goin' to open up a few games my
self and if these blokes try to down me
there will be sorm.-thin' doirr". Are you
WiS>'.'"
His sentiments seemed to meet the ap
proval of the gang and they loudly voiced
their approbation. Just as they were de
nouncing the police for interfering with
them a -broad-shouldered officer from the
Southern station appeared on the seenti
and compelled the disgruntled gang to
disperse. , _. .. .
Captain Spillane is determined that
gambling shall cease south of Market
street. As a precautionary measure, he
lias Instructed his men to visit the places
Where gambling has heretofore been ear
ii, d on every hour, and to arrest ariy and
all persons caught playing percentage
The visit of the Police Commissioners
to the gambling dens Wednesday night
no doubt impelled the proprietors to cease
operations until a decision in the pres
ent coses is reached. Satisfied that the
games come within the purview of the
law relating to percentage, the Commis
sioners agreed that they should be sup
pressed. Evidently learning of their de
cision, the proprietors of the joints,
rather than suffer the police to make an
other raid on them, concluded to shut
down until the ordinance is tested.
GETTING READY TO KILL.
Deputies Looking Over the Ground at
the Sea Lion Rookeries.
A preliminary Step toward thinning out
the seal herds will bo taken to-day. Al
Wilson and Mr. Nelson, connected with
the California Fish and Game Commis
sion, will po to Point Reyes to look over
i the ground and see if the herds have as
sembled at the rookery.
The majority of the herds do not stay
at the rookeries all of the year, but prin
j cipally during the season when the young
come "forth. This period is between the
first of May and th<- last of June. After
i th<' latter date the female sea lions take
I their pups away and the rookeries of the
- point are comparatively deserted, except
i by a few old females, until the next seu-
I son comes around again. In the interim
th.> Beats and tlu-lr young scatter along
I the const, only congregating at the en
trances of the bays and rivers when the
' spring and fall runs of salmon are on.
Then is when they <lo their deadly work
and reduce the number of fish going to
the spawning grounds by the. thousands
of pounds.
From what can be learned, the breed
â  in^ season of the sea lions lias not be-
Lruii yet. The deputies have gone to the
rookeries to get the lay of the ground, in
order that no time may be lost when
the real work of thinning out the herds
l>< f.'iiis. ']'):< reason that the lirst move
is to be made "ii Point Reyes is that the
rookeries there ar< r:"t on Government
ground, as Is the case.:vith the Farailon
Islands and the A.no r*ov<> Islands.

the San Francisco jobber and then they
got it back on the short haul to custom
ers at intermediate and local points, and
it is on the short haul and local business
the big lines figure for their biggest
mon.y. As it was under the old .schedule,
when the Eastern man controlled the in
termediate, trade, the roads had but the
one haul. The freignt was picked up at
St. Louis or Chicago and dropped along
the line wherever a customer was located.
but under the prohibitive rate everything
had to be brought first to the San Fran
cisco jobber and then .hipped out again.
The merchants and the railroads were for
oni c In great accord and San Francisco
bad a fighting chance to eventually get
.ill that was due her.
A few months later, however, it became
apparent that the Simmons people had
not given up the light nor played all their
cards. Their representatives appeared
again on the coast and to offset the in
creased freight rate they approached old
customers and guaranteed them a suiii
cient discount or rebate on their freight
bills to warrant them in again trading j
with the Eastern house, and at the same
time the merchants here noticed that the,
Simmons people stopped routing their
freight over their old '..ifs and were ship
ping Dearly everything by the Santa i-v
system. A suspicion thai the Santa Fe
Was evading the terms of the- agreement
was at or.cc aroused and a dose watch
was kept for some further Indication that
an attempt was being made to break up
the new schedule and open the gates
again for a tide of Eastern competition.
The next Indication came three weeks
ago, when a quiet tip came into town that
the Great Northern had secretly reverted
to tin- old rate and that the Northern la- i
CiflC was standing in on a deal to again
throw the Kastern tirms into the Western
territory.
Chairman Wheeler of the Hardware
and Metal Association at one.- called upon
the local agents of the Great Northern
and demanded to know if the road had
Inaugurated the old tariff. They
replied that if it had they had
not been so advised. Telegrams to
correspondents in Tacoma and Se
attle elicited nothing more definite,
but each day the agents of other roads
represent, d on the coast were being
warned by their head offices that the
Northern roads had broken down the har
rier between the West and East, al
though their new tariff sheets had not
is.-Ued.
Since that time there have been two
or three Becret meetings of the inter
>>t..i jobbers each week, and ways and
means to combat the latest danger to lo
cal trade have been much discussed. It
was suggested that the Seattle 'obbera
and others In the Northwest he lined up
and prevailed upon to request the North
ern roads to restore the schedule, hut
that proposition was spoiled by an
equally well authenticated tip that it was
upon pressure brought to bear by the
Seattle and Tacoma jobbers that the road
had gone back to its old schedule, In or
der to prevent a Kan Francisco invasion
of the northern field.
It was also hinted that certain local re
tailers were interested in the restoration j
Of the old rates, and that the action of
the Great Northern was but the begin
ning of a movement on the part of all
the roads] carrying transcontinental
freight. This rumor the Southern Pacific
people emphatically deny. They say that j
the northern roads have not so wide a
sphere of Influence south of Portland,
thr-ir action will force like action on the
part of the southern and Ogden lines, and
that the present rate is more to be de-
Bired by them from every standpoint
than the o!d one. The Santa Fe people '
say the same thing.
As it stands, however, the jobbers are
meeting every other day or so to dis
cover, if they may, just what they have
to tight. When tiny find the enemy
they will be ready for the mix-up, and
the few of them who were willing to talk
of tii. mutter yesterday were willing- to
guarantee they would put the quietus on
the Kastern linns before it was all over.

ENGINEERING CORPS
HOME FROM HONOLULU
CAME IN LAST NIGHT ON THE
AUSTRALIA.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia arrived last night anil anchored
:in the stream. She is six days twenty
three hours and forty minutes from Ho
nolulu, and carries 104 cabin and 303 steer
age passengers.
The passengers were chiefly enlisted
men of the battalion of engineers from
Honolulu, with fourteen officers. The of
ficers were: General E. C. Compton,
Lieutenants Rrittain? Coolldge, Cooney,
Schmeiden, Mills, Turner. Kern and Tlce,
; and Captains Draper, Rickon, Springett
' and Sweasey. The arrival of General
Compton has been anxiously awaited at
the Presidio, as the Neall court-martial
could not be completed without him.
Among the civilian passengers were:
: United States Senator C. D. Clark and
wife, Robert S. Moore of the Risdon Iron
Works and C. L. Wight of the Wilder
Steamship Company.
The soldiers aboard were very much dis
gusted when they found that they would
be obliged to He in sight of the city all
night without being allowed ashore, but
they made the best of matters. At about
9:3 C a party went out on a tug to wave
the boys a welcome, but as the iiuarantine
officers had not yet boarded the vessel
they had to content themselves by carry
ing'on a long-distance conversation.
The Australia had a very rough passage.
(>n 'he 25th she experienced strong east
southeast winds, with a squally and rough
pea. On the 25th at noon the wind hauled to
north-northwest, continuing strong, and
the sea was very rough. She came into
port with a light wind and smooth sea.
MISS TORRES DEFEATED.
Henri Windell's Will Construed
Against Her by Judg Coffey.
When Henri Windell ran his pen
through the clause in his will, bequeath
ing his household furniture located at his
late homo, 4 Burrell street, and (10,000 to
Marion Torres, daughter of the late Gen
eral Torres, and substituted the name of
Constance Hohle, he defeated one of his
own plans.
The hearing to determine the construc
tion of the will terminated yesterday be
j fore Judge Coffey. and the court held
that the effort of the testator to disin
herit Miss Torres was successful, it be
ing apparent that he did not wish her
to receive the legacies first incorporated
in the will. The attempt of the testator
to substitute Miss Hohle. however, the
court found was ineffectual, the legal ex
ecution being deficient. Consequently un
der Judge Coffey's ruling the bequests
revert to the estate. Tho court also held
that the attempt of the deceased to re
duce a bequest of $4("HX) to his sister. Maria
Dorothea Geetdts, to $:W0 could not hold,
as the testator simply ran his pen
through the figures $4'i<*> and substituted
the figures $:?000 in pencil, instead of re
voking the words which govern th> fig
uresâfour thousand dollarsâ and rewrit
ing tho request.
Tho loss of the bequest is a gri-at hard
ship to Miss Torres. She cared for the
dead man many months prior tp liis
death, and it was owing to her kindness
to him that the deceased made the origl
nal bequests, and many are of the opin
ion, as Miss Torres contends, that Windell
was not "f sound mind when he revoked
the legacies and attempted to give them
to Miss Hohle.
A Woman's Sudden Death.
An elderly woman, whose name is be-
Heved to be Mrs. Mary Donnelly, was
found lying on tho doorstep of the house
at 1329 Ellis street in an unconscious con
dition last night. The ambulance was
called, but before the woman could be
driven to the Receiving Hospital she ex
pired. When the woman was found on
the doorstep she bad a milkcan and a pie
in her arms. The doctors believe that sins
was suddenly attacked with heart failure.

HOME MISSIONS.
AT the session of the International Sunday
School Congress in Atlanta Dr. Vance of
Nashville, in delivering the address of wel-
I come, spoke with much feeling of the recent lynch
! ing in Georgia. His remarks were evidently cut in
j the telegraphic report, but enough remains to show a
; condition of very deep feeling on the part of this
I Southern preacher.
It is of interest that at the. meeting of the Maryland
I Presbytery, in Baltimore, on the 13th inst., Rev. Dr.
Joseph A. Vance, pastor of the leading Presbyterian
church in that city, delivered a pointed address on the
subject of the duty of the church to the Southern
negro. The occasion for it was the report of the com
mittee on "colored evangelization," which stated that
the negro problem was the most serious that faced
the Southern people and the most important of any
for the consideration of Americans. There are seven
millions of negroes in the field covered by the South
ern Presbyterian church, and the report said that to
the question whether that church had done its duty
by these people 'it had, with shame, to answer "No."
Continuing, the report said this is a critical period in
the history of church work among the negroes, and
unless heip was given to the African Presbyterian
church it would surely perish. If this happened the
church before God and man would stand in the posi
tion of having thrust the pitiable weakling out of the
fold to die of neglect, and the world would charge
them with having done so from race prejudice. Then
the church would stand in the ridiculous light of sup
porting a costly mission in darkest Africa, striving
at a supreme sacrifice to conquer the negro there,
i while turning him from their own doors here.
Speaking to this report. Dr. Vance said that the
church is confronted with a serious condition in re-
I spect to the salvation of the negro, and that it is a
ish thing to shut the eyes to the fact that the
j Southern people are lukewarm in regard to his wel
fare. He said young negroes are growing up natural
thieves and criminals simply because they are not
readied by any spiritual influence by Christian peo
: pie. The young negro cannot be taken care of in the
memories of the past, and there is less religious work
I among them now than when they were slaves. The
report of the committee was adopted.
We think that the elevation and control of the
negro has not been sufficiently considered on the side
of his natural religious instincts. The negro Metho
dist church has worked on that line with a measure
success. The Catholic missionaries among the
I blacks have done the same, and if more negroes were
educated for the priesthood the results would be
more significant. The Methodists have won their
way by ordaining a colored hierarchy and striving to
increase the number of educated negro preachers.
Among the negro Bishops of the Methodist church
are many highly ed I '.c men.
Their conference met three years ago in New Or
leans and was welcomed in a very thoughtful speech
1 y the .Mayor of that city. He spoke in a vein of
philosophy of the need of the educating in
fluence of the church among the blacks, and hailed
the conference as representative of a work of the
-t benefit to both races.
The conference responded in a speech by one of
the â  hops which was a model of oratory
and furnished an intcre ly of the effect of
lucation to the tro] igination of the
black race. The Bishop said that the two races were
i" }< ' incy of the Southern States, and there

THE APPOINTMENT OF SENATORS.
Governor of Pennsj s gone thr
ting M atl [J"-:-y to the â 
of ] â  r, after he had (ailed of an
election by the Legisl ture of that State. This fact,
with the opportunity for a similar effort in
California, has drawn public attention to the extent

Theoretically it may choose never to elect, and there

Senator. It is upon this ground that, since the foun

exercised. And no authority distinctly conferred
upon one department of the government can be as
sumed by a co-ordinate department without usurpa
tion.
But, in the third place, by analogy to other con
stitutional expedients devised to secure the uninter
rupted and harmonious operation of our political
system, when there is a vacancy in a Federal Sena
torship while the Legislature is in "recess" â that is,
when the legislative will cannot be immediately ex
pressed â the Governor is permitted temporarily to
appoint, and his limited authority is completely spent
when the Legislature reconvenes.
The better opinion seems to be that, within the
meaning of the constitution, no "vacancy" can happen
until after an election and the commencement of a
Senatorial term, and therefore that, even in. a State
where legislative sessions are biennial, if a term
should end during the off year the Governor could
not appoint. The power of temporary appointment
is manifestly conferred simply to meet such vacancies
as result from death or resignation during an existing
term. But, as to Pennsylvania and California, there
is no room for argument because, when the terms of
Senators Quay and White expired, the Legislatures
of the two States were in session, and under that con
dition the constitution not only does not direct but
clearly prohibits the exercise of the appointing power.
The precedents in the Federal Senate correspond
fully with these views, and there is no reason to be- I
lieve, even if there were not already a working ma
jority of Republican Senators, that in order to secure
a partisan advantage and in palpable violation of the
constitution, that able and patriotic council would re
verse decisions into which no political consideration
entered, and in some of which, it may be added, ex-
Senator Quay participated.
THE GEORY STREET FRANCHISE.
BEFORE acting upon the petition of the Market
Street Railway Company for permission to use
electricity upon its proposed "corkscrew" line
the Board oKSupervisors should thoroughly consider
two or three conspicuous facts. The franchise oi the
Geary Street Railway Company expires in 1902. The
Market street combine, which has succeeded to the
rights of this corporation, has made two attempts to
secure a regrant of this privilege several years prior to
its expiration. This action indicates that the company
is exceedingly anxious for a renewal of its privileges
upon the street and is not willing that they should be
arbitrated by the new charter, which goes into effect
in January next, nor by a Board of Supervisors
chosen when the issue is before the people.
In other words, the Market Street Railway Com
pany is seeking a franchise on Geary street in an ir
regular and furtive manner. It is possible that the
grant to the proposed "corkscrew" line, which is de
signed to cover Geary street from Taylor to Grant
avenue, would not complicate matters, but before the
'. Supervisors pass any such privilege they should thor
hly examine into the legal effect of their action.
No objection will be urged to the construction of
an electric line on Sixth. Taylor, Grant avenue, Bush,
j Sansome and other streets to the Barbary Coast, cx
i ccpt there appears in it an effort to gobble a valuable
privilege by indirection. A suspicious circumstance
tind in the fact that the Market street company
has declined to construct its electric line on any other
: street than Geary street. It was suggested that the
road proposed be built upon Taylor street to Post
and down to Grant avenue. This proposition was re
jected by the engineers of the corporation for ap
parently no reason whatever. It is. therefore, barely
ble that the construction department of the com
bine has received orders from the law department to |
run down Geary street as a preliminary to getting a
; foothold thoroughfare, which will exclude
j competition in the future sale of a franchise.
The safest of all plans would be the absolute re
fusai of the Supervisors to permit the "corkscrew"
line to run on Geary street. That would settle all
rence to the future. The people
of Geary street are entitled to an electric railroad in
â  of the present ramshackle cable line, but they
': will never get it so long as the Market street company
iys the privilege of forcing traffic from that thor
oughfare to its adjacent electric system. It is to the
â  f all parties that when the Geary street fran
chise expires it be sold to a corporation which will
construct a modern 1 lectric read upon the street.
FERRY DEPOT ECONOMIES
RARELY if ever before in the history of the city
have so many evidences been given of an car
n< ; intention on the part of officials to carry
reforms and e< The crusade of The
Call, carried <>n in so many different directions, has
almost everywhere had effect. The new Hoard of
Education has begun what promises to be a regime
genuine economy, racetrack gambling has been
I, the police have raided the offensive
phonograph parlors and g rooms downtown,
and now the Harbor Commissioners have set about
providing for economy and efficiency in the mai .
I of the ferry depot. Everybody, in short, seems
to be animated by the spirit of reform except the
Police Commissioners.
The work undertaken by the Harbor Commission
is by no means an agreeable task. It is much pleas
â¢l ! new men to the payroll of the State, even
when they are not needed, than to dismiss those who
.r< superfluous. The Board of Education had to face
a storm of protest when it set about the task of c.-mm
mizing in tiie administration of the schools, and the
Harbor Commission will have to confront something
of a similar nature. It is. therefore, the duty of all
citi/ens and all newspapers that have been preaching
and demanding economy to stand now by the officials
who are doing what they can to accomplish it.
The Call is the only paper in the city that lias
:y commended the Board of Education for the
lite way in which it has gone along weeding out
es and i iblishing the School Depart
ment on a strictly business basis. Our contemporaries
are ever vociferous in clamoring for economy in the
abstract, but when a chance comes to practice
â¢iiny they turn the other way. A good many citi
are of a like nature. It is for that reason i
cials find it so difficult to carry out reforms. The very
people who demanded them will oppose them when
put into practice.
By the exposure of the waste of public money in
the construction of the ferry depot, and in its mainte
nance : lie Call directed public attention to the |
gross corruption that existed there. A legislative
committee in an official report virtually continued
all the charges made by The Call. The Merchants"
Association took up the issue and aided in rousing
public sentiment on the subject Afterward some of
our contemporaries joined in the agitation. It now
appears the new commission proposes to practice
economy. The promise is .1 good one, and if it be
fully and honestly carried out the commission will
deserve well of the city and the State, and should b;
tfiven the open approval of all sincere friends of
economy in office and administrative reform.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
REV. JAMES WOODWORTH ON FLAX CULTURE.
Editor Call: I am very much gratified to see the use you make of l your
columns In encouraging and fostering the agricultural and manufacturing a~>
well as the other industries of the State. I am especially pleased just now witn
your Interest In the growth of flax, and I read with great satisfaction your re
cent editorial upon the subject. in which you express such sensible views or me
matter. I think there is no doubt that much of the land in California is wen
adapted to the growth of this valuable plant and that with Droper facilities ror
gathering and utilizing it after it has matured its cultivation might be made
highly profitable over wide areas of the State. Your implied doubt as to
"whether flax can be permitted to ripen its seed and at the same time afford
a fiber in condition for use" I think can ensily be set at rest. I have before me on
my table as I writs a bundle of the fiber grown in this State in as perfect con
dition as could be desired or imagined, taken from stalks that were allowed to
completely mature and from which the seed was threshed fully ripe and ready
for the oil mill, and I am assured by those well informed on the subject that
no trouble whatever in this regard need be apprehended.
The great difficulty in the matter arises from the lack of proper facilities for
gathering and saving the crop after it has matured. By the process now in
use much of the seed ie lost and the fiber is so broken that It is almost useless
except for fuel, for which In some portions of Washington and Idaho it is actual
ly used. Various devices have been contrived to overcome these difficulties, but
none of them that have so far been brought to a public test have met the re
quirements In a satisfactory manner. I, however, have a neighbor, a practical
manâ a mechanic, a machinistâ who for nearly twenty years has been at work
upon a machine for tnreshing flax, which he has at last perfected, which he has
tried upon a small scale, and which to that extent has proved entirely satis
factory, according to the recorded verdict of those well competent to judge,
whose testimony is upon record and can readily be procured. His claims for it,
which seem to be well substantiated, are that it will save 25 per cent of the seed
which Is lost by the present mode of threshing and will protect the fiber from in
jury, rendering it valuable for manufacture In any form desired. He has the
machine in working order on his own premises, where it can be seen and its
movements studied, and he is ready to go with it into the field whenever the sea
son for it opens, with full confidence of its success, but, as he says himself, he
has made and kept himself so poor in working to perfect it that he finds him
self unable to move it and put it into operation where it can be rendered
available for practical use. I wish he might be aided to do so, for if successful,
which there is every reuson to believe that It would be, It would increase the
value of the flax crop by a very large per cent and so give an impulse to its
cultivation that would add greatly to the resources and industrial wealth of the
State. Or, If anything better can be produced, let that have the preference.
Only let us avail ourselves of such advantages as are presented to us and not
let our opportunities pass while we bemoan the evil of overpopulation and the
lack of employment, which render so many unable to earn a livelihood.
The inventor of the machine referrod to has made the culture and manu
facture of flax a careful study for many years and has a collection of literature
upon both branches of the subject that it would be Instructive and profitable
for any one interested in it to peruse.
My interest in this matter has been aroused by a correspondence I have re
cently had with "ertain persons in the flax-growing districts of Idaho and
Eastern Washington, but being an old Callfornian and an advocate of encourag
ing home industries and believing that the nearer home we can get in our efforts
the better for us and those, our neighbors, to whom we are under the greatest
obligations, I write as, 1 do and I hope that with your strong and vigorous pen
to reinforce my utterances they will prove at least a factor in the process of
stimulating some of our public-spirited business men to prompt and vigorous
action In the case. JAMES WOOD WORTH.

THE TRUST HAS COME TO STAY.
Editor The Call: In an editorial on "Government In Business" which recently
appeared In your Journal there Is a statement of current thought which should
challenge the attention of all who take an interest in the general welfare â too
many do notâ and It reads thus: "The best and broadest opportunities of man
have be^n afforded in this republic, under its wise and tried constitution, and
the social state that has been founded en the civil state which that constitution
creates. The great Individual fortunes of which the Examiner complains are
merely the result of the opportunities furnished man In this republic."
So runs current thought, The thought of nine- men out of ten of practical
bueiness intelligence, and they will agree with The Call and defend its position.
But what will the tenth man say? He will not question the statement made by
The Call as relating to the opportunities of the past; but he will ask. What of
the present? Are like opportunities available for every one capable of "self
denial, economy and thrift?" And what of the future?
% The Call will concede, as any one will, that changes have occurred In recent
years which greatly limit "the best and broadest opportunities of man" to rise in
this republic from poverty to affluence. A chief factor in producing these changes
which now seriously limit a man's opportunities is the trust, in competitii
which the individual is powerless and helpless. And the trust has come I
for no law can be made to dissolve or regulate a trust which will not also dis
solve or regulate any corporation or company, or even a partnership. The trust
has come in the natural order of business evolution, and unfriendly legislation or
loud denunciation will not even hinder its onward march to victory over compe
tition and individualistic enterprise, except such minor affairs as cannot be so
combined as to produce largo revenues.
Clearly, then, we must reckon with the trust, and Just what that m^ans very
few people yet begin to realise. I can pause but to name a single example. !-â¢ t
UB tfike a household article fnmillar to all. It is not long since baking powders
wore much advertised in every daily and weekly newspaper, and pushing
men urged rales of their rival brands with untiring persistence. All thai Is now
changed. No advertising ami no salesmen ;tre needed by the baking powder
trust. You pay your money ami take your choii <â . Bul what has become of
those salesmen, with their families? AVith rare exception they are in thi
of the unemployed. L,ike results attend enoh new aggregation of capital and
business ability known as a trust, and although no power In the Legislature or in
the courts can dissolve a trust or prevent its growth, I can yel say that 1 welcome
the trust, for I regard it as the best teacher of economics the world has known.
But what shall we do with the increasing number of men who are und<
the terrors of enforced idleness? Ordinary prudence would suggest th;;' pro
vision be made for them; that employment be found for them, since no one de
sires to see them degraded by poverty and by degrees driven to deeds of violence
and turned into outlaws. Shall we keep them in subjection by a standing sirmy?
Is that a good way for society to protect Itself from men with hungry families
grown desperate? It is idle to hope that these men will get along somehow and
remain good citizens.
Why not get them together in co-operative colonies where they can produce
by their own labor enough to provide for themselves rind their familii
properly rear their children? "Would this not he less expensive, more in harmony
with civilization, more humane, more satisfactory any way, than to iner>
police f<T. â < and the standing army? Can it nol be done in a business way and
be made a civilizing influence at the same time?

COMMENDABLE OPPOSITION TO IMPERIALISM.
To the Editor of The Call: It is a hopeful indication that even one of the big
dallies of California opposes Imperialism. The Call d< mmendatl*
its abl< and logical opposition to a government policy regarding foreign terri
torj which threatens to submerge the principles' of our forefathers and th< plain
teachings ol the Federal constitution beneath the billows ot popular reckless
ness. Until recently it looked as If the whole- country had gone dafl on the
Question of appropriating as part of our national possessions every island and
group Of Islands, far and near, which can possibly be BCOOped in by the dr..
of Imperialism. But recently there have appeared many indications of a reac
tionâa change in public sentiment that furnishes ground for hope that our
country may yet be saved from the fatal plunge.
Before trying to oivilise and assimilate â  large portion of the savage races
in distant countries, would it not be well for us to tirsi attain a higher de(
of civilization ourselves? Lel us at least wait till we have settled th<
question, the Indian question, the labor Question and a few other domestic
problems which are ever and anon causing trouble In various forms and threat
ening the overthrow of our free institutions. This suggestion may not seem ex
actly patriotic, but my notion is that the Best and truest patriotism is that
which will make our own country permanently prosperous, peaceful and happy.
Apaln i desire to commend The "'all for its opposition to a foreign policy
which, if persisted in, will inevitably lead to national ruin.

FAVORS BOYCOTTING OF ASIATIC LABOR
Editor San Francisco Call: As an American I object to all white men and
women employing: Chinese and Japanese laborer? in any shape or form and
leaving out white men and women who earn their daily bread. AYe will take
for instance the orchard men. Whites purchase all of the fruits. I think It
would be a good idea to boycott all fruits where Chinese and Japanese are em
ployed in orchards, also every place where they are employed.

SCOTT & qOffiia. UfflÃUSfr NÂ«W YÂ«hCOOK OF THE
HIRAM BINGHAM
RILLS HIMSELF
Missionary Boat Short
of Provisions.
DRINKING WATER WAS VILE
SAILS HAD TO BE MADE OUT OF
OLD BEAN SACKS.
Five Men From the Wrecked Whaler
Horatio Shipped on Her and
One of Them Committed
Suicide.
The missionary schooner Hiram Bing
ham wont to Oakland Creek yesterday,
and her crew was along the front during
the day for the first time since th. little
vessel made port. The men say they had
a terrible time of It during the voyage
from Kusaie to San Francisco. Accord-
Ing to them the Blngham was short-hand- '
ed, short of provisions, short of water,
Bhort of sails, and in fact short of every- .
thing except prayers and Bible readings.
During the voyage the cook committed
f-uicide, and the men had to make sails
out of sacks In order to get the vessel ,
Into port.
The Hiram Blngham has been in the [
Fouthern seas for nearly four years. The
American Board of Foreign Missions has
a large training school for native teachers
at Kusaie, and the schooner has been em
ployed in carrying these teachers from \
the school to the various islands in the
Gilbert group and bringing other natives J
back to receive an education. In her four \
years of service a native crew under Cap- j
tain "Walkup has handled her, but when ;
she was ready to come home a white j
crew had to be secured. Just as she wai I
ready to sail the whaling bark Horatio 'â 
was wrecked and five of her crew shipped
on the Hiram Bingham. They were
Charles Towers, Frank Kldridgo, James
Barry, "William Olsen and Otto Kyeer.
The latter was appointed cook of the mis
sionary boat, and Towers was made mate.
The vessel was sixty-three days getting
here from Kusale.
"It was the worst voyage I have ever
made" said Charles Towers yesterday,
"nnd I have had some pretty tough times
of it in the Arctic. We were short of pro
visions, our principal article of food be
ing rice, and that we had frequently to
eat raw, as there was no water to boll it
in. The water we had was something
awful. We strained It and boiled it, but
the more we tinkered with It the worse
it smelled. During that passage I ate five j
in mnds of tobacco a day to stay my stom
ach, and the other boys did the same.
The Id man (Captain Walkup) lived on
faith and prayer. We also prayed, but
his were said in the cabin and ours were
eai.i on the forecastle head. We met
nothing but light winds and calms In the J
trades, and calms and light winds after
we crossed the equator.
"Otto Kyser, the ok, was taken sick
before we reached the equator. He was
able to be around, but the grub did not
agree with him and he grew despondent.
At 4 a. m. one day he was missed, and
we searched the ship. In one of the clos- !
ets we found him dead. He had procured j
a thin heaving line and hanged himself to i
the roof of the closet. He had to bend j
his Ifps. under him In order to commit the ,
desperate deed. Beside him was a carv- <
ing-knife as sharp as a razor, and I sup- !
pose that his first intention was to cut,
his throat. We buried him after a break- i
fast of beans and vile water.
â¢â¢The Bingham was very hard to navl- j
pate, because we had no headsails. The
men K'U together and made a lib out of
two sacks, and the foresail we patched
up with odds and ends and made it do.
Had it not been for these we would never
have reached San Francisco. No more ,
cruises in a missionary schooner for me. j
Give me a whaler every time."
The Hiram Bingham Is to be sold and
replaced by a larger vessel. During her j
lour years of service her sails were worn |
out; and that was how her canvas came i
vo be in such a condition. Captain Walk- j
up never figured on taking over two j
months to get to San Francisco, and that ,
accounts fur the shortage of provisions
and water. _^____^______

will the crowd assembled prepared to
follow the advice of the speaker.
The arrangement of the hall is
directed to the comfort of the visitors
as well as to the desire for beauty and
artistic effects. A dozen pretty booths
line the walls, displaying their wares
in a most tempting manner. In the
center of the hall the floral booth
stands, attractive in outline and gor
geous in its wealth of floral loveliness.
Sweets find a place on the stand with
the flowers, and the same pretty girls
who so deftly dispose of fragrant blos
soms dispense toothsome bonbons.
A very popular booth last evening
was the Irish kitchen with its large
open hearth, spinning-wheel and the
many other quaint accessories of the
old country kitchen. Irish fig dancing
was a feature In the booth. Messrs.
O'Connor and Kelleher led in the
merry measure and were assisted by
the Misses Cavanagh and Miss Julia

the bagpipe
At the "Brownie Wheel" J. M. Sulli

JOSEPH GRAFE DEAD.
j Popular Member of the Schuetzen
Verein Falls a Victim to Heart
Disease.
Joseph Grafe, proprietor of the Market
Exchange at 540 Clay street, died sud
denly yesterday morning under circum
stances which at first would lead to the
belief that he had committed suicide, but
a close examination of the premises con
vinced the Morgue officials that his death
was purely the result of accident.
Grafe resided with his wife at 615 Polk
street, but, his barkeeper having left him
last Wednesday, he told his wife that he
would Bleep in the saloon that night so as
to open up the place when his new as
sistant, C Repen, arrived at 6 o'clock yes
terday morning. Repen arrived according
to agreement, but was unable to obtain
any response to his summons. He there
upon went to Grafe' a bouse, thinking that
he had not slept In the saloon after all.
Qrafe's wife was very much alarmed and
went to The saloon at once with Repen
and forced an entrance. They found Grafe
lying dead on the floor by a gas stove
which he used- for cooking the saloon
lunch.
The room was full of the fumes of gas
and one of the stopcocks of the stove was
fully turned on. Grafe had his pantaloons
and shoes, on and his undershirt, he hav
ing apparently Just got out of bed. A
match which had been lighted, but which
had been extinguished before it had
burned any of the wood, was found on
top of the stove, together with two
matches which had not been lighted. The
theory is that Grafe got up to light the
fire, that he turned on the gas in the
stove, at the same time striking a match,
and that before he could apply the match
he fell dead on the floor where he was
afterward found by his distracted wife.
Grafe was a stout man and had been
complaining of heart disease for some
time, and It is believed that his death was
due to that cause. The dead man was a
popular member of the Schuetzen Verein
and of the American Legion of Honor.
An inquest will be held.

dicted and those who were elected to form
vacancies had shrewdly guessed what was
coming, but still there was something
sudden in the way it was done.
The blow came in the form of an order
signed by the three Commissioners. As
soon as the session opened President Kil
burn handed the order to the secretary
with Instructions to read It. It was spread
upon the minutes and then the board pro
ceeded to other business. The order was
as follows.
For the purpose of reorganizing the em
ployes â¢â : the Board of Harbor Commissioners,
the following order Is made;
That on and after May 1. 1899, the follow
ing positions under the board are declared va
cant and the same are hereby abolished:
Superintendent of urgent repairs, *22." per
month; assistant superintendent of urgent re
pairs. $150; Janitor of the urgent repairs de
partment, $75; purchasing agent, $175; purchas
ing agent's Janitor and storekeeper, $75; pur
chasing agent's wagon and driver, $12.".. ser
geant of police and two policemen, $27"; three
Janitors at $75 each, $225; Janitor, *&â¢: six
sweepers at $CO, f360; night engineer ferry build
in*. $100.
That the salary of the suptrmtenUe'it of the
union depot and ferry building be reduced
from $150 to $125 per month; that the salary
of the head electrician 1"' increased from V.":
to $100 per month; that the salary of the as
sistant electrician be changed from $3 per day
to $90 per month; and that upon the com
pletion of the structure Intended for Well*.
Fargo & Co. the two helpers of the electrician
be dismissed.
Those included are L. F. Long, superin
tendent of urgent repairs: Frank P.
Hughes, his assistant; and Max Wagner.
his janitor; J. J. Flynn, purchasing agent;
.1 S. McMann, his storekeeper; and
T. N. Hanly, a driver; Henry W. Peter
son, sergeant of the Harbor police, and
Charles Bowen, night engineer. The two
Harbor policemen will be decided upon
later, as will the Janitors and the sweep
ers. ,:';â â â â :'
The following appointments were made:
M. E. Arnerich. wharfinger, vice D. .A.
Marina, term expired; Frank P. Car
michael, wharfinger, vice M. Mellican, at
the expiration of his term, June 27, 1899;
John Nolan, 415 Clementina street, vice
William Barrett, removed from position
as watchman on floating pile-driver.
A committee from th â  Chamber of Com
merce was present to discuss dockage fa
cilities with the Commissioners. Those
forming the committee were John Dol
beer, Robert Dollar. K. G. Chapman, W.
H. Marston and E. E. Kentneld. The
Chamber of Commerce expects a great in
crease In the shipping to this port in
view of the acquisition of the Pacific
Islands, and the committee was appoint
ed to see how far the commission would
go in the building of docks and wharves.
There was no complaint about present fa
cilities and the committee made it plain
that there was no criticism on the pres
ent rate of tolls; it was only in regard
to increased facilities to meet the ex
pected increase in the shipping.
Commissioner Harney was primed for
the occasion and explained the extent of
the present dockage accommodations. He
said there is over seven miles of wharf
frontage from section }i of the seawall
to Third and Berry streets. This, he
said, was sufficient to accommodate 120
ships each 300 Feet long. At present there
are thirty-eight deep-water vessels in
port, twenty-two of which are at the
docks and sixteen in the Stream awaiting
places.
It was further explained to the commit
tee that the fact of a vessel .lying out in
the stream awaiting a chance to dis
charge did not necessarily argue that
there was no room for her at the wharf.
Consignees seek to have- their cargoes dis
charged at some wharf close to their
warehouses and frequently keep vessels
waiting while such location Is being used
by some other vessel. This it was ex
plained was something that would hap
pen under any circumstances and in
creased facilities would not alter the sit
uation.
The entire question was discussed from
all aspects and the committee departed
With the assurance from the commission
that anything to better the water front
of the city would receive its most care
ful attentloji.
In Paris one person in eighteen lives on
charity.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 27.â Stocks opened ip this
morning, and after moderate fluctuations either
way. slid oft below yesterday's prices. There
were advices of crop damage, sterling ex
change was strong at higher figures, and call
money was at 'the l^gal rate, six per cent, in
the afternoon, all of which combined to send
prices off with a rush, and the market closed
weak under pressure. The demand for money
â¢was incidental to the preparations of corpora- j
tlons to meet May disbursements, and there i
â¢was a disposition among traders to anticipate j
a Dosslble squeeze in call money to-morrow, ,
when leans carry over to Monday. There was j
moderate arbitrage buying for London account j
early, and the traders also were prominent |
buyers, but the diminishing commission house
bu-<infss prompted them to switch their posi
tion and call for a turn. The trading â¢in a
half million shares was practically all for pro
fessional operations. Silver certificates repre
senting l<"!0,0fl0 ounces changed lands at Fr in
63% to 64%. the latter being the highest figure
In over two years. The bull speculation In sil
ver as well as dividend gossip Imparted strength .
to Denver and HIo Grunde issues. Anaconda
MJnlng had over 3 points knocked off from Its
recent advance on liquidation Induced by the
denial of a large interest that the proposed
copper trust had control of the property. Man
hattan Beach dropped 7 points, with little re
covery on stop-h>ss orders being reached. New
York Airbrake sold up "14 points, the greater
.part of which it held on the approach of the
judicial decision which friends of the company i
hope will be favorable. Delaware, Lacka- I
wanna and Western recovered from yesterday's !
depression, which was connected with rumors j
Of pending !abor difficulties. The heaviness I
of the market was accentuated by free selling j
of Brooklyn Transit and Sugar, although an I
earlier rise in Sugar was on an intangible ru- |
nrnr that the company would offer rights to ;
subscribe for the issue of stock at :>ar. to be :
used in connection with some deal with rival j
Interests.
Further improvements were made in all the I
standard railway mortgages to-day, and some I
new flotations were also taken at Improved J
figures. Total sales, 54.195.000.
United States twos registered and the threes
declined '' 4 . and United States threes coupon,

Francisco Tells of a
Deal That Failed.
LOSES WIFE AND COIll
THE COURT TESTIFIES THAT IT
HAD BEEN ENGAGED.
Miss Moss. However, Seemed in
Favor With the Jury and Was
Given All the Damages
She Asked.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
POS Broadway, April 27.
Miss Alirr- Moss was granted her heart's
desire by a jury this afternoon in Judge
Qulnn's court. She triumphed over her
ex-lover, Manuel Francisco, and was
awarded $299 damages for spending three
days in the City Prison on the strength
of a warrant sworn to by Francisco.
Francisco lost his affianced, $60 he gave
her for a wedding dross, the costs of
court and the verdict of $203, besides hav
ing heaped upon him the humiliation
caused by the Jeers and laughter of a
small crowd of the lady's friends who
thronged the courtroom. One of these
friends was so demonstrative during the
trial that Judge Qulnn ordered her out of
the courtroom, and she spent the remain
der of the day smiling at the witnesses
from the corridor.
Francisco went on the stand this after
noon and told his little tale of love. He
narrated how Mis? Alice Moss had ac
cepted his proposal of marriage, had al
lowed him to name the day and had taken
from him $60 for the purpose of purchas
ing a wedding trousseau. On the eve of
the wedding day the young lady declined
to have anything further to do with Man
uel, who is over twice her ag*e. Manuel
then secured her arrest on the charge of
obtaining money by false pretenses. She
was, as her attorney said, "thrown into
the deep, damp i ells of the City Prison
and there the innocent young woman
languished for three whole days."
Some of the testimony did not
agree with Miss Moss' attorney's
assumption of Innocence, youthful
ness and prettiness, but evidently these
characteristics of the plaintiff made a
very favorable impression upon the jury,
at whom she smiled the whole of the
eleven hours that the trial was in prog
ress.
Manuel's attorney placed Judge Quinn
on the stand for the purpose of showing
how thoroughly in earnest his client was
in regard to the marriage. "The failure
of the attempt on the part of the de
fendant to marry the plaintiff was some
what of a disappointment to me," said
the court. "Francisco had called on me
and made arrangements or me to go to
his home on the Sunday evening and per
form the ceremony. He was to send a
hack for me, but as events developed
I missed the hack drive. It is my opinion
that Francisco was talking business when
he made the arangement with me."
The witness then transformed himself
into the court again and the case pro
ceeded.
Attorney D. Mitchell, on behalf of Miss
Alice M"o88, made a very eloquent plea,
referring to his legal opponents, Abe P.
.Leach and Clarence Croweli, as "two of J
the most gallant young, men Jn Oakland,
who would. 1 sincerely believe, despise
doing anything that would inure to the i
detriment of my client."
Attorney Leach evidently did not take
the same view of matters as Mr. Mitchell,
for he argued very earnestly and in a
manner that clearly showed it to be his
opinion that the fair Alice was not en
titled to a cent. During the argument
Mr. Mitchell inadvertently stated that he
and his associate, Frank Brearty, had
divide between them the $60 which
should have gone for the wedding gown.
The case will be appealed to the Su
perior Court/

WHERE SOLDIERS MAY READ.
A Canvas Library Erected at the '
Presidio by the Red Cross.
The reading tent erected at the Presidio
by the Red Cross Society was opened with
I an entertainment last evening. Every Cor
ner of the canvas structure was filled
with the soldiers, and there was enthu
siasm enough for a regiment. They
cheered and shouted at the songs, anec
j dotes and speeches, and it was not until
after tattoo that the audience left the
tent and the men sought their quarters.
The programme was under the direc
tion of the Rev. O. < '. Miller, who is act-
I ing as post chaplain. Those who lent
their aid were Miss Place, Mr?. Baum
garten, Miss McMurray, "Jack" Hines
and Private Reed of the Twenty-fourth
Infantry.
There are over fifteen hundred men at
the Presidio now, and they have had no
place but their own quarters in which ;
to spend their leisure. Rev. Mr. Miller
has been devoting himself to the men
' at the post ever since the Eighth Califor
nia Volunteers, of which be was chap
lain was mustered out. Mrs. A. W. Scott
of the Red Cross Society has also been a
constant visitor at the Presidio, and she
and Mr. Miller conceived the plan of pro
viding the men with a reading tent. Do- j
nations of books were not long in com
ing and the enterprise was successful. ;
Now that the tent has been opened, Mrs.
Scott will be in attendance every day.
Periodicals- will be kept on file, and let
ter stationery will also be furnished all
who are not in a position to buy it. There
will also be entertainments at frequent j
intervals. A fund for the purchase of!
stamps is one of the things the tent
workers want, and also ' comfort bags, :
such as were distributed to the. men dur
ing the early part of the war. Money to i
furnish the place Is another necessity, but
all these things are expected to come in
time. Anything sent to the headquarters j
â¢ of the Red Cross Society for the reading j
i tent will find its way to its destination.

HOWARD'S GOLD
WAS A PUZZLE
FOR THE JUDGE
A Big Bail Bluff Was
Quickly Called.
DOUBLE EAGLES GALORE
FIVE HUNDRED YKLLOW BOYS
APPEARED IN COURT.
Fred Foster's Effort to Get Even
Placed Justice Morris in a Di
lemma Over Too Much
Cash.
ALAMEDA, April 27.â Fred Foster, who I
has been prosecuted by A. Howard, the '
racetrack plunger, for the alleged theft
of a pair of horses valued at $15,00>J, :
turned the tables on Howard to-day by
having him arrested on a charge of per- ;
jury. The complaint was sworn to be- '
fore Justice Morris, and the alleged per- i
jury upon whi< h It is based consists of |
the statements made by Howard before
Justice Quinn of Oakland Township on
April 3. when he had a warrant issued
for Foster on a felony charge.
The warrant for Howard was placed in j
the hands of Constable Gray, who served
it in San Francisco late this afternoon.
"What is the bail?" inquired Howard.
"Ten thousand dollars, cash," was the
reply. To the Constable's amazement ;
Howard produced the necessary amount
in $20 gold pieces. Gray hired Kelly, the i
well-known Jockey, to help him carry the i
coin to Alamedd. When the sack was
deposited in Justice Morris' court this '
evening the Judge nearly fell off the |
bench. He thought the Constable was
playing a joke on him, but when he
opened the sack and found it was filled
with the genuine article he began to ap
preciate that he was dealing with a de- I
fendant of some importance.
It suddenly dawned on the Judge that it '
was long after banking hours, and he was
assuming considerable responsibility as
the custodian of so much wealth. James
P. Sweeney, attorney for Howard, ap
peared in court, and at Judge Morris' sug
gestlon readily i onsented to have the !
ball reduced to $1250. With this amount
In his pockets the Judge visited nearly
every store in town that boasted of a
safe and deposited small portions of the
cash until he finally got rid of it all.
Howard's preliminary hearing has not
yet been set.

RAPID UPWARD JUMP
IN SILVER VALUES
SMELTER TRUST IS AT THE BOT
TOM OF IT.
Combination Pursuing Its Avowed
Policy of Advancing the Price
of the White Metal.
The Budden upward jump of Bilver in
London and New York has caused no end
of comment in local financial and mining
circles. From the condition of a drug on
tho market for months, the white metal
appears to be assuming some commerlcal
importance, the amount of which no one
at present in the city appears t>> be will
inK to predict. Opinions concerning the
causes leading to the betterment of the
market are lnd< flnite, bui the? one thai
has Rained mo?t ground Is that the
smelter trust recently formed, the Ameri
can Smelting and Refining Company, is
fit the bottom of tlii- advance, carrying:
out its announced policy of raising the
price of the metal 1') per rent from that
ruling at the time of the formation of the
t rusl .
"< Mir advices concerning the rise in
silver," Bald Thomas Brown, cashier of
the Hank of Califonia, "are to the effect
that it is due to the combination known
as the American Smelting ami Refining
Company recently formed in New Vm-k
with a capital 0* $66,000,000. It controls
smelters in Colorado, Utah and Montana,
and appears to have tho situation will in
hand ami rules the mark< t for silver. I
think silver will go higher, but that de
pends entirely upon the demand for it."
T. B. Underbill, secretary of the Selby
Smelting Company, is of a similar
opinion, and dispatches received here late
yesterday afternoon from New York are
to the effect that the advance Is merely
speculative, no Increase in commercial de
mand appearing in any quarter. Mining
men do not appear to think that tin ad
vance means anything over which they
are called upon to rejoice. The white
metal is at present too far in the dumps
for any short spurt like the present to
have a particular effect on its produc
tion. For months silver has ruled around
Mi., in New York, with nobody appearing
to care much one way or the 'other. The
advance came last Friday, wh'-n it went
up half a cent. This was followed the
next day by another advance, bar silver
closing at 61.
Yesterday silver certificates represent
ing 40.000 ounces wrre purchased on the
New York Stock Exchange from 63^4 to
04 4 . the price of commercial bar being
63V 4 . The last time the metal reached G4

TO A BOGUS SUICIDE
ENGINEEB WILLIS' FIND AT THE
OLYMPIC PIER.
If Mrs. "Tom Boz?Je" is not a myth,
then the chances are that her body is be
ing buffeted about by the breakers out
nÂ«ar the Cliff House.
When Chief Engineer Willis of the
Olympic Salt Water Company went out
on the pier that Juts into the o^ean near
the life-saving station about 9 o'clock yes
weeks, Saturday and Sunday mati
nees only of course. Seats is a
nickel. We paid 10 cents for one
when the gang went to the Alham
bra."
Besides tending to' the casting of
the play Schwalbe will do a "Dutch
turn" at the end of the last act with
his partner, Leo Kutner. The many
annoyances connected with play
pirating Schwalbe hopes to avoid In
the future by inducing the proprietors
of the Western stock to turn their at
tention entirely to vaudeville. "Dewey,
the Hpi-o of Manila." will be cast to
the full extent of the company, which
includes Fred Batkins, Leon Kutner,
Monroe Schwalbe. Howard de Cour
cey, Isaac Harris, Melvin Stolks,
Grover Magnin, Milton Cohn, M. Sills,
Byron Batkins, Horace Seaman,
Mendes Harris and Llllie Blank. Five
more names ar"> to be added to the
list, and the additional ones will al
ternately go to make up the Spanish
army and American navy.
But one maiden has the honor of
belonging to the distinguished com
pany, and she is not a leading lady.
Monroe J. Schwalbe.
Miss Blank will play a very Inferior
part in the production, as the man
agement quotes feminine talent at a
very low figure.
The female roles In "Dewey" have
been intrusted to the tender care of
Fred Batkins and Howard de <\>ur
cey. Batkins is the leading lady of
th>- show. "I play a Spanish girl," ex
plained Batkins, "and as I wear a
shawl over my head I won't even
have to wear a wig."
Master Grover Magnin is to imper
sonate the hero of Manila, and has al
ready secured the blonde mustache
which the buys declare makes his re
semblance to the ereat man perfect.
X'nfortunately for Magnin the play only
permits of Dewey's appearance in the
last act. and so the stage manager
has taxed the youthful actor with two
other small parts â that of a negro in
Fred Batkins.
i
the first act and Captain Cook in the a
second. a
As the desire to see Dewey in the 1
neighborhood of Bush street is most ;?
intense Isaac Harris and Melvin 1
Stolks. proprietors of the Western j
Btock company, confidently expect to X
clear $2 at each performance. \
terday morning he found a woman's black
straw bat, ilotted veil, a pair of shabby
black kid gloves, a tattered white silk
handkerchief, a much-worn purse, three
letters, a photograph and an empty two
ounce bottle labeled "carbolic acid." All
the articles were of the cheapest possible
description, and their total value would
not exceed 10 cents. Mr. Willis took the
articles to the Central police station, and
Detectives Egan and Silva were ordered
to make an Investigation.
The three letters are brief, and there
arc several things in connection with
them that lead to the suspicion that they
are the work of some practical joker. Two
of them are ostensibly from the woman's
husband.
The third letter is signed by the
woman herself, and reads:
April 26. 1599.
To the Public of San Francisco: This is
my last hour on earth, and I beg tn inform
you why I have taken my life. My husband
'If the cause erf it all. He thought that I was
false, hut I've been as faithful aa a wife
could lie. I will take carbolic acid bo that
I will 1* sure that my life will be ended if
I do not drown. I do not leave any one after
me but my dear mother. Mrs. Jones, who re-
Btdei at i2,"i Tehama street. Dear soul. My
faithless husband has deserted me for another
woman. Her name In Miss Bkeeter. I hope
God will have merry on her. as I have lived
hell on earth. Earth has no charms for me.
Break the news very gently to my mother,
as she has heart failure and the blow will
kill hÂ°r. Yours in the hour of death.
MRS. T. Hn/.ZLE.
The last letter was written in back
hand, but the formation of many of the
letters was almost Identical with those
in the first two, and besides all three were
written with ink of the same quality and
color. All three were in one envelope, ad
dressed "Mrs. Tom Bozzle, General De
livery, City," and stamped 8 p. m., April
25. It Is singular that the man should
write to his wife through the general de
livery. Then there is that name "Miss
Skeeter" in the last lettrr that sounds
like a joke. But most suspicious is the
name and address of the alleged suicide's
mother, "Mrs. Jones, 12r> Tehama street."
At that number there is a brewery, and
nobody on the street knows a Mrs. Jones.
In the Divorce Court.
Rose A. Williams has been granted a
divorce from Francis A. Williams, on the
ground of habitual intemperance. Annie
E. Dennis was granted a divorce yester
day from William .1. W. Dennis, on the
ground of cruelty. John Dineley has sued
Mattie Dineley for a divorce, alleging in
fidelity as a cause of cumplaint. George
Helmken asks for a divorce from Helen
Helmken nil the same ground.
Big Bonded Indebtedness.
. The bonded indebtedness of the Oak
land Water Company has been increased
$1,500,000, the bonded Indebtedness of th,>
company now aggregating: $2,500,000. The
certificate of the increase was filed yes
terday by W. J. Dingee, president, and
Andrew Rose, secretary of the corpora
tion.
Hopps-Owen Nuptials.
ALAMEDA, April 27.â The wedding of
Miss Lizzie J. Hopps and "William Owen
was celebrated last night at the home of
the bride's mother, Mrs. Ellen R. Hopps,
IX2O Central avenue. Ray. T. J. Lacey,
rector of Christ Episcopal Church, per
formed the ceremony. Only the imme
diate relatives and intimaU 1 friends of the
contracting parties were present. Mr. and
Mrs. Owen will make a wedding tour of
five or six weeks through Oregon and
Washington, after which they will reside
In AJnmeda. The groom is a member of
the firm of Kre^s & Owen of New Tork
and has charge of the concern's affairs
on the Pacific Coast.

C. P. HUNTINGTON IS
FEASTED AND EXALTED
BY HIS ASSOCIATES
Vice President Stubbs Displays Rare
Genius and Diplomacy in Seat
ing the Guests.
George Crocker, as the Leader of the Fourteen
Banquet-Givers, Occupies the High Posi
tion of Host â Speech of the
Guest of Honor.
THE expanded banquet given in
honor of Collia P. Huntington at
the Palace Hotel last evening by
fourteen officers of the South
ern Pacific was an affair worthy
of our blessed railroad aristocracy. Ac
cording to inside information obtained
from the yellow building the dinner
was tendered to President c. P. Hunt
ington and Vice President General
Hubbard by the following general offi
cers of the company: George Crocker,
second vice president; J. C. Stubbs,
third vice president: Julius Krutt
pohnitt, fourth vice president; W. F.
Herrin, head of the law department
and promoter of United States Sena
tors: William Hood, chief engineer;
N. T. Smith, treasurer; E. C. Wright,
secretary and controller: William
Sproule, freight traffic manager; W.
H. Mills, head of the land department;
1 >r. Gardner, hospital corps; J. A. Fill
more, manager of the Pacific Coast de
partment; T. H. Goodman, general pas
senger agent; R. P. Schwerin, Pacific
HOW THE GUESTS WERE SEATED.
Mall general agent; Jerome Madden,
land agent.
\V. H. Mills of the land and literary
department maintains that the function
v>as private, and therefore resents
press comment on the "social event."
He goes so far in the expression of his
displeasure as to threaten the aggre
gate resentment of the fourteen rail
roaders who conceived and executed the
scheme for an expanded feast. It is
worth passing comment here to ob
eerve that Mills was discovered by the
late Leland Stanford and for many
years basked in the sunshine of Stan
ford's favor. When the Huntington
regime came Into power Mills readily
transferred his allegiance to the new
king and excluded the word "gratitude"
from his lexicon. Without going Into
details concerning the story of lost ad-
I miration The Call simply calculates
that Mills represents one-fourteenth of
I the aggregate resentment entertained
for this paper in the yellow building,
and his one-fourteenth is duly recorded.
The merchants invited to meet Mr.
Huntington gracefully accepted the in
vitation. The company ab dinner num
i bered one hundred and fifty-four and
, represented much of the wealth and en
; terprise of San Francisco. The ban
; quet was a success, and when the credii
of the achievement belongs to fourteen
men it may seem a little invidious, if
1 not ungracious, to single out one rail
roader for special praise. It is cmi
, nently proper, however, that the mas
terly genius of Vice President J. C.
Stuhbs should receive more than pass
ing recognition. This recognition is ac
-1 corded with no design to detract a
single laurel from that accomplished
! political manager, W. P. Herrin, the
light of the law department. The great
j achievement of the banquet was the
: skillful manner in which Vice President
Stubbs classified the attendants. The
chart Itself is a living example of his
genius. Gaze upon it from any point
of view and the masterly hand and
head of the third vice president may
be recognized. When the chart is
placed on an even keel it is observed
that George Cracker is at the head of
the table. Counting the number, fif
teen, seated in the high official zone
seven will be found to the right and
seven to the left of Second Vice Presi
dent Crocker. C. P. Huntington is the
first to Mr. Crocker's right Seven is
the divine number, and Mr. Hunting
ton is first of the seven, to the right,
recollect. Veer the chart around a lit
tle bit and Huntington is made to ap
pear at the head of the table. Now as
George Crocker was the chief of 'the
fourteen tendering the banquet he oc
cupied as host the head of the table
On his right sat C. P. Huntington and
on his left General Hubbard. Mr.
Stubbs has good right to be proud of
his work. Yesterday he admonished the
press, no matter what comment might

be made of the function, to beware of
tampering -with the chart. The genius
of Ptubbs, which elevated George
Crocker to- the nephew's position, may
some day put the same George on the
throne. And Mills will float in on the
first tide.
Governor Gape and D. M. Burns
were not present. Had the Governor
been there he could have responded
with his usual eloquence to the toast,
"One Might as Well Be Killed for a
SCENE AT THE BANQUET AT THE PALACE.
Sheep as a Lamb." The absence of
Colonel Burns must have been deeply
regretted. He could have elucidated
to the assembled company many of the
terms employed on the racetrack and
explained to Dr. Mackenzie and Rabbi
Voorsanger the difference between a
"lons shot" and "odds <>n."
No one can dispute the fact that the
banquet was a great success for a pri
vate function, yet It is regarded as de
plorable that Railroad Commissioners
Laumeister and Blaekstock were con
strained to remain away. Each one is
versatile and able to throw much light
on the process of "lightning change."
Either could tell how it is possible tor
i a candidate to change his mind sud-
I denly after he is elected to office.
The Stubbs chart, which nobody has
a right to monkey with, shows Rev,
Dr. Stebblns, Rabbi Vooraanger and
Rev. Dr. Mackenzie all placed within
the zone of the great and gifted. Only
Captain Nelson intervened between C.
P. Huntington and Dr. Mackenzie. As
close as the eminent clergyman was to
the president of the company he was
not bo far away from others as to fail
to keep an eye on Horace Platt. If not
closely watched at banquets Mr. Platt
will drift away from his early ortho
doxy.
The fourteen acted wisely and well in
asking three eloquent preachers to the
fpaPt, and Vice President Stubbs again
displayed a rare sense of the eternal
fitness of things in placing all three
near the president of the company. The
unkind suggestion has been thrown out
that many shippers were invited to
meet Mr. Huntington in order to an
ticipate the competition promised by
the Santa Fe. Surely no one would
imagine that the clergymen wore
sought to increase the worldly busi
ness of the company. The desire for
favor in another sphere is implied, and
perhaps favor is there needed.
At the banquet board last night there
was a departure from the old order of
exercises. The heads of the various
departments of the railroad institution
did not follow the time-worn practice
of exalting each other. There were no
special eulogies for the freight depart
ment or glowing tributes to the literary
bureau.
While the waiters were passing the
cafe noir to the guests J. C. Stubbs
rose from his seat and a painful hush
fell. Mr. Stubbs spoke of the necessity
for all pood workers of the community
to uplift the city and raise the State
to a commnnding position in the hier
archy of commonwealths. Without a
warning Mr. Stubbs relinquished his
right as lord high introducer and the
pride of the Southern Pacific, William
P. Herrin, placing his hands upon the
cloth, began his postprandial argu
ment.
"Let us now to the feast of reason,"
said the legal giant, and then the battle
<>f mnguts and profound thought be
pan. With a befitting sentiment W. H.
Mills was introduced.
"It is a custom of the Southern Pa
cific Company in banquet assembled,"
said Mills, "to inaugurate our literary
exercises by a patriotic song."
The national anthem was then sung
by the guests. Mr. Mills paid tribute
to the great protector of liberty in his
many protean shapes, Collis P. Hunt
ington. Before the chief had an oppor
tunity to rise the literary light of the
Central Pacific asked for a song, and
while the president was standing the
hall echoed with "For He's a Jolly
Good Fellow" until tears of joy began
to course the cheeks of the well-dined.
When the health of the chief guest
of the evening was proposed C. P.
Kuntington, president of the Southern
Pacific Company, responded, speaking
as follows:
Gentlemen of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and of San Francisco: I feel most es
pecially honored this evening, not alone
by your invitation but by the character
of the gentlemen whom, through your
courtesy, I have the pleasure to meet
pom.' for the first time. L have not been
asked to respond to any toast except tne
toast to my good health, and I think that
all of us can say that our good health is
the one particular thing upon which we
can afford to be most warmly congratu
lated. To be sure, the newspapers have
me practically "knocked out" every time
I visit the State, and I have learned to
expect as a usual episode accompanying
my sojourn among you here the receipt
of letters from New York asking anxious
ly whether I am "seriously ill." as the
newspaper dispatches state it; but I
manage generally to put in a full day's
work, and retire at night happy in the
consciousness of having earned my day's
wages, and with the added gratification
that I have been able, wifhout effort on
my own part, to furnish the newspapers
of your city with a news item of more or
less interest, according to the way one
looks at it. I feel sometimes that I have
been unduly favored by the press and
received much more than my fair share
of attention. But I do not see how it can
be avoided, and now that the anti-car
toon law has gone into effect I suppose
the attentions will be redoubled. But I
shall not make any denials, for 1 have
not the time to waste. In the Fremont-
Buchanan Presidential campaign I recol
lect that one of the charges made against
Fremont was that he was a Catholic,
and one of the opposing newspapers re-
Iterated the charge and said. "If he is
not a Catholic, why doesn't he come out
over his own signature and deny it?" The
Rochester Democratâ which, by the way,
was a Republican organ at that time
responded substantially like this: "We
pronounce James Buchanan an ass. If
he isn't an ass let him come out over his
own signature and deny it."
I am very glad to meet you here this
evening and to become acquainted witn
so many of San Francisco's prominent
business men. Having been all my life a
man of trade and tabor, I should stultify
myself if I did not say that I am a.
thorough believer in such men. I like to
talk with them, for they are up to date
in those things which round out charac
ter and excite the best energies of
humanity. It is with the go-ahead busi
ness men of Sun Francisco that the fu
ture and fortune of the city, as a city,
must always rest. It depends upon them
whether San Francisco shall be an ex
ample <>f enlightenment and progress for
ih" people of the whole State or whether
there shall be brighter lights for them to
follow.
I believe in the future of San Francisco.
She his a magnificent harbor near the
center of our coast line and Is right at
the gateway of the open sea. and as her
civilization and commerce grow greater
and greater she must forge ahead,
whether she will or not; bul there are
voices in your midst which do n< i help
you; there are agencies which rend ana
tear down, rather than create and build
up, and the railroad interests which l.
with my associates who arc present here
to-nigrht. and others, represent, is not one
i if those drawbacks.
It has been my constant statement in
the past, it is the same to-day, and will
be to-morrow, that the interest of the
railroad is so bound up with that of the
whole State that what affects the pros
perity of the one must reftect directly
upon the welfare of the other. If Cali
fornia to-day accommodated all the pop
ulation which she is able to support, and
support generously, the beginning of a
splendid era would be tipon us; and by
"us" I mean the people of the whole State.
There is nothing I so long to see in Cal
ifornia as the logical development of the
State; and, though 1 know this rightful
development would redound also to my
personal benefit. T can say this without a
particle of selfishness and without the
spirit of self-seeking in any respect.
I have lately had brought to my notice
and have urged the attention of my peo
ple here to the recent action of the Czar
of Russia, which is likely to result in a
heavy emigration of Finns to other and
more liberal countries. These thrifty peo
ple ought to find in California a benefi
cent harbor of refuge. I wish we could
gel them here; but. if we could, what
should we do with them? What have we
to offer them? Land? Yes; but can we
give them what they will need at a price
at which they can afford to acqure it?
That is the real question. England will
offer them great inducements; and so
will other countries. In the United States
the cold countries of the Northwest, will
present flattering inducements. In Cali
fornia we are concerned with the problem
of great ranches, the owners of which
have been unwilling to divide them up.
These people need small farms; and, if
they take them, the"y will take them only
at reasonable prices, for they cannot af
ford to pay more.
What California needs to-day is more
people. What you merchants neeed to
day is more customers to buy your goods;
and the only ivay you can get them is by
ha%-ing them here. California is a com
munity of large landholders, and a vast
region of lands that produce littleâ not
because they are unproductive but because
they are held in such large quantities that
they cannot be cultivated as they
should be.
One little colony of hard-working, eco
nomical, virtuous people like these Finns
would leaven the whole lump, for their
example would be an incitement to thou
sands of others, who, seeing their good
works and their good fortune, woulu
strive to share in it. So far as the Finns
at their far-away home are concerned,
neither you citizens of the State nor we
railroad people would need to advertise
further, for letters received at home from
the kindred who had successfully wan
dered into this land of milk and honey
would do the work, and I believe we
should find shiploads and carloads land
ing at the Golden Gate, ready to people
up our beautiful valleys and make this
land blossom like the rose. You may
consider this an extravagant picture, but
I think I am not an over-enthusiastic
man, and I look at a question of this kind
in the light of what history teaches us.
Great communities â nations â have
grown up from small beginnings and
through the force of example, and we
can hardly overestimate the vital impor
tance and value of securing the first
party of emigrantsâ whose eyes are even
now looking wistfully toward this land
of liberty, whose richest promises He
right here. The people who come here, to
settle among us do not ask the gift of
money: nor do they need it. They are
entitled, though, to fair and liberal treat
ment and the hand of good-fellowship:
to sympathy and the encouragement of
good wishes: for "one little word in kind
ness spoken" is often worth far more
than dollars.
I was in the mercantile business for
fifty-eight years, and through many of
the earlier years, during the gold excite
ment in California, in a community of
trade almost unique in the history of com
mercial incidents. One of my rules of
business was never to sell a man any
thing at a price which I thought pre
cluded him from getting his profit, for I
would rather send an article to the auc
tion-rooms and sell it for whatever it
might bring than to have the customer
buy and lose, for such is the better mer
cantile policy, to say nothing of the
right or wrong of the matter. I have
never wished for the reputation of being
a liberal man, but I have always given
weight and measure, not believing that
a man when he has paid his legal taxes
has given all he should give.
The poor we always nave with us and. l
have endeavored in a way to look out for
their interest, knowing that the rich and
forehanded can take care of themselves.
I have given money vhere I thought it
would do the most good, but giving work
is the best of all, for labor, in my opinion.
dignifies, while the acceptance of charity
tends to lower self-respect. A dollar leads
literally to nothing, but work may mean
all things. From small beginnings may
grow th/> greatest results.
T recollect, when the National Park
Bank building was in process of construc
tion in New York. T stopped one morning
in front of St. Paul's Church to watch for
a moment the workmen on the towering
chimney which I had seen steadily ris
ing in the air day aftor day until it had
attained a great height. My eye was fas
cinated by the careless, confident way in
which the workmen walked about at that
dizzy height, often with only a single
piece of planking between them and the
Bid( walk. 200 feet below, and I said to the
contractor: "Those men walk about on
that flimsy scaffold as carelessly as
though it was on the ground." "No,"
said he. "they are not careless at all.
They are simply sure, and are as safe
there as at the curb. You see," said he,
"they have gone up one brick at a time,
and they are as much at home on the
topmost course as on the first." It struck
me then that this was a valuable lesson,
applied to our dally life. We must build
slowly if we would be sure. We must rise
gradually, step by step, if we would keep
our heads.
So, too, in our treatment of others, if
we nave fortunately reached the higher
plane ourselves, let uh not fall to recollect
that we owe a duty to those toiling ones

as we did the steps that we have trod.
It Is a question of â uimanity. Neithor
race nor oreed can become a" reason for
our Indifference or neglect, and a man's
patent of nobility .should bÂ»Â» his wllling
to do good honest work. We have
as a nation, reached a high plane, and we
nave been rising. so rapidly of late that
r>Â°rhaps we do not set quit.' clearly at
the moment; but the glamor will soon

I am a believer in President McKinley's
policy, and I propose, as a good, patriotic
citizen, to uphold that policy. It is too
late now, it seems to me, to cavil at the
progress of events in the Philippines. It
Is dreadful to read dally in the news

good, brave American boys. How little

hostile shore. <â¢
Our California boys, who are soon to be
at home again, will tell you about this;
but we can imagine that the emotion that
will overpower them when the good ship
brings them within sight of the Golden
Gate again will be one of the thrills of
life which you and I and all of us would
give much to just once experience. Their
labors and their sacrifices will not be in
vain, for the stars and stripes are some
time going to mean more of good and hap
piness for the Filipinos than for the peo
ple who took the flag there.
The future of those islands, so far as
the United States is concerned, is a prob
lem indeed, but it is a problem the solu
tion of which will lie in the justness of
our administration of those islands What
we shall want there first will be not state
hood but a military government, with a
Civil Governorâ able, honest and kindâ
whose underlying principle of action will
be the. determination to do those things
which are right to be done in the interest
of the people.
The betterment of their physical moral
and commercial condition is the point we
want to reach, and the only men who can
help us to attain that point are the men
of honest purpose, who are willing- to
go there not for what they themselves can
get out of the country but for what thtv
can give to it. We have plenty of such
men and I am confident that our wise
President will find them. Meantime as !
I said before, I am for upholding' his
hands, and I wish him godspeed in hiÂ«

And then came General T. H Hub
bard, who talked of esoteric matters
He labored sweating^ over the details
and intricacies of Southern Pacific
business 1 and wound up with an exor
dium whose burden was that there
should be a community of interests be
tween business men and the railroad
people. Wild ap>'ause trailed General'
Hubbard's ecstatic conclusion and then
Dr. Horatio Stebbh"* took the floor. . .'
â¦A strain or two of the good old
Southern Pacific hymn, "He's a Jolly
Good Fellow," followed the general to
his chair and amid great hand exer
cise Rev. Horatio Stebbins was intro
duced. "I esteem it a great pleasure
to be in such company," the divine
said. "What we need is a communica
tion of ideas, to associate from time to
time with men whose planes of life dif
fer and whose daily thoughts diverge.
When I look up and down this board
I notice the different vocations repre
sented here and I feel a little conceit
of personal advantage as I think how
you would feel if you had to write a
sermon. My friend Fillmore would
sweat more than when he quelled the
mob in Sacramento. J. C. Stubbs would
dissolve and evanesce. 1 would give
Collis P. Huntington the text: 'The
petty king gave him a land grant; the
petty king said to him, "What road j
have you built to-day?" Let me for 1
a moment strike a nobler strain. It is
common to say that men of substance ;
are men of sense. We know as men
of sense that ". no great prosperity can
attend human effort unless capacity ,
meets with opportunity. Man creates (
nothing; merely avails himself of those I
things' already made."
A tribute .to Huntington and Hub
bard and some more sacred music by '
the orchestra and then Colonel Henry
Weinstock was allowed a few brief mo- j
ments on the post-prandial stage.
Rev. Dr. Mackenzie was called upon ,
and said: "I have heard many things
of the .railroad, but never before â¢ to
night did I hear the threat that the j
railroad thought of establishing a the
ological department." Dr. Mackenzie !
exalted in the fact that so many good
men of such various tastes should be
congregated and interchange thoughts.
With a bunch of flowers to General
Hubbard Rev. Mackenzie gave way to
Toastmaster W. H. Mills.
Commodore Watson was toasted ris
ing and the orchestra played some- j
thing patriotic, in harmony with the
toast and the man who fought for his
country in Cuban waters.
Grant Carpenter, president of the
Press Club, next, entertained the guests
by a story or two and a halcyon pic- |
ture of the newspaper man's life.
The next on the list was Rabbi Voor
sanger, .who spoke on a historical sub- !
ject, "The Close of Spanish Rule in the
Western Hemisphere." ' It was an elo
quent and stirring tribute to the man
hood of young America. With an ex
hortation to Americans to let their
trinity be equity, justice and righteous- j
ness- in their teachings to other nations j
he closed amid' great applause.
The remaining toasts were "The Sta- ]
bility of American Institutions.". 1 by
Van R. Paterson; "The Most Auspi
cious Tendency of the Time." by Rev.
Charles Edw.ard Locke, and the "Ar
tistic Development of Our State." by
Irving M. Scott.
A standing toast, mutual felicitations
and a grand -patriarchal,- beneficent
smile for his children from Uncle.him
self and the annual dinner by heads. of i
departments to the head of all became j
a matter of history.
Invitations are out for the return
banquet by Collis P. Huntington at his
residence, 1020 California street, on Sat

Professor Bacon Delivers a Strong
. Lecture on "The White Man's
. Burden."
The fourth of .the Charming Auxiliary
lectures was , delivered yesterday . after
noon in the parlors of the First Unitarian
Church by Professor Thomas R. Bacon,
of the University of California. His sub
ject was "The White Man's Burden," and
in its application he dealt with the pres-
situation in the Philippines. Professor
Bacon has given much study and thought
to the complicated question with which
this Government now has to deal, and hla
remarks were very applicable and he held
the closest- attention of his audience.
In brief Professor Bacon demonstrated
by a logical analysis the doctrine of Kip
ling as it is applicable to the present exi
gencies in the Philippines. He declared
that we have "The White Man's Burden"
already on our shoulders, and .that it is
not a question whether we want it or not.
Having it, he said that we are compelled
to govern the Philippines in the Interest,
of the inhabitants of the islands at anj^
cost. As to the kind of government that
he favored, Professor Bacon said that it
was defined most thoroughly in the
proclamation issued by General Otis.
