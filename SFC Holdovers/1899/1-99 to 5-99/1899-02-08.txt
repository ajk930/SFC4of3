General Otis finally recalled the troops,
but the natives, misunderstanding the re

outskirts of the town were burned.

The Americans, as this dis-

control of the situation within a
radius of twenty miles of Manila,
their lines extending to Malabon
on the north 'and to Paranaque
on the south and fully twenty
miles long. While . a few de
tached bodies of the enemy offer
desultory opposition, the main

Of the hordes of troops origi

The rebels, who have been
swept in every direction, like
pheasants in a batteau, die by
the hundreds in the trenches
for the most part passively, ex
cept the Ygorotes, who charge
desperately and uselessly.
The rebel prisoners declare
that their attack was unpremedi

were interred between Paco and

The converted river gunboat
did terrible execution among the
rebels, sweeping both banks of
the river with her Gatling guns
and her heavier battery. Hun
dreds of Filipinos undoubtedly
crawled into the canebrakes and
died there.
The Americans are working
nobly in their efforts to find the
wounded and are bringing hun
dreds of suffering rebels to the
hospitals for treatment. The na
tives are unable to understand
the humane motives which
prompt the victors to succor the
wounded of the enemy.

The chief of the Ygorotes, the
Filipino natives who fought so
gallantly in the face lof our artil
lery with their bows and arrows,
is in a hospital with a shattered
thigh. He admits that he never
saw modern artillery and was ig
norant of its effects until he and
his followers met the disastrous
fire of Sunday morning. The
chief is bitterly incensed against
the Tagallos for placing the Ygo
rotes in front of the American
battery, under the pretense that
they were sent to occupy the post
of honor, and he intimates that
the Ygorotes will avenge this
treachery when the survivors re
turn north.
It is regarded as a significant
fact that many of the Filipino of
ficials of this city disappeared
from Manila as soon as hostilities
commenced. Some of them are
supposed to be still hiding here.

Colonel J. F. . Smith, who is in
command of the First California
Regiment, is one of the most
popular officers now in the Phil

rigid discipline and soldierly
qualities that this popular or

a state of perfection, and under
his personal leadership Â£it has
distinguished itself time and

The Leader of the Filipinos Has Gone Too Far
on the Road to Destruction to
Draw Back.
MANILA, Feb. 7.-Aguinaldo, the rebel lead

Sunday. The proclamation of Saturday says:
"I order and command:
." FirstâThat' peace and friendly relations
with the Americans be broken and that the lat

scribed by the laws of war.

GENERAL OTIS
TO FOLLOW UP
HIS GREAT VICTORY
NEW YORK, Feb. The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: With the prosecution of a
vigorous campaign against. Aguinaldo
and his followers, and the promise of
protection to those residents of the
Philippines recognizing the sovereignty
of the United States, the administration
officials are confident that it will not be
long before pea and order are restored
in the archipelago.
General Otis is expected, under the
instructions sent to him, to follow up
his victory over the insurgents and
prevent their reorganization, and in
this work, he will be assisted by Rear
Admiral Dewey and the fleet under his
command.
At the request of General Otis the full
text of the Paris treaty was cabled to
him this afternoon, an J he was told to
proceed with his operations.
The situation in the Philippines was
the subject of earnest discussion at the
Cabinet meeting to-day. Congratula
tions were exchanged over the ratifica
tion of the treaty, and the President's
determination to conduct a vigorous
policy, toward the Insurgents met with
the approval of all of the officials.
The decision of most importance
reached was that neither General Otis
nor Admiral Dewey is in need of re
inforcements, and none will be sent to
them unless they specifically request it.
A cablegram of inquiry has been sent
to Rear Admiral Dewey as to the con
dition of the three former Spanish
gunboats being reconstructed at Hong
kong, and the suggestion has been ad
vanced to him that they be pushed to
completion.
By direction of. Captain Charles
O'Nell, chief of the Bureau of Naval
Ordnance, ammunition is being, pre
pared at Mare Island for shipment to
Manila on board the Celtic, and the
army Bureau. of Ordnance will send by
the Sheridan a quantity of ammunition
for field guns and small arms. I under
stand that' as a result of the Cabinet
meeting it is expected that General Otis
will 1 not confine his operations to the
vicinity of Manila,^ but will pursue the
insurgents and- occupy such towns as
he * may deem important. . : It ; ,was ex

Of course, there .will be no weakening

The rebel leader also refers to the
enormous losses of the Filipinos, but
says "slavery is bitter," and calls upon
them to "sacrifice all upon the altar of
honor and national integrity." He in
sists that he tried to avoid an armed
conflict, but claims all his efforts were
useless before the unmeasured pride of

It was stated to-night that until rati
fications are exchanged no complaint
could be made by this Government
against the shipment of arms, . but the
authorities stand ready to appeal to the
good will of those nations sovereign
over Asiatic territory to stop such
traffic. 'Â ;_'â â¢â â

twelve new warships are agreed to and
three more are under consideration.
The committee has followed the rec
omendations of the Secretary of the
Navy and has passed --- the first, sec
ond and fourth class of new ships rec
ommended by him. These are: Three
sea-going battleships of about 13,500
tons displacement each, carrying the
heaviest armor and most powerful

Volunteers Must Serve.
WASHINGTON, Feb. The ratifi
cation by the Senate of the peace treaty
has started talk about the probable
early muster out of the volunteers. It
is understood, however, that this ques

sides, to the inconvenience, nat
urally, of the civilians. All the
public conveniences at this writ
ing have either been impressed of
have disappeared in some manner
or other. Street car traffic, how
ever, has been resumed and the
cars are running regularly,
though the streets are almost de
serted. There are few natives
to reopen the shops, and white
. flags in the nature of towels, pil
; low slips and aprons tied to bam
boos adorn the windows of the
natives' residences everywhere.
: But in spite of these emblems of
;. peace, scores of Filipinos, under
... the cover of darkness, fired from
these same windows yesterday
evening on the American patrols.
At 9 o'clock last night there was
a general fusillade in Quiapo and
Binondo districts. The inhabi
tants of the city generally be
lieved that a battle was raging at
their doors, lights were extin
guished inside the dwellings and
a majority of the people were in
a state of terror. Under the cir
. cumstances it is remarkable that
no casualties were reported. Sev
eral shots were fired across the
â¢ : .river during the excitement.
The Americans now have the
railway line to Caloocan, and 600
marines with four Maxims have
. been landed at Fleet beach, north
of the city, near Malabon, and
â  .covering that town.
â¢. There are many indications
.-â¢-. that Manila is full of desperadoes
: who had intended to co-operate
'. with Aguinaldo. The police are
continually capturing men and
women with weapons concealed
.in their clothing. The vigilance
â¢ of the authorities in this respect
' ". is highly reassuring.
.' ". Last Saturday about midnight
two Englishmen accidentally en
countered a gang of 'armed na
tives in a dark side street. The
natives, fearing discovery, im
prisoned them until morning and
. threatened to kill them unless
. they maintained silence.
Many native clerks employed
by mercantile houses are missing.
. As it is impossible that they
should have passed the lines, the
inference is that they are hiding
in the city.
Several attempts were made to
assassinate Americans on the
street, but that danger is now at
a minimum. The natives are ter
ribly cowed and the precautions
( taken, especially against incen
. diarism, are admirable.
The American troops are be
ing promptly furnished with
supplies of all kinds. In brief,
all the wants of the troops
are met immediately by the
different military departments
whose duty it is to attend j
to such matters. Artificer Hayes '
of Company I of the Colorado
regiment discovered the missing
parts of the pumping machinery
of the water works buried in a
coal pile at Singalon station. The
machinery will soon be in work
ing order again, and the em
ployes having promised to return
to work this morning it is im
probable that the threatened
water famine will occur.
TREATY MUST BE
RATIFIED BY SPAIN
â 
Madrid Notified of Its
Adoption.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â The State
Department was advised to-day by the
White House that the United StateÃ
Senate had formally ratified the peace
treaty yesterday. Secretary Hay at
once sent a notice to that effect to M.
Thiebaut, the Charge d'Affaires of the
French Embassy here, with the request
that he communicate the fact to the
Spanish Government. This course is
necessary, as direct diplomatic inter
course has not yet been resumed be
tween the United States and Spain.
There is nothing now to do but to
await the action of the Spanish Gov
ernment. The Cortes must ratify the
treaty as did the United States Senate.
It assembles this month and it is not
believed there will be much delay. It
Is said to be Impossible under the Span
ish parliamentary procedure for the
treaty to be held under consideration
before the' Cortes for any such length
of time as it was before the United
States Senate. â ''Ââ¢â¢.*:.
According to the terms of the treaty
final ratifications must be exchanged
on or before the 10th of June, but it
is expected- they will actually be ex
changed long before that date. The
exchange must take place in Washing
ton and the Spanish Government prob
ably will send an especially empowered
Embassador for that purpose.
Some time before the ratifications are
exchanged the President must sign the I
treaty, thus formally approving the
action of the United States Senate,
something he has not done up to this
time. . *
REPATRIATION OF
SPANISH PRISONERS
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.-Nothing has
been done since last week by the War
"department in the matter of repatriat
ing the Spanish prisoners in the Philip
pines. It was expected on Thursday
that by Saturday General Otis would
supply the department the total num
ber of Spaniards to be carried home,
and that on the receipt of this informa
tion the contract would be formally
awarded to the Spanish Compania
Trans-Atlantica: On Saturday General
Otis was otherwise engaged, and the
list has not yet been received by the
Quartermaster General's office.
It is said, however/that the military
action in the Philippines probably will
not interfere with the shipment of the
Spanish prisoners to Spain,', and may
rather accelerate It, as the dispatches
from General Otis indicate a number of
refugee Spaniards ln the insurgent
ranks, and the presence of a large num
ber of prisoners of war in Manila makes
that many more mouths* to feed, be
sides diverting a large number of Gen
eral Otis' forces from an aggressive
campaign to guard the prisoners
against. an uprising.;

Aguinaldo's London Man Says
Otis Schemed to Capture the
Water Works,
LONDON, Feb. 7.â The president of the European Filipino Junta in
an interview with a representative of the Associated Press to-day said:
"It is perfectly clear that the unfortunate hostilities at Manila were oc
casioned by an attempt of the Nebraskans to find a pretext to obtain
control of , the Singalon water works. The Americans for months have
endeavored to Induce the Filipinos to withdraw from the works, as the
latter, fully recognized their immense strategic Importance. By the de
struction of the villages between the sea und the river banks, the
Americans secured a vast open space from which Manila might other
wise have been attacked under cover.
"The Americans have captured the water works and the Filipinos
will now have to retire to the mountains of San Mateo and Boze Boze,
which, as they are only an hour's distance, command the capital, and It
will be impossible to dislodge them from there.
"The whole Filipino strength will now be devoted to the protection
of the country outside of Manila, as Aguinaldo is aware that, even if he
captured the city, he could not hold it with American warships in the
bay. yy- 'y'l'/yv'.
..' "The Americans will also have to depend for their food supply, on
shipments from abroad, as the insurgents will effectually cut off the
supplies from the interior."
The Filipino agent concluded with asserting that Agoncilio, Agui
naldo's agent in America, and the junta had unceasingly advised Agui
naldo not to commence hostilities, but he added the Filipinos regarded
the landing of American reinforcements as a threat, and these added
to the proclamation of General Otis, refusing political rights to the na
tives and inaugurating a military regime, had strained native opinion to
the breaking point. , *
PUNISHMENT OF
GENERAL EAGAN
Court-Martial Sentence
Commuted.

At the Expiration of the Period He

Honors and Re
tired.
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â The Presi
dent to-day promulgated the sentence
in the case of General Charles Eagan.
The court-martial sentence ' ' was - dis
missal from the army and the President
has commuted , this to six * years sus- .
pension from duty, which covers the re
mainder of the time prior to General
Eagan's retirement on January 1, 1905.
The following is the text of the order
of the President:
The accused, after a trial by courtmar
tial composed of officers of high rank and
distinguished services, has been found
guilty of conduct unworthy an officer
holding a commission of the United States
and obnoxious in the highest degree to the
discipline and good order of the military
establishment.- Such behavior is especial
ly deserving of condemnation ln an offi
cer holding his rank in the army and
charged with the . performance of difficult
and important army administrative duties
in, a time of great public emergency and
from whom, when subjected to adverse
criticism, an unusual degree of restraint
and constant and unfailing self-control
are confidently expected. The proceed
ings finding said sentence in the case of
Brigadier General Charles P. Eagan, com
missary general of subsistence, Unitea
States army, are therefore approved.
In view, however,- of his gallant con
duct in battle upon more than one oc
casion, which merited and has received
the warm commendation of his superiors,
and of his long and honorable record of
service, extending over a period surpass
ing in duration that usually alloted to* a
generation, having regard also to the
mitigating circumstances which were de
veloped during the trial' of 'the case, and
ln \ deference to the recommendation to
clemency submitted in his behalf, the sen
tence Imposed by the court Is commuted
to suspension from rank and duty for six
years. _Â, WILLIAM McKINLEY.
It was stated by the adjutant general
that General . Eagan's suspension car
ried him to within . a few days of his
retirement: and to the age limit. He
. will be reinstated in time to retire with
the regular rank and pay provided In
such cases. The sentence of suspension,
according to legal officers of the de
partment, . does not deprive General
Eagan of any: part of his pay, but as
the * sentence reads "without rank and
duty. he loses his allowances, which
include : commutation of quarters, ra
tions and fuel and his horse allowances.
This is quite I a large financial item.
APPROPRIATION BILLS.

WASHINGTON, 1 Feb. 7.â To-day and to

. '
IT WILL BE SIMILAR *TO THE
INDIAN WARS.
America Destined to Lose Heavily in
Life and Treasure Before the
. Filipinos Are Con
quered.
There was an air of suppressed ex
citement about army headquarters
yesterday Every one, from Major
General Shafter down to the civilian
employes, was eager to hear the latest
news. As fast M fhe bu â etlng con _
taining accounts of the fltrhtinir and
casualties were â  received they, were
eagerly seized upon and read. General
Shafter, when, asked for his opinion of
the present situation at Manila, said'
As far as I am able to judge from
the press dispatches that I have read
there has been hard and severe fight
ing. To. me the situation presents but
one aspect: It is how simply a Question
of a campaign against Aguinaldo.
There is no doubt that he will have to
be utterly crushed, but at what cost of
life to our forces it is simply Impossible
to form even an estimate, for I- am not
familiar with the \ ground or the nature
of the fortifications. , In a war, this
will simply mean a new style of Indian
warfare for our troops. The loss al
ready has been . heavy and before we
are in complete possession of the
islands many more of our brave men
doubtlessly will have to meet the death
of a soldier.
s "I have received no news from Wash
ington that leads me to believe that
any more troops will be sent here for
embarkation, but. of course, I cannot
tell what the next few days may bring
forth. The War Department evidently
is awaiting developments, and while, in
my opinion, General Otis has sufficient
force with which to cope with Aguin
aldo, still future developments may
show that more troops are required,
and in that case they may be sent
from this point. Ido not believe. the
campaign would be a very long one.
but this is merely a conjecture on- my
part." '-.....'
Major R. H. Noble and Captain E. H.
Plummer, aids de camp to General
Shafter, who saw active .'service in
Cuba, discussed the situation in a clear
and logical manner. Both are of the
opinion that the present campaign may
prove to be a costly one in many ways
besides the loss of human life. It is
evident from what they have to say
that our troops will immediately begin
an aggressive campaign against Aguin
aldo s forces and this will of a neces
sity mean loss of life to our men, as the
Americans will be forced to attack for
tified positions.

Â«*-aphs: President McKlnley will re
ceive from the War Investigation Com

port of the investigation it has made
.Into the conduct of the war with Spain.
The report when made public will be
found to be unanimous and to be a con

Important particular has a change been
...made, and this is that the commission
has directly criticized the Secretary of

. The commission gives no specific il
lustrations of the Secretary's weakness,
but through its report little evidences |
of this fault of the Secretary can be
fdund, particularly in the matter of Iris
relations with Major General Miles. The
â ' . commission has determined not to dwell
.upon matters of strategy, and for this
â¢ reason has left out of the report all

BISHOP WILLIAMS
A VICTIM OF GRIP
MIDDLETOWN, Conn., Feb. Right Rev. John Williams, D.D., LL.D.,
': ' /anking Bishop of the Episcopal church in America, died at the episcopal
'â '"â . residence in this city shortly before 6 o'clock to-night, aged 81 years. His
.death was sudden and unexpected. He had been attacked by grip in a mild
form about a week ago, but no fatal result was apprehended.
7 Â". John Williams was born in Deerfield, Mass., August 30, 1817. He en
â¢ tered Harvard at the age of fourteen, and after remaining there two years
â¢ .7- joined the junior class at Washington (now Trinity) College, where he was
5' ; ' **rraduated in 1835. He studied theology with Dr. Samuel F. Jarvls, and was
ordained by Bishop Thomas C. Brownell in 1838. From 1837 till 1840 he
served as tutor in Washington College, and then he spent a year, in travel
.... * in England and France. On his return he became assistant minister of
'."â â  Christ Church, Middletown, Conn., from which he was called to the rector
! ship of St. George's Church, Schenectady, N. Y. While rector in Schenec
tady his Influence was great in his parish, among the students of Union
College, and he was nearly elected provisional Bishop of New York on the
suspension of Bishop Benjamin T. Onderdonk.
In 1848, when he was but thirty-one years old, he was chosen president
. 'â¢ . of Trinity College, and the announcement of his election was received with
great enthusiasm, while his inaugural address showed the scholarly prin
.. ciples on which he considered all. true education to be based. In connec
tion with the presidency Dr. Williams held the professorship of history
. ' and literature.
In 1851 Dr. Brownell, Bisl ip of Connecticut, having asked that, on ac
count of his .growing infirmities, an assistant bishop might be elected, the
diocesan convention chose Dr. Williams, and he was consecrated on Octo
. >er 29.
OSCAR GARDNER
BESTS SOLLY SMITH
-NEW TORK. Feb. 7.â Oscar Gardner, j
..the" "Omaha Kid," defeated Solly Smith !
.* of Los Angeles, Cal., in six rounds at j
the Lenox Athletic Club to-night. Smith i
-was unsteady. on his feet from the'
opening .round and was unusually wild. !
Some- persons thought he was under :
"the influence of some drug, but those j
.* close to his corner were unable to say !
whether this was so or not. Gardner
was sot in the best of condition, either, j
but he fought remarkably well and out- |
:- classed his opponent from the first tap ;
â¢ "of- the bell.
. .- In the sixth round Smith went down '
â  four times, and as he was going down
': the lait time Oscar sent a right smash j
: to the Jaw, which did not land until
' Smith -was on his knees. " Smith rolled
i ' over oa his back and was counted out,
while his seconds yelled "foul," and
many cf the spectators took up the cry.
The blew was on its way as Smith was
going down and it could not be held
back by Gardner, who had no intention
of fouling- Referee White ruled . that .
â¢ no foul had occurred and decided- in '
i .
I report the beef was not chemically pre-
I pared, that It was of good quality and
I that the charges of the use of chemicals
in the beef probably grew out of the
fact that four quarters of experimental
I beef were placed on board a transport
at Tampa by Mr. Powell, Inventor of
: the preserving process, which he desir
ed to test. This meat was thrown
overboard by direction of General
; Wood. No chemicals, according to the
commission, were employed in the
preparation of canned meat, but It will
be found that the meat was unfit for
use in the tropics because of climatic
conditions, which made It unappetizing
in appearance, though it was perfectly
good, except in those instances where
cans had been accidentally punctured
or imperfectly soldered, thus allowing
air to enter.
The recommendation will be made
that the inspector general's depart
ment be radically reorganized and the
report will sharply criticize General
Breckinridge for abdicating his office of
Inspector general to accept a commis
sion as major general of volunteers.
Instead of going to Santiago to witness
a battle there, the commission will
state, he ought to have been in the
United States continuing inspections;
and had they been made with more fre
quency epidemics of typhoid could have
been avoided.
The medical department will also be
criticized for lack of Inspections, as
well as failure to properly carry out
sanitary regulations. The Secretary of
War will be cleared of responsibility
for the transport horrors, but Colonel
C. F. Humphreys, now on General
Brooke's staff, who had charge of the
fitting out of transports, and officers of
the quartermaster's department in
charge of them will be held responsible.
Gardner's favor. There was very little
"kicking" over the verdict.
Two heavy-weightsâ Dick Moore of
St. Paul and George Basell of Brooklyn
âmet in a preliminary bout at catch
weights for ten rounds. For big fel
lows they put up a hard, fast fight,
which was full of hard hitting. Moore
had the better of the argument from
the second to the tenth round. In the
opening: and closing rounds. Basell had
the advantage, but at the close Moore
had so far outpointed his man that the
referee declared the St. Paul man the
winner. 7-^" Â±7.'

STAGE DRIVER'S
BRAVERY FOILS
TWO OUTLAWS
Though Seriously Wouoded FJc
Escapes With Wells
pa rgo's Treasure.
IONE, Feb. 7.â An attempt to rob the \
lone and Jackson stage at 7 o'clock this
morning, at a point about four miles
this side of Jackson and eight miles
above . this city, was frustrated
through the bravery of Driver 'Peter
Podesta. Though seriously wounded
by a volley from the bandits, who were
two ln number â the proverbial "tall
man and a short one" â he applied the
whip to his horses and dashed down a
steep grade, pursued by cold lead from \
â  the weapons of the road agents. Wells- I
i Fargo Express Messenger McConnell, j
who rode with the stage, was 'serious
ly Wounded also, but he returned the
fire of the two desperadoes and sue- j
ceeded in wounding one of them. The
highwaymen were captured late this â 
afternoon at a point a few miles from
the scene of the attempted hold-up.
The attack upon the stage was one |
of the most desperate that has ever I
! been recorded In the criminal annals of I
this county. Without giving the, driver j
an opportunity to obey a command to j
halt, the two bandits commenced to
shoot. They shot to kill, too, and Po- I
desta's escape from death was by the |
j narrowest of margins. The bandits ;
I stepped from a clump of brush and j
| opened fire as the stage was rounding j
I a curve.
Both highwaymen had shotguns, and i
' besides these one carried a revolver
j and the other man a rifle. Shells
: for the rifle found where the men
â  stood when the shots were fired show
i that the rifle failed to explode its
! shells, as the primers of the shells are
Indented from contact with the flring
' pin. After failing to use the rifle both j
i bandits used their shotguns. The driv- |
i er of the stage., Peter Podesta, was |
j shot through the right hand with two j
buckshot and his coat was literally
riddled in front where it was blown
! open by a gust of wind just as the
bandit fired. Eleven buckshot pierced |
i the driver's outer clothing, and at least j
i four of these went through his under- j
clothing and broke the skin on his
breast and abdomen. Podesta's, home
is at Jackson. He was but recently
married.
R. E. McDonnell, We..s, Fargo &
Co.'s shotgun messenger from Jack
son to Stockton, was more' seriously |
1 wounded than was the driver. McCon
i nell was struck in the left arm by five
buckshot, three . of them passing
through the forearm, being now im
bedded in the bone, which is consid
erably shattered. Another of the buck- ;
shot is lodged between the bones of the \
left forearm.
, Instead of complying with the com
mand, "Halt!" Driver Podesta ap
plied the whip to his six horses and
came down the grade at break-neck \
speed, while blood spurted, in streams
from his wounded right hand. .- ;* '
The scene of the attempted hold-up
is about 200 feet above where Black

GETS AN APOLOGY
London Mail Does the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 7.â ln the Queen's
bench division of the high court of jus
tice to-day before the Lord Chief Jus
tice of England, Baron Russell of Klllo
wen and a special jury was heard the
suit of William Waldorf Astor against
the Dally Mall of this city to recover
Â£10,000 damage for a libel which "held
him up to ridicule and contempt."
There was an imposing array of
counsel on both sides. Sir Edward
Clarke, Q. C, counsel for the plaintiff,
said the libel was published on Octo
ber 18 last, and was 'headed "Mr. As
tor's Strange Dinner Party." It de
clared, counsel continued, that as the
outcome of a wager of 5000 pounds with
General Owen Williams, Mr. Astor
brought the trunk of a California red
wood tree here and gave a dinner party
at Clivedon around it. A fictitious list
of guests, counsel said, was. published
and indeed, the whole details except
i the mere fact that Mr. Astor brought
the tree to England was an effort of
! imagination, and Mr. Astor claimed he
! was therefore held up to the public as a
1 foolish and ridiculous person.
Sir Edward Clarke said Mr. Astor
i was an American gentleman of great
; wealth, "who had made this country
his home, had a house In Carlton
House Terrace and was the owner of
the beautiful estate of Clivedon," and
that soon after he settled in England
: "certain personal and offensive para
| graphs from time to time appeared
about him." . â¢- ~ /â 'â 'â '-/ - ,
Mr Astor then took the stand and
confirmed Sir Edward Clarke's state
ments He added that many of -the
guests mentioned were -unknown to
him and he expressed the. belief that
i some of them did not exist. The mat
ter caused him great annoyance, but
he was always willing to accept an
apology. Thereupon the ":."' Lord Chief
Justice asked If it were possible for an
apology to be given at this stage of
the proceedings. The Right Honorable
Edward Carson, Q. C, ;' formerly; solici
tor general for Ireland, in behalf ' of
Alfred Charles " Harmsworth, principal
proprietor of the Dally Mail and other
papers, said his client was always
ready. and willing to apologize. ,7 *

was shot, and don't know whether any
such command was given. McConnell
tried to use his gun on the bandits, but
found that his left arm was useless, so
he rested his gun on the iron railing on
top of the stage and shot with the use
of his right arm only. I don't know
whether McConnell's shot hit either
robber or not didn't have time to look
at anything but my team."
. Messenger McConnell said: "I didn't
see or hear anything of the bandits
until the shooting -commenced. * I" was
struck in the left forearm by the first
discharge of shot. The bandits fired
two shots close together. I tried to
shoot back, but couldn't use my left
arm, then I rested my gun across the
iron railing on top of the stage and shot
at the robbers, my shot being the third
one fired. After this one robber. fired
another shot, but by that time the stage
was far past where the robbers were
left standing."
Frank Goss says the short robber fell
on his face on top of his gun when
Messenger McConnell shot. Mr. Parker,
who drove a rig down from Jackson
just behind the stage, says that only
one of the bandits started away from
the scene of the shooting.
Messenger McConnell was taken to
his home at Stockton this morning. It
is not known just how much treasure
there was aboard the stage, but the
amount is believed to have been about
$8000. The monthly shipment of bullion
from the Argonaut mine, the largest
gold producer of the county, was made
last Sunday. It has been the practice
lately to send treasure from the mines
on special days and not on regular ship
ment days. The regular days for ship
ping treasure by express from here are
Tuesdays and Fridays. Evidently the
robbers knew this and calculated that,
to-day being the first regular day after
the deposit of Argonaut bullion, they
would find the treasure in progress of
shipment to lone by express. If the
highwaymen had succeeded in captur
ing the express box they would have
been sadly disappointed in the value
of its contents. ."*?,-â¢

BRAVE McCONNELL'S STOUT.
Did the Best. He Could to Answer
Shot With Shot. ,*
v STOCKTON, Feb. 7.â Reason E. Mc-
Connell, the express messenger, who
made such a game showing when the
Jackson stage was attacked to-day, is
a resident' of this city and has been in
the employ of Wells-Fargo for twenty
five years. Mr. McConnell was brought
to the city late this afternoon from
Jackson, and as soon as he reached his
home Dr. Cross was called in to attend
his wounds. . A half-dozen buckshot
were removed from his left forearm
between the elbow and the wrist. The
front of his overcoat contained several
dozens of holes and quite a" number of
the v shot had remained in the lining of
the garment. He was in great pain
from the wounds.
Three months ago he met an acci
dent which confined him to his room
for weeks, and it was only last Suit
day that he resumed his work.
McConnell is known to every officer
in this section of the State. With him
on the front of a stage with his sawed
off shotgun robbers have' generally
given it a wide berth. They evidently
thought that he was still in Stockton
when they planned the raid to-day. It
was McConnell who "winged" Black
Bart several years ago, and by break
ing Bart's arm caused the poet-robber
to drop a cuff, which was the first clew
the officers got to his identity and
which eventually led to his identifica
tion. Mr. McConnell's statement of the
attack to-day follows:
"We left Jackson at the usual time,
about 6 o'clock. We passed Cyclone
fetation, an abandoned place, and
reached Slate Rock, where we were at
tacked, at about 7:10. I have always
been on the closest lookout for road
agents at this point, as the rocks so
near the road make a convenient point
for them to safely attack us.
"Just as our leaders passed the rock
I noticed a man raise up from behind
the rock and level a gun. He fired in
stantlyâin fact, fired as he raised up
He aimed a little too far forward and
the charge passed directly in front of
me and the scattering shot struck my
arm and' landed in the overcoat lapels
and front. At the same instant the
team lunged and started on a jump
down the grade. . One of the animals
had been In the team when Messenger
Toby was killed and led off in the run
The second fire caught Driver Podesta.
The team was moving rapidly, and
what I judged to be a second man be
gan ' shootingâ at least. I thought so
from the direction of the shot.
."We were moving rapidly and I was
at a disadvantage trying to hold on
and turn around to get a bead. This
I succeeded in doing and, resting my
gun over the uninjured, part of my arm.
I let drive. I noticed one of the men
drop. on the rock. Whether it was a
feint or not, I do not know, but he must
have been wounded. The lunging stage
was rapidly taking me out of range, so
it was impossible for me to get in an
other shot at an advantage. There
were twenty-one shot in my gun, all
buckshot.
"Podesta lost all control of the team
and in his weakened condition could
i not regain control of them, and it was
not till we reached Mountain Springs
that we regained control of them and
made an examination of our wounds.
Podesta was taken back home and
Frank Goss drove the rest of the trip."
McConnell speaks of the affair in the
most matter of fact way, and his state
ment is a corroboration* of that of the
injured driver. ! McConnell's wounds
are not. considered. dangerous, the only
fear. being from blood. poisoning. , i
' Â»>Xtv appears that late last week over
$60,000 was taken .over the' route one
day by the stage. The attack was evi
dently ill-timed by the robbers from all
points of view. V *."

WASHINGTON, Feb. For two
hours or more the ' Senate to-day had

was meaningless and Inconsequential.

follow the ratification of the treaty un

Lodge (R.). of Massachusetts followed
with a strong reply*, to- Tillman, in
which he stated clearly and directly the
conditions as _ they â¢- confronted the
United,' States in .the Philippines. â *--â¢:'
"The first thing that strikes me," said
Tillman, "in the reading of this resolu
tion, is its absolute uselessness and its
cold-blooded purposeâ simple decla
ration of purpose to buy and sell these
people of the Philippines for our own
interest."
He said that never in his legislative
experience had he heard so many
speeches against a proposition, follow
ed by so many votes in favor of the
proposition. To his mind it indicated
that certain Senators had yielded to
pressure. The ratification of the
treaty has determined the fact that in
law the Filipinos were rebels against
the United States. If they fired on
our flag they would be regarded â as
rebels. That was the way the world
saw it. However, the trouble might
terminate, the Filipinos would be re
garded as patriots who were fighting
for their liberty just as much as were
the American revolutionists. Said he:
"If any resolution is passed here we
ought to pass one bringing peace to
the Philippines, not disasters or worse
than nothing. The question now is:
Are we to take the place of Spain as
taxmasters and tyrants?
"Of course," he continued, "we can
send tens of thousands of troops to the
Philippines, and, as the Senater from
Montana (Carter) said the other day,
we can shoot those people to death; but
ought we to do It? Is it honorable for
us to do it?" H_M
Mr. Tillman then read some verses
from Kipling's latest poem, "The White
Man's Burden,", which he regarded as
exactly fitted to our case.
"Every man rin .'this, chamber but
five," said he, '/who '"has had to do .'with
the colored race, voted against the

The Colorado ' Midland has encoun
tered fresh difficulties, the wind drift

been cleared. Besides, the cold is so in
tense that men cannot endure to work
long at a time clearing the tracks.
Until the Midland is opened Its through
trains will run over the Rio Grande
tracks.
After weeks of toil the Colorado and
Southern has been forced to abandon
the effort to open the "high line" be
tween Como and Leadville. A high
wind last night filled the cuts with
snow and the rotary was returned to
Como to remain until the weather mod

It is estimated 60,000 sheep in South

"Another twenty-four hours of

Wyoming since February 1 and 50 per
cent of the cattle of Wyoming will be

"The winter is without exception the
worst that has ever been experienced in
that part of the country. There is not
a shrub or bunch of grass of any kind
visible between this city and Western
Wyoming along the. railroad and it
would be impossible for the cattle to

those people a government, whether it
be satisfactory to them or not."
* The debate on the McEnery resolution
was concluded by ' Lodge in a brief
speech, in the course of which he re
viewed the facts relating to the in
surrection in the Philippines against
Spain. Lodge explained that our forces
were .in .Manila In thorough accordance
with the laws of war. We succeeded to
the sovereignty "of Spain. We had
never by any .acts sought to oppress the
people, of those islands.
"Their oppression," said he, "has ex
isted solely in the speeches that have
been â¢ delivered in : the Senate of the
United States, but like all Orientals
they mistook kindness for timidity."
! Speaking of the restraints placed
upon the American forces in the Philip
pines Lodge said:
"The strongest orders have gone from
the President to General Otis and Ad
miral Dewey to exercise the greatest
care in their treatment of the Filipinos
and not by word or deed to provoke
them. A fortnight ago General Otis,
in accordance with orders received
from the administration, officially in
formed Aguinaldo that he had no in
tention of making an attack upon the
Filipino troops.
"What encouraged them to make the
attack Ido not . know. I; do know
that the representative of the Filipinos
here fled to Canada before the attack
was made. He knew or I believe he
knew that the attack was to be made
and believed it desirable that he should
flee. The attack was made and it was
met as American soldiers and Ameri
can sailors always meet such attacks.
While these people are in arms against
us, it is not a time for us to meet them
with promises and extraordinary pro
testations of good faith. We must
meet them in the same way that they
attack us."
Mr. Lodge concluded by reiterating
his statement that it was his belief
that the Filipinos had made a precon
certed and prearranged attack upon
our troops at Manila for the purpose
of influencing action on the treaty.
Mr. Mason of Illinois, in giving no
tice that he would use his every effort
to secure an early vote upon the reso
lution, said .that he did not consider
appropriation bills of as great impor
tance as the passage of the resolution.

BURLINGAMES
WIN AT POLO
Defeat the Men From
Riverside.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 7.â Owing to
the cold weather scarcely 800 people
witnessed the polo game to-day. The
first vehicle to arrive on the ground
was the Hobart coach and four-in
hand, Mr." Hobart himself handling the
ribbons and showing little effect of the
serious illness which has kept him until
to-day from all the gay doings since the
horse show began. Seated on the coach
were Mrs. Hobart, Mrs. W. E. Lester
and Mrs. Charles A. Baldwin.
The Burlingame team, resplendent in
bright red jackets, pale blue caps and
white breeches, was first to appear. It
was followed shortly by the Riverside
team, clad all in white. ; The Riverside
players were Robert Lee Bettner, C. E.
Maud, G. L. Waring and H. R. Mackie.
The Burlingame team was composed of
Richard and Joseph Tobin, C. Dunphy
and Charles A. Baldwin. Dr. J. A.
Edmunds, "the father of polo," acted
as umpire for Riverside and Richard
McCreery for "Blingum." The sonor
ous voice of the pool seller announced
that the odds on the game were even,
but they changed to 10 to 7 on Bur
lingame when, after the first period of
ten minutes play, the game stood 1 to 0
in favor of the northerners.
! In the first period the ball was put
out, and by a good swing of his stick a
"Blingum" sent it spinning toward the
south goal. The play was fast and
furious. The Riverside team blocked
several ball's that seemed sure to pass
goals. Toward the close of the period
the ball was sent rolling toward the
northern goal by a Burlingame player,
and the ponies strung out In a pretty
line across the field. One of the River
side player's ponies proved to be the
fleetest, and a clever backward swing
of the player's stick prevented the ball
going through the goal. At the end of
the first period the score was 1 to 0
in favor of the Burlingame team.
The Riverside team had no better
luck in the second period. When time
was called the score stood 2 to 0 ln
favor of Burlingame.
In the third period C. A. Baldwin of
Burlingame and R. L. Bettner of the
Riverside team collided violently and
were dismounted.- The crowd in the
grand stand thought the players were
injured, but their fears were soon
quieted when Umpire Edmunds an
nounced no one hurt. At the end of the
third period the score stood 3 to 0 in
favor- of the Burlingame team.
In the fourth period the Riverside
team scored a goal. When time was
called the score stood 3 to 1 in favor of
Burlingame.
The Burlingame team won by a score
of 5 to 2. --

INCIDENTS OF THE DAY AT SACRAMENTO.
DEADLOCK WILL BE
BROKEN, BURNS AND
GRANT WILL LOSE
The Mexican and the San Diegan Both Out
of the Running.
OPEN FIELD FOR CLEAN CANDIDATES
Developments of the Past Twenty-Four Hours Show That a
Break-Dp Is Near at Hand and Both the
High Men Will Be Dropped Out. ! :
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 7.â There will be
no Senatorial deadlock. The pres
ent Legislature will elect a United
States Senator to succeed the
Hon. Stephen M. White, and the man
elected will be neither D. Ms Burns nor
U. S. Grant. So much has been made
certain by the developments of the past
' twenty-four hours.
â¢ Though it has been known to others
for days and even weeks, Burns has
but Just now permitted himself to real
ize the utter hopelessness of his cause.
That he does realize it is made more
than certain by the fact that he has
confided his belief to a few of his
closest friends and supporters and has
enlisted their aid to assist him in sav
ing whatever he may from the wreck of
his misguided ambition. Two weeks
ago he might have named the Senator
had he so desired. To-day he can only
hope to gain such favor from the suc
cessful candidate as may be given him
in return for the handful of votes over
which he holds a fast-diminishing in
fluence.
The change in sentiment that has
'' brought Burns face to face with defeat
deals at the same time a death stroke
to the waning chances of the candi
date from San Diego. But Grant, un
like Burns, now boasts of having an
agreement with the political bosses of
the railroad company whereby he is to
fall heir to whatever votes the corpora
tion can command in the Legislature.
It Is no doubt true that such a contract
Is being negotiated and that the date
of transfer is fixed for the latter part
of this week. What effect this will
have on Grant's chances of success may
be inferred from the following recital
of facts:
The railroad Influence can command
and deliver to any other candidate than
Dan Burns no more than eight votes in
the Legislature. This is acknowledged
by the corporation's agents themselves,
and is well known to all familiar with
the situation here. There are at pres
ent in Grant's camp just twice that
number of legislators who now solemn
ly assert that if the Southern Pacific
Company or any of its agents seeks to
assist in the election of Grant they (the
legislators) will desert him in a body
and cast their votes for some candi
date who will be acceptable to them
and the communities which they repre
sent.
In order that he may hold his present
strength until he can wheel his prom
ised railroad supporters Into line Grant
is burning his bridges behind him and
Is resorting to all sorts of subterfuges..
To-day the Information was confided to
his supporters, confidentially, that on
Thursday or Friday Senator Stratton
and Assemblyman Knowland of Ala
meda would change their votes from
Barnes to Grant. During the past two
days, through the instrumentality of
Grant's paid agents, th two legislat
ors have been deluged with scores of
telegrams from residents of Alameda
County urging them to break the dead
lock, and suggesting that the best way
of doing so would be by voting for
Grant. In many instances these tele
grams have been followed by letters
from the senders asking the legislators
to whom they were addressed to pay no
attention to the telegrams, as they were
sent under pressure brought to bear by
men whom the writers did not wish to
antagonize.
To show how futile are these last
efforts of Grant to whip reluctant leg
islators Into line it is only necessary' to
state that both Stratton and Knowland
unqualifiedly assert that they will not
vote for Grant this week, and that they
have no good reason to believe that
they will ever vote for him. There are
few men In Sacramento to-night who
are not willing to make known their be
lief that both Grant and Burns are out
of the running, and that there Is now
an open field for the candidates who
have no blots on their escutcheons and
who are known tb be acceptable to the
people of the State. "
The suspicion is so strong that Grant
is seeking to augment his strength by
questionable overtures for a block of
votes that one man of high standing
who has been voting for the San Diego
candidate declared to-day that he
would abandon Grant's cause If the
negotiations were carried forward to
a transfer of the block. Rumors are
flying thick of a determined effort on
the part of the Grant' managers to do
the boldest kind of commercial politics
to finish the job which Green began
early last summer.
There is no disguising the 'fact, that
the Burns men are apprehensive of
danger. The cause of the sudden change
of base on the proposition to absolve
j Green from contempt may be traced to
the defiant attitude of the Grant man
agers. It was a bold move on the part
of Perkins, Pardee and Grant to go into
the heart of Alameda County and in
! vite respectable citizens of high stand
ing to send telegrams to this city re
i questing Senators Stratton and Taylor i
l and Assemblyman Knowland to vote
\ for a man who had been censured by
I the committee of investigation for cor
ruptly using money to secure the Sena
torship.
Many of the telegrams have been ex
; hibited here. In order that the people
of that county may know the citizens
who have been persuaded or beguiled
: into sending messages, The Call has |

; The Call to-night secures information
that Colonel Burns will not prolong the
; contest to the end of defeating the elec
j tion of a Republican Senator provided
; Grant goes out of the race." He mdi
' cated, however, that he would defeat
i election rather than consent to the suc
l cess of Grant. The inference that Burns
| has not parted with his political sense
| leads many to believe that there will
! be a readjustment of forces and a gen
' eral rally around some candidate who
l can defeat the San Diego statesman.
No one can tell when the break will
, come or around whom the scattered
j forces will rally. Irving M. Scott re
! appeared on the scene to-night. It is
j believed that the relations between D.
1 M. Burns and L. R. Ellert. the political
manager of Mr. Scott, are so badly
i strained that great difficulty would be
| encountered in bringing about an
| agreement to unite on Scott. When
j the break comes from Grant, as it
i must, if Burns retires, Scott may gain
i reinforcements. Inquiry to-night leads
i to the conclusion that the forces of Gen
| eral Barnes will not be weakened by
! the onslaught of telegrams from Ala
meda County. In the Bulla camp there
is the utmost confidence that Senator
Taylor will not yield to the pressure by
wire. Barnes and Bulla each expect tp
make substantial gains when the sup
porters of Burns and Grant begin to
scatter. It Is believed to-night that
Burns will be the first to move and
thus gain an advantage over Grant in
joining forces with the successful man.
.There is a deep-seated conviction that
- Perkins is ; responsible for the Grant
outburst in Alameda County. In more
than one Senatorial camp there is a
long knife out for Perkins. Burns has
; no love for him. General Barnes is not
â¢ lik#y to forget the attempt to break
â¢ his column of eleven supporters and
' Bulla is bestowing no benedictions on
| the head of the Senator.
Assemblyman Clough's resolution in-
I troduced in the session of the joint as
j sembly to-day created some surprise
and merriment. The representative
from Plumas County proposed that
| candidates for the United States Sen-
I ate should be invited to address the
I convention and provided that no speech
j should exceed one hour In the length
|of its delivery. Senator Flint, Presi
i dent pro tern, of the Senate, ruled the
; resolution out of order, but it is the
j judgment of men familiar with parlia
mentary proceedings that the ruling
was incorrect. It is not unusual for
candidates for the United States Senate
to address the Legislature when a con
test for election is pending. In sev
eral of the Eastern States the custom
ls honored in the observance.
It Is not unusual In California for
candidates for the office of Governor
to address delegates of a convention
before the balloting begins. At the cele- j
j brated Union Hall convention in San
I Francisco which nominated William Ir-
I win for Governor he addressed the dele
-1 gates, and his rivals, C. T. Ryland,
Thomas Flndlay and Philip Roach, also j
] appeared on the platform and expressed
I their sentiments. At the convention in
! San Jose, over which John Boggs pre-
I sided and' which nominated General
J Stoneman for Governor, the delegates
j were addressed by George Hearst and
; Governor. Stoneman. The speeches were
j made immediately after the candidates
! were placed in nomination and before
j the balloting began.
It is said here to-night that the joint
! assembly of the California Legislature
! might be enlightened by addresses de
j livered by U. S. Grant Jr., Daniel M.
I Burns, Irving M. Scott, â  R. N. Bulla,
I General W. H. L. Barnes and Thomas
! R. Bard. The last-named candidate is
| not here, but if desired he could come
! and | meet his fellow-citizens in Sacra
i mento. The story going the rounds to
night to the effect that General Barnes
prompted the resolution ls without
foundation in fact, f The general made
his speeches during the political cam
paign which terminated ln the triumph
ant election of Henry T. Gage for Gov
ernor, y.yv'.'.y , ''. 7' 'â ". -;-â 
The general then had all .the oppor
tunity any man could reasonably desire
to address his fellow-citizens. Every

with his views on the leading questions
of the day. Judge Clough says that the
resolution was introduced to-day on his
oitn motion .' and that he will present
the same subject to the convention to
morrow. Prrhaps an evening session
will be called and candidates invited to
address the legislators. It is acknowl
edged that in the field of oratory Gen
eral Barnes would have an advantage
over his competitors, but it is also con
ceded that Senator Bulla is a fluent and
able speaker. Irving M. Scott Is a forci
ble and earnest talker. It is called to
mind that U. S. Grant made an elo
quent speech at the great San Diego
demonstration during the late guberna
torial campaign. If the emergency de
manded another speech he could prob
ably line up with other aspirants and
make a good showing. On the subject
of calling a caucus Colonel Burns might
wax eloquent. . The sunburst of oratory
in the convention yesterday, when
Shortridge electrified the audience, Is
supposed to be a sample of Dan's stock.
No one can tell now when the agitation
for a parade of the orators will end.
The town may be filled with telegrams
before to-morrow night urging the Leg
islature to Invite the candidaes to ex
press their sentiments and break the
leadlock by the jaw-smithing process.
CAR FENDER BILL
GOES THROUGH
Upon Reconsideration the Senate
Passes the Measure.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 7.â Senator Braunhart got
his car fender bill through the Senate to
day, although it had once been beaten.
It was up for reconsideration yesterday,
but Braunhart was afraid he had not
votes enough, and in spite of efforts to
force a vote at once he had the recon
sideration postponed until to-day. He
brought It up again this morning and Its
consideration was responsible for an
hour's oratory.
Senator Leavitt rose to throw the first
stone. The bill was indefinite and of no
practical use, he said, and he saw no rea
son for Incumbering the statutes with any
such proposition. He declared that fend
ers and brakes on street cars were mat
ters for local legislation, and he did not
want to mix In municipal affairs from the
capital of the State.
Senator Simpson thought it was purely,
a matter for local legislation, and said
so for ten minutes: but Senator Smith be
lieved that as street cars were rapidly
stretching out from the cities into the
country, perhaps it would be well to
take the matter of fenders and safety de
vices out of the hands of possible venal
Boards of Supervisors and place it within
the jurisdiction of the State.
Then Senator Shortridge drew his knife.
He thought such legislation was not prop
er for Senators to dally with. He thought
the Senate should beware of all such bills,
and all such legislation. He wanted cor
Polly Works Continues to Act as "Carrier" Parrot for Milt Green
poratlons to pay a dividend now and then,
and anyway he set the Shortridge seal of
disapproval on the bill and every one like
it, and any one who would Introduce it
i or vote for it or speak or support It or be
in any way connected wlth.it. Senator Da-
I vis objected to such talk and so did
i Braunhart, who said . he would reply to
Mr. Shortridge as a question of personal
privilege afterward. :'...:
. On roll call the bill was passed by a vote
of 23 to 12. The bill applies particularly
to San Francisco, where fender legisla
tion has been pending before the various
Boards of Supervisors for years. The bill
is as follows: /'.-â *â 'â â¢ 7 â â â¢"*';. â'..'/ '
.-. An act to promote > the safety of â â ' employes
and passengers upon street railroads, by com

The people of the State of California, repre
sented, in Senate and Assembly, do enact as
follows: *â â¢'â¢ V

NO CHANGE
IN THE VOTE.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAC
RAMENTO, Feb. 7.â Colonel "Jim"
Smith, who, with a thousand and
odd Native Sons, is just now win
ning glory for this State in Ma
nila, was the choice of the
Democratic minority to-day when
it came to vote for a Senator
from California. He polled almost
the full Democratic strength, and
the mention of his name brought
cheers from every throat in the As
sembly chamber, whether Repub
lican or otherwise.
The vote was not changed. The
Impassioned and palpably inspired
speech given off yesterday by Sen
ator Charles M. Shortridge created
no defection, neither was it repeat
ed, as the more nervous feared it
would be. Assemblyman Clough
broke in on the usual order by in
troducing a resolution which pro
vided that on February 8 every
candidate who up to that time had
received a vote for United States
Senator should be. invited to speak
for not exceeding one hour. It was
very evident that Judge Clough
was trying to make capital for
General Barnes, and President
Flint of the Senate, who is zealous
ly guarding the two votes of
Thomas R. Bard of Ventura, ruled
his resolution out of order.
The result of the one ballot taken
was as follows:

I MENTO, Feb. 7.â Nearly the whole of the
I day's session of the Assembly was given
over to the discussion of the case of Mil

! ager. File and other routine work was
given the go-by, in fact there is a general
tendency noticeable this week to slight
all routine work, as night sessions are to
begin next week and night sessions are
generally given over to the general work
of the Legislature.
There was time enough, however, to pay
: off another bunch of employes.

SHERIFFS ARE HAPPY
OVER BRAUNHART'S BEAT
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 7.â The Sheriffs, and there
are many of them gathered here in Sac
ramento, are jubilant to-night, for Sena
tor Braunhart's bill to take from them a
good slice of their fees has failed to pass
the Senate. It came up for second read
ing this afternoon and was refused a sec
ond reading and engrossment. It was
snowed under, in fact, at a time in its
progress toward Its final passage when
bills are seldom molested, but Senator
Braunhart is not discouraged and says a
peat now and- then does not mean that
the end has come for any legislative
measure. .-...:',-.
Senator Cutter was the one who start
ed the trouble. When the bill was called
j for its second reading he demanded a
I rollcall, saying he did not think the bill
i was worthy of consideration and the fight
l might just as well be fought out before
it had gone any further as to wait until
the bill came up for final passage.
'* Senator Rowell of Fresno rose to speak
for the bill and to offer explanations why
it should pass and also an amendment to
it. He declared that now the unfortunates
sent to Insane asylums were taken there
by a Deputy Sheriff who knew nothing
of the handling of the insane. He said
that under the present system the trans
portation of insane persons cost the State
$10,000 a year, but should the bill become
a law $5000 would cover the cost.
Then Curtin, Morehouse, Boyce and
Leavitt all drew their' hammers and for
half an hour the Senate chamber resound
ed. Boyce was particularly bitter about
it. He wanted to know if that was the
same bill that was before the Senate two
years ago. He was informed that it was,
and he got a fresh grip and redoubled
his efforts.
Boyce said he thought the bill was a
vicious measure and had always thought
so. He believed a local Sheriff was the
man to look out for an insane person, for
the Sheriff took the patient to the asylum
immediately upon the conviction and or
der of commitment, and the unfortunate
should not be compelled to wait until the
asylum had been communicated with and
an attendant had been sent.
Senator Doty was another who came to
the rescue of the child of Mr. Braunhart's
fancy, but he did so because he said
whenever he saw a lot of men in organ
ized opposition to a measure he thought
it a good thing and he would vote for itâ
and he did.
The question came up on Mr. Rowell's
amendment. It was one to provide for a
relative to accompany or take charge of
the patient, and Cutter declared it should
be voted down, as otherwise the bill
would have to go to the printer again
and he wanted to finish it at once. He de
clared It was only a matter of transfer
ring the fees from one deputy to another
and he thought they were good enough
where they were. Senator Braunhart
made a last plea for his measure. He de
clared that when a man worked in the
interest of humanity he was always sub
jected to abuse, and then he sharply com
mented upon the presence of such a num
ber of Sheriffs. "V'y.v.
The first amendment was beaten. So
was the second and the third and the
fourth, and fifth, and then the bill Itself
was laid to rest by a vote of 25 to 7.
CARTOON MEASURE NOW
WORRIES THE SENATORS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. The bill for the pro
tection of unlovely features, young Mr.
Works' measure for the suppression of
cartoons, caused something of an argu
ment before the Judiciary Committee of
the Senate this evening. It was earnestly
advocated by Senator Morehouse, who,
next to killing editors, finds most sport in
starving artists. Senator Ashe favored it,
too, .because, he said, he wanted to hear
it discussed upon the floor of the Senate.
Senator Curtin, however, would have
made a newspaper man had he not turned
his thoughts Senateward. He thought
there was no harm in publishing a por
trait of a public man as well as a man
convicted of crime, but his journalistic
tendencies were not strong enough to car
ry him further. All the committeemen
were loth to stop the pictorial end of the
newspapers, but they felt that legislative
dignity * was best held while unaccom
panied *by any views of the legislators
and so they haggled over the trade of the
illustrator and just how he should ply it.
There was some time spent in trying to
limit pictures to simple portraits, but
cartoons had their advocates, and after
all it was decided to pass the considera
tion of the bill for another day.
Code Commissioner Shanahan came In
to plead for Braunhart's bill establishing
an income tax. The bill he wanted passed
provided for a tax on incomes over $2000
a year. This was raised by the committee
to a net income of $4000. Then, too. there
was a graduated scale of taxation, but
queerly enough it was a back-action one.
While the man with a $4000 income was
required to pay a tax of 1 per cent the
man blessed with an income of $8000 was
twice blessed with a small tax of one
half of 1 per cent. The bill caused a great
deal of discussion and was finally referred
back to the Senate with the recommenda
tion that it do pass.
i Senator Luchsinger's bill to provide a
State Board of Charities and Corrections
brought Charles A. Cushing and Osgood
Putnam before the committee to explain
and support. Mr. Cushing showed the
enormous increase In the appropriation
necessary to support the ' ever-growing
number of orphans demanding State aid
and he pointed out the lax system which
allowed so many not entitled to the priv
ilege to get in under the State's financial
wing. He pointed- out how the board of
charities provided for in the bill" would
practically remedy the. evils .in the sys
tem and his bill was recommended for
passage. . -.* '.-'-'. _'Â'_â¢ ..
Senator Taylor's amendment to the
constitution cutting down the number of
trial jurors to nine and making less than
a unanimous vote sufficient to convict
was referred to the Senate with the rec
ommendation that it do not pass.
TO HELP BOHEMIA
' HOLD ITS REVELS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 7.â A bit of legislation for
the Bohemian Club of San Francisco, and
for * similar organizations, passed the
Seriate . this morning in the shape of a
bill by Ashe, to amend the Civil Code so
as to allow benevolent corporations to
hold timber land to the extent of 160
ft ores i
Section 595 of the Civil Code outlines the
limitations of benevolent corporations,
among them being a clause prohibiting
such organizations from holding any land
except such as is necessary for their use.
The Bohemian Club -has for years been
in the habit of seeking the depths of the
forest, there to hold revels and bury care.
The first forest meeting was held near
Cazadero, but after a year or so they had
to move near Guernevllle. Then the lum
bermen, minding . neither revel nor care,
came with their axes. (The club could not
buy under the : law, but could lease; the
lumbermen would not lease, but would
sell, and so the club had to move again.
Senator Ashe's bill allows such organiza
tions as the Bohemian Club to hold 160
acres of timber land to be used only for
the purposes of the organization. Should
the* bill become a law the club may buy
a forest - home as deep in the redwoods
as it pleases.

as ascertained in the United States census of 1890 shall be the basis of
population upon which such rates are fixed in the cities and places of
this State; but when the rates have been fixed under the provision of
this act they shall not be thereafter increased by reason of a decrease
ln population In any city or place in this State, provided that if the rates
now charged In any town, city or city and county are less than those

tions. In order to Identify subscribers a card or certificate shall be
Issued to each and upon presentation of this card at any pay station
the holder shall be entitled to the free use of the telephone.
If the scale of prices fixed by the proposed law are deemed by any
telephone company to be too low such company may, within sixty days
after the act becomes a law, set forth the facts before the commission
which is empowered to inquire into the facts and to afford relief by
fixing a rate that will pay the company a return of 7 per cent on the
actual capital Invested. 7
The section creating the commission is as follows:
"Section 4. The Attorney General, the Secretary of State , and the
State Controller are hereby constituted a telephone commission, and
within thirty days after the passage of this act shall meet for the pur
pose of carrying into effect the provisions of this act at the State Capi

In each month."
The bill will be Introduced in the Assembly to-morrow in order to
expedite its passage.
TUOLUMNE CITIZENS

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. â¢ 7.â A., .voice of protest
against the maintaining of. a National
Park around the Yosemite Valley comes
from the residents of Tuolumne County,
and has crystallized In a joint resolution
introduced in the Senate this afternoon by
Senator Curtin of Sonora.
Mr. Curtin's resolution Instructs the
California delegation in Congress to fa
vor or introduce legislation to reduce the
size of Yosemite National Park and to
repeal some of the stringent laws which
now govern it. Within the confines of the
nark at present are over 59,000 acres of
land to which there are valid titles held
by men who cannot use the land. They
cannot drive cattle upon their property
within the park, and grazing Is the prin
cipal industry there, and they cannot
keep their cattle on their property even
should they be able to get them there,
for the troops which guard the park dur
ing the spring, summer and fall would
drive out the cattle, arrest the owner and.
destroy his houses and his barns. The
i law against allowing cattle to graze with
in the park is supposed to be a protecti_rt

do not hurt a forest, and anyway they say
that out of the 1500 square miles of the
park there is but a comparatively small
proportion which is covered with forests.

DENOUNCED FOR ITS
VENALITY IN OFFICE
Charges of The Call Sustained by the
Senate Committee.
SCATHING COMMENT IN THE REPORT
Gross Frauds Perpetrated Upon the State in the Con
struction of the 'Ferry Depotâ Extravagance
and Maladministration.
The Board of State Harbor Commis
. eloners has been made the object of !
. .most scathing official condemnation for j
Its conduct of water front affairs in this
city, and particularly for the frauds |
and gross impositions permitted in the j
construction of the Union ferry depot, j
' The committee appointed by the State
Senate in 1597 to investigate all State
institutions has finished and submitted
â¢ its report, which is now at the disposal
of the Senate for whatever action it
cares to take. Among the institutions
that were investigated was the Board
of State Harbor Commissioners.
The inquiry was impartial and ex
haustive. The committee, which was
composed of State Senators John H.
Dickinson, John J. Boyce, E. W. Chap
man, W. F. Prisk and C. M. Simpson,
went thoroughly into an examination of
the charges made against the Harbor i
Commission by The Call, and in every
particular justified this paper in its ac
cusations. The committee of investiga
tion declares that the Harbor Commis
sion . has entirely ignored the law
whenever it pleased to do so, violating j
the confidence placed in it by the peo
ple, employing useless officers, giving
. double salaries to favored employes, j
maintaining worthless departments at ]
â¢great extravagance, blocking necessary
â  improvements on the water front, and
submitting the State to a criminal loss
of many thousands of dollars in the
construction of the ferry depot.
â â¢ â¢ These serious allegations were made
by The Call before the committee of ;
investigation was appointed. The of
ficial inquiry more than justified the
original charges. The Senate commit
tee expresses chagrin that the money
â¢ lost to the State cannot be recovered
nor can the men that violated their
.public obligations be punished. In
connection with this official denuncia
tion of the Harbor Commission it
â¢ should not be forgotten that Commis
sioner Colnon, ex-Commissioners Cole
Vain! Chadbourne are the officers against
â¢whom the Senate committee renders its
' report. Commissioners Harney and
' .Herold are held blameless for the
, abuses that are exposed and con
â¢' demned.
;â¢ A great part of the official inquiry
â¢"was devoted to the Union Ferry Depot,
â¢ :in which the masonry, carpentering,
â â â  plastering, roofing, glazing and sky
lights were thoroughly investigated.
The committee found that the com
â  missioners made changes in the plans
â¢'and specifications of the ferry depot
'when and how they pleased. These
'.' changes, the report declares, represent
â .an actual loss to the State of a sum
.:.- between $40,000 and $75,000. The law
" was entirely ignored for two years
when the convenience of the Commis
sioners dictated a violation of their
. duties.
â¢ The original cost of the ferry depot
j .was increased by the enormous sum of
â  $350,000, and in consequence work that
was absolutely necessary on the sea
â¢wall was blocked. The committee
found that the Commissioners drew
upon the harbor improvement fund to
' build the foundation for the depot and
thus absorbed money that should
otherwise have been expended. These
in outline are the conclusions of the in
vestigating committee in reference to
the frauds perpetrated in the construe
â " tion of the ferry depot.
These conclusions are nractlcally the
< results of the expose made by The Call
. last March. It was then demonstrated
in this paper that the grossest frauds
â¢ had been committed in the construction
of the depot. The State had been
' cheated by the Commisisoners, who
â¢submitted the original plans of the
depot to constant revision and in each
revision substituted inferior work and
material for better, and with each sub
stitution increased the cost.
The floors, walls, doors, masonry,
steam heating and- plumbing of the
building were interfered with to the
detriment of the depot and the profit of
the contractors and their allies. Job
bery was evident on all sides and so
clear was the demonstration of the fact
â¢ by the expose of The Call that the local
â¢ Grand Jury took up the matter. Per
. sonal influences prevented an honest
'â Inquiry, however, and no substantial
!â¢â¢ result followed the inquisition. Noth
'â¢â¢ing practical was done until the com
;.'mittee, whose report Is now on file, be
; gan its investigations.
This committee found much more to
'. criticize and condemn in the adminls
â¢â¢â tration of Colnon and his associates
than the ferry depot frauds. The com
; niittee of the Senate also finds that the
<i .Harbor Commission is maintaining at
;-j an expense to the State between, fifty
-!.;.nn<i seventy useless employes who have
: - nothing to do, and do it remarkably
.â¢well. Three of these employes, the re
â â¢!. -port declares; receive double salaries.
!. -A deputy superintendent of repairs is
â¢â¢' employed for no other purpose than dil
igently to draw his salary. A purchas
â¢. inpr department is maintained at an an
nual expense of $9000. and the total
â¢ purchases Is only $22,000. Useless po
lice officers are on the pay roll, and the
committee recommends a general
. scheme of reform.
â  The report which makes so many
" pcathiru? comments on Colnon and his
: -.'associates is in full as follows:
y' -Your committee made as exhaustive an
examination of the affairs of the Board of
â¢ 'State Harbor Commissioners in San Fran
â¢â â¢ Hsco as time and means would permit.
- The labor of making such an examina
tion, and of hiring together any data
"that could be relied upon and would
throw Hpht upon the subject under in- j
vestigation, is very great. It involved |
the examination by experts of the original
plans, specifications, working drawings,
' -nnd everything in connection with the
â building or superstructure of the new fer
' rv depot at San Francisco. For thir pur
pose Mr. Reid of Reid Bros., and Mr.
- Favllle of the firm of Bliss * Faville, all
â¢ of San Francisco, two expert architects |
' .of repute. were employed, and it took them
something over three months to examine
' the above matters referring to the four
â  principal contracts in connection with the
: building of said superstructure viz.: ma
â¢ pnnry carpentering, plastering, roofing, ,
. jOtviiphts and glazing.
ft was the original estimate that the ]
total cost of the Union Ferry Depot at t
San Francisco would be not to exceed
. 1400,000. By an act of the Legislature the
question was submitted to the people as
to whether bonds should be Issued for j
that amount in order that the building j
! might be constructed rapidly, and at the <
same time the funds of the Harbor Com
mission might not be impaired for the
; purpose of extending the seawall, a mat
i ter of the most vital importance to the
i city of San Francisco and also to the
State and its commercial interests. The
bonds were voted and about $7000 premium
added to the original "$600,000 became avail
| able for the purpose of building this de- .
pot. This fund constituted what is known
!as Depot Sinking Fund. About this time
it was discovered that the foundation was
; not a part of the depot, so far as matters '
of construction were concerned, and that
; the foundation could be built and paid for
nut of the Harbor Improvement Fund,
I which fund is supplied entirely from re
ceipts of the commission for dockage,
1 wharfage, tolls, rents, etc. As a
: result, the sum of $349,000, in round num-
I bers, was expended out of the Harbor
: Improvement Fund for the construction of
the foundation.
â¢ The original contracts for the building
of the superstructure were let for the ag
gregated sum of $545,000 and work was I
commenced. As time progressed, revised
plans, as they are called, were formu
lated, which plans did not seem to have
changed anything in particular except as i
to the positions of partitions and con
veniences, it was tne custom of tlie '
board when any changes were made to :
get a proposal from the contractor en
gaged in doing the original work, showing i
; in some Instances deduction from his orig- !
inal contract by reason of the proposed '
< changes and additions by reason, also, !
;of the proposed changes.' As a result of i
l this system there has been expended in
addition to the original contract price of
$-45,000. on this superstructure up to the
present time. $145,000, and about $90,000
more than was realized from the bonds,
| and from the careful examination made
jby your committee's experts, and other
testimony, backed by figures which were
' sent to all parties concerned, and who
were given every opportunity they desired
to combat the figures, your committee is
forced to the conclusion, and considers
that it is abundantly supported by the
evidence taken, that the State suffered an
actual loss by reason of these changes
of from $40,000 to $75,000, and the contem
plated work is not yet completed. We
leave this wide margin because the com
mittee did not consider it its duty to trace
these figures down to a mathematical cer
tainty, and we could not see how any re
covery can be had or anybody punished
in the premises; and to illustrate what
is practically meant by this last remark
we beg leave to call your attention to the
condensation of the reports of Messrs.
Held and Faville. whicn will be found
attached hereto. This commission seems
' to have entirely, during the last years,
ignored the law where it suited their con
venience to do so. While they perhaps
were correct in determining that they
could spend the money which they did in
the building of the depot, and thus in
crease its cost so far as the puolie were
acquainted with the facts, to the extent of
about $350,000, yet, considering the neces
sity for the extension of the seawall
and the great advantage to the commer- j
cial interests of the city and State in
that work being done, and considering ;
that when the $600,000 in bonds were voted
for it was supposed that that was to
cover the cost of the entire building, and
the further fact that as a result of the
determination to build this foundation out
of the harbor improvement fund, work on
the seawall has been absolutely blocked
and nothing done since 1592, it seems
rather a violation of that confidence which
the people have placed- in their officers,
that this action should have been taken
without a more serious consideration, and
the taking of the people into their confi-
I dence by the board.
| And the board, in the judgment of your
' committee, has from fifty to seventy ab
solutely useless employes. There are at
the present time 223 upon Its rolls. In
three instances that we discovered the
employe Is carried in two capacities and
draws two salaries. There is, for instance,
since the new depot has been constructed,
a superintendent of the depot building.
The law places the superintendency of
that building in the Chief Wharfinger, and
there is no occasion whatever for a su
perintendent of the building except to
give some one a place.
The engineer who is charged by the law
with superintending all construction has
also been practically ignored in the execu
tion of the work. - . -
There is a deputy superintendent of re
pairs, whom the president of the board
said, in response to the question as to
what his duties were, that he. the presi
dent, did not know that he had any. And
it is a fair inference, from the testimony
taken that he had none, except to reg
ularly and diligently draw his salary.
There is also a purchasing department
established by the board, consisting of a
clerk and an assistant. The expense of
! maintaining this department amounts
under the present system to $9000 per
year. The amount of supplies purchased
through this department, outside of the
lumber and- piling and coal, In the pur
chase of which there is no occasion for
any purchasing department or agent,
amount, in round numbers, to the sum of
$22,000 It Is submitted that this expense is
out of all proportion, and your committee
is of the opinion that the maintenance and
operation of such department is absolute
ly useless and unnecessary, - aside from
the tremendous expense in proportion to
the results accomplished.
There is no occasion for the employment ,
of any police force by the Harbor Com
mission in the city of San Francisco. It
Is the duty of the city and of its Police
Department to take care of all property
within the- city. There is no authority
of law and no necessity, so far as your
committee can learn, for the maintenance
of any such force.
Watchmen are maintained upon the
wharves, which is an unnecessary ex
pense. The claim was made that because
the State does not insure Its property It
becomes necessary to employ watchmen
to guard It. .our committee is or the
opinion that there Is nothing substantial
in this claim. On all of the wharves oc
cupied to any great extent by transporta
tion companies, they themselves keep a
watchman for the protection of their own '
property, and certainly the State has no!
occasion to keep one itself under such I
circumstances, and there is no occasion J
for the employment of these watchmen '
that your committee is advised of
The Belt road Is operated at a loss, and I
has always been, and It seems that the
commission should have devised some
means by which it should be, at least,
self-supporting, or else should abandon
Its operation. The pay roll of this com
mission has constantly Increased year by
year during the past eight years, and par
ticularly during the past four years,
while the receipts have been considerably
less than in, former years; and no reason I
. Is apparent as a result of our Investiga
tion for this increase. It is but fair to |
; say of two of the Commissioners, that Mr.
Harney, who took office in 1897. came in
; after all of the depot contracts and
changes therein had been made, therefore '
I cannot be charged with any negligence In
i that connection. . Mr. Herold. who took '

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. Not Milton Green, but
his communication, came into the Assem
bly, chamber this morning to answer to
the charge of contempt that has kept
Ulysses S. Grant's unique political man
ager close In the seclusion of his bed
chamber these past two weeks.
As a matter of course, the usual certifi
cate bearing tidings of Mr. Green's ill
health came to hand to explain his non
appearance and pave the way for his most
remarkable signed statement. It was duly
attested by Dr. Hatch, as have been the
bulletins that have preceded it. and was
read in the usual manner from the Clerk's
desk and attracted little more than ordi
nary Interest, although from the moment
it was announced it became patent to
those who have been close in this late pro
cess of purification that it was the signal
of Mr. Grant's new "steering committee"
to begin the fight for Green's release.
Young Mr. Crowder and Lie younger Mr.
Works, of San Diego, It was very evident,
were detailed to manage the assault which
developed before an hour had passed Into
a farce as characteristically weak and
impotent as the many that Mr. Grant's
laughable course here has precipitated.
That there was an absolute lack of uni
ty and organization in the San Dlegan's
ranks was painfully evident, and that
those who did stand in to flim-flam the
rest of the House into allowing Milton
Green to tweak Its political nose unpun-
Ished, and 'flout with Impunity his disre
gard for legislative dignity in . the faces
of every one ; present, nad the combined
forces of Burns. Barnes, Bulla and -Mr.'
Grant's "little lightning rod" men lined
up solidly against them.
Particularly did this- opposition to Mr.
Green's â¢ release become noticeable .- . after
young Mr. -Works of . San Diego-had of
fered and had i read ; Mr. Green's signed
statement A good deal of sympathy has
?one out to Mr. Green these last few days
rom the; members on- the. floor and for
one reason and another there has: been a
growing tendency to give him just a shade
the best ;of It when ; the inevitable climax
should come and that same sympathy, the
reason for .it still ; operating, might . have
availed him much to-day had he not for
still another time written himself an ass
over his own signature. < â¢
Instead of confining himself to regrets
and excuses that he had not been of suf
ficient health to meet- the charges against
him he with the boldest of pens throws
defiance at his inquisitors, reiterates his
refusal to answer questions put to him,
Impudently "waives his right to appear
before the House to answer questions''
and then bases his reasons upon a claim
to an exquisite honor, the obscure points
of which found no appreciation among
the members on the floor. ' Even such
stanch Grant supporters as Radcliff.
Carglll and Greenwell were so humiliated
at the utter foolhardiness of his commu
nication that they took no stand and cast
no vote when the Grant force was called
upon to respond.
Only the efforts of Valentine and Bel
shaw, Jllson and Dibble and Kelley of
Oakland, all men of contrary affiliations
who acted out of pure charity, saved him
from being dragged from his sick bed and
thrown into a cell in Sacramento's county
jail in response to a resolution offered by
Assemblyman Brown of San Mateo.
Mr. Green's communication needs no
foot notes in its explanation. It speaks
rather loudly for Itself and reads as fol
lows:
To the Assembly of the State of California:
I have thought it proper to address you in
writing on the subject of my refusal to answer
certain questions propounded by your special
i investigating committee, Inasmuch as the con
dition of my health admonishes me that I
may not be able to appear in person at the
bar of the Assembly in the near future.
I realize that your honorable body has await
ed' a time with patience in my case, and I
assure you that it has been a matter of regret
that - _ have been compelled to ask your In
dulgence ln this behalf. .
I testified before the committee and here
repeat that I never at any time or place paid
any money or other consideration, or offered
or promised to pay any money or other con
sideration to any person as an inducement tor
a vote for United States Senator.
I deny that any contributions were contin
gent upon the promise or implied promise that
the candidates should support any one tor
Senator. On the contrary, in most of the
cases the contributions were made through
some Individual members of the State, joint
legislative or county committees, but chief
ly through prominent and active members of
the party. In no instance was there an at
tempt or offer made by me to corrupt a candi
date or exact a promise from him ln return for
any assistance from me. â  â 
The committee so found in their report, and
have also found that any moneys expended by
me were legitimately expended and your honor
able body has adopted this report. â¢â 'â '.-
To answer these questions, which I failed to
answer before the â¢ committee, would ln no
Instance show improper, illegitimate or cor
rupt use of money, nor could such answers, If
made, change in the least the findings already
Included in the committee's report and adopted
by the Assembly. To answer the questions
propounded to me would be to divulge con
fidential communications, and would serve no
useful purpose...
It is solely a question of honor with me. I
have faith in the rectitude of my Intention
and absolute confidence that answering these
questions would in no way change the report
of your committee or the action of .the As
sembly.
I mean no disrespect to your committee or to
the Assemblyâ Just this explanation will con
vince your honorable body of that factâ and
hereby waive my right to be personally pres
ent, and now submit the matter to your
Judgment. MILTON J. GREEN.
No sooner had It been read than
Crowder of San Diego offered a resolu
tion calling* for the dismissal of the
charges against Green and the discharge
of the Investigation committee. Mr.
Crowder made no statement explanatory
of his resolution, nor did he urge any
reason for its adoption. He merely con
signed it to the House and the fight, such
as It' was, was begun.
- Mr. 'Crowder"s resolution was divided in
two sections. One had to do with Mr.
Green, the other with the committee, and
It: was immediately made the center of
attack by Assemblymen Burnett, Cosper,
Dibble and Valentine.
Works and Crowder were supported
throughout the argument by Mr. Grant,
who was there In person and chewed gum,
and Walter Bacon, who has been Mr.
Grant's attorney since Green's Indisposi
tion. . ' â¢â '/â¢
Speaker Anderson put the resolution
duly before the House, and Mr. Burnett
took the floor to say:
"Mr. Green assures us that his use of
Mr. Grant's money was legitimate. He
says the report of the committee states
that he used Grant's money legitimately,
but I deny that the report of the com
mittee states any such thing. It Is not
for Mr. Green to say he used the money
legitimately: It is not for this House to
say. We nave looked Into the affairs
of some members of the House who.ac
cepted money, but there were others men
tioned we have not Investigated, and as
a matter of simple justice It Is our duty
to not stop now. I, for one, will enter
into no. such disgraceful compromise with
Milton Green. '
"It Is not better than felony for a Sena
torial candidate to put his money be
hind a candidate for the Legislature, and
no one need tell me that there Is not an
implied promise to vote when it is done."
Mr. Burnett finished and Mr. Grant,
who still chewed gum, smiled flatly and
continued to watch the game like a can
didate for poundmaster watching a bal
lot count by a lot of Incompetent election
officers. * . '*.
Assemblyman, Cosper said that there
were two elements in the resolutionâ one
Green, the other the committee; and he
thought the two points should be taken
up separately and that the committee
should.be disposed of first.
Dibble of San Francisco disagreed with
him on the question of precedence. ' Mr.
Dibble thought Green should be disposed
of first and said 50. .. The truth of the
matter was that Cosper wanted the com
mittee discharged, no matter what the
cost; but Dibble wanted it to ' go right
on grinding out good Senatorial . coin for
Dan M. Burns. He was backed ln a mea
sure by Melick of Pasadena, who wanted
Green punished for his contempt, and said
that the work of the committee was not
nearly finished if the charge was dis
missed.
"He speaks of his honor," said Melick,
"and says he would break a confidence
were he to answer these questions. If
he has made charges against any one it
is against this House, and when it asks
these "questions it releases him from se
crecy. He ought be made to answer."
During a pause at this point, Mr. Jilson
saw a chance to say a word, and he did
so iri a manner most satisfactory to every
one save Mr. Grant. His financial rela
tions with Green he gave up to, the whole
House. Green got a bit the worst of It.
Mr. Jilson said: "Through all this In
vestigation I have stood as meek and
lowly as the lowly Jesus. ;â  y I have borne
my cross without a word. v.. If Mr. Green
has 'tried to 'crucify one man more than
another that man was myself. I believe
he went to The Call and told Mr. Leake
that he had given me money. But he
did. not tell > how It had been spent nor
how I had got it. ..â¢- -:; â '.- â  *

Francisco he assured me Mr. Grant would
be elected on the second ballot. When I
saw that Mr. Grant did not get the vote
Mr. Green claimed for him I did not think
he could be elected and decided to change.
Mr. Green came to me with a contract
which he wanted me to sign, but I re
fused, as it pledged me to vote for U. S.
Grant. He said others had signed it who
had had help from him, but n > man can
ever get me to sign a contract for my
vote." â 
Mr. Dibble then demanded a division of
the resolution and after some debate It
was ordered by Speaker Anderson. Val
entine denied the question and appealed
from the decision of the chair, but was
overruled. He took It good-naturedly and
said he hoped no member of the House
had so lost his self-respect as to vote
for Green's release. .
Young Mr. Works came" to the front at
this point. Even he could see that things
were going sadly against him and he tried
to stem the tide. Said he: "Mr. Speaker.
Mr. Green waved his . right to answer
these questions In his communication this
morning." - '.<, â¢; " '-â  â 
"Very kind of Mr. Green, retorted Val
entine, "but this House has not waived
its right to have Mr. Green here."
A rollcall was finally demanded and by
a vote of 47 to 18 the House decided to not
release Mr. Green from the charges
against him.
Brown of San Mateo then offered the
following resolution: ;'.-*;- ,;;;i â¢
Resolved. That Milton J. Green, having re
fused to appear before the Assembly, pursuant
to the order heretofore made requiring him to
show cause why he should - not answer certain
questions, propounded to him -by a committee
and having failed to show sufficient cause in
his statement presented to this Assembly why
he should not answer 'said questions, be, and
he is, therefore : considered in contempt of said
Assembly because of said failure. :
Resolved, That said Milton J. Green having
answered in his statement this day submitted
to the Assembly that he is not ready to ap
pear before . said committee and make â  answer
to said questions as aforesaid, that said wit
ness. Milton; J. Green, be taken into custody
by the sergeant at arms of the Assembly for
the continuance of said contempt and that such
custody shall continue until said witness shall
communicate to this Assembly that he is ready
to appear : and make answer, and that In exe
cuting this order the sergeant at arms shall
cause the said Green to be kept in his custody,
in the common jail of the county of Sacra
mento.." 1., - ) â¢ 'y'y,y
â  Then the Burns, the Bulla and the
Barnes people stepped in to save Mr.
Grant's manager from a humiliation that
the San Diego forces were alone unable
to fight against. It was done out of pure
kindness of heart and must have pointed
a lesson to that son of his father who sat
in the lobby chewing gum. â¢
3 Honest Owen Wade of Napa protested
against the jail for a ; sick man, no mat
ter who or what he was. Mr. Valentine
protested and so did- Judge Dibble and
Assemblyman. Kelly of. Oakland, and
finally Valentine settled it by moving that
the whole second section of the resolution
go over to Friday, and it was so ordered. '
Mr. Kelly offered a resolution directing
the Speaker to appoint a select committee
of three reputable physicians and three
members of the Assembly to call upon Mr.
Green and see if he shall be ready to ap
pear upon the day set.
Again it was so ordered and the Inci
dent of the day gave . way . to routine
business. _____^__^^__
A Blow at Crematories.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Feb. The crematories must
go, declares Senator Hall In the bill he
introduced In the Senate to-day, and his
measure is aimed most directly against
the one in San Francisco.
The title of Mr. Hall's bill is "An Act to
Prevent, the Propagation of Disease
Through Contamination of the Atmos
phere by Gases or Fumes Arising From
Crematories for the Disposition of Gar
bage, Ashes, Offal and Other Refuse Mat
ter, and to Prescribe Penalties." ,It de
clares it a misdemeanor to erect or main
tain any crematory for the destruction by
fire of any refuse matter within the limits
of any city or town*, and then it goes on
to declare it a further misdemeanor to
maintain such a crematory so close to
any city or town that the atmosphere of
the town may be contaminated by it. By
the act it is made impossible to maintain
a crematory anywhere near any city or
town in the State, but so far San Fran
cisco will be the only one affected should
the bill become a law.
Self -Codify Laws.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 7.â Senator Bulla submitted
a constitutional amendment this after
noon,; the effect of which bids fair to lie
far reaching should his efforts in Its be
half prove successful. His amendment
provides that all laws general in their
nature shall be Introduced; In the Legis
lature In the form of amendments to pres
ent sections or additions to one of the
four codes of the State. In this way he
believes that before many years have
passed the laws will codify themselves
and the work of a Code Commission will
be unnecessary.
â¢At present measures are Introduced as
acts,' and these acts, when general,
be taken by the Code, Commission and
made part of the code, but under Senator
Bulla's plan the bills would be Introduced
in such a manner as to make the act part
of "one of the codes immediately upon its
passage.

CALIFORNIA AT THE FRONT.
HOWEVER weary the California volunteers at
Manila may have become during the long
dreary days of waiting that followed the occu
pation of the city, and however eager they may have
been to return home and resume their lives of busy
occupation, we may be sure all such feelings van
ished when the attack of the natives upon our lines
roused them to action and summoned them to battle.
All reports from the Philippines unite in giving to
the' Californians credit for distinguished gallantry
during every phase of the fight. When our lines were
subject to a galling fire from a troop of natives for
tified behind the thick walls of Paco church Colonel
Smith saw the importance of dislodging them, and
promptly ordered an advance. In carrying
out the orders Lieutenant Colonel Duboce
achieved at the head of a small force what
was perhaps the most daring deed of the day. Dash
ing across the open in the face of a heavy fire, he and
his men forced their way into the lower story of the
church, and by setting it on fire compelled the
enemy to fly and abandon their point of vantage.
Again, when in the course of the action the Four
teenth Regulars were in danger of being cut off by a
strong and overwhelming body of Filipinos, it was
the men of the First California who went to their
rescue and drove back the enemy. On still another
occasion Companies X and M of the regiment assisted
the regiments of Washington and Idaho in breaking
the lines of the concealed foe by a charge which led
them across open rice fields, where they were fully
exposed to a heavy fire.
Thus throughout the day the fortunes of the battle
assigned to the Californians the hazardous duties of
the posts of greatest danger. It was theirs to perform
the most conspicuous feats of valor in a . little
army full of brave men. all eager for distinction and
ardent to uphold the credit of their States as well as
the glory of the republic. California at the front has
achieved another honor in the history of the nation,
and from the whole State will go words of greeting
and praise for the gallant men and officers who won
it by the noble performance of dangerous duty.
LIMIT THE RACING.
THE harm accomplished through the continuance
of racing the year around is so marked and ex
plicit, the crimes to which it has led theft, em
bezzlement, murder and suicide â so familiar, that to
more than revert to them is superfluous. Therefore
the opinion that racing should be restricted is general,
the only exceptions being among people who fatten
and batten on the racegoer tout, the vagrant
with a doubtful tip, the "bookie" and the speculator.
Ii these can secure legislative support their power is
a thing to be dreaded.
There has -introduced by Senator Braunhart
a bill directed against gambling, but particularly de
signed to limit the racing season to thirty days. It
is so good a bill we take pleasure in commending it,
embodying, as it does, many points which this paper
has set forth as essential. If racing is to be a stimulus
to the breeding of fine horses there can be no objec
tion to it, but when it becomes a gambling game
wherein the scheme is the fleecing of the ever-
present sucker, it assumes a wholly different aspect,
and is a thing of evil, with no redeeming quality.
Racing in San Francisco is but the pretext for milk
ing the public. It possesses no element of sport. To
sustain it requires many thousands of dollars daily,
and almost all of this comes from people who in
contributing it rob either themselves or their em
ployers, and in either case court disgrace. The* pro-
motcrs of racing wear purple and fine linen, because
they can afford to do so, but the dupes who have
acquired the habit of betting on these same races pay
for. this display, and themselves wear rags.
It is to be hoped that the Braunhart bill will , be
come a law. The purpose of it is altogether worthy.
It is designed to correct a shameful abuse, an' abuse
which is corrupting the youth of the community,
swindling the mature, swallowing up the wages of
men and women, giving no return. Such racing as is
practiced here twelve months in a year is an actual
crime. Since there can be no penalty, the only
method is to check it. or proscribe it utterly. Better
that the tracks should become grass-grown than that
they should continue the scene of an uninterrupted
confidence game, debauching morals and depleting
pockets.
Depositors in the looted San Jose bank are re
ported to feci angry. If this is the limit of the pen
alty to he dealt out to the looters it is well to be
prepared for additional collapses.
Aguinaldo's patriotism is of so rare a brand that
he knows too much to risk it on the firing line.
'â â  ,1.-+ 1' â "';
Senator Shortridge is a man of ideas, but he sel
dom lets go of one of his collection.
WHERE IS THE RESPONSIBILITY?
ON the day of the ratification of the Paris treaty
a statement was published to the effect that
the votes of opposing Senators were secured
by an assurance from the White House that the ad
ministration does not intend a colonial policy in the
Philippines. Quite to the contrary of such a policy,
it was declared to be the intention of the President to
treat the Filipinos like the Cubans, holding them un
der a temporary protectorate, to aid them in the es
tablishment of an independent government, upon con
dition that this country is recouped its expenditures
in their behalf.
We find difficulty in believing this statement to be
true. If such be the intention of the President its
frank declaration any time within the last month
would have removed all opposition to the treaty,
would have taken away friction at Manila and averted
the bloody encounter of last Sunday.
The whole world has been made aware of the as
piration of the Filipinos for independence. They
have shown it with a spirit which commands respect.
The women of Cavite asked to be armed to fight for
it. Had they been assured of our support of that as
piration, instead of suspicion would have been confi
dence, and friendship would have appeared instead of
friction. Granting that their attack on our lines was
an act of folly, which must be punished, and that se
verely, the responsibility for it is not with the Sena
torial opponents of the Paris treaty, but rests wher
ever the purpose of this Government to aid their in
dependence was cherished in secret, instead of being
frankly avowed.' If this Washington statement be true
some one has an account to settle over the bodies of
our own dead and the carnage colored scene of the
third battle of Manila.
The country is so willing to follow the President
that he can afford frankness with the people. The
treaty has been ratified by the votes of anti-imperial
ists. Is the country to understand that Senator Mc-
F.nery's bloodless and colorless resolution of quali
fication is an expression of the purpose which secured
the votes of Faulkner, Gray, Jones of Nevada, Lind
say, McEnery, McLaurin and Mason? If ; so, our
opinion is that it is an inadequate expression, and will
rot satisfy the country. We are refusing to placate
the Filipinos, and our own people are proceeding
blindfolded and in the dark, apparently in the direc
tion of another trap set and baited with "manifest
destiny." If we are to merely assert a Philippine pro
tectorate, a final declaration of independence, and ask
only repayment of our costs, there is a better way j
to such end than the sacrifice of more American
lives, in the slaughter of more thousands of a people
who offer their blood and bodies in the fear that they
have been merely sold to a new master. If we are
able to say, in good conscience, that we have not
bought them, but their independence, from Spain, not
another shot need be fired, not another tear shed in
the home of an American volunteer.
Why should not this assurance go forth as well as j
an order to crush those people? Let us beware of ;
the consequences to ourselves. If this mean con- i
quest and colonization, so be it, but let us not con- |
ceal from ourselves the fact that it will also mean the j
abandonment of every distinctive American policy. ;
If it be permanent conquest, let the original copy of |
the Declaration of Independence which hangs in the
State Department at Washington be no longer pro- !
tected from decay. , Let the parchment rot and the '
Signatures fade, for rwe will have destroyed the spirit i
of the instrument. Let there be also immediate ac- :
ceptance of General Merritt' s declaration that we have
outgrown the constitution, and it no longer deserves |
consideration or respect, and let the Monroe doc- j
trine, just risen to. full glory in its last interpretation, j
be put away as " a childish vagary, inconsistent with j
the imperial policy and manifest destiny of the na- j
tion. [

has closed its doors, and hundreds are mourn
ing the hard-earned dollars they had given into
the care of the institution, there has been afforded an
opportunity for ' reflection. Why should such
calamities be permitted? Is there nothing to safe
guard the people? Is the act of trusting in a bank
simply the yielding to a confidence game? Surely
there is something out of the common when deposit
ors are swindled, possibly ruined.
While the officials of this bank were throwing
money recklessly into schemes which promised no
returns; while they were loaning without security,
gathering the funds to do so by the most profligate
discounts, Paris Kilburn, one of the Bank Commis
sioners, was warming a chair in Republican head
quarters, and nothing cared he for the fate of de
positors. His duty, as he conceived it. although he
drew pay for another, was to throw his influence to
the election of one Dan Burns to the Senate. The
headquarters of a ( great party was prostituted to the
uses of Burns, and the influence of certain Republi
cans, among them Kilburn, was prostituted to the
same end.'
There could be but one result. While Kilburn
warmed the chair the bank progressed toward col
lapse, and when a bank fails it means suffering to
many. All the affairs of this particular bank should
have been to Kilburn as an* open book, but he was
too busy to read. His ambition was set upon the
loftier scheme of sending this man Burns to the Sen
ate. He warmed the chair, the bank kept on its
course toward destruction.
In China the officials of that bank would now be
headless. In more than one civilized country they
would be on the way to penal servitude. In the
United States they do not seem disturbed, and , the
commissioners who permitted their crime to develop
to the point of disaster display no sign of remorse.
The commission must be reformed. It was not de
signed to fatten the Kilburns of politics. 7,7
SLAVERY fJND POLYGAMY.

I "HE existing necessity of thrashing the Filipinos
THE existing necessity thrashing the Filipinos
because of the attempted dislodgment of our
, . forces at. Manila does not affect â¢ the main
question at issue. We are quite. competent to main
tain the occupation we have gained; without any seri
ous disturbance of our balance, and at the same time
discuss the deeper problems that are unaffected by
temporary conditions.
The men who organized the Republican party and
who, in iB6O, secured the election of Abraham Lin
coln, designated slavery and polygamy as "the twin
relics of barbarism." E. D. Baker and Frederick P.
Tracy in this State, with their splendid oratory, de
nounced these institutions as blots upon the fair chart
of the constitution. The deathless invocation to
freedom of Colonel Baker at the American Theater
in San Francisco, in 1861, anticipated a result that the
civil war imbedded in the constitution, with cop
sent of the whole people North and South. Thus, one
of the twins was presumptively buried. When* Utah
was admitted into the Union, it was supposed; that
Congressional legislation had destroyed the other. It
is now proposed by the acquisition of the * Philippines
to reincorporate both, either in a colonial dependency.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1899.
imperially administered, or by a territorial annexation
and the admission of the Filipinos to the ranks of
American citizenship. .
Both slavery and polygamy exist in the Philippines.
What are we to do with them? If we govern the
archipelago as an imperial colony, we must either
tolerate and protect these institutions of barbarism or
plunge into a bloody war, seven or eight thousand
miles away from the soil where Americans are pro
duced, in which an army of a hundred thousand men
would be a bagatelle. If we annex these fourteen
hundred islands and give them a territorial organiza
tion, we must either abandon our principles or the
war is without an alternative. Some of our expan
sionists, who have a "national policy,", are deep in
the crusade against Roberts," the Utah Congressman,
because he is believed to have a plurality of wives.
What will they do with the nine or ten millions of
Filipinos? Do they expect to reconcile the contra
dictory positions of freedom and monogamy on this
continent with slave holding, slave driving and poly
gamy in Asia? Or do they desire the restoration of
the two blots removed from the constitution at so
great a cost, and that the present generation shall wit
ness either the obliteration of the Declaration of In
dependence, or Mohammedan and Pagan representa
tion in the Lower House of Congress?
The cause of the expansionists is rilled with inex
tricable dilemmas, and they are equally unadorned
bj the twin jewels of consistency and of Americanism.
THE opinion is expressed that the passage of the
Hull bill, reaffirming the gold standard and
providing that greenbacks redeemed in gold
shall stay in the treasury until exchanged for gold
will meet all the requirements of financial reform. Of
this, however, there is very grave doubt. The
country knows that gold is already the standard. The
act of 1873 says that "the gold dollar, 25.8 grains in
weight, 900, parts fine, shall be the unit of value."
Of course the term "standard" is not employed, but
that is because "unit" is more scientifically correct,
2nd it means the same thing. This being true, the
only' change introduced by the proposed bill is in
retention of greenbacks, gold redeemed, until asked
in exchange for gold. There are in existence $340,
--000,000 in greenbacks. To preserve the gold unit of
value, when presented at the treasury they are re
deemed in gold, and then, according to existing
law, they must . be reissuedâ that is to say, they are
immediately reprinted and paid out to meet the ex
penses of the Government. This device was provided
in order to prevent contraction of the currency, and
it is responsible for the "endless chain" which has
several times threatened the treasury with insolvency
and nearly compelled a suspension of specie pay
ments. ..' * â  'â â /
It Will be seen that the effect of the Hull bill is to
contract the currency. It is entirely possible to
withdraw gold from the treasury to the amount of
the entire greenback issue of $340,000,000, and under
the proposed act this would lock that sum up to stay
out of circulation until released by an exchange for
gold, something rather improbable to occur. This
would be a contraction of the currency and drainage
of the gold from the treasury at the same time. ,7_
The report of the condition of the treasury on the
31st lilt will give an idea of what this would mean.
At that date there was an available cash balance of
$292,039,626, and the gold reserve was $228,749,075.
Therefore the presentation of the outstanding green
backs would have taken the gold reserve all out.
It will be seen, then, that all the new bill proposes
is this change in handling the greenbacks, and it is
gravely doubtful whether, standing alone, that change
is at all desirable. It is the belief of all the sound
money people that efficient reform requires the pro
gressive retirement and cancellation of the whole
greenback issue, as rapidly as it can be replaced by
a flexible and safe paper currency, issued under legal
safeguards in addition to those already provided by
the national bank law, and with redemption provi
sions that prevent it from menacing the treasury
and imperiling the public credit. Such a system is
free from the objections which lie against both the
present law and the Hull bill. As framed by the
Monetary Commission of the Indianapolis conference
it has other features that are desirable from a financial
and political standpoint. It will put banking facilities
within reach of more of our people, who can then
use their credit more economically than now. . It will
enlarge the opportunity for the use of personal
credit, and will materially decrease the necessity, for
mortgages. The rate* of interest being the same, the
man who is compelled to use his credit by mortgage
is at - a disadvantage, for he must pay for drawing,
acknowledging and recording his mortgage, and
also for an abstract of title. Bad business habits are
inculcated by resort to mortgages. -The money is
usually taken on long time, and a farmer will spend
the pr&fits of many intervening good crops with no
thought of putting by a sinking fund to bear at last
bad crops or prices and concurrent maturity of his
mortgage. With a system of banking which puts
the loan fund of the country within as easy reach of
the farmer as of the merchant and manufacturer, he
will borrow less on short time and provide to pay it
at maturity, and will have the use of his credit more
cheaply and in a way that enforces Â' better business
habits.
All this is a part of the financial reform required by
sound money men, and it is far from being furnished
in the Hull bill. y/7 7 . 7/ <

FINANCIAL LEGISLATION.
INHERITANCE
TAX IS AGAIN
IN THE COURT
The Stanford Estate
Case Reopened.
WITH SUPREME JUSTICES
AN ABLE ARGUMENT BY AT
TORNEY GENERAL FORD.
-. . ... i
He Contends That the State Would
Be Defrauded by an Unconsti
tutional Act of the Leg
islature.
. A case of great importance was argued
yesterday. before the Supreme Court in
bank involving a matter of $60,000 to the
school fund of the State. The subject un
der consideration was whether or not the
legislative act of 1897 amending the act
of 1893 exempting certain heirs from pay
ing the income tax. on. the estates of de
ceased persons is constitutional. The case
ln particular was that of the Stanford es
tate. The decision of this will operate"tn
a number of others Involving large estates
ln various parts of the State. The propo
sition, briefly outlined, is this: 'â "'.
In 1893 the Legislature j imposed an Inherit
ance tax of 5 per cent upon all inheritances,
devises, legacies and bequests, excepting as to
certain enumerated classes, of beneficiaries.
Thereafter, /in the same year, . Senator Stan
ford died, leaving a will by . which he dis
posed of a large estate to various beneficiaries.
Including certain â¢ nieces and nephews, who
were to receive about $1,200,000, and the
Leland Stanford Jr. University, an institution
falling within the excepted clauses as defined
in the amendatory act of 1597. In 1897 the
Legislature attempted to enlarge the excepted
classes by adding .thereto nieces and nephews
residing iii the State of California, and cer
tain institutions such as would include the
Leland Stanford Jr. University.
This is not the first time that the same
matter has been before the Supreme
Court. After the will of the late Senator
was admitted to probate the matter went
to the . higher court upon the constitu
tionality of the act, and not a few be
lieved that the amendment of 1897 was
made with reference to the Stanford es
tate. The appeal was decided last No
vember by the court in department ad
verse to the interests of the State.
*W. F. Fitzgerald, then Attorney Gener^
al, asked that the case be reheard, as he
had never been officially Informed of the
existence of the case and consequently
the State had not an opportunity to be
represented in court. The request was
granted, but Mr. Fitzgerald going out of
office the new Attorney General, Tirey L.
Ford, -took charge of the matter, which
was heard yesterday.
Dr. Taylor represented the resident
nephews and nieces, Cotton & Cotton the
non-resident heirs, and Tirey L. Ford the
State. The points presented by the attor
neys for the heirs were the same as ad
vanced at the former hearing, but those
by the Attorney General were all new.
Mr. Ford attacked the constitutionality
of the amendment of 1897 by asking the
question: "Had the Legislature the power
to thus enlarge the excepted classes so
as to affect the estate of a decedent who
died after the original act had gone into
effect but before the amendatory act was
passed?" "
In his argument Mr. Ford said: /
The second section of the amendatory act ls
void for i the reason that It bears no relation
to, nor ls the subject matter of it referred
to . In, the title of the amendatory act. The
Amendatory act Is void for the reason .that
the Legislature thereby attempted to make a
gift of a right that had theretofore accrued to
the State. ThiÃ right of which the Legislature
attempted to . make a ; gift was ; certainly a
"thing of value." from whatever standpoint
It may be viewed. If it be" considered a tax,
then, by the very terms of the art of '93, it
became due and payable upon the death cf
the | decedent, or. In other words, the State
then became vested with the right to collect
the tax in the due course or me administra
tion, which right could not be deemed less
than a "thing of value." The 5 per cent re
tained belonged absolutely to the State and
was unquestionably a "thing of value" which
the Legislature had no more right to give away
than It would have to give away the capitol
grounds at Sacramento or the money in the
State treasury.
The attempt to include â  the nieces and
nephews residing in California in the ex
cepted classes was clearly in conflict with the
constitution of the United States and the uni
form line of decisions bearing upon the sub
ject. This is admitted, but the principle Is
misapplied by the opinion rendered m depart
ment. | The Legislature attempted to relieve
the nieces and nephews alone, which clearly
could not be done. / No attempt was made to
extend such relief to non-resident nieces and
nephews. If an attempt to impose a burden
on non-residents must fall, an attempt to ex
tend relief I to residents must likewise fall.
If the attempted legislation must be declared
fftvalid In the one Instance It must likewise
be declared invalid in the other.

were made to hold on to a staff, and after
the cupping or bleeding the wound was
wrapped with a long bandage. The band
age and staff were placed outside of shops

Hall of Justice. After extended discus
sion, It was decided to sustain the May
or's veto -of the contract granted the
George H. Fuller Desk Company for the
$80,000 worth of furniture. New bids will
be advertised for at once, and If all prom
ises are. made good the building will be
furnished ready for occupancy on Au
gust 1. y'-'yv "-'
The committee announced that it was
ready to provide every accommodation re
quired .by the Judges in the Criminal De
partment of the Superior Court. They
will be asked to specify their needs, which
will be. attended to. The Judges have
taken the stand that the quarters as
signed them are too small and lack con
veniences necessary for the proper con
duct of their courts. * â¢* r* '*,â
The Supervisors say that as all city
property is under their jurisdiction, the
Judges have no option, but must accept
the quarters assigned them. The Judges
are not above the law, and must abide by
its provisions. â¢
The Building Committee heard a num
ber of interested parties at Its session
yesterday. George H. Fuller, the success
ful bidder, explained the matter of the
contract from his point of view, urging
the committee to stand by the award to
him. He said his bid was $6,000 below the
next bid, and that the city could never
obtain better terms.
Attorney Shadbourne, representing the
North End Improvement Club, devoted
his energies to assailing the stand taken
by the Superior Judges in declining to
accept the quarters prepared for them.
He contended that the board had author
ity over- the Hall of Justice, and jurisdic
tion over the courts. That they were not
a law unto themselves.
O. F. yon Rhein followed In the same
strain, scoring the contractors for the de
lay. Contractor Bateman in reply said a
great injustice had been done him. as the
chief delay was caused by the change of
plans from time to time.

-. way to the more important work of ar
â¢: ranging for obtaining the necessary funds
..â wiih which to give the project a substan
tial basis. It was deemed advisable to
make haste slowly, so as to better insure
the success of the undertaking. There
was no lack of enthusiasm over the mat
ter, but it was well leavened with sound,
business-like discretion, which augured
Well fur future victory.
On calling the meeting to order Chair
man Reinstein stated that it hadbeensug
'l that permanent organization be de
ferred until after the project had been
assured of sufficient funds to make a
proper start. This, he added, would have
to be done through the action of Congress

Charles L. Patton thereupon moved

Mr. Patton suggested that the tempo- i

, of securing financial aid from the Fed

S. H. Friedlnnder moved that the com

â  After considerable discussion in reference
.to the appropriations, John Lackmann sug
. that the sentiment of the people rel

Henry J. Crocker spoke in favor of the
enterprise, pointing out the great com

â  from such an exposition at this time,

SHOT TO KILL
JOSEPH RATTO
Wildly Fired Bullets
Through a Door.
WANTED FOR DEADLY ASSAULT
FAMILY TROUBLES WERE THE
CAUSE OF THE CRIME.
The Shooter Was Thrown Out of His
Brother-in-Law's House
and Tried to Do
Murder.
Andrew Ratto, a teamster living at 3234
Eighteenth street, is wanted by the police
on a charge of assault to commit murder.
The complaining witness is his brother
in-law, Joseph Ratto, a carpenter living
at 52 Erie street.
There has been trouble between the two,
and Monday when Joseph went home he
found Andrew there. He told him to get
out, as he had been the means of too
much trouble already, and Andrew re
torted that he called to see his sister, and
he thought she had as much right as Jo
seph to say whether or not he should visit
the house. Joseph grabbed hold of An
drew and threw him out.
About 7 o'clock that night Andrew re
turned to Joseph's house. He rang the
bell, and Joseph answered the call. As
soon as he opened the door and saw
Andrew standing there he closed the door
again. Andrew was armed with a re
volver, and as the door closed he fired a
shot through it. The bullet whizzed past
Joseph's head and buried Itself In the
wall. Joseph dropped to the floor, and
as he did so another bullet came through
the door and burled itself in the wall.
Another shot was fired, but where the
bullet went is not known. Andrew then
took his departure.
Yesterday Joseph, accompanied by his
wife, appeared before Actin~ Police Judge
Barry and swore to a complaint charging
Andrew with assault to commit murder.
In the meantime Captain James Gtllin
of the Seventeenth-street station had
learned of the shooting and detailed De
tectives Graham and Fitzgerald, with
Sergeant Griffith, to round up Ratto. The
officers surrounded the residence at Eigh
teenth street, but the fugitive shooter had
not returned. At 12 o'clock the same night
the watch going on duty were notified to
arrest Ratto wherever found, but up to
a late hour last night he had not been
found.

WAYS AND MEANS
IN THE ASSEMBLY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO,' Feb. The "Ways and Means
Committee of the Assembly Is In almost
continuous session during these days of
"hurried legislation and Its special pro
vince seems to be the killing off of every
appropriation proposed for any other pur
pose than an actual need. *
One of the first bills considered at to
night's meeting was Assembly bill 10
by Johnson of Sacramento. The bill Is for
the benefit of John Mullan and provides
for an appropriation of $45,616 30 to recom
pense him for the collection of moneys
due the State by the Government for
cash and supplies advanced during the
rebellion. Both Johnson and Assembly
man Camlnetti spoke on the measure and
the committee recommended that it do
pass.
Assemblyman Conrey of Los Angeles
was on hand to argue Assembly bill 208,
of which he is the author. His measure
provides for the appointment of three civil
service commissioners by the Governor
and a general reform of the civil service
in this State. The committee decided to
report it without recommendation.
Mr. Conrey also urged bill 407, which
makes an appropriation of $250 to pay the
claim of the Capital, a Los Angeles jour
nal, for publishing the constitutional
amendments before the last election. No
action was taken upon it.
Assemblyman Rickard's bill 476, appro
priating $10,225 to pay the claim of Law
rence Dunnigan, was laid over without
consideration.
Another bill, 477, by the same author, to
pay the claim of Charles F. Wells'* for
$10,000, was given the same treatment.
Assembly bill 542, by Assemblyman Raw
of El Dorado, provides the regular appro
priation for the maintenance of the
Placervllle-Lake Tahoe wagon road. The
amount asked for is $60,000 and upon a
short explanation by Mr. Raw, the com*
mittee referred it to the Committee on
Roads and Highways.
Johnson's Assembly bill 574. to pay the
claim of Talbot .H. Wallis for $6343 13 in
assigned claims from last session's State
Printing Office employes was recommend
ed for passage. Assemblyman Belshaw's
bill, 597, appropriating $1000 to pay for
the Indexing and compiling of the opin
ions of the Attorney General, was recom
mended for passage.
Secretary of State Curry was on hand
to argue the good points of two bills. One
of them, 617, appropriates $7500 to dig a
well In the Capitol grounds to provide
a drinkable water supply and ample fire
protection. It was reported favorably.
Bill 616, which Mr. Curry also argued, is
the regular biennial measure for the re
lief of John Breuner & Co., the Sacramen
to furniture dealers. The bill makes an
appropriation of $15,000 to buy a new car
pet that ls not needed on the Assembly
floor and hangings and draperies for the
walls. The committee decided to recom
mend its passage.
Assembly bill 618, appropriating $2500 to
pay the claim of the Office Metallic Fur
niture Company, was also recommended
for passage.
Assembly bill 411, appropriating $7500 to
provide Secretary of State Curry's office
with metallic files and cases was reported
favorably, as was Dibble's Assembly bill
95, which provides that the Supreme
Court Commissioners shall be kept in of
fice and $6700 appropriated to pay their
salaries.
Bills 76 to 82, all relative to claims
against the State by residents of Dutch
Flat, were favorably reported, and after
disposing of some minor matters the com
mittee decided to spend next Sunday at
Preston Reform School to look Into the
needs of that Institution.
ROCK CRUSHER BILL
CREATES A BREEZE
"CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 7.â an amendment in
troduced by Assemblyman Knights, the
bill that has lately been formulated to
knock out the use of crushed rock from
the rock crusher at Folsom and thereby
giving* the private quarries a chance to
bid upon the rock supply for streets of
the municipalities and towns was given
the cold shoulder this afternoon by the
joint committees on Labor and Capital
and State Prisons and Reformatories.
The committees have lately visited the
Folsom prison and examined the rock
crusher, etc., and returned seemingly in
favor of the bill, the substance of which
was that the crushed rock from the Fol
som crusher should not be used on any
but the county roads throughout the
State, and when It came before the joint
meeting of the committees this afternoon
the bill was expected to be reported back
to the Assembly with a favorable recom
mendation, but by some quiet manipula
tion an amendment of. Knights was in
serted, and the bill now virtually gives
the State rock crusher the same privileges
it enjoyed before. ? .
After the adjournment of the meeting
some of the members began to realize that
the bill was in a way railroaded through
the committee, and the vows of vengeance
on the morrow were plentiful. It Is prom
ised by those members that the bill will
be killed on its appearance to-morrow.
A JUNKET TO THE

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. The Assembly Commit

poolrooms or places where bets are ac
cepted and recorded on horse races, they
will go on a little junket in the morning
to San Francisco and Oakland and will
make thorough inspection of all of the
poolrooms they can locate. There are two
or three measures now .before each house
of the Legislature, all of them aimed at
the poolrooms and by mutual consent it
has been agreed that the findings of the
Assembly Committee on the matter will
stand for all the bills.

BE AMALGAMATED
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. *7.â Senator Morehouse
has introduced and has managed to
have reported favorably to the Senate
a substitute to a bill recently Intro
duced by Senator Simpson. The substi
tute appears : to be favorable to the

be exacted by the "parties thereof con
taining the terms ana conditions of the
purchase and sale and its execution must
be authorized by the Board of Directors
and ratified by three-fourths of the stock
holders of each of the railroad companies
that are parties to such conveyance and
transfer. That said agreement or con
tract shall be recorded In each county
through which said railroad passes and
provided further that no sale, conveyance
or transfer under this act shall relieve the
franchise or property sold, conveyed or

J. W. GOAD
NOMINATED TO
SUCCEED BOGGS
Result of a Spirited Contest in
the Democratic Senatorial
Committee.
J. W. Goad was chosen last night as
the Democratic nominee for State Sen
ator to succeed the late Senator Boggs.
Much balloting and skirmishing oc
curred before the selection was made,
and a deadlock which might have last
ed for some time was only broken by
the withdrawal of J. C. Reddick of
Mendocino County from the contest.
The nomination is a good one and
when, the final ballot which declared
Goad the choice was taken a general
air of satisfaction prevailed. Goad will
be voted for by the people of his dis
trict at the special election recently
called by Governor Gage.
The Democratic Senatorial Commit
tee, appointed for the purpose of filling
vacancies, met last evening at the
Grand Hotel. It "was composed of
delegates from three countiesâ Glenn,
Colusa and Mendocino. Before leav
ing their respective homes the com
mitteemen had decided upon men
whom they desired to place under the
Senatorial toga, and to many, who
knew the condition of affairs, a repeti
tion of the tussle at the capital, city
seemed imminent. J. C. Reddick claim
ed the solid support of the representa
tion from Mendocino County and J. W.
Goad held his adherents among the
Colusa and Glenn County men. When
to-day they reached this city and be
fore the convention opened it became
a certainty that the entire votes of the
thus divided sections would be cast as
the aspirants predicted. .
"When the meeting was called to or
der about 9 o'clock last evening J. H.
Seawell of Mendocino County occupied
the chair, and E. M. Seahorn of Colusa
acted as secretary. J. H. Seawell de
livered a glowing, eulogy of the man
whom death had cut out of the legisla
tive ranks. He spoke of the loss which
had been sustained by the people of the
State as well as of the district which
he represented, and of his untimely de
mise. "At a time when his absence
would be most felt," said .the speaker,
"he has been called irom among us. His
efforts will never be forgotten by our
people. His untiring energy has secured
for us legislation beneficial to the sec
tion from which he was elected, and he
never took his seat in the halls of leg
islation but what he had in view the ac
complishment of something which
would perpetuate his name among
those at whose hands he secured his
election."
After Seawell's remarks were con
cluded J. C. Reddick was placed in
nomination by the Mendocino delega
tion and J. W. Goad by the Colusa dele
gates. On * the : first . ballot the twelve
delegates from the former county voted
for Reddick and the twelve from Co
ulsa and Glenn counties voted for Goad.
.A second- ballot was taken, but no
change ..resulted. The supporters of
each man stood firm and the results of
the six following ballots which were
taken manifested their intention of re
maining at swords' points and main
taining the deadlock. After the eighth
ballot had been given out Reddick
withdrew his name and left the track
clear for his opponent. Another bal
lot was called for and the entire twen
ty-four votes went for Goad.
Goad is an old resident of the district
from which he was chosen - and will
make an able successor for Boggs. He
is held in universal esteem by the peo
ple of his section and has large inter
ests among them. He is familiar, with
the wants of the State and has devoted
years to a study of the resources and
needs of California." He is a brother
of W. F. Goad, : the capitalist,' who died
in this city a short time ago. - l'-y Cy

MAKE A TEST OP STUART'S DYS-
PEPSIA TABLETS.
â¢ No trouble is more common or more misun-
derstood than, nervous dyspepsia. People hav-
ing it think their nerves are to blame and are
surprised .that they . are not cured by nerve
medicines. The , real seat of the mischief is'
lost sight of. The stomach is the organ to be
looked after.
Nervous dyspeptics often ci". not have any.
pain whatever in the stomach, nor perhaps,
any of the usual symptoms of stomach weak-
ness. Nervous dyspepsia shows itself not ,-in
the stomach so much as in nearly every or-
gan. In some cases the heart palpitates and la j
irregular; in others the kidneys are â¢ affected ;
in others the bowels are . constipated, with
headaches; still others are troubled with loss

gas, sour risings and heartburn.
It is safe to say that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets will cure any stomach weakness or dis-
ease except cancer of the stomach. They cure
sour stomach, gas, loss of flesh and appetite,
sleeplessness, palpitation, heartburn, constipa-
tion and headache.

Race at Ingleside â Montanus
.â¢ Enjoyed an Easy â Four
. ( Choices in Front.
.7 The starters in the mile handicap at In
.feleside yesterday did not finish as they
were played in the betting. The general
â¢ public backed Hohenzollern, the mount of
â¢."â¢Skeets" Martin, at even money. After
finishing In front on four occasions,
"Skeets" made sorry work of It with
Hohenzollern. Taking him back at the
first turn, he afterward sawed wood with
a vigor, arriving at the wire, just after
Johnny Reiff and Libertine had passed it.
Some highly cultivated money, in big and
little chunks, was placed around the ring
on Storm King, but an Indifferent third
â was the best the hack horse could do.
Libertine carried 107 pounds, and ran like I
a wild horse, stepping the distance off in !
i_:_-V_. He was at one time 8 to 1 in the
..â â Ting.
â¢ -Though the fields were large and un
..'â¢.'â¢wieldy, four favorites led their fields out.
â¢Trie riding of "Skeets" Martin was the
feature of the day's sport.
I Kd. Corrigan took the first purse hung
up, with Adoiph Spreckels. The gelding,
with "Skeets" Martin on his back, was
played down to favoritism, and always
prominent, passed El Salado at the pad
dock, winning handily. The latter mare,
from the Baldwin stable, was well sup
ported at odds of 10 to 1. Cavallo made a
good run from the rear, taking the show.
Liberal scratching In the seven furlong
run that followed reduced the field to
eight starters. The Montana bred colt
Montanus, trained by Billy Randall, was
installed a sharp choice. The bay fellow
caught the 75 to 1 shot Silver State as the
wire was eared, and won without much
effort. By dint of considerable persua
sion, Rutter landed Plan in the place, a
* neck ahead of Silver State.
The speedy but somewhat erratic Ame
lia Fonso was a pronounced favorite over
.* ber field in the third event, at six fur
longs. ' She soon showed first to a strag
: gling tart, but was hard ridden at the
. â¢ finish to beat Prom to, a 10 to 1 shot pilot
ed by Turner. Interfered with at the far
turn. Sir Urlan was a close third.
.:* Corrigan' s aged gelding The Bachelor
.* seemed to be about the fit for the mile
and a sixteenth selling affair, and went to !
the post a 7 to 10 chance. Heading j
Meadow Lark when half the distance had ;
been covered, he won easily. Joe Mussle j
finished a hard ridden third, behind the J
Boots entry.
" â¢"â¢'.The six furlong dash that followed re- |
sulted in an upset. Opponent at 9 to 5 l.ad j
. a heavy following, while Zamar and Ho
. â .-ratio were equally well backed at a longer
" .-price. Tom Ryan started his recent pur
.â '.'chase Montallade, and after Zamar and
.-â ' -Horatio had run themselves to a stand
...'etill, Martin came along with Ryan's
' .horse and won hands down. Horatio was
' 'L. placed second over Zamar. The winner i
â¢''was as good as 5 to 1 in the betting.

CYCLE RACERS
READY FOR THE
TOURNAMENT
Track Was Completed
Yesterday.
FASTEST IN THE COUNTRY
JIMMY MICHAEL AFTER THE
FIVE-MILE RECORD.
Fournier and Waller Have Trouble
With the Former's Motor Cycle
Again Elkes Wants a
Match.
- â  . -
The construction of the cycle track in
Mechanics' Pavilion was completed yes
terday, and all is now in readiness for
the big meet which will open there Satur
day night, continuing for two weeks.
Some of the Eastern riders ; tried the
track last night, and pronounce It the
fastest Indoor track they have ever rid
den, upon. It la eight: laps to the mile,
eighteen feet wide and banked three feet
on the sides and nine feet on the curves.
The six-day riders complain of the
track, saying that it is too fast for them,
being built more for men like Michael, to
whom a mile at a 1:50 clip is but play. F.
Ed Spooner, the well-known Eastern cy
cling authority, however, does not think
with them. He says: "The six-day men
will find the track all right; but its steep
ness will cause them to change their tac
tics somewhat. Instead of riding long
stretches at a slow pace, they will rest
often and when on the track will ride
last; they'll have to ride fast or fall off
the banks. In this way the race will be
more dashing, hence more Interesting to
the spectators, and will also be more hu
mane."
The meet will open Saturday night with
short distance professional and amateur
races and a five-mile record trial by
Champion Jimmy Michael, paced by mul
ticycles. Sunday night will see a similar
programme. At five minutes after mid
night Sunday night the big six-day race
will start. There will probably be about
forty entrants, though the killing ride will
cut this field down one-half in about three
days. It is the intention of the promoters
to run short-distance races, record trials
and exhibitions by Michael, Bald and oth
er cracks, on the same track during the
six-day race. Manager Kennedy says
that in Madison Square Garden, New
York, on a track two laps smaller than
this one. * with thirty-four * six-day men
riding on the track, they started an ama
teur mile race with twelve men in a heat.
This will open the eyes of California
wheelmen, who have always thought six
men on a track Indoors was taking a risk
of breaking some one's neck.
When the sprint races are put on, how
ever, the six-day men â¢ ride close to t the
rail in Indian file for the few -minutes
that it takes to run the race, and enjoy
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY B,' 1899.
the relaxation from the monotony of con
tinuously riding around that it affords
them.
Saturday night's programme is arranged
as follows: One mile tandem handicap,
professional; one-half mile handicap, pro
fessional; one mile handicap,, amateur;
club team race for Bushnell trophy; five
mile record trial by Jimmy Michael, paced
by multicycles. Reserved seats will be
obtainable to-morrow at the Emporium,
main floor.
The mile tandem handicap race should
be a "corker"; with the class of riders
now here it is safe to say that they will
hit up a clip that will be hair-raising.
For Instance, McFarland alone can circle
the track in 2 minutes flat; so can Stev
ens; now put them together on a tandem,
and the result can well be imagined.
Henri Fournier, the French champion,
with his gasoline tricycle, and "Dutch"
Waller, the famous long-distance rider,
had a bad tumble across the bay Sunday.
They were en route to San Jose, Fournier
in front with his Infernal machine setting
pace at a 1:40 clip. On the handle bars
of the machine he was carrying Waller's
coat, tied with a string. The string broke,
the coat dropped down into the running
gear, and Henri, "Dutch" and their ma
chine vied with each other rolling in the
gutter. Fortunately no bones were
broken, but "Waller carried his own coat
the rest of the way. The accident hap
pened near Mount Eden, but Fournier
does not think the place is particularly
â¢well named. Htf -,
Harry Elkes, the American middle-dis
tance champion, whose arrival here was
I noted in yesterday's Call, says that his
one aim in coming this far was to get a
match with Jimmy Michael, the world's
champion, at any distance up to thirty
three miles. Elkes is the first American who
ever held the world's hour record, which
he made when he defeated the famous
English rider, Tom Linton. The record
stands at 34 miles 1223 yards, and Elkes
j thinks he can Improve it In a match with
Michael and win the race, too. In Elkes'
race with Linton he rode the fourteenth
mile in 1:35 1-5, equaling the world's rec
ord for that distance, flying start.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen will hold
an Informal entertainment in the gym
nasium and a high jinks in the wheel
men's rooms to-night, in honor of the
visiting wheelmen.
Eddie Bald, the champion short-distance
rider of the world, will lead the cotillon
to-night at the fourteenth anniversary
ball of the Bay City Wheelmen, to be held
ln the Palace Hotel maple room.
Reception to Rev. Mr. Brooke.
The annual meeting of the First Uni
tarian Society of San Francisco was held
last evening. Incidental to it was a re
ception to the Rev. Stopford W. Brooke,
who recently came to * fill the , place of
Horatio Stebbins, resigned. Reports were
read by the Channlng Auxiliary . Society
of Christian Work, Postoffice Mission,
Sunday-school, Hlnkley trust fund and
Hathaway trust fund. Each report gave
evidence of the good work which had
been done during the year by the several
societies and showed sound financial
standing.
At the reception, which immediately fol
lowed the meeting, about three hundred
members of the congregation participated.
Congratulations and addresses of good
fellowship were delivered and the new
pastor was warmly j welcomed.

HIBERNIANS
CLOSE THEIR
CONVENTION
Vast Good to the Or

WATCHWORD IS "EXPANSION"
NEW BOARD GRANTED EXTRA
ORDINARY POWERS.
A Banquet in the Evening at Which
Colonel Smith and the Califor
nia Boys at Manila Are' 77 7'
Remembered.
* "Colonel James F. Smith, Manila: *
* The State Convention, Ancient Or- *
* der Hibernians, from the banquet *
â X- board cheer your name and send *
* greetings to you and your brave -X
* California boys." *
* â¢â *â¢â â¢'-. *
The Ancient Order of Hibernians seems
destined in the near future to renew its
vigorous growth of former days and far
outstrip all similar societies in point of
membership.
The State Convention finished its labors
yesterday, and the measures adopted pro
viding for the welfare of the order guar
antees that the Hibernians will, before
long, be floating on the* crest of prosper
ity such as it has never known before.
Yesterday's proceedings were devoted
almost entirely to considering and acting
upon amendments to the by-laws, and
defining the scope of the Board of Ex
pansion that has Just been created. The
board was given absolute power within
the State to adopt such means as it may
consider best to promote the growth and
welfare of the order, and to carry out its
plans it was decided to levy an assessment
of 50 cents a year on each member. as
there are at present about 3000 members
of the order in the State, this will give the
board a fund of $1500 at the outset to
work on.
The following gentlemen were elected
members of the board for the ensuing
year: P. J. McCormick, San Francisco;
Frank Conklin, San Francisco; T. H.
Carr, Nevada City; M. Farrell, Santa
Clara; James Smith, Oakland. The mem
bers will begin an active canvass of the
State at once. They have several plans
partly formulated by which they expect
to arouse new Interest in this pioneer of I
Irish societies, and they confidently ex
pect to double the present membership
within a year. Established divisions will
be rejuvenated and new divisions organ
ized ln every section.
The convention also selected the follow
ing Finance Committee, which will have
charge of all State funds with the ex
ception of that provided for the Board of
Expansion: J. J. Donohue, San Fran
cisco, chairman; Martin Dalton, San Jose;
P. N. Hanrahan.
The following resolution regarding the
California boys at Manila was offered and
adopted with cheers:
"Whereas, In the conflict in the Phil
ippines the Eighth Army Corps, com
posed largely as It is of men of Celtic
blood, has shown like valor in the tnre of
the enemy as distinguished our brothers
of the army and navy there and else
where In our conflict with Spain, and
whereas, we have learned through the
press dispatches of the most glorious suc
cess of this corps in the recent assault
on our lines and of the valor of the First
California Regiment; therefore be it
"Resolved, That this California State
Convention of the Ancient Order of Hi
bernians extend to the soldiers in the
Philippines, many of whom are members
of our noble order, its congratulations on
their victory, Its condolences for the
gallant lives sacrificed and Its hopes for
a speedy termination of hostilities."
Another resolution protesting against
the proposed American-British alliance
was also adopted without a dissenting
voice, as follows: â  _Â«.___â ____
"Whereas, The emissaries of the British
Government have for some years been
endeavoring to entangle this nation in a
so-called alliance; and
"Whereas, The experience of the United
States with Great Britain in the Revolu
tion, in the war of 1812. in the Mexican
War and in the Civil War should serve
as warning against any overtures of this
nature; and *â¢-.'.â¢>
"Whereas, It Is right and proper for us
to protest against a threatening evil to
our beloved country, as good citizens and
through our Irish blood that has been
shed on every battle-field from the Revo
lution all down through the years against
this deadly foe of the country, for,
whether in the open or by treachery, she
has always proved herself the enemy of
American institutions; therefore, be it
"Resolved, That this convention of the
A O. H. protests against any alliance
with Great Britain for the reason that
such alliance would be against the best
Interests of this country, would be un
natural in view of England's brutal rec
ord, of her tyranny, of her butchery, and
that we appeal to all lovers of liberty to
take position against any alliance between
the two countries or of any union of the
stars and stripes with the red flag of des
potism, which floats only for privilege as
against liberty and is the symbol of force
and conquest and greed and lust wherever
planted." 7- . . _ .
The memory of the late Colonel John
O'Byrne was honored by the following
resolution:
"Whereas, God in his infinite wisdom has
taken from our midst a blessed brother.
Colonel John O'Byrne, a man who was
held in high repute for his noble charac
ter, unselfish devotion to purpose and for
his pure patriotism; and
"Whereas, In . his life work Colonel
O'Byrne represented the best type of Irish
manhood and character. He was a brave
man, a fearless soldier, but gentle as a
woman. He was a distinguished scholar,
poet, orator and writer, but unostenta
tious and without pretense. He was gen
erous and liberal, but without display.
His heart beat with warm sympathy for
Ireland and he voiced his sentiments with
living eloquence and ; wrote with
the force and effect of a great
talent -nnder-' convictions of a lov
ing duty to his motherland. At- an
American citizen he fought for principles
and for the people with all the strength
of his energetic nature, inspired by a love
for the constitution and the principles of
our Government. From a boyhood when
his teaching was under the influence and
direction of parents who gave to him the
insptr.t'on that comes ...of. unsullied
and distinguished Irish lineage, he en
tered on his young manhood and selected
for his associates the chosen spirits who
were engaged in the cause of Ireland. He
brought into his work the broad education
that his native talent htd enriched. Into
the years of middle life in the Eastern
States, where his lot was- cast, he labored
with fidelity and his leadership was un
questioned. When the country was en
gaged In the great strife of the Civil War
he was for the Union and the flag had no
truer defender than Colonel O'Byrne. In
his profession he took rank with the fore
most minds of the day. In all his varied
history he was an honor to the race and
an Irishman whose record made him
worthy of the confidence and respect of
the whole people; therefore, be it -.-".-.-â 
"Resolved, That we offer this as a trib
ute to his memory; that it is a token of
our appreciation of; his noble character
and of his services to faith and. country;
that we regret his death as a distinct loss
to every good cause, and that we tender
our sincere condolence to his dear widow
and family; that these resolutions be en
tered on our minutes and copies sent by
our State secretary as directed."
In the evening 125 delegates to the State
convention and Invited guests sat down to
a banquet at the Maison St. Germain, on
O'Farrell street. P. :J. McCormick i pre
sided, and at his right sat State President
J. J. Donovan, while Rev. D. O. Crowley,
State chaplain, was seated on his left. It
was 10:30 o'clock when the gentlemen en
tered the banquet hall and Father Crow
ley asked divine â  blessing on those pres
ent. The banquet was * given by the San
Francisco divisions to the delegates, ev
erybody present doing ample Justice to it,
for the session of the convention had last
ed from tbe afternoon until well into the
evening before the : work was completed
and final adjournment taken.
During the repast the following cable
gram was dispatched to Colonel James
F. Smith of the First California Regiment
in Manila:
"Colonel James F. Smith, Manila: The
State Convention, Ancient Order of r.i
bernians, from the banquet board cheer
your name and send greetings to you and
your brave California boys."
When it was read to the banqueters pro
longed cheers were given for the gallant
Smith and his heroic command.
When the last of the edibles disappeared
the chairman again rapped for order and
proposed a toast to the United States,
which was eloquently responded to by
Tax Collector Edward I. Sheehan. This
was followed by "The A. O. H.." to which
Michael Farrell spoke; "Our Sister Socie
ties," ex-Supervisor Jeremiah Deasy: "The
Church and Civilization," Rev. D. O.
Crowley: "San Francisco," Mayor James
D. Phelan; "The Pacific Ocean and Inter
national Exposition in 1901." James D.
Carr; "Our Boys at Manila," S. R.
O'Keefe; "Civil and Religious Liberty,"
Judge Robert Ferral; "The Day We
Celebrate," J. J. Donohue; "The Ladies,"
J. P. Dignan. This concluded 'he set
speeches, but the delegates lingered long
at the tables, good stories and witticisms
speeding the minutes until hours after
midnight. -
WANT TO RESTORE KIM
TO LEGAL STATUS
Attorney Thornton's Plea to the Su
preme Court to Have a Convict
. Declared Capable of In-
V ./â¢â â  heriting.
Whether or not the conviction and sen
tence of imprisonment for life of James
J. Donnelly operates In law to divest him
of any share in his father's estate is a
question that the Supreme Court will have
to decide within the next ninety days.'
Arguments on this novel legal point were
submitted to . the appellate court sitting
in bank yesterday by the attorneys for
the estate of Thomas Donnelly, deceased,
and Charles J. Stillwell, to whom the con
vict son assigned his claim.
j The elder Donnelly died intestate in the
early part of 1896, leaving surviving him
five children and property valued at $25,
--000. j Prior to ; his death his son James
J. was convicted of the crime of robbery
and was sentenced to San Quentin for
the term of his natural life. The latter on
learning of his father's demise trans
ferred his claim on the estate to Charles
J. Stillwell for a valuable consideration,
and Stillwell made effort to secure the
convict's share.
In distributing the estate Judge Coffey
excluded the convict son on the ground
that he was civilly dead. Through his at
torneys Stillwell appealed and the mat
ter came up for hearing in the Supreme
Court yesterday. Besides importuning the
members of that august body to declare
the convict son alive, Crittenden Thorn
ton, who argued the case, was called upon
to defend his alleged action of perfecting
his appeal too prematurely and serving
and filing his notice of appeal before the
judgment of the lower court was entered
at length, as required- by law.
The point raised by Mr. Stillwell's coun
sel, which Is a novel one, has never been
decided in this country. A section in the
Penal Code declares that a convict is civ
illy dead, but whether or not he can take
by Inheritance has never been determined.
To Improve the North Side.
A meeting of the North Central Im
provement Association was held in the as
sembly hall of the Mills building yester
day afternoon. By a series of resolutions
the association petitioned the Board of
Supervisors to grant the franchise asked
by the Market Street Railway Company
for the operation of electric cars over
Sixth, Taylor, Geary, Montgomery and
Sansome streets: also to repave Sansome
and to repair Montgomery streets. The
question of the occupancy of the new Hall
of Justice by the Judges of the various
courts, and their objection to having their
chambers and courts removed from the
City Hall, came before the meeting and
a resolution will be presented to the
Board of Supervisors urging them to com
pel the Judges to occupy the quarters
which will be fitted up for them in the
new building. , v.\
The association was recently organized
for the purpose of putting life Into the

CENTURY CHAPTER.
A New Subordinate of the Order of
the Eastern Star Instituted.
A new chapter of the Order of the East
ern Star was instituted last night in
Franklin Hall on Fillmore street by As
sistant Grand Patron George L. Darling,
assisted by Grand Secretary Mrs. Kate
J. Y/lllats and acting grand officers se
lected from the several local chapters.
The new chapter is called Century, and is
made up mainly of the membership of
King Solomon Chapter, which went out of
existence shortly before the session of
the Grand Chapter last October.
Some time prior to that date there was
some trouble In King Solomon Chapter,
which resulted in the forming of two fac
tions, which could not harmonize. Cer
tain matters came up which were dis
cussed at length and were finally referred
to then Grand Patron Rowe, who directed
the chapter to comply with a certain re
quirement. The order was not obeyed,
and a second order was issued, and that
was likewise ignored. For this the grand
patron adjudged the chapter guilty of In
subordination and arrested the charter.
His action was sustained by the Grand
Chapter, after which each faction pre
sented a petition to Grand Patron Law
rence for a dispensation to organize a new
chapter. . ,
After considering the matter for a long
time he granted a dispensation, author
izing the institution of a chapter with
seventeen members, striking off a number
of names from one of the petitions, so as
to bring the number down to the consti
tutional limit. The organization was ef
fected last night, and about thirty mem
bers were Initiated.

Dance Given at the xiotel

Consolidation of the Two Rival Com
panies at Last Effected and Com
petition Excluded for Years. .
The New Concern to Be Capitalized at Nine
Million Dollars-Directors Agreed and
Only Waiting on Action of Stock
holders.
OAKLAND, Feb. 7. â There is now but one water company in Oak
land. The consolidation has at last been effected, and now nothing re
mains but for the stockholders of the Contra Costa Company to ratify
the action of the directors.
The deal was closed last evening and the result was very apparent
on the Stock Exchange to-day when the stock ran up to figures unpre
cedented in years.
The effect of this consolidation cannot
be told at this time, and as the water
'â¢ rates are to be fixed at once the import
ance of the movement Is supreme. It can
â¢not fail to have a very pronounced bear
ing on the rates to be paid for water dur
'. ing the next fiscal year. The big deal was
- arranged several weeks ago and all the
. * details were published in The Call of Jan
*â  vary 20. At that time the only hitch to
"â¢-the consummation of the deal was the
. . difference in the valuations of the two |
â¢* companies placed upon the plant recently
â¢'.'. acquired at Mount Eden by the Contra
Costa Company. The annual report of the
'. Contra Costa Company, filed last week,
* Ehows this plant to be considered as worth
; . . $t"9.569. As the Dingee Company only con
* sidered this plant worth about $8000 the
' negotiations were hung up. Now every;
7 thing has been aujusted. the directors
* 'have agreed on everything and the whole
'. matter only awaits the sanction of the
â¢Ftockholders. As the stock of the Oak
'â :. land Company is all held by Alvinza Hay
â V -ward, W. J. Dingee and a few associates,
â¢: * -and ib they are the directors of that
: ; company, there will be no opposition from
*.;that source. As the Contra Costa stock
â¢ .; has been down to $30 per share and has
.-.-."now shot up to $67 50, the stockholders of
'â¢'that concern are not likely to oppose the
.c-eaj. made by their directors, and the deal
'. W considered by all concerned to be
'*. ..-.: closed.
â "*. 'Last frill the stock was down to $35. On
.' January 20 this year it caused excitement
7-. by jumping up to $63 and to-day it flew to
', ' â¢'.s*jf 50. and the buyers of the stock who
7 .were not informed of what had happened
were thrown into a panic. It is stated
- Xh-at'JTO will be asked when the Stock Ex
â¢Â» .change opens to-morrow.
'" The consolidation leaves It an open
â¢ i .question as to whether the Pierces of the
â¢ old company or the Hayward faction is in
â /.'control of the combination. The Oakland
: company has been given three million dol
". . lairs of stock and its one million dollars

I the stockholders will be only too glad to
I accept the conditions that make competi-
I tion in the water supply of this city an
Impossibility for many years and perhaps
for all time.
I The plan of consolidation capitalizes the
I combined companies at $9,000,000. This
| amount is made up of the Oakland com
pany's bonds, the Contra Costa bonds, the
$3,000,000 worth of stock issued by the
j Contra Costa Company, and the remaining
$3,000,000 In its treasury, now turned over
I to Hayward, Dingee and their partners.
In a few days the office of the Oakland
Water Company will be closed and all the
â¢ business will be transacted by the old
; Contra Costa Company. The competition
: that has been in existence for four years
! closed on the first of the year, when the
companies commenced to charge under
\ the new ordinance. The indifference mani
fested by the companies when dissatis
i faction was expressed was taken to mean
' that there was no likelihood of rate cut
ting and this indication is now proved to
have been absolutely true. -yyy >y
The annual meeting of the Contra Costa
I Company will be held in April, and there
i will undoubtedly be many changes in the
I management. About two years ago, when
I competition was at its height. Contra
Costa stock fell from par to $30, and there
| was great fear that Hayward would get
in and obtain a majority of the stock at
: the low figures. This was feared by
, Messrs. Prescott, Tom Brown and Whit
â¢; tier. and they at once formed a large pool,
, composed of a controlling amount of the
1 stock, and agreed that under no condition
should any of such stock be disposed of
| for two years. At the annual election last
j April the pool, which was friendly to the
j Pierces, voted, and of course retained
\ control. Next month this pool goes out of
i existence, and as the 30,000 shares that
have now passed into the control of
Hayward and Dingee will be voted, the
result cannot be foretold at this time.
When Contra Costa stock fell to $30
water rates were proportionately low.
When the stock reached $50 the rates were
! doubled. With stock at $63, 40 per cent
, was again added to the rates. Should
j the stock reach par and rates rise in the
I same proportion, water will cost as much
' as rent. â -.;. v..yy.v.:,
Palace Hotel, regarded the acquaintance
as desirable. Mr. Smith encouraged the
lawyer in these ideas and finally when
the time was ripe and the New Yorker's
purse was low. he induced Mr. Montague
to part with- $200 in the coin of the land
That was on December 17 and Mr. Smith
drew a draft on the State Bank of Hart
ford, Conn., to be paid on sight or order,
which the San Francisco lawyer cashed.
Nine days later Mr. Smith wanted more
money and evidently believing in holding
on to a good thing, drew up a draft for
$250, this time on James J. Goodwin of
New York.
This too the accommodating lawyer
cashed. On that day, December 28, was
presented the first draft for payment, but
it was returned dishonored, the excuse
being that Mr. Smith had no money to his
credit in the bank named. Of course there
was some mistake and Mr. Goodwin of
New York was communicated with. Here
again was another disappointment, for
Mr. Goodwin's reply, so far as can be
learned, was that before Mr. Smith left
the East Goodwin told him not to at
tempt to draw any money on his name.
The $250 draft was also dishonored, and
much as the lawyer disliked to expose the
fact that he had been taken in, he was
obliged to sue or lose the money. The
latter was not to be seriously considered
and this is why he brought action for the
amounts he had advanced on the
worthless drafts. More than this he
asked for $45 damages, $20 for the dis
honor of the first and $25 ditto for the
last, or a total of $495.
Mr. Montague's claims are based upon
the ground of fraud, for he asserts, so
it is said, that Smith represented that the
bills would be paid promptly, and that
Smith, in making the drafts, well knew
that he was guilty of fraud. Mr. Monta
gue s annoyance was increased by the
Information that the man who owed him
the money was about to leave town and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1899.
HELPED DESTROY
CERVERA'S FLEET
The Battleship lowa Arrives in Port After Cov
ering the Distance Between New York
and San Francisco in 117 Days.
THE United States battle ship lowa arrived ln port yesterday after her long run from New Tork. Were It not
for the fact that she is flying light no one would ever think the warship has been at sea almost continuously
since last October. She is spick and span and came up the bay looking every inch a fighting machine.
Pilot George Scott brought the battle ship In, and in heading for an anchorage took her close In along the
water front,' so that the thousands of people who lined the wharves got a good view of the man of war that
did such excellent service at Santiago. All the tugs and ferry boats saluted the stranger and the ships at an
chor in the bay dipped their flags. The Pomona at Broadway wharf and the tugs at Vallejo street were the first to
take up the salute, and from there until the lowa was anchored off Folsom street wharf the din was continued until
the. people uptown thought another Manila expedition was under way.
The battle ships Oregon and lowa, the refrigerating steamers Iris and Celtic and the colliers Justin and Scindia
sailed from New York in company on October 12, bound for San Francisco. The first stop was at Bahla in Brazil.
From there the fleet went to Rio de Janeiro and thence to Montevideo in Uruguay. At all these points the water in
the boilers of the war ships was replenished from the supply ships and the colliers refilled their bunkers.
The next stopping place was at Sand Point, at the entrance of the Straits of Magellan in the Atlantic. Passing
through the straits, the supply ships led the way and the entire fleet anchored each night. The passage was made
â without mishap and the next stopping place was Callao ln Peru. :"7;"".. v -7 '
At Callao Instructions were awaiting the Oregon to proceed to Manila via Honolulu and for the Iris and Scindia
to accompany her. Accordingly, on January 14, when 600 miles northwest of Callao, the fleet broke In two, the lowa,
Celtic and Justin coming on to San Francisco and the Oregon, Iris and Scindia proceeding to Hawaii. The Celtic ar
rived here on February 1 and the Justin on February 3. This trio had kept in company until the Gulf of Cali
fornia was reached. In Magdalena Bay the Celtic put the last of her supplies aboard and came on here. The
Justin put Into the battle ship's bunkers all the coal she could spare, and she also came on to San Francisco. The
lowa was then cleaned up, after which she proceeded, arriving here at 1 p. m. yesterday.
The officers of the lowa are: Silas W. Terry, captain; Raymond P. Rodgers, lieutenant commander; W. H.
Schentze and H. M. Witzel, lieutenants; G. Tarbox, lieutenant, junior grade; N. C. Twining and D. M. Wood, en
signs; V. S. Houston, J. W. Graeme, A. J. Hepburn, W. C. Asserson, O. G. Murfln, H. Williams, A H. McCarthy. A
J. Graham and H. L. Collins, navel cadets; M. H. Simons, surgeon; R. P. Crandell, passed assistant surgeon; H. D.
Averill, assistant surgeon; J. A Ring, paymaster; C. W. Rae, chief engineer; J. R. Morris and D. M. Garrison, assist
ant engineers; F. C. Brown, chaplain; L. Karmany, Captain U. S. M. C; H. C. Davis, second lieutenant U. S. M. C;
C. W. Loomls, pay clerk; E. M. Isaac, boatswain; C. Charette, gunner, and F. Johnson, carpenter. The lowa also
carries 500 bluejackets. i
The lowa was built under an act of Congress of July 19, 1892, by the Cramps, and was launched in March, 1596.
The contract price was $3,010,000, including hull and machinery. She Is 360 feet long, 72 feet broad and draws 24 feet
of water. As a battle ship she has been almost as great a success as the Oregon, and did excellent service during
the destruction of Cervera's fleet. She met with a slight mishap to her machinery during the voyage, to San Fran
cisco and will have to be overhauled before she can go to sea again. j The " crew .'" hailed with delight the news from
Manila and one and all wished they were in the fignt with Dewey.
The lowa will remain in the bay for some time to come and will be thrown open to the public on Sundays and
Wednesdays of each week. :

BERNAL PARR.
The Supervisors Have Ordered Its
Construction.
The residents of Precita Valley are
more than pleased at the prospect of hav
ing Bernal Park established. The site
the Precita Valley Improvement Club has
selected is a small piece of land belonging
to the city lying between the fork of the
two Precita avenues at the base of Ber
nal Heights. The place has been In. the
past a receptacle for all manner of refuse
and stagnant water.
To fill this hollow to grade there is suf
ficient rock within a hundred yards of tne
place, and the expense of beautifying tne
site and making it the pleasure-ground of
the valley will not exceed a few thousand
dollars. Supervisor Aigeltinger, chairman
of the Street Committee, with the Su
perintendent of Streets, visited the valley
a few days ago and instructed the con
tractor to go ahead with the work of
filling the place up to grade. As soon as
this is done then the top dressing and
other flnlshlng-off process will be applied.
The completion or Bernal Park Will be
duly celebrated by crowning President
Graham of the Improvement club king
of Precita Valley, as It was chiefly though
his efforts that the park ls to be estab
lished. -

SUGGESTS A NEW
LIGHTING CONTRACT
ATTORNEY LANE ADVISES SU
PERVISORS ON GAS QUESTION.
Agreements With Two Companies
Have Been Declared Invalid and
New Ones Are Needed.
City and County Attorney Lane sub
mitted an opinion to the Supervisors yes
terday interpreting Judge Seawell's de
cision declaring the electric and gas light
contracts invalid. Attorney Lane advises
the board that the contract with the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Light Com
pany is void, but that that fact does not
absolve the Supervisors from paying rea
sonable compensation for light furnished
the city in December.
a He holds that the bills in question have
been allowed, and are in the hands of the
Auditor, hence the board has nothing fur
ther, to do with them. They have a duty
to perform, however, in advertising for
bids and entering upon a new contract.
Judge Seawell held that the contract with
the San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany is invalid, and that the contract with
the Pacific Gas Improvement Company is
identical and open to the same objections
as to its validity.
The controversy developed over bills for
August and September of last year
amounting to $48,842 41. The opinion re
cites: v-.'" i :V. . V
The Board of Supervisors approved these
demands, which then went to the Auditor
for his approval. At this point "W. R. Sum
merhayes. as a taxpayer, began suit against
the Auditor and the Treasurer, asking that
these officials be restrained and enjoined,
the one from auditing and the other from
paying these demands. Thereupon a tempo
rary Injunction was issued. The Auditor
and Treasurer moved later to dissolve this
injunction, and Judge Seawell granted the
motion and the Injunction was dissolved.
Thus these demands are left in precisely
the same position they were prior to the 1
bringing of the injunction suit: they are
presumably in the hands , of the Auditor
awaiting his approval. The Board of Su
pervisors at this time has no more control
over them than it had while the injunc
tion was pending.
McKAY WAS THE "ANGEL."
Troubles of a Disbanded Comedy
Company Told in Court.
The hearing of the case of Henri Stu
art, charged by A. H. McKay, a re
turned Klondiker, with obtaining money
by false pretenses, was commenced before
Judge Graham yesterday.*
McKay became acquainted with Stuart,
and McKay's wife being ambitious to go
on the stage Stuart and W. H. Wheeler
agreed to get up a company and play the
farce-comedy "My "Neighbor's Wife."
Stuart was to be manager and Whee-er
advance agent. The company opened in
Reno, Nev. The first night's receipts were
$91, but the second night the receipts only
amounted to $105. Then McKay thought
he had enough of playing the "angel" and
the company was disbanded. He dropped
about $900.
: The charge of obtaining money by false
pretenses was based upon the fact that
Stuart got $10 from McKay for royalty on
the play, â  whereas it; could be purchased
anywhere for 25 cents. The further hear
ing will be continued Friday. ... â

STATUS OF
CALIFORNIA'S
NATIONAL GUARD
Opinion of the State's
Attorney General.
MEN WHO ARE IN AND OUT
NO PENALTY FOR HAVING LESS
THAN FIFTY MEMBERS.
Those Officers and Men Who Did Not
Enlist in the Volunteer Army
Are Still Guards
men.
Attorney General Tirey L. Ford has fur- !
nished Adjutant General Peeler an opinion
as to the standing of the National Guard
of the State of California, in answer to
the followng questions asked by the ad- ;
jutant general:
Firstâ What ls the legal present stand
ing of those members of the National
Guard who entered the service of the
United States In the Spanish-American
war?
Secondâ What is the legal status of |
those members of the National Guard who
belonged to the companies of the guard :
at the outbreak of the Spanish-American !
war, but who did not enter the United i
States service? *r '"-
Thirdâ What is the present status of
those companies of the National Guard
which volunteered and entered the United
States service and have since been mus
tered out of such service?
Fourthâ is the present status of
those companies of the National Guard
which volunteered and entered the United
States service and have not yet been
mustered out of that service? .*,-.:
The Attorney General in his opinion
says: "Those members of the National
Guard who entered tne service of the
United States In the Spanish-American
war are not now members of the Na
tional Guard unless they have been re
admitted to that organization in the man
ner prescribed by law. If an entire com
pany volunteered, leaving no portion of
such company behind, the same rule
would apply and such company would
thereupon cease to be a component part
of the National Guard."
As to the second matter, he says that
those members of the National Guard who
belonged to the companies at the out
break of the war and did not enter the
service of the United States are still
members of the guard unless their con
nection therewith has been otherwise sev
ered. 'V:< r ': : V : vyrv~y\y.
After quoting a number of sections of
the law bearing on the case, he says that
a national guardsman enlists for a speci
fied time; that if he complies with all the
military requirements he is entitled to
certain exemptions; that there is no ex
press provision in the law for the dis
charge of companies or the discharge of
the men. except by their own acts, other
than the provisions contained In the
Political Code; and that there is no ex
press penalty or forfeiture attached to
any company for having a membership
of less than fifty men. In view of this
fact he is of the opinion that the guards
men cannot be discharged from the ser
vice and deprived of their privilege of
exemption by mere implication, and with
out any act of their own, before their
term of enlistment expires, which would
be the case if, by reason of the mem
bership being reduced below fifty, the
company should be ipso, facto disbanded.
This would be adding a penalty not pro
vided by the code. They are, therefore,
still members of the guard.
Overhauling Siebe's Work.
The work of Assessor Siebe during his
administration came in for a scorching re- j
view at the meeting of the Sunset Im- j
provement Club last night. The little hall j
where the club met was packed with prop
erty owners and the evening's debate was I
on the assessments made by Siebe of the i
district from First avenue to the ocean
and south of Golden Gate Park. j
It was charged that property was as- :
sessed for a good deal more than it is j
worth in the market. This assessment
had been protested against at the time it
was made, but to no purpose, as the As
sessor turned a deaf ear to all applica
tions made to him for a reduction. A new
deal is expected from Assessor Dodge and
to aid him in a just and fair rate the I
following committee was appointed to :
wait on him: Richard Keller, S. Getz and
Daniel Foley. This committee Was in
structed to ask for a 40 per cent reduc
tion all round on the area mentioned.
Another cause of complaint of which
the club spoke is that of the postal serv
ice in the Sunset district. The delivery of
letters takes longer to reach the parties

SOMERS GOT A VERDICT.
A Jury Gives Him a Judgment in an
Old Contest.
In Judge Troutt's court last evening the
jury in the case of Charles F. Somers
vs. California Savings and Loan Society
brought in a verdict for plaintiff. Maud
Nolan and George Heazelton, executors of
the will of the late Mabel Treadwell, ap
peared as joint associates with the de
fendants in the suit. The case excited
! much Interest because of the bitterness
j with which it has been contested.
It appears that during the lifetime of
! Mrs. Treadwell, Somers was engaged In
' litigation with his wife. He turned over
I to Mrs. Treadwell the $14,000 to be depos
! ited in the California Savings and Loan
j Society for him.
Prior to the death of Mrs. Treadwell,
Somers obtained from her an assignment
'â . showing his right and title to the money.
When Mrs. Treadwell died Maud Nolan,
formerly Maud Treadwell, and George
Heazelton, executor of Mrs. Mabel Tread
well, claimed the money as being the
I property of the latter. During the course
: of the trial defendants produced Professor
I Ames, handwriting expert, who testified
that the assignment given Somers by Mrs.
I Mabel Treadwell was a forgery. The
plaintiff produced witnesses whose evi
dence offered in rebuttal was to the ef
fect that the assignment was genuine.
Probate Judge J. V. Coffey testified that
the assignent was in Mrs. Treadwell a
handwriting. â¢ ,
! The question of Somers character came
. up. and when the attorney for the defend
ant asked a pointed question of a wit
ness named Whitney, who was testifying
as to Somers' character, the latter leaned
over to Attorney Campbell and whis
pered, "You know that is a He. for
which he was fined $20 by Judge Troutt
for contempt of court. The Jury was only
i out a short while. Somers states that he
â¢ brought the suit merely as a matter or
principle, as the case will cost him more
: than he can ever hope to get out pf the
I California Savings and Loan Society.
BANKS TAKE A HAND
IN TAX OFFICE FIGHT
THEIR OWN CLERKS MAKE OUT
THE BELLS.
Pending the Settlement of the Con
troversy Between Supervisors
and Tax Collector
They Act. 7*7
The banks have taken a hand in the
controversy between Tax Collector Shee
i ban and the Supervisors over the employ
ment of deputies in the office of the
former. The Hibernia Bank placed three
clerks at work yesterday, with the sane
; tion of Mr. Sheehan, to expedite the
j preparation of the bills for the property
on which they pay taxes.
! The German Bank is expected to adopt
'. tho same course. These institutions want
â  to have their bills paid before the Ist of
i March, otherwise they must account to
I the Assessor for that amount of money
on hand. "7,7 7_- r *
The mandamus proceedings will be
I heard by Judge Hebbard on Friday, at
which time it is expected the question of
'. the appointment of clerks necessary in the
handling of the business of the office will
be determined. Mr. Sheehan is firm in his
: stand that he will not surrender any of
i the patronage of his office to anybody.
j He affirms that this fight Is purely for
j patronage and that he will never surren
-1 der. He acknowledges that the Supervis
j ors have control of his department as to
j authorizing the employment of men, but
! he insists that he should be the one to
j determine how much assistance he re
quires.
Restraining Order Modified.
Judge Seawell made an order yesterday
modifying the restraining order hereto
fore made in the action of Oscar Moses
against the Board of Education et al.,
so far as the Board of Education is con
cerned, and the board is no longer prohib
ited or ordered to refrain from doing any
of the acts prohibited or mentioned in the
restraining order. Particularly the board
is no longer prohibited from approving
or ordering paid the claims of the teach
ers against the school fund of the city
and county for the amount of their sala
ries for the months of November and
December, 1898, and January. 1899. The
order modifying the restraining order
does not in any way assist the teachers
in collecting their salaries, however. It
was made simply on the ground that the
Board of Education was not a proper par
ty defendant in the action instituted
against Moses, and the court decided to
release the board from the obligations of
an injunction improperly placed upon it.

Laborers Want Their Pay.
John Gallagher, a laborer employed on
the Hall of Justice, has petitioned the
Board of Supervisors that his claim of
$74 50 be protected. He has been unable
to secure payment from either Bateman

their foreman. Thomas Fitzgerald filed
a similar claim for the sum of J167 70.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
â¢ NEW YORK, Feb. Stock prices receded
to-day with an average loss of 1 to 2 points,
which was exceeded in a number of Instances.
The ratification of the peace treaty induced j
purchases from London. There was less en- !
thusiasm locally and after an initial rise from j
fractions to a point and over In many cases
traders were free sellers in anticipation of a j
reaction. When It became evident that prices
were not holding, commission houses were free '
sellers. Prices receded rapidly in some In
stances and were presently at practically last
night's closing. The purchases for London
account, which were partly due to anticipating
the fortnightly settlements, together with cov
ering by the shorts, rallied the market. Wash
ington houses were large purchasers, while
Chicago houses sold. The market became
feverish and semi-stagnant. The constant
hammering by bear traders forced many stocks
to a point where liquidation was induced,
which made the lowest prices. There was
talk that most of the selling was in the in
terest of a bear clique, Bald to have been form
ed yesterday. The fact that the room traders
acted in unison was the only support found for
the story. From the highest there were re
actions from 2to 4 points. Among the weak
est features were General Electric, Tobacco,
Sugar, Metropolitan, Manhattan, Great North
ern preferred, Pennsylvania, the Pacifies, the
Grangers, the Readings and some minor indus
trials. The pressure against stock was mostly
professional and there was no unfavorable de
velopment In the news that attracted attention.
Considerable weakness was manifest ln cer
tain quarters of the bond market, but prices
Generally were lower in sympathy with stocks,

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 7.-The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The general tone of the markets here to-day
was steady but Inactive. The mining carry
over occupied the most attention. The rati
fication of the peace treaty caused Americans
to open buoyantly and carried them well above
parity. New York, however, sold heavily and
the close after hours was at the lowest. The
weakest features were Atchison preferred and
Northern Pacific common.

CHICAGO MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. 7.â The Liverpool wheat mar
ket was quite strong to begin with and the do- 1
mestlc receipts of wheat ln the Northwest'
were smaller than a year ago. For those reasons
smaller than a year. ago. For some reasons
the market here started firm at an Improve
ment of %c, with opening transactions ' for
May delivery at from 72%Â®72%. Shortly after
the opening New York reported the buying of
wheat there for foreign account and as there
was a good deal of anxiety among the local
- crowd concerning the condition of the winter
wheat crop owing, to* the continued - cold
| weather. May was bid up to 73c. Complaints
i of drought from California and India started
j shorts covering on a large scale, and as there
â¢ was considerable buying for the long account
' May hesitating around 72% c, rallied quickly
;to 73% c. Then profit- taking set In, and the
. price sagged off. to K72%c. ,- Bradstreet reported
an increase of 1,888,000 bushels In the world's
visible, â¢ and as that was very much under
the increase expected, the buying that fol
lowed this announcement put the price to 73% c.
The rally did not hold, .however, as some local
speculators j who had bought wheat yesterday
started to sell out on the bulge, an<T*"they
soon had so many Imitators that a - drop in
May wheat to 71%Â®71%c was the work of only
about half an hour. The closing price was
71%@72c. .
Business In corn was not very brisk or ex
tensive. The buying was of Indifferent char
acter and the market closed %c lower. There
was considerable selling by local traders in
oats, but an excellent demand from . outside
sources held prices steady. â  May closed un
changed.
Fewer hogs than expected, higher prices at
the yards and < large shipments of meats
strengthened provisions early. Later, how
ever, the market yielded with gains and heavy
selling by yesterday's buyers. * Pork lost 5c

THE PRUNE MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. 7â The Journal of Com-
merce says: Efforts to form a combination of
prune-growing Interests In _ way that will be
effective fcr upholding prices do not meet with
much sympathy from this end of the line. The
general impression here seems to be that It will
be impossible to effect a combination that can
control the market values, owing to the great
diversity of Interests represented and the Im
possibility of establishing standards of qual
ity that will be equally acceptable to seller
and buyer.

DRIED FRUITS, NUTS AND RAISINS. !
The market Is In decidedly better shape, and
stocks are being whittled down fine. Whereas
we carried over last year 100 cars of Apricots, j
150 cars of Peaches and 100 cars of Prunes,
making about 350 cars of fruit, dealers say
that from present indications not a single car
of any kind will be found on hand when the
new crop comes in. Already Pears and Necta
rines are practically cleaned up, stocks of Ap
ples are light and there are very few Peaches
left to work on. The trade says that the mar
ket will be in better shape next summer than
for years. The feeling is firm and Apples and
Peaches are in quick and improving demand
at advancing prices.
As for Prunes, the inherent strength of the
market is shown by the sale of twenty cars
of the Howard bankrupt stock in Chicago at
2%c, f. o. b., Santa Clara Valley. As
this is only - Vie i under the market It is
pretty good for a forced sale of bank
rupt stock. Supplies of this fruit are being
steadily reduced, and it is estimated that of
the 4000 cars produced by the three Pacific
States ln 1898 there are only about 600 left,
with six months yet to work on.

HIDES, TALLOW, WOOL AND HOPS,
Hides rule firm throughout the country at

A local firm says of Wool: "Eastern market
continues inactive and prices favor buyers.
After the brisk bidding and great strength
shown at the January London sales, where
prices advanced '"along the whole line, with all
offerings taken, it would seem that our domes
tic Wool should show more strength, both
in demand and In prices; but somehow i there
seems to be Indifference and lack of- demand,
which does not give encouragement to either
Wool grower or dealer for the incoming clip.
There is no local demand, except for. a 'good
thing' on free trade basis. The Wools now
here are quotably as low as they were in 1896."

THE STOCK MARKET.
There was quite a decline ln mining stocks,
as will be seen by the list of sales. ! The mar
ket was featureless. â Â«
Local securities were briskly dealt in, as
usual. Hawaiian Commercial - ran down to
$71 75. Contra Costa Water was stiff and ad
vanced to $68. ,
The Sulphur Bank Quicksilver Mining Com
pany has re-elected the old directors for 1599,
with Thomas Wlntrlngham as secretary. - The
mine is. not being worked at present.
The official report of General Manager Ross
of the Comstock Pumping Association for the
past week is as follows: The foundations at
the 1750 level of the C. and C. shaft have been
completed and the heaviest parts of the Rlsdon
pumping plant were safely lowered to that sta
tion.' The elevator and three sections of pres
sure and discharge pipe, a double . column 80
feet long, are now- being put together in the
shaft and will be lowered . into ' the water as
one section of the pumping plant. When this
part is in position â¢ and the connections are.
made the pressure column will be put in place'
rapidly and the work of Installation finished
as soon as possible.
The directors of the Consolidated California
and Virginia Mining Company yesterday
passed a resolution . authorizing Superintend
ent Kerwin to expend the money necessary to
extinguish the fire in . the old â  stopes between
the 1400 and 1650 levels of the mine and to do
the work ln such a way as will not Interfere
with the progress of the pumping operations
soon to begin. The repairs on j the 1400 level
north drift have already begun.

COMMITTEE NAMED TO CONFER
WITH LAWYERS.
Stockholders of the Defunct San Jose
Institution Are Refused a
Voice in the Pro
ceeding's.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Feb. 7.â Four hundred ex
cited depositors and shareholders in the
â¢ defunct Union Savings Bank scrambled
.;and fought for # a chance to participate
in the mass meeting of depositors in
: Hale's Hall this morning. The hall has
a seating capacity of about 200, but the
seats all were occupied long before 10
o'clock, the hour fixed in the call, and
the late comers were obliged to standâ
.that is, as many of them as managed to
â¢ , gain an entrance. The tactics of a col
. -lege football team were repeatedly
used to force a passage through the
dense throng at the entrance to the
.;. hall and several times affairs reached
: such- a stage that it looked as though a
riot was in progress.
â¢".â¢' Within the situation was about as
â  bad. The victims of the peculiar flnan
. ciering methods pursued by the officers
of the wrecked institution, who had aa
â¢-:sembled for the purpose of taking
; .measures to protect their interests by
:. .concert of action, were packed in the
m like sardines in a box, and the
discomfort thus entailed was aggra
. :vated by the efforts of those on the oiit-
Ye-ide to force their way into the room.
Fully a half-million in deposits was
:-. represented in the meeting, while a
./.'goodly number of stockholders were
: present, either in person or through
>. their, attorneys, a score of whom
watched the proceedings closely, but
: : ; jJooTt no part in the discussion.
.it was early evident that the depos
â i- termined to brook no out
... interference with any plans they
â .â â 'â jftiph; formulate fo secure a return of
â  thVir money. They were in the ma
.:.â¢â 'j'-nrity, and although the net result of
â¢â¢vthe- meeting was the appointment of a
-ering committee, which will consult
â ..-.with-, attorneys and report at to-mor
\-s, meeting, they promptly squelched
V-very attempt on the part of the stock
to sain recognition,
of the stockholders present
'.â 'were depositors also, and as such they
'â 'â  â  Wiii. be allowed tv take a hand in what
itlon may be determined upon,
â u-iugh they r Â» looked upon with a
tain degree of suspicion by those
whose sole interest in the bank lies in
their having their savings tied up by
tho failure.
Professor C. W. Childs was elected
chairman and C. L. Witten secretary.
\M hkinai this preliminary had been
Â«n.ded to and the chairman had
briefly stated the object of the meeting.
Cyrus Jones jumped to the fore and
"iirgz& the necessity of calmness in the
iberations. He said he was a stock
:<}er, but as such he had more at
ke than the depositors.
That was as ff as he got. A man in
.the- crowd shouted "Sit down," while a
ru.Â« of voices declared. "This is no
.stockholders' meeting," and Mr. Jones
got the remainder of the speech he
.hail come prepared to deliver.
some one shouted a motion that a
â¢ committee of seven be appointed by the
' chair -to consult an attorney as to the

proper course to pursue and report at
another meeting to-morrow.
Attorney W. F. James, who was pro
jected Into the hall at this moment at
the apex of a flying wedge, landed on
his feet in front of the chairman in
time to second the motion in a speech
that Bet the assembled depositors wild
with enthusiasm. He declared â¢ the
meeting -was a depositors' meeting and
stockholders should have no voice in
the proceedings, and wound up by of
fering an amendment providing that
only depositors should be eligible to
serve on the committee. The amend
ment was adopted with a whoop, and
then the young attorney nearly spoiled
the favorable impression he had made
by offering a second amendment. to the
effect that the holder of a depositor's
proxy be considered eligible tb serve.
A storm of protests arose, the feeling
being that a depositor who did not take
sufficient interest in the proceedings to
attend personally was not entitled to
any recognition. *
A proposal to gauge the vote by the
amount of the voter's deposit was
promptly voted down, Mr. Witten argu
ing that a small amount on deposit by
a poor man was more to him than that
of a man who had ten times as much.
Mr. Witten then made a misstep by
saying that a stockholder had as much
at stake as a depositor, and the ava
lanche of indignant protests which fol
lowed took away his breath.
SAN JOSE BANK FAILURE
DROVE HIM TO SUICIDE
E. E. Thomas, Prominent Fruit Packer,
Turned on the Gas and
Went Hence.
EDIA/ARD E. THOMAS.
EDWARD E. THOMAS, president of the E. E. Thomas Fruit Company of
San Jose, was found dead in bed yesterday forenoon in a lodging house
at 14 Turk street. The stopcock of the gas fixture was turned fully on
and the room was full of the suffocating fumes. The transom over the
door was closed, as was the window, and this condition gave rise to a be
lief that the dead man had committed suicide, but as the night was cold
it was natural that the windows and transom ; should be closed to exclude the
cold air.
The landlord Informed the Coroner that the gas was turned off at the meter
at 6 o'clock in the morning every day and not turned on again until even
ing. If this be true, Thomas could not have been killed by going to sleep with
the gas lighted. As he was known to have been impecunious and despondent re
cently, it is believed that he committed suicide.
Thomas came to this city from San Jose last Friday, as shown by the date
on a return railroad ticket. Last Monday night at 10 o'clock he engaged a 50
--cent room at 14 Turk street, and was shown to an apartment on the second floor
in the back part of the building. He Immediately retired and was not Been
again until his room had been forced open and his dead body found.
The dead man was also district agent and manager of the agencies of the
Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company of Milwaukee for the counties of
Santa Clara, San Benito, __onterey and Santa Cruz. He resided at the corner
of Race street and Luther avenue, San Jose.
Two pawn tickets found on lne person of the deceased show that he was in
financial straits. One ticket was for a diamond ring and pin, on which $52 was ad
vanced by the Baldwin Jewelry Company, and the other was for a gold Watch,
on which $21 had been advanced by the same firm, the date of the first ticket
being December 23 and that of the second January. 27.
The deceased was the president and practically the whole of the E. E.
Thomas Fruit Company. He was associated in that business with Mr. Howard,
whose name has been mentioned in connection with the recent failure of the Un
ion Bank in San Jose; Thomas supervising the handling, dipping and shipping
of the fruit, and Howard attending to the marketing of the same.
The mother of the deceased died .last October,. never having rallied from the
shock of the suicide a year before that time of a brother of Edward, who
hanged himself with a baling rope.
The widow of the deceased was apprised of the sad affair yesterday and she
had the body sent to San Jose for interment. She has a little girl three years
old. - 'â¢ ' -
. .. Mr. Mangrum of the firm of Mangium & Otter of this city and San Jose
visited the Morgue yesterday afternoon and. identified the body. *. He is married
to a sister of the deceased. He said that Edward was a temperate man, but
that he hail met wun financial reverses recently and had no doubt committed
suicide. What makes matters worse is the fact that the deceased allowed the
insurance on his life to lapse, last July by non-payment of the premium, and
this will leave his widow and daughter practically destitute, the . real estate
owned by him in Santa Clara County being mortgaged up to Its full value.
Thomas was a native of Ohio, 35 years old. _ .."*.'.
A dispatch to The Call from San JoÃe says: The suicide of E. E. Thomas,
of this city, who was -found dead in a San Francisco lodging house to-day, is
believed to be directly due to worry over the failure of the Union Savings
Bank. Mr. Thomas was a borrower at the bank, although the amount of his
indebtedness is not believed to be large. . ..
Thomas operated a large' fruit dryer, and had considerable business
dealings with E. B. Howard, I. fact, according ,to his attorney, Howard
owed Thomas about $9000, and this fact, together with the failure of the
bank, caused Thomas to become despondent. It is claimed that Thomas was
forced to do business with Howard by. the refusal of the bank to accommo
date him unless he did so.' As this is in line with the methods of the con- 1
cern, it is more likely to be true than not. * . ' x \.
Howard's attorney denies that his client was indebted to.Thomas, and
states that Howard holds a chattel mortgage against Thomas for **"5000. This
is secured by about double value of fruit. ' Thomas has been hard up for
funds for some time and has been dissipating pretty heavily. Deceased had
passed a number of worthless check*. 'on his friends, and fear of arrest may
have preyed on his mind until he resolved to kill himself.
Some years ago Thomas' father, . who was a prominent orchardist, died,
leaving deceased and his brother a snug fortune. Judd Thomas, his brother,
squandered his share and two years ago committed suicide by hanging. E.
E. Thomas was 34 years of age, and leaves a widow and one child. His rela
tives deny that he committed suicide and attribute his death to accident.

Finally, after more than an hour of
turmoil and confusion, the chairman
succeeded In gaining the attention of
the meeting long enough to announce
the names of those selected to serve
on the committee, as follows: S. F.
Moore of Gllroy, Homer Prindle, L.

E. C. Rodwick and C. W. Childs.
Shortly afterward the meeting ad
journed to meet to-morrow morning at
11 o'clock in Turn Verein Hall, which,
it is expected, will accommodate all
who apply for admission.
The committee conferred with a num
ber of attorneys this afternoon, but
while a number of plans were discussed
no definite action will be decided upon.
While many of the stockholders are ex
ceedingly bitter in their denunciations
of the bank officials and favor taking
steps to place them behind prison bars,
the conservative element is in the ma
jority, and no action will be taken
without the most careful consideration
of the consequences involved. It is be
lieved by some that the quickest ahd
most satisfactory course would be to
allow the appointment of a receiver, for
the bank and await the formal winding
up of the affairs of the defunct institu
tion, but the depositors as a class need
their money, and they will listen to no
plan which involves delay if It can be
shown that they can compel a settle

"ESCAPES HIS DESERTS
Bunkoed Judge Angellotti by Shed

SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 7.â Charles Harri
son, whom the State .authorities; admit
to be one of the cleverest crooks that ever
graced I the , interior of a penitentiary, was
released from confinement yesterday, and
has already^ made his escape from the
country, - though he is wanted for a bur
glary committed at Tiburon, a conviction
of which would mean a life ' sentence.
When " Superior Judge Angellotti. learned
that Harrison had vanished, I he was I con

"brick a few months ago, the memory of
which still rankles in. the judicial mind.
Harrison was arrested on a charge of
burglary last August for having entered
a house near California City and stolen a
quantity of provisions. When brought
before Judge Angellotti he manifested a
spirit of resignation and pleaded guilty.
"With trembling .lip and streaming tears
he related how he had gone without food
for two days - and ; had stolen provisions
only when half i famished. The heart of
the court : was touched at the man's evi
dent distress, and he imposed the light
sentence of seven months in San Quentin
prison.
- Many criticisms were passed by those
who attended court, and Judge Angellotti
afterward admitted he might have been
a little bit harsh. â¢ â â -â -. v.-
When Harrison reached San Quentin he
was recognized as one of the worst crim
inals on the Pacific Coast, a man who had
already graced a cell in this institution
no less than five times. His prior con
victions would have given him a life sen
tence. " '
District Attorney Mclsaacs telenhoned
Warden Hale â¢ to-day to find out when
Harrison was to be released, saying Dr.
B. F.Lyford. of -Tiburon. had s./orn to a

on Their Return From Beni
cia Barracks.

hundreds who had gathered from all parts
of the county. The Stars and Stripes, were
flying from every flagpole, and as they
marched down the streets, headed by the
remaining members of old Company B,
they were greeted with cheer after cheer
until the air fairly rang with one grand
chorus of voices going _p In welcome.
They were escorted to the Armory,
where they were addressed by Colonel R.
A. Gray, known as "the father of Com
pany B," and who is dear to the hearts
of every member of that grand old or
ganization. Then they were turned over
to the ladies of the. Red Cross, who had
prepared for them an elegant dinner. To

The Singular Case of
Hilma Lundquist.
DOCTOR SAYS DIPHTHERIA
PARENTS THINK IT WAS A
DEADLY POTION.
Infant Was in Good Health, but Died
Shortly After Swallowing the
Contents of a Bottle of
Cough Syrup.
;'â¢.â¢'â  -. ALAMEDA, Feb. The cause of death
of little Hilma Lundquist, the three-year
â '*. â¢* old daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A. A. Lund
'â¢';â¢ 'â¢â¢: * quist of 2105 Clement avenue, is a disputed
â¢'..' 'â¢â  question between the parents and the at
â¢:*â¢*.'. tending physician. Dr. Alfred Sander.
The child died on the morning of Janu
'.-â¢ 7 ary 30 after an illness lasting but a few
hours. The death certificate states that
It was a case of diphtheria, and the doc
tor says it was of the most virulent type.
The parents express the belief that their
child was accidentally poisoned. A snort |
time before she was taken ill Hilma got j
hold of a bottle half filled with a cough
mixture and drank the contents. The par
ents think that the medicine contained
opiates or other poisonous drugs in suf
ficient quantity to cause death.
Within a few minutes after taking the 'â 
..'-'...' dose the little one went into convulsions
* \. . and exhibited all the symptoms of pols
.'.. bning. Dr. Sanders was sent for. but be- I
. .fore the messenger reached him Hilma
._â¢-..*'*'â¢ showed signs of reviving and word was i
;â '=. .' sent to the doctor that his services were j
V: â¢ not required. Some hours later the par
â¢".' eats became alarmed at the condition of
.'the child and the physician was once ;
more summoned. He pronounced the case '
one of diphtheria, and, although he re
sorted to every remedy known to his pro
fession to save the little one's life, it died
.within five hours.
Up to the time of taking the cough
* â¢ mixture the child had been enjoying com
paratively good health. It had been play
ing with the children of the neighborhood J
: within a few minutes of the time It was |
'. taken ill.

W. A. BRANDES
NOW ON TRIAL
FOR HIS LIFE
For the Cruel Murder
of His Daughter.
FIVE JURORS ARE ACCEPTED
CHALLENGES OF THE JURY
PANEL ARE DENIED.
Defense Still Hopes to Prove by Ex
pert Testimony That the
Girl Was Not Mur
dered.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
y 90S Broadway, Feb. 7.
The trial of William A. Brandes,
, charged with having beaten to death his
13-year-old daughter, Lillian, on Novem
ber 19, 1898, was begun ln Judge Hall's
court this morning and the entire day
was occupied in selecting five jurors. The
trial of Mrs. Etta Brandes on the same
charge was continued one week.
Attorney. Sawyer, on behalf of the de
fense, attempted to force a stay of pro
. ceedings by formally challenging the jury
; i panel on the ground that it was irregu
larly drawn for the following reasons:
I That the court in January, 1898, desig
nated 450 men to serve as jurors for the
ensuing year. The law stated that the i
! selection from this number must be made
i by the Board of Supervisors immediately. I
This was not done until March. Secondly, !
i that there had been excused without
; cause nearly 150 jurors, and Sawyer
wished his client to have the privilege of :
! drawing from that number; and finally, i
i that on January 23. 1599, 250 more Jurors j
were selected by the court, and Sawyer
wanted the privilege to draw one from
these.
Judge Hall overruled these objections
and the impaneling of the jury, which
followed, progressed so slowly that when
court adjourned but five jurors were ac
cepted and sworn. These are G. W. Gor
don, rancher; W. T. Gibbs. stationer;
Charles Bock, carriage builder; E. S.
Marston, retired merchant; and A. Jonas,
merchant.
The full panel was exhausted and a
special venire ordered of forty names, re
turnable at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.
Before Judge Hall had so ordered, how
ever. Attorney Sawyer asked that the
names be taken from the 150 excused dur- :
ing the year, basing such request upon '
| a Supreme Court decision. Judge Hall, ;
j nevertheless, ordered that the selection i
be made by regular venire.
Judging from the questions asked of '
i jurors, it would be difficult to assert just ;
i what the defense will be, unless it be that
! by expert testimony of physicians and \
'â  surgeons an effort 'will be made to prove !
that the death of Lillian Brandes was not
due to the beating and blows upon her
head.
During the impaneling of the jury ;
the accused murderer and murderess and
a little son sat beside their attorneys, ;
seemingly in good health. Brandes wore '
a brown suit, dark blue woolen shirt and i
white four-in-hand tie. Mrs. Brandes j
was muffled In a black cloth Jacket and '
I had on a light fedora hat with crepe band j
j and black veil. The accused couple |
scrutinized very seriously the faces of the
j jurors, as if to determine thereby whatâ I
if anyâ sentiment they might have.
It is expected the trial will occupy at !
i least two weeks.
JEALOUSY NEARLY
CAUSES A TRAGEDY
THOMAS JONES BRANDISHES A
GUN EXCITEDLY.
A. P. Murdoff Was Talking to Mrs.
Jones and Her Husband Be
came Suspicious.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 7.
A shooting scrape was very narrowly
averted at the Juanita House on San
Pablo avenue this afternoon, and as a
sequel Thomas Jones, an ironmolder, is
the occupant of a cell at the City Prison,
charged with an attempt to murder A. F.
Murdoff.
Both men have been stopping at the
Juanita for some time past, and, from all
accounts, Murdoff was in the dining-room
this afternoon, engaged in a friendly con
versation with Mrs. Jones, when her hus
band entered.
Enraged over finding his wife and Mur
doff talking, Jones ordered his spouse to
leave the room. He then reached to his
hip pocket and whipped out a six-shooter.
In the encounter that ensued he was pre
| vented from using the weapon with effect,
; and it was finally secured by a third per-
I son.
Sergeant Peterson was summoned, and
placed Jones under arrest. Murdoff pro- I
tests that he was doing nothing that I
might have aroused Jones' jealousy. He
says he was simply talking with Mrs.
Jones upon a matter of business regarding '
a mine in which he is Interested. He in- i
sists that there was no cause for Jones'
alleged attempt to murder him.
Jones' ball was fixed by Police Judge i
Smith at $2500 cash or $5000 bonds
Jones, when seen at the City Prison !
was very reticent. He said he did not I
care to make any statement for publica- i
tion, but admitted that he had had '
trouble with Murdoff heretofore. He was
formerly interested In the Oakland Iron I
Works, and Is well advanced In years. I
He Intimated that he must have been out I
of his mind when he pulled his revolver
He recently returned from Denver,
whither he had gone in the hope of re- j
covering from asthma.

The campaign in the Fifth Ward is one
of extraordinary Interest. This ward is
referred to as the "kid glove" ward, the
aristocratic ward, among politicians, and
contains* less of the working class than
any other ward In the city. Mr. Wood
ward has evidently presumed on this con
dition, and has induced himself to be
come a candidate for the Council. This
condition was emphasized strongly last
night at the Populist convention. There
was not a single delegate from the Fifth
Ward on the floor, and the chairman an
nounced that there were evidently no
Populists in that high-toned district.
There can be no doubt, however, that
the next Councilman from the Fifth Ward
will be Felton Taylor, who has been nomi
nated by the Republicans, the Municipal
League and the Independents.
The Fifth Ward is expecting much sub
stantial aid from the city at large for
the carrying out of certain Improvements
around Lake Merritt, and It certainly can
not dare to offer such an affront to the
remaining six wards as to elect a Coun
cilman who behaved as Woodward did
last spring. Whatever Woodward's faults
may be. his judgment is certainly not* of
the kind that makes faithful Councilmen.
The Independent Republicans are plan
ning for a very busy campaign. They will
hold meetings in every ward as well as in
the annexed district, and ex-Mayor Da
vie has declared his intention of being as
aggressive as he was four years ago.
To-morrow evening the Republican City
Central Committee will meet to consider
the work of the campaign, which will
probably be started by a big mass meet
ing some time next week in the heart of
the city. â '-â vy.v.
The executive committee of the Munici
pal League met to-night and Indorsed
George R. Stetson, the Republican nomi
nee for Councilman at large, to fill the
vacancy created on the league ticket by
the resignation of C. A. Chichester.

Comb became violent at her home. She
started in demolishing all the dishes In

badly. The demented woman was finally
overpowered, and Berkeley Marshal
Lloyd was summoned and took charge of
her. This morning she again became vio
lent and it was then decided to have her
examined. Her loss of reason is attrib
uted, to the fact that she has been ill for
some time. , â  .

A NEWSPAPER CLIPPING
Nearly $5000 a front foot Ib a pretty good
price for residence property on Fifth aye. at |
Seventy-second st. This is opposite Central !
Park, and is now regarded as the choicest
residence location in the city. Twenty-flve
years ago it was almost unimproved and
could have been bought for about the same
price as the best residence property in this
city commands to-day."
The above clipping is from the Chronicle.
It certainly shows that If this city grows in
population lots near Golden Gate Park will
; i become valuable. Lots can be had there now
at a very low price and on easy termsâ say
$10 or $11 a front foot*
Will it not pay you to look Into this ques-
tion?
, We have lots on Bth, 9th, 10th and Hth
ayes.. not far from the park, for $275; $25
cash. $5 monthly; graded and ready for the
.builder.
See them to-day; take a pleasant ride on
the -new electric cars running to the Cliff
House (Haight, Eddy and Ellis st. cars trans-
fer); get off at H st. and Ninth aye.; we
have a branch office on the corner, where you

were served on Auditor Wells yesterday
by Georgia C. Morse by her attorney,
Warren Olney Jr. She avers in her com
plaint that she is a regularly elected
teacher in the Webster Primary School,
and on June 28, 1898, the Board of Educa
tion fixed her salary at $76 90 per month
for the ensuing year beginning July 1.
1898. and ending June 30, 1899. and that
during January last she performed all her
duties and presented her demand for that
month's salary for $63 20. there having
been deducted 20 per cent by order of the
Board of Education. The case will be
heard before Judge Dalngerfleld Febru

Regarding the November-December sal
ary accounts different figures have been
given, but the following are the correct
amounts as furnished by Auditor Wells:
Novemberâ Teachers, $58,*09 80; janitors. $5023;

for two months, $191, 10.
While the overpaid salary was stated by
Judge Seawell to be $123,500. according to
Mr. Wells' figures it is only about $113,
--412, which under the court's ruling brings
the teachers' indebtedness down about
$10,000. .. .7;.-..\- -:

WALTER S. HINKLE
FOUND DEAD IN BED
The Ex= Assistant District Attorney the
Victim of Asphyxiation by Inhaling
Illuminating Gas in His Sleep.
WALTER S. HINKLE, ex-Assistant District Attorney, was found dead in bed yesterday morning -. in : . his
residence, 2409 Webster street. He had been asphyxiated by illuminating gas. As the lower sash of the
window had been raised by the deceased before he -went to sleep, and. as the stopcock of the gas fixture
was quite loose and partly turned on, allowing the deadly fluid to escape, the inference Is that he turned
the stopcock carelessly and turned on the gas without knowing it. Dr. Charles Cross was called in as soon
as the body was found, and after an unsuccessful effort to resuscitate the deceased he informed Coroner Hill.
The Coroner, in deference to the wishes of Mr. Hinkle's wife, allowed the corpse to remain Where it was, and,
hastily summoning a jury, held an inquest at the residence, the jury rendering a verdict to the effect that death
was accidental.' 7-- - --v^'vy//\. - : y'v77y : ''yyyy~y.y
Mrs. Hinkle said that her husband was used to sleeping in the room, in which he was found dead/while she
and her little boy and girl occupied another apartment. She heard a slight noise in her husband's apartment soon
after he retired, but she thought, nothing. of it and had no suspicion that anything was wrong until she entered
his room yesterday morning to. call him to breakfast. , /7/7//8777:.
Mr. Hinkle was 37 years old and was a native of Petaluma. in this State. He studied; law and entered the
law office of General W. H. L. Barnes, and it was there that >he made the acquaintance of the general's son,
W. S. Barnes. When the latter was elected District Attorney he appointed Mr. Hinkle as Assistant District At
torney. In that capacity the deceased prosecuted many ; important cases, and with marked ability.
During the trial of M. B. Curtis, otherwise Sam'l of Posen, the aclor, for the murder of a policeman, Mr.
Hinkle became acquainted with Miss Beatrice Moses, who was reporting the trial for the Chronicle. | They were
married soon afterward and two bright little children were the result of the unionâ a boy of 6 and a girl of
4 years. A sister of the deceased is the wife of Bert Morrow, a son of United States Circuit Judge Morrow.
A STERN PARENT.
W. H. Nolan, a Teamster, Would
Send His Sort to Prison.
W. H. Nolan has met defeat in his sec
ond attempt to send hie son, Francis L.
Nolan, to Whittier Reform School. For
some reason, apparently unaccountable,
Nolan wishes the State to care for his
offspring, and has retained counsel to fur
ther his ends. '. y' .-7!7*V : â¢-'.; 7' : "7 -7Â» *â â "*':
Yesterday a petition for the commit
ment of young Nolan, signed by hie
father, was taken up by Judge Dunne.
Nolan Sr. endeavored to prove that â¢ his
son^as of a vicious nature,' quarrelsome
and a worshiper at the shrine of Bacchus.
The proof failed and the contention on be
half of the defendant that* ' the . only
vicious trait he ever manifested was an
honorable desire to keep his father from
marrying his housekeeper two months
after his wife died was established. Judge
Dunne then refused to hear any more tes
timony on the case and ordered the pris
oner discharged.
The fond parent's counsel immediately
noted exceptions to all the rulings of the
court and the case will be carried to the
Supreme Court by the father who would
send his son to prison.
As young Nolan proved that he has
worked for a living since he was 14 years
of age, has never been arrested for or
suspected of crime, Judge Dunne thought
that sending him to prison would be an
outrage, and though it disappointed the
anxious parent the court released the
prisoner. In a few days the Supreme
Court, it is thought, will be burdened with
the father's bitter tale of his son's "evil
ways," but as the trial court" Is the best
judge of the honesty of witnesses :it is
hardly likely that the higher tribunal will
interfere with Judge Dunne's ruling.
A BRUTAL BRICKLAYER.
J. A. Konkle Convicted of Beating
His Four-Month-Old Child.
J. A. Konkle, a bricklayer living. at 232
Minna street, was convicted by Acting
Police Judge Barry yesterday of brutally
beating his four-months-old child. He will
be sentenced to-day.
Mrs. Caroline McCarthy, j the owner of
the house where Konkle and his family
lived/testified to hearing the child scream,
and when she entered the house she saw
the child on the mother's lap -and the
father was beating it with his fists. The
father said that the child cried so much
that , he would choke it <to death. The
house, was in a filthy condition, and a
two-year-old boy was wallowing in filth.
Both father and mother were under : the
influence of liquor.
Judge Barry severely censured . Konkle
for his inhuman conduct, and intimated
that when he appeared for sentence he
would give him the limit. Mrs. Konkle
has been taken care of by Sister Julia.

The Fatjo Hotel Vis

DAMAGE WILL REACH $5000
HOT ASHES IN A BARREL THE
CAUSE OF THE BLAZE.
Â»
A Dance in the Next Building Was
Interrupted for a Moment, but .
the Piddles Played While
the Building Burned.
Fire broke out in the Fatjo . Hotel, at
the corner of Polk and Bush streets,
shortly before 8 o'clock last evening and
before the flames were subdued, about
$5000 damage was done .to the building
and contents. . 7 .1
The blaze was first discovered by peo
ple on the street, who observed flames
bursting through the roof of the building.
The alarm was turned in by Fred O'Brien,
a newspaper man, and the department re
sponded quickly, but it was some time
before a stream could be put on the fire.
It looked for a time as if the entire build
ing would be consumed,. as it is a wooden
structure, but when the firemen got tc
work ; the fire was : quickly controlled.
As the hotel was "* tilled with lodgers
there was considerable excitement when
the flames were discovered. Fully forty
people were in the - place when the Are
broke out, but all escaped without in-
Jury. A dance was in progress next door
to the hotel and when the flamed burst
through the roof the dance hall was light
ed up and those making, merry supposed
that the building in which they were
was on fire, and there was a wild scramble
for the. door. After it was learned that
the dance hall was in no danger, the
guests returned and the dancing con
tinued while the hotel burned. ,
Just how the fire started is not known.
It was; thought at first that it started in
the kitchen of the j hotel, but Captain
Comstock believes it originated on the
stairway In the rear of the hotel and was
caused by hot ashes in a, barrel. The
flames ate their way up the stairs to the
top story," bursting through the. roof.
â¢ Nearly * every room ;- in . the - house was
damaged by fire, water and smoke and
the loss to the contents will probably
reach $2000, while that to the building will
exceed $1500. The A. H. Smith Drug Com
pany, Irvine Brothers' grocery and A,
Huber's confectionery, on the first floor of
the building," were all damaged by water
and their Toss will . bring the total loss
from the blaze up to $5000. This is only
partially covered by insurance.
JOHN FOUGA . PROMOTED.
The Popular. Assistant Clerk of the
ttnite d States ; District" Court
Is Made a ; Deputy.
John Fouga, the popular clerk in the
office of United States " District .; Clerk
George E. Morse, was promoted yesterday
by United States District; Judge de Haven
to the position of Deputy, Clerk. The pro
motion was : made on [ the suggestion and
recommendation of Mr. Morse, and in pro
nouncing sentenceâ or rather in making
the appointment, the court complimented
Mr. Fouga on the thorough 'and conscien
tious manner in which: he had performed
the duties of his office. -
[ :- Mr. Fouga has been ln the office for the
past twelve years, and he and Deputy-
Clerk Manley, by reason of their long
experience and knowledge of the work en
trusted to them, have become almost In
dispensable. The large increase of Chi
nese immigration cases during the past
two years, and the passage of the Fed
eral bankruptcy law, have added largely
to the work of the office. .The aDpoint
ment of Mr. Fouga as a deputy authorizes
him to sign papers as such and greatly
expedites and facilitates the business of
the office.
