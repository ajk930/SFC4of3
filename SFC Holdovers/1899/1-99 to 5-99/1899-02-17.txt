; It is believed at the War De
partment that there are complica
tions in the Philippine situation.
This belief is based on the latest
reports/ from General Otis, who
intimates that he will not pursue
..an aggressive campaign until re
inforcements reach him.
â  General Miller is supposed to
have sent an expedition against
Cebu,. the third city in size and
importance in the Philippine
group and. the capital of the
island of the same name. The
department officials expect to
hear at any time that Cebu is in
possession of the American
forces, but it is impossible to pre
dict whether or not the fall of the
city will be preceded by a battle.
Oil top of all this
comes the informa
tion that Aguinaldo
lias expressed a will
ingness to call the
insurgents off for a
cash consideration.
33Aone of the officials of the :
State or War Departments have
receive d any formal notification
d_*:_h"<_- desire of the rebel chief to
3 â3a!i â himself at 3 the "expense of
this Government and of the mis
guided Tagallos who are serving
under his farce-comedy govern
ment/ but in view of the previous
record of the "President of the
Philippine Republic" the states
ment is looked upon as more than
probable.
, His; selling put to Spain and his
;sub sequent .treachery are too well
remembered, however, by this
Gov.ernrr.ent, and there is not the
slightest probability that his
proposition will be entertained.
fi .It is said at the War Depart
ment that the plan of General
Otis is now decided. He has no
immediate object in extending
his front, which already covers
twenty-five miles. Probably this
would be impracticable against
European troops, but it is safe
enough in the case of the Fili
pinos. The 'latter-, would never
have shown the courage and en
durance they have if they had not
been misled as to the fighting
qualities" of the Americans. It
would be folly to drive the scat
tered native army into the jungles
and hills until Otis has reinforce
ments enough to prevent surprise
at any point on his long front.
War Department officials be
lieve' it is his intention to allow
the Filipinos to mass where they
will ; ' and then to strike and dis- i
perse them. 3y Every time he hits
they become less determined ii j
their resistance;. .Our troops now
hold Manila and its suburbs, in
cluding many villages in the
Island of Luzon, Iloilo. and a
number of hamlets in the Islands
of Panay, and General Miller has
probably captured or will soon
capture. 0 Celiu:.-3 These .are the

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 16.â At one stage in a
career- of repulsive conduct which has
been the open scandal of the Senate
during this session of the Legislature
Senator C. M. Simpson of Pasadena to
day cast his vote for Daniel M. Burns
for United States- Senator.
... He, did not act as a man in his sober
senses, impelled by an * honest motive,
would have acted. Such a man would
have - consulted * Melick and his col
leagues from | Los Angeles, who are
bound with himself to Bulla by a
pledge that cannot be broken honor
ably." He has broken "it dishonorably
and against the wishes of a constitu
ency which he has betrayed.
- Had the respectable and honor-loving
people of California witnessed the dem
onstration in the Assembly chamber, in
which all the low and despicable ele
ments clustering about the 3 Capitol
participated, they would have blushed
for the fair, commonwealth. .
.Simpson, in spite of his vicious .tastes,
low surroundings * . and 3 obvious weak
nesses, maintained, = until to-day, the
outward .respect- of many of his fellow
men, but since his disgrace wag pub
licly, proclaimed in joint convention hid
old companions, and friends regard him
as an object to be pitied and despised.
At his home in Pasadena.. Senator
Simpson poses as the exponent of the
moral and prohibition elements of so
ciety. He shudders at the thought of
men becoming intoxicated. He is the
champion of the observance of the Sab
bath, and introduces in the Legislature
the petitions and bills for a more rigid
observance of the Lord's day. He re
ceived his nomination for the Senate
because his opponent, . George Phipps.
had the reputation of looking on the
wine when it is red. The moral people
of Pasadena supported Simpson on the
ground that .he was a man â¢ fitted by
his conduct in life to give expression
to their advanced ideas of morality.
Early in this. session of the Legisla
ture Simpson got into bad company.
The society of depraved touts seemed
agreeable to him. ...Step by step he went
from bad to worse until his presence
in the Senate Chamber became a re
proach to the honorable body.
' If the people of Los Angeles County
for a minute doubt the truth of this
statement of The Call let them send
to Sacramento a committee of Senator
Simpson's neighbors to investigate it.
Should these neighbors come here and
make fair inquiry they would ascertain
that Simpson, before breaking his sol
emn pledge to stand by Mr. Bulla, went
to General ' Barnes and promised the
general that whenever he left Bulla he
would go to Barnes and stay there un
til the finish,' They will find that he
made a like promise to support Grant.
They would ascertain further that the
"moral", Senator representing the Pas
adena * constituency Â« has been boasting:
of I his - own vices and sounding the
shame of his | own debauches.
When the joint convention of s the
Legislature adjourned to-day Simpson
was immediately surrounded and con
gratulated by the, swarms of touts now
infesting the Capitol. The people of
Pasadena should have seen * the gang
that commended their Senator. Never
before was such > a disgrace cast upon
a constituency of honest people as that
which Simpson to-day inflicted upon
the - good', people j of , Pasadena^ . â¢ 3 ' 7
i- In one ' sense the j Senator is not , re
sponsible for c his conduct, as he , has
seldom been sober since the Legislature
convened. * The touts knew his weak
ness and ministered to it. They did
not permit him . to get sufficiently
! sober -to enable . him to j judge between
! right and wrong. He is now landed
â  in the Burns corral and herded with
! Wright and ; Jilson. His public career
i closes in disgrace.
, The fact has been known for weeks
that he intended to desert the stan
dard "of Mr. Bulla, but: Burns ex
pected: to shield him under cover of a
secret caucus. The caucus scheme,
however, has failed, arid the "colonel"
is now forced to the cruel extremity of
dragging his 'followers; out in the open
light of the joint Assembly.
: Several others may, be dragged out
in" like fashion, but the end has come
for the Caridelaria candidate. I The
! Simpson episode gives -cohesion to the
i anti-Burns .elements. â Public judgment
j expressed in every county of the State
I may now demand a consolidation of all
! the elements of the Legislature opposed
j to the election of Burns.

by the touts that all the followers of
Senator Bu.la, -save one, belong to the
railroad and that they will go into the

Pandemonium broke loose on the Assembly floor at
noon to-day when Senator G. M. Simpson of Los Angeles
clutched his desk with both hands and : . -staggered to his un
certain feet to cast the vote that marked him as one of Dan
Burns* own/ -The uproar of a hundred of 3 the Mexican's
hired claquers was drowned in the howl of execration that;
went up from the decent members, of the House when the
..senile old man. 'from; the South attempted to make the ex
planation, that even in his inebriety;, he knew was due as a
last sop thrown to his respectability.
*' *"I want to explain " he persisted, but Senator Ashe '
.from the other side of the House shouted .that/while a roll
call was being taken an explanation was not in order. Again
he made an attempt^ and Melick, one of those whom he had

explain he did.
j- "I wanted to say when I was interrupted," mouthed
'.he, "that I cast my vote for the man I vote for because he is
' the grandest Republican the State ever saw."
Then again he subsided to the ringing beer-laden
cheers, of the odious Burns push that monopolized every
corner of the chamber. A second ballot was taken, but no
further changes were recorded
â¢The vote was as follows: â¢'.

for the boast, but if all of Bulla's men
should go to Burns the "colonel" would
still -.be; twenty votes short of the num
ber required to elect him: The com
bined , efforts of all the forces behind
Burps were employed for one month to
make this single advance of one vote.
The methods employed to obtain the
vote Intensify the bitterness of the con
test. A public revelation has been made
of the fact that there are no depths in
the poo. of corruption that will not be
fathomed to. defeat the will of the peo
ple at the dictation of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company. y " *
â¢ The joy in the Burns corral over the
presence.-.of Simpson is subsiding. The. j
touts were elated just after the ad- i
journment -of ; the joint convention, but:
later In the 'day they discovered that
the poor' old Senator who had betrayed j
his people was likely to become an
other Wright. To-night Simpson is a f
maudlin and pitiable sight. When
Bulla's friends seek to interview him
he breaks down and says with tears ,
in his eyes that he would be a thousand j
times glad to go back to Bulla's sup- !
port If there were any chance . of his
election.
Early : this â  morning Senator Simp
eon's wife begged him not to desert
Mr. Bulla, but he. insisted that he was
making a sacrifice Of his friendships
and feelings for the sake of the Repub
lican party. Later : on, while talking
with a friend of Senator " Bulla. Simp
son spoke with tears in his eyes of the
affection for. his colleague. He said* the
step he was about to take deeply
pained him.. * . 3 - .
.In. the Bulla camp to-night there is
a feeling of relief , that Simpson is out
of the way and in the Burns corral.
Bulla's supporters eel now that the
finger of scorn will; be no longer point
ed at them. y3.W" 77.- '*. \.-3 3;'-
Simpson's conduct for several weeks
has been, in a sense, regarded. as a re
proach to his associates. There is a
feeling of deep regret, however, that
Senator Currier had to start for his
home in Spadra, near Los Angeles,; this
evening. When he left here he had a
very high fever, with other indications
of a prolonged spell of the grip. :" He
will be absent* from the Senate for sev
eral days and unless reinforcements ar
rive the Bulla vote to-morrow will not
exceed eleven.
The proposed minority caucus this
evening was a failure. This will prob
ably end the caucus overtures of â¢ the
session. The battle henceforth will be
fought on the floor of the joint con
vention. Since, the betrayal of . South
ern California by . Simpson to-day the !
storm of indignation in that -region of j
the State may arouse the whole. people
to a realizing' sense of the --situation
here. \ "' '." 77 â¢7-i ' _ * r '"'. 73- \ '"-.' '.-.-'
-'General Barnes' supporters have, by
common consent,, resolved to keep out.
of all caucus 'schemes hereafter pro
posed. When the general was asked to
night If he proposed to 'enter a* caucus,
he referred the subject to a large; cir
cle of his supporters; then at his head
quarters, and, without a dissenting
voice they pronounced against further
participation in a caucus or council.
There was no caucus this afternoon.
A few members 'belonging to. the Bulla
camp and one of .the Barnes men as
sembled. A paper was ' presented by"
Assemblyman Melick, but It was so.
palpably unfair to. the supporters of
General Barnes that the friends of Mr.
Bulla would not ask the council to in
dorse it. An adjournment was * taken
until to-morrov evening, but there are
no I indications' that the. minority con
ference, will take place, at that time.
The Grant men are as firm in their pur
pose as ever to stand together as long
as Burns is a candidate. There is only
one way to break the deadlock arid that
ls by the elimination of Burns and
Grant from the contest.
There are several s stories floating
around to-night. concerning the con
sideration for Simpson's betrayal of his
people. One story is to : the effect that
he is to be rewarded with "a foreign
Consulship in the event of Burns' elec
tion. This Is regarded as 3 probable
since Simpson will not care to reside in*
California. *.
Co nel IP. Jackson/Collector of
the Port, expressed the opinion to-night
that Simpson's acquisition to the Burns
forces would; prove disastrous to Dan's
campaign for;. > the Senatorship. The
change is one that* will increase'popu
lar resentment; against the aspirations
of the Candelaria.: candidate. * Burns
gained nothing by crucifying Howard
E. Wright, and nothing will be gained
by acquiring the support of the Pasa
dena Senator. = Simpson is on the verge
of a mental and physical break-down,
and. if great..: car e .'is. not exercised in
handling him and, stimulating him in
the right degree he will not be able to
attend the sessions of the Legislature.
In the. joint convention to-day the
Grant men galled down the Burns touts
in good style. It was observed that the
touts wanted an Immediate adjourn
ment after the .result of the first ballot
recording the Simpson gain wag an
nounced. -
-The. obvious .design./- of j adjournment
was to leave the impression that other
changes were; in : reserve.. which would
be recorded, on the next ballot Friday
noon. The Grant mien saw the. point
and i resisted \ the motion to adjourn, so
that another ballot could be had then
and there. The motion to adjourn was
defeated and another ballot followed.
The Burns men were unable to make
another advance. In fact, they were in
a state of alarm lest a stampede to
Grant .or Barnes might be inaugurated.

before the last five or six. sessions, but
never before has it been allowed. . The
claim is for a percentage on about $300,

â¢ , eral Government on claims arising from
| the Civil War. He was authorized to do
I the work by a joint resolution of the

under the signature of the Governor, and
therefore it was declared that he was pro

' not collect his commission.

Appropriation.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 16.â bill for the appro
priation of $500,000 for the great exposi
tion has progressed as far as. the Finance
Committee of the Senate. It came before
that committee, this evening just after
the adjournment of the Senate. 3
. Charles L. Patton was present, to ex
plain and to support the measure and the
committee gave the matter most careful
attention." It was. -favorably considered,
but there was some fault found with the
language of the bill and the legal element
of the committee wanted to amend it so
as ' to- make .more , direct -and apparent
just who was to handle. the funds.of the
exposition.
The bill as drawn up was fashioned
on the lines of the measure providing an
appropriation for the California exhibit
at the World's Fair at Chicago. It was
considered that a close adherence to that
measure would be the safest course to
pursue, for there was no trouble with that
appropriation. The promoters of the Pa
cific Exposition expected no trouble with
this one. There was objection, however,
and the duties of the. commission of fif
teen will be even more clearly defined
than they are in the present measure, and
it will be made more evident just what
power and duties the commission will
have. It Is only a question of amendment
and it will not delay the bill more than a
day. It will then be reported back to the
Senate with the favorable, recommenda
tions of the committee.
--â¢Only the bill appropriating the State
money. was considered by the committee
The One providing for county appropria
tions was not taken up nor Is it the inten
tion of the committee to do so until the
appropriation .bill has been made ready
for passage by the Senate.
The county appropriation bill was taken
up by the Assembly Committee on Muni
cipal â¢ Corporations, however, this after
noon and without a dissenting vote was
reported back to the Assembly with fa
vorable recommendation, .
The. members of the committee are As
semblymen Raw, Dibble, Merrill,' Barry
Bliss, Mead and Meserve. There was com
paratively no discussion, as those gentle
men had made up their minds that the ex
position would be of infinite benefit to the
counties which they represent as well as
the immediate vicinity of San Francisco.
Such was the substance of the . remarks
made by them when the matter came up
for discussion. â¢

War to the Last Extremity Is De
clared on the Mexican.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Feb: 16.â An impor
: tant meeting of" the leaders of the Senatorial candidacy of U.S. Grant
was held in the rooms of the San Djegan this evening. ..During' the
past two days the steering committee appointed some days ago has
been at work among" the Grant men and the" supporters of candidates
other than *â¢ Dan Burns. The result of this work has been an unwrit- |
ten agreement among a large majority of the Republican Senators
and Assemblymen that they will never consent to go into a general
Senatorial caucus as long as Burns is a factor, in the Senatorial con
test. This fact was made clear at the .meeting to-night, and -Mr.
Grant was given positive assurances that with one or two exceptions
the men who are now voting for him. will, refuse ; : now and for all
time to go into any caucus or conference 'that has for . its object the
: discussion of the . Senatorial question if the supporters of Dan Burns
are allowed to participate.
"No one need fear that there will ever 7 be *â â¢.;_*.' Senatorial caucus
as long as Burns is in .the fight," said .Senator Cutter after the
meeting in Grant's," quarters. "Burns and his supporters are turning
themselves inside out in an effort to get a caucus because, they re- 3;
alize that in a caucus lies Burns' only hope of election: But they
are wasting their time, for none of the supporters of Mr. Grant will
ever go into a caucus, and without them none can be held. Besides
our own men there are twenty-five or thirty; others. who will refuse
to caucus on the Senatorial question as long as Burns is a -factor
,in the. fight. Burns will never get a caucus and he. will never be
elected United States Senator. That is as certain as that the sun
will rise to-morrow morning." 'Â-â â  â â 'â  . â¢
under the present regulations, and Major
Harney, whose term -has yet two years
to run. Dickinson's first bill provided for
a Harbor Commission of ; five, to be ap
pointed by the Governor,. and because it
made the terms of Herold and Harney
most uncertain quantities, as they are not
Republicans, the bill met with a good deal
of opposition, and its author had to be
satisfied with an adverse recommendation
from the committee. It is now before the
Senate in that shape. The substitute will
provide that there shall be three more
Commissioners appointed with the two
whose terms have still to run two and
three years. Another provision of im
portance-is one placing absolutely in the
hands of the commission the power of ap
pointment and removal of all employes.
At present the board has that power over
all but the collectors, who can only be re
moved for cause, but under the new bill
the board will have power over them all.

NO CHANCE FOR THE

to discourage him. !He has now .pro
posed practically the same measure as an
amendment to the river and harbor bill
The prevailing, belief now is that the
projei; will be carried over to the next
Congress.. The House Republican leaders
are -.early all known to be very much
opposed to the canal because of the large
am ant of money it will take out of the
tre^ury, and Speaker Reed does hot con

BIDS DEFIANCE TO
PUBLIC SENTIMENT
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 16 âThe an
nouncement ; that* Senator Simpson of
Pasadena has deserted Bulla and
Joined the forces of Dan Burns has
caused a great sensation In political
circles and among the friends of Sena
tor Simpson. - '! 7-\77
Â. The rumor that Simpson would de
sert Bulla spread around . town quickly
this morning. Many believed the ru
trior had been: engineered for an object
and that it had no real . foundation In
fact. Senator Simpson, however, In
telegrams put at rest all doubts on the
matter by admitting that the rumor
was correct and that he Intended to
cast his vote to-day for Colonel Burns
for United States Senator: .
.To say that Simpson's announce
ment* has caused surprise among the
legislative supporters of Senator Bulla
is not quite correct, for it is admitted
to-day by many that the Bulla men
have for some time suspected what was
going on, In the meantime everybody
is on the tiptoe of expectation. The
men who are on the inside believe. chat
the man from Mexico may, now be
able to make good some of his boasts
and may gradually. expose the plan on
which he was working when he said
he had the fight .won. There are many
.who believe that Simpson has , been a
Burns man from the beginning. Here
are some pointed interviews on the
subject:.
E. A. Meserve, attorneyâ The , whole
matter Is incomprehensible to me. Ido
not understand how : any. one could change
from Bulla under the positive Instruc
tions from the Los Angeles County dele
gation. Simpson .was always a little
wobbly and on what grounds he can jus
tify his vote must be determined by his
future course.
Frank Wigginsâ is a bad break.
â¢ Simpson must have been in a peculiar
mood. Just what his vote for Burns
means is hard to say, but he is certainly
not carrying out his instructions nor the
wishes of his constituency. : *
â  J. W. Hintonâ are many things
that can never be explained. Simpson
has deserted his friends here. It does
not matter whether we want a Senator
from Southern California, no man in the
face of Instructions should relieve himself
of such obligations unless honorably ab
solved. â'.â¢â¢__; : Â
C. D. -Wlllard, leader of the Bulla
forcesâ When Senator Simpson of Pasa
dena voted for Burns*, virtually acting the
part of a traitor and breaking a solemn
pledge entered Into by the Los Angeles
County delegation, riot to withdraw their
support from Bulla until a majority of
the delegates, should so* decide, Simpson
Is also false to his constituency. Pasade
na is for Bulla first, last and all the time.
Simpson Is false to: Southern California,
which demands that a Senator shall be
chosen from the south. He is false to the
Republican . party; because he seeks .to
fasten upon it the odium of electing such
a man as Burns. In the light of his vote
to-day Simpson acted the part of a hypo
crite 'as well as a traitor. Pretending to
be a firm friend: and supporter of Bulla
he has deserted that gentleman at a crit
ical period. His action on its face is a
plain endeavor to prevent a combination
of the anti-Burns and anti-Grant legisla
tors, thus giving Bulla. Barnes and the
remaining candidates a possible oppor
tunity to triumph over the objectionable
candidates. Simpson can never /explain
away the consequences of his treacher
ous act nor relieve himself of the odium
that attaches to it. He has forfeited 1 the
respect of . the people of Southern Call
fÂ°j!n L.' Slauson. president of the Chamber
of Commerceâ l cannot comprehend Simp
son's vote. The whole affair bears a : pc-
CU Robert o Kern-Simpson's vote was not
unexpected. It has been known that he
baa always a strong leaning toward
Burns While he has disregarded his in
structions and disappointed many of his
friends the break had to come and he
heads the procession. Simpson's c break
means, in my opinion, that by 'Monday
Burns will be the.next Senator..

Times .
State Senator Simpson of Pasadena in
yesterday's joint-convention of the Legis
lature bolted from Bulla and cast his. bal
lot 1 for the unspeakable Dan Burns for
United States Senator. . It has been in
timated as a . partial explanation Of
Simpson's action that when he voted for
Burns he was unaccountable for his ac
tions. It would be an act of charity to
Simpson to assume this statement to be
true, but although charity is conceded to
cover a multitude of sins, it will not cover
this particular form Of transgression.
Drunk or sober,' Simpson had no moral
right to vote for Burns. In so doing he
deliberately violated his pledges and his
obligations to his constituents in Los An
geles County and grossly insulted them
into the bargain. *
The Republican county convention, at
Its meeting in this city on Tuesday, Sep
tember 13, 1898, adopted the following res
olution as reported from the committee
on resolutions:
"We believe that Southern California is
entitled to name the next United States
Senator, and we hereby pledge our legis
lative nominees from the several Assem
bly and Senatorial districts of this coun
ty to that proposition, and all such nomi
nees are hereby Instructed to use all hon
orable means to secure the election of a
Republican United States Senator from
Southern California, and they are hereby
requested to vote at the next session of
the Legislature for a Senator from South
ern California until such Senator is
elected." . ' 3-
As shown by . this, resolution, the Los
Angeles delegation Was instructed by the
County Convention to vote for a South
ern California candidate for United States
Senator "until such Senator is elected;",
and to use all honorable means to bring
about such a result. In bolting Bulla
for Dan Burns.. Senator Simpson has not .
only committed an egregious act of po
litical folly, but he has bid defiance to
public sentiment in Southern California,
and has expressly violated the instruc
tions of the Republican County Conven
tion. The people of Los Angeles County
will bear Mr. Simpson in ungrateful re
membrance If he. ever again puts in an
appearance as a. candidate for any sort
of an office. He copjd. not be elected dog

It is true that the county convention in
structed the Los . Angeles delegation :to
vote for Bulla, but did not bind the dele
gates to vote -for*. him "first, last and all
the time," The delegation was instruct- i
ed however, as shown by the above reso- j
lution; to vote for a Southern California, j
man for Senator "until such Senator is |

When Assemblyman ; ...Huber changed
from Bulla to Grant he remained within

candidateâ and for the leading candidate
before the Legislature at that. The vote
of Simpson for Burns will not help the lat
ter's candidacy in any appreciable degree.
But it places the brand of ineffaceable in- j
famy upon the foolish: old man who has j
thus seen fit to violate his solemn obliga
tions to the people who placed him in a i

NEW YORK, Feb. 16. â Colli* P.
Huntington stated officially to-day
that the Central Pacific Railroad had
reached, a. settlement with the. Govern
ment for its indebtedness on account
of the Central Pacific and Western
Pacific Government aided bonds. He
further said that none of the details
of the reorganization of the property,
of which the payment of the Govern- ]
ment debt was an important portion,
were ready to be made public, as
changes would very likely occur.
The company, under the agreement
which was entered into . between the
bankers representing the road, its offi
cials and the Government commission,
will pay to the Government the full
amount of the outstanding: indebted
ness, both principal and interest. This
is to be done under the provisions of
an act passed by Congress which per
mitted the company to divide its in
debtedness up Into equal. payments, to
be distributed over a period of ten
years. * ;
The first payment to the Government
will be made in cash, the balance will
be secured by 3 per cent notes, interest
I on which is payable semi-annually, and
' the notes to be taken up year by year,
} the last of them expiring ten . years
j from the date of the signing of the
j agreement. These notes will be secured
I by deposits of Central Pacific 4 per cent
bonds. 3'
The debts of the Central Pacific and
Western Pacific roads to the United
States Government on February 1 were
$58,812,714. The Central Pacific owed
$25,895,120 principal and $36,604,385 inter
est, less $9,100,452 of judgments, bonds
arid sinking fund, leaving a debit bal
ance of $53,389,052. The debit balance of
' the Western Pacific on the same date
i was $5,423,662. : .'-."â¢ ' : ' -- 'y 7
A syndicate of bankers, of which
1 Speyer & Co. of this city and Speyer
i Brothers of London are the heads, has
â¢ nearly concluded arangements for trie
readjustment of the finances of the
i Central Pacific Railroad. . It is under
stood that a new mortgage of some
; thing over $100,000,000 will be issued, a
| portion of which will be exchanged for
J the present outstanding bonds of. the
company, and the balance used for the
settlement : of the debt to the Govern
ments.'.' '*--'.--": â¢',*.. * *â -â¢'â 
â¢ The immediate cash requirements
will be met by the sale of a block of
1 the new bonds, -which have already
i been underwritten by the syndicate.
; The balance of the bonds set apart for
the retirement of the Government debt
will be held by the Government as col
lateral security for the notes which the
Government accepts in payment. These
bonds will be taken up in a similar
manner as each one of the notes falls
due. __ -.
It Is likely that the stockholders will
be assessed a small cash payment and
that the present stock will be taken
up in its entirety by the Southern Pa
cific Railroad as an asset against which
â  a new issue Of the Southern Pacific
â¢-stock will be made to the present Cen
tral Pacific stockholders, share for

of 100 shares of Central Pacific stock.
POPE'S LETTER
ON AMERICA
He Speaks Highly of the
;3.'y v 3y'.;'y Church.' 1 J 7;
Copyrighted. : 1899, .by James Gordon Bennett.
ROME, Feb. 16.â 1 am authorized to
inform you, in . spite of all reports to
the contrary, that it is quite certain
the Pope's letter on Americanism will
be published. The document undoubted
ly will be Interpreted in various senses.
His Holiness expresses in it his views
upon the tendencies most unjustly, at
tributed to Cardinal Gibbons, Aich
bishops Ireland and Keane and the
Paulist fathers and Abbe Klein.
The adversaries of. the American
branch. of the church, who are them
selves responsible for and have in
vented under the name of American
ism the absurd phantom of a new re
ligion and an extensive conspiracy
against the authority *of the Roman
church, will, in all probability, use this
portion of the pontifical letter to mini
mize the gravity of the defeat which
they suffered a few months ago when
the Pope categorically refused to sign
a decree placing "The Life of Father
Hecker" on the index expurgations.
It is not yet known to the public that
this work had been condemned by the
congregation of the propaganda, but
this is the' case, the object of the anti-
Americanists being thus to discredit
Archbishop Ireland,: who wrote a pre
face to Father Elliot's book, as well as
Cardinal. Gibbons, the author of the let
ter that accompanies the sixth French
edition by Abbe Klein. .'
The refusal of the Pope to sanction
this condemnation of Father Hecker's
life was a severe blow to the opponents
of Americanism, as it reduced their ac
cusations to nothing. .'",__'â â 
'â  At the same time it will be found im
possible to distort or hide the general
sense of the pontifical document. Taken
as a whole it. will be found extremely
euloglstlc of the church. in the United
States and if the anti- Americanists are
satisfied with this meager result they
are certainly easily pleased. .

'â , NEW YORK, Feb. 16.â A -Washington special to the
Herald says: Chief Justice Chambers' decision in favor of
Malietoa Tanu, King of Samoa, Will be upheld by the ad
ministration. Rear Admiral Kautz, upon the arrival of the
Philadelphia at Apia-, will, after consultation with the Brit
ish and American Consuls, take such steps for the estab
lishment of peace and order in the islands as may seem ad
visable.
. This is the status to-day of the Samoan question. An
identical copy of the decision of Chief Justice Chambers,
delivered on January- 1, has been received at the State De
partment, and it will be made the basis of the representa
tions to the German Government. Besides this decision, the
department has received copies of the proclamations issued
by the three Consuls and the Chief Justice. - : 3 '
It was stated authoritatively that Rear Admiral Kautz
had been given ho instructions to place Malietoa Tanu on
the throne or to arrest Mataafa, ,as has been reported, but
he will act in the interest of peace and order upon the ad
vice of the American and British Consuls, and will also con
sult with the German Consul, should that official indicate
his desire to discuss the situation with the American naval
â â¢â¢" **
representative.
In view of Chief Justice Chambers' decision, the prob
ability is remote that the United States and Great Britain
will consent to the enthronement of Mataafa, though. con
sideration would be given to a recommendation to this
effect from the three Consuls should they submit it.
At the present time, however, the sentiment of the
American and British Governments is in favor of Malietoa,
and Germany will be required to recognize his lawful elec
tion. "
â¢'â  The German Government is still awaiting full reports,
and it is expected that as soon as they are received, which
will be within the next few weeks, it will close the incident
by withdrawing its Consul,; as requested by ; this 3 Govern
ment. -' - -
What will be done with Mataafa is . a question which
will have to be considered, for it is Relieved that as long as
he is in Samoa he will be a cause of trouble, and it may be â 
necessary to return him to exile.

DIRECTORS ARE
READY TO QUIT
Failure of State Raisin
; Combine
special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO. Feb. 16.â a special meet
ing to-day of the directors of the Cali
fornia Raising Growers' Association a
startling address to raisin growers was
issued and indorsed and ordered mailed
to every grower in the State in the
combine. It will be an unwelcome sur
prise to the community and particu
larly to those interested In the raisin
industry. â¢- 3y\ 3- '; *
The circular calls for a mass-meet
ing of the raisin growers for 10 o'clock
on the morning of March 1 at Armory
Hall. The directors will resign from
office then, conceding that the attempt
to combine this year is a failure and
that all contracts already secured will
be canceled then. March 1 is the time
fixed when 75 per cent of the acreage
should be secured to make possible the
. combine. Despite the active canvass
made for two months through the
newspapers and by the directors at
various meetings in the adjoining coun
ties, there has been secured less than
one-third of the 58,000 acres that the
association should have and there is no
hope apparently of securing one-half
of the acreage, much less 75 per cent,
by March 1, which is only two weeks
off.
The causes for this apathy among
the growers is discussed In the circu
lar and the conclusion is reached:
"There is just one reason why these
contracts have not been signed and
that is that more than half of all the
growers want to stay on the outside
and let others make a market for
them." : : '7^7'7.-. .
The circular concludes: The raisin
growers will remember when it Js too
late that for four years they have tried

SALINAS, Feb. : !0. A broken-hearted,
husband, a motherless child and a run
away COUple are facts which nor,
brought to light in. this city yesterday .
Only a few people knew of the rumor
and fewer still knew it was A fact that
Mis K. Dehlholm, the wife of a prosper
ous merchant as well as an indulgent
husband of this city, had: left home and
child in order to be with Chris Wide
man, the youngest son of Supervisor A.
Wideman, a wealthy marl of this
county.
When the rumor was first floated It
caused a wild sensation, but when the ;
published facts are known the many
friends of both parties as well as of
each '.'family will be greatly surprised,
The elopement took place last -Week,
but only lately did the parents of young
Wldeman and the husband of Mrs.
D.ohlholm find out that their suspicions
were correct.
The couple. it is asserted, left Gon
zales on Friday pi last week and went
direct t'OSa*. --.Francisco; where it is pre
sumed they are at present. Mr. Dehl
holm, when he was made aware of the
truth, became greatly angered and
highly excited. and it is claimed as
serted he would, pursue the couple to
the bitter end in order "to** recapture his
runaway spouse. He Is how In this
city, however, 'without his wife, but
claims a legal separation will be his'
sweetest revenge. -3
l;. Dehlholm and his family lived in
GotiialeS several years up to several
weeks ago. when he purchased an old
established business in this city. Doth
he and his family were well known
here, having visited often, and were
formerly residents. It was his inten-'
tion to move his family here at once,
but excuses of the- erring wife pre
vailed, and as a result she- remained in
Gonzales. Dehlholm was one of the
Ivlondikers some time ago. and it : I?
presumed that during his absence,
when, as he says, he was warking
hard â¢â  and risking his life for his wife
and baby, young Y?iden-.an became
her Intimate friend, and afterward her
lover. Peithohn returned, not recom
pensed particularly for his trip up
north, about rive mouths ago,: and en
gaged In business In the south up to
the time of coming here. Ills child, a
girl about seven years old. is at pres
ent motherless and In San Francisco,
while the father is almost broken
hearted and walks around his place Of
business in an aimless* manner* but
still averse to telling even his most in

NOW AN INDIAN MAY
LOOK AFTER INDIANS
NEW YORK, Feb. 16â A Washington special to the Herald says:
An Indian may preside over the House committee oh Indian Affairs in
the next Congress. Representative Sherman of New York, is chairman
of this committee in the present Congress and would doubtless be ap
pointed to- the" same place In' the next Congress but for the fact that it
is expected that he will be appointed a member â â  of the Board of General
Appraisers and will resign his seat, In Congress, v. "****__,
The second man on the committee is Representative . Charles Curtis
of Kansas, and he is very anxious to succeed to the chairmanship
Mr. Curtis' Is an Indian.; that is, he is one-eighth Indian. . One of his
great grandparents on his mother's side was a Kaw Indian, and he has
same of the facial characteristics of an Indian, though -he has not the
copper-colored -skin of the red man. "The father of Mr; Curtis was a hun
ter and trapper in Kansas in the earlydays. Mr, Curtis Is a self-made .man,
.and after starting In life as .a jockey on a Western racetrack he Studied law,
and was County Attorney of Shawnee County, has served in three Con
gresses and has been elected In the fourth;-, He takes a. great deal of.
interest th matters relative to Indians and has been. very useful. In the
'committee of the House charged with their Welfare. He: does not re- .
tain relations with the tribe; to : which his forefathers belonged, and he
does hot resent jocular allusions to. his Indian blood.
BRIDGE BUILDING AND *
ATTEMPTED BRIBERY
SANTA CRUZ. Feb. IS.â The Grand

American people will hold up the hands

commit Its . execution^ while Dewey and
Otis, and the brave men whom they com
mand, will have the support of the coun
try, in upholding our .nag where .It. now
floats, the symbol and assurance of lib

- What nation was ever able to Write an
acurate programme of . the war upon
which It was entering, much less decree
in advance the.scope of its results? : Con
gress can declare war, but a higher power
decrees Its bounds and fixes its relations

phase of the question there Is universal
agreement that the Philippines shall not
be turned back to Spain. No. true _Ameri_
can consents to that. Even if un^linng
to accept them ourselves. It "Id have
been a weak evasion of manly duty to^re
quire Spain to.transfer. . them - .to . some
other power or powers and thus -shirk our
: own responsibility. . Even It we h Â» n c ii n^
we did not have, the, power to -compel
such a transfer, It could not nave hten
made without the most serious Inter
national complications..' Such a course
could not be thought of. And yet. had we
refused to accept the cession of tnem
, we should have had no power over them
even for their own good. *-A c could pot
discharge the responsibilities upon us un
til these islands became ours cither, oy
conquest: or treaty. There was but one
alternative, and that was either Spain pr
the United States in the Philippines. The
other suggestions; showed, first, that they
should be tossed into the arena for the
strife of nations, or, second, be lost to the
anarchy and chaos of no protectorate ;lt
all, arid were too shameful to be consid
er, d. . The treaty gave them to the United
States. â¢ Could we have required less and
done our duty? Could we, after freeing
the Philippines from the domination of
Spain; have' left them without govern-:
ment and without power to protect life
and property or to perform the Interna
tional obligations essential to an inde
periderit; state?. Could we have left them
in a state of anarchy and justified qur
* selves: in our own ; consciences or before
the. tribunal of mankind? . Could we have
done that in the sight of God and man?
our concern was not for territory or
trade or empire, but for the people whose
Interest- and destiny, without our willing
It,, had been put in our: hands., 3lt was
with: this feeling that from the first day
to. the last riot one word or line went from
the Executive in Washington to our mili
tary and naval commanders at Manila, or
to our Peace.Commisloners at Paris that
did not put as the sole purpose to be kept
in* -mind : first, after the success of our
arms and: the -maintenance- of our own
honor, the welfare and happiness and the
rights -of the Inhabitants of the .Philip- .

which rested oh US and which did not re

. our duty by them With the consent of out

has tx-en met and fulfilled. in the. expulsion
of. Spanish sovereignty from their- islands,
and while the war that destroyed it was

but of their American emancipators. No

SAN JOSE. Feb. 16.â Mrs. EOnlce E. Poor, who for years conducted â¢;
a hotel fn Stockton, and a recent arrival from Dawson, is here: on a visit
to her daughter, Mrs. Dougherty. Mrs. Poor left Dawson on December
27 and arrived in San Francisco Februar- 5. ' . 7 -
"'- According to Mrs. Poor there is great wan": and distress. la Dawson.
She says dead bodies -re piled- like cordwood awaiting burial in the ;
deadhouses connected with the various hospitals.: There are at least 300
bodies of people who died without means for interment. These bodies are .
just wrapped in sheets and stored away on shelves or piled up. In
this mrnner they will keep for years. The ..ospitals ha Â« not. the
funds to bury them. Money is very scarce in Dawson, th-- Klondike
kings having taken their -gains abroad to spend. It. takes two men at
least two days to dig a grave, which makes it very expensive. Es
pecially at this time of the year no one will undertake the work- unless
well paid. Collections are taken up daily and weekly for the poor, but
not enough is raised, and there Is great distress.
Mrs. Poor says the unburied dead are at the. St. Mary's, Good Sa
maritan and Red Cross hospitals,; and some of them, have been in this
cold storage for months. Among the corpses at St. Mary's is that :of
Captain William Tyler, who for years was ea_/tain of the river steamer/

AMERICAN MINER
DEEPLY WRONGED
Outrage by Officials at

VICTORIA, B. C, Feb. 16.âAc
cording to miners who reached here
this evening by the Tees direct from
Dawson, George A. Harvey, an Ameri
can miner, working, in .the Klondike
district, has been made the victim of
outrageous treatment at the hands/of
some of the Dawson officials. y.
:.-'â¢' It seems that Harvey went into the
mining country in September last, and
after, a protracted- prospecting tour
found color on a piece of ground yon ;
Gold Hill. He lost no time in staking
his find, and was burying to Dawson j
to record and have it surveyed when he ,
: met Dominion Land-Surveyor: Gibbons
at Grand Forks. : He requested.Gib
bons to go up to his property and sur
vey it, offering to pay him the; usual
fee on the spot. Gibbons refused the
money, telling the miner to pay at the
e Land Office at .-â¢" Dawson. â â¢: v To . : prevent j

REFUSES MONEY
TO PAY SPAIN
House Knocks Out the
: Twenty Millions. â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.-Two very
sensational and unexpected things hap
pened in the House to-day during the
consideration of the sundry civil bill.
The par : raph carrying the appropria
tion of $20,000, .00 for payment to -. Spain
Under the terms of the peace treaty
was stricken out on _ point of order
made by Wheeler, a Kentucky Demo
crat, who declared that he opposed the
y appropriation on principle and would
resort to any technicality to defeat it.
The point of order was debated for
, hours, Its determination hinging upon
j the question .of whether the ratification
|of the treaty by the Senate and Its
; signing by the President vitalized , it
; without the action of the Spanish
| Cortes. Warrant of law was necessary
J to make the 3 appropriation in ; order.
Hopkins (R.) of Illinois who was in
the chair, sustained the point of order
against it; and upon an appeal his de-
I cision was sustained, 149 to 56. 7 x
j - -Cannon: 'then3att_-npted to have the
: api*ropriation inserted by unanimous
consent; ; but "Wheeler again objected.
: A strong Intimation was given by Can-
I non that a way would be found within
! the rules to make the appropriation be
: fore the adjournment of Congress. He
j referred undoubtedly to the probability
\ that tire appropriation would be placed
on the bill by the Senate.
After the sundry civil bill had been
completed and reported to the House,
Hepburn of lowa, the champion of the
Nicaragua canal bill, moved to recom
mit it with instructions to report It
back with the canal bill incorporated in
! It. 3 This was an unexpected move, as
it was generally understood that Hen
burn had abandoned all hope after his
defeat yesterday. Put he believed that
his motion would/ have : additional
strength in the House where members
could be put upon record. The action
was promptly declared out :of order by
the Speaker; thereupon Hepburn ap
pealed, and Payne of New York moved
to lay. the appeal on : the table. Upon
the latter motion the vote was taken
and the result was 97 ayes to 67 noes.
___â  no -riorum was developed-, on the
vote, owing. to the lateness of the hour,
they managed to carâ- an adjourn

a breathing spell in which to marshal
their forces for the final encounter, and
to-morrow, as soon as the House meets,
the vote will again be ta_en. . - - y

Special IMspcUoh to The Call.
PARIS, Feb. 16.â M. Felix Faure.
President of the republic of France,
died at 10 o'clock to-night, after an ill
ness of three hours.
. : ' : .. c . It has been known for some time that
his heart was weak, but the first inti
mation that he was sick was given at
6:30 this afternoon when a message was
dispatched to the Premier. M. Dupuy,
..â¢''â¢â¢â¢announcing that the President was ill.
M. Dupuy immediately repaired to the
Elysee.
All medical efforts proved futile, and
the President died on the stroke of 10.
The flag on the Elysee was immedi
ately lowered to half mast, and the
hews was dispatched to all the officers
and members of the Cabinet. General
Zurlinden, Military Governor of Paris,
the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of
Honor, the Prefect of the Seine, the
Prefect of the police of Paris and the
Presidents of the Senate and Chamber
of Deputies promptly arrived at the
Elysee.
The report spread rapidly through
the city and large crowds soon as
sembled in the vicinity of the palace.
About 6 o'clock M. Faure. who was
then in his study, went to the door
of the room of M. Legail, his private
secretary, which is contiguous to the
study, and said: "I. do not feel well.
Come in."
M. Legail immediately went to the
President's aid, led him to a sofa and
called General Bailloud, general sec
retary of the President's household:
M. Blondefc under private secretary,
and Dr. Humbert, who happened to be
at the Elysee attending a relative.
The President's condition did not ap
pear dangerous, but Dr. Humbert, on
perceiving that he was rapidly getting
worse, telephoned for Dr. Lanne-Long
and Dr. Kheulet. who arrived with M.
Dupuy, and were joined later by Dr.
Bergerey.
Though M. Faure still remained con
scious, the doctors soon recognized that
the case was hopeless, but it was not
until nearly 8 o'clock that the members
of the family were informed of the real
state of affairs. They then came to the
sora -where the President lay. Soon
after he began to lose consciousness,
and, despite all efforts, expired at 10
o'clock in the presence of the family
and M. Dupuy.
M. Dupuy communicated the sad in
telligence to M. Loubet, President of
the Senate; M. Paul Deschanet, Presi
dent of the Chamber of Deputies, the
members of the Cabinet and other high
functionaries, after which he addressed
the following dispatch to all Prefects
and Sub-Prefects in France:
"I have the sad task to announce to
yuu the death of the President, which
occurred at 10 o'clock this evening as
the result of an apoplectic stroke. Take
the necessary measures to inform the
pnpulation immediately of the mourn
ing that has fallen upon the republic.
The Government depends upon your ac
tive vigilance at this painful junc
ture."
It was not until 11 o'clock that the
news began to become known to the
general public in Paris. From this
time began a continuous arrival Of
public men. Strict orders, however,
were issued, and only members of the
( "abin-et were admitted to the Elysee.
The President of the Council and
Minister of the Interior, M. Dupuy, has
requested all Prefects and Sub-Prefects
not to leave their posts, and directed all
those who art absent to return imme
diately.
Nothing could have given the idea of
approaching death. Up to the very
last M. Faure indulged in his custom
ary habits of work and even in his
equestrian rides. He ate well and slept
regularly. Nevertheless, several times
ntly he had been heard to exclaim:
How weak my legs are!" and "I can
hnrrcly stand," or to make some such
â¢ :ark.
He left his study about the usual
,;.\Kdjur; at 7 o'clocJi last evening (Wednes
day), telling Ontjarret, chief of his
that he would ride on horse
back from 7 to 7:30 in the following
/morning (Thursday). He then retired
to his private apartments, dined with
his family, went to bed at 10 o'clock,
got up this morning at 6 and informed
his valet that he would not ride.
M. Legail. his secretary, on learning
of this, hurried to the President, whom
he found in his dressing rÂ»om about
6:45 a. m. Faure said: "I do not feel
ill, but I prefer to abstain from fatigu
ing exercipf to-day." ' Otherwise the
President worked as usual and read the
official documents and dispatches, with
the newspapers, as was his custom, in
order to prepare himself to preside at
the council, which assembled at 9 a. m.
M. Faure presided with his usual
ability, and on thrir taking leave the
Ministers could not have imagined that
they were pressing his hand for the
last time. He took his luncheon as
usual at noon, returned to his study at
2 o'clock and spent the afternoon seated
in a favorite armchair by the fire con
versing with M. Legail, who, about 6
o'clock, asked permission to depart. At
6 p. m. M. Legail returned, immediately
reporting himself to the President, who
was then signing decrees presented by
General Bailloud, according to hJs daily
custom. The work of signing was then
about over and soon ended.
General Bailloud had gone but a few
minutes when the President called M-
Legail, saying: "Come quickly. I feel
HI." When M. Legal] reached him the
President was rubbing his forehead and
paying: "I do not feel well." M. Le
gail asked if he felt pain and the Presi
dent replied: "I feel a general weak
ness. lam fainting."
Dr. Humbert, on arriving, gave ether
inhalation. He did not consider the
case serious, but on finding that his pa
tient did not revive he decided to in
ject caffeine. The President was ap
parently aware of the seriousness of
the attack, for he murmured: "Je me
sens partir. Je suis perdu, bien perdu!"
<l feel my senses failing me. I am gone,
all gone) and he expressed a desire to
see his wife and children.
THE LATE FRANCOIS FELIX FAURE.

exclaimed, "Je suis bien souffrant; je
suis perdu" am suffering greatly; 1..
am lost). 7y 3 v '-3. : - '7 : 7- -.."-' 7y -'.-.;!
At & o'clock, when the doctor: had ac
quainted M. Legall with his worst
fears, the ; latter informed M. DUpuy.
who announced his intention to come
to the Elysee, but on M. Legall -*. ob
serving that his presence might.need
lessly alarm Mme. Faure, who was not
aware of the gravity, of the situation,
the Premier said he would remain at
the Ministry of the Interior, in readi
ness to come at any moment. At the
same time he summoned the members
of the Cabinet.
Meanwhile M. Faure remained on the
sofa, repeating that he had no illusions
as to the issue of the seizure. His wife
came to him and he bade her an af
fectionate farewell. It was a touching
scene. He thanked her for the affec
tion and devotion : she had v constantly
shown him, and then he bade farewell
to his daughters, the doctors and his
personal attendants, thanking all for
their care and devotion and asking
them.. to pardon â  any *.; hasty words he
might ever have uttered.
Until a late hour the crowds remained
in front of the Elysee.

ceased their sales, and hurried off to

de Beaurepaire's candidature..

what Gerieral-Zurliriden, Military Gov

curious coincidence, M. Dupuy occupies
the same position which' he held when

to the English country gentleman.. He
rode, shot and fished with real enthusiasm,
and. his brief holidays had often been
spent on a small yacht; which he steered
as successfully as he guided the ship of

M.' Faure owed much of his success in
life to his father and mother, especially
to. the latter, who was a very remarkable

From the day' of ; his birth she began to

the use. that this sojourn in Great Britain
has been to .Felix Faure. * It enabled, him
to realise both the faults, and the virtues
of the average. Briton, and ..he Is said to
be the first President of the French re

Few people know that M. Faure was
: connected: and : that., too, by Ms own-
lantry, with the Prince of Wales; It .oc
curred during one of : the Havre regattas.
V yacht, the. Hildegard, belonging to his
Ro'val : Highness, was entered for . a race,
and Was lying in the harbor, One of the
sailors, Who, sailor like, was* quite ignor
ant of the art *of . swimming,; fell y over
board. : M. .Faure, who Was then . a well
known Havre merchant;' jumped into the
water and rescued the bluejacket. ,
".â â¢ Felix, Faure can boast of being the first
provincial President, .: for though he was
Parisian by birth,, he made his. fortune
and his name at Havre, the large sea
port town Which may be, called the Liv
erpool of France: It was there that he
began Quite humbly as a small commis
sion merchant in hides and wool; and .he
had only just laid the foundations ;of a
successful , business : when the : Franco-
Prussian war paralyzed French trade and
turned every able-bodied Frenchman Into
a soldier. Before becoming a merchant he
had been a tanner's apprentice. . -.*:*. .-*
As "commander of the Havre Mobiles he
ought through a long campaign, but his
chance of distinction came to him, aS it
did to so many, when- the war was prac
tically ended,; and "the red fool fury of
the Seine" had been let loose. .Paris was
in flames. M. Faure, Who was fortu
nately close at, hand, raised a company
of volunteer firemen, and, risking his own
life 1 again: arid again, threw himself into
the thick of the danger, encouraging his
men by his example, and working, incess
antly for three days and nights to sub
due r the conflagration; Two of his men
were killed .by his side and, after the
commune bad been : subdued, one of the
first acts of the Government Was to be
stow the cross, of the .Legion: of Honor
on the Havre merchant who had rendered
such splendid, service to France. :
.-. The President had been an active poli
tician for fourteen years.. . He : was
when he was first elected Deputy for
Havre, and had since been twice appoint
ed Secretary of- State for. 7 the
Colonies. He was the most capable Min
ister of Marine that that department has
yet had. and as a younger man he took
an active part in the Havre branch of the
League of Patriots. , _ : *;
- It can safely be asserted that before his
election not ; 1 per cent of those over whom
he was to become temporary ; ruler had
ever heard the name Felix Faure. ; The
world knows nothing of its greatest men;
but to those In the inner rln~ of republi
can politics he was considered a man to
be recokned. with*, and, as .it* turned put.
he was elected to the Presidency by 430
against 361 votes:
AN INTERNATIONAL COURT.
How Commercial Disputes Will Be
Settled With Canada.
CHICAGO, Feb, 16.â Times-Herald's
Washington' special says:
The Joint High Commission to-day
agreed upon the establishment of a per
manent international court of tribunal:,
sib-fiat to the Interstate. Commerce Com
mission for the. adjustment of disputes;
that may arise : from. time to time affect
ing commerce and transportation between
the United States and Canada, both by

ty-Eight Hours the Republic
"Will Be at the Mercy of
the First to Seize It.
Copyrighted, 1899, -by : th- Associated*^ 7Presa.7
PARIS, Feb. 16 "-"'President Faure
died to-night suddenly of apoplexy,"
says the bulletin, but it was really of
worry, apprehension and their effect on
his health; of the intoxication of the ex
alted situation, of imperial and royal
friends,
His doctor?! had long noted symptoms
of general paralysis. : . He meant well,
but he did great harm to the republic,
because .of . a . common-place men
tality .and .that; sort of. vanity
which Moliere ridiculed in "Le Bour
geois Gentilhomme." Louis XIV.. him
self, though standing on a right divine
pedestal, did not attach nearly so much
importance to courtly etiquette.
M. Faure had no insight into the
great problems of: human life, and saw
only ; externals. He revived, so far as
possible, the ceremonials of Napoleon's
court. Not even a Deputy or a Senator
could speak to him without being first
spoken, to. Whenever a French diplo
. mat who had freshly arrived in Paris
came to pay his respects M. Faure's
first question .was, "What are they do
ing at other courts?"
: It was noticed last week that the
whites of his eyes were . yellow; his
speech was thick, his step uncertain,
his neck bent forward and his under
lip inclined to drop. He was 68 last
January, I mentioned on last Tues
day to M. Clemenceau, who is a doctor,
these signs of premature old age. and
he said: "I also have noticed them.
If M. Faure is not soon turned out of
they Presidency he will die from the
general paralysis, the effect of -follle
dcs grandeurs.' ".'
: M- Faure alone was unaware that he
must soon resign, but no one save
Clemenceau and a few others foresaw
the fatal issue.*. The situation brought
on through his fault is most dangerous.
Never has there been a better oppor
tunity for a coup d'etat in France since
1852. ' 7-y
â  The republic for the next forty-eight
hours will be lying at the mercy of the ;
first man who Will seize it, but the
suddenness of M. Faure's demise' pre
vents the enemies of the republic con
cocting to strangle.her. Besides, . there
is no. man of sufficient prestige to make
a coup d'etat. The generals are dis
affected, but the soldiers, though hos
tile to the Jews, would hot obey if or
dered to fire on the Republicans. M;
Faure apparently died at the. nick of
time; 3. The reactionist forces.; under his
encouraging eye, were being gathered
to battle.
Goodness knows what he fondly
imagined. perhaps It was that a mili
tary coalition would hail . him as a
savior. M. Faure went privately and
unexpectedly last week to the opera.
Notwithstanding the surprise caused by
his visit the director's staff rushed but
to receive him." M. Faure's aid., de
camp, as.- the President advanced to
ward the stairs, made- a sign that the
attendants were to fall back a consid
erable distance to mark their respect.
He had received 1 a few days before a
letter : from the .Czar and had â¢ not yet
descended from the. high sphere.
At St. Petersburg .he was almost
shocked to find ..himself and â¢ the : Em
peror returning from the review with
out a military escort. After the Czar
had conducted him to Peterhoff Palace
M. Faure remarked: "How lacking the
Russian court is in dignity."
v His best point was genuine charity
for the poor and ; suffering. .. There, was
doubtless parade in his visits .to hos
pitals, but there was also : much kind
ness, : He gave handsomely to the poor,
though* closehanded in other respects.
His Thursdays were devoted to visit
ing hospitals, and *it was on Thursday
that he was called away.
The Elysee was no bed of roses to M.
Faure. He loved his grandeur, but he
dreaded ' blackmailers. Urbain '. Gohier,
one of the most respected journalists
in France, had threatened to expose the
jobs -..". of the * Madagascar expedition,
which, as Minister of Marine, M. Faure
had organized. Corruption and imbe
cility marked the enterprise to such an
extent that the 3. French Government
was compelled to â¢ send the artillery on
British steamers. He was. more civilly
treated by the crowned heads than any
other President. of France; and he was
a member of the most illustrious orders
or knighthood, save the Order of the
Garter and the Order of the Prussian
Red . Eagle. : The last grand function at
the Elysee was his admission into the
Order of ; the Golden Fleece.
- He was almost a business partner of
King- Leopold In Congo affairs. . .It de
lighted him to kiss the hands .of sov
ereign ladies. "He had; kissed those of
the Dowager Czarina, of the reigning
Russian Empress, of : Empress Eliza
beth of Austria, Queen Victoria, Queen
Dowager Emma of the Netherlands and
of Queen Wllheimina. He had been the
host of the Kings of Belgulm, Greece,.
Portugal and Slam, of the Czar and
Czarina, of -Prince Ferdinand of .'Bul
garia and of the Duke 'of Connaught."
Cervantes never imagined anything
more incongruous than M. Faure in his
palatial grandeur, and accepted, as a.
King and younger brother by European
royalties. EMILY CRAWFORD.

said . a member of the firm of Barnett
Bros., leading commission men. this af
ternoon,. when discussing the ravages
of the recent cold wave.
. . "Dispatches from our correspondents
in Florida show that practically the
whole thing is cleared out in that State
by the frost, so far as this year's crops
are concerned. Our correspondent
there says that on the east coast all
vegetables have been killed and pine
apples injured. What is true of the
east- coast is true, .of course, of the
north section of ..Florida. )'Â£â â¢ dispatch

to raise another crop of tomatoes this,
season for the Northern market. We
have already, received y some tomatoes
from the Miami section, but last win
ter they were shipping, tomatoes from
that section during four . full months. .
So far we have only received the early
portion of what is the ordinary Florida
tomato shipments. y We have advised
our customers there to plant beans at
once. Excepting beans, all : the usual
early vegetable crops from Florida.
Georgia arid South Carolina are Wiped
"in Michigan all the peach trees, or
at least a very large proportion .of
them, have been injured. I could: give
no hope as to them, for I understand
' that a temperature of -10 tb. 12 .degrees
below zero, : such as tney have been
having there, will kill ' fruit buds. . I
cannot look for any peach. crop at all
east of the Pacific Slope, for the tem
perature has . been sufficiently low in
every part . of the United- States â¢ east
of the Rocky Mountains to kill the
â¢ buds in the peach trees. -.: V vv
â¢'Plums,' â¢ apples and ..cherries; I think.--,

BANK COMMISSION REFORMS.
""TTHE Bank Commission of this State was estab
: I ' li<*hed by law in 1878. -The general scheme of
* the act \vi_s the selection .of three persons by. the
Governor, each of whom was to be free from con
nection, as officer or employe, with the banking busi
ness,â :â  and whose; compensation and expenses, held
within fixed limits; were to be paid by the banks in
return for.annual licenses by a pro rata. assessment on
deposits. Semi-annual reports were to be made to the
Commissioners, who in' their turn were to submit an
nual reports to the Governor, and each of .whom was
invested with the right of visitation and .examination.
The subsidiary powers supposed to insure the free
exercise of this . principal authority were conferred
â¢ upon the- Commissioners, who, In the event of vio
: lation of law by corporations or persons, if pre
liminary cautions proved unavailing, could invoke the
aid of the Attorney General and of the courts to sus
pend and .close, any banking business thus illegally
and unsafely conducted.
-Under. the original; act the Bank Commission was
organized and its operations continued for nine. years,
when certain amendments were adopted by the
Legislature, supposed to embody the results of prac
tical experience, and the essential points of which
were to broaden the class of incorporated banks
within the control of the statute, so as to avoid
technical evasions of its terms, and to. supply a cum
bersome method of liquidation under, the supervision
of the commission. In 1895 other amendments were
made, embracing more detailed requirements and
increased complications, and raising the salary of
each Commissioner from $3000 to $3600 per annum.
There have been hottest men and some who were
competent on this commission, but its failure to sub
serve the purposes of its creation is common kn'owl- j
j edge, and notably in those cases of dishonest man
agement and diversion of banking capital and -funds
which have wrought intolerable injury to depositors
and stockholders. Perhaps the most serious evil that
the commission was impotent, to arrest was the inter
mixture of commercial banking, which includes
leans upon personal .credits, with the ordinary func
tions of savings banks. The accumulation of the
net profits of industry into these institutions and the
earning of moderate interest by safe investments, when
adequately restricted and protected, is one of the
' most beneficial inventions of modern times. Pro
moting thrift and economy in the individual, it also
benefits the public at large by supplying capital for
legitimate enterprise. But the grafting upon the ab
solute security of loans upon real property or un
questionable collaterals of the special features of
commercial banks, and as. in this. State in ; many
instances discarding even their conservatism, has
given recklessness and fraud a free scope that has
brought .thousands of citizens to poverty and. dis
tress. The history of the Capital Savings Bank, the
People's Home Savings Bank and the Fresno Loan 'j
and Savings Bank, now emphasized by the failure of I
the Union Savings . Bank of San Jose, are sad illus
trations of the suffering and the loss produced by this
unnatural combination.
.' .-Mr,*' Evan J. Coleman, president of the first Bank
Commission, whose competency and whose integ
rity have never been .questioned, has suggested in
The Call, amendments to the present law that demand
prompt consideration by the Legislature. He pro
poses that the number of Commissioners be increased
to five, without which the proper examination of
all. the banks in the State list- impracticable, and that.
; the salary of each be reduced to the original sum of
j $3000 per annum. The increased expense will be
[ almost covered by the reduction of unnecessary out- j
lays, such as the printing of enormous reports,* that j
are simply unintelligible, because mainly composed of
bewildering labyrinths of figures. â¢'.. Instead of col
lecting the cost of the commission on deposits alone,
.' he .suggests, that it be levied . pro . rata upon the entire
resources of ; the banks. Eight cents or thereabouts
on the thousand dollars would cover the amount
necessary, and the. difference in yearly expense would i
be only : $4200. 3 The absurd provision of the existing j
law that ho gentleman having business of his- own |
should be appointed a Commissioner, : which invites, j
the selection of mere politicians or . business j
failures, is eliminated in the hew amendments. J
But the most important changes have yet to. be
noted. The first sure sign of embarrassment in a'
bank is the transfer of its securities, usually concealed
-fiiti- it is too late to : save depositors and ; stock
holders- The public will agree with Mr Coleman
; that all assignments of mortgages or deeds of trust
by savings banks should be recorded and certified
copies, furnished the Bank Commission, and that their j
validity should depend upon compliance, with these j
conditions. A still greater safeguard would he the
requirement of notice to the Commissioners from all.
banks of transfers or hypothecations, of securities held
by them. This would include collaterals the record
ing of which is not. authorized, by law and would
impart no notice. Such information supplied to the
Bank Commission would insure the stoppage of in
solvent or unsafe institutions before their assets are j
frittered away. It is also indispensable that the prac
tice of lending money on overdrafts and on personal
notes, indulged in by tome of the savings banks, be
permanently stopped..
These amendments should be substantially adopted
by the Legislature during the present session, for
within the ensuing two years they would prevent a
repetition of the disastrous record, of the Union
Savings Bank of San Jose. At the next session the
/entire scheme of the Bank Commission should be re
cast. It should be, completely withdrawn from the
influence of party. Able and experienced men, versed
in the banking business, but from, the time. of their
appointment free from all interest in existing, banks,
should be kept in office and not subjected to political
raids Or to the vicissitudes of gubernatorial patronage.:
Instead of being ; a quasi-independent y adjunct; â¢ the.
commission should: be so reorganized as to become
an integral part of the State, .government. Within I .
these outlines a legislative measure is practicable that
would supply all the. deficiencies of the present
system. 3.-"-'" 3333 3 : 3-* *33-3y '.'.-3 â¢3. '77.[ 'â â '. ..*'

plemented by a plan which will, eliminate office
seeking, political chicanery and bpssism from public

find a patriotic, intelligent- man, possessed of suffi
cient courage to dispense. with politics in carrying* on
municipal business, and place him at the head of af
fairs. But if. such a -man were found, and. so placed,
would our people keep him at the head of affairs? :
THE QUESTION OF PATERNALISM,
OUR esteemed correspondent, "'Horseshoer,"
who supports the bill creating a State board
of horseshoer examiners with an argument
which possesses some force, should not misunder
stand our position with respect' to that legislation.
We do not object to according to. the mechanics who
follow the occupation of shoeing horses any protec
tion which may be necessary to elevate the standard
of their trade or keep out of it disqualified or in
competent operators. Our point w as that there is
no stronger reason for invoking the sovereign power
of the State in behalf of that occupation than in be
half of the occupations of building houses, carrying
hods, setting type, writing shorthand, or, in fact, any
other trade known to our domestic economy.
Doubtless it is important that horseshoers should
be competent. So it is important that cooks, waiters.
and dishwashers should be competent. But no sane
person would propose bills requiring the Governor
to appoint boards to examine and issue licenses to
men' who follow .those occupations. It is, indeed,
better "for the people that all professions should, be
left to work out their own destinies, since interference
with them tends to convert them into close corpora
tions and restrict and stifle their development.* We
are opposed to all paternal legislation on this ground.
We stand solidly for the utmost freedom . of speech
and occupation, believing that. it-is. only by allowing
men to do as they please within the law that the best
civilization will eventually. triumph. ;*3
There is no. objection to horseshoers combining
for the improvement of their craft. On the contrary,
Such organizations. should be encouraged. Unionism
is a ; defensible principle . when administered .;-. by
rational men for the good of themselves and the pub~
lie. Strikes usually prove failures because they, are;
precipitated either to accomplish unreasonable ends
cr to turn aside the overpowering stream of progress.
But no sensible person can deny that the bane of
labor is an oversupply of men, and any rule of action
which will regulate this supply, ' elevate the standard
of work, dignify the occupation and maintain the
scale of wages, is of benefit to a community
The foundations of a state are said to repose upon
the muscle of its working classes, and those founda
tions must be more stable when the: men .who labor
are comfortable, happy, capable and. prosperous. .
But while all this is admitted, it is not conceded
that laws should be. passed to .â  interfere.* 'with freedom
of contract: or to restrict or. stifle, the development of
any trade or occupation. The horseshoers may or
ganize and adopt rules of the. regulation of. their
business with perfect freedom. . The. .Master . Horse-.;
-lioers' National Protective Association should: be
encouraged, and it. has our good wishes and support.
Hut it does not need and should. hot have a State
Commission appointed by the Governor, with. a
salaried clerk, janitor, messenger and stenographer
attached, to its organization. .We how have boards
of horticulture, viticulture, silk culture, labor- statis
tics and public works, besides railroad commissions,
bank commissions, medical commissions, . dental
commissions and Other similar devices for expend
ing the people's money, which are quite' sufficient to
show that the policy of regulating private affairs .by
law is all wrong. . Instead of more boards being cre
ated, some of those already in existence should be
abolished, y * '*.
A Pacific Coast and International Exposition, to
be held in San Francisco in 1901, is not within the
"national policy" or the "internal policy." of the
Examiner. _ This "blunderer and egotist" is equally
opposed to military or. civil enterprise that fails to
recognize its impudent and silly pretensions. Among
other things, it has recently interviewed fifteen la
borers, of whom it says eleven were "flatly- against
the proposed fair." To vary the monotony we sug
gest that it interview fifteen; hundred laborers, and
publish their opinions on the expansion project in
the Philippines. It would be interesting to learn how
many of them would favor the competition of the
Filipinos with American workmen.

Perhaps there has been in local journalism a more
silly attempt than that of the Examiner to create a

this circumstance the egotist and blunderer has built

Turner's. deposition, telling how the big

has been published; In addition to this
Invaluable evidence placed in the. posses
sion of' the defense in the action by Tur
ner,' there are other points held by Chief
Lees, which, together with the opinion of
Expert Theodore Kytka, who is conlident
that' the instrument is a forgery, will
doubtless prevent the collection of the
note, which stands .without a precedent,
if it is a forgery* as alleged, ''or amount
and clever execution. The only trouble
with the note is that it is too cleverly exe

the handwriting of. Mary Helen Murdock,
from- which the body, of the note, it Is
contended,. was copied, and the signature
has been declared by Kytka., as alleged
by Turner, to have been traced in part
and copied in part by a clever hand.
â¢ Chief Lees has long been in possession
of many of the facts testified to by Tur

the instrument. Lees immediately de
tailed Byram and Esola to interview Tur
ner, who gave the officers a portion,, of the
facts and placed in their possession a let
ter written by Megginson substantiating

held by counsel for. the estate, will prove
Megginson's complicity in the alleged for

-As stated by Turner, Megginson, In or
der to make it appear that he had paid
a consideration of; $80,000 to Mary Helen
Murdock .for. the .note, had sent to his
brother; William Megginson. who resides
LP iP Â°'." Â«nd procured several thousand
dollars which he paid Mary Helen Mur
dock, taking her receipt therefor. Mary
Helen/would then return the money, L
S,. Megginson would return it to his
brother and when . the time for , another
payment came the money would again
he shipped to this city and another pay
ment made. In this way it was made
to appear that a consideration was being
paid tor the note, but finally. Megginson
..lost. heart and determined that this course
would necessitate his committing per
jury. : Hence he wrote the letter to Tur
ner explaining his fears, and this letter,
it is contended, will result in his down
fall- , It, '-is. being closely guarded and
will be until the end of the trial, as It
is a declaration from the peri of Meg
girisori confessing criminal connection in
the case, and with it the attorneys for
the defense are confident of saving for
the heirs of the late William Murdock the
round- sura of $600,000. â¢
Turner, as. stated, did not put all the
facts in the possession of Chief Lees at
that time. Megginson had locked arms
with J. P. Frenna, the Italian barber,
and they were scheming as to how Tur
ner could be jailed for good. Turner re
fused to tell the entire story at the time,
nor would be agree to give any further !
information until they promised him that
he would not he called upon to give h _
deposition in the matter, until, he had
fought the charges they . had made
against him to the end. Turner said he
would never make "any statement to any
one or any newspaper until lie had beaten
every charge they had made or could
make against him. At the time Turner
would have had Megginson and Frenna
attested for perjury, but he knew that It
Would be of no use for him to have them
arrested at that time, as in his opinion
the District Attorney's office Would dis
miss any charges against them on the
ground that Turner was tag to destroy i
and break down the people's witnesses. I
Turner now says his time has come, al
though, It has â¢ taken him almost five '
years to beat his enemies. He has lived ;
up to his former resolutions, and as the j
end has now come for which he has so
long waited he will bring his persecutors '
before the people and give them the.hard-
. est fight they ever had to save them
selves from a life In prison.

ANTIMONYâ E. G. S., Livermore, Cal.
The extraction of antimony is attended
with some difficulties owing to the vola
tility and affinity for oxygen. The pro
cess consists in heating the crude ore
covered with charcoal on the bed of a
furnace, when the sulphide of antimony
fuses, leaving unmelted the earthy im
purities;, thereafter the liquid is drawn off
into Iron molds, where It solidifies Into
cakes or loaves. The latter are reduced
to coarse powder, placed on the bed of a
reverberatory furnace and. heated with
access of air. for the oxygen contained
therein, when the sulphur passes
away as gaseous sulphurous : acid,
leaving behind the antimony as
the teroxlde, The roasted mass is
then mixed with one-sixth of its weight
of powdered charcoal, the whole mois
tened with a solution of carbonate of
soda and raised to bright redness In cru
cibles, when. the metal antimony trickles
to the bottom and the impurities are left
above in the spent flux or scoria, which
is known in the arts as crocus of anti
mony. , â * ' ___ .
GUESTS AT A DINNER TABLE- J.
D. P. T., City. .The rule Of etiquette pre
scribes that, arrived in the dining-room,
the host places the lady whom he has
taken at his right hand and the gentle
man of the highest rank sits at the right
hand of, the hostess. All the other ladles
seat themselves at the right hand of. the
gentlemen who have escorted them. All i
these things are like the rules of the
Medes and Persians, and never- alter, so :
there Is no occasion for a lady, however
unused to company, to feel doubtful as
to what she should do. At all well reg
ulated dinner parties the guest card Is
placed on the table of the gentleman, who
seats the lady to his right. In case there
is no host, but a hostess, .that lady
marches to the head of the table and al
lows the gentleman who accompanies her j
to take the place that would be occupied !
by the. host, and -she assumes her seat
at his right, so that there may be a gen
tleman to her right and a lady to his left
and not break up the pairing which places
a gentleman between two ladles. If the
hostess has a sister,- her place Is at the
foot of, the table, vis-a-vis with the host
ess and her escort:

wheels slip down and rack every bone in

For seventy-two hours' riding, being the
half-way mark, Gimm has ridden 108
miles farther than the previous record.
He has covered 1-75*4 miles, as against
Miller's record of 1159 miles 859 yards
made at Madison Square Garden, New
York. :';'
To appreciate the race one must attend
Sufficiently long to get interested in a
rider and note the generalship used on
the track. It is this, fine work which the
casual spectator misses.- The struggle be
tween Gimm and Miller is the most in
teresting feature at this stage of the race.
Both are comparatively fresh, yet all the
speculation hinges on the question as to
which will break down first under the un
natural strain. Neither one will permit
the other to gain a lap on him while he is
on the track. Should he let one lap go,

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY IT, 1899.
as It were, by default, he would make
less resistance the next time and that
would be but the beginning of the end.
The cranks who spend hours at a time
at the race are commencing to develop
the "bicycle eye." The strain of watch
ing the riders as they circle about, coup
led with the dust they disturb, brings on
the fashionable complaint. It has become
the fad to drop in at the Pavilion at odd
hours of the day to watch the men, as
there is always something of interest.
Nawn, the sturdy young Irishman, had
hallucinations during the day and it was
with difficulty he could "be kept on his
wheel. He dismounted once and shouted
to his friend Fredericks, whom he
thought was concealed in the gallery. His
talk was Incoherent, rambling off on all
sorts of odd fancies. ,; :*"â¢'. y^'.

PIGGOTT AND

FORMER SCHOOL DIRECTORS
.-. UNDER INVESTIGATION.
Expert Kilpatrick Presents a Long
List of Misdeeds to Be Fully
" Consideredâ Bond '
â¢ Frauds.
The Grand Jury held a. protracted ses
sion yesterday â¢ and found - two . indict
ments against pickpockets as the net re
sult of Its afternoon's d -liberations.- The
men involved are the notorious John Plg
gott and Cal Childs, who in the past have
boasted of their pull with officials- when
under arrest for crime. The men are
now behind the bars for the robbing of
Gregolre Henriouelle of $130 on the
11th inst.
Officer P. J. Parrell and Special Officer
Henry Newman -were among the ' wit
nesses examined * by- the Grand Jury and
at- the conclusion of their .testimony in
dictments were found against the- two
crooks. The jury then appeared before
Presiding Judge Daingerfteld. where they
filed the indictments. Bail was fixed in
the sum of 15000 each. During the inves
tigation the jurors dwelt particularly on
the unnecessary continuances in the
Police Courts, particularly where pick
pockets are concerned.
The efforts to put a stop to the straw
bond evil are being continued and with
the co-operation of the Judges it ls hoped
to wipe out the practice. Clerk Kelly of
Judge Graham's court was before the
jury to explain his acceptance of three
$1000 bonds with ex-Policeman Hayes and
J. McAran as sureties. These men are
said to- be professional bondsmen and
Expert Newman of â  the Supervisors is
said to have so Informed Mr. Kelly. Mr.
Newman denied having said so when on
the witness stand yesterday. Captain of
Police Seymour swore that Newman had
made the statement to him In the pres
ence of Charles Morrison, a reporter. Mr.
Morrison substantiated Captain Sey
mour's statement. It was intimated by
a juryman that Mr. Newman would be
asked to reconcile his two statements.
Expert Kilpatrick presented a long re
port on the condition of affairs in the
School Department. It went into detail
as to the maladminstration of the de
partment under the former board, show
ing where money had been spent reck
lessly. The school committee of the jury
will dissect the report in an endeavor to
find something tangible upon which it
can proceed in order to bring the offend
ers to justice.
A. W. Foster, the railroad magnate,
appeared before the jury seeking In
dictment of some one who had wronged
him. He was not successful In his first
effort, but will appear before the inquisi
torial body at its next meeting.

DECIDED ON
TWO WAYS TO
KILL HIMSELF
By a Bullet and Then
.the Gas Route.
FINALLY CHOSE THE LATTER
WAS FRUSTRATED B_ A NIGHT
CLERK'S VIGILANCE;'
Police Are Puzzled to Know What to
! Do With the Man, Who Re- .
fuses to Give -lis True
Name.
A most deliberate - attempt at suicide
was made in the Del Mono lodging house,
21 Turk street," by a*. man who. gave the
name of George; Newton, and if it had
not been for the vigilance of Night Clerk
Isaac Wolfe. he would- have â¢accomplished
.his purpose. *.*
Newton, as he prefers to be called, went
to the lodging house Wednesday night and
engaged a room. Wolfe noticed that his
â¢face was swollen with some, disease' and
he complained of his eyes bothering him.
The butt end of a revolver was signifi
cantly sticking out of his overcoat
pocket. - â¢ -,' -â 'â¢..
About 3* . o'clock yesterday . morning
Wolfe's attention was attracted to New
ton's room by a smell of gas. The door
was locked and he had to force it open.
Newton was unconscious in bed, and the
room was full of gas. Newton had made
careful preparations for self-destruction.
He had pulled the bed to the middle of
the room so that the gas jet was imme
diately over his head. He had wet the
towel in the room and stuffed it under the
door so that none of the gas would escape,
and the window was closed. He- had :
twisted the bed cover round his body and
made a sort of funnel, which he fixed to
the gas jet after he had unscrewed the
tip and thrown it on the floor. Then he
turned on the gas and lay down to die.
Wolfe worked on the man several hours, .
and after getting him back to conscious
ness notified Policeman O'Connor., The
revolver had been placed under his pil
low, and he admitted to Wolfe and the'
policeman that his original intention was
to shoot himself, and he bought the re
volver on Kearny street for that pur
pose. He said he engaged the room, not
wanting his friends to know of his inten
tion to kill himself, but when he thought
of bespattering walls and bed with his
blood he made up his mind to take the '
gas route.. O'Connor emptied the car
tridges from the revolver and took .pos
session of it, and sent Newton to the In
sane ward in the Receiving Hospital.
Newton positively declined to give his
true name. He said he was an English
man by birth, but had been in this coun
try for eleven years. He brought his wife
with him. Three months ago he got a
divorce from her ln Sacramento on the
ground of desertion. He came to this
city about two weeks ago and had been
working, but this week he was unable to
labor, as he suffered so much from in
somnia,, which had driven him crazy. He
worried so much about his wife that he
began to think life was not worth any
thing without her. He had also been
bothered with a skin disease, which af
fected his eyes and face.
The police are puzzled to know what to '
do with him. He promises not to attempt
suicide again, but after his deliberate at
tempt not much "reliance is placed on
what he says.

YON TIEDEMANN ON TRIAL.
Accused of Committing Perjury in a
Former Case.
Karl yon Tiedemann is again on trial
before Judge Dunne and a jury on a
charge of perjury. During the trial of a
former case Yon Tiedemann identified ' a
photograph as the picture of a woman
who impersonated Mrs. Harriet P. Cristy
ln a fraudulent land transaction. The pic
ture resembles that of Mrs. Spencer, and
Yon Tiedemann was arrested for perjury.
He will admit identifying the photograph,
but will deny that he ever said or thought
that Mrs. Spencer, who Is the prosecut
ing witness, was the woman. Yon Tiede
mann has often been convicted on tiie
charge of having caused a forged deed to
be . filed for record, but his attorney.
George Collins, has always succeeded In
beating the cases in the higher court.
The prisoner will remain in the custody of
the Sheriff until the conclusion of the
trial.

THE BA^ FRANCISCO GALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1899,
t Japanese Procurer and Slaveowner Arrested and
..Confronted by His- Rescued Victim.
Justice of the Peace Kerrigan," acting, as
Police .Judge, is . responsible for this*
strange proceeding. -Whether from ignor
ance of the law or from & desire to ac
commodate, he fixed. : the.' slave. owner's
bond on the felony charge at the absurd,
sum of $200 and on . the misdemeanor
charge at.. $100.* .Tdda's hearing was set
for next Tuesday. .. - -
Chiyo, or Nia Koku Chiyo, .to give
her full name,, was as happy as a lark
.after a refreshing ; night's sleep at the
Presbyterian. Mission House. She uid not
look quite so picturesque in a plain black
gown as when, dressed in a gorgeous
robe, her* ' cheeks painted and her. head
surmounted by a brass crownlike affair,
the i symbol of her shame, she sat resign
edly in the dingy brothel to attract .the
admiration, of the Chinese patrons of the
place, but. she looked far happier; .She
informed Miss. D. M. Cameron, superin
tendent of the mission house, through the
medium, of the Interpreter, that, she was
."very. happy to be free and among friends
.who. would- care for her."
.' Captain Schell, United States Inspector
of Immigration-, visited the home in the
afternoon, accompanied by Deputy Immi
gration Commissioner Geffeney; who is al
leged to be mixed up' with the gang of
slave dealers who make this city their
headquarters, as official interpreter, to
examine the little Japanese girl. Inspector
Schell said this examination had no bear
ing oh any charges that. might in the fu
ture .be. preferred against Geffeney, but
was simply -to be used In" connection with
any action in the United States court as
a, result of developments in the case.. Sec
retary Kane was also present .with' .his
own interpreter, Furuga.--: The girl, told
substantially the same story as was .pub
lished exclusively in The Call yesterday
morning with additions. She said Toda
paid her passage from Kobe. Japan, to
Victoria, B. C:, but that Kiku and Koy
soshl were smuggled on board the steam
er'tb escape paying fare. - â¢Â«.'__Â»â 
Toda took them . to a Japanese board
ing-house- In Victoria and a few days
later disappeared. They remained there,
three weeks, when they were brought, to
San Francisco -by another man, whose
name she did not know, and taken to a
house on* Sacramento street, opposite
the Presbyterian Mission. After re
maining their several : weeks they were
sent for by Toda and removed to the den
on Brooklyn alley. As- soon as the three
little unfortunates saw . the gaudily
dressed inmates they, realized for. the first
time what was expected Of them, they
tearfully protested against being com
pelled to enter upon a life they, abhorred.
They pleaded frantically- with Toda- to
allow them to depart, but he was obdu
rate. He told them they had cost him a
ereat deal of money and he proposed to
get it back. They must do as. he bid
them as he was their master, and they
had no friends in this country who would
take their s part. Chiyo said she* was 18
years old by Japanese reckoning, but only
"17 years* arid 3 months by American time
measurement: :.'â¢'"*'â -â â¢ ' , -.ââ_â
* The ' examination lasted several hours
and when it was over Chiyo â¢ again ex
pressed her happiness/ at being free.-.
Secretary Kane discovered additional
evidence during the day to prove the ex
istence of the slave-dealing syndicate and
also unearthed some facts which wi.l â¢
make the task of explaining his connec
tion with the malodorous, gang extremely
difficult for. Deputy Commissioner A. H.
jGeff eney. The Japanese couple who were
reported as having paid Geffeney $.0 for
permission to land at this port have been
located. Their names are Mr. and Mrs,
Kito and they are living at 260Â£ Brannan
street in a Japanese boarding-house kept
by Mrs. Y. Yomamori. Kito was afraid
to talk to strangers for fear. of getting
Into trouble and at first denied all knowl
edge of any payment of $50 before he was
allowed. to land. . When questioned yester
day by Mr. Kane he admitted he had
no passports and finally acknowledged
that he gave his friend Morakamo, $00.
He would not say why he gave him the
Soney. but admitted that immediately
after its payment he was allowed to go
ashore Yo^m ori Informed Mr. Kane that
Mrs Yomamori informed Mr. Kane that
Kito had told her In the morning that he
had given the money to his friend. Mora
kamo. to be paid to Geffeney.- also
volunteered some interesting information
as to the methods pursued by the Deputy
Commissioner of Immigration. Mrs. Yo
mamori said that when she arrived In
this country seven years ago- Geffeney
had refused to allow her to land until she
had paid him $250. Some time afterward
her husband- and herself brought suit in
a Justice's court to recover the money
thus paid, but for some reason which
they never fully understood their, attor
ney allowed the case to be dismissed. Her
testimony is regarded as important In
view of the developments thus far made
in the investigation. _._._,
Morakamo, the man who acted as go
between in the alleged payment of $50 to
Geffeney in order to, induce the deputy
to allow the Kites to land, is living in. a
house on ' Stevenson street. 'He was out
of the city yesterday, but Is expected to
return to-day, and until he has been seen
his exact address is being withheld. *
When the steamer Queen arrived yes
terday * morning from British Columbia
elcVeh Japanese were on* board as immi
grants to the United States. Immigra
tion Inspector .-Schell', and Deputy Com
missioner Geffeney boarded the vessel for
the purpose of examining the immigrants
and ranged the Japs In a row in the sa
loon Then, at' a concerted signal, the
Japs walked one by one to Mr. Geffeney.
and each of them placed a five-dollar
gold piece in his hand. Mr. Geffeney
handed the money to Inspector Schell and
the foreigners were placed under arrest
on a charge of bribery and taken to the
County Jail. Later inspector Geffeney
swore' to a complaint charging the pris
oners -with attempting to bribe an officer
of the United States. ~. â¢â  - *
The fact that the Japs handed. money to
Geffeney is significant, in view of the se
rious charges â¢ alleged â¢ against the inter
preter-deputy. In connection- with the dis
closures concerning the traffic in Japa
nese slave girls. -.. The Incident shows, -that
the Japs had been coached ana tola tney
would have to put up cola before they
would be allowed to land, and the fact
that they handed the' money to Geffeney
would seem to indicate that he had been
designated as: the: official with whom the
business of bribing their,; way, into -the
country would have. to be transacted...
Secretary Kane has his a case well .in

MONEY AND VALUABLES BOLD
LY STOLEN.
Question as to' Whether the Bags Are
Rifled on Shipboard or at .
â  . 'rather End of the
Route.
â¢ Although. it Is claimed that every pre
caution has been " taken by the post
office authorities to ;'â  protect the mail
forwarded to and from Manila, nearly
every package and registered letter has
been tampered with and, in some' cases,
inclosed * money orders extracted from
them. This announcement will come
as a surprise to the general public
throughout the country as the postal
service was considered absolutely re
liable. â¢ â¢ " - 7-77 7.7.:: 77
-Whether from carelessness or pru
dence, prompted by direct motive, the
authorities have said nothing and ap
parently done nothing to stamp out the
outrage, although repeated protests
have been made.
Nothing of value that leaves this city
destined for Manila, or from there to
this city, through the medium of- the
postoffice, can now be deemed abso
lutely safe, and no positive proof -ban
be given that it will ever reach its
destination. 3 '33** . ,*- -'*.-. â¢ â¢
This has been proven an absolute fact
by the experience, of the soldiers, iri Ma
nila and their relatives at home who
claim they have never received pack
ages and letters mailed to them.. By
the statements of a number of friends
and relatives of soldiers., letters have
often been received with the upper por
tion torn off and in some cases with
the seal broken. Money, it is claimed,
has been repeatedly extracted from
sealed envelopes. .' - ; .*-.-.
The system pursued by the pilferers
is the simple one of gutting off entirely
that section of the envelope in which
the money is wrapped, and allowing the
envelope to reach its destination in a
state of mutilation. . . . -"â :*:. .*.*
Although this practice has been going
on continually since the war began, in
fact having â¢ its commencement be
tween this city and New York long be
fore the volunteers and regulars .left
for Manila, and although complaints
were made repeatedly to the postal au
thorities there has been no abatement
but rather an increase of the practice.
No apparent effort has been exerted
either by the army officials or the pos
tal authorities to suppress the outrage.
Whether the robbery was done by men
in the employ of the Postoffice Depart
ment or outsiders is not, nor can it be,
definitely stated; -but it is inferred by
those who have suffered that the let
ters have, been opened by regular em
ployes of the department. .
Where the letters sent to and from
Manila have been tampered with is a
question of opinion.' Some: advance the
theory that it is possible, and in fact
likely, that the letters have been and
are being tampered with at Manila by
the soldiers who are detailed there to
collect and handle the mail before it is
finally turned over to the postal, agents
for' shipment to the United . States;
Others claim that this would be impos
sible as the authorities at Manila would
immediately detect the. outrage by
viewing 'the broken seals that must
necessarily pass through their hands.
They suggest the idea that the letters
are opened while on shipboard on the
journey from the Philippines- .to this
city. This theory was almost conclu
sively proven a few days ago when the
mail aboard the transport Valencia was
overhauled. In one of the bags a letter
was found with the entire upper section
of the envelope removed, it having been,
cut away for the purpose of extracting,
the inclosed money. .
Aside from the taking of money from
letters valuable packages have been
stolen outright". Those who send articles
of this kind of any value whatever take
the risk of their .never reaching their
destination. People of. this city and
elsewhere. who take ah. interest in the
volunteers are surprised, after , several
â weeks or months .to find that .their
packages have never reached Manila.
The reason is now perfectly apparent..
They were probably stolen en route. .
Whether the fault lies with the postal
authorities or not is not definitely
known at this time, but the problem of
detecting the guilty parties seems to
many a simple one, which could be ac
complished should an earnest effort be
made In that direction. ".''.'"' 3 V :

â¢ ". The hopes' *'of the defense in the Brandes
murder trial: are slowly dwindling into
â oblivion. At .the. trial to-day. a surprise
Was sprurigby the accused murderer's
attorneys, .whereby one of the mainstays
.of their Own hopes was. dashed to the
ground.- ;â * 3
The accused murderer, has all along
'claimed., that his daughter, 1 Lillian
Brandes, had first taken poison and. then
hanged herself. So determined was the
defense to establish this point that when
Professor George K. Colby, an expert on
poisons and their effects, testified at the
preliminary* examination Attorneys Ben
nett- & Sawyer .. closely and vigorously
cross-examined him for several, days. *..
â¢At. the trial this afternoon District At
torney Allen again called Professor Colby
to the stand, but before he had been asked
7& single question -.the defense, for. some,
unaccountable reason, announced that the
testimony of Professor Colby to the effect
that ho poison was. found in Lillian
Brandes" stomach or the tissues thereof
Is admitted.
â¢' The. prosecution was quite. as much sur
prised as Judge Hall appeared to be, for.
ft had expected to occupy the remainder I
of the afternoon with this expert. As a :
consequence of. excusing Professor Colby,
4ri& because it Was deemed too late to
secure the attendance of the. other -medi
cal experts, the. trial went over until to
morrow-morning, when Dr. H. S. ButeaU

â¢4 Mesdames. Green;, was also in court, and |
told of the family troubles. : Some years [
-:agojohn Green went to the Luney horn* [
â¢ and took away Miss Lizzie, who was then i
â  -.IS*-, years old. Green and Lizzie com- ]

â¢-when. Green forestalled' her by declaring]
that- ho had married the child by con

" Was. satisfied, and Green and Lizzie were
â always known as* husband and wife from

/..testimony to .support, the story told by
. Mrs. Vanderwater. â¢ â 
â  . A month ago Green .became tired of the \
girl he. claimed to have- . married seven
years ago, so he came over to Oakland
: with her sister Maggie and they were !
married by Justice Quinn. * .Maggie at i
this time was well aware that for seven I
years Green had passed as the husband
of her younger sister. ]
The second Mrs. Green was placed on ;
the stand by Prosecuting Attorney Leach,, j
. and without a blush admitted knowing
that her sister had long been regarded j
as Mrs. Green. . She said she had con
sented to marry Green because he had i
shown her a paper signed by her sister J
releasing Green from his marriage con- j
tract. After she saw that paper and also j
his discharge papers from the army. In
which he was set down as a single man,
Maggie supposed he was legally single,
and married him. . â¢ '.
As the prisoner left the. courtroom after
adjournment he spoke a few words to the j
second Mrs. Green, and she seemed to j
be quite pleased with his attention and
expressed no ill feeling toward him for i
deceiving her regarding his being, single
at the time of the marriage in the Oak
land courtroom. The case will be re
sumed Saturday.

THINKING OF
PLANS TO WIN
THE ELECTION
Candidates Want a
Short Campaign.
AMBITION GROWING FAST
OLIVER LINDSAY WILL BE ON
THE BALLOT.
The Sixth Ward Will Be the Scene of
a Bitter Fight for Councilman.
.'"" AnnÂ»_ted District Causes
Anxiety.
.7- Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 16.
This is the first city campaign in which
the large annexed district figures, and on
the vote in this territory probably hangs
the-, fate of the two parties. In the an
nexed district there are nearly two thou
sand votes, and should these go more one
way than another, it may upset all po
litical calculations. At the last city elec
tion there were 9500 votes cast. This time
there will proably be nearly twelve thou
sand. The line existing between the two
political . factions for several years past
has' been very close, a hundred votes rep- â 
resenting the difference for the past four
years. It can easily be seen that every
thing depends on the extra votes which
are to be cast at the coming election for
the first time. - â¢..]â¢''. .
Everybody wants a , short campaign.
Little, more than three weeks will elapse
before the election and no party will make
a start for another week. The Republi
cans will make out their programme next
Wednesday night, and will, if possible,
hold four meetings in the annexed dis
trict. â --:â 
.The Democratic City Central Committee
will also meet next week to arrange a
programme. The Independent party in
tends to open its campaign one week from
next Friday night with a mass meeting
at the Tabernacle, at which ex-Mayor
Davie will" speak- -
The Sixth Ward is going to be as lively a
battleground as ever. There is an old say
ing that blood always flows in this ward
at' a primary or election, and the pros
pects are good for such an exhibition this
time. Louis Schaefer, an independent Re
publican and ex-Chief of Police, Is mak
ing an active campaign. "Billy Watkin
son", of the rotund face and "Solid Six,"
and now' proprietor of Councilman Earl's
saloon, is letting no grass grow under his
feet, making an independent canvass. Mr.
O'Gara, an old-time Democratic warrior,
also wants the plum. The regular Repub
licans have nominated Miles Doody,
late of the Fire Department, and a vet
eran politician.
â¢_ The Municipal* .League has set up
George B. M. Gray, who also believes he
is a winner. This. political ward will cer
tainly be heard from March 13.
Oliver Lindsay is the most persistent
office-seeker', on the ticket. Oliver has
always figured at Populist, Democratic or
I Independent conventions as an orator, but
I not as a candidate. Two years ago he
! made an active campaign in the First
Ward and received .forty-five votes.
Nothing daunted, the aged campaigner has
already filed his. petition to run again as
. an independent candidate from the West
End. ".. * 'â¢â ".' , â 'â  ,
E W. Baylls," a housemover, is depend
ing "on luck to be elected to the Council
from the' Third Ward. While moving a
house some time ago he found some
money concealed beneath the floor, and
Sine* that time be. believes he is a lucky

WATER DEAL IS
TO BE CLOSED
IN SIXTY DAYS
-â¢.-â â ..- ...
Stockholders Nearly
Unanimous.
THREE MILLIONS THE PRICE
CONSOLIDATION OF RIVALS A
CLEVER MOVE*
The Competition Has Cost the Contra
Costa Company Five Million
Dollars in Four â¢ "
Years.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway," Feb. 16.
Within sixty days the final act in the
consolidation of the water companies will
have been transacted, -.nd Oakland will
be without the benefit of competition.
The experience of the last four years has
cost the Contra Costa Company five mil
lion dollars, two millions of which have
been lost owing to competition and three,
million dollars represents the price paid
to Hayward and Dingee for their plant.
The details of this deal show to a great
extent the inflated value placed upon the
Oakland Water Company plant by Its pro
moters. Before the committee of the
<_uu!k-1 a year ago Mr. Dingee argued
that the value of his plant was some
where between four and Aye million dol
lars, and on this capitalization he ex
pected the reasonable interest allowed by
law. The deal practically clinched at to
day's meeting of the directors and stock
holders of both companies shows that at
the value of shares to-day the amount
paid the new company is $2,505,000.
This morning the directors of both com
panies and many of the shareholders at
tended a special meeting to consider the
proposition of absorbing the Dingee com
pany. All the large Interests were rep
resented, but there was not a sufficient
volume of the stock authorized to vote
to completely close up the transaction.
Additional names of shareholders will be
obtained forthwith and at the annual
meeting of the Contra Costa Company in
April the Dingee company Will be com
pletely absorbed and Its plant, franchises,
books, consumers and business will be
come the property of the Contra Costa
corporation. .- : .
Some facts were brought out at the
meeting which show that there is danger
of a scarcity of water unless both plants
are acquired. At present Lake Chabot
contains but fifteen feet of water, which
point has never been reached since Oak
land was half the size it is now. Some
of the stockholders objected to a deal
mainly on account of the price to be paid
for the Dingee company, but the Contra
Costa officials showed that two million
dollars had already been sunk, and that
as an additional plant is necessary, it Is
quite cheap to buy off the opposition and
obtain all necessary plants for a dry sea
son for an additional $3,000,000.
One objector declared that the Dingee
I plant would be expensive at one mlllon
dollars, but a majority of the directors
I and shareholders had determined on the
j deal and objections had no .weight.
Victor Metcalf , who represents the Cha
bot Interests, says it will take sixty days
to make the formal transfer. He says
! the consolidation is a necessity owing to
j drought. *
End of a Sensational Suit.
OAKLAND, Feb. 16.â The interesting
finale of the sensational suit of George
H. Francoeur against E. Norwood Jones
and Gertrude K. Jones for the recovery
of $500 claimed on a promissory note,
which last week was decided in favor of
defendants, who alleged fraud and con
spiracy, was developed to-day by a cross
bill' filed by Attorney George de Golia.
* In his bill De Golia asks for $574 75 as
costs against Francoeur. Recently in the
disbarment proceedings against Attorney
Joseph Hutchinson, instituted by Fran-,
coetir, a judgment for $66 and costs was
rendered against the latter, but it was
found impossible to collect it because no
property could be located upon, which to
levy execution. "3-- *

Victim.
Special "Dispatch to Ths. Call.
SAN . BERNARDINO, Feb. 16.â
Livermore shot his wife about 7 o'clock
this evening, putting two bullets
through her right lung and then put a
bullet through his own head. ; He died
Instantly. There has been family
trouble between them for several years
and many quarrels in which he
threatened her life. Livermore -was a
driver for Brazelton Brothers' livery
stable. He was injured several months
ago, crippling him seriously. He leaves
three children. 777:
Livermore and his wife have been
divorced three years and she has been
supporting herself and children, having
charge of a dressmaking establishment
connected with a dry goods' store.
Livermore called at her house to
night while she was getting supper, and
with but few words drew a revolver
and fired, the bullet striking her in the
left breast and coming out under the
arm. He aimed for her heart, but as
he pulled the trigger she partly turned
to flee and the bullet made, a severe
flesh wound, but it is thought it will
not prove fatal unless blood poisoning
sets ln. .7:77^ 7.77 -7 ::
As she fell Livermore turned the re
volver to his own head and pulled the
trigger, the bullet going through the
head and striking the door frame, mak
ing a wound that proved instantly
fatal.
The children were in the house at the
time, but did not see their father or
know he was there until they heard the
shots, L.vermore passing through the
house from the front door and shooting
his wife in the lattice-work kitchen
where she was preparing supper.
The full name of deceased is Albert
Hamlin Livermore and his age 39. He
has been a hard drinker and has no
home more than the livery stable where
he worked. He has a brother now do
ing time at Folsom known as
"Smoothy" Livermore.
Contests His Father's Will.
James R. Wilson filed a contest yester
day to the will of his father, John B.
Wilson, who died recently, leaving an es
tate valued at $3000. The contestant, who
failed to receive a son's share of the es
tate, avers that his father was of un
sound mind when he executed the testa
ment in question. Hence he asks that
the will be declared null arid void and
the estate distributed according to the
laws of inheritance. ;â¢'â¢_â¢>â

FT son' of Michael F. Dwyer, the noted
. ' I . .New York turfman. The wedding.
â¢ the friends" of the bride-to-be ex- |
pert. wIU be celebrated in Chicago early |
'. on Saturday morning, just after. the.Union ;
pacific train pulls into the depot.' The
happy .man. is to be on hand with a cler
gyman and' his friend Tod Sloan, who, in
his capacity as . best man. may .be per
mitted to kiss. the young wife. After the
ceremony the newly wedded, couple are
to go to the Auditorium, where the pe
riod frequently referred to as "they lived
happily ever. afterward" is to be spent.
The wedding of the millionaire horse
jnah and the fair young Californlenne is
the result of a. romantic courtship in
â which filthy lucre was spurned by an in
dignant, virtuous maid and a sighing :
lover put aside his scorned purse and
offered in its place his hand in honorable
marriage. . In the tale of triumphant vir
tue a daring- young Rough Rider and a
pmart woman: figure prominently and
lend an added interest to a story that
for the past two days has been the piece

men of the track and the many other

Mai .Webber made her debut in the
business world of this city as a stenogra
pher in. a banking establishment. She
hailed from Oakland, where she made her
horhe with her widowed mother. She soon,
however, left business and home and took
up her residence at Mrs. Salisbury's room
.; ing- house, 695 Geary street.
While all of Mai's friends admit that
the beautiful stenographer was not averse j
to having what they term a "good time," |
they are unanimous in declaring that no i
'smirch rested upon the fair name and
fame of the lovely girl.
Some seven wee.ks ago a "Rough Rider."
wlt-h the Cuban fever in his bones, came
from his home in New York to this city
to recuperate. One of the first of the
many pretty girls that were presented to
\ him was Mai, and the soldier and the
damsel soon became fast friends. The Cu
ban hero and Mai were seen everywhere
together and it soon became noised about
In thtir particular world that the pair
were engaged to wed. Rumor, however,
as is usual, was at fault, and subsequent
developments prove that the man gossip
declared Mai was to marry Was the man
who was instrumental in securing for her
a wealthy husband.
it was while in the company of the sick
soldier that Miss Webber first met the
wealthy turfman. Dwyer had followed
the girl about for nearly two weeks and"
when one evening he saw her at the Zink
and dining with her Rough Rider friend
he sent his companion, Tod Sloan, to the
soldier and craved the favor of a formal
introduction.
Mai and Dwyer met the same evening
at a gathering given for that purpose at
a high-toned restaurant. There were nine
In the partyâ Mhi and a lady friend and
seven men, among whom were Dwyer,
Sloan and the soldier.
- 'The wine had gone round, but the dance
had scarce begun when Dwyer induced
Miss Webber to join him In an adjacent
apartment. Here he made her a burning
declaration of love, painted in glowing
terms the liff of ease and pleasure he
could afford her and concluded by offer-
Ing her: his check for $5000 if she would ac
company him to London, whither he was
going with his friend. Tod Sloan.
Miss Webber haughtily spurned the
' base proposal and went to her soldier I
.frierid-.to sob out her troubles.
V At this stage of the game Mrs. Mollle
â¢Wfttson appeared upon the scene.
:.'. .Mrs. Watson acted as Dwyers go-be
tween. She painted to the girl in glowing
. terms the brilliancy of a life such as was
proposed. It is!. rumored in the world in
which she lives that a railroad ticket to
New York was the consideration for
which Mrs. Watson labored. Unfor

A DARING CRIME.
Market Street Show Window Bobbed
in ; the Light of Day.
... Goldstein & Conn's large show window
at. 822 Market' street,; in which was ex
hibited 5200 worth of prizes to be award
ed at the Elntracht . Verein masquerade
ball, advertised for next Saturday even
'lng, was broken Into by some bold thief
or thieves about 6:30 Wednesday morning.
An aperture about a foot square was
made by cutting the plate glass with a
diamond and all valuables taken
; The theft is but another of a . series
which have taken place on public thor
oughfares while the police watch was be
ing changed. The officer on duty previ
ous to the occurrence reports that .he
passed the window at 6 o'clock and again
ten minutes later. . J. Maloney, private
secretary to Mayor Phelan, says :he
passed there at 6:20. Both are positive
the window was not broken when . they
passed." At 6:45 the officer who succeeds
the night patrol discovered * the .': broken
plate of glass and remained on guard
until the arrival of the â¢ proprietors of the
store at 8 o'clock. Among the articles
taken were a gentleman's gold watch, a
lady's gold * watch, diamond â¢ locket,
breast-pin, lady's ruby ring, diamond ring,
diamond earrings and; gold cuff buttons.
The thief overlooked a couple jof clocks,
a lady's pin and a scarfpin.
The robbery was particularly bold, hav
ing been committed after day had
dawned, , and almost In the " immediate
presence of hundreds of people who were
passing on their way to work. The break
ing of the plate : glass, which Is three
eighths of an inch in thickness, must have
made a loud noise, yet it seems ; to have
been heard by no one. .
I The managers of the ball will bear the
loss of the prizes. They have duplicated
them, however, and they will be distrib
uted as advertised on Saturday evening.
The damage , to the window is $200, but
this is covered by insurance.

THE l STOBY OF AN \ O'FABBELL
â¢ STREET FLAT.
Residents of a Quiet Neighborhood \
Protest in Vain to*fhe Authori- ; ,
ties Against the Affliction ., ;
. of Midnight Bevelry. _ : â  ' V '.
Police Captain George W. : Wittman and
Chief of Police Lees have â  clashed. The
Chief' thus far has had the best of the
encounter, but the Captain is suppressing
an expression of his chagrin with a hope
that the residents of a very . reputable
part of : the city will raise , an. indignant
howl to vindicate him. Captain Wittman
says he must bow to the orders ; of his
superior, but in bowing he suspects that
the orders have a suspicious . aspect. . .The
trouble . between the 'two police officials
has been ! brought about by- a woman. '
About a month ago! the quiet residents
of O'Farrell street,- near Hyde, received
an addition to their : number, and a shock
to their feelings in the presence of a new
tenant in the block.-.-. The newcomer was
a woman and evidently. popular at un
seemly hours of the night. She was gra
cious in her reception of her friends, and
welcomed them with particular good will
after the electric lights . went [ out. ' Cabs
rumbled up to her : door when her neigh
bors were deep in slumber and were dis
turbed; from '"their sleep vby the clash of
the wheels and the clang of the bell upon
the door. '>--t7 *'-*-*' "â 'â 'ââ â 
Now and' again the silence of. the street
would be broken by the sound of revelry,
the music of midnight pianos and the
laughter of - noisy, boisterous voices.
O'Farrell street was shocked. Whisper
ing of the scenes in the new tenant's flat
grew into indignant protests - that found
expression at police headquarters. A
committee of O'Farrell street residents
went to the City Hall and registered a
formal complaint against the new tenant.
Protests came from every side and an
investigation was made.
Captain Wittman,* whose duty it is to
see that reputable districts of the city
are 'â¢. not ' molested by undesirable new
comers, instituted a rigid inquiry. He
discovered that the woman .whose pres
ence was objected to was not unknown to
him. He declares that he forced her to
leave a house on Eddy street because of
her conduct, and he determined to make
her give up her flat on O'Farrell street.
â¢When the woman received her orders to
leave Captain Wittman: also- threatened
to: blockade her house with bluecoats un
til she did leave. .â ',â¢â¢:' ~; -'
Before the time .came for: the woman
to go,- however,- Captain Wittman '. was
startled by receiving oruers from Chief of
Police Lees not to molest the woman and
to permit her "to remain where she is.
Captain Wittman says he could do noth
ing except obey the orders of his superior.
The woman whose presence has shocked
a neighborhood" has not been molested in
what her neighbors insist is too pro
nounced a hospitality. In discussing the
affair last night- Captain Wittman said
somewhat pompously that he is a devo
tee to official. superiority,". but If cabs con
tinue to disturb the slumbers of the resi
' dents of O'Farrell'-street,' near Hyde, and
new protests ' are made to him he will
again report I the ' matter ; to ' the Chief of
Police. - - - 'Â«'â¢ ' -
Captain -.Wittman, says- his hands of
ficially were tied by the Chief of Police
by the assertion ' that the woman, of
whom complaint has been made, has
promised to silence , the vocal and instru
mental music of her flat after midnight.
â  The captain has taken the matter very
seriously. â¢ "Complaints were made to
me," he said, "and I ordered an investi
gation. This v woman once occupied a
house on Eddy street and I ordered her -to
leave it. â¢ She obeyed the command and
I knew nothing more of her until the
protests against her j method of enter- \
tainment came from people living on i
O'Farrell" street. I would have ordered
her to leave there- but Chief- of Police
Lees says that I shall ta^e no further
action in the matter. That Is all there is
to the ' affair. Chief Lees , informs me

Solemnization â¢of Ash Wednesday,
â y\;ythe First of; the Forty Days v;
'â '.'.. of Fasting. .'t' * '"'"..
: Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent,
was solemnly, celebrated. yesterday, in the
various Catholic churches throughout the
city. ! Solemn high mass was said at a
late hour ;in the morning, immediately
after which the blessed : ashes ; were ad
ministered.^
With the advent of : Lent all amuse
ments, as far as good Catholics are con
cerned, cease.. The forty days preceding
Easter Sunday are supposed to be de
voted to sacrifice. * Every one within the
pale of the church is supposed to make
an undue . effort to do something during
the coming' six weeks in the way of self
sacrifice. It is a time when all are sup
posed to be drawn nearer to God by fast
ing and the offering/of prayer.
In nearly all the churches an estab
lished form of service will be held for
each day during the Lenten season.
Masses will.be said almost as on Sundays
with the exception that the high mass In
the late morning will be omitted.
I At St. Mary's Church (Paulist) masses
will be said at 6:30, 7:30 and 8 o'clock In
the morning. Every Monday evening the
service will consist of a sermon, the recital
of the rosary and the celebration oÂ£ bene
diction of the blessed sacrament. On Fri
day evening the stations of the cross with
.benediction will be said. This regular
form of special Lenten devotions will be
observed generally in the various
churches in the city. /",;, v â â_
The first Sunday of Lent will be com
menced at St. Mary's Cathedral with the
inauguration of a two weeks mission by
the Redemptorist Fathers. It is expected
that it will be well attended, as an op
portunltv of this kind has not been af
forded the parishioners of the cathedral,
for a year or more. What the conditions
of the mission will be or whether It will
be divided for. special instruction for. the
women one week and the men the next
will be announced from the pulpit next
Sunday morning 'at the high mass at 11
o'clock. I A special indulgence will be
granted to" all those who keep the mis
sion. . .' i â¢ â  ? â  .â ' â 
THE CBOMDALE'S HARD LUCK
Her Water Tanks -Are Leaking, So
Her Departure Will Be Delayed.
: The British ship Cromdale is in hard
luck. She was ready to sail a week ago
when it was discovered that her water
tanks were leaking. Repairs were made,
the ship cleared^ at the Custom House
yesterday and the vessel was to have
gone to sea to-day. At the last moment
it was discovered that the tanks were
leaking again, so the vessel will have. to
be docked. It is thought that new tanks
will have to be put in before she can get
away for Liverpool. "

BAR OR NO BAR
FOR OLYMPIC
CLUB MEMBERS
Board Now Consider
ing the Innovation.
BOTH SIDES OF THE MATTER
THE ANTI-BAB PABTY FEABS
THE WOBST.
Those Who Favor . the Scheme Believe
That a Great Advantage would
Be Gained by' Its In
troduction. ;
"Bar or no bar" Is the question which
is agitating the board of directors of the
Olympic Club and many of Its members
at the present time. For many years it |
has been a rule of the Post street ath
letic organization not to allow alcoholic
refreshments of any kind to be sold
within the club, and this regulation has j
been strictly adhered to. . It is very like- ]
ly that in the near future the ancient tra
dition will be erased from the club's code
of house rules and the members be per
mitted to .call j for a cocktail or a bottle
of ale without' having .to forego- the com
forts of an easy chair and engage in cor
ner pedestrianism to obtain the same.
' Many of the members are violently op
posed to the introduction of this inno
vation on the ground that alcoholic stim
ulants should not be sold in an athletic
club. They assert that exercise devel
ops a thirst as well as- muscle and easy
access to the means of satisfying the for
mer will tend to demoralize the younger
element in the club. .They do not fear
.that any.such result would follow the in
troduction of a bar, but the possibility of
it is what makes them halt and op
pose it. â  v.. v
The party which favors . the ' introduc
tion of the bar are also strong, and they
advance what they declare to be an un
answerable . argument. They claim that
a drink in the ( club is a dozen shades
more proper than a rushing to the corner
grocery. They also say it- will promote
good fellowship and sociability. As an
exemplification to. their â¢ argument they
cite tne custom in the big swell Eastern i
athletic clubs, ail of which ' have bar at- i
tachments and which prove of inestima- |
ble value to the. club; on the financial as j
â¢well as the social' side of . its life.
The house committee of. the Olympic
Club has this matter under advisement
and it is expected that- they will propose
the establishment of a bar. F. P. Mc-
Lennan, the chairman of that committee,
said yesterday: â  -â¢ , -- _Â,.....
"I think that , the introduction of a bar
would be" of value â¢to ; the - club, but we
want to consider every phase of the ques
tion before taking a step. < I am not the
sponsor of the proposition, but favor- it
merely. A cozy place, where a man can
invite a friend and' take a drink, is ever
so much better -than a corner grocery
frog shop. It t promotes sociability, i and
cannot see how it â¢ can possibly work '
harm. - The house committee is there to j
see that the privilege should not be i
abused and it 'is unlikely that it 'would i
be." - , ' â¢-'â .. ' -â¢'â  'â¢' -
; The - entire proposition I will be 5 consid
ered at a future meeting of the board.
