NEW VERSION
OF DREYFUS'
CONVICTION
Trapped by Men Into Whose
Secrets He Pried Too
Closely.
GENERAL STAFFS ACT
Officers Who Embezzled Money of
the Secret Service Said to Have
Formed the Conspiracy.
Special Dlspatc"h to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 1. â A special
cable to- the Journal from London says;
If any further Interest can be attached
to the Dreyfus case it will be found in
the explanation publf^hed^ In a London
society paper giving a pew version to
ihe whole affair on the authority ot a
high French official!
This gojr>sÂ° on to say that Dreyfus had
the ill lurk to stumble blindly into the
path of a body of -men who were on
gaged in a- monstrous fraud. These
! men were officers on the -French general
i- staff, which was In "leaguef-to embezzle
j secret service rriraney. The War Office
j spends annually $100,000 in the secret
service. For years? the general staff
was- hopelessly corrupt. It divided
nearly the whole sum' among the offi
cers controlling the espionage depart
ment. It packed the pigeon holes in
the War Office with bogus documents,
for which large sums were supposed to
have been paid.
Dreyfus, having access to the secret .
dossier, began asking the War Office
: searching questions, and it was re
solved to get rid of him. Dreyfus him
self has probably but a glimmering .of
j the reason for his condemnation. He
was a prying, curious person, cager 1 to
obtain information and singularly in
discreet in his methods of obtaining It.
In his pryings into dark holes and
corners of the War Office he got too
warm on the scent of the men who
were diverting the secret service funds
into their own pockets. They thought
he knew more than he did. so they sac
rificed him. Then, when the agitation
I for his release came, they were forced
| to manufacture evidence of his guilt.

AGUINALDO WILL
BECOME A BRIGAND
NEW YORK, April I.â A cable to the
Journal dated Manila, April- 1, 7:45
p. m., says: Scouts of General Mac-
Arthur's division penetrated within a
mile of Calumpit to-day without find
ing the enemy. The natives who have
escaped the lash of Aguinaldo are re
turning to their homes and resuming
their ordinary avocations. A commit
tee of natives has been organized and
is preparing a petition for peace, which
will he presented to the American com
manders, offering full and free submis
sion to America. The war, so far as
it is a war against the Filipino repub
lic, is over. Hereafter it is a contest
against powerful brigands.
Aguinaldo and his forces, greatly re
duced by deaths and disaffection, are
fleeing. to the northeast, driving the na
tive Tagallos before them so far as pos
sible and cheering them with stories
that the Americans are about to offer
terms. They are being dispersed
through the mountains about San Fer
nando and in the province of Nouva
Ecfja, preparatory to a life of brigand
age. Neuva Eciji has a comparativel>
agreeable climate through the rainy
season, and will provide a good base for
raiding expeditions into the lower prov
inces about Manila and Malolos.
The advance of our army to Calumpit
will probably be made to-morrow.
WASHINGTON THINKS
PEACE IS NEAR
NEW YORK. April 1 â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
tHegrnphs: With information showing
that the insurgent army is disorgan
ized, and with the announcement from
General Otis of his intention to con
tinue an active campaign, the authori
ties express themselves as very well
satisfied with the situation in the Phil
ippines. It was reported here this af
ternoon that Aguinaldo had sont repre
sentatives to Manila to treat with the
Philippine Commission, but Acting Sec
retary Meiklejohn, with whom I. talked
to-night, declared the report absolutely
unfounded.
Mr. Meiklejohn expresses the utmost
satisfaction with the condition of af
fairs on the island of Luzon, as re
ported by General Otis, and is confi
dent that within a very short time the
trouble will have ended.
General Otis' instructions to the
troops at Malolos and along the rail
way to proceed on reconnoitering duty
is constriied at the department to mean
that' he is trying to locate any present
bodies of the enemy which may still be
ready for operations,, and should they
be found.lt is Â° expected he' will take
steps to, immediately crush them. So
far he has found, according to his re
port, that the insurgents are only in
small forces in the surrounding terri
tory, but it may be <hat Aguinaldo is
keeping small detachments in the field
while he "is re-forming his army at his
new headquarters.
It would/hot surprise officials to learn
SECRETARY HAY
REBUKES GERMANY
EHBASSADOR WHITE.
NEW YORK, April I.â The Her
aid's Washington correspondent
sends the following: Official in
formation from Samoa show*
that the German Consul General
was at ihe hottom of the recent trou
bio In the islands, resulting in the kill-
Ing >>f an American marine and British
eallors, and culminating in the bom
bardment nf the followers of Mataafa
by American and British warships.
Hrcrotary Hay made public this
unnn an official dispatch from
Rear Admiral Kautz. received by the
Navy Department to-day, and com
municated to the State Department. It
was dated Newcastle. X. R. Ws*. March
30, From this dispatch it Is believed
tho action of Mataafa's followers in at
tacking tho American.' and '.British
guards was the direct result of an in
c^ndiary proclamation issued by the
G"erman Consul General, and that to
this extent the German Government,
through Its representative, is responsi
ble for the attack and for the subse-.
qu'ent bombardment,
Officials of the administration are
much displeased at the action of the
German Consul General, and It is be
lieved that when the German Embas
sador called at the State Department
this afternoon Secretary Hay ac
quainted him with the displeasure of
this Government in rather positive lan-
guage.
I also have reason to believe that the
Secretary told Embassador yon Holle
ben that, pendine the final settlement
of the future "government of the island,
the United States would expert all Ger
man officials in the Island to be gov
erned by the action of the majority of
the Consuls. It is hoped by theÂ«admin
istration that the German Government
will send instructions to the German
Consul and the German naval comman
der which will result in the main
tenance of a modus Vivendi, pending a
final settlement of Samean affairs, by
which the government will be admin
istered by the majority of the Consuls
until Ihp arrival of the High Joint Com
mission representing the three govern
ments, which is to determine the fu
ture government of the islands. As the
American and British Consuls are act
ing In harmony, this would put the gov
ernment into their hands for the time
being, and Mataafa would have to sub
mit to it or make war upon the, two
governments. Officials here do not be
lieve that the German Government
would go to the extent of attempting
to uphold Mataafa by force.
Dissatisfaction is felt at the attitude
of the German Government, as well aa
at the action of the Consul General.
It has been evident for snme time that
the. German Government, while pro
fessing the utmost friendliness, has
been trying to 1 create an Impression
that American and British officials, and
not the- German representatives, have
been responsible for the trouble in Sa
moa. Press dispatches from Berlin,
ntly inspired, speak of "American
explanations." intimating that the
American Government had done some
thing calling for an explanation. They
also intimate that Rear Admiral Kautz
has been reproved from Washington,
thus giving the impression that the
course of the rear admiral was not sat
isfactory to the American Government.
It is, of course, unnecessary to say that
the American Government has not
made any explanations, and that Rear
Admiral Kautz has not been reproved.
A dispatch was sent to Admiral
Kautz yesterday, before his dispatch
was received, directing him tf> preserve
the status quo and avoid, if possible,
any friction with the natives or with
the German Consul. This was in no
sense a censure of the rear admiral.
that the Philippines Commission has
determined to delay the issuance of its
proclamation calling upon the insur
gents to lay down their arms and re
turn to their ordinary vocations and
promising them amnesty and home
rule under the direction of the commis
sion. This proclamation has" been pre- =
pared, and it was the expectation of
whose course is entirely approved.
President McKinley and Secretary
Hay are considering the question or.
who shall be appointed as the Ameri
can member of the High Joint Commis
sion to negotiate as to the future of
the islands. I understand the Presi
dent has several names under consid
eration, but it may be some time be
fore a decision is made, as negotiations
for the commission have not yet been
completed. It is desired that the whol*
matter shall be settled with as little
delay aÂ» possible, and the President
will try to have the American member
of the commission decided upon soon,
so that he will be able to leave for Sa
moa as soon as the. German and British
Commissioner^ shall start.
THE GERMAN PAPERS
UGLY IN TONE
Some Comments Said to Be Inspired
That Do Not Make for
Peace.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press
BERLIN, April I.â The latest devel
opments in the Sam'oan muddle have
claimed the larger part of public at
tention this week. The Government is
most reticent, to the great dissatisfac
tion of the press, and in the absence of
clear information from headquarters
regarding the attitude of the Govern
ment editorial comment is varied and
contradictory. The Agrarian organs
attack the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Baron yon Bulow, and the Government
for yielding over much to the United
States Embassador, Andrew D. White,
and to the authorities at Washington.
The Nationalistic Deutsche Zeitung
says: "Many Germans are disappointed
â¢with the Yon Bulow regime and wish
Marsoheil yon Bieberstein, bad as he
was, back again."
The Kreuz Zeitung say there is
abundant confirmation at hand show
ing it Is not so much the United .States
as Great Britain that has opposed dif
ficulties in front of every stop Germany
has taken or wished to take in Samoa,
and expresses amazement that' "while
Great Britain has attempted^ to "make"
Germ-any believe she was frien-dly,; the
British policy of envy continues." \, s
The Kreuz Zettung adds: "England's
calculations seem to be that Germany
will not risk a conflict over such a
trifle as Samoa. The error of this cal
culation is that our prestige in the
world depends on the maintenance of
our acquired rights. We are -.ready to
agree to a fair compromise, including
the abolition of the condominium. 'Â° Be
yond that wo cannot go."
It is understood that the â foregoing .
was inspired.
Another article in the Kreuz Zeitung
says: "It is shameful that in spite. "of
the paramount German interests. in SaY"
mna Enelish is the only language - of- '
flcially allowed." - . . 'â â ;â¢/' -' â¢! .
The paper then asks the Government
to see, in the negotiations pending,
that Germany is accorded "equal rights
with England. In conclusion the- Kreuz
Zeitung remarks: "'England's success
in Samoa at Germany's cost would be
the worst business England has done
for the last, hundred^ years.".-
The Tageblati expresses confidence
that neither Great Britain nor the
Unitfd States will override legitimate
German rights and- maintains that the
Government -'possesses information to
the effect that' no-such attempt will be
made.
The Cologne Gazette publishes letters

WASHINGTON. April i.â
The ..following was given
Out at the -State Department this
afternoon: The Secretary of
State has received from the Sec
retary of the Xaw a telegram ad
dressed to him by Rear Admiral
Kautz relative to Samoan mat
ters. It is dated. Newcastle,
N. S. \\\. March 30, 1899, and
reads as follows: â -â ..;
"The Mataafa people obeyecl
orders to leave the Government
reservations. Since then they
have become aggressive, killing
Private Holloway and three
British sailors. ( >ur man v killed
was guarding the American con
. sulate. â ;â¢â  ; -. 'â >:â â 'â .'â â 
r "jThe German Consul General
issued, an incendiary .â proclama
tion saying that my proclamation;
-\yas .untrue and that. he. would, up
hold: the provisional gnvernment.
The British forces act in concert
with those ofvthe rnited States,
she.lling rebels -wherever they can
be reached: ','ââ¢â¢'â¢ .â [â '": :''..'
A copy of this dispatch was
sent to the German Embassador.
fel and Herren Fries and Yon Bulow.
The correspondent also claims that the
landing: of the bluejackets and marines
from the British cruiser Porpoise in the
Grevesmuhl affair was injudicious and
calculated to make matters worse. Ac
cording to this correspondent the whole
attitude of the British representatives
was wrong and the rigid non-interfer
ence of the German warship Falke in
the native quarrels was the only cor
rect one.
The Gazette corrects several of the
correspondent's statements, but main
tains that Mr. Chambers' attitude has
been incorrect. {. â¢'â¢'
The general tone of the press, in com
menting upon the recent occurrences,
is one of distrust both of Great Britain
and the United States and their ulti
mate intentions. In this the German
newspapers have seemingly been con
firmed by specials received from the
United -States, all of which assert that
the American press and people desire
a serious encounter with Germany.
The influential Centrist Cologne Volka
Zeitung prints a New York special
warning Germany against the belief
"that the anti-German sentiment pre
vailing in the United States is of small
account." It asserts that war against
Germany is daily preached and "may
lÂ«ad= to deplorable results if the Ameri
can Government does not check this in
time."
The Government semi-official press,
however, remains^ calm and dignified
and, insists that all the mooted pointa
betw=eeri the two nations will be ami
cably adjusted.
Mr. White, upon several occasions
this week, has expressed a like opinion
to the correspondent of the Associated
Press. He repeated that neither the
German nor the United States Govern
ment attached much importance tÂ»
the Samoan imbroglio, and added:
"Throughout I have found the Govern
ment very conciliatory and inclined to
take a r.asonable view of all questions
entering into a final settlement in Sa
moa."
THE ENGLISH PRESS
FAVORS PARTITION
That Is the Only Way to Settle tilÂ©
Samoan Problem Perma
nently.
Cn o p3Tightpd, ISW, by the Associated Press.
â¢ LONDON, April -I.â The Samoan blaze
has been the leading political topic of
the week and tho general drift of the
.press comments has been that the mat
tf will be settled amicably between the
powers'.
The Spectator this week says: "The
Samoan incident looks ugly, but we do
not think it will come to anything.
Under other circumstances the bom
bardment would have produced war,
bi^t as matters stand the three powers
will arrive at an agreement. Let us
hope" that they will divide the islands
for the peace of the world. Any gov
ernment .is better than the condo
minium."
Â° The Saturday Review throws the en
tire blame upon thr- German agents and
declares the bombardment will not
.prove, an unmixed eviMf it finally cm:
viriees Germany of the folly of making
Samoa the "scapegoat of international
jealousies" in the South Pacific."
AUSTRALIAN TROOPS
OFFER THEIR SERVICES
Volunteers Are Anxious to Go and
Fight for Great Britain in
Samoa.
WELLINGTON. N. Z., April I.âBe
lieving the imperial authorities might
need special communication with Sa
moa, the Premier, Mr. R. J. Sodden, has
cabled that the steamer Tutaneka I
will hold herself in readiness at Auck
land to carry dispatches and has of
fered to send a battalion of troops and
volunteers to assist the British .war
ships. The volunteers who are en
camped at Auckland for the Easter ma
neuvers promptly offered their ser
vices.
they have yet had. There is no inten
tion on the part of the administration
to interfere with the commission, and
the President is confident it under
stands the situation much better than
he does.

eral Corbin yesterday. General Otis

with the letting of contracts for supplylnjc'
beef during! tho Spanish war. He had
â¢been .prepared to put -in a bid and pre- j
vious to the oj>oning of the bids had had |
a conference with Geri.' Eagan, who was
a persona] acquaintance and who had j
wired. -for him .to-come to Washington. Mr. '
Simpson said he had in 1897 visited Cuba
ad a- food commissioner for the United
States-, for tho purpose â of investigating ]
tli. Supply of cattle In that country. He
had .Informed- the general that he con
slaered it Impossible to use refrigerator
beef in Cuba, explaining the conditions
and difficulty, and after tho first conver
sation General Bagaii had instructed him \
to remain over one day. The next morn
ing when he called tho general had toid
him that he must purchase refrigerated |
beef for Cuba, but he did not indicate that j
this position was taken at the Instance of ; !
any 'superior olflcer. He (Mr. Simpson) |
had not, therefore, p"t in a bid. He alÂ«o. j
stated that he had more or loss talk with. i
General Eagan and with the agent of
Armour & Co concerning the use of pre
â ervativesi This question was discussed
In a general way. with Mr. Bagan, who |
told him. that some Investigations were i
being conducted in the South in that di
rection. . ll' .had Inferred that the experi- |
ment was mado'in the Interest of both the '
Government and the packers.
Mr. Simpson paid that since that tir~~ '
he had made a l>lÂ«i, which had been ac
cepted, tta Buppiylng beef on the block i
to the inland points in Cuba, aiul that he '
was now engaged in that work, securing
his' cattle from Texas and Venezuela. He
riiso stated that he hnd had considerable
experience in .shipping beef abroad, and
ilia! refrleg^rated beei generally brought
about 2 cents per pound less In the Lon- â

beef, as well as the native It was
necessary, to use the na,tlve. he<>f the day
it was killed to prevent spoiling, and the
refrigerator beef was preferred to the na
tive article. He had found the canned
beef satisfactory in stews and had heard
no complaint concerning it. Typhoid was
the - principal disease, hut there were
many cases of dysentery and diarrhoea.
The latter he attributed generally to the
enting of native fruits and not to the
meats. AJI told, only about 120 cans of
beef had been refused. Some of the re
frigerator beef had to be trimmed.
- Major George "H. Torney. who had
charge of the hospital ship Relief during
the war, said that about 500 sick men had
been transported from the island. He had
never .used canned roast beef. The re
frigerated meat had been tested and had
given satis'factitin. He did not believe any
chemical reserves had been used.

hospitals at theflrst named place and of
the distribution, of the sick. . He said he
heard many complaints from the men and
the surgeons concerning the meat sup

had heard In New York that many of the

beef, but he had' attributed this to the

NEW YORK, April I.â Nine persons
wore severely injured, and it is feared
. t\yo. were drowned in a collision be
tween an ocean-soing tug and one of
the Brooklyn 'ferryboats to-night. The
ferryboat . pierrepont was struck in
midstream by the tug Argus and so
badly damaged that it was with diffi
culty she reached her Brooklyn slip.
The tug was uninjured.
The accident occurred during the
rush hours, when the ferryboat was
crowded, and it is -believed to have been
caused by a misunderstanding of sig
nals and the large amount of traffic
in the stream.
The Argus crashed into the ferryboat,
penetrating the side of the Pierrepont
five feet forward of the entrance to the
women's cabin. There was almost a
panic aboard and in the rush two girls
and a woman were., thrown into the
water. The woman was rescued, but
nothing has been seen of the girls, who
were unknown.
Those injured were mostly women
and they were struck by the broken
timbers near the" women's cabin.
Mrs. Hannah Corinrff was severely in
jured about the back. Mrs.' Anna Heilly ]
received severe injuries of the back and
her right leg was crushed. Mrs. Mary
Meyers had her hand crushed and re
ceived internal injuries. Antonio Aus
tino was severely injured internally.
Those were the most seriously injured.
All live in Brooklyn.

PROSECUTION OF
BAKER'S SLAYERS
Uncle Sam Takes a Hand
in a Lynching.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHARLESTON, S. C. ( April I.âFif
teen prominent citizens of Lake City,
B. Â«'., will be put ori trial here in the :
United States Court next week to an
swer the charge :of having lynched
Postmaster Fraser B. Baker, more than
a year ago. Besides killing the Post
master, who was a negro, the alleged
lynchers will have to; answer for killing
Baker's infant child and for burning
the Lake City Postofnce with all its
effects. . ;; '.
It is said here that other arrests will
be made before the case is taken up.
The indictment will go to the Grand
Jury and the hearing Will begin at
once. Eighty witnesses for the Govern- i
ment have been summoned and there j
Is a great array of witnesses for the j
defense.
This is the first time on record that
the Federal Government has come fato
the South to take up a. lynching trial.
The murder of Baker was probably th>
most bruuil crime' known in the b,iatory
of the State. Baker was -appointed
Postmaster at Lake City, and before he
took charge of the office he was Warned
to keep away. He refused and an at
tempt was made to kill him soon after
his commission was received. This
failed and then a regular band was or
ganized to put him out of the way.
The defendants in this celebrated case
are Ezra Mcknight, W. A. Webster, A.
V. Ward, Moultrie Epps, H. C. Godwin,
C. J. Joiner, Oscar Kelly, Edwin Rodg
ers, Alonzo Rodgers, Henry Stokes,
Allen Belk, Van Somerford, E. P. Lee,
J; P. Newham and Marion Clark. They
are representative business men from
the Lake City section. Marion Clark
was f ormerly the editor of a newspaper
In that town. Stokes was a deputy
United States marshal in Georgia some
years ago, and the other prisoners are
merchants and farmers.
According to the testimony given at
the preliminary hearing by Newham
and Lee, who turned State's evidence,
the Lake City band of lynchers was
organized for the Hi>ectal purpose of
killing Baker. ThÂ» negro had refused
to leave town and give up the office.
The white people rebelled at the Idea
of a colored postmaster.

THE OLD WAY
Of Treating Dyspepsia and Indiges-
tion by Dieting a Dangerous
and Useless One.
We say the old way, but really it Is
a very common one at present time and
many dyspeptics and physicians as
well consider the first step to take in
attempting to cure indigestion is to
I diet, either by selecting certain foods
i and rejecting others or to greatly di-
minish the quantity usually taken, in
! other words, the starvation plan is by
many supposed to be the first essential.
The almost certain failure of the star-
vation cure for dyspepsia has been
! proven time and again, but still the
moment dyspepsia makes its appear-
ance a course of dieting is at once ad-
vised.
All this is radically wrong. It Is fool-
i ish and unscientific to recommend dlet-
j ing or to a man suffering
I from dyspepsia, because indigestion
itself, starved every organ and every
ner,ve and eve>"y fiber, in the body.
\Vllat_3 the dyspeptic wants is abund-
ant, nutrition, which means plenty of
goad, wholesome, well cooked food and
something to assist the weak stomach
to digest \\. % This is exactly the pur-
pose for which Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets are adapted and this is the method
by whi<lh they tmre the worst cases of
I dyspepsia, in other words the patient
1 eats plenty odf wholesome food and
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets digest it
! fop him. In this wa c y the system is
nourished and the overworked stamach
i rested, 'Jbedatise" the tablets will digest
I the food whether the stomach works
[or not. One -of these tÂ°abiets will digest
3000 grains of meat or^eggs.
Your druggist will JteliÂ° c you that
I Stuart's Dyspepsia is the
purest and safest remedy for stomach
troubles and every trial makes one
more friend for this excellent prepara=
tlon. Sold at. 50 cents fforr r fult-sized

8pÂ«clal Dispatch to. The Call.
: ; NEVADA CITY, April I.â Robert
Gates, the barber who was the only
eye-witness of the murder of Policeman
Kilroy by Ed H. Moore yesterday, is
in trepidation lest some of Moore's
friends attempt ta : make way with
him. He knows that if the murderer
is caught and brought back it is his
evidence which, "will directly and effect
ually fasten the crime upon him, and
that If he were silenced there might he
gome room for doubt. Gates and the
officers know Moore had a few friends
of his own kind here and" there, ' and
while the latterdo not. have the hardU
hood to come out openjy. and express
sympathy for the . fu-gritfve, lest the
wrath of the populace which has been
stirred to boiling pitch apainst Moore
be transferred to them; it. is more than
half suspected that some of them are
none too good to /resort to the use of
knife or pistol to save Moore's neck, if
by doing so. they would not endanger
their own. '
At the inquest this afternoon there
were, ten witnesses, but it was mainly
the testimony .of Gates that led to a
flat-fo.oted verdict that Moore mur
dered Kilf.oy with, a .-pistol. Gates saw
everything from bohirid . an electric
tieht pole just across the]: street:. He
heard the men talking: quietly at first,
.but. what they, were Baying he was too
deaf to understand. Then they raised
their voices and he saw Kilroy take
Moore by the shoulders, heard the Lat
ter say he would kill the' officer at any

Be Enlarged to a Capacity
of Five Thaisand Horse-
Power.
P;Â«i<-ial Dispatch to The Call.
SAi'IiAMKNTO. April I.â A deal was
ummated here to-day which is of
much tmportance to this city and sur
rounding towns, 'l'h. Sacramento Elec
tric, Gas ami Railway Company, which
has it power house at Folsom, lias made
a contract for thirty years with the
fuba Electric Power Company for the
isive use of 5000 horse-power, to be

Sacramento company in this city. This
will place at the disposal of the Sacra
mento company lO,C horse-power with
its own and enable it to supply manu
facturers with all the power they may
need, the price being very low and a
greal reduction from the cost of steam
pow.r, and the charge for electric light
being less than one-half the prices
charged i" the other principal cities of
the Pa< Ific < "oast.
The result has been that Sacramento
to-day may l>" justly termed "an elec
trical city." th" capacity of the existing
transmission plant from Folsom hav
ing been fully absorbed in this mar
ket .
Recognizing this fact, the persons
controlling the Sacramento Electric.
Gas and Railway Company, which is
the owner <>f the transmission plant
from Foisom, is now perfecting plans
for the augmentation of the electric
energy available for Sacramento City.
Its works at Foisom, wherein are how
installed 4000 horse-power, have a va
cancy for a fifth unit of 1000 horse
power, which will now be installed,
makinp the works of 5000 horse-power

that lx ith com.pan.ies mutually share in
the benefits to be derived from thÂ» in
â â l demand for power. Deliveries
in Sacramento will commence on thj

Special Cable to The am! the New York

don Bennett.
PARIS, April l.âln the Chamber of
Deputies there was on Wednesday a
cheerful interlude in the tedious battle
door and shuttlecock of the budgetary
millions.
The subject of the debate was, "Shall
the French Government go into the ad
vertising business," and it came about
in this way: The Minister of Finance,
weighed down by the burdep of an
ever-increasing deficit, cast covetous
glances on the covers of matchboxes.
Everybody, probably, has suffered at
one time or another in life from the
French match. It is dear and nasty,
and the legend that it strikes only on
the box Is an empty boast, the truth
being that it will not strike anywhere.
The reason for its otherwise mysterious
existence lies in the fact that It is a
Government monopoly and brings in
millions to the state.
Having made these out of the inside
of the boxes, M. Peytral had a bril
liant idea of utilizing the outside of
| 800.000,000 boxes per annum. It Is pub
licity such as would make the mouth
of proprietors of so and so soap and
somebody else's chocolate water ac
i cordingly.
Application was made to Parliament
for necessary powers, and this raised j
a storm. Certain old-fashioned mem- j
I bers looked on the scheme as beneath i
'â  the dignity of the nation. One sarcas- j
I tic legislator wanted to know where
the Government intended to stop, and
proposed letting out the column of the
Vendome in convenient squares, or the
establishment <>f flashlight puffing pills
on Eiffel Tower. Hut the solid five mil
lions which the scheme would bring in
was M. Peytral'a strong argument and
won the day.

NEW TERROR FOR THE
DOCTORS IN X RAYS
Applied to a Paris Woman They
Cause a Peculiar Malady and a
Suit for Damages.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Heraia. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
flon Bennett.
PARIS, April Lâ X rays are doubtless
a benefit to humanity, but in their latest
public appearance they forma new terror
for medical men. A Paris doctor recently
had occasion to use them on a lady pa
tient. He gave her three long exposures
to them and took three successful photo
graphs, but he reckoned without the del
irate skin of the patient. The X rays pro
duced irritation, acute inflammation set
in and after six months' suffering such
as led her friends to fear for her reason
the lady was only fairly convalescent.
She brought action against her medical
adviser for 5000 francs damages, repre
senting her expenditure for live medical
authorities called in and traveling ex
penses in search of relief from her suf
fering. The tribunal was completely puz
zled by the novel claim, and has taken
the matter under advlseVnent.
Grain Crops Thriving.
WOODLAND, April I.â Farmers who
have been in the busings a long time
inform The Call correspondent that in
all their experience they have never
known conditions more favorable than at
present. In the first place, the area sown
to wheat is as large and perhaps larger
than usual. In the next place, there has
been ample rain to insure good crops on
all qualities of grain land in Yolo County,
providing there is not more than the
usual amount of hot north wind while the
wheat Is in the milk and that there is a
normal amount of spring showers. Here
tofore when crops were good on the high
lands they were poor in the tule district,
and vice versa. This year, unless there
should be extraordinary rains during this
month and May., there will be big crops
on the tule lands, while nothing short of
a calamity can prevent an abundant yield
on the high lands.

IS A LOVE MATCH
PURE AND SIMPLE
Father Murphy Speaks
of Coming Nuptials.
LIKES YOUNG VANDERBILT
AND HAS KNOWN MISS FAIR
SINCE HER SCHOOL DAYS.
Says Her Charities Have Been Many
and Varied, but Is Non-Com
mittal Concerning Fu
ture Gifts.
fiEPctal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April I.â When Miss
Virginia Fair plights her troth ta Wil
liam K. Vanderbilt Jr. at high noon of
j Tuesday next her mind will irresistibly
j revert to the days of her schoolgirl
hood, for the solemn marriage ser
vice of the Roman Catholic church,
Which will seal the alliance between
' the houses of Vanderbilt and Fair, will
be read by the Rev. Thomas Francis
Murphy, who was Miss Fair's father
confessor during her schooldays.
It is in accordance with the personal
request of the bride-to-be that Father
Murphy will celebrate the nuptials.
The young heiress and priest are
friends of long standing.
When asked to-day if Miss Fair pro
posed giving some $50,000 or $100,000 to
Catholic charities before becoming Mrs.
Vanderbilt or on her wedding-day,
Father Murphy replied, "I have read
Bucta reports."
"Hut is it true of your own knowl
edge?" was asked.
'"I have read such reports," reiterated
Father Murphy, "krat I am not in a
position to say anything concerning ;
Miss Fair's purposes in the matter. Her
charities have been many and varied,
and it is not beyond the possible â ."
Father Murphy rhecked himself and
smiled benignly upon his interviewer.
That the Vanderbilt-Fair alliance is
a love match pure and simple Father
Murphy is firmly convinced.
"Each <>f the young people have all
of this world's goods that either could i
possibly need or desire," he said, "and
the two have been drawn to each other
by all that is best in each."
During the carrying out of certain
details prior to the ceremony the priest j
came into persona] relationship with
young Mr. Vanderbilt. He was very
rably impressed with the young
millionaire, and it is largely upon the
impressions then gained that Father
Murphy predicts happiness for both
parties to the compact.
"In general th>> marriage of a Cath- I
olic," he said, "with one outside of the !
church should not be, but when one !
party to the contract is whole-souled j
and earnest in his or her allegiance to
the church great good may attend the
match."
ENGLAND'S CONSERVATISM

His System.

LONDON. April I.â Another instance of
London's conservatism is found in Signer
Marconi's disappointment in that up to
the present time he has received very lit
tle encouragement in England of his sys
tem of wireless tel( graphy. After a long
time spent in endeavoring to secure the
support of England he has only now
reached a point where some official ri
nition is being given to ni.s experiments.,
whereas France is very eagerly embrac
ing the opiÂ»rtunity to experiment with
bis system.
The Pall Mall Gazette points out that
one possible drawback of wireless teleg
raphy will be the possibility ot tapping
the current and thws destroying the se
crecy of the message.
BERLIN, April 1.-Electricity is mak
ing great strides in this country. The
Kaiser, through Professor Slabe, keeps
informed on every new discovery. He
shows special interest in the wireless tele
granh, which he hopes to use on his
yacht. It Is understood that he will try
experiments when ho visits England.
THE RELIGICUS WAR
SPREADS IN ENGLAND
Lively Scenes in Two Liverpool
Churches During the Celebra
tions on Palm Sunday.
Special "'able to The Call and thr NVw York

LONDON, April I.â The religious war,
which goes on with undiminishrd vigor,
has now spread to, [Liverpool, where live
ly scenes took place in a number of Prot
estant churches on Palm Sunday fur tin
first time. The services wire preceded by
processions with palms. When the bodies
of anti-ritualists rose up antl protested i:i
the two churches the ringleaders were
arrested and led off to Jail, while others
were proceeded against by summons. All
last Sunday Liverpool was in a ferment,
the anti-ritualist Leaders striving their ut
most to stir up an agitation against what
they called idolatry in the Church of
England.
Meanwhile, the Roman Catholics are
manifesting their delight because the
Church of England is drawing closer to
the Church of Rome in methods of wor
ship. Religious intolerance is being car
ried so far that Catholic literature is be
ing banished from certain suburban li
braries in London.

of General Shafters puck trains. He

some time last November his letters

Pearson left . Santiago on December 3
for the United States. The second day out
he was attacked with yellow fever. Off
San Jean a quarantine officer boarded the
ship and Pearson was taken on a sailboat
to a small island two miles from the city.
He complains that during his long Illness
no Americans visited him and no Amer
ican nurses could bo induced to attend a
yellow fever hospital. He will not return
to the United States until summer, as his
physicians say he could not withstand the
climate in his present enfeebled condition.

LITTLE IS DONE
IN PARLIAMENT
Ministry Has No Cause
for Congratulation.
Copyrighted, 1539, by the Associated Press.
I.oNDON, April I.â The first section
of the Parliamentary session termi
nated with the adjournment for the
Easter recess, and up to now the Minls^
ters cannot boast of any remarkable
achievement. The chief event was the
reading of the London local government
bill for the second time, but as the bill
will receive most attention when it en
ters the committee stage the Govern
ment has no reason for self-congratu
lation, especially as its own supporters
as well as the opposition are demanding
important modifications.
The bill of the Secretary of State for
the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, to
facilitate the acquirement of dwellings
by workmen, has fallen Hat, as every
thing depends on the permission of the
landlords.
The first matter of importance on the j
Commons reassembling will be the j
budget, which has' been fixed for Thurs- |
day week.
The well-known French painter, Aime ]
Nicolas Merot, who has just returned to i
France from Abyssinia, tells a pitiful !
tale of th? manner in which he was
treated by the Abyssinians and of his i
disappointment over the loss of French ;
prestige. He says a very wrong idea
obtains in France regarding the influ- ,
ence enjoyed by Frenchmen in Abys- j
sinla. He claims Frenchmen are ppÂ«- ;
temptuously looked down upon and* re
regarded as less than nothing, iÂ»hile
the British, on the contrary, are beared j
arid respected. He concludes: "From ,
what I have seen I am persuaded the.
English will soon become piasters of ;
Abyssinia, just as they have of Egypt.
This is the inevitable."
Holy Week in Spain was celebrated ;
with more than usual religious splen
dor, the Queen Regent, who is uli'.a-
Cathbjie, and the Cabinet giving fresh
propflj of their desire to conciliate the
Vatican and the prelates who so suc
cessfully assisted the Government in
checking the Car-list Intrigues. Conse
quently the Madrid churches yesterday
were visited by thousands, all traffic I
was suspended arid aH ttie women wore
rhantiUas. ,
At Sevilfe yesterday* while a proces
sion was carrying the famous ima^ge of.
the Virgin, dressed in the most expen
sive silks and velvets arid wearing 150,
--000 pesetas worth of jewels, the image'
caught lire and \vas completely destroy
ed Most of the jewels Were recovered.
The spectator this week publishes a
very interesting review of Ameri
canism and the papacy, analyzing the
situation developed by the Pope's letter
and Cardinal Gibbons' reply and
sketching the future outlook. It says-:
"We may take it that for the present
Ajnericanism has. received a' setback
and. that the authority of t.We papacy
is re-established in th:e Ignited States."'
â¢Reviewing the Hecker dispute .ah : d the
controversy over the- endowment of
Catholic Institutions, the Spectator j
j saysi " "The diplomatic wisdom of the
[ Pope is usually a powerful element in '
preventing a serious- misunderstanding
between the Vatican ; arid.' the United
Siates. Whether the Feiil. sympathies
of the Pope are republican; or-flut, it i 3
clear that he judged itfpplitie to be on
good terms with the w.orkl's. two great
republics. Whether the! triumph of
Rome in Americanism.' is "permanent or
whether the papal Claims .Will lead to
a serious breach in the American
.church, will depend greatly upon the
next pontiff. Catholicism sits very
lightly upon thousands :of American
'Catholic laymen. 'They do not want to
quarrel with: the priest or break with
the church.but neither will they aban
don the domestic liberties they have
wim, neither will they escape the at
mosphere of liberty in which they live."
F. F. Nisbit, the dramatic critic of
the Times and the writer of the '"Hand
book" in the "Referee, is dead.
Mrs. Gladstone is ill, but it is hoped
her illness is not of a serious nature.

SAX JQSE, April Lâ The stockholders
of the .Union Savings Bank have almost
abandoned ihe idea of ousting James

rights in the Gandu country, around
Lake Tchad and in Kano and Kokoto,
are infringed.
Several" papers take up the cry and
announce interpellations on the subject
when the Reichstag reassembles.
The Socialist party is being disrupted
internally in consequence of a book
written by Herr Bernstein, one of its
chief intellectual leaders, recently pub
lished, in which the fundamental doc
trine that the poor .are constantly be
coming poorer and that capital is be
coming more and more concentrated, is
strikingly disproved. The Socialistic
press admit that if the claim is correct,
tho fundamental doctrine of the party
is demolished.. but the Socialist papers
neither admit nor deny the truth <>f
the allegations. The non-Socialistic
preps, on the other hand, point out that
one by one the Socialist doctrines have'
shown their fallacies and if left alone
the Socialist party will go to pieces.
Hcrr Bebel announced at a Socialist
meeting at Jena this week that â¢ if the
party splits, which he considers likely,

Official figures referring to Germany's
foreign trade for February ?how that

The Hanover Courier published a se

steaming qualities of the new home

tention. It mentions particularly the
recently finished Kaiser Friedrich 111,
the Bertha and the Gazelle, asserting
that their boilers are useless and are
being replaced. The writer of the ar
ticle gives specific proof of his state
ments and furnishes details on the sub
ject.
The so-called anti-strike bill, which
has been officially dubbed "the bill to
protect those who are willing to work,"
fn which the Emneror is strongly in
terested, is at last ready for introduc
tion in the Reichstag soon after the
holidays.

object of securing: a reduction of the
present enormous duty of thirty marks
per hundred weight, which, it Is
claimed, is almost equal to the value
of the goods themselves. Mr. Jacobs
claims that if the duty is reduced a
large trade in California canned fruit
can be done with Germany. Mr. White
informed him that the only hope for
reduction in the duty was in the re
ciprocity negotiations now in progress
at Washington.

BAKERSFIELD, April I.â The Southern

For some time the enterprise has been
in contemplation. To-day a Southern Pa

contracts. The Kern County Land Com
pany and local capitalists have been en
couraging the proposition. The real ob

depth of ninety feet. It yielded fifty bar

The road will pierce the richest grain

It is hinted the Southern Pacific is hurry

that there was na distinction between a

was> the husband's duty to protect his

EASTER DOY.
THE total number of orthodox Christians in the
world has been closely estimated at 477,080,158.
To every one of these persons nominally, and to
most of them actually, the Resurrection is a fact, ac
cepted by them as established by incontrovertible :
evidence, which also proves the immortality of in
dividualized life, and thus furnishes inexpressible I
consolation for the struggles, the pain, the separa- |
tions, the disappointments, under which from the j
beginning of time mankind has groaned. If to this
enormous mass of human beings we add the total :
number who have lived and died in the same belief 1
since the dawn of the Christian era, the whole con- |
stitutes such a demonstration of faith, such a manU â¢
festation of what Mr. Gladstone called "the influence j
of authority in matters of opinion," as renders Easter !
a central point in history and reduces materialism in
all its forms to an insignificant factor in civilization, j
It is not for a secular newspaper to discuss the theo- j
logical aspects of this festival, but some of its phases I
are oi universal interest and importance. From the
earliest records of the human race it is apparent that
the law of contrast, the opposing elements and forces '
let loose in the world, visible and invisible, have de
tntnded explanation and solution. Light and dark
ness, heat and cold, storm and ca,lm, and other similar
natural phenomena, each of which was obviously es- ;
sentia] to the comprehension of the other, were ex
plicable to the simplest mind. But the mysteries of j
good and evil, the successes of .wickedness, the fail
ures of virtue, the inroads of disea.se, the poignant
tortures that were the accompaniments of developed
intellect and sensibility, the brevity of those close
telationships of which love was the cement, wrought
humanity into an intolerable doubt, fear and anguish
that, from within itself, was beyond relief. There ;
: seemed to be a necessity for a prolongation of life
beyond the grave to rectify apparent injustice and to
supply compensations for misery and for failure.
Thus out <n*indi\ idual experiences and reflection the
world was prepared for the doctrine of the resurreo
tion. It has been sometimes claimed that the Old J
iment does not refer to the perpetuation of
human life, but there, as in secular and contem
poraneous literature, this aspiration of man is ex- '
pressed and its truth declared and illustrated. Ccn- j
tin ios after their death it is recorded that the divine
proclamation was issued, fraught with the assurance
of immortality. "I am the God of Abraham, and the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." When Job;
w.is in the depth of his agony he is accredited with
saying, "And though after my skin worms destroy
this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God." Isaiah,
in his majestic phrase, gave the same assurance â
"The dead men shall live; together with my body
shall they arise." Habakkuk, in his impressive me
morial, some passages in which are the climax of
eloquence, tersely expressed "the desire of nations"
in the declaration, "We shall not die." David, stung
with grief while his child was in mortal agony, ceased
to mourn when he was dead, and said. "I shall go to i
him, but he shall not return to me." Of Elijah it is
related that he accomplished the work of raising
from the dead for the widow of Zarephath. "The .
soul of the child came into him again and he re
vived." A similar miraculous resuscitation is at
tributed to Elisha in the case of the child of the
Shunamite.
. These references arc made in this place not es
pecially because they are found in the Rible, but for
the reason that they gather up and enforce the au
to the deepest problems to which the intellect
and the heart of the race were attracted. It was on ,
these lines that the education of the world advanced
toward the higher civilization that the festival of
Easter emblazons. Relief in the individualized im
mortality of the human soul is not monopolized by
Christianity, but it is there formulated into the speci- .
fiv. doctrine of the Resurrection, which is common to
all orthodox believers, however discordant on other
points. When Paul confronted King Agrippa lie in
quired. "Why should it be thought a thing incredible
with you that God should rai>e the dead?" And in
order to show the pivotal importance of the Easter
conception to the higher life of man. both spiritual
and intellectual, he wrote that unequaied chapter in
his First Epistle to the Corinthians, in which he con
centrated his underlying thought in the question. "If
after the manner of meji I have fought with beasts at
Ephcsus, what advantagetfl it ir.c if the dead rise
not?" and. as the alternative to his faith, reproduced
the language of Isaiah. "Let us eat and drink, for to
morrow we die ."
In its practical influence upon human progress and '
upon advancing civilization Easter is the festival of
festivals. It meets the deepest ncce.->ities of man.
It lifts him above himself and into the faithful recog
nition of responsibilities and duties that distinguish
him from all other forms of organic life. It leads him
to the embrace of an aspiring fraternity. It sancti
fies the domestic affections and assures him that death
is but temporary separation and that reunion with
those who have reached his heart on earth is not a
delusion but a certainty. It aspires to him the growth
and the identity of his own soul, protects him against
the most virulent evils that assail him, and fits him
for the future that prophet, sage a:;d martyr have an
ticrprtted tor him.
Easter is set as a jewel in the bosom of spring. It
is surrounded by analogies which strengthen the con
victions th.it it typifies. Nature is resurrected from
the death of winter, and the springing grass, the
protruding bud. the timed flower, attest the univer
sality of life and that the lapse of vitality is but a pro- ;
cess of quickening -and of reorganization. There is an ;
Irish legend that on Easter morning the sun dances
in the sky, and it is certain that wherever the har
monious chimes oi this mighty tribute to eternity are ,
heard light and warmth touch the human heart to!
finer issues and to a nobler ambition.
CRITICISM AND PROGRESS.
IZ^ROM the London Chronicle we learn that the
Birmingham City Council recently conferred the
freedom of the city upon Mr. John Thackray
Bunce. .who has just retired from the editorship ol
the Birmingham Daily Post after a service of thirty
seven years. The Lord Mayor, in proposing the
resolution, stated that the Council recognized that the
progress oi the municipality was due in a large tv.
ure to the judicious criticism Mr. Runce had unspar
ingly shown in his journal.
The item is of some interest as an illustraiion of
the relations which exist in Great Britain between the
press and public officials, but its chief value is the
statement of the recognition of the service which un
fcftering newspaper criticism renders to municipal
ress. The relations between the press and
municipal authorities are not the same here U in
England, but the service oi the press is essentially the
same in both countries.
It is not at all likely that we shall soon see in the
Vnitcd States any incident parallel to that of the Bir
mingham Council. As a rule our municipal officials
are not capable of appreciating the value of the criti
cism to which their acts are subjected, and even when
they, are conscious oi its usefulness ihey rarely have

manliness enough to admit it, much less to corrimend
it. Fortunately the effectiveness of the service is not
dependent upon official acknowledgment. The press
docs its work, and whether that work be approved or
denounced, it adds its strength to the forces which
tend to municipal improvement.
The critic is too often regarded as a mere fault
finder. It would be more accurate to regard him as
a truth-finder, since it is his task to weigh all things
and seek out what is for the true welfare of the com
munity. If a city lacked the testing power of an un
sparing criticism it would be exposed to a thousand
shams in the garb of reform and a thousand jobs
bearing the specious guise of improvements. It would
make no progress, because its energies would be
wasted in a hundred devious channels instead of be
ing directed along the one channel in which real
progress is possible.
It would hardly be an overstatement to say that
criticism and progress are inseparable. Where criti
cism exists and is free there nrnst be progress, since
its stimulus, incessantly applied to officials and to citi
zens .alike, renders stagnation impossible in a com
munity possessing any faculties of activity at all. On
the other hand, it is doubtful if there would be any
notable progress in a community lacking in criticism,
since the natural inertia of men in office would cause
Ihem to rest content with their- salaries in idleness
forever unless some power forced them to action.
Taking all things into consideration, the Birming
ham Council did well in conferring the freedom of
their city upon the unsparing critic of thirty-seven
years' service. It is safe to say the honor has been
conferred upon many a military hero or national
statesman who was less worthy of it. The service of
an editor is not of the kind that officials generally like
to admit, but there is scarcely a city anywhere in the
United States of which it might not be said that its
municipal progress is in a large measure due to the
unsparing criticism of its local press.
MORE EXPLANATION DEMANDED.
OUR esteemed contemporary, the Examiner,
answers our question with reference to its
leadership in the last campaign by saying that
had The Call united with it in promoting Democratic
success Judge Maguire would now be Governor, a
Democrat. would be comfortably installed in the Fed
eral Senate. Mr. Huntington would not be in control
of the Railroad Commission, and Governor Gage
would not possess the power to drag the government
down to the Burns level by manipulating the patron
age of State and city.
All this may be true, but will our contemporary pur
sue the subject a trifle further and tell us what good
would have been accomplished had the government
been given this political complexion? What did the
late Democratic Railroad Commission do toward set-
tling the transportation problem's of the common
wealth? True, it is alleged that it caused Mr. Hun
tington to depart hurriedly from the State, but what
good did that accomplish? Mr. Huntington has re
turned, as fresh and chipper as ever. The late com
mission did not reduce rates of transportation, or
ameliorate any of the evils incident to railroading in
California. Being at loggerheads with the Southern
Pacific, it could not. even secure for shippers the or
dinary courtesies which are always granted to a com
mission friendly in character.
So far as Judge Maguire goes, we are not prepared
to say that he would have been any improvement
upon Mr. Gage. Maguire is a patronage cormorant,
and his head is filled with "reform" ideas which are
more or less disconcerting. We believe, and have al
ways said, that as men go Judge Maguire is honest,
but we do not believe that politically he is sincere, or
that if he were Governor he would even attempt to
redeem many of his extravagant platform promises.
He would simply sit down, as most Governors do,
and figure upon getting as many places for his friends
as possible, without reference to the interests of the
taxpayers.
However, political parties are judged by their
records. Will our contemporary point out to us any
thing accomplished by the local administration which
preceded the present one of a substantial or lasting
tharactcr. The city government was absolutely the
worst we have had for ages, and it was entirely Demo
cratic. The State government was fairly well con
ducted, but we beg to remind our contemporary that,
with the exception of the Governor, it was Republi
can. At the present time we are not prepared to ad
mit that a Democratic Senator at Washington would
be an improvement upon no Senator at all.
PARTIES TO BURN.
\A R. J. STERLING MORTON, by way of
/ \ showing that the conservatism of Nebraska
* * can be as woolry as the radicalism of Kansas,
proposes to organize a new party. It is his opinion
that the time is ripe for a wholesale departure of good
citizens from the old parties. He is quoted as having
said in a recent interview:
"The late war and its momentous issues: the strug
gle of the two great parties over bimetallism; the rise,
decline and absolute decay of Populism â all these
elements contribute to a situation as pregnant as
those which gave birth to the Republican party on
the approach of our civil strife. My investigation
teaches me that the time is ripe-. I do not care to
pose particularly as the head of the new movement,
therefore I will not at the present go into details.
But I will say before July 4 a call will be issued out
lining the plan and it will be signed by men of na
tional fame and of tried politfca! worth."
While Mr. Morton, exhaling the odors of em
balmed Clevelandism. is thus rallying the hosts of a
moribund conservatism. Mr. Pingree of Michigan,
who plays Populist variations on Republican har
monies.- is sweating the collar of him to organize a
new party on progressive lines.
Furthermore, a set of New England men eminent in
Boston. Duxbury and towns of that kind, propose to
organize still another party, being fully persuaded,
like Morton and Pingree. that existing organizations
are inadequate to the political needs of the time and
ol the people. This movement is headed by Edward
E. Hale, and its object is to extinguish the war spirit
of the people, establish international arbitration and
uphold the hands oi the milk-white Czar at the com
ing peace conference which that imperial friend of
humanity called for just before he decided to crush
Finland.
Here. then, are three novelties in the way of po
litical organizations to be put upon the market dur
! ing the coming summer. Each of them comes well
recommended, and is designed to fill the yearning
void of a long-felt want. Of 1 course the good old
parties will continue in the field long enough at least
to welcome the new comers and invite then} to come
nut of the wet and be taken in. We shall then, have
to help in the celebration of this Fourth of July Re
publicans. Democrats. Populists, Gold Democrats.
Socialists. Labormen. Woman Suffragists. Prohibi
tionists. Mortonites. Pingreeites and Haleitesâ and
the next day it will not snow, for it is going to be a

It is' with great interest I have read
"McTeague.". While the book is not by
any means the great American novel,
as an enthusiastic' critic has pronounced
it, it is rich in promise. Frank Norris
of this city is the author. : I predict
that he has just started upon a career
that will bring to him honor and fame.
A criticism of- the book would be out
of place in this column, and anyhow I
have not time to do the subject justice.
Enough to * say that as "a character
study "McTeague" is great. The only
question arising is as to whether the
characters so minutely portrayed are
worth the trouble.' After carefully read
ing the book I am convinced that they
are worth it. There are touches of
tragedy, too, suggesting a DLckens, that
grand old writeF, deemed by the new
school out of date, but far more- valu
able to the world of literature than all

"McTeague" gives it an added 'interest
here, while in no measure, detracting
from its interest to readers elsewhere.

Among the Americans who make ado
Lover their desire that the FiliDinos be

that $1 a day isÂ» enough for any man to

Carnegie and Atkinson are not a pair
of frauds then rotten meat is whole

on the list. He is a pot-bellied Bos

the IJnion Pacific until he ran it into

out of its service. The three make up
a precious trio. I suggest that if they

In this paper a week ago there was a
portrait and a sketch of Hetty Green,
supposedly the richest woman in Amer
ica. The face, taken apart from the
title line and the subject matter, would
be adjudged that of a criminal, in all
likelihood that of a woman who after
an ignoble career was ending her days
in the almshouse. Yet in one sense
Mrs. Green is not a criminal. She
prizes a dollar above her soul, but this
indicates simply a nice appreciation of
values, for the soul peering from that
face would be dear at 40 cents. There
is nothing feminine in the hard lines of
her countenance, nothing gentle nor
sweet. More attractive "mugs" adorn
every rogues' gallery in the land. It
is not strange that this should be so,
for I never knew of a criminal meaner,
smaller or more contemptible than this
deadbeat millionairess, who declines to
pay her taxes, to dress decently, or to
live after the fashion of the civilized.
Doubtless divine wisdom knows what
Hetty Green is for, and so it might ac
count for the existence of snakes, but
to my humble understanding she cum
bers the earth. I would like to see her
useless fortune scattered to the four
winds; mayhap a portion' of it would
fall into worthy hands.

tion other than the Incurring of in

submitted."
The public parks act (Statutes ISS9,
p. 361), under which the bonds for the
purchase for the so-called panhandle
extension must be issued, if at all.
does not contain such a provision as
that quoted above.
It follows that if both questions of
bondings for general Improvements.
such as sewers and schoolhouses and
for the extension of the park, were
submitted to the people at the same
election the validity of such election
as to the sewer and schoolhouse bonds
would be at least doubtful. I there
fore advise that both questions can
not be submitted at the same election.
In accordance with your further re
quest I have drafted a form of or
dinance which is herewith submitted,
with respect to the same. I beg to
bring your attention to the follow
ing considerations:
1. The ordinance, in accordance with
your resolution of intention (No. 2462,
fourth Berles) does not include inter
vening streets. If it is your purpose
to exercise your power as to condem
nation over these or any of them a
new resolution of intention should be
passed and the ordinance made to
conform.
2. Whether the board has or has not
the right to specify what kind of
such bonds shall be payable in
is an open question, there being no
T'nited States Supreme Court decision
thereon, and the State decision being
conflicting. (Bee Murphy vs. City of
Pan Luis Obispo, 199 Cal., 624 and 627.)
[1 would Beem wise, therefore, to omit
all reference to the kind of money in
which such bonds shall be payable.
the statute under which the proceed
ings are to be taken being silent on
the subject.
3. The public parks act, under which
you are proceeding in this matter,
places the authority for calling the
election with the Board of Supervis
ors. But inasmuch as the act creating
the Board of Election Commissioners
expressly transfers from the Super
visor? to the Election Commissioners
all authority for calling ajul conduct
ing elections in this city and county I
would suggest, to prevent later ques
tioning, that all the actions of the
Board of Supervisors with regard to
'ling of such election should be
duplicated in form and substance by
the Hoard of Election Commissioners.
Respectfully.

RELIEF FOR PITIABLE
WARDS OF THE CITY
-
Supervisors Will Recommend New Buildings to
Replace the Pesthouse.
Committee of Investigation Views the Horrors of This Abiding-Place of
Lepers.
TH>C Supervisors will take the first
steps at their meeting to-morrow
to relieve the awful distress of the
wards of the city at the Pesthouse,
that abiding place of the most sorely,
afflicted of all things human.
Supervisors Holland, Attridge, Algel
tinper and Kalbeii, representinp both
the Building: and the Hospital com
mittees of the board, visited the place
yosterday. They turned away Rick at
heart at the misery of the unfortu
quartered there, and resolved to
grant them such relief as was in their
power. They saw the buildings when
the sun was shining brightly, but the
marks of the storm king were visible
on every hand. The recent rain burst
throuph the meager covering afforded
by the weather-beaten roof and left
its mark on the walls, ceilings and
flours. No matter where the Investi
gators turned, they found staring at
them eyes dulled by the most loath

BLACKMAIL
CHARGED BY
J.F. TURNER
Round Half Million
Liberty's Price.
DETECTIVE LUCAS ACCUSED
ALLEGED THAT HE FATHERED
A BIG CONSPIRACY.
Suit Is Brought in the Superior
Court to Declare His Claims
False, Fraudulent and
Void.
Albert E. Lucas, someflmes known aa
A. J. Lucas, a detective, over whose
headquarters on Market street kaleido-
Bcopic lights gleam to attract the atten
| tion of the passing pedestrian, and Clar
ence W. Ashford. an attorney of this
city, late of Honolulu.' have been
I charged, through a suit filed in the of
' flee of the County Clerk yesterday after*
! noon, with having conspired to black^
mail and extort from J. F. Turner of this
: city the, vast sum of $250,000. J. F.
Turner appears as plaintiff in the ac
tion, the object of which is to bring the
j defendants into court and make them, if
\ they ran, establish any claim they may
I have upon the plaintiff, and if they have
J none to forever hold their peace. The
I sum named is sufficient for the needs of
! the case, but Turner says that a half mil
j lion dollars would not cover the prop
erty's value they sought to wrest from
him through methods that bespeak their
i own merits.
In th<* complaint Turner avers that on
March -i of the present year Lucas- and
Aflhford combined, conspired and con
â  federated together to blackmail him, as
above stated, and in furtherance of the
conspiracy falsely represented to Morltz
A. Rose, who is joined in the action as
I a defendant, . that Turner was indebted
to him and to thi.-m in the sum of $250,
--000, and by means of fabricated evidence
ami misrepresentations induced Rose to
believe that the indebtedness now exists.
All of the defendants, It is- further set
forth, claim that Turner is Indebted to
them in the sum named upon an obliga
tion arising on contract, and' threaten,
and have by means of letters addressed
I to Turner threatened, that if Turner does
I not pay them the money they will accuse
him of crime, cause his arrest and prose
cute him untU such time as the demanus
! are satisfied.
In defense it is set forth in the com
plaint that Turner is not indebted to the
â defendants or either of them and that no
obligation exists upon which a claim
arises or- could arise. For these reasons
the plaintiff holds that the claim- Is false,
fictitious and wholly unfounded and the
i direct product and result of the con
spiracy to blackmail Turner as alleged.
Hence the court is prayed to compel the
defendants to plead their claims, and that
the court decree that the claims are ab
solutely without right and are fraudulent,
null and void.
I Behind this suit there rests an interest
obliterated, leaving only blankness or
despair.
It did not take Expert Thomson of
the visiting committee long to pass
judgment on the ramshackle buildings,
which for upward of thirty years
have served the city as a refuge for
its residents suffering with contagious
diseasrs. "They could not be re
paired," was his dictum. The shingles
have been bJnwn from the roof In.
places and there is nothir.gto which
new shingles could be affixed. The
buildings themselves would topple over
with decay wore it not that they have
been braced from time to time to re
sist the pressure of the winds. They
are innocent of paint, none of which
preservative has apparently been ap
plied in years.
Expert ThoÂ»nson outlined at once a
rough plan for suitable buildings.
These would be rectangular in shape,
each of the three sections to be built
as funds permitted. The worst of the
present builuings would be replaced at
ing story of the concoction of the alleged
blackmailing conspiracy, as told by Tur
ner.
"About fourteen months ago Clarence
W. Ashford, the circumstances of whose
departure from Honolulu and arrival in
this city caused no little comment, was
presented to trie as the legal representa
tive of M. A. ROBe, a man with who.ni I
had done considerable business. Subse
quently Mr. Rose recommended that I call
upon the lawyer regarding a loan then un
der negotiation. Ashford, at a later date,
called upon me and offered to loan me
$2(hio and take as security a mortgage for
$2250 I held upon a piece "of Oakland prop
erty. At that time he told me that Rose
was very anxious that he (Ashford) be
come the assignee of the 'Nobby' Clarke
estate. He knew that I had place 1 In
the hands of Rose a block of the notes I
held against the estate in question and he
told me that if he could make a proper
showing he could secure the appointment.
If he secured the appointment, he said,
he could raise some money, which he
would use in straightening up titles and
â would give me any that I might need at
the time. All he needed was standing,
and he would have it if I would transfer
a block of the Clarke paper to him in
trust and sufficient mortgages to back
him up. With this backing in hand he
could get Mr. Thurston. who was as
signee, to resign, and he could secure the
appointment.
Through his smooth talk and by re
commending his own nonesty I placed in
his hands in trust $176.KJ0 of the Clarke
notes of face value, without interest, and
also mortgages to the value of about of
$11,000, and also for collection some notes
and insurance policies amounting to
about $5000. In a short time after this
matter was fixed up Ashford wanted some
money, and I paid him back â  $324. When
Ashford drew up the trust papers he
made them all to suit himself, and I
thinking it was all right signed them.
Then in a very short time I discovered
that Ashford was trying to make ar
rangements that did hot suit me. and to
my great surprise one day I got a note
that I was wanted in court to make a
statement to Mr. Ashford concerning the
Clarke estate. I at once began to se^
that I had another man on my hands to
fight, and the fight commenced. After
several months of continual annoyance
and a large amount of expense I suc
ceeded in knocking Mr. Ashford out In
court. A few days ago I received a let
ter telling me that Ashford, M. A. Rose
and A. E. Lucas had joined hands and un
less I came to the front at once with
money I would be arrested and sent to
prison, as they had conspired together to
send me to the penitenitary.
"It appeared to me then that Ashford
was going to try and blackmail me out
of all the property I put in his hand?,
but the greatest surprise of it all to me
was to learn that Lucas has joined in to
lend his assistance and obtain more
money.
"It turns out now, however; that Lucas
has a good reason to join Ashford in his
blackmail, for some time ago Rose em- |
ployed Lucas to settle up the business !
that stood between Rose and myself. Aa
soon as Rose put his business in the i
hands of Lucas, he (Rose) at once be- '
came hostile to me ami in a short time
refused to speak to me when we met. Lv- [
cas began to crowd- me for money and I
began * v pay him, so as to get rid of the
amount I believed Rose was entitled to.
Lucas soon arranged it so that I could
not talk to Rose, and the most of thrÂ»
time he (Lucas) would warn me against :
meeting Rose. He also warned me against '
saying anything to Rose about the mone> i
paid, for he said Rose was armed, and |
just as sure as I got into a dispute or
even- a talk with Rose there would be a
shooting scrape. He said he could handle '
Rose if I would say nothing, but pay as
fast as I could toward settling my indebt- i
edness to Rose., and by so doing all would !
come out right.
"He (Lucas) represented to me that he
would act and work for my interest It' I
would pay him for his -services -as well.
He successfully kept Rose 'at swords'
points with me, but I was Ignorant that
s-uch was the case, and now I find out
that out of $6000. that I have pai* Lucas
on my account with Rose lie h;is never
paid Rose one dollar, but kept it all.
"His idea was that I would ret beaten
in the suits I had with the Italian bar
ber, Frenna, and go to jail-, and then my
word would not be taken and he would
get away with the entire $6000. So his last
resort was to Join Aehford and have me
arrested. Then he wouia swear that he
had received no money and Rose would
believe him and In this way he would
once at an expense estimated at $1000.
This not to include plumbing, which
would be of the plainest character.
The committee will recommend that
this work be undertaken at once. The
building run be made ready for oc
cupancy within three weeks. Th.- two
remaining portions of tfte building
could b<- added at any time. The in
tention of the Sup' rvisors is to relieve
the most pressing demands on them at
once.
The committee visited tho City and
County Hospital >>n thtjr r. tiirn. They
were shown through the lijk insiitution
by Dr. C. E. Bussdorff, superintendent
physician. Its heedi \. re explained,

of Health.
! still get clear of one of the vilest black
mailing schetnes ever put up. To show
; that this was his plan, he and Ashford
had taken Rose in with .them and of
| course,: as .long as Rose had received no
money that was paid by ijie, he was will
ing .to join' them and do: anything they
wanted him to do in order to punish me
; not knowing that I had paid over for him
I more than |6000. . .
"Then, again, neither Ashford nor Lv
; cas have any money and the plan was to
: get Rose to join them against mo and
; have Rose put up the money required un
til they could get me in jail and retain
all the money and property in their hands.
Another strong point they had in mind
! was that they could swear my life away
( I do not place any blame on Rose. He
; is simply the innocent victim, and they
: were going to use him for all it was
worth. I am now forced into another mat
ter in order to protect myself, and now I
; am going to shQW the whole blackmailing
scheme up and before I am through I
think some one will land in jail "

one of startling incidents and dramatic
interest. .
THEY ARE MARRIED AGAIN.
Cora Bell Parish Weds William T.
Plunkett in San Jose.
After a half year of separation William
T. Plunkett, football player and school
teacher, has again taken Cora Bell Par
ish into his home as his wife. Yesterday
afternoon Plunkett led his divorced wife
to the altar, or rather to the bar before
City Justice Gass in San Jose, and the
marital knot that was severed by Judge
Hebbard in this city October }9 last waj
tied again. The second marriage of this
young couple will doubtless cause sur
prise among those who know them, espe
cially among those who remember the
many eccentricities of the husband which
were brought to light during the trial of
the divorce proceedings before Judge i
Hebbard.
It was not long after the first marriage
that Mrs. Plunkett brought suit against
her husband for divorce. The case was
about ready for trial when â  Mrs
Plunkett's counsel came into court and
asked that the proceedings be "dismissed
as a reconciliation had been effected be
tween the young couple. The reconcilia
tion was of short duration, however, and
at the end- of a few weeks a second suit
was tiled by Mrs. Plunkett. -This time
the matter was carried through the court
and the young woman was granteil a de
cree on the ground of her husband's cru
elty. But it seems that again a reconcil
iation has been effected, but just how does
not appear.-

THE CITY'S SEAL
MAY EMBELLISH
HERO MEDALS
The Supervisors to
Sanction Its Use.
At the meeting of the Board of .Super
visors to-morrow L. F. Byington, one of:
its members, will introduce a resolution
in behalf of the joint committee of the
Native Sons and Daughters which will
have for its purpose the sanctioning of
the use of the municipal seal v>f the city
on medals to be struck off arid presented
to the California heroes on their return
from Manila.
This course has been deemed necessary
by the sub-committee, composed of Su
pervisor Byington, Judge Frank Murasky
and ex-Assemblyman Mulcreavy, on ac
count of the fact that Governor Gage has
seen fit to p&cket the bill that gave the
State's sanction to embellish the medals
with the great seal of California.
The executive's action was criticized by
members of the joint committee last
night because of the fact that Governor
Gage did not give any reason for not
signing the bill that passed both houses
of the Legislature.
It is confidently believed that the mem
bers of the municipal board will show
more patriotism than the chief executive
of the State by unanimously adopting the
resolution which has such a. worthy ob
ject in view. The committee is . lso con
lident that in the event the resolution
passes the board Mayor Pholan, who is a
leading member of tne Native Sons, will
not delay in affixing his signature to it.
On the 10th of May it is the purpose of
the organization to give a grand enter
tainment in Mechanics' Pavilion for the
purpose of raising money to carry out its
plans. On that occasion the best talenc
in the city will participate. A fancy drill
and a military concert, to be followed by
a dance, are to bo features. The Payilion
bas already .been engaged for the even
ing, and preparations for the event are
being pushed forward at this early day
by the entertainment committee, "which
consists of the following well-known Na
tive Sons and Daughters:
P. F. Mertens. H. K. Faure. T. C. Comvav
W. C. Miller, T. li. Hamilton, Joseph if.

THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APEIL 8, 1899.
one of the quickest transactions of its
kind on record. It was literally a
case of "Good-morning, Mr. Hawley.
. We were burned out last night. How
much will you ' take for your busi
ness?" "Good^morning, Mr. Sloss. I
am sorry for your misfortune. We
want such-and-such a price for our
plant," and the lightning deal was.
made.
. A messenger was at once dispatched
to c a sign painter's and in less than
an hour he returned with a newly
" .pajnted canvas sign. It was hung on
"the front," of t.hs btiilding over the
fiff:n "Hawley .Brothel's*." and people
ssing up and down Market street
were" , amazred - : when they read
. "Miller, Sloss " : & Scott, successors to
â¢ Haw^y I â .â Â£! '.-."' " Â

atlves of Miller, Sloss & Scott knew
it. They held a conference with the
rival firm, and, In less time than it (
takes to tell were in a position to car- '
ry on their business just, the-same as â â¢â '.
i;' they had never been burned out. i
And so it is that the pioneer hard
y.are firm Of the Pacific Coast has <
passed into history, and Miller, Sloss .
& Scott are entitled to the credit of
consummating the quickest big busl
ness deal on record. '
During the afternoon Mr. Sloss and
his partners busied themselves about (
their now store getting matters in
shape and familiarizing themselves (
with the situations in their new
store. A number of rks were put ,
to work taking stock, an operation !
that- will take, several weeks. '.
The contents, ';\;iir<s nnd building
of Miller, Sloss & Scott were insured ',
for .the sum of $254,000. Of this
amount $32,500 was carried on the (

DID NOT SELL OUT TO
THE BEET SUGAR TRUST
BOBERT F. OXNAED DENIES
I;:! TELEGRAPHIC STATEMENTS.
'Says the Four Factories at Cnino,
Hueneme, Grand Island and Nor
folk Were Only Consoli
dated.
: . Herbert ;F- Qxnard, secretary of the
â Western Sugar Refinery, when seen last
evening m regard to the telegraphic dis
patches that the beet sugar factories of
Which his brother, Henry Oxnard, is pres
ident, had been sold out to the beet sugar
trust, ; made an emphatic denial of the
truth of the s tat em en t .
'.'The faetk- in the case." said he, "are
these;' About a month ago four factories,
situated at Chlno, Hueneme, Grand Island
and Norfolk, the last two in Nebraska,
.â Were consolidated into one organization.
There was no saLe of the properties, but
the capital stock was placed at $5.00Q,(V>0
preferred and $15,000,000 common, of wh: h
riot all was issued. The only f.
â¢about the deal is that two large banking
.firms of New York have just been I
into the concern. They are Kuhn, 1. b
&. Go. and Spencer, Trask & Co. The
name of the nevf corporation is the Am. --
..lean Beet Sugar Company and not the
Beet Sugar Trust. The idea of a trust is
'. from the fact that there are twen
;tj--four fceet sugar factories in the !
States arid twenty more are in project,
eight of which will be started in M'ichi
pn,'!, where the bounty laws relating to
Beet sugar are very generous.
"The object of the consolidation is tr>
have the factories under one central or
ganization in order to obtain better re
suits. The statement that the price paid
for the properties was $3,000,000 is errone
ous, as no moneys passed in the trans
action whatever. The same interests con
trolled the factories separately as they
do now collectively. Heni*y Oxnard was
the president of the four factories and Is
how president of the combined plants."

Appraisements.
City and County Attorney Lane called
on Customs Collector Jackson recently
for the purpose of conferring with him
with reference to a resolution recently
passed by the Board of Supervisors di-
recting Attorney Lane to examine the
authorities and give his opinion as to
the power of the Supervisors to compel
the Collector to allow them an inspection
of the roll of merchandise appraisements
in the Custom House.
The purpose of the Supervisors seems
to have bot-n to assist the Assessor of San
Francisco in â murtmritig t)i.-> stock of goods
of the big Wholesale firms in the United

Jackson had refused to give thorn the
information desired, his grounds being
that the municipality of San Francisco
had no jurisdiction over the books of
the Custom-house. Then Attorney Lane
was called upon to examine the law and

SOUGHT TO KILL
THE WOMAN WHO
HAD JILTED HIM
Mad Act of a Real
Estate Agent.
DISARMED AFTER A STRUGGLE
H. M. BENSON CREATES A SCENE
IN A LODGING HOUSE.
He Attempted to Shoot a Woman
for Whom He Left His Wife
and Three Young Chil
dren.
H. M. Benson, a real estate agent, Is
locked up In the City Prison with a charge
of disturbing the peace recorded against
him.
Jealous of the woman whom he claimed
as his wife, Benson last evening placed a
loaded revolver In his pocket and started
out with the avowed determination of
killing her. Learning that she was stop
ping In a lodging-house at 118 Sixth street,
Benson Invaded her apartments, but was
prevented from making her a subject for
the Coroner by the night clerk, who had
followed him to the room and disarmed
him just as he was in the act of shooting
his helpless victim. A policeman was at
once summoned and he placed the mur
derous real estate agent under arrest.
The woman whose life Benson sought is
named Ellen Maloney. According to her
story he was married to her sister, by
whom he had three children. The faith
less Ellen subsequently appeared on the
scone and he fell matlly in love with her.
His wife, learning that he was infatuated
with her sister severely upbraided him.
The following day Benson bade his wife
and children adieu and took up his abode
with the sister in the lodging-house on
Sixth street.
A short time afterward, suspecting that I
the woman was untrue to him, the love-
Bmltten real estate agent attempted to
end his miserable existence by swallowing
a quantity of morphine. He was found in
a semi-conscious condition and removed j
to the Receiving Hospital, where he soon :
i recovered. Since then, he claims, he has
received corroborative evidence of the '
unfaithfulness of Ellen and he determinr d
to kill her and then blow out his brains.
"She has wrecked my life," declared
Benson, after he had been taken to the

vented me from killing her. She came to

the revolver from a friend, and after ex- !
amining it to make sure that it 1 was all '

which she was seated the clerk, who evi

I eluded Benson, as he was being led into a

against Benson to-morrow.

The Prompt â¢ Way .to Cure Yourself .When Symptoms Show ,
That Your Blood Is Out of Order. ... - ; >'.'-
THE EMINENT SPECIALIST'S FREE OFFER TO ALL
READERS OF "THE CALL" \> : / %,
For a great many years it has been j
the custom for sick people .to say: "My
blood is out of oFder. It needs purify-
ing. I feel all used up. My skin needs
blearing. My brain feels tired."
They are right, but do they act right?
They generally go and get a laxa-
tive (bowel-cleaner) to purify the blood.
Does their blood run through their
bowels?
Science has to-day furnished proofs
that all the purifying that your blood
needs, in faci, all that can be done,
must be done by your kidneys.
All the blood in your body passes
through your kidneys once every three
minutes.
The kidneys strain or filter out the
impurities in the blood â that is . their
work.
Purifying your blood is not a question
of taking a laxative or physic.
Does your, blood run through your
bowels?
What the bowel-cleaner does is to
throw out the poisons confined in your |
bowels ready for absorption into your j
blood, but the poisons which are al-
ready in your blood, causing your pres-
ent sickness, it leaves there.
There is no other way of purifying
your blood except by means of your
kidneys.
That is why bowel-cleaners fail to
do their workâ they fail to help the kid- j
neys.
When you are sick, then, no matter |
what you think the name of your dis- !
ease is, the first thing you should do \
is to afford aid to your kidneys by us-
ing Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the
great Kidney Remedy.
In taking Swamp-Root you afford
natural help to nature, for Swamp-
Root is the most perfect healer and ;

ThÂ£ little rivalry between Police Lieu- !

Will either hide away their fan-tan games

beaten. Price last night made a splendid j
haul at "San Jose Charlie's" -club, 122 :
Waverly place. ; . i
Price, who has studied the habits of tho j
Chinese for years, laid his plans care- j
fully, and as a result secured as many j
men In one raid as Esola did in the two,
besides securing evidence. Instead of j
rushing in a squad armed with axes up
against the doors and thus warning the j
players. Price caught them napping. He j
detailed Officer Butler to watch the place
carefully, arid when a favorable opportu
nity presented itself to give a signal.
Butler carried out his instructions to the
letter. He secreted himself in the hall
way, and after a short' watch had the
gentle aid to the kidneys that is known
to medical science.
Dr. Kilmer, the eminent physician
and specialist, has attained a far-
famed reputation through the discov-
ery and marvelous success of Swamp-
Root in purifying the blood, and there-
by curing chronic and dangerous dis-
eases, caused by sick kidneys, of which
some of the symptoms are given below.
Pain or dull ache in the back or head,
rheumatism, neuralgia, nervousness,
dizziness,, irregular heart, sleepless-
ness, sallow complexion, pimples,
blotches, skin troubles, dropsy, irrita-
bility, loss of ambition, obliged to pass
water often during the day and to get
up many times at night, and all forma
of kidney, bladder and uric acid trou-
bles.
Swamp-Root is sold by all dealers, in
fifty-cent or one-dollar bottles. Make
a note of the name, SWAMP-ROOT.

He at once gave the signal and rushed
into the room.
There was a mixed crowd in the center
of the room playing fan-tan. As soon -as
the officers made their appearance the
players commenced grabbing for tha
money and beans, but they were too late.
The. "complete layout, including $35 in
cash, the beans and hooks were taken as
evidence. Twenty-one Chinese, fix Jap
anese, three Filipinos and one Ladrona
Islander were placed under arrest. The
raid Is probably the most successful one
thai has ever been made, as the men were
actually caught playing the game and the
evidence was snatched out of their hands.

A week ago the home team was- shut

I was due to lack of practice, and yester
day's game proved It, for during the week
the men have been trimming their lamps,
and now they can all see the ball. Uncle
Hank â¢ has no â  reason to begin searching
for strengthening material.
Frisco opened the proceedings;, and al
though two hits and a pass came to them
they failed to score. But Sacramento got
a tally Without a hit. : Meaney worked a
pass and was safe at second on Hartman's
high throw down to head him off. While

was given his base and -Hartman made
another bum throw to second to catch
him. allowing "Meaney to score.

THE SAN FRAISCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 2, 1899.
THE STRANGE
REY DEL TIERRA
WON THE STAKE
Palace Hotel Handi
cap a Surprise.
CROMWELL FINISHED SECOND
NAPAMAX RAN THIHD, WITH
DAVID TFJSTNY UNPLACED.
What-Ei* Lou Made a Game but Fruit
less Effortâ Satsuma, the Other
Top-Weight, Also An
chored.
In many respects the Palace Hotel
handicap, decided at Oakland track yes
terday, -was a recapitulation of the Burns
handicap, only attended by entirely dif
ferent results and under dissimilar condi
tions. The richer handicap was decided
over a heavy track, and the battle at the
end was between the heavy-weights. Yes
terday, with the exception of Fleur de
l.is. nearly the same bunch of horses
faced the issue,' only over a good but not
an extremely fast track. The Fame swell
crowd was there to wager on the result,
but when the time came for the eager
riders to ask the question from the n.^ble
brutes they straddled the top-weights
were back in the dust. The prixe was cap
tur.d by Bey del Tierra. ridden by Bull
man whose last ihre.> races had evidently
been run for the benefit of the handicap
por-i-and Mr. Brooks fell. Not only did
Rev del Tierra win but his Btable com
panion, CromwoJl, ran second, beaten but
Â«i head. The mile and a furlong was rat
tled off in 1:54 flat. The Burns & Water
house pair. Napamax and David Tenny,
had flrst oall in the betting, while 12 to 1
was laid against the winning stable. 10
a good start the i arly pace was Bhaped up
by La Goleta, closely attended by What-
Er Lou. When the stretch was reached
the latter horse led the way, even then be
ing urged on. Nearing the wire Key del
Tierra took command and led his mate
over the line a head. Following came
the game Xapamax. which made a bril
liant spurt the last part.
It was a most disastrous day for short
priced horses, Dr. Sheppard, at odds on,
being the only winning choice.
The opening six furlong sprint looked
only a ramble for Dr. Sheppard, and the
ring took no liberties with him. Away
lirst, the doctor won all the way, beating
Socialist out a couple of lengths.
The mile soiling run went to Benamela,
against which the invigorating price of
10 to 1 was laid. Jones had the mount,
and the brown gelding led the favorite,
Stftmina, over the line a length. Johnny
Keiff, astride the latter, waited until the
sun went down before he made a move.
Harry ThobUTn cashed in early, and Tony
Lticalzl secured the. small end of the purse.
"With a catapult start. Ella Boland fell
heir to tha two-year-old scramble. She
was 5 to 1 In the betting, and was backed
by the Qulnn confederacy. Bathos was
second.

Track Notes.
The stable of horses owned by Book
maker Caesar Young will- leave for St.
Louis to-day. Caesar had in his barn a
very highly tried youngster that he con
sidered too good to spring here, but which
will be tried later on.
After the showing made by Highland
Ball in the opening aprint the judges add
ed the chestnut horse's name to the pro
scribed list. His entry will not be ac
cepted in future at Oakland.
After' finishing out the stake race Morl
nel ran away with Johnny Reiff and final
ly pulled up in very bad condition. She
will not race again for a long time.
Andrisa, the crack filly of Walter Jen
nings' string, was slightly cut down in
the two-year-old scramble.
Charles P. Price, presiding steward of
the California Jockey Club, will leave for
his home. In Memphis, Term., to-day. Mr.
Price is an affable, painstaking- official
and made a host â¢of friends during his
sojourn in California.
It was a great day for horses bred on
the Bitter Root Stock Farm of Marcus
Daly, in the light air region of Montana.
In the two-year-old dash Ella Boland
showed a clean pair of heels to a select
crowd, among them Andrisa and Flower
of Gold, two of Rancho del Paso'a best.
Bathos, which ran second, is alsV> a prod
uct of Bitter Root. In the final run of
the day Balista, a superbly bred one from
the Daly establishment, defeated a bunch
of tho fastest sprinters on the track.
Fred Foster, the Eastern turfman,
owner of Abuse and other horses, who
finds himself mixed up in a bad entan
glement with Argyl Howard, or "Plung
er" Hill, as he is better known, was ar
raigned in the Recorder's court at Oak
land yesterday on a charge of embezzle
ment. His hearing was set for Monday
morning at 10 o'clock. Foster and How
ard are owners of the horses Yellow Tail
and Sam McKeever, and on Friday, it is
Bald, Foster attempted to ship the
horses East without letting his partner
know of the fact. Foster was released
on JK'iOO bail.
The racing for the next two weeks at'
Oakland will be given under tho auspices
of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club.
Sunday's Handball Games.
The entries for Sunday's handball g-ames
at Phil Ryan's court at SSS Howard street
promise to give the spectators a day of
good sport.
The match between Nealon and Hamp
ton vs. Bonnet and T>inehan will certainly
be well worth wau-hinj?, as this quartet
have been contending for months as to
which should be considered the better
players. Nealon, who was in bad condi
tion last Sunday, has pulled hlmseif
together for this occasion and will un
doubtedly prive a pood measure of his

GREEN AND
SMITH ARE IN
FINE FETTLE
All Ready for Friday
Night's Contest.
THE LOCAL BOXER CONFIDENT
NATIONAL CLUB EXPECTS TO
HANDLE A LARGE CROWD,
Alec Greggains Visits Smith's Train
ing Quarters and Boxes Him.
Five Fast Bounds With
Satisfactory Results.
Local sportdom is excited over the com
ing twenty-round fight between "Myste
rious" Billy Smith and George Green,
which is to take place next Friday night
at Woodward's Pavilion under the aus
pices of the National Club. Both men are
in excellent shape for the battle. They
have had ample tinir> to train and should
go into the ring with clear "pipes" and
linn muscles.
When the match was made Green was
already in fine trim. In expectation of
his battle with "Kid" McCoy he. had been
doing a little road work every morning
and indoor work at the Olympic Club in
the afternoon. As Smith signed almost
immediately after his bout with "Kid"
Lavigne, he was ready to step into the
arena at a moment's notice.
During tlie past three w< "ks Smith has
been training faithfully at CroU's Gar
dens, Alamwia. In the morning before
breakfast the "Mysterious" and his train
er, Hennessy, take a ten-mile spin along
the Sun Leandro road. The wet weajher
did not hamper Smith's road work. He
likes the mud and went out every morn
ing as usual. Alter dinner Smith usually
boxes? several rounds with his trainer or
anybody else who is fond of sparring and
taking a punch or two that hurts. He
ft-els confident of winning and will go
into the ring weighing in the neighbor
hood of 14. r > pounds.
George Green has boon doing, his pre
paratory work at the Olympic Club, where
the local boxer feels perfectly .at home.
Green seems to be stronger and cleverer
than when he fought here last. He is
heavier by several pounds. A few days
ago he was critically examined by Dr.
Gallwey, who pronounced him the most
perfect specimen of manhood that he had
ever seen stripped.
When Green fought Smith in New York
lnst summer the heat was a potent fac
tor in his defeat. At least Green feels
that the oppressive sultry weather sapped
the "snap and ginger" out of him, and
after twenty-five hard rounds Smith was
awarded the battle. When the. men met
at Carson the weather conditions there
wore quite suitable to Green and ho sue-
C â  ded in knocking Smith out in eleven
rounds. Smith's light with Kid Lavlgne
was a revelation to local ring-goers, and
many of tlum who would back George
Green against anybody in his class in the
world are a bit chary in the coming con
test
No betting has been done yet, but the
indications are that Smith will ue the fa
vorlte.
Alec Grepgains, the clever middle
welght boxer, went over to- Smith's
training quarters yesterday. Alec
stripped and boxed the Mysterious five
fast rounds. Both showed a disposition
to mi-x things, and a rattling good bout
resulted. GnerErains rates Smith the fast
est welter-weight in the business.
Both' men have agreed to weigh in at
154 pounds at 3 o'clock on the afternoon
of the battle. As Smith will not weigh
more than 14S pounds. Green will prob
ably have five pounds the best of the
weight argument;
The National Club is making prepara
tions to handle an exceptionally large
crowd. .
HIGH CLASS COUKSING.
Union Park Gives Entertainment to
a Large Crowd of Visitors.
One- of the largest cfbwds eVer present
at Union Park on a Saturday saw some
â¢high-class coursing- yesterday. The hares
ran strongly and in many in.s'tnn<-> ex
tra dogs' were, let loose to save the con
tending hounds. â¢ The- dogs ran true to
form, and tho talent had the- better of the
day's sport. Panario sprang- a new one in

TO SAIL AROUND
THE WORLD IN
A SMALL BOAT
Captain Freitsch , Will
Attempt It. r
IN A TWENTY -FOUR FOOTER
WILL GO HENCE VIA HONOLULU
; :â¢; AND MANILA. ' mfM
Prom There by Way of the Cape of
: Good Hope to New York â Sur
vey of Mission "Rock " ' '. "
Made.
r.The oddest : craft for- -an ocean voyage
ever seen 'in 'these waters is now nearing
completion at South: San Francisco. She
will be 24 feet on the Water line, flat-bot
tomed, fitted with heavy center
and sicop-rigged. '.-It. is: the intention ; of
her owner and builder .tb circumnavigate
â the globe in her, and he succeeds. he
will easily beat the' record .of Captain
Slocum in the' sloop- -Spray. , â¢â¢â '.'
. glocum sailed- from Boston and 'went
around Cape : Horn. When lie started his
boat was slodp-rigg-ed, .but .during a storm
the sails were blown out of. theboU ropes
and he had to recanvas his '.vessel in the
best manner possible. â¢ Under her new "rig
the Spray reached Apia., Samoa." andthere
Captain Slocum took a. rest. The Spray
was sixty-two, days from juan Fernandez-
In the Atlantic to â¢ Samoa in the Pacific.
and it pro.ved:'a -long irnd' tedious journey
for the lonely -o.ccupo.nt of ihesmall boat.
From Samoa the Spray went to Austra
lia and ;. â¢ w Zealand, and then back to
Boston. by way. of Japan and' China and
the Suez canal.- The, only mishap was rhe
loss of the sails and the death !of his. "dog,
Captain Slocum's only companion.' ..'>
Captain A<3olph Freitkch is the venture
some man who is going to make the,.VQy
age in the 24-footer." He hails fromM'il
waukee,; and is backed in his venture "by
A. K. Brtmer of La Salle street, Chicago.
In 1594 he sailed across the Atlantic, in a
40-foot schooler, called the Nina,, He
made the trip alone-, and- It. took the Nina
thirty-four akys and- thfee hours to cover'
the â 'isinnce from Sandy' Hoofc' to the
English coast. , . Later Captain Freitsch
made two trips acros* Lake Michigan in -a
Fkiff rigged with a sail. He made the last
return voyage during the \ stormy fall
weather and was pearly lost. In fact,, he
was bo long making the trip that hia
friends despaired of ever seeing him
again. Alater attempt to sail down the
Mississippi in a' email boat built by him
bclf was abandoned, and since then the
TO CIRCUMNAVIGATE THE GLOBE.
â  a TWENTY-FOUR foot boat is now being completed at South San Francisco in which Captain Adolph g
.* A will endeavor to sail around the world. From here he will go to Honolulu, thence to Manila, Â£
V **and then back to the United States by way of the Cape of Good Hope. Captain Slocuni made his way 5
\ around the world in the sloop Spray a few years ago, but his venture was easy compared with the one &
.â¢ Captain Freitsch is about to undertake. " Â»S
1 captain has been seeking for fresh ven
i tures In which to risk his life.
On this occasion, according to the agree
ment. Captain French is to make the
[journey from San Francisco to Honolulu
in 21 days in a M-foot boat. From H >no
lulu he is to make the journey to Manila
in 42 days. If all goes well and the voyage
to the Philippines is a success the jour
ney will be continued around the Cape of
Hope into the Atlantic and thence
to X.ew \ork circumnavigating the' globe,
a feat never before attempted under such
condii
' The 2>-foriter is to be caHed the Coke
and. will bo something like Commodore
Baettge'e sloop Ma Belle. In this little
craft the commodore has weathered two
.of the heaviest gales that ever blew on
the coast of California. On â  earh occa
sion lie was either on his way to or re
turning from the Farallones. The first
time the wind blew over 100 miles an hour
and no one ever expected to pp,> t} 1( . m :1
Belle or her venturesome owner again.
But she turned up all right and Batttge
: suffered only from the loss of sleep.. The
.VI., Belle was out again in thÂ« last storm
and finally had to run into Santa Cruz in
distress. The adventure-* of the enninio
dore and his companions on that occasion
are still fresh in the. minds of the public.
Froitsch's iVikf- will be different from
tii. Ma Belle in that she will be flat-bot
tomed and will, carry a eenterboard. She
will be ri_rcM differently and her sails
will be easy for one man to handle. At
this time of the year fast trips to Hono
lulu are not the rule-, so Captain Freitsch
will have to hustle to get the Coke to Ha
waii in twenty-one days.
The Sacramento River steamer Modofi
played havoc with Broadway wharf yes
; terday. While trying to make a landing.
i the flood tide carried her dowji and she
crashed into the north end of the pier.. A
number of piles were carried away,
stringers were smashed and the flooring
of the wharf forced off by the collision.
The Modoc was damaged on her star
board quarter, but not to any great ex
tent.
L'ncle-Sam made his first move in the'
1 direction of securing Mission Rock for a
i oaling station yesterday. Surveyor Gen
eral Gleave-s and two assistants. Assist-'
,'int United States District Attorney
Woodworth and George Wright of- the
California Drydock Company went- out to
the- rock on th 6 tug Liberty yesterday
afternon and a careful survey of the place
was made. The United States will claim
all of the rock that wns above tide water
tie time the drydoek company took
possession and made all thÂ° improvements
that exist to-day. The area that has
â  been added to the rock by these improve
ments will be carefully noted and then an
offer will be made or some- understanding
reached by which the United States will
take peaceable possession.
The new patrol wagon for the Harbor
police was in use yesterday. It certainly
has not put in an appearance before "It
was wanted. It will prevent the disgust
ing spectacle of drunken sailors being

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 2, 1899.
APRIL CALLED
OUT ALL ITS
ARMY OF FOOLS
The Jester and Victim
Alike Make Merry.
THE MORGUE'S BUSY DAY
McENERNEY AND HIS COUN
TERFEIT PRESENTMENT.
Sad Tale of the Dentist Apprentice
and the Soubrette Who Could
Not Find the Key to the
Curtain.
April dawned bright and beaming and
kept merry throughout its. first day
blithely warbling between laughs, "Al!
fools look alike to me."
In spite of the fin de siecle pessimist
and his prophecy that All Fool's day was
a landmark of the past, the jester was
out In splendid form and landed gudgeons
galore.
The fun began early and lasted late.
A very few new jokes were perpetrated
and all the old ones revived, while the
usual good humor of both jester and vic
tim prevailed during the entire day. The
email boy was not so much in evidence
;is in previous years. Thoughts of Easter
eggs on the morrow, coupled with the ar
duous duties of trying on new suits and
boots and hats, drove for once all
thoughts of mischief from the mind of
the budding lords of creation. The offi
cials at the Morgue were the first to fall
victims to the merriment- of the day.
When the day was but a half hour old
âat 12:30 a. m.â a telephone call, pre
sumably coming from the Receiving Hos
pital, summoned a Deputy Coroner to take
charge of a body at the Hobson House.
"Hurry-up wagon" and Deputy went
quickly to the place, only to find that
April had dawned and that some one un
known wa? taking liberties with dignified
city officials.
In fact, the Morgue, or. rather, the
Morgue's telephone, was the greatest fcuf
: fen-r during the day. The bell rang un-
| -ceasingly from early morning until mid
i night and all sorts of messages were
voiced- over the line. Heartless wretches
also employes this method of fooling un
suspecting friends.
Tiner-aling-iing.
"Hello! Wellâ"
"Oh. la that you. Mary? This is Jim.
Say Mr. Wilson wants to speak with you.
Call him upâ No. 1947."
â¢'Hfllo. No. 1947! Ts this Mr. Wilson?"
"No: this is the Morgue."
A bangâ that's Mary's . telephoneâ a
enweâ that is the Morgue.
While people were having fun at the
expense of the city the' city was enjoying
Its own pet little April fool jokeârepeat
ing the prank over and over a^aln and
hailing each new victim with shouts of
applause and the shrill tooting of horny.
At the junction of Market. Kearny. and
Third streets at regular intervals a box,
neatly packed and stamped, as though
rc-ady for mailing, would glare the guile
less pedestrian straight in the face. Many
a man, woman and child, representing all
sorts and conditions of society, stooped
to pick up the innocent-appearing box.
None got any farther than the attempt.
The shouts of the crowd, many of them
previous victims, scared the parcel-picker
off, and he hastily lost himself in the
throng and waited in his turn for some
one to laugh at.
It was both a costly and hair-raising
April fool experience that Walter Mosier
had. Mosier. a young man possessed with
an ambition to learn dentistry, is em
ployed by Dr. Perkins, a Sixth-street den
tist. Walter's bogs occasionally allows
him to putter around the molars of his
customers who are out of funds.
One of thes? occasions arose Friday and
Mosier was delegated to perform the
charity service. The, victim was a boy
about 12 years of age. He was suffering
from an ulcerated tooth, and Mosier de
cided that the nerve must be killed, so
forthwith he filled the cavity in the
troublesome tooth with enough arsenic
to kill a horse and sent the unfortunate
youth home happy.
When Dr. Perkins came in Mosier, with
the dignity of a full-fledged dentist, told
his employer of his charity work. Then
Dr. Perkins thought of April fool.
"Say, Mosier." said the dentist, with a
serious look on his features. "I've just
received a telephone message to the ef
fect that the arsenic came out of that
boy's tooth and he swallowed it."
"My God!" exclaimed, the would-be
dentist. lf ls he going to die?"
"Well, the doctors are working on him
now, but they don't think they can save
his life."
"Say. Doc, I'm going to get out of town
before this kid dies. I don't want to get
pinched."
"Well." said Dr. Perkins, with a merry
little twinkle in his eye. "You can suit
yourself about that, but I'd advise you to
stay here. They-can't do any more than
charge you with mupder."
"Murder! Ugh! Don't say that. Dr.
Perkins," retorted Mosier, tearfully. "I
didn't mean to do It. I'll go and take
some arsenic myself."
The crestfallen apprentice spent several
moments of contrition and then he made
up his mind to get out of town. He got
50 cents from Perkins and made haste to
the nearest barber-shop, where he Invest
ed it in a haircut and a Bhave. M osier
gave the tonsorial artist orders to cut
}-is hair to the scalp and Bhave his sprout
ing mustache entirely off, hoping thereby
m disguise himself. The badly frightened
youth then returned to the office to learn
further detnils of his mythical victim's
condition. Dr. Simpson told him thÂ« boy
was worse and Mosfer. started to leave the
office. "Wait a minute." called Perkins.
"Where are you going?'
"God knows where I'll go, but I'll never
go to jail for poisoning- that kid," an
swered the youth.
"You go down to the ferry to-morrow
and if the boy dies I'll telephone to you,"
suggested the doctor.
Mosier slipped out to his mother's
home, borrowed 510 and as early as 1
o'clock yesterday morning he arrived
at the ferry thoroughly disguised to
avoid possible detection. He walked up
and down the cheerless and 'desolate
wharves till morning, and then not hear
ing anything from Dr. Perkins bought a
ticket for Sacramento and stole aboard
the boat like a skulking criminal. On
the train he acted for all the world like
a noted forger crossing the line to Can
ada.
ttosiec confided to a friend before he
left that he would commit BUicide rather
than go to jail, which knowledge tuning
to Dr. Perkins made him decide noi to
cfrty the Josh any further. A message
was sent to the frightened youth, and
he returned to the city. Last night he
set about to drown his troubles in the
flowing bowl.
Garret McEnerney fell a victim to a
deeply laid April Fool plot laid for him
by his "close up" friend Jim O'Brien..
The bulky and brainy man of the law
dropped into O'Briens office, commonly
termed the "Cabinet," yesterday noon to
engage the contractor in a little chat.
"Say. Garret." chipped in O'Brien in
an innocent fashion just when the law
yer was i-xplaining to Jim Nealon the
way to make money, "when did you
stand for that bust over in the Palace?"
"What bust?" queried Mr. McEnerney.
"Why. the file they put in the corridor
of the Palace Hotel this morning," said
O'Brien as seriously as if he was talking
business with a moneyed man who want
ed- to spend a "thou or two" in street
work.
"There must be some mistake?" said
McEnerney. "No sculptor ever chiseled
me."
O'Brien is "close up," and his words
had weight with the man who was so
busy dissolving -the injunction against
Chief Lees that he did not stop to think
of April Fool's day.
"Let's go over, Jim, and take a look at
it," said MeEnernty, and .they both start
ed out tho door. O'Brien had no inten
tion of going over with his friend to seek
What he knew to be a myth, so he con
trived to' be excused In a manner â  that
would not breed suspicion.
The opportunity presented itself when
Judge Lawlor happened along.
"I'm going to take the Judge on -for a
minute," said O'Brien. "You go over and
look at that yourself and I'll wait for
you."
Off went Mr. McEnerney and his April
Fool went down on the arc.hives of the
"Cabnit" as a decided success. Every.
body who dropped into the Cabinet was
sent over to the Palace Hotel to see what
McEnernev had looked for in vain.
"Pete" Dtinworth. the well-known vo
calist, was- the victim of a ghastly April
Fool josh. One of his friends telephoned
to Dunworth's â¢ house early yesterday
morning and informed him that an inti
mate friend had died the night before
and was to be buried immediately.
"They, want you to be a pallbearer,
Pete," said th-e wily person at the other
end of the line.
"All right." said the popular tenor, af
ter expressing genuine regret over tae
unexpected death of his friend.
Promptly at 1 o'clock Dunworth, ar
rayed in a black cutaway suit and white
gloves, arrived at the .undertaking par
lors from which the supposed dead friend
was to have been buried.
"Is this where Mr. So and So Is to be
buried from." asked Dunworth, giving
the undertaker the friend's name and ad
dress.
"Why, he 1b not dead," said the under
taker, "who knew the man very well. "I
just ?aw him "at the corner of Sixth and
Mission."
At the Alcazar they revived the old the
atrical joke of the "key of the curtain"
with marked success. Mrs. Willie Dun
phy, the latest addition to the company,
ten minute* before curtain raising at thp
matinee, was sent on a hunt for the "key
to the curtain." "We can't open up."
said Stage Manager Bryant. "We have
lost the key to the curtain." Mrs. Dun
phy. who glitters on the bills as Miss
Howard, searched high and low for the
key and was in a condition bordering on
hVfiterics when the last bars of the or
chestra died away and the curtain was
lifted without a key.

Important Opinion by the Supervis

Captain John Bermingham, Supervising

letter from Washington yesterday under
date of March 27 which puts an end to all
doubt on a subject of considerable im
portance to the owners of sailing vessels.
The letter reads as follows:
"Captain John Birminghamâ Dear Sir:
I am in receipt of your letter of the 22d
inst. relative to your Interpretation of
department circular No. 1!* ot February
9. 1599, and in reply would say that, hav
ing myself Interpreted ilu- law just as you
do, this office, through the Secretary of
the Treasury, submitted the matter to the
Solicitor of the Treasury, who affirms
that all sail vessels above 700 tons must
be inspected whether they carry passen
gers or not. Of course all officers of the
Government must, while such derision is
unr> versed, carefully act in accordance
therewith. J. A. DUMONT,

"BLACK HUSSAR"
AT THE GRAND
Opening of the Southwell
Season of Comic Opepa
Reviewed, by Jlskton
. Stevens.
VF^ UT will it pay?" everybody
L<<. seemed to be inquiring of every-
Obody else at the opening per
tÂ±=2 f formance of the Southwell
Comic Opera Company in the Grand
Opera-house last night. And .that is
the question. The principal singers of
the organization were divulged in the
production of "The Black Hussar," and
the company proved to be a good one.
It is large,, industrious, well sfage'man-:
aged, well costumed, and, on the whole,
well voiced. It gave a disciplined and
picturesque performance of a not "over
exciting comic opera of the old Viennese
school, and the audience was noticeably
pleased. Butâ this is a point that
might as well be argued now as at any
other timeâ will the Southwell company
be â¢ able to draw big crowds, or even
moderate crowds like that of last night,
for a season of fifteen weeks at the
present scale of prices, which range
from $1 down? I think not. The
Tivoli has spoiled the people of San
Francisco in the matter of comic opera
by often giving them for half the
money productions that while not as
lavish in points of chorus and acces
sories, were quite as good as this one
of "The Black Hussar" so far as con
cerned the singing and acting of the
principal roles. The Grand Opera-house
is a big place â comfortable and cheerful
when full and dismal and unpretty
when scarred by rows of . empty red
plush. One bad house will breed a suc
cession of others, even when the show
Is good. The crowd loves to follow the
crowd. The Southwell company pros
pered for three years in Philadelphia
at a 50-cent scale of prices, and there
is no reason why, with the same scale,
it should not do the same here for fif->
teen weeks. In a season of this length
I do not think that the town will stand
for the $1. And the company is too
good and Mr. Morosco is too earnest a
manager and too enterprising a towns
man to come to grief on account of a
foolish pride in prices. It's the gross
receipts that count in the theatrical
business whether the seats are $5 or j
50 cents.
"The FSlack Hussar" is nnc of thopr>
tuneful old-time pieces that display the
ensemble rather than the individual
strength of the performers. The mu
sic is graceful and charmingly scored,
but the book is slow in action and more
or loss dull in dialogue even when re- ,
furbished by modern hands. The sing
ing and the pictures and the playing
of a snug little orchestra under an ex
cellent leader were the features of last
night's performance: and I would find
it much easier to praise the company
as a whole than to individualize. But
here goes for a try. anyway.
First of all, the tenor gentleman,
Thomas H. Persse, who has the titje
part, is the best in his line triat we
have heard in some time. He 'would be
worth his weight in jewelry to the Bos
tonians or to the Tivoli. His acting.
like that of most comic opera sky
scrapers, is not of this earth, and his
speaking voice runs toÂ° the mock-heroic
and incantation system of ancient ex
travaganza, but he is comely and clean
to look upon, and he can sing. His
voice was clear, sympathetic and trne
last night, and might, to distinguish it
from the usual run of epicene comic
opera tenori. be described as "manly."
The soprano was Miss Edith Mason,
who not only sings but acts. She has
a lithe, birdie voice, with just the '
hint of a cunning little gurgle in it, and
a plump, companionable personality.'
She is good looking and resembles, so
the press agent says. Miss Lillian Rus
sell. In the part of the funny man's
daughter Miss Mason was quite the
st<-llar luminary of the night. It
wouldn't surprise me to hear any day
that a brand of cigars had been named
| after her, too.
The principal funny man was Wil
liam Wolff. He was. fairly good in a
fairly legitimate way, and will doubts
less be better in a better part than that j
of Hackenback and one with fewer
German lines in it. These foreign in
terlardings suggested an aroma of
malt and cheese that did not tend to
promote the excitement of the piece. The
assistant comedian is a chubby, phy- j
Fically humorous gentleman by the '
name of Arthur Wooly. He contrib
uted an excellent bit of tomfoolery.
Mr. Wolff and Mr. Wooiy sing better
than comedians are expected to do. .
The principal comic lady was .Bertha
Rlcci, who has been here' before, un
less I am badly mistaken. She infused
considerable fun into a grotesque part.
Miss Ladd was the contralto, who had
little chance, and seemed to make no .
special effort to show what she could
do. The others in the cast were not
individually notable for either disaster
or success. They contributed their
share to the general evenness of the '
production. The chorus was large and
tactfully stage-mannered and sang
with commendable snap and smash â
especially the girls.
A stunning picture was made of the
close of the second act with seven live
horses, a real brass band, and what
looked like a hundred people on the
Btage. ______________

NO GRATITUDE
IN SOUTHERN
PACIFIC CODE
Charley Mautalen No
Longer Useful.
FROM BOSS TO BARKEEPER
KICKED ASIDE WHEN HE LOST
HIS POWER.
Story With a Moral That Shows
the Workings of the Railroad
Influence in California
Politics.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 1.
The railroad company is not good to its
own-. It evidently does not make a spe
cialty of dispensing gratitude. In the
language of Mrs. Browning, it evidently
regards human beings who have served
it but can serve it no longer as chattels
I to be kicked aside, "like an old hat with
| a feather stuck in it."
Time was not many years ago when
Charley MautaJenâ everybody called him
i Charleyâ could boast of his intimate ac
quaintance with Steve Gage. He was
somebody. People went to him, ran after
him and were anxious to guess from the
crumbs that fell from his lips the nature
of any feast that there might be in sight
or that might be had for the groveling.
Charley went deep into politics with such
pronounced prestige and by continual ref
erences to Stephen T. he was able to
lead a very pleasant life. In keeping with
the railroad's idea of politics, Charley
owned a saloon and for a. few years did
|. a good business. The saloon was freÂ»
quently the rendezvous of "workers";
schemes were laid there and the
glint of gold was frequently seen in the
back room, and the statement that the
bags containing it were uranded "Si. P."
no one doubted.
Seven years ago Charley Mautalen was
elected County Republican Committee
man from the Sixth Ward. This ward U
always conceded at election time to the
railroad candidate, whoever he may be.
No 'reformer" or Municipal League can
didate could ever do anything in "the
bloody Sixth." Mr. Mautalen controlled
that ward and whatever he said was law,
it being: always conceded that he was
speaking for Mr. Stephen T. Cage, et al.
For the first two years Charley did so
well that his employers promoted him.
They had him re-elected and he was hon
or. .1 by being made chairman of the Ala
meda County Central Republican Com-
This added largely to his prestige. In
fact, tn such a degree .did he prosper that
he was enabled to sell out his profitable
â¡ and exist entirely lor two or three
years on his prestige. No one
doubted that Charley was faithful. Gage
pressed the button; Charley did the
arid did it well, or he would never have
; been retained In service for five years.
Two years ago Alameda County got
rather tired- of .Mr. Gage. This was due
to an action of Mr. Mautalen's, that at
once wrecked the railroad prestige in the
Republican party and ultimately brought
about t lit* downfall of Mautalen. At a
public meeting, at which Mr. Hilborn was
to have made v great speech, Charley
Mautalen' as chairman of the tvtunty
committee called the big gathering to
order and announced as hlB choice for
chairman of the evening his sincere friend
and staunch Republican, Hon. Stephen T.
I Gage, on hearing the name of the man
under whose auspices he was to speak
Mr. Hilborn promptly got up and walked
' out of the hall. This secured Mr. Hil
born's re-election at that time, but it was
the lifting of the keystone from out of the
; Mautalen arch. From that hour Char
-I'v'h prestige began to fall.
Two years ago he failed to be elected
a commltteeman to succeed himself, but
Ftill continued to handle his following in
the interest of Mr. Gage. Although
robbed of ail his peacock-feathers Charley
still had himself, to whom were attached
quite a following of personal friends. He
: continued to swing these into line and
â¢remained faithful to the desires of Gage
until the past month.
At Sacramento Mautalen was clearly
: shown that he was "a dead duck" in the
; railroad yard. Years of service counted
: for nothing, and Charley became the
most private of citizens. He secured a
temporary job at the Legislature and ex
pected that his old employers would look
after him. In this he was grievously dis
: appointed, and he returned to Oakland
! broken in spirit and In politics.
Now Charley is tending bar at Hanni
fin's. An honest man was needed in the
1 saloon , and Charley was ouickly taken
up, for no one ever doubteo his honesty
or his fidelity to whoever employed him.
: Since Oakland was Oakland Hannlfin's
has been a feature, and it loses none of its
â  interest with Charley behind the bar to
i tell of what has been. Some queer things
had transpired in a couple of saloons Tn
the heart of the city. The cash registers
did not work or were not permitted to
work, and the nlckel-ln-the-slot machine
: proved to be very obstinate, and it was
' thought that if any one could restore a
normal condition of affairs under such pe
culiar circumstances it would be Charley
Mautalen. So the ex-boss of the railroad
was sought out, and since then the ma
chines have been working as perfectly as
did the political system of which Charley
w;is formerly so prominent a part.
Had Charley not been turned down, and
could he have delivered a vote or two to
Dan Burns, he might now be drinking in
stead of mixing cocktails.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call, (

Sergeant Peters*n was appealed to last
night to do something which he does not .
consider in the line of- his duty. There
are in Oakland about fifty keno games .
draining nickels and quarters from
youths' pockets every night. Since the ,
game has not been prohibited the gam
blers have marvelously increased. .
In a basement at Eighth street and
Broadway one of these games is in con- .
Btant operation. Last night there was a '
little disturbance. An Italian peanut man )
had been down to inveÃt some of his I i
nickels in the game. He had cried "Keno"
at the right time, but somehow or other i (
keno. did not come to him. In this par
ticular Instance keno was worth $4 65. . .
The peanut man declared it a swindle j '
and rushed up to the sidewalk, where he â 
met Sergeant Peterson, whom he inform- \.i
ed that he had been robbed. The sergeant j
at once proceeded to get on the track of i (
the robber and was led by the peanut man
to the gambler presiding over the keno
came. He then proceeded to tell the ser- | '
geant how he had called out at the right .
minute, but had not been able to get his (
money and he expected the police >ofllcer I
to at once capture the. bank and hand it j (
over to him. . . â  â  ,'J_ v k
The sergeant informed the dupe that I .
such conduct was - not part of a police I <

his money in such a proposition he -dc- I 1

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 2, 1899.
MAYOR SNOW
OUTLINES HIS
NEW POLICY
The City Officials Are
Plainly Warned.
JACKSON FOR SECRETARY
STRONG HINT OF DESIRE FOR
NEW CHARTER.
Police and Fire Departments Axe Said
to Be in Need of Lifting to a
Higher Plane to Do Ef
ficient Work.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
9uS Broadway, April 1.
The new Board of Works held its first
meeting this morning and organized by
electing City Attorney Dow president and
R. F. Jackson of East Oakland secre
tary. R. M. Clement was re-elected chair
man of the Board of Poiicc and Fire Com
missioners. It was a pretty show of mod
esty on the part of Mayor Snow to nomi
nate his two colleagues for the two chair
manships, it being usually the case for
the Mayor to preside over the Board of
Works.
The greatest interest centered around
the secretaryship, no one having been in
formed who Mr. Snow, to whom the ap
pointment was conceded, intended â  to
nominate. The Mayor referred to the
fact that the office for ten years had been
rilled by y young men, but he proposed to
nominate one of two jor three men of
experience. â  There was just .a little un
witting irony in Mr. Snow's remarks
which followed: "The friends of the fol
lowing; gentlemen have spoken In favor
of the applicants: E. P. Flint, D. C.
Hinsdale, E. H. Morgan, R. F. Jackson,
John A. Sands, Arthur Humphrey, E. 1-.
Barber, Robert Chestnut, John Laughlin;
E. S. Finch, T. G. Kennedy, I. S. Watson,
I-i. D. Inskeep and possibly a few others,
whose names I have forgotten. I desire
to nominate R. F. Jackson."
Mr. Jackson's election was made unani
mous, and with one of hisi operatic bows
Harry Thomas vacated the seat in favor
of his successor.
There was such a large attendance of
citizens and office seekers at the meet
ing that it was necessary to adjourn from
the board room into the Council chamber.
Mayor Snow made a significant spee<
in which he indirectly argued in favor or
a new and more, practical charter. He
went over the ground frequently covered
of the peculiar positions held by the
Board of Works, and eaid^
"This board is also ex-officio the Board
of Commissioners of the Police and Fire
Departments. If it is to be regretted that
the Board of Public Works Is composed
of officers of the city who have other du
ties to perform, it is more to be regretted
that any officer of the Board of Public
Works, or' any person holding any other
office whatever, has any part in the work
of the Board of Police and Fire Commis
sioners; The patronage of the board is
limited. If a member of the Fire or Po
lice Department is appointed or dis-<
charged everybody knows it and is ready
to take sides. Every action 'of the board
is apt to be misunderstood. The Fire and
Police departments should be under the
control of a special commission, who
should have no other connection what
ever with the city government. They
should be required to conduct the depart
ments under civil service rules. No man
would then be able to find, a place even
upon the list of applicants for .positions
in these departments unless he was quali
fied beyond any other applicant. As
Mayor of the city, I have it in mind to
WEALTHY PIONEER I
JOINS THE MAJORITY }
Jay V. Lawrance, After a Pro= \\
tracted Illness, Succumbs
to Bright's Disease. "
JAY V. LAWRANCE, a wealthy pioneer of both California and Oregon,
passed away in this city at 61G Sacramento street on Friday evening. 0
Death was the result of Bright's disease, which had kept him confined
for the past several months. During his early life on the Pacific Coast ( )
Mr. Lawrance was engaged in contracting, lumbering and mining, but retired |
about ten years ago from active business and invested his fortune In, real <|
estate, including valuable ranches In Kern and Napa counties and prop-
erty In San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland. His estate will approximate Â£
$600,000.
Mr. Lawrance arrived in San Francisco June 14, 1849. He came on the f
bark Sacramento around the Horn. In connection with the captain of the
vessel, Alfred Balch, and F. S. Balch, an Eastern capitalist, he imme- L
diately took contracts for the erection of forty-eight of the first structures T
of this city. He then departed for the El Dorado of the West and found a L
fortune awaiting him in the placer lands. He deposited his money in the y
notorious Adams Bank, and when it went to the wall he returned to this I
city to recover only half of what he had deposited. â¢
Taking the remnant, he went to Oregon and erected the first building Jn I
Portland. He cut lumber on Puget Sound for a time, but again found his â¢
way back to this city, in 1863, where he engaged In contracting and build-
ing. Ten years ago he turned his business over to his son, George E. Law- "
ranee. Besides his son, Mr. Lawrance leaves a daughter, Mrs. Arrinia -fc
Whltham of Berkeley, to mourn his lose. He was 75 years of age. "
The funeral will take place to-day at 10 a. m., under the auspices of the '
California Society of Pioneers, of which he was a member. â¢
CONSIDERED HONESTY
THE BEST POLICY
Jewels Valued at Two Thousand Dollars Re
covered Through an Advertisement in
The Call
B ry^HAT rare product which Pope declares to be the noblest work of the â 
â  I Almighty appears to be increasing in. San Francisco. A few days ago -+
q la man found a purse on .the street containing currency and bonds of the O
+ X value of $10,000 and promptly returned it to the owner. Now â¢comes X
Q Henry Jacobs, a humble waiter at the Tivoli, who can justly lay claim to Â©
X the poet's classification.' "Â£
Last Tuesday night, while leavln:;
the theater, he picked up a dainty
silk handkerchief, in the corner of
which a knot was tied. He carelessly
placed it in his pocket and did not
think of the incident until the fol
lowing morning, when upon exam
ination he discovered that the knot
contained seven beautiful rinfrs. He
realized their value, but. upon report-
Ing for duty he turned the perns over
to the care' of the treasurer of the
Tlvoli and felt decidedly relieved in
mind.
The jewels were the property of
Mrs. H. S. Seabury of Portland, Or.,
who had dropped them in the aisle
while leaving the playhouse. She
reported the loss to ttie police and
Detective Ed Gibson was detailed on
the case. He searched the pawn
shops of the city, but could obtain
no clew to the missing property.
Finally an advertisement was placed
in The Call, and hy this means the
gems were restored to Mrs. Seabury,
who, it is needless to say, was over
joyed at their recovery. The lady
wanted to make Jacobs a substan
tial present, but the latter declared
that he had only done his duty. He
was finally prevailed upon to accept
a email gift as an evidence of the
appreciation of Mrs. Seabury.
The rings consisted of a marquise
of great beauty, another set with three diamonds and five set with diamonds
and emeralds, the aggregate value of which was $2000.
HENRY JACOBS.
recommend that the charter be some tlmÂ«
amended to provide for the appointment
of such commission. I do not expect eveiÂ»
then that the two departments will be
altogether out of politics; but they will
at least be out of the politics of the
Mayor, the City Attorney and the City
Engineer. Too much depends upon these
officers to have their duties interfered
with by the strivings of applicants for
positions, whether these applicants be ni,
preferred or otherwise.
Mayor Snow evidently thinks there 1s
need and possibility of some heavy prun
ing in the Police: and Fire departments.
In this connection he said: "The new
board is fortunate in being constituted of
two members who have already had two
years' experience in their management.
They will know what. to do. They will
find the new member without prejudice
and ready to join them for the betterment
of these departments. I believe they can
both be lifted up to a higher plane, made
more efficient and more highly respected
in this community. The cost of the Police
Department has increased from $49,000 in
1899 to $75,000 in 18!K, and the Fire Depart
ment, that cost $56,000 in 1890, now costs.
$*2.000 for maintenance alone. The public
has a right to demand efficiency and re
spectability in these departments for this
large outlay of money."
The Mayor evidently does not Intend to
enter upon a campaign of decapitation in
the various departments. He allayed
much uneasiness among the city employes
by saying: ;
"There are no civil service rules for the
management of the departments, but 1
find part 3, section 155 and section 206 of
the charter applicable. Part 3 of section"
156, 'The board shall have power to hear
and summarily determine all complaints
of misconduct, inefficiency or violation of.
the rules or other charge against any
officer of said department and to take
such action thereon as shall be most con
ducive to the maintenance, discipline and
efficiency of- such departments.' . â 
"Section 206â 'Competent and experi
enced- employes in the several depart
ments shall not be unnecessarily re
moved.'
""With these two sections in force and
governing the action of the board,- the
Police and Fire departments of the city
ought to be made nearly perfect in two
years."
MERRY LEGAL TANGLE
OVER NTNAMARA'S LOT
OWNERS UNHEARD FROM ARE
PRESUMED DEAD.
Queer Obstacles Encountered by Will
iam Mem in Trying to Clear
Up His Title.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
008 Broailway. April 1.
A 50-foot lot on Fourth street, nea>r
Allston, Berkeley, once the property of
James McNamara, presents a legal tan
gle the unraveling of which may cost its
value.
The lot was purchased by William Mem
some years ago under color of title from !
Mrs. Mary McNamara, who had not
heard from her hushand for several years,
and she deeded It as a widow. Since the
purchase by Mem Mrs. McNamara has
also disappeared and her whereabouts
have not been known the past eight
years. Recently Mr. Mem learned that
there might be some flaw in his title and
accordingly commenced suit to remove all
doubts.
It was found that in the eyes of the law
James McNamara was presumed to have
been dead at the time his wife deeded the
property. Yet no probate proceedings
had ever been had on the estate.
Of his fact the Public Administrator,
B. O. Hawes, was immediately apprised.
He forthwith applied for letters of ad
ministration, which were granted two.
weeks ago, and this afternoon, as admin
istrator of the estate, he filed suit against
William Mem for the recovery of the
property.
In his complaint, prepared by Attorneys
Snook & Church. Administrator Hawes
alleges that Mem entered upon the lot
without right or title and asks for a de
cree restoring possession to him, together
with $100 damages for the withholding of
possession.
No public record of the death of James
and Mary McNamara has been discov
ered, but when* Hawes applied for letters
acquaintances of theirs testified on the
witness stand that they hail not seen or
heard from the McNamara's within the
past seven years; wherefore the law pre
sumes both husband and wife to be dead.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA
TRY-OUT FIELD DAY
BERKELEY, April I.â The try-out field
day of the University of California trcak
team, held upon the college campus this
afternoon, brought out an athlete whose
record in the hammer throw was nothing
short of brilliant. For three months past
the college men have kept up their train
ing on the track in preparation for. the
big intercollegiate field day with Stanford.
and the event this afternoon had in view
the selection of men who will represent
the blue, and gold on that occasion. Poor
records throughout marked the sprints.
Everything, in fact, paled before the one
event of the hammer throw.
The winner of this was A. D. Plaw.
Flaw is a freshman, just 17 years of age,
and with hardly any doubt is destined to
be something phenomenal in this his spe-
A. D. PLAW.
clal feat. Without any exertion apparent
ly, as though It were like thro-tviiig a
s-tone. he put the 16-pound hammer a ckar
150 feet. The spectators scarcely realised
that in the single throw the
world's intercollegiate record for the
16-pound hammer had been smashed,
or that the young Berkeley fresh
man, who Mood quietly watching .the
distance measured, might some day ba
one of the best known names In American
collegiate athletics.
The present world's intercollegiate rec
ord for the 16-pounl hammer throw, with
r nine-foot run, was made by McCracken
of Pennsylvania on May 2S of last year
in New York City. MeCracken's distance
was 14!) feet I inches, and at the time, it
was deemed quite extraordinary. Flaw's
distance of 150 feet puts MeCracken's in
the second place. Once this afternoon the
youngster threw 15S feet, but the throw
was ruled out, as he fouled the line hy
an inch or two. While to-day's record is
not official. Plaw's trainer, Tom Carroll,
declares that the freshman was not at his
best and that with a month's training
before the intercollegiate meet he can be
expected to break the world's record of
ficially by several feet.
Among other events of the afternoon,
Simonds proved himself the university's
coming sprinter. His time of 10 2-5 sec
folds for the 100-yard daÂ«h can easily be
lowered a fifth this season, and with" fair
training he will certainly reach 10 flat next
year. Broughton, the crack broad lumper,
was not in good form, and his distance,
21 feet and 3-10. was considerably below
his work of last year.

KINGS OF THE KITSCHEN
WILL PREPARE A FEAST
THE hour of the epicure approaches. It is viewed iri. the prospective
by those of sensitive palate as the jolly tar looks' forward to his Christr
mas jag:. Its position in the cycles of time has not yet been determined,
but it is sure to find a place soon after an eventful twelfth day of May,
when JudK% Paingerfield will 'quote a chapter 6f Blacksto'ne and liberate the
treasury of the Societe Cullnaire Cosmopolite de Secours Mutuels â¢ de- San Â°
Francisco. â¢ â¢ . â¢
Americanized and briefly stated, the last nine words mean a society -of
cooks, whose members will do the drama that will. bring smiles and gjadness
to the epicure. In 187S it was organized, with 100 of the'etite chefs of San
Francisco on the charter roll. Time has played sad. havoc "in its ranks "since
then, and to-day but ten of the original tenth part of a tho.usand respond to *
the fall of the gavel. This condition of affairs has produced -a .desire on the ,
part of the lonely ten kings of the culinary department to' disband, a,nd herein
lies the first chapter of thÂ« story" .' ; V . . .'.' .;
The society was 1 ushered into existence as a corporation and was attended c
by due process of law. It must "submit to a similar legal' treatment In or
der to disorganize. The fact that considerable money is'tied up in the treas
ury and cannot be touched until the corporation ceases to exist has caused '
the members to resort to the courts. The matter, therefore, will be "handled
by Judge Daingerfield on May 12, and the surplus coin turned Into twenty,
itching palms. Instead of dropping it into the deep recesses of their pock-'
ets the chefs will at once institute another treasury for the purpose of giving â¢
a royal banquet. . ' â  ...."â â¢
This banquet will be ."one that you read about." Beef a la mode, braized
beef with spaghetti, etc., will be crossed indefinitely from, the bill of fare. ;
On the day of the momentous occurrence the cooks, all of whom are lords
in the salle de cuisine of the well known families and cafes of this city, will I
forget of the caterer's existence, and donning their caps will prepare the
food which will grace the board. Each one will select. his own specialty and !
prepare that with a care and pride which he has never evinced befnre. Then
will their friends gather, the candles be lighted and the feist proceed. !
Those who will be fortunate enough to secure invitations are sure to be ,
the objects cf envy of the community. It is safe to say that the spread '
will be even more sumptuous than those' enjoyed by one of royal blood. â¢ The ,
cooks will display their- years of experience with results that perhaps have '
never been felt on the palate before. ;

injunction heretofore issued to restrain
the police from breaking into the race
course of the corporation and carrying
away law breakers and evidence to se
cure their conviction. When this injunc
tion was issued the hands of the police
were tied. Later a modification of the in
junction was made by Presiding Judge
Daingerneld which gave the police au
thority to enter the grounds if they be
lieved a breach of the law was being or
was about to be committed. As it was
with but little difficulty that the police
could bring themselves to believe that t
crime wus being committed or was about
to be committed, and the belief never
proved erroneous, the modification gave
the police practically the same freedom
enjoyed prior to the issuance of the origi
nal injunction.
The Jockey Club went into court and
endeavored to pet aside the modification
of the injunction on various systems of
reasoning, and during the hearing of this
question a motion was made on behalf
of ihe police to dissolve the original in
junction and set the case for trial on
questions of fact. The motion on behalf
;;ts been granted. Judge
Murasky has dissolved the injunction and
net April U as the date of trial. In its
opinion the court says that if upon the
bearing it appears that the club is a law
respecter, and that the police wrongfully
trespass,- â <' upon its property to its irre
parable injury, full relief will bo accorded.
Imm:m the evidence In the hands of the
police it Is obvious that the club will ex
perience considerable difficulty in prov
ing that it is not a law breaker and that
it comes into tho court of equity before
the chancellor with "clean hands," hence
the hearing is only necessary to forever
establish the status of the club and its
riKhts in this community.
In full. Judge Murasky*s opinion reads:
The matters before the court for de
termination are: A motion to set aside
the modification of the original in
junction; a motion to dissolve the in
junction as modified; a motion to
strike out parts of the answer, and a
motion to set the cause for trial.
By the injunction, as it stands, the
defendants are restrained from enter
ing upon the premises of plaintiff
without its permission or unless they
have reasonable cause to believe that
an offense is being committed or is
about to be committed thereon. The
original order restrained them from
entering without permission of plain
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 2, 1899.
tiff or "without warrant or process of
law."
Upon the argument it appeared,
among a number of incidental prob
lems, that there are involved in the
case chiefly two questions:
1. Is a peace officer empowered by
statute or by virtue of his office to en
ter forcibly, without warrant, upon
places such as a racecourse when he
has reasonable grounds to believe that
an offense is beinc or is about to be
committed?
2. Will a court of equity interfere?
1. The modified injunction permits
the defendants to enter upon plain
tiff's premises upon belief that an of
fense is being committed, whether
the offense be a felony or a misde
meanor. Though the word offense,
used In the modified injunction, in
cludes felonies as well as misdemean
ors, and though defendants would be
justified in entering where a felony
was being committed, it is apparent
from the pleadings and the arguments
of counsel that the "belief" of de
fendants was as to the commission of
a misdemeanor.
To state that a police officer can ar
rest for a misdemeanor only when
armed with a warrant, or when the
misdemeanor is committed in his
presence, is merely to state what has
been the common law, without vari
ance, for centuries, what is the stat
ute law of this commonwealth, and
what is a principle embodied in every
set of grievances put forth by the
people from the Bill of Rights to our
Declaration of Independence. I do not
understand that this rule is denied.
Under our statutes when a person
whc has committed a misdemeanor in
the presence of an officer, or who is
sought upon a warrant, is within a
house, such police officer may forcibly
enter such nouse, after having de
manded admittance and stated his
business. It is claimed by the plain
tlff that these restrictions upon the
power of the police are not extended
to places where the public gather,
even though such places are private
property; but the research of coun
sel, and it has been most, diligent, has
failed to find In the statute law of the
State any provision which distin
guishes the rights of a peace officer
when seeking to enter a place such
as is owned by plaintiff from tho^e
he has when demanding admission to
a house. I am inclined to believt,
though, for present purposes, it is not
necessary so to decide, that in this
State a peace officer is a creature of
the statute, having no existence and
no powers except by virtue of the
*t:itute.
Numerous illustrations of the la
ment able state of things that would
occur wore audiences permitted to
gather for the purpose of viewing pro
hibited performances without being
subjected to intrusion by the police
have been cited; but such audiences
would be unlawful assemblies, as de
fined by the Penal Code, and unlawful
asembliee being crimes against the
I<< a.cc, may be dispersed by the police
without warrants.
2. The gist <>f the case as thus far
presented, however, is the right of the
plaintiff to an injunction pendente
lite.
The plaintiff comes into a court of
equity, where may come only those
who are innocent of fraud, of crime,
of a violation of law, who are of pure
consciences concerning the matter in
dispute, and asks to restrain a depart
ment of the municipal government
from performing certain acts which
the plaintiff alleges will work irre
parable Injury to' it, and which that
department has no right to perform.
The plaintiff assorts its Innocence and
its good intent. The defendants allege
that plaintiff is a wrongdoer, a violator
of the law. The plaintiff asserts by
reason of the acts of the defendants
its business has been greatly impaired
and that unless defendants are re
strained from continuing their arts
the injury to its property will be irre
parable. The defendants allege that
the Injury to plaintiffs husiness has
arisen "from the fact that plaintiff can
not continue in its violations of the
law. Plaintiff says the presence of the
police deters its patrons from visiting
the racecourse. The defendants assert
that the absence of poolselling is the
absence of the principal inducement
offered by the plaintiff to its patrons,
and for that reason they remain away.
These are the principal issues present
ed by the complaint and the answer of
affidavit of defendants.
Where greater injury will he inflicted
upon plaintiff than upon the defendant
by the dissolution of an injunction
pendent c lite, the injunction should be
maintained until the final hearing.
"Where the contrary result will occur
the Injunction should be dissolved. If
the plaintiff's allegations are true it
will suffer much loss, unless defend
ants are restrained, and defendants
will puffer none by the injunction. If,
however, the allegation of defendants
Is true, that plaintiff is a law-breaker,
then the injury to the municipality
from the continuance of the injunction
would be greater than any that can be
compensated by money,' and therefore
greater than any the plaintiff can
Many of the equities of the bill are
denied by defendants. It is denied that
force was used in entering, or that the
entry was without permission, or that
there was any interference, except
with those actually found in the com
mission of a public offense. WherÂ©
Fiu-h an issue is raised it is to be pre
sumed at least for the purposes of a
motion to dissolve, that the municipal
officers acted within the scope of their
authority. Under the circumstances, I
believe that the injunction should he
dissolved until a hearing upon the fact
is had. If upon the hearing it appears
that plaintiff is a law respecter, and
that defendants wrongfully trespassed
upon its property to its irreparable in
jury, full relief will be accorded.
The motion to strike out portions of
the answer will be denied. That the
matter may be speedily determined
the cause will be set for April 3, 1899,
for trial, provided such day will suit
the convenience of counsel.
It is. therefore, ordered:
1. That the injunction pendente lita
be dissolved.
2 That the motion to strike out por
tions of the answer be denied.
3 That the motion to set cause for
trial be granted for April 3, ISW.
Attorney Garret McEnerney, who, with
Judge Murphy, represented the police,
paid after he had examined the decision
that hÂ» believed the decision of Judge
Murasky ended the controversy. As the
riKht of the club to seek relief in a court
of equity rested solely, according to the
opinion of the court, upon a question of
fact, which was easily pstablished In
favor of thf> police, Mr. McEnernpy is of
the opinion that there is no escape for
the club undr-r the anti-pool ordinance,
and that it must either refrain from fur
ther selling or suffer the consequences.

BIG SALE OF OREGON
SUGAR PINE LANDS
BOOTH-KELLY LUMBER COM
PANY THE PURCHASER. â 
Means the Launching of a Big Enter
prise in Lane County and Rail
road Development.
One of the' biggest deals in timber lands
in Oregon made for some time was con
summated Friday in the purchase .by the-
Booth-Kelly Lumber Company from the
Southern Pacific Company, through W.
H. Mills, of a large tract in I>ane County,
the consideration being $121,299. This sale,
is the first, of several that have been under
consideration between the parttes named,
for some time. It is probable that be.fore
the season is over lands to the aggregate
amount of $300,000 may be transferred. =
The lands purchased are tributary : to
Mill Creek, and. are located .east of and
about sixteen miles from Coburg, the ter
minus of the Oregonian Railway East
Side, Which runs out from Portland. It
is the purpose of the Booth-Kelly Lum
ber Company to construct a railroad from
their newly acquired iands to Coburg, and
the road may ultimately, be extended
westward to connect with the main line
of the California and Oregon Railroad,
about five miles north of Eugene City.
The latter project will involve some ex
pensive bridge work, as several large,
streams noar the forks of the Willamette
will have to be crossed. *
Should all the lands under negotiation,
be sold, which is highly probable, the"
company will become the owner- of about
40,000 acres, comprising mostly sagar
pine. for which there is a ready market
at nl! times. :â '-. ;--7*
Frank Buck of Vacavllle, Cal., is .one- of.
the large stockholders in the company.
This enterprise means the employment of
a large amount of capital and of a large
number of men. The company expects to
cut a million feet of lumber during the
season.

" What Think Ye of Christ?"
JKe GKrist of Romar\ Gatkoiicism.
By father Newell of St. Dor^inic^s.
WHAT think ye of Christ? This
was the question put by Jesus of
Nazareth to ihe leaders of the
Jewish people. And he challenged
them to answer according to their own
ear-red law and prophetic writings. Tlv y
answered, indeed. With a half truth, that
he was the son of David. But Jesus ar
pwod: "Why. then, flop? David in spirit
rail him Lord, saying. The Lord B)
my Lord. Sit thOU at my ripht hand til! 1
make thy enemies thy footstool? If David
tlifn call him Loni. how is he hi.- son?"
â  ey could nnt answer him.
This same question", the test of all truth.

thut Jesus of Nuzareth is the second j> r

carnate in our human nature. And for
this toaening the church has. bestdi a the

celebrated the ' resurrection of the
Lord as Jesus Christ. True and interest
ing as the accounts are of the bodily res
urrection, yet. as a matter of history,
they are comparatively of little value' to
us unless they symbolize spiritual things;
a resurrection in which we can all have
part, here and now.
What *we have concerning the resurrec
tion in the Gospels represents the rising
of spiritual goodness in our hearts from
the, dead' things that oppose. The resur
rection stateâ life eternal, angelhoodâ is
jiot attained but by the way of Geth
spmane, the cross and the sepuleherâ
through what these words spiritually sig
nify. .
The four accounts of the resurrection,
and the differences in these accounts rep
rfpont the methods whereby spiritual
goodness rlsos in vnr hearts: the differ
ences are r the different processes whereby
mm become spiritually minded; which
vary according to hereditary tendencies,
social surroujidingtf, education and the
â  habits of life. The Lord's resurrection
typifies our regeneration. Every little cir
ciimptancv, every event which attended it
was figurative of some change of the state
hr:vo a* lav.-, according to which he should
die. recmis<? he made himself the Son of
God." This was the theocratic law against
hijih treason to God, the real kirc: of tbo
Jews; but In. the application of this law to
there was a previous question
which should have : "!i examined; that

which ;i!l the predicted signs indicating
his aoVvent were verified, and hie divine
character 'and mission fully establish -d
hlng, his life and his merciful
and mighty works.
This question the leaders of the Jews
obbtinately refused" 'â  to examine, even
though J;st;s repeatedly challenged th"m

of man's mind or the affections of his
heart; -represented the living principles of
truth and goodness rising from the dead
things of evil and -falsity.
Paul says: "I eouÂ»leÂ§&ll things loss for
the excellency of thr> knowledge of Christ
Jesus; that I may mow him and the
power of his resurrection." "In Christ
Jesus I die daily," he also said, and from
that death he.wns daily resurrected into
newness of Hfe. "If ye live after the flesh
ye -shall die; but if through the spirit ye
do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
live." So the living, spiritual things we
are to seek are not to be found In ' tho
propensities of the body, the sensual
things of the natural mind, what delights
the eye or the ear, or any of the senses,
but In those things whicli are risen above
the animal nature and pertain to the prin
ciple!* of spiritual truth and goodness.
When we have these living things In us
we' have eternal or everlasting life; we
are passed from death unto life.
When the Lord's spirit is In vs â his
spirit of love-, which comes into the truth
we ob.eyâ he causes us to come up out of
the graves of a sensual life and brings
us into a higher life than the animal.
Then we first become human, made in the
image and likeness of God. His image, as
his truth, is. in our minds, and his like
ness, as his love, is in our hearts. Thus
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 2, 1899.
through regeneration we become living
souls, having all things which act against
the spiritual under our feet.
'Â« Beck not the living among the dead.
Seek spiritual truth and goodness, which
j call us from the graves of religious in
f difference and insensibility. Seek a new
\ mind and a new heart: rise Into a spiritual
, life, out of doctrines and forms: rise to
, genuine love to God, which manifests
, itself in love to man.
t As truth and love are resurrected in
.our external lives we shall become con
scious of heavenly joy, compared to which
. earthly riches rind pleasures are as dross
I compared to gold; and He will evermore
! be cur lipht and joy, and will continually
, say unto us, "Peace I leave with you;
' my peace I give unto you."
JKe Christ of Ur\itariamsrr\.
Ey Rev. Mir>ot J Savag?.
T7 DO not believe in the deity of Christ
nor In "miracles" attributed to him
I that set aside natural laws. Similar
miracles have been recorded of other
great men, so they cannot bo good Â«vi
- .if any one's AUty. There have boon
wonder-working men in all nations, and'
miracles have boen attributed to all of
them. These beliefs nro hold without
proof as. sacred traditions. In tho- N. w
Ti Btament it is written. "No man hath
seen God ;tt any time." This is in con
tradiction to the Old Testament, in which
many persons claim to have seen God.
In f.no instance God came down and ale
roast, veal with Abraham; in another he
.walked in the garden of Eden' until he
found Adam and talked with him,
All things are marvels. A little pool
shows God &s truly as the Niagara Falls.
The divine exists in nature and in man
as it did in Christ. Perhaps it docs not
differ in kindâ only in degree. A stone
shows as much of the divine nature as
it is capable of holding. The Sioux In
dian reveals something of God., as much
as his nature permits. But the capacity
of man to hold and to reveal the divine
nature is constantly increasing. Bibles do
not create rrllglon; religion writes bibles.
Many religions have their Biblesâ as sa
cred to them as ours to up. They are all
inspired, in a broad sense of the word.
They represent the aspirations of man and
the divine element in him; they prove his
upward tendencies; they show that hia
nature is essentially religious.
Christ demonstrated this divine nature
by his life to a greater degree than other
men. I do not believe that In any of his
works he disregarded those natural laws
which are God's methods of carrying on
his work. God unfolds himself in an or
derly manner. He works gradually and
through ma.n's comprehensive nature.
Possibilities are latent In all men of ex
periencing moments of exaltation, of di
vine inspiration. At these moments won
ders happen. Some are cured of diseases;
others are converted and forsake evil.
God Is infinite power; man, partaking of
his nature, can reveal God; but only
through himself and according to his in
dividual capacity. Ido not believe in the

By Miss C. S. Bradsbaw.', C D. S.
CHRISTIAN Scientists lrarn that
the Christ is the revelation or man
ifestatlon of God's power, presence
and character. This true and di
vine Idea of Cod is not limited by time,
but Is eternal with God, and was pro
sonied to the work! through the man
Jesus. This made him the way-shower
to thai divine perfection which is to be
attained by each one when he overcomes
the errors of mortal existence, which ap
pear as sin, sickness and deathâ whateve*
is unlike God.
Jesus taught, and his followers proved
flfvi!. Every man in time will be de
veloped to the fulln< sa of his divine and
spiritual nature. I like Dr. Lyman Ab
bott'a definition, "Man is God minus In
finity; God is man pins infinity." But
this Is not dogma. I hold my mind open
to new light and conviction.

Easter love
Speclal to The Sunday Call.
Copyrighted, 1899.
HERE is no day in the entire
5 twelvemonth, 'be it feast or fast
day, which is richer in those quaint
omens, superstitions, divinations,
rhymes, sayings, legends, etc.,
which go to make up what is gen-
erally known as folk lore than Eas
ter, the "queen of festivals," ennobled by
the thought of Christ, the true Paschal
Sacrificial Lambâ tHe first fruits from the
dead.
The festival of Easter owes its origin
to the fact that the early fathers of the
church, in their endeavors to convert the
pagans of ancient Rome to the Christian
faith, met their greatest difficulty in the
attachment of those heathen to their pa
gan festivals, rites and ceremonies. There
is nothing to which the attachment of the
people of all nations is stronger than to
days which they have been accustomed to
celebrate as Joyous and religious festivals.
The early fathers found It impossible to
convert not only the .Romans but the
heathens of all nations if they insisted
upon the absolute abandonment of their
heathen holidays. They wisely deckled,
therefore, that the host course was to re
tain the least objectionable of these and
so to modify them that they should have
a Christian instead of a heathen signifi
cance.
It is to this wise policy on the part of
the early fathers of the church that we
are indebted for that moat beautiful of
festivals, Christmas day, which was de
signed to replace the old Roman Saturna
lia or Feast of Saturn, and the great fes
tivals wh'.'h the ancient Germanic and
Celtic races were accustomed to celebrate

Easter may orcur a? early as March 22,
or as late as April 25. Very few persons
can give any Intelligent account why thi.
1p the case. <>r of the rule by which the
date on which Easter shall fall in any
given year is fixed. To comprehend this
matter" it must be borne In mind that Eas
ter Is not only the substitution of a Chris
tian festival for a heathen one. but thft It
is analogous to th* "Passover" feast of
the Jews, which, like the- Christian Eas
ter, is preceded by a fast similar to the
Christian Lent. When the Christian Eas
his teaching true, that the power to over
come the world, flesh and all evil is Go<s
given to every one who will keep his
commandments. The prophets spiritually
discerned the Christ, the Messiah, before
the time of Jesus. And after the fulfill
ment of prophecy comes the later revela
tion of "the larger Christ." the spiritual
idea of infinite love, which will unite all
mankind as one fold under one shep
herd.
The signs of this transformation greet
us on every side, where there is the see
ing eye and hearing ear.
The Christ the Christian Scientists ac
cept is the living truth of God. The "So

effectual help; to open the pri?nn doors,
to unloose the bands of wickedness and
to let the oppressed go free and to bring
peace and harmony to our present
thought.
This truth heals the sick to-day and re
forms the sinner through an enlightened
understanding of the science of its spirit
ual law. Jesus cave to his disciples an
understanding of the Scriptures in all
that pertained to himself. And this spirit
ual understanding r 'f the Scriptures is he^
ing revealed to-day through the teach
ings of Christian science. It is work
rather than words that prove the truth
we hold.
The Christian Scientist has undertaken
to follow Christ as a practical example
in life and works, and because lie is do
ing so with some measure of success is
the only reason why ho has gained thÂ«
thoughtful consideration of intelligent
people.
thus revealed himself In nature through
the works of creation; he has revealed
himself by the brooding of his spirit in
the hearts of men; he has pre-eminently
revealed himself by dwelling in one
human life and filling that life full of
himself.
This is John's statement of the divinity
of Christ, and It accords with Christ's
statements, such as "I am in the Father
and the Father in me."

ter was first established it was celebrated
at the same time as the Jewish "Pass
over," which commemorated the passing
over of the houses of the children of Is
rael by the destroying angel when he
smote the Egyptians, but there soon arose
between Christians of Jewish and those of
gentile descent a fierce dispute as to
whether Easter should he celebrated im
mediately at the termination of Lent,
which then ended on the fourteenth day
of the moon, without regard to the day of
the week, or whether Easter should be
celebrated only on the first day of the
week, commonly known as Sunday. Chris
tians of Jewish descent maintained the
former, and celebrated Easter on which
ever one of the seven days of the week
occurred next after the fourteenth day of
the moon on which Lent always termi-/
nated, while Christians of gentile descent
maintained that Easter could only be cele
brated on the first Sunday after the four
teenth day of the moon. Thus for many
years two Easter days were annually cele
brated by the two opposing factions, ex
cept when it -chanced that the day follow
ing the fourteenth day of the moon was
Sunday, when both bodies of the disput
ants kept It on the same day.
These differences were harmonized in
the year 325 by the Council of Xicaea,
which decreed in favor of keeping Easter
only on Sunday. But even then there was
no rule for determining the date of the
festival in different countries', and though
the Roman church decreed that Easter
should be the first Sunday after the four
teenth day of the calendar moon, which
happens on or next after March 21. and
which is the vernal equinox, it was not
until the year A. D. 541 that the Fourth
Council of Orleans decreed that Easter
should be kept by all branches of the
church on the same day according to that
rule, and it was not until the year A. D.
CG9 that the acceptance of that decree be
came universal in both the Eastern and
\\ . Btern churches. The same rule for de
termining the date of East r continues to
1,, observed at the present time.
Many of the old folk customs associated
with Easter are meant to bo typical of the
rising of our Savior from the dead. One
of the quaintest of these is one observed
in Warwickshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire
and other counties of England, which is
called "lifting" or "heaving." The men
lift or heave the women on Easter Sun
day, and the women do likewise to the
men on the following day. This lifting or
heaving is performed by two men or two
women clasping each other's wrists in
such a way as to form with the backs of
their hands a seat, upon which the person
to be heaved sits down. He or she is then
raised and lowered several times, and
often carried a considerable distance.
This was intended to be symbolical of the
Savior's rising from the grave.
Apropos of this custom, a capital anec
dote is told of the late Derm Stanley. A
few years before his death he was obliged
to remain for an hour or two at the inn
of a Lancashire town on Easter Monday,
and his amazement can scarcely be imag
ined when three or four buxom women en
tered his apartments and announced that
they had come to lift him.
"To lift me." exclaimed the good man.

saya that the Christiana who derive
jjall their opinions of Jesus from the
*New Testament do not so much as
know\vhen he was bom. According to the
agnostic's expressed views on the subject,
Luke was mistaken when he wrote that
Christ was born while Cyrenlus was Gov
ernor because Cyrenius was not appoint
ed until after the death of Herod.
Comparing the gospel according to St.
Matthew and the gospel according to St.
Luke, Mr. Ingersoll says that the former
recounts- twenty-seven generations be
tween David and Jesus, while Luke gives
forty-two. Matthew says that Joseph's
father was Jacob, while Luke says that
Heli was Joseph's father; therefore, ar
pr.^s the agnostic, either or both these
writers wrote falsely.
"How is it established that Christ was
the son of God?" asked Ingersoll. "It Is
said that Joseph was told so in a dream
by an angel. How could Joseph know that
he had been visited in a dream by an an
gel? Could he know that the visitor was
an angel? It all occurred in a dream.
Joseph was asleeft. What is the testimony

still if the theological Christ had never

reshoff shipyards at Bristol, R. 1.,
for a now cup defender 1b being :
built.
It is almost as hard to get inside
â¢ the yards as It Is to see the Czar
i>f Russia. Guards are everywhere; at
the ite stand several; at different parts
of the . yards are several more, and an
nrmy guards the portals of the shop
where Morgan's new racing yacht is be
. .ii!t.
But in pite of all this, people get in
ar.d britiÃ out the information they wish.
And as it happens, this is the informa
tion wanted by the public.
When the prospects for an international .
yacht race for the America's cup became
a fact, :;nd the probability of building a
new crafl t<> represent the New York
Yncht. Club formed the principal toi of
conversation among yachtsmen. Designer
Nwt Herreshoff made the statement that.
Fhould ho bo commissioned to build the
new boat, he was prepared to guarantee
nn increase of speed over the Defender
of 1595 of six minutes over a thirty-mile
course. From reliable data that have
: been â¢ eived from yachtsmen who have
kept in close touch with C. Oliver Iselin
- and hers who have had access to the
yard where the new yacht Is being built
- it can he stated thr.t when the big cup
defender is tuned up to concert pitch she
will make good the prophecy of the noted
designer.
Nearly three months aeo a well-known
naval architect dd thai he thought Her
res.hoff would probably take the lines of
the Defender ns a basis upon which to
work, and that an increase of -:>.-, could
be evolved from her model by the simple
process of lowering and augmenting the
amount of lead In her keel, thereby in
creasing the draught of the vessel and
giving her a greater amount of stahiltty.
This improvement alone would give
great carrying capacity, and it will
be remembered that it was by such im
â  provements that greater speed was ob
tained In the Defender when compared
to the Vigliant and Colonla.
Trustworthy Information has '. been
gleaned that Herreshoff has worked
mainly on these lines, as a comparison
with the principal dimensions of the De
fender will show:
The over-all length of the new boat will
fee 131 feet 4 inches, or 7 feet 4 inches
longer, than the champion of ]SPS. She
will also have eleven and a half Inches
more beam, one foot greater draught and
nearly 2MO more square feet of duck in
her workii i sails. She will have a trifle
more displacement than the old Defender.
Her complete sail spread will not be far
from 12,500 square feet.
. Tobin bronze Â«nd nickeled steel are the
polo materials used in the construction of
the hull of the new defender, the latter
being used for the topsides, with the un
derbody of bronze. The experiment of
tho Defender nas proved that aluminum
:ls not the proper thing for topsides of a
: big sailing yacht. It is compelled to
.-'bear a great deal of strain and becomes
Weakened through the action of salt
.-water and air, and is especially bad whon
â  used in conjunction with another metal
' that will generate galvanic action. For
this reason iminum has been discarded
in- tho construction of the new boat, and
through the extra weight of the steel as
compared to the lighter metal her hull
\v-iH be mewhat heavier than that of
:tlie I nder.
â Tobin bronze, which will sheathe the
rbody ot wetted Burface, Is the light
est and smoothest that the manuiaeturers
h:ivvÂ» as yet made, and it will be riveted
>tb :lh-e frames in the same manner as on
": The Older boat. The bronze will, be put
fjon in five strakos, seven-fortieths of. an
; inch thick, .and the steel topsides will be
worked on in two strakes, each one-quar
t'e-hof-an inch thick." She will not have

In. building the new boat Designer Her
reshoff will -not depart materially from
the design of the Defender. The frames in
i the .waist are tho same size, 3 by 2\i by Vi

are. a'lscr. those that are set up in the over

Fife has not received the greatest oppor
tunity to display his ability in the larg
est class. With the exception of the
Ailsa. which, by the way, is one of the
fastest of the fleet under certain condi
tions, he has not been represented at all
in tho 100-ton class. He is, however, thÂ»
leader in the forty and twenty tonners,
his products having won the largest share
of valuable trophies against yachts by

Sir Thomas Lipton has determined to
spare no money in order to make the
contest next October the most popular
ones that have ever been sailed for that
will-o'-the-wisp, the- America's cup, and
in order to see the races from the best
point of view has purchased the Aegusa,
said to be one of the handsomest steam
yachts ever built on the Clyde.
Many other prominent European
yachtsmen will voyage across the Atlan
tic to view the races, and several of tha
mopt important yachts in British waters'
are expected here, among them the new
schooner Rainbow and another big two
sticker from Watson's board. With the
Colonia, Quissetta and a few others of
the home fleet in commission it is hardly
likely that they will carry many of thÂ©
big trophies back to old Albion.
CHAMPION
FISH STORY.
THE Two O'clock Hunting and Fish
ing -Club, which has already made
a record for some novel possum
hunts and fishing exploits, held
a meeting last week, at the sug
gestion of Colonel Richard M.
Johnson. The colonel proposed to
present a fine bamboo fishing rod for
the best hunting or fishing story told
by any of the members, barring him
self. The colonel is 'â¢away up in G" when
it comes to story-telling, and he thought
he would encourage some of the younger
members of the club in the entertaining
art of detailing, graphically, some inter
esting incident or novel experience con
nected with a fishing or hunting trip.
Accordingly, all the boys assembled,
after due notice of the purpose of the
meeting, last Monday night, says the St.
Louis Globe-Democrat, each one deter
mined to carry away that handsome
fishing rod.
Promptly at 8 p. m. all were present.
George Stumm jollied everybody until ho
was dared to start the ball rolling with
the first story.
"Well. I don't mind." said George, "but
I'd rather hear some of the other stories,
because I'm afraid you'll all quit when
I'm through."
"All right. Mr. Stumm." replied Colonel
Johnson; "you have the floor."
"All of you know where Gilead's Slough
is. don't you, boys? Of course you do.
Lots of you have ftsheu there, l know.
It's a fine place to catch orappie. and
bass, too, if you only know how to do It.
I'm on, and I'll just let you into the se
cret by relating my experience up there
with some friends last summer.
"We were guests of Calhoun County
Club and were eager to make a good
catch of crappie and bass, but somehow
or other the first day we could hardly
catch enough to cook for supper. The
next morning we all turned out early, de
termined to make a 'killing.' as sporting
men say. Up to noon we had only nine
teen crappie between the lot of us. and
a big feeling of disgust seized all of the
boys but your Uncle George. Not one
would return to the lane after dinner,
concluding to have a social game where
the breezes swept through the cool rooms
of the club house.
"I hadn't given up yet. I had seen
pome old green frogs blinking at me
along the shore of the slough, so I con
cluded to take along with me a little 22
--.caliber rifle that was at the club house,
and knock the eyes out of some of the
croakers if they showed up during the
afternoon while I was watching those red
corks of mine. I took a tow-headed
country boy along to handle the boat and
by 2 p. m. I was at it again. Not a fish
but a few small crappic rewarded my pa
tience up to 5 o'clock. Then I began to
get that feeling of disgust myself, but as
I was looking down in the water I sa"w
a couple of big bass looking up at me.
I was leaning over the side of the boat
at the tim-e, when a large pearl button
that was on my blue flannel shirt dropped
into the water. No sooner had ft struck
the surface than a splash of spray was
dashed into my face. Both of those
durned pass leaped clear out of the water
in. their eagerness to get that button.
" 'Ah, ha!' I exclaimed; 'now I know
â what you want. I'll give you all there i.Â«*
left on this old outing shirt. I will cast
pearls before bass until they can't rest.*
and I did. I placed a button on my hook
and dropped it down deep, where I could
see several bass. They would riot touch
it. Then I let it- go to the bottom, but
the bass only- looked askance and backed
away. I saw those bass were not pearl
divers, so I began trailing, but not a sin
gle strike. In utter disgust I took thÂ«
button off the hook and cast it out ten
feet. At least half a dozen bass just
churned the water into buttermilk in theii
eagerness to get it.
"Then I determined to try an experi
ment. I tied a button on my line, after
removing hook, sinker and float, and
gently cast out. Without a single skit
ter a game old bass had it. He hung on
until I got him almost up to the boat,
then let go and shied off. 'Wise old bass
of Gilead's,' I thought; 'you know when
a fishhook is in sight. Now, I'll fool
you.' I handed the rod to young Wilkin
son, and instructed him to cast out thÂ»
buttoned line w-hen I told him to.
"I picked up that little 22 Stevens as
the boy tossed out the button. Oh, what
a beauty nailed my shirt ornament. He.
was a bulldog in tenacity, refusing even
to take a down shoot, but Just shook
away at the button like a terrier. The
boy ralsÂ«d the bass' head above tha
water, and I cracked away with the rrfl>.
In an instant J saw that bass turn belly
up."
At this point in the recital the other
members of the> club began to fidget and
make audible groans of incredulity, but
it never feazed Stiimm in the least.
"Another and another bass was served
in the same way," continued GeoTge.
"and when it was too dark to shoot we
picked up thirty bronze daisies; all over
two pounds in weight. And what do you
think, boys? Every blamed one of thÂ»
thirty bass was shot right in the eye." \
Colonel Johnson arose, and, in a digni
fied manner, said: "Gentleman, I movÂ£ â¢"
this contest be closed. You are all pretty
good liars, and I'm no slouch myself, T>ut 0
we must all take off our hats to Georgie,"
and they did, and the colonel presented
the rod with a profound bow, but wit ho
out a remark. The club was wetting that
rod at 2 o'clock Tuesday morning. . ;

Last year the two Greater New York

a strong ti itn requires Beveral seasons,
and therefore the Baltimore club, which

In the country, was transferred to Brook

a better team should be put Into St. Louis.
These changes are believed to he for the

possibilities cf the whole country Into con

It is this exileâ this having to per

that mak^s our country bo grand to us
and our respect for its flag so profound.
The flag, too, has a personality to us.
It represents the majesty of our Gov
ernment of the people and their great
power. As the symbol of freedom's
home, it excites enthusiasm wherever
it is shown abroad, and in the hearts
of its freeman defenders there is felt a
love and admiration for what it repre

those who live where these privileges
are not so esteemed as by those of us
who, accustomed to long service
abroad, are able to compare these ad

ri'-.l off the championship, remains prac
tically the same as last year. Its players
are well seasoned, to be depended upon,
and play together. Individual and star
playing is well and pleases the
grand stand, but to insure success a team
must work together. The patron's cry to
"line it out" Is a strong incentive to a
player to make a hit in a double sense,
but a buni or sacrifice is often prolific
of better results than a vicious attempt to
knock the ball over the fence. It Is the
thorough unity and good field manage
ment of the Bostons, and the same may
be said of the Baltimore team, that have
enabled these teams to retain first and
second places for several successive sea
sons. The Bostons' pitching staff, one of
the best in the league, will remain the
same as last year, with Kid Nichols as
the particular star. In .Tenney, Lowe,
Collins and Long the infield will prove a
stone wall.

Brooklyn to Have a Star Team.
The Brooklyn team of IS9D will be a hard
aggregation to beat out. It will contain
probably more star players than any
other nine in the league, and great results
are looked for. There. is no denying It,
the patrons of the game in Greater New
York are tired of being -represented by
two teams which made no better showing
than did the Brooklyns and New Yorks'
last year. They want a team which will
play good, snappy baseball.
-A I baseball enthusiast said . to me the
other day: "Building up the Brooklyn
team, will be sure to boom the game in
this part of the country. /-.What we want
is a team we can be proud of; one we,
can do some yelling over. If the boys
beaten at the finish we want to haye
the reception and entertainment of our
officers.
The great city of Yeddo was laid out
dally during our stay into interesting
districts for visits of inspection.
The routes along which we were es
corted were, as a rule, closely packed
with natives, who were curious to see
the white foreigner for the first time
in their lives. But in no instance dur
ing these excursions was any incivility
or rudeness manifested, though on all
sides there was that natural curiosity
to get a closer look at the long-haired
white man. In this the pretty Japanese
woman was, as a rule, more conspicu
ous than the man, and I dare say there
are many matrons living now in Tokio
who can remember a bright button
conferred in response to some roguish
importunity.
Painful Forebodings.
After our mission had been com
pleted and the presents from our Gov
ernment to that of Japan had been
landed, we started on our return to
Chinese waters in the winter of 1860-61.
Reaching Hongkong, the United States
Minister, Mr. Ward, had authority to
return to the United States, and the
Niagara was directed to take him to
India, and thence to the mouth of the
Red Sea, where he took steamer for
Europe, and ultimately home.
This duty performed, the Niagara
proceeded from Aden to the Comoro
Islands, northwest of Madagascar, and
lastly to Cape Town, in South Africa.
Our voyage home was in length some
what longer than that going out, and
nothing was known of the fall election
that had already taken place, although
there was considerable anxiety on
board among the officers and men, as
our complement included many from
both sections.
On the day of election, however, a
vote was taken on board ship, with the
result that Mr. Lincoln received a ma
jority of the votes cast. Until the shlD
had reached the highlands of Cape Cod.
Massachusetts, we were in utter ig
the satisfaction of knowing that the
other fellows had to hustle to do It. I
have been a regular attendant at the
Polo grounds, but I am of a mind, and
there are thousands just like me, to go
over to Brooklyn if the New Yorks give
us another sample like last year. What
we want is a winning team to represent
the Greater New York."
Teams of Other Cities.
The New Yorks will remain the same
as last year, and they can put up a iirst
class panic of ball, something which will
be hard to beat. George Davis will oc
cupy his old position at shortstop-, and
every one knows the place he holds in
the hearts of the public; they have a
strong Infield, their pitching department
is among the best in the league; so with
the catchers and outfield. Many of the
players are stars â Van Haltren, Tiernan.
Doyle, Gleason, Warner and others.
With two winning teams in Greater New
York, things will hum.
Chicago and Philadelphia will remain
about the same as last year, with possi
bly a few exceptions, and, I think, they
may be depended upon to put up a strong
game.
Cincinnati will also go on the dia
mond with the same team as last sea
son. It would be hard to beat the pitch
ing department, and the men behind it
can give a gilt-edge sample of baseball.
Cleveland and St. Louis will be consid
erably shaken up, probably with first
ciass results.
Pittsburg will retain the same players
as )u>t year, and the rest of the teams
will bear from them. Washington and
Louisville bid fair to make an Improve
ment over last year. There are some
star players among their men and they
should make a good showing.
A team of star players does not neces
sarily make a winning team, but the
presence on the field of one or more rec
ord champions goes far to attract the
public. For instance, a team composed
of men who have led In one or more de
uarituentG will lie a drawing card. The
new Brooklyn team will contain several
iv.en who stood at the top last season.
Keelcr, who held the batting record for
IS!is, will occupy a position in the field,
and the patrons of the game will bo anx
ious to see if a change of climate will ef
fect his work at the bat.
Star Players of the League.
It may be a difficult matter to pick out
the stars of the league; each club has a
few. Of the shortstops Davis, Long nnd
Jennings will probably have little difficul
ty in maintaining their Standing with the
public. Last sens'in th.. following men
stood at the head of the record In their
relative positions, ar.rt they will this year
be pretty equally distributed among the
leading clubs: First base, Beckley, Cin
cinnati; second base, Reitz, Washington;
third base, Wallace, Cleveland; shortstop,
Jennings. Baltimore; center field. Griffin,
Cleveland; right field, Tiernan, New York.
Delahanty, Philadelphia, led in base steal-
Ing and Rltchey, Louisville, in sacrifice
hits. There were a number of other p.lay
norance of the portent of this vote,
taken away off in the China seas.
The absence of ships, however, along
our coasts about the latitude of Cape
Hatteras as we were approaching home
caused painful forbodings lest some
disaster had befallen the country we
loved so well. The mutterings in the
South of the year before in the event of
a certain election caused some anxiety,
and the absence of vessels in regions
where in years gone by they were as
thick as the leaves in Vallombrosa was
held by the older heads to be ominously
significant, but it was not until we
reached the highlands of Cape Cod that
we were to learn the full extent of the
great calamity that was upon up. The
election we had held on board the ship
way off in the waters of China, on the
other side of the globe, was only th^
prrlude of the more general one at
home. As Mr. Lincoln was the choice
of the majority of the officers and men
of the frigate Niagara, so we were to
learn subsequently he was also the
choice of the nation.
Pilot's News.
When off the Highlands a pilot boat
was discovered near by, and the pilot
put off in a boat with his pockets full,
as is customarily done, of the latest
papers. He was awaited with an im
patience that seemed almost painful,
and the moment he had crossed the rail
and reached the gangway he was asked
by the captain, dear old Com McKean,
than in whom no more loyal heart ever
beat for the flag, this question:
"Pilot, what is the news?"
The pilot, Dolliver was his name,
looked around at all standing about the
quarterdeck, apparently amazed at the
question, for what he was about to tell
us as news was quite old to him. and
instead of replying at once to this ques
tion, the- pilot, as so often happens,
asked the captain with some surprise:
"Where in thunder have you come
from, captain?"
When told more polltelv. if less em
ers who were a close Becond, an.l any one
of them may jump to the front in his de
partment this season.
New League Ball Chosen.
The branch of the same in which the
public probaly takes the most interest is
in batting; a good batting contest is a
delight to the faithful rooter's heart. A
plan has been discussed, and will proba
bly be carried out, which will tend to In
crease this feature of the game. It is the
purpose to furnish a special ball to be
used In the league games; a ball which
will contain a greater percentage of rub
ber than those hertofore in use. The re
sult is obvious, and the patrons of base
hall may look for more work on the part
of the fielders.
Another rule has boon adopted to pre
vrr.t a Waste of time and shorten the
frames. The pitcher will not be allowed to
make ;i feint to throw to a base; the mo
tion to throw must be followed by the
actual delivery of the ball to the baseman.
This will doubtless increase the base-
Btealing record.
Changes in the "Umpire System.
An umpire may be fined or suspended
(or a violation of his trust, or may be
removed if the offense is sufficiently ag
gravated. The appointment of an effl-
Btaft of umpires will go far toward
preventing the annoying delays and
breaches of discipline to which the pa
trons of the sport had objected in the
past.
The schedule for this year contains 154
games for each clubâ the same as last
season. This makes the season extend
from April 15 to October 15. Each club
will make four trips and play fourteen
games with every other club.
There has been talk of dropping vari
ous clubs and the reduction of the
circuit to eight teams. The league season
will begin with twelve clubs as hereto
fore, but there may be changes before the
end. All depends on the course of af
fairs during the spring and early sum
mer. The advocates of the eight club
league say that there are enough star
players to make up eight teams that
would make the hottest kind r>f a fight for
each season's honors, but that there are
not enough for twelve good clubs. Of
course a crack baseball player cannot be
made to order. He Is partly the result of
training, but more largely of a combina
tion of quickness, a sure eye. and good
Judgment. These are the essentials of a
successful bas< ball player, whatever his
position, and particularly in th^ batting
department of the game. The minor
leagues and college teams, from
which reinforcements are chiefly drawn,
have not contributed as many men to tho
big teams in the past two or three season*
as they did for some time before. Conse
quently there is the cry of a dearth of
baseball talent. If it proves to be well
founded* the reduction in the number of
major league clubs seems likely to occur,
as it will he more profitable and Interest
ing to have eight star ciubs than twelve
mediocre teams in a larger territory.
EDWARD HANLON,
Manager of the Brooklyn Club,
phatically, by the captain that he had
come from Hongkong, the pilot fol
lowed this information with another
question:
"Ain't you heard nothing at all since
sailing?"
"No," replied the captain. "Nothing
at ail, as we have touched nowhere
since leaving the Cape of Good Hope.
There was no news there when we
sailed."
D.olliver's reply to this assurance 1
shall never forget. It was as forcible as
it was emphatic, and as impressive as
words could possibly make it. even if it
was a little inelegant.
"Well, gentlemen, the country is all
busted to hâ l." .
An Excited Ship's Company.
"While this colloquy was going on be
tween the pilot and the captain, the
ship's company had crowded aft in both
gangways, and. like the officers, wen*
Intensely anxious to hear what the
news might be. What Dolliver had sard
so emphatically had reached their ears,
and had touched their hearts. Tears
started from eyes that were not accus
tomed to weeping, and coursed down
the cheeks of those bronzed old heroes.
It could be soon that a firm resolve to
stick loyally to the old flag that had
floated in honor over their lives and
fortunes had gone deep into their souls,
for almost Immediately every eye was
turned upward toward the peak.' where
the old flag was floating peacefully and
majestically, and intuitively every head
was uncovered in homage.
It was an experience never to be for
gotten, and the sight of those bronzed
old heroes, with heads uncovered to the
dear old flag, taught my young heart
in a few moments a whole volume of
patriotism. I had been born in a slave
holding State, and had been reared sur
rounded by colored children, and was
influenced to some extent by the preju
dices which the institution of slavery
had engendered, but when it became
necessary to decide off Boston harbor
whether the love of State was to be
superior to the love of country, and
my pride in its glories and in its his
tory, there was no trouble after the
sight I had witnessed when pilot Doli
ver came aboard.

Saved Prom the Grave Three Times
By His Wife.
ReroarKable Story of a Choctaw lr)dian CoQderoned to Be
SJ)ot.
WICHITA. Kans., April Lâ
Walla Tonka. a fullblood
Choctaw Indian baseball
player, has been three times
snatched from the grave, as
it were, by his wife. Thrice
within the last two years has Walla
Tonka come nlone to the Indian execu
tion grounds near Eufaula and looked
into his own grave. Then, just as he had
knelt to be shot to death by the execu
tioner, his wife has ridden up with a re
prieve from the Judge.
It is doubtful now whether this In
dian will ever be shot. The Judge who
passed the sentence is dead, the witnesses
are dead and there was little cause in
the first place for his conviction.
In the spring of IS!<7 Tonna attended a
green corn dance on the reservation. His
uncle. I,ampson Young, was also pres
ent, and quite freely did the firewater
flow. Young and his nephew were in love
with the same girl. Tookah Ingamore, a
beautiful Choctaw maiden who had been
away to school. She favored the young
and handsome "Walla Tonka and spurned
the uncouth Young.
The old Indian could not see the beau
tiful girl borne off without some effort
on his part to prevent it. so he challenged
his nephew to a duel, the winner to take
the girl. As a result, Tonka killed him
and for the murder was sentenced to be
phot on August 6.
Then he married Miss Inpamnre, and
later joined a baseball team and gained
much notoriety by touring the country

Baseball
Players and motors in tho national
game are superstitious persons. Many
believe in "hoodoos."' and some of the
rules which they have adopted to ward
off disaster are interesting. The best
rooipos arc as follows:
Under no â  circumstances cross the
roadway in front of a load of empty
barrels.
Tn pass a hunchback ntisrro without
recognition is fatal. He must at all
hazards be. stopped and shaken by the
lmnd, while a. penny Is rubbed upon his
back.
Tt is danperous to pass through a fuft
ncral procession. Walking by the side of
a funeral is permissible and rather fa
vorable than otherwise. It' the time will
permit, it would bo hotter to accompany
the hearse to- the cemetery gate, but ne>
farther.
There are many players who would
faint at the sight of a reri-naired
woman while on their way to a game.
Of all the Kentucky hoodoos a yellow
dog has ever been the most dreaded.
If- a colored : newsboy should happen to
step on the omnibus or streetcar in .
which you are riding, hold on to him.
While playing do not allow a stranger
within your tent or upon your players'
bench.
None of the leading bn.ll players wears
a new uniform when he can avoid doing
so. If the new dress becomes imperative
a well-authenticated rabbit's foot, care
fully tucked away in the lining, may act
as a counter charm.
Many of the most famous batters hold
that disaster will follow if a strange
hand touches the bat. .
A cross-eyed negro is an omen of evil
to the pitcher. It is on record that a
pair of shoes sold by a cross-eyed negro
to one of the Baltimore catchers was re
sponsible for the disaster that attended
his nine through part of a season.
Walk on the right-hand siue of the
way. If by inadvertence you should hap
pen to be on the left hand, â¢ ke three
revolutions to the right before crossing.
No experienced ball player will, Â«-hi!a
traveling, sleep with his feet pointing to
ward his destination.
Do not put the baseballs In the bat
bag.
It's injudicious to talk to a -giTl with
a cast in her eye.
Many players and followers of baseball
would sacrifice a week's growth rather
than meet a clergyman on their way to
a game.
If you are a professional player, by no
means ride on a street car or other cheap
conveyance.
Don't carry an umbrella unless the rain
has started before you leave your home.
Allow no one to intercept or cross im
mediately in front of you on your way to
the ground.â St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
as a condemned yet free man.
As August drew near he returned to hfs
home in the Territory, and on the day
set for the execution he went to the
Choctaw Courthouse. The grave had
been (lug and Tonka knelt before It, so
that his dead body could fall easily into
the pit. Just as the blindfold waj being
adjusted a woman, nounted on a wer_ry
and fagged pony, rode up.
It was Tonka's wife. In her hand sT>.e
waved a reprieve. Tonka wa^ not to be
shot until next- Aprfl. For two days the
woman had been pleading with the Judge.
"When April came innka was again on
hand to be shot. It was to- guard hla
honor that he was so prompt. In the
Choctaw Xation It is a family disgrace
for a man to flee from .death. For the
second time Tonka knelt before his open
grave, and again his wife arrived just
a few minutes before the time when he
would have been shot. This time she
had secured a reprieve for nearly a year
âuntil February 28. 1899..
Tonka again joineu a baseball nine last
summer, but was prompt about going to
be shot, i'he third time he looked into
his grave and his wife came with the re
prieve.
Tonka thinks now his wife is a treas
urr. and says with a smile: "I am really
glad I killed my uncle. It proves how
murh this girl loves me."
The Indian wife looks sad but happy.
"It is my duty," she says, in a meian
choly way. "I caused the duel. I will
save my husband's life.""THROUGH days of Lent

Jackâ Oh, well, they're hard boiled; they wouldn't do much

Estherâ But we don't want to break them; not yet. Here,

Jackâ Esther!
Estherâ Well, are you going to give me the tray?
Jackâ Of course. I don't care for the old tray, 'i only brought
It to get to be with you a moment alone. What's the matter,

about to say. Mr. Manning
Jackâ Oh. drop it, Esther! If you've anything to say, say it,
but that "Mr, Manning" makes me sick.
Esther (coldly)â I should think it would. You haven't heard

Jack (approaching her. She stands with the tray held between
them)â What do you mean?
Estherâ l mean thnt you seem to have been very well enter

r.inrr that the whole evening. I never saw any one have more
attention nr seem to enjoy it hetter.
Jackâ l didn't. Esther. I didn't enjoy it a bit. Hope to die if
I did! But you treated me so queerly and I didn't get any chance
to talk to you until I saw you come in here with the magenta
eggs, and I grabbed up the Nile green ones that were just done,
and came, too, sc's to get to see you a minute. (Leans toward
her.) Esther! Forgive me!

Esther (warningly)â Sh-h ! Some one is coming.
Jack (annoyed, aside) â Confound it!

Jack)â Oh. not at all! We were just getting through. I'll find a
place for this tray and be rieht out.
(Jack turns and shakes his head- at her in a fierce negative
Then exits reluctantly behind Lelia.)
Estherâ That minx! She just made that an excuse to see
what we were doing, and to get Jack out. T didn't want tn in

Jack-Oh. smash the eggs! Don't torture me so, Esther!

I-I-lEAH." the people cried, as Juan Quereno passedâ the cry of
the muleteers, in fact. And this was considered an excellent joke.
I J It had been a joke in the countryside for nearly twenty years; one
tj\ of p< rhaps half a dozen; for tho uneducated mind is slow to com
prehend, and slower to forget. Some one had nicknamed Juan
/ rono the "Mule" when he was at school, and Spain, like Italy
end parts ol Provence, is a country where men have two namesâ the bap
tismal, and the r-o-called. Indeed, the custom is so universal that official
: is must needs take cognizance of it. and grave Government papers
{ire made out in the name of so-and-so, "named the monkey."
. There were, after all, worse by-names in the village than the Mule,
â¢which is, as many know, a willing enough beast if taken the right way.
If taken- In the wrongâ well, one must not take him in the wrong way,
and there is an end of it! A mule will suddenly stop because, it would ap
pear, he has something on his mind and desires to think It out then and
there. And tho man who raises a stick is, of course, a fool. Any one
knows thai There is nothing for It but to stand and watch his ears,
â¢which ar< a little set back, and cry. "Ai-1-ieah," patiently and respectfully,
. until the' spirit moves him to go on. And then the mule mill move on,
elowly at first, without enthusiasmâ a quality which, by the way, is of all
the animals only to be found in the horse and the dog.
The quick-witted who had dealings with Quereno knew, therefore, by
his name what manner of man this was. and dealt with him accordingly.
Juan Quereno was himself a muleteer, and in even such a humble capacity
; as scrambling behind a beast of burden over a rocky range of mountains
. and through a stream or two. a man may make for himself a small repu
â â¢': tatjon in his small world. Juan Quereno was. namely, a Government
muleteer, and carried the mails over nineteen chaotic miles of rock and
river. When the mails were delayed, owing. it was officially announced,
to heavy, snow or rain in the mountains, the delay never occurred on
Quereno's etapa. For nine ars, winter and summer, storm and shine,
... he got his mails through- backward and forward, sleeping one night at
San Celoni, the next at Puente del Rey. Such was Juan Quereno. "a
Btupi enough fellow," the democratic schoolmaster of San Celoni said,
.â with a shrug of his shoulders and a wave of the cigarette which he always
carried half-smoked and unlighted in his fingers.
. :. â¢ The schoolmaster was. nevertheless-, pleasant enough when the Mule.
Clean-shaven and -My, with a shrinking look in his steady black eyes,
esked one evening if he could speak to him alone.
' ."But yesâ amigo!" he replied; "but yes." And he drew aside on the
- bench that stands at the schoolhouse door. "Sit down."
::â ./. â  The Mule sat down, leaned heavily against the wall and thrust out
. first one heavy foot and then the other. Then he sat forward, with his
elbows on his knees, and looked at his dusty boots. His face was tanned
a. deep brownâ a stolid faceâ not indicative of much intelligence perhaps.
rot spiritual, but not bad on the other hand, which is something In a
world that abounds in bad faces. He glanced sideways at the schoolmas
. ter and moistened his lips with his tongue, openly, after the manner of
â â¢â¢the people.
. . "It is about Caterina, e"h?" inquired the elder man.
â¢v â¢ "Yes," replied the Mule, with a sort of gasp. If the Mule had ever been
afraid in his life. it was at thai momentâ afraid, if you please, of a little
democrat of a schoolmaster no bigger than the first class boys, blinking
: through a pair of magnifying spectacles, which must have made the
world look very large, it" one could judge from the effect that they had
. upon his. eyes.
. . the schoolmaster looked up toward the mountains, to the goats poised
there upon the broken ground, seeking a scanty herbage in the crannies.

Kindly enough, afte: r moment, and the Mule drew a deep breath

homes: He was. moreover, a selfish man, and had long cherished the con

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 2, 1899.
"The Mule"
the forest, seeking thoir meat from God, while the charitable, and, it is
even whispered, the priest of the Alcalde himself will at times lay an old
coat or a loaf of bread at tho roadside above the village, and never inquire
who comes to take it.
The Mule himself, it is known, buys more matches than he can ever
burn, so much as six boxes at a time, of those cheap sulphurous wooded
matches that an- made at Barcelona, and the next day will buy more. Tho
Mule, however, is such a silent man that those who are "in the mountains"
make no concealment with him. but meet him (wild, unkempt figures that
appear quietly from behind a great rock) as he passes on his Journeys,
and ask him if he has a match upon him. They sometimes look at the mail
baps Flung across the stubborn back of Cristofero Colon with eyes that
have the hunted, hunpxy look which Oaterina has.
"There is perhaps money in there," they pay.
"Perhaps," answers the Mule, without after-thought.
"It may be a thousand pesetas."
"Perhaps."
And the Mule, who is brave enough where Caterina is not concerned,
cfhietly turns his back upon a man who carries a gun and follows Cristofero
Colon. Tt sometimes happens that he trudges his nineteen miles without
meeting any one. with no companion but h!s mules and his dog. This last
named animal Is such as may be met in Spain or evrn In Franco at any
street cornerâ nut a retriever, nor a foxhound, nor anything ai .ill but a
dog as distinguished from a cat or a goat, living a troubled and uncertain
life in a world that will always crinc" to a pedigree, but has no respect
for nondescripts. It was on these journeys that tine Mule had so much
leisure for thought. For even he could think, perhaps, acccording to his
dim lights. He was only conscious, however, of an ever-Increasing feeling
of a sicknessâ a physical nausea (for ho was of course a mere earthy crea
ture)âat the thought of a possible life wiihout Caterina. And it was at
the end of a grilling day that tho schoolmaster beckoned to him as ho
passed tho sohooihouso and told him that it was settledâ that Caterina
would rnnrr;- him.
"Would you like to see her; she is indoors?" Inquired the bearer of the
tidings.
"No." answered the Mule, after a dull pause. "Not to-night. I have
my mail bags, a* you see."
And he olntterod down the narrow street with a dazed look, as if the
brightness-- nf paradise had flashed across his vision. So it waa settled.
Caterina and the Mule won' to be married, and there had been no love
making, the old women said. And what, they asked, is youth fur. if there
is to be no love-makine? And <;od knows they were right, said the priest,
who heard the remark, who was a very old man himself.
Two days after that the Mule mci Caterina as she was going to the
fountain. He said sood-morniiig. They both stopped, and the Mule looked
into Caterina's eyes and had nothing to say. For he saw something there
which he did not understand, and which made him fool that he was no
better Than Cristofero Colon, scraping and Stumbling up the narrow street
witli the mail bag?, in such a vile temper, by the way. that t h^ Mule had
to hurry after him.
"It is a slow business," said the schoolmaster to Sergeant N'olveda of
the Guardia Civil, who lived in San Celnni and trained one young recruit
n f tor another according to the regulations of this admirable corps. For
one never meets a Guardia civil alone, hut always in company- an old
head and a pair of young leers. "A slow business. He is not a lover such
as I should choose were I a pretty girl like Caterina; but one can nevi r t< i!
with women *h?"
Indeed, matters did not progress very quickly. The Mule appeared to
take so much for granted- to tnke ns sain so much that had not been said.
Even the love-making ee< mcd to him to have be< n understood, and he
appeared to be quite content to go his daily journeys with the knowli dge
that Caterina was to be his wif>. There were, of course, others in the
valley who would have been Kind enough to marry Caterina, but she had
showed no preference for any of these swains, who knew themselves in
ferior, in a worldly sense, to the Mule. So the whole countryside gradually
accustomed itself also to the fact that Caterina was to marry Quereno.
The news even spread to the mountains. The Mule heard of it there one
day when he had accomplished fourteen daily journeys to the accom
paniment of this new happiness.
As he was nearing the summit of tho pass he saw Pedro Casavel, who
had been "in the mountains" three years, seated on a stone awaiting him.
Pedro c a =avel whs a superior man, who had Injured another in a dispute
originating in politics. His adversary was an old man. now stricken with a
mortal disease. And it was said that Pedro Casavel could safely return to
the village, where his father owned a good house and some land. His
enem- had forgiven him. and would not prosecute. But Casavel lingered
in tho mountains, distrusting so Christian a spirit.
He rose as tho Mule slowly approached. He carrfed a gun always, and
was more dariner than his companions in retreat. The Mule meohanlcally
sought in his jacket pocket for a box of match- s. which ho knew would be
a welcome eift. and held them out silently as he neared Casavel. Hut
Ca-avel did not take them.
"I hear that you are to marry Caterina." he said, with a half disdainful
laugh. "Is it t r
"It is true." n:iswered the Mule.
"If you do," cried the other, passionately, with a bang on the stock of
his gun that startle] Cristofero Colon, "if you do I will shoot you "
The Mule smiled slowly, just as he smiled when the people cried "Ai-i
--ieah" as ho passed them.
"1 am gome to marry her." he said, wfth a shake of the head. And
mechanically he handed the othor the box of matches, which Casavo] took
though his eye? still flashed with anger and that terrible jealousy which
flows in southern blood. Then the Mule walked slowly on. while "his dog
shambled after him. turnlnf? back once or twice to glance apprehensively
at the man left standing in the middle of the rocky path. Dogs, it Is
known, have a keener scent than human â perhaps also they have a
keener vision, and see more written on the face of man than we can per
ceive.
The Mule turned at the summit of the pass and looked down, as ho
always did, at tho village where Caterina lived, before turning his fare
to Tho sunnier southern slope. He saw Casavel standing where he had left
him, who hold up tho pun with a threatening gesture. The Mule had no
eye for effect. He did not oven shrug his shoulders.
It was finally the schoolmaster who hurried matters to their natural
conclusion. By his advice, the Mule, who had hitherto lodged In tho house
of the postmaster, rented a mttage of his own and bought some simple
furniture. He consulted Caterina on several points, and sne was moment
arily aroused from a sort of apathy which had come over her of late, by
a very feminine interest in tho kitchen fittings. The best that could be
said for Caterina was that she was resigned. As for tho Mule, like the
animal from which ho had acquired his habits of thought as well as his
name, ho seemed to expect but little from life. So, one morning before
departing on his daily journey, the Mule was unobtrusively married to
Caterina in tho little pink stucco chapel that broods over the village of
San Celoni like a hen over her chickens. And Cristofero Colon and the dog
waited outside.
It was a commonplace ceremony, and at its conclusion the bridegroom
trudged off up the village street behind his mail bags. The Mule, it must
be admitted, was a deadly dull personâ y nnda masâ and nothing more, as
his fond father-in-law observed at the cafe that same morning.
But when he returned on the second evening he made it evident that
he had been thinking of Caterina in his absence, for he gave her, half
shyly and very awkwardly, some presents that he had brought from a
larger village than San Celoni. which he had passed on his way. There
were shops in this village, and it was held in the district that articles
bought there were of superior quality to such as came even from (iranada
or Malaga. The Mule had expended nearly a peseta on a colored kerchief
such as women wear on their heads, and a brooch of blue glass.
"Thank you." said Caterina. taking the presents and examining them
With bright eyes. She stood before him in a girlish attitude, folding the
kerchief across her hand, and holding it so that the light of their new lamp
fell upon it. "it is very pretty."
The Mule had washed his face and hands at the fountain as he came
into San Celoni, remembering that he was a bridegroom. He stood, sleek
and sunburned, looking down at her, and. if he had only had the words,
th. love-making might have commenced then and there, at a point where
the world says it usually ends.
"There was nothing," he said slowly, at length, "in the shops that
seemed to me pretty at all-" He paused and turned away to lay his beret
aside, then with his back toward her he finished the sentence. "Not pretty
enough for you."
Caterina winced, as if he had hurt instead of pleased her. She busied
herself with the preparations for their simple supper, and the Mule ?fit
silently watching her as happy, perhaps, in his dull way, as any King has
ever been. Then suddenly Caterina's tinkers began to falter, and she
placed the plates on the table with a clatter, as if her eyes were blinded.
She hesitated, and with a sort of wail df despair sat down and hid her
f; "' '" '" '" apron. And the Mule's happiness waa only human after all,
for i; was transformed in the twinkling of an eye into abject misery.
!!'â  sat biting his lips, and looking at her as she sobbed. Then at length
â¢ Slowly, and going to her laid his great, solid, heavy hand upon her
shoulder. Bui he could no! think of anything to say. He could only meet
this as he had met other emergencies, with that silence which he had
acquired from the dumb boasts amid the mountains.
At length, after a long pause, he spoke. He had detected a movement,
made by Caterina and instantly restrained, to withdraw from the touch
of his hand, ami this had set his slow brain thinking. He had dealt with
animals more than with men. and was less slow to read a movement than
to understand a word.
'What is It?" he asked. "Ts it that you are sorry you married me?"
Ami Caterina, who belonged to a people saying yea, yea and nay, nay,
nodded her head.
"Why?" asked the Mule, with a deadly economy of words. And she
did no; answer him.
â â ]< it becauseâ there is another man?"
It wns known In the valley that the Mule had never used his knife, not
even In self-defense. Catertna did not dare, however, to answer him. She
only whispered a prayer to the Virgin.
"Is it Pedro Caseval?" asked the Mule, and the question brought her
to her fii i. facing him with white cheek;*.
"No- no- no!" sin cried. "What made you think that? Ohâ no!"
Womanlike, she thought she could fool him. The Mule turned away
from her ami sat down again. Womanlike, she had forgotten her own
danger at the mere thought that Casavel might suffer.
"Anil heâ in the mountains," said the .Mule, thinking aloud. He was
beginning to Bee now. at last, when It was too late, as better men than he
have done before and will continue to do hereafter. Caterina could not
have held out as an objection to her marriage the fact that she loved a
man who was in the mountains. The schoolmaster was not one to listen
To such an argument as that, "specially from a girl who could not know
her own mind. For the schoolmaster was. despite his radical tendencies
bigots in his adherence to the old mistakes.
Caterlna mlpht have told the Mule, perhaps, If he had asked her; for
she knew that he was gentle even with the stubhorn rristofero Colon. But
he had not askod her, failing the necessary courape to faro the truth.
It was, of course, the woman who spoke first, in a quiet voice, with
that philosophy of life which is better understood by women than by men
"You must, at all events, cat." she said, "after your journey.. It Is a
'cocida' that I have made."
She busied herself among the new kitchen utensfls with niovements
hardly yet as certain as the movements of a woman, but rather those of a
child, hasty and yet deft enough. The Mule watched her. sealed clumsily,
with round shoulders, in the attitude of a field laborer indoors. When the
Steaming dish, which smelled of onions, was set upon the table he rose and^-.
dragged his chnlr forward. He did not think of setting a chair in- place
for Caterina, who brought one for herself, and they sat down--ta the wed
ding feast. . â '.',".-'
They appeared to accept the situation, as the poor and the Hard- worked
have to accept the many drawbacks to their lot, without further comment.
The Mule cultivated a more complete silence perhaps than hithertOv. but he
was always kind to Caterina. treating her as he would one 'of his. beast 3
which had been injured, with a mutual silent acceptance of the fact that
she had a sorrow, a weak spot as it were, which must not' be â  tbuchfi'r.
With a stolid tact he never mentioned the mountains, or those' unfortunate
men who dwelt therein. If he met Pedro Casavel he did not mention ths
encounter to Caterina. Neither did he make any reference to Gaterina,':.
when he gave Pedro a box of matches. Indeed, he rarely spoke to. Casavel ';:
at all. but nodded and passed on his way. If Casavel approached, from .
behind he stopped without looking round and waited for him just ai his
mules stopped, and as mules always do when they hear any one approach-
Jns from, behind. . ':
So time wont on. and the schoolmaster, resigning his. situation,' -de- .
parted to Malaga, where, by the way. he came to no good; for of talking
there is too much in this world, and a wise man would not say thank you
for the "gift of the gab." The man whom Pedro Casavel had injured died
quietly in his bed. Caterina went about her daily work wfth her unspoken
history In her eyes, while Pedro himself, no doubt, ate his heart :out in
the mountains. That he ate it out in silence could scarcely .be,- p~>r the â '.'.
tale got about the valley somehow that he and Caterina had been! lovers .
before his misfortune. './â¢"â¢â¢
And as for the Mule, he trudged his dally score of miles, and said
nothing to any man. It would be hard to say whether ho noticed that
Perlro Casave], when he showed himself now in the mountains, appeared
rather ostentatiously without his gunâ harder still to guess whether the.
Mule knew that as he passed across the summit Casavol would sometimes .
lie amid the rocks and cover him with that same gun for a hundred yards
or so, slowly following his movements with the steady barrel so that the
mallcarricr's life hung, as it were, on the touch of a trigger for minutes
together. Pedro Casavel seemed to shift his hiding place as if he were
seeking to perfect certain details of light and range and eleyatinn.' Per
haps it was only a grim enjoyment which he gathered' from thus Holding ;
the Mule's life in his hand for five or six minutes two or three times a
week, perhaps after all he was that base thing, a coward, and lacked thi;jfc>
nerve to pull a triggerâ to throw a bold stake upon "life's taWe.and stand^V
by the result. Each day he crept a little nearer, grew more daring; until
he noticed a movement made by the lank, ill-fed dog, that seemed tn indi
cate that the beast, at all events, knew of his presence in the rocks above
the footuath.
Then one day, when there was no wind, and the light was good and the
range had been ascertained, Pedro ("asavel pulled the trigger. The re
port and a puff of bluish smoke floated up to heaven, where they were
doubtless taken note of, and the Mule fell forward on hi?
" I have it." he muttered, in the curt Andalusian dialect. And then and
there the Mule died.
It happened to hp Cristofcro Colon's day to do the southward journey,
and despite the lank dog's most strenuous efforts, he continued his way,
gravely carrying the dusty mail bngrs to their destination. The dsg re
mained behind with the Mule, pessimistically sniffing at his clothing, -
ognizing no doubt that which, next to an earthquake, is the easiest thing
to recopnize in nature. Then at length he turned homeward, toward San
Celoni, with hanging ears and a loose tail. Me probably suspected that
the Mule had long stood between him and starvationâ that none other
would take his placp or remember to feed a dog of so unattractive an ap
pearance and no pedigree whatever.
Caterina did not expect the Mule to return that evening, 'which -Was-- :

"What is it?" she asked. "An accident to the Mule?" , * â 'â '-'â  /
"Not exactly that," replied the sergeant, grimly, as he made way for

Mule whom they brought in and laid on the table. 'â¢ â¢
"Shot." said the sergeant, curtly. He had, heard the gossip of thÂ«- : val-. :
ley, and doubted whether Caterina would need much pity or consideration "

evidently his captive. Caterina looked up and- met his eyes. It was Pedro
Casavel, sullen, ill-clad, half a barbarian, with the seal of the mountains '
upon him. â  ..
"The mail bags are missing," pursued the sergeant, who in a way was '
the lawgiver of the valley. "Robbery we.s doubt'eÂ«e. the object. We shall

As he spoke he laid his hand upon the Mule's broad chest without

the chance, eh?â on the chance. It was the dog that came and told us.

As the oergeam spoke he mechanically made sure that the Mule's
pockets were empty. Suddenly he stopped and withdrew a folded paper â¢
from the inside pocket of the jacket. He turned toward the lamp to read'
the writing on it. It was the Mule's writing. He was one of the few â¢'
scholars in San Celoni. The sergeant turned, after a moment's thought â 
and faced Casavel again. . . ' . .â¢â â¢â¢'â¢'
"You are free to go, Pedro," he said. "I have made a mistake, dnd'l '

THERE was trouble on Miller &
Lux's ranch the other day.
Henry Miller, "the boss," had
taken it into his head to relieve
a coyote trap and he found out
something he didn't particularly want
to know. The coyote had been caught
fn this trap the night before, but for
some reason nobody had killed it.
Then the old man saw it. He hadn't
had the fun of killing a coyote for a
long time (not since the Legislature
ihe bounty off scalps) so he laid
this one out with professional pride.
When the beast was taken from the

began to swear.
"Who in thunder did that?" he Bhout-

The 'boys slowly came forward and

the quick-footed coyotes came in Fight.
Old Pachugo is one of the best hands

landed in just the right spot.
Mr. Miller jumped off his horse and
turned over the dead animal. Sure

wprse still there were the earmarks.
Miller <t Lux's coyote beyond a doubt.
â  That was done by that Chinaman

"I can tell, because the coyote smells
like rice."
As the Nevada end of the ranch was
over a hundred miles away Mr. Miller
I not make old Pachugo prove his
statement. But he was by no means
convinced, so he made the whole crowd
put in the day on a coyote hunt.

"<;iad I'm not that Chinaman," said
old Pachugo.
"I'll tell you who it was." said Char

"Well, out with it. The Portuguese
didn't do it. I know," said Miller.
"All right," said Charley, "it was that
nigger over on the west side, and he
done it fur your interest."
"My interest? What do you mean?"
yelled Miller, beginning to get mad
again.
"Well, you see," said Charley, "there
ain't no bounty on coyote scalps just
now, so there ain't no use in killing
them. Now the nigger flggered that
he'd brand all the coyotes in the State,

of $2 50 a scalp re-enacted at the next

to kill the varmints except us. And
you can just figger on how much money
we'd have."
Then without a word Mr. Miller got
on his horse and rode off, his head
buried In the deepest kind of thought.
The last words any of the cowboys
hoard him say wore: "Thirty coyotes

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 3, 1899.
END OP TWO OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST FORGERS
The Bidwell Brothers, Who Stole Millions fori) the BanK of
England, Have Just Died Suddenly in a Small Montana Town.
THE sudden deaths last week of
Austin Byron Bidwell and George
Bidwell, in Butte, Mont., removes
two of the gr atest forgers and
criminals of modern times.
The brothers died within a few
days of each other from colds which de
veloped Into pneumonia.
Austin Bidwell, with his brother George,
McDonald and Edward N
formed a quartet of forgers, check rais
ers and ciooks which played upon the
siaH old Bank of England to the tune of
nearly two million dollars.
Through the most unusual efforts put
forth by detectives and police authorities
in cvi ;y part of the world, the tjuartet
were finally captured, and after a sensa
tional trial were sentenced to life impris
onment. George Bidwell secured his re
lease in the early nineties, and Austin was
also released a few years later through
the unceasing efforts of his sister, who ?e
--cured one petition after another, which
she presented to the British Government,
finally obtaining her reward only after
Bldwell had agreed never to place his
foot upon British soil after his release.
He was accompanied by Scotland Yard
detectives to the steamship wharf, and
they never lost sight of him until the
steamer sailed.
Ail England was startled In April, 1878,
when It became known that the Bank of
England, the "Old Woman of Thread
needle street," had been victimized by
American criminals to the amount of $2,

George McDonald was captured In New

the vaqueros had not been In the busi
ness in a wholesale way they had cer
tainly branded enough coyotes to make
the double H mark famous in all the
coyote villages throughout California-
After Miller had gone the vaqueros
admitted that the branding was done
by them "just for fun." Riding the
range and working the round-up oc
casionally needs something to enliven
it. When the bounty was removed from
coyote scalps tho animals increased
rapidly and the horseback riders grad
ually fell into tho habit of putting
spurs to their ponies in chase and
roping the animals. One day one of
them, in a frolicsome mood, clapped
the branding imn on the animal, added
the Miller & Lux earmarks and turned
the coyote loose, "Just to help swell
jhe big herds carrying the same marks
and to start a double H coyote herd."
The men in th? different headquarters
of the big ranch looked on this as a
tremendous piece of ranch humor and
thereafter roping and marking scam
pering coyotes became one of the
standing jokes of the range rider.
Some of the vnqueros became so ex
pert in this line that they began to
take a pride in the character of the
work and in thf> increasing number of
coyotes they add><i to the herd. Grad
ually the 1 most expert of them began
to lasso big hnrfs and soon there wafl
started Â« bran<! of jackr.-ibbits bearing
the double H brand and earmarks.
There are not many hares in the band
yet, but enough to show that the double
H brand has promising running beef
In the jaekrabbit line.
The section "bosses" try their best
to stop these pranks of the vaqucros,
for roping coyotes and Jackrabbits is
apt to be hard on the horses as well as
the time of the playful herdsmen, but
the number of coyotes and hares shot
and trapped show that the happy-go
lucky and prankful vaqueros are car
rying on their sport In spite of watch
fulness.

mined his features. "It ain't the parson,

Donald, the Bidwells and Noyea secured
a building close to the Burlington Gar

Becured large contracts for supplying

basis for several months before starting
to put their scheme Into effect.
They had learned that time bills, when
deposited in a Batik of England branch,
were not sent to the signers to be in
itialed, as Is customary in this country,
so after fully establishing their credit
several good bills at short time were de
posited. Tlkso went through all right,
and then b< veral bills, the amounts of
which by the usp of aclda and clever pen
manship had been raised, were depos
ited. These were at three months time
and wer< â ' : I ted at various times and
in various amounts until the total rep
resented between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000.
As the monej w.is drawn against thfÂ»
bills it was used in the purchase of United
States bonds, and no suspicion was awak

by the bank officials that several of the
bills bore no date. The bills purported
to be signed by the Rothschilds, Barinp
Brothers, Jay Cooke and McCulloch fk
Co., and a messenger was sent to the of

MADE PORTION OF SAN FRANCISCO
IS SLOWLY SETTLING
Surveyors Say the Lowep End of .Market Street Is Going Down at
the Rate of Three Inches a Yeap.
IS the "made" portion of San Fran
cisco subsiding gradually into the
waters of the bay?
This is not the question of a hot
headed, irresponsible alarmist; it i^
a problem which is seriously dis
turbing the minds of ckar-brained
citizens, who do business and own prop
erty in the most crowded and valuable
portion of San Francisco.
An ocular demonstration of the fact can
be gained by any one who will walk down
Market street to the ferry depot. He will
notice a curious irregularity in the side
walk? at the lower end of the thoroughfare.
Sometimes he will have to ascend an in
clined plane and walk along a raised plat
form three feet or more above the, road
way, at other times he will find the side-
walk on a level with the rest of the street.
If it had not been for the many new
buildings recently erected in this part of
the city the change in level might have
passed unnoticed by the layman, though
df course our engineers and surveyors
have known about it all along, and with
delicate Instruments hive carefully kept
track of the subsiding thoroughfare.
Whenever a new building is erected the
sidewalk has to be laid out in accordance
with the authorized city levels, which
have as their base a stone at the corner
of the sugar factory just under Tele
graph Hill. This building is planted firm
on the solid rock, and therefore cannot
Bettle, so that the surveyors can always
rely on the measurements tak^n from this
point. Jf the whole of Market street had
been rebuilt at once this alteration in the
level would not have mattered very much.
But as it is, the new buildings, with their
inconvenient humps of sidewalks, are few
and far between, while the old structures,
many of them flimsy shanties, remain
unaltered, cheerfully settling down with
the roadway into the blue mud of the bay.
"The lower portion of Market street,
near the ferry," said Mr. Tilton, the City
Surveyor, "is settling at the rate of two
or three inches a year. Why, it is only
fifteen y.ars since Market street was
graded up to its proper level, and since
then it has sunk between two and three
feet. Of course the rate of subsidence
variesâ in some places it is greater than
othersâ but this is about the average."
Another practical illustration of the
fact, patent to the most casual observer,
is the new turntable now being put up by
the Market Street Railway Company in
front of the ferry depot. Stand behind
the turntable and you will see how much
higher it is than the foot of Market street.
The ears will have to run up quite an in
clir.e before they can In- spun round and
sent back on their return journey up
town.
Just as there is no lack of practical
demonstration, so there is no lack of ex
pert evidence available. Baron Uhlig,
the chief draughtsman for the Board of
Harbor Commissioners, has made a spe
cial study of the question during his
twenty-three years service with the de
partment. "There is no doubt about the
subsidence," he said; "it has been going
on for a long time, although I think the
rate at which the city is sinking is some
what less than in former years. Market
street is now two feet below the city
cry almost as quickly as the bank officials
and tied. Alarms were sent all over th*
world, with the resttlt that all four were*
captured. Austin B. Bldwell, who was
the ringleader, was captured In Havana
with his wife, whom he had just mar
ried, and was confined in the military
prison th.-re. He succeeded in effecting
his escape by Jumping from a balcony,
but was recaptured in the woods eighteen
miles from Havana two days alter.
There was no extradition law between
England and Spain at the time, find Bid
wen's lawyers fought bitterly against his
extradition, but he was sent to Englanrt
in July and placed on trial with his
brother and McDonald and Noyes. Ills
brother made an impassioned plea to the
court, declaring that Austin had notn
ing to do with the forgeries, and declar
ing that he alone was guilty. The plea
had no effect, however, and all four were
convicted and sentenced to life imprison
ment.
George Bidwell's health gave way under,
confinement, and he was liberated in ]SfR
He bent all his energies to secure the re
lease of his brother, aiding his sister In
every way. Their efforts were finally
successful and Austin returned to this
country a few years ago. He published
a book of his life, and was conspicuous
on the lecture platform for several years.
His health had never been good since his
confinement.
The story of the great forgery is told
in Austin Bidwell's reminiscences as fol
lows :
"Flndlnpr myself In London in 1872 with
a very clever partner and about $'
in our pockets, we resolved to tackle the
Bank of England, believing: that the
lightning ought to strike where the bal
ances are heavy. We figured the matter
out to our satisfaction that the bank was

base. The city base is only four feet
above extreme high water. Therefore the
foot of Market street is only two feet
above the tidal level."
Here is a startling fact. If the subsi
dence continues at the present rate for
another ten or fifteen years it will only
require an extra high /tide to flood the
lqjyer portion of the main -thoroughfare
of the city and to swamp numbers of
wharves? on the water front. The damage
to property would be Incalculable.
One has to go back to the early days of
the city to trace the causes of this re
markable subsidence. In 1849, when the
pioneer argonauts thronged from all
parts of the world to Yerba Buena, the
waters of the bay covered what is now
the principal shipping: and business quar
ter of the city. The water-front line,
roughly speaking, trended inward from
where Folsom street now meets Spear
street. Thence it continued up Folsom to
Beale street and westward in a diagonal
line through.Howard and Mission streets
to the corner of Market and First. Curv
ing slightly inward the shore line crossed
the Intersection' of Pine and Sansome
streets, and followed very nearly the
line of Montgomery street to the cor
ner of Jackson. Here there was a small
lagoon, which carried the water still fur
ther inward, occupying the space on
which the old opera-house was later on
to be erected. The beach, turning almost
â¢at a right angle, now ran seaward again
to the intersection of Broadway and
Front.
Let any one take a pencil and trace
out this route on a map of the city and
he will realize the large area of San
Francisco which stands on made ground.
This little indentation of the bay, now
vanished from sight, was about 3800 feet
wide and extended inward 1700 feet, hav
ing an area of seventeen acres. Every
inch of this space had to be filled up in
order to make the present city, with its
continuous water front, possible. This
would not have mattered so much had
the filling up been done in a systematic
manner, with suitable and properly placed
material.'
In those good old days, however, every
body was too busy and excited rushing
after gold to think about the future of
the city. San Francisco was left to grow
out of the waters of the bay haphazard
fashion, just as she chose. Anything and
everything was dumped into the harbor
to fill It up, and it is even on record that

attack if one had that very rare com
bination outside of the law of capital,
determination and financial knowledge.
I determined to go to the front myself.
Within a few days I not only had an ac
count opened with the bank, but a fairly
good credit cstaHi.-'ic'l, and all this un-
der a fictitious name. Within a few
months I had borrowed nearly $5,000,0(30
from the bank on collateral and printed
my own collateral.
"I left England, believing the world
was mine, and settled down in the West
indies. I settled my scheme in life and
Bi t out to enjoy myself, not in an intem
perate way. i had no fear of the English
police, as I knew the English have an in
itnlinate idea of the ability of their own
police, and I never counted on their em
ploying the American police after their
own had failed to locate me. Unluckily
fer myself. I was mistaken. John Bull
had his back up and determined to have
nr> in his clutches, no matter what it
cost; so after the English police failed to
find me the bank employed the Pinker
tons, with orders to spare no expense.
The rinkertons put twenty of the be?t
men on the case and soon let daylight
into the whole affair.
"In the end I was arrested in my owti
h'.usp, taken to London and faced an
English jury in the famous old Bailey
court, of course, I was perfectly willing
to pay justice her due, and felt that I
had no right to protest, if I should re
ceive a sentence of even ten or fifteen
years, but when the Judge, Lord Archi
bald, hurled a sentence of imprisonment
for life at me 1 felt that justice was
weighing me in her balance with a pret
ty good effect. Now. in England a life
sentence means life with a big L. but I
thought that anything would be possible
if I only had courage to endure. I re
solved I would endure the peltings of the
pitiless storm I knew was ahead of me.
This I did with more or less fortitude for
over twenty years. I never lost my faith
that there was corn and wine in Egypt
for me still."
George Bidwell was caught In France
ami Austin Bidwell in Cuba. They were
tried and given life sentences with their
two confederates. After twenty years
they were released.
in those extravagant .times, when the
market was overstocked, bales and casrs
of valuable goods were used to form side
walk?. The contents speedily rotted and
the packages sank out of sight in the .
mud to take their place in forming the
foundations of a great city.
Many large ships, being unable to find
crews, were monred to the shore anjl
turned into hotels nr busings establish
ments. They, too, When their time came, .
rotted and sank into the mud. Even to
day, when driving, piles for a foundation,,
it is no uncommon thing for the contract
ors to find their progress stopped* by the
timbers of some old ship, buried man/
feet below the surface.
It can easily be understood how this
mass of decomposing material has allow
ed Itself to be compressed by the weights
placed upon It. Then, until the seawall
was built in 1877, there was nothing to
prevent the waves of the bay washing
out the filling, just as they are doing to
day east of Mission, where the protecting:
wall is still lacking. Even as it is, the
seawall does not form an absolutely per
fect barrier. The tide finds its way
through the Interstices of the loosely laid
stones and bears seaward each day a
certain proportion of mud. The concrete
wall erected opposite the new ferry depot
affords a better safeguard against the
action of the waves, and if this were the
only source of trouble would undoubtedly
check the subsidence of Market street.
But we must go still deeper to get at
the root of the evil. It is not merely the
loosely made ground on top which is at
fault. The trouble ' is that this filling,
unsatisfactory though it be, has no better
foundation to rest upon than soft mud.
It is an actual fact that the bedrock
underlying San Francisco Bay has never
been struck. The metamorphic sandstone
which crops out on the side of Telegraph
Hill and rises again on the other side of
the harbor dips sharply under the water.
For countless centuries each rapidly run
ning tide has been bringing down its load
of mud from the upper reaches of the bay
nnd depositing it along the beaches
wherever the contour of the land checked
for a while the rapid rush at jjhe current.
The Terba Buena indentation must have
receiv( d Its full share of this sediment,
soft, blue, greasy stuff, for no man with
certainty knows its depth.
Exports differ on the point. Baron T*h
lig thinks the bedrock may be anywhere
from two to three hundred feet below the
city level. "We cannot say accurately,"
he explains, "for as far as we ha.ye yet
gone down, we have struck nothing but
blue mud, gradually stiffening into blue'
clay. In 1572, when taking a survey for
the proposed seawall, we made a horing
two hundred .feet, but never encountered
rock. In 1890, at another place on the
water front, we went down 150 feet with
the same result."
The contractors, who are always busy
driving piles on the water front, can give,
in spite of all tneir experience, no more
definite Information. "We have nevet
struck bedrock anywhere," said a member
oi one of the largest tlrms engaged in this
business. "The longest piles we have ever
driven have gone to a depth of eighty-five"
feet, but we have never encountered any
thing but mud."
The experience gained in building the
seawall illustrates the unstable character
of the ground. To make this wall it was
necessary to dump huge scowloads of
rock into the bay, and to keep on dump
ing until the stone at last ceased to Set
tle. Often at the end of the day's, work
the contractors would leave the wall
standing several feet out of the water..-
When they returned to labor in the mom- .
ing the loosely piled rock would have
sunk to a depth of twelve or fifteen feet,.
In one instance a strip of the wall about
300 feet in length sunk bodily out of sight,
and the whole work had to be recom
menced. However, patience and an inex
haustible supply of rock triumphed in the
end, the mud was compressed until it
would yield on longer and the seawall
sank to its final bearings.
No man can say when the period of sub
sidence will ceaseâ when the underlying
clay shall have been so firmly compressed
that it will yield no more.
Meanwhile, unless some change happens,
it may become necessary to follow the
example of Chicago, and to bodily raise
this low lying portion of the city to a safe
height above high water mark.
Glowworms are much more brilliant
when a storm Is coming than at other
seasons. Like many other mysteries of
Nature, this curious circumstance haa
never been explained.

"Then, ah, it's all of my life I like
to think about. It wasn't but two n<^xt
years, throe years. My husband got
sick and didn't get any better, and then
he died. I didn't have anything but
just myself, and I had to live, and I
could not live on nothing. No. I had
to have things, so I got a little house:
you know, one with a little window
over the door.

again. I wanted to see my villa sr>\ al

So I went, but I didn't let anybody
know I was there. I went to the plnce
where they put the babies to die.
There was a baby there. A little bit
of a brown baby, and she didn't look
rrruch good anyway. But I wanted
some one from my own village, and so
I took the baby, and she is Ah Lung.

so I say she shall never be like the

It's bad, yes, and only the girls who
want to be good and the dear Jt>sus
knows about that. You see she is a

can she do?

Horn Get go. Then Loo Oheo went to
the Kwai Kung tong and made a big
complaint about me.
"Fong San came and he said I must
give Horn Get to Loo Chee or he would
make me trouble. After all the money
I have paid Fong San. No! Oh. I have
given him plenty money to protect me!
Well, he knew Horn Get belonged to
me because I only said I would send
her to her father if he would keen her
and get her married. When he sold
her that broke the bargain.
"Well, that was tuo months ago.
Last week Fong Sing came to see me.
He told us Loo Wing was dead. So
now Horn Get has no home and she
must stay here and I'll get her married.
I won't let her marry any but a Chris
tian man. The blue ribbon she wears?
Oh, that's to show she has some one
dead. What you call mourning."
While Suey Hin was telling about
Horn Get two of the girls brought us
tiny cups of tea and confections of
Sried cocoanut. A little three-year-old
girl in a red sam and yellow trousers
put -a doll in my lap. It was dressed
in Chinese style, most magnificently.
"Lunt gave me," she said, in Eng
lish.
"You a boy and like dolls?"
"I not boy, I girl; I Ah San." I looked
inquiringly at Suey Hin, for the child
wore thi* dresa of a boy.
"Oh, yes, she's a girl. I dre?s her like
a b,oy so the mission people will not
steal her. I very cute! They see I
bring her up for a slave girl and then
they come and rescue her. Oh, no, no,
not at all! I make her look like a boy."
"Where did you get her?"
"Bought her. Hought her when she
was ten days old. She's smart. Ah
San, come here. Oh, she understands
everything! Now, Ah San, sing 'Jesus
Love? Bte. 1 "
The little one repeated the sentence
and then she said the whole of "The
Lord. is My Shepherd," and all in very
good English.
"What will you do with her?"
Suey's face saddened. You could see
she was very fond of the child. "I don't
know; maybe give her to the mission.
Do you want to go to the mission, Ah
San?"
The little face clouded and the tears
began to run over the black eyelashes.
Suey gathered the little one up in
her arms. Ah San's were not the only
wet eyes as she said: "I good, I good
girl, Suey."
"What will you do with the other
girls?" I asked.
"Oh, I suppose they get married. Only
they must marry Christians. I Chris
Receptacle for Gast-Off Qirl-Babies Near SWatoW, GKirva.
From a Photograph.
As most people know, th 6 birth of a girl child into a Chinese home is
not a welcome event. She is a "go-away child"â that is to say, when mar
ried, she leaves her home and goes to her husband's, whereas a son brings
home his wife with him. "When a Chinese father is reckoning up the num
ber of his household he counts only his sons. The birth of a girl means
simply another mouth to fill; and for this sordid consideration baby fdrls are
oft< D not allowed t" live, when they are not actually made away with,
they are disposed of by some such indirect means as that shown In the ac
companying photo. Here we see a basket fastened to the wall of the city
of Chaochao-foo, some thirty miles up river from the treaty port of Swa
t'i\v. This basket is for the reception of newly born girls who have not
found a welcome in their own homes-a veritable "letter box." where baby
girls aro "posted!" The father may possibly be troubled with some slight
scruples about actually killing the infant, so he placos it in this strange re
ceptacle, whence any one wishing to adopt a female child is at liberty to
remove it and do what he likes with it. U is awful practices like this "that

HELEN GREY.
VERNACULfIR OF CRIMINALS.
CRIMINOLOGY has its own langauff*
--terse., expressive and incompre
hensible to the uninitiated. It is
necessarily a growing as well as a
shifting, changing langauge. to
â¢which the young, active and ingeni
ous criminals are constantly contributing:,
whl.le a few expressions are dropped from
time to time by common consent or give
place to new and more forceful ones. . :
A few of the words and phrases have
proven so apt that they have found their
way lntÂ» higher society, and are used
side by side with those of more reputable
â¢ origin.
Some slang words are in general use
among rogues, but in addition each coun
try and each city has Its peculiar dialect, \.
New York naturally having the richest
and most complete lexicon of this sort in
America.
A detective is referred to as an elbow
" and .1 policeman as a "finger" or "flatty."
The crook is a "gun" or a "mug," an old
timer comes up at repeated and regu
lar intervals -being referred to as a "re
volver." The fellow who knows even.- de
tective by sight and can tip him off to his
comrades is termed a "lighthouse." The
leader of a gang is their "main guy,
their place Â«>f meeting the "joint and the.
gang itself is the "push." ' .
The plunder which results from a rob
bery is referred to in general as "the
bundle." A gold watch is a "yellow one
and a silver watch is a "white one." A
pocketbook is a "leather" and a diamona
is a "spark." â¢ .
"Graft" is a rogue's line of business,
and a pickpocket is a "grafter" or a
"dip," while the shoplifter is spoken of as
a "noister" (pronounced "hyster"). The
"dip's" companion, who bumps up against
the victim, or otherwise attracts his at-,
tention while his pal robs him is known
as a "stall," When a man is said to be
"flagged" it means that he is permitted
to go unmolosted. Bonds are "paper,"
counterfeit money is "the queer," and the
man who passes "the queer" is "a
shover." A forger is known among
criminals as a "scratcher." Jewelry
thieves are "penny-weighterSj" flat or
house thieves are "sneaks." A hank thief
Is a "bank sneak." and a safe thief is a
"Peter." Knockout or chloral drops are
also "Peters." Victims of the rogues are
called "suckers," unless they "squeal,"
â when they are termed "beefers." One
who has newly come into the fraternity is
said to have "just broken out." and a re
formed man has "squared it."
A woman who works with thieves is a
"molly," and a man who steals from a
â woman is a "moll-buzzer." A man who
â¢works the churches trying to steal from
those in attendance is spoken of in this
way.
There are "cross-roaders," who make a
special business of following the President
on his tours about the country and at
tending conventions and other crowded
occasions. Gold brick men are also
spoken of as "cross-roaders."
A "squealer" is the one who gives the
gang away; a "fence" is the receiver of
stolen goods: a "scrapper" is a victim
â¢who offers resistance to his attackers, and
a "crib" Is a saloon or gambling place.
A man is sent to the "jug" when he goes
to the county prison or jail, but State
prison is the "stur," and his term is ex
pressively referred to as so many
"stretches" in place of years.
When a prisoner is convicted he is said
to be settled; if released, he is turned out.
Dividing the spoils is known as "whack-
Ing up. Warning signals are given by
a peculiar throaty hacking.
A watch and chain are often referred to
as a "super and slang." and when a thief
announces that he "pinched a guy's yel
low super on the green-light rattler." it
may be translated into the statement that
he stole a man's gold watch on a Four
teenth-street car.
"The guy tumbled and we done a lamb"
Blgnlfles that the intended victim was onto
the game and the thief ran away.
"He screwed his nut" means that he
turned his head so that he- could not see
anything. "The guy was made up" '.a
easily understood to mean that he- was
disguised.
"Are your eyes tired?" asks a Colum
bus avenue optician by means of a sign
In his window. "Try a massage, '25
cents." The operation takes ten minutes;
and is very soothing. The optician places
you in a chair and quickly manipulates
the eyelids with his forefingers and
thumbs, rubbing them first toward the
nose and then back toward the ears. He
says that it prevents the circulation, of
blood across the eyes and clears away
the tiny, flitting spots that sometime* .
bother people who read a grreat deal.26

Women are not financiers because, for
hundreds of years, they were dependent
and untaught as to the value of money
and the means of making it. The cum
ulative fads and follies, the perversions
of right and wrong of ages past, are ac
countable for their indifference to sub
stantial food, their habitual neglect of
that which ie needful to build up sound
constitutions and to insure length of use

tury that makes physical culture a part
of practical piety, and analyzes solemnly
the influence of digestive idiosyncracies
upon spiritual, mnrai and mental growth,
do not counterbalance the fatal weight
of heredity in this vital matter. Where
\oman. conscious of the dignity of
member and organ of her body,

intelligent relish of well-chosen, well

of the pleasures of the table, and fifty
more will apologize for seeming enjoy

A FAMOUS DELLA ROBBIE
BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY
THE careful preparations for the
worthy exhibition of Mr. A. Au
gustus Healy's latest grift to the
Brooklyn Institute Museum are
finally completed. Experts and
critics, as well as the general pub
lic, are rtow invited to examine an
important masterpiece of Italian art. Va
rious announcements have been made at
different times as to the fact of the gift
of a Delia Robbia relief, but no exami
nation of the work itself, and conse-
Giovanni della Robbia Relief of the Resurrection,
Presented to the Brooklyn Ins titute by Mr. A. Augustus Healy.
quently no proper appreciation of its
value, has been possible till now.
During Mr. Healy's customary annual
visit to Florence last summer he -was ad
vised of the possibility of purchasing a
relief by Giovanni De.la Rbbbis at the
.Villa Antinori, near that city. Since thÂ«
|527 thin relief had been in the pos
n of the Antinori family, for whom
y made in That year as
one of the rs of their villa. The
tase was successfully achieved and
the greater difficulty was also overcome
of procuring the consent of the Italian
Government to the shipment away from
Italy.
The relief, which is of enameled terra
cotta and in dimensions â  feet
by three feet high, represents the
Resurrection. It was origins
above one of the entrance doors of the
and corresponds in shape to the
-circular pediment whose space it
once filled. The name of "luner.
the minist- always gave me the signal when he was ready for The music,
and I in turn Jnformed the organist. The church door constantly opened
and closed "with a cautiousness that a burglar would do well to imitate,
and one after another of the women with dismal faces noiselessly passed
up tne aisle with such dejected mien that only a friend or relative cuuld
eel. Eventually the woman with the peculiar facial gymnastics appeared
at the door. The moment 1 saw her I could scarcely resist the desire to
laupn. She prowled slowly along: with the most woe-begone expression
until she reached the casket, and then she stopped, while her face assumed
geometrical figures -with the drooping funereal aspect. She first stood at
the foot and then at the head ot the casket, looked at this angle of vision
and then at that,- until she had surveyed the departed from the seven
points o. the compass.. Between observations she would heave a sigh and
elongate her features to a surprising degree. Then in a twinkling this
nervousness seized herâ the forlorn expression .disappeared. The muscular
contraction of the lower jaw began its work, and though she still continued
ncr jnspection . of the corpse she made faces of the most side-splitting
"The minister signaled for the music, the organ played the prelude
and the choir managed to ejaculate -O, 1 and then we all sat down con
vulsed with laughter. â¢It was simply uncontrollable. The m niÂ«ter was
perplexed at the delay and signaled again, which only increased our
hilarity.. It was exceedingly painful for a while, but we soon mastered rmr
unruly spirits and satisfied the astonished minister with the mu"ic At
any rate, this was the most conspicucus Easter service if not the most
praiseworthy memory." â¢" BI

The wedding of Mips M. C. Ranktn and

M?mh 30. ut the residence of Mr. and

'â¢ia.tions were very elaborate, consisting
of ferns, palms. smilax and evergreens.
Cornelius Waterman and Anna Druse
commonly applied to such a curvilinear
pediment space and is consequently ap
plied to the relief itself.
The artist, Giovanni Delia Robbla. was
a member of the famous family to which
the manufacture of such enameled terra
cotta reliefs was almost â wholly confined,
and of their work as a whole it Will be
well to say a word or two. That their art
is now a lost one is better Hnown to the
expert than it is to the general public.
This is, of course, one of the reasons for
prizing the gift of Mr. Healy. No similar
reliefs have been made since the sixteenth
century, and the artist of this Resurrec
tion was the last to practice this work
in perfection.
The Robbia reliefs are thus not only
unique in their material but also in their
period and style. Finally, the number of
important examples of this art which
have found their way to Northern Europe
is quite limited, and in Italy itself they
are wholly confined to the territory of
Tuscany. In the United States there is
"ne other important Robbia reliefâ
the one which was presented to the M-:
--ropolitan Museum some years ago by H.
G. Marquand. and which cost >
The Brooklyn relief shows the following
colors: White, blue, green, yellow and
liÂ£ht and dark brown. This relief is in
fact wholly pictorial in quality and is a
translation into colored terra cotta of the
traditional Italian subject of the Resur
rection.

TAKEN IN THEIR EASTER HATS
Continued From Page Twenty-four.
THE beautiful Easter hats on page 24 not only show oft. the
charming: faces of their wearers to advantage, but they like
wise settle a much discussed question. How do the creatio-ns
of our local milliners compare with those that are wrought
by the clever lingers of Paris and New York milliners?
The hats worn by Nance O'Neil, Gladys Wallis and Sadie Marticot
are from three milliners who have added to the reputation of New
York or Paris. â  .
The rest of the hats were made by well-known San Francisco
milliners. â¢
The hat worn by Challa, the Cuban song bird, was ma 3Â« by
"Ray Fromberg."
â¢Lucille's" deft fingers fashioned the odd hat that heightens Helen
Bertrams beauty.
Was anything ever more becoming to fascinating Jessie BaxtTett
Davis than the artistic comoination of straw, chiffon and flowers ar
ranged by "Turner"'? Her sister's hat. not less becoming, is from the
City of Paris, and the remaining three are from Keith's.
Now isn't this optical and conclusive proof that our clever mil
liners are not put to blush by any who wield the needle and thread,
the wide world round?

army to marry a woman who appeared in a public profession. Hert
Tauscher was a German officer, and we kept this secret for two yearsâ â -''.

QT'ERITA VINCENT, who is .gain
ing such great popularity at the
Olympia. has a veny pretty story
connected with her first work out
side her own.- country. Her parents
are Central Americans, her fatnei
being now in Chile. Querita. however,
was born and went to school here in San
Francisco. She went with her parents to
visit her father's people in Chile. She
was dancing in th" town at the time the
sailors from rhe Vnited States ship Balti
came to blows with the Chileans
while the former were going through the
town at night. , ,
Tin Wood of the Chileans boiled, and
they were ready to swim in American
gore. The sailors were forbidden to. leave
the vessel, and the news of the insult was
wired all over the world. For a while It
looked as if there might be trouble.
Querita was an American, but a Chilean
too, and after she had danced her audi
ence into sympathy one night she refused
to dance after repeated reauesta for an
encore. But the audience would not ba
refused and applauded so much that the
programme could not be continued. That
Qulreta Vincerjt.
was what the girl -wanted, and she had
prepared for it. Draping the American
and the Chilean flags about herself sha
went on to the stage and began her most
seductive dance. . â  '
The people sprang to their feet ana
hissed and hooted. The manager came
to see what the ro.w was about and dis
covered the dancing girl's drapery.
But Querita would not stop. She
danced on till she was out of breath. One
and another began to cheer her, and be
fore she finished she had won back a
good portion of her andience.
Two days later she received a messasa
from the* commander of the Baltimore,
asking-her to repeat her dance before the
sailors. She accepted the Invitation and
danced on board with the two flags.
After a most delightful afternoon she
was rowed back to land by the admiring
sailors. Soon the Baltimore sailed away,
and the international incident was settled
without blood flowing in the rivers, which,
the Chileans had felt was their only vin
dication. Querita came back to the
United States and her dance was only one
of her past triumphs. . â¢'
One day she received a parcel, and when
she opened it she found a beautiful tiara
of rhinestones set in filigree .gold work,
and also two small silken - flags, one an
American and one a Chilean', j It was
from the sailors of the Baltimore, .who

ing the sailor hat in the background.
This indicates that the snilor will be very
popular early in the warm season. Like
â the shirt waist the sailor hat is neat, con
venient and becoming. Therefore the
sailor hat remains, having taken on since
the last season of Its glory several beauti
fying touches.
The brims and crowns are of medium
width and height and the braids of which
they are made are very fine and beautiful.
Whites, blues and blacks arc the most
stylish. Browns and both light and dark
shades of tan and show promise of
beinp well liked.
Probably because it is somewhat of a
novelty the sailor hat that slopes down
slightly toward the front is particularly
favored.
There are many mixed straws, but the
color is but a line tracing through the

must go out in all kinds of weather, she
must struggle through a daily routine
in some office or downtown place of busi
ness, returning home at night, frequent
ly after a soul-wearying, nerve-exhaust

there is mending to be done, the dii n< r
waiting to be cooked, perhaps, and a
thousand ami one little duties that must
be performed. She finailj drops Into her
bed so thoroughly exhausted that she
vaguely hopes never to see the dawning
white. I fancy the plain whites and those
of solid color will be most worn, and they
are really the prettiest, for the trimming
shows up on them in effective contrast.
Bright bands and bowa are used on
plain hats. A soft shade of red is
especially liked. A royal blue band and
rosette looks smart on a fine Panama.
I M you remember the seasons when
there was a perfect craze for the rough-
and-ready straws? Well, if you remem
ber those seasons you will recall that the
rough braids looked amazingly pretty
with gauzy trimming and bright flowers.
Well, the effect is about the same In
many of the most attractive springtime

fancy Neapolitan straws are stunning in

so is soap.
Let your first investment be in a large
bar of pure, imported castile soap. You
will lind it much less expensive bought
that way. Cut it yourself into small
cakes and put it away on a high shelf.
where it will become dry and hard. Soap.
Jike wine, improves with age. and the
harder it is the better the quality. The
soap, together with plenty of warm wa
ter and some good washrags, will make
up a beauty outfit that will outclass all
the rouges, eyebrow pencils and
meties in general that were ever put into
the windows of beauty shops to tempt
women's souls.
Next comes the daily bath. Tills is

omitted for a single day, for the secre
tions of the skin and the dust gatnered
during the day must be removed it the
skin is tn be kept in a perfect condition.
Tl;e complexion is sure to suffer when
ttv body is not kept scrupulously clean,
and eruptions and blackheads are the
natural consequent ,
Now, don'l say you have not the time
for this daily sponge bath, for it can be
got through with in almost no time,
and it will make the blood tingle and the
flesh glow as nothing else can.
The hands frequently Become chapped
and rough and will not stand soap. When
this is the case prepare a little almond
meal. If you do not care to go to the
expense of purchasing the meal you can
get the pn ssed almond cake, which is
nearly as good and much cheaper, and
for the orris root substitute wheat flour,
"fake three ounces of the former and
seven ounces of the letter. A little ial
cum :>owder added will improve it if
you feel you can afford It.
A very excellent cream for the face and
hands is benzoinated mutton tallow. This
is made by taking one-half pound of mut
ton tallow, which, of course, every one
knows how to make, and one-half ounce
of benzoin and keeping both ingredients
Â«t a steady heat until the alcohol of the
benzoin has completely evaporated. Then
strain through muslin.
About the hair? What is the secret of
luxuriant tresses? Again the answer is,
absolute cleanliness. To obtain this the
hair must be brushed each day and after
a shnmpoo must be thoroughly rinsed in
running water. If the hair is at all sticky
after washing or If a white substance ad
heres to the comb, then the hair is not
clean.
Castile soap makes the best shnmpoo in
the world. Dissolve a small piece in hot
water, and if the hair is at all oily add
a tiny bit of ammonia or alcohol. If the
hair falls or is in need of a tonic, sage
tea is as inexpensive as anything you can
find although it should not be used on
light hair, as it has a slight darkening
tendency. Common kerosene is an unsur
passed remedy for falling hair, only when
using it one needs to put a clothes pin
on one's nose. A little of it rubbed into
the scalp each night with the finger tips
is an inexpensive way of stimulating the
scalp and will make the hair grow long
and nice and fine. Combs and brushes
must be kept scrupulously clean.
Diet also prays a leading part in the
beauty getting efforts, for it has a most
decided effect upon the complexion. Sim
ple food, as varied as possible, but cooked
to just the proper turn, is what Is needed
for' both health and good looks. Most of

vegetables and fruit. Fat very little pas

shun Icecream soda as you would your

Answers to Correspondents.
DOROTHYâ Here is the formula for
orange flower skin food: Spermaceti.
one-half ounce; refined white wax, one
half ounce: sweet almond oil, one ounce;
lanoline. one ounce; cocoanut oil. one
ounce; tincture of benzoin, ten drops;
orange flower wat -r, one ounce. Molt the
first live ingredienis in a porcelain kettle.
Take from the fire and add the benzoin
and orange flower water, beating with an
egg-beater until cold.
HOPEâ I know nothing of the cold
cream you mention. As the lotion that
you have been using does not seem to
agree with your skin I should discontinue
it If you will follow some of the direc
tions given in the Beauty Talk last Sunday
I am sure the condition of your nose will
be benefited. I think it is the circulation
that is at. fault In your ease. Send me a
stamped addressed envelope and I will
send you the name of a prepared liquid
powder that is better than aything I
have formula for.
B B b.â The lemon hair wash will
bring out the reddish tints of your hair.
In a quart and a half of warm water dis
solve one ounce of salts of tartar and add
the Juice of three lemons. Use as a
shampoo, rinsing the hair thoroughly In
clear water. This will not injure thÂ»*
hair. When a child Is very young the
length and luxuriance of the eyelashes
may be increased by careful clipping of
the'points, every month or six weeks. This
should be done with a tiny pair of mani
curing scissors. But really this operation
requires such great precaution in order
to avoid hurting the child or injuring the
eye that f- hesitate to advise It. The
slightest movement on the part of the
child might result in its losing' its eye
sight, which is much more important than
the i<ngth of its eyelashes, isn't it? .
DIANAâ For the eyebrows I would ad
vise you to get one ounce of alcohol and
in it dissolve live grains of quinine. Apply
this every other night, and" on the nights
in between limes massage very gently
with the lingers dipped in pure olive oil,
slightly warmed. Yes, olive oil used on
the face is very likely to promote the
'.-i< wtn of hair.
MOTHERâ An iron tonic taken when the
hair first begins to turn gray will some
times arrest its progress. If the hiir Is
dark rubbing a little claret into the roots
will also assist. I know of nothing else
I, in a dye, and this you say you do not
wish, nor would 1 advise. To reduce your
weight avoid fattening and farinaceous
foods, drink lemonade and mineral
waters, shun sweets, don't sleep too many
hours and exercise to the utmost fullest
limit. Trousseau, a celebrated French
physician, advised two grams of bi
carbonati of soda at eacli meal. There
are three excellent rules for the preven
tion of wrinkles. They are:
Don't worry.
Don't fret.
Don't cross bridgi s.
Massage with a good skin food is also
helpful. No, it doesn't stretch the skin
:â¢ properly done. However, if improperly
done it will certainly do more harm â 
than pood.. It should never be done with
out first smearing the face with a good
cold cream or skin food. Thank you tor
your kindly thoughts of me.

AGGRKSSIVE P.â Please read forego
ing replies to Mother and Ardent Admirer
fur answers to your first two questions.
It is exceedingly difficult to describe the
movements lor facial massage, but I will
do my best. First of all. after the face
has been thoroughly cleansed, cover it
thoroughly with the orange flower skin
food. Rub always upward and ontward,
using a rotary movement. Take the
nose as a central point, rubbing always
away from this feature. For the wrinkles
in the forehead, place the thumbs on the
temples and the first lingers at the top
of the forehead. Hold the skin tight in
this way and with the second and third
lingers rub up and down across the lines.
For tin- little lines about the eyes, hold
the flesh with th- fingers of one hand
while you rub with the oiher, using a cir
cular upward and outward .motion. Thi3
is as near as [ can explain in writing.
There is nothing better than orange fiC-Wr
er skin food for beautifying purposes.
T\M O'SHANTBRâ Suppose you try
lemon iuiee on that red skin. Tf you find
that the pure juice irritates the skin di
lute it one-third with rosewatef. Before
it has quite dried on the skin apply a.
pure cold cream. If this does not help
yon. write to me again.

they used the prepared cream you men

rosewater three-fourths ounce: powder
ed borax, twenty grains; essence or
doves, flvi drops. If your skin is ver>
dry. omit the borax.

Now, It was not the time for a man to be
sleeping; neither ought I to have remained on
the roof, at such an hour, since It Ib' then that
the women of the harem come forth to take
the air and to hold their drawing room: nor
does any one of the other sex venture to show
himself then in that way.
However, all the ' women must have gone
down, save only this maiden, whose eyes were
fixed on me with an intense curiosity. An 1
I in turn gazed at her; whereupon, coming yet
closer, with a sudden, motion she put aside her
veil, and I saw an Eastern face, beautiful
enough to satisfy the descriptions In their
luxuriant verse.
The clear forehead, with dark lashes over
large and still darker eyes, the eyebrows al
most joined, the complexion a warm brown
tint, the teeth like shining coral, and the lips
eloquent with some beseeching motion that
made them tremble slightly. Her attire was
magnificent-a tunic of embroidered satin,
fringed with golden wire, and jeweled slip-
-rs. -
In her hand she appeared to be holding a
kerchief and while I continued In an attitude
of deep' surprise she rolled it up into a ball
and flung it dexterously across. I stooped and
took up the handkerchief, which was wrought
of purple silk and seed pearls, and therein I
found a tiny scrap torn from the beginning of
some poem, which had on it. written in Ara
bic, the word "to-morrow." When I lifted my
eves a second time the damsel had vanished.
'Now, I was not Ignorant of the circumstance
that this house adjoining ours was the chief
dwelling of a personage with whom to meddle
would have been the extreme folly. It belonged
to All Bey's son-in-law, who was likewise the
Grand Vizier, the impetuous, daring and un
scrupulous Abu Dahab. He had not returned
from the camp at Al Cairo, but any day might
be expected. This, I felt certain, was one of
h!s wives or his slavesâ most probably a slave,
although she might even be some proud beauty
of the harem.
To-morrow came, and I hestiated whether I
should ascend to the roof. Did not my duty
as an Embassador forbid me to sacrifice the
interest of Karlm Zend, , whose prosperity
might hang upon this alliance? Neither was I
the youth that could not. draw back when Zu
leika beckoned. I must leave the fnir unknown
to the tender mercies of Abu Dahab. let the
thought did not occur to me of quitting Al
That day passed without event. But hardly
had the third morning dawned when I heard
the voice of a black slave in the vestibule..de
manding an audience of Harji Hussein Bey.
It was not an unusual hour, and I admitted
him. â â ^â i;-.. -'â â "
I was requested to hold an Interview with
the First Lady of Abu Dahab' s harem the
Princess, the daughter of All H>-y: and Masud
waÂ« willing to lead vn* into the palace. But,
I stammered, "surely it was not the First
Lady whom?" and there I broke down. Masud
smlfed even so little, and answered:.
"The First Lady thou hast not seen, nor
wilt see That pearl of the morning in whose
beams thou wert illumined was another; and
It is on her account the Princess will have thee
to come No risk in obeying. If thou refuse
for more than one death lies in ambush.
Then little by little the story came out. The
clrl who had raised her veil and thrown the
icraii of verse was called Ilsamln. or Jasmin,
and was a Christian slave. Abu Dahab had
bought her six months before in Alexandria
and Fent her to this house. Her music and
-int-ing were' of the finest : she read admlrablv
knd rfndinu: with intelligence Is a much prized
ar'-orr.rlis=hnient mong Easternsâ while her ex
traordinary-loveliness captivated the heart of
the Vizier. But she would not look at him.

KNIGHTS OF HONOR.
On Monday night Yerba Buena Lodge
initiated its two hundredth member, and
Deputy Lawrence was permitted to do
the work. At the conclusion thereof tho
deputy was by the court. In commemora
tion of the event, presented a handsome
emblematic badge.
Leland Stanford Lodge received a visit
from American Eagle and Union lodges,
and after the business of the evening was
over the doors were opened to. a large
number of strangers, who were admitted
and were treated to a programme of
pleasing entertainment. Past Grand Dic
tator Barnes delivered the address of the
evening.
San Francisco Lodge was visited by
Polar Star and Fidelity lodges. There
was a good attendance. Grand Dictator
Archibald and T. Learned. P. A. D., de
livered interesting and enthusiastic talks.
Then followed a programme of music and
i eong and the serving of a collation.
tenlng to add, "thou, lady, hast no such
disease."
"I have hone, Allah bÂ« praised." she -said.
"It is my slave." with a strong emphasis on
the word. "My slnve Ilsamln that Is afflicted."
"Tel! me the symptoms of her trouble. If it
pleases thee to do so, lady?"
"Know, then, that this Ilsamln Is infatuated
since h.>r arrival In the Golden City. For she
hath fallen In love with one, a Frank even as
thou art; that is to say, not having the blue
eyes nor the corpse-like whiteness of visage, â 
nor the red and 'scanty beard of thy country
men, but"â and here I could observe the eyes
taking my measure â "a dark-haired, dark
whiskered Franjl, whose color is between
bronze and brown, his forehead Bomewhat sal
low, his eyes like unto wells of water in the
desert, and himself slender as a willow tree."
This I knew was nart caricature and part
compliment, but on hearing a rustle behind the
curtain it struck me that Jasmin was in at
tendance. 1 replied, "If such be the Frank, he
is fven as a son of the East. Let thy slave
be given to him."
\ -idden cry of Joy Interrupted me, but the
Princess would herself be heard. "Peace." Bhe
said; "how can I make a present to this Frank
of my lord's servant? For she has found faVor
In the sight of Abu Pahab. This Christian hath
dared to tell her owner that he must marry
her; yen, and divorce his wives, or she will not
.â¢ast an eye upon him. Heardest thou ever
BUi h confidence in a bought slave?"
A girl's voice broke in with tears and pro
tests. "Oh. my lady', never did I dream of
.-'. treason so black. I only desire of Abu Dahab
that he would send me to my father, the
Maionite, and take ransom for me."
"Thou art a fool, Jasmin," said her mis
tress: "many another girl has risen from the
s.-lline-block to the royal seat. Truly, were I
like the Sultana Zubelda I had cut thee in four
quarters and served up the banquet to Abu
Dahah. Wilt thou have- him divorce me, psetty
one?" "Nay." saith she, and the pearls /ell
from her brimming eyes. I could hear the dam
f< I sobbing; this mixture of comedy and trag
edy overcame her. as well it might, for none
can tell how suddenly the eastern sky will
change from sunshine to scathing storm.
"I will take the maiden." said I, " and. de
liver into the hand of this Frank one who Is
so loyal to him."
She seÂ«med to be reflecting. "I know not,"
was her next observation. '"Were it not better
to ask of the physician some white powder that
I could give the damsel? How shall, she be
taken secretly from the harem?"'
I turned to Masud. "Speak now and tell thy
device; it is the hour." It was a very Inge
nious olan and the Princess gave a sort of
. acqulepenee. She was clearly wavering be
twt-pn fear of what might happen if wo failed
and a true, though not deep, kindness toward
Ilsamln. At last she exclaimed, "In the name
of God," thereby signifying her consent, and in
the same instant I saw one breadth of the cur
tain roll on its golden hinges and a young girl
stepped forth alone. Yes. it proved the same
gorgeous dress and the same swci't faoc- which
I had scanned two days previouslyâ again the
veil was put back and Ilsamln fell at my feet.
I raised her up. "My lord, my master," she
murmured, "be good to me. Thou art the first
ânot friend," she said hastily, with a tender
glance t>ward Masud. "Ah. no. for this youth
Is a true friend to meâ but thou art my de
liverer, and how long I have waited for thee'.
Often did I look throuch the lattices and con
sider thee In thy riding past."
"I have many names, my child," Baid I, "but
let me hear thy story."
"My story is soon told. I am the daughter
of a Maronite chiefâ Maronlte, Frank
knowectâ all as one. Aby Marya. on the way
fr> in Palmyra to Damascus, there we abode.
Hast thou seen the place?" I said yes, with a
motion of the hand. "Time was passing like
the wind. From my home I was stolen by
Bedawin at 9 years of age. carried to Smyrna,
sold there and yet once more carried over sea,
Kpld in the market at Kalrouanâ to a' good
master, though a Moslem.
"He taught meâ how many things? Then
ne diedâ God be merciful to Mahmud Effend!'.
And again I was on the market. Abu Pahab
pave a heap of gold for this body which he
coveted, but which I will fling into the live
flame ere he shall touch me. Then Masud took
pity on my wretchedness; Al Cairo, one who
had made the pilgrimage to Mecca, but a
Frank, who lived single and with a blameless
reputation, unlike the Persians that we see.
And It was thru, oh friend."
"Walt, llsamin." sal.l I. "another three
days; It !Â« not long. Masud shall see thee over
the first stage: I will answer for the rest."
Hut even then I was on the point of perish
ing. A sound of arms and music in the outer
court announced some arrival. Jasmin fled be
hind the curtain with one appealing look, and
Masud dragged me hastily alone through a
labyrinth of cross pass&gee, from the barred
windows In which I saw All Bey with a
numerous staff at the gate of the palace.
Surely I was doomed. But In a Calrene
house there are secrets known to the slaves
which the master would be long in die
ing. When we had reached a storeroom I
found myself stepping on a square of carppt
that he plucked Immediately from under my
feet.
A second movement of the energetic Xublan
was to pull up a piece of the flooring, which
this carpet concealed, and I Raw below me
the dark waters of a canal. In another mo
ment I was hanging to a rope which he let
down cautiously some eighteen or twenty feet.
The descent was not- without peril, but when
I had effected it In safety- my feet touched a
narrow iedge of stones like the coping of an
arch, and still with a hand on the rone I
guided myself gradually out of this difficult
place Into a winding and deserted lane. No
*ooner had I reached It than, on looking back,
I saw the cord drawn and the aperture closed.
I reached home and set about my prepara

>.',i!isur. a vile slave, delivered the poor
young srirl into his hands, telling him that she
was henceforth hi? klti-hen maid.
This Mansur had charge of a country house
on the edge of the Nile, and he was to convey
Jasmin thithor on the night of this very day
when Masud came to me. If nothing could be
done torments. and worse than torments,
awaited the <^hlld.
The time .gave us about fourteen hours. I
had several â of - Karlm' most trusty followers,
who would go into the fire had I bidden them;
and being looker! upon by the Cairenes as
Phlahs or heretics there was little fear of
communication between th<- two parttes. I
sent them -with instructions toward the old
Al Cairo, where the country house was situ
ated.
All day long Jasmin sat apart, voiceless. In
mute expectation. The night drew on; we had
planted our scouts, and with a small com
pany I sallied out. .V^-'
We waited in a thicket down by the hank,
our horses picketed near enough to enable U3
to take refuge In flight or to carry away our
prize Immediately. . '-t â â â ''-'-' "*â 
Ilsamln had been warned by Mastid, and she
was to wear the : red handkerchief sh<? had
thrown to me. At length we heard the splash
ing of oars and saw a boat coming up stream
nt a rapid rate, the decks not overmanned.
While two figures standing at stem and stern
held aloft flaming cressets. ";.'â '
â¢ As the boat, grounded Mansur, whom I rec
ognized by his arrogant shoulders and bloated
face leap*-'' out, followed by two or three, half
leading and half pushing a reluctant veiled
woman, about whose wrist I saw the crimson
handkerchief. The next Instant we had fallen
. upon them. The other men fled, yelling as If
a troop of devils were at their heels.'
Mansur alone would not leave his prey.
Drawing pword, he jiarrtpd the blow I was
aiming at his headpiece, and being skillful
enough for a few moments he seemed likely
to hold us at bay, when Jasmin, plucking out
of mv girdle the "dagger which I carried there,
â truck it into Mansur's heart.
. He gave a sort of frightful leap upward and
fell dead to the ground. One of my men took
the body, as it lay. in his arms and flung it
into the Nile. Heavily weighted as It was
with garments, it sank immediately; and tak
ln" to our horses, with Ilsamln on the saddle,
clinging to me, we fled all fhnt night, until we
were many miles from Masr al Atlga-
For ten days we camped pmone the ruins of
the ancient Nile temples, keeping watch and
ward. Then, as If returning from a shooting
expedition, we went back publicly into Al
Cairo, my men nil about me,- and Ilsamin rid
ing as a young Mameluke boy among them.
On arriving at my palace I made inquiries,
and was told that Abu Dahab had fallen under
All's displeasure, that he had fled by the des
ert, as it wa3 thought, meaning to stir up
trouble in Syria.
"What was the occasion of his sudden down
fall? The Calrenes had a thousand stories
all different, mostly incredible. â¢
Within a few clays Ali Bey sent for me to
come to the cttadel. I put on a bold face and
obeyed the summons. He was full of courtesies
and announced his acquiescence in all that
Karim Khan had proposed. Would I in return
persuade my master to join the Egyptians In
&n assault on the Turkish power? I prom-
Ised bo far a<s in me lay. ami was rÂ»t;ring.
wh-'n All broke out Into a furious Invective
against the traitor Abu Dahab.
He thundered against a slave whom he had
raised from the dust, to whom he had given
his daughter in marriage, and who, having
lost some vile Christian girl, had been shame
less enough to charge the Princess with conniv
ing at her escape and was mad enough to send
her back to the Fash*.
Well for him that he had put spurs to his
horre the sam? hour. He would have had the
courbash laid to him until the breath was out
of his body.
In all this I -wondered at our good fortune,
and I asked myself. Where was Masud? Ah!
unhappy, I saw him, too, and how changed.
He appeared in my palace a month later, so
weak and crippled I started back at the sight
of him. He had fallen under Abu Dahab's
suspicion and had been frightfully tortured;
but he kept his lips close, underwent a thou
sand deaths, and would have perished had
not the great lady claimed him as her slave.
Tender-hearted Masudâ l suffered him to epeak
with Ilsamin once more. He said but little,
and never came again. I knew afterward that
he died of a broken heart.
My time in Egypt was drawing to a disas
trous end. News came of my dear master's
death, and soon after sentence of perpetual
banishment was pronounced against me and
other of his friends by that foolish Rehoboam
'who succeeded him. I did not dare seek out
Jasmin's father while the war went on In
Bradley of Los Angeles. There was the
Initiation of two candidates, when the
officers gave an impressive rendition of
the ritualistic work
Last Friday night there was a large
meeting of Juniors and their friends in
the hall of U. S. Grant Council on the
occasion of a union meeting held under,
the auspices of the council named. A
number of Interesting and instructive ad
dresses were delivered by prominent
members.
Junior Past State Councilor-H. M. Bel
linger was a visitor to Abraham Lincoln
Council at its last held meeting. He was
accompanied by Messrs. Starr and Brad
ley of Los Angeles and H. Paine,' the new
State secretary. The delegates to tne
State Council presented, their reports,
which covered all the details of, the sev
eral sessions, and the reports were ac
cepted with thanks to the delegates. The
session of the council closed with a pleas
ant hour, during which there were ad
dresses by the visitors and recitations.
From the addresses it appeared that the
prospects ior the order at this time are
very bright.

functions given by this ever wideawake
court. The attendance filled the hall
comiortably, the decorations were artis
tic, the programme of music was well ar
ranged and the music was all that could
be desired.
COMPANIONS F. OF A.
| Grand Chief Companion Ira W. Coburn

Mrs. L. Atwood, G. R. S. and deputy of
the circle; Mrs. E. \V: Haughy. G. T. ;
Mrs. A. Davis, grand trustee, and a num
ber of visitors from local circles. The
circle room was prettily decorated and
the exemplification of the work wa all
that the most, fastidious could desire, so
carefully was it given" with attention to
detail. There were a number of addresses
and at the close of these J. J. Cordy, on
behalf of the circle, presented the grand
chief companion a handsome wall pocket,
a tall vase and a bunch of lilacs to the
grand sub-chief and a like token to the
district deputy. He also, on behalf of Mrs.
E. Berg, the chief companion, presented
the district deputy a handsome porte

were given because of true fraternal fe.-l
inir toward the recipients.
During the evening Mrs. Cordelia Evan
gfhne Tucker and Mrs. M. A. Duke were
elected delegates to the Grand Circle and
Syria and Abu Dahab heM Damascus. At
Cairo was a prison out of which we might es
cape, but perhaps not later. I resolved oa
taking- Jasmin to France and marrying her acr
cording to the Catholic rite. We embarked in
a Krench vessel, were driven out of our course,

local circles were with Lorely Circle
(German), it being the occasion of the of-,
flcial visitation. The reports showed that
this circle has of late been improving in
membership and finance and that its pros
pects for advancement are more flatter
ing at this time than they have been for
many months past. There were short ad
dresses by the grand officers and visitors. .
and by Mrs. Helena Worms, the district
denuty. After the close of the circle there
was served a collation.

addresses by the visiting officers and '
oth< rs. and then followed the presentation
of tokens of esteem to Grand. Chief Com
panion Coburn, Grand Subchief Mrs Ja

out in the fog districts. The circle has
elected Mrs. L. Sheridan as delegate to

THE NATIONAL UNION.
California Council at its last held meet
ing had a good attendance, as in addition
to the routine business there was the trial
of A. A. Banz. the doorkeeper, for alleged
neglect of duty in failing to make a
h when called upon by the speaker
to do so. It was a trial by a jury and
when the case Was submitted the' jurv
found the accused not guilty and recom
mended that all engaged in the prosecu
tion be punished. It was a mock trial and
productive of a great deal of amusement
At the meeting of the cabinet on the 24th
of March there was ;t good attendance of
the delegates, and the several committees
on entertainment in celebration of the an
niversary of the order reported progress

Now T guess that Mr. Ellis wishes he
had taken my gratuitous advice and
played his opera company In Oakland
instead of Sacramento. Oakland, which
lias long led the State In church
going, would certainly have turned out
stronger for "Carmen" than Sacra
mento did "ii last Thursday night. The
Ellis opera company ran up against a
Bensational Episcopal divine, who point
ed out to bis Hock that the performance
would tak" place on Holy Thursday.
With ardent alliteration ht gave them
the choice Christ and Tar
nifn"; and "Carmen" lost. Thf-re was
a whole row of seats for every person
in the audience. I am told, and the man
of God stt od "in on the sidewalk and
rejoiced at the throng that never came.
Now tliis good gentleman â who doubt
less would hayÂ» encouraged the per
formance of an oratorio which exposed
the Messiah in creased trousers and a
frock coat â was perhaps inspired by the
best intentions in the world; but he was
out of bounds, interfering with the free
dom of the people and the influence of
art.
If Sacramento's church music is no
better than most of our own, even a
Sunday night performance by the Ellis
AMUSEMENTS.

Company would not have been a dis
advantage to the congregation. The
gentlemen of the cloth are having alto
gether too much to say about the stage
these dayÃ. It Is largely due to their
fanatical puffery that auch tainted sen
sations in religious toggery as "The
Sign of the Cross" and "The Christian"
are sprung upon a decent God-fearing
public. A recent editorial In the Dra
matic Mirror says with sound convic
tion: "The tendency of the shoemaker
to dabble in politics and the clergyman
to sit in judgment on theatrical per- j
formancea ought not to be encouragt d.
The shoemaker should stick to his last
: and the clergyman to his pulpit."

Lan Maclaren, the famous author anfl
divine, will comme nce a Merles of three
reading's at the California Theater next
Wednesday evening. The Rev. John Wat
son needs no introduction to San Fran
cisco audiences, for no city in the Union
showed a higher appreciation of his
preat bonk. "Beside tin- Bonnie Briar
Hush." Wherever the great author and
clergyman lias appeared in tins country
his success has been most marked. Cora
rnenting on one of his readings the New
Sfork Tnnes said:
"While the author and clergyman has.
some of the methods of delivery which
belong peculiarly to the pn! pit, he show
ed himself to be a raconteur, an orator,
and at times an actor of no mean order.
His enunciation la wonderfully pood. In
his reading of hits from "The Annals of
Drumtochty' he stopped continually to
explain by verbal note what he had
meant to show. The readings Have a new
meaning almost to some of the passages,
and showed as mmU art in the recital
as in the writing of the story."
Saver Coming.
Bauer, the eminent pianist, will be heard
in two recitals at the Grand Â£)pera-house
on the afternoons of April 19 and 21. He
ranks with the best and has a temperat
111.'nt somewhat similar to Paderewski's.
Wherever he has appeared In America he
has completely captured his audiences.
There is some talk of John Philip Sousa
and George H. Broadhurst collaborating
in the production of a comic opera.
London surprise that Ada Rehan is to
play a part in the next melodrama at the
Drury Lane is coupled, in the newspa
pers, with the recollection that she pub
lished a disdainful refusal, only several
apo. of an offer from Beerbohm
Tree of an engagement in his company.
The fact is that Miss Rehan will not sep
arate from Aiijuistin Daly. The rensa
tional piece in which she is to appear in
on will subsequently be brought to-
New York by him and she will come back,
with it.
Henry Arthur Jones' new play, "Carnac
Sahib," will have a Kipling atmosphere,
as its nine scenes are all laid in India.
Mr. Tree, Mrs. James Brown Potter and
Lewis Waller will have the leading roles..

EASTERN MARKETS.
NKW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April I.â Many advances were
recorded on the stock market to-day in very
large dealings, for the two hours nearly 650.00)
'shares changing hands. The Easter holidays
In England rendered l^>ndon no factor here,
but the accumulation of a very large volume
of purchasing- orders over the Good Friday
holidays brought forth much higher quota
tions at the opening. Subsequently heavy real
izing caused a sharp setback to prices, but
with the appearance of the bank statement,
Which the speculative element viewed as more
favorable than expected, there was a material
rally and the finul prices were at or near the
best. The dealings were much Influenced by
the buoyancy of Manhattan, which made a
gain of 15 points, 9of which it held The
B'talement by a large holder of Manhattan that
he had been offered 15 per cent above Thrus
day's price for the stock was indicative that
the Metropolitan Street Railroad people sought
Control of the stock. The announcement that
iÂ» 5 pÂ«r cent dividend per annum had been de
â¢clded upon for Federal Steel with the first
quarterly dividend payable in July brought
forth enormous purchases and a very wide
opening, the extreme rise being over ti points
Among the specialties, Third Avenue rose
10 points and there were advances of 1% to
â¢4% points In American Tin Plate, People's Gas,
American Steel,- Union Paper and National
Steel, the latter recording the extreme gain
There was a comparatively narrow movement
in American Tobaci on the announcement of
a 100 per cent common stock dividend, the stock
retaining 1 point of the 3% points' advance.
The railroads averaged fractional advances
The extreme high prices in many stocks, par
. tlcularly the specialties, were accompanied by
lively bullish bidding up by brokers.
The operations of the. week were generally
of a professional character, but genuine in
.vestment demand also appeared in a number
or standard stocks.
There was a rise of 11 points net in North
western, with lesser appreciation In the other
Vanderbilts on renewed talk of some amalga
mations. Pennsylvania and Hock Island iver<-
Etrong, with the movement strong In the rest
of the railways, the Pacifies being up and the
coalers lagging. There were many sensational
advances among the specialties. Hrouklyn
Tranoit sold over 100 points above the current
quotations of a year back, the stock showing
a net advance of over 16 points for the week
Federal Ste*t roue 18% on dividend prospects;
Third Avenue, 19; Tobacco, 17; Manhattan
15%; Metropolitan. 10%; Sugar, 9, and People's
(jas. 5%. Manhattan's rise was associated with
the belief that the Metropolitan Company
sought control.
The -bond market generally exhibited a good
tone, with active lelns showing the most
strength In the movement.

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, April 1.-The New York Finan
cier says:-
Operations with the. sub-treasury and the
consummation of several pending railroad and ' â 
industrial transactions, which temporarily drew
money from this center to the Interior were re
sponsible for the loss of $.1.596.000 In cash, as
reported by the New York banks for the week
! ending April 1. The reduction of $3,333,700 in 1
deposits can be traced for the most part to this
source, and while the deposit contraction
lightened reserve liabilities by over 1800,000, the
' surplus reserve, because of the cash loss. Is
t5.062.575 lower than for the previous week. It '
has been expected, In view of the revival of
! the Stock Exchange activity, that loans would
show a large gain, and the expansion of only
$469,300 Is very much less than had been pre
! dieted. The statement, owing to special com
plications that ulways appear during the April
settlement and for other reasons alluded to,
cannot be interpreted with any degree of
accuracy. It Is known, for Instance, that there
I has been a quiet accumulation of sterling ex
change for some time past, In anticipation of
the Spanish indemnity payment, and this, while
It doÂ«*s not show, may have had more or
less to do in determining the character of the
statement.
The sains and losses In totals are confined j
1 for the most part to a few of the larger banks, j
; The main fact which the exhibit sets forth is !
. that the banks have roundpd the usual spring !
period with a larire available reserve. From,
this time on gains, rather than losses, will be
the rule. It Is expected that money will be
flowing this way shortly and domestic ex-
I change at various interior points Is now at
par or a premium, after having s.>M at a dis- j
count for some weeks.. The rise of sterling ex
: change to international parity merely reflects
the preparations for the Spanish settlement.
: It Is hoped to complete this payment by draw
ing against our balance abroad. If this can :
; be done the banks here will Bain to the full
: amount of the fund until the Treasury calls
I from It again. Indications potnt to easier
money from now on. bat Philadelphia and other
i citle.B report a constant demand for commercial
paper, that, if continued, will have an itn
i portant efft-ct in determining rates for the I
! summer. Stock Exchange activity, however,
I which promises to exceed anything heretofore 1
j known, will be the main influence In this con- |
j nectlon.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. April I.â The prevalence or wintry
weather was thf governing Influence In wheat
at the start, and as a ruined wheat crop be
came the leading thought, buyers were very
! much In the ascendant. May opened %c to %c
higher at from 73% c up to 74c, and rose quickly
to 74'^c. In the mentlme July,"- which opened
at from 73% c to 7S%e. had crawled up to 74', <â¢.
Th minimum temr>erature, however, rhanged
the cjurse of the market and the indications
were â  for continued unseasonable weather.
The world's shipments during the week were
estimated at about 8,000,000 bushels, or about
1,000,000 bushels In excess of the European re
quireraents. The Northwest receipts and weak
ness of,, the New YoYk market were the chief
factors on the bear side of the market. The New
York weakness was interpreted as a reflection
of the bearish feeling abroad. The market was
subject to many changes during the session,
according as cron damace or present abund
ance predominated In the minds of speculators
The crop news, was generally of a gloomy
character, the exception being a report by the
Modern Miller, a St. Louis publication, which
claimed that notwithstanding prevailing un
favorable news and backwardness of the pea
son there would be an average yield of winter
Wheat. Toward the end of the session the bulls
lost their grip on the market and May. after
many vicissitudes, declined to 72% c. It closed
.at 72% c. July sold twice during the day as
high i 8 74% c and down to 73% c. On the next
bulge It reached 74c, but dropped back to 72% c
. closing at 72% c. . '
A good speculative business was done In corn,
: but the market was exceptionally choppy.
Country offerings were said to be increasing
! and the bull crowd became disgusted. ' May lost

The. Hny market is off again, as. receipts are

The circular of Scott- & Magner says of Hay:
"Receipts of Hay on the San Francisco mar
ket for the past week have . amounted to'2Coo
tons. Since the late rains farmers and holders
of Hay generally have shown their anxiety' to
sell by rushing their Hay In here In excessive
quantities daily. The accumulations that were
held over from last week on account of the in
ability to handle through the rains, added to
this week's dally heavy arrivals, hnve broken
the market badly. The arrivals this week have
been more than double what , the demand re
quires. Consumers and huyers generally do not
want to load up. In the face of these heavy
shipments many sacrifices have had to'be made
on prices to .effect sales, i Shippers have been
generally advised to hold oft their shipments
and allow the market to shape Itself up. This
advice apparently has been absolutely dis
regarded, and the result is a market swamped
with Hay of all descriptions..- If shippers. win
allow the market a chance to straighten out
and then ship moderately it would probably be
better for all parties concerned."

A Virginia City exchange says: The start
ing of a raise above the north drift from the
140-foot level station of the old Sierra Nevada
shaft to connect with the Rlley tunnel work
ings, will not only result in draining the water I
encountered in sinking a winze on the ore cut
In driving the tunnel, but will demonstrate in
which direction the ore trends, and whether
the failure to Intersect Its downward con
tinuation in advancing the north drift at a
depth of 100 feet below the tunnel floor is due
to a faulting in the vein. When work was
suspended In the winze a few feet below the
tunnel level on account of an inflow of water,
the ore in the winze bottom, according to Su
perintendent Kyle's report, was showing
stronger and was higher grade than at the
point where it was cut on the tunnel level
and should further explorations result In dem- |
onstratlng that the ore continues downward
the raise to connect with the Rlley tunnel
workings will furnish an ample supply of air
for prospecting the ground at a depth of 100
feet below the tunnel level.

FAR up the side of a beautiful
Berkeley hill dwell two little
Kirls named Alice and Helen
Daversâ little twin Bisters, 8
years old, who love each other
dearly. I think they must have been
born >m Wednesday, for they were al
"merry and glad."
Hut three days b< fore Easter Monday
they had a very sad experience, and I
shall have to take you back to the
beginning of Lent to make you under
stand how it all happened, and also
tell you a little bit about their home
life.
They lived In such a pretty home,
completely covered with roses, but they
were very poor; so poor that the father
and mother worked hard to keep the
little girls comfortable and happy.
They knew nothing of the pleasures
you little city girls enjoy, but how
could two little girls feel poor who
could picnic every day and gather all
the wild flowers they wanted?
Ned such a nice, gentle cow,
ami chickens, and such a funny little
id last, but not least, the little
Spot, who did such wonderful
tricks.
In this beautiful world of ours the
fact is sad but true that no matter how
â¢ur blessings, there is always
Lhing more to be desired, and so it
with our little heroines. They
:ht themselves very happy little
indeed until one day, very
near the beginning of Lent, they were
invited to a party â such a delightful
party, with plenty of ice cream and
â¢andy and everything dear to the heart
if a child. If they only might go to a
every day, how nice it would be.
Going home that afternoon the little
gerly talked the matter over.
"Of course, we can't go to a party
â vi â !â >â  day," said Helen, "but if we beg
mother very hard she might let us give
â t our home."
"But, Helen," paid Alice, "do you
think we could have ice cream and
randy?"
"I don't know," answered Helen,
doubtfully, but after a minute's medi
tation she continued: "I have n<~"
\ that when we want things very
mother always finds a way. so
I think we will just speak to her about
it this very night."
After dinner, when the dishes were
all washed and put away and the
waery mother had settled herself for
the rest she so much needed, the little
girlfl made their request.
It was hard, Indeed, to refuse thnse
: little faces, but how could she
yes, when the necessities of lif^
so hard to obtain? So she told
the little girls they must wait for hap
days, and -they went to bed bit-

riong I say," and old Aunt Chloe
tamped her foot at the retreating
i nn s of the two young darkies as they
isappeared in the direction of the
bicken house.
Aunt Chloe re-entered the kitchen
nd busied herself getting supper
eady, but her thoughts were busy
eckoning the possible advantage of
etting- two hundred eggs at a time
nd how much profit would be derived
y this new method.
"Le' see," said Aunt Chloe, as they
at down to Bupper a little later, "them

Jeorge Dewey Brown and Richmond
'â¢â¢arson Hobson Brown turned â¢ the
C'hltes of their eyes toward each other
t nd thf-n up in a half-frightened way to
Vunt Chloe and faintly answered:
"Yepsum!"
No Easter eggs!
AH would be dull and uninteresting
f they were to have no eggs!
Oh, that they might catch the
neasles, whooping cough, smallpox,
inything, just so they would have to
itay in bed Easter day! No Easter

ibout how many egga they were going

it the old gum tree at 2 o'clock Easter
ifternoon where there would be such
1 feast of eggs as none of them had
ver dreamed of?
Of course. every one that could bring
tggs were to do so, but all were to
hare alike whether they could bring
.n egg or not. They had planned it all
.nd now the arrival of that wonderful
len that could take care of two hun-
Ired eggs' at a time had knocked the
oundatlon from under their fondly
herished plans. Naturally they would
eel somewhat crushed, just at first, for
A DEAR- little girl was taken sick, and for a long time
she was in her bed, an invalid. She could not run
about any more as other children do and the games
of merry childhood were not for her. But do not
magine that Hope and Joy were not hers. As she lay
n her bed she had the merriest companions, who made her
augh gayly. Sometimes her tears fell, but oftener for the
,voes of her little companions than for her own.
Tears glistened in her eyes for poor little "Paul Dombey"
md true-hearted "Florence." But more often she was gay.
To her "AH Baba" and hi?, fierce companions were actual
)fings, who came upon the stage, bowed to her and then
repeated the deeds told of in the "Arabian Nights." So

'Sinbad" and "Aladdin." From the "Book of Books" her
A California Easter Party
tcrly disappointed.
It happened the next day that Mrs.
Davers had to go to San Francisco to
do some shopping.
Many times during the day she was
haunted by the Bad faces of her little
danghters; and she did wish with all
her loving heart she might give them
what they desired. She made all her
small purchases and toward the close
of the afternoon stood near the Lotta
Fountain waiting for the car to take
her to the ferry.
The air was sweet with the fragrance
of wild flowers; poor, half-starved look
ing men and boys with well-filled bas
kets offered their nosegays to the pass
ing crowd.
She noted with surprise how rapidly
the wild flowers sold and what good
prices they brought.
A small, ragged little boy, noticing
her interest, stepped quickly to her
side with a large bunch of poppies, and,
offering it. said: "Only two bits, lady."
She smilingly shook her head â thinking
of the many growing on her own hill
side. Just then her car came in sight;
at the same moment a most wonderful
plan popped into- her head.
The "plan" was so absorbing she'al
most forgot to leave the car on reach
ing the ferry. The "plan" traveled with
her on the boat and in the train, and
when her station was reached every
thing was settled to the smallest de
tail.
Briskly she climbed the hill to her
little home. As she came in sight the
children ran to meet her, with Spot run
nlng at their heels.
"Why, nu/ther, how happy you look!"
cried little Helen, as she gave her a
kiss. Mother smiled and patted the lit
[rl'B cheek. "Mother is very tired."
she said, "and my little girls must ba
very helpful to-nigh^ and after dinner
Is over T have something very nice to
tell you."
<>h! how excited they were, and how
â¢they did wish they misht do without
dinmr just for that one night. But
they bravely did their best and were
really very helpful.
After the dinner was eaten and the
work all finished for the night Mrs.
Davers called the children to her. She
told them of her trip to town that day.
and how, when standing near the Lotta
Fountain watching the sale of the wild
flowers, it had occurred to her all in a
minute that her own little daughters
might turn their pleasure Into profit.
If they would gather fresh flowers
each day. arrange them prettily In a
basket and always have them ready
was not their reputation at stake.
Possibly had she known of their plans
and how the fulfilling of that mandate
would, reflect discredit on the two small
personages before her she would have
hesitated ere deciding entirely against
them. And the boys had no thought
of accomplishing what they had under
taken, namely, to contribute largely
toward an Easter feast, by taking her
into their confidence. But they had
something to do and they would do it.
They had given their word and they
must not break it, but how were they
to keep it?
The two woolly black heads were very
close together while "chores" were be
ing done that evening, and there was
much low talk, while furtive glances
were thrown toward the house lest they
be surprised and all be lost.
"If mammy cotch us, an' fin's out
wens gwlne ter fine a way ter make
'er compermize on thet aig kesthun. I
ges 't r ud end in us'ns gittin' narry a
alg, but instid V ud be th' hickry,"
said Richmond Pearson Hobson, rolling
his eyes up to his brother's face.
"But we hatnt gwine ter git th'
hickry this time, an' we'se gwln ter

an' mammy'll gin 'em to us'ns, too!"
replied George Dewey, with all the as
surance of one whose word was law.
Then there was more rolling of eyes,
shaking of heads and hushed laughter
nrhile their allotted work dragged slow
y along.
"He-ah! yo-uns! Is yer gwine ter be

Watcher doln' anyway?" and as Aunt
'hloe came slowly down the path the
two boys gathered up an armful of
wood and hurried to the house.
Nearly two weeks had passed since
the arrival of the Incubator and every
pure spirit harvested the "peace that surpasseth understand
ing."
And now it was Easttr Sunday eve. Sleep had fallen like
a soft mantle upon our young friend. She was smiling. No
wonder, for she had a kindly vision. As truly she had
a vision as these inspired ones to whose wondering. eyes a
vista of Heaven has been opened.
Upon a mountain side a dear little girl like herself toiled
painfully upward over jagged stones to reach the lovely
flowers that grew far above her. Many times she slipped
backward, many times she fell â but she never despaired.
The flowers breathed out fragrance that still drew her on,
while upon their graceful forms and beautiful coloring her
eyes feasted. The sun beat down pitilessly upon her head.
Her hands were torn by falling upon the sharp stones.
THE SIAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 2, 1899.
for father's early train she knew Mr.
Davers could dispose of them at some
of the flower stands in the city and
they might earn quite a little money.
"But what are we to do with the
money, mother?" asked Alice.
"Why, my dear little girl, you are to
give a party with it. If you are faith
ful to the plan during the forty days
of Lent by Easter Monday you will cer
tainly have enough to give the party."
Oh! how they did caper and jump
about. They kissed their mother and
each other a dozen times, for they were
too happy for words.
Then they ran out to find their father,
to see if he really wcnild help them. He
promised very readily, on the condition
that they must never keep him waiting
for even one minute. The very next
morning they were up bright and early
and the basket was well filled when Mr.
Davers started for town. The plan
worked beautifully. How proud they
felt each night as their father handed
them the money â not a very large
thing about. Aunt Chine's place was
working to her entire satisfaction, with
one single exception â the hens had been
growing more careless and indolent as
the days passed. The incubator had
evidently cast a had spell over the hens,
for the very next day only twenty-two
A Chance for You to Learn the
eggs were to be found, when there
should have been twenty-eight; and
now at the end of twelve days there
was only six. Something must be done
at once.
"He'uh, yo', Rich! Tons kin go ter
th' store 'n git sum uv that stuff ter
make hens lay. 'N yo' hurry right
straight back so's ter feed 'em ter
nlght, 'n m&yby they'll lay more aigs
to-morry," and Aunt Chloe went out
to look at the thermometer and turn
sum, but the little noara steadily grew.
A week before Easter they counted
their savings and found they had four
dollars and twenty cents. Success was
certain and they could wait no longer
to deliver the invitations.
So with mother's permission they in
vited all their little friends to come on
Easter Monda3 r , not forgetting to tell
each child there was to be plenty of Ice
cream and candy.
The week passed all too slowly.
Thursday morning the little girls sat
on the doorstep, telling Spot of the
party and the glories to come.
"He has never seen our money," Bald
Helen. "We will show it to him."
â¢ Quickly they ran for the little red
purse and disclosed to him all its
wealth; then closing it with a snap,
Helen tossed it into the air for Spot to
catch.
Spot caught it, and holding it In his
teeth instantly turned and ran off
with it over the hill. The little girls
gave Instant chase, never dreaming of
the eggs in the incubator.
"We'uns '11 hey all the aigs we want
now, fer mammy's a gittin 1 mighty
anshus 'bout not havin' any aigs saved
up ter put in ther inkerbater soon's
these'ns gits hatched." said George
Dewey on their way downtown.

"Wonder ef she'll say suthin 1 . ter
morry?" and R. P. H. looked question
ingly at his brother.
"Gee, if she knowed how many algs
wens ha' got hid in th' hay she'd say
suthin' ter-night," " quietly replied
George Dewey.
"Bet 'twill be a long time 'fore she
fines outen "bout thet," and the younger
boy wriggled about in his clothes as
though the hickory was then being ap
plied to his back.
After a time sho lias scaled the steep peak andthe flowers
are hersâ hers if she will feiatp them. But she pauses for,
far and wide, is outspread a wonderful landscape of the
whole world â so much more beautiful than anything she has
imagined â lakes, valleys and ragged mountains crowned
with snowâ that she. stands still in rapture. But, excepting
the flowers for which she has toiled so hard there are no
blossoms in her sight.
She looks down and sees far below her a weary crowd
O- people, old and young, who plod along with glances
downward, never seeing the flowers. Into her mind comes
pity for them. One moment of selfishness rules her. The
next minute she has picked the flowers and has called'.iloj 1.
From her hands the posies are thrown freely to all who,
looV : f> upward now, are surprised to see how much beauty
the trouble in store for them. They
ran till their little legs gave out and
then sat down and called him. At last
he came, barking and running toward
them, but the little red purse was
gone.
Up they jumped and searched the
hillside over, piteously calling on Spot
to help them out of their trouble, but
all of no avail.
Crying all the way, they ran home to
tell mother. She tried to comfort them,
saying father should go next morning
early and make a thorough search,
and he would be sure to find it, but
they could not be comforted.
Next morning as soon as it was light
found them all out on the hillside,
eagerly searching every inch of the
ground. It was a long and weary
search, but it met with no success, and
at last even Mr. Davers gave up and
said he was afraid it was gone forever
more.
"Oh, mother, what are we to do?"
cried the poor little sisters.
"You will have to bear this sorrow
patiently, my darlings, and perhaps, if
you are very patient, the dear Savior,
who loves little children, may reward
you some other way."
"But we have asked all the children
to come," they sobbed.
"The children shall all come, just the
same," said mother, "and we will give
them a happy day. Only we cannot
have ice cream and candy, but nice
cake and lemonade."
It was a bitter disappointment to the
poor little things, but they bravely did
their best to be cheerful and forget
their trouble, and they even tried to
forgive Spot, which was the hardest
part of all.
They returned "jest in time," Aunt
""hloe said, and after watching the hens
levour a liberal quantity of the food,
he remarked:
"Gess thet'll fix 'em. "Wens '11 hey
)lenty uv aigs now," and with a grunt
)f satisfaction she waddled off up to
he he.use, while the boys rolled their
â yes knowingly at each other.
TVhon the eggs were gathered the
next day and there w^ere only six to
be found in the nests. Aunt Chloe held
lip her hands in despair.
'Tee gwine ter look out in ther grass
n brush ter-morry," said George
Dewey, "fer it 'pears t' me urn hens
must a bin stealin' uv ther nests out

the namesake of the hero of Manila
;oolly contemplated his mammy's face,
had been passed by unheeded.
All the flowers but one she has tossed to the passers by. i
The travelers nod and smile happily. The one flower she
has saved for herself is a mountain, pansy â the heartsease. â¢
A poor, bent old woman comes along the rugged road. She <
does not look upward to tlic cheery call. Her face is set and â 
her eyes are sad and tear filled. Down goes the dear little <
girl with her one gift, places a friendly hand on the old <
woman's shoulder and hands her shyly the heartsease.
"Where did you get that, dearie?" asks the old woman. !
"Up there." answers the child, pointing up.
"Up so high â up toward heaven" â said the old woman
breathlessly. "Ah, thank you. dear, so kindly. I have long '<
forgotten to look up. Forgotten â when all true heartsease ,
comes from above." D. H. W.
EasterÂ»morning the little girls waked 4
up early. Oh, what a beautiful day it â¢
was! They never meant to be unhappy <2
*ny more. Quickly they dressed th<^m-
selves and ran out on the hillside to j
hunt for eggs, for the old brown hens Â«
had their nests all through the. tall o
green grass. It was great fun, and
after they had hunted for half an o
hour their basket was nearly filled, and T
feeling tireu they sat down under a *
spreading oak tree to rest.a few mm- â¢
utes before going home to breakfast.
They had not sat there five minutes *
before Alice exclaimed, "Helen, do you o
hear that little peep-peep? I am sure 4
there must be some little new baby S
chickens very near."
Tp they jumped to search, and sure
pnough just a short distance from their c
resting place they found an old hen 4
with eight cunning little yellow chick- %
ens. <
The old hen. did not like to be dis- 4
turbed, but they pushed her off the nest g
to count the little chicks a second time.
As they did so Helen spied something 5
small and red lying in the nest, With <
her little heart wildly beating she j
quickly picked* it up. and what do you ,
think it was? THE LITTLE RED A
PURSE! Oh, what a happy moment â¢
for the little girls! s
Entirely forgetting the basket of *
eggs, down the hill they ran, so eager c
were they to impart the good news to <
father and mother. i
Mrs. Davers had just placed the <
breakfast on the table, feeling a little *
uneasy at the children's long absence* g
when in they rushed, waving the little <
red purse in the air and shouting, 'It g
is i'<mnd, it is found; and we can have <
ice cream and candy for the party!" .
It took some time to get a clear and i
collected account of where and how it *
had been found. But great was the re- o
joicing and such a happy family sat <
down to eat their Easter breakfast, j
Spot was fed so bountifully that he re- <
fused to do any of his tricks until some g
hours later. 4
At Sunday-school that morning two j
thankful little girls said their prayers <
very earnestly and joined In the beau- 5
tiful Easter carols with all their happy <
hearts. ;
Easter Monday at last. Will they ever <
forget that happy day? .
The children all came early; not In i
the fine attire you little city girls wear *
when going to a party, but wearing c
bright little gingham frocks and sun- ,
bonnets made to play in. i
And oh! the games they played out <
among the poppies and buttercups that â¢
long, happy day! How hungry they r
were when called to the good supper ,
spread under the big oak tree, and how 5
they did eat. The ice cream was de- Â«
licioua and there was plenty of it, and i
each child had a cunning little basket <
of sugared Easter eggs to carry home, j
The day is drawing to its close. Down ,
behind the Golden Gate the sun is sink- j
ing to rest, and weary, happy little ,
children say good-night to Alice and j
Helen. The party is over, but in the (
hearts of those little children the mem- 5
ory of that happy day will linger for ,
many years. 5

from his plate of beans in well-feigned .
surprise, and Aunt Chloe raised her >
hands to her head and then brought â 
them down on her knees, exclaiming: <
"De Lawd sakes, honey chillun; I Jea â¢

"Doan know wy urn hens "ud stop <

Aunt Chloe's face beamed with self- '
satisfaction at having made such an .
excellent bargain. '
Saturday evening. Easter eve, the '
boys found they had a stock of thirty- <
nine eggs on hand. They chuckled in- '
wardly as they counted them, and i
when Aunt Chloe's back was turned â¢
they hugged each other in congratula- '
tion at the success of their scheme. <
Aunt Chloe, however, was not so well '
satisfied, and was anxious to recover ;
a portion of the victor's spoils.
" "You'ns made de bargain, 'n now yo' <
doan wanter stan' by't. Reckon ef .
wens hadden worked mighty hard '
huntin' nestus thet wus hid, you'ns ud <

"No, no, honey chile; you's ben '

an' you's done earned ever' one of dem '

" 'Pears ter me we'uns mltus well '

'n mammy kin hey dem fifteen ter cook :

F.ichmond Pearson Hobson, and wag j
assented to by the other, much to Aunt '
ChLoe's satisfaction. \
The next day, Easter, was bright and :
beautiful, and at 2 o'clock two small |
brown figures emerged from Aunt (
Chine's kitchen door bearing a pail be

in each chocolate-colored face and two
pairs of black eyes glanced toward !
each other In a very funny manner
Finally one said: <

i from those you have idealized; your
' heart line shows much sorrow; ihere is a
mark of separation in your hand; you
will have a serious illness between 40 and
5u years of age.
ROBERT Mo.â Your life line shows
great vitality: you will barely escape .an
accident which "might have cost you your
life; you have mechanical and BCientlflc
ability: you have had great disappoint
i ments in' financial affairs; the latter half
of your life will be much more fortunate;
i one' enemy, who will secretly try to injure
YOU.
MR. D. F. P.â You have great scientific
1 and mechanical ability; you will have
â  financial success; you have many voy
j agesâ one very long one; there is a square
: on the fate line, a mark of preservation
from accident; a long life is shown; In
1 the future your heart affairs will be much
more satisfactory.
T R. G.â Yours is the hand of a phil
osopher; one marriage is shown: your life
i line does not show the strongest of con
stitutions; you are sensitive and refined;
yu have executive and musical ability;
your fate line shows for a few years you
! will not have great financial success;
there are several journeys of importance.
MISS VIOLETâ Your hand shows decis
ion of character; you have had many
! trials and sorrows; the life line shows one
serious Illness, but there being a square
of preservation on the head line It shows
that the illness will not prove fatal;
ih^re is one important Journey in the near
future; you are cautious and courageous;
jour hand shows interference of relatives.
MME. I..â You have a hand showing
f"iidness of detail. Your conical finger
tipa show perfect eye for color. You have
j.rtistic ability. There are several voy
ages or journeys of importance. One in
fluence that has marred your life. You
have great tact and business ability.
MRS. L.. Rio Vistaâ You are a person
' of principle and live in accordance with

ing, but inclined to be too exacting of
cithers. You are close In money matters.
A good, careful manager.
MISS H. MARTENSâ You are ambitious
and have a good deal of ability, but you
lack the power to concentrate your atten
tion enough to make a great success of
any undertaking. You are reckless and
daring, often going to extremes. There ls
one influence in the life which brings sor
row.
MRS. ML, Belmontâ You have a very
artistic temperament, keenly alive to
everything that is beautiful and harmoni-
I ous. Your head line shows good brain
' power, but your life line shows illness in
! early life.
M., Belmontâ An easy-going nature,
! guided by good judgment and plenty of
i common-sense. One who though he has
high ideals is not blinded to the practical
side of life. You are genial and make
I friends readily. You are not susceptible
! to flattery-
H. P., Berkeleyâ Your hand shows
a great depth of affection and an intense
; interest in the opposite sex. You will
< marry and be bereft of your companion

' your head and life lines. You will have
marked financial success after 38.
MRS. TINAâ The hand indicates a
I changeable, restless nature, inconstant
in affections; can easily transfer them.
: yel you are calculating even in matters
lof love. Your life has been an eventful
j one. Two marriages plainly marked. A
' most serious Illness is shown In the life
line between 45 and 50. Many changes
uithln the next fifteen months.
OSCAR S. , Beniciaâ Your hand shows
I a level-headed, broad-minded, Inde
pendent thinker. You are self-reliant and
not easily daunted. You are extremely
sensitive and can be wounded deeply
where your affections are concerned.
One marriage.
MR. YOl'NGâ You are practical, strong
minded and have good mental capacity.
You adapt youself readily to circum
stances. You will live to a good old age
and make a happy marriage.
MISS C. M. L,.â Your hand shows many
struggles and trials. Your family has In

performed your duties faithfully. Your
life line shows a serious Illness between
86 and 30. Many changes within the next
two years.
K. L. O.â You have a aouhle nature,
not to be relied upon. Affable, suave,
conceited. A man of considerable means.
Your stupidity has caused others much
sorrow. Have been divorced. Will marry
again. The second wife will be very
charming. You will be her slave and she
will have the power to make you very
joalous. You will travel, and after two
years of a very unsettled existence she
will leave you and once again you will
be free, but leaving you very Indifferent
to the opposite sex.
H. F., Santa Cruzâ You have a keen in
