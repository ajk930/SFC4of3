VOLUME LXXXV-NO. 64.
HIS PRISON COT
A FUNERAL PYRE
ANTHONY BUROIiE, desperate
and demented, has made good
his threat to end his life. He
chose a horrible and unlooked
for mode. of death. He was
confined in the County Jail awaiting
transportation to the- penitentiary,
and notwithstanding that he was
being guarded by two other pris
oners in the same cell with him he
succeeded in setting fire to the mat
tress of his bed yesterday and roast
ing himself to death. His cell
mates in attempting to extinguish
the flames were severely injured.
Burgle was a. caterer and kept a
restaurant in the business part of
the city. Sigmund L. Braverman,
a wholesale Jeweler, was his land
lord, and had him ejected from the
premises for not paying his rent.
Fired with the desire to be re
venged he loaded his revolver and
proceeded to Braverman's office, at
121 Post street, on July 4, 1897, and
opened fire upon Braverman.
Braverman was also armed and re
turned the fire, .planting four bul
letfl in Burgles body, himself es
caping without injury. Both men
were arrested for assault to murder,
but Braverman proved that Burgle
had made threats against his life
BURNS GIVES HIMSELF

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. I.â To show how readily
the Burna men" grasp at everything
that turns up and claim everything the
fact is cited that when Wright was dis
graced and practically ckposed from
the Speakership and Mr. Anderson was
elected to preside over the Assembly,
they immediately claimed that they se
( ured the election of the latter. Again.
when Wright was to be placed on com
mittee, the touts boasted that Ander-
Bon would appoint the ex-Speaker to

and was the aggressor. The charge
against Braverman was dismissed,
but Burgle was convicted .and sen
tenced to seven years' imprisonment
in the penitentiary.
Pending an appeal to, the Supreme
Court he was confined in the County
Jail.. A short time ago.thu court
decided adversely against him, but
the jail officials kept it a secret from
Burgle, fearing that he would make
an attempt upon his life. On July
3 of last year Burgle hanged himself
to the wicket of his cell with a rope
made of a bed sheet cut into strips,
but he was cut down by jail officials
before life became extinct. Since
that time Henry Bacon, accused of
arson, and J. H. Cummings, ac
cused of obtaining money by false
pretenses, had been placed with
Burgle in cell 32 in the upper tier,
to watch any attempt he might
make to do away with himself.
Between 5 and 5:15 o'clock yester
day morning Deputy Sheriff James
Phillips, in making the rounds of
the jail, passed Burgles cell. There
were three beds in the cell, one on
each side and one. against- the rear
wall, the latter being "occupied by
Burgle. As Phillips passed the cell
all was quiet, but trai next moment
ittee the claim was at once set up
that Raub was appointed according to
Burns' programme. ,
The cold fact is that Speaker Ander
son made no programme with or prom
ise to the Burns following. He appoint
ed Raub on his own motion, without
consulting the wishes of the touts -on
or off the floor of the Assembly. This
is but another. evidence of the desper
ate straits into which the Burns follow
ers are driven. Burns has even
Reached the limit of deceiving- his own
touts. This thing of looking wise is
played to a finish. Not being able to
deceive others. Burns is now trying to
deceive himself.

he was startled by a scream, and
running to the wicket he saw Burgle
and his bed wrapped in; -flames and
Bacon and Cummings trying to put
out the fire.
Phillips unlocked the door and as
sisted Bacon and Cummings in
hustling the burning man into the
corridor. Then he gave the fire
alarm and the flames were extin
guished with a few buckets of
water.

Last Tuesday evening Burgle sent
for- a priest and was visited by. one

made his confession. He gave no
intimation at that time or after that

BURNS' DESPERATE STRAITS
HERRIN HAS HIS
TOWLINE OUT
FOR MERCHANTS
Corporation Influence Being Exerted in a
Final Roundup.
TRYING HARD TO POLL CLARK OVER
0. A. Hale of San Jose Has Now Joined the Army of the
Mexican and Is Doing His Share of the
Wirepulling Among Legislators.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. I.â W. F. Herrin
of the Southern Pacific R lilroad
gives a slight degree of attention
to the company's law business,
but devotes his time chiefly to peddling
railroad tickets for political bosses. He
is now active in a long pull and a last
pull to line up every man within the
reach of the corporation's influence to
sustain the failing fortunes of
Burns as a candidate for the Senate.
The last reach is for big merchants and
iieavy shippers.
â  On the scene to-night appears O. A.
Hale' of San Jose, a well-known busi
ness man and " prominent citizen of
Santa Clara County. With him is a.
large delegation interested in the ' hris
itkm which he has at heart. A few days
before : the Legislature ratt Mr. Hale
professed the ' highest, admiration " for
the . Senatorial qualities j possessed by
General , Barnes, but. now admits that
he v ?vvbald vote- for D. M. Burns if he had
a vote in the Legislature. Not , ; having
a vote the latest recruit in Dan's army
â¢is turning his attention â¢to ' Assembly
man Clark, who hails from the Moun
tain View District of Santa Clara
County. - Clark has been voting for U.
S. Grant since the balloting began, but
his presence in the Burns camp is most
earnestly desired. Ordinary methods of.
persuasion have failed to convince him
that a change of base from Grant to
Burns would be advisable. The touts
pulled and pulled at the Mountain View
lawmaker, but to no avail. Herrin was
requested to get in and do some pulling
and hauling, -hence the presence of the
big delegation from Santa Clara, headed
by Hale.
Hale admits that he had an interview
with Clark this afternoon and urged
the Assemblyman to use his best ef
forts to break the deadlock. "I did not
ask Mr. Clark to vote for Dan Burns,"
said Mr. Hale, '"but I told him that the
people desired that the deadlock should
be broken and a Senator elected."
Five or six times Mr. Hale was asked
concerning his own preferences for
United States Senator, and the clever
manner in which he diverted the dis
cussion to another current of talk
would have been creditable to a dip
lomat. Finally, when all the talk was
gone over and over again concerning
the desirability of electing a Senator at
this session, Mr. Hale, responding to
the previous question, said: "If I were
in the Legislature I would vote for Dan
Burns."
There is no question, therefpre, con
cerning Mr. Hale's preference. While
he did not in so many words ask As
semblyman Clark to vote for Burns, he
suggested that he should vote for some
other candidate than Grant in order to
break the deadlock, and also suggested
the caucus method of settling the ques
tion of the Senatorship. Every one
familiar with the situation here knows
that Burns' last, lingering chance of
success lies in a dark lantern caucus.
The pressure of county committees and
all the force that can be exerted by a
rally of touts bear on this point.
The spectacle of Hale as a tout for
Dan Burns is presented to the people
of Santa 1 Clara County. Had a single
member of the Santa Clara delegation
expressed before . the election a pur
pose to vote for Burns an overwhelm
ing vote would have been cast against
him. A few of the politicians of San
Jose are for Burns, but Mr. Hale knows
quite well that the great majority of
people of Santa Clara County and a
large percentage of the citizens repre
sented by Assemblyman Clark would
regard Burijs' election to the Senate as
disgraceful and disastrous.
Hale is here ostensibly in the interest
o* legislation favorable to the Agnews
Asylum. He does not say that the Sen
atorshlp cuts any figure in regard to the
proposed legislation bearing on public
institutions, but the hint is thrown out
that opposition to Burns might imperil
the allowances to the institution. There
has been a good deal of wild and boast
ful talk about the State patronage
which is to be distributed to the friends
of the colonel aÂ«id the smooth sailing
in the Legislature which will be given
to measures introduced by the friends
of the "organization."
Members of the Legislature will stand
threats of this nature to a certain limit,
WARNING TO THE HONEST
CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Feb. 1 â So far as the candidacy
of D. M. Burns is concerned, the Senatorial situation in Sacramento has
reached a point where it is necessary that the citizens of California should be
given warning of what is being done to besmirch the fair fame of the State
and circumvent the wishes a! the majority of her people.
Thousands of dollars are being spent to send men to every county in the
State for the purpose of inducing county central committees to pass resolu
tions instructing individual members of the Legislature to either vote for
Burns or go into caucus.
femissaries of the Southern Pacific Company and of certain members of
the Republican State Central Committee have been sent far and wide with
instructions to use the threat of discrimination in freight rates and discrimi
nation in the distribution of State patronage to force men to come to Sacra
mento and seek to pull down hoiiest legislators who have been voting as
their consciences dictated and as the majority of the voters of their districts
desire them to vote.
As a consequence, the streets, the lobbies and the corridors of the
Â° Capitol are thronged with a certain class o? men who are seeking to debauch
<> the legislators and to make rascals of honest men. Never before in the his
e tory of California have such shpmeul scenes been witnessed during the
etection of a United States Senator. Honest men throughout the State
â¢ should do what is possible for Uiem to do to save their representatives in
â¢ the Legislature from yielding to threats and temptation, and thus save them
â¢ and the State from lasting disgrace.

but when the limit is reached they will
turn about and give the Burns men a
dose of the same medicine. Burns can
iline up twenty-four men to support or
oppose any measure of legislation, but
if he should attempt to use that force
to punish members who did not support
him for, Senator he would soon find a
solid organization in the Assembly that

would set at defiance Dibble and his
much-talkod-of committee on rules.
There is no occasion for alarm in
Hale's mind concerning: the allowances
for the Agnews Asylum. The Legisla
ture, regardless of politics, will attend
to the support trf public institutions. It
is best to brush away all dust and rub

INCIDENTS OF THE DAY AT SACRAMENTO.
ANOTHER VOTE,
BUT NO SLUMP
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Feb. I.â The thirty
seventh and thirty-eighth ballots have resulted In no change and the
Burns touts have dammed the flow of wine that flowed in anticipation
of the general break that was to follow the Investigation report.
The committee that left to-day for San Francisco to attend the funeral
of Senator Boggs reduced the total of vote? cast.butthere was nary slump.
The first ballot taken gave the leaders 2:2 and 19. Grant, of course, lead
ing. Grant's extra vote was the result of an unpaired absentee and on
the second ballot the mistake was rectified and he got but 21.
The vote was as follows:

Take him all in all. Hole is the most

is not saying that he is the most influ

P' ing on at first glance and immediate
ly began the work of counteracting the
Influence of Herrin's mercantile agen-
All of the influence that Burns and
Herrin may bring to bear on Assembly
man Clark will never serve to bring
him into the Burns camp.
"I intend to stay with Grant so long
as he is in the fight," he sajd to-night,
"and no one can change my purpose.
Should Grant draw out of the contest,
or if the future should bring about con
ditions such as in my opinion would
make it impossible for him to win, then
I would vote for the man who would
be most acceptable to my constituents.
"I know that but very few men in
my district favor the candidacy of Dan
Burns. I have received scores of let
ters and telegrams from men who live
in both the commercial and agricultur
al sections of my district, but not one
of them ever contained a request for
me to support Burns. As a matter of
fact, I know that the great majority
of my people are opposed to his candi
dacy. I shall never vote for a man who
does not represent the choice *of the
majority of my constituents, and. no
amount of persuasion will serve to
change my mind in this respect."
Other members of the San Jose polit
ical delegation who joined with Hale
in trying to force Mr. Clark into the
Burns camp wer.e ex-Mayor Koch. Paul
P. Austin, Al Fage and Sam Rucker. a
Democrat.
Mr. Herrin will have to throw his line
in other waters, for there are no fish
for him in the Mountain View district.
Being in desperate straits, he has re
sorted to desperate remedies, but
though he has taken off the mask and
come out in the open, he appears as a
bogie man who is terrible only to chil
dren.
The day for the grand round up of
the Burns forces to show the railroad
that the colonel is not yet a "dead one"
has been postponed until Monday of
next week. Last Saturday the touts
boasted in San Francisco that the
"colonel" could be elected on Wednes
day. Subsequently the date was post
poned until Friday. Now comes - the
third announcement that the touts will
parade their reserved forces next Mon
day.
In spite of many precautions, secrets
Will leak frotn the yellow building. The
story told on the inside is that the
"colonel" must make a showing this
â week, and that if he cannot produce
Borne substantial evidence of increased
strength the assembly in New York
representing the Searle, Stanford,
Crocker and Huntington interests in
the Southern Pacific Company will pro
ceed to designate a new candidate. The
assembly will have its first meeting to
morrow. Russell Wilson, representing
one of the interests, is due to arrive
in New York to-night. Herrin will be
advised as to the man who may be se
lected to take Burns' plaoe as the rail
road candidate for United States Sena
tor from California.
The representatives of the corpora
tion are said to be willing to make a
reasonable struggle to carry out the
â¢wishes of Herrin, but they are not
ready to consent to a prolongation of
the deadlock. Phil Crimmins and Mar
tin Kelly, who control four members of
the San Francisco delegation in the
Legislature, have scented the coming
deal and want to be near the yellow
building when the first intimation of
the impending change of base comes
from Now York. They went to San
Francisco to-day to get instructions
and advice as to the deadlock.
Some intelligence concerning: the
plans In New York must have reached
the Grant headquarters here by wire.
The upholding of Assemblyman Clark
against the efforts of the Santa Clara
delegation is not a victory of sufficient
magnitude to cause the elation which
exists among the followers of Grant
to-night. The feeling of joy is pro
durf-d by some information of another
character.
The tout? are still claiming the sup
port of members of the Legislature who
cannot under any circumstances be
persuaded, coerced or entranced into
the support of Burns or his caucus
Fcheme. Th<- belief that Burns cannot
win out was never so widespread as it

confidence 'among themselves, express

For a State Circulating Library.
'AIT. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Feb. I.â An jitetmpt was made
in the Senate this afternoon to make the
State Library a kind of circulating
library.
ppr.a;r, r Trout's bill cam" up on second
reading. Th<- present law provides that
the State Library Trustees shall be elect
ed by the Legislature in joint session.
Senator Trout's bill amends that clause in
this way:
"The State Library is under the control
of a board of trustees, consisting of live
members, holding their offices for the
term of four years, and' appointed by the
Governor in the following manner, to
â wit: Three trustees shall be. appointed
for the full term of four years and from
and after the 6th day of April. 1902- and
two trustee? shall be appointed for the
tÂ»rm of two years from and after said
date. After expiration of the terms of
office of the trustees appointed as abovr
provided, their successors shall there
after be appointed for the full term of
four years. Appointments to tiil vacan
cies caused by death, resignation or re
moval shall be for the unexpired term
only. Nothfng herein shall be con
etrued to interfere with the terms of of
fice of the present members of said
board."
The only fight over the bill was as to
one clause denning the powers and duties
of the board. This clause included a
provision for the loaning of books with
such guarantee for their safe return as
the board may deem proper. â  The adop
tion of this clause would have the ef
fect of making the State Library a cir
culating library in that a resident of
Siskiyou or San Diego could borrow books
and if any citizen came here to search
authorities those books might be out on
loan at either end of the State.
Senator Bulla and Senator Simpson
strongly favored retaining the clause in
the bill, but it was eliminated by a vote
of 10 to 6. Senator Simpson gave notice
that he would make a motion to recon
sider the vote and it was then advanced
to third reading.
RICHARD'S ELECTION
BILL DOCTORED UP
Not Enough Left of the Original
to Give Its Owner a
Claim.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. I.â Not enough is left of
Assemblyman Rickard's general election
law bill for its author to identify. The
combined Election Law Committees of the
Assembly and Senate got to work on it
this afternoon and after an hour's clever
surgical work pared it down to a fair
resemblance to the Australian ballot sys
tem, and in its reduced state it may
eventually be reported back as a part of
an omnibus election law bill that is at
present contemplated.
Rlckard's original bill was decidedly a
unique effort in the line of law-making.
In a number of its clauses it was not
radically different from the present law;
it made the usual requirements of the
voter as to age and citizenship, but re
quired nothing more of him. It outlined
nothing unusual in the way of registra
tion. It provided for precinct books with
the names and registration affidavits of
voters catalogued and ready for public
inspection twenty days before election,
ana it required that no matter when the
sun rose or set the ballot box should be
opened at 6 in the morning and close at
5 In the afternoon.
These things were all right enough, but
the bill attempted innovations, and it was
at the innovations that the committee
balked. It was assisted in its objections
by Carl Spelling, Max Popper, Dan
Leary and William Hinton. who snoozed
through a term as Registrar of the city
and county of San Francisco, and other
purists. The first exception taken was to
Mr. Rickard's plan of designating on bal-,
lots the party affiliation of nominees and
to inaugurate the system of branding
each party with some insignia or artistic
emblem. Specifically this clause was as
follows:
"When a party nomination is made by
a State convention of a' candidate or can
didates to be voted for by the electors of
the entire State it shall* be the duty of
such convention to select some simple
device or emblem to designate and dis
tinguish the candidate's political party
making such nomination or nominations.
Such device or emblem shall be shown by
a representation thereof upon a certificate
signed and duly executed by the chair
man and secretary of said convention,
which certificate shall be tiled with the
Secretary of State, and such device or
emblem, when so filed, shall in no case be
used by any other party or independent
body. When an independent body shall
make a like nomination, as provided by
section 1188, it shall be the duty of the.
person who shall sign and execute the
certificate of nomination of such candi
date or candidates to likewise select some
simple device or emblem to designate and
distinguish the candidate of such inde
pendent body making such nomination "
One party might not use the emblem
of another, and in cases of independent
nominations the independent candidate
was required to have a little party em
blem of his own which no one else" could
use. Three thousand words were given
over t6 the regulation of that important
matter, and after reading it through and
discussing it the combined committees
ordered it cut out in its entirety
T . n ? second objection was to the' change
which Rlokard's plan would effect in the
ballot itself. He required that the Sec
retary of State should decide upon some
design, which would be water-marked in
the paper upon which the ballots were to
be printed, the design to be kept secret
until the day of election. The ballots
were to be of a size sufficient to accom
modate the names of party nominees and
Independent bodies, and a blank column
in which voters might write the name
of any choice not printed on the ticket
At the head of v..c party columns was to
appear the party device spoken of and
also a circle in which the voter should
stamp one cross if he wished to vote the
straight party ticket.
It was the ticket system to which the
greatest objection was made by those who
appeared before the committee this af
ternoon, and after a good .deal of argu
ment a vote was taken <>n both clauses
and they were ordered stricken out ov a
vote of 6 to 2.
The bill was referred to a special com
mittee of threp members, to which As
semblymen Bolshaw and Rickard and
Senator Stratton were appointed They
will put the bill through the necessary
revision and send it back to the commit
tee to become a part of the omnibus will
that is projected, or go before the Senate
and Assembly as amended.
DIBBLE HITS AT
POLITICAL ADVERTISING
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 1.-Assemblyman Dibble
stated this evening at the meeting of the
Assembly Judiciary Committee that he
would not only vote for any purity of
election law that would include the mak
ing it a felony for- any newspaper to
solicit advertisements from candidates for
office at the time of election, but would
stand on the floor of the Assembly and
advocate it. and if such a bill did not
come before the Assembly he would form
ulate one. He denounced the practice in
good round terms.
The matter came before the committee
through a bill introduced by Caminetti
which condemns the practice of candi
dates for office treating, buying or giving
cigars, intoxicating liquors or temperance
drinks to any person at the time of elec
tion, and provides for a punishment of
the same. When the matter came up As
semblyman Dibble was very effusive in
his arguments in favor of having it
amended so as to include newspaper peo
ple also in regard to soliciting advertise
ments, t'aminetti immediately arose to
his fret and stated that if such a clause
was included It would certainly kill his
bill, and asked that it be not included.
The committee reported favorably upon
the bill without Dibble's amendment.
Bill 340 was also taken up and reported

and to repeal an act making an appro
priation to reimburse the university for

SHORTRIDGE TALKS FOR
PURITY IN HOMES
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. I.â Senator Shortridge of
Santa Clara to-day again came to the
forefront and center as an orator. His
concurrent resolution in reference to
polygamy was adopted by an almost
unanimous vote, after the Senator had
made an appeal for the purity of the
homee of the land. The resolution was
as follows:
Whereas, One Brigham H. Roberts has been
chosen by the voters of L'tah as a member of
the House of Representatives; and whereas,
Brigham H. Roberts has been convicted and
sentenced to prison for the crime of unlawful
cohabitation, and is notoriously living: in a
state of polysamy in defiance of the moral
sense of the nation: and whereas, Brigham H.
Roberts in his practices is but representative
of the principles of the Mormon hierarchy,
and his reception by Congress will be taken as
an evidence that the assaults of the Mormon
hierarchy on the basic principle of the family
life of the nation are received with toleration,
if not with approval; now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate, the Assembly, con-
currlng, That we urge the House of Represen
tatives to deny participation In its counsels to
Brlgham H. Roberts; and further be it
Resolved, That we request Congress to sub
mit to the Legislatures of the several States
an amendment to the constitution forblddinp
polygamy within the United States, or in any
place subject to their jurisdiction, and making
a polygamfst Ineligible to public office.
HOW NEW COUNTIES
MAY BE CREATED
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. I.â Previous to the Legis
lature of 1893 nothing was easier in the
way of enactment than the creation of a
new county. All that was necessary was
the introduction of a bill, little lobbying,
and the trick was done. In 1893 the Legis
lature prepared and submitted to the peo
ple, who adopted it, a constitutional
amendment, which provided that the
Legislature should enact a general law to
govern the creation of new counties. The
amendment was adopted, but the Legis
lature never made any law, and since that
time there has been no way by which
county troubles could be settled.
Burnett of San Luis Obispo County in
troduced a bill which is designed to fill
the long felt want. It provides that coun
ties may from time to lime be formed
from parts of other counties provided that
in so doing.no county is reduced to less
than a population of 8000 or that any
county shall be created having less than
5000 population.
In order to create a new county, a peti
tion signed by 50 per cent of the qualified
electors of any district wishing to sepa
rate itself shall be laid before the Board
of Supervisors. The petition shall be ac
companied by a bond of $3000 to guarantee
the payment of all expenses of the elec
tion which shall be necessary to effect the
disunion.
The bill was referred to the Committee
on Counties and County Boundaries. The
same bill was introduced in the Senate
to-day by Senator Trout.

MAKING GAME OF
NEWSPAPER MEN
A Little Fan Being Poked at
Morehouse's Homicide
Bill.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. I.â When the bill intro
duced in the Senate by the distin
guished representative from Santa
Clara County which defines the crime
of homicide comes up on second read
ing it will be the subject of .consid
erable debate. There will be several
amendments proposed by various Sen
ators to the proposition which is em
bodied in the bill that newspaper em
ployes, editors and reporters shall at
any and all times be recipients of any
ball,. bullet or knife which an aggrieved
person imagines .he ought to put into
their bodies. The bill also specifically
defines such an act as justifiable homi
cide.
To be brief, this paragraph or sec
tion in Senator Morehouse's bill simply
authorizes any exposed fraud, faker or
confidence operator, no matter in what
walk of life he may be operating, to
kill a newspaper man who exposes him
and thereby protects the public. He
will not, for so doing, be held amenable
to the laws.
When the bill comes up in the Senate
Senator Stratton of Alameda has an
amendment to propose that will have
a material bearing upon the bill. His
amendment will propose a closed sea
son, during which the killing of news
paper men is not authorized. This
closed season will be from August 1 to
August 121 of each year. In defense of
his amendment, Senator Stratton will
claim that there is a closed season for
all game, during which the particular
fowl or animal covered by the law is
given immunity from the hunter in or
der that during the breediner season
there will not be a useless slaughter,
and thereby the particular fowl or an
imal will be permitted to propagate the
species. Without some protection, Sen
ator Stratton believes that the news
paper men might become extinct, and
it is his opinion that they are entitled
to the ordinary protection given to
game of various kinds by the law.
It is also understood that Senator
Braunhart will propose an amendment
which will prescribe that all killing of
newspaper men, in order to be legal,
shall be done with the weapon of the
ordinary suicide â a Smith & Wesson
of 38 caliber.
It is mutually agreed by a number
of Senators that an amendment shall
be added to the bill fixing the distance
at which the murder of a newspaper
man shall be justifiable at not less than
ten paces nor more than fifty. The ob
jection of maximum limit Is to prevent
the use of cannon or long-range guns.

HOCHHEIMER ANXIOUS
FOR A NEW ELECTION
One of Burns' Touts Wants to
Succeed Senator Boggs
at Once
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. I.â A. Hochheimer of Wil
lows, who was defeated for the State
Senate at the last general election by
John Boggs, is in this city endeavoring to
get Governor Gage to issue a proclama
tion at once calling for a special election
in his Senatorial district to fill the Boggs
vacancy. Mr. Hochheimer is a well-known
Burns tout, and has been here for sev
eral days advocating the cause of the
"colonel."
Hochheimer is the man who roared to
the State Central Committee that Henry
T. Gage's refusal to address the multitude
at Willows cost the party a great num
ber of votes in Glenn County, He wanted
the candidate for Governor to address a
howling mob in order to help the legisla
tive ticket. Now he wants the Governor
to get in at once with a proclamation
calling for a special election.
The calling of an election in the Eighth
Senatorial District might be the best
thing that could happen at this time. The
people of Mendocino, Colusa and Glenn
counties will know at the outset that
Hochheimer is a Burns man, that he will
vote for Burns for Senator arid take his
orders on all other matters from the
"organization." The people of the district
may say "Let the proclamation issue ti?at
we may have an opportunity to express
our sentiments on the Senatorial contest. "
To-day Senator Dickinson, prompted
by Jake Steppacher, introduced a resolu
tion directing that the Governor be of
ficially informed of the death of Senator
Boggs. The inference is clear that the
"organization" wants a special election to
nil the Boggs vacancy.
In speaking of the matter Mr. Hoch
heimer said: "I will not make a hard
fight for the office, as 1 did in my en
deavor for election against Mr. Boggs,
but I have made a canvass among my
friends and I feel assured of my suc
cess. If I find that my election will be
easy, why 1 am a candidate for the. of
fice, but as far as making a hard fight
is concerned, I will not try. Mr. Boggs
defeated me by but a small majority and j
In all the counties in the district I ran
considerably ahead of my ticket, and as
many of my friends voted for Mr. Boggs
on party principles, I can depend upon
them to assist me in this endeavor. I |
know of no other candidate In the field j
against me at present, so expect little
opposition, though if I find there is much
opposition I shall be temoted to drop I
out. As this session will be practically
ended before I could be seated and as !
there will be no other United States Sena
tor to elect, I expect my Democratic !
friends to vote for me, as there will be j
no party principles -involved."
In this connection some doubt is ex- |
pressed whether or not, under the pro- j
visions of the Australian ballot law. an ,
election could be held in time to permit
of the successful candidate taking part
in the proceedings of the present session. '
If the election could not be held in timp
to permit of the Senator elected taking
his seat before the end of this session, it |
is probable that the expense and trouble
Of holding a special election will be dis- j
pensed with and no election will be held
until the general election in 1900.
Section 1053 of the Political Code pro
vides that in case of special elections to :
fill vacancies in the office of State Senator
the Governor shall Issue a proclamation ;
at least ten days before such election is
held. This proclamation is sent to the
Board of Supervisors of the county or !
counties Included in the Senatorial dis- j
trict. who shall publish .the same for a j
period of not less than five days. This
was ' the law under the old election sys
tem, and the practice was to hold such ;
special election forthwith; but under the ;
Australian ballot law all names to be ;
placed upon the ballot used at an election
must be those of candidates nominated ,
cither by a regularly organized convr-n- \
tion or by petition, which nomination i
must be certified, in cases of State Sena
tors, to the County Clerk of the county
in which the district is located, or, |
if there is more than one county in the i
Senatorial district, then to the Clerk of
the county in which the candidate resides.
This certificate of nomination shall be
filed not more than fifty days nor less
than thirty days before the day of elec
tion, where the nomination is made by a
convention, and not more than fifty days
nor less than twenty days before the day
of election where the nomination is mailo
by petition, and under section 1196 ballots
prepared in any other manner shall not
be used or counted at any election.
In this case, then, should the most ex
peditious method be adopted and the can- ;
didates nominated by petition, the proc
lam&tion calling for the election would
have to fix the date of holding it at a suf
ficiently late day to give the candidates
time to prepare their petitions and file
them tw-enty days before the cmte fixed.
Assuming ttiat it would take at leas.t
ten days to have the proclamation issued
and prepare such petitions and certifi
cates of nomination, the twenty days ad
ditional required to elapse after the
filing of the certificate would fix the date
of election at least thirty days from now,
which would be at the end of this session.

CLERKSHIP DECLINED
WITHOUT THANKS
The Minority Enlivens the Ron
tine of the Proceedings of
the Assembly.
CALL HEADQfUARTERb. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. I.â Assemblyman Devoto
of San Francisco and the majority rather
mixed things in the Assembly this morn
ing with Mr. Mead of Los Angeles and
the minority. It was over a question of
minority patronage raised by a member
of the majority, and before Devoto had
got through with it he was firmly of the
opinion that his colleagues had handed
him a gold brick when they conferred
upon him the honor of offering a clerk
ship at $5 per day to the Democratic mem
bers.
The minority caucused two weeks and
more ago on the patronage .proposition
and decided that they would vote for no
amendment or repeal of the Belshaw act,
and that they would not vote to seat any
further employes by resolution. They
further decided that if the majority
should vote to do either and should offer
the minority any of the accruing patron
age it should be declined.
This morning I>evoto in a neat speech
offered a resolution in the Assembly
proffering the minority a clerkship at a
salary of $5. Mead got up from his seat
in a white heat and without thanks or
any other token of courtesy declined it.
He Bald the majority knew well enough
the principle the minority had decided to
follow with regard to patronage, and he
branded the resolution as an attempt to
make it appear that the Democrats'
reason for refusing to vote against the
Belshaw bill was not so much a matter of
principle as a matter of pure envy, and
on behalf of his fellow-Democrats he de
nied that this was so. He also declined
to accept the proffered clerkship.
The majority, however, stuck to the
proposition, and referred the resolution to
the Committee on Attaches.
When the Assembly opened this morn
ing it took just time enough to call tne
roll and then took an hour's recess upon
the motion of Dibble, who read a tele
gram saying that the funeral of the late
Senator Boggs of Colusa was to take place
between 10:45 and 11 o'clock. The motion
to suspend business out of respect to tne
<Ureased Senator was adopted unani
mously.
When order was called again the junk
eting committee that was sent to inspect
the State insane asylum at Napa offered
its report through the chairman. Owen
Wade. Everything at the institution was
found in the best condition, and the ad
ministration was highly complimented. It
was also suggested that the asylum is
badly in need of the water supply to pro
vide which a bill has been already intro
duced in the Assembly. The expense of
the trip, which was allowed by resolu
tion, amounted to $85 40.
Immediately upon the adoption of the
report Speaker Anderson announced his
resignation from the following commit
tees: As chairman of the Corporations
Committee and as a member of the Com
mittee on Dairies and Dairy Products.
Fish and Game. Public Health and Quar
antine and Public Morals. He announced
the appointment of Assemblyman Raub
of Sutter as chairman of the Committee
on Corporations, and Of Howard Wright,
the deposed Speaker, as a member of the
Corporations. Fish and Game. Dairy and
Dairy Products committees. Assembly
man Marvin he appointed to the Health
and Quarantine Committee.
Assemblyman Dibble offered the patron
age resolution decided upon yesterday in
caucus. There were two slight changes
from the list published this morning. The
name of B. F. Frazer had been substi
tuted for that of Miss Ella McKeen. and
that of Frank Storror for that of R. P.
Russell. They were both committee clerk
ships. Leave of absence was granted by
resolution to the Committee on Commerce
and Navigation so that it may visit San
Francisco and Oakland on Friday, Sat
urday and Sunday for the purpose of in
vestigating the needs of the water fronts

0 NEW YORK, Feb. I.â Rev. Â»George H. Simons, of Brooklyn, pre- 8
<TJ dieted his own death, which occurred yesterday at midnight of pneu- Q
monia. Last December, during a heavy snowstorm, he visited a sick $

Dr. Simons, who was pastor of the Wikoff-Street M. E. Church, had Z.

CHINESE PERISH
IN BURNING HUTS
Made Stupid by Opium, the Celestials
Do Not Attempt to
Escape.
VANCOUVER, B. C. Feb. 1.-China
town, at the big <'h<-mainus Lumber Mills
nÂ»-ar Nanaim<>. the ( .-oal center of the
province, was almost completely <I>--
Btroyed by fir. yesterday and a number of
â tiais were burned in death. News
of disaster reached ihis city late *ls
afternoon. The conflagration was acconi-
panied by Incidents of an extraordinary
nature. The big lumber mills art now
running night and day. The nigln men
had just quit work and repaired to their
numerous shacks when the fire com-
nvnced.
It appears that the Celestials, on reach-
Ing their town, were chilled and wet
through. They, built several large bon
flrt-.s near th<- shacks to dry their clothes
and then turned in to rest. The inevita
ble opium plpf was indulged in until the
Chinese were oblivious of their surrouii.l
ings. The day shift had left for the mills
some distance away, and no onÂ« was left
to watch the bonfires, vinlch blazed
fiercely dangerously close to the dwell
ings. A brisk breeze sprang up and drove
the flames right on to the snacks, and in
]<ss time than it takes to tell, the whole
Settlement was in flames.
The day workers speedily went to the
r'scue. Smashing in door after dodr
thoy were confronted by their half-stuptd
countrymen, who apparently had no de-
Blre to escape. Some were carried out of
the burning buildings, but others leas for
tunate slept their deen Hleep while the
feeling was expressed as various ru
mors of underhand work were dis
cussed.
The cause of the failure has assumed
the nature of a dispute between those
most interested, the bank officials and
E. B. Howard, fruit shipper. The bank
people claim Howard brought on the
difficulty by overdrawing his account
and by having his drafts protested after
liberal advances had been made to him.
This Howard denies. He admits being
indebted to the institution in the neigh
borhood of $100,000, but says the bank
never protested any of his paper. How
ard says none of the fruit he is hand
ling is held as security by the bank.
He intimates he is being "crucified,"
and points to the fact that just before
T. R. Weaver attached him for $2000
Weaver knew the bank was to fail and
drew $2900 from the bank. Weaver at
tached about twenty carloads of fruit
and Howard's home.
The Union Savings Bank has always
been regarded as a "'good thing" by
people in want of funds, and it is to
this liberality that it owes its entangle
ment. Merchants. orchardists and
struggling professional men could al
ways go there and get money on their
notes. It is said that a large part of
$553,112 loaned on personal securities is
almost worthless. It is this liberality
of the bank officials that is being con
demned by the people.
Authoritative news in connection
with the bank failure was scarce to
day. Bank Commissioners A. W. Bar
rett and John Markley, accompanied
by Secretary C. H. Dunemoor, arrived
this afternoon and, assumed charge of
affairs. Work was at once commenced
on books and papers. Aside from say
ing the books appeared in good shape
and the condition of the institution

flames crackled and roared around them
The flimsy shacks burned fiercely and
soon they were a mass of smoking ruins
It was then ascertained that at least two
Chinese burned to death. A number of
others were badly burned, and it was re

missing.
The scene was one of thp wildest ex
cftcment for a time. Very little damage
was done to the surrounding property
Tho injured Chinese, who were taken to

trymen, who refused to let them go to a

of the Secretary of War Captain William

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1899.
gentlemen parted with no information.
They will not report for some days, and
until then nothing definite will be
known.
The directors of the bank held a
meeting, but nothing was done, an ad
journment being taken until to-morrow
afternoon. At that time a business
course will be decided upon. Some of
the directors favor the bank going into
liquidation, while others think affairs
can be straightened out by levying an
assessment. President Wright said to
day an assessment of $10 or ?15 a share
would relieve the situation, as many of
the real estate securities are first class
and can easily be be turned into cash.
About half of the stockholders can
stand this, and it probably will be done.
The only questionable transaction in
connection with the bank failure is the
filing of a deed to the bank premises
on First and Fountain streets, convey
ing the property to Myra E. Wright,
the wife of William H. Wright, vice
president of the institution. The deed
is absolute, but President Ward Wright
. claims it is understood to be only a
mortgage. Although the transfer was
made Tast June the semi-annual state
ments in July and January showed the
property among available assets at
$95,000. Myra E. Wright advanced $60,
--000 on the premises and the. directors
claim about $35,000 of this amount has
been repaid. This deed was â¢ given
simply to secure the money and was
never intended to be recorded. As soon
as the bank refused to transact busi
ness yesterday Mrs. Wright, at the re
quest of F. V. Wright, filed the deed.
W. H. Wright is in the East, and had
he been at home it is claimed this would
not have occurred.
The tiling of the assignment of mort
gage given by L. A. Spitzer and wife
to the Union Savings Bank for $2500
by the Union Trust Company of San
Francisco is another mistake arlsine
out of the failure. The Soitzer mort
gage was satisfied last November and
so acknowledged by the Union Bank
officials. The assignment, however
had never been returned to the local
bank officials, and when news of the
failure became known the Union Trust
Company rushed it into the records.
An assignment was filed by I. W. Hell
man to-day of a mortgage executed by
J. W. Cunningham and wife to the
Union Savings Bank for $10,175. The
date of tne assignment is January 18
last.
There are about 1800 persons repre
sented in the $791,975 due- depositors.
Of these about 1550 are in the savings
department and their average deposit
is $254. They may have to wait some
time for their money.
Among the creditors of the institution
are many fruit men and orchardists,
who for the past three or four years
have been helped along. The bank did
a big business among these people.
During the financial panic a few years
ago it stood by this class of creditors
when other banks refused loans and
consequently it had many friends. Much
of the bank's securities are in the shape
of stoned fruit and fruit contracts.
Dealing with fruit men led the bank
into relations with Howard. Those who
know claim Howard is interested in
about $250,000 worth of fruit in Santa
Clara County. He is heavily involved.
The dumping of this amount of fruit on
the market at this time of year would
be disastrous to fruit men and caus'> a
fearful slump in prices. This would do
more injury to the business of Santa
Clara County than a half-dozen failures
like that of the Union Savings Bank.
A syndicate is now being organized
to avert this and handle the fruit, and
when it is completed Howard will as-
sign to it. Of Howard's $100,000 in
debtedness to the bank. President
Wright says two-thirds of it is secured
by fruit. If Howard was forced into
insolvency this security would shrink
to almost nothing, but now that a syn
dicate will handle Howard's business it
has been improved materially.
At the first of the year there was a
change in the Board of Directors of the
Union Savings Bank, but, contrary to
rumor, this had nothing to do with the
embarrassment. L. M. Hale retired on
account of ill health, and Henry Ed
wards because of other business. In
their stead Antone Friant and N. Bow
den were selected.

ATLANTIC LINER
RHYNLAND ASHORE
Driven Upon the Beach During the
Gale Off the Delaware
Coast.
PHILADELPHIA. Feb. I.â The trans
atlantic liner Rhynland, Captain Hannah,
from Liverpool for this port, went ashore
on Cotton Patch Shoal, about four miles
north of Fenwicks Island Life Saving
station, during last night's storm. At a
Vate hour to-night she was still stranded,
but lay in an easy position, and it is hoped
to get her off with the next high tide.
The tug North America went to her as
sistance this morning and succeeded in
moving her a short distance. Later in
the day the tug went to Delaware Break
water and brought back the lighter Ix>t
tie. Part of the steamer's cargo will be
taken off, and when this Is done she will
be floated. The steamer's propeller is
broken and it is thought her rudder has
been carried away. There are forty-two
passengers and a crew of seventy-nine
men on board and all are well.
Fenwicks Island light is about twenty
five miles below the breakwater, which
would indicate that the Rhynland was a
few miles out of her course when she
grounded. This is accounted for by the
condition of the weather at the time.
A dense snow storm was prevailing and
the island light could not be seen.

BIG PROFITS FOR FARMERS
REPORT OF THE STATE BOARD
OF AGRICULTURE.
â 
Attention of Congress Is Directed to
the Urgent Need of a General
System of Irrigation
for Ihis State.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. I.â The annual
meeting o-f the State Board of Agri
culture was held this afternoon, but
owing to the absence of several mem
bers very little business was transacted.
Resolutions were adopted expressive of
the board's respect for Directors Chase
and Boggs, whose deaths occurred since
the last meeting. The board approved
the annual report as prepared by Secre
tary Edwin F. Smith, to be presented
to Governor Gage.
The resolutions in respect to the death
of Director Charles M. Chase refer to
his twenty years' service as a member
of the board and speak of him as a
public-spirited citizen, ever ready to
advance the interests of his adopted
State, and one whose character was a
standard for the emulation of his fel
lows. Speaking of Director Boggs the
resolutions recognize that in his death
the State has been deprived of one of its
pioneer and foremost citizens, whose
early occupation in this State blazed
the way for the successful workers that
have followed. The resolutions charac
terize the deceased member as a man
who was alive to progress and favored
improved methods in every line of his
extensive enterprises.
The annual report of the board to the
Governor deals with the abnormal
climatic conditions which existed dur
ing the year 1898; refers to the impro
vision of methods for irrigating lands
and for the purpose of saving stock.
The business of the State, however, is
declared not to have suffered as much
as it would have under similar condi
tions ten years ago^ inasmuch as other
productive industries and trades have
advanced to such an extent that Cali
fornia is not wholly dependent upon
grain growing, as in former years.
The total wheat yield for the past
year as figured at the office of the
agricultural society was 12,480,088
bushels, which was a much larger
amount than was expected at the close
of harvest. The largest and best yield
is declared to have come from the river
lands and upper part of the Sacramento
Valley.
The report refers to the attention
Congress is giving to the question of
irrigation, and adds:
It should be plain to every soil producer
of California with the experiences of the
season just closed that a general system
of irrigation Is wanted and which would
be of Incalculable value to our agricul
tural resources, thereby Insuring an an
nual output and reducing to a minimum
the chances of crop failures that appear
periodically through lack of moisture.
The idea Is to our mind most practicable
and should be pushed to completion with
out delay. There is at the present time
more idle capital available for permanent
investment than for many years past, ow
ing to the absence of large enterprises
for its employment.
The report expresses the belief that
the beet sugar industry will eventually
make California prosperous in all sec
tions. The report says:
Land adapted to sugar beet growing
will average fourteen or. fifteen tons to
the acre, from which the farmer will
realize about $60. The cost varies with
varying conditions and location, but will
in general range from $30 to $40 an acre.
The farmer will thus net $20 to $30 per
acre on his season's crop.
The above is figured on a basis of $4 a
ton, which was the fixed price for the
season of 1898. With an increase of 50
cents per ton, the contract price for the
coming season, the outlook is extremely
bright for the beet raiser.
The report calls upon the Legislature
to aid in the development of the good
road idea in this State. Mention is
made of the cattle and sheep interests,
and figures are given relative to the
fruit crop. The establishment of a tree
market in San Francisco for the dispo
sition of the soil products of the State
is indorsed.
Of the State fair, the report remarks
that it well serves a purpose, and could
not be substituted by any other plan
of a public nature for advertising the
possibilities of the state.
The financial statement of the board
shows that the total indebtedness of
the society at this date is $25,505 13.
During the year past the indebtedness
was reduced $2,593 96 by the practice
of economy, and the board believes that
in two years the present indebtedness
practically will have been wined out.
The Board of Agriculture has under
way the disposal of the agricultural
park property in this city, the proceeds
to be devoted to the purchase of a new
site. Recently a citizen of Sacramento
filed a suit to reauire the board to re
invest the sale proceeds in this county.
Peter J. Shields, the secretary, who will
assume office next spring, has received
a letter from President A. B. Snreckels,
in which he says that personally he fa
vors the contention of the citizen bring
ing the suit. Director J. W. Wilson
said to The Call correspondent to-night
that every member of the board was in
favor of relocating the Agricultural
Park in Sacramento.
CLARK'S PLEDGE TO
THE REPUBLICANS
DENVER. Feb. 1. â A special to the
News from Helena, Mont., says: In re
sponse to published criticisms of the
course of the Republican members of the
State Legislature in voting for W. A.
Clark for United States Senator. Senator
Hobson of Fergus County to day issued
a statement denning his position, which
divulged a hitherto unpublished and in
teresting matter of detail concerning the
condition of the support of Clark. The
interesting part of Mr. Hobson's state
ment, which is a lengthy one, is:
At the time Mr. Clark had shown his full
Democratic strength, it became apparent that
he could not be elected without Republican
votes and as the Democratic followtng was
about to leave him and name another candi
date who was much more objectionable, the
Republicans secured a written pledge from Mr.
Clark that he would, if elected, vote for a high
protective tariff and refuse to be bound by
any caucus to do otherwise.
Fine Outlook for Crops.
WOODLAND, Feb. I.â The crop pros- .
pects for the lands along the Sacramento |
River from Knights Landing to Sycamore j
are very good this season. The rainfall !
has been generous for that section of the
State, there does not seem to be any pres
ent danger of an overflow, and the farm
ers are rushing the work of seeding the
land with a view of getting in as large an
area as possible. The water in Sycamore
slough recently ran over the banks and
overflowed about 500 acres of land between
the Miller and Curtiss places. The water
is now rapidly receding. On the Sutter
side an unusual amount of land will be
sown to alfalfa this year, as the farmers
believe it will be more profitable to raise
hay than wheat.
CONGRESS WILL PUT
THE PRESIDENT ON
RECORD AT ONCE
CompelliQg a Declaration of His
iQtentions With Regard to the
Indepeodence of tfye
PhilippiQes.
NEW YORK, Feb. I.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald sends the following: President McKinley may be forced to go on
record for or against the independence of the Philippines before his
policy commission has had a chance to report. Developments today
make it practically certain that the Senate -will pass the Sullivan res
olution, which, while vague in terms, nominally promises independ
ence to the Philippines. This resolution, although originally Intend
ed to declare simply the sense of the Senate, was to-day offered as a
substitute for the Bacon resolution, with the title of the latter re
tained, thus making it a joint resolution, which will require the sanc
tion of the House. Should it be passed by both houses, as now seems
probable, the President will be forced to approve or disapprove it.
He can, of course, allow it to become a law without his signature,
but the effect would be the. same as approval.
It can be authoritatively stated that the President is personally
opposed to any declaratory resolution at this time touching future
policy toward the Philippines. He wants a report from his .policy
commission before anything in this direction is done. But leading Re
publicans in the Senate have deemed ft expedient to permit a vote to
be taken, believing the adoption of the Sullivan resolution will not do
any harm, while it will be of immediate benefit in removing all obsta
cles to the ratification of the Paris treaty.
But for the objection of Senator Carter, who ostensibly desired
that Senator Spooner, temporarily absent, should be allowed to speak
to-morrow, a vote on the Sullivan resolution would have been taken
to-day. It will be voted upon to-morrow, as Senator Carter announced
to-night that he will withdraw his objection. In all probability It will
be adopted. I understand that the majority of the Committee on
Foreign Relations will vote for it.

TREATY TALKS BY SENATORS
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1. â Senators
Teller and Hoar were the speakers in
the executive session ot the Senate to
day. Mr. Teller made a set speech in
support of the treaty and Mr. Hoar re
plied. Both went over much ground
that had been covered before, but some
new points were brought out.
Mr. Teller devoted special attention to
the capabilities of the Filipinos for self-
j government. He contended that they
I had not yet reached the stage where
they could be considered, capable of
taking care of themselves, and he based
I much of his argument upon the inca-
I paoity demonstrated by their leader,
! Aguinaldo. He read extracts from the
I Philippine leader's proclamation, con
j tending that they demonstrated beyond
j question that he was Ignorant of the
! first principles of popular government,
especially a democratic form of govern
ment. He referred to the fact that the
Filipino leader had in some of his pro
nuneiamentos spoken as a dictator,
which the Colorado Senator said did
| not accord with the professions of de
i mocracy made for him. Mr. Teller also
referred to the general situation in the
Orient, enlarging upon the necessity for
the United States to hold a footing
I which had been secured through what
| almost must be regarded as providen
tial means. He dwelt upon the reports
of vast coal deposits in the Philippines,
and said they were invaluable on this
account to any nation, for, in the fu
ture, the country which controlled the
coal deposits of the world would domi
nate the other nations, both from a
commercial and military point of view,
i At the present time the United States,
i Great Britain and Japan control the
i principal coal supplies, and he predicted
that so long as they continued to con
trol them and were friendly to one an
other they would hold the reins of
power. Other European nations appre
i ciate the importance of the coal supply,
and this fact, more than any other, ac
counted for the desire of Russia and
Germany to get a foothold in the Phil
ippines. Russia was, he said, especially
grasping, and it behooved this country
to be on its guard against the encroach
ments of that power.
In conclusion Mr. Teller referred to
his antagonism to the administration,
saying that he expected to oppose the
party in power in the next campaign,
but strongly as he felt on the questions
which separated him from that party,
he was, nevertheless, willing to sink
party questions and subordinate parti
san advantage to what he believed to
be a much broader view â a patriotic
rather than a partisan view.
Rising to reply, Mr. Hoar said that
there could be no doubt of Mr. Teller's
attitude toward the Republican party
after his anxiety to have the treaty
ratified had been made so evident, for
he could not possibly do anything that
would go further toward encompassing
the disorganization and defeat of the
Republican party than to make certain
the ratification of the pending treaty.
Mr. Hoar devoted the greater part of
his reply to a defense of Aguinaldo,
whom he compared to Simon Bolivar,
the South American patriot. It would
be remembered, he said, that Bolivar
also had, upon occasion, taken
upon himself the title of dictator, and
yet who, on this account, should ac
cuse the Bolivian liberator of being
false to his people or to their aspira
tions for freedom?
Aguinaldo had so far been a shrewd
and able leader, and he had not by
any act of his shown himself to be in
capable of the highest degree of lead
ership.
During the course of his remarks
Senator Hoar said the argument had
been advanced that the United States
should be near at hand to participate
in the predicted partition of China, and
proceeded to say that this argument
indicated a disposition to grasp even
more territory than had yet been taken.
Such a policy, he thought, should be
nipped in the bud, as he was very con
fident the people of the United States
would not profit by joining the Euro
pean powers in their efforts to distrib
ute among themselves the possessions
of this ancient empire.
This last remark brought Senator
Davis to his feet. While his name had
not been mentioned, it was evident that
Mr. Hoar alluded to a remark of the
Minnesota Senator. The latter said he
had not adverted to any participation
by the United States in the process of
dismemberment, but that he had only
alluded to its probability and had said
merely that the United States should
be on hand to protect their own in
terests.
HOUSE PROCEEDINGS.
Hepburn of lowa Attacks the Biver
and Harbor Bill.
WASHINGTON. Feb. I.â The House en
tered upon the consideration of the river
and harbor bill to-day and made rapid
progress. Fifty of the eighty-eight
pages had been completed when the
House adjourned. The bill appropriates
directly about $12,500.0000 and authorizes
contracts to the extent of $18,000,000 addi
tional. The general debate was unusual
ly brief. Its feature was a speech in op
f'osition to the bill by Mr: Hepburn of
owa. who has fought every river and
harbor bill for the last six years.
WASHINGTON, Feb. I.â For a few
minutes in the Senate this afternoon It
seemed likely that a vote might be
taken on one or more of the pending
resolutions relating to expansion. An
unusually large attendance of Republi
can Senators was in attendance, all of
them having been notified to be pres
ent, in the event of a critical vote on
the pending question. Mr. Bacon of
Georgia had called up his resolutions,
and Mr. Chandler of New Hampshire
had withdrawn his motion to refer
them to the Committee on Foreign Re
lations.
Mr. Sullivan of Mississippi had en
tered a motion to substitute his reso
lutions for those of Mr. Bacon, while
Mr. Davis, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, had announced
that he was willing that a vote should
be taken immediately. As it was evi
dent, however, that a vote on the reso
lutions and amendments could not be
taken before 2 o'clock â the hour fixed
by unanimous consent for the Senate
to go into executive session â Mr. Bacon
asked for unanimous consent that a
vote be taken at 12:30 to-morrow. To
this request Mr. Carter of Montana ob
jected, and the whole question was left
suspended.
Mr. Rawlins of Utah addressed the
Senate upon the Vest anti-expansion
resolution.
Referring to the contention of Lodge
and other Senators that the labor prod
uct of the Filipinos would not be per
mitted to come into competition with
American labor and its product Mr.
Rav.iins pointed out that if Congress
possessed this authority it could im
pose duties which would prevent the
wheat grown in Oklahoma from com
peting with that grown in Kansas or
other States of the Union; or the min
erals produced in New Mexico and Ari
zona from competing with the like
products of Colorado and Utah. He
maintained that if the inhabitants of
the Philippine archipelago may be de
nied the liberty of locomotion, not as
a punishment for any crime of which
they may have been duly convicted, if
they may be lawfully forbidden to come
to America, then we may deny them the
right of passing from one island to an
other or from visiting their neighbor's
house, and if we may do this we may
throw them into Spanish dungeons,
there to await the incoming tide to end
their troubles and place them beyond
American tyranny. Allusion was made
to the contention that until the treaty
is ratified the truce between the United
States and Spain must continue, and
then Mr. Rawlins said:
"Is it possible that the end of the.
war with Spain, accomplished by the
ratification of the treaty, is to be the
inception of a new war with the in
habitants of those Islands; that we are
to turn our guns from the Spaniards
upon them, although guilty of no crime
except the desire and aspiration to be
free?
"We can retain Subig Bay and suffi
cient, territory around it or some other
suitable place as a military and naval
base, recognize the independence of the
people of the rest of the archipelago,
let them go in peace and give them the |
assurance erf our protection.
"What do we want the Philippines
for? Do we want them to furnish homes
for our own people? No. Do we want
them to furnish an outlet for our sur
plus labor? Do we want them to add |
a wholesome element to our dodulx- I
tion, that our sons may find wives an.i I
our daughters husbands? The blight
ing curse of the Almighty would rest
upon such miscegenation. Do we want !
them in order to practice upon their j
inhabitants the same arts of Dhilan- |
thropy which applied to the aborigi
nal inhabitants of this continent ha\e
led to their extermination? Humanity i
says no. Do we want them in order to '
send thither swarms of office-holders. I
carpet-baggers, to riot among them
like slimy worms, eating out their sub
stance? Ah, there's the rub. But for
this, this perplexing problem I doubt
would to-day be seriously confronting
the American people. No; there ts m j
conceivable good which they can bring
to us. Their retention bodes nothing I
but evil.
"We cannot afford to pro over half
way down to the Asiatic level In order
to proportionately lift their civilization.
We have enacted laws which stand like
cherubim with flaming swords at
the gateways of the republic to drive
back the hordes of the dark and degen
erate races of the east, lest they might
enter into and degrade us. The Sen
ator from Connecticut (Mr. Platt)
twitted the Senator from Massachu
setts (Mr. Hoar) with seeing constitu
tional obstacles, lions in the pathway
leading to the House Beautiful. Would
the Senator from Connecticut have us,
like Samson of old, destroy the lion
at the gate in order that we might en
ter in to wed the daughter of the Phil
istine? It behooves us to take warning
by that example leÃt we. too, by such
'benevolent assimilation,' have our
locks shorn and the strength of our
institutions taken away."

MEMORY FOUND
AFTER LONG YEARS
Marvelous Result of
Brain Surgery.
REASON MAY COME BACK
THE MIND OF A SMALL BOY
DESTROYED.
He Takes Up the Thread of Life
Where It Had Been Broken
Abruptly Many Years
Ago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, 111.. Feb. I.â Eleven year*
ago Charles Burrell of Chebanse. 111.,
while engaged in a childish quarrel
with a playmate, was struck on the left
side of the head with a brick. The mo
ment he was struck he began to run
around in a circle. He was taken to his
home and a physician called, but* the
boy never recovered his reason or his
powers of locomotion. While able to
walk, he was unable to control hia
movements, and had a constant ten
dency to move in a circle.
Some time ago his parents, learning
of an operation by whicn tire reason of
Attorney Frank Collier was restored,
set about to have their son. now 19
years of age, operated upon. In 1896.
believing him to be incurable, they had
taken him to the State Hospital for
the insane at Kankakee. The desires
of the parents were made known to Dr.
Staarns, superintendent of the institu
tion, and on Monday the experiment
was begun. He was placed under the
influence of an X-ray, generated by
1,000,000 volts of t electricity, and a skia
graph of the skull taken. This showed,
a thickening of the bone near the top
of the skull on the left side. To-day an
operation was performed by which the
thickened bone was removed, relieving:
the unnatural pressure upon the brain
at that point. The first words uttered
by the young man, upon recovering:
from the unconsciousness caused by the
anesthetics used during the operation
were :
"What made you hit me?"
The question has been hidden away
in the unfortunate's memory since the
fateful day, eleven years ago, when ho
received the wound, and the boy picked
up the thread of his lffe where it had
been snapped by the careless act of a
playmate.
"There is great improvement," said
Dr. Steams, "and I hope for still bet
ter results. The dementia has gone so
far, however, I am afraid the young
man's brain will never be perfectly
healthy."
The patient spoke thankfully to the

KILLING OF COOK
PLANNED LONG AGO
NAFA; Feb. I.â One fact was in
oontrovertibly proved to-day in
the preliminary examination of
George S. McKenzie, charged
with complicity in the killing of
Alfred fj&ok. This was that the ac
cused and Jesse Walters, who fired the
fatal shot, were on a still hunt for
Cook ever since the first of December
la?t. Mrs. M. Ray of San Francisco,
who kept a lodging-house at 405 Van
Ness avenue, and who is a niece of
Walters, gave testimony on this point,
which was strengthened by other wit
nesses.
Mrs. Ray was the star witness of the
day. She is an elderly lady. Her tes
timony was given with great reluct
ance. She admitted that McKenzie and
Walters went to see her in order to
get her aid in locating Cook in San
Francisco. So far as she knew, she
Bald, Walters wanted to find Cook so
as tn have him arrested fnr alienating
the affections of Mrs. Walters.
Justice Bradford, averse to repeating
the exhibition he made in the Walters
case, induced Justice J. C. Wright of
Callstoga to hold court for him and
preside during the examination of Mc-
Kenzie. and everything ran along
smoothly in consequence. George A.
Knight was unable to appear for Mc-
Kenzie, and Aneon Hilton of San Fran
cisco was added to the list of attorneys
for the defense. The o>urt room held
a larger audience than has been pres
ent at any previous stage of the pro
ceedings. About forty witnesses are to
be examined for the prosecution. Nine
teen of these were on the stand to-day.
The prosecution expects to close to
morrow, and the defense does not In
tend to put <>n' any witnesses in behalf
of the accused.
F. J. Peabody. a photographer of St.
Helena, testified that Walters called on
him on December 3. 1898. and asked for
a photograph Â«f Cook for Sheriff Mc-
Kenzie, saying Cook was wanted in
connection with a forgery case. Attor
ney Beerstecher objected to witness
testifying to anything Walters may
have said regarding McKenzie. To this
Bell replied as follow?:
We propose tn show a conspiracy be
tween Jes?^ Walters and George S. Mc-
Kenzie to kill Alfred Cook. We expect
to show that tins conspiracy dates back
to December 1, I
On further objection by the defense
this witness was temporarily with
drawn.
Fred Jacks, who keeps a bicycle re
pair shop adjoining the McKenzie sta
ble, heard shots from McKenzie's sta
ble at the time of the homicide. Two
shots came rapidly together and others
followed at a greater interval. He
thought three shots followed the first
two, but thero may have been more.

MONTEREY BEET
LAND IN LITIGATION
Long-Drawn-Out Suit Caused by a
Change in the Salinas River
Channel.
SALINAS, Feb. 1.-One of the most im
portant land cae^s ever tried in the courts
of Monterey County is that of E. J. Mo
lera of San Francisco VS. James Martin
of Monterey, now occupying the atten
tion of a jury in the Superior Court. The
litigation wa? caused by the change of
the channel of Salinas River. Every wet
winter the river overflows its banks and
as a rule the river lied is changed. In
1594 this was the case. Thp river changed
its course so materially that many prop
erty-owr.ers whopÂ« land was on the south
side of the stream found themselves on
the north side.
J B. H. Cooper of San Francisco and
James Martin owned property at Moro
Cojo. about seven miles rrom this City.
The river was the boundary line to the
property. After the river changed 116
acres of the Martin land was shifted over
to the other side and adjoining the Mo
lera property. Molera claimed the land
as according" to the survey the river was
the boudary line of his property. Martin
took possession "f the land and Molera
sued to eject. Martin won in the lower
court, but lost on appeal. The <-aFe has
remained in the courts ever since and Ls
now being tried in the Superior Court ol
this county. The property involved is
pome of the hest beet land in the county.
HORRIBLE CASE
OF FRATRICIDE
CHICAGO. Feb. Lâ When Mr?. Michael
Malone of 146 Gladys avenue entered the
room of her husband last night and at
tempted to arouse him Â»he was horrififd
to find that his head was almost severed
from his body. Thomas Malone. brother
of the murdered man. surrendered to the
police to-day and acknowledged that he
had killed his brother. According to his
story Michael threw a stove lid at him
because he, refuged to go for beer, where
upon he felled Michael with a hammer.
The confessed murderer added:
"After he fell I carried him to the bed
and finished hire with a razor. He was
no account anyhowâ always drunk and
fighting with every one. It waa no use
trying to live with him any longer."
ACROMEGALIA CLAIMS
A CHICAGO VICTIM
CHICAGO, Feb. I.â GeorgÂ© Rogers, -who
was known In the vicinity in which he
lived as the "bogie man," died to-day in
the County Hospital of a rare disease,
â which the physicians have called acro
mpgalia. or swelling of the bones. His
hands and feet were greatly swollen, and
hie Jaw was over four times the normal
length. The distance from the frontal
bone to the chin in the ordinary man is
eight to ten Inches, and in Rogers this
*Â»d grown to twenty inches. Although
the last shots and those that preceded.
The first two and the last shot were
noticeably louder than the intermediate
shots. He believed that ten or twelve
seconds elapsed between the first and
last shot.
Miss F. A. Coates, the telegraph op
erator at Napa, testified that on De
cember 1 George S. McKenzie caused
to be telegraphed the following mes
sage, addressed to Jesse Walters, at
Oakville:
Come down on the morning train to
San Francisco to identify man in Grigs
by robbery. I think you know him.
Objection was made by Attorney
Beerstecher to the introduction of this
message, on the ground that It did not
connect McKenzie with the killing of
Cook, and that it related to another
matter entirely. This elicited from Bell
the following statement:
We exepect to follow this up by show
ing that on the following morning George
S. McKensie and Jesse Walters went to
the city of San Francisco for the purpose
of looking for Alfred Cook and that this
message was sent to Jesse Walters; to get
him to go there to look for Alfred Cook.
Although the language is ambiguous it
applies to this case, and we will show by
the admissions of the defendant before
the Coroner's jury that he sent this tele
gram to Jesse Waters for the purpose
of having him go to San Francisco to
look for Alfred Cook. We will thereby
connect this telegram with thin murder.
We will show by another witness that
they were at this witness' house on the 2d
of "December, 1898. We claim that this
telegram was thus worded merely to
throw some one, perhaps an officer of the
law, on* the track, and that it was In re
sponse to It that Jesse Walters went with
McKenzie to San Francisco to look for
Alfred Cook.
We are going to show that there was a
conspiracy to hunt up Alfred Cook: we
will Bhow that McKenzie and Walters
were looking for Cook and that they
looked for him to kill him.
The court admitted the telegram as
evidence.
Mrs. M. Ray, of San Francisco, tes
tified that she kept a lodging house at
405 Van Ness avenue on December 2,
189S, when McKenzie and Walters vis
ited her house. McKenzie and Walters
talked about Cook. Walters asked Mrs.
Ray if any one visited Mrs. Walters
while Mrs. Walters stopped at the wit
ness' house. Walters said that" if Mrs.
Walters went to San Francisco and
Cook visited her, he would have an
officer there. Alfred Cook had called
at her house. She could not state
whether or not she knew Cook and Dor
man were one. Postal cards were sent
to Mrs. Ray by Mrs. Walters with in
structions x.r> communicate their con
tents to Cook.
"Did you ever deliver to Alfred Cook
any letters addressed to Alfred Dor
man"" asked District Attorney Bell.
This o.uestion nearly threw the wit
ness into a faint, and she begged for
a refined and educated man, he was so
sensitive over his appearance that he
withdrew from his friends and family and
lived in a barn in an obscure part of the
city. He was taken from the barn to
the hospital in a dying condition, and
after his death his brother-inlaw, at
Rogers' request, caused his body to be
cremated in order that the doctors might
not hold a post mortem "examination.

time to recover herself. This was
granted. She then answered:
"No letters."
"Did you ever deliver any written
messages of any kind to Cook which
were addressed to A. Dorman?" con
tinued Bell.
"I don't remember."
The witness testified further that
Cook called three times at her house
when she saw him, and twice when she
did not see him. He introduced him
self as Mrs. Walters' friend. Mrs. Walt
ers generally referred to him as "that
man." She had learned Cook's name
from other persons in Napa when she
was on a visit here. She had heard
the name from ladies.
"Did Mr. Walters or Mr. McKenzie
ask you to suggest a good man to
shadow Mrs. Walters in order that they
might locate Cook?" was another ques
tion that caused the witness great agi
tation.
"I don't remember," she answered,
after considerable hesitation.
"Do you know James Cameron?"
came next.
"Yes, sir."
"Did you ever speak to him of the
visit of Walters and McKenzie?"
"Yes, sir."
"Did you ever tell him they might
have a job for him?"
"Yes, sir."
'Was it not to follow and watch Mrs.
Walters in order to locate Cook?"
"I think it was something of that
kind."
Walters and McKenzie told the wit
ness they wanted to get some man for
the purpose of having Cook arrested
for alienating the affections of Mrs.
Walters. Walters wrote to her after
this visit. She could not recollect what
was in the letter, as she tried to forget
all about the matter after the story of
the killing had been published in the
newspapers.
Peabody was recalled. He said that
he made a picture of Cook at Walters'
request and mailed it to McKenzie.
R. A. Brownlee. formerly under sher
iff with McKenzie, testified to the
friendly relations between McKenzie
and Walters. He also testified that un
der the instructions of McKenzie he
gave Walters a letter to Mr. Blakesley.
a photographer of St. Helena, asking
the latter to give Walters a picture of
Cook for McKenzie. McKenzie showed
the witness the photograph after its
arrival.
Charles Carter, a clerk in the Nana
postofflce, testified that McKenzie
called at the postofflce . to ascertain
whence came letters addressed to Mrs.
Fields. Witness declined to answer the
question as to whether he had ever re
ceived letters addressed to Mrs. M.
Fields on the ground that the instruc
tions to postmasters and postoffice em
ployes prohibited the giving out of such
information. The court instructed the
witness to answer, and he stated that
such letters had been received during
the latter part of 1898.
"Were any of these letters addressed
to Mrs. If. Fields delivered to Mrs.
Jesse Walters?" asked the attorney for
the prosecution. Witness believed he
had delivered a letter addressed to Mrs.
M. Fields, on an order from Mrs. Wal
ters, to William H. Coombs, some time
in November. Some of the letters bore
the postmark of railroad postofnees in
Sacramento County. One on more let
ters were postmarked Ryde.
During the early part of December
McKenzie called at the postofflce and
asked if . there were any letters for
Mrs. M. Fields. Witness said there
were none. McKenzie then" asked if
witness remembered the postmarks on
letters addressed to Mrs. Fields, and
witness said he thought the letters
came from the southern part of the
State. McKenzie called twice on the
same matter.
The examination was continued until
to-morrow.

BOY BURGLARS CAUGHT.
Policemen Ward and Cochrane yester
day afternoon arrested two boys named
Charles Forrest, alias "Kid" Forrest, and
Edward O'Brien on suspicion of having
attempted to break into three houses in
the Western Addition last Tuesday night.
Shortly after 9 o'clock they tried to force
an entrance to the residence of Jacob
Strauss at the corner of Golden Gate av
enue and Franklin street. One of the
occupants heard them at work and put
them to flight. Subsequently they at
tempted to break into another residence
at Golden Gate avenue and Steiner, but
were frightened oft by the barking of a
dog.
About an hour afterward they pried
open the basement of a house near Turk
and Buchanan streets, but were discov
ered and driven away. The Forrest boy
â was seen by one of the occupants of the
house, who after the arrest positively
identified him. A short time ago young
Forrest was arrested for burglary and
sent to the Reform School. He was short
ly afterward released "on the promise to
behave himself in the future.

ESTERHAZY WARNED
HAS RUN AWAY
Leaves Paris to Avoid
Prosecution.
LITTLE HOPE FOR DREYFUS
EVEN HIS FRIENDS NOW FEAR
THE WORST.
The Exile So Angry He Will Give
No Testimony Unless He Is
Taken Back to
Paris.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Feb. I.â Count Ferdinand
Walsin Esterhazy was officially in
formed yesterday that his testimony
before the Court of Cassation in the
Dreyfus inquiry being concluded pro
ceedings against him on criminal
charges would be resumed in twentv
four hours. He left at once for an un
known destination by the Northern
Railway.
Count Esterhazy's flight to evade ar
rest on the charges brought against
him by his cousin, Christian Esterhazv.
of obtaining money under fraudulent
pretenses, has been the sensation of the
day. On reading the warning letter
which was brought to him by a detec
tive, Esterhazy swore and called the
letter a "canaillerie," a "trick worthy
of the beasts 1 have had to deal with."
It is understood that the hasty with
drawal of the safe conduct granted
him was the outcome of his cavalier
treatment of M. Bertulu, the magis
trate, and of his refusal to give further
testimony.
The latest victim of the anti-Dreyfus
party is the Grand Rabbi Zado Khan,
who is being denounced as the "ring
leader of the infamous Jewish con
spiracy against France" on the strength
of a story just published to the effect
that after Dreyfus was sentenced the
rabbi, at the request of Matthieu Drey
fus, tried to get. through a friendly
Jewish officer in Esterhazy's regiment,
same particulars as to the Count's
movements.
Le Soir demands the resignation of
the rabbi, and as the latter is virtually
a state official it is not unlikely that
the agitation will become a serious
matter for him. Curiously enough the
editor of Le Soir, which is one of the
mcst violent of the anti-Dreyfus or
gans, is himself a Jew, named Gastun
Hollonais.
According to a diÃpatch to La Pr^sse
from Cayenne, the capital of French
Guiana, Dreyfus was so angry on learn
ing that Captain Le Brun Renault had
asserted that he confessed at the time
of his trial and degradation that he de
| dined to answer any more </f the ques
tions put to him by the Court of Cassa
tion unless taken back to France.
The most ardent supporters of the
theory that Dreyfus was unjustly con
demned now admit that there is no
longer the- least hope that justice will
be done. A prominent member of the
University of Paris, who I.om the first
has been a militant champion of a re
vision of the trial, says:
"For ninety-nine out of a hundred
Frenchmen the guilt or innocence of
j Dreyfus is a matter of sentiment. All
I the reasoning in the world would not
â  induce them to change their attitude.
There are millions of Frenchmen vyho
will insist upon Dreyfus' guilt in spite
of any proof to the contrary. A feature \
of the situation is that the attitude of i
this majority is dictated by motives â 
â which they believe to be deserving of
the highest respect. I admit that some
WILL BE THE CECIL RHODES
OF THE CHINESE EMPIRE
PEKING, Feb. 1. â The final contract of the mining concession of Mr.
William Pritchard Morgan, Member of Parliament for the Merthvr-
Tydvil division of Wales, in the province of Szechuen. has been signed.
It is understood that the contract secures for Mr. Morgan, in partnership
with an American syndicate and the Chinese authorities, control of all
the mines and oil fields In the prov nee. The Americans, it is added, pro
vide 25 per cent of thÂ«j capital, the Chinese officials provide 30 per cent,
and Mr. Morgan is to provide the balance. Mr. Morgan, it is further as
serted, intends to start with a capital of Â£1,000,000, and proposes to ad
ministrate Szechuen on the same lines as followed by Cecil Rhodes in
South Africa.
It was reported from Hongkong some time ago that Mr. Morgan, in
addition to obtaining most valuable concessions in Szechuen, had ob
tained other very valuable concessions from the Korean government in
an area of about 260 square miles, where he and his associates were to
work all the minerals for seventy-flve years, their buildings and works
to be exempt from taxation and all materials and machinery necessary
for working the mines to be introduced into the country free of duty.
The Korean government, it wad added, was to receive royalty of 23 per
cent of the net profits.
of the Dreyfusards are much to blame
for this. The best cause may be |
ruined by disreputable adherents, and j
! there are men on the Dreyfus side of i
whom every patriotic Frenchman is :
! the natural enemy. While the ma- .
; jorlty of us have been merely demand- j
i ing that justice should be done, a pesti- .
! lent minority has made this demand an j
i excuse for virulent onslaughts on in
-1 stitutions we hold in great esteem."
In conclusion, the member of the unl- j
j verslty predicted that the result of the j
I agitation would be "an onslaught of '
j unparalleled violence on the Jews, as
the masses are convinced that they are
at the bottom of the whole trouble."
It is persistently reiterated in the lob- i
bies of the Palais Bourbon that the
committee of the Chamber of Deputies
now considering the Government's re
vision bill has already decided that the
allegations made by Quesnay de Beau
repaire against M. Loew and other
members of the criminal bench of the
Court of Cassation are without founda
| tion.
According to another rumor the com
mittee's examination of the dossier !
submitted by M. Mazeau, first presl- :
| dent of the Court of Cassation, on the ,
subject of M. Beaurepaire's charges
i shows it to contain letters eulogizing '
I the criminal section written by M. Ma- ;
zeau's own colleagues. The Mazeau
dossier is also said to contain a letter i
! from M. Loew declaring that the mem- j
bers of the criminal section have re- j
celved lettera almost without number ;
containing insults and threats of death, j
M. Loew's letter is also said to
explain that he appointed M. Bard, j
who is an unmarried man, to make
the original report on the Dreyfus case
la order that if these threats of violence
were carried out a whole family should
not be plunged into mourning.

A CANAL BILL
TO BE PASSED
House Republicans Are
in Earnest.
HEPBURN'S NEW MEASURE
WILL PUT MORGAN'S SCHEME
TO ONE SIDE.
Plan Is for This Government to
Build the Great *Cana* as
Its Own Prop
erty.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. I.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: The pros
pects for the enactment of Nicaragua
canal legislation are much brighter
than they have been at any time
since the beginning of the present ses
sion of Congress. The House Commit
tee on Interstate and Foreign Com
merce will meet to-morrow to resume
consideration of the subject, and it is
expected an agreement will be reached
to report a bill to the House.
The measure that will probably be
reported is the bill introduced in the
House by Representative Hepburn of
lowa, chairman of the committee. It
will not be reported, however, as a
House bill, but will be substituted for
the Senate bill, which is now before the
committee. In this way, while the two
houses pass measures differing entirely
in text, the House bill will be techni
cally an amendment to the Senate bill,
and the measure can thus be sent to
conference.
The general belief is that if the bill
can be advanced at this stage some
agreement can be reached that will re
sult in the enactment of a law during
the short time remaining before the ad
journment of Congress.
This will be one of the matters con
sidered at the caucus of the House Re
publicans, which has been called for to
morrow night to take action regarding
the order of business in the House dur
ing the remainder of the session. The
principal point of difference between
the Hepburn bill and the Morgan bill,
which has passed the Senate, lies in the
fact that the Hepburn bill ignores the
Maritime Canal Company entirely and
proposes to have the United States deal
directly with the Governments of Nica
ragua and Costa Rica and construct a
canal just as a harbor improvement
would be made in this country by ap
propriations direct from the treasury.
An amendment will probably be made
to the Hepburn bill to-ninrrow giving
the President authority to so negotiate
with corporations holding concessions
from Nicaragua and Costa Rica as
would enable him to pay the Maritime
Canal Company such sum as he might
find it entitled to.

THE THREE CONSULS
IN SAMOA HAVE A
DISAGREEMENT
Natives Do Little More Fighting,
but Foreign Representatives
Almost Cease Diplomatic
Relations.
AUCKLAND, N. Z., Feb. 1.-The fol
lowing advices have just been received
here from Apia, Samoa, under date of
January 24, from the correspondent of
the Associated Press:
There has been a collision of authori
ty between Chief Justice William L.
Chambers of the Supreme Court and
Dr. Joannes Raff el, the German presi
dent of the municipality, of Apia,
Herr Grosmuhl, a German resident of
Apia, who was arrested for smashing
the windows of the Supreme Court
chamber, was sentenced by the Chief
Justice to imprisonment and to pay a
fine. Dr. Raffel instructed the police
authorities to release Herr Grosmuhl,
whose fine was subsequently fixed at
$1000.
The German Consul, Herr Rose,
thereupon wrote to the American Con
sul, Lloyd W. Osborne. and the British
Consul, E. B. S. Maxse, protesting that
the action of the Chief Justice in fining
Herr Grosmuhl was an infringement
of German consular rights. Messrs.
Osborne and Maxse jointly replied in
their official capacity that, the proper
tribunal having dealt with the matter,
the consuls could not interfere. More
than this, they declined to have further
SOCIETY ATTENDS
THE HORSE SHOW
Brilliant Turnout at Los
Angeles.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. I.â The first
horse show ever held in Southern Cali
fornia opened this afternoon. Upward
of 2000 persons sought admittance. The
scene at Fiesta Park was calculated to
make one think that a great circus had
come to town. Before daybreak
hostlers were astir; by the time the
horses had been fed and watered ar
tisans began to. arrive to put the final
touches on their work.
For the most part the crowd was
from the ranks of the four hundred,
and the fair sex predominated. It
was a gay-appearing throng. Gowns of
brilliant hue and millinery that has
been designed especially for the occa
sion were in evidence, and when the
people were seated in the gaily decor
ated amphitheater a prettier scene
could not have been painted.
To-night the tents were brilliant with
arc lights around center poles, and hun
dreds of incandescent lamps glinting
among the fluttering pennants made
the gaily decorated boxes appear like
transplanted gardens with their ferns,
smilax and flowers. Flags festooned
the center of the arena.
Among the entries are the following:
Walter S. Hobart, San FranciscoâMon
arch. Performer, Damrosch and Seidl, Mr.
Hobarfs favorite four-in-hand park team;
Dip. Sparkle. Spot and Lightfoot; Cannon.
Mortar. Stars and Stripes, a black four

of the bfg tents.

Great preparations, are being made
for floral day (Friday), when the Los
intercourse with the German Consul or
the German municipal president, except
in writing, or to attend meetings, ex
cept to consider the acts of the muni
cipal council of Apia, unless an apology
with full retraction were offered for the
behavior toward Chief Justice Cham
bers. At the same time the Supreme
Court summoned Dr. Raffel for con
tempt of court in releasing Herr Gros
muhl.
There has been no further general
fighting between the partisans of the
rival chieftains since the last advices
were forwarded, except that a part
of Mataafa's followers was routed In
the bush by Malietoans. It is expect
ed, however, that fighting will be re
sumed, as Mataafa is rearresting per
sons who have been already fined
and released.
The work of pillage continues, among
the houses looted being Vailima, the
home of the late Robert Louis Steven
son, the novelist.
The exiled Malietoan chiefs wÂ«re
landed at Pago-Pago, on the island of
Tutuila, the schooner on which they
\vere on being unable to proceed" to the
is and of Manau owing to adverse
winds. The Tutuilans gave them a
hearty welcome and attempted to
seize Mataafa's son, who was on board
the schooner, but the captain put to
sea.
Angeles fire department will appear
headed by Chief Walter Moore.
A contest not on the bills was con
cluded at 3:30 this morning. "Prince
Fortunatus" Hobart and S. W. Still
well, who hails from Montecito and
drives random races, wagered $100 on
the result of a match at random. The
terms of the contest were: Drivers of
random team to maneuver wild cay
uses through the intricacies of a double
eight figure and to avoid wooden ob
stacles. Mr. Hobart won the toss, and
so Mr. Stilhvell of Montecito had to
make the first showing, The upshot of
the affair was that the man from Mon
tecito could not trace a double eight.
Then Mr. Hobart took the ribbons, and
all the difficulties melted away. He
made his double eight the first time,
but knocked down a few obstacles. The
second time he mowed down only three
obstacles. Ringmaster Graham solemn
ly announced the palm awarded to the
San Mateo millionaire.
THE LAST OF THE HORSECARS
The Market Street Company to Be-
construct Its Downtown Roads.
The days of the horsecars in San Fran
cisco are about at an end. It is the inten
tion of the Market-street Railroad Com
pany to start Constructor H. H. Lynch
with his gang of road builders recon
structing its downtown lines just as soon
as the Parnassus avenue roart. leading
to the Affliated Colleges, is finished. Work
will be commenced on Sixth street at
Brannan and will be followed along the
line of that street to Market, up Taylor
to Geary, and down that street to Kear
ny and Market. Here a turn will be made
down Market to Sansome, thence north
as far as Jackson and up that street to
Montgomery, thence along . Montgomery
to Market and back to Geary, where the
double tracks will he used to the end of
the line at Brannan.
Over this entire line electric power will
be substituted for thr present bobtail car 3
th;u have been jogging along since the
city was in its inuait days.
The proposed work on the reconstruct
ed lines will be of the newest and best
BystNÃi adopted for electric service. The
rails will be welded at the joints, thus
making one continuous rail from start to
finish and doing away with the bolting of
the rails, the manner of fastening in days
gone by. By the modern method a light
er rail is used, but by the welding pro
cess equally as solid work in obtained,
as there is no springing under the moving
car at railend joints.
In about six months the electric cars
will be seen spinning through the com
mercial center of the city. The Fifth
street horsecar line will then be the only
one left to remind the pioneer of his early
days.
Residence for Bishop Nichols.
The committee appointed at the Epls-
I copal convention last week to formulate
! plans and devise ways and means for the
erection of an episcopal residence for the
Right Rev. William Ford Nichols. Bishop
of California, met yesterday afternoon
and effected an organization. The fol-
I lowing officers were chosen: William
Babcock, chairman: Rev. William Carson
Sha*w. secretary; William H. Crocker,
treasurer. The Crocker-Woolworth Bank
was made the depository for all funds
collected for the purpose. A special com
mittee, composed of William Babcock, A.
N. Drown and William H. Crocker, was
appointed to take the initiatory steps
the matter. The well-known energy of
the gentlemen makes certain the aceom
| plishment of the desired object and a
beautiful mansion for Bishop Nichols will
soon add to the architectural beauty of
this city.QUARANTINE TO

: I 1 ! -i atch to The Call.
l.< S ANGELES, Feb. I.â A special
meeting of the Board of Health of this
city was held to-day to discuss the
smallpox situation. The Health Officer
reported that there v.-ere at present
eleven developed cases of smallpox In
various stages of the disease and seven
almost recovered. There were also two
or three other cases under surveillance,
in which there were no definite symp
toms as yet. All the cases could be
traced, so the Health Officer though,
to the Hoeggermann cases on Thirty
ninth street and on Seventh and San
Pedro streets. Nevertheless, the cases
â were developing so rapidly that every
l'.>ssible requirement should be adopt
ed for preventing the spread of the
disease. This was especially true of the
requirements as to vaccination.
It was decided that all who had come
in contact with smallpox cases be
quarantined, according to the regula
tions of the board. A statement to the
public was prepared and given out Cor
publication as follows:
At the present time there are eleven
- trf smallpox in this city. Every pre
caution has been tnk^n by the heaJth de
partment to prevent the further spread of
the disease; but as an additional safe
guard the Board of Health recommends
general vaccination for all citizens. Sta
tions for free vaccination will be estab
lished at several places.

CIGARETTES WENT
WITH THE SEWING
MRS. EMILE MERVY, wife of Dr.
Mervy of 411 Montgomery av
enue, has been "fretted" by her
dressmaker. Mrs. Lambert.
whose sign adorns the premises of
909 Post street. According to Mrs.
Mervy, Mrs. Lambert as a dress
maker is no good. According to Mrs.
Lambert. Mrs. Mervy as a patron
ess is delightful. Visiting dressmak
ers at the Mervy residence. In addi
tion to the supply of sheens, thread
and other accessories of the useful
art. are served with stimulants dur
ing the afternoon and an "Egyp
tian deity"â most delightful of lady
cigarettesâwith their after-dinner
coffee.
Mrs. Lambert sewed for Mrs.
Mervy during November last. "I
made elegant gowns for the lady,
who does not know what she
wants." said Mrs. Lambert.
"She botched my dresses and
spoiled my material," Is Mrs.
Mervy'a version.
Whichever side may be right, it
nevertheless transpired that Mrs.
Mervy refused to pay Mrs. Lambert
a bill of $26, and for this sum the
dressmaker brought suit on January
21 In Judge Cook's court. Judge
Cook, being a bachelor, refused to
pass his opinion upon the fit of the
gowns and rendered judgment in
favor of the dressmaker.
This made Mrs. Mervy mad. and
yesterday she got a warrant In Judge
Graham's court charging the dress
maker with malicious mischief and
claiming that Mrs. Lambert, when
remonstrated with in regard to the
fit of a "tea gown," had unmerci
fully slashed the said garment.
Judge Graham found the defendant
guilty and ordered her to appear lor
sentence this morning.
Mrs. Lambert, excited and tearful
at what she considers the miscar
riage of justice, told a pitiful tale,
in which It appears that only her
sense of what Is right and decent
has saved her from straying along
the broad enticing path.
BOXING FOR
THE OELRICHS
GOLD TROPHY
First-Class Sport at
the Olympic Club.
WINNERS OF THE CONTESTS.
W. J. LEONARD WILL DOUBTLESS
CAPTURE THE BELT.
The Handsome Gymnasium Had an
Old-Time Crowd of Sport-
Lovers Present to See
the Mills.
The gymnasium of the Olympic Club
had the appearance of the good old days
last evening when the members gathered
en masse to witness the very excellent
programme of fisticuffs which was ar
ranged by the old Trojan of athletics.
John Hammersmith.
This was the first of a grand series of
boxing contests which will continue for
several months, and If all subsequent en
tertainments will be as good an that
! which was witnessed last evening by the
j large gathering of sport-lovers, it is safe
j to say that the Olympic Club will soon
i be as strong in membershipâ that is nu
merically speakingâ as it has been in its
palmiest days.
M. Cerini of the Reliance Athletic
i Club and Stewart Carter (unattached),
I and one of the best judges of boxing on
i this coast, were selected as Judges of
the contest and James R. Smith of the
Reliance Club of Oakland, referee. The
announcer stated that the limit of eacn
bout must not exceed six rounds and
that the semi-finals would be decided on
! "Wednesday evening, the 13th inst., and
! the finals on some evening to be named
by I. <-ailÂ»-r Hammersmith when the first
I series of each class arc finished.
The lightweights, or in other words, the
125-pound boxers, had their Inning last
evening with the following results:
Peter Duval of the Acme Club and T.
: MoKune of the Alvarado Athletic Club
] were the first brace to toe the scratch.
liuval had the better' of the first, round,
but In the second McKune limbered up
and smashed his opponent several times
:in the lace, which took considerable
j starch out of Duval's collar. In the third
| round Duval, advised by his secondÃ,
i went in for give-and-take punching, and
as a result he compelled his opponent to
j seek safety in retreat. McKune finally
: cried enough and quit before the end of
the round. The referee gave Duval the
decision.
The second event and which was really
the event of the evening, was the meeting
, between \V. J. Leonard of the Olympic
Ctub ami James Higgins of the San Fran
' Cisco Athletic Club, Leonard surprised
I the old-timers by the remarkable clever
ness be showed in ducking swings and
ability to Inflict punishment. He landed
! repeatedly on his opponent with right and
| left and Higgins looked like a red sign
; when the sixth and last round was
I fought. Leonard was given the decision,
| but Higgins. who fought a very game
' battle iigainst superior odds, was award
â  ci! by the officers of the club a special
prise for the gallant and manly stand he
; took when al! hope seemed to be lost to
I him. Higgins, excepting Leonard, was
j certainly the best man who competed
I during the evening. f
i John CapeliÃS of the Acme Club mil
| William Hosken of the Excelsior Club
1 were the next brace on the carpet. The
| first round was evenly contested. In the
second Hosken ai.noycd hie opponent by
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1899.
"In the first place," said Mrs.
Lambert. "Mrs. Mervy brought the
suit in a spirit of revenge. I never
cut up the dress. It was an old.
cheap, soiled cashmere wrapper that
I was 'making over' for her. It was
short in front. There was no hem
at the bottom to let down, and ac
cording to her instructions I cut the
'wrapper' at the waist, lengthened
it that way and covered the piecing
with a velvet girdle. The dress, as
it appeared in court this morning,
was slashed all over. I never did
that.
"Mrs. Mervy," the dressmaker
continued, after she had brushed
away a few tears, "tried hard to
corrupt me. My husband is a cook
and I help him out by dressmaking.
Mrs. Mervy told me I was a fool to
do that. 'You have ftne black eyes,'
she said to me. 'Why don't you
bleach your head red and stop
working?' While I was working
there she used to give me whisky
to drink, and she insisted that I
smoke cigarettes after dinner to
keep her company. I had to do it.
but it made me dreadfully sick.
Then she got her colorf-d house
keeper to try to bring about my
downfall. That housekeeper has
been married five times, and she
told me that any time a man don't
suit she throws him off."
Mrs. Mervy fe^ls it is beneath her
dignity to deny charges brought by
a dressmaker.
"I'm sorry for the woman," she
said. "We ladies suffer so much at
the hands of the dressmaker that
I resolved to be the martyr and
make a dreadful example of Mrs.
Lambert.
"About the cigarettes I have noth
ing to deny. I do smoke one after
dinner. I learned to smoke in Lon
don. I smoke as an aid to digestion,
but 1 never Induced the dressmaker
to. She said she likea to smoke, and
out of pure kindness I let her have
the weed.
"As for my housekeeper, she Is a
perfect lady, and has only been
married two times."
The excitement of the dressmaker
contest has completely unstrung
both womt'i!. Mrs. Mervy hns ;in
attack of neuralgia. Mrs. Lambert
is hysterical.
left-handers on the nose, which drew
claret. In the third round Capelias sent
Hosken to the carpet with a well-directed
right on the point of the jaw. William
remained down eight seconds, but wncn
he regained his pins he fought his ground
Inch by inch. Hoskrn found tne floor
again in the fifth round, and came very
near being sent to dreamland before the
round ended. In the sixth Capeliss was
very tired, and Hosken won a great lead
on points. Referee Smith gave the
award in favor of Hosken. who knocked
the thumb of his right ha_d out of place
in the first round after which he used Â».is
left altogether.
Otto Hasse of the Acme Club and E.
Wiley of the Sacramento Club finished
the evening's sport. The athletes boxed
six rounds. Wiley amused the members
by his grimaces and funny tactics.
Each time Wiley caught a stinger on the
nose he danced around the ring like a
merryman and returned to the charge
with renewed energy. He fought gamely
all through the "mill" and did some very
clever execution with the left, but his
right was practically useless, as he hit
with an open fist. Hasse got the de
cision on points, which count in scientific
boxing only.
The entertainment was first-class and it
goes without saying that It was much
enjoyed by the large crowd of gentlemen
present. ___________
TOO MUCH SPEED AND
AN OLD UNUSED SWITCH
WHAT CAUSED THE ALAMEDA
TRAIN ACCIDENT.
An Abandoned Siding Allowed to
Remain a Menace to
Life.
The accident on the Alameda narrow
gauge Tuesday evening, in which the lives
ofi 400 passengers were jeopardized and in
which Engineer Jonas lost his life, was
undoubtedly due to the indifferent If not
criminal method of operating the road.
Experienced railroad men believe the
cause of the accident was running a light
locomotive at a rapid rate of speed with
the tender before the engine.
When No. 19 pulled out of the mole the
tender was "light." there being little coal
and water aboard, and when It struck the
frog of the unused switch beyond the
curve it left the track. The switch was
built when the railroad company filled in
around the curve and removed the trestle,
and since the work was complete it has
remained there, a menace to the lives of
the thousands of Alnmedans who daily
patronize the narrow-gauge line.
The officials of the road are investigat
ing the cause of -the accident, but. as
usual, do not offer any explanation. They
say it was a fatalism which can never be
explained.
The heart-broken widow of the brave
engineer whose life WU sacrificed lies
prostrated in her desolate home. Hun
dreds <>f sympathetic friends and neigh
bors called yesterday to condole with her,
but none were allowed to see her.
Henry Jonas, the dead hero, was a
member of the Masons' and Odd Fellows*

SACRAMENTO, Feb. I.â A few drops
of rain fell here at noon to-day, with
favorable indications for a good show
er. This brought joy to the fruit grow
ers, as they were fearful of a frost.
The remarkably warm weather of the
past week or two has brought out the
buds at a rapid r^te, and a freeze at
this time would do incalculable injury
to the fruit crop. All conditions at the
present time are favorable.
RIVERSIDE, Feb. I.â Rain began
falling here this evening, with every
prospect of continuing. The rain is
timely, as grain was badly in need of
moisture.
GILROY, Feb. I.â Rain commenced
falling this morning, and continued in
showers during the day. Up to date
over 9 inches have fallen. Crops are all
planted.

MILTON, Feb. I.â Last evening the
weather changed from mild and spring
like to cold and blustering, but not ac-
companled by rain. To-day was cloudy
and threatening and a light rain fell,
and with the wind blowing briskly from
the rainy quarter a good rail is an
ticipated. The mild weather has been
beneficial to this section, and with a
good rainfall now the outlook will be
exceedingly promising for a prosperous
season.
SALINAS, Feb. I.â Owing to recent
rains, and consequently better pastures
many of the large stock owners of this
county are shipping their cattle from
northern counties to the ranches in this
district. Many ranches have had their
cattle over in the Pajaro Valley, feed
ing them on beet pulp, but are now re
turning their stock to this county. The
pasturage is reported as being fine at
the present time.
SAN DIEGO, Feb. I.â lt began rain
ing here at 8 o'clock to-night. Rain is
reported from- La Mesa and Escondldo.
The present rain is greatly needed.
There is a very large acreage of grain
that is just up. and rain is needed to
give It a good start. With a moderate
precipitation now the immediate out
look for crops in this county will be
very bright.
STOCKTON, Feb. I.â About .13 ff an
inch of rain fell in this city this even
ing, and the indications to-night point
to more. There was a light shower up
the valley, and at Clauston .35 Is re
ported. The rain improves the crop
conditions, and the small amount re
reived will partially overcome the very
hot weather of the past ten days.
SAN JOSE, Feb. I.â A slight sprinkle
of rain fell during the night and several
times during the forenoon there were
light showers. So far the total is but
a trace. There has been a great fall
in temperature since this time yester
day, and there was some snow on the
mountains, both on the east and west
side of the valley. The unusually warm
weather of the past ten days or two
weeks hps advanced vegetation too rap
idly. The almond trees are budding.
No other fruit shows much advance
ment yet. Grain has grown wonder
fully, and "should there be cold weather
it might suffer, as it is exceedingly ten
der, resulting from the rains first and
warm sup since. The total rainfall to
date is 6.20 inches. The wind is now
from the south- barometer, 29.80.
SANTA ORT T Z. Feb. 1. â Shower* of

RYAN LANDS FREELY
ON TOM SHARKEY
Forfeit Put Up to Bind a Match Be
tween the Sailor and
Fitzsimmons.
SYRACUSE. N. V., Feb. I.â Eighteen
hundred people witnessed the six-round
bout between Tommy Ryan and Tom
Sharkey before the Monarch Athletic Club
to-night. The event was purely an exhi
bition. In which the Syracuse man clearly
demonstrated that he was far the superior
of his antagonist as a boxer, landing
freely. Sharkey was somewhat dazed at
the showing and frequently laid himself
open. No damage was done by either
man.
Tom O'Rourke said to-night: "I have
forwarded to-night a certified check for
$2500 to bind a match between Tom Shar
key and Bob Fltzslmmons before the club
offering the largest purse, the referee and
conditions to be mutually agreed upon as
soon as a club qualifies."
NEW YORK, Feb. I.â The time having
elapsed for Tom O'Rourke to cover Fitz
simmons' $2500 for a fight between Fitz-
Bimmonp and Sharkey. O'Rourke came to
night with a propostion that looks like
business. From Syraceuse he sent the
following dispatch to John Boden Jr., a
well-known sporting writer In this city,
which will probably have the effect of
bringing the Australian and the sailor to
gether. The telegram was as follows:
I have forwarded certified check for $2.*00
to you to-night as a forfeit to bind a match
between Tom Sharkey and Bob Fltzslmmons,
to be decided before the club offering the
largest purse, referee and time of contest to be
mutually agreed upon. I will meet either Fitz
slmmons or his representative at any time con
venient to both of us. to sign articles as snon
as the club is forthcoming with a suitable
purse.

SEEKING GOLD IN
THE MARIN HILLS
Prospectors FIocK to tf)e Scerje
of the Discovery Near
Larkspur.
LARKSPUR, Feb. I.â Since the news of the discovery of gold at
Escalles Station was published in The Call the gold fever has
broken out in pronounced form in Marln County and the contagion
has spread across the bay. For two days the mountains in this
vicinity have been thronged by people eager to gather in the yellow
nuggets. They are armed with picks, shovels, drills and other in
struments belonging to the prospectors' kit.
Early Monday morning about twenty persons from across the
bay got off at Escalles and climbed the hillside. Some of them were
so bold as to start prospecting on the upper end of the vineyardist's
property, and he has had to keep a vigilant watch in order to keep
his vines from being uprooted. Others wanted Escalles to form a
company and let them be shareholders. One man carried a small
compass-like instrument which he claimed would locate gold if
brought within fifty feet of a ledge. He was the same person who
tried to induce Leo Goetz to let him locate the cache where Bandit
Newton's gold is believed to have been burled on Reservoir Hi!!,
near West End Station, San Rafael. The redoubtable Goetz him
self deserted his first love and came down with pick and shovel to
prospect near here to-day. Both Escalles and his wife express their
sorrow that the news of the discovery ever became public property
and hope the excitement will soon die out.

San Francisco Yacht Club Will Elect
N|w Officers â A Very Strong

Reserve and did excellent service during
the war. She will carry fresh meat from
California to Dewey's fleet at Manila,
Yesterday afternoon she went up to Mare
Island, and after being overhauled will
make her first trip from this port.

beef and mutton between Australia and
England. She was owned by the Federal

and is 3735 tons gross register. Her beam
Is 44 feet and mean draft 24 feet 9 inches.

James Kitterman is the owner of the
fine launch America. He is an enthusias
tic yachtsman, and will be a welcome
addition to the ranks of the San Fran
ciscans.
L. Q. Haven has forsaken the wind
jammers and is now owner of the launch â 
Alberta. His old love, the Sappho, will .
still remain flagship of the squadron. E. :
C. Bartlett of the Frolic and I. Gutte of

lain is known all over the southern seas.
His yacht has not been seen much in the
bay." as Captain Turner's home is at Be
nicia This year, however, he is going i

LIFE, and If from any cause they be enfeebled
or broken down, the miseries that result are
BEYOND ALL, TELLING. Lassitude and
debility, sleeplessness and discomfort, gloom,
fretfulness and incipient mania, loss of vital

JOHNSON AND BURNS.
IF there is any member of the Legislature without
excuse for his advocacy of Dan Burns, Grove
L. Johnson is the man. He has been a lawyer of
recognized ability for many year?. He has served
gress and has met and heard the great men
who, in the Senate of the United State*, speak for
seventy-five millions of people as well as for their re
spective States. He is familiar with the qualifications
Federal Senator should possess, and without
which he is a nonentity or a disgrace. Yet he de
y supports Dan Burns, and. when so mon
;; candidacy evokes criticism that ought to be
unnecessary, he tries to place shackles on the limbs
of the press.
Mr. Johnson knows better. He is not acting in the
(iark, or in ignorance. There is no journalist, legis
lator or citizen in the State who more fully compre
thc truth that, on his merits in statesmanship,
apart from the niriuences by which he is surrounded
and saturated, Dan Burns could not be elected a
Supervisor. About this there is no possible mistake.
The only claim ever put forward for the gentleman
from Mexico was that he had been assailed by two
newspapers. Such an argument on its face is not
cnly absurd but stupid. There is no additional ele
n.ent through which it can be strengthened by Mr.
Johnson or by any one else. The situation is unique
because, in the face of day. wantonly and maliciously,
these indescribable pretensions are backed by un
scrupulous intelligence and hold the. Legislature
deadlocked.
The Assemblyman from Sacramento for years
seems to have made it his business to antagonize the
public at every point. He acts as a disappointed man
Aho is too narrow to rise above the surface of a
petty revenge. The spectacle of intellectual faculties
bent to a set and malignant purpose, and using offi
cial station without regard to the public interest, is
not only unfortunate, but a waste of opportunity.
But Mr. Johnson appears to glory in his own shame
and employs his legislative station for the ventilation
of Li- own personal grievances and the pertinacious
advocacy of men and measures injurious to his im
mediate constituents and obnoxious to that larger
constituency upon which his reputation must depend.
He berates the press and abuses his privilege by per
petually committing the very acts he professes to
condemn. To rise under the sting of criticism, like
a hyena from his lair, and show his teeth and spit at
journalism, is a mean attitude for a statesman, and a
display only equaled by the obstinate support of a
Senatorial candidate whose catalogue of qualifications
15 nothing but a stained blank.
Tennyson informs us that 'men may rise on step
ping-stones of their dead selves to higher things,"
but the ex-Congressman is proving that through their
dead selves men may sink to unfathomable depths.
VOTING MACHINE TESTS.
DESPITE the recent exposure of a conspiracy
to defraud the State through the introduction
of a system of conducting elections by means
of balloting machines, the Legislature is giving con
siderable attention to the subject, and bills providing
for making tests of such machines have been intro
duced into both the Senate and the Assembly. It is
r ight that this should be so. There is no reason why
a desirable reform should be delayed simply because
some rascals have been detected in a scheme to make
a profit out of it.
Th results of extensive experiments with balloting
machines in the East have been sufficiently satisfac
tory to render it certain that sooner or later the
whole country will adopt the system. It is superior
to the present method in every respect. It is more
economical, more accurate, more speedy and is free
from liability to frauds or errors in counting.
The only effect of the discovery of the scheme to
defraud the State in the purchase of the machines
will be that of putting the people on guard and mak
ing the officials more careful and wary in adopting
the system than they would have been otherwise.
That will delay the introduction of the method to
some extent, but the delay may prove beneficial, for
in the?e. as in all newly adopted machines, improve
ments will be made rapidly and the price will fall. A
year or two years from now we may be able to pur
chase better machines than could be obtained at pres
ent and at less price.
While ihe delay necessary to make sure of starting
right and of getting the balloting machines at a
reasonable price will not be objected to, there will be
a good rieal of gratification in the fact that steps are
to be taken at once to make thorough tests of the
different machines and thus prepare the way for their
adoption. Our present balloting system is cumber
some, costly, slow, inaccurate, and subject to various
kinds of frauds in the counting. It will be a good day
U the State when we can have all ballots received,
registered and counted by a mechanism that works
with precision and is not subject to the human infirm
ities of the average election officer.
There is no denying that a desperate prisoner with
access to matches and kerosene can create an interest
ing time.
SENATOR PERKINS AND THE TREATY
ON the sixth day of this month Senator Perkins
will have the opportunity of his life. Believ
ing in popular government, in which every
true American agrees with him, he invited a legis
lative instruction that was contrary to his own per
sonal convictions, and which, upon reflection, we'
hope he may deem it his duty respectfully to disre-
gard. If the question were the improvement of San
Pedro harbor or the deepening of the Oakland chan
nel, or any Federal appropriation for the particular
benefit of this State, it would certainly devolve upon
him either to obey the Legislature or to resign. But,
when the institutions of his country are in peril, when
this majestic republic is pointed toward the surging
waves of imperialism, when he is directed to indorse
the divine right of kings as a source of title to an
archipelago and to hold that the Declaration of Inde
pendence has no application to nine millions of Fili
pinos, obedience to a State Legislature may be trea
son to the nation. It is the will of forty-five Ameri
can States, incorporated into an indissoluble Union,
and having the future of mankind in charge, that,
with a deep sense of responsibility, Senator Perkins
is required to register. And, unless he abrogates his
principal functions, that will must be ascertained by
his own independent judgment. The atmosphere at
Washington may have its own peculiar odors, but
it is at least free from the stench that offends the
nostrils of honest legislators in the present Senatorial
contest in this State. The air of the Senate chamber
is not yet deadly to patriotism.
Senator Perkins is a living example of what brains,
thrift, integrity and energy can achieve under Ameri
can institutions. It was the protection of the con-
stituiion that enabled him to carve his way from
humble beginnings to his present exaltation. He
cannot forget or ignore his Americanism, nor upon
~sue of possible life or death to the Government,
a- it is now fashioned, prefer a void legislative in
struction to fidelity to his oath of office and the wel
of the largest free and independent community
â¢â  on earth or recorded in history. He is sur
ided by colleagues, some of whom have uttered
sentiments to which the heart of citizenship through
out the Union has responded, and which may have
' sounded the keynote to the last desperate struggle
between despotism and liberty. "Our Commission
came back from Paris," said the great Senator
Massachusetts, "bringing with them the cast-off
clothing of the pinchbeck Napoleon and ask us
who have seen his fate, to discard for them the spot
i less robes in which our fathers arrayed the beautiful
| genius of America." And this antithesis to Dan Burn-,
! this master of law and of rhetoric, with the blood
| of heroic ancestry coursing through his veins, held
up before the world the supreme and controlling pur
pose defined in the preamble to the Federal constitu
j tion, to which all of its express and implied powers
are subordinate, and as an American statesman
ground the argument of the imperialists to powder.
And in these memorable words he met the false
rhapsodists over military glory, "When you raise the
flag over the Philippines, as an emblem of domain
and acquisition, you take it down from Independence
Hall." Even his narrower allusion to his own political
service pathetically approached the theme of nation
ality and must have appealed with almost irresistible
force to Senator Perkins, who can say of the Repub
lican party, dedicated to freedom and unity, "all of
which I saw and part of which I was." We will re
peat the language of Mr. Hoar: "I stood in a humble
capacity by its cradle. I do not mean, if I can help
1 it, to follow its hearse."
These are the expressions of one Federal Senator,
which in virility and in beauty have been unsurpassed
but nearly equaled by many. They ought to consti
tute a controlling example for our Republican Sen
ator, expanded beyond the lines of party, who stands
for the milliions of Americans, to whom this country,
in ts integrity and in its grandeur, is the type for fu
ture history, and who spurn alike Asiatic adulteration
and imperialistic revolution.
We sincerely trust that the vote of Senator Per
kins will help to frame an intelligent answer to Sen
ator Mason's inquiry: "How is liberty to be estab
lished?" Is it to be done hypodermically with a
13-inch gun?" We hope that the country and the
world may be spared the infliction of the Republican
Senator from California occupying his seat, with his
lips closed and his limbs manacled, while his ears are
filled with legislative orders, in which the voices of
Howard E. Wright and the Burns contingent can be
clearly distinguished.
AN EXPERIMENT IN TROPICAL EX
PANSION. Â»
rROM a summary given in Public Opinion of a
recent address by Mr. Courtney, president of tTie
Royal Statistical Society, on "An Experiment
in Commercial Expansion," it appears the experience
of Belgium in trying to expand her commerce by es
tablishing a vast colony in Central Africa contains an
important lesson for the expansionists of this coun
t:"> who delude themselves with the belief that we can
nake tropical colonies commercially profitable.
Mr. Courtney was led to make an inquiry into the
subject by the frequency with which it is asserted
that the great producing nations must establish colo
nies and assume dominion over the less civilized
races of the world in order to provide markets for the
products of their industry. His object was to dis
cover whether the results of experience justify that
belief, and he chose the Congo Free State for his
examination because it is free from the interference
of national rivalries and affords a full, fair field for
colonial expansion to show what it can accomplish
for the promotion of the trade of the parent state.
One of the first facts that impressed Mr. Courtney
in pursuing his statistical inquiry was the deadly
effect of the tropical climate upon the Europeans
who go to the colony either to carry on trade or to
conduct the governmental administration. It is esti
mated that of every ten whites who become officers
of state nine are either buried or invalided within
three years, and the employes of the largest Belgian
trading company, who number 120/ maintain only
an average service of seven months out of the twenty
four for which they are contracted. It is asserted
that at no time within a proximate future can a body
of European officials be continued in the colony with
any permanency of its constituent elements.
Against that appalling death and invalid rate there
are no commercial profits to be shown. The daring
colonizers have labored and perished in vain. It is
said that in spite of numerous and severe taxes, in
spite of royal gifts and Belgian loans reckoned as
income, the budget of state has in no single year
shown an equality of receipts with expenditure. The
trade of the country, which has cost so much in life
and treasure, remains comparatively 9mall, and con
stitutes but 0.7 per cent of Belgian commerce.
Mr. Courtney's conclusion is that if the Belgians
had employed at home the money expended in the
Congo colony, and had used it for reducing the bur
dens on their trade and industry, the expenditure of
the treasure would have had a far greater effect in
increasing Belgian commerce. In other words, while
seeking the shadow of trade in the jungles of the
THE SAN FKANC7SCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1899.
African tropics, the Belgian expansionists have lost a
considerable part of their substantial trade with other
nations. Their colonial enterprise has proven to be
a gold brick of the worst kind.
From the lesson of this experiment our American
expansionists ought to learn wisdom. That the Phil
ippines are unhealthy and deadly to the American is
proven by the experience of our volunteers now in
the islands. That it will be costly to govern them is
made certain by the sullen attitude already assumed
by the Filipinos. It is the merest folly to expect
either national or commercial profit from colonial
expansion in such a country. Like the Belgians, we
can expand our commerce rmaje effectually by light
ening the burdens at home than by increasing them
for the sake of colonial adventures in the tropics.
SUPPRESSION OF CARTOONS.
AS there are two sides to every question, there
are grounds for opposition to the cartoon.
We admit this freely. As to whether the
grounds are such as to appeal to the intelligence
must be left to individual judgment.
When a legislator has a bad record, to the length
of which he is striving to add, no wonder he lifts his
tearful eyes in protest to see his character portrayed,
and rends the heavens with his wails. He is ex
periencing precisely the emotions of the rogue who
feels the halter draw, only the legislator feels the
artist draw.
There can be no doubt that Wright viewed with
distaste the pictures of himself, showing him to be
crooked. It would not be surprising if a member
depicted in the act of sloshing himself with white
wash would rather he had not been detected and ex
posed. Let it not be denied that the howlers have a
grievance. Probably the cat concerting nocturnally
in the back yard would welcome a statute forbidding
the hurling of a reformatory brick.
Now, to the newspapers of California very little is
involved in the fate of the justly celebrated anti
cartoon bill, for they would not pay to it the slightest
attention. As an abridgment of the freedom of the
press, the constitution, still recognized as a docu
ment of considerable merit, would knock it into a
cocked hat at the first test. When a paper oversteps
the bounds by word or illustration, there is remedy
in law, and it is the only remedy the kickers will get,
saving, of course, the shotgun, of which they talk so
freely.
There is for the honest man no sting in the car
toon. If so be he have large ears the world would
never know it through the work of an artist while
the ears were restrained in their tendency to wag,
and even a luxuriant jungle of whiskers would es
cape if only the \vind of buncombe did not agitate
them unduly. For a man afraid of his record the
cartoon is a thing of terror, herein being its virtue.
If such men are in the majority, doubtless the scheme
will be put to practical trial, but we suggest the
slaughter of the artists as the only effective quietus.
This might be made possible by the passage of the
luminous and idiotic Morehouse bill authorizing any
citizen offended by a paper to take to the warpath
and found a private graveyard of imposing propor
tions.
TfIXfITION OF CHURCH PROPERTY.
THE petition presented to the Legislature by the
California Society for Exempting Churches
From Taxation is not unreasonable and should
be granted. The request it embodies is one which in
volves no questions of public policy or expediency;
the society merely asks that a constitutional amend
ment be submitted to the people exempting real es
tate and improvements used exclusively as churches
and chapels from taxation.
Whether it is good policy to free this species of
property from the burdens of government need not
be considered in any debate which may take place
over the adoption in the Legislature of such a con
stitutional amendment. The only question that can
possibly be involved is whether or not the people of
the State of California ought to be given an oppor
tunity to pass upon the problem.
It is the custom in these days to submit everything
to the judgment of the people, the assumption being
that they are infallible and will decide all questions
according to the best public policy. Upon the sub
ject of exempting churches from taxation there will
undoubtedly be a spirited debate when the consti
tutional amendment comes up for ratification; there
is a great deal to be said on both sides, but the
proposition is one that is easily understood and con
cerning which there need be no mystery. Every
voter can readily resolve the question for himself and
according to what he considers the best interests of
the commonwealth.
Until 1867 church property was exempt from taxa
tion under the laws of this State. In that year the
Supreme Court discovered that the revenue act under
which the exemption had been set up conflicted with
the constitution, and in the case of The People vs.
McCreery it was decided that that species of property
must be assessed and taxed. But not until now has
anybody attempted to disturb the doctrine of the
constitution that all property in the State shall be
taxed in proportion to its value.
A strong point in favor of submitting the propo
sition under discussion to a vote of the people con
sists in the fact that in every other State of the
Union property used for religious purposes to which
there is attached no income is exempt from taxation.
There must be something in a doctrine which so uni
versally prevails, and undoubtedly it ought to be dis
cussed and settled in California. There should be no
opposition in the Legislature to the submission of
a proposition in which so many people are interested
and concerning which there is so much to be said pro
and con.
Assemblyman Mead's effort to have superfluous at
taches given leave of absence so that they might not
be at the expense of paying board bills was kind and
thoughtful. It would also have tended to the ex
pedition of business, as where attaches are so thick
they fall over each other they ought to be thinned
out.
The two boys who wrecked the interior of a hat
factory present puzzling examples of depravity far
more difficult to deal with than the act of a mature
and hardened criminal. It is safe to say, however,
that no community with such a pair loose in it is
safe. ,
Dibble would have the loaning of money by a
Senatorial candidate to a prospective legislator made
a felony. There ought to be a clause characterizing
the act of accepting such a loan and then voting for
the rival candidate. That's meaner than mere felony.
The fifty-year prisoner who has just been found
guilty of murder and been sentenced for life is prob
ably not enough worse off than he was to feel the
difference.
Uncle Sam's soldiers are good fighters, but those
among them who fill up on water front whisky do
make more noi9e than absolutely necessary.
RANCHO AND RURAL LIFE.
G. Loppens, a flax expert of Neerpelt, Belgium, gives a very high in
dorsement to flax fiber raised on the coast, which he has had scutched in
the Neerpelt mills. Mr. Loppens is the inventor of a tank system for retting
flax, to take the place of pond retting. Experiments have been made in
this State with ramie, which is one of the substitutes for flax and yields a
more silky fiber, but the difficulty of decorticating it has so far blocked
the way to its profitab c introduction as a field crop. But with a system or
tank retting of flax it would seem that it should become a profitable crop
when both fiber and seed can be utilized. Flax manufacture is a moist
climate industry, confined heretofore quite exclusively to Ireland and the
low countries. Its greatest center is at Lys in West Flanders. It may
prove that our moist valleys near the coast are suited to it.
In 1594 Switzerland took only $720 worth of California dried fruit and
in 1897 she took $700,000. Now Switzerland excludes all of our unpeeled dried
fruit for fear of the San Jose scale, and the State Board of Trade is endeav
oring to get this decree modified.
Many common words, descending through all languages from the primi
tive past, had their origin in the occupations of rural life. Daughter in
German "tochter," in ancient Greek "thusgater." in ancient Hindoo dui
tar," is derived from the Aryan and means "a milker." It comes down
from a time when the people were herdsmen and every daughter was a milk
maid. In like manner pecuniary, Latin pecunia, money, comes from "pi
cus," a herd of cattle, and tells of a time when cattle were used as money.
At last there is a concentration of interests in this State to secure pro
tection of our forests, and the permanency of their crop of merchantable
timber. The Society of Waters and Forests has been formed and its good
faith is shown by its refusal to immediately attack the treasury. Its ex
ecutive committee has memorialized the Governor to ask the Legislature for
authority to appoint an unsalaried commission of five citizens to serve for
two years and the office then to cease and determine. This commission is
to pay its own expenses and to investigate the whole question of scientific
forestry the relation of the preservation of forests to the conservation of
water and the impounding and distribution of the surplus, or flood waters.
Of course such request, of the Governor will be acceded to and the State "will
have begun in the right way to protect and preserve its matchless forests
and the permanent resources of wealth which they represent.

NEW RUBBER
TRUST STRIKES
A BIG SNAG
Manufacturers Will
Not Come In.
BAIT FAILS TO ATTRACT
CLUB OVER EDITOR DUNLAP'S
HEAD.
Charles R. Flint, the Chief Promoter
of the Scheme, Threatens Him
With a Libel Suit for With
holding Support.
The efforts of Charles R. Flint, the New
York capitalist, backed by a syndicate of
Eastern bankers, to organize a new rub
ber trust under the name of the "Rubber
Goods Manufacturing Company," are not
meeting with the brilliant success antici
pated.
Mr. Flint was In San Francisco a short
time ago in the interest of his pet project
and rosy pictures of the big money to be
made by those who went into the pro
posed scheme were freely circulated. But
for some reason or other Mr. Flint's mis
sion to the coast wns not crowned with
success and it appears, according to re
ports received from the East, that he is
having a hard row to hoe in his endeavor
to induce the independent manufac
turers to surrender their business or ex
change their holdings for stock in the
new concern. Not only that, but the pro
motors of the new trust have succeeded
In antagonizing the India Rubber World,
I a paper of wide Influence, devoted to the
interests of manufacturers ajid dealers of
rubber goods. The result has been a
; declaration of "war to the knife" between
j the trust promoters and the paper, which
promises to become exceedingly interest
ing as time passes. Mr. Flint's alleged
threat to sue the editors of the paper for
criminal libel has had the effect of in
creasing the bitterness of feeling and all
efforts to patch up the quarrel, which Is
Is to have its origin in the attempt of Mr.
Flint to whip the India Rubber World
into lino in support of hia scheme, have
signally failed.
The new trust is intended as a sort of
running mate to the United States Rub
ber Company, organized by Mr. Flint, of
which he is at present treasurer. The
United States Company controls the boot
and shoe trade and the manufacture of
all -kinds of hard rubber. It is proposed
that the Rubber Goods Manufacturing
t Company shall control the manufacture
and sale of all lines not classed as hard
rubber goods. The assets of the com
panies now in the trade that are con
sidered eligible to join the new combina
tion are estimated at $15,000,000, and they
are credited with doing a business of $25,
--000,000 per annum. The capitalization of
the new company has been fixed at $30,
--000,000, one-half the stock to be issued in
7 per cent cumulative preferred shares
and the remainderâ representing trade
marks, patents, good will and presumably
service contracts â in ordinary common
shares. It was originally intended to in
corporate the company In New Jersey two
weeks agro, but the fact that the incor
poration papers have not been filed la
taken as conclusive evidence that the
scheme has slipped a cog somewhere.
When the movement for the organiza
tion of the trust was first started Mr.
Flintâ who was selected to engineer the
schme because of his success in launching
the United States Rubber Company on its
successful career â approached the propri
etors of the India Rubber World to secure
the support of their paper for the enter
prise. Right here he encountered an un
expected obstacle. The publication is
jointly owned and edited by H. C. Pear
son and John R. Dunlap. While Mr.
Pearson was inclined to look with favor
on the proposition, Mr. Dunlap declared
he would have nothing to do with it. HÂ©
was alternately cajoled and threatened,
but all to no purpose. Finally Mr. Dun
lap, in view of the difference of opinion
on the subject prevailing between him
self and his partner, offered to sell his
share of the paper outright. This did not
suit Mr. Flint, however. He desired above
all things to retain the services of Mr.
Dunlap with the paperâ perhaps fearing
that if he should dispose of his share in
the publication Mr. Dunlap might imme
diately start a rival sheet, which would
be bound to antagonize the rubber con
solidation scheme.
According to the story going the rounds
in this city, a plan was concocted to
force Dunlap into line. On December 30
Mr. Pearson paid a visit to the office of
Mr. Flint in New York. After a brief
consultation with Mr. Flint and S, P. Colt
of the United States Rubber Company,
who is also interested in the new trust
scheme. Mr. Dunlap was sent for. and
asked to state his position. Just what
occurred is not stated, but a stenog
rapher, secreted in the room, is said to
have made a verbatim report of all that
transpired. With this report as evidence
Mr. Flint is alleged to have threatened to
prosecute the India Rubber World "for
attempting to extort money under threat
of making injurious publications."
The following day a representative of
Mr. Flint called at the office of the paper
and tried to restore harmony. He assured
Mr. Dunlap that if he would withdraw his
opposition there would be no prosecution
and that the events of the preceding day
should be considered as never having
taken placeâ in other words it was "all a
blunder." As an earnest of his sincerity,
or the sincerity of the trust he repre
sented, the visitor gave promises of ex
tensive advertising in the India Rubber
World if it would adopt a friendly atti
tude, and actually submitted an order for
over $18,000 worth of space in the paper.
Mr. Dunlap refused to accept the over
tures of the trust, however, and the
agent of the monopoly left the sanctum
with the understanding that it was to be
"war to the knife."
One of. the arguments used by the pro
moters of the new scheme is that the
combination of the leading manufacturers
of rubber goods will enable the tmst so
formed to immediately reduce the price
of its products 7% per cent, by reason of
reduced operating expenses. ' The history
of the United States Rubber Company is
pointed to as showing the perfection of
this idea. It is further claimed that by
reason of its greater capital and increased
facilities, the trust could control the price
of the raw product, and thereby shut out
the competition of the smaller concerns
operating independently. The opponents
of the trust point to the fact that with all
its immense capital the United States
Rubber Company has not boon a glorious
success, inasmuch as a number of fac
tories which it was compelled to buy at
fabulous prices paid larger dividends than
the trust can ever hope to pay. For in
stance, the Converse Company paid $1,800.
--000 in a single year on a capitalization of
$5,000,000. which is more than the trust
which absorbed it has paid in any one
year with a capital of $40,000,000. It is also
claimed that the rubber business offers
irresistible inducements for money mak
ing for persona with comparatively small
capital, and that, trust or no trust, inde
pendent factories are bound to continue
to exist and flourish and that as one 1b
bought up another will take its place. In
fact the business of starting factories for
the purpose of selling the same to the
trust may soon come to be a recognized
and profitable Industry.

flight of the soul from the body and bear
ing the Inscription, "Our Lamented Col
league," from the members of the Legis
lature. Immense pillows made of violets,
maiden bells and a variety of ferns were
placed along the sides of the casket, while
the hundreds of delicately perfumed roses
of various hues perfumed the air.
At 10:45 the Rev. Robert C. Foute of
Grace Episcopal Church stepped to the
head of the casket and read the beauti
ful and Impressive funeral service of the
Episcopal QJlurch, concluding with a
prayer. The remains were then conveyed
to the Palace court, where the hearsa
and carriages were in waiting, preceded
by the honorary pallbearers and the leg
islative delegation and followed by the be
reaved widow and children of the de
ceased. Following were the honorary
pallbearers, all of them life-long friends
of the dead: Lieutenant Governor Jacob
H. Neff, Senator E. W. Chapman, Gen

The legislative delegation was composed

The funeral cortege wended its way to
the Southern Pacific station at
Third and Townsend streets, where
a special \, train was in waiting
to convey the mourners to Cy

been erected by the side of the open grave
to shield the funeral 1 party- from the sun
or rain during the brief ceremony at
tending the placing of the body in the
ground. As the casket was lowered below
the surface Dr. Foute read the burial
service and an improvised choir, com
posed of friends of the family, sang
"Nearer My God to Thee." A closing
prayer followed, and as the threatening
clouds ' overhead began to send forth
warning drops the clods of earth began
to fall on the coffin that held all that
was earthly of him who was held all that
while on earth as one of "Gods Noble

ACTIVITY ON EAST STREET
MORE DEMAND FOR WATER
FRONT PROPERTY.
A Complete Review of the Records,
New Building Contracts, Re
cent Sales and General
Notes.
Realty is still finding a good market,
both in the city and throughout the
State generally. Sales are increasing
gradually, as thosÂ»?> desirous of buying
become more fully convinced that an
undoubted change for the better is
rapidly succeeding tho old and long ex
istent business stagnation which has
been such a hindrance to progression
during the past two years, and which
has kept real estate at a deplorable
standstill.
The particular section of the city,
however, that brokers are looking to
for an extensive improvement in the
near future is that situated in the
vicinity of the water front. It has been
rumored that one of the large trans
continental railways is seeking access
to the city by the purchase of the North
Pacific Coast Railway. Negotiations
for a terminal point directly on the
water front bounded by Lombard, Bat
tery, Sansome and Oreen streets, which
will serve as a depot for freight pur
poses, are said to be now being made.
A certain credence is given to the
rumor by the recent purchase of a large
piece of property by an Eastern man
for an estimated price of $70,000.
In addition to this probable advent of
another railway into the city, every in
dication is in favor of a rapid and com
plete change in the entire water-front
property. Large business firms, actuat
ed by the certainty that this section of
the city is destined to be the most
valuable and active from a commercial
standpoint, are one by one vacating old
quarters and are moving closer toward
East street. This theory is substan
tiated by the recent removal of the
firm of Levi & Co., or.c of the largest
wholesale grocery firms on the coast,
from their old quarters on the southerly
line of Market street to the junction of
Market and Sacramento streets.
The birth and organization of the
X'irth Central Improvement Company
is another instance in proof of the
growing importance of this part of the
city. The owners of property within
the section of the city under the juris
<l; < tinn of this new company are con
vinced that realty will from now on
steadily increase in value if the neces
sary street and building improvements
are made to facilitate the proper hand
ling of a rapidly increasing commerce.

A RACY BIT

She Came From the
Clouds and Won.
SURVIVOR DEFEATS GAUNTLET
SATSUMA FELL IN WITH EASY
COMPANY.
Three Favorites in Front at Oak
land â Lost Girl, Superbly Bidden
by Mike Hennessy, Won,
Heavily Backed.
Probably the best of the many good
performances at Oakland track yesterday
was â  the remarkable run made by the
Riley-Jennie Treacy fllly, Jennie. Riley,
in t lie two-year-old scramble. She had
shown up well in her former races and
was pent to the post equal favorite with
Galene, from the Burns & Waterhouse
stable. Spencer had the mount, and when
the barrier was released the filly was two
lengths behind the bunch. After making
many tortuous twists and curves Spencer
gradually ran his field down, getting up
just in time to beat the good thing, Cho
teau, a head. Galene found the pace too
warm, finishing third. The winner closed
up ground so fast the last sixteenth of a
mile that those occupying seats in the
trainers' stands could hardly believe their
eyes when the numbers were hoisted.
Rain left the track a trifle slow, but
not heavy enough to make any difference
with non-mud runners. Three favorites
succeeded in taking purses.
Nick Hall's old geiding, Two Cheers,
seems to have lost his usefulness. He
was installed favorite over the ragged
lot in the opening mile and a sixteenth
run and was beaten in hollow fashion by
Eppinger. The latter, ridden by Bull
man, was once 5 to 1 in the betting.
If Wing, the entry of Tom Ryan,
had not been pounds the best of the start
ers in the sprint that followed the money
bet on him would have been burnt up.
Starting favorite, the brown filly was cut
off at the start, but ran around her field
and won comfortably from Odd Eyes.
Crossmalina. coming fast at the end, was
a close third.
After making such a good showing in
the handicap on Saturday last, the talent
picked Gauntlet to beat Survivor in the
mile purse run. It proved an unwise se
lection, for Pat Dunne's colt galloped thÂ©
entire distance, winning with ease in slow
time. Ballista was a poor third, behind
the favorite.
Bald-faced Satsuma annexed the mile
and a sixteenth selling purse. A 4 to 5
favorite, he took the lead in the stretch
and was going away at the wire. The
light-weighted Rosebeau disposed of the
miserably ridden Morinel for the place.
In the last event, at six furlongs, Lost
Girl came out after a long rest and, ably
ridden by Mike Hennessy. downed a big
field of sprinters. She was at one time
as good as 8 to 1 in the ring, and after
being ridden hard from the start led Do
lore out a head. The favorite, Amelia
Fonso, was third.
Track Notes.
Frank Farrar and his friends were
down pood and thick on Choteau. getting
30 to 1 for their money. Farrar & Tuber

KENNEL CLUB BENCH SHOW.
Will Occur in May Under an Eastern
Judge.
The annual meeting of the' San Fran
cisco Kennel Club was held yesterday at
the Occidental Hotel, with a large attend
ance of the members. Among those pres
ent were: Henry J/ Crocker, Adolph B.
Spreckels, John E. de Ruyter, Henry H.
Carlton, William Kittle, J. P. Norman,
Mortimer Fitch, Robert Bolton, John G.
Barker, F. G. Skaife, Fred W. Tallant
and W. C. Brown.
John E. de Ruyter presided. The first
business of the evening was the election
of a board of directors, whose number
was by resolution reduced from seven to
five The directors elected were A. B.
Spreckels, Henry J. Crocker, John E. de
Ruyter, William S. Kittle and J. P. Nor
man.
The next proceeding was the re-election
of Captain C. B. Knocker as delegate to
the American Kennel Club, the nominat
ing speeches being profuse in their com
plimentary allusions to his services.
The resignation of Dr. F. W. d'Evelyn
was accepted, with many expressions of
regret, but it was the only course open
to the club, as the doctor has allied him
self to an organization in contravention
of the rules of the American Kennel Club.
The subject of the bench show was then
brought up. and after considerable dis
cussion it was decided that it should be
held during the first week in May or as
near thereto as practicable. An Eastern
judge will be brought out. and the selec
tion will be left to the judgment of the
bench show committee.
The election of the bench show commit
tee was next in order, and the choice of
the club rested on the following gentle
men: John E. de Ruyter, Henry J.
Crocker, William S. Kittle, J. P. Nor
man and H. H. Carlton. A guarantee
fund was subscribed by the members
present, and the meeting adjourned.
The board of directors convened imme
diately, with Mr. de Ruyter in the chair.
The election of officers resulted as fol
lows: President, Adolph B. Spreckels;
first vice president, John E. de Ruyter;
second vice president. Henry J. Crocker;
secretary-treasurer, Henry H. Carlton.
The details of the preliminary work
necessary to the organization of the
bench show were settled and the meeting
adjourned.
Judging from the enthusiasm manifest
ed by the members it will be safe to pre
dict a rousing success for this year's
show.
MRS. REGAN'S CRY TO
HER SISTER ANNIE
DEFENSE IN KENNEDY MUBDEB
CASE COMMENCED.
A Motion to Dismiss After the
Prosecution Bested Is Denied
by the Judge.
The prosecution in the case of Mrs.
Elizabeth Regan, charged with the mur
der of Policeman Kennedy, rested yes
day afternoon and the defense was com
menced. There were only two witnesses
examined for the prosecutionâ Leon E.
Stolz and Joe Foran â both employed at
Michaelson's stables on Ellis street. They
testified to having often seen Mrs. Regan
at the stables looking for Kennedy, and
Foran once saw them having a "spat."
A few days before Kennedy was mur
dered he told Foran that he had a big job
on his hands to get rid of Mrs. Regan,
and he was afraid she would kill him.
Foran admitted that he was an ex-con
vict and went at one time under the name
of Thomas Lloyd.
Attorney Long moved for the dismissal
of the case, as the prosecution had failed
to show that Kennedy was shot in
self-defense, but Judge Graham declined
to grant the motion.
Mrs. Annie Dean, a sister of the defend
ant, was the first witness for the defense.
She testified that on the day of the mur
der she left her house on Falrmount
street to go to a grocery about a block
from 232 Chenery street, and thought she
would call and see her sister. She went
in by t"he side gate and opened the kitchen
door. After closing the door she heard
the noise of a scuffle in the dining room,
and Mrs. Regan screamed to her: "For
God's sake, Annie, come here. Tom Ken
nedy is killing me." She ran out the
back way and across the street to ncr
sister, Mrs. Johnston, and told her that
she heard a scuffle and Kennedy was kill
ing Lizzie. Mrs. Johnston ran across the
street and witness remained on the back
porch of Mrs. Johnston's house until she
returned. Nothing was said by either
about the tragedy.
Mrs. Dean was subjected to a severe
cross-examination by Attorney Barrett,
but she stuck to her story. She admitted
that she said to Captain Gillen and Bar
rett when questioned by them thnt the
words used by Mrs. Regan were "Tom
Kennedy is killing me," but now she was
under oath and told the truth. She ad
mitted that some bedding was taken to
her house from Chenery street on the
night of the stiooting, but that was be
cause Mrs. Regan's little girl went to stay
with her. The prosecution will attempt
to prove that the bedding was taken from
the bed on which Kennedy was sleeping
when they claim he was killed, so that
all trace of blood, if any, could be wiped
out. The case will be continued this
morning.
HESS WINS HIS SUIT
AGAINST THE UNION
THE JUBY AWARDS HIM A
JUDGMENT.
As the Rights of Organized Labor
Are in Question an Appeal to
the Supreme Court Will
Be Taken.
Fred Hess Jr.. who sued the San Fran
cisco Typographical Union to recover $25,
--000 damages for having been forced out
of employment by the union, he being a
non-union man, has won his fight, at
least so far as the Superior Court is
concerned. Yesterday afternoon the jury
before which the case was heard returned
into court and gave judgment in Hess'
favor for the sum of $1200.
AH day Wednesday argument was heard
by the court on a motion made by the
defendant for a nonsuit. Authority after
authority was cited, but the court refused
to grant a nonsuit, and the defendant put
on its witnesses. Then the case was ar
gued and submitted. The jury was out
some time, but finally reached the above
verdict.
The case involved the right of a union
to protect itself from what it termed
"scab" labor and "ratting," the former
being a term applied to a non-union man,
the latter being applied to a union man
who has refused to walk out when a
strike is ordered. It has been held in the
highest English court that a union has a
right to protect itself and its objects.
Whether the Supreme Court will so hold
remains to be seen.
MARDI GRAS BALL.
An Unusual Interest Being Taken in
This Society Event.
Society has aroused Itself for the Mardi
Gras ball to be held at the Mark Hop
kins Institute of Art on the evening of
St. Valentine's day. Up to date fifty-six
gentlemen"s tickets and forty-seven la
dies' tickets have been applied for. This
number is far in excess of any demand
in the preceding years in which such an
entertainment has been given. "Work has
already commenced on two band Ltanda.
One is being erected in the left, end of the
hall and the other in the large window
of the drawing room. The work of deco
ration will not be undertaken until after
Monday, as Sunday is a free day at trje
institute. The decorations will be gor
geous and beautiful. Florists have had
large orders placed with them, and hand
some palms and evergreens will come
from Santa Barbara. Ttifi caterers say
that never before in the history of Mardl
Oras socials have they received so many
orders so long a time previous to the en
tertainment.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. I.â Many specialties made
sharp advances to-day, while the changes in f
the railways were rather mixed. Interest cen- '
tered largely in low priced shocks, as Is shown j
by the dealings of 56.000 r res in Texas Pa
cific and 40,000 in Denver and Rio Grande, which
made extreme advances of 2 points each. At- I
chison preferred, which of late has been a j
bear target, made an advance of about 2 points j
on transactions of 100,000 shares. Among the ;
ether strong stocks were C. C. C. and St. Louis, I
Dcs Moines and Fort Dodge, Manhattan, Mo- |
bile an.] Ohio, Lake Erie and Western and 'â 
Twin City Rapid Transit made average ad- I
vances of 2 points, aside from the last men
tioned, which rose five and lost half of it.
New York, New Haven and Hartford advanced ,
6 points, and New York Airbrake, after an !
initial break of four points, rose 9.
London was a seller on balance of about
35.000 shares, but was a purchaser in the late
dealings. The market locally opened lower
under bear pressure and commission house I
realizations. The reaction reached a point in '
only a Jew shares, which embraced some of |
the specialtiesâ Louisville, New Jersey Central
and C. C. C. and St. Louis. The decline in
standard stocks was checked after fractional i
recessions on the appearance of buying orders, !
which caused a renewed advance, and stand- I
nrd stocks rallied above yesterday's close. I
Sugar was attacked, thus checking the rise ;
elsewhere. Finally, after feverish fluctuations.
Sugar ended with a small gain. The reported j
gold developments in Colorado .ent strength to
Denver and Rio Grande, ona its semi-annual :
statement was also a sur->orting factor. Man- i
hattan's rise was probably on advance Infor
mation of the provisions for a loan for elec- 'â 
trical equipment. The bears as usual sought
to bring about a reaction in the last hour, but
the offerings were well taken, and as soon as â 
pressure was removed the market closed firm. !
The St. Paul weekly statement of gross earn- \
ings, which often, according as they are more
or less favorable have a distinct effect upon j
the market, did not aDpear to-cay, and it was !
said that they would be given out Saturday
night. The bond market maintained a very !
strong tone throughot â  with exceptional
strength In Texas and Pacific seconds. New 1
Haven debentures and Wisconsin Central firsts.
The latter rose 7% to 63Â« but reacted to 65%.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. 1.-The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business was reduced to-day and consols were
dull on the news that a Chinese five per cent
loan of 1.300.000. secured by the Northern rail
ways, will probably be lcsued at the end of the
week.
The American market Is much shrunk. ' Deal
ers who came over from Africans are return
ing thither and nervous bulls sold all morn-
Ing, but New York bought Denver issues and
Atchison, Chesapeake and Union Pacific, and
the close was at the best. I confirm the report '
of the early appearance of the Central Pacific '
reorganization scheme. The assessment will be i
Jlo In exchange for 25 per cent of fours or -'0
of fives, southern Pacific tionds.
Tlntos touched 39% and closed at 39 on large
bear failure in Paris. There was a rise In cop
per of 15 shillings a ton. I hear from a good -
source that the year's output of Rio Tintos
has been taken at 73 to 75. Anaconda's mine
statistics for the fortnight show supplies down
564 tons. The bank has bought 116,000 pounds
in bars, including 75,000 pounds African gold
at 7s 9%d. *

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. Iâ WHEATâ Comparative
firmness at Liverpool, considering the sharp
slump here yesterday, gave wheat a good start.
The weather throughout the winter wheat
country was recognized as being very trying
on the plant, and as the fields were said to
be for the most part bare of snow some ap
prehension under such conditions was favor
able. May opened %@%c higher at 74%Â®75c,
and as there was a disposition on the part
of some shorts to cover the price. touched 75ftc.
The early signs of recuperation In the local
market soon disappeared under the discourag
ing weakness of the New York market. While
at Chicago the price of May showed a %c ad
vance over yesterday's closing price. New York
did not recover more than %c. As the heavy
shorts who had sold May wheat from around
79c showed no Inclination to cover on the early
advance the market was left without support
as soon as a few of the more moderate oper
ators had taken what .profit the Improvement
in prices gave them. The holders of long wheat
loaded down the market with offerings and
May declined quickly to 73% c. That 'figure
brought May within the limit of some orders
for export, and caused enough buying to send
May up to 74%@74%c. where it closed

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Feb. I.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: The wool
market has, on the whole, shown a great Im
provement during the past week. Prices as yet
have shown no advance, it is true, but a firmer
feeling prevails and there has been more busi
ness transacted. ' The cause of improvement
was the report of an advance in the price of
heavy weights by a leading worsted mill and
the possibility that a further advance would
be established on these goods next week. The
bullish feeling is Intensified also by the course
of the London sales, at which prices have ad
vanced about 20 per cent on some lines of
<>rossbrs'ls and fully 5 per cent on merinos.
The month of January was a disappointing
one. The volume of business transacted was
considerably less than last year. The sales
amounted to only 17,882,000 pounds, as compared
with 23,610,000 pounds in 1S!*8. The sales of the
week in Boston amount to 3,396,000 pounds do
mÂ»stie and 770,000 foreign, making a total of
4.666.C00 pounds, against a total of 3,524,000 for
the iirevious week and a total of 4.137,000 for
the corresponding week last year. Sales since
January 1. 1599, amout to 17 552.000 pounds,
against 23.610.000 pounds last year at this time.
LONDON WOOL MARKET.
LONDON, Feb. I.â The first series of the 1899
' wool auction sales closed to-day. Throughout
the series the tone was very strong. It is esti
mated that the home trade secured 53.000 bales,
the Continent 82,000 and America 6000. Nine
teen thousand bales were carried over. The
opening was active at an advance of from 5 to
7 per cent. Subsequently Merinos were in par
ticular request, especially medium and inferior
combining b- the home trade and the Continent.
Prices soon hardened 10 per cent and the ad
vance was maintained until the end. The feat
ure of the sales was the continual spirited Con
tinental demand for fine locks and pieces,
which were about the dearest in the market
throughout. American requirements were
lighter, the demand for well grown and medi
um greasy cross-breds causing a rise of 10 to
15 per cent above the December prices. During
the last day or two operations slackened, but
the eager competition was again evident to-day.
The finer qualities, in sympathy with Merinos,
were strongly supported. principally by the
home trade. Coarse and shabby, also scoured
slips Improved slightly early In the session,
but later there was a slackening in the de
j mand. Withdrawals were more frequent. Cape |
of Good Hope and Natal was In limited sup-;
ply. There was a good request ror these
grades and medium scoured, fleece washed, ad
vanced 7% and snow white greasies 5 per cent.
The number of bales offered to-day was 12,147.

FARE J ..........800WANTS TO SEE HIS MOTHER.
Irving Feldstrick, a Homesick Bou, Looking for
a Passage Back to Austria,
IRVING FELDSTRICK is a very homesick boy, and he would even face
the mighty magnate of the South. r:i Pacific to plead with him to give
him free passage home to Austria to rejoin his mother. He is a bright,
intelligent little fellow. 14 years of age. and aroused the keenest sympa
thy as he told his story to Acting Police Judge Barry yesterday after
noon. He came to this city from Galicia, Austria, about a year ago with
his aunt. Mr:-. Cantor, a milliner at 9:19 Market street, and got employment
in the White House. He lived with his aunt for three or four months and
then wont to live with the mother of another boy who was also employed
in the White House. Recently he was seized with a fit of homesickness,
and as he had no money he decided to give up his job last Thursday and
try hi? luck at getting the position of cabin boy on a vessel going to Aus
tria. He haunted the docks for two days, and some one told him to see
Mr. Huntingdon. His efforts in that direction were not encouraging, and he
was taken in hand by a benevolent society. He was finally taken to the
City Prison and charged with vagrancy. The intention was to send him
to the Boys' and Girls' Aid Society and the case was assigned to Acting
Police Judge Barry's court.
His aunt. Mrs. Cantor, was in court and said the boy would not work,
hut this he indignantly denied. He bad worked steadily until last Thurs
day. and he owed $1 25 for board, which worried him. as he was unable to
pay it. "I want to go home to my mother," he said, "and would go in a
l.oat Â«>r in anything if 1 could only see her again. People have been
kind to me here, but this is not home. If I could only see Mr. Hunting
ton I am sure I could get him to give me free passage."
Dr. Rlley of Alameda happened to be in court and he offered to provide
a home for the boy and give him employment in running errands. Irving
wanted to get to Austria, but after considerable dickering he promised to
go with the doctor and to give him six days' notice when he intended to
leave. He would save up all his money to buy a ticket to take him back
to his mother.

WHAT THEY ARE.
Composition of the Famous New
Food.
A wide spread interest has been cre-
ated among good livers, as to the com-
position of Grape-Nuts, the new food
that has come into popular use of late.
It has long been known to physicians,
chemists and food experts, that the
starchy portion of entire wheat flour
and barley is transformed into a true
and very choice sugar, by the act of
â¢ Intestinal digestion in the human
body. This sugar is identical with,
and is known as grape-sugar, and it. is
in condition for immediate transfor-
mation into blood and the necessary
â structure from which the delicate,
nerve centers are built up.
A food expert of the Postum Cereal
Co., Llm.. Battle Creek, Mich'., followed
a line of experiments until he pro-
duced the food called Grape-Nuts, of
which grape-sugar forms the principal
part, and it is produced by following
out Nature's processes, in a mechani-
cal way.
The new food-has a charming flavor
find can be served instantly either cold
with cream, or, by pouring hot milk or
cream over It, one has a hot mush at
once. - :. â¢ ~ " :
hoard the transport Senator, was taken
ashore yesterday morning- with a bullet
wound in his right breast. The officers
in charge of the troops at once attempted
ock every avenue of information con
cerning the shooting, and were so far suc
cessful as to keep many of the true de
tails of the affair in the shade. Pyre
gives a statement which he avers Is cor
rect, but which is seriously doubted. He
claims that his wound is the result of an
accident, but it is the general belief that
he was shot deliberately and that he is
now endeavoring to shield his would-be
slayer.
Just before the sailing of the transports
three shots are reported to have been
heard by those on the dock and on the
deck of the vessel. They came from be
low, and soon Trumpeter Lovegron, who
did the shooting, was arrested by the
military authorities and the wounded
nwn was taken ashore. None of those
who were present with the principals
would reveal anything, and it appears as
if their ears and eyes must have been
closed. Lovegren simply said it was an
accident and omitted details, and Pyre,
when he was able to talk, made this
statement:
"I was lying on a bunk in the hold of
the vessel and a number of other boys
were lounging about in the same fashion,
l.ovegren had a 44-callber pistol in his
hand and was fooling w.ith it. Sergeant
Wynne told him to put it up, but he re
plied that it was not loaded. To prove
this he pulled the trigger three times.
The first two times it snapped, and after
the third there was a report and I felt
a bullet enter my body. That Is arl I
know about it. It was purely accidental."
The bullet entered under the right nip
ple, ranged downward and was taken out
by physicians at the Presidio Hospital
about un inch from the interior superior
splnous process. The wound is not con
sidered dangerous unless blood poisoning
should result. I,ovegren will be tried by
the military authorities at Manila.
It is a matter of general belief that both
men had been drinklne Tuesday night
and that this affair is but a finale of their
ppree. Some think that the corporal gave
an order whfch was not obeyed and that
a sniffle Immediately ensued, in which
three shots were fir<:d, only one taking
effect.
Pyre is about 27 years of age. and is a
resident of Salisbury. N. C. He enlisted
in the army in the Stato of Tennessee, and
has been all through the Cuban campaign.
He ha? a goou record, and engnged in the
battles of San Juan and Santiago.
THE TRANSPORTS SAIL.
Some Tardy Soldiers Create
a Little Fun at the
Wharf.
The transports Senator and Ohio sailed
for Manila yesterday. There was a llvely
scene immediately after the vessels had
left the wharf, caused by about ten sol
diers, who had transportation, but who
found Utempelve* Still on land. Tuesday
night the regiment which sailed was paid
off. The temptation to patronize the
water frcnt dives and celebrate their de
parture became strong for some of them,
and there was a general stampede over
the vessels' sides. The men proceeded
to lay the foundation for a glorious? spree,
and many of them failed to return at the
hour set for departure. They put in an
appearance later, however, and sighted
the transports out in the stream. With
war whoops and wild gesticulation they
attracted the uttention of those on board
and \Vhltehall boats were lowered to
gather them in. Most of these had not
vet recovered from the effects of their
interior moistening and were dragged on
deck by means of ropes, after a manner
by which the anchor is handled.
Some were left entirely, and two of
them, who were afraid to show up at the
Presidio and who were "hrokr\" request
ed Sergeant Tom Mahoney at the ferry to
take charge of them. He refused to do
so. and they succeeded In securing a per
mit to yint the City Prison by smashing
windows on East street. They were ar
rested by Officer Mackey. Another one
says he had no intention of going with
the ship and thinks San Francisco a good
location for the present.
A singular coincidence in the vote
against Congressman Kirkpatrick in Pike
County. Pennsylvania, is noted by a local
newspaper. The majority against him was
always the same, c(2l. In each year's elec
tion of 1894, 1896 and 1898. '

Incident in the First
Fennell Suit.
SECOND READY FOR TRIAL
ANSWER WAS NOT MADE, SO
DEFAULT WAS ENTERED.
Mrs. Fiske-Marceau-Fennell Will
Soon Be Free From the Man
Who Pursued Her When
She Fled.
The default has been entered in the ac- i
tion of Mrs. Amanda J. Fennell for a di- i
I voice from her husband, Gerald M. Fen
i nell. To-day a commissioner will be ap- j
! pointed to examine the witnesses In the
case and a few brief weeks will see petite i
but fascinating Mrs. Fiske-Marcoau-Fen- j
I nell free to bare her heart again to Cv-
I pid's shafts. When the final decree of
; court is entered Mrs. Fennell will have
: cast off the bonds that have long held j
' her to a man she never loved although I
' she cast aside happiness to become his I
; wife, it was her self will that led her to
this obnoxious union, but a few brief
weeks of discontent cleared her mind, i
and then her efforts to undo what she
i had done are worthy of description from
j the pen of De Rostand for the dramatic
and Twain for the humorous.
It was not so long ago when the couple
I entered a little church in New York City
i and were wedded. Then they came to
| the West, and a month after the cere-
I mony found them in San Francisco, lo
cated In the Palace Hotel. One evening
Fennell returned to his rooms and silence >
i greeted him. His wife had flown, where :
;he did not know. While a multitude |
and the anxious husband searched '
I through the night the little wife was en- â 
j Joying herself, sipping her black coffee. !
j and musing all alone In a superb suite of i
: rooms in the second Moor of the Cliff i
I House. Fennell finally located her and !
. from out of the night were heard the !
i sounds of horses" feet and a rumbling '
cab hurrying toward the beach. Fenneil
; arrived at the Cliff House, but his sten- !
torian inquiries as to his wife's where- !
. abouts reached her ears, and, gathering
up her effects, she fled from a side, door.
i She found a carriage, and when her hus- :
! band opened the aoors of the room she j
â  occupied and found that she had gone I
he was overcome. Down the park road I
sped Mrs. Fennell's carriage, and in an 1
hour she was again in her rooms in the ]
â¢ Palace, the doors barred against her hus- ,
band. At the gray of morn Fennell re- ;
. turned, tie asked for admittance, but it :
was denied him. Then he pleaded with
tearful voice and was admitted.
Not many days later Fennell contem
f plated a trip to the southern part of the ;
. State. He wanted to make money in the >â 
I insurance business, he said, and asked !
' his wife to accompany him. "If you will j
take your harp and diamonds," he Mid,
"you can entertain those seeking lnsur- j
ance on uncertain life and fire, and while ,
â  you entertain I will reap." The offer
was declined by Mrs. Fennell, and the '*
reason, she afterward explained, was that |
she was fearful that the business ven
-1 ture would prove a failure and necessitate ;
| her "soaking" her entertaining harp and
â  dazzling diamonds to sustain them on
; their journey home.
So the dream of Fennell was shattered,
as were his nerves when a short time ;
later Mrs. Fennell again disappeared and i
a summons in a divorce suit told him that I
1 she was in Fresno and had sought the j
protection of the kindly court. Fennell j
hurried thither and tried to stop proceed
ings. He did not succeeci. The couple
j occupied separate rooms in the Hotel
Hughes, and one moonlight night the ;
: golaen btams fell on the manly torm of
: Fennell, clad in pajamas, coming over the i
window sill of his wife's room. She
awakened with a start and with throat- i
ening whispers ordered her spouse from |
.her presence. "Climb out of the win- i
flow," she said; "get out the way you .
came in." Fennell pleaded. He wanted
: to go, If he must, out through the door; j
'it went against his dignity to dim |
i around in the moonlight in his pajamas, i
1 but as he arrived thusly, thusly must ue
i go. So he went.
Afterward they were seen driving to- j
gether, and when the case was fallen for ;
' hearing a decree was denied Mrs. Fennell
on the ground of collusion. She was not j
disconcerted, however, and the end oi a
few months saw Fennell desert the city
, and his wife. He went to London, but is
i now in Butte City, Montana, it is said, j
He has made no answer to his wife's com- j
plaint, so she will get her decree. In the
meantime Mrs. Fennell sits in her Fresno
' home and laughs merrily when she thinks â 
â¢ of the Cliff HoÂ«sÂ» the moon and pajamas, j
THE LIE GIVEN IN
THE SUMMERS CASE
LITIGANT AND LAWYEE PASS
BITTER REMARKS.
Court Frequenters Expect to See a
Battle, Not of Words but of
Fists, Before the Trial
Ends.
The exchange of sarcastic compliments
that have been tossed back and forth by
Calvin F. Summers and Attorney Joseph
Campbell, who is contesting Summers'
claim to $14,000 on deposit with the Cali
fornia Savings and Loan Society, greatly
to the amusement of the jury, went out
side the usual lines yesterday and Sum
mers accused Campbell of lying and told
the lawyer that he knew he was lying.
The gathering of testimony bearing on
the reputation of Mr. Summers was the
cause of the accusation. George \V. Whit
ney had testified that so far as he knew
the reputation In question was. good, but
on being asked whether he hart ever
heard Summers' reputation discussed he
stated that he had not.
"Did you ever hear that Summers had
been discharged from his position under
Sidney V. Smith for the offense of open
ing his employer's letters?" asked Camp-
e Ãcfore the witness could answer Sum
mers leaned over and said in an audible
tone, "Mr. Campbell, you are lying, and
Campbell turned, but before he could
frame an answer Judge Troutt began to
score Summers for his conduct and said
that if the remark were made for the
DurDose of intimidating counsel or get
ting his views before the jury punishment
should follow.
"I did not mean my remark for the ears
of court or jury," said Summers. "I di
rected it solely to Mr Campbell."
Judge Troutt said he would defer action
in the mattor until another time, which
had the effect of subduing Summers.
Monday Summers went wild, accused
Campbell of leering at him, smiling at
him and making faces at him. He de
manded the protection of the court and
Campbell said. "Your Honor, I have too
much contempt for Summers to smile at
"Not more contempt than I have for
your methods," said Summers, and the
court Interfered. ...
These little disturbances have charac
terized the trial from tl*e outset and the
court frequenters are anticipating a bat
tle royal before the case is finally sub
mitted.
Stallard Is Very Lucky.
W. H. Stallard. who shot and seriously
wounded hie wife in a downtown saloon,
and who has been on trial on a charge of
assault to murder, was convicted of sim
ple assault yesterday.' Judge Dunne ex
pressed surprise at the verdict, but as he
could not determine the case In any other
way. he gave the prisoner the full extent
of the lawâ three months in the County
Jail
DE YOUNG DOES NOT
WANT A COMMISSION
THE Bulletin of yesterday, with its usual accuracy, contained an article,
presumably written in Sacramento, the presumption being based on the
fact that the article bore a Sacramento date line, alleging that M. H.
de Young has requested that he be appointed commissioner to repre
sent California's interests at the Paris Exposition, or as the Bulletin
puts it "to go to the Paris Exposition with a State exhibit." The Bulletin
avers thai Mr. de Young has not only demanded of Governor Gage that he
be appointed a member of the commission, but "thinks it Is his due that he
shall be permitted to name the other two commissioners." In the article it
is also said that it has been said that "General de Young's choice of com
missioners would be De Young, J. A. Filcher and L. H. Valentine of Los An
geles.
As to the article, and to all statements made in the article, Mr. de Young
has an answer. He brands it as false in every particular, and holds that
It was printed with the knowledge that it was false. "At the present time,"
said Mr. de Young last evening, "I have no desire to be appointed commis
sioner to represent California at the Paris Exposition. I have not asked for
such an appointment, neither have I thought of asking for such an appoint
ment. I have not suggested that any one be appointed on that commission
and have not thought of requesting the appointment of any one on that

truth; in fact, It is grossly false."
DR. ALLISON LAVISH
WITH HIS GIFTS
| TEXAS MEDICO SUCCUMBED TO
HIS NAMESAKE'S WILES.
; The Date for His Wedding With the
Willing Widow Had Been
Set.
Dr. Andrew Alexander Allison, for
} twenty-five years a practicing physician
in the staid town of Temple, Tex., parted
with over $2000 after he made the ac
; (juaintance of Mrs. Grace Allison, whom
I he met through the good â or bad â offices
â of Bain's matrimonial agency. When the
I physician stalked into the District Court
room, grave, dignified and ministerial,
yesterday, it sent a thrill of surprise
through the defendants, for little did they
think that the Government would bring
him all the way from the Lone Star State
to testify against them Dr. Allison would
be the last man in the world whom the
casual observer would take for a man
j who had been fleeced by the questionable
; methods of marriage fakers. He is ap
! parently intelligent, but when he acknowl
' edged parting with the trinkets belonging
j to his dead wife and mother for a female
: - trickster he lost the sympathy of the au
| ditors, and it looked as if he entered the
scheme in the hope of getting a share of
the $35,000 which the Allison person repre
j seated herself as being worth.
He told the old story of the personal,
' his letter in reply and the receipt of the
; circulars, the parting with the prelimin
ary $5 as a registration fee and of the
j correspondence with the fair widow; how
I he finally came to this city on March 30
I last at her request, and in keeping with
I liis own feelings in the matter, for be it
! known that the doctor was serious in his
! intentions of marrying her.
He began his courtship the day after
! his arrival, and became formally en
-1 gaged to the enslaver of his love on April
, 5, the date of the wedding being set for
September 7. Then the wooer, who should
bave known better, commenced to unload,
| and be fairly deluged his namesake with
! presents. The list comprised a diamond
j cluster ring, cost $425: gold watch, $100:
! diamond brooch. $SSK; earrings, breast pin
I and locket. $165. the joint property of his
â¢ first wife and his mother, and a variety of
other article's. He returned home on April
13. and the wily Grace was not chary ahout
i asking htm for gifts in her letters, as in-
I stanced by her request for a revolver,
1 which he sent her. She had a decided
BUCKLEY PRESCRIBED
A RIGHT-ARM SWING
THE action instituted by Dr. C. F. Buckley against Capitalist James V.
Cnleman to recover $11,600 for medical services rendered is progressing
merrily before Judge Hunt. It developed yesterday that in addition to
being a physician Dr. Buckley is also a scrapper.
Cnloman was grievously ill for some months, and the attack af
fected his mind. On one occasion. Dr. Buckley testified yesterday, when he
went to visit his patient at Sausalito Coleman was out of bed. The sick
man had evidently been reading of some famous prize-fight, for on the
arrival of the physician Coleman immediately suggested that they put on
the gloves that the physician might learn how the mystic solar plexus blow
was delivered. Dr. Buckley is well along in years, but still in vigorous
health.
After exacting a promise from Coleman that he would not hurt him. Dr.
Buckley put on the gloves. Coleman made a lunge and jammed the wind
out of the doctor.
"My blood raced through my veins," said Dr. Buckley, "and when I re
covered I landed on Coleman's nose and the blood spurted."
"And that is how you made your $11,600 fee. Is it?" put in W. W. Foote.
who represents Coleman. Dr. Buckley made no answer and shortly left the
stand.
F. E. Goodban. a trained nursÂ«, was next called, and he proved a joy for
ever. Without cause he would appeal to the court, and on occasion en
deavored to hurt Foote's feelings by branding him as the best cross-examiner
in I'alifornia. Goodban finally found a chance and made his exit. The crowd
enjoyed the day's fun, and to-day will again congregate in anticipation of
further joy. â¢ â¢ '

preference in this regard, and wrote that
she was sorry he had not sent her another
brand of easier action. He also sent her
a trunkful of wearing apparel, value un
known, which had also belonged to his
first wife, and she further asked him to
send her a writing desk By express, which
he could not get in the trunk.
She also ' taxed his love," as she put it,
by asking 1 him for a diamond engagement
ring given to him by his former wife, but
she did not get that in her clutches, for
the doctor had it on in the courtroom.
Then she had a decided predilection for
flowers, and she chided him often for not
sending her some from a florist whose
name she carefully wrote in her letter.
At the time of adjournment they were
not through with the medical dupe, and
he will go on the stand again to-day
The other witness called was Frederick
Sheck, who has been confined in the
County Jail for four months, the authori
ties fearing he would run away. He was
a victim, and after he became acquainted
with Mrs. Allison gave her a $175 engage
ment ring. . They went to the Palace
Baths for a swim, and after they came
back to Bain's office she said she had lost
it In swimming. Sheck confessed that
he was foolish enough to go to look for
the ring.
He testified that he received $150 back
from Bain, and the prosecution endeav
ored to show that this was in the nature
of a compromise with the schemers to
square the case. In answer to the ques
tion whether Mrs. Allison had ever refused
to marry him, Sheck replied that one day
she had shoved her fist in his face and
told him never to set foot in her house
again. He considered this something in
the nature of a refusal.
WALLS COMING DOWN.
Ropes Once More at Work on the
Baldwin Ruins.
It remained for the wind and the Fire
Department to convince Baldwin that the
unsightly heap of ruins, formerly his ho
tel, Ifl insecure and should be removed.
Yesterday portions of the walls swayed
in the wind, and loosened boards, flopping
tin and timbers blew down among the
pedestrians on M-arket and Powell streets.
The Fire Department has been watching
the work of clearing? out the interior for
some time, and it has been observed that
while support has been taken away from
the walls no disposition has been "shown
to take them down. Yesterday Fire Mar
shal To we ordered the windlasses on the
scene onre more, and under his supervis
ion a portion of the Powell-street wall
was dragged into the interior. When these
are down more of the Market-street wall
will follow.

MAY LEAVE
THE OFFICE OF
MAYOR OPEN
Democrats Have No
Programme.
DAVIE MAY BE NAMED
SOME DELEGATES IN FAVOR OF
R. W. SNOW.
The Annexed District Believes That
It Should Have Proper Repre
sentation in the City
' Council.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Feb. 1.
The divided Democracy is at a loss for
n candidate for Mayor. Many proposi
tions are now being considered in antici
pation of the convention to-morrow night,
and after all it is not unlikely that no
nomination will be made for the head of
the ticket.
There are many delegates In favor of
Indorsing the candidacy of John L. Davle.
There Is some opposition to him on the
part of those who favor the appointment
of straight Democrats for all the offices or
of leaving spaces plank for which no
straight Democrats are nominated. There
is a feeling among another section of the
delegates that it might be good policy to
Indorse R. W. Snow, though, of course,
this radical proposition meets with much
condemnation. Then, again, there Is the
element that is always spoiling for a
fight and which does not care very much
who is put up so long as there is pros
pect of a keen contest during the cam
paign.
To-morrow night the adjourned conven
tion will meet to finish Its work. The
committee on platform and resolutions
has completed its labors and declares
that it is ready to produce a platform
that cannot fail to favorably impress
every voter in this city. H. C. McPike,
although not a delegate, has prepared a
plank relating to the water question, and
Seth Mann of the committee of twenty
one has seen to it that good roads shall
not suffer at the hands* of the Democracy
If he can help it. Last night the com
mittee on platform was about ready to
ri port when it was called to its attention
that it had pledged its nominees to sev
eral reforms and improvements. As no
pledges prior to election can now be put
In platforms it was found necessary to
remodel the document.
It is said that to-morrow evening there
â will be few vacant seats in the conven
tion. The reason for so many absentees
last niyhi was declared to be that the
delegates were all informed that no nom
inations would be made till Thursday
night, ami that, therefore, they were not
particular about attending.
"The indorsement of Snow for Mayor,"
said a Democratic leader to-day, "would
hardly be good policy. The "Municipal
League, which is supposed to be non-par
tisan, did not put any Democrats on its
ticket, and therefore I do not see why we
should take up its candidate. Some
friends of Davie have expressed a desire
that he be indorsed by us, but this would
not be good policy, because Davie is not
a Democrat, and our chief kick against
the old Democracy was that it used the
party in -this county to assist certain Ke
publican candidates, to the detriment of
Democrats. It is very probable that the
position may be left vacant, although
there is a possibility that there may be
enough Davie votes in the convention to
carry him through. The delegates are
absolutely unpledged, and when we meet
every good Democrat will have an oppor
tunity to have his claims presented and
ask for a nomination."
The large annexed district, which it is
generally conceded will not be separated
from this city by the effect of any ap
peal now pending in the courts, is making
a hard fight for representation in the new
Council. This district has paid during
the past year over $35,000 in taxes Into the !
city treasury. For this it has so far re- I
ceived a few police officers and a few
electric lights. It is anxious to have its
fair share of all municipal privileges, and
for this reason is anxious to secure one â 
of the four Councilmen at large. As it
Ik the largest individual ward in the city
It is certainly entitled to two member!
In the Council. The residents have pinned
their faith on C. A. Chtchester of Golden
Gate, who has been nominated by both
the Republicans and Municipal League.
Mr. Chichester is one of the leading spir
its in the annexation movement, and his
neighbors are now anxious to reward him
by sending him to the Council.
SAVED FBOM STARVATION.
Charity Displayed Behind Priscn
Bars for Frank T. Homer's
Family.
OAKLAND, Feb. I.â But for the charity
displayed by prisoners at the County Jail
in sacrificing their appetites and giving
up a portion of their rations the past few
days, Mrs. F. T. Homer and her four
little children, residing at 764 Madison
street, would be starving. The husband
and father Is awaiting trial on a charge
of embezzling a printing press, with which
bogus lottery tickets were printed for
Rbout four years. He has been in the
County Jail about three weeks, and since
that time the mainstay of the family's
support has been lacking, and the unfor
tunate family have, moreover, received
notice to vacate their home because of
failure to pay the rent.
Their case, probably overlooked unin
tentionally by local charitable societies,
has been taken up by the prisoners at the
bounty Jail, who each day lay aside a
part of their meals to appease the hunger
of their fellow-prisoner's family. The
prisoners obtained permission of the jailer
to eend out a basket of food every day.

COMPANY F
RETURNS AND
IS UNHONORED
No Public Welcome
for the Boys.
SOME ARE DISAPPOINTED
OTHER CITIES HAVE SET A DIF
FERENT EXAMPLE.
Believe They Should Be Honored as
Much as Though They Had
Faced Mauser Bul
lets. *
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 1.
Much surprise and some indignation is
being expressed that the old Company F,
which went in the regular service last
autumn, should have been honorably
mustered out and returned to Oakland
without any public notice being taken of
the incident.
The Oakland boys returned home from
Benicia last Saturday without any effort
at giving them a welcome or showing
any recognition of the unselfish manner In
which they decided to take up arms and
go anywhere for the honor of their coun
try. It Is stated that it Is no fault of
theirs that they did not see active service
on either side of the globe, and that they
are deserving of at least a public re
ception at the hands of the people of this
city.
In many of the other cities of California
where the returned companies now are
they have been handsomely treated and
made to feel that their services were ap
preciated. In contrast to this is the in
significant manner in which Oakland's
soldiers came home, went about their
usual avocations, with nobody to extend a
welcoming hand or give them a pat on the
back.
When the boys marched into Camp Bar
rett last fall, many promises were made
of the generous manner in which they
would be received when honorably dis
charged from the service at the close of
the war. These promises have not been
kept, and so far no effort has been made
to fulfill them.
BRANDES IS DENIED
A CHANGE OF VENUE
ACCUSED WIFE'S TRIAL ALSO
SET FOR FEBRUARY 7.
Attorneys Intimate That the Trial
of Mrs. Brandes Will fie First
Disposed Of.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Feb. 1.
William A. Brandes and his wife, Etta
Brandes, both charged with the brutal
murder of their 15-year-old daughter Lil
lian, will be tried in this county. Judge
Hall having denied a motion for a change
of venue.
Mrs. Brandes appeared in court this
morning to plead "not guilty" and her
trial was set for February 7, the same
day of her husband's trial. While the
accused couple sat chatting and laughing
the motion for a change of venue in W.
A. Brandes' case was argued by Attor
neys Sawyer and Bennett.
It was contended by the defense that
Brandes could not get a fair and Impar
tial trial here because of the prejudice
that had been created by a yellow press
against the accused.
Judge Hall in denying the motion called
attention to the area of Alameda County
with its 100,000 population, and said he
felt confident that out of this population
twelve men could be found who would try
the case Impartially. Commenting on the
claim that prejudice had been created by
the press. Judge Hall called attention to
the fact that reports and details of the
horrible crime had appeared In all the San
Francisco papers and circulated through
out the entire State.
The court also denied a motion granting
the defense authority to engage physi
cians and surgeons as expert witnesses to
be paid by the county.
The date of Mrs. Brandes' trial was set
for February 7 at the request of the de
fense. Attorneys Sawyer and Bennett
stating that if on that day W. A. Brandes
might not be ready for trial, the trial of
the accused woman might go ahead, and
they expressed themselves implicitly con
fident of an acquittal in short order in
her case.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1899.
CONFESSED HIS
GUILT, YET HE
WAS ACQUITTED
Charged With Burg
lary, Sims Freed.
A JUROR'S PECULIAR REASON
INSTRUCTIONS HIS INTELLI
GENCE COULD NOT GRASP.
Wit Ward, Who Held Up a Saloon
Han for Five Dollars, Sentenced
to Six Years in
Prison.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 1.
There Is no accounting for the action
of juries. To the surprise of everybody,
particularly his attorney, C. J. Sims,
charged with burglarizing the residence
| of John D. Nelld in Alameda last Novem
ber, was acquitted by a jury in Judge
Hall's court to-day.
The jury was made up of John Seebeck,
E. E. Walcott, B. S. Marsion, W. P. Lem
on, H. Furst, William Peru, George An
drews, H. W. Bronson, N. W. Jacobs, J.
Dovan, W. T. Gibbs and George W. Man
uel.
Sims is a colored man, and was called
to the witness-stand by his attorney, D.
M. Connors, when he frankly confessed
that he had entered Nelld's home for the
purpose of getting a drink of water; but
that after he got into the house he broke
open an inner door with a hatchet and
carried off a demijohn of claret, some
wearing apparel and a guitajr. This testi
money of his self-confessed 'and supposed
burglarious conduct was corroborated by
numerous witnesses, one of whom, Mrs.
G. A. Severance, testified that he nail
brought the stolen articles to his house,
informing her thai he had secured them
at the house where he was working.
In his Instructions to Uje jury Judge
Hall advised that if Sims did not intend to
commit a felony at the time he entered
Neild's house the crime would not- be bur
glary, but that if after he had entered lie
had stolen any articles it would be con
strued as larceny; but that if after enter
ing he had then broken open an inner
door, the charge of burglary would stand.
Whether the intelligence of the jury
was not keen enough to grasp this dis
tinction is not known. However, after
twenty minutes' deliberation the jurors
brought in a verdict of "not guilty," to
the surprise of everybody, even Attorney
D. M. Connors for the defense. ~tjne of
the Jurors intimated that the reason of
the verdict was that the jury did not
grasp the meaning of the instructions, and
then, too, the articles stolen wore not of
sufficient value to warrant a conviction.
Sims, when tf*? result was announced,
thanked his attorney for his charitable of
fices and quickly left the courtroom, leav
ing undisturbed the demijohn, guitar and
wearing apparel which he was accused of
having stolen.
In disgust and with some reluctance
Mr. Nleid gathered up these exhibits, for
i since the colored man had not been found
i guilty of having stolen them he was in
doubt as to who the owner might be.
In clear contrast to the foregoing case
is that of Wit Ward, who was arrested
recently on a charge of standing up a
Pleasanton saloon-keeper and robbing
him of $5. Last Wednesday Ward was al
lowed to plead guilty to grand larceny
and to-day he was sentenced to six years'
imprisonment in San Quentln.
Mrs. Metcalf's Will Filed.
OAKLAND. Feb. I.â The holographic
will of Sarah P. Metcalf. who died in San
Francisco last August, was filed for pro
bate late this afternoon, and her son.
Congressman Victor H. Metcalf, peti
tioned for letters of administration. The
will, dated July 2S, 1898, names petitioner
as executor, who, with Jennie P. Robson,
Sarah C. Beam and William J. Metcalf,
the other three children, are devisees.
The estate Is bequeathed to the children
share and share alike.
Intimation of Malpractice.
OAKLAND, Feb. I.â The death of Mrs.
Amy Stanley Tigner. wife of Jonas Tig
nrr, which occurred at her home, 484
Edward street, yesterday, will be Investi
gated by Coroner Mehrmann and a jury.
The deceased was aged 30 years, and ap
parently was in good health. When the
undertaker had laid the body out It was
found that the death certificate had not
been signed, and it is intimated now that
the death was due to malpractice.
Pioneer Engineer's Death.
OAKLAND, Feb. I.â Joseph Payne, the
pioneer engineer of this State, for many
years In the employ of the Southern Pa
cific Company, died yesterday at his
home in Fruitvale. He had been on the
retired list for the ~ast fifteen years. He
was a widower, aged 74 years.
THEY REFUSED TO "DIVVY."
Stanley Sues Messrs. Dingee and
Moffitt for Profits From Water
Stock.
OAKLAND, Feb. 1.-Ex-Public Adminis
trator James Stanley has filed suit against
W. J. Dingee, Frank Moffitt and the Liv
ermore Water and Power Company for
the recovery of a share In $50,000 realized
some time ago from a sale of bonds Issued
by the corporation defendant, of which
amount plaintiff alleges the corporation
received but half, the other half being
divided between Dingee and Moffitt.
Plaintiff bases his claim for a $2500 share
upon an agreement entered into between
himself and Messrs. Dingee and Moffltt
by the terms of which he turned over
to them his 200 shares of the capital
stock in the corporation.
Plaintiff asks that his 200 shares or
their equivalent, which he alleges is $10,
--000, be returned to him; also that it be
decreed that the corporation has no right,
interest or title to tne money referred to
or his 200 shares; that he be given judg
ment against Messrs. Dingee and Moffltt
for $25,000, and that they he required to
deliver to him ten bonds or their equi%'a
lent, $5000.
Stanley is represented' by Attorneys W.
Kaufman, Michael Mullaney and A. A.
Moore.
THOSE LIQUOR ADS.
Students Will Keep Them Out of the
College's Annual Publication.
BERKELEY, Feb. I.â There will be no
liquor advertisements in the Blue and
Gold to be published this term by the
junior class of the University of Califor
nia. This is the decision of the editors
and business managers of the college an
nual, and they are supported in the stand
they have taken by a majority of the
members of the junior class.
Previous to the publication of last year's
book business managers of the annual had
found ready advertisers among liquor
dealers who supplied the columns with
advertisements to the value of almost $200.
The Young Men's and Young Women s
Christian associations of the university en
tered upon an active crusade against the
advertisements a year ago and succeeded
in having them kept out of the '99 Blue
and Gold by themselves securing enough
other advertisements to make good the
difference.
George Brehm, manager for this year,
has himself inaugurated the policy of
doing without financial assistance from
liquor dealers, and expects to make good
the difference In other ways.
HARPER WILL COME
TO VISIT BERKELEY
Chicago's President Will Speak at the
University of California's Char-
ter Day Celebration.
BERKELEY, Feb. I.â The charter day
exercises to be held this year at the Uni
versity of California will be marked by
the presence of a distinguished educator
from the East, Dr. William R. Harper,
president of the University of Chicago.
Charter day, which falls on March 23,
Is celebrated every year by the Berkeley
faculty and student body in commemor
ation of the day on which the univer
sity's charter was granted. The exercises,
Which usually consist of speeches by
members of the faculty and student body,
will be modified this year under the di
rection of President Kellogg in order to
make the event of greater academic im
portance. Presiuent Kellogg reserved a
place on the programme for an address
by some celebrated public speaker. The
Invitation to deliver this address was ex
tended to President Harper, who in a let
ter just received by President Kellogg,
announces that he will come to California
toward the end of March and will be pres
ent at the university's charter day cele
bration.
AN OWNER FOR THE ARM.
Ed Williams, a Medical Student,
Clears Up the Mystery.
ALAMEDA, Feb. I.â The mystery of the
amputated arm found Sunday in an empty
boxcar at West Alameda was in a
measure cleared away to-day. Edward
Williams, a medical student, residing on
Encinal avenue, stated to Deputy Coroner
Fowler that the grewsome bones were
his property and had been stolen from
him on the narrow-gauge train last Satur
day night. He exhibited a receipt show
ing that he had purchased and paid for
the human fragments at a medical col
lege in San Francisco.
Williams said he brought the uncanny
parcel from San Francisco last Saturday
night. When he boarded the train at the
pier he put the bundle on the seat beside
him. Just after passing Pacific uvenue
station he noticed that it had disappered.
He demanded possession of the amputated
arm, but Deputy Corner Fowler referred
him to Coroner Mehrmann.
Harmonic Hall Politics.
ALAMEDA, Feb. I.â The Harmonic Hall

The Meter Leaked.
ALAMEDA, Feb. I.â J. Agnews. local
metercnnn of the Oakland Gas, Light and
Heat Company, was severely burned
about the face and hands this morning
by an explosion of gas on the premises of
A. L. Fisher, 2418 Encinal avenue. The
meter at the place was leaking, and not
thinking that a great amount of gas had
escaped, Agnew crawled under the build
ing and lighted a match. Instantly there
was an explosion that startled the neigh
borhood and dazed the meterman. With
much difficulty he extricated himself from
his perilous position and was taken to his
home in Oakland. His injuries are ex
tremely painful but not serious.
Another Narrow Gauge Accident.
ALAMEDA, Feb. I.â There was another
slight accident on the narrow-gauge line
this morning, but fortunately no one T#as
injured. Engine 15. attached to the Los
Gatos train, broke a side rod just after
leaving Newark. The train was Under
considerable headway, and the broken rod
tore out part of the' under section of the
cab before the engine was brought to a
standstill. All the woodwork beneath the
engineer's position was splintered, but
both men on the engine escaped without
a scratch.
Water Heater Explodes.
ALAMEDA, Feb. I.â The hot water
boiler in the residence of Lord Alfred
Scott. Encinal avenue and Court street,
exploded this morning with great force,
wrecking the celling of the kitchen and
deluging the ceiling of the room with
scalding water. No one was in the apart
ment at the time. The top of the water
heater had parted from the rivets that
held it to the boiler and was found in
the attic of the house, having been blown
through the ceiling. Mr. Scott does not
know how to account for the accident.
James Hogan Missing.
OAKLAND. Feb. I.â James Hogan of
Sixth street has been missing since last
Friday and his family fear that he has
met with foul play. At any rate they do
not believe that he is absent of his own
free will. No reason is assigned for his
disappearance.
He Is Now Sergeant Bush.
As predicted in yesterday's Call Police
man Charles P. Bush was promoted to
be sergeant yesterday to fill the vacancy
caused by the promotion of Sergeant

and efficient officer. He has been as
signed to Captain Wittman's division.

list without pay. In all 135 changes have
been made in transfers, degradations and
dismissals. The Board of Education gives
its promise that not the slightest tinge of
favoritism Will mar Its future action. The
changes that have already been made are
exclusively upon a chronological basis.
Favorites have been ignored and teachers
have had all an equal show.
The board now declares that future
promotions In the department will be
made absolutely upon a chronological
basis. The name and the date of each
substitute and unassigned teacher are
public property. When promotions are
announced the public will be able to de
termine for itself whether or not the
board keeps its promise and promotes
teachers according to the date of their
appointment to the board.
Teachers that have been dismissed will
fight in the courts for reinstatement.
Many that were degraded in rank will
also institute legal proceedings to recover
the positions taken from them.
A preliminary meeting of deposed
teachers was held yesterday afternoon at j
the Longworth Hotel, 532 Geary street. It <
was determined by those present to test i
the authority of the Board of Education ;
in court. Great reliance will be placed in l
the decision of the Supreme Court in the I
Kennedy case. Efforts will also be made I
to establish the contention that the last i
meetings of the last Board of Education |
were legal. At these meetings many reg- !
ular teachers were elected. This election |
has been set aside by the present board j
and the courts will be asked to decide the !
issue.
When teachers were called upon yester
day to give up their classes many refused i
to do so. This step was taken simply to
gain the technical advantage of legal" re- i
Blstance to the action of the board. !
When the cases are heard In court note
of this fact will be made and considered. ;
The salary problem in the department is |
still one of extreme complication. The I
School Directors cannot legally reduce
the salaries of teachers regularly em
ployed. This obstacle has been overcome,
however, by withholding from each
teacher a certain percentage of her sal
ary. The money thus withheld will never.
In all probability, be repaid and will rep
resent a practical reduction in salary.
Rumors have been afloat that the board
Intends to retain 20 per cent of all sal- !
aries for the rest of the fiscal year. This, i
however, is not at present the intention
of the board. It Is expected that salaries
for this month will be paid in full.
At the next meeting of the board the
scheme of retrenchment and reform will
be carried still further. Useless vice princi
pals will be removed and a considerable
saving; effected. It is not likely that sew
ing teachers will be disturbed, although
the rule of economy may result in the
abolition of the department of sewing
After these changes have all been made
the School Department will then be, it is
believed, in a normal condition, with a
proper relation existing between teachers
and pupils. As the need for teachers in
creases new teachers will be taken from
the roll of substitutes. As vacancies oc
cur in the substitute list they will be
filled by young ladies now on the unas-
Blgned lists.
If Superintendent Webster, when he en
tered into the work of straightening out
the School Department, had any concep
tion of the task before him he Is an offi
cial of no little courage. If he had not
wonted out the problem of reclasslflca
tlon of schools, teachers and pupils in
advance, with the solution clear before
him when he blue-penciled the first insti
tution or educator into nothingness, he is
to use a modernism, "up against it." All' :
the pupils of an abolished concern with
the entire population reaching to the
farther bounds of fhe neighborhood are
protesting. Every teacher o f a lost class ;
âwith her klnfolk, is memorializing the
Individual members of the Board of Edu- I
cation for revision. The roads of all com
plaints end in the Superintendent's office
and all day long the anterooms of that
apartment hum like a hive. The visitors !
sit In line, as It were, and from time to i
time they are admitted to the place of
appeal. I
The MlsElon commercial class difficulty
that threatened to assume huge propor
tions, seems to have worked itself out
to an easy solution. All the pupils may I
enter the. Polytechnic on easy terms, and I
twenty-five of them have signified their
Intention of taking up an academic
course In that school.

These teachers are E. J. Gallagher, Mrs.
Bpencer and Mlsb Regan, a sister of ex-
Director Regan, They being High
School teachers, cannot well be placed
unless some educators of the same grade
are crowded out. Gallagher Is reported
to be an able educator and may find a
place somewhere. Mrs. Spencer and Miss
Kegan. being considered only special
teachers, will probably be unassigned.
The building committee of the board
was told yesterday by Chairman Hol
brook of the finance committee that the
desired $71,000 worth of repairs must be
trimmed down one-half before the
''want" will even be heard. About $20,000
for plumbing and. $10,000 for painting will
go out of the budget of expenditures It '
will only be on a showing of absolute
necessity if the building committee gets
$25,000 for repairs. Director Holbrook
has consulted with Building Inspector
George \\alker and h.s lowest estimates
only will be accepted.
The question or the Normal School
diplomas Is yet in an unsafe condition.
The Board of Education in leaving the
school standing till June to be supported
by the contributions of the pupils is
determined to consider it as a private' In
stitution. Consequently the certificates
of graduation will have nn legal value us
teachers' credentials. This fact has been
denied, but will be found correct notwith
standing.

rTHE annual reception by Califor-
I nia Commandery No. 1, Knights
* Templar, to their lady friends, took
place at Golden Gate Hall last
evening. The reception was from ev
ery point of view a most gratifying
success and reflects great credit oti
those gentlemen who had it in charge.
The hall was beautifully decorated for
the occasion. The foyer was a bower
of ferns, while from the ceiling were
suspended red lanterns. These were
hung from suspended coils of white
and red roses. The ballroom where the
festivities of the evening took place
was a dream of decorative creation.
The orchestra was hidden from sight
on the stage by an Immense screen *of
tropical plants. Around the Bldi
the hall were entwined bright colored
bunting, while from the ceiling was
suspended an immense canopy, from
which hung a number of white doves.

ple called very early to learn the truth
of the report. Henry F. Fort man. the
president of the organization, emphatical
ly denied that any such combine had been
made so. far as his company was concern
ed. He stated that his association has not
purchased a dollar's worth of the Can
neries' Association stock and will not.
His concern is In business on its own
account and will not form any part of a
pool or combine, and further he has no
knowledge of the plans of the other
canneries association. In order to em
phasize his remarks he sent the following
dispatch for pulication in the north.
To-day's Examiner publishes an Astoria tele-

art was employed to enrich and en
hance the beauty of the scene.
It was 9 o'clock before the guests
began to arrive. When they had all
assembled the grand march was led
by Commander John P. Fraser. This
was one of the most beautiful fea
tures of the evening. At its conclusion
those present indulged in dancing un
til nearly midnight, when supper was
announced.
The exorcises during the supper
served greatly to enhance the pleas
ure of the evening. While the guests
were being assigned to their seats the
orchestra played "The Stars and
Stripes Forever"; then a prayer was
offered by Rev. Edward B. Church.
After this the guests took their seats
and Comamnder John P. Fraser gave
ttxTii an address of welcome. His re
marks were pointed and happy in
tin It nature.
A delightful and extensive menu was
s< rved, and during the banquet there
were rendered two numbers by the

also two numbers by the quartet
of the same commandery. During the

Fong Suey Wan,, the procuress, who es
caped from the Chinese Bureau last Sep

Moore, according to Chief Meredith, and
by fault of Chief Meredith If one Is to
believe Major Moore, is at present safe at
home in her native land. She left here
about the middle, of .October, but was not
booked as a passenger on any of the
steamers. The lady started as freight.
Snugly packed in a wooden box she was
billed as "one case of merchandise," and
knowing one.s on the steamer handled the
case with care, according to the warning
painted on Its front.
The procuress was held by the Immi
gration Bureau for not having a certifi
cate, but before this charge was investi
gated it was discovered that she was a
noted procuress. While held at the Mis
sion a number of the slave girls Identi
fied her as the wife of Kwong Leung, the
former partner of Little Pete, and they
told Chief Meredith that she was the
woman who had brought them to this
country. Investigation of the charge
against Suey Wan for having landed ille
gally proved that she had a certificate,
and this was known by both Moore and
Meredith.
The woman was taken before Commis

no case against the woman. On the after

leased. Meredith was aware of the fact
that the case would cpme up at that time,
but was not present in the court room.
Major Moore was not on very friendly
terms with the chief at the time of the
escape, and those friendly to Meredith
claim that the major knew that the wom
an would be released and could have pre
vented it, but refrained from doing so, as
the blame for the escape of the woman
would all fall upon Meredith.
Very little effort was made by Chief
Meredith to locate the missing Suey Wan
until several days after her escape. The
severe criticism the chief .received from
the Federal authorities and scathing ar
ticles in the papers spurred him to at
tempt to find her. He went to friends and
asked them to help him out of a tight
fix. At their suggestion he offered a re
ward of $100 for information as to her
hiding place. This offer was made known
to men familiar with Chinatown and
every effort was made by them to secure
the reward. Fong Suey Wan was finally
located ln a basement and the tip was
given to Meredith, but when he ar
rived the bird had flown. For two weeks
the procuress was moved about from
place to place. The first China steamer
which sailed after her escape took her
back to her home.
Fong Suey Wan did not make the en
tire passage to her native land nailed up
in a box. The steamer had no sooner
crossed the bar and was safely outside
the jurisdiction of the Federal authori
ties when, by the judicious use of gold,
one of the lady's friends succeeded in se
curing permission to unbox, the human
freight.

THE DAY AND THE WEATHER.
As stated In yesterday's Call the cold j
wave which visited the State on Tues
day brought very little rain with it. There
were a few spasmodic showers yesterday â¢
morning, and about one-tenth of an Inch
was registered in this city, tapering down j
to one-hundredth of an inch near San j
Luis Oblspo. There was a slight precipl- ]
tation In the Interior, but most of the j
rain fell along the coast.
"It is safe to say," said Professor Ham
mon yesterday, "that the last rain has
run its race, although we might get a lit
tle shower now and then to-night, but not
to amount to anything. To-morrow we
will have partly cloudy weather, but no
rain. The temperature here went as low
as 45 degrees, and the northwest wind
whirh brings in moist air makes the con
ditions unfavorable for frost and conse
quently favorable for crops. The moist
air does not radiate heat rapidly, and
consequently the danger of -freezing is re
duced to a minimum. There have been no
rains In the valley, and the Sierra Moun
tains had six Inches of snow at the sum
mit, making a total fall of between six
and seven inches. The hills back of
Berkeley were white this morning and the
temperature has fallen all over the State."
The rain which did fall will not have
much effeot one way or the other. Of

A Debate on How the People's Rep
resentatives Should Be Elected.
. At the regular meeting of the Conti
nental League last night at Saratoga Hall
the question of how the people's represen
tatives in the United States Senate should
be selected was debated. â¢
The affirmative side was represented by
B. F. McKlnley and H. C.Firebaugh and
the negative by W. J. Herrin and D. V.
Rosenthal. The question was: "That the
United States Senators should be elected
by the popular vote of the people." Mc-
Kinley led off with an argument in which
he J Bh ? wed that the Federal constitution
â had already been amended fifteen times
and one more amendment providing for
the more popular mode of selecting repre
sentatives would not be amiss when it
was taken into consideration that corrupt
methods were being used in forwarding
