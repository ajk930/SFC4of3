LONDON, May it,.â The
Russian Government has de-
cided upon exceptional measures
against the Jews, doubtless ow
ing to the intense feeling against
them prevailing in many parts of
Russia at the present time. The
first anti-Jewish measure was

No exemption will be made
even in the case of French Jews.
There have been serious out-

The n- ters, who were mostly

FRESNO. May 13.â The depot of the
Standard Oil Company, near the north- |
crn limits of the city, was destroyed by J
fire to-night. The conflagration was J
preceded by a terrific explosion, which j
shook the earth for a distance of a half !
mile in every direction. The explosion j
scattered sheets of flame over all the |
surrounding tanks and buildings and
almost instantly the whole depot, cov
ering an acre of ground, was in flames, j
Sheets of fire shot high into the air, |
illuminating the entire city. Every few
minutes explosions occurred which
could be heard miles away. Huge pieces '
of the iron tanks were hurled a dis
tance of two blocks.
The storage depot consisted of four
kerosene tanks, each containing 20,000
I gallons of refined oil. In addition to

W. F. HERRIN WROTE BLACKSTOCK'S
REPORT ON THE GRAIN-RATE CASE
Secret Report
Destroyed and
a New One
Made.
THE secret caucus of the clan
destine meetings of Railroad
Commissioners Blackstock and
I_aumeister and William F.
Herrin at the latter's home are
now public property. The re
creant Commissioners met with the
head of the law department of the
Southern Pacific Company to discuss a
report written by Blackstock on the
"grain case" now pending in the United
States Circuit Court. There is on file
in the office of the Railroad Commis
sion a published report over the signa
ture of N. Blackstock. This report was
not written by Blackstock, but by Wil
liam F. Herrin. The report which
Blackstock wrote was submitted to
Herrin, changed, revised, emasculated
and practically destroyed. It was never
filed and never will be. although its sa
lient features are presented this morn
ing. The original report contains some
startling secret history in reference to
the Southern Pacific Company. It
shows conclusively that the railroad
was eager for the opportunity to com
promise the "grain rate case," to go
before Judge Morrow and ask a dismis
sal. The Southern Pacific Company
wished to submit to the 6 per cent
rate -if the Commission would rescind
the general 25 per cent reduction.
The company was willing to do what
it knew honest men would not do but
which subservient Commissioners have
done. These facts are boldly related
in the secret report which for the first
time finds publication. Soon after the
present Railroad Commissioners were
elected Blackstock was selected to
make- a report on the "grain rate case"
pending in the Circuit Court. Black
stock was given until March 13 to fin
ish his report, but he concluded his
labors on March 3. He then sent cop
ies of his report to William F. Herrin.
Railroad Commissioners Laumeister
and Edson.
In a few days Commissioners Lau
meister, Blackstock and Edson went to
the home of Herrin upon invitation.
Blaekstock's resolution was read and
discussed. Little could be done that
evening, as Commissioner F.ds>>n re-'
fused to submit to the suggestions of
fered by Herrin. Edson was invited to
no more wine suppers at the Herrin
home, but the other Commissioners
were, and night after night considered
Blaekstock's report. Herrin made
changes, eliminated certain passages,
introduced many of his own and prac
tically rewrote the document. This
was done, as a matter of course, with
the unqualified indorsement of Lau
meister and Bla< kstock.
While these meetings were in prog
ress I-aumeister and Edson went to see
M. M. Estee, whose advice they sought
in reference to the grain rate case. It
was then that Laumeister declared
that he would not submit to the sug
gestions of Blackstock. A month later
the dishonest Commissioner submitted
to the dictation of Herrin, which was
immeasurably more humiliating and
dishonest than were the suggestions of
Blackstock, as a comparison between
the secret report and the published
document shows.
Time after time the Commissioners
went to the Herrin home to accept the
changes which Herrin made in Black
stock's report. When the work was
finished the report, as Herrin wrote it,
was adopted, and out of the Herrin re
port grew the scandalous appeal of the
Commissioners to the Circuit Court to
dismiss the "grain rate cases." This
secret report of Blackstock furnishes
another disgraceful episode in the cam
paign of the Southern Pacific Company
to rob the people of the State through
a venal Railroad Commission.
The secret report written by Commis
sioner Blackstock and the other report
revised, enlarged, changed and prac
tically rewritten by William F. Herrin
are almost identical in the opening
pages. Blaekstock's report never saw
the light of public investigation. Her
rin's report was published and filed
over the signature of Blackstock. A
comparison between the two demon
strates beyond the slight.--, doubt how
thoroughly the recreant Commission
ers submitted themselves to the will
of the Southern Pacific Company'
When Blackstock wrote his original re
port it was evident that he still re
tained a sense of truth and was able
to present facts as they exist.
The Commissioner reviewed the
"grain case" in the Circuit Court and
honestly presented its status, with here
and there an allusion to what the
Southern Pacific Company thinks on
the subject. If that part of the report
instead of Herrin's revision and ex
pansion, had been published Judge
Morrow would not have received the
insult bffered to him.
In this part of the report Blackstock
says:
The court, after elaborate arguments
by the Attorney General, associate coun
sel on behalf of the commission, and by
counsel for the complaint, took the mat
ter of the temporary injunction under
advisement, and on November 30, 1896, the
court delivered an elaborate opinion, cov
ering practically the entire case, and or
dered that the temporary Injunction as
to the * per cent grain rate should be
continued, but refused to continue the in
junction as to the 25 per cent horizontal
rate and passenger rates, it having been
made to appear to the satisfaction of the
court that the board did not Intend to
proceed under the 25 per cent laws of the
resolution' without further investigation.
I deem.it to be my duty at this point
to call your attention as briefly as' possi
ble to some of the main issues presetted
by the pleadings, Issues which are of
great importance to the Board of Rail
road Commissioners as now constituted.

â¦ suits in the Circuit Court on condition that the Ranroad Commission would repeal that part of the resolu- â¦

The first twelve paragraphs of the com
plainant's bill contain averments relat
ing principally to the issues based upon
the resolution reducing grain rates S per
cent, and also the 25 per cent general re
duction on freight rates. Counsel for the
Railroad Commission inform me that in
their opinion the 25 per cent horizontal
rate has been by the court finally dis
posed of, but counsel also states that the
complainant, the Southern Pacific j Com
pany, does not at all admit that the 25
per cent horizontal rut has been disposed
of; but it contends that notwithstanding
the court refused to continue the tem
porary Injunction as to that portion of
the resolution,, yet the same is still before
the court and must be considered by the
court on final hearing. I am, however,
of the decided opinion that unless the
Board of Railroad Commissioners, in pur
suance of said resolution, should issue a
schedule of rates in accordance with said
resolution and serve it upon the South
ern Pacific, and attempt to enforce the
same, it has beep finally determined
as far as the Circuit Court is concerned,
and consequently the same is not now a
matter to trouble the commission. . ".-". *.'.".
The thirteenth paragraph of complain
ant's bill relates tee alleged oral threats by
the commission to reduce the rates of
passenger fares. This Issue was also, in
my opinion, entirely disposed of, and is
not now before the court. The fourteenth,
fifteenth and sixteenth averments in the
bill relate to political pledges alleged to
have been made ley Commissioners I.a
Rue and Hinton prior to their election,
all of which were finally disposed of by
the court on the hearing for temporary
Injunction. At any rate such issues are
not likely to trouble the commission as
at present constituted.
William F. Herrin studied these opin
ions very carefully. He decided that
under no condition would they be per
mitted to become public. He therefore
eliminated them from the secret report
and supplied an argument of his own
which is in the published report. Her
rin substituted an \ elaborate , special
plea for th* Southern Pacific Company.
He deliberately misconstrued the de-
HERRIN Well, Here's to Collis ; the People Be D -d. ;
â¢ â¦.â¦ .â¦â¢ â¦'â¦ 'â¦' â¦'â¦*â¦â¢
clsion of the Circuit Court and at one |
of the secret meetings at his home
Blackstock and Laumeister accepted j
the substitution. Herrin's part is in j
the published report and is as follows:
It appears from the arguments of coun-
Bel and the opinion of the court that the
point was hotly contested as to whether
or not the 25 tier cent resolution was such
a final determination of the board as
would Justify an injunction against its
enforcement.
Judge McKenna in his opinion seems in
clined to the view that the resolution, ac
cording to its terms, amounted to a final
determination of the board -to make a
25 per cent reduction In freight rates.
He says: "The language of the resolution
is positive as to the necessity of a reduc
tion and as to the amount.'' -V'v
But in view of the statement in the
affidavits of Mr. La Rue and Mr. Stanton,
that they did not intend the resolution
as a final judgment of the board, and
that they intended thereafter to make a
more definite and particular Investiga
tion before final action, Judge McKenna
says: "I am disposed to accept this as
true and sincere. * Indeed, I do not know
how not to do so, regarding them, as they
must be regarded, as truthful; ; nor do I
care to risk the slightest embarrassment
to them as officers in any proper investi
nation of the complainant or any of its
constituent roads, the results of which
cannot be put in force, even if it was de
sired to. except in a direct and open way,
and the detriment of which, if any, can
be arrested before It fall."
It is evident that -out for the affidavits
of Messrs. Larue and Stanton the 25 per
cent resolution was not final so far as
their action was concerned, the court
would have regarded the resolution ac
cording to its terms, as amounting to
final action, and would have enjoined the
enforcement of the 25 per cent resolution
as well as the S per cent. grain rate reduc
tion. If the board did not intend that this
25 per cent resolution should express their
deliberate judgment to reduce freight
rates generally, according to its terms. it
is unfortunate that the resolution was
ever adopted by the commission, for it is
evident that this litigation has grown
largely. if not almost entirely, out of the
25 per cent resolution; in other words, but
for the adoption of die 25 per cent resolu
tion, there would in all probability have
been no suit to enjoin the enforcement
of the 8 per cent grain rate reduction, be
cause it is apparent from the hill In equity
filed In this case that the complainant
treated the 8 per cent grain rate reduction
and the 25 per cent resolution as one
thing, so much so that there is no allega
tion whatever showing or tending to show
how far the S per cent grain rate reduc
tion, standing alone, would have affected
the revenues of the company. There was
no effort, so far as complainant is con
cerned, to treat these resolutions &9stand
ing separate from each other. The 8 per
cent grain rate reduction was simply
treated as a part of the 25 per cent reduc
tion proposed by the entire resolution,
Commission inform me that in their opin
ion the 25 per cent horizontal reduction
; has been by the court finally disposed of,
they also state that the complainant.
Southern Pacific Company . does not at all
admit that the 25 per cent horizontal cut : Thus it will be seen that the sole and
; has been disposed of, but it contends that, only issue remaining to be tried in the
notwithstanding the court refused to con-! so-called grain case is as to whether or
i â¦ Inue the temporary injunction as..to that >â¢<>' the. rates proposed to be enforced are
; portion of the resolution, yet the same is | lair, just" and reasonable. If the case is
, still before the court, and must be con- j tried it is the duty of the commission to
sldered and determined by, the court on
final hearing.
But If it is conceded that the 25 per cent
resolution amounts to nothing, and is out
of the case, and therefore the litigation
must proceed as involving only the 8 per
cent grain reduction, the question re
mains as to whether it is for the benefit
or to the interest of the people of this
State that this litigation should so pro
ceed.
It may be well here to call attention as
briefly as possible to some of the main is
sues presented In the pleadings, other
than -the direct issue as to the reason
ableness or unreasonableness of the 8 per
cent grain rate reduction.
In the secret report is the proof that
the Railroad Commissioners know that
they are, themselves, dishonest in ask
ing Judge Morrow, to dismiss "grain
case." Before ' Herrin's wine touched
the brain of . Blackstock and the orig
inal .report .was yet untouched by.Her
rin there was no secret of the fact that
the Southern Pacific Company and not
the Railroad Commission should ask
Judge Morrow, for a dismissal of .the
case. This part of : the report, every
word of which was eliminated' by Wil
liam F. Herrin, is as follows: .
Another Important matter decided ; by
, the Circuit Court, based upon numerous
i decisions of the Supreme Court of the
; United States, is that while the commis-
s ion has the constitutional and statutory
' authority to regulate and to fix freights
and tares, yet the same must be just
and reasonable, and if not so, the ques
tion as to whether or not they are just
and reasonable may be investigated and
determined by a court of competent juris
diction, it having been determined, so
the court holds and decides, that if the
Legislature or a commission created by
the Legislature shall have justly and
reasonably regulated and fixed freights
and fares of common carriers, the same
I must be sustained by the courts: but If,
on the contrary, they are as fixed by the
Legislature or a commission unreasona
ble and unjust and confiscatory In their
character, then the court will declare
them to be void and of no effect.
The respondent, the Railroad Commis
sioners, in its answer to complainant's
bill, in addition to denying all the allega
tions thereof, raised a number of impor
tant affirmative defenses, among which
was the alleged unlawful combination of
the so-called Pacific system and the Ille
gality of the leases made by the constit
uent railroads composing said system
made to the Southern Pacific. The court,
in passing upon these important proposi
tions, held that the commission was
estopped from raising them, because in
its resolution it had recognized the sys
j tern and undertook to fix the rate charges
j which the Pacific Railroad should be per
i mitted to enforce as a whole. It was fur
ther held by the court in this regard that
I while it was the duty. of the commission
' to regulate and fix freights and fares, yet
it had no jurisdiction to Investigate ques
i tions regarding the corporate powers of
| railroads and transportation companies
'. or contracts made or entered Into by
j them, for purposes of combination or oth
erwise.
show that they are just, fair and reason
able, and, on the contrary, as a conclu
sion-deduced from the averments of the
1 complainant's bill, it is fair to conclude
It will undertake to show that, consider
ing the cost of its property, the cost of
maintenance, the money required to pay
interest on its bonded debts, etc., the
rates are unjust and unreasonable. If
the court should determine that they are
: unjust and unreasonable, then the reso
lution would, in my opinion, simply be
declared to be void and of no effect, and
the commission,, as a result, with refer
ence to the same, will be placed exactly
in the same position that it was on the
date of the adoption thereof, and that it
would be its duty to proceed to make a
schedule. of rates placed "upon the condi-
I tions above set forth which, would be
I deemed. by the courts to be just and rea
j sonable. . _ :
_.-I< am .advised by the Attorney General
and by counsel retained by the board that
it will require enormous labor, a very
wide range of investigation by expert wit
nesses and the expenditure of not less
than $30,000 to prepare this case for sub
mission by the respondents for decision
to the Circuit -Court; that it will take
years to try It, one counsel stating that
It- will - require possibly < five or. six years,
and another one . that it would ; not take
less than four years to take the case to
Conspiracy of

mission Is Ex
posed.
the Supreme Court of the "United States,
where it would inevitably be taken should
it be pushed to final judgment. I am
further advised by counsel, and the rec
ords show, that up to the present time
there has been expended in the trial of
this case more than $43,000. and that to
conclude it and take it through the courts
of last resort will require a further ex- :
penditure of at least $67,000.
Should we press the cause with due
diligence, in my own opinion, it would re
quire at least the remainder of our term
to bring it to a final conclusion. And
then what would be the result so far as
we are concerned? It would be, if we won
the case, to have the court declare that j
an 8 per cent reduction on grain was just, |
fair and reasonable and that the schedule I
made in pursuance thereof should be en- ;
forced as of the date of its- service upon !
the Southern Pacific Company, which
would run back to a period six or seven
years prior to the date of judgment.
In view of these undoubted conditions I
existing at this date, and to inevitably
result in the future, is it our duty, repre
senting the State and exercising a sound
discretion as the agents of the State . to
make this extraordinary expenditure
without any compensatory result, which
undoubtedly, in my opinion, would be the
case?
I believe that 1 am justified in calling !
your attention to the fact that it is com- I
mon report and undoubtedly the fact that 1
in nearly all the great grain raising sec- j
tions of the State of California grain j
rates have been reduced since -he adop- !
tion of the resolution in question to an
amount far exceeding a horizontal cut of
8 per cent. The truth is, as I have been
credibly informed, that in the San Joa
quin Valley in some instances grain rates
have been rcuced 50 per cent, and in all
parts of the valley an amount much in
excess of 8 per cent. I am also credibly
informed that in the Sacramento Valley
grain rates have been reduced voluntarily
by the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany, in many instances to an amount
equal to 33 1-3 per cent. So that you see
that If these conditions exist and these
statements are true it would be folly on
the part of the commission to further con
tinue this litigation.
I am advised by ex-Railroad Commis
sioner La Rue, and also by one of the
special counsel of the commission, that
the Southern Pacific Company made an
oral proposal to Mr. La Rue â¢ to compro
mise the case. The offer, as I under
stand it to have been, was that the South
ern Pacific Company would dismiss its
suit in the Circuit Court, on condition
that the Railroad Commission would re
peal that part of the resolutions rel.it-
ing to a 2."> per cent reduction of all freight
rates, It being understood that the com
pany would submit to the 8 per cent re
duction of grain rates as of the date of
the resolutions. The objection was made
by the commission, as 1 understand it,
that the said proposal to compromise was
not in writing, and therefore, and for
that reason only, no action was taken on
said offer of compromise. I understood
Mr. La Rue and the other members of
the board to say that had said offer been
in writing, they would have accepted
it and settled the case on the terms pro
posed.
The Southern Pacific Company has not
renewed said offti to the present, com
mission or any member thereof as far as
I am advised. Neither has the commis
sion ever suggested to the Southern Pa
cific Company, or its counsel, that it was
willing to compromise the case on the â 
terms proposed to Mr. La Rue. Such a |
settlement, as I view the case, since be- j
coming familiar with it, and in view of
the changed conditions with relation to
grain rates as above set forth, would
not, in my opinion, be to the best inter
ests of the grain rate payers in tnis \
State. Wherefore, and as' a conclusive, â 
final and effective solution of the whole I
question, provided the same can be le- I
gally done, it seems to me that the whole
resolution covering the 8 per cent grain
rate reduction, as well as the 25 per cent
genei .1 horizontal cut, should be by the
commission at once repealed and rescind- j
ed, thus leaving the commission free to |
adopt rates, based upon present condi
tions, and to adjust, if possible, the nu
merous complaints constantly coming be- i
fore the board of discriminations of j
freight and passenger charges. This is
to my mind manifestly the only course
to pursue so that the hands of the com
mission may be untied, and it can, for it- i
self take the responsibility of putting
into effect the constitutional and statu
tory provisions of the State, as Judge .
McKenna has most clearly, defined them
to be. Respectfully submitted,
N. BLACKSTOCK.
It was not to be expected that Wil
liam F. Herrin would permit such opin- j
ions to go before the public- Although
Blackstock had proved himself sub- j
servient, to the Southern Pacific he had
in this original report, with a desire to j
serve his railroad masters, unwittingly
presented their case in the very man- j
ncr they did not wish. Blackstock is i
anything but clever, and when the j
foregoing part of his report was sub- ;
mitted to Herrin immediately there was
a slashing nd cut of pages and a new
report. Herrin changed words, phrases,
opinions. He eliminated that which he
did not want and inserted what lie !
wished. He inserted the vitally impor
tant proposition, which is palpably un- j
true, that the hands of the Railroad
Commission will be tied as long as the
grain case is in the Circuit Court.
Herrin changed in this part of the I
report the whole aspect of the case. He
laid the foundation, for the ridiculous i
proceedings taken before Judge Mor- j
row. With the craft of his trade he j
expatiated on the expense and time i
which it would cost to continue the |
case in court. He eliminated every fact
which even his Railroad Commissioner
had been forced. in common decency to
admit. A comparison between what
Blackstock originally wrote and what
Herrin forced him to sign will show the
Southern Pacific Company absolutely
trapped in one of the most audacious
pieces of villainy yet exposed.
The published report, in its conclud
ing passages, which mean the revision
of Herrin, reads as follows:

I have seen many of the promi
nent public men now in London,
who I know have been friends of
the American republic when it has
needed friends. From the highest
to the lowest, without exception,
they have met me with expressions
of deep regret that the republic
founded by Washington and his
colleagues upon plans so much
higher than any other state should
have fallen to the level of the mili
tary states of Europe.
Some of these men stood with Bright
in his campaign against the imperial
party here that longed to strike us down.
I repeat that without exception these men
lament the lapse from true Americanism
to this miserable imperialism.
I have met men of the other class who
struck us when the republic was down.
Let me give them credit for the change In
their feelings toward America. I know
them now to be the foremost advocates
of the race alliance, but I also know that
if I were a British statesman there is no
price I would not pay for alliance with
Americaâ no price too high for securing
her entrance into the troubled waters of
the far East, because the true desire of
English-speaking men is that we should
stand together as against men not of our
race.
4- Nature made blood thicker than -f
4- water, and an alliance with the re- 4
*4-' public is now the keynote of the 4
-- British policy, and wisely so, but 4
-- not an alliance with our present in- 4
-- dustrial republic. Our present War 4
-- Lord only makes himself ridiculous 4
-- in the eyes of these statesmen, with 4
-4* three battleships at his back, and 4
-- only 40.000 soldiers, strutting like 4-'
4- a peacock, as vain and just as 4.
4- harmless. No; it is not the present 4
-4 industrial republic that England 4
-- wishes to have as her ally: it is the 4
-- republic that England sees America 4
-4 must become if she does not soon 4
-- reverse her policy in regard to the 4
-4* Philippines. +
We must have a tremendous navy and a
huge standing army, for Britain judges
truly that into whatever enterprise the
republic goes she will not be content very
long to play second fiddle. She is now
only the catspaw of England. She could
not maintain her position for a day in
Manila if England withdrew her august
protection.
This is a humiliating position. It makes
my blood boil as I speak of the recreant
President who is the sole cause of it. He
it was who changed his mind and de
manded the Philippines against the ad
vice and wishes of most of his colleagues.
Will the President permit the sacrifice of
the lives of our soldiers much longer in a
futile attempt to conquer 1200 islands that
would not stay conquered if beaten? Such
is the position as viewed from London.
You ask my personal views of the
future. I answer President McKin
ley will not be allowed by the man
agers of the Republican party to
continue his follyâ his crime. I
believe he has already been in
formed by those whose voice he
cannot disregard that he must stop
and return to American traditions.
The country- has no stomach for
victories over people fighting for
the right of self-government.
Reading between the lines it is seen
that he is now veering around. Had he
authorized or directed Otis to grant Agui
naldo the conference the latter asked be
fore the war broke out all that has hap
pened since would have been unneces
sary. To-day we see his commission tak
ing every means in its power to get a
conference with Aguinaldo. More, they
are not standing on forms. General Otis,
It is reported to-day, cables that he still
wants to push on military operations, to
which President Schurman objects. The
contrast between Otis and Dewey is sig
nificant. Dewey always reports only what
he has done. Otis has misled the coun
try several times about what he is going
to de,. His plan, of campaign is given out
with a great flourish of trumpets. He was
going to corral the enemy. See far he has
been a complete failure. He won skir
mishes, as everybody expected, but lost
the campaign.
The suppiesslon of news from Manila
which our Republican President enforces
would not be tolerated by the monarchi
es', Britons. One suppressed cable from
Manila comes via Hongkong to-day tell
ing us the Nebraska regiment is reduced
to 300 men.. with 160 on the sick list. The
season approaches when military opera
tions must cease, and the President no
doubt stands aghast at the grave situa
tion. He is now reported as going to call
an extra session of Congress in a vain ef
fort to retrieve hlmselt of responsibility.
My forecast is that the President will
get out of the Philippines and return to
American principles, obtaining a shadowy
protectorate of some form that will
"save his face," and that he will then be
able to appear before the Republican
convention having the Philippine ques
tion settled, having given them
the same promise of independence
he gave Cuba. Our party will
then carry the Presidential election.
If he approached the country with the
war In the Philippines unsettled, and
the convention were free, it is Impossible
that he would get even the nomination.
The weight would be too great to carry.
The nomination, however, he has prob
ably already secured. But the election
would then be another story. If the
Democratic party were to drop free silver
and come out under the leadership of
the World for Americanismâ presenting
to the people a clean-cut issue between
the principles of Washington and those
of McKinleyâ there would be no doubt of
the result. Our party would be beaten
and deserve to be.
There; you have tempted me into
prophecyâ a dangerous business.

MANILA, May IS. â Twenty
American scouts, under com
mand of Captains Case and
Berkheimer, supported by two com
panies of the Minnesota and Oregon
volunteer regiments, flanked the in
surgents at San Ildefonso this morn
ing and captured the town. The Fili
pinos were so terrorized that al
though they fired 20,000 rounds of
ammunition they only slightly wound
ed one scout. The Americans killed
one insurgent officer and wounded six
men. The insurgents retreated to
San Miguel, six miles northward of
San Ildefonso.
Captured records show that 20 per j
cent of the opposing insurgent force
has been killed and wounded since |
Law-ton's advance began on May 1. !
General Rios, Spain's military represen
tative here, says the inhabitants of
Zamboango on the island of Mindanao,
demanded arms from General Montero i
for the defense against the landing of !
American forces, but their request was '
refused. On account of this refusal the
natives at midnight opened fire on the \
Spaniards from across the square with
machine guns and rifles stolen from
former Spanish gunboats recently sold j
by Spain. The natives were repulsed j
with great loss. General Montero and
Major of Engineers Bulle were gravely
wounded, Lieutenant Grandada was ;
slightly injured, one private soldier was |
killed and three wounded. The natives
have cut off the water supply and other
resources of the Spaniards at Zam
boanga.
Aguinaldo has issued orders that all
foreigners must leave insurgent terri
tory within forty-eight hours. There
are only a few commercial men there,
mostly English and German. Aguinaldo
believes that by refusing them the
rights of non-combatants, he can force
their governments to . recognize the
belligerency of . his . .so-called govern
ment in order that he may treat for the
safety. of their subjects. â 
A Filipino priest who had talked with
the Tagal General Treas has brought
to Father McKinnon a copy of a letter
written 'by Aguinaldo to General
Treas, asking his opinion as to the ad
visability of surrendering. The letter
concludes: "I fear that the long war

DIPLOMAS GRANTED
BY STATE BOARD
OF EDUCATION
Number of Complaints Investi
gated at the Quarterly
Meeting.
SACRAMENTO, May 13â At the quar
terly meeting of the State Board of Edu
cation to-day a number of complaints rel
ative to diplomas were investigated
At its meeting last year the board re
ceived an application from Philip Condit,
principal of the High School at Eureka,
for a high school certificate. It was at
that time brought ta the attention of the
board that in order to advance himself
four years in the line of promotion Condit
had represented that he had obtained de
grees from certain educational institu
tions of note, and that such representa
tions were false. Conuit was given until
this meeting to make a showing for him
self, but, failing to put in an appearance,
his application was denied.
The- protest against the action of the
board In granting a life diploma to Miss
Ella D. Ale of San Diego was ignored.
Miss Ale was granted a grammar grade
certificate by the County Board of Edu
cation of San Diego County. Upon such
certificate she was last year granted a
life diploma by the State Board of Educa
tion. It afterward developed that the
grammar grade certificate was granted
upon what purported to be a life certifi
cate from the State of Pennsylvania, but
which in reality merely entitled the hold
er to teach in one particular county.* The
State Board of Education this afternoon
held that its proceedings in the matter
had been regular and that the life di
ploma would have to stand Until the
grammar grade certificate was properly
revoked by the San Diego board.
The following diplomas were granted
by the Board: Â -â¢

said: "We go or stay together."
The armies of the United States have
advanced so far that the question of
transportation has become the great
problem. To solve it the engineers are
repairing the Ragbag bridge so that
it will be safe for the passage of trains
and give railroad connection between
Manila and San Fernando. In the
meantime supplies shipped to Calumplt
have to be hauled fifteen miles to Ma
jor General Mac Arthur at San Fer
nando and twenty miles to Major Gen
eral Lawton at Bacolor by bullock
carts, and every cart has to be ferried
separately on a raft across the Rio
Grande two or three times.
The roads are rough and, after the
daily showers which are forerunners of
the rainy season, so soft that It is im
possible to make more than a mile an
hour. The few mules that are here
have been found greatly superior to
bullocks for this work. The latter die
unless they are given frequent baths,
and the heat has killed so many that
carting is now all done by night.
The policy of humane warfare has Its
disadvantages. Among the thousands
of pretended friendly natives who are
returning to their homes behind the
American army, there are some who
have taken advantage of the gener
osity of the conquerors to make the
zone unsafe unless Americans go well
armed and in parties. Soldiers going
about alone are frequently fired upon
from houses or from behind bushes. \
During the past week it has been found
necessary to send guards with wagons
and ambulances, and several attempts -
have been made to wreck trains by
placing obstructions upon the railroad
track.
The Filipinos have resumed the at- J
tempt to induce the Americans to dis
cuss the situation. Reyes, a young ,
lieutenant on the staff of General Greg- {
oria del Pilar, came to General Lawton j
under a flag of truce. He was accom- :
panied by a barefooted bugler. The two |
were escorted to Manila by Captain .
Sewell, of General' Lawton's staff, i
Reyes told Major General Otis that
Aguinaldo desired passes for a military J
commission to come to Manila to con
fer with the American Philippine Com
missioners. General Otis replied that
passes would not be necessary, as. un
armed commissioners could enter the
American lines. He would leave the
matter, he said, in General Lawton's
hands. ', !:â¢,..â¢.;

WILLOWS. May 13.â As an out
â¢ growth of the Murdock note case there
! came near being a shooting affray after
: the adjournment of court this after
\ noon. Grove L. Johnson and Detective
I Safty, the. latter in the employ of the
\ defense, were the principals in the dif
: ficulty. Safty was yesterday accused
; by Attorneys Johnson and Freeman of
i having interfered with a Juror. He
; took exception to this, and insulted
I Johnson in the Crawford Hotel as the
! attorney was' entering with his wife.
j Johnson brushed Safty aside and the
j detective reached for his revolver. Sur
! rounded by persons interested in the
j defense, together with some other de
| tectives, Johnson remarked that he was
at a disadvantage, but" said he would
call Freeman and return in a moment.
| He rushed out and soon returned with
j Freeman. Safty was hurried away and
the excitement subsided, but it is
feared there will be trouble. Safty has
collided with the plaintiff's attorneys
on several occasions. He objected to
Attorney Freeman's method of exam
ining jurors and was called down by
that attorney during the first days of
the trial.
F. C. Lusk, attorney for the defen
dants, began his closing argument in
the note case this morning. . The tes
timony was reviewed at length, and the
witnesses for the plaintiff were treated
to a severe castigation. Mr. Lusk made
a strong argument. He 'will continue

SACRAMENTO, May 13â The Grand
Jury, which has been in session at in
tervals for several months, this evening
filed its report.. The most Interesting
feature of the document is . its treat
ment of the gambling question. No in
dictments are found against any of the
officials for malfeasance, but they are
soundly rapped for their failure to en
force the law.
. Within the past year many grotesque
demonstrations have been made toward
the enforcement of th- statutes against
prohibited games. An edict inspired
by the Mayor would issue from the of
fice of the police department, directing
the officers to arrest all offenders. A
faro dealer and Chinese lottery agent
or two would be given a ride jailward
in the patrol wagon and at the spec
tacle there would be much rejoicing in
the ranks of the lawabiding. Minis
terial unions would pass resolutions ex
pressive of their satisfaction at the
heroic opposition of the Mayor against
the hosts of evil and the impression
would go abroad that the moral atmos
phere of the town had been materially
clarified. But the searchers for the
tiger's lair would have no difficulty in
finding that animal at its accustomed
stand, and in less than a week from the
manifestation of administrative virtue
things would be running at the same
old gait. v -\yi ... â  -
Meantime a considerable number of
citizens who remembered the miles of
streets improved under the system of
licensing of gambling followed when
John Q. Brown was Mayor .. twelve
years ago would urge as the . only
remedy the return of the license plan.
The Grand Jury appears to share this
idea of a corrective measure for the
evil, although under the existing State
law no municipality has the authority
to license or otherwise legalize gam
bling. Here is the way the Grand Jury
treats the subject in the report - just
filed:
Gambling is carried on In our midst to
an extent that should arrest the attention ,
Of every thoughtful mind in the comun
ity, as not -the slightest effort is being ,
made upon the part -.of those officers
whose duty it is to carry into effect the
laws of the commonwealth prohibiting
gambling to suppress the many illegal
games which are being conducted in open
defiance of the law.
Poolrooms, keno, faro and Chinese lot
teries, besides the Innumerable, games to j
be found in the rear of cigar "stores, are |
patronized by those who are possessed of i
what might be justly termed a most
vicious form of avarice, and who, in the I
pursuit of a fantastic fortune, stake all,
and quit with nothing. : ;
It is a sad commentary upon the effi- j
ciency of our laws when the chief magis
trate of the city will admit that illegal
games are carried on, but that he is
powerless to suppress them. We recom
mend that measures be taken looking to ;
the entire suppression or the. licensing of |
gambling.. . ; , ' . , .. " .V
Having thus disposed of the city offi
cials, the report takes a shy at the
county branch as follows:
The Board of Supervisors has not given
to the business of the county that careful
consideration that the people have the
right to expect from those officials. The
lack of system, sound judgment and busi
ness sense which they have evinced In
public matters would soon wreck any pri
vate enterprise.
While it is not probable that any at
tention will be paid to the report of
the Grand Jury on the gambling ques
tion, there can be no doubt that there
is good ground for Its criticisms. ' The
Chinese lotteries are especially arro
gant, and it is not an uncommon thing
to find Chinese laundrymen acting as
agents for these lotteries on their visits
to households. The police make an ar
rest now and then, but no real effort
has yet been made to wipe out this
form of gambling, which, with Its two
daily drawings, operates as a heavy
tax upon the resources of hundreds of
people. The criticism which the report
finds against the gamblinr practiced in
the rear of cigar stores, which young
men and even boys patronize, is also
regarded as well directed, although It
Is not deemed at all likely that these
pernicious games will be broken up.
PRIZE -.HILL OF CADETS.
Company B^of St. Matthew's School
Wins Perkins Medal.
PACIFIC GROVE, May 13.â The cadets
of St. Matthew's School of San Mateo,
who have been in camp here for the past
week, to-day held the most notable event
of the school yearâ the annual competitive
company drill for the Perkins medal.
Companies A and B, with fifty and forty
eight men respectively, competed. Each
did unusually good work, and the contest
was very close. Major A. J. Kirk, U. S.
A., commandant of St. Matthew's School,
andÂ« Ensign George Kammerer of the
United States Naval Battalion judged the
contest.
Company B won the trophy, making a
score of 91% out of a possible 100, Com
pany A scoring 89 7-10. Company A showed
splend'dly In foot movements, but was
greatly outclassed by Company B In the
manual of arms. Company B stood high
er in inspection of arms also.' The drill
trophy, which Captain J. Valentine now
proudly wears for Company B, is a hand
some jeweled- gold medal presented by
United States Senator George C. Perkins
to St. Matthew's School.
The cadets returned to San Mateo this
afternoon to complete the school year.

BLACKSTOCK'S
REPORT
...
Continued from First Page.
Judge McKenna, based upon numerous
decisions of the Supreme Court of the
United States, is that, while the commis
sion has the constitutional and statutory
authority to regulate and to fix freights
and fares, yet, the same must be just
and reasonable and the question as to
whether or not they are just and reason
able may be investigated and determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction, it
having been established by the decisions
that if the Legislature or a commission
created by the Legislature or by consti
tutional law shall have justly and rea
sonably regulated and fixed' freight and
fares of common carriers,. the same must
be sustained by the courts, but if, on the
contrary, they are fixed by the Legisla
ture or the commission unreasonable and
unjust and confiscatory in their charac
ter, then the court will declare them to be
void and of no effect. â¢;,.â¢
The- respondents, the Railroad Commis
sioners, in their answer to the complain
ant's bill, in addition to denying all the
allegations thereof, raised a number of
important affirmative defenses, among
which was the alleged unlawful combina
tion of the so-called Pacific system, and
the illegality of the leases made by the
constituent railroad companies compos
ing, said system to the Southern Pacific
Company. Judge McKenna, in passing
upon these important propositions, held
that the commission was estopped from
raising them, because in its resolution it
had recognized the system and undertook
to fix the rate of charges which the roads
operated by the Southern Pacific Com
pany of California. should be permitted to
charge as a whole. It was ; further held
by Judge McKenna In this regard that,
while it was the duty of the commission
to regulate and fix freight and fares, yet
It had no jurisdiction to Investigate ques
tions regarding the corporate powers of
railroad and transportation companies or
regarding contracts made or entered into
by them for the purposes of combination
or otherwise.
â  It is evident that many questions which
might be raised against the railroad com
pany in these matters have been fore
closed by the particular form of the ac
tion of the commission complained of in
this case, and it certainly is desirable
that in any litigation which may be
raised the action of the commission
should be in such form as would enable
the commission to defend Its action as
thoroughly as possible.
So far as this case is concerned, it ap
pears that the only material question pre
sented is as to whether or not the 8 per
cent grain-rate schedule promulgated by
the commission is fair, just and reason
able. It is matter of common knowledge,
and undoubtedly the fact, that the South
ern Pacific Company, in order to meet
the competition of the Valley Road, has
reduced its rates in the territory affected
by that competition, so that the same are
now, and have been for some time, as low
as or even lower than the rates prescribed
by the. 8 per cent grain-rate schedule of
the commission: also that reductions have
been made by the Southern Pacific Com
pany in the Sacramento Valley, so that
at the present time the difference be
tween the rates actually enforced by the
railroad company and the rates proposed
by the 8 per cent grain-rate schedule is
Very small, such difference, in all prob
ability, not affecting the revenue of the
company to an" extent exceeding : $30,000
per annum. Certainly, as the case now
stands, the substantia] pecuniary matters
in issue are slight, and the question is
whether a decision of these matters in
favor of the State will justify the great
expense and delay which must be In
curred In order to reach a final decision.
I am advised by the, Attorney General
and by counsel retained In this case, by
our predecessors that it will require enor
mous labor and a very wide range of in
vestigation of expert witnesses and the
expenditure of not less than $30,000 to
prepare the case for submission by the
respondents to the Circuit Court for deci
sion; that it will take years to try it, one
counsel stating that it will require pos
sibly five or six years, another one that It
would not take less than four years to
take the case through the Supreme Court
of the United States, where it' would in
evitably be taken should it be pushed to
final judgment. I am further advised, as
appears by the records and by the report
of the. Attorney General to the Assembly,
that up to the present time there has
been paid and Incurred in counsel fees
and expenses of this case more than $43,000
âthe counsel fees alone amounting to over
$30,000. And it further appears from like

sources that the future costs and ex
penses of this litigation will be at least
$67,000 more. 530,000 of which will be re
quired as fees for experts and $30,000 as
fees of special counsel. Should we press
the case with diligence, in my opinion it
would require at least the remainder of
the term of office of the present commis
sion to bring it to a final conclusion, and
during all this time the hands of the com
mission would be tied so that It practi
cally could not investigate or make any
reduction or changes in the rates now en
forced. It seems to me that, even if we
could be assured of a final judgment in
this case, the expenditure of time and
money necessary to accomplish this end
would not be justified, even to reach such
a result; on the contrary, it seems clear
that the people are interested far more
in securing actual reductions of rates
wherever the same may be had rather
than that they should bear the heavy bur
dens of this litigation, even to secure a
favorable decision, which, as I have
shown, would accomplish very little for
the actual benefit of the people.
While not desiring to criticize the acts
of our predecessors, it is evident that a
serious mistake was made in adopting the
so-called 25, per cent freight ra_e resolu
tion. Had the commission confined its
official action to the promulgation of rates
actually determined upon, it is not like
ly that any litigation would have resulted,
In which case the people would have se
cured at once the benefits of the reduc
tions made, and would not have been
called upon to bear the expenses of this
litigation, the outcome of which is ex
ceedingly uncertain at best. It is the
duty of the commission to. secure, so far
as it can legally, reductions in rates of
transportation, and it is evident that no
such result can be accomplished by any
general horizontal reduction of the rates
maintained by the company; on the con
trary, the only, practical method of se
curing any reduction is to. investigate
each class of rates and to remove such
discriminations as may be found, and to
reduce any particular rates or classes of
rates which may be found exorbitant, to
the basis of a reasonable and fair rate.
When this is done, it is certain that the
company will not have the advantages
which it has secured in the present liti
gation, growing out of the particular
form of the resolution adopted by the
board. ' j -'J\4
In view of these undoubted conditions
existing at this date, and of the results
which are certain to accrue in the future,
is it our duty, representing the. State and
exercising sound discretion as the agents
of the State, to make the. extraordinary
expenditure without compensatory result
which will undoubtedly be required in the
further prosecution of this case? I am
unqualifiedly of the opinion that the
continuance of this litigation is not In the
interest of the people of the State, ami
that it is the duty of this board, so 'far
as it has the power, to terminate this lit
igation, so that it may free its hands and
save further expense to the State, and
thereafter proceed by regular methods to
secure such advantages as may be had
for the benefit of the shippers of freight.
. I find it to be in the power of .this com
mission, without the consent of the rail
road company, to terminate this litiga
tion by repeal and rescindment of the
whole resolution, covering the 8. per cent
grain-rate reduction as well as the 25 per
cent general horizontal reduction. By the
rescindment and repeal of this resolution
the entire basis of the suit is removed,
and the case must fall, and with it the in
junction against this commission, leaving
the commission free to adopt rates based
upon present conditions and to adjust, if
possible, the numerous - complaints con
stantly coming before the board of dis
crimination in freight and , passenger
charges. This, to my mind, manifestly is
the oniy proper course to pursue, so that
the hands of th*- commission may be un
tied and it can fcr itself take the respon
sibility of putting into effect the consti
tutional and statutory provisions of the
State as Judge McKenna has most clearly
defined them to exist. ... ____Â . ., ..,ââ'..'
In pursuance of the conclusions reached
by me and stated in the foregoing re

ANXIETY AS TO THE
* ADVANCE ON BACOLOR
: NEW YORK, May 13.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
Official Washington is waiting with con
siderable anxiety for the result of the
movement against Bacolor, which has
been begun by troops under command jof
General Mac Arthur and General Lawton.
No news of the present ; location of' the
troops or when the assault on the insur
gents encamped at Bacolor may be ex
pected has been received by department
officials, and it ls presumed that the time
which has elapsed since. , the receipt of
General Otis' last message has been oc
cupied in making a disposition of the
men necessary to prevent the escape . of
the 9000 Filipinos believed to be
intrenched at that point. It had been
hoped by this time that General I^wton
would be in the vicinity of Bacolor but
the operations of his scouts at San liae
fonso. reported this afternoon. WOUUJ
seem to indicate that his headquarters
are still not far from Baling. San Ilcie- 1
fonso is just to the north of Massin about
eighteen miles to the northeast of Bacolor
and fourteen miles to the eastward at
Maxico, where General Luna s headquar
ters are established. ,
No official advices have been received
regarding: the operations of scouts under
Captain Berkeimer. and it is believed in
the absence of such information that
General Otis is awaiting the results of the
present movement before making any re
port.
Officials familiar with the latest advices
from General Otis are hopeful that by
this time Genera! Mac Arthur has moved
his coiumn so as to occupy the railroad
connecting Bacolor with the northern sec
tion of the island. Four miles separate
his headquarters at San Fernando and
the railroad. With the wagon route con
nectlng San Fernando and Bacolor in his
possession and the railroad occupied by
his troops it would be an extremely diffi
cult matter for the Insurgent general at
Baeolor to retire with his entire army.
General Otis, it is expected, will sencl
gunboats up the numerous streams
traversing the country to the south of
Bacolor. so that they can effectively co
operate with General'MacArthur and Gen
eral Lawton when the attack on that city
is made.
AYith the reinforcements sent to Gen
eral Mac Arthur and to General LawtOll
the authorities are confident that these
officers will have a sufficient force to de
stroy tho insurgent army and capture a
large number of its members, and at thÂ»
same time make a demonstration which
will hold General Luria In check.

Free Turkish Baths
A New Invention That Enables Ycu to Enjoy

It Is Sent on Trial Absolutely Free in Order
That Invalids and the Sick May Real-

: venating Turkish Bath.
The exquisite stimulation of the hot
Vapor or Turkish Baih is usually lost by
reason of the conditions one must under-
go to obtain the luxury. To overcome this
a genius up in Battle Creek- Mich., the
home of hygiene and of advanced health
| methods, has constructed a device that is
portable, cheap, effective and combines
every essential feature of the most ele-
gantly appointed Turkish and Russian
Bath' Parlors. As* many people have never
taken a genuine Turkish bath, do not un-
derstand them, but are interested, the
proprietors of the invention will send it
to any home on free trial, so that the
merits of the bath may be fully tested be-
fore the apparatus is purchased.
Send your name and address to Kellogg
Sanitas Co., 185 E. Main St., Battle Creek,
Mich., and they will send you their fine
booklet on health and hygiene. . Select
the style you prefer and cabinet will be
expressed direct to your home where you
can try it fully and freely. If satisfac-
-1 tory, keep it, otherwise order it sent back
| and be under no expense whatever.
The real benefit of the Turkish bath
' comes with the opportunity to immediate-
Â«iy retire, to a couch and take a short nap.
Peoule often say that the bath is so won-
derfully bracing they feel as if they could
"jump over the moon." Having the bath
in your own rooms affords immunity from
j taking cold, a frequent danger attending
' the journey to and from the public bath
houses. And think of the saving in cost!
A cabinet, pays for itself in less than a

COMPARISONS
NOT POPULAR
Arouses English Ire by
Classing Sampson With
the Great Nelson.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. May 13.â While proverb
ially slow, the Britisher is at the same
time very thin-skinned when anything
concerning his idol is attacked. Em
bassador Choate has gotten himself
Into a little hot water on account of
his speech at the British and Foreign
Sailors' Society â¢ting on Monday.
Mr. Choate, in his easy, eloquent style,
dilated on the excellence of the British
sailor and mentioned in the most eulo
gistic manner the exploits of Nelson.
But he should have stopped at this.
Instead, he continued and said that
America had brought forward two new
heroes to stand side by side with Nel
son, "our Dewey and our Sampson."
This remark was not received with as
much enthusiasm as hi? previous ones.
and next day our Embassador found
that he had stirred up quite a little
hornet's nest when he read some of the
criticisms of his speech.
The Globe was particularly hard hit
by the Embassador's allusions and
said: "It really seems that President;
McKinley was 'right in exhorting his;
Embassador to avoid very much speak-
Ing. Mr. Choate has put his toot in it.
He sees things in curious perspective. ;
if he puts his own specials on a level
with Nelson. Nelson was a strong
man, but he was certainly not a Samp
son.' He was only blind ln one eye, ;
but could always see his enemy well
enough to get at close quarters with
him."
The same paper, evidently still In ill
humor over Mr. Choate's remarks,
takes the opportunity to have a little I
fane at President McKinley about the ;
â .lory of his narrow escape from being j
run over and his sudden trip to Hot
Springs, Va. It says: ' A singularly j
â r.:' rtur.ate President, he appears to ;
be always in hot water of me kind." |

ARE CUBANS
PLOTTING AN
INSURRECTION?
Gomez and His Military Staff
Likely to Make Trouble
for Uncle Sam.
Â£p__lal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 13.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Though no official reports I
have been received from Major General
Brooke foreshadowing trouble with the
I Cubans there is reason to believe that
the authorities are not altogether satis
fied with the situation in the island.
An official with whom I talked to-day !
explained that the danger lay in the ;
politicians surrounding Gomez. Gen- ;
eral Gomez has a staff of 150 officers, â 
whom he must either support or provide
office for, and it was with a view to
making the latter provision that he re- '
cently wrote a letter to- the President,
urging him to permit the organization
of an army of 15,000 Cubans to preserve
peace and order in the island. That
permission was distinctly and em- |
phatically refused by the President.
The administration does not propose
to permit the Cubans to maintain their
army organization much longer. If the |
disbandment desired does not occur j
immediately after payment is ma - to j
the men measures will be taken to scat- j
ter the Cubans and take their weapons
from them. In this connection consid
erable surprise is manifested at the I
larg- number of arms and quantity of I
ammunition which has been collected j
by Cubans and seized by United States
officials. It is regarded in seme quar- !
ters as an indication of preparation be- !
ing made by Cubans for an insurrection j
against the United States in case all I
their wishes are not complied with.
Some apprehension is expressed in I
official circles that the $3,000,000 which ,
will be distributed among the Cubans
will be used by them in fighting the |
United States. Even supposing, how
ever, that the men decline to surrender j
the money received from this Govern
ment for the purpose of purchasing I
arms and ammunition, one of the offi- j
cials said that he feared, after the men i
had spent their allotment, they would
resort to brigandage and finally form
into bands, which they would term I
armies.
It is apparent to officials from all they j
have learned that the United States will
have to display a strong hand in the j
administration of Cuban affairs. Major j
P. H. Ray, who has just returned from j
Manzanillo, has explained to the offi- !
cials the necessity of dealing firmly i
with the Cubans, and he speaks of the i
necessity he was under of shooting i
: several Cubans who were found robbing ,
plantations, before the remainder would j
! understand that the Americans were
! not to be trifled with.
While General Brooke has been in- <
i structed to be as conciliatory as possi- i
| ble and endeavor to preserve peace by i
peaceful argument, the President is de
termined that the Cuban army shall j
disband, and should it fail to do so after â 
payment is made, he then considers '
that he will have full authority by law
to use force in accomplishing the pacifi
cation of the island.

We have seen many benefits arising
from the last jubilee under the Pontifi

manifestations occurred in Rome, making
the city a veritable ground of God.
In spirit let us recall the crowd of pil

orators who spoke to the public, the Pon

ing examples of piety and charity.
Alas! these thoughts carry with them
grief, seeing the present time so differ

Rome is so changed. Let us hope, how

his glory, wherein we desire nothing other

the necessity of the time.
One cannot say this century has been
sterile In good works and Christian vir

God. we have an abundance of illustrious
I examples. There are no exalted virtues
: in which many men have not signalized
â  themselves, because the Christian religion '
has obtained from God continued fruition
! of these virtues.
At the same time, what blind errors

; running toward eternal ruin! What grief
for our hearts to see how many Chrlst
i ians, seduced by license of thought, are
i losing every day the great gift of faith!
i It is difficult to express what injury* these
i habits of thought have ini.icted upon the
foundations of society.
Rebellious souls, full of bad tendencies

It Is necessary, then, to recall to men
i their duties, to succor perishing souls, to
, recall thought of eternal salvation to all j

those who at every hour run the danger
of losing the heavenly portion offered | to
them. This is the aim of the Holy Year,
as the tender mother church will try dur- j
ing this period to discipline souls, to teach |
them expiation through penitence.
With this principle she will multiply her i
prayers to the calm outraged majesty of
heaven to obtain abundance of heavenly .
gifts. In opening treasures of Indulgences j
whereof it Is the dispenser, the church in- \
vites the whole of Christendom to the
hope of pardon.
Why ought we not to hope for good re
sults if the people prepare themselves i
spontaneously to honor Christ by cele- ;
brating the end of the century?
We cannot propose anything holier or ;
more salutary for men. or more of what
men ought to desire, aspire to and hope
for. than to ask from Jesus throughout
this holy year for that salvation found ;
in his resurrection, in abandoning which j
men go to perdition.
I Alas! Many men refuse with contempt
this saving mercy. We have seen in these i
latter times a renewal of the Arlan j
heresy regarding the divinity of Jesus.
But have courage and let us to odr

these proposals by examples of piety,
joining in teaching to people what is ne
cessary, detesting every form of impiety
against the divine majesty of Jesus.
Raising our eyes to God, with his help
and with the approbation of the cardinals, |
we order a universal jubilee, to commence '
in this sacred city of Rome with the first

on the same day in 1900.
During the jubilee year we concede full :
indulgence and pardon of sins to all |
Christians truly r.epentajit who confess i
their sins and partake of communion, and j
who will visit the Basilicas of St. i
Peter's. St. Paul's. St. John's or that of j
Santa Maria Maggiore, in Rome, at least
once a day during twenty days, if having I
domicile in Rome, or, for pilgrims, dur
ing ten days. All ought to pray for the I
exaltation of the church, for the extlrpa
tlon of heresies, for a concord of Catho
lic princes, and for the salvation of Chris
tian peoples.
Those who through sickness or other
legitimate causes cannot visit the Roman ,
Basilicas, if they confess and communi
cate, may also benefit in the indulgence.
To Rome we invite you, with love, sons
of church, throughout the world.
At the same time good Catholics ought,
during this period, to renounce all spec
tacles of a profane character.
Divine Rome will inspire you. Jesus has !
chosen Rome as the center of the highest
action. Here is his empire. Here under \
his will is the immovable seat of his vicar
on earth. Here is guarded the truth.
From here spreads light to all the world, j
Whoso removes himself from Rome re- I
moves himself from Jesus.
Religious monuments, majestic temples, i

Rome.

Strong Stand of Western
Labor Union.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, Utah. May 13.â The
Western Labor Union has practically
completed labors in the convention held
during the past week. To-day the offi
cers for the ensuing term were elected,
and nearly all other business except the
final adoption of the constitution was
dispensed of. The president and vice
president were elected by acclamation
and without division. For the other offi
cers there was a spirited but friendly
contest.
The election of officers took place this
morning. The present president, Dan
McDonald of Butte, was re-elected
president for the ensuing term by ac
clamation and without the division.
Vice President John Troxel of Cripple
Creek was elected in the same way. M.
J. Geeger of Butte was elected secre
tary and treasurer.
It was decided to hold the next con
vention in one year from now at Den
ver. The vote for the place of the next
annual meeting stood: Denver 33,
Wallace 16, Butte 14.
The executive committee Is composed !
of Delegates Nash of Spokane; Eak- !
man of Wallace, Idaho; Lane of Crip
ple Creek; Farrar of Alberta, Canada,
and McPhee of Cripple Creek. The
president and vice president are ex
offlcio members of the same committee. ;
On the subject of the Cover d'Alene
mining troubles the following preamble
and resolution was adopted:
Whereas. It has come to the knowledge 1
of this convention that the Governor of
Idaho has so far forgotten his oath of
office and honor as a man as to turn the
executive branch of the government of
the State over to the owner of the Bunker
Hill and Sullivan mines, who. through his
attorneys and a pliant general of the
regular army, has established conditions
in the Coeur d'Alene mining region far
worse than ever existed In Russian Si
beria or on Cuban soil during the Spanish
reign of terror; and
Whereas. It Is a fact that American
liberty and the constitution of our coun
try have been supplanted by a military
despotism in its worst form, wherein the
owners of silver mines in the Coeur ;
d'Alene district are denied the right of
employing any man unless he first makes
affidavit that he is a non-union miner; and
Whereas, Many other citizens, including
prominent business men of the district
who are guilty of no crime other than
that they have expressed their sympathy
with the miners in their righteous strug- ;
gle for the very* existence of their organi
zation, have also been denied the right of
counsel and the actual necessities of life;
and
Whereas, The Western Labor Union
believes this state of affairs to be a men
ace, a strike at the very institution of
American liberty, that priceless jewel
gained by our forefathers after so much
suffering, privation and the shedding of
their blood on the field of battle that we ,
might be free; therefore be it
Resolved, By the Western Labor Union
in convention assembled that we con
demn every public official responsible for
the abrogation of civil law in Idaho, from
President McKinley through his Secre
tary- of War down to Governor Steunen
berg and Coroner France; and be it fur
ther >.;:
Resolved, That this convention call
upon organized labor of the American
continent to enter their mighty- protest ;
and condemnation at such unwarranted
tyranny, and the effort now being made
to reduce the standard of labor to the
level of serfdom: and be it further
Resolved, That this organization hereby ;
pledges Its assistance, both moral and
financial, to the Western Federation of
Miners in their fight for justice.

EXCITING
TUMULT IN
WALL STREET
Speculators Madly Rush to
Sell the Favorite Stocks
of Flower.
- Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. May 13.â Former Gov
ernor Flower's sudden death at East
port, L. 1., Friday night, created the
most exciting tumult that Wall street
has seen for nearly twenty years when
the stock market opened this morning.
Speculators tumbled over one another
in their haste to dispose of industrial
stocks in which he was the dominant
power. Heavy holders in what are
known as Flower stocks felt that the
most important factor in their market
was gone.
In the early hours it was a period of
great interest and anxiety. There was <
a tendency to wildneas in the general
market, but nothing like to the same !
extent in the Flower interests. The
shrinkage on Flower stocks is estimated ;
to be more than 118,000,000, and the gen
eral loss outside of these stocks about
$100,000,000. Some of the more conserva
tive brokers advised their customers not
to be in a hurry to sell Flower stocks.
Many persons took this advice after
a while. Rapid Transit, which had
been Governor Flower's favorite stock
for the last two years, was sold as soon
as the gavel fell to the extent of 2-,00.
shares.
Trading was so wild that brokers act- !
ing for the same firm, one executing
buying orders and another selling, made
transactions seven points apart. Prob
ably never has there been such a white
heat of excitement among customers as
was witnessed during the first half hour
of business.
"Manhattan opening sales 1000 at 100,"
shouted a man at the ticker in one of j
the broker's offices. This was the first I
quotation to come out. It had closed the j
day before at 111 3 -..
"Great Scott," replied one of the by- |
standers, "five and three-quarters off. i
What will Brooklyn be if Manhattan is :
affected that way?" All waited with
keen expectancy for the first Flower
stock. r;>:" ..'-./:
"Brooklyn Rapid Transit, 25.000
shares, opened at 110 to 100," cried the
man at the ticker. "Whew, that's only
IS\_ points off. Federal Steel, 11,000
shares, 66 to 50. That's ll 1 -* points off
from yesterday," and so they went.
People's Gas sold ail the way from 112
to 104 on the first sales. It had closed
at 119 the day before. This, next to
Brooklyn, was Governor Flower's fa
vorite. Just 10,000 shares of this stock
were dumped on the market all at once.
Outside of the Flower issues other
sharp breaks occurred in American
Steel and Wire, which lost 9 points at
the opening; in Metropolitan Street
Railway, which lost 7 points; Atchison
preferred, 33V and in many of the
highly speculative industrials. New
York Air Brake, which is also one of
the Flower favorites and which had the
most remarkable rise of any stock on
the list, did not come out for a few
minutes, and traders could hardly be
lieve their eyes when the first sale was
made at 155. as against ISS the previous
day, a break of 30 points. Then it went
tearing down 5, 10 and even 15 points
between sales until it struck 125, or 6*)
points below the previous day's closing.
Amid the frenzy of the unfortunate
traders, whose holdings were thrown
over because their margins had been
"wiped out," many investors jumped
in and seized the opportunity to pick
up bargains. This fact, and the sup
port of strong pools, saved the situa
tion from what otherwise might have
proved the most disastrous panic that

THE PROBLEM SOLVED.
THE NEW MEDICAL DISCOVERY
TESTED.
i
Results of the Test in Various Forms
of Dyspepsia.
Chronic indigestion or dyspepsia,
while a very common trouble, has for
some time been looked upon by able
physicians as a very serious thing, arrd
that no time should be lost in treating
it properly at the start, because recent
; researches have shown that the most
serious, fatal and incurable diseases
have their origin in simple dyspepsia
or indigestion.
Diabetes is simply one form of indi-
gestion, the sugar and starchy food not
being assimilated by the digestive or-
gans. In Bright's disease the albumen
is not properly assimilated.
While consumption and dyspepsia
are twin diseases it is beyond question
that dyspepsia makes a fertile soil for
the seeds of consumption.
'â¢ But the trouble has been to find a
remedy that could be depended upon to
cure dyspepsia, as It is notoriously ob-
stinate and difficult to cure.
This has been the question which
has puzzled physicians and dyspeptics
alike, until the question was solved
three years ago by the appearance of
the new dyspepsia cure in the medical
world known as Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, which It was claimed was a
certain reliable cure for every form of
stomach trouble. _-*."-".-
Physicians, however, would not ac-
cept such statements without first giv-
ing the new remedy many tests and
carefully observing results.
For three years the remedy has been
thoroughly tested in every section of
the country and with surprising and
satisfactory results.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can hon-
estly be claimed to be a specific, a radi-
cal, lasting cure for indigestion in the
various forms of acid dyspepsia or sour
stomach, gas or wind on the stomach,
too much bile, undue fullness or depres-
sion after eating md similar symotoms
c resulting from disordered digestion.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets were not
placed before the public until this
three \ years' trial left no doubt as to
their value and they have recently been
placed in the trade and can be found
at all druggists a_t the nominal price of | j
:50 cents per package. : i- *.-<;
No false claims are made for the
remedy. It will" not cure rheumatism,
pneumonia, typhoid fever nor anything
but just what it is claimed to cure and
that is every form of stomach trouble.
No dieting is necessary, good whole-
', some food and plenty of it and you may
j rest assured that Stuart's Dyspepsia
' Tablets will digest it.
Drugeists claim for it that it is , a
i pleasure to recommend it to dyspeptics,
because it gives such universal satis-
faction.

STARTS A RUSH
Placer Strike in Lower
California.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, May 13.â since the
days of the Almo excitement in Lower
California has there been such a stam
pede of men to a new placer camp as
that which is now under way to the
Santa Clara diggings, 400 miles south of
this city, and fifteen miles back from
the coast. Superintendent Swayne of
the Ibarra Gold Mining Company at
Calmaiii, sent a runner 200 miles to the
telegraph office at San Quintin with a
message to the agents of the company
in this city, notifying them that the
200 or more men in the company's em
ploy had gone to the Santa Clara dig
gings, leaving Calmaiii* deserted, and
in consequence the Ibarra mines have
been closed.
The principal reason for the sending
of the dispatch was to notify the com
pany's agents here not to ship machin
ery' and freight for Calmaiii on the
steamer St. Denis, which sails to-night,
for no means of getting it from the
landing at Santo Domingo to Calmaiii.
a distance of sixty miles, would be
available, all the men having struck out
for the new diggings.
Santa Clara is a sparsely settled part
of Lower California and has no means
of communication with the outside
world except by trail to Calmaiii and to
Santo Domingo, where the steamer St.
Denis touches every month.
The first reports of the placer discov
ery were brought up by the schooner
Anita two or three weeks ago. At that
time there were said to be 800 men in
the new diggings, many having gone
from Santa Rosalia, on the gulf coast.
Several men at Los Angeles and Santa
Ana, Cal., have made arrangements to
go to Santa Clara, sailing from here for
San Rogue Bay. The diggings are only
fifteen miles inland from that landing.
Perished in Bering Sea.
SUISUN, May 13. â Deputy Sheriff
George B. Donaldson to-day learned that
his brother, Albert 1.. Donaldson, was re
ported as one of a party of three lost in
Bering Sea. Donaldson and two other
men left in a rowboat to hunt. The boat
was afterward found, but the men were
missing. Donaldson lived here about
eight years. For nine or ten years he
has followed seal hunting, and made sev
eral cruises in northern seas.

BY IAN MACLAREN
NEW YORK. May 13.â Rev. Dr. John
Watson (lan Maclaren) arrived in this
city to-day after a three months' lecture
tour in Western States. Dr. Watson says
that he had been greatly Impressed with
evidences of the fertility and resources of
the far West.
"This my first trip to the far Western
States of this country," he said, "and I
cannot say too much in their praise. I
was particularly pleased with California.
I think the climate of this section of the
country surpasses that of Italy, and: as
far as its fertility goes. I know that
there is no country on earth that sur
passes it. But the West as a whole is an
exceedingly j fertile country, and I can
now see what part it plays in the vast
pros: - of these United States. Th
\Ve--t Is the country on which these East
ern cities dene: largely for their re
sources, on whiph the wealth of the East
is based."

STRIKERS
DUPED BY
LEADERS
Did Not Know the Wardner
Mills Were to Be De
stroyed.
ONLY .1 FEW GUILTY
Evidence That Smith and Cheyne
Were Murdered Because They
Drew Back.
Special Dlsratch to The Call.
WARDNER, Idaho. May 13.â The
most important developments of the
Coeur d'Alene strike situation are the
disclosures made by members of the
Miners' Union, who formed the mob
that blew up the Bunker Hill and Sul
livan mill. Through statements made
to the prosecuting officers evidence has
been secured to convict over 100 ring
leaders, some for destruction of prop
erty and arson and others for the mur
der of Smith and Cheyne. The men who
will turn State's evidence ask immunity
from punishment as accessories and
that they be given protection from the
friends of the leaders.
Another Important development Is
that Smith, and perhaps Cheyne also,
were murdered by members of the
union instead of being accidentally
shot, as was supposed. Smith had
been looked upon for some time as a
traitor and threats had been made
against his life by union associates.
" he day the mob started to Wardner
Smith tried to beg off, but the officers
refused to relieve him. When the mob
arrived he was placed on duty in a
certain position and some one shot him
in the back at short range. The assas
sin was concealed in the brush near by. ,
The State is preparing a strong case
and a half dozen or more hangings may
follow.
It is growing more and more certain
that the plot to wipe out the Bunker
Hill and Sullivan mill was inspired by
a dynamiting clique which centered j
around the Central Union at Wallace,
the miners' organization in the Coeur
d'Alenes, which dominated the rank and
file of the union Central Union at Wal- |
lace is made. up of three delegates each
from Burke, Gem, Mullan and Ward- !
ner. It had long been under suspicion ;
of inspiring the outbreaks which th"
miners here have periodically made.
Testimony being heard before the Coro
ner's jury is confirming that belief, and
it appears a majority of the union men
whose adherence tee the dynamiting
policy of th" ringleaders could not be
depended upon were kept in ignorance
of th" coming destruction of the mill at
Wardner. It was given out that Canyon
Creek miners were perpetrating such
outrages as might be committed at
Mullan. On th" other hand, it was an
nounced the Wardner strikers desired
only the moral assistance of their
brethren.
Under these representations the dyn
amiters herded together all the union
men in the' Coeur d'Alenes and terror
ized them Into a move against the Bun
ker Hill mill, using their numbers as a
foil for frightening away any possible
defenders of the property. Then, while
the crowd stood by in Ignorance, the
anarchists among them, 140 strong,
went forward, armed and masked, to
the wrecking of the plant and the kill
ing of Smith and Cheyne. A murderous
company of 140 riflemen represented the
total strength of the dynamiting crowd
in the union. The others, to the number
of 1000, who had arrived on the stolen
train, were, almost without exception,
ignorant of what the- ringleaders in
tended to do.
Now the work of sifting out the mob
leaders is commencing. Already evi
dence is accumulating.

HUNTINGTON IS
ASSURED OF AID
Santa Barbara Wants
the Gap Closed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, May 13.âHunt
ington's threat to not close the Elwood-
Surf gap and the attitude assumed by
Land Owner Dreyfus still supply the
subject of conversation here. The
Chamber of Commerce, the right of
way committee and a great many land
owners are doing all in their power to
settle the difficulty and have forwarded
letters to Huntington, assuring him of
their aid in making the way clear.
They realize that Huntington has them
in his power, and also what a suspen
sion of construction will mean to this
section. Crops are poor and men need
employment.
Hon. Ellwood Cooper, who was chair- j
man of the railroad convention, com- j
posed of members from all coast coun- â 
ties, held at San Jose in 1890. has called
a meeting of the citizens of Santa Bar
bara County to be held in this city on
May 23. The object is to devise means
for settling the trouble between the
railroad officials and the land owners j
through whose lands the road must go. j
Mr. Cooper says:
"The company is on the ground with
all the paraphernalia for rapid work-
It is ready to place camps on every
ranch where there is much work to be '
done and to hurry it with a reasonable j
degree of economy. We must bestir j
ourselves to insure these facilities. The j
distress apparent in some of the neigh
boring counties, by reason of insuffi
cient rainfall, will help us in the work.
Teams and men can be procured to do
the grading, and while our interests'are
advanced these people will he helped by
the opportunity to earn something."
Mr. Cooper suggests that a commit
tee of citizens he appointed to settle
grievances on the part of land owners
and to receive notice from the railroad
builders in all cases where obstructions
are placed, the committee to have
power to adjust the differences.
EATING OF 'A TAMALE .
MAY RESULT IN DEATH
Miss Maude Hufford of Los Angeles
Suffering From Ptomaine
\\'/ ' Poisoning.
LOS ANGELES. May 13.â Miss Maude
Hufford, one of the handsomest and most
popular young women of this city, is bat- !
tling for life against one of the most dead- j
}ly diseases known to physicians. Ever
since Miss Hufford partook of a tamale |
last Saturday she has suffered groat i
agony. Dr. Lewis diagnosed her case as |
ptomaine poisoning, caused by spoiled |
meal In the tamale. Miss Hufford was
unconscious for four days. Yesterday she
was able to speak a Tew words, but she
jis still in a critical condition. The joints
i of her arms ami legs began to stiffen and
constant massage with hot alcohol be
came necessary. To keep her limbs plas
tic it is necessary to move and twist the :
joints every two hours. The nerves of
Miss Eiufford's eyes, according to Hr. j
Lewis, have become twisted, causing
double vision.
Miss Hufford's life hangs on a slender
thread. Her recovery depends upon her
ability to pass the crisis, which is expect
ed to be reached to-morrow night.
GUILTY OF MURDER
IN THE FIRST DEGREE
Abe Majors May Pay the Death Pen
alty for the Killing of Cap
tain Brown.
BRIGHAM CITY, Utah, May 13.â
verdict in the case of Abe Majors, the
murderer of Captain W. A. Brown of
Ogden. . was delivered this morning. It
was murder in the first degree, without
any recommendation for mercy. There
is nothing about the young prisoner to
indicate that he is a hardened criminal,
as reports from California and the evi
dence in the case indicate. The prisoner
expressed himself in regard to the out
come of the case, saying: â¢ â :<--:
"If death, I prefer, to be shot on the
spot where my brother died and then be
burled with him." â¢
Sentence will be pronounced on Tues
day next.
The prisoner gave his name as James
Morgan.
CRAWFISHERS FINED.
Men Arrested on Santa Cruz Island
Plead Guilty. :â¢'?â¢
. SANTA BARBARA, May 13.â The ver
dict of guilty against John Osterman, the
crawflsher, caused all the remaining craw
fishers who were awaiting trial to go be
fore Judge Wheaton to-day and enter
pleas of guilty. John Lind, whose trial
was held several days ago, the jury fail
ing to agree, pleaded guilty and together
with five others paid a fine of $50. The
three who pleaded guilty at first were re
leased on payment of $40 each. Those
fined , were F. F. Wadell, Henry Oliver,
A. J. Kilgore, George Cousins, John Ba
ker, Peter Lind and John Osterman.
Representatives of the San Pedro Can
ning Company were in the city to-day,
and it was on their advice that the men
pleaded guilty. It is understood the com
pany, will bring suit against the county for
having held these men under arrest, as it
claims the waters about the islands are
not under the jurisdiction of the county.

He left a note addressed to his father,
announcing his intention to embark on a
career of crime and apologizing for not
informing him in person of his determi
nation.
"if know they intend to do something
desperate," lugubriously remarked Hohn
Sr. when telling his troubles to Sergeant
Meetlitt. one of Chief Lees' confidential
clerks, last night. "Both my son and Hill
are addicted to the pernicious habit of
reading dime novels of thrilling adven
tures and in a short time they became
! imbued with the idea that, like the he
| roes In the yellow novels, they could hold
up a stage with impunity and get away
: with the treasure.
"I suspecte ( something wrong, but it
was not until my son disappeared from
i home that it dawned upon me that he
had decided to lead a career of crime. On
returning home on the day of his disap
| pearance I found a note addressed to me.
, and at once recognized the handwriting
as that of my son. 1 hastily tore open
-, the envelope and after glancing, at Its
contents realized that my boy had de
cided to forsake the path of honesty to
lead a life of sham,- and dishonor. The
note stated that he had grown tired of
home restraint and intended to seek 'pas
tures new.' I would not care, only that
the concluding paragraph read that he
and Hill had purchased firearms and had
decided to emulate the heroes of the
dime novel literature. Â§
"1 am satisfied that the boys are bent
1 on holding up a stage or a railroad train.
My son further wrote that he was go
' ing to San Diego and would not return
: for seven months; that on his return he
would have money to burn. He advised
me not to worry about him, as he knew
enough to keep out of jail."
HEAVY UPSETS ON

The sports who attend the coursing
meetings at Union Park and who arc sup
posed to be good judges of form and know !
a thing or two about the tricks of the ]
trade received some few -financial upsets
yesterday that will compel them to exer- j
cisc caution to-day, when the finals of the
open stake are run.
Feeling jubilant over the successes they .
achieved in winning snug little pots from \
the rundown of the extra stake which was j
the first on the card of the day's coursing,
the talent, 80-called, played the courses
heavily when the open- stake was intro
duced and pleasant sailing was the order
until the fourth course was rung up by
the little electric bell which connects |
1 the slipping department with the gam-
Ming department. Considerable coin was
deposited ln the poolboxes on Hadiwist |
beating Scout. The odds were 2 to 1
against Scout, and the joy of the pikers
j was great when the flag announcing the
| success of "the short end" dog was hoist- ! .

LODGE AND ASSEMBLY.
The Wt>rk of the Odd Fellows and the
Bebekahs Is Terminated.
The Grand Lodge of Odd Fellows closed;
its session at half-past 10 o'clock last
night. During the day a great deal of un
finished business was disposed of and in
the miscellaneous business the mileage
tax was fixed at 16 cents per capita, the
tax for the maintenance of the home 70
cents, payable in two . Installments, and
for the general fund 30 cents. The mile
age for the session amounts to $4692 85 and
the estimated expenses for the . current
year will be $12,000.
The four districts of the State were re
arranged so as to facilitate visitation.
The supreme representatives to the Sov
ereign Grand Lodge from the Grand
Lodge of California were requested to ask
the highest body of the order to allow
married daughters of Odd Fellows, whose
husbands are not members of the Odd
Fellows, and the sisters of Odd Fellows
to become members of the Rebekahs. The
assembly voted $500 to the Orphans' Home
Hospital fund and received a donation of
$20, which now makes that fund $1020.
The president, Mrs. Helen M. Carpen
ter, then announced the following ap
ointments: Mrs. Ada Madison of San
lego, marshal; Mrs. Sarah Wolff of Sac
ramento, conductor; Mrs: M. j Harvey of
Chico, chaplain; Mrs. Ret tie Hat ton of
Santa Barbara, inside guard, and Miss
Gussie Hooper of San Francisco, outside
guard. These and the officers who were
elected ; at a previous session were in
stalled under the new ritual by Mrs. Dell
C. Savage, the retiring president. Just
prior to singing "Auld Lang Syne," the
retiring and incoming officers were each

The Bohemian Club Will Purchase!
yy\'yy, Meeker's Grove. â 
The Bohemian Club at a meeting last
night decided to purchase* the * property
known as Meeker's Grove, situated five
miles from Guernevilfe. Sonoma County.'
The purchase price ($27,500) will be. raised
by the issuance of bonds bearing 4 per
cent interest. They will be known as
"sentimental" bondsâ that is. If they are
not paid at maturity the holders will al
low an extension of time .- for their re
demption. They . will : run twenty years.
The bonds' will be secured by amort
gage only on Meeker's Grove real estate
and not on any other property of the club'
In order to meet the obligation certain
sums of money from the income of the
club will be set aside as a redemption
fund. ;â¢_â â¢-.-._..-â â -. -r.
It was also determined that the club
will remain in its present quarters for
five years longer, a lease of that period
being taken up with the privilege of re
newing it for another five years. . The
present lease expires in January next.
The club intends to acquire the adja
cent building on Grant avenue for jinks
purposes. The premises now occupied by
Samuels' Lace House will be connected
by a bridge. The board of directors will
have full power to act in the matter of
the purchase of Meeker's Grove for mid
summer jinks purposes.
Director M. A. Newell when seen in re
gard to the proposition was sanguine that
the purchase will be consummated, as he
thinks that there are enough wealthy
members of the club to take up the
bonds.

FIELD OF SPORT
WHY COAST STREAMS
CONTAIN FEW TROUT
The Free Use of Dynamite Has De-
stroyed Thousands of Game
and Edible Fishes.
It is to be regretted that the dynamiter
can escape detection so easily. Of the
many fish and game fiends extant the
man who employs dynamite as a means
of killing fish is, to say the least, a mur
derer at heart.
A few weeks ago several dead trout
were found in Lagunitaa Creek within
close proximity to a camp of woodchop
pers. There cannot be the slightest doubt
that the men who are engaged in cutting
wood employ their leisure hours in dyna
miting the pools and killing fishes. Last
Sunday anglers who visited Point Reyes
expecting to- enjoy a few hours' good
sport catching trout in the deep pools
near the White House and Sandspit
learned that three or four Portuguese
ash-destroyers who visit a locality not
tar distant from the big pool yearly for
the purpose of bagging trout by a quick
process had dynamited the pool and taken
therefrom a large quantity of dead flsnes.
An Inspection was made along the banks
or the stream or lagoon by some of the
visiting anglers and several small dead
trout were discovered which had the ap
pearance of tish that had been destroyed
by an explosive.
It is to be hoped that the Supervisors
of the county at their next meeting will
ofTer a tempting reward for the capture
of dynamiters and that those who are
discovered in the act of killing fish lev
such Infernal means will receive the pun
ishment they are so richly entitled to. A
single stick of dynamite will kill every
nsh in the pool in which it is placed. It
can therefore i,.- easily imagined what the
amount of destruction a fiend can accom
plish with. say. one dozen sticks of dyna
mite on a trout stream.
It is pleasing to note that James J. Fal
lon, who was appointed game and fish
warden of the city and county of San
Francisco about six months ago, has at
last crept out of his hibernating quarters
and actually succeeded in making one ar
rest. Last Wednesday Mr. Fallon seized
about 500 pounds of striped bass that were
consigned to Mons. Paladin! , who is
known as the poachers' friend and bene
factor. The fishes were distributed among
the charitable institutions of the city
Now that Warden Fallon has broken the
Ice, so to speak, it is hoped that he will
continue the good work .me] by his acts
prove to the citizens and Supervisors of
this city that there is need for an indus
trious and wide-awake game warden In
this city and county. There are many
downtown restaurants transgressing the
game and fish laws by selling customers
both game and fish during all months of
the year. A bright gam.- warden could
materially put a stop to illegal business
of this kind and doubtless Warden Fallon
will soon he heard from again among the
restaurants and commission houses.
R. Terry and Frank Marcus caught a
beautiful basket of trout in Lake Lagunl
tas last Wednesday. The fish in the lake
are very game and are also rich in flavor.
â¢ I iiarcitos Lake is still open to anglers,
but the fishes that have been taken from
it are as dry at- a chip and by no means
gamy. .â¢.â ,;,,
Several fine striped bass were taken dur
ing the past week by anglers who fished
from the Oakland long bridge. Trolly
linos were used principally with hooks
that were baited with clam necks.
The following amusing letter on the
good fortune that is attached, or. rather,
goes with a rabbit's foot has been re
ceived from that well-known angler, Doc
Watt: "--.:..â * â¢',%â¢.
"*'â¢â¢â¢.-_". SAX FRANCISCO. May 12. 1599.
Sporting Editor of The Call-Dear Sir: A
rather amusing incident occurred in a Sutter
street rendezvous for sportsmen recently. It
seems that Prank Marcus when fishing on th"
Pescader.. In company with John Butler. Lloyd
Eaton and "Professor" Ferry, saw something
drop out of Butler's pocket, and on ; picking
it up It turned out to be a "rabbit's toot."
All sportsmen who are acquainted with John
Butler know him to have somewhat peculiar
fancies and superstitions, mor*- particularly so
when out on his fishing trips. He would np
more think of going on a fishing trip without
his "charm" than he would of casting a hook
into a pool minus a chunk of salmon roe.
When the subject of the "rabbit's foot" was
brought up by Marcus, Butler admitted that It
was given tee him on one of his Eel River
expeditions some fifteen years ago by a col
ored lady. He has carried it with him con
tinuously ever since, and believes that his suc
cess in fishing may be wholly attributed to
the "rabbit's foot."
"Professor" Terry could not understand, how
ever, why Butler lost so suddenly all Interest
In fishing at Pescaderee. The fact was John
had lost his "fishing partner," and wanted to
go home.
Marcus, not thinking anything of his "find,"
dropped the "charm" in his pocket and con
tinued on down stream. His luck changed as
If by magic, and during the balance of the
afternoon he remarked that "he- never had
such sport."
Butler's disconsolate mood and abject man
ner Induced Marcus to inquire eventually of
his brother angler why this sudden change
from his usually Jolly disposition. Butler re
plied: "Well, Frank, 1 have lost my 'rab
bit's foot,' " and at the same time, In one
of his own peculiar, half-masted gestures, he
exclaimed: "I wouldn't have lost that wench's
charm for $1000."
The well-known Irish comedian Joe Murphy
has won Butler's admiration by having prom
ised him a rabbit's foot which Joseph received
many years ago when on a visit to Ireland
from a fortune teller who lived In the town
of Rutlervllle. Th" actor contends that It will
bring money to Butler which he cannot spend,
however, on whisky or wine, even though he
may have a liberal Inclination. Yours truly,
THE DOC.
A CRICKET TEAM MAY
COME FROM THE SOUTH
This morning on the Webster street |
grounds, Alameda, the second match of
the season will be played between the Pa
cific and California cricket clubs. The
association has a rule that no member of
an affiliated club who may be delinquent )
ln his dues to his club may. play for an
other club until the arrears are paid up.
The Pacific eleven to-day will be aa fol
lows: J. Myers, George Theobald (cap
tain), C. Simmonds, (j. p. Coles. Fane
Sewell, J. J. Theobald. .1. H. Harbour, W.
McDonald. J. T. Bickerdike, H. P. G.
Gordon and A. W. Wilding. The repre
sentatives of the California Club will be i
chosen on the ground from the following: I
F. M. Gunn, W. K. Williams. H. S. Wig- I
fins, E. T. Randall. J. C. Robertson, li.
Schroeder. A. Willis. V. Beebeck, W.
Reeves. R. B. Jones, G. C. Fen-all, J. D. |
Carr, A. D. Reynolds, A. Dickinson, H. j
H. Cookson and E. <;. Sloman. V. See
beck and K. G. Sloman have played for
Alameda, and during the early part of I
last season A. Dickinson was one of the I
strongest bats of the Pacific eleven. H.
H. Cookson, A. D. Reynolds and W.
Reeves- were members of the old Bohe
mian Club. - i'iy-'.
There Is a good prospect that a new
club, the Los Angeles, will join the Cali- |
fornia Cricket Association. H. Jones-
Bateman, a member of that club, was In
this city during the past week on his way
to British Columbia, and stated that the ]
cricketers of Dos Angeles and vicinity
were desirous to bring a team up to San
Francisco later in the season, and that I
the Los Angeles. Club would affiliate it
self- with the- association.
The suggestion that arrangements ;
should be made for the Australian team j
which has' recently arrived in England to
play a match against a California team on I
its return to Australia Is not likely to â 
meet with favor, as the debt incurred on
the occasion of the visit of the Australian
eleven some' years ago hampered the as
sociation seriously and has even yet not
been entirely wiped off. Besides, no team
could be gathered in California that would
have the least chance of holding its own
against' an ordinary Australian eleven,
much less against what is considered the
strongest eleven that has ever represented
the colonies. â¢ i

ALL ABOUT TENNIS
PLAYS AND PLAYERS
Eastern Experts May Journey West
This Year to Try Out the
Native Sons.
Western players have always been lost
in a sea of doubt as to the relative posi
tions occupied by tennis cracks with
Eastern championship records and by
the Western men who have gained lau
rels on this coast. This year a strong
attempt will be made to bring out the
Eastern champions.
The biggest, tournament that the Cali
fornia Tennis Club has held in many
years will be played on . the club's
courts on Decoration day. It will be
a class singles tournament. There will be
three classes, the handicapping to be
done by the committee, W. Stauf act
ing for R. J. Davis. Robert N. Whitney
and Henry Weihe. . For each class prizes
have been donated. Rackets will go to
the lucky men who reach the finals. The
entries are coming in already, and there
Is every prospect of an old-time big tour
nament.
This afternoon at the Alameda Club the
following matches of the academic cham
pionship tournament will be played: Roth
against Dibert, Weihe against Brown,
Brummel and 'Jones against Weihe and
Roth. Drummond McGavin and Hooper
against Dibert and Brown.
GOLF PLAYERS WHO
ARE BOOKED TO MEET
T. W. Tetley, instructor of the San Raj
fael Golf Club, left Coronado some days
ago, but met with an accident at Bakers- j
rh-d and was compelled to remain there. I
The preparation of the schedule of events
for the season has been deferred until his
return to San Francisco. Several of the
San Francisco golfers are also members !
of the San Rafael Club, and will play on
the links there during the summer. The
annual meeting of the club will be held
in the clubhouse in San Rafael next Sat
urday. May 20. at 5 o'clock in the after
noon. The election of seven members, to
be known as the council, will be held at
the meeting. The present council con
sists of Richard A. Parker (captain), Car- I
ter P. Pomeroy (vice captain), Fred 11.
Green (secretary and treasurer), Mark L.
Gerstle. John J. Crooks, Frank S. John- j
son and James If. Wilkins.
John Lawson of the' Burlingame Club,
who is now in Scotland, has telegraphed
that he has engaged a professional for
the San Francisco Golf Club, who will
arrive in this city shortly. It is probable
that water will be piped to the putting
greens on the- Presidio course, which will
then be kept in excellent condition
throughout the year. Throughout South
ern California the putting-greens are not
really greens, being of hardened leveled
soil, and not of turf. The Presidio links
are almost the only ones in California In
which the course is of real spongy turf,
that holds the ball up and reduces the
risk of jarring the wrists and breaking
a club to a minimum. , ,-. . â  ...

THERE is nothing so penetrating, nothing so invigorating, nothing that will relieve weakness and pain as speedily and surely â , "~ M__jr
as Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt. It.is simple, but grand: It assists nature by a general re-enforcement of the vital L r ~fJT==jm

essence of nerve vigor and nerve strength. # -F 7 - _^^CV^SS_^.
Tho greatest men in the world of medicine and science say "ELECTRICITY IS LIFE." It is the strength, the vigor, ftÂ£gj|SB ife
and, in fact, the very life in the body, and Dr. McLaughlin's success in making use of its life-giving power proves its merit. %SS^^SH^ !
With his Electric Belt he has cured 10,000 weak men during the last five yearsâ men who had been troubled with general debit- raSS &
ity wasting weaknessâ men who had been able to get no benefit from drugs. Many of these cases were pronounced incurable TOr^^Sll i
by doctors who had failed to cure them. But they have been cured, and they stand ready to testify to it. I here must be merit -m~ W

the new barge built for the Dolphins by
Twigs. Three boatloads of Dolphins will
visit the Ariel Club house to-day. A. W.
Pape has decided to become a professional
sculler, and will try to secure a match

and Adam Schuppert,
At the last meeting of the South End
Rowing Club the following new members
were Initiated: J. J. Lermen, H. S.
Martin. J. J. Van Nostrand ami Herbert
Fishbeck. Ten new members were elected.
At the last meeting of the Alameda
Boating Club Richard Meserole, Sydney
Pollard and Leon David were elected
members. The creek oarsmen are mani
festing great activity. A club regatta
and jinks will be given toward the end of
June The committee In charge consists
of S. J. Pembroke, 11. . W. Maas, W. C .
Hansen, Arthur Hammersmith and C.
Pesoli. A new skiff and outrigged racing
skiff are to be obtained. The Alameda
men would like to have the champion
ship regatta held on the creek this year..
The money which the regatta committee
of the Pacific Association has on hand,
supplemented by a grant from the asso
ciation would be sufficient, with external
financial aid. The water In the creek is
almost always smooth and the opportuni
ties for seeing the race are much better
than at Long Bridge. John Lewis will
probably take E. Hadcock's place on the
bow thwart of the senior Alameda barge.
Mary Jackson Died.
Miss Mary Jackson, the young Woman
who Jumped from the window of a lodg

her injuries yesterday morning. She had
been sick for a long time and had been

GAME BIRDS THAT
WILL BE PROTECTED
Supervisors of Marin County Are Up
in Armsâ Olympic Gun Club
Preserve.
Now that curlew are plentiful along the
east shores of the bay sportsmen who
do not take ah Interest in trap-shooting
can enjoy a pleasant day's outing where
the longbills feed. Yesterday Tom John
son, Ben Andrews and "Billy" Ford made
a very good bag of birds on Bay Farm
Island, Alameda. The sportsmen will
visit the same grounds to-day, and they
expect to return with a large number of
birds, as they now understand how to
hunt them. The marshes near Mount
Eden are also favorite grounds of the
curlew, which is a good table bird after
its arrival from the north.
To-day the San Francisco Gun Club and
the Empire Gun Club will hold bluerock
shoots at Alameda Point. The San Fran
ciscos will hold possession of the grounds
in the forenoon. The Empires will com
mence the breaking of clays about 1
o'clock and the sport will continue until
late in the evening.
The Olympic Gun Club will meet at its
grounds near Ingleside and the grassing
of live birds will afford members a
pleasant afternoon's outdoor entertain
ment. Report , says that the Olympic
Gun Club may have a new inland game
preserve when the season for quail-shoot
ing will have arrived. Some of the lead
ing members of the club have been ne
gotiating with a farmer named Rogers,
who resides near Nicasio, in Marin
County, for the privilege of shooting
game, which of course includes deer and
quail, on his lands, if a lease can be
secured the members will certainly have
good inland hunting grounds as there
are large flocks of quail on the ranches
of Mclsaac and Rogers, because' of the
fact that outsiders have been prohibited
from decimating the flocks thereon. It
is not probable, however, that the club
will make any definite overtures to the
owner of the property in question until
it is learned what the Supervisors of
Marin County will accomplish at their
next meeting relative to the preservation
of game in their county. Doubtless the
Supervisors will permit of no more than
two months in which quail may be shot
next season, and it can be safely said
that the season will not open on October
l__th;it is. according to the State law.
With a knowledge of the fact that the
young October birds meet with a hot re
ception from certain individuals who call
themselves sportsmen, the Supervisors
will ordain that the season for quail
shooting will not open until November 1,
and doubtless they will also put a limit on
the number of birds tee be bagged by
hunters. The sale of quail and deer in
the county will be strictly prohibited, as
will also the shipment of game out of the
county. This ordinance will compel the
high-class hunter to pack his game if
he desires to return with it to this city.
An ordinance of a similar kind, it is said,
will be passed in the near future by the
Supervisors of Solano County. Evidently
the farmers and sportsmen of the in
terior are waking up to the fact that
game is sadly in need of protection.

Swamp-Root, the Great Kidney Restorative and Healer.
ITS MARVELOUS SUCCESS IN ALL KIDNEY, BLAD-
DER AND URIC ACID TROUBLES.
To Prove the Wonderful Merits of this New Discovery
Every "Call" Reader May Have a Sample
Bottle Sent Absolutely Free by Mail.
.
What your kidneys need is a gentle, healing, tonic influence
that will soothe their irritability and gently regulate them.
The only thing, that will do this is Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root,
the ideal Kidney Restorative.
It used to be considered that only urinary troubles were to
be traced to the kidneys, but now modern science proves that
nearly all constitutional diseases have their beginning in the dis-
order of these useful organs.
What more natural?
The kidneys filter and purify the blood.
When they don't your whole body
must suffer.
If you are sick, doctor your kidneys,
because as soon as they are well they
will help all the other organs to health.
The mild and extraordinary effect of
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the great
kidney remedy, is soon realized. It
stands the highest for its wonderful
cures of the most distressing cases, and
is sold by druggists in fifty-cent and
one-dollar bottles. Make a note of the
name, AMP-ROOT, Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root.
You may have a sample bottle of this
famous kidney remedy sent free by
mail, postpaid, by which you may test
its virtues for such disorders as kid-
ney, bladder and uric acid diseases, and
urinary troubles, obliged to pass water
frequently night and day. smarting or
irritation in passing, brickdust or sedi-
ment in the urine, constant headache,
backache, lame back, dizziness, sleep-
lessness, indigestion, nervousness, skin
trouble, anaemia, Bright's disease,
neuralgia, rheumatism, bloating, irri-
present from all over the coast and from
the East. The prizes amount to over
tability, worn-out feeling, lack of am-
bition, loss of flesh, sallow complexion.
If your water, when allowed to re-
main undisturbed in a glass or bottle
for twenty-four hours, forms a sedi-
ment or settling, or has a cloudy ap-
pearance, it is evidence that your kid-
neys and bladder need immediate at-
tention.
Swamp-Root has been tested in so
many ways, in hospital work, in pri-
vate practice, among the helpless too
poor to purchase relief, and has proved
so successful in every case, that a spe-
cial arrangement has been made by
which all readers of The Call, who have
not already tried it, may have a sam-
ple bottle sent absolutely free by mail.
Also a book telling more about Swamp-
Root and containing some of the thou-
sands upon thousands of testimonial
letters received from men and women
who owe their good health, In fact,

HOW TO SUPPRESS PUBLIC GAMBLING
ONCE more the efforts of the police to procure
the conviction and punishment of the pro
prietor of a saloon where poker game gam
bling is carried on have failed. The jury in the Horn
kin case disagreed, there being but one juror for con
viction to eleven for acquittal.
This mistrial, following the ill success of former at
tempts to obtain convictions, is undoubtedly a sub
ject for no little regret. It makes clear the fact that
there are many Police Court jurors whose sympathies
with the gamblers are such that anything will serve
them as a doubt on which to base a reason for re
fusing to convict. It once more reveals to the public
the stumbling-block in the way of the police, and
shows the difficulties they have to contend with in
enforcing municipal ordinances.
The failure of the courts, however, does not ex
haust the power of the law in such matters. The Po
lice Commissioners have authority to refuse a license
tc any saloon-keeper who maintains a place where the
violation of law is abetted or connived at. That au
mority they should exercise in the case of all keepers
of saloons where poker games are openly carried on.
A wholesome fear of the loss of license would soon
put an end to the kind of gambling that has been too
long tolerated in some of the most noted resorts of
our principal thoroughfares.
It is gratifying to learn in the meantime that the
prosecution of the persons arrested in the recent raids
on the poker dens will be continued. It may yet be
possible to obtain a jury that will convict, and even
one case of severe punishment will be a salutary les
son to the gang. Under any circumstances the law
officers should never cease to pursue the gamblers as
long as they continue to violate the ordinances of the
city and mock at morality.
SALISBURY'S DIPLOMACY.
CLOSELY following the announcement of the
agreement between Great Britain and Russia
with respect to China comes the news of the
ratification by the French Chamber of Deputies of the
Anglo-French convention regarding the Nile and
Niger territory. Thus the dangers which threatened
British interests and the peace of the world in Asia
and in Africa have been avoided for a time at least,
and Lord Salisbury has given another proof that his
diplomatic skill has not been weakened by advancing
age.
The convention agreed upon between Great Britain
and France with reference to the disputed territory
in Central Africa is ofl the face of it, so far as re
ported, a triumph for France, but the result is very
sure to be to the advantage of the British. By the
convention Great Britain is confirmed in possession
of the Nile from the sea to the lakes, but France is
to have full rights of free trade up and down the
river and throughout the Soudan. The right of un
restricted trade is what French diplomacy has gained,
but it is doubtful if French commerce will be able to
profit by it in competition not only with British
rivalry but with that of the rest of the world, for of
course the British policy will be to open the country
to the commerce of all nations.
The real benefit to France from the treaty is the
settlement of the controversy without war. France
is confirmed in possession of a larger domain in
Africa than is held by any other power. It opens on
the Mediterranean and on the Atlantic, and in extent
is a giant empire. It docs not, however, touch the
Nile. Great Britain is in a position to so extend her
African possessions as to control a route for Cecil
Rhodes' projected railway from the Cape to Cairo.
France has the more land, but the British have- the
trade avenues up and down the continent, and it can
hardly be doubted which will be the dominant power
in Africa a hundred years from now.
A dispatch from Santa Barbara announces that
Dreyfus stands in the way of Huntington. The date
line is the only thing that saves one from the sus
picion that the old railway king had seized Devils
Island in pursuit of his policy to grab everything in
sight.

MILITARY IMPERIALISM.
WHEN property to the value of $300,000 was
blown up by dynamite in Idaho by a large
number of persons claiming to constitute a
Miners' Union The Call denounced the outrage and
demanded that the authorities use all the force that
might be necessary to vindicate the law and to sup
press violence. It is evident that the fundamental
doctrine of legal equality under a constitutional Gov
ernment demands that no licenses to perpetrate
crime, whether by the rich or by the poor, whether
in South Carolina, in Idaho or anywhere else, should
b< recognized.
But The Call did not suppose, when the Governor
of Idaho called for military assistance from the Fed
eral Government, that under the pretext of suppress
ing riotous demonstrations the Federal and the State
constitutions would be substantially trodden under
foot and a practical illustration of imperialism fur
nished within the limits of an autonomous State. The
manner in which the difficulty was handled by General
Merriam and the Governor combined was almost as
illegal as .the violent conduct of the rioters them
selves. It was in effect the unnecessary substitution
cf military for civil government, of despotism for
freedom. The opinion of General Merritt that the
constitution has been "outgrown," his eulogy of
Secretary Alger, with his peculiar methods, as greater
than the world-renowned War Secretary of our inter
necine conflict, sounded harshly to the ears of edu
cated Americans, loyal to their national institutions.
But the conduct of General Merriam and the chief
executive of Idaho brings home to the country with
realistic significance what imperialism actually means.
The ninth section of article I of the Federal con
stitution declares: "The privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in
cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may
require it." This great writ of right cannot be sus
pended by the President himself, except under the
authority of an act of Congress, as has been repeat
edly decided by the Supreme Court of the United
States. Yet, according to the news dispatches, when
General Merriam had an overwhelming force under
his command, and without even a temporary neces
sity, nominally under State authority but as the re
sult of an agreement with the Federal General, the
writ was suspended and martial law declared. Again,
the first amendment to the Federal constitution de
prives Congress itself of the power of "abridging the
freedom of speech or of the press." Yet General
Merriam assumed the right to establish a press cen
sorship. And, still further, miners as well as capital
ists are legally authorized to unite for their own pro
tection and to exert the power of combination to
maintain the rate of wages. But, unless the news
reports, are false, this elementary principle has been
repudiated by General Merriam, and the condition
for the resumption of work at Wardner enforced that
no member of the Miners' Union shall be employed.
These manifestations of practical imperialism have
been virtually unrebuked by the annexation or im
perialistic press. The advocates of a colonial system
abroad cannot well denounce arbitrary misgovern
ment at home. The Call has held rigidly to the
American system and has insisted upon the suprem
acy of the constitution and the laws and upon legal
equality among all citizens on every foot of land that
belongs to the United States. It has supplied full
and unanswerable arguments and illustrations show
ing the vital necessity of maintaining our system and
derived from law-writers, from cases, from the Fed
eral records and from authentic history. Journals
that support imperialism have not found and cannot
discover any logical or truthful answer. They limit
themselves to the endless repetition of manufactured
falsehoods, and do not even pretend to assign any
reason, beyond some ridiculous "national policy," for
departure from established principles and from land
marks hitherto consistently upheld by statesmen, by
jurists, by military and by naval officers, and by the
mass of the American people. We have looked in
vain for any intellectual or moral appeal, resting upon
truth, to the minds or to the hearts of American citi
zen?, in favor of the revolutionary and treasonable
policy that has been blatantly advocated for the bene
fit of speculators and of incipient Napoleons, uncon
scious of their own limitations.
The spectacle in Idaho is an experimental example
of the effect of imperialistic tendencies that can
scarcely remain unnoticed.
fIN INVIOLATE REPUBLIC
THE more European complications are studied
the more complete becomes the justification of
the founders of this republic in confining govern
ment within its legitimate sphere and the more inde
fensible the efforts of American imperialists to impress
European ideas upon our tested and successful insti
tutions.
The problem before the thirteen colonies when re
sistance to the exactions of George 111 became not
merely indispensable to their security but a duty to
the human race was most complicated and most em
barrassing. Some converging point upon which they
could unite had to be discovered. They were per
vaded by deeply religious but diverse and clashing
sentiments, and by. hereditary descent and by the uni
form pressure of European education and practice
they had been familiarized with the interpenetration
of politics and religion. There had been isolated and
not unfrequent approaches in most of the colonial
administrations toward the removal of restraints upon
religious and political activities, but for two centuries
or more the reconciling life that the world awaited
struggled in the womb of indefinite expectancy.
The great Americans of the eighteenth century
solved the problem and achieved their purpose. They
struck the tocsin of ephemeral despotism and the key
note of durable government when, by the Declaration
of Independence, they proclaimed the inalienability of
the natural endowments of men, and when, by the
Federal constitution, they divorced church and state,
restricted political interference with personal liberty to
the minimum, stamped intolerance and bigotry into
the dust, inoculated a nation with the moral principles
and rules in which civilized men concurred, and
swung before the astonished eyes of mankind a Union
of autonomous States, where all men were free and
equal' in opportunity and before the law, and which
were held to their glowing center as the planets to the
sun..
For a hundred and twelve years the American Gov
ernment, stripped of perplexing complications and
religiously neutral except in the realm of universal
morality, has proved its superiority over all previous
and contemporaneous plans for the protection of lib
erty and the development of orderly society. It has
attracted and unified the best strains of blood in the
human race. It has illuminated a continent with edu
cation and with progressive intelligence. Without
sacrificing principle it has enlarged its domain
by the erection of new States. It has multiplied every
form of wealth "beyond the dreams of avarice." It
has steadily gained in strength, in discipline and in
power. By its self-concentration it has avoided the
entanglements of erudite and artificial diplomacy. â â¢ By
'its adherence to a simple but wonderfully harmonious
constitution it has lightened the burden of humanity
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 14, 1899.
and allowed the freest play to those soaring faculties
that, for thousands of years, were repressed by the
superincumbent weight of institutions that falsely.as
serted a divine" origin and inspiration.
This majestic progress would have been impossible
under imperialism, and, even under a democratic
system, would have been quickly checked, but for the
complete elimination of the elements of dogmatic con
troversy and the -legation of every issue that did
not affect man in his earthly and in his political rela
tions to the sphere of private life and of those organ
izations that train the soul for its final destiny. The
American theory embraces all the simplicities and all
the unities of civilized mankind, but leaves the un
fettered spirit to its own associations and to its own
aspirations. Where the diversified phases of religious
life begin the function of government ends.
The British tendency is toward disestablishment, al
ready perfected in Ireland. In other parts of Europe
the same inclination is perceptible. But generations
must pass away and perhaps centuries elapse before
the rooted complexities of the past can be disen
tangled and a harmonious separation and adjustment
of ecclesiastical and political jurisdiction effected.
Meanwhile, unless internally convulsed through cor
rupt ambition and civic apathy, unless dragged back
from our high ideals and yoked to the prowling mon
sters of despotism, unless our young manhood turns
away from its trained Americanism, scents the blood
of racial inferiority and joins the rush of nations for
the plunder of torrid disintegration, this mighty re
public will rise and spread, through the leaven of
American civilization, until the earth shall be filled
with its glory as the waters cover the sea.
MORE TROUBLE BREWING.
IT is a far cry "from New York to Syria. Since
the inspiration of Mahomet overthrew the Greeks
in that country it has been under Mahometan
domination* and has long formed a part of the Turk
ish empire. ,
It is now announced that a Syrian junta has been
formed in New York, representing the Syrian immi
grants who have become citizens of the United
States, which has been gathering means to begin a
Syrian revolution against Turkey. The president of
this junta declares that they intend to proceed on the
lines followed by the Cuban junta, to work up Ameri
can sympathy and support, and by means of secret
organizations in Asia Minor to start a widespread
outbreak, in the expectation that the Armenians will
rise at the same time and put Turkey -between two
fires.
Until recently it was an exhibition of Americanism
worthy of applause to express sympathy with any peo
ple anywhere who were willing to fight for liberty
and self-government on the soil on which they were
born. It was this genuine Americanism that inspired
the Spanish war to give civil order and self-govern
ment to the subject peoples of that kingdom. In
view of our record in the Philippines it is becoming
somewhat hazardous for an American to airy more
manifest such sympathy. But, leaving consistency
one side, is there not room for doubt as to the pro
priety of permitting this country to be made the
breeding place of foreign revolutions?
Turkey is one of the family of nations. We are at
peace and on terms of amity with her. While
American interests there are not large, they have
some significance and should be thought of.
But when we encourage a revolution in Turkey
there are other things to be thought of than the im
mediate effect upon that country. Every Govern
ment on the globe is interested in the tranquillity of
the Mahometan world. There are nearly three hun
dred millions of that faith in the world. Two mil
lions of them are in the Philippine Islands. When
the faith of the Prophet was but a grain of mustard
seed, compared to the millions who professed Chris
tianity. Islam nearly overran Europe. It has been
said that if the armies of the Caliphs had not been
driven back over the Pyrenees at the battle of Tours,
where Martel overcame Abderraman, the world would
now be Mahometan and the Koran would be ex
pounded in the universities of Germany, France, Eng
land and the United States.
No one admits that Mahometanism can do in - the
dry stick the mighty things done in the green, but it
is a fighting faith and has the power to disturb the
world by bloodshed unequaled in modern times. The
craft and courage which once ruled the world, from
the Pyrenees to the Himalayas, set up the empire of
the Moguls and spread to the islands that mark the
eastern boundary of the Indian Ocean, are by no
means exhausted. In spite of her errors of internal
administration, Turkey, standing to the modern mind
a. the representative of Islam, has held her own by
dint of fighting,* and her army, for its size, is the
finest in the world.
If the United States permit the brewing of this
Syrian revolution we are permitting to be lighted a
torch that will start a conflagration to profoundly dis
turb the world. The Sultan is not the spiritual head
of the Mahometan faith. That office is held by the
Shick ul Islam, a descendant of the Prophet, who
alone by unfurling the green banner has the power to
declare a holy war. If the provocation come from a
Christian nation, the most appalling results may fol
low. The six hundred millions of Asiatics and Afri
cans, of other non-Christian faiths, who are by no
means enamored of Christian imperial methods, may
easily ally themselves with Islam, and the fi high
proclamation of a Syrian republic may light a con
flagration from Marmora to the Yellow Sea.
There are doubts whether such responsibility is to
be properly assumed by the United States. Already
we have given shelter to a series of conspiracies
against Governments with which we were at peace.
The last one has involved us in an expenditure in one
year of three quarters of a billion dollars and the loss
of many lives, and the end is not yet.
Encouraging with our sympathy a distant people
struggling for liberty is one thing. ' Permitting the
organization of revolution by conspiracy on our own
soil against a friendly Government is quite another.
That an unmuzzled press has illimitable power for
good has been shown beyond all doubt in the Dreyfus
case. Revision is no more certain than the fact that,
had there been no Figaro willing to fly in the face
;of oppressive laws aimed at the newspapers, there
would have been no revision. Members of the late
i California Legislature and their admirers, please take
note.

season of 1900, but Mr. Eddy of Chi
cago alone will be authorized to play
for this country with the official, sanc
tion of the Government." ,On all other
points and details of the appointment
the report is silent. What the Govern
ment expects of an official organist at
Paris, what is to be his official rank,
what he is to play, who is to furnish
the organ and what he is to be paid
are Questions left to such answering
as conjecture may give.
Under such circumstances there
should be sent to Washington a uni
versal petition of the American people
requesting the President, as comman
der in chief of the army, to detail Gen
eral Fitzhugh Lee with a firing squad
to attend Mr. Eddy to Paris and guard
him while there. The reason for such
petition is sufficiently valid, opportune,
important and interesting to be worth
the Sunday attention even of church
going people, and therefore I submit it.
During the war with Spain a great
dignitary of high official rank was for
a time with the corps commanded by
Fitzhugh Lee. He took a superior in
terest in the troops and did a consid
erable amount of supervision while
there. When the time came for him to
go away a regiment was paraded in
his honor and the band ordered to play
a military farewell. Now the boys in
the Spanish war had a great fondness
for "coon" songs and the band chosen
to make music for this particular event
knew them all. As the high dignitary
rode along the line of troops, bowing
and saluting in stately farewell, the
band struck up the ringing, roaring
melody, "We don't care if you never
come back; get a move on you, nlggah,
do."
General Lee was naturally much an
noyed by such a violation of military
decorum on the part of his gallant vol
unteers. All the West Point dignity
within him rose up in wrath and he
swore a great oath with himself that
it shouldn't happen again. In the
course of events Lee was assigned the
duty of relieving the Spanish comman
der in Havana, and taking control in
the name of the United States. An im
posing military ceremony attended the
transfer of the sovereignty of the isl
and' from the one power to the other.
It was arranged that when the Spanish
flag was hauled down the captain gen
eral should at once take his departure,
go aboard a ship and embark for Spain.
The United States was of course to give
him a military salute of honor as he
departed. When Fitzhugh Lee rode
down to the plaza to take part in the
ceremony, he' cast his eye over the
troops drawn up in grand parade and
he saw in the foremost place, with in
struments all prepared, ready to blare
out on the instant, that self-same "coon
song" band that had stirred his bile at
Tampa.
A West Point training, long military
experience and four years of civil war
have taught Lee to act promptly, in
emergencies. He dispatched a staff of
ficer instantly to notify the bandmas
ter that if that ceremony were marred
by a "coon song," or anything like one,
the people of Havana would be enter
tained by seeing a bandmaster shot be
fore sunset. It is scarcely necessary to
say the music of the occasion was par
ticularly stately. It was even solemn.
That is why I say Fitzhugh Lee and
a firing squad should be sent to Pari:,
with Eddy. There should be some mili
tary supervision of American music in
foreign lands.
Â» â¢ â¢
Chicago is of course greatly elated
over the appointment of her Auditor
ium organist to represent the nation
officially as most worthy grand high
master ' of music, or something of that
kind, at the world's great exposition in
the city that most brilliantly illustrates
the civilization of the age; and doubt
less Mr. Eddy feels a thrill of the com
ing gold braid, and is flattered and
proud himself. Nevertheless his lot is
not going to be a happy one. What se
lections to. make when he sets about
the task of rendering American official
music to Europe is a question that may
well give him pause and perplex the
b<aln of him. It is probable even that
when at the supreme moment he rises
to fulfill his duty and to confront his
difficulties and his instrument, he will
wish in his heart he had been born a
tjanjoist and raised in rag time.
It is to be borne in mind that he is
not to be left free to exercise an indi
vidual choice as to what he will play.
The responsibility of officialism will be
upon him. As the Inter Ocean says:
"Whenever Mr. Eddy sits down in front
of the keyboard the audience will feel
that every note which issues from the
pipes is sanctioned by the American
Government." Our Government of
course cannot afford 'to show official
partiality for the music of one nation
over that of another, therefore the per
formance of any -selection from a Eu
ropean source is out of the question.
From .beginning to end Mr. Eddy's
playing must be strictly American in
theme and method. It is easy to fore
see that under such circumstances the
temptation to run Into "coon songs"
will be almost irresistible; and when
It is remembered that thousands of
Americans of the tourist variety will
be among the exposition audiences,
eager to "whoop her up" for every dear
familiar air, it would not be objected
to by true patriots who are not going
to be in Paris, if the President should
equip Lee's firing squad with a Gatling
gun.
* * *
The prevalence of the "coon song" is
indisputable, and because it is preva
lent many people regard it as the pop
ular melody of the country. Some even
assert it to be the music of America as
distinguished from the music of Eu
rope. It is said , we like It because it is
the 'outwelling utterance of our emo
tional life in our own musical vernacu
lar; and as proof of its popularity the
fact cited that within the last few
years over 400 of these songs have been
published and each of them in turn
has found a ready sale. Such an ex
traordinary sale, however, is proof of
anything rather than of popularity. It
is. indeed a convincing evidence that
the American people are so disgusted
with ; such songs that no sooner do they
hear one than* they wish something else
and turn to anything, even to another
"coon song," for a change.
The - true explanation ;of - the toler
ance of such songs in this country is
to be found in what the; cowboy Bald
to the Boston tourist whom he saw
wearing eye glasses: * "What do you c
wear them specks for?" asked the cow
boy. "Because of my misfortune," an
swered the Boston man; "I am near
sighted." The cowboy sized him up
with one glance. "Misfortune, noth
ing."- he said; "it's your derned igno
rance."

We accept the crude, coarse melodies
of the day simply because we are mu
sically ignorant and are sufficiently
lazy to be content with ignorance.
Every immigrant to the United States
brought with him the melodies of his
fatherland. All the sweet songs of the
British islands, of Germany, France,
Italy and Spain are ours by inherit
ance; and we, their descendants, have
traded off that rich store of popular
music for such a mess of pottage as
"coon songs" simply from our ignor
ance of the value of the heritage. We
are musically uneducated and arÂ»
therefore indifferent to musical values,
yet we know good music by instinct
as well as any people on earth.
It is a striking illustration of the un
educated, unformed public sentiment
as regards music in America that while
we tolerate the prevalence of the lowest
form of melody known to civilized man,
yet we willingly pay higher prices for
good music than any other people on
earth. Notwithstanding the immense
subsidies granted by the governments
of the nations of continental Europe
to sustain grand opera and other mu
sical performances, we by popular sup
port alone, unaided by any subsidy,
draw to our concert halls and to our
opera-houses a greater number of great
artists than any other nation.
The New York papers recently pub
lished the official statement submitted
to the stockholders of the Metropoli
tan Opera-house, showing In detail the
receipts and expenditures for the sea
son of the Grau company, and as an
evidence of what a single American
city does to sustain a single opera com
pany for a single season, the figures
are worth considering for as long a
time at any rate as it takes to read
them.
A summary of the salient points of
the statement runs thus: The receipts
were over $800,000, and the profits $150,
--000, of which Grau will receive half, the
other half going to stockholders as an
unexpected dividend. Jean de Reszke
was paid for the season's work $70,000;
Van Dyck, $30,000; Edouard de Reszke,
$28,000; Van Rooy and Plancon, $12,000
each; Saleza, $10,000; Dippel. $8000; Bis
plam, $7500, and Maurel and Albers,
$6000 each. Mme. Sembrieh received
$28,800; Mme. Lehmann, $26,000; Nord
ica, $25,000; Eames, $15,000; Brema, $10,
--000; Mme. Schumann-Heink, $5000; En
gel, Saville and Mantilli, $iOOO each, and
Suzanne Adams, $3500.
It is not within the glittering circles
of wealth alone that good music is val
ued in the United States. Among our
Immigrant population fresh from Eu
rope, and cherishing still the Old World
respect for music, there is to be found
a right appreciation of the true stand
ards of musical accomplishment. Not
long ago I dined at a restaurant pa
tronized mainly by Italian fishermen.
It is not a bohemian place in any re
spect. It is the dining place and lodg
ing-house of hard-working men who
have no time for the delights and the
depravities of bohemia. After their
dinner, while waiting for the tide, the
fishermen began to sing to pass the
time away, and in every instance the.
songs were the arias or the choruses of
the grand operas that have made Ital
ian genius renowned in every land on
earth where there are people capable
of appreciating genius. These fisher
men are not educated men in the ordi
nary sense of the word, at least not in
the American sense of it. They would
not be ranked by Bostonians as "per
sons of culture." Their children will
be full-fledged Americans; they will be
brought up in our public schools; they
will find their amusement in our concert
halls, and If they sing at all they will
make the welkin tinkle like a tin pan
to the tune of "A Hot Time in the Old
Town To-Night."

About nine Americans out of ten have
persuaded themselves they have no ear
for music and could not distinguish
good from evil; and so they never try.
Accepting the assumed physical disa
bility as a fact, they resign themselves
to live in ignorance of the ever flow
ing streams of music around them as
if the ignorance were inevitable and
not to be overcome. That is something
like taking the devil's offspring, indo
lence, baptizing it with the Christian
name, "resignation." and passing it off
as a child of Providence, a dispensa

:. Fortunately for America, fortunately
for the world, the great musicians, de
! spite their natural irritability, have
been as a' rule of unwearying patience
in their effort! to teach an apathetic
multitude of philistines the beauty and
the joy of music. In his recently pub
lished "Fragments of an Autobio
graphy," Felix Moschelles tells a story
of his father which illustrates the true
musician spirit. The elder Moschelles
It appears could never hear a poor
player trying to interpret a masterpiece
without going to his assistance. One
night, while stopping at a little hotel
in Saxony, the family was disturbed
by a pianist banging away in the ad
joining room. Moscheljes says:
Enter my father suavely apologizing
for the interruptionâ we hear it all
through the thin partition. He, too, is
a lover of music; may he as such be
allowed to" listen for- awhile? Much
pleased, the other offers him a chair
and resumes his performance; my
father listens patiently, and waits till
the last bars are reached. "Delightful!"
we hear him say; "a beautiful piece, is
it not? I once learned it, too; may I
try your piano?" And with that he
pounces on the shaky old instrument,
galvanizing it into new life, as he starts
off at a furious rate, and gives vent
to his pent-up feelings in cascades of
octaves and breakneck passages; never
had he played that most brilliant of
pieces more brilliantly. "Good-night,"
he said as he struck the last chord;
"allow me once more to apologize."
"Ach! thus I shall never be able to play
it," answered the neighbor with a deep
sigh, and he closed the piano, and spent
the rest of the evening a sadder but a
quieter man.
* * *
Taking all things into consideration,
it is gratifying to know we are to have
an official organist at Paris, and that
when he is at the keyboard every sound
that comes from the pipes will have the
sanction of our Government. It isn't
often we do that sort of thing, but this
administration is bound to make a
record for harmony.

DOCTORS DIFFER
ON THE RESULT
OF AN AUTOPSY
Subject the Death of
Joseph Cooper.
The doctors disagreed emphatically yes
terday morning as to the cause of the
death of Joseph Cooper, the Powell-street
tailor, who was found dead in bed last
Tuesday morning with the gas turned on.
Dr. Joseph I. Manson, who signed the
death certificate, and who violated a rule
of the Board of Health by neglecting to
Inform the Coroner, repeated his testi
mony of the day before, to the effect that
he had treated the deceased for heart dis
ease for several months, and that "death
was due to degeneration of the muscles
of the heart." What he saw at the au
topsy, made by Dr. Zabala, did not give
him any reason to think otherwise, but i
from what he hnd heard before, during
and after the autopsy, there was some
evidence that there might have been a
gas accident. There was only slight evi
dence of asphyxia, and it was' not a typi- ,
cal case.
Morgue Surgeon Zabala flatly contra
dicted the testimony of Dr. Manson. Dr.
Manson bad testified that he had been a
doctor for about two years. Dr. Zabala
swore that be had been a doctor for fully
two years, and thai he had performed
hundreds of autopsies in New York,
where gas cases and suicides are numer
ous. He was positive that the deceased
had a normal hear. and that death had
been -caused by asphyxiation. The con
dition of the blood showed this. The em
balming fluid had not been injected into
the veins and the blood was natural.
J. 1.. Smith, candy-maker at 136 Powell
street, told* how Cooper had been brood
ing and worrying over the deaths in his
family during the least two years. Cooper
often expressed the wish that he were
dead. He said also that he had gone to
a doctor for what he thought was heart
disease. Spiritualism had been a subject
of conversation between Cooper and the
witness and Cooper had told the witness
that he had "visited mediums and had
conversed with his wife" through them.
The most sensational testimony was
given by John Cahalen of 1146% Mission
street. He had known Cooper for about
fifteen years. Th" deceased told Cahalen
that he did not bcleive there was any
hereafter and that when a man died that
was the end of him. He complained that
his business was getting worse and worse
every day, and that he could not make a
living for himself and his family, and
that it would bo better for the children
â  and himself if he were dead.
"If you contemplate suicide," said Ca
| halen, "I don't think you can get your
j life insurance. It would be better for you
to live your natural life, even if you had
to die in the poorhouse. But Cooper said
, that the courts had decided that it made
! no difference how a person came to his
! deathâ he would get his insurance \
money."
Cooper said also that he was insured
for $6000, and that would be $1000 for each
of his children. But he did not use the
word suicide.

A SUPREME JUSTICE
THE SQUAW'S FRIEND
WHEN he discarded her it was evidently not that s*e was an Indian, but
because she was then an old Indian."
Supreme Court Justice McFarland believes that even an Indian woman
has rights that the paleface must respect and one of these rights re
lates to the sacred bond of matrimony and wifehood, for the foregoing language
was a part of his dissenting opinion in the. case of Lucy Hite against the well
known Mariposa mine-owner, John R. Hite.
The trouble which brings the aged squaw Into the tribunal of Justice of the
white man in the position of plaintiff in a divorce suit dates back over a
quarter of a century- It is a tale of frontier life, poverty, romance and sorrow.
Many years ago Hite was a poor prospector, traveling the rough mountains in
search of the gold that lay hidden in the depths of the then almost unexplored
country. His first "companion was a burro, which served as a* beast of burden
in carrying the camp outfit and provisions.
A young Indian woman, the same who now is casting a cloud over the happi
ness of the miner, met him one day and whether it was a case of love at first
sight or merely a matter of convenience is not known, but they assumed the
relations of husband and wife, Hite overlooking the fact that she was already
the mother of a little halfbreed who went by the name of Thomas H. Gibbs.
The young Indian woman was a welcome addition to the miner's outfit, at least
to the burro, whose burden was made lighter, and together "squawman." squaw
and burro roamed the mountains in search of wealth, which was finally found
in the now valuable Hite mine. V' ;
Then the burro and the Indian woman obtained a respite from their labors and
the former was installed in one of the best houses that could b^e found in the wild
mountains. A quarter of a century passed and, according to witnesses In the pres
ent case, the woman was known all this time as "Mrs. Hite" and "Hite's wife
Lucy." But time made sad inroads upon the beauty of the aborigine and several
years ago Mr. Hite took up a permanent residence among the people of civiliza
tion. A year or so ago while in Oakland he became smitten by the charms of a
young paleface and the two were wedded according to the ceremonies of modern
requirements. Then the trouble began. The Indian woman asserted her rights
by bringing an action for divorce and for her share of the community property.
As might be expected, Hite carried the purse and the dusky and wrinkled
plaintiff discovered that she had to live and the lawyers had to be paid. So
she appealed to the Judge of the Superior Court of this city for alimony and
suit money. Some testimony was taken and the Judge decided that the woman
had claims for consideration and he ordered the mine-owner to pay alimony to
his former companion of the Mariposa Mountains. From this Hite appealed and
the majority of the Justices of the Supreme Court upheld his appeal. Justice
Temple, who wrote the opinion, decided that to justify alimony it must be ad
mitted or proven that there is a marriage. Chief Justice Beatty added: "Only
a wife can claim alimony and when the fact of the marriage is in issue or
unproved there is no one in that position." In this case, so far as it had pro
gressed, the question of the marriage had not been determined.
For all that the majority of the Supreme bench decided in favor of the rich
man, still the poor woman was not without some sympathy, for Justice Mc-
Farland said that the order of the lower court was proper and should be sup
ported. He claimed that the woman was entitled to have aid to prove her case.
Without the means of paying court and legal fees how could she prove that her
suit was a just one? In a sarcastic vein the Justice speaks of Hite, saying:
"Appellant seems deeply impressed with the danger of a well-to-do husband being
compelled to contribute to the prosecution of a scheming woman who swears
falsely that she is his wife; but no fear seems to be entertained that a husband
may prevent an injured wife from obtaining means to prosecute a just suit by
simply averring that she is not his wife."
Justice McFarland stated that .much stress is laid upon the fact that the
woman is only an Indian, but he holds that in matters of justice race cuts no
figure and continued: "When he discarded her it was evidently not that she was
an Indian, but because she was then an old Indian." Justice Garoutte was an
other of the bench who thought that the laws of the State should extend pro
tection to the Indian woman, for, in his opinion, in which he agrees with Jus
tice McFarland, he calls attention to the fact that Hite lived with her for twen
ty-five years; that his sister visited her and slept with her; that Hite had chil
dren by her, and that the nephews and nieces of the mine-owner visited him
and treated the Indian woman as the wife of their uncle. But the majority of
the Supreme bench has decided that money or no money the Indian woman must
prove that she is Hite's wife before she can get any relief. - . _
1 the vessel are going to lay claim to the
salvage themselves. The case is a pecu
liar one, but the underwriters evidently
think that there is something in it, judg
ing by the efforts they put forth to reach
the Thomson and tow her into port.
The vessel and cargo are insured for an
amount in the neighborhood of $100,000.
and the owners of the vessel reason this
way: Supposing a vessel is damaged
while rounding the Horn and the captain
is compelled to put back to Montevideo
for repairs. As soon as she reaches San
Francisco thereafter a general average is
declared and the insurance companies pay
up. Now here is a cargo valued at over
$60,000 saved by the exertions of the cap
tain and crew alone without any outside
help, therefore the claim for salvage will
be made against the underwriters.
When the news of the Thomson being at
Santa Cruz reached the city the under
writers at once chartered the fastest tug
in the bayâ the Fearlessâ sent her
away after the vessel. The owners, how
ever, had got Captain Whitney over the
'phone and told him on no account to ac
cept a tow from the Fearless, but to wait
until Mr. Jerome arrived. Mr. Jerome
then' got aboard the tug Rescue and
started for Santa Cruz. When he arrived
the Fearless had been there over an
hour, but Captain Whitney had refused
Captain Marshall's offers of assistance.
The Rescue then took the Thomson in
tow and brought her to San Francisco.
The underwriters were thus balked in
their attempts to get a hold of the vessel,
and.it now remains to be seen how the
salvage matter will come out.
Several missionaries will go north to
work among the Esquimaux as soon as
the fleet sails for the Arctic. Dr. S. R.
Sprigs and wife will leave on the schoon
er Bonanza about the 23th inst. Dr. Sprigs

be stationed at Point Barrow, where he
â  will act as physician and teacher to the
natives. Charles Brower, who so hero
ically saved the crew of the wrecked
â  whaler Navarch from destruction and
â  nearly lost his own life in an ice floe,
will also be a passenger. He is going to
the Liebes station at Cape Smyth.
The steamer Alice Blanchard was com-
I pelled to return to port yesterday owing
ito a very sad accident. William Bulger
I was formerly a quartermaster on the
'steamer Columbia, but latterly he has
I been sick and unable to work. He was
sufficiently recovered to get back into
: harness last week, so his brother-in-law,
' William Cousins, chief engineer of the
; Alice Blanchard, got him a job aboard
\ that vessel. The steamer -sailed yester
day morning, and while she was passing
out over the bar an iron band fell from
the masthead on Bulger's head,
splitting his skull open in a most
frightful manner. Captain Hall at once
put the Blanchard about and raced back
to San Francisco. On his way up the bay
! he notified the Merchants' Exchange re
i porter and that gentleman .notified the
i Harbor Hospital, so when the Blanchard
! docked at Pacific-street wharf the am
bulance from the hospital was in waiting.
| The injured man was hurried to the hos-
p ital, where Dr. yon der I_eith did every
thing possible for him, but with very lit

BASHFUL WIVES.
Three Japanese Women Believed to
.. Be the Victims of a Slave
Contractor.
The special board of inquiry in United
States Immigration Commissioner North's
offlce are considering the case of three
Japanese women and three Japanese men
claiming to be their husbands, who ar
rived by the last steamer from Japan.
The women are young and pretty, so far
as the Japanese idea of beauty goes, and
so modest that their cheeks burned and
their glances sought the floor bashfully
whenever the handsome Commissioner
looked their way. One of the women tes
tified that she was the wife of one of the
men but that she had not seen him since
their marriage in Japan. The board has
a suspicion arising out of the bad repu
tation of one of the men that the women
are the subjects of a slave contract.

Shorter Hours for Clerks.
The clerks employed in the various
hardware and house-furnishing stores in
the city are taking measures to secure
from their employers shorter working
hours. The working time now commences
at 7 o'clock in the morning and ends at
9 o'clock in the evening. This is consid
ered too long by the men engaged in these
callings, and to remedy the hardship a
petition has been prepared requesting the
proprietors to close at 6 o'clock on all
days except Saturday, on which day the
employes are willing to remain as long as
their employers require them.
There are only six stores In the city
doing business in the lines . mentioned,
four of which are agreeable to the de
mands of their clerks. The minority,
however, are holding out for all day and
a greater portion of the night.

A BOLD CRIME
COMMITTED HEAD
THE CITY HALL
The police are puzzled over a burglary
which occurred Thursday night in the
shadow of the City Hall. Notwithstand
ing that at least a dozen policemen were
in the vicinity at the time, a burglar
broke into Callahan & Hartnet's sa
loon on McAllister street, near Larkln,
and got away with about $10 in silver,
several bottles of whisky and 300 cigars.
After sampling the bottles of liquor that
lined the bar the daring crook wrote a
note in which he said he was sorry for
having been forced to commit the crime,
but promised to "call again" and settle
for the damages.
\ Shortly after midnight Thursday Hart
net, who was on duty at the time, left
the saloon, after securely fastening both
the front and back entrances. When his
partner appeared at 6 o'clock in the morn
ing he was surprised to find the front
door unlocked and the bar littered with
broken bottles. The cash register had
been broken open and the contents were
gone. A broken transom over the rear
door of the saloon showed how the bur
glar had entered.
It is supposed that after Hartnet had
left the place the burglar climbed over a
fence in the rear of the saloon and, pro
curing* a ladder, broke open the tran
som. He then entered the saloon, and,
after breaking open the cash register,
helped himself to the contents. After fill
ing up /with various liquors the bold in
truder picked up a sheet of paper which
he found in one of the sfde rooms and
wrote the missive that was found by one
of the proprietors when he opened the sa
loon on the following day.
The fact that the crime was committed
while a number of policemen were stand
ing in front of the City Hall after having
reported 'off duty makes the burglary
more puzzling.
Both the proprietors of the saloon are
convinced that the burglary was com
mitted by somebody who is familiar with
the premises. They suspect a certain,
man who has been hanging around the
place and who recently declared to a
friend that he intended to rob the saloon.
Since the burglary he has not been seen.
A description of him has been furnished
the police, and every effort will be madO
to apprehend him.

FREE CAMPING.
In Marin, Sonoma, Mendocino and
Lake Counties the Camper finds his natural
home. It may be alongside a quiet stream
in the valley, or by the mountain brook as
it tumbles down the canyon ; perhaps on
the bank of a river, the shore of a lovely
lake, or in the mountain shades under the
towering Redwood.
The spot for an ideal camp is under
shade trees, contiguous to a stream. In
these counties there are, besides a number
of lakes, 300 streams, Russian, Eel and other
rivers, furnishing over 6000 miles of water
length, which are kept well stocked with
trout from the fish hatchery of the Califor-
nia Northwestern Railway, at Ukiah.
Whilst many like to camp out in the
country, far away from the railroad, many
wish to be near their homes, so that father,
son or brother and friends can make fre-
quent visits. For these, attention is called
to the following picturesque spots, which
are especially adapted to campers, and are
of easy access to San Francisco.
On the Sonoma branch of the California
Northwestern Railway is
GLEN ELLEN PARKâ This park contains fifty-five
acres, beautifully shaded. Sonoma, an excellent trout
stream an one of the prettiest creeks in the State, bounds
the park on the north and affords safe bathing. This park
is free to campers, and in addition the country for four
miles along the Sonoma Creek. Mr. C. E. Harvey, agent
California Northwestern Railway Co. at Glen Ellen, will
show locations.
y^y.y
MIRABEL PARK is on our Guerneville brar:h, twelve
miles from Santa Rosa. The train stops at the park, and
Mr. Ogburn, the party in charge, will be on hand to receive
and locate campers. Mark West Creek skirts the park and
is dammed, affording fine bathing, fishing and boating.
Boats for hire at reasonable rental.
GUERNEVILLE, in the midst of the redwood country,
and on the Russian River, is practically the terminus of the
Guerneville branch. The people of the town and vicinity un-
der the name of the Business Men's Association of Guer-
neville offer free camping sites throughout the whole sec-
tion. The Russian River will be dammed, affording a
magnificent sheet of water for bathing and. boating. Mr.
D. Connell, proprietor of the livery stable at Guerneville!
representing the association," will meet all trains and with-
out charge will show prospective campers the various lo-
cations.

California Grand Lodge of the
Order to Meet.
Till-: Grand Lodge of California of
the Knights of Pythias and the
Grand Temple of the Rathboi Sis
ters, the latter being the auxiliary
of the Knights, will be in session
in the city of Santa Cruz this week, com
mencing to-morrow.
This order, which is of American origin,
is a secret benevolent one that was estab
lished in Washington"; D. C, January 19,
WA, by Justus Henry Rathbone for the
dissemination of the principles of friend
ship, charity and benevolence. In it what
in other orders are called degrees are
termed "ranks." Of these there are three
âpage, esquire and knight all busi
ness is transacted in the rank of knight.
Since the institution of '.he order two
ranks have been added for work outside
of the lines originally laid down b> the
institutor. One is the Uniform Rank and
the other the Endowment Rank. The for
mer la a semi-military branch, and the

plain the details of the victory.
:
ADMISSION, 800. CHILDREN. 25c.
members, who have adopted an attractive
uniform, are drilled in the tactics of the
United States infantry, and are all by the
obligation taken pledged to support the
National Government in time of war and
maintain the honor of the American flag.
A number of- years ago the services of the
membership was offered to the War De
partment, with the understanding that
everj- one able to enter the military serv
ice stood ready to respond to a call to
i arms. It stands as a sort of reserve to
the army, its tender having been accept
ed. During the late war the Knights
were not called upon as a body, but many
from all parts of the Union, true to their
Obligation, volunteered in the service of
the country. The Endowment Rank is the
mutual insurance branch of the order.
The first quarterly statement of the board
of control of this rank shows that on the
last day of last March this rank had
55.459 members, who are protected for the
benefit of their families in the sum of
$101,546,000. Since the institution of this
rank there has been paid to beneficiaries
$13,320,776.
The headquarters of the Supreme Lodge
of the order is in Nashville, Term.. and
has for head chancellor J. C. Ross of Sa
vannah, Ga., and for supreme keeper of
records and seal C. D. Robinson of St.
Louis, Mo. There are lodges in almost
every State and Territory of the Union,
and lodges in British Columbia, Mani
toba, Ontario, the Hawaiian Islands,
Mexico and the Province of Quebec. The
total membership is 465,000.
In California the order has a member
ship of about 12,000. being an increase of
nearly 250 during the past year. Two
new lodges were instituted and two sur
rendered their charters, so that numer
ically the number of lodges Is the same as
it was at the previous session. There has
been a material increase in the funds,
and despite the fact that the sum of $65,
--000 was expended for the relief of mem
bers there was an Increase ln funds of
nearly $7000. .-" ; .;Â«Â£j
The order of Rathbone Sisters, as it is
now called, was instituted by J. A. Hill,
the founder, by the organization of the
first temple at Warsaw, Ind., October 23,
ISB9. The first grand temple was institut
ed the next year in the same State. At
that time the members were known as
the Pythian Sisters, and worked under
that appellation until 1*94, when the Su
preme Lodge of the Knl**.ts Issued an
edict which caused the Sisters to adopt
the name of Rathbone in place of Pyth
ian. Any member of the Knights in good
standing can become a member of a
temple of the Rathbone Sisters.
One year after the institution of the
first temple in the United States Mrs. C.
L. C. Lawrance, S. M. of R. and C, was
in this State on her way to Los Angeles
to Institute a temple there when she was
intercepted at Sacramento and was in
duced to make the start in that city, on
the ground that it was the Capital of the
State. California Temple No. 1 was in
stituted there with 23 members. Since
then the order has grown in this State to
forty-three temples with about 1200 sisters
and about 1300 knights. During the past
year there has been an increase of nine
temples, with loss of only one, and since
the close of the reports, on the last day
of December, one temple was instituted
with 94 members.
The names of the grand officers of the
Grand Lodge and those of the Grand
Temple have already been published in
The Call.

HAD A ROW WITH
A COLORED MAN
MRS. J. C. FRANKLIN, ACTRESS,
ARRESTED AND DISCHARGED,
Contradictory Stories Told by Her
and Joseph Johnson When Ex
amined by Judge Mogan.
A well-dressed woman, who gave the j
name of Mrs. J. C. Franklin, and a sporty !
looking colored man named Joseph John
son were arrested about 4 o'clock yester- |
day morning at Sixth and Jessie streets
by Policeman Callahan on a charge of |
disturbing the peace
They appeared before Judge Mogan yes
terday, and the woman, in answer to the
Judge, said she had been visiting friends
on Sacramento street and stayed later
than she expected. While going to a
friend's house on Harrison street she met
the colored man, and as his family were
on her father's plantation in the South
she stopped to speak to him. They were
talking in a loud tone when the officer ar
rested them. The Judge admonished her
to keep better hours and allowed her
to go.
Johnson was then called upon, but he
denied ever having seen the woman be
fore. He said he met her on the street
and they quarreled about nothing In par
ticular. He was also admonished and dis
charged.
The woman admitted that her real name
was Thome, that she was at one time
an actress and was related to Charles M.
Thorpe, the well known actor. She was
living at the Baldwin Hotel at the time
of the tire and was rescued by Policeman
Sylvester. She had a large quantity of
jewelry in her room at the Baldwin. She
is separated from her husband, who is
in the East.
WILSON'S STRAW BONDS.
Attorney J. N. E. Wilson Wants the
Negro Arrested on a Charge
of Perjury.
The article in yesterday. Call as to the
probability of the Grand Jury indicting
Attorney J. N. E. Wilson and Clerk Kelly
of Judge Graham's court in connection
with the straw bond accepted by Kelly
for the release of Harry Wilson, the
negro, had the effect of making Attorney
Wilson appear before Judge Mogan yes
terday with a complaint charging the
negro with perjury committed before the
Grand Jury.
In the complaint it was alleged that the
attorney did not advise the negro to leave
the city, but instructed him to be in court
and stand his trial. The other allega
tions of the negro as to giving the attor
ney $300 and going with him to a room on
Fourth street, where the money was. paid
by a woman friend of the negro, are de
nied. .' â¢ . ; .*.:"-> :'.:â¢â *
Judge Mogan refused to sign the war
rant, as he had no desire to interfere with
the work of the Grand Jury, but Wilson
was persistent, and the Judge said he
would think over the matter till to-mor
row.
The police are determined to take all
the men on bonds accepted by- Clerk
Kelly in misdemeanor cases before the
Grand Jury, as there is a belief that many
of them are in the same position as Riley
and Cosgrove, who were on the negro's
bonds.

WYOMING DOWNED DAISY F IN
THE HANDICAP.
(Queen Nubia at Odds of 12 to 1 Ran

Standstill Choioes
First.
A light Saturday crowd attended the
races at Oakland. The card offered was a
very shabby one, not worthy of the pat
ronage bestowed. The feature of the rac
ing was the riding of Jack "Ward, who
piloted four winners over the line. Three
purses were take*:; down by favorites.
The capture of the mile handicap, the
closing chapter, by Wyoming, was the
most unexpected of the afternoon. The
ring laid 10 and 12 to 1 against the son of
Pardee, simply because Tullett had the
mount. After Rosormonde and San Yen
ado had raced out in front to the stretch
Tulleti took his mount up, and quickly
assuming the first position, downed the
favorite Daisy F half a length. The lat
ter was slow to break from the barrier
or she would undoubtedly have scored.
A mile selling run, which opened pro
ceedings, furnished a surprise. Queen
Nubia, which has not faced the barrier

New Rupture Cure.
Remarkable Discovery by Dr. Rice That

A Home Cure Sold at a Low Price and Is
Restoring Thousands "Who Wore

What If known as the Rice plan of curing

cesses. It is a combined treatment, which not
only perfectly ports a rupture so that it
cannot possibly come out, but at the same time
MRS. DR. JOHN BELL.
induces a rapid healing of the abdominal
muse!-- nnd makes the cure complete and per-
manent. ' â -"Â»'-
Tho wife of a well-known physician at Steu-
bonvlllo, 0.. Mrs. Dr. John Bell, is a recent ex-
ample of the wonderfully practical results of
the Rle-e method. This well-known lady was
perfectly cured in one month if a rupture which
ehe had bein troubled with for eight years.
Although in mieldle_ life and somewhat skeptical
of other than the usual doctor's remedy, an
operation, she tried the new plan of Dr. Rice
and was cured in me short month.
There ia absolutc-ly no pain or danger, no
operation nor detention from work and Is a
wonderful improvement over the old methods
of trying to cure rupture with painful and dan-
gerous trusses. All who are ruptured should
at once write to Dr. W. S. Rice, 41-* V Main
street, Adams, N. V., for his free Illustrated
book fully describing Ms Invention and clearly
and convincingly showing that his method
absolutely ano permanently cures any rup-
ture, even the bad e;_ses. He has cured hun-
<lreels of old people, 7u to &3 years of age, who
had been ruptured all their lives. If you know
of ar.v person who is ruptured write to Dr. W.
P. Rice and have a book pi_nt to the sufferer.
Fue-h an.a?t of kindness will be gratefully re-
membered by any one who is struggling through

in many moons, was entirely overlooked. |
Her odds in the betting went back from
4 to 12, and she disposed of Kootenai
without half trying. Mercelles, the favor
ite, was never a factor.
The Corrigan outfit did not seem to
fancy the chances of Potente, putting
their checks down on Malay, and the
paddock crowd followed suit. The conse
quences were that the brown gelding
went to the post a3to 5 choice. Lime
water made all the running, but at the
wire was easily subdued by the favorite,
which won by four lengths in 1:18. Po
tente, evidently out of tune, finished
third.
Tim ruled favorite for the mile and a
half seling run, and with Jack Ward on
his back led Benamela past the judges
over a length at the end. Ward managed
to get in numerous pockets during the
progress of the running, finally playing
in luck by getting through next the rail
entering the stretch. Major Hooker ran
a shifty third.
In the mile seling affair, fourth to be
i decided, Nilgar, which was a "lobster" In
â¢â  a race earlier in the week, came to life,
1 beating a cheap bunch of platers. Ward,
i who had the mount, took the lead on the
'â¢ back stretch and was never headed. M"l
--karth finished second, five lengths ahead
iof Judge Wofford. The lukewarm choice,
P. A. Finnegan, never looked dangerous.
Another mile selling run followed, re
sulting in" a handy win for the favorite
Fortis. Earl Cochran finished strong,
leading Grady for the place.

A TREASURED COLLECTION
OF SMOKERS' ARTICLES
GATHERED BY MAJOR YON
GIEGLINGER OF THIS CITY.
All Sorts of Curious and Antique
Pipes Which Have Been Found
About the World.
One of the most interesting collections
of curio pipes and smokers* material on
the Pacific Coast has been. placed on ex
hibition in" the jewelry department of W.
K. Vandersllce & Co., 136 Sutter street, in
this city. It is the property of Major Ar
thur yon Gieglinger and contains rare
specimens j of ' smokers' articles. - The col
lection is valued at several thousand dol
lars, placing it at its lowest figure, but
its real market price is not given, as the
purchase price only is marked on each
article, and no duty or cost of transpor
tation is. included. - /
About twenty years ago' Major yon
Gieglinger j conceived the idea of gather
ing the choicest smokers' articles which
could be found on two continents. Dur
ing his travels he searched the most se
cluded parts of the globe in quest of
selections for his collection and after
each journey brought home treasures in
the shape of curios. The major was large
ly acquainted and many of his friends
went abroad year after year. His parting
request to. all of them was to continue the
search ho had begun and to secure pipes
of ancient date or romantic history with-,
out regard to cost. Invariably they re
turned with something which found a
ready position in the major's cabinet.
The first" piece, which probably laid the
foundation to the collection, is a briar
pipe carved by Major yon Gieglinger with
a pocket knife while . a prisoner of war
in Llbby Prison. During the long hours
of confinement In this notorious peniren
tlary the little bowl and stem cut by his
own hands out of briar wood became his
only solace. Closely associated with .this
pipe "in romance .is a forester's pipe,
once the property of General Souvaroff, a
Russian "officer of St. Petersburg, who
was banished to Siberia in 1848, but who
escaped in 1859. During his Incarceration
the pipe was 1 the unfortunate officer's only
companion' and it was obtained for the
collection after his death, several years
later.. In the cabinet it is numbered 27.
The remainder of the assortment com
prises pipes of almost every â¢ description.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, STJNDAT, MAT 14, 1899.
Meerschaums of all varieties; Vienna,
Arabian, Hamburg, Uhlmer and Hunga
rian have been carefully classified. A
wood bowl carved from the black forests
in Bohemia attracts much attention, and
a beautiful London pocket pipe with
mouthpiece of rare amber and mounted
with silver is a work of art. All the East
Indian utensils are Included and some of
them are curious in shape and design.
Chinese and Japanese pipes are worth
Inspection and the Indian pipes have bern
collected from almost every known tribe
of Indians.
In addition to pipes there are many curi
ous cigar-holders and tobacco-boxes. The
display has attracted many curio collect
ors to the place and the articles have been
pronounced rare and genuine by all who
have seen them.
Circus Coming to Town.
Elaborate preparations are being
made at Glen Park for a circus. Bare
back trick riding will be made a fea
ture of this new attraction at the popu
lar resort. During the past week two
emus have been added to the zoological
collection at the park. They came up
on the Moana from Queensland, Aus
tralia. To-day's performance at Glen
Park will consist of the following num
bers: Balloon ascension and parachute
jump, prize competitions for children,
a grand concert and flne vaudeville
programme.
The Elevator Accident.
The Coroner's jury In the inquest yes
terday morning upon the body of James
Alliato. who was crushed to death in the
sidewalk elevator of the Remington Arms
Company, returned a verdict of accident
al death due to the carelessness of the
deceased. The jury added the following
clause:
We recommend to the Board of Supervisors
that an ordinance be passed obliging all owners
of elevators to build arches on elevators,
thereby raising the covers at the rising of the
elevators. -â¢'.;'

All of the properties are valuable. The machinery and equipment are modern
nnd of a high degree of efficiency. The properties are free of all debts and In- j
cumbrances and the new corporation starts with ample working capital.
The product is a staple necessity. The Industry Is an Important and growing
one and Is not affected by the tariff or financial disturbances.
The management, as can readily be seen, Is strong, experienced, capable
and conservative. ' â¢
A thorough examination of these properties has been made by Mr. Robert
Bha'W of Chicago, who has been for many years In the Biscuit Business, who
certifies that they are valuable and well adapted to the business. An expert
accountant gaged by the organizers of the new corporation certifies, after a
thorough examination of the accounts for a period of years, that the earnings of
the various companies operated separately have made for a number of years
past, in spite of the severe ccfrnpetitlon which has existed among them, a net
average annual profit of $205,000 per annum and that a conservative estimate of
the timings of the company after consolidation would be in excess of $100,000
without raising the price of standard goods to the consumer.
. The PREFERRED STOCK of $100 per share is cumulative, and dividends of
V per cent are payable semi-annually. It has full voting-power and together with
the common stock is registered and is Issued full paid ion-assessable, carrying

DIVINE HEALING.
THE GIFT
OF DIVINE
HEAEING,
Daily Exercised in a Wonder-
; Inl Way by Healer Fran-
cis Truth.
Despite Envious Criticism His Humani-
tarian .Work Goes On With
Excellent Results.
TESTIMONIALS FROM PATIENTS
Those Who Have Been Cured at His Hands
Include People in Every Walk
of Lifeâ Remarkable
Cases.
The success attending the efforts of
Healer Francis Truth at 440 Geary
street in the cause of good health and
the alleviation of suffering is becom-
ing more pronounced as the days pass.
The fact that Healer Truth and his
corps of assistants are kept busy from
morning to night has aroused the at-
tention of medical men to his remark-
able cures, with the result that his
work is dally discussed by profes-
sionals. It is a peculiar fact that
among Healer Truth's patients at the
present time are 'the wives of. two
prominent physicians of this city. Both
are receiving benefits which they
deemed impossible until curiosity
prompted them to desert materia med-
ica for the system of divine healing as
exemplified by Healer Truth.
The cures being accomplished by
Healer Truth, both present and absent,
are increasing in number daily. Thou-
sands of letters are received each week
from every part of the world asking
for information as to the methods of
treatment, and demanding treatment.
These letters are on file In Mr. Truth's
offices and may be seen by any one
who doubts their genuineness.
In quoting from these letters, as illus-
trating the excellent results following
Healer Truth's treatments, only the Ini-
tials of the writers and the names of
the cities in which they live are used.
This is done in response to the requests
of the writers themselves, a plea which
Healer Truth Invariably respects.
E. A. R. of Ukiah writes under date
of April 25: "Praise the Lord; I am
almost well again! My feet and limbs
were like puff balls, but the swelling
is all gone now, and I can walk around.
I will send you other patients from
here."
Mrs. T. S. M. of Healdsburg, after
several treatments, writes the Healer
that '"her limbs do not pain her, and
except for a lameness in her feet she
is doing remarkably well." She an-
nounces that her condition shows re-
markabje Improvement.
Mrs. A. S. H. of Morgan Hill, Minn.,
states in a letter that before beginning
| with Healer Truth's treatments she
! was forced to live on malted milk. The
j day after the first treatment she could
eat anything her appetite craved for,
and she is now rapidly regaining her
lost health and flesh. Mrs. H. is the
wife of a well-known merchant of Mor-
gan Hill.
A. G. R., a well-known mining man
of Lompoc, Cal., who suffered for years
excruciatingly, writes that under
Healer Truth's absent treatment he is
improving wonderfully. "I consider
j that you are doing me a world of good,"
j he writes, "and I am glad of it. Let the
good work go on."
Mrs. C. C. of Collegevllle, San Joa-
I quin County, Cal., who is a sufferer
from cancer, began treatments with
Healer Truth last month. Under date
of May 7 she writes: "The cancer on
my arm is much better. It looked at
first as If it was going to break, but
it is now going away. The pains are
dying away. I think I will be fully
cured in a short time."
Mrs. Charles Solens of Sacramento,
! who suffered partial blindness some
years ago through an attack of fever,
was completely cured after three ab-
| sent treatments. She writes: "I could
not recognize my husband seated on
j the other side of the table from me
! a month ago, but now I can read the
j newspapers at arm's length. This is
! the result of your treatments, â¢"..id I am
i not ashamed to let the whole world
know it. How you accomplished my
i cure I know not, but now that you
j did it, I am the happiest woman In the
State."
F. R. S., a well-known young woman
living at Eureka, suffering from a de-
bilitating female complaint, writes that
her condition shows marked improve-
ment after two treatments. So changed
is her condition, she says, that her
friends have remarked It, and although
not yet cured, she is receiving the con-
gratulations of her friends at the rosy
promise the future holds out to her.
C. A. L.. wife of an attorney at Santa
Cruz, while on a visit recently to San
Francisco, called on Healer Truth and
arranged for treating a daughter af-
flicted with inflammatory rheumatism.
The case was an unusually severe one,
and presented tremendous difficulties of
a physical character. The young wo-
man never left her home, while under-
going treatment, but after three weeks
her affliction gradually disappeared,
leaving no trace behind. She is now,
after a lapse of six weeks, absolutely
and permanently cured.
Numerous cases of the kind referred
to might be mentioned. During the
past week hundreds of cures were ef-
fected in this city, some of which were
of a startling character. Among the
Healer's patients at the present time
are some of the best-known people of
the city. Some of these were skeptics
at first, but now they realize that di-
vine healing is not an acquired art, but
a gift of wonderful power. This power
will be exercised in the cause of suf-
fering humanity by Healer. Truth, de-
spite the criticisms of those who look
upon his increasing practice with
dread. " . â  â  - â â¢'â -â

bottom notch now. If you will look at the
i lots we are offering south of

Inability to Hit at the Proper Time
and Several Life-Sized Bungles
Besponsible for Their
Defeat.
Ex-Senator K. Peeples, resplendent In
an Oakland uniform, played a conspicu
ous part in the defeat of the Watsonville
aggregation in a nerve-racking contest at
Recreation Park .yesterday* afternoon.
Last evening the retired statesman and
new dude was formally presented with
the keys to the Athenian municipality,
the City Hall and several well-kept
parks, which he accepted with becoming
dignity. yyy-
The team was full of ginger, played an
most flawless game, and batted hard and
timely. The yawning chasm at second
had been filled up by the substitution
of Peeples for Dee Hammond, and
the whole team felt more confident. Kid
covered his new position as well as he
formerly played the left corner, and prac
tically won the game in the first inning
by sending In two men with a double to
the left field fence. Jack Donovan
shared the honors with Peeples.
Watsonville was first up and scored on
Moskiman's error of Brockhoff's hard
drive, which let him to second. McCar
thy's out advanced him to third and
Courtney's single put him over the slab.
Oakland made three runs at the outset.
Donovan led off. with a single, but was
caught at second. Schmeer hit to short
and made two pegs on McCarthy's high
throw to first. Lange hit an Infield sin
gle and stole second. Hammond followed
with a drive to left, scoring Schmeer, and
Peeples sent both Lange and Hammond
home with his double. Moskiman hit a
liner into McCarthy's mitt and the "Kid"
was doubled up. -With two out in the sec
ond Shea, for Oakland, reached first on
McCarthy's fumble and tallied on Dono
van's triple. Another run was gathered
in by the Dudes in the third, McCarthy's
third error giving Hammond his life. Pee
ples sacrificed him to second and Court
ney's muff of Moskiman's long fly let him
home.
Watsonville bunched hits in the fourth
and scored two credits. With Selna on
first Plake hit to Peeples, who fielded the
Indian out at second. Plake stole sec
ond and tallied on Morrow's single, the
batter going to second on the throw in,
and Hayes' single putting him over the
plate.
Oakland's last two runs came in the
, seventh, a base on balls, two steals, a sac
rifice and a brace of singles letting
Schmeer and Hammond make the circuit.
Watsonville also picked up a pair in the
eighth. Brockhoff was given a pass and
got around. on McCarthy's triple, the lat
ter scoring on Selna's single. The score:

was defeated this afternoon by the Beach
combers by a score of 9 to 3. Their de
feat was due to the heavy slugging of the
locals and their own costly errors.
Donlin did not pitch his usual game,
giving ten men bases on balls, and hit
ting four San Francicans. Santa Cruz
had two new men, Ed Smith and J. Dren
nan, in the team. Donlin and Streib each
made three-baggers. In the fifth inning
some heavy stick work was done by San

San Jose Defeats Sacramnto.
SAN JOSE, May 13.â game between
the Sacramento and San JOse teams to
day was won by the locals by a score of
sto 3. It was marked by some sensa
tional features. Doyle, for the Senators,
insisted on playing Truck Eagan at third
base, in spite of the league's decision that
he belongs to San Jose, and over the pro
test of Manager Gilbert of this city. Rube
Levy, the umpire, gave a run to San Jose
on a ball that had rolled in the weeds
and got lost, and Doyle's protest was so
loud and vigorous that he was fined $5.
Some time was lost in jawvworking over
this matter. The pitchers, Harvey and
Andrews, did good work, but there was
considerable fumbling, and at times a
lamentable lack of ginger. The score:

MEDICOS DEFEAT THE IOWAS.
Sailors Played Well but Showed They
Had Had Very Little Practice.
The baseball contest between the sailors
of the lowa and a nine from the College
of Physicians and Surgeons was settled
as per schedule yeseterday afternoon. At
half-past 2 every Jackie who could be
come possessed of 10 cents carfare hied
himself to the grounds at Sixteenth and
Folsom streets provided with a nine-fath
om yell and a heart full of hope for the
sailor boys who were to appear on the
diamond. "Billy," the goat, made his ap
pearance- early in the- game, sober and
dignified.- . _ . â¢..'â¢;:':;._..'..'â¢"-.
' The jackies arrayed their forces at one
end of the grand stand, and the austere
looking professors along with a I contin
gent of youthful medicos, sporting gaudy
streamers of ribbons on dude canes, took
up a position opposite. Each of the fac
tions tried to vanquish the other by pro
longed shouting during the progress of
the game. Charles Neil was umpire.
The boys of the lowa became discour
aged after the first five innings. The
score stood IS to 5 against them, but they
partially consoled themselves with the
thought that their men had the advan
tage of but one. week's practice, while
their opponents were old war horses on
the field. The sixth inning however, was
different. Seven runs were- made by the
sailors, and everything livened up. The
boys of the battle-ship crowded into front
seats and shouted until the college men
felt sick. The rest of the story is that at
the end of the game the score stood 29
to IS in favor of the physicians. Geiger,
the lowa's pitcher, was out of practice
and weakened toward the latter end of
the game. The sailors played well and
did some good batting. Lyons, the catch
er, was in good form and held out well.
Pratt pitched for the college boys and
Deacon was behind e\Â»e bat. The pro
ceeds of the affair will go to the X. S.

for the members of the First California
Regiment.

Mrs. Wagner is in an extremely criti
cal condition owing to the shock ex
perienced when she was made aware of
the fearful end of her two boys' careers.
Several physicians have been called to
attend her, but it is feared that her days
are numbered.
All information coming from Utah is
kept from the unhappy mother, and al
though she is always demanding to know
what is going on, her demands are only
partlally complied with. Her entire right
--ide is almost paralyzed, and even should
she recover she will be wrecked physi
cally, and it is feared that she will never
regain her reason, which is at this time
shattered.
Mrs. Wagner is now being supported
partly by the Supervisors and partly by
the elder of her two boys by her second
husband.
For years airs. Wagner has not been
strong .tally, and after Abe's, return
from Fe'lS. 11l til-.- disappointment she ex
perienced caused .her to relinquish all
hope for he future, and after becoming
possessed of this Idea none of her friends

The fact that her son Abe was yester
day convicted of murder with the death
penalty will not be told Mrs. Wagner

never. :*:â -â¢* -..

on the upper campus. Between two and
three thousand visitors made -the scene
impressive A large stage had been erect

The publication caused the tongues of
gossips to wag and is perhaps largely.re
sponsible for the â¢ bringing of the suit,
since it is referred .to in - the ; complaint
as a feature of the cruelty, Mrs. - Laing
alleging that she had to leave 1 the home.
It Is understood that the name of a
sister of Mrs. Laing is mentioned under
very compromising circumstances in the
complaint, it being stated that the hus
band was guilty of "improper relations"
with her. The name of Mme. Jacques,
who has been wanted by the- local author-
Hies for murder, is also said to be men

by the bazaar, which was held in conjunc

ALBERT HORRIGER RETURNS
TO FACE HIS ACCUSERS
L. A. SOUC'S LATE PARTNER NOT
AN ABSCONDER.
Albert Horriger, who was reported to
have absconded with $5000 belonging to ,
the late real estate firm of L. A.' Souc &
Co., of which he was a member, is back
in the city with blood in his eye. Mr.
Horriger not only denies that he took any
money belonging to the firm when he sud
denly departed on the 18th of last month,
but declares that Souc knew he did not.
Mr. Horriger arrived in San Francisco
on the overland train Friday night, com
ing direct from Columbus, Ohio.
"Mr. Souc's statement that he did not
know the firm was involved when I left
the city is false." said Mr. Horriger yes
terday. "He knew it long before, and the
night before I left the city I told him
we must raise a couple of "thousand dol
lars at once to tide us over the crisis.
I urged him to apply to his relatives for
j a loan, and said I would also try to raise
some money among my friends. I had a 1
very good friend near Spanishtown, from i
whom I hoped to be able to borrow some
money, and when I left the office next
day I told my clerk, Mr. Wallace, I was
going to Spanishtown and that if I did
not succeed In' getting any money there
I would go farther, I failed to make the
loan and decided to go East and try to
raise the money in Columbus, my old
home. I was delayed in Chicago four
days by illness and knew nothing of the
report 'that I was an absconder until the
day after my arrival in Columbus. I im
mediately started back to San Francisco '
to face my accusers.
"I am well aware that our affairs are |
In bad shape, and have been for two j
years. We were taking Peter's money to
pay Paul, but business was picking up,
and we would have been all right in time.
It is true we were between $4000 and $5000
short, but where the money went I can
not tell for the life of me. Souc could tell
a great deal more about that if he wanted 1
to. I borrowed $500 on my personal note
last March to help the. firm out, and that
money I shall have to repay. I was in [
business with Souc four years, and I did I
not draw $200 in any one year. I paid my i
board and other personal expenses out of
money I had laid away, and now I haven't
a dollar. Ido not know how much Souc
drew, but he had nothing when we began
business, and he has not stinted himself
since. I am willing to shoulder my share
of the blame for the tangle in our af
fairs, but I do not propose to be made a
scapegoat for any one else, and I want* to
be straight before the public."

WANT TO ORGANIZE
A BIG LABOR TRUST
AMBITIOUS SCHEME OF THE CO
OPERATIVE BROTHERHOOD.
In these days of trusts, when every In
dustry is watched closely by financiers
and promoters, it is difficult to find a field
they have not entered. " Such a field has
been found, however. It Is nothing more
nor less than a labor trust. .Some men,
viewing the rapid strides made in recent
years in the introduction of labor-saving
machinery, have arrived at the conclusion
that in another five years the present
army of unemployed, estimated at 5,000,000
people, will have increased many fold.
Everything will be done by machinery
and there will be no call for men, they
claim.
The continuation of the system of ma
chine production is held to mean the con
tinued existence of monopoly in some
form. The man who has only labor to
Bell is at a greater disadvantage than at
any time since the world began. To coun
teract this tendency of the times, it is
proposed to form a big labor organization
to oppose the industrial organization of
the capitalists. The desire is said to be
to recover the tools of industry and use
them to control economic conditions.
The Co-operative Brotherhood was or
ganized in Seattle a year ago and has a
thriving colony or settlement twenty
miles from that city. James S. Ingalls
is president and national organizer. He
is at present in this city, and addressed
a largely attended meeting in Pythian
Castle last night. It is the intention to
organize a temple, as the lodges are des
ignated, and Mr. Ingalls promises to have
a California colony within a year. The
objects of the lodge are given as follows:
To organize persons for the co-op
erative production of wealth; to se
cure the equitable distribution thereof
among those producing it, thereby
dispensing with the wage system; to
provide for the collective ownership
of the means of production and dlstrl- ,
button, and to make it possible for
those so organized to recognize in a
practical way the brotherhood of hu
manity. -..**-â¢
It is intended to have a public meeting
shortly at Metropolitan Temple, when the
workings of the brotherhood will be out
lined. * . ..-'-â

TOWED INTO EUREKA IN DIS

She Was Built for a Patrol Boat on
the Yukon River, but Will
Probably Never Reach
St. Michael.
The wiseacres along the front were all
shaking their heads and saying, "I told
you so," yesterday. They were referring
to the steamer Nunivak, now at Eureka.
Reports from Humboldt Bay say she will
never go to sea again, unless it may be
that during a flne spell of weather she
should be towed back to San Francisco
to be broken up for junk.
The Nunivak proved to be a good vessel
on her trial trip on the bay and was ac
cepted by the United States authorities.
On May 2 she was taken in tow by the
revenue cutter Richard Rush and a start
was made for the Yukon. Lieutenant
Commander Thompson was in command
of the Rush and Lieutenant Cantwell in
command of the Nunivak. Almost as soon
as the two revenue cutters passed the
lightship a storm came up from the
northwest and the troubles of the Nuni
vak began. The seas made clean breaches
over her and the creaking and groaning
of her timbers made her crew fear she
would go to pieces.
The third day out . the Nunivak was
leaking like a sieve and the crew pre
pared to abandon her at any moment.
The hogchains snapped one after another,
the calking dropped out of the seams and
the water poured in not only through the
sides but down through the decks: her
deckhouse was shifted eight Inches and
the engines and boilers were forced ten
Inches out of line, and, to add to the
misery and despair of the crew, the
pumps choked.
It now looked as though the Nunivak
would drop to pieces at any minute and
Lieutenant Cantwell signaled the Rush
that he would have to abandon his vessel.
Captain Thompson signaled back asking
him to stand by her a little longer, as he
thought he could make Eureka. Luckily
for the Nunivak, the wind began to die
out about this time and Humboldt bar
was crossed in safety.

GAGE AND McLAUGHLIN
ON THE VERGE OF WAR
Governor Unwilling to Send
Samuel Rucker to Paris.
In Filling State Offices the Chief Executive
Ignores Petitionsâ Advice of Leading
Citizens Disregarded.
HUNDREDS of applicants for of
ficial positions under the pres
ent State administration will
be surprised and shocked to
learn that their petitions have
not been read and their recommenda
tions not considered.
The Call is in possession of informa
tion that petitions and applications. In
dorsed and supported by leading Re
publicans bf the State, have not se
cured the scant consideration of a read
ing by Governor Gage.
At the conference which took place
at the Palace Hotel last week, in which
Governor Gage and several men called
in to represent the Republican party
participated, nanus of applicants were
considered: but the petitions and rec
ommendations respecting the various
applications were not at hand, tl was
said then that the written indorsements
were on file in the executive office, Sac
ramento, and would he examined later
The Governor announced that he in
vited the judgment of leading Repub
licans to guide him in making selec
tions in order to strengthen the party
in the next campaign. He was advised
that the interests urging an appoint
ment should be considered, if the pur
pose in view was to promote harmony
in the party. He paid little attention
to the suggestion, but went along with
the consideration of names in a loose
and rambling fashion.
The system was not changed when
he reached Sacramento. D. M. Burns,
Grove Johnson. C M Shortridge, Major
McLaughlin, Jim Rea and others were
called in to tell what they knew of the
applicants. As a result of the Gover
nor's system, or lack of* system. Repub
licans representing the highest grades
of citizenship and the leading indus
trial interests of the commonwealth
have been wholly ignored. Th- peti
tions which they signed and the recom
mendations which they submitted have
had no consideration. Reputable Re
publicans, for whose ability and in
tegrity they vouched, were "turned
down" without the pretense of a hear
ing.
The break between the Governor and
Major McLaughlin may come any hour.
The major's heart is set on the ap
pointment of Sam Rucker as a Com
missioner to the Paris Exposition. He
is also backing Jacob Steppacher for
Registrar of Voters, hut is not insist
ing on the latter appointment as a per
sonal favor. He insists, however, that
Rucker should be named for Commis
sioner if everything else sought is de
nied. ''age is said tee be ready to ap
point Jake, but will not appoint Ruc
ker.
When advised that the major would
declare war if Rucker was turned
down, Sage plied :
"I am willing to have one more fight.
If the- major wants war he can have it.
1 am ready to appoint Steppacher, but
I cannot appoint Rucker."
The fact is known to leading politi
cians of both parties that the Governor
tendered to E. B. Pond the appointment

Sleep after First Application.
Cured in Eight Weeks.

that it would remain a running sore on account
of tho poisonous state of my blood." When I
' got out of bed I could hardly stand the pain, and
bad to get along with a crutch. I tried all kinds
of blood and other medicines without success, my
leg getting worse until It became a solid sora
from my knee to instep. Utterly discouraged
and almost wild wtth pain, I gave up in despair,
making up my mind that death would be a sweet
relief. Casually picking up an old paper, I
noticed the description of a man who had been '

he understands that he will be expected

MARRIED IN HASTE.
Two University Students Become
Man and Wife.
Yesterday, while the senior class of the
University of California was holding its
class day exercises, two youthful fresh
men slipped off to Oakland and were mar
ried by Justice of the Peace Quinn. These
young people were Miss Julia A. Man
chester and W. W. Maekie, both mem
bers of the class of '02. The bride's
brother, George Manchester, and Miss F.
Savage accompanied them on their matri
monial venture. After the ceremony the
quartet returned to the campus and re
mained until the close of the exercises,
when all four took the train for the city
and then for Ventura County, which Is
the home of the bride.
Mr. and Mrs. Mackie have many tastes
in common. They both belong to an en
thusiastic order of Socialists. Mrs. Mac
ule's brother, as head of the society,
found in Mr. Mackie an able lieutenant .
and therefore looked with favor on his
suit. The Manchesters belong to a col
ony of communists, and under their guid
ance Mr. Mackie embraced the theory.
So. when Mr. Mackie in the midst of the
class day exercises asked for his sister's
hand, it would have been against the
laws of communism for Mr. Manchester
to refuse to share her with a brother be
liever.
After the summer vacation Mr. and
Mrs. Mackie will return to Berkeley and
as sophomores will continue their college
education.
Excursion to Ukiah.
The excursion to Ukiah on Sunday, May
21, will afford an opportunity for one of
the most delightful trips in California,
A ride through Marin, Santa Rosa, Rus
sian River and Uklah valleys is always a
pleasure, particularly at this time, for in
the middle of May this most picturesque
section of the Pacific Coast is at its pret
tiest. There is nothing appeals to the
eye more than the acres and acres of
fruit trees, the vine clad hills, and the
mountain ranges with their wooded crests.
For forty-six miles the train skirts the
Russian River. There is no monotony,
but a constant change' of scenery. There
will be plenty of time after arrival at
Uklah to drive around the surrounding
country to visit Vichy Springs, the In
dian rancheria and the asylum.
The fish hatchery of the California
Northwestern Railway Company is in
Gibson Canyon, a most weird and pictur
esque spot. Within the city limits of
Ukiah it is but a comfortable walk or a
short ride from the depot. Here hundreds
of thousands of young trout may he seen
In all stages of development. This will
be an excellent opportunity for the gen
eral public to view a variety of trout here
tofore unknown. Of a rich golden color,
with a mouth somewhat like that of a
snake, and a long, slender body, most
graceful in its curves, the L'kiah golden
trout (as it has been named) is a beauti
ful sight gliding through the water.
Every effort will be made for the com
fort of the passengers, and each one is
fuaranteed a seat. On this trip the i'a!i
ornia Northwestern Railway will run its !
solid train of new passenger coaches just \
received from the East. Most modern in
their design and elegantly equipped, they '
possess ail the latest Improvements for
comfort and safety.
Stages and other vehicles at Ukiah will
take the excursionists to the various
points of interest at low rates. The time I
of departure from Tiburon ferry, foot of
Market street, will be 8:30 a. m. sharp,
and from Ukiah on the return, 5 p. m.,
giving a layover of about four and one
half hours.
Fare for the round trip. $2; children, $1. j
The tickets for this special excursion
can be purchased at ticket offlce, 650 Mar

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 14, 1899.
DID MR. HOLMES
BUILD A FAIRY
CASTLE IN SPAIN?
Queer Disappearance
of an " Heir."
â â
LURED BY RICHES AND RANK
â â
ROMANTIC CONSTANCY OP HIS
PRETTY DAUGHTER.
â¦
Sadie, Once Typewriter at the Palace,
Married Her True Love, and With
Her Mother Only Wants
Papa to Return.
What has become of Frederick
Holmes, sometime associate broker in the
linn of F. M. Petersen & Go., 506 Battery
street? His friends here are asking each
other where he can be and what he can
be doing.
Last April Mr. Holmes left San Fran
cisco to go to Liverpool to take possession
of an estate which was to make him rich
and give his daughter, Sadie Holmes, the
title and estates of Lady Jane Bretherton.
Miss Holmes was employed at the Palace
Hotel as a typewriter, and Mr. Holmes
had just passed through the insolvency
court when the letters informing him 6
his fortune came from London.
A lawyer, li. F. Hamilton of London,
wrote Mr. Holmes that his aunt, Lady
Jane Bretherton, was dead, and that he
and his daughter Sadie were her heirs.
Mr. Hamilton's letter was followed by
further letters from a lawyer in Liverpool
who, represented himself as the adminis
trator of the estate. He said there was
a large- amount of money lying in the
bank for the heir, who must prove his
claim. : â¢".:"..
On the strength of these letters, which
were shown to them, his friends ' raised
a purs,- to defray Mr. Holmes' expenses
to Liverpool.
Miss holmes gave up her position and
waited at home with her mother till the
happy time came when they would all be
rich and she would be Lady Sadie- bretp
erton, mistress of a beautiful castle in
Wales, with its dependent village, where
"my lady" would lind her greatest joy in
being "My Lady Bountiful."
December 1 came- letters from Mr.
Holmes from Liverpool. Everything
was going well and he would bea t home
by Christmas and celebrate their acces
sion to great wealth with his wife and
their seven children.
On December 26 came another letter.
There was some trouble. He had not a
copy of his marriage certificate, and
must go to Panama, where the ceremony
occurred, to procure a copy of the cer
tificate. - . :.' â¢
lie has not been heard from since. A
man Baying he had been a fellow passen
ger with Mr. Holmes from Liverpool to
Panama could give mi clew to the present
whereabouts of Mr. Holmes.
After a few months' silence A. S.
Lowndes, an old friend of Mr. Holmes,
and one of the friends who had wished
him a financial godspeed, wrote to his
nephew, who lives near London. Mr.
Lowndes asked his nephew to go up to
London and see the lawyer. Mr. Hamil
ton, who had tirst written to Mr. Holmes.
Rut there was no such man and no such
lawyer, and now people are wondering
how much of the castles in Wales and
of the castles in Liverpool were castles in
Spain. * .' -
"Burkes Peerage" does not mention
any Lady Bretherton. Whittaker's Al
manac gives ten English Baronesses in
their own right and three Scotch Baron
esses, but neither Welsh nor Irish ladies
who inherit in the direct line the same as
male issue. '." .
Lady Bretherton is not among these
titles. There is an Hon. Mrs. Bretherton-
Stapleton, daughter of Lord Petre, but
she lived in Essex, and, unfortunately for
the' little San Francisco "Countess," had
five daughters, and one son, and has not
yet died. : _. . __
It looks as if even Lady .lane Brether
ton lives in her "castle in Spain." Miss
Sadie, though, has shown herself made of
the right sort of stuff. Her father brought
a wealthy Englishman to his home and
Introduced him to his daughter, urging
her to accept his devotions, and to think
no more of her betrothed, Joe Glaser, a
young tea merchant at 1303 Stockton
street. "Not at all," sale] Miss Sadie.
"Mr. Glaser has loved me when poor; I
Khali love only him when I am rich," and
in defiance of her father's commands she
married her own true love. They are
very happy, and do not care much
whether the castles are in Spain or in
Wales. â 'â  ' -â 'â _. "1_
Mr. Holmes has lived in San Francisco
for a great many years. He is a gentle
man by birth, and left his home in Lon
don in the sixties to seek his fortune.
He went to Panama, and there married
a beautiful girl, the present Mrs. Holmes,
still a remarkably beautiful woman of
the dark Spanish type. Then they went
to Peru, and there Sadie was born. Then
Mr Holmes was American Vice-Consul of
a treat y port of Mexico. Thence he
came to San Francisco in the
very early fifties. His knowledge of
Spanish arid his Central American con
nections helped him to pet the best of the
Central American trade which came to
this port. Mr. Holmes made a great deal
of money and has always provided . well
for his family.
His lifelong friends can find no reason
to allege for his failure to reappear, nor
if his inheritance story is a canard why
he should have perpetrated such an out
rag.- upon his family and friends. He
could have had no reason for deserting
his wife and their large family of chil
dren, who are waiting anxiously for news
of him. , ,
Mrs. Holmes is sure there is some rea
son unknown to any one but her hus
band for his failure to communicate
either with her or his business associates.
She believes Implicitly that he will return
and that everything will be well.
Why he should have gone to Panama
for his marriage record when it could be
so easily obtained by correspondence is a
mystery, ft Is equally mysterious why
he should have raised the hopes of his
daughter and of his family so high if
there was no foundation for his story. If
there were no truth in his tale why does
he not come home, or at least write?

C P. HUNTINGTON'S tenth an
nual banquet to the officials of
the Southern and Central Pa
a ciflc companies took place last
night at the Huntington resi
dence on California street. From every
point from which a banquet may be
viewed it was pre-eminently a success.
The decorations, the music, the menu,
were perfect, and reversing the usual
order, reason played quite as large a
part in the feast as did the flow of soul
and other things. William H. Mills as
toastmaster had his lists excellently ar
ranged and the speeches of Mr. Stubbs,
Mr. Sproule, Rabbi Voorsanger and the
others were of the highest order, Mr.
Huntington's speech was, naturally,
the effort of the evening, and as have
been his other speeches at his ten other
annual banquets that of last night was
remarkable. His speech in full was as
follows:
It gives me pleasure to welcome you to
my house at another of our annual din
ners and to express to you my apprecia
tion of your continued friendship, which
is so gratifying as well as satisfying to
me. We have seen another year pass, and
again we are together to give way in our
brief hours of social reunion to the feel
ings and the thoughts which I know must
occur to each of you as they occur to
me. How many more times, if ever again,
we shall join hands none of us can tell.
With the year passes the century. May
we .all live to see the new one and to en
ter upon it in good health and happiness,
determined to see to it that we will bear
our earnest part in the great work that
is yet to come.
To you young men, who have much of
your lives before you, the twentieth cen
tury opens with a grandeur of possibili
ties almost beyond conception. We have
seen our splendid republic within the
short space of one year make a stride
forward that is to-day the wonder of the
civilized world. There are misgivings
abroad lest we should fail to solve the
great problem we have laid out for our
study; but it is only natural that these
misgivings should exist. Those who look
with jealous eyes upon American ad
vancement find it easy to be apprehen
sive of our ability to succeed, and to fear
for our future, for their apprehensions
and doubts 1 imagine, are born of their
unexpressed perhaps unconscious â hope
that we will fail; in short, it is quite
reasonable to think that the wish is
father to the thought. The world recog
nizes in the struggle now going on across
the Pacific the rising of a star which is
likely to outshine them all. They see tee
day the oldest and the youngest nations
face to face â the United States and China
âone drawing the- feeble breath of old age
and impotent to raise a vigorous arm
against the aggression of those who seem
ready to tear her to pieces and divide the
spoils; the other flushed with the blood
of youth and strength and just emerging
from a century of triumphs in invention,
commercial enterprise, education and ex
perience, which have prepared her to be
the leader of the nations and the master,
if she will, of the world's destinies. ? ;..
The door to Eastern Asiatic trade can
not now be closed, for the American re
public has her foot upon the threshold.
The United States are beginning to under
stand the significance of that phrase so
common to foreign diplomatic policyâ "a
sphere of Influence"â and they arcgoing
to exercise that Influence. Strange peo
ples are to come more into our life, and
these peoples are, by-and-by, going to
render a verdict upon our trial. The
greatest question before the American
Government to-day is, How* shall we deal
with them? in France, liberty, equality
and fraternity have been but names. It
will be the test of our success whether we
can make them facts. 1 hope and believe
that our (lac will continue to have the
meaning of its past wherever it may
waveâ whether in the mainland of the
United States e'er over Its islands of the
seas. I hope that i' will stand for an hon
est and just government, in which every
individual, -without distinction of race or
creed, will be equal before the law. for
only under such a banner can American
citizens hope to gain happiness and en
during success. The history of the world.
I think, shows that where the rights of
the humblest citizen are not equal before
the law to the rights of the highest the
trend of a nation is surely downward, and
no one is safe. Rome was once the master
of the world, but when she reached that
point in her career where her slaves con
stituted the great majority of her popula
tion her decline began and continued to
her fall. Russia was a nation of bar
barians and serfs. She emancipated the
latter and opened a path of progress for
the former; but her present ruler is try
ing to take a step forward and a step
backward at the same time. Before I
left New York J received information that
the Czar had by imperial decree abrogated
the constitution under which the people of
Finland have been allowed, within the Rus
sian jurisdiction, to maintain their special
national character and that he had turned
down this people's petition for mercy.
The result is that they are preparing to
emigrate to some other country.
I at once wrote to our people in San
Francisco, for it seemed to me that here
lay a great opportunity for California,
which needs more citizens. It has been
calculated in recent statistics that the
Russian and English tongues are to be
the ruling languages of the future, but
1 believe the language that we speak here
to-night will be the commercial language
of the world, for it is the language which
has created the. best type of government
and of citizenship. To-day we have the
spectacle of the Czar of Russia trying
to thrill the universe with a brilliant
vision of a great peace congress which
shall put an end to the horrors and cru
elties of war, and at the same time turn
ing a deaf ear to appeals from represent
atives of more than 2,500,000 of his peo
ple who are to-day, in consequence of it,
casting about for new homes under an
alien flag, where they can enjoy the right
to live lives of peace and happiness ac
cording to the dictates of their con
science! .
France, as is well known. Is declining
in population and in real power. She is
a republic, but a republic in uniform.
Her wise men look with great alarm
upon Anglo-Saxon superiority, and are
asking anxiously what is the reason for
The answer, 1 take it, lies largely in
her methods of education, which may be
called a process of forcing the young in
order to prepare them for the govern
ment service. The nation Is bed-ridden
with officialism. As for Germany, an em
inent French writer, speaking of the fail
ure of the French school to fit men for
the struggle of life, has said contemptu
ously: "Germany need not rail at France
for her decline. We are only preceding
her." The German Emperor himself has
said in recent years, speaking of the Ger
man method of education: > "Our school*
have failed, from a practical point of
view, that is, they do not form a man to
succeed." and he urged that the youth
of the country ought to be educated so
as to fit them for. the struggles of life.
And he says further: "Our schools have
given. us too many learned men. They
turn out more learning than Is good for
the nation at large and more than is good
for the individual."
Now, this is a preface to a remark that
I want to make, and that is that I regret
one tendency in our country, admirable
as are her. institutions. It is almost here
sy to say it, but I do not mind taking the
responsibility, for that is one of the
things I am used to. I refer to the in
crease of the higher education for the
masses.. The Anglo-Saxon has easily out
stripped all hiss competitors in those
things which make for - the . commercial
growth and success of nations, because
he has been, above all other things, prac
tical. While the preparation for profes
sional life requires advanced knowledge,
it seems to me that the vast majority of
our young people spend too many of their
vigorous years of youth inside the school
room and not enough in the practical work
of life. The years from 15 to 21 are im
mensely valuable, for they are the years
of keen observation, individuality and
confidence. In many casesâ quite too
manyâ they are spent in cramming the
mind with knowledge that is not likely
to help a young man in the work he is
best fitted to do. How many young men
with college educations are standing
about waiting for something that will
never come because the work that lies
nearest at hand is not to their liking?
Somehow or other our schools, which
teach young people how to talk, do not
teach them how to live. People need lit
tle, but want much. Since I have come to
California one-third of my daily mail is
made up of appeals for help, and these
calls are about equally divided be
tween requests for contributions to
help pay off debts and mortgages
which should not have been con
tracted; applications of young men out
of work, which always have my sympa
thy; and cries for succor from the sick
and sufferinig poor, who must be cared
for, whatever may be the cause of their
sickness or their povertyâ the poor
we have always with us. The sons of
farmers are forsaking the fields because
the cities are more attractive to them.
It seems to me that slowly but surely
there is growing up a stronger
and stronger wall of caste, with
good honest labor on one side
and frivolous gentility on the other. We
seem to be fast outgrowing those things
which, when our fathers lived, were
called sterling qualities, but now are
called follies, or work that a gentleman
should not do, as though all honest work
was not honorable work. The world has
grown small. When I was a boy it was
a very big thing.
I well remember the sad parting which
took place in my town when one of its
families left there to find a new home in
the Genesee country, in New York State.
It was a long journey, and those who said
good-by never expected to meet again.
To-day that family could have , started
out in the morning, got their luncheon
at the place they moved to, and returned
to Connecticut the same night. Benjamin
Franklin once said, as 1 recollect, that
he fully expected to see the time come
when the mails would be carried between
Washington and Boston in ten days with
considerable regularity. What a change
the close of the nineteenth century has
brought us! We can read in to-night's
paper the events which have taken place
all over the civilized world this same day.
We ring a bell in San Francisco and talk
with our friend a thousand miles away
with the same readiness and ease as if
he simply stood behind a curtain.
As I said before, the young man of to
day has a field of action before him that
Is simply bewildering. In San Francisco
we stand opposite the open door of the
Orient, with all the vast possibilities of
trade and commerce implied therein. The
telegraph has put the nations .of
Asia and ourselves into the po
sition of neighbors, and we want
to reap some advantages from that close
connection, for we are nearer to China
than Western Europe is, with no expen
sive canal tolls to pay. 1 do not see why
we should be any more afraid of the
Chinaman than the. people of other coun
tries are. and they will welcome him as
a factor in their development. It seems
to me that. we can afford to give to all a
fair chance and trust to the survival of
the fittestâ not through the sword, but by
the test of Industry, energy, economy and
material practical progress in the things
that make nations great and men invinci
ble. --'â¢-'. Â»H
The outcome in the Philippines, so far
as the control of them by the United
States is concerned, is not doubtful. When
we have once established peace there, the
next question will be how to maintain it.
The Filipinos have shown us that they do
not lack independence of spirit, courage,
determination and perseverance. These
are the qualities which make good citizen
ship in a republic; although there are
others which are necessary in conjunction
with them. These others can be cultivat
ed, and. if the present generation should
not prove susceptible to such education,
the next one may be. It will become our
duty as citizens of a free and enlightened
republic to duly give to the Filipinos a fair
representation with respect to the estab
lishment of government on those islands;
and in the meantime, having ourselves
obtained, through the exigency . of cir
cumstances arising out of our war with
Spain, a foothold in the Orient, the Amer
ican republic must' have a voice among
the great nations which are, as it were,
settling the future of China. I believe we
can. if we will, prevent the disintegration
of that magnificent old empire, whose his
tory runs back into a past so dim and
misty that- no man knows the record of its
year's. I believe It to be in the Interest of
the world that the unity of- that empire

the legitimate prizes of commerce we
want no share in the partition of China,
but we do want the other nations to keep
their hands off and let China stand. We
do want China to give to us and to all
th. commercial privileges which obtain
in successful nations, and we ought to
give to her in return what is her due un

T would take a' book to tell you of the "heroic incidents" of the
Iday, lohg.foretold, on which the so-called Insurgents made their
grand assault oh the American lines about Manila. The situa
tion was a strange one. We were allies at the start and became
enemies through force of circumstances. For years they had
suffered grievous wrongs at ;he hands of the Spa .is. had
battled bravely and persistently for their freedom, had "bottled
up" tic Dons in Manila, Iloilo and a few other fortified towns,
and felt sure of, ultimate victory. For reward their leader had
promised them the suj:'k of Manila, and there is little doubt indis
criminate massacre of the Spaniards would have followed.
The hate of the Filipino for his long-time oppress is something
beyond description. The little islander has been aptly described as
half child, half devil. He is, fanatical as the Turk and more super
stitious than the negro. He is a devout Roman Catholic, a wonder
fully apt scholar, a most accomplished sneak thief, and. when it
comes to lighting, an enemy as utterly without conscience and as
full of treachery as our Arizona Apache He will hoist a whit* flag
and lure you to your death under its folds. He will don the garb
of priest, monk or even sister of charity, come, to you begging alms
and stab you in the back or slit your throat with his keen "bolo"
even as you are giving him aid. He will smile gratefully, guilelessly
up into the face of the surgeon who for weeks has been healing his
wounds and then lay for a chance to shoot or knife his benefactor
the very night he is discharged from hospital. He will come to beg
a. guard for his little homestead and vegetable patch, and shoot the
'guard the moment ... is alone. He' Implored us to respect the holy
Jl>:aracter of his innumerable churches, and he made the very altar
j?..-? arsenalâ siored his Mausers and cartridges under the image, of
the crucified Savior and crammed the church itself with fighting
anen when the hour of outbreak came.
Dozens of our wounded, drifting back to the hospitals, and of
our officers and orderlies riding to and fro among the buildings they
had preserved and protected ere shot down from within the walls
of the sanctuary or those of the native homes. Manila and its sub
urbs were hotbeds of treachery, and these were the people whom
fcr months past wo had ..... ordered to treat with every courtesy
nnd consideration. For three weeks before the outbreak their officers
had boon insulting in language and demeanor to our men.
For six weeks before their assault in force Americans were ar
rested who sought to p.-netrate their linos, yet they were permitted
to wander at will through nurs. "Do everything in your power to
avert conflict,' were our orders, and in spite of all manner of ag
â¢ gressions they were faithfully observed. The line of demarcation
- between the insurgent territory and ours was roughly indicated by
a cordon of block houses extending clear around the suburbs of
Manila from above Tondo on the way to the north to old Fort San
Antonio Abad below Malate to the south.
Major Ceneral Anderson, with the first division, faced the in
surgents between the Pasig River and the bay east and south of the
city. Major General Mac Arthur. with the second division, did like
duty east and north. I commaiyled the first brigade of the first
division covering the lino from tht Paslg to block house 12 in front
of the big towns of Pandacan and Paco. The narrow "estero" of
the Concordia and tho still narrower stream of tin- Tripa de 'Jallina.
formed the line- between my, troops and the Filipinos. Wo knew they
had heavy- redoubts aiyi introm-hments on their side in front of the
big village of Santa Ana. a. mi away, but they were skillfully
screened by tree? and shrubbery. We knew they had Krupp guns,
but we could not ell just where .they were placed.
fTho stone bridge over the Trip in front 0 block house 11 bore
w ' brunt of ail the Incessant traffic between Manila and- the score
â ^ towns along the river, on the. Delta and the south shore of the
lake of which it is the outlet. This was the Insurgent line of supply
and communication. Santa Ana was. the headquarters of.General
Kieartl's division apd their arsenal as well, and this- line, when the
tables wore suddenly turned upon them on the morning of Sunday,
February 5, they defended for an hour with obstinate determination

AT MANILA.
until they found themselves outflanked and caught in a trap. Then
only the reserves escaped. The firing lines were .killed, captured or
driven into the Pasig and drowned. That in brief was the result
of what is called the battle of Santa Ana. fought by the first brigade,
first division, eighth corps and Ricarti's command of the insurgent
army. The pursuit was not dropped until we reached the villages
on the Delta the following day and seem ed their render, but the
heroic incidents went all around the line through both divisions. 1'
shall try *'â  tell you of a lew* that occurred in ours.
It was 2::.0 Sunday morning when the insurgents opened lire on
my line, and long before dawn it spread clear across the front of
General Ovenshine'g brigade, which, facing south. lay to our right,
Not until 8 o'clock, however, could our division commander get the
consent of the Governor General to let us attack. Meantime we had
to "stand and take it"- or, literally, tlie lines lay down and Bred
back across the Tripa as best they could. ..;'< :-,. .;
It was galling work. Many a brave fellow wears the mark of
that night's battling, and a dozen were killed outright before, at
last, we got the word to go in and sweep the field. At that mo
ment Company A of the First Washington Infantry lay close to the
stream facing the flashing lines across the Tripa. Erwin, its first
lieutenant, had been borne to the rear, hoi through the neck and
arm. Two men lay dead In their tracks. Twenty were wounded.
I had galloped forward to give the order, and I shall never forget
how. though covered with mud and stiff with the long constraint,
those splendid fellows sprang to their feet and then, crouching like
Indians, drove down the bank and splashed waist deep through the
Estero. It was there I came upon their captainâ tall, conspicuous
and calm and silent as ever -but covered with blood his head bound
up in a handkerchief, ii" staggered slightly as he toiled up the
opposite bank and. knowing what was ahead of us and that he must
have been painfully wounded, I took the first chance to reach him
and order him back to the- surgeons. He could barely speak, with
his jaw bound tightly, but what he said was practically this: "It..
only a scratch, sir. I .â ."n't let my men go in without me." - //"V
And yet a bullet had scored his face, scraped his cheek hone-- and
ripped through his right ear. It was ids maiden fight, too, but a
veteran of fifty could have been no more composed. That was Captain
Albert H. Otis, Company A, First Washington.
Ten minutes later the dash of two battalions .>;' the Washingtons
1,;,,] cleared the rice fields to the south of the Santa Ana road, and
the Californians, lining the low embankment on which it ran, were
getting in a lively cross fire on the Intrenchments to the north of it.
The Krupp guns were firing rapidly at us from a redoubt close to
the stream and near the east end of Santa Ana. The stone bridge
across the Tripa seemed to be the main target, for shivered glass
from the lamp posts and splintered stone from the parapets flew
with the whistling bullets diagonally^ across the roadway.
None the less two little mountain Hotchkiss guns had been run
forward by hand almost to the arch and there, coolly, placidly direct
ing their fireâ bursting his shells squarely In the Filipino works, and
never even crouching to avoid the Incessant flight of Mauser and
Remington missiles, stood an officer who had already won a name
for daring and skill in tin face of a savage enemy. A Sioux bullet
at the bloody fight at Wounded Knee eight ."cms ago drove frag
ments of bis watch through his body, but in no wise impaired his
efficiency or daunted bis nerve when the next campaign came on.
Between the cool, scientific handling of those guns by Lieutenant
Hawthorne of the sixth Artillery and the fierce and rapid volleys
of the Californians crouching behind the road, the Insurgents lurking
in-hind tin low ridges in th.- rice fields to our left front were driven
to cover further back and their shots flew wild. Then it was pos
sible to rush the First Idaho across the bridge and form it for the
attack or. the redoubts: At the head of the second battalion strode
a veteran soldierâ Major Edward McConnville. He had served as a
private in the great war of the rebellion. He had later .spent-l ong
years In tho regular army as a private and non-commissioned officer.
He at one time carried a musket in the company then commanded
by captain, now Major ..General Anderson, under whose orders he
again found himself when in came as a major to Manila. He was
probably the oldest man in the division- he certainly was in the
brigadeâ but no duty was. so .wearisome or exacting that he did not
carry out his share' of it to the uttermost. The men looked upon
him as a patriarch, but honored, him for his devotion to every detail
Of his soldier work.
I think, now, that' the brave old fellow must have become some
what deaf. He had misunderstood an order I gave him when report
ing to me for instructions as field officer of the/day a fortnight be
fore the fight. This had led to my writing out his orders the nextâ
and last time he reported for the same purpose and the veteran
soldier had taken thisâ in connection with a mild reproof I had given
him for allowing his reserves and supports to be withdrawn before
daylight â very much to heart. In a brigade made up exclusively
of volunteers at the date of. its maiden battle ho was the only officer
I had fell obliged to reprove â and he was an old regular.
: But I .can see him now as he came running to me on the Santa
Ana road just after crossing the bridge. A skirmish line was danc
ing out across the rice fields against the fire-spitting intrehchments
toward the river, and the Jdahos -except three companies sent in to
back up. Washington for the rush into Santa Ana from the south â
were destined to act in support. We had exchanged cordial greet
ings early in the morning, McConnville and 1, when the regiment
reported for duty in East Paco and now his face was aglow, his
eyes blazing with eagerness and .excitement. It had been all planned
that as soon as th.- idahos were across and deployed for the attack
from th.' high road â the southâ that Captain Fortson, with his two
companies of the Washlnfftons, should ford the Concordia and attack
from the west the first . and most formidable of the redoubtsâ now
fully "located" on a singular mound rising from the midst of a
level plain.
"Yonder are the works, major," were the words of the order.
"Cross th" fields in front e.i the Norwegian Consul's house (a big
stone affair that stood close to the stream three hundred yards to
the left of th.- road). and charge everything into the river."
California was to support on the right, Fortson on his left, but
he never stopped to inquire. Eagerly .he answered "All right,- sir,"
and hastened to the head of his men. Eagerly he led them over
tin- field and, in his eagerness, got mixed as to the Consul's house
and passed behind, instead .of in front of it. so that it took ten
minutes to straighten him out, but then with cheers and volleys the
lines rushed in. â¢ ** ";. . 'â¢ -
Just as the center of the Idahos reached a little clump of trees
and shrubbery half way across the plain they were greeted by a
sudden and furious volley that staggered them. In an instant
McConnville leaped to the front, waving his sword over his head
and shouting to his men. "Come on! Come "ii. Idaho!" and then, as
he turned and led the rush into the. shrubbery, a shot struck him
square, in the breast and down he went. Even then, they told me,
he strove' to crawl forward with the lino, but the wound was mortal,
and presently the brave old fellow realized that he had but an hour
or two to live. I never saw him again. The order he received from
my lips on the Santa Ana road was his last and to the letter had
he striven to obey it. . '," '
Five insurgents lay do.ad about the Krupp in the middle redoubt,
where, side by side, California arid Idaho leaped in to the capture,
and a dozen lay strewn over the field in front of where the honored
. id major fell. .The big redoubt on thi mound to his left was littered
with the bodies of the insurgents. Hemmed in between McConnville,
Fortson and the river and unable to .boat back the dashing charge
of the "Americanos" they raised the white flag and then shot dead
the first soldiers to reach the work. Th" roar of musketry was re
sumed, for three,; minutes ami followed by scattering shots as the
fugitives ran fur the stream, lint there was a smile on McConnville's
grizzled face as they bore him off the field. â¢''*â¢'_ f.-
Everything had been swept to the river. All these redoubts were
won. Both the Krupps were ours and there were places where the
Insurgents lay two deep in the trenches. As the main line made its
grand wheel to the left and. charging into Santa Ana from the south,
"rounded up" the insurgents who strove to escape along the bank,
Captain Cunningham of the : First California caught sight of. a
big "casco" or barge crammed with tit" enemy '.poling" over to the
opposite shore. In less .than no time he -had .-his company lined up
behind the convent ine!,. sure through which they had fought their
way and opened fire. In five minutes up ..went the white flag across
the stream and. under rover of the rifles of a whole battalion by
this time ranged along the bank. Cunningham went over, found the
Insurgent captain and five men dead, several mortally and seventeen
Slightly Wounded, and made the whole detachment prisoners.
-But while the first brigade had carried out its plan of battle
without appreciable check there -was some hard work in front of the
Fourteenth' Infantry (regulars) of Ovenshine's (second) brigade
farther to the right. Here in the thick woods the insurgents, had
thrown up breastworks and possessed themselves of block house 14â
once occupied by our men, but later abandoned because of the length
of the liii" and the small number of troops to. defend it. Both in
front of the first and second brigade, but especially in front of the
first at Santa Ana bridge, the same condition of affairs was found
to, exist. : -- ;rr : V . - ' . .-â  - .;,',- ". : . < ' >â  â¢'â¢

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, MAY 14, 1899.
â¢ Only five. men responded to the call, and with those five Miles
made his dash. Full tilt they charged through the storm of hissing
lead that greeted but could not stop them. Two of the daring five
dropped in their tracks, but Miles darted on and the Filipinos, amazed
at such dauntless courage and fearful of their fate when the Ameri
cans reached the block house, came scurrying down from the upper
stories. Possibly they were afraid it might be fired and they be
burned alive. Possibly they were awed by the prospect of; hand to
hand fight with big fellows who were proof against their Mausers,
but down they came and out they wentâ last Filipino rushing
from the back door as Miles, revolver in hand, sprang in at the front.
It was a desperate chance and one of the bravest, pluckiest things
of the day. , - . HCyi-
But here is another that calls for the modal of honor, if I un
derstand it aright. The military telegraph line, before the battle
began, extended on our front to block house. 11. close to the Santa
Ana bridge. The officers of the signal corps followed up the move
ments of the brigade and stretched their wires far jto the front.
But the line ran through the village of Pacoâ nest of insurgents
out of uniform, therefore all the more dangerous. Paco church was
found to be a stronghold of the rascals early in the day, and dozens
of the villagers' houses proved to be only lurking places for assas
sins in the garb of peaceâ the white, every-day dress of the Filipino.
Of course it was not long before church and huts innumerable
were In flames and the lurking occupants hunted out, but the huge
stone tower of Paco church refused to burn and there, safe sheltered
until we could smash it with artillery, and fanatical to the last a
party of perhaps half a dozen insurgents kept up an incessant fire
on Americans whose duties compelled them to cross Paco bridge
on the one line of communication between Santa Ana and the city.
' Toward ,11 o'clockâ right at the telegraph pole in front of the
church and not two hundied yards from it the wire was clipped,
and a young signal officer, â¢ Lieutenant Charles E. Kilbourne Jr.,
springing back to find the break, was saluted by a volley.
"Get away from there, for ''.oil's sake'" yelled some soldiers,
who, from the shelter of the village walls, were trying to answer
the fire from the tower. ,
"Ride for your life, man!" shouted some horsemen who dashed
by full speed and bending low over their . pommels, but Kilbourne
was made of better stuff. . â¢
"Swept away, at first, by. the excited rush of the stampeded riders
he regained control of his pony, reined him about, rode deliberately
back to Paco, dismounted at that identical pole, climbed it to th<*
very top in the face of a. galling fire that clipped a second wire
while he was repairing the first, calmly, pluckily, skillfully mended
both wires in plain sight of half a 'dozen officers and. a score of men
sheltered* by the walls up and down the blazing Calle Real. Then
mounted and rode on about his other business.
If that wasn't pluck .and heroism I'm no judge of either.
run if attacked and would certainly recoil before a determined stand.
For weeks the little sinners officers and men â would come out to the
bridge, whet the "bolos" on the stone parapet and dare our sentries
to fight. As they drove or rode through our lines and our sentries
saluted the officers as they were ordered, the latter often jeered and
taunted them, though they behaved with exemplary -propriety when
meeting parties of our officers. The Filipino's, seeing and hearing all
this, were impatient for the attack to begin, believing all Manila
would be theirs and the Americans even easier, victims than the
Spaniards.
This was the explanation of their dash and spirit when assaulting
early Sunday morning and of their obstinate defense, for a while at
least, when our lines advanced. Now. Ijcan only tell from hearsay
of the gallant act of a young officer of tne Fourteenth regulars, but
it is the talk of the First Division, and has won him the recommenda
tion for the medal .if honor. A battalion of the regiment, checked
by the fierce fire from the thickets in their front and dispirited by Its
severe loss in killed and wounded, was lying down for shelter. One
of its lust and bravest officers. Lieutenant Mitchell, lay dying in their
midst, when Lieutenant Perry L. Miles, an Ohio boy, only four, years
out of West Point, was suddenly called upon to report to his com
manding i 'Hirer.
In brief words the battalion chief gave him orders: "That block
house must be taken at onceâ I want you to de. it." Miles is
one of the "quietest" young fellows in the service and he probably
went off without a word. As the story comes to me, it was decided
that he should call for volunteers, and he did. The men looked at
the bristling block house a few hundred yards away and shook their
heads. It was crammed with insurgents, and the only way to reach
it was a straight road with dense bamboo and underbrush on each
side. .It was a lane of death and the soldiers knew it.18
THE
PEACE
CONGRESS
AT THE
MAGUE.
IS the International Peace Conference
to be held in The Hague next Thurs
day. May 18, going to be merely a
pleasant junket for a lot of nice old
gentlemen, who will pass harmless
resolutions in favor of peace, have a
banquet and go home again unmoved; or
is it to mark the opening of one of the
most significant chapters in the world's
history?
Outside the circle of those who are es
pecially Interested there seems to be only
a vague notion about the importance of
the coming event. As the affair is being
conducted wholly by the various Govern
ments, comparatively little has been said
about it. Governments not being much
given to taking the public Into their con
fidence.
For this unique meeting, fraught with
untold, incalculable possibilities for th*
future of the world, the favorite palace
of Queen Wilhelmina of Holland has been
chosen. Hardly more imposing than the
country residence of many a wealthy
commoner, the Huis Ten Bosch, or House
in the Woods, is surrounded by nature un
adorned, in striking contrast to her
clipped and artificial garb as it Is gen
erally found In Holland.
Most remarkable In Its interior Is the
Orange Hall, where the conference will
probably hold its sessions. This is an oc
tagonal chamber, with walls fifty feet
high. Light from a cupola and side win
dows sets off work of the most famed
painters of the Rubens school, Including
a vast allegorical painting of the apothe
osis of Prince Frederick Henry by Jor
daens.
Elsewhere in the palace are rooms con
taining costly presents to past Princes of
Orange from such Oriental potentates as
the Mikado, the Emperor of China and
the Viceroy of Egypt and the East India
Company. In the dining-room are mar
velous illusions painted by Jacob de Wit
In the first half of the last century, only
the closes! Inspection of which shows
them not to be the bas-reliefs that their
mythological subjects are made- to ap
pear. There are, too, Chinese tapestries
of rice paper dating from the eighteenth
century. The prevalent tone of the place
in one of cultured taste well worthy of the
House of Orange.
. Whether it be decided to treat the dele
gates as national guests and distribute

What Will the Conference DoP
Europe is on the tiptoe of Interest, and
that attitude is shared by many here, to
see what will be accomplished by this
unique gathering. Â.'â â¢
Will it be the ruling Influence in future
history? Will it be the most colossal
farce of the age? Will it prove for good
or ill?
Such, and so various, are the questions
asked by eager curiosity. And none can
answer in advance. But the hope of all
and _Se expectation of most Is that the
mere fact that an assembly of this nature
could .be summoned by a sovereign of
such sort must be an influence for good.
On August 29 last the world was startled
by publication of the news that the Czar
absolute monarch of one of the most
heavily armed nationsâ had issued an ap
peal to the powers for a reduction of ex
cessive armaments and the maintenance
of peace. Through Count Muravieff, For
eign Minister, the Czar handed a note to
the diplomats in St. Petersburg, placing
his ideal before their respective Govern
ments. Here are some of the passages
from his appeal:
International discussion Is the most
effective means of insuring all pie's
benefitâ real, - desirable peace, above
all putting an end to the progressive de
velopment of the present armaments.
In the course of the last- twenty years
the longing for general appeasement
has grown especially pronounced in the
consciences of civilized nations, and the
preservation of peace has been put for
ward as an object of International pol
icy. It is In its name that great States
have concluded between themselves pow
erful alliances.
It is the better to guarantee peace
that they have developed in proportions
hitherto unprecedented their military
forces, and still continue to increase
them without shrinking from any sacri
fice.
The financial changes following the up
ward march strike at the very root of
public prosperity. Moreover, in propor
tion as the armaments of each power In
crease they less and less fulfill the object
the governments have set themselves.
The economic crisis, due in great part
to the system of armaments "a l'ou
trance," and the continual danger which
lies ln this massing of war material, are
transforming the peace of our days into
a crushing burden, which the peoples
have more and more difficulty In bear
ing.
To put an end to these Incessant arma
ments and to seek the means of warding
off the calamities which are threatening
the whole world, such Is the supreme
duty to-day Imposed upon all States.
Czar's Motives Discussed.
Then began a discussion as to the good
faith of a ruler who dared thus to voice
the opinions long held by all European
governments.
Scoffers scoffed at the idea as utterly
futile. Dreamers dreamed that they al
ready saw the dawn of the millennium.
Some declared the suggestion preposter
ous. Others hailed it as already fulfilled.
Conservative folks thought the experi
ment was worth making, whatever Its
result, sine** nothing could well be worse
than the endless chain of progressive tax
ation binding the hands of commerce in
a peace only less exacting than war. And
everywhere the tendency was for the
overburdened people to favor the plan
and for cynical officialdom to deride Its
feasibility in secret, while outwardly bow
ing to popular demand.
And so matters dragged along until on
the eve of the new year Count Muravleff,
at the Czar's behest, addressed another
circular to the powers, with the sugges
tion that the conference be not held in
the capital of any great power, where
many political interests center which
might impede its work.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 14, 1899.

circular as matters for preliminary con
sideration by the powers, to be discussed
at the conference: Tv

and at the same time not to Increase

HOW TRADE with the PHILIPPINES has INCREASED
THE American occupation of the
Philippines has estabjished an
export trade from San Franclsce
direct to Manila for the first time
in the commercial history of this
city, and this imparts some interest to
cold figures.
Since Oriental exports from San Fran
cisco began the books of the Custom
house have been bare of the word of
"Manila" up to the time that 20.000
American soldiers with Yankee wants
went into camp there. Up to that time
whatever little jugs of canned goods,
etc., strayed into Manila from here al
ways went hilled to Hongkong, whence
a trifling proportion sometimes leaked
down to the Philippines. With Septem
ber last the Custom-house auditor nut
a Manila column in his books, and its
total for that month was $984. For Oc
tober the showing was $6476, and for
November $19,709. December will show
another large increase.
These totals represent merchandise
billed direct to Manila, and do not in
clude goods* intended for Manila but
billed to Hongkong for transfer: neither
do they include any of the Government
supplies sent in transports. In Novem
ber there was shipped from San Fran
cisco to Hongkong for Manila consump
tion 54,000 dozen bottles of beer, valued
at $40,735. The value of this one item
was more than double the total ship
ments billed direct to Manila. Smaller
amounts of other merchandise were
similarly billed to Hongkong for Ma
nila. There is thus no possibility of
getting exact figures unless they come
from the Custom-house at Manila.
Hongkong is a free port, and statistics
are not compiled there. â¢..â¢"!
In estimating the significance of this
new trade it must be borne in mind
or other similar engines of destruction.
To give an undertaking not to construct
vessels with rams In the future.
To apply to naval warfare the stipula
tions of the Geneva convention of 1864
In the basis of the articles added to the
convention of ISO'S. *
To neutralize ships and boats employed
ln savins those overboard during or after
an engagement.
To raise the declaration concerning
the law;- and customs of war elaborated
in 1874 by the conference of Brussels,
which has remained unratified to the
present day.
To accept in principle the employment
of. th" stood offices of mediation and
facultative arbitration in cases lending
themselves thereto, with the object of
preventing armed conflicts between na
tions; an. understanding with respect to
the mode of applying these good offices,
â¢ and the establishment of a uniform
practice In using them.
Nowhere did the Czar's proposition find
a more hearty response than in Great
that it has and will have two causes.
One is the demands of the American
army and navy there, outside of what
are met by the quartermaster and com
missary departments, and the other is
the patronage of the permanent popu
lation. .
The boys in duck are, so far, the
cause of this Increased trade.
The steamer Hupeh, that sailed a few
days ago, carried 3500 casks of beer and
2500 gallons and 62 cases of wine. In
November the wine billed direct to Ma
nila was valued at $2600. and much
whisky has been forwarded. There are
plenty of Yankee, saloons in Manila
now, and the advertisements of Ameri
can cocktails look odd '._ the papers
from there.
Canned meats and ham and bacon
made up nearly half the November
direct shipments and this seems to con
firm suspicions about the rations.
Other items were drugs, malt, milk,
butter, etc. These things with a large
variety of general merchandise are
typical of the trade. It will vary |as
tin- army of occupation.
How the natives and Spanish are
taking to American goods is not re
ported. Manila shopkeepers in catering
to the soldier trade are getting in
American goods more or less and this
gives- them an inch of foothold that
will spread, and it makes the strange
things known. They are bought now
and then out of curiosity, at least as
the great American cocktail is curi
ously sampled. Merchants here real
ize that the army is a big band of
drummers for American goods. The
average patriotic - soldier will 'recom
mend something American whenever he
gets a chance among Spanish or Fil
ipino acquaintances and things Ameri
can will thus be more rapidly knitted
to the population.
There has been a remarkable dispro
portion between United States imports
and expoTts in the Philippine trade.' In
1896 America imported $2,701,651 worth
of hemp and $1,199,202 worth of sugar

â¢to Russia. -'Â©'â¢-'. *
. Scores of meetings in favor of the plan
have been held in England to adopt reso
lutions to be forwarded to Lord Salis
bury urging the most hearty co-operation.
Meanwhile the Premier had already
promised the sympathetic action of her
Majesty's Government. In his reply to
the first circular he said:
The statements which constitute the
grounds of the Emperor's proposal, areâ¢â¢
but too well justified. It is unfortu- .
nately true that while the desire for the
maintenance of peace. is generally pro--,
fessed, and â¢ while, in fact, serious and
successful efforts have on more than one
recent occasion been made with that ob
ject by the great powers, there has been

a constant tendency on the part of al
most every nation to increase Its armed
force and to add to an already vast ex
penditure on the appliances of war. The
perfection of the instruments thus
brought Into use, their extreme costli
ness and the horrible carnage and de
struction which would ensue from their
employment on a large' scale have acted
and little else, the total being $4,383,740.
Spain was hardly a better customer.
Our total exports of that year were:
Cotton manufactures, $2164; 0i15, 545,908;
varnish, $2239, and all other articles
$44,286. Total, $94,597. Indirect exports
via Hongkong would not increase this
total much. Our monthly exports, ex
clusive of military supplies, are now
probably larger.
However, American trade is yet only
.on the skirmish line in the Philippines.
y\r.ti-Marriage Glub
AN anti-marriage club, the existence
of which has caused an upheaval
in the city of Appleton, Wis., has
for its purpose the abjuration of
marriage among the bachelors of the
place. The official name of this young
men's organization is the Marble Heart
Anti-Matrimonial Association of Apple
ton, Wis. Its members are called Marble
Hearts, and the society has a regular
constitution, by-laws and officers.
Each member pays an initiation fee of
$2. and annual dues of $10. All funds are
banked and the expenses are nil. When
a member joins he is bound by a most
solemn vow not to marry, but should he
break that vow he relinquishes all right
to the funds of ' the organization. The
last Marble Heart to remain unmarried
is given all the funds of the society and
may then marry if he wishes.
The society has been organized for
some time, but until a few days ago its
existence' was a secret, known only to
the members. At first . the number of
Marble Hearts .was limited to twelve, "but
this was enlarged so as to take in nearly
all the young men of the city who are
prominent in society.
Those who are disposed to regard the
affair as a joke should consult the young
women or the Marble Hearts themselves.
As for the former, they are banded in
an organization, every member of which
vows she will never, under any condi
tions, marry an Appleton man. As the
girls have not a roster of the antis, they
have included all the unmarried men of
the city In their black list.

no doubt as a serious deterrent from
war. But the b_rdens Apposed by this
process on the population* affected must,
if prolonged, produce a feeling of un- |
rest and discontent menacing both to in- '
ternal and external tranquility.
All ."this ',. time Russia, .Germany, France
and England have been increasing their |

Britain having publicly made her pros

results of the conference. ~.. '..
Italy Causes -Friction.
Friction arose over . Italy's refusal to
send a representative to the conference if
the Vatican were allowed to participate.
The Quirinal took the ground that a Pa
pal delegate at the conference would
mean the recognition of the Pontiff as a
temporal power such as he no longer is.
It is believed that it was to avoid the
settlement of this dilemma and throw the
onus on I the host that the Czar asked
Holland to send out the formal' invita
tions for the conference' at The Hague.
This point has apparently been settled
by withholding an invitation to the Vati
can, the Papal Internuncio having conse
quently â¢ been temporarily withdrawn
from The Hague, though it is believed in
some quarters that the French delegates
will tell the conference that they also
represent the Pope, and so new trouble
with the Quirinal may arise.
In this connection a militant Italian
prelate, when the question' of Papal rep
resentation and the possible raising of the
Pope's temporal pawerwere under dis
cussion, recently said:
Whether we be Invited or not, the re
sult will be the same. Why cry peace,
peace, when there is no peace? The fear
- of reprisals for her theft of the Pope's <
domain drove Italy Into the triple alli
ance and Into ruinous military expendi- â¢
ture. Shall we sanction peace and dis
armament before the church has her
own again? Crushed by her armaments,
Italy ls now tottering on the brink of
destruction. Shall we stretch out our
arm to save her? Never! Whether we
are Invited or not, your Russian ship of
fools, with its Utopian crew, will be
wrecked on the rock of St. Peter.
In St. Petersburg a commission of jur
ists has been hard at work examining
existing treaties between and question..
dividing the Powers to provide a source
of ready reference and information for
use at, The Hague, where a. self-denying
ordinance will be sought from delegates,
all anxious that any self-denial about the
proceedings shall be equally distributed.
It is understood that the conference will
organize into three sections, chosen by
lot, each having its own president and its
own branch of work. One section will es
pecially consider disarmament or reduc
tion of peace , effectives. . Another will
make arbitration its study, and the third
will be the initiative body and also dis
cuss subsidiary questions. Their three
presidents will form a board of arbitra
tion in the event of preliminary differ
ences. Each section will report to the
full conference, to which all decisions will
be left. -'â  ; -v : ' v

Tolstoi /
on the
Peace Congress.
IT is the return of the Utopians,
declares the great modern apostle
of peace, Tolstoi, the man who
gave the initiative in the matter to
the Czar. For a third of a cen
tury Tolstoi has with tongue and pen
been a constant advocate of- the dis
banding of armies and the dismantling
of navies.
A peculiar interest attaches itself at
this time to the views and expectations
of Count Tolstoi as to what the results
of its work will be. jÂ±.
At the time the circular of invitation
to the nations was issued neither Tol
stoi nor his teachings were in the en
joyment of the Czar's favor; his writ
ings were proscribed and forbidden
circulation under very heavy penalties
throughout Russia. â ..-:"
In the closing months of last year,
just after Count Muravieff's memorable
peace circular had been addressed to
the powers, Tolstoi's admiring and ap
preciative countrymen were preparing
to celebrate in a fitting manner the
seventieth anniversary of the birth of
the great author of "War and Peace."
At the same time the imperial office of
censorship sent out another circular
forbidding any and all journals
throughout the empire to ever mention
the anniversary of Tolstoi. ..-J^r
No manifestation was held in tha
whole of the Russian domain, though
telegrams poured in from every other
part of the civilized world, proving to
Tolstoi the sincere admiration in which
he was held, recognizing . him as the
real initiator of the new movement for
universal peace and congratulating him
on the visible fruit his teachings had
borne. . â¢^*'': s *'-':?;'...- ':-â  yy.

Ao Expedition Now Being Outfitted in San Francisco to Sail for the Island on Which the Australian Treasure Styp Was Wrecked With Over Half a Million Dollars in Gold Dust

THERE Is a party of enthusiastic
treasure hunters at present fining
out in this city to make another at
tempt for the gold that lies burled
Jn the hold of the American ship
General Grant. A low estimate
places the buried treasure at half a rail
lion dollars.
Of all the strange stories of shipwreck
that have ever been told that of the Gen
eral Grant in 1*66 is surely one of the
strangest. The vessel was driven into a
cave on Adam Island, one of the Auck
land group, just south of New Zealand.
There was plenty of water underneath
her, but the rise and fall of the swell
within the cave caused her masts to
punch against the top of the cavern. This
wrought havoc with the decks and then
the bottom. The mainmast was driven
clear through the keel and a flood of
water sank the vessel in flve minutes.
The greater number of those on hoard
perished and the sufferings of the sur
vivors before they were rescued eighteen
months later is almost beyond belief.
The General Grant was a fine full
rigged sailing ship of 1200 tons, and was
owned in Boston by an extensive shipping
firm. The voyage which she had lately
completed from Boston to Melbourne was
her maiden trip.
For the return voyage the General
Grant was billed to England. They were
wild and eventful time', ln those early
years of Australian gold diggings, and
what with the "bushrangers." "sharpers"
and escaped convicts and the like, the
miners' life was often a short and rarely
a merry one. They had to maintain their
rights with a strong arm, which often
proved awkward to the bully and the
thief. It was of such men that the pas
senger list of the General Grant was
largely composed men who had toiled
bard and with their well-earned gold were
returning m their old homes in Merry
England. There were eighty-three souls
on board. In addition to the general
cargo there was on commodity on board
of far greater value, fnr stowed away in
some safe nook in the captain's cabin and
t known only to a few trusted men were
several boxes containing each 1000 ounces
of gold, valued at about IIS.OOO each. This
was the gold that was Insured, and in ad
'itinn to this there was the individual
wealth of 'tie returning miners, carried
privately, including a large amount of
jewelry.
On May 4. IWS. the General Grant set
Bail. When clear of Tort Phillip Heads
the tug was cast off and with her canvas
spread t.i the breeze the doomed vessel
sped away on her course to the eastward.
and as a call had to he made at New Zea
land a course was shaped so as to make
the middle island of that colony: hut by
tome extraordinary circumstance which
no one of the survivors seemed ever able
to explain the vessel passed away south
of hpr intended course.
At four bolls in the first watch (10 p. m.)
of May 13. just one week out from Mel
bourne, the "lookout" man reported land
on the "lee beam" three or four miles
distant. At first it was thought to be a
fog or cloud bank. The wind was a light
southwesterly one. but there was a very
heavy swell on the sea. The vessel was
kept to the southeastward, and in a short
while the land became more clear and
distinct, and it was soon ascertained
that -..,.. were on the weather side of
Disappointment Island.
Toward midnight the entire Auckland
archipelago lay before em and the cap
tain resolved to shape a course between
Disappointment and the mainland, but at
this most critical moment the Wind fell
and it was soon painfully evident that the
heavj- swell was rapidly drifting the.
dnnrried ship toward the rocky , shore.
Everything was done to avert th* inevit
able disaster and the sails were continu
ally "trimmed" to catch every breath of
wind that would help the vessel's "Steer
age way." but these little puffs became
feebler and feebler, till at last not a
breath remained. The vessel was entirely
shut off by the high cliffs, against which
the sea roared. Winter In this hemi
sphere had commenced and the sky was
intensely covered with thick clouds, the
night was .lark and the air was murky
with mist.
Boon after midnight the ship was so
close to the cliffs that a stone could have
been thrown against them, but a current
evidently drifting her along on a parallel
line to the shore kept her clear of the
rocks until about 1 a. m.. when all pro
gress in this direction was stopped by the
vessel striking against a projecting por
tion of the cliff. Th â¢ jibboom snapped
with a noise Ilk a thunder clap and with
the foretopmast staysail was carried
away. The poor General Grant trembled
from stem to stern with the force of the
shock, recoiled and went astern for a few
hundred yards, but alas she was doomed
to meet the same fate and her backward
course was arrested by another ma of
projecting rock, upon which her stern
struck heavily, carrying away her rudder
and spanker boom.
The man at the wheel had no time to
escape, being struck by the shattered
boom and mortally Injured. It was be
tween these two proleotinig points that
the vessel began rapidly to drift, each suc
ceeding swell urging her inward little by
little, and it was soon apparent to every
one the cliff was "opening out" instead
of "narrowing." and that the ship was
drifting bows foremost into one of those
great rifts caused by the erosion and the
action of the sea.
Lights were hung out on the ship's side
and by means of their glimmer both pas
sengers and crew COUld see that they were
surrounded on all sides by a great wall 'if
smooth rock rising to an immense height.
Behind them the big waves rolled in and
drove the vessel still forward, while In
front of them all was blackness. Deeper
and deeper into the rift they went and
then a cry of horror arose from every
mmi': for by the flicker of the lights on
the great masses of rock overhead they
saw that the cliffs had closed together
above them, and then the awful truth
dawned upon them that their vessel had
drifted into a great ocean cavern, there to,
be beaten and broken to pieces by the
fury of the waves. The captain now
gave orders to have the boats cleared
away.
As the ship drove inch by inch Into the
cave the tall masts began to scrape the
roof of the immense cavern an d immense
masses of earth and rock commenced
raining down upon those below. Nothing
more terrible can be imagined than this
deadly shower from the blackness over
head, combined with the agony of uncer
tainty. 'â¢.:/.
The frightened and terrified passengers
hurried aft and together they huddled to
avoid the falling stones which fell with
every heave and rise of the vessel. A
sounding taken at this time showed that
the depth was five fathoms under the
keel. To get boats out in this terrible
darkness would have been madness. So
th.re was nothing to ..,. done but patient
ly wait until daybreak.
As the night advanced the wind and
waves Increased and broke with redoubled
vigor Into the cafe, which caused the
vessel to rise against the roof of the
cave with great force. The fore topgal
lant mast came down with a crash, amid
a tangled mass of cordage and blocks.
Next came the foretopmaat, soon after,
accompanied by great bowlders and
masses of rock which became loosened
and came crashing down on the deck. As
the spars came down the vessel surged
further into the cave, and soon the fore
mast came crashing down.
When daylight was breaking the mlz
zen topgallant mast came down, and this
decided the captain to hesitate no longer,
so the order was given to lower the boats,
as it was now almost Impossible. for any
"IN A FEW MOMENTS THE WAVES WERE BREAKING
OVER HER."
one to keep uninjured so long as they re
mained on board. -'..":"
The utmost order. had prevailed during
this fearful and trying ordeal, but after
daylight all was confusion and panic.
Some leaped madly overboard, while oth
ers so crowded the boats as to nearly
swamp them. Home few sick and dis
heartened ones refused to leave the ship
at all. But If the terror of the situation
and the hope of self-preservation had
driven most of the passengers into a
panic there 'was one brave man who kept
cool and self-possessed, and it would be
impossible to overestimate the services
which noble James Teer rendered to his â¢
fellow-passengers on that awful morning.
He kept the boats from overloading and
many lives from being lost by his cool
ness and courage.
The General Grant had only three boats
on board two quarter and one longboat.
The two quarter-boats had been lowered
and were engaged in picking up those of
the passengers and crew who were strug
gling for life in the water. In one of the
boats, in which was Tier, there was a
quantity of beef, pork and bouillon. The

long boat of 20-feet keel was manned by
a few Bailors and filled with passengers,
chiefly the women and children. The dif
ficulty of launching this boat was soon
solved, for as one wave bigger than its
fellows rUshed in and lifted up the ship
on its crest, the mainmast struck the
rocks above so forcibly that the heel was
driven through the bottom of the hull
and In a few moments the waves were
breaking over the deck.
The captain and one of the passengers
climbed up Into the rigging. The long
boat glided off the sinking deck Into the
water, leaving behind it two or three un
fortunate beings. The boat was pulled
rapidly to the mouth of the cave to join
the others, but before it was a hundred
yards from the ship a heavy sea. a swift
eddy and' the great weight of the passen-
gers caused it to founder, and all its
occupants were left screaming and fight
ing for life in the angry waves. Two of
the crew and one passenger were picked
up by Teer, but the rest were drowned.
In their endeavor to save these last the
people in Teer's boat came right across
the mouth of the cavern just in time to

young women who want husbands
and of her young colonists in

France has her share of the "white

about it. When she put her arms around
the island of Madagascar she got what

There is a great country so many miles
from home that the settlers must often
depend upon themselves and the natives.
The natives were not '. more overjoyed
than is usual to have the white man take
up his burden and tell the black man
what to do to be saved. Of course it is a
good thing for them, but it takes a white
I man's army to make them see It that
.way. There. is only one real solution of
the problem for France, and that Is to
get people to go. there and live, to get
property interests there and each to look
after his own corner and help civilize the
island. France offered the colonists
every inducement to stay, gave them
land and protection and offered a market
for the vanilla and coffee and indigo they
grow, but the Frenchmen said, "What is
home without a. wife?" and would not
stay, even /though they might be doing
well financially.*
So mother France smiles and says, "I'll

see the last death throes of the General
Grant. The hull was entirely under wa
ter and the broken masts were all that
remained above. She went down before
the eyes of Teer and his companions,
who saw the water crawling up the
masts quicker and quicker and over the
heads of the few luckless beings who
screamed for the aid that could not be
given. Over the head of the last passen
ger to be seen went the heaving waters
and then over the mizzen top where the
captain stood. The light was dim, but
Terr and his companions were able to
discern a dark figure waving a white
handkerchief as a last adieu, when the
figure sank and the sullen waters of the
cavern closed over all, and those in the
boat knew that they had parted forever
from their captain and their ship.
The two boats containing in till fifteen
souls who had succeeded in escaping the
dangers of the cavern wore both wofully
lacking' in necessaries. The people were
only .scantily clad, and in tin- panic had
omitted to bring with them tools or
clothes or anything that would be ser
viceable.
The occupants of the two craft held a
consultation as to what was best to be
done.
At first the two boats tried to make

count of the ugly weather. They were
beaten and battered about in the break
ers for hours, and then finally made a

of single girls in France who
are ready to go to the distant
island. They are the girls' who work
for a few cents a day. When one can
buy in San Francisco a linen handker
chief for 25 cents that took a girl in
France at least two days to embroider,
one can count up about what these girls
must earn. Our laundry girls at 30 cents
a day earn fortunes beside them.
"When the Government made the an
nouncement that it would give the girl
a gift of $60. a trousseau worth â¢>-". and
free transportation to Madagascar, with
the prospect of a rich husband, her own
home, servants and horse and carriage
even. it was like offering her a seat in
heaven. ,
More than a hundred young women ap
plied to the Government and offered to
go out to the island. The offer required
them to be between 22 and 30 years of
age, healthy and of the best character
and industrious. Birth certificates, phy
sician's certificates, employers' certifi
cates were presented, and then twenty
girls were chosen.
After that the shopping began, with an
inspector to decide. And $20 will buy an
endless variety of things for a very poor
girl in Paris.
Be sure that every girl was ready when
the time for sailing came, and they said
"au revoir but not good by." for every
one hoped to return some time and show
her friends how she had prospered.
There was no definite idea' of who
should marry whom, but photographs had
been exchanged. The planters were all
well to do, but they could not get away
from the island plantation for any length
of time because they employed hundreds
landing not far from the cave in which
their vessel had been wrecked. -â 
Thus, thoroughly exhausted with the
labors of a night and a day and the want
of food and water, fourteen men and one
woman, wretched beings, poorly clad and
shivering with cold,, huddled together on
the irk to pass their first night 'on shore.
The air was chilly with mist, with occa
sional snow,. which blew upon their faces
and exposed limbs, for shelter there was
absolutely none.
The history of these poor survivors for
the next week is nothing but a record of
terrible heartbreaking sufferingâwander
ing along the desolate shores by day in
search of food and water and huddling
together at night in the less exposed part
of the rocks for warmth. The temptation
to consume their stock of meat saved
from the wreck was terrible, hut Teer, a
born leader, would not hear of it.
During this week their principal food
was some varieties of shellfish and what
else- they found among the rocks. The
days were getting shorter and the mid
more Intense, and the mists and snows
of the Antarctic came rolling up on them
from the southward.
The cold Increased daily, and it was
soon evident that unit fire was ob

One of the Most Curious Wrecks on Record, Â£
Of all strange stories of shipwreck that of the General Grant is
one of the strangest. In 1866, while on a voyage with returning
Australian gold hunters from Melbourne to London, she was driven
into a big cave on one of the Auckland Islands. The swell of the tide
drove her main mast against the roof and forced the heel of it
through the hull. In this dark cavern raining great bowlders on
the sinking deck the terrified passengers and crew were forced to
take to the boats. Of the eighty-three souls on board only fifteen
succeeded in getting out of the cave of darkness on to the island.
After undergoing extraordinary hardships for nearly two years the
survivors were rescued.
V Several expeditions were at once fitted out to get the big store
â¢* of gold known to be on board the wrecked vessel in the cave. But the
cÂ» fate that swallowed up the Grant likewise threatened all these expe
â¦ ditions. The British Admiralty even sent a vessel to look over the
â¢Â£ ground with a view to recovering the treasure. And' now several of
i". the survivors and close friends of the survivors who worked on
% previous expeditions are here in San Francisco making ready for a
â¦ new trial under a new plan which they are confident will yield them
the chests of gold known to be in the hold of the wrecked vessel.

Rummaging in one of his pockets he found ',
a small box of wax matches. A quantity :
of kindling was soon collected and Teer
took the first match and rubbed it against ;
a stone. **-'-.'
It would not light; it was damp.
One after another was tried with the
same result, until only two remained, and
Tier had not the courage to light these.
Taking one. he placed it in his hair to dry
and gave the- other to the mate to do the
same. Teer now. went inland to see what
game could be procured or if any edible
plants could be discovered; but his efforts
were ire vain, and he returned in the even
ing weary, empty-handed and disheart
ened, but found the little band in a state .
of great- agitation. y.\^
The mate's match had struck.
''And where is the fire?" asked Teer,
sick at heart. â¢â  . â *
It seems that in the excitement of the
moment the match had been lit at some
distance from the dry material or had
dropped while burning the , lighter's
fingers. At any rate, there was no tire.
There was now only one match between
them and death! This Teer took from his
hair and examined carefully. It seemed
perfectly dry.. They collected the stumps
of the other matches, tore. them up Into
fine shreds and placed them under the dry
bark. Then a dramatic scene occurred.
The fifteen survivors, men from different
parts of the earth, all knelt down on the
sand, and prayed fervently to the Al
mighty to bless their last hope. Then
Teer. took the-- last match in his hand.
What the agony of that moment must
have, been we can imagine, for Teer,
strong man as he was, could scarcely by
the utmost effort of his will suppress the
painful trembling of his fingers. But the
crisis was on over. There was a steady
rub on a dry stein.-, a splutter of flame
. and then a thin blue streak of smoke
arose from the plied up fuel.
They were saved!
The fire thus lit was watched and tend
ed carefully day and night, each member
of the party keeping guard over it in turn
until the subsequent discovery of a flint
relieved the survivors forever of the
haunting fear of the fire going out.
Barely sufficient food was found during
the winter to keep life within the half
frozen bodies of the fifteen unfortunates.
A few seals were killed occasionally on
the shores of the creeks, when there was
a royal feast and the skins were kept
for clothing. These, with some stray

birds, and now and then some 1 fish caught
In the shallows, constituted at first their
only food: but subsequently, when they
had been nearly five months on. the island,
wild goats and hogs were discovered, and
from this time em wan! goats or hogs were
hunted down and trapped.
The terrible winter season at length
passed away' and the '. weary survivors
began to welcome the coming summer;
but so severe had been, their sufferings
and so little chance apparently remained
of their behi-r c rescued that they deter
mined to R)Bi.e one desperate attempt to
communicate with the nearest inhabited
countryâ Xew Zealand. One of the boats
was overhauled as well as their rude tools
would permit, and decked with sealskins
sewn together, sails were made of the
old sailcloth and provisions placed on
board.
When all was ready It was a question
of who was to go and how many were to
undertake the voyage. It was settled that
four would he enough, and these were,
selected by lot; but Brown, the first of
ficer, asserted his right to take his place
in the boat, and it only remained to select
three of their number. Amid the greatest
silence the lots were drawn, and William
Scott, Andrew Morrison and Peter Mc-
Niven drew the marked shells from the
bag. On January 22, 1867, these four brave
fellows, without any chart, compass or In
strument whatever, sailed away with the
desperate resolve of reaching the shores
of New Zealand, 400 miles away to the
northward. What the fate of these heroes
was we never knew, only that they were
never seen again by mortal eyes.
The summer passed and winter came
again with all its horrors. The severe
climate and scarcity of food began to tell
upon the health of the party. In August.
1867, David McLelland, aged 62 years, fell
ill and died the following month. The
number was now reduced to ten. Then
scurvy began to manifest itself and Teer
had to resort to the most vigorous meas
ures to rouse his fellow sufferers from
inaction, using brute force of a whip to
keep them on the move.
On November 10 a sail was sighted
a considerable distance out to sea
ami the usual signals were made, but in
vain; for the vessel passed on In a south
erly direction. On the Hist of the samu
month another vessel hove in sight, mak
_ng straight for Enderby Island, which
[proved to be the brig Amherst from Port
Bluff on a whaling voyage. She had not
been long at sea before one of the minia
ture vessels which had been sent out was
picked up and the fate of the General
Grant determined. Her captain then de
termined to search the Auckland Islands
for the survivors. One can readily im
agine the excitement among the cast
aways as the Amherst neared the island.
Teer. with three others, put off in their
only remaining boat and pulled madly for
the brig. "When Captain Gilroy saw these
strange beings clothed in skins and eight
een months' hair upon their heads and
faces, no wonder strong suspicions en
tered his mind that these persons might
be mutineers or madmen; and looking
toward the beach he beheld six others
dancing a franctic dance of glee around
their fire, which determined him not to
allow* Teer and his companions on board.
Poor Teer begged, prayed and expostu
lated, but Gilroy was not to be moved.
At last Teer obtained permission to go
alone on board and tell his story to the
captain. This he did. but so great was
the poor fellow's excitement that he could
not give a coherent account of himself or
his friends. Gilroy. believing that his sus
picions were not without ground, ordered
the distressed man back into his boat and
refused to hear another word.
At this moment an old negro was com
ing up on deck and heard Teer's last
words and the captain's order. Looking
toward Teer he uttered an exclamation
of surprise, for there stood one whom
he at once recognized as an old fellow
sailor. The old negro explained matters
to the captain and soon everything .was
settled all right. . * :;V. .
The next morning Captain Gilroy sent
his boats to bring off the remaining sur
vivors. They had been eighteen months
on the island.
Captain Gilroy and his crew lavished
every attention on the survivors and were
willing to abandon their whaling expe
dition to take them back to Australia,
but they would not hear of this and In
sisted on the whaling cruise being con
tinued, saying that as they had waited
eighteen months they could surely wait
a few months more. The Amherst then
headed for the south.
When the Amherst sailed Into Mel
bourne thousands of people lined the
wharves. Teer was presented by his fel
low survivors with a handsome diamond
ring, and the New Zealand Government,
so highly did they appreciate his noble
services, offered to j reimburse him
for all the treasure which he had lost.
This kindly offer was refused. . Teer said
he had only done his duty and if the
Government wished to do that for him
they 'must also do it for the. others, for
they had no distinction between them.
Several efforts made by different par
ties were unsuccessful in recovering the
treasure lost in the General Grant.
Steamers were chartered and divers sent
with them, but so severe were the gales
of wind in the locality that all attempts
were abandoned.
In all of these expeditions Teer was a
prominent figure, and in one actually vis
ited the scene of all his past sufferings.
He would never reveal at that time the
exact location of the scene of the wreck.
One expedition was entirely lost and
never heard of again.
- Even so recently as the year iss<_,
twenty-two years after the catastrophe,
Teer prepared for another great effort.
He laid all his plans carefully and every
thing seemed to favor the attempt. But
on the eve of the expedition, when the
final preparations were being made and
when It seemed that the gold in the ill
fated General Grant was at last within
reach, James Teer was found dead in his
hoi el In Melbourneâ dramatic end to a
dramatic life*
The treasure still remain where it went
down. The writer of this narrative was
the navigating officer of an English man
of war that was sent from Auckland in
1881 to investigate the wreck.

faith in the system as because Its adop

every stake. My standard stake was one
louis; If I lost Idouhlcd my stake, and so
on through the martingale up to the max
imum of 6000 francs. Now. almost every
day I was driven up to the maximum,
but then, as the sum 1 could win, sup
posing i was lucky, was too small to jus
tify the risk I had to run. I always got
the bank's consent to stake a higher sum
than the maximum, and bo staked VOOOf..
SOOOf. and 9000f. And on every occasion I
was fortunate enough to win the In
creased maximum, and for six days I re
tired from the rooms with a clear gain of
from Â£90 to Â£130. I staked on rouge et
noir only. but varied the position of
- my stake, according to my prearranged
system. which l now began to look upon
as having something in it. But T tri

then risked lOOOf. and won; I staked an

A lady who sat next to him and had
been watching his play for some days said
to him:
"You have stayed too long; you have
wearied your luck. Go away and come
back in a week; you will then be lucky
again."
He took the first part of her advice, but
not the second, for he did not go back.

Gambling Hells.
It was French sharpers or speculators
who, encouraged by the first gentleman
In Europe, the Prince of Wales, intro
duced gambling hells Into England at the
beginning of tills century. They Speedily
found English imitators, among them a
clergyman of the Church of England.
He had from his youth tip been a fre
quenter of French gaming houses, and
picked up a precarious living, until, by
introducing a London banker to a famous
courtesan over whom he (the parson) had
great influence, he secured from the bank
er a sum of Â£6000 in acceptances and Â£2000
in cash. With this capital, and the as
sistance of a few more kindred spirits,
who had money and faith in the parson's
business capacity, he established a "hell"

great eclat, but its success was not equal
to the anticipations of the speculators.
They committed a mistake from ovorcau

Crockford's Famous Hell.
On the northwest side of Temple Bar
here stood till 18651 an old house which
had for centuries been a fishmonger's
shop. 'After 1844 it had become a hair

and was pulled down in 1865, when thÂ«

John â¢ rockford carried on the business of
a fishmonger till the year 1827, when hav
ing made money by betting, he gave up
selling soles and salmon and went in for
catching fish, but confined his operations
to gudgeons and flat-fish." This is the
authors humorous* way of stating that
Mr. C rockford established a gaming
house, first in King street. St. James
afterward In Piccadilly, and finally In St
James street, where he erected a mag
nificent building, the fitting up of which
is said to have cost nearly Â£100,000 it
was known as Crockford's Club, and was
a gambling hell, the profits of which,
after paying all expenses, amounted
sometimes in one season to Â£150000
Hence we may infer that, as Mr. Ral'kes
wrote in 1535. the gaming was unparallel
ed. Defeated gamblers used to blackmail
Crockford by indicting him for keeping
a gambling house, and It cost him thou

morning rushed from Crockford's and
knocked a man. stooping on the pave

that for?' ' mildly inquired the man "I
was only tying my shoe." "Confound

Bets and Betting.
The desire to acquire money, not by
slow industry, but by short cuts to
wealth, is so strongly Implanted In human
nature that we may say it displayed itself
as soon as there was any private prop
erty, and hitting developed as soon as
there could be two opinions on any one
point. The first two young men who ever
met on this earthâ unless they were very
good young men. Indeed, the sort who die
earlyâ you may he sure held different
views on some pending event and backed
them by bets. Now, as long as they con
fined themselves to a friendly contest,
without any avaricious afterthought'
there was nothing particularly wrong in
it: it was a harmless amusement. But as
soon as the gambling elementâ the desire
to acquire some one else's propertyâen
tered into it. the practice became vitiated
and evil. And at the present day it is
nothing else. What do the thousands who
attend or bet on a race cart or know
about the breed and its improvement of
hori.es, which is the excuse made fo->
--racing? Not one farthing; their only ob
ject is to win money, especially in ouf
day, when the most unobservant may see
how powerful money is. not merely to
provide all the luxuries of life, but to
open aristocratic, aye, royal doors, to
even such Individuals as may have mean
and often enough shady antecedents only.
As long as hotting is confined to indif
ferent subjects, it may be Innocent in Its
character and harmless in its effects. Rut
sometimes betting assumes a perfectly
hideous aspect. About the middle of the
last century a form of betting came Into
vogue which was known as pitting one
man against anotherâ that Is. in plain
English, wagering which of the two will
die first. vv :â¢â â  - ;
Unpleasant Wagers.
In this manner people of the most op
posite characters. made up the subject of
a bet. A player perhaps was pitted
against a duke, or an alderman against
a bishop. There was scarce one remark
able person upon whose life there were
not many thousand pounds depending.
The various changes in the health of one
who was the subject of many bets we .i
anxiously watched by those Interested in
his life or death. As these bets were
matters of notoriety, it may easily he im
agined what effect they must have had
on the persons who were the subjects of
them. No doubt many a man's life was
actually shortened by his knowing that

the odds laid were very much against
him, for experience teaches us that the
moral condition reacts on the physical.
Very heavy odds were laid on the life of
a man with the constitution of a porter
when the person he was pitted against
was expected to die every week; this man
shot himself through the head, and the
knowing ones were taken in. Lord Stair,
when our Embassador to France, bet
that the King would not live beyond Sep
tember. He won his bet, for Louis XIV
died on September 1, 1715.
The practice was horrible, but have we

thing very similar to it in the insurance
of child life, which is simply a betting,
on the parents' part, as to how soon they

At. the; time of the last illness of George
IV, when the Duke of Clarence was in

Gambling Laws.
The English law, like that of every
State in our Union, recognizes betting as
an evil. and endeavors to suppress it.
But when evil examples are set in high
places, when an English Duke sets his
pride In being a crack hand in smashing
the pipe nose of an Aunt Sally and rend
ering the game fashionable, when a Prime
Minister's ambition is centered on having
his horse win the Derby, for which he
meets with more applause than if he had
rendered the most signal services to the
country, while thousands who have bet
on the wrong horse are plunged into
misery, is it to be wondered at that the
workingman always has money for bet
ting, while his family may lack neces
saries?that he can incur heavy expense
in the keep >>!' a racing or fighting dog,
which must have his fresh egg every
morning while his children must go with
out their breakfast? that he can forsake
his ordinary occupation for days to attend
races?
The sent writer knows a ship-build
ing yard in the North of England where
the work for a whole week was at a
standstill because all the workmen were
gone to the races held in the neighbor
hood. Of course, they lost not only the
wages they might have earned during
that week, but what money they. had liv
hand, which went into the pockets of the
rascally bookmakers, while the owner of
the yard sustained a heavy kiss by his
machinery being idle and unproductive
during all that time.
Betting destroys every finer feeling,
every regard for human or animal suf
fering. The bet is the thing, and to that
every consideration must yield. * It Is re
lated that at Crockford's a visitor to that
hell dropped down in a tit: some of the
bystanders thought him dead; immediate
ly bets were laid for and against this be
ing so. Some humane person proposed
sending for- a doctor to bleed him, but to
this the bettors objected, as that would
interfere with their bets.
Modern Passion for Betting.
In those days, however, betting was
confined to the '-upper suckles"; the plebs
had little to do with it. "But now every
ragged urchins' who sell newspapers or
errand boy has something "on. The
matches in the streets, the shoeblacks
who clean your boots, , are backers and
layers among themselves. The police re
ports daily remind us of the fact and of
its fatal consequences. Until recently,
indeed, betting was looked upon as "a
habit confined to the male sex. but now
even women Indulge in it, as they do in
the filthy habit of cigarette smoking. A
Miss Kenward of Birmingham, who has
long been engaged In endeavoring to
raise tha status of f-otorvuirls in the
Midlands, who ought to be in respectable
domestic service, has found the betting
prevalent among them one of the great
est difficulties she hag to contend with.
"One girl in her Sunday school classâ
what a satire this is on religious teaching!
âtold her with bravado that she had bet
8 to 1 on a horse and won two shillings.
'Tell her,' was the message received from
another, 'that any girl in our factory who
will not bet is despised.' "
In one factory a clerk regularly col
lected the pence from the girls which
they had laid on some horse and handed
over to the bookmaker. At another fac
tory the bookmaker stood outside as the
girls came out. to go to dinner and col
lected their pence. These "bookies," as
the girls call them, occasionally fail to
show up, yet the stupid girls will go on
trusting others.
In the Midlands and northern counties
there are female bookmakers, who, of
course, get easier access to women than
men, and even to children, who are thus
early initiated into courses which end In
ruin. Clandestine betting houses exist
in large numbers. Some years ago the
police were anxious to raid one particu
. lar house, but the keeper of Itâ it was a
beer shopâ was not tee be caught. One
day a funeral drew up at the door, and
the- undertaker's merry mon went In to
have a drink. Of course; they excited no
suspicion, but when they had seen as
much as they wanted to they threw off
their crapes and weepers and announced
themselves as detectives.
Gambling on the Stock Exchange.
When he reaches the Stock Exchange
"Rouge et Nolr" declares that Its morals
are pretty much on a par with its man
ners. El* holds that if brokers confined
themselves to legitimate business, viz..
the purchase, sale or transfer of stocks
there would not be much tee complain of.
"But these legitimate transactions are
comparatively so Infrequent that they
could easily be managed by one-tenth o'
the brokers belonging to the Stock Ex
change. So they encourage speculation
for the sake of the commission, which is.
In fact, their sheet anchor, though this
important Item, apparently insignificant,
is usually not taken into account by the
speculator. it generally is one-eighth
per cent, but as it is charged on the
whole amount of stock nominally bought,
It always comes to a sum which, at the
very start of. the transaction, nuts the
speculator at a disadvantage ; before he
can begin to think of a profit the stock
must have risen one-eighth to ever the
commission. Suppose he , buys 2000

_".; the stock must go up one-quarter per
cent to yield him a poor profit of Â£5.
Supposing he' carries over at the end of
the fortnight the contango has to be
added to the commission, so that the
speculation begins to look rather un
provable. But while he is slowly bleed
ing to death brokers and jobbers are fat
tening on his blood.
Seeing that brokers live and thrive by
the gambling frenzy which has smitten
the public, it is to their interest to foster
and encourage it, which they conscien
tiously do.
Woe to the client who listens to them!
cries this modern Jeremiah.
Ignorance of Brokers.
The brokers knowing no more than
the greenest outsider how stock will
moveâ if they, did they would make a
million or two in a fortnight and retire
âare as Incapable of giving reliable ad
vice as they are of predicting the weath
er for the next week, and therefore what
ever stock they recommend you to bull
or ; bear the best course the speculator
can adopt ls to do just the contrary.
For his guessâ and the brokers only
guess, or perhaps do worseâ may be just
as good as the broker's. * '..'-'
"A broker with whom I had many deal
ings once urged me to bear Claras, as in
Stock Exchange slang Caledonian Rail
way deferred ordinary stock Is called ;
'they are now at 108.' he said, 'they cannot
possibly go any higher, they must fall.'
I resisted for a long time, but eventually
yielded to his importunity, telling him
that it was entirely on his advice that I
entered into the speculation, and instruct
ed him to sell 5000 Claras. In the evening
I looked at the Standard, and found to my
disgust that they had that very day gone
up 3 per cent, so that I lost Â£150 by the
transaction. I also received a letter from
the broker, in which he coolly wrote, 'Of
course, we were wrong; but to-morrow
they must go back.'
"That 'we' was rich, and of course cal
culated to increase my serenity. I was at
the broker's office early in the morning,
and told him to close the stock, which,
while I was there, went down 1 per cent.
This reduced my loss to Â£100; I insisted
on his buying back the stock at that price,
though he kept urging that I was wrong.
And lucky it was for me that I so insist
ed, for the same day the stock rose to 112,
and eventually to 114, and remained at
that for some months, so that had I so
held on and carried over ,1 should have
' been a loser of thousands of pounds."
He lis another Story to explain his as
sertion that brokers, sometimes do worse
than merely guess. On one occasion one
of the fraternity induced him to Invest in
a certain American railway stock for a
rise which was sure to come. He showed
cablegrams which seemed to confirm that
expectation, bur in the end our author
was a heavy loser by the Investment, as
the stock continued to fall. in course of
time he accidentally discovered that the
cablegrams were bogus messages, and
that the stock he bad bought had be
longed to the broker, who induced him by
false pretenses to take it off his hands.
Company Promoters.
The Stock Exchange is bad enough, but
"Rot et X"ir" finds a deeper deep when
he reaches the theme of company pro-
moters. As a critic, according to Disraeli,
is a man who has failed in literature and
art, so a promoter, according to "Rouge et
Noir," is a man who has failed -in every
thing. As soon as his credit with all his
acquaintances Is exhausted he suddenly
blossoms forth in;,, a financier or com
pany promoter. Then he becomes the man
who is always in a. hurry, who tells you
that time is money, because it is about*
the only money that he possesses Of
course,- he has the gift of th. gab and no
end of cheek, and will tell the most bounc
ing lies with an assurance -which fills
those who .1., not know him with respect
and confidence. His object then is to pro
mote something. If he comes across any'
one who has a little money an! a com
mercial, industrial or artistic scheme in
which there is some promise, his course
is clear enough.
.. Th f_ hist thing Is to collar the money for
preliminary expenses": then, if he "hap
pens to know any person of a speculative
character who is likely to entertain such
/a. scheme, he puts it before him: if he de-
lines-, the promoterâ unless it is a big
thing, which holds out the prospect of a
very large haul Indeedâ takes no further
trouble, unless more money can *be
squeezed out of his anxious victim The
latter generally Is anxious and therefore
parts with his last shilling to the shark
who knows perfectly well that he has not
the slightest chance of floating the
scheme, and therefore has not the least
intention of making any further attempts
but coolly goes and has a lunch of
sausage and mashed potatoes at a cook
shop off the victim's last shilling
But when he thinks that a scheme is
likely to 'catch on." and that his new
client as he calls the confiding individual
who is taken in by his buncombe. is in
close connection with all the. city "big
pots -he Is not choice in his phraseology
:J" Jw e j â¢J?**, capitalists of London,
when this client happens to own a de
cent sum of money, and Is willing to part
with it for grand promises, the prelimi
nary expenses are at once extracted. To
inspire the victim with confidence the
promoter proposes at once to introduce
him to Mr. So-and-So, one of the biggest
men in the city: he takes him to the of
fices of some well-known capitalist, and
on pretense of going to see whether he
is in asks his client to wait in the lobby
while he goes into the clerks' offlce puts
some Indifferent question and rejoin, his
victim, saying that the capitalist has al
ready left the city for home, that, there
fore, the visit must he Postponed, which
in reality it is. sine die. But he talks bijr
about at once seeing other friends who
will form a syndicate. He really tries to
bring â  together a syndicate which shall
purchase the undertaking for a moderate
sum-supposing any sum is paid at allâ to
resell it to the public at a fancy price
When the scheme is the establishment of
a bank, a first-class hotel, a mining com
pany, a tramway or similar enterprise,
the promoter and some unscrupulous pro
fessional gentleman generally manage to
secure for themselves from Â£1000 to -l'!.
--000, and even more. The undertakings
thus promoted are in most cases wound
up In a short â¢ time, and the share
holders are left to lament their, credulity.
The promoter as a rule finds the direct
ors, whom he qualifies by giving them the
necessary number of shares "fully a
up." These directors must be men who
inspire confidence by either having ban
dies to their names or being known as
sharp business men, though in reality tne
subscribing. public know very little about
them, and . thus It comes to pass that
many titled men, made * unsubstantial
"guinea pigs" by being directors -of many
companies, realize handsome incomes hy
the mere fees paid to them as such, but
their names entrap the public.
â¢â¢Guinea Pig'-. Directors.
' The direction of companies has for
many years been quite a profession in
Itself. But .the practice: is of very old
date. From Parliamentary documents or
the year 1536 it appears from a list of
twenty-persons who acted as directors
i of companies, one was director of six, an
other of seven, a third of eight, a fourth
of nine, a fifth of ten, a sixth of eleven
and the others of two, three, four and
five companies individually. But the di
rectors of those days were but in a very
small way of business; it is now carried
on wholesale. According to the Dire -
tory of Directors for ISSB there are about
17,000 gentlemen acting in this capacity,
of whom about 3000 appear for the first
time this year.
Of course a great many of these direc
tors are mere "guinea pigs," dummies,
who are expected to vote as they ; are
directed by the chairman or the secre
tary, who as a rule is the only one who
is acquainted with business ana company
law.
Financial Papers.
The promoter of a higher standing de
pends much on advertising and puffing,
and the many so-called financial papers,
all struggling for existence, are ready
enough, for a consideration, to play into
the promoter's hands. Two-thirds of
those papers, some started by promoters
to puff the companies they have started
or are bribed to recommend, are puffers
or blackmailers, according to order. Their
proprietors will send around to the sec
retaries of newly formed companies and
promise a puffing "leader" to the com
pany, that. will advertise in their papers,
or hold out a threat of "wrecking" the
company if no advertisement is sent. And
they act up to promise or threat, and the
thoughtlessness or malice of the public
is so great that while they see through
the hollowness "of the "puff" they take
the abuse seriously, and thus these black
mailing papers often do much harm to a
really genuine enterprise.
"And talking of wrecking reminds me
that as there are wrecking newspapers,
there are lawyers who make company
wrecking their special business. Years
ago It was my misfortune to be connected
with a company with a large paid up cap
ital and the brightest prospects, which,
in consequence of political complications,
over which we had no contort, got into
difficulties. We decided to consult the
senior partner of the legal firm of Sell
& Grip, whom we had on a former occa
sion been referred to. We sent for him
and he came to a board meeting. We
began by telling him that, knowing his
great experience in company business and
law, we wished for his advice, to which
courteous speech from our chairman Mr.
Sell, with the utmost cynicism brutally
replied: 'Well, gentlemen', you have done
well, for If you had not asked me to be
for you I should have been against you;
I had my eye on you.' We managed after
that to pet what business we had to do
with the firm done through Mr. Grip, th*
junior partner, who was a very decent
fellow."
Monte Carlo.
When one sneaks of gambling, Monte
Cano naturally comes to mind. It is with
an air of relief j that "Rouge et Nolr"
turns from the wolves in sheep's cloth
ing who fatten on public credulity to the
genuine, honest wolves who scorn such
masquerading. He claims that as gamb
ling is not a legitimate pursuit either on
the side of the banker or the public, and
â¢ no one Is obliged to attend the gambling
table, as the gambler deals in a fancy
article which no one absolutely needs as
shoes are needed, he has a right to charge
and earn whatever commission or per
centage he chooses. Those who do not
like his terms are not obliged to deal with
him. and therefore they have neither a
â¦ right to complain of them nor to pre
scribe to him what they should be.
If there are allurements at Monte Carlo
he continues, no one is bound to yield to
them. No one is bound to visit the place;
it is a long way from Englandâ vet the
majority of visitors are Englishâ and so
â¢.ny one having started for the place has,
before reaching it. time for reflection and
repentance, and consequent change of
route. Let those whose means are lim
ited and who cannot resist temptation not
expose themselves to it by going to Monte
Carlo, as people who cannot skate should
not go on the ice.
In short, the Casino at Monte Carlo Is
not the. bugbear to the inhabitants of the
neighborhood that it Is to hysterical busy
bodies living thousands of miles away.
The Monagasques enjoy a most enviable
position; not only do they live amid the
most lovely climatic conditions, but no
tax gatherer, no rate collector ever dis
turbs their serenity. As they are not al
lowed to enter the Casino the gambling
does not affect them injuriously.
Advantages and Evils.
"The advantages the Casino confers on
the principality of Monaco are far greater
than the evils it causes. Land formerly

of Europe and America. Still, they are
unjust gains, says some moralist, who
perhaps here in England sits down to din
ner with a commercial swindler who lives
sumptuously in a pleasant mansion stand
ing in a fine park, while the victims ot
his frauds, specially invited by lying cir
culars, prospectuses, pamphlets and by
smooth tongued agents to intrust to him
their all, their provision for old age, or
for their children, are spending their last
days in" the dreary and prisonlike work
house, or are gone mad, or have com
mitted suicide on finding themselves,
ruined by a probably sanctimonious
scoundrel. Now Monte Carlo invites no
one and every one who gambles knows
at every throw what amount of risk he
incurs."
But one thing he cannot know, and that
is the character of 'the people who infest
the place. Of course, shady characters
shady, but not always known as suchâ
could not always be excluded from public
gambling rooms, and thus honest people
have. often been "done." One cf the
cleverest tricks ever played is related in
Sirvens Tripets d'AUemagne." A
Polish Count, who had lost heavily at
Homburg, and was uneasily wandering
from table to table and watching the
play, was accosted by an Individual, who
whispered to him, at tlie same time point
ing to the croupier turning the wheel "I
have an understanding with that croupier,
who can make the ball go into red at will;
when he takes -i pinch of - â :â â  and looks
at you stake 12,r00 francs on the md and
yen! will win. Give. me 8000 francs, half ',',.*
which I must give to the croupier the
rest is for yourself." The Pole followed
the advice and won, and handed 8000
francs to. the obliging stranger, who. on
the Count proposing to repeat the opera
tion, said: "No, not to-day; it might at
tract attention; wait until to-morrow."
On the following day the Count pre
sented himself at the table, watched the
croupier, saw him take snuff and look at
him;, whereupon he staked 12.000 francs on
the red and lost. He looked for yester
day's friend, but he never made his ap
pearance again. The fact was, his pre
tended understanding with the croupier
was a fraud; the croupier never had his
half of the 8000 francs, and the clever
swindler had walked off with the booty.
A Shady Gambler.
In the autumn of 1891 one Charles
Wells astonished the visitors at Monte
Carlo by his extraordinary success at
the tables. Interviewed by a Times cor
respondent, he declared that he played
according to a system invented by him
self, as nearly infallible as human in
genuity could make it. He won, indeed,
it is said. Â£30.000. But those who watch
ed his play could not detect anything
new in it; he simply played boldfv and
remained cool, whether he won of lost.
"All this had been don. thousands of
times before, but Mr. Wells was lucky
and won. He had a steam yacht mag
nificently fitted up, with ballroom and
music room and capable of accommodat
ing sixty guests. He staved at Monte
Carlo and Nice during the year 1892, and
gave lavish entertainments on board his
yacht, which were attended by all the
elite staying on the Riviera, arid the in
significant, common-looking little man,
vulgar in his speech and manner, was
made much of, for was he not supposed
to be enormously rich and to possess the
ring of King Solomon, by which he could
win wealth untold at Monte Carlo? How
the noblemen and gentlemen of high de
gree, the fashionable ladles of rank, who
all felt themselves honored in being ad
mitted to his yacht and his presence,
must have winced when they found, to
ward the end of 1892, that their idol had
been arrested at Havre for swindling in
France, and that shortly after he was
extradited to England, where, in Janu

Few people who have paid to witness
subjects of the so-called mesmeric trance
are aware that many ingenious impostors
have elected to make this fascinating
show their peculiar and profitable pro
fession.
Some of the traveling shows of this de
scription are nothing but clever frauds.
Two deep rogues put their heads togeth
er, the one posing as "professor" for the
time being, the other as "subject." The
show is extensively and attractively ad
vertised and on a day and hour appoint
ed, before a packed audience of gullible
provincial sightseers, who have each for
felted a fat fee for the privilege., the
subject is put to sleep by the professor
with many Impressive performances.
The subject sleeps for forty-eight hours
or longer, as advertised, during which he
is visited by some hundreds of people. A
medical man, who is called in to examine
the subject, gravely announces that he
Is in a "mesmeric trance." At the conclu
sion of the time stated, before another
curious crowd, he is "awakened" by the
plausible professor, after which the
crafty couple convey their show to an
other town. _ >.. .
From beginning to end the whole busi
ness is a fraud. The erstwhile "profes
sor" is no more a mesmerist than are any
of his audience. The "sleep" is assumed
and the "subject" is fed privately by his
companion in craft after the show closes
each evening. The "medical man" is
either a paid confederate or a dishonored
and poverty-stricken medico, who is
bribed for the purpose. Ample assurance
and a Stolid, stoical "subject" are the
stock in trade of this dubious business,
out of which pots of money have been
made by certain brazen adventurers
There has been any mount of discus
sion In the royal families of Hapsburg
as to the real birthplace of the late Em
press of Austria. It has been supposed
for many years that she was born In Pos
senhofen. Bavaria, and the genealogical
court calendar of Gotha has confirmed
this belief. The Bavarian Reichs-Herold,
however, stated in a recent number that
careful research showed that the Em
press Elizabeth was born in the ducal
palace in Munich on December 24; ISS7.
This was considered authentic by the
royal family, and. accordingly, the in
scription on the sarcophagus of the Em
press has been corrected. ._.."â.-..TSTRADIA again! Well, what

fâ\ Sandy Magee (the coach driver),
JL JL a bit grayer, a little more fur
rowed n_und the eyes, petted and
hustled and sworo and drove a four
h*>r?e team along the deep-rutted bush
track between Grafton and Solferino. We
were alone. 1 on the bos seat beside him.
Sandy and I coached that track once be
fore alone together, but we were going
the other way then, and I was pretty well
breiken up, and showed the raw red of
. h.*aling scars I shall always carry with
me- We crossed the old ford on the Clar
ence again, with the green island a few
yards from the bank, and the broad, flat
â¢' shelf of rock in the middle with a deep
A eir.-p into a dozen feet of water a few
Inches off the near wheels, Into which my
mate and I went headlongâ pack-horse
end allâ the first time we ever attempted
â¢t. By the way. we built the first punt
that over carried a dray across it in flood
timeâ a good punt; it floats to-dayâ and
we were driving quietly through old pad
nock., on the Yugilbarâ Ogilvie's. the very
gum trees of which were familiar. We
rincr-b-irked many an acre of those same
: paddocks, my mate and I, at a price
which was never paid us; but that doesn't
matter new. Presently we came to a dip
where the tr?ck led through heavy tim
ber down a gorge at the foot of the
ranges in which the Solferino diggings
â¢ lay.
"You remember Dago?" said Sandy,
. pointing with Iris whip to a little grass
â  grown heap of mullock about a dozen
yards from the track on our right.
"Do 1 remember Dago?" Yes, I remem
bered Dago well. My hand went Involun
tarily to a heavy scar on my chin. "That's
D.- r-^o. Sandy." said I, pointing to It.
â¢â¢Wellâ that's Dne-o â over there," nodded
! Sandy; with his head.
I looked round at the mullock heap, and
es I turned my companion flicked at a
blowfly on the off leader's rump, who,
.. Fiiddenly jumping forward, jerked the old
rattletrap of a coach half acrdes the
â¢ track.
"Whoa, mare! Whoa! Yes" Cos we
pwung into line again at a gallop), "that's
Dago! "Whoa, can't yer?"
But they'd all four got the fidgets, and
we flew along the next few hundred yards
ns if the devil was after us.
So that was Dago! It set me thinkingâ
wandering back to New South Wales
when I was a ladâ a lad on the tramp for
gold. Gold I couldn't win In coined sov
ereigns at home, but with hope in my
heart and the dreams of youth I set out
from my ship to dig from the hard earth
of a strar.se land.
And Sandy told mo his memories as we
drove through the silent bush. I told
Bandy mine in return; and some of the
lerrible minutes of our lives came back
to us both out of the past, and we lived
them over again.
I have had other memorable minutes.
but I don't remember so much being
crammed Into one of them as into that
cue which flashed back through our minds
when Sandy said, "You remember Dago?"
Yesi I remember the city of Grafton,
which now revels ln a bishop, a cathedral
and othf*r appliances of civilization, when
!t was only a straggling bush settlement
consisting of one accommodation house,
perhaps a dozen weatherboard shanties,
a forgo and a few tents dotted about at
.. irregular distances from one another on
cither side of one long, straight, grass
grown streat.
Hut Grafton was looked upon even in
those days as quite a "place"â for it
boasted an annual race meeting and a
.wharf on the river bank where once a
. fortnight the steamer from Sydney used
to callâ an occurrence of the greatest im

gathered regularly at the waterside to

denly sprang into Importance through be
ing the nearest point of debarkation for
the new gold rush that broke out at Sol-
ferino, a point ln the Yugilbar ranges,
seventy-five miles away.
It was a scorching hot day In the seven
th s that I. and my mate, a young Scotch
man who had passed for the army, and
who while waiting for his commission had
<enr.e out to Australia in the same ship
with myself, first set eyes in the place.
We landed, and the same evening left
for the diggings by the one long .strag
gling street which gradually dwindled
away Into a track, and soon lost Itself in
the depths of the primeval forest.
We steered northward by the compass.
Besides ourselves there were our dog, a
sh::mbling, long-legged yellow kangari-fo
bound we called "Jack," arid one pack
horseâa raw-boned Walerâ christened
"Rostnante."
mi-how or other we soon lost the
blaze-tree line â the only indication of a
way to the gold fields; but after many
hardships and mishaps we recovered the
track, made Solferino at last, pitched
camp, and then settled down to the life
of the diggings among some hundreds of
others attracted there I,;, tic- more or less
exaggerated reports of the rich "finds"
on the reefs. I still possess my miner's
right, which I treasure as a relic of past
days. â¢
There was little or no alluvial gold at
Solferino, however, the work being nearly
all reefing, and we at once started out to
W rospect, soon stumbling on a blow-up
gold-bearing quartz, and following it
down to a reef which we duly registered
n-t the "Don Juan." There were six of us
In It; my mate, the army officer; Sam
Devere, an Irishman and a barrister; Ab
""bott, a smart young fellow* who had been
â in the police: Harry Allen, a Royai
Academy of Music man from London who
played divinely on the fiddle and the
concertina; "Dago." a Spaniard, and my
self.
We picked up "Dago"â as we called
himâ not because we cared about him,
but because we wanted an extra man to
make tip the six necessary to apply for a
twelve-acre claim along the line of our
reof. and Dago was loafing around doing
nothing. That's how we roped him in.
He was rather a sullen chapâ dark, hand
some, with a black mustache, very white
teeth, and a trick of showing them when
he smiled, which wasn't often. He talked
a little English of a sort, not unspa
sprinkled with deities and "blg-big-D's,"
and he camped by himself about a quarter
of a mllo below the claim, on a bend of
the Yugilbar Creek, where he had put up
a log humpy, thatched with sheets of
stringy bark. I strolled down there one
Sunday, but he didn't make me welcome,
so I never went near him again. Dago,
my mate and I worked in the same shift
two of us down the hole and one on top
to wind up.
Dago and I had a difference of opinion
one night about a girl. It was Christ
mas and they had been having a
Jamboree in the camp ana some
dancing. The girlâ there were only
two altogether on the reefsâ me
a dance, and Dago didn't like it. So wa
quarreled. Dago and I, and he gave me
some' of his special brand of "English."
I slipped Into him and hurt him. ln the
middle of my forehead there is a Bearâ
you can see it nowâ where the haft of
Dago's knife caught me In the scrimmage!
There were gome words, but our mates
separated us and we went our ways. But
Dago was never friends after that, and
1 hated being down in the hole with him.
"Weeks wont by and I had forgotten all
about it. I thought Dago had tooâ but ho
hadn't; and this is what happened.
We had punk on the reef about 100 feet
when we came on water, which made so
fast that we couldn't work at the bot
tom of the shaft at all. There was noth
ing for it but to build a floor about thirty
feet up from the bottom, and work at
that level until the shaft below us was
filled up. Then we would all turn to and
bale out the water. So we got on. .
This floor was simply made of young
saplings with the bark left on, laid loosely
on a couple of cross-pieces, one at each
end of the shaft, which measured The
usual six feet by three feet.
The country we were going through was
as hard as iron and we could do nothing
with It with the gads and hammers, so
started blasting. It is necessary, in order
to understand properly what follows, for
me to describe our work and the way we
did it.
At the top of the shaft was a windlass,
by which one of us hauled up iron buckets
from below, while the other two tilled
them with stone and mullock as it was
broken out. The buckets simply hooked
on to an iron hook, which in turn was
spliced on to the end of a manlla rope
working round the windlass barrel.
It was our custom when the bucket was
full and hooked on to shake the rope.
Expert H. W. Wilson
ONE of the greatest of modern naval
experts, H. W. Wilson, has recent
ly been expressing his views with
regard to the possibility of sub
marine navigation. The submarine
boat, he does not hesitate to say, is sim
ply a freak of enthusiasts.
"It is easy enough," he writes, "with
the resources of modern engineering, to
build a boat which shall move about flush
with, or Just below the water. The diffi
culty is experienced in directing It. If
flush with the water the horizon is lim
ited, and an observer in the boat will
have his field of vision cut off by the
smallest wave. Below the water nothing
can be seen. It has been suggested that
the boat should be steered by a special
sounding apparatus on the bottom which
would automatically denote changes of
level. Yet, obviously, for this to be of
any use extremely accurate charts of the
bottom must be prepared, and this would
be a work of years. . Another defect of the
submarine Is her low speed."
The chief submarines now afloat or
building nre the Gustave Zede, belonging
to France; the Delflno, belonging to Italy,
and the Holland and Plunger, belonging
to the United States. The construction
and method of working the first two are
kept religiously secret. I have seen the
outside of the Delflno, but that told me
nothing. She was a red-painted, cigar
shaped craft of some size, and, when I
saw her, was lying in one of the Spezzia
basins. She appeared to have an armored
conning tower. I was told by an Italian
officer who was showing me the dockyard
that she Is a complete success In every
thing but steering. Her speed below the
surface is B*. knots.
The Gustave Zedc is one of the largest
submarines that have been constructed.
On the surface, with her rather tall con
ning tower projecting above the ' water,
she can steam or "mote." for her engines
are driven by accumulatorsâ knots. Un
der water she goes 8 knots. She carries
one torpedo tube and nine men. Service
on board is said to be both dangerous and
disagreeable. The fumes from her accu
mulators affect the health of her men,
and there have been curious . explosions
when the current was being run into her.
The Holland and Plunger are boats con
structed In the United States from the
drawings and designs of Mr. Holland' and
if they realize half what the inventor
claims for them should be exceedingly

effective vessels. The Plunger ls the larger
of the two and displaces 168 tons when
completely submerged. She has steam as
well as electric engines. On the surface,
using the former, she can cover sixteen
knots;. submerged, using her dynamos, she
can do ten knots. Like most submarines,
she is cigar-shaped. She has a funnel for
use with her boilers, which burn petro
leum, when cruising on' the surface.. The
funnel can be lowered Inside the boat with
great speeds and ease.
There is a conning tower protected by
six-inch nickel steel. ' Two torpedo tubes
are carried. The supply of .air for the
crew can be drawn through an India rub
ber tube connected with a float on the
surface of the water, or, If need be, can
be derived! from reservoirs of compressed
air carriedlln the hull. The boat is sub
merged either by pumping water ballast
into the tanks or by setting - vertical'
screws in motion, when she can be
dragged down or up. - A boat very similar
to the Plunger was designed thirty years
ago by Mr. Holland, and was intended to
attack our ironclads, but somehow or
other funds ran out and it was never
completed. '. ' yS'-l\-. Kf_
Mr. Wilson, as a practical naval archi
tect, has no mercy for the visionaries who
are always Inventing naval freaks. One
of the most extraordinary of these
fancies, he says, ls the circular ironclad
designed by the Russian admiral, Popoff,
which obtained front him the name Pop
offka. Two of these vessels were built for
coast service ln the shallow waters of the
Black Sea. Their names are Admiral
Popoff and Novgorod. Both are perfectly
circular on the water line, but have pro
tuberances at the stern underwater to
enable them to steer. The Novgorod's
diameter is 100 feet, the Popoff's 120. The
first has two 11-lnch breech-loaders In a
barbette In the center, of the ship, the
second two 12-inch guns -on disappearing
carriages. The Popoff ; has an Iron belt
running right round, 16 inches thick, tho
Novgorod one 9 Inches thick. Each. ship
is built with a forecastle to house her
crew. The Novgorod has six and the
Popoff four screws, but their speed is
miserable, not exceeding six ' or. seven
knots in flne weather. Moreover, they
proved very difficult to steer or handle,
which is just what we should expect. They
have done no service at sea, and never

where they are likely to remain until bro
ken up for old iron.
It is scarcely to be believed that so
ridiculously unseaworthy a type of ship
could ever find favor in England. Yet a
few years after these .naval abortions had
appeared a British admiral projected a
fearful and wonderful craft as his ideal
battlehlp. She was to Vie nearly cir
cular, to be driven by turbines, to displace
10,300 tons and to carry six 100-ton and ten
SO-ton guns, a modest battery, revolving
on two turntables. This is perhaps the
absurdest ship that was ever designed by
an inventor.
A less egregious freak is the curious
torpedo-ram Polyphemus, laid down at
Chatham In 1878. the first real ram to be
constructed. She is torpedo shaped, but
has a light superstructure built upon her
hull. This carries a number of turrets for
six-pounder guns, which resemble pepper
pots and give her altogether a very sin
gular appearance. She Is protected by
two and three Inch steel armor plating on
her curving sides and when sunk to battle
trim by means of ballast tanks lies prac
tically flush with the water. Her ram Is
very' strongly built, and projects twelve
feet from her stem. She has also five tor
pedo tubes, all submerged. In case she
receives Injuries which fill one or more'
of. her compartments she can expel her
water ballast and drop cast Iron ballast,
which Is attached to her keel in sections,
â¢to the total weight of 300 tons. Service in
her is not very comfortable, as her sea
men have to exist on what is known as
potted airâ that Is, air artificially pumped
Into the hull.
In battle she would be safe enough,
being thoroughly protected. She has seen
much service In the Mediterranean, where
she is now in commission. The Americans
have a not very successful copy of the
Polyphemus in their ram Katahdln, built
from Admiral Amnion's designs. She is a
ram pure and simple, having no torpedo
or heavy gun equipment. In general out
line she resembles the British ship, but
has a anierent shaped rain, chisel bladed
instead of pointed. She has also no su
perstructure, but has thickly armored
ventilating shafts, conning tower and
funnel base. Her speed is only sixteen
knots, as against the Polyphemus'^. 17.8
knots, and it is not very obvious how she
is going to overhaul the ships she intends
to ram. ....

"And then it is too late."
Then, whoever was at the windlass Im
mediately wound up, and when the bucket
reached the top emptied the contents into
a paddock and then sent it down below
again.
In the shaft we were obliged to blast,
as I said before. This was done by drill
ing holes In the rock, which were then
loaded with blasting powder, the fuse in
serted, and then the whole tamped down
hard and fired. The firing was done by
lighting a hit of candle over the flame of
which we bent the fuse. While the casing
of the fuse was burning through, who
ever flred the shot would have plenty of
time to put his foot in the hook, shake the
rope and be hoisted up out of danger.
Then off would go the blast, and when the
smoke cleared away we went down the
hole again and sent up the rock broken
out by the shot.
After we put in the sapling floor over
the water hole, we began to drive along
the face of the reef, and had worked In
about a foot, when my gold-mining days
were almost brought to a sudden stop.
My mate, the army man, had injured
his hand, and knocked off work for a spell
to get well. So Dago and I had to shift
for ourselves. It was my turn down the
hole, and I had succeeded after great
labor in putting in two shots about eigh
teen inches deep, one each side of the
shaft where we were driving. The labor
of this was terrific, as, being single
handed, I had to swing my hammerâ an
8-pounderâ one hand and turn my
drill with the other. However, I- got
through, loaded up the two holes, bent
my fuses over two pieces of candle which
I lit, and then shook the rope as the
signal to hoist away.
Just as I put my foot Into the hook,
however, I noticed one of the fuses had
buckled up with the heat and turned out
of the candle flame, so I stooped down to
bend It straight again. The casing of the
other fuse "glazed away merrily, and I
know that in a few seconds the fuse
Itself would catch. There was no time to
lose. I turned to grasp the rope, but it
was gone!
Looking up the shaft I saw It dis
appearing high above my head.
I shouted to Dago, out he didn't seem to
hear me.
The hiss of the fuses, which I had timed
for half a minute, attracted meâfascinat
ed mc. I remember looking helplessly at
them, and thinking I could, perhaps, drag
them out. ..:â¢'.:
I tried; but, no. I had tamped them in
so tight that they wouldn't budge. My
God! What was I to do?
Dropped Out of Sight.
THE past few weeks have been very
remarkable for the large number
of disappearances reported in the
newspapers. Within a very few
days two princes and a baronet
were declared to be "missing," and
there were at the same time several cases
in which less notable people were con
cerned. j y .; -Vy'
One of theseâ the disappearance of a
Chester governess- a striking re
semblance to a famous case which oc
curred in the middle of last century. A
domestic servant named Elizabeth Can
ning suddenly disappeared from her home
at Aldermanbury about 9 o'clock- on the
first night of 1753. There was not the
slightest clew to her whereabouts, and
every search made for her was in vain.
Special prayers were offered in churches
that the girl might return to her home.
Four weeks passed, and then, on January
29. hungry and half-clad, the girl knocked
at her mother's door. She told an amaz
ing story to the effect that she had been
carried off by gypsies to a lonely house,
where she had been starved and cruelly
treated by an old woman; and at length
two gypsies were arrested. They appeared
before Henry Fielding,' the novelist, who
was at. that time a magistrate at Bow-
Street, and were afterward sentenced at
the Old Baileyâ one to be hanged and the
other to be burned in the hand.
The Lord, Mayor was, however, by no
means satisfied as to the truth of the
girl's story, and caused fresh inquiries to
be set afoot. The whole town was moved,
and the people were split' up into "Can
ningltes" and "Gypsyites," just as France
is now divided over the Dreyfus case. It
created as much excitement throughout
the country as the borne case, and
ultimately â  the girl was tried at the Old
Bailey for perjury. The gypsies were set
: free, and after a trial of eight days, in
which ; thirty-seven witnesses on one side
contradicted twenty-seven on the other,
Elizabeth Canning was transported for
seven years. But nobody ever found out
where she had spent those four weeks. .
The ' disappearance of the Archduke
Johann of Austria is. perhaps, the
strangest story in the strange annals of
the Austrian court. There are those who
believe the Archduke to be alive to-day,
but his fate will probably remain a mys
tery. He married an opera singer in Lon-
Prom a photo by Lindt, Melbourne, Australia-
Bellew's "humpy" on the Solferino diggings, Australia. The barrel with
the net over it was used as a meat safe. On top of it is the wind tell-tale.
The hut was built by Bellew out of bark stripped from . the red gum trees.
The group in the foreground is examining a "prospect" washed in the pan.
The man next Bellew is Jack Abbott of the mounted police ln the diggings.
Bellew, In those days, was a sailor, had just gone into mining and called his
"humpy" the "Main Top," as the sign on the Iree shows.
There were about twenty seconds be
tween me and eternity!
I heard nothing but the infernal hissing
of the fuses; and it seemed to get louder
and louder.
Suddenly an idea struck me. If I could
climb up the shaft I might get above the
worst of the blast.
I put my back against one face of the
shaft and my feet against the other and
tried to work up that way. â /"'â .â¢.- â ..-.-..

feet above the level of the drive, when I

nephew of the reigning Emperor, and set
sail from Liverpool for South America. in
a ship which he bought and christened
after his wife.
The vessel was reported from Monte
video, but since that time nothing has
been either, heard or seen of the Arch
duke. He has disappeared Into space,
and though repeated searches have been
made by order of the Austrian Emepror
and the Hungarian Government, no news
has been received of his whereabouts
since, many years ago, his ship was seen
at Montevideo. His mother, who died not
long ago, believed at the time of her
death that her son was still alive. .'â 'â 
There have been several missing M.
P.'s. Sixteen years ago Mr. Powell, the
Conservative member for Malmesbury,
disappeared In a balloon. The ascent was
made in England, but neither balloon nor
balloonist were ever heard of again, and
it was assumed that both Were lost In the
sea. Mr. Douglas Pyne, at one time mem
ber for West Waterford, also disappeared
at sea. He was last seen alive on a
steam packet, crossing from Dublin to
Holyhead, and though a handbag and
some letters belonging to him were found
on board they were not claimed," and Mr.
Pyne was never seen again. .
Another member's "seat was once de
clared vacant because the member could
not be found, but happily he appeared in
time to stop the election. : ._ It will tÂ»e re

The circumstances surrounding the dis
appearance of Sir' Arthur Curtis, a Hamp
shire baronet, are very peculiar. He left
England with a gold mining party bound
for Klondike, and disappeared from the
camp after some trifling dispute, about
the. cooking. He left. the camp-on ioot,

floor of the shaft.
I heard the saplings crack, but the noise
was almost drowned by the awful hissing
of the fuses. As I scrambled to my feet
a sapling broke under me and my leg
went through the floor. *.
With an Inspiration I thought of the
well beneath.
Still that awful hissing!
I knew I had only a few seconds now
between me and utter annihilation. I tore
away at the saplings like a madman. My
God! how hard they had been jammed
down! I saw the water below me; the
bright light from the top of the shaft was
reflected irt It.
Was it my {ancy, or did I see Dago's
face, reflected there, or was it my own?
The water was about ten feet down be
low me. There was no time to hesitate.
The only chance of safety lay that way.
I made one wild plunge, and as I fell I
heard the splitting, hurtling, thundering
roar of the blasts as they both went off
above me; then I knew no more.
They told me it was days afterward
when I woke up. I was lying in my
humpy, conscious of great pain. My
head was all bound up; my left arm wad
strapped to a piece of wood, and I felt
awful.
Dago's girl was sitting on a wood-heap
in the big chimney of the humpy, heating
something over the fire.

By Marcel freVos'.
ABOUT the end the fifteenth century there lived in Sienna. Tus
cany, a painter named Baldassare Leanti. He was. a man of me
dium height, somewhat thickset, with an honest face, adorned by
a handsome thick black beard. His amber-colored eyes, with red
lashes, saw distinctly anything right under them; but in looking
at distant objects Baldassare had to pucker up his eyelids in a
fashion that gave him au appearance of timidity whenever he appeared In
puhlic.
Baldassare had as his art master the famous Matteo de Giovanni,
better known as Matteo of Sienna, ho was the best painter the Siennese
school had had since its deterioration began. The student meekly fol
lowed the advice arid adopted the methods of the master, whom he loved'
and admired. When Matteo died in Perugia. Baldassare still painted for
the churches, guilds and religious folk the same Virgin tiding the Divine
Child and the two praying angels. This is how he drew them. The mother
of Christ appeared with a slightly pointed oval face framed in a nun's
black veil clasped at her throat with a carbuncle; her hands, very thin and
white, held up the babe, whose little bald head was bathed in a halo.
DESTR UCTION OF KIRKSVILLE BY A TERRIBLE CYCLONE.
A TERRIFIC cyclone swept over sections of Missouri and low on
April Tt last. ICirk.-vllle and Newtown. Mo., suffered the greatest
damage. Over 500 families were rendered homeless, nearly sixty
dead bodies were picked up after the storm passe., l. besides 1550
injured persons, several of whom afterward died of their injuries.
Many bodies were not recovered on account of the fires that burst
out in many places among the ruins.
The tornado struck Kirksville when most of the residents were at
supper, cutting a clean path one mile long and 600 feet wide through the
residence section. A conservative estimate places the aggregate amount
of damage at 5200.000J the individual losses ranging from $100 to $8000.
The wind played many pranks and there were some miraculous escapes.

the J-'ainte- and Posed Patiently
The heavenly messengers worshiped to the right and left, long supple
necks i] porting tlieir empty looking and sad faces. The right-hand angel
clasped his slender fingers, while the one on the li ft held his arms crossed,
as though he were waiting for ihe sacrament. Sometimes, however, the
angel on the left clasped his hands and the one on the right crossed his
arm?. The Baldassare felt sure that he had made it new. departure in
the art of painting, and wondered with a little anxiety Whether his master
would have approved of If For ho put into his work the hesitancy of his
looks.
In his thirty- year he made an important and almost sudden de
termination. He married. I'ntil then he- had thought of women only as
the causes of idleness and dissipation, which have a taste of tho ashes of
Bin In one's mouth. And love's flames were kindling in him une day, when;
having gone to Rome for holy wick, he had seen the daughter fit Ins host
ess of the Oreo? glorious Pia, who had returned from' the convent in which
her mother had had her properly brought up.
Baldassare rc-euteved' thc m! walls of his dear Sienna a little before
Whitsuntide; married to Pia of the Orsp Strange tiioucb it be for a
quiet man who married somewhat late, he had no regret for what he had
done. Pia was as sensible as she was beautiful. Steady and domestic,
she did not chatter with the gossips <if thelneighborhboa^she looked at
no m,;n but her hush 11 she willingly accepted his caresses, for she loved
his reddish eyes, nnd th" black ringlets of his beard that gave him a look
cf sriirlt. The sole drawback of the marriage for the pood Baldassare
was that during the flt:.t months which followed it he did little painting.
Hardly could he seat himself at his easel before yawning seized him and
lie was comnellrd to succumb to irresistible slumber. Thi.-, prolonged in
dolence at last worried him. fcr the- artist's brush must not remain idle
ioo long if the household wgs to be kept alive. Fortunately. Palm Sun
(i...> had not come around again when Pia had a little son. â¢ * * " They
called him Matteo) aft<?r the great dead painter. In the interval before
the churching Baldassare picited lip his brushes again.' and the joy of his
art having reconquered him. he took to .painting with his old-time enthu
siasm. Not that he neglected his wife, but he treated her as a husband
should.
Several months passed. Summer heat lulled the lofty stone palaces,
the red churches, the well paved streets; autumn, with its light rains,
laid tlu? white dust of the roads: the year, ended, began again: the gentle
Tuscan winter, with its cool shades anfl delightful sunshine; brought back
the fire pot for the old women's numbed lingers. For three days Sienna
was mantled in snow the country; was full of white powdered olive trees
and crystal cypresses. * * * Then, ali at. once, in the newborn warmth
of the air. almond and quince trees bloomed. It was spring, hot as sum
mer. Bundles of black cherries clustered at the ends of the branches,
shaded with lance-shaped leaves. Piaahad weaned her boy. Since then
their home. The house was picked, up nd carried aero si slough and
and dumped up against a hill: the building was not completely wrecked,
and the- family escaped without anything worse than a severe shaking up.
Houses on both sides of the residence of \V. 11. Hull were blown into
splinters, but the wind v. -.- content with twisting his house off its founda
tions and leaving it Intact. The house; was in the center of the district
and it was used as a hospital after .'.'â¢ storm. ' - ,;
P. J. Rieger. a prominent attorney, ran right Into the path of the
storm to save his family, who were helpless with fear. Dashing into the
house In carried his wife and children into the cellar. As he stumbled
Into the place of safety the building was leveled to thi ground.
The dwelling of Judge Andrew Ellison was stripped of its second
story. He and his family and John Dogheny look refuge in the cellar and
were saved. The residence of H. Lowell, just outside of town, was twisted
into a heap of ruins and three of his children killed and burned in the
Photographs TaK^D Specially for the Sunday Call.
The Virgin of the Cherries
the had grown silent; her beautiful face, with its perfectly regular fea
tures, was overcast. Her jet black eyes dreamed too much. She was sad.
When -Baldassare went to her after his day's work he found her sitting
unoccupied, beside the sleeping child, an absent look in her face and a
frown on her brow. He questioned her. She replied. sadly, without anger,
"Nothing is the matter." Sometimes, too, she threw her arms about his
neck and covered his face. with kisses.
Ope day In the same spring Baldassare was finishing the thin outline
of the right-hand angel when Pia and her child came into his studio. She
sat down by the easel, amusing little Matteo with a bunch of cherries.
Baldassare smiled at the two beings, whom he cherished, and went em
tainting. i'la was quiet, but as th< little one, excited by grasping the fruit
n ids untaught hands, crowed and laughed with glee, the father stopped
his work, amused himself a moment by watching him, and said:
"Now, i'la, leave me In peace. This picture that I am finishing is an
urgent order, and the Countess Volumli, to whom I have promised it for
Sunday, will give me more lor it if 1 let her have it on Saturday."
Pia rose, carrying the child..
"We don't prevent you from painting." she said, in a pouting tone.
"Yes, you do. i watch you both. 1 see the little one's charm and your
beauty, fia. * * . * That disturbs me. I no longer feel the necessary
calm and piety." * * s *: t, 'â¢.>>' \
Pia cast down her black eyes, which was her way of showing her dis
pleasure. â â â â â '.â ' : .--.lf: *
"It is true.." she said, "thai Matteo and 1 look little like what you are
painting on your canvas." "".-.'
Baldassare laid down his brushes. . - -
"What do you mean. Pia?"
"1 mean," she said, becoming animated and going nearer to the pic
ture, "that the Virgin I see there is not a woman, that the Jesus is not a
real child, any more than the two angels are actual youths: Where have
you seen such thin necks, bent like reeds, such tig-shaped faces, such lin
gers as long as spiders' legs? I don't understand the art of painting, but
to my mind the clumsy sketches that children make with charcoal on
white' walls are more, true to life." . --'.-.'
Baldassare did not get angry. He thought for a second, then,
looking in turn at the picture and his wife: 'ti *- â -'-.
"Pia." he said. "i drew this Virgin, this infant Jesus and these angels
as I was taught by my dear master, Matteo di Giovanni, who how is face
to face with the angels, the Virgin and Jesus in paradise, and can tell
whether the pictures he made of them look like them.* Not having seen
them myself. 1 follow the tradition. Still, what you say troubles me a
little because. I don't know but that there Is some truth in it. I must
think about it. Leave me, please, and don't be. angry with me, because I
love you and am grateful to you for having spoken from your heart."
For the rest of the day he could not resume his work. He first t nought
of his painting and then of his wife, and for the first time he thought of
both with uneasiness. By dint of thinking he ended by distinguishing
things clearly. - For he used his mind as conscientiously as his eyes, and,
Just like his eves, his mind, usually distracted, perceived things distinctly
when hi brought it to bear on them at short range. Baldassare under
stood two things. The first was that Pia was jealous and hated the time
that her husband devoted to painting. Perhaps sin- was not wrong. win-n
--ever he was painting Baldassan forgot Pia. But. having taken her for his
wife, be should have associated her with that noblest part of his life which
gave him so many hours of peaceful labor and pious enthusiasm. On the
contrary, he had banished her from his artistic life. Like most of his con
traries, woman seemed to him an object of gratification for the senses
of man, not a companion for his thought.
The second thing that Baldassare understood was that Pia, in criti
cizing the Virgin, the child and the two angels, had not talked nonsense.
Matteo of Sienna, of course, was a great master, and one could imitate
him indefinitely without fear of error. - -* :
But. strictly speaking. Pia was right. The V.ir_rin Mary and Christ,
during their happy time on earth, were beings of flesh and bone-. As to
the angels, tradition depicts them as beautiful youths provided with wings.
Baldassare, like Matteo. of course, did not paint beings of flesh and bones
in order to interpret th" superhuman character of the sacred personages.
If, however, "re had a faithful portrait of Jesus and of his mother such
as they were, with all the signs of their humanity, with what joyous ven
eration would not such a nortrait be greeted! . 'Vv ....
Baldassare pondered over these great problems all day long and during
part of the following night, while Pia slept restlessly a- his side. Next
morn'ng. when be awoke, he had made a resolution. ** -. '-.."*-'

Nine Great Tribes That Inhabit the Philippines.
BESIDES the Europeans. Chinese and
half-castes, or "Mestizos." the pop
ulation of the Philippines is made
up of nine different tribes, or rather
peoples, representing at least three
; . distinct races and differing form
each other in many essential character
istics. With the exception of the Moors
of the Sulu archipelago and the southern
part of Mindanao, the natives are of Ma
lay origin. The Visayas; Palawan. Min
danao and other islands in the south, be
sides tin; Moors already mentioned and a
few "Negritos, " are peopled entirely by
the Visayas, or Btscayas, who number in
all nearly 3,000,000, or about one-third of
the total population of the Philippines.
Of the seven tribes found on the Island
of Luzon, the Tagals are the dominant,
race. Their numbers, now about 2.000,000,
are increasing, as much by assimilation
of other tribes as by the excess of births
over deaths. They occupy the very best
parts of Luzon, from the southern to the
extreme northern end. and Mlndoro, Ma
randiguc and other adjacent isles have
also been "Tagallzed."
After the Tagals the Negritos, though
fcw*cst in number, are the most interest
ing people In the Philippines. They are
the aborigines, and like the Amos of Ja
pan have been driven back from the coast
and low country by the steady aggres
sions of the Malay Invaders. They have
disappeared from some of tin islands al
together, but there are few sections of
the population that do not show evidences
of the infusion of negrito blood. In all the

Among the horrors of the storm was the finding of the corpse of a 16
--year-old girl with a 2x4 scantling driven through her body. The body of a
little child was found with the limb of a tree sticking through Its neck. A
citizen was found after the storm standing over the body of his dead
wife. The head bad been crushed and severed from the body.
The scenes of the rescuers were horrifying. An aged man and his wife
had evidently been eating their evening meal when the cyclone struck and
carried their home away. They had clasped each other in their arms and
were found dead on the ground some distance away from where their
home had been. No trace of their house has been left. Several of the
dead were found In spots which would have been the center of the house

Fortunately little Matteo was a good child and Pia had the serene good
nature common in Roman women, for long sittings were necessary, ana
for many days Baldassare exercised extreme care. It was so many years
since he had worked from life. His hand grew tired in drawing the lines
of the model: his palette had forgotten the secret of the colors of real tire.
Yet alter many failures and new attempts, one day he. felt he had suc

praise his work without cause. The painting, celebrated Sienna even
before it w-as finished, was christened "The Virgin With the Cherries,
and the name was given to Pia herself, who took pride in It.
"'â 'y ; Paldassare became pensive and finished his picture in great reh

In general the Philippine Malays re
semble those of- Indonesia; but in Luzon
there is a visible leaning toward the Chi
nese type. The almond eye. rare among
the southern Malays, is a distinctive fea
ture of those of the northern islands.
The Luzonese are broadly grouped in
two classes, according to their religion
and pursuits. Those who have accepted
tin authority of the whites and the min
istrations of the Catholic church are
called â¢'lndies." and the very slow purg-
Ing of the several tribes of this class is
the' only promise of a common nationality.
The tribes that have maintained their In
dependence, or submitted but Impatiently
to th.-- Spanish yoke, and still practice
their old pagan rites, form the class of
"Infieles." i
Of the Indies the most civilized are th*
Tagals, and after them come the Iloca
nos, Cagayahs ami others of the upper
part of the island and the Vicols, some
600.000 in number, of the southwestern
part. The pagan population, often con
founded by tie- Spaniards under the gen
eral name of Igarrotos, still form a large
section of the population, both in Luzon
and Mindanao. The Igarrotos, properly so
called, consist of a number of tribes who
occupy a large part, of the basin of the
Cagayan River. They mostly appear to
be Tagals, who still preserve their primi
tive religion and customs. Hereditary
feuds and head-hunting prevail among
them.

Women have had all kinds of pets from
time Immemorial, but perhaps the strang
est of all fancies in this direction is the
latest news which comes to us from Paris
that two ladies have succeeded in taming
dozens of butterflies.
These little insects eat fro- their mis
tresses' hands, alight on them and show
no fear of any kind. They are certainly
pretty, pets, and well become the airy,
fluttering sweetness of the typical
woman's nature.

the week, from Monday morning until

AMONG those whom a thirst for

from localities where they could be

field, he bought fifty head of steers and
thirty head of horses near Edmonton
and outfitted with several tons of pro
visions, which were to be hauled on
sleighs by the oxen.
With two or three helpers these men
started on their long journey of over
2100 eventful miles about the middle of
February, IS9B. They took the trail
leading to Athabasca Landing, thence
up the Athabasca and Little Slave
rivers to Lesser Slave Lake, a distance
from Edmonton of 300 miles.
It was while resting our horses at
this post that we first saw them, with
their long string of yoked oxen, slowly,
patiently hauling their loads. They did
not appear to strain, but by reason of
theii ponderous weight alone the sleigh
followed their slow, deliberate steps.
The men were weary when they
reached this point. For a month they
had bsen up at 4 a. m. to feed their
stock and were in a state of constant
activity until long after dark. During
the day they traveled continuously,
never stopping at noon for lunch, but
eating their hardtack as they walked.

WHY I BELIEVE IN IMMORTALITY.
REV. E. E. HALE, Unitarian.
Boston, Mass,
'\_~ i ASTER morning does not prove man's Immortality, It asserts lt.
j-**** 3 In the universal resurrection from the night of winter, as life re
ll . turns which has been sleeping or shrouded, lt asserts man's com
munion and companionship with the God who ls Life, and declares
that man who is child of God cannot die. Christ takes from first to last
the ground that as he is the Son of God we are God's sons and daughters,
sharing the infinite life; that they who truly live can never die. "Be
cause I live ye -hall live also."
The great event of history is in the great miracle of lifeâ victory
of life over death. It is ours to enter into the victory. Christ not only
comes that men may have life, but that they may have it more abun
dantly; he makes their life so large and full that they know it does not
end with the physical accident of death. ' ' â¢ ' '
"It is a little thing in comparison to believe in Immortality. The
great thing Is to live as an Immortal."'. How does the surety of eternity
affect daily life? The lesson of Easter' for you and me will be learned
if we covenant anew to-day to live the .life of the living children of _
living God.
Marvels of
Indian Fakers
INDIA Is pre-eminently the land of
mystery, and our most advanced
magicians have never been able to
reproduce all their marvelous per
formances. One day in the market
place of an Inland village I saw a
curious performance. It was conducted
by two menâ one old and emaciated, car
rying a native drum; the other young and
well fed, fantastically gowned with an
overskirt of colored handkerchiefs and a
multitude of bells, which Jangled noisily
at his slightest movement; long, ragged
hairâ altogether a hideous figure.
The drummer began a weird tom-tom
ing/ and the other man an incantation.
Then he extended a "supra"â a bamboo
tray used by all nativesâ on which any'
one who pleases places a large handful of
rice . ie! the same quantity of grain. The
two ingredients are thoroughly amalgam
progress one of the party
responded cheerfully:
"Oh, we get along very
well. Some days we make
as high as ten or twelve
miles."
The usual daily average
for prospectors with horses
was from twenty to twenty
five tiles. ffi_2BÃ
The drivers did not stop at
the post stations. Rest was not _
considered in their schedule.
Through a blinding blizzard they
started over the eighty-six miles of â
deep snow trail to Peace River "
Landing. We soon came up with
them and worried along behind them
for a half-day before getting an op
portunity to pass. As every man had
several loads to look after delays were
frequent and protracted, during which
times the shouting of the drovers was
mingled with the imprecations of the
impatient trailers behind, At night
they beat a side path in the deep snow
and pulled out of the main trail to al
low us to pass.
Then began the long journey of 200
miles up Peace River on the Ice to Fort
St. John at the dangerous time just
before the spring break-up. To reach
this point parties traveled during the
night, when the ice was not softened
by the sun. One by one the parties
pulled off the river at the trading post
to recuperate for the pack trail or wait
for the clearing of the river to proceed
farther by boat. Each party as they
came in told of the progress of the
bulls. They were coming slowly. The
oxen were continually breaking
through the honeycombed ice, but in
most cases were pulled out of the cur
rent after infinite difficulty. They la
bored on, and after all others had left
the river finally crossed on the narrow
neck of ice still remaining, and pulled
up the steep, bare, gravel river bank
to land.
This was fated to Mr. Lang's last
drive. Arriving at St. John, he was
taken ill. For a time he was nursed in
the trader's house, but continued to
grow worse. As soon as the river was
ated, so that' it would in the ordinary way- i
take- hours to separate them.
Now the fantastic man with his tray be
gins. He turns around slowly, gradually

THE answer to this question must vary with the answerer. The
Christian believer would be content to say with St. Paul, I believe in
it because "Jesus Christ has brought life and immortality to light
.through the gospel." Lord Tennyson said, none too strongly, "The
cardinal point of Christianity Is the. life after. death." And some one else
has well said,. "Death is not the end, but only an event of life." The
Christian belief has the double sanction, first of our Lord's acceptance of
the immortality of the soul as an axiom of humanity; and then of his ful
fillment of the old instinct by the revelation of the eternal life of the
entire man. the glorified immortal soul in a glorified Immortal body. "I
believe in the resurrection of 'hi body; l look for .the resurrection of the
dead, and the life of the world to comÂ«."
Before this and behind it belief in immortality Is the instinct of the
human race. It is demanded alike by the analogies of nature and the
logic of nil true philosophy. Any theory of existence. which omits a belief
in immortality makes of life a mere chaos of uncompleted undertakings,'
unsatisfied desires, unrealized aspirations, unrewarded service, and un
rlghted wrongs.' It reduces the human soul to a lower materialism than
that of the Imperishable atoms of matter which science recognizes as in
destructible and continuous, although subject .to perpetual change.

WHAT I regard as the modern scientific argument for Immortality
is given at length in "The Theology of an Evolutionist." All
that I can do In answer to your Inquiry is to state briefly here
the conclusion there reached. I do not see how one, can be a
consistent evolutionist and think that "death ends all." When one be
lieves that the whole process of the long evolution has been for the pur
pose of producing a thinking, willing, loving man, how can he believe
that the end of it all isâ nothing? From the first nebulous days God had

when the body is gone, all evolution ends In a cul-de-sac.

THE scriptural textâ "l am N the Way, the Truth, and the Life"â
means this: The "I Am." self-existent infinite God, is Truth and
Life. The "way," through Christ, is Divine Science; not death,
but the understanding of Life, makes man immortal. The lost
likeness is not man. But Science reveals man as God's likeness, that

COME, boys, let's go out and get

That's what Captain Varney
of the Golden Gate life-saving
station said to his crew last
"Wednesday when he wanted them to
to go out and drill in the surf. And
he could have described th-- expression
no better, for the men were as wet as
drowned rats before they got through
maneuvering the lifeboat in the break

There is a lifeboat drill once a week
out on the Cliff House beach, the day
depending on the weather. If a fine
day comes early in the week the drill
takes place then. Should the weather
prove unfavorable early in the week
the drill is put off until a fine day
comes along.
It might appear at first thought that
it would be best to drill in bad weather

so that the men could get accustomed
to rough water. But this is not so, for
the lifeboat drill is not a mere amuse
ment; it is an exercise calling for both
courage and- nerve and at all times
accompanied by considerable danger.
In rough weather, no matter how
much care is exercised, there is likely
to be an accident to some of the gear,
even though the men sh -uid be so
lucky as to escape. An hour afterward
there might be a call for help and
with a broken boat on hand tin life
savers would be unable to pond.
That is the reason that no drill takes
place in rough weather. Besides, the
water is always rough enough for all
purposes. Just watch the lifeboat and
see.
After the order is given to drill there
is a hurrying of men from distant
parts of the station. They rush into

dinary garments and get into suits of
thin white duck. For shoes they put
on cloth slippers with rubber soles.
"When we go through our drill
here." said Captain Varney, "we go at
ii jo- the same as if there was a boat
in distress out in the breakers. Not. a
second of time is lost and every move
Is as exact as possible, so that each
man becomes thoroughly familiar with
his work and never makes a mistake."
"Man the lifeboat," calls out the
cockswain, and the drill has com
menced.
In less than ten seconds from the
time the order is given the canvas cov
ering is stripped from the boat and It
is rolled out in front of the house.
Then at the word of command every
man jumps to his place, seizes a rope
and all start for the beach on the run.
It is .an almost grotesque sight to
see the big boat mounted on-: wheels
Hying over the sand. The men drag
it as if it were a toy, although it
weighs over two tons. Down the
randy beach they fly and plunge right
into the breakers, The idea is to get
the beat into as deep water as possi
ble, so that it may the more quickly
be sent out into the breakers.
By this time the men are all wring
ing wet, but each quickly seizes a life
preserver from the boat and buckles
it on.
: Then the boat is pushed from the
wagon, or truck, and each man takes
his place at the sides, except the cock
swain, who stands in the stern with
a long oar ready' to steer the instant
deep water is reached. "-.
One or two small. swells come in and
the boat is pushed out a little further
each time. Then a big roller comes
along. It buries the boat in foam, but
lifts it high from the beach.
Just at this instant the men jump
in and take their places at the oars.
Before the inrushing tide has had a
chance to recede half a dozen mighty
strokes have; taken -the boat far from
land and out into the big, rolling
breakers.
While the lifeboat was on land it
looked like a big. cumbersome hulk.
But out in the surf it becomes a thing
of life and rides each roller with the
grace- of. a swan.
There are usually four lines of break
ers on the beach â¢â¢ and ! to' get past' each
of these is a' mighty- task: The mcc

but even then progress is very slow.
. After rising over the first incoming
breaker the lifeboat plunges into the
depths beyond so deep as to disappear
from sight. Then she rises high into
the air, hanging on to the crest of a
wave for a moment, slues around
and goes down the next roller at an
angle.
Steersmen and rowers now pull as
if for dear life. The boat almost swings
around to take the next wave on her
bow. but does not make it. The crest
of the wave breaks on her quarter, half
filling the boat with brine and Con
cealing it from view in a mountain of
foam.
But nothing daunted the sturdy life
savers pull; for the last breaker. A
dozen small seas all come in at once.
The lifeboat is pitched around like a
cork. Up and down and round and
round, rolling first on one side and
then on the other. Waves break on all
sides and foam rises to the gunwale.
But here comes the last breaker.
Steady now. The steersman hangs
tightly to his oar, and turns the .boat
to just the right angle. Then the wave
comes and she takes it just right.
Raising her bows high in the air she
poises an instant. Then her stern. rises
and she plunges down into the trough
of the sea. The lifeboat â Is now out
In the ocean, and if there was a ship
in distress out there it would be an
easy matter to get aboard of it and
rescue the imperiled crew.
Out in deep water the drill is con
fined to the art of handling the boat.
Big rollers have no terrors- for the life
boat. She rides them in all directions
and even lies In' the trough of the sea,
where an ordinary, craft would perish.
This exeftSSe also consists of pulling
men out of the water and righting and
bailing the boat after upsetting it. The
lifeboat's crew seem like a flock of sea
gulls so much are they at home irt the
water. Their boat will toss about bot
tom side up for several moments when
they will ail get around and turn it
over and climb in.
To "get back to land is not difficult,
but it Is more dangerous than going
out. In this instance the aim is to
check the speed of the boat, for other
wise' she would be hurled on the beach
as If fired from a cannon. This danger
is overcome by throwing out a drag
that holds the boat back. Then it is
only necessary to steer properly and in
a few minutes there is a bump on the
beach. Instantly the men jump out and
like a flash drag the boat back to shal
low water. The drill is now over.X^^a^^/ _____ .^-x^ the Library. â¦â¦â¦â¦

CURSED FROM THE CRADLE
REMARKABE LIVES OF TWO OAKLAND BOYS
TWENTY-TWO years ago a happy
little maiden living on a farm
n.ar Council Bluffs left her home
against her parents' desire and
married a dashing young Metho
dist evangelist, who was also a
lawyer. After an experience
which no romancer dare- risk his repu
tation in attempting to parallel, this once
happy girl is now- the unhapplest mother
in all the. Land â one of her boys await
ing the forfeiture of his life on the gal
lows: the other killed by a Sheriff while
following a bandit's life. â¢
Lucirida Wehr, now known to ail the
world as the mother of the boy bandits
who recently committed murder and
other crimes in Ftah. was when a girl
one of the most devout attendant at
the little church -near her home. While
following devoutly the practice of . her
simple rclicrion she met Lloyd Majors,
then a ypung man of good address, strong
intellect and advanced cducatfon. ' He
was one of the pillars of this little church,
and was known inâWi' iTTsTrleT" 'around
Council Bluffs as an enthusiastic evange
list from whom great things were ex
pected. It was often prophesied that
Lloyd Majors wouid be ' a name as well
known as that of Moody before he died.
This prophecy was fulfilled, but in a man
ner just the revrsc from that which his
follow, ts had hoped.
Very naturally. Lucinda fell In love
with the young evangelist: He was more
than twice h.r age; hut all the reasoning
of her parents could not induce her to
.vase accepting Majors' attentions. and
tit-- first unhappy step in her career was
her hasty marriage to this very religious
man.
Majors was a graduate of Ann Arbor
University and had qualified as a lawyer.
After his marriage he came to '"allfornia
and in the Centennial year settled at San
Jose. He at once attracted attention to
himself, partly on account of the win
ning ways of his girl wife and partly be
cause- of his own intellectual power>.
Majors, for that was the way he .'lied
bis name on rrlvlns it San Jose, was
then about X, years old, and is described
by a friend as "a big ungainly man, awk
ward in manner, having a dark, stern,
forbidding expression.
Majors and his wife lived on the. beauti
ful Alameda, where Majors opened a
business as a carpenter and wagon maker,
being proficient in these lines. Hi was
ambitious and soon started out to make
a career-in other lines than those of work
ing with his hands. IB- won his way into
the friendship of several. lawyers, and met
some who graduated from his alma mater
in Michigan. He also enlarged his circle
of friends by Joining the Methodist'
church and taking .a prominent" part Ine

of fires, from which he always .collected,
the â  â  . but no ope thought, of
breathing a wonPJbf suspicion against the
religious carpenter-lawyer. To the sur
prise of ever.vbftdy he ; declared after a
few years â¢ these fires had broken
him up in business, nd be left San! Jose
to settle in Les Gatos. .' .
Two beautiful little children, were born
to them at Los Gatosâ Archie and Abeâ
and it was noticeable that Majors showed
the most remarkable and genuine affec
tion for his children.- He would play with
them for hours, guide their childish in
stincts and always prophesied that Archie
rbould be a lawyer and Abe a minister.
Â» * . *â¢
,-. At Los Gates a change came over the
attitude of Majors toward religion. He,
as usual, joined the bun but could not
take a very active part, being handicapped
in his progress by opening a hotel with -a
bar attached. This*brought him into dis
favor with the church, and ; as the step
from a hotel with a saloon to a saloon
without th" hotel was easy Majors soon
took it and became known as a common

In the mountains near Los Gatos lived.
when Majors opened his mill, an old
woodsman named William Renowden. He
owned 200 acres on the mountain side,
lived â¢ii a cabin, was something of a re
cluse and was supposed to have consid
erable money hidden away, His cabin
stood far up among â¢ be hills, and from its
door a picture of Incomparable beauty
stretched away below. It was one of the
most seductive spots in Santa Clara
County. This recluse had but one friend,

eer, a Scotchmanâ agile, strong, fine look
ing and known far and wide.
One morning In March, 1883, the village
of Los Gatos was roused by a messen
ger from the mountains, who brought the
news that old Benowden and young Mc-
Intyrt had been murdered and their cabin
destroyed by fire.
A mountaineer first brought the news
to town. He lived some miles away from
Kcnowden's cabin, but had seen the light
of it: burning. He hurried to the cabin,
and seeing that he could do nothing
turned back. At daylight he again went
to the cabin and among the ashes, but
little Injured by fire, was the corpse of
Renowden pierced by two bullet holes.
Another search among the ruins revealed
something of the trunk of another human
being. It was only a portion of the lungs
and the upper portion of the heart. They
were carefully preserved and ultimately
helped to fix the crime on the murderer.
For two or three days no clue to the
origin of the tragedy could be found, but
it was soon noticed that two men who
had figured quite conspicuously in the life
of the community were missing They
were John Showers, a big-boned, brutal
fellow, and Joseph Jewell, a gentleman, a
scholar, an artist and a man of marked
refinement. Two horses had been stolen
from Majors' stable an the night of the
murder and the- tracks of two horses rid

horse had been ridden violently
out of town, carrying Majors. the
night of the murder, led to the
a.sclosure of more facts. Majors

""' Jewell was arrested, and then followed
the â cist sensational trial ever conducted
:in Santa Clara County. A rancher named
Morrill was the sworn enemy of Jewell,
and he- took a.n oath that he would pur
sue the murderers to the ends of the
earth if need bo to secure justice. He
gave up his business and devoted himself
; solely teethe "conviction of the men. '-He
procured the evidence which stamped
Majors as the chief devil in tie scheme,
and although at the first trial- for the
murder of Renowden Majors was convict-
ed he was saved from the death penalty
by the jury This did not satisfy the pub-

men for the murder of Mclntyre. He.
was again placed before a Jury and found
guilty, with the penalty fixed -at death,
It was the desire. of Majors' counsel to
have .the second trial come off-in Oak-
land. where local prejudice was: not so
strong. It availed- him nothing- for the.
Alameda County jury sentenced 'him to

death. . A few days before he was to
mount the scaffold in the Oakland court-
yard he succeeded in breaking out of jail â 
but had. not run; a block before he was
captured* by the" firemen^" of ...the Sixth
street engine-house. â  in .this .adventure
one of -his arms was broken, and with
the fractured member in splints he was
hanged.
On the day Majors was hanged Majors'
heart-broken wife was at home with their
third child, .which had been horn soon
after the murder In th.- hills. It was a
few/ months -old on ' that black morning.

that its fate, expiated his awftiF crime.
It was discovered that a sudden rush of
blood to the' head hat caused 'death^
something almost unknown among clnl
dren under such conditions of life.
Such was the start In life of the hoy
bandits. A year or two late* i !>.â  Majorses
made their home in Oakland and the un
happy widow . married a man named
Wagner.- Who- was a solicitor. - And for
a short time there was a gleam of con
tentment if not happiness in Mrs., Wag
ner's life. Two children were born . to
them, but they were only a few years old
when their father deserted them. Mrs.
Wagner was granted a divorce and ali
monv, but.was unable to find the recreant
father. When she did find him he had
remarried, had another family and was
excused by a San Francisco Judge from
fulfilling the terms of the decree of di-

norance of their father's crime, and be
lieved that the four brothers were all the
children of Mr. and Mrs. Wagner. They
went l. v that name * iind ".'."; until Christ
mas. four years ago, did a scheming
woman tell the boys of the secret of their
birth. From that moment the boys were
completely changed. They were no longer

entirely for their mother and for her In
terests^ they became restless, dissatisfied,
wayward. desperate.' They worked
steadily for some- time, but each day found
them wandering â¢ farther into forbidden
paths. .-; . -..->;''. *
Four years ago Archie went to Chief. of
Police Lloyd and told him a peculiar
story. Hi' said that a Mrs. AVillmore, an
active member of the church, , was luring
him and his brother Abe- from their home.
She was doing this partly with the aid of
her attractive young daughter Ina, then 1'?
years old. The- boys Would frequently re
main for days at the Willmore . house,
their only- companions being Ina and Bert
Willmore. Who was about the same age
as Abe. Chief Lloyd did all In his power
to induce til. Majors ' boys to stay at
home, but without result. They declared
without reservation that they were th"
children of a murderer and that it, would
be Useless for, them to attempt to do any
thing, but follow in their father's foot
steps. Many times they started to work,
but each time they soon tired and sought
the pleasure of the street:
In the spring of 1596 Oakland was start
tied by a series of the most daring, clev
erly planned and successful burglaries,
robberies and safe cracking jobs ever heard
of in any .city. Night after night from
one to six places would be visited and
cleaned out. Safes would be cracked in
the center of town, and "the police were
powerless. Â» . ...
One morning In February two innocent
looking boys were seen by a policeman
on the water front. *_t was at the hour
when the. tug arrives with the morning
papers from San Francisco, and scores of
boys gather around to be sent on their
differ, carrier routes. When spoken to
by the policeman the two, lads -promptly
said they were newspaper , boys and the
Officer let them pass. A few steps away
was another policeman. He noticed that
the boys seemed anxious- not to pass close
by him. He called to his brother officer
and asked him what the boys had told
him., The reply was somewhat in the .na
ture of a sneer for paying any attention
to a couple of newspaper, boys whose
business was so very evident. This an
gered the other officer, and more out of
pique than Intuition he ordered tne. boys
to show him what they had in their
pockets. ' v. ! - : "-- -
â  j The contents of the two young lads'
pockets .was * a revelation- to those two
officers. There were some sticks of dyna
mite, one with a fuse attached; some
jiltro-glycerlne cartridges, two pistols,
, several. chisels and jimmies, a brace and
some bits, a couple of masks, and a few
minor articles. The boys were taken to
the. City Prison. Bert Willmore gave his
right name: the other boy was "Ralph
Ford.". : _, . _ _- '.'-.'.
: When the Chief of Police saw the boys
he was thunderstruck. "Hello, Abe," he
said: "what are yon doing here?'' -'V- 7 *',
The little ps, -ai" newspaper boy was
Abe Majors.
Then came â  the boys" confession.
Twenty-two burglaries and safe jobs had
been carried out ley them under the- very
eye of the police. The boy burglars kept
back nothing. All their plunder that was
not spent was found in a shed in the rear
of the Willmore house, and the boys told
remarkable stories, which resulted in the
arrest of Mrs. Willmore. Nothing definite
could be proved against her and she was
released. The boys were tried and sent
to Folsom for ten years.
Curiously mix.-.l with the criminal
careers of Archie and Abe Majors is a
romance. Each boy had a love affair, and
it exercised a powerful Influence over him.
Abe, who was !16 when his career of
burglary' was cut short, was desperately
in love with Ina Willmore.
After "being sent to Folsom Ina exerted
herself as much as possible to obtain a
pardon fur her convict lover. Several peo
ple were interested by her in Abe's future,
but it was owing largely to the efforts of
his -mother ami of Mrs. Balllngton Booth
and many clergymen, lawyers and jurists
that he was paroled several months ago.
i Archie Majors, after once learning the
secret of his birth, was the me.re wayward
of to- two boys. He struck out for him
self after he began to realize that his ac
quaintance with the Willmores was not
benefiting, him. He procured a horse and
went down into Texas -and Mexico, and
for sometime- was a cowboy. About two
years .ago. he .appeared in. Oakland and
stayed with his mother for a short time.
It was then he met and loved a Salvation
Army lass. Lena Stone.
Sister Lena was generally supposed at
that time to be the accepted lover of a
Salvationist at Berkeley named Under
wood, but Archie Majors proved the more
successful suitor and induced Miss Stone
to elope with him to Stockton, where they
wen married. For nearly a year Archie
and his hallelujah bride fared well. They
went i" Seattle, where a child was born,
but after that their ways appear to have
parted, and Mrs. Majors is supposed to
be- in the East with her baby.
For several months! nothing was heard
of Archie by his mother, but early this
year he appeared in Oakland and â  met
Abe, who was mi parole and was appa
rently striving earnestly to live an honest
life. The presence of Archie unsettled
Abe. and some time in March the two
lads disappeared.. They gave their
mother no Inkling of what they were go
ing to do, but this did not surprise her,
as they had long been accustomed to
please themselves.* No attention was
paid to Abe Majors ifntil the Ist of April,
on which day he should, under the terms
of- his parole, have reported to the Oak
land police authorities. His failure; to do
this was .communicated to the- Board of
Prison Directors and notice's were issued 1
that he was. a fugitive from justice.
j On Mayday the newspapers published an
account- of highway robbery and murder
by bandits at a little town In Utah. Near
Bingham some commercial travelers had
â been -held up by bandits. From a neigh
boring town came a similar story. Sheriffs
and posses went out from several Icoun
ties to capture the two bandits. After a
long search- they- were seen one evening
as they were about to enter a mountain
pass. Both were heavily armed, carrying
revolvers in their belts and Winchesters
over their shoulders. To wait for day
light would probably mean the loss of
th.' opportunity to capture the robbers.
They were pursued into the pass.
When aware of their danger they turned
on Iheir .pursuers and opened fire. The
taller of the bandits was soon a corpse.
but the younger one. apparently worked
up to. desperation by the death of bis com
panion, stood ' his ground manfully and
calmly fired. at- the officer nearest him. It
was Captain Brown of the Utah police
force, and a second later he, too, was a
c rise. ' With several guns pointed at
him the surviving bandit threw up his
arms and allowed himself to be taken
prisoner.
He told his captors that their name was
Morgan and that Chicago was their home,
but he refused to give any more partic
ulars. Contented with this' information,
th.- bandit was left in his cell. An ex
amination was made of his dead com
panion. In one of his pockets were two
photographs. One was of a young woman
and written on the back was the simple
declaration of love: "My dear wife,
Lena.'" The photograph bore the imprint
of an Alameda photographer.
The other photograph was that of a
baby in long 'clothes. The picture was
taken in Seattle. With these two remin
iscences of his happier life the bandit had
gone out to gain stolen fortune or death.
A few days later the photograph of
"Lena" was sent to Alameda. The Iden
tity of Its original was at once discovered
by a friend. It was the picture Of Lena
Stone, the "dear wife" of Archie Majors.
The rest was soon told. The "Morgan"'
brothers, the bandits of Utah, were Abe
and Archie Majors of Oakland.

With the exception of the wedding of
Miss. Mamie Burling to Dr. John Evelyn
Page! F. S. X.. which is to take place
next Tuesday evening, there is absolutely
nothing of interest on the social 'len
dar for the present week. It is the wish
of Miss Burling that her wedding be
marked by the utmost simplicity, and to
this end the invitations have been of the
most informal character and confined i"
only- a few relatives and -Intimate friends.
The ceremony will be performed at the
home of her mother, Mrs. William Bur
ling at :" o'clock, by the Rev. Father
Varsl; The bride will he attended by
Miss Hazel King, also her two tie
-nieces. Lollta and Norma Burling. Dr.
Victor C. B. Means. F. S. N., will act as
groomsman. Miss Burling has always
been exceedingly popular in San Fran
cisco, her many friends loving her for
her unselfish, womanly character, and
there is probably no member of society
.who would be more greatly missed than
"she will be. it Is, therefore, a matter of
deep regret to her friends that her mar
riage will take her away from here for
some time to come.

MISS ESSIE TITTLE, Columbia

impulsive, high-strung, excitable nature,
artistic and clever; quick to learn what
ever pleases the fancy, but utterly lack

aspiring, and would tolerate those who
are not altogether congenial, if this could
further her cause. She is tactful in her
management of people; affable and
pleasing; great adaptability to all
classes. â  Impressionable in affairs of the
heart, and carries likes and dislikes to
extremes. Quick temper, but temper is
a thing ; of the moment, and when an-,

erous and sympathetic ;Â«: free : in money
matters; extravagant in tastes. would
give fr&olv to any worthy cause when ap
pealed! to through the emotions. Music,
eloquence, poetry, color, tears, sorrow
all appeal directly to this nature. There
is no happy medium; they must either be
wildly enthusiastic and joyous or deeply
depressed. They are entirely swayed by
their emotions. They are. capable of ris
ing to th. greatest heights .if rapture,
but descend as quickly to despair.

fession, not so much from her Intellectual

JOHN J. 8., Santa Rosaâ lt would be
well for you to consult some one in whom,
you repose confidence before making any
important business venture, as you lack
perception. You have had three lawsuits
in the last two years. â¢
R. L.. Santa Rosaâ You are flirtatious;
care little for the feelings of others. You

overestimate your powers. There was an
influence in the life that caused you more
annoyance than pleasure through their
jealous affection for you.

.faculty of making people think that you
care more for them than you really do.

You had an attachment in early: life that
you never forgot. The person died. You

eef enthusiasm. She can run and jump
swing her Indian clubs and wield her
dumbbells with all the seal and ardor of
a young prize-fighter. Out-of-door sports
have become as popular with women as i
with men. The result is a generation of
hearty, wholesome women, with bright
eyes, blooming complexions and a mag
netism and personal charm that none but
the truly healthy ever have or know.
No woman ever looked pretty with a
narrow, shrunken chest or stooping shoul
ders, no matter how radiant and beauti
ful her face may have been. She just
couldn't, no matter what any one may
say to the contrary.
So, girls. If you are stoop-shouldered or
lacking in any sort of development lay
aside your old-fashioned ideas or those
that your parents may have for you and
go jn for physical culture.
Not only is it wary from a health
standpoint to develop the muscles but
it Is the only way by which a perfect fl_f
nre and a graceful poise can be obtained.
J here are exercises for the development
of every muscle in the body. a few of
these are shown in the illustrations.

baths taken as you suggest will have no
effect one way or the other upon your
weight. You do not need soap for the or
dinary daily sponge bath. Just sponge off
with the tepid water, and then rub ener
getically with a crash towel. For the hot
bath use plenty of soap and a good stiff
flesh brush. Invest 75 cents in a good
complexion brush and, with the help of a
little- castile'soap and tepid water go for
those blacKheads,. "horse, foot and dra
goons." A good, scrubbing every night,
followed by an application of the . skin
food well rubbed into the skin will work
a wonderful transformation, I am sure.
You can buy the orangeflower water al
ready prepared at any first-class drug
store. Apply Jour cream at night and if
in the morning the oil has not been en
tirely absorbed by the skin merely wipe
the face off with a slightly moistened
cloth. The little black specks on the
shoulders caused by the oils can be
scrubbed away with a flesh brush.
KATZABIANCAâ presume it is the
peroxide of hydrogen and ammonia for
superfluous hair that you wish to know
about. Apply the peroxide one night and
diluted ammonia the next. This, you un
derstand, is not a cure for the little pests.
Th. peroxide merely bleaches the hairs
and the ammonia burns them off to the
surface of the skin. They may return.

Different styles of sailor hats require dif

lowed by a thorough rubbing with olive
oil, if indulged in dally will bring about a
better state of affairs I am certain. In
using sulphur in a vapor bath cabinet I
believe you place one-fourth ounce of the
sulphur in a dry pan on top of the ring

way, as sulphur is not soluble In Water.
RUTH X.â The most harmless method
of darkening the eyebrows is to use the
walnut stain. Boil slowly an ounce of
walnut bark in a pint of water for an
hour. "Set" the dye by adding a lump
of alum the size of a hazel nut. Keep
this in a bottle and apply to the eyebrows
with a small camel's hail- brush. This
will probably give the desired tint. D i
not get the liquid on the skin, as it will
stain it.
Disinterested friendship is
such a ''very rare commodity in this work
aday world that it does seem a pity to
let a mere trifle interrupt a friendship of
this sort that has extended over so many
years, particularly when one little word
of explanation might set the whole mat
ter straight. So, as you think your friend
does not say the word for fear of being
repulsed, and as you are sure she loves
you as much as she ever. did, 1 think I
should make the first advance if I were
you. "To be wroth with one we love
doth work like madness in the brain," sii
if one little word from you will make the
whole world seem happier and brighter
to at least one person, it Is worth the
effort, don't you think?
BOISEâ Botn your "letters have reached
me, and I am exceedingly sorry you have
had to wait so long a time for a reply
to your questions, . but there were so
many, many ahead of you. It is really
almost impossible to describe in print the
movements you are desirous of learning.
It is a sort of kneading, slapping process.
The best way to learn is to go to - the
baths once, where you will get a practical
demonstration. For the particular ma
nipulation you speak of pour the oil into
the palms of the hands and rub around
and around and up as gently as possible.
1 really can tell you of no way of taking
the wrinkles out of the lips. The orange
flower skin food will answer quite the
same purpose as the cold cream.
EDITHâ It would never occur to me to
think you a nuisance, particularly when
you say such pretty, flattering things to
me. I hope you will write often. I. El
der flower water is rarely ever satisfac
tory when made by an amateur. It Is not
of a good color and will need an admix
ture of alcohol to preserve it. That sold
by druggists is obtained by distillation
and is clear and colorless and will keep
for some time. So my advice to you is
to purchase it already prepared of your
druggist. 2. I know of no way by which
a nose may be shortened, save by taking
a reef in it, and as that would be rather
a painful operation, and the result might
not be pretty, 1 would advise you to con
tent yourself with the too-generous pro
vision of nose. Pardon my levity, but 1
really couldn't restrain it. 3. I think you
are perfectly safe in using a cream that
contains neither cocoanut oil nor lanolin.

/'"?"> HE cliildren stood watching Mr. Hubs attentively, their attitude be
traying their curoslty, and doubt. They were curious to see how
Mr. Bobs could convince them that there were smarter men than
Aaron in that neighborhood, and doubtful of his ability to do bo.
... lt was plain that Mr. Bobs himself did not share their doubts, He
was in no hurry, and yet there was no delay in his movements; he
was slow but methodical. He knocked the ashes rom his pipe and
carefully cleaned it but with his pocket knife, blowing through the stein
to clear away all particles of tobacco, This done, he laid the pipe care
fully on the step beside him, reached Into the room behind him and drew
forth a washpan that seemed to bo a little mure' than half full of soapy
water. There was also iii the pan a small wooden paddle. .. With this Mr.
Hobs whipped the soapy water gently, am? the children noticed that In
stead iof breaking into a foamy mass of bubbles, as soapy water does,
three or four large bubbles appeared,
This result seemed to be unsatisfactory .'to Mr. Bobs. He drew forth
from an inside pocket of his coat a large leather or morocco pocketbook,
and began to search through its various compartments. He finally found
what he was searching forâ a little paper packet wrapped round and
round with many yards of white sewing thread. This thread Mr. Bobs
unwound very carefully. Then, unfolding the paper, he took therefrom
the nu rest 'pinch of white powder and flirted it Into the pan of water
"I reckon you'll work now. plague on you!" he exclaimed.
At this juncture Miss Elviry' came out wondering what the children
w.-re doing. Watching the manipulations â !" hi - brother, she laughed un
easily, saying: "You may thank your stars there ain't no law agin witch
craft in this part of tho country. That's all that keeps 'em from stringln'
you up.'.'
"Where's any witchcraft?" inquired Mr. Bobs indignantly. "I'm jest
a-sliowln' these youngsters a trick that I larnt from that there gypsy
'omanâ the ono that k'yurcd your rheumatis."
"Well." remarked Miss Elviry, "when folks do somethin' new an'
quare, they allers fly back to conjuration to account fer it."
"1 don't keer where they tly," said Mr. Bobs, "so long as they don't
fly at me." ....
And. as if to show that ho really didn't care, he seized the wood. pad
dle and began to whip the water again. This time all the bubbles dis
appeared save o'.\i^. and the more Mr. Bobs whipped the water the larger
it grew. Presently he placed tho pun on _ large blockâ the butt-cut of a
poplar tree which served sometimes as a table and sometimes as the wook
benchâand continued to whip the water, the bubble growing larger and
larger all tho while. Occasionally he poked his paddle into the bubble and
withdrew It quickly, as if to test Its consistency. The children could see
the paddle go into the bubble and see it come out, but the bubble Itself
remained intact and continued to expand.
"You so? dit, don't you?" exclaimed Drusilla. The bubble was now as
tall as the tallest of the children, and large around In proportion.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 14, 1899.
Mr. Bobs took his pipe, inserted it in the bubble at the edge of the pan
and began to blow with, all his might. This he did at short intervals until
all the water in the pan seemed to be exhausted. Then, with the stem of
the pipe still in his mouth, he took the paddle and carefully scraped the
bubble from the edge of the pan, and by a deft motion of his hand moved
the nan entirely.
That was certainly a sight for the children to seeâ a bubble as high
and as big as a small house swaying gently in the sunlight and showing
forth alb the colors of the rainbow. It was very wonderful Indeed, and
Sweetest Susan Was quick to declare that she had never before seen any
thing as beautiful.
Mr. Hobs seemed to be very much gratified at this. " Taint the best
I can do," he explained. "I'd have to make a dozen or more, before I git
my hand in. But this un Is good enough. Ef you find anybody round here
what can build a bubble that won't bust ncr float off. why, jest ax 'em to
do It, that's all. No," he declared, "that ain't all, nuther." *
He took a small leaf and laid it on the side of the bubble. Instantly it
began to rotate and travel In a small circle, drawing after it, as it seemed,
the most beautiful shades ot green and gold and purple. it seemed in
deed to bo th" center of an iridescent whirlpool, and the children stood
gazing at it with open mouths and eyes.
The glistening colors appealed strongly to Drusilla. "Kf you could hoar
brass bands a-playln*," she exclaimed, "Sis wouldn't lack "much er bein'
a hole circus." â¢.."'â¢â -
Mr. Bobs walked around tho bubble and examined it critically, smooth
ing it with his wooden paddle.
"I'm jest a feelin' round fcr to find whar the door Is," lie explained.
Apparently he soon found it, for he spoke to Buster John. "Come on," he'
said, "jump right In." The youngster hesitated for an Instant, but his
surroundings gave him assurance. "Walk right in," Mr. Bobs insisted,
and gave a quick flirt with the paddle as Buster John touched the- bubbleâ
a quick flirt with the paddle, and Sweetest Susan and Drusilla saw Buster
John disappear, swallowed up, as it were, by the bubble. '
"Now, then." said Mr. Bobs, waving his paddle on high, "come on, an'
in wi' you! There, plunge right in!"
Sweetest Susan went forward timidly. "Is ft going to fly away with
us, Mr. Bobs?" she asked. She had already experienced one adventure
that was not pleasing to think of.
"Why, what ide^es you've got. honey!" exclaimed Mr. Bobs. "How can
a bubble fly away with you children on the inside? You might as well ax
me ef a crow can fly away wi* a bale of cotton."
"But this bubble is different from other bubbles," suggested Sweetest
Susan.
"It is: it shore is." assented Mr. Bobs; "it shore is. fer I made it my
self. But, in wi' you; don't let your buddy git lonesome."
Sweetest Susan was still a little afraid, but she went forward ail the
same, and the bubble seemed to swallow her just as it had swallowed
Buster John.
Mr. Bobs now turned to Drusilla. "Come on, ef you're a-comin'."
"1 ain't bleedze ler go in eiar. is I?" she asked.
"Dei in or stay out; it's all one to me. Come! Talk out! Which is it?
It'll do you no good to go in. ner no harm, nuther."
Drusilla hesitated a moment, just a moment, and then she went to the
bubble. "I don't want none er dat ar soapsuds ter git In my eyes," she
remarked with a shiver. #
"Shet your eyes, then." said Mr. Bobs.
Drusilla did more than that, she held her breath. Then, with a whiff
of dampness on her face, she found herself inside the bubble, She turned
to see where and how she got in, but she was so surprised at the view that

KNIGHTS OF HONOR.
The visit of Keystone and Occidental

long be remembered with pleasure by the
members of the sitting lodge. The hall
was crowded with visitors and there were
present several grand officers. A fine pro
gramme, well carried out. was the fea
ture of the evening. The bright numbers
were "Bat. lift" Highway" and "Sally In

of tho order, and the conversation be
i tween the prince of ventriloquists. .1. P.
Dwyer, and his friend Casey. F. A. Jen

LOYAL BRITISH DAUGHTERS.
The members of Britannia Lodge,

respect for so solemn a day as Decora-

who stood by the flag that the honor of
the country should be maintained, that
they decided not to hold their usual
monthly social, which falls on that day.
and have postponed it until th. last Tues
day in June. This example by a foreign
association of showing respect for the
day and demonstrating sympathy for
i those who died for (lag and country is

WOODMEN OF THE WORLD.
Special Organizer James H. Garratt, a

presented itself that she fairly gasped with astonishment. Away off in _^?
distance she i mild see somebody that resembled Mr. Bobs, but he seem
to be hanging In the air. heels upward. Not far from him was his house,
and that, too, was upside down. By some curious freak of perspe c tne
the house and its surroundings, Including Mr. . Bobs, presented a picture
not larger than your thumbnail. * *
"1 didn't know I wuz sech a mighty- jumper," she said to herself.
Then she looked around for Buster John and Sweetest Susan, and saw
them some distance away. They were evidently as much puzzled as she
was. The bubble no longer seemed to be a bubble. Viewed from the out
side it had appeared to be no larger than a small house. In the inside,
however, as Drusilla remarked, it was as big as all outdoors. They
walked about timidly at first for fear of breaking the bubble, but they
soon forgot all about that precaution. They seemed to be in a wile and
perfectly level fieldâ a field with a shining floor. Over this floor the many
hued colors of the rainbow chased one another Incessantly, wriggling,
twisting, whirling. The children watched this display until Drusilla made
a remark that had astonishing results. : : v : â¢ '.
"I know whar- we at," she .said; "dish yer place is whar dey make rain
bows.' You kin see nm plattln' urn now."
At this both Buster John and Sweetest Susan laughed aloud; where
upon the rainbow colors seemed to be shattered into thousands of frag
ments, and they ran about on the floor, shaken into all sorts of disturbed
shapes.- Almost as curious as this spectacle were the wonderful echoes
that took up the sound of the children's laughter, carrying it away and
bringing it back In greater volume. A thousand children seemed to be
laughing, sometimes close at hand, and then far away.
â  Drusilla was alarmed. "I done tol' you-all 'bout puttin' yo' heads in
all kinder holes an' traps," she said under her breath. "You may call dis
a bubble ef you wanter; but 'taint no mo' a bubble dan I'm a bubble.
Look over yo' head; does yo' see any bubble-skin er frame, er hide, er
whatsomever you may call it? No, you don't. 'Stidder dat, yo' see two
suns a-shinin*. I done promise myse'f when we went und' dat spring dat
I want gwine let yo' drag me In no mo' places. An' yit, here I is! You
done' drag me in here, an' now yo' got ter. drag me outâ ef I ever is ter
git out." â  . - ' ' :*
--"Why. there's nothing to do but to break the bubble," Buster John
stoutly asserted. -.'- â 
"Show me whar dey's any bubble." cried Drusilla. "Yo* don't see none,
an' I don't see none. We're in a rainbow fact'ry. an' we better git out fo'
it thunders."
Drusilla's considerations led the children to look around them more
carefully than they had done; and even Buster John was compelled to
admit that he could see nothing like the walls of a bubble, if walls they
may be called.
One fact that disturbed Tin m more than any other was that they could
--.... no horizon line. The horizon exists only in the imagination, but it
plays a very important part In our actual experience. it provides a boun
dary, a limit. But It was absent now, and its absence, together with the
fact that two separate and distinct suns appeared to be shining overhead,
gave a" weird aspect to this new landscape, or, to be more exact, the
bubble-scape. And. while the shimmering, seething, whirling, rainbow
colors were beautiful to behold, they began to add to the confusion after
a while. -
In .the midst of it all Drusilla sneezed, not once, but twice. She tried
bard to keep the sneezes back, to "hoi' 'em in," as she said, but they bad
to come, and when they did come they seemed. to shake the foundation
of things, and the sound of ten thousand sneezes was heard in the air.
The two suns overhead reeled and shook and whirled about each other,
and the colors whirled in the floor till they lost all semblance of propor-
And then, while waiting for this devastation to stop itself, the children
saw a little woman come gliding toward them, followed by a swarm of
smaller figures. . , "
"We're gone now," exclaimed Drusilla excitedly. "We done stirred urn
up. We better make a break an', git out er here 'fo' dey jump qn us an'
git us down." - * : *-*.'
But somehow neither Buster John nor Sweetest Susan was frightened.
There was nothing alarming about these little peopleâ if people they were.
The little woman, who seemed to be the leader, was not ugly at all. If
_.'),. had been an old crone with a yellow tooth, the children might have
felt some uneasiness, but her appearance was very pleasing, although she
seemed to be somewhat weary- And all the smaller ones that came after
her seemed to be solemn and weary. But they were not too weary to form
themselves in a ring, of which the children were the center, and go
marching around, singing a song of complaint. Their voices were not
strong, and it was all the children could do to catch a few of the words
of the song. A part of it was as follows;
If you stay awake while you sleep,
You will find that the whole isn't half;
You will find it is funny to weep.
And awfully solemn to laugh.
Oh. hear one cause of complaint-
It 'tis, it 'twas, it 'taint!
"I tell you dcv got us!" said Drusilla in a low tone. "Dey ain't no
sense in what dey singin'. Dey er all ravin" crazy. Look at urn, how dey
Heads of the Two Brandies of Freemasonry
in This Country Reside in San Francisco.
CALIFORNIA, and particularly Ban
Francisco, has the honor of
having as residents two well
known men who represent the
heads of the two distinctive
branches of the oldest and great
est of all fraternities, the Freemasons, an
honor that no other city in the world has
ever had. Not only is San Francisco spe
cially honored in having these two men,
but It is the home of not only the highest
officer of the fraternity In the United
States, but the ranking Masonic dignitary
of the entire world. The latter is Judge
Thomas 11. Caswell, who is at the head
i Of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite,
and tho other Is Reuben H. Lloyd, who is
at the head of the York Rite.
To enter into even a concise history of
Freemasonry would require much more
space than is allotted to a daily newspa
per article, but It is sufficient to assert
that it Is traced back to the old Roman
empire, to the Pharaohs, the temple' of
Solomon and even back to the tower of
Babel and the ark of Noah. Preston, an
authority on Freemasonry, says. "From
the commencement of the world we may
trace the foundation of Masonry."
Practical Freemasonry had its origin in
the guilds or crafts that existed in the
earliest days of the building art. Men
who were skilled in the -hewing and set-*
ting of stones were in those times highly
prized, and their, vocation required that
they should travel from place to place for
employment. ; ;/c
When any great building was to be
erected the local masons were reinforced
by many fellow-craftsmen from other
parts, and these strangers to the place
lived In a camp by themselves at a point
convenient to the building on which they
were engaged. There was, one who pre
sided over the. whole who was called ma*-
ter, and over every; ten men there was
one who directed them and was called
warden, he being subject to the orders of
the master. A mason before he could
reach th.- station of master mason had
first to serve his apprenticeship, and after
probation, during which he demonstrated
skill and Intelligence, attained recognition ]
among his fellow-craftsmen; he then rose 1
to warden and finally to the high, rank
then known, master mason. Having to'
migrate from place to place, those ma- I
sons devised moans to enable one who
was a member of the fraternity to be .
able to go from one place to another
without giving at each new place fresh '
evidence of his skill or having to be sub
mitted to an examination as to his quali
fications. To that end a system of sym- j
One of the Most Singular Honors in the History of the Great Order.
I hols was agreed upon, into the mystery
of which every mason was initiated and
: bound by oath to keep secret and never
reveal to any one not entitled to re
ceive the same. This enabled the ma
sons t.i recognize one another, and the
â  fact that one had such secrets was a
guarantee that he was entitled to the
assistance and hospitality of any other
mason who possessed them and could
give proof that he did possess them.
This is generally the foundation of the
; fraternity which holds first rank in the
civilized world, and while it is not now
composed exclusively of working masons,
: as in the days of old. it Is made up of
men who. imbued with the spirit of fair
ness, brotherly love and charity for one
oi their own in needâ not charity in the
sense of almsgiving but in the spirit that
â¢Â°-f men to , n Â«*lP one another when the
occasion reQtdres-havtng recognised the
inestimable value 0 the bonds of such
brotherly devotion. PÂ«PÂ«?tuated them and
builded art institution that will last until
time shall be no more, carrying out the
principles of moral and social virtue,
Practicing charity in its broad sense,
exemplifying brotherly love and lmpress
ing ' on all the sublime value of truth and
the golden rule.
There has been some question' as to the
origin of the word Freemason, some
holding that it applied ii all of the
ancient craft by reason of being exempted
from certain obligations that wore-im
posed on common laborers. In England
the name Freemason appears for the
first time in the statutes 25 Edward I of
Lngland, 1350. and was used to distinguish
a stone .mason, or one who worked in
freestone, a? distinguished from the rough
mason, or one who merely built walls of
rough stones.
1' was not until the beginning of the
seventeenth century that persons not op
erative .masons began to unite - with
Freemasons and they were distinguished
from the working masons by the term
"accepted." .;.:.-':
The Freemasons of Scotland claim their
origin from 1151. while those of England
go still further back to an assemble of
Masons called together in 926 at York.
There will be next month .an unusuai
event in Edinburgh, it being the celebra

When the song, if such it could be called, was done, the little woman
came toward the children. Her attitude was not threatening, but Dru
silla made haste to get behind her companions.
"You don't seem to know me," the little woman said.
"No, we don't. Who are you?" asked Sweetest Susan. 1
"I'm the Queen of Dreams." replied the other. 7
"An*, we dreaming now?" Buster John asked somewhat bluntly.
"How could that be? said the Queen of Dreams. "You are not asleep!
and we are only here because of a hideous noise we heard. We were
asleep. Do you think we should be disturbed in our own kingdom? We
can't help ourselves at this moment, but do you think it is right to invade
our territory?" .... 'Â *
"What she talkin bout? asked Drusilla in a whisper. "Who's been
â¢vadin' any ter'ytory?
"Why, Mr. Bobs made this bubble for us," Buster John explained.
The Queen of Dreams seemed to be puzzled. "What is a bubble?" she

"Why. a bubbleâ a bubble isâ well, a bubble is a piece of soapsuds into
which air has been blown," replied Sweetest Susan somewhat doubtfully.
"How big a piece, and how much air is necessary- to make a bubble?"
inauired the Queen of Dreams. -
"I'm sure I don't know, responded Sweetest Susan. "Bubbles are of
â¢ill sizes- but this one is the largest I ever saw."

From that point the Master Mason, who
to reach that point has to devote a great
: deal of time to study, that he may obtain
a full understanding of the principles of
Masonry, may elect to take the ten de
grees of the York Rite or the thirty de
grees of the Scottish Rite. He is also
privileged to take them in both rites,
should he feel so inclined.
The York Rite is divided into three sec

Mark Master (4), Past. Master (5).' Most

Master (10); and then the Commanderv of
Knights Templar, which has three orders
and these are only conferred on Royal
Arch Masons. They are the Red Cross
Knight (11). Knight Templar (12) and
Knight of Malta (13). That is the sum

These are progressive steps into higher
Masonry from the symbolic lodge and

Ignored her local productions and

those whom I had tried to serve, I
turned to th" dramatic columns of the
Tuesday newspapers and found consola
tion In their disagreement as to the
merits of Mr. Greene's farce. The
Chronicle praised It, Th.- Call patron
ized it good-humoredly, the Examiner
found it violently immoral and sug
gested In the plainest language that the
"word "wife" in the title be changed
to something less. This was promis
ing, and when night came I hied me
to the Alcazar to find out for myself.
Mr. Greene's, farco deals principally
In that amiable hospitality which the
Japanese hold out to visitors in their
landâ the "marriage contract" limited.
The scenes are in America, and the Jap
anese characters are Just two in num
ber â little Miss Go and her largo papa,
who Is by heredity and profession a
wrestler. Harry Merfifleld and his
friend Michael Patrick McGuffin have
returned from a sojourn in the chry
santhemum country. .. The former is
married and presumably virtuous: the
latter has indulged in a "contract mar
â¢ riage" with Miss <;<'. whiie in Japan,
and is now the legitimate affianced of
Miss Bessie Stow, a young woman of
his own race. Young Merrifleld is writ
ing a book on Oriental life that in one
â¢chapter handles the custom of "con
tract marriages" with ardent realism.
This chapter falls under the eyes of his
wife and his wife's father, and
ls suspected by them of being
autobiographical. At this juncture
.tht. Jap wrestler and his daugh
ter, who have been urged to Am
erica by a zealously moral missionary.
. arrive at the Merrifleld residence,
where Miss Go discovers her long lost
Michael Patrick McGuffin, falls on his
neck and languishes In the sweets of
osculation that her Unversed Japanese
lips had learned from him. Michael P.
is'not a willing accomplice to this dent
onstration, but when the mighty wrest
ler limbers up his muscles and says.
"Kiss wife," Michael's objections are
left unsaid. Fearing discovery he in
duces his friend to take the embarrass
ing visitors into the Catskjlls, whither
.young Merrifleld is bound on a vaca
tion. The next two acts are in a Bum
mer hotel in the Catskills and back
again in the Merrifleld household. Of
course Merrifleld is made to suffer the
brunt of the Japanese invasion. His
wife and relations turn up at the hotel,
where by sum.- means or another the
girl has become registered as his wife.
This complication is kept up until the
last, when the Japs d. part, McGuffin
confesses and is forgiven and happi
ness reigns in the Merrifleld household.
Now for the life of me I can't see
where the moral* or the Immorals of
"His Japanese Wife" come to question.
The called "contract marriage" does
obtain in Japan, and a very popular
institution it is, I am told on the best
of authority. It has been written about
by other pens with much more candor
and license than Mr. Greeneallowshim
self without attracting the attention
of the prudes. Mr. Greene treats the
subject humorously, flippantly even,
but not wantonly. I cannot recall an i
unseemly line or situation in the whole
piece. Some persons might object to
the caricature of the missionary, but
that would be on artistic rather than
moral grounds, for he is in every sense
the conventional third sex of farce. Th.
one bit of absolute suggestion is in the
best character that Mr. Greene has
drawn, the mother-in-law. By a happy
bit of topsy-turvydom he has evolved
a sweet-tempered, affectionate mother
in-law, who loves her son-in-law and
stands up for him whenever there is
any possible chance to do so' and even
when there is not. He is equally fond of
her. and as Mr. Hastings plays him his
devotion runs largely to smacks and
embraces, which are enthusiastically
yet coquettishly received and returned.
Had this play come from the French it
were easy to imagine an unpleasant
situation,- but written as it is in the
healthiest American spirit, one can at
the most only challenge the players*,
interpretation. Mr. Greene is all right
morally. His sins are merely those of
most play writ. rs. He has not written
a perfect play. But at least he sins
with originality, in that he has written
too little rather than too much. "His
Japanese Wife" is not, in my opinion,
sufficiently rated to give the
proper suspense to Its main Incidents
and the proper definiteness to its main
characters. There should be more knots
to be tied and untied in its Intrigue.
The counterplot, which concerns itself
with the thorny pathed engagement
of the Widow McGuffin and Mr. Mudd,
would better be based on something
more strenuous than the absurdity of
the prospective husband's name. Young
McGuffin is the stepson of Mrs. Mc
<'tiffin, and his father's will gives him
some sort of say over the widow's re
marriage. This situation has many
humorous possibilities, and several of
them have been seized upon by Mr.
Greene, but the stepson's objection to
the name of Mudd is long-drawn-out
and in the end unprofitable. Evidently
the farce has boon put together in- .some
haste. It is clever in idea, original in
several of the characters, practically
effective if not brilliant in dialogue;
but it Is lacking in that careful work
manship which Mr. Greene is capable of
when be exacts from himself nothing
less than his best. The amiable
mother-in-law is a rich new figure, and
the transferring of all the peevish
qualities that usually belong to this
character to the father-in-law- is
another striking feat; the Japanese
wrestler is sharply comic as well as
satiric, and his demure daughter is a
perfectly poised characterization, full
of unconscious fun. the best kind of all.
Tin-, other characters are, naturally,
conventional (you don't expect a man
to revolutionize the stage every time he
writes a play), hut quite good in their
kind. The piece is very entertaining in
Its present form, but to be worthy of
its inspiration it needs liberal elabora
tion and shaping. The principal char
acters should stand out more poignant
ly, and there certainly ought to be more
hurrah when the curtain falls on the
first and second acts.
The Alcazar's production in about as
good as could be given in the circum
stances of the company. .The scenery
1." sane and comely; there la an unac
customed air of stage management In
the grouping and general deportment
of the players (doubtless due to the
personal attention of the author), and
the individual acting is keener than
usual. Miss Laura Crews is noticeably
to the front as the Japanese girl, whom
she invests with just the right blend
of ingenuousness and insinuation. The
mother-in-law la only fairly realized by
Miss Marie Howe, and her spouse is
conventionally handled by Clarence
Montaine. Charles Bryant does con
siderable but not enough in the prodi
gious part of the Japanese wrestler,
and Howard Scott makes the mission
ary out to be a more banal figure than
he really is. Mr. ; Hastings gives an
easy, natural personality to Merrifleld,
and Daniel Halifax wallows In stagy
animation as his friend, McGuffin. Miss
Fitzallen plays Mrs. Merrifleld as she
iilavs everything else, with all the ob
vious arts and lures of a bygone
scheme of acting. But on the whole the
Alcazar deserves credit for its enter
prise. There is nothing like a new play
to set the town a-talking. I can think
0 only one practicable sensation that
would be more successful than "His
Japanese Wife," and that would be a
new, attractive, human leading woman.

Bo much discussion of endowed theaters
is now going on, led by William Archer,
that people will be interested in those
views of Forbes Robertson: "A state
theater I do not believe inâ that is, for
this country: Fooling is yet too strong
against the theater in many quarters to
make it possible to legislate for a state
playhouse. My dream is for an endowed
theater, which would be the home of the
standard drama. ' Why should not some
wealthy man come forward with a gift
of money and establish such an Institu

lion? The cry is, of course, that such a
speculation would not pay. But does the
man who haunts the racecourse and bets
on horses run a better chance of return
for his' outlay? Yet look at the thousand*.
a wealthy man will squander in this way.
I don't say l am sanguine that our savior
will arise hi the near future. 1 only asK
why the charitable and philanthropic man
always neglects the sacred cause of art
in his bequests and legacies? Obviously
such a theater must be the home of
standard plays. I would attach to ii act
ors who have learned their businessâ old,
young or mi. i-l]. '1 The plays would
bo changed frequentlyâ once a
weekâ and no long runs would be coun
tenanced. The salaries of the endowed
theater would not bo high, but the
amount would not represent an actor's
value at what I may call one of the' com
mercial houses. The income might notâ
indeed, would not likelyâ meet the ex
penditure for the first few years, but in
the end I am convinced the scheme would
even pay."
A few weeks ago Victor Herbert's
"Wizard of the Nile" was produced in
Munich of course in a German transla
tion. The Mum hem Allgomelne. a news
paper of high standing and old fame,
thought the event worthy of a very elab
orate criticism. The critic takes 11 for
granted that the "Wizard of the Nile"
was Intended as a burlesque on Verdi's
"Aida," and so he trios to point out that
the, authors unfortunately have failed to
accomplish the deed. The book, ho re
marks, is not at all cleverly made, and its
jokes are coarse. He admits, how. v.-r,
that th.- character of Cleopatra is well
drawn.
After reciting the story of the book in
detail, he turns toward the music, start
ing with the following remarkable asser
tion: "The composer,'' he says, "has made
use of Verdi's music more in an imitative
than in an ironical way. There are prety
melodies, but they are molded rather af
ter the original without succeeding in
making fun of them.". â¢--

NEW YORK. STOCK MARKET.
'..'â NEW A. IRK, May 13.â Speculation opened in
:!(_â â¢ highly demoralized condition to-day owing to
â the sudden death of former . Governor Flower,
r.pne'ral news was scant, but man} rumors con
nected with the properties identified with the
â¢,-la.te financier were circulated. ' The flood ' of
''liquidating orders and the activity after the
â¢ tnlt'-a] 'break carried all of the Flower special -
â¢ri-es:d>wn at a terrific rate. The extreme'
-.breaks. In these properties as compared with
â yesterday were New. York Ail Brake 60 pot nts,
'â¢ 'Brooklyn Transit liS%, People's las 18, Inter;
:.iiaiional Paper 14%, Federal Steel 11%, Rock
Island t's and Atchison preferred 4. In the
.fen era I railway list extreme declines ranged ln
:t hi. active shares up to .' 3 In Burlington. In
â tlie speculative specialties American Steel
"dropiied ll.s, -â .'.. S%, Colorado Fuel 7>4,
Manhattan and Metropolitan 6% each, Ameri
can Smelter 6 und National Steel, Continental
Tobacco and Anaconda Mining over 4 points
each. The appearunee of supporting orders and
the absorption of a large amount in the 'ag
gregate by bargain burners, together with large
covering ot short lines brought about a very
material rally, which was emphasized In the
properties which had Buffered most earlier.
Part of the extreme decline was due to tin- In
numerable Stop-loss orders as well as the wip
ing out of many marginal accounts. During
.the early violence the facilities of brokers had
(been more or less severely, taxed, and orders
could not be accepted for execution except ' 'at
the market." The lowest point reach. by
â¢ stocks to-day in many Instances was abe.ve the
low' point Lii Tuesday last. The Flower special
' ties, however, were exceptions and touched the
.lowest in sorrte time. The announcement by a
k 'member of the firm of Flower & Co. that Mr.
,p!ower had ii.. stocks on hand tint were not
(paid for and that they would not come to this
iliarket had a reassuring effect. That firm,
moreover, was a purchaser for clients of a
large line of stock on the decline. London sold
some 20.000 shares at the opening, and later
! Mas a small purchaser. The bank statement
â¢ was not fully ip to the expectations of some,
and realizing and the putting out of fresh short
lines against depressed prices after the rally
â¢ left â¢ quotations much .>-,.- the low
â  est. The net losses were generally less than half
i>f the extreme declines. In the Flower special
s-ties net losses re: New York Air Brake 21.
Brooklyn Transit ll'.. People's Gas 6%; Federal
'Steel 6'/K International Paper 3's and Atchison
lanei Rock Island about 214 each The dealings
I'pr the day aggregate about three-quart of
a million shares during the two hours' trading
and the lightning .ion:.:-- of quotations as tre
mendous blocks of stock changed ownership
was bewildering to the ordinary traders. The
opinions of many old operators were widely
divergent, and the quotations quickly proved
the uselessness of attempting to guess at the
course of prices. After the first fifteen min
utes comparative quiet ensued, but still com
pared with other days, the dealings were enor
mous. The market closed under pressure, but
materially above Tile- lowest.
The market this week suffered two violent
declines, the first on Tuesday, when agitation
a.s to the probable effect of the Ford tax
bill worked havoc with values. This was fol
lowed by an irregular recovery until the an
nouncement of the death of ex-Governor Flower
lei-day gave a. hock to the market, resulting
- In a dip below the figures of Tuesday for his
specialties and bringing the general list nearly
down to the lower level established earlier in
the reek. A recovery of part of the loss took
place before the end of the Jay's session. The
net losses in the railways range from frac
tions up to over 3 points In Burlington. Lacka
wanna lost 3 and Centra] Pacific, Southern Pa
cific and Northwest an over a point each off
lor the week. In the specialties tie.- more pro
nounced losses for the week were: New York
Air Brake, %y_; Brooklyn Transit, 224; People's
Gas, 10; Federal Steel, 8%. and Atchison pre
ferred and International Paper, over 6 points
each. All these are properties in which the
Flower interest was prominent. Among the
local shares which suffered because of the
probability of the Ford franchise bill becoming
a law were Metropolitan Street Railway, 16%;
Thir.l Avenue, 13; Consolidated Gas, 7Vh, and
Manhattan, 6. Sharp declines were likewise
made by American Tobacco and the iron and
n".. 1 shares. The Government crop report was
at first favorably received, but later the de
crease in acreage was i.. -.1 out a;, a dis
couraging factor, with a resultant depressing
effect upon the grangers. - Money ruled fairly
' easy and starting exchange receded on the an
nouncement that all the needed exchange had
been secured for the settlment of the Spanish
Indemnity. Another' influence on the exchange
market was, the enormous purchases of stocks
for foreign account, which aggregated about
200,000 shares, .inly a tenth of which were re
sold on the announcement of Mr. Flower's
death. Th- deposit of the final $5,000,000 war
rant for the Spanish indemnity with a local
bank, which was announced for Monday, was
expected to i. reflected in a continued im
provement In next week's bank statement. The
traffic returns for April compared favorably
with recent months an.l with th corresponding
month in the last four years. The reports of
failures for the first week of May showed -the
smallest liabilities of any week In six years.
This was not unnaturally accompanied by fa
vorable trade reports especially in the Iron
arid -â¢...â¢I Industries, where high.-:- quotations
fe.r many classes of the output .were noticeable.
The market was highly professional In stock
dealings, and while some holdings were sacri
ficed confident buying was not lacking by large
interests on declines,
Increase.! activity was noted In â¢ the week's
bond market and a generally higher level of
prices was established for the gilt-edged is-
Fues. Speculative bonds, however, suffered,
moving pretty much In unison with stocks.

NEW YORK FINANCIAL CONDITION.
NEW YORK, May 13.â New York Finan- |
cier says:
As was to be expected, the bank statement
for the current week shows some heavy changes
over previous totals, but in the aggregate they
were not as heavy, as the operations of the
1 week had led the financial world to expect.
' It had been anticipated that the excess re
serve. would rise aim. .st. if not quite $13,000,000,
for In addition to the heavy liquidation duel
to Stock Exchange business the banks had
gained' something like a million and a half
from the interior and the Treasury operations,
Involving as they did the payment of the
Spanish indemnity, had made the banks a cred
itor to the extent of ten millions, counting that
portion of the- initial payment .not included in
the statement of May 6. The gain in cash,
however, as reported Saturday, was only about !
eight and a quarter millions and the Increase
in deposits (ess than two millions. There was
a shrinkage in loans of $3,956,700, and the ef
fect o." the changes noted was to Increase the
surplus reserve $7,785,675
Thus the statement seems far out of bal
ance, even from an average standpoint, but
when it is taken under details. Interesting :
. facts are disclosed. The National City Bank, :
as the agent through which Spain's payment]
was made, .gained almost fifteen and a half
: millions in deposits, its cash increase was al
most as great and its loan expansion about two
and a half millions. This seems logical in '
i view of th" known facts, and it is also ap- .
â  parent that In the totals of the remaining
' banks must be sought the changes that make
I the statement confusing. The result is not
j satisfactory, for the real operations of the- 1
week do not coincide with the showing thus I
made. The svst.-m of averages employed Is
doubtless responsible" for the discrepancy, and
it is also responsible for .another fact which
gives an unfavorable tinge to the exhibit. The j
reserve carried by all the banks for the week
ending May 13 equals 28 per cent of their
deposits, as against 27.1 per cent for the previ
ous week. If the National City Bank totals.
Including the heavy gains, are separated, it
becomes apparent that the other banks in the

haired and very old lady,
who cried out as if in Joy when
she saw him: "At last, at last, my bold deliverer has come, It is
he, the braA'e Prince I Don't Care; and now I will be free once more.
Help me. Prince, to get out of this horrible jar, that I may tell you
my sad story, and thank you for coming to my rescue after I have
long giA-en up all hope of ever seeing the light of day again."
The Prince was as generous as he was brave. His motto was:
"Never fear; neA-er fail." A few stout blows with the bin of the
sword cracked the jar, which fell apart in two pieces. Forth stepped
the lady, who was izzlingly beautiful. The- Prince had never Been any
one half as lovely, and he stood enchanted before th.- stranger. He
took off his plumed hat and bowed very low. "Madam," he said, "I
am glad to do you any service In my power. Let me conduct you
outside of this horrible castle to the garden." ' .'
"Ah." exclaimed the lady, and tears sprang to her .-yes and ran
down her fair cheeks. '1 beg that you will first permit me to speak
Avith the giant Abraminidin. and I will try to explain why. I am one
of seA*en sisters who were daughters of a great King. Into the king
dom there came a young Prince who was. like yourself, young, brave
and handsome. He soon had from me a promise that I would be his
bride. Departing to go to his native land, he asked from me some
keepsake that he might treasure while we were separated by distance.
I had a key. upon a golden chain, which had been my mother's. I had
been taught that this key had magic powers, but I was headstrong,
and did not believe that there was any magic in it. To make a long
story" short, I gave him the key when he asked for it. and he departed.
'.'That very night, when Aye were all sleeping, the gates of -the
palace were opened and into the palace came seA-en giants. My father,
the King, who was a very bra v.- man, ran out to tight the giants.
Alas, he Avas struck down and his head rolled on the door. My sisters
were all carried away by the giants, to be shaves. I was brought
across the sea to this dreadful place. I would not toil for the giant,
Abraminidin. He. therefore, being in bad temper, placed me in that
j.u A\htre you found me. I cried out so that I disturbed the giant's
sleep. He threatened me with death, but I answered that I would
rather di- than remain In that jar. Thereupon he savagely promised
that I should stay there one hundred years.
'-'Your courage and daring have led you to be my preserver. But,
yet. I will not be the gainer for your coming until I regain the key
Which 1 gave to my lover, the Prince. He was caught by the giants
as he journeyed to his home. From him Abraminidin took the magic
key.'ifhjch he has noAV. ('.nee- a door has been locked by that key,
no other key will move the lock. Abraminidin is now hiding in a
dungeon and has â¢ â¢â el the key to lock the dungeon door. Let me
but speak to him and he will come forth if be thinks that. you are
not near... When the door is open, then will be your. chance .to rush
forAvard and ay Abraminidin. So I will serve you. Se*Jze, then,
the m:igic. key, nd that will glA*e me back my home and my happi
ness." ' â¢ . â¢â¢
.. !â "â¢ Prince T Don't Care was moved by this story and by the tears of
the lady, and he was pleased with her great beauty.
â : "It will please me greatly to assist you," he said to the lady. "You
shall speak to the giant. Then truly will I slay him. Thenceforth
'â I. -will guard you as you Journey to your home, that no harm may
befall you, and happy am I that fortune has led me here."
â¢â¢'Lead the way. then," Bald the lady.
"'â¢* "After" you." said the Prince.
"No," said the lady, "thei*e are dangers in the way, mayhap, and
you should go before."

FOXEY FOX was a young fox,
Avho had lived with his mother all
his small life until she died, when
he had to html a mo for him
self. The home he found was a
very cozy one. It was an old hollow
tree surrounded by dense foliage. He
could see all who passed, while nobody
could see him.
EA'ery night he would take his bag
on his arm and march gaily forth,
though the ether was cold and Jack
Frost was biting his Angers and toes.
Perhaps he would come back with a
chicken or a duck, and sometimes both
ing at all. In this Avay he lived through
the winter.
One day he was awakened by voices.
Mrs. Bruin was talking to her husband.
"It is spring," said she, "and I must
begin clearing the house." " "Very
well," said Mr. Bruin, "but don't work
too hard, dear." And with these part
ing -words Mr. Bruin put on his hat
and took his cane and went to "see a
bear."
"If it really is spring," thought Foxey
to himself, "I too must clean my house.
But 1 have no wife to do It for me and
must do It for myself."
Then he took all the things out of the
house and started in to sweep it. How
did be do it? Why, with his tail, of
course. You know a fox's tail is very
busby and would serve splendidly as a
brush. When he finished sweeping he
put all things back. Then he made
himself a new bed of moss and leaves.
But *Avhat should be done for a cup
board? 'He had never used one before,
â byt noAv he thought what a conAcni
erice it would be to have some place.to
put the fowls he aught where they
My SHADOW
THERE is a little girlie
Who plays with me each day.
And though she's sometimes surly
I miss her when away.
Sometimes she walks beside me
Or else runs on ahead.
Just as vexing as can be,
Nor listens to what is said.
â¢When I think she's run away,
And perhaps slighted feels,
I find her right there at her play
Of stepping on my heels.
V When first I rise she's tiny.
r* But quickly grows till noon â¢
. Find* hl-r as big as I am;
And I know she'll beat me soon.
Then just the other evening
1 stood beside the gate
Wondering and wondering
Why papa was so late.
HEN Prince I Don't Care en
tered the castle He searched
lone for the giant Abramini
din, opening dungeon after
dungeon 1 In A-ain. At last he
came tee a great closet in which
there were shelves, upon which
huge earthen jars were stand
ing. Striking these jars one
after another with his good
sword, the Prince knew by
the hollow sound that they
were all empty except one.
From this one jar a voice
came: "Mercy, Abraminidin,
you promised me that I should
not he disturbed for one hun
dred years." Here was a
mystery. "Who are you who
speak so strangely?" the
Prince- demanded. There was
no answer to his question,
The Prince climbed up on one
of the high shelves and looked
down. In the earthen Jar
i he-re was a little, white-
#*o*v-C-*v*v*C>*o*v ;<>*C-*C'*v*
could not get away. Finally a bright
large hole in one corner of his house.
When the hole was finished he found a
bramble which he bent into a rounded
shape and placed it over the hole.
Over that he threw an old sack which
he had found, and he had a complete
cupboard ready for use. Wasn't he a
smart fox.
One evening he was invited to at
tend a party given by Miss Wolf. He
w.-nt. found his hostess charming, and
talked to her so Jong that the moon
had gone down and the stars were dis
appearing when he realized what time
it was and how sleepy Miss Wolf was
getting. He hastily bad.- her good
night (when he should have said good
morning) and went quickly home.
But sitting In the cold night air, on
damp earth, with wind blowing chillily,

And would not let me pass.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 14, 1899.
'It is well," said the Prince., as he started to walk to, the only
dungeon that he had not yet visited.
Hardly had he turned to go when the lady threw her arms around
his neck from behind and clutched his throat with all her strength.
Tin- little woman seemed to have the strength of many men. The
Prince struggled, but could not push her hands away.
"Abraminidin, oh, Abraminidin," shrieked a shrill voice, "come
from your dungeon at once. I have the Prince a prisoner. Come if you
Would win your battle with him." / .
The giant heard and acted quickly. He threw open the dungeon
door and ran to the assistance of the little woman.
Atoll, he said, at last we will win."
"Atoll." The Prince knew the history of his father, and knew that
Atoll was a mighty Queen of magicians once, but that she was
changed by his mother, the Lady of the Black Robe, into stone. How
had she come here? The Prince fell under a stunning blow from the
remaining fist of the giant, who Avould have killed him, but Atoll
said:
"Give him to me. Revenge is sweet. His father wrought the
downfall' of my power. Let him be my slave, and I will restore to
you your lost band. Long the Lady of the Black Robe -'ill wait
for his home-coming; never will she see this little Prince again. All
the days he has traveled from home I have watched him. When he
entered the castle to-day, I, in the disguise of a small butterfly, flew
in through the open doorway. I Avatched the Prince and laughed
slyly as 1 thought out the way to make him my prisoner. He listened
tee' me and believed me, just as his father believed before him, in the
bitter days when the champions of the Lady of the Black Robe lived.
Now he is my slave. When you have taken him to the sea and placed
him upon a ship that you will find there, I will give you back a hand
to take the place of the one that you have lost. Never will he come
back to be a. danger to you. Ah. but he was strong, and but for the
magic art I used ho would still have won the day when my hands
were about his white neck."
Prince I Don't Care had now recovered his senses, but pretended
not to hear. He kept his eyes closed and listened. He heard Atoll
say thai she had been turned back from stone Into her own self by
Al Araaf in his youth. So the Prince knew that Al Araaf had been
his body.
Finally one morning Mr. Bruin said
to his wife: "I wonder what is the
matter with Mr. Fox. He has not been
seen by any one for quite a while.
"I don't know, I'm sure," answered

his enemy long before the meeting in the Castle of Al Kabo. ; ' ~
Abraminidin put chains on the Prince and took him on one
shoulder and carried him to the seashore and there found a ship
manned by clack dwarfs, old, wrinkled and ugly. The dwarfs set up
a loud shout as the Prince was put upon the deck of their vessel.
Th 11 Atoll, their Queen, came and the vessel put to sea. Prince I
Don't Care, peeping slyly from his nearly closed eyelids, saAv that
the ship had ii" sails, and that she was drawn by something in the
water, to which was fastened a cable woven of the long hair of
thousands of little children. There Avas black hair, and brown and
yellow- hair, curls and braids with faded ribbons upon them; some of
the strands of the cable were made of the hair of little Indian boys
and girls, who had once played on the prairies and the great moun
tains. - .. "- '
As the Prince looked he saw something crawling on' the deck. It
was the Spinning Spider, who had long wanted to see the world, and
had taken this chance to sail abroad.
When night came on and the sailors had gone below, all except
one, who stood at the bow of the vessel to watch for land, the Spin
ning Spider said to the Prince: "Alas, poor Prince, I am sorry for
you, for you can never escape from the chains, that hold you. I wish
that I could help you." ..~'i7 -.
"Don't trouble about me." answered the Prince, kindly, "for I
am doing very well. It is true that 1 am in chains, and that I cannot
well move, but I don't care. If you are my friend there is a way to
help me. You may yet have the castle that I promised to you. Now,
listen, I have a piece of the Black Robe on the hilt of my sword,
which lies on the deck. That will help us much if you will do as I
command. Will you be my friend?"
Thus questioned by the Prince, the Spinning Spider said that he
would die for the Prince if necessary.
"Very well," said the Prince, "and thank you kindly. As you wove
the threads together the last time, you must know how to get them
apart easily. Pull out all the threads, one by one. and, in the dark
ness, while all the sailors are aAvay, weave the threads into the cables
of hair that draAv the ship. When you have finished your task come
to me."- _:.'.:-'-
So the Spinning Spider toiled as he had never tolled before and
wove his strands into the cable. He d! ' not dare to weave far from
the ship lest a wave should drown him while he worked.
"Very well," said the Prince, when the Spinning Spider came for
instructions. "Now pull out all the hairs of children .from the cable
where the strand is made of the Black Robe. Work hard and come to
me. We have only this night in which to work. I heard Atoll say
that Aye would land early to-morrow."
When the Spinning Spider had finished hia neAV task he came
to the Prince once more.
"Drop the hairs of children into the sea, one by one, and see what
will come of it."
Black hair and auburn, . yellow hair and brown, fell into the
Waves or was blown about by the wind, far and wide. Instantly
the- wind began to rise and the gales piled the surface of the water
into great waves, over which the ship went slowly and heavily.
"What does this mean?" asked the Spinning Spider of the Prince.
"The ship has been made by Atoll to go by magic. The cable is
fastened to monsters who have no will but to obey. The direction in
which the ship must be drawn has been told by Atoll. When you
wove into the cable of hair of children the threads from the Black
Robe, the power to steer the vessel came to me. I am going to that
part of the sea where the gales blow forever, there to wreck the
ship. Atoll cannot stop me, for the monsters who are fastened to
the .able- will haA-e to "bey me while the strand in the cable made
from the Black Robe holds together."
Atoll, seeing the waves .which threatened to sink the ship, ran to
the deck. She found that her magic would not change the course of
the vessel.
his wife; "let's go arid see."
So' they went] and when they arrived
at Foxey's home they knocked very
hard, but couldn't get in. Again they
knocked, but all in vain.
Then they went right in. What met
but the Roll of Honor shows that they

"Dear Prince," she said, coaxingly and deceitfully., in her softest
A'oice, "I fear that I have made a mistake. Let me be your friend."
"Madam," said the Prince, "I have a duty to perform."
"And what is your duty?" 'â â _
"I promised to rid the land of my Kin;; of the cruel giants. You
came and have made me a prisoner. Your friendship would be shown
better by having these chains taken from my hands and feet. Unless
you give me freedom the ship will go on to â "
"To what?" interrupted Atoll.
"To certain wreck. A toll, I know the history of my people. I
know that you have brought many troubles upon my father's king
dom. You are completely in my power, while I am still a prisoner.
We are nearing a sea where the reefs of jagged rock will tear this
ship into fragments. You and your crew will be miserably drowned.
There will be an end to your magic Avith you."
Atoll's lips curled. "You think that lam afraid. Go on to wreck,
since you will perish with us. When the ship goes down your chains
will drag you below the waves. What, then, will become of your
promise to kill all the giants?"
"It is true," said the Prince, "that the chains will drag me down.
Well, I don't care."
The ship rushed on. The crew begged of Atoll to set the Prince
free, but she answered, "No." Higher and higher rose the Avaters,
until the black waves loomed far above the doomed craft. On all
sides were jagged rocks and desolate islands. From clouds that were
as black as ink the lightning flashed and the boom of heavy thunder
jarred the sea. Then there was an awful crash. Atoll, too proud
to yield, standing proudly erect, smiled scornfully as her ship struck
on the rocks. Its many seams were opened and the roaring waters
rushed in. The sides of the ship were burst asunder. The crew were
scattered amid the waxes. Some sank at once. Some tried to save
themselves by swimming, but in vain. With parting shrieks they dis
appeared from view.
Atoll did not wait for the ship to founder. While the keel
trembled with the shock of running upon the rocks, she leaped boldly
into the waves, her arms folded, a smile on her lips. She sank, still
smiling. The next dark wave that rolled over the spot buried her,
ami she was seen no more. ..
What good fortune saved Prince I Don't Care? When the vessel
was broken to pieces he was chained to the deck. Thus he was on
a raft, upon which he floated to an island. Half drowned, but un
conquered, the Prince clung to a rock above the waves. He pounded
the lock that held the chain upon the flinty surface until it was broken.
Hurrah! Ills hands were free Upon his hands and knees he crawled
up farther on the island. At a distance he saw a house. To this he
wearily dragged himself. There was no one in the house. He entered
and found a file. With this he released his feet. By the shore he
saw a boat drawn up above the high water mark. He found food
in the house. That night he slept upon the island. The next day, the
waves going down, he entered into the boat and set sail.
In his garden, Abraminidin was walking. He AA*as happy, for he
thought that all of his troubles Were ended. "It is well that I am rid
of Prince I Don't Care," he said. V. _Â»
He turned, only to see the Prince, who had fitted an arrow to his
bow and was taking careful aim at the giant.
Swiftly sped the arrow. The giant, Abraminidin, fell, pierced
through with the arrow. So ended he.
Thus ends the story that Omar, the son of Mustapha. the camel
driver, placed in the chest in Arabia. D. H. W.
So ended the career of Foxey Fox.
Moral: Foxey Fox came to his un
timely end by talking Miss Wolf to
sleep. All young men take warning
and leave while it is yet time to say
good evening, and not good morning.

ONCE upon a time there were two
little girls living on a farm and
their names were Agnes and
Emma. Agnes was 14 and Emma
was 12. One day they started
out to go to the lake and pick wild
flowers. They took some lunch and
their big dog Sport went, too. They
were there about an hour when they
thought they would have lunch. They
sat down and were about through
when Emma saw a pretty yellow water
lily on the other side of the lake. She
said she must have it and started out
to get it. Agnes followed her, and
Sport went along, too. Emma bent
down to get the lilies and lost her bal
ance and fell in the water. Sport quick
as a flash jumped in after her and was
determined to save her. She had just
risen for the last time when Sport
grabbed her and swam as fast as he
could to the shore. He jumped out of
the writer and laid her on the sand and
began to wag his tail. Agnes waited a
few minutes, and then Emma said: "I
am all right." Then the flower-pickers
started home, for Emma needed some
dry clothes. Their mother wondered
what Avas the matter, and when the
girls told her she thought of how brave
Sport was, and put her arms around
Sport's neck and cried. Sport was al
ways treated kindly after that.

twenty-rtv< degrees were recognized, but i
with the organization of the mother su
preme council there was an addition to
the rite of eight more degrees, so as to
make the thirty-third degree, and not the
twentv-iifth. the summit of the Scottish i
rite. These degrees were at tirst divided !
Into seven sections, each being under an
appropriate jurisdiction, but In later years! .
the division was reduced to five by com
bining certain degrees.
The first of these is the Symbolic Lodge
with its three degrees of Entered Appren
tice Fellow Craft and Master Mason,
which in the Scottish Kit.- are not con- .
ferred In the i'nited States, England, !
Scotland and Ireland, because the Su- ;
preme Councils of the rite have refrained
from exercising fiction through their
respect for the older authority in these
countries of the (fork Rite.
Starting with the fourth degree comes
the Lodge of Perfection, with eleven de- ;
grees: Secret Master (4). Perfect Master
to). Intimate Secretary (ti). Provost and
Judge- vi. Intendent of the Building (8),
Elect of the Nine (91, Elect of the Fifteen
(10). Sublime Knight Elect of the Twelve
tin Grand Master Architect (12), Knight
of the Ninth Arch or Royal Arch of
Solomon (13), Grand Elect, Perfect and
Sublime Mason (14). â¢
Then follows the Chapter of lose Croix '
with four degrees; Knight of the East
U3). Prince oi Jerusalem (16); Knight of
the East and AVcs. ..). Sovereign Prince
Rose Croix (IS.. '. -'Vw'
The next progressive section is the
Council of Kadosh. with eleven degrees;
Grand Pontiff (19). Grand Master of Sym
bolical Lodges . (20 >. Patriarch Noachite
or Prussian Knight tint. <* Knight of the
Royal Ax or Prince of Libanus (22). Chief
cf the Tabernacle (2o). Prince of the Tab- I
ernacle (24); Knight of the Brazen Serpent j
(25) Prince of Mercy (2fi); Knight Com- j
mander of thÂ« Temple (27). Knight of the
Sun of Prince Adept (28); Grand Scottish
Knight of Si Andrew (29). Knight of Ka
dosh also called Grand Elect Knight, K. |
H. or Knight of the Black and W hite j
The - next is the Consistory of Sublime
Princes of the Royal Secret with but two I
degrees: Grand Inspector Inquisitor Com
mander (111). Sublime Prince of the Royal
Secret (32); _, . . . â¢ _. â¢
And the finale is the division which is
the pinnacle of Masonry and that is the
Supreme Council, with Its solitary degree
of Sovereign Grand Inspector General (33):
â¢ The Scottish Rite has its headquarters .
in the city of Washington; D. C, in the
House ofjthe Supreme Council of the
thirty-third degree, at the corner of Third
and E streets, northwest, with entrance
at 433 Third street In this building are
the offices of Judge Thomas 11. Caswell
of San Francisco, who by reason of being
the head of the Mother Supreme Council
of the world is not only the highest officer
of the Masonic fraternity in the United
States, as already announced, but is the
ranking Masonic dignitary of the entire
world, iui honor previously held only by
General Albert Pike. Jam. <;. Batchelor
and Phillip . '. Tucker. Judge Caswell is
proud of that honor, but he is still proud
er that the choice of holding that exalted
office fell to a resident of San Francisco.
The Supreme Council, of which he Is the
head, and In which he holds a life tenure,
embraces all that territory south of the
Ohio and west of the Mississippi. 'It in
cludes within its territ -rial limits the- Ha
waiian Islands. Japan and the Philippine
Island,-. The other jurisdiction in the
United States Is known as the northern
jurisdiction and is under the control of a
Supreme Council, with Hi nry I* Palmer
of Wisconsin as the M. P. Sovereign
Grand Comander. In that jurisdiction the ,
officers hold office only for three years.
These councils are on relations of amity
with the Supreme Councils of France,
England, Scotland. Ireland, Belgium,
Brazil, the Argentine Republic, Uruguay,
Peru, Portugal, Italy, Mexico, Colombia,
Chile, Central America. Greece. Canada, : .
Cuba, Switzerland, Egypt, Tunis and
Spain. â¢â¢: â  *"*
The southern jurisdiction is in a most ,
prosperous condition and has a member
ship of about 40.0(10. The House of the
Temple of the Supreme Council in th.
city of Washington is a three-story struc- i
ture that is so plain that there cannot be
claimed for it any architectural beauty,
but what is lacking in exterior appear
ances is made up by the interior arrange
ments. Judge Caswell In speaking of the
Temple, as it is generally designated, said
a few days since: "The building at this
.'time is not as it appears in the picture,"
as he pointed to a photographic view on
one of the walls "I his office, "for it is

thority to acquire two buildings adjoin
ing and entered into a contract to make
an addition to the main building, so as
to give room for the splendid collection
of curios that we own and which has a
value of not less than 130.000, but it has
been kept stowed away in boxes in the
basement. In the garret and in every
place where an unopened box could be
stored. In the addition there will be a
museum 43x65 feet, in which can be dis
played in a most advantageous manner
all the rare and wonderful things that
belong to the Supreme Council.
"We also have a most magnificent
library of more than 90.000 volumes, an.l
out of that number we have but 1000
novels. These, however, are the very
best. We have a large number of the
finest and rarest books that are to lee
found in any library In the world. There
are a number of books worth more than
$t>Â»x_)_ ii volume. Some of these are not to
be found in the Congressional Library
and efforts have been made to secure
them for it. but they are not for sale.
We have books in all languages and an
unlimited umber of scientific works. < it'
course we have a good collection of works
on Masonry, but those works form but a
small fraction of the whole. When the
late General Albert Pike died he left us
his magnificent library, and it is a valu
able one. It contains fifty of his own
publications, including a number of Ma-'
sonic works. He was a man for whom I
had the greatest liking. I formed his ac

more attractions for you and you could
