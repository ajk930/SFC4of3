SAN QUENTIN PRISON. May 16.
On a cct in the hospital depart
ment lies Guard James McDonald
of San Rafael, with his life slowly
ebbing, as the result of seven ghastly
â wounds inflicted at 7:45 o'clock this
morning with a dirk wielded by a
murderous convict. It is the opinion
of Dr. Lawlor, the prison physician,
that McDonald's chances of living are
about one in a thousand, and he may
be dead before the sun arises again.

Walter Ross, a fellow prisoner, at Fol-
F'>m a yar ago, a crime for whi'-h he

a Thf time, the place, the motive and the
attendant circumstances all combine
to form a tale of murdr-r fiendish in
the extreme, a tal^ fully justifying the
assertion of Warden Aull at thÂ» time
Tiheinu-r escaped th" noose for the
murder of Ross that the day would
â  when somebody would have cause
for regret that the prisoner was dealt
with so lightly.
The jutemill is divided into two sec
tions and the in<-n in each have a
separate lavatory. Those in the east
rm section are permitted to visit only
the lavatory in the building, while
those working in the western section
mak* use of one about thirty feet from
the western entrance. The prisoners
doing duty in th^ western section are
regarded as favored because their lava
tory is so constructed that a whiff or

th" occasion of every visit.
yesterday < >ppenheimor, who was
stationed 'it breaker No. 4 in the east
ern section, was discovered in the out-
Fide lavatory by Guard McDonald ami
made to return to work. His violation
of The rule was reported to chief
Leahy, but when <>ppr>nheimer was
.Â«â¢ immoned to appear before that official
he vigorously denied that he was the
ted by McDonald. To-day
' â¢ pp^nheimer was missed from his post
>and again found in the forbidden spot
icDoaald. Taking him by the arm
the guard started back to the jutemill,
Baying as they went:
"You denied that I caught you yes
S
terday and I intend to prove I was
rieht this time."
The convict huns back and ha<l to be
dragged along until the two weiv just
inside the doorway of the mill, where
Michael Powers, the guard on the wall.
could not use his gun. Then Oppen
hejnier sprang on McDonald without a
word and drawing an eight-inch dirk
â  F prison manufacture sank it Into th.>
guard's bosom. Weakened by the shock,
the victim turned and feebly attempted
grapple with his murderous assail
ant. Placing his ;:;::! around McDon
r,>--k ( ippÂ»Tih.-iin<'i- stabbed him
again In the region of the heart. At
this -blow the guard sank to one knee,
while the convict kept up his thrusts.
The scene was witnessed by another
convict, who "ran up to Guard Samuel
Yoho and told him that on< <â ;" the
guards was being killed. Y/oho turned
in time to see McDonald catch hold of
the blade "f the knife, which was
jerked through his hand, nearly, si
ing that member from the wrist. Clear
ing the fifty feet of space between him
and th* 1 terrible scf-n^ as fast as he
could, Vnho was forced to witness the
knife again descr-nd and pierce Mc-
Donald's body under the left arm.
With <>ne hlow from his heavy cane
across thr> side of the head Yoho felled
Oppenhelmer to the floor in an insen
sible condition. lip stageored a few feet
re falling and was followed by
Vnho, vhosp desire was to lay hands
on th^ knife. it was dropped and
picked up by a convict, several having
rushed to the vicinity of the struggle,
and was found in the evening in the
lavatory by a guard.
In the meantime McDonald had man
aged to regain his feet, and with up
lifted cane rushed at Oppenheimer.
Yoho held him and said. "Don't hit
him. Jim; I have given him all he can
stand."
chief Leahy was noting, and under
the direction of Warden Hale had Op
penheimer placed in the dungeon. As-
slated- by Yoho and Leahy, the injured
man walked to the hospital and Dr.
Lawlor was hastily Bummoned. He
found seven wounds. There vere two
in the breast, which had piÂ«n-ed the
lung tissue and the wind whistled from
them at every breath. Another fearful
wound was under the left Bhottlder. A
deep wound had .been made in tho left
thigh, and one of a shallower nature in
the left calf, while the fingers of the
left band were nearly severed.
The wounds were dressed and a
strengthening potion given McDonald,
who was soon able to receive the last
rites of his church from Roy. Father
Sheehy. who had been summoned from
San Rafael by Captain Rirlem. Then
Mr?. McDonald and the three little
children of the wounded man were ad
mitted to see him, but the poor woman
was hysterical and had to bo excluded.
As she was assisted to leave the hos
pital by her friends, weeping and moan

and crying in affright, it made a scene

that brought the tears to the eyes of
the most hardened witness.
McDonald 'B statement of the affair.
which was substantially as given in the
foregoing:, was taken by District At
â  Mclsaac and afterward signed.
< tppenheimer was then brought in by
of armed guards and Identified by
the dying man.
"Yes. that's the man who stabbed
me." he exclaimed, "and I hopp he'll
hang."
Oppehhelraer scowled in a forbidding
manner, refused to say anything and
was led back to the dungeon.
Dr. Lawlor gave it as his belief that
it will bp a miracle if McDonald is alive
to-morrow at noon. The unfortunate
sufferer was resting easy this evening,
hut is growing weaker all the time. If
! he dies Oppenheimer will surely hang,
but in case he recovers his brutal as
sassin can only be placed in the "soli
tary" cell and kept there at the discre
tion of thp Warden. It, is asserted on
1 all sides that in case McDonald fails to

"I had all I could do to control my
self sufficiently to keep from hitting
< ipi>f-nhpimer two or three times and
settling him," said Guard Yoho this
evening. "The fiendish grin on Oppen
heimei a fa< â¢â  as he drew the knife
through that defenseless man's fingers
and saw his hand drop to his side with

hard the smile congealed on his face
and did not leave it until he had re

â  ippenheimer is one of the most des
te and thoroughly distrusted con
victs at San Quentin. Though only 30
years old his career of crime has been
lengthy. It began in San Francisco
when a boy employed by the American
District Telegraph Company as -mes
senger. In May, 1592, he and a com
panion named Lawless robbed John
Monahan, another messenger boy em
ployed in the office at 533 Sutter street,
and because they got only 85 cents
nearly beat Monahan to death. Oppen
heimer was sent to the House of Cor
rection for eighteen months for his
crime, and three years later was con
victed of robbery in Alameda, and with
a companion named Barry Harland
was sent to Folsom prison for fifty
years.
On September 30, isns. he stabbed a
convict named "Walter Ross to death
because he believed the latter's brother
had been istrumental in his conviction
on the robbery charge. He received a
life sentence on conviction, his neck be
ir.^r sa â¢>â¢-(! by the testimony of a number
of his gang that Ross was the assail
ant. He was removed to San Quentin
on February 1 and has sinco proved a
savage and Intractable prisoner.
QUEEN VICTORIA IS
NOW ALMOST BLIND
Oculist Decides That an Operation
Must Be Performed on Her
Kight Eye.
NEW YORK. May 16.â A cable to the
Journal says: Queen Victoria Is almost
blind. She has completely lost the sight
of her left eye, ami that of the right eye
Is nearly obscured by a cataract. This
alarming condition of the Queen's eyes
has been discovered by Dr. Pagenstecher,
the famous German oculist, lie has ad
vised an immediate operation upon the
Queen's right eye. An operation is said
to be the only thing that can prevent
total blindness.
That Queen Victoria has been made to
appreciate the gravity of her condition is
evident from the fact that she wore spec
tacles yesterday while, driving at Ken
sington. It Is contrary to the* custom of
the Queen to appear in spectacles, and the
sight of them caused : considerable com
ment among those in state . attendance
upon her. Now. as Dr. . Pagenstecher has
so strongly advised an operation, it is be
lieved that it may be accomplished with
out serious results. He has assured the
.royal family he would not have advised it
unless convinced that it would be per
formed successfully.

EX-GOVERNOR BOUTWELL
SCORES M'KINLEY
BOSTON, May 16.â Ex-Governor
Boutwell, president of the Anti-imper
ialistic League, was the chief speaker
at the meeting of the league here to
day. Mr. Boutwell denied that the
league was engaged in improper deal
ings with the army In the Philippines.
"'lt is the purpose of the league," he
said, "to bring the army out of the
Philippines by the quiet influence of
the American people at home, acting
through the ordinary channels of in
tercourse and communication; but,
failing in that effort, as fail we
may, we propose to so act as to
summon the army from the Phiiip
plnes by the authority of the votes of
the American people and without
thought of the consequences to men,
to the administration, to political par
ties or to questions of domestic con
cern.
"If the opinion of one person upon the
question of whether the President of
the United States or Aguinaldo is in
the right is of any value to the advo
cates of imperialism, I am prepared to
make answer. The President assorts
the right to govern others, a right
which has never been possessed law
fully by any one, and which has ever
been exercised through fear, fraud,
force and war.
"As between Aguinaldo and the Pres
ident, Aginaldo is in the right and the
President is in the wrong.
"Aguinaldo can only bring the war
to an end by the surrender of all right
to self-government in himself and in
his people and by a recognition of the
right in the President to govern and
to tax .R.000.0n0 of Filipinos in whatever
manner shall to him seem expedient."
Taking up Secretary Long's intima
tion that the Philippines might be given
a government similar to that at the
Territories of the United States, Mr.
Boutwell enumerated some of the priv
lleges which Territories enjoy and ask.'d
what the reply of the American citi
zens would be to a proposition to en
dow 5.00n.000 (rf Malays and their pos
terity through all time with a right of
< onipotitinn and equality?
Mr. Boutwell held that the iniquity
of imperialism was bearing a harvest
of evil in many quarters, in support of
which he cited recent events in Samoa
and Hawaii. The only possibility now
for peaceful conditions in the Philip
pines, he declared, was the abanden
mr-nt of the claim to jurisdiction and
tendering all aid without positive obli
gation in the establishment of an inde
pendent government.
The league adopted a resolution de
claring that the "punishment of our
criminal aggression against this brave,
betrayed a d unfortunate people is al
ready evident in the ominous usurpa
tion of illegal powers by the President,
in unjustifiable censorship of the press
and in the threat of prosecution for
treason of an eminent and patriotic
citizen who was acting strictly within
his legal rights."
Another resolution protests against
"this attempt to degrade a great re
public into a great empire, to destroy
Its moral leadership of the world, and
to make it succumb to ideas and prin
ciples which it was born to oppose.

Too Much Education Is Not

The New York Millionaire Says
Boys Should Begin to
Work Earlier.
fporial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May lfi.â Russell Sage
said to-day that he had read carefully
the speech of Collis P. Huntington in
which he declared that the masses were
being over-educated, and that he
thoroughly agreed with the San Fran
cisco millionaire's sentiments.
"Mr. Huntingdon's speech is full of
common sense from start to finish."
said Mr. Sagp. "I am in favor of edu
cation just as much as anybody. I
have given money to colleges, but I
don't believe In over-education, mind
you.
"I quit school and went into business
at eighteen. T have done very well. I
think that a y.iung man should be able
to start in his life work by the time he
is eighteen or nineteen years old. Life
is too short for the period from four
teen to twenty-one years of age, as
Mr. Huntington says, to be used up in
filling the mind with mere book knowl
edge.
"If young men could only get the
Idea that business life is just as hon
orable and respectable as professional
life more of our bright boys would go
into business. To make it short. I be
lieve a young man should be thorough
ly educated in the business he intends
to follow, rather than have general and
surface knowledge of a great many
things. These are the days of special
ties, and unless the machinist and en
gineer or banker knows his business
well he will not succeed. Young men
ought to be able to see, too, that a per
son who understands the mechanical
department of a big business can com
mand a better salary than a mere clerk
or bookkeeper. There are openings for
the most brilliant minds in the gigantic
business world of this country and the
sooner our young men recognize it and
act accordingly the better it will be for
them."

HAVANA. May 16.â The situation of
affairs here is much clearer. The Cu
ban leaders are reconciled to the ar
rangement for the surrender of arms
to the civil authorities, but still believe
that all the officers are entitled to any
residue remaining from the $3,000,000
grant. They will make no objection on
these grounds, but will issue notice to
their soldiers to Rive up their arms,
when ordered by General Brooke, to
the civil authorities, as recommended
by the assembly.
General Gomez worked on his mani
festo all day and will issue it to-mor
row. He told me to-night that it would
contain advice to the soldiers to give
up their arms to the Mayors and go to
work. The soldiers will probably be
allowed to give up their arms in a
body and afterward will receive their
money.
General Brooke's new order drawn
up to-day revokes the previous distri
bution order and appoints American
commissioners only. Lieutenant Col
onel Rafferty will have charge of pay
ing the Fourth Corps of the Cuban
army in Santa Clara and Matanzas;
Colonel Randall will . pay the Fifth
Corps in Havana and Matanzas, and
Colonel Bisbee will have charge of the
Sixth Corps in Pinar del Rio. The
commissioners are instructed to con
sult with the civil authorities of these
districts and arrange for reserving
arms. The Mayors are instructed that
where the arms exceed five hundred
stands they shall appoint Cuban sol
diers as armorers. American soldiers
will accompany the commissioners in
the distribution.
The order says nothing in regard to
paying officers, but the understanding
between Brooke and Gomez is that
needy officers shall receive the residue.
The commissioners will begin their
work immediately.
Lawyer Terrill Arraigned.
SAN JOSE. May If,.â Attorney S. B.
Terrill. who was recently extradited from
Arizona on a charge that he) embezzled
$300 from the Christopher Faull estate,
! was before Judge Lorigan this morning
to plead to indictments of embezzlement
and forgery returned by the Grand Jury.
These two charges are based on allega
tions that Terrill fleeced Mrs. Clara A.
Fread out of $3<X> by means of a bogus
mortgage. The point was raised that the
proceedings of the Grand Jury were ir
regular, but this was overruled. A mo
tion was made that the indictments be set
aside on the ground that Terrill had not
been served with a copy or arraigned on
the charge. This will be argued on
I Wednesday.

PRETORIA, May 16.â Eight offi
cers formerly in the British army
have been arrested at Johannes
burp, charged with high treason.
The arrest has caused intense
excitement here. The prisoners were
brought to Pretoria by special train
and after they had been lodged in jail
they were visited by the British diplo
matic agent.
The arrests were effected by a de
tective who joined the movement
which, it is asserted, was for the pur
pose of enrolling men in order to cause
an outbreak of rebellion.
The officers arrested are Captain Pat
terson, formerty of the Lancers; Col
onel R. F. Nicholls, Lieutenant J.
Tremlott, Lieutenant C. A. Ellis, lately
a private detective at Johannesburg;
Lieutenant John Allen Mitchell, for
merly of the Horse Artillery; former
Sergeants J. Fries, R. P. Hooper and
Nichols. None of them have been in
the employ of the British South African
Chartered Company.
It is said that the Commissioner of
Police, vho had the affair in hand, had
been wo -king up the case four months.
Mr. Beatty, the detective who effected
the arrests, received his instructions
last week and secured the necessary
warrants yesterday.
The executive council of the Trans
vaal is sitting in secret session this
evening considering the arrests, ajid
several additional warrants have been
issued.
It is asserted that the officers already
arrested were also preparing to organ
ize a corps in Natal, the British colony
between the Orange Free State and the
Indian Ocean, to assist the projected
movement at Johannesburg.
The charge a.eainst the prisoners is
that, while staying in the Rand pri
vately, they are really engaged in en
listing men for the purpose of rebel
lion when they were ready to give the
signal.
It is said that the enlistment roster
included 2000 men and that a number
of incriminating documents were found
at the time the arrests were made.
The British Agent and Charge d'Af
faires, Cunningham Green, had an in
terview with President Kruger this af
ternoon and expressed regret that men
who had worn the Queen's uniform
should be concerned in such a move
ment.
President Kruger replied that he
would not believe the prisoners were
British officers until it has been proved,
adding that he hoped the affair would
not interfere with 'he proposed meet
ing between himself anrf Sir Alfred Mil
ner, Governor of Cape Colony and Brit
ish High Commissioner for South
Africa.
SALISBURY AFFECTS
OFFICIAL IGNORANCE
LONDON, May 16.â The arrests at
Johannesburg- are probably connected
with the mysterious dispatch received
at Johannesburg from Pretoria on May
12 saying a special train fully equipped
with Boer artillerymen, guns and a
searchlight apparatus was being held
in readiness at the capital of the Trans
vaal. The statement was then declared
without significance, but to-day's news
throws a more serious light on the
movement and it is certain there will
be a great sensation in London when
the news of the arrests becomes gen
erally known.
The afternoon newspapers to-day
print special dispatches from Cape
Town saying eight men have been ar
rested at Johannesburg and have been
taken to Pretoria. The Government of
the Colony, it further appears, is con
sidering the matter secretly. The news
has caused great excitement through
out South Africa. .

They then staked out all the law allowed

some excitement.

EPIDEMIC HAS
RUN ITS COURSE
Glen Ellen Invalids Are
Convalescing.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SONOMA. May 16.â The measles ppi
' demlc at the Home for Feeble-Mindeu
<hildren at Glen fillen has been
1 checked. The disease was brought to
the home by a visitor from Stanislaus
'â  County some time in March. Owing to
; the crowded condition of the home
nothing could be done but let the dis
j ease run its course, there being no hos
pital accommodations provided for this
; institution. The home is intended to
; accommodate only 4QO, but at the out
! break of the malady it was carinpr for
â ">". patients. The dormitories were bo
\ crowded that the gr-rms of disease
could spread from one bed t" the next.
Visitors to the home were denied ad
mittance, as were some of the patients
who had been off on a vacation. School
was .suspended and will remain so for
â  about two months longer. During tho
! epidemic teachers turned nurses and
worked with a will. When at its worst
ninety cases were being cared for in
one day. Pome of the unfortunates had
, had measles before, about twelve years
ago.
No new patients will b^' admitted or
i old ones taken back for at least six
weeks more. In an interview with Dr.
j Osborne he said:
"Had the previous Legislature made
necessary appropriations the home
could have been enlarged and we would
have been prepared for such emergen
cies.' the present time I have 300
applicants clamoring for admission, but
am unable to properly care for those
we now have. We expect to give the
building a thorough cleaning and dis
infect everything as* soon as the
measles are cured. During this epi
demic we had at least 250^cases and not
a single death."
Mrs. Osborne, who assists the doctor
in his duties about the Home for Feeble-
Minded Children, could not say enough
in praise of the teachers and others
! who so willingly assisted as nurses. In
referring to those who are connected
with the institution she said all worked
together as if belonging to one large
family. Not a dissenting voice was
heard.
SEVENTH DOCUMENT IN
DREYFUS CASE MISSING
NEW YORK. May I.â A Paris cable
pram to the Sun says: The Figaro this
morning continues its analysis of the se
cret dossier in the Dreyfus case, which
consisted of seven documents, six of
which were as applicable to the others as
they were to Dreyfus. The seventh, the
letter alleged to have been written by
Emperor "William to Dreyfus, has van
ished. This letter probably originated in
Colonel Henry's cunning brain and akill
ful hand.
The dossier shown to the Dreyfus
judges also contained Dv Paty de Clam's
commentary, which has since been re
moved. The original had been destroyed
by order of General Mercier, but a copy
was preserved, although its destruction
was ordered. It was the copy that was
shown to the judges. The Figaro demon
strates the invalidity of every document
that was secretly used against Dreyfus.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 17, 1809.
FRIGHTFUL
DEATH OF AN
ENGLISH EARL
Lord Straflford Seemingly
Threw Himself Before a
Fast Express Train.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, l>y James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, May 16.â The Earl of
Strafford, who was recently married in
New York to .Mrs. Colgate, met sud
den death this evening by falling un
der the fast express train on the Great
Northern Railway. Lord Strafford left
his town house in St. James Square
this morning apparently in the best of
health. This evening at about 8 o'clock
he was standing on the platform of
Potter's Bar Station, just this side of
Hatfleld. Those who saw him on th â 
platform did not notice anything par
ticularly in his behavior. He was pac
ing up and down waiting for a local
train.
As the fast express, which does not
stop at Potter's Bar, was seen ap
proaching Lord Strafford, who was
standing near the edge of the platform,
suddenly fell forward on the rails
in front of the flying train. Absolutely
nothing could be done to rescue him,
and the horrified onlookers saw the
massive engine rush over his prostrate
body. When the train had passed rail
way servants rushed down on the line
and found that his head had been com
pletely severed from his body.
Inquiries at his lordship's town house
to-night elicited nothing further than
the statement that, so far as known.
Lord Strafford was in excellent health
and had no present trouble on his mind.
It will be remembered' that Lord
Strafford, while on duty as equerry to
the Queen at Windsor, in the early
part of March, was suddenly prostrated
by what the physicians diagnosed as
acute influenza, but he had recovered
perfect health.

the failure of the crop last year and tho

ELIXIR OF LIFE
FROM THE GOAT
The Secret of Eternal
Youth.
Special Dispatch to The Tall.
NEW Yi>KK. May 16.â A Chicago spe
cial to the Herald says: The elixir of
life sought by explorers and philosophers
from Ponce de Leon to Brown-Sequard
has at last been found, if the expecta
tions of a physician from Green City, Mo.,
alized. This doctor's name is B. F.
Roberts, .-::;<! so thoroughly has he Im
pressed Chicago physicians who hay.> ex
perimented with his elixir that several
have undertaken extensive experiments
with the new panacea.
On his farm near Oreen City Dr. Rob
erts lihs raised a large herd of goats, and
it is from theÃfc prosaic animals that the
fluid of youth is to be secured. "Life
cells" from the lymphatic glands of the
goats are removed with great care and
mi served from all infection. The preser
vation of these cells and The maintenance
of life In them form the most valuable
feature of Dr. Roberts' method.
These life cells are transplanted to the
human body by hypodermic injections.
The resuits, according to Dr. Roberts
and his assistants, have been interesting
in the extreme and would seem to justify
the claim that old age may be postponed
and the disorders of senility avoided by
the use of the lymph.
In an institution to be established in
Chicago further experiments will be
made. Dr. Alexander ('. Wiener assisted
Dr. Roberts in some of the experiments
conducted in Chicago. "I do not like to
speak of anything of this kind." said he,
"because it Beems bo sensational that it
is likely to be misbelieved and may lead
to severe criticism by the profession. I
was associated with Dr. Roberts in his
experiments in this city and will carry
ori some more along the same lines."
"The tlrst case I saw treated by Dr.
Roberts impressed me greatly. The pa
tient was a man of over 64 years who had
for a long time been suffering from an
gina pectoris. After the injection of the
lymph lie lecovered. He has lost all
symptoms and shows remarkably in
cKiJsed strength.
"The reason for using the goat i<3 that
the goat is a healthy animal. Only young
goats have been used and Dr. Roberts has
a large herd near his home in Missouri
from which he secured the lymph with
which he has been experimenting for over
twenty years. He is a studious man, and
has certainly given us something new
and of far-reaching importance in his
methods of maintaining life in the lymph
cells after their removal from the ani
mals."
"So you think that this lymph actually
I prolongs life?" I asked.
"Yes." said Dr. Wieners. "I certainly
think so from the results I have seen."
"How long would one treatment have
effect?"
"I should say that one treatment mi?ht
retain its effect perhaps ten years and
that at the end of that time the iniec
i tion might be repeated with success."
DISCOVERS STRANGE
TRIBES IN FORMOSA
Mountain Climber Stoepel Witnesses
a Cannibal Feast on Mount
Morrison.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 16.â as
cent of Mount Morrison, the highest
mountain in Formosa, has been com
pleted at last, after many others have
failed, by K. T. Stoepel, the explorer of
the peak of Orizaba in Mexico and the
Mauna Klea and Mauna Lioa in Hawaii.
Mr. Stoepel succeeded, despite many hair
breadth escapes from wild animals and
aboriginal tribes and the excessive heat.
He has done a great deal for the better
knowledge of the island, the mountain,
the climate and the hunting.
On the mountain, near the summit, he
discovered a tribe of human beings that
had never seen the face of a white man,
and, possibly, had never seen a China
man. These people were of ferocious
aspect, extremely ugly, thin and entirely
naked. They were skull hunters evident
ly, and existed on the flesh of wild ani
mals and were not averse to human flesh.
While hiding In the underbrush near a
| noisy campfire of these people Mr. Stoe
pel was the unwilling witness of a can
nibal feast, but, fearing detection he did
i cot stay, long enough to .enable him to
of Indianapolis, at Sacramento. A tele
gram of fraternal greeting was sent to
th Gr ?- nd Lod &c at Washington.
â¢ The Knights of Pythias' Library Asso
ciation of San Francisco offered to donate
.v. the Grand Lodge all of its books and
other property in ihe library, 5000 vol
umes, on condition that the Grand Lodge
maintain the library in San Francisco,
Ine proposition was referred to a special
committee. A proposition was introduced
to make San Francisco the permanent
meeting place of the Grand Lodge. No
action was taken.
At Native Sons' Hall this evening the
Â£â¢ O- K. * X.. or Dramatic Order of
Knights of Kohrassan, had a ceremo
nial session. The annual pilgrimage to
Mecca was taken and many new pilgrims
had their feet blistered in crossing the
hot sands of the desert for the iirst time.

WATER TO IRRIGATE
THOUSANDS OF ACRES
STOCKTON, May IÂ«.â The farmers in
the country north of LodJ are much re
joiced over the prospect of an early opera
tion of the reconstructed Woodbridge
canal ByÃtem. For four years the ditches
have been dry. while millions of gallons
of water raced over the broken dam in
the Mokelumne River. First the company
went into the hands of a receiver, then
the creditors fought and it was not till
five months ago that a company of local
capitalists acquired the rights of the j
original projectors of the enterprise. Re- â¢
construction and repnir began at once, and ;
it is now announced that by the 20th inst. |
the company will be ready to irrigate the
first 1500 acres adjacent to the main ditch.
A thirty-six inch pipe is to be put into the
levee this week to convey water from the
new pumping plant to the ditch. The
company will increase its operations next
> ear. For the present the pumping plant
will not have to be operated, as there Is
4U feet of water running through the old
headgate. The Mokelumne River is being
swelled hourly by the melting snow in
the mountains, insuring an abundance of
water for the company.
The company is said to have plans in
view for a great irrigation system cover-
Ing the entire northern section of the
county. It was with that view that the
rights of the old company were acquired.
The old plant was almost a wreck and
the chief assets were the rights in the
Mokelumne River. The new company,
headed hy W. D. Buckley, is composed of
progressive business men who are en
tirely able to carry out their projects.
MAYOR VAN WYCK
SHOWS HIS TEMPER
NEW YORK. May 16.â Mayor Robert A.
Van Wyck was on the witness stand to
day before the Mazet investigating com
mittee. There was not much of note
about the Mayor's testimony, and only
on one occasion did he find reason to
make an outbreak. This was when he
was questioned by Counsel Moss of the
committee regarding the rumored connec
tion of a man "named Van Wyck with
a number of poolrooms." The Mayor be
came very angry at this and declared that
Mr. Moss had asked that question for the
purpose of insinuation. He demanded
that if any evidence was obtained to
prove any such connection It should' be
produced before the committee. He de
nied most emphatically that he had any
connectlon with any poolrooms whatso
ever or any other Illegal business. Mayor
Van Wyck asserted emphatically also that
he had never consulted with any one re
garding the appointments he had made.

SAN JOSE, May 16.â Thomas F. Mor
rison to-day tendered Ms resignation to
Mayor Martin as a member of the Police
and Fire Commission. A short time ago
he was elected to fill a vacancy in the
County Auditorship. This dual offlee
hnlding aroused a good deal of comment.
Only this morning the Republican Good
Government League had a committee be
fore Mayor Martin asking that Morrison
be ousted from the commission, and it is
said the Mayor was in accord with the
request, but declined to act hastily The
charter provides that a Police and Fire
Commissioner shall not be eligible for
any other office. Morrison's friends have
been urging him to hold on and test the
matter. Morrison, however, decided to re-
S 'fn ' his letter of resignation to Mayor
Martin Morrison said his attorney had
advised him he could retain the office, but
not wishing to arouse any friction he re

JAPAN WILL LEND
TROOPS TO CHINA.
Will Aid in Preventing
Partition.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, May 16.â According to news
received by the Empress of India. China
will resist further aggression by the pow
ers. The worm, it seems, has turned, and.
the disintegration of the Celectial empire
is to be allowed to continue no longer
without remonstrance from the Chinese.
The Italian demands at San Mun appear
to heve been the straw which' broke the
camel's back.
The Kobe Herald, copies of which were
received by the Empress, has a story of
the drawing of a secret treaty between
Japan and China whereby, in considera
tion of the settlement of some territory
at Fuchau upon Japan the island em
pire offers to bnd troops and ships to
China to aid her in resisting Germany
should the Teutons attempt to seize the
province of Shantung. The Kobe Herald
claims to have th. news of the drawing
of the treaty on Rood authority, but says
it cannot vouch for the accuracy of the
statement.
That China intends to resist the advance
of Germany in the north is shown by the
fact that recently orders were sent to thÂ«
Mandarins and Taotaos nf all ilisiric*^
and provinces, says 1 1 1 * â  Kni,,. paper, <^#
dering them to concentrate what fight**
Ins men they could ami prepare for war.
The arsenals have been ordered to push
forward the manufacture of aims and
ammunition with all hasto. A late edict
places Viceroy Liv in charge of the
troops.
The Chinese navy, also, according to
late reports which have reached thft
Herald, is getting ready for an emer
gency.
Trouble has occurred recently In Shan
tung and German missionaries have been,
ill treated. Germany is sending expedi
tions to punish the natives, burning vil
lages and gradually pushing her way in
ward, until very shortly she will hay*
possession of the whole province. It is
said continues the Herald, that the Ger
man plan is actually to establish a Ger
man kingdom there with Prince Henry aa
King, as previously was told in Peking
dispatches.

CONTROL OF TRANSPORTATION
THE SUBJECT.
Attorney Devlin Suggests That Or
chard Owners Organize a Re
frigerator Car Line of
Their Own.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, -May 16.â The com
mittee on transportation appointed by
the State Fruit Growers' Convention
which met in Fresno last year held a
session In the State Capitol this after
noon in response to a call from Chair
man K. I>. Stephens of Sacramento.
Stephens said to the committee that he
had called It together for the purpose
of considering the advisability of call-
Ing a mass-meeting of fruit growers
immediately. He said this action was
necessary owing to the fact that there
now but two refrigerator car com
panies In California, which had frozen
out all competitor.- and now sought
absolutely to a ntrol the green fruit
shipments of the State. He declared
that unless the growers organized to
protect themselves the refrigerator
car monopoly would have them entirely
at its mercy, would absorb all the
profits and in time own the orchards.
All of the members of the committee
were in accord with Stephens' view of
the case. \V. B. (Jester, a leading
grower of Piacer County and a member
of the transportation committee, de
clared that the immediate menacing
clanger arose from the fact that each
| of the refrigerator car lines was c n
trolled by a company engaged as a
dealer in California fruits.
Attorney Robert T. Devlin, who was
present as legal adviser of the commit
tee at the request of Chairman Steph
ens, said a corporation could be formed
of growers in such a manner that its
; stock would not pass into the hands of
outside parties seeking to control it.
11" said that all that was necessary,
primarily, was to allow no stock to be
i sold in the first instance to other than
growers and then to place the stock in
! escrow to trustees, with the under
standing that it was not to be trans
ferred for a given number of years. The
object of this advice was made
': when Stephens gave it as his opinion
that the remedy for the difficulty that
confronted the growers was for them
to organize a refrigerator car line of
their own.
A. H. Natzger, manager of the
Southern California Fruit Exchange,
i advised the growers to organize along
the line of the exchange which he rep
resented, and which had proved a
, beneficial to the orange growers of the
south.
H. P. Stabler of Tuba City, a member
of the committee, and others gave their
views as to how the organization of
the glowers should be effected, but this
is a matter that will be left to the
mass-meeting. A motion to call such
j a meeting was unanimously carried
! and it will be held in this city next
Tuesday, begririning at 11 a. m.
It is the opinion of the growers as- i
sembled here to-day that owing to the
danger that they believe confronts
them, there will at that time be formu
lated a plan of urbanization which will j
be carried out without delay.

PIUTES HOLD HIGH CARNIVAL
ON PYRAMID LAKE RESERVE
DYRAMID LAKE (Indian Reserva
tion), New, May 16.â This has been 1
"fandango" week among the Piutes.
The- tide of prosperity which has
swept the country seems to have reached
the Piute Indian, and he is celebrating
its advent, or return, and declares he is
doing wel! and having a rip-roaring good
time.
For weeks past the redskins of the
plains have been making elaborate prep
aratlona for and looking forward to the
great "Indian State Fair," as they now
tall it. or the "grand fandango," as it lms
been heretofore known. It opened here
last Saturday and continued throughout
the week. Just beyond the post trader's
store, outside and to the north of the
agency grounds, in about the deepest
Band that could be found in the vicinity,
the Piutes put up their teepes, wickiups
and temporary abiding-places of all kinds
and description, and on Saturday de
i lared the â â¢fair" open. It is essentially
a Piute affair, and this is their reserva
tion, but tribesmen from Walker River
and Pit River, the Bannocks. Western
Shoshones. Modocs, and almost every
other tribe of the plains were welcome
and most of them had representatives
it. The YVashoes were the notable
exception to this rule. They have no res
ervation, and considerable ill-feeling ex
ists between them and their nearest
neighbors, the Piutes; hence their al
most total exclusion from the festivities
of the reservation Indians.. As a prom
inent Piute aptly put it to-di.y:
"Washoe Injun heep dam no good. No
wantee lure."
But the Piute "400," together with about
2000 other ordinary, more or less dirty,
rather good-for-nothing, altogether lazy
Indians, were on hand and conspicuously
In evidence almost continually throughout
tin- week. It is probably the largest gath
ering and most extensive demonstration
the Piutes have had since their last war,
in 1860-61, when Major Ormsby, Captain
Storey and Lieutenant Meredith were de
feated and killed near the scene of the
!â¢:. sent fandango.
The festivities of the week consisted
princ Ipally of horse races, baseball and
football games, dances, numerous games
of chance, contests in feats of Btrength
and other games and contests strict
ly Piutian in character, like "Piute
poker" and "Nyuque." or the "stick
game," as some call it. The usual pro
gramme was about as follows: Com
mencing early in the forenoon, a horse
rac< or ball game; during the afternoon
another; throughout the day and until the
starts at night, numerous and di
versified games of chance, in which par
ties ol all squaws, all bucks or a con
gregation of both, lake part, on which
they wager anything and sometimes
everything they have, and around which
large crow, is gather to watch the sport;
between 8 and 9 o'clock at night the
dances start and continue usually until
daylight, all other games being for the
time suspended.
If one â  omefl to Pyramid Lake to learn
from thi Indians that State fairs or horse
may be successfully conducted
without the evil of the betting ring, he
will be most wo,. fully disappointed. The
Piute is. above everything else, a natural
born gambler. The Indians have no reg
ular bookmaker or pool seller and no
"touts" like they had at Ingleside to as
sist in robbing the public, but every Piute
has his choice and be backs it, and backs
It high, in many eases w r ith every cent he
has "ii â â¢r.rth.
The races themselves are grot< sque.
They have no high salaried judge's to
draw tine distinctions in favor of the cnas
â  rs of the track. The wholt crowd of
- decides who has won, and they
make no mistakes. They have no alleged

They wear no silken register* d
every Piute wears almost every

The purses are not always large. Yes
terday "Humholdt Natchez" won a purse
of only $2. But they are always honestly
and earnestly competed for from start to
finish.
The baseball Is a truly "wild and
wholly" performance. Not that they do
not pitch, bat, throw, catch and run with
some degree of proficiency, but there is
su. h an abundance and variety of uni
form and such a lack of uniformity and

a matter of business, basing our action on our

Ba9 that I believe they will reciprocate as
heartily on their part, for we have no fault

It certainly was unworthy of serious notice.

CHEATING THE NICKEL
MACHINES NO CRIME
REDDING. May 16.â A statutory enact
ment forbidding the uso of such Rambling
devices would have been a blow only a
little more severe to nickel-in-the-slot
machines than the decision of Judge
Sweeny in the Superior Court to-day in
the Indians again. The Walker River
branch of the Piutes tirmly believed in
tins at th>- time. Hut the dances of the
Plutea to-day have little if any resem
blance tv tin- wild and weird Incantations
said to nave been originated by Wilson.
Though tin y usually dance all night.
they have but two dances. One is the
"Que-que" clar.ee, which is supposed to
be a celebration of the annual run of the
que-que fish, large numbers of which are
caught daily at this time of the year in
the Truckee River and in Pyramid Lake.
In its performance aa many as wish toâ
Bom< times two or three hundred Indians
form In a circle, shoulder to shoulder, and
to the time of a doleful chanty sung- by
a number of the participators In the
dance, all move sideways, the entire cir
â¢ in the direction the hands of j
a clock move. The pace accel< rates until
ai .-. signal, which Bounds like the twit- :
tering ol a tree frog and which is passed
around th<- circle, all commence to hop ,
eidewlse, dragging their feet through the
sand. This time Bei ms to have an ac- |
celeration mark over it. and continues j
apparently until they get tired, when a
few minutes' rest is taken, after which
the dance is repeated and repeated again,
Bometlmea tor hours'.
For the sake of variety they do their
dance for a few hours. They call it
the "Toveneque" d^nce. The formation
is the same as in the "que-que," the chant
is the same, excepi that the words or
Bounds used make three-four time instead <
of four-four; the motion of the circle is
the same, hut in the side step, instead of ,
the right foot over the left the right Is
brought v- to the left and then the left
foot forward. The dance, with its sur
roundings of Indian dwellings, blazing
night fires, gaudy costumes, etc.. is weird,
but almost without rhythm or grace.
the habeas corpus case of W. N. Wood.
W I was arrested at Keswick on the i
charge of having passed counterfeit coin. !
liis real offense was that be t>layed aj
slot machine with a piece of Babbitt
metal the exact size of a nickel. Wood j
was caught playing the machine with j
"slugs" in the Hotel Keswick, using five i
lat a time, one for each slot. By this i
means It was no trouble to "break the I
bank."
While awaiting his preliminary exam
ination on the charge of having passed
i counterfeit money Wood applied for a
j writ of habeas corpus, The order grant
ing the writ was issued and made return
able this morning at 1" o'clock. Colonel
Charles A. Garter, ex-United States At
torney tor the Northern District of Cali
fornia, appeared in behalf of t"he prosecu
j tion. The hearing resulted in the pris
oner gaining his liberty.
Judge Sweeny hold that the people of
; the commonwealth have made laws which
pronounce it a crime to counterfeit gold
I or silver coin, but no mention is made of
other coins. Furthermore, the Judge
said the State could not afford to make
laws protecting gambling devices like the
nlckel-in-tne-slot mad lines.
It Is believed here this decision will re
i suit in a wholesale "run" on the ma
chine:-. Lead sings have been used here
frequently, but threats of arrest and
prosecution have heretofore served to
stop the occasional raids.. When it Is
known that no penalty la attached to
beating the machines, a "lookout" will
have to be employed, and that expense
will make the device unprofitable.
LOS ANQELES, May 16.â xhe ordinance
prohibiting the use of any class of nickel
â  in-the-slot machines will take effect to
morrow. There will be no compromise
with the machine owners, as the police
have beea instructed to arrest all who
violate the ordinance. The Police Com
mission will not temporize with the situa
tion, as it has refused to make a
single arrest as a test case, that will per
mit in the interim all other machines to
Ihe operated. Those who conduct resorts
where machines are operated declare to
night they are powerless to avert the
j operation of the law, and while they had
expected concerted action in the effort
to contest the ordinance they are now dls
posed to yield.

The colored miners were imported

Captain Coghlan "will be detached a few

MASSACRED BY
HEAD HUNTERS
Formosan Villagers Put
to Death.
EACH VICTIM DECAPITATED
SIX SCORES OF HEADS BORNE
OFF IN TRIUMPH. '
Love Affair Said to Have Been the
Cause of a Murderous Raid
on the Town of
Taiko. - V s <^
A '
Special Dispatch to The .Call.
VICTORIA. B. C, May 16.â News
I was received from Formos&by the Em
! press of India of a horrible massacre,
i 120 unarmed villagers being, ruthlessly
I slain and decapitated by a band of For
j mosan head-hunters Malay savages,
j who inhabit the interior of Southern
! Formosa, The massacre is reported to
'â  have occurred on April 7, in the vicinity
i of Taiko, central district.
The villagers were on their way back
to Taiko, after feasting at the shrine '
| of one of the gods, when the savages,
who were not as strong numerically as
the villagers but were armed, suddenly
arose from an ambuscade and charged
i upon the unarmed villagers. Out of the
party of 120 only three were able to
save their lives. The remainder were
massacred, every head being triumph
antly carried off by the savage assail
, ants.
The sad news was soon brought to
I the village by the terrified survivors,
and has since been creating a tremen
! dous sensation among the Japanese as
! well as the natives.
Strangely enough the cause of the
massacre is alleged to have been a dis
pute between the savage tribes over a
love affair. . A girl of the assailing
: tribe was wronged and died. A man
i of Taiko was accused, and compensa
j tion was demanded from him. He de
nied the* allegations and refused to
make compensation. Then the tribe
resorted to the head-hunting expedition
| to obtain revenge.
A Chinese interpreter is reported to
have paid a visit to the tribe after the
party had returned home with its
ghastly trophies. On his arrival he
' found them indulging in a feast, . with
the human heads arrayed side by side
on a row of boards.
A Formosan correspondent writing
I from Tarpeh says the authorities will
! send a punitive expedition to the hunt
j ers' villages. Head-hunting is a pas
; sion with these savages, says the cor
j respondent, and they probably never
: will be cured of it. Each tribesman
carries a grass basket over his shoul-
I der, in which he puts his heads when
taken. The head is usually placed on
I a tripod at the villages, where it is al
| lowed to remain until the flesh drops
I off. Then the skull, after being treated
, with a kind of liquor, is placed in a
| sort of skulL nookery over the doors of
; the huts. These heads are the most
! valued possessions of the head-hunters,
j and, in case of fire, the first objects to
I be saved.

been preying- upon the mind of Mrs. Rem
ington for some time. She was divorced
from her husband about seven year-
Five years later he died, and she collected
the Insurance on his life. With this money
as a nucleus she started to purchase the
house at 12 Adair street, paying a portion
of it as a deposit and giving two mort
gagesâone to the Hibernia Bank and the
other to the original owner of the house.
With her grown-up daughter, Ijulu, she
occupied the lower portion of the house
and supported herself by taking in lodg
ers and renting out the upper, flat.
The little linancial venture did not
prove successful. Lodgers did not come
and the upper flat is at present tenant
less. The mortgage was allowed to lapse
and finally the widow was informed that
she would he forced to vacate Ihe prem
ises by Saturday of this week. This made
her despondent and she btgan hinting at
suicide.
Yesterday afternoon she sent her
daughter down to the bank to draw, out
a small sum of mo*ey deposited there.
Miss Remington returned at about 3
o'clock and gave the money to' her
mother, who went out and paid what
sums she owed to tradesmen in the neigh
borhood. Just what time she returned to
the house is not known.
'At about 5 o'clock Isaac Crocker, who
boards -in the house, came in to supper.
Mrs. Remington could not be found in her
rooms, but nothing was thought of it un
til after supper, when Mr. Crocker started
to make a thorough search.
Finding the door leading to the upper
flat open, lit- went upstairs. As soon as
he reached the top of the stairs he saw
the body of Mrs. Remington hanging in
the doorway of the hall bedroom. She
had broken the glass in the transom,
tied a rope around the lintel, fastened the
other end around her neck and kicked the
chair from under her. If death was not
instantaneous she could have easily
saved herself, as the feet rested on the
floor and the knees were bent.
Mrs. Remington was fi3 years of age and
a native of Vermont. She leaves but one
child, her daughter Lulu.

TIIE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAT 17, 1899. Ij
cap was also a twister for the talent.
Rosornmnde, entirely overlooked, at odds
of 7 and J< to 1, led all the way, winning
hands down from La Goleta. The favor
ite. Horton. win Ruiz up. was run off on
n siding .somewhere 'tween stations, never
giving his backers any hope. Wyoming,
another well-played one, was left at the
post.
There were a number of good things cut
loose in the opening scramble for two
yi iir-olds, among the bunch Juletto, Ko
iena and Candlelight being well played,
fi proved easy for the favorite, Glis
sasdo. Away "third, Naglee Burkes colt
n< ver left the result in doubt, winning in
â i gallop from RKcetto. IMg Horn was a
close third.
The even-money favorite, Cabrillo,
made a gallop of the seven-furlong run
following. Jenkins had him in front al
mosi from the start, ;inrl won under re
straint from Lost Girl. The second choice.
Opponent, poorly bundled by Ward, was
never a contender.
A bow-wow race for a cheap assortment
of maidens, at a mile, fell to the favorite,
Sylvan Lass. l.adaea, second choice,
With Coburn in the saddle, after a stormy
trip, managed to take the place the last
few strides from Catastrophe.
Sly in her present form seems practi
cally unbeatable, and the fifth event, over
six furlongs, was no more than a romp
for the daughter of Racine. A 9 to 10
choice, she had shaken off Amasa by the
time the stretch was reached, and Social
ist, which closed fast, was unable to ex
tend her. Potente finished a close third.
Track Notes.
Corrigan had but one ra.ce put on the
card for him. and won it with Cabrillo.
15y the looks of this afternoon's menu it
would serin as if the greedy Westerner
might find more than one toothsome mor
sel. The llfth number is a special,
filled with three entriesâ one owned by
Corrigan, one by his nephew and the
other by Jimmy Coffey. Yet there are
horsemen quartered at Oakland track
with scarcely money enough to buy a
mi al, and no opportunities given their
horses to win a purse.
Jenkins kept up his reputation by land-
Ing four winners. He rides with excel
lent judgment and is very popular with
the public.
It is quite evident, from some of the
rides the Judges are overlooking, the offl
cliils have concluded to let the balance of
the meeting deteriorate into a catch-as
can affair.

Disgusted With the Philippines.
ALAMEDA. May 16.â H. Hiester of
1116 Park street returned from Manila
yesterday on the transport Valencia. He
was in the Philippines just three days,
and took advantage of . the first oppor-
tunity that presented itself to 'come home.
"It is a beastly climate," said Mr.
Hiester to-day, "and white men cannot
live there. Our soldiers are feeble and
haggard and avoid even the weight of
a canteen. They lie in the trenches with-
out shelter and are barely strong enough
to rise up and fire at the enemy.
"There will be great opportunities In tha
Philippines. for men with capital, but not
for the poor man. If a man must work it
is not the place for him to go. The ad-
ministration has made a mistake in keep-

I. J. TRUMAN. Treasurer.
C. B. PERKINS, "Deputy.
In explanation of the foregoing 'receipt I
Mr. Biggy made the following statement:
"In the latter part of December I con- i
suited with Mr. Broderick as to what !
course I should pursue in the matter of
the warrants and he suggested that I call '
the Commissioners' attention to them,
have them recorded and then have the
Auditor cancel the warrants. He also
suggested that I keep them on hand and
await the arrival of the derelicts. Act- \
Ing on his suggestion. I placed them un
der lock and key in a drawer in my of
fice. Those entitled to warrants occa
sionally dropped in until they dwindled
down to seven or nine. I then went to
Sacramento and on my . return some (
weeks later learned that they had been '
stolen. I set about a quiet investigation
In the hope of discovering the thief. I
learned that all of them had been cashed
and that the signatures on each warrant
had been . forged. Treasurer Truman's
deputy. Mr. Perkins, informed me that
he could Identify the man who had pre
sented them and different parties were
sent to his office on various pretexts, but
he was unable to do so.
"Previous to the theft, I tried to locate i
the derelict warrant holders, but could ;
only find three. They wore a Mr. Corrl
gan. Mr. Worrell and William McNam- '
ara. I paid Worrell arid Corrigan. Mr.
McNamara declined to accept the money.
as he had not served. Across his war
rant were the words. 'Did not serve.'
This warrant was in the hunch stolen j
and the forger had erased the words. â¢
forged the signature of its rightful owner
and cashed it.
"I reported the matter to the police at
the time and an Investigation was made.
Only three men had access to the locked
drawer. They were Harry 1. Mulcrevey.
John Burke and E. C. Kowler. As to the
honesty of Mulcrevey and Burke 1 will
stake my honor. I decline to make any
assertion about Fowler, either one way
or another. I will merely say that the
expert employed by the Police Depart
ment to examine into the case made the
statement that the person who wrote the i
minutes in my office forged the war-
Mr. Blggy stated he did nol desire to
on anj < mploye In his of
flce l>ut admitted that it looked bad for
Mr Fowler. He said he had an inter
view with Fowler, but he denied ever
touching tii" warrants. In concluding his
statement Mr. Biggy said he thought it
wise to pay over the money himsell so
â  [f those who earned the money came
for what was due them it would be â¢ "
hand. He Intended keeping the whole
matter quiet, h< said. Imt as he was go
i! g out "i office it was impossible.
]â¢:. C. Fowler, an ex-deputy In Registrar
Blggy's office, upon whom suspicion has
:. was indignant when Informed
about the matter last evening. T I . â¢ said:
â¢â¢I absolutely deny having a hand in it.
If it is in the hands of the police they
can't come to im* too quickly. Biggy is
doing this for cheap notoriety, but it is
liable to cost him more ihan he bargains
for I have a wife and child and I would
not do anything that would disgrace thorn.
As to Mr. Biggy or any one else's charge
that the man who wrote the minutes
forged the warrants I wish to say that
others besides myself wrote In the min
ute book I am not guilty of forgery nor
am I an expert penman. Mr. Biggy spoke
to ni" about the matter some time ago
and then 1 told him that 1 had nothing
to <\<< with their loss. I never had any
business in the Trout office. My business
wa in 'lie affidavit room. I never opened
Irawer that he speaks of nor did I
know where the key was kept. I will
give myself "i> to-morrow. I am Inno-
Chief of Police Lees stated last night
that his department had not taken any
in the matter, Captain Seymour
Informed of the theft some months
ago but as Mr. Biggy did not take fur
ther Bteps in the matter he paid no ui
tention to It.

bill so important to the women of
this State. He has by his action de
feated the will of the people, but this
condition of affairs cannot always
last. â Extract from oti a-ulrcs* by Mrs. 1..
M. .V. ISUven*, President National Woman's
Chri-tian Ttmperance f/nion.
His Excellency Governor Gage was the
r< â  ipi. Nt of a double scoring from the
earnest women who are meeting In con
vention here under the auspices of the
Woman's Christian Temperance Union.
The closing meetings of th" session were
held In the First Congregational Church
yesterday afternoon and evening.
During the course of an Interesting
paper on "Gleanings of Prohibition." Mrs.
R. A. Kmmons. the authoress, criticized
severely Governor Gage's veto of the law
granting cities of the fifth and sixth
classes the privilege of voting for license
or not. She praised the members of the
Legislature for passing the bill, and de
plored the action of the Chief Executive
in nullifying the proposed good work.
During the principal address of the after
noon Mrs. 1,. M. N. Stevens, president of
the National Woman's Christian Tem
perance Union, referred to the matter.
Sh<- deplored the action of "the Gov
ernor in defeating what*\vas obviously the
will of the people., by his veto of the
measure. From the time of her arrival
within the borders of the State she had
heard adverse comment upon the action
of the Governor In vetoing this measure,
so important to the women ( if this State
and to all interested in its; future. This

condition of affnirs. she felt assured,
would not continue long.
The paper prepared by Mr?. Emmons
and rend by Mrs. W. F. 'Southard was of |
a statistical character, dealing with the
crusade for temperance throughout the
State. Although definite results wore not
secured in many localities, there had been
a noticeable Improvement, especially In
view of the fact that there are 14.<XK) sa
loons in California, and that there is an
nually made from 13.000.000 to 20.000.000
gallons of wine. Among the places where
the movement has gained a foothold
are Pasadena. Riverside. Pacific Grove.
Ceres, Pomona. Berkeley and Palo Alto.
The speaker told of the spirited campaign
of education now being carried on in
many parts of the State.
Mrs. Stevens, the head of the Temper
ance Union in America, \tfas listened to
attentively. She praised the California
women for their bravery and loyalty in
lighting against the money of the liquor
traffic. She said the work was gradually
tending toward the goal of national pro
hibition. There had been partial defeats,
but. like true soldiers, they were loyal
and victory must come at some time. The
speaker had much to say about the ob
servation of parliamentary usage In con
ducting the work of the union.
Rev, J. V" Webb, State chairman of
the Prohibitionists. spoke entertainingly
of 1 1 ir- work done by his people and said
they were always glad to work in unison
with :ho Woman's T'nion.
Miss Anna Gordon, vice-president of the
National Woman's Christian Temperance
Union, was Introduced as the children's
friend. She spoke feelingly of Miss Fran
ces Willard, late president of the union,
and then told of the temperance work
among children in England and Americn.
Miss A. M. Hicks told "How We Did It
work which resulted in keeping saloons
In Berkeley," being a narrative of the
outside an imaginary line drawn one mile
from the university grounds.
Mrs. Thompson, treasurer of the Aus
tralian Woman's Christian â  Temperance
Union, was presented to those in attend
ance and was greeted with the Chautau
qua salute of waving handkerchiefs.

ressts were made by Mrs. L. M. N. Stev

The Alumni Association of the ('Diver

operate in the growth of a university in

are the arbiters to whom "everything can

Bet right. If there is to be great univer
sity the faculty must be men who will
attract attention by their success in fillâ
! ing the chairs of instruction. The fac
'. ulty must be harmonious and not allow
I dissensions to diminish its power for
good.
"Much depends on the body of students
which Is an active factor. We have a
good body of students and we are proud
of it. As they begin to form part of the
alumni they become in some sense, its
I chief strength and most reliable element.
| The generous benefactors must not be
omitted in the enumeration of the forces
that assist in the growth of the univer
sity. We must not overlook the name of
that lady who is now a member of the
board of regents, Mrs. Hearst, and others
who have given substantial help. There
| should be a closer union between the al
: umni and the outside benefactor."
Dr. Pardee replied to "The Regent Al
j umni." "I am not prepared to say." said
he. "whether it is for the best interests
of the university to have its governing
body entirely composed of alumni. We
have now in the regents four of our al
umni, among them Budd, Slack and Rein
stein, and we know that the university
is safe in the hands of these men. I hope
to see the day when the body, at least,
of the i gents shall be composed of its
alumni."
John R. Glaseock. in replying tc. "Our
Sphere of Influence." said: "The gradu
ate's duty is to hold himself out as an
exemplar, pure and spotless, before the
world. I exhort you to stand before the
world even if you have been over edu
cated, if that be possible. There cannot
be too much education if it is of the right
sort. Educate not only the head but the
hand and we will no longer' have our mil
lionaires proclaiming against a man hav
ing an education."
On "The University of Political Re
form" Professor Le Conte said: "The
aim of the university should be to ele
vate the general tone of politics and raise
it from a trade to a profession. The time
will come when political conditions will
be on a more liberal and honorable basis,
and the university is the influence that
will bring it about."

THE WAY TO FIGHT MONOPOLIES.
IH; ROM the efforts now being made by the fruit
of the State to save their industry from
the ' d cinch of a refrigerator car com
bine and monopoly, it is evident the directors of the
stand well the nature of the foe they
frghl : '. the best means of overcoming it.
â  organize a comprehensive system of
ration among the fruit-growers and to meet the
line with a greater combine.
The situation is one of no little danger to the fruit
industry. A great combination of capital controlled
ive and dominating men has seemingly
been formed in Chicago to acquire in the marketing
of fruit a control equal to that which similar com
ns now have over the beef market and the oil
market. If the plan of the combination be car
ut the fruit-growers of California will have a
â¢ upon their hands than ever, for it
accepted as certain the Southern Pacific Rail
the management of Huntington, will
c pi '\ver on the side of the Chicago
distance in crushing the Califor
nians.
The one way that promises security for the fruit
growers and the shippers of the State is to organize
such a . c association as will be able to con
proportion of the fruit output and thus be
in a position to compel the railroad to make terms,
ual facilities of transportation to the Eastern'
markets can be obtained from competing railways,
the growers and smaller shippers will be in a position
tn contend with the refrigerator car combine with
fair chances of success, but otherwise the contest will
bt almost a hopeless one.
In a conversation with a representative of The Call,
Mr. R. D. Stephens of Sacramento, who has been
from the first one of the most active promoters of
the proposed co-operation, expressed himself as quite
sanguine that if the growers succeed in forming the
contemplated organization they would be masters of
the situation. He is quoted as saying that under the
contemplated system of co-operative transportation
the shippers will be able to send their fruit to markets
v. here they know it will meet with ready sales. Be
sides, they will have a hold on the various railroad
lines, since they will be able to say upon which lines
they prefer to send their cars. Since the business of
carrying these refrigerator cars is profitable to the
railroad lines the growers will have no difficulty in
obtaining fair treatment and the most favorable trans
portation rates.
The prospect is the brighter because the fruit men
of California have had considerable experience in or
ganizing and conducting co-operative enterprises.
Fruit associations and fruit exchanges of a greater or
Lgnitudc exi=t in every county in the State, and
among the growers there are therefore many men
quite capable of directing the proposed movement to
a successful issue.
Sooner or later the Government will have to deal
lly with the practice of railways in granting
exceptional advantages to such combines as those
which now control the oil and the beef business, and
?.v<: threatening the fruit industry. Until that happens
the people must guard themselves, and fortunately for
California the men who carry on her rurarindustries
seem quite capable of doing so.
A young fiend of Howard City who killed his
grandmother, uncle and wife says he wanted to die
and did not wish to leave his wife behind. That kind
of affection seems to be finding a rather too frequent
expression. The authorities of Howard City have an
excellent opportunity to choke it out of one of its
citizens at least.
Russia and Great Britain seem to have met with a
stumbling-block in their very evident purpose to do
as they please in China. The Chinese have awakened
to the fact that they have something to say in the
matter and intend to say.it. There is naturally an ex
pression of horrified Russian and British indignation.
Secretary of War Alger wants to be elected to the
United States Senate as a mark of vindication. It
begins to look as if the upper house of Congress is
to be made a home of refuge for the repair of dam
aged reputations.
Ex-President Grovcr Cleveland denies emphatically
that he is dead. The ex-President always did enter
tain pronounced opinions which did not as a rule
meet the acceptance of the people.
William F. Herrin, hiding behind a Blackstock
mask, lias given another example of the extravagance
to which the Southern Pacific Company will resort in
criminal politics.
A MILITARY REPUBLIC.
IF we have truly reached the point of imperialism
and become that most faulty of all forms of govern
ment, a military republic, our history at least is
= not wanting in noble declarations of a higher pur
pose. Just what we are doing now, or that which it
i is claimed we must do because fate and Providence
! order it, has been consistently reprehended by Ameri
j can patriots from the beginning.
In 181 l Henry Clay, in a speech upon the coming
war with Great Britain and its alternative of an al
liance, said:
"England is said to be fighting in behalf of the
! world, and shall we, it is asked, attempt to weaken her
' exertions? If, indeed, the aim of the French Em
-1 peror be universal dominion, how nobler is the cause
presented to British valor! But how is her philan
; thropic purpose to be achieved? Is it by a scrupulous I
observance of the rights of others, by respecting that
cede of public morals which she professes to vindicate,
and by abstaining from self-aggrandizement? Then, in
deed, would she command the sympathies of the
', world. What are we called upon to do by those who
would engage our feelings and our wishes in her be
half? To bear the actual cuffs of her arrogance that
we may escape a chimerical French subjugation! We
are invited, conjured, to drink the potion of British
poison, actually presented to our lips, that we may
avoid the imperial dose prepared by perturbed imag
inations. We are called upon to submit to debase
ment, dishonor and disgrace; to bow the neck to
royal insolence as a course of preparation for manly
resistance to Gallic invasion! Let us come home to
our own history; it was not by submission that our
fathers achieved our independence."
In his speech on the Greek revolution of 1824 Mr.
Clay said: "If it were possible for republicans to
c<ase to be the champions of human freedom, and it"
Federalists became its only supporters, I would cease
;tc be a republican; I would become a Federalist."
In his speech at Baltimore in 1828, on "Enthusiasm
for Military Renown," he said: "Cromwell and
1 Caesar have recently found apologists. The judgment i
iof centuries is reversed; long established maxims are
overthrown, and the only genuine lovers of liberty
, were the Philips, the Caesars, the Cromwells, the
Mariuses and the Syllas of former ages!. It is time
for slumbering patriotism to awake' when such doc
: trines as these are put forth from the Capitol and from
popular assemblies. Regardless of all imputations,
and proud of the opportunity of free and unrestrained
intercourse with my fellow citizens, I would address
every man in the Union and entreat them by their
love of country, by their love of liberty, for the sake
iof themselves and their posterity â in the name
of their venerated ancestors, in the name of the human
; family deeply interested in the fulfillment of the trust
' committed to their hands, to pause. I would prostrate
myself before Divinity and implore him, if it be neces-
I sary to chastise this people with the rod of his venge-
I ance, to visit our beloved land with pestilence, with
famine, with any scourge other than military rule, or
; a blind and heedless enthusiasm for mere military re
nown.''
After four score and eight years the situation of 181 1
:is repeated. Now England is urging us to repudiate
j our pledges, our, purposes, our history; to cas.t over
, board the chart of the Declaration of Independence
; and the compass of the constitution, to silence the
pleadings of conscience and jeer at our past profes
â  sions, because if we do not the Continental nations of
i Europe will combine against us!
Appeals are made to our cupidity, to our commer
cial instincts, to our lust of power. and hunger for
conquest, when there should be a simple measure and
a plain way to test our course and determine our
I policy. If it require the turning of the Declaration of
Independence to the wall and the assumption by the

BRYONARCHY PROFESSIONS.
/'"â "Â» OLONEL BRYAN, having recovered from
I military lockjaw, is using his submaxillary free-
dom in keeping himself in the public ear. The
small band of third-rate politicians who promoted his
candidacy in 1896, and whose nostrils sniffed the
odors of the political fleshpots which were stewing
and bubbling in the mirage of that year of dreams,
rainbows and illusions, are still at it. Ex-Governor,
Stone of Missouri is tne leader of these apostles, and
though it is suspected that Bryan was originally an
acquired taste with him, it is now a habit as con
firmed as" smoking in a Filipino. Stone counts on
Republicans and Populists to pull Bryan
' through, and announces that there is no room at any
j dollar dinner for a gold Democrat, and that such
shall not even have access to the crumbs when the
tablecloth is shaken. It is expected that those who
â  used to be Democrats will be kept in the panorama
! by eating dollar dinners dedicated to Jefferson.
Mr. Jefferson has been a long time dead and has
not even an administrator to defend him. Under the
newspaper signature law of California a penalty could
be collected for ascribing to him the financial ideas
of Colonel Bryan unless the article were signed by
the writer and confessed to be defamatory of the dead
and defenseless.
In his "Notes on the Establishment of a Money
Unit and of a Coinage for the United States" (Works
of Jefferson, pages 162-174) he says: "The proportion
between the values of gold and silver is a mercantile
. problem altogether. The legal proportion in Spain
is 16 to 1, in England 15V2 to 1, in France 15 to 1.
l Just principles will lead us to disregard legal ratios
I altogether and to inquire into the market price of
gold in the several countries with which we shall be
I principally connected in commerce and to take an
average from them. It is not impossible that 15 to 1
may be found an eligible ratio. I state it, however,
as a conjecture only." On page 170 he proposed
that Congress instruct the Committee of the States
"to appoint proper persons to inquire what are the
proportions between the values of fine gold and fine
silver in the markets of the several countries with
which we are. or probably may be, connected in com
merce, and what would be 'a proper ratio here, hav
ing regard to the average of their value at those mar
kets and to other circumstances, and to. report the
same to the committee, by them to be laid before
Congress."
In 1792 he wrote to Hamilton, approving his "re
port on the establishment of a mint, what ought to be
the nature of the money unit of the United States
and what the ratio between gold and silver, if coins
of both metals are to be established." (See Hamil
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, 31AY 17, 1899.
ton's Works, volume 3, pages 149-188). Hamilton's
conclusion was: "That in establishing a ratio be
tween the metals, the mean or average ratio in what
may be called the commercial world is the proper one.
There can hardly be a better rule in any country for
the legal than the market ratio, if this can be sup
posed to have been produced by the full and steady
course of commercial principles. The presumption in
such case is that each metal finds its true level ac
* ording to its intrinsic utility in the general system
of money operations." Of this Jefferson says in his
letter to Hamilton: "I return your report on the
mint, which I have read over with a great deal of
satisfaction. I concur with you in thinking that the
mint must stand on both metals, and also in the ratio
you establish between the two metals."
In another place (volume 1, page 171) Jefferson
says: "I would still incline to give a little more than
the market price for gold, because of its superior con
venience in transportation."
Just how these views of Jefferson are to be recon
ciled with the financial planks of the Chicago plat
form remains for Colonel Bryan to say. One thing
is clear, however, that the bolters of 1896, the gold
Democrats who stood on the Indianapolis platform,
are still the representatives of the financial principles
of Jefferson. And it is equally clear that the silver
Republicans do not represent the principles of Hamil
ton, to whom may be finally traced the .political
philosophy of the Republican party.
It is difficult to reconcile the doltar-a-plate dinner
declarations of fidelity to the principles, of Jefferson
with the honesty of those who make them, provided
they have ever read Jefferson's views.
A TRANS-MISSISSIPPI PROBLEM.
UNDISMAYED by the defeat of his efforts to
procure the enactment by the last Congress of
legislation directed toward the upbuilding of our
merchant marine, Senator Hanna is reported to be
working as actively as ever in that direction. It is an
nounced that he has started a movement to have the
subject taken up by the Trans-Mississippi Congress
at its coming session and supported as a measure of
public good without regard to party politics.
In order to bring the matter before the congress
the Senator has sent out a circular letter to the Gov
ernors of the States to be represented there request
ing them to exert their influence in its support. Ac
cording to a telegraphic summary of the circular, "the
Senator says: "You will find among the Pacific
Coast and Gulf States particularly and in a number of
interior States a strong and growing desire to see
American ships replace foreign ships engaged in
carrying our imports and exports, and to which the
people of this country are paying $200,000,000 every
year, every' dollar of which goes to enrich foreigners
at our expense. This is by no means a political and
least of all a partisan question. It is wholly an indus
trial question, just so much so as the improvement of
our rivers and harbors is an industrial and commercial
subject."
â  Whether the issue can be kept out of party politics
remains to be seen. The promotion of the American
merchant marine is a necessary adjunct to the Repub
lican system of protection, and as such is not likely to
receive Democratic support. That, however, is a
minor matter. The main thing is to make the im
portance of the issue known to the people, and to
that end Senator Hanna has acted wisely in calling
to it the attention of the Trans-Mississippi Congress.
It ir a subject which should be studied on this side of
the continent with more than ordinary interest and
care.-
"he circumstances are such that the promotion of
our merchant marine is essentially a trans-Mississippi
problem. The commerce between Europe and the
United States is well supplied with shipping, and there
is not likely to be much immediate increase in the
traffic. The trad^ of the Pacific, on the other hand,
seems well assured of an enormous expansion. It is
toward the Orient the great manufacturing nations of
earth are turning for markets. No other part of the
civilized world holds a position more advantageous
for that trade than the Western States of our Union.
Our interests in the upbuilding of a merchant ma
rine arc therefore greater even than those of the East,
and it certainly should receive earnest consideration
by any congress called to consider the welfare of the
West.
The policy of protection has now built up our manu
facturing industries to such power, that they produce
more than the needs of our people require, and con
sequently we are now exporting large quantities of
manufactured goods. The next step to be taken is to
provide American ships to carry American goods
abroad. Legislation to that end is therefore the im
perative need of the time, and whether done as a par
tisan or non-partisan measure it should certainly be
provided at the next session of Congress.
At a banquet given at Manila by Professor Schur
man in honor of Admiral Devvey the health of the
American army was drunk "with the utmost cor
diality." If reports from the battlefields of the Phil
ippines be true, it will take more than a toast and the
clinking of glasses in good fellowship to preserve the
health of American soldiers.
Aguinaldo seems now inclined to talk rather than
fight, and General Otis has promised Washington
that he will soon have the rebel leader in a condition
where he will not even be able to talk. Spain talked
enough with the Filipinos to teach Uncle Sam that
there is sometimes no eloquence so persuasive as the
sting of a bullet.
General Gomez and his "army" are fighting over the
enormous sum of money which the United States
Government has ordered to be distributed among the
Cubans. It is a consolation to know that the Cuban
army could be induced to fight over something.
Since the Police Commissioners can, if they choose,
refuse a license to any saloon proprietor who permits
gambling games on his premises, the continuance of
such places may be justly considered as having the
open sanction of the Commissioners.
A dispatch announces that one of a set of Ameri
cans engaged in a ferocious bullfight at Durango for
tunately escaped death from one of the infuriated,
baited animals. It would have been better news if the
dispatch read "unfortunately."
Four hundred Porto Ricans are now, by the au
thority of Secretary of War Alger, wearing the uni
forms of American soldiers. If the Spanish war be a
precedent for opinion, the new garb will be found
to be rather large.
While Huntington cannot be put on the list of those
who talk too much, he has a right to head the roll
of those who say it wrong whenever they say it at all.
If it were possible to have the Baldwin Hotel ruins
moved off along with the fence the improvement of
the corner would be notable.

GROEZINGER
COMES DOWN TO
PERSONALITIES
Makes a Bitter Attack
on Judge Graham.
GRAHAM'S DIGNIFIED REPLY
ACTING JUDGE WILL ASSERT HIS
BIGHTS AND STAY ON.
Only Solution Out of the Difficulty-
Is for Judge Treadwell
to Return to
Duty.
Acting Police Judge Groezinger opened
up the vials of his wrath yesterday at
the criticisms of the press, the pulpit and
his brother Judges on the absurd deci
sions he rendered in the racetrack and
nickel-in-the-slot machine cases.
"When he took his seat on the bench
yesterday morning he said in a dramatic
manner to Howard Vernon, the stenogra
pher of the court: "1 want you to take
down word for word what I am about to
say." The courtroom was crowded in the
expectation that something would develop
in view of the expressed determination of
Presiding Judge Graham to have no more
cases assigned to Grotzlnger's court.
Groezinger, after clearing his throat,
dictated the following statement to the
stenographer:
Seeing the attacks on me In the newspapers
this morning by a certain Judge of this court.
I desire to state right here that I am going
to sit on this bench as long as Judge Tread
well is absent. 1 am going to insist on the
cases being assigned to me. and the first man.
Judge or officer, that attempts to interfere
with the calendar of this court will be here
for contempt of court. I de9ire to say that
I am glad that I am fortunate enough that
my picture is not in the rogues' gallery for a
certain crime at the picture of a certain Judge
of this court Is. I do not refer to Judge Mu
gan, but I refer to a certain Judge whose name
I will not mention. I took these Ingleside race
track cases and tried them fairly and hon
estly as a man, and I have decided the cases
according to my convictions. I do not think
it Is right for a Judge of this court to be so
discourteous as to make the remarks behind
another's back as Judge Graham has. â¢ I would
have been willing ot first, if the Judges of this
court came to me in a gentlemanly and proper
way, to retire without anything further being
said, but In view of the Etand taken this morn
ing in the daily press I am going to stay here
and cannot he put out by any such actions as
these. The law is too plain and requires the
Chief of Police to assign the cases alternately
to the several departments of the Police Court.
I will give Judge Graham a chance to show
his purity and will assign all niekel-in-the-slot
cases to his department to-morrow.
The news of the bitter personal and
brutal attack made upon Judge Graham
quickly spread around the hall and Groe
zinger was generally denounced for â¢at
tacking a man who had carved out for
himself an honorable name in the commu
nity. Judge Mogan waited upon Groe
zinger and wanted to know distinctly if
any reference was made to him in regard
to a picture of a Judge being in the
rogues' gallery. Groezinger said that he
referred to Judge Graham and later as
serted that he had seen the picture.
Detective Bainbridge positively assert
ed that no such picture was or ever had
been in the rogues' gallery and comment
ed harshly on Groezinger making such a
statement from the bench about another
Judge, even though it were true. Chief
Lees refused to discuss the matter, say
ing he had no desire to be drawn into a
controversy between two Judges.
Judge Graham at first felt keenly the
unwarranted slander, but later treated
the matter in a dignified manner. When
spoken to he said:
"I feel more sorry than angry that
Judge Groezinger should havo found it
necessary to make such an uncalled for
and untruthful attack upon my good
name, as I have refrained from personal
ly attacking him. He should know that
when he said my picture adorned the
rogues' gallery he was not telling the
truth. The facts are that when I was a
boy about " years of age I was guilty of
an indiscretion, more the act of a thought
less boy than anything else, -the punish
ment for which is. as a rule, a repri
mand from the bench or chastisement at
home. It is to be regretted that at this
late day the act of a thoughtless boy
should be brought up against him in a
controversy that should be conducted on
manly terms."
The position taken by Groezinger as to
holding court is said to be unassailable.
lie was regularly appointed by the Mayor
to dispense justice >n Department 4 dur
ing the absence of Judge Treadwell and
as, according to the constitution, the
Chief of Police is instructed "to assign the
cases alternately in the different courts,
the Chief, even if armed with a written
request spread on the minutes of the
courts not to assign cases to Department
4, could not obey any such order.
The only solution out of the difficulty is
to get Judge Treadwell back as soon as
possible and every effort will be made to
bring about his return.

|of Education and representative mer
j chants made a tour of inspection of the
i public school buildings yesterday for the
I purpose of ascertaining the needs of the
department, so that ample provision may
be made for the same in the next tax
| levy, or in the bond election proposed for
! obtaining the money for needed public
improvements. Those who comprised the
party were: Mayor Phelan Auditor

I calls were made at the Richmond, Sunny
; side and Sutro Primary schools, where
I new buildings are needed for the accom
j modation of the children of school age in
j the rapidly growing districts in which the
: schools are situated. MenatÂ»ers of the
| School Department explained the needs
of the districts and gave estimates of the
cost of new buildings and the proposed
details of their construction.
At noon the members of the commit
tee of inspection were the guests of Mr.
Holbrook at lunch at the Bohemian Club.
j In the afternoon the committee again set
forth and visited the Hamilton Grammar
School and other school buildings in va
rious districts of the. city. It was found
i that the Hamilton school is in a bad state
|of decay and wholly inadequate to the
; needs of the district. It is. proposed to
repair the present building: and make
such additions to it as are deemed neces
sary to accommodate the scholars.
To-day the committee will continue the
tour of inspection, and will inspect all of
the school buildings in the city not vls
j lted yesterday.

their troth. - The Ceremony was performed
at 9 o'clock last evening. Father Varsi, a
lifelong friend of the fair, bride, officiating.
| Only the immediate friends of the young

The home of the bride at 2020 Buchanan
I street was bright with many flowers, that
| mingled their splendid foliage with the
stars and stripes. The decoration of the
home was the work of a few of the many
devoted friends of the popular bride. The
bride of the gallant doctor of the Olympia
is the daughter of the late William Bur
i ling, whose name is prominently identi
! tied with the early history of the State.
In the select circle in which Miss Burling
moved she has been an acknowledged
I belle, captivating and holding her many
i admirers by her charming manners, at
! tractive personality and rare tact. The |
1 happy doctor is the son of a prominent
I Southern family, and was with Dewey
! during the Manila Bay naval achieve-
I ments.
The gown of the bride was a marvel of
the dressmaker's art. It was of white
satin, made en train and trimmed with
deep flounces of point lace that had orna
mented the bridal gown of her mother.
Miss King wore an exquisite gown of
white mull over pink silk. Miss LiiiHta
Burling was attired in a frock of -white

THE WIDOW OF
FRANK E. BECK
WINS HER SUIT
Endowment Case De
cided in Her Favor.
SUICIDE WAS NOT PROVED
LAW LEANS IN FAVOR OF THE
DEAD MAN'S HEIRS.
Insurance Companies Must Establish
by Evidence Violations of Con
tract by Decedent or
Must Pay.
United State? Judges Gilbert, Ross and
Morrow, sitting as a Circuit Court of
Appeals yesterday, handed down an opin
! ion that will be of interest to fraternal
j and beneficiary societies and other or
| ganizafions in which life insurance is a
feature.
The case was that of Lillian H. Beck
vs. the Supreme Lodge of Knights of
Pythias of the World. The plaintiff is
the widow of Frank E. Beck, a member
|of the endowment rank. Beck blew out
'' his brains with a shotgun and the Coro
{ ner's jury returned a verdict to the ef
i feet that he had committed suicide while
temporarily insane. The life of the de
â¢ 1 was insured in the endowment
: rank for $3000 A clause in the by-laws
; provides that, if death results from bu|
cide, or causes superinduced by intoxi
cating liquors, narcotics, etc., the amount
I to be paid shall be the sum only in pro
: portion to the whole amount as "the ma
i tured life expectancy" is to the entire
j expectancy at the date of admission of
j the deceased into the endowment rank.
In conformity with the by-laws just
| quoted the sum of $138 was tendered to
I the widow in full payment of the obli
! gations of the society. She refused to
! acxept that sum and brought suit for
' the whole of the $3000. She won the case
and the Supreme Lodge appealed.
In the course of a very elaborate and
i profound decision the CourK of Appeals
! says that the defendant should have
: proved that the deceased came to his
! death with suicidal intent, and it did not
devolve upon the widow to prove by a
preponderance of evidence that his death
resulted from the accidental discharge ot
i his gun. The Supreme Lodge claimed also
that the trial court should have directed
the jury to return a verdict for the de
fendant on the ground that the death of
the deceased should be treated as "one
in violation, or attempted violation of the
criminal law" (Beck .having previously
threatened to kill his wife and then him
self). On this point the Court of Appeals
say that the evidence did not show that
he was engaged in unlawful acts at the
time he met his death.
The judgment of the lower court was
affirmed and the widow w^ill get the $3000.

COURSE OF STUDY.
Arthur Matthews Shows a Picture in
the Paris Saion and Prepares
for an Early Return
Home.
â¢The annual exhibition of the students
of. the California School of Design opens
to-niglu in the classrooms at the Hop
Â». kins Art Institute. The display of stu
dent work is an unusually good one and
twenty-five pupils are -represented in
studios of the nude, antique, still life,
color, composition, perspective and por
traits. The color work is considerably
more extensive than that of former years
and is sure to attract a great deal of at
tention.
The opening of the exhibition will be
made the occasion of a reception, at
which all the vms and members of
the faculty will assist. The. main feature
of the reception this evening will be the
announcement of the winners of the eight
scholarships, entitling each respective
victor to one year's free scholarship at
the School of Design. The faculty met
yesterday for the purpose of awarding
the scholarships, but the work was go
uniformly good that no decision was
reached, and the committee asked time
to reconsider and arranged for a meeting
this morning at 10 o'clock.
The exhibition will remain open for
several days. The work shown embraces
the rombined efforts of the regular stu
dents of the school, the evening classes
and the Saturday class.
The regular term of the Art School will
brgln on August 9. The faculty, as here
tofore, will include R. D. Yelland, Alice
â¢ 'hittenden. Harry Fonda. John Stanton,
Douglas Tilden and Judson Arthur Mat
thews, who is expected back next month
with tho added glory of a portrait ex
hibited at the Paris Salon, and will re-
Join the faculty. ,
The plans for the new term, though still
indefinite, promise many innovations on
an elaborate scale. Wood carving is
among the i lore probable possibilities.

COLLEGES OF AGRICULTURE
Preparations Being Made to Enter
tain the Coming Guests.
The convention of members of the Asso-
Sciation of American Agricultural Colleges
and Experiment Stations, which will meet
here on July 5, 6 and 7, promises to be of
much importance to the State at large.
; These professional gentlemen make care
ful and scieiuilic investigations of the soil
climate, etc.. of every part of the United
States, and their findings are rated as the
# liest by those who are In search of homes
1 Being an independent body, their verdict
in all matter? is considered conclusive. It
has long been the desire of those most
I interested in securing a desirable class of
settlers for the State to have the colleges
make an investigation of the possibilities
and resources of California, well knowing
that there would b< little to fear when
the report of the State was made.
Aft>^r the regular "usiness of the con
vention is transacted the members of the
convention will make an extended trip
through the principal parts of the State
and carefully look Into all matters con
cerning natural resources. One railroad
has promised the gentlemen a special
car to visit the Napa and Sonoma dis
tricts, and the professors 'of the State
K University are making arrangements for
a visit to all other parts of the State.
To this end they will meet in the rooms
of the Chamber of Commerce on Thurs
day. There will also be present represen
tatives of nearly all the commercial
bodies of the city. It is expected that
Mayor Phelan will preside over the meet
ing.
A general invitation Is extended to all
who are desirous of assisting in the mat
ter of entertaining the coming guests.

EIGHTEEN YEARS
THEIR PASTOR
REV. DR. E. B, SPALDING Honored bu His Con
' aregation,
RV.Y. DR. K. B, SPALDING. pastor of St. John's Episcopal Church, on
Fifteenth street, was the recipient of a very pleasant surprise last
night in the jniildroom of the church, tendered by the members of his
congregation on the occasion of the eighteenth annlVefaary of his pas
torate. It would Vie needless to mention that the utmost pood fellowship exists
between minister and congregation In St. John's parishâso much so that the
quarterly meeting of the Ladles' Aid Society of the church' which was held
last nitrht. was made the occasion of extending to the pastor a bouquet of the
kind sentirhents harbored fur him by those who have labored with him during
his long and faithful services.
In addition to his duties as pastor of one of the largest parishes fn the
diocese. Dr. Spalding attends to the entire management of Trinity School,
an institution thnt receives the recognition of all colleges both in the United
States and England.
The church of which Dr. Spalding is pastor was organized as early as
1857 by the Rev. John Chittende-n. and was then located on what was known
as First avenue, between Fifteenth and Sixteenth streets, and not far from
Its present location.
With few changes in its pastorate. thf> little church grew with th.p growth
of the E!eventh Ward until eighteen years apo. whm Bishop Kip, at the
esl of the parishioners, assigned Dr. Spalding to the church. Since that
time the church membership lias Increa ed <â > such an extent that the old
building which stood on the corner of Fifteenth and Valencia streets became
tto sn:.-:ll for the congregation. A larger oneâ the present structureâ was built
about six years ago. In addition to this there is ;i chapel, known as the Holy
Innocents, located on Fair Oaks street., which is presided over by an assistant
clergyman. And still further. Dr. Bpaldir.g devotes a great portion of his
time to.the management <>f St. I.uk-'s Hospital.
The social last night was under the direct supervision of Mrs. J. \V. Coch
ran. the president of the Ladies' Aid Society, and the following officers of the
church: F. W. Van Reynegoth, senior warden; F. H. Klchhaum. junior
warden; James Rolpb, Jr.. clerk; F. L. Southack, treasurer; Henry Kirke
White, choirmaster; Mrs. Henry F. Williams. Mrs. Emma G. Wendell, Mrs. F.
L. Southack, Mrs. W. Weston and Mrs. M. A. Gale.

DRIED FRUIT IN NEW YORK.
â¢ The New York Commercial pays: "'Peaches i
attract some attention, and there is a mod- ,
crate consuming demand at about previous j
prices. Quotations are bo high that the trade
is moi-e or less restricted. Movement active,
according to circumstances. There is no ex
port demand, but local dealers take fairly lib
eral orders, considering the price situation. j
"Apricots are steady and high, and holders,
Bhow no disposition to shade. Supplies are bo
email that all holders are firm in their vlej*.
und refuse to concede anything to purchasers j
for the cake of Influencing from < alifornia I
"Conflicting information from California
causes an unsettled â  ling in raisins. There j
are reports of serious frosts which may in
jure the crop, but the next mall brings a de
nial. One letter says that the association and
the packers have come together and that the â 
required 90 per cent of the acreage has signed
the agreement. Another contradicts all these I
statements and lays ... stress upon
some controverted point which may or may i
not be important Meanwhile rpoi supplies are .
moving out freely and are said to be well
cleaned up Prices hold steady on practically j
nli grades of loose Muscatels, while layers j
and clusters are dull and holders Inclined to j
shade prices to carry them out.
"Prunes show no change. There is a firm
feeling influenced to some extent by reports
of a drop enrlier than usual, and also by j
statements that supplies are well cleaned up
in tirst hands. Demand is not especially active, ,
but then- are a few orders for small quan- j
titles. It is the quiet season, and holders ex- [
pect little business. .- me holders have ceased i
to urge sales and are putting; supplies in cold |
storage. Others would be glad to clear up I
what â  hey have and save the expense of cold
storage."

EASTERN MARKETS.
SEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May To-day's market was
remarkably quiet after the recent excitement, ]
the total sales being little more than half the
number of shares sold during the panicky two
hours of Saturday. Apparently there was no
Fuch thine as a bear speculator in existence.
but with the exception of slight irregularity in
prices at the opening and a slight relaxation
in values in the last hour of the market the
course of prices was steadily held or moved
unceasingly upward. This was rather contrary
to the general expectation, which was that
prices would tend downward in the absence of
buying by shorts, who were largely closed out
by yesterday's rise, and with a less strenuous
eupport from the powerful alliance of capital
ists who came to the rescue or' the market.
This combination was believed to be simply
for the purpose of sustaining the market
against any precipitated* attempt at liquida
tion. The bull movement which the late
Mr Flower and his associates had in
augurated previous to his death was
fell to be bold under the existing
conditions, and Its continuance In full ever
since was hardly looked for. Under the cir
cumstances there seemed a fair probability that
Rome of the. uncertainties incident to the sea
tun might cause a reactionary tendency for a
time. But the professional traders after the
early transactions took the lons side of the
market and there was uninterrupted absorp
tion of an extremely varied list of stocks
throughout the day. Any Interruption to the
advance threw the market into a lethargy and
nothing but a resumption of the ride brought
any activity. London was scarcely a factor
either way, the market there being neglected
on account of uneasiness about the situation
in China. A slight hardening In the rate of
exchange had no other explanation than this
Mini' uneasiness. Money in New York, how
ever, worked decidedly easier under the Influ
ence of receipts from the interior. The money
market also benefited from yesterday's pay
nu-nt r,f the SS.QQD.mo to Spain on account of
the Philippine purchase. The Flower stocks,
especially People's Gas and Brooklyn Transit,
enjoyed the greatest advantage in the day's
movement, but there were notable advances
also in thÂ» stocks of other New York munici
pal corporations on the prospect of amending
the Ford franchise tax bill. Stocks of the
various stee! and Iron companies were also
Strong, and there was activity and strength In
Clllcaco Terminal. In the railway list Central
and Southern Pacific rose nearly .'( per cent on
c belief of a beneficial effect of. the unification
of the system. A number of other railroads
ndvnnced a point or over and sugar is up 3
points on the da. Tobacco gained 5U points.
The losing was near the top and firm but
quiet.
The tendency of prices was marked also in
the bond department. There was a heavy ab-
Eorptli n of Rnch [aland fours, and the Atchlson
adjustment fours and Wisconsin Central firsts
were also strong and active. Total sales 13 -

AVAILABLE GRAIN SUPPLY.
NEW YORK, May 16.â Special cable and tele
graphic dispatches to Bradstreefs Indicate the
following changes in available supplies last
Saturday: "â 
Wheat, United States and Canada, east of
the Rockies, decreased 2,124,000 bushels; afloat
for and in Europe, increased 3,000,000; total sup
ply, increase. 878,000 bushels.
Corn, United States and Canada, east of the
Rockies, decreased 3.547,000 bushels.
Oats. United States and Canada, east of the
Rockies, increased 403,000 bushels.
The more important decreases include those
of 360,000 bushels at Manitoba storage points.
262,000 at Fort William and Keewatin. 200,000
at Northwestern interior elevators and 189,000
at Galveston.
The heaviest increase is 106,000 bushels at
Cleveland.
The combined stock of wheat at Portland,
Or., and Tacoma and Seattle, Wash., increased
46,000 bushels last week.
THE LEMON MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 16.â The Journal of Com
merce says: According to reliable statistics,
receipts of lemons from Mediterranean ports
from the" beginning of the current season to
date have been considerably In excess of those
for the corresponding period last year. At
New York from September 1. IS9B. to May 15,
1599. there arrived 1,278,000 boxes, as compared
with 805,000 boxes during that period in 1&97-9 R.
At outports, with the exception of Boston, the
Increase In receipts this reason to date over
last have also been marked. .Arrivals at Mon
treal are reported to be 50 per cent larger than
those of last year. New Orleans so far this
season has received 76,000 boxes, against 28,000
boxes last year. At Boston this season's re
ceipts so far have been Â«4,000 boxes, against
70.000 a year ago. but Philadelphia and Balti
more have received 78,000, as compared with
20,000 boxes last year.
One prominent feature of the market in
favor of Mediterranean fruit has been the ab
sence of competition from California during
the spring months owing to the virtual failure
of the Pacific Coast crop last year. This has
opened the markets of the West and Middle
West to handlers of Sicily lemons and the de
mand from that section has very materially
assisted In keeping up prices in the Eastern
markets. In the latter, prices have been grad
ually hardening of late, and at the close to
day were on good fruit fully 60c per box
higher than at the same time last week, but
at the same time recent arrivals are said
to have shown a considerable quantity of fruit
out of condition and otherwise inferior, which
has been somewhat of a drag on the mar
ket This, in connection with sales at out
ports is held to have prevented an advance
that would have naturally followed greatly en
larged consuming demands from all points trib
utary i" New York as well as that from the
West
Notwithstanding recent receipts, the avail
able stock for next thirty days does not ex
ceed that for the same period last year. Hold
ers here look for steady if not higher market
hereafter. â¢

Harrison's circular says:
"Since the Marlposa left, the following car
goes of Australian coal were delivered here,
viz.: Andreta, 269S tons; Pyrenees. 3f.2n tens;
Star of Bengal. 1734 tons; Cypromene, 2758
tons, total 10. 70S tons. The total arrivals from
Newcastle and Sydney for the past three
months only foot up a little over 30,000 tons.
This is h marked shrinkage from former years
for the same period, but we now anticipate
there will be a very different showing later
In the year. We have Identically the same
number of vessels on the engaged list as when
our last mail left, thirty-seven vessels with
a carrying capacity of about 99,000 tons: twelve
of these art- now en route with about 35,000
tons. The latest cabled coal freight quota
tions on coal for early loading are 15s 6d
from Newcastle, with a slight shading for
later loading. Evidently there is a scarcity of
tonnage in Australian waters, as carriers are
preferring to load for nitrate ports, rather than
for here. If there should be an active demand
for grain carriers at fair figures, this would
prove an Incentive /or shipowners to seek this
port, but for the moment this branch is at a
standstill. Notwithstanding the light deliver
ies of Colonial fuel, there Is no apparent scarc
ity, demonstrating the ability of our coast col
lleries to fully supply our demands, hence it
would appear to have been 111-timed judgment
for Newcastle owners to have advanced their
prices for ISO 9. as high freights and high-priced
coal combined will divert business from their
product."

JEFFORDS WAS HISSED
The Bitr Heavy-Weight Lost by Foul
Tactics When He Received Pun
ishment From Stelzner.
The Pan Francisco Athletic Club had a
crowded house last evening. The sports
gathered to witness the twenty-round con
test between â¢Mack" Stelzner and "Jim"
Jeffords, the bip heavy-weight who some
time asri easily disposed of a brace of
chumps ;m<l was thought to be "a coming
Jeffords made a very pood showing
apainst his clever opponent for seven or
eight rounds, but when Stelzner had
taken his measure Jeffords quickly faded
away under straight left hand leads. It
was in the seventh round that Jeffords
stopped a hard left bard punch with his
left optic, and the cut, which left his eye
brow open; angered him to such a pitch
that he forpot bow to tight fairly and re
sorted to several mean tricks, in the hope
of losing on a foul.
In the eighth round Stelzncr was put
tins: his left with good force on the sore
.-â â¢ pot. and Jeffords swung wildly, in the
hope of landing a knockout, but he
â  only cut big holes in the smoky atmo-
Hphore. In the ninth Jeffords' tripped
Stelzner and in the tenth he caught his
opponent around the body and Hung him
to the boards.
Referee Greggains immediately declared
the contest against foul fighter Jeffords,
who received a warm hooting from the
spectators, who proved by their feelings
of disgust that they would not journey a
block to see such a man as Jeffordsâ who
Is a second Billy Smithâ fipht again:
The. contest between "Jack" Porter and
August Amoit ended in the seventh round.
The referee decided in favor of Porter,
who was outclassed by his antagonist in
every round excepting the second. The
decision was not favorably received by
the spectators.
Charles Thurston defeated Charles
Vlckers in a ten-round contest, and
"Jack* Fegoni easily best Tom ftarkins
in a four-round bout.
POSTUM CEREAL.
A BUSINESSLIKE UNCLE
Knew a Good Thing and Took It.
"As we were sitting flown to supper
not long ago. In came Uncle ,
who wan invited to sit flown to the
table, but declined. He was so troubled
with dyspepsia that he seldom took a
meal in the evening.
"We had P< stum Food Coffee on the
table and it was made good and strong,
ke some >â { the weak, thin stuff
some people make and think they are
_: "real Postum'; he supposed
it was regular berry coffee, and when
! to take a cup. did so, remarking
that hÂ» fflt the need of some kir.d of a,
stimulant like coffee, but that he be-
lieved it always had a bad effect on
him. aa in about an hour after drinking
it he had a queer Bensatlon about his
heart and stomach, and always felt
worse than ho did before drinking it,
but. that he did not see how he could
S.n^ without something of the
kind.
"We said nothing about the Postum
Pood <'<ffee and the iv>xt evening
about the same time Uncle canie in
again, very unexpectedly, and in his
business-iik" manner immediately in-
quired what brand of coffee we used.
He said. "I did not have any of that
queer after sensation last night after
drinking your coffee, and I want to
know what kind it is.'
"We then told liim it was Postum
Food Coffee, and that we were using it
because the other coffee did not agree
with some of us and that the Postum
did, and we all felt better from it.
T'ncle is now enthusiastic in his praise
of Postum. Many people, like him, have
perhaps \>r<-n told of Postum, or have
read about it, but are either too sus-
picious or too busy to examine into the
fajcts, but when on<- nalizes the tre-
mendous importance of health, he
Phould glvo this subject his first atten-
tion." Jno. Legg Jr., 1728 Bolton St.,

The structure will be of brick an I
be in every way an adornment to the

side of the building is concerned, it Is
to the purpose of the place that the peo
ple object, and their objection la all the

just such a place as has made the flashy

arouse t(,. -rthern district here,
and the public officials must sldr- in with

of this city and we cannot have such a
place established in the heart of a section
where there are thousands of children.
It wil! Ik- tli. nigg. <; fight ever seen in
this city if they try to establish such a

without end until the place has been

section will bo enlisted in the ncht against
it. and it must fail. These men who are
backing t!.- have already applied
to the Supervisors for n permit in order
to give color of authority to their enter

they cannot carry on Buch a business.
The Twinkling Star Improvement Com
pany was Incorporated ":i March '.
with L. P. E. Frey, S. P. Blumenberg,
Emil Kehrlein, W. 'I. Richards and Val
entine H. Kebrlein as directors. 'Die com
pany Is formed on the basis of tlir. ,â  thou
sand shares at ?.Vi each and at the time
of incorporating each director had sub
scribed one share. The property on which
the building is to be erected is understood
to belong to Blumenberg and his mother.
"I have heard outlined the plans for
this building," said Chief Lees last night.
"The Police Department has no Jurisdic
tion over it yet. as the proposed building
has not been erected, and consequently
no laws are being violated there. The
plans of a house for illicit purposes are
only visionary and may never be carried
t.i completion. They may be changed and
a building erected in which some legiti
mate business may be transacted. \W
have no right to make any stand in the
premises at present."
Killed by a Train
An unknown man was found on the
bfH line track on : East street, between
Green and Union streets, early this morn
ing- horribly mangled. He apparently had
been sleeping on the track when a train
of empty freight cars which had pulled
out twenty-live minutes before struck him
and ercund him almost to pieces. H.
was about 60 years of age and had a gray
beard. The body was taken to the
Morgue.

REAR ADMIRAL
WATSON STARTS
FOR THE WAR
He Will Meet Admiral
Dewey at Manila.
TROUBLE ON THE VALENCIA
ALMOST A RIOT AMONG THE
DRUNKEN FIREMEN.
P. C. Coffin Spent Nineteen Years on
Pitcaim â Arrived Here on the
Galilee on His First
Visit.
The Mail Company's steamer City of
Peking sailed for the Orient via Hono
lulu yesterday with a big crowd of pas
senirers and all the cargo she could carry.
Hundreds of people were down to see her
away, and they had a long wait, as It was
nearly 3 p. m. before she left the dock.
Among tn^ passengers were Admiral
Watson and Lieutenant Marble, U. R. N.
They if" to .Manila, where Admiral Wat
son will take command of the Asiatic
station, relieving Admiral Dewey. lieu
tenant Marble will be Admiral Watson's
flag lieutenant. There was a big crowd
down to Bee the distinguished sailor
away. Mrs. Watson, her two sons and
two daughters and her brother, Critten
den Thornton, were among the number,
and they waved their adieus until the
Peking disappeared around the wharves.
As the mail steamer moved away from
the wharf Admiral Watson took his place
on the bridge # bcslde Captain Tremaine
Smith, and answered all the salutes from
i he shore. When the steamer was
â straightened out for her run down the
bay three Idng blasts were given on the
-team whistle as a good-by to the shore.
Commander Merry, I.'. S. N., was also
a passenger on the Peking. Ho is going
tn Honolulu to take charge of the coaling
station.
S"ine of the delay In the sailing of the
Peking was caused by Agent Center and
Chief Clerk Avery. At 1 p. m.. the ap
pointed hour of departure. Lieutenant
Bchwerin gave orders for everybody to
k-o ashore, but Messrs, ("enter and Avery
remained aboard to say good-by nni-e
again to their friends. It was not until
the Bteamer was out In the stream that
they discovered they were on their way
to Honolulu. A tugboat had then to be
summoned to put them ashore.
The brig Galilee arrived from Tahiti
last Monday night after a fair passage
of thirty days. She brought up six pas
:-â¢ tigers, among whom was V, C. Coffin,
the undertaker of Pltcalrn Island. About
nineteen years ago Mr. Coffin was a sailor
on the British ship Arcadia. That vessel
was wrecked on Duce Island and the
captain and crew made their way to Pit
cairn in the boats. When the British
man-of-war made her usual visit to the
island all the men left the island save
Coffin, who had taken unto himself a
wife For nineteen years he lived among
the islanders, and this is his first visit
to the mainland. He brings up a number
of relies from the Bounty. Pieces of the
Old ship are still preserved by the de
scendants of the mutineers, and some of
the most Interesting are now in the pos
session of Mr. Coffin.
There was almost a riot on the trans
port Valencia, and a posse of police had
to be called in to quell the disturbance.
Ii appears that the firemen had a number
of grievances during the voyage to Ma
nila and back, and yesterday they tried
to even up matters with Chief Engineer
Pierson and First Assistant Williams.
The firemen had been drinking, and
wanted to give the engineers a beat-
Ing but the engineers made their escape
Into the chief's room. While waiting for
them to come out the firemen, began fight
ing among themselves, and when the
'I'iartermasters interfered they beat the
quartermasters.
First Assistant Williams watched his
opportunity, and slipping over the side
ran up the wharf and summoned the po
lice. Sergeant Rrophy and Officers Shaw
and Lake responded, but when they
reached the scene the Valencia was betn^
I across the dock to another wharl.
The firemen saw the officers coming, and
when the steamer got alongside they
made a nm for it and got away. They
were to have been paid off yestejday af
ternoon, but that longed-for event was
postponed until to-day.
John Desmond, mate of the steamer
Modoe, had several ribs broken aboard
the vessel yesterday. A piece of machin
ery was being shipped, when the guide
rope slipped and the heavy piece of iron
swunp inboard and struck the mate in
the chest. Tie was removed to the Har- :
bor Hospital,, where Dr. Hopper attend- j
ed to him. Later he was removed to the;
French Hospital.
William Bulger, t ho sailor -who had his
skull fractured on the steamer Alice
Blanchard last Saturday, died In the j
Harbor Hospital yesterday afternoon.
The wonder is how* Bulger lived sn long,
as nearly half his brains were dashed out
when he was injured by a falling piece of
iron.
The British ship Belfast arrived from i
Calcutta yesterday with grain sacks.
This is the vessel San Francisco parties |
were so anxious to purchase, but she was |
bought over their heads in London. After i
sh<> came to anchor off Folsom street I
wharf the Belfast began to drift and she
was nearly on the Alameda mud flats
before her anchors brought her up.
The schooner Bowhead returned to port
yesterday. On May 6 she started for Bris- |
tol Bay, but was caught in an unusually
heavy storm off Fort Bragg and carried
away her foremast head. She had to come
back for repairs.
The transport Grant took the Centen- :
nial's place at Folsom street wharf yes- ;
terday. It tnok a number of tugs to push j
her up into her berth at the wharf.
Captain McNeal, late of the barkentine
S. G. Wilder, has taken command of the
barkentine Planter, vice Captain Marden, j
who has taken a Government position.
Death of Rev. S. Sanford.
Rev. S. I* Sanford, father of Assembly
man J. B. Sanford of Ukiah, died at the |
German Hospital this morning at 12:45 I
o'clock. Deceased was a prominent Bap- |
tist divine, and was for a number of years ,
moderator of the Clear Lake Baptist As- \
soclation. He had been sick for some six |
months and was brought to this city on
Friday morning for treatment. He leaves 1
three sons and two daughters. The body
will be taken to Ukiah to-morrow for in- |
terment.

CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simp'e but Safi and Ef- j
feetu I Cure fo- It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long: been j
considered the next thlnpr to incurable.
The usual symptoms are a full or. bloat- j
ing sensation after eating, accompanied
with sour or watery usings, a formation
of gases causing a pressure on the heart
and lungs, and difficult breathing; head-
aches, fickle appetite, nervousness' and a I
generally played out, languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste in the mouth,
coated tongue, and if the interior of the
stomach could be seen it would show a :
slimy, Inflamed condition.
The cure fnr this common and obstinate j
trouble is found in a treatment which j
causes the food to be readily, thoroughly i
digested before it has time to ferment
and irritate the delicate mucous surface
of the stomach. To secure prompt and
healthy digestion is the one necessary
thing to do and when normal digestion ;
is secured the catarrhal condition will j
have disappeared.
According to Dr. Harlanson the safest â 
and best treatment is to use after each I
meal a tablet composed of Diastase,
Aseptic. PtÂ»psln, a little Nux, Golden Seal
and fruit acids. These tablets can now
be found at all drug stores under the ;
name of Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets and
not being a patent medicine can be used 1
with perfect safety and assurance that |
healthy appetite will follow their regular j
use after meals.
Mr. N. J. Booher, of 2710 Dearborn St.,
Chicago, 111., says: "Catarrh is a local
condition resulting .from a neglected cold
in the head, whereby the lining membrane
of the nose becomes inflamed and the poi- â 
sonous discharge therefrom passing back-
ward into the throat reaches the stomach,
thus producing catarrh of the stomach. >
Medical authorities prescribed for me for
three years for catarrh of the stomach 1
without cure, but to-day I am the hap-
piest of men after using only one box of :
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I cannot find
appropriate words to express my good
feeling. I have flesh, appetite and sound
rest from their use."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the safest |
as well as the simplest and most conven- j
ient remedy for any lorm of indigestion,
catarrh of the stomach, biliousness, sour !
stomach, heartburn and bloating after
meals.
Send for little book, mailed free, on
stomach troubles, by addressing F. A.
Stuart Co., Marshall. Mich. The tablets
can be found at all drug stores. y

OAKLAND HOW
AWAITING A
CHRISTIAN ARMY
Endeavorers Ready to
Meet Thousands.
DETAILS OF THE CONVENTION
OLD TABERNACLE IS NOW A
THING OF BEAUTY.
All the Committees Hare Their Work I
Perfected and Three Great and
Profitable Days .Are
Expected.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, May 16.
The old barn at Twelfth aiul Harrison
streets has disappeared. The decorating
committee of the Christian Endeavorers j
took hold of the place as soon as the ',
golden carnival closed and rapidly trans
formed it into a large, picturesque con
vention hall. There is not an inch of tho
old lumber to be seen, wlhile the rear of
the building has been generously cut
down Hid lengthened to provide for the )
orchestra and to accommodate the chorus |
of 4 "' voices.
No State convention of the Christian
Endeavorers has ever had the pleasure of
conducting its sessions in a more elab
orately planned or prettier hall than will
the convention which will commence its ,
labors next Thursday morning. All the
prettiest booths of the carnival have been I
utilized by the Endeavorers. and the large j
annex is like a piece of fairyland, and j
the convention of '99 will be historic in
the- annals of Christian Endeavor gath
erings.
The registration committee has pre
pared to receive 5000 visitors, many of I
whom will doubtless make their homes in |
San Francisco during the three days the
convention is in session. In the hall is a !
large registration booth* where W. Nat
Friend will bend to the guests as they
arrive and attend to their disposal. He
hap the record of every place in Oak
land where a comfortable bed or a pala- j
table meal can be discovered, and this ;
cheering news will be given to all the del- j
egates as fast as they apply.
The arrangement of details for large i
conventions has become a science with
the Christian Endeavorers, and they can
handle large crowds as easily as small j
ones. All the arrangements in the Expo
sition building are perfect in their details,
oven to the point of the numbered ten
penny nails driven in planks to accommo
date the headgear of the orchestra,
Hundreds of electric lights and thou
sands of yards of the gold and purpleâ
Endeavorer colorsâ adorn the interior of
the building, and the whole has been car- |
peted, so that the late-comer or early- i
goer with his heavy shoes cannot have j
the satisfaction of annoying four thou- j
sand people.
To-night the grand concert was given, :
and the full value of the huge sounding
board, specially constructed for the con
vention, was tested and proved a perfect
success. The executive committee is con
lident that when "Father" Clark, the
founder of the movement, calls the con- |
vention to order on Thursday morning ,
he will truthfully declare that the build
ing is the most complete and tastefully
adorned in which any Christian Endeavor 1
conventions have been held.

pleted, is as follow?:

TOPHAM FREE.
HIS WIFE ALSO
SEEKS FREEDOM
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
ad way, May 16.
W. E. Topham. who collected over $2000
of the money of the Berkeley Electric
Lighting Company, waa discharged to
day by Judge Quinn. It has been evident
i<iT some weeks that there was no de
sire to press the charges, and it is pre-
Burned tnai Topham'a lather, who has on
former occasions come to his son's relief,
baa mollified the surety company that in
stituted the proceedings.
Topham had barely i *-f t the courtroom
when \.<- was served with a suit for di-
This is tho third time Topham has been
In trouble and out. At San Jose and in
San Francisco he was In difficulty and
lils father relieved him. About four years
a*.-" he married a young woman of San
JOBe and a little later h" Bettled in Berke
ley and was given a position by the light
any. A few months uro it was dls
red that he was short in his ac
â -. and be confessed to President
Britton that he had taken some of the
funds. He was arrested and has -been in
jail about three months.
A t<w weeks apv Mrs. Topham sold the
h"m<- al Berkeley and went to San Fran
cisco to reside I 'mil recently she showed
unbounded confidence in her husband and
was his frequent visitor at the jail. Not
for a lonj? tim<- would sh" believe that he
had done anything wrong, but she has
apparently realized the truth, for this
afternoon her attorney filed a suit for dl
vorce, alii ging statutory offenses on the
"part 'â ?' Topham.
FACTORY GIRLS STRIKE.
Shirt Makers Objected to a Notice
Posted Begarding Vacations.
OAKLAND, May It"..â The young ladies j
at Keller's shirt factory on Washington :
like to talk and when a notice was
posted that conversation during working
hours musi be very limited the eighteen
Ltors on the shirt machines held a
rue and inaugurated a strike. They
another grievance besides their <>Â»po- |
Bitlon to silence. There is a big rush of I
work on hand and the forewoman gave
notice that no vacation requests would be
.-.red until after July 4. This hard
ship could not be tolerated and on Satur
day night the eighteen operators decided
to take their vacations then and there.
Monday morning they did not appear and
M J. Keller was at a loss to understand i
why the ticking in the workroom had !
ceased. Let* r In the day the young la
dies called at the store. There was an
I sting conversation for about an j
tour, at the end of which time none of j
the young ladles could tell why they had
quit" and all declared that there was
nothing in all the world so pleasant as
silence and not one of them would dream
of entertaining the idea of asking for a
vacation before the sth of July in any
event.
The walkout of the eighteen operators
threw a hundred sewers, trimmers and
laundry workers out of employment, but
the strike was of pu^h short duration and
bo happily compromised that it had no re
sult.
FRATERNITY HOME
A MASS OF RUINS
FIRE DESTROYS PHI DELTA
THETA CHAPTER HOUSE.
BERKELEY. May 16.â The large chap
ter house of the Phi Delta Theta frater
nity, standing on the corner of Dana
street and Durant avenue, was com
pletely burned to the ground late to
night. The blaze started In the northeast
corner of the upper story shortly after
10 o'clock. It was some time before the.
alarm was turned in, and the flames had
gathered considerable headway before the
Fire Department arrived. The firemen
fought the blaze until after midnight, but
scarcely any of the building now remains.
Most of the furniture nave that on the
third lloor was saved.
The house was the property of the fra
ternity men. it having been purchased by
them last summer at a cost of J.O'jO. All
the fraternity's paraphernalia, with the
secret records since 1873. were destroyed.
Insurance covers the loss to the extent of
$3000.
COMPANIONS OF THE FOREST.
No Longer Any Feeling Between the
Companions and Friends of
the Forest.
At the session of the Grand Circle of
| the Companions of the Forest yesterday
M. Rofhm. high chief ranger of the An
i cient Order of Foresters, was created past
chief grand companion, in consideration
of his services to the order.
Several years ago, when the Grand Cir
cle was In session at Ukiah, there was a
division In regard to a proposition that
was presented, and it resulted in a num
ber of the delegates withdrawing. Those
who seceded formed another order, called
the Friends of the Forest, that carries
on the objects of the Companions, .viz., j
I the giving to members physican and j
j medicine, and to beneficiaries a sum in ;
j payment of funeral expenses. For a time i
there was antagonism between the two I
j organizations, and at the outset the Com- I
i panions declared that no member of the
Friends could Join the Companions, and
that no Companion could join the Friends,
except under penalty of expulsion. In
time, it appearing that there was no In
, terest in common between the two organ
j izations, the rule was modified, and the
i high chief ranger, who affiliates with the
i Friends, was admitted as a member of
; one of the circles of the Companions, and
yesterday the honor conferred followed.
One of the prominent members of the
Companions said that the Companions
.; having become satisfied that the Prlenda
; were not working under the same ritual
las the Companions, had no longer any
i objection to members of either order Join-
I ing the other If they so desired.
Later in the day all the recommenda
tions of the committee to whicli had been
j referred the proposed amendments were
adopted. The proposition to deprive past
grand chief companions of a vote in the
Grand Circle was lost; the one to allow
social members funeral benefits was car
ried; one to affect the right of honorary
members to hold certain office? w;.< d< -
'â  feated; circles not having a physician are
! allowed to pay members a Btated amount
I in lieu of doctor and medicine, and there
' was an amendment passed that no mem
ber who Is a member of the funeral fund,
i who has paid assessments In thai fund,
I can be dopjlved of benefits of the fund
: until suspended in the circle for cause.
The per capita tax was allowed to re
main as last year, at fiO cuts.
The election of officers will be held to
' day. The present chief companion will
not he a candidate for re-election.
Last evening the supreme grand officers
â  and the delegates enjoyed a banquet, and
after the menu there was a feast of song,
music and recitation, with responses to
toasts by High Chief Ranger M. Boehm,

REAL ESTATE
MARKET IS
VERY QUIET.
Noticeable Falling Off
in Transfers.
PLAINT OF THE DEALERS
SAY OWNERS ARE WITHDRAW
ING OFFERINGS.
General Feeling Is That a Revival of
Activity Is Imminent â Mission
Street Property to Be
Sold at Auction.
The stagnation in the real estate
market, so far as actual transac
| tlons are concerned, continues, al
! though dealers are generally sanguine j
of an early , revival, based upon the
! abundance of money seeking invest
ment in income-producing properties. The
claim of the real estate men that the
present hiatus is due to the withdrawal
! of property from the market which fol- i
lowed the recent spasmodic activity in the
wholesale district, owners concluding to
hold on to what they were convinced
must L>e good things because of the ap- j
parently unprecedented demand will be |
put to the test to-day when A. M. Speck
, â¢.â * Co. will offer at auction a choice busi- '
n< ss lot and improvements at the south- I
east corner of Fourth and Mission streets.
The property, which Is in the heart of the
retail district, should prove an attractive
bait for the many would-be investors who
are said to be swarming over town look
ing for bargains. The property is in
cumbered by a mortgage of $35.iw0. held
by the Hibernia Hank, and the buyer will
have the privilege of assuming the obli- !
I gation. At the same time Speck & Co. j
i will offer for sale the double lot at 22 i
and 24 Turk street, between Mason and j
'â  Taylor, 34:4^4X137:6, with two stores and
a twenty-eight room lodging house, and i
subject to a mortgage; a Mission business !
: . and residence lots, improved, in ]
all parts of the city.
Easton, Eldridge & Co. sold a number
of pieces of real estate at auction yester
day. Including a ten-room residence at
2502 Washington street, i'or 15800; eight
room residence at 8817 Union street, for
a six-room cottage at 3325 Twenty
first street, for $2ooO; eleven-room tene
ment house at 128 and 130 Twenty-ninth
street, for $3500; four i.,us at 254 and 2i>ti
Shipley ptreet, for $2300, and an unim
proved lot on Western avenue, near Point
Loboa avenue, for SG7S.
The repaying of the streets In the dis
trict east of Kearny street and north of i
1 California ! be now practically j
assun-, i. The action of the Board of Su- !
pervisora in appropriating $50,000 toward
the work, the property-owners to raise!
the balance, is to b< immediately followed â +
by the necessary preliminaries, so that
the actual work of paving may be begun
as soon as the appropriation is available. I
To be sure, the Mayor's signature is yet
sary before the appropriation may
i.. said to be a fact, but there Is little j
apprehension <>n that score, and the |
North Central Improvement Association !
Is going right ahead securing the signa
of the owners of abutting property.
The appropriation will come out of the
next tax levy, but nevertheless it is ex
-1 pected thai great progress will have been
made toward putting that section of the
â  city in a fairly passable condition before
â  next fall. The streets will be paved with
1 basalt Mocks if the present intentions are
carried out. with the exception of places
(He is comparatively light. In
the latter case bitumen will probably be
; the material used. It is believed that
. when the street improvements are com
plete,) aii'l the question of rapid transit
' i:i the wholesale section of the city is
i solved, a general revival in business and
church. Following the ceremony the^
guests partook of an elaborate wed- â¢
ding banquet. â ' %
The bride is one of the most popu- 9
lar and accomplished members of X
Alameda's younger social set. She is Â«j>
a descendant of a celebrated family X
of musicians, her grandfather being ,*>
founder of the firm of Lindeman 6
Bros, of New York, known through- <Â«>

Instruments. . <Â§>
Mr. Browne is cashier of the Flint o

FORAGE BIDS REJECTED.
Supervisors Decide to Readvertise on
Account of an Informality.
At the meeting of the Hoard of Super
visors on Monday the Fire Department
Committee will present a report recom
mending that all bids for supplying for
age for the Flro Department and public
Institutions for the coming fiscal year
be rejected and that new bids be called
for. This action was decided on at a
meeting of the Fire Department Commit
tee held yesterday.
Those present at the meeting yesterday
were Chairman Heyer and Supervisors
Kalbin, Collins. Phelps and Holland. The
bids for supplying forage were submitted
to the board in open session more than
a month ago and were suhmitted to the
Fire Department Committee for award.
They were considered by the committee
at its meeting on April 25. but for some
reason not stated final consideration was
postponed for two weeks. In the mean
time one of the bidders, the firm of Scott
& Magner, filed a written protest against
the committee awarding the contract to
the lowest bidder. Daniel Keefe for the
alleged reason that Keefe is not a dealer
in hay and straw, has no barn and does
not keep a supply of hay in stock as re
quired by the terms of the specifications.
The difference between the bid of Scott
& Magner and that of Keefe may be seen
by a glance at the following table of
the prices quoted by each:
Scott & Magner. Keefe.
Oat and wheat hay, mix
ed, per ton $13 90 $1100
Wheat hay, per ton 13 87 11 00
Oat hay, per ton 13 87 10 50
Rran, per 100 pounds BE US
Carrots, per 100 pounds 80 54
Chief Sullivan, who was present at the
committee meeting, informed the mem
bers of the committee that Keefe had for
a number of years been supplying the,
Fire Department with grain under con
tract, and had given full satisfaction in
every way. The committee agreed to rec
ommend that all bids be rejected, this
being the only method by which they
could accomplish their determination to
reject the bid of Mr. Keefe. The objec
tion to Keefe's bid was based on the al
legation that he was not a dealer in hay
and straw.

FIFTY GAMBLING DENS
OPEN IN CHINATOWN
Fantan and Lottery Are Played
Without Interference.
Peace Reigns Through the New Police
Scheme and Mongolians Are
Correspondingly Happy.
GAMBLING in Chinatown has
been suppressed â the police say.
A most effective plan has been
conceived and carried to suc
cessful conclusionâ the police
fay.
rgeanl Donovan and his squad did
in one night what the whole depart
ment failed to accomplish in yearsâ the
police say.
In aJI this Chinese gamblers vocifer
ously acquiesceâ and then an almond
eye's Hd droops.
Just who originated this wonderful
plan of campaign has run boon made
public. Thief Lees has not assumed
the responsibility nor has Lieutenant
Ksola, and Sergeant Donovan surely
would no* take credit from his su
periors.
Possibly some member of the Chinese
Gambling House Association could
name the brilliant mind whose lucu
brations brought forth the Idea of pay-
Ing stated semi-hourly visits to the
dens where t lie gay Mongolian was
wont to disport himself in the entiling
games of fantan and pai-gow, for it
is a gn at Bcheme â for the Chinamen.
Th.- flfty-flve gambling-houses in tlr-
Chinese quarter of the city never did
a larger business in their history and
never before, even in th>Mr palmiest
days, were they subjected to so little
molestation.
With a firoat flourish of trumpets it
was announced that with the re
tirement of Lieutenant* Price in dis
from Chinatown peaceful meth
had immediately accomplished
what raids with axes had failed to
bring about. It was Buch a simple plan
that people wondered that it had never
been tried before. All that was neces
sary was to divide the Chinatown
squad into sub-squads of two and then

start an official merry-po-round amnnc
the clubs, every door being opened
every half-hour to admit two officers,
whose lynx eyes detected nothing' but
a few disconsolate Chinese mourning
over thi'ir lost occupations.
It is a beautiful scheme â on paper â
but it lacks one element to make it a
glittering successâ it is impossible.
There are fifty-five known gambling
houses in Chinatown and many others
thai are not on the list. Sergeant
Donovan has six men in his squad. A
little bit <'f arithmetic will at once
demonstrate the impossibility of car
rying out the plan bo elaborately set
forth as the solution to the Chinese
gambling question.
it the Bquad of two were to go the
rounds <â ;' these iifty-flve gambllnc
houses on a fast walk it would take
them at least live minutes for each
place, or 275 minutes t<> make the
rounds. There being three squads there
would be an hour between the visit of
th<- first and tin- last squad. Two hun
dred and seventy-five minutes equal
four hours and thirty-live minutes, and
of necessity there would be three hours
and thirty-five minutes between the
visit ft' the last squad and the second
visit of the first squad. In other words
were the squads to cany out the pro
gramme faithfully the gamblers would
have three and a half hours of unin
terrupted playing between squad visits.
Bo much for the proposition of the
feasibility of the plan. There is an
other side to the question. If the
Chinatown squad spends its time chas
ing the rounds of the gambling-houses
they have no time to attend to other
police business In that section of the
city, nor do they have time to stand
on the corners talking. If the Bquad
mak< s regular visits to the various
houses it goes without saying that the
Chinese can tell time as well as their
white brethren and they know exactly
when to expect an official visit. This j
was conclusively shown last night when
a reporter went to the doors of several
of the gambling- houses five minutes
before the squad arrived and invariably
found tjiem locked. When the officers
reached the doors they swung open
as if by magic. Five minutes after the
police had taken their departure the
doors were again found locked by the
reporter. At one place, 714 Dupont
street, the officers were even so oblig
ing as to wait for a few seconds in the
tauter doorway.
Wong Fook's place, on the northwest
corner of Jackson and Dupont streets,
was not visited during the whole even
ing. But Wong Fook is one of the
most influential of all Chinese gam
blers. Neither were Chin <'hung's two
places on Spofford alley Visited, not
withstanding the fact that his place on
St. Louis alley was raided the night be
fore â a raid that brought a water haul.
At the corner of Jackson street and
Washington alley is a club which is
duly Incorporated by the State as a
"social and literary" association. Just
why a social and literary club should
take the precautions observed at this
place is not clear. To reach the inner
room â the sanctum sanctorumâ it is
;â¢ - â¢ 3sary to enter the outer door, the
inner door, two inside doors, go down
a flight <>f steps and pass through a
door which opens toward you, only to
be confronted by a massive door four
Inches thick, double bolted and barred,
and then you are in a sort of eating
room. Of! this is a little room appar
entlj used as a cloak room. This is
wainscoted to the ceiling, and the
walls are seemingly solid. A peculiar
touch in one corner develops the fact
that there is a hidden door which opens
into a dark anteroom, from which you
enter into a dismal cellar apartment.
Here is a fantan table, and if you are
one of the elect you may play to your
heart's content while the officers are
getting through the various doors
nine in all â before reaching the place.
< iff this room is a small closet about
four by six feet. It also has a most
solid appearance. The walls are heavy
boards, and around the center runs a
heavy panel studded with spikes. But
here, also, appearances are deceiving.
One of these spikes is removable, and
the whole side of the closet can be
raised, revealing an opening into a
dark tunnel which leads into an alley
on one side and into the Jackson street
theater on the other.
Strange and devious ways to get out
of a social and literary clubroom.
In the rooms at 714 Dupont street a
game of pai-gow was in progress when
the tinkling of a bell announced the
â¢ fining of the squad. Instantly the
money around the table found its way
into the pockets of the respective own
ers, the dominoes were shuffled to the
middle of the table and then divided
out between four players, and by the
time the police entered the room four
Chinamen were playing an Innocent
game of dominoes and two others were
reading the papers. The police depart
ed, and from various rooms the players
emerged, and within one minute pai
gow was In progress again as if BUch
a thing as police interference was
never heard of.
At 13 St. Louis alley Is the room of
the Fook Ta.i Lottery Company, and at
:â '.!â¢ Washington alley is the room of the
Ming Lay Chow lottery. Two weeks
ago these two lotteries opened wide,
Hnd at any hour of the. day business is
dono openly. During the drawings
chinamen go in and out freely, and a
hig business is done every day. Last
night there was no effort to hide the
fact that a drawing was going on, and
whil* 1 white men were barred Chinese
could come and go at will.
The new seherne is very effective. No
more doors are 'battered down with
axes and no more Chinese are carted
off to the station to. answer to the
charge of gambling. It is a great
schemeâ for OhlrÂ«?RÂ° e p Â»''*Â»W*rs.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, MAT 17, 1899.
APOLOGIES FOR .
HUNTINGTON'S
BANQUET TALK
Stanford a Thorn in
the Flesh.
THE MAGNATE'S NARROWNESS
GOOD RAILROAD MONEY PUT IN
HIGHER EDUCATION.
Comment on a Speech Recently De
livered by the President
of the Southern
The versatile Collls P. TTiintington was
not satisfied with the lauroJs which he
gained as an after-dinner speaker at the
Palace Hotel banquet, so he made an
other speech on the occasion of the return
banquet last Saturday evening. The tirst
effort, a broad invitation for the Russian
Finns to settle on railroad land In Cali
fornia, did not enlist widespread atten
tion; but his second speech, a declaration
against ton much education, has excited
tlie wrath of college professors and other
advocates of the highest and most elab
orate educational embellishments.
Two evening papers of San Francisco
yesterday sought to break the force of
the clamor against the Huntington
speech and square the magnate in the
eyes of the college-bred men. In what
may be classed as a semi-apology for the
speech ii is contended that Huntington
did not declaim against higher education,
but only Bpoke againsi misfit education.
It is noted that David Starr Jordan,
president of Stanford University, Is
among the liist t<> challenge the correct
ness of the Huntingdon position. No
where in Dr. Jordan's response is any
allusion made to the blesÃingÃ conferred
by the late Leland Stanford in devoting
a fortune acquired in railroading; to the
establishment <>t a great institution of
learning, and nowhere in Mr. Hunting
ton's speech is any reference made to the
squandering >>f k" 1 "' railroad money to
overeducate the youth of the land. The
mind-reader who is abroad, however,
knows that Huntingdon as well as Jor
dan employed language to conceal
thought, and that both were thinking uf
the Stanford educational institution.
One of the apologistic evening papers
is of the opinion that Huntingdon is a
broad man. It is the fashion for every
one on the Southern Pacific payroll to
speak of Mr. Huntington as a man of
broad views and strong character. The
magnate's strength of character is not
disputed, but the notion that the presi
dent, of the Southern Pacific is given to
â  ntertainment of broad views is not
justified by his letters to the late Colonel
Colton, or by the revised proofs of bid
recent after-dinner speeches. The Col
ton correspondence shows clearly that
Huntington is crafty, suspicious and
coarseâ coarse to the verge of downright
vulgarity. He was a successful merchant
In Sacramento, and is to-day a successful
railroad man: but if a misfit system of
education had not diverted his genius to
mercantile pursuits and railroading
he might have achieved world-wide re
nown as a detective. His mission in
"Washington required him to know what
his rival. Tom Scott, was doing, but he
was not obliged to trace around the jew
elry houses Of New York to ascertain
how much money Governor Stanford paid
for jewelry.
A Californian who was acquainted with
five of the railroad magnatesâ the five
mentioned in one of Colonel Colton's
breezy letters to C. P. Huntingtonâex
presses the opinion that Stanford was the
only broad-minded man of the quintet.
Colton was courageous and entertaining.
Charles Crocker possessed gre;u energy
and individual force. Mark Hopkins was
close and economical. Huntington was
crafty. cunning and industrious. In
Washington and New York he was up
against cunning Bchemes and hence his
mind was turned to counter scheme and
plot in order to protect the interests of
his corporation. His letters do not indi
cate that be was familiar with the broad
Intellectual life of Washington. Leland
Stanford, while dull in some respects, was
broad In his general views of the world
and the Inhabitants thereof. He had
Ideas concerning the betterment of man
kind and the sincerity of his views was
attested when he gave a vast fortune to
endow :l noble institution of learning.
Stanford's measure of wealth was the
power to do good. Stanford placed a high

READY FOR THE KILLING.
Sea Lion Hunters Prepared to Raid
the Big Rookeries.
About thp latter part of this week the
deputies of the Fish Commission will
makp a raid upon the rookerips of the
Bed lions of the Farallon Islands. This
squad will be headed by Al Wilson, the
veteran rifle shot and expert fisher. The
party will be gonp about two weeks ac
cording to present calculations. As It will
be necessary under the conditions im
posed by the Government officials to see
that nonp of the dead animals remain on
the shore, most of the shooting will be
done at the sea lions swimming in thÂ«
water. It is believed that by making nn
attack upon the herd at this' timp of the
year the chances of destroying many will
be greater than at any other time.
As soon as the Wilson party starts for
the islands, another party under the di
rection of Captain Scott will start for the
rookeries at Ann Nuevo down the coast,
where the seals find excellent breeding
grounds. The captain Is an old seal hun
t'T and the commission believes he will
assist greatly in thinning out thp herd
at that point. Hp will he, accompanied
by a couple of sailors who will assist in
removing the dead animals from the
shore and kelp, tho same regulations ap
plying to that of the lighthouse reserva
tion as to the Farallon Islands.

FRAGLEY ACCUSED OF
LEVYING ON HIS MEN
The Supervisors to Investigate
Serious Charges.
Street Superintendent Alleged to Be in
the Habit of Collecting Assess
ments From Employes.
IF the Information that has been con
veyed to the members of the Board
of Supervisors Is true. Superintend
ent Of Streets Martin Fragley is des
tined to have many exceedingly uncom
fortable moments In the near future.
This information is in effect that Mr.
Fragle>' has levied and is even now levy
ing forced contributions on every man
| employed in the Street Department, no
| matter in what capacity, and It Is so cir
i eumstantial that t*ie Supervisors have
| called a special joint meeting of the Fl-
I nance and the Street committees to make
la thorough investigation. Every employe
j and attache of the department has been
summoned to appear as a witness lie
fore the. joint committee next Friday, the
date set for the beginning of the investi
gation.
As there are several hundred employes
of the department, including Inside and
] outside deputies, laborers, bricklayers.
i sewer builders, teamsters, corporation
: yard employes, etc., and the Supervisors
' will alsn endeavor to secure the testimony
â  Of former employes and men wlio have
, sought to obtain employment in the de-
I partment as well, the investigation bids
! fair to occupy the greater portion if not
all of noxt week, as the City Fathers are
determined that the whole truth shall be
brought out.
Rumors of this nature in connection
With the Street Department have been in
j circulation for some time, and when they
I finally reached the ears of the Supervisors
Perrault and AJgeJtinger, as chairmen of
the Finance and Street committees. ri<-
I termined to exercise their rights under
| an old law and hold an investigation. This
! was deemed all the more necessary Bince
: the disclosures made during the recent
trial of Peter McGlade, showing the lax
j manner in which the department has been
; conducted In the past.
The information that hns reached the
i Supervisors is in substance that Mr. Frag
ley has been in the habit of demanding
j â and collecting, tooâ a percentage of each
i mans pay, the usual rate being $1 for
| each day's work during the month.
It is stated that what satisfied the Su
pervisors that Mr. Fragley was really
swelling his private income in this manner
were complaints made by certain men
recommended to the Street Superintend
i ent by members of the board for employ
ment" For years it has been customary
for that official to extend to the Supervis

sent friends to Mr. Fragley. and were sur
prised to have them return with the
statement that they would not go to work

ing to his statement, that he could go to
work at an approximate salary of $S0 a
month, but that he would have to give $30
of it to the Superintendent.
"But, Mr. Fragley." was the reply, "I
have a family to support, and how do you
expect me to keep my wife and buy shoes
for the baby on $50 a month?"
"Well." the official is accredited with
replying, "when I was a young man I
lived on that amount and supported my
family, too."
The applicant for work would not ac
cept the terms, and related his woes to a
Supervisor.
Laborers, it is charged, who toll on the
streets or in the depths of the sewers at
$,'! a day, are expected to turn over $1 of
the amount to the head of the depart
ment, as are also men who own a horse
and cart whh h they hire to the city, to
gether with their own labor, and for
which they are allowed $4 a day, pay $1
for the privilege of working, and strive
to feed themselves, their families and

teams are said to pay more, likewise the
deputies, inspectors and other better paid
employes.
With 3TK) men working an average of
twenty days in the month, if the charges
against Mr. Fragley are substantiated,
he will be shown to have derived a hand

None of the Supervisors will discuss the
matter more than to admit that the
charges are sufficiently definite to war

ALL PRECINCTS

Promise of the Local
Democracy.
A good part of the local Democracy Is
waiting to see what the next meeting of
the committee of one hundred will bring
forth. The time for the meeting has not
yet been set, nor has there been any def
inite outline of business discussed by
those who wish things to go Bmoothly
and quietly. The Democratic situation
is in a state of expectant suspense, and
only the meeting will throw light on the
matters the wise ones are debating. But
e%-en with all this it is denied that the
meeting will be of any importance. It
will be for the purpose of apportioning
delegates, is the answer to all who may
ask why. but it is from this very question
of delegates that the situation takes its
keenest interest.
The first real move in local affairs Dem
ocratic has come from the State Central
Committee. The committee, in referring
to delegates to municipal conventions,
and perhaps to the work of the commit
tee of one hundred a year ago, advises
that delegates be apportioned 10 the pre
cincts, one to each, or three to each vot
ing precinct. It was at first the idea of
the committee of one hundred to allow
the faithful to vote a blanket ticket that
would lighten their labors at the primary
polls and materially assist the aris
tocratic administration to have things
its own way. as heretofore. But all that
was a year* ago. The faithful have been
to school since then, and they have ben
to the hardest school of all â the school
of experience. The State Central Com
mittee saw it first, and the adivce to the
committee of one hundred was the result.
The party will not stand another deal
such as it got a year ago. and so the
committee of one hundred was asked to
yield a point and forego the blanket
ticket in favor of precinct representation.
Precinct representation goes, therefore,
not because the State Central Committee
asked it, it is carefully explained, but be
cause it "would be better so." Precinct
representation goes, but there is nothing
to define the term representation, and
may not a precinct be represented by a
neighboring purist as well as one to the
manor. born? A good worker for the elite
tvho can move and establish a residence.
as well as a good worker for the rank
and file who lives in his own home and
objects to a change? Besides it is de
clared, "The Stat" Central Committee
cannot dictate to the committee of one
hundred." It may advise, but no one is
bound by that advice. It may suggest,
but the suggestion need only be received
politely.
I'nder the new primary law there is no
way set forth in which the delegates must
be apportioned. It is required that the
manner of apportioning the delegates
must be described, but that is all. The
sudden willingness of the kidgloved to
allow precinct representation is therefore
not based on any demand of the law.
Within a month and with equal legality
it was decided to submit a blanket ticket
to the enthusiastic, but as the enthusi
asm has become somewhat dimmed the
purpose of the aristocracy has become
broader until it now is announced that
every precinct will have a representative.
"Will he live in the precinct? ' is the nat
ural question, and the answer is. 1 sup
pose he will"; but beyond this supposi
tion there is a world or uncertainty.
Under the law the delegates may be
apportioned to the various precincts at a
certain ratio, but the delegates may still
be at large. They may number up to a
total that will give each precinct at least
one, and perhaps more, but there is noth
ing to prevent every one of these dele
gates from coming from the same pre
cinct if the apportioning power only has
the nerve to call them from so small a
section. That is what makes the pro-
Bosed precinct representation of the com
mittee nf one hundred so indefinite and
unsatisfactory.
The committee of one hundred can do
as it pleases and no one can say it "nay."
but there is a mural limit, and it ha^
manifested Itself so far in the reduction
from the hlanket ticket to the precinct
