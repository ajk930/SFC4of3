BAR HARBOR, Me., Aug. 6.â Lieutenant
John R. Edic, if. S. N., made a call upon
the beautiful young widow, Mrs. Cornelia
Baxter Tevis, at her cottage here one
evening a week ago. Asa sequel" to the
visit the lieutenant is now undergoing a
court-martial, after having endeavored to
participate in a duel with Ernest A. Wilt

Mrs. Tevis, whose husband was a Cali
fornia millionaire and who is now only 20
years old, declares that Lieutenant Edie
offered her certain insults. Captain Emery
of the Indiana and a board of officers are
seeking 1 to discover to what extent, 'if at

The affair has caused a most emphatic

hold them until to-morrow. That they
are not escapes Is positively known.
When Roberts was arrested in Davls
ville the officers suspected tb,at he lied
about Howard and that the latter was
making his way westward through the
brush that lines the bank of Putah Creek.
The officers at Winters were notified just
before noon to-day that a man answering
the description of Howard entered Put
ker's drug store and made a purchase.
Putker, who has a picture of Howard,
notified the Constable as aoon as he could
be found. In the. meantime the suspect
disappeared In the brush along the creek.
Constable Warder after some delay struck
the trail and followed It to Pleasant Val
ley, where the suspect left the creek and
turned Into Pleasant Valley, going In the
direction of Vacaville and Suisun. War
der then returned to Winters and re
ported. A posse was sent out from Sulsun
and another from Vacaville to Suisun
with the hope of intercepting the suspect.
Dave Colburn, a young farmer, living
east of Wopdland. drove to the Sheriff's
office about 9 o'clock to-night and re
ported that a -Sacramento posse Is trailing
a man supposed to be Howard along the
old canal between Sacramento and Wood
land.
The inevitable state of depression fol
lowing the period of exaltation came to
day, and Roberts had a civil word for
nobody. To-morrow, the practiced officers
figure out, will come a renewal of the
craving for the drug and then, as one of
the Sheriff's posse, expressed It to-night,
"Roberts will tell the secrets of every
member of his family back to his great
grandmother if the prospect of more opi
um Is held out to him."
If there Is one man at the county Jail
In whom Roberts will confide it is Dep
uty Sheriff Timothy Haggerty, fourteen
years an officer at the Folsom prison and
a man with whom the convict has always
been on good terms. In fact, Roberts,
despite his uncommunicative mood,' has
already conferred with his former keep
er, and he told him a circumstance -which
has thus far been kept a profound secret.
Roberts has informed Haggerty that
when Convict Gordon left the band of es
capes at Mormon Island It was with a
white face betokening the agony he was
suffering from a bullet wound inflicted by-
Guard Tommy Ryan, who played such a
conspicuous part in the events following
the outbreak of the prisoners. Roberts
told Haggerty that Gordon simply said,
"Boys. I'm shot, and I'm going to leave
you here," and that he then disappeared.
Roberts says he does not believe Gordon
â¢was seriously injured, but was suffering
pain from a wound In the leg or arm.
Haggerty, who has known Roberts for
years, expresses the utmost confidence in
the truth of the latter's statement with
respect to Gordon's wound.

Roberts refuses to see any newspaper
men and the officers will not force him
to, do so. His story given to The Call at
Davisville, in which he detailed his move
ments, is the only one which he has thus
far vouchsafed the press. Roberts clings
to his plea of innocence of a/iy greater
crime than breaking prison with a tenac
ity which leads the officers to believe that
he has never learned of the death of
Guard William I* Cotter, the result of the
conspiracy in which he was a prime fac
tor. He said to-day that he was not
worrying himself as the worst they could
do to ' him would be to take away his
credits at the prison. At the same time
he rather plumed himself upon the fact
that he had been selected by his fellow
convicts to carry the sticks of dynamite
with which it was proposed to blow open
the armory if tnllder means failed.
Sheriff David Reese returned from the
Webber Creek country this morning. He
states that the bloodhounds were unable
to find a good trail of the convicls, who
have been seen there several times in the
past week. Reese said it had been deter
mined that if the hounds failed to find the
scent to-day they would be sent to Shin
gle Springs and . put on the trail, of the
man supposed to be Convict Case, who
ate supper at a hotel there last Monday
night. Reese states he does not believe
Case has been at Shingle Springs, and
Sheriff Bosquit of El Dorado is also skep
tical of the report.
Roberts was given two hou'rs of quizzing
this afternoon, but very little Information
was wrung from him. What the meager
information was neither Reese nor Sey
mour would divulge.
htf:- REFUSES TO - TALK.
When Haggerty and several other dep
uties reached the neighborhood â¢ Howard
had disappeared, and has ever since elud
ed the pursuers. Haggerty looks for no
repetition of the Roberts experience when
the capture of Howard Is attempted.
Howard, declare all who. know him, will
make a fight for his life so long as he
is able to handle a weapon. He has as
saulted every officer at Folsom prison
who has sought to punish him, and dog
ged brutality is written on his counte
nance and manifest In his face and gen
eral demeanor. Roberts does not present
a heroic appearance physically, but How
ard, with his broad shoulders and fierce
manner, has long prided himself upon his
superior prowess at the penitentiary from
which he escaped.
BELIEVE ROBERTS IS LYING.
Sheriff Reese, his son. Edward Reese,
Deputy George Wlttenbrock and Con
stable M. Judge made a search of the
brush along the banks of the Sacramento
River on the' Yolo and Sacramento sides
and below this city for a distance of sev
eral miles this afternoon in the hope of
finding Howard, but their ettorta were
not rewarded with success. They returned
to this city to-night without having found
the slightest trace of the man they are
seeking.
Sheriff Reese and the officers under him
do not accept Roberts' statement that
Howard left him at Agricultural Park last
Tuesday, since which time the two fugi
tives have not met. Roberts has said
that when Howard separated from, him he
said he waa going toward Worth, Nev.,
where he has a brother-in-law employed
by the Southern Pacific Company. The of
ficers believe Roberts is shielding How
ard, a belief strengthened by the report
from a reliable source that Howard was
seen in Yolo County last evening, west of.
the Yolo bridge.
The prison authorities want Roberts re
turned to the prison without delay, but
Sheriff Reese and District Attorney Sey
mour will probably keep him here three
or four days and subject him to daily
"sweatings" In order to gain full Informa
tion from him as to the movements and
whereabouts of the other members of the
escaped convict' band.

Sheriff Haggerty said to The Call cor
respondent to-night that he is certain he.
would have captured Howard if he could
have acted at once upon trustworthy in
formation brought to him before sunset
yesterday. Howard was seen sitting un
der a tree at the time of day mentioned
at a point about a mile west of the Yolo
bridge. Beside him lay a rifle, while at
the moment he was examining a revolver
which he had taken from- the prison
armory post.

In the case of Springer It was shown
that C. L. Westlake and William Blake,
the pickets, had fired simultaneously on
Springer. The young men were exoner

Springer was killed accidentally by the
pickets in the performance of their duty.
The fugitive convicts tre being closely

news of a battle between the convicts and

TRAINMEN GIVE VALUABLE AID TO OFFICEBS.
After the train stopped at Auburn Engineer Waters "no
ticed a man sitting alongside of the track. Waters got ,off his
engine, and going closer saw that the man was a negro. Waters
asked him where he was going and was answered, "Oh, I'm go
ing harvesting over in Nevada."
Operator Schnitzius then telegraphed the train dispatcher
at Sacramento asking permission to hold the train until the of
ficers could arrive.
' The trainmen played their part well, for it was fully twenty
minutes before the officers arrived, and the residents overlook
ing the station were none the wiser that Seavis was in their
midst until after the shots were fired.
Beyond saying that he was Seavis and begging not to be
killed the negro refused to say anything. He stubbornly re
fused to be interviewed.
His wounds were dressed at- the iail and he Was then
Coming up to his man Keena then asked, "Is this Seavis?"

effect in Seavis' right leg and the wound was paining him in

convict ha<Uhrown away.
A large crowd soon gathered and willing hands con
veyed the fellow to the jail.
According to Brakeman Hair Seavis got on the pusher
engine at Newcastle, four miles below Auburn. He was seen
on the road about three hundred yards below that station, but
evidently could not get on until the train slowed up.

"This man started to walk down the
track away from the . freight train, and
as our train speeded up I could see him
slinking along."
i'As we slowed down crossing. the. draw

gage coach truck and started down the
track. We were running then toward
Benicia. It was at 8:45 o'clock this morn-
Ing. The man pulled his hat down over
his face and had his coat collar turned
up. He was smooth shaven, wore a
brown slouch hat and a brownish coat.
His hair was cut short and I couldn't tell
what color it wfca. He appeared to be
about 5 feet 7 or 8 Inches tall and weighed
about 160 or 170 pounds. He had a promi
nent nose.
"I was within six feet of him and had
a good look at the man. who acted so
suspiciously that I could not help but
observe him. It was the cry from the
freight train men that must have scared
him out from under the car. I am.' sure
he was not an ordinary 'hobo,' because
they will not get out unless driven away
by force.

' DOAN'S KIDNEY PILLS.
TO BE DEPENDED ON.
Because it In the Experience of a
San Francisco CltUen'and Can
Readily Be Inveatlffated.
A stranger lost in a large city would
place far more dependence on the direc-
tions given him by a local resident than
the guidance of another stranger Â¦ like
himself. This Is a natural consequence
of experience. It's like a ship In a
strange portâ a trusty pilot familiar with
the harbor is always called upon to bring
her safely to her moorings. So it is with
Indorsement: we doubt the sayings of
people living at distant points because
we can't investigate, but public expres-
sion' of local citizens can be depended on,
for 'tis an easy matter to prove It. Evi-
dence * Ilka the following- Is beyond dis-
pute: . .
B. Edgecomb of 934 Mission street says:
"I knew from the condition and the ac-
tion of the secretions from my kidneys
that those organs were . not doing their
work completely or as satisfactorily ' as
I wished. I tried different medicines, but
without any effect, or If any it was so
unappreciable that I could, not notice it.
It was different with Doan's Kidney. Pills.
They do not act on the bowels, but act
directly upon the kidneys, soothing,
strengthening and purifying them so that
they perform their functions properly. ?

LOS ANGELES', Aug. 6.â The Lowa
special over the Santa Fe Railroad, which
left Chicago at 10:15 yesterday morning
for this city, is breaking all transcon^
nental records. The schedule, as ar
ranged, called for a run between Chicago
and Los Angeles, a distance of 2265 miles,
in sixty-one hours. Up to 5:45 this even
ing, at which hour the special reached
Albuquerque, three hours and fifteen min
utes had been gained. If the same ratio
of gain la maintained for the remainder
of the journey the special should reach
Los Angeles in about fifty-six hours. It

the Peacock special, which. In March.

the purpose of enabling Peacock to attend
the meeting of the directors of -the big

The discrimination against Wilson &
Co. was not relished by the league mem
bers, and when a reply to the proposition
made by the league for a settlement was
received at the Builders'. Exchange, de
manding that the proposed settlement
must be made at once and not within ten
days, as specified, the league decided to
withdraw the whole plan and stand on
the original ground, which demands that
the workmen of all trades return to work
.on the Wilson contracts on exactly the
same conditions as existed before the
strike began, and thatMhe question of em
ploying union workmen, as well as, wa go
scales, would be taken up and arbitrated
PITTSBURG. Pa., Aug. 6.â Unexpected
developments in the peace move of the
Builders' Exchange League caused a new
break in thp plan for general operations
next weok. ' After the proposals for the
ending of the lockout had been sent to
the Building Trades Council yesterday,
which stipulated that the league should
employ only union .hoisting engineers
pending a settlement of the scale, it was
discovered that with one exception not a
contractor in the city was employing un
ion engineers as such, nor had they recog
nized the Hoisting Engineers' Union. No
attention had been paid to the other con
tractors by the workmen, -but they sin
gled out A. & S. Wilson as the firm to.at
tack and compel the signing of the union
scale before any. one else.
NEW YORK, Aug. 6.â Following a
weak, almost panicky, opening, to-day's
stock' market suddenly reversed Its
course, substantial gains beini; registered
by practically all the better class securi

about 2 points. In some instances gains
were much' greater. New York Central
led the active list with a net- gain oi 3?&-
The change of front which occurred in
the. early trading was doubtless duo to
several reasons, the most potent of which
was the "good" buying whlc*i seemed to
emanate from high quarters. There is
little., room for doubt that stocks, were
purchased j freely ; to-day by Insidersâ by
banks, : banking houses, financial institu
tions generally /and wealthy individuals
because they sfeemed cheep. No justifica
tion-could be found for thÂ» report rather
industriously circulated that the Vander

their host "of followers, had entered upon
a planUo lift prices. As a matter of f.\ct,'
no ; little part "of to-day's â¢ Improvement
was undoubtedly due to extensive cover

the; market as being very much ovetsijld.
Despite the marked improvement, further

SPOKANE. Aug. 6.â A romance extend
ing over a quarter of a century comes
to a happy climax next Wednesday, when
Weldon Brinton Heyburn, United States
Senator from Idaho, will marry Miss
Gheratine Yeatman of Chester County,
Pa. Years ago young Heyburn met Miss
Yeatman. like himself, a Pennsylvanlan
of Quaker ancestry, and they became
friends. In 1884 the young lawyer came
West and settled in Idaho. He became a
leader lat the bar, acquired wealth and
last winter became United States Sen
ator; but he did not forget the Quaker
girl. Now he has gone East and it is an
nounced they are to be. married next
Wednesday, probably at the home of the
bride's mother. A wedding trip to Spo
kane and Alaska will follow.
Engineers will cross the Tuba to-mor
row and from the foot of C street will run
a direct line to Sacramento. The survey
from Oroville to Marysville is completed.
The work was very carefully done, grade
stakes were set and It is believed that the
survey is intended to be permanent. Prior
to this a preliminary line was run be
tween these two points, and the conclu
sion is reached that the same plan will be
followed In running the line to Sacra
mento. The work being done now will
very likely be gone over again and some
slight changes made before the route is
permanently established. By the time the
gap is closed between this city and Sacra
mento it is figured that practically the
entire survey from Beckwith Pass to San
Francisco will have been completed.
There is no longer any question in the
minds of the people of this section that
the Western Pacific people mean business
and that the enterprise is backed by large
capital. Some of the surveys in â¢ the
mountainous district above Oroville were
gone over six times In an effort to estab
lish easy grades, and every Indication
points to the fact that tbe"^rork Is being
thoroughly done regardless of expense.,.
The corps of surveyors here is made up
of fourteen people. There are thirteen
similar crews scattered along the line
from San Francisco to Salt Lake City,
and they are rushing the work to comple
tion as expeditlously as possible. So far
as learned no steps have been taken by
the company regarding a site for a depot
and wharehouse at this point. Â¦
WILLITS, Aug. Â«.â The Santa Fe Rail
road has sent out another large body, of
engineers to-day, from here on the ter
minal work for their line north of here.
This Is the third large ,party; that, has
been equipped here In the last few weeks.
MARTSVILLE, Aug. 6.â The Western
Pacific corps of surveyors who have been
camped here for the past week finished
their work in this city to-day. The line
as run passes from a point between the
two cemeteries near the northern bound
ary of the city limits straight south on C
street ita entire length. C street is one
of the principal thoroughfares of the city,
but those who are familiar with the sit
uation nay that the present survey does
not necessarily mean that the new rail
road company intends to ask for a fran
chise ( to lay tracks on this street The
surrounding country is practically level,
and the line as far as this city is con
cerned is believed to be simply a prelim
inary survey, from which to make esti
mates and which may be changed later
on.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.. Aug' 6.âAt
torneys W. H. Phelps of the Missouri
Pacific and John H. Carroll of the Bur
lington were before the Cole County
Grand Jury to-day. They spent only a
short time before that body, and the gen
eral Impression is that they gave but
Â¦little information of value. It is impos
sible to learn along what line their evi
dence was Riven.
Elmer E. * Phlpps of Kansas City, a
former member of the House of Repre
sentatives, and Dr. A. G. Hildreth, a
member from Adair County, were the
other witnesses examined. The latter
was a member of the committee which
Investigated charges made by Speaker
Whitecotton that boodling existed in the
House in connection with the textbook
bill. It is believed his testimony related
to that investigation.
It has been learned that the Grand Jury
is investigating a report that an attempt
was made to secure money from brew
ers to effect thfe passage of the beer com
promise bill by which brewers were re
leased from paying fines for violation of
the beer inspection law on the condition
that they pay a stipulated sum into the
State treasury and obey the law in\he
future. Tony Stuever, C. J. Lemp and
Philip Stock, St. Louis brewers, were be
fore the Grand Jury this afternoon and
are supposed to have given testimony on
the matter.
J. W. Hensley, Representative from
Gasconade County, was also a witness.
He was a member of the committee ap
pointed to Investigate the contract labor
system at the penitentiary, and it is sup
posed he was questioned regarding- at
tempts to hold up contractors at the pris
on. Hensley resigned from the commit
tee, stating that he was not permitted
to see evidence taken by that body.
Speaker Whitecotton, who made charges
on the floor of the House that boodle
was used in the textbook legislation, and
which charges started the boodle Inves
tigation, appeared before the Grand Jury.
Former Lieutenant Governor John A.
Lee was again a witness. It Is believed
he identified the Lee-Kelley telegrams
and told of the transactions to which
they related. He broke down while in
the Jury-room and wept, and it was some
time before he could regain composure
and continue his testimony.
Superintendent Payne of the Postal Tel
egraph Company reported to Judge Hazell
this afternoon that his company could
find no messages ! handled between for
mer Lieutenant Governor John A. Lee
and D. J. Kelley, the baking powder leg
islative agent, in either Jefferson City or
St. Louis offices. ,
Superintendent Frankel of the Western
Union Telegraph Company submitted
some telegrams handled by that company.
Judge Hazell examined the telegrams to
decide if they should go before the Grand
Jury. Certain of ' these he ordered pre

SANTA ROSA. Aug. 6.â The report of
the Sonoma County Horticultural Com

condition of crops in this county. A ,pest
hitherto unknown here is In the Dry

the county. It is described as a snout
beetle, which bores into the wood about
three-quarters of an inch, going in from
the north and east sides of the trees, op
posite from other boring insects. The at
tack is seldom made more than four feet
from the ground, and the trunk and large
branches are the parts most affected. The
infect has not been identified, but its ori

8Cme time during Sunday night a chargs
of dynamite must have been placed under
the cabin and touched off. Pieces of tha
cabin were blown for a distance of a
mile, and the first thing that struck thÂ»
packers was to ascertain whether or not
Egbert had been in the cabin. The men
made a careful search of the surround
ings, but found no trace of a body. It is
still unknown if Egbert was in his cabin
at the time of the explosion. His friends
believe, however, that he was not in tna
hut, but the fact that his whereabouts
has not been ascertained has caused m
strong suspicion that he was asleep Irj
the cabin at the time. A vigilant searc>|
is being made to locate Egbert, and if nd
is not found within the next few days a m
other search of the surroundings will be*
made.
One day last week a cabin belonging t<*
a miner named Shale, who also reside^
near Gold Lake, was burned while thÂ©
owner was absent. Shale was in Downier
ville at the time and is satisfied that tha
fire was of incendiary origin.
NEVADA CITY. Aug. 6.â Miners around
Gold Lake. Sierra County, are greatly
excited over criminal happenings there.
On Sunday night a log cabin at Gold Lake
owned and occupied by John Egbert was
blown up with dynamite. The report was
so loud that it was heard at Basseta sta
tion, six miles from Gold Lake, and a tel
ephone query was sent to Sierra City ask
ing if any of the powder-houses around
there had been blown up. Monday morn
ing packers who visit the Gold Lake coun
try regularly were surprised to see that
the Egbert cabin was blown to atoms.
Nothing remained but â¢ some splintered
wood to indicate where the cabin had
stood.

The police believe that Mr. Hodge can
materially assist them in solving certain
feature connected with the murder and
will communicate with him at once.
Mrs. Hodge persistently refuses to give
any information as to the identity of her
accomplice. A picture in Mrs. Hodge"s
effects has been identified as that of a
man who was seen in company Â¦with
Ryan and Mrs. Hodge a few days before
the murder. Mrs Hodge at first said the
picture was that of her husband. This
she now denies. The police believe this
man was the accomplice and have reason
to believe that he ; s in Mexico.
Chief of Police Burbldge to-day received
a letter from Cornelius Hodge, the hus
band of the woman who has" confessed
to the shooting of Ryan. The letter Is
dated Hieh Grove, Cal.. and contains an
inquiry us to the facts connected with

SALT LAKE. Utah; Aug. 6.â Mr*. Au
rora Hodge, who confessed in Grand
Rapids, Mich., that she was implicated in
the murder of William X. Ryan, an aged
fpecta.de peddler, near Murray, Utah, a
few weeks ago, and who has been
brought here for trial, has considerably
modified the statement she first made in
regard to the killing- and now declares
she did not fire the ehot that killed Ryan.
Ryan's remains were exhumed yesterday
and a large bullet hole was found in the
top of th* head;' When Mrs. Hodge was
told of this sheappeared much surprised.
She said to her attorneys:
If he died from that wound I did not kill
him. I admit that I ehot at him, but I do not
admit that I killed him. I tied Ms hands over
by the big tree, but he rot loosÂ« and started

at him. I fired at his side.' It would have
be*>n impossible for me to shoot him la the

ROME, Aug. 6.â The coronation cere

from the latter part of the fourteenth
century. As the Pope enters the church
a clerk of the papal chapel holds up be
fore him a reed surmounted by a handful

a moment, and then dies out at once, as
the chaplain chants:
"Holy father, thus passeth away the
world's glory."
This Is done three times. The mass is
then begun as usual, but before the ln

Pontiff-elect Is announced by three Car

Cardinal Gibbons, accompanied by his
conclavist, Father P. C. Gavin, to-day
visited the church of Santa Maria in
Trastavere, the Cardinal's titular church.
He was warmly received by. the whole
chapter, headed by the canon and arch
priest.
The election of Cardinal Sarto as Pope has
aroused Indescribable enthusiasm here. The
people are preparing splendid festivities which
have been unanimously approved by the city
fathers. The village, being almost entirely
composed of peasants, has no idea about .the
policy or tendencies of Pope Pius, and I 'am
unable to give you any Information on that
point. He was of the humblest birth.

Plus X has appointed his conclavist,
Monsignor Bressan, as his private chap

consistory on the Thursday following.
The Mayor of Riese, the birthplace of
the new Pope, in replying to an inquiry,

ROME, Aug. 6.â During one full hour
this morning there seemed to be nothing
but vibrating sounds, so penetrating were
the strokes of the bells of about 500
churches which, all ringing together, ab
sorbed all other noises. The ringing was
In honor of the election of Pius Xâ a wel
come unique of its kind and ordered by
Cardinal Resphigl, vicar of Rome, who
issued special instructions therefor. All
of the churches contemporaneously cel
ebrated masses for the event, the Inton
ing of the Oremus combining with the
harmony. The bells Involuntarily served
another purposeâ that of ringing In the
great ceremony of the reception of the
diplomatic body accredited to the Holy
See. Rome has lately been surfeited with
Vatican functions, but that of this morn
ing was so striking that lt held Its own
with the others.
The members of the Sacred College
gathered before the hour set for the cer
emony and held an informal reception,
the conclave, short as it was, having
brought them cordially together. A pro
cession was then formed. First came ths
Swiss Guards, which give a peculiarly
medieval splendor to all papal gather
ings; then the. Palatine. Guard, followed
in irregular ranks by the whole pontifical
court, in its multiform and multi-colored
costumes, the Cardinals in all the gor
geousness of their scarlet robes, and the
Bishops scarcely less striking in their
purple. The Pope, in spotless white, his
gray hair in harmony with his whole at
tire, and surrounded by the Noble Guard,
who always remain near his person, went
on foot, just as the others.
The procession having gained the Hall
of the Throne, where the members of the
diplomatic body were gathered, Senhor
d'Antas, the Portuguese Embassador, the
dean of the corps, read in a clear voice
the collective greeting of his colleagues,
presenting their homage to the new Pope
and assuring him of their fidelity. Plus
X answered with great cordiality, thank

tiff being credited with having taken
small interest in affairs outside of Italy.
It was another surprise to them to hear
him speak French, if not fluently, at
least with a certain readiness. Altogether
the whole audience gave promise of a
new era of international cordiality at the
Vatican.
Pius X Shows Knowledge of Inter
national Affairs. '
POPE RECEIVES DIPLOMATS.
It is now certain that his archeplscopal
ring was redeemed from a Venice pawn
shop the day before his departure for
Rome. Early in almost every month,
after expending all of his money on char
ity. Cardinal Sarto used to pledge his
archepiscopal ring at a pawnshop, where
lt often remained for considerable time.
Cardinal Gibbons and a party of Ameri
cans were awaiting the Pope in the Vati
can gardens to-day, and upon the Pon
tiff's arrival Cardinal Gibbons offered to
kiss his hand, but Pius X, amid the warm
plaudits of the party, kissed the Cardinal
and embraced him affectionately.
The new Pope made several departures
from time-honored customs, which con
vinces all that his reign will be most pro
gressive. The Pope is surprising the
whole Vatican world by his great sim
plicity and objection to luxury. He has
discarded all. of the ceremonial and. pomp
which had attained such a remarkable
degree of development during the pontifi
cate of his predecessor.
It is almost certain that he will abolish
the greater number of posts now existing
at the papal court, and it is said he In
tends to abolish absolutely the corps of
Noble Guards, which consists of seventy
five titled members of the Roman aris
tocracy, who form the Pope's guard of
honor when he goes to his apartments.
He declines to be escorted by the Noble
Guards or the Palatine Guards.
Pope Pius has decided that no stands
shall be erected for his coronation In St.
Peter"8. Consequently, contrary to cus
tcm, there will be no places reserved for
members of royal families nor for the
Roman aristocracy. In making known his
decision in this matter the Pope said:
"In the church all Christians are equal
before God."
Pope Pius X dined to-day with his
friend Domperosl, a noted composer. This
was a great surprise, as from time imme.
mortal it has been the custom of Popes
to dine alone.
ROME. Aug. 6.â The attention of Rome
is now centered upon the solemn corona
tion ceremony which is to occur on Sun
day, and for which great preparations are
being made. The throne of St. Peter,
which Pius X will occupy, will be sur
mounted by a canopy forty feet high.
The function will consume five hours. The
Pope has informed the Vatican officials
that he wishes to be received on the
threshold of the basilica by Cardinal
Rampolla. who, as archpriest of the
churcn, will address the formal greeting
to him. At the conclusion of the cere
mony the Pope will confer his blessing
upon the people, but lt has not yet been
decided whether he will do bo inside the
church or from the balcony looking out
upon the piazza, where many hoped he
would bestow his benediction on the day
of his election. It is said that Pius Is
favorable to the latter plan, but that the
influence of the Vatican officials Is
against it, on the ground that it might be
interpreted as a recognition of the pres
ent state of affairs in Italy. The holding
of the coronation ceremonies in St. Pe
ter's Itself represents a concession, as in
the case of Leo it occurred In the Sistine
Chapel. Although it is expected that
60.000 tickets will be issued for the event,
the demand for them is already very
great.
In the consistories to be held on Mon
day and Thursday next the Pope will
confer the red hat upon Cardinals Ajuti,
Taliani, Katschthaler and Herrero y Es
pinosa, who were elevated on June 25, but
who have not yet received these symbols
of rank because of the Illness and death
of Leo XIII.
It is believed that the Spanish Cardinal,
Herrero, will not be able to be present at
the coronation ceremonies.

A special. to the News from Ferry Park,
Colo., a resort for tourists, located about
forty-five miles south of Denver, says
I'EXVER. Aug. 6.â Details of the storm
which prevailed along the eastern slope
cvf the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and
Southern Wyoming last night show It to
Imve been much ir.ore severe than at first
reported. In pome sections the hail fall
Â¦waj unprecedented. In the neighborhood
tf Grecley m<i Katon. in the northern
part of Colorado, chunks of ice, measur
ing:, in some instances?, ten inches In
length, fell, and the damage wrought was
immense. Bheep wore struck dead in the
corrals and cattle and horyes were se
verely injured. Farm houses and barns
nre wrecked and crops utterly wiped
out cf existence.
Near Greeley a man named Johnson
was severely bruised and rendered un
conscious by the. hall. The damage can
not be csiin:ated in that section, but â¢will
reach thousands of dollars. Near Lafay
ette, Colo., there were two storms, the
second following: the first within fifteen
minutes and with great severity. The
streets of the town were flooded, cellars
j-.artially filled with water and trees and
shrubbery stripped of foliage. Many v>\n
dovjs were broken. The crops In the
country surrounding were destroyed. Hail
lay on the ground in many places to a
â¢lepth of two feet. The damage in and
around Lafayette Js estimated at $200,000.
In Southern Colorado the rainfall was
very heavy, approaching the proportions
of a cloudburst in several places. Rail
road traffic was stopped on .the Kio
<Â«rande for some time by washouts. The
Santa Fe was also seriously affected.
deacon takes off the miter, which until
now the Pope has worn, and then the sen
ior Cardinal deacon (Macchi) places the
tiara on his head and all the people cry
out "Kyrie elelson."
The Pope reckons his pontificate from
his coronation day, although, of course,
he is Pope from the day of his election.

THE tearful appeal of Harpers' Weekly that Mr.
Bryan be treated with tenderness and respect
by the Democratic press is responded to with
derision. The Democratic press, especially that of the
South, seems to count as lost that day whose low,
descending sun marks a snoot at Bryan left un
snooted. In that section of which he was the primate
in politics he is now basted for his impudence, lam
basted for his weak and pretentious leadership, ad
vised to go way back and sit down, to clap a stopper
on his jawing tackle, mind his own business, go into
the political rag bag, and in other phrases expressive
of extreme contempt to let politics alone and go at
something for which he is qualified.
The outbreak of resentment is extreme. The Gold
Democrats in the last two campaigns expressed
themselves as to Mr. Bryan in terms that could not
be called fond or languishing, but which now loom
up as flattery in contrast to what is being said of
him by his supporters in those two battles. Un
fortunately for Mr. Bryan these pins stick him where
his quick is quickest, for his vanity and self-esteem
amount to' an intellectual eczema.
But, turning to the party in whose behalf Bryan
is now being harried, we find that the same organs
were doing the same to Mr. Cleveland in 1896 and
four years later. It proves its incapacity for admin
istration of national affairs by regularly choosing and
as regularly shooting down its leaders. The hero of
to-day is the poltroon *of to-morrow; the idol of to
morrow is Teproached for having clay feet the next
day. The country never knows on what to depend in
the aspect and case of that party. It defies prophecy
as to what it will do. Perhaps it has lost its mind
and these erratic courses are due to that misfortune.
One thing is sureâ the people, who have interests at
stake in a consistent policy and the stability of gov
ernment, don't want the Government to fall into the
keeping of a party that either does not know its own
mind or has no mind to know.
BRYAN ON THE TOBOGGAN.
There can be no valid objection to the enforcement
of the law in that way. for if after the first condemoa.
There has been a strenuous effort to prejudice the
public mind against the act ever since it was made
known.. We have been told that it would injure this
or that foreign country, and that the injured would
retaliate. Furthermore, it has been declared that the
adulterated or falsely marked goods are not harm
ful and that it will be an injustice to exclude such
products from foreign countries when we permit the
sale of similar products of domestic manufacture.
Such statements should not be permitted to dis
credit the act in the public mind. There will be no
harm done to any fair commercial interest. Dr.
Wiley of the Chemical Bureau of the Department of
Agriculture, who will have charge of the inspection
of the suspected goods, has recently refuted some of
the sensational statements concerning the act. In
the course of his interview on the subject he said: "It
is the policy of the department not to obstruct or
irritate trade. We shall bar no kind of goods on
mere suspicion, and even in the case of actual adul
terations, in the first instance, the goods will be al
lowed to enter. In fact, in Secretary Wilson's let
ter, sent yesterday in regard' to expected consign
ments, it was distinctly stated that the department did
not ask that the cargoes be denied admission, but
that they should be. allowed entry, the samples taken
and the goods pass on out of the custom-house.
In a second offering of any articles that may be
found to be adulterated we shall refine entry and
compel the consignee to destroy the goods or ship
them out of the country."
Â£> ECRETARY WILSON of the Department of
Agriculture has applied to the Secretary of the
Treasury for authority to hold up the cargoes of
twenty ships now on their way to New York for the
purpose of inspecting such portions of them as come
within the scope of the pure food law. It is therefore
evident that the act prohibiting the importation of
impure or falsely labeled foodstuffs, medicines and
wines from foreign countries is to be rigorously en-
We may now expect an outcry from the American
importers as well as from the foreign producers and
shippers of such articles. The enforcement of the
act is going to interfere with what has been an ex
tensive trade, and of course somebody is going to
be hurt. It may be taken for granted, however, that
no legitimate industry or interest will suffer, and
such protests as arise will be no more than another
proof that "no rogue e'er felt the halter draw with
good opinion of the law."

It is to be borne in mind that the United Repub
lican League does not stand for a faction in the party,
but for the whole party. The men whom it proposes
as delegates are unpledged and untrammeled. They
will, if elected, go to the convention bound to no
man nor to any set of men, and will have upon them
no other obligation than that of faithfully nominat
ing a party ticket that will win because it deserves
For many years the better elements of the people
made a fight for pure primaries and the enactment of
1 law vÂ« 'hich would place primary elections under of
ficial sanction. That law has now been obtained. It
remains to be seen whether they will profit by it.
Apathy and indifference on the part of any consid
erable number of good citizens will give the bosses
a chance to win out even under the law. It is therefore
imperative that the workingmen, the business men
and the professional men of the city rouse them
felves and take part in the contest. The United
Republican League has prepared the way for a good
convention and a strong ticket Now let all loyal
Republicans do their duty and in every district we
shall have a victory for honest politics that will go
far toward assuring a sweeping victory' for the party
in November.
ON Tuesday next the primary elections will be
held. Delegates elected at the primaries will
nominate candidates for city and county of
fice?. To assure good candidates it is necessary to
elect honest, public-spirited men as delegates to the
nominating conventions. That much is known to
every citizen. It is also known that the bosses and
their followers, who are in politics for the spoils,
will spare no pains to elect their henchmen as dele
gates in order that they may nominate men of their
choice. They can be deieated only by the votes of
good citizens in each party. It therefore behooves
all good men to begin to take an interest in the con
test and to fix in their minds a resolution to go to
the primaries on Tuesday and vote right.
The great parties and the several factions of each
party have put tickets in the field. The personnel of
each arid all of the tickets should be scrutinized care
fully, for the issue involved in the contest is that of the
election of men who can be counted on to nomi
nate no man for any office unless he is fitted to fill
it. Therefore the character and the reputation of the
men who have been nominated as delegates are the
dominant factors in the contest. It is a question
whether we shall have nominations made by inde
pendent and responsible citizens, or by men under
the domination of the bosses and bound to take or
ders and make nominations as the bosses dictate.
In the Republican party a good ticket has been
nominated in every district by the United Republi
can LÂ«&-ue. The Call has published these tickets in
full in order that the list of names might be care
fully studied by the voters. Each and every one of
those tickets can safely challenge criticism. They
have been carefully made up and are thoroughly rep
resentative of all sections of our citizenship. There
is not one among them that does not deserve the
snpport of loyal Republicans, and that support should
STAND BY THE TICKET.
Outsiders find it difficult to understand the flurry,
and even those on the inside are apparently at a loss
to comprehend the forces that have caused it. Thus,
after each succeeding slump and failure, there have
come assurances from men intimately acquainted with
Wall street that the worst was over and that things
would immediately brighten. Even Russell Sage
gave out an interview after the first shock informing
the public that the lowest level had been reached
and that the reaction would come at once. As he
closed his interview with the announcement, "Now is
the time to buy," there may be a suspicion that he was
talking mainly for the purpose of holding up prices
until he could'sell out; but there are other authori
ties to whom no such suspicion attaches who were
equally sanguine.
Immediately after the failure in which Keene was
involved the New York Tribune made extensive in
quiries among bankers for an expression of financial
sentiment, and found everywhere buoyant words, if
not a buoyant feeling. One of the clearest statements
on the subject was made by a representative of J.
W. Seligman & Co., who said: "The recent severe
liquidation has imparted a feeling of safety and se
curity not only among the careful banking interests,
but with the prudent and sensible public. Conditions
which brought about the liquidation did not result
from any fear of tight money, but simply from over
speculation. The feeling of hopelessness that pre
vailed until a few days ago has been dispelled, and
investment orders for high-class securities have come
from strong parties. Fully $10,000,000 to $20,000,000
of European capital has been sent here for invest
ment within the last week. The ruling rates for long
time money indicate, in my judgment, that a money
stringency in the fall is most improbable. It is hardly
likely that we will increase our indebtedness to Eu
rope this year. I can say definitely, by way of assur
ance, that in case there should be any squeeze dur
ing the next two months the Treasury Department
will offer prompt relief to 7 legitimate financial in
terests."
In that statement we have assurances that ought to
calm the street if it be true that nothing serious is
the matter. With money coming in from Europe
at the rate of something like $20,000,000 a week, and
with a fair guarantee that the treasury will again save
the situation if need be, the country can watch the
flurry without excitement, and it seems the street it
self ought to brace up. However, it is probable that
the time has come for squeezing the water out of a
good many stocks, and those who have speculated too
far must pay the price of their folly.
MORE trouble in Wall street. Despite the
prosperity of the country, despite the rush
of business on every railroad and in the of
fices and shops of well-nigh every corporation whose
stock is listed on the exchange, Wall street con
tinues to bubble and squeak like a teapot with a tem
pest inside. Men of high authority say there is no
good cause for the shrinking of stock values, but'
none the less they continue to shrink, and within
eleven days six big Wall-street firms have gone
to smash and others are shaky. '

What a -wonderfully rich field the officers of the
Federal Government have opened to themselves in
their decision to cut down useless expenses of gov
ernmental operations in the Philippines. If the plan
to prune expenditures be carried out honestly and
thoroughly the cost of owning our insular posses
sions will be so small that we may learn even to for
get that we have them at all on the revised map of
the United States. ' -
JUST before Regalado, the revolutionary usurper
of the Presidency of Salvador, left the office
which he reached by murder and administered as
a means of robbery he got drunk in the streets of the
capital, rode through the market, dispersing the peo
ple by shots from his revolver, and finally rode into
the leading store, kept by a Frenchman, jumped his
horse over the counters, destroyed a great deal of
property, and finally fell from the saddle and lay on
the floor in a drunken sleep for hours, while the
"state carriage" waited for him outsider-
Castro, the Monkey of the Andes, revolutionary
usurper of the Presidency of Venezuela, is open and
public in his debauchery and indecency. He claims
an annual tribute of maidens who strike his fancy,
and is monkey and Minotaur in one. Simon Sam,
President of Hayti, was another of these vulgar
voluptuaries with whom the nations of the world had
to maintain diplomatic relations. One marked fea
ture in these cases of public indecency by the heads
of Latin-American states is the silence of the people
and the press. Lese majeste is nowhere more tyranni
cally enforced than in those miscalled republics, which
are realty the meanest and most pestiferous autoc
racies that ever existed, with power founded on revo
lution, official fortunes founded on v stealing, and
diplomacy founded on lying.
Their Presidents, protected by our Monroe doc
trine, continually endanger the world's peace. If
that doctrine were not a principle of the United
States every one of the Latin-American nations would
by this time be annihilated by war brought upon
them by the thieves who rule them. The United
States would have the most of them, for we have suf
fered most from their international crimes. , True,
the Monroe doctrine does not restrain us from con
quest, but we have suffered robbery and insult, been
spat upon and had it rubbed in by the spiteful thieves
who rule those countries, and have not resented it
lest it be said that we hold to the Monroe doctrine
just to preserve the plum for ourselves. The time is
not distant when, without present conquest, we will
have to soundly whip several of those states to put
an end to organized theft and tyranny in this hemi
sphere.
The chaotic nature of their ideas about. government
and order was recently illustrated in Panama. Cobos,
the military commander of the state of Panama, got
drunk and put under military arrest all the civil
officers of the state he could catch while staggering,
and finally brqke into the Governor's house at mid
night to arrest him. The Governor escaped by
good running and hid in an American's house. Cobos
kept drunk all next day and declared the office of
Governor vacant and offered it to the American Con
sul! Finally his rampage ended by cutting off his
liquor; the Governor returned to his office, and, all
the press and people dared say about it was that "the
incident is closed."
Now this rampage was just like it would be for the
general commanding the Federal military department
of the Pacific to take a company of soldiers to Sac
ramento, put Secretary of State Curry in irons, seize
the treasury and chase Governor Pardee into hiding
in the house of British Consul Bennett! The consti
tutions of Colombia and the United States are simi
lar in their demarcation between civil and military
authority.. The outrage here would be no greater
than it was there. Yet who believes that it would oc
cur here and be spoken of as "an incident"?
Foreigners in most of those states have been and
at any moment are liable to be the victims of just
such drunken rampaping as that of Regalado, Castro,
Simon Sam and Cobos. . Indeed foreign Consuls
have been attacked, tied up and whipped on the bare
back by the savage and drunken brutes who parade as
presidents and comandantes in those states, and
when brought to account for such crimes the same
fellows have beaten their breasts and talked about
their "honor." It is time for the people of this coun
try to know what sort of formation we have to deal
with in most of Latin-America. -
RAMPAGING AT PANAMA.
?ion any importer should again bring the prohibited
articles to the United States he would deserve all
the loss that would fall , upon him. Furthermore, it
is to be noted that the Department of Agriculture
is not acting upon blind suspicions, nor has it asked
for a drag net investigation. It is proceeding upon
information derived from American Consuls in for
eign ports who have given notice of the shipment
of the forbidden goods. The law is a good one, and*
should have -public support, for it is designed to
serve the interests not only of consumers, but of the
producers of honest foodstuffs as well.;V ;

WILL, BE LAVISHLY ENTERTAINED DURING COMING SEASON.
The desperate man hunt, which has agitated Cali
*Â«r::ia for so many days and which has already cost
two honest lives, seems destined to end in some of
our big cities, where perhaps the escaped beasts of
Folsom may commit new crimes. Convicts seek the
city as rats swarm to the sewer*
The wise men ofBcrkeley have turned to be den
tists, and the subjects of their craft arc the majestic
oaks which adorn the college town. If, as some be
lieve, trees feel and think, it is to be hoped that the
trees of Berkeley won't suffer as the rest of us do
after the dentist Has stilled his hammer and we are
released from the' torture chamber.

Carnegie exhorted the trustees not to be
afraid of making mistakes, to try many
things freely, but to discuss just as free
ly, keeping in touch with the masses and
constantly aiming to improve their tastes
and to give Dunfermline something be
yond what was possessed by other cities.
Carnegie proceeded to say that he had
provided for thi3 experiment in his will
more than years ago, but his re
tirement from business enabled him to put
the scheme Into operation during his life
time. The problem set to the trustees
was, "What can be done in towns to
benefit the masses by money in the hands
of the most public-spirited citizens?"
If jt was proved that good could be
done the trustees would open new fields
to the rich, which, Carnegie said, he be
lieved they would hereafter be more and
more anxious to find for their surplus
wealth.
LONDON, Aug. 6.â In handing over to
fifteen representative citizens of his na
tive? town, Dunfermline, who were his
guests at Skibo Castle early this week, a
trust deed transferring to them J2.500.000
in 5 per cent bonds of the United States
Steel Corporation and PlttencrlefC Park,
Andrew Carnegie explained the objects he
had in view in these words: _
It Is an experiment the object of which is
to attempt to Introduce into the monotonous
lives of the tolling- masses of Dunfermllna
more of sweetness and light; to give them, es
pecially the young, some Improvement, some
elevating conditions of life which their resi
dence elsewhere would have denied, so that
a child in his native town will feel, however
far he may have roamed, that simply by vir
tue of being such, his life has been made hap
pier and better.

mitted a programme adopted by the en
tertainment committee of * the ladies,
which was approved by the general com
mittee, and it includes the following:
The Department of California, Ladies
of the Grand Army, will open headquar
ters at the- Palace Hotel on Monday, Aug

zation and veterans will find a cordial

Immediately on hearing that the fore
going communication had been made to

tee met at 3 o'clock and discussed the

H. Jordan and C. E. Wilson called on
John D. Soreckels and subsequently re
ported to the chairman. Another meet-
Ing of the executive committee will be
held at 10 a. m. to-day.
The contractors may be able to devise
some new method of supporting the sus
pended platform and canopy and proceed
with the work of constructing the arch.

DECORATIONâ ILLUMINATION.
The committee of the Grand Army de
sires to enlist the co-operation of the peo
ple of San Francisco in the matter of
giving the city a festive appearance dur
ing the week of the national encampment.
The funds thus far collected and what is
in sight are not sufficient to carry out
the plans of decoration and illumination
originally contemplated, and the work of
the committee in that respect will have
to be considerably curtaited. It Is there
fore most desirable, and the residents of
San Francisco are earnestly requested,
to decorate their premises with the na
tional colors and such other emblems as
they may desire for encampment week.
Especially are the proprietors of stores
and places of business appealed to, to
assist in illuminating the central and
business portion by a liberal use of in
candescents and other display. The com
mittee feels justified In calling attention
to the fact that the national encampment
of the Grand Army Is one of the most im
portant events in the history of this city,
and expects that the citizens will be equal
to the occasion.
The executive committee of the Grand
Army, at the meeting held last Wednes
day evening, decided to devote $500 from
its funds for the national encampment of
the Spanish-American War veterans and
for a reunion of all the veterans of that
war and the Philippine insurrection.
The Spanish-American War veterans
will hold a general meeting at Grand
Army headquarters this evening to per
fect plans for i the coming national en
campment.

The Board of Works will meet this

THE Board of Public Works re
ceived a communication yesterday
from W. J. Martin and Engineer
Wolters of the Claus Spreckels
building protesting against any
further hoisting on the* cable ropes sus
pended from the building for the purpose
of erecting the many sections of the G. A.
R. decorative arch. The communication
states that the undue strain which is
brought to bear" on the structural stone
work and on the cornice of the fifteenth
floor Is a very dangerous proposition and
liable to dislodge some of the stone or a
part of the cornice, the results of which
would cause these heavy stones to fall
to the sidewalk, a -distance of over 200
feet, thereby endangering the lives of
passing pedestrians. The letter concludes:
In view of these facts, wherein we feel to al
low this work to proceed any further would be
simply criminal on our part, we therefore here
by order your honorable body to have removed
from this building: at the earliest possible time
all the hoisting cable, apparatus, gear, etc.. ap
pertaining to this arch.

The passengers officials of the Southern
Pacific Company are being daily reminded
by the numerous telegrams received from
the East concerning the movement of
trains that the westward tide of travel
attendant upon the coming Grand Army
encampment here has already set In. As
yet the passenger department has not
been able to gain a correct Idea as to the
movement of the westbound trains, but in
the course of a day or bo It will be able
to know where every special train is lo
cated and will settle down to the task of
bringing their passengers into San Fran
cisco on their scheduled time. In plan
ning to bring the trains through on t'me
the officials of the Southern Pacific Com
pany have had to carefully consider the
welfare of the California fruit-growers,
who at this particular time of the
year are busily engaged In getting their
products to the Eastern markets, and not
a few of them have shown considerable
anxiety over the possibility of delay of
their cars while the old soldiers are mov
ing westward.
Passenger Traffic Manager E. O. Mc-
Cormick, however, In order to allay this
fear, has sent out letters assuring the
fruit men that the company has adopted a
plan which will guarantee their shipments
of fruit against delay. It is purposed to
have Immediate reports made of the ar
rival and departure of special trains at
Grand Junction, Ogden, Denver and Salt
Lake, ' so that their progress westward
may be anticipated and congestion of
trains prevented along the lines, as has
been an experience of the Southern Pa
cific Company on several occasions In the
past. Every piece of available rolling
stock is to be utilized In facilitating West
ern traffic and even a number of engines
at present engaged In the construction
work on the Salt Lake cut-off are to be
temporarily assigned to service on the
main road during the heaviest of the
travel this way. By avoiding a congestion
of trains and keeping the specials running
on a certain schedule the passenger de
partment of the Southern Pacific Com
pany is confident of giving the freight
trains a clear way and Insuring the safety
of California fruit destined for Eastern
markets.

As Jimmy Toman booted the ball and
Then made a few desperate stabs in his
endeavor to get it and wing it to the
plate yesterday at Recreation Park Mur
dock hit out over the rath that leads
to the rubber. Just a moment of anxiety
fnpued. Toman could not grab the ball,
Murdock ran still harder, then it was
over and the Oakland Cripples landed by
a score or 2 to 1 after thirteen innings of
strife with the Los Angreles team.
'Twas a royal battle from the first in
ning till Toman's disastrous mistake end
ed it all. The end could never be fore
seen, as each eide had chance upon chance
to score the telling tally.
The credit of the battle belongs solely
to Cooper and Joe Corbett. Each was
nt bis best and the way they pitched
hall was a revelation. It would be hard
indeed tr choose between the two, so good
was thrfir work. Each suffered from a
deal of hard luck, yet this did not seem
to dishearten them in the least. They
were always in the game and ready to
pitch the beet kind of ball* they knew.
The Angels got their only tally in the
fourth inninff. Smith drove a liner at
Cooper that was too torrid to handle.
Then Dillon bunted and Cooper fielded
the ball to the Moose, who dropped the
throw, and both runners were safe. Cra
vath also worked the bunt game and this
lime Cooper threw to third, but too late
lo hrad off Smith.
Ress hit a fly straight up In the air.
No one seemed to go after the ball, which
was descending near Baxter. Murdock
at last came runnins in from right field
and bare'.j- g-ot under the descending
sphere. He dropped It and Smith arrived
?t the ran with the run. In an instant
Murdock picked up the ball again and
threw Cravath out at second, thus sav
ine himself an error.
The Cripples created the long lasting
deadlock in their half of the seventh
ppasm. Baxter walked and promptly stole
second. Mo?kiman drove the ball over
Wheeler's head and the Moose sprinted
frr the- plate. Wheeler finally recovered
the baU and threw It home. It went wide
of Hi* plate and Baxter was safe.
Then began the fight in earnest. In the
ninth Wheeler made the mistake that lost
the tram., for the Angels. He was given
a chance on Cooper's error. Smith bunted
and Cooper sot wild again. He picked
up' tbÂ« ball and threw it away out to
the bleachers. Wheeler was tearing
Â« round the bags. When but a short dis
tance from the home plate he suddenly
Ftopped and started for third again. He
was thrown out on this sttipid play, when
he should have scored the winning run
for his team.

HORSE BREAKS NECK.
HARBIN SPRINGS, Aug. 6.â It will be
quite a feather In James J. Corbett's cap
if on the evening of the 14th inst. he can
score a knockdown on Jim JeffrieB, even
though defeat should ultimately be his
portion.
The giant boilermaker, whose massive
frame seems welded together with rivets
of steel, has never measured his length
on the padded floor, and only cracks a
emlle when it is intimated Corbett may
accomplish the trick. "Jeff" went down
the line again on Wednesday, his fore
noon work consisting of the usual gym
nasium exercises, then four rounds with
Bcb Fitzslmmons and three each with
Jack Jeffries and Joe Kennedy. Just after
luncheon he shot a turkey for a private
repast and filled in the afternoon with
playing whist. After the dinner hour the
big fellow captained a nine that defeated
a team with Joe (Kid) Egan as captain
by a score of 14 to 9. In comparison with
the slashing four rounds of last Monday
to-day's bout was only a puff of wind
alongside a Kansas cyclone. Early in
the - game Fit* j placed a picket fence
around his bread basket and didn't try to
test the force of any more blows with his
face than was necessary. During all his
training Jeff has claimed that he Is sail
ing along under closely reefed sails. That
being the situation, Corbett is apt to en
counter come squally weather. Jeffries
to-day did not spar with the same snap
and ginger as In Monday's work either,
but can be explained - from the fact ' that
Fltzsimmons was not inclined to hit it up.
At that, the pace cut out was- not mild
by any means. At the conclusion of the
ten rounds the champion was fresh as a
Powell street car conductor.
Unless all signs fall, Jeffries will not
leave here for Oakland until Wednesday
next, the day before the date set for the
big fight. This conclusion was arrived at
yesterday. The champion's last rough
work-out will take place on Saturday,
after which only light work necessary to
keep him nimble and active will be in
dulged In. Bob Fltzsimmons and wife
will leave here on Saturday evening. for
the city. Secretary Kid Egan will follow
the next day.
Dr. Clarence F. Tinman, the official
physician of the Yosemlte Club> gave the
champion a thorough examination and
was amazed at his muscular develop
ment. The physician pronounced all. of
Jeffries* organs normal and In â¢ perfect
condition, and pronounces him .one of the
grandest specimens of manhood 'Â¦ alhre,
with fountains of vitality apparently ex
haustless.
While many think Jim Jeffries a dia
mond'in the rough,. a warm heart beats
under the hardy exterior, and ' he is : con
tinually endeavoring to alleviate the con
dition of the'distressed or afflicted. To

ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS, N. J.. Aug.
Â«â¢â Twenty-one and a half minutes In a
twenty-mile race, which occupied a little
more than three hours in the sea, was the
beating administered to Shamrock I by
Sir Thomas Lipton's new cup candidate
to-day. No shift of wind nor calm helped
or hindered either boat. The challenger's
victory was without a flaw.
An overcast sky, with threat of rain. In
duced Fife to limit the course to twenty
miles, a beat of ten miles south-southeast
from Scotland lightship and return. To
avoid another blanketing by the chal
lenger Shamrock I feigned a start. Run
ning from 'windward to the starting line,
she shaped' a course alongside of the new
boat as the latter crossed the line. A min
ute later she put about, returning to the
line, and made a new start. The starting
time of two minutes had elapsed before
she got away, and she was handicapped
eight seconds. ; Shamrock HI led by one
minute and forty-two seconds when they
started the beat out to the mark. The
boats went off on different tacks, but
Shamrock III soon tacKett and both head
ed eastward. The challenger quickly
demonstrated that it was the kind of
weather in which she was at her best.
The old boat hardly gave her a race.
At 12:05. when they made' the first tack
together. Shamrock III had won the race.
After that the only question was as to
the number of minutes. At 12:35 the chal
lenger crossed the bow of the old-timer
half a mile to the windward of her, and
after short tacks turned the mark half an
hour later, with a lead of nineteen min
utes and forty-five seconds. On the way
back both yachts carried spinnakers part
way: when the wind, was hauling they
smothered them and ran under balloon Jib
topsails. Shamrock III gained steadily,
adding four minutes and twenty seconds
to her advantage, and when she finished
the old boat was more than two miles
away.

OLD SHAMROCK
IS OUTCLASSED
given at the music hall for the benefit of
George Nutter, an old pioneer of this sec
tion of the country and an employe at the
springs. Nearly a year ago Nutter had
the misfortune to break one of his ankles,
and is in need of medical attention. Jef
fries has always been averse to permit
ting strangers in or about his training
quarters. As many were anxious to see
him spar he conceived the idea of the
benefit. Besides the champion's regular
routine work with his sparring partners,
Mrs. Fitzslmmons and the pick of the tal
ent here at the springs will contribute.
Bob Fltzsimmons, another willing work
er In a just cause, journeyed down to
Mlddletown this^ afternoon and in the

BERKELET, Aug. (.â Professor John C.
JlprrJam of the geological department of
<he State University returned this morn
ing from & month's trip among the Shasta
County caves. During the greater part of
the time Professor Merriam was with
Field Assistant Eustice C. Furlong ex
p'.orlng and excavating among a half
dozen new caves which Furlong had dis
covered. Two of these proved very rich
in palaentolog-ical remains, yielding up
the bones of animals now extinct and of
s species hitherto unknown to scientists.
Pome evidences tending to Ehow human
habitation of thrne caves were found, but
until a more thorough investigation has
rx-^n made it will be impossible to decide
definitely upon this point. Broken, round
rd and splintered bones were found.
Whether these represent the attempt of
an aboriginal people to provide themselves
with Implements or are simply manifesta
tions of animal life is a matter of ques-
Tion. The bones will be shipped to Berke-
>y during the coming week and further
light will be thrown upon the matter
there.
Aming the remains of animals fouqd in
these two caves were those of the bison,
the mountain lion, the cave bear and the
pround tloth. In the opinion of Professor
Marian these represent a period later
than the animals of the Potter Creek
cave. One evidence of this is the fact
That the caves are much nearer to the
Kodoad River than was the Potter Creek
care. "The relative age of the fauna, says
rrof^sor Merriam, is proportional to the
Besnten of the strata in which the re
mains are found to the river.
In on* of these caves an old tradition
!Â¦--. <\ it that a woman wandering about
rtumbled into a well, the bottom of
Â»h!ch Â°rould never be reached. Professor
M'rriam and Mr. Furlong discovered in
"r.e of them a 6haft leading down about
100 ft-et. At the bottom they found the
Fkeleton of a woman, fairly well pre
served, whom they judged to have fallen
or t.een thrown into the well about 100
years ago.
The Pottpr Crwk cave is now nearly"Â«x
hausted. Field Assistant Sinclair Is ex
torted to complete the work in the late
fall.
The cave bear, a species first discovered
la the Potter Creek cave, has been named
Lbe Eustiee Furlong bear in honor of the
young explorer who first discovered the
rave.

The first cablegram came to Attorney
W. S. Goodfellow of San Francisco, who
holds power of attorney for Lloyd, and
who Is his personal representative Noth
ing is said as to whether the body will be
brought back, but It is expected to come
by the Korea, now due to sail from China
SAX BERNARDINO. Aug. 6.â A cable
gram was received here to-day announc
ing the sudden death at Yokohama, Ja
pan, of Charles R. Lloyd, the Berkeley
capitalist who was shot In this city by
his nephew, William Boxail, on January
31 last. Lloyd wds a passenger from San
Francisco on the steamer Korea, which
sailed the latter part of June. .He Intend
ed to make the round trip with Captain
Seabury, a personal friend, and was ac
companied by Mrs. Lloyd. The trip was
taken at the direction of his physicians,
who hoped ti.at the voyage might help
his weak ! heart, which never recovered
from the effects of the shooting.
The causes behind the attempt to mur
der Lloyd have never been made public^
but personal and family matters entered
into the complications, in which his son,
Fred Lloyd, his nephew, William Boxail,
and nieces were all participants. On one
side there was the charge of conspiracy
to blackmail the capitalist, while on the
other the claim that he had mistreated
his niece, sister of the nephew who did
the shooting. The niece subsequently
swore to a complaint making charges
against Lloyd, and though the warrant
was never served personally, friends at
once appeared and offered bail In $10,000,
which was accepted.
The day of the shooting. William Box
all went to Lloyd's residence In this city
and after a conference between the two,
which was also attended by Miss Wilk
inson, Lloyd's housekeeper, Lloyd started
to leave the house. Boxail followed him
into the. street and fired three shots, all
of which took effect. One grazed the
backbone, and at first it was thought he
could not recover. After life hanging in
the balance for weeks, he Improved
enough to be taken to his Berkeley home,
but could not appear at the preliminary
examination of Boxail. which has not yet
been held. Fred Lloyd, the son, who was
arrested for alleged complicity in the
case, has never been examined in court.
He and William Boxail are supposed to
be at Santa Monica at present. Boxail is
out on 110,000 ball, charged with assault to
commit murder. It Is stated here that a.
new complaint will be Issued at once,
charging murder.
Besides a widow and the son, Fred
Lloyd, he left another son who Is -a-Lleu
tenant in the army, stationed at a post
in the East. Local representatives of
Lloyd know of property that will foot up
about $700,000, and they believe the estate
will go close to a million.
â¢ Debray is 19 years of age. He was em
ployed through an agency In San J Fran
cisco three months ago. The prisoner
talked- volubly -about everything but the
crime of, which. he is accused.
Mintzer. Â«aid: "As a result of the ex
posure to our absolute satisfaction of De
bray's .guilt I 'am thoroughly convinced
Debray told his Wednesday
that he would like to go to San Fran
cisco the t following day. on business. Â¦â Only
too willing to accommodate. the suspected
servant,/ Mlntzer had him . driven yester
day morninsr; to San Pablo. There Con
stable Bouquet and Sheriff Veale awaited
Debray -and i took him Into custody. He
was sent to Martinez.
It wÂ»s a lonely vigil in the dark and
foggy night. There was nothing stirring
until three hours later, when the watch
man espied the shadowy form of a man
flitting through the fog. But the In
truder did not go near the hidden bag. so
nothing could be done that night.
The next day Mintzer took Constable
Bouquet into conference. They devised a
second plan. A letter was written .to
Debray and mailed In San Francisco, of
fering him a position at wages $10 a
month more than he was being paid by
Mlntzer. In due time the butler. replied
In a note, written in French, and saying
he would call and probably accept the
supposed new olace.
That letter, of course, fell Into the
hands' of , the* officers. Comparisons â¢ of
handwriting were made with the extort
ing " letter > Mlntzer found. It was settled
that the butler ,was the ; author of both
of them.! '"Â¦" , ; V . ' â¢ : ..
NO SEARCHER COMES.
Following the directions in the letter,
Mlntzer prepared apparently to comply
with the demand for coin and at the same
time entrap the blackmailer. He filled a bag
with small stones, that it should simulate
a sack of coin, and himself placed it at
the appointed spot in -the garden ,on
Tuesday evening following the receipt of
the note, per instructions. That night at
11 o'clock he fired the shot and the guard
Mintzer had on duty near the cache
waited for developments.
On the same sheet was a rough diagram
showing in which corner of the garden
the money should be secreted that was to
save the lives of the Mintzer family.
After reading the portentous message
Mlntzer lost no time In forming a plan
of action. He decided that he had to
deal with either a crazy man or a des
perate enemy.
The message, a blood-curdling one,
breathing death and disaster, explained
the caiise of the shot. The writer said he
had fired to attract Mintzer's attention:
that to save his family Mlntzer must sur
render toOOO. The threatening screed was
Illy composed, showing the writer to have
been a foreigner and little acquainted
with English. It runs as follows:
Sir: Excuse my language if you please, be
cayie 1 am not American. I cm Italian and
no speak English too' much. I no want to
kill you to-night. I want i prove - 1 can kill
you. I am paid for kill all your family, but
if you want give me $3000 I no kill you and
I tell- the name of your enemy. If you ac
cept give mti signal. Fire a gun at 11-o'clocit
to-morrow evening and put your money in
the corner of the fence of your garden. If
you no want paid me I kill your children,
your wife and yourself. Suppose I am appre
hend by you or a policeman, my friend avenge
me after and I no tell his name.

Debray was arrested yesterday morning
at San Pablo by Sheriff Veale of Contra

The Mintzer residence is in the foot

The attention of the head of the house

by the sound of a pistol shot In the gar

The Times this morning prints a dis
patch from Kleff, Russia, dated August
1. which says that General Arzenieff. Gov
ernor of the district of Odessa, and the
Mayor of Odessa, together with a com
mittee of influential citizens, have in
duced the tramway strikers to resume,
on the distinct understanding that their
grievances will be considered and conces
sions granted. General Arzenieff received
instructions July 30 from St. Petersburg
enjoining -him to refrain from active In
terference with the men provided they
maintained order and obeyed the police.
In the event the mob became recalcitrant
he was directed to have the troops fire
blank cartridges, and then, if necessary,
three rounds of bullet cartridges.
The correspondent gives details of the
riots similar to those contained in the
accounts of the Daily Mall's correspond
ent. He says the strikers made no seri
ous attempt to resist the police, and that
General Arzenleff's actions are freely
condemned as unwarrantedly precipitate.
He says:
There have been a few fatalities, but
no serious disorders. It is stated that
while the strikers were trying to prevent
a train starting Saturday night four of
the strike leaders were run over and
killed. .
The strikers did not get all they de
manded, but In most cases were met with
fair spirited compromises on the part of
the employers. According to the corre
spondent, the local Odessa papers on the
day the dispatch was sent announced
that the Governor had issued a statement
to the effect that he had summarily con
victed seventy-one persons and had sen
tenced them to three months' imprison
ment for disturbing the public order. The
names given include many Jews and a few
foreigners.
The strike ended just in time to avert
serious food riots, as the high price of
provisions led to ominous popular threats
to storm the bakeries and flour mills.
The Standard's Odessa correspondent,
under date of. August 2, says that all the
trades have now resumed work and that
the strike is practically ended, but that
the city will remain under martial law
for at least another ten days.
FOOD RIOTS AVERTED.
The. epidemic of Incendlarlirn is spreading
through KumU. Scarcely a day passes with

which hac to^tn employing men for years has
paid sailors at the rate of only 25 shillings a

KIEFF. Russia, Aug. 6.-The strike in
the railway and private workshops con
tinues. An attempt by the strikers to in
terfere with railroad traffic led to a se
rious riot. The strikers refusing to dis
perse, they were fired upon by Cossacks,
who subsequently charged, killing and
wounding many.
At Batoum all the strikers have re
sumed work and the town is tranquil.
LONDON. Aug. ".âThe Daily Mall's
Nikaeloeff correspondent, under ' date of
August 2, fully confirms the Times cor
respondent's accounts of strikes in South
Russia! , The correspondent says that
a quarter of a million men are affected
and that simultaneously strikes occurred
over a vast Industrial area. He says that
the amount of studied 'organization and
well concealed preparation were unpre
cedented in the troubled annals of Rus
sian labor. Prices of the necessaries of
life are rising by leaps and bounds.
. The strikers, on the whole, have pre
served exemplary order, but this has not
saved them from ravage attacks directed
by General Arzeniefr, Governor of Odessa.
Groups of men who assembled last Sat
urday with the Intention of holding a
meeting were driven into a solid mass

of infantry with fixed bayonets. About
2000 strikers being thus Inclosed by. _a dou

ADMINISTRATIVE SAVAGERY.
The correspondent continues: -
When the living mass had bÂ«Â«en thoroughly
kneaded to the Governor's -will numerous m*n
were arrested as sucpected airitators. ThÂ« In
fantry then marched off and the etrik-rs scat
tered In a dozen directions, with Cossack* at
their heel*. It Is rumorPd that 400 ittrlkers
were more or lers seriously injured and that
from six to a dozen pureumhed. â¢ Th<Â» whole
affair Is a typical piece of administrative snv
Â»S*ry. The extraordinary feature of the move
ment \t Odessa is that the pollco and gen
darmes belonging to onÂ» depot threatened to
throw .off their uniforms and risk all the tÂ»r
rors of Insubordination unless the miserable
pittance of 11 to 14 "pence which they are
allowed daily was Increased and the hours of
labor reduced. Siberia Is losing Its terrors
eve-n for Kuasian policemen.

The Union Labor Central Club, other
wise known as 'the opposing faction to
the Mayor Schmitz party, held a meeting
last evening at 102 O'Farrell street. James
A. Brien acted as chairman and J. Mc-
Namee as secretary. The meeting passed
off without any differences, most of the
time being, spent In arranging for the
mass meeting of delegates, which will
take placÂ«Â» 'to-morrow evening at the Al

labor party will be addressed by Con
gressmpn-elect Wynn and Llvernash.
The following delegate ticket selected
by the executive committee of the United
Republican League Club of the Twenty
ninth District was ratified at a big meet
ing held last evening:
Registrar Walsh has given notice that
he will . insist on strict compliance with
the law prohibiting any Identification
marks on tickets for the primary elec
tion. It if? observed that some printers
are putting the uriTon label on tickets,
ami this or any other mark is illegal.
There are no' indications at this time
of a very large vote at the primary elec
tion next Tuesday, but the interest in
the approaching contest is increasing.
Ratification meetings to-morrow evening
and Monday, night will, probably, bring
out many voters. Â¦; The Democrats and
Union Labor men have sufficient contro
versy In their own camps to pjevent them
from Identifying themselves with the Re
publican contest. The hot light in the
Labor party will come on the proposition
to fuse with the Democrats. The fol
lowers of Mayor Schmitz have nominated
delegates In every Assembly district and
promise to give Casey's men a hard battle
at the polls.
The Independent Republican Club of the
Thirtieth Assembly District has selected
the following as delegates to be voted for
next Tuesday: Patrick M. O'Connor, Ar
thur H. Cousins. James Wilkinson. Dan

Captain Snow Fays Miller's rights will
l>e protected, as the navy makes no dis
tinction as to color.
NEW YORK. Aug. 6.-The color line
has been drawn on board the': United
States receiving ship Columbia, at the
Brooklyn navy yard. The chief petty of
ficers have refused to mess with a negro
who has just been sworn in as chief car
penter's mate. This evening they assert
ed their unwillingness to associate with
him in any way or to receive or Qarry out
any orders that may come to them
through him in the line of duty.
Isaac Miller, the chief carpenter's mate,
is not a full-blooded negro. He has been
in the navy many years and has a good
record. For a long time prior to his re
cent promotion, which was for merit, he
ranked as carpenter's mate of the first
class. When Miller appeared at the chief
petty officers' mess on Wednesday eight
other members of the mess arose and left
the table. Miller ate his dinner as if noth
ing out of the ordinary had occurred.
Since then he has had no company at his
meals. He has been allowed, when he
reached the table first, to eat alone, and
when others preceded him he has waited
until they finished.
The fire amounted to nothing and* was
put out In a few minutes. It started in
the kitchen of the home and was caused
by a defective flue. The fire was dis
covered by one of the nurses, who turned
in the alarm. The damage amounts to
very little.
Several policemen soon arrived on the
scene, and they at once restored order,
though it was not an easy matter by any
means, as the old ladies were badly
frightened and Insisted on getting out of
the building. That many were not In
jured Is fortunate, as all of them lost
their heads during thÂ© excitement and
forgot all else save the thought of escap
ing.
A disastrous conflagration was narrow
ly averted at an early hour this morning,
when a defective flue in the Old. Ladles'
Home In the rear of St. Mary's Hospital
caught fire. Fortunately the flames were
discovered in time and an alarm was sent
in from box 56. which brought the engines
to the scene and the slight blaze was ex
tinguished before any headway was
gained.
The home la a large â¢ wooden structure,
situated directly in the rear of St. Mary's
Hospital. It is occupied by more than 100
aged women and when the alarm was
given that the place was in danger of be
ing destroyed there was a mad rush of
the occupants from the building.
There was no one present to calm the
old ladles and they started to rush from
the building. They appeared at the win
dows and many shouted for help. The
stairways were crowded and the passage
ways blocked, so that for a time it looked
as though a disastrous panic would re
sult.
CHARLES LLOYD
DIES IN JAPAN
A foreign liner brought in to-day the
last word of the attacking squadron, the
entire fleet being sighted several hundred
miles off shore on the evening of August'
4. At that time the fleet was steaming in
an easterly direction.
PORTLAND, Me., Aug. 6.-With thick
and stormy weather along the coast it
would seem as if the attacking fleet under
Rear Admiral Sands had the "best possi
ble conditions to-day in which to win the
war game by evading the defending
squadron under Rear Admiral Barker
and establishing itself in some one of the
numerous little harbors of the Eastern
Maine coast. But at a late hour to-night
nothing had been heard from the "ene
my." while reports from the defending
squadron during the day were somewhat
meager. Several of the swift torpedo
beat destroyers ran into Penobscot dur
ing the day and a naval tug came into
Bar Harbor for mail.
The main portion of Admiral Barker's
fleet, however, kept well off shore, and
it is believed continued the work of pa
trolling the coast between Eastport and
Cape Ann.
Admiral Sands has still about three
days in which to make his dash for the
coast, and it i3 believed that he will wait
until the last moment In order to give
the defending squadron plenty of prac
tice in patrolling and take advantage of
any relaxation in the vigilance of their
work.

have beea created, or the emolument* of which
r-Â»v* been ircrejused. during ruch term, except
nJT* offices as may be tiUed by election by the
l^opie.
la answer to a communication received
frcm Governor Pardee. requesting knowl
tdgc as to whether a member of the last
Legislature !s new eligible to appointment
to the oCJce of Code Comnaissiorser, as
provided for and approved by the Legis
lature on March 25, 1M3, Attorney General
Webb responded yesterday, stating that
it itss his opinjon that a member of the
last Legislature â¢was eligible to appoint
ment to the cfilce of Cede Commissioner.
The Attorney General, in giving his
cr-ialcn. explains In his communication to
ihe'Governor inat the. original office ol
Cede Conunlasioner was created by pro
vision cf section 1 cl the act of the Leg
islature in 15S5. but limiting the time of
the oÂ£Sce, and that under an art approved
i.t the n;e*Â»tir;g cf the Legislature held
March 23, 13C2, there appears nothing in
the title or in the body of the later act to
indicate that the legislature intended to
dbolifh the office created by the act of
3*15. The later act is purely and profess
s^dly an amendment of the earlier one,
inasmuch us the provisions of the earlier
act incorporated in the later act are con
tinued. All of the portions of the act of
I&O.m-bich are copied in the act of 1?"J3
are not to be considered &s having been
repealed and enacted again, but are to
be considered as having been the law
from the datt* of thÂ«* adoption of the first
art up to the present time.
For thc^e reasons the Attorney General
hnl^s that a member of Ibe Legislature
â¢would not come under the provisions of
rrction IS of article IV of the constitu
tion of this State, which is as follows:
PORTLAND. Or.. Aug. 6.â After being
more than a year with a cargo of general
merchandise from Antwerp, the French
bark Grande Duchesse Olga arrived in the
Columbia River to-day. Her voyage is
one of the longest on record, and but for
the fact that she had been spoken every
now and then her name would probably
have long ago been placed among the lost.
The Duchesse left Antwerp for Portland
with a cargo consigned to CJirvin & Eyre
early In the year 1802. She had a rough
passage down the channel, but met still
uglier weather In the South Atlantic, and
off the coast of South America was
caught In a blow that threatened to send
her to the bottom. Under bare poles,
however, she succeeded In reaching Rio
de Janeiro. Several months were lost in
the Brazilian port.
Believes Act of 1903 Was
Net Intended to Inter
d'e" Them.
Nearly Goes to the Bottom
Off the Coast of South
America.

The movement In call money did not affect

NEW YORK, Aug. 6.â Wall street emerged
to-day from Its gloom, which still clouded the
situation during the early hours of the trading
in stocks, and an effective rally in prices wac
produced. The day closed with an animated
buying movement in progress and with tho
prices on the active list from 1 to over 3
points above last night. During the period of
early weakness there were numerous declines
of from 1 to 2 piints. breaking through pre
vious low levels of the year. The early wtak
ness was not universal, many stocks showing
good resistance and reflecting determined sup
port by means of confident twijrins; on tne part
Of the market manitcers for stocks. Ther*
Â»a* acute ueaknÂ»*s tfter the opening, which
â¢Â¦enfrd upen Missouri Pacific. Atchison. Balti
more arid Ohio. This seemed -to be a contin
uation of yesterday's liquidation and the elop
ing out of '.ollateral in loans. The weak spots
In the market, of which the above etockx were
the rnoei notable, kept the tone unsettled and
r.ervou*. The eagernfja shown for the an
nouncement, which was made in a conspicuous
manner, that all *heets had safely passed the
St-jrk Exchange Oaring-house and the evident
relief after the announcement, showed clearly
that fears had bÂ«ien felt that further failures
would reÂ»ult from the. Mrained condition of af
f a ir*-. After the Oeartng-house sheets had
gone through there was a relaxation in the
wiling pressure and indications that liquida
tion of a more urgent character had spent its
courw. The stability of parts of the market
which were supported by large banking inter
ests arrceted the rapid Fhrinkage In collat
eral which arou*ed *uch acute uneasiness yes
terday. The market gradually strengthened
during the latter part of the day and became
quite buoyant at the last, lt may be accepted
as a matter of course that covering of short
contracts by provisional traders played an
important i>art Jn the recovery, as this class
of operators would not desist from putting out
short sales ss long as the decline in prices
continued. Thf mere fact of the turn in the
tide of the market also gave rise to a flood of
rumors intended to explain the change in sen
timent. The favorite rumor was that a coali
tion has been formed among the most powerful
capitalists in the country to buy all stocks
that were offered and to lend freely to the
distressed interests in the market. This rumor
presented so pleasing a prospect that every
body who gave credence to lt was disposed to
buy stocks to the extent of his ability. The
professional trader* short of the market were
of course foremost In this eagerness. As a
mstter of fact there Is reason to believe that
an exchange of views on the situation among
important capitalists has- disclosed an agree
ment of opinion as to the advisability of avoid
ing the further selling out of collateral as far
as possible. But the lenders In the stock mar
ket show considerable variation in the policy
pursued in this matter, as was disclosed by
further dosing out of collateral this morning
There wa* as little in the news of the day to
account for the rally as there has been for the
recent heavy decline. Liquidation in grain
and cotton was supposed to h* induced to nome
extent by the threatening situation In Wall
street and the rise In the call loan rate to 4
per cent this afternoon was said to be due In
part to the cancellation of some loans In cot
ton. '

"Hereafter the tendency of prices ought to
bÂ»> conservatively upward for really pood stocks.
More reactions are to be exj-ected because of
further liquidation on the part of concern*
that were recently tided over. But sales of
this chararw-r car.nrt be very large after such
a thorough house-cleaning a* we have Just
parsed through. Stocks have been drifting
into ftronger hande, and no doubt tome of the
big railroad deal* which have been pending
for a year or two will be facilitated by the
recent shifting of owner*h!i> and removal of
antagonistic influence*. How much the late
depression ha* been aprravated by operations
of this sort fcy some of the biggest leaders will
never be disclosed, but the skill and fore* with
which the downward movement was conducted
â alway* eSfÂ«-ctua!!y checked when panic threat
ened â t-tronKiy suggests that powerful interests
have- shrewdly taken artvcr.tage of recent ccn
ditior.s to further important plan*. Good
railroad securities purchased with discrimina
tion on the declines will therefore eventually
prove rrcfitable investments."
"The most satisfactory feature of the last
few .Â«.; ;Â¦ has been the easier rates for time
money. Tfcls demonstrate* reviving coafl
dence on the rart of bankers who are obliged
to anticipate the future. While the high fig
ure at which loans continue to star.d la the
weekly bank statement is a matter of concern
10 -:â¢.,. observers who have been anticipating
a eha.ro contraction as the reÂ«ait vl recent
liquidation, bankers <lo not fhow any anxiety
In this resjiect. probably because they non
have their resources unusually well in hand
ar.d profitably employed. There are three far
tors accountir^ ier this high level of loans,
which are sometimes overlooked. , vi *-< l^ e
la.rge increase of b&nkir.g capital in New York,
the larÂ»:e amount of railroad yaper cu'Jtax.J
ln* and the increesed extent to which tig in
dustrial establishments under the trust system
row borrow in New York inktead of near tne
mills es formerly. Stock market liquidation
must aJso have etrengtatntd the bar.iti much
more than ha* yet sj-p^ered m the wÂ«*kly
statements. Besides; these factors gold 1* now
on the way here frcm Au*tr*!ia, and ia the
present confilti-w or the European money mar
ket* ar.v emergency here Â»ou!d quickly start
gold Imports to thif center. The local money
market, therefore, Ss in much improved condi
tion. Very Â«oon cre;i <!en-.ar.<is will assert
themselves ; but the bank* ere well rr p r*'<?d
for thÂ«e. Kr.d tte present outlook is that no
rpeclfl inccn\ enier.ee will be caused thereby.
It is quite certain that lÂ«Â«itimate trade will
not ruffer for want of proper financial accom
modation this summer or fall: and ei*<rulatlve
d*rnar.O are not likely to be excessive for
Â¦orne time to corse.
â¢"Now that liquidation has about run its
course it Is proper to consider future influences,
such i.e crops, penerai business, railroad earn
ings, currency Irg'.slation and political can-
I>a!gi:*. As to erepa, the oÂ»Jtlrx-k le still for

ton, oats, hay ar.d live stock. There will be
plenty cf wheat at t-ood prices to the iarrr.er.
Cora promises a :!.0>.>0,00(.t.UW crop. Cottcn is
liktiy to jleld a normal crop and is rare of
big pric*s to the grower, which means unurual
prosperity In the South l"c>r the next twelve
month*. Th!s i* one of the rc.nrt *triking prob
abllitlee of to-day. Live *tock raisers are
Â«!jo anticipating a profitable season. General
business has not Una far been disturbed by
the Wall street crash. Possibly new enter
prise* will recÂ«i%-e eome check in consequence:
tut all advice* from the interior agree in re-
, iJ>r:'.r.g saiisfactcry conditions tnd fair pros
pect* for ar.cthe-r good *Â«>Â«*on with distributer*.
Railroad earnings continue lÂ«.rpe and in the

CHICAGO. Aug. 6. â Wheat ruled rather quiet
throughout the day. Opening prices were weak
on lower cables and more favorable weather
In the Northwest, September being a shade to
%@%c lower at 79Â©79%c. The market con
tinued weak the first half of the session on an
entire absence of news which could be con
strued as favorable to the bulls, but toward
the noon hour there was fair buying by spec
ulators and the price again .recovered. One
of the main causes for the advance was the
good export demand at- the seaboard. Offer
ings were limited the latter ' part of the day
and this fact contributed to the. late strength.
Under these ' influences September sold up to
80% c and closed at SOViÂ©SO%c. a net gain of
%Â©%c. ' - Â¦ ? '
Trading in . corn was comparatively slow
owlrg to a lack of selling pressure. The late
strength in wheat helped corn- prices and the
close was steady with September unchanged
at 62%c.
Oats sympathized somewhat with the early
weakness in wheat, but -offerings were rather
light and prices recovered without much effortl
The close was firm with September %c higher
at 34UC.
Provisions ruled weak, with considerable
selling by brokers, supposed to be acting for
local packers. September pork closed 17%c
lower, lard was off 2%c and ribs down 10

Frank White, alias Tony Bonetto, was
held, to answer before the Superior Court
by Police Judge Conlan. yesterday on a
charge of burglary, in J2000 bonds. He
was accused of having entered a vacant
house at 70S Webster street, on July 24,
and stealing a quantity of lead pipe,
which he had in a sack when arrested by
Policeman Earle. The Judge had agreed
to reduce the 'charge to petty larceny,
owing to the defendant's youth, if he
would plead, guilty, but when the case
was called yesterday the defendant's at
torney entered a plea of not guilty and
demanded a trial by jury- The Judge at
once held the defendant on the burglary
charge.
Held on Burglary Charge.
Attorney General U. S. Webb has
granted to E. P. Davis of Bakersfleld
leave to maintain an action in the name
of the People against Bert M. Tlbbet, to
determine Tibbefs right to the office
of City Marshal of Bakersfield.
The relator, Davis, and one T. J. Pack
ard were candidates for the office at the
election held April 13, 1903, and the City
Board of Trustees, upon canvassing the
returns, declared Packard elected.
Packard died on April 21 and the Board
of Trustees appointed Tibbet, who has
since discharged the duties of the office.
Davis, however, Â¦ contends that- Packard
was not, in fact, elected, and the Attor
ney General has. authorized an action in
quo warranto to determine the matter.

vices wero received by the steamer
Aorangl that there is a strong adverse

the project would be abandoned.
Sir Henry More Jackson, High Commis
sioner of Britain, was refused landing at
Tonga on arrival there in H. 1 M. 3. Plei
ades. The warship had gone to Tonga
from Fiji, nnd measles being epidemic the
local authorities refused the Commis
sioner , a landing. The British Consul

land. For this an apology was given by
the King.

Twenty-five witnesses from Captain
Ewen's own county and other witnesses
from Powell County, where he resided
until he moved to Jackson some ten
years ago, testified that Ewen's morality
was bad, as was also his reputation for
truthfulness. At the same time some of
them testified that he was a churchgoer,
was a constant attendant at Sunday
school and never drank whisky or gam
bled. Many of them were confused on
cross-examination, especially those from
Breathitt County. The best impeaching
evidence was offered by a number of cit
izens of Powell County, including the
County Judge, the Sheriff and others, who
testified that Ewen had a Dad reputation
as to morality and truthfulness among
his neighbors, although each of these wit
nesses, as far as his personal opinion was
concerned, testified without exception
that Ewen paid his debta promptly and
never drank, and attended church regu
larly while residing among them.
"Tick" Beech, who testified several days
ago for the defense, was contradicted by
Witness Russell for the prosecution and
also by Cyrus Holland. Beech swore sev
eral days ago he had seen the killing, and
these witnesses say that he had told them
that he did not see the killing and that
he was glad he did not see it. The Com
monwealth will swear out a warrant for;
the arrest of Beech and John L. Noble,
who will be charged with having sworn
falsely.

The first arrests under a new ordinance
that came Into effect on July 27 last were
made by Corporal Sylvester and squad In
Chinatown yesterday afternoon. The or
dinance makes it a misdemeanor for any
one "to ejchlblt or exposÂ© to view in any
barred or barricaded house or room, or
in any place built or protected in a man
ner to make it difficult of access or in
gress to police officers, when three or
more persons are present, any cards, dice,
dominoes, fantan table or layout, or part
of such layout, or any gambling imple
ments whatsoever."
Corporal Sylvester believed that fantan
was being played at 115 "W&verly place
and he went there yesterday afternoon
with his squad, but found the outer door
locked. He started to force an entrance,
when the door was opened, but sufficient
time had elapsed for a fantan layout to
be removed. Five Chinese were found
playing dominoes and they were arrested
and taken to the City Prison for violating
the ordinance. Set of dominoes and dice
were seized as evidence.,. - . . . ; â¢/.

Â¦ custom which exists in almost every civilized and many semi-civilized Â®
g| . ' countries. o
O In the agricultural districts of Poland, where horses are most neces- q
% eary to cover long distances over the broad steppes, it is most natural . 3
? that the wedding procession should take the form of a "promenade en gj
i D voiture." It is such a scene, full of life and gayety, that is depicted in

At the hands of Shortrldge Mehan
fared badly. The attorney for the pris
oner at the bar tried, to make Mehan
acknowledge that.he doubted the genuine
character of any of Lynch's signatures
and. had . reduced the Chinese inspector
to almost temporary prostration < before
Judge'de, Haven interfered. ' ":.. : . . Â¦*.
MEHAN IS FLUSTERED.
Wright said that when Lynch received
the note from the District Attorney of El
Paso,. Texas, inquiring for file 6S701. con
taining the originals' of' certificates
thought to be fraudulent, he searched in
the file room, and after a three days* in
termittent effort discovered the book on
a lower shelf, hidden behind a box of
envelopes, so as to be effectually con
cealed from any casual scrutiny.
Upon cross-examination Attorney Short
ridse, in attempting to prove that many
people were in the habit of frequenting
the file room, made Wright admit -that,
together with the young women in the of
fice, he had sometimes discussed a, lus
cious â¢ watermelon below the| volumes of
Chinese certificates, and that on one oc
casion he had even gone in there with
Dillard to take a look at a flat bottle.
Charles Mehan. head of the Chinese
Bureau in this city, then related how he
had first discovered the existence of the
fraudulent certificates at Deming, N. M.
He said that he had doubted the authen
ticity of the reply purporting to have
come- from Collector Lynch In response to
a demand foe file No. 6S701 of the original
certificates and had put the alleged for
gery into the hands of the local -District
Attorney at Demine. . ., . -
George A. Wright, chief deputy clerk in

his intimate knowledge' of Dillard's ac

that Dillard took sole charge of the busi

box and opened all the ordinary business

man, by which he had been smuggled int
the country' on a fraudulent certificate.
The trembling . witness then, said that
he paid 3100, into the hands of the white
man, whose name he did not remember
because American names were : not easy
ones. He said that the $100 was, also for
the- far away "black man." 'Like his pre
decessor, he failed to see. any similarity
between the portrait of himself and that
appearing on the original paper . in the
files of* the Collector of Revenues. He
taid that the white agent who . acted as
middleman to. get him across : the border
had metThim through. a. letter. from Toy

CHINESE BEVEAL ! PLOT.
the Northern District of Califor

Sing, erstwhile merchant of- Chinatown
and alleged accomplice of William' II. Dil
lard. the colored ex-clerk in the' office of
the United States Internal Revenue Col
lector, now standing trial for the forgery
of fraudulent Chinese certificates. Toy
Man Sing is lost to the grip of the law,
but hlsjllicit dealings with Dillard were
exposed before the bar of justice yester
day.
Three weazened-faced Chinese . testified
yesterday that they came across the
Mexican border on certificates furnished
them by this same Toy Man Sing"; who
had, in turn, procured the magic talis
mans from, some "black man", in San
Francisco. Revenue Agent Burt'Thomp
son told of the raid made upon the quar

Master Dennett Bell, a mite of a boy,
12 . years of age, arrived from Los An
geles yesterday, having completed half
of a Journey which will terminate when
ho returns to his home in Chicago. The
youngster is the son of Frank Er Bell,
city ticket agent of the Burlington road
in Chicago, and alone he is making a tour
of the coast, seeing and. enjoying all that
appeals to his youthful mind. He is a
remarkable young traveler ip that this
is not his first trip around the country.
M'hen only six years old he was dispatch
ed on a pleasure trip down the Missis
sippi River to the Mexican gulf and since
then has made another journey from Chi
cago south as far as Alabama, this time
accompanied by his little sister. His only
credentials are his passes, provided him
by the various railroads, and a few let
ters which his father has given his son
addressed to railroads agents in the vari
ous towns and -cities which are included
In the' itinerary of the traveler.
Young Bell is a pupil of the Chicago
schools and Is allowed to travel during
the vacation months. He started west
ward on his present, trip on July 22 and
went direct to Los Angeles, where he was
afforded every facility within the power
of the railroad officials there to visit the
different points of interest, -and finally
he proceeded on his journey to this city,
where he contemplated with pleasure a
chance to visit the Cliff House and hear
the seals bellow. Dennett Immediately
upon his arrival here yesterday paid his
respects to G. W. Hallock, city passenger
agent of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company, who is an old friend of the
boy's father and who at- once Invited the
little fellow to be his guest during his
stay in San Francisco. Discussing his
trip yesterday with a Call reporter, Den

Bitterly Complain of
Delay in Repaying
Third Street.
No Longer Manager of
House That Bears
His Name.
Dennis J. Grauman Is no longer connect
ed with the Pacific Coast Vaudeville Com
pany. Ho has resigned as, manager of the
circuit and also as manager of the theater
at Seventh and Market streets that bears
his name.
Grauman sold out his stock to the other
members of the company last Saturday,
and they allege that he has not given sat
isfaction either* a3 manager of the circuit
or of the Grauman Theater for some time.
Although Grauman has sold out his
stock in the Pacific_Coast Vaudeville
Company, he still retains an interest In
the Unique Theater, on Market street, of
which Mrs. Straus, former owner of thÂ©
Bay State market, owns the majority of
the stock.
The Pacific Coast Vaudeville Company
was organized" in the month of April of
this year. At the present time, besides
owning tho Grauman Theater in this city,
it also conducts amusement houses in
Oakland, Portland, Or., and Seattle.
In discussing Grauraan's retirement
frpm the vaudeville company ona of the
stockholders said:
"Grauman retired as manager of tha
Pacific Coast Vaudeville Company on Sat
urday. He also sold out his stock at the
sanWtlme. I do not care to discuss the
matter or to criticize Grauman. All I Care
to say'ls that his business methods were
not satisfactory to us.
"Mr. Grauman was using tha attractions
that we imported from the East to play
In the theaters on his minor circuit. In
future we will have features of a ' high
order of merit and will change- the name
of the theater to the Lyceum."
Grauman Is supposed to have made a
nice profit in selling out.

A | number of storekeepers on Third
street appeared before the Supervisors'
Street Committee yesterday to protest
asalnst granting the Barber Asphalt
Company an extension of ninety days
within which to complete its contract to
widen and repave the thoroughfare named
from Mission to Berry streets. The store
keepers bitterly complained that the
wretched condition of the street had
caused business to suffer to the extent of
50 per cent.
Gratz K. Brown of the pavingr company
stated that It was ready to proceed with
the work if it could get work room.
Brown said the railroad company was be
hindhand owing to the difficulty encoun
tered at the crossings. General Manager
Chapman, who I was communicated with
by telephone, said that the United Rail
roads did not desire an extension of time.
President Casey of the Board of Public
Works said the United Railroads had en
tered into a verbal agreement to turn
the cars from Third street at Mission to
Fourth street and thus permit the work
to proceed without hindrance. Casey
added that the company had not lived up
to the agreement, and that the only rem
edy was to compel the company to run Its
cars down Fourth street. The committee
summoned Manager Chapman and Super
intendent of Construction Lynch^o ap
pear before it this morning to seeif the
arrangements suggested could not be car
ried out so the work may proceed.
Tho committee reported In favor of a
resolution requesting the Board of Pub
lic Works to provide a sufficient sum out
of Its county road fund to repair Buena
Vista avenue, one-half of the expense to
be- paid by property-owners. â¢
The committee reported in favor of ac
cepting New Montgomery street. E. A.
Selfridge protested without avail on the
ground that a portion of the street Is pri
vate property. The committee held that
the city Jias a title by user and since 1SS5
has actually owned the street, despite the
fact that the Selfridges have paid taxes
thereon.
The Sanitary Reduction Works was
granted permission to build a spur track
on Rhode Island street.
â¢ The committee reported in favor of the
map. showing the boundaries of the dis
trict affected and to be assessed fpr
changes of grades on Polk and Chestnut
streets; on certain streets on Parnassus
Heights; of ordering the construction of
a sewer in Pine street, between Mason
and Taylor; of referring, to the City En
gineer the complaint of the. University
Mound and Bay View Improvement Club
that tho Board of Public Works has not
removed obstructions in the districts
named.
The committee referred to the City En
gineer the proposed ordinance providing
for a grant to the Western Pacific Rail

Before a fay in the United States Cir
cuit Court yesterday the trial of the eult
cf Mrs. Maud Van Buren against the
Mountain Copper Company, Limited, was
begun. The suit was brought to recover
$30,000 damages alleged to have been sus
tained by the death of her husband, John
Van Buren. who was killed on March 3,
3902, by the caving of a stope In which
he was working. The case was tried in
the Circuit Court last year and the Jury
awarded Mrs. Van Buren 515,000 damages,
but the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals cet aside the verdict and ordered
a new trial.
J. C. Campbell appeared for the com
rteinant and T. C Van Ness for the de
fendant. The testimony for the plaintiff
wts to the effect th*t Van Buren applied
for work above ground and, contrary to
his protest, was sent underground to
work as a mucker, he being at the time
rot experienced in mining and having eo j
informed the agents of the company. It i
v as while so employed that the stope j
caved In and buried Van Buren and his
feven fellow workers.
The contention of the complainant was
that the stope had been improperly tim
bered and that the death of Van Buren
was caused by the gross negligence of
the defendant in failing properly to tim
ber the slope. Mrs. Van Buren testified {
That at the time of the accident she had
been married nine years and was the
mother of three living children: Maud.
Mabel and John.
The trial will be continued this morn
ing, t
Counsel for the other Fide conveys the im
pression that he has been foroed to do to by
their proceedings. I desire to eay such Is not
the case. His account is filed because it Is his
duty to file it, and not because of the proceed
ings instituted by the heirs. He is In court
within a very reasonable time after settling
all the claims against the estate, and is pre
pared to show that the charges made against
him are foundatlonless.
I do not" feel disposed to consent to that, in
view of the fact that there are jurisdlctlonal
defects In the present proceedings that I desire
to fo into. I am not willinff for a continuance.
My client's motives h^ve been irriiURne-i and
I do net feel that he . Vould rest under the im
pvtatlon that he lias not acted for the best ;a
terests of petitioners. He lias come Into court
with his final account and a petition for. find
distribution of the Cogswell estate within' two
weeks after the payment of the lant claim
against the estate, and I submit to the court
that he has shown that he has not ,been dila
tory.
Wheeler appeared disgusted with the
failure of his move. When Partridge
asked that the hearing of both petitions
go over, until August IS, he said:
William G. Henshaw, executor of the
estate of the late Caroline E. Cogswell,
who has been charged' by" the heirs of
Mrs. Cogswell w.ith delaying the distri
bution of her estate in order that he
might be pecuniarily benefited, executed
a flank movement in Judge Troutt's court
yesterday that had the effect of placing
the attorneys for the heirs in a peculiar
position. Through his attorney, Charles
S. Wheeler. Henshaw asked that the pe
tition for partial distribution be dismissed
because he had placed on file an account
of his stewardship and a petition ' for
final distribution of the estate.
Distribution is what the heirs want, but
they hardly expected that it would come
on request of Henshaw, whom they have
branded as an opponent of their interests.
Attorney John S. Partridge, who, with
Walter D. Mansfield, represents the heirs,
refused to dismiss his petition until he
had time to examine. Henshaw's account
and petition.
"It comes at this time,", he said, "like
a thunderclap but of a clear sky and I de
sire time to examine into the documents."
Wheeler, who, up to yesterday, had
used his best endeavors to secure con
tinuances of the hearing of the heirs' peti
tion, easily shifted his position and op
posed the granting of time and suggested
that Partridge consent to the dismissal
of his petition. The latter was obdurate,
however, and refused Wheeler's request,
though he intimated that a dismissal
would follow shortly. He preferred, he
said, that the matter go over until Au
gust 18, the time set for the hearing of
Henshaw's petition. Mansfield said he
was willing to consent to a dismissal, but
Partridge remained firm. He did, how
ever, consent that, the matter should be
heard to-day and Judge Troatt set it for
2 o'clock, when, in all probability, pro
viding the Henshaw petition Is not found
to contain a joker, the Partridge petition
will -be dismissed.

the most successful curative for tortur-

compounded, in proof -of which a
single anointing preceded by a hot bath
â¢with Cuticura Soap, and followed in
the severer cases, by a 'dose of Cutl-
enra Eesolvent, is of ten sufficient to
afford immediate relief in^themost
distressing forms of itching, burning
and scaly humours, permit -rest and
sleep, and point to a speedy cure when
all other remedies fall. It is especially
so in the treatment of infants and chil-
dren, cleansing, soothing and healing
the most distressing of infantile hu-
mours, and preserving, purifying and
beautifying the ekin, scalp and hair.
J Cuticura Ointment possesses, at tho
same time, the charm of satisfying the
simple wants of the toilet, In caring for
the skin, scalp, hair, hands and feet,
from infancy to age, far more effect-

WASHING WITHOUT WATER
Is Like Trying to Get Rid of Dan-
draff Without Herpicide.
Did you ever se^any one trying to wash
themselves without soap or water?
If you did, what would you say of him?
It is every bit as foolish to try to get
rid of dandruff and to prevent baldness
by feeding the germs which cause it with
cantharldes, vaseline, glycerine and simi-
lar substances, which form the principal
ingredients of most so-called hair vigors.
Newbro's Herpicide is successful becau.-e
it attacks and kills the parasitic germ
which feeds on thÂ© hair roots.
It is the original and only genuine sca!p
germicide manufactured. /
