Immediately. With my best wishes for

the bank employ, stating that he had
filled : the office < of cashier with "rare
ability" since the organization of the
Riverside Bank Officials Commend
Him for His Service.

Senator Dietrich had a good defense
and added that the Senator had come
to Washington at this time to bring
about the removal of District Attorney'

Rosewater declared that District At

that they were politically antagonistic.

The claim made by Hays' friends
that the money he made in his real es
tate deals was simply a commission
was refuted to-night by Vice President
Gibbon, who has documentary evidence
Xo show that Hays was appointed con
fidential agent "of the company upon
recommendation of Diss and others,
that he was to receive no direct finan
cial remuneration, that he was to per
form his services in consideration of his
bank getting the Salt Lake Railroad
Company's business and that he was to
be permitted to realize such profit as
might arise from the Increase in values
of. property adjacent to the right of
way by reason of the building of the
road, but not by the direct purchase of
right of way property.
It Is also. known that from the real
estate men In Riverside whom he em
ployed to purchase property, their com
missions to be paid by the sellers, Hays
demanded one-half of that commission
and on one occasion is alleged to have
received $2400 from that source.

now conducting their Investigation.. It
will be impossible for them to secure
restitution In most instances and it
may be impossible for them to fasten
the matter upon any of tneir agents,
but it is admitted that the company
has been heavily mulcted at the in
stance of some persons who occupied
positions of trust. It is promised that
if the. guilt of those persons can .be
positively established the matter will
be v given all possible publicity, and may
be carried Into the criminal courts.
QUESTION OF COMMISSION.
Another plan was to profit by the
manipulation of property In , the vicin
ity of tracts which those Â¦'. in the deal
knew long In advance would be selected
for 'depot purposes. The property near
these tracts would be secured on op
tions before the announcement of the
exact depot site was made, and by rea
son of the Inevitable appreciation in
values oÂ£ this property tho3e. In the
deal would be able to dispose of their
options at .handsome profits and with
but little outlay of money.
\ It Is 'for'the purpose of ascertaining,
if possible, how much the company has
Since the exposure -of the deals at
tention has been called to the fluctua
tions in value of realty all along the
line of the" railroad. The confidential
agents knew, of course, what route the
road would . take and long before the
construction gangs or even the final
surveying parties started along the
known route/persons to whom this in
formation was secretly imparted would
purchase certain property on or near
the proposed right of way.
This Â¦ property was cheap, but It
would be transferred at an increased
figure and after a week or two would
again be transferred at an even higher
price and this would be repeated sev
eral times until the last transfer would
indicate that the property had brought
a good stiff price. Then, when the rail
road : company needed it, the deeds
would, be displayed, showing that the
property had been sold for a good price
and a price In advance of, that would
be demanded of the railroad company,
and with such evidence before It the
price demanded would be paid.
Thus property, the original price of
which was something within reason,
would be forced up in price until the
railroad company would be made to
pay' In some instances twice Ira value.
These operations were not confined to
any given section nor were they too
frequently practiced, but a sufficient
number of such deals were made to
make \t extremely profitable for those
who possessed the inside Information.

both gentlemen refused to enter into a
further discussion of that feature of
the case.
There are abundant indications that
the Salt Lake Railroad Company has
been made the victim of its own con
fidential agents for many months. The
manner in which these agents or others
acting for them profited was extremely
simple and it must have netted them
many thousands of dollars.

At the fishery the fish can be secured
in greater quantities than they can be

its full capacity. Some days as many
as 1,000,000 eggs are secured. People
from the southern par!t of the county
go to the hatchery for the fish, which
are given away after the spawning op
eration. Many millions of young sal

PROMINENT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE PROMINENTLY MENTIONED IN THE SENSATIONAL

PANY IS DECLARED TO HAVE BEEN SWINDLED OUT OF IMMENSE SUMS.
It was announced last night by Vice
Presidents Clark and Gibbon that Ma
jor Diss will soon sever his connection
with the' company. To-day Diss threw
down the gauntlet and declared that
he. will mot resign. He spent the day
at his desk as usual, and after a con
sultation with Messrs. Clark and Gib-,
bon he made the following statement:
"I am still right of way agent of the
Salt ; Lake Railroad. I have not re
signed nor do.I Intend to resign. I know
nothing whatever . and have never
known of the deals In which Mr. Hays
is alleged to have been implicated. Fur-'
ther than this I can, say nothing. .The
transactions' with him, were '_ not con-;
ducted under- my supervision. Any
further Information: must' be secured
from the proper officers of the company,
for my position is that of a'subordl-"
nate."
To-night . Vice Â£ President Gibbon
again , asserted that Major Diss will

company and Vice Â¦ President ' Clark

STATEMENT BY DISS.
As to Hays' guilt there is no doubt,
for he has made a confession, part of
it In writing, and as a result of the
exposure of his dealings he was forced
to resign his position as cashier of the
Orange Growers' National Bank of
Riverside. Whatever c'se Hays may
be, he is loyal to his friends and he has
assumed th? attitude of scapegoat and
is bearing the brunt of the scandal.
It became known to-day that the
transfer of real estate worth $12,000 by
Hays to the railroad company was by
no means considered a full and com
plete settlement with the corporation.
It was understood by him that this
deed was simply a deed of trust to be
held pending the determination of the
exact amount of the money unaccount
ed for. The exact amount having been
determined, "Hays will be called upon"
to pay that amount and If it be more
than $12,000 he must make good the dif
ference; if less, its payment will result
in the restoration to him of the trust
property.
To what extent Major J. W. F. Diss,
right-of-way agent of the Salt Lake
Railroad Company, will be involved, if
at all, is as yet a matter 'of specula
tion. On that subject the railroad offi
cials positively refuse to talk, except
to say that their investigation being
far from complete they cannot say
what the result will be.
CONFESSION IS MADE.
beyond practically compelling
H. T. Hayes of Riverside to convey to
the company property worth ?12,000 to
secure it in some degree against finan
cial loss, have taken no action, there Is
reason to believe that the swindle of
which the company was made a vic
tim will reach much greater propor
tions than was first announced.
â¢ There is also reason to- believe that
Hays was not alone the beneficiary of
the real estate deals, that he did not
alone engineer the affair by which the
company was forced to pay thousands
of dollars to him while he was acting
as its confidential agent, but that there
are others who are benefited thereby.
Whether there are others who had guilty
knowledge of Hays* transactions will
not be known until the company com
pletes Its investigation which was be
gun nearly two months ago and of
which the demanding of security from
Hays was only an incident.

Officials.
A foreigner who has frequently been
at the palace describes the Dowager
Empress as apparently, greatly dis
tressed. The Manchus are beginning
to realize that the loss of the seat of
their dynasty means the loss of their
prestige, and possibly endangers the
succession. After applying to the Amer
ican and Japanese legations for assist
ance, the Chinese Foreign Office admits
that its policy is to await the devel
opments of the Russian-Japanese nego
tiations, hoping that they will result
In a partial restoration of Manchuria. I
The Idea of closer relations between
China and Japan Is spreading rapidly
and is much discussed by officials in
the press.
It is noticeable that China no longer
seeks Eritish assistance regarding
Manchuria,, but consults only the
American and Japanese Ministers In
stead of all of the diplomats, as for
merly.
While the Chinese official world Is
greatly excited over the Manchurlan
situation, the helplessness of the Gov
ernment was never more conspicuously
displayed. Several long councils have
been held at the palace during the last
fortnight, but the highest officials de
vote more energy to Intriguing against
their rivals and trying to shift the re
sponsibility than dealing with the prob
lem of what measures should be token.
Advices from Japan are to the effect
that the Japanese are growing bitter
against England because they believe
that the latter country is unfaithful to
her alliance with Japan. They now
believe that England entered , Into an
alliance with Japan, expecting that its
proclamation would result In Russia
withdrawing from Manchuria and
therefore regarding war as a faint pos
sibility. Russia refused to retire and
now England, fearing that she may be
drawn into war through the alliance,
is exerting her influence as an ally to
induce Japan to recognize what Lord
Cranborne called "Russia's rather spe
cial position in Manchuria." Premier
Balfour's exhortation to Japan to make
moderate demands also is considered
helpful to Russia in the negotiations by
notifying her that England's support of
Japan is lukewarm.
All of Russia's officials in the East
declare that her domination of Man
churia Is necessary for her Interests
and the safety of the Trans-Siberian
Railroad and that Russia must hold all
that she has taken.
Japan has asserted that Russia's ful
fillment of the evacuation convention
is essential to an engagement and has
promised China not to sanction any en
gagement impairing China's sovereign
ty in Manchuria.

MOSCOW, Nov. 16.â The Russian mil

has aroused such an aggressive atti
tude on the part of China that the con

EXPLAINS FOB DIETRICH.
Postmaster Fisher was formerly
Mayor of Hastings and has been prom
inent in Republican politics of Nebras
ka for several years. He said In Omaha
to-night:
"There is really nothing In the
charges and my friends will support
me in my defense. If witnesses had
been permitted to have been cross-ex
amined the result would have been
quite different and no indictment would
have followed, lien have pushed this
matter who were turned down for re
appolntment and have trumped up
* < iiarges to 'get even.' "
The section under vyhich the separate
indictments against Senator Dietrich
and Jacob Fisher are drawn is section
ITR1 of the Revised Statutes of the
United States, which forbids members
of Congress from profiting by contracts
or receiving valuable consideration for
procuring contracts or offices. The
conspiracy indictment is drawn under
section 1.440 of the Revised Statutes.
OMAHA, Nov. 16.â The Federal Grand
Jury to-night returned true bills
against United Slates Senator Charles
If. Dietrich and Postmaster Jacob
Fisher of Hastings, Neb., charging
them with conspiracy and bribery in
connection with the appointment of
Fisher to the position of Postmaster.
The indictments were brought In to the
United States District Court at 6
o'clock. Judge Munger presiding, and
were placed on file- The court merely
accepted the report of the Grand Jury,
makirg no remarks beyond aÂ» order
to the clerk for the filing of the bills.
The indictment against Senator Diet
rich charges that he accepted money
and property in consideration of his
recommending Fisher for appointment
as Postmaster in Hastings. That
against Postmaster Fisher charges him
vith having made an agreement with
Oenator Dietrich by which ;he former
wmm to pay, in property and money.
$1300 for the appointment.
NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE.
Evidence was presented to the Grand
Jury to show that Fisher had bought
posto3ice fixtures from the Grand Army
post at Hastings, of the value of $500,
and later turned the property over to
Senator Dietrich, to whose building
they were moved, and to whom was
paid a rental by the Government. In
addition to turning over this property
it is charged that Fisher paid to the
Senator $800 in cash.
To-night it was said that the Grand
Jury had been investigating the Hast
ings postofflce case for nearly three
v.eeks and that a number of witnesses
were Dresent from Hastings u.nd other
I>oints in the State.
The last witness called before the
<Jrar.d Jury was William Dutton, a
hardware merchart of Hastings, who
gave his testimony to-day. According
to Dutton's testimony he (Dutton) act
ed as Intermediary in all the alleged
transactions between the indicted men.
After hearing his evidence the Grand
Jury excused the remaining witnesses
Â¦who had not testified and at once pre
pared its report.
rOUB OTHER CASES PENDING.
The jury was composed 6f twenty
members, nineteen of whom are said
to have voted for the indictment and
one against it. The members came
from all parts of the State, no two of
them being residents of the same town.
The foreman, Frank E. "White of
Omaha, is secretary of the Grand
Lodge of the Masonic order of Ne
braska. The other members arÂ«- mostly
business and professional men.
Four other cases, said to be of a sim
ilar nature, are being Investigated by
the Grand Jury and a report on all or
part of them is expected very soon.
All are cases in which postoffices and
Postmasters are concerned.
This indictment is said to be the first
ever returned against a United States
Senator on charges of this nature and
caused intense excitement In Govern
ment official circles in Omaha and in
adjoining towns when it became public.
BASIS FOE INDICTMENT.
The fire blazed with remarkable
fierceness and the firemen aver that
when they arrived on the scene oil was
dropping down an inside wall, the
flames following: It down. Detectives
have been engaged to investigate the
matter and the incident promises to
have interesting developments.
The County Clerk say." the loss to the
county in uncpllectedtaxesi will be iÂ«r

At the last election U. W- Conder was
elected Judge. Last month, at his in
stigation, the County Court empowered
a firm of accountants to expert the
county books. These men began, their
labors last Monday. The books had

cause of the fire.

issued a statement in which 'he an
nounced the policy of the company. He
said that if an extra session of the Leg
islature were called and proper legis
lation passed insuring fair trials â that
is, impartial Judges to try cases in thu
District Court and review the facts In
equity cases In the Supreme Courtâ the
mines and smelters would resume oper
ations.
GOVERNOR TOOLE'S ATTITUDE.
Before calling the extra session Gov
ernor Toole addressed a letter to Scal
lon, in which he said that the inherent
Infirmity of President Scallon's propo
sition, as well as of the petitions, was
that which made the passage of the
legislation mentioned a condition prece
dent to the resumption of work by the
several companies. Governor Toole
said that, nowever much he prayed for
a resumption of work on account of the
present and prospective conditions of
those lately employed in the suspended
Industries and the business Interests of
the communities directly affected, he
was firm in his opinion that It were far
better for the State of Montana as a
whole that this calamity, bad as it was,
should continue indefinitely than that
a precedent should be established by
which legislation of a given kind should
be made a condition precedent to the
doing or omission of any act by any
corporation or individual in this State.
Governor Toole made the proposal, so
to speak, to call 'the extra session If
President Scallon and the other man
agers of the works recently suspended
would at once resume operations. Upon
receipt of the letter, President Scallon
and the other managers addressed a
communication to Governor Toole, re
plying in the affirmative. The procla
mation was at once issued, and an hour
later the men were going toward the
mines and smelters in Butte, Ana
conda and Great Falls, In readiness to
begin work on the next shift.
PREPARING FOR BATTLE.
In all parts of the State everything
in the industrial lines is already as
suming its normal shape. The trouble,
however, has only been postponed a
few weeks, and - Helena will be the
arena for the combat, which will dem
onstrate whether F. Augustus Heinze
or the Amalgamated Copper Company
will reign. Heinze Is massing his forces
for battle and will no doubt use all his
strength and energies to prevent the
"fair trial" bills passing, which would
result in his mining litigation being re
moved from the District Courts of Sil
ver Bow County. The Amalgamated
Copper Company is confident, however,
that It can secure the enactment of
such legislation, as it claims a majority
of both houses of the Legislature.
At the session two years ago a "fair
trial" bill was passed, but when it was
attempted to put It into force the ques
tion as to its constitutionality was
raised. The case was taken Into the
Supreme Court, . which rendered a de
cision declaring it unconstitutional.
Heinze was again victorious. It will
now be up to the Amalgamated to have
bills. framed that will stand the test â
that cannot be declared unconstitu
tional by the Supreme Court.
The scenes of two, four and six years
ago, when Heinze and Senator W. A.
Clark were linked together against a
common . enemy, and when they .fought
each other; when Clark was -arrayed
against the late Marcus Daly, and the
memorable fight carried Into the cham
bers of the White House in Washing
ton; when F. Augustus Heinze fought
the Amalgamated . Copper Company
tooth and nail, are recalled vividly
during these v days preceding the special
sesson of the Legislature.
In the meantime, the legislative
halls are being put into order for the
second special session called within
two years; hotels are receiving calls
for rooms and the lobbyist is abroad.
It is expected that each side will have
a large following of the latter and that
they will be "getting busy" within a
short time.
Discretion is the better part of minding
your own business.

COMPMCATIONS MAKE
LAWSUIT INTERESTING
Contest Over Will in San Diego En-
The direct cause of the shutdown of
the Amalgamated properties in Mon
tana on October 12 were two decisions
recently handed down by Judge Wil
liam Clancy in Butte. One gave the
Minnie Healy mine to F. Augustus
Heinze. This is valued at $10,000,000
and the case was being tried for the
second time. Â¦ In the first trial Judge
Clancy decided In favor of Heinze and
the case was appealed to the Supreme
Court, which sent it back for a new
trial.. Judge Clancy again rendered a
decision in favor of Heinze and another
appeal will be taken. The second de
cision was the one which prevented the
Amalgamated Copper Company voting
any of the stock of the Boston and
Montana Company, an injunction be
ing issued against the company. This
suit was instituted by John MacGin
nlss, agent for Heinze.
The Amalgamated Copper Company
then claimed that it could not obtain
fair trials in the Judiciary of Silver
Bow County and announced that until
legislation was enacted Insuring: it fair
trials It would close Its works. The tlo
up came and more than 20,000 men were
thrown out of employment, either di
rectly or indirectly. In Butte alone it
cut off a pay, roll of $25,000 a day. Rail
roads laid off their fright crews for
merly engaged in hauling ore to the
smelters and coal from the mines;
storekeepers discharged their clerks
and various industries. were paralyzed.
The Cokedale coal, mines shut down
and lumbering crews In Western Mon
tana were discharged. Business in
Butte was practically suspended and
the effect reached even Into Utah and
W,yoming, where coal mines drawn
upon by the Amalgamated felt the
effect of the storm. ; . ,
Shortly after the shutdown President
William Scallon of the. Anaconda Cop
per Mining^ Company, in response to an
inquiry from the Butte Miners' Union,
TWO FAMOUS DECISIONS.
In accordance with Governor Toole's
letter from President William Scallon
of the Anaconda Copper Mining Com
pany, the latter's properties in Butte
and smelters in Anaconda and Great
Falls have resumed work and more
than 20,000 men who have been idle
for two weeks are again employed.
How long this condition will last is not
known and many persons are anxiously
awaiting the outcome of the legislative
session. If that body fails to pass laws
to relieve the present situation in the
courts the public, shudders even to
think of what may be the next move
in the greatest copper war ever waged.
From the time of the closing of the
Anaconda Copper Company's prop
erties in Montana petitions from labor
organizations throughout the State', to
gether with lengthy documents from
other organizations, poured into the
executive office in Helena asking Gov
ernor Toole to call an extra session.
Twenty were received in one day and
they came from all portions of North
ern, Central and Western Montana.
Petitions and letters received repre
sented almost three-quarters of the
population of the western half of Mon
tana, and as the wishes of the people
were thus conveyed Governor Toole
called an extra session.

! DEBATE OPENED BY PAYNE.
Payne opened the debate, urging the
passage of the bill. Payne said that no
harm would be wrought' to the sugar
industry by the legislation now pro
posed and likewise the tobacco industry
could not be harmed by ..the proposed
new arrangemc-nt. He added that, no
industry would be affected by the per
fection of the treaty. He said, in reply
to an inquiry, that he did not expect
new industries' to, be established while
this question was being agitated.
; . "Our national pride appeals to us to
pass the bill," said Payne, in conclu
sion. ; .. , .. * . . ;Â¦
Williams denied that the minority de
sired to amend the bill in. order to.kfll
the treaty.. He read the minority rfe
port, giving the reasons why. the mi
nority desired to amend the 'bill. Wil
liams held the Republicans responsible
for the fact that the treaty was not- in
effect to-day. Referring, to Payne,
Williams said: ' \ .. . â -
"As to that part of his 'speech 'which
advocates this bill upon Its merits," it
is almost as sudden a conversion " as
1 that of St. Paul on his way to Damas
cus; it is almost as sudden. an occur
rence as was the recent birth of the
new republic of Panama." ; .
Williams spoke only a few minutes,
reserving the' right to class sJhe debate
for the minority.
ATTACKS TARIFF POLICY.
With the announcement of the vote
Williams asked for unanimous consent
to propose an amendment to the rule
for an aye and no vote on tho amend
ment reported by the minority, with
twenty minutes' discussion fan each
side, a vote then to be taken on the
bill. Payne objected. The House then
went into committee of the whole With
Sherman of New York in the- chair.
The short debate which preceded the
adoption of the rule was followed by
several speeches on the merits of the
measure. Payne opened the debate in
a speech whose keynote was that the
measure would not affect injuriously
sugar, tobacco or any other interests.
For the minority. Representatives Wil
liams of Mississippi, Swanson of Vir
ginia and Robinson of Indiana made
speeches criticizing the Republicans
for their tariff policies and the exces
sive taxation of the duty. Robinson
predicted danger to our foreign com
; merce from higher foreign tariffs un
; less we Incited tariff reforms, and de
clared the tariff question again would
become a burning political issue.
I DAiZELL REPORTS THE RULE.
Dalzell (Republican) of Pennsylvania
i reported the resolution providing that
! the bill reported from the Ways and
[ Means Committee should be considered
I to the exclusion of other business until'
; 4 o'clock Thursday, when a vote should
I be taken without intervening motion.
Williams of Mississippi, speaking for
j the minority in opposition to the rule,
! declared it was about the most drastic
j rule ever Introduced in the House, as
! it shut off all right to perfect the bill.
, He said that the minority desired to
offer an amendment which proposed
i to strike out ' the "double-barreled
i pledge" contained in the bill. Ap

I en the statement that the bill tore down
] one-fifth of the schedules built up by
i the Republicans. The amendment it was
i desired to offer was the one decided
upon in the Democratic caucus on Sat
urday night.
Dalzell, replying to the charge that
j the rule was a most drastic measure,
] reverted to the time when the Wilson
i bill was pending, Crisp being Speaker,
J saying that he commended the minority
j to a study of its own parliamentary
I history.-
Williams demanded the ayes and
noes on the adoption of the rule and
they were ordered. The rule was
adopted, 176 ayes to 155 noes. . ,

doture rule by a party vote, with the
exception that six Republican mem

on the ground that it was drastic and
prevented a vote being taken on any
amendment . to the, bill, while 'the six

tho Senate adjourned.
More Petitions Against Smoot.
The resort says that If the amend
ment Is adopted the minority would
gladly vote for the bill; but, even if de
feated, they recommend its- passage,
"because," the report Plates, "we think
that the good to be done by- Its passage
will far overbalance the evil which will
result from a failure to take advantage
of the opportunity to diminish the pow
er of the sugar trust." Â¦
"Because," the report says, "in .our
opinion we would thereby deprive the
great sugar trust of this country of
some of , its power to extort from the
consumer, curtail Its power to bear
down the price "of the raw material,
thereby injuring the sugar planter, and
lessen its ability to dictate to wholesale
and. retail dealers in sugar the manner
In which they shall do business and the
price at which they shall sell refined
sugar."
Robinson of Indiana, taking as his '
text a treasury statement, argued f
against the Republican policy, which, j
he said, was that of excessive taxation. |

MINORITY REPORT IS FILED.
A minority report setting forth the
views of . Williams of Mississippi,
Swanson of Virginia, McClellan of New
York and Clark of Missouri on the
Cuban bill was filed in the House to
day. Cooper of Texas, also a member
of the minority on the Ways and
Means Committee, presented a lengthy
-report condemning the Cuban treaty
in toto.
Cooper does not believe Cuban reci
procity will benefit either Cuba or the
United States. In his opinion, he says,
there also are grave doubts regarding
the constitutionality of the bill.
The proposed legislation. Cooper says,
is both undemocratic and unrepublican
â undemocratic, because the bene- i
ficiaries are the sugar refining interests ;
and some other special interests, and |
the benefits they will receive will have j
to be made by an additional tax on the
whole people upon some other article;
unrepublican, in that it deliberately j
seeks to injure and Interfere with a
home industry by lowering tariff rates
which protect that Industry, and thus
directly inviting and stimulating a for
eign industry. The treaty, he says,
violates both the principle of the tariff
for revenue and tariff for protection."
One of the strongest objections to the
bill lies against the*extraordinary sup
plemental provision prohibiting the
House of Representatives from making
any further reductions in the duty on
sugar during the life of the treaty.
Legislation such as is proposed in this
bill, he declares, will assuredly anger
and alienate other friendly powers.
TEXT OF MINORITY REPORT.
The minority report, signed by four
Democratic members of the Ways and
Means Committee, states that the bill
should be amended by striking out the
provision that no reduction in sugar
duty should be made during the life of
the treaty, declaring that one Congress
has no right to bind succeeding Con
gresses, and, by inserting an amend
ment, striding out the differential on
refined sugar. .-. ' t
passed in other countries in retaliation I
for the Dingley act. He. insisted that
unless concessions were made from the
present tariff before long - all \ Europe \.
would be combined in commercial war
fare against the United States. He dis- [
cussed Chamberlain's policy, saying I
that 55 per cent of our foreign trade j
was with the United Kingdom and her \
colonies, all of which, he said, was t
jeopardized by this policy. Swanson j
then discussed the evil 'which he said j
resulted from the failure of this coun
try.to negotiate. a treaty .with Canada.
The exclusive policy of the Dingley act,
he declared, would destroy our for- !
elgn commerce, arfd" he remarked that j
the Republican party would never mod
ify it. â¢.

CALL BUREAU, 140C G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.âCon
verse J. Smith, special agent of the
customs service, stationed at Boston,
who was mentioned as the possible,
choice for Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury before the appointment of
Keep, resigned by wire to-day, f Secre
tary of the Treasury Shaw immediately
telegraphed his acceptance of the res
ignation. His resignation follows hard
upon the Inquiry made by the Treas
ury Department into the operations of
his office in connection with the case of
the Glasgow Manufacturing Company
of Boston, the alleged operations of
which have, it is estimated, cost the
Government hundreds utf thousands of
dollars. The attention of the Treasury
Department was directed to this firm
several months ago by evidence that it
was selling imported lace goods at re
markably low figuresâ so low as to
cause the suspicion that the goods had
not paid the full amount of duty re
quired by the Dingley law.
Smith, being the \ special agent in
charge of the investigation of irregu
larities at the port of Boston, was di
rected to investigate the case. In duo
time a report was received from him
saying that there was no ground for
suspicion and that the Glasgow Manu
facturing company was all right.
The Treasury Department was not
satisfied and Special Agents Ralph
Clayton and Solon Norton, on duty at
New York, were directed to go to Bos
ton and make an investigation entirely
independent of Smith and his force.
They did this and the result was^ the
seizure of thirteen cases of imported
â¢lace goods and the . accumulation of
evidence that. the department believes
to be sufficient to convict members of
the Glasgow Manufacturing Company
if not also some men connected with
the Government service.

REDDING, Nov. 16.â An old man
named William Ross was drowned in a
small stream near the Fall River Mills
Electric Light Works to-day. Ross had
fallen into the stream and was drowned
in six Inches of water. Foul play was
at first suspected, but at the investiga
tion accidental death was clearly
proved. Ross* body was found by Died,
rick Knock. The stream' ran, through
Knock's field. Several witnesses, were
examined and all testified that in their
opinion Ross met his death accidentally.
It was deemed inadvisable to call the
Coroner.
The unfortunate old man was a pio
neer of the Fall River country and at
one time had large bands of cattle on
the ranges. He lost all in a heavy snow
storm. He had no known relatives in
this country and was burled by the
people in the community. â¢

her daughter's tragic death made her dan
gerously ill, it is said, and her physician
was in constant attendance at all the sit
tings of the commissioner. â¢
Mrs. Nelson testified that after her hus
band's death she was Induced to go to
San Francisco, where the agents of Mrs.
Herman Oelrichs and Mrs. W. K. Vander
bllt Jr. induced her to relinquish her
claim to the $8,000,000 estate by alleging
fraudulently that they had cablegrams
showing that Mrs. Fair died instantly and
her husband survived her, which. If true,
would destroy Mrs. Nelson's right to the
estate. As a result, she accepted $125,000
to sign over agreements relinquishing her
rights, she says.

amined are physiciansâ Albert Perrlquet

WASHINGTON, Nov. 16. â The
crowning event in the centennial an
niversary of the historic New York
avenue Presbyterian Church in this
city occurred to-night, when a public
meeting was held which was attended
by many of the best known officials
in the city. They included President
Roosevelt and Secretary Hay, both of
whom made addresses; Secretaries
Moody, Shaw, Hitchcock and Cortel
you, Attorney General Knox, the
greater number of the Justices of the
Supreme Court of the United States
and Senator Frye. Justice Harlan pre
sided. The President and Secretary
Hay occupied the Lincoln pew and
both had something to say of the mar
tyred President, Secretary Hay's brief
address being confined exclusively to
that subject. President Roosevelt said,
in part:
"We can divide and must divide on
party lines as regards the vital ques
tions. We cannot afford to divide, but
I have the right to challenge the best
effort of every American worthy of the
name to putting down by every means
in his power corruption in private life,
and, above all. corruption in public life.
And, remember you, the people of this
government by the people, that while
the public servant, the Legislature, the
executive officer, the Judge are not to
be excused if they fall short of their
duty, yet their doing their duty cannot
avail unless you do yours. In the last
resort we have to depend upon the Jury
drawn from the people to convict the
scoundrel who has tainted our public
life, and unless that jury does its duty,
unless It Is backed by the sentiment of
the people, all the work of legislators,
of executive officer, of judicial officer
is for naught.
"It would be trite to say anything
about Lincoln and yet I am going to
point to one thing: In reading his
works and speeches, his addresses, one
is struck by the fact that as he went
higher and higher all personal bitter
ness seemed to die out of him. In the
Lincoln-Douglass debates one can still
catch now and then a note of personal
antagonism; the man was in the arena
and as the blows were given and taken
you could see now and then that he
had a feeling against his antagonist.
When he became President and faced
the crisis that he had to face from that
time on I do not think that you can
find any expression, a speech of Lin
coln, a word of Lincoln, written or spo
ken, in which bitterness is shown to
any man. His devotion to the cause
was so great that he neither could nor
would have feeling against any indi
vidual."
SAN* DIEGO. Nov. 16.â Fire this after
noon destroyed the entire roof cf St. Jo
sephs Catholic Church, which Is the larg
est in the city. The loss will be between
JTQOC and 58000.
The fire started in a small storeroom at
the left of the altar and pulpit and the
exact cause is likely never to be known.
There was no one In the church and there
has been no fire of any kind in the store
room for days. Matches and candles
were stored there and some are inclined
to tind a cause in mice and matches,
since it is hard to explain the fire in any
other way.
The flames found a way upward in a
t-mall closet which reached the top of the
room and made a way into the large open
ppace between the celling of the audito
rium and the metal roof. There the fire
found plenty to feed upon and it could not
b*> reached easily cr quickly by the fire
men. Most of the supporting trusses and
rafters were burned out so that the roof
dropped to some extent in two or three
places. It is probable that the entire roof
Â¦will have to come off and be rebuilt. The

Senator^ Lodge's son-in-law, Captain A.
P. Gardner, comes , to /Washington . from
He wrote his acceptance oi' " the ap
pointment on a piece of birch bark, and
from that time out has been known as
"Birch Bark" Bede. Bede comes to Con
gress under Republican auspices. He is
a newspaper man, formerly wrote "edito
rial paragraphs for a Washington paper,
and is now running a weekly the sub
scription price of which is but 25 cents
a year, but which is taken by practically
all the politicians In the Northwest. In
1S90 he made a speech in a political con
vention that stamped him as a humorist.
His friends say that he Just can't help
being funny, and that he will make a
bigger hit than did "Private" John Allen,
of Mississippi, â¢ whose retirement to the
shades of Tuepole robbed Congress of Tts
leading performer in this line.
Halver Steenerson, of the Ninth Min
nesota District, will be pointed out as
the man who once seconded the nomina
tion of James G. Blaine In a national
convention. He is a lawyer, more than
six feet tall and of striking appearance.
The retirement of Kahn and Loud is
much regretted here. Mr. Kahn won a
high place of influence in the House,
while Mr. Loud's service as the head of
the Postofflce Committee for many years
has been of the most valuable and im
portant character.
Chairman "Dave" Mercer of the'Public
Buildings and Grounds Committee went
down to defeat in Nebraska before Wil
liam J. Bryan's close political and person
al friend, Gilbert M. Hitchcock, editor of
the Omaha World-Herald. | Mr. Bryan and
Mr. Hitchcock were editorially associated
on this paper, and the latter practically
was the Democratic Presidential candi
date's personal representative at the Kan
sas City convention. Hitchcock is about
40 years old. .;
Alfred Lucking of Detroit will be an
other character. ;, Lucking's victim .was
Representative Corliss, whose advocacy of
a Pacific cable brought/down upon" him'
the influence of such forces as made his
re-election Impossible." Lucking Is a law
yer and a partner of the present Mayor of
Detroit Ho is a man of ability. He has
never, taken , before more than a local or
State interest. in active, politics, but is a
straightout Democrat. - ' .- . . '
CAN'T HELP BEING FUNNY.
The prophets see in J. Adam Bede, of
the Duluth district, the- wit of the present
House. Bede's career, like Ltnd's, Is a
varied one, especially its political end.
Beginning as a Prohibitionist, it did not
take him long to throw a handspring into
the Democratic ranks, and from there tho
Republican party was reached by easy
stages. President Cleveland appointed
him as the compromise candidate for
United States Marshal of Minnesota.
F. B. Harrison, a Democrat hailing
from the Thirteenth New York District,
is a son of Mrs. Burton Harrison, whose
husband was the private secretary of
Jefferson Davis. He comes from the
fcwell Fifth-avenue negihborhood, and
he himself is quite a social leader.
Minnesota will manage to keep herself
well to. the front by the changes and
additions she has made in her delega
tion. Perhaps the most interesting feat
ure of the election out that way was
the return of ex-Governor John Llnd to
Congress, after an absence of some years.
His eourse will be watched closely, be
cause it has been predicted that, though
elected as a Democrat, he will take an
independent attitude. This prediction is
based upon the fact that his speeches
during the campaign were rather favor
able to President Roosevelt, and because
in his time he has been Republican, Free
Silver Republican, Popul'st and Demo
crat. His friends think it is about time
for him to start around the circle once
more. Mr. Lind is a self-made man and
is a ready debater. He is a native of
Sweden, but has been in this country
since childhood. It is thought that he has
his eye on the United States Senate as
the successor of Knute Nelson, with
whom he has been at strife for a long
time. Lind succeeds in Congress Loren
Fletcher, a well-known Republican mem
ber, who was renomlnated, but failed of
election.
His nephew, "Little Tim" Sullivan, is
an Assemblyman, and the whole Sullivan
family are in politics one way or another.
The annual picnics, fathered and paid for
by "Big Tim," are famous. The new
Congressman is no orator, but he talks
plainly and to the point. He talks a
sort of Bowery dialect, but not the kind
you read in the New York papers.
FROM., THE SMART SET.
Its consistent practice has made him a
power In that great political organization
Tammany Hall, and by many he is cred
ited with being the most influential of its
members. At the age of 42 Sullivan,
though himself a seller of liquors, never
touches them himself; neither does he
smoke. His only vice is gambling, and of
this he makes no concealment. He will
bet on anything at any timeâ and almost
Invariably loses. He runs a theater and
is the president of a beer pump company.
In New York he can always be found at
one of two placesâ at the Occidental Hotel
on the Bowery, where he lives, despite
his income Is something near $50,000 a
year, or holding up the iron railing in
front of the Gllsey House.
Of course, it was his famous East Side
constituency that sent him there, as it
also sent him to Congress. He looks after
the folks in his neighborhood as a father
cares for his childrenâ buys them food
and fuel and clothes, pays the. doctors'
and undertakers' bills, loans and gives
money and bails out or pays the fines of
those of his friends who happen to get
tangled up in the meshes of the law. It
Is this .broad-minded, indiscriminate and
unquestioning philanthropy upon which
the power of Sullivan is founded, and a
very substantial foundation it is.
"BIG TIM" A PATRIARCH.
CA.LL BUREAU, 1406 G Street N.
TV., Washington," Nov. 16.â The
386 men who compose the
House in the Fifty-eighth Con
gress, now in extraordinary session, af
ford an interesting study. Among them
are many who return to Washington
year after year and their services here
have made their names household
words throughout the land; but there
are many new faces that have yet to
make their impress upon the public.
The old graybeards of legislation, like
Payne and Cannon and Dalzell and Hep
burn and Grosvenor, and the oratorical
wonders, like Cousins of Iowa and Clark
of Missouri and Williams ' of Mississippi
and Littlefleld of Maine, are sure to
attract the attention of the galleries, but
before the session is closed from among
thy members whose names are now mean
ingless to the great mass of the Ameri
can public may come personalities whom
fame will claim as her own. Certainly a
cursory glance at the list of candidates
who were successful in the Congressional
contests leads to the belief that the lower
house has been enriched by no small num
ber of interesting and original figures.
New York City contributes two new
members, who for one reason or another
will be observed with interest Of these
two "Big Tim" Sullivanâ or, as he is on
the books, "T. D. Sullivan" â should in
some respects be classed first. Sullivan
probably could not have come to Con
gress . but from one of the" great cities,
and possibly New York is the only one
of these in which he could hope to be
elected. From selling newspapers as a
boy he graduated into the saloon busi
ness, and then, having amassed no small
amount of money, he chose to go to the
State Senate for six or seven terms.
Two members of the present House
of long service who retired from mem
bership last March are Grow of Penn
sylvania and Hopkins of Illinois, the
latter of whom was transferred to
the Senate. Grow, who retired volun
tarily from public life, was first elected
to Congress fifty-two years ago and ten
years later was Speaker of the House.
He has served altogether twenty-two
years, having re-entered the House in the
Fifty-third Congress after an absence o.'
thirty years. Hopkins has been a mem
ber for eighteen years, two years les*
than Speaker Henderson's service.
Hitt of Illinois has served for twenty
two years, while Hepburn of Iowa has a
record of sixteen years' membership. Hep
burn first came in as a member of the
Forty-seventh Congress, but from the
Fiftieth to the Fifty-second Congresses,
both inclusive, he was out of public life,
returning, however, in the Fifty- third
Congress. "'â¢ ,
Dalzell of Pennsylvania has been a
member for sixteen years. General Gros
venor of Ohio came into the House two
years before Dalzell. They are the right
hand men of the Speaker.
SOME OF THE OLD-TIMERS.
t Nearly all the old leaders of the House
have been returned . to * the Fifty
eighth Congress. ' All the chairmen >of
important committees in v . the present
House were re-elected with the ex
ception of Loud of California, chair
man of the Postofllce Committee, and
Mercer of Nebraska, at the head of the
(Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds. A large proportion of the old
members have seen exceptionally long
service in the House. General Harry
Blngham of Pennsylvania is the "father"
of the House, and at the expiration
of his term in the Fifty-eighth Con
gress will have seen twenty-six vears of
continuous service there. Two or three
other members of the House have besn
members longer than General Bingham,
but their service has not been continuous.
General Ketcham of New York was
first elected to Congress forty years ago
and at the expiration of his term in the
Fifty-eighth Congress will have served
thirty-two years in the House. Speaker
Cannon has been a member twenty-eight
years, but his service has not been con
tinuous, as he was defeated for re-election
to the Fifty-second Congress in 1S90.
Judge Badger, Democrat, who suc
ceeds Representative Tompkins, is the
man who pulled. the nose &t former Rep
resentative Lentz, who once represented
the -district in Congress. Alva Adams,
Democratic Congressman-at-Largc from
Colorado, was formerly Governor of that
State. Frank B. Brandegee of the
Third Connecticut District is one of the
most popular Republicans in the State
and the son of a former member of the
Republican National Committee.
Ollle James of Kentucky, Democrat,
is a physical giant with a' baby face and
altogether a picturesque figure. J. AJ
Sullivan, who had the distinction of de
feating Eugene N. Foss, brother of the
chairman, of the House Naval Affairs
Committee, in a Republican district in
Massachusetts, is a popular Democrat
who has long figured In politics and
won a reputation as a vote getter. With
these may be classed Representative
"Billy" Lorimer, former streetcar driver
and present Republican boss of Chicago,
Â¦who returns to the House after a term
spent out of Congress, in which he won
celebrity ! as the successful manager of
Representative Hopkins' Senatorial fight.
George Shlras comes here from Pitts
burg as 'a Democrat. He is a son of Jus
tice Shira's of the United States Supreme
Court and has. been for a long time a fig
ure in politics in the Smoky City.'
D. L/. D. Granger, the Democrat who
succeeded in breaking up the solid Con
gressional delegation of two from Rhode
Island, is a former Mayor ofV Providence
and a gold Democrat and protectionist.
H. O. Young, Republican, of the Twelfth
Michigan District, is a mine operator. A.
H. Jackson, who defeated Representative
Norton, Democrat, in Ohio, was formerly
a peddler and circus man.
PULLED THE NOSE OF LENTZ.
the Sixth Massachusetts District. Cap
tain Gardner comes of a rich and aristo
cratic family. He is a graduate of Har
vard, enjoys large wealth, and is a lover
of athletics and sports in general. He
made a brilliant record during the Porto
Rican campaign in the Spanish war as a
member of the staff of General j James H.
"Wilson. He received one of the medals
awarded for distinguished services in thÂ«
Porto Rican campaign. He has been a
member of the Massachusetts Senate, and
is 35 years old. Butler Ames, from the
Lawrence district, a grandson of General
B. F. Butler, is a graduate of -West Point
and a very promising young man.
W. S. McNarj'i who succeeds Represent
ative Naphen in the Tenth -Massachusetts
District, is a well-known leader of the
Boston Democracy.
Frederick' J. Landis, the â¢ successor of
the veteran Representative Steele in the
Eleventh Indiana District, is probably
the youngest member of the House,
being but 27 years old.' He is black
haired and black eyed and looks and
dresses like an actor. He was private
secretary "to his brother, Representative
Charles B. Landis. in the Fifty-fifth Con
gress, but went home at the end of the
session declaring that he would not re
turn to Washington save as a member ot
the House, and he has made good his
boast. His brother having been re-elect
ed, the Landis. boys from Indiana will cut
quite a figure here winter after- next.
Of course, Judge Birdsall â¢ is pointed
out as the man who stepped in and won
out handsomely in Speaker Henderson's
district when that distinguished Iowan
withdrew from the contest. He is a good
lawyer and should make a good Congress
man.

' The Californian, the college dally,
also paid a tribute to Professor Syle In
the editorial columns this morning,
saying of him "that his name is dear
to hundreds of students who have had
the opportunity of listening to him in
the classroom."
President Wheeler of the University
of .California presents a eulogy of the
late Professor L. Du Pont Syle, form
erly professor of English literature and
dramatic art, in a memorial letter pub
lished to-day at the university. The
letter, reads as follows:
The untimely end of Professor Syle's
career as scholar, and teacher must
bring pain to every one who had occasion
to know his brilliant gifts and to expe
rience the helpfulness of his instruction.
He possessed undoubtedly a rare sense
for the fineness and dignity of English
dramatic literature and had shown unus
ual tact and good taste in giving English
plays a worthy setting upon the college
stage. Any one who saw the Charter
Day play of .1900 could not fail to know
that a master hand was in control. It
would. I believe, have given highest sat
isfaction to his talents and to his ambi
tion could he have developed here a de
partment of dramatic criticism and art,
using the actual representation of plays
as the concrete and practical form of
instruction, through which the theoreti
cal and ideal might be given body and
form. His natural talents as a teacher
were greatly enhanced in value by a,
natural interest which he took In the
Interest and the points of view of those
he taught. There are hosts of students
from many classes who bear thankful
ness toward him in their hearts, not only
for what he taught them, but for the In
terest he showed in their troubles and
perplexities as well as in their joys and
successes. In the face of these sunnier
memories of his work and desire we for
get the shadows that ill health brought
upon his mood and life; for the sunshine
is there forever, and the shadows are
but for a day.

WASHINGTON/' Nov. 16.â Governor
Brodie of Arizona in his annual report
to the. Secretary. of the Interior urges
that the. Interior Department aid in se
curing the passage of an enabling act
for the admission of Arizona to State
hood. He says, however, that the peo
ple of the Territory would rather fore
go Statehood "ihan accomplish it by
union with any other State or part of
any other State or Territory.
The Governor recommends that Con
gress reimburse Pima County for $318,
275 for what the Governor calls "an
injustice committed by Congress in
passing an act validating certain Pima
County narrow gauge railroad bonds,
after the entire issue of such bonds
had been declared by the Supreme
Court of the United States to be in
valid - and void, and for which Pima
County had never received value.".
The Governor recommends that the
Indian school facilities In Arizona be
increased and that measures be taken
to more properly care for the gradu
ates of these schools by finding for them
proper employment; that a levee be
built to prevent the overflow of culti
vated land along the Colorado River
by the annual freshets; that a. system
of tree planting be inaugurated by the
Division of Forestry for the benefit of
the watersheds of the Territorial
streams and that irrigation projects be
pushed. \ â¢
The total population of Arizona is es
timated at 155,000. The total taxable
wealth aggregates $43,088,041 and the
total Territorial indebtedness is placed
at $1,064,594.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.â The .pro
test of Paymaster Briscoe and Lieuten
ant Williams of the navy regarding the
' language used by Rear Admiral Evans
In reviewing the findings of the court
which tried Assistant Paymaster R-
Nicholson presented to the Navy De
partment a knotty problem. The pro
test went direct from the Bureau of
Navigation to the Secretary of the
Navy without the judge advocate gen
eral passing on it. After considering the
matter in all its details, it is said. Sec
retary Moody concluded to sustain Ad
miral Evans. Later the Secretary
changed his mind and at Secretary
Moody's instance Assistant Secretary
Darling took the matter up. It is under
stood he takes the position that Ad
miral Evans in unequivocal terms at
tacked the integrity of the members of
the court, and that, having done thia,
and if he had the evidence at hand to
sustain his charge, it was his duty at
once to order a court-martial of the
officers to whom his remarks were di
rected. Not having so acted, it is un
derstood, Mr. DarHngr holds that the
admiral was derelict in hla duty and
should be reprimanded. The matter
had reached this stage when Secretary
Moody determined to enlist the legal
talents of Secretary Root, who. It is
understood, has given his view of the
case.
It is said to-day that it is Secretary
Moody's present intention to return to
Admiral Evans the findings In the
Nicholson case, with a notification that
he had decided to dismiss the protest
of the two officers, Briscoe and Wil
liams, but warning the admiral not to
repeat the 'offense.
The matter contained in the envelopes
complained of is what is purported to be
a Register and Directory of Qualified
Veterinary- Surgeons in the State of Cal
ifornia, which list has been widely cir
culated among the stock owners through
out the State, in which purported list
the undersigned names have been pur
posely omitted, for the reason that the
undersigned did, during the session
of the last Legislature, oppose certain
measures that said association was lob
bying through the Legislature of this
State.
We ask that a hearing of this matter
be accorded us and that we be allowed to
present evidence as to improper and un
just acts of said C. H. Blemmer.

geons, believing that their names were
with malice omitted from tfle roster re
cently published by the California State
Veterinary; Association because they

ALAMEDA. Nov. 10. 1903.
To the Hon. George C. Pardee, Gover
nor of California: We, the undersigned,
most respectfully call your attention to
the following unjust and improper acts
of C. II. Blemmer, State Veterinarian of
California, and charge the said Blemmer
with prostituting his official position by
causing literature of a private Institu
tion, the California State Veterinary
Medical Association (which literature is
intended' to injure the business of and
destroy the good names of the under
signed, regularly licensed graduate vet

be inclosed in envelopes bearing the fol
lowing print:

association is an accredited institution
of this State, with headquarters at the

Miss Henniger accompanied Fred Strub
ble, a neighbor's son, to a supper and so
cial given at the country schoolhouse,. a
short distance from the girl's home, Sat
urday evening. ..When she failed to re
turn her parents were greatly alarmed,
but as neither she nor Strubble could be
found, it was supposed that they had
eloped and would be heard from in a few
days. The discovery of the girl's remains
aroused the community, but all efforts of
the authorities to locate Strubble'a where
abouts have proven unavailing. The con
dition of the body Indicated a desperate
struggle. The girl was the daughter of
Newton Henniger, a prominent farmer.
PEORIA, 111., Nov. 16.â Miss May Hen^
niger, a prominent young lady of Bishop,
who was supposed to have eloped, was

home. Her body was mutilated and half

TAKES OFF TWO
THROUGH TRAINS
A plea for mercy was made by Dun
bar's attorney, T. V. Eddy, who stated
to the court that the prisoner had
saved the, county the expense of a trial
and also that he was the only surviv
ing child of an aged mother. Judge
Ellsworth in reply said the most pain
ful part of his duty was the infliction
of suffering upon innocent persons
through the wrongdoing of those con
nected with them. For the good of the
public he stated that he believed it his
duty to put Dunbar where he could do
no harm.
John Smith, a pal of Dunbar's and
charged with the same offense, bur
glarizing a room In the Windsor Hotel,
withdrew a plea of not guilty and
pleaded guilty. He was represented by
Attorney Arthur Mack of San Fran
cisco, who asked that sentence be post
poned until next Monday.
While Dunbar is not yet 30, he has
already established a reputation for
himself as a crook and is known to
every policeman in ' San Francisco,*
where he has done most of his work.
He has seven prior convictions against
him, and his admission of two of them
in connection with the present charge
was responsible for the severity of the
sentence imposed upon him. |
The girl that fainted looked hardly
out of her teens and wept bitterly. Be
fore Dunbar can again enjoy his free
dom he will be an old man.
George Dunbar, a self-confessed bur
glar, was sentenced to twenty-five
years in j San Quentin this morning by
Judge Ogdeh. Upon hearing the sen
tence a young girl,- whose identity was
not disclosed but who was evidently in
terested in the young criminal, fainted
and had to be taken from the court
room. Dunbar himself gave no evidence
of unusual feeling in regard to the sen
tence. He did not see the girl. She re
fused to give her name or acknowledge
that she knew Dunbar.- A girl friend
who was with her,' however, said they
had come to see what "would be done
to him."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Nov. 16.
The addresses by the other players
were brief and referred mainly to the
work of the team in Saturday's contest.
Trainer Christie had something to say
about breaking the training rules and
appealed to the co-eds to help out in
the future.
Captain Overall was cheered when he
said the team had done its level best.
It was lucky and yet unlucky that the
team scored and was scored o gainst.
"The main thing," he said, "is to look
out for next year. We lose many of our
veterans. Stanford retains most of
hers. We must get a team together
that will beat them."
The varsity football men were given
a royal welcome at an Impromptu rally
this morning on the sward opposite
Harmon Gymnasium. Instead of the
regular Monday morning: drill the
"rooters," assisted by the "co-eds,"
"rooted" for the men who tried so hard
to bring back victory after last Satur
day's fight on the field. The "ifs" and
the "might have beens" were all
omitted, so that there would be more
room for the more encouraging words.
Yell Leader Philip Carey, perched
upon a box on the field, led the deep
throated and the shrill-piped. The
"oskl wows" were a little hutky, but
loud enough to be heard at Berkeley
station. Brief addresses were made by
Presldent Wheeler, Orva! Overall,
"Sam" Stow, "Little" Mini, Colonel
George C. Edwards, Walter Christie
and "Jack" Whipple.
"That was a good game Saturday,"
President Wheeler said. "The team
represented us and j, we are going to
stand by It. I have nothing to criticise
and no one should be allowed to criti
cise anything. I saw Stanford make
her first touchdown Saturday. And I
don't want to see her do It aeain. I
once saw California make a score of
30 to 0. I like 40 to 0 better. Let's
make it 40 to 0 next year.
"We have good material for a team
here next year. It grieves us to lose
a man like Overall. Not altogether be
cause he is a good football player, but
also because he Is a good man. We
will have to get somebody to fill his
place and the places of the others. We
can do it. We don't have to tave all
four-year men. A few good ones will
form the bulwark of the team and we
can develop others who will Improve
in time." â¢

BOSTON, Nov. 16.â Two spirited de
bates enlivened what would otherwise
have been a dull session at the conven
tion of the American Federation of La
bor at Faneuil Hall to-day. The first
was upon the question of whether the
federation should grant a charter to
the insurance agents of the country,
and after a somewhat acrimonious dis
cussion the matter was referred to the (
executive council. This was regarded i
by the delegates as a defeat of the j
l>lan to organize and charter insurance |
r. gents.
The second debate was upon the sub- '
Sect of industrial depression. It was
called forth by the report of the com
mittee on the president's report, in
dorsing the statement of President
(.Jumpers that a period of industrial de
pression was coming. Several delegates
expressed their opinion that no depres-
Fion was nrobable, but the Socialist
delegates insisted that the president's
forecast was true. They urged as a '
;Â»>sEible preventive not only organiza
tion on trades union lines but also the
formation of a political organization by
labor workers. ,
BOSTON. Â»W, 15.â Consideration of
resolutions was resumed to-day by the
convention of the American Federation
Â«<f Labor. The proposition to charter
the Insurance agents of the country a3
nn affiliated body was met by opposl
" tion on the ground that Insurance
toqr-nts were not wage earners and be
cause of the fear that the admission of
agents to membership might result in
.*n attempt to force insurance upon
pome of the members.
President Gompers, who took the
floor, expressed the belief that why
many unions were not well organized
was that they paid too much attention
to "this curse of insurance, which we
ere askr-d to indorse."
He declared that the trade union In
surance v.as what the union officials
should direct their attention to and for
that r<Â»asoÂ» alone he did not favor
granting charters to insurance men.
The matter was finally referred. to the
committee of the executive council.

DENVER, Nov. 16.â Contrary to the
expectation that prevailed on Saturday,
coal mining was not resumed In the
Northern Colorado coal field, the opera
tors' proposition to concede a nine-hour
day pending the result of the strike in
Southern Colorado having been rejected
by the miners. Information from the
southern field Is that neither the opera
tors nor the strikers show any signs of
weakening and a prolonged struggle is
now expected.
Because of the lack of coal, owing to
the miners' strike, the Rocky Mountain
Paper Company, has closed Its mills for
an indefinite period, throwing over 200
persons out of employment.
It Is possible that another conference
looking to, the settlement of the strike
In the Northern Colorado field will be
arranged in a few days. Both the op
erators and many of the miners were
disappointed at the failure to come to
an agreement on Saturday. The ma
jority against a settlement was so
small that it is believed that if It can
be arranged to have another ballot
taken those who. favor a settlement will
be In the. majority.

throughout the day and an attempt will
be made to-morrow to install a closer
schedule. Riots were frequent all along
the line, but the police charged on the
crowds with such quickness and force
that but one serious blockade w:Â» met
with. When the last of the twent>'-flve
cars that had been in the service
reached the barn at 4:30 o'clock this
evening It was decided to suspend fur
ther traffic until to-morrow morning.
The inquiry of the State Board of
Arbitration, asking that the difficulty
be submitted to arbitration, it. was an
nounced to-night, would be replied to
to-morrow by S. R. Bliss, counsel for
the company. The communication. It
is said, will agree to arbitration of the
wage Question only and will entirely
ignore the demands of the men that
the recognition of the union also be
submitted to the board. As the lat
ter clause in the demands of the men
has been the stumbling block all along
to a peaceable settlement of the trou
ble, it is said there Is little chance for
the present at least of a conciliatory
adjustment of the controversy.
an effort would be made to-morrow to
resume traffic on the Cottage Grove
avenue cable lines. The intention is to
start trains early In the morning and
unless too much opposition is met with
the service will be gradually increased
later In the day. Five hundred police
men will be added to-morrow to the
number already detailed to guard the
property of the company. This addi
tional force will be assigned to the Cot
tage Grove-avenue line, and the cars
will be run under the same protection
as those on Wentworth avenue. Screens
have been provided for the grip cars
to shield the gripmen and the trains
will be run at a high rate of speed In
an effort to prevent crowds from block
ing the tracks.

. The strikers are making much of an
attack on Mayor Harrison by Clarence
S. Darrow, who was one of the counsel
for the miners In the big anthracite
coal strike and who has been one of
Mayor Harrison's strongest supporters
politically. Darrow has declared that
if the ptreet car strikers are beaten
Mayor Harrison will be responsible by
reason of having authorized the ar
rangements whereby the police ride In
all the cars that are being operated.
According to Darrow, also, the Mayor
in conducting negotiations for a re
newal of the company's franchise
could, by a little pressure, promptly
force the company to arbitrate.

As part of the plan of the street rail
way men's union for a campaign of
education in the fight on the City
Railway, circulars were sent broad
cast to-day, dealing with the financial
features of the "richest street railway
corporation" in the country.
The body of the circular is an extract
from the Civic Federation's report on
the City Railway Company. The re
port says that In sixteen years the
company has earned 44 2-3 per cent on
the capital invested. The real value of
the company's property, . It says, is
$9,800,000. The market value Is $37,630,
000 and the original cost 512,948,000.
The State Board of Arbitration re
mained in continuous session, awaiting
a reply from the railway company re
garding the board's proffer of volun

compulsory investigation, which the
board is empowered to make. No word
was received, however, although -re

He claims that testimony showing
an advance in cost of living of 30 per
cent was unreliable, that this advance,
based on statistics of Professor Plehn
of the University of California of the
five months of 1903 over the correspond
ing months of 1902 was not more than
3 per cent and that this was more than
covered by the advance of 10.8 in wages
granted by the company In April, 1902.
"When it is admitted that the United
Railroads are already paying a high
rate of wages; that this rate "of wages
is higher than that paid for the same
service in the great cities in which liv
ing is more expensive than in San
Francisco, and that there is an abund
ance of labor in San Francisco seeking
employment at the present high rate
of waees, it seems to me there is no
ground, for further advancing the
wages."

Hart and Joe Choynski went six rounds
to a draw at the Washington Sporting
Club to-night. The bout was fast, both
men taking severe punishment and both
were bleeding freely at the close. The
t two fighters started out at a terrific
: pace, hitting right and left with telling
! effect. There was no perceptible dif-
I ference in the men during the first two
I rounds. In the third round Hart sent
Choynski to the floor with a terrific
punch on the Jaw. Choynski remained
on the floor until Referee Rocup count
ed eight and then rose to his feet and
came back vigorously at Hart, but the
latter managed to hold his own.
The men fought so hard in the first
three rounds that they came to the
center of the ring in the fourth look
ing very tired. As a consequence the
round was rather time. In the fifth,
however, they again went at each other
with terrific . smashes of rights and
lefts. In the sixth round Hart looked
a trifle fresher than Choynski. Hart
hit Choynski with his right and left
almost at will. The latter was weaken
ing rapidly and was a little groggy
until thirty seconds from the end of
the round, when he rallied. He rushed
at Hart and smashed him frequently
with his right. Hart, weakened by his
own exertions earlier in the round, was
unable to withstand Choynski's on
slaughts and the latter kept punching
him until the bell announced the end
of the fight.
Notwithstanding the amount of pun
ishment received neither man was bad
ly hurt. Hart's nose was bleeding and
also his mouth, while Choynski had a
Elight cut over the right eye.
Choynski appeared to be In better i
condition than Hart. The latter looked j
as though he weighed about fifteen
pounds more than his opponent.

WARM DEBATE
In thr marriage contract of Miss
Florence Bojnere and George W. Whit
ip!) Jr. there seems to have been a little
j--!:r. The New York statute In sec
tion 11 of the acts of 1901 of marriages
provides that a marriage may be made
by contract, provided the parties to the
contract eign It in the presence of two
witnesses, who must give their names
and residences. The contract must
have the same acknowledgments as a
deed to real property. The contract
must also be recorded within six
months from the time of execution.
In this case everything was done In
iUll retirement of the law but one.
Tn*s one was the failure to have the
contract recorded. Whether or not at
tne time the contract was entered Into
Miss Boyere was fully advised as to
this provision of law is not made clear,
but. at any rate, ghe became aware of
the fact a short time later and wanted
the contract placed on record. Whit
tell, however, persuaded her that it was
all right, and told her that if it was
recorded his father would discover the
fact and disinherit him.
Upon these statements she allowed
matters to stand as they were. The
pair came out to San Francisco in
March and all went well for a time.
Early In October Whittell. it is al
leged, went to his wife and asked her
to tear the contract up. This she em
phatically refused to do. He made the
Fame request many times thereafter,
but all met with the same response.
One night. It is reported, while ehe
was staying at the Lick House, he
went to her room very much under the
Influence of liquor In company with
some colored men and tried to throw
her out of bed and make her sleep on
the couch. She promptly ordered the
whole crowd out of her room. After
this matters were serene for a while.
About five w^eks ago Whittell took
himself and his automobile to the
southern part of the State and while
there was constantly in company with
other people. When this news came to
the ears of the contract wife she re
solved to take decisive steps. She could
8tand for a time being kept in the
background, and she could stand being '
xold that she could not go touring in
the BTrfft-flylng automobile through
the rosy paths of Pasadena and the
orar.jre groves of Santa Ana, because
Mr. Whitt?!l Sr. would "set on" to I
them and all r.ould be "off." This she
bore in meekness and silence until the
news came that another was occupying
the front -.eat in that speeding ma
chine.
This was too much and without fur
ther ado she Informed Whittell Sr. of
the true condition of affairs and of the
relationship she bore to his son. Then
came the great scene, which was fol
lowed by the annulJment of the mar
nape and the payment of a handsome j
sum which was to act as balm for her
broken heart and at the same time to ,'
rÂ»H*ve Whittell Sr. of a daughter-in

DRAW FOR HART
AND CHOYNSKI
At first the boy decided to keep the
satchel, but, probably discovering that
its contents were of no value, surren
dered it to the police last evening.
The contents show that the owner. Is
Edward Devillers, a wealthy Frenchman,
supposed to be on h*\s way to South Af
rica to lay claim to about 10,000 acres
of property in the Transvaal.
There were several passports, in Ger
man. French and English writing.
Among the contents of the bag was a
clipping from a newspaper of Alliance,
N. Y., that tells of Devillers having been
arrested in that town for being found
asleep in the doorway of a hotel. He
was held for a few days, after which he
was released. A letter bearing the sig
nature of Louise Commeford, New York
City, was also in the bag.
The police are in search of Devillers,
as they are anxious to learn more of the
man. who he is, how he came to San
Francisco and what he was here for.
The fact that the boy held the satchel
as long as he did will probably make
the chances of overtaking the man re
mote.
The bag was found by a youth named
William Sullivan, who does not remem
ber the exact date of his find, but thinks
that it was four or five days ago.
A small handbag found by a boy on
the corner of Oak Grove avenue and Bry
ant street and supposed to belong to one
Kdward Devillers promises to develop a
mystery for the police department to
solve.
APPOINTEES SET
THEIR POSITIONS
At that time Moracco paid little at
tention to the matter. He says he did
not realize its seriousness. Since then
other threats and letters have been re
ceived, but he remained firm in his de
termination to stay here. No attempt
was made on his life until last night,
when he was go-ing to his lodgings. He
was walking up Sansome street and
was about to turn into Broadway when
the men sprang upon him and adminis
tered the beating.
The police are of the opinion that the
enemies of the man are sincere in their
threats and believe the injured man's
story. Detective Taylor is of the
opinion that the men who made the at
tack did not intend to slay Moracco.
but desired to impress upon him the
fact that they meant business and to
force him to quit the city.
Luigi Moracco, who claims to be a
clerk residing at 410 Broadway, says he
is under the ban c-f the Mafia. His life
has been threatened and repeated warn
ings have been sent him to leave the
city. Last night he was badly beaten
with an iron bar by his enemies on San
some street, and the case has been
placed in the hands of the Detective
Department. .
Shortly before midnight Officer Rob
ert Silver found Moracco on Broadway,
badly cut on the head and face. The
injured man said an attack had been
made upon him by a number of men
and that an iron bar had been used as
a weapon. He was left bleeding and
almost unconscious on the sidewalk and
after his assailants had left the scene
he started for his lodgings. He states
that he knows one of his assailants and
will swear out a warrant for this man's
arrest this morning.
Detective Charles Taylor interviewed
the injured man at police headquarters
and a tale of the Mafia was unfolded to
him. Moracco says that he haa been in
the city but a short time and Is em
ployed as a clerk. Soon after his ar
rival he v.as suspected of being an
agent of the Italian Government and
the arm of the secret society reached
after him. On October 10 he recei\'ed a
letter warning him to leave the coast
and he . was threatened with death
should he disregard the cc-mmand. On
the paper was drawn, in crude fashion,
a skull and crossbones, a dagger, bomb,
cutlass and revolver.

Should you attempt to lead when too

you will probably lose your balance and

at his mercy. Or, if you step too close
you stand an excellent chance of re

The independence of the Dominion of Canada has been
predicted by one of the leading citizens of that interesting
colony of Great Britain.. And yet this buoyant pioneer of
a new state forgets that Canada was never more palpably
dependent, more pitiably in need of direction and counsel,
than when she protested in impotent vehemence against the
decision of a court in which she was a member and to
whose decision she was in honor pledged to "submit..
While all this preparation was go
ing on the keen minds of the managers
were not idle. The sharpest of detec
tives were employed to note the splen
dor of the ladies and an approximate
value of the diamonds, etc., worn by
the wives and sweethearts of the con
ductors. That the ball -was a great
success was the universal verdict of all
who attended.
Later the detectives' reports were
sent to headquarters and duly noted
Nothing was said by the foxy manage
ment for a month or so afterward
Then gradually conductor after con
ductor whose wife was more than or
dinarily resplendent at the ball found
a little note handed to him, with the
information 'that his services were no
longer required. In the opinion of the
managers an honest conductor, living
on the salary given him, could not af
ford to give his wife diamonds and
silks. This was the unpleasant sequel
of the first conductors' ball.
To arrive at this for a certainty and
without doing the honest men an in
justice, a notice was issued from the
superintendent's office stating that the
railroad management desired to show
its appreciation of the services render
ed by the conductors by giving a ball
in their honor at the Oakland mole.
This Invitation was cheerfully accepted
by the railroad men and as usual each
lady vied with her neighbor to appear
In the very finest of gowns and jewelry
to match.
In the early days when the "Big
Four" were in full control of the old
Central Pacific Railroad Company
conductors were suspected of "knocK
ing down" more ready money out of
the company than some of the stock
holders. The . Idea was therefore con
ceived by which to ferret out the men
who were living In luxury on their in
come thus illicitly derived from their

To demonstrate this he says: "The platforms might
have been exchanged without doing violence to the convic
tions of either party., They are pledged to the public
ownership of public utilities." Granted that they are, and
that the twins cannot be told apart, let us suppose the
vagaries of the joint platforms spread over the Union as the
national principles of the Popular Rights party, what re
ception will they meet? Mr. Hearst says: ''The Demo
cratic party has an unshakable hold on the South. With the
workingmen of the cities voting for the same candidates
the alliance will prove invincible."
Does he mean that the South will in the future show
the same appetite. for. vagaries that it had for those of Mr.
Bryan, and that it will go further and chew and swallow
those in the San Francisco: platform? If.so, we think he is
mistaken. States and sections in this country show an un
ceasing tendency to revert to former ideas and ideals in poli
tics. For a long time prior to the Civil War; the South
had a strong affinity for the Whig party.' In 1840 the
Whigs carried eight of the Southern States, and 1848 again
took a majority of -"them for Taylor, the last Whig Presi
dent. In 1852 the Whig party was moribund and Pierce's
ideas on the slavery question won the South away from an
organization that had lost its grip. .But- whether Whig or
Democratic, there is nothing in the economic situation or
political ideals "of the. South to warrant the conclusion that
it will in national convention support the platform of new'
principles hewed out for Mr. Hearst's Popular Rights .party
as the successor to the Democracy.
Every Southern leader, from Jefferson to Jefferson Davis,
has expressly repudiated Mr. Hearst's ideas of government
as expressed for him in the_ local platforms which he ad
mires so much. It is to think meanly of^the South. to. con r
elude that her people will -now surrender long held convic-
THERE will be no lack of literature between now and
next year's Presidential elections on the subject of a
new Democratic fusion. "It is Mr. Hearst's business
to manufacture and put that literature on the market. His
several newspapers have determined to make San Fran
cisco the basis of the argument in that behalf, and to make
a statement of political conditions here which, if spread as
a sort of veneer all over the country, will make the election
of a fusion candidate sure, provided the Democratic and
labor union parties cuddle in the same camp.\
Starting with an artificial figure of 25,000 as the Repub
lican vote of San Francisco, with a Democratic vote of
14,034 and a Labor party vote of 15,205, Mr. Hearst is able
to show a fusion majority here of 3724. To make fusion
fuse, and to extend his new Democratic party on that basis
all over the United States, he calls the fused organization
the Popular Rights party, and argues, at great length and
little breadth, to show that Labor . Union party and Demo
cratic principles, as stated in the city platforms, are iden
tical. . . \

So much for the history of footwork â
a history that has transformed boxing
from a mere slugging exhibition into
one of the most graceful cf athletic
accomplishments.
Now get your gloves on p.nd let us
practice this new branch of our art.
Though to-day your feet will do more
work than your hands. Moreover, to
day's lesson will teach you cne of the
most important things a boxer has to
learnâ namely, how to gauge distance.
Stand on guard. Lead for your spar
ring partner's face with the left (after
first going over all the various blows,
counters, euards, etc.. that you have
thus far learned. Remember to begin
each lesson with a review of all oast
work.)
Lead for his face with your left, as
I have said. Now, as you bring back
your left arm to the first positjon. step
backward at the same time with the
right foot, bringing the left foot after
ward, so that when the left foot touches
ground you will be standing again on
guard, feet eighteen inches apart as
usual, but a step farther away from
your opponent than you were. Repeat
this until you can make this backward
step quickly after delivering the blow,
and can do so without losing your bal
ance or making a misstep or falling to
fall into correct position as you swiftly
brine back the left foot to its correct
place in front of the right.
his whereabouts, by keeping in con
stant motion and by stepping in to
strike and stepping out to avoid re
prisals, harder blows could be struck
and much punishment avoided.
For years footwork gradually gained
gTound. At last Jim Corbett. the clev
erest boxer the world has yet seen,
brought it to perfection.
JThe Secretary went on to point out that under, the
terms of the merchant marine bill introduced last winter it
was specifically provided that the subsidies granted by the
bill to American shipping should never exceed $9,000,000 in
any one year, while we annually pay $200,000,000 to foreign
subsidized ships to get our foreign commerce carried across
the seas.
The facts thus stated by Secretary Shaw were not new to
the people of Boston. They have been well known for a
long time. In fact the voters of the country have again
and again given them due consideration and voted upon
them, casting a heavy vote in favor of the desired legisla
tion. Argument before the people is therefore hardly neces
sary any further. The issue now is to get Congress to
obey the will of the people and enact the required laws.
It is not too much to expect the passage of a well devised
bill during the coming winter, and the industrial and com
mercial bodies of the country should not hesitate to" de
mand it. *
WITH the assembling of Congress there will natur
ally be a revival of popular interest in the much
discussed question of promoting American com
merce by wel! devised legislation in favor of upbuilding an
adequate American merchant marine. The issue was made
one of special note in several States during the recent cam
paigns, and in Ohio the contest against Senator Hanna was
made almost wholly one of opposition to what the Demo
crats; called "the ship subsidy bill." 'Wherever this issue
was squarely made victory rested with the Republican party,
and it is therefore fair to say that the country has virtually
once more declared in favor of protecting American indus
try on the ocean as well as on land.
Shortly before the election Secretary Shaw in an address
at Boston said: "We are securing only 10 per cent of the
trade of South America, of South Africa and of the countries
washed by the Pacific Ocean. This trade is worth more than
$1,000,000,000 per annum. We get. 10 per cent of it. Other
countries secure the balance. Why? They are ready to pay
the price. They avail themselves of every natural advantage
and pay the price of others. They have and we do not
have direct and regular steamship communication with
these countries. I was recently told by a man who ought
to know that William Deering obtained an order for $100,
000 worth of implements to go to South America by acci
dentally finding in some of our Eastern ports a tramp
steamer going direct to the point of destination. Other
wise he would have been compelled, to ship first to Europe,
thence to South America, and then it would have been too
late."

In the summer of 1S96 the great gold
deposits on the Klondike creeks were
discovered, and when the news reached
England, twelve months afterward, no
one knew where they were. Was the
Klondike In British Columbia or Alas
ka? Nobody thought of the Northwest
Territories, little knowing that they
stretched far beyond the northern
range of the Rocky Mountains. Within
a couple of years Yukon, on account of
its remoteness andJnaccesslbillty. was
taken out of the jurisdiction of the
Territorial Government and created a
separate territory, under a Commis
sioner and Council, and now the force
of police is 290 strong, with detach
ments throuzhout the whole basin of
the Upper Yukon.
The work of the police Is of endless
variety. It will perhaps be remembered
that a story of a Russian boundary
monument in the disputed Territory
was reported in the course of the last
year. A party from the Dalton Trail
post was dispatched to examine into
this, with Assistant Surgeon Fraser In
charge. Mr. Fraser reported that about
three miles past Mount Glave the horse
trail crosses a tributary of the Clear
Creek, and about 100 yards up from
this stones are piled up t^o make a shel
ter to be U3ed by Indians while storm
bound crossing the summit. This pile
constituted the alleged monument and
consisted of a larse flat stone, about
four feet bv three feet, and a few
inches thick, raise! at an angle of
forty-five degrees from the ground, and
supported in this position by another
smaller stone, the two forming a rude
shelter.
Seven years ago the sole representa
tives of authority on the Upper Yukon
were a detachment of twenty North
west Mounted Police, under Major
Constantine, sent up by the Canadian
Government to maintain law and order
as best thev could, says the London
Times. They built a post at Fort
Cudahy on the Tukon, twenty-five
mlldfc on our side of Alaska, near the
mining: town of Forty Mile. Gold dig
ging had been going on there for ten
years before, but Englishmen had
heard nothing . of it and would only
have smiled if they had. The Dominion
Government thus took actual posses
sion of the srold country, which was
supplied entirely by United States
trading companies, working up from
the Behrlng Sea.

Water was below that red horizon.
The tottering limbs refused to carry
the anguished body farther. He sat
down upon the heap of sand and, bury

rising of another sun and with it the

The third day the cries for water be
came more and more feeble. The gaunt
man who was sitting there in the grill
ing heat, fanning the insects from the
brow of the figure on the sand, was
swaying from weakness, for he had
taken none of the precious water which

Converse County, Wyoming, is fearful that it will be forced

The extent to which strata of later
times have been folded up and piled
upon each other is almost incredible.
Professor Claypole measured the strata
In the Alleghany Mountains across
Huntingdon, Junlata and Perry
counties. In Pennsylvania, < and found
that where they were originally spread
out on the ocean bottom to a distance
of 100 miles they had been wrinkled
and folded arid crushed together, until
they were compressed within sixty-five
miles. Professor Helm of Zurich esti
mates that the folding up of the Alps
resulted in the compression of about
seventy-four miles; that is. if the Alps
were flattened out again, as you would
flatten out the wrinkles In cloth, two
points on the opposite s sides of the Alps
would be seventy-four miles farther
away from each other than they are
now. In many cases in the Alps, and
indeed in the Appalachian Mountains,
the superficial sedimentary strata
have been folded over, so that what Is
now the top was formerly the* bottom.
Now the generally acepted theory
concerning the earth's history is that
it wag originally a molton globe, -which
has slowly cooled down, allowing a
crust to form over* the surface, which
has gradually thickened in proportion
as the earth cooled. This crust is
therefore much thicker in the later
geological periods than it was in the
earlier. As a consequence the geolo
gists point out that the inevitable ten
dency would be for the later wrinkles
to be ampler than the earlier ones- for
In the Earlier geological ages, when the
crust was comparatively thin, It could
not sustain itself in so high an eleva
tion as would be possible when it had
thickened up in later ages. It Is there
fore believed that in the earlier geolo
gical ages the mountains were never so
high as they were in later geological
periods. The thinner and 8of ter strata
pt the earlier geological period would
break up and mash together where the
later ones would swell up and be folded
over. -~- .
Two causes may be assigned to this
greater height of the younger moun
tains, one of whic^i Is connected with
the general theory of mountain build
ing, and the other with the agencies
which are constantly wearing the
mountains down and carrying them
back into the sea.
â¢ â¢ â¢
As the Andes, the Rocky Mountains,
the Alps, the Caucasus and the moun
tains of Central and Southern Asia in
clude by far the highest mountains of
the world, the proposition announced
at the beginning of this article is suffi
ciently proved. At the same time the
age of these loftiest mountains is strik
ingly In contrast with that of various
older mountain chains. What we call
the Highlands of Carada, surrounding
Hudson Bay, are composed of the old
est rocks of the world, but they no
where rise to a height of more than
2000 or 3000 feet. The Alleghany Moun
tains, likewise, though younger than
the Highlands of Canada, are much
older than the Rocky Mountains, but
they are not half as high. In Europe
the Scandinavian and Ural Mountains
are very old, and likewise comparative
ly low, nowhere rising more than one
third the height of the Alps, or one
flfth of the height of the mountains in
Central Asia.
One hundred and fifty years ago the
occurrence of these shells in the rocks
on high Alpine elevations were taken
as evidence of the flood, and Voltaire
knew of no way to discredit the evi
dence, except to deny its truth. He,
therefore, resorted to the suggestion
that the shells found at these high ele
vations had been carried there by pil
grims and carelessly thrown away. But
Voltaire was no geologist, or he would
have disproved the theory of the flood
by a better argument, for these shells
are found as constituent elements of
great thicknesses of rock, entirely be
yond the capacity of so temporary a
submersion as the deluge is reported to
have been. .
Rocks of similar age, with their /In
cluded recent forms of oceanic life, are
found upon the flanks of the Caucasus
Mountains at an eijual height, and in
Thibet and in the Himalaya Moun
tains, at an elevation of 13,000 or 14,000
feet.
All the highest mountains are young
mountain?. This is proved by the fact
that, high up upon their shoulders,
they bear sedimentary rocks of the lat
est geological period, namely, the ter
tiary. Where now we behold the great
mountain systems of America, Europe
and Asia, the waters of a shallow sea
prevailed during the middle of the ter
tiary period. West of the Mississippi
River the dry land was limited to the
narrow axis of the Rocky Mountain
chain, to an elevated plateau now oc
cupied by the great basin of which
Utah is the center, and to detached ele
vations along the line of the Sierra Ne
vada Mountains bordering the Pacific
Ocean. Since that time this vast area
has been lifted up out of the sea, car
rying the sedimentary rocks then
formed with their abundant sea shells
to a height of several thousand feet
and lifting the original mountain peaks
to a correspondingly greater height.

A READER.
San Francisco, Nov. 16.
THE California Miners' Association is in session in this
city, and the numbers in attendance and the subjects
discussed will convince the country that mining is not
played out in California. The association probably
tains and represents more expert miners and a greater va
riety of mines and deposits of the precious metals and -use
ful minerals than any other organization from a similar area
in the world. Kiniberley has diamonds' and the Rand has
gold. But California has such a variety of mineral de
posits and in them such a large aggregate of potential
wealth as to make her the leading mining region of the
ear*h.
There is ahe subject that the Miners' Association should
consider. Among our mineral riches are the finest of build
ing stones. Our granites-'arc unexcelled in appearance, and
in all the qualities of a first-class material/ Our marbles
rank any other in the United States, and our onyx, for in
side finish, is "the equal of the Mexican, whfch leads the
world. Under these circumstances the many public build
ings. Federal and other,- that are being and td be erected
in the State, should be built of domestic material. Yet the
new Oakland postoffice is built, we believe, of stone from
Utah, and we understand that for some reason, that surely
is not found in the lack of quantity or quality in our home
material, other public buildings are of foreign material.
This subject requires attention. The mining of building
stones is an important branch. It employs labor, and the
use of our domestic material stimulates the search for new
deposits. The convention will serve a great interest if it
will suggest to our members of Congress that they secure
the right of way for California stone in the construction of
Federal buildings. â¢
Another mineral interest that is making rapid progress
is the manufacture of hydraulic cement. This has been at
tempted in other States, but nowhere else with the success
achieved here. Our domestic cement is now being Â¦ used
in concrete works, in sidewalks, curbs and in reservoirs and
other submerged structures. The Government is installing
irrigation works throughout the arid region, requiring the
use of an enormous quantity of cement. As the tariff on
Portland cement, imported from Belgium, is for the pur
pose of encouraging the manufacture of the domestic ar
ticle, and California produces the equal of the imported,
it should surely be the policy of the Government to use
our cement in its own work. We are informed that the
preference so far has been given to imported cement, while
it is officially admitted that ours is as good. This should
be inquired into. Perhaps millions of tons of cement must
be used in irrigation work. What is the use of sending em
bassies abroad to look for foreign consumption of our
products if we shut out a domestic demand by meeting it
with an imported supply?
The precious metals make their own markets. They
need no protection and no effort. But the useful materials
of the State, vast in their potential supply and practically
inexhaustible, need the intelligent attention of this asso
ciation, that stands for the mineral interests of California.
Recently we have added oil to our stock of valuable
mineral substances. This association should promote; the
use of our oil. \Ve have iron of excellent quality in forty
one counties. Some of it is very convenient to the coast
and near the oil regions. If our oil can be used as a
smelting fuel California can speedily have a large iron pro
duction. We have the ore and the flux, everything but the
coal for smelting. If an oil flame can be diffused through a
cupola we will be independent as to our iron and steel.
T*he convention will doubtless consider all that pertains
to the mineral interests of the State, and these subjects
should be objects of its deliberation.

tions as to the nature and -purpose of government for the
sake of such analliance as Mr. Hearst proposes with class
elements in the great cities of the North.
In 1896 the South did suffer an aberration on the finan
cial question and followed Mr. Bryan, against the protect of
Bayarjd, Gray, Caffery, Patterson, Jones and scores of leaders
who knew the right and abided with it. But it must be ad
mitted that the impulse'of that aberration had some excuse.
The South was poor. Faulty finance' and imperfect-distri
bution of money made interest high and obsoleted much of
the collateral that the South had to 'offer for loans. When
the people were told that these conditions were caused by
a scarcity of money, it is not to be wondered at that they
seized upon Mr. Bryan's . quantitative theory! and followed
it into the campaign.
By 1900 the South was clothed and in her right mind
on the money question,; and in the Kansas City convention
opposed all the financial theories she had adopted four years
before. . But suppose that she accept, next year, the two
platforms proposed by Mr. Hearst and enter the alliance he
seeks to make, what then?. That will be done on the same
theory as the fusions of 1896 and 1900, and will be made
upon an incorrect statement of the facts. In 1900 Mr. Mc-
Kinley had 35,000 votes to 25,000 for Bryan in San Fran
cisco. That is about the strength of the two political ideas
in this city. The recent vote for Mayor Schmitz had
in it an element that is Republican in national elections.
It supported him for various reasons, not the least being
his tactful statement that as Mayor he had settled labor
difficulties without strikes and violence, and if re-elected
would have the power to do so in the future.
With Mr. Hearst's proposed alliance made and with
him as the candidate, there is every reason to believe that
Roosevelt's vote here will exceed McKinley's by not less
than 5000, and that his majority in the State will go to
75,000. This is not a Republican, opinion of the situation
exclusively, for it is concurred in by shrewd Democratic
politicians all over the State. The weakness of all political
fusions is their extremely artificial nature. The followers of
Lane and Schmitz in this city cannot be voted by agreement.
Nor can the members of any political party be allotted by
its leaders. Republicans will highly approve Mr. Hearst's
fusion and hope to see him the hybrid candidate.

Investigating Shaughnessy's Death.
Detectives O'Dea and Mulcahey have

ing the death of John Shaughnessy, an
efx-convict, on/ Sunday. An autopsy
was made on 'the body by Dr. Baci

death was probably due to congestion
of the lungs. As it was claimed that
Shaughnessy said he had been drugged
in a house on Grant avenue the stom

In the official count now going on of
the recent election Hocks now leads
Loughery by five votes. There is a pos
sibility that he may gain two more
votes, as in the returns of the Sixth
Precinct of the Thirty-ninth Assembly
District there appears to be a dis
crepancy. One of the tally sheets of
this precinct gives a total vote of sixty
six votes, while another gives a total
of sixty-four vote's. This difference
was to Loughery's credit. The board
of this precinct will meet this morn

how the error occurred and how the
discrepancy of two votes crept in. The

The officer was not satisfied with
Reed's explanation and detained him

denied knowing Reed and on looking
over the premises a box of cigars and
two bottles of whisky were found

Desmond asked Reed what he was

'"Simard deserted ail right, but for
that matter men desert from the army
every day. It Is true that he did take
with him certain Government property,
but there is no doubt at>out his being
captured, as a searching party has al
ready started out after him. An en
listed man In the electrical department
is, as a rule, a few degrees higher than
the general run of enlisted men and
this man was treated as his position
warranted. He had his own little home
on the island, and, so far as I knew,
was a straightforward and honest
man."
Henry Elm&rd, sergeant in the de
partment of electricity, in charge of
the United States torpedo station on
Goat Island, deserted a week ago last
Saturday after having consummated
the theft of 158,400 feet, or Just thirty
miles, of copper wire belonging to the
Government, utilizing a tug for the
purpose. The wire, which traa valued
at about J5000 and weighed in the
neighborhood of three tens, was to have
been laid in the entrance of the harbor
within the next few months.
Simard has been in charge of the
Ftation for nearly a year, and up to
the time of his desertion his r?curd was
pood. Captain Overton, commanding
the electrical department of the station, j
was on eick leave at the time of the
desertion ar.d Lieutenant Charles E.
Urigham was substituted to take the
command.
Captain Overton, who returned to
duty a few days ago, made the follow- '
Ir.g statement yesterday morning re
parding Milliard's desertion and colossal
theft:
"I have just heard of the affair and
am greatly surprised, as I had always !
EurjKised Simard to be a man of ex
treme honesty. Of course, as I was j
away at the time I have nothing to
ray officially in regard to the matter.
Mr. Brigham was in charge during my
absence and he doubtless is acquainted
with the particulars of the case. Should
there be an investigation I do not see
bow I can be held responsible."
Lieutenant Brigham stoutly denies â¢
that the wire is missing at a!!, but ad
raits that Simard deserted, taking cer
tain Government property with him.
He will not specify either the nature or
the value of the property taken.
There remains no doubt, however,
that Simard did get away with the
plunder. It is the general supposition
that Simard procured the services of
a tug, v.hich landed its burd?n en shore
inside the bay. The different iron works
have been communicated with, but as
yet no clew to the whereabouts of the
missir.g wire has been discovered-
Lieutenant Brigham seems consid
erably upset over the affair, regarding
which he said: â¢

The contractor and owner were un
able to account for the sudden giving
way of the wall, but it is most likely
that the workmen undermined it.
The horses harnessed to the wagon
that was being â¢ utilized for hauling
away the excavated material were res
cued from their perilous position with
difficulty. Work will be delayed on the
site until the house at 657 Howard

J. A. O'Brien, a, contractor, was di
recting the work of excavating the lot
for a new building. Both the lot and
house next to it are owned by A.
Gness of 401 Fourth street. There was
no one livinc in the basement of the
house that collapsed, but the upper
stories were .occupied by Mrs. E. J.
Lanzill. The inmates of the house fled
Into the street terror stricken when the
structure began to topple. A portion
of the brick wall in front remained in
tact and that was all that saved the
whole building from falling into the
excavation.
Several workmen excavating /l lot for
a new building at 653 Haward street
had a narrow escape from death yes
terday afternoon. A 21-inch brick wall
supporting a frame house at 657 How

excavation, suddenly crumbled and fell
with a crash, 'burying a wagon and
half covering one of the horses with
debris. The workmen saw the heavy

While the child's parents are dis
tracted with grief over the awful fate
of their first-born, they do not attach
blame to Miss Stafford or any one else
connected with the hospital. The
father stated yesterday that he will
reserve his opinion until all the facts
are brought out at the inquest to-day.
Miss Stafford has been In the Chil
dren's Hospital about seven months,
and prior to coming there had served
nine months as nurse In a hospital at
Boulder, Colo. She Is very highly
spoken of by the Children's Hospital
medical staff and . Superintendent of
Nurses Brown, all of whom are at a
loss to explain Just how the fire orig
inated.
The kettle contained a quart of water,
half a teaspoonful of turpentine, five
drops of earbolic acid and five drops of
oil of eucalyptus. It was at first
thought that the kettle had exploded,
but that theory does not account for
the blaze, as turpentine was the only
combustible ingredient in the kettle,
and its proportion was so small as to
preclude possibility of the vapor catch
ing fire. A more reasonable hypothesis
Is that the flame of the Ptove was
wafted to the "croup screen" by the
draft made by the nurse opening and
closing the door when she went to the
telephone. An inexplicable phase of the
matter was the melting of the solder
at a joint of the tin pipe, several feet
above the stove.
The fire was caused in some way by
a defective apparatus used for giving
pneumonia patients inhalations of med
icated steam to accelerate thvir breath
ing. The contrivance consists of an
ordinary kettle, heated by a cas stove
placed upon a chair at tne head of the
cot. Attached to the orifice of the ket
tle is a tin pipe, -which conveys the
steam to the interior of a "croup
screen" surrounding the bed. This de
vice is used In most hospitals and at
the Children's Hospital the first acci
dent recorded against it resulted in the
death of Baby Powell.
Albert Powell, the father of the little
victim, is a racetrack follower, and
about a week ago he came here from
Los Angeles with his wife and baby
and took apartments at trie Winchester
House, on Third street. The little one
contracted a cold, and on Thursday her
condition was so serious that the phy
sician in attendance had her sent to
the Children's Hospital. Saturday
night her temperature was 104 degrees
and her breathing very labored, and
Sunday morning her, cot was inclosed
by the "croup screen" and the medi
cated steam administered almost with
out intermission until 9:45 o'clock p. m.,
when the nurse was called away and
the fatal accident happened.
PLAUSIBLE THEOBY.
Miss Ethel Stafford, the nurse who
had charge of the case, was called from
the chamber to answer a telephonic In
quiry from the little patient's parents,
and . when she returned, about three
minutes later, a "croup, screen" en
vironing the cot upon which the little
one lay was in flames and the coverlet
was also ablaze. Hastily plucking the
child from the burning couch the nurse
found that its garment was smoldering
and she quickly wrapped it In a quilt
and then summoned help. Dr. Emma
K. Willits and Superintendent of
Nurses Catharine Brown promptly re
sponded and, labored to alleyiate the
baby's sufferings. Fifteen minutes later
the child was dead.

The coast territory of the combine is
to extend as far east as Colorado and
is expected to control the powder trade
of this section of the United States.
Plans for enlarging a number of the
mills have been made already, and par
ticularly for supplying the demand of
the United States Government for
smokeless powder, for which the Du
pont Company has a contract.
Shortly after his arrival here yester
day Penniman started for the interior
with a view of thoroughly inspecting
the various local properties that have
been recently acquired by the combine.
He expects* to return to the city in
about three days. Â«
R. S. Pennlsonand James L. Hurd of
Dover, representing the Dupont Pow
der Company combine, arrived from
the East yesterday and are staying at
the Palace. They have come West to
take over the several powder compa
nies on this coast which were recently
merged into the Dupont combine and
will enter upon their duties to-day.
It was stated last evening that Pen
niman is to assume charge of the coast
Interests, which include all the powder
mills in' this State except that of the
Giant Company, which refused to en
ter the combine. His arrival here was
followed by considerable speculation as
to whether changes are to be made in
the management of the local concerns,
especially the California Company's
mills, at the head of which is John
Bermingham, his son and J. F. Nes
mith. The report Is that there Is to be
a centralization of management with
its headquarters in this city and that
this move will result in the lopping off
of heads among the higher officials of
the different companies. ,

Judge Fritz deemed it wise, to have her

Commissioners on Lunacy. Conse

the hall waiting for news from her
father that the amount of the bond had
been raised. Occasionally she would
pay a visit to. the Jail and with as brave
a manner as she could summon would
assure her mother In Italian of the cer

Burns the hospitality of his room at 66

races, but he is willing- to gamble on
anything. Wherefore he concluded to
gamble with his benefactor. He bet
himself that he could beat Tyler wak

Thomas F. Keating told a tale of love
militant to Judge Mogan yesterday. He
had been arrested. on complaint of Liz
zie Farrell for battery. The alleged
battery occurred in a lodging-house at
Fifth and Folsom streets Sunday night.
Thomas told the Judge that Lizzie was
'â¢his rag." "I love the goil, Judge," he
said, "and 1 never meant to hurt her.
I'm goin' to marry her." Further de
posing, he told how he found her at the
head of the stairs in the lodging-house
"getting gay" with his hated rival.
Then he threw her downstairs and
went down and tried to throw her up
again, but the burden was too heavy.
So after Lizzie had been bounced
around some she landed in the matron
ly bosom of the landlady, who drove
the strenuous lover (forth into the
street. All this Keating told the Judge,
who reproved him strongly for hi3
manner of wooing and found him guilty
of battery. He will be assessed some
corrective amount to-morrow morning.
Captain John Spillane and Policeman
J. J. Conlan were riding up Third street
Sunday afternoon, marveling at the
beauty of the~day and the peace and
quietude of the district south of the
slot. Suddenly in the vicinity of How

two officers fell off the car and rushed
into what appeared to be a Panama
revolution on a large scale. Out of a
multitude of arms going like flails they
dragged Tommy Snailham, a putative
prizefighter, and a newsboy named
Armstrong, who had got so badly
tangled up with his opponent that he
couldn't let loose. Both of them were
taken to the Southern ttation, where
it was found that Snailham had suf
fered a broken finger. Both Armstrong
and the prizefighter appeared before
Judge Mogan yesterday. "He tried to
cave in me nut wid a cobble stone.

Before the strong arm of the law

him to desist he insisted on punching
the guardian of the law with the re
sult that the windows of his scul were
shattered some when he appeared be
fore Judge Mogan yesterday. The ar
resting officer said that the cattle man
had paid for all the damage he had
done. He was penitent and pleaded with
the Judge to let him go back again to
his cattle range, where windows are
not and destructive concoctions are re
placed by pure mountain streams.
After a lecture on the perils of going
astray in a large city Edward was ad
vised to catch the first train back to
the range and then released.
the fog made him shudder and
shiver. For two days he fought against
the unpleasant weather and- then he
stole a stove. It was only a. little gas
heater, valued at $2 50, and the owner
thereof was John Day. However, the
predatory instincts of the fTerkeley
gentleman were aroused and he went
on his way searching for some isolated
gas works that ' he might purloin to
supply fuel for his stolen acquisition.
Before he located the gas works the
police located him and he appeared be

accuses of circulating charges detri
mental to her character. Wheeler has

Alfredo /Goling and Pedro Revers
were held in $2000 bonds yesterday by

glary. Sunday. morning they forced an
entrance to a jewelry store at 512
Broadway. Revers stood on the out
side to guard against surprises and his
companion entered the store and began
to ransack the premises. Before the
pair secured any plunder they were
surprised by Corporal Fraher and Po
licemen Holmes and Silver, who are
usually to' be found whenever a crim
inal is plying his trade on the Barbary
Coast. The intruders offered no ex

Jewelry store and will have to answer
to the charge of burglary in the Su

Because they needed the money,
John H. Gilmore. alias Morgan, and
Michael Ryan, alias Golden, two typi

Adolph Miller on Sacramento street
Wednesday night until h\was helpless.
They abstracted a $5 gold piece from
his pocket and also took his new derby
hat. As they fled up the street they
plumped into the arms of a couple of
burly policemen, who put them in a
place where wallops are barred. Thence
they came before Judge Conlan yester

bound over in the sum of $2000 each
to answer to the Superior Court for
their rigorous treatment of the home
ward bound waiter.
Conrad Keith, an aged street sweeper,
who is said to have in bank upward of

in Judge Conlan's court yesterday and
will be sentenced Thursday. He was
arrested several days ago by Detectives
Taylor and Ryan because he had pur
chased a clock from a man who had
stolen it. The police say that the aged
sweeper had been in the habit of re
ceiving stolen property and disposing
of it. Despite the wealth that Keith
is possessed of, he refused to bail him
self out and lay in Jail during the time
his case was under consideration.
Neither would he hire an attorney. He
asserts that if a fine is imposed he will
serve the time out rather than part
with any of his money. He is one of
the strange, miserly characters of a
great city and counts no cost too great
to retain his gold and no method too
unworthy to win it.
George T. Querbock. charged with the

The further hearing of the case was

Querbock is accused of kicking his af
flanced wife to death and cutting her
wedding garments into shreds in a
jealous rage. The autopsy surgeon
stated in his report that the woman
had died of fatty degeneration of the
heart. The mutilated clothes and the
fact that Querbock had gone into hid

body aroused the suspicion of the po

spending a week In jail under a bond
so high .that his friends could not lib
erate him, Judge Cabaniss fined him
$40 yesterday, which amount was paid
into the citv treasury after some of
the accused man's friends had spent
several hours raising the money. Levy
was accused of having approached the
Misses Angela and Alvenlsa Satoris,
aged 18 and 16 years, who live with
their parents at 1641 Howard street,
and. seizing the elder one by the arm,
made an indecent proposal to them.
The sirls testified that they tried to
avoid him, but he followed them to a
musiti studio on Geary street. They
informed the DKifessor of Levy's ob
jectionable attentions. The professor
summoned a policeman, who arrested
the "masher" in a nearby restaurant.
The defendant had a number of wit
nesses to testify to his former good
character, and in view of the fact that
he had already spent a week in Jail
Judge Cabaniss leniently fixed the fine
at $40. This punishment will probably
be sufficient to hold Levy for a while
and will serve a necessary warning to
a large class of objectionable men who
make it unsafe for women to walk the
streets unescorted.

marriage to W. Bayard Cutting at All
balnts Church, Ennismoor Garden,
London, in April, 1901, was one of the
greatest social events of the English
metropolis that season and attracted
widespread interest, especially in that
it was one of the few occasions on rec

position and wealth was enabled to at
tain an enviable position in London so
ciety After a prolonged honeymoon
on the eastern continent the young
couple Journeyed over to this side
where society feted them for aeveral
months.
Although the bride of young-Cutting
had always been accustomed to belmr
addressed as "lady" in her own coun
try she hafl hardly set foot on Ameri
can soil before she discarded her title
and thereafter insisted that she should
be known only as "Mrs." Cutting, the
wife of an American who possessed no
titles and wanted none. Frequently,
when former friends and associates of
her girlhood days have crossed the
Atlantic and greeted her as Lady Sybil
Mrs. Cutting quietly admonished, them

Returning from Europe young Cut
ting entered the- office of his father and
has since become one of the in^mbers
of the bis firm. With the senior Cut
ting he is largely interested in beet
sugar lands, a number of which are
located in this State, and It was a de
sire to inspect, these 'properties that
prompted his trip to the coast at this
time of the year. -The Cuttings expect
to remain here for several days and
will then make a tour of f the interior of
the State. ' - , ,
W. Bayard Cutting Jr., son of one of
New York's beet sugar magnates and

Chief of- Police Wittman is making
an effort to enforce the ordinance of
the Board of Supervisors relative to
the speed of automobiles v.ithin the
fire limits, owing to the fact that the
chauffeurs insist upon racing their ma
chines on Market street in violation of
the measure, which provides that the
maximum speed shall not exceed eight
miles an hour and half that spef d over
street crossings, that the lives of pedes
trains who seek to cross the crowded
thoroughfare, may not be Jeopardized.
Acting under instructions from Chief
Wittman, Captain Spillane " of the
Southern station detailed Patrolmen T.
P. Kinch and A. F. McPhee Jast night
to arrest all who violated the provisions
of the ordinance. H. M. Holbrook,
treasurer of the firm of Holbrook, Mer
rill & Stetson, was the first automo
blllst to come to grief, but was soon
followed by Ralph D. Merrill, son of
J. F. Merrill of the same firm, and H.
J. Kaufman, manager of the â¢ Bothin
Real Estate Company.
The three gentlemen were endeavor
ing to break Barney OldfieldV records
on Market street when overhauled by
the vigilant officers. The trio were
taken to the Hall of Justice and booked
on charges of violating bill 1068, ordi
nance 898, of the Board of Supervisors.
They were subsequently released upon
the deposit of $10 cash bail each.
The ordinance under which they- were
arrested was passed June 22 of this
year and was immediately signed by
the Mayor. In addition to the provis
ions relative to the speed the order
provides that upon approaching a
crossing a signal must be giwn to warn
pedestrians. A violation of ; the ordi
nance is punishable by a fine, not to
exceed $500 or by imprisonment in the
County Jail not to exceed six months
or by both such fine and Imprisonment.
It is anticipated that the arrests made
will have a salutary effect upon those
enthusiastic chauffeurs who make no
distinction between the racetrack and
Market street. >*â¢-.-

The particular sums paid under pro
test are respectively $8070 and $5449 76,
being the taxes charged to the bank on
these two accounts. It is also claimed by
the bank that the State Board of Equali

the value of the franchise or to add to
the assessor's valuation of the franchise.
The Bank of California paid its taxes
yesterday and at the same time filed a
protest with the City and County Tax
Collector against the payment of that
portion of taxes charged on account of
its franchise. The bank objects to the
assessment of $750,000 on the franchise
made by Assessor Dodge, and also ob

Green Line, the Billings entry, had
shown a mile In 2:05 only a few days
prior to the race. H. K. Deveroux of
Cleveland is considered one of the most
skillful amateur reinsmen in the coun
try, and when he volunteered to drive
Clipper the offer was quickly accepted.
The heats were intensely exciting and
the following paragraph taken from an
Eastern exchange gives a brief review
of the contest: After scoring twice to
an even start the word "go" was given.
As Clipper reached the quarter-mile
pole his nose was in tront, and from
there on he came along easily, finishing
the mile in 2:06%. The next heat was
a repetition of the former, Clipper win
ning, again in 2:06%, which made him

* Britt and Canole will. fight at Colma
next Friday night. The club. has ar

night of the scrap.
- Â¦ To-night Â¦ Jack - Cordell and Aurilio
Herrera will/; battle fifteen rounds be
fore the Reliance Athletic Club of Oak
land. "The men will box at 138 pounds,
weigh in - at 5 o'clock. ; A large crowd
will cross, the bay to-night : to see : the
pair ; fight. Herrera is looked upon as
one of the â¢ best ' lightweights In ; the
business, v His victories over Broad and
other good men give him a high stand
ing in the ranks. Cordell ; Is a youth
who lately sprang from the amateur
ranks. His victory over Jack Kane and
his battle with Joe Angeli stamp him
as a fast youngster. Cordell will
undoubtedly develop into a good
Jimmy Britt started training for
Canole yesterday. He is in perfect
fettle and. will only do light work. The
twenty rounds he went through with
Seiger last week has helped to condi
tion him. : He no longer suffers sore
ness about the arms and body and is
faster than ever. Jimmy punched the
bag in the afternoon, and, after ten
minutes of heavy firing was breathing
easily. His wind could not be better.
He will do no boxing this week, for
fear he might hurt his hands.
Jimmy is confident that he will de
feat Canole. He acknowledges Canole's
superiority over Seiger and looks for a
hard fight. The three days' rest Britt
had after his battle with Seiger did
him lots of good. He took on three or
four pounds and he will have the extra
weight to take off , in the next three
days.
Canole^has not let himself out in
training for fear that people might get
a line on him. He certainly is a two
handed ' boxer, and the question
whether he can punch remains to be
proven next Friday night. Canole has
no trouble making a man like Fred
Landers look like a novice. He has
a true left hand. He seldom uses his
right, but when he lets it. fly it g'oes
with a vim. His right cross, and his
left uppercut aTe his pet punches.
Canole strips big and surprises every
body by the bigness of his legs. Eddie
Hanlon says, it, is a good sign when a
fighter, has stanch underpinning.
RELIANCE CXUB SHOW.
Gardner has cleverness and youth in
his favor and if he can assimilate Fitz
simmons' heavy wallops his chances of
victory are verv good. At all events
the ring-goers will see some fast and
heavy' battling when the pair meet un
der the auspices of the Yosemite Ath
letic Club on Thanksgiving eve.
Fitz's daily work consists of a ten
mile, run on the road in the. morning
and gymnasium work in the afternoon.
The work he goes through in the gym
nasium would affect many men. He
punches the bag for ten three-minute
rounds, boxes alternately with his
sparring partners as many rounds and
toys with the weights and bustles
around with his men. After dinner he
does a hundred-yard sprint up and
down the road to test his breathing ap
paratus. Early to bed is his practice
and he rises at ,an early hour.
Fitz asserts he never felt better while
in training. He is getting over a slight
cold and is becoming acclimated. His
general physical appearance -is good
and his spirits are the highest. He is
surrounded by people he. likes and who
understand him. He has a big bull
dog to keep him company and enliven
his daily runs by fights with other
dogs.
Gardner did a heavy day's work at
Larkspur^ yesterday. He was out on
the road at an early hour and strength
ened his legs, climbing over the hill3
of Marin Ccunty. In the afternoon
Greggains donned his pneumatic pad
and George landed blows that would
kill a man if he were not protected by
an inflated pad. This work is doing a
great deal of good for George. He says
It is harder than fighting, and it must
be, because Foley, Barry and Canole
seldom try it because , it is very fa
tiguing. Every one who has seen
GaTdner in training remarks on his
growth. He seems to have become
broader and bigger in every way.
Gardner admits this and says he is
stronger than he has ever been in his
life. He is still two pounds over
weight, but says he will have no
trouble making 168 pounds.
BRITT IN TRAINING.
GARDNER HAS YOUTH.
Fitz will have no trouble in making
168 pounds at 3 o'clock of the day he
battles with Gardner. At the conclu
sion of his work yesterday afternoon
Bob weighed 165%' pounds in the pres
ence of newspaper men. He said he
was willing to wager $5000 that he
could make 15S pounds if necessary.
The Cornishman is in splendid shape,
there is no doubt about that, but he
shows some signs of advanced age."
Beneath the eyes are little marks that
are usually seen in men who are ad
vancing In years. Fitz is a marvelous
specimen. ' of manhood, however. He
seems- to" possess his old time form
and will give his younger opponent a
hard battle. Kennedy and his other
sparring partner sailed into the big fel
low and Fitz satisfied himself in block
ing the punches with his mighty el
bows or on his massive shoulders.
FITZ DOWN TO WEIGHT.
"1 have examined his heart and lungs
and other organs." said the doctor,
"and I find them to be In perfect con
dition. His heart is particularly good.
1 examined his heart after he had
gone through violent exercise and the
beats were nearly normal and as good
as any athlete 30 years of age. His
muscles are flexible as those of a young
man."
Dr. Clarence F. Tillman, the Yosem
ite Club's official physician, visited
Fitzsimmons at his training quarters
yesterday and made a close examina
tion of the Cornishman. He used a
stethescope and other instruments to
make a scientific diagnosis of Fitzsim
mons' condition.
Although his battle- with George
Gardner is two weeks off, Robert Fitz
simmons is in splendid fettle. His eyes
ore bright and his skin has taken on
the ruddy hue of health. Fitz is as
awkward as ever, but he is there with
his usual heavy wallop. Fortunately
for Joe Kennedy, the horseshoer re
trains from using it in his boxing. Fitz
tries his punches on the heavy bag
and the residents of Alameda imagine
blasting is going on when he sends his
pile driving blows at the inflated
sphere.

tributed the defeat of the four
short-priced ones. It was simply poor
racing" luck. The attendance was large
and speculators recouped their losses
somewhat by setting it in thick on Ben
MacDhui. which won the last event In
runaway fashion.
Elfin Kins w as touted as the real
ripe one for the opening scramble over
the Futurity course, but Step Around.
the favorite, took rare of the King
William colt. Hatidor, a SO to 1 shot, cut
out the running and It took vigorous
riding on the r>art of Hildebrand, who
piloted Stei> Around, to nab the out
sider. At the wire the first choice led
Klfin King out more than two
lengths. Egg Nogg. a 10 to 1 chance,
Iran into the show.
It looked, on paper, as if Matt Ilogan
hnd fallen in with some mighty cheap
company in the f-ix furlong selling af
fair following, but he failed to throw
a natural. Four to five was quickly cut
to 3 to i and Matt got no piece of the
money. To begin with, Ferrell suc
ceeded in getting away very poorly
with the old gilding. Then the Chicago
rider got up to within a couple of
lengths of Quiet and supposed he had
the race won. Hogan doesn't like to be
Jollied, and when Ferrell let him down
he went all to pieces. Quiet, an 8 to 1
:Â»hot. ridden by Heed, experienced no
difficulty in beating Idogo and Madam
Hishop.
Barney Sehreiber's Dorice, a brown
daughter of Sain, and 12 to 1 in the bet
ting, captured the two-year-old scram
ble at five and a half furlongs. Felipe
Lugo, the fast Amigo-Los Angeles colt
from the Kaldwin stable, opened an
even money favorite for the race. By
degrees the j>rice floated to 2 to 1, and
See's handling of the youngster justi
fied the quotation. He fouritl more
pockets than he did on Saturday with
Kenihvorth, and was unplaced with
his mount. Hail, astride Durice, passed
Young Pepper on the stretch bend, and,
in a drive at the elope, led Sol Smith
out a head. Judge, from the stable of
>1. J. Daly, ran a good third. With any
fort of a fair ride. Felipe Lugo would
have won by himself.
Oliphar.t. the apprentice rider with
the Binder stable, should undergo a
course of schooling on how to make a
short turn. Ollphant had the mount
on Lord Melbourne in the mile and
seventy yard selling run. The horse
dosed a IT to lft favorite and was
downed \fp? than a length by Grail, the
second choice. Just before reaching
the str<Mrh turn Lord Melbourne was
almost lapped on Grail, which mare
was making the pace, when Ollphant
made a sweeping swing into the
stretch, losing at least two lengths.
This cost the first choice the race.
Frankie Keed. on Galanthus. put up a
mild* ride, losing" the show to Erne.
Albemsrle went to the post a 3 to 5
choice for the fifth event, and also
managed by Oliphant. finished in the
show. Glenarvcn, a maiden, whose
odds w^rt from 5 to 9 and 10, jumped
away in the lead and was never headed.
Firkaway. a 12 to 1 shot, with J.
Lewis in the faddle. ran home second,
four lengths ahead of Albemarle.
With nothing: much to beat. Ben
MacDhui, at odds of 7 to 10. made a
oathop of the concluding seven furlong
number. Bill Msssie ran second, four
lenpth before Frank Woods.

Marroquin asserts that since 1S35 they
have granted canal privileges to differ
ent companies no less than nine times,
and claims that the treaty concluded
with the late General Hurlbut, when
he was United States Minister to Co
lombia at Bogota, July 8, 1S70, has been
Ignored at Washington. After giving
the previously stated reasons for the
Colombian Senate's failure to approve
the Hay-Herran treaty and asserting
that the delay in the negotiations had
not affected the ultimate issue of the
canal project, the protest of President
Marroquin points out that Colombia
had "constantly endeavored to -act in
a friendly manner with the United
States, even asking for the assistance
of American marines to insure free
transit across the isthmus," says the
rising occurred when the Government
was not prepared, having withdrawn
most of its troops when peace -was re
established last year, and concludes:
"The haste In recognizing the new
Government which sprung up under
these circumstances is all the more sur
prising to the Colombian Government,
as they recollect* the energetic opposi
tion of Washington to the acknowledg
ment of the belligerency of the Con
federates by the powers during j the
Civil War."
The cable message goes" on to say
that President Marroquin has energet
ically protested to the United States
and wishes that his protest should be
known throughout the. civilized world.
The President contends that the United
States has infringed article 35 of the
treaty of 1846, which, he asserts, im
plies the duty on the part of the United
States to help Colombia in maintain
ing her sovereignty over the isthmus,
and adds that the "Colombian Govern
ment repudiate the assumption that
they have barred the way to carrying
out the canal."
a LONDON, Nov. 16.â The Colombian
authorities have cabled to London a
lengthy protest against the United
States' action toward Panama, in which
they claim that the main responsibility
for the secession of Panama lies with
the United States Governmentâ'/first
ly, by fomenting the separatist spirit,
of which there seems to be clear evi
dence; secondly, by hastily acknowl
edging the independence of the revolted
province, and finally, by prevenling the
Colombian Government using proper
means to repress the rebellion."

COLON, Nov. 16.â The Hamburg-
American Hne steamer Scotia, which
arrived off the coast yesterday and
which was believed to have on board
the Colombian General Reyes, reached
here to-day. She had among her pas
sengers a number of prominent Colom
bians, who formed a peace commission
from the Department of Bolivar. Gen
eral Reyes was not on board and the
vessel did not carry any Colombian
| troops. The Commissioners from Boli
var are Dr. Francisco Padvon. Dr. E.
Paraga, Senor Fanon Velefe, Dr. Nl
canor Insignares and General Demario
Dairla. The latter two are from Sa
vanilla and the former are from Car
1 tagena. Dr. Insignares is a brother of
! the Governor of Bolivar.
The United States battleship Maine,
which arrived here last night, is an
chored four miles off the harbor.
The captain of the Scotia, in an inter
view to-day, said:
"On our arrival here an American
naval officer boarded us from a steam
launch and asked if we had Colombian
troops or passengers on board. I in
formed him that we carried no troops,
but that we had as passengers five
prominent Colombians, forming a peace
commission, from the department of
Bolivar.
"We flew the .Colombian flag on
reaching the coast, in accordance with
the usual custom of the port. 1 We were
not required to haul it down. . â¢
"While we were boarded we at the
same time attempted to obey our
agents' signal ,to come along the dock,
but the Mayflower, which was nicely
handled, steamed around and occupied
a position between us and the dock,
thus hindering us from getting along
side. Therefore, as it was late, we
were compelled to anchor In the stream.
"On the invitation of the American
naval commander the Colombian Peace
Commissioners went on board the Dixie
early this morning."
The Commissioners said that both
Cartagena and Savanllla were ap
parently beginning to understand the
situation on the isthmus, and that the
inhabitants were only indulging in re
criminative and futile speeches and
threats. The Commissioners, previous
to sailing, had a conversation with the
United States Consul at Cartagena,
who made no mention of hostile demon
strations. They knew nothing of the
massing of troops at Cartagena or Sa
vanllla.
When the Scotia docked this morn-
Ing the approaches to the wharf were
guarded by Panama soldiers. The ma
rines landed by the Dixie yesterday
evening guarded the railroad buildings
and the town last night and re-em
barked this morning. .
Rear Admiral Walker, who arrived
here yesterday' with Gudger, the United
States Consul General at Panama, and
Superintendent Shaler of the Panama
Railway, went to Panama to-day.
American naval officers are boarding
all the vessels arriving here to ascer
tain If they have Colombian troops on
board previous to allowing them to
dock.
The Colombian Commissioners were
transferred from the Dixie to the May
flower this afternoon. A special train
from Panama; with representatives of
the Provisional Government, Is mo
mentarily expected. The Government
representatives will Immediately go
aboard the Mayflower to learn the pre

considered improbable that the Com

Consul General Gudger, who is
here to direct the relations of the Uni

of the United States Government paid
their respects to the members of the
jiinta Rear Admiral Walker present
ed a letter from President Roosevelt
and there were mutual exchanges of
i good wishes. Otherwise the visit was
quite informal.
The visit of Rear Admiral W alker
and Gudger has been construed by the
junta and by the people of Panama as
a formal recognition of the new repub
lic, and has provoked many expressions
i of satisfaction and congratulations on
the new order of things. It is under
stood that Admiral Walker will report
to President Roosevelt on the isthmian
situation and act in an advisory ca-
I pacity to Gudger, who is well liked
here." Rear Admiral Walker returned
l to Colon this afternoon.
The junta to-day appointed a com
mission comoosed of Senores Arias and
Espinoza to" proceed at once to Colon
and confer, on board the United States
I steamer Mayflower, with the .Colom
j bians. who arrived there last night, on
! what is understood to be a peace mis

ers are from the Department of Boli

i If the commissioners represent the Bo

1 powered to and do recognize the new
i republic of Panama, the matter of re
â¢ muneration to Colombia for the loss of
i the isthmus may be broached.
The Panamain commissioners are
i fully determined to do nothing that

the Senate, Washingtonâ Excellency:
The Government and people of Colom
bia have been painfully surprised at tha
notification given by the Minister of
the United States to the effect that the
Government ,at Washington had has
tened to recognize the Government con
sequent upon a barracks coup in the
Departmentof Panama.
A proposal to authorize Senator Gor
man to appoint a committee of five to
devise a programme on which there
will be at least a fighting chance for
united action was made, and for a time
it appeared that a solution of the dif
ferences had been reached. Several
Senators left the caucus under the im
pression that this course would be
adopted, but objection was raised by
those Democrats who . had supported
Carmack's resolution and the caucus
then adjourned. .
It was said to-night by a member of
the Senate steering committee that the
minority party In all probability would
meet the question of canal legislation
without organization of any kind and
would act according, to Its individiual
opinions.
Censure for the President for his al
leged assistance of the Panama revolt
but pledging support if a canal treaty
were negotiated with the new repub
lic, was the purport of a resolution of
fered by Senator Bacon as a substitute
for the- Carmack plan. This opposite
extreme met immediate rejection. It
was at this point that some of the Sen
ators withdrew from the caucus 'â¢
Two compromise plans were suggest
ed. The first was offered by Senator
Newlands, who proposed that the
steering committee be authorized to
hold a conference with a committee of
Democratic members cf the House to
be appointed by Representative John
Sharpe Williams, the House minority
leader, for Jhe purpose of preparing
some party policy on all matters which
will come Before the Senate In the ex
traordinary session. This resolution
was antagonized, on the ground that
the Democrats of the House have al
ready adopted this plan In regard to
the Cuban reciprocity enabling act, and
that any opinion the House may have
had on the canal treaty could not affect
the position of the Senate.
The resolution, which was discussed
at greatest length, was offered by Sen
ator Carmack of Tennessee, it de
clared the sentiment of the Democrats
to be that the present canal law
should be put into operation by the
President. The resolution declared the
Spooner act to be "the present law"'
governing the authoritative course of
the United States in regard to the
building of a canal and held that un
der that act the President should pro
ceed to the building of the canal on
the Nicaragua and Costa Rica route
It asserted that the "reasonable time"
for acquiring of the Panama route
lapsed at the death of the Hay-Her
ran treaty, and that the President, con
sequently, was left with no alternative
but to build the canal on the more
northerly isthmian route.
In support of this resolution speeches
were made by, Senators Carmack Du
bois. Teller, Blackburn, Patterson and
.others. The speeches were interrupted
by Senators differing from the propo
sition the principal arguments being
made by Senators Bacon, Clay and
Cockrell. It was apparent at the out
set that a motion of such radical char
acter could not harmonize the minor-
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.â Democratic
members ef the Senate caucused to-day
from 12:30 until 5 o'clock, but were un
able to get together on a programme as
to canal legislation. Four distinct prop
ositions were submitted in the form of
resolutions and many ether suggestions
were made Informally, but no agree
ment could be reached and the caucus
adjourned to meet again on call of Sen
ator Gorman, chairman. Several Sena
tors, on leaving the caucus, bitterly
complained of the lack of harmony
which prevailed, and compared the
Democratic position with the attitude
of the Republicans, who. they said, with
twice as many representatives, had not
a straggler, while hardly two Demo
crats wer e of the same opinion. Sena
tor Gorman said of the caucus:

we all talked, and we will do our think

DEMOCRATS ARE AT SEA.
The action of President Marroquin in
sending a protest to the United States
Senate is regarded by diplomats here
as a serious breach of the proprieties,
but the matter probably will not be
dealt with in a harsh manner. Secre
tary Hay has not yet seen the protest,
but will read It to-morrow, and, un
officially, the President may see It, but
it is felt the communication might be
ignored entirely if the Government
chose to do so, in view of the extra
ordinary course taken in forwarding it.
Dr. Herran, the Colombian Charge
d' Affaires, has cabled his Government
that he is isolated here and asking for
immediate instructions. He received a
cablegram dated November 10 from an
official of the Bogota Government, but
it was of a personal nature arjd made
no reference to the isthmian matter. '
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.â In a
note "addressed to M. Bu
nau-Varilla, as Minister
Plenipotentiary and Envoy
Extraordinary of the Re
public of Panama, M. Jusserand, the
French Embassador, to-night officially
recognized the new Envoy and in
formed him he would be received at
the embassy to-morrow by his Excel
lency and duly recognized. The Em
bassador's action is in accordance with
the cablegram received from the
French Foreign Office to-day.
The Minister announced to-night
that J. P. Morgan & Co. had accepted
the appointment as financial agents In
the United State* of the Panama Re
public and that 5300,006 had been placed
to the credit of the Panama Govern
ment. The Minister received by cable
to-day full powers from his Govern
ment to address the Envoys of all
powers represented at Washington and
request recognition at their hands.
"Upon the arrival of the Marblehead
sufflcient^force must be sent to watch
movements closely of the British
steamers seized at Buena Ventura and
to prevent the landing of men with hos
tile intent within limits of the state of
Panama. Protect the British steamers
If necessary."
On the following day the Secretary
sent a dispatch to Admiral Glass say
ing that the British steamers had not
been detained, and asking if they left
with Colombian troops aboard.
The same orders were sent to the
commanders of the Boston and Dixie.
On November 2 the following order
was sent to Rear Admiral Glass at
Acapulco: .
"Proceed with all possible dispatch
to Panama. Telegraph In cipher your
departure. Maintain free and uninter
rupted transit. If Interruption la
threatened by armed force, occupy the
line. Prevent landing of any armed
force, either Government or insurgent,
with hostile Intent at any point within

to the Intent of any armed force, occu
py Ancon Hill strongly with artillery.
If the Wyoming would delay Concord
and Marblehead her disposition must
be left to your discretion. Prevent
their landing if in your Judgment land

On November 4 Acting Secretary
Darling sent this dispatch to the com
mander of the Nashville:
"Gunboat of -Colombia shelling Pan

three-Inch field guns and six-pounders,
with force of men, to Panama to com

Government or insurgent, either at Co

This embraces orders cabled to the
commander of the Nashville at Colon
under date of November 2, which read
as follows:
The brother-in-law was killed in the

Sanchez fled with his band to the

"As to Its costliness, 1 submit actual
figures and facts. I do not know in

made to the excellence of the enlisted

the class of accommodations now pro
vided in all the army transports, then I
favor the continuance of that luxury.

do not claim that there Is an 'inexora

unquestionably a very valuable and

The duties that have been performed
through the transport service, with the
relative costs of transportation by the

According to these plans th* war col
lege will be conducted along the same
general lines as have marked the work
of the naval war college at Newport.
General Bliss is of opinion that stu
dents of the war college will have
necessarily advanced beyond the neces
sity of further so-called book learning
which they will have received at the
schools at West Point, Fout Leaven
worth, Fort Riley, Fort Monroe and
Washington barracks. He has there
fore recommended that the students be
required to apply themselves to the de
velopment of the details of especially
devised war problems. Theso problems
would naturally come from the general
staff. It is also proposed to have lect
ures delivered by officers of the various
branches of the service, with special
and direct reference to . the problem
under consideration. The student offi
cers will be expected to take' up the
questions of grand tactics and strategy
and discuss each subject in'Jts positive
relations to the duties of the army.
H. Bliss, president of the faculty of
the army war college, has submitted
to the general staff a memorandum out
lining the plans of the board for the
part to be taken by the college In the
general scheme of advanced military
education.

she had known for several years, came
to her apartment ostensibly to rent a
room. While she was showing him
through the place Wayner struck her on
the head with a club, knocking her down.
He then pulled her diamond ear-rings
from her ears, mutilating the lobes. Way
ner at first denied his guilt, but finally

Several eyewitnesses to the shooting
state that Wilson provoked the trouble
and that Wright was perfectly justi
fied In the shooting. The people of Cas
tella were so indignant over the affair
that they would not allow Wilson 'to
be taken care of in their homes. On
Uie way down Monday night Wilson
pave the conductor considerable trou
ble and would have been put off the
train had he been well.
When the little pistol began to spit
fire and lead, every one but Wright and
Wilson hurried out. Wilson was only
twelve feet distant from Wright. The
first three shots missed by a wide
mark, and as the fourth shot rang out
Wilson was turning. He reeled and
fell to the floor, painfully wounded. The
ball passed through the leg one and a
half inches above the ankle.
Wilson was brought to Redding Sun
day night and now occupies a cot in
the county hospital. The shooting was
over 40 cents due for drinks that Wil
son claimed he had paid. Wright in
sisted that the drinks should be paid
for and Wilson in his drunken frenzy
grabbed a chair and threw it over the
bar at Wright. There were six men In
the saloon at the time.

ant Colonel Joseph Garard, acting su
perintendent of the Yosemite National
Park, In his annual report, recom
mends the protection of the game in
the forest reserves bordering on the
National Park and reservations; the
return to the old Indian custom of sys
tematically burning over portions of
the forests of the park every fall to
minimize fire danger; amendment of
the rules and regulations so as to ex
plicitly forbid the location of mines,
water and power claims on Govern
ment lands, and any surveying without
the permission of the proper authori
ties; the Government to take immedi
ate possession of all patented lands in
the forest reserve, as well as in the
park; that future acting superinten
dents be given the position for three
years if the exigencies of the military
service permit, and that the park be
made a United States district and that
a resident Commissioner be appointed.
The report estimates that the total
number of tourists who visited the
park in the season of 1903 was 9500. The
report says that the inadvisability of
having the State grant within the Na
tional Park is being discussed and he
expresses the belief that the United
States could obtain possession of Yo

matter were properly brought before

Friends and relatives of Father Cir
ringione believe the story of the priest,
but the police are awaiting further de
velopments before .taking any action
for the discovery of the alleged abduc
tors. Civil Justice Roesch, an old
friend of the priest, was told by the
latter that there were four me^in the
gang which abducted him. Only one
â¢was an Italian. One of the other men
was very rough to him and insisted
that he be killed.
He said that he heard the men say
on Saturday that the papers were full
cf the story of his abduction and this
man insisted that he be killed. The
others objected and managed to get
this man Intoxicated and the priest's
life was saved.
The priest said he had been freed but
a few minutes before he had been found
by the policeman. He said he had been
led blindfolded into the passage and
then the bandage had been removed.
Father Cirringione when he left his
home had a gold-mounted ebony cane.
a valuable gold watch and chain and
some money. When found to-day all
were gone.
"They took me to the ocean," he
said, but beyond this the questioners
could get little in detail of where he
had been. He said that when but a few
steps from the doors of his house the

with his wrists bound.
I'nder the influence of soothing drugs
Father Cirrinsione became calmer and
was able to tell something of his story.
He said that he had been robbed by
the two men who had pone to his home
on Friday nighi and whom he had ac
companied, believing them to be detec
tives.
A hurried examination of the priest's
physical condition was made by a phy
sician, who found that his worst
wounds were two red marks similar to
those that would have been made had
the priest's 'wrists been bound with a
rope.
â¢ When found to-day Father Cirringione
fell exhausted into the arms of the po
liceman, crying out repeatedly: "They
have robbed me, and they will kill me.
Protect me."
Father Cirringione had incurred the
enmity of Italians about Williams
Bridge by a crusade against vice. He
received several ' threatening letters
and had reported the matter to the po
lice, who were endeavoring to locate
the writers. Late Friday night two
men called upon him and represented
themselves as detectives, asking him to
accompany them to the. station-house.
He did not return and it was believed
he had been carried off by agents of an
Italian secret society.
NEW YORK. Nov. 16.â The Rev. Jo
seph Cirring-ione, rector of the Italian
Church of the Immaculate Conception
la Williams Bridge, a suburb of this
city, who disappeared from his home
under mysterious circumstances last
Friday night, was found early to-day
by a policeman on East Fifty-first
street, raving wildly in Italian, and is
sow in a hospital.
MEN SCAMPER
FROM BULLETS
It is believed there are no more fatal
ities, although firemen are still search
ing the ruins.
The injured: Michael Corrigan, legs
broken; Harry Vandevelde. suffering
from shock, in hospital, outcome un
certain; Battalion Chief Andrews,
slightly injured about body. '
Duffy and Schweda were Killed al
most instantly, having been caught un
der a falling wall. Reed died an hour
or two later in the hospital.
The fire was in the large street car
barn of the Cleveland Electric Railway
Company on Holmden avenue and
Pearl street and broke out about 3
o'clock from an as yet undetermined
cause. The employes of the sireet car
company believe, however, that it was
of incendiary origin.
There were one hundred motors stored
within the building, which covered an
area of four acres, and the flames
spread like a whirlwind, necessitating
the calling out of all available fire
fighting apparatus in the city. The
motors are valued at about two thou
sand dollars each. The loss on the
building is placed at 530,000.
The fatalities were caused by a wall
falling upon Duffy, Schweda, Reed,
Corrigan and Vandevelde. At 4 o'clock
one hundred frantic firemen had suc
ceeded in uncovering six bruised and
bleeding forms.
Fireman Schweda was dead when
found; Harry Vandevelde had both legs
broken and was internally bruised.
Robert Reed was taken unconscious
from the ruins. The firemen worked
desperately in removing the ymoking,
steaming bricks from their comrades.
The firemen were constantly driven
back from the ruins of the fallen wall
by the smoke and fire. Half a dozen
streams were directed into the debris
in a desperate effort to cool it suffi
ciently so that the work of rescue could
go on.
The first one rescued was Michael
Corrigan, who was pinioned beneath
a mass of bricks. He was pleading
with his comrades to help him. A dash
was made through the smoko and fire
and Corrigan was seized by half a
dozen hands and dragged to a place
of safety. It was found that both of
his legs were broken. Moaning pite
ously, he was taken to a hospital. The
bodies of Duffy and Schweda were next
brought out.
Ten minutes later Robert Reed and
Harry Vandevelde, bruised and burned,
were taken unconscious from the ruins.
Battalion Chief Andrews, who was
standing a little back of his men, was
struck by large pieces of stone and in
jured about the legs. He was taken
home.

began here last Friday and continues
until next Wednesday, is being held In
the Ninth-street Baptist Church, where
the first gathering of its founders was
held soon after the crusade started in
Hillsboro, O., in 1873.
Some of the original crusaders still
reside at Hillsboro, â¢ among them Mrs.
Eliza Jane Thompson, who became
known as "Mother". , Thompson.
"Mother" Thompson is now In her S8th
year and was unable to get to the con
vention here, so the convention went
to her to-day. "The distance Is:sixty
one miles. Jn addition to' the 500 dele
gates, almost as many* more joined
their pilgrimage.
Onytheir arrival the . visitors were
conducted over the same route taken
by the seventy original crusaders, on
the cold morning of December 24, 1873,
when they began their street crusade,
and then they marched into the First
Presbyterian Church* to - inspect the
memorial room and be received by Dr.
Faulconer, the pastor.
After prayer by. Rev. Dr. McSurley,
the crusade psalm was rea"d ? and the
crusade hymn sung. - ' Addresses were
made by the , national officers and
others with responses from the Hills
boro crusaders. The programme in
the church continued one hour, when
the delegates i and others formed in
line to march to the residence ,of
"Mother" Thompson, from .which place
they proceeded to Armory Hall, where
the citizens served luncheon to all. The
schedule provided for . the " delegates to
return in time to resume their sessions
here in the Ninth-street Baptist
Church, at 3 p. m.
"Mother" Thompson* was able to be
present at tn~e church and sat in the
"Frances Willard" chair.
The "old crusade Bible" was used
during the services in the church.
"Mother" Thompson was presented
with bouquets, and the Cleveland dele
gates gave her a fine Japanese shawh
During all of this time he was beg

without resistance, He caught hold of
the edge of the top of the car when one
of his assassins stamped upon his
hands, causing him to let go. After
he struck the ground, near the end of
the ties, another shot was fired at him,
which struck him in the back, passing
downward through the left lung, and
was the shot that caused hfs death.
WINNEMUCCA, New. Nov. 16.â
Judge. S. V J. Bonnifleld of the District
Court this morning overruled the mo
tion for a new trial for Fred Roberts,
John K. Sevener, T. F. Gorman and
Frank Williams and sentenced them to
be hanged in the prison yard at Carson
City within not leas, than sixty nor
more than ninety days, the date to be
fixed later.
Each of the prisoners made a plea
for mercy and declared his innocence.
Sevener made a lengthy speech, de
nouncing the tDistr/ct Attorney, the
Jury, the witnesses and the editor of
the Daily Silver' State.
The attorney for the defense imme
diately filed notice of exception to the
ruling of the court on the motion for

the night of August 19, in company
with Al Waldman, who had been work-
Ing here with him, to go to Reno. Hav
ing little money he was working hia
way by cracking coal on the engine of
the freight.
Waldman had entered a box car of
the same train and when the train
passed a point near where the crime
was committed Welch started back on
top of the cars to look for hi3 partner,
Waldman. He had gone but a short
distance when he was accosted by one
of a group of men, who asked him
for a match.. He replied that he had
none, and was then commanded to
throw up his hands.' He compiled and
his assailants went through his pockets
and robbed him. Then, while he was
standing with his hands held above his
head, he was shot through the left arm.
A mixÂ«up followed, in whicn it is al
leged he was beaten, shot through the
left leg and thrown or pushed from the'
top of the car.

THE steam whaler William Bay

rived yesterday after a fruitless
cruise. Fifty pounds of whale
bone, secured by trading, and two polar
bear cubs was about all of value that
the whaler brought home with her.
Many whales were sighted, but they
were very Â« ild and took good care to
keep beyond reach of the hunters' har
poons. The bear cubo were given to
Captain Cottle by natives. They were
white when they stepped aboard the

, Manager Clough stated that the com
pany expects to have its thirty-two
miles of railroad between Chico and
Sterling ready lor operating by the md
of the year and a few weeks later the
big lumber mill at Sterling will be start
ed. The new plant is expected to fur
r.ish the bulk of the match supply on
this coast, in Hawaii and the Philippines
and will also ship a large quantity of
material to the company's various mills
in the East and different points in Eu
rope. The plant will also include a pa
per mill, the completion of which is be
ing hurried aa rapidly as possible.
Asked as to whether the- Diamond
Match Company was figuring on an ex
tension of its road beyond Sterling, with
possible connections across the eastern
boundary of the State, Manager Clough
replied that several surveying parties
had -been in the field during the summer
and had just come in, owing to the ap

TO AKIUVE
Railroad officials say that reports of
a sink hole being found in the middle
of the lake, apparently bottomless, and
that accidents have occurred there are
grossly exaggerated. The troublesome
spot, apparently the old bed of a river,
has long since been filled In and ceased
to give trouble. The long stretch of
track across the great inland salt sea
is expected to prove one of the most
picturesque features of transcontinental
travel.
Ilovements of Steamers.
OGDEN, Utah. v, Nov. 1Câ The first
trainâ a work trainâ crossed the entire
length of the treat!? work from the
cast to the west side of Great Salt
Lake over the Ogden-Lucin cut-off this
morning. The connection rails of the
two ends were laid temporarily at
about the middle of the. west arm of
the lake, biit.they will not be perma
nently laid and the last spike will not
be driven until Friday, when President
Harriman and party will visit the cut
off ar.d a member of that party will
perform the ceremony. '
SALT LAKE. Utah. Nov. 16.â The
last rail was laid Sunday on the long
cut-off of the Southern Pacific Rail
way across the northern arm of Great
Salt Lake from Ogden to Lucin,* Nev.
There ia yet a great deal of work to
be done before the cut-off can be used
for traffic, but the track will be ready
for use by next Friday, when President
Harriman and other officials of the
Harriman system will make a formal
trip of inspection of the new line. It
is expected that regular traffic will be
instituted within sixty days over the
cut-off, which is expected to save at
least two hours in running time, be
sides eliminating the heavy expense in
hauling trains up the long, steep Pro
montory hill around the northern edge
of Great Salt Lake.
Several existing ordinances were re
vised and re-enacted to conform with
the charter, imposing a license of $10
per auarter on billposters, advertising
sign painters and streetcar advertisers;
prohibiting the bribery of police offi
cers and regulating the maintenance of
railroad tracks and turntables.
The committee decided to allow Aig
eltinger's bill for hay and other de
mands for goods not purchased under
contract.
The amended ordinance fixing the
width of sidewalks on all streets and
avenues sixty-six feet or more and less
than eighty feet in width at twelve
feet and on all streets eighty feet or
more in width at fifteen feet was passed
to print by the board.
The board ordered the placing of tel
ephones In all the public schools.
The amended ordinance regulating
the plumbing and drainage of build
ings so that the Health Board shall not
determine the method of "siphonage"
was passed to print.
The ordinance regulating the main
tenance of shooting galleries so that
they may be maintained by private
shooting clubs under certain restric
tions was passed to print.
The Health Committee was requested
to take testimony regarding the sug
gestion that satisfactory metnoda of
plumbing may be used other than those
now required by ordinance.
The committee thereupon requested
the City Attorney to advise whether
the Park Commission must enter into
contracts for supplies or labor; whether
the approval of four of tne commission
ers is necessary for the enforcement
of a contract and whether the commis
sion has power to purchase supplies in
the open market without public com
petition in sums less than $500.
The committee objected to a bill of
$1585 25 in favor of E. Aigeltlnger
for hay marked "non-contract" in that
it exceeded the $500 limit. Superintend
ent McLaren explained that the hay
contract had expired two months ago
and as the market price is high it had
been deemed best for the interests of
the city to continue purchasing the hay
for the old contract price, which was
much lower than the present market
rate.
McDonald called attention to what
he termed a technical violation of the
charter by the board in exchanging
copper ingots for a "New England
Kitchen." McDonald said the money
received for the ingots, amounting to
$1000, had not been turned into the
treasury, but went for the Durchase of
the kitchen. McDonald said he had
objected to the transaction as it was
carried on with the * curator of the
museum, who Is an employe of the
board and who owned the kitchen.
Park Commissioners Sullivan. Mc-
Donald and Altman appeared before
the Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday to explain the reason why
the commission does not advertise for
bids for so-called non-contract goods
In amounts less than $500, but Instead
purchases them In the open market.
The committee had withheld approval
of certain demands on that account at
the last meeting:.
Sullivan Quoted the charter, which
says that "every contract exceeding
$500 in amount shall be open to public
competition, but that no contract shall
be entered into authorizing the ex
penditure of " money without the ap
proval of four of the commissioners."
Sullivan also referred to an opinion
of the City Attorney to the effect that
the Park Commission has an entirely
independent power to contract for its
own supplies and materials. Sullivan
said that heretofore contracts had been
entered into by a vote of three com
missioners.

NAPA, Nov. 16.â J. S. Strauss, while
on his way to Napa Sunday evening,
was held up by two highwaymen on the
railroad track a short distance below
town. He was relieved of his purse,
containing $2 80, and a bundle of cloth
ing. He came to Napa and the rob
bers went down the track toward.Val

Sheriff Dunlap and deputies imme
diately started in pursuit. Late Sun
day night Constable Secord saw the
bundle of clothing that had been taken
from Strauss in a saloon. One of the
robbers had left it and returned early
this morning to get it. He became sus
picious and hurriedly left the saloon.
Late this afternoon Sheriff Dunlap and
Under Sheriff Daly started out after
the suspects on the Foss Valley grade
and located one of the robbers at his
father's house, near Atlas Peak. His
name is Wiliam Wende and he admits
having left the bundle at the saloon.

Alfred Rhodes, a private who was
sentenced to life imprisonment on Al
catraz Island but who received a par
don from President Roosevelt, claims
to know the details regarding the
forged pardons which ffave four pris
oners their liberty a few weeks ago.
Rhodes was sentenced to life impris
onment for killing a Filipino a little
over a year ago, but, owing to exten
uating circumstances, he secured a par
don. The story he tells Is to the effect
that one Robinson, a fellow convict,
who acted as printer on the island,
planned the escape of the four and
printed the forgeries that procured
their release. His story throughout is
wild and thoroughly improbable.
Rhodes is living at a hotel on Third

KNOWLEDGE OF FORGERIES
Mrs. Edith Osgood suspects that her
husband knows too much about the
paternity of the club baby, while her
sister, Florry Larkins, entertains a like
suspicion as to her betrothed. Of
course both men are innocent, but a
prior flirtaton between Arthur Cham
berlain and Emma Green and Emma's
demand for the return of her letters
cause a misunderstanding that is at
the bottom of all the trouble. It is only
at the close of the last act that the
mother of the Interesting baby Is
found, but its paternity is somewhere
in the graveyard.
Marie Howe, as Mrs. Law, the mis
chief-maker, achieved a signal success.
In makeup and action she was funny
without trying to be so. and the house
was convulsed with laughter whenever
she appeared on the, stage. Another
splendid bit of character acting is the
part of Jeremiah Larkins, assumed by
George Osbourne. Jeremiah is in dead
earnest all the time and Osbourne
made him so, but his very earnestness
Is irresistibly funny. John B. Maher's
Bertie Law, the henpecked one, is a
clever personation. Walter Belasco's
Major Plunkett is Irish enough In
brogue, but o'er the makeup let the
veil be gently dropped.
The Edith Osgood of Adele Block is
a happy conception and not at all
forced or overdone. It is simply good
acting. â¢ Miss Starr's Florry Larkins
Is a neat bit of soubrette work that Is
thoroughly enjoyed, whjle Grace Good
all's Emma Green Is comical, even In
the gravest moments.
There Is cachlnnation enough in "The
Club's Baby" with which clever farce
the week's bill opened at the Alcazar
last night, to satisfy the most laughter
loving crank. The advent into the club
of an 18 -month -old baby, and
the Jealousy of members' wives,
fanned by the insinuations of
a woman's rights woman, Mrs.
Law, are the grounds for the fun
niest situations. The farce requires a
large cast, but that is because of the
clubroom scene In the second act,
where all the gentlemen are pressed
into service.

ASTORIA. Or., Nov. 16.â The ex
tremely heavy weather that has pre
vailed in the Lower Columbia River
district for the past two weeks will re
sult in early suspension of logging ope
rations, according to the statements
made by loggers doing business near
this city. The rains have so interfered
with the work that the output of logs
has been materially curtailed and it isÂ»
probable that half of the camps will
cease operations before December 1.
In Southwestern Washington, where
the output of lumber has been enor
mous during the year, many of the
mills are reducing their output. Work
ing forces are being reduced, only the
most valuable men being retained.
Many of the mills of Washington and
Oregon have suspended night work,
and the loggers, anxious to hold up the
price of their product, have simultane
ously arranged to limit their output.
The opinion prevails among well-in
formed men that the curtailed produc
tion will have the effect of increasing
the price of lumber or at least of hold
ing up prices.

âThe Viceroy, Lord Curzon, and party,

William Courtenay, as the lover,
Trenwith, Is virile and intelligent, but
not supremely loverlike. Even for him
one's sympathies are left unwrung.
Much the best in the support is J.

most adequately realized by Mr. Man
ners. The Maldonado Is crudely han
dled by Mr. Henry Jewett, who not In

cannot miss "Iris" if but for a glimpse
of what we have here so far happily
avoided. BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Possibly if Miss Virginia Harned, who
appears In the difficult leading role, at
tempted to realize more thoroughly the
suggested surpassing charm of Mrs.
Bellamyâ that enslaves all who come
within her influence, men, women and
children â the play's ' effect would be
stronger. But Miss Harned makes no
bid for sympathy In her interpretation.
She spares nothing of the shallowness,
the meanness, the Intense falsity, the
terrible. littleness ot the character. She
brings to the role a fascinating stage
presence, ample physical beauty, but
these are denied the additional appeal
of feminine softness, a tenderness that
might go with weakness, that would
explain the play's insistence on her
many allurements. But it is a thor
oughly intelligent conception, if not
temperamentally satisfying, and Miss
Harned would be worth seeing in any
thing. Her gowns are the proverbial
dreams, and worn in the way dreams
should be .worn.
Croker Harrington, the third man,
whose only wish is to serve Irisâ though
one finds this quite likable person be
ginning to despise her here â comes in
to tell her of Treuwith's return from
the ranch, successful. And Iris, with
Maldonado In the house, aska Harring
ton to take a letter to Trenwith ap
pointing an interview. Trenwith comes,
she confesses, and the sordid tragedy
is at an end.
Immediately then the Jew, who of all
people In the play alone seems to un
derstand the Inherent depravity of the
character of the woman he loves, leaves
his check book with her. And still wet
from her lover's â Trenwith, this time â
tears â Mrs. Bellamy writes out one of
the Maldonado checks. True, it Is to
help a young woman who has been
robbed by her own defaulting trustee,
but the horror, the mean, miserable,
little horror of the thing, is the first
actual note one gets of this tragedy of
littleness.
. We find her afterward installed in
a handsome flat, deserted by all of her
friends except Maldonado and a third
lover â the only thoroughly good fellow
In the play. Maldonado is paying for
the flat and Iris Is as usual weeping
about it. Almost, this tainted lady is
as damp of habit a% Miss Anglin as
Claire in Henry Millar's "Aftermath."
He still, decently, wishes to marry her,
but she will not.
"Morality," some one has said, "is all
a matter of latitude." Immorality
would seem also to be all a matter of
latitude. The particular depravity of
Ids, a woman with the lust of luxury
bitten Into the very core of her, who is
bought â and will not stay bought, who
wrings her Jeweled fingers through five
acts that she cannot have her cake and
eat it, becomes wholesomely unintelli
gible in the woolly West, her sordid
tragedy not seldom fancied. It is the
fruit of a civilisation o'er-ripe, ripe to
rottenness. Its decadence is of the old
world, not of the new. Here, In short,
are not the "suitable surroundings." In
a country where within living memory
the women marched with their men
folk across the plains, the Iris kind of
woman, her problem, her tragedy, can
not yet make any serious appeal, for
the original of the portrait is lacking.
It is tragedy in another key, so to
speak, and we haven't the ear for its
particular horror.
Iris Bellamy we find first In a luxuri
ous home. She is a widow. She Is 26.
Her late lamented has, however, dis
counted the latter hopeful facts by cut
ting her off without the proverbial
shilling if she marries again.
The second scene â after a dinner
party, discovers Mrs. .Bellamy making
an appointment with her poor lover,
Laurence Trenwith, for an hour after
her guests' departure. She has mean-'
while granted her millionaire lover,
Maldonado, the privilege of an inter
view half an hour before. Maldonado
proposes to her. She accepts tentative
ly. Trenwith comes In then, and it is
discovered that Iris has given to him
such love as she has. But she will not
marry a poor man, and has put Mal
donado between herself and the temp
tation. But Maldonado does not "stay
put" â in current parlance, and, under
Trenwith's Influence, she writes to the
millionaire, declining to see him the
following morning, when her Xull con
sent to marry him was to be given.
And here begins the deadly battle of
Iris' shifting emotions. Now here, now
there, one never knows afterward Just
where she will be found, but always
sure it will be on a lower and yet low
er plane. She goes to Switzerland, per
mitting Trenwith to accompany her
there, who. It seems, is due in a "ter
rible American ranch" to make his for
tune. Six weeks pass and, her lover's
means almost gone, she offers him
money to keep him by har side. Tren
with, a decent sort of fellow, refuses.
Then, of course, Iris loses her fortune,
through a defaulting trustee, and Mal
donado appears again on the scene.
Trenwith, equally of course, goes to the
terrible American ranch, with Iris'
promise to marry him on his return,
Maldonado doing the bless-you-my
children sort of thing over their fare
well.
The problem play met a prob
lem audience, and the audience had it.
The Plnero problem was lavishly con
cededâand given up. The Pinero audi- f
ence, the usual thoughtful first-night
folk that gather at the Columbia, must
also be given up. Mere bewilderment,
perhaps, best expresses the collective
viewpoint, mingled with a rather irrev
erent regard for such of Mr. Pinero's
intentions as made themselves mani
fest to the attendants' intelligence.
People seemed to be asking themselves,
'â¢What is the problem?" "Is it this?"
"Or is it that?" "Or possibly it is th*
other?"
a REEK met Greek at the Colum
bia laet night when Arthur
Wing Pinero's latest play,
"Iris," made its local debut.
audience was large and appreciative;
the floral offerings to the popular lead
er were beautiful and numerous, and a
number of pretty gifts, including a sil
ver tea set and a water set from some
of the members of the company, served
to show that Steindorff holds a warm
corner in the hearts of many admirers.
Steindorff through it all bore his hon
ors with becoming meekness, and the
plaudits which were showered on him
did not detract one whit from his mas
terly direction of an augmented orches
tra and the various vocal numbers
culled from some of the successes of
the present season. All that was want
ing to make the affair entirely perfect
was a speech from Steindorff, but the
acknowledgments which he bowed were
sufficient evidence that he felt grateful
for it all.
Quite a pleasing surprise was the ap
pearance on the stage of an orchestra
of sixty-five pieces, which played the
overture from ."Der Frelschutz," under
Stelndorff's leadership, in fine style,
and followed with "The Dance of the
Hours," from "La Gloconda," one of
the cleverest musclal bits that it can
be any one's pleasure to hear.

â^^ WAS HEVER MORE IN EVIDENCE THAN TO-DAY |
"AT WORK" I
Free Sunday, Nov. 22, 1903
The publisher of The Call, in anticipating the tendency of the times , |
in giving more time to recreation, hunting and fishing, has acquired for |
their exclusive use a series of art pictures which will serve as reminders |
during the busy months of those delightful days passed in the field. 1
"At "Work," the title of the next Sunday Call's offering, is a reproduc- I
tion from an oil painting by J. M. Tracy, an artist whose paintings of I
dogs have never been surpassed. 1
Mr. Tracy had for the subject of this study the celebrated Llewellyn Â§1
setter, "RODEEIGO," who became famous in this country by his clean ||
sweep of bench and field events. . ||
This picture, while it appeals strongly to those who know every point i
in a dog, is perhaps just as interesting to the many who love the faithful |
In handling, color and action, "At Work" is a most life-like study; a I
picture that, when framed, could with difficulty be distinguished from 1
the original oil painting. I
To overlook this is to miss one of the best of the Sportsmen's Series. 1

Prices for ranch Eggs were all at sea yester
dav The situation remained aa before, viz:
Most dealers were averse to making any fur
iher advance, fearing another sharp slump
inter on In consequence, while others were dis
posed to let the future take care of Itself and
charge all the traffic would bear. The former
stuck to 46c as the top. while the latter asked
60c But the great majority of ranch Eggs
sold at the former price. . The clear, cold
weather rendered the market firm, and stocks
were meager all over the street.
The demand for Butter continued good, and
while uome dealers reported a weak feeling
{he majority quoted a steady tone, with the
market absorbing receipts very well.

NEW YORK, Nov. IÂ«. â Prices traversed a

bet the net changes from last week's closing
.are small snd insignlncant outside of a few
cttti. The ear'y tendency waa downward, fol
lowed try a recovery, which was not fully held,
but the closing was steady. The professional
traders argued that the poor response on Sat
urday to the very favorable bank statement In
dicated weak conditions snd they sold the
. t-.riset with so:.-;- confidence at the opening.
The ' eelllug centered uron Pennsylvania, in
which another day's enormous business waÂ»
dofle. About a honored thousand ehan* of
this 'etock were traded In during the first hour,
carrying It down to 111 or >; of a point above
Ia*t week's low le\-el. United States Steel pre
ferred was also under pressure and failed to
share to any extent In the recovery. The mar
ket moved In sympathy with Pennsylvania.
There was an organized bull movement in the
local tracUon stocks, accompanied by vague
rumors of a comprehensive merger Consoli

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The Potato market showed little change from
the previous report and the feeling on good
stock was. steady. The Oregon steamer
brought down 1429 sacks, chiefly Burbanks,
but as the ftteamer did not unload until a
late hour, no business was done on the wharf.
The market was overstocked with Sweet Po
tatoes and prices were easier. Three cars of
fresh stock came In from Merced. Fancy
Onions were firm at a sharp advance, while
common offerings were abundant and dull.
Trade In Vegetables was fair and several
kinds were quoted higher. Peas and Beans
from Los Angeles were firmer, while Lima
Beans were abundant and easier. Receipts
of Tomatoes were light and consisted chiefly
of unripe stock, which moved slowly. Occa
sional sales of fine ripe offerings were re
ported ot $1 per box, but such sales were not
sufficiently numerous to Justify such a quo
tation. Summer Squash was In light supply
and both large and small boxes were firmer.

Garlic was scarce and firmer.

CHICAGO, Nov. 10. â Commission houses
were heavy ttrllers of December wheat, influ
enced by a variety of factors, and as a re
sult of the liberal offerings the market ruled
weak throughout the session. There was con
riderable selling at the start, due to the
rather indifferent cables and favorable weath
er, and December opened a shade lower to a
shade higher at T7'Â«c to Jljio, and after sell-
Ing at 77\c the price started on a gradual
down grade. The settlement at St. Louis of
a line of over two million bushel* of December
wheat at 10c- over the Chicago price wus a
warning to the bears that the deal there had
been abandoned and a decline in the price
there of over 1 cent wan largely responsible in
causing a further loss here. The visible sup
ply showed a larger Increase fKan had been
expected and hetoed In the depression, as did
the poor export demand. After selling down to

lÂ»cal traders in corn were bearish on the
disappointing shipping demand, excellent
weather, with predictions of a cold wave which
would be favorable fur the movement, and
lower cables. December closed *i@T&c lower,

Commission houses were heavy sellers of
oats, due to the weakness In wheat and corn.

The degree of heat sufficient to pro
duce arc light carbons, or graphite, is
not nearly great enough for >the for
mation of crystals. It requires a tem
perature of approximately 6000 degrees
to produce very small artificial dia
monds, and when nature made i those
in her famous diamond beds a heat of
probably not less than 10,000 degrees
was utilized in the process. Â¦
The purpoae, then, of the electric fur
nace in the electro-chemical production
of diamonds is to obtain as high a de
gree of temperature as possible. The
electric furnace is an exceedingly slm*
pie and at once a clever device for pro
ducing high temperatures. In its sim
plest form it consists merely of an
electric arc light joined between two
carbons of large diameter, the heat of,
which is concentrated in a little cruci
ble of graphite.
Of . course, the light of the arc has
nothing to do with the chemical pro
cesses evolved in the crucible, whether
it is employed in the manufacture of
aluminum-silexicon or crystallized
carbon, but it is the terrific heat ema
nating from the arc that consummates
the operation.
It consists of an iron casing having a
lower block of carbonate of lime consti- 1
tutlng the body of the furnace. The
reason carbonate of lime is used is that
it is not apt to split under the intAnaa
GREAT HEAT NEEDED.
Graphite is found in nature in large
quantities, and it may be 'prepared
artificially by dissolving charcoal in
melted iron, and when this mixture has
cooled graphite will be deposited; all
forms of carbon which are neither dia
mond nor graphite are called amor
phous carbon, meaning simply that
they are not crystallized. Amorphous
carbon may be obtained easily by!
burning wood in a kiln, the resultant
product being charcoal, or coal may be
fused in a retort, the product being
coke; if coke is powdered and mixed
with molasses and baked in a furnace
the form of carbon used for arc lights
results; the temperature required for
obtaining this kind of carbon is very
lowâ a degree ranging from 50 to 200
centigrade being quite sufficient.
A curious anomaly relating to graph
ite is that it is one of the best lubri
cators known for machine bearings,
whereas carbon, its predecessor, and
diamond, its successor, are both so
hard and shan> either would cut a
steel shaft to pieces in a few seconds.
In fact, graphite is so soft that it will
leave a mark on paper and is used In
the manufacture of lead pencils.
CONCEBNING GRAPHITE.
Hard, upon the announcement from
Paris of the marvelous qualities of ra
dium and Its value for testing the gen
uineness of diamonds comes a cable
gram stating that making real dia
monds artificially by tlectrldty is a
success. These manufactured stones
are not base imitations, but genuine
diamonds made under the same condi
tions that nature employs, that is,
heat and pressure, and these absolutely
essential factors are obtained by means
of the electric furnace. It is also true
that they are not large diamonds.
Professor Henri Moisson of the Uni
versity of Paris, famous for his re
searches in electro-chemistry, has at
last been rewarded in his attempts to
reproduce the crystallized gem of na
ture so highly valued by connoisseurs
and so much sought after by society.
The manufacture of diamonds by the
electric furnace process Is directly due
to Lavolssier, who showed conclusively
that the diamond waa merely crystal
lized carbon, just as glass Is crystal
lized sand. "When this deduction had
been made by Lavoissier and had been
proven by a complete physical demon
stration, electro chemists set to work
in earnest to devise the same conditions
under which the gems were produced
by nature.
It is well known that the diamond is
but another form of carbon, and as it
is easy to obtain carbon, since it oc
curs in combination in nearly every
thing in nature, including vegetable
and animal life and their fossil re
mains, it would seem not unreasonable
to find a method to obtain the diamond
artificially.
When carbon is found uncombined
with other substances it occurs in three
very different forms, namely (1) as the
diamond, (2) as graphite or plumbago
and (3) as amorphous carbon. When
the diamond is found in the celebrated
beds of Borneo, Sumatra, Brazil or the
Cape of Good Hope it is covered with
an opaaue layer before Its beautiful
properties appear.

MAKES DIAMONDS
BY ELECTRICITY
By multiplying the amperes by the
volts we get the total amount of elec
trical energy In watts. Now, there are
547 watts in a horsepower, and a sim
ple calculation shows that a current
equal to sixty-seven horsepower is con
sumed in generating heat sufficient for
the making of a diamond.
A cavity Is formed In the lower block
for. the crucible, which is made of
molded carbon. In the earlier experi
ments of Moisson retort carbon was
used, but it was found that the intense
heat converted the carbon Into praph
ite, causing it to swell out of shape.
The crucibles are about three Inches
high and four inches in diameter. When
the crucible is set into position In the
hollow block of lime the carbons.
placed horizontally, are directed
through the furnace over the mouth of
the Crucible. The.se carbons are two
inches in diameter and are capable of
carrying a current of 1000 amperes at
500 volts' pressure..
CRUCIBLES OF CARBON.
"Attlcus, a Roman blbliophilist, tralnefi
a large number of slaves to the especial
duty of merely transcribing. There were
five readers for each 100 trained writers
in different apartments, and 500 copies of
a short poem or small book could be pro
duced rapidly and at little cost, less by
far than the boasted powers of the press
with all our modern appliances in the art
of printing. These shorthand slaves could
produce in twelve hours 500 copies of a
poem equal in extent to Tennyson's
'Enoch Arden' and Its accompanying
poems, and for this work they received
one pound of a kind of common corn each,
with a small allowance of wine. This
kind of 'feed* would not go with stenog
raphers of the present day. We have
a fair and healthy scale of prices for our
work and we receive it or we don't work."
heat and because it can be obtained in
solid blocks of large size.
COPYING BOOKS.
"The Assyrians came nearer to the
printing press than did the Egyptians,
for they discovered and practiced a meth
od of rapidly multiplying their writings,
using engraved seals, consisting of cylin
ders from which any number of impres
sions could be made. Naturally intellec
tual advancement was rapid with the In
troduction of 'circulating documents,
books and papers.* for the reading class
was then only the wealthy, even in the
best days of Roman civilization. The
assembled intellect heard the news at the
Olympian games and in the Athenian
theater. ,
WORK OF EDUCATED SLAVES.
"Cicero's shorthand reporters were the
beginning of the stenographic art. without
which we could not get along very well in
this age of newspaperlng. Cicero's plan
called only for the taking down and copy
ing of the proceedings of the Senate by
educated slaves, and these copies were
sent out. Cicero worked on the same plan
of gaining popularity as do the statesmen
who send out the Congressional Record,
public documents and garden seed, and ha
was unquestionably a pretty shrewd poli
tician. It is gratifying, however, to sten
ographers of the present day to know
that we are not slaves as were the writers
and shorthand reporters of those days.
True we have frequently long hours and
laborious work, but one of our profession
will earn more in a single day than did
the ancient reporters in a whole year. It
was. unquestionably, the system of slav
ery which was the bane of ancient civili
zation and the primai-y cause of its ruin.
Capital owned labor; therefore, labor was
cheap and without dignity. Authors dined
upon rarities costing thousands of dol
lars in the case of a single meal, while his
slaves who produced bis books were near
ly starved. The only cost involved in the
production of a book was the sustenance
of the servile writers and embellishers.
Publication was carried on Ju3t as a
plantation was worked In the days before
the war. The largest books, with the
most beautiful and expensive bindings,
could be produced at a far less cost in
dollars and cents than they can be made
in this day. And the same reasons which
prevented modern Improvements in tha
old slave-holding States prevented the in
troduction of the printing press as an or
gan of ancient civilization.
"Julius Caesar, bidding for popularity in
his first consulate, caused thÂ» proceedings
of the Roman Senate to be published
dally, and these reports were taken down
by trained writers, who were called tabu
laril, being what we to-day style report
ers. These reporters were probably only
rapid writers using the ordinary charac
ters. The reports were revised and edited
before their exposure to the public eye,
and were then circulated even in the dis
tant provincesâ Just the same as the Con
gressional Record is now ser.t to the con
stituents of members of our Congress.
Prior to this time the great annals of
the lawmakers were written on tablets
and placed in a room of the pontiff, where
they were accessible to the public. The
people had to go to the 'newspaper,' and
it was not delivered at their homes as
now. This room of the pontiff was a
general reading room, reminding one of
the periodical room of the Congressional
Library.
"Why the ancients had no printing
presses it has been difficult for students
to decide, for they had the material for
making them and paper and pa/chment
for printing, and then, as now, there was
a heavy and growing demand for reading
matter. It was not until the material for
writing changed that' there was much
progress in the matter of spreading the
news. The decalogue was written upon
tablets of stone; the Athenian record, now
known as the 'Parian Chronicle,' was en
graved upon tablets of marble, and next
we find inscriptions on thin plates of
metal and on the broad leaves of certain
plants, on sheets formed of woyf/i texture
from the bark of trees and on the skins
of animals. These heavy and cumbrous
'volumes' were as difficult to handle as
the iron money imposed upon the Spar
tans.
"It was eminently proper that wr should
place a tablet over the grave of Thomas
Lloyd, the first official stenographer to tha
American Congress." said a veteran of tha
art to a Star reporter, "and I have been
deeply Interested In delving into ancient
history to find out when and where short
hand reporting was first Introduced. Even
before the days of printing presses Cicero
introduced a -system of shorthand report
ing, called the Tyronean method, from
Tyro, a freedman. who was one of
Cicero's most expert writers. That even
at that early date systems of shorthand
writingâ stenographyâ came into general
use for certain purposes, and that the
methods were very effective, we may in
fer from a passage in Horace, who. when
addressing a shorthand writer, says: 'You
write in such a manner that you will
have no occasion In four whole years to
ask for another sheet of parchment.'

placed their scrip upon the oil lands in
the. Kern River District. and it had been
been, decided by therDepartment. of the

During the past few years the custom
has been growing among different clas
sified. Industries of the country to meet
In annual convention for the purpose of
advancing their welfare and interests;
and I believe these conventions have
played an important part in developing
the resources and industries of this great
nation. I sincerely hope the California
Miners' Association â¢will continue to
meet each year and, as it has done In the
past, unselfishly perform . the duties
which may devolve . upon It. -Â¦>-Â¦..Â¦
During the last year our association
has not done much active work, because
there was nothing particular for It to do,
but whatever it had to do was done
promptly and efficiently.
Shortly after the adjournment of the
convention last year your president and
secretary were advised by Senator
George C. Perkins and the Associated
Oil Companies that legislation in Con
gress, known as the Dick bill, had passed
the House and was before a sub-com
mittee of the Judiciary Committee of the
Senate for consideration, and that 'there
was a likelihood that it would receive
the favorable recommendation' of this
committee If a vigorous protest was not
made against it. You will remember
that the Dick bill' had for Its purpose
the transfer of jurisdiction from the De
partment of the Interior to the Court of
Appeals of the District of , Columbia,' and
allowed appeals from the decisions of
the Secretary of the Interior or the Com
missioner of the Land Department prior
to 1902. That is. it allowed ; an Â» appeal
from all cases which had been decided
by the Commissioner,, of . the : Land De
partment in reference to the scrlpping
of oil lands by the holders of lieu land
scrip
President C. M. Belshaw delivered
his annual address, which was in' full
as follows:
Gentlemen of the California Miners'
Association: Once again we -have as
sembled in convention for the purpose of
discussing with due deliberation mat
ters of importance to the mining indus
try of this great State. Much good has
been accomplished for the miners in par
ticular, and the State in general, by this
association since its organization some
eleven years ago, and, in my Judgment,
there is more good work to be done by
this institution In the future.
BELSHAWS ADDRESS.
The following were appointed by the
chair a committee on credentials:
Thomas Clark, H. Z. Osborne, W. C.
Ralston. C. C. Derby and William Nich
olls Jr.
An invitation" was 'received from M.
L. Requa to visit the works of the Pa
cific Steel and Wire Company in East
Oakland. Then the convention took a
recess until after noon.
In the afternoon the committee on
credentials reported tnat 345 delegates
were entitled to sit in the convention. \
MAYOR SCHMITZ SPEAKS.
Mayor Schmitz, in behalf of the city
of San Francisco, spoke briefly. He
said that it was a pleasure to welcome
so important a body as the California
Miners' Association. The pioneer min
ers of California were energetic and
directed to this State the gaze of the
entire world. Good had accrued to San
Francisco from everything that bene
fited California. There was no gold
mine in San Francisco, but the State
had annually poured its wealth into her
lap. :
Proposed laws might be considered.
He hoped that the convention would
take up the relations of employers and
employes.- Unless each respects the
rights of the other California would
not attain the greatness that Is hoped
for. The city bade a hearty welcome
to the convention. All citizens of San
Francisco would try to assist the min
ers in carrying out laws for their bene
fit. Mining was a most important in
dustry to California.
valleys as the zephyrs do; the land, of
all the world, where Pandora's awful
box has never yet been opened.
Such, gentlemen, were the people who
so well preceded you; such were, the
pioneers of this great State. And you,
their successors, who carry on the voca
tion they so well begun, you the people
of California hold in great esteem.
During- thepastyear nothinghas been
done along-the line for. which' the associ
ation was first formed; that sis/ 1 to -make
hydraulic mining once, more possible in
the State. I believe -that 'good work
can and should be done along this line.
I have been. credibly Informed: that by
placing a' dam ' in Webber 'Creek/ El Do
rado County, â¢ at a cost of ' not' to â¢ exceed
$35,000, a majority: of Â¦< the , hydraulic
mines Jn that county,, will be enabled: to
resume work. In my judgment/vthis as
sociation should appoint a , committee to
investigate this matter. ..with ..power " to
give the indorsement , of â¢ the , association
to the building of this dam.-and ifithe
plan. meets with thelr.:approval.>to*urge
upon the State and Federal 'officials -the
necessity .' and . feasibility j of â¢' the work.
It Is our duty, to foster hydraulic mining
under .the Xamlnetti" act,"- and- we should
lendr financial Â» aid, " if;' need f be, -to Â¦ those
who ' are endeavoring -to: mine t under < the
HYDRAULIC I MINING.
At our last annual meeting an innova
tion . was started in -the reading â¢ of prac
tical " papers upon i subjects ' relative f to
the different" branches of., mining 'â¢ by
learned, members of- this association. I
am happy to j state that this* feature of
our last convention was^ a< decided suc
cess, .and I desire --to' strenuously urge
upon- you '.the '.continuance .of :these pa
pers' k at- each ' annual' -convention." ' We
cannot r overestimate"-' the â¢ benefit â¢ to .the
mining industry by the preservation and
dissemination" of this practical:informa
tion. These papers have > been printed
in pamphlet form *ahd then .distributed
all over .the .world.Vto the credit of the
State 1 of 'California.' 'Â¦".Â¦Â¦*. ,;: . -^
i It seems to me that; it would not be out
of place -for "this association to under
take in future - to -arbitrate disputes
which may arise between; the mine own
ers and the employes, both; being mem
bers thereof. It-Is certainly for the best
interests of mining, in. Call fornia -that
the relationship existing between ? em
ployer and employe Â¦ should at - all | times
be harmonious and cordial, and.lt should,
in my judgment, be the duty of this asso
ciation to > endeavor to -maintain' these
much to be'deslred. conditions, vl-there
fore suggest, that .methods of procedure
relative to this : matter 'be thoroughly
discussed and decided upon , during; this
convention.-- Â¦â¢..Â¦â¢* - Â¦ ' ' -'Â¦-?Â¦ â¢-â¢Â¦'.-
Since our- last' convention, the 'mines
along, the mother lode /have experienced
a. labor strike, but^I-am happy to state
that the matter was- satisfactorily, ad
justed before- any * serious damage >had
been done to any of Uhe properties in
volved. . 'Â¦Â¦- ,* ;' " 'Â¦'Â¦ '-â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦:.'
During the last session of, the Legis
lature of the State or California several
bills were introduced relative. to the em
ployers' liability and also as to what
should constitute a vice-principal. In the
judgment of many 'of the mine; owners
of the State the 'bills, as Introduced,
if passed, and signed, by the'Gqvernor,
would have worked ! an injustice to the
employer, and,, at the- request of -a- legal
number of members of this association,
a .special, meeting of. the . executive; com
mittee was called for the purpose of. dis
cussing those measures. - The executive
committee met at the office of the associ
ation on February. 2 8Â» 1903, and, after a
thorough discussion, of the subject mat
ter contained in the proposed, bills which
were before the Legislature of. the State,
it was unanimously: -resolved that the
passage of those bills would-be inlml
cable to the mining interests ) of ' this
State and that therefore, they should not
be passed. A copy- of . this* resolution,
duly, attested, was sent to the members
of the Committee on Mines. and Mining
of the. Senate, and I believe also to the
different members of the: Senate, with
the result- that there,' was no change; in
the law. relative to the subject matter
contained in these, bills. / -â¢- - Â» : .
THE I LABOR SITUATION. Â£ ;
As Congress was then in session, it
was most urgent that action* should I be
taken promptly, so, after consultation
with several members of the execu
tive committee and after having ' care
fully read the affidavits and papers pre
pared by the Associated Oil Companies,
your president and secretary telegraphed
to our representatives j in Congress to
use their best endeavors to accomplish
the defeat of the objectionable bill then
pending. As soon^as possible thereafter,
a meeting of the executive committee
was called and the action of your presi
dent and secretary was indorsed and
approved. The result of . our earnest

As the project for the conservation
and preservation of the flood waters of
the State was first promoted by us, I
believe that it should receive our care

line and has been instrumental in pro
curing State aid to be used in conjunc

cessors, the men who, like the potter at
his wheel, molded into magnificent pro
portions the rough clay of a heteroge

of a State: who. for a moment, laid
down the piok and shovel and, with cal
loused hands; took up the pen; who came
trooping from the muddy streams of the
mountains to meet in convention to
frame a State's constitution; who, paus

WORK OF MINERS.
My business here to-day is to assure
you that, although you. or your prede
cessors, are accused of having filled up
and ruined for navigation many of our
most beautiful rivers; although you, or
your predecessors, are said to have
washed away mountains, and with your
mighty monitors filled up canyons, creeks,
streams, rivers and bays and scarred the
beautiful face of smiling nature with
unsightly wounds and livid gashes; al
though others of your fellows have bur
rowed, like moles, deep into the bowels
of the complaining earth and so mud
died the water which we Sacramentans
have to use that some of us make that
as an excuse for using water only on our
lawns; although you have destroyed for
ests for power at your hoists and to
prop open the tunnels, inclines and
shafts with which you have harassed
our common mother; although you and
your predecessors have turned, and your
successors will turn, nature all awry and
inside out. I am here to-day to tell you
that the people of the State of Califor
nia love you none the less; and that,
along with our agriculturists, our horti
culturists, our viticulturists, our lum
ber, cattle and sheep men and all those
who practice the many arts, trades, busi
nesses, professions and vocations which
make up our California of to-day, there
is none who, from tradition or past or
present usefulness to the body politic,
is held closer to the hearts of Califor
nia's people than are those who follow
the profession of mining.
It was your predecessors who gave
California her first start in life; it was
they who. in the short space of a year
and a half, left their homes and loved
ones, crossed the plains, opened up and
settled a 'new country, organized a gov
ernment/far away from other advanced
civilization, and gave to the Union, as
a full-fledged State without probation as
a territory, the magnificent heritage
which you and I so happily now enjoy,
the great State of California.
WORDS OF EULOGY.
Gentlemen of the California Miners'
Convention: It Is a great pleasure for
me to be present with you here to-day
and to participate in the opening cere
monies of this, your annual convention.
This pleasure would be great were I here
only as a citizen of California. But it is
Â¦with a still greater pleasure that, as the
Chief Executive of the State. I look Into
your faces and testify by my presence
to the very great interest that the people
of California have in the great industry
which you represent and to which we
owe our early reputation as a State.
I shall not attempt to tell you what
you and your predecessors have done
for California. That is known of all
men. Nor shall I attempt that easy task
of predicting the future. No one knows
the possibilities of your industry better
than do you yourselves. Neither shall
I give you any figures as to the amount
of gold that California has yielded to
the wealth of the world; nor how large
a cube it would make, were it all mold
ed into one; nor how far it would reach
were it all spun into a wire an eighth
of an inch in diameter; nor how many
millionaires it would make were it equaf
ly divided among all of us here assem
bled; nor how long it would run the
State of California, at $300,000 per
month, were it all put into the State
treasury; nor, in fact, any of these in
teresting, but dry. statistics to which
none of us like to listen. All such mat
ters as these I shall leave to those whose
business it is to collect and, by a long
system of multiplication, subtraction,
addition, division and silence, put into
figures to the astonishment of even the
most hardened.
The convention was opened shortly
after 10 o'clock in the morning in Stein
way Hall by President Belshaw, who
congratulated the miners upon assem
bling once more, and also upon the
amount of moisture that has fallen
during the present season that will
facilitate mining. He then introduced
Governor Pardee, who spoke as fol
lows:
There were no debates on the floor of
the convention during the first day of
the proceedings. Papers of general in
terest to the miners were read, .jrhere
was a hint of a plan to deal with the
labor question in the mines that was
thrown out by President Belshaw. This
suggestion was that "It would not be
out of place for this association to un
dertake, in future, to arbitrate disputes
that may arise between the mine own
ers and the employes, both being mem
bers thereof." There are mine owners
and also mine employes in the conven
tion, and it is not improbable that the
labor arbitration plan will be discussed
quite fully.
GOVERNOR WELCOMES.
The matter of hydraulic mining
within the terms of the law was forci
bly mentioned by President C. M. Bel
shaw in his annual address to the con
vention. He declared, and the dele
gates applauded the statement of pur
pose warmly, "It is our duty to foster
hydraulic mining under the Caminetti
act, and we should lend financial aid,
if need be, to those who are endeavor
ing to mine under the law and are
meeting with organized opposition."
President Belshaw also favored the
proposition submitted by the miners of
El Dorado County for the construction.
Jointly by the United States and the
State of California, of a restraining
dam on Webber or Weaver Creek to
permit the resumption of hydraulic
mining back of the point where it is
proposed to locate the dam.

Judge Niles Searls of Nevada County
was also called upon to address the
delegates and he made a short speech,
pledging his support to the work of the
association. He urged the delegates to
continue in their efforts to secure prop
er legislation for the benefit of the mine
owners of California.
Ex-Lieutenant Governor Jacob Neff
was " introduced to the conevntion by
the president and "Uncle Jake" was
given a rousing reception. He made a
brief speech, thanking the convention
for Its reception, and assured all pres
ent that he would always support the
Miners' Association in Its work.
If Congress intends to build reservoirs
they should be built in the high Sierra,
which is the permanent source of the
water supply. The mine owners should
have their share of the benefits to be
supplied.
If new reservoirs are built and the
old ones repaired, the Government would
secure an income equal to the expense
from revenues for use of the water. Let
us use all endeavor to secure a proper
water supply by the Government, but let
the. supply be first for the mines and
then for those who live in the valleys.
GREETED BY FORTY-NINEBS.
Preserving the forests is not the only
method of securing a proper water sup
ply. Miners do not waste timber, but
they must have a necessary amount for
the mines. The cry to preserve the for
ests is mainly a matter of sentiment.
Water should be stored in the'moun
tains and by building the reservoirs in
high altitudes a sufficient supply could
first be given to the mines and then the
water could be utilized in the valleys
and cities.
Mark B. Carr then delivered an ad
dress on "The Storage of Waste Water
for Mining Purposes." He spoke of
the plans of the Federal â¢ Government
to erect reservoirs in the ; Sierras and
to' irrigate desert lands and made a
plea that the proposed reservoirs be
placed in the high regions of the Si
erras. Continuing, the speaker said:
The crest of the Sierra is a great wa
tershed and it is there that the waters
should be conserved. The average rain
fall of to-day is the same as it waa
twenty years ago and there is plenty of
water for all purposes.
TELLS OF WASTE.
Letters of regret were read by the
secretary from United States Senator
George C. Perkins, who is now in
Washington, D. C, and unable to be
present at the convention, and also
from Frederick Zeltler, both gentlemen
pledging their hearty support to. the
aims of the organization.
Senator Voorhels presented a motion
that the committee on resolutions be
composed of one member from each
delegation. The motion was carried.
J. K. O'Brien of Plumas County pre
sented a resolution that the convention
Indorse Congressman T. A. Bell
as a member of the River
and Harbor Committee and that
the Speaker of the House of Represen
tatives be requested to appoint Con
gressman Bell; also that the Califor
nia Congressmen be asked to secure
Bell's Appointment on the committee.
The resolution was referred to the
committee on resolutions.
H. E. Picket of El Dorado, chair
man of the El Dorado County Miners'
Association, submitted the report al
ready published in The Call relating
to the proposed dam across Weaver
Creek. The cost of constructing the
dam was estimated at $25,000. The
structure would, so reported the com
mittee, hold back all debris that might
result from the resumption of hydraulic
mining back of the dam. The report
was referred to the committee on dams.
Dr. C. T. Deane, secretary of the Cal
ifornia Petroleum Miners' Association,
read a paper on the California oil In
dustry. The paper abounded in statis
tics.. He estimated that the consump
tion of oil In California during the year
1904 would be 30.000,000 barrels. During
the year 1903 the consumption would
reach more than 23,000,000 barrels. The
various uses that will extend the de
mand for oil were recounted. There
were two great oil fields in the world,
he said, the Baku and Kern River
fields. With the increase in the con
sumption of crude petroleum the de
mand for coal was steadily decreasing.
The importation of coal to San Fran
cisco in the first ten months of 1903
had fallen 165,000 tons short of the im
portation for the corresponding period
in .1902. The "ehost of the scrip oil
land thieves had finally been laid." In
conclusion Dr. Deane extended to the
California Miners' Association the
greetings of the California Petroleum
Miners' Association. : .>;:
WEAVER CREEK DAM.
Barrier No. 2 was completed on No
vember 2 and it is believed that barrier
No. l will be completed in the course of
the next few weeks.
These barriers are built on the plans
or the commission and consist of cribs
built up. of fascines made of brush.
The fascines are about a foot in di
ameter, tightly bound together with
Â¦wire, and laid so as to form pockets
about six feet square. These pockets are
then filled with heavy rocks, the whole
structure rising to a height of about fivo
feet above the river bed. There are seven
rows of these pockets extending com
pletely across the river. \ It is expected
that the brush work will hold the rock
in place and have a tendency to consoli
date the debris reaching the point where
the barrier is built. The heavy rock
snouia hold the brush from being swept
away and give stability to the dam.
tively small and no large percentage of
the debris impounded under the direction
of the commission has escaped by rea
son of failures of impounding works.
The total amount of material mined un
der permits during the year Is estimated
at 622,600 cubic yards.
BABBLERS ON YUBA.
In prosecuting the plan of restraining
debris in the Yuba River provided for
by the Caminetti act. the commission
has now completed one barrier, known
as barrier No. 2, and has made good
progress with the construction of the
second, known as barrier No. 1 .
Wiley denied that the peon was the !
lazy, begging creature that some have j
called him. There will be found the in- j
dustrious among that class, while he |
admitted There Were to be found also i
the mendicants, but not to the extent
that had been so often described.
Wiley defended the Mexican's in
tegrity, so far as it touched their deal-
Ings with Americans. He had occa
sion to observe matters which came
Ix-fore the courts for adjustment and
in every instance the American re
ceived full justice and absolute fair- i
ness, he said. AH the old feeling of j
antagonism had gone, had been elim- I
inated until now there was a spirit of j
the most cordial friendship for the I
Americans who reside or do business in !
Mexico. If Americans failed to do busi- i
ness in that country, he said, it was ;
due alofte to their absence of respect i
and deference.
Mr. Wiley was at a loss to account
for the r>f-rsister.t clinging to the bull
Dgbt, in spite of the attempts of the 'Â¦Â¦
government to end the barbaric cus- !
torn. It was. he said, surprising that a '
people so full of romance, so inclined to !
beautiful music, should still demand !
the continuance of the bloody scenes
of the arena.
MEXICANS ABE JUST.
Wiley imr>rer5ed upon his hearers
that there were free schools through
out the land and that the English lan
jruagre was generally a part of the
education. Old palaces and convents,
he said. h3d been remodeled and put
to public uses, and, while the exterior
lemained the same as of yore, the in
terior of moat of the buildings in the
city of Mexico was made lavish with
the most modern of furnishings.
The lecturer told of the regret of
tourists who noted the growing cos
mopolitan life that was rapidly re
placing the picturesque characteristics
of the past. In the interior of Mexico,
however, the touch of modern conven
tionalities had not yet interfered with
the people, for there couid yet be found
the ease and the old-time life of the
land.
"What Mexico Is Doing To-day" was
the lecture given last night at the
Academy of Sciences by H. R. Wiley,
the special lecture on Jurisprudence
at the University of CaJifornia.
The audience lllled every part of the
auditorium, and for nearly two hours
followed the lecturer with interest. It
was a lecture illustrated with remark
ably good lantern slides, which aided
the graphic and lucid description given
of the country ami habits of the peoples
of Mexico. Mr. Wiley gave the fullest
description of his travels, and, while
describing the Mexico of to-day lin
gered, to the doHpht of his audience,
upon the old and ancient land and the
customs of long ago. He told of and
showed iMCtorially the grand cathe
drals and lesser places of worship and
pave highly colored work sketches of
the old palaces and the rich gardens,
and the scattered and lonely estates,
with their suggestions of feudalism.
UELIODrL OLD 3UTLDINGS.
J. A. Filcher of the California Com
mission to the St. Loufs Exposition de
livered an address to the delegates and
spoke of the plans to give publicity to
the resources" of California at thp
World's Fair in 1904. He asked the aid
of all mining men to make the mining
exhibit a noteworthy one and requested
that specimens of ores and minerals be
sent to the commission for exhibition
purposes.
"If the miners are afraid to loan ex
hibits to us," he said, "we are ready to
buy them. We want to make a good
display and we must have the aid of
every mining man."
President Wheeler of the State Uni
versity was expected to be present and
address the convention, but he was un
able to attend.
The convention adjourned until this
morning at 10 o'clock.
The committee on resolutions sat in
council at the Lick House until a late
hour last evening. It was decided,
after some discussion, to recommend to
the convention to adopt a resolution
favoring arbitration in cases of dis
agreement between mine owners and
mine employes, and to indorse tha
proposition of the miners of El Doradu
County to dam Weaver Creek that hy
draulicklng may proceed behind the
barrier to be constructed. A resolution
will undoubtedly be adopted favoring
the institution of a national depart
ment of mines and mining. The rec
ommendations in President Belshaw'a
address were favored.

tific means taught to students of for
estry and 3aid that more could be
learned from the Indians, who pre
served the forests by systematically
burning patches of woodland.
URGED TO AID.
He displayed dualities of enterprise
which commended him to the special
favor of the . post. " He went to
Washington as a delegate to the Na
tional Encampment of 1902 and was
among the foremost In the fight to
bring the encampment of 1903 to San
Francisco. Many of his friends ex
pected that he would be elected de
partment commander, but General
Shafter was chosen to fill that position.
Many of Colonel Cutler's friends hoped
that he would be placed at the head
of the general committee of manage
ment of the National Encampment.
but General George Stone was selected
for that place.
Thomas Post of San Francisco la
known throughout the United States as
a Grand Army post of exceptional en
terprise and strength. The roll of
leadership in the post embraces the
names of eminent men. There Is a strong
feeling In favor of maintaining the
high standard of leadership, hence the
forthcoming contest for post command
er is enlisting keen attention In Grand
Army circles. The result may have
some bearing on the election of a de
partment commander to succeed Gen
eral Shafter.
There will be a meeting of George H.
Thomas Post. Grand Army of the Re
public, this evening. Nominations for
officers of the post will be in order.
The annual election will take place two
weeks from to-night. There are two
candidates in the field for the honor of
commanding the post. The aspirants
are Selden Sturge3 and P. L. Turpin
and all signs point to a hot contest.
Comrades all along the line are dis
cussing the merits and incidents of the
controversy. It was supposed until re
cently that Selden Sturgsa, who was
made commander to succeed Colonel A.
D. Cutler, who resigned shortly after
the close of the National En
campment, would be re-elected
without opposition, but there is
now gossip to the effect that Com
rade Sturges was placed at the head of
the post on an agreement that he
should give way to another comrade at
the expiration of the term for which
Colonel Cutler was elected. The cus
toms and traditions of the poat were
set aside when Colonel Cutler was
elected for a third term. .
